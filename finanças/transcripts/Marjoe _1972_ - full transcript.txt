MARJOE'S MOTHER (OFFSCREEN): And all across the nation for the past four years, the little preacher has been going up and down, winning lost humanity with the message of the Master. At this time, let me introduce to you Little Marjoe. -Howdy, neighbors. May the Lord bless you. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): When I would go to a press conference or an interview, my father would march me in full outfit right up to the news editor and say, I want to see the editor. They would be so shocked at a six-year-old kid coming up with a full handshake. And I would say, you know, how do you do, Mr. Smith? My name is Marjoe Gortner. I'm in town to give the devil two black eyes. The guy's falling out of his seat. And he would say something back, like, you're a minister? Yes, that's right, the Lord called me to preach when I was four years old. Do you memorize your sermons? Absolutely not. No, I get them in my sleep. Sometimes I get them while I'm driving down the road. But they all come from God. YOUNG MARJOE (OFFSCREEN): Just as sure as you're listening to me, just as sure as you're listening to an eight-year-old voice, just as sure as you're playing a record, it's just as sure that you're going to go to hell if you're not saved. I stand firm in my belief that the Bible is the word of God. Raymond, wilt thou has this woman to be thy wedded wife, to live together after God's ordinance in holy, sacred matrimony? Wilt thou love her, honor her, cherish and keep her in sickness, in health, as long as you both shall live? -I will. -Alma, wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband, to live together after God's ordinance in the holiest state of matrimony? Wilt thou love him, honor him, cherish and keep him in sickness and health, and leaving all others, cleave only unto him as long as you both shall live? -I will. -Place this ring on the 4th finger. -If the law of the state of California does not define what a minister is and recognizes the child of four years as a minister, then we should bring about change in the law and insist that a minister be at least 21 years of age. -Those whom God has joined together, let not man put asunder. Raymond, salute your bride. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): As far as I'm concerned, a thing like this savors of a sordid sensationalism that is disgusting. It is a dangerous reflection on the sanctity of marriage. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): The name Marjoe is a combination of Mary and Joseph. When I was born, it was really a miracle, because I was born by Cesarean, and when they opened up my mother, the cord was wrapped around my neck three times. So I guess I did start off with a legitimate miracle. -At this time, I would like to present to you the world's youngest ordained minister and the world's youngest evangelist, Marjoe Gortner. Marjoe started preaching when he was three and a half. Today is Marjoe's eighth-- I remember my mother going through very, well, correctional activities, you might say, to get me prepared to say the wedding ceremony. Because I had to recite the whole Episcopal ceremony verbatim and write my name on the certificate. I'm not sure, but I think they had a preaching number planned for me, coming from such a long background of preachers and my mother being a very flamboyant evangelist. As a child, I'd want to go out and play, and would have to spend hours and hours memorizing, and my mind would slip. Finally, my mother would begin to lose her patience with me, and she would put a pillow over my head, maybe, and smother me for a little bit. Other times she'd hold me under the water faucet. But she never wanted to put any marks on my body, because she knew I had to be in front of the press, and so she would never hit me or anything. YOUNG MARJOE (OFFSCREEN): I thank God for my fine Christian mother that pointed me to Jesus. If we had more good Christian mothers that would teach the boys and girls how to play more instead of drinking cocktails and smoking filthy old cigarettes, we would have a better America, better men and women, and not so much juvenile delinquency. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): There'd be, you know, gestures. Like when I would say "Jesus," my arms would have to go out, and when I would say "the devil," I would go forward. And she had this incredible set of signals. Like if she would say, "Oh, Jesus," if I was going too slow. Or if she said, "Glory to God," you know, that meant, you better speed up and go a little bit faster. Then later on, they came up with more signals. Like "Praise God" meant, you know, you've got the people where you need them. You better take an offering and raise some money. [laughter] YOUNG MARJOE (OFFSCREEN): Oh my friend, listen to me. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): (SINGING) My name is Marjoe Gortner. I'm only four years old. I'm coming to your town to shoot the devil down. So come and go with me and surely you will see me preach the old-time gospel and have a jubilee. Everyone praise the Lord! I guess I was sort of precocious, and I had an ego, you know. And I enjoyed the people and I enjoyed the attention that I was getting. I remember I really enjoyed-- everyone was very nice to me. And my reaction to it, like I didn't understand. I didn't really-- I can't really think of a time that I ever believed in God or in, you know-- and I ever thought that was a miracle of God that I preached. I don't think even with all the people gathering around me, you know, thousands of people saying this has to be a miracle, surely God has called you and all that-- I don't think with all that. I just knew that I could do it well, and my parents had trained me, but I never really tripped out and thought that I was some real miracle child of any kind. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): OK, August 7, "Marjoe" Roll 2-7254, motel or hotel scene. Slate it. Last slate, but this is August 10th. [women laughing] This is August 10. -What picture are we on? Three. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Two. Three? -All yours. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): It's all mine? Fantastic. Have any of you had any experience with the Pentecostal movement before? Like that's the main thing. Or what kind of religious backgrounds, if any, do you have? FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Larry's got a lot. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I'm an angry ex-Catholic. -OK, what's yours? MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I used to be a Communist-- no. I used to be a Baptist. -How long ago? You haven't gone to church recently or anything like that? MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Not lately. -OK, number one, the little lovey locks have to go. [laughter] -No, just remember, you're dealing with people-- they say they love you, right? And they love Jesus. And they love you-- like if you came in and you weren't part of a film crew, they would, like, turn to you and want to help you to get saved. But being part of the film crew, you're going to have to let this go so that you don't get bothered. Because a natural thing that they have is to want to, like-- they're zealous. They want to convert everyone. They want you, you know, to be saved. And if you look like this, they would be approaching you immediately. Because everyone-- the whole reason for the whole thing is like, can I get someone saved? You know, can I lead someone to Jesus? Can I win someone else? And so you've got to, like, cut the locks, man. -I thought I'd get a wig, you know? I'd get a wig and I'd put it up. And then during the shooting, for the payoff at the end, you know, I would do sound and then I'd rip off the wig and give myself to Christ. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): That's great. I can make a lot of money with you doing that. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): If they ask if you're saved, don't hesitate about it. Never say, well, uh, yes, I'm the right way. Well, we want to help you. And they'll want to lead you. Well, here, you want a little scripture? Maybe this'll give you a little comfort. You just come right back at them, look them straight in the eye, and say, yes, brother, and I'm washed in the same blood as you. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Great. -You know? I mean, it all comes in the blood. You'll be hearing all these songs. Power in the blood, are you washed in the blood? I mean, it's a very bloody, gory religion that's going down, you know? And as long as you say you're washed in the blood-- [sigh] it's cool. They'll leave you alone. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): How suspicious are they going to be of everybody, though? Are they actually going to be laying in wait? -They're not going to be suspicious. No, they're-- remember, they're on your side. Because they accept me as real, number one. And so me bringing you in there, they've already accepted you. The only way that there would be a bust is if one of you blow it. That's why you've got to be very-- I'm actually over-cautioning you so that you'll be really careful. Because no one is going to say, well, I wonder about those people. Again, there's the Hollywood, the movies and things like that you've got to be careful of. But you want to just be prepared for it all. And another thing-- no smoking. You. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Absolutely. And listen, you can't even go outside of the tent or an auditorium and smoke on the grounds. I mean, nothing in your pockets. And you've got to use Binaca. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): I mean, I'd carry a whole bunch, you know? -How many [bleep] sacrifices I gotta make for this job? MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Well, it's all for Jesus. I mean, you know. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): He did a lot for you, man. [laughter] -The blood industry, yeah. -Right, right. You know, it's all under the blood, right? All the-- you know. I used to smoke, I used to drink. Like, you know, I've got this riff that you go through sometimes. We go, for seven years I was a heroin addict, pill dropper, LSD tripper. High riding and low sliding. Busting heads and dropping reds. Kicking in doors and banging whores. Setting tires and slashing fires. But then I met a man who was hung up for hangups. You know? [laughter] -I mean, that's the kind of testimony. You give up all that stuff, you know? That's all, you know. -And there's another thing. What if they say, what kind of movies do you people usually do? [laughter] -Films. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): No, a lot of documentary movements, and you know, that you've really become very interested in this growing Jesus movement that's happening. And listen, I mean, I can tell by looking at some of you that you're into women, maybe, a little bit. You can't chase any of the little loveys around the tent. A lot of these girls, there's like revival groupies, too. FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Really? -That'll hit on you. Sure, man. I mean, they'll see you walking around, they'll see a film crew-- listen, keep it in your pants. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): You cannot in any way-- don't even-- don't even flirt at all. Because they'll come up-- I mean, just be nice and friendly, and smile. But you cannot get involved with these chicks at all, because that's one rule that I definitely established. It makes it really hard for me, traveling, living in motels and that, is that I never take out a girl from the church or in the church, you know? I stick with airline stewardesses. MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Never? MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Are we going to film Marjoe's crucifixion when they find out about all this? [laughter] -What will happen when they find out about that? -What will happen when they find out about it? -I mean, when the movie comes out. -Well, I'm hoping that they'll see, you know, that it's not necessary to look to some person to, like, jerk you off to get off and put your belief in. [singing] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): To me, getting on the stage, the dancing, the preaching, that's fine. But the things I have to come down about-- the sin, the burning, the hell-- that's really a drag, you know? And I'm hoping that maybe they'll see that that's not where it's at, so that you can, like-- you can go if you want to do it in church or at a rock concert. As long as you get off, that's OK. But you don't have to worry about everyone someday going dangling up to heaven. We're going to walk on those golden streets, you know. -Glory! Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Praise him. Praise him. [congregation clapping along] RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Come on and praise God! Yeah, you just come on and worship God, amen. (SINGING) Ohhh, all right! And I'm so happy. Oh, now that I'm so happy. Now that I'm so happy in my soul. But I'm so happy, now that I'm so happy. (SINGING) And I'll say yes, yeah. Sing it! Yeah. I'll say yes, yes, oh, yes. I'll say yes, Lord. I'll say yes, Lord. -My, my, my. I can just see Jesus on his way up. Hallelujah. Going up into the sky. I'm going up. Hallelujah. And I can see him as he starts to goes up. My, my, my. And what does the Bible say when he go up there? Praise God, he sat down. Hallelujah! Oh, praise the Lord. Whenever you hear of a high priest sitting down, that means that his work is finished. Hallelujah. So when Jesus sat down, brother, the Holy Ghost had to get up, oh yes he did. Hallelujah. I see that's Holy Ghost as he begins to come down. I see those 120 people as they make their way up into the upper room. Oh, hallelujah! They shut the windows. They locked the doors for fear of their lives. But I seen them as they got down on their knees and they began to pray. And I seen the Holy Ghost has cloven in tongues of fire, whereupon, hallelujah and oh my, the Holy Ghost finally found a permanent resting place. CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah! CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah! -Hallelujah. He wants a permanent resting place in your life. Have you given the Holy Ghost some resting place, or have you given him a full resting place? Lift up your hands tonight. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Lift up your hands and worship the Lord. [congregation murmuring] -Praise him tonight. Hallelujah. [speaking in tongues] Oh, God is so real tonight. If you can't feel the Holy Ghost tonight, man, you're dead and you don't know it. So why don't you praise him? Why don't you call upon his name? Why don't you worship the Lord tonight? Oh, lift up your hands and praise him. Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah! Oh, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah! [organ playing] -Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Now some people, you see, they've taken these prayer cloths for their son or their daughter who is in drugs or dope addiction. And they've given that prayer cloth to them, and I've had many testimony of a young person, after they got one of these prayer cloths, they were delivered from drugs. How many believe that God can work this way? Do you believe it? Praise the Lord. I want you to get out the largest bill that you have right now. If you believe-- if you don't have that much faith, then you shouldn't come down anyhow. Even young people, anyone who wants to come down, if you want to believe for someone in your life, I want you just to give. If a $20 bill is the largest bill you got, then I want you to get that out. If it's a $10, I want you to get that out. If it's only a dollar bill, I want you to get that out. But I'm asking you to prove God with whatever the largest offering that you have tonight. Anyone else who wants to, right now, stand to your feet. All right, I want you to make your way, and as I lay hands on you tonight, I want us to sing that chorus, "There's Victory in Jesus." About the key of A or A-flat. Hallelujah. Everyone sing. (SINGING) Well, I've got victory in Jesus. My savior forever. Well, he sought me. -Oh, hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah. Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Anybody. [congregation singing] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Hallelu, hallelu, thank you, Jesus. Thank you Jesus. [congregation singing] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelu. Yes, sir. In Jesus' name! In Jesus' name! In Jesus' name! Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah, hallelujah. Praise the Lord Jesus. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Oh, thank you, Jesus! Free your mind, brother. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. In Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. [evangelists singing] -In Jesus' name! RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Listen to me. Everyone that's got an ache, everyone that's got pain, everyone who's got trouble, sorrow, heartaches, whatever it is. Joe, I believe it was you who sang I'm so glad that Jesus set me free. He'll loosen that leg of yours up and that knee, hallelujah. Got to loosen these joints up as right as they'll go. Hallelujah. Come on! Dope'll go! Narcotics'll leave you! Sin'll go out of your life! Come on everybody, that you want something from God. I want you to start praising him! Come on and praise God for your freedom! You're not bound. You're free! You're not bound. You're free! Come on, jump! Bend that leg in Jesus' name, step out! Step out in the name of Jesus! Step out in the name of Jesus! Step out in the name of Jesus! Lift that leg up. It'll loosen. It'll loosen by the power of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Hallelujah! He's free right now! He's bending that leg right now! God's a-setting him free right now! The doctors said he'd never do it! Over a year it's been stiff, but tonight, it's free! Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. -That's right, thank you, Jesus. -Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. -Oh, hallelujah. -Hallelujah. -Hallelujah. -Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. -Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus. -Hallelujah! This is God's day. And if it's God's day, it's you're day. Hallelujah! This is the day of the children of the Lord. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! [man screams] -[screams] -Brother, say Jesus. Right now, Jesus. Say Jesus. -Jesus. -Stay it again, Jesus. -Jesus. Jesus! -In the name of Jesus, brother, be unleashed. Be set free right now. (SCREAMING) I'm sorry my Lord! -That's right, say Jesus. Just say Jesus. [all shouting] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): There's the experience where you say you're saved. Then there's the fire baptism when you get the Holy Ghost, and that's the tongues thing. And they love to work people over. You've got to, like, shoot in on this. When you see people gathering around, people start laying hands on and praying with someone, you've got to come in with the camera, too. It's very important. Because they'll be laying hands on someone. The poor person'll be saying, you know, thank you, Jesus. Now this is a person that's already saved, but they're getting the baptism. And someone will be standing there and be going-- [speaking in tongues]. And the poor person'll be standing there, and they're not saying anything. Then after a while, about four or five more will gather round, and they'll start doing the same thing. Come on, speak it out, speak it out. Till all of a sudden, the person gets so overwhelmed by the thing that they start going-- [speaking in tongues]. And the next thing-- ah, that's it. You've got it. Like they feel good. We got another one, you know? Then they'll go on to the next person. RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): [speaking in tongues] Hallelujah, come against all the powers of Satan. In Jesus Christ's name right now, I rebuke the powers of darkness. [speaking in tongues] [women speaking in tongues] [women speaking in tongues] That's a good sermon, boy. -Thank you. Coming from you, I think that's a compliment. [laughs] -[inaudible]. -Find out where that dove went. -Oh, that climax on that dove was it. I like that. -I got that when I was down in Texas. You know Fitzgerald? -Yeah, old Fitzgerald. -I preached that the first time at his church. -[speaking in tongues] RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): You count the big stuff, and I'll count this. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): OK. You gonna trust me? RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Oh, I think I'll trust you. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): OK. [laughs] 20, 40, 50-- [continues to count softly] RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): You sure will get it straight. [laughter] (SINGING) I said, are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow? Thank you, Jesus! Are you washed in the blood of the lamb? Jesus is so good to me tonight. Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus. I praise the Lord. Oh, glory, glory, hallelujah, I feel good in my soul. Ha ha, praise the Lord. Oh! Sure isn't as heavy as it used to be, though, in the old days. Wow. Was really heavy then. I can remember how I used to have to go down and work with my mother and father, the whole thing. Money, money, from the time I was four years-- I really supported them, you know, when I was a child, come to think about it. I remember how they used to send me down into the aisles, and I wore these little velvet pants, and Lord Fantuan suits with satin shirts. But my mother would sew extra pockets into the suit so I could stuff money. They would announce, tonight-- now everyone tonight that gives $20, little Marjoe's going to come down and give you a kiss. All these little lovely old ladies that wanted to get their fingers in my little curly locks. Then after I'd fill up my pockets, I'd come back and my father would alleviate me of the money. I don't even remember what town it was in, exactly, but all I remember is he took off. We were in a meeting. He left a note. He preached the meeting one night, and if I remember right, I think he took the offering, too. I don't know how much came in. As far as I can guess, maybe about $3 million from the time I was 4 to 14. And I have no idea what happened to that money. I know that I never saw it, or I never got any piece of it for my education or anything. I traveled with my mother for about close to two years. Novelty was wearing off of a child preaching. Our money had run out. We were more or less living at that time from meeting to meeting. Finally, I guess I was close to 15, about 14 and 1/2. We were in Los Angeles at a meeting. I said to my mother, I said, this is going to be the last time I preach. I said, I'm not going to do it anymore. So I stopped. I spent, from then, the next 2 and 1/2 years, I met a older woman on the beach and in a nightclub, and we danced. And she invited me into the home, and I lived with her. And this time was, uh, very-- a transitional period. It was a good change for me. All I can say is I felt toward her more like I would have liked to have felt toward my mother or toward a mother. It just felt good to have someone care for me as a person. I mean, I didn't have to get up and preach. I didn't have to put on a performance at night. I could just be myself, and like, she took care of me and loved me. -Do you feel that you missed out on a lot that most kids between the ages of 4 and 18-- -No. No. Not anymore. At 18, I was really bitter. I was going to get lawyers and sue them, because I felt I'd supported them. They gave me no money. I went through that adolescent thing of being very bitter. And there were so many things that I was naive-- there was little things I had to find out, just about life. I never told anyone about the life I'd led as a preacher. I took all my scrapbook clippings, everything I had, and I sort of hid them away. And even my closest friends at the time didn't know. I felt this strong resentment toward mainly, my father. My mother, too, but mainly toward my father. Because I was a child, and he hadn't put any trust fund away. But then I started, you know, hanging out with people who were into nonviolent movements and so forth, and I just sort of began to find out within myself that you can't hold resentment or strong things against other people. There's no sense in hating anyone or holding hatred toward any people. That's ridiculous. The only person it's going to hurt is me. Why should I hate him? I mean, he did his thing, you know, and that was cool. Why should I hate him? I believe in karma. Those things-- I don't need to take care of it. All those things that you do bad will eventually, some day, come back on your head. I just think that'll take care of itself to him. [music playing] [applause] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): That is just beautiful. [singing - "glory, glory"] Lift up your hands and praise him tonight. Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. This afternoon that I'm going to relate to you is no different than any other afternoon, except I had a visit from Jesus, praise the Lord. She put me up to sleep. I don't know how long I was asleep, but I remember I awoke. When I awoke, I was seeing a vision. I remember, I looked up out of my little bed and I saw a mass of people. They were perishing. They were crying out for help. They were crying, somebody do something! Now remember, I'm only four years old. And I remember, I sat up in my little bed, and I looked up and I said, someone help all those people. Then a voice spoke back to me, just as clear as though standing right alongside that bed. And that voice said, Marjoe, you can help them. And I remember, I looked down at myself and I thought, why, I'm just a little boy. I'm only four years old. What could I possibly do? What could I possibly say? And you know, that voice spoke back to me and said, I was with David, so will I be with you. Hallelujah. As I was with Jeremiah, so will I be with you. Then God spoke the crucial word. He said, will you preach the word? Right there at the age of four, I had a decision to make. And I said, yes, Lord, I will. CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): Thank you, loving God. -Hallelujah. CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah! -And I dedicated my life to God. Praise the Lord. And you know, I fell back in my bed and I had just the greatest peace and tranquility. I even went right back to sleep. I never said a word to my mother and father. That night was a church night, and I got up. The choir was up there to sing, and they announced that I was going to sing my little song. But I said something different. I said, you know, folks, I'm a preacher, too. Praise the Lord. And I began to preach. And I'll tell you, the Holy Ghost began to fall, hallelujah. And there were people who came running to give their hearts to the Lord Jesus Christ because of hearing the little words of a child. I remember one lady in Louisville, Kentucky. She came down in a long prayer line. I don't know how many I prayed for-- maybe 100, 150. But as she came down, she had an open, running cancer, right on the side of her face. And I remember, I reached out and I put my hand right on that cancer. My mother, she pulled my hand back. She didn't want me to touch that open sore. But I went on ahead and I prayed for her. She went on, and I knew that God had done something. The very next night, that lady came back. She was sitting right in the front row. That night when she went home, that cancer had dissolved and run completely down her face. She was healed by the power of God. And the only thing that was left was a little irritation mark, a little pink skin-- but the skin was new like a baby, hallelujah. Only because she believed! Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lift up your hands and praise him tonight. Glory, hallelujah. Well, go ahead, praise the Lord. Praise him tonight. Thank you, sweet Jesus. Hallelujah. [MAN SPEAKING LOUDLY IN TONGUES] -Lift up your hands and praise the Lord. I said lift up your hands and praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise him tonight. Thank you, Jesus. If you can't feel God here tonight, you're dead and you don't know it. Because the Holy Spirit is here tonight. It's here to meet your every need, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Now I want you to do the next thing. I want you to come. I want you to come across this ramp, and I want to just lay my hand on you and pray for you tonight. Then you can return to your seat. Everyone just move out tonight. Praise the Lord. Just stand right here. Everyone just move out. Come around this way, please. Around to my left. I want to pray for you. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Lord Jesus, use my brother as never before. Thank you, Jesus, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Sister, let him touch you tonight. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. God bless you. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for the little children, Jesus. Hallelujah. Sister, the joy of the Lord's all over you tonight. Why don't you please him? Say thank you, Jesus. I believe he's going to touch you right now. Say thank you, Jesus. Sister, in the name of Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Come on, praise him tonight. Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus. [speaks in tongues] Hallelujah, the Holy Ghost is alive tonight. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Sister, start to praise God. Hallelujah. Sister, even tonight. -[cries out] -Even tonight, may God use you in a great way. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah! That's it. Let the Holy Ghost work through you tonight. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus, Lord, use my brother. Quicken him tonight from head to soul, in Jesus' name. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, tonight. Bless the little child. Thank you, Jesus, for my young sister tonight. Lord, use her. That's another Holy Ghost movement. -[speaking in tongues] -Hallelujah. Let joy come into your life right now. Say thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah! Yes, Lord! Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Not by might or power but by my spirit, saith God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Sister, start to praise him. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, tonight. Hallelujah. In Jesus' name, Lord, let the work begin tonight. Praise the Lord! Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you for my sister tonight. Lord Jesus, use my sister.

What you want God to do for you? He's gonna do it right now. Hallelujah. Say thank you, Jesus. In Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. Come on. Praise him. Say thank you, Jesus. Thank You, Jesus, praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Use thy sister in a ministry as never before. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus, hallelujah. Well, praise the Lord. Hallelujah Even tonight, Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus, for the little child tonight. Thank you, Jesus. Praise the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Even tonight, Lord, let the work begin. Thank you, sweet Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus, for the victory tonight. Hallelujah. Thank you for my brother. Well, praise the Lord in Jesus' name! Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Come on, lift up your hands and praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Well, thank you Jesus! Yes, Lord! Hallelujah. In the name of Jesus. Glory, hallelujah! Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank you for victory tonight. -Right now! Say yes, Lord. In Jesus' name. Thank you, Jesus. Well, praise the Lord. [music playing] -Thank you, sweet Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Well, praise him! Yes! [music playing] MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): And I'd just like to encourage everybody to help Brother Marjoe tonight, and his efforts to help reach the teenagers, the narcotics, the young people in the highways and hedges. How many of you believe it's a worthy cause? Say amen. CONGREGATION (OFFSCREEN): Amen! MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): God bless you, Marjoe. -I want everyone to stand to your feet. Would you get out your checkbook tonight? Would some of you get out $5 or $10? Bring what you would for Jesus tonight. Come on. [music playing] CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): I really enjoyed that. I started in the same ministry you're in myself. It's been great. [music playing] CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): I saw you when you were a little boy. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): It's nice to see you. How you doing? God bless you. I appreciate it, sir. [music playing] -Thank you, God bless you. Thank you, God bless you. Thank you so much. Thank you. I appreciate that. Thank you, brother. How are you tonight? Nice to see you. CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): Keep it going. -I will, thank you. I appreciate that. [music playing] -Praise the Lord! Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. I just want to mention, I told you tonight about my testimony. I have a record album here that has recorded messages of when I was four, six, and eight years old. Now listen, if you don't have this, you should definitely get it. Because a lot of people, they say, what could a little child say? There's a message on here, "Hell With the Lid Off," that there's been literally thousands of people who've been saved by just hearing this message. This is a business, and you know, you don't get meetings or you don't get booked back unless you have a gimmick. Or as the evangelists say, it's a ministry. Like it's incredible. They'll say, oh, Brother So-and-so, he's got the ministry of laying on of hands, or he's got the ministry of prophecy, but that's a gimmick. And the guys that have the gimmicks get the big meetings and do good. And I mean, I used one time-- I had a thing where there's a special kind of ink you can buy, and you put it on. And with perspiration, when the salt starts to come out and you start to perspire, it will turn red. And so I painted a cross. You know, I just a cross like this on my head. And while I was preaching, the cross started to show. Immediately, people started nudging each other. And of course, it went away, I think, after a while. It only lasts so long, or it wipes away-- I don't remember. But afterwards, I mean, I had that whole audience at one of the biggest meetings that I've ever had, because they saw that cross. They said, oh, Brother Marjoe, when you were preaching tonight, the cross was over your head. I mean, that convinced them, you know, that it was really very, very real, and it made it very easy for me to take offerings and receive money. When I went out back on the circuit, I hadn't preached since, you know, I was 13 or 14 years old. But I sort of had to prove myself all over again. That's why my meetings have only really gotten good about the past year. And I know even though I dress what I was consider conservatively-- you know, comb my hair back, put on a suit and tie-- when I would go to a pastor's church where I hadn't preached before, they'd sort of look me over and wonder, you know, what was I really going to say? What was I really like? And I'd just sort of have to just cool it till I got up on the platform and they saw that I did say all the things they wanted to hear. And I just sort of had to put myself into really getting along with them, like I enjoy it. And well, the restaurants. God, the restaurants. You imagine what it's like to have to go out and eat at Frisch's Big Boy every night? You're my favorite church, you know? I have to tell you that of all the churches, you're my favorite church. -Well, you're really our favorite evangelist, but we don't want anybody to know it. [laughs] MARILYN BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): We don't want you to get a big head or anything. RUBY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, we want to keep you humble. -OK. Well, I been kept poor so far, so. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Know what-- you mentioned about Dallas. I was going to say, one thing I really like about coming to your church is the fact, you know, the way that you treat me and so honestly, and financially in my Youth Crusades. But one church that I went to in Dallas, they gave me a rough way to go. -Did they really? -It's amazing how many-- you know, some preachers out there, it's amazing. It's still-- RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): You should have raised your voice. [laughter] -There's so many preachers nowadays, though, that you can only have them, you know, once. And after that, you can't have them back, because they're not honest and they don't treat the people right, either, you know. And if they don't treat the people right, then the people won't back them up. RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Right, see, that's why we have you, Marjoe. RUBY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): That's one thing that we appreciate about your ministry. You've always blessed our people. You've been-- -Yeah, when you tell them something, they believe it. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, that's true. I think nowadays, people have seen so much, seen so much happen, they can tell one of these shysters when they come through. Because they've heard everything, you know? They'll listen a couple nights and they won't say anything, you know? But they can tell after a while. -Yeah, they're not dumb. You know, people are intelligent nowadays. They-- -There's one guy that gets into it so heavy that he prophesies. And he told me how he did it. I mean, he looked right across the table, back and forth, at me, and he told me how he confiscates money. He says he's on this station. There's over 40 states. And he'll go on there, and he'll get on the radio, and he'll say, I know that listening to my little voice tonight, that there's some lady out there and you've got $10 put away in a cookie jar. Now God spoke to my heart and told me to go and tell you to get that $10 and get it in the mail and send it to me, and God'll bless you. God'll give you a reward such as you've never known before. Then he comes back to me and tells me, he says, if you're on the radio and you're going over 40 states, and you're on at prime time, you've got thousands of people listening, the chances are that there are at least 200 or 300 little old ladies who've got a $10 bill in a cookie jar. And so if a couple hundred go bring it and send it to you, that's two grand that you've made, just like that. And so if you're going to get into big-time religion, this is the games you've got to play, things like that. You go into it as a business and you work it as a business, you know. RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Do you know, he prints over one million magazines a month? I mean, he sends out-- -I know he's got the biggest mailing list. RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): One million. He has one million names and addresses, and he sends them magazines out, free. -Yeah. In fact, if you want to get started, he even-- he sells names off his mailing list. He's got so many all over the country. I know some other preachers-- RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): I was talking to him. -Have bought mailing lists from him. RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): He's got over 100,000 names in Southern California. RUBY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Marjoe, do you want some of the melons and things here? RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Or in California. RUBY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Let Marilyn serve. MARILYN BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): My beautiful salad. -And I thought about getting that for the convention. I figured, have them print it, just sort of like, here's a magazine. Boy, they print that all on one sheet. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): You ought to see his presses. He's got a whole-- -I've seen them. He's got three big presses. Three big presses. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. And everyone makes it with their magazine. You send out your magazine. In the magazine you show pictures of what you're trying to do, and then you raise dollars for projects, mainly what you-- the projects you do, like, they raise money for missionary projects, say, to go to Haiti. But they'll take in tens of thousands of dollars of maybe only spend a few thousand. So you work that as a business. Then you follow up. From your magazine and your radio, you use to build and you go into one or two-night crusades in auditoriums. And the crusades, you don't plan. In the auditoriums, you don't make a lot of money from this, but it makes the personal contact. But the main money comes from the magazines and from the radio program, you know. But that's like a thing. You've got to stay in it all the time. It's like the ones who are successful, they're businessmen who are constantly-- they're like Madison Avenue PR men. -I want to go to Korea. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): When are you going to go there? RUBY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Why don't you come keep our church in October while we go to Brazil? -I might do that. -Then I can go. -OK. Really? -Mm-hm. RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I want her to go. - -I want to go too, though. [laughter] How much property do you have over there? RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Well, we bought 800 acres. -[whistles] RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): All jungle. -Have you developed any of it? RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. We've got about-- oh, I'd say-- -Anybody want some more salad? RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): We've got about 50 acres in cultivation. You know, rice, beans, corn. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah. I heard something-- what was that? Someone wanted to buy it? RAY BOATRIGHT (OFFSCREEN): Yes, there's a preacher wanted to buy it. We're building a Bible school, and he wants to-- -Then we got a deal with-- But want him in our project. -On with a big food company, you know, that makes cornflakes and stuff like that. Big mill. They want to buy a piece of it. MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Part of it? -Well, a piece of property that's about half. 'Cause I have a waterfall and a dam. [marjoe playing organ] -That's it! -Now down. (SINGING) Sins away. Now jump out. You mean the echo? Well, you know the place is-- -Well, not the echo, but you got all the noise. -When the place is filled with people, your echo goes way down. -Sure, sure. -Because it's much better. -Sure. See, we have a good thing. We'll probably get good audience sound here too, because the speakers don't reach as far. We can move the mics way back. -But the music, the song service-- record everything, man. -Yeah. -Because it's-- the music is incredible. -How big's the choir going to be? -How many seats are there? -Are they going to fill this? -Oh, yeah. Out of sight. [CHOIR SINGING - "WE'VE COME TOO FAR TO TURN AROUND"] -There's a little thing that she does that you gotta be ready for. She'll-- testing, one. She'll go, tssshhewww. Tsshheeww. ALLIE TAYLOR (OFFSCREEN): Tsshew. Come on. And then think about the word that said everything. -Just like, tsssheww, can't you feel the presence? Tsshewww. Feel good. Tsshewww. She keeps doing that. Yeah, she plays that. -It's like the sound you hear when you're on acid. Tsshew. [laughter] -She's heavy into acid, Sister Taylor. [MUSIC PLAYING AND PEOPLE CLAPPING] ALLIE TAYLOR (OFFSCREEN): Ohhh, yes! We're gonna let-- we're gonna let you hear a real testimony this morning, if we can bring the audience down to Earth again long enough to hear this testimony. Oh, bless the Lord. Thank you, Jesus. That's what we come here for, is to worship God. We don't come to put on a fashion show. This is a general love offering, an expense offering, for the Lighthouse Church budget. We do have a heavy budget. And we don't use God's money for foolishness. We just don't. Now I said, Lord, it would be so nice, but I don't ask for it. I just thought about it. But somehow I believe, Sister Green, I've got his favor. A lady who hasn't seen me in 25 years wrote me a letter and said, Sister Taylor, I have promised God I'm giving Allie Taylor a whole acre of commercial property, right on the highway, 20 miles from Tampa. Right close to the Sun City, St. Petersburg. I'm going to give you a chance because the Lord's been talking to me to prove God this morning again. I have some slips made out. This says, help me prove God for these blessings. Now these are not for everybody. These are for a special few. These are for people that are going to sacrifice maybe some bills they need to pay. Or maybe it's that dress they needed to buy. Or maybe it's that fall coat that you've been laying away a little money on. But this morning you feel like it's time for you to prove God and make a sacrifice. Don't you come up here for this unless you've made a sacrifice. Now everything you give to God's not a sacrifice. It's your reasonable service to give every dime you can to the Lord. But when you take something that hurts, like I've done down through the years and many of you have done, and give to God, God will give you this morning what you stand before me for. For he spoke to me to do this. While they're coming, if you have a Prove Me offering, I want you to fill out one of these slips. And then you're going to get in the other side and line up till I get there. Don't put it in the basket over there. Don't put an offering in the basket over there till I get there. Everybody march for this great general offering this morning. Get in this line if you have a Prove Me offering. Line up over there. Oh, yes, Jesus. The sacrifice offering is on your left this morning. Just get in line. [MUSIC - "LORD, TAKE ME THROUGH"] -Now I want to ask you some questions. And if the answer is yes, he can, I want you to yell it back at me as loud as you can. Let's try it one time. Let me hear you say, yes he can! CONGREGATION: Yes he can! -Oh, you can say it better than that. Say it again. CONGREGATION: Yes he can! -All right, listen to the question now. Can God deliver a dope addict? CONGREGATION: Yes he can! -Can God deliver an alcoholic? CONGREGATION (OFFSCREEN): Yes he can! -Can God deliver a homosexual? CONGREGATION: Yes he can! -Can God heal the sick? CONGREGATION: Yes he can! -Can God deliver now? CONGREGATION: Yes he can! -Say it again. Say now! CONGREGATION: Now! MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Lift up your hands and praise him. Hallelujah. My God shall supply all! My God shall supply all! He shall supply all! All my need! All my need! All my need! That means all, brother, all! When you're down on the ground, when you're up against the wall, when you're low-down and oppressed, my God shall supply all! All! All! All! All! All my need! Thank you, Jesus. Oh, praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord. Oh, I feel a tingle in my bosom. Hallelujah! I feel a chill going up and down my spine, because I know that there's hope. I said, I know that there is hope. Can you praise the Lord? Thank you, Jesus. There is hope. [MUSIC - "I'M ON MY WAY TO HEAVEN"] -At least, you know, as screwed up as it is, they get into it a little bit. And I have to admire them for that. I mean, if I was going to pick a religion, you know, a Christian-type religion, that I had to go into one of them-- I mean, thank God I don't have to. If I had to go into one of them, I would pick the Pentecostal faith. Because some of the churches, the music is just great. And the people are interesting, you know, they're kind of weird. And it's OK. For the church things, it's a little farther out. Glory je to Beezus. -I worked with $0.75 an hour with a pick and shovel and I preached on Sundays and pastored a church. And I said because I was faithful, God's now given me a Cadillac, hallelujah. And I said, I'll tell you something else. God would have something wrong with him if we didn't, because Jesus Christ himself said that no man hath forsaken houses or lands or fathers or mothers or brothers or friends except that he'll get a hundred-fold more in this life and in the life to come, eternal life! Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus. Praise God. He said he'd do it, and if he didn't do it, there'd be something wrong with God's word. I said, now I'm driving a Cadillac. Why don't you do it? Hallelujah! Oh, Jesus was real. How many say amen? CONGREGATION (OFFSCREEN): Amen! -And you know, I got to thinking about that all day long, and I'd been trying to trade for a Chevrolet, and I couldn't get a Chevy. I tried to trade for a Buick, and I couldn't get a Buick. And I said, bless God. The more I think about that, the more I think I was preaching the truth. I went down to the Cadillac agency and one hour later, I drove out a new Cadillac. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord! Thank you, Jesus. [applause] PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): I said this. I said, son, you know I got some little kids-- well, they're not so little anymore. They're grown up. And I said whenever I get ready to go and I'm not going to be around any longer, who do you think I'm going to leave my things to? I'm not going to give them to somebody that I don't know. I'm going to leave them to my kids. And that's what my daddy did. CONGREGATION: Hallelujah. PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): That's what my daddy did. Hallelujah! Father created these things for his people, if they'll use them right. Bless God, I'm gonna drive that Cadillac down here and get it dusty and dirty and use it for God! Hallelujah! Thank you, Jesus! [MUSIC - "SINCE I LAID MY BURDENS DOWN (GLORY, GLORY)"] PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): Reverend Vernon Gortner is with us tonight, who is the father of Marjoe. And through the years, he talked and trained and prayed that the Holy Ghost would always anoint this young man. And we're so happy to have the father, also, of Reverend Marjoe here with us tonight, and I'm going to ask him to introduce him. I'm so thankful that we have men of this caliber, and I think we ought to give them both a great big hand this evening! God bless you as you come. [applause] -Thank you very much. It's a real privilege to be here tonight. I'd like to say a word about Marjoe before I introduce him. He's the fourth generation of preachers. His great-grandfather, my grandfather, was one of the first missionaries that went to Liberia, West Africa, with Bishop Taylor of the Methodist Episcopal Church. He died and was buried there. My father began to preach the gospel when he was just a young man, 16 years of age, and I began to preach the gospel when I was about 19 years of age. But Marjoe began to preach the gospel when he was only four years of age. I remember when Marjoe was just five years old, when he received the infilling of the Holy Spirit. PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah. VERNON GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Did you ever see anybody receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost when they were taking a bath? [laughter] VERNON GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Well, that's what Marjoe was doing. He was in the bathtub, take a bath. And I heard some noise going on in there, and I looked in, and there he was with his hands up, praising the Lord and speaking in heavenly languages, PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah! VERNON GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): In tongues that he knew nothing about. [applause] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): See, we've never had a father/son type relationship, because he won't talk about the time when I was a child. So our relationship is completely lot of void, then, because when we see each other, we're, like, walking on needles, you know? And we have nothing really to say to each other. We talk about his trees and his yard and different things, but there's no communication at all. If I were God, I would send every man, woman, boy, or girl, pastor, preacher, every person who professed salvation but yet didn't have a burning desire to win souls-- I would send them to hell. Oh, yes I would. And I would let them remain among that sea of lost humanity until they had a burning desire to win souls to the Lord Jesus Christ. Hallelujah! What if the vast number of Christians right in our own community would just sow the precious seed of God's word to those right around them? Was it not the wise man Solomon that said, cast thy bread upon the water, for thou shalt find it after many days. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah! Oh, hallelujah! Brother, what do you suppose Solomon meant by that? Take a loaf of Wonder Bread and Hostess Twinkies and throw it in the Mississippi, and after a few months, find it in the Gulf of Mexico? No, sir, I don't think so. If I had gotten into evangelism heavily, I would have probably, like, maybe been a rock singer. Because I enjoy moving on stage, working a microphone. And I watch certain rock performers perform, and a lot of things I do, you know, I've copied off of them or gotten in. You know, like Mick Jagger-- certain things that I do, I sort of do like a waist-hunching thing that he does sometimes. Lift up your hands and praise the Lord! We've got to watch out for these professional shouters-- can you say amen? Some people, I tell you, the minute the music starts, anyone that's in the Spirit, you better watch out. Because they gotta do the boogaloo or they gotta do the frug. They got their own little thing. That's not the spirit, man, that's carnal! Come on. Hallelujah! You're not liking this, but I'm telling you the truth, and you know it. It all comes down to-- do you know who Jesus really is? I said, do you know who Jesus really is? His name shall be call Emmanuel, meaning God with us. Think about that. He Was divinity, but he put on humanity. Why did he pray? He prayed because he was human! But brother, sister, he answers prayer because he is divine. Oh, why did he rest? He took rest because he was human. Oh, but he gives us rest because he is divine. Why did he thirst? He was thirsty because he was human. But he satisfies our thirst because he is divine. Why did he sleep? He slept because he was human. But he gives us rest because he is divine. CONGREGANT (OFFSCREEN): Amen! -He took part of human nature so that we might take part of his divine nature. He became poor so that we might become rich. He bore a cross so that we might wear a crown. He lived in a manger so that we might live in a mansion. Do you know who Jesus really is? Lift up your hands and praise the Lord. Hallelujah. Oh, hallelujah. Hallelujah, praise him tonight. [CONGREGATION MOANING AND SPEAKING IN TONGUES] -Lift up your hands and praise him tonight. Worship him tonight. Oh, is there any holes in your net tonight? Let Jesus fix it for you! Let Jesus fix it for you! Oh, let your prayer to heaven be, Lord, Lord, make me a soul-winner. Lord, that you will use me. Lord, that you will use me in some way. Lord, let me be a soul-winner for your work. Not my will, but thy will be done. [CONGREGATION MOANING AND SPEAKING IN TONGUES] -Hallelujah. Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. [CONGREGATION MOANING AND SPEAKING IN TONGUES] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): I want every head bowed and ever eye closed. Hallelujah. I just want to see the hands tonight. Could you play that song, "He Touched Me"? I can't get up and say to them, OK, now listen, if you just believe this afternoon-- I mean, it's all got to be done under the thing of Jesus. Which even that's OK. Like the Jesus thing I would leave, but they still-- I've got to put in that thing, like if you don't come down, you're going to go to hell and you're going to burn and you've got to go into the sin thing. It's the-- the way that I have to do it. If I could just do, like, the faith number, and get up, say, OK everybody, let's really get loose this afternoon and get off and get rid of all our hangups and have nice group therapy, that would be great. But you can't do it that way. It's got to all be done under this facade of holiness. [MUSIC - "HE TOUCHED ME AND MADE ME WHOLE"] -Sing it again tonight. [MUSIC - "HE TOUCHED ME AND MADE ME WHOLE"] -Sister, come right down here. -I have a condition in my stomach, that everything I eat and drink, it just goes to acid. -Do you believe that the Lord's going to do it tonight? -Yes. -Do you believe he's going to touch this condition? -Yes. -Say yes, Lord. -Yes, Lord. -Say thank you, Jesus. -Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. -In the name of Jesus. In the name of Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Hallelujah, praise God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. Hallelujah. What's God going to do for you? -[inaudible]. -That's very serious. But do you have faith tonight? -Yes. -I've seen you every since I've been here. I believe you've got faith. Do you believe that with me? -Yes, I do. -All right, lift up your hands. Say thank you, Jesus. -Thank you, Jesus. -Thank you, Jesus. Say it again. -Thank you, Jesus. -In the name of Jesus! Sister, tonight is going to be your night. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): God-- SARAH KERNOCHAN (OFFSCREEN): Do it, do it. -God is going to-- [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): You're spoiling the mood! [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): God is going to do something for you. Then I'll turn around to the crowd, and I'll say to everyone, do you believe it? And you know, everyone-- say yes! I said, that's not enough. If there's no faith here tonight, I can't do anything. You've got to believe it. And I go, do you believe it? And by this time, the crowd's going, yes! And I'll say, Sister, if I lay my hands on you, it's going to happen. By this time, you're just like this. Because I do a whole thing on you. Then I sort of like get down to, now I'm going to pray the prayer, and everyone bow your heads. And all of a sudden, I go, in the name of Jesus! [laughter] -And you know, this time, if the shock doesn't get you-- How do you feel? Whoa, hallelujah. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah! This is God! Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus. Oh, hallelujah! PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah! MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Oh, praise the Lord! Hallelujah! PREACHER (OFFSCREEN): Hallelujah. -Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Come on, lift up your hands and praise the Lord. Hallelujah, thank you, Jesus. And then once you get one or two-- once you get one or two, they really come off and say, yeah, I really felt that I had a bad back, I had a bad leg. Then there's a whole slew that say, oh, yeah, I feel better too. Because like 97% of it's psychosomatic. SARAH KERNOCHAN (OFFSCREEN): I feel better. -Yeah. Yeah. [laughter] [SINGING - "O, HOW I LOVE JESUS"] -In the name of Jesus, let the work be done, hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. [SINGING - "O, HOW I LOVE JESUS"] [SINGING - "O, HOW I LOVE JESUS"] Do you love him tonight? Then sing it like you mean it! [SINGING - "O, HOW I LOVE JESUS"] One more time, sing it again tonight. [SINGING - "O, HOW I LOVE JESUS"] Well, praise the Lord. -Tremendous. Tremendous. He's a born preacher. He's a-- he's a boy-- he's just a preaching machine, witnessing the miracle of God. Hand of God upon him, no question about it. You've got to give the Lord all the credit and the glory. It's the Lord Jesus Christ. -Just blinking in and out of the two lives, it's-- I just don't want to do it anymore. What can I say? At times I feel like I should get up and do repentance to the audience or something, you know? Like I have these fantasies, a lot of times, I go through, like I'd really like to get up and just tell them what I really think, or where I'm really at, what I'd like them to do. Then when I get up, I go right into my sermon. But things like this relieve my head at the time, but I've been playing with that now for a couple of years, and I just can't go on doing it like that anymore. I made my decision that I was going to get out. I don't know. Actually, I've been making it for two years. But then meeting after meeting comes along, and I just seem to like-- I don't know, you get uptight financially and I have to go back. But the movie or no movie, I'd definitely have to get out, because I'm at a point, like I said, where I either have to make the decision to go on and really do it all the way, or else get out. And I know I have to get out, so I'm-- guess you could say I'm on my last meetings right now, my last leg, so to speak. Enjoy getting it off on stage, but I really wish I was getting it off as a rock star or an actor or something, which I have to get into. I think, you know, some people will probably think that maybe I'm an evil person. I sort of like to think that I'm bad, but not evil. Well, I am a hype, but I don't feel that I'm really a bad hype. I don't know, there's kind of a fine-- there's a difference. To me, there's a difference. But for me to stay in it at this point, I would have to say, you know, just screw it all. I'm going to do it the very best. I'd have to drop all the good things that I do say in some of my sermons, few good things. But I kind of feel that maybe some of the things that I've done, preaching the last-- not as a child. As a child, I'm not responsible for it, I feel. But I still do feel, though, that that whole psychological thing when I was a child had a heavy influence, of course, on me. I would never have gone back the last two years had it not been for the childhood. But still, I was in adult or sort of a grown person when I went back into it, so I'm responsible for that. And so maybe that's bad, you know? Maybe that's bad. But you know, my going back into it, and obviously saying things I don't believe-- anyone that does that is kind of bad, maybe. But then, you know, a lot of people do bad things. I haven't been together with Agnes that long. A couple of months. But oh, it's just such an incredible relief to be able to feel that you can trust someone. When I first met Marjoe, the first thing he did was take me to this house, show me his book and all his clippings, and play his record. And from about 2:30 in the morning till 8 o'clock in the morning, he just kept telling me and telling me everything. And it was so heavy, I was, like, drained. I just said, whew, boy, this is really a trip. And I couldn't believe that he was this guy who I thought was really nice and sane and sweet and everything good, who had been through this crazy trip when he was a kid. And he wasn't crazy. You know, I thought this couldn't be the same person. But here were all these pictures and all these clippings, and it's him, all right. And it's still a little bit hard to believe. Even though now I see him preaching-- he's like two different people. Every time I watch him, it's like I'm really watching a play. It's not something that's real. I'm just watching a performance of an actor who goes home and lives a totally different life. I feel that everybody around me feels the same way in a congregation. I don't know all this Jesus business. I mean, I just find it hard to believe that they believe it, too. JOHN BINDER (OFFSCREEN): Do you think Marjoe's a con man? -Con man? Tsk. John. -What can I say? I think religion is-- it's a drug. [laughs] It's addicting. Can God deliver a religion addict? [laughs] Can God deliver a dog? Oh yes he can! [laughter] -Can God deliver a little black lovey like this? Oh yes he can. -Oh yes he can. -But folks, tonight, this little dog needs your prayers. I want someone in the congregation to help me out. Sister, would you come here? Lay hands on this dog. The Bible says, they lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. And tonight this little dog it's going to be touched. Oh, I feel it. In the name-- in the name of Jesus, you little dog. [laughter] -[kiss] Goodbye. [laughter] MARJOE GORTNER (OFFSCREEN): Baby. Don't be scared, baby. -Poor little baby. -Poor little thing. See, he's got the Holy Ghost. He's much better. Holy Ghost. This dog wasn't walking like this before. Notice the way he staggers now? [laughter] -He's truly delivered. Look at him, he's touched. He's made-- miracle, miracle! Look what God has done! Hallelujah, it's a miracle! God's delivered the little dog! Look at this little dog! He came in a wheelchair. Now he's leaving-- come on, little dog! Show the folks! Folks, this is it. See what God has done. There it is, living proof. It's happened before your very eyes. God has done a miracle. God is in this place tonight. God has worked through his servant and done something wonderful again. -Oh! -Now I want you to get out your dollars and we're going to give money tonight to kill a Commie for Jesus. We're going to fight Communism so that little dogs like this can be set free. -Where's my wallet? -Everyone, get out your money. Come on, get it out. Oh! [laughter] -Hallelu! I feel good. [panting] Hallelujah! [SINGING - "I'VE GOT CONFIDENCE"] -And now, whoever you are, wherever you are, may God bless you, and you, and you. THEME SONG: He had barely learned to walk when they taught him how to pray, mm-hm, mm-hm. Barely learned to walk when they taught him how to pray, mm-hm, mm-hm. But they never said who he was praying to, so don't pay it any mind. Just put on a good show. The Lord'll never know if I'm pocketing a handful of dimes. Lord, Lord, everybody have a good time. 'Cause he's gonna save all, all my brothers. He'll save all my sisters. He's gonna save all the people and give them God's love. Well, he never made a deal with the devil anyway, mm-hm. Never made a deal with Jesus anyway, mm-hm. No one could say he wasn't any good or that he couldn't play the part. All the people around him kneeling on the ground, God rejoicing in their heart. Oh, Lord. God rejoicing in their heart. 'Cause he's gonna save, save, all my brothers. He'll save all my sisters. He's gonna save all the people and give them God's love. So we'll gather by the river where the grace of God flows, mm-hm. Gather by the river where the grace of God goes, mm-hm. Who wins out? Nobody knows. Don't pay it any mind. Stay away from hell, watch your step in heaven, everybody have a good time. Lord, Lord, everybody have a good time 'Cause he's gonna save, save, all my brothers, and he'll save all my sisters. He's gonna save all the people and give them God's love.
