It might sound mean, but some children should not be allowed to grow up. That is to say, grow up without restrictions. Keep them in line early on, like good students, guided by benign administrators, such as found in the Deposits and Consignments Fund, where they will flourish without threatening the planet. Left unchecked, these little ones soon turn cranky, nasty, aggressive, and, ultimately, invasive! Thank God, sooner or later these types slip on a banana peel, to everyone's relief. Here, in my opinion, is the banana peel on which Adolf Hitler will finally slide. Attention enthusiasts! JUNE 1940 Champagne! To our Fuhrer! General, a French soldier who did not retreat continues to shoot at us. Impossible! - Clovis! - Yes? Fall back, for the love of God! Come on! Your doing more than needed puts the regiment at risk. They were taking a time out. MARCH 1941 Well, well! The Germans are going to put order back into this country. Long live Petain! Bastard! You will see! So I hit him! No, hitting him was too much! "Time will tell" would have sufficed. You always do more than is asked of you! Clovis, keep your cool with the occupier, for the love of God! - What? - Do you have any-- No! He praised Petain. So what? "Long live Petain" is no reason to slap him. Could you hide me for six weeks? Two months? Where am I going to hide you? In a fridge? Yes, good, let me know. - Would you happen to have-- - No. A train in the evening? Okay. No hitting anyone for now, especially collaborators. Why not? They are more German than the Germans. I promise, Commander. "Promise." No! So, you are off to Paris? Yes. How much do I owe you? If you go, nothing. It's our way of showing appreciation. Thank you. - What was that about? - Clovis. What's going on? The war might be over for us. Clovis is leaving. - He's leaving? - Yes. No more need to buy glasses, repair the percolator, chairs and billiard cues. Peace! Where is he off to? To Paris. It's a lost cause if Paris isn't open. - I was expecting you. - What's new, General? - We fear a German landing in England. - What? Called "Operation Lady Marlène". We need to find out everything about it. It doesn't make sense. Had the Germans wanted to land there, they would have used the stage at Dunkirk. They could have infiltrated the returning English troops. No one would have noticed. It's not about knowing why they didn't do it, but where, when and how they intend to. Yes, General. - Hello Dutaillis. - Hello Commander. Wow, it's filling up! It's filling, but slowly. I am doing what I can, General. Tomorrow you'll have what you need. - -Montreuil and Maisons- - Alfort? - No, they're petitioning there. Cowards! They're not cowards, they went three days unable to cook. - Cook what, may I ask? - Artichokes, General. Less nourishing but tastier when cooked. As for the gas, they can't know you are London-bound. As far as we're concerned, a certain Kramer, Franz Kramer, in charge of radio links, leaves today for Berlin. - Good-bye, Darling. - Good-bye, Anita. When is the wedding, Miss Georgette? In 15 days. I will have returned... with a present. Thank you, Mr. Kramer. - Good-bye, Mr. Kramer. - Good-bye. We believe this departure has to do with Operation Lady Marlène. We also believe that Kramer will be absent for about 15 days. We must search his pockets upon his getting off the train. If Germany invades England, we have 100 years of occupation ahead. I am off to the hairdresser, Miss. Fine, but make it quick. Weren't we expecting Mr Paulo? My brother? He'll be by. There was no alert yesterday, but this evening with the good weather... They're lost or they have run out of juice. That would be too bad. Anyway... What I did I tell you, with this good weather... Yes, well... Hurry! Yes, Captain! - Are you the janitor? - Yes. Janitor or not, you can't stay here. - Bombs! - Really? Take shelter like everyone else. Meanwhile, I'll see how things are upstairs. My jam was stolen! - Hello, Marthe. - Paulo! So, the rabbit is still alive and kicking? Yes, thanks to you! My goodness! Good weather, I presume. That's too much. This isn't all for you. Three jars are for Mrs. Clain, two for Simone's kid and the pate for Irene, the policeman's wife. She'll come by in the morning, if she can stand on her crutches. That poor woman! He said that, as a cop, he can't buy on the black market. You find idiots everywhere. Bye and take it easy with all that food. Be careful. Getting stopped with that. That's for sure. - So Paulo, my ham? - I can't find any. The first one found is for me, whatever the price. Silk stockings interest you? I am warm enough with wool socks. - Too bad. Good-bye, Paulo. - Good-bye, Commissioner. Help this man, he might be foreign. Careful, the gun might be loaded. They're still at war, these guys. Gently, you guys. Armed as he is, the station could blow. We're sorry. - What's going on? - I've taken a prisoner. Thank you very much. This brave European soldier thanks you. I can help him get off too. Yes! If they bother you, you should have done your duty when needed. As says our dear Marshal. - What the--! - Fuck! German police. What's going on? This man wished to help your comrade soldier board seeing that he is a soldier of Europe, and this Gaullist here slapped him. - What? - That's about it. Is that how you saw it? Absolutely! Indeed, and even at one point he said: "Marshal Petain is an asshole!" - Yup. - Yup. And Hitler too. That's right. And Mussolini too. It's not true, I never said that. It was I who-- Quiet! You will both get off to explain! Out! Hey, you have my suitcase! - Your suitcase? - That's mine! - Get on! - Ah yes! It's my suitcase. Thank you! - Give me your suitcase. - It's okay, let's go! - Bars of gold, have you? - Just about. - Where were you going? - To a fish market in Asnières. They'd have picked you out. - Maybe, but I'm expected there. - You'll telephone them. Listen here, I should warn you: the bistro where I am taking you is a military establishment. Like a canteen, then. That's right, a canteen. Military? Surely you didn't expect to see our troops from 1914? They still need to eat, right? And do you see that? Look! Only officers. - Let off a bomb here and the war is over. - You said it. I will carry my suitcase and find you later at the bar. Gentlemen. Come! Mr. Paulo! Hello everyone! Is Kramer here? I have the pate he asked for. He's gone for 15 days. No big deal. Empty this and put it on my account. I am with a friend. We're going to eat. Yes, of course. - My house was full to the brim. - Obviously! - Everything's in order. - Shh! Butter, milk, eggs... I told my sharecropper: "Where do I put it all?" Of course. Stockpiling is not our thing here. It's the same with my hunts. Wild game is proliferating since the armistice began. Why is that? All the poachers in the region are prisoners in Germany. - How amusing! - Indeed. - Your table is ready, Ladies. - Perfect. - That can't be! - I'm afraid it is. Spit on food while others-- If you would like to eat, it's time. Let's have a drink at a table. Miss, have we not met somewhere before? I doubt it. Did we ask you to speak? I doubt that you have met this young lady. Oh yes, why? She never goes to the country. We'll see if there is a can of sardines at the house. You will sleep on the couch and go to the fish market in the morning. You would never get there now before the curfew. - Engaged to that idiot. - She didn't know you were coming. All that to open your door? - I lost my key. - I see. Nice place you have. I had a bigger place when I was married that wasn't worth keeping. Did she die? Not for everyone, the bitch! Put down your suitcase. My brother being in Africa, I'm here at his place. He's somewhat like you. When we disagreed, Bang! - Oh yes? What does he do? - He's a missionary. Really? Well, he's on to something. In that job, defeating the devil is everything. - Do I look like a missionary? - I mean, types like you are pure. You're for Country, and he for the Good Lord. - What do you do in life? - I'm an electrician in Vienne. You? - Commerce. - I see. - Buying? Sales? - Mostly sales. - What do you want? - Can't you read? - Floor inspection. Buckets, sand bags. - I'll come with you. You stay here. We simply-- - Your tenants evacuate during drills? - Right away. Especially the Germans! One on the third is down in no time. They have orders to evacuate immediately, officers too. That's great. Where are the stairs? - At the back, to the right. - Thanks. - Tell me. - Yes? Are you from around here? The district chief-- What's that? "District Chief"? Clearly... we, all the neighborhoods, all the districts... We do all the rounds. - My boss is tops. - That's it. That's great. Let's go! My flashlight. Hurry! Hurry! Let's get a move on! Never go all the way to the fifth floor. There's no time to go down if the drill is short. You see? You see what people can stash? Oh yes, it's not honest. Finding a place for edible nests won't be easy. Disgraceful, leaving a dog while under fire! What are you doing? - The Kraut lives there. - So what? - We're not going! - And why not? - We'll be shot. - Give me the keys if you're afraid! - Absolutely not! - -You're pro- - German! Not at all. Nothing like that. - Enter! - All right. - Hello, Madame. - Hello, young man. You are not going down? With this? Who will stop me? - Yes, of course. - So, let's go. - Where? - To the cellar, of course! That's why you're here, right? No, I mean, we are not here to, no... - Yes! - Yes? Yes. Okay, then, take a hold of it here, and your grandson, from here. Get in front. Be careful. There, are you happy? This way, we'll have made our mark. I forgot to close the door. Leave it. We don't have the time to go back up. Let's go. Let's get out of here! FISHMONGER - MOULINOT You're better off here at Mr. Paulo's, than hiding at my place. This fool, thinking he can hit a collaborator! - It's not outlawed. - Of course not. Better that than the opposite, you agree? What do you mean? I mean... better a patriot hit a collaborator than a collaborator hit a patriot. True. Even better would be to crush without hitting. But let's not forget that we're French and that the war isn't over. Why would you want for it to continue? A friend was scooped up for carrying an oyster knife. He attacked Germans with that? He planned to sell it as there are no more oysters. Soon, they'll ban the cheese knife. The only dangerous thing left will be supple knitting needles. The Resistance is getting organized. - The English-- - They're hypocrites. Don't exaggerate! Since Joan of Arc-- Unchanged! Dogs don't make cats! As for the Resistance, what a joke! We only know it exists because the General talks about it from the London radio. Do you know any members of the Resistance? Even if we did know about it, let me give you a piece of advice: don't get involved. I would even advise you to avoid anyone who is. Because friends of friends being friends, if your neighbour dallies in it, when the Germans come for him, they'll take you too. Nevertheless, you're hiding Clovis who hit a collaborator. Clovis hits whoever comes his way. Put him in a kitchen, the cook is ruined. If anyone asks me to join the Resistance, I'm in. - Right. That would end the Resistance. - Why? With the mess you leave wherever you go, in ten minutes, they will shoot all networks and de Gaulle. Anyway, Mr. Moulinot, I have to go now. - Clovis tells me you're in commerce? - He told you? - I only said you worked in commerce. - Yes! By the way, we are going to try out a new system, to please him. Because, before, he did door-to-door, but there was the risk... Enough. - Whereas now-- - It will be town-to-town. - How long still? - Three kilometers. - Didn't you see the sign? - What? It might be tiring to visit farms, but it's honest work compared to stealing. I'm not stealing, I'm redistributing. I take from those who have too much to give to those who do not have the means to have enough. What do you sell at your sister's place? My commission. You think farmers are going to sell their eggs without a profit? It's only fair. It's the fruit of their labor. "Their labor"! - They don't lay the eggs. - That's not the point. Buying for a reasonable price lets you resell for a reasonable profit, and with a clear conscience. It's after the hill, after the turn, according to the map. - Why this forgotten farm? - That's the point! Parisians hardly ever go there. It will cost less. Hello, Gentlemen. Where are you off to? We're in search of a bit of food. Are you merchants? Do you have authorization? I say this because without authorization, it's the black market. Well, that's not us because we have a conscience. We would not have covered 100 km, over hills, to engage in dishonest activities. We could have just stayed in Paris. One has to have an authorization to buy food for rabbits? It's food for rabbits that you're after? Yes. - Grass, for instance. - That's it. In the 100 km you've covered, you haven't seen a blade? - Well-- - I didn't notice anything. Well, then, since it's rabbit food that you're after, off you go. - Good-bye, Corporal. - Good-bye. - Hello, Ma'am. - Hello, Ma'am. - Are you here to buy? - Yes. You'll find my husband in the stable over there. Hello, Sir. Hello, Sir. - You've come from Paris? - Yes. - Cow dung doesn't bother you? - Not at all! Parisians used to hold their noses, saying it stinks. I always liked the smell. You too, eh, Paulo? Let's stay put then. Are you here to buy? - Yes. - I have nothing for you. - We're only here for eggs. - I don't have any! - Yet, with all these chickens... - They don't lay eggs! They have to know, let's say. Meaning? That the people for whom they lay eggs are able to pay. That's normal. They can't lay eggs for nothing. - And while singing. - We pay. Good. That'll be 200. No less than 200 eggs? We're not buying 200 eggs. Not 200 eggs, 200 francs! It's 200 francs for 200 eggs? - Per egg. - What's that? Two hundred francs per egg. Two hundred francs per egg? Wow, for that price they must sing for an orchestra. Please be reasonable! He has four kids, a sick wife. Isn't that right, Uncle? Yes, and then there's Mother... Two hundred francs. That's dishonest! And the poor who cannot pay: must they die of hunger? They can raise chickens, then they would have eggs! Your chickens... How much apiece? Ten thousand francs. Paulo, go wait at the bicycle. I will explain the situation to Mr. Farmer. Fine. But no, we weren't being dishonest. Just less honest than planned, that's all. Jeanne! Jeanne! Jeanne. Stop, I need to pee. Couldn't we have settled for a cow? Well, well, they really spoil their rabbits! Better to give it all to the cops than go to jail. This way, at least, we have a clear conscience. I don't understand. Is there an explanation, at least? You cough like that every time we come here. It's the bad air of the driveway. There he is! General, I apologize for coming back, but it's strange that during hours of distribution North Champigny has gas, and South Champigny has none. My colleague noticed it. - Gas is in enemy hands. - This is no time for kidding. The Paris gas line passes through your property. - Why can't anyone enter your hangar? - Enter my hangar? I defended the entrance to Vesoul against 100 Bavarian men. I'm not letting you into my hangar. All right. We'll see about this later. I'm in the Northern half, I don't care. You can't smoke here! Get out! What's that? We're outside. Outside is over there, in the street. And long live de Gaulle! I'm sure that he's up to something. - That crazy nut, up to something? - Half-crazy. - He wasn't crazy before the armistice. - That's just it! An armistice can shake up a General. The one in London can't recover. Hitler's a goner! Hitler's a goner! He's crazy, you mustn't... I know. We have the same in Germany. One day, your General will create some problems. - Bye. - Bye. - Anything new, General? - Yes. It's confirmed: Kramer will be back tomorrow at 5 p.m. He will have finished his trip by car and go to his apartment. We can't make a move during the journey as Kramer will not be alone. We'll make our move when he's alone at home, and do it with the utmost discretion. Unfortunately, General, there's only one solution: kill Kramer, take the documents and run. With the risk of retaliation that such an event would trigger. Hostage-takings and all the rest. - If you have a better idea-- - No, I don't. Moulinot, is it worth blowing up the department at this point? - I apologize, General. - Right. As for you, fill this by tomorrow night. By hook or by crook. I will bring the documents. I need more of the stuff to finish the job, yet the Germans steer me clear of it. I'm not interested. Gentlemen, do what you need to do. General. "Allocate." Easy enough to say! Trespassing on someone's property to steal their canned goods is theft and break-and-enter. Commander, since we give nearly everything we take to those without means. The police are there to crack down on the black market. The police... I heard that one of the officers who took our chickens could afford to smoke for a month. Okay, but even so! Do you want some pate from the Landes? Pate procured from a break-in? Never! Next time, I'll bring back Westphalia ham. They often bring it back from their leaves. Who's "They"? The Germans, of course. You also steal from the Germans? The finest buildings have apartments assigned to them. And in case of an alarm, Germans always go first. Above all, the officers. So, you think... We need to provoke a Paris-wide alert to get Kramer down to the cellar. Exactly, General. - Are you sure about Clovis? - Absolutely, General. Okay. I will send a message to Chambolard Mazu in London. WORWOOD - ENGLAND It's deafening, wouldn't you say? Yes. And all for what? Henri the joker claims the Germans are going to land, or something like that. Land? Where? In England, my dear. Isn't it a little too late? I have no faith in this story that the French hope to get their hands on the Kramer documents. If I may, I-- We will not sacrifice members of the Royal Air Force by having them fly over Paris at 5 p.m. Kramer will have to descend to the cellar, and his apartment will be burgled. Stupid. Murdering a German officer will result in serious reprisals, which we wish to avoid. So I thought-- Never. You're on your own. Hey, watch it! - Another cup? - With pleasure. No more space, thank you. We will parachute this evening into the Parisian region the most brilliant subject of the Intelligence Service: Lieutenant Simson. An alert over Paris? But why me? It is what it is. End of story. - What, with that? - Yes. We won't even manage one way! What are those two bombs for? If arriving over Paris early, fly over the powder magazine of Vincennes first. Who will be my gunner? - Sansonnet. - Oh no! Not Sansonnet! Sansonnet is not a gunner! As a civilian, he's a tailor. - I fail to see the link. - Exactly. No link between a gunner and Sansonnet. - Dubois. - Yes? Sansonnet chose to leave his shop to participate, like you, in the effort. But no! He chose nothing! Like me, they took him on at Dunkirk and won't let him loose. He's useless, as short-sighted as a mole. He'll shoot me in a flurry of gunfire. No one wants anything to do with him. In Rouen, the Germans will send him back to win the war in peace. That's him. When someone bangs into something, that's Sansonnet. I broke my glasses. So, they brought you up to speed? Your phony commander and the others. Yes, and I am proud of it! What time is it? Four o'clock. In one hour, I will have Europe's destiny in my hands. - And a bullet in your head. - That's what you think! You will owe me the freedom that's coming. And it will happen in silence and free of damage. Two French aces are taking off from England for Paris. The alert is in one hour, then it will be my turn! What's the role of your fishmonger, apart from making you do stupid things? He will wait for me in his truck. I come down with the documents, we flee and Europe is saved. What if the two aces never reach Paris and there is no alert? I will go up anyway. It might set off the commander, but too bad. As my old man says: "What you start you must finish!" Okay, but before being shot, do not speak of me. That's a promise. If this is it, thanks for everything. Can't you tell me where you're going or what will happen? No, it's not possible. We must look the pair, Sansonnet. And yet, Captain, I... filled the tank. Well, Sansonnet, that explains everything! This plane has a leak. "A leak"! No, it doesn't. - I preferred the first plane. - Sansonnet! That is to say, the first didn't leak. - "De ful." - What? - "The full!" - Oh, you're French. Well, Sansonnet? Well, what do you know. It is leaking. We'll need the other plane. FISHMONGER And it had to happen today! Let's offload! What did you say? We're too heavy. Something is wrong; we have to drop the bombs. Okay, I'll look for the button. - Can I? - Drop! Don't look to me for bomb advice. Press something else. How's it coming along? Captain, we're flying tilted. The other one! The other what? The other bomb! There you are! Did you launch the bomb? Well done! That's it. Tell them we're not going to Paris. You're not going to Paris? What about the alert? Go ahead, try! Good day, Sir. Is Mr. Kramer in? No, not yet. I will come back later then. - Fourth floor, on the right? - Yes. - What time is it? - It's 5:30 p.m., I believe. Thank you. JANITOR You mustn't do that, young man. - And why not? - Because the current runs through that. You will electrify the entire building. By the way, weren't you to volunteer in Germany? - No, Sir. - Too bad. You'd help the Allies there. Let's go check on the meter. What do you want? Hello, Ma'am. I had an appointment with my nephew, a young man of 25. - Would you have seen him? - No. Since I've been in the cellar for a while, my husband maybe. Edmond! Edmond! Lazy bum is out again. Can't tell you a thing. So be it. Thank you, Ma'am. You had an appointment to go to whose place? - We were going to Floch's. - Who's that? Floch, on the second floor, but we can come back. - There is no Floch here. - That explains it! He must have thought: "No Floch here, I'm off." - He must have overridden my orders. - That must be it. I'm sure of it. There was no alert, yet he still went up to save Europe. Clovis does what's asked and what's not asked of him. You should have thought of that. I hired Clovis, well trained by you to burgle, to avoid the worst! Only you can get him out of this. - I mean, without incident. - Never! I don't know the German in question. - I only know one German! - Exactly. - What, "Exactly"? - He has gone there. He's gone to Kramer's? - Fixing this will be child's play for you. - He's my sister's lover! - More reason if between brothers-in-law. - Never! - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Your men will be here in 15 minutes. If that gets stolen, shoot yourself in the head, so the firing squad won't have to. - Mr. Kramer! - Georgette! I asked you to come because I might not be able to leave until tomorrow night. You would have received your gift too late. Of course. It's kind of you to have thought of it. Come upstairs with me and I will show you. - Get in here! - No! What do I tell Kramer if he finds Clovis in a cupboard? - That he got the wrong address, hop on! - He will kill me! Not all Germans are stupid! Oh, sorry. Anymore than the French are sly. - The proof! - What proof? Had the Maginot Line fired in both directions, the Germans would have never been able to come up from behind. Okay, calm down! No! We are all going to be shot! My sister, the little brat and me, all for England! Not if we get there on time! And we're not doing it just for England! I don't care about Europe either! It's enough to do it for France! No! Adorable! How can I thank you? With your last kiss as an unmarried woman. Oh, Mr. Kramer. Off you go. I'll keep the engine on. - Your feet! - My feet? Wipe off your shoes! - Where are you going? - To see Mr. Kramer. Is he at home? - Yeah. - Oh boy! Don't leave. Yes, yes! Tell me where he left the briefcase. Oh my God. - What did you do? - We were fighting, the gun went off. Liar. You killed him to steal his papers! I swear I didn't. Ask her, she saw everything! Stop her! She can't sound the alarm! Ma'am, we did wipe off our shoes, I can assure you. You did, but not the big guy there! Enough! Don't forget-- You will not go up without wiping your shoes! Honestly! Mr. Big here won't lay down the law in my building! Seriously... Ah, these French! Their insolence is incredible! A weird bunch, these French. You never know which leg to stand on with them. It's the last time that they will treat me like that. - What's this? - It's impossible! Guard, get up here! Upstairs! Fast! I have nothing to do with it! Don't touch the railing! Come quickly, there's been a murder! Come up, we'll get out from the roof! With this mess, you'll be shot before having a chance to explain. - Quickly, while I cover for you! - No! - If she screams, kill her! - See? Be on your way, now. Leave! Your feet! So? Stop! Be careful! Ah, all the same. It's not about being Gaullist, but about not getting shot. Up! No! - What are you waiting for? - She won't budge. One second! - Of course. - That's not it. Go ahead, take your time. It's no big deal. 200 Germans on our tail. No rush. So, you want to stay here? - To tell the Krauts everything. - Yes. And they will believe me, because I-- - There you go. Excuse us but-- - "When it's necessary, it's necessary." Go, climb up! I'll push her from behind. You won't manage. I'll push, you pull. - Let's go! - It won't work. I can't pull. You're so stubborn to think-- I can push the equivalent of 50 men, but I can't pull. Go! Get everyone off the streets! - Everything okay? - Hands first! Go ahead, pull! Take your time. Knock it off! I'm doing what I can. - It's better to take her under the arms. - "Under the arms". Easy for you to say. - What if she falls? - You can let go of her. - Of course. - Hurry up! - One moment. - Okay. That's right, take your time. All civilians over here, hands against the wall! Search everybody! - What are you up to? - I'm tinkering with something! You picked the right time. The dormer window! - You got her? - Yes, I have to. Inspect the rooftops across from us. Seven men with me! Inside here! Paulo, the envelope! Remind me to give it back to you. - Search adjacent cellars! - Search all houses from top to bottom! You hit her in the same spot? Yes, she only has one chin. Let's keep going! Come on. Climb up. Be careful. Gently. There. Let's go! Give her to me. - What do we do now? - Walk and we shall see. Hello, how are you? - Hi. - How are you? - Fine, thanks. - Taking a walk? She needed a bit of air, so here we are. - Can't go wrong in this weather. - Yes. - Bye for now. - Sure, bye! Bye! Your papers, please. There. Your papers, please. - Let's go down here. - Here. - Wait. - Where are we? - On the roof. - What are we doing here? Taking a walk. With this weather, what else could we do? Stop! Up there! Hold this for me. - We'll leave you alone if you stay quiet. - Never! It seems like she enjoys it. She's slowing us down. We have to leave her somewhere. There's people here! We can't leave her with this drunk man. Let's go! Gentlemen. Stop! Hold it there! - A sewer would be ideal right now. - Yeah, right. Keep going! The large ladder. Yes, it's on the ground floor! Can we go up? Keep looking! - Georgette's room. - What about it? It's burning. Clear the road for the firetrucks! Help! Help! Help! Help! Fire! Help! Help! Help! Help! - Come quickly! - Help! - Quick! - Too late. We are happy to see you. Oh yes. Stop the winch. Stop there! Raymond! Leave that there and come here! What am I doing here? This can't be happening. What am I doing? Fantastic! I will do what I can. Come here, men. Thank you, Colonel. The first road at the top. - So? - They attacked us and stole our clothes. You'll pay for this. Quickly! They were right to choose you to avoid hell breaking loose! Thirty Germans on our tail and fire in the apartment block. - You've really spared yourself. - Lay off! If you wish to be discreet, try stopping the siren. - Yes, I know. - Especially since you have the envelope. If the siren doesn't stop, we're finished. Everything okay? Yes, step on it! - I want to get off! - Good for you! It's blocked! Stop, now! What now? Why did you connect Nogent to Champigny? I made a mistake. I did this... ...instead of... There! You see, if you open the Number Six valve, that passes through Gobelins-- That's enough. Cut the power there! Keep an eye on this man! Keep this nonsense up and you'll see what happens. That's good. - Everything okay? - Can you let me off? It's not wise in the woods. Yes, I might get punched again. Stop! This way! Step on it! Hurry up! Stop! German soldier! - Come on. - Open. Quickly! There! Climb in. He's all yours, Clovis! Clovis! Clovis! Faster! They're shooting. Duck! Didn't you hear? Careful! It's nothing, don't worry. What are you saying? If Moulinot doesn't zigzag while driving, we're screwed. We're an easy target. Give me the German's revolver and I'll break the lock. You'll get off when we stop. It's just a matter of time here. Don't bother, it's open. I'm telling that idiot to start zigzagging! - Why isn't he zigzagging? - The steering wheel is gone. Search everywhere! - Over there, at the house. - Darn it! The envelope? It's wet. Stop! Get off! Come here! Break down the door! Mission accomplished, General. We have the envelope. - And the Germans on our tail! - Quick, climb in! Reverse! - Launch! - With what? Press on! Roll out! March! That's it, it's launched. - We have to lessen our load. - What? Lessen the load? Yes, lessen the load. - Your shoes, Commander. - Yes, General. - The other one too! - The other? Yes, General. - Quick! - Yes, of course. That was the last one, General. - Something! - What? Get rid of something else! That hurts, nevertheless. - They're going to see us. - No. Hang on! The Germans! Subtitles: Karen Pawson, Silvia Rigon
