Red myrtle paste will be put on your hands. A bride's bangles will be tinkling on your wrists. A pendant will be shining on your head like the moon. There will be vermilion on your forehead, as radiant as the sun. Haven't you found till now the one you are searching for? It's time for my train, Radha. - Mahesh, will you forget me? Can I ever forget you?... Hey! Are you crying? I'm going only for 7 days. - 7 days? Even 7 seconds are too much for me. I feel as if my life is leaving me along with you. Don't say that, Radha. I'll definitely come back. When I go next, I'll be having two tickets with me. One for me, and the other for you. At that time, there will be red myrtle paste on your hands. A bride's bangles will be tinkling on your wrists. A pendant will be shining on your head like the moon. There will be vermilion on your forehead, as radiant as the sun. True? - True! Is this the time for you to come? Where had you been? To auntie's place. - I don't like your roaming around... ...and coming home late. Go and cook food; I'm coming right now. Radha... you? - Yes, I had to come. From now on, I'll be with you wherever you go. But what's the matter? Well? - What's well about it? What will people say? My father will kill himself. My life is in your hands now. Please save me! - You're worrying unnecessarily. Don't you trust me? - If I didn't, would I have left home this way? I've left everything for you. - You did the right thing. We'll go straight to Shampur. - Shampur? - Yes, to my house. I'll take you to my parents today, and marry you tomorrow. Are you happy now?... Come and sit. What's the matter? - Where's he gone? - The man with you? He had alighted at the last station, maybe to buy something. The train halts for just a minute there. He must have boarded some other coach in a hurry. The next station is Shampur. You'll find him there. When will the next train arrive? - At 11 p.m. At 11 p. M? - What's the matter? He had come with me in this train. He alighted at the previous station to buy something... ...but the train departed. - Don't worry. Tell me his name. I'll phone the station master there and tell him. His name is Mahesh; he's from this village. - Well? You go to the waiting room; I'm coming right now. What did you say? The 142 Passenger is 20 minutes late? This is your mischief! I thought the train had arrived! Even I thought that. - Kaka, let's play trains. - Come on. Come and form a line! - We've come! You come behind me; the rest will come behind you. - Good! Mummy, the train's arrived. Search properly for daddy. Hurry up. Look closely. The train's leaving; the bell's ringing. Come, Radha. Laxmi is calling you to play with her. I didn't know that my life would turn into a game. - Maybe. But play it for the sake of your daughter. The bell's ringing! Come fast! - Come, my child. The train's about to arrive. Won't you go to search for Daddy? Come fast. Till now, you have searched thousands of trains. But nobody knows when the train you're waiting for will arrive. Stop this craziness and return home to your father. I'll come with you. I'll make your father understand. - No, Kaka. I can't go home in this condition. If I ever go, then it will be with him. - With whom? The one who came from nowhere, then just vanished? Waiting for him, you've spent 5 years on the railway platform. I'll spend my entire life. I have full faith. He'll definitely come one day. Who are you searching for? - My daddy. Is he lost? - Yes, in a train like this one. Mummy! I'm here! Get down fast, the train's about to leave. You! I knew you'd come! - Who are you? Don't you recognize me? I'm Radha... your Radha! Get down fast! ...the train's leaving! - Who's she? I don't know. She seems to be mad. - Mad? Am I mad? No, Mahesh! I'm Radha, your wife! Here... see the sign of our love! So many years have passed. These are different times. I searched in each and every train. I was waiting for you to take me to your house. Mahesh, get down fast! Have you gone mad? Do you want to die? Holding onto a running train! ...Go home! Mummy! Are you crying? Don't cry. Daddy will definitely come in the next train. No, my child. That train won't ever come now! Don't cry, child. Your mother will be coming right now. Don't cry. Be quiet. Did you find out anything? - No. We searched everywhere... ...but couldn't learn anything about Radha. - Okay, go now. Where has she gone? Dear Kaka, you always used to say that I'm mad. Today I've realized that I'm really mad. After thousands of trains, the one I was waiting for arrived. He was in that train, but I wish it never arrived. When parted from him, I lived with the support of my faith. Even that support is gone. I have no reason to live any more. That's why I'm writing this letter. There's one for my father too. Hand over Laxmi and the letter to him. Tell him not to punish my child for my sins. Yours, Radha. Where's mummy gone, Kaka? - She'll be coming right now. Did you call me, Boss? - Yes. Take these tickets. Shyama and you will go to Calcutta today. Reaching Calcutta... - I'll have to give this box to Sharif. And take from him another box similar to this. I shouldn't peek inside any of the two boxes. Am I right? - You've learnt your lesson like a parrot. I've become one, since the time I was locked in your cage. You've cut my tongue, and also plucked my wings. You've been paid for that. You lead a comfortable life. Else, what would you have become? A clerk in some office, buried under heaps of files! I remember that lesson too. You've nothing new to say. - I do. You won't do in Calcutta what you did in the hills last time. But, Boss... - I don't want to listen to anything! All right, I won't do it. I have shut the windows of my eyes and the door to my heart. If any girl knocks, I'll tell her: "Find some other house." "This door is locked; the key is with my boss." All right? - Yes. Shyama... keep an eye on him. Sir, is this Mr. Ramprasad's house? Yes... please come in. - Come, my child. Come, child... Please sit. Are you Mr. Ramprasad? - No. He died 2 years back. - O God! I'm his younger brother Nanakchand. Where have you come from? - From Shampur. I'm the stationmaster there. - I'm really glad to meet you. 5 years back, your brother's daughter Radha had come to Shampur. She stayed at my place like my daughter. - Shampur? Radha stayed there for so many years, but we didn't even know! This is Laxmi, Radha's daughter. - Radha's daughter? Come here, child. I'm your grandfather. Where's your mother? - Will you please come out for a moment? Sit here. This is a letter Radha wrote to her father before leaving. You will learn everything from it. Nanakji, I have to return to duty. Look after Laxmi. Don't worry. I'll take every care of her. Laxmi! - Yes, Kaka? - Come here. Come! I had told you that I'll take you to your other grandfather. He is your other grandfather. You'll have to stay with him now. Your mom and dad will be coming very soon. When they come, we'll all go to meet you at the station. - All right. Let's go in... What would you like to eat? I don't want to eat anything. - Why? Kaka has given me everything. - But you'll have to eat something. You don't feel tired while eating! - The shrew has arrived! You eat like hell, but walk as if your legs are broken! You're becoming like a baby elephant! Move fast! Careful! It will fall! ...Move fast! Who's this girl? - I'm Laxmi! Speak softly; I'm not deaf! From where have you picked her up? - She's Radha's daughter. That same Radha, who had run away with some hooligan? Because of that disgrace, her father had to commit suicide! Has that wretch returned? Beware if you speak ill of my mother! Speak from a distance, you daughter of Dara Singh! You're so little, but speak such big words! Don't make me get angry! I'll strangle you! - Let it be! Leave my hand! What's it? Tell me! - Speak softly! The poor Radha won't return again. - Why? She's no more. - That's good. An elderly stationmaster left her daughter here. If we don't look after her now, who will? Only you are left in this world to look after everyone! God has you given you everything but a brain! Just think: If we keep her here, what will happen to us? - What? She will grow up one day, then demand her rights. This entire property isn't yours, but your elder brother's. Her grandfather's, and her mother's. She'll live like a queen, but we'll have to beg on the streets. We don't have any offspring to keep our name alive. Are you any great king for your name to be kept alive? Don't say that... Read this letter from Radha. You'll start crying like me! - Like hell! Give it! Bhola! - Coming, auntie! - Hurry up! Take this letter, and drop this trash at Master's place! I won't go to Master's house! - You'll have to! I didn't go to school; Master will thrash me! - I'll thrash you first! Granny, don't hit him! - Who are you to call me "granny"? You're staring at my eyes as if you're my rival! You're the rival... a fat one! - I won't leave her today! Leave her! She's a child! - She said I'm her fat rival! Listen... They're making such a racket! What can I do? I'm reading this book on birth control. Haven't you heard: "Small family, happy family"? You've started reading this book after fathering 11 children! Shut up! Don't make any noise! - Masterji! What's it, Bhola? - Shut up! Go from here! Aunt Bhagyawanti has sent these 2 things for you. This letter, and this Laxmi. So Bhagyawanti has sent this calamity to our house! That witch isn't destined to have even one child herself! There are already 11 in our house; let there be one more. Uncle, can I stay here with you? - You wretch! You want to stay here? - Why not? She's my niece's daughter. You can't feed your own children, but talk of your niece's daughter! What about your wealthy brother Jeevandas? Bhola, take her away! Bhola! Stop! See what you were about to do in your anger! Instead of Laxmi, you'd have sent away your own child! - My child! I may be rich, but my house isn't any inn or orphanage. Who knows which gutter this piece of filth comes from? I can't take responsibility for her! Take her away! Let her beg at some bus stand or railway station! Let's go, Bhola! I won't stay here! See her prudery! See his appearance! He looks like a devil! What did you say? You witch! You she-devil! You are a monster, a devil! What did you say? Get out of here! - Don't hit her! Get up, Laxmi! - The miserable scoundrel! Wherever you go, you're thrown out. Where will you go now? - To my mother. Where's your mother? - She's gone in search of daddy. Where's your daddy? - In Bombay. Trains take people to Bombay. - Do they? - Yes. - Let's go then. When will this train reach Bombay? - Tomorrow. You didn't buy a ticket! If anyone catches me, what will I do? Little children don't require tickets. - Really? - Yes. The train's leaving. Take this 5 paise for your expenses. When you meet your parents, write to me. Will you? - Yes. I'll be going now. Hey girl! Where's your ticket? Bhola said little children don't require tickets. Don't you know even such a small thing? Drink it, my sweet child. Eat, child; don't be fussy. Mummy! Mummy! Where are you? Mother! Feed the poor; God will shower you with blessings! Mother! Feed the poor; God will shower you with blessings! From where have you arrived? Begging from a beggar! I'm not a beggar. My name is Laxmi. My mother's name is Radha. She's come here in search of daddy. I've come to Bombay in search of both of them. How can such a little girl find her parents in this big city? Do you have your father's address? - No. Then how will you reach him? - I have my parents' photo. Here it this. How can a blind man like me see any photo? You come with me. We'll roam everywhere. I'll beg, and you search for your parents. But you'll have to stay with me. Will you? - Yes. Uncle, I haven't eaten anything since yesterday; I'm hungry. Are you hungry? Come, first I'll give you food. I still have the rest of my life left for begging. Come. Run! - Are the police coming? - No, it's Dada! Dada, what will you do with these ladies' sandals? - You rascal! Who are you to ask what I'll do with these? But what will I tell my father? - Tell your father... ...that his grandfather had come and taken them. Hey, you son of a washerman! ...Hey, Ramcharan! What are you doing? - Putting up a board. - Leave it! One can't reach heaven by climbing this wooden ladder. Neither can you change your status by putting up a board. Whether you write "dryers" or "dry cleaners" on it... ...you'll remain just a washerman! Get down! Bring out the money! Even if I earn a million, I'll remain your slave. - Shut up! What are you waiting for? Get lost! My love, I admit that you always say the right thing. But see what I have brought for you. Sandals? - No! They are the hearts of lovers! Wear them. - Leave it! - What are you saying? Wearing these, when you come with me to see a film... ...everyone will get jealous! - Take these sandals to your mom! If you dare to look at my sister, I'll gouge out your eyes! And if you ever speak to him again, I'll thrash you in public! Child, we have reached my colony. Anwar, you look very happy today. - Yes, Dada. I'm very happy today. - Who's this girl? Whose child is she? - I had gone to beg... ...and God put this treasure on my lap. But what about my money? - I'll give it to you tomorrow. God knows that I've got just 50 paise today. With it, I'll have to buy food for both her and myself. Do you want to chuck me off? Bring out the 50 paise! For God's sake, don't take it! I had to struggle so much to get it today! I have to shout till I drop; only then will someone show kindness. Why do you tell me? Go and tell the Almighty... ...who's created such great differences amongst humans. One man is a millionaire, but another is a miserable wretch. It's He who made me a hooligan and you a blind beggar. You may not be blind, but God made you a beggar too. A worse beggar than me. - What? Calling me a beggar? Repeat what you said! - I'll say it a hundred times! You're not only a beggar, but also a robber and a bandit! A bandit who doesn't even spare a dead man's shroud! How dare you say that? Have you forgotten who I am? Uncle! Are you hurt? - No, my child. Dada, I'd really forgotten who you are, and what I am. This is how good people like you show the way to blind persons. Dada, where are you? Why don't you speak? I'm standing right in front of you! - In front of me? - Yes! Uncle! Uncle! They've all fled! Glory to my master! Give me pickle for 5 paise. Where's this new car come from? Who's sitting inside it? Haven't you recognized him? He's the washerman Ramcharan. He's won a lottery of rupees 2.5 lakhs. - 2.5 lakhs? Hey washerman! Getting money, have you lost your mind? Vacating this shop, where are you running off to? What about my 2 shirts that you misplaced? - Leave my coat! Speak from a distance! Your shirts were in tatters. You bought them from Chor Bazar for Rs. 3 each. Take this money and buy two terrylene shirts. You'll remember this meeting with a rich man. Wow, pal! You're great! Money can change a man so much! - Absolutely! You'd said one can't reach heaven by climbing a ladder. - Yes. He can definitely reach heaven; even go to the moon. Only, the ladder has to be made of silver. This is all a miracle caused by the lottery! Raghu, empty the shop fast. I've to catch a plane for Delhi. Drink this. - Hey Almighty! Let me win a lottery too! What's a lottery, Uncle? - Eat this first, then I'll tell you. There are 2 types of games in this world: One is of nature, and the other is of luck. Lottery is a game of luck. A lucky man buys a ticket for 1 rupee... ...and wins rupees 2.5 lakhs. - How much do 2.5 lakhs come to? It's a huge amount; I may not be able to count it. It's around this much. - This much? - Yes. Suppose we win it, what will happen then? Why think of it? We'll never win that prize. - Why not? If we had such luck, we wouldn't have been street beggars. Suppose we do win it, then what? - All right. If we do win it, it won't be difficult to spend it in this huge city. First of all, we'll stop eating Chhamia's bread and fries. We'll have dinner at the Taj Mahal Hotel everyday. We'll leave this hut and buy a big house at Malabar Hill. Instead of wearing torn clothes, we'll buy nice, new ones. What else will we buy? - We'll buy a car. Then we'll go in the car everyday to beg. She's so naive! She says we'll go in the car everyday to beg! The time hasn't come for car owners to beg. Why don't car owners beg? - Nature has made me blind. But some people have been turned blind by money. And such a blind person never begs; he eats up the beggar. What else will we buy? - If a man has money, what can't he buy? Can one buy his parents with money? - Yes, even that. Then buy a ticket. I'll buy my parents. I'll buy a ticket; have your food first. Hurry up! Move forward!... Coming to buy a ticket! Take this money and get a ticket. Move off! Give me a ticket! - How dare you come in between? He thinks he's going to win the prize! Move off! - Uncle! - What's the matter? It's nothing; she's just fooling. Give me a lucky ticket. ...Wow! Give me a ticket. 0... 3... 5... 8... 7 What are you doing? - Writing the ticket no. On the wall. When the ticket is with us, why do have to write its number? Suppose we lose the ticket and forget its number? Greed doesn't spare anyone. Write on all the walls. When will the newspaper vendor arrive? - Very soon. There'll be trouble. Everyone's waiting for the lottery result. He's come! I'm ruined! You bloody! I earned the money through so much labour! I wagered Rs.5, but didn't win even Rs.100! - Shut up! Let me see! ...Wait! 4... 4... 0... 3... 5! It's five! Glory to Goddess Kali! - What happened? There are 2 more numbers; read them. - They'll also tally! Read! - It's eight! Read further! - Mother Kali, I'll give you offerings worth Rs.2.50! Let my seventh number tally too! I'm ruined! One digit made me lose! Instead of 7, I have no.6! The person who was behind me won! I lost rupees 2.5 lakhs! Your intentions were wrong. You asked Mother Kali for 2.5 lakhs. But your offerings were worth Rs.2.50. - Don't hassle me! Let me think. Who was standing behind me? - Kalu? - No! Lacchu? - No! - Then who was it? That's what I'm trying to remember. Who was behind me? I ruined myself! ...Wallop me with this! - What happened? Tell me! I was in the line, then that unknown girl came in front of me. I pushed her behind and came in front of her. Laxmi! Where are you? Remain there! I'm bathing, don't look this side! A grown up woman is bathing! How can this blind man see you? Show your face first. - Why, Uncle? Open your mouth. Sweets? - Yes... you own lakhs now! You've won the lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs! - Really? - Yes! Will you buy my parents for me now? - Yes, sure. But first keep your ticket at a safe place. Here's the ticket. - Hide it at a safe place. Many thieves will be coming here. - All right. Are you teaching me to steal? - No! I'm making you rich! If you keep making "bhajias", you won't earn even Rs.2.50. I'm telling you of 2.5 lakhs! - No! I'm feeling scared! I'm standing firmly beside you! Turn your heart to steel! The key to our fortune is lying in that blind man's house! Go, my queen, my darling! Anwar Kaka! - What is it, Chhamia? - It's nothing. Lachhu has come home and is asking for tea. But you have such a big oven in the market. It's turned cold. Can I make some tea fast? - Yes, go on. I came to make tea, but left the tea powder at home! Go and bring it, my sweet child. I heard she has won the lottery. I was so happy. Go and make your tea. What did you drop? - I was just searching for the matchbox. It's near the window. I'll get it. - No, Kaka! Don't trouble yourself. I'll find it. O Allah! What happened, Chhamia? What happened? Why are you laughing? A scorpion has bitten Chhamia. I understand now! Pretending to make tea, she had come to steal the ticket! Could she have taken it? - No. I hid it. - Where? - In the stove. What have you done? It must have been burnt to ashes! No. Before going, I had taken it out. Here it is. You're even smarter than Chhamia! See, child... Sit here... I'm an old man, and you're a little child. This colony has turned into a jungle today. Wolves are lurking at every place for you and me. We should escape from here tonight. - Tonight? - Yes. Until I hand over you and your 2.5. lakhs to your parents... ...I'll get neither peace in the day, nor sleep at night. Have mercy, O Lord. Laxmi, are you asleep? - No, I'm awake. - Even you are awake! During our begging days, we used to sleep so deeply. But now, when we have lakhs, we get neither sleep, nor peace. Keep the ticket with you; I feel scared. No. You keep it. - Why? Thinking I have the ticket, everyone will come after me. First I'll fight them with my staff. If I don't succeed, then I'll hand them to the police. - Police? There's some noise coming from outside. - Bring my staff. Her it is. - You remain inside; don't come out. If you are men, then come forward! Will anyone dare to face this blind man's staff? ...Come! I'll kill all of you! ...Come! There's no one. Laxmi! Why are you sitting alone? Why are these things packed? Where's Anwar? - He's gone out. When will he return? - I don't know. I've brought these toys for you. See this airplane. And this cart... Do you want them? - Yes. - Take them. I've also brought delicious sweets for you. Jalebis! ...Eat them. All these are for you... How's it? - Excellent. Even you're so nice, my sweet child! Now tell me where that ticket is. - What ticket? - Lottery ticket. That ticket? - Yes. Where's it? Tell me. On the roof?... Inside that pot? How fortunate that pot is to have Rs.2.5 lakhs in it! Hey Laxmi! She's duped me and escaped! Tell us where that ticket is! I said I don't have it with me! - He won't give it this way! Where's the ticket? Speak! I'll skin you alive! I said I don't have it with me! - Don't you have it? Kaalia, come here! Even after so much thrashing, he doesn't speak a word. Maybe he kept the ticket with that girl. - With that girl? I see! On the 8th, withdraw Rs.12 lakhs from the Bank of Baroda... ...and pay the cement company people. - Yes Sir. On the 9th, withdraw Rs.8 lakhs from the State Bank of India... ...and pay the oil company people. - Yes Sir. Arrange for my departure to Japan on the 10th. Please save me, Sir! - Hey! Move back! Even beggars have started entering cars! Who are you? I'm Laxmi; my mother's name is Radha. I've won a lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs. People are chasing me to snatch the ticket. Please help me! Why are you standing outside? Come and sit inside. Don't worry. Secretary, take a taxi to the office. Driver, stop the car. Bring sweets, chocolates, biscuits, etc. For the child. Hurry up. There's no one here. Now tell me where that ticket is. What are you thinking of, child? Give me that ticket, and I'll give you Rs.2.5 lakhs. First show me the 2.5 lakhs. Here's Rs.2.5 lakhs. Close your fist tightly. And here's the ticket. Close your fist tightly too. - Yes! Sir... - Yes... go. Greetings... What do you wish to listen to today, Sir? Sing whatever you wish, Champa Bai. Greetings. - Thank you. Sing something really electrifying today, Champa Bai. I've lost Rs.2.5 lakhs today. It came into my hands, then just slipped away. How, Sir? - Don't ask that; just start your song. Who are you? - I'm Laxmi; my mother's name is Radha. I've won a lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs. People are after me in order to snatch the ticket. They're so big; I'm so small ...what shall I do? Where's the ticket? What are you thinking of? Give me the ticket, and come with me. I'll see anyone who dares to touch you. Come with me; we'll go and make a phone call. You wait here while I make the call. The "bhajiya" woman! - Laxmi! Hello, it's me... Hey girl!... One minute! ...Hey girl! Laxmi! ...Wait! Swami Kishoreanandam Keertan Ashram, Khar, Bombay - 52. Beautiful lady, keep coming here from time to time. - Master! Master! - Yes, my child? Do you have any misgiving? Leaving the Gita lesson, why did you give a film lesson today? Son, there's a great mystery behind this. Seeing that beautiful lady, I remembered my past. I used to work in a big film company and had many cronies. And, like the common and foolish man... ...even I got entangled in the net of worldly desires. - Which net? Son, I had fallen in love with a dream girl. What happened then? - That which always happens. That girl dishonored my virtuous love... ...and I, failing to win her love, became mad. Master, what happened then? - When I came to my senses... ...I broke my attachment to this world and came to Krishna. What this I'm seeing? Lord Krishna Himself in my temple! I'm not Krishna. I'm Laxmi; my mother's name is Radha. I've won a lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs. People want to snatch the ticket from me. Help me, Baba! - 2.5 lakhs! Strange are your ways, O Lord! Bring out the ticket and place it at the Lord's feet. - Leave me! What are you thinking of, child? ...I understand now! O Lord! Your world is so strange! She's escaping from thieves, but doesn't trust a holy man! Foolish girl, you don't know who I am. I'm a great devotee of Lord Madhava. Garlands studded with priceless jewels hang from His neck. Hey girl! Just listen to what I am saying. ...I was saying... ...will the hands that touch these jewels everyday... ...snatch away your worthless ticket? Bearded saint, it's not worthless, but worth 2.5 lakhs. - Child... For devotees, even 2.5 crores are like the ashes in a crematorium. I'm very hungry. - Hungry? Lord, is this your pastime too? 2.5 lakhs in her hand, but nothing in her stomach! I won't let you go today! - Swamiji! Are you scared? Laxmi can't leave Narayan's house hungry. I'll give you nice food, then put you to sleep in a cradle. Forgive me, Lord! Not here, but somewhere else! Where? Quiet! Benevolent One! 2.5 lakhs! 2.5 lakhs! Child! What's this, O Lord? Both the ticket and the girl are gone! Where do I search for her? - Master! Hey girl! - Master! - Let me go! First I'll fight them with my stick. If I don't succeed, then I'll hand them to the police. Where do you want to go? - To the police station. - Which one? The one that is nearest. - All right. Buy your ticket. You have to buy a ticket in a bus; don't you know? Bhola said that small children don't require tickets. Don't you know? - Girl! Sit down! This is not a bus stop! - Let's go from behind! What are you doing? This is not a bus stop! Go and sit! Stop! Come on! Coachman! ...Let's go! Drive fast! - So, Laxmi! Almighty, you always give in plenty, anytime, anywhere! Drive fast! - Those people are after us! Who's that bearded mendicant? ...Come on - move! Help! - Brother! - Shut up! You wanted to grab the entire 2.5 lakhs! You forgot my share! Bring him down first, then talk of your share! Let him remain there! Where's the girl? I've understood my brother, and also your love! What about my share? - Shut up! Or I'll cut you into two! Money can divide a brother and sister... ...and turn lovers into enemies! - You tell us what to do now! I can only advise you not to be too greedy. Don't think only of yourself. Think of the whole world. All of us should have an equal share in this 2.5 lakhs. But who will divide it equally? - I'll do it! To protect religion and justice, even I'll have to take a share. Do you agree? - Yes. - Then join hands. But find that girl first. - We'll find her somewhere. Hey girl! Where are you going? Uncle, where's the police station? - Why? Who are you? I'm Laxmi; my mother's name is Radha. I've won a lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs. Some people are after me to snatch the ticket. Who's after you? Don't be scared; I'm a police officer. Where's the ticket? Uncle, even he was trying to catch me! Inspector James! Even you? I mean, I wanted to protect her and her 2.5 lakhs. But she thought me to be a thief too, and ran away. Is it true? - Yes. I didn't want to give this ticket away. I want to buy my parents with it. - What are you saying? Where are your parents? - Right here in Bombay. - Where? I don't know. - Then how will the police find them? I have their photo... This is mummy, and this is daddy. Laxmi has made the police's job very easy. Publish this photo in every newspaper. Till her parents are found, keep her under police protection. Come, baby. - Go, child. Uncle James is a very nice man. You have nothing to be scared of now. Go. - Come. You weep in front of Mother everyday, asking for a child. Your prayer has been answered. God has sent a doll for you. See... You can certainly play with her for a few days. She's as beautiful as an angel. Who's she? - Ask her yourself. What's your name? - I'm Laxmi; my mother's name is Radha. I've won a lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs. We've won a lottery, because you've come to our house. How fortunate her parents are to get her from God. Why are you waiting? Go and buy some nice frocks for her. Wait! ...Her hair has to be cut. - Should I get her a haircut? Never! What will her parents say when they see her? They won't say anything. You policemen are always suspicious. Give me. I'll take her myself. Don't you feel ashamed to call yourself her granny today? That day, you didn't keep the orphaned girl for even one day. The poor girl had to go away weeping. But your behavior was worse than an enemy's! You keep an army at home, but sent away that orphan girl! Who was at fault... you, or we? She's mocking your army, but you're silent! Yes, I'll speak that way! What will you do? Don't leave her! Lt'll be decided today who's stronger! Two women are fighting, and you're having fun! - Shut up! What's this racket? Is this a fish market? Who are you people? - We're Laxmi's relatives! All of you? - Yes! We're all together! - Yes, we are! Wonderful! I admire your unity! I'm Laxmi's uncle. I'm a schoolteacher. If Laxmi stays with me, she can study a lot. I'm Laxmi's younger uncle. All these are vagabonds; I'm rich. Laxmi can live with me most comfortably. - Move aside! You speak! - This is my husband! - What are you saying? No, she's my wife. We're Laxmi's nearest relatives. What's the difference between a grandfather and his brother? But Laxmi will herself decide where she wants to go. Laxmi! Come! - Come to auntie first! - Move off! Let your auntie go to hell! Come to grandmother first! Shut up! Go back to your places! - This is my place! Laxmi, do you know all of them? - Yes; I know all of them. Come, my child! - Weren't you the one who scolded me? Come, my dear! - You abused and threw me out of your house! Come, Laxmi! - You had called me a dirty, heinous witch! She's a child; she's just saying what comes to her mouth. But you're an inspector; you're a sensible man. You kept our child with you for so many days. Keep 5% from the lottery money for yourself. Give us the remaining money. We won't fight for the rest; we'll divide it amongst ourselves. You will! You're pining for the Rs.2.5 lakhs. When this innocent girl didn't have anything... ...you considered her a burden, and insulted and abused her. But today, she's become your dearest relative! Are you human beings or something else? Don't teach us humanity! Even we know the law very well! And we can fight for our legal rights! Sentry! Bring my gun! - Gun? What's this? We were speaking of the law... ...but you're talking of your gun! - I'll count till three! After 3, I should see none of you here! Else, you all know what's going to happen! A wife, a child, and a dowry of Rs.2.5 lakhs! See this. What are you saying? - This newspaper is speaking, not me. When fortune smiles, it smiles this way! Where did you meet her? - In the hills. You said you didn't do anything there. Now do just one thing. Go to Inspector James, and ask for your Rs. 2.5 lakhs. But the child? - Leave her to me. Anwar Kaka! You're lying alone in the dark! What's the matter? What difference do light and darkness make to a blind man? After Laxmi left, the darkness inside me has increased. And I have a fever that doesn't allow me to move. That's why you didn't come to my shop for two days. I'll get you some food right now. - No, Chhamia. After Laxmi left me, I couldn't even drink a drop of water. Who knows where she's gone? Where do I search for her? You picked up a child from the street a few days back... ...and got so attached to her. When someone's child dies... ...he cremates the child. Even then... - Chhamia! For God's sake, don't say such things! What do you know about sorrow for one's child? As soon as I was born, my mother died. When I was 4, I turned blind due to smallpox. Sorrowing for this, my father died. And now... ...in my old age, Allah has parted my Laxmi from me! What do you know about what Laxmi meant to me? I can't live without her! O God! - Kaka, don't cry. I'm only sorry that Laxmi took the ticket of Rs.2.5 lakhs. If you had the ticket... ...at least you'd have escaped from this hell of poverty. You describe poverty as hell. Go and ask the rich what sort of hell they live in. I don't want money; I just want my child. I beg you! For God's sake, tell me where she is! I don't know where she is right now. But, a few days back, I had seen her at Churchgate. Did you see my Laxmi at Churchgate? My Laxmi is in Churchgate! Bring my staff! ...Laxmi!... What are you doing? - Decorating the Christmas tree. What's this, Uncle? - I'm Santa Claus! It's not yet night, and you're in a hurry to be Santa Claus. I want to see how I look in a beard. Just see how a child can change the entire world. Our Christmas tree always used to look so dry. But now, it seems as if spring has come to our house. Let's go and decorate the room upstairs. Who's this Santa Claus? - He comes from the land of fairies. At night, he gives beautiful gifts to children. He gives whatever one asks for. - Does he give parents too? Yes, he gives parents too. ...Come... I want to meet Inspector James. - You're speaking to him. Yes? - I'm Mahesh. Laxmi, whose ad. You gave, is my daughter. I've come to take her. - Come in. Have you come alone? - Yes. Didn't you bring Laxmi's mother with you? No. - Why? Where is she? She... - What's the matter? What happened? Laxmi! Come to me! Come to your daddy! - No! You were in the train! Mummy kept crying and pleading! But you left her and went away! Don't believe her. You put my photo in the papers, and I'm here in front of you. What else do you want? - I don't want anything. But the police want evidence. So it'll be best if you bring Laxmi's mother with you. Yes. Radha is no more in this world. She lived here for many years. She used to look inside every window of each passing train. And searched like mad for the man who played with her life. What relation did you have with Radha? - A distant relation. So you're a distant relative of Radha. See, Bhiku? This devil doesn't admit even now... ...that he's Radha's husband. Worthless scoundrel! You... here? - Radha? ...Radha, who? Her name is Girja. The same looks, the same personality! Who are you talking of? - My wife... She's the one. My eyes can't deceive me. - But they are deceiving right now. She's my sister. - Your sister? Yes. She's just come from Benaras. - From Benaras? Where have you come to search for your wife? Come and sit! Wonderful! - Fabulous! Come here for a minute. - I'm sorry; I'm really tired. After dancing so much, my feet are aching. Whatever you say, she can only be Radha. She's Girja. Won't I know my own sister? Let me meet her just once. I'll just speak a few words with her and leave. Not today, come tomorrow. The same face, same eyes, same appearance! But she says that she's not Radha! And she can't be. Because Radha would rather die than step inside a brothel. Who says you've to spend the rest of your life with a harlot? You just have to play a game that is really easy for you. You haven't seen her anger, Boss. She wears anklets, but her talk is so big. - I know you very well. Once you see her eye-to-eye... ...she'll be wearing shackles on her feet instead of anklets. You'll have to do this job. - If I dont? Come near... nearer... more... I never accept "no"! I want the 2.5 lakhs! Understand? Ready, baby? Shall I come? Let's see how this thief escapes the police. Where's that small, lovely thief gone? I've caught her! - Uncle has caught Auntie! Okay, I did! It's auntie's turn now; tie this and get ready. Uncle! Uncle! - Laxmi! My child! Where had you gone? Are you all right? - I'm fine. Come and meet my uncle. - What uncle? - Police uncle. Did the police catch you? - No. My uncle is a police officer. Let's go inside. - Come on. Police uncle, this is my uncle. And they are uncle and auntie. Greetings, Sir. - Greetings. Laxmi has told us everything about you. Please come in. Come with me. There's a sofa here, sit on it. - How can I sit in front of you? You're a govt. Officer, and I'm a lowly beggar. - Don't say that. You're Laxmi's uncle. So this house belongs to you too. Sit. Thank you very much. Have you found out anything about Laxmi's parents? We haven't learnt anything till now. Many relatives had come to take the 2.5 lakhs, though. Even her father had come just for the money. Her mother is still untraceable. The police are trying their best. May God give you success... Okay, I'll be going now. Uncle, I'll come with you too. - No, my child. Stay here with your uncle. Where will you go with me? My hut can't give you the comfort you'll get here. Will you permit something, Sir? - Yes? Whenever I miss Laxmi, can I come here? Do you have to ask? - Be happy. May God look after you. May God bless your house... I'm going, Laxmi. Uncle! - Laxmi, my child! James, see what God has done. He has given eyes to Laxmi's relatives, but not hearts. He's made this poor man blind, but given him such a big heart. Namaste. - You? You've come to this market so early in the morning. This is the time to go to the temple. I haven't come to a marketplace, but to a temple. I've brought flowers for the goddess. - Me, a goddess? Yes... You don't belong to this brothel, this market, Radha. Sir, my name is not Radha, but Girja. Whoever you are, I love you. - So strange! You met me just last night, and are already in love with me! It seems you carry your heart on your palms. No. I have a wound in my heart. But you can cure it. - How? You look exactly like my wife Radha. She's no more. If you marry me, I'll feel as if I've found my Radha again. Splendid! Champa says that every rich man comes here... ...leaving behind an innocent and upright wife. I don't want you to be my wife for just one night. I want you to be with me for life. - Really? Yes. I want these hands to be adorned with myrtle paste. I wish that a bride's bangles tinkle on these wrists... ...and that a pendant shine like the sun on this forehead. I'm speaking the truth. Make your sister understand. I hope you won't do the same thing... ...that someone else did to me. Like the "paan" a man lovingly puts into his mouth. He chews and enjoys it, then spits it out! - Never! I'll always keep her close to me. I'm responsible for my sister. I want to see her happy always. Have faith in me. - All right. My sister will marry, but it won't be a bogus marriage. Her marriage will be held with full rites. Do you agree? I agree. The way you are adorned, you look like the perfect bride. Seeing you, who'll say that you're a harlot? - That's all right. Now tell me the real thing: What do you want from me? An upright man like you won't marry a woman like me... ...just for the sake of an old memory. Then listen... my Radha has left behind a child. The child has won a lottery of Rs.2.5 lakhs. I'm in desperate need of money. We can get that 2.5 lakhs. You'll have to act as my wife in Inspector James' house. Why should I act? I am your wife. - That's all right. But you'll have to call my child your own there. - No! I can never make my rival's daughter my own! Don't worry. I'm not going to keep her with me forever. I just want that 2.5 lakhs. You'll have to do it. Okay? - Okay. Yes? - Tell Sir that Laxmi's parents have come to meet her. Please come and sit. You're trembling so much! Do you remember what to say? Yes, I remember everything. I never forget anything. So you've come! Yes, inspector. I haven't come alone this time. Laxmi's mother is also with me. So you are Laxmi's mother? - Yes, inspector. Please call my daughter; I'm yearning to see her. Where was this yearning before? Recall that day... ...when you left Laxmi at the station, alone and helpless. How did your motherly feelings arise today all of a sudden? I had come to Bombay in search of my husband. And where did you go after leaving this house? To search for your wife? I want proof of your marriage. Bring my daughter to me once, and you'll get your proof. All right... Laxmi! - What's it, Uncle? Mummy! Leaving me, where did you go? - I was searching for you. Have you got your proof now? Now bring out the money. Be patient. Your money won't run away. Mahesh, here's your ticket. - Don't give it to him! Give it to me. Only I have a right to it; I'm Laxmi's mother. But I'm her father. - You're not! You're a swindler! You're not human, but a beast! You've become a father only for the 2.5 lakhs! Even you've become a mother only for this money! Inspector, she's not Radha, but Girja. She resembles Radha, but she's not Laxmi's mother. I'll tell you where I brought her from. - I'll tell it myself! Inspector, I've been brought from a brothel! But... - Laxmi! - Isn't she upstairs? - No! Laxmi! - What happened? Uncle! Laxmi! ...Why are you crying? I won't go anywhere! I'll stay with you! - Yes, you will! But what's the matter? - I don't have anyone in this world! I don't have any mother or father! Only you're there, Uncle! But tell me why you're so distraught. A woman says that she's my mother... ...and a man says that he's my father! But both of them are liars and impostors! Laxmi! Open the door, my child! Come to me! Uncle! She's the woman who wants to take me away! Help me! Laxmi, come out! I'm your mother! - No! You resemble my mother, but you're not she! For God's sake, come out! Or I'll break the door! Uncle, help me! She's not my mother! - Don't worry! She won't be able to even touch you! Bring my staff! I'll break all her bones! Mummy! - Laxmi, my child! My darling! He's Anwar uncle. He had bought the lottery ticket for me. He loves me very much... Uncle, she's my real mother. Namaste, Baba. - God bless you, child. Laxmi, you've found your mother; I'm so happy! But haven't you found your father? Are you surprised to see me alive? When you'd said "Radha" with love for the first time... ...my entire heart had started palpitating. But now, I felt as if a spear had stabbed my heart! I'd have taken my life, but Champa stopped me. She said: "If you'd die for a devil, can't you live for this angel?" You played a nice game! - You played it for the 2.5 lakhs! For that money, you even married me! Now I can tell the world that my daughter is a legitimate child! I won't let even your shadow fall on her now. Come, my child. - Sister... Take this. I don't need any more evidence now. Take this, Baba. - What's this? - The lottery ticket. For which, the entire city had turned blind. Will you do me a favor? - Yes, Baba? Deposit the 2.5 lakhs in the bank in Laxmi's name. Give her an excellent education. When she grows up, get her married into a nice, poor family. Keep it with you. And see... begging is my profession. I beg something from you today. - Order me; I'll give you my life. If possible, bring Laxmi to see me here sometimes. I desire nothing else. If I live, I'll surely come to her wedding. Take her now; something happens to my heart! Goodbye! Uncle, are you crying? - No, I'm laughing! Won't you come with us? Mummy, take Uncle too. Don't leave him alone. If he doesn't come, then even I won't come with you. Baba, come with us. I promise at your feet that both of us will look after you. I'm blind; I don't want to be a burden on you. Who says you're blind now? We are your eyes. Will you be able to live without Laxmi? - No! Then come with us. - Come! - Where did you throw my staff? You won't need it now... Come! - Let's go. Taxi, Madam? Where are you going? - To Bombay Central. Baba, you come in the front. What's this? I told you to take us to Bombay Central! Mummy! - What are you doing? - What happened? The driver's taking away my child! - Hey driver! Bring out that ticket! - Who are you? - Move off! What do you want: The 2.5 lakhs, or your child? - No! I want my Laxmi! Here's the ticket! - Radha! Don't give him the ticket! - You? Leave the child! - You dared to do this? - Yes! The ticket belongs to this child, not even me! And you won't be able to even touch it! Mahesh, you know that I can spill blood for 2.5 lakhs! You can't do anything! Gopal! Ramu! Shyam! Let go! - Mummy! Watch out! Bring out the ticket, or I'll kill Laxmi! Radha, give the ticket!... I said give it! Leave the child! - The ticket first! Leave the child first! - All right! Put the ticket on the table, and I'll leave the girl! - Okay, Boss! Get all of them! Radha! I've brought the police! What happened? - Nothing! God be thanked! Radha, here's your Laxmi. Take good care of her. Child, here's your ticket. Say it once more! My child! Daddy, we'll all live together now. No, my child. I'm not worthy of even my shadow falling on you. Your mother will never forgive me. I've given her only tears. But you'll give me happiness now. Baba, let's go! Yes! God is great!
