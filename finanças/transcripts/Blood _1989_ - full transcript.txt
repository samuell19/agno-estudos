Do what you want with me. Don't leave me. - What am I going to tell Nino? - That I'm dead. BLOOD The night was dark No moon shone In the distance A wolf howIed all alone. Vicente! - Rosa! - Nino! There was no stopping her. I don't know what got into her. Are you boys alone again? Just for a while. I only know about you because Nino tells me everything. I don't know. He's away for his treatment. Who hurt you? I told you a million times not to come here alone. And then the teachers blame me. Look at you. Sometimes you scare me. Do you remember? Nino, let's go home. Daddy's waiting. Daddy? Nobody woke up today. There's no bread. And Dad missed his bus. Vicente told you that? I didn't hear you go out. I always do. This kid always has a cold. You don't get any sun. And in the winter it's always the same story. I don't like the sun. But you need it. You were born premature. You were smaller than the other babies. 2 kilos and 300 grams. How much do I get if you're wrong? Gently! Always covered in scratches! Dad! Well, Dad. Are you chicken? You're a loser. 2 kilos 300, don't you remember? More sausages? It's in my album. Born August 11 at 10 p.m. Enough! Give me peace! You've lost. Go on, humour him. 2 kilos 300! Happy now? Dad. You're growing up too fast. Where did you hide it? Can't you see l haven't got time? How did you get it? You know damn well I need it! - I can imagine. - You can't imagine anything! Never forgets a thing. 2 kilos and 300 grams could be. Colour of people's eyes, faces, names, dates. - Blackie! - Are you a stray, boy? - Blackie! - Comes around. We feed him. Keep quiet! Don't come out in the cold. How long is the treatment? It's a lot of money. What did you do with my letter? Did you read it, at least? Two lines. You didn't have the guts to finish it? You're not an orphan yet. Never mind... Don't pity me nor yourself. Doctor, doctor Make me sleep Flowers of all colours Walking with you in the garden Where the fuck were you? You know the time? And hand in hand Two guys came looking for you. Friends of yours, they said. I have no friends. You don't say... How am I going to deliver 5000 tapes with these two clowns? Don't you know it's almost Christmas? 300 pesetas... It's a big rip off. Are you in pain? In Lisbon? You have it all well planned. Everyone's asking me if you're better, when you're coming back. I'm tired of making up stories for you. Can't you see that Nino is scared? You know what he hears at school? And now all this money. Where's it coming from? This time I won't let you go. Save me! You're the only one I trust. We're going to get lost. I can't see a thing. It's a bad night. If the moon was out we could see the river. How do you know? don't. I'm just talking. Vicente... We won't find an open one. We'd better stop. It's so cold. Vicente. Let me do it. Can't let him go like that. Clara, what's wrong? - We've broken a vase. - It doesn't matter. Don't cry. You hardly knew him. It's not for him. If they see us like this they're going to think that. Don't... Wait for that cloud... and close your eyes Did Dad look at my album? I left it in his bedroom. I won, he owes me. What did you say at school? Nothing. You said Dad had gone away? Yes. Try to close them tighter... Everything. Nino, Dad's not coming back. Not coming back? Now we can do what we like. Come to the markets with me. We'll never see him again? Nino, haven't you got any homework? Are you sad? I went to Tahiti To see Ann Marie Shut up! She lives around the corner Beside the bakery Arithmetic? I'm good at sums. Having problems? If you help me pack all this shit I'll help you with your sums. Free! Super Spanish computer. Multiply And divide Add And subtract It's as easy As singing Nothing. A letter. Who to? To us. - What are you doing? - It was to be a surprise. Now you can give us a hand. I don't know. You're strong. Were you not strong? When you were my age? We still haven't got any letters. Soon. Dad won't forget. Do you think if someone saw us now they'd believe you were my brother? We're brothers... Forever. But nobody would guess. Everybody knows. We're always together. I take you to school, pick you up. But how? Right. What will I wear? Just like us. Vicente, do you know what the greatest human invention was? Aren't you going to the fairground? You didn't come yesterday. The teacher was asking about you. I had things to do. I couldn't come. You've changed. Can't you go on your own? You don't get it. This is something between me and him. Come, I want to show you something. Tell me. Stop! Not another step. That tree is haunted. What'll happen if I go near it? What do I do now? I can't say. I'll risk it. You're scalding hot! Go on, tell me everything. ''A man with a thermometer in his hat'' It's my composition. What about? - ''A Dream I Had'' You can't hand this in. Say you didn't dream of anything. Alright? Only if you tell me your secret. It was a long time ago... ... it was your brother teasing me. we always went home this way. He'd scare me if I didn't give him a kiss. This tree... And now, are you still scared? We'll be friends yet. The days pass and not a word from you. Worse. - My father hasn't come back. - Careful. Somebody might get hurt. - What do you want from me? - Can't you guess? A pine tree for my brother. How sweet, a Christmas tree. Which one? A big one? Until your father shows up we'll be dealing with you. - Hands off! - Come on, we'll help you. What about this one? Don't be so bashful. Pick one! Your father was a sick man. It happens that he had He was to pay up three days ago, but nothing... We came to collect. Here, for example, it says cancer. Keep still or l'll cut your ear off. Well? You're going to wear it out. If you want to change your life: first cut your hair, change your face. Let's see what he thinks. Well? Notice anything? - Didn't I tell you to wait for me? Call that a Christmas tree? you wouldn't walk home alone. I didn't have the last class... I was fed up. It's my fault. - We had a chat on the way. - Don't ever do that again. Go away. Don't hide. What if he finds out? Can you imagine? What about me? Why did you run away? I was afraid. Of me? Without you I can't. Don't leave me. Talk to me. Ask me what I did today, yesterday and the day before. Today I went to school... It was sunny in the playground... I dozed for I don't know how long... I thought it all hadn't happened... That you hadn't asked me anything and I was afraid. Nothing happened. Don't forget that. Look at me. I can't go through with this all alone. Clara! Vicente! - Who is it? - My uncle from Lisbon. - I'm going. - No! Stay. What's wrong? Don't you remember me? No... I just wasn't expecting you. It's Christmas. Can you tell me what this is? It came yesterday. I was going to tell you. - You didn't tell me that my own brother... - Lies, darling. - What happened? - I only know what's in the letter. Does Nino know? This is a fake! ''A friend of the family who means only well...'' What friend? Tell me! "passed away today at 3.00 p.m... ln this time of grief..." It's not even dated! "expenses for removal of the corpse... having no money on him..." Nothing else. You just forgot to sign it. You or the Devil! - What do you know? - Leave him out of it! What do you want? Money? These expenses? Here! Take it! Keep it! You wrote this letter, didn't you? Come Nino, let's wash your hair. You slut! What did you expect to get out of this? He left without a word. He can't stay here a minute longer! Neither will we! Will we have time? I'll look after you. It's his. It's pretty. It's too small. It's pretty. Bags. It's the children. I don't know. Ask me things. You're trembling. Closer. Closer. My body's gone all limp. Numb. I'm lost in a big maze Searching low and high In every street I lose you I find you. Is he serious? Sort of. You and Zeca? Why not? Water under the bridge... You and Zeca? Don't be stupid! The mist. Nino's so tired. They're getting suspicious at school. He misses classes. He has changed so much, they're beginning to wonder. We shouldn't have left him on his own. Vicente? Clara... I fell asleep. What did I say? - Dino's a big boy now. - Nino. What about his clothes? We'll manage. - We pulled it off, then? - Yes, we did. Did what? This is it! Your new home! Like it? Takes care of your cousin Pedro when I'm at the office. Here's the TV and the video recorder. You can watch cartoons as much as you want. The bathroom, like all others. And this is Pedro's room. Now, it's yours too. Aren't we sleepy, then? This is your cousin Nino. He's here. Don't be shy! Come in! Pedro's like that. He's a bit different. He always looks at people like that. He's very quiet but he likes you. See why I'm happy? Don't be afraid. It'll be odd at first but you'll get used to it. No! Who is it? Wrong doorbell. Nino? Call you father! Even if one of us dies, the other one will still get you! Don't see no difference! I didn't run! You're just a kid. It's not worth the pain! - Where is it? - I told you I don't have it! Who is it? No business without respect. - Who is it? - Open up, please! You really think they'd believe you? They're all afraid. Especially of somebody like you. Open up! I live in 3B. Let's move. Eduardo? Do you like them? No, get out! Try them on anyway. No. How about the zoo? Then let's stay in town and do some window-shopping. What do you like? Nino... Don't be sad. Clara? Now what's wrong? Don't you think you're better off with us? He never sleeps. It's his sickness. Your brother is sick, too. But his sickness is worse. We can't live with him without all of us being sick. Don't you like the fish? Your brother would kill me given half a chance. Do you know what you're saying? It's your fault I'm like this! - It was Vicente. - Because I wanted to help you! Try to understand! We don't need help! Want a closer look at the prehistoric monsters? Do you? Better now? - The kid's a tough nut. - Like father like son. It's a fucking nightmare! Little liar! Cut the TV! Check the accounts, put 2 and 2 together... 3 days left... Son of a bitch! Vicente... Can you hear me? I'm here. Don't be afraid. - Unbelievable! - See how she treats him? You must be hungry. The man has blinded you. Bring me a tin of tuna! You're not a pretty young thing anymore, love. Miss Portugal 1950 routine! Don't try to speak. Rest. Later you can ask all the questions. The woman's gone mad! We'll be asking the questions! What you did was wrong! And bringing him to my house... Our house! Don't forget that! There were four of us at the start, there will be four at the end! Got it? Let's have a little s?ance. I'm sorry. Someone might respond. Someone always responds. - Let's go to bed. - Who could we contact? A certain union man... sickly... Sentimental... - Stop it for Christ's sake! - See what you've done? - Calm down. I only did it to save him. Just for him. Hands off me, you pig! I can feel a presence... Slight... Come have dinner. Don't worry, I won't run away. Vicente is on his way. Get down here! You better get used to it. We'll have to eat out as long as C?ndida is sick. But food is the same everywhere. Like it? What? It's not poisoned, don't worry! What a mess! Nino, eat! He looks as if he's blind. Pedro isn't blind. And if he were? One for daddy... One for mummy... And one for... I'm not his cousin! You're his cousin, you're my son, you're what I say you are! If you lived with your brother, I shudder to think... I'm going deaf thanks to him. Vicente will be here any minute now. - What have you been writing there? - Prices. But I don't remember your face. And I never forget anything. Get yourself a drink. I never have guests. How long have I been here? You had me scared. But it's alright now. You look better. You were sweating so much. - I'll get you a pullover. - I don't need anything. - I'm going. - They've locked us in. Do you want to see him? It's my father you want, isn't it? Let me go. I'll take you to him. If I fall asleep, And this when he arrives... I'll count to 100 and my brother will be here. He could be your son. The same eyes. Quiet, the children are sleeping. Children... You're so pathetic! Gently... 86, 87, 88... 89... ...98, 99 100. Vicente. I've come to get you. It's too late now. Let's find Vicente. It'll just be the three of us, like before. You never told me your secret. No... Our secret Are they the same? Where are you going? I'm going home. Are we going to your house? I begged him so many times to take me there. I'd like to meet Nino. Can't you go any faster? He never talked about me? How is he? - We're not going to make it. They thought it all up, planned it all. He said it would work. I was so scared. Your father was getting worse. I went along with it to save him. But things never work out the way we plan them. It started out with some of membership fees and donations... Not much, really. They collected, we kept the books. Then it became too easy. They're ruthless. Your father is afraid of them. We have the money. Vicente? Clara... How old are you? 12? - 13? - 10. Do you know what the greatest human invention was? You know? I swear I don't. - You won't get lost? - No. I'll just take a little nap.
