OPERA Why am I, as opera composer, drawn to the classics? That started in my childhood. As a child I enjoyed playing the classics, e.g. Hopscotch. I liked to drink tea, naturally, with pie, especially with baisier. From here: sublimation of childhood associations, attraction to Tschaikovsky, Bizet and so on... As some classic said: you have to take folk music and just work it over. That's exactly what I'm doing. So, when you take music from some composer nowadays, you take from the folk, when you take from the folk, you take from yourself. from yourself And the main thing is that music must be yours. And if someone says: plagiarism, I tell him - tradition. Oh, you dear field grass of mine, Oh you dear rabbits' corner We're sure that sooner or later little hare will go for a walk in the meadow. One, two, three, four, five... [he] went [for a walk] I went for a walk in the wood, I'm scared and I'm afraid My soul is full of foreboding! Full of foreboding is my soul!

I didn't eat the carrot! - I challenge you to a duel! - I accept! Now someone's blood will spill! Now someone's blood will spill! Now someone's... Someone's... Someone's... Oh, will my cross-eyes now be closed forever? - Now it will happen, blood will spill! - And I will never see you, my love? - My love... - Now it will happen... My love... my lovely carrot! I'm forever yours, my lovely carrot! Now it will happen, in a moment... A moment... Pif! Paf! Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy-oy! My little hare dies. I shall be carried home... I'll turn out to be alive.
