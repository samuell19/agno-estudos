[orchestral music] [exhales] [music stops] [dramatic music] (male #1) 'Alright, kiddo, right this way.' 'Here we go.' 'And up!' And in you go. - Hey, watch your step. - Yeah. Yeah! [sighs] Alright, we're off. [chuckles] [lift creaking] Building needs a hell of a lot of work, hell of a lot of work. But the, uh, the one up top, it's...good shape, good shape. We wired it. Got new plumbing in there. Roof, tight as a drum. We even got one of 'em... low-flush toilets, you know? - Ever seen that? - Mm-hmm. Here we are. We're at the top. Don't go any higher. Alright, watch your step there. [keys jangling] Right down the hall here. [panting] Seems like a really nice building. And quiet. Oh! Yeah, yeah. Nice and quiet. Yeah. Here we go. [keys jangling] [chuckles] Ah! Here we go. Come right in. Here she is. It's beautiful. Oh! So, it used to be a warehouse, huh? 'Yeah, back in the '30s but uh' 'they shut it down before the big war.' (male #1) No! That.. Uh, excuse me! This is, uh.. That's a closet. [chuckles] Nice place to hide your skeletons. Say, where does this go? That goes absolutely nowhere. Nowhere? I don't know. I never got a key for it. Probably some old storage room or somethin'. There's no bedroom in here, huh? Hey, you don't need a bedroom. Not in a place like this. You really did a fantastic job, Mr. Rouark. Thank you. Now, uh, back there, you got your dressing room there's your kitchen, and over there is your reading room. Reading room? Uh, some people call it a bathroom. (Karen) 'Jerry, look at this view.' Oh, it's fantastic. (Rouark) You know, here it's sunny even when it's not sunny. [chuckles] You got a great view of the Hollywood Sign. When they built this place Hollywood Sign used to say, "Hollywood Land." 'Now, it just says, "Hollywood."' 'I don't know why they changed it.' 'So what do you think, kids? You want it?' Got your lease. 'Finally got your lease.' All standard. No big deal. We just sign at the bottom? Yeah, any damn place along there. Yeah. Alright. - So, it's official? - It's official. [chuckles] It's official. Hey, you're an artist, huh? - Yeah. - Lotta cash, does kids' books. Oh, well, maybe, I ought to get a couple of your books for my grandkids. - Yeah. - Okay. First of all, I better get some grandkids. [laughing] What's your line, kiddo? Jerry's a photographer, a great photographer. What kind of stuff? Oh! You don't do them, uh, nudie things, do you? Uh, yeah. Actually sometimes. Oh.. Excuse me? Where do you want the bed? [thunder rumbling] [moaning] Come on, baby. Get on the top. - No, uh.. - On top, baby, come on. Jerry.. Baby, come on. On top, please. [continues moaning] Come on, baby. (Jerry groaning) [breathing heavily] It just hurts sometimes. - Ah, did I say anything, huh? - No. Alright. Look, I know it's a touchy subject, okay but do you think that maybe once in a while we could do something different. Maybe? Even if it hurts. Why don't you punish me, sweetie? Come on, tie me up. Huh? Make me beg. Yeah, right! You can still tie me up. Please, just get on top. Come on, baby. Just once. (Karen) It's just.. It just hurts sometimes, I know. It hurts sometimes. Look.. Baby. There's something we can work on, you know? It doesn't have to hurt. Sweetie. Last thing I want is to hurt you, you know that, right? I know. It's just, some things are hard for me. Yeah, me too. [kissing and giggling] [rain pouring] [dramatic music] [eerie breathing] [hissing] [dramatic music] [crows cawing] [rattling in distance] What is that? [rattling continues] [rattling grows louder] [squeaking and rattling] [rattling stops] (female screaming) 'Help me! Help, help!' 'Help me! Help me, please!' 'Help me! Help me!' [crying] [breathing heavily] Mr. Rouark? It's Karen Cabey. - Something's goin' on here. - What's that? [Karen on phone] 'Can you come over?' - What did you say, kiddo? - What's that, kiddo? Will you shut up? - Can you come over? - Alright, I'll be right there. What's that, kiddo? Big mouth. So...what do you say, you heard some squeaking? Well, that's how it started and then, I heard this pounding and...then it sounded like screaming. Screaming? Yeah, but it just stopped when I got on the phone with you. Well, let's go see what's behind door number one. [footsteps] Hello! [tapping] [creaking] [grunting] Come on. Art, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. - 'Sure?' - Yeah. Here, give me that. Stay with me. 'Ho-o-ly shit!' Ho-o-ly shit! Fuck. What the.. Oh. Son of a bitch. Here. Well, I just about... messed my pants there, kiddo. I thought that thing was made out of pure gold. [chuckles] Well...I don't think anybody could have got in here. No window. Door is shut tighter than a nun's ass. Excuse my French. You're right, nobody could have been in here. Jesus, would you just look at that. [sighs] I know, look at it. Fix it up a little, could be gorgeous. - Gorgeous? - Yeah. Why would anybody wanna hide something like this? I don't know. [electricity fluctuation] [pop music] [camera clicks] Alright, sweetie. Don't pose, okay? Remember, don't pose, alright? It's a comfy bed. Bed here is the star. The bed, okay? So I need you to take a deep breath and relax. Alright? Okay, I'm sorry, what's your name again? Cassandra. Cassandra, I think you're overdoing it just a bit. What, this doesn't look relaxed? It's beyond relaxed here, okay? It's a comfy bed, so I need you to show me how comfy it is. 'Comfy bed. Not a coffin.' Just give me comfy. Yeah. Look at that. Remember, the bed's the star here, okay? * Aces four, pal, how bout you? * * I'll tell you in a minute or two * * Right now gotta have a.. * Why would somebody hide this? I mean, it is weird that somebody would forget about something like this, isn't it? It's so soft. Touch it. [piano music] I-I gotta go. Mr. Rouark? [door closes] [camera clicks] We're finished? We are. This is fucked. They are never gonna buy these. We're gonna have to eat it. - 'Re-shoot?' - 'Yeah.' This time, give me a model that's...maternal, okay? - More Aunt B type? - Don't be ridiculous, huh. But maybe give me someone that actually sleeps on a bed. Hey, Karen? Karen? Hey, this thing won't open. [banging] It's open. Whoa! Do you like? 'What is this all about?' You're surprised? Uh, yeah. (Karen) 'Come on, baby.' Where did this come from? There. From behind the door that goes nowhere? Why don't you take my picture? Take my picture. I wanna pose for you. 'What's the matter?' Nothing, it's just not like you. I thought this is what you wanted. I'll get my camera. (Karen) 'How about this?' (Jerry) 'Yeah.' This is incredible, baby. You look amazing. So you like? 'I like, I like.' It's taking a little getting used to, baby. Well, does this help? [moaning] [moaning loudly] [breathing heavily] What are you thinking? Tell me. Er, actually.. ...I was thinking how lucky I am. Hmm. You don't know how long I've been wanting to do that, baby. I know, baby, I know. I love you. I love you. (Jerry) 'I feel like a door's been opened.' [birds chirping] [telephone ringing] [answering machine] 'Hi, you've reached Jerry and Karen's place.' 'Please leave a message at the tone.' (female #1) 'Hi, Karen, sorry to call you so late' 'but I just got this great assignment for you.' 'KahlemPublishing is doing a book about natural childbirth' 'and they want a scene in the late 1800s.' 'You know, something with one of those old-fashioned iron beds.' 'You think you could come up with something? Call me back.' [piano music] [telephone ringing] Hello. (Jerry) 'I cannot get last night out of my head.' Jerry. 'I can barely walk. What did you do to me?' You know, I.. It's weird, I thought I saw.. 'What? What?' Nothing. 'Hey, so any plans for tonight?' No. I might have to work though. That call last night was about an illustration. 'Hey, great, huh?' You're not gonna believe what it's about. - 'Tell me.' - Mm-mm. I'd rather show you. Show and tell, huh? 'I have so much to do. I have to get back to work.' Yeah. Let's say, last night really was great, huh? 'Yeah, it was.' She's ready. - Okay, I better let you go. - 'Okay, honey.' Keep it warm for me, huh, baby. 'Okay, I'll see you later.' Okay, bye. Keep it warm for me, baby. Screw you, girl. No. Thanks though. We're ready here? Let's do it. - So you're ready to work? - Absolutely. Okay, I guess Glory told you. The bed is the star of the show. Yes. So what we need from you is something that shows me just how relaxing that bed is. Okay, that shouldn't be too hard. Great. Like this? Aah, no. Try this. Like this? No. - More like this. - Alright. Alright? Let me see you arch your back a bit. That's right. Now spread your legs, see if you can reach the corner. You can't shoot her like this. Why? It look's like she's tied to the bed. Maternal, remember? Very maternal. This bed was a godsend. By the way, I...I got something for you. Huh? I have to say, I think they came out rather well. I can't believe I did this. [giggling] 'What's this, right here?' Yeah, that white, I don't know, you know. It's in the others too. I think it's probably like a light leak or maybe it's just the film. Other than that.. Other than that, they're perfect. They're you. [moaning] Ah. [moaning continues] [breathing heavily] [dramatic music] [panting] [breathing heavily] (Karen grunting) Oh. Oh, my God. Jerry. I'm so sorry. Oh, my God. Why'd you stop? I mean.. I was gettin' into it. 'Ugh.' [whisper] 'Help me. Help me.' 'Help me.' [gasps] Help me. Please. Aah! Oh, my. Oh, shit. (Jerry) Shit. What the hell was that about? Jerry, Jerry, somebody's in here. - There was somebody. - Who? Who? She was right there. - Who you talking about? - Somebody was in here, Jerry. - Come on, come on. - No, somebody's here, Jerry. (Jerry) What are you talking about. (Jerry) There's nobody here, sweetheart. I swear.. Maybe.. Maybe you were still asleep, yeah? - You think? - No. I wasn't asleep. I was drying my hair in the bathroom. I don't know. You know, you really haven't gotten used to this place yet. Maybe...it's just that. You know, the best thing might just be to go back to sleep. Okay? I don't wanna go back to bed again. I got an idea. Maybe you make yourself some hot chocolate? That always helps you go to sleep. I'll just wait here for you, okay? [birds chirping] [alarm] Jesus. Hey. What you doin', huh? 'What are these?' I don't know. Come on. What are they? I really don't know, they just.. They certainly are weird. God, I gotta go, baby. I'm late. I'll see you tonight, huh? Okay? Yup. [commotion in distance] You okay? Oh. Yeah, I'm fine. Hope I didn't disturb you, I'm just trying to get this.. No. It's fine. Do you want something to drink? Coffee, cup of tea? Well, ah...you have something cold, yeah? Juice? Well, I was thinking more in the line of a brewski. So, how is this damn thing treatin' you? You know, I've been thinking. Why don't you just keep the damn thing. I mean, I got no use for it, and you found it in the first place. Keep it? It might be worth something though. Look, kiddo, I mean. This thing ain't exactly my style. 'You know, I mean, these metal beds are kind of spooky.' 'Reminds me of a hospital.' I don't know what to say. Well, I'll be saying thank you. I got to get back to work. Oh, one thing. Um, I was wondering. Would you happen to know if there were any murders here? Murders? Not recently. Maybe in the '20s? Oh, cripes, kiddo, how old do you think I am? Is there any way of finding out, maybe? I don't know. Could you try? Yeah. I guess. But why you wanna find out something like that? Oh, I've this friend she's doing a book on gang wars of '20s and you mentioned how this might have been a bootlegger's place. I'll check it out. Okay. Thank you, Mr. Rouark. And it's Art. That mister stuff is much too respectable. Thank you, Art. I'll see you later. Oh... don't let the bed bugs bite. [both chuckle] - Bye. - 'Bye.' [keyboard clacking] [telephone ringing] [answering machine] 'Hi, you've reached Jerry and Karen's place.' 'Please leave a message at the tone.' (female #1) 'Karen, hi, it's me.' 'Have you finished that child-birth thing for Kahlem?' -'They keep calling me--' -Hello? - Yeah, I just got in. -'Is it finished yet?' - It's finished. Mm-hmm. -'Can you send it right away?' Yeah. I'll get it out tonight. - Okay. Bye. - 'Okay. Bye-bye.' Shit. [music turns on] 'Help.' 'Help.' [gasping] [music from gramophone] [dramatic music] [mouthing] No. [softly] Help me. Ssh-ssh-ssh. [telephone ringing] [ringing continues] Hello? [dial tone] Hello? [gasps] [yawns] [gasps] [softly] Help me. [screaming] Karen. Baby, what's wrong? Baby. You okay? Hey, Karen? [stomping] (Jerry) Baby, what's the matter? What are you doing? Baby, what's wrong? What? I didn't draw this. You did draw this. Okay, baby, so you didn't draw. What are you screaming about? I mean, I drew it, but I didn't draw this. [breathing heavily] I wanna get outta here. 'What?' I don't wanna be here anymore, Jerry. 'What are you talking about?' I didn't draw this. Look! (Jerry) 'A ghost?' Karen, a...a ghost? I don't know what it is. I just know something's here and I don't wanna be here anymore. But this place, baby, is perfect, okay? We've been looking out for a year, right? And this place is perfect. Plus the fact we've signed a lease. We can't just break it. He could charge us for a whole fuckin' year. I don't care, Jerry. I can't be here anymore. You can stay if you want to, but I can't be here. [sighing] Hey, hey. [sighing] Alright, look, you...been under a lot of pressure, yeah? I mean, moving, that's a lot of pressure, right? But before we do anything rash, I mean, would you mind going and talking to Carla? Your shrink? Hey, look, I mean, just talk with her, okay? If anything, she's a neutral party. Alright. If you talk with her and then you still feel like you wanna move.. Look, just-just talk with her, okay? Go with me? Of course, I will, baby. Of course. [dramatic music] [crow cawing] (Carla) I know you don't believe you drew these pictures but they had to come from some place. I think they came from a place you're not remembering and I think hypnosis can take us there. Karen, let me ask you a question. - Have you ever been hypnotized? - Hypnotized? You don't have to do it if you don't feel comfortable. No, it's not that. It's just.. I've never been hypnotized before. It's perfectly safe. It's just a relaxation technique. I've done it. - You have? - Yeah. Now, don't feel pressured. No, I want to. I know they came from somewhere. [sighs] When I count to three, you'll be asleep. [bells tinkling] (Carla) 'One.' Two. 'Three.' Asleep. 'Karen, can you hear me?' Yes. 'Alright.' I want you to just feel relaxed. 'And peaceful' and let your mind drift backward to the first time you saw the apartment. Yes. 'What do you see?' 'What attracts you?' 'What are you feeling?' - Bricks. - 'Bricks.' 'Why bricks?' Safe...can't follow. (Carla) 'Who can't follow?' 'Karen, who can't follow?' He can't, he can't, he can't follow. (Carla) 'Alright, Karen, alright. Just breathe.' Relax. [sobbing] 'You're perfectly safe.' Feel the bricks, Karen? 'When I count to three, you'll wake up' 'and you'll remember everything.' But you won't be afraid because you know you're perfectly safe, yes? Yes. 'Alright.' One. Two. 'Three.' 'Awake.' Karen...do you want Jerry to leave the room? What are you remembering? My, um, my parents divorced when I was 11 and I went to live with my mom at her parents' house. [sobbing] My mother's brother still lived at home. Can you go on? Do you wanna stop? [sobbing] My uncle would...he would sneak into my room at night. He...he had these.. ...handcuffs. These toys.. It didn't last long though. He got really drunk one night, and he drove right into a tree. [crashing] It was a county road, so...the steering wheel trapped him inside the car while it burned. While it was happening though, I had this hiding place in my grandparents' basement. 'They had this huge house with one of those gigantic furnaces.' The ones with all the pipes sticking out everywhere. And I could squeeze right through. 'Nobody else could get back there, and I would just' 'sit there for hours.' Right up against the bricks. I guess-I guess that's why I felt so at home in our new place because it reminded me of the away place. 'It's the place I called, "behind the furnace."' A place away from everything. A place completely safe. Sometimes stressful events will stimulate repressed or forgotten memories. It's quite common. Yes but.. Why would I be seeing her? Well, she's probably a projection. A kind of psychological escape valve. 'A way to put what happened to you outside yourself' but we'd have to do more than one session to understand it. You think about it. 'I'm going to write you a prescription for valium.' To help you sleep at night. Nothing long term. (Jerry) 'I love you so much.' I know. I love you too. If you ever wanna talk about what happened-- I know, I know. [sighs] When I think about.. ...what that bastard did.. The handcuffs.. [sigh] - What that bastard did.. - Jerry. Jerry, honey, can we not talk about this right now, okay? I just.. I wanna go to sleep. Yeah, fine. - Baby. - What? I just don't want anything like this to ever come between us. It's not going to, honey, okay? It's not. I just.. I wanna go to sleep now. Okay? Yeah, okay. Alright. [sighs] I'm gonna go get something to drink 'cause I'm thirsty. You wanna anything? No. [water running] [dramatic music] [music continues] [screaming] Jerry! Jerry, honey. [breathing heavily] Honey, wake up. You were having a nightmare. I was? Yeah, baby. You okay? [breathing hard] Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. Baby, what were you dreaming? I don't know. I never remember. Maybe it was those drawings that you've been drawing. Baby. I don't know. Honey...just get some sleep, okay? Okay. You'll be okay. [phone ringing] Hello? (female #1) 'Hi, Karen.' - Hi. - 'Where is the picture?' - Yeah, it's finished. - 'Oh, great.' Yeah, I just, I-I wasn't able to get it out last night. - 'Let me get back to you.' - I'll be home. - You will? Okay. - 'Yeah.' Well, then, I'll get it out later. - 'Okay, great.' - Okay, thanks. - Bye. - 'Bye-bye.' [sighs] [slow music] [computer beeps] 'Mail in your box.' [machine whirring] - 'Hello, Art?' - 'What's that, kiddo?' Oh, hi. Um, do you remember one night I asked you if there were any murders here? You're not gonna believe what I found on the internet. There were murders here. At least bodies were found around this building and the neighborhood. Bodies of seven women. They were all strangled. 'Seven unknown women were choked with neck ties' back in the 1920s and 1930s, but the killer was never found. Art? Art, are you okay? [gasps] [screaming] [bird screeching] [siren] [door closes] [footsteps] I'm gonna get something to drink. You want anything? No, thanks. [glass clinking] You know, I really don't think it's such a great idea to show those to the cops. You know, whoever killed those women didn't kill Art. He'd have to be a 100 years old. Yeah, but.. Well, the detective did say that maybe he could be a copycat. Yeah, he also said people don't copycat 80-year-old murders, didn't he? [sighing] Maybe, I should've shown him some of these. Come on, Karen. What's that gonna prove, huh? [sighs] I don't wanna be here anymore. Cops said we can't leave. Leave town. He doesn't want us to leave town but I don't wanna be here anymore. Jerry, let's leave, please. I don't wanna be here anymore. I can't stay here another night, not after what happened. Can you? Yeah, you're right. [clock ticking] Let's blow this pop stand. [zipping] - Hey, Karen. - Yeah? Double check the dressing room. I think I got everything. Once we get outta here, I'll make sure we get off for good. 'Okay, I'll be right back.' [door creaking] What the fuck? [eerie music] (Jerry) What the.. How the hell did this get up here? [eerie music] [creaking] [screams] Jerry. Jerry. Honey. [door creaking] - Are you okay? - Sure. Why? Well, the door was shut. I was just double checking. So, we get everything? Mostly. Did you check the bathroom? - No. I thought you did. - Why don't you double check it? And make sure we never have to come back. Okay. Honey, please don't go back up there again, okay? - Please. - I won't. Not without you. [knocking] It's open. [door creaking] I made you some hot chocolate. What's wrong? It's just warm. Just the way you like it. Thought you could use a break. I worry about you, you know. God, Jerry, I love you so much. [sighing] Drink your chocolate. It's gonna get cold. [sighing] [phone ringing] [answering machine] 'Hi, you've reached Jerry and Karen.' 'Please leave a message at the tone.' 'Karen, hi. It's me again.' 'I'm just wondering what's happening' 'with the Kahlem illustration.' 'They keep calling me, and I haven't heard from you..' [sighing] Did you put something in the.. [sighing] I just want you to relax. [breathing heavily] Don't.. I don't.. Oh.. [breathing heavily] [dramatic music] (Karen) 'What?' 'Jer-Jerry.' 'What? No.' 'Ah. No.' You're exhausted. [breathing heavily] No. Oh. No rest out there. - 'Please.' - Shh-shh-shh. Ah! There's nothing for you out there. This is the place. (Jerry) 'Your away place.' [intense music] [choking] Jerry.. [choking] [creaking] Help me. Shh-shh-shh. No! [screaming] [screaming continues] [panting] Ah! Aah! [intense music] [screaming] [grunting] [choking and coughing] Aah! [growls] Karen. What are you doing to me? - 'What are you doing?' - Jerry.. [screaming] [sinister laugh] Shh-shh-shh. [choking] [shrill scream] [manic laughter] [breathing heavily] [chuckling] [melodic music] [panting] Ah. [moaning] [moaning] [kissing] [screaming] Shh-shh-shh. [giggling] [hoarse voice] Kiss-kiss. [laughing] [screaming] [melodic music]
