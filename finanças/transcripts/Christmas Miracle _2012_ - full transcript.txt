[Train whistle blowing] [Bell dinging] [Rain pattering] [Thunder rumbling] Okay, I just can't shake the feeling that we're forgetting something. For the millionth time, Mary, everything is fine. We took the donation boxes to the post office three days ago. They'll be there for tonight. And the newsletter went out just fine. Okay. [Breathes deeply] Excuse me. Matt? Matt, stop. It's broken. Can you fix it? I just need a second, sweetie. MATT: But what about the train? All right, come with me. That's it. Watch your step. Watch your step. Maybe if you can't fix it, we can call Daddy. You know what, Mr. Conductor? If you go to your room right now, I think I can make it work. You sure you can? Only if you scoot up there right now. Okay. Scoot. [Sighs] Sorry. It's okay, Mary, we were done anyway. Joe still at work? Uh, no, not exactly. Oh. Well...right. [Clears throat] [Chuckles] Nancy, come on, clearly you've guessed. Joe and I are separated. It's none of our business. Well, I've been married for 10 years, you don't think I've wanted to be separated? But you've got a little boy, and he needs his father. We should go. Sorry. I'm sorry. I've got a big mouth and I don't know when to shut it sometimes. Have yourself a merry Christmas. So, does everybody know? I don't know that they know. I mean, people talk. Yeah, I can't even go to the grocery store these days without somebody giving me a sad, lost puppy look. The butcher's been giving me extra meat for weeks. I just thought he was being a nice guy. Well, you know how small towns are. Well, nothing is official yet. We're just taking a break. That's all it is for now. But, he doesn't live here anymore. No. But, that's okay. I will be okay. We'll all be okay. All right, well, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thanks for tonight. [Door opens] [Sighing] [Door closes] MARY: You'll be here on time, right? JOSEPH ON PHONE: How do you do this thing where I say something and then you ask me the same question a minute later? I ask you more than once because you haven't come through more than once. You know that's the last thing I've ever wanted. Just be here at 7:00, please. I'll be there. Thank you. [Sighs] By the way, he destroyed your mother's vase today. What? How? Does it matter? Well if I was there... If you were here, Joe, we wouldn't be having this conversation. I'm only gone because... You're gone because you were as good as gone when you lived here. Every time I needed you with Matt you just weren't here. I had to make a living. Other people manage to make a living and still somehow find time for their family. Don't you think we should all be together, at least for tonight? He sees me all the time, he wants to see you. I think he deserves to spend tonight with you. I'm sorry... [Phone disconnects] [Thunder rumbling] [Monitor beeping] [Monitor beeping rapidly] [Flatlining] [Sirens wailing] [Horn blaring] I told you we should've flown. It's a three-hour drive, Madeleine. In this weather? We'll be lucky if it's a 10-hour drive. I can't wait to see the traffic once we hit the city. We just need to get back on the highway. We'll be fine. And how did we get off it again? The GPS was trying to get us there faster for you, Your Highness. Did I ask you to do that? I was trying to be nice. Hmm. Well, maybe next time you'll just ask me. I think next time maybe we'll tell your parents that we're seeing them on Skype. Ugh! [Sighs] Doesn't it feel weird? [Chuckling] Yeah. But a good weird. Yeah. Now people can send us mail that says Mr. and Mrs. Parr. And I'm warning you, I am looking forward to getting really, really fat. [Both laughing] I would still love you. Now, you're enabling me? I know. Babe! [Laughing] I would still love you. RADIO ANNOUNCER: And we have a weather travel warning in effect. The I-95 has been completely shut down due to a weather-related six-car pile up at exit 15, southbound. Highway patrol has set up a detour along back roads, but is advising commuters to avoid travel if possible. Snowfall is expected to continue through the night, with heavy accumulations. Hi, sweetheart. Yeah, I have no idea where I'm at right now. They've detoured me down some country road and I'm between towns, that's all I know. Yeah, believe me, as soon as I find a decent place to stop I'm all for it. Okay. All right, I love you too. I'll talk to you soon. Okay. Bye. [Wind howling] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [Tires screeching] [Grunts] [Honking] [Groaning] You all right? Yeah, yeah. You? Yeah. Hey, we gotta set up some flares before somebody else flies into us. Some kinda Christmas Eve, huh? Can't see to save your life in all this snow. Is there a town near here? Well, yeah, the town's quite a few miles that way, but it is way too far in all this. Joseph Wells. James Mason. Can we get a tow truck out here? Oh, I don't know, I doubt it. I mean, it's Christmas Eve. Would you wanna come out in all this? I wouldn't. Hey! [Honking] [Sighs] [Tires screeching] [Screaming] [Honking] Get out of the way! Where do you want me to go? I don't know! Oh! [Engine revving] [Tires screeching] [Turns off truck engine] What are they doing? Is everybody okay? All in one piece, it looks like. How far you figure the nearest town is from here? Far enough that walking is out of the question. Between the wind and the snow, you'd be lucky to make it in one piece. So we're totally stuck? There's an old church that way. It hasn't been used in a few years and it's not the Ritz-Carlton, but it's better than being out here. Yeah. Look guys, it's the only shelter for miles around. Well, car heaters aren't gonna be worth a whole lot in this cold, either. You should probably tell them that. You know, we should go talk to them. And then what? We'll be lucky if we can keep the car warm enough for just the two of us. Well, I don't think they're coming over here to snuggle with us, okay? Keep the door locked. Why? What if they try to steal something? We don't know those people. We have valuables in the car. Yeah, they came all the way out here to get stuck in the snow to steal your earrings. Ugh. How are you? Drake, shut the door! Yeah, yeah. Hi. Hey. Look, we're...we're headed to an old church. We're gonna try and take shelter there. Yeah, that sounds better than staying in my car. You might want to tell your wife that. Come on, they've... they've found a church. No! What are you... I'm... Fine. [Screams] Oh! Oh! [Groaning] What's wrong? I hurt my ankle. What happened? My ankle. [Groans] [Groaning] Oh! Oh, it's freezing! Give me my purse! DRAKE: Are you all right? Get your weight off of it. Keep your weight off of it. I'm trying, Drake! You're dragging me! DRAKE: Come on. Just lift your feet a little bit, come on. MADELEINE: I'm trying! All right. Take it easy. [Groaning] Go slow. Don't put your weight on it, all right? It will be all right. Once we get inside, we'll be fine. Yeah, yeah. Well, I wouldn't have twisted my ankle if you'd have let us stay in the car. You wouldn't have twisted your ankle if you weren't wearing three-foot heels in the snow. Oh, stop being mean! [Grunting] It's okay, I've got bolt cutters in the truck. Hey, wait for me. What if we get arrested? I think we'll be okay, babe. Oh, nice. Come on. Come on. Come on. Yes. Go. Thank you. There's a wood stove in the basement. It's probably our best bet. Down there. You've been here before? Yeah, this was our church. And now? Well, it's been closed for a long time now. Tenants went down, donations along with it. After our last preacher passed, William, lot of people just stopped coming. He really got the community involved. Mentored kids, even married my parents. Yeah, he was this church. DRAKE: It's just one night. It's all good. MADELEINE: Ow! All right, all right, easy. It's okay. Just keep your weight off of it. Oh, this is better than our car? Well, it's at least inside. You wanna go back to the car, I'll be happy to take you there. I'm going where the snow can't. Ow! Easy, easy, easy. Jeez Louise. All right, may I? Okay, be...be gentle. Okay. Are you a doctor? EMT. Well, I used to be, way back when. Are there candles down here? I don't see any, partner. They'll be upstairs. After you. I don't think it's broken, but it's definitely sprained. You're gonna have to stay off it and relax, okay? She's an expert at that. Oh, stop it! I'm not saying I told you so, but... But you're saying we should've stayed at the ski lodge. I am. Well, there's not much we can do about that now, so... Sometimes I wish you'd listen to me about that kinda stuff. Predicting the future kinda stuff? No, I just mean practical stuff. I'm not some china doll. And what does that mean? Just, sometimes I think you decide what we're going to do and then that's that. I always ask you. Yeah, and then ignore what I say. [Chuckles] Stop being silly. Hmm? So where were you headed? Moving. You? Just finishing an errand. I needed some tools from the next town over and I didn't want to wait until the day after Christmas. Plus, I thought I could beat the storm back. So, what do you do? I'm between jobs, that's why I'm moving. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't you want to keep... Shh! Shh! ...keep your feet warm? I'll pay your driver double! Madeleine, we... Okay, triple. Just... Please, just name your price. Ah! Philistines! Could you just... Do you wanna put... Are you gonna put the shoe on? Could you... Yes! [Mumbling] This is, this is gonna be a great Christmas Eve. Yeah, thanks to you. Fantastic. Ow! Well I don't know, just take your jacket and...and cover... Are you for real? Well, it's gonna swell up inside your shoe... Be quiet. Shh! ...and the problem is not gonna go away. My foot is cold, it's cold, like this basement. No, Dad, I wasn't driving. No, he wasn't texting. He's a good driver! I love you, too. No, no, I think we'll be okay. We're in some old church. Okay. Okay, bye. It was three years ago. They love you, you know that. Yeah, but only when I'm not driving. They just got really scared. The dude ran a red light. It could have happened to anyone. But you were on your phone and... Yeah, which had nothing to do with it. I know. I'm sorry. What? That was our first fight as a married couple. [Both laughing] I love you. You know that, right? There we go. Maybe luck is smiling on us after all, eh, brother? Maybe. [Cell phone ringing] [Beeps] Look, I'm sorry. I'm going to be late. Joe! We talked about this. Hon, my truck got stuck in the snow, I'm stranded at the old church. I'm just saying I'm not gonna be able to pick up Matt any time soon. The roads are way too dangerous. The best move is to wait until morning. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. It wasn't just me. A bunch of other cars got stuck too. You still there? I just don't know how to tell him, Joe, he's been looking forward to this all week. Can I do it? I don't want anyone to do it. You know what, Joe, we have to stop pretending that everything is normal. This is not some big game we're playing. It's just not fair to him. Mary, look, I'll make this... [Phone squelches] Mary? Joe? Hello? Joe... Hello? [Dialing] [Over answering machine] Hey there, it's Joseph Wells of Wells Contracting. I can't take your call right now, but if you leave a message. [Disconnects call] Found some. Oh, good. Candles here. Hi. How's your ankle? It hurts. Yeah? We just have to get some wood for the stove, guys. There's some dead wood out back here. We got a whole forest, might as well use it, right? Oh, yeah, worst-case scenario we could break down some of this wood right here. Huh. You're... You're joking, right? All right, I'll get some wood from outside. Guys, I got a hatchet in my truck, I'm gonna go grab it. That sounds good. Hey, you coming? No, I'd just get in the way. No, no, listen, no time to be shy. Let's go. How long you've been playing guitar? God, since I was a kid. You a singer, too? Well, just in the shower and on Sundays. Nobody's told me to stop yet, so... It's a good thing, right? Yeah. You a musician? No. No? Used to direct a choir. Hmm. [Doorbell ringing] Who's there? JENNIFER: Matthew, could you please let me in? My name's not Matthew, it's Matt. Okay, Matt. Matt! Matt! Hi. Hi, sorry about that. [Chuckling] It's all right. He likes to keep things interesting. Certainly does. Come on in. Hey. Oh! Thank you, Jen, so much for coming. Oh, no worries. Everybody's snowed in anyway so, it's not like I was going anywhere. Well, there's lots of food in the fridge. Can I have a snickerdoodle? You may have one, young man, and that does not mean five. All right? Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I need to talk to you for a second. I need to go out. But Jennifer said you couldn't. Everyone's snowed in. I'm not gonna be very long. Are you sure about this? Yeah. It's just, there's nobody on the roads, like, zero. Like zero. We paid a lot of money for that SUV out there, so I'm gonna find out how good the four-wheel drive really is. Okay, listen, your dad, he's out at the old church. Remember the old church? And he's stranded out there with a few other folks. And I'm going to try and get him. So, all I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna take some blankets and some food and then, I'm gonna come home. It's good to help people who need help, right? Dad's at the church? I thought he was coming home. Can I come? I'll help, I'll be good, I promise. You know what, sweetie, I need you to stay here with Jennifer, okay? I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I know how much you wanted to see your dad tonight. Don't you wanna see him? I do. Of course I do. Why would you say that? Just 'cause... Come on, give me a hug. Come on. Okay. But what about our gifts? Like, we always open them. Why don't you open one with Jen? I don't wanna open a gift with Jennifer. [Laughs] Thanks a lot, Matt. I only wanna open a gift with you and Dad. That's really sweet, Matthew. Tell you what, tomorrow we will open all of our presents together, I promise. Call me Matt. Bye, Mom. Bye. Okay. All right, please be careful. I will. Okay. I'm not gonna be long. Okay. Okay. All right, bye. Bye. [Car starting] DRAKE: You know, maybe if you didn't have to parade around in $1,000 shoes we could've flown, too. You have no idea the sacrifices that I have made for you. Right, sacrifices. Yeah, you... you keep sacrificing all the way to the bank. [Sighs] Fine. Oh, come on, honey. Fine. Ow! Don't get up. Come on, you've... Madeleine, come here, don't go up the stairs. MADELEINE: I can do it! Madeleine, don't go up the stairs with a twisted ankle. [Madeleine groaning] Promise me we'll never be like them. That's easy. We'll never have that much money. [Laughs] It's so much colder up there. Good, it'll help her cool down. That lady's uptight. I wonder if I should go talk to her. And tell her what? I don't know, we're both wives. [Laughs] It's not the same thing, babe. You think I couldn't possibly have anything useful to say to her, don't you? I didn't say that. No, but you were thinking it. Okay, whoa, let's not start that fight. I'm going. Look, she's a real adult, Christie, she's not gonna relate to you. I didn't mean... Christie... Hey. Hey. [Sniffling] Are you all right? I'll be all right. I won't be all right. [Chuckling] We used to be so happy. What happened? Money got in the way. It seems like you've got plenty of money. [Laughs] It's fake. Really? If I told him, he couldn't take it. He's very proud. We just don't need to spend that money, it's a waste. Even that? No, that's the genuine article. It's my wedding ring. You're so young. You must think your boyfriend's perfect. Husband. Women, huh? Yup. [Chuckles] Right? My advice, don't get married until you're at least 30. Longer, if you can manage it. Too late for that. Oh! How long have you been married? Three days. Three days? Well, shouldn't you be on your honeymoon? Technically, we kinda still are. Should probably spring for something a little nicer. [Chuckles] We were skiing up at Crystal Mountain, this was our drive back home. Tough luck. All this, you know, the storm, being stuck here... God, I wonder... I wonder if it's a sign. You know, maybe we rushed into this. The only thing it's a sign of is the weather patterns. Kid, don't let me bum you out, seriously. When you first get married, it's...it's great. It's like you're walking on air. Enjoy it. Everything all right with your wife? What, Madeleine? Ah. She's... She's like a tea kettle, you know, you gotta let the steam build before she whistles. Well, at least you guys got some money. That didn't sound good, I'm sorry. Sometimes I don't think before I talk. That's okay, it's all right. And we don't. You're probably a richer man than me. How? "How?" Well, that's a complex answer. The stock market plummeting and real estate values along with it. Your friends telling you about a great investment they have, you listening to them. [Chuckles] It all adds up pretty quick. Before you know it, you're living off of a dozen credit cards. Hmm. Does she know? Well, you know, she's gotten used to life being a certain way, right? Fancy car, house, shopping. But don't you have to tell her? Eventually. So far, eventually hasn't come yet, so... When it does? Oh, it'll crush her. That's why I want to keep eventually away as long as possible. Hmm. We... We need some paper or something flammable to get this stove started. Can you handle that, Nick? Yeah, of course. Good. [Grunts] Come on! [Engine revving] Come on, come on, come on. [Tires screeching] We are definitely not burning this. I agree. I haven't sat here in years. Been a while for me, too. It was really a beautiful place, if you could believe it. I mean, bit hard to tell now. No, I can tell. It's so easy to get caught up in life and forget the things that matter, you know? My wife, my son. I don't know, sitting here... I've made some mistakes, brother. We all have. I just hope I can fix them. I wouldn't bet against you. [Engine revving] [Tires screeching] [Sighs disappointedly] [Crackling] JAMES: Does God answer prayer? Does he even hear when we pray? Sorry, I've lost my... ...place. Who... Who do you call to... [Quivering] I've lost my place. [Banging on door] [Banging continues] [Grunting] Hello? Joe! JOSEPH: What were you thinking? I just wanted you to be with Matt. Besides, you said that... that SUV could handle anything the weather threw at us. You were kinda wrong on that one. Oh! He just wanted to see you so bad. I have... I have food and more blankets in the car. I'm the one who needs to go. You're probably right. Uh, Daryl, can you look after her? Yeah. Wait up, James! Thank you. What time does Christmas start? Well, it's Christmas Eve, so technically Christmas starts at midnight. What time is it now? Um, about 10:00. That means Mom and Dad are running out of time. What it means, is that it's past somebody's bedtime. Don't worry, I'll stay up and make sure they're okay. Okay. Good night! Good night. [Chuckles] JOSEPH: Sometimes I feel like the world just likes to test me. You ever feel like that? What? No? Well, my marriage is probably over and some days, I can't for the life of me, figure out why it happened. Answers don't fall from the sky, Joseph. Oh look, I knew we had problems, but you never think it will go to the next level. I just thought we were working through everything. If you want your marriage to work, do the things that made it work in the beginning. You ever been married? I have. Yeah, well, where is she? She's not here. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have pried. How much do you think those earrings cost? A lot more than I'll make any time soon. Why? What if I told you they didn't? How? Are they fake? Shh! He doesn't know. What is she doing buying fake jewelry? He's doing everything he can to keep her in the money. What? [Laughs] We... We have to tell them. It's not our place, seriously. Well, of course it is. What we should do is learn from them and always be honest with each other. We can help them. He didn't tell me for the whole world to find out. Well, neither did she. So? So now we have the chance to make them both happy. Yeah, or just really, really mad at us. Come on. Mmm-mmm. Bad news, trust me. Hey, Mary. Hi. How you doing? I'm okay, warmed up. Good. How long have you been a doctor? Oh, I'm not. I've wanted to ever since I was a little kid, but... So, what happened? Well, I studied. You know, I read those books backwards and forwards, and I knew it. At least I thought I knew it. And? Well, I flunked the MCATs so... Why do you think? It wasn't for knowledge, I... I have dyslexia. Oh, I'm pretty familiar with learning disorders, my son has autism. I'm really sorry to hear that. It's okay. But, my point is, there's lots of specialized tutors, people that can help you. It's not something you can't overcome. How many times did you take the MCATs? Once. Once? Yeah, just once. No, that's nothing. Look, I know a specialist, I can set the two of you up. You will be breezing through that test, I promise. No time at all. Well, you know what, I rode that horse and got bucked off, I... I don't think I can get back on. Oh, thanks. You always were a show off. Always try to impress. Come on, let's get you warmed up. Yeah. We have to tell them. Christie, this is beyond a bad idea. I never thought it would get this bad. No one did. Sometimes things just slip away right in front of you. Maybe it's not too late to fix it. [Chuckles] That would take a lot of work. I'm willing to try, if you are. Seriously? Hi. Hello. What's this about? Okay, so, I really didn't want to do this and I hope you're not mad at me but... You told me that you've been buying fake jewelry to save money, right? And he told Nick he's been giving you money that he doesn't really have, so, I just thought you should both know. So that you can work together... I'm... I'm sorry. [Groans] Are you mad? No, I'm... I'm just shocked. Madeleine, are you all right? Oh, God, I... [Groaning] What's wrong? I'm hyperglycemic diabetic. Where's your insulin? My purse. Stay with her, I'll find it. Yeah. And bring the doc! Hey, where's Madeleine's purse? Why? She just passed out almost, she needs insulin. Her insulin case isn't here. Does she keep it anywhere else? Uh... No. No. Okay, so what do we do now? I don't know, she's gonna need her insulin. What happens if she doesn't get it? Maybe acute hypoglycemia, maybe ketoacidosis... She needs to get her insulin. Well, if it's not in her purse then where could it be? I don't know, I can't think of any time she's kept it any place else. When she fell, did she drop anything? What does it look like? It's... It's like a black case. Well, if it's out here, it's buried. She had to wear heels, you know! I told her, it's going to snow. But, no... But Queen Sheba over there, she's... [Sighs] She's so stubborn! I... I love her for it, you know? [Chuckling] I love that she's crazy enough to wear heels in a blizzard. Isn't that silly? That's love. We were getting bored in there. I got it. Fantastic. Let's go. Let's go. [Groans] It's okay. It's okay. It'll be fine. It'll be okay. It'll be all right. It'll be okay. It'll be all right. MARY: He asked me today why I didn't want to see you. He's a smart kid. We've been really good about not fighting in front of him. I'm not there. That's what he's picking up on. I guess I was just hoping he wouldn't realize it all so fast. You know, this is the most I've seen you in weeks. It's nice. Yeah, I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. After the storm, they'll be cleaning up the town for a few days. I could take some days off and maybe I could stay at the house for a few days... I don't know if that's a good idea, Joe. Why can't we just try, just for a few days? So, is...is this just for show? No, sir. Well, it's Christmas Eve! I don't know about you, but I think a little music would go a long way to brightening things up. Well... [Chuckling] Are you gonna play? I guess I could play a little something. Great! Now, listen, don't go getting your hopes up. I ain't no Johnny Cash, so... [All laughing] Let's see what happens here.

Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas. Mom? Dad? Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas. Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas. Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas. Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas. Jonathan did not say that! Because he didn't! [Laughs] I don't know. Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas! Matt, what are you still doing up? Mom and Dad are gonna miss Christmas. No, they won't. The only person that's gonna miss Christmas is you if you don't get upstairs! They're gonna be home soon, okay? I promise. Now, go to bed. Matt's afraid they're gonna miss Christmas. [Mumbling] Okay, so, did Jonathan really say that? What? [Laughs] Really? Isn't he dating... No? Oh... [Laughs] All right. Okay, well, thanks for telling me. Okay! [Laughs] Definitely not steak, but it's still food. Thank you. I... I just, um... I want to tell you I think it's great that we're going to try a little. Joe... I'm happy that you wanna try, but I don't know how this is gonna turn out. I can't just flip a switch and make everything okay. Mary, I can... You know what, Joe? I walk down the street, everybody gives me these looks. Like, "Oh, there she goes, poor woman, "can't make her marriage work. "She's probably ruining her child, too." No one thinks that. They'd... Ugh! Drake... Why... Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't you? 'Cause I was afraid you'd leave me. And... What? That's what you think I am? Some sort of gold digger? No, it's just we...we've had money ever since we've been together. Ugh! I don't care about that. I enjoyed it, sure. But I love you. Not your money. Well, you're really gonna love me after you see our bank statement. [Laughs] [Sighs] [Train whistle blowing] [Blowing whistle] How you doing? Oh, I'm good. Fire warmed me up. [Train whistle blowing] Is that a train? [Bell dinging] In this weather? [Laughs] That's old Charlie. Thing's been running ever since I was a kid. Probably a little slow out there tonight, but he's still running. You grew up here? Mmm-hmm. Joe and I both did. Do you have children? Yeah, we have a son, Matthew. Loves old Charlie. Loves everything trains, but Charlie's the best. Probably because of the bells. Bells? Matthew has autism, and bells are something that he focuses on. Must be hard. Sometimes. But he's made a lot of progress since his diagnosis. That's good. [Softly] Yeah. I think it helped a lot that our last preacher here was so, so good with him. He was so kind. Do you have children? I lost my wife in childbirth. [Sobbing] It was a boy. God, I... I named him Anthony. God, I prayed and I prayed and I prayed. [Sobbing] I would've done anything. Nothing changed. I saw him for two minutes. I'm so sorry. God... I had an amazing wife. [Sighs] I'm sorry. It's okay. Maybe I'll just spend a couple minutes alone. [Sighs] [Exhales] CHRISTIE: See? You win. It's not a competition. Just remember that not everyone's so nice, that's all. What does that mean? Sometimes you're so nice, babe, that you put yourself at risk. Like when? Like, when you tried to give food to that homeless dude who was shouting at his bicycle outside our apartment. He was just lonely. He said the bike started it, that's not just lonely. You should've let me do it. But what if he hurt you? He wasn't going to hurt me. You know, you need to realize that the world is not bubblegum and sunflowers. You know, I really don't like it when you talk to me like I'm a 5-year-old. Well, sometimes you act like a 5-year-old. Okay. I am so bad at this. I don't know how you guys do this. I've been married three days and we have never argued this much. You are talking to the wrong guy. Your wife went through the snow for you, you must be doing something right. You love this girl, this wasn't some fly by night thing, right? Of course. Then whatever dumb thing you say, and trust me there will be plenty, just say sorry and hope she stops being mad. That's all you got? After how many years of marriage? Fifteen years, and yeah, that's it. You learn not to push her buttons. But it's all just educated guesses. Nobody really knows what to do, kid. Sounds tough. It is. Well, then, how do you make it work? I didn't. Oh, come on, man. She's wild about you. We're separated. I don't know any ex-girlfriend of mine that would go through a snowstorm for me. What's the problem? Just problems. Just tell her how you feel, I'm sure you can work it out. [Chuckles] This isn't high school. It's not that simple. Well, maybe you're just making it that way. MAN ON TV: Erin broke into the candy machine. Are you ready? [Airplane soaring] [Turns off TV] [Sighs] Matt? Matt? Matt! The 23-year-old told me I should tell you how I feel. I love you and I miss you every day. I do, too. So what are we doing? I don't know, Joe. I don't know. It feels like you use the business all the time to just run away when things get tough. Okay. Maybe that's fair. But don't you do the same thing with all your committees? It's not the same thing. Look, I get that it's not easy for both of us, I know. But you can't stand there and put this all on me, we are both hiding in our stuff. I just want us to talk to each other. I just want us to lean on each other when it's hard. I tried! But you don't wanna hear it. You wanna just pretend like he's a regular kid. He is a regular kid! No, he's special. And we love him all the more for it. It's just hard sometimes and that's our reality. [Softly] I know. He misses you so much. Don't... [Cell phone ringing] It's Jennifer. Jennifer? He's gone! What? I... I don't know. I went into his room and he's not in there. What? When? I... I don't know, I don't know. I... I know... I'm sorry. He's gone... Jennifer? [Sighs] JAMES: Matt knows that his parents are here, so it makes sense that he's headed this way. Madeleine will stay behind, the rest of us... Let's fan out and find him. Good luck! JOSEPH: Matt! MARY: Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! Matt! James, that boy is not gonna last long in cold like this. Matt! Matt! Matt. I'm sorry. That doesn't change how you think. I don't think you're a 5-year-old. Christie, I'm doing the best that I can. I know I don't always say the right thing, but... I love you. Really. I love you. Mary, Joseph. Hey, guys. Nothing yet? No. We've searched the whole area over there. Nothing. We'll find him. [Coughing] Daryl, come with me. We... We already searched over there. Come! MARY: Matt! Daryl, come with me! We'll find him! Come on! Come! MARY: Matt! God? Um... I know I haven't been to church in a while and we probably haven't talked in even longer. That's my fault and I need it to change, I know that. But that boy is innocent and I can't even imagine how his parents are feeling right now. So, if my words mean anything to you, please bring him home safe to them. Please? He wouldn't even be out here if I hadn't left him alone. Hey, look, look, look, look... We'll find him, okay? We will. We'll find him. Come on. Matt! Whoa! NICK: Matthew! CHRISTIE: Matt! Matthew! Matt! Matt! JOSEPH: Matt! Matt! Matt! You all right? Never better. [Bell tolling] JOSEPH: Matt! Matt? [Grunts] Matt! Matt? [Bell tolling] Matt! Matt? [Bell continues tolling] Matt! Matt! Matthew! Matt? Matt! Matt! MARY: Matt! Matt? Matt. Mom? Mom! Matt! Mom? Matt! MARY: Matt! Is he okay? Go, go, go, go! You are going to be okay. You are going to be okay. Daryl! We got him! Got to get him inside! [Bell continues tolling] James, they found the boy! Get him to the fire. Bring him here. Give him to me. Here ya go! [Chuckles] Matt... It's good to see that you're okay. All of you. Do I know you? [Laughs] I'm James Mason. It's nice to meet you. James rang the bell. You helped me. Well, I tried. Thank you. You're welcome. Daryl said he had moderate hypothermia. You probably saved his life. Well, I had help. We all had help tonight. And we got the best Christmas present ever. We forgot to open our gifts. Uh-oh. But I have a gift for you. Thank you. [Birds chirping] [Footsteps] Santa! Here you go. Thanks. [Dinging] Where did you find it? James found it in the preacher's chambers. [Laughs] We have a little Christmas present for you. A wedding gift. I want you to have it. Whoa. We... No way! We can't take this, Madeleine! You don't have a choice. We've been meaning to renew our wedding vows anyway. With a simpler wedding this time. Yeah. [Chuckles] Thank you. Mary told me about the MCAT. Oh, yeah. Well in my opinion, I think you passed this test with flying colors. If this doesn't show you what your calling is, I don't know what will. Well, I'm gonna call them tomorrow morning and reschedule the test. That's what I like to hear, Doctor. Thanks. I'm gonna grab a bite. All right. Great find with that bell, he loved it. Good. Looks like things are moving in the right direction for you guys. Yeah. Yeah, they definitely are. I'm glad. And we think maybe it's time to restore this old place. Really? Yeah. It's not a bad idea at all. Daddy. Remember our secret? [Whispering] Matty would like to give you something. He would? Here, so you'll always be able to let people know if you need help. Thank you, Matt. I love it. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It's very nice. You're very welcome. I've lived my whole life in Summitview. I married a woman from this great town and... and this is where we chose to raise our son, Matthew. I've always been proud of Summitview over the years. I never said it though. I just kind of thought people knew how I felt. After the death of our former preacher, William, we allowed ourselves to drift apart. We allowed this church to fall away from us and as a father and husband, I allowed myself to drift away from my family. What the events of last Christmas Eve here in this church taught me, when a bunch of strangers came together and took us into their hearts, and then helped us find our son when he was lost... Is that no matter how far you think you might drift from people, you can always find your way back home again. You just have to believe you can. And you have to let people know how important they are to you. Not just when things are good, but all the time. On, on that note, there's one person with whom I owe a special debt of gratitude. Without this person, I don't know if we would've found my son. He... He asked me to say a few words today, but I certainly can't do it as well as he can. So, James? Thanks, man. Thanks, buddy. Thank you, Joseph. Sounds like a natural to me, don't you think? And thank you for all of you who came this morning. This is a very special morning at Summitview Community Church. Because this is a service of rededication, of ourselves as a congregation, of this church building as a house of God, and also of the bell, which represents the voice of God, calling out and calling us in. In the New Testament, Jesus says, "Come to me all who are weak and heavy-laden "and I will give you rest." And that is the very true story of eight strangers who were stranded in a storm last Christmas Eve, who took refuge in this church. I was one of those eight and I can attest from the bottom of my heart, that we were lost, we were tired, and we were heavily burdened. And what I saw that night, was eight people come together with a spirit of kindness, spirit of understanding, support, ultimately, a spirit of love. Someone gave me a gift here, in this very church. He means me! I do mean you, Matt. This gift last Christmas morning. And I would like to personally dedicate this whistle as a permanent part of this church. To serve as a reminder of the love, and the community that exists here and also to serve as a reminder that it is never too late to start over. It is never too late, I know this, to find hope. And it is never too late to come home. Wells family, please ring that bell. [Softly] Go ahead. [Bell tolling] JAMES: Very good, thank you! We also have another surprise this morning. I'm very excited to say that we have a guest choir director with us. And not only is this man a great friend of mine and an incredible musician, but I have just learned that he is one of the newest medical students at Columbia. So please join me in welcoming and congratulating, my great friend Daryl.
