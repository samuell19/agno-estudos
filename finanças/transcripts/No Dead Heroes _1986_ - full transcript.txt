Damn it, James! Order a ceasefire on your fuckin' mortars. Move it! Incoming! What? You're hitting our area. One more time and you don't have to worry about the slopes. You'll be worried about me. Do you read me, James? [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] Very good. [IVAN LAUGHING] Help me out, please. [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] So, you don't wanna talk? You don't wanna talk to me? Talk! [GROANING] Which one of you is the CIA agent? You are the CIA. I'm not! [SPITS] Nobody spits on my face. Nobody spits on my face, God damn it! You son of a bitch, nobody spits on my face. Oh, there you are, men. We got a prisoner here for you, sir. Send him to interrogation. I need you here. You got new orders. Again? I thought we were supposed to be going on R and R in a couple of days. It seems that Mr. Baylor here is in need of our services. He's with the CIA. By the way, this is Captain Cotter, Lieutenant Sanders. CIA? What the hell is so important that brings the spooks down here to the end of the world? I'll let the CIA explain about that to you. One of our people is running an operation north of here. We kept in daily contact with him until yesterday. We have reason to believe he's been captured and taken to a POW camp. If I'm not mistaken, he's in your area of responsibility. What's that got to do with us? Mr. Baylor here has orders from the top to rescue and if necessary to terminate his agent under the guise of rescuing all the POW. Terminate? What kind of shit is that? COTTER: Correct me if I'm wrong, sir. But the camp you're talking about is Kobi-tan-tan and the commander there is a little sadistic bastard by the name of Colonel Minh. Right on both counts. Sir, Tien Kien Cao was at that area last month. He tells me it is a real butcher shop. They got a Russian adviser that's a little nuts, and most of the people going in are dead in a matter of days. Now, if you ask me, we're wasting a lot of time, not to mention lots of good lives. Besides, they've got a crack unit in that area providing security. Well, gents, orders are orders. But just for the fun of it, Mr. Baylor, what makes your agent so damn important that I should risk the lives of my men? The agent is not important. He knew he was expendable when he undertook the operation. It's what he knows. If my man breaks under interrogation, he could divulge certain information that would be very damaging in the United States. I'm afraid that I'm not in the liberty to let you know what that information is. Call that fuckin' James. He's at it again. Are you sure?I could kill that bastard. It's Charlie this time. I already checked it out. Get your equipment together. We move out immediately. We've got 24 hours to reach our objective. We'll pick you up at these designated coordinates. [WOMAN CRYING] You are a spy. You are an agent. If you're not an agent, what were you doing with the opium caravan? I'm an American soldier. Liar! Liar! If I say you're an agent, you're an agent. You understand me? If I say you're an agent, you're an agent. Comrade! One of them is a CIA. I don't care if I have to kill each and every one of them. Besides, according to the Geneva Convention, we can shoot spies. He was a spy. Bring the next one in. [CRYING] Pass the word for possible ground assault. Get moving! Sir. What? Air Cav says they ain't got anything available. Bullshit! You still get contact with them? Yes, sir. What do you mean you ain't got nothing available? I need that chopper at 0700. Say again? Okay, I'm coming over there personally. Osborne. OSBORNE: Sir. Get my fuckin' jeep ready. We're going over to Air Cav. OSBORNE: Yes, sir! And get some support from Charlie company. Yes, sir. Rover 6, Rover 6, this is Rover 2, you read me? No tying down! Orders. Fuck the orders. Get out of here. Move! Move! Where's that fuckin' chopper? Your guess is as good as mine. [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] Hey! Loading. [SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE] Shit. Fuckin' bastards. Move it, Sanders. Go. Get in. IVAN: So, Comrade, after so many failures do you think it'll work this time? SCIENTIST: We've improved it. The last prisoner that we implanted with it lived and he passed all the tests. IVAN: What's the procedure? SCIENTIST: The implantation is quite complicated. The process takes about 14 hours. We implant the chip into the base of the skull. Nerve endings are connected to certain terminals inside the chip. We also coat the chip with special solution to enhance the tissue growth. What do I use to control the chip? With this, we can control Comrade Cotter. If you were to depress this button, a small electrical current will be released into the central nervous system, and he'll follow the pre-programming of the computer chip. These buttons bring him back to normal. And this button, please notice that it's hard to activate. It will release a larger electrical charge to the brain, and Mr. Cotter will be rendered, as the Americans say, like a vegetable. Naturally, he's been programmed to kill. Naturally. What about his emotions? Don't worry. The chip will override nearly everything but the strongest emotions. You'll have to develop a method to overcome that situation. I have a man at Serbsky who can take care of that. But remember, there is a remote possibility of failure if the computer chip is damaged with a severe blow and becomes disconnected from the nerve. Let me tell you, Comrade, if this chip really works, there's no stopping me. I can even assassinate the U.S. president. What about your promise? Don't worry. I keep my promises. If this is successful, you will be appointed to the politburo including all the fringe benefits. But, if you fail, Comrade... Yes, if you fail, I'm afraid that you might meet with an accident. When he is able to travel, take him to the sanitarium outside of Moscow. And let me remind you, Comrade, no one must find out about this. Well, all I can say is, if you're gonna continue to stay out like that, you're not gonna go out anymore. Dad... [DOORBELL BUZZING] I'll get it. You should listen to your Dad. Hello. Can I help you? Mr. Sanders? Yes. We're from Mr. Baylor's office. He'd like to invite you for a little visit. Well, you tell Mr. Baylor I'm not interested, okay? Hold it. We're not finished yet. General Craig is with Mr. Baylor. General Arthur Craig? Yes. Yes, sir. Your commanding officer in Vietnam. CRAIG: Look, Frank, I let you use my name to get Sanders here in the first place. So, the least you can do is tell my why, after 14 years, you're so interested in getting Harry Cotter back from the Russians? I'm sorry, General. That's on a need to know basis. Need to know basis, my ass, Frank, we've known each other for years. You know what my security clearance is. Well, the Russians have been experimenting with new bioelectronics lately and our sources have it that they've perfected a device using microchips that can be implanted in the human brain and these chips can override the brain itself. Are you implying Harry Cotter got one of these things implanted in his head? Right, General. Why not just take him out? You guys definitely got the hit men to do it. We need to get Cotter alive so the boys in the lab can investigate this apparatus and see how it works. It's much more frightening than you think, General. How so? Just imagine if they could implant this thing into a close aid of the president of the United States or to a head of state, no matter where. Excuse me, sir, Mr. Sanders is here. Go right in. Thanks. Hello, Richard.Hello, General. Good to see you. How's the family? Good. Real good. Have a seat. Thanks. When did you start hanging out again with the spooks? Thought that wasn't your style. It's not. I'm just trying to make sure they don't screw up anymore than they already have. I presume you remember Frank Baylor. I remember Baylor all right. We lost Cotter on that big fiasco of his. BAYLOR: You know, I was just doing my job. I don't need this kind of talk. I'll come right to the point, Sanders. It's precisely about Cotter that you're here. What about Cotter? We have reason to believe he's still alive. Impossible! I saw him hit when he saved my life. I'm afraid that you're mistaken. Captain Cotter was merely wounded. You recognize the man there? The other man is Ivan Mitovich. The two were evacuated to Hanoi and then proceeded to Moscow. Cotter has been known to use several aliases. The most common is Andrei Zimmerman, a German national. It seems that these two are the perpetrators of a trail of international terrorism. If this is true, and I seriously doubt that it is, Baylor, what do you expect me to do? I'm out of the army now. I want you to work for us. I want you to find Cotter. Why me? CRAIG: I trained you and Cotter. You two and myself are the only survivors of that group. If this information is correct, and it is Harry Cotter that they have, I think you are the only man who has a chance to neutralize this. You'll have to give me some time to think about this, General. I'm afraid that time is the only thing we cannot afford to give you. Fuck you, Baylor. I'm not one of your pawns anymore. Okay, Rick, please make it fast. We don't have that much time. Hi. Hello. Did you have a nice day? So, so. Okay, let's hear it. I don't know, maybe I'm just tired. Come on. Let it out. Harry, Harry Cotter, they say he's still alive. The Russians captured him in Vietnam and they're making him do all these terrible things. My God. Does Julia know about this? No. No, I don't think so. Is that what those men came here for? The CIA wants me to help them catch Harry. Are you going to? I'm thinking about it. Harry saved my life. I owe him that much. Mom, are we going or not? Yes, so why don't you go change? Going where? Julia's birthday party. Oh, I forgot. Why don't you go change? No, I'm tired and I want to think. Why don't you both go without me? Don't say anything to Julia about what we've been talking about. Okay. You're sure you want us to go? Come here. [GUN COCKING] Happy birthday, Aunt Julia. Thank you. Happy birthday. Thank you. Here. Where's Bryan? They're in the patio. See you later, Mom. Okay. My, you look gorgeous. Thank you. How was your latest trip? Great. I've just arrived from Hong Kong. I envy you. The pleasure is temporary. I wish Harry was here to share this moment with us. [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Julia. Listen, happy birthday. I'm sorry I didn't get over there. I'm so tired and... Thank you, aren't you coming? No, Julia... Well, I won't take no for an answer. Okay. Just give me a chance to change and I'll be by. CROWD: ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you [DOORBELL BUZZING] ♪ Happy birthday, dear Julia ♪ Happy birthday to you [GUN COCKING] Oh, Jesus Christ. Harry, you're alive. My God, you were right, your Dad is alive. [CAR STARTING] CRAIG: Nothing I could possibly say would make you feel any better, Rick. I'm terribly sorry about your family. Just want you to remember, this mission is strictly top secret. On the record, you don't even exist. You will start intensified training program, 0600, Monday morning. [SOLDIERS YELLING] Soon, there'll be camps like this around the world, Comrade. I'm impressed with the methods. They've been carefully planned. You'd be surprised with the success we had with our Latin American camps. But they're nothing compared to the final plan. The plan is two-fold. First, to denounce these silly religious beliefs. Second, discredit the United States and the CIA. How? We're gonna disrupt the Pope's Latin American visit. Tell me, how long do you intend to stay here? For a few more days. Then you will still be here for the celebration. I expect so. Would you accept to be the guest of honor for our new graduates? Of course. Besides, Andrei needs more training. Why don't you radio Moscow, let them know we'll be in El Salvador on the expected date. Yes, Comrade. Excuse me. Ciao. Try it. IVAN: Enough! Comrade, meet your new pupil. Andrei Zimmerman. But then, I can see you've already met. Come on. Move it, move it. Come on, move, move. Move your ass, soldier. Move! Move, move, move, move. You can do better than that. Come on! That was close, lady. Hey, you're lucky I didn't blow your ass off. You're one second late. Do it again. Move! Sir! Good morning, Sergeant. How's our man doing? Doing just fine, sir. Coming right along. Well, I'm afraid we'll have to cut his training short. We need him. Think he's ready? I think he can handle it, I really do. You've done a terrific job, I appreciate it. Thank you, sir. Carry on. Rick! We're going to have to cut your training short, old buddy. Spotted our friends Ivan and Cotter in a training camp in Kampuchea. Gonna have to get rolling right away. Let's do it. Let's go. So who are you really? I'm American. That's why I'm here. I don't follow you. You need all the help you can get. It's America that's responsible for most of the economic and civil strife in a lot of Third World countries. America reaps off the wealth and leaves the people with nothing. So how can you help? By setting an example. How do you mean, example? I stand up against the American money machine. Hopefully, others will have enough sense to follow soon and help wipe out this useless American imperialism. Don't ask questions. Your job is to train. Fine. See you at training 0600 and don't be late. Sir, we are outnumbered. No. We've got surprise on our side. Ten minutes, blow it up. Everyone knows their assignments. Our lives depend on each other. No dead heroes. All right, that's everything. Let's go. IVAN: You should consider yourselves very fortunate for you are among the chosen few, entrusted to obtain our ultimate goal. You will spread terrorism around the world and lay the blame on the United States of America for they are the root of poverty and hunger everywhere. In our society, there must be one religion, one government, one organization and that is Communism. You will not fail. The only failure you will accept is death. Stop, open it up. Right now. Don't move or I'll blow you away. Take him. Come on. Where did they go? I don't know. Where'd they go? I don't know. Hey. Where did they go? No. Where did they go? They went to El Salvador. [SCREAMING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Sanders, come out or I'll blow your ass off. Why don't you kill him? You take care of him. [SCOFFING] It will be my pleasure. Have I got something for you, baby. Don't just stand there. Get in. Before I blow the boat up. Why did you blow it up? So, it won't end up in the wrong hands. So, who the hell are you? I'm your contact. I work for Baylor just like you. Baylor? That son of a bitch. If you have nothing nice to say, shut your fucking mouth. Hurry up. We've got to be in the camp tomorrow before noon. Oh, shit! [ENGINE STARTING] SANDERS: So, how did you get involved with CIA? BARBARA: Three years ago, I was studying at UCLA, political science. UCLA? Yes, my father sent me there. He had big ambitions for me. But then, one day, a group of Communist pigs, they came and they killed him. They also raped my mother and my sister. And still, as if that was not enough, they burned our house. They took everything away from me. My home and my family and even my dreams. Sorry to hear that. You still haven't answered my question. I love freedom and that's the last thing anybody's gonna take away from me. My God, help me. I'll do anything in all my power to protect that right. And America means freedom to me. I used to think America should mind its own business. I was wrong. We are a watchdog. If we go to sleep, the Communists will steal this world, surely as thieves in the night. You have your family? No, no, not anymore. What happened? Cotter killed them. Cotter? He's the reason I took this assignment. I can't believe that. Well, believe it. I saw him. He tried to kill me. He was my best friend in Vietnam. He saved my life. God, forgive me, I'm gonna kill him. What the hell are you doing out here? You're young, beautiful, and your whole life is ahead of you. Get out of here while you got the time. Don't you think it's already too late? It's too late only if you think it is. ♪ The night is cold ♪ There's no one to keep me warm ♪ But then you came along ♪ In the midst of my loneliness ♪ You gave me hope ♪ You changed my life and made me feel ♪ That my world is not so bad after all ♪ When you take me to your world ♪ My love, with you I feel so good ♪ You take me to your world ♪ There's no more emptiness in me ♪ When you take me to your world ♪ It's only you who means everything to me ♪ When you take me to your world ♪ Let us build our dreams together ♪ You and me ♪ Have just found each other ♪ There's a place in my heart ♪ Where you belong ♪ The two of us ♪ Have shared a precious moment together ♪ When you make love to me ♪ When you take me to your world ♪ My love with you I feel so good ♪ You take me to your world ♪ There's no more emptiness in me ♪ When you take me to your world ♪ It's you who mean everything to me ♪ When you take me to your world ♪ Let's build our dreams together ♪ [SPEAKING SPANISH] There's a traitor in this camp.

Callate,you're still too young to know everything. But not too young to die for you. [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] MAN: The buyer comes tonight. What do I do? You tell me. What do I do? [ORGAN MUSIC PLAYING] [CONGREGATION CLAMORING] I must admit, Enrique, I wasn't expecting all of this. Senor,for you, I'll do everything. And with your help, I'll free El Salvador from the imperialist Americanos and then you gonna make me presidente,no? IVAN: I suggest you finish your revolution? No competencia, Senor. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Look at her, brains and beauty. Beauty is also deceiving. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Good evening. Gentlemen, good evening. For you. I would like to propose a toast for my beautiful senorita. I would also like to propose a toast to Andrei, the former Harold Cotter, U.S. Army, and to the success of his next mission. Mr. Lim is here. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Buenas noches, Mr. Lim. I want you to meet my friends, SenoritaBarbara, SenorIvan, and SenorAndrei. You have our merchandise? Unfortunately, Mr. Lim, my men were ambushed by the government troops. They took the guns and the cocaine. Mr. Bautista will not like that. You have our cocaine. You give us our guns or else... What do you want me to do? I told you we lost everything. I lost my men, the guns, the cocaine, and now, you tell me this. I think you better leave before I kill you. This is unfortunate. Nobody crosses Mr. Bautista. Ah, Bautista. I'm not afraid of Bautista. You're talking to the future presidente of El Salvador. I think you better leave before I change my mind. [SPITS] Bautista! Sanders. Sanders, where are you? [GASPS] What the hell is going on? Two hours late. I'm sorry, I couldn't get away from Enrique. Cotter and the Russians are here. I heard this morning that they're getting ready for a major offensive tomorrow to serve as diversion for the big plan in three days. Plan? What plan? I don't know what the plans are. We've got to get hold of Baylor. Okay, I'll take you to the radio room. Come on. Let's go! Charlie One. Charlie One, this is Charlie Two, do you read? Over. Charlie One, this is Charlie Two. Do you read? Over. Charlie Two, this is Charlie One. Go ahead. Subject is confirmed. I repeat. Subject is confirmed. So, what's gonna happen in three days? Three days. Three days. Hurry up! Come on. Haven't got lots of time here. Three days. What's gonna happen in three days? The Pope! The Pope! They're going to El Salvador. Charlie Two, you must neutralize the subject at any cost. I repeat, at any cost. Roger. Soldados,get their guns! I told you before, Comrade, beauty can be deceiving. Cabrona! And you, I'm going to blow your head off. IVAN: Wait, I have better plans for him. You and me, Cotter. You and me. Take them to the torture chamber. Soldados! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GROANING] I'll remember you. I can assure you, Mr. Sanders, my student here is much better at this than Lopez. In fact, maybe a little demonstration is in order. Andrei, why don't you show Mr. Sanders some of your skills? Harry. Harry. It's me, Rick. Rick Sanders. What... IVAN: Hold it. You're a sick man. Not sick, Mr. Sanders, perceptive. In three days, he's going to kill the Pope. After we finish with you, we'll have to kill the president of the United States? Imagine, all the blame falls on the CIA. If you want to kill somebody, why not kill her? She deserves it the most. SenorComrade. Why don't you give me the honor of killing her? You want her? Si. Take her. She's yours. Muchas gracias,Comrade. Come along, Andrei. We've got other matters to attend to. Cabrona! [SPEAKING SPANISH] [GASPS] He's gonna rape me. [SPEAKING SPANISH] I'll kill you. Do you understand me? I'll kill you. You bastard, I'll kill you!
