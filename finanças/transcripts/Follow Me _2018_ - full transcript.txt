Sorry, do you have Instagram? -Instagram? -Yeah. -[both] No. -You don't have Snapchat? -No. -Why? Who are you? No, I just need followers, so, like, I was asking. -Huh? -I just need followers. -Wow, really? -Yeah. [woman] Are you serious? Are you serious? -Yeah. -You won't take the time to talk to us? Seriously, mate. How many real friends do you have? No, I have friends. But followers-- Like real friends, who will sit down with you-- -Fuck Snapchat. Fuck Instagram. -Sit down with you, maybe, uh... -Delete that. -Put your phone away. Put your phone away. Put your phone away. Come have a drink with us. [up-tempo music] [man] Hi. My name is Asri Bendacha. I'm 32 years old. I'm living in Dubai, and I need a job, 'cause I'm broke. -Are we good? -Yeah, it's done. [Asri] Everything started when I read an article in The National newspaper about some people getting paid $5,000 to post a picture on Instagram. Apparently, those people are called "social media influencers". If you've never heard of them, that means that you're not on social media, and if you're not on social media, that means that you are like me. How is this possible? How can you get paid to post a picture on your social media? So I had to attend fashion shows, make-up workshops and conferences. I had to meet with professional photographers, PR and marketing agencies, and, of course, I interviewed the top influencer from the region to answer this one simple question: How do you become a social media influencer? 3.8 million, almost 3.9. 200,00. 277. 1.4 million. 220,000. 140K. Now I have 1.5. 1.6. Almost a million. Almost. 160,000. 107,000. 240,000. I'm approaching 400,000. 81,000. 109,000. 105,000. When you publish this, it's gonna be two million. -526,000. -Two million. 76,786 followers. Personally, I don't like to call myself an influencer. Like, I don't mind hearing it from other people, because they are the ones who decide if I influence or no. I consider myself a blogger, yeah. [Asri] Okay, not influencer. Well, I'm a blogger who influences, hopefully. I feel like "influencer" is a really strong word to use. So that's why I like to use "content creator". I, personally, would never put myself... I wouldn't meet somebody, like, "Hi, guys, I'm an influencer." I mean, sorry for my language, but what the fuck? Did you go to school for that? Are you doing something else with your life? Influencers used to be bloggers. Just bloggers. And then, with the rise of social media, they were bloggers that had a presence on social media. What we've found now is what we call "blaggers." So you have your bloggers, which are your traditional influencers, and then you have your blaggers. And these are just normal people, who want things for free, or want to be paid for posting about stuff, and they think they are, you know, videographers and photographers because they have a smart phone, and it empowers them to be creative. About three, four years back, brands didn't really know about influencers, but today it's very different. Today, influencers are on the front row at fashion shows, they're a part of every marketing campaign. Today, brands know the value of influencers. Almost every brand that we work with uses influencers in some form or another as part of their campaign. A lot of the work we do is actually with agencies, so kind of media agencies, PR agencies, um, we basically help them get an understanding of the market, the buzz out there, like, what the consumer opinion is. In terms of influence to purchase, it was like 71%. -[Asri] 71 percent? -Yeah. -Which is a lot? -Which is a lot, yeah. These days, when we don't see TV, and we don't read the newspaper, or look at magazines, where else do we find our inspiration? It's on, you know, Instagram, while doing this. [Asri] This guy and this guy created this in 2010. In only two years, 100 million people downloaded this. So this guy gave to those guys one million of these in exchange for this. Now, this guy and this guy are really good friends. Four years later, 500 million people downloaded this... for free. And now, this is worth 50 billion of these. You are probably thinking that this guy is smart. I am too, because this guy created this and owns this. But how come this is worth 50 billion of these, even if this is free? Well, to get the answer, and gain followers, I went to Gitex, one of the world's biggest annual new technology exhibitions to attend an Instagram conference. [static zapping] Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't want you to see this conference for some reason. But they are also not very happy about this film. So their lawyer sent me a letter threatening me with the subject line: "Demand to remove unlawful footage from your film Follow Me. We demand that you not distribute or show the film until such footage is removed from all copies. If you do not comply with this demand, our client will be forced to pursue any and all legal or equitable remedies our client may have against you. All rights are expressly reserved." But anyway, during this conference, I learned that Selena Gomez has the number one Instagram account with over 120 million followers. Maybe this will be useful later. But if I want to get followers, I will have to do it my way. ♪ This is the rhythm of my life ♪ ♪ O-way-o-way-o ♪ ♪ This is the rhythm of my life ♪ ♪ This is the rhythm of my life ♪ ♪ O-way-o-way-o ♪ ♪ Music keeps me alive ♪ ♪ O-way-o-way-o ♪ ♪ Take me from the dark into the light ♪ -♪ To the light ♪ -♪ O-way-o-way-o ♪ ♪ Music in my life day and night ♪ -♪ Day and night ♪ -♪ O-way-o-way-o ♪ ♪ You gotta believe me You gotta believe me ♪ ♪ Let me show you how to fly ♪ ♪ Gotta believe me We go so high ♪ ♪ Impossible to come back down ♪ ♪ No need to wonder You don't need to sweat ♪ ♪ See me rising off the ground ♪ ♪ Just seconds away from losing it ♪ ♪ When I hear it coming down ♪ ♪ And if I don't go up high enough ♪ ♪ And if I don' t go up high enough ♪ ♪ Turn the music up now ♪ Excuse me, can you follow me on Instagram? ♪ This is the rhythm of my life ♪ ♪ O-way-o-way-o ♪ What happened?

I need followers. [Asri] But actually, I should have kept it, so I could buy some followers. Because in this world, everything is for sale, including us. [woman] No more fake followers. No more spending hours following, unfollowing, liking and commenting. Let us grow your Instagram engagement while you get on with whatever you'd rather be doing. [recording] We are still assisting other customers. Please stay on the line and we will be with you soon. [muzak plays] [phone ringing] Hello, this is Chloe from Social Envy, how can we help you today? Hi, uh, my name is Mr. Bendacha, Asri, and I need followers for my Instagram account. Mm-hmm, yep, we can do that for you. Are you interested in buying real followers or fake followers Um, I don't know, what's the difference between real and fake? So, real followers will engage with your page and they are real people who have real accounts. Fake followers just get your numbers up but they probably do not engage with your page. Okay, so I'll go for some real followers. Are they gonna like my pictures? Absolutely. Because they are real followers, they will interact and engage with your page. How can I have 10,000 followers from now? 10,000 followers, okay. So you'll probably be signing up for one of the longer term plans. All the plans work exactly the same caliber. The longer you sign up for, the cheaper the plans become. Do my followers that I'm gonna buy now, the real ones, can they be from the Middle East, or can they be somewhere specific, or no? Absolutely, so we can age, gender and location target your followers for you. That's perfect, thank you so much. -What's your name? -Chloe. Chloe, can you follow me also on Instagram? Yeah, what was your username? It's follow... A-S-R-I. Okay, following you... now. Thank you very much! Have a good day. -You too, bye. -Bye. -Bye. -[line disconnects] [Asri] So how does it work? It costs $33 per week to gain some followers. So, I'm gonna try their services for a week, and see how it goes. I'm very curious about these real people who don't know me, and will supposedly follow me, like my pictures, and comment on my posts without knowing that I paid a company to get them to follow me in the first place. In one week, I gained 48 new followers, which is almost a dollar per follower. That's way too much for me. But there might be a cheaper way to get some followers. And the beauty of the Internet is that you can find tutorials on absolutely everything, including how to get followers. So, you want some Instagram followers, huh? Well, you came to the right spot my friend. You need to give to receive. Now open the Instagram app, and set up the search option from the bottom. Now, every day I wake up to hundreds of new followers. And it's really amazing. Do you have less than 500 followers on Instagram? I'm Sue B. Zimmeran, and today I'm gonna tell you how you can get those initial 500 followers. [up-tempo jazzy music] I don't like to say "online expert", I like other people to call me an expert, I don't like to call myself an expert. But I like the word "educator". It simply starts by growing an Instagram account in the space, in the niche, in the market, that you want to be, um, teaching, or serving or helping. And that's where it really starts. Getting followers doesn't happen by doing "X". Getting followers happens by consistently showing up every day, and thinking about "How can I give value to the people I'm meant to be serving?" Not "How can I get followers?" That should not be the first thing you're thinking about. What we are more proud of is our free Instagram strategy guide, which anyone listening to this can grab on my website: It's 17 pages of free content that people read and say, "Oh, my God, if this was free, I can't imagine what I would get if I actually bought something. " So, by doing stories regularly you can get more followers. By having a strong hashtag strategy, by using a geotag, and by presenting really great, visual, high quality photos and videos. [Asri] Photos, videos, live streaming. All this content makes us spend hours per day on social media. But what is a good content anyway? How do you create good content? And more importantly, what makes us comment on and share content? The trick is how do you create highly engaging, entertaining content. Stuff that people actually wanna watch. And that is something that you should think about when you make content. You're making a documentary. Why do I care about your... Why would I want to watch your documentary? You have to think about, you know, what's gonna... Is it gonna move me, is it gonna make me talk about it, is it gonna make me engaged? Also, what's interesting is the barriers to entry for people, it's-- Technology has created no barriers to entry at all. It's very easy, you have a camera, you're a filmmaker, you don't have to get a studio, you just go out to the Canon store and you buy a camera, and you're a filmmaker. You're a content creator. We're all content creators now. We live in a world of content creators. Hello! [in Arabic] Welcome! How are you all? It's very important for Dubai. As you know, Dubai has become an iconic destination in the world, and UAE in general. It's important for us, as the Dubai government, to focus on this sector, as we believe its growing very fast, and we need to give chance, uh, chances to young, talented entrepreneurs, to position themselves in the right place, and find themselves a home. Today we saw a lot of talents here, and in the market or in the sports fields or in the fashion fields. They want to come to Dubai to promote themselves and to promote their brands. And it's important for Dubai to give them that chance, and, you know, it's the land of opportunity. [Asri] Dubai is unique. And that's why it will become the number one tourist destination in the world by 2020. Early on, the Dubai government recognized the power of social media, and how they could use it to promote the city around the world. The hashtag #mydubai was created in 2014 by the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed Al Maktoum, and has been used more than 20 million times on Instagram alone. Every time we film, or take pictures and post on social media, we are creating content, and all of this is because of the introduction of the smartphone. We are not buying phones anymore. We are buying cameras that we sometimes use as phones. [man] Capture your world, with our second generation Leica dual camera and optical image stabilization. [man 2] A new camera captures shots you never could before. [up-tempo music] That's because its larger F-1.8 aperture, new sensor, and six element lens enable brighter, more detailed photos and videos. [Asri] And here comes the selfie. A recent survey showed that millennials will take up to 25,000 selfies during their lifetime. I'm not a selfie freak, so I better learn how to take a good selfie that my followers will like. Gentlemen, today, I'm going over 10 selfie tips to help you improve your selfie satisfaction. [woman] Hold your camera and extend your arm out. The further the camera is away, the more it will reduce that fishbowl effect. It literally doubles the size of your ass instantly, and if you kind of just tilt the camera down a little, boom, you got an Instagram booty for days. Ooh-ooh! [Asri] As a photographer, do you take selfies? No. It's self-gratification, on the lowest level, I think. If I'm somewhere and I have beautiful scenery behind me, and there is no one else, and I want to take memory of that, okay, I take a selfie, but only if you can see something interesting in the background. I never take a full, you know, selfie, like-- -[Asri] Why not? -It's, uh, egotistical. [Asri] Do you take selfie? -No. -[Asri] Why not? [Asri] Do you take selfies? Are you asking me a question? Yes, of course! -Why do you take selfies? -I love selfies. Why? 'Cause it's a picture of me, that I'll remember. -You like yourself? -Yeah, of course! You don't love yourself? Sometimes yes, sometime no. That means you have a problem. -I don't really take selfies. -[Asri] No? No. If you look at my page, you won't see a selfie. If you're good looking, or you're stylish, you should be thankful to God, and you post it, and even if you're not -- -[Asri] Why do you take selfies? -Why? -Yeah. -If I'm somewhere exciting. -[Asri] Do you take selfies? -Yeah, of course. -Why? -'Cause I love myself. -You love yourself? -No, I also wanna see how I look like. -I like myself so much. -[Asri] Yeah? Life is all about ourselves. And selfies fits into that. No, not like that. Do it like this. If you want we can do it like that. But it's sexier to do it with your mouth like this. Okay, let's do it. Wow! Let's look. [up-tempo pop song] [man sings in foreign language] [Asri] Our obsession with photos makes us take pictures of absolutely everything. And brands understand how to capitalize on our behavior. At every single event I've been to, brands are offering us the chance to take pictures of ourselves, knowing that we will probably post it on our social media, and, therefore, promote them for free. But what if I tell you that it's not always free. Sometime you are actually paying brands to promote themselves. Do you need my email? Do you need my phone number? I don't need anything from your side. If you choose one of the pictures, you send it to yourself by email, or you post it in your personal Facebook. -That's it. -So I have to give you my email? Yeah, but after that. First, I have to take the picture. Yeah, but then I give you my email. [Asri] Your email address, or your Facebook information, have value. And once you share this information, they can sell it to a third party. And that's how you pay the brand to promote them in exchange of a picture. What about videos? The first movie ever created is called The Sprinkle Sprinkled by the Lumiere brothers. It was released in 1895, but today, things have changed a little bit. Ever since Chad Hurley, Steve Chen and Jawed Karim created something called YouTube. GCC has one of the most engaged social media population in the world. Kuwait has the number one Instagram user per capita, and Saudi Arabia has the number one Snapchat user per capita. What about YouTube? Well, 300 million videos are viewed every day in the Arab region, making it the world's second largest viewership after the US. This is probably because 60 percent of the population is under 25 years old. Especially in the Middle East, where some North American or Western television shows might not be seen here or that people are limited in the type of content that they can view, so they're looking to other channels to get that content. So they're looking to YouTube, they're looking to social media, Instagram, to see where can I watch programs that speak to me. And that's where these influencers are becoming the new face of celebrity today. [Asri] Ethan. When I went to visit my sister, she told me what Ethan wanted to be when he grows up. And I thought his answer was very interesting. So I took my camera, and asked him. -Who am I? -Um, Uncle Asri. I'm Uncle Asri? -Give me a kiss? -Yeah. -Ethan? -Yeah? What do you wanna do when you grow up? A YouTuber and a coach. -What? -A YouTuber and a coach. A coach for what? Of gymnastics. Gymnastics and a YouTuber? -Yeah. -And why you wanna be a YouTuber? Because it's fun. [Asri] When a six-year-old kid is telling you he wants to become a YouTuber, you realize the influence of social media on the new generation. Kids are no longer watching TV. Instead, they watch their programs on the iPad or smartphone of their parents, so their role models are no longer TV or movie stars, but social media celebrities. [up-tempo music] [Asri] Why did you start posting videos of yourself online? Well actually, I've always been so passionate about media in general, and presenting, and it's been my dream ever since I was a kid just to be a TV presenter, so I started my channel when I was 18. Just for fun, I did it as a hobby. I started just making videos. I used to make videos when I was around, maybe 12 years old. We always loved YouTube, and he told me, "Why don't we open a YouTube show in Arabic?" And I said, "Are you crazy? No one is gonna watch us!" And look at us now, Abdulaziz. So, expressing through media is really big. And when I didn't get the chance to do this on TV and other platforms, I went to YouTube. 'Cause YouTube accepts you as how you are. For me, YouTube is my middle name. I can't, like, it's my identity. [Asri] What's your relationship with YouTube? Are you in contact with them? Yeah, I'm in contact with them. Yeah, YouTube is my number one key. If YouTube was a man, I would marry him Because I love YouTube so much. [Asri] This is a full-time job now? -[both] Um... -[Asri] Are you still studying? No. You can say we are full-time YouTubers and half-time students. I do YouTube as a living. I do, uh, my shows, I do everything. I do, I work hard, I grind. It's not easy. People think it's easy, but I work hard for what I do to support my family. You get money out of it. When you first, first start, it takes some time to pick up, 'cause you're building a channel from zero. But then when you get there, what's nice about it is you really work on yourself. You become a personality. I got to do different stuff, like MCing, voiceover, attending events, collaborations with companies. [Asri] Now, are you collaborating with brands? Yes, you can say that, yeah. So what are you doing with brands, how does it work? We don't like to advertise, like, direct. We like to put it indirectly. We see a shift today. Brands are paying more attention, or really shifting, to personalities online, rather than going to the traditional media as they used to in the past. And that's because they realize the importance of having a trust relationship with the viewers. That makes any sort of advertising much more effective, and it creates much more hype, because basically the relationship we have online is based on trust. Hello! How are you? I'm great, how are you? Great, thank you. Thank you so much for coming. Business-wise, brands look for influencers. They want people that have an impact, that can sell. [Asri] How many brands are approaching you? Oh, it happens on a daily basis. You get constant, constant emails from brands, because you're online, you're easily accessed. People can contact you easily. But, it's really just about selecting the right brand for my brand. Because I also represent something online. So this is what it is, taking a brand that's in line with what I also stand for, and also to communicate their message in my way. So that's where you have successful collaboration with a brand. [Asri] Are you coming up with the scenarios and everything? Yeah, we do all the dialogue. They ask us, Saudi Reporters, we love you, we want to collaborate. And you do all the work. Some companies, they love your work, but they have certain guidelines, and certain viewership that they want to see. For example, when we talk about a campaign that I'm still doing with Ferrero Rocher. [speaks in foreign language] Ferrero's brand is very luxurious, very sophisticated. Still it's something that I like to show. I like to show different styles of cooking, different things you can do with food. So it depends on the brand and what they like. [Asri] A secret informer gave me a social media influencer contract signed between a famous sports brand and an influencer who has 40,000 followers. For one year, the influencer has to post three pictures per month wearing the brand without mentioning that he is getting paid to advertise it. The terms of the agreement also mention that he can't post any picture wearing a competitor's brand for the next 15 months. So, basically, he has to post three pictures per month for one year, in exchange of $7,200. That means the influencer is getting paid $250 per post, which is not bad. Free clothes and getting paid to post. I would do it. There is financial compensation for all agreements with influencers. And it's usually done through the agency or the communication experts. Most of the influencers now have their rate cards, so it's very straightforward, an Instagram post is gonna cost between $1,000 to $5,000. So there is a price, for, like, a post on Instagram. There is a price for a post on Snapchat. There is a price for both of them. If it was a campaign I usually have to do a package, you know, if it was more than one post. So it depends. The transition has been so much that we had the bloggers, then we had a few social media influencers, then the blaggers came, and now you've got some of the social media influencers almost becoming human billboards. These influencers have agents and managers, just like television and film stars have agents and managers. It's part of the entertainment business now. They are part of entertainment. It's not just: they're just part of YouTube, or they're just part of Instagram. This is entertainment. This is a business. I read in the newspaper, you know, there is this article in The National, have you read it? Yeah. They talk about you and they said you get, like, $5,000 per post. -Is it true or not? -No. -It's more? -No. If you're a big brand, I take, uh-- No. Why should I have to say to you? -Oh, I will not tell you. -[Asri] No? Never? No, this is... No, this is confidential. -This is confidential? -Yeah. To this day, I don't get paid for any of my posts. They give me things in return, which, for me, are super valuable. Whatever they are saving me on the other end, which is mainly a lot of time, I can monetize that in my own business. So, it's much better that way. Well, with a startup, we'd start off with $3,000. -Yeah. -[Asri] For one post? For one post, yeah. I know a lot of people have a lot of sensitivity to this. But it is where the world is today. Clients and brands are so used to doing the typical thing, 80,000 dirhams for a magazine, one page. Or paying for a newspaper, or paying for old traditional. It is important, but not as important as before. Before, that was the only thing. Today, you use half of that money online, you get 10 times more results. I think that true influencer relationship marketing should be a real value exchange between the brand and the person or individual that you are having this relationship with. It is not a cynical, transactional relationship that only happens for two tweets, or one post, or one event. It's not meaningful. Do I believe somebody is worth $30,000 for one picture? If he's effective, yes. Because he will get them ten times more results than a magazine cover, or a billboard on the road. So if you look at it in that way, it makes business sense. Correct, but you know, it's just followers are one of the numbers. So, when we do advertising, for example, when a brand pays money for advertising, they will pay money so that that piece of content can be seen by, say for example, 10,000 people. That's how a brand decides to advertise. With influencers it's the same thing. You can call it viewership. So viewership, TV viewership, billboard viewership. How many people can you reach? Whether you're an influencer, whether you're a billboard, whether you're a TV ad, whatever it is, as an advertising tool, it's about the reach. Is influencer marketing a trend? And we ask that about a lot of things. But do you know what is the one thing that hasn't changed in hundreds of year? The one thing that hasn't changed in hundreds of years, and it will never change, is that brands will always put money wherever the audience is. [Asri] And the audience is online, spending nearly two hours per day on social media, which represent five years and four months in a lifetime. And that is just the beginning. If time is money, that explains why Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook or YouTube are making so much cash. But it can't be the only reason. Look around you, Mitchell. This is the free Internet. We do everything here. We connect with friends on Facebook, search for information on Google, and all of it's free. Yeah, free. Wait, actually how do these sites make money? I'll tell you. But you may not like where the rabbit hole goes. Where are we? What is this place? This is the Internet of the real. The truth is, these services aren't free at all. You pay for them with your very identity. When you use Facebook, they log everything you do. The pages you like, the people you interact with, even the words in your status updates. They take that information, analyze it, and assemble a detailed profile of who you are. And then they sell that information to advertisers. Hello, Mitchell, I've been waiting for you. This is Ethan Zuckerman, he's the director of the MIT Center for Civic Media. Once you understand that everything on the internet is "free", what it really means is that we are paying for it with our attention, and that anyone who figures out how to channel our attention, how to package it, and how to resell it, they're the people who are really making the most money in this new economy. With something like Snapchat and Instagram, it's a little bit more subtle. It's within the thing that you're already paying attention to. You're following me on Snapchat because I'm such an exciting guy and I live such an exciting life, and at some point I tell you that one of the things I'm really happy about is this power adaptor. I love this power adaptor. I take it all over the world with me, because it lets me plug in my electronics all the time. And suddenly, the attention that you're already paying to me, now you're paying attention to the product. So, within all of this, think of it as a giant sea of attention. All of the time that we are spending on screens, brands are interested, can take a little trickle of that giant ocean, and bring it over to the product that they care about. That's what makes this whole industry go. That's what makes it tick. Facebook finds that you're much more valuable, the more information that they can figure out about you. Facebook tells you that they want to know you better so they do a better job of providing information to you. But really what it is is Facebook wants as much information about you as possible, because then they can sell you to a brand more efficiently and for more money. [Asri] I needed to get in touch with Facebook and Instagram. But when you are on a budget, there is only one way to get around. So I borrowed my sister's bike... [man sings in foreign language] ...and set off to California. ♪ God bless, bless America ♪ [sings in foreign language] ♪ God bless, bless America ♪ [sings in foreign language] ♪ God bless, bless America ♪ [sings in foreign language] ♪ God bless, bless America ♪ [sings in foreign language] ♪ God bless, bless America ♪ [sings in foreign language] ♪ God bless... ♪ [snoring] [Asri] The Facebook headquarters is located in Silicon Valley, where all the new technology and startup companies are established. The Facebook campus is huge and very secure. There are security guards and cameras absolutely everywhere. [Asri] I can't have one? -Are you...what's that? -Can I have one? Are you here to visit an employee? -Uh, no. -So do you have an appointment? Uh, I'm here for the appointment. -To get an appointment. -Okay. So, the only thing that I would be able to have you do is fill out a form today. Anything with your picture, your name. -[woman] Can I give my Facebook profile? -Yeah, that's fine. I have a Facebook profile too. -But they're here to meet with an employee. -Ah, okay, okay. So I filled out the form, knowing that no one will reply. But, if you have a friend who works at the company, you can access the building. All right. -[Asri] Do you guys work here? -He does. Oh, him? Can we be friends? Excuse me. Sorry, go ahead. Can we be friends so we can visit the office? Oh, I'm actually taking these guys on a tour right now, so... I can't. -[Asri] I'm part of it. -I'm sorry man. -I won't talk, watch -I know, I know, I know. -I'm not talking at all. -I don't know you. I'm on a schedule, and I want to give my friends a tour right now. It's your friends. Ah, okay. So there's no way we can be friends in the near future? [laughs] It's possible. -It's possible! -Now's not the right time. [Asri] Apparently, you can visit the office if you know an employee. Yeah, social visits are allowed. -Can I be your friends? -No, there's no chance. -Do you have Instagram? -Uh, yeah. -Can you follow me at least? -No, that's alright. -Okay. So there's no way we can-- -No, visitors aren't allowed. You can take a picture out there by the sign. Yeah, but I want Instagram, I don't care about Facebook. -Okay. No, can't help you. -I wanted to check. -No one will let you in. -I'll try. -[Asri] Hi, you good? -Let me escort you out. [Asri] Okay. That's it. Have a good day. -Where are you from? -[Asri] Dubai. -Where are you coming from? -Dubai. Dubai! Oh! Pleasure to meet you. -Nice to meet you. -What's your name? -Asri. -Asley? -Yeah. -Asley you take care, huh? Be safe. So I went to the Instagram office, and it's impossible to go in. It's impossible to talk to someone. They checked my ID, they screenshot my Instagram account, and they asked me to leave. So, I left. Anyway, I still know someone with hundreds of millions of followers. Selena Gomez has the number one Instagram account, and if I want to find her, I have to go where all the celebrities live, in Hollywood. [Argentinian hip hop music] [man raps in Spanish] [Asri] Gracias. [Asri speaks Spanish] [woman] Do you have Instagram? [Asri speaks Spanish] -You talk Spanish? -Si. Ooh! Okay, what's your Instagram? [Asri speaks Spanish] -Huh? -You'll follow me? -Yeah, I'll follow you. -I'll follow you too. You'll follow me too? Okay. -Oh, so all that. -Yeah: FollowAsri. -You'll follow me? -We will. -Sure? Alright, thank you. -Yeah. [laughs] [woman sings pop song in foreign language] [knocking] [Asri] Hi, sir, do you know where Selena Gomez lives? No, I don't. We don't visit the, uh... the celebrity homes. I don't know. Zorro, do you know where Selena Gomez lives? -Who? -Selena Gomez. -Selena? Selena. -Yeah. Selena Gomez? I'm not sure she got a star yet. I don't think so. Not yet. -[Asri] Okay. -I don't think so. Not the star, but where she lives. I don't know where she lives. Where she lives? Oh, where her star is? -[Asri] No, where she lives. -Where she lives. I don't know the answer to that. -Thank you. -Good luck. -If you give me $1,000 I'll find out. -[Asri] I don't have $1,000. Chewbacca! Do you know where Selena Gomez lives? How would I know? Go away. -What? You don't know? -I don't know. You know what? Go to a store's map. -Hi, do you guys work here? -Yes. Yeah, I need a map of celebrities, of where they live. Do you think Selena Gomez is inside? -Who? -Selena Gomez. Selena Gomez... No, I don't know. Can you check Selena Gomez? -You have to look for "G". -Ah, wait, "G". -No, it's not on here. -It's not on here? Oh, no, she's not on here. -Not on here. -No. Hi, do you know where Selena Gomez lives? -Who? -Selena Gomez? You don't do a tour to her house? I mean, we do the tour, but I don't know where she lives. I don't know her address. -That would be creepy, you know? -What? -That would be creepy if I knew her address. -Why? Because then I would know her address. Where can I meet celebrities? It's really just the luck of the draw. You can go to Beverly Hills. -None of them are gonna come here. -No? No, no one's gonna come on the boulevard. They don't come in Hollywood? They don't live in Hollywood? I mean, they live in Hollywood, but none of them-- they're not gonna step foot on here. Know what'll happen? They're gonna get mugged. Ah, okay. [whistling] Just curious, my friend, what are you shooting for? My name is Asri, I come from Dubai. And I just-- What's happening? No, no, no. This is our place. -This is what? -This is Danny's... -Place? -Yeah, coffee. -It's opening? It's opening? -What? -We're already open. We're open. -Oh, okay. Do you think I can ask him a question? Not right now. -You can take some photos. -Oh, I can take a picture? You can take a picture. -[camera shutter] -Who you with? -I'm with myself. -Okay. Do you know where Selena Gomez lives? No, go to the left. No, the camera, there! Okay, got it? Okay. That's it? You don't know where Selena Gomez lives? -I can't hear you, what? -Selena Gomez, do you know where she lives? -Who? -Selena Gomez. Yeah, I know her. Why, so what? I wanna go to see her. I need followers. No. [low-tempo music] I couldn't find her. No one knows where she lives. Now I'm in Los Angeles, out of ideas, and the only person I know who lives here is Philip Alberstat, the CEO of Contend that I met in Dubai. So let's see if he can help me. -And, action! -Asri... you gotta go to VidCon. [rap song in foreign language] Do you guys wanna be on my Snapchat? [all shouting] [trilling] Yeah! Whoo! [crowd screaming] [Asri] VidCon is an annual conference where millennials celebrate their favorite influencers. As a 32-year-old newbie, entering in this online world is like being an Eskimo in Dubai during the summer. Everything makes me feel like an outsider of this community. They even have their own kind of music, which appears to be a derivative of hip hop. It's every day bro, hey. It's every day, bro It's every day, bro. [girl] Oh, my God. -Do you know who, uh, who Jake Paul is? -[Asri] No. ♪ It's every day bro with a Disney Channel flow ♪ ♪ Five mil on YouTube Been six months Never done before ♪ ♪ Passed all the competition, man ♪ ♪ PewDiePie is next Man I'm popping all these checks ♪ ♪ Got the brand new Rolex and then-- ♪ [sighs] [Asri] I went to VidCon to get followers, but so far, all I got was this guy following me around the conference. If you had a channel, or if you're recording this, where are they appearing? [Asri] But I realized, I don't even understand why people follow anyone on social media. How many subscribers do you have? -I have 300K. -300K? And on Instagram? -He's kinda relevant. -I have a million on Instagram. And why do you like him? Seriously, what makes him so special? -That's why. -[girl screams] -[girl 1] Love you, daddy. -[girl 2] Love you, daddy. [Asri] What do you mean by "daddy"? What is "daddy"? -You don't know what "daddy" means? -[Asri] No. [laughs] -It's so hard to explain to people. -Oh, my God! I love him so much! and I wanna marry him, and... yeah. -[screaming] Daddy! Daddy! -[Asri] What does it mean, "daddy"? [all laughing] Daddy is like, when they want, him to have their kids. -Like he's really attractive. -And you want to have babies with him. -Ah, he's the daddy of your baby. -Yes. He's daddy as hell. I want him to make me have quadruplets. -[Asri] Okay. -Yes. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. [Asri] What makes him so interesting for them? -He's a big YouTuber. -Yeah, but of what? -He vlogs, so-- -He's a daily vlogger. -He's a daily vlogger, and -- -And it's more of his kids. Yeah, 'cause his kids are, like, the more inspirational ones. They do different things, they go out on tours, it's really cool, because it's just like, you get to see their daily lives, and you see, like, just their story and it's really interesting. [Asri] What is interesting into their stories? -About their story? -Yeah, what? What is interesting? Like... do you wanna ? Well, they have a family, they have kids too, so watching their life, it's relatable. You feel like you start to become friends with their own children. Yeah, but you have a family too, right? Yeah. So, their life is different from your family? Yeah, everyone's different. So what makes them more interesting than your own family? No, they're no-- Is your family not interesting? No, my family is inter-- I'm not saying that my family isn't interesting. I'm saying, like, you know, just their story is really cool. -And they have a cool story? -Yeah. basically a lip-syncing app, but it's more than that now. Like, people put their talent on there. People can sing, they can dance, make their own comedies... It's a way to put out your talent. So what's your talent? Being a personality, honestly, to tell you the truth, I'm just one of the lip-syncers. -So that's your talent? -Yeah. -What do you do? -What do I? I'm a YouTuber. I do comedy vlogs, um, three times a week. And how many subscribers do you have? -Um, 4.2 million. -Million? Yeah. So, what makes your start posting videos of yourself on YouTube? What made me start posting videos of myself? I'm really into myself, so I like seeing myself on videos. So I kinda just started making videos, I don't know. And your parents? Like, when you started? What did my parents say when I started? Yeah, what did they say? They were confused, but now they're staying at my house, and they're having a good time. They still don't understand it, and I don't think they ever will because-- Do you understand it yourself? Do I understand? I'm starting to. People recognize you, taking pictures -- It's crazy. It's just a number on a screen, but then when you see all these people in real life, you're like, "Wow, these are actual human beings that are watching my video." Did you expect that when you started? -Um -Did you know that you would be famous or something? I don't know that famous is the right word, but I believed in myself. I definitely didn't doubt it, for a second. But yeah, but, no, I definitely didn't expect it to be going great like it is right now. What the hell? [Asri] Who are you? -[laugh] -Um, she's-- Who are you? [Asri] No, no, because people take picture with you. -Oh, yeah. Her name's Karina. -Oh! -[Asri] Okay, and what's she doing? -She's on YouTube. -She's a YouTuber? -Yeah. Can you follow me on Instagram? -Huh? -Can you follow me on Instagram? -Sorry, I can't. -No. I'm sorry, man. Okay, yeah. Just follow us on Instagram, we're all about makeup and beauty. Right up their alley. Oh, perfect, just follow us on Instagram! -[Asri] What are you doing? -Hi! We're doing this, it's a contest. You can enter it to win a thousand dollars, but WeSearch is all about finding the perfect beauty product that meets your needs. Connecting vloggers, and beauty products, and helping people find both. If I want to win $1,000, what am I supposed to do? -Follow on Instagram. -That's it? -That's it. -So this is how you can get followers? -This is how you can get followers. -By giving $1,000? -It's one way. Yeah. -Okay. Okay, cool. -Because I'm trying to get followers. -You are? Well, we're trying. We've got some ads. But I don't have $1,000 to give away. -I know, it's tricky. -It's very tricky. So this is our candy that we're dangling, and hopefully people will come on. -Thank you. -There we go! -Alright. -Okay, bye! [indistinct chattering] [Asri] Hi. Do you work for Instagram? -Huh? -Do you work for Instagram? We work for a third party company that helps Instagram with this. Why? What's up? No, because I need followers on Instagram. I mean, you can, uh... -Anyone from Instagram? -Huh? Is there anyone who works for Instagram here? There's developers on the other side. -The other side? Okay, thank you. -Yeah. Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Sorry. Do you work for Instagram? -I do. -Ah. So how can I get followers? -How do you get more followers? -Yeah. My number one suggestion would be to... Do you use hashtags already? -Yeah. -I would try to use targeted hashtags. So, like, what do you do? I don't know yet what I'm gonna do. Okay, say you were like, a chef. Basically, no. What I'm asking is, can Instagram provide me followers? No, we don't do any sort of like-- -You can't give away followers? -No, no, no. Nobody on Instagram can, sort of, buy followers-- We don't like, give people direct followers. -In your algorithm, you can't like, send me followers? -No. We never do that. How many followers do you have? Me? Not very many. Maybe, like, almost a thousand. And I work for Instagram. So, like, even the people who work for Instagram aren't, like, famous. [Asri] Okay, so the people who work for Instagram are not famous. But Kevin Systrom, who created it, is. There are people who have built their careers on these platforms. Just by getting reach, and by having, you know, you need talent, you need to do something interesting -- [Asri] Nothing was really interesting during this conference, so instead, let me introduce you to my new BFF. [Asri] Do they have bitcoins here? I don't know. It's not my business to know. -You have to go away here. -I have to go? Yes, you have to go. Or else I call the police. [applause] That was awesome, so thank you very much. And, uh... So we're gonna move right along-- Kevin! The Verizon industry keynote. [up-tempo music] [Asri] Can I take a picture with you? This is only for PR. Just one picture. I come from Dubai. 18 hours. You can turn around and do one. -One, two, three. -Can you follow me on Instagram? Can you help me to have followers? -That I can't do. -No? How can I...? -You just gotta rock it. -Really? I just need 10,000 followers. After, I'm good. -[woman] No. -Okay. [Asri] I've had enough. Even the CEO of Instagram can't help me. To be honest, when I started, I thought that it would be easier to get followers. But I'm not the only one who's looking for them. In the social class of this online world, we are hundreds of millions trying to gain status. Everyone is trying, but no one really knows how it works. -We're not famous. -[Asri] Not yet? -Nope. -We're not even close. [Asri] But what were you doing right now? We're shooting for our Instagram. And why? To be-- So we can get free shit. -[laughs] -So you want brands to give you money and clothes? -Yes. -Yeah, just, like clothes, mainly. -Yeah, mainly clothes. -How many followers do you have? -2,000. -2,000. Okay, and do you have friends who approach you, or not yet, or how it works? No, yeah we don't really know how it works, sorry. We wish we could help you more. Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. But in life, there is no coincidence. Sometimes it's all about fate. Khaled Mohammed Khaled, known professionally as DJ Khaled, is an American record producer and DJ. In late 2015, a number of Khaled's Snapchat videos detailing his key to success received significant attention on the Internet. DJ Khaled shares his day-to-day life, including the birth of his son, Asad, AKA, his executive producer on his latest album. My son is the executive producer, not only on this song with me and Beyonce and Jay-Z, but also my new album that's coming out this year, my 10th album, and it's called Grateful. [Asri] This newfound online recognition made him really popular. He became an Internet phenomenon. He's even been called a living meme. Snapchat has pretty much changed the game, and he's the reason why the game has changed, because of Snapchat. Social media now is extremely important. Uh, the younger generation, they want information now. They want it fast, they want it quick. And social media gives you that avenue, gives you that outlet, to get information so fast, so quick. If you wanna know where I'm gonna be, I just look on Instagram, "Hey, I'm here." Boom. "We're coming." And why do you think that these people are following him? Well, I mean, Khaled is one... Everything about him is just real. So, you know, the things that he do, you know, him in the shower, using cocoa butter-- They key to most success is using the right soap. I only use Dove. Dove soap. Trust me. Uh, people like that because it's real, it's authentic. It's not staged, it's not fake, it's not staged or anything. It's all real. And everything that Khaled gives you on social media is all real, all authentic. And people, they gravitate to stuff like that. And, last question, do you think he planned this or it just happened? I don't think he planned it, I think it's just the evolution. -Okay. -I think it's more, it's more organic than anything. Um, I've known Khaled for a long time, and I knew that he wanted to be a superstar, but I don't think he knew exactly the path for him to get there. And once he discovered the Snapchat, I think that was the platform for him to elevate to the next level. [Asri] I've listened to DJ Khaled for about ten years now, since the early stage of his career, and I can tell that his audience has changed since he started using Snapchat. Wait till you see this kid-- Look at this kid. He has, like, the best baby pictures in the world. Any baby would be lucky to have these pictures. -So cute. -Look at that, come on. It's crazy. [Asri] Today, most of Khaled's fan's are millennials who discovered his music on his social media platform. Snapchat transformed DJ Khaled's career, and turned him into a mainstream celebrity, as well as one of the top artists in the music industry. [up-tempo music] What's all this, bro? [Asri] The first thing I did was ask him about how he managed to get so many followers. He simple replied that all he did was be himself, put out positive messages, work hard, and be grateful to God, because God is great. There was nothing else to say. But when I asked him if he could help me to get followers, here's what happened : Dubai, Dubai, what's up. Follow my guy from Dubai, where? FollowAsri, A-S-R-I. We at the Best Buy Store, thousands of people out here. [rap song plays] ♪ Then they get mad when they use you ♪ I don't lie. ♪ The devil thought he had me ♪ ♪ But I rebuked him, got money and I'm still a daddy ♪ [Indian music] [woman sings in foreign language] [Asri] When you don't have money, you will do anything to get it. From the richest to the poorest, money has the biggest influence on all of us. So I wonder if it's the same for those influencers. If you're doing it for the money, you're doing it for the wrong reason. 'Cause if you're doing it for the money, you're gonna end up doing things that you wouldn't normally do. And if you're doing something you don't normally do, you get sick of doing it. We cut down, like, most of the offers we got because, simply, it's a brand we don't believe in, or a brand was telling us to say things I usually don't say. I wouldn't take a brand that would put words in my mouth. I think it's so important to... to build an image for yourself, and build a reputation, and once you've built that, it's so important to protect it, and look out for it. If I'm out there promoting a brand that I honestly would never wear, it wouldn't make sense to my followers, and they would lose their trust in me. [Asri] Let's think about the concept of following. In life, if you follow your mom's advice, or friend's advice, it's based on trust, so I guess it's the same thing here. Think about your own behavior. Um, if your friends recommend something to you, whether it's a restaurant or a particular hotel, or it's a particular country, that peer-to-peer recommendation is infinitely more powerful to you because you're more likely to think that person is like you, and there's an enormous amount of trust. Of course it's part of the job to mingle with people, to socialize, to post, 'cause if you don't go to events, you have nothing to post, or if you don't take photos, you have nothing to post. So people always wanna know what's new. People want to know what you do every second of your life. Uh, everything is seen on my social media, even my kids are there. When I travel, I take my fans with me. They see what I like to eat, they see how I exercise and how often I exercise, they see who my friends are, they literally get to look into my life. When it comes to privacy, it's completely fine. I mean, putting my life out there, it's the way I live it. If you like it, you like it. If you don't, I don't give a shit. Maybe from one year, I reveal everything. Hello, Snapchat! I am here! I am eating this! Oh, my God, I wake up! Then my father stay with me and tell me "Don't reveal everything." Because you don't know who want the good for you, and who want the not good for you, who want to destroy you. If someone want to hurt you, he will know, where are you. You know from what? From your Snapchat! I think, and I feel bad, I shouldn't be saying this, because it doesn't matter where you live, you need to be cautious about exposing, not just my kids, but me, but, of course, more importantly, my kids. But again, there's a sense and a feeling of living in Dubai, I feel very safe. [Asri] And Dubai is very safe, but I can tell you, Paris, not so much. Kim Kardashian, the world's number one influencer, learned that. On October 3rd, 2016, at 4 a.m., Kim Kardashian was tied up at gunpoint in her hotel room, by robbers wearing police uniforms. And guess what they were looking for? A four million dollar ring that she had posted a few days earlier on her Instagram account. Following this robbery, Kim Kardashian disconnected from social media for more than three months. After the investigation, 16 people were arrested by the French police. But the ring, still not found. If I wanna be an influencer what am I supposed to do to be an influencer? I don't know, what's your angle? What's your story? Why do people care about you? I don't know, why do people care about Kim Kardashian? She's hot. I don't think people can just wake up one day and say "I want to be an influencer." -No? -No. I think you become an influencer, or you start to be seen as an influencer, when you have a point of view on a subject matter. When you're consistent, when you wake up every day and create content about one thing again and again. And when people start to find that interesting, they follow you. And then you become, or you get seen as an influencer. [Asri] Why do you think people are following you? Um, look. If we will go in the direction of, oh, because of "looks," I would say no. Looks are a part of us. But they don't make people love you, and follow you and wanna know more about you. People only look at everything on a superficial level. If it's not visually engaging immediately, they don't look beyond the top layer. They don't peel it back, and ask a question. Which, I think, is what photography is meant to do. [Asri] Have you ever heard of Louise Delage? Louise is a 25-year-old Parisian girl who rose to social media fame and gained more than 50,000 followers in just 8 weeks. But it turns out that Louise Delage does not exist. She is just a character in a marketing campaign about alcohol addiction, created by a group called Addict Aide and BETC France. Thousands of people commented and liked her pictures without catching on. So if people don't really pay attention to what we are posting, then why are we posting? What makes you start posting pictures of your life on social media? I think for me, um, the best way to change someone's perception is to show them how you live. You know, to show them the real you. To show them that really we're all the same. That we're all the same. That we all want the same things in life. So when they can see pictures of my wife and I at dinner, in our traditional clothes, if they can see the picture of my family and I on our religious holidays, they can connect with that. They can connect with someone's life. And they can look at it and say "We're all the same." Before social media, people didn't really know how other people were. You were very limited to the place you live in, or the place you travel to. So I think there is a very big misconception about Saudi women, that they're oppressed, that they can't work, that they do anything. This is actually really wrong. I always say this, to my viewers, that we are the generation of change. Because there is a lot of things changing now in Saudi Arabia. And girls are really more standing for themselves. I think it's because I'm trying to break the norms. Many people found it weird that a local Emirati guy is cooking, and in the kitchen. Many people did not like that as well. So a lot of negativity went around. Everyone's like, "This is wrong, this is wrong." And you start thinking to yourself, "Is what I'm doing wrong? Is it against the culture?" And I saw that it's not against culture, it's not against my religion, so why are people criticizing it? So, why not be the one who is gonna open doors for the ones that are gonna come after? It wasn't really accepted by the society. They didn't accept a Saudi girl posting her pictures to the public. So it was something big, it was something huge. I got a lot of negative comments in the beginning. But you know, this is what I love, this is what I want to do. And I'm glad I changed that. Because a lot of people started accepting it. And they're actually interested to know what girls can do. And that girls are working, girls are traveling, girls are seeing the world, and it's much different than how the people see it. Because it's all the media ever covers. Its 100% of the media of the Arab world, or very close to that number is all about the negative news. Because it captures headlines. Because it sells. Because it just adds more to the narrative that they are trying to create for this part of the world. However, it depends on us as followers. What do we give attention to, even if it's something negative, we create the buzz. We start mentioning to our friends look at this, and look at this, and look at this. We make them famous. And we have to blame ourselves. You know, social media has taught me a lot, not just in terms of social media, and what it is, but it's made me realize that you have so much impact on people that you will not believe it. I think what a lot of people following us don't understand fully is that we're selling you a vision, a dream. So... you might see me in the latest Lamborghini, but the followers won't know that Lamborghini lent me that car for a week to be promoting it. The more followers I have, the more responsibility I feel about what I share on social media because it's such a huge responsibility. So I try to take it seriously, and I hope that all the people who are actually influencers and have people following them, they take this really seriously. Because the power of social media, or saying anything on social media, is crazy. [Asri] And social media has an impact on users, according to a study published by the Royal Society of Public Health that surveyed 1,500 users in the UK. The study ranked social media from positive to negative impact on users. In all of social media platforms, YouTube has the most positive impact on mental well-being, while Instagram has the most negative. People are looking at other people's lives and seeing how exciting they are. And how perfect they are. And they worry that their own lives just can't match up to it. Young women, and girls, are so bombarded on all fronts by pictures of the ideal woman, and what the ideal body is meant to look like. And when they see it from influencers or perhaps even their friends, these images of perfection, which are just completely unattainable. So, we'd like to see social media platforms identifying for users when an image of a person has been digitally manipulated so that people are aware of what is real and what is not. Obviously, we don't want to curb users' self-expression or their freedom to edit in the way that they'd like. But we don't want that to come at the cost of self-esteem of vulnerable people. [Asri] Instagram was found to promote a few positive factors. But overall, it increased many more negative factors, such as anxiety, depression, body image, and fear of missing out, to name a few. So many young people don't... aren't taught to think about the impact that it has on how they're feeling. They don't stop and think about, "Oh, this is making me feel a little bit unhappy." So that's why we want to see classes and lessons in schools to teach people about having a healthy relationship with social media. So that they can be equipped with the tools to have a really positive relationship with it, and get the very best out of social media, and sort of mitigate the negative impacts. [Asri] If children and teenagers don't have the tools to realize the impact of social media on their mental health, they also don't have the tools to understand what they agree to give up when they create an account on these sites. So I met with Jenny Afia, a lawyer at Schillings, who rewrote Instagram's terms of use. Yes, so I was part of a digital task force, which is a group set up by someone called the Children's Commissioner, in England, who is there to protect children's rights. And we were looking at what it's like being a child growing up in the digital age. And, first thing we realized is when a child downloads something like Instagram onto their phone, they have no idea what they are signing up for at all. And if you look at the company's terms and conditions, which are 17 pages long, and they're written in really complicated language that most adults can't understand, let alone children. So we took the 17 pages, and we stripped it down into just one page, in just plain English and we gave it to children. And then they could actually see what they were signing up for. [Asri] And these are the terms that children, adults, and all of us agree to. "Officially, you own any original pictures and videos you post. But Instagram is allowed to use them and can let others use them as well anywhere around the world. Other people might pay Instagram to use them, but Instagram will not pay you for that. Instagram might send you adverts connected to your interests, which they are monitoring. You cannot stop them doing this and it will not always be obvious that it is an advert. Instagram may keep, use, and share your personal information with companies connected to Instagram. This includes your name, email address, school, where you live, pictures, phone numbers, your likes and dislikes, where you are, where you go, who your friends are, how often you use Instagram, your birthday, who you are chatting with, including in private messages." Instagram can change these rules whenever they like, whether you notice it or not. I want all social media companies that know that children are using their sites to make the terms and conditions easy for children to understand. A third of all Internet users are children. But the Internet just wasn't designed with children in mind. But all these companies like Instagram, they know that it's people under 13, under 18, using their site. Do you have feedback from Instagram? Did they contact you after that? They put out a very vague statement saying "We take children's rights seriously." But they haven't changed the terms and conditions. Actually, Instagram is just one example. Most of the companies have similar terms and conditions. We just picked on Instagram because it's so popular. -But this is a contract, right? -Mm-hm. If you're underage, you can't sign a contract without approval or signature from the parents. So how is this possible in digital? It's different because, in theory, there's no money involved when the child signs the contract. So it can be enforceable legally because the child is not spending their parent's money without them knowing about it. But, if the children don't understand what they're signing up to, then it's not an enforceable contract. It's not a proper contract. Can we sue Instagram as a parent? Can we sue Instagram? If you can show they've suffered some harm, yes, I think you could. It would be in America, because they are an American company. Okay. But it's possible. It's gonna happen at some point. Yeah. In English law, there's an offense called "intentionally inflicting emotional distress". And you could say that companies like Instagram, they know that it's causing upset to children, but yet they keep letting children on the site, so that they can make money. So, you could say it's this offense of the intention to inflict emotional distress. I think there would be a case there. -Do you think you can win? -Yeah. -Do you have Instagram? -Yeah, I love Instagram. -You have Instagram? Can you follow me on Instagram? -Yeah. -Yeah. -Oh. Okay, I will follow you. Yeah. You can follow me. I don't post on it, I just, I love Instagram 'cause it's just visual. The NSA specifically targets the communications of everyone. [Asri] I don't know if I love Instagram or not. But I know that since I created my account, I developed a weird relationship with my phone. And there is this French artist called Soprano, who can explain it better than me. [sings in foreign language] To say that someone is addicted, it has to have an impact on other aspects of your life. Right, so if you're getting ready to go to bed, and you have some down time for 20 minutes, and you're checking your phone, you're probably not addicted to it. But if you're checking it constantly, um, maybe you checked it during this interview, that would be a sign of an addiction. Because it's interfering with your work. Or interfering with your home life, right? So, if you are constantly checking things that don't even really matter to you, or you don't even care, you're just doing it because it's a habit. It starts out as a habit. Habits can turn into addictions. [Asri] Do you think that Facebook and Instagram, they designed these applications to make us addicted? Yes. They have their own research, you know, uh, team, and it's very private. I don't know anything about it. But they do their own research, it's behavioral research, you know, um... to understand how people react to the apps and to the technology that they're creating. And then, they design it around that. How can they create something that makes us addicted? You know, I mean, it's not like drugs, or, like, cocaine, -or, like, I don't know what. -But it is like that. The reason is it stimulates the same part of the brain that an alcohol or a drug addiction would stimulate. So those chemicals that come, you know, that you feel, when you get a like, or when someone you like texts you, or, you know, something like that happens, it's the same chemicals that are released when you have an alcohol addiction or a drug addiction. It's not natural to carry a machine around with you all day. You know, it's just not a natural behavior. Sitting in front of a computer or having a machine with you all day is not natural. And so it's changing the way that we think, the way we behave, the way we formulate our ideas about the world, or the way we formulate our opinions about other people. Um, and it's all through this artificial device. [Asri] As far as we know, throughout history, humans have always wanted to communicate with each other. To exchange ideas, learn from one another, trade, travel, discover new things and influence other people's beliefs and culture. Media has become the number one tool to communicate, and, therefore, to influence us through the news, through radio, movies and television. Our brain never sleeps. It is constantly stimulated by everything around us. [Asri continues] In this age of hyper connectivity, where we have 24/7 access to an endless stream of information from all over the world, we are under constant influence. So, are we still able to think independently? [rewinding] I think, right now, it doesn't make sense to distinguish between social media and media. And the answer to the question "Is media an influence on users?" Yeah. Absolutely. Media is probably the most important, most powerful influence most of us have in our lives. If you think about it, there's only so much of the world each of us can see every day. It's the places we are, the places we go. Through media, we can see the entire world. Or we can see a very limited part of the world. So what we see through media really governs how we see the wider world. At this point, I don't see any line between social media and other media. They cross over all the time. So it's enormously important and enormously influential. So what does an influencer mean? Let's take it back a step. I mean, I think that communications agencies have always done influencer relationship marketing because we've always mapped out stakeholders that matter to our clients business and how they can help advocate or change the perception of that clients' business or brand. The world "influencer" has a lot of meanings nowadays. Some people would tell you nobody has the right to say they are an influencer, or whatever. And some people would say no, they are influencers because they actually can influence. For example, if I eat a burger from here, I'm influencing people to go there. So some people would say, "Yeah, then he is an influencer." Some people would tell you no, an influencer makes positive change. So you help people think, and use your reach in a positive way, to change a community or whatnot. And I try to do that more than talk about hamburgers. I think an influencer has to be something good. To change the people, changing the things or thoughts of the people. As easy as this. Influencer is a person that influences people. I don't like that term that much, because everyone is giving themselves that title. And I don't think people can influence others unless they are doing great things in life. So I don't think if someone is just going around taking pictures that is someone who is an influencer. But, unfortunately, they are putting a lot of people under one bracket and calling them "influencers". Instagrammers, YouTubers, Snapchatters, there are a lot of terms. But they are all bundled under this term of "influencers". And this is just a marketing term that we use. Not all of them influence but all of them are called "influencers". I'd never call myself an influencer, and I don't believe I am an influencer. I'm one voice. You want to talk about influencers, you talk about, you know, Martin Luther King, talk about Sheikh Zayed, you know, all these people who have changed the way we live, who have changed the way we think, who have pushed the world forward. With or without social media. That is an influencer. If I need social media, all right, to keep pushing my story, then am I really an influencer? No. Because I rely on a tool to help me. But if those tools disappeared tomorrow, and I could still change things in the world, that's a true influencer. The first time I felt, and I believed that I really had an influence, was, like, a few days ago. There was this case of a little girl, who is like, 14 years old, and she got a virus and she's been hospitalized for about, like, two months. And nobody could manage to send her to London, and could afford her fees. So we did this campaign to support her. And she was actually sent to London today. We can do good, and there is a lot of good in social media. You just can't see it. I see so much going on around me, and so much that doesn't matter, and people are focusing on that. And there is so much that does matter, alright? Like supposedly, it's actually in a couple days I think, at the end of the month, I'm supposed to go to the Za'atari Refugee Camp in Jordan. [speaking Arabic] [man sings in foreign language] [children shouting] [explosions] [speaking Arabic] But if I can get people to care about something and actually make a difference in something, this is, like, the true value. So this is how you can influence people. Yeah, this is where the influence is useful. 'Cause, okay, influence to make somebody buy a certain brand of water or whatever, fine, right. But influence to make somebody care about a cause, or donate to a cause, or volunteer their time, that's much more valuable. -[Asri] I'm gonna finish on this. -Dun dun dun! [both laugh] Thank you, Max. Thank you very much. -Can we take a picture? -Of course. But wait, first, I want to Snapchat you. [speaking Arabic] You guys have to all follow him. [man sings in foreign language] [Asri] Wait, wait, wait, it's not finished. I forgot something. While I was in the US, I received an email from a company called "Mighty Mug", that makes travel mugs that won't fall over. After sending me a few emails, they invited me in their office in New Jersey. -[man] What's up man? -Hi. Asri. -Nice to meet you. -[man] How are you? How's it going? -[Asri] Good, good, good. -[man]Come on in. Just, pour your drink into it. And you can see, like, you can really hit it. It's about seven pounds of pressure. -Pick it up above the line. -Here? -No, above the line. -Oh, okay. See? Now try it from the bottom. See? Look, this is natural. [all laugh] So, one thing that I have been thinking about with the smaller influencers, with the people that don't have big followings, but they have potential. Like, whether they are funny, or they're doing some cool unboxing thing, is to get them while they're early. Right, so, get them the sample, you know, figure out something that they're happy with, but, basically bet that, in the future, they are gonna have a big following. So get the exposure now, pay for maybe one or two exposures, maybe three or four, have them do one now, and then do another one a year or two years later. [Asri] While I was there, we signed a social media influencer contract, where I agreed to promote their product in this movie for $1,500. [up-tempo music] [Asri] If I asked you to follow me on Instagram, would you follow me? Of course, why not? Yes. [speaks in foreign language -I would die-- -[Asri] Can you follow me? No! I followed you now, are you happy? [Asri] I'm gonna try to have, like, have 100,000 followers in two months. Do you think it's possible? In my dream, it's to have 100,000 followers. Oh! That's it? -It's a small dream-- -I can make your dream come true. I'll shout you out after this. I wanna know, like will you be able to help me have 100,000 followers? -100,000?! -Yeah. I will do my best. Okay. Yeah? [Asri] What can you do to help me be invincible? I can give you a shout out... -You'd give me a shout out? -Yes. -Sure. -You'll follow me? I'll follow you, okay. -Sure? -You don't have to follow me. I'll follow you. I promise you, I swear. -Yes, I'll follow you. For sure. Yes. -Follow me? -Yes, of course. Yes. -[Asri] You'll follow me? -Really? You'll follow me? -Yeah. -You'll follow me now? -Okay. Guys, me and Asri just shot something really exciting. -Good luck for you. -[Asri] Thank you. And your movie and your influencer career.
