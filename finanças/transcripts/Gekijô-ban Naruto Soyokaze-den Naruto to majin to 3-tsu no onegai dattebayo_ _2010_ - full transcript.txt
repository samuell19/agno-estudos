I'm Naruto Uzumaki! All of us are usually on missions for villages that request help, but everyone's off today, so we organized a genin grill party! I don't really understand. If we're having a group picnic, then why are we all separated? So, what should we talk about? Hey, Naruto! Eat some veggies, too! Why? Sasuke-kun's only eating meat. Sasuke's allowed to. Why just him?! Is there a store somewhere around here? I think I saw some vending machines. I see. I'll go check it out. Okay. We got it... Hey! Don't touch that! It's Kakashi-sensei's fault for leaving us here. Hey, pass the sauce. What do I do with it? What's this? What are you doing? What's that? Huh? There's something in it. After a thousand years in there, I'm finally free! The world is waiting for me! "Who am I?" You'll find out... in a second! Yes! I am the famous Genie of the Lamp! So, that means you get three wishes. Anything you want... Naruto, the sauce ... Hey! Listen to me when I'm talking to you! What's he going to do? Naruto, don't talk to it! It looks suspicious to me. I'm not suspicious! I really am a genie! Yeah, right. Hey! I told you not to talk to it! I'm the real deal, honest! A genie can't lie! Give me ten servings of meat, then! Your wish is my command! So you really are a genie, huh? You're awesome, Lord Genie! Well, of course I am. Now then, you still have two more wishes! What's next? What do you think? They shouldn't be wasted on something simple, like money for example. Wouldn't those be the easier ones to make, Sakura-chan? I'm being realistic here! So, what will you wish for? You still haven't decided? Well... Naruto, stay out of this. Huh? You already wasted a wish! So what if I did?! Well, what's your next wish? Shut up! Wait a minute! Okay, take your time. You're down to one wish! Hey! No, no, no! I take that back! The rules don't allow that. Why not? Refer to the third paragraph of the instruction manual. Oh, it's true. So, what's your last wish? Don't be hasty! Why did you do that? There's only one wish left. What do we do? Looks like it's going to take a while for you to decide, so I'll wait in the bottle. All right. Just give up on it already. Why should I? I found the bottle! What are you talking about? You already wasted two wishes! You don't get to make the last wish, got it? What do you want to wish for then, Sakura-chan? Well... Something meaningful, of course. How should I put it? "I love Sasuke, and I want his love all to myself!" See ya! I'm gonna make myself Hokage! Naruto! Naruto, stop! Did you all see that? Yeah. If that's the real thing, then we can't ignore it. I'm getting that bottle! Kiba! That's not fair! I gotta go! How troublesome. Naruto-kun. I'll spare you if you hand that bottle over. Fat chance! I'm gonna be Hokage! I figured you'd say that. Let's go, Akamaru! Man Beast Technique: Fang Passing Fang! (獣人分身・ 牙通牙) Jūjin Bunshin: Gatsūga What are they doing? Hand over that bottle! You too? Why do you care? This isn't like you! So what's your wish? You're wrong! I don't need to explain anything to you! Fire Release: Phoenix Sage Fire Technique! (火遁・鳳仙火の術) Katon: Hōsenka no Jutsu My turn! Stop it! What do you think you're doing? Both of you only want your wishes to be granted without you putting any effort into it. Am I right?! That aside, aren't we a team? Or was that all just a lie? You're right. It's pretty stupid to fight each other. You lost it! Look at what you did! Now she's getting away! That wouldn't have happened if you hadn't chased me! I'm going to wish for Sasuke-kun to love me! There it is, Forehead-Girl! Ino-pig! What do you want? I want the same thing you do, of course. What? I bet you're only thinking of wishing for kinky stuff! Oh dear, what gave you that idea? Shino! The bottle that I desire is now in my hands. Give it to me! You lost it because you were too busy arguing with each other to notice me. Does that make me insignificant? It's okay. I'll tell you a few things about myself today. Listen... First of all, my favorite color is moss green. My favorite flower is the chameleon flower. Naruto! I'm gonna be Hokage! Naruto-kun, I would like to have that bottle also. Bushy brows? What are you planning to wish for? For even more resolve, and for even more of the passion of youth! Wouldn't that only make you even more brutal? Shadow Clone Technique! (影分身の術) Kage Bunshin no Jutsu Tenten! Lee! Why are those three working together? They want to get the bottle first, then decide who gets it amongst themselves afterwards. I see. That's an effective strategy, I guess. Sasuke-kun, we could— Well, you tried! Sasuke-kun, wait! Where are my teammates? Now, hand it over. Naruto! Give us that bottle! We'll help you out here, then we'll settle it amongst ourselves later. Bastard! No way! Now beat it! Keep it up, and they'll get that bottle! Please believe us! Interesting. If you were him, would you trust someone else with it? If you give it to them, it could be their very wishes that end up destroying it! Give us the bottle instead. Naruto, believe in us! Take this! Good job, Akamaru! Give me that bottle! Akamaru, think of a good wish! Thanks! Hell, no! Like I'll let you have it! So, where's the bottle? There it is! Way to go, Hinata! Give it to me! What are you talking about? If you give it to someone else, give it to your own teammates! Give me that bottle! Hey, Hinata, give it here! Shut up, you! He'd use it for something stupid! What's that? I just wanna be Hokage! Hinata, what are you doing? Give me the bottle! Hinata, here! Here! Hinata, give me the bottle! Quick, Hinata! Because of this bottle, you've all resorted to something like this. If I smash it... This is bad! Do you really intend to do that? But the innocent spirit inside it is... I know that. My body is... Shadow Imitation Technique, successful. Shikamaru! You bastard. Listen, everyone! Who cares what you say?! You can't have the bottle! Settle down, already. There is a way for everyone's wishes to be fulfilled. How? You can just wish for even more wishes. Can we do that? As expected of your above-200 IQ! I'm going to open it. I was starting to get bored waiting for you guys. Have you decided what your final wish is going to be? Yes, we have! Then let's hear it! Our last wish is... Hey, someone give me some change! Those machines don't accept can refunds. Your wish is granted! Ah, thanks. You're welcome. See you again in a thousand years! What was that? What's wrong with you guys?
