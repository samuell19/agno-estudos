No, no, wait. Hey, what's going on? You guys talking upstairs? -Okay? -I'm okay. Hello? -Alicia? -Speaking. Who's this? Alicia, Hi, this is Sharon Warman. Mrs. Warman? I'm sorry, I didn't realize. What can I do for you? Listen, this is kind of last minute but Peggy's father, I think he's had a stroke or something. Anyway, she's had to fly back home, so opportunity knocks. Okay. How can I help? Well, we kept this hush hush in the agency but a high profile client needs an assistant, someone with discretion and zeal. Peggy says you're it. That's kind of her. Who is it? It's Desmond Gage. Desmond Gage? Yes, but he's in Green Valley and we need you here today. Green Valley? Where's that? Close to Arrowhead, the middle of nowhere. Let me get you the address. [bell dings] -Alicia? -Miss Warman? -Hi. -Hi. You made it. Yes, thank you so much for this opportunity. Oh, don't thank me. Thank yourself. You made quite the impression on Peggy. Hollywood 101: build bridges. -Yeah. -Come this way. Well, there he is in the flesh. Wow. I'm sure you've heard the rumors. Are they true? Desmond is very private and he doesn't like labels. But if he likes you, he'll let you in. Oh, okay. Let me pull this out and I will show you your room. Oh, um, does that thing even work? Oh, yes. It worked so well that it drives him off his rails. This cabin is so cute. Your bathroom is here. Oh, okay. I get my own bathroom? Wow, nice. Okay. You need to hide this somewhere. Obviously, use it if there is an emergency. But if Desmond hears this ring, he will go ballistic. Oh wow, okay. Is the signal really that bad here? Well, just go ten miles in either direction, and you'll be golden. -Um... -Would that be a problem? No, no. Totally fine. Where can I put this? -Is under here, okay? -Sure. And where is Desmond's room? Downstairs in the living room. You walked right past it. I actually have to get back to the city, but... Oh. This is the movie's press release, as well as a copy of Inside Hollywood. I don't know if Desmond wants to see it. It's been hard to figure out these days. Should I be concerned? No. An actor is an actor is an actor. Just keep him company, and clean up after him and two of these a day. Oh, two a day. Got it. They're for his stomach. He always forgets. I don't know. He's sampling something new. Oh, and don't let the cat starve. Think I can do that. -Follow me out. -Okay. Well, welcome to the big leagues, kiddo. Thanks. Could you introduce us? Oh, he's actually focused right now, but I told him about you. Oh. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Aww... Hey, buddy. Do you want some food? Come here. Come on. Yeah, that's what you want. Okay. Here we go. There you go. There. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I was just feeding the cat. Oh, it's fine. You must be one of Sharon's. Yes, Melissa, I mean, Alicia. Did you just get your own name wrong? What I meant was my friends call me Lacy, and I know we're not friends yet, but if you wanted to call me... Lacy. Thank you so much, Lacy. I know this was very last minute. Yes, but super happy to be here. Come here. Oh, uh... I promise I will give you everything I got. Okay, I see you met Sylvester, that's good. Thanks for feeding the old devil. -Oh yeah. -You hungry? No, I'm fine. Let me get you something to eat. Let me just get the door. Can I help you with anything? Yeah, you can help me with this thing, I'm burning up. Oh, okay. Oh good. Oh, do you mind? -It's so dark in. -Oh yeah. Beautiful. All this stuff is organic. Sharon buys it at the farmers market, I think it's just down the street. Delicious. Can I get anything else for you? Just... yeah, tell you what. -Why don't you get a carrot? -Oh, okay. There we go. -Yeah, one more, okay. -Here you go. Great. You like carrots? -Yeah. -Good. Mmm. Mm. Yeah. What are you making? Smoothies. Everything the body needs. I drink two of these a day. -Are you a vegetarian? -[blender roars] There we go. -Voila. -Oh, thank you. That's dinner. Oh. Mmm. Mm. Wow. So, what's Sharon like as a boss? Oh, just great. Tough, but... thorough. You must know her assistant, Peggy. Yes. Technically, I'm actually her assistant. Look at Sharon. You're the assistant's assistant? Well, I mean, it's not bad. I mean, a few months ago, I was driving tractors in Arizona. -So... -Arizona? Well, that's a change. Yeah, I needed one. What's that mean? Well, I was just so done with the farm life, and last spring we lost a lot of money and it... Timing just seemed right. I do really want to be like Sharon, you know, follow in her footsteps. Are you going to drink that? Oh, yeah, of course. Mmm. You're a terrible actress. Sorry. Don't worry about it. We're going to work on that. In this town, everybody's got to act their asses off to survive. I know this stuff tastes like crap. I only drink it because of the screen. Got it. Speaking of the screen, do you understand what we're doing here? Yeah. Well, I know that you want to do some preparation for your next role. Preparation's cute. I prefer immersion. Immersion? Yeah, I have to immerse myself in my character, Lennox. So Desmond disappears. See, the audience has to forget every other role that I've ever played. Wow. Yeah. This is going to be the role of a lifetime. [sighs] I love this picture of mom. Yeah. Million dollar smile. Do you think I have her smile? Of course you do. You've got quite a few of her qualities. Really? Like what? Her eyes. Her skin. Unfortunately, you're cursed with my nose. I'm going to move to Los Angeles. Not today, not tomorrow. -Not for ten years. -Five. Eight. I made a promise to her. She loved Arizona but she missed Cali. I know. I love you, coach. I love you, too. And your nose. [chuckles] [sighs] Wow. [sighs] [knocking] Lacy? -Uh, um... -Shh, it's okay. It's just me. Uh, sorry. Did... Did you need something? You said you're from Arizona, right? -Yeah? -Well... I was thinking about giving my character an Arizona backstory. Okay. So I need to know how they kiss over there. [chuckles] Um... I... I imagine that it's just like everywhere else. Oh, come on, I'm being serious now. There's so many different variations. Like, intensity... And wetness. Passion. And flavor. Flavor? Yeah, you know? Come on, don't be modest. I know you just kissed hundreds of guys. Actually I... I've just been so focused on my future, I really... You're so funny. So tell me... Is this authentic? [panting] [chuckles] [laughs] [sighs] No, no, no. Please, take my health, but don't take my service. Ugh, damn it. Sucks. [chuckles] Well, good morning. Good morning, Sleepyhead. What are you making? My favorites, banana flapjacks. I learned how to make these from a Brazilian chef who put his own divine twist on a French recipe. That sounds amazing, actually. You have no idea. One time in Rio de Janeiro I ate six of these -in one sitting. -Nice. Oh, that reminds me before I forget I have your pills here. So let me just get two of them for you. Thank you. These are a lifesaver. Hmm. Mmm. So, how did it go last night? Um, good, I think. You mean, you can't tell? Not until the dailies. Like I said, I'm no longer Desmond. Can I ask what's the movie about? Oh, oh. You'll have to try this. Oh, okay. -Mmm. -Mm-hmm. Aren't they lit? -So good. -Right? Oh yeah, I can't believe you made those, you know. I feel like I should be making these you. You don't want all of them, though? No, no, no. Are you sure? I don't want to take... Oh, okay. So, you know, I do follow you on social media. 200 Bucks says that I know where this conversation is going. You want to know if the rumors are true. I mean, if we had service, I would totally Venmo you. I just love how you Gen Z brains get all lit up at the prospect of any frivolous meme. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that... is that really all it was? Just a meme? No. No, not this. Really? His name is Philippe. We met when I was on vacation. He was a barman on a cruise ship. -No way! -Yeah, way. I get so tired of hiding. Hollywood can be so suffocating. This is crazy. I'll let you know... I mean, I... I grew up watching you all the time. And I would have never known. Well, it's not like we all wear pink. Look, it's not something that you can really tell. I mean, obviously not. I couldn't tell. But... but you were engaged to that Italian actress, right? -Mirabella Anatusa? -Yes. That was a lifetime ago. I was very young and very confused. But look, it's not like I can't appreciate the female form. But truth be told, Sharon choreographed every step of that, all the way to the altar. -No, she didn't? -She did. Every detail. She would always say, Look, kid, it's the facade that pays the bills. And she's right. I just don't think that my fans would fall for a gay Romeo. Well, you never know. Look, I know it's a backwards thought. But back then, it seemed to make more sense. Wow. I just I cannot believe that she faked an entire wedding. Oh, believe it. You'd be smart to learn from her. She's very good at managing my career. I guess so. Are you ready? Set? -What? -Go. But... Hey, wait up. Desmond? Desmond! Where are you? [sighs] Desmond. [cat meows] [phone vibrates] Hello? Hey, Coach, it's me. Lacy, where are you? Oh, I'm in the mountains for work. There's no signal here. That sounds isolated. I think that's kind of the purpose. Have you got a number I can contact you on? I have an unknown here. It's actually... it's better if I just call you. Like you did yesterday? This is not exactly a vacation, Dad. Look, I just want somewhere to reach you at. I won't call you. I won't harass you. Do you promise? Promise. 909-555... Yeah... 2143. Was that so hard? Did your lips fall off? Oh my gosh. Who else is up there with you? Um, okay, you can't tell anybody, but it's Desmond Gage. Desmond who? Desmond Gage, dad. He's a huge actor. Mom loved him. That's nice, hon. Who else is there? Honestly, this is a huge deal for me, Dad. It's like the planets are aligning for me. I'm happy for you. But who else is there? Um... Well, it's actually just us two. -But it's great. -What? He's so nice, Dad. You're up there alone with him? You know how volatile these Hollywood types are. Yeah, but he's not like. He's so nice. They all act nice. Look. Why don't you go back to L.A. or come back home, please? Are you kidding me? My boss would kill me. They'll find someone else. No, I can't do that. Like that is out of the question, okay, but just... just know that Desmond is great and I'm good. And if I do a good job at this, I will get a huge promotion and I'll be able to send you money so that you don't have to sell the farm. I appreciate that, hon. And I thank you, but don't act like I'm wrong. They are volatile. Okay, you're not. You're not wrong. But I can handle myself. [vase shatters] I got to go, Dad. You call me tomorrow, okay? Okay, I'll try, coach. Okay, listen, I l-- Damn it, Sylvester! Oh. Stupid cat. Run away. [bell rings] Oh. -Hi. -Oh, hey. You're back fast, what are you doing here? You know, just... took a shortcut. [phone rings] Oh, uh... I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I just really wanted to call my dad really quickly. I-- Did Sharon not tell you? No, she did but I just... I was going to unplug it, but you were gone. No, you don't understand! What if this had gone off when I was in character? I know, like I said, I was going to unplug it so you would never hear it, but I just didn't get there in time because the vase broke. Please. Please. It's fine. You know, I'm-- I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry. I... I didn't mean... Ah! God, I'm such a screw up. [music plays on phone] ¶ [bell dings] [insects buzzing] [fire crackling] [twig snaps] [shouts] Desmond? [Desmond groaning] Desmond? Are you okay? [spits] Oh my gosh, what happened? Are you okay? I think I drank too much wine. Are you sure it wasn't something else? What? I don't know. I don't know. I was immersing. It's like a black out. [vomits] [coughing] Okay, I'm going to call Sharon. This is nuts. No, no. Please. Don't bother her, please. I just need to rest. Please, help me. Let's get you up. Okay, okay. Come here. Okay. I got you, I got you. Let's just get you to your room. All right, almost there. [Desmond groans] Ugh... Get under the blanket. Okay. Oh, I have your pills for you. What pills? For your stomach. No, no, thank you, No, I'm fine. Um, okay. Is it okay if I just run to Arrowhead? I just want to call my dad real quick. No, just sit down here, sit down here for a second. -I just want to rest. -Okay. -Just for a minute. -Okay. Oh... You're a good assistant. I'm so glad you're here. Thank you. Thank you. [clock ticking] [groans] [coughs] Ugh. [coughs] Good morning, miss. Morning, officer. Is everything okay? Certainly, it looks that way. Excuse me? Rangers saw smoke here last night. They thought this place was vacant, so I thought I'd give it a checkup. Yeah, we just arrived from L.A. the other night. And you come all the way out of here, why would you do that? Uh... 75 degree weather in L.A. isn't amazing enough for you? Yeah, just for work. You know, me and a friend. -Fun times, fun times. -Yeah. All right. Well, you and your friend stay warm. -Oh, we'll try. -Okay, now. -Okay. -Good day. You too. [coughing] ...you have dialed has been disconnected or is no longer in service. DESMOND: But yes... In all honesty... I just want to get... Desmond, stop resisting. Sir... Desmond. Oh, ah! I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I just was... I heard voices and I... I should... I better go. No, no, it's fine, please. I'm glad you're here. Can I show you something? -Come here, come here. -Yeah. I don't want you to get your expectations too high. Look, this is really dumb and silly, but I know you're bored out here, as am I. So... Okay. See, I told you it was pretty damn stupid. -It's... -No, no, not at all. It's stupid. No, I mean, there's only so much outdoor stuff you can do. You're just trying to protect my feelings. No, I really actually love puzzles. So... Come on, let's do it. -You sure? -Yeah. I haven't done one of these in years. I know, me neither. Can I get you some wine? Oh, no, I... I shouldn't drink. -No. -Water's great. No, I must insist. This calls for a celebration. Voila! Nice. I've been saving this for a special occasion. Thank you. So what should we toast to? Um... To new things. Yeah, to new things. Not bad. Yeah, I... I detect a hint of... Grapes. Maybe, you know, just a little bit. Did you miss me? I sure as hell missed you. Um... It gets pretty lonely up here, as you well know. [chuckles] Yeah. You make me so... I don't mean to, uh... -I'm sorry. -No. I'm sorry. No, no, it's okay. What? What are you saying? Do you know the story behind the Taj Mahal? No, I don't, actually. An Indian emperor built it for his wife who died in childbirth. Most people think that it's a wedding gift. But in fact, it's a tomb. Which I think makes it even more romantic. Yeah, I guess it does. When the emperor died, he was laid to rest next to his wife. Now they're together forever. Wow. Um, wait, wait, um... Uh... What? Um... Are you... Are you sure about this? Very. ¶ [panting] When we're together... the world stops. And life is complete. Hey, there. I'm looking for an address. I do have a phone number for the person I'm looking for. Um, can you help me with that? Name's Harry Johnson. Looking for my daughter, Lacy Johnson, she's working out there, and there seems to be some kind of complication with the phone, and I'm getting a little worried, to be honest with you. It's 909-555-0143. I appreciate this. Mighty kind of you. Mom? [panting] [sighs] Desmond? Desmond? [bell rings] Hey. Buongiorno, Bella. How are you doing? -Really good. -Good. Could we, um... Can we talk about last night? Yeah, what about last night? Did something happen? You're joking, right? All right. You have my attention. You don't remember. Remember what? You don't remember anything? Okay, you know, it wouldn't be the first time that I offended someone while I was immersing. I know I can be insufferable. I just don't remember why. So if I said something that was rude or inappropriate... I apologize. [panting] I'm stupid. Damn it! Please, please, please, please. [panting] [bell dings] [sighs] Come on! Angie? Best I felt since I've been back from the war. The best I've felt since I've been back from the war. The only love that I've felt since I've been back from the war. Back from the war. Back. Back from... It's the first time I felt love since I've been back from the war. Why the war? How about ever? Ever? Honestly, honestly, sir. Honestly... Sir, I think we got started on the wrong-- No. No, no. Again. In all honesty, sir, she deserves happiness. I just want to get... Desmond. Stop resisting. Sir. My friend... Desmond. Desmond. It's okay, I got ya. Just let go. And trust me. [sighs] [cat meowing] [music plays on phone] ¶¶ 745, wellness check. [police radio chatter] I was in the area. [knocking] Hello, miss? Hello? Excuse me, sir. Why don't you come out here? Sir, I just want to talk. Sheriff's department. Come on, let's have a talk. Ah! ¶ Hey, show yourself. Ah! Dispatch, come in. Dispatch! What are you doing here? Just got a call about the girl that's staying here from her father. That old bastard. He's trying to take her away from me. He's just worried. Please. Please. Any updates, officer? All clear. Copy that. Thanks. Hey, you don't need to do this, okay? No one... No one needs to know about this. Shh. It's nothing personal. [groans] [coughing] [sighs] [music plays] [singing in Italian] Last night was a lapse of judgment. What? Can you turn it down? Dance with me. I just tried to say that... Shh. Dance first. Talk later. Can I just get something off my chest? Please. [music stops] What? Last night. It was a mistake. Did you not enjoy yourself? Well, I did, I just... I think I'm... I'm the problem. Come on, don't give me that crap. Be straight with me. I'm sorry, I'm just so confused. I don't know what you want. I want last night all over again. I just don't think that I do. I'm sorry, I just... [sighs] I'm just trying to make... I know we shouldn't. I know it's wrong. Do we always have to be so logical? What was that thing you said the other night? About the world? When we're together, the world stops. And life is complete. ¶ What's the history of that? Oh, that's... that's my friendship bracelet. My best friend gave it to me. Can I try it on? You want to try on my friendship bracelet? Actually... I want to keep it. I want to remember this. Remember you. And what do I get? What do you want? Your underwear. No, really? Oh, you're a kinky one, aren't you? And can you sign it? Okay, I was wrong. You're not kinky. You're deranged. Come on, let's see. Let's see. Okay, just be really careful with it, its super special to me. Oh... I like it. I love you. A lot. ¶¶ [thumping] [phone rings] Hello. Lake Arrowhead Police Department, please hold. God! Thank you for holding. Yes, my name's Harry. I called yesterday. Sir, we left you a message. Everything's fine. And I requested that my daughter call me right away. Did the officer tell her to do that? Sir, please calm down. I'm trying to stay calm, sir. I haven't spoken to her since Tuesday. It's now Friday. You get it? As I already told you, sir, Green Valley's a couple of towns over. They don't have a police force. It requires coordination. I'm not asking you to cure cancer. Sir, have you considered that maybe she's just busy? Yes. Yes, I have. Now, can I speak to someone who can chew gum and walk at the same time? Lacy? What now? I can't find Sylvester. What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean? Is he in your room? -No, no, I was just there-- -Go check! I was just there, he's not there. You must have left him outside. No, did you check under your bed? I checked everywhere! What did you do last night? Were you in your room at all times? Lacy, answer me! Well, after we fooled around, you took me to your room and I was there for a bit. Then I went upstairs. What did you just say? That-- Did you interact with me last night during my immersion? -Well, yes, we... we... -We, we what? We fooled around, you know, that. No, I don't and no, we did not. Stop lying. If I was lying, how did you get my bracelet on your wrist? You took advantage of me when I specifically asked you to stay in your room and out of my way! I, you're... Please just shut your mouth. Your conduct is unacceptable. I have no choice but to tell Sharon. You know, I'm just going to go look for Sylvester, because I bet you I can find him. Here, Kitty, Kitty. Sylvester. Here, kitty, kitty. Damn it. No. Um... Do you... Can you help me change my flat tire? You didn't find him yet, did you? No, I'm sorry. I looked everywhere. I need you to call Sharon. That's a great idea. I need you out of here. Clean up this mess and pack your bags. I said, call Sharon. I can't because you broke the phone jacks when you ripped it out of the wall. You don't need the phone jack. All you need is to connect the wires. I'm going to be in my room. Would you just have this cleaned up before nightfall? Or just be in your room. Okay? Wait, you're rehearsing today? No. I'm going to quit acting and move to the Alaskan wilderness. God. I'm sorry, but I really... Have you packed yet? Just really need your help to either fix the phone or help me fix my car. This may surprise you, but assisting the assistant assistant who was supposed to be assisting me is not part of my job. Figure it out. Please just help me fix the phone, I just... I just want to call Sharon, and I'm really, really sorry that obviously I'm not a great match for you, but I am just a glorified receptionist. You know, I... I answer calls. I manage schedules. I obviously do not belong in Hollywood. Okay, tomorrow. If I feel like it. I just want to call a cab. You know, like I will literally send a tow truck for my car, and I just want to be back in Arizona with my dad, and you never have to hear from me ever again. I said tomorrow, okay? Okay, if you're not going to help me, I will literally walk back to L.A. Why wait? God! I don't know what kind of sick, twisted games you are playing. But there is no way that you can be blaming all of this on me, Immersing and completely disassociating like it's an out of body experience? Whoa, that is my job. You know what, if anything, you have been taking advantage of me and I've just been too blinded by your stupid status to even realize, but you know what, I... I am going to tell Sharon everything. And I am leaving tomorrow. That girl's gone crazy. Can I help you? You must be, uh... Darn, I forgot your name. You must be trespassing. This is private property. Name's Harry. Lacy's father. Nope. You're lost. Lacy! Dad? Dad? Hi, sweetheart. What are you... How did you find me? I'm just passing through. I'm so happy you're here. Just wait for me in the car, I'm going to get my stuff. I'm leaving with you. What's wrong? I'll tell you when we're on the road. Now you're leaving? I'm sorry. We just... We have a family emergency. I have to go. Are things always this strange around here? No, it's fine. We're great together. Good. She never takes this off. She's never this flustered. Look my friend, I think we got started off on the wrong foot. Hmm? I'm allergic. I want to make your daughter very happy. What do you mean? Well, look... I'd like to ask for your permission for her hand in marriage. Is that a joke? No, of course not. I realize there is an age difference. Listen, you may be a nice fella and all that, but I need to get her back home. You understand? Family. [thump] Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad! Where is my dad? Do you really want to walk away from everything we have together? Did you not hear me? Where is my dad? You are my soul mate. What are you talking about? Wait, wait. What? We're destined to be together. No. No, we're... you, you're freaking crazy. Let me go! Let me... Dad? Dad! Dad! [bell rings] Angie? [clattering] Do you know the story behind the Taj Mahal? And here I thought our age difference would be a problem. When we're together... the world stops. And life is complete. [gasps] No. No. Angie. Angie. Angie. You down there? [gasps] [banging] Hello? Can anyone hear me? Please. Please, help me. Angie? Angie? Angie? Are you down here? Angie? Angie. [grunts] [shrieks] [engine sputters] Dad! Dad! Run, Lacy. Run! Her name is Angie! [shrieks] [panting] Where are you going? Come back. Angie? [sobs] Dad, Dad. Dad. Daddy. [sobbing] Daddy, wake up. Daddy, you're okay. You're okay, Daddy. No! Angie. Why did you run? I'm sorry, Leo. You're my angel. Baby... ...if you run... I don't care. You and I were meant to be. We're soulmates. When we're together... The whole world stops. And life is complete. I love you so much, Angie. My name is Lacy. Suspect down. [beeping] Oh, hello, I'm Dr. Baggett, I'm the attending physician. Hi. The nurse mentioned someone was here. Are you a relative by any chance? No. I am her boss. Oh, okay. How's she doing? She's stable. We had to induce a coma for the surgery. A projectile penetrated really close to her heart. Bottom line, she's a really lucky young lady. Yeah, it's good. Don't worry, we're monitoring her. We'll probably bring you back in a couple days. Oh, by the way, I wanted to wait for a relative, but since you're here, maybe you can help us. We found this in her possession. Two of these a day. They're for his stomach, he always forgets. I don't know, he's sampling something new. What's that? Haldol. It's an antipsychotic. It's normally used in the treatment of schizophrenia. These are a life saver. I had never heard of that. Was there a name on it? No, I checked the system and didn't see any outstanding prescriptions, but you know what? It's probably samples or something. -Yeah. -You know, and it's all good. I'll just ask her when she wakes up. Yeah, but I do have to get back to my rounds. But if you need anything nurse's station is right there, downstairs is the food court. But don't worry, she's in good hands. Thank you. Awesome. Lovely meeting you. You have a great day. So sorry.
