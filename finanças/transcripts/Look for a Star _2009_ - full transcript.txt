Grooming herself for it is nothing Teaching her girl to dupe men is canny I picked out some gifts for you to send her No, she doesn't want them Otherwise she wouldn't have returned the pendant You know, she's the kind of girl who thinks a $84 fish... deserves a dignified death I know you're upset, but I'm happy for you Why do you say that? Because you're in love whole-heartedly And why do you say that? Normally, you won't waste a minute But you've been waiting for two days You taught me to give her time That's what I'm doing Let me teach you something else Love is tolerance and patience I wouldn't dare teach you anything But if you love him, tell him He's an honest bloke You're too weird, no one can read your mind This is serious What happened?

The sillier a woman is, the more she loves you She's very different from us Nothing I say will change your mind Don't worry, I can manage If you're worried, buy her a house or stocks I'm not worried because I have you That's why I told her your nickname You were daring even as a kid It's hereditary. You're just the same - Give me a hug - Come on Take care - Okay, bye - Bye, Auntie - Watch your step - Bye - Hello, Sam - Hello Hello Hello Hello Finally, nobody will say he's gay Not us, I mean the magazines You mean the international edition of Empire? They listed Sam's criteria for his women It was a mile long. Did you read it? I'd rather not Or I'll have a headache and can't sleep I remember one: Brains and looks Connections, tastes and fertility What happened? They picked on you? No, they were nice They asked stupid questions? I just didn't know what to say to them For real... I can't even remember their names That's easy, I'll tell you There's Ada, Sharon and... We can go if you want No, you should go back in, I'm OK I better not I'm not fond of them They shoot off their mouths and wear low-cuts I only like low-cuts on you Teach me how to dance Come on - OK - OK Well? Left or right? You tell me - Left - Left? - OK - Left Left. I stepped on you Come on, lift it Ready What's so funny? Stop You said it You're most honest when you're truly hungry Tell me, will you marry me? I love you, I love you My love for you surpasses everything My love for you will never change Take good care of Milan Just tell me I do I love you, I need you Listen, from now on I'll always be there when you make a wish I love you, I need you I miss you, My love is true Loving you, you are my only one My love for you surpasses everything My love for you will never change Everyone sent you their congrats What are you saying? Get to the point Point No. 1, the shareholders and business partners question your fianc??e's background Getting married is our business, not theirs That's pertinent to Point No. 2 Your second wife... got 1/3 of your assets at divorce which was, of course, your personal assets but now you own a corporation... in other words Milan's background... increases the risk factor What are you proposing? Say it A prenuptial agreement that stipulates, in the event of a divorce Milan is entitled to a limited alimony only so that she won't be a liability to the corporation I don't want this Think of something else This is your Mother's idea You're back - You're practicing? - Yes Carry on, you can read this later What is it? Nothing, some company document I'm the chairman A major loss in my assets is detrimental to the company at large What is this? A prenuptial agreement You must understand my position The company's interest is top priority What if I'm just saying what if we get a divorce, you're entitled to my... I know this is ludicrous But I must protect my company and shareholders They need protection If we want to get married... we must sign this We getting married is none of the shareholders' business Just tell me if you choose to give up If he wants to count, give him babies Make him pay for each of them So what if the agreement is very thick? Charge him by head counts Don't pout That's like getting paid to make love A big fat zero for orgasm You're wrong The zeroes in your bank book is your orgasm One zero. Oh Two zeroes. Ohoh... Three zeroes. Ohohoh Understand? - Morning - Morning, Sam What is it? The toast is no good? I gave you a double Enjoy it This may seem complicated Trust me on this Auntie didn't go to the casino? She didn't want people to think she's selling you to pay her gambling debts She wouldn't go even if you make her We dare not shop for groceries in case the paparazzi find out what we eat You can't go out? I dress like this to cook at home It's the same as going out Jean Paul and I may not be rich We still want to present you as a lady Jean Paul? I'm Jean Paul She's Tiffany, you're Milan - We're all famous brands - That's right You're home early I called you I forgot to bring my phone I'll hit the shower Dinner is ready, let's eat first I ate at my Aunt's She has a phone, why didn't you call me? I want to take a shower first Go ahead Are you asleep? What is it? Can you forget about the agreement? Yes lt'd be perfect if you're not the Chairman I'll sign it, good night Before the commercial break Let's review how John met Zoe He's secretly loved Zoe for 3 years but never had the guts to tell her Now you finally have the guts to tell her If you love her so much what took you so long to tell her? She's better than me in every sense What was her reaction? I had no intention to tell her that day I only wanted to meet her for dinner and talk about that later and she agreed But on her way to work the next day She had an accident What happened? She died Come over here I want you to tell the audience Why did you decide to appear on "Follow Your Heart" Because I still love her very much I'm sorry I didn't tell her I loved her in three years until now. I regret it So what if she turned me down? At least she'd know someone loved her You're very brave, John John bared his soul to us We should give him a big hand Give me a pen Let me explain this No, I don't want to know All his ex-wives signed this? No, he never thought of it Simply because... his company expanded too quickly This is actually his Mom's request Sam would never tell you in case you feel awkward when you meet I have a request too If you ever get a divorce she'll donate all that she'll get to charity I'm OK with it But before she signed it why did she add such a provision? Because she found out the agreement was your Mom's idea How? Sorry, slip of the tongue I see - Miss Kwok - What is it? Someone to see you from the TV station Mr. Ching has no media appointment today They asked for you Me? "Follow Your Heart" It's a hit matchmaking show You're kidding Look, Uncle That's my license plate Yes, MI 3211 You have such a good memory Queenie, do you have gifts for other uncles? Queenie Get up. Go study in your room Say goodbye to Uncle Bye Bye I don't want Queenie to follow my footsteps and have people look down on her Is this OK? OK OK Self-knowing, self-overcoming, self-changing before loving someone Sign up if you want no regret. We're waiting We'll help you follow your heart Sharky No man has ever made me so happy yet so... miserable But it's worth the misery You think it's OK... for someone poor to be with someone rich? Unless the man is spending the woman's money What's wrong if the woman is spending the man's? Here comes your problem Hello I learnt a new trick I'll grant you a wish that will come true Try it I want to marry a billionaire Stop kidding around I'm not I thought I'd be OK with it How hard is it to spend money? I'm a woman. I can become a rich woman But I can't We're worlds apart I can act dumb when I'm with you, right? But when other people say about me I really want to... You're the one I love Why should they make me sign an agreement? You're OK with it But has it ever occurred to you I'm not OK? Forget it Tell me now Will you marry me? Right now? Right now Right now, the answer is no You should go, I need to practice Sorry I go on TV and accept a contractor What will people think of me? No Not me, it's him What will people think of him? That's so mundane Don't you care what people think as long as you love him If someone tells me... she loves me on TV I'd go for it in a heartbeat Then why didn't you tell her you love her and let her jump at the chance? - No - Why not? Because I'm a man Men Men must save face and women mustn't? I can't live with myself It'll be too humiliating Humiliating - I'll go, I don't care - Utterly humiliating Leave him alone, don't beg him He's just the chauffeur - Chauffeur - He's lily-livered Silly driver You don't have to go with her I will - Oh, yes - Go my ass Do you know where we're going? - Of course I do - We're not going swimming I heard you. - You're offering happiness - Over there - and try to find a taker, right? - Exactly You're drunk. This is not a game Jo will get hurt because of you Who do you think you are? - Sam Ching. When Sam Ching wants a woman - Sam Ching she'll come flying in from hell I'm Sam Ching and I'm loaded, so what? An idiot proposed today with a ring - She said no - Who did? No. So what if I know she's the one I want She has to know that too Forget the rest. I'll tell the whole world I love Milan - Good - I have decided to go with you Yes. You are a good boy He's bad. We go Let's go Wait You're such a pain I trust you. If a man proposes on TV will a woman say yes? If I can do it any woman can do it Anything goes Trust me Anything goes? Absolutely Come, let's shake on it Good We'll all go Com'on Follow your own heart Milan, you're struck by Cupid's arrow Look over here What TV station is this? Shannon, you're struck by Cupid's arrow What are you doing?

All men are equal when it comes to love You must follow your heart for love and bliss Let the show begin We have 6 special guests tonight but only 5 of them showed up We've been trying to call... Mr. Ching's girlfriend but there's been no answer Mr. Ching, you're welcome to leave now before Milan refuses to make an appearance Can you handle that? We'll see how long you'll last Now, ladies and gentlemen Let's give a warm... welcome to Mr. Lin Jiu our unemployed surrealist and warrior of love Hello Aren't you a bit overdressed? I need not respect your show but I respect love Good comeback For that, I'm giving you a chance to tell us exactly how lowly you are My name is Lin Jiu, I'm from Shandong where I worked for a theatre troupe I came to Macau 2 years ago to look for a job How sad But that's alright. Now, let's see how outstanding your Jo is Jo, you graduated with honors at the world famous University of Texas Your current position is? Company Secretary of Mannequin International A multi-billion dollar corporation You know the meaning of Company Secretary? Here's something for you to learn A Company Secretary is only second to the CEO Mr. Lin, you simply have no idea what you're up against Let's give him a big hand You're wrong You said on your show even with the possibility of rejection it's worth it to let her know someone is truly in love with her You... You also said on your show Right here, Love asks for nothing in return And here's my favorite line Today's hesitation begets tomorrow's regret - Also... - Enough, Mr. Lin Please stop quoting me Look 1.3 billion people are behind you Make good use of this moment to fight for your happiness OK, let's hear it I came here to say Most people would think I'm not worthy of you We are more than miles apart But I have a right to love I'm here... to fight for happiness to give her I simply want her to know that Thank you That is truly touching But what good will it do? What do women want from men? Power Jo is an outstanding woman in Asia You're an unemployed worker Will she wait for you to crawl your way up? Give Mr. Lin a mirror Let him see how good a match he is for Jo Don't play him for a fool That's what he gets for screwing up He's fired while he's still on probation - Am I right? - It wasn't anything major He made... minor changes to the design Minor changes? Ladies and gentlemen, why don't we take a look... at Mr. Lin's minor changes Here's the original design and this is his Jo, you have seen this before, right? What do you see? A glass inside the circle A glass? Technically that's a champagne flute Jo's schedule is so busy she doesn't remember... the champagne flute or that she has given it away To Jo, this champagne flute... is nothing but to me, it's very important This is the first present she gave me I cherish it No wonder Mr. Lin treasures the flute It's not an ordinary glass It represents his undying love Nothing matters on my checklist now It's the heart that counts Allow me to love you for the rest of my life Yes It's a success story Congratulations You may proceed to our Throne of Happiness This is Milan, leave a message I'll think about calling you back, bye Milan, it's Sharky You're one step away from finishing the dance Shannon, how many blind dates have you had? Too many, I don't remember Too many Bringing your daughter along every time? Were you worried about that? Most men would have a problem with that You're not afraid they'll laugh at you? No No I come from a poor family I don't know about being afraid My husband had an affair when I was pregnant I survived that Whether or not people look down on me won't stop me seeking a man who loves me Ladies and gentlemen, a true warrior of love Give her a round of applause Louder Louder Now I want you to give Tim the loudest boo you can manage OK. We boo him because he's too fussy Tim, I really want to know why you caused such pain to these poor souls? Here's your chance Go on stage, if you're a man and explain to Shannon From the start, Shannon knew my problem But Queenie changed me A child is simple You like something or you don't Adults have too much to think about I'm a fussy chauvinist I was indecisive. I even bought a ring but somehow I screwed up To Queenie I did what a father should do I picked her up from school. I played with her I held her when she was too tired and let her sleep on my shoulder We took lots of pictures When I looked at those pictures I realized I had never smiled like that So happy So sweet Can you... give me another chance? Uncle Queenie Mommy Another success Congrats to you and to our show for making another match Please take your seats Step over to your throne Thank you, Tim I'm very happy today We matched up 2 pairs With half pair to go Mr. Ching, you're on Nervous? I find it weird that Mr. Ching asked you to appear on that show But he's right for you, you're both crazy Play a trick on him on live TV ask him to strip dance Just remember You'll be happier if you can be silly You dare to step on stage, Mr. Ching? Would you like to try... the Throne? Will a miracle happen... in the next few minutes? It will You think so? Look over there No answer No answer since the show started Will it be better... if you call yourself? I bet there's still no answer Maybe you need to show... your good faith I'll give you one minute Explain yourself in front of the camera Maybe, just maybe she'll take your call OK When I was little, I heard on the radio Happiness was a crystal ball It was shattered as it fell to the ground Everyone can pick up the pieces Everyone has the right to embrace happiness However hard you try, you can't have it all But you'll get some if you try I believe in that I think... she also believes in that Dial the last number. Scared? The phone is ringing Is he my Rem? Still no answer The clock is ticking It's time I announce there's no miracle tonight You're a rich man, you get special treatment I don't like you, but I'll give you another chance You can buy 1 second with $1 million How much time do you need? Time is running out, make up your mind 5 4 3 2 No thanks Time's up A failure I pronounce Mr. Ching a failure in love He can take his seat, alone. Please Ladies and gentlemen, as you can see all men are equal when it comes to love Even billionaires lose their brides let alone a jobless man If it's meant to be, it'll be If it isn't meant to be, you can't make it so How about I report you... for lecturing me? I believe no good deed is never lost Why is everyone so nice to you? Because I'm nice to them No one asked me to trust them before Because no one else is nice to you You shouldn't gamble if you work so hard I want to go learn dancing in USA Thank you That's all for tonight Thank you, bye Mr. Ching, actually... I'm fine I understand Why she didn't show up I don't think I need to wait till I'm 100 When I was little, I heard on the radio Happiness was a crystal ball It was shattered as it fell to the ground Everyone can pick up the pieces However hard you try, you can't have it all But you get some if you try I believe in that Why? I didn't do it on purpose I don't want people to stare I'm sorry You said love is our own business I remember that, I really do I'm not ready for your world OK But I'm ready to let you into mine Will you marry me? Now we're even Come on Bring it on
