It is not this village. Oh. The road is blocked, we must go around. Fine then. Hey, Director, how do you feel about those two actors who played Drime Kunden and Mande Zangmo yesterday? I do not think I can use them. Their costumes and the rest are good. I also agree. You were going out of your way to help his wife. What was with you? I was starting to feel embarrassed. I saw that, too. This boss would do anything. Don’t just sit there laughing. Do you have something with her? It will get you in trouble. Even me. I would not do that with everyone to see. Then what is with you? Hand stretched out, giving money, attending to her. You wouldn’t understand. Sometimes I have a flashback when I meet someone and it comes back to me. Don’t talk in circles. What happened? Tell us quickly. That girl made me remember my first love. What? Your first love? Right. That girl is just like my first girlfriend. Go on and just tell us. You can say that a girl took with her the love in my life. I still cannot forget her. Tell us about her. If I tell it it will come back to me all over again. We reached Nyemo Village. Akhu, who is the namthar caretaker in your village? I cannot really hear well, speak to me louder. Who is the one that takes care of namthar performances in your village? That is… he went somewhere. He went to collect firewood, in the valley. I can send someone for him. Boy, come over here. Run over and speak to Akhu Dorje. Tell him to come home. Guests have arrived. Over there? I cannot run so far. Today kids will not listen. So naughty. Do you go to school? I do. I give you this pen. Study hard now. Now run and call him over. What do they do? They’re film makers. We are making a film. Akhu, do you know what a film is? No! In Chinese it is dianying. Film! Oh, yes, yes. A while back showed on a white cloth. Isn’t it that? They were nice, really something to look at. The eyes would bulge out at them. Are they still around nowadays? Akhu, you are well informed. These days everyone sits around and looks into a small wooden box. The Story of Tansen Lama is really interesting. Sometimes you suddenly see a boy and girl touch their lips. It is hard to watch. Many people watch films in the cities nowadays. I know nothing about such things. I am making circumambulations. Let’s go together then. We are here searching for an actor to play Drime Kunden. We have two extraordinary Drime Kunden and Mande Zangmo actors. Unsurpassable. Their acting brings everyone to tears. Could you have them come here, so we could take a look? The Mande Zangmo actress is my neighbor, she is here. The Drime Kunden actor graduated from high school this year and became a teacher in the prefecture seat. He says he will not be able to come here for Losar. If it is so we will not be able to put on Drime Kunden. The boy is unexcelled namthar actor. He also likes it. Back then, he even acted on a television series. Really? On television? That is correct. Can you remember what the television series was called? What was it… I forget. It is from when he was small. He acted quite well. Pity… Acting Drime Kunden since he was small. If he does not come it will be a big loss. That is what I am thinking. We have no hope of replacing him even then there would not be enough time for practice. How is the girl that plays Mande Zangmo? We also need someone to play Mande Zangmo. As far as that girl goes she played Mande Zangmo in all the villages around here. She is unequalled. Quite a lively Mande Zangmo. Honestly between the two of them, she is the better. Could you call her here and let us have a look? That is possible. Boy, come here. Go and tell A Je Drobe to come here. I am too tired now, I cannot. Such an useless boy! You will not go? Take this and buy yourself a notebook. Take it. Akhu is telling you to study hard. Take the notebook money for the sake of study. In the future, do not take money. Thank you, Akhu. From now on I will go wherever you tell me to. Here are some namthar head dresses. Do you want to see them? Oh, sure. These? These. These are the masks of the tiger, leopard, bear, mule, wild dog, wolf, and other wild animals that threatened King Drime Kunden and his wife on their journey to the land of Dud Hahang. This is the mask of the Grizzly Bear. Grizzly Bear. Poisonous Snake. That is the Black Poisonous Snake who exhales clouds, from the land of Dud Hahang. Fearsome and terrifying. This is the tiger’s mask. As Drime Kunden and his wife were returning from Dud Hahang, various wild animals such as a tiger, leopard, bear, mule, wild dog and a wolf grew attached to them as if they were their own parents and solicited them to remain in that place. Drobe, the Mande Zangmo actress, is here Shall we meet her? Oh, yes. I have brought A Je Drobe. She is Drobe, the Mande Zangmo actress. Girl, take off that scarf. How about letting us see what you look like? What is with you? They have come here looking for actors to play Drime Kunden and Mande Zangmo. Unless you take off your scarf how can they know if you are suitable? I am sick. I feel cold. Fine, don’t show us your face. Are you able to sing a bit from Drime Kunden? Sing it, sing. I will sing about Drime Kunden offering his three children to the Brahmins. Sing that. Our exquisite children, like the sun quickly veiled in the shroud of the Brahmin’s clouds have vanished like gale ravaging through my fruits… She sang beautifully. Free and spontaneous. Girl, could you take off your scarf. Let us have a look at you? Akhu, follow me over here. She sings really beautifully. I have something to ask you. Tell me frankly and without reserve. She will not let us see her face, is it that she is unattractive? That is amusing. She is the most attractive one in our village. There are not many like her around here. Ask her if she wants to be in our film. I want to have her play Mande Zangmo. Let me go and ask her. Who knows what she will say. If you want to see what she looks like I will bring a picture. Does she agree to act? It is not that. She has something to ask of you. If you can agree to that, she says ‘Yes’. This is a picture of our theater troupe. She is in here. Take a look. I shall not. I look at the person. That and the person are two different things. If you need to, take it with you. It might come in useful. Yes, thank you. What is her dilemma? If you can let her meet her former boyfriend the Drime Kunden actor, act in the play, she will also act. Otherwise, she will not. What is that about? Her boyfriend is the boy who became a teacher in the prefecture seat. The two of them have acted in Drime Kunden since they were small. The boy just graduated and took the job as teacher. He met another girl and now wants to separate. Oh, I understand now. This is a touchy situation. The two of them got along really well. How could they stop now. How is the boy’s acting? The young man really can act. No one here can match his playing Drime Kunden. I do not even think the national theater troupe has someone like him. Tell the girl if she can keep her word we will see if we can have the boy act. Yes. What is it? She has something else now. She is asking to come along to meet him. Isn’t that something. If they are such a good match I will not say no. Is the young man’s acting that good? Is it worth going to see? His acting is amazing. You will realize once you see. It is because of you we will go there. If you are looking for Drime Kunden we have a living one in our village. Really? Really. Is Akhu Khalo going to be at home? Akhu Khalo’s sister is over there. Is she? Will you go ask her? Is Akhu Khalo at home? Is Akhu Khalo at home? Akhu Khalo is in. He is. That is good. Akhu Khalo is amazing. We do not often come by, so we do not really know. It is this way. Akhu Khalo! Akhu Khalo! I am here. Where is Akhu Khalo? This way. Akhu Khalo, is that where you are? We were looking over here. I am here. They are looking for an actor to play Drime Kunden. Hearing that we have a living Drime Kunden like you they asked me to bring them over. Yes, yes. Akhu, did you give away your own wife as an offering? That was back then when I was young. Why did you do that? When I was 30 or so the wife of someone in our village passed away. He was also blind. Three-four years later, he still had no wife. Then I thought I am a few years younger than him. I have both my eyes. If I gave away my wife, I can still find another. So I gave him my wife. Right. Did she agreed to that? Do you have the right to give her away? I do not have the right. Back then we had a discussion. She agreed, and I gave her away. Did you love her? We loved each other and got along well. We lived together for 10 years. Never even had a fight. Akhu, If someone asks you to offer your eyes would you do like Drime Kunden and give them away? If they need them, I will. How can I give them? If I give them like Drime Kunden what will another do with them? You might not know, Akhu, but science has really progressed When people die they can give their eyes to others like Drime Kunden. What good are a dead man’s eyes. They are useless. You still do not understand. They have restored the eyesight of many blind people. If science is so miraculous I will give my eyes before I die. I am getting along in years. I have seen everything I need to see in this world. If another has need I have the power to give them away. Akhu, you are a living bodhisattva. I didn’t think, there would be such a person these days. That is really true. Akhu, we are making a Drime Kunden movie this year Would you act in it? Am I like that? I am old, I cannot act in a movie. Do not ask that of me. You are a living Drime Kunden. Tell them ‘Yes’. Whatever I have, I can give to you. I cannot act in a movie. Respect my request. Akhu, the one we have been searching everywhere for, in reality, is just like you. If we need you in the future we might come back looking for you. Goodbye for now. I am grateful. In the future, do not look for me. I cannot do what you ask of me. Now be on your way. - Akhu, goodbye. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Businessman won’t you now tell us about your love experience? I am waiting. I feel asleep. I could tell it but it is embarrassing with such a young girl in the car. Precious merchant, don’t be so shy. Spill out your insides. I can’t wait to hear. This story cannot be told with such a girl around. I beg of you. Will you tell it? Oh, I should explain something beforehand. Where are you taking us now? I used to be a monk. Now the story has become even more troublesome. „The Love Story of a Monk”. You should not say that. That was after I returned to laity. Even better now. Get ready! Let me just think. I will tell you. Suddenly you cannot remember? I surely can, it is crystal clear in my mind. I was going to Labrang. When I arrived at the bus station it was afternoon. There was nothing there so I stayed in the hotel. Then I went to buy a bus ticket. There, this girl wearing seeing glasses, otter-lined skin robes, about seventeen or eighteen. Such a beauty. She was wearing seeing glasses? Yes, seeing glasses. She later told me she was a student. I don’t know what came over me, but back then the sight of somebody schooled would move me. I thought of her as one. I said, „Where are you going?” She said, „To Labrang”. We are both going there. There is no bus today so I am staying the night. ”I know”, she said. Hearing she is going to Labrang, I felt something inside. Having nothing else to say I waited facing away from her, waiting to buy my ticket. All of a sudden, she asked me „Where are you staying?” „At the bus station hotel”. „Is that safe?” „I don’t know, this is my first time. The room is good”. She decided to stay there, too. Feeling happy inside, I thought, „It is going well”. I turned back, bought my ticket, and then waited. While buying her ticket, she turned back, saw me and laughed. I also laughed. After buying the ticket she came over and we left together to eat something. While eating, we talked. „Are you a student?” „Yes, I am”. „Where?” „In the Prefecture Middle School”. „A student, but you are not studying”. „So why are you drifting through Labrang?” At first she was coy but then she spoke frankly. Last year she took the high school graduation exam but didn’t pass it. This year she took classes in order to retake it. „Then you should now be reviewing”. She laughed „I do not worry, why do you?” Right. She was right. Then I had nothing to say. „Why do you not review for your tests instead?” She blushed, turned away and laughed. „I am bad at studying”. „I would rather go to Labrang and ask for a blessing”. Then I said nothing in reply. She was right. So I just agreed. Then we ate and she wanted to pay. I didn’t let her,I paid. She felt a bit embarrassed. When then returned to the hotel, she took a room put her things there, and we stayed. That is where you two got together? Not at all. We each had our own room. It’s not like that. Saying these things, I can see it play in front of me just like a movie. The next day we got up early. Our seats were next to each other, in the back of the bus. Along the way, the poor girl she became a bit dizzy. Then I put my hand on her forehead and held her up. She felt better and fell asleep. And one point she took her hair and brushed it away from her forehead. Then I leaned her forehead against my bare cheek, holding her close. That feeling is inexpressible. I had no idea how we arrived in Labrang. So we arrived. It was past noon. I took her and we prostrated in the Great Assembly Hall placed butter lamps, requested blessings. After that she was really happy. „If now I don’t pass the test to enter the university” „I will have no regrets”. Then we came back, paid for a room, and we both stayed there. After that she came to be mine. The next day she had to go to school. I went with her and bought a ticket. Then I put her in the bus. The bus was not leaving right away. She implored me, „I will not go to the school” „return the tickets”. She would not stop. „How can you?” „You have to take the test”. „You must go back and study”. She begged insistently. I just ignored her. Poor girl, tears running down as if she was on the threshold of death. After we separated, mother, mother, mother! I did not want to talk, did not want to work. Would flare up just talking to a girl. It was hopeless. Then that year my family planted beans. A lot of beans. It was hard to sell. I dragged a full cart to another village. Traded it for grain. Then I went home. No! Forget what I said. I took that to the county seat and sold it. Received 600 yuan. A whole year’s income. I put it in my bag. Coming back happily. I ran into a boy by the village clinic. „Akhu Drobe, Akhu Drobe!” „What do you want!” I said. ”You have a letter!” I knew it must have been her. „When did it come?” I asked. „Several days ago”. „If it came several days ago, why didn’t you give it to me?” „How could we get it to you?” That was right. I opened it quickly and took a look. It was hers. It pained me to read it. She wrote just how much she missed me. - And then... - Do you recall the entire letter? Not exactly all of it. Anyway, it was melancholic. She wrote well. „I miss you”. „Each time I miss you, I go up on the mountain behind the school”. „Thinking, eyes closed, you come back to me”. „I even do not want to study”, she says. Once I read that, I could not bear it. I made the boy take back the cart. I turned around. The grain money for the family a whole year’s income. The 600 yuan. I went looking for her right on the spot. Taking the letter. Taking the letter, how else? The letter also said „Should I leave my parents,” „should I separate from kin,” „I will bear no regrets”. „If we have to be homeless for life, I will be happy”. She wrote for real. Telling you this, I can just see it, like in a movie. It would be. Leave the end of the story for later. Oh, it is me. Yes, yes. We will not arrive before sunset. Will let you know once we arrive. Yes, yes. Oh, yes. Once in Rekong, a friend of mine will treat us. He says there is a young man who loves to act. He wants to be in the movie. Says to give him a try. Driver, stop here. Let’s make a rest stop. Oh, yes. #Mother is calling. [Stir-fry] I busted my gut. Now I know who this Chaplin is. Almost killed me laughing. I will search out his movies once I get back. I have to watch them. You have natural talent. You can also really mime. Have you ever played namthar? Never. However, it will come if I practice. He acts really well. Let him have a role in the movie. He would not be right as Drime Kunden but I will arrange a suitable role for you. Thank you. Then, Director, some beer? Oh, I do not drink. You have talent. In the future let’s wish for a chance to work together. Good, that is good. - How are you? - Good, good. They specially came to visit you. They are looking for an actor to play Drime Kunden. They came specially because they heard that you played Drime Kunden’s father. Yes, yes. Good. Come inside. Sit, sit. Yes. Akhu, what play have you acted in? I have never acted in Drime Kunden. I have played in Zukyi Nima. When I was working, I also played in the Fearful Rays of Dawn. Would you perform an act for us? How about an act from Fearful Rays of Dawn? I will play a commander. I still remember the words. Then act a part that you think is good. Yes. „Tserang Dondrub!” „You thief,” „I fed you food, I covered your back!” „Now that you have grown up, you stand against me!” Tserang Dongrub then calls me a thief. I reply „It is for me to vehemently state who is the hero and who is the villain”. „The Karang tribe has imprisoned you”. „If they rise against me, I will skin you alive!” Your act is really enthralling. I won an award for playing this role at the province level. Do you recommend any other actors from the Theater Association? Last year the Theater Association brought in some children. They are not bad. You should go and see them. Yes. Since we could not make it we should have a look. In that case, I will let the chairman know. From among you, the second, third and fifth girl step forward. The rest of you take a break. Have you acted theater before? No, I have not. Can you read Tibetan? I can. Then can you recite a stanza of poetry? I do not know any poetry. You do not know poetry. Are there any literary or poetry magazines here? Let me go and look for a Tibetan book. Yes, yes. Do you know how to sing? I do not. Here is an issue of Tibet’s Art and Culture. Give it to her. Recite a stanza from there. Here is a stanza from the Mirror of Poetry. Shall I recite that? Fine. „Whispering in soft murmurs” „Eyes cast far and wide” „Dove, tenderly entreating, towards” „Its lover shifting, beaks touching” That is a little too short. Read one more stanza. „The voice deprived of intellect” „Like holes in the earth” „Adorned with the virtue of knowledge” „Emblazoned with lotus leaves” Have you acted theater before? No. Do you know how to sing? No. Have you ever acted in theater? Never. Do you read Tibetan? I do. Do you know how to sing? I do. Sing part of a song. „Longing…” No problem. Start again. „Longing, longing” „Longing for my first love…” Cannot keep from laughing. You cannot sing? No. That is alright. It is enough. There is still one singer. Him. Have you acted theater before? No, I have not. You read Tibetan? I do. Now sing a song. Here is a Lhasa song I wrote myself. I will sing that. Yeah. „Letters of my youthful love Flurried back and forth” „Unable to read myself, Bashful to show to others” „Bashful, bashful Bashful to show others” „With A Ja far away Letters came aplenty” „She then returned Her robe already fastened” „Fastened, fastened Robe already fastened” The name of your troupe is the Theater Association? Have you never before put on namthar? We have not done that before. This year we are preparing one. I see. We passed through a village and brought with us a young girl that acts namthar. They can sing it really well. Really? Would you have her sing? Sure. Girl, come here. On their behalf, could you sing a short act? It is alright, sing. Sing. Just one act. Sing. Sing. Sing. „Excellent King, listen to me” „Not seeing my children before they left” „I let tears out from my loving heart” „Not as injury to disturb the King” „Rethinking that, my own heart aches” „To fulfill your wish, I shall take your heed” She sings well. Could she join our Theater Association? You would have to ask her. Really? Girl, do you want to be in our theater troupe? We are preparing a performance this year. All of them also come from the country. What do you think? It would be good. Think about it then. We will take care of it. I played in Drime Kunden when I was small. Really? Who did you play? The blind Brahmin. Really? The blind Brahmin. Right. Could you sing an act? Let me think… I forget the words. „Great King, bestow your charity onto me!” The King says „I have nothing left to offer as charity”. „Great King, make me an offering of your eyes”. The King consented and the blind Brahmin opened his eyes. „Miraculous! Miraculous!” „How many beautiful girls there are in this world”. I have forgotten the words. Let me have your phone number. We will keep in touch. When we decide to start filming we will call on you for help. We will surely help. Demo! Couldn’t you let me know you are coming? I just heard you were here and waited for you. You must come to my nightclub tonight. I know that you are looking for a Drime Kunden actor. One of my singers used to play Drime Kunden in his village. I am really busy now. Let’s meet tonight. Akhu Pema ye On your return, the youths rejoice Without you, my heart is empty Akhu Pema ye On your return, the youths rejoice Without you, my heart is empty Without you, my heart is empty He must be the director. You are looking for someone to act Drime Kunden. Right? Your patron told me you have acted Drime Kunden before. Is that right? That was back then. From a few years ago. Can you still act? I still know the story. Can you sing a couple of stanzas? The words, they will not come to me. That is alright. Whatever comes to you. If you ask me to play Drime Kunden I will not. Why is that? I dislike the role of Drime Kunden. Why do you dislike him? What do you think Drime Kunden exemplifies? Unsurpassable love and compassion. Fortitude and benevolence. Everyone says that. Drime Kunden offered his own two eyes to others. That is his choice. Has nothing to do with us. However, why did he have to give his wife and children? Where did he get the right to do that? Who gave him that right? Girl! Are you hiding there? Covered up in that scarf. Will you not show your face? Let your whole face be seen and drink with me. The pure scent off your body intoxicates me. Shall we drink a little? What do you do? I am from the country. I have also played in Drime Kunden, like you. Who did you play? I played Drime Kunden’s wife, Mande Zangmo. In that case, you are my wife. I now have to see your face. Fine for me to give you to another why not let me see your face? Why do you go around with them? I am going to meet my ex-boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend! Yes, my ex-boyfriend. He does not want me. Is there a point in seeing him now? Dimwit! She is going there out of love. Love! In these times, do you still think that love exists? If you do not even believe that! Does it matter if we exist in this world or not? You do not even know as much as an animal. Hey! Making paltry sums by shortchanging others and flattering yourself. Stop! Stop! Thief! Stop! Come back! Let’s fight. Come back here! I am not like that. Now, businessman you must now continue telling your love story. I am waiting. You want to hear it? I thought that you did not want to. Tell it. I am ready for it. Alright! Where did I stop yesterday? What point did we reach? What was it… The part where he took the letter and went to look for her. Oh! You remember it clearly. I would rather that you did not film it. How many years after you returned as a layman and met that girl? It was the next year. The year of 1993. How long were you a monk for? Ten years. When you returned to laity was it clear to you that you had to do that? Not at all. Just like that, returning to laity, ashamed. I strayed to Xining. I looked up acquaintances, businesspeople, various help, and so on. I really endured a lot. I was a newcomer to Xining. Cannot steal. Cannot rob. I lacked confidence. The thieves would call me „Akhu”. They would say to me „You will not get by like this. Let’s go together and rob, steal”. „I will not do such things”, I replied. I all truth, I have spent money they stole, I have eaten food they stole but I have never stolen or robbed. That is why many businesspeople trust me nowadays. Sometimes I would only have a single bowl of noodles to eat for four days. With no money for a hotel I would just walk the streets at night. Often I would stay up the whole night. It cheered me up when the street cleaners came out. I knew it was almost daybreak. They took me back home and had me do only heavy work. Frankly, many years passed since I became a monk. I was not able to work. Besides, our area was poor. There was nothing else but to go into the Forestry Bureau and transport trees. I did everything to get out of that. The family then sent me to Labrang to practice some rites and I met that girl. Slow down, slow down. Look at that boy and girl. See how consumed they are with love? Do they feel it like we do? That maniac of a scholar we met last night doubted how there could be love. What does he know? As for me, love is just that incredible. Let’s go now. #Mother is calling #Mother is calling Hello. Hold on. Driver, can you stop? I have to take this call. #Service unavailable #Service unavailable #Service unavailable #Service unavailable What is with your director receiving so many calls? Is something the matter? Cannot be anything serious. Must be some family matter. #Service unavailable #Service unavailable #Service unavailable #Service unavailable There is no signal around here. Let’s go. Businessman. If love is just such an incredible feeling go on and continue your love story. Not now. We are near a monastery. One shouldn’t tell amorous tales near a monastery. A monk like me saying such things around a monastery I will be reborn in the eighteen hells. Let’s go into the monastery. There are many young monks here. You said you need young monks. We do. Besides, they also play Drime Kunden here. The monastery also plays Drime Kunden? Yes. That is news to me. The monks act it. Then, who plays the female roles? If they need to play someone like Mande Zangmo do they bring a nun? Not at all. Monks play all the roles. Really? It is the first time I hear that. The monastery is right ahead. Let me out here. I need to go. Why? Will you not go in the monastery? I have nothing with which to offer a butter lamp. I will not go. That is fine. Let’s go. Can you wait all by yourself here? I am not going. I will wait here. Fine. You go ahead. Do not go too far away. Wait by the road. We will return quickly. Fine. What is your name? Kalsang Dondrub. What do you know? I memorized the Treasury of Aphoristic Jewels. Recite three stanzas from the Treasury of Aphoristic Jewels. Ok. „Even the wise person staggers” „The character of his actions is virtuous” „Even when fire faces down” „The burning flames point up” „The unfathomably learned scholar” „Solicits even other’s lesser wisdom” „Through such consistent practice” „He shall quickly become omniscient” „For the wise, yet small” „Powerful foes are insurmountable” „Though the lion is powerful” „The wise rabbit killed him” Besides that? What else? English. You know English? Say something in English. ABCDE… Now, you. What is your name? Jigme Gyamtso. What do you know? I just know prayers. Recite from the Taking Refuge prayer. „I take refuge in all the glorious, excellent lamas,” „in the compassionate root lama” „along with his lineage.” „Lord of the entire monastic community,” „source of the 84,000 dharma teachings,” „constituent of all qualities and enlightened activities,” „fortune of all tathagatas” „of the three times and ten directions”. Well. Now. You. What is your name? Jamsang. What do you study? Dialectics. You are studying dialectics? Then come here and show us. It does not follow that a hue must necessarily be red. Such is stated in the text. I accept it. It follows that a hue must necessarily be red. because a hue can be anything. The reason is unestablished. It follows that a hue must be anything because it is not a hue. The reason is unestablished. It follows that it is not a color because it is amorphous. The reason is unestablished. It follows that it is amorphous because it is immaterial. The reason is unestablished. It follows that it is immaterial because it is permanent. The reason is unestablished. It follows that it is permanent as posited in the text. The reason is unestablished. The text posits that it follows it is permanent because some existents are immaterial. I accept it. We are making a film about Drime Kunden. We heard that the monastery also hosts Drime Kunden and we came to see. Right, right. The monastery does host Drime Kunden. These days some of the monks are out doing errands for the monastery. We are missing actors. That is too bad. I have a VCD of our Drime Kunden performance. There is nothing to play it on. That is not a problem. Go and bring the laptop. Go to the shrine room and bring the VCD. How many actors are in the monastery? About twenty or thirty. A lot. Just the monks act? Of course. Roles like Mande Zangmo for example are they all played by monks? Yes. This is the first time I hear that. Now these are cattle. Girl! Your herd is daring. They will not budge how much I blast the horn. They did not use to be like this. Before they would snort and run off. Nowadays the car’s horn will startle people but these act like they are deaf. That’s how it is nowadays. Girl. What is the way to Nalung? Follow this road and you will be there in half an hour. Thank you. What are you going to Nalung for? They are making a movie about Drime Kunden. Nalung is playing Drime Kunden, and we are going to watch. Will the movie be shown after it is done? It will be. I will come to see it. I really like the story of Drime Kunden. That is it. I am going now. Oh, what is your name? What about it? I just want to know. Can’t you tell me? I will tell you when we meet again. Good then. I am off now. Hey. By the way you were talking it seemed like you are the director. Businessman, it is time to tell your love story. How far did I get yesterday? You told us a bit from before you met the girl. You did not really get to the point. I really forgot where I left off. From where you took the letter and went to look for the girl. You are the clear headed one, again. Go one and continue. A few days later, this was the next, next evening. She came running in. She felt unhappy. „I will get a bad grade. I will not pass,” she said. It is fine, regardless you pass or not. It does not matter. I will marry you for certain. Once she heard that, the poor girl, her tears just started flowing. „Will you really marry me?” „I gave you my word a long time ago”. Then she had nothing else to say. I embraced her, holding her close for a long time. That story really moved me. We stayed together for two, three days. I gave her some money and saw her to the bus station. There, I told her „Go home and regain your spirit”. „I will go, make a lot of money and return”. „If you pass, I will pay your tuition”. „If you do not, I will take you as my wife”. She gave me a kiss among all those people. „You are so good to me”. I watched the bus as it pulled away. My heart just dropped to the ground. When I went back in the room, it felt empty, as if I lost something. I stayed inside and did not once go out. I did not want to see anyone. Harvesting just as winter starts? They are harvesting straw. They harvest it as soon as it grows. It might snow heavily, so they are storing it for the cattle. That is hard. They need it for when the cattle give birth. That is what one must do. And then? I had to find a way to make money. I awoke the next day did not think I had what it takes. Such was my karma. Then I thought, and thought. I remembered this flimsy camera from when I went to collect donations. I borrowed a camera from a friend and went to Qinghai Lake to take pictures. When you tell it, try to mention only what is relevant. Yes. I used to have a photo of her. She gave it to me the day she left. She looked good in the picture. The photo was also done well. I went to take pictures and showed it around. „This photo was taken by me”, I would tell them. Then they thought I was a really great photographer. Saying it like this here makes me a little uncomfortable. You sure know how to publicize. I would go around with the photograph in my hand. Besides that, I also took the letter she sent me. When I missed her I would look at the photograph, read the letter. It was like that. Once I had ten films to develop, I would go to Xining. Every time I had to take it well. In Xining it was the same. I would be stingy with money. I would not eat meat. Just noodles all the time. How did you know photography? I knew nothing. It came just by taking photos over and over. Not only did I not know anything, I also had no capital to do business. As a last measure, I tried to take photos. Many people would ask „Why are you so set on making money?” I told them how I loved her, about our love, that I would marry her. Without money, one cannot take a wife, like a beggar. When I told the reason many among the girls would be so moved they would cry. You could only move the girls? Not at all. Many of the boys were also moved. They would say to me, ”You are so good to that girl”. „I have loved before but never cared as much for a girl”. „You are something special”, they said. I went everywhere, always trying to make money. I had enough to marry her. In the end, like the saying goes „Just as the Seven-rebirth pills arrive, the brother’s life has extinguished”. Did she change in the end? Just let me speak. I ran all over to gather enough money. I put aside about three thousand yuan. Back then three thousand was something. Then I went to the prefecture seat. There was a letter from her. It took about two months for me to receive the letter. In the letter it said that she went home. „I did not pass the graduation exam”. „I have decided now”. „If you have not forgotten me, come to my home”. „I will be waiting for you”. I used to have a medic friend who practiced Tibetan medicine. He had money. I used to always tell him about our love, how much I cared. Eventually, he told me, ”If you marry her, I will help you”. He loaned me his jeep, had his driver drive it and we set off. When we arrived in her village there was a small store. We went into the store and bought tea and khatak scarves. Also some small gifts. The salesperson was a girl. One who married into the village. „What are you buying so many things for?”, she asked. I could not hold back, „I am going to propose to Kalsang Tso”. Oh, I forgot to tell you the girl’s name is Kalsang Tso. The saleswoman took a good look at me, started to smile, and then laughed. „Aren’t you the monk who returned to laity?” How did she know that? I was dumbstruck. I just agreed. „About Kalsang Tso and I”, I said, ”How did you know?” „Surely I know. I am her friend”. „Kalsang Tso then?” She took another good look at me. „You still do not know? She has gotten married”. When I heard that it was as if I was hit by lighting. I was stunned. Driver, pull up here. That is not it. It is the wrong road. Back up. I will ask this child for directions. Boy! What is the way to Akhu Lusham Gya’s house? He is not home. He is at the Mani temple. Which is the way to the Mani temple? It is this way. Will you take us? Yes. Get inside. What is he doing in the Mani temple? The old people are chanting. Yes. What grade are you? Fifth grade. Good. Can you read? I can. What is your name? Pema Dorje. Your age? Eleven. Yes, yes. Eleven. Do good in school. Who is your father? Apa Chakhtar Sham. Oh, Apa Chakhtar Sham. Yes, yes. Akhu Lusham Gya is in here. - Akhu Lusham Gya. - We wish to talk to you. Let’s go to my house. You take my place. Sit over here. This is an award the local government presented to us. From 2003. We offered a performance while the Tenth Panchen Rinpoche visited Rekong. I was young back then. Here I played Drime Kunden. Panchen Rinpoche is here on the right? Yes. Oh, you were really young. I was small then. I am now too old and cannot act anymore. I also cannot just sit around. I instruct the young ones and help them. I do what I can to keep it going. Good, good. So many achievement awards. You have made a significant contribution to cultural preservation. You also strive to promote culture by making this film. Our Theater Association will do everything it can to assist you. Thank you. That is most kind of you. Now let’s see the act where Drime Kunden gives away his three children. Yes. The children are now in the school. Is the school close by? It is, just in the vicinity. Let’s go visit the school then. Sure. We troubled you. Bride! If the children come put up the background. Have them get dressed and be ready. Yes. This is the school. Shawo Dondrub, come. Call over Shawo Bhum, Tenzin Drolma, Gangla, and the others. Hurry. #Mother is calling #Mother is calling Hello. So cold! Cold. It is cold all of a sudden. Children have no worry, they play all day. A lot of children. More than a hundred children. The children are here. Come ! The children are here. These are the children. Do you know any songs? Yes. Sing a song you all know. Which song? Let’s sing „We are all children of kind parents”. You are known as youthful Dondrub I am known as girl Drolma The place we gather is our school Your character is virtuous My heart is sincere We are all children of kind parents Listen well to what your father says I finish anything mother asks We are the descendants of noble parents Strive to be hard working I shall stay dedicated We are all children of kind parents This is really a „Theater Village”. All the children are singers. These children can perform anything. They bring the old ones to tears. These three children will act in the movie. We need to see the act where King Drime Kunden offers his children. Good. These children’s acting bring life to the play. Let’s go and give it a try. King Drime Kunden. You are reputed for offering to charity everything you own. We came requesting alms. Look at us. Just barely surviving, hungry and in tatters, show us a sign of compassion. I am pleased you have come. Although I wish to fulfill your request I now have nothing left to give. Make us an offering of your three children. These three children are young. Woeful for them to leave their parents. Fear not for we are not murderers. We request them as servants. I have taken an oath to give whatever is asked of me. I must consent lest I break my vow. If I agree, their mother shall be unable to bear her sorrow. What will I do? King, you are not keeping your sworn vow. We regarded you as a real bodhisattva. My three children, Lakden, Lakhual, and Lakzima The end of this long-lasting sojourn is today This pulling apart after living harmoniously Is the mark of impermanent karmic accumulations In order to accomplish our father’s the King’s great objective Us, brothers and sisters agree to go along At Father’s behest, I shall go Such kind and compassionate mother it gives me great distress to forsake I grieve in vain, farewell my parents Father has vowed… Father… Father has vowed to fulfill all requests So that he may realize I have the words wrong. I will sing again. Lakzima continue. At Father’s behest, I also shall go This mother that raised me and offered her milk Not meeting her again… At Father’s behest, I also shall go This mother that raised me and offered her milk Not meeting her again brings me great sorrow Would this life not reunite us I pray the next will My three children are like my own heart Though I suffer from parting with my heart And hence these alms are for the dharma I stand courageous and do not shed tears Merciful Lama, deities, and Precious Jewels On the path these children are taking Quickly dispel impediments from illness Looking at the children wearing these clothes makes me laugh. Have you given out three children away to charity? I gave them away to the three Brahmins. Zangmo, do not! Do not! Our exquisite children, like the sun Quickly veiled in the shroud of the Brahmin’s clouds Have vanished like gale ravaging through my fruits Zangmo, heed well my words Do you not recall what I have told you? While undergoing practice in the land of Bede Is this not what I said to you? The previous life… I forget now. Let them continue. Of course. I joyfully make this offering Otherwise, even my wife, children And own life, would I pledge these? Do not disturb this act of charity Attend my cultivation of enlightenment I have come taking such an oath Yet now you cause me such distress Having journeyed many mountains and valleys You are but my only dear companion Your grieving disquiets me The young man acts really well. Right. A bit humorous, but it moved me. It almost brought me to tears. Would he be able to play Drime Kunden in the movie? This actor is very different from the role of Drime Kunden. As a first impression he seems kind and well-intentioned. I do not think he would be right for that role. And the Mando Zangme actress? Girl, you have also played Mande Zangmo. What do you think of her acting? Her acting is good, but she does not have the voice. Enough now. Let’s not talk behind their back. Businessman, would you tell your love story? Your love story is intriguing. Right. I will tell it now. The third day my doctor friend came for me. Once he saw me, he scolded me to no end. However much he blamed me, I was oblivious. So I went back to Xining. I stayed in a hotel. That is how I was, just like a fool. Then, with no recourse, he told me to go to the hospital. I went and stayed at the Provincial People’s Hospital. You went to the hospital? Of course. No one would believe me. There was nothing wrong with me. I just simply collapsed. Once I left the hospital he would bring over attractive girls to talk to. I would flare up just hearing them speak. I only thought about her. Just could not forget her. He said to me „You can go to the hospital but it will not help your illness”. You should go somewhere and keep yourself busy. I listened to him and set off. I went to Lanzhou. Why? Because his root Lama was residing there. In Lanzhou. He took me to the Alak. I also knew the Alak. I had once brought a tsa tsa mold for him. The Alak also remembered me. I retold everything clearly to the Alak. The Alak considered the situation carefully. „Your situation will slowly improve. You will recover”. „Your life is not in danger”. „It is best if you do not look for her”. „Even if you meet her, she will not come with you”. What did you and the Alak talk about? What could I say? I just told it like it was. He also said for me to preoccupy myself. The two of us went to Chengdu. There I saw a Chinese woman that looked just like her. I lost it once I saw her. Could not help missing her. „I will go find her whatever it takes”. „Otherwise I will never find peace inside”. I was so stupid back then. If I went and found her, I thought she would come back. That I was the only for her. „If she is happy there, then let her be”. „If she still has not forgotten me, I will take her back”. Once I decided, I went back. Again, he took me to see the Alak. I told him everything. The Alak listened and then laughed. „If you really must go and meet her,” „then go ahead”. „Do not take more than seven days”. „If you meet her within this time,” „you will resolve this matter”. So it was that I went to look for her. I asked around and located her. „She is circumambulating the Sakar Stupa,” I was told. Circumambulating the Sakar Stupa was customary in that area. Women would do so when they became pregnant. It benefits the birth. On the seventh day I met a girl that was working as a waitress near the bus station. Talking to her, I found out that she was nearby. Then I found out that was not her, she made a mistake. Then we went on talking. When I said „Kalsang Tso,” she knew who it was. ”Kalsang Tso is not here. We are classmates”. As we were talking a young man wearing a hat came riding a bicycle. „Oh, that one”. „He is the one she married. An elementary teacher”. „His name is Dorje Gyal”. I looked on as he went into the school. I just waited there. At noon, school let out and he went home to eat. I followed him and found the house. I waited at an intersection. In the afternoon, as soon as he left for school, I went right inside. You went straight inside? Yes. I went inside, and there was an old man sitting in the sun. That was the man’s father. He was blind. „We have guests!” „Good, good. Come inside”. I told them that I was from Chentsa. „From the bride’s side? Good, good”. „You go up”. „Bride Kalsang Tso is there”. Hearing him refer to her as ‘Bride Kalsang Tso’ just burned me inside. I opened the door and she was coming from the other side. We ran into each other. We just stood looking at each other, speechless. We just sat there. I slapped her on the shoulder, and we went inside. She then told me to sit down. „Let me pour tea”. „No need,” I said. „I am not here for tea”. She took some fruits and peeled one for me. „I do not want fruit”. „You do not need to bring me food”. „How did you find me?” she asked. „I have no idea how I found you”. „My affection and my feelings for you is like this”. „I myself do not know how I found you, but here I am”. Then we talked. „Do you like it here?” „I like it here”. Then I said „When the two of us first met here” Umm, no. I did not mean here. „In Labrang, when we went to pay respects in Labrang,” „you told me in front of the Gunthang Stupa” ‘The Gunthang Stupa is very beautiful’. ‘You think so?’ ‘If the Gunthang Stupa was alive’ ‘you would still be the more beautiful’. „Did you not tell me that?” „These seven, eight months I have been true to you”. Her tears ran down as I told her this. She stood there open-eyed, tears running, stifling her feelings. Not even blinking? Not even blinking. She let them dry on her face. „Do not do this in front of me”. „I did not let you go. You let me go”. „You are haughty and shameless”. Near the end of our talk, afternoon came. „You have really changed”. „What is it? I do not look good now?” „Actually, even more beautiful”. „Your feelings have changed”. I got up then and holding her head I said, „Take a good look at me”. „I am the Dobe from before, I have not changed”. „It is you who changed”. She then let her feelings go. She did not until then? She did not. She controlled herself. What do you think is the reason you cared so much for her? You barely spent any time together. I had not been with a girl before. She was the first girl that I met. Also, her promise the first time we met, „Even if we are homeless, you will be the only one for me”. That is the reason. We reached the prefecture seat. Just ahead is where she lives. I will show you. Good. I also want to see that. This is the house when the girl went to after she married. Let’s go now. Let’s go. You stay here, I am going to ask around. We forgot to ask you. Girl, what is the name of the young man we are looking for? Kathub Tashi. Where is Teacher Kathub Tashi? Is that the new teacher? Yes. Oh, his office is at the end of the third floor. Thank you. Let’s go in now. You go ahead, I will wait here. Just tell him to come outside. That is fine. Which one is Kathub Tashi? He is. I am Kathub Tashi. We are making a film and have come searching for an actor. Is that you? I have been told about it. Words travels fast. Yes, I have been told. Sit, sit. We heard that you acted in a television series. I was really small, I just really liked to act. What did you perform on television. I played in the movie, „Alak Tsigu”. I played the young Alak Tsigu. Yes. How old were you there? I was about twelve or thirteen. What else have you played in? Oh, in college I played in a movie, „Mountain Regiment”. I played an infantry man. I fell in love with a woman named Drolma. Drolma did not love me. She would always stay out, and I never knew where. One day I found her, but I did not get the role right. The director scolded me in front of many people. „If a college student cannot act something so easy,” „what can you act?” „Your mother took you to school,” „your teachers looked out for you”. „You cannot even act this role”. I was embarrassed and became angry. I turned towards the director „That is just fine”. „You have Tibetan machismo written all over your forehead”. He then let me act in my way. Like that. Yes. You have also played namthar. I have acted since I was small. Could you sing an act? Sure. Which act do you prefer? Drime Kunden offering his eyes to the three Brahmins? This is the song Drime Kunden sings as he offers his eyes. Heed well, excellent Brahmin I nobly grant you my two eyes Your wish fulfilled, gaze onto the three worlds Through the silk fabric of the faultless dharma Let me become a torch that dispels the murk of ignorance May this be the last of my offerings Should I sing another? You sang really well. No need to sing again. Are you planning to return home this Losar? I do not think I will go this year. Why is that? No special reason. If you will not perform, they will have a difficult time. They will find someone else. With this government job now I cannot go home every year. We have just paid a visit to your village. The girl who plays Mande Zangmo in your village is here with us now. Where is she? She is here in the school’s courtyard. Hello. Yes. Is the kid well? Yes, give him the phone. He will not take it. He is doing homework. He won’t take it. Do not let him miss school. Make sure he does his homework. Wasn’t he sick the other day? Better now. Take him to get a shot. What? Yes. Make sure he dresses warmly. I also want to return quickly. Not right away, though. Yes. Bye. Isn’t that Kathub Tashi? Is it? Yes. He is carrying that girl’s scarf. Driver, honk the horn. Slow down. Stop over here. Demo. Is that you? Is that the girl’s scarf in your hand? Yes. I gave this to her last year. She climbed in the bus opened the window and threw it to me. She says that she has no more need for it. An upstanding girl. We talked about me returning home this year to play in Drime Kunden along with her. Oh, good. It is good to go home. She said how she was moved by the businessman’s love story. Did she say that? Yes. She said that at the bus station. Must really be a moving story. It is. It is my own love story. I have not been able to see what she looks like. As the bus pulled away, I felt empty inside. Here it is. The chairman gave me a photograph of all of you together. Which one is she? This is the village theater troupe. But that day she went somewhere. She is not in the photograph. It is this hard to see a beautiful woman’s face. Your love story is really good. I wish to make it into a movie. The director also told them he will make a movie about them. Do not believe him. Who can make so many movies? It was not empty talk. I really meant it. This is it. Goodbye for now. Now, let’s go. What about this young man for your movie? As Drime Kunden? Yes. I think he would be really good. We came all this way here. I gave it a lot of thought. Now I do not feel sure about the role of Drime Kunden. I do not even know what kind of person should play this role. Subtitles ripped by Peterlin
