Let's go, Cowboy. You two have just been sitting there. -Come on, Christy. -Okay. Darryl, no trouble, okay? It's okay. Keep the party going. -I'll be right back. -Okay. Hey, baby. How you doing? Hi, baby. Want some? Here. How about playing this one here? It's your favorite. Sure, Darryl. -Hey, where you going? -Let me go. Hey, man, I just wanna, like, you know, I just wanna dance with you, baby. -No. -Hey, wait a second, come here. She's my old lady, man. Hey, man. All you gotta do is say she's taken, man. You don't have to get physical with me, you know what I mean? I don't want you to touch her again. This cat is obviously suicidal, man. You got that? Let's just split, man. See you later, baby. [MOUTHING] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINES REVVING] -Darryl, I want to talk to you, okay? -Talk. Not here. Let's go someplace else. But, Chris, this party's for you. Please? Hey, look who went by. Let's split! I just want something better than being a Stomper's girl. Oh, Darryl, I still love you. Honest, I do. It's just that I need a man I can depend upon, and not someone who's irresponsible and runs around with overaged delinquents. But, Chris, you don't understand. They're my friends. They're like family. Some family. And they've got something more. They can go where they want, they can do what they want, they don't have to answer to anyone for anything. No nine-to-fives, no hassles, no hang-ups. They're free. They've got a bike, a blanket and the world. Darryl, what's it gonna take for you to see what you're doing with your life? Chris, see it my way. [CHRIS SIGHS] [MOTORCYCLES APPROACHING] You slimy creep. [LAUGHS TRIUMPHANTLY] You mother-lover. Slimy creep. Hey, you wanna come, honey? Gonna rub your face in the dirt. [BOTH GRUNTING] Hey, come on, Cowboy, huh? Come on. Don't, okay, don't look. Darryl! Darryl! Wow! Look at his face. Magoo, you snuffed him. [SCREAMS] Cool, man, you... Darryl! [SOBBING] Prez! Prez, what are we gonna do? What about the chick? -She can bring the heat down on us. -We can't leave her. -We're gonna take her with us, man. -We what? We're gonna take her with us. But that's kidnapping, man, that's a death game. Yeah, well, so's a murder, man. -Then this one won't matter. -Oh, Joanne, come on! Hey, could you put the knife away? What are you, knife-happy or something? -Take her to Big M. -Big M? Mexico? -Five hundred miles. -Yeah, well, just cool it a minute. Might as well... Might as well make some money off the broad. Why waste her? What happens if somebody comes looking for her? Who's gonna come looking for her, man? He's the only one that saw us, right? -He's gonna do any talking? -He's right, man. -I say we take them. -Yeah, come on, let's get... Get his bike in the bushes, man, and get his body in the bushes, and let's get out of here. We'll be out of the state before anybody knows about it. That's enough. Hey, baby. Hey, listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Just leave me alone. Hey, look, honey. Listen. We're gonna get a doctor to help your old man, all right? You killed him. You killed him! Okay, listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. All right, he's dead, right? Well, you're gonna be dead, too, if you don't do what I tell you. You understand that? Now get up! [SHRIEKS] We're gonna take you for a little ride, you get it? And if you're real good, we're gonna let you go after a while. Magoo! Magoo, here, take this, man. If the chick tries anything, man, just waste her, that's all, just waste her. You're gonna ride with me. Go on, ride with Magoo. Go on. Get on. You'd better hold on. I said you'd better hold on. [GROANING] Chris! Chris! [INAUDIBLE] Here, Prez. -Yeah, man. -Hey, Magoo. [LAUGHS] Ah! The grapes of wrath, man. Man, that Stomper sure had fine taste. Yeah, man. His old lady is really uptown stuff, man. -Right, Bones? -Hey, how do you know she ain't a mama? Man, you ever seen a mama look like that? Mouth's right, man. That chick's got too much class to be a mama. I've seen a lot of mamas with class, man. Not a Stomper's chick, man. What do you say, Clean Cut? What do I say? I say we never should have taken her. It was just a manslaughter beef till we grabbed her, now it's a death rap. Hey, the man's probably crawling all over right now. Hey, cool it, man. Like, the Stomper's wasted. Nobody's gonna find his body, man. No heat knows about her. Everything's fine, man. They ain't gonna find out, either. Just cool the rapping, man. Look, honey, I know how you feel. I mean, I'd feel the same way if something happened to my Chino. -So you'll get over him. -Just leave me alone. I was just trying to help. -How you two getting on? -Okay. You getting along? Hey, baby. Don't take it so hard. You know, the world's full of good men. There're some good men in this camp right here. Chino! Hey, baby, let's try a little smile, huh? -What are you trying to pull, Chino? -Hey, what is it with you? I'm just trying to be friendly. Wow! Chino. Look, you're my man. Leave her alone, okay? Joanie, flake off! -Oh, you son of a... -Flake off! Help! You know something? You ever do that again, I'm just gonna turn you out, baby. You're just gonna be turned out. Chino, wait. Chino, I love you. Chino, wait, I love you. Please... Hey, man. The chick split! -You dumb broad. -Chino, I'm sorry. Oh, no! Come on. -Where'd she go? -Man, she's gone. Well, just spread out, man. We gotta find her before night or we've had it. Ahh! Chino! Ohh! [SCREAMING] Magoo! Magoo. Hey, let up, man. Hey! That's enough, man. Let her up. I said that's enough! [SCREAMING] All right, you cats, just tune in to me, man. See this little doll here, man, you see her? This ain't no mama, man. This ain't no mama. I want you cats just to steer clear of her. If any of you dudes want a hassle, man, just turn it on. Just turn it on. Okay, get this stud up. All right. Come on, baby. Come on, champ. [MAGOO GRUNTING] Come on, Magoo. Hey, man. You guys seen any Black Souls? Them, those, huh? Oh, yeah. Right, man. We passed them about an hour ago. About 10 miles back the road. In fact, they turned off onto a trail leading into Managua Canyon. CHINO: Hey, baby, you know, you're gonna waste away to nothing. You gotta get something in your stomach, huh? Even a body like yours needs vitamins. Now, come on, just a little bite. Hey, look. Look, I'm responsible for you, you hear that? Come on, you gotta eat something. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Hey, look at me. See, now watch this. Mmm. Mmm. That's really good. Come on, try some. Come on, baby. Please. Maybe she'd eat if you untied her. So who cares, man? Let her starve. Phew! I really need your help. Come here. That wouldn't be right, letting you starve. Come here, I wanna show you something. Look, isn't it funny? [LAUGHING] Come on. Look, look. Doesn't it feel good? Doesn't feel bad. [SIGHS] I'm gonna let you go. I ain't gonna let you go. I'm just gonna let you, you know, go. For a minute. Just hold your hands out. There you go, see? I'm not such a bad cat. Got you something to eat, man. Here, eat it yourself. Hey! Wow, man, you know something? You are really something. You are really something. [CHRIS GRUNTING] Ahh! [CHRIS SCREAMING] [CHINO BREATHING HEAVILY] Ahh! Mouth. Mouth! Come here and tie her up, man. [SIGHS] Hey. How you doing? [CHINO MOANING] Come here. Come here. -You okay? -Yeah. [CHUCKLES] Looks like you tangled with a bumblebee. I used to run with the Stompers. My name's Smiley Franks. Hey, I heard of you. You used to be vice president of San Berdo chapter, right? -True. -Glad to meet you. My name's Darryl Hudson. They call me Cowboy. -Who did you hassle with? -The Black Souls. The gang stomped me and took my girl. -When did this happen? -Yesterday afternoon. -How many were there? -Five. -Has your girl got long blonde hair? -Yeah, that's Chris. And there's a little black-haired chick riding with them? -Where'd you see 'em? -About sundown yesterday. They turned off a canyon about 15 miles back. I covered that canyon last night. I didn't see any sign of them. It only runs in about a mile. They're probably back in the woods off the road. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Morning. Here. I thought you might like some. Hey, really... I'm really sorry for everything. Here. -What's your name? -Does it really matter? I'm sorry. It's Christy. Paul. But, well, the family kind of tagged me with Clean Cut. What are you doing with this bunch of animals? Chino's my brother. Yeah, see, there's just him and me and, well... -Do you think he'll let me go? -Sure, he'll... -Yeah, he'll let you go. -When? [MOTORCYCLE APPROACHING] -CHINO: Hey! -I'll find out, okay? Guess who I just talked to on the phone, man. Big M. -Hey, groovy, man. -Yeah, it's all set. We're gonna make the drop of the chick tomorrow at the ghost town. -What ghost town? -Well, it's right outside Rosarito, man. Hey, man, how about the bread? No, it's not Rosarito, it's Puerto Rosarito. -The bread, man. -Oh, we've got the bread, man. Jeez. Ain't we taking a chance keeping her with us that long? JOANNE: Yeah, Prez, let's just waste her here and now. You know something, baby? You've really got some corny ideas. Okay. So Big M gets busted and she's found, right? She ain't gonna be there that long, baby. By tomorrow night, she's gonna be halfway to South America. And when she gets there, she ain't gonna be talking to nobody. MOUTH: How do you mean? CHINO: They get her hooked on hard stuff, man. When she's hooked, like, she's ready to play ball with those toreoses. Hey, ole. Okay, what'll we do till tomorrow? We're gonna do what we've always planned to do. We're going to the love-in at Dome. What about the Stompers, Chino? We're gonna keep her out of sight, baby. Right? Right, huh? Besides, the only Stomper we ever seen, man, is dead. -Black Flag. -Black Flag got him. Okay, let's get packed, man, and split. Here's the situation, baby. Look, we accidentally snuffed out your old man. And the only way out for me and my people is to either snuff you out or to sell you to some high-class Mexicans across the border. Now, being good people, we decided to sell you to these high-class Mexican friends of ours. But until that moment comes, baby, if you hassle us anymore, you're dead. Now, you take your choice. You either play along with the Mexicans, take your chances with them, or I can just put you out of your misery right now, baby. Now, you take your choice. All right. Hey, that's good. Just play it cool, just play it cool. All right? Hey, Clean Cut, come here, man. Untie her ankles. Let's split out of this place. Hey, look, everything's gonna be all right. Just do what he says. Darryl, the fire's still warm. We couldn't have missed them by much. Hey, Smiley, over here. They've probably headed west. How the hell did we miss them? They probably picked up an old farm road a couple of miles down. It isn't used much now that the freeway's in. You think they could have turned her loose? Can't tell. Looks like they headed south. There's a big run at Dome. If I was them, I wouldn't go anywhere near it. But I got a sneaking suspicion that's exactly where they'll be. -How far? -Two hundred. [ENGINE FALTERING] What's your trouble? I don't know. It's not the carburetor, the bowl's full. I'll check it out. I heard you had real class when you rode with the Stompers. Yeah, you might say that. Well, how come you split from the family, man? You finally start asking yourself what the hell's really going on. And then you start thinking that maybe being a citizen isn't all that bad. -You get what I mean? -Partly. Darryl, Stompers are losers. I just got tired of being a loser. You know, someday you're gonna be faced with the same problem. You're gonna spend the rest of your life running with a wolf pack or retire your colors and try for something better. Funny, somebody else said that to me. Not too long ago. Well, there's the trouble. It was that damn little wire all the time. -You got an answer? -Shoot. When we find this girl of yours... Two of us, five of them. -Any Stompers on this run? -No, man. Wasn't on our schedule. Mind getting your head busted again? Look, if you don't want to come, you're free to split. Nobody said anything about not coming. I just wondered if she's worth it. She's worth it. [FIRECRACKERS BURSTING] [GIRLS SHRIEKING] [HORN HONKING] [POP MUSIC PLAYING] [INDISTINCT] I propose a toast. To Pony and his boss old lady. Man, you had to see their faces as they come running out of the preacher's house and we just jumped on my chopper and do the bird. [ALL LAUGH] That's beautiful, Pony, beautiful. May you have many righteous Stompers. -Here, here! -Here, here! Hey, man, let's split. All kinds of strange broads just waiting to see me. She's wrapped up for the night now, so... Are we gonna make the scene now? Yeah, we are, baby. We are, but you're not. You're gonna stay here. -What? -That's right. Look, Chino, why me? -I mean, come on, I wanna go with you. -Why you... Look, I said no, man, that's it. Just no, that's it. -No, man. -All right. Okay, I'll watch her. I'll watch her real good, Chino. She's gonna be in great shape when you get back. Okay. Say, come with us, man. Just come with us, man. Just come with us. Clean Cut, come here, man. Just get lost, will you? Wow. Do you know something? You're the only one around here with any smarts besides me, baby. It's weird. Look, man, I want you to guard that slut. You know what we done back there, man, is murder, baby... Like, she's the only witness. So I want you to watch her until we come back from partying, all right? I'll make it up to you next weekend. All right? How are you, brother? Just keep her tied up, man, and don't go messing with her. -You got that? -Yeah, I got it, Chino. MAN: Hey, take it off. Come on, baby, take it off. Take it off. -MAN: Come on, baby. -Take it off. Take it off. Come on, take it off. Hey, baby! Let's see your breasts! Take it off. Come on, all the way. Come on, all the way, man. Come on, all the way. Come on, take it off. [GIRL SHRIEKING] MAN: Come on, go, go! Hey, man. Hey, Bones. See that, Prez? Come on, Bones. We got some work to do, man. [SHRIEKING] I'm sorry I can't untie you. Orders from Chino. You're afraid of him, aren't you? No! I'm not afraid of anybody. Then why don't you untie me? I just can't, that's all. Now, do you want this coffee or not? Do you like me? Yeah. I like you. You know, you're really very good-looking. You're kind of way out yourself. Do you have a girl? No. Have you ever been in love? Yeah. Once. What happened? Being tied up like this really cramps my shoulders. [MOANING] That feels good. Do you think you could ever love again? I guess so. Do you think you could love someone like me? No, Paul, don't. Please don't be like the others. I'm sorry. I thought you liked me. -I do. But... -But not enough, huh? You know I could take you. Yes, you could. But wouldn't it be better if I was willing? Yeah. What about that Stomper we wasted back there? That was over a long time ago. He was just visiting me and trying to make a go of it again. But I turned him off. Prove it. [LOUD MUSIC PLAYING] Brush? [INDISTINCT TALKING] Hey, slut. [ALL CHEERING] [LAUGHING] Doreen! Doreen, stop playing games. This is Pony. Doreen! Doreen! Doreen, you come out of there, now! Come on in. The water's beautiful. Okay, lady. If that's the way you want it, that's the way you'll get it. [SOBBING] Mama. Mama. Mama! -Hi. -Flake off, gruesome. Hey, adorable. Maybe you'd make out better if she was tied up. Funny. You guys are really funny. Wait a minute. You can't do that to my pal. -Kill him. -I'll kill you. I'll kill you. I'll... [SCREAMING] Help! I'm drowning. -I can't swim. I can't swim. -You'll have to learn! Somebody help me out, just somebody, I can't swim. -What's happening, man? -He's goofing out on acid, baby. Look at that. He thinks the whole Pacific Ocean's on top of him. Somebody spit on his head and he thinks he's drowning. I could really go for you. More than just this. I feel the same way. Untie me so I can make love right. -Can I trust you? -What do you think? [GIRL SCREAMING] We was just asking, man. [SPITS] Will you observe the withers on that little palomini? -Wait a minute, man. The what? -The palomini. -The withers? You mean palomino, man. -Palomini. -You talking about a horse? -[LAUGHS] Let's mount up. Hey, man, how would you like to make some real bread? -I got nothing against money. -Lay it on him. We'll take your mama down to Mexico, man, and sell her, and we'll all make a lot of money. She's my old lady. Doesn't matter. They dig groovy blondes. Hey, man. Hey, it doesn't matter if she's your old lady or not. You know why? Because you can get $1,000 for her, and you just go out and buy yourself another old lady, man. I said she's my old lady. We've already got us one blonde. And she's a mother now. A mother. You know we're gonna make a lot of money from her, Bones. She is out of sight. We got her from a Stomper. You're a liar. Wait a minute, man. No, he's not kidding you. At first he didn't understand. But you know something, he don't understand nothing now, man. Nothing. 'Cause we messed up his mind, man. Kind of scrambled his brains a little. You two guys did in a Stomper, huh? That way we didn't have to split it with him. But with you, we're just gonna kind of cut it right down the middle. You wanna take my old lady down to Mexico and sell her to a rich matador. -What did you do that for? -'Cause I'm a Stomper, too, man. [GIRLS SCREAMING] [CROWD CLAMORING] [SIRENS WAILING] [GUNSHOT] -Hey, man! -Hey, looks like Bones! -Hey, the man's here, the man's here! -Cops! Hey, man, we gotta split, man. Come on, the man's here. Come on. [CANS CLANGING] [GUNSHOT] MAN 1: Cops, man. MAN 2: Cops! Hey, cops! MAN 1: The fuzz is here, man! Hey! Hey, man, you're cheating. I seen you. But that's all right. As long as you share her, old big brother Chino will never know nothing. Nothing's happening. Now go on back to the party, Magoo. Don't be that way, pretty-boy. You know you were just warming her up for old Magoo, here. I'm warning you, Magoo. Get out of the way, punk. Me and this chickie here will show you how it's done. You come any closer and I'll waste you, Magoo. I mean it, man. [SCREAMING] CHINO: Hold it! Cut it, man. Cut it! I ought to snuff both of you, man. -Chino, I... -Shut up, man. Get on your choppers. This place is crawling with heat. Come on. You'll get on the back of Clean Cut's bike. Come on! [MOTORCYCLES APPROACHING] Darryl! Over here. Come on. I know them. -Pony, get up. -Hey, don't shake me, man. Doreen. Pony. Hey. What are you doing here, man? The party's over. Hey, you missed one hell of a good fight. Did either of you see Chris? Chris? Why, no. Your ex-old lady? No, man. But what do you think of this? Come on, Pony. This is important. So is this, man. We made it legal. Congratulations. Did you see any Black Souls? -Yeah, I saw a couple. -Why? They gang-stomped me and hijacked Chris. -When? -Yesterday afternoon. That's right. They said they had a blonde they'd taken from a Stomper. They were going to sell her to some rich Mexican across the border. So that was Chris they were talking about. Where in Mexico? I can't remember it. -Think, Pony. Think. -It was Puerto something. -Rosarito? -That's it. It was Puerto Rosarito. They were gonna take her and sell her to some broad pusher outside of Puerto Rosarito. -How far is that? -About 350 miles south of here. How long a head start they got on us? -At least four hours. -Thanks. Hey, D. Wait up! I'm going with you. There's your road. Well, they're down there somewhere with at least two hours on us. From the looks of this road, it's gonna take us that long just to get down there. There's an old hunter's trail, washed out in spots, but most of it's pretty good. Come on. Let's make it. CHINO: I want you guys to take her over there and tie her up. Joanne, get on the back of Bones' bike. Go on. Magoo! Magoo, I want you to keep watch down there. Take her over there and tie her up. Go on. I'm gonna be out there. -Hi. -Hi, baby. I thought I told you to stay down there and guard the chick. They don't need me, Chino. She's tied up. -So am I. -Are you? Hey, baby, come on. I just wanted to get loaded, man, please. -You know, I'm tired. -Later, man. Later. Get loaded later, what does that mean? Please, Chino. Please. You're a good chick. Come here. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on, baby. [LAUGHS] Make a sound, baby, and I'll snuff you. [MAGOO BREATHING HEAVILY] Magoo! [GROANING] [CHUCKLES] [ENGINE STARTS] [REVVING] [SCREAMS] -CHINO: Magoo! -Chino! [GUNSHOT] [SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY] [SOBBING] Hey. Hey, it's me. Remember? I'm sorry. Hey, don't... CHINO: They ain't gonna catch you. I'm gonna take care of you, man. They ain't gonna get you, man. See what's... Easy. -Clean Cut. -Hey, you guys, goddamn. Hurry up, man. Grab him. Grab him. Shh! Clean Cut, man. Man! Clean Cut! Prez, wait a minute, man. He's dead. He's dead, man. He's dead. Now, just cool it. Come on, let's get him out of here. [MOTORCYCLES APPROACHING] Chino! Bones, what's that? Go see what it is, man, there's something back there. Man, he's dead. -No! -Stompers! Come on, get out of here. -Come on, man. Come on! -No. No! No! -Come on... -Come on. He's dead! Come on, Chino! The Stompers are coming. [GRUNTS] Chino! No! Chino! [SOBBING] Chino. No. [MUSIC PLAYING]
