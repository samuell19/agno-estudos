[MUSIC PLAYING] FAITH MOORE: Leo, could you go in the office and check inside the drawer on the right-hand side? I left the candles. Yeah, I know. [CHUCKLES] Mm-hmm. Oh, one other thing, Leo. Could you pick up the champagne for me? Oh, great. You know Richard with his schedule, he'll space and forget. Hm? Um, yep, starts at 8:00 tonight. OK. Yeah, see you then. OK, bye! What? He's just left for Irvine? [SIGHS] Tricia, he knows we have dinner at 8:00, doesn't he? He went with Kit? [MUTTERS] Um, no. No, thanks anyway, Tricia. OK. Yeah. Bye. [SIGHS] Yum, chocolate cake! Yeah, well, you eat your dinner and you can lick the bowl. What is for dinner? Salmon. Don't worry, I got you chicken nuggets. It's on the table. Oh, by the way, I got you that swimsuit you wanted for Grandma's. I wish you and Dad were coming. When it's just me and Grandma she treats me like I'm three or something. Your grandma loves you. Dad hasn't gone to the beach even once this summer. Or thinks about anything but work. Now, come on, Daddy only wants what's best for us. If he wanted what's best for us he'd be home more. You're a smart kid. WALTER (ON TELEVISION): Veronica. Veronica, wake up. Come into the dining room. I've got a surprise for you. VERONICA LANGE (ON TELEVISION): I don't want a surprise, Walter. WALTER (ON TELEVISION): But, sweetheart, it's our five-month anniversary. Come on. I'm tired. I want to sleep. Where are the pills? WALTER (ON TELEVISION): It's always time for the pills. Come in to the dining room. Come see the beautiful flowers I got you. [CHEERING] And please forget your diet today. I'll run that extra mile tomorrow. I'll go get the coffee. Now big pieces. [INAUDIBLE] I could kill him. Every woman wants to kill a man at least once. Hell, I've wanted to kill at least a dozen. Damn him, he's known about this for weeks. Hey, it's no big deal. It's just my stupid birthday party. No, it's not just this, Willa. It's everything. The only time I get to speak to Richard these days is when I leave messages with his secretary. Come on, it's bound to let up. Not in the wonderful world of advertising. Three months ago it was antiperspirant, and now it is Campion Sporting Goods. It's not going to let up. You've got the meetings and the, um, conferences with Kit. With all the time they spend together, if I didn't know better I would-- I'd think they were married. [DOOR OPENS, PEOPLE CHATTING] Guess who finally came to dinner. RICHARD MOORE: Yeah, Faith tells me what a slave driver you are. Honey, I'm sorry. We had to meet with the production company about last second edit changes and I-- I know. You had to go to Irvine. Tricia told me. -Well-- So who wants coffee? MAN: I do, please. -Thank you, darling. -Yes, sweetheart. Nice to meet you. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Bye-bye. Nice to meet you. Bye now, honey. Faith, I'm sorry. OK? Michael Campion's infamous for being anal and changing his mind. He is driving my entire creative team crazy. You know crazy, Richard. Thursday you were meant to pick up the groceries and you forgot. Tuesday it was your turn to pick up Travis from the swim team, and you're a no-show tonight. We were hosting a dinner party, and it wasn't "we," Richard. It was me. -I know. You're right. I'm sorry. I don't want to be right. I want my husband back. OK, I'll tell you what. What do you say you and I have lunch tomorrow at Won Kai's? Just like old times? You me and some sweet and sour pork? What's the catch? Hey, please. Sum number three? Sum number three. All right. Then it's a date. Mm-hmm. Bed? No, I need to clear up first. See you in a bit. Have I? Yeah, right, Richard. Carson's Antiques. FAITH MOORE: Carson Antiques? Yes, 8 o'clock. OK, bye. WILLA MARTINEZ: So who's this Kit anyway? FAITH MOORE: Oh, she's the Account Manager. Bubbly, blonde, pretty aggressive. Do you think he's having an affair with her? Oh, I don't know what to think anymore. Well, in legal talk, this is hard evidence. Guess you two will have something to talk about over lunch. FAITH MOORE: I might just throw that sweet and sour pork right in his face. [WILLA CHUCKLES] Willa, I need to review the auction inventory with you. I can hardly wait to hear Richard's creative excuse. [BELL DINGS] English, around 1880, correct? Sorry, I didn't see you come in. Um, yes. I'm impressed. Is it being auctioned tonight? It is. And everything else that's marked. Oh, uh, could you excuse me? -Yeah. You ready for some number three? Mm. I'll let them know I'm leaving. [PHONE RINGS] Oh, no. You're not serious, Kit? Two hours? OK, look, do me a favor and ask Tricia to call me an airport shuttle, OK? Yeah, thanks. I'll see you there. Bad news. No Won Kai, right? Yeah, I just spoke to Kit. It seems that Michael Campion is in Las Vegas for some convention and he wants to review our campaign proposal with his executives. Look, just try to understand, OK? I should be back Monday. Then you'd better go, Richard, hadn't you? I hate this as much as you do. Just go. I'll call you from my hotel room. Yeah. [BELL DINGS] From your hotel room. The auction tonight, what time is it? Oh, I'm sorry. Uh, 8:00 o'clock. Are you all right? Oh, uh, yeah. Fine, thank you. -Oh. OK, then. I'll see you tonight. Great. [BELL DINGS] No, I was hurt this morning. Now I'm just angry. You've got to think of other things. Have a glass of wine, it will help. Besides, there's a lot of good-looking men in here. Oh, ha ha. Come on, I'm just joking. Good evening, ladies. Oh, hello again. Uh, Willa, this is-- -Walter York. It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you. Excuse me, I'd better help the boss man out. Catch you later. -OK. You know, the last auction I attended was in London? Really? Yes, I ended up getting this old leather chest that I had to drag back to my hotel in Hampstead. Thought I'd save a few pounds by taking the tube, ended up losing the damn thing on the northern line. I grew up in Hampstead. Ah, have you ever been to Jack Straw Castle? Well, of course I have! Snuck my first pint there when I was 15. All that city, all that history. Here they rip down anything that is not new and plastic. Yeah, well that's L.A. For you. No, that's all over the US. I used to live in Georgia, there was this old church they want to tear down to put up a tire store. A tire store. What happened? We fought it. And we renovated the church and now it's a historical landmark. Well, good for you! We're doing everything we can to save Bushman House, but it's people like you that make the difference. By the way, no one's come close to your bid on the clock. Oh, I'll do anything for a good cause. You don't take credit cards, huh? Can I bring you a check tomorrow? Yeah, sure. But it's Saturday, so we close at 4:00 o'clock. No problem. Around tea time. Tea time it is. Good night. -Good night. Tea for two. WALTER (ON TELEVISION): Come on, this is our big night. Stay up. Talk to me. Talk to you? Walter, that's all we ever do is talk. I don't want to talk anymore. I just want to be left alone. Alone, please. You never understood, Veronica. Faith will. She'll understand I'm the one. [MACHINE BEEPS] GRANDMA (ON MACHINE): Hello, dear. We're here at Santa Barbara, safe and sound. TRAVIS (ON MACHINE): Hi, Mom! GRANDMA (ON MACHINE): I'll call in the morning. Bye. [MACHINE BEEPING] [PHONE DIALING] MAN (ON PHONE): You've reached the concierge. How can I help you? -Uh, yeah. Richard Moore's room, please. MAN (ON PHONE): One moment, please. [PHONE RINGING] I'm sorry, Ma'am. He doesn't answer. Would you like to leave a message? No. No message, thanks. Are you absolutely sure you rang the right room? MAN (ON PHONE): I'm sorry, Ma'am, there's no answer. Would you like to leave a message? Um, no. No message, thanks. [SIGHS] Uh-huh. Well, I don't care what time you got in, Richard, you still should have called. I don't care if you wake me, I just need to know you got there OK. No, listen-- listen, I don't fight about this, OK? Yes, we'll talk about it later. Oh, and I have to go anyway. Yeah. Bye. [GASPS] Oh, hi. Got your check. And I have your clock all packed and ready to roll. Great. Are you parked out back? Well, actually, my car wouldn't start this morning. Can I use your phone to call a taxi? -Yeah. -Have a good one, Faith. See you Monday. -Yeah, sure. Bye. Um, right. Let me dial for you. There you go. I'm just going to lock up, I'll be back in a minute. I'd like to order a cab. Any luck yet? Still holding. It takes forever for a taxi in this town. Where do you live? Because maybe it's on my way. Well, Encino. But, please, I don't want to be a bother. No, you're not a bother. Come on. Here, let me get that. FAITH MOORE: So you're not working on any project at the moment then? Well, I'm lucky. Most architects have to take any work that comes along, but my parents left me enough money so that I can be selective. Hey, aren't we near the Bushman house? Yes, we are. WALTER: I love these old Victorians. FAITH MOORE: They wanted to rip this down and build condos. We stopped them, I just hope we can raise enough money to be able to restore it properly. This house would be so much better in the country. For me, professionally, it would be a home miles and miles away from everything. On top of some huge hill with a view that goes on for eternity. Yeah, I've wanted to live in a place like that since, well, forever really. Why am I not surprised? I can see the inside as well. When you walk through the door there is the most exquisite grandfather clock, at least 100 years old. This house with a view, is it your husband's dream too? It's been a long time since we've talked about anything like dreams. Why is that? Bills, careers, reality, I don't know. I mean, who has time? WALTER: These archways are my favorites. Simple, pure, organic. It really brings the structure to life. And you should see the interior, it's unbelievable. Everything is beautiful and perfectly ordered. The soul can really breathe inside these old buildings. FAITH MOORE: These churches are built to last forever, thankfully. WALTER: Yes, they were. -Have you seen this store? -No. It's got some really cute stuff. Unbelievable! What? You remember I told you about that leather chest I bought in London? -Yeah. That's just like it. Just a little bit smaller. What luck! Come on. Come on. You're like a kid with a new toy. That's because I'm having such a great day. It's about time for dinner, are you hungry? Um, yes. Actually, that would be really nice. Are you sure you don't mind? -No, of course not. -OK. [DOG BARKING] Could you, uh-- -Oh. Yeah, sure. Which key is it? -The brass one. -OK. There you go. -OK. This is just a temporary place, that's why I don't have much furniture. You can put that down right there. I'll be right back. Oh, is this the church you were talking about? WALTER: Yes, it is. It's beautiful. Beautiful, you're right. "Veronica Lange." Did she work for you? Um, yes. She did. Oh, no. I really must be going. Veronica and I were engaged. Unfortunately, we didn't end up happily ever after. Well, what happened? Losing her was one of the hardest things I've ever had to deal with. Did she leave you? Life can be very cruel. Things seem so certain, so solid. And then they're gone. Mm. Don't take things for granted. No, you can't. How about you? -Me? Talking to you this afternoon I couldn't help but sense that something isn't quite right between you and your husband. I don't really want to talk about it. [SIGHS] Veronica used to say the same thing. But talk is the best therapy. [SIGHS] It just doesn't feel the same anymore. I don't know what's happening to us. Are you afraid he might leave you? I know what you're feeling. When we're younger we have so many dreams and then we get older and so many of them get shattered. (CRYING) We were different. This wasn't supposed to happen to us. I know. I love you, Faith. Where are you going? -What? Oh, uh, I have to go home. But nobody's there. It's empty. My husband, he, um, he might call. What if he does? Look, um, this tonight, it's really not me, OK? Maybe it is you. My purse. Where's my purse? Please don't get upset. It's OK, it's in the living room. No matter what happens, I'll be there for you. Oh god. [CAR ALARM SOUNDS] Gardenias. WALTER (ON TELEVISION): Veronica, wake up. Come on. -What's going on? WALTER (ON TELEVISION): It's a full moon. I thought we'd go for a swim. Oh god, Walter. You can't be serious. It's 3:00 AM. Come on. Are you kidding? Walter, I'm tired. Can I just sleep, please? WALTER (ON TELEVISION): You sleep all the time. Please, just let me go back to sleep. WALTER (ON TELEVISION): Get up! Get up! OK, OK, OK. Enough. Richard? -It's me. -Walter? I just wanted to make sure you made it home OK. Yeah, well, I got home but, um, I'm really not OK, Walter. Faith, last night was-- Last night was a mistake. A very, very big mistake. Don't say that. Look, I have made a terrible mess of things and what happened, it has to be forgotten. It wasn't a mistake. It was meant to be. Maybe staying in your marriage is the mistake. He's having an affair, isn't he? Please don't do this to me, Walter. Faith, you're unhappy. With yourself, with your life. But I make you smile. You can talk to me. I have to go. Please. [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Maybe you don't understand. I honestly care about you. Walter, please, you don't understand. [CALL WAITING BEEPS] Look, I've-- I've got another call coming in. Goodbye. Hello? RICHARD MOORE (ON PHONE): Honey, we did it! We did it! -Richard. RICHARD MOORE (ON PHONE): They loved our presentation. We got the account. Great news, isn't it? Yeah, it's, um, I'm really happy for you. You know, when I get back I'm going to have to order some new business cards. New business cards? Ones that read "Richard Moore, Vice President." Vice president! Richard, that's great! The other good news I'm done here in Vegas, so can you pick me up at the office around 3:00? FAITH MOORE (ON PHONE): Yeah, sure. I can't wait to see you, Faith. There's some things I need to tell you. Some things about us. Oh, I've got to get going. I'll be waiting in the lobby. I'll see you. -See you. Hey, Faith. How you doing? I'm all right, Bill. BILL: Just all right? Come on. Cheer up, it's summer! It's sunny! How about a beer? No, thanks. OK, so it's barely lunch time. I won't tell if you won't. -Thanks anyway. No, she needs to hear it. Oh! I am so excited. It's finally coming together for us. Faith, did you hear? Yes, I did. I'm thrilled for all of you. Not about the account. This! Hal proposed to me this morning. You're engaged? Oh, there he is now. See you guys later. Come on, let's go. RICHARD MOORE: Kit and Hal, huh? Amazing. They've been seeing each other for six months and they kept it a secret. Well, now she'll have a personal life and I can get back to my mine. Faith, I'm really sorry about the way I've been handling things lately. You don't have anything to apologize for. Oh, no. I have a lot to apologize for. I let work take over, I took you guys for granted, I-- I-- I won't let it happen again. I have an idea. FAITH MOORE: Oh, would you look, Richard? It hasn't changed a bit. RICHARD MOORE: It's still the prettiest beach in the world And you're still the prettiest girl. FAITH MOORE: Oh, stop. RICHARD MOORE: Come on, let's go for a walk. Last time we came out here was the weekend before I got hired by the agency. Was that eight years ago? Yep. Right after Travis was born. Then we bought the house. Remember our first place? That dump out in [INAUDIBLE]? I don't think we ever made the rent on time. We've come a long way, haven't we? I couldn't have done it without you. You know you're everything to me. [FAITH SHRIEKS] [PHONE RINGS] I'll get it. Hello? Hey there. I tried to call earlier. Um, hi, Leo. Leo? No, it's Walter. (WHISPERING) It's Leo, it'll just take a sec. WALTER (ON PHONE): That was your husband, wasn't it? That's right. I didn't think he was supposed to be there. FAITH MOORE (ON PHONE): Right again. Listen, I'm calling to apologize. We went too fast. Way too fast. This, um, this isn't really a good time for me to talk. I understand. But remember, no matter what happens, I'm there for you. Um, why don't we discuss this at the store tomorrow? Sure. FAITH MOORE (ON PHONE): Bye. Hey! I don't know who the hell you are, but I'm sure the police are going to be real interested. I was just talking a walk. Oh, peeping tom, pervert. What you're doing is sick. I'm calling the cops. No, you're not. Let me go! Let me go! Why did you have to butt in, huh? Huh? Stupid old man! Stupid old man! [PEOPLE TALKING IN BACKGROUND] Perfect. Perfect. [KNOCKING ON WINDOW] What are you doing here? You said we could talk about things today. Walter, I thought I made things very clear. You left this at my place. Thank you. It's nothing. You understand my situation, don't you? I guess. But what happens when your husband leaves? He's not going to leave. He wasn't having an affair, Walter. He's lying. Men lie all the time. Well, you don't even know him. Or us. I have to get back to work. Two nights ago, we made love and now you're treating me like I don't even exist? Walter, I shouldn't have done it, OK? Maybe I led you on, maybe-- well, what do you want me to say? I apologized! You don't have anything to apologize for. Let me make this very, very clear. I am married. I have a husband. Yes, we have had some problems but that is between us, not you. Can't we talk? You know, just to be friends? We can't be friends, Walter. We can't be anything. Goodbye. I have feelings too. What we shared meant a lot to me. That was the guy from the auction. What were you doing talking to him outside? It can't be that bad. It's that bad. See this? I left it at his house Saturday night. He was just returning it. His house? [SPEAKING SPANISH] My god, Faith. What possessed you? -I don't know. I've been asking myself that over and over. You know, I do know. I was lonely and he was listening. And I thought Richard was having an affair, but it wasn't Richard, it's me. Me! I've been unfaithful! God, Willa, how am I going to tell him? Tell him? Well, of course, we've always been honest with each other. And I've always been honest with you. Here. [SPEAKING SPANISH] Give me these. Voila! They're gone. No, I have to come clean, Willa! I cannot live with this lie! If you want to unload your guilt, go to confession. Do you love Richard? Of course I do. And you don't want to hurt him, do you? No, of course I don't. But-- But what? There is no reason to tell Richard. If you tell him, it'll screw everything up and your marriage is over. Here, look at me. You're sorry you did it, right? Right! And you're not going to do it again? Right. So you see, there you have it. Case closed. Get on with your life. Get on with my life? I can't just make it disappear. Just do it. There's a lot more than just you and Richard. Well, just think about Travis and what this could do to him. You're in control, just remember that. Yeah, but what about this guy? Forget him. And he'll forget about you. Trust me. Once a guy gets you into bed, he's on to his next conquest. OK, fellas, lunch time! Hey, I invited our new neighbor for lunch, is that OK? Oh, the new neighbor. Yeah, they rented the house across the street. Yeah, great. I mean, there's tons, as long as they don't mind leftovers. I love leftovers. Walter, my wife, Faith. Faith, Walter York. Nice to meet you. Uh, my hands, they're sticky. I need to wash them. Seems every time the movers lose something. Last time it was a clock, this time my toolbox. Mm. You need to borrow anything? If you have a drill, that would be great. Hey, Trav, do me a favor. Get the drill out of the tool box. It's out front where we were working this morning. Sure. Then can I go to Randy's? Then you can go to Randy's, yes. He's a great kid. RICHARD MOORE: Yeah, he is. WALTER: You sure seem to have it all. Great house, wife, son. I want the same for myself one day. RICHARD MOORE: So it's just you? WALTER: At the moment. Delicious, Faith, just delicious. Thanks for having me. RICHARD MOORE: Honey, aren't you going to join us? Um, uh, no. I must have nibbled too much when I was getting it ready. TRAVIS: Dad, I can't find it! It's in the-- oh, forget it. He'll never find it. Excuse me, I'll be right back. Let me give you a hand with that. What the hell are you doing here? -Trying to keep you safe. -What? So you move in across the street? You are insane! You cannot do this! And leave you alone? No way. I am not alone. You are. Have you told Richard about us? Just get out of here. He doesn't know, huh? Walter, what do you want from me? I want you to be happy. To help you, not to hurt you. That's why I'm not going to tell him anything. But I know you, and I know what kind of person you are, and eventually you'll listen to your conscience, to your heart, and then you'll tell Richard about us. There is no us! Here you go, Walter. You're a lifesaver. Well, I hate to eat and run, but I've still got some more boxes to unpack. Yeah, I hear you. It's nice meeting you, Faith. -Yeah, bye. -Thanks for lunch. Come on, I'll show you out. Bastard. OK, there you go. -Thank you. 500? Faith, try $50. I'm sorry, I'm just not really with it today. WILLA MARTINEZ: That's right, hold it inside. Get an ulcer. See if your best friend cares. FAITH MOORE: All right. You want to know what's going on? Try this for size. Guess who Richard brought to the house this weekend? WILLA MARTINEZ: Who? FAITH MOORE: Walter York. WILLA MARTINEZ: No! FAITH MOORE: Mm-hmm. And guess where Walter is living now. WILLA MARTINEZ: Where? FAITH MOORE: In the house right across the street from me. WILLA MARTINEZ: You're not serious. FAITH MOORE: Walter York isn't giving up. He's crazy, Willa. Crazy! Gardenias. TRAVIS: Mom, can I have a cookie? FAITH MOORE: No, Travis. You know the rules. No cookies after 8:00. TRAVIS: Not even one? FAITH MOORE: Afraid not. RICHARD MOORE: Oh, Willa called while you were in the shower. FAITH MOORE: [INAUDIBLE] RICHARD MOORE: She said she was going to bed. She'll call you in the morning after her run. Sorry, kiddo. The bishop does that, not the knight. I forgot. OK, gentlemen, I'm going to turn in. -Are you feeling OK? -Oh, yeah. I'm fine, it's just been a long week. Nothing else? FAITH MOORE: Nothing else. Night-night, trouble. Don't stay up too late. TRAVIS: I won't. It's so good having you home, love. Makes two of us. Go ahead, it's still your turn. TRAVIS: Hmm, can I do this? RICHARD MOORE: Yeah, you sure can. You just nailed me, pal. TRAVIS: Yeah! FAITH MOORE: Willa, there has got to be some law, something that makes what he's doing illegal. Well, yeah. Sure there are. There's lots of laws on stalking and harassment, but you need solid proof that this man is a threat to your life. Dammit, I don't know anything about him. I don't know why he's doing this. That's it. That's why he has the upper hand. I don't know anything about him. If I can find something that I can use against him, then maybe I can convince Walter York to disappear from my life. Sounds perfect. Exactly what we've been dreaming about. Any chance that I could check it out any sooner? Yeah, I'll see you then. [CHATTER OVER MONITOR] FAITH MOORE: --he'll probably lose it. End up in jail on assault. WILLA MARTINEZ: Try manslaughter. FAITH MOORE: OK, I'll see you when I get back from Santa Fe. Butt out, bitch. Excuse me, Walter, but I think we need to have a talk. Can I come in? -Well, I was-- You know that Faith is my best friend and you really upset her by renting this place. I don't think it's any of your business to tell me where to live. Well, I'm making it my business. And I'm not going to let you do this to her. So here's the plan. I'm going out of town for a week, so that gives you seven days to move out. And when I come back I expect this place to be empty and you just a bad memory. What goes on between Faith and I is between us. I'm asking you nicely, Walter. I think it's time for you to vamos. OK, fine. Listen, you creep! You're making my best friend's life hell, and it's going to stop! It's going to stop now! You ever hear of [SPEAKING SPANISH]? No. Well, it's my cousin's gang and this time next week they'll be making a house call. I hope you're not around. You're serious. Look, uh, I don't want any trouble. I really thought Faith was OK about me being here. -Oh yeah, right. -No, really. All she had to do was come out and tell me, point blank. Well, I'm telling you for her. All right. All right. I hear where you're coming from. Smart man. Stupid woman. Veronica. Saint Jules. Willa Martinez. Allestree Avenue. Have a nice trip. Look what you've done. Good afternoon. FAITH MOORE (ON PHONE): Yes, hello. Is that Saint Jules? -It sure is. How may I help you? I'm calling from the Los Angeles Restoration Society about an architect named Walter York. He put your church down as a reference. Mr. York, what a gentleman! Always a smile and a nice word wherever he went. They did such a beautiful job. It saved our church, you know. -They? Oh, of course. That was Walter York and-- what was her name? Veronica Lange. Veronica Lange, yes. You wouldn't happen to know where I might find her, would you? Mrs. Lange is dead, Ma'am. Dead? Um, I'm-- I'm so sorry. Her husband, you wouldn't happen to know where I might be able to find him, would you? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Well, actually, before she came to work with us her husband left her and Mr. York helped her a lot. They became close friends. Is there anything else I can help you with? No. No, thank you. You've been most helpful. WOMAN (ON PHONE): No problem. What went on there? Ask him. Hey, neighbor. Thanks for the loan. Evening, Walter. Just put it on the work bench. OK, here goes nothing. Now, like I said. You mind if I take a look? Sure. And the day after graduation, we got married. And about three years later, her mother moved here from England, and all the rest is history. You're a lucky man. She's one of a kind. That she is. So what about you? Are you involved? Actually, I'm unofficially engaged. Unofficially engaged? Well, that's one I haven't heard. -She's still married. -Married? But not for long. Her husband treats her like dirt. He's been cheating on her for months. That sounds messy. Very messy. But he won't be in the picture for long. When that happens, we leave L.A. behind. I think this should about do it. You want to kill the juice again? I've got to get someone out here to fix this damn thing. It trips every time we turn on too many lights or appliances. Hey. Hi. How was Pasadena? It was fine. Did Travis get to bed OK? He sure did. Good. Hello, Faith. Hi, Walter. So Walter fixed the garage door opener. Pretty good, huh? Yeah, that's wonderful. Thank you, Walter. Did, um, Richard invite you to the barbecue we're having? Barbecue? Yeah, it would be a nice way to introduce you to the neighbors. I'd like that. Well, it's getting late, I'd better go. Goodnight. -Thanks, Walter. Goodnight. I knew it would happen. It had to happen. She's figuring it out. She's figuring out that I'm the man of her dreams. Great shindig, Faith. It feels so good to relax. And that neighbor of yours, Walter? If I wasn't engaged, I don't know. Oh, don't let that stop you. And here we have our hostess with the mostess. The one and only, Faith Moore. Inquiring minds want to know, how do you keep yourself so young and gorgeous? Oh, I let someone like you flip the burgers? OK. Rare, medium, or well? Ooh, uh, go wild. You know, when I was little I always used to look forward to summer. I think that's why I like living out here. Summer all year round. Nothing like England, huh? Hardly. Georgia must be like this, isn't it? Except we'd be drinking mint juleps. -I always hated those things. -Oh yeah? What about Veronica? She's from the South, isn't she? Veronica? Uh, no. She was from Seattle. Seattle? Oh, what's that like? I hear it's charming. -I don't know. I've never been there. So you never got to meet her parents? One time. Ed and Leona Fabrizio. Nice people. Real Italian. Hm. We must be very different, she and I. Yes and no. Yes and no? She needed help and never figured that out. You have. WALTER (ON TELEVISION): And here we have our hostess with the mostess. The one and only, Faith Moore. Inquiring minds want to know, how do you keep yourself so young and gorgeous? Oh, I let someone like you flip the burgers? I let someone like you flip the burgers? Someone like me. Someone like me. Richard didn't flip any burgers. FAITH MOORE (ON TELEVISION): I let someone like you flip the burgers. I let someone like you flip the burgers. Hello, is this Ed Fabrizio? Hi, my name's Faith, but you don't know me. First of all, I just want to say I'm very, very sorry to hear about your daughter. The reason I'm calling, Mr. Fabrizio, is that I need your help. I have to find out some information about your daughter and Walter York. No, wait. No, please! Please, just hear me out! Oh. Where do you think we should put this? Um, how about over there? Fine. [PHONE RINGS] Carson Antiques, this is Faith. What? No, there-- there must be some mistake. I-- Faith, what is it? What's wrong? Oh my god. Oh my god. It's Willa. She's dead. -What? My god, how? She was mugged when she was jogging. She was murdered! [INAUDIBLE] How did this happen? Faith! I came as fast as I could. What did the police say? FAITH MOORE: I don't know. I think they only found her body this morning. Oh, Richard-- RICHARD MOORE: I know. I know. It's so horrible. FAITH MOORE: Listen, Richard, um, I need you to sit down. I need to tell you something. RICHARD MOORE: Tell me something? FAITH MOORE: Sit down. Willa's death has made me realize that I have made a mess of things. What do you mean? She's going to tell him! Before, um, you went to Las Vegas, before your promotion, you were working all these hours and, um, I just-- I started thinking crazy things. Crazy things like what? I thought you were having an affair with Kit. What? Well, you were spending all that time with her, and then I found her earring in your things. Her earring? She dropped it in the car. I was going to return it to her. Richard, I really thought you were going to leave me. Faith-- Just let me finish. I was a wreck. I was confused. I-- I don't know how it happened. But it did, and-- What happened? I slept with someone. What? Finally, Faith. Finally. -Who? -Walter. What? Walter? I'm going to break every bone in his body! I'm going to go over there and tear him to pieces! That low-life snake! He comes to our house-- WOMAN (ON PHONE): 911, what's your emergency? You need to send someone to Homestead Lane. My neighbor's threatening to kill me. Is this some kind of sick, twisted joke? Richard, you don't know how many times I tried to tell you. So why are you telling me now, huh? You want a divorce? -No! No, he means nothing to me! I can't stand the sight of him! Don't lie, Faith. Tell the truth. Your lover moved in across the street! He is not my lover! It was just one night! OK? One night! I told him I didn't want to see him again, but he just wouldn't leave me alone! I didn't know he was moving in until he came into our home with you! I'm not blind, Faith! OK? I saw the two of you at the barbecue together! You were laughing up a storm! That is not the reason I invited him! What did I do to deserve this, huh? He deceived me. You deceived me. The both of you played me! Richard, no, wait! No, don't go over there! Richard, please. He might do something! Richard-- -Go home! York! York, open the door! York! Richard, what's going on? Richard, no! You messed with the wrong guy, Mr. Please, Richard, let's just go home. You finally told him about us, good. We don't have to hide anymore. How could you? You've got to stop him! He's threatening to kill me! He's crazy! Hands in the air! Now! Walter York has broken no laws, Ma'am. FAITH MOORE: You haven't been listening to a word I've been saying! He will not leave me alone! He's now moved into the house across the street! And he can live next door if he wants. It's your husband who broke the law, do you understand? You're both lucky Mr. York isn't pressing charges. Although he might ask the court for a restraining order against you, Mr. Moore. This is all wrong! Wrong or right, this is not a police matter. This is a domestic situation that you three are going to have to sort out for yourselves. I hope you people can work this out peacefully. Great. I'm leaving, Faith. Richard, no. Please, this is exactly what he wants you to do. Slam dunk. Exactly what he wants? What are you, a mind reader now? Or maybe everything you told me is just one big lie. No, it's not a lie. He's just twisting everything! My god, you are the married woman that he was talking about! Please-- Oh! Damn you! [CAR STARTS] Bye-bye, Richard. [CAR SPEEDS AWAY] It's time to get busy. OK, here we go. When is Dad coming home? Soon, sweetheart. He'll be home soon. I just don't get it. Did you guys fight or something? Just remember that your Dad and I, we love you very, very much, OK? OK. Time to go to sleep. Here, let's put Bear in. [INAUDIBLE] Night-night. [DOORBELL RINGS] WALTER: Faith, it's me. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Just checking to see if you're all right. He left you, didn't he? Leave me alone! WALTER: I'm not you-know-who. I'll never leave you alone. Look, just go away, Walter. Go away! WALTER: I'm the only person you have left! Now open the door. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Faith, tomorrow will come and you'll realize that you can't hold on to the past. You have to embrace the future. Us. [DOOR UNLOCKS] Faith. Oh, Richard. He's not supposed to come back. Oh, Richard! This isn't fair! We need some time away from here if we're going to try and get things back on track. If we can get things back on track. You're right. I'll call the airlines tomorrow. We'll go to Hawaii or something. I'm glad you came back. No! We have too many years invested with each other. We've got to try to work this out. There is nothing to work out! You don't know how sorry I am. No, you're not. Wake up! And you don't know how much you've hurt me. But I know I share some of the blame. I wasn't there for you. You think you're smart, Mr. Moore. You think you got it all figured out. Well, you think again. [DOG BARKING] RICHARD MOORE: What time is it? FAITH MOORE: Richard, the clock stopped. Oh, damn. The electricity went out again. -Mm. I'll get the fuse box. How about some juice? Yeah, sure. [SCREAMING] Richard? Richard! Richard, oh my god! Oh my god! Just hang on, baby! So did you and Travis get there OK? Great. Thanks, Mummy. Um, well, he's sedated now. Yeah. He's had a mild heart attack. They've got some more tests to run on him tomorrow, but the doctor said he's going to be OK. Yeah. Um. Yeah, I know. Yeah. OK, I'll-- I'll talk to you later. Bye. What a bizarre accident, Faith. I've heard of things like this before, but I can never imagine them really happening. Every night in the news they report a murder or a robbery. But why Willa? Why any of this? Why Veronica? Walter. -Who? I have to go home for a couple of hours. Can I do anything to help? Oh, no. You've been more helpful than you can know. [DOOR UNLOCKS] [PHONE RINGS] FAITH MOORE (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Hi, we can't come to the phone right now, so leave a message. GRANDMA (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): Faith, it's Mom. Just checking to see if you got home, dear. I'll try again later. He's heard everything. Veronica. I can't even brush my teeth without you, can I? Nope. I'm you're prized monkey from the zoo. Feed me, Walter. Watch me perform. Watch the monkey perform. OK, well, I'll do monkey tricks for you, OK? Knowing how you love to watch everything I do, Walter, I thought you'd like to see this. When my husband left me, you said that you'd do anything for me. You said that you wanted to help me, and I believed you. But it wasn't true. Instead, you lured me into your world. You fed me pills. You turned me into a walking zombie. The walking dead. You never loved me, Walter. You just wanted to control me. Well, I am taking my life back now. It's out of your control. There's nothing you can do about it. It's out of your control. [GUN COCKS] Completely out of your control. [GUNSHOT] WALTER: You wouldn't do anything so dramatic, would you? [FAITH GASPS] Come on, we have to go. The sun is shining. No Richard. No Willa. Just me and my baby. Richard. Willa. It was you, wasn't it? Everything was me, Faith. But just you wait and see. You're going to like it that way. They'll find us, Walter. How are they going to find us when even you don't know where we're going? Oh, I took the liberty and bought you a few things. You're a size two, right? There's so much time that we have to make up for, Faith. All those years we spent apart never knowing that we were meant to be together. Now, here we are, just the two of us. We're going to be happy. I feel it, Faith. I feel it deep inside. It's-- well, it's destiny. Home. Over 400 years old, just like you wanted. It doesn't look like much now, but I had to bring you here sooner than I thought. Besides, I wanted your input on the decoration. You've got a good eye. Come on. So what's the verdict? It's what you've always dreamed about, Faith. What I've always dreamed about? You know, you're completely mad. Completely mad. Your anger is clouding your vision. Detach yourself from your past, Faith. Hell, you've been given a new shot at life and you can thank me for it. Thank you? Hm. Thank you for nearly killing my husband, and for brutally murdering my best friend? Go to hell, Walter! Don't talk like some $20 whore, Faith. It cheapens you. Don't? Oh, no. Hang on a minute. Of course, you want to treat me like Veronica, don't you? Pull my strings, see if I can dance. Sorry, wrong girl. Now, listen, I have a husband and a child waiting for me at home. Goodbye, Walter. What are you doing? You say you love me, Walter? If you love me, you won't kill me. You're the one who's talking mad now. This is your home. Here, with me! [GUNSHOT] You take another step, and I'll shoot you in the leg. And don't expect some hospital with any fat-ass nurses. You'll be in bed for months with me taking care of you. I thought you would see it my way. Hey, how about a glass of wine? Did I tell you that the closest neighbor is more than 10 miles away? Just thought you'd like to know. You're not like Veronica, I know that. You're persistent, which I find attractive, but that means you're going to try to resist me for a while. In time, though, you'll realize what a fool you've been, and we'll be able to look back on all of this and laugh. You've got an appetite, that's good. At one point, Veronica didn't eat for almost a week. She could be so thick-headed. You know, Walter, I'm curious. There are so many available women, why me? Simple, Faith. I saw it immediately. You were lost. You needed help. You needed a shoulder to cry on and I gave that to you. But you dried your tears, and you waltzed right back to your husband and you tried to pretend I didn't even exist. Let me ask you a question, Faith. Why did you let him turn you into a doormat? You deserve better than that. You know it, and I know it, but there's something screwy in your head that keeps you from realizing I'm the man for you. I'm not going to live here, with you or anyone. Give me the knife. You think I'm different than Veronica, but you're wrong, Walter. I'm just like her. You see, I was stupid enough to trust you. But I'm also smart enough to know when to take back control. Don't even talk that way. No! Why, Faith, why? Come back here! [GUNSHOT] You're acting foolish. Why are you giving up on this? I was wrong about you. You're not the one. You're not her. You're not going anywhere. Not without me. [GUNSHOT] [MUSIC PLAYING]
