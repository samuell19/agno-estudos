Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK Subtitles by explosiveskull During the human wars many people died, if it was the Ukranians creating a virus to wipe out Russia or the U.S. Setting off nuclear weapons to Iraq very few humans survived. After the wars, governments fell and civilians took over, creating their own leaders. Only 10 countries remained and divided up the world. Those countries were collectively known as sectors. The U.S. Sector grew to be the biggest and most powerful of them all. But humans are not the only ones who walk this planet. Deviants are also living throughout the sectors, hidden and trying to stay alive. I am one of them and like many others I fight against those who want to rid the planet of the gifted ones. It began with the civil battles where humans would control our powers with UV charges. Each year humans capture and torture Deviants. They then force them to fight and kill each other to find their vanquisher. The one that would represent their Sector at the main tournament Dominion's Battle. Dominion's Battle, an event created by madman Dominion Harvey. He runs and operates The Immortal Wars, a television show aired to the entire world. This fight is held by the U.S. and it has become the world's biggest entertainment corporation. Humans wait all year for this day. These are dark days and the darkest of them all is when the world will watch us fight to the death. That's not the one. Bag her up, let's take her. Hey. You are a vanquisher? Can you make sure the guards have these things fully charged at all times. I still don't know why we use these things. What are you, brain dead? These UV rays are the only thing keeping your ass alive. Without these we'd lose all control. Little obsessive, don't you think? Did you develop a soft spot for the skags? You're old, Costa, and you're weak. Maybe that's why you've been making all those little mistakes in the field. Like I said, that was out of my control. Yeah, but it was still your team though, wasn't it? I can't wait to see what Dominion has to say about all this. Considering you're number one on his shit list now. Sir, they're asking for you. Have fun. Move. What is this place? Well it looks like a jail, doesn't it? Now move, skag. No, you've got to tell me what's... You wanna try again? This is your home now. You better get real comfy, skag. Sir. What is it? You requested my presence. Sir, I apologize for my mistake. Would you like a drink? No, I'm fine thank you. So what happened today? It was a small mistake, my guys they... Ah ah, get one thing straight. These are my guys. They didn't secure the Deviant correctly and it escaped. So a group of highly trained guards made a mistake that gave my Deviant the chance to escape. A mistake that risked everything. My Sector, my network my show. Sir I apologize. Son, how long have you been fighting for us? Since I was valid. Which is? Six years. You know mistakes can never happen. There's no time for them. Yes sir and I promise it will never happen again. It will never happen again. Guards, can you please take the trash out. What trash? Did you hear? Costa expired this morning. How? They said he shot himself right in the head. That's bullshit. They got him for what his team did. You serious? Yeah, you think there's time for mistakes? No but hey that just give us a chance to move up. I'm okay with that. Right. Hey you think the game's gonna be as brutal this year as last year? They can all kill each other for all I care. As long as they're not on our streets. What's wrong with you? How did a girl like you make it this far? It's not my choice to be here, they forced me. We all were. So tell me your story. How'd you end up here? There is no story, I wasn't supposed to be here. I'm tired of fighting. But I will do what I have to do to survive. I just want to be free and live the life I have left. Yeah me too. L talk to me. We're good. How good? We're broadcasting to all Sectors. Russia, Africa, Mexico each one's ready for us. That's why I love you. Now time to greet our special guests. What will you do when we're in front of the world? I won't fight you. When the time comes I will fight you and I will win. You think you can beat Nyx Moros? You ask as if it's going to be hard. She is a monster, a murderer. She killed her own brother for this sick game. The god of Deserts and storms. I told you, you can't win. I'm stronger than you. No you're wrong. I'm stronger. But I couldn't hurt my own family. You see that's the difference between you and I. When we were forced into this, this game, I put to side the fact that you were my brother, and I made you my enemy. This is the end, you ready to die? We both know this isn't the end of me. Give them what they want. Seth was one of the strongest deviants known to man. Nothing will stop her from killing anyone who gets in her way. Maybe this will. This place is surrounded by UV lines. We can't use any of our powers, they control it all. So tell me about yourself. We are going to be here for a while, might as well know a little bit about my next victim. I'm just messing around. Well, I was seven when my family found out. Found out what? What I am. They grew hatred towards me, so I ran away and started over. I then began to fight for those who needed help. But then when I found out what I was capable of I got... You okay? So what's your name? Olive, Olive Summerlin. No, I meant what do they call you? What do they call you? Oh uh, Trikalypse. Cool. You? Iro. Cool. How about something to eat? How about something to eat? Maybe, skag. I said maybe, skag. Maybe you oughta come into this cell, huh? You know what? That sounds like a good idea. Really? - Come on. - You know what they say. Once you go black, they never come back. Maybe next time princess. I want something to eat! What does that do? It scans the body, it records strength, power, health. It's how they know who to pair us up with for each fight. How do you know all this? I knew I would be here some day. I looked into everything. I did my research and prepared myself. Step forward skag. She thought that you were me, huh? Step forward for evaluation! Hey I'm sorry, I didn't hear you there. You can try to keep us in here, but it ain't gonna work, you know why? There's a revolution coming, brother. I'm gonna make sure your black ass dies first. I'd love to see that. You will see that. See if you can get your power off before I put two hollow points between your eyes. Gentlemen, for years the world has been divided. Rich and poor, strong and weak. And the question is which category do you fall into? As we witnessed, the last year of the feathers the Phoenix rose to be the Victor and as we all know this is the age of the snake. Every 365 days we work hard and prepare for today's events. The day our people come together and watch how we're making the world a better place. Now it's time to reveal which serpent will represent your sector at the table. France we'll begin with you. The Black Mumba. Very Confident I see, great choice. Mexico. The Blood Python. The River Jack. The Siamese palm viper. The Canebrake. The Nightingale adder. The Copperhead. The Blue krait. Russia. The Emerald boa. The King Cobra. Who will be victorious this year? Blackout, Germany, skilled assassin. Developed super human Senses and environmental radar. Bloodshed, England, ability to drain and absorb energy from others. Atmo, Australia, ability to manipulate the elements of the earth. Sin, Africa, super strength, ability to generate the dark force and summon her children from the underworld. Karly and The Tank, Russia. Karly, ability to scan the future and telepathically communicate with her partner. What a child. The Tank generates superhuman strength. Aiolos, Ukraine, Olympic Martial Artist, ability to generate extreme speed and strength. The Charge, France, ability to generate and expel electricity. Iro, Mexico, ability to manipulate and control fire. Dekay, India, skilled assassin, ability of breath and touch generating the dark force. Very interesting. Trikalypse, United States, telekinesis, superstrength and durability, telepathy, ability to absorb powers with body contact. I take it we have all selected our battle grounds? The time for entry is now, please proceed to cell block four. They say she's a god. They say Nyx Moros is an Egyptian god. How else do you think she was able to kill Seth? Looks good. I take it this is for the show. We are the stars. So what happens next? Well now that they have scanned us. They are going to ranks us one through 10. That will then determine who we fight first. Then what happens after that? Right now we are all going to be visited by 10 individuals. The ones who brought us here. Then they will register us for entry. Then it begins. We will be hit by the shrill three times. We will be to weak to stand. And then we'll be announced to the world of who we are and what we can do. Then the final 24 hours of our lives begin to count down. Get me the hell out of here! Haven't you noticed you're surrounded by steel? You could have escaped by now if you wanted to. But no, here you are caged. Why is that? Nowhere to go, nothing to return to. Let's get something perfectly straight right now. This is your life now. You have nowhere else to go. This is not my life, this was a diversion, a distraction. All I have to do now is just sit back and watch it crumble around you. Better yet, I'll listen to the distraction carry on. I am done fighting for you. Game over! You've clearly lost your mind. Dominion didn't come. You're registered automatically. You actually think he'll come down here? What are they going to do to him? They're taking him down to cell block one. What's in cell block one? Cell block one is no cell block its more like the sewers chambers. A dark hall that not even a speck of sunlight will ever shine. Its said that Dominion throws any deviant that does not obey his laws and for those who cannot take captivity well. They are only fed medications that slowly kill them. They say some of them are also used for genetic experimentations. Leo. Who is he? Our replacement. He replaces us if any one of us does not make it to registration. Think of it as him being on standby. They announced him months before the civil battles. And we are locked in. We are locked and ready to go. Gentlemen, it is now show time. May the strongest win. Okay we are in, In 5 4... Hello citizens of the world. It Is that time of the age again. The time all our hard work and dedication will be put to the test. In years past we have witnessed some heartfelt moments. - Hey it's starting, come on. - We have watched some of the greatest succeed and some fail. But this year it will be one for the books. In my hand I have the list of the Immortal Wars VQ's. Now I don't know about you, but I am beyond excited for this year's selections. I've even heard that this year one of the strongest Deviants ever recorded in history. Now let us begin. First up we have The Charge with a rank of a five. Next we have Atmo ranked at a six. England's Leo ranked with a number seven. Karly and The Tank ranked together at a seven. Sin is also a seven. Iro ranked at an eight. Aiolos with a rank of an eight. Blackout ranked at an eight. Dekay ranked at a nine. And finally last but not least, Trikalypse ranked at a 10. Now I know this has never happened before in the ages of the Immortal Wars, but this is history in the making. So on behalf of the city of Lambent, let the battles begin. My moneys on the US. No India's got it, she looks ruthless. $100 down for the US make it the third round. This years going to a good year, huh? Yes it is. Wait she was right. Weakest versus strongest. Eliminate the weak so the strong have to fight against each other. It will make for a great show. How do you know all this? Like I said I did my research. Research gives you only so much information, you know everything. When you said that you knew you would be here, you actually meant you wanted to be here, am I right? You're right, I chose to be here. My mother was killed five years ago at the 10th age Immortal Wars. She didn't make it past the second round. She was in contact with my father through one of Dominion's slaves. But Dominion found out and had her killed as well as my father soon after. But not before he told me everything. That's why I'm here. Dominion will pay for what he has done and nothing's gonna stop me. That's not the job for one person. It's bigger than you, it's bigger than both of us. It's not one man that needs to be stopped, it's the whole government. We've been forced to forget what peace is. Then what do we do? We play, we fight, and we survive. But we don't entertain. Five man. Oy, what makes you so special huh? How about you come in here and I can show you. I mean it, let me show you. Tempting, however let's bring our romance to the battlefield. Hi, what's your name? I'm Karly, this is The Tank. How is our leading lady doing? Well since you asked quite excited. I was able to get a glimpse of the top 10. I hope you weren't disappointed. No, so when I win the final round what happens? You will receive your awards. Which are? Power, freedom. Then lets get this thing started. Well citizens it is time. Please stop what you are doing and join us in this new age of the Immortal Wars. Our representatives have been matched and first up we have Leo Versus Black. Now this will Germany's strongest fighter since about two years ago. They have had some rough times. England, on the other hand, has dominated. However, they have had to remove their primary fighter due to medical reasons. Leo has been selected to fill those shoes. Okay lets bring up the lights. Environment bring up the sound. Easy, easy, easy, nice and slow. And, go. So are you ready? Are you? A great way to start the show. Good one. How was that? You shouldn't have done that. Now that's the way to start a show! Who will be next? Stay tuned after this quick break. Tank I don't want to die. This is wrong. How do we even have a chance against each other if they make us so weak before each fight. Before each fight they're going to inject us with UV Charges. It's a small dose but enough to spike up our energy, powers, strength. The next couple of fights are going to go by fast. They're gonna save the strongest for last and get rid of the weak first. Then it will be us against each other. Who's next? The kid. They say you're a nine, huh? I've seen better. Watch this. You really need to be working more on your fighting skills. Like that? Yeah, like that. Watch this. Is this what you wanted to see, huh? Is this what you wanted to see? Tighter Tank, squeeze tighter. Please don't make me do this. For being a 10 you're really are not that strong. Please. I don't want to fight her! But I will for freedom. And so will I. Yikes. She got him. I'm sorry. Tank! Tank, get up. Please get up. Well that was a very rough round. But that is what this game is about. The display of strength and power. I gotta say did you all see that coming from Iro? It's like she couldn't take the beating anymore and just snapped! Well now is the time to get more drinks, serve yourself up with some more grub, pay for your losses and collect on your winnings, because we have the quarter finals coming right after these messages. We will be right back with some more Immortal Wars. I killed her kids. I Killed three children. Make me live. Yes sir. You're in. Hello representatives this is Dominion Harvey. I wanted to congratulate you all for making it to the next round. And take the time to share something. The one thing we all have in common is death, the only difference is how it happens. Your lives are not yours anymore, they belong to me. Do what you were born to do fight, kill, die and your passing will be one of honor. Now, If you withstand my wishes, I promise you agony in the lights that you never could envision conceivable. Thank you. What do we do now, he's on to us? We continue to play his game. Gentlemen that was a pretty entertaining round wasn't it? Russia what happened? I was rooting for you. I thought I made it clear to you all you had to have entered your strongest fighter. All I see here is a group of scared creatures, Lets see if the final five can make the next round more superior. If not there will be some extreme changes to come. Are you with me? Good. How many times have I told you not to do that? Just play like normal kids, okay? What are they doing? I don't know. 2, 3, it's even now. What do you mean? Well, now that they took Blackout, there's an even number of fighters. You're right. What are they up to? So, how's everything looking? We did have some interference from an unknown signal but I took care of it, other than that we are good. All perished deviants have been transferred to cell block two and we're just about ready for the quarter finals. Great. What environments do we have left? Let's see, Death Lands, Forest of Ice, and the streets of Lambent. This round should be good. What if they make us fight each other? They won't. They're going to put me against Dekay. We are both the strongest. He's a business man, he'll put us together last. He knows we're friends, it'll make good TV. And when that time comes we strike. Okay, you've got this. You got this, Olive. No, me, take me! I'm fighting her! Iro! Take me! Olive. This is all out of our control. I can't fight. You're going to have to. No don't make me give them that. I won't fight you! You think I want to die? Huh? I don't stand a chance against you! I am walking into my own grave when I go into that battle ground with you! Nice shots. Nice try, now it's my turn. You're a tough one aren't you? You have no idea. You actually thought you could beat me, didn't you? Tell me, how were you going to defeat Nyx if even I am to much for you? I never wanted Nyx. Tell me. If not Nyx, then who? Dominion. But if you get in my way I'll kill you too. That's it. Taste your power. What did you do to her? What we are here for? Crazy bitch. What I did I did to be free and now I'm just one steps ahead of you. I suggest you do the same, survive. Because I can't wait to have the chance to kill you. Now that is what I'm talking about! That was amazing. Dekay has no remorse she's a killer. I want to fight her. Well, well now we still have two more fights. You make sure you win this one got it? I'm not fighting you. Oh really? Is that right? You know they won't let you just walk out of here. You have to fight. I will not. Did you hear that? I will not fight anymore! Did she just do that? Take care of this. I told you I don't want to fight any more. There you go. Why are you smiling? Please, don't do this. Win, you have to survive. Make Dominion pay. Please. You got this. You're forcing me to do this. Do it. What is she doing? Cut it, cut it now. It looks like she checked if he was still alive. Is what she did not allowed? What she did made us look bad. What she did shows the world she is good and she cares. The purpose of these games are to show that you are all to blame for what happened to this planet and that you are all the enemy. That last round was pretty good. A bit sad at times, but overall good. I bet Harvey has a boot up his ass. What do you mean. What that girl Trikalypse did. I don't think he's happy about that. She really made him look bad. Thank you. Wait, hold on, is this correct? Those are the orders. What is it? Can you bring up the sound from the last fight? Yes sir. What exactly are you looking for? They were talking through out the fight. I want to know what was said. Okay here it is. Win, you have to survive, make Dominion pay. Please. You got this. Make me pay, huh? Don't worry, I won't hurt you. I know you won't. Well, well, well look at us. The last two standing. Dekay don't talk. Come on, after all we've been through I am glad it is just us left. This should be good. This is exciting. And why is that? Because the entire world is going to watch me win and witness the death of Trikalypse. Why? Why are you doing this? Why are you giving them a show? - We are all the same. - No. I am something more. I am something bigger and more powerful. Let me show you. I almost had you. Your poor little Iro didn't have it so easy. Stop this. You're giving them what they want. Isn't that the point? To give them a show. It's not going to happen, stop trying. Oh bitch, you haven't even seen me try. Can't you see the world needs some one like me. Someone who can win. Attention fighters, there has been a change to your orders. Three fighters must battle it out for the last available spot. Here we go. Our viewers are jumping up by the thousands sir. Excellent. He's here to kill us. No shit. No this is different. They did something to him, he's a puppet. Once he's dead, we will finish what we started. They're controlling you! You can fight this. Just kill me. I'm sorry. Bro, did that really just happen? Yeah. That was awesome. Can't you see, its not how strong you are, it's about how you use your power. There I win! Nyx Moros where are you? This is my show. What's going on here? Geeze, sir, I uh... Did she win? Yeah, yeah she did. I've been rooting for her the whole time. You watch this? Yeah, who doesn't? Send me in. Prepare for the final battle. Oh and can you have a round of those drinks for our guests in the executive chamber? Yes sir. Thank you. Come on, what is this? Awe She did put up a good fight. That's it push it. Give it all you got. I'm going to kill you. Jankins? What the hell are you doing? It's sad that you don't see it. That power you have pointing at me this very second. What gives us the right to have it more than them? What makes us any different? You're right. Let's settle this like humans. Enough, we have to save what little humanity we have left. No, there's the different between me and you, pretty boy. You'll never have what it takes to survive. And it begins. Subtitles by explosiveskull
