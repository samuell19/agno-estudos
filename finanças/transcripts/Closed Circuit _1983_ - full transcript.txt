SYSTEM WITHOUT SHADOW Good morning. Yes, thank you. One moment. That's in Sch?neberg, right? And what type? Thirty-six. And when did we set it up? Yes. Yes. In that case, I'll stop by first. See you later. Well, did you again go into hiding? - Would you like a coffee? - I was just about to go out. Don't you want to join me? Well, I'm about to write a new chapter in the history of computer programming. The only question is how to make it sacrifice a piece in order to win. Faber, you're still crazy. Come on. You need to get out. - Where do you want to go? - To the vernissage. Nothing special. Someone bought some paintings and invited some people to admire them. There's also something to eat. - Do I need to change? - Yes. You know how to do that. Hello, Horst! Nice to see you. - How are you? - Fine. And you? Thanks. I'm doing well. Hello, Renate. Nice to see you. And on the right hand there's one of the most beautiful patisseries of Paris. - It's also among the oldest. - Yes. Each Saturday there's a market in front of it. And they got some delicious cheeses. And fresh eggs from Normandy. And the entire quartier is starting to look like Chinatown. It's a real shame that they demolished the anicient part. And what about you? Do you still go there frequently. Do you tend to return? Or are you more interested in Berlin now? Excuse me! What? Or are you more interested in Berlin now than Paris? Excuse me! I understand that very well, but it remains your problem. Yes, you have to make a decision. I'm sorry. I'll call you back soon. You're not bothering me. I hope that I'm not bothering you. Yes? I would like to talk to Mr. Lavant. Sixty-seven. You and your telephone. - Do you like the paintings? - I don't understand the pantings. It reminds me of my school days. You know, when I was about ten or twelve years old, we had to paint self-portraits. And I painted myself with green ears. The art teacher thought it was terrible. "A catastrophe!", he said. What was wrong with your ears? Well, in the early past I had sail ears. Do you understand? Like that. - But now your ears are really beautiful. - Yes? - Do you play chess? - Yes. - Are you a good player. - Yes, I'm pretty good. Show me how to play well! White begins. King pawn. I know you master this game. It is said that the contemplative calm of a prison cell is the right place to learn chess. You play for me. I'll get something to drink. A glass of red wine, please. Thank you. Could I have three clean glasses and a bottle of red wine, please? Check! Check! I guess that's it. Ingenious. Yes, that's a famous match. A sacrifice and mate combination, first played by Anderssen in 1852. - I'm not a theorist. - But you play surprisingly well for it. You play very fast. Do you do everything so fast? On the contrary. But have this match in a program I'm testing right now. That's why! - You're working on computers? - Yes. - Exclusively chess? - No. But chess is my hobby. I think I know where the whiskey is hidden. Thank you. What computer generation are you working on right now? The 4th. According to our counting method. Cheers! Do you think the machines developed thus far are already able to surpass humans? The machines are only capable of what we program them for. But their capacity surpasses that of the human brain. So yes. - That means they're faster. - Yes. So in that one aspect they surpass us. I would say they outdo human time. - That's the point. - You already found something to drink. It wasn't that difficult. It's an open house. - I'll bet 10-1. - What? That you won. - You lost? - Mr. Faber won. - And why doesn't anyone know his name? - Because they all call him Melo. And what's his job? What's he living on? Some obscure business. I don't know. He's often at vernissages. Do you know the woman that was with him? I think she's a theatre actress. It was a good idea of yours to take me with you. I should probably do something more often in the evening. From tomorrow on I'll be working at night again. You'll have to go alone. Why don't you stop working as a waitress and do something reasonable? It's too late for me to discuss this. I go to bed. Good night. - Sleep well. - You too. It's not ready yet. The second correction program is currently running. - May I. - Sure. - Have you eaten yet? - No, I'm on a diet right now. I only eat fruit. Baked fruit with dumplings. Bacon. Pork cordon bleu. Devil's sauce. I have the printout ready. - Rice or potatoes. - Is there cordon bleu for today? Yes... Bean salad. Look, that's an input data error. - No, I checked that. - What is it, then? You know how it is. The machine doesn't err. Only humans err. - Well then. - Today is Monday. - Did you sleep well? - More or less. I dreamt badly. Oh, what a surprise! - May I invite you to a cup of coffee? - Yes, please. I'll give you one more chance. Please. - Four. - Five. - And who buys these computers? - Well. That differs. Big companies, insurance agencies, banks. Mainly banks. The loser starts. Zero. - The Berlin discount bank? - Maybe. - Two. And who's that woman you were with the other day? Juliet. Did you like her? I need to call her anyway. Melo told me you repair computers. They can meanwhile do that on their own. I just teach them how to do it. Computers repair themselves? No, but with the support of a special program they can localize the error in their system. They display it. And then one exchanges the damaged part. It's like replacing a dead battery in a tape recorder. Thus you make the program with which the computer controls itself. You understand it faster than Melo. Why is it that one gets to know so little about these things? - Are you really interested? - Yes. In June of 1980 there was an error in the computer of the American air defence center. There was a war that lasted 20 minutes. Not just inside the computer. Airplanes went up. Battle stands of rockets were in a state of alert. For 20 minutes the Third World War program was running. That was in the newspaper. But errors like that occur frequently and one doesn't hear anything about it. Yes. Yes, I wanted to ask if the twelve-volume edition you advertised is still available. And the edition is from 1810? 1830. I see. Well then. Without mold stains. And... Ah, with a supplementary volume. That's interesting. In that case I'd pick them up right away. Yes, I'm nearby. Goodbye! I need to leave for a while. Can you pay for me? - As usual. - Goodbye! Did you bring me something? - Yes. - How much is it? 200. For you. Well, that's kind. - Did you sell well? - Not at all. Don't you know anyone who could buy some of my paintings? You said it was conceivable. Possible. And then it would only be a small step... No, thanks. How do you imagine that? A small step? Hello. But you're priceless. How I imagine it? Maybe you just have to change the direction of your thinking. The aim. - For whom you're doing all that. - What do you mean? That means... Maybe it already crossed your mind that all those streams of time that flow by you every day, the maze of numbers, this mathematics are basically nothing but the movement of money. Yes, it crossed my mind before Yes, it's conceivable. But there are certain boundaries. I'm neither talking in moral nor in legal terms. There are safeguards in place. The access to a certain part of the system is being protected by codes. It works more a less like the number combination of a safe. But it's much safer because it's deep-stacked. Well. The fact remains that it's conceivable, it's possible and it's feasible. - 300. - 100. - And new bets, please. - 200. - 200 Marks at the front table. - I'll bid 100 with it. - 100. 14. And the rest on 7. Here you are. - Bets, please! The new bets. - 200. And that goes with the bank. On 7. 200. - 350. And here you're getting 50 Marks back. - Yes - The new bets, please! - 300. Faber. Great. I'm really glad. Tomorrow evening? No, I got nothing planned. I'm just surprised. Yes. I could pick you up. Yes, at the theatre as well. Where is it? Ah, I see. Yes, I know. Got. See you tomorrow evening. Goodbye! Could I get one more coffee? - Good evening, Victor. - Good evening, Renate. - Good evening. - How are you. - Well. Do you eat here often? Oh, that. Renate is a friend. The lives in the same house as me. I see. Didn't you first want to go here because she works here? - No. Renate doesn't mind. I probably felt a little uncomfortable. What would you like... to eat? And you say you can't make compliments? I would like to see you again. Why would you like to see me again? Because I like to spend time with you. I feel comfortable being with you. I like to look at you. I like to talk to you. Tomorrow I'm going to drive to Paris. - A pity. - It's just for a few days. There's no reason to be sad. I promise to get in touch with you once I return. It's a job just like any other. Perhaps even smoother than many others. I do something and get paid for it. I don't understand your problem. I serve people. And if you enter the restaurant, then I serve you. That doesn't alter our relation. Or did you feel ashamed? No, I just wanted to know how you felt. Did you see her again? No, she had to leave for Paris. Could you carry this upstairs? I'm in a hurry again. - Okay. I'll put it in your kitchen. - Fine. Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. An ongoing, uninterrupted music. A continuous music. A music that changes its matter to its ether. From the cloud to rubber. A fully rubberized everyday life under a sky from which the trombone angels can no longer be chased away. Heavenly legions similar to swarms of flies. Just as supermarket goods stand not only in the light, but also in the music, we are in the music, just like the gas station attendant at the highway, whose fuel pumps are equipped with loudspeakers from which music drips continuously. The modern panacoustic version of Chinese water torture. That means one has to go along. - Hello. - Hello. Wait a second. One moment. Let's go inside. - Do you live here? - No. I'm currently sleeping here. - And apart from that? - At the hotel. With this we will lay the foundation for your new identity. Would you please sit down? You think that's enough? A passport for a new identity? Well, you can also get a driver's license. And if that's not a enough, a pension insurance number. The safest document is an adequately faked passport. All you have to do is move around in a way that only one document is required. - Is that why you alway take the subway? - Maybe. - Someone is coming. - That must be Juliet. - Juliet? - She lives here. - Ah. - Hello. What a surprise! I thought you weren't coming back till tomorrow. Yes, it was terrible. I ran away. I'm glad to be back again. - What are you doing? - Fashion photos. He's crazy. It's nice to see you again. Today I'm going to the casino. Are you coming with me? I'm getting changed. - Faber. - Yes. I know what you're thinking. She's a friend. Nothing more. You're going to need a tie for the casino. Take mine. 4 4 7. 7 7. 7 and 8, please. Zero. - 13 13 15. - 13 13 15. - Here! - Pull it. - 25. - No more bets. 2 2 2. No more bets. 11. Black wins. Why don't you know a system for roulette? There is none. No good one. The bank always wins. Mathematics is boring. One can win. That's for sure. Yes, but one can't forecast it. It's a matter of luck. - I know that today is my lucky day. - Yes. You want to bet I win? No more bets. 21. Red. There's nothing on pass. Give me 20 Marks. It's for the gentleman sitting in the back. 61. Here you are, Sir. 50 again. 557. 98,50. Here you are, Sir. A 200 Marks coupon, please. It's for you, Madam. A 200 Marks coupon. 5000. 506. 1000 Marks, Madam. - 7000 Marks. - 7 12 10. - I congratulate. - You've brought me luck. - You would've also won without me. Maybe. But in that case I wouldn't have stopped. - Not at that moment. - No? - Have you noticed how it's moving? - It's moving? The bridge? It's not moving anymore. I want to stay with you tonight. How much would it be? 2, 3, 4, 5 millions. Once you get inside the system, the sum doesn't really matter anymore. You'll do it? I'm not entirely sure yet. There's an intermediate system. The banks use it amongst each other to make their foreign payments. That's where one should enter. One would have to cause an error in the data processor of that system. A dhort power cut. In that case the banks, or the affected bank, would be forced to approach us. Because we would have to troubleshoot the harware error. And to rebuild the system. And I would be present during the test. I would have to enter some small additional information. And at certain intervals, certains sums would be appear on a solid bank account in Switzerland. And how do you cause that interruption. Well, that's the question. From a technical point of view, it's not that difficult. One needs to deactivate the emergency aggregates. They're like the ones being used for hospitals. One needs to interrupt the power grid. The normal grid. For them to remain without power for a while. Then the programs stop working. You understand? But... One needs to break in. That's not elegant. And it's dangerous. But one has to take a risk in order to win. - Are these Marks or dollars? - Dollars But then one has to disappear. To begin a new life. Are you coming with me? Considering that sum of money. - Franco, one coffee, please. - Yes. It's Melo. Hello. Yeah, I wanted to ask how much longer it'll take with the cardboard. Yes, the money is ready. Yes, I'll soon pass by. Bye. Some days ago I was at a vernissage. They also exhibited something like that. - That's already out of date. - What. - Paintings. - Who was that? - How do you know? - My girlfriend's into that. - Paintings? - Well then, should I bring some coffee? - Yes. With milk. - How did you get inside? - Don't you want to sit down? Usually noone can enter without a batch card. At the very least the porter would've needed to call me. A canteen like this ain't no bank. Right. I brought you something. You can look inside. Wolfgang Bertram. Yes. Put it away. It's for free. My first investment in the joint business. "The Crying Woman". It's being screened. "The Crying Woman". I am the crying woman. It's being screened here in Zurich. In the cinema "North-South". - At a quarter past eleven. - A film? - Yes. - Starring you? - Yes. - Let's watch it. - But I'm crying at lot. - That's nice. Friday Saturday Night screening You'll never bear her feeling so bad. But I want to talk. Can I sit down beside you? Yes. I warn you that I talk a lot. That's all right. - Do you want to drink something? - No. - Do you want a drink. - No, I'll pay it myself. What do you do in life? I'm unemployed. I'm a painter. I paint on paper. I also have a little daughter. I live alone with her. Sometimes I go downhill. You know, it's not easy to take care of both things. A job and a child. And life itself, too. I want to spend the night with you. - Don't you want to? - Yes, of course. But first we have to get a drink. - What should we drink? A beer? - A beer. Could you please bring us a beer and a white wine? After that, we're going to fuck. My mother was a star. In theatre and film. I received a first prize in acting school. I worked a lot. And then, while being on stage one day, I couldn't say my text. From that day on everything went badly. And I just wanted to leave. And... I was told about Germany and especially about Berlin, it being a strange and difficult city. And... - I went there and I... - To Berlin? Yes, I went to Berlin. But... even in Berlin I'm a stranger. The last time I went to Paris, I was at my mother's funeral. A heart attack. - I laughed. - When did you go to the funeral? - You laughed? - Yes. Why? It's stupid. Maybe out of nervousness. But I couldn't behave any other way. How'd it go? It was very easy. One just needs a passport. Can they find out where the money comes from once it's in the account? For the Swiss, it's only sums increasing in a strange rhythm. All instructions are given properly, thus there's no reason for mistrust. In Berlin they'll find out pretty quickly that something is wrong. That's due to the adjustment totals. But it will take them a long while to locate the error. How can one live loitering? One has to keep moving. That all sounds very nice, but basically you live on charity. I don't owe anyone anything. You are provided for because others work. You live off the work of others. - Who doesn't do that? - You have to create your own values. You're not even capable of starting a family. You think of nothing. You believe in nothing. Maybe no one at all wants to create values anymore. Maybe there are other things that matter. What's the point? You relativize everything. You make it very easy for yourself. - Let's talk business, Nino. - Fine. Let's talk business. - Hello. - Hello. - Well, how are you? - Good. - How was your weekend? - Nice. - You don't look very rested. . Do you think so? - But I'm fine. - Yes? - I need to go. Bye! - Bye! - How was Z?rich? - Nice. It's a beautiful city. We saw a beautiful film. Are you nervous? - How much do the two of them know? - Nothing. They only get to know which room you should enter. You need to deactivate the plant yourself. And that's enough for them? They don't want to know anything besides that? It's their job. That's what they are being paid for. There's no room for questions. So what are you afraid of? I don't think it's fear. Rather caution. There are just too many unknowns in the operation. You shouldn't calculate too much. - I didn't know you were so athletic. - Me neither. You always say one has to keep moving. But you are sitting here lazily. Movement is not only something external. I got news. The exact time has been fixed. And now to the top. Okay. Pull it up! Pull it up! Now pull it down. Stay calm, boy. Stay calm. High voltage! Caution! Life hazard! Coupling section. Coupling section. Here! Coupling section. Don't touch anything! I'm going to stand guard. - Here's the fuse box. - A screwdriver! What are you doing there? Freeze! Freeze or I'll shoot! - Fucking shit. - Why the hell did you do that? - Let's get away here! - Damn it! ENTRANCE What's the matter with you? Why did you do that? If he hadn't done it, the guy would have shot us. Let's go! We agreed not to use weapons. - Please stop arguing. - That's murder. Don't you understand? Take the gloves and glasses off. Then walk away slowly. Come on! - Come on. Get going! - All right. It's ok. - The watchman is dead. - Which watchman? At the bank. The nightkeeper. The gangsters had guns. One of them was armed. I didn't know that. And when he came in, they shot him. Come on. Let's go! - Hello. - Hello. I tried to contact you. - I was also looking for you. - You didn't answer the phone. - You also weren't at the company. - That's right. It should've continued as usual. You should've gone to work. Did you read it? Unknown thieves shot a watchman beside a night safe of the Berlin discount bank. But they don't know anything. Nothing at all. You must be really tired. We got it all calculated. By some stupid coincidence he ended the second round earlier and went back to the basement. I don't believe in coincidences. We're either the masters of our life or we're nothing. You and your sayings. Do you want to say that Faber shot the watchman? Nonsense. I don't blame Faber for anything. But that watchman's death is as pointless as anyone else's. And not just pointless, but also unnecessary. You're sending killers with me. We never meant to use weapons. They're blaming you for the mess. And now they're making demands. - What kind of demands? - They want money. - How much? - A lot. More than you got. - What do you want to do now? - Nothing. You're really funny. They blame me for a murder. And you say nothing. We need to do something. We have to go through with what we planned. That's all. - Hello, Faber. - Hello, Renate. - I brought you something from the restaurant. Are you hungry? - Yes. Where's your chess game? Are you working overtime? Yes. A salad. Why that? A salad. Oh, it's still warm. - Well, today is a crazy day. - Why that? Well, I don't know. It's just crazy. Are you drunk? That's your logic. Today I had a guest paying with a 1000 Marks bill. I couldn't exchange it. The bill wasn't even 50 Marks. Then he tipped me with the remaining sum. Yes? That's generous. - Is it a real one? - Yes. I think so. Later,a regular guest gave me a poem. He said: "I actually just write because I don't have the money to get drunk al the time." Sometimes he sits all day long over a coffee and writes. I put him a bottle of cognac today. He drank it all by himself and still wrote. Say, you eat with your fingers. When all the cutlery is dirty,... No, that's too much right now. - Don't you know what time it is? - Are you leaving already? I'm dead tired. Good night. . Wasn't there any call for me? - No. I guess you can't wait. Nothing is going on today. I told you that I would give you a call. Yes? Berlin discount bank? I'll be right over. Well then. The program is running again. That's wonderful. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - It took you quite a while. - I'm not used to practical work anymore. You guys in the software department have a really nice life. You should be assigned to fieldwork more often. - Where to? - Fieldwork. Well then, take a taxi back to the company - What's the matter? What're you up to? - I'm in a hurry. Bye. It's me. Nino's guys followed me. But I got rid of them. Yes, I'm sure of that. They waited in front of the bank. The program is running. It's alright. But it'll take at least five days for the sum to accumulate. I could take a vacation. Or I could call in sick. That's even better. That's good. Why can't we go to Zurich and wait there? They're looking for us everywhere. Sooner or later, there too. And what kind of cabin is that? Very remote in the mountains. Everything we need is in stock there. - Who owns it? - I don't know. A friend of mine has the key. Hello. The passports, please. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Have a pleasant journey. Carnival. Come on. Kiss me. Yes, I'll call. We still have two hours to drive. The rest we have to walk. I like it. Five days up here can be very long. - Tonight it's going to be cold. - No. You won't be cold. I'll try to heat it up. I love you. The sun is shining. Let's take a walk. Where's Faber? He wanted to alone. I heard you tonight. You're out of your mind. Why are you complaining? It was your plan. Yes. I just hope you don't leave suddenly without me. Ah! - Ravioli. - Yes. It's better than nothing. Thank you. These tins make me sick. Why can't we drive somewhere and buy some fresh food? There's nothing against it. We could go out for dinner, too. Down at the village square. Real diner. Or do you think that's too dangerous? Nino won't stop that easily. He's smart. His guys were waiting at the bank. His connections are very extensive. Have you been up here long? Up here one turns into a stone. Lake Constance is within reach. Ein Mann reitet durch die Nacht. It's winter. It's very cold. He must carry a message from Germany to Switzerland. A blizzard breaks loose. He no longer sees a path. And suddenly the landscape becomes very wide. He feels something's changed around him. That sounds hollow. He is astonished, but pushes his horse to even greater haste. All of a sudden, the ground under him gets firmer. He looks back and frightens to death. He's been riding on the ice the whole time. - Well, how are you? - Fine. I think I should really overdraw my old account before we leave. And the car? We've got enough gas to get us to Zurich. I'll sell the car in Zurich. Then we get ourselves a Mercedes as a rental car. And we'll also have some change left for the groceries. What are you gonna do when we get the money, Melo? To go out. I mean, what are you dreaming about? Where do you want to go? Maybe to America. But I still have until tomorrow to decide that. In case case we're going to separate once we're at the airport. As agreed. I'll miss you. - You're getting sentimental? - Is that a problem? It depends. It clouds the perception. You two are weird. Wonderful. That's exactly what I had in mind. Try this on. What do you think about it, Melo? You look as if you had five millions on the account. I actually do. I hope we're not inconveniencing you. But with the dollar fluctuating so much, we didn't have so many banknotes. This is also a high risk for us, if we have such high stocks. My business partner also accepts Swiss francs. I'm sure there won't be any complications. It's taking so long. I'm gonna go check it out. That's the man who takes care of my safety. You can hand him the suitcase. Here you are. Well, thank you for the prompt processing. - I hope we'll continue to do business. - I'm sure of that. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Zurich cantonal bank I'm not flying. I take the bus. Bye! Will you get the tickets? - Where do we go? - It's your choice. Ah, the money. Your change. 30, 50, 900, 7000. Thank you. Here's your ticket. The embarkment is at 0:30 am. Exit gate B 34. Where can I check in the suitcase? Hello, Faber. Did you try to run away? Without sharing with us. You received what had been agreed on. Look. A murder took place. You accompany us to the car and we take care of it. Stay calm. Don't do anything stupid. Stay calm. We've been quite lucky to catch you. The ride's over.
