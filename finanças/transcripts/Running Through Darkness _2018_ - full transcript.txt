Now... I don't think people always get what they deserve. But sometimes, they sure do earn it. Oh, my God. Fuck. Hey... Hey... Hey are you okay? Listen, I'm gonna go get some help. No... Don't get anyone, please. I can't just leave you here. Your place. Please. Who are you? Where am I? Where am I? Get the fuck away from me! I, uh, y-you told me to bring you here. That doesn't mean that I want you anywhere near me. That's for you. It's clean. You were already unconscious. Do you want some more? Your name's Robin, right? We had some classes together at the University. Uh, biology and American literature, I think. My name's Calvin. You told me you didn't want any help. So... I'm really not sure what to do in this situation. Uh, is there somebody you want me to call? Just save it. Save what? This nice guy routine. Bullshit. It's fucking flat. Okay... What will it take for you to get out of my house? Is that the correct time? Yeah. May I use your bathroom? Please. Yeah. Would you like some toast, or an egg, or something? I can spit on that or throw it on the floor but that makes it less nice for you. Coffee, if you have any. Coming right up. So, are you about ready? Look... I appreciate everything you've done for me, but... But if you could go outside looking like that, you would have left already. Look, I've got a car. I can drop you off somewhere. I just can't sit around all day waiting for the sun to go down. Did you happen to see a purse laying nearby, where you found me? I didn't notice anything. I was pretty caught off guard. I... thought you were dead. Mmm, Karl won't. Huh? Nothing. Listen, can I just enjoy my coffee? Yeah. Yeah, uh... I'm just gonna go take a shower. Hi. Calvin Jacobs! Calvin Jacobs. Nice to meet you. Hi. Nice to meet you. - Good to meet you. - Calvin Jacobs. It's great to meet you. Hi. Calvin Jacobs. Mr. Jacobs. They'll see you now. I already found it. Geez. I found it the other day. Thanks for looking. Yeah... I haven't been back this way since. I know. I've been waiting. You've been waiting here for three days? No. I've been waiting for you be out of your house and alone for three days. Can we go somewhere and talk? So what's up? I need your help. Yeah. Sure. Anything. I need you to kill someone. What's the joke? No joke. I need your help. I need you to kill someone. No, no, no, no, no... No. I can't do that. I won't do that. Please. There's not enough magic in that word to make it work in this situation. There's no way. Why? Because you're the only one I can trust. We don't even know each other. That didn't stop you from helping me the other day. That was different. You were dying. I was helping you to live. This is... This is the exact opposite. I can't believe we're even having this conversation. Do you remember how you found me the other morning? Of course. Bruised. Bloody. Beaten. Violated in ways you couldn't possibly understand. Left to die for no real reason. While the person responsible walks around free to do it again. I know he didn't survive all that just to live in fear of every shadow in the daylight. I'm not the first, but I definitely want to be the last. Then just... just go to the cops. Cops don't exist in this world. Yeah, until they come knocking on my door. The only reason they would ever knock on your door would be to give you a medal for taking out the trash. Besides, that's why you're perfect. There's nothing connecting you. As long as you don't leave any evidence... there's no motive and nothing to lead back to you. I don't like this. Tell me more about the guy. His name is Karl Screase and he is every bit as dangerous as he looks. I would suggest that you avoid him for as long as possible. The last place you want to be is on his radar. He's not an early bird, but once he's up, he's constantly on the move. Checking in on his various operations all over the city. The thing you have to understand about Karl is that everything is always on his terms. He thrives on control and requires vengeance. It's like everything on the planet is in his way. No matter what, he always winds up at his bar. It's his front. His den. Shit. Good book? Yeah. Yeah? It must be difficult to see me through all these pages... There... now there's nothing between us. I guess I'll see you around. What?! Uh... Is Robin here? Rob! You have company. Just come on in and have a seat. I'll be out in a second. So what'd you find out? Uhhhh... your roommate... isn't wearing any clothes. It's her place. She can do whatever she wants. Including hear you in the next room. Forget about her. How'd it go today? I don't think it's gonna work out. What? Why not? Are you sure we should be talking about this here? Why do you think she's staying here genius? Are you gonna kill this fucker, or what? Hey, it's not that simple. Actually... it just became a lot more complicated. What? Why? How? He confronted me. Are you fucking kidding me? He follows him around for one day and gets made. What the fuck is that? Can you stay out of this? Or put some clothes on? Or both! What?! Izzy... please. This is bullshit! How bad was the confrontation? He ripped up my book. Told me he'd be seeing me. Was anyone else there? I mean we were on the sidewalk, but... I guess no one was around. Well, it's not as bad as all that. How do you mean? Well... Karl's not the kind of guy to post his problems online. He'll take care of them on his own. Oh, that's great! No, it is... see he's the only one that knows that you and he have a connection. He doesn't take photos. He doesn't write stuff down. He doesn't share things with anyone. You can still do this and walk away. I really think you've got the wrong guy. Why don't you just take off? Because he's unrelenting. He may not look it. It's part of his cover, but he is very resourceful and very well-connected. If I run, I'll always be running. That's no way to live. I'm sorry. We'll see how you feel after your first visit from him. Get in! I'm okay. Thanks! It wasn't a suggestion. Where are we going? Doesn't that make you feel good? What? That family. It's okay. I want you to look. Don't make me make you. You mean that mother and son? That kid... has his whole life ahead of him. Endless opportunities. Endless possibilities. It all comes down to the decisions he makes. And how his parents raise him. I mean if they do a good job... sky's the limit. But if they do a shit job, well... he'll probably find himself in a situation he'd rather not be in... but... more than likely... it'll become a trend. Where's Robin? Who? That was a bad decision. Now... where's Robin? I can smell her on you. I can see her in your eyes. Open the glove compartment. That... is the only way you're getting out of here. Pick it up. Weighing your options? Well, if it will help you make a good decision... I'll help you out. Now I just said... "that is the only way you're getting out of here." So unless you want this to be where your story ends... Pick up the fucking gun. Feels good, right? Heavy. Like it could do some real damage, even if it wasn't loaded. Point it at me. At me! Now... Pull the trigger. What? Pull... the... trigger. If you shoot me in the hip... I'm liable to get real angry and strangle you before you can get out of the car. Here. Right here. In the chest. Go on. Weighing your options again, huh? See – I already know where she is and I'm going to get her. The only way to stop me, is for you to get me – right now. Please. You want me to beg? Alright, fine. Please. Pretty please – pull the fucking trigger. Here, I'll make it even easier for you. How about that? Don't look at them. They're not gonna help you, kid. How about this? Does this help you? How about now? Does that make it any easier for you? Tell you what... Why don't I count us down? You feel free to pull the trigger at any time. Five... Ooooohhhhhhhh...... Whew. Well... how about that? You didn't even let me get to three. Thought for sure you were gonna pull on two. I'll take that. See, this is my fun gun. It's an exact replica. Couldn't even fire if it were loaded. What the fuck is the matter with you? First ones the hardest kid. We're past that now. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you... killing Robin. Or I'm gonna kill you. Now get the fuck out. Hey... So, I just got my first visit from Karl. Oh, my God. Where are you? Headed over to your place. No. Meet me at the parking garage at 10th & Q in fifteen minutes. Wait, but– Shit! Head to the roof. So he wants you to kill me. Thanks for the heads up. I'm not gonna do it. Calvin, Karl will kill you. It'll be just another day to him. Even if you do kill me, he'll still kill you to tie up loose ends. You're better off just killing him yourself. This is so ridiculous! Jeez, all I did was try to help you. And now I'm caught in this... ...bizarre kill triangle. Why do you two want each other dead so bad? He wants me dead, because I want to leave. And I want him dead so I can leave. That's not good enough. There's something you're not telling me. He's a human trafficker. In every sense of the word. Sex, organs, labor, eggs... you name it, Karl can handle it. He recruits out at the bar, the University... Those properties you followed him to – each one is a division of his business. So there are people in those houses? He doesn't keep anyone in town. There's a whole network that takes care of the people. The places in town either have chiefs that oversee that particular operation, or storage. Storage? Deep freezes, mostly. And your role in all of this? I've had so many over the course of our relationship... Let's just say – I got high enough in the organization to see him really enjoy his work. Beating people up. No! Fucking dissecting them! Will you put on your big-boy pants and kill this fucker? Before you wind up on an inventory list and in several freezer bags all over town. No. No. I've got another idea. Whatever it is, it won't work. Dear Killer, I hope you heard me the other day. This is in case I wasn't absolutely clear. –K So what is it? Coffee table. I take it this is just another day for you. Calvin, I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. Sorry I went running that morning. Sorry I went back to check on you. Sorry I didn't charge my phone the night before. He's just trying to intimidate you. This is well past intimidation. Rapidly approaching terrorism. What am I even supposed to do with it? He's a total fucking psychopath, isn't he? No, he like what Psychopaths aspire to be... like the fucking Michael Jordan of insanity. We can just burn it. You have a fireplace. I don't even want to think about that, much less have a memory of it. Do you know who dropped it off? I didn't catch his name. No, I mean did you see him? I probably know who it is. What difference does that make? We could bring it back. Great idea... "Return to sender." Then they can fucking set me up with another pair. I'll just– I'll just bury it in the backyard. I'm telling you, we should burn it. It's evidence and we don't know who they belong– Shhhh... Someone could be listening. Sorry. I can only imagine the smell. It'll go quick and then we can fill in the hole. There's a box of matches in the kitchen. Top of the fridge. Can you grab them? Sure. Do you have any kind of weapon? Besides a steak knife. No. Why? This is only gonna get worse. I shouldn't have got you involved. You know there's only one of two ways out of this, right? And if I do kill him... What's to stop his guys from coming after me? I told you... He doesn't share his personal business with anyone. The less they know the easier it is for everyone. Is that why you know so much? To make it harder for everyone. I told you I was sorry. What about the guy who dropped this off? Trust me. No one is going to avenge Karl. They're all monsters. If you cut off one of their heads they'll just grow another and move on. Jesus Christ! How can you be such a pussy? I never understood why that was an insult. I always thought they were pretty tough. I mean... ...pussies can take quite a bit of punishment still remain functional. Hmph! If that's you plan, then good fucking luck. Hi, you've reached Jacobs. We're not available at the moment. But if you leave your name, number and a brief message. We'll return your call as soon as possible. Thank you. Hey, mom and dad. I just wanted to give a quick call. I'm just sitting downtown... had a few minutes to kill. I, uhh– Talk to you soon. Love you both. We Need to talk. I'm not gonna do it. And you're not going to either. We're all just gonna walk away. Look... She knows things. And now I know things. And if you come around either of us again... other people are gonna know them, too. I hope I'm being clear. One thousand. Oh, hey Killer. I, uh– didn't see you there. You shoulda said something. Did you, uh, take care of that thing... we talked about? No. No, look... I came here to tell you that I'm not going to... and you're not going to either. Listen. She told me what you're into and I'm not afraid. If you come near either of us again I'm going straight to the police. That's assuming you're able to... after I... come around. Listen to me. Leave us the fuck alone. Stay the fuck away from us. You be careful with that knife killer. You're liable to do someone a favor. Hey! I'll tell you what, you seem like a sporting man. Why don't I play you for it? You lose... I win. If I win... you lose. Sound good? You know, this this is much easier and much safer if you don't struggle. Good. Now. lay your hand out... fingers spread wide. Relax... I'm a professional. Oooh... You see... most people stop when they draw blood. Not me. I see that as a challenge to try harder and I usually speed up. WOOOO! Good game! Now. You were saying something about knowing things... and being left alone. Well... I think that's a fine idea. Fuck. C'mon. Think. UGH! FUCK! Hello? Mr. Jacobs? Speaking. Hi! This is Todd Wilkinson. We met last week for your interview for– Oh, yes! Hi. How are you? I'm alright. I was calling to let you know that we're moving on to our final round of interviews and we'd really like for you to come in and talk with us again. Yeah! Absolutely. Super! How does Friday morning sound? Say 10 o'clock. That sounds great. All right. See you then. Awesome. Thank you! Run as fast as you want. You'll never escape your mother's reach. Dad! What happened to your hand? Oh, it's nothing. Just an accident. What are you doing here? Your mother sent me up here to check on you. Make sure you doing all right. Get in. I'll give you a lift back to your place. Well, if you dumb enough to stick your hand in the blender without unplugging it first... you deserve to get cut up. I know. It was stupid. Just don't tell mom, okay? She'll probably yell at me for not teaching you better. Just don't let it happen again. Alright? Can I get you anything to drink? Water'll be fine. So how's life been treating you? I wish I had something clever to say. I bet it's been quiet since your roommates moved out. Yeah. I guess so. So what's your next move? I honestly don't know. Um, I got a callback for that job I applied for. I guess I'll go ahead and prepare for that. Do you want the job? What do you mean? I mean does it excite you? Do you look forward to the idea of doing it day in and day out? Is it what you want? I guess I hadn't thought about it like that. I just met a bunch of the qualifications and applied for it. I thought that was how it worked. Calvin... are you sure you didn't stick your head in the blender also? Why do you say that? Son... do you know what the most valuable thing in the known universe is? Uhh– I'll give you a hint. It's not gold. It's not jewels. It's not land. And it damn sure isn't power. It's time. Time is the most valuable thing in existence. Because we all get so much of it. Everything can be earned if you really want it. But you can never get more time. Some people squander it. Piss it away on drugs. Some people get it cut short before they even know what they have. Most people, huh... Most people just invest in the wrong things. Think it's gonna get them happiness. What you spend your time on... better count for something when it's all said and done. What about you? Me? I wanted to be with your mother. I wanted to spend time with her. Make her happy. That meant starting a family. The point is you have to start moving down your own path. You went to school and your mother and I appreciate that... but you're an adult. Now is your time. Don't settle. Just because something is easy, doesn't mean it's worthwhile. And it sure in the Hell doesn't mean it's gonna last. It's just as easy to say 'hello' as it is to say 'goodbye.' The Hawaiians figured that out a long time ago. You gotta stop putting your hand where it doesn't belong... and focus on finding what it was meant for. And son... That takes time. Just don't waste it. Okay? Yes, sir. Alright. Hello? Hey... I'm outside. Meet me at the door. It's done. What? Karl... It's done. What? When? How? Last night. Came down to him or me. You're really serious. Yeah. Thank you. Well, you look calmer. So what's next? I don't know. Uh... I've got a job interview this Friday. That's great. I don't know if I'm going to go through with it. What are your other options? I don't know. I thought about maybe traveling. You know... Never really done that. Just hit the road. See where it goes. Isn't that what you do when you go running? No.That's like being a hamster on a wheel. It's just exercise. Thoughtless routine. Except for the day you found me. Yeah, you definitely through off the monotony. That's for sure. Come with me. Where? Anywhere. Everywhere. That's the orgasm talking. It'll wear off. No. I'm serious. I mean... Who else can we talk to about what we've been through? I don't think we should talk to anyone about what we've been through. Right. Of course, but– You know what I mean. This has been... a life-changing experience. For me, at least... and now that you're free to move about... I think you should do it... with somebody you can trust. Oh, my God! Don't tell me he's fucking proposing. Hey Izzy. Well, it's, uhh, four in the morning. What's the Cub Scout doing here? He just stopped by to tell us that our little problem has been solved. Yeah. Right. I'll believe that when I see it. I'm going to bed Uh, looks like I missed the celebration. Sorry Izzy! Next time change sheets when you're done. She does bring up a good point. What? About hygiene? No. About believing it when I see it. What actually happen between you and Karl? What? You want a play-by-play? Just give me the highlights. Okay, uhh... I went to his bar. He did this to me. Threw me in a trunk. Took me to a house to do God knows what. The second the trunk opened I kicked him in the face, knocked him out. There was this big chest freezer in the corner. I think he was going to try to stuff me in there, so I beat him to it. Locked him in and left. That's it? What more do you want? Jesus Christ! He could've gotten out. No. There's a padlock on the thing. I locked him in. Did you take his phone? What? No. Why? Because he could have called somebody to come and let him out. No... He was unconscious. Also, he couldn't have lasted more than like 15 minutes in there. Did you wait around to make sure? No. Jesus Christ! We've got to go there and make sure he's dead. I really think you're overreacting. I'm telling you. He's dead. Even if he did get ahold of somebody, they wouldn't have gotten there in time. Which house was it? I'm not gonna tell you that. You are such an asshole. I just don't think we should go picking at scabs here. I'm gonna go. Damnit. Fuck. Hey! What's your hurry? What the Hell? Someone call the police! Shit! What the fuck are you doing man? You ran into my fucking car. You piece of shit. Oh, my God! Goddamnit! Hey... Are you okay? Thanks for asking. I had a bit of a chill earlier. But things are starting to warm up. Where's Robin? Oh... She's around. Where are you? You know where I am dickhead! You think I'm gonna hide from you? Fuck! Didn't know you were a backdoor man, Killer. If I had... woulda left the light on for ya. You like music? You must. All kids like music. They just don't write'em like this anymore. Oh, you're hurt. Tell me where it hurts. I'll see what I can do for ya. Fuck you, psycho! Interesting approach. I hear what you're saying, really... I do. But you know what? We may have other options left. Like this. Or maybe a little higher. We're getting very close. I can feel it. Shhhhhhhhhh.... I know it's been rough. All the tests so far have been inconclusive. But there is one option left. I'm afraid we're going to have to operate. AAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!! You got a quarter? That's alright. I'll go play the slot machine. I think your friend is in some real pain there Rob. Perhaps we should put him out of his misery. Hmm? I mean, after all... we are responsible. Or... how about this? Huh? I mean, after all... his misery is our misery. These... wretched lives we live. Preying on the helpless... hopeless... heartless... naive. I can't help wonder... what made you think any of this... was a good idea? Bullet for your thoughts? Fuck you. I'm sorry. I didn't catch that. Fuck you. Hang on a sec. FUCK YOU! Intriguing. It's hardly the time, but... since you insist. AAAHHHHH!!! Isn't it funny that we're ending the same way we started? I don't think people always get what they deserve, but sometimes they sure do earn it. AAHHH! Fucking bitch! Are you okay? We should get out of here. What are you doing? Tying up loose ends. Sorry Calvin. Hey, hold on, wait a minute. I'm tired of waiting. I'm tired of wasting. Robin, you don't want to do this. No, Calvin. This is exactly what I want to do. With the two of you here they won't look any further. It'll just be an open-and-shut case of bad timing and worse luck. We can figure out another way. There is no other way. This was always a dead end. If you were smarter, you would've seen it coming. Robin, if you pull the trigger, things can never be the same. I know. I'm sorry. It's a replica. See? I'm sorry. Mr. Jacobs... Thank you for coming. Oh, are you– are you okay? Yeah. It's nothing. Okay. Well, come with me then. I got hit by a car while running the other day. Was it a "hit and run"? Sorry. Bad joke. I was trying to lighten the mood. Oh... I thought you're being literal. Well, I was just trying to– Never mind. Let's just move on with the interview. So since we last met I've had the opportunity to go over your material. You've done some very respectable work. Your numbers are solid. So let me ask you this... What would you say is your greatest strength? Um... I guess... I don't know. You don't know? No, uh... Honesty? Modesty, maybe. How about your greatest weakness? A pretty face. What do you like to do for fun, outside of work? Uh, I like to run. Read. Play music. What do you like to read? Anything really. As long as it's well-written. Sci-fi. The classics. Been thinking about getting into true crime. How do you deal with pressure, or stressful situations? A lot differently than I used to. Incrementally. Moment to moment. Can you elaborate on that? No. Okay. Describe a difficult situation and what you had to do to overcome it. Um.. Can we come back to that one? Sure. If you could be any animal, what would you be? A rat. A rat? Or a roach. Why's that? Well, a roach can survive an atomic blast and if you throw a rat into water it will still be treading 24 hours later. I see. Where do you see yourself in five years? Mr. Jacobs? Mr.Jacobs?! Not here. That's it? You want some more?
