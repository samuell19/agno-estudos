[suspenseful music] [gasping] [yells] She said it would be the best summer ever, and it was. I wanted it to last for the rest of our lives. As much as I hate what she did to me, I will always love her. [suspenseful music] Hi, Vivian, hi! MAN: Good morning, Mrs. Conrad. Hi, Brent. Hi. Hi, Felicia. [whistle blowing] [cheering] Keep it going. There you go. There you go. Keep going. You can do it, Lauren! Bring it in, sweetheart. Yes, honey! [whistle blowing] [cheering] ANNOUNCER: The winner in the junior girls' freestyle is Lauren Conrad. Congratulations! Did you see my mom? Did you see me win? Of course, I did, darling. And that's the first medal of the summer. Come on, Lauren. Let's look at your medal. Congratulations. Thanks. [chatter] You must be very proud of your swimmers, today. You really whipped them into shape. It's so early in the summer. Thanks, Mrs. Conrad. Matt, we've known each other for years. Don't you think it's time you call me Vivian? OK, sure. ANNOUNCER: Your attention, please. Next Wednesday the 14th-- Hey, how about a picture of the winner? Matt, we need the coach, too. Come on, guys, smile. Say, Matt, we're going to throw some steaks on the grill tonight. One more wouldn't be any trouble. Well, I-- I don't know. LAUREN: Come on, Matt. Please, come? OK, sure, yeah, sounds like fun. Yay! Good. Justin will be glad, too. We have so much to catch up on. Thank you, Mrs.-- Vivian. Dinner is at 7:30. OK. So are you off the clock yet? Uh, n-- no, I still got to punch out. Are you coming to the party at the Winstead's this weekend? Of course, he's coming. My man, Matt, would never miss a big blowout. Would you, Matt? [sighs] Actually, I got some stuff I need to do. Oh, well, I hope that you can make it. Uh, I think we'd have a pretty good time. Bye, Matt. I'll see you, Alec. You bet. What is the matter? Diane's really hot for you. What do you need? A tour guide? An engraved invitation? A note from your mother? Is that all you think about is sex? Yeah. Look, face it, man. Sooner or later, you've got to do it with somebody. Well, maybe that someone hasn't come along. Look, Diane is a sure thing! Go for it! Look, when it happens, it'll happen. Yeah, but at the rate you're going, you'll probably collect Social Security first. Come on. [doorbell ringing] Oh, I'll get it, Mrs. Conrad. No, no, I'll get it, Maggie. You finish the salad. Hi. Hi. Um, I hope I'm not too early. No, not at all. Come in. Would you like a drink? Yeah, yeah, a beer would be great. Lauren's going to be so excited you're here. She's right outside. Looks like you survived your freshman year. How are your grades? Uh, Dean's list both semesters. Congratulations. I do hope, though, that you managed to do something more than study. Uh, not really. It's what summer vacations are for. Are you still diving? Um, not as much as I used to when I was competing. The pool at school is really always crowded. Hey, Matt. Hey, squirt. VIVIAN CONRAD: Lauren has not taken off that medal since we got home. Wow! LAUREN: Do you like it? MATT TEMPLETON: Yeah, that's great. I got a new video game. Do you want to go upstairs and play it? Oh, maybe some other time, sweetheart. But right now, Maggie could use your help in the kitchen. OK. All right, I'll see you later, squirt, OK? See you later, Matt. I think somebody's got a crush on you. [chuckles awkwardly] She's a great kid. I don't know where Justin is. He was supposed to be home an hour ago. Matt, how do you feel about starting the fire? No problem. OK. So how late does Mr. Conrad usually work? Depends. I stopped trying to keep up with Justin's schedules. [door closing] Speak of the devil. Well, company for dinner. Any calls? No. Uh. Nice to see you, Matt. How is school? - It was great, Mr. Conrad. - Good. - Daddy! - Uh-huh. Look what I won! Whoa! Look at that thing! Congratulations, sweetie! Look, I'm sorry I wasn't there. That's OK, dad. No, no, I'll be there next time. I promise. LAUREN: Really? JUSTIN CONRAD: Really. VIVIAN CONRAD: Of course, he will. Matt, would you excuse me a minute? I'm going to go get out of this suit, all right? Sure, I'm in no hurry, sir. Here, come on. Grab that. Yeah, take your time. JUSTIN CONRAD: All right. [music playing] So have you thought about what you want to do after you graduate? No, sir, not really. Mm. Justin, maybe Matt would like to learn about your securities business while he's home. Yeah, good idea. Would that interest you, Matt? Yeah, that would be great, but I know how busy you are. No, I'm sure we can work something out. [phone ringing] Excuse me. Yeah. Yeah, hold on. This is Bailey from the office. This could take a while. Why don't you two finish without me? Sorry. Yeah. Well, what do they counter with? You're kidding. No, that's unacceptable from our standpoint, you know that. When did they say they'd call again? Who? Yamasura? But don't you have a connection inside his office? Are you listening to me? Oh, no, I can't do it on Thursday. I-- I have a lesson to go to. Well, then change-- VIVIAN CONRAD: It's been very nice having you here this evening, Matt. [sensual music] Bill, you're not listening. Hey, that's your job, not mine, all right? Bill, I want you to go talk to him. I'll be by tomorrow. Thanks. Look, I think I should go. JUSTIN CONRAD: I want this cleared up by lunch tomorrow. Thanks for a really nice evening. JUSTIN CONRAD: I said lunchtime. Would you tell Mr. Conrad I said goodbye? [chuckles] [children chattering] I'll get the rest of my bags out of the car. What-- what is he doing here? Your father decided it's time for him to come back home. [scoffs] Mom, you've got to be kidding? Matt, he's been sober for six months now. Says who? Is that what he told you? Mom, I can't believe you're giving in to him after what he did to you. He can't afford to rent his own apartment and pay the mortgage on this house anymore. Well, he should have thought about that before he moved out. Hi, Matt. Son, I want to put the past behind us. I'm sure you do. What did you say? Nothing. No, what did you say? Nothing. Look, whether you like it or not, I'm moving back in. I don't need your permission. ANNOUNCER: Mr. Green and party to the first tee, please. Mr. Green and party to the first tee. And when you're done with those towels, my car could use a wash and wax. Don't hold your breath. A little testy. [sighs] Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. My old man moved back in. Oh, that's a drag. Yeah, I knew he couldn't leave us alone. I-- I knew he'd worm his way back in somehow. You never know, man. Maybe he's changed. [scoffs] Changed? My old man? He'll never change. Yeah, well, father or no father, you're coming to the party tonight whether you want to or not. I won't let you pull your little shy act again this summer. Do I have to wear a tux? Yep, but don't worry, I got you covered. I'm warning you, man. You better watch out. You might just have a little bit of fun tonight. Mwah Catch. Mwah. Hey! [reggae music] (SINGING) Paradise nights. Mr. Paradise Nights. Paradise nights. Mr. Paradise Nights. Give us a look, come on. [sighs] And you know you're almost presentable. Do we have to do this? Yes, you do. [sighs] Let's go. [chatter] WOMAN: Hello! Hi! Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. You look wonderful. Thanks, so do you. Where's Justin tonight? Chicago on business. Oh, poor baby's all alone. [chuckles] Yes, all alone. [laughs] [sighs] I have to go be a wife. All right. I'll catch up with you in a minute. OK. Hi, Vivian. HI. You look wonderful. I'm interested to hear all about. It's about 150-- Well, well, well. Justin's out of town, I take it. [chuckles awkwardly] Whatever gave that idea, Frank? Oh, just a lucky guess. Uh, uh, exactly what do you think you're doing? Merely, my dear, taking advantage of a perfect situation. But thanks, but no thanks, Frank. Got one like you at home. [chuckles] Yes, OK. Well, that's-- [applause] He looks like he could use some company. I think I'll go talk to him. Vivian, you are absolutely shameless. [chuckles] How do I look? [reggae music] Irresistible. (SINGING) Human eyes. The Earth and now. Human eyes. The Earth. Human eyes. The Earth and now. Mind if I join you? No. No, not at all. Are you having a good time? I guess so. [chuckles] You don't sound so sure. I-- I feel sort of out of place here. Why is that? A lot of these people used to be, um, friends of my parents before-- before my dad's business went under. I never really know what to say to them. Well, you seemed just fine when you're at the club. People treat you differently when you work for them. Oh, Matt. Don't let any of these people make you feel uncomfortable, not for a minute, believe me. They are just not worth it. It's easy for you to say. Not really. It used to bother me, too, at first. You seem so relaxed. It's probably because I just got to learn how to play their games, that's all. I'm from a small town, Matt. I'm a preacher's daughter. I didn't grow up with all these people. [laughter] (SINGING) Human eyes. The Earth and now. Lauren and I got a little surprise for you this afternoon. Really? Uh-huh. I mean, just a little something to say thank you for all the time you spent coaching her. Let's get out of here. Why don't you put on something more comfortable and drop by my house and pick up your present? And here's a little something extra for staying late tonight. Oh, you didn't have to do that, Mrs. Conrad. No, really, I want to. Please, Maggie, take it. I feel bad about keeping you away from your family on a Saturday night. MAGGIE: Well, thank you very much. VIVIAN CONRAD: Oh, you're welcome. Goodnight. [electronic whirring] [sensual music] Where is everybody? Lauren's upstairs asleep. She's going to be very upset she missed seeing you. And Justin's out of town. So when is Mr. Conrad getting back? I haven't the faintest idea. I'd like to propose a toast. To the best summer ever. To the best summer ever. Here, open it up. I think you're going to love it. Well, aren't you going to try it on? Where? What's wrong with right here? Matt, I see you in much less than that at the pool. It's just a shirt. Slip it on. OK. I better go. I wish you wouldn't. Matt. I shouldn't even be here. Th-- thanks for the shirt. Matt? I'd really like you to stay. I can't do this. Well, you can trust me. I-- I haven't been with that many girls before. [sensual music] I'm a very good teacher. [sensual music] Is everything OK? Yes, Lauren's sound asleep. Can I ask you something? Of course. Did, um-- [chuckles awkwardly] was-- was that good? [chuckles] Terrific. Really? (CHUCKLING) Mm-hmm. Really. The truth is, um, tonight was my first time. I-- I just feel like I should tell you that. I-- I don't know why. I-- I just thought you should know. That's very special, Matt. I'm quite flattered. Does that mean I can see you again? The best summer ever, remember? But you do have to promise me one thing. Anything. While this can be as wonderful a summer as you want it to be, as long as we keep this just between you and me. But what about Mr. Conrad? I thought I told you to let me worry about Justin. I know, I know, but what if-- Matt, you have got to tell me and promise me that you will not say one word about this to anyone. Promise? I promise. [moans] [sensual music] [door closing] [chatter] What are you looking at? [chuckles] The look on your face says it all. Nothing serious, Jackie. You know that. [chuckles] Yes, but the question is, does he? He's adorable, isn't he? There's just this innocence about him that I find fascinating. [laughs] Well, if you can tear yourself away from Mr. Fascinating, our court is ready. SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): The bottom of the fifth inning. [phone ringing] MATT TEMPLETON: I got it. SPORTSCASTER (ON TV): The prospects look good in the fourth when the bases were loaded. [phone ringing] --struck out by Corvales, leaving everything up in the air. CHARLES TEMPLETON: Hello? VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): Charles. CHARLES TEMPLETON: Hi, Vivian. VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): It's been a long time. Yes, it-- it has been a long time. VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): Is Matt home? Matt? Yes, he's-- he's here. VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): May I speak to him? Just a minute. Hello? VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): I hope it's all right that I called. Of course. I was beginning to wonder if you'd forgotten about me. VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): After the evening we spent together, how could I? Where are you? VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): Look out your front window. So want to play a little tennis for a while? I'll be right out. So I take it we're not going to play tennis? Would you like to play tennis? I have been wanting to do this all day long. [upbeat music] MATT TEMPLETON: I'd say you have been officially stood up. ALEC: Man, she'll show. I'm telling you, this girl really digs me. Whoa! Inspiration has arrived. Viv, I have a little surprise for you. I've rented a house at the beach for us. A whole week of nothing but sea and sun, just and me, hm? Justin, that's wonderful. I called your folks. They'd be happy to take Lauren for the week. This is what you wanted, isn't it? Of course, we haven't been away together in a long time. Hey, Matt. Matt! Uh, Matt, what do you want to drink? You drinking anything? Uh, nothing. Excuse me, for a minute, will you? [chatter] Well, hello there. What are you doing here? I might ask you the same question. The girl you're with is pretty. Yeah. Y-- yeah. Alec keeps trying to set me up with her. I-- I got stuck. No, no, really, I-- I-- there was nothing I could do about it. Matt, I'm just teasing you. Oh, right. I tried calling you this afternoon. That's funny. Maggie didn't say there were any messages. Messages? I'm not crazy. I didn't leave any messages. I've been thinking about you all day. Really? When can I see you again? I'm free tomorrow. I'll arrange for Maggie to take Lauren someplace. And we can spend part of the day together. That would be great. Whoa, little jumpy, aren't we? I-- I, uh-- Hello, Matt. Hi, Mr. Conrad. I-- I was just telling, uh, Mrs. Conrad that I-- I've been meaning to drop by the office and-- and see you. I-- I've been really busy. Any time. Any time at all, Matt. Well, thanks. Uh, just a minute. Lauren won't be at swim practice this week. Viv and I are going to be going out of town, so, uh, Lauren will be staying with her grandparents. Is that a problem? No. No, sir, not at all. Good. Always nice to see you, Matt. [chatter] They're all out. I can't believe you're going away with him for that long. Matt, it's only a week. Yeah, but the summer is short enough as it is, Vivian. School's starting soon. Oh, Matt, look, don't do this to me. Justin planned this trip. He just dropped it on me out of the blue. What was I supposed to do? You're going to miss me? Of course, I'm going to miss you. You're going to miss me? Let me show you how much. [water splashing] [sensual music] [birds chirping] [clock chiming] Your mother was worried half out of her mind when you didn't come home last night. I told her I'd be late. This isn't late, Matt. It's dawn. Where the hell have you been anyway? None of your business. Matt. As long as you're living under this roof, everything you do is my business. Look, I just want to make sure you're not doing something you'll be sorry for later. Get real. You don't care about me. You don't care about mom, either. And the only reason why you're back in this house is because you're flat broke. There's the dad I know. [seagulls squawking] [sensual music] Let's go inside. [moans] Look, I hate to do this, but I have to fly back to Chicago tonight. The Cramer deal's falling apart. Why didn't you tell me this earlier? [sighs] Because I didn't want to disappoint you. Oh. This is so typical of you, Justin. You say you want us to be alone together, then you just run off on business the first time the phone rings. Business is what pays for vacations like this. Business puts a roof over your head and a tennis racket in your hand. I'm sorry you find my business so offensive. How long are you going to be gone? [sighs] Well, if I'm lucky, only a day or two. And I'll probably have to go straight back to the office when I return. Look, I'm sorry. I better go pack. [phone ringing] Hello? Hi, I'm glad it's you. MATT TEMPLETON (ON PHONE): Hey, how are you? I'm fine, but I miss you. Are you where you can talk? Uh, sort of. What's up? Well, Justin had to leave on business today. I can leave right now. Mm, why don't you come down tomorrow. But you call me just as soon as you get to town, OK? I'll give you the number. OK. See you tomorrow. Who was that, honey? Uh, Tommy Ferguson. Oh, your old roommate. Yeah, yeah. Um, he wants me to come up to his parent's cabin. A bunch of friends are there from school. When? Tomorrow. I can be there before lunch. What about work? I'll get somebody to replace me. [uplifting music] VIVIAN CONRAD: You did it! Oh, it looks great! Yes! Come on! Let me hold it. Oh! [chuckles] You still have the kite? I still have the kite. Do I have to hold this kite now? Yes. I might not. I might let go. You better. [chuckles] OK, I'll hold it. [sensual music] [sighs] I wish the wind could pick us up like that and never bring us back. Yeah, Mom, hi. I just wanted you to know, uh, I got here safe and sound. OK, I'll be home in a couple of days. OK, bye. That was so sweet. I don't like my mom to worry. Well, all mothers worry about their children. Yeah, well, this is different. It is? How is this different? I-- I did something a while back that really scared her a lot. Mm, that sounds like it must have been pretty serious. It was serious. Well, do you want to tell me about it? I don't think I really want to talk about it right now. I hope you know that you can tell me anything. And it's never going to change the way I feel about you. [somber music] I tried to kill myself. Why? To get away from my dad. What did he do to you? It started when I was about six. He used to slap me with his hand. That wasn't so bad. But when that didn't work, he used to whip me with a belt, a thick, black, leather belt. Anything would set him off. If I-- if I didn't win a swim meet. If-- if I didn't bring home straight A's in my report card. Oh, Matt. He would just grin at me. And then he'd snap that belt. I can still hear it. Did your mother ever try to stop it? She'd try. But he'd just slap her down and keep coming at me. When did it stop? [scoffs] Stop? It never stopped. There were times when he beat me so hard, I thought he was going to kill me. That's-- that's why I decided to kill myself and save him the trouble. But my mom walked in on me. [sensual music] [phone ringing] Hello? Oh, hi. Just taking a nap. How did your meetings go? Well, I don't know, Justin. Uh, I'll be home in a day or two. I miss you, too. Yeah, that's good. We'll just-- we'll see what happens. Yeah, I am. I'm-- I'm sleepy. [chuckles] I love you, too. [seagulls squawking] VIVIAN CONRAD: Are you OK? MATT TEMPLETON: I don't want to go back to school. I don't want to be away from you, not even for a day. That's sweet, Matt. You have to go back to school. You can't lose your scholarship. I don't care about my damn scholarship anymore. [giggles] I love you. Do you love me? I care for you so much. I've told you that. [somber music] Matt, the fact that you tell me you love me, that means so much to me. And I want to be an important part of your life. You are my life, Vivian. Matt, listen to me. We both have our own lives to lead. You have to go back to school. I have my family. Stop it, Vivian! I love you! I want to be with you. Matt. Say you love me, too! It's not that easy. You told Justin you loved him. I heard you! Vivian, I've told you things that I've never told anyone before in my life. You're the first person I've trusted enough to do that. Doesn't that mean anything to you? Of course, it does. Then why can't you tell me you love me? Tell me you love me! Matt, you're hurting me. Three words, Vivian! I want to hear them! I love you. Again! I love you. Again! [ominous music] I love you! See, was that so hard? ALEC: You know, I can't believe you actually showed up today. Sorry, man. But it's not like I've been hiding out. Yeah, well, you could have fooled me. MATT TEMPLETON: Alec, have you ever cared about someone so much that it hurt? That if you left them behind, you thought you die? [scoffs] Once. Well, then maybe you'll understand what's been going on. I'm in love. Well, that explains a lot. You finally did it, didn't you? You did it, and you kept it all to yourself. Well, come on, Matt, who is she? Vivian Conrad. We've been seeing each other since the beginning of the summer. We're-- we're in love. Oh, man. You are in way over your head. KATHERINE TEMPLETON: I didn't know whether to show them to you or not. Matt, get in here! Charles, he leaves for school soon. You let me handle this. What? What's going on here? This is Vivian Conrad's credit card. I want an answer. I'm in love with her, mom. [ominous music] You can't mean that. Vivian's the best thing that ever happened to me. You must be out of your mind. Matt, she's a grown woman. She's married. And she has a child. You haven't even finished school. Vivian wants me to finish school. She's the only reason I'm bothering to go back. [sighs] This just isn't normal. Oh, sure, like this family wrote the book on being normal. Just a minute. I'm not through with you yet. Don't you touch me again. KATHERINE TEMPLETON: [sobs] VIVIAN CONRAD: Oh, the cake was so beautiful! Yeah. [chatter] Thank you very much. Oh, this is just-- [doorbell ringing] --lovely. Matt. What are you doing here? We need to talk. This is not a good time. Vivian, my parents found out about us. I thought we had an arrangement. How did that happen? It doesn't matter. They-- they found out! Look, you have to leave now. Vivian, we need to talk. Viv, who is it? Oh, hello, Matt. What can we do for you? Matt just stopped over to say goodbye on his way back to college, isn't that right, Matt? Yeah, sure, whatever. Well, good luck. Uh, you're going to have to excuse us, Matt. We have company Right, company. Sorry, Matt. Yeah, I'm sorry, too. [birds chirping] See you tomorrow, bye. [electric whirring] [sensual music] [water splashing] You are absolutely beautiful. [gasps] Matt, what are you doing here? I wanted to see you before I went off to college. I've been trying to call you for the last couple of days, but Maggie keeps giving me the runaround. How did you get in the house? No one answered. I let myself in. That's OK, isn't it? No, it's not OK. Justin and Lauren will be here in a few minutes. Well, then we got a few minutes. No, don't. Stop it, Matt. We could get caught. You never wanted me to stop before. [ominous music] [moans] [door closing] Justin's home. He's going to kill me if he finds you. Hurry, Matt. Get going, quickly! My shoes. What? - Will you write to me? - Yes, of course, I will. - Promise. - Yes, I promise. Go. Hi! Oh, hi, sweetie. LAUREN: Hi, mom. JUSTIN CONRAD: Lauren, go change, and then you can watch the videos, all right? I think I'll get dressed now. You do that. [school bell tolling] [chatter] VIVIAN CONRAD (VOICEOVER): Dear, Matt, as always, it was great hearing from you. Why is it that whenever I'm alone, my mind goes back to thoughts of you? I can almost touch your smooth skin, see your bright, beautiful eyes, and feel the way you used to hold me in your arms. We both know you going back to school was the right thing to do, but I will always cherish the time we spent together this past summer. I hope your classes are going well. I just know you'll make the dean's list again this semester. I am so proud of you. And I know you have a bright future ahead of you. Write again, soon. I miss you. Vivian. [door closing] Mom's here. Isn't that nice! It's beautiful! Hi, Maggie. Where's Mr. Conrad? He's in your bedroom. Any messages? Matt Templeton called. Three times, mommy. Three times? You better get a move on. We have to be there in an hour. OK, I won't be long. I won't be long at all. Good. [phone ringing] I'll get it. Hello? Thank god, you're home. I've been trying to call you all day. VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): Hi. Hi, Jackie. I guess you can't talk. No, Justin and I are just, uh, getting ready to go out for dinner this evening. Listen, I thought I was always supposed to call you, remember? I know, I know. I-- I couldn't help it. I've been getting your letters, they're great. I can't wait to see you over the holidays. No, actually, this is not a very good time for me to talk. OK. I get it. Well, when would be a good time? I'd love to talk to you. Well, thank you for calling. I'll, uh, talk to you soon. [chatter] [thunder clap] [phone ringing] STUDENT: Hey, Tony, telephone! TONY: Oh, I got it, thanks! [thunder clap] MATT TEMPLETON (VOICEOVER): Dear, Vivian, all I do is think about you. Just when I think I can't miss you anymore, the hurting starts all over again. I see people everywhere, but I don't try to make friends. What's the point? They're not you. I'd much rather be alone in my room with only my thoughts of us. I still can't believe how lucky I am you let me into your life. I asked myself a million times, why me? I think it's because deep down you know that no one will ever love you as much as I do. [crashing] LAUREN: [sobs] Here I am, sweetheart. [sobs] Oh! OK, honey, here take your foot out. Come on, come on. Mommy's going to make that all better. Here, here, you lean on me. Come on now. Lean on me. OK. Is it bad? No, no, nothing a little antiseptic won't fix. I'll be right there, sweetie. [sighs] [ominous music] MATT TEMPLETON (VOICEOVER): When I'm missing you, the most I keep telling myself, I'll be home before I know it and that you'll hold me in your arms again. Remember that I will always love you. Matt. VIVIAN CONRAD: Oh, there. So it wasn't as bad as we thought it was, right? It stings a little bit, but it's better now. VIVIAN CONRAD: OK. Now you go and scoot. You made quite an impression on Matt Templeton last summer. What are you talking about? Care to explain this? Vivian, I want an explanation. VIVIAN CONRAD: Keep your voice down. Lauren can hear every word you say. You always get exactly what you want, don't you, Vivian? Oh, don't you dare look at me like I'm the only one in this room who's ever had an affair. I never claimed to be perfect, but even at my worst, I still used a little common sense. The boy is only 19 years old. Dammit, Vivian, this isn't just a casual affair to him. He thinks he's in love with you. What the hell were you thinking! I was thinking maybe I was happy for a change. For a change. How could you not be happy? You have a daughter who loves you, a beautiful home, clothes, cars, money, the club. I have given you everything you have ever asked for. You just don't get it, do you, Justin? You've given me everything except what I needed. Yeah, what's that? - I needed you. - Uh. But you've never been in this home long enough to even see it. So your way of getting back at me is to have an affair with Matt Templeton? No, I was not getting back at you. I was merely trying to keep myself from being so alone! You don't know the meaning of the word alone till you have to live in this house without your husband or your daughter because that's exactly what's going to happen if you don't cut this thing off with Matt. I will see to it that you lose everything, me, Lauren, everything. Do I make myself perfectly clear? Do I! Call Matt. I think you know the number. [ominous music] [phone ringing] [knocking] What is it? STUDENT: Phone call, Templeton. Who is it? STUDENT: Some woman named Vivian. [ominous music] Hi, I can't believe you called. Matt, I have something to say to you. It's important that you listen very closely. What are you talking about? It's over, Matt. You can't possibly mean that, Vivian. Justin found one of your letters. He knows everything. I don't give a damn if your husband found out or not! VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): I'm sorry, Matt. It's over. But you told me you love me! VIVIAN CONRAD (ON PHONE): I have to hang up now. No, don't. Please, don't-- Vivian, don't hang up! [ominous music] CHARLES CONRAD (ON PHONE): Hello? Hello! [tires screeching] [doorbell ringing] JUSTIN CONRAD: [sighs] What the hell do you want? Where's Vivian? JUSTIN CONRAD: Mrs. Conrad is upstairs asleep. I need to talk to Vivian. JUSTIN CONRAD: That's not possible. You're no longer welcome in our home. Vivian! Vivian! Would you shut up! Now are you going to leave on your own, Matt, or do I have to call the police? Yes, I'd like to report an intruder, 903 Braxton Way. Thank you. The police are on their way. Do you care to wait in the den? Are you proud of yourself? LAUREN: Mom? What's wrong? Nothing, sweetheart. Daddy just thought he heard something. You go back to bed. [shouting, screaming] KATHERINE TEMPLETON: No, don't! JUSTIN CONRAD: [shouts] KATHERINE TEMPLETON: [screams] Get away from her! You hear me? Leave her alone! KATHERINE TEMPLETON: No, Matt, no! Please? No! Matt! Don't! No! No! [groans] Where's your belt now, Dad? Matt, stop it! You've got two choices. You can pack your bags and get out of our lives, or I can finish you off right now! Which is too going to be? I was only trying to do the right thing, Matt. I know. I know. What on Earth brought you home from school? Let's get you some sleep, and we'll talk about it in the morning. [chatter] Ma'am. Matt's back! Son of a bitch. Justin, please, let it go. Hello. Hello. [chuckling] No, she's said it. I promise you. [chuckles] Yeah. Oh, OK. I've got to go, though. Lauren and Justin are going to be looking all over for me. Bye, girls. Bye. I'm not so sure that you should be here. It's OK. I just got my old job back. Well, that's not going to change anything. I still can't see you anymore. Not now, but it will. I know Justin made you say those things. And he was right. I love you, Vivian. And I'm-- I'm willing to wait for you, no matter how long it takes. I'm here to take you back. Look, it's over Matt. Nothing can change that. Vivian? You'll find somebody else. You'll find someone who is right for you. Vivian, I don't want anybody else. I want you. You can't have me. You can't! You're tearing yourself up over something that can never be. Look at me. You have got to let this go. [somber music] Do you understand? We have hurt enough people already. So next week same time. No. [chuckles] Oh, I understand. You'll take care of it? Good. [ominous music] - Thanks, Brent. Don't worry, Mr. Conrad, leave it to me. You're the best. Sure. [chatter] [phone ringing] Brent from the club is on the phone. [buzzing] Vivian! [dogs barking] [buzzing] [lounge music] Where was Lauren off to in such a hurry tonight? Oh, the Hendersons for a slumber party. She was very excited. [chuckles] MATT TEMPLETON: Let go of me! I have to speak to Mr. Conrad. Get off me. I'm very sorry, Mr. Conrad. JUSTIN CONRAD: It's all right, Henry. I'll take care of this. Matt, why don't you grab a chair and join us, hm? That'll be all. Yes, sir. What seems to be the problem? You are the problem. You just decided I can't have a job here. I have no idea what you're talking about. You liar! Matt, calm down. He had me fired, Vivian! That job was the only thing I had left. JUSTIN CONRAD: I don't think this is the time or the place to be discussing your employment problems, Matt. My problems are your problems, Mr. Conrad. You should know that by now. You have to tell him, Vivian. You have to tell him everything. Tell him what, Matt? - Take Mr. Templeton outside. - Yes, sir. Come on. It's time everyone knows the truth, Vivian! SECURITY: Go on. That's it. Come on. MATT TEMPLETON: Let go of me! SECURITY: Come on, now. MATT TEMPLETON: Vivian! SECURITY: Relax. [lounge music] VIVIAN CONRAD: Dear, Matt, alone again with only my thoughts of you. I can almost taste your lips touching mine, and it triggers my craving for you. [ominous music] What starts out as soft and gentle soon bursts into full-blown passion. I can feel your hands move along my body, and my need for you grows until it's almost unbearable. Oh, I miss you so very much. Oh! Morning. Hi, Vivian. [whispering] Morning. Hi, Mrs. Conrad. [giggling] Good morning. That bastard! [bar music] You did what? I copied the letter she sent me, the one about how I made love to her, about how she missed being with me, everything. Tell me you're making this up, man. You are making this up. No, I really did it. Excuse me. [chatter] I plastered it everywhere. I plastered it all over the club, all over their neighborhood, everywhere. What did you do that for? Because the Conrads run around telling lies about me. That's why. I can't let them get away with that, Alec. I want everyone to know the truth about me and Vivian. The truth about you and Vivian. The truth is she used you. She used you, and she dumped you. You don't understand. We loved each other. Matt, it had nothing to do with love. Damn it, Alec! Matt, I know what I'm talking about. No, you don't! No one understands. Matt, I do understand. Did she give you a shirt, too? [ominous music] I thought so. Matt, I hate to break this to you, but she does this every summer. Last summer, it was me. [scoffs] Don't worry, man. You'll get over it. I did. [doorbell ringing] Yes. I'm here to see Matt Templeton. Just a minute. Matt? Someone to see you. Matt Templeton? Yeah? As an officer of the court, I've been instructed to deliver this into your hands. Here. What is this? If you have any questions, just call the number at the bottom of the document. Good day, sir. Come on. Good. This is 2 for 2 and 3 for 3! Do right hand. OK, right hand? [groans] Time out, time out. Change of player. [chuckles] Go on. Go on. OK. See you in a minute. Are you ready for this? Oh, sorry. [tires screeching] Lauren, go inside. LAUREN: Oh, Mom. No, go inside now, Lauren. Tell Daddy that I need him out here right away. You must want to go to jail. What do you mean? Weren't you served with restraining papers this morning? Oh, yeah. Big deal. Yes, it is a very big deal. You're not allowed to be here legally. If you don't leave, I'll have you arrested. I should have you arrested anyway. For what? For making some sick, public joke of my letters. How could you do that? Alec told me everything. [ominous music] Justin! Save your breath, Vivian. Justin can't get you out of this one. Everything's a game to you, isn't it, Vivian! I loved you! I trusted you! You never cared about me! You only care about yourself! You're just like everyone else! [ominous music] [knocking] MATT TEMPLETON: Uh, come in, Mom. What's the matter? I thought you had a job interview. I didn't go. Oh, Matt, why not? Uh, I had some stuff on my mind. It still hurts, doesn't it? Yeah. I really loved her, Mom. But after what she did to me, I-- I hate her, too. I don't know. I can't tell the difference between love and hate anymore. They both just feel the same to me. You can't hide in your room forever. That won't make your problems with Vivian go away. Sooner or later, you're going to have to come out and face the world. Tell you what, why don't you put on a fresh shirt and go see if you can still have that interview? Yeah, anything you say, Mom. Matt, everything's going to be just fine. [chatter] [laughter] I'm sorry. What a shot. I got lucky, again. He's here again. It's all right. I can handle it. Are you sure? I'm sure. Look, would you ask Justin to check on Lauren? What is it now, Matt? I just wanted you to know that I'm sorry I ever even met you, Vivian. [ominous music] Vivian! [gunshot] Vivian! [gunshots] MAN: Somebody call an ambulance! Help! Somebody call an ambulance, now! [door closing] Hi, honey. How did the interview go? [ominous music] [knocking] Matt, what's wrong? Matt, what's the matter? [sirens wailing] Come on, give us some backup here. [radio chatter] There he is! There he is! No! Get her out of here now! You have the right to remain silent. If you give up this right, anything you say can and will be used against you. MATT TEMPLETON (VOICEOVER): Vivian looked me right in the eye an instant before I pulled the trigger. It was as though she knew what was going to happen and why. KATHERINE TEMPLETON: No! No! Matt! I love you, Matt. [radio chatter] MATT TEMPLETON (VOICEOVER): Vivian meant everything to me, but nobody understood that, not even her. Maybe now, they'll all understand. [somber music] KATHERINE TEMPLETON: [sobs] No!
