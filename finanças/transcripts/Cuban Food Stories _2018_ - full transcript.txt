I left Cuba for the first time when I was five years old. My parents jobs sent my family to New York. When we returned to Cuba in 1991, I was 11 years old and my father took us on a road trip around the island to reconnect with our roots. Soon after, with the collapse of the Soviet union, everything changed. Cuba's relationship with food became complicated. I remember family reunions, birthdays and parties. I remember people playing dominoes in the streets, loud noises, laughter. I remember grandiose buildings, reminders of a golden era that was no longer. This is the street where I was born. This is the house where I grew up. I can picture endless nights on the porch with my friends. They loved to talk about Soviet cartoons and everything I missed while abroad. In return, I told them stories of Mickey Mouse and Disney World. As we went through middle school, the country entered a profound economic crisis, ironically named the special period. Cubans lost everything. While my parents worked tirelessly to save the revolution, I dreamed about returning to New York and becoming a filmmaker. And so, in February 2008, I left Cuba for good. I still remember the waves, crashing gently against the shore of Havana. The elderly bathing in the morning, as the sun kisses the city with light. I have so many memories, and yet, my memories about food are very vague. During the nineties we were so caught up in survival, that food became simply fuel. All around the country, ingredients disappeared. Beef was replaced by soybeans. Cooking oil was replaced by water. And the list went on and on. Nationwide, recipes started changing. All the excitement for cooking was gone. Perhaps that's the reason why as an adult food is such an important part of my life. The food we cook not only makes us human, but it's a primal element in understanding who we are as a culture. So I returned to Cuba to find those missing flavors. I embarked on a quest to discover what Cubans of all classes do to overcome hardship and keep their culinary heritage alive. A new road trip to reconnect with my roots. I didn't set out to make a documentary about the well-known Cuban sandwich or the rice and black beans. Instead, this would be a journey through the unknown Cuban food stories. The first stop was Juragua, a tiny but enchanting fisherman village. Juragua sits by the ruins of a nuclear city, home to the biggest economic collaboration between the revolution and the USSR. A failed nuclear power plant. During the eighties, the entire town mobilized and worked around the clock to create the first nuclear power plant in the Caribbean. They built the reactor facilities. And then in turn you see for the scientists, roads, hospitals. But the nuclear plant was never completed. Now, everything sits in ruins. For the people of Juragua, nuclear city's just a ghost of the past. Ernesto followed his parent's dreams. He was not going to be a fisherman. Instead, the revolution sent him to college for free. It was there that he met his wife. They both became nuclear physicists. But after many years of studies, with no nuclear plant in Cuba, Ernesto had no choice but to return to the sea. When I was a kid, my parents sent me to the Escambray Mountains to help cure my asthma. People always believed that these mountains had magical healing powers. I heard that one of the best cooks in Cuba was living in these mountains. I didn't have an address, just a name. So we stopped at a timbiriche, a Cuban food stall, and we got some coconut along with our directions. The coconut was topped with honey and a little bit of run, because hey, why not? It's already 10:00 AM here in the countryside. With no internet or GPS, getting directions can be tricky. Three kilometers after the big tree, turn left a minute after the bus stop. So we went from timbiriche to timbiriche, til we arrived at a simple and beautiful house. This was paradise. Here we found Migdalia and Gilberto. They met each other over 20 years ago. Migdalia used to be the most famous hairdresser in the big town where she was from. Gilberto was a mountain man. His only possessions, a small shack in the mountains by a cascade, his plot of land and his hands to work the earth. It was love at first sight. Her friends tried to convince her not to move to the middle of nowhere, but they were in love and had a beautiful farm which they could call home. When she moved in, they had no kitchen, no electricity, no running water. Gilberto worked the land and Migdalia dedicated herself to renovating the house. No one ever taught her how to cook. When they moved in together, she barely knew how to boil an egg. But there is a saying in Cuba. Love enters through the kitchen. So she taught herself how to cook, made sure that love entered their kitchen and stayed. To this day, their rule still stands. Gilberto works the land and Migdalia runs the house. About eight years ago, some medical students snuck onto their property to swim in the waterfall. Instead of kicking them out, she invited them for lunch with her family, having seen that the only had some bread to eat. They were captivated. As simple as it was, they had never tried something so authentic. They started encouraging everyone they knew to go to try Migdalia's food. Soon, she became famous. She doesn't have a formal restaurant. There's no menu. But if you're around at lunchtime, you can stop by and you might be lucky enough to try her delicious creole cuisine. She's too shy to put a set price on her food, but donations are always welcome. We got lucky and she cooked a fabulous meal for us. A very traditional Cuban feast. Rice and black beans dormidos, the slow braised and succulent fried pork, garlic tostones, fried plantains, yuca with mojo sauce, and a delicious pork belly polenta to top it all off. The aroma began to remind me of my early childhood days in the kitchen with my grandma Caridad. Long before the collapse of the Soviet union, Grandma also loved the smoky flavors of cooking with wood. We had lunch in the most beautiful setting, right by the waterfall. With every bite of Migdalia's food, I could feel the lost memories of these old mountain flavors starting to return. Surrounded by the Escambray Mountains on one side and the Caribbean Sea and the other, is the city of Trinidad. Trinidad looks like the cliche poster city of the Caribbean. It started as a settlement of aristocrats, with palaces built on cobblestone roads. All of it paid for by their nearby sugarcane plantations. But when the island's economy changed due to the industrial revolution, the mountains became a barrier that isolated the city. Without a train through the hills, the wealthy inhabitants began to take their wealth and leave. Decades of isolation have left Trinidad a city frozen in time. Now, the city's primary industry is tourism. In 1997, the government began to grant licenses for casas particulares, private accommodations that function as bed and breakfasts, catering mainly to foreign visitors. This is one of the oldest forms of private business in revolutionary Cuba, and the casas particulares in Trinidad are some of the best in the country. This is not the first time that I find myself in Trinidad. When I was an art student, we used to come backpacking here all the time. Back then, what we could afford was water with brown sugar and bread with oil and salt. So I was curious to find out how the impact of international tourism had changed the local cuisine. Behind every door in Trinidad hides a very different story. Many people here have been so poor for so long that they lost most of their culinary traditions. But behind Yohan's doors, life is different. Everything from his pork ribs with local honey marinade, the lobster with avocado rice, the red snapper on banana leaves, the shrimp with pineapple and rum, and the the fruit ceviche and flan, shows a passionate family commitment to keeping their heritage alive. It's been 12 years since the last time I came to Las Parrandas de Remedios, a Christmas festival that has become the most passionate celebration on the island. My father used to tell me stories about all the great street food vendors at the carnivals of his childhood. He even remembers some of them by name. But those are not my memories. In the revolutionary society that my father helped build, those preferred vendors were no longer allowed. In my lifetime, there were massive shortages of everything and the state imposes so many regulations that at the carnival all you could get was some bad beer and wake up with a massive hangover. But times are changing, and I wondered, who is shaping the new street food memories for thousands of Cubans? On the plaza, the party's getting started. The plaza has no computers or fancy controllers, just improvised systems made by locals. For Felito, this is turning out to be his biggest night of the year. But then the unthinkable happens. A power outage in the vendor section. Word comes that the electric company can not fix the problem until the carnival is over. Power outages are not new to us. When I was growing up we had so many that we stopped keeping track. Since nobody had generators or gas, we only counted the few hours we did have power, calling them alumbrones, brief moments of illumination. We could hear the chanting, the cheering, and the fireworks in the distance. The party was not going to stop. For Felito, his main vault meter is just cut. You can smell the smoked meats, the crispy fried chicken, and the rosca de reyes from far away. Like a jazz band leader, Felito runs every detail of his kitchen. The carnival is now going at full speed. For almost two centuries, the town has been divided into two clans, El Carmen and El Salvador. On this night, the competition for the best show will be fierce. The townspeople of Remedios spend an entire year preparing for this showdown. They set aside all political views and work together for the same goal. This is something that is not common in the island. All of the handmade costumes, the makeshift fireworks, the improvised and handcrafted lighting design, and extravagant floats are made by the locals, paid out of pocket and with the support of both Cuban experts and government funds. Tonight, they don't care where it all comes from. They're all just celebrating together and fighting for their clans, their friends, their families. Back at the shop, it's already 3:00 AM. Things are winding down and it's starting to rain. On the plaza, the rain forces the parade to stop. The sun is already coming out. But the fireworks battle rages on. At the end, one of the clans will win this wild celebration. But there is no jury. The winners will know they won when the losers will walk home with their heads down, their only comfort knowing that next year they will fight again and maybe bring the victory home. I kept thinking about Felito's intoxicating happiness. Sure, the carnival street food vendors still have ways to go. But year after year they make it better. Who knows, maybe in five years we will realize that this was the spark that ignited them all. Gibara is very close to my heart. Nearby is where my mother was born. I spent many afternoons looking at this bay, trying to understand how the fishermen could walk so far out into the water. My grandpa used to tell me it was because they were giants. But the life of a giant can be poor and lonely. Every day they go out to catch whatever the bay has to offer. Usually just enough to survive. Gibara is one of those peculiar and contradictory Cuban towns. A surreal fisherman village where the government, always afraid of people fleeing the island by the sea, might restrict the use of boats on any given day. Habana carries the scars of unattended age, although we call it pride. There was a time when the traditional shellfish street food vendors were found all over the city, but the government has taken all the licenses away. Today, only three remain. Here, in the small culinary school, I discovered a profound and passionate desire for keeping the local traditions alive. Once a month, the grandmas and the best cooks in town come here to teach the younger generation about the traditional home made Habana cuisine. Just like the grandmothers learned from their moms and grandmas. A tradition that's passed down the line. For these classes, the students and the staff of the school spend all night in the bay to catch what they're going to cook the next day. They understand that their cuisine is unique to the island, and that keeping these flavors alive, it will bring back authenticity to the food and prosperity to their town. They've made a stuffed blue crab, rice with coquina clams, Gibarian Paella, oyster cocktails, crab enchilada, and a seafood polenta like I have never tried before. But the hard times keep coming to Gibara. A couple of months after we filmed, the culinary school was shut down indefinitely. The state wanted to use the location for a government run cafeteria instead. This is our humble homage to the people of Gibara. It was about time to have a good cafecito in Cuba. So I decided to head southeast and go into Sierra Maestra, the biggest mountain range on the island. From these mountains, Fidel Castro orchestrated the Cuban revolution. Here, they have always cultivated the best coffee in Cuba. Always forgotten by the status quo, the people of these lands give food and shelter to the insurgency led by Castro. Today, not many people come this far into la Sierra. You have to cross rivers and a variety of terrain to get here. Lucky for us, my cousin Roberto drives a military grade Russian truck. So he gave us a lift to his good friend's coffee plantation. As we leave the Sierra, Emmanuel's coffee and Gerardo's poems travel with us. This is Baracoa, the first city in Cuba. The most fascinating landscapes on the island are found here. A few months after we filmed, hurricane Matthew ripped up most of this historic town. It will be many years before they get fully back on their feet. These are the stories of the charming people of this land. We leave the beach and we go deep into the mountains to a place where no commerce have ever been. In the Toa river, we tried exquisite regional dishes like river shrimp in coconut milk, and bacan, a like a local version of tamale made with plantains and pork chunk. Dishes that I would have never suspected were a part of a rural Cuban cuisine. I felt humbled and grateful to be a part of their family for one day. As Gerardo gave us a ride in his cayuco, I could not help but feel a little sad to be leaving. So much kindness along the way, and our trip was almost over. Tomorrow we will be in Pinar del Río, where another special celebration awaits. Being here reminds me of many new years with my family and friends. We always wished for great things to happen, but every year we just kept waiting. Would I feel something different today? There is now renewed hope in the future. As if the bad things are starting to burn away. We're back in Havana, our last stop. But Havana is not the same city that I left all those years ago. After many uneventful decades, the last couple of years have been an emotional rollercoaster for the people of Cuba. The relationship with the longtime enemy has gone from nonexistent to something is happening to a recently very complicated status. On a government level, the island is going through a major transitional period. All of this has ignited a new wave of international tourism and a new community of Cuban entrepreneurs are experiencing an exciting creative boom. I started this trip feeling like an outsider, searching for missing links to our culinary culture and traditions, hoping to rescue flavors and stories before they fade away. Along the way, the people we met opened their houses, kitchens, and hearts. They share all they have with love and generosity. Regardless of differences in political views and economic position, we all speak the language of food and share the passion for our heritage. The Cuba I rediscovered is not the country that my parents and their generation gave their life for. It's also not the country that the opposition sees. It's a country with many inequalities and critical problems that only those in power can control. But Cubans all over the world have to stop treating each other like enemies. We have to look for shared values and build upon them. It is up to us to tolerate our different views and break the barriers that have divided so many generations and families. The future for Cuba is uncertain, but if there is one thing we know for sure, it's that together, we can create a shared future in Cuba, a country moving forward, making constant progress, like the endless waves crashing against the Havana sea wall.
