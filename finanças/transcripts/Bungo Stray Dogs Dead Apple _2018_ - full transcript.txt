"The 88 days that produced the most corpses in the history of the Yokohama underworld, and the tumultuous event that dragged many groups and organizations into itself... The Dragon Head War" "On the eve of its finale" I've had enough of this sight. Bodies strewn as far as the eye can see. You've got some luck to have survived all this. Odasaku. Dazai, where are you? I have an idea what you're up to but get out of there ASAP. Trouble is on its way. Scram, flunkey! Hey there Chuya, you're within the firing line now so eat a load of bullets and die. Shut up! Damn ability user! I'll show you who's boss. Would've been so much funnier if that bolt did you in. Zip it, Dazai you shitbag. You're five minutes late. That's three more fists than I had to take. How about I add to that number and finish you? I'm not the one you have to kill. Like vermin out of the woodwork. Let's get this over with. You would've seen this coming. Right, I still have a bone to pick with you. It will be mine. It won't be mine. It will be mine. It won't be mine. It will be mine. It won't be mine. It will be mine. It won't be mine. It will be mine. It won't be mine. It will be mine. It won't be mine. Those gems are real. Could've made someone a very happy lady. It won't be mine. This cheap fortune-telling doesn't please me. Forming an organization didn't get me what I what. Let my buddies go. Welcome, my unimpressive guests. I doubt you could grant me that which I desire. Hurry off to the afterlife, as the ones before you have. Your friends took their own lives. Unimpressive people remain unimpressive even in death. You bastard... Don't stop me. Good gracious... The extreme of dark corruption... Such fun this is.

No, but it must be for someone dear to you. "S.Oda" What makes you say that? Cause I've seen you visit a grave before. Do I look like I'm paying my respects? You do. Odasaku! Odasaku... What should I do? Be on the side that saves people. If both sides are the same, be a good person. Help the weak, and protect orphans. I know good and evil means nothing to you, but you'd be a better man that way. How do you know that? Of course I know. I know better than anyone. Because... I'm your friend. Could it be that this belongs to your lover? We'd have died together if there was a woman I loved. I guess that makes sense, for you. Did you say something? Oh, nothing. He's a friend. He's the man who made me leave the Port Mafia and join the Detective Agency. Without him I would still be in the mafia and continue taking lives. Just kidding. You must be here looking for me on Kunikida-kun's orders. Yeah... There's an important meeting. I'll pass. Eh? There's a new suicide method I'm itching to try. Not again... Geez. I'm in for another earful from Kunida-san. "Dihua Street, Taipei" This is security cam footage from three years ago in Taipei, Taiwan. As you can see, in minutes it was enveloped by a thick fog that promptly vanished. This was no case of extreme weather. Immediately afterwards a suspicious body was found. It was this charred corpse. How awful. Kunikida. Yes? This man was an ability user? Spot on, Ranpo-san. He was well-known among the locals for his fire manipulating ability. This was a year ago in Singapore. Another thick fog was reported and once more an unnatural death was left in its wake. He had the ability to manipulate cards and was a skilled assassin. This was half a year ago in Detroit. Yet another corpse discovered after the fog. As you could guess, her ability let her create ice. In short, after a mysterious fog, ability users across the globe were killed by their own powers. Is that right? Does the fog have something to do with it? There have been at least 128 known incidents thought to be connected from which over 500 ability users have lost their lives. The Special Abilities Bureau calls this the "Ability Users Serial Suicide Case". Speaking of suicide... Where's that idiot Dazai, Atsushi? He said he'd rather try out a new suicide method. That blasted numbskull! I see... What are you doing, Ranpo-san? I'm not telling. Does contact with the fog cause ability users to kill themselves? Not on my watch! I'll never let you die and leave me all alone. - You're killing me... - So, what does this have to do with us? I doubt it's a simple warning because we have abilities? We've been asked to investigate by the Bureau. A suspected person of interest to these string of suicides has reportedly infiltrated Yokohama. They would like us to secure this man. Tatsuhiko Shibusawa, 29. All we know is he has an ability and is known as the Collector. Something catch your eye? Nah, it's nothing. The Armed Detective Agency accepts this job. Not just because it brings harm to ability users and may endanger the Agency and its employees too, but because I suspect a far greater disaster threatens the public at large. The Detective Agency hereby devotes all its resources into investigating this man! What do you think, Kunikida-san? About what? Is this string of suicides even possible? Hard to say. Supposing the cause is a mind control ability, one as powerful as this would be known to investigation agencies worldwide. I hope the Bureau agent we're about to meet can tell us more. Right on time, not a second late. Kunikida-san! It's the agent. He's dead. What is it? Did the culprit leave this? An apple? Kunikida-san, why an apple? Hell if I know. "Lupin" What are we toasting to? Couldn't you wait for Ango? How about a little chat then? I heard something interesting recently. Ever heard of suicide by apple? Suicide by apple? Yup, using an apple to die. Oh, Cinderella. Cinderella... Have to say even I didn't expect that. Never a dull moment talking to you. Just so you know, it was Snow White who ate the poisoned apple and she did not kill herself. I see. I got it wrong. Hold on. Perhaps Snow White did commit suicide. Did she bite the apple knowing it had poison? What for? Despair. Despair over her own mother wanting to poison her. No... Maybe it was despair over something indiscernible in this world? Wouldn't that be fascinating? I met a fascinating ability user. He can make people commit suicide by apple. I sense a new fad coming to Yokohama. Suicide? A fad? Yep. Doesn't that sound great? You're a funny guy. Your thoughts are like clothes in a washing machine. I'm not as funny as you. Ango sure is late. He won't be coming. Odasaku, everything you've said was right. Being on the side that saves is great. If you want to live, that is. I'll be going now, Odasaku. Dazai-kun. Oh Ango, you came. Here for a drink? No, I'm on duty. Duty? Tatsuhiko Shibusawa. Weren't you the one who called him here? Are you trying to have ability users throughout Yokohama kill themselves? Do you think you could catch me? Get out, you worthless parasite! You are no longer welcome at the orphanage. The world would be a better place if you end up dead in a ditch! - What's that? - There isn't a single place where you belong. Was that... a dream? May I come in? Oh, sure... Are you alright? Why do you ask? You were moaning in your sleep. Yeah. I had a nightmare. Wait! What're you... Kyoka-chan!? Was there fog in your nightmare? Huh? Is this... There's no reception. Mine too. Could this be the fog that makes ability users commit suicide? Let's head to the Agency. R-Right now? T-The fog might lift in no... Hey, Kyoka-chan? Kyoka-chan! How's the driver? What's going on? Kyoka-chan. Silence befell the city. It was as though every person had vanished. Get out, you worthless parasite! There isn't a single place where you belong. Kyoka-chan. I sense great enmity. Kyoka-chan! Is this suicide through an ability? But there's no body... Let's do this, Kyoka-chan! Ability: Beast Beneath the Moonlight! Ability: Yasha Shirayuki! Kunikida-san? Atsushi... You're hurt! Were you shot? Don't worry, I removed the bullet. More importantly, I know what's causing these suicides. Run for it! Hurry, Kunikida-san! Kunikida-san! Kyoka-chan? You okay? What happened? I was attacked by my own ability. Your own ability? Yasha Shirayuki! Hop in! Run, Atsushi! Kunikida-san, could the cause you mentioned be... The victims didn't kill themselves. They were killed by their own abilities. We have to hurry to the Agency. What happened here? To the president's office! Kunikida-san!? What is that? We have a connection. Please keep this frequency stable. Can you hear me? Is this President Fukuzawa? I'm Kunikida, an agent. I take that you're with the Special Abilities Bureau? The Special Abilities Bureau? I'm Ango Sakaguchi from the Special Abilities Bureau. Kunikida-san, what's the situation there? I have Atsuhi Nakajima and Kyoka Izumi with me. All other Agency members are unaccounted for. Understood. The line isn't stable so I'll keep it brief. Yokohama has been met with the fog phenomenon. Fog of this scale is unprecedented. It halted its expansion after enveloping all of Yokohama, separating it from the rest of the world. The majority of Yokohama is either missing or have vanished. It seems only those with abilities remain. In short, you are in danger. We have seen it for ourselves. In this fog, ability users are divorced of their ability which then sets out to kill them. This doesn't look good. Fortunately, we have the location of the ability user suspected of being the cause. In the center of the Yokohama settlement lies an abandoned high-rise called the Corpse Fortress. Is it Tatsuhiko Shibusawa? I would like to submit a critical request to the Detective Agency. Please exterminate the mastermind, Tatsuhiko Shibusawa. Whichever method will do. Also, as an addendum, it appears that Dazai-kun is with him. Dazai? Was he captured? Yokohama is at risk of being wiped off the map. You're our only hope... "Hand grenade" It's here... You two go ahead. I'll hold it back. But Kunikida-san... You don't stand a chance against your own ability. It's not a matter of whether I can or cannot. What matters is if I'm willing to fight. I must surpass myself. That's how I've always lived. That's... We are the Armed Detective Agency. Take it. I don't need one. My ability can't create anything larger than a notebook. Escape from the back while I have its attention. Hurry! Have you tracked down ability user No. A5158? Yes. Please send a message. What do I say? Time to repay your debt to Prof. Glasses. Kunikida-san! He'll be fine, right? Our priority now is to eliminate Tatsuhiko Shibusawa. Tatsuhiko Shibusawa... What sort of man is he? You speak of eliminating him, but no matter how bad he may be there's no need to kill. We just have to capture him. Dazai-san can deal with him once he's been rescued. That's right, we just have to save Dazai-san... He'll be able to do it. Dazai-kun. Do you not tire of that sight? Tire? Indeed, such boredom. The landscape white and empty. A world filled with gravel. All the abilities in Yokohama shall me mine. Once more my intellect remains unchallenged, my plans on course. How unremarkable. I too, once suffered from the boredom you feel. How did you overcome this wretched ailment? A demonstration would be better than a description. See? My intentions remain a mystery to you. Am I assisting you or will I betray you for my own ends? The only mystery here is why you consider yourself unreadable. It seems you are in need of salvation. Who, pray tell, will deliver this salvation you speak of? Who knows? It could be an angel... or the devil. As far as I'm concerned, both your intentions are like an open book. Such lies do not spin an engaging tale. The audience would sooner leave their seats. Demon Fyodor-kun. I shall have you dance on stage as a collaborator. Collaborate? When he's most likely to betray? There are no lies in that statement. None have ever proven my predictions wrong. I hope to see it happen. I must say, the ability users of this city have my deepest condolences. Regardless of which one of us comes out on top, the only fate in store for them... is death. What'll happen if our abilities don't return? Are you sure it's safe to drive this fast in a fog? I have all of Yokohama's terrain memorized. My skills as an assassin are independent from my special ability. When I first learned that I rampaged as a tiger, I wished for this power to disappear. Who'd have though that very tiger would be my enemy? I have never once thought of Yasha Shirayuki, my parents' killer, as an ally. If she opposes me then I will take her down. Incoming! The safety. Go! This instant! You're... Akutagawa! What a pitiful weapon. Shame that peashooter does nothing to it. Interesting. Shall we observe who triumphs? Now's not the time for this. There should be a hidden passage for Mafia executives nearby. Come, Weretiger. Hey! Get going! I'll catch up! Alright... Kyoka-chan! This is an evacuation route built to withstand ability users. The fog would not reach here. What is that fog? It is the dragon's breath. Dragon? Kyoka, as we are both without our abilities, you could easily take me out. Why the silence? Do you not want to settle this score? You don't mean anything to her now! Would you rather we settle our score before regaining our abilities? Do you have a way to get them back? I know how. What? Defeating an ability returns it to its user. Are you incapable of discovering this much? What're you after? The same thing as us, probably. Which means... Shibusawa? I'll tear out his entrails and end his life. Is there any other way to save Yokohama? We won't kill. That's not what a detective does! Hysterical. How sheltered you are, Weretiger. What? Kyoka understands what must be done. For she was once with the Port Mafia. I set out to live under the light. I left the Port Mafia to join the Detective Agency. Killing for the Mafia and killing for the Agency are different. Kyoka-chan? Had Dazai-san not taken the enemy's side, stopping this fog without killing would have been possible. Dazai-san joined the enemy? Indeed. He stands by him of his own volition. Dazai-san would never do that! He has already betrayed the Port Mafia once. I will be the one to kill him. Can you really? I can, if the alternative is letting another do the deed. I won't let you do it. We're not going with you. I will. What? Behold, my collection room. Welcome to Draconia. Are these all crystalized abilities? I'm impressed that you've gathered this many. 'Tis a fine hobby. A collection worthy of the devil's envy. Does that make you a rat of death, here to sell knowledge to the devil? I collected most of these using information on ability users supplied by you. As a result I was able to cover the entire city in this massive foggy domain. I do wonder how you were able to procure said information? You find rats in every corner of the city. Meow. Here comes another one. An ability user somewhere in Yokohama has died. And yet... It remains pointless without the one ability to adorn this altar. No matter how many I gather... Kyoka-chan. Why are you sticking with this guy? He has information. He has access to this secret passage. Above all, he'll be a valuable combatant with his ability restored. Our goal of eliminating Shibusawa remains the same. Even so... Kyoka, I see that you still cherish your mother's phone. Her mother? Have you not been told that? I haven't... What's the shortest route? 0505. Makes sense that it can tell where I am. I'll help. Unnecessary. To prove my own strength, I wandered many a night and slaughtered many a foe. But I have been blind. Blind to not have seen that a worthy foe had been here all along. He's so selfish... We have our own problems to confront. Huh? You must deal with your own matter. Kyoka-chan! To me, people are but simple, easy to understand machines dressed in flesh. All except for one. Myself. Do you even have friends? I find them unnecessary, for I can read the hearts of others. I shall traverse between the lines, past the blank spaces of my story where a world beyond lies waiting. You wouldn't be spouting all that if you actually had friends. The hour approaches. All of Yokohama's abilities will soon be mine. Do you think that anyone is capable of overcoming their own ability? Rashomon attacks by launching its cloth turned to blades. Therefore as long as I maintain my distance, I remain out of reach. Curses... How do I beat it? Will breaking that do the trick? Damn it! It's impossible to beat your own ability. Phew! Yasha Shirayuki killed my mother. Even if I defeat her, she will return to me and I become one with her. Just as I planned. What!? Truly an ability worthy of me. However... All is as should be. This is where you belong. Yasha Shirayuki is the incarnation of slaughter. Even so... Despite that... In spite of everything, I... In spite of everything... In spite of everything, you wish to use that power for the sake of others? Kyoka... Kyoka-chan! Shatter the crystal on her forehead! Here he comes. Who is? A5158. You've got guts to call me like you're ordering takeaway. Everyone, please leave us for a while. This is a government facility. Did you think you could barge in like this? I play by my own rules. Not yours. I believe you still owe me. Don't you mean you owe me? What are you talking about? Quit playing dumb. Did you think I wouldn't know? I'm talking six years ago. How are your wounds? I'm fine. They should heal once the tiger's power kicks in. Corpse Fortress. That's where Dazai-san is. Everything will be fine once we save him. You got your ability back. Why don't I have the tiger's healing despite beating Byakko? Did you get yours back too? Why hasn't mine returned? Fool! Do you still not understand? What's that... What is this shit!? Akutagawa! What do you mean!? Hey! Your wounds are heavy. Rest here. Kyoka-chan? I'm sorry for not telling you. I didn't want you to know. Know what? That Yasha Shirayuki, who I control with my phone, was never someone I wanted to hate. I will finish our mission. Wait a sec... Kyoka-chan... Kyoka-chan! That's why you're no good! What's this about? It's the government who involved Shibusawa in the Dragon Head War six years ago. All in the name of ending the strife that dragged in all of Yokohama. Except maintaining order is an alien concept to him. All he did was raise the body count. Even so you government shitheads kept protecting him because he's a valuable ability user capable of repelling a nationwide uprising by other users. Not only did you look the other way to the corpses he continued to pile up but also aided in sweeping them under the rug. Everything was to keep the country in peace. Better watch your tongue, Prof. Glasses. If it weren't for you bastards, six of my friends would still be alive. Will you kill me? I don't care if you do. I was prepared for this when I called you. That settles it. I'll take the job. You'll pay me with your life. All according to plan. Sure is. It wasn't easy. Earning his trust to get in here, that is. By the way, what's your real reason for working with me? I merely seek to see the world as it should be. Still, this party would be livelier with more acts on display. So it's a game of guessing who the clown is? I'm not thrilled to join forces with you, but it was necessary to make Shibusawa the clown. He has even the Japanese government by the nose after all. He would have summoned the fog in Yokohama regardless of whether you lead him to or not. Go on. One crystal gathers all ability users within sight to one place. Another combines the powers of ability users touched into one. Both together will allow you to take in this entire collection and the fog will disappear without energy to maintain it. First you must free them from their crystal prisons with your nullification so that they may return to their original states. I hope Atsushi-kun and the others are alright. All that's left is to erase that and it'll be over. Did I not say that none have proven my predictions wrong? Wasn't the door... locked... Oh, I see. This is where your treachery comes in. What did I say about having more acts to liven the party? Okay, then what's your next move? There is no next move. My goal has always been you. I thought the best this fruit knife could do was sting. You poisoned it. A lethal paralytic. Enjoy it. It's the death you've longed for. What have you done... This is... rather... nice... The ability leaves its user upon their death. Oh, I've never felt this way before. How my heart races. It isn't the one! What is... Don't open that door. Not that you have the resolve or integrity to do it. You're finally free from the tiger's power. Carry on without it. Don't worry, no one expects a thing from you. I won't listen to you. There's no turning back once you know. You'll find that the door isn't locked. Proceed at your own discretion and then... Die. A fusion ability and a nullification ability. Two opposing powers become one to form a singularity. Obtaining Dazai-kun's ability still leaves what you seek, the memories you've lost, out of reach. Why do you know that!? Worry not. I will fill in the blanks that torment you. That is death. Anything ring a bell? I remember... I know this sensation. The warden misunderstands your ability. Yours is a rarity in this world. It's the one ability other users would desire. But perhaps due to age, that ability remains tucked away and not even my fog can draw it out. Which is why... Come, grant me the pleasure of a surprise. This is... That's right. It's coming back to me. I brandished my claws that day. I brandished my claws that day. I brandished my claws that day. I brandished my claws that day. I brandished my claws that day. - I pushed a button that day. - I brandished my claws that day. I brandished my claws that day. I was told your ability would be desired by all users. By that Russian, Fyodor. You undeniably died that day. And your ability was inherited by none other than yourself as you parted your body. You forgot your own death and created a room with a collection to manage and satisfy yourself with. That is what you currently are. I brandished my claws that day. Indeed, you killed me that day. With those very claws. Of course I had my claws out! I wanted to live! The boy always brandishes the tiger's claws in order to live! It's the beginning of the end. You're so greedy, Dazai-kun. Even in death you seek to watch the end of this city. Let me tell you something in light of our wonderful new friendship. Have you ever wondered why my ability never manifested within this fog? I am crime. And I am punishment. Did you know? Crime and punishment go hand in hand. Boundaries vanish... The room awakens... The personification of demise... The ability-eating lord of the fog. Run wild, feast and howl as your instincts dictate. This is no rampage nor a singularity. The dragon is the original form of the chaos these abilities hold. Abnormal readings from the singularity rising! Five, five and a half times the values from six years ago... It won't stop climbing! What's the status on A5158? Get a grip, flunkey! Chuya-kun. It's likely that Dazai-kun has been killed. Do understand what this means? Doesn't bother me. Are you sure? You have yet to claim my life as your payment. Get off your high horse. Six years ago you were just some lowly mole. No one would've listened to whatever you had to say about Shibusawa, yeah? Just some dude rambling. That dumbass Dazai's in there somewhere. No doubt about it. I won't rest until I sock him. Later. We're counting on you... We'll shortly be above the target. You're that gal from before. The name's Tsujimura. Are you really going? Yeah. You won't make it! You're still human despite your ability. That's a monster beyond our understanding. Your overconfidence will only lead to your death. That's no excuse to turn tail and run. Do you know when you can? I don't. Never. There's no such time. You are the extreme of dark corruption. May you not wake me again! Amazing, it's rising. His ability controls gravity. But once in that corrupted state he is a graviton manipulating avatar, unable to command or cancel it. You mean he'll keep going until he dies? Without Dazai-kun's nullification ability, his fate is sealed. That can't be... Dazai! You used Corruption believing I'd bring you back? I could almost cry. Yeah I believed you. You with your sickening vitality and dirty tricks. You're a rather violent Prince to my Snow White. Says the man who kept an antidote in his mouth knowing a punch to the face was coming. Lemme go. Stay still. Huh? The fog hasn't disappeared. Please spare me from having to protect you from your own ability. You mean it's not over? Yeah. The battle has just begun. Shit, I can't move... a finger. Everything went as anticipated so far. But now... The rest is up to them. You acted like you knew everything when you knew nothing. There's no stopping this fog from spreading, turning this world into a fruit of death, a dead apple. Here's a little present from me. It's a fragment of the ability gathering crystal. This makes you the singularity. I remember everything. What I sought were not abilities but the glimmer of life that shines from defying your ability and prevailing over fate. You showed me that light. Your soul that shone as you tenaciously clung to life by killing me. Let me admire that glimmer once more. The fog has begun to expand its area of influence! Unable to calculate the singularity's fluctuations! Expanding at the speed of 120 kilometers. At this rate all of the Kanto region will be engulfed in 1 hour and 35 minutes. 12 hours and 36 minutes to cover Japan and in 168 hours, the whole world. Seriously? This is... Incoming call from the British Special Abilities Bureau! Esquires of the Clock Tower... Good day to you all. On behalf of the European countries, we offer our sympathies in this pressing time. With that said, to prevent further spread of this fog, we have deployed ability users with the power of incineration. Incineration abilities? How much time do we have? Precisely 30 minutes, at the crack of dawn. Yokohama will be burnt to the ground... You must be Shibusawa. Rashomon! Demonic! Armor! Are you both ability users? Both? Why are you here? I want the one I care for to live in the light. I'll be the one to kill him. Yasha Shirayuki! To think there were two who managed to regain their abilities. We aren't the only ones! Is this still within your expectations, Dazai-kun? Well, I'm in no position to worry about others. I love you, Rintaro. You're too adorable, Elise-chan. I can't slice you up. Now then, what's the best course of action? A swordsman on par with myself. Your skills may be unmatched but your honor dulls you. A sword that lacks a shred of cunning cannot beat me. Fukuzawa-dono? What a coincidence, Mori-sensei. You appear to be in trouble. The solution has just appeared before me. Excellent. This is where one's daily conduct shows through. It appears that scalpels are not all that you wield. I shall make note of that. You show no mercy even to a lovable child. Silver Wolf the lone swordsman, your sins run deep. What I slew was a wicked specter. Dammit, Rintaro! Who let you neglect me to play around? It's the real Elise-chan. She remains wicked all the same. What's this glimmer of life? I have no such thing. I was secretly relieved to have lost the tiger's powers. I was no longer a threat to those around me. The scary tiger and I are separate beings. Except, the tiger did save me before. I have already met with death. How do you kill one who is already dead? Foul ghoul! The tiger and me are inseparable no matter where I run. It's like how you can't escape your own heartbeat. That's because you are my very will to survive. I hear you clearly now. I understand your words. I know that. The flame of their lives burns bright. Right back at you. Dawdle around and I'll leave you behind. Come here! Byakko! I have seen your lives glimmer! However, it isn't bright enough. Whoever paired dragons with tigers was right. The Russian who told me about you said thus. The dragon is the original form of the chaos these abilities hold. You who represent the tiger, are the foe of every ability there is. About time you arrived, fool. Are you going to kill me once more, Atsushi Nakajima-kun? I'm only returning you to where you belong. Let me be clear. I don't hold my death against you. That's the spirit, Atsushi-kun! You really are... Special! I am finally free of my boredom! Shirayuki! We'll never protect where we belong unless we join forces. Can you call Yasha Shirayuki again? Kyoka... Weretiger... I'm sure you know... what must be done. Yeah, I do. Kyoka-chan. Yasha Shirayuki, who you didn't want to hate, will surely respond to your call. Even your innocence is beautiful. Kyoka-chan! Yasha Shirayuki! Your efforts remain futile! Akutagawa! Don't order me around! You're not going anywhere. This is it... This is the one. I am awash with delight. Do you feel it too? What's that? Your glimmer that opposes all abilities... Let me see it once more! Beautiful... This is the ultimate ability. You're wrong! What!? That's no ability... It's myself! I understand everything now. Why I stand here, why you appeared before me, and the words he told me. It's you... You're the angel that brings me salvation. Disappearance of both the singularity and fog confirmed. The Clock Tower esquire ordered for their mission to be aborted. A shame... The scent of a country in flames goes so well with tea. What're you doing here? Dumbass Dazai's fine. Hey. Lend me a shoulder. The fact a regular person like me is back means everything worked out. Atsushi's gotten really good at saving the day. Right, Dazai? Atsushi-kun, the things I did... Dazai-san... You tried to protect the city, didn't you? Do I look like a good guy who'd do that? You do. Whatever. I hope he spent his final moments free from boredom or solitude. Was this what you really want? Much like how I sealed my memory of killing him, I can put that past behind me again. It's for the best. I can take pride in protecting the city with everyone. A life with with you and the Agency is a more wonderful prospect. You there! You numbskulls still breathing? Everyone made it. Of course, we're the Armed Detective Agency. Right? Yes! That this large incident occurred without a single civilian casualty proved to be our silver lining. Ow! Keep working, Tsujimura-kun. We're only on our fourth all-nighter. No way we can keep all this under wraps. Even keeping it to Yokohama alone is hard with all that destruction caused. So... What was this whole case about in the end? I don't know. Three masterminds each played their own complicated game. It's still hard to have a grasp of the ensuing mess. Dazai-kun will tell us nothing and we can forget about getting a read on Demon Fyodor's mind. But when you put aside all plotting and trickery aside, the core of the matter may be surprisingly simple. Huh? An intellect that leaves you unable to sympathize with others. How will Shibusawa, who was cursed with such a mind, act and how will he end? Perhaps he may even be saved... The isolation and solitude those three must feel is beyond my comprehension. Tsujimura-kun? Did you figure out their plan, Boss? If Dazai-kun acts alone then he would require your help. To set the stage, that is. So I was the opening act? It's him who casts the main performers. So what do I get for my troubles? The return of order in the city. You're saying I protected the peace? And I thank you for your efforts. No need to. I'm only doing my job. Everything is for entertainment. Still, it appears I will need that book if I am to end this world filled with crime and punishment. The blank notebook that sleeps in this city. Do not offend the client. Got it? Kunikida-kun, you're like the Agency's mommy. Don't overdo it you two. Off you go. Take care. Well then, we're off.
