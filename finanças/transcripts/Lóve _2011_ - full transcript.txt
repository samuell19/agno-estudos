Hands up! Get down! Open it! Move! Give me the money! Life often gets complicated. The older you get, the more problems you get. Sometimes I like to remember the times when things were simple. When life was a game for us and we didn't want to play by the rules. Just me and Tomáš. Inseparable buddies, from the very beginning. - Looks sweet. - Right? - You said it. - Hey man. - What's up, fool? Fine? Sure. Going to the bar, do you want something? - Excuse me. Take my order? - No time right now. - What was that? - Excuse me. - Excuse me, excuse me! Hello! - I can't right now. Excuse me. I want to order. - What are you fighting for? - A soda, but I obviously can't win. - Why's that? - 'Cause everyone keeps ignoring me. Well, we can ignore them too. - Wanna dance? - What? - I asked if you wanted to dance. - I can't hear you. Mato, the bouncers are beating up Tomáš, you should get out there. - Sorry, but I have to go. - Move. - Let go of me! - What's going on here? He broke a glass table and three glasses. And refuses to pay for it. Bullshit, I didn't break anything important. Can't we just settle it somehow? - Yes, pay up or shut up, smartass. - What did you say to him? Come, come... Where are those fucking assholes? Man, slow down. What the hell was that? I'll never set a foot in that place again. All we can do now is stay home. There was such a hot chick, her eyes! Fuck that, there's shitloads of bitches in the world. Wake up. Light up one for breakfast. You do it. At least hand it to me, it's right next to you. Come on, baby, come here. Fuck. - I want some too. - It’s all gone. You smoked it all, asshole? Just call Pedro, tell him to bring some weed. - Call him yourself. - You wanna smoke. Where's my cell phone? - Hey, cuz. - Hey, man, what's up? - Hi, where are you? - At home, what do you want? Could you bring me three CDs? I have some good stuff for you. You'll dig it. - Cool. When will you get here? - I'll be there in 15 minutes. - So in an hour. Great, see ya'. - Bye. So, let's play one match, man? I'll own you. I take Manchester, you take Liberec. I'm gonna kick your ass. Come on... Go, that's it, that's it. Yeah, go! Sucker, sucker, sucker... Come on. - Hey there. - Hey, man. Get in there. - The rescue team is here. - Hey there, Oto. - Guys, this is such great stuff. - Where's the music? Here's your Bieber, Swift, and Lady Haha. And this is Alice in Wonderland. This dude brought it to me, it's some organic stuff. Me and my bro gave it a test ride yesterday, and it really kicks, we were blotto the whole day. Mind if I stuff one here? You amateur! Dude's got a pull. I used to swim. - Hello. - Hey, where are you? - I'm here, where are you at? - As we agreed. Okay, I'm on my way, wait there. Screw him? If he wants something, he's gotta wait. Moron. I don't like him. Assault Squad... Blázen. Gimme a spark. Let's have some. Guys, let's pack up, we're leaving, gotta go. Job's waiting. - Can I stay a little longer? - Hey, Medicine Man, d'you hear me? - Alright, let me do one more round? - You can run around the house. - Wait, wait, what's that? Get up. - See you, going home. - Bye. - Bye. - See you all next time. - Absolutely. - Sorry, I had... - What? A dick for a head? How am I going to sell it like that? The car's all smoked up, messed up, and fucked up. I already had a buyer. I'm not getting fucked over because of you... - I ain't got time for this. - Boris, I tell you... You got a week to get me a car just like this one or I'll drill you full of holes. Do you get me? Do you get me? You still got one hand left. Now get out and bring me my car. - Hi. - Hi. CAR REPAIR SHOP ENTRANCE ROUND THE CORNER Ah, here are my little bees. - You ready to get busy today? - Sure, as usual. So, you got any work for us today? What do you mean, work? Got a car here, as always, right? A VW. On Antolská, a parking lot in front of the hospital. - Plate number NM099BO. - Okay. See you in a bit. - So, you're the lookout? - I don't care, do what you want. - You should be. - Why's that? The car should be done by the better one. - What? Better what? - You're such an idiot. - Wait, you mean you're better? - Definitely more talented than you. - How'd you figure that out? - I always get the bigger catch. - I always do more than you. - Dude, you're slow, if it wasn't for me, we'd be waiting around for the cops. Hold on, for real. Let's make a bet on who brings better bling in fifteen minutes. - I'm not getting into this with you. - What's wrong? Scared? Let's bet. - Fifty? - A hundred. - In fifteen minutes? - What do you have? - Cool stuff, and you? More than cool. Totally awesome stuff. - It'll blow your mind. - Let's see. - You first, man. - No, you. - Show me. - All right, check this out. - Stereo... - Daewoo? Wallet, credit cards, man. A watch... - And a gold pen. - Isn't that silver? Who cares. Wait, that's not everything yet. - Armani glasses, eh? - That's a fucking knockoff. Dude, why do you take stuff like that? - Well, what did you get? - Watch and weep. - Whatever. - Watch this. A camera... - It’s a GPS. Such a tiny thing. - Looks like a Tetris. Check this out, recognize it? Another one, an Apple right next to it. I think I forgot something. Didn't count it, but there's got to be a grand and a half for sure. - Sonofabitch. Show me. - Alright, give it back. CAR REPAIR SHOP ENTRANCE ROUND THE CORNER I called the chick, the one whose number I got. - Yeah? And? - All cool. She invited us to a dorm party, her roommates will be there, too. We can't go anywhere else anyway, you fucked it all up. I just hope yours isn't the only hot chick there. Well, good morning... I feel bloated like Kelly Osborne. And probably look that way too. - Peta is in the bathroom? - Unfortunately. And, what do you think, did you pass? The exam. I don't think so. Even though I studied, he lets the bimbos pass. They pay him. Oh, god, and maybe not. Just think how long you studied for it. - Want some tea? - Yes, please. Something to wake me up. Look, even if he doesn't let you pass now, so what? You've still got two make-ups, eh? But let's make one thing clear now. Whether or not you pass, we're gonna party tonight. Those cute guys we met last week at that party are coming over. - What guys? - You know, the one with my number. I guess he can't forget me. No guy can ever forget me. Well, he called me. I don't know, I don't feel like going out tonight. No, they're coming over here. We'll have a proper dorm party, like the good book says. Get rid of all the negative energy, chill. It'll be nice. I don't get it, why do you always have to sweat things? What are you doing here? Weren't you supposed to get the results at eight? - What time is it now? - The bundle of nerves speaks again. - Seven thirty. - I don't even have time for a shower. Hell, what a start again! Just use Peta's deodorant. That can cover up anything. You mean I stink or what? INSTITUTE OF EUROPEAN STUDIES AND INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS Oh, an A! Come on in. Sorry, but what's this exercise supposed to do? Hi. Well? How did you do? Ah, I just should have stayed in bed today. Come on, don't sweat it, it's like that everywhere. Girls, come on. Let's forget about this, okay? - We're getting drunk tonight. - What's up? You look tired. Shit, I'm totally beat. I'm going to take a shower. I used to get tired but ever since I started to exercise, my life's changed completely. It's shocking, but this is the first time I agree with you. Niki, you must come along some time. I'm either studying or working. But you have to take care of your body. You realize what kind of guys go there? Ripped. Listen. I go to the gym, and I watch Marian Hossa, okay? - It wasn’t him, but he was cute! - And his stubble, so light and sexy. - No way, he'd have to lose that. - Great stubble, so light, perfect. - And the way he looked at me? - Excuse me? He was looking at me. Niki, you should come with us. You're sure to meet a guy you like. How long have you been single? - Hey, hello. - Hi. - Hi. We're in front of the dorm. Will you come and get us? - Yeah, just a minute. - Okay. She'll be here in a minute. Dangerous protection. - You said it. - Right. Hello, you’re looking good tonight. - Hi, guys. - Hello. Hey, hon. Only two of you? What, not enough? Want me to get more? - How many are you? - Three. That's about right, isn't it? Depends on what you have in mind. Let's not stand around, come. I've got visitors. A cousin from Šamorín, is that okay? Thanks. Ladies? Well, this is Tomáš, that's Veronika, and this is Peta. - Hello, Peta. - Hi. - Hi, I'm Peta. - Hey, Mato. - We've already met. - Where? We know everyone in town, it's no big deal. Well, what are we drinking? Well, we brought something. Pear brandy? It's been a while. I'm so excited. - Cocktail? - I don't feel like drinking tonight. Are you a chick now? So what? I'll just sip and enjoy. That way I'll be fine tomorrow and you'll throw up your guts. When did I ever puke after booze? - Alright, bottoms up. - Cheers. - Bottoms up... The silence is getting embarrassing. Let's try some music. Come. Let me refresh that. Come on. Wait a minute... Drink! Sometimes you are really nasty to me. Peta, got a smoke? Peta, are you okay? - I got some, want one? - Please. - I'll grab one too, if it's okay. - Sure, follow me. - Got a light? - Yeah, I do. But if I remember correctly, you said you didn't smoke. - I only light up when I'm upset. - What are you upset about? - Doesn't matter. - It's alright, I got time. - Did we show up at the wrong time? - No, I'm glad you're here. I just had a bad day. First at school, I failed an exam, and then I ran into one of those silicone dolls at work. - What do you study? - Economics, management. Here in Petržalka? - Why? Do you know anyone there? - Well, yeah. - Who? Pretty ladies with expensive cars and empty heads. Well, that's exactly who messed up my whole day. Don't worry about that. Chicks like that have a short lifespan. Can't compare to you. You don't even know me. Believe it or not, I got a good people radar. I can tell. Really? So, what do you think about me? I think you're the first decent person studying economics I've met. Thank you. Anything else? You like having fun, but you don't go out very often. You're pissed off about failing that exam and you care about your education, that means you're ambitious. But otherwise you're friendly and caring. And that's why we should do something about our friends here. - And I should go check on Peta. - We'll be on our way now. I forgot to ask for your number last time. - So, if you don't mind. - Sure. - I'll call you, for sure. - Okay. You alright? Wait, my sweatshirt. Where are you going? I love you. You drunk pig. Fuck, my head hurts. What's up, big boy? By the way, how did we get here? What do you think, asshole, we took a cab. Had to sweet talk him for half an hour to take you on board. - I've blanked out. - It's better that way. - Where are you going? - I'm thirsty. And... what did we do? You really wanna know? Thought so. Get me some water. But it was alright, wasn't it? Dude, who do you keep messaging? Huh? The girl from last night. Do you hear me? How about this car? The Benzo? Let's do it, alright? - Sure. - Turn on the scrambler then. - Give it to me, I wanna do one more. - Okay. - Wait. That's him, isn't it? - Sure is. At least let him go first. You first, dickhead. Check it out. Oh, shit. - Hey man, whatcha lookin' for? - Yesterday? Move it, let's do another one and get it over with. - You wanna go get laid, eh? - Oh, drop it. She's really sweet. Let's talk in a week, we'll see what you say then. A pretty successful Saturday. Who says Slovaks have no money? Show me what you've got. Nice. Great! You guys made me happy. And when I'm happy, you're happy. Doing business with you is always a pleasure. Sorry, I've got to arrange something. Don't leave, guys, I got something for you. A bigger job. - Yes, hello? - Hi. I'm not sure if I reached... - Yes, you got the right number. - My car is gone, an Audi. - What was your license plate number? - KE539IE. Guys, go see if we've got an Audi here, KE539IE, go. - Hello? - Hold on... - It's here, plain as day. - Yes, it's here. - What can we do about it? - Bring 7 grand. - Excuse me? - 7,000 euros. On Wednesday. - Where should I bring it? - Okay, be ready. Where do I meet you? I'm so happy when lost cars find their rightful owners. Well, guys, it's like this. I need you to pick up one car. Slightly higher class than usual. - You can always count on us. - I know, that's why I'm telling you. It's important to me that this one goes without a hitch. Hey, you got the two best guys here for a clean job. - What kind of car is it? - K1. - K One Attack? Nearly a Slovak classic? Always wanted to ride a car like that. The car will be in a parking lot. I'll let you know where and when. I'll text you the time and priority. - Why all the cloak and dagger? - That's none of your fucking business. Got it? Fine, so, thank you for now and see you. - I'll call and write. Bye. - Later. - See you. It's kinda late. Can you drop me off at Veronika's? - The chick's calling? - Give me a break. Where are you going, lovebirds? To get romantic at the movies? To the mall, please. Sorry I'm late, the bus broke down. We all had to get off and wait for the next one. No biggie, that's typical public transportation. So? Where will we direct our steps to today? - I thought you might have an idea. - Then I know exactly where to go. - Want a drink to go? - Sure. - Red wine and coke? - Can be done. It's awesome up here. It's better in the evening. When it's a little darker. The whole city is lit up then. It's really beautiful. I've always liked this place. The whole world seems small. It's far away from everything. I've never been here. How did you find this place? By accident, and only a few people know about it. I used to come here with Tomáš or by myself. You're actually the first girl I ever brought here. I bet you tell that to all the girls. No, really. You're the first girl to enjoy this view. - Cheers. - Cheers. See, this is what I've been talking about. You were right about my problems. This is the first time in a long time I'm feeling good. I'm feeling good myself. You know how when you've known someone briefly but you feel you've known them your whole life? I do. That's how you make me feel. I was quite happy when you and Tomáš showed up at the dorm. I didn't know who was coming, and I didn't believe I was going to see you again after that party. - Coincidence. - Or destiny. - Possibly... - Can I ask you something? - Sure. That time at your place, Sandra said she was from Trnava but I don't remember where you come from. I was born in Nitra, but I lived in a children's home in Piešťany, and now I'm here. Well, unless I get expelled. I didn't know. - If you have a problem with... - No, I don't mind. - Some people do. - I don't. I've got parents who don't give a damn. Sometimes there isn't much difference. I'd like to meet my mom. Find out what she's like, - what she does, how she lives... - Have you ever tried? They gave me her name at the home and said she lived in Bratislava. Maybe you'll find her one day. When you're least expecting it. And when you meet, she'll see what a beautiful girl she gave birth to. I miss you already. - Night. - G'night... It was a strange feeling. I'd only known her for a short time but I still knew that I'd found my other half. And I wanted to spend all my time with that half. They were great times the memory of which gave me strength for a long while. I don't know. He doesn't give a shit. I think he doesn't want me anymore. If you want, Sandra, I can ask Mato what Tomáš's intentions are. But you shouldn't worry... - What about you and Mato? - I think I'm finally in love. Well, then I hope it works out for you at least. What does Mato actually do? Tomáš doesn't want to tell me how he makes his money. And that guy is always loaded, but I've never seen him go to work. Mato works the front desk at the Sheraton. See. The front desk at the Sheraton. Really? That's great. Have you ever been to see him? - No, why? - Just to see how he's doing... Why are you asking about this? Are you jealous or what? I mean well. I just want to know if he's telling the truth. Mato has no reason to lie to me, I trust him. If I ever feel like it, I will go and see him. When she feels like it, she'll go and see him. You have no idea what love is. You can't even find the Sheraton. - Your shirt's dirty, don't you mind? - No. But I do mind your tea bags, you know I do! Shit, it's half past already? I have to go, that make-up test is today. You know what? If you mind the tea bags so much, throw them out. - And what do you think I do? - Keep plopping mask on your face? You're jealous of my mask, too? You'll never have skin like mine. COMENIUS UNIVERSITY SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC SCIENCES Here... Is this how one arrives for a test, young lady? - I'm sorry, the bus broke down. - Who cares. Put your bag and your cell phone behind you, like all students. Everyone ready? We're waiting for the young lady to take out her cell phone. I forgot it at home. Excuse me? Do you think I'm stupid? Do you think I don't know how it's done? That you download everything to your phones and just copy it? Where is that phone? Get it out. - Where is she hiding it? - I'm not hiding anything, I don't need to cheat. I studied for this, this is my second try. - Her second try. Wonder why? - I'd like to know that too. I did much better than some of your other female students who got an A. You don't have a cell phone? I told you I forgot it at home. Please, pack your stuff and there's the door. - Excuse me? - Without the drama, please. Please, leave. Students, why aren't you writing? What are you looking at? And don't slam the door. Fuck that, damn fucking phone. - Yeah, what's up? - Tomáš? - Yeah. - Hi, is Mato there? - No, Mato's at work. At the hotel? Yeah. He left his phone at home. Want me to give him a message? I'm calling from a friend's phone, I left mine at home too. No need to take a message. I'll just go and see him. - That's not a good idea. - Why not? Because he works really hard. I'll only stay for a moment. I need to see him. - Okay, whatever... - Bye. Bye. Fuck, this is not gonna end well. Fuck! Turn off that shower. - What's wrong? - Veronika called. - I answered. - Why did you do that? - She wants to visit your fake job. - I hope you told her not to. Moron, what did you tell her? That you work at the Sheraton? - What is it you do there? - I hope you told her not to. True love, you say. And you lie to her like that. Tomáš, you listening? You hear me? - I hope you told her not to. - No, you asshole. You know how persistent she can be. I bet she's on her way. - She's on her way there to see me? - Yeah. - And she forgot her cell phone. - Are you kidding me? - Fuck, you're not... - I wanna see you get out of this. Fucking demented moron! Doped up idiot. Fucking socks. - I'm really rooting for you. - Fuck you! Know what I can say to that? Fuck you! Shut the door, asshole. Business class. Room with a view of the castle. - But that will reflect in the price. - That's alright. - How can I help you? - I need a favour. A girl with the mistaken idea that I work here is coming in a sec. What do I have to do with that? I will get behind that desk and pretend I work here, for 10 minutes. I can't help you with that. It's a room number... 400 euros for 10 minutes. Don't regret it later. Could you wait for me in the Lobby Bar, please? - But only for a moment. - Okay. Hold on, one more thing... Give me your jacket. Oh, come on. No time for this. - But just for a minute. - Quick. Thanks. - Good morning. - Morning. - Hey, Mato. - Hey, love. What happened? I know you're busy and I shouldn't really be here - but I needed to see you. - You gonna tell me what happened? I got kicked out of the exam. Excuse me... We left the card in the room, my husband closed the door shut, and we can't get in. I'm barefoot. Oh, I'm sorry. My colleague handles new cards. Follow me, please. - Why did he boot you? - Because I left my phone at home. He wanted us to put our cell phones on the desk behind us. But since I didn't have mine, he thought I hid it to cheat. You're kidding me. Is he nuts? - Excuse me, young man. - Yes? We have no towels and robes in our room. The maid hasn't come yet. I'll take care of it, the maid will come as soon as possible. I don't want to hold you up... Excuse me, I don't think you're paying attention to this. I'm busy at the moment, in case you haven't noticed. You should solve your personal problems elsewhere. If you stopped stealing towels and robes, you wouldn't have a problem. - Excuse me?! - Lady... What did you say to me?! I want you to call the manager, right now! Go ahead, go and find him. Did you hear that? That's outrageous! I don't want to get you in trouble. No, it's alright. What are you going to do? I have one more make-up term, but this guy won't let me pass. I don't know. What is this supposed to mean? Where's Rene? Rene, come here, please. Rene, can you explain this to me? This nice lady came complaining about one of our receptionists. Who is this gentleman? Who are you? You know what? Screw you all. I've slaved here for two years and not only are you still paying me like a temp, you give me Rene's old jacket, don't even get me a new shirt, and on top of it all you're constantly forgetting my name. And at the first sign of trouble, you say you don't know me. You know what you can do with your job? Prestigious work, my ass. There you go. - I'm checking out. - But, this is absurd. I'd be an idiot to stay at this hotel, since you're scamming your guests. - Pardon? - We're leaving! - I'm checking out. Get the bill. Rene... - I'm really scared, Mato. - Don't be. You don't understand. If I don't pass this exam, then I can't pass the semester, and I'm likely to lose the dorm too. What then, where will I go? Come on, baby. It's not that dramatic. Look, I wanted to tell you later. I was thinking about moving out of Tomáš's place for a while now. Why? I have some money saved up, have to find a new job. And then an apartment to move in to with you. You don't have to do that because of me. I'm not doing it for you. I'm doing it for us. - I love you. - I love you too. Sorry... - Sandra? - I didn't mean to barge in on you. Sandra, what's wrong? What happened? I know I said I'd go home for the weekend but... - He left me. - Come here, honey... How can I go home like this? I'd spend the whole time crying like an idiot... Think I'd better go. I need to start looking for a new job. - Okay, love. I'll call you. - Bye. Asshole, careful with the car. - Are you crazy? - You are really sick. What's up, Casanova, broke up with another one? So now she's crying on your shoulder, too? 'Cos I'm not stupid and I know when to finish it, and you should finish it too. You're in way over your head. Know what? Not in the least. I'm totally happy. Give it a month. You're already screwing your buddy over. Oh, please. No tears, alright? - Prove me wrong. - How? What do you want from me? Just like old times. We hit a strip club, have a good time. I broke up with Sandra today, I'm paying. - I don't know. I'm not in the mood. - You're acting like my old man. All you need is slippers and a beer in your hand. A month ago you didn't care if you'd had a girlfriend, you'd still go out to the strip club with me every day. Don't act like the first guy to fall in love. God, okay. Will you stop this if I go? Didn't take long to crack you. Holy shit, you're an idiot. Here. Today's on me. Have fun. It would be great, but I have to go. - So, where's Sandra? - She ended up going home. I spent all day calming her down and now she's decided to go home. At least we've got more space for us. And you? Where did you two go last night? Just out on the town with Tomáš. To toast his failed relationship. I wasn't in the mood, so I left him there and went home to bed. I decided to do an important thing today. What thing? I found the courage to write a letter to my mom. - Hold on, you found her? - I did. I found her address and wrote her a letter. - What did you write? - I said that I'm her daughter, and that I would like to meet her one day. That I'm not angry with her and I'd like to get to know her. - Do you think she'll answer? - Well, all I can do is wait and see. I think she will. - Dunno, I got a hunch. - We'll see, no high expectations. You're not going to answer? That's probably Tomáš, I'm not in the mood. What are we going to do tonight? I'd like to stay here with you. Answer. He might need something. Tomáš? He never needs anything important. Fine. Hello? So you finally decide to answer the phone, asshole. I wouldn't keep calling if it wasn't work. Where the fuck are you? - Out. Why? - The message came, get home. - When? - Get going. Got work to do... - Okay. On my way. - You're such a dick! Do you have to go? Love, I completely forgot. The landlord is coming today. And we both have to be there since we're both giving him the notice. Call me when you're done. I'll go buy some popcorn and rent a movie. Okay. - Gotta go. Bye. - See you. And hurry. Finally here. I called you a million times. Where were you? I got a message from Boris. Tonight, high priority. At 10 p.m. I'm so excited. - Well, where have you been? - I was at Veronika's. Why the long face? Not looking forward to it? Not a bit. I thought about the whole thing and I want to quit. - Find a proper job and a new place. - What the fuck are you saying? We've been waiting for this all our lives! Shall we take it to the next level or not? I don't care about levels anymore. I don't want to live with all this pressure. What pressure? What’re you talking about? What about me? Your buddy since we were kids? You want me to do the job alone? You know I can't do that! You want to screw a buddy you've known all your life for a whore you've known for a month? She's no whore. I finally have something normal. And this has been coming. I'd have moved away anyway. I told you before, you just decided to ignore it! Okay. And how about tonight? You want me to go alone? You gonna screw me over? - Are you gonna have my back? - I'm coming tonight. I won't let you down. I promised you that a long time ago. - What a beauty. - What the hell? - Where are the keys? - In front of the rear wheel. - Where? - The wheel well, idiot. Catch. What was it you said back home? - That this is your last job? - Yeah. Take it for a ride then, if you dare. Careful. - Fuck, how do you climb into this? - Figure it out. Figure it out yourself. - Man, it's like a jet. - Come on, move it. - Shit. No way. - What's wrong? - There's no gas. - Enough to take us to Boris's? - And how if there's no gas? - Stop at the gas station. - Gonna get some in a can. - You think I'm crazy? Want me to go there in a car like this? Okay, no stress. Move it, Boris will be nervous if we show up late. - What's wrong? - I saw someone in there. - Where? - In that white car. - Don't be paranoid. - There's someone in there. Call Boris. - His phone's off. - The other number? - Doesn't use that anymore. Since you're obviously scared shitless, I'm gonna check it out. Fuck! Freeze! Face to the ground! Fuck! So, what were you doing there so late at night? Well, I heard my V-belt squeaking, so I wanted to have it changed. And why are you keeping me here? This is not an interrogation room. You know why? Because there are no cameras here. - Hi. - Hi, honey. I finally found her. I know where my mom lives. I saw her, could we meet? - Yeah. - Are you listening to me? I'm really busy. I'll call later, okay? Bye. - What did they do to you? - Don't even ask, fucking cops. And Boris? No idea. I think we should stop with this now. I guess you're right, but I've got to rest now. Spent the whole night on my feet. - Damn assholes. - Get some sleep. I'm going out. Fuck that, I'm gonna find a real job. There's no future in this. Please, put this out. - Hey, love. - Hello. Sorry about this morning, I didn't know where Tomáš was, he got home beaten up. - What happened to him? - I'll tell you later, let's meet? Okay, what time? - Dunno, in an hour? - Okay, I'll be waiting. - Let's meet at the dorm, okay? - Cool, on my way. - And again, sorry, I love you. - I love you too. Hurry. Okay, later. What happened to Tomáš? Ah, cops were doing a raid against car thieves and Tomáš was passing by, he got caught up in it. Wrong time, wrong place. It happens. But why did he get beat up? They had nothing on him so they at least beat him up. Isn't there something we can do about it? Like what? Sue the police? That's ridiculous. So what about your mom? Any answer? No, not yet. But I happened to be passing by her house yesterday and she was just coming out the door. - Did you follow her? - No. A little, but I was careful. How did you know it was her? She had my letter in her hand. - Do you think she'll answer? - I don't know, but I hope so. But I have a feeling something's going to happen. Something to fix it all. So do I. I have a feeling that my life is about to change radically. It's already started to change. I'm gonna get a new job, even though finding a normal job here isn't easy. And I'll rent an apartment. I already checked some out and there's a clear favourite I want to move into with my love. Really? I told them to keep it on hold for me until next week. - We could go and check it out together. - You can't be serious... I don't believe it. If you like it, we can rent it right away. What about Tomáš? Won't he get mad? No reason to. I’ve told him, more than once. I can't keep living the way he wants me to. Do you really want to do this? Love, I found something other people don't find all their lives. I found my other half. You're stuck with me. I'm so excited. But also worried. Don't be. As long as we have each other and we're in love, we can get over anything. We're here for each other. - I love you. - I love you too. - Don't ever leave me. - Never. How could I leave such beautiful lips? - Stop that. - And such beautiful eyes... - Stop that. - And such cheeks and neck... By the way... Now that I look at you, you're really hot, you know that? Stop that or I'll dump you straight away! I love you. Thanks for walking me home. It's really late. Good night, my love. You can come up with me if you want. There's no one else there, they both left. We could stay together a while longer. I'd love to, but how do I get in? You'd have to go from behind, through a window. - A window? - I'll go and open it for you. - Will you manage? - Go ahead, I'll be there in a sec. - I want you... - I want you too. Good morning, everyone. Room check. Mato, wake up. Mato, room check! - What? - They're doing a room check. - Where are they? - In the hallway. Bye, love. Oh, shit. Fuck. Hey. Hi. I'm taking a smoke. Wait. I was thinking about what you said. Said about what? That we should quit. You serious? The events of the last few days showed me this may not work. I'd like to go solo. Maybe travel the world a bit. See. Glad to hear that. But I don't have enough money. And neither do you. Not enough to rent an apartment for you and Veronika. I know about something that could solve our problems. Something? You remember that gas station we stopped at with the stolen car? - Yeah, you talked to the cashier. - Well, there's this junkie. He's owed me money for years, so he decided to disappear. And then I find him, tending the till at a gas station. Of course he told me he can't pay me back. But he gave me an offer. - Robbing the gas station. - You're nuts. No way. Hold on, not for real. - How's that not for real? - Fuck. You see... there's a safe at every gas station. If we make a deal with him, he'll call us when there's a lot of dough. We'll do a little camera show with him and then pay him off. I don't know. Mato, it's gonna be my last job. If you're not an asshole, you'll be my eyes and ears. You still owe me for leaving me there for the cops... Stop that, you know that's not what happened. Okay. So? Are you in? Fine, but that's the last time. - Where did you get that? - Boris, where else? Well, just in case. I told you, didn't I? - Told me when? - Doesn't matter. What do we need it for if it's just for show? Just in case. Hands up! This is a robbery! - What's going on? - Where's the safe? - Are you nuts, you idiot? - Open up, fast. Move it! Stay put! Move it, you moron! Are you insane? It was such a weird time. Like in a computer game. We had to torch the car, someplace outside the town. At first we didn't even realize what we'd done. We agreed not to meet or call anyone for a while. Tomáš was always out there, arranging stuff, and I sat at home, drinking. I didn't sleep for three nights and days. I didn't have a single missed call from Veronika. She used to call a few times a day and suddenly nothing. After all the sleepless nights I became paranoid and I broke. I had to call her. Can you tell me what happened? Did you hear me? You haven't called for three days. - I've been to the police. - What? Why's that? - What happened? Someone hurt you? - My mom got killed. - What? Oh, god, where? - At work. Are you serious? When? On Sunday, at a gas station. What's wrong? You look pale. Which gas station? The one where you two killed her. I was there and saw it all. I finally found her! Do you get it? I was finally supposed to meet her and now it's all gone! Even though I love you, I want to hate you! I really want to hate you! At the police station, I couldn't tell them it was you! - It wasn't me... - Get out! Get lost! The police confirmed that the car burned in the woods is the same car used by the robbers escaping from the gas station heist last Sunday during which one employee was killed and one had minor injuries. Veronika Huríková, JOJ Television. Why are you sitting in the dark? Why aren't you sleeping? How can you ask me why I'm not sleeping? Because of your stupid, moronic, primitive, fucked up brain. I was out arranging our new life abroad. Maybe your new life 'cause you completely fucked up mine. Stop that, let's just get in the car and never come back here again. Mato, I fucked it up, I wanna make it up to you. You can't make it up to me. It's too fucked up to fix. I know, just give it one more chance. Please! No. I've had enough, don't you understand? I won't spend my life running away from my problems. Know what, I'm going to the police and turn myself in. You've gone completely bonkers in here! They've got nothing on us! Are you nuts? It was a fucking accident, like a million others every day! Do you realize what you're saying? You killed someone. Someone who was loved. Who could have had a family. You have no idea who you killed. What are you talking about? You act like you knew that woman. Did you watch the news today? - What did they say? Come on, spill it! - Understand this! You killed someone, you get it? This isn't a game, this is real! Where do you want to run from this? I at least got the guts to take responsibility for this! But you didn't kill her. Do you realize how much I could get? Twenty fucking years! You want me to do 20 years in jail and fuck up a chance to start over? What's that compared to living with it for the rest of my life, eh? Fucking nothing. And Veronika? My Veronika? She finally found her mother. And you motherfucker killed her all for nothing! You fucked up three lives just like that. And wiped out one altogether. What? Are you saying you went to see Veronika? And you told her everything? God, you're such a dickhead! How can that help anyone? Do you feel like a hero? You were there too. Why didn't you stay and wait for help? Why didn't you call the cops, why? I'll tell you why! Because you're a fucking coward, just like me! And you can't change that! You always got me into trouble. You have one day to get away from here. I'm turning myself in tomorrow morning. Get the fuck out. I don't give a shit about you. Get the hell out, get the fuck away from here! It's me, your mommy. Nah, it's me, Pedro, just kidding. - What is it? - Hi. Tomáš called me, he wanted me to bring something. But Tomáš is not here. He told me to bring more and I don't wanna run around with this stuff. Can I wait for him? How about we roll one in the meantime? - No, I really can't right now. - Oh, come on. All cool, come. You guys going somewhere? - How long? - How the fuck is that your business? Okay. Tomáš told me to bring him two kilos of this weed. - Tomáš is leaving, I'm staying. - Why? Did you have a fight, Mato? - Aren't you a curious little monkey? - Okay, sorry. But the bong is loaded. For you. To chill out. - I'm not in the mood, thanks. - What's wrong with you? Take it. Could come in handy, right? But really, I don't get it. Don't get what? Why Tomáš actually told me to come here when he's gone. I thought you were gonna take this for him. - Me? Take it where? - He called me from the border saying he doesn't have roaming, and that I'm supposed to bring it here. Why did I carry two kilos out here? Am I supposed to schlep it back? I don't understand... - When did he call you? - This morning. Mato? Where are you off to? Mato? Police raid! On the floor! Hands behind your head, legs apart. Look at that fool. - Anything on you? - No, just my wallet! - Are you Matěj Dubovský? - No, no, I'm Peter Hrkotáč. - Where is Matěj Dubovský? - He locked himself in his room! - Are you kidding me? - I give up! - The other hand. - We've got him, coming out. Andrej, come back, they got him. Alright, we're bringing out the suspect. I never heard from Veronika again. But I understand. She probably doesn't want to see me again. Not after what happened. Not a day has passed when I haven't thought about her. She's probably the only thing that's keeping me alive. The thought of how it could have been. There were times when I thought I had it all. There were times when I was sure I had lost everything. I may not be exceptional, and to be honest, I don't know anything. But I do know that only a few people in this place get a second chance. I got mine. And I hope I never mess it up again. Dedicated to all who really love.
