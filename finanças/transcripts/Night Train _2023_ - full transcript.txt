No, no, rest up, sweetheart. I want you ready for that big maple syrup bust. You got the real deal on this coast, baby. Yeah, yeah, how's the snow this spring? Yes, we do, we do have rattlesnakes. You know what? I have a pet rattlesnake and I kiss it, and then I kiss your mommy in her naughty place. Service with a smile. No, no, no, not you. You're not gonna smile again, ever. (phone thuds) (Agent Connolly sighs) Hey, who are you with? Hello? Hey. - Hm, what? - You, who brought in? - Brought me in? - Somebody take care of this perp, please. And locate Field Agent Jackson. - I am Field Agent Jackson. Yeah, I get that a lot. - Well, let's hope looks are deceiving. I'm Case Officer Connolly, this is my office. Get in it. (air whooshing) Jackson, I have a problem, which means now you have a problem. There's a cartel kingpin south of the border. He's a friend because nothing really makes any sense anymore. So, the truckloads of pure uncut cocaine he is trafficking in our country, not a problem. This entrepreneur however, has branched out into black-market medical supplies, and that is not bueno. (fist knocking) - No esta bien. - See, our friend is pissing off some really scary people now. - Who's scarier than the Mexican cartel? - American big Pharma. - Oh. Who do we work for again? - Contraband's already in the country. They don't want it in Vegas. Vegas is a hub. Spreads out from Vegas. Remember the not bueno thing? That's where you come in, 'cause I am told that you like to do a lotta leg work. - You know this is all BS, right? - I do. - Hm. - And I don't care anymore. What about you, Jackson? Do you care anymore? - (inhales) I just spent the last year and a half working the border. It's nearly six a.m. I'm just a tough ol' dog looking for a bone to chew on. I couldn't give a damn. - Well, looks like you're my girl. (pensive music) - Yay, me. (air whooshing) - Oh, hey bud. - Hey, Mom. I made cereal already. - We have milk? - Mm hm. (Holly grimaces) - That's debatable. - Grandma said a curse word yesterday. - Oh, yeah? What'd she say? - I'm not falling for that (laughs). - (laughs) Get your PT's? - [Shelby] Mm hm. - You take your enzymes? - Mm hm. - All right, you get one free pass. - She said dumb ass. - Did she call you a dumb ass or grandpa? - Grandpa. - Well, can't argue with the facts. Ugh, I think this milk went bad a long time ago. - [Shelby] Hm. - You do your homework? - [Shelby] Mm hm. - Okay. - Those came in this morning. (somber music) - I like this shirt on you. - Thanks. - Matches your eyes. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) - Whoa, hey. Hey, doofus, put that down. You're gonna throw your back out. Let me, okay? Oh my God. (Holly laughs) I got it (grunting). - Yo, what's up? - Hey. - Zack Harper. I'm gonna be workin' with you guys. Gonna be a great campaign. - Good to see you. Welcome aboard. - Thanks, man. - Good to have you here. - Appreciate it. - You got everything you need? - [Zack] Yeah, I think we're all good. - All set? - Yeah. - You got it all, everything? - Yeah. - All right. Excited to have you. Ready to go? - Yeah, let's do it. - [Director] Okay, man, good deal. - [Zack] Good, good. - God, I hate that guy. - Great. - Thank you. - Hey, can't wait. - All right, man. - Can't wait. - [Director] Yep. (upbeat music) - Bro, I'm tellin' you, I'm so done with these stupid commercials. It's killin' my image. Should be starring in the movies, not high ho and west in the desert here. It's dry, man. Just get it done, all right? I'm tired of talking about this. (mellow music) - Heads up. You gotta take a bow. - Come on. - Okay. Hear me out. - [Tommy] Uh huh? - I'm thinking, I stay with the compound set up, but get this, with a '72 and a '91. I mean, how cool would that be? - Yeah, really cool, if you like lag. - Mm, not as much as I like boost. What do ya think? You up for installing it? I'll make it worth your while. - I told you already, I don't want your money. Working on a truck like this is all the reward that I need. Besides, I'm startin' to feel like you're an addict and I'm some sort of enabler. - 50/50. Split all racing wins. And that is my final offer and only because you're my best friend. - Because I'm your best friend? - Mm hm. - Okay, look, I'm on to you. You're only offering me half because you want to race twice as often, right? Come on, tell me I'm right. Come on. Huh? - All right, fine, maybe. But is that a yes? (Tommy laughs) (engine rumbling) (mellow music) (mellow music continues) What are you doing? - Thought I heard an owl. It's a bad omen south of the border. Lechuza, they say she's a shape-shifting witch looking for revenge on the people who wronged her. - (laughs nervously) Funny. Okay, can we do this already? - Such a hurry. You want to have a look around the place? - Somebody's got to keep the world spinning. - Yeah. You know, some people would say you're wary of being associated with me. - Hm, a black-market medical supply dealer hiding out in the desert? What could I possibly be afraid of? Besides, you know I roll alone. - I do. A fiercely independent woman. - Fierce. Well, you try dealing with a deadbeat ex who splits as soon as you get knocked up, and not getting a little fierce. - I guess some men just aren't made for manhood. Here, look, a free gift for the kid. Think of this as a reward for all your business. - Uh, Shelby is a boy. He doesn't play with dolls. - Oh, boys can't play with dolls? (Holly laughs) - Look, this is a marionette. - No, that's a puppet, and a particularly ugly one at that. - You know what? Just take it. - You really are the weirdest outlaw in the world, Renzo. - Yeah? - You know that, right? - Okay, well, exactly how many other outlaws are you acquainted with? - Hm, wouldn't you like to know? Thank you. (door creaking) (siren wailing faintly) (Agent Jackson sighs) (pensive music) (glasses thudding) (music continues) (car alarm blaring) - Do I look okay (laughs)? - Breathe. - [Woman Character] Oh, he shot me (laughs). - Big cough. - [Man Character] I think we could work together here. (Shelby coughing) Okay? (woman character chuckles) You know, my enemy's the enemy kinda thing, right? What do you say? - [Woman Character] Am I the only one that stays in my freakin' lane? - [Man Character] Yeah, see, I know where they're goin'. (toilet flushes) (pensive music) (Agent Jackson sighs) (liquid splashing) - Lady, I gotta go. - Mm, uh uh. No, I want you to stay. Come on, yeah. Come on, stay. Come back. Come back and then... That's a good boy. You stay right there. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't move. I just want you to stay and talk to me for a little, 'kay? I just need you to talk to me until the sun comes up and then... (Agent Jackson groans) I need you to, I need you to distract me, okay? I just, uh, can you just be a little bit louder than they are? Can you help me, be just, uh, louder? (upbeat rock music) (music continues) (engine revving) (music continues) (revving continues) - I sent you to school, right? And when I sent you to school, they taught you how numbers work, I assume? - Oh, boy, here we go again. - So, what is higher? 150, or 190? Because right now, I'm kinda hazy on the whole thing because I thought this was a shakedown. I thought we were gonna work our way up slowly on the speed and I thought we had an agreement to keep our sponsor who's been very good to us, happy by not blowin' up the bike they pay us to build or turn it into some shiny lawn dart out there in the desert. - In order for it to be a proper shakedown, you have to be willing to shake things up. - She has a point. - [Holly's Dad] Slow down, girl. - [Holly] Can't hear ya. - I said slow down. - [Holly] I'm sorry, what? Can't, can't hear you. - Slow down. (engine revving) That girl's got the wind up her ass since the day she was born. - Yep. Yep. (anticipatory music) (music continues) - Hello, Miss? Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Hello. Hey, excuse me. Excuse me. Ma'am? Hello? Hey, you just can't walk in here. These planes are worth billions of dollars. - Right, I wouldn't wanna ruin a billionaire's day, especially the local TV evangelist. - Can we discuss this in my office? - Well, as far as I'm concerned, this is your office. - Look, I don't know who you think you are but you have no jurisdiction in here. - Actually, I do. You see, you're regional. That means TSA and CPP, they can't get in the way. (chuckles) It's funny, I actually competed in farmyard teenage beauty pageants that had a tighter managerial hierarchy than this glorified desert lunchbox. - Screw you. I'm calling head office. - How 'bout this? I'm grounding everything that's pointy, expensive and has two wings until I inspect it front to back. - You're just mean. - If I were you, I'd get lost. That is, of course, unless you would like to make things personal. - Bitch. - (smirks) Atta boy. (anticipatory music) (music fades) (keypad beeps) - Shelby, we're ready for you. (solemn music) - Hey, Carol, how you doin'? - I'm good, thanks. Listen, we've got a- - I know. I'm behind on bills. - Way behind. Look, all you have to do is pay something each month. Any amount, all right? Just to show us you're making an effort. That's all. - Yeah, I can do that. ♪ I want ♪ ♪ Ah ♪ ♪ I want ♪ ♪ What ♪ ♪ I want ♪ - Uh oh.

No, no, no, don't, don't tell me there's no meds. - I saved what I could for ya. I know it's not that much, just take it. Keep the money, keep the money. Just take it. - You're gonna get a new supply in, though, right? - I don't know. I don't know. All the local pilots are freaking out right now. If I can't get supplies to Vegas, I break this chain, everything stops, all right? I'm telling you now so you can make other plans. - (scoffs) other plans. What other plans? I can't afford legal meds. And you're my only hookup. - All right, just give me one week. Stay in contact and I'll do my best to figure something out. It's the timing that's the problem here, okay? There is a three-hour window to move everything and that's it. The deal implodes. Don't give up on me just yet, all right? We'll figure it out. (pensive music) (upbeat music) - That is a fuel pump rod stuck in the block all right. (sighs) All right, great. - Oh, it wouldn't be a proper job, Tommy, unless a two-minute job turned into a two-hour job. - Mm hm. (glasses clinking) - You can work it out? - Let's see. - At least we get to spend some time together for once, huh? Because Shelby's been spendin' a lotta time with his grandma lately. - Yeah, I've been pullin' a lot of overtime, Dad. I have to get these hours in. - And you will. I'm gonna get you into the union if it kills me. - Teamsters union has the best medical packages. You got to compete, though. I mean, with the whole gig economy and all that. - That's what they're calling it. Well, as long as it's all legit, right? Nothing illegal? Because I wouldn't want you two out on the street racin' for pinks or anything stupid like that. - Yeah, um, because that would be very stupid. - Super stupid. - But hey, you know, at least we're not doing the old Silver Trails 300 anymore 'cause that was really sketchy. - What's the Silver Trails 300? - Don't ask, Dad. - Okay, then, I won't. I think we can probably pry this out with a ring spanner, Tommy. It's an old trick I used to use in big-box Chevelle's. - All right. - You know what a ring spanner is? - (laughs) Yeah, I know what a ring spanner is. - You have a ring spanner Tommy? - Yes, I have a ring spanner. - Why don't ya go get it? Now. Thank you. (upbeat music playing) Hey, are you okay? - I'm good. No, I just figured out what we needed. - [Holly's Dad] What? - More beer. - Now you're cookin'. - Pop. - That is why she's the brains of the operation and you and I are not. (Holly laughs) (lid pops) (air whooshing) (phone ringing) (pensive music) - Go for Jackson. - Jackson, Connolly. Listen, I was just calling to tell you, you're doing a great job with the planes. Surveillance says that the runners are refusing to move product. I'm impressed. - Listen, the smugglers will be back up and running before you know so don't you worry. - Yeah, about that, I just got a call from up top and apparently we're being a little too effective. We're interfering with our friends' other operations. I'm gonna need you to slow down. - Listen, I haven't even gathered any evidence yet so I'll slow down once I know this thing is shut down. - You'll slow down right now like I just told you to. That is in order. (boxes thudding) What the hell was that? - A box. Um, a box just fell. Okay. I'll get the paperwork gathered up for you then. - Good. You do good work. You're an asset. (engine rumbling) (anticipatory music) (window thuds) - Jeez, Renzo. You scared the hell out of me. - You're the one showin' up unannounced. - Got any bourbon in there? After that I could use a stiff drink. - You should probably call before you visit. - Well, I'm sorry to intrude but I have a proposal for you. About a year ago, we were working on this set with some really shady investors from Vegas. They would have us run things back and forth from there overnight. People, packages. We never knew who or what we were moving. We just knew not to ask questions and not to get stopped by the cops. We had this system going. It was called the Silver Trails 300. You have Route 62, we head east, swing up, 95, all the way to Vegas. 300 miles. - Okay. Five hour drive, give or take. - If you're playing by the rules, yeah, it's about five hours. But what most people don't know is there's a gap in the state police shift change at the border. You time it right, run it like you mean it the whole way, average three digits, no pit stops, you can make it in three hours and the cops'll never know you were there. - You're suggesting you run my contraband up the highway? - If it frees up this chain and keep things moving, then yes. Unless you have a better idea? Because right now, it's my little boy's life on the line. - I respect that, okay? But there is a massive flaw in your plan. You wanna move a package, a person in a sports car, that's easy, okay? But we're talking about a weighty amount of product here. - Hm. Let me give you a tour. 650 horsepower to the wheels. Over 1,000 foot pounds of torque. Fuel tanks take the best of 50 gallons easy. She'll run low elevens all day long even in the midday heat. Oh, check this out. Load her up with five tons, she'll just lay back, cackle and pull even harder. - Well, she's anything but inconspicuous. - Oh, I'm not done yet. I don't like getting any attention I don't want. On the streets, they call her the Night Train. Personally, I like to call her Black Bess. - Dick Turpin's horse? - (chuckles) What can I say? I like my highwaymen. Look, I want my fuel covered and I want the meds I normally receive for free. I'll get your medication to Vegas and I will make planes look slow in the process. - You're making it really hard to say no. - Then give me a yes. - Meet me on the access road by the wind farm. (anticipatory music) Keeps the sky clear of any helicopters. Speak to no one. My men'll know the drill. - [Holly] Will they be armed? - [Renzo] Assume everyone you meet over the next 24 hours is armed. I wish I could go with you but Vegas has far too many cameras. - [Holly] I think I'll be okay. I've done this a million times. - [Renzo] Not for people like this. When you get to Vegas, you head to the loading dock at the Westgate Hotel. Our contact loves to live the high life. Again, talk to nobody. You'll be given the money in a bag, you take it and you head straight home. (dramatic music) Be careful. (music continues) (train rattling) (music continues) (music continues) (mellow music) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) - Whoa! (music continues) (fist knocking) - Mr. Maxwell wants to speak to you. - I have to get back on the road. - It's nonnegotiable, honey. (mellow music) (music continues) (crowd chattering) (dice clattering) (all cheering) (Mr. Maxwell laughs) - Yes! - Somebody wanted to see me? (pensive music) (air whooshing) (gentle classical music) (Mr. Maxwell sighs) - I'm not a man who likes to mince words. I like to tell it like it is. I like country girls. Y'all are a different breed. Women here, they're like blowup dolls with a pulse. So, I was wondering if you might wanna hang out, make a little extra, have some fun? Hm? - (exhales) I'm just here to drive. And I have a really long night ahead of me, so I... - Can't blame a man for asking, right? (Holly smirks softly) By the way, I wanted to give you this, a bonus. We were in a tight spot and I understand that you did the impossible. Consider it a personal thank you from me. I also wanna give you my cell number in case you run into any trouble, or if you change your mind. - Thank you. - Hm. - Wait, I'm sorry, I'm gonna need you to repeat that. - I said we just received word, another shipment has reached Vegas. - Well, I hate to say I told you so. - Not as much as I hate to hear you say it. You're back on, Jackson. - Yeesh, I'm pullin' on so many U-turns here, I'm beginning to think that I'm competing in NASCAR. - We got a leak on the receiving side. Apparently, the shipment came in at night via train. - Via train? I'm not sure that adds up. Well, looks like I'm goin' on another wild goose chase. - Okay, then, you do that, and Jackson, lose the attitude. Things change when the information does. You should know that by now. - And you should try to find someone else who's willing to run around the desert doing your dirty work. Better yet, maybe you should go after a big dog on your own turf rather than barking at little ole me. - Just get it done. (pensive music) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) - Hey, can I ask you a question? I bet with the beast like that no one ever gives you crap on the road, huh? - Yeah, they do tend to see me coming. - Hm, I should upgrade. Must be a real bitch on gas though, huh? - Well, she drinks diesel but yeah, she gets pretty thirsty. (sighs) Long night? - Long night, long day, long week. - Yeah, tell me about it. (music continues) (mellow music) (music continues) (anticipatory music) (engine rumbling) - Good morning. - It's afternoon. Why are you just getting up? - Because Mommy's life is an unmitigated disaster, okay? - [Shelby] Okay. - You like your doll then? - Yeah, it's cool. - Grandma still alive? - Then we're doin' okay. I love you. - I love you, too. (engine rumbling) - Hey, got any extra rifles layin' around? 'Cause I kind of feel like Tony Montana. - Yeah? Well, don't get too excited. This is only temporary, remember? - Wow, way to be a buzz kill. You saying I can't handle it because I'm a girl? - If anything, you're a natural. I just don't wanna see you become a fully-fledged criminal. - Well, you're not wrong there. Turns out I am so good, Mr. Maxwell gave me a bonus. Handed it to me himself. - You took money from Mr. Maxwell? - Yeah. (Renzo sighs) (pensive music) Why are you looking at me like that? Did I do something wrong? - Come here. (music continues) What he's done is he's bought you. He's gonna expect something in return. Nothing in life comes for free. Every favor comes with a debt. Every criminal act, subject to karma. Just how it is. - Hm. Shelby came for free. - Your boy? - Mm hm. Yeah. He's my little miracle baby. I was told I was never gonna be able to get pregnant, and it broke my heart. It was the last thing in the world I expected. Shelby's dad didn't want me to keep him. But I mean, how do you turn down a gift like that? - Maybe I'm wrong. I mean, he's proof. I hope he is. Seems to me that's all the more reason you both need to be kept safe.

So, uh, you're full of crap. - Are you sure you're looking for conversation or are you looking for an argument? - Honestly, I'd be happy with either. - Okay. Well, power is a factor of efficiency.

Wait here. (anticipatory music) (music continues) Your stuff wasn't stolen, doofus. It was hidden. She was trying to protect you. - (scoffs) My personal items? (Zack sniffs) - I don't know anything about that. You know what? We're done here. We're finishing this commercial without you. (Zack laughs) - You can't do that. - Watch me. I've been waiting for an excuse to fire your ass from day one. And hey, I bought that jacket myself. - [Zack] That's mine. - [Tommy] Escort this jackass and get him off the set please. - Hey, congrats on your Pinto commercial, Spielberg. I hope it's a hit. (director sniffs) (mellow music) (music continues) (engine rumbling) (energetic music) (music continues) (music continues) - [Radio Operator] Try to sneak one more and then let's see a little more (speaking faintly). (radio beeps) (energetic music) (music continues) (alarm beeping) (siren wailing) (upbeat music) (music continues) (engine revving) (music continues) (tires squealing) (music continues) (siren wailing continues) (tires squealing) (music continues) (Holly exhales) (music continues) (indistinct radio chattering) (radio beeps) (music continues) - [Man] Boss wants to see you. (anticipatory music) (music continues) (line trilling) - [Shelby] Mom? - Hey. How you doin'? - [Shelby] I was sleeping. - I know, I just needed to hear your voice. - [Shelby] Where are you? - I'll be home soon, bud. I'll be home soon. (mellow music) (dispatcher chattering faintly) (music continues) - [Agent Jackson] It's you. - Thanks, buddy. I owe you one. (Agent Connolly sniffs) (Agent Connolly exhales) (Agent Jackson sniffs) You on a stakeout? You undercover? Under the influence. - You know, you're a real piece of work. (chuckles) Yeah. You see, you got one person working alone with no resources, no leads that actually go anywhere. And now (chuckles) I have to search every pickup truck. (Agent Jackson chuckles) (sniffles) And boy, do we love our pickup trucks. (sighs) You are asking me to do the impossible. And to top it off (chuckles), you can't even decide what that impossible thing is that you want. - Well, that's a sob story. - I just work and work and work. I just can't lay down roots. I can't make friends, and for what? (laughs) To help people? The people that I want to help can't be helped. They're just a lost cause, chronically self-destructive (laughs). - Hey, there's somethin' you know about. Self-destructive behavior. I mean, look, I'm not makin' fun of PTSD. That's something serious. Yeah, I know about your little incident. I read it in your psych evaluation. Ooph. - You don't know what went down. (sighs) We knew that the insurgents liked to pose as civilians, okay? We knew that. You know? (sighs) We thought we had good intelligence. They told us not to leave any witnesses. They said, they said that was an order. - That's right. It was in order, and you follow your orders. That's what you do. You think you're the only one who's figured out their working for the machine. Yeah, I sleep fine at night. - You don't have to look them in the eyes every night like I do. - Yeah, there it is. That's my girl. What is that, huh? Hm? Guilt? I don't see it that way. I think you love it, I think you need it. I think you want it because that's the only feeling that you even can feel anymore. Dead inside. Oh, I can trust the guilt. That's why you work for me. And it ain't the paycheck. (Agent Jackson laughs) Or are you just scared? 'Cause I mean, who's gonna want a washed up old vet? I do. I do. (Agent Jackson exhales) We're gonna have a nice long relationship, me and you. You know, town's, uh, it's that way. (Agent Jackson's tongue clicks) (pensive music) (tires squealing) (music continues) (phone ringing) (Holly sighs) - Look, I got your letters, okay? I'm working on it. I will get you the money as soon as I can. I have to get back to work. (phone ringing) You'll get your money, okay? - [Mr. Maxwell] Oh, I don't want your money. You know what I want from you. So, when are you gonna pay me another visit? - How did you get my number? - Oh, I have my fingers and a lot of pies, Miss McCord. I hope I see you again in Vegas soon. I do so miss the smell of the country. (glass clinks) (upbeat music) (pensive music) (Holly sighs) (music continues) - Mom? Shelby? - [Renzo] Taking care of that nasty bear. - [Shelby] Yeah, you nasty bear. - [Renzo] Wait, no, he's not quite dead yet. - [Shelby] Okay. - Shelby, go check on grandma, please. (anticipatory music) - Hey. - What are you doing here? - I did the math and you're due to run out of antibiotics today so- - So, call. - (sighs) Come on. I called. You weren't picking up. Look, he needs his medication. So- - So you just come into my house? - What do ya want me to do, wait outside? I'm a wanted man. You know that. - How did you even know where I lived? Oh, you had your boys follow me home, didn't you? - Have you taken any more money from our mutual friend? - Okay, listen, I appreciate you stopping by and playing happy little family with my son. I've hitched my wagon to wild horses before and I've learned that they always break free. Please leave. When there's business to be done, I'll contact you. - You know what? Bad debts never take care of good debts. Maybe it's you who's the wild horse. (pensive music) - (grunts) There we go. (Tommy's head thuds) Ow. God! Ah! - Tough day? - Is there any other kind? - [Agent Jackson] Hm. - What can I help you with? - [Agent Jackson] You guys tune diesel engines here, right? - That we do. We tune pretty much everything except for pianos here. - Word on the street is you're the hottest tuning shop in the state. - I don't know about that but, yeah, we try. - Huh. Let me ask you a hypothetical. Could you take a truck that can carry, say, four, maybe five tons and soup that thing up so it goes a 100 miles an hour for three hours without stopping? Not even to refuel? - That is a very specific request. Uh, but, yeah, anything's possible. Can I ask why? - Well, I'm just asking questions. Theorizing. - [Tommy] Theorizing. - Postulating. You know how it is. - Yeah. I know exactly how it is. (clicks tongue) Anyway, uh, you are on private property. Unless you want to arrest me, you gonna arrest me? No? Okay, then I guess I don't have to answer anymore of your dumb ass questions. So, why don't you get lost and come back when you have some sort of warrant or somethin'? (music intensifies) - [Agent Jackson] I'll see myself out then. (music continues) - Look at my castle, Princess. Case closed. (dramatic music) - Now remember what I said, we're gonna start off at 150, 1-5-0. And we're gonna bring the speed up from there provided she's steering on your fingertips, okay? Understand? You can give me the stink eye all you want, girl. You know I'm right. We start out slowly. We're going to finish up much faster. Well, look who showed up. - I got a flat. - You ride safe. (engine revving) - When you have a sec, we need to talk. It's about work. (revving continues) (upbeat music) (revving continues) (music continues) - [Holly's Dad] Come on girl, slow down. Slow down. Wait. (revving continues) (music continues) - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Go, go, go, go!

(Holly's Dad exhales) Cuts and bruises. You crash your bike at 200 miles an hour and you walk away with cuts and bruises. I don't know how you do it, kiddo. - Does that mean I'm discharged? - No. They still want to run a few checks, do a brain scan I think, make sure you still have one in there after your little tumble. So, you and me, we need to have a conversation. The bike's a mess, but you can bang metal back into shape. People (sighs), not so much. I was thinking, remember your first go-cart? - Dad, not this story again. - (laughs) You were eight years old. We spent months building that thing and on the day that we finished, you take it to the steepest hill in town. - The steepest hill in the suburb. You always exaggerate. - It was the steepest hill in town and you proceed to crash it into a tree trying to prove to some kid that you were the fastest. - He was a bully. His fat ass needed to be taught a lesson. And remember, I crossed the finish line first. And maybe if someone had put a shoot on, I would've slowed down. - Oh, so that was my fault. I'm sorry. - I'm not a kid anymore, Pop. - No, I know you're not. But you're still the same person. Nothing's changing that. Nothing should change that because age takes the edge off of ya. Makes you less curious, less, I don't know, I guess it keeps ya from doing stupid stuff, I guess, but I kinda forgot who you are. Tryin' to be a protective parent and all that, I forgot that you are my daughter. You're born to run. It's in your blood. And I just want you to know, Holly, I'm not standing in your way any longer. You didn't crash and burn today because you pushed it too hard. You crashed because the world can't keep up with you. And that's the way it should be. That's how we make a difference. That's what makes some of us pioneers, and some of us just sticks in the mud. - You have no idea how much it means to me to hear you say that. - Believe me, I do because I have fallen into that trap of slowing down way too much myself. (air whooshing) (pensive music) (music continues) (siren wailing) (Holly sighs) (music continues) - Hm. (chuckles) You look like you could use a good cup of coffee right now. Why don't you follow me?

You see, I have you on a security camera in Vegas, and I have a witness placing you on the set of a commercial here just a few hours earlier. You're running the contraband up Route 95 in the dead of the night and you're running it fast so you don't have to deal with any of the law enforcement (chuckles). I got you. ♪ This guy is restless ♪ - You got something. Maybe I took a plane to Vegas. Or maybe I clicked my heels together and got picked up by a tornado.

You know, sick kid and all. (contemplative music) - I don't trust contracts written by other people. Too much small print allowing them to back out. - Hey, I don't blame you with that bureaucracy BS. I sure don't. Gum? - No. - That's half the frustration with being out in the desert, you know? It feels like the old West, but it's not the old West. (pensive music) I long for the simple days, you know? When I, as the sheriff of the town, I wouldn't need to do all this paperwork to handle a problem like you. I would just need a revolver and a bullet. - You need to stop blowin' hot air up your tight little ass. Yeah, back then it was simpler. You got that right. But back then, the sheriff was on the side of the people. Today you just work for corporations. And if the world was right and you were serving up justice, you wouldn't be chasing after people like me. And regardless of the era, it's always harder to hit a moving target. So, come catch me if you can. (Agent Jackson laughs) (pensive music) - Okay. Well, see ya 'round, I guess. - I guess. (music continues) (Holly exhales) (dramatic music) (Agent Jackson spits) (music continues) - [Renzo] They say she's a shape-shifting witch looking for revenge on the people who wronged her. - [Agent Jackson] The only reason I'm not arresting you is because in the grand scheme of things, you're worth diddly squat in the case like this. - [Mr. Maxwell] So, when are you gonna pay me another visit? - [Renzo] Nothing in life comes for free. Every favor comes with a debt. Every criminal act, subject to karma. - [Holly's Dad] You're born to run, it's in your blood. I'm not standing in your way any longer. - Shelby, get your meds! (energetic music) Shelby, come on. Get in. Go. Put your seatbelt on. Seatbelt on? - Uh, almost. - Put it on. (music continues) (music continues) (Holly's Dad grunts) (door slams) - You look like you're in a hurry to get somewhere you don't wanna go. - Yeah, we need to wait for awhile. - What did you do? - The right thing. - (sighs) Now you're paying for it. - Dad, I need to know Mom's gonna be okay. - (scoffs) You just run and leave me with a pretty tough job, don't ya think, Hol? Does this mean you and the boy are gonna be spending more time together? - Yeah. - But you'll be just fine, Holly. - I don't know if I need to go right or left, forwards or backwards, but this isn't workin' for me here, Dad. - It's not working for a lot of people, Holly. (sighs) Listen, kiddo, you gave it your best shot and I'm sorry it's all uphill for your generation. But you do whatever you need to do to even out the playing field, hear me? - I guess we'll (sniffs) keep in touch. - Okay. You know, I told myself I came here for some spare parts but I really think I came here looking, I really think I came you're looking for the man I used to be, Hol. And I'd rather lose you for six months then have you lose your edge forever because the last thing I want is my little girl slowing down. - I'm gonna go faster than you've ever seen. - And I'm gonna be cheering for you. (sniffs) For both of you. (Holly's Dad sighs) (sniffs) You know, Hol, ditch the 'burb soon as you can. It just don't suit you. - Deal. (solemn music) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (music continues) - Hey. I'm gonna ask you something and you have to be straight with me. - Always. What? - If I can't keep running meds, what happens? - As long as there's demand, the vacuum fills. If not by me than somebody else. Do you wanna quit? Is this because of what I did? Because I'm sorry. Listen, I know I crossed the line- - No, Renzo, this has nothing to do with you. I kept taking the money and now the feds are on to me. - So, you're leavin'? - Yeah, we're headed straight for the border. Do you know if you can- - Get you meds in Mexico? Yeah. Look, I can make sure Shelby gets the best healthcare he's ever had in his life, okay? But there's no way you get through a checkpoint if you're on a wanted list. Wait right there. - Good, bud? No, no, no, Renzo, I can't. I don't know how to use it. - I know, I know, you don't have to. I'm going with you. I can show you a way through and I can protect you. - You don't have to do this after what I said to you. - Truth be told I'd have done this the day I met you. All right? Let's go. - Hey, you were right. I am the wild horse. - I know. (door slams) (engine rumbling) - Seatbelt on? - Yeah. (anticipatory music) (music continues) (phone ringing) (music continues) - Connolly. - You are not going to believe who I'm tailing right now. Renzo Romeo. - You're on Renzo Romeo right now? - (sighs) He's on a nice little road trip with almost no protection. I mean, do you have any idea how long I've been searching for this guy and then boom, like that, he's in my lap? - Yeah, okay. Hey, keep tabs on him. I'm gonna make a phone- - Tabs on him? No, I've got a team ready to go if these guys even think of heading to Vegas. - Jackson, listen to me, you are not to lay a hand on Renzo Romeo until I give you the all clear. Is that understood? I have to make a phone call. There are politics involved. - Oh my God, I am so sick of hearing about the politics. Just let me do my job. - And you let me do mine! You listen to what I tell you to do. You follow my orders, you grunt! - Tommy? - [Tommy] Over here. (solemn music) - Tommy? What happened? Shelby, please, go look at the bikes. Are you okay? Wow. - We haven't met yet. - Renzo. - [Tommy] Renzo. - Tommy, we have to get you to the hospital. Who did this? - Some heavies. Showed up asking about you. They said they wanna send a message. Needless to say I might've had something to say about that. - You're the best guard dog a girl could ever ask for. You know that? - Those were Maxwell's men. Looks like you got two bounties on your head now. - I'm under the impression that you might be in a spot of trouble (coughs). - You could say that. I think we're gonna lay low in Mexico for awhile. - Oh, yeah? I'll have to come visit once I feel better 'cause I think you owe me a truck load of tacos and beans. (Holly laughs) Ow. Yes, please. - If they were here looking for you, why did they feel the need to leave so fast? (tires squealing) - I have to go. - Then go. - I love you. - I love you. - [Holly] Come on. - I love you. - I'm waiting. We literally have them surrounded. - You're good to go. Light 'em up if you have to. - There's a kid in there. - Mm hm. How terrible. (dramatic music) (door bangs) (horn honking) (tires squealing) - Night Train, bitch (laughs). - Secure the area. I'm on them. (dramatic music) (music continues) - [Holly] Hang on, Shelby, okay? Hang onto something. (music continues) - Okay. Please, tell me that was intentional, yeah? (music continues) (music continues) (Agent Jackson grunts) - Sorry, Officer. Foot came off the brake. - Thanks, Dad. (engine revving) (energetic music) (music continues) What the hell is that? - It's Maxwell's men. Go, go. - Shelby, get down on the floorboard, okay? I need you to stay down. You gotta stay on the floorboard, all right? (engines revving) (music continues) - He'll kill us out here. Come on. You okay, kid? Stay down. (revving continues) (music continues) - Hold on, Shelby. (revving continues) (music continues) (revving continues) (revving continues) (revving continues) (music continues) (revving continues) (music continues) I can't outrun that. I can't out run it. (gun cocks) - Keep it steady. - Shelby, stay down, okay? (revving continues) (music continues) (shots firing) (engine revving) You okay? Are you okay? (pensive music) (Holly panting) (Renzo panting) Well, you did say you'd get us to the border. - I'm not stopping there, all right? I'm comin' with you. - You wanna hitch your wagon to this? - If you'll let me, yeah. - Well, prepare for your life to get a whole lot wilder. - (sniffs) I can handle that. (pensive music) - Oh, that's bad. (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) (music continues) - Seems, uh, seems you underestimated me, huh? You see, I've been staking out this rat hole for over a year in the hopes that maybe, maybe one day this guy would pop up. (smirks) Look at you two. It's wild how things come together, ain't it? - It is. Why don't you keep that gun on me, huh? - Not a problem, Renzo. Oh, let's be honest, you're not much of a threat, are you? - Try me. - I read every report we have on you and you've never actually had the guts to kill anyone. - And yet here I am, top of your most wanted list. - Yep, here you are. You're a smuggler, okay? You wanna kill gang bangers, have at it. You'd be doing me a favor. You start messing with the economy, though, we got a problem. - Listen, I'll come with you right now and they walk, all right? - You care about their safety now? Is that right? How about this? You don't do contracts, I get it. But you and I, we can still make a deal. You testify that this guy forced you into this and I give you my word you will be looked after, new identity, house, everything the kid needs, all taken care of. What do ya say? - I can do better than that. - [Agent Jackson] Oh, yeah? - You know, I've been thinking, you and I, we're kinda the same. You're tired, too, right? Because I'm exhausted. We're both running as hard as we can. The only difference is that I'm running towards something good, and I get the feeling that you're running away from something bad. - (sniffles) Wow. All right, you got me there. - I can give you a bigger fish, somebody that's actually worth chasing. And you said it yourself, I'm a nobody. I'm diddly squat in this case, remember? And you mean to tell me that you signed up for this job so that you could chase somebody smuggling medical supplies? - Wow. (exhales) That is a hell of a lot of psychoanalyzing you got goin' on there. Who are you offering? - Stay here. Maxwell. - Mm. Interesting. What ya got for me? - Are you gonna let us pass? - Maybe, it's hard to say without seeing the goods first. - I want something from you. - [Agent Jackson] Hm. - I wanna know what it is that you're running from. - (laughs) Did this just become a therapy session? Is that what's happening? - Do you want Maxwell or not? (pensive music) - (sighs) I executed a family in cold blood and I'm not proud of it. (sniffs) They told me I had to do it because they messed up. They had bad intelligence. So, an innocent family had to die at my hands and I get to look at them every time I close my eyes. (Agent Jackson sniffs) Oh, damn it! There ya go. You happy now? - This is my son, Shelby. He's my everything. And by laws of science, he shouldn't exist. But here he is. Nobody can explain it to me but I have my own little theory. I think that when something innocent is killed, something pure takes its place. And it might help you to see it that way, too. (soft music) (Agent Jackson gasps) Oh, damn. (Agent Jackson exhales) This is (sniffs), this is pretty embarrassing (sniffs). (Agent Jackson groans) I sure hope whatever you have on Mr. Maxwell is worthwhile. - I've been going through people's trash my whole life. So, trust me when I say I know where to find dirt. (music continues) (Agent Jackson panting) (music continues) You did good, girl. You did damn good. Come on, bud. Hey. Give him hell. (pensive music) (Agent Jackson sniffles) (music continues) (music continues) - [Agent Jackson] Connolly. (music continues) (music continues) (gentle music) - So, full disclosure, I kinda planned to cross the border with ya, so I called ahead. - Now, that's cool. - How'd I do? - You did good. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Ugh, so not cool. (gentle music) (music continues) - Okay (laughs). (doors slamming) (Holly sighs) I was thinking maybe we could slow things down a little. - Never gonna happen. (engine rumbling) Ready? - Ready. (singing in Spanish) (upbeat Spanish music) Oh, yeah. (singing in Spanish) (upbeat Spanish music) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (singing continues) (music continues) (music continues) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio) (no audio)
