What have you done to my hat, Winkle? How can I face Ms. Rachel? I am disgraced, sir! Tupman, old friend, I shall make good your hat and coat. Thank heavens you're alive.

Must see to that arm of yours, Tupman. Ah, the romance of it all. Gallant gentlemen cut down in the midst of rooks. Excellent subject for an epic poem, perhaps one to rival that of the great Dingle.

(clears throat) Now, my good man, what we want to know is who have you staying in this house at present? Who there is in this house? Well, uh, there's a wooden leg in number six, a pair of Wellington boots in number two, -um-- -Nothing more? Well, our latest arrivals were a pair of black boots, a good deal worn, and a pair of ladies shoes. What sort of shoes? -Country make. -Hmm. Any maker's name? -Brown. -It is them! By heavens, we've found them! And the black boots have just returned from the city and are now with the shoes in number five. Show us the room, and this is yours. You! You're a nice rascal, aren't you? My dear, sir, calm yourself. Consider defamation of character, action for damages, calm yourself, sir. How dare you drag my sister from my house! Sir, I-- Why the devil are you meddling in this, Tupman? This is none of your business. Well, my dear sir, you are quite mistaken. I had many years experience at the bar, and I take great pleasure in representing my friend, Mr. Wardle. Be careful how you speak, sir. You scoundrel! I'll--I'll ruin you! Ha! You, Rachel, at a time of life when you ought to know better! What do you mean by running away with a vagabond, disgracing your family? Get your bonnet. We are leaving. Do nothing of the kind. Leave the room, sir, no business here. Lady free to act as she pleases. More than one and twenty. More than one and twenty? More than one and forty! Ah, I am not! You are! You're fifty if you're an hour! (Rachel screaming) Cad, sir, cad. A glass of water for the poor woman. A glass of water? Bring a bucket and throw it over her! She deserves it! Rachel, I think a rest in the other room do you good. I'll call the boots. -Boots! -Sir? Boots, get me an officer. A moment, boots. We're in an awkward position. A distressing case, but we have no power to control the lady's actions. I fear we must look for a compromise. What sort of compromise? A financial one. Ah, yes, I can see. I can't have my sister being made a fool of. Mr. Jingle, could I have a private word with you? A quick one, yes. Now, sir, you and I are men of the world. My two friends are not. We both know very well that you have run off with this lady for the sake of her money. Why, I-- Now, men of the world, sir, don't frown. We understand each other. Very good, very good. Now, the fact is that beyond a few hundred, the lady has little or nothing until the death of her mother, a fine old lady. Old lady? (clears throat) Why yes, she is rather old, but she comes from a family where since the time Julius Caesar invaded Britain, only one member hasn't lived to 85, and he was beheaded by Henry VIII. The lady in question is not yet 73. Well? Well, you are a fine young man, man of the world, able to boost your fortune if only you had some capital, ay? Well? Don't you think, sir, I put it to you, don't you think that 50 pounds and liberty would be better than Ms. Wardle and... expectation? Won't do, not half enough. Well, my dear sir, we won't waste time splitting straws. Say, 70? Won't do. Right then, sir. Come and this instant, I will write you a check for 80 pounds. Man of honor, can't be bought. Well, my dear sir, just tell me what will do. Expense of business, money out of pocket, license, compensation, breach of honor, loss of the lady, one hundred and twenty pounds. Yes, my dear sir, never mind the last two items. Let's say an even 100. One hundred and twenty. Yes, of course, 120. Ahem. Let us rejoin the others. Mr. Wardle, Mr. Jingle will accept 100-- One hundred and twenty. Yes, of course, 120 pounds to forget his great love for your sister. Pay the scoundrel and then throw him out! ♪ Bye-bye, Pickwick, must be off. Here, take license, get the name altered. Take the lady home. Do it for Snodgrass. Why, I'll! ♪ No use running after him, sir. Yes, boots, you're right. But, if I ever meet that terrible man again, why-- Calm yourself, Pickwick. We are rid of him now, and for his sake, let us hope our paths never cross again. I'm much obliged to you, Tupman, old friend. Here, here, sir. Gentlemen, I suggest we spend the night here and return to Dingley Dell in the morning. I think we would all benefit from a good night's sleep before the journey. Sensible idea. Sam, possible to arrange-- Yes, sir, rooms and food, at once! That man should be more than just a boots. Now, if you will both excuse me, I'll see to my foolish sister. Gentlemen, if you will excuse me, I shall retire, as I am much fatigued. Goodnight, Tupman. -Well done. -Goodnight. Pickwick, I've been thinking about your position. You're not getting any younger, you know? (chuckles) Mr. Wardle, I'm a retired business man, money is no problem. What do you mean by my position? Well, you need a manservant. A manservant? What a novel idea! Well, I confess it has never occurred to me. I do believe you are right. Capital! Hmm, the problem is to find the right sort of person. I think I can recommend a good man for the job. I would welcome your suggestion. Pray, whom do you have in mind? Why, Sam, of course! Sam the boots. As a matter of fact, I've taken the liberty of asking him to come and speak to us. What do you think, Pickwick? (knock on door) Ah, here he is now. Come in! Ah, Sam, come in. Mr. Pickwick wants to speak to you about something. Now, Sam, with regard to the matter on which Mr. Wardle, with the concurrence of myself, -sent for you-- -The point, sir? "Out with it," as the father said to the child when he swallowed the shilling. I want to know, in the first place, whether you have reason to be discontented with your present situation? Before I answer that dear question, gentlemen, I should like to know, in the first place, whether you are going to provide me with a better one? Why, I'd half made up my mind to engage you myself. -Have you though? -Yes. (unintelligible) with boots? No. I want a manservant to attend upon me and travel with me on my journeys of investigation. Well, well, wages? I think, uh, one pound a month, 12 pounds a year. -Clothes? -Two suits. Then, I'm lent to a single gentleman and the terms is agreed upon. Excellent! Pickwick, you have done yourself a service. I believe I have! Sam, tomorrow, I travel to Dingley Dell. In a week, I return to my lodgings in London. Before your arrival, I must inform my landlady, Mrs. Bardell, a kind and thoughtful widow who, no doubt, will be pleased by this decision. You, I'm sure, will have to serve out your time here. I suggest we meet in London in a week's time. A very fine plan, sir. ♪ My own manservant, ay? Excuse me, Pickwick. I must talk to Rachel again, try to coax her out of her room. Won't even leave her bed. Poor woman. ♪ My own manservant, ay? ♪ ♪ Mrs. Bardell? Yes, sir? Your little boy is taking a great length of time on the errand upon which I sent him. Well, it's a good long way from here. Ah, very true. So it is. (clears throat) -Mrs. Bardell? -Yes, sir? Do you think it is a much greater expense to keep two people, than to keep one. Ah, Mr. Pickwick! What a question! Well, but, do you? That depends a good deal upon the person, Mr. Pickwick. And whether it's a careful and savant person. That's very true, but the person I had in my eye, I think, possesses all these qualities and has, moreover, a considerable knowledge of the world, and a great deal of sharpness. This, Mrs. Bardell, may be of material use to me. Now, Mr. Pickwick! Indeed. To tell you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made up my mind. Dear me, sir! You'll think it very strange now that I never consulted you about this matter till I sent your little boy out this morning. To get him out of the way? How thoughtful, how considerate! Well, what do you think? Oh, Mr. Pickwick, you are very kind, sir. It will save you a great deal of trouble, won't it? Oh, I never thought anything of the trouble, sir. And of course, I should take more trouble to please you then than ever. But, it's so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much consideration for my loneliness. Ah, to be sure, I never thought of that. When I am in town, you will always have somebody to sit with you. To be sure, so you will. I'm sure I ought to be a very happy woman! And your little boy. Bless his little heart. He too will have a companion, a lively one. Oh, you dear! Oh, you good, kind, little dear! I'll never leave you, dear, kind, good soul! (Pickwick struggling) Oh, mercy upon me! I hear somebody coming up the stairs. That's a good woman. I think I'm going to faint! This is too much! Ah! It's hot in here, Mr. Pickwick, as the man said when he fell into the fire. What have you done to my mother? ♪ Ow! Sam, take this little villain away. Oh, let me go, let me go! -Oh, let me go! -You stay here, my boy. She'll be all right. What's the problem, sir? Let me go! Let me go! Sam, you'd better help me lead this woman downstairs. Oh, I'm better now. My boy will help me down the stairs. I cannot conceive what is the matter with that woman. One would think I had proposed marriage instead of merely announcing the acquisition of a manservant. Ah, Sam, I shall never understand women. Anyway, you've arrived.

Give them at once, back in a moment. Scoundrel? I don't understand. Mr. Fitzmarshall is a brilliant financier. Mr. Hunter and I were receiving his advice on a small business venture. His name, ma'am, is Alfred Jingle and he is a fraud, an imposter, the cause of much mischief. But, I doubt you'll see him again, now that he's been exposed. I think we should give chase! Give chase?

What do you say to a hot punch before dinner? Why not? I'd also like a word with the innkeeper. (phone ringing) -Innkeeper? -Yes, sir? A word, if you please. Certainly, sir. I wonder if you know of any places about here with historical interest, or surrounded by legend. We are engaged in antiquarian research. Well, gentlemen, Tom Smart's the name. I have a story you'll both find interesting. It took place right here in this inn. Why, then, Mr. Smart, won't you join us for a hot punch and tell us your story? Very civilly, you gents. Lucy! Three hot punches. My story tells of the time I had the honor of beating the devil at his own game. The devil, Mr. Smart? The very same. Years ago, I were a traveler selling pots and pans. (lighting crashes) One dreadful night, I stayed here. Raining cats and dogs, it was. I ordered hot punch, which was served to me by the landlady herself, and I knew at once, she was the girl for me. My only rival was a tall sinister gentleman with black, wavy hair and whiskers. It was obvious he had some hold over her. His evil appearance put me in mind of the devil himself. I fancied that I could even smell the sulfur of the netherworld. I decided to get some sleep, try to forget my dream of becoming the landlady's husband. I went up to bed. (lightning crashing) But try as I might, I couldn't sleep. The couple downstairs had gotten the better of me. It was then I noticed the strange, high-back chair, an odd piece, indeed.

I am her guardian, Tom. You? I knew her mother and her grandmother. She was very fond of me. I've been a great favorite among the women in my time, but that's not the point. I want you to marry the landlady. Me, sir? You. No, no. There's somebody else in the wind, a tall man with black whiskers. Oh, yes, I know all about that. They're due to be married tomorrow. What? Now listen, Tom. I'm almost certain you are the man to save her... And me. Save you? The moment her marries her, he will sell the inn and all the furnishings and disappear. She will be deserted and left to ruin. But I will catch my death of cold in some broker's shop. What can I do? You can prove that you are worthy of taking that rascal's place.

Yes, yes, of course, but I'm rather out of practice, and also, I have no skates. Oh, I have skates for all! ♪ (laughter) ♪ Now there, sir, off with you and show them how it's done. Stop, Sam, stop.

Perhaps we should take your mind away from today's nasty experience. A Christmas story, perhaps? Nothing to do with sliding, I hope. Haha, oh, no, of course not. But I think you may find the story of Gabriel Grub and the goblins diverting. Goblins, ay? Delighted to hear it. Well, it must be 50 or so years ago, now.

What man wanders among graves and churchyards on such a night as this? Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub! Where did those voices come from? What have you got in that bottle? G--Gin, sir. Who drinks gin alone in a churchyard on a night such as this? Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub! And who then, is our fair and lawful prize? Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub! Well, Gabriel, what do you say? Uh, I think I'll go back and finish my work. Work? What work? The grave, sir, making the grave. Oh, the grave. Who makes a grave and takes pleasure in it when all other men are merry? Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub! I'm afraid my friends want you, Gabriel. I don't think they can, sir. They don't even know me, sir. I don't think the gentlemen have ever seen me before, sir. Oh, yes, they have. We know the man with the sulky face and the grim scowl, that came down the street tonight and struck that little boy because the boy could be merry and he could not. An unfortunate accident, sir.

Ah, there's more in heaven and earth, Wardle, as the poet says. (knocking on door) Why-- Yes, come in! A, uh, gentleman to see Mr. Pickwick. Bailiff, he said he was. Bailiff... To see me? Whatever for? Show him, in Sam, if you please. Yes, sir. This is the, uh, gentleman, sir. You are Samuel Pickwick? I am. Then, sir, it is my duty to serve notice for you to appear in Her Majesty's Court of Petty Sessions on this day, three months hence, to face the charge of a breach of promise. ♪ Breach of promise? Are you sure you have the right man? One must have to promise something before one can be charged for breaching that promise. The lady who is, uh, charging breach of promise is, um, uh, a widowed landlady from London, the name of Bardell. Mrs. Bardell? Goodness gracious. And mind you attend, sir. Mark my words, it will be much the worst for you if you don't. (laughter) Your Honor, never in the-- Order! Order! Another outburst like that and I shall clear the court! Please continue. Your Honor, never in the whole course of my professional experience, never from the very first moment I applied myself to the study and practice of the law, have I approached a case with feelings of such deep emotion, or with such a heavy sense of responsibility imposed upon me. A sense of responsibility that I could never have supported were I not buoyed up and sustained by a conviction so strong that it amounts to positive certainty that the cause of truth and justice, or in other words, the cause of my much injured and most oppressed client, Mrs. Bardell, must prevail with I-- Your Honor, really! I think that-- Mr. Pickwick, please sit down! Any objections you may have are overruled! Please continue, sir. Thank you, Your Honor. Damages, gentlemen of the jury, heavy damages are the only punishment which you can visit upon this--this being who stands erect on two legs and bares all the outward semblance of a man, but who is, in fact, a monster! Your Honor, I rest my case! Gentlemen of the jury, in reviewing this case several things have become obvious. If Mrs. Bardell is right, it is then perfectly clear that Mr. Pickwick is wrong. You will now retire to consider the evidence. The court will be seated. (gavel bangs) Gentlemen of the jury, have you reached a verdict? Yes we have, Your Worship. What is your verdict? Guilty, Your Worship. With what damages? Seven-hundred and fifty pounds, Your Worship. Mr. Pickwick, the charge against you has been proved, and you are ordered to pay Mrs. Bardell the sum of 750 pounds. I shall not, Your Honor! Indeed, I shall pay no damages whatever! Surely you will pay? You must pay, Mr. Pickwick. Prison is the only alternative. Order! Order! Mr. Pickwick, you leave me no choice. You have refused to pay the lawful damages and I am therefore bound to commit you to the debtor's prison until such time as you come to your senses! (exasperated sigh) Mr. Pickwick, it is well within your means to make lawful amends and I strongly suggest you do so. Debtor's prison is not for one such as you, as you no doubt appreciate. I will not pay one fine! Then, to prison you go, Mr. Pickwick! ♪ Well, Sam. Well, sir. Pretty comfortable now, ay? Pretty well, sir. Very well, Sam. Listen to what I'm about to say. Certainly, sir. Fire away. I have felt from the first, Sam, that this is not the place to which to bring a young man. Nor an old one neither. Right, Sam, but old men come here through their own heedlessness and innocence, and young men may be brought here by the selfishness of those they serve. It is better for those young men, in every point-of-view, that they should not remain here. Do you understand me, Sam? Why, no, Mr. Pickwick. I do not understand, sir. Try, Sam, try. Well, sir, I think I see your drift. And if I do see your drift, it is my opinion that, "You're coming at it a great deal too strong," as the coachman said to the snowstorm when it overtook him. Independently of my wish that you should not be idling about in a place like this for years to come, I feel that for a debtor in the Fleet Prison to be attended by his manservant is a monstrous absurdity. Now, I'll tell you what it is, sir. This here sort of thing won't do at all, so don't let's hear no more about it. I am serious and resolved, Sam. You are, sir, ay? Very good, sir, then so am I. Sam! Sam, come here at once! So, Mr. Weller, you can see my problem, and what I want to know. Have you an answer for me? Stuck there himself, poor critter, without nobody to take his pot? It can't be done, Samuel. It can't be done. Of course it can't! I knew that before I came! He goes in rather raw, and he'll come out so exceeded brown, his most familiar friends won't know him. It oughtn't to be, Samuel! It mustn't be! Ah, but it is. Well, now you been prophesying away about what will happen to the governor if he's left alone. Don't you see any way of taking care of Mr. Pickwick? No, I don't, Sammy. Nothing at all? No way. Unless-- Yes? I'll tell you what, maybe you'll trouble me for the loan of five and 20 pounds. What good will that do? Perhaps, I may ask for it back five minutes afterwards. Perhaps, you may not pay. You wouldn't think of arresting your own flesh and blood and sending him off to the Fleet Prison, would you? You unnatural vagabond! I know someone who works at the Old Bailey, Sammy. Justice can be done, after another hot punch. (laughing) Sam, my good lad, I'm glad you've returned. I had no intention of hurting your feelings this afternoon, my faithful fellow. Put down your hat, Sam, and let me explain my meaning a little more at length. The fact is, Mr. Pickwick, um, the fact is that is now my bed. What? Yes, my bed, sir. I'm a prisoner. I was arrested this very afternoon for debt. You, arrested for debt? Yes, sir, terrible thing. But, Sam, I, um-- No, sir, it's my debt. I'll fix it up, and when I do, I can leave this terrible place. Aw, Sam, you are an honorable and proud man. (whistling) Hello. That old gentleman has a fine coat. We might borrow it a while. You tell him not to worry about it. It will be in good hands. Not bad shoes either. (laughing) Well, gentlemen, I don't think them clothes is for either of you. Don't suit you. You see, they are clean, and you gentlemen look very dirty to me. My boy, welcome to the Fleet Prison. Yeah! ♪ Ow! ♪ (men struggling) Stop, you ruffians! Leave that man alone! ♪ Welcome to Fleet Prison. Thanks friend. Without your help-- Well, well, if it isn't Mr. Jingle! Hello, Pickwick, birds of a feather, ay? Well, I--I-- I never thought I'd be thanking you. I would have been very sore and sad if you hadn't come along and helped me remove them gentlemen. No trouble, fought 50 once, all armed. Was all alone. Well, another time. Mr. Jingle? Weird place this, strange thing. Serves me right. Mr. Jingle, I should like to speak to you in private. Let us step outside. Certainly, can't step far. No danger of over-walking yourself. Grounds charming, romantic, but not extensive. ♪ You've forgotten your coat, Jingle. Oh, couldn't help it. Must eat, wants of nature, and all that. What do you mean? Gone winter, sir, last coat, no choice. Lived on a pair of boots for a fortnight. Silk umbrella, ivory handle, one week. You mean to say that you lived for three weeks upon a pair of boots and a silk umbrella with an ivory handle? True, pawnbroker shop. Oh. Yes, I understand you now. I thought for a moment, ahem, never mind. Hard, dashed hard, fever, weak, ill, hungry, no hope. Come, come, my poor fellow. We shall see what can be done. This requires some thinking. (gate opens) Pickwick! Yes, over here. Gentleman to see you, name of Tupman. Hello, Tupman. What do you have there? Good day, Mr. Pickwick. I have here the papers in Bardell versus Pickwick. I would rather the subject never be mentioned between us. Well, Mr. Pickwick, I have some news. What sort of news, Tupman? Mrs. Bardell is a prisoner within these walls. Mrs. Bardell? For what reason? Her lawyers Dobson and Farm, tricked her, legally of course, into signing a paper saying she was ultimately responsible for their costs. When you declined to pay, they claimed the money from her. She didn't have it, so she's a prisoner. Serves the dreadful woman right! My dear sir, the first question I have to ask is whether this woman is to remain here. How can you ask me? It rests with her lawyers. You know that very well. Come, come, Mr. Pickwick. I know nothing of the kind. These men put her here, it is quite obvious, to impose pressure upon you to pay the money, which they know you can well afford. As I see it, this matter rests solely, wholly, and entirely with you. With me? With you. The cost in this matter are 150 pounds. Nothing to you. By paying the cost, you can obtain a full release for both you and Mrs. Bardell, and discharge from the damages. And further, a voluntary statement under her hand that this whole wretched business was, from the first, fermented, encouraged, and brought about by Dobson and Farm, and she deeply regrets ever having been the instrument of annoyance or injury to you. Well Tupman, now I know your news. Is that all you have to say to me? My dear Mr. Pickwick, I urge you to pay the costs. Good day, Mr. Tupman. ♪ Mr. Winkle to see you, sir. Hello, Winkle. Good to see you. Good day, Mr. Pickwick. Tupman is also here, but something's distracted him. Sir, would you go into the passageway and see what's happened to him? Very well, Mr. Winkle. I have here a petition signed by all the members of the Pickwick Club which, without its founder, can no longer exist. We implore you to end your obstinacy and pay your debt. Return to society to continue your invaluable work. I have been in this place only a short time, Winkle, but already I have made some invaluable observations about prison conditions. And what would they be? Though unfortunate, I feel this has been a highly educational experience and would warrant a good deal of space in the book we intended publishing. Reform, sir, that's what is required. Our prison system is a disgrace to all right thinking people. And you think you can do something about this? Yes, indeed, but not from this prison. Sir, sir! You won't believe this, but I just saw the notorious Mr. Jingle! Is he also a prisoner? He is, sir, but a new Jingle. Very reformed! Mr. Pickwick has been helping him buy extra food and some extra clothes, and has arranged a position for him in the West Indies. When the job is ready, Mr. Pickwick will pay off Mr. Jingle's debts and he'll be off to warmer climes. Extraordinary! Is there a man alive like Mr. Pickwick? Very unlikely, sir. Ah, now you are all here. I have made a decision. I will pay the costs. Ah! Very good, Mr. Pickwick, very good. Thank you, Sam. I've realized my work is too important for me to stay here any longer. Personal feelings must not stand in the way. The shepherd must rejoin his flock. Such a relief, sir. Oh, such a relief! ♪ Farewell, oh den of inequity, oh, house of debauchery and misery.
