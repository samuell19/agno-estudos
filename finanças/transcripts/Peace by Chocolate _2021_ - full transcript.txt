- Issam... - You must be Tareq. The name's Zariah. This is Heather. Oh! Oh... - Welcome to Halifax. - Is it that cold? - It's Canada, hon. But you should be set. - This is my husband, Frank. Um... And we'll be right back, OK? Come on. - : Uh... How is your English? - My English is very good. - Oh! Great. - Are we far from where we're going? - No, no, it's a quick two, maybe three-hour drive. - Hmm. - You were in, uh... in Lebanon. Is that right? - Yes. We were in a refugee camp. I was volunteered as a paramedic. It wasn't, uh... sustainable? - Here we go. - Frank, what are you doing? - Well, gotta give him the grand tour, show him what he's up against. Welcome to Antigonish, your new home. - Where's the town? - This is the town, bud. - Well, don't look too hard, now. - Your real house will be ready when the rest of you get here. Hang on to him, honey. - Yeah, yeah, I got him. - This is a wonderful night. We get to show the world how to open our hearts and welcome in people who are fleeing extraordinarily difficult situations. - Tareq, my visa still hasn't arrived, and Mama's saying she won't go without me. - I'll call Pierre in the morning. - How's she going by, eh? - Habibi! Ah, it's good to see you! Did you make it to Canada OK? - A few bumps. I know you are busy. Alaa's visa hasn't arrived. - Hold on, habibi, let me check. Looks like her visa was flagged. - What? Their flight's in two days! - Ah, probably a mistake. I'll petition. Don't worry. Errors like this happen a lot. - One more thing. Please, Pierre, I want you to move our sponsorship to Toronto. - What? If you leave, you'll forfeit your sponsorship. - Damascus is 5 million. This place is 5,000. They don't know what to do with themselves. - Hey, brother, you're a smart guy. It's this or a camp in Lebanon. It's your call. Talk to you soon. - Tareq! There you are. Oh! You can take your jacket off, you know. Well, maybe your hat. Oh, you're in some luck. It's a week to deadline. You need an MCAT, a letter of recommendation and your degree. - My transcript. - It's a mess. - I was so close to finishing medical school in Damascus. This is my second chance. - I'm not sure you'll be eligible with this. - I went to classes when Damascus was being bombed. I think I can find my way around some rules on a website. - It's not that simple. - If I have to do some dishonourable work so I might do an honourable work, what's the harm? - How about this: Let me introduce you to our local surgeon. He's a Dalhousie grad, kind of reminds me of you. - That's perfect, yeah. One more thing. - Yes. - What's this saying: "How's she going by, eh?" - How's she going by, eh? I'll go slower. How's... she... going... by... eh? Eh... That's tougher to explain. - Alaa, make sure they come. We only have one chance to make this happen. - Hey, hey, hey! Hey, don't just stand there, guys. Come on in! - Right, so your sponsorship provides $2,000 per month for a year. And we'll do whatever we can to help, but in 12 months' time, you're gonna be on your own. Here, Tareq, could you... could you sign there, please? Thanks. - Don't worry about the house. You're good here for a while. - Look at this. Yeah. We're born in the same year. You and me... 53. 53, exactly. - Thank you. Welcome home. - Thank you. Thanks. - Oh, uh, one more thing. All right, so what you're gonna want to do is you want to bend at the knees. At the knees. Not at the back. OK? At the knees. Good. So you scoop. All right? Grab it... Esposito over to Henderson... scores! All right? All right, that's it. Yep. Grab a good chunk of it, good, and throw it over there. Nice shot, bud. It's OK. Good shot. It's just snow. - Are you Arab? - Nadim? - There's two of us now. Come with me. - Medicine I eat? - Yeah, my parents are Lebanese, but, you know, you don't inherit language. You said you study medicine? - Yes. Family medicine. You are a surgeon? - Oh yeah, the best. And the only one in Antigonish. Let me grab my coat. - I have the qualifications, not the paperwork. This game is hockey, huh? - Hockey's a lot less fun. You know what I tell people about Canada? Paramedics drive the ambulances, and doctors drive cabs. Listen, if you need advice or something, don't be shy. Just, uh, let me know. Hmm? - Aren't you Muslim? - If you ask my parents. - Look, I need a letter of recommendation. - This is why you're here? Arabs, you guys don't know how to socialize? - No, no, I'm sorry... - It's all about the hustling, business? What happened to friendship? - I'm sorry, I didn't mean... - Dude, I'm kidding. Of course I'll do it. Oh, man... - Tareq! Tareq! - Good morning. - Sample? Hmm. - OK. - Um... - Excuse me? - Hmm... - Yes, that's a chocolate wheel. Sorry, sir, no, no! You cannot come back here. - Excuse me, sir, you need to leave. Ah! No, no, no. - You need to leave. - Baba? - No, no, no, no, no. - What is going on? - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - There are no openings available that don't require at least basic English. Excuse me. Sorry, gentlemen. Is there anything else that I can help you with? - No, thank you. I'll continue studying medicine at Dalhousie University. - Wow! That's a great school. - Thank you. - Pierre? - It's late. Is everything OK? - Alaa's visa was denied. - What? Hold on a sec. Looks like we can't locate her husband. - What are our options? - For now, nothing. I'm sorry. You need Fadi's consent, or Alaa's visa won't get approved. - I understand. Just let me know if you think of anything. - I will. Talk to you soon, my friend. - That's $22.60. - Mmm! Mmm! - These chocolates are amazing. - Oh my God! They're so good. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. He did all that from in here? - He was the best chocolatier in Syria. Until the factory, you know... - Yeah. Tell Papa I have an idea. - Thank you. Thanks. - Look at you fellows! Oh! - I hope you like Syrian chocolate. - Oh, chocolate! Oh! Hey, gals! This is the fellow that I was talking about. - See these people? They make the best chocolate, all right? Mark my words. - I hope you mean... - I'm still waiting. I'll let you know the minute I know. - Half dozen here. A half dozen. Uh, six? - I got you. - Enjoy it. Tareq! - I recommend every single one of these. On my life. - A suicide attack in Hermel in Lebanon has killed 4 people. Now, this is the fourth time... The cause of the explosion, a suicide bomber... - High five! I got this, Tareq. - Thank you. - Interesting place for the town's second chocolatier. I don't think we were ever introduced officially. The name's Kelly. - How's she going by, eh? - You and your father came by my chocolate emporium the other day. The one on Main Street. - Yeah, I remember, yeah. What can we help you with? - Well, I know that you're new to town. And I would be willing to showcase some of your exotic chocolates in my shop. Of course, if you had the right experience. - He's the expert. I just help. I'm actually, uh, studying to be a doctor. - Well, we're getting busy for the holidays. There's no better way to introduce the customer to your product. Just talk to him about it and let me know. Here's my card. There you go. - He no eat! Never! - What's going on? - He doesn't want to work with Kelly. - Yeah, well, the thing is, you guys don't know what you have here. - She has equipment and money. We have no equipment and no money. - Frank? - Oh! I'm not gonna be able to fit into my pants! - No, no, eat, eat. - Thank you, Shahnaz. Oh, that's good. - Delicious. Mmm! - Look at this. - Is this all you have left? You're gonna run out of money. - He only works with premium ingredients. - It's gonna be hard to make ends meet with this. - We have 11 months. You are an accountant. What would you do? Just a sec. I'll be back. - Here. Come here, come here. - Thank you, Frank. Thank you very much. - OK. Look at this. Sea salt chocolate. - No, no, no! - No, it's really good! It's very popular here. - Bad! Here. Better. - Come on, Barry, is this really the best you can do? - Without an established history, I... Look, I love what you're trying to do, huh? But this is all we can offer. My hands are tied, Frank. - Yeah, good! - I don't know, Frank. He seems to like it. - Do you even know what this is? - No, no, no! I can't ask him to sign this! - Why, Frank? We will pay it off! - 12% interest, Tareq! It's gonna kill you guys! - I think we'll be fine. We'll be fine. - Issam, interest? Very high. - Interest? - Yes. - No. No! No. No. - We cannot take loan with interest. It's against our faith. - Huh? - What? - There's no interest on loans in Islamic banks. - No interest? - I didn't even know that was a thing. I don't suppose you offer interest-free loans here? - This isn't a charity, Frank. Hey, Dan, you wanna hear something great? - All right, come on. Let's go. - Come on! No interest? Do you know how crazy that sounds, Frank? - It was a lousy deal anyway, bud. Thanks, Barry. - A little to your left. Little more to your left. - In a way, I'm making people's life worse. You know how bad sugar is. - Do you know how many surgeons love sugar? - Back home, they all smoke. - Here. Merry Christmas. It'll help you with your aim. - Thank you. - Apply to more schools. - My father told me not to. - So? Look, I left my family to move here. Of course they didn't like it, but I did. - It doesn't feel right. - Your choice, bro. - People really do this in Canada? - Nope. Literally just me. And you know what? You need to be hustling right now, networking. I'll do you another solid. I want you to come speak at a conference I'm chairing in the new year. - What would I speak about? - The war, the struggle, your story, man. - No, I'm not much of a public speaker. I'll pass. No. - You have to hustle. Hustle. Hmm. - Oh, yummy! Mm-hmm? - Hmm? That's why I asked for the meeting. - He wants your money. - Issam might be a stranger to you, but he's my friend. His business is going faster than we could've anticipated. - Well, I hear they're running Kelly out of business. - She's just sook about not being the flavour of the week. - Well, she says it's the Syrians. - Her shop's slower than molasses. - At least she's got space. If Issam's production grows, he won't even have place for the product. - So you want us to build him a factory or something? - $2,000, from you, me and Heather. - I'm in. 'Tis the giving season, after all. - Great. - Frank, you know I'm always happy to help, but you're asking Pete and I for $4,000... - No, no. I'm asking for $12,000. I have two more meetings this morning. Here's Dan. He's my next one. - We can't just give loans to every come from away! There's, what, 50,000? - These people left their lives behind, their families! I can't even imagine! If we can't help our friends, then, well, fuck! It's better than church. - You know he'd do the same for yous. - Frank! - Hey. - What a surprise! - Yeah. Hey, the place looks great. - Thanks. - I'll, uh, have a coffee. - One cup of Ethiopian dark roast coming right up. - How's business? - Well, you're my 5th customer this week. - Sorry to hear that. But, you know, it's only Tuesday. - Everyone's getting their fill off your friends at church, hey? - Oh, come on. You don't only sell chocolate. You sell coffee and, uh... high-quality vegan baking goods. - Why are you here, Frank? - Well, word around town is that you're blaming my friends for your lack of business. I wouldn't be a good neighbour if I didn't come over here and collect your thoughts. - How long we known each other? - Since you were a kid. - Long time. I've worked real hard for this business, Frank. - The way I see it, there's room enough in town for both of you. - Look outside! It's two days before Christmas. Does Main Street look busy to you? Rent's going up. Tourists are going down. And the way I see it, one of my 5 customers is trying to tell me how to run my business. I offered your friends a part. They didn't want it. In fact, they didn't even call. - I'm just saying, more refugees, more people in town, maybe more customers for you. What do I owe you? - It's on the house. - Sorry to take your time. - Frank! Shouldn't it be neighbours before newcomers? - Hey, hey, hey! Huh? What do you think? - What is it? - For you. For the chocolate. A factory. - A what? - I know she's small, but at least Shahnaz gets her kitchen back. - Yes! Yes, yes, exactly! And... we all pitched in and got a community loan. I don't think he'll allow it. - Look, look, look. It's not a handout. It's a loan, OK? No interest. - Interest, no! - No! No interest, no, no. It's like a... like a belated Christmas gift. Right? I'll take my interest in kibbeh. - Issam! Tareq! Come! - He's a bright entrepreneur, a doctor to be... and my friend. Tareq Hadhad. - Thank you for having me. I almost didn't come today. I'm not used to speaking to crowds. It makes me nervous. That's not why I almost didn't come. A week ago... we found out my brother-in-law was killed in Syria. My family has endured many hardships. But we are one of the lucky ones. That's why I came today. If you looked at the comments online, you would think refugees were like rats. The truth is simple. We have families like everyone else. We love like everyone else. We seek peace like everyone else. But we don't die like everyone else. We lost my sister's husband to the war. If that makes us lucky, what is it like for the unlucky ones? Becoming a refugee means you lose everything. Your home... your history... your family. I'm here to say to you: thank you for your kindness. But there's many of us suffering. - : The parents, the older people here, tell me they've not been able to find work. - heard that Canada is taking some refugees. - Just over those mountains there, that's Syria, not very far. - Hmm? - so that they can go home. - Hmm! Who came up with that? - Neil, a friend of Frank's who does marketing. - Imagine! You got a marketing guy! - Uh-huh. - You could've asked me. - How's she going by, Tareq? - Hey, how 'bout you, eh? - Got a bunch of mail for you, bud. Your sign's got a typo. It's P-I-E-C-E. - Hey, Papa! - Hi, Papa! - Whoa! Look at this place! Hey, fancy! That's better than a ladle, huh? Wow! Mmm. Oh! Mmm! Ah! - Salt. - Mmm! Wow. - Uh, Frank... - Mmm? "All I have, gone. "No job... "no home, no help. "But now... you help." You good. Thank you. - Yeah. - Thank you. Thank you all for your incredible support. This factory will not just bring chocolate to the people of Antigonish. It will also inspire more refugees to keep the faith and contribute to their new home. Making chocolate is my father's dream. He started because he knew that chocolate could make people happy, and if chocolate made people happy, then he was the maker of happiness. My father adds he wish you all to eat with health. - And he was doing this from his kitchen before, like a ladle and a pot, and he would use a knife to scrape it off in ice cubes, ice cube trays. It was unbelievable. This is like a dream, trust us. Oh, oh! Excuse me for a second. Thank you, Shahnaz. Oh! Oh, that's so good! - We're live in Antigonish, Nova Scotia, and I'm joined now by Syrian refugee Tareq Hadhad. - Hello, Canada! Thank you for having us. - Now that you're a local celebrity, how does all the attention feel? - We are honoured. It left us speechless. - All right, let's see how the magic happens. - Can I say something to the people of Canada first? I know there's a shortage of doctors in Canada. Refugees who come to this country can help. Medical school won't accept my credits. So if anybody watching this can assist, this is how I can help, the way Canada helped us. - All right, now back to the chocolate. - I never did you wrong, Frank. - Hey, Kelly. - You know, I didn't have one problem until they showed up. - Ah, come on, you know that's not true. And they've had a hard life. - And people here haven't? - I'm not saying they haven't! I'm just helping out my friends. - Yeah. I guess we're not friends. You have a permit for that thing, right? - Mr. Hadhad, can I have a moment? - Yes, of course. - Jim MacDonald. I'm a regional executive at Sobeys grocery. We're a family business as well, one of the biggest in Canada, and I wanted to congratulate your family. - Thank you. - You're the talk of the province, you know? Your story is the new Canadian dream. There's a lot of opportunity for you folks beyond Antigonish, maybe even beyond Nova Scotia. Here. Let's talk about the future. - I didn't have superheroes growing up in Syria. I had doctors. They saved lives, command respect, success. They don't make sweets. - Look, it's a good start. People liked your speech. - It seems they did. Someone from Sobeys approached me. - To buy you guys out? - They want to make an investment. - Ah, but your dad will never go for that, though. - He needs me too much already. - Look, more money means more employees, which means more time for you. I'm booking you to speak at a class at Dalhousie. Maybe someone will notice you. But, you know, only if you want. - Our small business, our loving community, means we can build a new home. We can empower other people's dreams and our own. For me, that dream is to be a doctor. Someday, I will be. - Tareq? Hello. I'm Laura. I work in graduate studies here. Wonderful speech. I'd like to offer you an opportunity to join us. - Yes, of course. - We always ask the best speakers to join us to speak at convocation. Thank you so much. We'll be in touch with you tomorrow, OK? - Thank you. - Thank you. - And this is where the signature goes. You follow me? Good. You have to date it properly, 'cause... How'd it go? - Can I have a moment with my dad? - Sure. Bye-bye, Papa. - Bye-bye, Papa. - Hey, Frank. How's it going? - Hey, Liam. What are you... what are you doing here? - So, why do you want to work here? - Um... I love chocolate. I saw you on the news. I got excited when you were hiring, so... - Do you work hard? - Sure do, man. - And you show up on time? - Yes. - You're hired. - That's it? - Yeah. You start tomorrow morning, 8:30. - Sweet, man! I like you! See you, Frank. - Yeah, see you, Liam. Really? - What? - Liam! Hang on, I'll introduce you to Issam. - Oh, cool! - And this is where the magic happens. Hello, Papa! - Hello, Papa. - Uh, this is Liam, your new employee. - I'm really excited to work here. - Chocolate. For you. - Oh, thank you so much! You shouldn't have! - $10. - Uh, no, no, no. Uh... Uh, Liam help. - Help buy. - No, no. Help. - Help buy. - Oh God... - $10. - OK, all right. $10. - He thought Liam was a customer. - He had 50 people working for him in Syria. He'll be fine. - Why don't you tell him? You're the one he wants to work with, nobody else. - It's too late now. Besides, he trusts me. - Exactly. But Liam's the one who's gonna be working with him all day. - I'm very busy, Frank. I don't want to make chocolate much longer. - Yeah, no shit! You came right out and said that on national television. You and your dad have a good thing going here, bud. Can't you see that? - When you gave us your loan, Frank, I thought it would be an opportunity for us to hire even more Liams! To give me the freedom I needed! It didn't! We're gonna wake up my mom. Listen, we really appreciate your help, but this is not your business. - Wow. Damascus or Delaware, kids are all the same. And you're acting like one. - Tareq! - Tareq! - Tareq! A friend of Nadim's is a friend of mine. - Liam! Come. - Hey, boss. Yeah... boom. Everything good? - Yes. - Everything OK? - Yes. - Everything fine? - What? - Did you see this notice? It was taped on the front door. It means, uh, the factory is no good. - Factory no good? - Factory no good. - Factory no good?! - Yeah, it's no good. I don't... I'm sorry, I don't... - Liam! Stop! Stop! Stop! - OK. I stopped. - Call Tareq. - Call Tareq. - Call Tareq. - Call Tareq on my phone. OK. - Our total research funding last year was over $100 million. - Wow! That must have helped a lot of people. - Yet never enough. That's why we need people like you. - Yes, Liam? - We got a building issue from the town, and I can't explain it to the old man. He's kind of freaking out, you know? - Can't Frank do it? - I can't reach him, dude. - I'll deal with it. - We just really need you to come back here so we... Bye, boss. - Bye, boss. - Boom! - Baba! - Building permits now? You just couldn't leave them alone, could you? - I had to play by the rules. Where's my loan, Frank? - Don't you wish you had help when you first started out? - People never did help. - I would've helped you. You never asked. I would've helped. You know what, Kelly? Neighbours, newcomers, they're all the same to me. - Tareq! Tareq! Come on! Come on! - Tareq! - Still working. - by giving back what they could. Last month, just months after arriving in Canada, the family realized their dream and opened a small chocolate factory in their new hometown. It's called Peace by Chocolate. - Peace by Chocolate. - Thank you so much. - Tareq. You're everywhere these days, huh? - Thank you. - We still want to work with you. - Welcome. - I hope you don't mind, but I got my guys to cook something up. - Habibi! Come here, come here. - Take a look at your new factory. - Bye-bye. - Your family must have dreamt of this when you came here, right? - Rahim has been asking about you. - Come on, Tareq. I got the means, you got the goods. Let's make this happen. - They're not gonna hold the spot much longer. - Let's move this, and let's move it fast. OK? - Thank you. - Wow! - Now all I need to know is when can I meet Issam? - Friday? - Wonderful. It's a date! I'll see you then. - No touch! - I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry. I need a sample. Please step back. - Out. Out! - I'm not getting out. - How can I help you, sir? - Finally, someone I can understand. We received a tip about food quality control. Do you have a food establishment permit? - Uh... just a second. - I don't understand what... - I believe everything is here. - You don't want me to look through all of this? - English, uh... no good. No good. - I'm sorry. We need to talk. - Jim wants to break ground on a new factory as soon as possible. - Great. - But he wants to meet my dad on Friday first. Can you be there? - Sure. I'd love to meet him. - Thank you. - I'm glad Issam's finally come around on the offer. What the hell, Tareq? - I'll be speaking at the Governor Mansion in Vermont. I cannot be there. - And you're springing this little surprise on me now? You all right? - No. I'm afraid, Frank. - Sorry, bud. I'm not gonna do this for you. If you're not gonna do it for yourself, I'm not doing it for you. Talk to Issam and grow a damn spine. - Ah! - Kelly? - What are you doing here? - Have you tried our new maple flavoured chocolate? - No. - Consider this as a gift. My family's factory in Damascus, did you know it was bombed? Did you know my brother-in-law was killed? That countless friends were taken 15 floors underground and killed? All this so we can come here and do the exact same thing we did there. - I'm so sorry. - My father's factory wasn't bombed because of a food permitting issue. - Right. - Just take them. - Tareq. Just so you know, it wasn't me who called the food inspector or the city. There are other people who feel a certain way about this. - Ah, hey! Oh! Watch out... - Where's that thing? Tray. - Oh! Hey... All right. Do you need some help there? - Go back to work. - OK. - I'm going to Vermont. Yes, Frank? - Is everything OK with Issam? - I just told him about the meeting. - Today? What is wrong with you, bud? - I already have a father, Frank. I don't need another. - Tareq... - I have to go. - Wait, don't... - Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry! - Bad mistake. - I'll take care of this. - Oh! - Oh my God. Are you OK? Are you OK, boss? - Out. Out. - What do you mean? We have so many orders. - Out! OUT! - Passports, please. Sir, you need a valid passport to enter the United States of America. - This is a letter from the Governor of Vermont, an official invitation. I have a speech to do tonight. - You're from Syria, sir? - My family and I, we have a chocolate factory in Nova Scotia. I have some in my trunk. If you want, I can show you. - No, sir, you will stay in your vehicle. You will place your hands on the wheel. - I can't... - Place your hands on the wheel! Now, we're gonna need to ask you some questions. You're gonna pull up slowly and go and park on the left. - Hello, Issam? Jim. Wow! This is... this is impressive. This is all you? Oh, you don't speak English, do you? - English, no. - No. Um... Can I, uh... What is... - Order no complete. Me, tonight, alone. - What, you... All of this tonight? - Ah... - Wow! Um... Hmm. Um... You're an interesting guy, Mr. Hadhad. - Who is this? - My father, Issam. - OK. Where was he born? - Damascus, like me. - Do you have any contacts of Syrian associates on this phone? - Yes. I have friends. - Just answer the question. - Why don't you call the governor? You will see for yourself. - Have it your way. Are there any Canadian citizens that can vouch for you? - Justin Trudeau. - All right. Justin Trudeau. I'll tell you what. I will call him myself, but I'm pretty sure he's a busy man, so you tuck in. - What time is it? - It's about 6:00 a.m. - I missed my speech. - Mm-hmm. And I just worked a double. That sucks, don't it? Believe it or not, we did manage to get ahold of the governor. But, because you attempted to cross the border without a passport, and, uh, let's just say a host of other reasons, your access to the United States is being denied for the next five years. So don't book any more speeches in the US. You have yourself a nice rest of the day, Mr. Hadhad. - Yes, Frank. Sorry, my phone was off. I was detained at the US border. They thought I'm a terrorist. Nora, why do you want to make chocolate? - I'm a huge fan of chocolate. I'm a hard worker. I'd like to work hard and make chocolate. You're hired. - Hey, Tareq. - Hi. Have a seat. - Thanks. - I realized we need to formalize something, Frank. We never put anything into writing, so... we would like to offer you an executive position here. - Wow! Thank you. But, um... I don't think I can accept. - Is everything all right? - Yeah, yeah, no, it's, uh... It's been a hell of a ride. But I've already committed more time than I've got. And this thing has just gotten way bigger than me. I just think it's time I take a step back. - What would we do without you, Frank? - Ah, you got Jim now, you know? He'll take it from here. Um... I better get going. - Frank... Thank you. - You got a great family, Tareq. Take care of them. - : Three, two, one... - Before I let you go... I'd like to say something. We came to Canada to create jobs, not to take jobs. And I'd like to express gratitude to the man making this happen. He believes in a vision of Peace by Chocolate and helping us to make this community even more prosperous. Jim MacDonald of Sobeys grocery! - Tareq. - Boom! - Mr. Issam... - Well, your dad looks happy. - He loves it. - Hmm. - You know what? I think I would make it if we didn't get out of Syria. But my dad... - Still disappointed you said no to my bro. How do you feel? - I feel like... it's never too late. - Hmm. - Hello? - Frank! Come, come! - Hey, Papa! Where is everyone? - Uh... Tareq, away. Ladies, out. Issam rest. - I know the feeling.
