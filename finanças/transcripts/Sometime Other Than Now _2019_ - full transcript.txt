...and you are listening to Northeast Progressive Radio. As my uncle Bobby Nieman always used to say, "If you don't like the weather in New England, don't worry. Just wait 20 minutes. It'll change." Are you open? Oh! I'm... I'm so sorry, I'm sorry. Oh. Can I help you? - I was wondering, is... - We're not open, so... Uh... the motel next door? Do you know if there's anyone around? Oh, uh... really? Sorry. My waitress is late and I'm running way behind. Did you want smoking or non? Is it just you? Okay. Um... so I need just a driver's license and credit card, please. Um... I'm sorry. We need an ID and credit card. Do you... do you know of any other places around here? Just gonna be a couple nights? Towels are right there on the top shelf, and the shower works best if you turn the hot water on first, so. That's the ocean. You can get down to the beach that way, or we're on a point, so you can also go just right down this trail through the shrubs. Oh! The refrigerator, coffeemaker, iron, ironing board. Not gonna use those... but maybe you will. Uh, television remote only works if you turn it on its side. Don't know why that it, but that's how it is. And... what else? Oh! The restaurant opens at 7:00 every day. - You should probably be, uh... - Right. Okay. Whoa. - That's yours. - Thank you. Great. Let's go, let's go! Pickup! Two sunrise breakfasts, okay. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Amber, sweetie, can you get that out to five? Um, I need to find fresh silverware for table... - It's, uh... - Right here. - Thank you, Kate. - Mm-hm. Thank you, Spenser. Hey, Spenser. Your neck okay? - Crap! - What? I just remembered, this guy checked in. - This time of year? - Yeah. - You didn't have a room ready? - Not exactly, but I'm not really in a position to be turning down extra cash right now, so. Here you go, bud. Thanks. Spenser, you didn't have to do that. See you guys later. Adios, Casanova! Bye, Spenser. Hi. I just want to make sure that if you needed anything... housekeeping or, you know, we're still a little early in the season, so I didn't know if I should call someone in, - or... so are you... - No, no, I'm fine. Well, the restaurant closes in a half hour for lunch, if you're hungry. 'Scuse me, um... Where... Never mind. So, I'll see you. So sorry, I really tried. Believe me, I need the money. No, I know, it's okay, it's okay. Um... well, we'll see. Why don't we try again next week, try to pick up some extra shifts? - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. Take care. You too. More coffee? Oh, um... sure. In case you want some reading material. Is she the same one? - Who? - The waitress. - Oh. - Was she the one that didn't show up yesterday? Yeah. And you're the one who has to cover. Well, yeah. Timing belt? Yeah. You work on motorcycles? You mind telling me how you managed to... We're good. Oh! Jesus. Oh! Dammit. Sorry. Uh, I just... it just keeps popping out. I mean, I keep putting it back and it just keeps - coming out again. - It's worn down. Really? It's stripped completely. I-I got it from here, so. Thanks, thank you, though. Sorry... thanks. Shh! Oh, hey, I was just about to call you. You did quite a number. Solenoid's waterlogged. - Can you fix it? - Nah, it's shot. Have to order it, but... Monday at the earliest. Are you the one who replaced the hinge on the office door? I was in town and I saw a hardware store, so I... - I'm sorry, I should have... - Oh, no, it's okay, it's okay. Thank you? You're welcome? Mm-hm? Oh, hi, Kate, how's it going? - Hi, Amber! - Look a little lost. It's so embarrassing. Supposed to, um... supposed to be meeting someone here. - Oh, like a date? - Um, yeah. I have this pal in Boston who's got a brother who's got a friend, so, apparently... thank you... I agreed to meet this guy. - No fooling. - Yeah. - Here's your burger. - Thank you. Hey. Hey! The food's really great here. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Would you like to, uh... - No, no, no, no; God, no, um... Yeah, so enjoy. Uh, I'm gonna go right outside and make a call real quick. You must be Kate. - Hi. - Hi. - Tom, right? - Yeah. - Hey. - It's great to meet you. - You too. - Yeah. Shall we sit down? Yeah. Yes. Hi, what can I get you? Uh, what are the white wines you offer by the glass? Um... sauvignon blanc and chardonnay. No, that's a Napa... I'll have that. So then, I say in closing, "There's three reasons that I took this case. One, I believe in my heart that this woman is innocent; two, I mean, she doesn't have the means to hire another top-flight attorney; and three, because everyone, no matter their circumstances, has the right to a fair trial." Wow, that's amazing. Did she get off? Yeah, fortunately, she did. Let's just hope she was in fact innocent. Excuse me, this... Anyway, I understand you were an attorney in Boston. Yeah, I was for a little while, I did labor, mostly, a little bit of immigration work. Nice! Good for you. Hey, Maureen! Is Amber working tonight? She can't talk right now, Cole, she's working. What the fuck, Amber? - I'm working, Cole. - I've called you, like, ten times. - I can't talk right now. - Bullshit! Tell me what's going on. - Cole, talk tomorrow. - Fuck that! I've called you for three days. You don't even have enough respect to call me back. - I've been busy, please! - No. You know what? We're gonna talk about this right now. I'm not going anywhere until you tell me what the fuck makes you think you can pull this shit. Look. I said I was sorry about what happened, okay? - I gotta get these drinks out. - Well, that's too fuckin' bad. You shoulda thought of that before, but you didn't. You know why? You're a fuckin' bitch. Fuck this shit. It's not worth it. You're not worth it. Fuck this waste of time. I'm outta here. - Thanks. - You all right? - Just take it easy, okay? - Yeah. You wanna go home? Uh, no, I already paid for a sitter. - Where do these go? - Sixteen. Wow. What was that all about? So, tell me. What is this story about this motel of yours? What? 'Scuse me! 'Scuse me. Oh, I'm... do you mind? Actually, we're really not supposed to without a permit, so. You know what? Never mind, it's fine. - It's okay. - You sure? Yeah! I mean, what are they gonna do, right? Fine me? Probably, yeah. You know. Can I offer you a beer? Oh, no, no, no, I, um... I should, uh... You know what? Yeah, yeah, I'd love a beer, actually. - Cheers. - Cheers. Scary, huh? Back at the bar, I mean. Let's hope he goes home, sleeps it off, resolves to get his life together and they live happily ever after. Yeah, then the elves and the fairies and unicorns can gather 'round in the enchanted forest for their magical wedding. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Gosh, I haven't done this in ages. What? Sat on the beach at night, fire. Why not? I just... - Can I, um... - You ever notice, when the moon's on the horizon, its light is reflected on the water in a way that it seems like it's coming right to you, which is either a lovely thought or the epitome of narcissism. It could be both. Whew. I guess we don't need this anymore. No, I guess not. Wow, that was intense. - Just came outta nowhere. - I know. - Woo! - Woo. Well... thanks for the beer. Thank you for letting me keep the fire going. Yeah. I'll send you the ticket. Fair enough. All right, well, goodnight. Um, hey, here, take my coat. - Oh, no, no, no; it's okay. - No, no, come on, I insist. You'll get drenched. I mean, it's not like I don't know where you live, right? You sure you don't mind? Okay. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. I'm gonna go, any minute now. There you are. All right. Woo! Okay, goodnight. Okay, goodnight! It's gonna be so much fun. - Oh, I'm sorry. - I know. - Tell him I said hi. - I will. - Bye. - Okay, bye. Any chance of getting it today? Oh, uh... it's gonna be tough. Part just came in. I'll do my best. Are you in a hurry all of a sudden? I was gonna say, uh, maybe I can loan you my truck for the weekend. How far you headed? Two thousand miles. Hey, Spenser. What can I do for you? Uh, actually, I'm looking for the guy you got staying here. Oh. What for? I got his bike in my shop, and I know he's waiting for it, and it's good to go. Okay, um, well... he's not here right now, but I'll be sure to let him know when he gets back. Are you sure? I mean, I know he's itching to get going. Yeah? Okay, uh, absolutely, I get it. Is there anything I can help you with, you know, while I'm here? Oh, uh, no, no, that's okay, I'm just... - just finishing up. - Okay. Kate? Yeah. Would you, um... Oh, you know, it's all right, never mind. Hey, Spenser. Don't be a stranger, okay? You know, I think his bike's ready to go, but I could always be wrong, you know? Whatever. - Hey! - Hey. I just stopped by to tell you, your uh... You seem handy, do you mind... do you mind helping me with something? So was it a short or something? Yeah, I just gotta splice these two together... Whoa! Oh my God, oh! Oh my gosh. - Are you... - I... yeah. ...are you okay? Yeah, that was, that was, um, that was interesting. Is there any way we can pretend you didn't see that happen? Ooh, I'm so... I'm sorry. Look how pretty this water is. Oh, and down there? - Woo! Not bad. - That's incredible. Whoa! That was, like, ten. So how'd you end up down here, anyway? What do you mean? I mean, you know, lawyer from the big city, how'd that... What are you... what are you doing down here? My father was a real, honest-to-goodness fisherman. And my mom died when I was seven, so... my dad sold his boat and he built this place. He worked his tail off so I could have a better life. And? And then I went to college, started a career, got married. Worked like a maniac, got divorced. A better life. And then, my father got sick right around the time my marriage ended. I came down here to take care of him for the last year of his life, and I guess I just... yeah, I guess I just never really left. Do you think your being down here had anything to do with your marriage ending? Probably. But, you know. I still got a good couple years of miserable depression and horrible self-pity out of the whole deal before finally admitting that to myself. - Well, there's that. - Mm. So now you're just determined to keep this place going, come hell or high water. Literally high water on some occasions, yeah. No kids? What would you be doing if you weren't trying to keep this place going? I mean, I could go somewhere where I didn't have to, you know, think about regular customers and payroll and food orders and hapless waitresses, yeah. It's probably not a bad idea. Would you... would you like a cup of tea? Um... no. Oh. Okay. I guess I'll... I guess I'll... Why? Why not? Um... I don't drink tea. I had a really good time with you tonight, and I just kind of should, um... I should be getting back up there, so. So, goodnight. Goodnight. Hey. I have something I just felt like, I don't know, just... I thought I would say I just felt a little weird, I mean, just... Oh! So I'm gonna get going. Kate, what... It's none of my business. It's my daughter. Why didn't you just... - why didn't you just tell me... - Because I knew you'd want to talk about it, and I don't want to talk about it. Okay, I see, yeah, well, too bad, because this whole thing, you know, the whole mystery man thing, the whole enigmatic drifter thing, yeah, that... that's over now. Gonna move on from that part to the part where we start acting like normal adults. How... how does that sound to you? I haven't seen her in 30 years. Why? 'Cause that's when I left her, her and her mother. I dropped out of college, playing in some bands, and I met Audrey's mom at a gig. We hung out for a few weeks and then, she got... we got... Were you in love? We tried. We fought a lot. One night after a particularly brutal blow-up, I got on my motorcycle and I rode to a friend's house. A friend who lives in Texas. At first, I thought I was gonna just stay for a few weeks, blow off some steam just to know that I could. But he offered me a job. Always told myself I was gonna go back. "I'll go back tomorrow." But I never did. Just kept moving, from Austin to Santa Fe, Bozeman, Billings. Anyway, I just always kinda stayed a step ahead of it. I-I-I'm sorry, I-I don't... Okay. I'll see you. You look awful. Thanks. It's nothing. You're the first person I've ever told about my daughter. Why now? I got word Audrey's mom died. So I got the bright idea to hop on my motorcycle and ride across the country and show up on her doorstep as if that would somehow make things better. By the time I got here, I'd barely slept for three days. I went right off the side of the road, into the ocean. What if I went out there with you? And what if we... drove out there together and you just... you stay in the car, see how you feel? But what would I say to her? "How was your childhood, what have you been up to for the last 30 years? Is purple still your favorite color?" All right, all right. I thought I was doing it for her. At least, that's what I told myself. It's not okay if it's for you? I already did that. Well... can you let her decide? You having second thoughts? You think there's any way I could drive? Well, I was gonna... I mean, why? I can't ride in a car as a passenger, I kinda need to be driving. - You need to be? - Kind of, yeah. Okay, uh, well, what happens if you don't... I just... I really don't like it a lot, and... it's something I haven't done - in 25 years. - Wow. Oh, wow, okay. Um... I mean, okay. I mean, other than your now phosphorescently obvious control issues, do you... do you have any other personality disorders that you wanna tell me about at this juncture? No. Okay. Thank you. Your bike is fixed. Spenser came by yesterday. We're looking for 309. 303, 7, we have... there it is, 309. It's cute. You okay? Hello? Hi. Who are you? I'm, uh... I'm... I'm sorry, I have... I have the wrong house. - Molly, honey, who is it? - I don't know! Can I help you? I have... I have the wrong number. Wrong house, I mean, I'm sorry. Who are you looking for? Who are you? I'm... I was just... Oh my God. Molly, can... can you go inside, sweetie? - Is everything okay? - Yeah! Everything's fine. I'll be in in a sec, okay? No, just... you can't do this. You c... How do you even know where I live? Can you tell me what to do here? I don't know what to do. So maybe next time, you call first. Hey. Where are you going? I'm gonna go for a walk on the beach. - Do you want company? - No, it's okay. You sleep. You're leaving, aren't you? What? Here. You're leaving. Have you just been sitting there waiting for me to wake up? Mm-hm. For how long? Don't try to change the subject. I'm trying really hard. Not to go? Well, if you're looking for honesty points, you may be waiting awhile. - Hi. - Hello. Can I help you with something? Um... hi, yeah. I... I'm actually a friend of your father's. Uh, I don't have a father, so if you'll excuse me, - I'm kinda busy. - Wait, wait... please. Just five minutes. Please? Could you give me just five minutes? And then I'll go, I promise. The truth is, I'm not... I'm not really sure what to say. I... - Are you his... girlfriend? - No. - Did he send you here? - No, no, I just... He's come a long way to see you, across the country to find you. Well, he also must have gone a long way to get away from me. Look, I mean, I can't imagine what this is like for you, or what it's been like for you, but I... Look, I think in spite of... - I think he's a good... - Really? Do good men just walk out on their families, never to be heard from again? I don't know. Actually, I... What's in this for you? Wait. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Are you really my grandfather? Yes. Well, where've you been - all this time? - Molly! What? Hey, Molly, can I ask you a huge favor? I am trying to come up with a new ice cream sundae to serve at the restaurant, but I have nobody to do taste-testing. Do you think you could help me out? Yes! Okay. Yay! Oh, jeez. Sorry about your mom. Oh. Yeah. Was she sick for a long time? No, not really. Guess we have that to be thankful for. You don't look the way I remember you. Time plays tricks, huh? Yeah, it does. Lucky for you you look like your mom. Careful, that rock looks slippery. It's fine I got it; shoe just slipped off. Ahhh... some things never change. What does that mean? Even when you were little, you wouldn't even let someone hold your hand crossing the street. Careful! You're gonna... you gave it a nine, I gave it an eight. Molly. Hey, Mom! Can we go to the beach and search for seashells? She said we could. That's not true; I said, you ask your mom, and if she says, it's okay. - Can we? - No, sweetie, we gotta go. Okay. Now, remember, that recipe is super top secret. - Deal? - Deal. - All right. - Handshake? Next time! - Bye! - Bye, Audrey. Well... Call, uh, if you want, or... - you need anything. - Sure. Um, it was nice meeting you. Bye! Your clutch cable got frayed. I didn't see it till this morning. Might have been when you wrecked. I know you're headed a long way, I'd hate to send you out there with it like that. I could probably have it ready for you by tomorrow. A splash for your thoughts. Hm? Warm that up for you? Oh, sure, yeah. - Thanks a lot. - Mm-hm. Shit! Oh! What? Ugh, God. Oh, God, okay... hold on a second. It's Audrey. Sorry, I didn't know who to call. Yeah. - Mom, it stopped! - She said it stopped. Okay. Will you hand me that red wrench right there? Thank you. Ah. That should do it until at least the real plumber can take a look at it. Oh. Then you can get fancy and go... Crazy, huh? - Can I try? - Yeah, just make sure that this one's on the second string on the first fret. Like that? Yeah, yeah, um, yeah. Just move one finger up here and you get a C. That's it, did you hear that? Really, that's it? Yeah, you got it, Hendrix. Who's Hendrix? Uh, nevermind, just a very cool dude. Oh, hey, Mom, listen. - It's like this. - Yeah. - Think I lost it. - No, you got it. You just have to practice every single day, and that guitar's just way too big for you. Molls, have you done your homework? It's almost dinnertime. No, but can I try - just a little longer? - Nope. Homework first. All right, I guess that's enough for today. Um, would you like to stay for dinner? Oh, I, I, uh, I wouldn't wanna impose, or... Well, she... We would like you to. Well, um, yeah. Yes, that would be great, thank you. Well, that was incredible. I cannot tell you the last time I had a home-cooked meal. Glad you liked it. - So is Kate your girlfriend? - Molly! What? Um, I don't know. Well, I like her. All right, kiddo, time for you to get ready for bed. Okay. - Bye! - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Thank you. Night! Should I call an electrician? - Nope. - Why not? 'Cause it's fixed. Wow! Very impressive! - Ms. McConnell. - Yes? Anita Evans. How are you today? I am fine. What can I do for you? I would love to share some information with you that I think you will find - very interesting. - Okay, I'm sorry. I gotta stop you right there, if this is about selling, I'm gonna tell you the same thing I told the guy who came by last month, and the month before that. I am not interested. I thought you would say that. That's why I'm here, to let you know that they have substantially increased the amount that they had - offered before. - It's not about the money. Knowing as I do that you care about the fate of your employees, we are willing to put in writing a guarantee - to place anyone who wants... - I know you're only trying to do your job, but can you please relay the message back? I'd really appreciate it if you would stop sending people out here. It's starting to become a little frustrating. - Yup. - All right. - I'm sorry. - Oh, no, that's... It was nice meeting you. Nice to meet you as well. Uh, can I just leave my business card with you? - Just in case. - Sure. - There you are. - Thank you. - Have a good day. - All right, you too. What was that all about? Oh, the country club next door, they keep offering me way too much money for this place so they can, you know, knock it down and expand their golf course. Really? And, uh... And? And I'm not interested. How come? What do you mean? Don't you think it's worth at least listening to... It's my home, you know, I grew up here. The people that come in here, I mean, the people that work for me... I don't know, I... You know, this town used to be, it used to be different. People who lived here, they actually worked, you know, with their hands, right? It's not like they, they drive into the city every morning and make a fortune off of moving other people's money around, and then come back out here to enjoy the peace and quiet of their McMansions? I mean, this is, this is the only place you can still get a decent cup of coffee and afford a meal without, you know, taking out a second mortgage. Hm. "Hm," what "hm"? Just seems like you're trying to stop some kind of... some inexorable force, like time or the tides. All right, take it easy. I'm just sayin'. Yeah, well, my... my father would have wanted me to... - I don't know. - Have you considered the possibility that that debt has been paid? I'm sorry, that was... that was outta line. Mm, it's okay. You guys get out to the ocean much? Not that much, actually. How 'bout you? Nah, not... you know, I'm kinda stuck out there in the desert, you know. Right, right, of course. I don't know, what do you think, does it need more salt? Well, I think everything - needs more salt. - I know, but... - Is it too hot? - No, that's - really good actually. - Really? - Yeah. - Okay. Careful, sweetie, it's hot, okay? Looks weird. Weird? What do you mean it looks weird? I don't know, like, gloopy. Gloopy? Are you kidding me with the gloopy? This is sauce! Look at that, the gloops are tomatoes. Okay, you like spaghetti though, don't you? - Of course! - You come into my kitchen, you insult the chef. I don't know where you're from, lady. All right, uh... Hi, can I, can I steal Molly for a second? Molly. This was gonna wait for your birthday, but... - Open it. - Yay! Now you get to pick on someone your own size. Wow, that's really... You shouldn't have, we can't... Please, can I keep it? Sure. - Thank you. - Don't thank me! Thank you. That Molly's really somethin'. She's somethin' all right. Just not sure what. She's got more spirit in her little finger than... So Kate's pretty great. Wow! Look at that. Never seen a star that bright. Actually, it's not a star. What do you mean? That's Venus. Really? By far the brightest planet seen from Earth. - Huh. - Know what's really weird? Its days are longer than its years. How so? It spins so slow it orbits the Sun faster than it can make one whole rotation on its axis. Seriously? Wow, that's bizarre. Two hundred and forty-three of our days just to spin once. And I thought I'd seen some long days. Can't tell you how strange it is to be standing with you right now. Can I ask you something? Anything. Did you and my mom ever talk after the, um... 'Bout a year after I left, I called her. I said I wanted to come back and see you. And she said no. I said she couldn't do that, that I was gonna get a lawyer, but I knew I didn't really stand a chance. And she said please, it would just be too disruptive for you and for her, and she was right. Did she ever talk about... me, or... Mm-mm. Can I ask about Molly's dad? Let's just say, uh, she's not the product of a long-term committed relationship. He take off? No, no, I mean, he's around. If I wanted him to be, he'd... He's harmless. That's the best thing I can say about him. Yeah, for the life of me I just can't figure out why I have so much trouble in my relationships with men. Was that a joke? It's good. It's good! Mom, look, I'm winning! She's very, very fast. Eat your lunch, sweetie. - Just one second. - No, not just one second. Put the guitar down and eat. How long 'till he gets here? Eat! Do you wanna, um... Ugh. Molly, sit! But I'm really not hungry. Fine, fine, I give up. Hey! Aren't you... aren't you supposed to be at Audrey's? What if I'm the same person? - Same as what? - That I was. When? What reason do I have to believe that I'm any different than I was before I left? That was 30 years ago. Can't do this to 'em. - Do what? - To make 'em care, Audrey, Molly, I can't do it to... It's not... It's not fair, not if I'm - the same person that I... - Goddammit! Just don't be! Some people don't even get one chance. All your unicorns with you? Why don't we go into town and get some ice cream? It's okay. - I'm sorry I'm late. - You were supposed to - be here an hour ago. - I, I know, I got delayed, - I'm sorry! - Yeah, well, we gotta go. - What about the lesson? - Mom, please? - We gotta go, get in the car. - No, no, please, please, come on. Audrey, what time are you gonna be back? I don't know. I'm so sorry, I'm here now. - Mom! - Right, I'm... Audrey, I'm sorry. - Molly, I'm... - No, Mom! Mom, he's here, look! - Hey, Sam! - Hey! Honey, can you go inside? - Please, Mom! - Just go inside. It's wet, come on. I'll be in in a sec. - Look, I think it's be... I know. - I'm sorry, I really tried to... I know, I know you tried, but I just think we should quit while we're ahead, you know. I, I don't think I can be fair to you... ...and I just, I can't afford, I can't afford with... I... Okay. Excuse me. What is it you want me to do? Hm, do you want me to stay here and just make things up - as I go along? - So what was all this then? I mean, some now you see me, - now you don't? - Yes, no, I don't know! I don't know what this is! All right. All right, hey, look, this is not easy for me either. What isn't? - Leaving. - Really? 'Cause you're so good at it. You still serving? Called last call like a half hour ago. Sorry. You just want that one drink? Yeah. Guess I can give you one. Let the rain die down a little bit. I gotta break down anyway. Want a beer? Bourbon. One of those nights, huh? Couldn't sleep? Somethin' like that. I know the feeling. Cheers. I don't know, it's like... we like being with each other a real lot, but... Listen to me goin' on to you like this. A total stranger. You seem like a nice guy. What's a nice guy like you doing in a place like this? Was it always like that? Even when you first met? Um... not really, no. I mean, kind of yes, kind of no. It was better. I'll just say that. But with me workin' two jobs and him workin' three... ...there's not a whole lot of... I mean, we don't really even see each other that much, so... That can't help. No, it can't. Thanks for the drink. No problem. Are you okay? Yeah. Hi. Hi. You're not like some weirdo creep that I should be worried about, are you? I mean, you don't seem like it. It's just that I'm not really in the habit of being in motel rooms with strange men. I don't know if... ...I think it's just a really weird time, you know, with my boyfriend. Hey, why the long face? What? Sergio, I'll be right back! Someone's at the door. What? Someone's at the door. - Nevermind, I'll get it. - No, no, wait! Kate. Maureen, uh, uh. I'm sorry, I just came to drop... - Okay. - ...this stuff. Sorry, I, uh... Kate, can we please just... There's really nothing to say, okay? It was a little awkward when I came in to drop off your coat 'cause you had company, but it's - no big deal. - Look, is there some place where we could talk in private - just for a minute, please? - Okay, then will you let me get back to work? I promise. So what did you wanna say? Look, what you saw wasn't what it looked like. - I mean, it was, but it wasn't. - Okay, you seem to feel like you owe me some sort of explanation, and you really, you don't. I don't feel like... that I need to... Oh, hey, Amber, what is it, hon? Oh, um, there's a kind of like a whole tour bus of people - that just pulled in. - Okay, great, why don't you just go ahead and get 'em seated, - I'll be right out, yeah? - Okay. I don't even belong here in this town. I got 2,000 miles to ride home, - and I didn't plan on... - Well, you don't have to worry about me slowing you down, okay? Look, I... She was just, she was upset. That's why you fucked her, so you were comforting her? This is what you do? You're taking care of her, that's very heroic. - Are you fucking kidding me? - We didn't sleep together. We, I mean, we, we stopped. - We slept, we fell asleep. - Oh. Aw, how touching. What you said to me wasn't exactly... I was, - I was angry. - So, so this is what you do when you're angry? That's good to know. The truth is, Kate, I didn't know how else to leave you. You gotta come. Okay, okay, I got it. - Chop, chop, chop. - Thank you. Jesus, Amber! I gotta get to Spenser's. Hey! You're a lousy cook. You know what really pisses me off about the whole "When the going gets tough, I get going" thing of yours is that it ends up making me seem like someone I'm not I was fine, I really was before you showed up like some fucking piece of driftwood. I mean, you do understand that, don't you? In my worst nightmare, I could never have imagined I'd screw up Audrey's life any more than I already had. If you and I were to... I'd have to know I was movin' toward something, and not away from it. We both know if you leave here we're never gonna see each other again. I'd like you to stay tonight. Here, with me. Are you sure? Yeah. I am. Hey, I told Spenser you'd be by today. Remember to check your oil now and then. Saw some around the seal. Topped it off for you. If you were around longer, I'd fix it for you. Of course. She's a nice lady, isn't she? I mean, kinda funny her bein' by herself. I guess in a small town like this, it's kinda... Good luck to ya. Thank you. Twenty dollars and 73 cents is your change, sir, and hope you enjoyed your stay with us, and hope that you'll keep us in mind for any future travel plans. Is this really how you wanna do this? Well, the really sad thing is that this is me doing the best that I can. - It's probably best that you... - Why can't we? Because I can't. That's why. Hey, um... ...I'm hittin' the road, and, uh, I know it might not mean that much to you, but I wanted to say... ...I'm really sorry. Thank you so much for letting me see you. It was more than I ever could have hoped for. The timing was off. That guy's, um, motorcycle, the engine. You remember, we would listen, you and I, as they drove past, and we knew just by the sound of the motor, we knew if something was wrong. I got to a point where I could tell every time one drove past what the problem was. Ugh, I couldn't wait for the next one. I wanted so badly not to be wrong. And you'd look at me, and you'd say, "You got it, kiddo. You got it, kiddo." To this day, every time I hear a motorcycle. You know, here's what I don't get, like, what I don't understand, and what I've tried to all these years, and I just can't, like, weren't we just pals? I mean, we would tease each other and joke around, and I helped you fix your bikes. And not just, like, most parents and their kids, even more, we were like best friends, you know? Right? I mean, that's how I remember it. Did I just make that up? Then how, like how? I'm just... I'm just so fucking mad at you, you know? I'm so fucking mad at you. Are you okay, Mom? Uh, yeah, I'm fine, sweetie. I'll be in in a sec, okay? Look, I should go. I forgot my toothbrush? So, funny ironic story. Just before you came back, I was actually thinking about trying to get away for a little bit. - Really? - Yeah, I don't know, like, try to figure out a way to go away somewhere to clear my head and think about what I wanna do and... figure out what I wanna do with this place. I don't know, I just feel like I have been stuck for too long now, and, you know, I'd love to just get some perspective or something. Where? I don't know. For how long? I don't know, few weeks, maybe? Have you ever been to Taos? Yeah! Actually, yeah, my best girlfriend and I took a road trip there after high school. I absolutely loved it. Well, look at this, uh, - that's where I got this. - Oh, my God. How did I not see that? You know, I got a place there that you could stay at. Wait, what? - Where? - Taos. What are you talking about? I have a place that you could go stay at in Taos. Are you being... - Are you serious? - Why not? Yeah. So, wait, so you're saying you have a house where I could stay all by myself? That's what I'm sayin'. Yeah, but what... No, what about this place? I mean, the restaurant, getting it ready for the season and everything? Well, just show me the ropes and I can, I can spiff it up, and hold down the fort 'till you get back. Wait, are you... wait a minute, are you... you're being serious? Of course! Oh, my God, I would... I would really love to do that. And, you know, you'd... you'd actually still be here when I get back? - You'd have to wait and see. - Oh, my God, this is crazy! I mean, is this for real? 'Cause I'm getting extremely excited. Look who's here.
