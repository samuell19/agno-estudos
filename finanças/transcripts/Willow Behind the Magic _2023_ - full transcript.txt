DIRECTOR: Three, two, one, action! (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (GRUNTS) (LAUGHTER) JADE: Kit! (LAUGHS) (CRACKLING) - (MEN GRUNTING) - (GASPS) - (GRUNTING) - (AIR HISSING) - Hi, I'm Erin Kellyman. - I'm Ruby Cruz. - I'm Tony Revolori. - I'm Ellie Bamber. - I'm Dempsey Bryk. - I am Amar Chadha-Patel and this is your look at the behind the scenes of the making of... ALL: Willow. (WILLOW THEME PLAYING) Starting about, I don't know, ten years after the movie was released, a week would not go by without somebody wanting to talk about Willow. (INTERVIEWER SPEAKING) Mm-hmm. First thing I did with George was Return of the Jedi. And then, I'd done the Caravan of Courage and Battle for Endor. And then, I went on to do Labyrinth which George was involved in (LAUGHS) again. AMAR CHADHA-PATEL: I read an interview about Willow, where George Lucas had said that when he'd met Warwick on the set of Star Wars that he wanted to make a story where the hero was unlikely and not what you would expect a hero to be. SARAH YOUNG: So I watched the original to refresh my memory of everything and all the characters and kind of, to remember how fun it was and how... I mean, how iconic it was, actually. INTERVIEWER: How many times have you worked with George? - It's my third one. - INTERVIEWER: What were the other two? Uh, I did Raiders of the Lost Ark. And, um, Indiana Jones. And, of course, this one. He's killed me four times in three films. He doesn't like me. I feel like it's a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. (BOTH SCREAMING) Excuse me, are we having a party? - (CHUCKLES) - Huh? You have this incredible experience, which I did, on the film and Ron Howard, directing, George Lucas, producing. It's my first real movie and it's this giant, epic production. It was out-of-this-world and extraordinary. I was captivated by it. I was captivated by Warwick, and by Joanne, and by Val Kilmer. Obviously. We were all just absolutely obsessed with it. You know, it was successful when it came out, it was well-regarded. But it, you know, it didn't have this, sort of, place in pop culture. I sort of tended to gravitate toward the idea that, while, like, Indiana Jones and Star Wars were the biggest things ever, there was this other thing. There was Willow. HOWARD: George Lucas had always wanted, not so much to do a sequel, but to develop it further on television. And when Disney Plus came along, suddenly we felt like, well, there's a real home for this. To all the fans who've waited over 30 years, the wait is over. Kasdan from his original conversations with Ron Howard, he's been kind of building this world up and bringing his own kind of sensibility, humor, and heart. It has nostalgia, of course, for those of us that love the original movie. But it feels so fresh and modern and he has managed to bring it into a brand new moment in time. So there's this specificity to Willow and to the Lucasfilm brand. And so, my mind kept going to this, like, dusty volume sitting on a shelf somewhere with "Willow" on its spine. And like, I wanted to write more of that book. Jon Kasdan encourages a very inventive and bold approach. But he also respects the skills and the different qualities each cast member brings. BAMBER: I think as a new cast, there is pressure stepping in and taking over, like, such a beloved story. (LAUGHTER) PATERSON: Reading the scripts and getting a sense of the premise for the show, this thing was gonna live or die according to the cast. So I was kinda nervous about meeting the new team, as it were. And they're so brilliant, they're so brilliant. It's been a joy, a genuine joy working with them. The repartee that is between them, that isn't something anyone needs to direct. Uh, it's been a crazy day. We've had a lot of... - KELLYMAN: Where? - REVOLORI: It's that way. - KELLYMAN: What? - Lot of horse work going on today. - Uh... - I think... No. - Amar, you gettin' on? Ruby? - CHADHA-PATEL: No, I'll get the next one. - Oh. - Okay. (INHALES) As you can see, a lot of horse work going on. BRYK: I met Ruby, who plays Kit, who's my twin, on a FaceTime. - Oh, hey there. What's up? - CAMERAMAN: Hey. And within two seconds I said, "I think I know you." And then, progressively person, by person, by person who I met, we all kinda said the same thing. (LAUGHS) These people are my family. I've been with them for so long. (LAUGHS) When we're all six of us are together, like, that's always very fun, you know. (LAUGHS) Um, we can never get anything shot, but it's very fun. WILLOW: (ECHOING) Reach out to me. INTERVIEWER: What was it like working with Warwick Davis? Um... (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) Warwick has a lot of passion. Like, well, like a, like a lot of passion. (CHUCKLES) Really passionate. He has so many great ideas. (BREATHES DEEPLY) Warwick is, uh... (CHUCKLES) He's very... intense. Can we get this thing towed at owner's expense, please? He just has ideas. He has a lot of ideas. Um... For everyone about everything. Whether you want them or not. How's that? He likes to remind people he's number one on the call sheet which is... which is helpful, I think. Quiet, please. Don't wanna do this twice. And three, two, one. I'm Warwick Davis and I play Willow. (GRUNTS) Hang on. No, do it again. That was rubbish. CHRISTIAN SLATER: We have some of the best hair people, makeup people, set designer people who have put such a show together that I have come in here and I'm just blown away at the level of detail. KELLYMAN: I really liked the troll set. It was cool to walk around in there, it's very easy to actually get lost. It's a whole thing as well. It's a real maze. It's not just one tiny, little corner that everyone squeezes into. They built a whole thing. ROB BREDOW: This is a great crew. Everybody from art department, um, who've been looking at creative ways to accomplish everything you see behind us. And then the things you can't see is what visual effects is gonna do later. We have Industrial Light & Magic on to supervise all the visual effects for this work. Um, this is gonna be epic, even though this is already an epic location. Instead of being this height, it's gonna be five or ten times taller when we get into visual effects world. MARK BAKOWSKI: So we're in Bavmorda's chamber or High Tower, That's where the climax of Willow 1988 happens. We see our characters from 1988 and they interact with our characters from 2021. We looked in the archives to try and find out um, what suitable angles would help tell the story. So try to line up whatever footage we had with the POVs and made sure that our characters from 2021 were in the right position, so they would line up with the footage that we have to hand. So I'd imagine it'll take our team about three or four months to pull this together and see 'em in this environment. DAVIS: And seeing these sets reconstructed for the series has been quite somethin' as well. 'Cause I believe that most of this location in the movie was a painting. In the original movie, this dais part was the only thing that existed. The rest of it was a matte painting. Kristian and his team did an incredible job. We wanted to have it very similar to what it looked like in the movie. - (LAUGHS) - WOOLFENDEN: And Neal Scanlan and the creatures department are legendary. They've worked with Lucasfilm and ILM a lot on various Star Wars projects. The attention to detail is wonderful within the creature department. You get a drawing, you get a maquette, you get a full size sculpt. You're given a chance to give notes to discuss possibilities of how it'll look for real. Uh, to me, workin' on Willow has been really demanding, actually. Creating new characters and starting afresh was amazing and to find solution to what Jon was writing was really fun. SCANLAN: Three, two, one, action! MAN: Going down. (SPLASHES) CHADHA-PATEL: Yeah, the creatures are amazing. Actually, my favorite creatures were the, um, the wererats. - Okay, look out for the wererats. - KIT: What? See ya. CHADHA-PATEL: Kit and Boorman go on a little side quest in episode three and we get attacked by wererats and there was this crazy, two-headed rat that attacks Kit while I'm down a well, and just doing my own thing. Um... And the puppetry was, I mean, it's classic CFX. Like, fully armatured puppets with moving parts and fingers and eyes and it looked so creepy and real. It was covered in slime and gross. I loved it. When I met my first troll, I was totally gob smacked. (CHUCKLES) Uh, the detail that Neal had put into the face, the wrinkles, everything. Even the little warty things that they had on their bodies. Uh, people always ask me, you know, do I use Stanislavski or Meisner. Which I always tell them is a trick question because there would be no Meisner without Stanislavski. LOWTHORPE: And, Pippa, the makeup designer, as well, I think her work is awe-inspiring. I think she brings a wonderful naturalism to everything she does. We thought we'd bring the world to life with all of our backgrounds. Backgrounds have got all the interesting hair and everything like that. Like our Tir Asleeners we could go quite far with. We needed our heroes to be really relatable. We needed everyone that watches it to kinda go, "Oh, that... I kinda... I could be that person, that could be me," you know? (DAVIS SPEAKING) - (MAN LAUGHS) - KASDAN: Oh. Yeah. I was telling the crew how you do everyone's makeup except your own, - which is virtually impossible. - DAVIS: Mmm. I'd say Warwick is very hands-on. Yeah. I think... hands-on is a good way of describing it. DAVIS: I'm a perfectionist. Every tiny detail on the film set matters. And I wanna be part of that. (MACHINE WHIRRING) KASDAN: I mean, the guy has an incredible work ethic. He's involved in wardrobe, makeup, production design. He's our on-set medic, which is weird because he doesn't really have any medical background or training at all. Part of me thinks it is very irresponsible and also weird that he's chosen to be the medic. But then, on the other hand, I was chokin' on a chicken bone. And he did save my life, so. And then, you know, there's the transportation thing which is that he insists on picking up all of the actors at their homes. The actors appreciate it but, weirdly, like, he'll do it for all of them. Except for Ellie. Seems to be like actively sabotaging her call sheet. AMANDA: Yeah. Lovely. Thanks, Warwick. That's great. Thanks, Amanda. Um, so we're gonna do a few now with Ellie, if that's okay. - Oh, yeah. - So, yeah, where is she? Where's Ellie? No idea. - (DOOR THUDDING) - BAMBER: Hello? It's locked from the outside. Hello? We got some great ones of me, didn't we? - AYARU: Yes. Yours was... - Yeah. AYARU: Thank you. Yeah, no, they were great. Well, this is Willow, after all. So, uh, that's all you need. - AYARU: Absolutely, yes. - Good. I think we were most excited about continuing the story of Elora Danan who, of course, we only saw as a baby and is now moved into the central role of this series. WOOLFENDEN: This is the baby that he saved. This is the person that he, sort of, lost. She's back. REJWAN: I remember we sat down with Warwick and told him that Elora Danan would finally be in this story and become the central character. And his response immediately was, "Why?" I genuinely, actually think Warwick is a bit like, intimidated by Ellie? I don't wanna say (GULPS) that it's sabotage. But, but it is. It's sabotage, I think. (CHUCKLES) No, that's ridiculous. Are you kidding? Warwick really likes me. I think, maybe, at one point, he got the idea that... Oh. I wanted to call the show Elora Danan - and he heard about that... - Oh. Okay, Ellie. We're ready for you on set now. Thank you, Alec. MAX TAYLOR: A major through line in season one is Elora Danan learning to become more powerful than Willow as a sorcerer. Uh, so the fact that her wands kept disappearing from set was unsubtle and problematic. I think Warwick's been snappin' Ellie's wands. In fact, I know he has. We've got security cameras. (CHUCKLES) Wait for it. Okay. Look, look, look. Okay, look! There's the snatch. There's the snap. See? Do you know how many wands we've gone through? Must be like, 37. What the (BLEEP)? - Right. Okay. - CC SMIFF: Then we get to the jump. The horse is blind, he doesn't know where he's going. - He doesn't know where he's going. - SMIFF: And here we go, three, two, one. BOTH: Hsu-gala! SMIFF: Thank you so much. You did a great job today. Thank you very much. Hi, are you all right? (INTERVIEWER SPEAKING) Yeah, definitely. Hi, how do you do? SMIFF: We're gonna have a body land, - boom, on the floor! - MAN: Bang! PATERSON: CC and his team did a fantastic job, you know, all of the actors were doing all of their own work in there which is sensational. We put the cast through an awful lot of, um, physical rigor (CHUCKLES) on this shoot. KELLYMAN: Oh, (BLEEP). - Are you okay? - Yeah. All good. - These actors, I gotta say. - They're so great. - I mean, it's been incredible - And so game. to watch them grow. Seeing them fight so well. DAVIS: Yeah, we have a great young cast. Ellen, Mario, Dennis... And there's Tommy. Arianna. And Robin. And they're all relatively, uh, good in the show. The big fellow is a bit of a klutz, though. CHADHA-PATEL: We have an amazing stunt team, obviously. Luke, my stunt double, he's an incredible sword fighter, and he teaches me how to sword fight. The beauty of it is that he'll teach me these moves that are incredible but when I do them, I make 'em look bad 'cause I'm, I'm like a grasshopper. From my side of it, we've got horses in there, we've got trolls, we've got falls, we've got fights everywhere. There's sword fights everywhere. And I'm havin' a great time. (WHISTLES) Amazing! CC and the team, I mean, these guys are the best in the biz. And they're doing a great job. BRYK: They, essentially, design the fights in a way where it's everything that we're capable of. They don't really put anything in that us as actors can't do. So we're able to really do it and get into it 'cause they're incredible. I can't speak highly enough about them. So, we're really just lucky. CHADHA-PATEL: Dempsey Bryk as Airk. "Bryk" by name, "brick" by nature. He's been my rock. He and I have been gym partners. (LAUGHS) REVOLORI: We've all had to train. We did a, a month of boot camp. I'm very grateful for the month-long boot camp that we got to do (CHUCKLES) because I would've... Oh. It would've been tragic if I wasn't training. But it was really physically demanding. Probably the most physically demanding thing I've ever done. But so paying off. Like, I can't believe I know how to sword fight now. It is the coolest thing. Joanne, who plays Sorsha, loved coming out and playing in the Gales fight. And she absolutely has to front it out with the Doom. (HORSE WHINNIES) (SNARLING) (MAN YELLS) WOOLFENDEN: With these magical whips, whipping back and forth at her. (THE DOOM GROWLS) Sorsha has the weight of the world on her shoulders because she's starting to see things and hear things. - And then, the Death Dogs appear... - (DEATH DOGS BARKING, GROWLING) and she knows that if the Death Dogs are around then it's all gonna kick off. Death Dogs. And I have to get my sword out that I have put away. It's really fun doing a fight again. I haven't had a fight for ages. (CHUCKLES) It's really fun. MAN: I can assure you, whatever's out there, my knights are, are more than capable... SMIFF: You were a bit early there, Martin. - MARTIN: Yep. I'm sorry about that. - SMIFF: Let's just reset Martin. - You can do it separately. - (WHALLEY LAUGHS) It was so fun. Now, people watching this may think that this was all shot against a green screen. In fact, we are actually out here on the beach, in the elements, shooting this for real. We really wanted to create our own world. It needs to be fantastical and have that kinda slightly other-worldly feel to it. Welcome to the Bone Reaver encampment. We're in the Forest of Dean. Very special place. SIMON BIGGS: It's basically an area that was a woodland once and it's collapsed, it's mines underneath and, a cave system. And it's all collapsed. A lot of it is not us, it's all natural, but we've put in the doors. All the timber work. If you look carefully, there's a load of skulls and just hidden around. So, as we're goin' around, you can just see all the details. We tried to stay clear of using real Medieval architecture. We didn't use any real castles. We do have one or two ruins, uh, one of them being Neath Abbey which, uh, the heroes run through in the beginning of episode five. (GRUNTS) We're not in Europe and we're not even in the Medieval times. We are in a fantasy world. So the Willow production being based entirely in Wales has been great for us. PATERSON: There's something mythic about the Welsh countryside that isn't the same as anywhere else. You know, we're making a road movie, obviously. So, we need to find a lot of places that feel, kind of, distinctly different and can progress in a distinct way. I think the biggest benefit is the diversity of locations. And having wide-open space, so close to the studio. Within one hour of Cardiff, you can shoot on beaches, in forests, by lakes, up valleys, in mountains. It's been an awesome experience to get the camera, the crew, the cast into the most amazing places. DAVIS: I've got many fond memories of filming in Wales on the first film. So I think it was great that we went back to Wales for the series. Basically, we had to go back there again. (BOTH GRUNTING) MADMARTIGAN: Willow... Let's ride. (SHUDDERS) You know, after the first Willow came out, I was on fire. KASDAN: The first movie went to his head a little bit. I mean, to be totally honest, I think he perceives it as more successful than it actually was. I had big ideas. Big ideas, I'm tellin' ya. He pitched me maybe, 20 ideas for Willow sequels. None of them really made any sense. I invented the colon. (INTERVIEWER SPEAKING) Yeah, the colon. Basically allows you to make the same movie over and over again. You take the title, put a colon after it, give it another title. I wrote loads of them. Willow, colon, Bavmorda's Revenge. Willow, colon, Lost in New York. Willow, colon, Spring Break, colon, Miami Beach. That's a double colon, that one. Willow, colon, Willow's Colon. which was a public service film about gastrointestinal health. Very important. In his mind, he thought he was creating the world's first mega franchise. That wasn't a thing. DAVIS: There was a lot of opportunity for me in those days. I was getting offered some exciting roles up against some of the biggest actors in Hollywood. And that's, uh, that's when I met him. The weasel. What can I say, I'm just thrilled to be a part of it. The coup and the ultimate score for our show was getting Christian Slater to come in and play Allagash. And the cast was excited. Disney was excited. Warwick was less excited. It turned out, they had a long and complicated history. The Warwick Davis-Christian Slater rivalry. That... That was the stuff of Hollywood legend. He stole my idea. We were mates. I took him out to lunch, told him about this passion project I'd been working on between Willows. It was about this sexy DJ in Brixton, London, called Would You Mind Turning Up The Music, Please? And six months later, saw a movie poster for a film, rather rudely entitled, Pump Up The Volume. He basically accused me of plagiarism. In his version of events I, what, uh, stole his idea, hired a writer and director, made the movie and released it in theaters in like six months? I mean, how would that even work? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) But, uh, man, he was pissed. He, uh, he came at me, hard. What? That's what he said? I came at him hard? Can you imagine that? I'm British. I don't do things like that. I'm a gentleman. (CLICKS) (DAVIS SPEAKING ON RECORDING) Yeah, he threatened to sue me in the most English way possible. And sadly, we never spoke again after that until this. The Disney team have been looking at the dailies and they're so excited about Christian and what season two could be like if you guys are like, you know, like, buddies and, like, on an adventure. - You seem like you're shaking your head. - Whoa. Wait a minute. If they put Christian Slater on Disney Plus, they're gonna have to change the name to Disney Minus. (GRUNTS) Hey, guys. Yeah. - Good to see you. - (KASDAN CHUCKLES) - It's good to have you here. - Yeah. Thanks, man. No, it's great to be here. They finally arrive at the silent, burnt-out ruins. REVOLORI: The beauty of the series is that it really walks this fine line between being funny as it should be and this kind of dramatic fantasy that we've kind of grown accustomed to with Game of Thrones and such, while also keepin' it contemporary in a way that's fresh and new. And it really all just kind of stems from the mind of Jon Kasdan who is our show runner and writer. Jon Kasdan is a very special man. I think Jon is one of the most creative individuals I've ever met. The way he sees this world as something that is just as valuable now as when it was created. SLATER: You know, Jon has been wonderful in allowing us to come in, you know, and to have some fun with it and be loose with it, and I think that is the right energy for this type of story. ALLAGASH: (SINGING) I'm free... - KIT: This guy's insane. - (ALLAGASH GROANS) This must be like a dream come true to Jon. To have eight hours to explore your childhood adventures with this massive great team and this wonderful cast. Willow! I said yes and came aboard 'cause I didn't wanna shatter his childhood dreams which clearly this represents. This is not nostalgia. It's using the fundamentals of this world, these characters but it's very forward thinking in terms of its sensibilities, uh, and also, the adventure that it creates. CRUZ: I feel like there's something for everyone in this series. There are just so many storylines and characters all weaved together. (LAUGHS) There's definitely been days where I am laughing and crying and screaming all in one day and (CHUCKLES) I mean, it's crazy for my emotional health but it, (LAUGHS) you know, gets it all out. I mean, the beauty of fantasy and sci-fi is that it's not Earth so you can put anyone of any diverse background in what essentially is a world full of dragons and giants. Um, if you can have giants and trolls, why can't you have brown people? (LAUGHS) We talk about the impact that these little moments are gonna have on children and being able to see themselves and think, "Yeah, I wanna be that." I mean, I said this to Jon Kasdan when I first had my meeting, my first meeting with him. You know, Indiana Jones, Han Solo, characters that every kid wanted to be, but as an Asian man, I never saw myself reflected in that way. The comedic rogue with a heart of gold character played by an Asian person so for me it's a huge honor and I'm very excited and hope to bring it to life, and not ruin it and get fired. Which is a possibility. And in about ten seconds, I'm gonna kiss you. So, if you don't want that... Yes, I would... (INHALES) I mean, I would be very into that. (SHUDDERS) So absolutely excited to be able to represent the LGBTQ plus community on screen especially something as wide scale as Disney. I think this is huge. That is... Ah! (CHUCKLES) That makes me so excited. That makes me so happy. I honestly never thought I'd be playing a queer character in a Disney show. I think it's so important for young people to see queer characters on shows. Like, to see it on Disney, too. It's such a big platform and it's gonna reach so many people and if I had that when I was younger I think I'd feel a lot less scared and a lot less intimidated by the thoughts and feelings I was having. And being a queer woman, and playing a queer character on a Disney show (CHUCKLES) is honestly the most insane, it's the most insane thing. I never thought I'd be able to do that. We're Thraxus and you're watching the Disney Plus. (MEN GRUNTING) MAN: That was good. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) CHADHA-PATEL: Okay, Jamie? JAMIE CHILDS: That's the last shot on Willow. KASDAN: Well done, everybody! (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) LOWTHORPE: It has been a joyous experience and I've loved working with such talented people. CRUZ: To become a part of something that is so beloved by so many people and to be able to just extend that world even further into something that even more people can love, I think is a really cool thing. BAMBER: There's lots of comedic moments, there's lots of really tender moments and there's a real journey to go on. It's just not typical, it's not what you would expect, and I think that that is something that is so exciting. You guys are the best! See you. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) SLATER: See you next year! It's turned into like one of the greatest experiences of my career so I, I'm very happy to have said yes. KELLYMAN: I don't wanna leave for real. - INTERVIEWER: I know. - It's not even, like, I know this is an interview but I'm actually so sad. The overriding thing I'll take away is a set that is full of warmth, fun, great characters, lovely people. And a real energy to try and do something a little bit different. The truth is, people thought Warwick was crazy. But the reality is he was just ahead of his time. I mean, yes, he can be difficult, he can be challenging. And he's got a big ego but you know what? He's got an even bigger heart and he brings out the very best in people and they bring out the best in him. And that's what Willow is all about. It's about heart, and it's about friendship, it's about coming together. And magic, it's also about magic. Ellie, this is from Warwick. From Warwick? For me? Are you kidding? Look at the box. Oh. (CHUCKLES, GASPS) A new wand. (LAUGHS) Aw. Aw, he shouldn't have. For me, this has been a dream that I've had for, probably, about 30 years. Every fan of the movie said, "When will you make another Willow? We want a sequel." And Jon here has realized that dream for many millions of people around the world who loved the movie. He always tells us to take in every moment and appreciate all of the little things which I think is why he does all these little things. Like pick us up in the mornin'. He always reminds us that everything can go by in a flash. So to appreciate and love every moment of every day with each other. I mean, Warwick might have been a bit hard on me but at the end of the day I think it's because he believed in me. And now I'm very grateful for that. Look, I may be Warwick Davis, titular character of Willow, massive international movie star with over $14.5 billion in box office revenue and counting. King of the Ewoks, polo buddy to Prince William, yada, yada, yada. But the truth is none of that really matters. What matters is this. What we've created here together is just so much bigger than me. Maybe Willow isn't just one man. Maybe there's a little Willow in all of us. I am Willow. I am Willow? I am Willow. I'm Willow. I am Willow. This has been the greatest adventure of my life. (SIGHS) But, uh, just to be clear, contractually speaking, there is only one Willow. And that's me. (INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) KELLYMAN: Have you seen when he sits on a chair? Like, we've tried to talk about it - and he doesn't want to. - He didn't want to. INTERVIEWER: You have a reputation as a bit of a klutz. (CHUCKLES) No. No, I'm pretty coordinated. I've been doing lot of stunt training for this mother... Very complex fight sequences so... There's a lot of broken chairs on set. - There's a giant easter egg and if you... - CRUZ: Oh! (CHUCKLES) Oh, my... It's okay, he has a problem. Don't draw attention to it. It's a huge problem. He's gonna hurt himself and more than anything he's gonna hurt someone else. Have you seen Warwick? CHADHA-PATEL: What? (LAUGHS) I don't have a problem sitting down. You guys are making this up. Making me... - I feel like you're gaslighting me. - MAN: Okay.
