SCARS OF THE SUN Taiyo no Kizu Hello. I just left the station. Sorry I'm running late. Is she asleep already? No, she's awake. She said it's because today's your birthday. I really feel bad about all this. I had to work overtime. Need anything from the convenience store? Forget all that. Just come home quickly. I will. Where's daddy? Near the station. Did you call the police? I did 5 minutes ago. You! You move too much. What an idiot! Die, you fool! What? Didn't even make a dent in his cheek. There's definitely a limit to an air gun. Nope, he's something. Your fuckin' cheek is just too thick! Hey! Stop it! I said stop it already! Die, old man! What are you doing? Let me go! I'm not the one who started this! I didn't start this! Tell your story at the police station. Hey, Oyama! Call an ambulance! Mr. Katayama, you were fighting Junior High School kids. Don't you think you were being childish? Like I told you over and over again, I wasn't fighting them. It's true we answered a call about a homeless man being attacked... ...but you took matters into your own hands and picked a fight with those kids. I was trying to defend myself. One of them had a knife. I thought my life was in danger. You're exaggerating again. No, I'm not. After all, those kids... - Where are they? - We let them go. Why? They'll just do it again. Hey, first of all they got hurt. I think you'll be in more trouble if they press an assault charge against you. Assault charge? Like I said, they're only middle school kids. Even though they look like adults, they still have minds like kids. Are you okay? I'm fine. I was surprised to hear that you're at the police station. I had no choice. They wanted to hear what happened. You should've pretended not to see it. Just don't get involved. No, I was just... She did a good job, didn't she? She said this one's me. All you have to worry about is how to protect me and your daughter. I know. It won't happen again. I learned my lesson. I'll take her to bed. She's gotten bigger, hasn't she? Ayano missed you so much. Take a day off on the weekends so you can take her out somewhere. You're right. When we were kids, this town was a better place to live. I agree with you. No matter what, I don't want to get involved with youngsters anymore. You wish. Someday soon, little Ayano's going to introduce you to her boyfriend. I hope not. Excuse me. Have a good day. Welcome... Welcome home. What's the matter? I'm so glad. This afternoon when I was shopping, some weird boy was following me. Police Dept. Oh, from last night. What's wrong? It was that boy, the one with the knife. He was following my wife and daughter this afternoon. Are you sure? Yes, I'm pretty sure. Can you tell me his name and address? I can't do that. Why not? We have his information, but he's underage. It's privacy laws. But if you wait until something happens... Sorry, but I can't tell you anything. Sorry... Hello. I called you because there's something bothering me. This morning they found a dead body near the train station's crossing bridge. A dead body? Hang on a second. Sorry... What do you mean? They still didn't know whether it's a suicide or a murder. No one can answer the phone right now. Please leave your message after the tone. Please hang up when you are finished. It's me. I heard something happened near the station. It's not safe out, so don't let Ayano go outside. That's all. Ayano? Ayano? Ayano? Oh, Yoko. Did you get my message? Hey, what's the matter? It's all your fault! Mr. Katayama? I'm Ozaki from the Inasato Precinct. I'm very sorry for your loss, but I need to ask you some questions. Witnesses tell us that your daughter was seen with a 15-16 year old boy. Do you have any idea who that boy is? It must be him. Him? Mr. Ozaki... We caught the boy. He's at the precinct. Mr. Katayama! Outta my way! Please stay out of the way. Get out of my way! You bastard! Let me go! Let me go! Let him cool off. Let me go! Let go of me! You! I'll fuckin' kill you! The funeral for Katayama Ayano, the girl killed by a 15 year old... will held at Minasato temple. The body of the young girl is about to be taken into the family tomb. Her father is the one who is carrying her name plaque. Followed by her mother, who is carrying her photo. According to our findings... Ayano's father and that boy were involved in an altercation earlier. This is believed to be the reason behind this tragic event. That is correct. The suspect was beaten up by Ayano's father. - Beaten up? - Right. The police did not release the information to the media... but two days before Ayano was killed... her father was taken to the police station... because he was caught beating up the boy. I believe this was a case started by violence... and ended with violence. Why do you release that kind of report? I am the victim here, but you made me look like a criminal. That's just the way the mass media spins the story. It's beyond our control. My wife has gone crazy over this. I beg you. Can you do something about this? Mr. Katayama, the police can't interfere with freedom of speech. But this is just unfair. We're the victims and our names are spread all over the media... That boy doesn't even have his name publicized! Excuse me. Wait just a minute! Are you Mr. Katayama? I'm Akatsu, the lawyer for Kamiki Akira, the defendant. Kamiki? What kind of lawyer are you for him? What are you talking about? Do you realize... that the public blames you more for this tragic event than the suspect? In the first place, this happened because you beat up that underage boy. - Just wait a minute. - Mr. Katayama... Excuse me. You're up against a lawyer. Don't take on his challenge. Please take it easy on the mass media problem. It will calm down sooner or later. Let's go. I promise you... Attempted murder? Yeah, I found out about it on the Internet. Two years ago, Kamiki tried to kill a girl. Well then, why did they release him? That's the law for underage kids. Also, two years ago, the lawyer who defended him was that Akatsu guy. This time, because of his age, he won't be tried as an adult. At best, they'll just send him to a juvenile detention center. I want him to be executed rather than going to juvie. I want to kill him with my own hands. I'm used to it now. Our house is surrounded by the media. And people keep pointing their fingers at us. You might be used to it, but what about your wife? I know. I can't stand living here anymore. Then, come to Yokohama. Right now, I'm looking for a drafter for a new project. You and your wife can have a new start in a new city. I don't know... Think nothing of it. You've helped me out plenty of times in the past. Did you see my sister? Didn't you see her this afternoon? Yeah, but she told me she is waiting for her medicine. Maybe, she went home first? No, that's impossible. I'll look for her inside again. THREE YEARS LATER Here. Thanks. Take a break just a little bit. I'm almost done. Just leave him be. He's a workaholic. But... It's because he wants tomorrow off. A day off? Does he have plans? Well, you know. THE BOY WHO KILLED AYANO IS RELEASED AND WILL CHANGE HIS NAME In Kamiki's case, his behavior was good and he showed remorse. We did a psychology test on him and didn't find anything wrong with him. That's why we released him in just a year and 8 months. Even though he killed someone, he gets out in only a year and 8 months? Like I explained before, in case of a juvenile, it can happen that way. Where is he now? Mr. Katayama, I mentioned this before. I cannot give you that information. I'm not asking because I'm curious. I'm the victim here. My daughter was the one who got killed. I understand your feelings, but those are the rules. Excuse me. Mr. Katayama! Nice to meet you. I'm a probation officer. My name is Takizawa. I'm looking over Kamiki Akira's release. Then do you know where he is? I'm not allowed to inform you of his whereabouts... ...but I'll make sure he doesn't repeat the same crime ever again. I want to make sure of that with my own eyes. I believe I have that right. Here... These are the letters of apology that Kamiki wrote, but they all were returned. I feel the same whether or not I read them. I don't even feel like reading them. I heard his parents moved to Tohoku. Is he there? No, he chose not to live with his parents. He said that he wanted to start fresh by himself. Could it be? Is he back in his old neighborhood? Tell me! I can't answer that. I don't mind if you stay here for a month. Use it as you please. This futon is for you to use. Sorry to trouble you. Say Katayama... Yes? I'm sorry to say this, but I can't help you anymore. Not long after the murder... the press came into my store asking for an interview. People around me started to give me strange looks. Caused a lot of trouble. Katayama, I have a family. I don't want mine to get into the same trouble as yours. Taisa, I'm really sorry. I'm very grateful for all you did for me. I couldn't ask for more. I'm so sorry about this. Daddy... Daddy... come play with me. Thank you so much for this. Hello. It's you. It's been so long. Are you doing well? Where are you now? What's wrong? You're back all of a sudden. Definitely, it was because he's been released. I heard the rumor. I called the police, but they won't tell me anything. He has a grudge against me. This time he will try to kill you. Me? Do you have any plans to move to Yokohama? It's better that way. I can protect you if you're nearby. It's you. I was in the Minasato precinct. It's been a while. I've been consulting him since that case. I didn't hear anything about his release... but I will do everything to protect Kaori. What can you possibly do? Brother! The police and the law failed to protect us. So, how can you protect Kaori? Brother... I am grateful that you're worried about me... but I have to take care my students too. I beg you, don't start a fight here. Hey, stop that! What an idiot! I don't have anything to do with Kamiki anymore. That's the truth. It's really getting annoying now. After I got out of juvie... I took over my parents' business, got married and had a kid. That's why... I don't care about you. I want to find out about Kamiki. He doesn't have any parents. Kihara died 3 years ago. And Kawamoto is serving time in prison. The one who left is only you, Sudou. You must know something. I don't know, really. Sorry, I have work to do. Wait! If you remember anything, call me. What the hell are you doing? Somebody! Help me catch that girl! Give it back to me. Give it back! What school are you from? Here. You do have money. I've been saving up. Like you said, my brother should be here. He doesn't believe in the police or the law. If it were me, in order to protect my students... Are you staying over? No. If I fail the test this time, it will be embarrassing. I'm going home to study. I didn't know being a cop was such a hassle. But I want to come over, just for a while. Idiot! Go home and study! All right. Hey! If anything happens, call me. Thanks. Hey, wanna take a lunch break now? Yeah! Ishikawa, it's lunchtime. Thanks. It seemed that you're getting used to the routine here. We have to start teaching you how to ride the wave. Don't just stare at the computer all day. Go to the beach for a change. I will. We allowed Kamiki to return to his hometown... because we believed that he's a completely different person. Kamiki and also Sudou paid their debt to society. So don't disturb their lives. I just want to see Kamiki. But that's impossible. He killed my daughter! I have the right to at least see him. Am I wrong? In terms of your rights or the law, talk to his lawyer. We're just volunteers here. But... Whatever it is, don't come near Sudou anymore. You too! Don't talk with him again. Yes. I'll report this to Sakayama. Why the hell is everybody here protecting a murderer? Ayano and my wife... We're the victims and we're treated like trash. Mr. Katayama... I'll talk to the lawyer. Maybe we can find a solution for all this. Lawyer? Mr. Akatsu, Kamiki's lawyer. I don't have to tell you anything about Kamiki. What? He's already been released and a changed man. You don't have any right to order him around. I just want to know his reason. Why is he returning to that town? That town? Who said that? My sister still lives there. I have the right to protect her. I have the right to know. You don't have that right. Mr. Katayama, if you keep on fussing about this... you'll be the one who will serve time. Are you threatening me? No, I'm warning you. Excuse me. Sorry, I couldn't be of any help to you. Don't worry about it. Thank you. Can you stop here please? Mr. Katayama? Where are you going? I'm going to the places where Kamiki might show up. Mr. Katayama... I'm sorry! Mr. Katayama! Hey, lady... If you don't wanna get hurt, give me your money. What? Are you deaf? If you don't wanna get hurt, give me your money. You're just a kid! Put that thing away! What the hell are you doing? Mr. Katayama, I'm sorry! Hey... Where did you get this? Where!? From a man... A man? Hey! Wait! Is there something bothering you about that knife? It looks similar to the knife Kamiki had. The man that boy was referring to... Could it be Kamiki? It's just your imagination. Kamiki just got out of jail. Surely he won't be hanging around kids like that. I'm not too sure about that. You just don't know. If I track that kid down, maybe I'll find Kamiki. Don't do it! It's too dangerous! Well then, let us meet. If I see that he's a changed man, I can relax. Is that the truth? Yeah. He's changed his name. I can't arrange a meeting... but you can see him from a distance. That's good enough for me. Can you promise me not to talk to him? I promise. The owner of this place, Ichimura, is this guardian. Beside Kamiki, they have two other kids from the juvenile correction center. All of them are living in the dorm in that factory. Mr. Katayama! Mr. Katayama, you're not allowed to do this. Mr. Katayama, please stop this! Mr. Katayama! Mr. Katayama, please don't do this! Hey, Kamiki! Mr. Katayama! What the hell are you doing? I want to talk to Kamiki. There is no person by that name. He's Ishikawa. Well, I want to talk to that Ishikawa. Just for a moment. I'll call the police! I'll have you arrested for trespassing. Mr. Katayama, this is too much. You're Katayama? He's now trying to re-enter society. I beg you, leave him be. Mr. Katayama, please stop it. The rehabilitation plan is ruined now. How the hell are you going to take responsibility for this? I am so sorry. It's not her fault. It's all my doing. It's not because of that. You being in that place is already against the law. Do you have any responsibility as a correctional officer? It has been along time. I heard everything from the lawyer. I understand how you feel... I just wanted to know if he has changed. It was because he changed that he was released. A murderer in that place for 3 years... Do you think he actually rehabilitated? Two years before he killed Ayano, he tried to kill another 8 year old. He already received his punishment. That's in the past. What's in the past? If you really punished him then, Ayano would still be alive. It's partially your fault that your daughter was killed. My fault? Say it! If you continue following Kamiki, you're the one who's going to be in trouble. What a joke. If he manages to kill me, he'll get the death penalty. You really want that to happen? Mr. Katayama, are you returning to challenge Kamiki? No, that's not my intention. I don't care. You cannot appear in front of Kamiki again. If you do, I'll have to take you in. I'm really sorry about it. Don't worry about it. That man cannot interfere with your life. If he ever shows himself in front of you, we'll have the police come in. We will protect you. I won't let him lay a finger on you. Well, we have to get back to work. I'm cooperating with the guardian to watch Katayama's movement. I don't want to be bothered by this. I'll get the police hassle him with any small problem. Sudou Dry Cleaning... It's been a while. Kamiki? You met Katayama, right? I didn't tell him anything. I know. You're not that stupid. Besides, you got yourself a cute daughter. Hey, Kunio. You can get anything over the internet. That guy's really something. What flavor is it? What's wrong? You're drinking alcohol during the day. Shut up. Did something happen? Did Kamiki call you? If you try to meet Kamiki, you'll return to your old self. You'll be betraying Natsumi and me. Besides, you promised your probation officer. I won't forgive you if you try to betray us. "If you kill someone when you're 13, by law you cannot be punished." "13 year olds are protected by law." "It's like having a license to kill." Mr. Katayama, it's me, Sudou. What's wrong? Kamiki contacted me. He wants to see me. What did you say? I was told to invite you too. He wants to talk, just the three of us. If we tell anybody else, he might hurt my daughter. Mr. Katayama, what should I do? I see. Just do as he says. Well, where's the place? I'm keeping an eye on Sudou Dry Cleaning. If Katayama appears, I'll warn him. I know you come from an elite group... but the fact is, you're just an inexperienced social worker. If you don't learn to judge people, you'll be deceived by people like Katayama. Yes, I'm very sorry about the problem that I caused. I'll try my best this time. Kamiki? Kamiki? Why are you... ...here? Try to get as close as possible. If you're in close range, you'll definitely hit your target. I shot three times. Takeshi, did you really kill someone? Yeah. I can't believe you actually killed someone. You've crossed the line. Bang! If you tell anybody, I'll kill you too. What is it? The gun that was used in Sudou's murder was stolen from the US Military. What? It was sold on the internet to a person named Katayama Toshiki yesterday. What did you say? It was sold with 200 bullets. 200? First thing's first, can you come to the station now? Give me a break. If you investigate, you'll find who really bought that gun. Mr. Katayama! I see. Mr. Katayama! I'm borrowing your car. Mr. Katayama, don't do this! Let the police handle this! Mr. Katayama! My brother? We put an APB out on him for attacking an officer. If he tries to contact you, please let me know. I'm so sorry. Here's our chance. Assaulting a police officer... Hurry up and catch him. And then you'll be his lawyer? That's an interesting thought. Kamiki's missing? We lost him when we weren't paying attention for just a minute or so. He ran away. He was afraid Katayama would kill him. We'll arrest Katayama as soon as we find him. If you hear anything, give us a call. Excuse me. Are you sure? My husband said so. Three years ago, Kamiki murdered Kihara. Kihara had enough of his plans to get even with Katayama. So Kamiki pushed Kihara and he fell down from the crossing bridge. Kamiki was afraid my husband would say something to the police. He told my husband if he ever mentioned this to the police... Kamiki would kill our daughter. It was Kamiki. Please avenge his death. Please... I'm just a volunteer here. Katayama! Don't throw away your life. I'm saying this for Ayano's sake too. If you get killed, it's everyone's loss. Bang! Bang! Is someone there? Is someone there? I know there's somebody out there. Where the hell is Kamiki? You mentioned "a man" to me before. It was Kamiki, wasn't it? Where the hell is he? Where!? Mommy... Mommy, it hurts... "Kill this asshole." Who the fuck is this guy? Who cares? If he tells us to do it, we do it. Hello. Mr. Katayama... It's me, Takezawa. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I'm with Kamiki now. Kamiki? You want to kill me, don't you, Mr. Katayama? Is that you, Kamiki? This has nothing to do with her. Let her go. Can't do that. She's my hostage. Where are you now? Tell me where are you! Do you have an accomplice? Who killed Sudou? I have no idea. In this town, people kill each other all the time. Like I once did. Last night, I dreamt about that little girl. She told me that her mommy had gone to hell. Then I told her that her father would soon join her. So she thanked me. You're sick. Really? I think I'm normal. Kamiki! Where the hell are you? Where are you!? - This is fun. - Awesome! I'm sorry! So sorry! Where the hell is Kamiki? I don't know. Stop pretending you don't know! I really don't know. I've never even seen him before. What? No one's ever met him before. What did you say? I'm not lying! Hurts so bad! Oh, you missed. You really are unlucky, aren't you, Mr. Katayama. Mr. Katayama? Where are you now? I have a favor to ask. Please take care... ...of my sister Kaori.
