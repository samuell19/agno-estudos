Everybody says, Yaji-san and Kita-san or Yaji and Kita. Can't Just one of them call us Kita and Yaji! No way. I don't believe you. It's not my reality. Boring. Reality is boring. Poor baby. Without realizing he was dead he kept traveling with you. He loved you so much. Yaji-san. Forgive me. Wanna see him? Yes. I want to. Then trick yourself. Convince yourself he's alive. Then you'll see him. For a junkie like you, it'll be easy, right? Take the drugs and you'll ruin everything. Yaji-san... Hey, that's deep. Really deep. You can't come over here. Why not? You're dead. You died. Stop messing with me. Who are you anyway? Datsueba: the clothes thief demon. Datsueba? You got killed by Kita. You lie. Kita-san would never do that. This is the famous River Styx. Go over there and rest in peace. Don't cry. I can't rest in peace. I can't. I promised. I promised Kita-san we'd go to lse. I want to travel more and more with him. You can't cheat death. That's the rule. Death? Kita-san! Hey Kita-san! Kita-san! Over here! Forgive me Yaji-san. Forgive me. Kita-san. Kita-san. Yaji-san, traveling alone is too painful. Yaji's alive, alive, alive.

Get high. Get high. Yaji-san would never say that. Sorry. I'm not really Yaji. Then who are you? Four-ji. Bloody fool. Are you awake? What'll you have? Yaji-san. Yajisan, Yajisan, Yajisan... Sorry, we don't serve that drink. Not a drink. He's my lover I killed. A rendezvous? Rendezvous? Oh, yeah. I'm waiting for someone. I won't move until he comes. Oh, Kita. Kitahachi. Kita Kita. Kita Honey. Kita Baby. Wanna ride? A ride? Where to? The source of the River Styx. The source? You don't want to cross, you can't go back. So how about going up? Check the map? Look here. The river divides life and death, right? So if we go to the source, life and death might be connected. Uh-huh. Whatever you say. You're smart, Datsueba of the River Styx. A regular Saibaba. Wait for me, Kita-san! Between night and morning Between men and women How beautiful. Between men and women Between reality and dreams Between this world and that world There are various "betweens" but... For your dead lover... There are various "betweens" but... Or between me and you A butterfly cocktail. Or between me and you Or between me and you Or between me and you Damn it. All is darkness All is dark Yaji and Kita, the Midnight Pilgrims Shit. Walk? It's dark. And scary. Dark and scary. Scary and dark. Scary. Scary. Dark. Dark. What's that? Nirvana Harbor. Otherwise called Nirvana Un-healthy Spa. SOUL'S INN WELCOME You don't see that everyday. How many kids are in their family? They're not people. They're souls like you. Souls, huh? The same as me? Souls separated from their flesh. They cross the River Styx... And vanish in the darkness. Cheers! Before that they have fun one last time. I did it my way. Here's your chicken. I didn't order. But... Ew! You'll be like them soon. I'll go look for the source. Don't move a muscle. I won't. Darn. I lost weight again. Rule Violation! 30 grams? Bless my soul. Yaji-san? Yeah. Who are you? Can't you tell? No. You all look the same to me. That makes me sad. No way. Mind blowing.

Yeah, I can see my dead lover. Kita-san. Are you Yaji-san? No, I'm a fake Yaji-san. You're dreaming of your lover. Fine with me. Give the fake Yaji-san whatever I'm drinking. And some pretzels and chocolates. Chocolates and then some... Sir. Listen carefully. Bringing back your lover takes great concentration. If you lose focus over chocolates, he'll disappear. Now concentrate. Think only about your lover. Yaji-san. Yaji-san. Yaji-san. Yaji-san. Screw you! Hey, Yaji-san! Screw you! Yaji-san! Screw you! Yaji-san? Screw you. Yaji-san. Screw you! Yaji-san. I made the fake Yaji come to life by concentrating. That you did. I'll have that drink now! Bartender! Gimme a round of-- What's with you? Actually, I died a while back. So somebody must be thinking about you, huh? My wife. Magic mushrooms. Is she asleep? Mayumi, Mayumi, you okay? Pick up some tofu and eggs on your way home. Who's he? A customer. I don't wanna. Even after I died, she kept believing I was alive. Thanks to her thoughts, I can run my bar. She's half mushroom but she dreams about me. So, you should keep giving your lover cocktails. He fell asleep. He's zonked. This way. This way. Hold on a sec. Hmm... Oh, that way. This way, sir. Hey, Non-no? Some Tokaido Highway. Uh-huh. If you say, "How careless of me" I'm gonna be pissed. Stuff it and walk, you faggot. What'd you say? How careless of me. Huh? How careless of me! Non-no. Non-no. Don't do that. Don't throw my manly throne. You sure? What about this expensive book? Non-no? I told you "don't move". This is my pleasure team. Who goes there? Poor girls. They died because of me. Hey Datsueba. Can they come back to life like me? Idiot! The walls have ears. Back to life? Back to life? Back to life? Bath towel? Whyever? Let's go. I don't want to disappear. Hey Datsueba. I don't want to disappear. Forgive me! Why do you get to come back to life? Run. Say something. No thanks. Magic trick? No thanks. Hit me again. Who are you thinking about? Why Kita, of course. Yajirobe, Kitahachi! You're under arrest for killing Ohatsu and suspicion of other stuff. Police business. Louder. Police business! Louder. Yeah, official biz! Ohatsu? Who's she? My wife I left back in Edo. Non-no? Yes sir. Yajirobe and Kitahachi, our warrant says... What's that say? It says "wife". You killed the wife Ohatsu, and ran away. Be careful. Remember...you're his dream. I understand. Think only of Kita. You told him, lnspector. Back off! Kita-san. Kita-san...Darn it. I can't get Ohatsu off my mind. Honey! Ohatsu. What's she doing alive? What the-- The source of the River Styx. So you're the source, huh? No wonder I can't get past. Do you recognize me? Of course. A man never forgets his wife's face, no matter how she changes. For real? You're my wife. Honey. Long time, no see. It's been a while. Is this maggot your lover? He is. Spiteful turd. Mushroom face husband stealer. Stop. Back off! Stop. Stop it. We're both part of his dream. If he dies, we vanish too. Who cares! Besides, you died long ago. He's half mushroom. He won't die if you cut him. Behold the legendary sword that severs DNA, Excalibur. I'm totally lost. This is the big scene. I know. I know. Ohatsu. Honey. Choose. If she stops crying, the border between life and death will dry up. But, if she keeps crying, you can't cross over. I see. I'll create a diversion and you run over. Impossible. Why? Well... ...she's too big. Besides, it's my fault she's crying. What are you doing? It's midnight. Washing rice. Why don't you wash it tomorrow morning? Morning's too late. I have to do it now. Women... can't live with them. Can't shoot them. Will you stop it! I have to wash the rice. Why now? I always do it at night. You were either staying out until morning or asleep. You never noticed. But this way makes the rice taste good. You lie. Here's your rice. Ohatsu. I'm washing rice. I'm in love with a man. But I'll always love you. But I fell in love. Sorry, Ohatsu. Forgive me, but I'm-- What? I'll make miso soup. Stop it. Stop. Let go. You let go. Let go. No. No! No! No! No! No! Stop. Stop it, Ohatsu. Stop. What? Don't leave me. I never said I would. I can't live without you. Oh! Yeah. Me too. Me too. Really? Really. Really? Really. I saw your life vanish right in front of me. I couldn't do anything except watch. It was scary. Shameful. I cried and cried. So I hit the road. To stop being serious and live wildly and die wildly. But I got too wild, and Kita killed me. Serves me right. You're selfish. I'm selfish... You're a coward. ...and a coward. Ohatsu. Do you hate me? Do you hate Kita? How could I possibly? On the contrary, I want to keep traveling with him. Telling you this is strange but l want to keep traveling with Kita-san. Forgive me. Then I don't hate you. Don't wake up. Ohatsu. Honey. Kita-san. What, fake Yaji-san? It was fun while it lasted. Sir. Outta the way. She stopped. We can leap frog to life! Go for it. Yeah! Damn! What the heck? Take the shortcut. I have to cross your butt? Hurry. I still have lots of crying to do. Datsueba. Don't ass me. Phew! Stinky! Raunchy! That stinks! Phew! Shit, for a soul, how could you fart on me? Phew. Stinky. Ohatsu. What's wrong? You got old. I was just imagining my death. That's a bad omen. You're older too. Really? I was dreaming. Enough to last an entire lifetime. At last I can't make heads or tails of dreams or reality. Drink up. No, I'm done dreaming. I'll die someday and have to go to the other side. But you know, death with Yaji wouldn't be so bad. Sir, sir. Your friend is here. Yaji-san. Oh, Kita, long time, no see. How've you been? Where were you? I was... A lot happened after you killed me. But I'm fine now. We can travel together again. You're a mess. Yeah. I fell down. You stink. I fell. I fell in a cesspool. And got bit by a dog. Yeah, it hurts. Why the snake? Thought I'd eat it. Bloody fool. Screw you. Screw you. Bloody fool! Screw you! Bloody fool! It really is you. It really is you. Kita-san. Yaji-san. Kita-san. Gimme that hair bun. Hug me tighter, tighter. You sure you want me? Ouch. Does it hurt? Ouch. Does it hurt? Ouch. It hurts. Yaji-san, you're my only reality. Screw you. Bloody fool. Don't eat me. That's how much I love you. Does it bother you? It doesn't bother me, but those are magic mushrooms. What the hell! What the hell! Hey lnspector. Whatcha thinkin' about? Elephants. Elephants? Everybody in Edo knows about elephants from the land of barbarians. Oh, elephants, eh? Yaji-san? Yeah, Kita-san? Are we there yet? We're close. We'll make the Oi River soon. You sure? Don't know. Don't know at all. You're no help. Who cares. I don't know where we're going or what we're riding. You know, right? Of course. Elephants, right? Their fins are tasty. Do you really know? You pest! Non-no! Elephants, right? Big ears, long nose. With a place for your hands. Wheels in front an back. And it goes Vroom, vroom, vroom. That's a motorcycle! Screw you! Bloody fool! Shichinosuke Nakamura Tomoya Nagase From Edo to new York Thousands of lights lead the way A journey to find yourself?
