(David grunts) (hand weight thuds) (Adrianne cries out) (disjointed ominous music) (gun firing) - Diane's beautiful eyes have always played the strings of my heart effortlessly. I couldn't imagine life without her. Not for a second did I wanna lose her. I was totally in love with her and always will be. (bell rings) - Guys, most really suck. You are so lucky to have David even though he does go to Manning. - Oh, I know. - Ooh, although Billy's pretty cute, don't you think? - I haven't noticed. - Oh, come on. - No, I mean, it's just you know, David and me are really special. - Yeah, but I mean just hypothetically speaking. Let's suppose David never knew. - There is no suppose. I mean, David and me, it's not just because we're getting married and we're gonna be together forever. It's like we're the same person in a way and always have been. It's kind of hard to put into words. (chuckles) - Yeah, but I at least wish I had a relationship I could put into words. - Oh, you will. If you want something bad enough, things just come to you. I mean, that's been my experience. - I want Billy. - I think you should aim higher. - (chuckles) It's easy for you to say. You have David. - Yeah, David's special, it's true. He'd do anything in the world for me. (Susie chuckles) (drumsticks tapping rhythmically) - At close interval. Dress right, dress! - [Announcer] And now if y'all would rise for the presentation of the colors by the members of the Manning High ROTC. - Ready! Front! Color Guard, fall in! Quickstep, halt.

Aw, come on. - [David] Even though we went to different schools, Diane and I created and lived in our own separate, wonderful world. (crowd chattering) - That was embarrassing. - How'd we look? - You looked magnificent. Greenish brown female sheep. - Greenish brown female sheep. That was our secret code (sultry music) so we could say any time, anywhere how much we loved each other and no one else would ever know. - David, wait. I don't wanna do anything until, you know, David. Don't be mad. - I'm not mad, I just don't understand what we're waiting for here. Do you doubt me? - I don't doubt you. - So what are you (mumbles)? - David. - What? What, do you think if we make love this is gonna change things or something? That only makes me think you don't believe in us. - No, I do. - Okay. - It's just that, David, my virginity's something I can only give you once. - I know.

You don't know her. - The girl from the fried chicken place. So, how did it happen? I mean, don't make me drag it out of you. - It just happened. I mean, I was at the track meat and we were talking, and then, I don't know, we sat on the bus together. I was talkin' to her and then she kissed me and... - Go on. - I don't know. She needed a ride home so I said I'd give her a ride, and we didn't go straight there, we stopped at the school first. - What did you do? - I had carnal knowledge of her.

(sobbing) - [David] For at least an hour she screamed sobs I wouldn't have thought possible. (Diane sobbing) It wasn't just jealousy. For Diane - Why? - she'd been betrayed, deceived, and forgotten. (Diane sobbing) - I don't think it was your fault. Women have ways of makin' a man forget himself. She knew what she was doin'. So therefore she must suffer the consequences. - Whatever you say. - It's the only way. And when she's gone, we can go on as before, but not until. You understand? - Yeah. - She'll have to suffer the consequences. She will have to die.

I wonder what she was doing out here with no shoes. Hey. Hey, you. Here, son, step back behind this tape, come on. - Is that blood? Is that her blood? - Yeah. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, watch where you're walkin'. What's your name, son? - Larry. I'm a friend of A.J.'s, I mean, if it is A.J. - [Tom] A.J.? - Adrianne Jones, everybody calls her A.J. at school. Is it her? - Come on, son, we need to ask you some, right this way, come on. Ask you some questions, over here. - Hi, this is Linda Jones, Adrianne Jones' mother. I called before. Yeah, hi. Yes, I called missing persons and I've called all around and I can't find her anywhere. Well when? I'm getting a, okay, I'll hold. Did you find her? - Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, Ms. Jones, your daughter's dead. (Linda breathing raggedly) Ma'am, the reason we have to do this now is that, actually this is a homicide investigation. - What does that mean? - Your daughter's death wasn't an accident, Ms. Jones. She was shot. - Not an accident, you mean-- - We need to find out who did this so we have to-- - You mean my Adrianne was shot? - Yes, ma'am. And in a case like this it's important that we act quickly, so. - You mean deliberately murdered? - Yes, ma'am. - Oh God, (sobbing) oh my God. Oh my God! (sobbing) - Do you know where your daughter was last night, who she was with? - Um, she was, um... No one, she went to her job and then she and I went to work out together. (sobbing) Oh God, are you sure? (sobbing) - What time was that, ma'am? - She was ironing her school clothes at around 11, I saw her. - And you didn't see her go out again? - Where was she? (crying) - Did she talk to anybody? Were there any phone calls? - Phone calls. Um, yeah, yeah. Her boyfriend, Tracy Smith, he called her. And we let her talk to him even though it was after 10. There was somebody else, David, or, I don't know, I don't remember. The track team or soemthin', I don't remember. - But she didn't go out? - It was a school night. But this morning, sometimes she gets up and goes running in the morning, and so when she didn't come to breakfast I thought maybe she went to school early, but her books were here, and her shoes. She has two pair of tennis shoes and one of 'em was missing. And so I thought she was out running. Then I found 'em in the dryer. I used to always worry about her gettin' hit by a car runnin' in the dark like she did. Oh God, somebody killed my little girl. (sobbing) Somebody killed my little girl. (sobbing) - [Jason] Is Adrianne dead? - You're Jason, aren't ya? Your mother's gonna need you to help her through this, Jason. - I will. I saw a pickup truck in the night. - You did? When was this? - Last night about midnight. - [Tom] Uh-huh. - I couldn't sleep so then I looked out my window and I saw a white pickup truck pullin' away. - You sure? - I think so. - [Principal] I'd like to have your attention for a moment, please. I have an announcement. We have lost a student. It is my sad task to inform you that 10th grader Adrianne Jones is dead. - [Student] Whoa. - [Principal] This is a tragedy we will all have to deal with in our own way, but she was one of Manning's own, and we are all saddened by her loss. I know how all of you would like-- - [Boy] Hey, Tommy. - [Principal] There will be a police inquiry into her movements up to the time of her death and anyone who can offer any help is encouraged to come forward. Again, this is a shock for all of us and a time of sadness and reflection. (students chattering) - I'm sorry, David. Look, did you talk to A.J. last night? - Did I talk to Adrianne? No, why would I? - Because someone said she talked to a David from the track team and you were the only one Coach Barr could think of. - Wasn't me. - Yeah, okay, I'm sorry to bother you. It's just, this is so terrible and they're gonna be talking to everyone who knew her. - That's okay, no problem. That first day at school was the hardest, to make it seem as though nothing had happened when we were really both scared as hell. - [Woman On Loudspeaker] 5th period biology students may now report - Well, you are - to the school cafeteria. - on the track team and your name is David. - Yes, sir. - 5th period biology students - But you were - can report - dating her, right? - to the school cafeteria. - We weren't going steady or anything, but. - Okay, now, you called her on Sunday night and while you were talking to her somebody called in, right? - [Tracy] Mm-hm. - You drive a pickup? - No, sir. Did the killer drive a pickup? - [Carl] You know anyone who drives a white pickup? - No, sir. - [Tom] Any idea who that was? - She said it was some guy named Bryan. - You sure it was Bryan? - Bryan's what she told me. - And you say you never dated Adrianne? - No, sir, I'm engaged to be married. - Little young to get married, aren't ya? - No, sir, we already set the date. Right after I graduate from the Air Force Academy. - [Tracy] Bryan's what she told me. - Hopefully. - [Tom] Not David? - [Tracy] No, sir. A friend of hers who was really upset. That's all I know. - Well, good luck. You think of anything that might help us, give us a call. - Yes, sir. - She told me I didn't know him, so I didn't really pay it much mind. She put me on hold while she talked to him. I didn't think she'd sneak out to meet that guy or anything. - [Tom] Mm-hm. - But she wouldn't have told me that exactly, would she have? - Tom, there's a Bryan McMillen in her address book. - Thank you. (frenetic heavy metal music) ♪ This is again ♪ (engine rumbling) - Bryan McMillen? I'm Detective Baker from Tanner Police. This is Detective Green from Manning. We're workin' on a case. We were hopin' you might be able to help us out. - Me? Is this about Adrianne Jones? - You don't mind answering some questions, do you, Bryan? - No, why not? - Of course we could check with the phone company, but it would help us out if you remember. - Well, see the only thing is I don't remember. - Bryan, you either called her Sunday night or you didn't. - Well, see I was drinkin' some, and when you mix that with the other pills I take sometimes the next day it's like I wasn't even there, ya know? - What kind of pills are you takin', Bryan? - Well, a couple of things, for depression and all. - Did you go over there, Bryan? Is it possible that you called her and then maybe drove by there? Even though you were drinking, is that possible? - It's possible. I mean, I don't remember much. - He don't remember much. It's all on tape and I offered him a lawyer. - We don't even know if he's tracking. The kid's on medication for God's sake. - Now why were ya drinkin', then? - I was just, ya know. - I know, I know. It's the end of the weekend, you've got school tomorrow. - Might as well get drunk, bash some girl's head in with a hammer. - [Bryan] I'd never hurt A.J. - Nah, you wouldn't do that. You're not that kind of a guy. But if he is, he doesn't remember. - It's not my fault I don't remember, is it? Look, ask anybody. - Who? Make us a list, Bryan. You write the names of everybody who called Adrianne on Sunday night because they were really, really upset and depressed and had to see her. - [Officer] Bryan, you're the only one on that list there. - But even if I went there I wouldn't have killed her. - But you don't remember, right? So how do ya know? - All right, Bryan, had you done it, just supposing, all right, Bryan? Where would ya leave the body? What kind of place? - I don't know. Away from people, somewhere remote, a field. Away from houses. (singing in foreign language) - I feel so strange. - Shock is what it is. It's gonna be all right. - I don't know. - Come on, Diane, we're in the clear. They got that Bryan McMillen kid. - But he didn't do it. - Don't worry about that. If they can't prove he did it, they gotta let him go. - That's what I mean. They're gonna know the real killer's still out there and they're never ever gonna stop looking, never. - Look, I know on TV they always get the guy in the end, but in real life there's a lot of cases where they never figure out what happened. - (sighs) Maybe. Just need for some time to pass. - I know, I know. - God, David. - You just gotta hang in there, okay? - We've been very lucky so far, but right now we need to tow the line. - You're right and we will. - Beautiful service. - We have to become models of good conduct from here on out. - Hi.

(guests cheer) (guests applaud) I can't believe it, I'm accepted at Annapolis. I'm in the class of the year 2000. Can you stand it? - We're all so proud of you. - Oh. - And David, too. - Oh, David, David, by the way, David got into West Point and the Air Force Academy. (guests cheer) (guests applaud) - [Carl] Okay, Bryan, you can see how this is going. We need to find out everything there is to know about you and Adrianne. - We were just friends. I never hit anybody in my life, not on purpose, never mind bashin' their head in with a hammer. - How did you know her head was bashed in, Bryan? - What? - You said her head was bashed in with a hammer. How'd you know that? - Somebody said it. - Nope, try again. - It was on the news then. - No, that was never released to the media. That little detail is something very few people know about. - But you knew. Where's the hammer, Bryan. - I didn't, somebody musta said it then, because I didn't kill her! - All right, that's enough of this. Let's go, Bryan. - Oh, hey, hey! - Hey, wait. - You gonna charge him? Don't tell me what I can do when it comes to my son. - [Carl] Now, Mr. McMillen, I really think we oughta talk about this. - Now, I already told your boss I may not be rich or a big shot, but you mess with my son and I'll come after you or anybody else with everything I got, cop or no cop, you hear me? (crickets chirping) - Clear. - Clear. (whistle blowing) (upbeat marching band music) - [Officer] Clear. Police Department, we have a search warrant. Police Department! Put your hands in the air. (woman screams) Do it now. - [Officer] Put your hands in the air. - [Officer] Police Department. Bryan McMillen, you're under arrest. - [Officer] Get out of bed, get out of bed. - Can I put on my pants? - Get up, come on. - This is a very rare and distinctive honor which brings credit not only to himself, (Jimmy cries out) but to his family - Let go of me! - and to Manning High as well. And so, I present to you our very own David Graham. - Thank you. (crowd cheers) - Hands up. - What's goin' on? - [Officer] Get on the ground, get on the ground. (crowd cheering) - [Officer] Handcuff him. (crowd applauding) - I'll never stop loving you, Diane. - You better not, not with what I've got on you. - [Officer] You're under arrest for the murder of Adrianne Jones. (crowd cheering) (crowd applauding) (upbeat marching band music) - [Officer] Get him up, come on. (crowd cheering) (camera clicks) - What happened that night, A.J.? - [Val] I hear they're gonna hook Bryan McMillen up to a lie detector. - Yeah, like Forrest Gump mighta been the killer. - Now that's not kind, Larry. - Well it's true. Bryan's not exactly arch criminal material. - Yeah, everybody but the police knows that. - Yeah, they know it, too, only now they're gonna have to do somethin' about it after they let old Bryan go. - Yeah, it'll be real again, ya know? - Yeah, she was a real girl and now she's really gone. - I still can't believe it. I mean, she's dead. She died right here. - [Interviewer] Are you a student at Manning High School? - [Bryan] Yeah. - [Interviewer] Do you know anyone that owns a white pickup truck? - Yeah, no. - Were you born in 1972? - [Bryan] No. - Bryan. - Let's get this straight. Bryan is not a suspect in this case - Do you have any comments - any longer. - about your recent situation? - [Man] Move over here, please. - Bryan, Bryan! - He was not released for lack of evidence. - What was your relationship with Adrianne, Bryan? - He was set free because he - Mr. McMillen, what have-- - was arrested in error. - Bryan look this way, please. - Sir. - Can we find out, Bryan. - [Reporter] Can we get a statement, please? - His lawyer'll have somethin' for ya later on, but just give the kid a break, all right? - [Reporter] Mr. McMillen, one more question, please? - Mr. McMillen. - Sir, please. (somber music) - What can one say about a life ended so soon? She was here with us and then she was gone. It must be enough that we celebrate her life, accepting her in memory, and trusting in our Lord Jesus Christ to keep her in the hollow of his hand. Larry. (ominous music) - [Carl] Tom, where are those files? - Back here. - [Carl] Good. - Finnegan begin again. - Well she knew him, so the killer's gotta be in one of these folders here. - We'll find him eventually. Probably. - Yeah. (chuckles) There's one, Grady, first name Pete. Let's see, he was in County General that night with bad tonsils. - Now that's an alibi. - Un-huh. Graham, first name David. - Yeah, I remember him. He was on the high school track team. - Yeah, that's him, interviewed him myself. - [Tom] Graham, yeah he was going to Annapolis or-- - No, that was his girlfriend. This young man is goin' to Colorado Springs. - Air Force Academy? Outstanding. - Yeah, outstanding is right, he's a good kid. Read this. National Merit Finalist, athlete, ROTC battalion commander. That young man is a recruiting poster. - [Tom] Doesn't drive a pickup. - No pick 'em up truck. Ralph Buyers. - I'm going home because I actually have a life. - [Carl] Hey Tom, we got about 50 or 60 more here. - [Tom] They'll all be there Monday morning, Carl. - Thanks for your help, Tom.

Something else. - Enjoy your evening. - Yeah, have a nice time. - Okay, so here are the two latest. Adrianne snuck out of the house and went to this rave party where she wound up with some gang members. Oh, and Jenny Taylor? She heard that it was Colombians. She knew too much. But this is the one that you're gonna die over. You killed her with a baseball bat. - Really? - I mean, I couldn't believe Morgan Manlee would actually say something like that, but you were the one who told me she didn't like you, so. - Morgan Manlee said that? Who was she talking to? - I don't know, she was talking to some girl, but what she said was that David was unfaithful to you. You know, with her. - She's so full of it. Like David would ever be unfaithful to me. - Yeah, but I mean, to go and kill somebody over it? - On top of which she was shot, or did Morgan forget that little detail? - Well yeah, but I mean her head was, anyway, you have to be some kind of lunatic to do something like that. - Well she wasn't saying that she saw anything. I mean, she wasn't talking about somebody eyewitnessing anything, was she? - No, it wasn't like that. - All right then, she should keep her stupid mouth shut. - Okay. (girls chattering) - I'm tellin' ya. - Yeah, it's party time. So there's the famous Diane. Well David may think she hung the moon, but I'm not seein' it. - Why, what's the matter with her? - I don't know, she just strikes me as a stuck up, you know what. - You guys are not gonna believe what I just heard. There is a rumor goin' around that David Graham's girlfriend killed A.J. - What? - You heard this in the girl's room? - I overheard her talking to someone, her name is Diane something. - Zamora, we know. So give. What'd she say? - Well, they said that David slept with A.J. and Diane found out about it and killed her with a baseball bat. - What? - Yeah, good, right. I think that was right after they both got abducted by space aliens. (Val laughs) - I still think it was Marguerite if it was another girl. After what she did to Lucy, A.J. testifying against her and all. - Yeah, but the police have already been down that road, haven't they? - [Perry] Who knows? ♪ Say goodbye ♪ - What? - It's okay, it'll go away. - She said you did it with a baseball bat?

What's done is done, isn't that right? - [Student] Okay. - Yes, that's right. - Okay, all right then. No matter what we do or say, nothing can bring her back, so the only thing left for us is we have to live up to our potential. - You're right. We have to have the character to make it through the bad to get to the good in life. - [Student] Is king! (girl laughs) - Okay. - Come dance with me.

Hello, Ms. Jones. - Hi. - Didn't see you. (chuckles) What can I do for you? - I just came by to talk to somebody, to see what was happenin'. - Well I'm sorry, Ms. Jones. We're still working on it, but the truth is it's a very difficult kind of case. - You mean 'cause it's been so long? - What I mean is when an adult is killed it's easier to trace their movements and contacts and so on, but with a high school girl, she literally came in contact with hundreds of people, so it's a huge investigative job and we're doin' the best-- - So are you makin' any headway? - Ma'am, I'd like to be more optimistic, but the truth is we're not much further along. - Don't stop tryin', okay? - We'll keep trying. We will. - Ya know, I've taken to wearin' somethin' of hers, every day somethin' belonged to her. This was hers. - It's very pretty. - Oh, I still, when the door slams I look up. I know she's not comin' home, but I still... - Yes, ma'am. - Don't stop trying. - Bye, thanks for comin'. - I'll be home in July. - Take care. - Take care of yourself. - All right. You be good now, okay? - I will. I'm gonna miss you so much. - I'll miss you, too. - Greenish brown female sheep. - Me, too. - [Man] Say hi to Nancy for me. - Oh God, please just go, I'm dyin'. - [Woman] Bye. Call when you get there. - Are you okay? - Oh Mama, I just have this terrible feelin'. - It will get better. A few days and then you'll be off on your own adventure. - No, I mean I just have this awful sense that everything is ending. - Nothing is ending. It's all beginning for you, and for David. - I'm so afraid. - It's going to be good for you, you'll see. Even this separation. I know you don't believe me, it's going to do you good to spend a little time apart from each other. - You don't know what you're talkin' about. - Is the world coming to an end again? - No, she's sad to say goodbye but something else, too. - Eh, don't worry. Give her a couple of days in Annapolis and everything will be fine, you watch. (dramatic drum music) - I know you've shown promise or you wouldn't be here, but if any one of you thinks that the honor code does not apply to him or her, then let me save you some heartache. Leave now. Get up and walk away. You won't like it here. And frankly, we don't want you here. - [Officer] Hey, that's roughing. Move, move. - [Commander] That's right, we take the honor code seriously and I tell you this from my own experience. If you have no honor, - [Officer] Let's go, let's go! - [Commander] you have nothing. You will abide by the code while you are at Annapolis. You will abide by the code as long as you wear the uniform. It takes a very special individual to wear the uniform of a naval officer. And if you are such a person, we welcome you. If not, you will surely come to ruin. You can be declared officers by act of Congress, but honor can only come from within. (somber trumpet music) (button clattering) (Diane breathing raggedly) - I just had to tell somebody. If David were here-- - I understand, I guess. - I couldn't live with such a terrible secret anymore, I'm so sorry. - Look, don't worry, Diane. I won't tell anyone. Your secret's safe with me. - [David] Diane's beautiful eyes have always played the strings of my heart effortlessly. I couldn't imagine life without her. Not for a second did I wanna lose her. - Yeah, well, my boyfriend's goin' to Boston University. - [Gail] That's a good school. - Yeah, yeah. He swore he wouldn't date anybody else, but I kinda think he will. Oh, he may feel guilty about it, but he'll go out, I'm sure. - Why do men find it so difficult to be faithful? - [Diane] David won't be cheatin' on me. - Oh sure, why not? Because he said so? - No, because we have a secret that we have to take to the grave. - Come on. I can't think of anything that's bad enough to make a man keep his hands to himself once he's had a couple of beers. There was this once-- - So what is it? What happened? - [Gail] Yeah, what did he do? - [Annette] Yeah, what'd ya do, kill for each other? - Yes. - Get outta here. - He was unfaithful with this girl back home and I wanted her dead so he did it. I saw him do it. - And she died? - [Diane] Oh yeah. He shot her twice, I was there. (somber music) - [Officer] Roll in. Right, left. (soft ominous music) - [Carl] State your name, please. - Diane Zamora. - Okay, Diane, you have been advised of your legal rights, is that correct? Your rights to an attorney and so on? - Yes, sir. - Now, what can you tell us about the murder of Adrianne Jones? - (grunts) Nothing, sir. - [Officer] Right, left, right. - Diane, we came a long way. We know what you told you roommates, your fellow cadets. - Oh, I'm sorry about that, sir, but see, that was just girl talk. I was trying to impress my classmates and I just, I made some stuff up just, well I don't know why. - So your statement now is that what you told them isn't true. - Yes, sir. - Diane, according to your roommates, your boyfriend David shot Adrianne twice. - That's not true. - [Carl] And you have no idea who did. - No, sir. - Diane, if you're hiding something, anything, the only way you can help yourself out is to talk to us. - Sir, I was very foolish to say the things I did, but it wasn't true, none of it. I knew about the Jones girl getting killed and everything so naturally that's what came into my mind, but it was just talk, honest. - It's just for a few days until this business gets cleared up. - He on the field right now? - Yes, sir. - I believe so, yes. - Here are your orders. You go home to Texas and you rest up after plebe summer. Think of it as a furlough. - Yes, sir. - Very well. The duty van'll give you a lift to the airport. That's all, Zamora, dismissed. - Aye aye, sir. - [Officer] You've got about another 18 minutes. (somber music) - What is the first name that Adrianne's mother gave us? David from cross country. - Yeah, but he's not the type. We both said so. - What is the type? - (sighs) We dropped the ball on this. - He's a recruiting poster, so I don't put him on a polygraph. - Let's go do that. - No, first we go back to Manning. There's gotta be somebody that knows somethin' about those two. - [Announcer] At this time, we'd like to Flight 151 to Birmingham non-stop. Please advise our - Hi. - first class passengers, - What can I do for you - platinum circle members, - Midshipman Zamora? - and passengers-- - Well, I have these travel orders. - All right. Looks like that's gonna take you into Dallas-Fort Worth and the next flight is-- - Yeah, I know, I need to make a stop first in Colorado Springs. - [Clerk] Colorado Springs? - [Diane] Mm-hm. - That's Air Force country, isn't it? - Yeah, my fiance's at the academy. - Thought the Air Force and the Navy were big rivals. - Well, I plan to transfer my commission after I graduate. We're both gonna be fliers. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Well, in that case, let's see if we can't find you a plane. - Great. Could you just tell him that Diane will be there as planned, the plane's leavin' on time? And one more thing, just put greenish brown female sheep. That's right. Now he'll know what it means. Okay, thank you very much. - Yeah, but did they believe you? - I don't know, that's not the point. I was very firm about it. - You know what, they're just gonna keep comin' at us from now on. (Diane sighs) - Well, if they had any hard evidence, they would've brought it with them, right? - I don't know, that's what they do. They just keep comin' on and on. (soft ominous music) - [Diane] Look, the important thing is for us to stick together. - Yeah, you're right. - United we stand, that's what you told me. - God, I missed you so much. (camera clicks) - [Photographer] One minute, I'll be right back. - Okay. - The thing that bothers me is that I never thought they'd run out and tell on me without talking to me first. I mean, what kind of honor code is that? - They should have as fellow officers-- - As fellow officers, they had the obligation to confront me with their suspicions first. - That's right, they did. - They're the ones that broke the code, not me. - You're right, they shoulda come to you first. - Just put this behind you. - I didn't know what to do. Nobody's ever asked me about this until now. - What time was it? - I don't even know, I was asleep. - Okay, so you were asleep. What made you wake up? - Well, (knuckles tapping) he knocked on my window. - I need to come in for a minute, all right? - Okay. (Diane gasps) - [Ben] I thought they must've been in a car wreck or something. - Listen to me, you're my best friend, all right? This never happened. We were never here tonight. We never came in that window, understand? - Okay. - Okay, good. - You guys all right? - Listen, don't ask any questions. You are my friend, this never happened. Okay, okay? - I'm not gonna question ya. If you need a place to stay, you got one right here, you know that. (Diane crying) - What happened next? - Well, I let 'em in. David wanted some clothes. - On the left! - If you need a place to stay, you know you got one right here, man, you know that. - We need to borrow some clothes, okay? Oh, I'm gonna be sick. (coughing) Oh God. (camera clicks) - [Photographer] Hang on, one second. - They're gonna come at you with everything they have now. - Don't worry about me. - I'm not worried. You're the most disciplined man I've ever met. God, I love you. - I love you so much. - And I always will no matter what. - [Tom] What happened to the other clothes, the ones they took off? - I don't know. I don't know. They took 'em with 'em I guess. I looked in on 'em at one point because I heard 'em, like, crying. I left 'em alone and then when I went back later they were gone. And I did talk to David a couple days later and he said that I shouldn't say anything to anybody ever and he wouldn't tell me what happened, so. I don't know. (camera clicks) - We'll get through this, won't we? - Of course we will and we'll be together forever. - Forever and ever. - That's nice. (camera clicks) (ominous music) - You said that before, but you were the only David on the cross country team, weren't ya? - Sir, I never said I didn't know A.J., but I didn't kill her. - Says he didn't kill her. - Mm-hm. Personally, I believe you, David. Why don't you let us give you a polygraph, we can wrap this whole thing up. - Polygraph? - You don't have to, but it would help us out. We can eliminate you as a suspect, move on, focus on the next name on the list, ya know? - I don't know. - Does the Air Force have any objection to a polygraph? - No, no objections. Graham? - Sir, I have no objections. - Good, that's good. - [Interviewer] Were you having a relationship with Adrianna Jones? - [David] No. - [Interviewer] Did you kill Adrianna Jones? - No. - David, I want you to listen to me. We know you did it, the machine told us that. - What? What do you mean? What did it say? - We know you killed Adrianne. - It's not just the polygraph. We talked to your friend Ben about that night. He gave you up. - He told us about the knock on the window, the bloody clothes, you getting sick, you and Diane lying down together and crying. He told us everything, David. - [Tom] We know it was you. - It's your duty to tell the truth, David. It's a matter of honor. - I, I did it. - That's better. Just start with that. Make a chronology. Tell us what happened when, in what order. You're gonna feel a lot better when this is over, believe me. - If ya have a typewriter it'll make things move faster for both of us. - Okay, I'll get ya what you need. (computer keys clicking) - Diane's beautiful eyes have always played the strings of my heart effortlessly. I couldn't imagine life without her. Not for a second did I wanna lose her. I thought long and hard about how to carry out the crime. I was stupid, but I was in love. Some of the plan worked, some did not. The plan was to call Adrianne and convince her to come out to my car. That worked. A.J. it's me, David Graham. Hey, look, I have to talk to you. Can I see you? Can you get outta your house for a few minutes later on tonight? Please, A.J., this is real important, all right? Who was that? So look, can you come tonight? Midnight. Please, A.J., this is real important to me, all right? I'm all twisted up inside and I don't know what to do and you're the only one who can help me, all right. So you'll be there? Great. Okay. (soft suspenseful music) The plan was to drive her out near Joe Pool Lake. That worked. - [Adrianne] So where are we goin'? - Just up the road a piece. I figured we should be alone. - I can't go far, though. - No, no. - My folks caught me sneakin' out one time before and they fixed the screen so I couldn't get back in. - Yeah? - Yeah, my daddy nailed my bedroom window shut so I couldn't sneak out. So what's goin' on with you? - The plan was to, (computer keys clicking) this is not easy for me to confess, break her young neck and sink her to the bottom of the lake with the weights that ended up being hit into her head. That didn't work. (soft ominous music) - So what is it? - Come here. - What? - Just come here. (Adrianne cries out) Come here. - [Adrianne] What are you doing? - Stop! - Let go of me. - Stop. - What are you doing? Let go! What is wrong with you? Let go of me. - Diane, help me hold her. - Oh my God. - Diane, help me. (Adrianne cries out) You hold her. - [Adrianne] What are you doing? - [David] Get her! (Adrianne screaming) - [Adrianne] Get away now! - [David] Come on. I can't get her neck. We realized that it was either her or us. Diane struck her in the back of the head with one of the weights while I held her. - Remember. (skull crunching) (David grunts) (Adrianne whimpers) - [Adrianne] Get off me. (crying) Oh my God. (whimpering) - [David] Come on, hold her. - Come on. - Let me go. Help me. Let me go. Let me go. (whimpering) - (grunting) You didn't die. Never mind. (Adrianne whimpering) (David grunting) Adrianne somehow crawled through the window, and to our horror, ran off. She ran into a nearby field and collapsed. I wanted to just jump in and drive off. We were both shaking and even surprised by the nature of our actions. Neither Diane or myself were ever violent people. (Adrianne grunting) I was panicky and just grabbed the nine miller Makarov to follow. In that short instant I knew I wouldn't leave the key witness to our crime alive. It was either her or us. So I just pointed and shot. (gun fires) I fired again and ran to the car. (gun fires) I was very confused and scared. - [Diane] I love you. - I love you. - Oh David, we shouldn't have done that. - [David] I thought, nice time to tell me. (chuckles) I just wanted it to be a dream. I wanted to be able to drive Adrianne back home, go to sleep, and wake up back on December 3rd, free to make my decisions all over again. Diane was constantly depressed from the guilt. She was also scared I'd be arrested. Really didn't matter, however, what any police or detectives found. What happened was over. Adrianne was gone and I was responsible. And it wasn't going away. (computer beeps) (printer clacking) - Where's the gun, David? - My house. I wrapped it in a shirt and I hid it there. - Need you to sign this. I'll get moving on a warrant. - [Carl] Okay, David, we're goin' nextdoor so let's put these on. - Those are for me? - Yes, they are. (handcuffs clicking) Ya did kill a girl, ya know. - They're bringing your boyfriend down from Colorado. He'll be on a different floor, but I could probably get a message to him. Anything you want me to tell him? - Just tell him greenish brown female sheep. - What's that all about? - It's our code. Greenish brown is olive and female sheep is a ewe. Olive ewe. - [Guard] Olive ewe? - I love you. (reporters shouting) (siren beeping) - [Officer] Come on, ma'am. (officers chattering) - [Officer] Stay back. - [Officer] Back it up, back it up. (reporters and officers chattering) - No questions, please, there'll be official statement later day. - Yes, sir. - David, David! - Later. - David! - [Reporter] Hey, David. David, is there anything you'd like to say to Diane? - I love you. - Back up. Back it up. Sir, back up. - Made you crack?
