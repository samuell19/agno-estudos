One more week until it's just the two of us, finally alone, on our honeymoon. Karl? Karl? Speaking of not being alone. I know. Go help your mother with dinner. I'll clean up here. All right. I love you Nicole, and I cannot wait to make you my wife. Okay, one more week. Karl? Karl? Help me, Karl! Karl, help me! Karl! Karl, help me! Karl! Karl, help me! Help me! And Claudette from the Nexus office just ordered five more two-a-day deliveries. She says we're the most popular people in the office. At this rate, I'm going to have to cancel the vacation with Karl that I haven't even had time to plan yet. When Dad was alive, what did he always teach us? To remarry somebody 25 years younger? Besides that. "Work harder than the next guy and good things are destined to happen." Speaking of working hard, how are those interviews coming? I could really use some help out there with these deliveries. We'll know by next week, and don't worry. - I've got tonight. - Oh, no. You've got plans, big ones. I just ran into Karl parking on the street. He's taking you to see the house again. Really? It must be back on the market. The one on Forrest Drive? Your dream house? Looks like things are getting pretty serious. Oh, come on, we're just looking... But he is perfect. He's amazing. - Speaking of... hi, Karl. - Hi, ladies. Honey. - Bye, Karl. - Bye. I think Rosemary just gave away your surprise about seeing the new house. Well, what do you say? I talked to the realtor, and if we can make it there in a half hour, we can still see it today. I would love to but, honey, I am so busy here. Oh, please, go. Get out of here. I got it. - Seriously? - Yes. Go. Thanks, Jenny. So? Everything you remember? It's gorgeous. Deanna, look, I realize that it's not normal to move so fast, but you've just made me the happiest I've ever been. Well, I guess you got lucky when I made the personal delivery to the charming man on the phone that day. Yes, I'm glad you did. Look, I know that we haven't met each other's families yet or even lived with each other, but... what I'm trying to say is... I can't imagine my life without you, and I don't want to spend another minute not being with you forever, so... Karl. Karl... Will you marry me? Even if it's crazy? - Yes. - Yes? Yes! Oh, and... and I know you want to use your mother's band, so I made sure that it matches perfectly. It's beautiful. And there's just one other little thing. So, it was in escrow, but it's been yours all along. - What? - It's ours. Ours. - Karl... - This is our house. Want to do the honors? - What? - Yes. Karl! Come on. It's all ours. And I've got something to show you in the back yard that I think you'll like. What, what? - Hey. - Surprise! She said yes! She said yes! Yay! Hi. So, honey, for your last surprise, as all of you know, except for my bride-to-be here, the wedding will take place next Sunday at my family's estate in Kentucky. - Wait, what? - I know what you're thinking. There's so much to do in such a short amount of time, but with the help of the people that mean the most to you, along with endless hours of studying your wedding favs on your MyFavs profile, we've made all of your selections available to you where you will finalize things, just as you like, during this week leading up to our big day. And for all of you that can't make it, - let's party now. - Woo! So I'm gonna come in early, and Rosemary and the girls are gonna meet the morning before the rehearsal dinner. If you need me to take care of anything else... How about we just let her enjoy today? And thank you. Hey. - Hey. - You know what this means? What? I finally get to meet your family. Ah, so this is your nice little home? Did I say little? I guess this means you approve of our wedding venue? - Honey, it is breathtaking. - Just remember, they don't know about our house yet, okay? - Yeah. - Okay. Thank you. Oh, mother, this is my fiancée, Deanna. Come here. Oh, my baby's finally home. You've been gone so long, I'm surprised you even recognize me. - Hi. - I'm Ruby. I've heard so much about you. Ah, yes, so much, and in such a short amount of time. You must be starved. - We are. - Great. Sebastian has prepared your favorite, but for now, our tea awaits. Don't worry. She may call it tea, but I call it her happy hour. Chandler, did you forget something? Let Chandler take those up to the room for you. - No, that's not necessary. - I know you city types. I bet you there's work in there, right? Well, maybe just a little. Well, you definitely won't be needing that. This week, it's all about taking care of you. Now, give those to him and come with me. - Okay. - Now. - Thank you. - Of course. It is so beautiful. Thank you. Oh, don't thank me. It was all Karl. He is certainly very good at taking care of things. When a boy loses his father, it can either destroy him or build character. You know, Karl and I are similar in that way. I built my business myself from the ground up. I heard, but I assume making box lunches isn't your long-term goal. It... actually, it is. In fact, studies show that food delivery is the number one growing business among homeowners and expected to increase seven-fold in the next three years. And that hard work is already paying off. I've already secured many high-profile investors that can't wait to be a part of Deanna's Deliveries. Oh. Well, if you'll excuse me, I need to check in with Sebastian about our after-dinner surprise. I confirmed with Sebastian we are going to have the cake tasting directly after dinner: vanilla cream, red velvet and German chocolate. Uh, with... without coconut, of course. - Oh. - Yes. Karl informed us of your unfortunate coconut allergy. It's very serious, Mother. But I figured we might as well at least attempt to have German chocolate by substituting the coconuts with pecans. - Okay. - It's her favorite. Real German chocolate is my favorite. We shall see about this. Come on, I've got something you're totally gonna appreciate. Excuse me. And, senorita, all coconut products have been moved into this cabinet, so please, don't touch, huh? Thank you, Sebastian. I appreciate it. Sure. So, as you can see, it's everything a chef could wish for. Wow. You know, I can only imagine what I could do in this kitchen. Well, I'll let you in on a little family secret. The key to my mom's heart is through her tummy. Really? Well, maybe I could whip up a little something. Oh, that's a great idea. Sebastian, what's on the menu? We are having paella this evening. Of course. Karl's favorite. Yeah. - Are these fresh? - Claro. Those were picked fresh from the garden this morning. In that case, I am going to make my famous roasted red peppers. I am going to need some olive oil and sherry vinegar, please. Coming up. Beautiful and talented. I can see why Karl is so taken by you. Thank you. How about you? You got any special guy in your life? My brother sets a pretty high standard, so it's kind of hard to just, like, fall for anyone when you know what's out there. I definitely agree with you on that one, but, you know, you just got to stay open, keep trying. Yeah, I guess what I'm trying to say is that Karl - and I have a special bond. - Yeah, I know. You know, he said that adopting you was the best decision that they had ever made. We may not be blood, but I feel it's even deeper than that. I have a pretty close relationship with my sister too. I cannot wait for you to meet her. I'd like to think of you as a sister, a real sister, and I hope that you could think of me as the same. Yeah, of course. Adopted, in-laws... they're just words. Family is everything. I warned you my mother could be an acquired taste. She must really love you... Ruby too. Well, you know, after my dad died and my mom adopted Ruby, I had to really step up, be the man of the house. That's why they still depend on me so much. - Hi. - Before you even ask, yes, all of today's orders went out and, yes, I took care of all of the new accounts, and, yes, we are surprisingly surviving without you. - I wasn't even gonna ask. - Yeah, sure. Yeah, well, maybe. More importantly, all of the alterations are finished on your dress. It looks incredible. You're gonna look amazing. All I have to do is fit into my bridesmaid's dress. Oh, stop it. You look amazing. Well, the bride didn't exactly give me a ton of time - to get my wedding body ready. - I miss you. I cannot wait till you're here. I miss you too. Now, in the meantime, go enjoy your wonderful fiancé in his fancy estate, and I'll be here trying to work my way into that dress. - I love you. - I love you. Hey, what are you doing? What are you... what about the strict instructions to not use any coconut in the cake? Sebastian must be experimenting again. Those red peppers were to die for. Did I miss something? Deanna made them. It's a recipe from my business. - I'm impressed. - Thank you. Would you like me to take your plate? No, that's okay. We have people for that. Thank you. And now, the moment we've all been waiting for. - Chandler? - Yes, sir. Here we are. - Why so nervous? - Oh, I just hope they're served at the proper temperature, ma'am. Sebastian left them out. Mmm. Well, they look amazing. They look delicious. Thank you. Thank you. Mm. Uh, Mother, I think it's customary for the bride-to-be to go first. Of course. Delicious. I like the simplicity of the vanilla. Mm-hmm. Ivy, it looks like you're enjoying that German chocolate cake with the pecans. I hope you're not missing the coconut. Mm, it's not bad. "We should have two kinds of cake." Remember when we were kids and we said every birthday party with a cake? Every birthday party. Every time. I'm having some kind of reaction. - Wait, what? - Something's not right. What, you're, you're... Get my EpiPen now. It's in my bag. - What should we do? - Call 911! Karl, hurry! Are you looking for this? I just found it in the trash. Okay. I got it, I got it! Deanna! - Thank God. - Hang in there, sweetie. You're gonna be okay, you're gonna be okay. You'll be okay. We told you no coconut. Where's Sebastian? Sir, I don't know what happened. Where's Sebastian? He went home unexpected... Well, tell him he can stay there permanently. Yes, sir. I'm so sorry. I don't know how Sebastian could have made a mistake like that. Just, please, go get some towels? Yes, sir. - Valentina, ice. Now. - Yes, sir. You're okay. He must have been trying to get something from the top of the silver closet. He must have stood on the shelf to try to reach it. You're right, mom. I've seen him do it before. He must have fallen. We're going to miss him so much. - Sebastian was like family. - I know, Mom. Why don't you guys go to bed? Get some rest. - Good night, son. - Good night. Oh, I'm sorry, dear. Good night, you guys. Feel better. Thank God you're okay. - Good morning, darling. - Good morning. I spoke with Sebastian's family in Spain, and they're gonna do a service in his home town. I, of course, let them know that we'll cover all costs. Well done, son. And how is your fiancé feeling? Deanna's back at it. She's out for a run now. I'm glad she's feeling better. I really like her, by the way. I do hope she makes it back soon. Sienna will be here shortly with the linen swatches. - Sienna? - Why not? She is the top event planner in the area. Mom, I told you, we don't need a planner. Nonsense. Sienna has offered her services out of the kindness of her heart. - That's gonna be awkward. - That's what I said. It's totally inappropriate. Oh, please. You were high school sweethearts. It was years ago. I'm sure Deanna will be more than understanding. Oh, so glad you got your medication in time. You know, I still don't understand how you found it outside in the trash. Yeah, well, sometimes when something doesn't feel right, it usually isn't. Thank you for bringing it in. And congratulations on your engagement to Mr. Davers. Hey, Jimmy, do you know Nicole? I-I... I, um... I... I couldn't help her.Uh... Are you okay? I need my medicine too. Thank you. I, uh... I should get back out and finish trimming the shrubs before it gets too hot around here. These three, they're simple, but they just scream upscale classy without being too gaudy. What do you think? Um, I think that I need to wait for my wife. You mean your fiancé. You haven't walked down the aisle yet. - Hi, what are we doing? - Hey, honey. Hi. This is Sienna Moss. - Nice to meet you. - A pleasure to meet you. She's the who's who of wedding planners. Oh. I'm sorry, but I thought we were doing everything on our own. And I thought a professional opinion would be nice. Ah, I see. Should we get down to business? - Yeah. - Karl was just telling me that you wanted a cream color linen with gold and emerald accents? Yeah, yeah, to match my... Which I actually found surprising, because many, many years ago, I remember he envisioned a gold and sapphire wedding. Because sapphire is his favorite color. I know. Yeah, we've been friends since we were kids. I don't see any reason to sugar coat it, dear. Karl and I were high school sweethearts. And that was a long time ago. Can we get back to the present and focus on the task at hand, please? Yellow gold and emerald to match my mother's wedding ring. Did I... did I miss something? I was under the impression that you would be using Karl's grandmother's wedding ring. It's a Davers tradition. And I always told you, Mother, that I can't guarantee that. It would be up to my bride-to-be. Well, that is very sweet, Ivy, but I'm gonna use my mother's wedding ring. Huh. I would have thought that after you went against tradition with your first engagement, that this time you would be more willing. And again, that was a very, very long time ago. I always thought he should have proposed to you instead of Nicole. Well. This is what I want for my wedding. I think it's beautiful, Deanna. Thank you, Ruby. If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go wash up. Nice to meet you, Sienna. Likewise. We'll talk about this later. Wait, so the chef that poisoned you ended up dead? Yes. I mean, no. Can we just focus on the current problem at hand? Wait, Karl was engaged and never told you? Yes. I guess it was naive of me to think that I would know every single thing about him. It looks like Mr. Perfect just lost points with your girls. What did he say? Well, nothing yet. I guess he's still busy entertaining Sienna, his high school sweetheart. The former fiancée is there? No, another ex. What? Okay, I'm changing our flights. We're coming on the next one out and bringing you home. No, I'll be fine. It's just it's not what I expected. This is why people should just elope. No family. No other people. I know, but once we're married and start our lives together, everything is going to be as magical as it has been these past few months. Look, it's totally normal to feel overwhelmed. Everything's going to be fine. Do you remember what Mom used to say? "Things may seem tough..." "But you're tougher." I got to go. I love you girls. - Love you. - See you tomorrow. I'm sorry. Well, it has certainly been an eventful trip so far. - It has. - Informative too. I know. I should have told you about Nicole. So why didn't you? You must have known it was gonna come up. I mean, we're with your family discussing our wedding plans. I know. I don't know, you know? I just... I didn't want anything from my past to change the way you feel about me. How, because you were engaged when you were young? It's not just that. Then what? Honey, you don't have to be perfect, just honest, okay? There was an accident. That's why we never got married. An accident? It was a week before the wedding. You know, Nicole and I... we wanted to elope, but Ruby begged us to have the ceremony here. She wanted to be the flower girl. How could I say no to that, right? I shouldn't have left her. Where? What happened? There was a fire, and it was too strong, and I couldn't save her. Is that what happened to the carriage house? I'll never go anywhere near there, ever. She died because I didn't protect her. I am so sorry. Hey, but you have to know it was an accident. It wasn't your fault, okay? Hey, I... I promise that I will never let that happen again. Nothing is going to happen to me. To us. Thank you for telling me. Rise and shine, sleepyhead. It is a beautiful day out. Who wants to go outside when we could just pass time in here all day? Whatever would we do with our time? Ooh, I got a couple ideas. - It's gone. - What is? My necklace. It was right here. I took it off before bed. It was right here. - Are you sure? - Yeah, when we got home. Oh, my God. When you were sleeping, there was someone in here. I heard the door. Why didn't you wake me up? Because I didn't know for sure, but... Okay, okay, all right, honey, let's just stay calm, all right? I'm sure it just fell behind the nightstand. Mm-mm. No, no, I am telling you, someone was in here and they took it. I'm sure there's an explanation, all right? Why don't you check the bathroom? It's not here. Now do you believe me? That it's gone, yes, I do, but not that somebody took it. I mean, come on, is it that far-fetched? First someone takes my EpiPens. They go missing. And now, someone's taken my mother's wedding band. Come on, Karl. You know how much it means to me. I know, I know, I know, okay? We'll fix it, starting right now. I got an idea. I'm sorry, honey. It doesn't look like anyone's there. No, we have to find it. Chandler, can you gather the entire staff and have them meet us in the kitchen? Of course, sir. I'm so sorry. We will find your necklace, I promise. Come here. We'll find it. Why did you call this urgent staff meeting, Karl? The necklace with my mom's ring has disappeared. Oh, that's the reason for this meeting? Are you accusing my staff of thieving, Deanna? What? No, no, of course not. Why don't I just check the security cameras? We already did. There's nothing. Hmm, well, I'm sure there's a simple explanation, and we'll all be laughing about this soon. Perhaps it fell down yesterday during your impromptu couple's getaway, hmm? No, Ivy, I had it with me last night before bed. Mm. Then it's a good thing we have my mother's ring as backup. I'm sure it'll pop up, dear. While we're out on the river today, it's your main objective to find Deanna's mom's ring, understand? - Yes, ma'am. - Thank you. Than you, Ruby. Hey, I didn't know you were coming. I couldn't pass up an invitation for a family cruise. It'll be like old times. Just want to make sure the bride-to-be gets the full Davers experience. Good morning. So glad you could join us, Sienna. Hello, everyone. Deanna, you're gonna love this. When I gets hot, we can go swimming. Oh, actually, Deanna can't swim. You're joking. I didn't grow up around water, but I'm fine on boats. This will be nice. More time for sunbathing. You didn't tell me Sienna was coming. I didn't know. I'm sorry. Come on. Ever since I was a kid, I loved cruising out on this river. It's so quiet and peaceful. It really is beautiful. Karl, dear, I could use a refill. Oh, sure thing, Mother. Thank you, dear. I hope you don't mind my being here. With the wedding only two days away, I figured we could get some work done. We still need to finalize the flower arrangements and pick the entertainment. Yeah, we've also hit a snag with my wedding ring. - It's gone missing. - I heard. - It was my mother's. - I'm so sorry. Ivy insinuated that I accused the staff of stealing it. If it makes you feel any better, Ivy didn't warm up to me until Karl and I broke up. I was never good enough for her perfect prince. - So it's not just me? - No, not at all. It's who you are to Karl. Don't take it personally. I need another one. Can I get you anything? No, I'm fine. Thanks. I hope Sienna isn't being too Sienna for you. - Come on, she's not that bad. - That's exactly what I mean. It's how she operates. She gets you on her side and then she goes in for the kill. She actually gave me some good advice. Just be careful. She's never stopped loving Karl after all these years, and that's what she always does, just looks out for Sienna. Good to know. Sisters got to look out for each other, right? Hey, honey. You know, Sienna just had a great suggestion that we get some more photos for our wedding blog. There's a nice little spot on the deck back here. I'll grab my phone. I love taking pictures. Sure. Move a little bit to your left. That's it. Deanna, try putting your hair over your shoulder, - Say cheese. - Cheese. I want one of Karl by himself. Sure. Try a 3/4 turn. - All right? - Yeah, that's right. All right, chin out. That's it. Flex those guns, Karl. Work it, work it. Okay, okay. All right, okay, okay. That's enough of just me. Let's get some of just Deanna. - No. - Honey, come on. You're the bride. I-I really don't want to. Deanna, trust me, these photos are gonna be stunning. You'll thank us later. Okay. Don't be camera-shy. Give us some attitude. You're a superhero. Hands on your hips. Chest out. That's it. Wonderful. Sienna, dear, we need some demure photos of Deanna too. Absolutely. Um... Okay, now just relax. Maybe lean back. Strike a casual pose. That's it. That's beautiful. Uh, Ruby, are you taking... Whoa! Deanna! Hey, honey, I'll be right back, okay? Mm. I'm so sorry. Oh, it was an accident. Yeah, it looks that way. Sometimes things aren't always what they seem. What do you mean? Get some rest. See you guys. Would you like Nick to give you a lift home? No, I'm just gonna walk. You sure you don't want us to call Dr. Mullen? He can swing by, check you out. I'll be okay. Deanna, dear, I hate to be the bearer of more bad news, but the staff hasn't been able to find your mother's ring. What? No, no, I don't understand. We won't stop looking until we find it. It looks as if your wedding week has been something of a nightmare thus far. Yeah, well, the good news is, is we still have a chance to turn it all around, right? Is there anything we can get you? No, thanks. I think I'm just gonna rest up until Jenny gets in later tonight. You do that. Or, better yet, why don't you go take a sauna? That would be so nice. Weren't we gonna run into town and run a few errands? Yes, of course. We'll meet you downstairs. Well, it looks like you're chipping away at Mother's armor. Yeah, all it took was almost dying... twice. Ugh. Mom is right. Why don't you go take a sauna? It might help you relax. Maybe. It does sound nice. Okay, we're just gonna run into town, run a few errands. Okay. Don't worry, be back long before Jenny gets in tonight. Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Thanks. Hi. Welcome, welcome. - Thank you. No peeking. - I'll, I'll... Jenny, this is my mother, Ivy, and my little sister, Ruby. Hi. I have heard so much about you. So, um... so Deanna still doesn't know that I'm here a little early, right? No, it's still a surprise. One thing we Davers are good at: keeping family secrets. She's just right upstairs. She has no idea you're here. - Okay. - Come on. She's gonna be so excited. Surprise. Hey, you're here. Wait, did you guys plan this? We thought you could use some of your real family here to make you feel more at ease. Thank you. Now, what's this I hear about a sauna? I'm sure you two have some catching up to do. - We'll see you a little later. - Okay, thank you. - Hi. - I am so glad you're here. I missed you. This house... Isn't it wild? I knew it. This was deliberately cut. Do you know how many times I tried to talk myself out of believing that you actually killed Nicole? Deep down, I know you did it. I just couldn't believe it. This time, I saw it with my own two eyes. I know you cut that rail, and now, I've got the pictures to prove it. Ahh! Oh, my God. I'm so glad you're here. You know, I almost cut the whole thing off today. What? I just wanted out of here. Why would anyone want to leave this place? Come on. It's not just about that. Well, what's it about? You know what? Let's just focus on moving forward. From now on is a fresh start to the week because you're here. Damn it, damn it, I left my pills in the garden room. Where are you going? I'm just gonna go cool off in the pool. Is everything all right? I saw a strange guy going through the yard. What? What did he look like? Middle aged, kind of scruffy, running with a limp. Oh, that's Jimmy, the grounds keeper. He had an accident and injured his leg years ago. He's a good guy. Hey, relax. My pills. Pills... My... my pills. My pills. You know what, maybe I will just go check on Jimmy, just to make sure he's okay. Yeah. Did you lock the door? No, no, I didn't lock the door. It just opened before. Look, there's a key in there. - What? - The key's turned. Hi, please, don't hurt me. Please, I didn't see anything. I won't say anything. Your secret's safe with me. My heart is... I need those pills. Give me the... I need... my heart is... please. That... I always knew it was you. - Hey, let us out! - Hello! It's really hot in here. - Somebody, let us out! - Help! Karl, let us out of here! Oh, dear. We were stuck in there. I have asked Jimmy 100 times to fix that door. It gets jammed every now and then. It wasn't jammed. It was locked. It's okay, Deanna. We're out now. No, it is not okay. Nothing around here is okay. This is what I was trying to tell you. Every... Oh, good, you found them. Are you all right? No, I am not all right. We were locked in. Oh, the door was jammed. That's all. Come on, we're just going over final seating arrangements. Yes. You will be so glad to know that Sienna has removed herself from the wedding. What? What do you mean? She texted me. She said she left the wedding. That's one less thing to worry about, right? And we have everything under control, but it does mean there'll be lots of work for us. You guys go ahead. I need to talk to Karl. We were locked in, Karl. Honey, I think you're just a little extra sensitive because of what happened out on the water. No, it's not just that. Okay, why don't we just go take your mind off things? - We need to go check on Jimmy. - Jimmy? Jenny said she saw him. He didn't seem right. That's because he's not. Jimmy hasn't been right since my dad died. What do you mean? Jimmy was my dad's best friend, and he was considered a possible suspect in his death. Wait, you told me that your dad died from some freak dehydration accident. He did, but there was an investigation. After Jimmy was cleared, it caused him so much stress that he had a stroke, and he lost everything. He was like family to us, so my mom offered him the grounds keeping job to keep him close. Honey, you are so sweet to be concerned. Trust me, Jimmy's okay, so why don't we go focus on something more important, like our wedding. Yeah, sure. At this point, I just want to get through the ceremony. As much as I hate to admit it, Sienna was a big help. Well, everything's back on track to make your big day perfect. I brought your dress and a couple pairs of shoes for you to try on. There's just one thing missing. What? Don't stress about all the little things. We'll get it all figured out. What really matters is you and Karl, right? Right? I don't think I can wear Mom's ring. Why? You promised her. - It's gone. - Gone? Yeah, it's missing. At first, I thought that someone had stolen it, but maybe I did lose it. Maybe, maybe when I was on a run, it fell off my necklace. I just don't know any more. Didn't you say that Ivy was really pushy about you wearing her mother's ring? Yeah. And you don't find that coincidental in the least? It did cross my mind at first, but, look, Ivy may be difficult... That's one way of putting it. But she's not gonna steal our mom's ring. Deanna, you don't know these people. Look, if she did steal it, then there's only one way of finding out. - Where are you going? - To get Mom's ring. - What, now? - Yes, now. Look, it's my mom's ring too, okay, and if you're not gonna wear it, then I am. I'm sorry, but I don't care about disrupting the precious Davers family household. Let's go. - This isn't a good idea. - This is a fantastic idea. Let's split up. It'll go faster that way. There's the sister I know. We don't have much time. Dinner is in 15 minutes. You check the drawers. I'll check the bathroom. - Are you finding anything? - It's not here. Karl, where are our guests? Dinner is being served. I was just about to go get them, Mother. Well, chop, chop. Any luck? No, I've checked all the drawers. I just don't get it. What? How is Ruby there? - What do you mean? - Karl told me that they adopted Ruby after his father died. That's his father. There's Ruby. Mom? What are you doing in my mom's room? I'm sorry, Ruby, but I just can't let go of the fact that nobody can find my mom's ring. - Our mom's ring. - I'm sure you understand. I know one thing. My mom wouldn't be as understanding if she caught you looking in here. - I know, but... - Don't worry. I won't tell her. It'll be our secret amongst sisters. Thanks. Now, let's go before she finds us. Oh, good, you're all here. Dinner is ready. - I'll see you guys down there. - I'll join you. What were you doing in my mom's room? Anything you want to tell me? You first. I thought your family adopted Ruby after your father died. We did. But I just saw a picture of Ruby with your father. Because we met her at a charity program before he died. My dad never felt that just anyone should be allowed to be a Davers, so it wasn't until after he passed that my mom and I adopted her. I told you all of this. - No, no, you didn't. - Well, yeah. I mean, that's what we've always said, it's crazy how something so amazing came out of something so tragic. All right, now your turn. What were you doing in my mom's room? It was nothing. Just something between us girls. Ruby, why don't you tell them about the surprise you've planned for the bridal party tomorrow? I would like to take us all on a drive up the coast. The view and the terrain are really worth it. Oh, sounds cool. Thanks. Yeah, that does sound nice, Ruby, but I've already planned something for the girls tomorrow, and unfortunately, I can't cancel. You didn't tell me. You tell me everything. I know. It was supposed to be a surprise for my fiancée and her friends, and for you too, of course. What is it? Well, I've planned for you all to spend the day at the River Club tomorrow. Oh, the River Club. It is a wonderful café right on the water. Yeah, it will be a day of nothing but relaxation, wine, and whatever it is you girls like to talk about. Thank you, Karl. That is so thoughtful. Such a divine idea. It is. Would you excuse me? I am not feeling too well. Well, of course. Thanks. You'll have to excuse her. She sometimes takes things a little personally. I'll be right back. Excuse me. Hey. You know, maybe we can go on that drive some other time. Forget it. It had to be tomorrow. Well, it was a really nice thought. I just wanted to do something special for you and your friends. I love Karl so much, and I just wanted him to think that I was the best sister ever. He does. He appreciates you so much. Did he say that? He doesn't have to. You know, Karl made me a promise, and Karl never breaks his promises. Well, what did he promise? He promised that he'd never leave us. You wouldn't understand. Try me. It's just when you own mother gives you away, there's this part of you that always worries that you'll never be enough, and if you're not, they won't stay. That's a heavy burden to carry. But, you know, Ruby, I don't think anybody's leaving you, but sometimes in life, circumstances change, and we have to adapt. What if they didn't have to change? Karl and I are starting a life together after the wedding. So circumstances aren't changing. You are the change. I'm gonna let you rest up for tomorrow. It's gonna be a fun day, right? Yes, I'm looking forward to meeting your friends. Hey, thanks for the talk, Sis. I feel so much better. Just tell them I'll be right out. Of course. I love you so much. He's mine. Woo! You know, Karl was right. This was a great idea after all. You guys, this is my favorite song. We have to go dance. Come on! Be right there. Well, it didn't take her long to warm up to our friends. No, not long at all. She is surprising in all sorts of ways. What's with all the texts to Sienna? What is she, your best friend now? No, but, you know, oddly enough, I feel like she is the one person who could help me out right now. I can't get ahold of her. I feel like something's not right. Oh, hi, Dimitri. The chairs and tables have arrived for the rehearsal dinner, and Mrs. Davers would like them set up according to the floor plan by 4:00. Pardon me, sir. The wedding coordinator needs to finalize your selections today. Will there be any changes? No, no, Deanna's thrilled with everything. Wonderful. So I'll just need to get Miss Moss's signature. Were you not informed that Sienna's - no longer handling the event? - It's not a problem. Lee Robinson always does a fabulous job. His signature will do. Of course. Would you like to come with me, sir? Did you respond to Sienna's text? I didn't feel like it was appropriate. Mm. Would you like me to check on her? Better yet, I could phone her parents. - Maybe after the wedding. - All right. Karl, I'm so sorry I invited Sienna. - I just thought... - You thought that if I ended up with someone from here, then I would never leave again. Is it so wrong for a mother to want her son close by? No, but you should want your son to be happy. Oh, honey, I do... and now I can see that you really are. I am. I really am. Thanks, Mom. You better go get dressed. - Oh. - Our guests will be arriving - before we know it. - Yes, okay. I'm glad there's 17 bathrooms in this place, 'cause we all have to get ready. Oh, so we each get our own bathroom? Of course. - That was so fun. - This is amazing. This is Jimmy's. I know. Thank you. Thank you! Hey, Jenny, can you please tell Karl I'll be right up? - Yeah. - Thanks. Dibs on the big one! Ah, oh, my God. Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy? Jimmy. Help! Help! No, not Jimmy! He was like family. Don't touch me. I'm calling an ambulance. No, I will. And even knowing the seriousness of his heart condition, one can never be truly prepared. This is a sad day, but fortunately, we also have a joyous event to celebrate. Karl will make all the necessary arrangements after tomorrow. But, for now, none of this leaves the room. I'm sure we can all do that for the bride and the groom. Now, let's all put on our smiling faces and put on an evening that only the Davers could pull off. Showtime. Hey, you okay? No, I am not okay. I guess I'm not gonna make a very good Davers. You see, I don't have the ability to just sweep another death under the rug to entertain your precious guests. - Deanna, it's... - No, he saved my life, Karl. We should have done something. I'm really struggling to keep all the family secrets straight. And so the whole rest of the afternoon, Deanna wouldn't stop saying that she'd finally met her Prince Charming. Aww. Deanna, um, it's just been the two of us for quite some time now, and I know that if Mom and Dad were here, they would be so proud of you, and Dad always used to say that we were his little princesses, and to me, you have always been a princess, and I'm just so happy for you that you finally found your happily ever after. So please, everyone, raise a glass to my beautiful sister, Deanna, and Karl. Congratulations. Here, here. - I have something to say. - Not tonight, sweetheart. - I'm fine, Mom. - Thanks, Jenny. You are right about one thing. I think we all can agree that Karl really is a Prince Charming. I also remember the first time I met Karl. It was love at first sight for me too. Of course, he has the good looks. Am I right? But more importantly, he's loyal... - I'm gonna stop her. - A protector, and those are what make up a good husband, but an even better brother. Normally, this would be a devastating time for any sister seeing her brother starting a new and separate life with his bride, but not our Karl. Here's to you. Apparently, there's no bride at this rehearsal dinner. I love you so much, and I'm so happy you're starting your new life back here at home... - What? - With us. Thank you, Ruby. Thank you, dear. Thank you. And thank all of you for coming out here to celebrate our soon-to-be Mr. and Mrs. Davers. Karl, I believe it's your turn now to make a toast to your beautiful bride-to-be. - Excuse me. - Dee. - I got this. - No, Jenny, please. Deanna? Deanna? Deanna. You want to explain that? I can't control what my sister says. Oh, is that another Davers trait, not accepting responsibility? Just hang in there, please. After tomorrow, everything will be fine. If I make it till then. What do you want me to do? Stop living in denial. I'm just trying to get us through this week and focus on our wedding and not... not deal with the same things that I always had to deal with with my family. Oh, like your sister's sick obsession with you? Do you realize that all of tonight could have been avoided if you hadn't have put Ruby's feelings and some silly childhood promise above the woman that you're supposed to be marrying tomorrow? What do you mean, "supposed to be?" Do you still want to marry me? Listen to me, listen to me, I will fix this. I'll go tell Ruby right now that her delusional idea of me staying here forever is not reality. I would do anything to keep from losing you. I just wish that we could go back to before we came here. I know, me too. I do want to start our life together in our house. Just us. That's how it will be. Okay? I love you more than anything in the world, more than I have ever loved anyone. And I promise, I will never leave you. Excuse me. Is everything okay? I'll... I'll be out there in a second. Trust me. Do you agree with her? Was it just some silly childhood promise you made me when I was a kid? Ruby, things change. You've never lied to me. You've been the only one. And I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt you. We're adults now, and my wife has to come first. Deanna and I bought a house together and that's where we're gonna live after we're married. Would you really never talk to us again? No, I mean, no, of course not. But if she asked you to, you wouldn't? I really don't think that's gonna happen. - Yeah, but what if she does? - Ruby, stop! I love you, but you are my sister. That's it. And family is everything. So, there's something I have to tell you. What? I've made arrangements to have your mother's ring duplicated. It'll be ready when we get home. Karl. I mean, I know it's not the same thing, but I hope it helps. I love you, Nicole, and I cannot wait to make you my wife. Okay, one more week. Karl, help! Karl, help! Okay. Aww! - It's perfect. - Thank you. Wow. You look beautiful. I want to give you a hug, but you look too perfect to touch. It's time to give the groom the ring, but from what I hear, it's a temporary one. Well, just until we can find the original. If we find it. Of course, we hope to find it. No matter what, it's gonna be a memorable day. Oh, well, thanks again for coming, boys. I know I'm the last one to tie the knot, but you know me. I always hold out for the best option available. You guys decent? The final piece. Do you guys mind giving me a moment alone with the groom? Yeah, I'll meet you out there in just a few minutes, guys. I just want you to know, I've had some time to think about what you said last night. I can only imagine the situation I put you in, and the last thing in the world I would ever want to do is cause you or the bride any added stress, and I am so sorry. Like you said, we're adults, and from here on out, I'm gonna start acting like one. Wow. And thank you, Ruby. I couldn't be happier for you and Deanna. After all, isn't that what sisters are for? Yeah, and I want you to know that no matter how far away I am, we'll always be close, okay? Never forget that. Come here. Well, what are we still doing in here? - I know. - There's a lucky girl waiting for you. May I? Oh. Mm? - You're all set. - All right. - See you out there. - See you out there. Hey, did you get my message? Karl's all set, so we're good to go. Great. I'll cue the prelude music to begin. I'll tell the girls. - Okay. - This is it. Right, let's do this. There's a text from Karl. "Meet me at the carriage house right away. We have to talk." Why would he want to meet at the carriage house? I don't understand. What do you think he means? Where's Ruby? - She never came back. - I have to go. - Really? - Yes. I have to know for sure. - Know what? - Stall for me. You want to talk, Ruby? I know it's you. Karl would never come down here. None of it was really an accident, was it? I'm done talking. You're not gonna get between Karl and I. Not today! Those are my thoughts exactly. Ah! Mrs. Davers. - What are you doing? - Um, so the bride is just running a little bit behind. What's going on? Where is Deanna? She and Karl had to meet to discuss something. Right now? What are you talking about? I'm right here, and I'm ready to get married. You texted Deanna to meet you at the carriage house. No, I didn't. I saw it. My phone's missing. I'm sorry, ma'am, but... What could possibly be so important right now? The police just called. Sienna Moss has been found dead. - What? - Where? Down by the dock. They discovered her body in the river floating by the yacht. Where's Ruby? She was here just a few minutes ago. Carriage house. Carriage house! So, you're awake. This isn't gonna end the way you think it is, Ruby. This is gonna end exactly the way it did for Nicole. - What? - Karl. Ruby. - Just get out, Karl! - What's going on? Let me finish. Ruby, it's over. Yes, it will be soon enough, and we can go back to being a family: you, me, and Mom. You're not thinking clearly, Karl. She ruined everything. They always do. We could have been so happy here. We still can be, Ruby. We will be, okay, but you got to put that down. Let me guess, you promise. I do, and we can walk out of here right now. Just like you promised her last night that you wouldn't leave her? That is why she can't be in the picture! We will walk out of here, just not with her. I am so sorry. I am so sorry. Get... here! What have you done? Stop it, Ruby! Just stop it! Karl, Karl. Are you...? Oh, my. Karl, are you okay? Ugh, ugh, ugh. We need to get out of here. Come on. It wasn't supposed to be like this. You'll never understand. How you can kill people? No. You'll never understand what it's like to never be enough, to just be pushed to the side. Come on, Ruby. I lost my mom too. I didn't lose her. I told you, she gave me away. Karl and Ivy are the only ones who ever loved me. Is that why you killed Mr. Davers, because he didn't want you either? I did whatever I had to do to keep us together. You understand, right? Isn't it what you wanted? No, no. Just let us get out of here. We can all be a family. No, you're not family. I love you. I love you more than anybody ever will. No, no, no. Ruby, Ruby, no! - Ruby! - Come on. - Ruby! Ruby! - Come on. Come on, get out. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm going back in. - No, no. Deanna, I can't lose you. It's your turn to trust me. Deanna! - That's so cute. - You three ready in here? Everybody's waiting. Especially for our little guest of honor. Yeah, we'll be right out. Well, I think the renovations went well. I did give up my man cave, but I like this spot better. Well, you know what they say. A family makes a house a home. Yes, and I think this little girl will be the perfect addition to our house. - You mean home. - Right. Ooh. Are they coming for me today? Not today, Miss Davers. I'm sorry. I know they will. Family is everything.
