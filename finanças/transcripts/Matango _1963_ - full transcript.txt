MATANGO TOKYO MEDICAL CENTER This is the psychopathic ward. I know. They think I'm insane. But I'm not. She's dead. The other too. Actually only one died. Yes, they're all alive. Then why don't they come back? If I told you the truth, you'd believe I'm insane too. The sky, the sea and the wind. We left everything behind. Everything? Tokyo and all her dust. You shouldn't say that. Why? That's where your money and men are. Oh, yeah? My manuscript! Forget about your work. That was one of my best stories. You always say that. Oh, yeah? Her first time? It gets to them when they can't see land. This is my first time, too. You're different. Why, she's never been kissed yet. I'm the one that's normal. What's the matter. Professor... Do you feel sea-sick? I guess I'm not... ...good at mingling. They're all nice fellows. They would be good friends to have. Yes. You can listen while you work. I want to look too. Miss Mami is very beautiful. Just like on TV. Is she single or married? She's a top lady. You mean a mistress? Let's drink a toast. Wait. This toast has a deep meaning. We are on the open sea away from the masses of humanity. Aren't we supposed to be humans too? From the rest of humanity, then. I'd better check the wind. Wait a second. As the skipper, I give the orders. To Akiko, welcome to our group. Cheers! We're in for rough seas tonight. The radio? Yeah, it said there's a low pressure area off Kyushu. It seemed like perfect weather. Let's head for home. They want to keep going. They're a queer bunch. A bunch of playboys. Kind of old to be boys. They'll always be boys. They live and play around on their fathers' money. Go back if you feel worried. I asked how you felt. If you don't feel confident... Personally, I'd like to go on. A little rough weather is part of sailing. We have two ladies with us. Don't mind me. I'm not scared. And you, Akiko? I don't mind either. Don't worry. This yacht is the best that money can buy. Skipper! Skipper! Come over here! What's the matter? Look at that! We'd better change course. Everyone! On deck! To the jib! Okay. Are you all ready? Okay! Just remember what Kasai said. No expenses were spared in building this. Do you know what it cost? 40 million yen! Really absurd! But he promised me a trip to Europe this fall. I'll be singing in Paris, Rome, Vienna... Isn't it wonderful? Let's run away from it. How is it? Nothing to worry about. Were you scared? Feel all right? Yes. Good. We're headed for home now. All right. Take down the mainsail! I hear you teach psychology. Yeah. To get a girl... You scare them first... ...then treat them tender, right? That's not psychology. That's a paperback novel. Change places with Murat. I'll do it! Are you all right? There's nothing to worry about. The auxiliary engine! Hurry! Throw over the sea anchor! All right. The mast is gone! Get inside! Everybody inside! Listen! This boat will never sink! Trust me! The wireless broke down. It's your responsibility! The engine won't run! Did you check it? What? Where's Yoshida? He's... Yoshida! Yoshida! You all right? Are you all right? Are you all right? Yoshida! It's hopeless! They'll have search parties out for us, won't they? Probably... We're drifting. Yeah... To the south. South? Our position? The radar's busted too. Just drifting? That's right. As the skipper... Skipper? Have you ever followed my orders? I'm just a hired skipper! I feel so depressed. Don't waste the battery! That's our only link! It's time for the news. Hope has been virtually abandoned. The personnel on the yacht are the owner Mr. Kasai, of Kasai Industries... ...the skipper, Mr. Sakuta, an employee of Kasai, Mr. Yoshida, a writer... ...Ms. Mami Sekiguchi, a singer, Mr. Murat, a university professor... ...Ms. Akiko Soma, a university clerk... ...and Mr. Koyama, a sailor employed for the trip. Their last hope is Mr. Sakuta's skill as a veteran yacht skipper... The battery's gone. It's a boat. Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Watch it! Watch it! Hey, watch it! What happened? Hey! Yoshida! Wake up! Wake up! Hey... When will this fog clear up? Is there enough water? Stop that! It'll only tire you out. I feel as if we'll never get back. What is it? It's nothing! Cut that out! Everyone knows what you're after. Why didn't you want to go back? Girls and boats don't mix, but not because it makes the sea goddess mad... ...but because it makes the men go crazy. It's an island. It's an island! It's an island, it's an island! It's an island! Hey, wake up! Is this Japan? A part of Ogasawara, I think. An uninhabited island? We must find food and water! Fog again. This fog will Kill us. What are you going to do? You don't have to come. What's up? It's water! Can't you hear it? It's water! There's water here! Fresh water! Water? Look at this rock. There are people here. Human hands laid these stones! Shouldn't we turn back? Someone's been through here. Let's go to the other side. We might find houses. Are we climbing this? Careful with your footing. Look at that! It's a ship. We'll go down over there. Hello. Hello! Wait! It's a derelict. Look, the sails are rotted. It was washed ashore. More than a year has passed. Let's go. There might be someone. Hey, let's go and see. Nobody is here. If there is, it's a corpse or a skeleton. Now, stop that. They would have eaten all the food. Yoshida. Wait here while we go and look. Yeah, let's go. They were catching rain water. Someone was living here. What happened? The steps are slimy with moss. No one here. No corpse either. Look at the mold! What's that? Oh, it's you! Not even a bug to eat. Let's go up and see too. A pump for sea water. A radiation meter. This is an oceanography ship. The color of the mold is different. It has no eyes. It's a mutation caused by radiation. It was survey ship looking for sea water pollution. Why is this shelf free from mold? It's this disinfectant. The alcohol lamp is clean too. It's vulnerable to chemicals. The carbolic acid! We can clean up the ship. What's in here? A monster mushroom! Mat an go... a species of mushroom. A new type found on this island. If it was only edible. It doesn't say one way or the other. Someone removed the mirrors. Let's go. The captain's room... What happened? What happened? Look. Stop! It's the captain's room. There might be a ship's log here. Koyama. Koyama. Hey, what's the meaning of this? Who's that? Don't look at me like that. Finder's keepers, you know. Everything's strange. What nationality is this boat? It's been concealed purposely. It's fitted with items from both communist and western countries... ...even from Japan. A spy vessel? It's connected with nuclear tests. I guess you could call it a spy boat. By the way... What are we going to do now? Get Kasai to come here, too. We're in this together. Want something? Kasai... We only have a week's supply of food left. You can't stay in here alone. What can we do? We can find means to keep on living! Let's all talk it over. I've been working, too. I fixed this so it'll shoot. With this, we can hunt birds, animals and snakes. Come on, everyone. Let's get going. According to the ship's log, this island is uninhabited. With very little food, it'll be hard work to stay alive. We must get away from here. We have enough provisions to last us for another week. We must gather everything edible, fish, seaweed, turtle eggs... But not mushrooms. Are they poisonous? The test reports say they contain nerve affecting agents. There's food but there's no survivors. There should be corpses but those are missing too. The mushrooms seem to be the cause. It says that the crew members started disappearing in twos and threes. I think they started eating them from hunger and that was it. I want to bring the yacht here for repairs. With all this fog, no ship will come near here. We must go out. We must be ready. In that broken-down yacht? Not me. Be more serious! We're closer to the equator than Japan, right? What good will that boat do us? All we have to do is find a ship! On the boat, you can order us around as the skipper. But not here. We're on land. Yoshida! Stop acting so big! Who's acting big? I'm just trying to find some way out of this! You'll spoil everything by fighting. The girls will get water. Someone has to look for food. Someone has to build smoke signals. I got you. How can you write like that? He's not writing anything original. He's a genius at borrowing someone else's ideas. There's no law against it. It's part of training oneself. This is how literature developed in the first place. Every modern story stole its plot from something someone else wrote. Hi. She has finally agreed to join us. Hello, everyone. You must wear this now. We haven't seen a single bird yet. All the ship's mirrors were gone. Why would they bring them here and break them? There must be a reason. Did the bird see us? It seemed to avoid this island. You mean even birds shun this place? Mr. Sakuta. Over there, too. It's a ship graveyard. It may be the current. It pulls the boats here in the fog and grounds them. Hey. You fool! Fool? I came to give you girls a hand. Give me that. Look, mushrooms. Shouldn't we eat them if we're starving? Hey... It was around here. Something moved, didn't it? Yeah. Maybe we were mistaken. Let's go. Gee... No one's back yet? Hey! What is it? There's someone outside. Who is it? You can't trust anyone! You must be careful, too! What's wrong? No more battery power. Who is it? Did you hear that? Yeah. Koyama. Koyama. Did you open that? What's it to you? Where did you go? The toilet! Do you mind? Who is it? It's me. Oh, it's you. Someone was on the deck. Yes. Maybe it was Kasai. Someone come here quick! Come here! What happened, Kasai? What is it? Koyama! Yoshida! Wake up! Open your eyes, everyone! In Tokyo, you can all do anything you want! Now you're seeing ghosts! There's one reason for such delusions! It's these beauties dancing before your eyes! You're frustrated! I admit I feel the same way. I'll borrow this one tonight. Why doesn't someone say something? Not even a snicker. Darn it. I'll kill you! You want to try? Cut it out! Let me go! Don't press your luck! She takes walks into the jungle with the writer. And not to get water, either. That's my business! Look. She confessed it. I know what kind of girl Mami is. I only stuck around you because I wanted to go to Europe. You've lost all your appeal now. You... Stop that! Koyama, you think we saw illusions? That's right. Come here and look. You too, Yoshida. You still think we saw ghosts? We must concentrate on fixing the yacht and getting away from here. Are you through? You go around the forest with the gun. Looking for food? Hey! Let me have my say! You must try each blade of grass! Taste each new bud! That's the way to find food! Have you found any yet? You! You may be a big shot in Tokyo! But here, you really have to bear down and work! You too. A professor and a writer! We should look for food in the rain also! As long as we can see, we must keep searching! Let's go pick up clams and seaweed in the ocean! Akiko... Akiko... Akiko... This is Mother... I quit. What good is a boat without food? I'll look for food. What's wrong with you? Aren't you ashamed? Who was trying to steal food in the first place? Don't tell me it was a ghost. But it was. I followed it. Don't lie! Why would a ghost try to cover up with empty cans? No one believes a word you say. They're just avoiding trouble. Think about that before you start criticizing me! What're you going to do? Don't worry. I'm going to go after this ghost that you all say you saw. Yoshida. Don't go. That thing may be human. It may be a crew member from this boat. If it is, we'd better discuss things. Frayed nerves can cause people to see a lot of strange things. That's when they see witches and devils. Yoshida. Hey, Yoshida! All this after working all day. We've done our share. Yes, we have. Mr. Sakuta. Knock before you come in. I'll keep this. You've been drinking. You'll sleep with us. I can't sleep unless I'm alone! You're going to work too! You... Who looked after your family? I put you through college and hired you? Yeah. Presumably as a friend, but actually you bought me. That's wonderful. What about these? What are they? Turtles. They're rich in protein. Two apiece. There are 14. But none to lazy guys like you! No, thank you. I'm full. Hey... You ate mushrooms, didn't you? Figure it out yourself. I won't need supper tonight. 10,000 yen apiece. Not enough. It was 5,000 yesterday. Eggs are getting scarce now. There's 200,000 here. It's a big gamble. Maybe I'll never spend these. No, I'll definitely use this! Even if the rest of you die! What do you think you're doing? You dirty rat! You want to fight? Oh, yeah? Come on. Sakuta, Sakuta! Stop fighting, you two. Stop it, Yoshida. Cut it out! He and that girl... You jealous? We made a rule. That doesn't excuse violence! Everyone wants me. I'll kill everyone! Did you... I ate a stomachful of mushrooms. I read about this somewhere... How people became intoxicated after eating mushrooms. Don't move! There's the story about the laughing mushrooms. Some people started dancing after eating mushrooms. If you eat matango, you become inhuman. I can Kill you all without regret then. All right, you can do as you please. Don't worry, I will. I think I prefer AkKiko to Mam.. After you're all dead... Let me go! Stand up! Start walking! What happened? Go inside! What is all this? I told you to join the rest! Sakuta! Hard at work, eh? The jib-sail seems to be ready. Isn't it already in shape for sailing? You came to help? I'll be glad to. I wanted to have a little talk with you. We always seem to be quarreling amongst ourselves. You listening? Yeah. There is only three days' food left. It'll last ten days for two. Let's you and I take this yacht! With potatoes and seaweed, we can survive. We'll take plenty of water. Enough for 20 days. We'll find help by then. Get out! Okay. I got you. Under trying conditions, man tends to become selfish and cruel. That's when we must act in a rational manner. We must help each other. He did it again. What's wrong, Kasai? Sakuta took all the food and left! Darn it. Darn it. He fooled us. You can only trust yourself. Guys who act big are the most unreliable. Sakuta didn't care about you at all. Mami, bring the girl here. You... No, let me go. Let me go! I'll kill you. Turn around, walk toward the deck. Professor... There is always a situation like this in my novels. Koyama! Leave this ship! Mr. Kasai... Please... You chose Yoshida. Leave! It doesn't always work the way you want. Stop that! It's been raining for a week. Maybe it's the rainy season? If so, we can't stay on this boat. Where can we go? Perhaps a cave. We must find some shelter. Murat... I'm finished. Kasai, you can't survive without eating! Show some initiative. Please, stop. Please kill me. I can't even Kill myself. Stop talking like that! Get some rest today. That's best. We'll find you food. We'll take care of you. Let's go. Mami. You're alive. Do you have food? Do I look famished? Mami... Please help me. You've got to. So you finally asked me for help. You realize what that means? I'll help you. Come with me. Mushrooms are sprouting all over in the rain. Where is the food? It's not far now. They look gross. Actually, they're so delicious. If you eat this, you'll begin to look like a mushroom. That's why there were no mirrors. But once you eat one, you can't stop. Yoshida! Kasai! Kasai! Kasai! Kasai! Kasai! He's not here. Professor... I'm... I'm... We mustn't give up! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Sakuta! Sakuta! Masafumi Kasai, Kenji Murat, Etsuro Yoshida... ...Senzo Koyama, Mami Sekiguchi and Akiko Soma. These six persons have died. I tried to escape but ran out of food. I'll have to jump overboard. Skipper, Naoyuki Sakuta. Darn it. I found the yacht. The yacht? Has Mr. Sakuta returned? He's probably dead. Only the yacht was washed up. He couldn't escape from this island. Is this all for today? I haven't eaten! Isn't that mushroom edible? If you eat that, you're finished. But... Mami and Kasai... Stop it... They're half mushroom! Does that matter? That may be the only way to live. I'm sorry. I should have known better. You're wonderful and strong. I feel so weak and miserable. I want to die. Akiko... I can't live without you. Professor! This is the last day. We'll gather food until this evening and then leave the island. Professor! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Akiko! Professor! Where are you? Akiko! Professor! Akiko! Akiko... Professor... They're so delicious. Come on! We must escape! Professor! Professor! Professor! And then the night came... I don't know who saved me. But I regret it now. If I really loved her, I should have eaten too and become a mushroom. And lived with her there. Isn't that right? It's be better than being in here. There was so much food! I never took a bite! No matter how hungry we felt, I kept her and myself from eating them! For what purpose? We are grateful that you were able to come back. I wonder. Is it really any different in Tokyo? They're becoming inhuman. Just like there. I would have been happier there. THE END
