This is a story of two best friends and their trustworthy servant. They are innocent, idiotic, and greedy. Moreover, they have a common enemy. He is Gold Belt Appaji. A multi-color moron. The first Indian on the moon... Is me! The man of the century! The man about to create history... Is me! The mark of the first man on the moon! Armstrong's leg is strong too! His footprint is indelible! Right next to it... I will place my right foot and create another print for eternity. Is this your in-laws' house to put your right foot forward? Yes, my maternal uncle's house, My Chandamama's house. Then wait till the next Diwali. While I place my holy foot on... No, this is not a dream. They've landed on the moon! But their journey here had more twists than a snake's tail and more steps than on a ladder. Come, let's descend into the tale, ladies and gentlemen. What's this, Mr. Auditor? A singing event to greet me in my hotel? Sir, our profits are the highest among South Indian hotels. You hold the number one position in all of South India. You are the only one. The one and only, Anjaneya Prasad! Only and lonely. Are they tears of joy? No. They're real tears. I miss him at this happy juncture. My friend and I opened our first hotel. Amrutha Vilas. We slogged day and night for six years. And the balance sheet showed a profit of one rupee. We decided to close the business and leave town. Then we got to know that a big IT company, had given us an annual lunch contract. Our building owner Appaji kept the news from us. He took over our business and gave us two acres of land in exchange. I've been warning you against teaming up with that Anjaneyulu! You've earned half a rupee in six years! That's not even ten paise a year. It's more than eight paise and less than nine. Damn! Counting dismal decimals makes me... A fit? A heart attack? Ammu! This is it! Damn. Hey! Promise me that you'll never meet that monkey Anjaneyulu again! That you'll be a thousand miles away from him. And cut all ties with him. Email, Gmail, SMS, MMS, cellphone, landline, not even messenger pigeons. Swear on this photo! Why are you looking there? Come here. Not a polished face even at a young age. Not there, it's here! You've taken the oath. See. What's there to see? It's your glowing moon face eclipsed by my sweaty palm. Cheating! Didn't you plan to cheat me on the promise because it was my picture? Uncle! Separating us for life is a cosmic cataclysm. Our friendship is as tall as the Qutub Minar. As deep as iron-ore mines! As wide as the Great Wall of China! As red as the Red Fort! As strong as the pyramids of Egypt! His heart is as strong as a boulder. You're not taking a good decision being in a bad mood. If you listen to the news I've got. You'll lift both of us, twirl us around, and kiss us! Cut the hype, give me the news. The Ring Road was realigned and I sold our two acres for 100 crores! You can see it here. Here Amrutham, your share. 50 crores! Oh god! So much money? Let me see! Mom! Fifty crores! - Fifty! - Fifty! - Fifty! - Fifty! What do you say now, dear uncle? Did you see the instant result? The moment you took an oath to stay apart, 50 paise turned to 50 crores! This is unfair, unjust, and uncouth! Staying apart should not last a lifelong! Please retract this petulant pledge at this happy juncture at least. Okay. What was it that you compared the strength of your friendship to? The Pyramids. They have been indestructible for thousands of years. So be it. You need to stay apart for only as long as they exist. Five years have gone by since then. Don't know where he is and how he is. I'm glad you finally have the time to take your wife out. Santha, dear, this is the least I can do for you on Valentine's Day. Okay, what more are you planning to do? Remember how grandly we celebrated this day at Amrutha Vilas? How many people have we encouraged to meet and date, by giving them free dinner coupons? Yes! I'll restart the tradition. I'll gift a coupon at least to one couple! I'll arrange it in a jiffy. Good. Good. - Vijay. - Sir? Tell them that only one table is available and make them sit together. - Go. - Okay, Sir. Excuse me, Sir. This table is reserved. Please sit there. Excuse me. Is that table available? Yes, Madam. Vijay! Sir, sorry. My mistake, it's this table that's reserved. Please you have to sit there. Order, Madam? Mutton Dum Biryani. What about you, Sir? A coffee. Okay, Sir. So he wants to leave early? Okay, delay the coffee. - Coffee. - Coming, Sir. - Coffee. - Coming, Sir. Coffee. Coming, Sir. Hello! Oh! Sorry, sir. 750 rupees for a cup of coffee? A coffee and a biryani, Sir. Why should I pay for the biryani? Oh, separate bills? Sorry. Leave it to me. I'll handle this. Excuse me, this is inexcusable! What did I do? I've been observing you keenly from the moment you entered. Resenting the table, the food order, the bill. Resenting who? Who else? Your girlfriend. - My girlfriend? - Of course. Next, you'll say you don't know her at all. Exactly! Correct, as I guessed it! You tend to take wrong decisions in anger. But when you kiss and make up, you forget those who helped you patch up. Come, pay up now. Why should I pay? Sulk another day. Not today. As a mature, wise, experienced, man, I'm telling you. It's for your good, people are staring. Pay up. Good! This is Valentine's spirit. You are a special couple to me. Show this card here tomorrow, dinner's on the house for the both of you. Happy Valentine's day my unhappy boy! Give this to that Biryani Baby. My bill? Your companion paid for it, Madam. He also left you this free coupon. - My companion? - Yes, Madam. They had turned a lover's day into a tiff day. And I, yes, yours truly, brought about a truce. So let's open these two bottles and say cheers. - No, thank you. - Why? I have two reasons as well. One, I've finished my dinner and dessert. Two, I doubt the couple you strove to bring together was ever separated. They could even be total strangers. You doubt me even after I've become such a successful businessman? Your nature is such. Like a dog's tail. Never straight, at any age. Is he standing asleep or looking askew? Bellboy! Trolley back! Sorry, Old bellboy. Why are you going past me with this heart? Just delivering a gift for the Chairman. Okay. No danger, no cholesterol. Knock the door thrice and enter with your leg. Understood? Understood. His language is always a challenge. Hello Anjaneyulu! How are you? Mr. Appaji! What's this sudden visit for? And this fancy dress? Not fancy, but an emergency dress. For three years that Chennai Express has prevented me from meeting you. Do you mean my PA cum bodyguard, Mr. Sarvesvaran? Yes, the very same Shaneshwaran. Sincere fellow. Anyway, what's the urgency to meet me Mr. Appaji? I wanted to bring you this gift. I went to great lengths and spent a great lot to procure it. How long do you take to deliver a cake? Ah! It's you, Appaji Saarvadu? In disguise and disturbing the peace here? Call the police! Call CRPF! Call the Army! Call the fire station! The CBI as well! Cool down, Sarvam. It's a gift, not a bomb. All orders pending. What! A pocket kerchief and a mop cloth in this heart-shaped box? You wretched rat-catcher! That's not a mop. It's a quality silk stole. A Benaras Blouse piece! - The box is big. - My plea is small. Now the bomb will explode. Alert! You may give me 25 lakh rupees. What's this, a penalty payment? No, just a loyalty endorsement. Another imagined entitlement? It's a matter of fair play and justice. I have taken your Amrutha Vilas and lost heavily. You have taken my Ring Road land and profited immensely. You did not expect that. You anticipated the opposite. So your eyes burnt with envy! Envy and me, Anjaneyulu? When friends succeed in life, my eyes light up! If you don't believe, see the glow of affection in Appaji's benevolent eyes. See! See properly! See! Why did you switch off the lights? Don't you have a backup? Sarvam will lead you. Where are you taking me? To the cashier? Are you giving me cash? Hey! Why are you speeding? To reach the bank before closing time? Speak up in your language at least. Are you paying me or not? Account close, eyes open! We had increased the rent of the house on road number two. Has the amount been credited? - Credited, Father. - That of the house on road ten? All were collected, including the power bill. And the rents from the old building in Ashok Nagar? Two months due, 23 thousand rupees. I'll add a penalty of 2000 and collect 25,000 this evening! What else? The usual for Amrutha Vilas building. Got a notice for the municipal tax. Oh, damn! All because of those two idiots, the house has been jinxed. They struggled as paupers when they lived here. And became multi-millionaires the moment they stepped out. Useless fellows! Not a tenant in sight. That house weighs on my heart like an unmarried daughter. By the way, papa, how is he? Who, dear? Sarvam. Your father is in intensive care. Yet, you show intensive concern for that Sambar Espresso? Your eyes seem to be okay. Go check your accounts. Have to fill up these four years of nil Even if it costs a bit. Yes, Gongali Appaji, tell me. I need your son-in-law's address. Did Anjaneyulu employ you to find out? No. Anjaneyulu and I, don't see eye to eye of late. Then, why do you want it? I want to invite you to my daughter's wedding. Inform him, don't invite him. He should not come South of the Vindhya mountains. A tall fence. Okay, give me his phone number. He doesn't carry a cell phone. Big shots don't carry phones. Their assistants do. Alright, I'll note down the address. Need not write it. Go to Delhi and ask, anyone will point the way to Royal Palace Hotel. At the hotel, anyone can show you who Amrutha Rao is. Wait. I expected him to be the owner, is he the bellboy? I wasted money on my journey here. You move. Can't he at least wangle a meal in his staff quota? Over here, even bellboys feel like owners. He treats every guest as a family member. Carrying luggage in so many languages. Oh! Couldn't keep the Bellboy job for long either, got demoted to a janitor! Good job. You care for this place like your own! Yes, sir. I think this is my hotel, my floor, my mop... My legs, damn! Mr. Appaji! When did you come? A moment before you disinfected my legs. Very happy, Sir. Please sit in the lobby. I'll join you after I get off duty. Get that man with the gold belt inside. The MD is calling you in. I'm leaving though. Let me go. Why are you letting me in instead of letting me out? No, he is calling you. I wasn't cursing your MD. I was talking about the janitor. Go. Mr. MD, those expletives were meant for that pauper Amrutha Rao, not you. Aren't you the MD? No. I'm the PA to MD & Chairman. Then who was that down there? It was a rehearsal for our ad film. Our boss dons the worker's role in all our ads. Why? To dramatically show the hotel's dedication to serving. Who owns this hotel? A banished wanderer. It belongs to a poor guy, who was cheated by a mustached man. You. Yes, I'm that loaded mendicant. You own this palatial hotel? Six hotels. Three in West India, two in East India, and this one. An under-construction casino in Nepal. I thought your money got you a minor share in this property. Didn't expect this success in my worst nightmare! What's your business secret? Not doing business. Elaborate, please. Hey, PA, order some refreshments. My journey started four years back. I came to Delhi and deposited my 50 crore rupees in a bank. To avoid the risk of being mugged at the ATM, I set up net banking with foresight. All purchases and payments were online and I was on cloud nine. One day Sanju asked me to buy her a silver dinner set, like the one at Amar Singh's house. Just 25 kilos of silver, not half her weight! I indulged her and placed an order for five lakh rupees worth of silver. The zero key got into the giving spirit and halted three stops later. 50 crore rupees instead of five hundred grand! All of your money? Got 25 tons of silver instead of 25 kilos. 25 tons? A silver mountain! Not knowing how many plates and forks that would make, I remained blank for one year. Suddenly, the price of silver doubled. I sold it. The fifty crore rupees turned into 100 crore rupees. Even got a dinner set free! If silver got me so much, I guessed gold would profit me even more. Invested all my funds in a piece of land for mining. Near Bellary. But I got to know, ordinary people can buy and wear gold, not mine. Means your billion for bullion turned to dust? Yes, red, dry land that even my tears could not irrigate. But they found iron ore in it. At that time the export market boomed. The money came in truckloads. My income was 100 crore rupees a month. I observed it for six months. Gained 600 crore rupees. Felt it was unwise to poke my finger into a foreign business. And sold it off. Gave up a multi-billion dollar pie because you felt it unwise to put your finger into it? You needn't feel so bad. I sold it for a big profit. Hey! Fire! You idiot, you are fanning the fire! Don't blow, suck on it! Suck on the damn tail, you chimp! The very reason I stopped putting fingers in pies, and bought hotels and stayed put. This is my journey. There are more mishaps than miles covered in your travel. Yes. Many accidents. In accidents, people lose a limb or two. You lost your jinx. And I got it. What are those dark circles around your eyes? Did anyone draw on your face instead of paper? To show affection, I got this affliction. Then why are you wandering up north instead of seeing a doctor? To collect my dues. Your dues? I lost 25 lakhs due to the restaurant I bought from you. Reimburse it. Buy my house for 1,5 crore rupees. I will offer you an installment plan as well! Got a checkbook? You! He's asking for the checkbook. I am asking you. Did you get the checkbook? Do you plan to pay me with my check? You write me a check for two lakh rupees. I'll write one for an equal amount. We'll give both to Jethmalani. Who's this in between? A top lawyer. This will be his consultation fee. If he says your case is sound, I'll pay you not 25, but 125 lakhs. Deal? I'll take your leave. Order a packed dinner for the return journey. The leader of space technology, Rocket Travel Company has come to India. Soon, Moon Tourism would be a reality. The first lift-off will take place from the Launch Center in Andhra Pradesh. On the occasion of the launch of their office in Delhi, the company's MD, Mr. Richard, spoke to the media. He said the reason to set up in India is vast technological resources and limited expenses here. So, they are beating their competitor Ming and Lee in setting up an office. Anjaneyulu and Amrutha have become wise. Together, they dug their own grave. But apart, they are invincible. I got killed! Uncle! It's you! Are you hurt? How can he hit me with a car and call me uncle? Recognized you by the belt. Who are you? It's Chandu, your nephew! Remember, you would impose penalties and confiscate all the pocket money my father gave me in the name of discipline? Ah, yes! How you have grown! Come, I'll see my boss off at the airport and drop you off. Sir, may I? Of course! Get in! Thank you. Uncle, get in. - Hello. - How are you? That is our business, Uncle. Tickets to board a rocket, eh? How much is the commission? Commission? It is not a cheap business. We don't pay commissions. So you call it a concession. Tell him. To fill up seats, you need - to grease some hands. - Uncle! Even insurance companies offer a commission. I'll take the ladder. Throw the dies dear. Ammu! Where are you going? Forgot my toothpick in the office. Ammu! Won't you say hello to my parents who have come down? Oh! Hell... Oh! Ammu! Sorry, Father. It's okay if he doesn't speak to me. My heart keeps overflowing with joy that he has seen success because of me. Yes, dear, the happiness and pride have made him young again. He is rubbing oil all over himself. What, still around? Ammu! Baby, Serve him these. What, mother-in-law, are we celebrating something? Just made something at home. Come Sanju, let's demolish the lot together. No way! I weigh 56 Kg. Dieting for 6 months and have not shed half a kilo! Forget dieting, you need to sweat. Do some remote exercise, and watch TV. The Egyptian government has announced a reward of 500 crore rupees on Sin Laden's head. Added to last year's reward announced by the USA The total prize money for the terrorist is 1,000 crore rupees. Sin Laden went ahead to warn them on Nil Jazeera TV last night. Pharaoh, zero! Free hit! One more cruel attack! Lucky Hasten and climb the ladder of success This combination gives a heart attack Lucky Hasten and climb the ladder of success This combination gives a heart attack We are beneficial for each other Everyone else is useless The ozone layer is our stage for grooving Today unknowingly and Surprisingly we met again We'll never turn back until We answer all questions Lucky Move here, there, and everywhere Do whatever we like cause we can Merge the powers, sign for success This is a historic testament Future plans. International film awards. Bheemavaram Bombers. The boundaries stopping Them are perishing now Sarva! Dear! How are you, dear? How long it's been! Four years, five months, 20 days, 16 hours, 37 minutes. When you were counting the seconds, how could you keep away for so many days? What could I do? I swore an oath as well. Till they don't meet, even we will not meet! What? If they remained separated for life, you would have never seen me again? Never forever! I gathered some left-over LTTE bombs to go to Egypt. To blast those pyramids. Luckily, some noble soul performed that task. You'll even become a terrorist for my sake! Terrorist, Maoist, Capitalist, Journalist, anything for you! Is Uncle Appa in the house or outside? He's inside but in a loop. Crackers will shake up the Earth Extinction of rain will Extinct the oceans Air will get startled and start moving Suddenly the volcanic Eruption should destroy For days he's been rewinding that and regaling himself thus. The land should break into pieces All the five elements of Earth And humanity should go to hell The merger of friends -like this will change the universe -Oh, God! I crave to see this happening Friends and fans, as promised, Anji and I have joined hands again to start a high-flying business, International Airport Hotels! In one stroke, Amrutha Air Vilas Hotels will be opening in New York, London, Dubai, Frankfurt, Sydney, Tokyo, and Singapore! In two minutes, we'll get to the rare, auspicious hour across time zones. At this auspicious hour, they will be in a good mood. As soon they launch it, we will explain our proposal. Okay. That ring is a good omen! Answering it will make it better. - I'll cut it. - Hey, wait. Hello! What? - Please! - Two more minutes. You promised we will cut the ribbon. You want to open something that's already open? Someone in room 302 has ordered coffee! Sarvam! Sarvam! Sarvam! Good morning, Sarvadu! Oppy happening! Dozing off? Someone crept into room 302 without your knowledge? Unfair, sir. I was aware and awake. I waited till 12:01 a.m. and checked them in! And chucked the auspicious hour out of the window? Why? I thought getting a booking on the first minute of the day was holy. Take the guests and open the coffee shop. - Come. - Come. Auspicious bad luck. Let us go. Don't hold back. Go, you run the hotel. Okay. Hello, Good Morning in India! Amrutha Air Vilas speaking. A wedding booking? What can be more auspicious than a wedding? Sir, a wedding Hall, a priest, and a wedding dinner for tonight. For how many? Two. Must be hosts. Yes, two hosts. How many guests? Two. Maybe you dropped three zeroes after two. Who is getting married? Hosts are getting married to the guests. What, host weds guest, you pest! Now I see the full picture! First, the two hosts marry. Then they turn to guests and eat the wedding feast. The guest return to being hosts, pay the bill, and go honeymooning! I'll banish you to outer space! Give me the phone. Hi, this is a senior management person handling your valuable inquiry. The Joint Managing Director of the Joint Venture, Amrutha Air Vil... Hello? Hello?! Disconnected in the past. Fool! You should have taken the name and address first. No need. They stay here, in room 302! 30... The media and the guests are having breakfast. He's checking how many people are getting married. What? Mr. Sameer and Miss B. Doll Reddy from Hyderabad. If they are locals, why did they check in last night for tonight's flight? Something wrong is happening. Excuse me. There was no one at the reception upstairs. About the wedding booking... - Yes. Tell me. - Sir! It's you! - Hi! - You know me? Didn't recognize us? Doll and I were at your restaurant on Valentine's Day. Oh yes! You had a tiff and I helped you patch it up. No tiff, Sir. We met for the first time there. - First time? - Yes, Sir. Yes. Then we kept meeting each other at your hotel. Anji, get a hold of yourself. The love acorn I planted has grown into a wedding oak! I am happy that you are carrying on our Indian Valentine's tradition in my absence. Proud, I'm very proud of you. Sir, is this hotel also yours? Yes, and you are our first guests! Meeting in your hotel and getting married in your hotel is very dramatic! Very romantic. Very cinematic. And fantastic! It's comic sir, most comic. Now, why this secret wedding? Sameer is an orphan. And my family is against this marriage. We'll get married this evening and live in Singapore. But a wedding without guests? Without a family to bless you? We will be your family and friends! Yes. We'll plan a grand ceremony! A delay may cause problems. Why impose on them? They know their problems best. Come problems, come earthquakes. Come worries, come tsunamis! We swear on the earth and sky, we will get you married! SAVE THE WORLD FROM PLASTIC USE CLOTH BAGS Hey! Where's my baby, Barbie Doll? Searching for Toys R Us, I presume? Not Toys R Us, you Brontosaurus! I've come for my daughter, Barbie Doll Reddy. Is Doll's full name Barbie Doll? Let's discuss this amicably. This is amicable enough. Hey, security warning! If you lay your hands on the boss, this bodyguard will take serious action! Like this? I'm only a PA till noon. Then why are you here after 12? Get lost. Oh, god! All ambulances, KIMS, NIMS, Care, Star, Sunshine, and Anu Test Tube Baby Center. - Look... - What will you show? Your name? Pol, Pol Reddy. Lion of Seema. Ah, Sir Lion Pool Reddy. - Not Pool, idiot, Pol Reddy. - Oh, Mr. Pol Reddy. Yes. Let's sit together in a cultured and peaceful... What's this prattle? The marriage begins in five minutes. Ask them to see us after the ceremony. Hush, this is Doll's father. I have no time for this faction lord nonsense. I dismiss this stone-age riffraff! Send these buffoons on their way. Now! This minute! Get out! Okay. You have requested so respectfully, it's only fair to discuss the matter. Open the conference room. Your name? Pol Reddy. What? Just a formality, that a meeting took place. Please sign that. Coal Reddy. Mole Reddy. Hole Reddy? Good guess! Okay. The Board meeting for Sameer and Barbie Doll's impending holy matrimony, is called to order! What meeting, you dolt? We have come to take our baby home. Not against her wishes. She's not a minor. Yes, she's not a minor, but she's our baby. Our only baby. Our grandpa had no sisters or daughters. Our father had no sisters or daughters. We too have no sisters. In our family, there were no females for generations! Don't say your marriage wasn't with females either. Got your point. She's the only girl child for all of us. So we affectionately gave her an English name, Barbie Doll. We carry her statuette with us at all times. Enough banter. Come, Baby, get into our car. What car? Look! Oh! Sorry, wrong picture. That's a movie DVD. Sarvam, switch on the security cameras. Hello. Outside camera two on. Camera four. Leave and you get away with a parking fine. Or else it will lead to a big mess. You think knowing a few traffic constables is great? Want me to call the Task Force? PA, call the Sub Inspector. Hole Reddy, call the Inspector! Call the Assistant Commissioner. Coal, call the Commissioner. Hang it, just call the Director General of Police. Good Morning Mr. DGP. Good Morning Mr. Anjaneyulu! How are you? Fine, but for one minor irritation, one Pol Reddy. That faction leader? Yes, Sir. Hey, Pol Reddy! Do you know who he is? Amudhala Anjaneya Prasad, South India's hotel king! Sir, they are getting my daughter married off against my wishes She'll be happy. You get out from there in two minutes. And leave the city in ten. Let us run! Oh god! I'm coming along, brother. Get out! What happened, dear? Don't say your dad kicked the... - I've gained two kilos after moving here. - Oh! Understandable. It's been a string of homecoming dinners. Ammu! Though the wedding was called off, but you enjoyed the feast last night. Feeling sad? Don't worry, we'll get you married soon. Actually, I'm happy. All this while, I thought my father was invincible. Now I know you are more powerful. So we are neither scared nor anxious. In our presence, all fears vanish! Be ready for another grand and fearless wedding! What do you say Anji? Doubtless! Doubtless! Congratulations, Sir! What's this auditor, another pageant? Surprise! Please come I'll tell you. 2000 in 2013, have we gone back by 13 years? No, your business has zoomed ahead! Because of your merger, your value is up by 300 crore rupees. It is now touching 2000 crore rupees! These worthless fellows are worth 2000 crore rupees? - Yes! - Congrats, Sister. What's your next venture, Sir? Been thinking hard, but no project has struck me as big enough for our status. Don't break your head over it, take a break instead. You've slogged for years. Now go for an extended vacation to the moon. Joking? Are you still making fun of us? Think it's a fable? See, this is Chandra Mohan. - Hello, sir. - RTC. He's an officer in the Rocket Travel Company. Our company is a pioneer in passenger rockets. Ranging from two to 20-seater models. A ticket for a two seater costs about 200 crores per head. Reasonable. A ticket for a 12-seater is 50 crores. Very reasonable. And for a 20-seater, you won't believe it, just 30 crores! Oh, subsidy rocket. Yes, for billionaires like you, it's just a picnic. Chandra Mohan, - book four tickets right away! - Hold on! Middle-class people like you are excited by picnics and holidays. Business magnates are ever thinking of investment and work. - And work. - And work. Every minute, our brains are churning out plans for business development. So true! No time for pastimes. It is not good to be a workaholic. Appaji! Don't club them with common tourists! They are industrious industrialists who believe in laborious labor. They think with the depth of the brain, see with the breadth of vision, and work with the sweat of the brow! Sorry, sirs, Mr. Appaji lacks your foresight. Going to the moon isn't a pleasure trip. It's a business opportunity! Do you mean going to the moon is a business? Most certainly, damn definitely! An out-of-the-world chance! You know once you start, tourists will line up like ants. To crawl to the moon? Yes. And won't those tourists need food and accommodation? They will! Vast moonlit Resorts, Earth-lit Resorts. Yes! An added attraction, those who land first can occupy as much land as they want! - This is a golden opportunity. - Yeah! No, silver, no, platinum opportunity! I'll take it! Ya! You blew it! We come to sell a few tickets and you try to hawk the moon itself. Now we have hurt our chances. Don't be impetuous. If we fall from that height, we are buried. Think for a minute. I've thought nine times in a nanosecond. You know my processing speed. Cost of a ticket for a rocket? 30 crore rupees. Ticket for a train? 800 rupees. Train passengers happily buy a plate of idli for 20 rupees. In the same ratio, rocket travelers should buy idlis for 75 lakh rupees without a murmur. One plate idli for 75 lakh rupees! Yes, and dosa for twice the price. We'll give condiments free of cost. Appaji will have to sell a house for every dosa he eats. Decent profit. Okay! Okay, give me a firm quote for five return tickets, multiple trips for raw materials, - A goods rocket. Give me the total figure. - Okay. I'll tell you in a minute. Sir, the grand total is 2013 crore rupees. As a first customer discount, I'm rounding it off to 2000 crore rupees. 2000 cror... Your commission is two crores. On this investment, what turnover should we make? Just 1000 idlis and 834 dosas, and we break even! - Yeah. - Okay, get the agreement readied. Yes, sure! Your contract worth 2000 crores is ready to be signed. 2000 crores? Our entire property. Including every last penny. So mid-term elections are on due to this strong opposition. Enough! We need to take a decision now. Those in favor of it, SMS "Y" space moon and those against it, "N" space moon. It's a tie. Chandramohan has come to us with a special offer. We'll hear him out. And do a re-poll. Will I get my commission today? No. The moment their rocket lifts off, the amount will drop down into your account. What's your final offer? Buy one, get one. For the five tickets you buy, we give you another five tickets, free! Ten people can travel. I doubt if my parents can travel that far. Even if they can, I refuse. Carrying two grizzlies would prove to be more useful. Think well. In just a day you can occupy more land than you can dream of. Will you supply big tractors? Such engines won't work there. But you can cover great distances on foot itself. One stride on the moon can be equal to a big leap on Earth. Because of low gravitational force, So, your weight becomes 1/6th but your strength remains the same. If you weigh 60 kilos here, you will be a mere 10 kilos there. Even if I hog all day, just ten or 12 kilos! Good news! August 14th has been selected for Doll and Sameer's wedding. Bad news! Not just the business, we had to sell the houses and cars to clear the check. All our jewelry too, except one a piece. See, you've started reducing already! Just over a crore is left in the account. I have good news for you. Your launch date is fixed. August 15. You will train at our center till then. Lucky dates! Doll and Sameer get married on the 14th. And honeymoon on the moon, the next day. Yeah. Your Moon Card, the world's most valuable debit card. Value is 2000 crores. Use it for all your purchases at RTC. What will you do with that small change in your bank? Buy my house, I'll offer it to you in installments. Whenever you come down to Earth, you'll save on rent. It's your lucky house too. You'll save your sentiments and rent. - No! - No! Yes! You pour billions into empty space. But balk at purchasing something concrete. Buy it! Okay. What's this installment business, when we are paying in full? That's an old agreement. No worries, I'll give you a receipt for full payment. Santha always gets her way. Shock in the business world as hotel kings sell their total stake. As they haven't invested elsewhere, rumors floating around suggest bankruptcy. A. VISHWESHWAR RAO STATE HOME MINISTER With the DGP's support, they kidnapped my daughter. Can't be. They are respectable and rich. Even donate liberally to the party fund. Now they'll ask for a refund. They sold off everything. Order the DGP to get my daughter back. Okay, I'll speak to him. Congratulations! You've trained better than Olympic athletes. Go, complete the wedding rituals and be back early the day after. We'll take the suits with us. So that even if the ceremony goes on late, we can be at the gate fully dressed. Rocket lift-off is at 11 hours, 11 minutes, and 11 seconds. Yes! All ones! Lucky number. Let's go and celebrate a grand gala wedding! Dump the pomp, and make it a quiet affair this time. Santha, then who'll see our saris and jewelry? Have they left us that many now? All I ask is a modicum of sense. Silence, My golden Santha! You shall see a silent wedding. You seem to ignore my instructions, DGP. No, Sir. We were unable to locate them. They sold off their house as well. Ask Mr. Pol Reddy, we searched all over the city. No excuses. I want the girl found. I'll inform you the moment I know their address. Thanks, Mr. Naidu. We will hand over the house tomorrow. Superb! Is the bride ready? Are the remaining arrangements done? Silent prayers, a silent saint, and silent music as ordered by Anji. I've arranged for a few things with my foresight. What did you do in extra? I invited DGP for extra safety. That too with a silent SMS. So no obstructions for the wedding. Come. No sign of activity, is this the marriage place? Yes. Where's the pandal? Sir, we are musicians. Do we sit to the right or left of the pandal? Shush! Not right, not left, but under. Follow instructions, batteries included. What's this, like a chicken coop? Yes, cluck away happily. Such a pain in this old age. Hello! Mic testing! One, two, three! I can hear clearly, who is speaking? Stupid! Sharma sir, this is me Anjaneyulu. What are these weird arrangements? A wedding revolution! Without sound pollution. Okay, starting the rituals. Keep sprinkling the rice grains, son. As you say. Not you, Anjaneyulu. The groom. Sprinkle the sacred rice grains. Greetings, Priest! It's me, Amrutha Rao. Greetings! - Say "ma ma", son. - "Ma ma". Not you Amrutham, the groom. This message is for Sharma sir. Please name the person your instructions are for. Done. These invocations are for God. Call the bride. Now hold the veil between the groom and bride. Forgot to get the veil. - Okay, we are holding it. - What are you holding? A handkerchief. Couldn't you get a stole? It would spoil the look. Doll close your eyes so as not to see him. All of us will also do so for support. What's up? Marriage. Whose? An orphan and the daughter of that demented Pol Reddy. Ah, Pol Reddy's daughter? Correct. Father! Wondering how I landed here without an invite? Your friend, the DGP, he informed me. Didn't come empty-handed though. Got some explosive gifts. Get ready for placing cumin and jaggery on the heads. Forgot that as well? I can't hear you at all. Then place something on the heads. Ammu! Leave! Or else lose your daughter! That movie played in our town as well! Wrong turn. Hey! Stop your noise and lift this up! Why is everyone silent? This is the most sacred moment. I'll come and supervise it in person. I don't know what you're all doing. Don't worry. What! A mass wedding? You are paying me for performing only one. Stop doing that! Circumambulation in reverse is equal to divorce. No word, no offering! Something is wrong. Is this fair? You have no respect for me. Want an offering? Here. This is respect. What's this, a fruit or a sweet? Pulp. Something that will turn you into a pulp. A bomb. Bom... A bomb?! Catch hold of them! Brother, I can't catch hold of them. Why are you scratching my head? Did you find them? Brother, I'm coal. Firstly, you're invisible. Why are you grooving in the dark? Escaped the goons with the help Of priests and reached the RTC. Goodbye to all the goons! Let's fly! Who are you? The first passengers of the RTC rocket. Open the gates. Sorry, the company has been shut down. Go call Chandramohan! All the employees have been sacked. There's a lockout. Hey Anji! Don't struggle too much We are swimming in a spoonful of sea Current bills and Rents are our problems Tears are out due to extra spice Fighting with mosquitoes All night is our own deed Don't hasten and feel tense Oh full moon Come down And fill my pockets with 20 crores. Chandramohan will call me. Send him in, pronto! Get papers ready for the five-acre land. - I'll give the payment tomorrow. - Sir, some things are coming this way. - Things? - Yes, sir. Do you mean animals or trees? Pests or diseases? Can't make out, Sir. See for yourself. You all? Did you fall off the rocket or diverted it here? What rocket? The company itself has disappeared! It's our loss. 2000 crores. Gone away, in a puff of smoke. Two thousand crores! He swallowed it whole. At least if you had given it to me... You would have nibbled at it? No, I would have banked it for you. Even at three percent interest, I would've given you five crores a month. He devoured the total amount. Not all of it. We gave you over a crore for the house. We've come here to take possession of the house. Yes. Sure! But how sly of Chandramohan! He must have known of RTC's problems. That's why he insisted on keeping everything a secret, till the lift-off and then giving us a media blast. He blasted us and left behind the ashes. Were you aware of it as well? Yes, wasn't it you who introduced him to us? So what? Haven't I suffered a loss too? You lost money? Yes, I mean my credibility and my goodwill. All I'm responsible for is the money I took for the house. Come. This is bad. We are feeling low and you want to play hopscotch? Not a game, this is your portion this month. I said I'll give the house on an installment plan. But we paid in full! Yes, the place, though, will be given in parts. Six square yards a month. Ridiculous! If we buy a car in installments, will you hand over a wheel a month? Why talk of wheels when you are on skids? It was clearly mentioned in the agreement, you didn't read it? Six feet to be buried in, six yards to live on. Ah! Time for take-off! Squatters! Encroachers! Occupiers! What, Sir? This is a walkway, a common area. Even stations and bus stands are common and public areas. Will the law allow you to sleep there? This borders on assault! It's crossing bounds. To make it clear, I brought a boundary. What's this? A fence for ducks? Exactly, a duck wall! You shouldn't cross it, unless you wanna use the servant's toilet. Okay. We won't. Please leave, bad night. First pay a trespassing fine, of 100 rupees per head. Trespassing? I just passed by once. Explain the difference between pass and trespass to that idiot! Good morning, Amrutha Rao! Here's your coffee. I decided to give you the house after looking at your plight last night. - Take this. - Newspaper? The master bedroom... for 7000. The second bedroom... for 6,000. The living room... for 9,000. To use the total compound to run a restaurant, 30,000. What are these numbers? Monthly rentals. In rupees. And for the toilets, 3,000 per commode. - And just 2,000 for the showers. - Enough! The smell of coffee fooled us into thinking that you were human after all. Oh, I exude kindness for humans. But I demand hard cash for the building. Pay rent for the house we own? Pay tax for our own sweat? Who are you, the government? You cross the duck wall, and you will be Peking Duck! Yes! A golden egg of an idea! Santha, Sanjeevini, give me your gold. Right away I'll start our business, without paying rent! Gold becomes an egg. Hey, auto! Where do you want to go, Sir? Will you come to Shamshabad? - Get in. - Okay. - Come. - Hey! Why are you leaving on the sly? Enough, Sir. We have brought you enough problems. And a lot of danger. My father and my uncles will hunt you now. Our heads don't bow down to swords! We keep our promise of protection, in love or war! UNKNOWN AMRUT VILAS Have they given their kaftan-sized site to these Afghans and emigrated? Who... are... you? You, go to Goa. Sarvadu, lift it. Sarvadu? So it is you, Afghanadu? Such a shameless act! What's this disgusting disguise for? To cover the shame of our fall. You never soared above the ditch, except these four years. Anyway, good you decided to start your true trade, By accepting my terms. That's a good decision. You pay property tax though I collect rent. Building's in your name, remember? Here's a copy of the rental agreement. Why are you so dumb? What on earth's this, table mountain? From now on you pay us, every time you eat our dosa. On any floor. After paying the money. Even if it's free, who'll climb that high to eat? Hey, cheapskate! Prepaid. Connection. Come in! - Mr. Lawyer. - Hey! It's me, Anjaneyulu. You! In this garb? Some circumstances circumvented our hopes. You have to see to it that justice is done. File two cases in the fast-track court. What's the problem? One is the moon. The other is the effect of Saturn. Okay, done. DON'T CUT FORESTS Hope a good omen comes in as the first customer. Oh, no! This is the last customer we want. It's for these militants, we got this Kabuli protection. We'll stay calm. Sir! It is locked. - Left! - Left! Where's Anjaneyulu? Do you know what's available? We have idli, upma, puri, dosa. Shut up! What's your name? - Yahya Khan! - Mine's Wah Wah Khan! I'm asking you again, where's Anjaneyulu? Do you know, Wah Wah? I do not know, Yahya. Then who knows, Wah Wah? Allah should, Yahya. Don't Wah Wah me, Yahya! We know this house belongs to them. You work for them, right? Wait! Who are you? Allud Khan. - Allud Khan? - Allaudin Khan. In short, we call him Allud. - What do you call him? - Putri Khan. Putri khan? First, keep those knives away. Without knowing where Amrutham and Anjaneyulu are, we will not budge. A gulab jamun for my brother and a masala dosa for me. - Parcel? - A gulab jamun for my brother... Cut his throat, and he'll open his mouth. I'll tell you! I will tell you where they all are. Where are they hiding? On the moon. - Where? - They flew off to the moon. You dumb Allaudin, don't rub my lamp the wrong way! Think with your brains, not swords. They received 2000 crores in cash. Will anyone splurge that to start this measly restaurant? Will anyone on Earth turn from prince to pauper in seconds? With that money, they purchased tickets for a rocket and left for the moon. They leased this building to us. They gave this to us as a memory. My child! Lovely girl! Baby Doll, have you gone beyond our reach? Put these swords in the bag. - We are free! - And disguise-free as well! Yahya! Wah Wah! Yahoo! See! Commercial place in the morning and a resting place at night. Thief! Catch him! Thief! We need to catch your throat! - Sarvadu? - Go and find some cheap lodging. If you snore here, the snack tower will collapse like a house of cards. FOLDING BED AVAILABLE ON RENT Why waste money on a bed? Uma Devi? Oh, Moonlight Girl! Don't boil me like gravy Oh, dark, handsome male! Don't melt me away like an ice cream Billionaires who didn't accept dowry. Your smile is like the eminence of the moon The day you play hide and seek Is the lunar eclipse day I'll door delivery myself every day Hey send a plate of idlis to the first floor. Oh, my table mountain Give me a solid profit Three dosas and six idlis Be good all the time Our business should shoot up Our past glory should be back Give a sales graph which Escalates out of the sky Oh, death music Instead be our wedding music For how many days we should be apart? When will we cross all the obstacles? Moonlight won't radiate Till we get married Sarvadu we need more flowers. Oh, thorn! Don't come in the way, we are busy with wedding arrangements. Wedding? I will not allow it as long as I breathe! Why should you breathe fire? Do you know them? Oh, it's them who are getting married? Yes, I always wondered, who are they? Are they your relatives? None of your business. Bye. - Who are... - You go, Sir. -Your talents and your love are amazing -Your talents and your love are amazing -This is all your emotional torture -This is all your emotional torture Anjaneyulu, I forgot to wish you the last time. - Good Morning! - Good! I will come up. I want to wish the bridal couple as well. Good... Do you have a pass? What pass? The invite to the ceremony. For a month you trample all over my terrace without permission, and you ask me for a pass? You pustule! In elite ceremonies, you are not allowed in without a pass. Remove it. They are toying with me! I know what's happening behind my back. I'll see! Appaji will not rest. The more we hide, the more curious he gets. If he finds out her father is Pol Reddy, he'll broadcast the information. Idea! Let's reverse the information. Amrutham! Amrutham! - Oh, it's you? - Yes, me. And sleeping next to me is my wife. Who are you, moral police? Okay. Can't sleep a wink not knowing who that couple is. Theirs's is a love marriage. The girl is an orphan and the boy's father is against it. Why, is he super rich? No, a hyper-factionist. Factionist? Locally we say that, but internationally they call him a terrorist. International terrorist! Who? Who's world-renowned? You don't say! Sin Laden? Yes, exactly him! You guys are not normal! You dip your hands in RDX and play with fire Dear Sin Laden, I'm Mr. Appaji. I know where your son is. They are secretly getting him married. If you respond with a gift, I will correspond with his Google map location. At least this way, I'll get a fraction of the money I lost in the moon debacle. My sister is getting married tomorrow, you should come. My brother is getting married at the same time, you should come as well. - I'll come for sure. - See you. Let us give the first invite to the temple. So that we won't face any obstacles. Oh, Lord! Please arrange for my wedding to happen soon. Oh, God! You prepare such a feast and don't invite me? ELEPHANT LAXATIVE Eat! Tomorrow, the marriage altar will be the commode. Welcome to Gemini news. Headlines first. Renowned companies shutting down is making investors tremble with fear. Amrutha Rao and Anjaneyulu are two victims of this. Baby, you have gone far, far away! Leaving me forlorn. Are you hungry? Do you want milk? Have it, baby. - My golden lass. - Brother! Our child hasn't gone to the moon! RTC took the hoteliers' money and vanished. Saw it in the news. All of them are in Hyderabad. What are you waiting for? Load the SUVs with bombs. Let's go! Okay, Brother. The bathroom is safer than the house. A laxative is stronger than an explosion. This is Akashvani News Network. Local news is read by Bejawada Babu Rao. The main headlines are as follows. Two members fight in the State Legislative Assembly Rocket Transport Company, an MNC, took 2000 crores from two hoteliers, and shut down its operations. Anjaneyulu and Amrutha Rao, have filed a case against RTC. We escaped with our lives. But how do we keep body and soul together? six, seven, eight, nine, ten... Fourteen and fifteen. Enough. Sir, I need work as well! - Today I need only 15 laborers. - I know. Please, recruit him as well. Please. I said it's not necessary. Sir, if we don't work, we won't eat anything! Sarvadu! I can't see you in this state. Please, take my place. Please, take it. Very affectionate fellow. He acts as if he sacrificed his knighthood for you. The income will be the same, irrespective of which two go out of three. One small... - Hey! - Yes? Did you weave only three baskets all day? What will you earn at this pace? Here are 30 rupees. From tomorrow we'll try to weave two each. Okay, ten rupees for each one. Will give you the material tomorrow. Sanju, why are you laboring while we're here? Here's our pay. 150 rupees each. We'll bring you happiness with these hands that carried bricks. Soon, we'll move to a two-bedroom flat. They are giving you the flat for carrying bricks? He means, we shall labor day and night, but we can't see you working here. What happened to him again? Give me my money, I'll get going. Santha, give us 200 out of the 300 we gave you. - Why? - We got massages for the muscle burn. We wanted to give the money by your hands. 130 rupees! For six people to eat three meals. Why only six? Where's Sameer? Haven't seen him since morning. May he is hiding, scared that your father may plan another attack. No fear, except our lawyer, no one knows our address. Wherever Sameer is, we will find him, your love will win. How did you earn in 10 minutes what took us all day of back-breaking work? ATM is quick, Sir! ATM? Whose account did you pilfer? My account. I have 60,000 rupees left. Why didn't you say that when we were going to work? Thought you might feel ashamed of taking the servant's money. Shame! And you thought carrying sand and bricks was royal? Didn't think your situation was this bad. All because of you, we are on the street. What did I do Mr.Anjaneyulu? You leaked the matter of us filing a case against RTC to the media. Pol Reddy saw it and attacked us last night. Sorry, but if the case wasn't publicized would RTC have come for a compromise? RTC was taken over by Ming & Lee. As an out-of-court settlement, they have given us a money-back offer! Yes! Now, you're richer than me Sarvadu. Will you take the moon trip or take the 2000 crore refund? What's there to think? As planned we will go... Nowhere! Ask them to refund the money. Don't be silly. Haven't we gone through all this to conquer the moon? I don't concur. You can go. Haven't we suffered enough? This is stupid! If a train is canceled, won't you take the next one? Will you cancel the journey itself? Okay, we'll take the next train. The Moon Trunk Express. Lawyer, please have my 1000 crores returned. Confirm the trip for me! You can't split it. Decide on one thing. Oh, voting? No need, you'll win. Intelligent people are always a minority. Ask for a total refund. Good! Be patient for a week, you'll get your check for 2000 crores. Why wait here, we'll stay in my old hotel. My old hotel! Welcome, Sir. Grand welcome. - Hi, Sir. - Hi, Sir. Your suites are ready, Sir. Dad, listen to me. I never respected you. Now I despise you. - Why are you after me still? - Let's buy the jewelry - Why are you trying to convince me? - after the check clears. - Is this not enough? - We'll call for Pearls! Actually, let's get the Kohinoor! I'm living peacefully by thinking I've got no one. Sameer's voice? I'm not like your dumb students from school blindly following your spiel as the holy word. Oh, but he's not an orphan. He has a father. Traditionalist, A teacher. Stop it! Because I don't believe in your madness... No problem. I'm here! Look, Mr. Teacher, they are not primary school children. They are young adults. Don't worry Sameer. Our full power is back. We can kick Pol Reddy around like a football if we like. Your father is nothing. Answer me, staid Mr. Teacher. Who is addressing me? Who? I'm the Who's Who of supporting your son, Mr. So So. Planning to bolt again? Look at Doll. How miserable she's been since you left! Saw that schoolmaster? That is love. Anyway, which school do you work in? I don't work in a school. I run many training schools. Oh, one of those dreary, cramming institutes for entrance exams? Don't turn everyone into old fogies like you. Like other useless fellows. Useless fellow. Learn to move ahead with the times. Don't blackmail the youth emotionally with laments of caste and community. Theirs is a true emotion. Yours is sly aggression. Your mother will burn herself? Yes? Don't use his weakness as power. Yes, I'll consume pesticides and die, and all of that nonsense. How long will you hold future generations hostage with these threats? Normally, I'm a soft-natured soul. But if I get annoyed, the discussion ends. And the demolition begins. And if my friend Anjaneyulu hears about this, he will incinerate you! He has an ultra-short fuse. Who, the one facing me? Yes, he's not one, he's a hundred! A whole army rolled into one. I'm holding him back. Else, he would have de-boned you through broadband itself! After staring wide-eyed at that tiger, take a look at this lion king! You should have asked Sameer's full name. Sameer Son Laden! Free Hit! Sorry, wrong number. That Sin Laden's gang has blackened the house with bombs! Bombed it? How are you connected with those terrorists? It was I that informed the ace terrorist that his son was at Amrutha Vilas. They even gave me a reward of 10 lakhs. Oh, no! Father, how can you stoop so low to play with people's lives? Thought they'll rap his knuckles and take him away... If we stay with you, your sins will ruin us as well. Come. Sarvam. Why did you lie that you were an orphan? I never agreed with my father's extremism. That's why I had run away from home and lived like an orphan. You ran away from me as well. Staying with all of you would have put your lives at risk as well. Even if you go far, death will always be near my master. Now their faces are printed on your father's Facebook. That's why we have to be somewhere we can't be spotted. Where, the Himalayas or the deep ocean? The moon! Lawyer, a revision! Instead of the money refund, we'll take the moon trip. You cheat! Now I understand your nefarious design! All this was to drag us to the moon! You are blabbering in shock. Was it me who abused Sin Laden? You did not stop me even after seeing him. Instead, you instigated me with your dumb miming! Even if those terrorists and factionists pardon you, this friendist won't! This is how terrorism and greed landed them on the moon. With full fever in bonus. Yay! I weigh ten kilos only! Ten kilos, not ten grams. No? Yay! This lunar land is my golden opportunity. I should have been born here. Me too. I would have been spared from the trouble on Earth. Never dreamed that this would come true! That I would see such a sight! Can't believe that all of us are standing on the moon. We came together. But now we stand separated. Yes, from now on, our lives are separate, and our businesses are separate! Those with that hemisphere go there, those with this hemisphere come here. That's simple, your wife's with you, my wife's with me. Sameer and Sarvam are with me. Doll's with Sameer. Uma's with Sarvam, and Lakshmi's with Uma. What's this? Why don't we stay together? Impossible! The battle on Earth has escalated into full-blown star wars! Even Krishna and Arjuna could not avoid a battle. With my arrow, I'll make your head fly like a sparrow! Please, brother. Having escaped faction fights at home, why start them here? They have a new mania each season. Don't interfere. Leave that madman. - Madman? - Sarvam, - follow me. - Did you see that? What, switched parties? Down there, I worked in the south, Sarvadu. I'll toil in the north up here. Don't feel bad. Next time you guys separate, I'll join you! Engineer! Mr. Engineer! Mr. Engineer? Mr. Engineer! Yes. At your service. Tell me. Did you set foot on the moon before this? No, the first time. Like you. Then why aren't you jumping around in wonder? What's so strange? It's like Earth. You have to slog there, you have to slog here as well. What, you find no difference? I do. There's oxygen there. None here. There's poison gas, politics there. None here. Unless you two start producing it. Greetings to Sarvadu. Good, thought you're down with jet lag. Such discipline is required for a farmer! Who's that, Sarvadu? Us! Now on, we are tillers of the soil! - Come. - Where to, Sarvadu? What does a farmer need? - Free power. - No. If you get it at regular timings it's enough. Need not be free. What is most needed? Maximum, minimum support price! No. If we can sell it to anyone anywhere it will do. Don't divert me with your stupid answers. What a farmer needs is land! You are right, Master. So, let's immediately go down. - Collect some acres... - Roll them up and cart them here? Must have used that to manufacture your brain. Acres of dry land. Useless fellow. All that is land, is moon land. Let's mark it according to this plan. Two kilometers in the west, Three kilometers in the south, two kilometers in the north and three kilometers in the east. Let's occupy as much of it as possible before Anji wakes up. Great idea, Sarvadu. Maybe, Anji thought of the same. Saw him going this way. Idiot! Why didn't you tell me that instead of tying yourself in knots? Follow me. Patent of Anjipatnam! Quit Amruthabad. Quit Anjipatnam. - Quit Amruthabad! - Quit Anjipatnam! - Quit Anji... - Quit Amruth... - Anjipatnam! - Amruthabad is mine. Anjipatnam! Anjipatnam is mine! We are here, move on. Sarvadu, surge ahead! Left, Right, Left, Right! At least the center? Ammu. Ammu? What happened to him? Hello, 108, emergency ambulance? Hello, Mooney number five. The number 108 exists on Earth. Here, I'm the Engineer, and I'm the doctor as well. I'm the Fire Engine, I'm the Ambulance! State your problem. My masters are stuck in their suits. No movement. Not a sound. They have turned to statues. One like Ambedkar, one like NTR. How long have they been in the spacesuits? Since six this morning. That long! I'll be there immediately. Carry them to the quarters right away. Procedure commence! Procedure commence! Why use two ICUs? Put them in one ward temporarily. Froze mid-stride like a toy whose battery ran down. So sad. - What's this? - Power water! Battery Boost? Isn't it because of the low battery that you got sick? Take me where power is at full blast. Take me to the electric crematorium. Good evening, Moon landers! Welcome to FM TV .29, .92, pointless. You missed our free morning broadcast due to which you've encountered some problems. You need to follow a dress code for these spacesuits. How long is the power cut in our state? Six hours. Good girl! These also should be worn for exactly that long. Every six hours, the oxygen should be refilled, and the batteries should be recharged. If it's only six hours, how much land can we occupy? Only as much as you can in one shift, no matter how many days you work. Can we carry batteries? Sure. How many can one carry on foot? Tell that to this idiot. Probably the morning walk didn't exert him enough. Yes! A problem has a solution, and a solution has Anji! Order a cart and two oxen by courier rocket. Add-on, another pair of oxen, and a cart. One plow. Add-on, one more plow. Also, a cow for fresh milk. A calf. How will the cow give milk without it? This buffalo has a vast knowledge of cattle. A year's supply of hay for the cattle. Add-on hay. So both of you need hay chew. Okay. Brimming with ideas. But ordering an electric car doesn't strike them. Hey! Uncle, what's this sudden appearance for? Where did you disappear? Ousted from the old company and posted in the new one. With so much struggle. Lift? To Nellore or Sullurpet? To the moon. A lift all the way there? Thought some itinerant rocket might pick me up. So you want to flag one down like you would a truck on the highway? If you gave me my commission, I'd buy my own ticket. What commission? The company doesn't exist anymore. And even if you buy a ticket we don't have the right to send you up. Till the first occupiers give permission. That's the agreement. It is an early morning on the moon It's a refreshing day With our enliven cow milk Man you're so innocent Man, you don't know The protocol of the moon Dear Anji, Brother it is time to sow seeds Your miseries will vanish, brother Dear Anji brother plow all the way Work hard! Your seeds will flourish The moon land has become your land Move on! It'll grow if you plow And sow all night Where are the pests For your agriculture? You need to work your muscles hard We never need to turn back We don't need to turn back, We turned an impossible thing possible. Dear Anji brother it Is time to sow seeds Let us feed the Earth, come on! Pouring all your mineral water into the minerals? Yes! You'll wither away before a shoot springs up. First, use those bullock carts to occupy land and register it in my office. While they are busy in land-grabbing the young couple grab each other. Anji is scandalized. My children! Immersed in business development, we neglected our moral responsibilities! We should get you married right away. Come, let us watch our wedding video. Sarvadu! The first wedding on the moon is taking place in their colony. Mr. Engineer! Come and take your weekly rations. No, parcel one priest for the marriage. Okay. Add-on a priest. One mangalsutra. One more mangalsutra. Two garlands. Repeat it! Two holy threads. Repeat! Two cumin-jaggery. Repeat! One star. Repeat! Box Anji's ears! Repeat... All you do is imitate me! Yet you call yourself a great innovator. Yes, I am. Did you ever get a single idea? Have you ever achieved anything on your own? N... Headlines are over. Why, isn't this marriage our responsibility? What's wrong if they live together for a year? Santha! Injecting Western perversion into our Indian culture? What would society think of us? You see a society in this vacuum? This is neither East nor West. Not even that planet! If you are so particular, you can register their marriage at the engineer's office as you did for the land. Think I should cancel the order? You rush to splurge but hesitate at saving. Hello, Mr. Engineer. These people will be the same on the silver screen as well! Please contact us during working hours. This is a recorded message. Please contact us during office hours. Long live the Queen. Thank you! Please contact us during office hours. Victory to thee! Why is there no excitement Sanju? That is because, There is no celebration, no silk sarees, and no jewelry. Even if I had them, neither guests nor relatives to see them. Yes! You reminded me of it! I'll celebrate it in a much grander and more original manner than Anji. I'll give you a big fat space wedding! Mr. Engineer, now... I'm off duty now. If you want to say something, you may leave a message after the beep. - What I mean is... - Not the censor's beep but the cell phone's beep. There were a lot of passengers waiting to come to the moon, right? I permit them to travel for their trip. If they buy tickets, they are welcome. Awesome! This surpasses all wonders in fairy tales and myths. By eloping to the moon, my daughter is telling me something. I never dreamed of seeing it in my life. Why would you see it? You wouldn't have even seen a movie with your own ticket. Why quibble about travel costs when the kids' futures are involved? You both have bought my ticket for informing you of your children's whereabouts. Look at him, like an uncomplaining saint. Caution. Enter the security access code. What, a check post here as well? No, a toll gate. A toll in space? Yes, need to pay a toll for the ozone hole. How much? Wait! Give me this pleasure. Charge us for a two-way trip. Oh, forgot we crossed India. Here's a dollar. Found it on the road yesterday, today I'll put it to use. Stop playing with pennies. Look at that rate list. Eight lakh rupees? This is scalping! Drinks? Chilled drinks! - Uncle? - Yes. Here, give me one. No, you'll say it costs 10,000 rupees. Wrong guess. It's free! Free? Then why scrimp, pass the whole crate. Okay. Take the cola Take the cola Take the cola. Enjoy the life like a king You're born and grown You're born and grown Up to enjoy like a king! To enjoy like a king! Cannot pour it. Suck it. What's it? Number one or two? Thumbs up earlier and little finger down now? One lakh rupees for one. One lakh? Exactly. This is unfair. You trapped me with free drinks. One lakh for peeing is unheard of. I've never heard of such bullshit. You've heard of Water Tax? Well, this is Pee Tax. I don't need your space loo. Open the rocket door. I'll pee in open space. Get your helmet. While Appaji was peeing in space, the priest landed on the moon. Tinker, tailor, soldier, sailor, rich-man, poor-man, beggar-man, - thief! - You're a thief! One, two, three, four, ten! Thirty, forty, hundred! Come hither, priestly porter. Come here! I'll wallop you! Called me a porter, as I help in carrying the wedding seats? - You dimwit! - You dimwit? Mr. Priest! Do not curse him, here's the groom. You came alone? We ordered for two marriages. I missed out on the fee for the last marriage. So I'll perform both marriages - at a time. - Okay. Greetings Mr. Sharma! - Greetings. - Take some rest inside while we get the pandal ready. Okay. Move. - Mr. Sharma! What are you doing? - Mr. Priest! You can see what I'm doing. Removing the helmet and shoes to wash my feet before going in. Then that will be the last time you'll wash your legs. Then we'll have to perform your last rites. You cannot survive one moment without them here. This suit is sealed. Even air can't escape. But I've opened a special valve for you to pee. What's this? Lifeline. So that you won't drift away. How much? Just 40,000 rupees. 40,000 for a tape, you worm! I do not need it. It's dangerous if you fall behind. I know physics well. I'm traveling at the same speed as the rocket. Your strong suit is finance, not physics, Uncle! It is alright. Carry on! The space is filled with my water The sound it makes is resonating The flow of the water hastened up It is flowing like a sacred river Is my song worthy of a whistle? How did I end up here? Your spout in front propelled you to the back. How do I get back? You know physics. Turn around and sing your way back here. To the right! A bit more. Right! Push, Uncle! Just like that! Push! That is it! Push! Hold my hand! Come near. - Hand. - Give it. At least this hand! I can't reach it, uncle. Almost there. Push it harder. One final push! Hey! Uncle! Why did you do that? How can I know? It just escaped! Okay, take the cable now. You can pay later. No. Throw me a few soft drinks. I'll drink and try to get back via my own stream. Why this recycling hassle? You have a spacesuit. I do. That's why I can wander in a vacuum. It has oxygen, it has AC. It also has a diaper! Hey, the feet-washing ceremony is at hand. Now the brides' parents will wash the groom's feet. My veil. Oh, your veil. Welcome to the first wedding on the moon. Arrived just in time with gifts. Look how pretty you all are. All look alike! It's time for the auspicious cumin-jaggery ceremony. Stop. Stalled again? Wait for our guests. Ours is a grand, gala wedding. Guests here? Don't say your relatives are stuck at the traffic lights. You carry on, Mr. Sharma. There they are! Come, Sanju, let us welcome our interplanetary guests. Thanks for accepting our invitation. Don't go back without having dinner. - Come, please. - Come. Our wedding is on that side. This is a local marriage. A helmet change? Why, have you become dark and lovely? Feeling shy? Okay, put the cumin-jaggery here. Not the cummin-jaggery, I'll put ginger in your eyes. Oh! A bear! This is so magical! Who are you? Your near and dear one. Mr. Pol Reddy! Bomber Poll reddy! How can you link Afghanistan and Ananthapur? You moron! Hey, Barbie Doll Reddy! Let's go. Stop! It's not civilized to stop a wedding. Hey Kafir! You idli fakir! Shut up! Who are you to get my son married? You escaped death down below. You won't here get to do that here! Dad, no! Don't kill them, Dad. Dad! The flashback is of epic proportions! Grand gala wedding! We're dying! No! It's my fault. Leave my Anji, kill me. Amrutham! Anji! You are really my lifelong friend. Shoot me! No. Shoot me! No! Kill me! No! Shoot me. Shoot me, please. No! Shoot me, please. Kindly, shoot me! Shut up! I've come to kill you both! Ammu! Ammu! Ammu! Anji! - Ammu. - Dear! - Ammu. - Dear. - Ammu. - Dear. Smile, please. For the orbit photos? Mr. Engineer, give him my land. No, sir, give him my land. There's no oxygen here. Even an incense stick will not light up, how will they fire a gun? Get up! Get up, slowly. Slowly. We'll marry in the meanwhile. I'll try it by attaching my oxygen pipe to it. I'll see how he survives! Forget about his death, I'm about to die without oxygen. Forget these dud guns! Behead them with these swords. You! Oh, lord! What's happening? This spacesuit is like armor. It can withstand meteors. What can mere weapons do? Yes. Only if you remove these suits, - you'll die without need for any weapons. - Mr. Sharma! Shut it! Strip their clothes! Strip them! Open the suit! Ammu! - Sanju! - Ammu! Hey lord Krishna! Give me a sari Brother! - Amrutham! - Saree! Hey! Enough drama! Let us strip them, guys. Come! Oh, God! They are turning the moon into a nudist colony. We'll make them blind like Dhritarashtra. People of the moon! Only you can hear me. Those goons from Earth can't hear. They can't talk to each other. Because of the black screens, no one can recognize each other. While they are in this confusion, let us run to the lunar module. Come on! Follow me. I lifted my hand up. Run, girl! You Rogue, running off with my wife and daughter! Let them go! Let them go! Oh, God! Oh, God! Lift of? So soon? Where will you go? Stay back! My girl! - Sarvadu! - Get away! My girl! My girl! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero! For whom? The moon journey Getting away from Earth and going back! For whom? For whom? Why are you wailing? Has your pocket been picked? My girl! We left her back on the moon. Then who are they? Hey! Your girl. Girl's mother. Remove your helmets. Now, you have to face me for a year. I'll wipe the craters with your face! Free hit! Give these 50 rupees to him. Sarvadu, the balance left is one rupee. Yeah!
