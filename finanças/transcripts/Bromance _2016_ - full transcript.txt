You haven't changed that T-shirt in weeks... It has all my energy... What I don't understand is why didn't you take her home. Not all in life is babes. When you have to be at work the next day, you can't go out every night. Take a girl to a motel... You gotta start taking responsibilities. Uh, now you're gonna get all serious and responsible? We have the loser here for that. I say "fuck responsibilities". I think the girl was horrible. If not, you do fuck responsability... When you stop living with your parents you come and tell me fuck responsibilities... You have to pay the bills... - Oh God! - Let's stop here. No, I booked the Justice League Headquarters for us. - Are kidding? - No. What are we, 15 years old? I say we stay here. - And we haven't found our tree. - That's right, the tree. Tree! Fuck the tree! We are staying here. You are tired? Don't you see we are on vacation? Thank you! We are on vacation! Shout it out loud, feel the vacations. We are on vacation! Shout it out! - We could make a song... - We are on vacation... - We are on vacation! - We are on vacation! - We are on vacation. - Oh, you are so funny... - Mustn掐 be far away... - Let's take a run to the sea. (BROMANCE) JUSTICE LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS Keep some cassettes for later. - Don't worry. I brought a lot. - OK. Okay let's make the tent. Wait up, Adrian, we'll make it later. The night is coming and later it will be harder to do it. You make some mate, we'll do it later with Daniel. Pass the "yerba", Dani. - What "yerba"? - "Yerba", for mate. - Did I have to bring it? - Yes, where is it. - No I didn't bring it. - How come you didn't bring it? I brought the cassettes, I didn't have space for food. The cassette fits you in a pocket you moron! Adrian, relax... We came here to have a good time not to fight. So he didn't bring "yerba". I have some in my bag. No one died. Okay but can we make the tent now. Oh, man, you are so intense sometimes. Why am I "intense"? Dani help me out, daddy is pissed off. - Give me that. - Have some fun with this... - You poor thing... - You don't touch me. I think there's a hole there. If it rains... There's no hole. Then don't go crying later... The door should be where the land goes down. I think it would be best over there. If my clothes get wet, I'll kill him. Put this over there... They are doing a mess. How long does it take? This is not a picture, you morons... Oh, you think so clever, don't you... He thinks he is funny. He deserves a punishment. No, no, no tickles. Stop it! Get off of me! Magic for the camera... My dad, your mom will see it, they'll think wrong. - Cut it off. - Then you edit out, don't get cranky "She" gets so crazy. But you know, it's the other was around. I fuck him. Give me that. - Very good. - Keep going. Dani, come and play. My arm still hurts because of that little joke of yours. You sissy... We did nothing. Oh, leave him... Oh, yeah... - Look at that babe... - Not bad. If you stare like that, she will realize you are desperate. If she is topless, she wants to be stared at. Oh, men, you are more horny than Adri's dog. Give me that. - Now is my turn this side. - Why? It's my turn, come on. Let's see the peanut. - Stop it! - Come on! Show it! You're gonna spill water on the camera, morrons. What's the matter with you, wakko! You get crazy like a girl if we mess with you... Uh, he got angry, really angry. Really, guys, you are gonna get the camera wet! Stay still. - What you gonna shoot? - You. The light is amazing. - Tell me something. - Like what? A memory, I don't know. I don't know. When you were a kid. Something you don't want to forget. Oh, I know. Sixth grade. I almost get expelled from school. There you go... What did you do? I edited a porno magazine with a friend of mine, Jorge Granada. A porno magazine? He used to draw very well. I used to make up stories. We made up a story about a friend and a teacher. The little asshole found out... and as he was a cocksucker for the teacher, he told on us. I tore it up and I threw it in the basket. The teacher pull it out, taped it and gave it to the principal. They supinated my parents. It was a scandal. They told my mom they didn't kick me out... - because I was a good student. - You? She blamed it on Granada and never let me see him again. I wonder what has his life turned out. That's all. - Bring it. - What do you want? - Give me that! - What are you doing? No, don't! OK, now you tell me a secret. Me? A secret? I don't know... Something about your life. My life? Come over here. What are you going to do? - What are you afraid of? Come here! - What are you going to do? Here are to good friends. Best friends. Best friends... - I love you, buddy. - I love you too. Let's go to sleep. - Ok, we leave everything as it is? - Yeah. - Good night. - Good night. BATCAVE CYBERTRON JUSTICE LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS OK, let's see that peanut... - Shit, stop it... - Come on... show me... I'll make a zoom and make it look bigger... Oh, stop it, asshole... You are full of resentment. Stop it, you fucker! You see, you don't like it. You are such a piece of work. Good morning. - Good morning. - Adrian? He was sleeping. When I was little I used to play strip poker with a friend from primary school. The one that would loose, had to take the clothes off. The weirdest thing is that he would lose all the time... and ended up naked in front of me. After that we would jerk off. It looks your friend was a bit of a fag and wanted to show his cock. We were kids. Or was it the other way around? It's stuff you do as a kid. I'm messing with you. - Let's take a swim. - Now? Come on, don't be a sissy. - It's too cold. - Come on... - Come on... Get inside. - Let me go! Get in! I'm hungry. We better go back. - Hello! - Hi... Thanks for waking me up... What are you doing naked? We were copying the girls initiative. If she appears, she can see what we have to offer. Wait, we are leaving? I'm hungry. Let's go buy something at the store? - Did something happened? - No, nothing happened. - What happened? - Nothing. Daniel! Why didn't you wake me up? OK, what are we cooking? Are you kidding me? I'm starving. Let's buy some sandwiches and a beer. That's it. - OK. - Yeah. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. I'll have a Salami and cheese. I want ham, cheese and ham again. Ham and cheese. - Is there a phone here? - Right there... Can I have some coins? Thanks. - Guemes hospital, good morning. - Room 305, please. - Hello. - Hi dad. I'm calling from a paid phone so I'll be quick. How's everything there? Same as usual. You've been gone only for two days. - And gramps? - He is here, still hanging in there. What did the doctor say? Any progress? Are you feeling guilty. A gift... for your delay. Thanks. If you cared for him, you'd stayed. Don't start, we talked about this. Pass him the phone... He is sleeping right now. Fine. Send him my love. And tell mom not to worry, that we arrived OK. Give me a phone number so I can contact you. - What for? - "What for?" Would you like to eat with us? Looks like the little boys need some girly attention... Maybe... OK, take note... 025-43824 What's your name? - Julieta. - Santiago. Bye. Something wrong, Adri? They may call me. Is there a problem? Don't worry boy, I'll yell at you if they do. - What's your name? - Adrian Aued. Guys, we have a visitor for lunch. Her name is Juli. Juli, this are my best friends: Adrian and Daniel. What's up, ass. The girl is over there Shut up and follow me... You are so stupid... They found a UFO... Hope you can take the pressure. A UFO? Fuck! You stole it? Some day you'll go to jail. Yeah, yeah. Move it, move it! Here, Santi, you tape now... You left me all alone. I'm working on a dentist's office... - Very good, Beto Marsico... - as a secretary. - Because of how fat you are... - I want no more. I got bored. I want to save money. Work less hours. I want to go on a trip to Europe this year. I have some friends who are going to do that. Waitress? You shouldn't... Haven't you got a degree yet? I wanna quit the university. And what would you like to do? I don't know. Live day by day. - Very good. - Sing, maybe. Let's go back... I'm getting hungry... Do not laugh... I swear it was like that... I do not believe you... And what did she say? Nothing, kissed me on the cheek and left. I don't believe you... How the mighty have fallen. - Tell me you are lying, please. - No. - OK, I'm dead. - No, please. - I'll go to sleep. - No, please a little longer. Can't keep my eyes open. See you tomorrow? - Bye. - See you. - Don't touch yourself. - Bye. And you? You couldn't turn him down, don't you? - Him? - Yes, him. I don't know. He hasn't even tried... - And you have a boyfriend? - No. But you had. Long time ago... I'm single... and free now. Interesting. Free. As in... Trying women now? You are so stupid. No, I'm not into girls. Although you never know the turn of the tides. Hell yeah to the turn of the tides. And why did you split? If I may ask... Well I'm asking... Uh, long story, but to make it short. - If you please... - OK. He was a boy I knew from kindergarten. We've been boyfriend and girlfriend since forever. He was a jerk. But I wasn't attracted to him anymore. I didn't want to hurt him. So to end it, I told him I've met someone. A woman. You are lying. Why would you say that? The curious thing is that in time, I came across him again, he was coming down the street dressed up as a Drag Queen. - He was a real fag. - I traumatized him. Disgusting! You wouldn't traumatize me. I'd have asked you to invite me to the party. - You are so crazy. - Yes, that would be crazy. Really creazy! Well, I think I better go to sleep. - Don't be a pussy boy... - No, really, I'm tired... - Get some rest... - Good night. And don't you make a move on Dani... Oh, you are so funny. So you are a womanizer? Well, womanizer... I wouldn't put it that way. I like women, but I don't date as much as Adrian says. - I don't care. - Ah, you don't? I used to date a lot of men. And I mean "a lot". - You have something in your eye... - Yeah, the smoke is killing me... No, let me see. If that got in your eye, you could have lost it. Look at that. Oh, I think you have something on your lip. Right there. - Yeah, now is gone. - You sure? - What do you want? - For you to stand, silly. - I have a standing ovation. - Oh, come on... - Good morning. - Hello. Good morning. Why didn't you wake me up? The day is perfect. We slept on Juli's tent. Do you know anything about Daniel? He wasn't at the camp either... No, haven't seen him since last night. He might be filming for sure. ^ICome over here.^I ^I-What are you going to do? - What are you afraid of?^I ^I-Here are two good friends. - Best friends.^I You were here? Where were you? Around... Shooting. Did you shot anything good? - Trees. - Let me see. You'll get bored. I'll edit it, add some music... - It will be cool. - Cool. You could have come to the beach. I mean, we came to be together on this vacation, right? Yeah, I lost track of time. Then come back to the future... I'll get a shower. What's up between Daniel and you? What do you mean? - Daniel is gay, isn't he? - Gay? Why would you say that? He looks funny at you. No, Dani and I are friends since, forever. He is not gay for sure. OK. And your other friend... Adrian. He is not gay either. He is cute. Yes. But he doesn't think so. He gives up easily. But cute. You're gonna leave me for him? Why? Are we dating? We are a couple? No. You like him? He is cute, that's all. If he straight himself, he might get lucky. Yes, I guess so. You put your camp too far away! - You are going to make it dizzy. - You leave it to me. You might know how to make it, but I know my ways... - It will be great. - Ok, you're making it. Exactly. - Try it. - And Santiago? He went with that girl to her tent. Do you think you can find love in the wrong person? Sure. I love you. What? What's up with you? I'm messing with you. Why? You like the girl with Santiago? Not in the least. Then? Who do you like? You never told me about her. - Nobody. - Come on, tell me... No, nobody. I caught up in the thought. 'Cause, you hear all this songs talking about strong love... Yes. But they are all broken love or finished... Exactly. Because they weren't the right person. Yes, that's why girlfriends pass by but friends stay. Sex fucks up everything. Yes. But you can't have sex with your friends. No, that's why friends are better than girlfriends. A friend is like a sexless girlfriend. Thank God. I wouldn't like to fuck you. - Why? - It would be disgusting. - How's it going? - Good good... You two? Can I have a "mate"? How was it to sleep in the wild? Nature? We spent the night at her tent. I thought it might be better to bring it here. This way we are all together. Is that "mate" coming or not? Should we prepare the tent? Hey! We could go to see the football match later. Yeah, cool. - What do you think about this bitch? - I don't know. Get it in! I didn't think of you as a football enthusiast. What's your team? Boca. But I'm not that enthusiast. I'm not a fanatic, not that much. I only make noise when the boys are around, to annoy them. - I'm a "Pincha"'s fanatic. - Who? Estudiantes de La Plata. They call it "Pincha". Is a family tradition. - That's why. - Cool. Can I have a beer and some fries? Nice girl, Juli Although, you could have asked... Eh, is not that big a deal. I'm not upset. Sounds like it, but I'm not. - Then? - Take it as a call of attention. We came to have a good time the three of us, right? Is just that I wanted something different... and I think you too. Yes... We had a different idea. You are right. We had another idea. - I'm right. - You are right. But, I won't kick her off now. Of course, is not that big a deal. Hey, kid, you father called. He said it was urgent. OK, thanks. Adri, aren't you gonna call your father? No need... What are you talking about? His father called, said is urgent. Did something happened? Gramps is in the hospital. That's happening. I don't wanna call. Gramps in the hospital? Why didn't you say so? He was in for a routine check up... But if he is calling saying is urgent it might be something. I don't want to talk. I already said so. So shut the fuck up! Do what you want... Come back. Goal! Eat that! Come on, my dear "diablo"! You are going to start dancing now... you little schmuck! Men, you better stop with this tickling nonsense. I'm all scratched out... If you want I have some cream you can borrow. Do I look like a girl to you? I don't wear creams. OK, it was just a suggestion. Hey, you're gonna get drunk... Your not my father... How come you turned to be so responsible? Do you want to bet who can take more? You are going to lose. And then, you'll end up naked like your little friend. What are you talking about? Nothing. You better start telling the story, 'cause I'm starting to freak out. Nothing, a stupid story. Supposedly a secret... I used to play poker with a friend from primary school. If you lose, you'd start "selling" your clothes. And he ended up only with his briefs. What a faggot you friend. I told him, he might wanted for Dani to look at him naked. And he surely jerked off thinking about him. Did he write love letters to you too? Oh, fuck off. Who would jerk off thinking about you... you are so ugly... You are wrong. He is such a pretty boy. If any of my girl friends were here, they would be all over him. Not me? No. You lack the intrigue that Daniel generates. He is like a James Dean. Mysterious, quiet. I imagine him at the back of a bar, drinking whisky, alone. That drives us crazy... Oh, James Dean... Oh, James Dean, come give us a kiss. Stop! Stop that! What you never said... Is if your friends would be all over me... Why so interested? You want to trade me? Not at all... First, if you are with me, they wouldn't even dare to touch you... And second, if I would let you free, Daniel would still beat you. Look that... and you were saying he was gay. Is just that... it makes him irresistible. They al have this stupid dream to convert a gay boy. Plus, they make the perfect husband. It was a joke. Come on, come here... Why don't you stop it with this Dani business. He is what he is. He messes with me. What are you talking about? He barely notices you. He wants to steal my boy. Your boy? You are so out of your head. You got mad? ^I♪fucking baby♪^I ^I-Tell me a secret. - A secret?^I ^I-Something about your life. - My life?^I ^I-Come over here. - What are you going to do?^I You ass, you scared me. I saw you leaving and I thought you were going to the beach. Yes, I was going. But the camera is not working right... Were you filming? No. I was cleaning the camera. We going? Santi... wait... I'd like to talk. About what? The other day. What do you want to talk about it? Let me see. I think it was something strange. I don't know, something happened to me. Nothing happened. I don't understand, something happened to me. You sure nothing happened to you? What happened to you? I don't know. Your cock got hard? You liked it? Is that what happened? You got a hard on? Come on, take it seriously. You want to suck my cock? Is that? Like you did with your little friend. The one who loose was you, didn't you? - Stop it! - Come on, tell me what happened? You want me to pull it out? You want to suck my cock? I'll take it out. Stop it! You are going nuts... - Why? - Because you are doing shit. - Says who? - I say so. This is bullshit. I don't know. Something happened to me. I'd like to know for sure what happened to you. Taking the jokes aside. Nothing happened to me! Stop messing with me. Then why are you acting like this? - What's the matter with You? - You asshole. Wait, Daniel! Fuck you! - Good morning. - Hello. Why don't we start all over again? Start what? Us. There's no reason for us not getting along. Santiago told me to come here with you, and we should all be happy. I don't know what you mean. I can tell he didn't ask you, and you didn't like it. I didn't like it but it has nothing to do with you. Give me the mate. OK, then lets start over. Let's! Julieta Scardale. Adrian Aued. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Wanna go to the beach? Aren't we waiting for the boys? They might be over there. Or they'll catch up later with us. Yes, you are right, they always left me here. OK, let's go! I just didn't think Santi would leave you too. Let's go. Let's take the mate. OK, let's go... The other day you were kind of upset because of your gramps. Are you better now? More or less. You care for him a lot... When my parents went to live to Brasil I had to stay here. I was lonely and friendless. He was my world. Then I started school. Make friends. How long has been since you saw him the last time? Since he got sick. He forbid me to go to the hospital. My father never understood. He sais I'm not fulfilling my obligations as a grandson. What can I do? Why don't you call? Clear your doubts. Maybe is not that serious. And what if it is? I don't want to see him in a coffin, white. I rather remember him as usual, going to the stadium, Like when he took me to have sex for the first time. But is also important to accept that life has it's way. You have a soft side. You shouldn't hide it. Don't hide it. I don't know why am I so tired. You went M.I.A. all day. I needed to clear my mind. In the end, that was our intention with this trip. Can we talk? We are talking. Don't dodge the subject. You don't fool me... You have something with Daniel. The only thing I was missing, that now you think I'm gay too. If you have feelings for him, it's fine. I just need to know. I want to know were I'm standing. I've had enough of you. Don't be like that, I want us to talk. Look, you came looking for cock. If you don't like it, go find someone else to fuck you. You are such an asshole. Get out... GET OUT! Fucking asshole. Take all your stuff! Hello... How you doing? Can I make a phonecall? - Yes, sure. - Can I get some coins? Thanks. Hello. - Hi, dad! - Adrian! It's been two days since I called. Where are you? I'm still here. I couldn't call. What happened? What happened? The inevitable. And you are fooling around. Your mother is a wreck. We had the service already and took him to the cemetery. You missed it all. No, no. I didn't miss anything. - And gramps loved you so much. - It was his idea. What are you talking about? It was his idea for me to leave. He didn't want me there. But you are not gonna understand. Then, explain... No, I have nothing to explain to you. Please explain... Look, I'll stay for a couple more days. I'll call when I get there. Adrian, wait... Can I have a Tequila and a whisky bottle? Help yourself. - How much is it? - $14... Why? Daniel! What? I wanted to apologize... About what? About today. No, you forgive me... I don't know what's happening. I don't know. It's too much, all together. No... I am... I am... I am the one who has to apologize. I am the one who... I'm sorry. And the boys? I don't know. I'm no one's baby-sitter. Are you OK? I called home. He died. What you doing? It's OK. I'm no longer with Santi. We fought and split up. - You split up? - Who? Yes. Wasn't meant to be. No, it didn't. I'll help you to move your tent back. I rather stay here with Adrian. Oh boy... you're fast. Less complicated you mean. Do you mind? Not at all. Adri? What's the matter? - Gramps died. - What? - Where were you? - What do you mean "gramps died"? Where were you?! He died? We gotta go back... - We pick up everything... - No, I want to stay here. We go back. We are really close. It was a few days ago. They already buried him. All the more reason to go back! Adri... I want to stay. I want to celebrate. I want to make a toast. Grab the camera, Dani... We have to immortalize this. - You sure? - Yes. Ready... To gramps, for his wisdom, for his teachings, for his life, and for teaching me how to lead my life. Cheers! - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheers. Daniel... look... ehm... We... I mean... yesterday... Hello! Let's put some music on, let's do something. This is starting to look like a wake. Come on, Adri... You said you wouldn't get upset about your grandad. Get up! I'm going to make you forget. It seems to me you're a bit out of place, girl. Give her a break. She's right. No, she's not right. Your grandpa's dead. It's normal for you to be sad. I think Daniel's got a point. Oh, sure, now he's got a point. What's the matter babe? Freaking out 'cos it's been a while without dick? What do you say? Being surrounded by closet cases is what freaks me out. - You're disgusting. - You are crossing the line. What? Are you afraid Adrian finds out? - Juli, Stop it! - What are you talking about? - They didn't tell you? - Juli, shut the fuck up. Are you boyfriends already? I'm sick of you... The three of you. Two repressed and coward fags! And you are a hen-pecked following this two arround. If your friendship is so strong, you should turn gay too... and you'll have an unforgettable three-way!? Shut the fuck up, you Cock-tease! What the fuck! You are crazy... I'm going! You bunch of assholes. Go fuck yourself! Pussy boys... OK, that was a thunderstorm all right... What's just happened? - Shut up Adrian... - I won't shut up. You and Daniel... He's talking to you. Answer him... No, he and I, nothing... 'Cos he's too much of a wuss... He's a fag and a wuss, Good-looking is not enough... You've got to have balls too... Otherwise you'll be hiding all your life. Yeah, I'm gay and I don't give a shit what you think... I don't give a fuck... And I do have the balls to deal with whatever may come.. I don't understand. You... Juli... Dani and I... Are you into me? Come on! Well, would you throw some goddamned light one it? What do I have to explain? Are you my dad? Explain all the time what I do, what I don't... You're not my girlfriend! You're supposed to be my friend! I don't know anymore... Neither do I... Fuck this shit... ^IHere we are about to start the journey.^I ^IThe stories this camping could tell.^I ^IYears of hand-jobs and football.^I ^IYour left lots of trees pregnant...^I ^I-I love you, buddy - I love you too.^I Daniel... Look, I'm really sorry that you think I'm a coward... But maybe I am... But I can't go along that road... I'd really like it if we could still be friends... That's impossible. I've got feelings for you when you are around. I don't know... I get goosebumps... I get nervous... And I like it... I like it a lot. I can't be your friend. I don't want to be your friend. Not anymore. Move away, you fag! What crawled up that one now? Adrian, what the fuck's up? You have a problem with me 'cos I'm gay? Come on out and talk. We are all friends again. Everything's sorted out with Santiago... We ain't doing anything... You're absolutely not my type. You are a coward! Come on out, you coward! Here I am! You having a meltdown? Why don't you stick your fit of hysteria up your ass... - Guys, chill out. - Shut the fuck up! You know... the same way you surely stick who knows what... - You think I can't take you? - You feel a real man now? You fucking assholes... Wait, wait, stop, stop! The videos! Leave them... It's done... JUSTICE LEAGUE HEADQUARTERS
