What are you doing, Laura? Nothing. I don't know what you'll do during the holidays... We're very busy and can't offer you any entertainment. Don't worry about me. Last year we were able to use it for your throat operation. This year I can break a leg, if you wish. Three to Juaréz just this summer. And all of them married by the bishop. I'm going to town I want to get some books. They let you go? So you decided to come? Why shouldn't I? Thought you'd be afraid to. - Afraid of what? - Well, you were last year. I was younger. And now? What's the worst that could happen? A lot. Didn't your friends tell you? Do you dare? Or would you like to dance? Are you coming? Did you just return? No, a while ago. Are you hungry? Is mother still upstairs? Where else? She has to be with him. What for? He can't even talk. Why not taking him outside? He's very heavy. Would you like me to replace her? I'd like to know how he is. No one can see him. We don't expose our shame. Father left you a really nice gift, didn't he? You've grown this summer. Don't forget that disgrace can befall on anyone. Post. From America. The stamps have changed Look at this one. From the Big Three reunion, of course, this was before the Korea thing. Your aunt loves writing? Every single Friday. You look like her, you know? She lives in Alcatraz since she married. Madness. With so many beautiful places to choose from. And she goes and settles in a little town called a prison. Some places aren't named as prisons, but still are. She never writes to her. Every letter sent here is for your mother. Don't forget to ask for the stamps. I doubt they'll make reproductions. It's always the same. I don't understand why you don't love me. Too prudish for what lives in your house. What do you care? The whole town talks about it, you've got a madman locked up there. And what do you know about him? One night, I saw him. Walking on the terrace dressed in white. Bobbing his head. His hair covering his face. Really? Well... it was night time, what do I know? And what do I care? I brought you an amazing book. It's on my bike. If it's as bad as the last one, keep it. What was wrong about the last one? The cover was amazing. It didn't have much class. It was all about filthy stuff. This one's based on a film, "A Farewell To Arms" or something. The the chap at the book store said it's superb. You should read some of those type of books someday, Miguel Read? What for? It only confuses you. - What else did he do on the terrace? - Who? "He", on the terrace. God, you're such a pain. Plus, how do you even know it's a "he"? What do you mean? We all know it's a little man. It looked like he had a dress on. Maybe it was a nightshirt. And you've never seen him while living in the house? Let go, I'm leaving. - Don't you want the book? - Another day... Raise your bosom, Amanda, there's nothing to be ashamed of. The altar is conquered by honesty and a upright chest. Hold still. It's just a moment or two. Of course, if I were Plácido Hernández... We have to fix your bosom. Look how dreamy. Only fairies could do such wonders. You must have a hidden gnome somewhere. Laurita, dear. You look wonderful. Look, Amanda. Doesn't she look like Inés? Yes. She's so gorgeous. What's the news with Inés, Lisa? Always in Alcatraz? Her husband's a pharmacist? No, he has a convenience store. Don't tell me it's one of those chemists where they sell from ice-cream to laxatives and pyjamas. They really sell all kinds of things? Not all kinds of things. Even the brassieres come with everything on them. But not everyone needs it. Stay still a second, or I'll poke you again. How wonderful. And to think some women lust for nylon... There are some nice colours on nylon. Maybe for tramps. I wouldn't wear it. The appreciation for fine lingerie has been lost. In the old days, not even harlots... Remember Inés? What a crime. To leave an Achával for an American. And why is it? Inés is the happiest woman on Earth. But away from her environment. Luckily, he was able to rebuild his life. He has a beautiful family. And the moment he liquidated his assets, his wife dies. A beautiful pair of families. Because they said that in Buenos Aires he has another life- Is he a widow? Isn't this hot weather? Poor dear María Marta, with that wretched man. What's wrong with Laura? Hold still, Amanda. - You were looking for me, Laura? - I heard some noises. Was something wrong with him? It's alright, now, just a fainting. - I can help you - You're too young to see him. - Let's dance. - Leave me alone. - Come, kiss me - Leave me alone, I tell you. Sorry, your highness. Who do you think you are? - One of these days I'll ask you for something - Do it now First I need to know something. Wait for me in the park after dinner. Peas again? I've told you they're not good for him. It's not easy picking a new dish every day. Neither is living in locked room your whole life. Like there's so much to see here... Sometimes I wished I was in his shoes. I won't be able to do this forever Perhaps Laura... Get out of there. Crawl through here. Pleasant lavender scent. You think? Smells like an ill person to me. It's wonderful. You make it yourself? It's a gift from mother. - Come - Wait. Let's go inside. For what?. - You have to help me - To do what? To spy on the madman. That's why I'm here?. Don't get angry, didn't you want me to take a look? Yes, you. But what has your madman have to do with me? Don't you want to help me? Of course. What's that? Sewing. All night long? - What about the... - I don't know. We have to wait until they fall asleep. I'm hungry. - You want an apple? - Any bread? I'll find out. Wait. Kiss me. Do I smell of onions? Then kiss me again. - Aren't you hungry? - Not now. Come. Not here, they may come down. Close the door. It smells of mothballs here. Was this the only place you could think of? The place is filled with rats. - Are you afraid? - Not me. Until last year I had a domesticated one on the attic. But given that you're so afraid of them... That was before. There are so many things worse than rats. Like a lunatic? That's not what I meant. Come on now. - You've never seen him? - Never They say it's your father's son. Then it is my half-brother. We can't call everything our fathers have "brothers". That's why I must see him. What? You want to see if you're alike? Don't be afraid, you're gorgeous. Not always. What's wrong? You hear that? - What? - The silence. So what? It's time. You've got to help me. Help you? How? Come. His room door is locked. But he gets his food through this lift twice a day. Are you mad? I've tried it, I can go up with it. I just need you to pull this rope eight times. Not one more, or you'll send me to the attic. Here. Will you do it? And then what? Whatever you want. Whatever I want? Why not? Alright. You look like a little lamb. If I knock three times you bring me down. Pull. You saw him? - How is he? - What? Hairs on the face? Maybe a hunch? I don't know, I didn't see him. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Now, what do you want? Me? Nothing. You said it... What did I say? That whatever I wanted... What do we do? Well, I don't really know. Come on. Let's kiss if you want to. We made a pact. You helped me. But not like this. Then what? Let's go elsewhere. I don't like this. We can go wherever you want to. Well... I don't know, it's pretty late, really. Everyone's asleep. What did you see? Why are you talking like that? We had a pact, correct? And on and on with this "pact". I'm hungry, isn't there any food? You'll wake the maid. You want dessert? Chicken? Coffee? Then will we be even? I think you better go to sleep. My mother always saves me some leftovers. Because when I come home late I'm always hungry. Then I don't owe you? I don't understand you. I like you, it's not like a business deal. See you tomorrow? Perhaps. I have a lot to do in this house. I don't like this place. It's the closest thing to a ghost story I've seen. We've got to be done with ghosts, Miguel. Tonight you miss your chance of killing one. You're so strange, you know that? I like you better in daytime, by the tree. I don't like you like this. Your torch. Why does Aunt Inés never visit? Because she's quite well where she is. Quite well, and quite away from her family, and in a town like Alcatraz. And we only know that it was named after the prison? Alcatraz is wonderful, and she is in a great social position. Are there any current pictures of her? I only remember her as a girl my age. Inés doesn't send pictures. Who's this "Cristóbal Achával"? What? Was he your boyfriend or hers? Hers. Lord have mercy. - She did right in leaving him - She left him? She was smart and married a foreigner. And not like your mother, to whom your father, God forgive him, left her all his sins, like a life sentence. Why do you say that about my father? You agree with what he did? No, it was horrible. Help me out, will you? You here, miss Laura? Something for mother? Friday's usual letter from your aunt Inés. - They've become famous in all town - I'll take it, don't worry. They went back to the Statue of Liberty. They say there are nice looking postcards with space rockets now. But it's probably the Russians. And when will there be any letters for you? Every youngster in town is moving to Buenos Aires now. There's still time for that. Don't count on that. Men have to be caught with traps, rifles... And pretty soon with machine guns too. What? You're getting love letters now? - It's for my aunt Inés - The American. The one who lives in North America. They don't do things like us here. Here Spaniards and Italians are still foreigners at age thirty. There, if they don't become citizens, they get kicked out. So sad to lose your own nationality. Like it's worth something. You never saw her? They say it was the only Laviña woman worth something. My mother worked at your house in those times. They threw some insane parties. Then one day, everyone got fired. Your aunt left Achával and moved to America. - You knew Cristóbal Achával? - Who doesn't? He still lives here? Where else? He pretty much owns the town. He has a Jaguar. He likes racing. Last year, he won the 500s. This year, he plays polo. But I can't stand his children. Bunch of snobs. - You heard that second gear? - That's Cristóbal Achával. Any day now he hits a tree and becomes worm food. He's really young. Sure, with the life he has. If he were a bricklayer... And he plays polo too? That's what they say. I don't like that little ball and sticks game. It's like golf but on a horse, a sissies' game. - Where does he play? - Why so curious? You're being annoying. I'm not asking you to come, just tell me where is it. Now I'm your errand boy? I'm sick of this. First the eccentric, now Ochával... I'm missing out on a lot hanging with you. You can leave whenever you want, Miguel. Your work was done after pulling the rope for the eighth time. Come on, get on the bike. - Don't act all mysterious with me. - I'll walk this time. I think I have a lot to know about this town. Well, as you wish. You're Laura, right? Come. Can I? Yes, come. Lisa was right. You're just like me. I won't say anything I won't tale a soul. Not even to Alicia or my mother, I swear. My likeness. That's what everybody says. Everybody? The postman, the people at school... They've talked so much... You're old enough to know. Living there, it had to happen. Why? Why do they keep you locked up here? No one's forcing me. I chose to stay myself. You want to stay here? Why? It's a long story. I need to know. Not now, another time. Don't say anything. I told you he comes around here. But you never know when exactly. I'll keep waiting. And you don't want to see him at his house? - I need to sell him some raffle tickets. - There's a lot of raffles going on lately. "Are you there, my heart? I can't hear you beating..." Don't tell me you're a mechanic now, Laura. I'm still in training, the nuns want to me to drive. Where will we see you at the country club? We're having so much fun. I was thinking of going Saturday. Come on, stop acting so puritan. Is there anybody working here? - What's with all the honking? - Five litres. - Is it for your lighter? - Are you fellows also comedians? - Yes, that's us, alright. - Here's the key Do you smoke? The box says "Chester" but they are national. - He's too old for those antics. - He's still hot. Last year he had to get an overhaul after the accident. He had an accident? Racing the 500; he's into that stuff now. Knowing his family, it wouldn't surprise me if he became a scuba-diver. Keep the change. What change? Bye, Laurita Come join us at the club. Tell Virginia to take you. And take your bathing suit, they've already opened the pool. Well? I need... I'd like... But you are a Laviña. I need to talk to you. Well, it don't think this is the right place, and I can only offer you the seat of my car. Hold on a minute. So, how many raffle tickets do I have to buy for your school, to get a spot up there? I'm not here to sell you tickets. Do you go to Ana's school? Or is it something about Horacio? Your sons? They're your age, but look like my brothers. What is this about, then? You can help me. It's something very important and very sad. So that's the situation? And what can be so sad to worry that pretty face? Do you remember this picture? It's me. You almost can't tell. And this is Lisa. Last year, I saw her in the town's founders memorial. Our honourable ancestors who had to killed so many Indians to take their lands. You're Faustino's daughter? Inés was beautiful, wasn't she? Very beautiful. You almost marry her... Yeah, I think so, She was proud as hell. I needed two years in Paris to forget her. - What about her? - Why are you asking me? It's your aunt. I wanted to know if you remembered all of that. The whole town remembers it. She married the moment we separated. With a foreigner, no less. She didn't marry. I don't understand. I don't think she ever did. She lives in America. You mean she had a divorce? She doesn't live in America. I don't think she ever left this town or even her house. What's this fairy tale? Come on, get hold of yourself. There's a coffee shop at the end of the street. Don't tell me you don't like ice-cream... Now we're on the same road. You better tell me everything. I'm in the house for little time. I'm a pupil at The Orchard's Garden boarding school. I only come here for the holidays. I always thought that in the forbidden upper floor of that house lived that little monster, a distant relative of my father. You mean you've never seen him while staying there? One day I decided to spy on him. And it wasn't him that I found. What did you find? My aunt Inés. What the hell are you saying? You must be mistaken. The lunatic was always there. I even remember when they brought him. I'm telling you what I saw. Or what you think you saw? That little head of yours must be full of cheap romance novels. What kind of books do you like? I'm afraid talking to you was a waste of time. This is what happens when you nose around other people's rooms. - Would you dance with me? - Call me as soon as they play a tango. Who'd dance a tango now? That's for when you're sad. Like I am. Hello, mother. Cristóbal. Look how good is Martin reading hands. He can see two more marriages left for me. Congratulations, Antonieta. Elisa, I won't be able to join you in Buenos Aires tomorrow. That must be the setback you read, Martín. - What a nuisance. I've got to get ready for the grand Prix. And the car needs some work. You'll get your head smashed again, Cristóba.. - Why don't you play golf? - You know, I had a great time at the clinic. An encounter. Cristóbal, your sister has an amazing Venus line. All the better for you. Ladies and gentlemen. A memorable date brings us together today. Today is the anniversary of our town's founding. And it was right here where its noble founders had the courage to put up the first fence symbolising civilisation in the fight- in the fight against the Indians. Two honourable families, descended from those first men inherited a legacy of honour and nobility. We are fortunate to have them among us. The Achával and Laviñe families Maintaining stoic principles of tradition and lineage. I invite you then, to a celebration to reinforce the pride this ceremony stands for. Father. The mayor said we looked like boyfriend and girlfriend. Tell López not to be rude, fathers never look like boyfriends. Just friends. - Hey, did you see the Harrisons' Cadillac? - Who didn't? It's huge. I need to see you. Let's go, Lisa isn't feeling well. Having a drink? Watch yourself for the Grand Prix. This is plain water, Lopez, plain water. - What are you standing there for? - Where are you going? Come on. We're going to the river. - Let's go. - Come with us. Check out these babes. Hurry up. Stop playing Brando. Alright, I'm here. Come on, get on. I'm sorry but I've been thinking about this for days now. I want to know everything. Maybe I could help you if you want. You looked so hopeless, and I remembered Ana, my older daughter. She's your age. These are letters from America supposedly sent by Inés. So for the last 15 years, she's been getting these absurd letters from a convict. While she lives jailed in that room. And mother and Lisa are her accomplices in this ruse. And all that... why? Pride, fear of being humiliated. - Horror - What horror? I don't know for sure. But I think you're the key to everything that's happened. Me? Why me? Many men leave their fiancées before or after their engagement. What's that nonsense? I don't know. But I need to understand it. Why worry about things like these at your age? Who cares about who's locked in that room? Locked up for twenty years. Do you know what that's like? Yes, I had a cousin whose father locked her in a room for being insane. And there she is, still. Everyone has the fate they deserve, or the one they sought after But she isn't insane. You will if you keep obsessing over this. Come, I want to show you something. See? Here are your peers. People your age. That's my daughter, Ana. And that's Cristobal junior. He's a superb racer, already. And an amazing polo player too. - Hi. - Hey. - This is Laura Laviña, you know her? - Hi. Did you sign up already? - Of course. - You'll race with the Maserati or the Jaguar? - Not sure, I've been doing laps with the Jaguar. How did you unearth her? - Let me introduce you. - No need. - Hold on, I'll be right back. - Don't worry. I'll go get a drink. Can you give me a drink? - Having fun? - Why wouldn't I? Liar. How do we turn that frown upside down? Are you still thinking about that dreadful story? At your age Laura- You know that's the first time I've addressed you by your name? I'm not a liar, and it really is a dreadful and terrible story. That's the truth. There are many truths. It's also true that you're gorgeous. And that I'm not too old... And that I like you very much. It's already seven. The mechanic is waiting for me. Give you a lift? You know something? I'd like to race the Indy 500 with you by my side. - I wouldn't be of much help. - You have no idea how much you're helping me. How? By making me think I'm not such a bad chap, and because I don't leave women locked up for twenty years. When... when can I see you again? - What for? - To see you. Even if I have to listen to your fantastic stories. The day after tomorrow then? Meet me in the usual place? Where, then? My house. Where is it? My house at midnight. I'm not used to climbing balconies. There'll be no balconies. By the end of Arcos' Street, at the end of the park, there's a greenhouse. There we can talk undisturbed. I've already delivered the combinations, I'm just missing the backrests and the quilted pillow cases It's been a terrible summer. My fingers feel so worn out... Even in winter, my hands sweat. We're not youngsters like you, Laura. At your age, skin, fat and bone are all one. At our age, everything rebels. Skin, fat and bone. Nothing's together anymore. You must be tired, let me clear the table. I'll accept your offer tonight. Thank you. See you tomorrow, Laura. - Does she sleep? - She's been sewing so much these past nights... Aunt Inés. Who's calling? I'm Laura. I need to talk to you. I need to see you. That's impossible. I'm coming. I'll set the ladder just like the other night. Laura, no. Don't. Just for a moment. What a beautiful room. You like it? I don't see the walls anymore. Or the doors, or the furniture. I barely look at the mirrors. Why? Why, so many years...? All of this will be yours. I've heard you grow up. I've wanted to talk to you so many times... I waited for the summer just to hear your voice. But they didn't want that. Have they confined you here? I chose this myself. But why? So many years ago... Is that Cristóbal Achával? Cristóbal Achával was always the youngest one. The most arrogant one. He was always smiling. Always had the right lines, the right words. Every girl was in love with him. And he... This used to be the house's patio. I remember it like it was yesterday. I can still see it like it was yesterday. Cristóbal and I were supposed to get married. We were the most beautiful couple in town. And because of being the most beautiful, the most envied, the most exposed, the most observed one. If he arrived at the country club five minutes before me, everyone was already making up stories. If I happened to be alone in the theatre box, they started gossiping and saying we had broken up. We felt like characters from a romance novel. But then, your father... Everything began with him. Powerful, sole heir of the land surrounding the town. Arrogant and standoffish. He came one night, announcing what would become the prelude to our doom. I still remember his words. His mother has died. He's my son. You'll have to take care of it like it's your own. What's wrong? Don't forget I took you out of poverty. A loony in your house. What a lovely gift. Everyone in town knows about it. I guess you won't show him. Have you seen his mother? Are you sure he inherited from her? How would you think that? Our old patrician families have their oddities. Intermingling with Indians, fevers... I hope our descendants don't pay for our mistakes. Maybe that's why I was weak with him. After that, your father's death... We weren't that envied couple anymore. For fear of losing him, I gave up my convictions. My sense of shame, my dignity. After that, how many times I waited for him in the old country club. "We had to transform to such degree that..." "That our union would become a genuine marriage." "Goodbye." "He's gone." "The greatest of miracles." I think Cristóbal never forgave us for that deformed being introduced to the family. I have to tell you something. You're very important to me. We have to postpone the engagement. I want to continue studying in the University of Buenos Aires. Just another year. Maybe I'll leave before that, Cristóbal. We Laviñas are not patient people. Cristóbal is leaving me. There'll be neither engagement nor wedding. - What?. - He has just told me. What do we do now? - What do we do? - I won't be able to take it. I'm leaving town tonight. Maria Marta, Inés, come. He's dead. That night we buried him in the patio. Beneath the statue of Venus and the tiger. Perhaps it was Lisa, perhaps Maria Marta. Perhaps the three of us had the idea at the same time. I'd live locked up in here, instead of the child. We'd weave the story of a lavish wedding with a foreigner. We'd have mail sent to us. Nobody but us would know the truth. Nobody but us must know. Nobody will ever know. Everything was carefully planned. Everything. Even my own death. I'll also be buried in the garden. Beneath the statue of Venus and the tiger. You can't keep living like this. Is there other way? Everyone believed I married a very wealthy man. A foreigner. I was the lucky one. It was me who was loved. And he was the rejected one. Cristóbal Achával. The days, months, and years passed assured me of my triumph. There was no loneliness. There was no sadness. But that is terrible. It's all a lie. Nobody thinks about... Nobody remembers you. Nobody? I'm all the town talks about. If you knew that he's a different man, that he has forgotten everything. That for him and the town we're only "The Laviñas". The embroiderers. You have so much to learn, Laura... You don't know that memories are branded by fire. Look at yourself. Look at me. This is who we are. This is what's left. - I didn't think you'd show up. - Why would I lie to you? Because I still think you're fond of lies. Like the story of your aunt being locked up in your house. You can see her tonight, if you wish. Come. Look, if this is true, I'll take you to Europe. My treat. I won't take your money. Show her to me, then. We'll have to wait now. Come. And how are you going to show me this ghost? It's too early, still. You'll see her soon. Follow me. Couldn't we take care of our thing first? - I don't matter. - Yes, you do. Very much. You sure you haven't read Modena's Bride? I can't say I have. A woman who, on her wedding night, played hide and seek with her husband, hide herself inside a chest. No one could find her. Twenty years later, they found her skeleton wrapped in tulle. But this Modena's Bride is alive. And she never had a husband to play hide and seek with. You know something? I've been in this greenhouse before. The plants and I were younger. Nevertheless... you know you look a lot like her. And I feel... as young as then. Now you'll see your Modena's Bride. I'll always protect you. Always. I can't offer you much, because of my children, you know? I don't want to get married. I didn't think you'd be like this. Well, you are. I thought, that at your age, and with me starting to like you... And asking me to come here... Now we'll go to Inés' balcony. I didn't lie. You'll see her. Maybe tomorrow. No. Now. Right now. Come in, hurry. I was waiting for you. I think I'll wait for you every night. I'm not alone anymore. You're like a part of this room. I didn't mean to disturb you. I had a cake made, just like the old times. Just for us. Summer holidays will be over soon, and I'll have to go back to school. One more year and you'll graduate. You don't have a boyfriend? If you ever do, remember that the thing that matters the most is to save your dignity. Keep it. For a woman that values herself, it's the only thing that matters. "The only thing"? Why do you say that? Men turn their back on you the moment they satiate their appetite. Love is shame and horror when it's not blessed. You mean there's no love without marriage? Men hate love outside of marriage. Makes them feel shame, humiliation. I know that too well. You've always been locked up in this room... It's all the same. Outside, inside... Besides, love always dies. Only things remain. Rings, memories, dates... It's so hot in this room. We'll open the window and close the lattices. We'll have a beautiful summer storm. Murderer... Murderers. You. What are you doing here?. What you already done to her wasn't enough? You brought him here. I knew it. You and your deceitful smile. You swine. Get out. Out of this house. - We have to call a doctor. - She's dead. Nobody can now about this. Nobody. At least respect what's left of dignity in this house. Dignity? This is madness. You're all insane. - You've always been insane. - Why did you look for him? Murderer. You'll never forget this. You've gone too far this time. It wasn't enough for you to intrude. You had to stick your hand too. I'll take care of the burial. Inés lives in the US. Nobody has died in here. Please... I can't take this anymore. Get me out of here. The towels are in the wardrobe. Need anything else? Not for now, lovely. Forgive me. I'm a brute. Let's get out of here. You'll have a house. And I'll always visit you. I'll be a brother, a friend, whatever you want. Come on, let's go. I want you to have the best things. This will be your home. You'll have maids. You'll never lack anything. I'll always come to see you. I live mostly in Buenos Aires. It was all just a bad dream. You'll forget it.
