Shouldn't I be asking you that question? Maybe. So what was it? What you'd expect. He wants a relationship, I don't. Of course. What is that? Why is that in life when you don't wanna a relationship, you get countless offers? You are all about getting back into a relationship? You've just gotten out of a horrible one. I know, I know. But something kind of amazing happened last night. Hm. Miss positive hm. What happened? I met this old woman who told me that I was going to meet the love of my life before the end of the year. An old lady? Like a fairy godmother? Well, it's not like she did the whole bibbidi-bobbiti-boo thing, but you know, there was some sort of magic there. There was some magic. So she must have done a little salagadoola me chick a boola. You know I'm all about that. Wait, what are you doing? I am finally putting you on a dating app. Patrick, no. What do you think? Your soulmate's just gonna walk by the office? (door slamming) - Some old lady said this? - Yes. - That's so random. - Agreed. And then she handed me a cat. What, like an actual cat? Yep. And then she walked away. And you kept the cat. Well, I didn't want Whiskers to be all alone. You named her? Him. Okay, dude. Dude, dude, dude. I see this as a sign. I've been dying to set you up with my friend Hillary from the gym. Now I'm doing it. - Tonight? Totally. Tomorrow's the company picnic. It's like a day off anyways. You're gonna love Hillary. She's in great shape, really obsessed. Oh, you wanna do like a double date thing? You and Samantha? Nah, we don't do the normal date shit. We're just gonna stay home tonight and go through Craigslist. Craigslist? Please tell me you're looking for furniture. Well, if furniture is code for women that want three-ways, then yes. (Jack laughing) Wait, you're serious? You judge, but I am living the dream, bro. Samantha has an insatiable appetite for hooking up with women. She finds them on Craigslist, lures them in, and then bam, three-way. Living the dream. The dream in my pants. Yeah, oh, Hillary. No, I, uh, I was, I was reading an ad for jeans out loud. Those things are so stupid. Look, are you free tonight? Great. You're going on a blind date. You up for it? Perfect. Where do you wanna meet her? (intense rock music) Hillary? Hey, dude.

I'm sure you read that on my profile. I don't know if you had a chance to Wikipedia me, but you know, I didn't wanna be exposed on the dating sites and ruin my fan base. Your fan base? Ever since the reality shows. Reality shows? Yeah. All right, it all started when I had a few scenes on "Billionaire Matchmaker". I was one of the matches for the female billionaires. And then there was "Sexy Submarine". Is that the one where you have to serve naked on a submarine? Yes. And now I'm up for a new show. How do you top being naked on submarine?

Okay. I'm gonna go work out. Love you. I love you too. Yeah, I'm settling. Ron's not a rocket scientist, but look at him. Come on. You should see his dad. There's something in their genes.

Last night after the three-way action, she leaves, and when she gets home, she texts Samantha and I, "I made it home safe." Okay. Then she sends a nudie pic. Nice. No. See, we were asleep by then. So this morning when we wake up, we each have like 40 texts, each more psycho than the last, about how we used her and we're ignoring her now. I called that. She had crazy eyes. You gotta get out while you can. Oh, no way, man. That sex was epic. Like "Lawrence of Arabia" epic. Is that all it's about for you? That's like 90% of it, yeah. Anyways, we're bringing her to Ron's wedding. - Are you nuts? - What? You're, you're bringing your three-way sex toy to Ron's wedding? Well, he said it was fine. David. Of course he did. Ron is an idiot. We've known him since college. He's the nicest guy, but there's not much going on up there. Are we even sure he went to college with us? I never saw him go to class. He just stayed in the apartment. Honestly, I think he just thought living at the off-campus apartments with us meant he was going to college. Ah, now he's getting married. What the hell are you drinking, by the way? It's a protein shake my trainer put me on. Your trainer? I don't wanna talk about it. So who are you bringing to the wedding? I don't have a date yet. Let's fix that. Yeah. I can take care of myself. You should bring Vanessa's daughter. (ominous music) (man speaking German) So what's this movie? It's called (speaking German).

So 30 seconds. Tell me something about you. Well, I'm divorced. I work in IT. I used to teach ballroom dancing. I don't anymore, but I still love to go out dancing. Your turn.

I'm also bipolar. - You like to dance? - No. (bell ringing) Oh, one large popcorn, please. Ooh. Can we get some butter on that, please? Oh, no, wait. Two large popcorns. One no butter. Thank you. What, do you not like butter? It wouldn't be butter, it'd be diacetyl. Synthetic butter. When heated to high temperatures, diacetyl vaporizes and becomes toxic. Maybe they should have put that shit in "Breaking Bad". So what do you do? Um, I work for a software company, but I don't work directly for our software. I'm in the graphic design department. Oh, you don't have to apologize for that. Was I apologizing? I don't know. I mean, you didn't sound very proud of it. Thank you. (bell ringing) - [Woman] You've never been? To a sex party house? No, no. Here's what I'm saying. Couples get a discounted rate. We can go together as a couple, no strings attached. And then when we get there, we could bang whoever we want. And if you don't like the person, then we could just say your girlfriend or boyfriend doesn't approve. So look, if you're it, you just add your name to the list. "Christine's Bang Bang Party." Oh, it's at the Hotel Camelot. I had a baptism there once. (bell ringing) I've been dying to see this movie. They say it inspires and has a message at the same time. Can't wait. You having a good time? - Yeah. - Hm. (bell ringing) - Sagittarius. My ex was a Sag. Is that a good thing? - Well, yeah. - Thank God. Craig was such a strong foundation for me. He provided for me, took care of me, but I don't know. I guess I felt something was missing. I made a mistake. Slept with his brother. And that part he couldn't forgive. I want him back so bad. Craig? No, his brother. (bell ringing) (tense music) So sex after this, right? (actors speaking German) (bell ringing) - Well, I think we squeezed all we can outta these 30 seconds. I concur. I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. I would love to take this further. Me too. Okay. Quick, before they ding us off. Let me get your number. Here. I'll put it in your phone. Okay.

So Ron, where's your father? He is right over there. He's 75. Hi. How are you? Hi. You gotta be kidding me. Guys, you didn't wear your tuxes? Hello, hello. Sorry, sorry I'm late. Sorry, Amy, Ron, hello. Father Mitchell, and hello to everyone else. I'm never gonna remember all of your names. So I know you're dying to get to the rehearsal dinner. I'll make this as quick and painless as I possibly can, all right? Your Honor, I am so sorry that everybody didn't dress up. You don't dress up for the rehearsal, Ron. But goddamn, you look handsome. Amy! And Ron, let's go ahead and get you two in the middle here. And let's have the women of the bridal party line up to Amy's left, the groomsmen to Ron's right. There we go. We settled? Fantastic. Okay. So the bridal party will come down one by one and they'll arrive and assemble right here. And we don't need to rehearse that, do we? No, sir. Okay. And I'm to understand that Ron's father will be walking Amy down the aisle, which would be you. Yes. Ben Davis. Perfect. He's 75. Wow. Really? Okay, Ben, go ahead and you walk her down. You will arrive here. Once you arrive here, you will hand Amy to Ron, and then you will go ahead and take your seat on the aisle. Well, I actually wanted my mother to walk with my Nana first. We should practice that one. Mom, where's Nana? She's in the bathroom. Fine. Let's just move on. Amy. We can't get married without your Nana here. Ron. This is not the wedding. This is the rehearsal. My sparkling butterfly, are you getting cold feet? Tomorrow is the wedding. Jesus Christ. Amy! Who the hell cleans this place? These bathrooms are a shithole. (Amy laughing) (glass clinking) Everyone. I just wanted to say a few words before we got started. You know, rehearsal dinners are so very special. Well, not just for the wedding party, but for our closest of closest of friends. And we all know that my husband, Amy's dad Charlie, is, is here with us, watching over us right now. So Amy, Ron, tomorrow is going to be, oh, now what do you kids call it? Epic. Tomorrow is going to be epic, because your dad is gonna be right here with us pulling all the right strings. Hear, hear! Oh, cheers. Cheers. (glasses clinking) I love you, Mom. I love you too, baby. Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat, let's eat, let's eat, let's eat, let's eat. I'm hungry. Oh, that poor kid is about his eating. You know, Charlie may not have been her real father. (all gasping) (mellow music) Hi, I'm Jill. Gabe. Nice to meet you. Likewise. You ready for tomorrow? After Ron's bachelor party, I think I'll be ready for anything. Drinks? Sure. I was gonna get a martini. You? I love martinis. Awesome. Let's go. (energetic music) Whoo! So, you wanna do the geek dance again tonight? Ah, nah, not that it wasn't fun, but it just didn't lead to any hookups for me. If it did, he'd want to do it every night. No, I'd go geek 24/7. Some girl was looking for you that night. Wait, what did she look like? She was gorgeous. Oh, come on. You're just telling me this right now? You left so quickly, what could I do? I forgot about it. Look, Jack, sometimes something is set in motion and you may never find out the results. What does that mean? Like, say the girl that saw you dance that night is your soul mate. That would mean you're destined to bump into her again. You sound just like that crazy old lady on the bridge, On the bridge? I thought you said he went to a fortune-teller. No, some lady ran into him on Lake Avenue. And said he was gonna meet the love of his life in five days? - Yes. (laughing) Her name's Cecile. She's demented. She tells everyone that. Tries to give them a cat too. Whiskers? You took the cat? Never take the cat! That's a thing? Oh, come on. So you in this entire week where I've had some of the crappiest dates of my life, it's been leading up to nothing? We don't know that yet. Maybe it's all destiny. Yeah, I'm thinking it's all bullshit. Can we get another round of shots, please? Tonight's the night, Jack. We are finding your soul mate. Yeah? Yes. I'm 100% focused. Hang on. Are you guys having fun tonight? (crowd cheering) What is she doing? Some of you guys might have been here last week when I had this geek with me and we surprised everyone and won the dance contest. Who saw that? Oh no, no. Please tell me she's not doing this. Well, that geek's here again tonight and surprise surprise, he ain't no geek. He's hot and he's single, ladies. (crowd cheering) Too much? And then I told him, "You take out the dry cleaning~" (laughing) I just love that so much. He loves that story. Oh, sweetie, look at your hands. Aw. They look so happy together. Really? (upbeat music) I love this song. Wanna dance? Yeah. I would love that. ♪ I heard you singing from the balcony ♪ You ready for this? Yeah. ♪ 'Cause you're my baby ♪ Easy, tiger, slow down. What, you can't handle these moves? I don't think anyone can handle these moves. Oh, are you, are you okay? So have you ever traveled? Tons of places. I used to travel the world for ballroom dance competitions. Oh, wow. Do you dance? No, not really. Well, have you ever traveled? No, unfortunately, but I want to. Well, maybe we could travel together someday. I would like that. ♪ Got a few things I could a told your parents about ♪ What's so funny? Nothing. Just some good friends. Oh yeah, Samantha. She's like the MC here or something, right? Yep. She called you out earlier. She did. Well, I'm happy she did. Otherwise how would we have met? To Samantha. To Samantha. This is gonna sound nuts, but sometimes I like to just go with the flow. Okay. I love doing that. All right. Well, tomorrow I have a wedding to go to. It's a friend I've known for years and I don't have a date. Would you like to go with me? I would. Fantastic. - I love weddings. - Me too. Have you ever been married? You know, I didn't think you were gonna come forward like that on that move. Really? Even after the way you yanked me towards you like that? I guess when you put it that way. Apology accepted. Hey. I'm sorry, okay? Are you two brother and sister? No. Oh, okay. Probably cousins. Ah, beautiful bride. Awkward. Hey, can we start over? Sure. Hi, my name's Gabe. I'm Jill. It's a pleasure to meet you, sis. So it didn't end well? How many divorces do? Are you happier now? I am. Well, that's all that matters. How about you? You ever been married? No. God, no. All right. Let's lighten it up. Can I ask you a few questions? Yes, officer. Let's see. What's your favorite movie? Um, I like "Frozen". All right. Who's your favorite musician? Selena Gomez. All right. What's your favorite TV show? I like "Fuller House". Wait, how old are you? I just turned 21. How about you? You know. I mean, it doesn't matter to me. Age is like, totally a state of mind. I agree. Okay. So how old are you? I'm 42. Okay. So when I was born, you were already of legal drinking age. Hey, you two. You guys look like couple of the night from where I'm standing. Yeah. We're having a good time. So anything crazy about you that Jack should know? What? I figured I'd get it out of the way. I mean, I did stab my last boyfriend. (Samantha and David laughing) (lighthearted music) May I help you, buddy? Yes. Hi. I'm here to pick up a suit. Jack Fisher. And you, bro? I'm here to pick up a suit as well. Patrick Dewitt. The Davis wedding on New Year's Eve? - Same. - Huh. You two together? Uh, yeah. I'm Jack. I'm Patrick. Are you friends with the bride or the groom? I've known Amy for years and years. Ron's been my friend a long, long time. You look really familiar. Yeah, I was gonna say the same thing. Here you go, butt buddies. (lighthearted music) Do you work, you work for AES. - I do. - You do, right? - Yes. - Ah, that's it. I knew I wasn't crazy. How are you two paying for this? I don't know. How do you wanna pay for this, honey? You wanna split it this time? Yes, darling. Here you go, dear. Such a gentleman. Now I know who the girl is. Pansies. I don't know if you're snorting too much dry cleaning fluid lately, but I'm gonna tell you something. If it wasn't for butt buddies and pansies, you wouldn't even have a business, 'cause most of the clothes that you clean are designed by butt buddies and pansies. And by the way, your business is named after a gay bar. Let's go. (upbeat music) You look lost. Oh yeah. Cards are like, not my thing. Do you work here? No, I am actually card-shopping as well. Oh, I can't seem to find the right one. All I see are Christmas cards. Oh, what are you looking for? A wedding card. Oh, me too. Whose wedding? My friend Amy. Marrying Ron? Yes. I'm the maid of honor. Oh yeah, that's just great. Ron's an old college buddy of mine. Yeah. I'm David, by the way. Jill. So random. Or maybe not. Yeah, my girlfriend gave me some parameters on the type of card to get. Oh. Oh yeah. I have a girlfriend. Sorry? No, no, it's, trust me. I was expecting something to not go right. Why? Um, it's a long story. Oh, tell it quickly. Put it all in one fast sentence. Okay. This week has been nuts. I've been on five of the worst dates ever. I was told I'm gonna meet the love of my life. I want to meet the love of my life. And this week has assured me that that is never going to happen. Okay. I think I got it all. Impressive. Wait a minute. I know you. You do? We met at the Track. My girlfriend's the MC. It was dark. - Yeah. Yeah. I remember. - Yeah. I remember, you were looking for... Jill, do you dance? Yes. I think I may have solved your problem already. I believe I have the perfect guy for you. Hang on. Do you have like 30 minutes to stop by Casa Vega down the street? So my dating life lately has been a little, um... Precarious. That's why I'm saying you need to meet my friend Jill. She's going through the same thing. Are you bringing a date to the wedding? Yeah. You? Sand to the beach? Never. Weddings bring out the gays like a parade. So who are you bringing? Some girl I met at the club the other night. You don't seem very excited about it. I'm not, unfortunately. I think you need to meet Jill before tonight. But she'll be at the wedding. Yeah. She's the maid of honor. Mm. Is she bringing a date? No, that's what I'm getting at here, Jack. You might be able to upgrade before it's too late. I couldn't. I mean, maybe. I don't know. It's not that my current date is horrible or anything. It's just that she's not the one. Well, yeah, I was gonna say potential psychotic, but you know, not the one works as well. You are too cute to be ignored. I'm gonna send you to my buddy's restaurant down the street. It's called Roar. It's the hottest gay bar in town. Very, very charming and Jill loves the place. It's not open yet because the gays don't come out of the coffin til the sun goes down. But you go there and I will have Jill meet you. I'd go with you, but I have to run to a meeting. Are you okay with going to a gay bar by yourself? I think I can handle it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna text my buddy Hank, the manager. Let him know you're coming. Go there, find him, introduce yourself, and I'll send Jill. I don't know. Come on. What have you get to lose? (laughing) What could go wrong? Hi, this is Jack. Sorry I missed your call, but I'd really love to talk. He won't answer his phone. Did you try texting him? No. Is that a thing? Hm, funny. You got a picture of your buddy? Yeah. You actually saw him once. - I did? - Yeah. Let me just, I'm trying to find the best pic, then I'll explain. Um, David? I need to ask you a question. I think I know what that question is. Was that former WWE champion Olympic gold medalist Kurt Angle? Yes, I believe so. Was he just checking me out? Yes, I believe so. Hm. (crowd chatting indistinctly) Hi. Hello. Are you Hank? Yeah, that's me. Patrick sent me. My name's Jack. Oh, Patrick. Where is he, in the back? Oh no, no, no, he's not here. Okay, sure. (laughing) Um, er. The place seems kind of busy. Do you have an event or something coming up tonight? Right, right, you haven't been here before. I know, okay. No, this is my first time. Yeah, sure. Okay. Um, Patrick told me to talk to you. I'm supposed to meet to a, uh. All right. Quit the act. I knew it all along. Come on, get going, let's see what you got. Oh God, is this a flash mob?

I was just supposed to introduce myself and then I was supposed to meet a friend. Who? Never mind. Who are you? Nice club. Who is, who are you? What are you doing here? What, who is that guy? Who are you? So yeah, that kind of goes along with my week. The most insane shit is happening to me. Like what? Like predictions, bad dates, worse dates, famous wrestlers coming in and staring at me and walking away. Hmm. I've been there. You're fun, David. Oh, well, if you like me, you're gonna love Jack. Oh, that reminds me of the picture. Let me just, oh, here's a good one. (lighthearted music) Hi. (lighthearted music) What the hell is going on, Jill? Right? Okay, that is Kurt Angle, right? Checking you out. Yes. And he just, he, he, he just walks away. He just nods his head. And the other guy gave you the thumbs up? Yeah. Okay, wait, should I go talk to him? (phone ringing) Oh, hang on. This is Jack. Hey, buddy. You, wait, what, you're where? Wait, what did you ruin? Isn't that cool? Uh, hang on Jack. Hi. Hi. (lighthearted music) I'll call you back. What? What is happening? Okay. This is the strangest thing, right? He, he won't talk to me. He's, okay. That's it. Oh my God. What? (lighthearted music) Oh. - Yeah. My life just hit a new low. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's probably new. It's a nice picture though, right? (somber music) Hey. - Hey, it's you. - Yeah. How did it go over at Roar? What happened? Um, how close are you to Hank? Oh my God. What, what do you mean? Um, never mind. I'm assuming I'm on the wrong side? Yeah. The groom's side is over there. Okay. What was that about? Uh, well, it involved a flash mob, an engagement, and um, miscommunication, I guess. Okay. Dude, after all the texts I sent, I didn't think you guys were gonna make it. Well, you know how long it takes women to get ready. Yeah. Okay. He took 25 minutes on his hair. Where's Vanessa? A little drama. No biggie. Who the hell's Vanessa? ("Wedding March") (phone ringing) Dude, you just became that guy. That's never happened to me before. All guys say that at some point. They have pills for that. Funny. It'll never happen. What about at Christine's Bang Bang Party? Wait, you guys were at Christine's Bang Bang Party? We are gathered here today to celebrate the union of Amy and Ron. We are privileged to witness the joyous love of a new family. A new family, a family that is nurtured and nourished through the devotion of two separate individuals that grow together through the common bonds of love. May their marriage bring the peace, joy, comfort, and contentment that's found in the hearts of all God's children. Now, the vows that you exchange here today are a verbal representation of the emotions that are just as real as anything that can be seen. Who are you looking at? Heard or touched, for it's not the words that you speak today that will bond you together as one but the strength and commitment found deep within your souls. Now, before we begin, is there anyone here who objects to this union? Speak now or forever hold your peace. Anyone? Jesus Christ. What the hell is he waiting for? [All] Cheers!

Happy New Year. Same to you. So you're here for the wedding? Yeah. I'm one of Ron's old friends. Yeah. I'm, I'm the- The maid of honor. Yeah. You were at the ceremony? Yes, but I, I didn't see you there. I was right up on stage. Oh, there was this tall guy. Yeah. Actually, I saw him too. I guess it was just bad timing. I'm Jack. I'm Jill. Nice to meet you, Jill. It's nice to meet you, Jack. So are you having fun tonight? Ah, it's been a strange night. (chuckling) For me too. God, the whole week's been strange, actually. Yeah, me too. All right. You go first. Why has it been a strange week? Okay, let's see. I, uh, I went on a bunch of dates that all ended on a scale from horrible to insanely horrible. What? For me too. I, I, I, this, this whole past week has been one epic date fail after the next one. Really? You're serious? Swear to God. I mean, it all started after I met this crazy old gypsy cat lady on a bridge and she told me- That you're gonna be the love of your life in five days? Yes. Yeah. This is getting weird. Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. How do you know the old lady? Well, I met her too. She told me the same thing. And you took the cat? (laughing) No, of course not. I'm the only, I'm the only one. Still, so random. Yeah, well, before you freak out, I found out that like she tells everybody that. That's her thing. Oh, well, I was the one that got suckered into it. Guess I was too. So what do you do, Jack? I work for a software company. Me too. Wait, Application Enhancement Solutions? Yes. Okay, yeah. This is getting weird. Agreed. Wait, how have I not met you before? Missed connections? You ever hear the dark side of the moon theory, that there's this whole alien civilization living on the other side of the moon, but we never see them 'cause we're only looking at this side? - No, I haven't. - It makes no sense. We have satellites and photos and... You're absolutely beautiful. Thank you, Jack. So what's next, huh? How does this end? Okay, wait, let me guess. You are married, two kids, and you live on a different continent. Divorced, single, no kids. And I live on this continent, but trust me, I'm not getting my hopes up. Let's see. Your ex was a drug kingpin who swore that he was gonna kill the next guy that you dated. Something like that, maybe? - Close. - I figured. Yeah, no, no, no. I'm single. I have never been married. (soft music) Wanna take a walk? Yeah. (romantic music) (romantic music continues) And the girl gets up on the bar. And she literally jumped off when nobody was there to catch her. You didn't catch her? I wasn't ready! Hey, there's my maid of honor. Oh my God. I am so sorry. It's fine. It's fine. I had to mingle around, you know how weddings are. - Hey, buddy. - Hey, Ron. Congrats, you two. Oh my God. I'm so glad that you two met. I've been trying to introduce you since that night. Wait, wait, wait, wait. This is the guy that you called? You hung up on me. I swear I didn't. My phone died. I plugged it in and charged it and then I called you. I left a message. Did he? I've just been so busy. Let me hold on. [Jack] Hey, Ron, bro, broski. Uh, hey, man. I, I just wanted to leave this message 'cause my phone died and I'd really love to talk to that girl, but I, I'm not desperate or anything. I just thought that maybe, you know what? Forget it. I'm going to sleep. Gimme a call when you get this message. Okay, then. We'll talk then. Sounds great, buddy. Oh my God. But you're so damn hot. Dark side of the moon. It's the dark side of the moon, yes, yes. Listen, you guys have gotta come in for the last dance. Uh, no thanks. Yeah. I, we should just stay out here. Are you nuts? It's my goddamn wedding. And you two are gonna come and dance, damn it. Yeah, buddy. You gotta do it. I'll see you inside. I guess we gotta go dance. Are you friends with the bride? Yeah. I noticed that you're wearing a ring. - Yeah. - Are you married? No, I'm not married. So why do you wear a ring? Because I, because I need to keep certain men away sometimes. - Yeah, it doesn't work. - Oh, all right. You're making me very anxious. Good. Because you're very attractive. Well, thank you.
