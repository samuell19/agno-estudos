Pepper, we have a new group of ladies. Please have more temperament, okay? Why pretend? University student. School seems very far away from me. I can't tutor her any longer, ok?

I'm going to chase her, but as you see, she can't stay away from me. It's you that can't stay away from her. Right, stick together. I tell that, she's lived abroad. And is now a reporter. Pretends to be classy. May be you are wrong this time I think she's got depth. What do you know? You have to trick girls like her. Trick her harder. If you really like her, why trick her?

No one knows, not even him. You two are good friends. We went to the academy together. We work and get off work together. Sleep together, play together. I cook and he eats, I take care of him. I'm like his mother. I think he's strange. - Strange? - Right. Actually we're both a little strange. That's why we are the best partners, right? You're very normal. He is too, but since we're little.

What is it? How's Curry? Still critical, go take a look at him. Why did you do that for? Wanted me to feel bad the rest of my life? You're not going to leave me, are you? You know we haven't pay our rent this month. I know I'm cruel. I'll apologize now. Did you hear me... You're crying... Hey, you're tricking me... Stupid, I'm wearing bullet proof vest. This is your first day as a cop? The killer shot at him, not us. People saw you two running around shooting. Called to complaint for 6 hours straight. Who would take the blame? Anna, give me a glass of water. Is this your first day as the director? How did you train your brothers? Sorry, Inspector, sorry. My undercover man is dead. You ruined everything. Who should take the blame? Just let us take the blame. We tried so hard to stay away from Dog. Used all our strength. Who would know the followed us? And got kill, how can we not do anything? That's right. Do you have a flower on your shoulder? You're not qualified to talk to me. Say nothing. Shut up. Write me a report right away. Yes sir. Give you two one week vacation. We're fine, boss.

You told us to stay away. He's so ugly, careful you'll have nightmares. Everyone come over here, good show... Looks good on the camera Sure, needless to say. I was talking about Curry. No, Pepper is better looking. Pepper. Of course you would say that. Don't worry, just look. Aunt Ho. Hello, who is it? Ok, see you later. Ignore this, understand! Come on, it was a joke. Who is she, why were you on her side? I have a date. Who with? An old classmate. Tell her not to watch T.V. Hello, hello... What a coincidence! Not really, I live across form here. Did you forget? I live across from here too. Really... Your girlfriend called. Said she'll come on Valentine's Day. His girlfriend is very nice. I have to go now. What do you mean? What? That's why you don't have hemorrhoid anymore. You're cured. Old classmate? You're so naive. Do you know that? You're wearing my broken shoes. Did you sleep with her? Forgot to wipe your mouth. How will you face your girlfriend in Canada? You told me to break up with her. I didn't tell you to pull my leg. Why would Mimi like you? She's rich and powerful, she's just playing. Why would she fall in love with you? This is my own business. Chicken man. You like to be soft, ok? Watch your words. For real? Do I look I'm joking? I'm not kidding neither, give my cloths back. I bought it myself. - The belt is yours. - Give it back. The cloth is mine. Shoes are mine. Underwear too. How could you be so clear cut. Everything in this house is mine. I've been taking care of you for so long. I never forced you. You like to cook for me and do the laundry. What was I suppose to do? Fine, stop it. You can have them back. Your underwear, wash it yourself. You've worn it, I don't want it. What $700? You owe me $700, give it back. $700 Still owe you $400. You're serious? Never talk to me again. I know you are still available When I was small, I loved to collect shell Really? Have you ever seen the glowing shell? You are lier. Yes, I was grown in Lamma Island When the sun rises All shells in the beach are shinning Really? What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing Wait and see if you are lying Lying? - It will be long - I don't care You handled Mimi so easily. You'll get any body you want? Be careful. You have the right not to believe. It's my own business, not yours. You're not being very sanitary. Accept reality, it's cruel. I don't think so. No other way. It's a fact that High Mimi is mine. I'm going to ask for a new partner. What? Why change partners? Because I don't think he has any class. I think he has a lot of class. But he's diseased, I can't help it. He has V.D. Great, you're a great match. You won't have a new partner. Druggy... Curry, Pepper, I haven't sell for a long time. I won't go anywhere. I'm 1/2 second faster than you. I got him first. You tell him, say it. The time is the same. What do you mean? I was faster, is that the same? Pepper, don't do this. Tell him I cuffed you first. And I'll let you go. Tell him I was first, I'll get a car for you. I don't trust cops, take me to the station. Out! Don't pull, I'm going to fall apart. Follow me. Follow me. Take whatever you want. I don't want something you don't want. Curry, Pepper. I don't believe anything the cops say. I'm not leaving. When did I become a vegetarian? Why don't you give me a banana? Right, I brought a banana for you. Eat it after your meal. What do you mean? Don't be wrong, Curry has a very rich girlfriend. You should be happy for him. Take your time, I show you my girl friend's picture. I met this model in Guangzhou. I told her, I'm a Gold Finger in Hong Kong. She wanted to marry me right away. I think she heard it wrong. Thought I make gold rings. She must misunderstood. So, even though Curry has High Mimi, you'll probable turn into Bruce Lee. OK, don't lose faith. Even you have a girlfriend. Ten, be honest. Am I really disgusting? Disgusting? No really, just a bit. You're god damn too honest. I have to find something meaningful to do. Not have to, you should. Then good. Find the person that killed Dog. Find him right away. I'm not working undercover any longer. I'm going to study law, become a lawyer. Live a real life with my wife. You'll need money to marry a wife. I said I'm not working undercover. Unless you give me $20 thousand. It's not the money, it's the principle. $15 thousand or forget it. I won't work for less than $10 thousand. Fine, $10 thousand. $8500 and start right away. - Happy Birthday. - Thanks, Mary. Happy Birthday. Thanks, why did you come so late? Close your eyes. What is it? You bought it? I made it just for you. Really? Joey, happy birthday. Tony. This is for you, like it? Pretty, thank you. Sorry I'm late, there's a little traffic. It's okay, this is Tony, Gary. Hi, how are you... Please to meet you. Hello. I've seen you somewhere before? At Oxford University? No, no, you're mistaken. Then it must be Cambridge? I think you have the wrong man, Tony right? I don't think we ever met. Gary, this is my friend. Hi. This is impossible. Tony, people are waiting for you over there. I've seen her. Are you really a cop? Yes. Do the cops take bribes? Do me a favor. If you ever see me in my red Farrari, the one with 38's on the plate, don't give me a ticket. Excuse me... USC, USC class of 82, definitely. Just let me think about it, okay? Coming. Sorry, Inspector Ma. You're here too? Don't cops work 24 hours a day? I'm sick. And you're drinking? None of your business. You... I remember, Camton College. I saw you on the school paper, right? I didn't go to college. Shit you. No class at all. What? Are you mad at them? I'm mad at them? They're making fun of me. They're just joking around. I'm a cop, they think I'm strange. I don't. Your cloths don't go with the tie I gave you. Just the tie? And a lot of other things. Hey, what's wrong? Don't speak English to me. - Sorry. - It's my fault. Joey, come cut the cake. Come in with me. You go ahead, I'm leaving. Gary, please. Pepper must feel very alone at home. I should go home. Will you call me? I'll call you. Wait till I finish cutting the cake? Wait for me. It's for you. Hello. Who is it? Didn't say. Man or woman? Didn't say. Didn't say anything? How did you know it's for me? I don't know, I guessed. Why touch my book? Let me play the cross word puzzle. You can read? Basically if a man falls out of love, puzzles and poems are what he should do. If you want you can have it. Out of love? I'm not like you. Differences in character. Go to hell. You can scream, you're king tonight. Ever thought about changing profession. Become a sweeper? You can never clean up all the garbage. Like cops never finish catching bad guys. I don't get it. What is one day the sweepers don't sweep? There will be garbage everywhere. You're right. So sweepers have to sweep, we catch bad guys. And continue to be a cop. What about brother? You decide, you're the king. Come... hurry, follow me. A lot of guests are waiting for you. Shit, taking so long for make-up. Remember, if the guests pay too little, you will tell them it's too little. Too few. Not little, it's few. It's little. It's hard to curse. Remember, you're 1203, 1204, 1205. Anything goes wrong, come to me, ok? Go up, the guests are waiting. Never mind this sad face, looks like a hooker. Be smart, hear? Hello, call 619. Yes, Ten is looking for him. Tell him to come to Pacific Hotel, thank you. Let's go to Aunt Ho. It's your temper I'm afraid of. Ten called, the killer is in Pacific Hotel. Thank you sir. Don't go, don't go. He didn't pay for the women and room. You guys be the judge. White plays for free? Pay the money and leave. I don't want U.S. Dollar, I want H.K. Dollar. I don't feel like exchanging the money, pay... Alright, I'll take your luggage for deposit. Come here. That's my dad. Baby, stop the car. Why would tat fatso have my picture? It must be the cops, go finish them. No, forget about the deal. Go to High Sea. Coward. Turtle son. Our men. Officer, found this on the dead body. Alright, all of you go back. Where is Ten? Tell me. Ten has two wedding invitations. This time he's serious? Why are you guys so nosy? Our Inspections have everything arranged. Prepared to get the guys tonight? There are other ways. Shut up. They'll definitely cancel this time. Call off their duties. But... Careful I call off your duty too. You shut up! You shut up too! You shut up three! I quit. Me too. Don't be so impulsive. What kind of an attitude is this? High officials like yourself. Have no right talking to small cops like us. You... Who, who, who, who what? I've endured this for a long time. I'm Director Chou, they're my men. They're my business, not yours. You two stop working for a while. Hello, yes. Here's the $10 thousand I owe you. Ten, I drink to you. Have some. Hello. I don't know. Everyone's at the dock. Go back to the station. Mad dog. Where's the gun? Gave them back to the force. What should we do? Why are you so nervous? Come on, let's go. The back door. Jump, hurry. Ok. Hello, you're crazy. No, if he comes, we're dead. You'll die if you jump. No I won't. We might not lose. Pepper, hurry and jump. I say no and I won't jump. Pepper, he's coming. Say no more. Curry, I'm leaving. You're tricking me again. Pepper. Curry. Mr. Chen isn't back yet? Then we have to leave first. Pepper, come over here, hurry. - Move fast. - What's the matter. Where is the key for the gun cabinet? Right here. Wait, you're really going to marry me? I'm very serious. My mom can start arranging the wedding? Yes, but not too much. About 200 tables will be enough. You be careful. What are you doing? Go through the back. Not going to the dock? Are you kidding? Then what are we doing here? Anna asked the officials for us. Ships will dock at 17. The ship has an "L" on the chimney. Find. It's 4:00, where's the ship? Should be here soon. Look, it that it? Big brother. Put it there. I want to stay in HongKong. You can leave now. Freeze all of you. Police. General, something's wrong. Chou, go take a look. Yes. - Right in front of me. - Behind me. Go up. I told you not to mess with that cop. I'm sending you back to mainland. Coward, trying to mess everything? You just killed a lot of men, you know that? I didn't even shoot. I didn't either. Oh no! You almost killed me. They're exchanging bullets. See who's faster. No more bullets. I'm telling you. I really killed a lot of people. Right I did too. That's such a big ship, how many are there? 70 or 80 men. I only have a few bullets left. That means I have to kill 3 with every bullet. Here, let's stay here for now. What did you say? Coward? What about Ten? What are we doing here? Why are you telling me all this? You know I loyal to my friends. Fuck you Fang, you come out here. Just kidding. Did he follow you? How would I know? Did you hear foot steps? I only heard your heard beat. You have more suggestions, think fast. You're better than I. You are better, hurry and think. You have more tricks. Forget it, let's go up first. Curry, I got him. Pepper. You think only you wear bullet proof vest. Shit you're full of it. We're on the highest floor. Really, any higher? Shit, this is my last roll of bullets. I only have 6 left. He's coming. Are you ready? Yes, go. Did you get him? I think I missed. I have only one bullet left. And I have only two left. I'll count to 3 and we'll go out. 1, 2 Wait, should we rehearse again? 1, 2, 3 I think we got him. Is he dead? He was fine on the last shot. He got shot 3 times this time. Right, he should be dead. He's still alive? Are you sure? No more bullets. Pepper. Go to hell. Go to hell... It's okay, I have one more bullet. Hold still, I'll be right back. Shit, this isn't the right one. Got it. Pepper, we're fine now. I know we've done something to be proud of. This will shake the whole world. What do you think. I think she'll call me tomorrow night. And come back to me. Shut up, I think she'll marry me. Idiot, she's never loved you before. If she know I killed Dog, she'll love me. I wounded him severely. Bull shit, fuck you. Come on, the hell with you. Shut your mouth, shut up...
