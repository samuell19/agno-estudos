- Go ahead. It's easier than you think. [gun fires] [police sirens blare] [melancholy music] - [Lara] We found the body. - Congratulations. - Act of revenge for what he did? - You have nothing on me. - We've got plenty. - If he's dead, I had nothing to do with it. - Bullshit. You left him to die. We have enough evidence to put you away. [somber music] But life changes in a second. - [Tom] You come from the province. - I grew up there with my sister Jinky. We were happy there, for the most part. Papa drank too much. And when he's drunk, well, it wasn't that pretty. - [Pierre] Hear that baby crying? Reminds me of you. I'm gonna give you all of this. You have to be able to run it. Being old Nelly motherfucker closet queen is not gonna get it done. - [Das] Okay, Pops, okay. - [Pierre] If there was a family in the province, and you know their name, that was late, could you figure out what to do on your own? - Yes. [grunts in pain] That's not enough money! Don't gamble what you can't afford. Somebody's gotta pay it back. [melancholy music] - [Sandra] So Jinky decided to go to Manila and find work. You don't wanna go, do you? - No. But someone has to work to pay off Daddy's debts. - [speaks foreign language] - Ah, Maria Garcia's doing it again. - Yeah, she's so beautiful. I wish I had her life. Jinks. - Hm? - Take me with you. - No. You finish your studies first. - But Manila's so beautiful. You get a lot of opportunities there, the job the money-- - No. [solemn music] - [Sandra] And she was the oldest, so the responsibility fell on her to pay off the debt. [baby cries] I wish she had never gone. Life in the province was hard, but it was nothing compared to the city. [police sirens blare] My mother found Jinky a job. She got an old friend who work as a cleaner in a hospital. The pay was poor, but it was more than we could earn in the province. - We'll just file this, and we'll just call you, okay? - [Sandra] But she made friends. She told me about this guy, a real nice guy. - Hey, do you need help? - No, it's okay. - I'm Edward. - I'm Jinky. - Are you new here? - Yes, I've been living here for a week now. I work as a cleaner in the F wing. - I work there too, as a porter. I've seen you around. - I'm really lucky to have this job. My family needs money. - Look, if you're not, if you don't have a boyfriend and you need someone to take you around the city-- - It's okay. I have to go. My shift starts in 10 minutes. - Hey Jinky. You wanna pay back the money your father owes, you're not gonna make it working that job. The golden ticket. [somber music] Call me. - The money wasn't enough. Cleaners don't earn much. So she needed to find a second job. Once she decided she'd become a dancer, her mind was made up. Jinky's always like that. Very stubborn. The second job meant working at nights. [melancholy music] That's when she saw the fat man. To work in the clubs, every girl has to see the fat man. - Off. Off. Okay, you'll work Thursday, Friday, Saturday. - So what was it like being a celebrity? - I wasn't a celebrity, just an up-and-coming TV host. - You still think you're a star. - [Che] It was a previous life, previous time. - And what happened? I'll tell you what happened, you were set up. At a Christmas party. All the executives there, they raped your friend, each and every one of them. And then they just left her there, just lying there. You threatened to expose them, threatened to go to the press. I bet they didn't like that very much, did they? - That night it all changed. They acted quickly. They froze my bank accounts. Give me my son. They paid my husband. I want my son. They took my son. I lost my child, my career. I was homeless. - [Lara] So where's your son now? - [Che] They took him away. Okay, I'll do it. - [chuckles] Well done, son. She stays here and works for us. She's fucked. It is a beautiful country, where women and children are cheaper than cigarettes. - Even my parents refused to help. Hi, it's me. I thought you would've helped. But I have no one else. Well fuck you, too. [melancholy music] - The problem was, she needed somewhere else to live. They said, "A lady's boarding house is no place "for a stripper who works at night." ♪ Watch over me ♪ I pray ♪ Direct my feet ♪ Along the way ♪ And through storms ♪ May I pass untroubled ♪ Safe in my savior's arms ♪ Today [knocking] - Hi. - Sorry babe, but I need this apartment. - I can't afford anywhere else. Where I stay now, they have a strict curfew, and I plan to work at night. - Come in. Sorry about the mess, you guys. I'm Rommy. - Jinky. - Michelle, but I prefer Che. - Australian? - Sometimes. - You're American? - Well, my father was an American soldier that was stationed here. Met my mom, knocked her up, moved back to the States, where I was raised as an Army brat. But my mom passed away when I was 16 and my father remarried this 18 year old white whore. Next thing you know, I'm given $1,000 and a one way ticket here. I didn't even speak the language. But nonetheless, I'm a survivor and I'm a hooker. So if you don't wanna stay here... - I don't mind. - Yeah, I have a son I want back. - Great. Well, it'll be a tight squeeze, but I'm sure we can work something out. - And who is she? - She was a prostitute. But she was also my best friend. Born a woman in a man's body. - [Tom] Life was hard. - Yeah. By moving out of the hospital accommodation, she could work at night as a stripper. - So Jinky was a cleaner by day and a stripper by night? - Yes. She got a job at a bar.

Tick tock, tick tock. - I'm trying, I'm really trying. - Tick tock, tick tock. - 250,000 pesos is a lot of money. - You're a smart girl, I'm sure you can think of something. [sighs] [electronic club music] - And then I met him. - You do understand we're in this business to make money, right? Okay, let's try this again. Let's engage, let's be proactive, shall we? - Yes. - Don't be sorry, fix your shit. - They paid him to keep an eye on me, to make sure I didn't say anything. They used my son as leverage to work. An ex-celebrity is worth a lot in this town. - That was great, baby, can I see you again? - Yeah, baby. Whatever. [foreboding music] - Michelle Alonzo. It's a real name, isn't it? Fancy you with a drug habit. - I don't do drugs. - It's not very often I got someone as famous as you in here. - They're not mine. - Yeah, so you say. Maybe we can come to some kind of an arrangement. [zipper opens] - The police take me in from time to time with fake drug charges. - He'd be at the back of the hospital waiting every Friday. - Why every Friday? - That was payday. [somber music] - Hey. Excuse me. Hey! [snaps fingers] - [Sandra] That's when she decided that she had to pay the money back quicker. - We all have a price. You, me, everybody. We decided what the price tag was going to be. Don't trust anyone, ever. [horn honks] - Michelle, we got another cab out here. [solemn music] Hey.

[snaps fingers] [phone rings] Hello? - [Man] It's done, he's dead. - [Che] I heard his father was killed in the street. - Fuck. Here. Let's do it again sometime, shall we? [somber music] - [Tom] And how did you get into the picture? - Dad drank more and more. He became violent. And then one night, he came into my room. Drunk. He must have thought I was Jinky. - Hey, Jinky. How was your weekend? - Hi Edward, it was good. I spent time with family and ate, told stories. - Yeah, I did the same, too. - Jinky Santos, you have phone call. Remember, no phone calls allowed. - Look, I'm not sure if you have any plans for this Thursday night. - Edward, wait, I have to accept this phone call first. Wait, and I'll... - Okay, that's okay. - Hello? San. I know. What? - I couldn't bear it anymore. His hands. His breath. - No, no, no, no, stay there, stay there. No, San, stay there, I'm coming home. Okay, bye bye. - I needed her. She's my sister. She came. [melancholy music] - Is this what you do when I'm not here? - Getting drunk? - Do you have any idea what I have to do to get that money? Do you have any idea? Do you even care about your children? San! [phone beeps] - [Che] Rommy had a regular she liked. She was lucky, he liked her. - So next thing you know, they're both at my front door. I couldn't just let them both leave. - I think it's very honorable of you, taking them in. - Yeah. Why? - What? - Why me? There are a million girls in the city, and I do mean girls. - I don't know, there's something in your eyes. But I do know that I like you. [phone rings] Hello. Yeah. Right, alright, I'll be there. I gotta go. - Cool. - Can I call you later? - Really? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Alright then. See you later. Bye bye. [somber music] - [Sandra] He had a girlfriend once, and he treated her like shit. - Nice place you got here. - It's not mine, it's not mine, I just, I sold it to a big TV exec who, it's for his bimbo. Hey, what are you doing here? Alright. So I need girls. I mean, I need girls for Japan, more. - I'm going to the province next week, I'll get them. - Great. - That reminds me, after our last rendezvous. - Are you kidding me? [laughs] Fucking prostitutes. Get the fuck out of here, you little cunt! You come back and I'll fucking kill you! [suspenseful music] - [Rommy] Is Jinky asleep? - Yeah, I gave her one of my sleeping tablets. You're going to have to work, you know. I'm going to bed. - Manila was exciting. The day after I got back was Jinky's birthday. We celebrated. Che knew a place.

Rommy and I were night owls. Sandra had to find a job. [melancholy music] - Hey. - How was your night? - I had two clients. I'm just wrapping a present for him. It's his birthday. You? - It was good. I had this kinky old couple. They just wanted me to lay there naked and play with myself. I didn't have to fuck them, so.... I would've never in a million years thought that I'd be selling my body. - You're not selling your body. You're getting to where you wanna go. - And when I save up enough money, and I can get my operation, I'm done. I'm not gay, you know. Men wanna be men. I'm a woman. - You're every bit woman. - The fucked up part is that I can't even go outside my house without getting somebody's finger pointed at me. People make fun of me every single day. They treat me like I'm not even human. - But you are. You know, I've known a lot of people. Everyone used to wannna be around me. But the funny thing is you're the closest thing I've ever had to a friend. - Once you decided this is how you're gonna make your money, you can never have a proper life. - [Che] Most times it's easy to keep it impersonal. Most men are bastards. - Did you leave your phone inside? - Fuck, I did. Thanks, just a sec. - [Che] However, sooner or later, you can't keep covering up a lie. - Jinky, hi! - Hey Edward. What are you doing here? - I'm with my friends, we're gonna watch a movie, you wanna come? - I would love to, but I really can't. Maybe next time. Just grab purse, love, let's go. - I really have to go. - Cheers, mate. [solemn music] - [Che] Rommy had it the hardest. Street walkers were paid the least. Barroom girls get more money. For Rommy, Das's offer of 5,000 pesos was a fortune. When you're a prostitute, no one gives a fuck about you. Not even someone like yourselves. Who cares about us? We're nothing but a piece of meat. - What the fuck? You're a fucking dude? - Go with it, go with it. - What the fuck? You're a fucking dude? I'm sorry, sorry. So sorry, you're so beautiful, you're so beautiful, I'm sorry. - You like it rough? - Yeah. Oh shit, oh god. - You're hard, baby. Just go with it. - Oh fuck, I'm not gay. What the fuck? I'm not fucking gay. What the fuck? Fuck you! Fuck, you little fuck! I'm not gay, huh? [cries] [solemn music] - [Che] For some reason, Rommy would blame herself when she got beat up. She thought it was her fault. How fucked up is that? [screams] - I would finish roughly the same time as Jinky, so we traveled home together. Oh, hi! - Hey. - How are you? Someone left the door open. - Hello? - Who's home? No, not again. [somber music] [door closes] - Again? - Yes, again. - And who was it this time, a drunken footballer? - You're not helping, Michelle. - I keep telling her to be upfront. - Really, Michelle, really? - If she just told them she was a tranny, she'd be fine. Men don't care, anything to get their rocks off. - Can't you be any more sympathetic, Che? - I am being sympathetic. - God, you can be such a fucking bitch sometimes. - What's your problem, Jinky? Honesty is the best policy. Be honest, get the money, fuck them, and then get out. - How Che, sometimes I wonder if you're even human. - Who the fuck is? - Look, we have too few men, it's too late to do anything. Now maybe we can come up with some kind of arrangement. - We have no money. - I'm not talking about money. - I told you coming here was a waste of time. Let's go, girls. They did nothing. Who cares about a tranny prostitute? So he beat her up. He still paid. Sometimes money lasts longer than bruises. - Hey. - [Che] Still life went on. He still had my child. - How's your friend? Sorry about the other night. How's your friend? - She's quite beat up. - Yeah? Well some women like it rough, some women don't. Saw the boy the other night. - How is he? - Real fucking Picasso. - When do I get to see him? - When do I get to meet your next friend? [solemn music] - He returned another present. Can't even send him a fucking birthday present. - You know what? I know you're not as tough as you want people to think you are. - Do you know anyone who wants a fucking toy? She swore us to secrecy, she wanted to protect her little sister. I guess she got me in a moment of weakness. I told her what her sister did for money. - Jinks! Jinky, Jinky! Where have you been? - I was at the hospital, I was working. - I went to the hospital to look for a job, and for you, and you were not there. What are you doing here? Jinks, what are you doing, answer me! - It's none of your business. - What do you mean, it's none of my business? Jinks! - I'm tired, San, I need to rest. - I know what you're doing. - No you don't. - Yes I do, Che told me. Che told me you go out there and fuck everyone for money. Do you think Mom and Dad will be happy for that? - You have no idea what I'm going through. - I am your sister, so don't tell me that I don't know what you're going through. I know why you do what you do. Let me help you. - You want to help, you go home and take care of the house! - Why? So Dad can have his way with me again, and Mom does nothing? At least I got away from it. And either way, you're not saving me from anything. I'm going to stay, I'm going to help you. - No. - Jinky, I can do this, let me help you! - I'm not going to argue about this anymore! - But Jinks, I can do this, I'm grown up now, and besides, it might be fun! - Fun? You say you're all grown up and you think it might be fun? Let me tell you what fun is. Fun is when an old man reaches between your thighs and you have to pretend that you like it. It's when a foreigner kisses your breasts, and he smells like alcohol and cigarettes, and you have to make him feel good about himself. And when he's done, when he's done, you go have fun. - You talk about the sacrifices you're making, and yet not let anyone make the same mistakes. Let's do this together. Let's pay the debt and let's both get out. [somber music] If only I knew I was getting into. - [Fat Man] Off. - I thought you moved out. - Yes, I did. Edward, I'm really sorry that you had to see that. I'm sorry, but sometimes we have to do things we don't want to do. You have no idea why I do what I do. Don't you dare pass judgment on me. - [Sandra] And then I started work with Jinky. - The money's okay, and we get our own lockers, which a lot of places don't provide. - Jinks. Don't worry, okay? I'm happy to do this. She gave me the rules. Rule number one. - No matter how old, fat, disgusting, or kinky they are, be nice. - Rule number two. - Never ask if they are married or have kids. Rule number three, never give them your real name or where you live. Rule number four, trust your instincts. If something does not feel right, then something is definitely wrong. Rule number five, always collect your money first. Rule number six, always carry pepper spray. Rule number seven, always, always make them wear a condom. And rule number eight, appear confident. If not, you fake it. Are you listening to me? - Yes, I am. - Good. Remember, what we do is a lot more than physical sex and appearances. You always make them feel good about themself. And the most important thing is the first greeting, the initial hello. You get that right, he's yours forever. ♪ Can't you go without me ♪ Without, you doubt me, oh [energetic club music] ♪ Why you gotta shout at me ♪ 'Cause I'm all about me, oh ♪ Why you all up on me ♪ Can I get on the phone ♪ And you're always right behind me ♪ ♪ Whenever I'm not at home ♪ I need space, get away off my case ♪ ♪ Let me get a day out my face ♪ Gotta get my head right, I need time ♪ ♪ Got a lot of shit on my mind ♪ Can't even pick up the signs ♪ 'Cause I don't wanna fight ♪ Can't you go without me ♪ Without, you doubt me, oh ♪ I need it, I want it, I need space ♪ ♪ Why you gotta shout at me ♪ 'Cause I'm all about me, oh ♪ Bring it back, come on ♪ Can't you go without me ♪ Without, you doubt me, oh ♪ I mean it, you best get out my face ♪ ♪ Why you gotta shout at me ♪ 'Cause I'm all about me, oh ♪ We need space ♪ It would really mean a lot to me ♪ ♪ If you could just let me be ♪ Give me space ♪ I didn't mean to hurt you when I say ♪ ♪ Can you get away from me ♪ Give me space ♪ Need a little time, we could rewind ♪ [heart beats loudly] ♪ Why you gotta shout at me ♪ 'Cause I'm all about me, oh - I'm so sorry.

[speaks foreign language] And this is our movie, and we are the actors. But just like Maria Garcia, we're professionals. - Yeah. But Jinks, do you ever stop feeling so disgusting? - Never. [sniffs] [somber music] - [Che] Life goes on. You get the clients, you make them feel good. We all had our regulars. The socially inept, the cocky get-me-off, the I-don't-give-a-fuck-about-you, and the lonely, who just needs a friend. [horn honks] - Fuck you. - Again, everyone has a price. - What the fuck are you doing? How does that feel, huh? Are we good, huh? Where's your manager? Where the fuck is your manager? - [Paparazzi] Maria! - Hi, guys! It's been great, I've been blessed with such an amazing cast and crew, so I hope you guys can support it as well. Everything's been amazing with your support, so thank you, thank you so much, you guys, I love you guys! - [Fan] Maria, may I have your autograph? - [Maria] Yeah, sure, sure! - [Das] Hey. - Get away from me. - Hey. - Get away from me. - [Das] Nice to see you. - Leave me the fuck alone, get out of here. - [Das] 25. 25.

Rommy, get the fuck in the car. - [Che] Don't care what anyone says, money beats fear any day. I had to go. Have you ever had a friend, a true friend? [screams and cries] I hit him. I hit him hard. Anyway, we didn't care about him, Rommy was in trouble. - Hi, it's me. I need a favor. [somber music] He'll be here. - This is a third year student doctor, he will take care of her. I've arranged a small room at the back of the dentist. She's under the name of Peace Poi. - Thank you so much for doing this. I know you could lose your job. - No. - It's okay. - Do you want some coffee? - No, thank you. What an asshole. - I think I killed him. - [Officer] Metro Police. [sighs] - I hope she'll be okay soon. - I met Maria Garcia. - What is she like? - She's nice. - I knew it. - Let's get some breakfast. [siren blares] - The moment I saw the police car, I knew I was in trouble. I don't think I can make breakfast. - Looks like it's you and me, San. - I'm sorry. I can't live like this anymore. I'm going home. I always thought you were the weaker one. - I'll get some water. Don't worry, I'm coming back. - We left her that night, thinking that we could just all go home. [melancholy music] She died a few days later. - Well look who the cat dragged in. Oh I bet I know, I'll guess. Probably the whore house. Half-price blowjobs on the house! Half-price blowjobs on the house! [laughs] - I was at the hospital. Rommy. - Oh, the tranny? I had a crack at that once, overrated. Yeah, like I said, overrated. Hey. Wanna have some fun with me, hm? Where the fuck do you think you're going, huh? - I'm going to the police station to see Che. - Oh, the TV host. Oh, she's a great fuck. Hey, you know who else is a great fuck, too? Your little sister. - I fucking hate you. - Oh, everyone does. You know what the great thing about hate is? It's just one step away from love. - Who could ever love you? [yelps] - What do you fucking mean, who could ever love me? You're just a little cunt from the province! Oh, hey, you want me to shoot her, Daddy? I'll shoot her. Will it make you love me more, huh? We could all love each other together, huh? - I want out anyway! - Oh, do it, do it, yeah, just do it. You want out, everybody wants something. Everybody wants something, I wanted a fucking beautiful life and a father who'd put his arms around me. But you know what, I didn't get that. None of us got what we wanted, it's fucking over. Oh, but that would be just too easy. You know what? I'm gonna let you live for the next couple of years, until I say, until your body rots from all the STDs that you fucking get. And then, you know what? I'm gonna get a crack at your little sister. I'm gonna touch her, I'm gonna use her, and watch her body rot as well. Go ahead. It's easier than you think. [gun fires] [uplifting guitar music] - We are all whores. To take the money or not, to go this way or not, is who we are. Fuck, sometimes we cross that line, we don't even know it. - I haven't seen Jinky since that night she left, and walk off to see Che. A friend of mine said she saw her working on the streets. At least, she thought it was her. I hope she's alive. A few months ago, I received money from no sender, no details, no anything, no address, to help pay off the farm. And it's been going on for quite a few months. So that's my story. I miss my sister.
