What do you think? Well...I think you'd work And then, you'd probably bitch about it everyday And if your husband told you to quit working, you'd bitch about that too You are right on Perhaps you should become a fortune teller Are we feeling comfortable now? I don't know...whatever... This is good I like this Honey!

I think I need to go I don't know what I'll do if I stay That's it for today Nan... keep your door locked I might just burst in later - Good bye - See you Can't go like this I just can't I can't go like this Maybe this is too fast This is way too fast I should stop I need to be rational Is this a dream? That's because you haven't been getting any lately Just like people need to eat to live sex is the same You need to have it every now and then to stay healthy You really need to work on that Is this because I'm near my period, you think? Sleep with him! Are you crazy? I don't even know how this is gonna go That's why you need to sleep with him You need to check things out before you become too attached In any case, if your body wants it, you need to have it Fucking sexaphoic Your order's ready Caribbean salad and fajita steak nachos Old timer's ready If you need ketchup, it's over here Do you need anything else?

Couldn't you just play along? You should've told me You can't tell? Do I have to tell you everything? Forget it! What's with you? You've been making me feel uncomfortable Uncomfortable? How can you sing if you feel uncomfortable? Sorry for singing...Jesus Maybe I should of cried Why are you being sarcastic? When was I being sarcastic? Nan! Tell me what happened Couldn't you just do that? Just talk about things with me? What am I? Your chauffeur? I never asked you for a ride You liked it! You'd get mad if I didn't pick you up Whatever...you and your piece of shit car I... Met him today He's getting married I was doing so well... He said she's really nice And he said he's sorry You... tried hard to love him... and you tried hard to forget him That's all that matters Did I wake you? Want some coffee? Sure This is good Close your eyes Come on All set It's been a while since I've been carrying it around I know that this maybe a little awkward But let me get this over with Will you marry me? There are only two things to ask yourself at our age Will he make a lot of money? Or will he fulfill my desires every night? You know... I want to marry someone that is madly in love with me You like him, don't you? Yeah I like him but I'm not sure if it's love Let's drop everything and just get married Marriage? Hey! That's the only way we'll make big money at this age Only then, our parents will let loose some funds And we can start up a company with that money That's fraud How's that fraud? I'll stay married and just use the money for business What if your husband doesn't let you? That's his loss If he doesn't want in, that's his problem If not, forget it - Then marry Joon! - Hey! If not, forget it Stop making jokes like that Do you even know how he's doing? What? You mean, with Ji-hae? She's quitting her job She just needs to fix the wedding date That's impressive I'm impressed by Joon and his idiotic nature Sometimes I feel like he's mentally challenged I mean why would you waste time on something like that? They say love lasts That's why he's an idiot I had one already They say eating lasts Really! You happy? Man...I'm sweating Of course I'm happy Let me ask you the question again Would you quit if I gave you ten grand each month? What if I quit? You can study I know you still want to work in the fashion industry Why don't you get into it aggressively You know in studying Study? To be frank... I think I'll get relocated to New York That's why I rushed our marriage Now you can study... of course without the ten grand I promised What is there to think? Isn't that what you wanted all along? You're right Fix him some breakfast each morning get jiggy at night and he'll pay for your tuition, living expenses... you just hit the jackpot You're right You meet a man and problems solved God, how unfair Stop it I'm not even sure... it just doesn't feel right Whatever...that's your luck What ever happened to the blind date?

They said I might not be able to have a baby ever again You poor thing... I just can't believe this I can't believe it! Did you have to do it after having heard that? You should've just had the baby Don't worry You'll have a baby again You're right What? I knew you would react like that so I didn't get it Hey, get up! Get up! Where are we going? To the hospital You think this is funny? Oh...my belly... What? What? Watch your mouth! The baby's listening What are you kidding me? The baby's so sensitive that once the camera was put on, it raised his hand like this Hi! Where? Oh my... Isn't it adorable? Let's go! What if I want it? Then stop Joon You have the right to do that and marry him What if I don't want to get married? Why? Then why would you want the baby? - Because it's mine - What? It's my baby So are you sacrificing for Joon? The baby's listening Okay, okay Ok? Listen you don't have anything got that? If you have the baby you won't get a job nobody will date you nor marry you Are you okay with that? Why do you have to be so pessimistic? Why can't I date people when I'm this sexy? Plus, I'm going to make a lot of money and live happily ever after Christ You might lose your father, mother and Joon all together Are you sure you can handle that? I got you, don't? What is it? Jesus... Didn't tell you not to drink that much? You're fucking up your stomach - Are you okay? - I'm okay You sure? Yeah, get out! I'm going to pee Oh...okay Hey, Dong-mi why don't you come with me? We can share offices and work together - Joon! - Yeah? Worry about yourself - Think about it - If Dong-mi leaves, Seoul will cry Just get me a boyfriend before you leave Fool! Is that so hard? You inconsiderate asshole... - Here! - What? I think you forgot, but I'm a man too, you know I'll let you borrow me one last time Okay How's that? Hug me harder Like this? Harder Harder? This is pathetic Dong-mi finally started her business through her fan club Those people would die for her if they had to Or that's what she says at least Who is it? Is it you? Is it you? Can't be all of you... Are you still going to have the baby? What if your baby asks who the father is later? My baby will only thank me for bringing it into this world Okay it's your choice Just do it I'll be the father, and you can be the mother I'll go out and make money to buy milk If someone gives you shit I'll handle it Nan... And if anyone looks down on you for being a single mom I'll beat the crap out of them So don't worry, okay? Got that, LEE Dong-mi? Whatever You should've said something already Who washes their face in the kitchen? I felt bad, that's why Don't feel sorry Soo-heon Sorry I thought I had talent in fashion But I think it was all fruitless Trying so hard to reach for the stars But when I started to work here One day, I just felt like maybe this is it I'm not exactly sure if I have talent in this but I want to try I want to see the end of it I need to figure out what I'm made of That's the first step I need to take, right? So... That's why I can't get married For a while Is anything else broken? Tell me now I don't want you washing your face in the toilet Don't worry!

Couldn't you get something blue? How about this? Sorry I'm going to breast feed Are you stupid? You can't breast feed the whole time Besides you can use this for water Oh yeah... why didn't I think of that? Babies drink water, right?
