Anything at all out of the ord-- - She isn't a tenant, I can tell you that. - People were coming out all the time, to see. - Did you see anyone who wasn't a tenant? - Ask Frank, maybe he can help you. - But I'm asking you. - I'm telling you I don't know. - Come on. - Is there a garage around here, somewhere? - Yeah. - Okay, where is it? - Round the corner. - [Henderson] Well, let's go. - Need a key. - You got a key? - Yeah. - Wonderful.

(sliding door creaking) There a service entrance to this place? - [Superintendent] I don't know. - Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. You don't know anything. I found a light! - Good thinking, great future ahead of you, boy! - [Paquette] Thank you. (siren wailing) (car horn honking) Nothing, I mean nothing. - [Jim] Yeah, but I mean, look what she was wearing, I mean, somebody must've let her in and come up with her. Whoever had, they took everything with him. - I think I got it. - What? - [Paquette] Big executive comes in from out of town, hot for some hooker action. She comes up here-- - He whips it out, she takes one look. (whistling) (panting) - [Man] It's never been like this with anybody else. (panting) You think I'm lying, but that's the truth. - [Woman] I'm glad. I want you to feel good. - Where are you going? - Oh, I've got to go home. I'm tired and worn out, you know? - But I, I thought it was going to be all night. - Oh, no. That's something you have to book well in advance. - [Man] So, that's it then? - Are you kidding? - But I don't get a chance to be with someone like you every day. - Well then. You be sure to call me next time you're in town. - I just hate to see you go. - You're too much of a man for me. I've got to go home and rest up. (man crying) Oh, I know. You really are something. Are you this virile all the time? - [Man] Only with you. - Well then. Please be sure and call me next time. (Muzak-like jazz music) - Okay, what's happened? - At Cote St. Catherine there's a 20-story apartment house. She went off the top of it. - [Girl In Distance] Oh, God! - What's that? - [Woman In Robe] A girl that stays with me. Go back to bed, Nora. - [Henderson] No no no, I want her, a witness. (Henderson knocking on door) All right, honey, come on out of there. Come on. (girl weeping) That's it. You heard what my partner just said, huh? - [Nora] Elizabeth. - Elizabeth what? - Elizabeth Lucy. - Is that her real name? - [Woman In Robe] I doubt it. - [Nora] Jesus. (weeping) - [Henderson] So that's Elizabeth, huh? - That's her. - Okay. She lives here, uh? - [Woman In Robe] Some of the time. - [Henderson] Some of the time? How 'bout the rest of the time? - I don't know. - You don't know. Was she here last night? - [Woman In Robe] For a while. Then she went out, that's all I know. - [Paquette] Where'd she go to? - I'm not-- - You're her madame? She gets her tricks through you, now where'd she go? - I don't know what you're talking about. Elizabeth and Nora are entertainers. I'm their manager. - Bullshit. - [Woman In Robe] Stop crying, Nora. (Nora weeping) - [Henderson] Well what was she wearing? (speaking foreign language) - [Nora] Nora Tremblay. (mumbles) - What color? - Black, I think. - [Henderson] Handbag? - [Woman In Robe] Yes. - [Henderson] And you don't have any regular customers around that area, Cote St. Catherine and Nelson? - I wouldn't know about that. - [Paquette] Goddammit, Jim, let me talk to her. - Take it easy. - [Paquette] I don't like her attitude. - Okay, I'd like to see Elizabeth's room, please. Nora? Come on. You show it to me, huh? - Uh uh, you stay here, we'll have a little talk. Look, whore, let's get something straight right now. I was on the Morality squad for three years and I liked putting white asses like you in jail. I still like it, so don't get me any more pissed off at you than I am right now, you understand me? - I understand you, all right. But I can't tell you what I don't know. She worked for me some of the time, the rest of the time was her own. Find somebody else and ask them. - I'll tell you this, if I don't hear what I wanna hear from you, I'm gonna bust you just as heavy as I can. - You can't do shit to me. - Was she on smack? - Yeah. - [Jim] You recognize that guy? - No. - [Jim] Him? Go and sit there, please. She have any boyfriends, now? - [Nora] She's dead. - No, not now, I mean before, recently. - No, no steady boyfriend. - [Jim] You sure? If you could find some letter or something personal.. She went a long way down. - There was that girl, Sandra. - Sandra, who's she? - She used to be here. It was Elizabeth who liked her. - Yeah? Where's she now? - (weeping) She just disappeared about a week ago. Nobody knows where she went. (weeping) Meg was really mad as hell. You know, she let her stay here, and brokered her into the business and all. - Oh, yeah, I can imagine. Oh, boy, I guess she's pretty tough, eh, Meg? - [Nora] She's not so bad. - She and Elizabeth, they got along together? - [Nora] She was Meg's favorite. Meg really liked her. - [Jim] Hmm. - [Nora] I did, too. - She was a Catholic, wasn't she? Oh, it's okay, it's okay, I'm Catholic. Well, technically, anyway. Not a very good one. - Me too. - She was wearing a crucifix, you know? - Elizabeth? I never saw her wear one. - [Jim] What about this? - She had a couple of rings. That's all I ever saw her wear. - [Jim] But she was a Catholic? - [Nora] Technical, like you and me. - All right. You think she'd kill herself? - I don't think she would, but-- - Look, she was on drugs. If she didn't kill herself, someone pushed her off that balcony, someone killed her. You know who that might be? (Nora weeping) - He took my phone book. - I'll tell you what I'm gonna do with it, Meg. I'm gonna run down every last john in here and blow your whistle once and for all. - [Meg] Look, you know he doesn't have any right to do that. - Well, you shouldn't've got him mad at you, Mrs. Lattimer. - I've got a lawyer. - I'll bet. - Okay, okay, get dressed. - Where're we going? - Just get your clothes on. - [Meg] You don't have any reason. - Maybe my partner will think of something on the way downtown. - [Paquette] Come on, move along. (classical music) (priest officiating in foreign language) - Amen. (speaking foreign language) - [Nun] Amen. (speaking foreign language) - Amen. (speaking foreign language) - Amen. (speaking foreign language) (whispering) - Elizabeth, what are you doing here? - Won't you let me see Sandra for a few minutes? - It's not a good idea, it's too soon. - Just a few minutes. - [Woman In Pink] Elizabeth. - [Elizabeth] Oh, darling, how are you? - Sandra, you can take Elizabeth to your room if you want, but just for a few minutes. And come and see me before you go, I'll be in my office. - [Elizabeth] All right. I'm really glad to see you. - Me too. Well, this is it. They're all driving me crazy. - Who's driving you crazy? - The sisters! There's always one of them around. Even when I go to the john. - [Elizabeth] It can't be that bad. - Oh no? Good morning, Sister Therese. - Good morning, Sandra. - [Elizabeth] Well, I guess they have to do that, honey. - Why? They're afraid I'm shooting up? I'm off, I'm off, for two days. Why can't they trust me? - Darling, you were doing 10 grams a day. You were all out of control. You would have died. - What about you? You're still shooting, aren't you? - That's a whole different thing, I mean, I'm not doing half of what you were. And if I were, I'd be here. - Elizabeth, you are still shooting, aren't you? Why can't I just cut down to your dose? - Because it doesn't work that way. Where's that wrap, it's so cold. - [Sandra] What's happening, Elizabeth? You need some junk? (slap resounding) (Sandra wailing) You wouldn't stand it here for a day, Elizabeth! You'd freak right out. - [Elizabeth] I guess I, I would. Yes. Yes, I would. (sobbing) Sandra, I'm so proud of you. - [Sandra] Proud of me, everybody's so fuckin' proud of me, why? - (sobbing) Because you're alive. Because you're healthy. Because yeah, getting back. - [Sandra] To what? - Back, to getting back to, to... Normal. - I don't even know what that means. - Sandra, please try. - I wanna go back! - Please try for me. - [Sandra] Junk, I need it, right now! (wailing) (dramatic music) (Sandra screaming) (Elizabeth muttering) - [Meg] What's going on? - [Man] I don't know if you guys noticed, but she's got needle marks on her. - [Jim] Yeah? You must've looked her over real good. - [Man] Well, listen, my wife don't look half as good, and she ain't even dead yet. - [Paquette] Well? - Well, what? That's Elizabeth. - Okay, let's go. (footsteps echoing) No no, you stay. (water dripping) - Is there anything else you want to tell me? Okay, she can go. - I thought you were going to book me. - Maybe next time. (metal clanging) (dramatic music) - Good morning, Mistress. - Good morning, Mr. Worther. - You look tired. - I am tired. - You have a long drive? Would you like to come have a drink with me before you go upstairs? - No, thanks. I'll just-- - What difference does it make to you? I can treat you right. Anyway, a guy in my position can make things tough for you, you know. - Let's just say you're a little drunk. At 8:30 on a Saturday morning. And leave it at that. Excuse me. - [Meg] It's almost nine o'clock. - [Elizabeth] I fell asleep. - [Meg] I don't pay you to sleep. - This one did. - [Meg] And up til now? - I drove around for a while, I, I wanted to get some air. - [Meg] You must have gotten a hell of a lot at nine o'clock. - Well, I needed a lot, Meg. - Listen, I always want you to come straight back. It's smarter. A guy loses his wallet, and yells "Cop." I don't want you wandering around where they can pick you up. - All right, Meg, I'm sorry. - [Meg] I'm saying it for your own good. - Look I, I'm tired, and I'm a little strung out. - [Meg] Yeah, you're late for that, too. - [Elizabeth] No, I'll just fix up and go to sleep. - [Meg] Not here. Go to the other apartment. - Why? - [Meg] Just do what I tell you. - [Elizabeth] I really need to. - [Meg] Take it with you and do it over at your place. - Uh, why do I have to leave? - Because you messed up my schedule by being so late. I have somebody coming over and I don't want you around. - I'll be in my room. - I don't want to argue with you. - All right. I'll just get my stuff. - [Meg] Go get it. (telephone ringing) Hello. Another few minutes. No. So. Maybe. (receiver clicking) - Who was that, Meg? - Hurry up and get out. - You didn't answer the question. (ominous music) When do you want me back? - I'll call you. - All right. Bye! (suspenseful music) (clock chiming) (Jim sighing) - I thought you were tired. - [Jim] Damn right I'm tired. - Come back to bed. - [Jim] I'm not that tired. - Come back to bed anyway. - No, I got uh, something on my mind. Mm. (sighing) A lot of things I have to do. Where the bloody hell are my shoes? - Why today? - [Jim] Why not? - It's Sunday, for God's sake. - [Jim] So? - [Jane] So when am I gonna see you? All of you? - Well. Well. (sighing) Come on, look, I'm just going away for a couple of hours, huh? Hmm? Then I'll come back after. Okay? - I don't know. I'm going out tonight. - Oh? You uh, you want me to come back, or uh, or not? - [Jane] I said I'm going out tonight. - Well, uh, good, I'll see you later. - I don't like playing second fiddle to some hooker!

You remind me of my father. - [Jimmy] Well that's a compliment, isn't it? - Oh, God, I feel like hell. - [Jimmy] You're very hostile. - I just don't like to be nagged, that's all.

A Mr. Lefram is coming over to see you. - Over here? - Yeah. Stay home, he'll be there. - [Elizabeth] Wait a minute. Why did you give him this address? - [Meg] I just told you, baby, they're special people. Very important. Lots of bread. - I don't care, I don't want anybody to know about this place, Meg. - [Meg] Now listen to me. There's a lot of money in this. For both of us. These people are very, very heavy. They're interested in you. You should be flattered. - I'm not flattered! - [Meg] I want you to do this for me, baby.

Lefram, Lefram, so far, name, Herbert Lefram, alias Sandor Banzini, 29 years old, muscle-bound, did three years at Kingston for pushing dope-- - Okay, he's been all over the place. - Disappeared for two years, con artist-- - Okay, get his pictures out. (banging) - Meg! Meg? - [Meg] Well? Did you see him? - [Elizabeth] No, I didn't see him, I went out and he followed me. What's going on, Meg? - I told you to stay home. - You don't tell me anything. Not you or anyone else. - [Man] You're a hard girl to get a hold of. - This is your special customer. - [Man] The man I work for would like to meet you. - [Elizabeth] Not interested. - That's too bad. Everything's been arranged. - Not so far as I'm concerned. - Okay, let me talk to her. Now look. I never crossed you, and I've always treated you like royalty. I'm asking you simply to trust me. And not to ask so many questions. - Not to ask so many questions? - Okay, listen. It was supposed to be Sandra, it was all set. Then she disappeared. - So? - Would I let anything bad happen to that little girl? - [Elizabeth] I don't know, Meg. - Sandra and you were very close. Do you know where she is? - No. - Okay. You're asking me to believe you and I'm asking you to believe me. Will you? - All right. But I don't guarantee anything. You and I had an agreement about my apartment, yes? Now all bets are off. - Let's go. - Let's go. (speaking foreign language) - It's a pyx. - A pyx? What the hell's a pyx? (speaking foreign language) - Yeah, my grandmother nearly died four times, and each time, the priest brought the host in the (speaking foreign language), in a pyx. - This is a pyx? - Yeah. (speaking foreign language) - If you don't, I can make a hell of a lot of trouble for you and everybody else, you understand? (speaking foreign language) (suspenseful music) (classical music) - Sit down. (classical music) - You are Elizabeth. - Yeah. Who are you? - My name is Keerson. How do you do? (classical music) Why don't you sit here? (classical music) Would you like some refreshments, a glass of wine, anything? Well. Let's have a little talk then. - All right, there are a few things I'd like to say. First of all I don't like being investigated. Secondly I don't like being followed. - He was just carrying out my instructions. - [Elizabeth] Why? - Because I'm interested in you. And it's only natural to want to know a bit about people one is going to be involved with, don't you think? (classical music) Take your clothes off, please. - I don't do this for nothing. - We all have to pay for the important moments in life, Elizabeth. (classical music) - Well? What do you want me to do? - Tell me about yourself. - Like what? - [Keerson] Where were you born? (classical music) - Bedford, 40 miles south of Montreal. - [Keerson] And you grew up there? - Yes. - What about your parents? - Uh, look. Why do we have to talk about these things? - [Keerson] I want to know all about you. - But why? - It's part of what I'm paid for. - My mother died when I was three. I was brought up by my father and a housekeeper. Mostly by a housekeeper. - Where did you go to school? - There's a convent near Bedford. My father sent me there. - So your upbringing was quite religious, then? Do you believe in God? - I wouldn't say I was a practicing Catholic, if that's what you mean. (classical music) Yes, I believe in God. - You may put your clothes on now. Mr. Lefram will take you home. We will call you very soon. (classical music) - [Jim] Santo? - [Paquette] That's Elizabeth's father. He's an ex-army airman. That's his house in Bedford. Still lives there, that's where Elizabeth grew up. Definitely from him. As far as he's concerned, she died seven years ago. That's her first boyfriend, came from a good family. Had a good future. Became a dope addict and dropped out. - [Jim] Is there more? - [Cop] I just had some mug shots from Lefram run off. Every radio car should have them within an hour. - We're trying to break the code in Lattimer's phone book. That number the super was calling turns out to be a goddamn phone booth at St. Mark and Sherbrooke. (yelling) He loves it here. (solemn choral music in foreign language) - Classy, isn't it? - You assaulted a police office with intent to kill. Are you ready to be a little helpful? Elizabeth was there last night. Meg Lattimer was there last night. Now where were you? (laughing) Lattimer was found this morning with her throat slit, along with another one of her girls. Maybe you're next, so wise up! Come on, we know everything. The name of the company that owns that penthouse is called Bose Incorporated, the friend's name is Keerson, and Lefram works for him. Now you were with Keerson last night, weren't you? You were with Keerson last night! (superintendent groaning) Where's Keerson now? (yelling) We're onto you! Where's Keerson? - Hey. Ever notice that before? Ever see it upside down? Hmm? (solemn choral music in foreign language) What about this? (pyx hinge clicking) (shouting in foreign language) You ready to talk now, hmm? (slap resounding) (superintendent groaning) - Wait, Henderson. (speaking foreign language) Uh huh. Oh, you've got it, huh. Okay. Keep them there, I'm ready, how many? (church bell tolling) (tires squealing) - [Elizabeth] Dr. Hildebrand, I'm glad I got you. Nothing, I'm all right, look. I'm going to Spain tonight. There are some things I want to get to you. Um, an insurance policy and some money. I want you to hold onto them for me. Sandra. Well, I just, I want you to hold onto them, that's all. I can't explain it, it's nothing, it's just a feeling I have. All right, now. I can't get out to meet you, is there anybody who could meet me? No, not here. Please, don't ask me any questions, Dr. Hildebrand. Just help me. All right. All right. Can you call him right away? I'll be there within a half hour. Thank you. (footsteps echoing) Didi, Didi! (speaking foreign language) I have to go someplace. Merci! ♫ I'm lying in my bed ♫ I sought him whom my soul loveth ♫ I sought him but I found him not ♫ I rise now ♫ And go about the city in the streets ♫ And in the broad ways ♫ I will seek him ♫ Whom my soul loveth ♫ I sought him ♫ But I found him not (acoustic guitar music) ♫ The watchmen that go about the city ♫ Found me ♫ To whom I said ♫ Saw you him ♫ Whom my soul loveth ♫ I sought him ♫ But I found him not - [Elizabeth] Dr. Hildebrand sent me to see you. - [Priest] Yes! You're Elizabeth. - [Elizabeth] I want you to take this, and give it to her. - [Priest] Give it to me when you leave here. - [Elizabeth] I'm being watched. I'll leave it here. You take it, when I leave. - [Priest] Why don't you talk to me, as long as you're here? Sister said you might need to. - [Elizabeth] I don't have anything to say. - [Priest] How long is it since you have made a confession? - I don't want to confess, Father. I just want-- - I didn't ask you to. But tell me, how long has it been? - A long time. I'm going now. Thank you, Father. (tires squealing) (car door slamming) - I'm taking you back to your place, to rest up for tonight. Now, you care for Sandra and Jimmy, right? I suggest you be at Lattimer's at ten o'clock tonight. Stop makin' me work so hard. (lively jazz music) (bar patrons chatting) - [Jimmy] I'm sorry, I suppose that's not a normal reaction. - [Jim] Well I've been a cop 23 years, I don't know what that means. - You see I loved her very much. - Yeah. - I'm a homosexual. I never really had any sort of a friendship with a woman in my life. We met almost a year ago. Things were pretty bad for me. I'd already had one breakdown. I was on my way to another. This guy I was with, I was very involved with him but he wasn't a very nice person. One night, we were in a restaurant. It was worse than usual. Anyway, I finally ran out into the parking lot. I was sitting there on the ground between two cars. I suppose I was gonna kill myself. I looked up. And she was there. She'd seen the whole thing. And she came out. She talked to me. She understood what was happening to me, I didn't have to tell her anything. She just understood it all. She took me back to her apartment. She made coffee and we talked. I just stayed there. I knew there was something too going on yesterday but she wouldn't tell me about it. - Something terrible, what was that? - [Jimmy] She couldn't talk about it, except-- - Except what? - [Jimmy] Very rich, very important, with a big ship, the Mount Royal. - [Jim] What was his name, did she tell you? - [Jimmy] Peersaw, or Pearson, something like that. - Keerson? - Yeah, Keerson, that was it. Really didn't seem surprised. Annoyed, maybe. It was like she knew they were watching her. - [Jim] Who was watching her, Keerson? - [Jimmy] I don't know. - Well, could you identify the guy that was following her? - Yeah, I think I could-- (gunshots booming) (thudding) (lively folk music) - What time is it? - [Jimmy] 20 after nine. Why? The rich guy. - I told you, I have to go to Meg's. - [Jimmy] Right now? - I'd better. - At least finish your coffee. - It's all right, you stay and finish your eclair. (speaking foreign language) if you don't eat it. - You can have the car. - [Jimmy] Let me drive you there. - I'd rather walk, honestly. - If I drive, you'd have time to stay. Finish that coffee. - Jimmy. Let me go. You stay. I'll see you later, back at the apartment. - All right. When will you be back? - I don't know. Late. - [Man] Au revoir, Mademoiselle Elizabeth. (lively folk music) - I fixed up an hour ago, but I, I didn't get straight. - [Meg] I told you not to do that tonight. - I'm going to get through this any way I can. In fact, I was thinking of asking you if I could have another. - Doesn't want you to. I'll make you a drink instead. - You know I don't drink. - [Meg] A soft drink. - [Elizabeth] When do the festivities commence? - [Meg] They'll call us. - Where do the festivities commence? - You ask too many questions. (liquid sloshing) (beeping) (crashing) (siren wailing) - [Paquette On Tape] Henderson, call local five four, have found Lefram. (siren wailing) (rotary phone dial whirring) (telephone ringing) - Hello? All right. - Now? - Finally broke the code in Meg's book and staked out Lefram. He's already wounded Santo and Climent. They found him at the docks on a large freighter that Keerson owns. (gunshots booming) (bullets whizzing) (gunshots booming) - Who's up there, Lefram? - [Cop In Front] Lefram on the boat. - [Cop In Back] He's alone on the boat, and he's crazy. (bullets whizzing) (gunshots booming) (siren wailing) - He's got one of our men as hostage. (gunshots booming) - Yeah. (gunshots booming) - Lefram! You might as well give up, you're gonna bleed to death anyway. (footsteps echoing) - [Lefram] You don't want this son of a bitch's head shot off, you get a doctor up here, right now. - Right, you'll get your doctor. Now put him down. You'll get your doctor. (solemn choral music) - I don't feel very well. - Come on, I'll bring you somewhere where you can lie down. (mumbles) (solemn choral music) - Meg, what's wrong with me? I feel so weird. - [Meg] You're gonna be fine, that's all. (laughing) (solemn choral music) - This isn't right. This is all different. - Come on, come on. (solemn choral music) I gave you a little something. - [Elizabeth] What? - Just, you know, to help you get in the mood. - What? - [Meg] He told me to. - Who told you to? What did you give me? - [Meg] Don't worry, baby, you're going to be all right. (Elizabeth moans) (solemn choral music) - [Lefram] Take your clothes off. Put this on. - [Meg] Let her lie down for a few minutes first. (Elizabeth gasping) - [Elizabeth] What is it, Meg? It's making me so sick. - I told you. (Elizabeth laughing) Lie down in the meantime. (mumbles) (solemn choral music) (Elizabeth crying out) - Get her ready. - Get dressed with me. (solemn choral music) Feeling better? - I feel fine. - Come. Get into this. They want you to put this on. (solemn choral music) - The doctor's on his way up! Now, where's Keerson? - [Lefram] He's waiting for you! - Okay, he's here now. Careful, careful, I'm right behind you. Is everyone in position, please? - [Cop On Walkie-Talkie] Position one ready, position two ready. (footsteps echoing) - Hey. You a doctor? - Yeah. - Come on. All right. That's far enough. Put the bag down. Easy. (gunshots booming) - Take care of him, quick. (eerie choral music) - Liz, are you ready?. (eerie choral music) - You look lovely and innocent. - This is the way you want me. - Almost. Just let me add this. That's perfect. We'll go in in a moment. - What's going to happen? - You're going to become part of something powerful. You're going to help me achieve a miracle. - I don't want to go inside. - Yes. (eerie choral music) - [Officiant] Breathe it deep, Elizabeth. (Elizabeth inhaling) (eerie choral music) - Host. (mumbles) - It has been consecrated. And now we must desecrate it. (eerie choral music) (siren wailing) (door latch clicking) (creaking) (breath rattling) - [Jim] Keerson. Wake up. (slap resounding) Can you hear me? - Yes. I can hear you, Henderson. I've been expecting you. - Elizabeth Lucy. Remember her? - [Keerson] Yes. Elizabeth. - You conducted a Black Mass last night. (Keerson's breath rattling) You killed her, Keerson. Didn't you? (Keerson's breath rattling) And three others. There's a lot of people seem to die around you, Keerson. - Stop calling me that. It's not my name. It's not my name at all. - [Jim] Oh yeah? What's your name then? - You know my name. You know it, Henderson. You know it better than anyone. When your wife died in that accident, you were happy. You felt liberated. My name touched you then. You went to confession. It didn't help. You couldn't forget, you didn't want to. You, too, felt the hypocrisy of the church. Why don't you kill me? - Oh, I will. You better know it, I will. - No. No, Henderson, you can't. You keep a little corner of morality inside that stinking soul of yours, that minor delusion to convince yourself that you still know good from evil. But you don't know it, Henderson. You don't know it till you touch it. Till you open yourself up to the power. When it manifests itself, then you know. And it's there, it is, it exists, I've seen it. I've become it. (gunshots booming) (empty pistol clicking) (Keerson exhaling) - You set me free. (thudding) (pistol thudding) ♫ I was touched by you then ♫ By your pale seen eyes ♫ I was lulled by your morning face ♫ By your pale eyes ♫ When I knew you would let me in ♫ As I stood over there ♫ And you opened all my spaces ♫ Find me there ♫ Gently down to you ♫ Starting with those ♫ Gone with the morning sun
