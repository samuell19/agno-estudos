Being a minor celebrity doesn't endear you to everyone. That's what I was, the whiz kid... The super nerd. By the time I was 18, I'd appeared on 27 talk shows. I guess that made me some kind of target. But I was oblivious. I was happy. I was in love with Bombshell. Back then, she was working as a pediatric doctor, while I worked late on the technology that would change the future of the entire world forever. Change, it was my religion. It was 70 years since the atom bomb had exploded onto an unprepared world. Nothing of any significance had happened since. Nanotechnology was going to create profound change to the lives of every single human being on the planet, and I liked that. So did Donald... Although, his motivations were different than mine. He was like a pioneer medicine man forging ahead into unknown territory. And just like them, he was a charlatan. First there came fire... Then the wheel, then electricity. Each invention brought about massive technological, social, and political change. What I'm about to show you is the most revolutionary scientific invention since electricity. Using individual atoms as building blocks, we can construct basic tools and machines called nano-engines. These nano-engines are programmed to work as teams, reconstructing the atomic structure of damaged cells. Here, a nano-engine is busy reassembling a feline bone marrow cell, which is corrupted by cancer. The rogue atom in the cell is replaced, creating a rejuvenated, youthful cell, and the nano-engines move on to the next cell, and the next and the next, all day, every day, constantly reassembling the damaged cells, constantly creating new from old. Creating... Creating... Shit. Cut!I, I can't read the damn thing. Can't you make bigger letters? And I feel stupid pointing at that. There's nothing on it!Fantastic, Don. It was great. Can somebody do something about the teleprompt, please? Oh, hello. Uh, you must be the journalist from, uh... Melinda Clark. I'm freelance. I work for myself. Nice to meet you. We'll be showing this video to our human test group at the press event on Friday. This director's fantastic. He did those great spots for Vectordyne's biochip launch. Hmm. Impressive. Malcolm... Come over here. Look at this. I knew this would happen some day. The feline tests have been so successful, that we feel totally confident going ahead with the human trials. Donald, I... I need to talk to you. We've had a problem with one of the cats. Buck, I'd like you to meet Melinda. She's a journalist. Donald tells me you're the man to speak to. We're ready for you now.Excuse me. Donald, I have to speak to you.It can wait. No, it can't wait.I said later. You can tell me. That's why I'm here. To get under the skin of Nanolab Industries. Well, maybe you should talk with Adam. I'm sure he'd love to get under your skin. Quiet, please! Settle. Speed. Roll camera! Marker.MAN: Action. Welcome to Wedding-rom 3000, the online wedding dress superstore for the bride seeking a quality, preowned wedding dress. Here, you can see the Windsor dress is beautifully tailored in Brazilian silk, spun by free-range worms fed on organically grown products. Available in cerise, plum and vermilion. It originally carried the list price of over $5,500. It's now... Phone call. Home. Phone call. Hello? Hi, Bombshell. It's me. Don't Bombshell me. Who's Melinda? Huh? Has she called our house? Yeah. She called our house. Something you should tell me? No. She's just a journalist. Mmm-hmm. Just a journalist with $20,000 breast implants and a $10,000 nose job. Ah, you're the only one for me, angel. Bet you say that to all the girls. Uh... Well, only those I intend to marry. I'll be home soon, okay? Okay. Bye. Bye. Still find me sexy? Of course I still find you sexy. You're perfect. Sexy as that journalist Melinda? Hmm?Hell, yes. She's not sexy. She's, she's a journalist. She keeps calling. Maybe you should meet her. You know what? Fuck her. Don't fuck her. Fuck me. I love it when you do that. Welcome to Nanolab. Hey, here he is. The man himself. DNA corruption. Override. Oh, no. Malcolm! Malcolm, N-27 is having a seizure! DNA nuclear path. Override. Morning, Dewayne. Status red. Buck Corgan. Buck Corgan... Ah, shit. - To the quarantine lab. - Status red. Status red. Buck Corgan. Buck Corgan. To the quarantine lab. Status red. DNA corruption. Override... What's happening? I don't know. The sampler's showing 100 NR, but the DNA nucleotides are showing negative gain. What's the TN? It's 50 or 60. I can't tell. It's screaming off the scale. Let's open it up. She's dying.What? Carol, give me 50 mils of dopamine, straight. - That's too much. - It'll kill her. I know. Let's get her out of there. - Assembly error confirmed. - Suggest termination. Shut down request. N-27 corrupt. - Batch error 339... DNR rate. Zero. Rate. Zero, confirmed. N-27 manufacturer quit. Carol, would you take her downstairs to Riuki, and have him do a subatomic autopsy right away? Okay. We need to start over with the assemblers. We have to retool them from the ground up. We don't have the time or the money. What do you mean, we don't have the time? You said if we needed more time we would have more time, you promised me. Look, Malcolm, I understand, okay? No, I don't think you do understand. This sets us back two months. You have to go to bat for us. You have to get us more money, get us more time.I know. I'm going to talk to Donald. I'm gonna beg him for more time, You can't just go in there and talk to Donald. You have to tell them we can't do these tests on Friday. We need more time. We need more research. I know that, but there's a system here, okay? And you can't beat the system. You have to work it from the inside. Listen to yourself. You're sounding just like them, sounding just like Donald, just like those bean counters, those money men. This is not a university research lab. Okay? This is a business, it's an industry, and the goal here is to make a profit. And I don't like that any more than you do. Now, if that goes against your work ethic, I suggest you go back to working for the government on some tax-funded research project. And do something about your cough because this is a sterile environment. The good news is we have gap financing of $3.6 million at 3 percent above prime. So what's the bad news? The loan is guaranteed by Oromitshu Holdings, and they've got a deal breaker. Which is? We've got to stick to our launch date. Meaning? Meaning, either we go with the human trials on Friday or we die. Buck Corgan is here. Perfect. Donald, we can't proceed with the human trials. Sit down. Coffee, Buck? That cat that died, it died of a replication error. Sit down, Buck. Things have changed a little just this past hour. Basically, we're in a no-win situation with the banks. So, it all comes down to this. We will go ahead with the human trials on Friday. In the meantime, your department will do everything in your power to try to find the cause of the problem and continue working to solve it even after the trials are underway. You don't understand how serious this is, do you? Of course I understand how serious it is. Now, you asked me for more time, and I gave it to you. Now I'm telling you there is no more time. Well, I want it to go on record that I advised you against this in the strongest terms possible. We, we could all be liable for manslaughter. Your statement is noted. What next? Major accident ahead. Detour available. Accept detour. Next intersection turn right. Next intersection turn left. Next intersection turn right. Turn right. Right? Great. Excuse me. Excuse me. Jesus. Full diagnosis request approved. Well, do you want the good news or bad news? Or weird news? Good news. Whoever did this knew what they were doing... But one of your kidneys is gone. Well, what's the weird news? There's something in its place. What? Well, it seems like there's some sort of bag... Where your kidney used to be. We're gonna have to have tests tomorrow with you. No, I, I can't. I've got a major crisis on my hands. I'm three hours late already. Buck. Thanks for squeezing us in. I know you don't wanna hear this, but we have to go to the police. The police can wait. I have to go to work. There's people relying on me. I'm relying on you. I'm relying on you being healthy. I'm relying on you not dying. I'm relying on you being a good husband. I cried myself to sleep last night after spending hours on the phone with the police department, wondering if you'd been killed. And now you're telling me, you don't have time to make a report. Is there something I should know? I just don't think they'll... No. No, there's nothing you should know. Well, maybe there's other cases. There's molecular tracking, DNA splicing. They can help. I'm sorry, but the department cannot be of any help at this time. The ultrasound scan doesn't provide enough evidence for a conviction. I suggest you come back when you have more evidence and save your credit hours. If you want me to proceed with this... You want more evidence than this? But your Calcop account stands at... 35 credit hours. I think you'd find that the credit would expire before we'd have time to build a strong case. What about a weak case? What about dusting the car for fingerprints? DNA testing? Fiber analysis? We only send forensics out for homicides and rapes. Officer, he was kidnapped. He was operated on. Doesn't that matter? Don't you care? Yes, it does matter, yes, I do care, which is why I'm advising you to come back when you have more evidence. You're one of the world's leading atomic and nanomechanical design engineers. Only a handful of people in the world even understand what it is you do. You live in a world of biological possibilities only previously explored by God. What sort of design philosophy, what kind of safeguard do you build in to protect a nano-engine host from malfunctioning? It's interesting. The idea of nano-engines being some lethal ent-- Lethal entity is, is, is-- Is really-- Liable to go out of control-- Something inherited from science fiction. Every job is divided into individual tasks-- Tasks-- And then we program one nano-engine for each task. No nano-engine is capable of creating anything by itself-- By itself. Isn't it true that a reassembling problem recently caused the death of one of the laboratory animals? Yes, that is correct. So, would you say your theory of nano-engines working as a team is a failure? Failure. Uh... No. No. No, no, no. I wouldn't say that at all. I would say-- I would-- We, we need more time. We need more time. But with human trials set to begin on Friday, couldn't you run into the risk of the same problem with a human subject? Yes. Thank you, Malcolm. You see that?Mmm-hmm. It's unusual. It's as if the object has anchored itself in place. These growths could be just benign connective tissue. It could be that it's operable. I'll have him take a scan right away. Call me when you have, and if the prognosis is positive, we'll proceed with exploratory on Thursday. Thank you, Doctor. Phone call. Nanolab. Buck. Phone call. Phone call. Hi. You've reached Buck Corgan. I've stepped away from my desk right now. I'm probably constructing something very microscopic. Leave me a message, and I will get back to you... Bye. Hey, it's me. I know you're busy-- Pick up. Hi. How're you feeling? Ah, pressured. Look, um, can you meet me for a late lunch? I showed the scan to Dr. Braunmann, and he has a few comments. Can't you just tell me? Honey, I need to show you in person. Please? I can't. The Soy Palace in 20 minutes. Ah, for you, anything. Really-- Jesus. - Vid e-mail... - Vid e-mail... Save it. Can't save streaming video. Play back. Did you enjoy your trip to the hospital? To the cops? You're involved in a very unique test of character and you're scoring low. So... I removed your left kidney and replaced it with a synthetic gel-sac containing nitric acid. In three days, the sac will dissolve, flooding your kidneys and your surrounding organs. It's gonna hurt. If you want to avoid this, go to the revolving restaurant at LAX. At precisely 3:00 p.m. Sit at table 23. Taped underneath the table is a box. Deliver the box to the address on it at 4:00 p.m. If you don't... Indigestion? Look, I don't have time to talk to you right now. So, I hear one of the cats died. That's not public knowledge. Okay. Then... Off the record... What killed it? The profit motive. Uh-huh. Better hurry. Time's running out. Hi. How many in your party? It's just me. Oh. Um... Table 15, okay? Actually, I'd prefer table 23. Oh... Oh, a window seat. Okay. Follow me. Actually, could I just have the table that I asked for? Oh, um... Well, this is a revolving restaurant. Every table gets the same view. It's... Revolving. I met my wife sitting at table 23. Oh, okay. Well, um, it'll be at least a 15-minute wait. I'll wait. Okay. Hmm... Your table is ready. Would you like to order a drink? Uh, I'll just have water, please. Okay. Would you like to order? Actually, you know, I'll need a few more minutes. Okay. "Noxana Hotel." Shit, that's downtown. Would you like to order yet? Uh... You know what? Thank you. Thank you! 105 blocked. Detour available. ...the Los Angeles river as a seasonal freeway. Talking of freeways, there's a big alert... Show... Show LA. River. Phone call, LAPD-- Detective Jefferson. Call to LAPD. Connected. You remember me? Yes. My kidnapper called me. He's blackmailing me to act as a courier for him. That's what the operation was about. The thing he put inside me is full of acid. Of course... If you believe him. Just send someone over to the Noxana Hotel. That's where I'm headed. Hmm. And what might you be delivering? This. That could be a bomb. Stop the car, get out, wait for the police ADF Unit to arrive. No way! Look, I could be dead already just from talking to you, all right? Now, I'm gonna make the delivery. After that, it's your problem. Whoa! Go to room 377, and you'll find some real evidence to work with. You are in clear violation of California public safety law if you continue to ignore my instructions. Book me, all right? End. End. Enter. Nice driving. I hope you didn't do any damage to your precious car. If you did the job clean, I'll call you and tell you how to remove that nasty little sack from your stomach. However, if you ignored any of my detailed instructions, you can look forward to a very nasty tummy ache. Will collagen doctor four please call implants, lab 15, station 22. Doing a good job, Christian. Thank you. What's the matter with you today? Buck. What's wrong with Buck? He missed our lunch date. Oh, God. What?No, I'm sure it's nothing. What? Lay down, sweetie. Go ahead, lay down. Well, you remember that time, that brief, you know, affair that I told you about? Well, you see, it took me so long to figure it out because he was fucking her on his lunch hour. Really? I'm sure it's nothing. No, it's not. Hmm. Must be love. Yeah, it is. Okay, we're all done. Good job. Thank you. Phone call. I hope you enjoyed your secret lunchtime rendezvous. I certainly found it educational. I think we need to talk. I'm going to print an expose entitled The Microscopic Cover-Up. How much I reveal about your covert activities depends on you. Meet me at the Bradley at 9:55 p.m. Fini. End. Erase. Phone call. Phone call. Camera off. Mr. Corgan, please. I'm here. Mr. Corgan, two of our police officers made a thorough search of room 377 at 6:30 this evening. But nothing was found. Well, what about the blackmailer's message? Nothing unusual was found. I suggest you restrain yourself from calling us until you have real hard evidence. As you requested, I have indeed booked you. You will be receiving a citation for negligent disregard for a police officer's instruction. End. Your Calcop account has been debited... 17 C.C. Thank you for using the LAPD. Don't drink alcohol. Don't buy guns. Don't smoke. Racism is a felony. End. Sit down, Buck. Brad had a call from Oromitshu yesterday. Said they heard from an undisclosed source that we had a problem. Understandably, they wanted to withdraw their financial support. What I'd like to know is who told them we had a problem? Well, why ask me? That journalist Melinda was in here earlier, said she saw a dead cat in the lab. When she asked you, uh, how it died, you said, "the profit motive." That was off the record. What else are you saying to people off the record? Nothing. Then where the hell were you yesterday afternoon? I was in the hospital. I was having tests. Tests? Buck, when I was your age, I hit kind of a crisis. I was selling payroll software to financial institutions. One day I asked myself, "Where am I going? What am I doing? "I mean, what's the point of always chasing money?" So that night, I found myself standing at a bookstore, standing and staring at all these books, wondering if I should quit. And I saw this book by John Lennon. So I picked it up and opened it up randomly. And there was this quote by Lennon. It said, "life is a shit sandwich. "The more bread you got, "the less shit you eat." Suddenly, I saw the light. Yeah, well, you can eat all the shit you want, but I don't have to. Now, if you need me, I'll be at the Pasadena Medical Plaza having endocrine tests. Have a nice day. Is it just me? Or do you want to kill him, too? So it's changed shape. Yeah, I know. We're going to give you an endoscopic probe in half an hour. Dr. Braunmann's the best. You can't just remove it? No. It's synthesized with the surrounding organ tissues, the liver, stomach, pancreas. So it's growing into me. Well, we don't know yet. It's undergoing some kind of metamorphosis. We don't know how to remove it yet. It's no good news this time. Well, it's not nitric acid. Phone call, Buck Corgan. Pick up. You know, you're wasting your time at that place. If you want to get rid of it, you should be at the Southern California Design Center. What did you put inside-- Don't yell at me. This is my show, understand? Okay. Now, in the east wing men's room, in the furthest cubicle, you'll find a package containing the chemical neutralizing agent that'll dissolve that sack safely. Be there in 20 minutes. I got to go.I'm coming with you. No way. I'll only be five minutes. Any longer, I'm coming to get you. The 1980s saw the birth of what later became known as the Rectangular Years, due to the overriding aesthetic proponents of the line. Auto-optical stylists from around the world competed in the Yuppie Years to create the essence of the '80s. Meanwhile, auto-optical radicals were busy defying the norm by their bold use of spheres, mobiles and organic shapes. ...defying the norm by their bold use of spheres, mobiles and organic shapes, throwing the deconstructionist rectangular designers into a radical rethink of their original theories. Come here! Come here! Are you following me? Of course I'm following you. Why is it empty? Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Am I on time, huh? Look, I don't know what you're talking about. I thought you were my john. Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! Call 911! It's guava juice. You hungry? Mail and messages. Play messages. What's the matter? Don't you like me? It's a pity you stood me up last night. I may have been able to work something out with you... Financially. You're not the first disgruntled research scientist to sell secrets to your competitor. I come across this kind of thing all the time. To me, it makes a great story. But for you, well, you've got a little more at stake. I'm interested to see how your bosses will respond to this video clip. You could've been a great inside informer, but for now, well... It's anybody's guess. Termini. Second message. Buck, I don't know where you are. You left the hospital hours ago, but-- But, anyway, I guess this message will set everything straight. I saw something today I wish I hadn't seen. And now I have no other option left open to me-- Fast forward. Blank. An e-mail follows this message with all the legal stuff. End. End.Open mail. Phone call. Phone call. Phone call. Pick up. I told you not to go to the cops... But you did. And that pissed me off.Where is Angel? I don't want to hurt her. It's not part of the plan, but-- So don't make me do anything silly. I can guarantee you that if you do anything silly to her, I will come after you, I will find you, I will do something totally and completely insane to you. Do you hear me? Your next pick up will be from the METRANS building. Why don't you just start by telling me what this thing is, because acid doesn't change shape. Go to will call at 12 noon and don't be late. What is this thing inside me?! If you do this correctly, then it's over. And you won't hear from me again, okay? And she'll be released unharmed, and you'll-- You'll be fine. You expect me to believe you after you told me to pick up this package that had a neutralizing agent just so you could kidnap Angeline? I'm supposed to believe you, you idiot? You idiot! Because you went to the cops... After I told you not to! That's why. So you had to learn. You all have to learn the hard way. I'm the boss now. I'm the boss. End. End. Freeze, right there. Dewayne? Jesus, put the gun down. I'm sorry, Mr. Corgan, I got orders. I can't let you on the premises. Remember that vacation in Cancun that you couldn't afford? So what's next? You look like you have a plan. I have a very important plan. So what's your psychological dysfunction, huh? I don't know. Well, let me guess. You're a 47-year-old virgin that's hung like a mouse, and gets sexually excited when he plays doctors and nurses. Probably live with your mother, don't you? Probably fuck your mother. I'm sorry. I'm-- I'm... I'm sorry, I... I didn't mean to do that. I didn't-- It's not my intention to hurt you. I just felt... You said that about-- My mother's dead. She died in, in a car wreck. My, my little brother Paul, he died, too. He was 9. I was 11. I, I was there, but I, I didn't die because, uh... I was a coward. My little brother and I were arguing 'cause I always got to sit in the front seat, because I was-- I was old enough, and I deserved it. We went to the gas station to get gas. We got hit by this truck. And my-- My mother... Her head hit the steering wheel, and she didn't make a sound. My brother was screaming, and the-- The car caught fire, and I opened the door, I jumped out. I remember my brother was shouting something. And I was standing away from the car, watching it. I was so scared, and I couldn't move. And he was trying to get out of the car and couldn't because his legs were trapped. And then the car blew up. The car just blew up. Because, you see, that particular make of automobile was later shown to be very dangerous in rear-end collisions. Deadly, in fact. So when the car company ran the numbers, the figures, they found that it would cost $137 million to replace the deadly gas tanks. But only $50 million to pay out in lawsuits. I was one of the people that they paid out to. So... When you said that about my mother... I got angry and I hit you. I'm sorry. Oh, no. Your fiance's final dose. I love you. Where is he? There he is. There he is. He's there. He's there. He's there. Good. Good. Need to collect a package. Name? Corgan. Buck Corgan. What's he doing? What's he doing? It's a nice security system. Hmm. I don't have color camera so, um... What are you talking about? Of course, it's color. What's going on? What's he have in his hands? Uh, sir, you have to sign for that. No, you do it. I trust you. He's wearing gloves. Phone call. Where is he? Phone call. Where is he? Why doesn't he answer? Where is he? Why doesn't he answer? Phone call. Phone call. Why doesn't he answer? Damn! Visitor. Malcolm? Why? Why? A gun? Are you mad? You all right? He's got a gun. Don't worry about him. I took care of him. You're gonna have to cut me out. Look, look over there. Hurry. It's Malcolm. Our Malcolm? He said today was your final dose, what did he mean? He's been feeding me nano-engines. What? This thing inside me, it isn't growing. It's being constructed. Come on, let's go. Okay. Where you going? Huh? Where you going? Pick that package up. I said pick it up. Good. Good. Good. Good. Now, get in the car. Get in the car and drive. Get in. Now drive. Don't worry. We'll be all right. So our success with Smoky here is just the starting point what could well be the fastest growing industry this century. Can you tell us a little bit about the process. Yes, this is the same process that can turn a car tire into a slab of prime steak, or literally turn a spare tire into prime beef cake. I see you haven't tried the test on yourself. Just kidding. Have there been any technical difficulties? Well, in every scientific endeavor there has to be a margin for error. So, then you're familiar with the term, "Science advances funeral by funeral"? Shall we go on to the lab? Why are you doing this? Because I care about what happens. Care? You're a terrorist. Sometimes, hat's the only way. It's never the only way. Look, there's a feeding frenzy for nanotechnology, nobody's saying slow down. Go. Unit 452, what's your 20? Unit 452, over? Take your time, buddy. Look out! He blew the light.I see him. That was a red light. Calling 923 in pursuit of green Riot heading westbound. Now the cops are following us. This guy's now run about three or four lights, we're gonna need all units back up. You better drive straight, 'cause if they catch us, you're both dead. And so are you. All units, IR. All units respond. HSC in progress. Westbound. Unit 455 in pursuit of 011, Riot. Westbound on 2nd street. Do you have OBV? What's going on? It's going westbound on 10th now. Westbound on 10th. You like what you started, Malcolm? Enjoying this? Hey, I didn't start anything. It's the, the greedy bastards, that, that lawyers, your money man, your bean counters. Slow down! This guy's going 70. 80, he's blowing all the lights. Idiot! Are you trying to get us killed? They're turning into a business park. I think this is a dead-end. They're gonna bail. Their gonna bail in this business park. Pick up the camera and follow me. Give me the best, fucking footage of your life. I said pick it up! Go, Johnny, kill 2, up link this feed to COMSAT 7. Move! Police! Freeze! Welcome to Nano Lab. Put it down, Dewayne, everything will be okay. Just put it down. Malcolm's gone nuts, just do as he says. That's right, I've gone nuts. Give me that gun, Dewayne, or I'm gonna blow her head off. Open the door, now! Give him the gun. Back off, Mr. Corgan. Open the door, now!If you open the door, there will be a full on shoot out. Security guard, open the door now! Security guard, do not give up your weapon. Give me the gun! Give him the gun.POLICEMAN 1: Do not give him your... Slide it over here, Dewayne. Don't you dare. Do not give up your gun! Open the door!Cuff yourself to that pole. That's an order. Drop it, that's an order. Throw that key over here. Where are the TV cameras? Where are the TV cameras? In the quarantine lab. Great. Let's go. Go. Shut up. Shut up! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Jerry Clark. Jerry Clark. Which one is it? The yellow one. The one next to the red one. Jerry Clark. Jerry Clark. They went that way. What's going on out here? Malcolm, what are you doing? I oughta shoot you right now. There's a very important press event going on down there. Put the gun down, Malcolm. Okay. I'm sorry. I'll put the gun down now. Bean counter! Malcolm! Shut up. Go! Go! Come on! What you're about to see is my latest infomercial... Don't move. This is a live demonstration. Hi, Donald. Hi. How are you? Okay. I'll bet you're surprised, huh? Yes, actually I am. Talking to the press, huh?DONALD: Yeah. I'll bet you're telling them about your revolutionary cancer-reversal technology. Yeah. Are you telling them how we haven't had enough time for the proper research and that humans are going to die? That human beings, that human lives are in danger because you're greedy? Well, I'll tell them. I'll tell them for you. How's that? Because I don't think you're going to tell them everything, Donald. Because I think you... Hey! This is for your benefit! Don't you want to hear the truth? You're supposed to tell the truth, you're a journalist. Malcolm is an employee of ours. Malcolm, whatever the problem is, we can work it out... Shut up, Donald.DONALD: All right. You're the problem, okay? Because I'm the boss now. Get behind that desk. Stay there. You're the boss. You want to know the truth? We tried this out on lab animals and actually caused cancer, and yet today he wants to try it out on human subjects. All for the all-mighty dollar. Isn't that right, Donald? Come here. - Incorrect code. - Try again. Put the gun down. Drop your weapon or I'll shoot. I'm warning you. Put the gun down. Drop your weapon or I will shoot. Stay back. Stay back. Open it. Stay back. Get out of the way. Johnny, you got a lock? Any second. Stay back. Gunman, drop your weapon. Stay back. That's an order! Drop it! You, with the camera, get out of the way. Point the camera here. Shit. Point it in here. Someone's gotta open this door. This is Melinda Clark reporting live. An employee armed-standoff at Nanolab Industries. Is it on?
