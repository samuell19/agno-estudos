A Letter Of Resignation What the hell is this?! If I fail next time, I'll quit. Are you serious? I'm Always serious. Excuse me. CAT'S EYE Coffee Shop Welcome, Toshio-san. Rui-san, give me the usual. I heard they showed up again. Those thieves... They're scary, aren't they? Schoolgirls' New Hero!! Hats Off To Cat's Eye! Yokohama Sports News He stole items on the time he forwarned. Cat's Eye...How cool can you get?! Right, Toshio-san? Schoolgirls' New Hero!! Big Scoop Illustration Cat's Eye! Wow! Cool!! Schoolgirls' New Hero? What are they thinking?! They're just thieves!! What are they thinking? What a world we live in... What are you mumbling about? Here. Your usual. What? What is it? That face, Toshio… You were chewed out by the Chief again. Noisy, nosy. Annoying. Why don't you quit the force? Being a cop doesn't fit your image, Toshio. Hey, that's my decision to make. Stop shooting your mouth off. Ouch! You... I'm just worried just because you are a classmate of mine. You're such a jerk, Toshio! Hmph! Don't Hmph me! Don't make me arrest you! They must be pretty intimate, as they fight all the time. Right, Rui-neesan. Yes. They've been like that since high school. I want a boyfriend with whom I can fight just so that making-up becomes memorable. Ai, you'll be late for school. Yeah, you're right! Toshio-san? eh? Do you wanna go on a date with me? Eh? Ai!! See Ya!! Take care! Toshio-san! eh? Hitomi's upset... 'Cause you haven't asked her out lately. You think so? Of course! On your next day off, Will you take Hitomi out? Pretty please! I see... Here you are. Thank you. What a reflex! Just like a clasp-knife reflex in the cat. It doesn't feel right... This is not America... Japanese cops don't need guns! You're right! A ball is better for catching cats. You're a detective Utsumi. Right? And you are? I belong to the INTERPOL Division at Tokyo Metropolitan Police. My name is Asatani Mitsuko. What does INTERPOL want from me? Would you like to know who Cat's Eye really is? The identity of Cat's Eye? Sure, tell me. Will you help me? I knew there was a catch. So, what do you want from me? Until I'm done with my investigation, I want you to stop yours. What are you talking about? That's impossible. I must be the one to catch Cat's Eye. We need Cat's Eye to arrest the Ko-Ryu-Dan. Ko-Ryu-Dan? It's an international Crime Syndicate. They're after Cat's Eye. I won't let people like them interfere. If Cat's Eye is around, Ko-Ryu-Dan will definitely show up. I see. Using the Cat to lure out the Dragons... I'll catch the Dragons. You arrest the Cat. I got it. This conversation never happened. Don't you want to know who Cat's Eye really is? I'll find my own answers. You should do the same. I hate curve balls. Welcome, Welcome! What do you want? I've brought the Emperor with me. Out of my way! I can't let anyone in! What? I'm the boss here! I must speak to the Emperor. Get out of my way! Out of my way! Miss Wong's orders are absolute! MY orders are absolute! Out of my way! You dare disobey me, Yan? Miss Wong, you've risen high in rank. But, you are still under my orders here! The Emperor made me the new boss here. Bitch! I'll kill you! How scary... I'm really scared... You think you can kill me? Black Flag! Kill them all! It's perfect. Strange... Watch out! Thank you. Who are you? I'm an exchange student. My name is Lee. A date out of the blue… Rui-neesan said something to you, didn't she? She didn't say anything at all... Where are we going, anyway? Don't worry about it. Just be quiet and tag along. Do I have a choice? I'm speeding up. Hang on. Hey, Lee-kun! How come you came to Japan? My father was in Japan before. Oh, I see. But, I know very little about Japan. Now that you are in Japan, Instead of hanging out at college all the time, You should go out more. But, my Japanese is terrible... Okay then, I'll show you around! Will you really? We used to come here a lot in high school. Toshio! Why did you become a cop? Eh? You said you were going to be a baseball player. So you don't like cops? I hate them! Well, then... If I quit the force, Will you marry me? What is this? Just open it. Hold on to it for me. Toshio... I've already decided. After I arrest Cat's Eye… I'll quit the force. What does your father do, Lee-kun? My father used to paint. Your father is an artist, too? Mine is, too! Really?! Yeah. But, he's not around anymore. How come? When I was a baby, He disappeared. Did he die? Nope. I'm sure my father is still alive. That's what I believe. What's wrong, Lee-kun? I was praying to God. What for? Someday…Ai-san ...can meet your father. Can I? No problem. My God will let you meet your father. Sorry I'm late. This is Umehara's Collection Room. This entire room is one big safe. Father's self-portrait is in there? Yes. Ai... You can crack the security lock of this safe. Right! Sure thing. There's no safe I can't crack. Hitomi, you ask Toshio-san about the security matters. What's wrong, Hitomi? Toshio proposed to me. What an uncool ring! So, Hitomi-neesan, are you gonna accept his proposal? And your husband-to-be is... It's okay. This "Uncoolness" is Toshio to me. 3 more paintings to go. Then we'll have all of father's paintings back. Hitomi... Until then,Toshio-san is... Cat's Eye's foe. I know all about it, Rui-neesan. A thief marrying a cop… It isn't possible... My Emperor... Black Flag Go and kill Cat's Eye! Tonight At Midnight We claim of ownership of the 7th Kuroda Collection!! Mihara-san, You're interfering with this operation. I'll protect the painting. Can't you just go over there where it's much safer? No way!! This painting has 100,000,000 yen price tag on it. Until midnight comes and goes, I'll just hold on to it. Besides, this is the safest room in the house. This whole room is one big safe. Like I said, Cat's Eye can easily open this safe. Why are you so stubborn? Shut up! Your job is to catch the cat burglar before it gets here! Anyhow, I'm staying right here!! Now leave! Be careful! Leave! Just leave! Umehara-san! Watch it! Dammit! You Octopus head!! The police is not your private guards! Who's there?! Is it already midnight? Time is running too fast? Detective Utsumi! What?! It's Cat's Eye! Huh? Wait! Don't leave your posts. Yes, Sir! Damn you! Goddamn it! It's a trap. Ai. We cancel the plan. What about our father's Self-portrait painting? If we took the painting, We would be blamed for Umehara's death. We must go back, Ai. Ai... Give it up! No, I can't. It's our Father's Self-Portrait! Ai! Father... Ai! Run! Run, Cat's Eye! We'll meet later! Who was that? It wasn't the Cat. Ko-Ryu-Dan's assassin... Black Flag Show me your hands! Why didn't you kill them? I can't kill that girl. You can't obey my order?! You bastard child! Black Flag... My son... Please understand... This is all for you. If you kill Cat's Eye and the Emperor... ...you'll be the only remaining blood relative to the Emperor. Which means... You'll be the new Emperor. Mother, you're the one who wants to become the Emperor. I don't wish to be the Emperor! I'll kill Cat's Eye myself. And then.... I'll make you the Emperor! Death Threat by Cat's Eye?! Umehara-san, Yokohama was murdered at Midnight on June 05... As such, Cat's Eye investigation has now been assigned to the 1st section from the 3rd section. But Chief! The Cat's didn't do this murder. Because I saw the killer myself. Utsumi! Yes? Don't stick your nose in other section's business. Apart from that, What are you going to do about this? I can't quit now like this. Give it back. I'm Asatani Mitsuko from INTERPOL So you know who we are... Yes. You are the daughters of Kuroda Ryutaro who was kidnapped 20 years ago. Why did you help us? Cat's Eye is stealing Kuroda Collections... To find out whereabouts of your father. Father's paintings were stolen… and our mother was killed. I am after Ko-Ryu-Dan. Ko-Ryu-Dan? A Chinese Secret Crime Syndicate lead by the Ryu family. Ko-Ryu-Dan is trying to rebuild its Fallen Empire. Ko-Ryu-Dan kidnapped our father. Is that it? Painter Kuroda is in Yokohama. What?! Father?! Father is alive? There is a man forced to paint the portrait of the Emperor in Yokohama. That man! It has to be Father! We have to rescue him, Neesan. What are you gonna do? Ko-Ryu-Dan is brutal. Just like yesterday's assassin. Even with a cat's claws… We can slash up a dragon's eye. Hey, you two, let's go find Father right now! Ko-Ryu-Dan is powerful. To fight, we need a solid plan first. I agree with Rui-neesan. Since we were attacked by their assassin, They must be watching our movements. We must study how they move. I can't wait! If they're after us, then let's take the fight to them! It's too dangerous. Anyway, we should… No! I'll go alone if I have to. Ai! Ai!! Ai! Ai!! Rui-neesan! Before Ko-Ryu-Dan attacks Ai, We must do something fast. Ai's in danger. I'll find their information immediately. Hitomi, You find a way to get in the place. When Father was kidnapped, I was just a year old. That's why I don't remember his face. I want to see my father's face, too. Cat's Eye… I'll lure you into my trap… and kill you one by one. Father... Lee-kun... This man... This is Ai-san's father? Yeah. I know this man. What? Come with me, Ai-san. You wait here. Sure. Please calm your anger. We will deliver the Eye of the Dragon without fail. Ai (0 year old) Father? Father! Father! Ai? Father! Father... Father!! Are you looking for someone, young girl? You're so cute. I'll treat you well... ...like this rose. How did it go, Rui-neesan? In the corner of Chinatown There is a small a rundown store. That's Ko-Ryu-Dan's Exchange Front. I got it. Hitomi… About our father... There is a secret I've kept a long time. Our father's secret? I understand. Let's go. Father! Stop! You agreed not to kill my daughter. Mother! Mother!! Rui... Without fail... You must not look for your father. Your father... Your father does not exist any more... We must not look for our father. I am Mrs. Gardener. I have an appointment with Miss Wong. Mrs. Gardener Where's the stuff you want to show me? So, Mrs. Gardener… Tell me the details about the Kuroda's Collection. It was stolen from our home. I want to see my father now! Bring him! Mr. Kuroda, Could you possibly show us your face, please? Good girl… Let me see… Which cat... is hiding here? Ai! Run! Father? It is you, Father, right? I'm Hitomi! I've come to rescue you! Together, Let's get the hell out of here! I... I won't run away. What are you talking about, Father? If I escape, You will all be killed. You must escape alone. Father! Father... Father! Father!! Miss Wong, what kind of face would you like today? Make me look like a cat. Ai! Rui-neesan, we must rescue Hitomi-neesan. Father was in there! I saw him with my own eyes! Hitomi, you saw him, too? Yes. Father is trapped. Let's go and rescue him again! This time we need a new plan that will definitely work. Ai... What's this? I have no idea. Hello, Cat's Eye... If you really want your Daddy back, Listen carefully. I'm willing to trade him for the Eye of the Dragon in the King Foundation. Your deadline is twelve midnight, tomorrow. So, better hurry. The King Foundation. Supposedly, It's a foundation owned by Arabic smuggler All guards are real Army soldiers. Breaking in there is near impossible. There's no time argue. Father's life is in danger! I agree with Ai! This is a trap that's set up for us. I don't care if it's a trap or not! I disagree. Rui-neesan... Don't you want to save Father? Rui-neesan, we have to give it a try. We can't save him unless all three of us go! Father... I'll rescue you no matter what. I won't forgive him. My Emperor! Miss Wong will bring the Eye of the Dragon shortly. Miss Wong is disguising herself as you, Cat's Eye. Ai and Rui-neesan are in danger. I have a plan. A plan? Will you partner up with me? No one has come out alive after breaking into the King Foundation. Cat's Eye will be dead. And the Eye of the Dragon will be mine. If I can get the Eye of the Dragon, and kill the Emperor... Black Flag will become the new Emperor. The Kings Foundation Japanese Police Officer? What is it that you want? Tonight, Cat's Eye will break into this place. Cat's Eye always leaves a notice first. We haven't heard from them, Sir. No mistakes in my investigation. Let me secure this area. The defense of this foundation has nothing to do with the Japanese Police. Please leave quietly. That has nothing to do with me. Don't come back again! Dammit! I won't give up! Rat-kun, I'm counting on you. Thanks for the directions, Rat-kun. They stole the Eye of the Dragon! Don't harm the Eye of the Dragon! Ai! Give back what you stole. Kill them! I've finally caught you, Cat's Eye. Now I can marry Hitomi. Hitomi? This can't be... There's no way... Did you expect me to go that way? I already told you, Disguises won't fool me. And Hitomi's eyes aren't so evil! Who the hell are you? Cat's Eye, you're under arrest for Serial Burglary Charges. Oh? Really? Why? Come on, boy. What? The Eye of the Dragon is mine at last. Nice catch. What the heck is this? I have to ask you quite a lot of questions, Miss Wong. You want to shoot me? Come on! You will never touch me! Let's leave the rest to Hitomi. What's this? Shit! Damn cat again. Okay, Miss Wong... Take us to our father. Right Now! Or he's dead! Your father? Okay, let me tell you where your father is. It's okay... I've... killed too many... Lee-kun! This is the father you've been looking for. Don't search for your father. I won't run! A secret about Father? Father! Father! Hitomi... Father is in the helicopter, correct? Neesan... Mother... Black Flag! Why? Black Flag! Black Flag! Goodbye, Ai-san. Lee-kun! This is Asatani Mitsuko of INTERPOL. The Ko-Ryu-Dan are getting away in a helicopter. Please track their course. We'll meet again, Cat's Eye. What the hell is going on here? What's this ball anyway?
