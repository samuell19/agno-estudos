I never went to church in Belgium, so why would I start going here? For the community. Besides, I reckon you're no saint, Phil. Hang on, I'm not a saint... I'm not a criminal either... I'm just a normal guy. We're all normal guys here, but we go to church on a Sunday, all the same. If... If I do come to church one day, I'll be there to look at your women. They're beautiful when they wear hats at the church. They don't wear hats to be beautiful. Well, why do they have to wear hats on a Sunday? Women wear hats on a Sunday because it's always been like that. And it always will be like that. - But what about the wind? - What about it? - When it's windy? - It's always windy. - On a Sunday... - On a Sunday? - When it's windy on a Sunday. - What do you mean? - Why do they have to? - Because they have to. Why? Because it's difficult to wear hats when it's windy. It's Sunday Phil... Your questions are weird, man I'm gonna go to the beach tomorrow. Wanna come with me? Not on a Sunday. Keep it straight. Hey Brian, Phil. I give all my best to your father. And tell him I got a bunch of... a bunch of... of fence posts to sell. - I'll let him know. - He seemed to be interested. - Give my best to Angus too. - Yeah. And to the Ice Queen. - To the Ice Queen? - Auntie Millie. - Why? - It's a stupid nickname. - Yeah, but why 'Ice Queen'? - Because people are stupid. People think she's cold. And she's single so... It's a small island, so someone tasks you a stupid nickname and it sticks. I didn't know people called her like that. It's not very friendly. I know. I want to concentrate today a little on this particular verse, in chapter 2 verse 20. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I now live in the body, I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. I have been crucified with Christ... What does that mean? I have been crucified with Christ? Well, if you are safe today, the apostle Paul says that when the lord Jesus Christ died on the cross then you died with him. It was then, that the wages of sin and the wages of sin his death were paid forever in for by Christ on our behalf. And that's why now we need never fear death. We have already experienced it and it no longer retains any power over us. The cross was the end of my old self. The sinful and evil eye, right in the middle of sin, has gone. I have been crucified with Christ. And I, the old self no longer live. Auntie Millie! Phil has had a stroke. They took him to Inverness. Phil has had a stroke. Phil has had a stroke. How did they take him to Inverness? By boat? - By plane. - He had a heart attack? No... it was a stroke they told me. - Can you survive a stroke? - Yeah, if you're lucky... But you might as well end up like a plant, it depends. Or lose one side... get paralyzed... lose your speech. Raigmore Hospital, Inverness. Hello... I'm looking for information please... on Phillipe Haubin. - Can you spell that for me? - H.A.U.B.I.N. Just a moment... I'll pass you on to the neurology unit. So, in short, there doesn't seem to be any irreversible damage, and with regards to the amnesia, it's likely just temporary. Although we can't be completely sure yet. We need to see how it develops. I'm sure you can appreciate that each case is different. Firstly, he'll need to get his old life back little by little. Avoiding excesses of course. And then he'll need to come back for more tests in a few weeks, but we'll notify you first. You're his next of kin so we have your contact details. And if you notice the slightest change in attitude, speaking disorder, his balance... you should contact the emergency services straight away. Mister Haubin? The person that was supposed to pick you up couldn't make it I was told. Fortunately, I recognized the number of the hospital. But usually, I'm off duty by now. Gentil, gentil, gentil... - Millie Macpherson. - Hello, this is Raigmore hospital. Just calling to let you know that Phillipe Haubin has been released. - When? - Last night. Okay, right... Yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bloody unbelievable. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! Phil... I'm so sorry. I was meant to collect you yesterday, but the hospital forgot to ring me. You're OK? - Yes. - Good. Excuse me, who are you? I'm Millie, your reference person. It's freezing out here... Put on some clothes and I'll see you outside. Okay. Excuse me, what's your name again? Millie. And the hospital sent you to me? No, we knew each other... before your stroke. You work at my father's farm. With my brother and nephew. I'm a friend. Good. Would you like to do something? Go somewhere? Yes. This is Peter, my brother. That's Brian, his son. This is my father, Angus. He's alright. Go on with your work. Morning. Here... Have you guys have seen Jason Bourne? Come on, you must have seen Jason Bourne. It's like exactly the same kind of set up. They ... They find him and he can't remember anything, so he goes around and he's trying to remember who he is... but you don't know, and he doesn't know... - We all know it's Phil. - Yes, well... Whatever. Hey, hope you haven't forgotten about that 200 pounds you owe me. Brian, that's enough. Oh, come on, I'm just having some crack with him. You got it? Well done lads. 1, 2, 3... How did he get on? Alright... He doesn't talk as much as he used to. Which is good. Brian has been talking with him all day long instead of working. Hey... Come on I'll give you a lift home. Your father doesn't like me. The work we did today... We do it every day? Mainly mending fences and looking after sheep. Why do I live on this island? You have a tattoo of Scotland on your right arm. - Do I have a car? - Yes, but you're not allowed to drive. - What dog? - My dog. You don't have a dog. Of course, I have a dog. He was here when I came back from the hospital. - Are you sure it's not my dog? - You've never mentioned a dog. Do I have any other friends? I mean apart from you? The whole island knows who you are. The whole island? Oh, so I'm famous? It's your mother. She had passed away. That's what you told us. Do I have any other family? You have a brother. But you don't speak. Why? You never explained. And this is me. What else did I forget? Have you checked your mobile? So, I know all these people? I don't see many pictures with you in them. I don't like to be photographed. Why? Why? It's a shame you don't like to be photographed. You are very photogenic. Look. Why did you take those? Brian will collect you tomorrow morning. We need to fix a few of the fences. Lambing will be early this year, everything's early. Angus is worried those gaps the lambs will get through unless we fix them up. What's with the dog? - It's a dog. - Well, your dog? Hey! Are you? Are you my dog? Yeah? My dog. - What, seriously? He is really your dog? - Your auntie says no. - Can we take him along with us? - Of course, we can. - Really? - Yeah. Nigel come on. Come on Nigel. - Alright to go upstairs? - Yes, of course. You've had enough of Glasgow Molly? Yes, I've been wanting to come home for a while. David wasn't too keen but... Now all the children have left home, I've managed to convince him. - How many do you have? - Three, two girls and a boy. The youngest, she just left college and she's moving in with her boyfriend. The other two are in London. And you? Oh, everything's good. Do you have children? No. - Do you mind if I go upstairs? - No, help yourself. Look at him. A real tourist dog. So, it's your dog now is it? Yes... I guess. You guess? Well, you won't mind if I tell you not to bring her around here. Why? - He's playing with my dog. - They get along that's good. No, it's not good. My dog's a working dog. Yours is a pet. You know how long it takes to train a dog? I don't want him anywhere near my dog. He'll get the bad habits. Foreign habits. Brought you dinner. Thanks. Hi Beverly. Where are you? - At the Mcnee's house. - Still? Still. I was waiting for you to call. Do you know the time? Yes, I should have called. So, I guess I'll have to stay here over lunch then. - Yes. - Aye okay. Beverly, I won't be in this afternoon. I'll see you tomorrow. Hello. That's 7,99 please. Aye. Thank you. Thank you. Millie... - Can I come in? - Yeah. - Do you have something to drink? - Of course. I have the feeling that I annoyed you yesterday with all my questions, the things about the pictures, I'm sorry about-- We were together. What do you mean together? Together... like... people who... are together. You mean... like a couple? Almost. Almost? We were lovers. But... are we still together? - Yes. I'm sorry. No. - No, no, wait, wait, wait. Please, don't mention this to anyone. But ... Can I call you? We sold the house, over on Gravir. Phil... Can I talk to you about something? Nigel is not really your dog, right? What do you exactly want Brian? I'd like to look after Nigel. I'd like him to be my dog, my own dog. Millie! What are you doing here? - I was waiting for you. - How did you know where I worked? I ask to Brian. - Did he drive you here? - No. I came with my car. Phil, you know you are not allowed to drive. I had no news. And you didn't answer to my messages. This is all my fault. I... shouldn't have told you. Why? Because I... Because it's wrong. - It's wrong? - Because you're ill. We can't have a relationship. It's not right. But we had a relationship before? Yes. And you want to stop it just because I've lost my memory? - Yes. - Help me Millie. No, I am helping you. No, at his moment you're not helping me. - Phil please, don't do this... - You are in my mind now. - In my mind all the time, all the time. - Phil, please listen to me ... please. This is wrong. I should never have told you. Please, we can't do this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. How long? I mean you and I? How long? A few months. And nobody knows it? I don't know what it all means. - Do you know? - No. I never told you about them? Not all of them. About this one? No. And about this one? No. This one. It's you. You said that's how you wanted to be... barefooted, relaxed, enjoying the moment. He looks like you. Why can nobody know about us? - Hey. - I was waiting for you to call. I'm sorry Beverly. Viewings are... viewings are not part of my job. I'm freezing. What? Are you gonna at least say something? What about my lunch break? What the hell is wrong with you? There is nothing wrong with me Beverly. First time in a long time, there is nothing wrong with me. Now go on and have your lunch break. Every Christian learns that the more he or she grows in Christ, the more he or she becomes aware of sin in their lives, but he or she also knows and becomes more aware of Christ, who takes away our sins, who has imparted to us the power to resist sin. In this present life of course, sin will always be a powerful force for the Christians to reckon with. But it's no longer our Master, no longer the Lord of our lives. And it must and can be resisted. Sin is personified by Paul. Stop looking at me. Have we been here together before? Yes. It's beautiful. Have you seen the color? And this beach is amazing. And there is no one! It's Sunday. It's really a pity that I cannot swim in this water. Do you think it's really cold? - It's not so cold. - Phil, it's freezing. No, really, it's not so cold. I go in it. Phil... you don't even have a towel! I'll dry with the wind and then I put my clothes and it's OK. You'll catch your death. Death? But I'm already dead, I died two weeks ago and I'm back and you cannot kill someone who has just been resurrected. Just give me one example in the Bible in which God kills someone who is just resurrected. Tell me. You can't? And since when do you know so much about the Bible? Yeah, I know but you have to admit, it would be stupid. So, it cannot be in the Bible. Phil, you don't even know if you can swim. I stop when the water comes here. Oh my god. It's freezing. It's really cold. Oh my god. It's really cold. The hospital called yesterday. They want you to go in for a check-up in Raigmore next Tuesday. - I don't want to go back to the hospital. - Well, I think you should go. Why? I'm fine Millie, look at me I'm fine. I don't want to go back. If I was supposed to die, I would be dead. And if I have to die, I'll die and it's all. Please don't say that Phil. Don't be afraid Millie. They did a lot of tests at the hospital last time and if I feel like something is going wrong, I will tell you directly. I promise you. I need to confirm the appointment. Just tell them... that I got my memory back, it's done. It's easy! Do you think that someone is looking at us? I hope not. I would like to take your hand. You've never asked how we got together. Don't you want to know? No. - Oh here, it's my turn. - You're right. Three. One, two, three. 300! Don Juan? Yes, Don Juan. Do you know it? Hello. I'm Millie McPherson, from the agency. Comme in. How was your journey? Hi Phil, when can we come and collect Nigel? Best, Norman. - Who are these people? - I don't know. I'm sorry, I didn't remember. I'm not giving him back. He's my dog. Yeah, okay but they certainly will come back so what am I going to tell them? I don't care. I'm not giving him back. Nigel! - Come on. That's it. Good boy. - Hey Brian? Brian! Hey Brian! Brian! Hi Millie, it's me. It's my fault. I shouldn't have given this dog to Brian. It was stupid. What can we do? If Nigel is their dog, they'll come back for him. - Hello Peter. - Brian is in the bothy. - When did he leave? - Just now. - Are you sure he's gone there? - Sure he is. Okay. Stupid dog. - You will go? - I'll go. Bye. Brian has taken Nigel to our bothy. Are you mad at me? No, why would I be mad at you? Because I forgot everything? It's not your fault. Come on, I'll take you home. Good boy! We could've lied and I could've kept Nigel. We could have kept him hidden when people came around. I've lied to Brian. I've lied to Phil. I told him that we were together before his stroke. Just so that I could be with him. What will you do when he finds out? I won't tell anyone. You have to give the dog back. I know. Isn't that terrible. Do you know Phil well? Oh, not really, but he is a good neighbour. He's kind. This is the first time we've asked him to look after the dog. Tea? I hear you took good care of Nigel. Thank you. And... you've grown to like him. Yes. This whole story bothers me. Nigel's still young, he needs to be active. I'm not getting any younger and the same goes for my wife. To be honest, if anything should ever to happen to my wife and myself, we'd be glad to know that someone would take care of him. - Could you do that? - Yes. And in the meantime, you can come and get him whenever you want. - How does that sound? - Good. Good? Done. Bye, bye. Thank you. You're okay? Yes. I see you later? See you later. I know you are in Scotland, call me. Benoît. Phil? Phil? We're almost done. We'll finish tomorrow. Aye. Tomorrow is Fergus's funeral. - Fergus's funeral? - Yes. He died? Yes. Tuesday. - You didn't think to tell me, no? - I thought you knew. I didn't. I probably should have mention it. Yes, you should have. We'll finish up later. Honestly, I think he doesn't give a shit. It's little things you know. Like talking about the football or 'How was your day?', 'Do you want to go out for a drink'. He just totally cut me out. You should talk to him. - What? - What you told to me. You're joking? My father thought I was a loser. That's the feeling I had. So, one day I decided to not talk to him anymore, never, and I left the house. I was young. And then he died. We never spoke again. But after the funeral, his friends came to me and they said that he was all the time talking about me. He was proud of me. So, talk to him now. After it will be too late, and you will have regrets. Take care. Fuck it! - This is also mine and you took it. - You didn't like it. They never should've fired the drummer. - They didn't fire him. - He was the soul of the band. No, the soul of the band was the bassist. No, it was the drummer. Besides, when they fired him, the band split. No, the band split because he didn't want to play the drums anymore. Yes, they fired him. No, he left because there was no more group because of him. That's right, you know everything. How did you find me? The Inverness Hospital contacted me. They are the ones who told me that you live here. I think the window above us all, the window that separate us from God is by nature a closed window. To be worthy of God's love, we, as humans must find a way to open that window. And sometimes it's the work of a lifetime. His entire life, a man must work toward this. And... Fergus did just that. That's what I'll say at the funeral. It's good. - Fergus would be happy. - Aye. I think he would be. Dram? Dram... oh, yeah why not. Brian? Were you with Phil? Has he got his memory back? Can we talk? The last time we tried to speak, it didn't go very well and then we decided to stop because it would be better for everyone. I don't know if you remember. Yes, but in the end there are priorities and health is a priority. The rest is bullshit we don't care about. OK. You could've told me that you had another stroke. I wanted to but I couldn't. Yes, that's what they told me. Did you really lose your memory this time? Yes. And how do you fell now? Good. - Are you fully recovered? - Yes. You seem to be fine. It seems you were lucky. If something happens to you in the middle of nowhere, you... I know. I know. Plus, you don't know anyone here. - It's not true. I know people. - But they are not family. There's nothing here. No hospital... Excuse me, but it's still the asshole of the world. Why don't you come home? We have room. I spoke about it with Agnès. You will have your own place. There will be always someone, if something happens to you. If you stay, you'll die here. You know that? You can't disappear like that every time... I don't want you to die here. I've came to take you back with me. I lost a good friend today. I'm glad you're here. Thank you. You're welcome. Have you seen the man just over there? With the peanuts? He sucks them up. I don't want to leave this world Millie. I'm fine here. I feel at home. Why would you want to leave? Because you lied to me. We've never been together before. But I'm not going to leave. I'm going to stay. Because I decided to stay until the end. And I refuse you to leave my life just because you're ashamed about your lie. I don't give a shit about your lie. It's good you lied to me, if you had not, there would have never happened something between us. I was in love with you before my stroke, but I was too shy to make a move. I want to stay with you. I want you to stay with me. I'm happy with you. I'm happy with you too. So why are we hiding? I'm so ashamed. No, don't be. I love you Millie. There's a dead sheep up there by the rocks. - How did it die? - Probably fell. We need to get the carcass back to the farm and bury it. - We'll finish this later. - Yeah. Are you sure you will be alright getting home? Just go. Auntie Millie ! Auntie Millie? How was it? A lot of people came. Everyone's wondering where you are Auntie Millie. Don't you worry about me. I know. I know. He said he would tell me when to give it to you but... Thank you. Millie, if you're reading this letter, that means Brian gave it to you. That means this time, I've gone for good. What we had together was not part of the plan. The doctors gave me very little time to live after my first stroke. That was in Belgium before I came here. They said I was doomed, but you offered me a second life. And even if it was much shorter than the first, it gave me much more happiness. Most of the records belong to my brother. I would like you to go to Belgium and give them back to him. I'd also like you to tell him that I love him and thank him for always carrying about me. I apologize for not listening to him, for leaving like that and for not staying in touch. But please tell him also that he must not have any regrets. Because I don't. Well I do, just one. That this is all over. I was happy Millie. As happy as I ever was. There is nothing on this world more beautiful than you and you deserve to be happy. I love you. Phil. Hello. We saw your car... We wanted to say we are sorry. Thank you. - Did he have any family? - Yes, he had a brother. - And he had friends? - Yes, and he had me. - Take care. - Thank you.
