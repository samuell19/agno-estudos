It was a long one today, I'll tell you that. Mm. There's cake in the break room. Somebody's birthday, I don't remember who. It's just one of them sheet cakes from Kroger, but, it's pretty good for a grocery store cake. You don't really look like you eat cake, though, do you? - I eat cake. - Mm. You know, my mama always said, "Never trust a skinny woman. While we're eating, they're plotting." Well, if you eat cake, how do you stay so little? You are skin and bones, girl. Smoking? Mm-mm, smoking don't make you thin. I smoke. You know, I never know if someone being quiet is a sign of ain't got nothing to say, or they ain't got nothing going on up here. You seem to have it altogether, though. - Money-wise, I mean. - How do you know that? 'Cause you come in here wearing some nice shoes. I've seen you wearing those Candies. Those aren't cheap. Well. Have a good shift, Mandy. Hey, Cathy. Yeah? Go fuck yourself. Oh, you're here. Okay, I'm very dizzy, okay? And I spoke to Karen, she's not listening to me. I need to talk to a doctor right away. What if I fall down and break a hip? What if I fall down and I crack my head - and get a staph infection? - Did you check in at this desk? Yes. - Mr. Kent... - Karen. I told you we will call you when we have a bed ready. You need to sit down. You know, it is hot in here, so I'm gonna wait outside until you're ready. And it better not rain. I don't like to be wet. You starting now? You should know, you scheduled me. - Oh, yes. - I'm about to work a double. Well, you may wanna start with 202. And you should probably go and get a soda. I don't drink soda. Karen, you know that. You got about 30 minutes. Chug it, chug it, chug. This is good to go. Can you believe our insides look like this? Like, that's our guts. Seems to me like it would all just come bubbling out of us sometimes. Like, "Oops, my pancreas just fell out." Regina. - Hmm? - Give me the money. Okay, but first, uh... let me show you something. This is what I like to do. I like to use the soda to keep 'em extra cold in here. I always say, "Keeping it cool is the key to my job." I made that up. And then I can drink 'em when I'm done, like it's a celebration. - I really don't care, Regina. - Look, we're family, right? I mean, how many cousins your age you got? - Cousins by marriage. - Right. And who knew we're into the same stuff? You know, the blood and organs and... We're not. The money, Regina. 'Cause Nicholas needs a kidney, like, right now. But I got held up. You know Wayne? He... he needed help with his science homework. You know they teach evolution in fifth grade now? - In public school? - Regina! Ah. Sorry. Now, was there a kidney, in that sack? Was there? I know what a damn kidney looks like. Like a bean? Kidney bean? Jesus. Grumpy ass bitch. Hey, bitch! Fuck your mom, asshole. Are you my mother's nurse? Was it you who told me that she was possibly in a coma? Were you here earlier? I just got here. Okay. Any idea when the results will be back from her tests? The doctor won't be back until tomorrow - to go over test results. - But are the test results here? I... don't see them here, ma'am. So am I just supposed to stay here all night? You don't have to. I'm sorry. It's just have a baby at home. And I help run my... my husband's business. You know the... the Catfish King over on South Grand? Mm-hmm. It's just I feel so guilty not staying in case she wakes up. She might be confused. She's got dementia or Alzheimer's or whatever they're calling it these days. If she doesn't know where she is, she can be... she can be real difficult and she's... she's very strong and... Is that your mother's overnight bag? Some of her personal things. I grabbed real quickly. You know, I just love that Catfish King. Mm! I love those hush puppies. - Still pretty good. - Mm-hmm. But don't you worry, the good Lord will be with your mama all night. Promise you that. No. Ain't no way you're waking up. Room 218 needs cleaning. I already cleaned it. He pissed the bed. He urinated a moment ago. That's why I cleaned it. Dorothy, clean the sheets. - What is that about? - State Pen. Tried to kill himself. He'll make it, though. Poor thing. They gotta leave him handcuffed to the bed even though he's passed out? He murdered someone. Don't you read the paper? She only reads the Bible. And those Good News bulletins that folks leave on your front porch when you don't answer the door. Okay. Emergency dialysis. 67-year-old male. Three times in a month. That's you. Mr. Collins? Yep, but not critical, so just prioritize. I don't like this room. You hear me? I said I don't like it. You can leave when you're done with your dialysis. Sad sweat. That's what it smells like. You ever smelled sadness? Only every day. You know, they only gave me three months. Two and a half now, maybe. I'm here half the damn time. I do wanna go home, though. You turn on that TV? Sure. My husband likes a clean car, what can I say? Well, you know what they say about Arkansas, if you don't like the weather, just wait a minute. My grandma did always say that. Mine too. Well, thanks for the weather update, Wendy. Let's get back to the real news of this evening. The local Eighth Grade Science Fair. Now, these kids show some real aptitude. You know... ...sad thing about dying is that the minutes really slow down. You forgot to appreciate all those other minutes and all you got are these shitty ones. Hey, Mandy, they're bringing in an OD, and I'm too busy. They could use some extra hands. Shit. Hey, male, 30s. OD'd, no identification. Found at a motel. Heart rate is 38. Respiratory rate, critical. Administered Narcan. What? - Nothing. - You know him? Uh. Sort of. Okay. He needs his whole system flushed. Okay. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. Oh, shit, he's having a seizure. Code blue, someone get a line set up. Oxygen's going down, code blue. You're late. But there's nothing I like better than cash in my hand. There's a few things I like a lot more than cash in my hand. Me too, actually. Or maybe not. 202 is too tricky. I have another idea. Mr. Collins. Dialysis. Just gotta keep prying eyes away. Well, look at you taking initiative. I like my initiative too. Well, I guess I could have your crazy ass cousin do another pickup tomorrow. That girl is not my cousin. You better tell her that. Regina, where the fuck have you been? Geez, Nick, I told you I was running late. I reckoned you guys would be in here playing poker - or whatever you do. - Nah, I already won. Yeah, that shit ended hours ago. You... - kept me waiting. - Geez, sorry. I came right here. - Our cousin said... - Our cousin? No, no, you're my cousin. She's your cousin. And she's your cousin by marriage. Mm-hmm. And that makes her your cousin too. Regina, that's not how family works. What's happening to her? She's getting her belly button pierced. Stop moving, it'll hurt less. Uh. Mikey, get her a drink, okay? It don't look like she likes it much. And how is that any of your fucking business? Mandy said one of those things is a kidney. "One of those things"? You don't recognize a kidney? Telling you, public school here is a lot of... - What the fuck is this? - Oh. I use those to keep it a little bit cooler. You know, I always say, "Part of my job is to keep things cool." That's sweet, but where are my fucking organs? Uh. Under the drinks. No, no, there's nothing here. - Is this a fucking joke? - No, no joke. Uh. I... I don't know. Let me check my car. Regina, I... I realize you're new here. You've been with us, what, a couple of weeks? - A month. - Okay. But your sole purpose is to bring me the fucking organs. I'm sure I left them in my car. I need the fucking organs right fucking now! I've got a guy who needs an organ tonight. An important guy, more important than... than my cousin. You had one job to do and that was to bring me the kidney from the hospital. It's really... it's really very simple. I know. This is an emergency, Regina. Shut up! - I... I'll check my car. - You do that. And if it ain't out there, I can think of another place where we can find ourselves a kidney. Maybe that's what you're good for. - Parts. - I... I'll check my car. - Somebody get this. - Somebody come get this. Shit. Shit. It's at the hospital. I'll be right back. It takes 30 minutes to get there. She's not back in an hour, drag her back by the hair. Can do. Hey, will you turn it up? I wanna know if it's gonna rain. You deaf? You know, it's Karen's birthday next week. You gonna pitch in for flowers? We're all chipping in three bucks. - Probably not. - Everybody's doing it. When are you done with your probation? Bite me. Hey, EMT Derrick said you knew that trash OD downstairs. Who is he? Bitch. Hoppity the Bunny is what his name is, and that Beanie Baby sold for over 500 dollars right here in town. Wow, better stock up on those. Our top story this evening is the police force Y2K Preparation Convention. Looks like our whole force is out there. That and then some. Tonight began the first night of a three... Don't tell the next shift yet. Maybe not Mr. Collins. I like him. I wanna think of someone else. - What about that prisoner? - He has a guard. I ain't scared of that. Well, he is gonna get the chair. I guess that could work. - It your birthday next week? - Yeah. They getting me some flowers or some shit? - Yeah. - That's depressing. Okay. - Ma'am. - Just checking in. - You here all night? - Uh. Unfortunately so, ma'am. How's he doing? - You're the expert. - Hmm. Do you need anything? - I could use a coffee. - You know, I'm not allowed to do that for you. But I could watch him for a while if you wanna go grab one. Go on. They don't... they don't want me to leave his side. Oh, he is not going anywhere. Yeah. Thanks, but, rules are rules. Get me some goddamn drugs. I'll see if I can get you that coffee. How you feeling today? - Did you find that coffee? - Nope. We made a mistake. What the fuck are you doing here? - Whoa, is that Andrew? - What mistake? He OD? What's it about this family that makes you guys all into junkies, huh? Must be your daddy or something. Is Andrew gonna die? - I never liked... - There is a reason we meet down by the soda machine, Regina. You can't be seen here. I didn't want to come in here, okay? You know, surrounded by all these dying people. This is how you get one of those flesh-eating bacteria diseases like they got on TV. - What are you talking about? - Oh, you think it's an itch? And... and then you scratch it... and your whole face comes right off. And it always begins in a hospital. - Why are you here? - We fucked up. - Shit. - Told you that it wasn't here. Well, where the hell is it? I don't know. I don't know, I... I don't know. I... I... Maybe you lost it on the way there. I didn't touch the cooler between here and the warehouse. I checked my car. I checked everywhere. Look, if it's not here, there is nothing I can do. - We are laying low. - Look... I'm a little bit desperate here. Nicholas is gonna have my ass if I don't bring him a kidney. Maybe more than my ass. He... he is gonna take my kidney. He said so. How many... how many do I need to live? - One. - How many was I born with? - Two. - That's not too bad. Look... Mm-mm. I don't wanna point fingers at you. It's your job to make sure I get the package securely. And apparently, I didn't. Just help me out. Regina. Why, just explain it to me. - How do you murder people? - I don't murder them. It's killing someone. That's murder, whatever you do to them. I don't know what you do, but how... how do you do it? - Mandy, just tell me. Come on. - Bleach. - I use bleach. - Hmm. And then you wait? Someone else does the removals on the next shift. I don't even know who. Maybe you know how to do it right. You went to school, you know... you know what thing sits where, - whatever it sits in there. - Yes, I know how to do it. So you could do it all, you could do it real fast. - Like, all in one night. - No. It's too hard. - Uh-huh. - Mandy, help me, please? I'm fucked. Regina, you lost thousands of dollars worth of organs. - What about Andrew? - What about Andrew? I mean, is he gonna make it outta here alive? - Yeah. - Really? He didn't look too good. You never really liked him, right? I... I know he's family too, but... not like you and me. I never did like him when it all came out that he did that... that awful stuff to you when you was kids... Shut it. Don't you dare go in that room. Get the fuck out of here. Do you understand me? You are gonna have to solve this problem by yourself. Yes. Mandy? Is it 'cause I said all that stuff, about Andrew... about your fucked up childhood? Well, look at you. Mm-hmm. How dead are you? This is Wendy with the weather. That big storm looks like it's coming in tonight. Straight from the north and hitting us right here in Northeast Arkansas, and it is gonna be a wet one. Tune in here for flash flood warnings. Remember the basics. - Close the windows to your car? - Why? It's gonna rain. I don't leave the windows to my car open. Then they're closed. High humidity of 87 today. Get that package out all right? Yep. And the other? I'll keep you updated. Next week, we got another hot one for you. - This is a nasty ass cake. - Yeah. They always get... gross cake. Stay tuned next for American Life. Oh. Thank you. Guess I fell asleep. It's easy to get tired on these night shifts. Mm. - You, uh, work for the prison? - Nah, I'm just hired security. They don't even give me a gun. I mean, not that... not that I need one. I do parties. And nightclubs too. And sometimes, I do the... do the show circuit, the stadium shows. I just did a Marilyn Manson... show. Do you like them? - Mm. No. - No, yeah. Just a bunch of... long-haired vampire-looking kids, but it was... it was cool. Yeah, that guitarist used to be on The Wonder Years. Yeah, he got one of his ribs taken out so he could suck his own dick. Yeah. Uh... Hey. - Hi! - You here for his blood work? Uh-huh, yep, mm-hmm. He's probably gonna be a vegetable. It's a waste, he's pretty cute. Maybe he's an asshole in real life. Cute ones always are. Excuse me. Could you direct me to room 222? I keep getting lost. I'm busy. - It's just around the corner. - Well, I can't seem to find it. Then I guess... I'll show you. You will. Just keep going. It's on this floor. - You are not very helpful. - I'm busy, can't you see that? Well, I need to know where I'm going... I'm like the other nurse. You know, I'm also busy. This is my patient. Mrs. Eliza Patrick. And Mrs. Patrick needs me. Who is your supervisor? I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk to you. Who is your supervisor? I want to tell them about your poor customer service. You're the one who can't find her way around one story of a building. I'm gonna tell everyone about that. Are you my nurse? - Yes, ma'am, I am. - I need to get up for a bit. Nah. I think that's a bad idea. Nurse! - Can I get a nurse in here? - Where are you going? To help this screaming man. - Nurse? - What is your name? Mandy. Well, I'm gonna report you, Mandy! I think I must be done. - Been here for over two hours. - Probably so, then. What's happening to you in here? What? Dialysis. - Are you a nurse or what? - Obviously. Look at my outfit. Could you turn that TV up? Can't hear anything. What happened? She tried to stand. I saw her from the hallway. I didn't think she'd wake up. - She's stronger than she looks. - Mrs. Patrick? Your daughter just stepped out. We need to get you back in the bed, okay? Where is she? Call her daughter, please, and tell her she's awake. Come on now. - That's right. - Up we go. Where is Shawna? Mrs. Patrick. Eliza. Listen to me, okay? We're here to take care of you. - Stay here a minute, will you? - Okay. Shit. What the fuck? - It's bleach. - Oh, my sweet Jesus. Did you say bleach? - Mr. Collins? - He's gone. Oh, no! Oh! What the fuck happened to him? - I don't know. - Have you lost your damn mind? I can't cover something like this. - No. Dammit. It wasn't me. - You sure? Yes. - Somebody call the cops? - Yep. Damn! - You going home? - They told me to wait and give a statement. - We are fucked. - I know, Karen. This is gonna set us way back. We can't do anything for weeks now. Do you think I don't fucking know that, Karen? Damn. Well, if you didn't do it, who did? You know, he was really depressed. Ain't nobody drinking bleach, Mandy. Then I don't know. Is there any more cake? - What? - Oh, my God. Wha... Oh, good. Oh, goddammit. What the fuck are you doing here? Why are you wearing that? This is not funny, Regina. You need to get the fuck outta here. We just had an a... What did you do? - Uh... Well, I was... - What the hell did you do? Nothing, I was just helping you out. Did you pour bleach down that man's throat? Yeah. I just did what you do. - That is not what I do. - Hmm? Why, I need that man's kidney. I need it tonight. Just give it to me and I'll leave. I'll go, you won't ever see me again. Oh, my God. You're so stupid. You are such a stupid bitch. Excuse me? - Fuck you. - You are so dumb. Do you know what dialysis is? Mr. Collins was on dialysis because his kidneys are so shitty he can't flush out his own system. So even if I was stupid enough to help you, that man's kidneys are useless. You killed an innocent man for no reason. Do you understand that? I'm not leaving till you give me a kidney. You are gonna leave. And you are gonna leave right now. The cops are coming here. And when they get here, I'm gonna tell them who did this shit, the girl posing as a nurse standing in the storage room like an idiot. You wouldn't turn on me like that. You brought me into this whole thing. Oh, like hell I wouldn't. Then I'll tell them everything. All the bad stuff about you... about your little operation. Hell, about all the drugs you do in here. If I leave here without a kidney... I'm dead. What happened to this guy? Alcohol and morphine. - Is he dead? - No. Whoa. Is this, like, a prisoner or something? Mm, he's perfect. Just bleach him and take his kidney. Probably deserves it. What did he do? Haven't you heard? Murder. I murdered a cop. I hate cops... but I love blondes. - We didn't know you were awake. - Come on. Take one of my kidneys, and I'll take one of yours. Fuck. Hey, you ever do it on someone who's awake? I... I mean, he could still work. No, stop trying to help. Give me an hour, wait outside. Okay, fine, but we have to hurry. An hour. Lucky you got family checks on you. I could've used this tonight. Hope you enjoy it. Mandy, you're next. He needs a statement. - I was just, uh... - Mandy, wait right there. It'll just be a minute. Ma'am, would you mind closing the door? Okay. Sit. Hour's up. Fuck you. Mikey. Shit. Shit. Shit, shit, shit. No one else in the unit at the time that you know of? - No. - No, sir. Nothing strange to report when you saw Mr. Collins last? - Nope. - No, sir. Although he was always a bit surly. We'll notify the family. His poor family. They were never around. Well, it doesn't make it right. No, ma'am, it does not. Have a good night, officer. Uh, No, I'm staying here till morning, just to make sure you ladies are safe. Just gotta take care of you ladies. I wanna keep an eye on things. Make sure that no bad guys get in. Yeah, we got another officer coming by to ask y'all some questions later. He's like a detective, you know? I'm just sorta night shift. You know, I... I think y'all got nothing to worry about. It was just an out-of-the-ordinary - type situation. - Well, you can say that again. It was just an out-of-the-ordinary type situation. Oh. I get it. But I'll be here, all night. You two will be safe. - Are we done here? - Yes, ma'am. That's all my questions. I got a lot of patients to get to. Karen, Karen, Karen, Karen. Are you sure you don't have a room for me? - Mr. Kent. - Hmm? We have to get to the priority problems first. I mean, look at you. You're walking around, you're standing up. I... I don't know even know - what's wrong with you. - I'm dizzy. You don't need a room. - Hey. - Hey. - You get interviewed? - By that cute cop? - Yeah. - He funny, ain't he? I like 'em funny, and rich. But he ain't rich. Mr. Kent. Go sit down and wait your turn. You are nosy as hell. It's too stuffy in here, so. Someone expired in the ICU. The coroner just left. And the body is in the morgue waiting to be transferred. But I thought we agreed. Extenuating circumstances. I'll explain later. Well, damn, bitch, you could've warned me. You know, I got a bad heart, I can't take this shit. Trust me. Trust you about as far as I can throw you. Mr. Kent. Mr. Kent? We have a room for you. Where the hell did he go? Shit. Shit. Shit. Hey. Isn't it a little late for you to be out here skating? Amen. ♪ Have you been to Jesus ♪ For his cleansing power ♪ ♪ Are you washed in The blood of the lamb ♪ ♪ Are you fully trusting In his grace this hour ♪ ♪ Are you washed in The blood of the lamb ♪ ♪ Are you washed in the blood ♪ In the soul-cleansing Blood of the lamb ♪ ♪ Are your garments spotless ♪ Are they white as snow ♪ ♪ Are you washed in The blood of the lamb ♪ ♪ Have you been to Jesus For the cleansing power ♪ ♪ Are you washed in The blood of the lamb ♪ Freeze, motherfucker! Oh. Sorry. Heard a noise. - Uh. It was me. - Yeah. What happened? Man, y'all sure do get dirty, huh? I could not do that. You want some help with this guy? Uh... Sure. Sorry, I'm trying to be a gentleman and all. One, two. You guys probably get a lot of back issues, huh? Some people do. You look like you work in a... butcher shop. Hey, you want a soda? I just got an extra one from the machine. I'm good. No offense, uh, this room is real creepy. - And smells, so. - Uh. Yeah. Totally. Wow. Oh, sorry. Probably not allowed to touch that, huh? - Yeah. Better not. - I mean, oh, okay. Just trying to be, make a joke, you know? It's pretty disgusting. Not that I'm not used to seeing... disgusting things. I mean, I... I really am. You'd be surprised what happens. This one guy, he, um, yeah, I mean, he, uh... Guess I don't really have any stories. You know, just stuff happens, you know? Yeah. It's kinda like, you know, like Cops, - if you've ever seen that show. - You know... - I think I will take that soda. - All right. I'm so glad you're here, to take care of us... to make sure we're safe. Just doing my job. I'll let you get back to yours. Mm-hmm. Bye. Shit. - No, no, no, no, no. - Dorothy? Mandy? I gotta go get that cute cop 'cause I swear to God, there's a dead body over there! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. There's another one. - A dead body, can you hear me? - Where? - Huh? - Where? Over by the storage shed! I don't know what I was... I just went out there, just looking for somewhere outta the rain to smoke. Oh, God, I shouldn't even be smoking! And then... and then there was a dead body! Do you know what that means? Mandy! There is a murderer loose in the hospital. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, we're gonna die. - We're gonna die. Oh, God. - Oh, God. - So, are you a doctor? - No, I'm a nurse. Now go sit down. I'll be with you in a minute. - We have a problem. - Yeah, no kidding. Y'all found someone to help me yet? Nope. Just let me know when you do. Y'all... y'all stay safe. - Okay. - What the hell? I guess we have multiple problems. I need your help. Mandy, what did you get into? I'm just gonna apologize in advance. Wait, so this bitch might be wearing scrubs? She might be snorting up all the Valium in the building, for all I know. She's fucking nuts. I don't like it when people call women nuts. It's just an excuse to belittle their problems. And mental health is nothing to belittle. This bitch is actually nuts. Say what you want, doesn't mean I like it. - Excuse me, ladies? - Not now, all right? Fine. So, what's your plan here? Find this crazy bitch and get her the fuck outta here before she tells on both of us. You're sure this was her? Yeah, I'm sure. Why would you bring this cousin of yours into this if you knew she would kill people and rat us both out? I sometimes have too much faith in humanity. That is what I like about you. But just so you know, if either of you get me in trouble, I will ask God to strike you both down, 'cause he listens to me. Shit. Come on. - Ah, shit. - We're going on a walk. All right. Hey, Dr. Wilder. Y'all look mad. Damn, bitch, where's your shoes? That guy pooped on them when he died. Oh, Lord, you're right, she is a murderer. Y'all are murderers first. - Look, I... I can explain. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - Are those your panties? - Yeah. It's all I had to put the kidney in. And I didn't hear from you and... and it had been over an hour... I was caught up in the mess you created. Well, I was all alone... and then Mikey came and there was a cop waiting around... - Did they see you? - No, never, I was just hiding. And then that kid came, so I went over there - and I just... I... - ...got it. Stop. You need to get the fuck outta here. Those cops are gonna be looking for you or anybody that did this shit. And there's some creep outside waiting to rip your tits off. Well, it's fine now 'cause I have a kidney. Now I can see Mikey. He won't rip my tits off. - That ain't no kidney. - What isn't? That is not a kidney. That's a bladder. - Oh, Lord Jesus. - But how do you know that? I don't know if my heart can take this right now. I saw where you opened that kid up. You didn't even go in the back. No, my... my... my kidneys are right here. Those are your ovaries. That is a bladder. Damn, you're nuts! Maybe you should think about this shit before you go murdering someone. I hate you. Shit. They're coming for me. It's just the storm. Ladies and gentlemen, I have to inform you that we are in a lock down situation. Oh, that is not necessary. Do not exit or enter the building. Shit, I gotta get the fuck outta here. I just, I'm gonna go run. - I'm just gonna run outta here. - Stop. I got you a kidney, like I said I would. It's down by the soda machine. Go down there, get it, and get the fuck outta here. But there's cops outside. Karen will walk you out. - Mm-mm. - And I'll distract the cops. I... I'm not going anywhere with that murderer, no. I'm pulling rank. All right, all right, all right, fine. I will walk you out. Will you kindly... distract the cops? Just get them to the waiting room and we'll sneak out the back. Fuck, can't believe I'm taking pity on your redneck ass. Okay, give me ten minutes... and if I catch... your skinny ass, impersonating a nurse again, I will rip your bladder out. - Okay. Thank you. - She said, "Thank you." - Ten minutes. - Yeah, ten minutes. We're just gonna wait here for a minute. Hospital, code red. Shelter in place. Um... Let's go to the nurse's station. We're gonna go to the nurse's station. Why do we have to go to the nurse's station? - We just have to. - Why? People are there. Throw that away. Hospital, code red. - You look sweaty. - Shut up, let's go. Wait. - I just wanna go home. - It's late and I can't get a hold of anyone. Well, then I'm going on a break. We don't have time for you to take a break, Dorothy. Mandy, I need you out front. Someone needs to be out there to keep the public from getting in. It's like no one understands what lockdown means. I was just, um... I was just going out - for a smoke break. - Is that a joke? And you, little missy, need to get back to your own floor. - Yes, ma'am. - Uh-huh. - I'll take her. - Why would you need to do that? Dammit, Mandy. There is too much going on. Just go before I write you up. It's just been a long night. For everyone. It's been a long night for everyone. Go. Hospital, code red. Shelter in place. Double go. - Hey, you can't be back here. - Help. Help, really scary guy... ...in the waiting room. Probably the murderer that you're looking for. Huge, very huge, hulking. - Okay, you stay here... - Nope, no, no, no. Definitely both of you 'cause... ...he's huge. So can you just, like... Yes, waiting room. Oh, it's you. Finally, I... I was calling about my mother. What can I do for you? Oh, hi, we're on lock down. You can't be on this floor. Uh. Excuse me, who are you? Hello? Excuse me! We are on lockdown! Did... did you speak to my daughter? - What? - You said you were gonna - get her back up here. - That... that was someone else. My daughter needs to know that I'm sick. That's the reason I'm in this fancy hotel. Uh. Wha... wha... what kind of sick? I feel nauseated. Can I get a warm towel? - I'll get a nurse. - You look like a nurse. Who are you? You are not supposed to be in here. - I'm a new nurse. - In what unit? - Uh. Today's my first day. - Where do you work? Third floor. I just came down here 'cause, uh, I know this... this woman. Does she know you? She's sick. Obviously. Doesn't remember a damn thing, but we are such good... - friends from church. - I do go to church. Well, what... is her name? Uh. Patrick. Uh. Mrs. Patrick. That's my married name. Okay. Fine. Sorry, Mrs. Patrick. I didn't realize that you were such good friends. You know we're on a lockdown? You're not supposed to leave your floor. Really? There was a dead body. I found it. I was smoking, please don't tell. You need to go back upstairs. Did they not announce it up on third? - No, no, no. - Yes, they did. You gotta get back up there. Where are your shoes? Uh... - Help me! - No, no. No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no. I threw up. Can you get that warm towel for me? You better not have given me a disease. Dammit. Goddammit. You're strong. Dammit! Dammit! Ma'am, are you okay? Help me! Help us! Hey, girl. Are you new? Where do you think you're going? Just heading back to the third floor. No, ma'am. No elevators 'cause of lock down. - You gotta take the stairs. - Mm. Okay. And make sure that someone from your floor comes down to assist the cops. - Sure. - We can't do everything. Yep, thanks. Could you tell if he was armed? I don't know, don't murderers always have weapons? Well, I... I mean, he was... he was here just a minute ago. Uh. And like I said, he was really, really... He was really horrible-looking. - Maybe he left. - Or... or maybe he went back into the hospital and murder more people. Murder people? What is going on? Are we in danger here? No, ma'am, everything is fine. Just remain calm. Well, I need to know what's going on. - I'm going. Good luck. - Okay, good luck to you. Well, hello. Wow. You look fucking gross, Regina. You know, I've been... I've been looking for you, skanky. Good. I was looking for you too. Hmm, you know, I'm supposed to drag you back to Nicholas by your hair. That's a little extreme, don't you think? Now, I've got legs. I can just walk. Don't you want a damn kidney? Oh, it's a little late for that. Look... it's not my fault. My stupid cousin... she lost it, but... but she got me another one. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hmm. No. No, do not try all that sexy shit with me, Regina. You are covered in blood and puke. Not impressed. - Told you. - That's a great cooler. - Can you open it up? - A lot of work went into this. You wouldn't believe the trouble we went to to get you this. Now, what the fuck? What the fuck indeed, Regina. Come here. - Oh, wait. - Come here! Thanks for these. Maybe the nicest thing you ever did for me. Mandy? This is the suspicious woman, ma'am? I don't think so. It is Mandy, isn't it? - Yeah. - This isn't her. Mandy? What are you doing with my patient? - Excuse me. - Uh... Goddammit! Again? All right, now go over with me again where you were around 2:00 a.m. - You saw me. - In the morgue. What were you doing in the morgue? You have no business being in there. I was checking a deceased patient's records. Officer Myers, this woman is on probation. That is an internal probation and he doesn't need to know about it. It's relevant and now it's extended. If you were checking records in the morgue, why were you covered in blood? Oh, that's what happens in a morgue. - But you changed? - That's what we do. Don't wanna walk around covered in blood. That's right. Come on, Janet, you know me. What were you doing with those vials? Checking them, seeing what you had him on. - And why would you do that? - Hey. That's enough. I think we're gonna have to go down to the station and talk this thing out. - Oh! - Unless, you can explain to me what's going on. That's my brother. That's my brother in that room in a coma. The drug addict. I was worried about him. She's lying. She has never mentioned a brother, not once. I'm not lying, Jesus. I'm... His name is Andrew McCandry. My half-brother. He has OD'd three times in the past two years. And this time... may be his last, according to what I just read on that chart. Did you check his files? - Yeah. - That's right, isn't it? Yeah. That's right. I'm sorry, I really do trust you. I just wanted to make sure he was getting the best care. I care about him and... So much I care about him. Fuck, I believe you. Thank you, Officer Myers. But you still gotta come down to the station with me. I got a lot of questions for you, Mandy. I just answered all your questions. Stephen. Ma'am. Uh. We got an issue. A new one. Oh. Mandy, come with me. I can still get you a kidney. I know how. You are so fucking stupid, do you know that? Every teacher I ever had told me that already, so shut up! These nurses... they just go for someone on the verge of death so no one notices. Me and you can take one of these dying fuckers and just drag him on outta here. Use a whole damn body if you want. It'll be fresh as hell. You'll probably make Nicholas real happy. Well, you don't just get a kidney. You get all the organs inside. I know the exact dying asshole you can use. Just having a lover's quarrel. I've been there. It's raining, huh? Yeah, it's really pissing out there tonight. - I know you. Don't I? - Regina. Didn't you say had someone you needed to see inside? - Mm-hmm. - Let's leave the man alone. Good seeing you again, blondie. Call it in. - Where's his pants? - Charmaine, we've got a 10-74 at the hospital. Looks pretty dead to me. Hey, hey, you're not permitted to leave. Hey, Mandy! Mandy, hey! Go downstairs, wait for backup. Hey, hey. What the hell's wrong with you? Mandy! - Someone get in here! - Co... come on! - Whoa. - What the fuck? Please, dear, don't curse. She's alive, someone get a stretcher. A... all right, everybody just calm down. - I didn't do it. - What the fuck is happening? - What did you do, Mandy? - I was with you. Hey, hey, stay calm. - I'll go get help. - No, no, you stay here and I... I... I'll call it in. We need to get that woman off the ground and help her now. She is bleeding, badly. Shit! Fuck! Mandy! You are not permitted to go anywhere. I took an oath to help people, Officer Myers. I'm not just gonna leave Dorothy on the floor dying. And I'm telling you not to fucking move. I'll come clean with you. There may be someone in the hospital doing all of this and I know who it is. Shit. I fucking hate cops. But we already went over this. Get the fuck off of him. I couldn't find any bleach! Oh, man! Ooh! What the fuck? What the fuck? Fucking bitch! Both of you get the fuck outta here. I gotta get some organs. There is a kidney in the cooler. It's gone! - You are lying. - That's the truth. Are you telling me you lost two kidneys in one night? - She said you lost them. - She did. I'm the one who got them for her. - How could I lose 'em? - This is too much talking. We taking this guy with us or what? No, you are not. You are gonna go back to Nicholas and you are gonna tell him this shit is off. He can go to hell and so can you. Come on, what the fuck did Andrew ever do for you except give you an addiction, huh? What the fuck is happening? Get off of her! Fuck. Freeze! No! You freeze. Fuck! Fuck. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. - I don't wanna shoot you! - You already fucking shot me! I don't wanna shoot you again! You fucking asshole. I have hostages. Just back away from the door and let me through. Don't hurt 'em. Patch me up, now! - Okay. Okay. - Come on. - I'm coming. - Fuck. Don't try anything weird. The bullet is in there. You need to get it out. Yeah, I know that. You think this is the first time I've been shot? I'm coming in! I swear to God, I will shoot both these bitches! We're gonna go out the backdoor and you're gonna let us! No, you're not! I will shoot them if they try anything! And we're taking this fucker with us. - Get him in the wheelchair. - No fucking way. Regina said we can have all his organs, let's go! You are not taking my brother. Save him or save yourself. It's your choice. We are taking him regardless. Mandy, what's going on in there? Okay. I'll do it. Get that gun out of my face. Regina, get the wheelchair. Let's go. Go, go, go, go. Damn, get the thing out of his face. Come on, hang on. Dammit. Goddammit. All right. Uh. We're gonna head downstairs and when we get outside, - I'm taking him with me. - Stay where you are! Jesus Christ, shut up! - Shit! - What's happening? Don't these people need, like, machines to breathe and shit? I swear to God, what did you do, lady? It is just the lights. Backup generator takes care of all the vital stuff. Now... ...we are going to go down the hall, carry him down the stairs, and you can go out the backdoor, okay? All right, but I'm taking Regina with me. - Regina is staying here. - No, she does not. That is the deal. You get Andrew, I get Regina. You know, I don't have time for this shit. Fine, fuck it, whatever. You push him. Go! Wait, I wanna give him a sedative. Why? So he doesn't wake up in the middle of you operating on him. Fuck. - Fuck! - You got this? Yeah. Yeah. Nurse, hurry up! Jesus Christ, what the fuck is going on? - I'm nervous. - Junkie. Oh, my fucking eye! - Go. - Bitches! Why take Andrew? Leave him. I don't want him taken away for organs. Why the fuck are you so nice to someone who just treated you like shit? - You treat me like shit. - We gotta go. - Hold on! - Get up! - He's got my knife. - Crazy cunts. I'm going out the front. I can't do that, they got cops outside. Mandy? Mandy? Did you hear that noise, what the fuck is going on? Janet, run! Goddammit. Sorry, ma'am. Go in that room and lock the door. Go! Shit. Someone turned out my nightlight. What is happening here? Do you know why the lights went out? And is this blood on the floor? Y'all just need to stay cool. Shit. You assholes took my eye! Janet, Janet. Come on, come on. That's right, put your head up. What's going on? Okay, lift up for one second, one second. Okay. No! That's my friend! From church! Dammit. Get the fuck outta here! He's in there. Run. - Get the fuck over here! - No! You think you can just run away and I wouldn't catch you? Well, now I'm taking both of y'all, you and the fucking wheelchair boy. There's gotta be something useful inside each of you, unless yours is blackened from painkillers! Mikey, don't hurt her. Okay, y'all go! Go, this ain't gonna last long. Run! Oh, shit. Oh, come on. What the fuck, ladies? I know you're out here somewhere. Come on, bitches, it's cold out here! Where you at? Woo. You out in that rain? Ooh, you better be running in that rain! You better be singing in that rain! Enjoying it! But I know you're not... not with all them cops out there... 'cause I may do some... illegal shit... but it ain't nothing compared to you two lunatics. But I got plans for y'all. Mm. Spurt. Better come on out... 'cause both y'all have an appointment... to have all your little organs taken outta your skinny little bodies! - He's dead. - No. Are you a good witch or bad witch? There cops out there? Yeah, and we'll scream if you try anything. - No, you won't. - Are you here to kill us? No. But I need your help getting outta here. Mandy, do something, help me. No, you're a fucking psychopath. This is all your fault. - It's yours. - Just take her. Thank you kindly, ma'am. She sure is a pretty one. Blonde hair and blue eyes. I wasn't gonna hurt her. I was just gonna use her to get outta here. You better hurry up. - You girls are crazy. - Go home, Regina. Get the fuck outta here. Is this gonna give me a disease? No, just go home. You can't wear that. Take it off. Am I... am I fired? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I... I won't tell no one. I know you won't. See you around, then, cuz. Yeah. See ya. More on that in the next hour. Our top story this morning concerns the three deaths reported at the local hospital over night, with two additional people in critical condition. What's now being considered a combination of a suicide, a potential homicide, and a freak accident is currently under investigation. The police are on the scene now, but due to the Y2K preparation weekend, much of the police force wasn't in the area when the events began to unfold. But the official statement from the chief is that the delays in police arrival did not contribute to additional... ...deaths and injuries. It's been a tragic year. We extend our condolences to the families of those injured or killed in the hospital last night. The investigation is still open, but we've been informed that the area is secure. We'll be hearing more from the police later today. I told Officer Myers all that. And he said I was free to leave. I was real sad about Mr. Collins. He just couldn't handle being here anymore. No one deserves to go that way, but I... I think it was suicide. Uh, uh. Sir, you are not listening to me. He was a madman. He... he clearly killed all these people. I mean, what kind of hospital is this? Ma'am, uh, can I get you a drink of water? - Yes, you can! - You wanna come with me? She's right. He was crazy. We may have some more questions for you, but I think I've got all your information, so you should be okay. - Is everybody dead? - No. Janet may not be able to talk for a while, but that cute cop ain't doing so good. - Cute ones always die. - You mind helping? My shift just ended. - Seriously? - Yeah. Don't you dare touch her. I don't want anyone in this hospital near her! Are you going home? No, they want me to stay until things get settled. That's a long shift for you. Yeah, well, I'm getting overtime. - Uh... I'll see you later. - Yeah, see ya. How you doing? That was very strange. Why is this so small? And this so big? Who's gonna do something with these bags that I found? Who's gonna help me with this? Someone gonna do something with these bags that I found? I found this one, looks like they're chock-full of organ meat. I found this at the soda machine. I went down for a nice drink and then I went down again later, 'cause no one's seen me for a while, and then I found this one. It looks like someone was keeping them there. Oh, oh, now you're gonna pay attention. - Got the organs in my hands. - Whoa, whoa. Okay, thank you. This has about seven or eight different ones inside. Yeah, and I had... I kept the soda far away, it's fine. I'm a little dizzy. You need to be very careful with your hands.
