-[metallic flickering] -[inspirational music] [mysterious plucky music] Once upon a time, my brother said to me, meet us at the sign where the railway goes to the sea, then stairs go down and down to the shore. My oldest brother lies dead, drunk in an open field. That was his idea of a perfect crime. He was 13 at the time, I was seven. The other brother stands with his back to the sea waving at a distance, Lakes Maclean, age 13, genius. Three shillings [indistinct] Look, I'll give you a bargain. -Five shillings. -No. -For you, eight. -Thieving [indistinct] Look, final offer, seven shillings. -Your mum's in China. -Five shillings. -Well, I've only got two. -Thought you said -you had three. -I lied. Okay, now can we get out of here? -Money. -Hairy palms! -What does that mean? -Madness in the family. -There ya are. -Come on. It's for you, Alan [indistinct] -Actually, it cost a fortune. -Where did you get a fortune? Saved it up for your birthday. [laughter] -Hello, Lorna. -Lex, I'm your mother. Go eat in the warehouse, so what's this? -Don't know. -El Greco. El what-o, you haven't gave a name yet. -This? -Monet. -Uh-huh and this? -Pierro Dello Francesco. -Della Francesca. -Alan. That's Bobby on a good night. -[laughter] -[mysterious music] -[shouting] Ma! -[toilet flushing] It's a way to bury him at sea, hey Lex? Look, it was an old fish, all right. -It's had it's day. -He was exactly two -and a half inches long. -[water running] There's a whole tub of food in there! -Bobby. -[clothes tearing] [shouting] You should tell him! [moaning] [screams] Shh quiet Bobby, you're all right now. -Shh, shh. -I was dead! -I was dead, ma! -[crying] -[shushing] -[whip cracks] -Up, again! -No, that's enough. -Put your hands up. -No! Report to the headmaster, Maclean. -Hey, Lex, come here. -I can't. Come on. Oh hiya, Lex, Alan was telling me you're a good bit artist yourself. [upbeat music] No arms, I wonder how he eats his breakfast. -Shut up, Lex. -Tits! -Lex! -It's down here on the right. -Up here, come on. -[laughter] Are you boys students? -What's that smell? -Oil paint. -Can you see the life model? -Nah. -She's just out of sight. -I've never seen a naked woman before, have you? Look, we just barge in like we're lost, get a good look at Nancy Barsotti. -Brilliant plan, Alan. -It'll be a good laugh. -Come on. -All right. Can I help you, son? [fun fair music] [indistinct chatter and laughter] So just then, a big cloud comes across the sky. I swear, it looked like one of those china ducks. Except, with a cigar stuck up its arse. I started to laugh, the girl says, -what's with you? -Aye? Aye, she's quiet for a bit then she goes, Christ! And then she screams, what, I says. She says, look at the face on that. That looks just like Charlie Sloane. -Bobby, kill him. -Glen! -Glen, you bastard! -[shouting] [elephant trumpets] [indistinct chatter and laughter] -[bell rings] -[knocking] -Lex, hi. -Hello, Uncle Andrew. [poorly played trumpet] [cheering and applause] [singing in foreign language] [cheering] Wonderful, Lorna, fantastic! -That was brilliant, Lorna! -You should -have gone professional. -Aye. -You missed the boat, hen. -It's never too late, Lorna. Nah, nah, Lorna, just time to talk shop with your boy here, remember me when you're a famous artist, son. -Van Gogh. -[laughter] -Andrew, give us a song. -Ah, no, no. Ah, come on, come on. -I couldn't follow that, no. -Oh come on. -Give us it. -Okay. [singing] So Lex, do you still have a graveyard for bumblebees? Hey, hey, you boys like art? -Let me show you this. -[laughter] -This is my ex wife. -[laughter] Put that away, Andrew, you'll upset Lorna. -What the heck, [indistinct] -[laughter] -[light breaking] -[people gasp] -Andrew! -Get him up, Lorna! Don't just stand there like a galoop, John. -My God, he's electrocuted. -Andrew, Andrew! I don't know why he's always doing this. -He's out cold. -[singing] Come on, get your coat, we're going to Jesse's. -You all right? -Yeah. -Don't stay up too late. -[indistinct chatter] Make sure he gets to bed and tell Bobby his supper's -waiting in the oven. -On you go. -Have a good time. -All right. -Get your coat on. -You boys get an early night. Look after your mother and remember, -you're Macleans. -[laughter] See, if I don't get into art school this year, -I can do tattoos. -[indistinct chatter] -You okay, Lex? -Yeah. -Give us some of that. -It's beer. -So? -Here. -Get a grip, Lex! -[Lex shouting] -Lex, for fuck's sakes! -[crashing] -Cut it out, Lex! -Let go! -Help me Alan, get me out. -What's going on? -[Lex screaming] -Bastard! -That's enough, get off him! -[crashing] [moaning] -Here. -Bobby? An offering, to keep the peace, okay? -Bobby? -[mysterious music] Look at this. -Did you clean it? -[men shouting in the distance] Lex, come here! Hey! -[man screams] -Shite. Lex! -You okay, pal? -[men screaming] -Jesus, Lex. -We got away, didn't we? Hey, ya bastards, you're dead! -You're dead! -Bastards. [men shouting] Lex? -Hello, Bobby. -A wee bird told me you shot Malkey Johnson in the eye. -Malkey Johnson, oh no! -Who's Malkey Johnson? Hard man, leads off the Garasade Tongs. -Psychopath. -In the eye. -Christ, I've blinded him. -Oh no. -Who's that? -That's nice, Alan! -Don't lose it at school. -Don't worry, mum. I'll have it framed, Lorna, something gold. Oh not before he applies to the art school. Frame might seen ostentatious. Frame makes the picture, yeah. A little bit of velvet trim would be nice, huh? Hey, can't you just push it in properly? -What? -What? -The paper, look at it. -Sorry. All right, Alan, that's okay. -You know my name? -Girls have a knack for these things, actually that I remember you from primary. -Joanne McGaven? -Yeah. You know, I'm free on Saturday night. Well, you could ask me out or something? -Ask you out, where? -I dunno, Vinci's cafe. How about it, how about maybe then? -Joanne, is that Alec? -No, gran. I'll put some tea on in a minute. 7:30 at the cafe, okay, I'll see you then, maybe. -Oh, what's this? -Hey. -That's it. -Let's see it, Jake. -Give it back. -Oh look, it's his mom. -It's his mommy. -Who done it? -Your dog? -Barry Whitty. -I mean, it's not bad. -Not bad? -And what do you know? -All right, Lex. -Hey you, Bobby's brother? -Aye. Come on up, bring the wee man, too. -Oops. -[fake laughs] By the way, remember, don't talk about football, -all right, he hates football. -[rock music playing] -Some collection of books. -Aye. We gotta show you this. Do you like it, inside pockets? I'm sure you'll have yours done. Hold, get the books in the bag! Take a seat, wee man. So, you Maclean brothers have been getting -quite the reputation. -What? Shot the leader of the Garasade Tongs smack in the nozzle. A deed unusual courage considering Malkey heads off a team -are going off 200 boys. -Maybe we can buy protection. Protection in numbers, son, the Glen Need lads ya feel as this position but you boys need us lads more than we need you, let's see. Nice touch, ever thought of being a war artist? The Carlton glorious conquests and all that shite? I don't know, if you don't get into art school, you could be the gang tourist. You've been looking at Egan Shield's paintings. Is that right, I got his book up there. You can borrow it if you like. -Thanks. -I'll buy this portrait -off you. -Why? -How does a quid sound? -A quid? I'm not sure, I need it for my art school application -and my mother quite likes it. -All right, all right. Half now and the rest when you give me the drawing later. Aye okay, I've never sold a drawing before. Done! And maybe you could do a wee bit of drawing for the Glen, in your official capacity, like. Something nice and easy to start with. Brilliant. Look, I'll get back to you once I foot this through. Only better not mention anything to your Bobby. It's a bit over his head, you know? -Don't get muddled. -You know, it's funny. Sloane's not like what I imagined. -I thought he was all right. -All right? Aye shit Alan, a real working class Medici but there's just one question. -Aye? -Where's your money? Where are we going? -Right, arms up. -What for, what for? Don't worry, my dad does this for a living. In ya go. -Shut up. -Just put ya legs in -and lower yourself down. -Down? -In ya go. -Oh no. -You're doing good, wee man. -No. -No! -[laughter] -What's going on down there? -It's an art gallery. You're Bobby Maclean, aren't ya? -Alan's brother. -Aye. I've seen you around too, I saw you at the skating with Charlie Sloane, another time down Need street with the Tongs and that head case Malkey Johnson. You come here on your own, then? Stood up, what's your excuse? Oh, I'm waiting for the boys and that. -This is it. -Oh yes, this is all right. Ready, Alan? You know about Andy from the Flip? They're not a bad team, Andy tripped Tommy Lamella. So Tom waited outside his house and Andy comes along with his burt. Well, it turns out the Bart's assistant one of Tom's team. -I didn't hear that. -And a point in fact, it wasn't Big Andy, it was Shug O'Riley that claimed Tom -and it wasn't stabbing. -Aye, it was. -I was there. -Sugar took a hammer to him and knocked out Tom's eye, I know because I was there. So Tom's cousin and his crew get Sugar's brother and drop him three floors down a stairwell at Val Dura Dance Hall and Shugy ask his cousin for a square goal, only it turn out the night [indistinct] I mean Christ, Bob, do you wanna talk -about this shite all night? -What do you mean? -Alan. -Oh, yeah. Charlie, keep your head down. Oh, shut up. Perfect, you're an artist, nobody'll ever know. -Charlie, say Glen. -[mysterious music] Have you seen Evan's new [indistinct] It's called 'Death to the American Paper Tiger'. -Paper tiger, huh? -Mhmm. The market is not that simple, Alan. Look, at the Younges going to Checkoslovakia ever the end, a nuclear war, the total annihilation of the planet. It's our fight, total annihilation of the planet? -Amazing, when? -[laughter] Maybe when you boys are older, you'll come to America. Your dad should have come when he could. He might've had a better life. -Dad was okay. -Aye, you didn't know your dad, Lex, you were too young. Strange to think that we were Scotts boys like you. Brothers, like you, you know, I've been around you boys for over two months, something doesn't feel so good right now, is everything okay? I'd like to feel if there was something on your mind, you could talk to me, well, I am your only uncle. -There may be something. -Uh-huh. -Mum can't know. -Oh sure. -It's just between us. -Not a word. -Promise? -Promise. -You see it's, it's Bobby. -There's a problem. -We think he might be a... -Really? -Really. -But please don't tell mum. Oh, no. -Well, Bobby. -[laughter] I guess, I guess there's a day Bobby they can, well, I guess it can be a little confusing, huh? Hey wee man, like the motor? -Aye. -Good 'cause you're in it. Shuggy, there's a gun in the back of this car. Would be a wee harm to be loaded, would it? Well, you know, these things are apt to go off at a moment's notice. Very dangerous, course it's loaded. As a matter of fact, we going for a cup of tea with Malkey Johnson, yeah. Look, look, Combey birds, Combey birds! -[screaming] Combey! -See? -What did I tell you? -[laughter] -Oh yeah, handcuffs. -[laughter] -You're a fucking headcase. -Oh come on now, Shug. -Let's not get sentimental. -[laughter] This is it, this is Tongland, out ya go son, take a walk. -Take a walk. -You can't do that, Charlie. I know because he'll cut off his ears and send them back -to his ma special delivery. -No. Maybe they'll render him unconscious with a hammer and drop him down the nearest manhole. -No. -How about... -They'll just kill him. -Well, what then? I just think it looks like it's going to rain. Aye, so it does, let it come down, huh Lexi? All right, let's go. Why didn't you turn up on our date? -Sorry, something came up. -It hurt me. You probably can't believe that. Keep sake. -Hello? -Jesus. -Jesus had no brothers. -That's great, Alan. -I didn't know you could draw. -Burick. -The complete version. -[bones clattering] Birthday present from Lex, the wee brother. Happy birthday, actually I collect wee brothers. All presents from the Garasade Tongs. This one's from the young Tongs. This ones from the tiny Tongs. This one's silver from the real Tongs and this one's pearstone from Malkey Johnson. -Malkey Johnson? -I know just about everybody, Alan, he's in love with me so he says. He leads one of the best young teams in the city and he still cries himself to sleep at night. He bangs his head off the wall. He seems like an animal, doesn't he scare you? Not the way you think, I've known Malkey since he was eight years old, he does anything I ask him. Anything but leave me alone. You're an unusual kind of boy, Alan. You don't know that, do you? -Fancy some tea? -No. No, me neither. -Can I help you, son? -No, it's not really me. Okay. Thought you weren't in the game? How, did you want my autograph? Nah but I know all about Bobby and Alan, do I. You know Bobby and Alan, so? Well, I'm ready to keep quiet about it -in return for certain favours. -Certain favours? You sound like Shakespeare, son. You're fuckin' Lex, aren't you? -Who's Lex? -Alan told me all about you. -Like what, what did he say? -Mostly good things. Maybe that you're a wee bit active up here and I met your wee pal Burick. So what kind of favours have you got in mind then, Lex? I'll need to think about that. Well, I bet Kennedy's for a start. [indistinct chatter] Bobby, Sloane wants you. Here, I need to chat. Shit! Shouldn't you be watching Dr. Kildare? -What? -Where's Alan? -I don't know. -You carrying? -No. -Aye, ya are. Give it to me and I'll take it in for you. They don't search the girls and we're friends. I'll see you inside. I'm 16. -Hey. -What? -Watch the suit. -[rock music playing] Charlie, you're not going to fit through there. We'll get them when their guard's down. It's [indistinct] all over again. Malkey's coming tonight, that means -full battalion strength. -Can I have my chip back, -please? -Sorry, Lex, confiscated. Go get some fresh air before Malkey gets here. What's all that, then? It's time ya learned the Glen then. Hmm 16. Can't we just break the window? No, Nate, the wee man will come on out the window any minute now. -Oh, no. -[birds chirping] -Shit. -Right boys, here we go. Jesus, Mary and Joseph, it's the Glen. Get out the way, we're coming in. Oh, dead scary, so yas are, look at my friend scared, too. She's trembling, come on Judie. Come and take a look at the Glen. -You'll be all right. -Christ. -Who's that, Attila the Hun? -Fuckin'... [indistinct chatter] [rock music] Hey Malkey, we've got a visitor. -Glen, ya boss, Glen! -[shouting] -Lex, open up the bloody door! -Ow, ow! -Open the bloody door! -[banging] -No, I need help. -Come here, come here! -Help me! -[all speaking indistinctly] Glen, give us that, ya bastard. -Lex, come on! -Come on, you! -Come on, come on! -Yes! -Off those fuckin' bikes, now! -[shouting] -Get 'em! -Get' em! -[screams] -[laughter] -What time do you call this? -Mum, I'm 18. But you're not, Lex, I've been worried sick. -Where did you get that shirt? -I found it. -I found it. -Brand new. I must have cost at least three pounds. -I found it. -He's a wee liar. -Lex, ya stole it? -No! -Did you steal that shirt? -[laughter] And I don't need that from you! How is it me all of a sudden? Get to bed, all of you just get out of my sight. How, hey, how? -Bastard, Glen, ya bastard! -[cracking] -Bobby! -Back off! -[screams] -Ma! -Head banger. -Shut it, Lex. Give. Bed. These are really good, lad. That's it, end of sketch book. What do you mean, come on Lex, let me see it. -Let me see it, come on. -No, it's nothing. Lex, that is brilliant, I've never seen myself -like that before. -You think I'm an idiot, -don't you? -Lex, will you stop carrying on, I think it's excellent. -Admit it, it's rubbish. -Will you shut up? Lex, it's a very, very good drawing. You like that, it's Perusia in Italy. -Have you been there? -Aye. You should see it, I mean, I always spent the summer with my dad, we stayed by a river, you know, it's funny, I had a dog and I felt like I belonged there but I was a stranger really and grown men hug each other -in the street. -Ugh. -[chuckles] -Look at this. -What an amazing object. -It's for you. -A present. -Are you sure? -I mean, it looks valuable. -I found it. Really, where did you find it? -In a bin, actually. -Lex, you're blushing. Hi dad, that's right, wrapping his vines against the frost. 15 years and not a single grape. Vines, in the middle of Scotland. [indistinct chatter] -Hey you, what's your name? -What? Never mind what, I asked your name. -Handsome, isn't he? -Aye, like plastic. -Excuse me. -Look at it. Couldn't point it's way out a paper bag. Big fight come with the Tongs today. How come you're not with the Glen? -You're too good for them? -Bet he fights like a lassy. Well, I don't fight with girls. [shouting] Ya better fight back, son, Cagney'll beat the shite -out of you. -[shouting] -Hey gents, fight. -[shouting] -That's enough. -[moaning] Maybe you should stop now. You're gonna kill him, leave him alone! Stop it, that's enough, Christ, stop it! -Jack off. -[dramatic music] 30 crates, that's 720 bottles. -What's this? -Bobby, don't enquire. Just do what Big Doug tells you, okay? What's happening here, I'm [indistinct] in this team. -Welcome to it, Bobby. -It's best -to throw them broken. -Aye, very good Bobby. Hey, we man, come and say hello to your Uncle Charlie! -No chance. -Come on. -Come on, Lexi. -Oh, for fuck's sakes Sloane. Oh, just being affectionate. [rock music] Go ahead, Bobby. Where's Johnson, Malkey Johnson? Come on, Sloane, come on, Sloane! [shouting] -Ah, it's cut, it burns! -It's just cut. -You've still got your looks. -Bastard. -Who did this? -Bastard. -Was it, Bobby? -No! [shouting] -Hey, Malkey! -Glen! [shouting] Whoo, did ya see that, Malkey Johnson's killed Glen! [shouting] [stuttering] Always good to me. -You, you got jumped today? -Doesn't matter. -A clay pigeon. -So what the fuck's -a clay pigeon? -Are you taking the piss? Aye, all right, Bobby, whatever you say. -A clay pigeon. -What's going on here? Oh nothing, just that B-O-B-B-Y -went for a W-A-L-K. -What's he saying? -Lex. -I'm saying -that he's a M-O-R-O-N! -Lex! -What's he saying? -Nevermind him, Bobby. -Did you hit it with Fabio? -What? The team goat, that's what, basket case! Jesus, Bobby, do you remember when we were kids? -Do you remember dad? -What? -No. -Do you remember... I couldn't do anything wrong but he was always on at you. -Do you remember that? -No. You must do, Bobby, you're older than me. As a matter of fact and you never knew this but before he died, he apologised to me. Fuck, Bobby, that's just crap -and you know it. -No, it isn't, no, it isn't. [mysterious music] Hello, Lex, Lex? Hey, where's the Tongs? Not much at football are you, son? -I saw you earlier. -That's right. -I scare easily. -You in the Tongs? Nah, I'm a pacifist, between you and me, -the Tongs is a load of crap. -What's your name? Garbles, my family moved from the Garbles two years ago. My real name's George and that's cracking shirt. Thanks, I was thinking of joining the Tongs. -How old are you, son? -13, you? -16. -You're awful wee -for 16 Garbles. -I smoke a lot. -You know the Tongs, then? -Know them? I live with one, he's my step-brother, here. It's just me, my step-brother and two step-sisters and wee Harriet but we keep her away. -No adults? -No. There are the old ladies next door. But isn't that against the law or something? We don't really see much of the law down here. Anyhow, it's like a kinda experiment, like a kibbutz. -Maria, Lex. -Have a seat, Lex. -Has he gone out? -He's due back. -Aye. -[indistinct chatter] -You over there. -Thanks, Malkey. -Malkey? -Malkey, there's boy -to see you. -What boy is that? -[indistinct chatter] -Aye. Introduce the boy here, Malkey. His name's, what's your name again? -Lex. -Lex. -What are you staring at? -I'm not. He's here to join the Tongs, Malkey. -The Tongs? -[laughter] Do you know what mental is, son? -No. -Mental's, nothing gets in your way, do you know what I mean? It's a state of mind, it's like, a wee boy comes into ya house. I mean, he's really wee, maybe 13 but you don't like his face, you stab him anyway. Mental is doing time for the murder 'cause you don't give a fuck, do you think you could do that, son, do you think you could be mental? -Aye. -Where are you from? -Postal Street? -No, Govan Hill. What, Govan Hill, Garbles, what's going on here? He wants to join your team so I brought him up -'cause he seems all right. -And what's Tongs going to do with a stunted midget from Glen, lad? I don't know, maybe a spy, yeah, a spy. -Yeah. -So what is he going to tell us, what do you know about Charlie Sloane? Well, he's kind of, Sloane's very fine. He lives with his dad, I think he eats a lot. What do you even want to know? How about Joanne McGavin, is Sloane screwing here? -No, no he isn't. -So you know Joanne McGavin? -No, no I don't. -So how do you know Sloane -isn't screwing her? -Easy on, Malkey. She's just a wee bird, ya know. Welsh, am I the leader of this team? -So? -So don't embarrass me. I've got company, if I wanted to find Bobby Maclean on his own, how would I do that? I don't know but I think Charlie Sloan goes skating -on Sandy Mullins. -That's Sloane. -I asked about Bobby Maclean. -He's a slow thinker. A bit of a mommy's boy, a bad temper, I don't know. -He's very unpredictable. -What about -Maclean's brothers? -What brothers? Fuckin' useless, Welsh, take this wee shite -out on the stairs. -Hang on a second, Malkey. I said something about Sloane going skating. So, Sloane goes skating, where? -Across Beluff, with his team? -No, with a couple of girls, -I think. -No team? No, now mind you, that was a while back. Oh, that was a while back, Welsh. No, he goes every week, he told me personally. Who knows, we never had a spy before. Saturday morning, be there, Garbles, -show him out. -I just wanted to say, it's been wonderful to see you all. Really, I, I feel like a new person. A man can feel like a failure sometimes if... Andrew, your taxi's waiting. Yeah, well if you ever get tired [indistinct] -There's always Seattle. -We know, Andrew. See ya, kid, bye, Lorna. -Ma, I need to talk to you. -What about? What did you want to talk about? Nothing special, I just thought we should talk. -No, no, no, no! -Maybe Garbles -would like to talk to us now. -[Garbles moaning] Just know that the answer's yes. -What's the verdict? -You don't want to know. -Try me. -The wee shite is Bobby Maclean's brother, Lex Maclean. -That's not good. -No, no. It gets better, this is great. In fact, he's the one that shoots me in the eye with the air gun, remember? And now the other brother's screwing my girlfriend. I mean, you've got to hand it to them. That's a remarkable family. It's beautiful, Alan and I don't mean me. I mean it, I'll treasure it, always. -Where are you going? -Skating. It's a regular thing with me and Polly. -Just the two of you? -Well, actually Charlie's going as well. -It's his weekly outing. -You can't go out with every hard man in Glasgow, -you know? -Look, you don't know him. All he wants to do is go round the ice with me and Polly and hold our hands, round and round, okay? That's all there is to it, you should see the face on him. -Like a wee boy. -Do you know -what that guy's capable off? -Listen, I don't make these rules Alan, okay? Well you can't go out with him anymore, that's it. -That's it? -Yeah. Well, you know what you can do with your that's it, don't you? [rock music playing] Hey, I like that boy, don't you, Joanne? Or maybe it's you, Charlie. Bobby! Bobby! Whoa! -Polly! -[girl screams] [laughter] -Do you need a hand? -[laughter] -[laughter] -[screaming] -[laughter] -Charlie? -Bastard, bastard! -Bobby? -You'll be all right. -[dramatic music] [indistinct chatter and laughter] Lex, come on in and for goodness' sake, comb your hair. -And she falls for that? -The tattoos did it for him. -Sit down, Lex, go on. -[laughter] So where have you been, Lex? -Out. -Well, they get so solemn -at his age. -So Aunt Lorna -how about a song? -Oh, no. -[doorbell rings] -Get the door, Lex. -Lex! -[sighs] -What's up with him? -Don't know. Some kind of trance, probably. [melancholy music] [crying] Hey missus [indistinct] for that wee boy? -He's a murderer, you know? -You're dead, son! -Hey missus, come here! -Hey, come here! [screams] Tongs! Mum, mum, can we do something? -Mum? -You can go and find the animals that murdered your brother, -that's what you can do. -[crying] -[suspenseful music] -Lex, Lex, Lex? Aw, fuck it, Lex, Lex! Hey Lex, what happened to your shoe? -I'm a murderer. -Are you taking the piss -at me? -How'd you mean? I mean, okay, you were at the skating but you didn't know what was going to happen, so how's it your fault? -Because it is. -How could you have killed your own brother, that's daft. Look Lex, Malkey knows all about you and Alan. Alan, what's it got to do with Alan? Look just go, you're okay, somewhere very far away. -Like where? -I don't know. Edinburgh, maybe, look it's against my principles but you better take this. What's that, wee man, do you think I'm a bad person? It's about Alan and Malkey Johnson, Charlie. Ah Malkey, the twisted lovesick bumper. Sorry, wee man, can't help you. Strictly organised crime from now on. Organised crime, so is that why you're doing the shopping for your mommy, you're a washout, Sloane. Bastard still got my boot. Is the matinee on, you not asleep? I can't sleep, there's tea in the pot and tell Lex to go to bed at once. -Lex? -Isn't he with you? -I thought he was with you. -No. Oh God, I hope he's okay, it's so late. I should've known something like this was going to happen. After everything this family has been through. I'm angry at him, I'm angry at him. I'm so angry, I don't even know if I care if he comes home. -[phone ringing] -Malkey Johnson? -You are dead! -[mysterious music] [screams] -Fuck it. -[gunshots] -[phone rings] -Govan Hill 3056. Lex, Lex, is that you, Lex, don't hang up again. Do you have to go to school today? No, not really, the exams are over. Stay with me today, will you? -[doorbell rings] -Malkey says you have to come to his place now, yous need to talk, please. [rock music playing] -Garbles. -[music stops playing] -Where is she? -She wasn't in. You brought out Lex Maclean here, didn't you? -Aye but... -Well, he came back. With this, so where is he now? And it better be the truth. All right, I believe you, thousands wouldn't. Hey, ya wee bastard, think he'll fuckin' kill me with that, ya bastard, take that, fuckin'... [fun fair music] [suspenseful music] [coughing] [gunshot] -Good morning, kids. -Good morning. Would anyone like to come up and do a handstand for your Uncle Andy? -No. -Now who's birthday -is it this week? -Mine! -The song. -[children singing] Lex, heard the good news, Malkey Johnson's dead. -What? -So don't look so happy. [melancholy music] -Lex, what are you after? -Me? -Nothing. -Can't go back to our place. Come in here. -Garbles, your wee pal's here. -Are you all right? Sure, the bastard's history now. -It was an accident. -Sure, ask the police. It wasn't 'cause I did it so now I'm the killer. Okay, I saved you, that girl Joanne, that idiot brother of yours, I saved you and you owe me, I'm not [indistinct] -and now I'm mental. -Did you stab him, Garbles? It doesn't mean you caused it. They'll never guess, will they, Lex? It was just an accident, wasn't it? You'll be all right, you'll be fine. Good 'cause I'm the leader of the Tongs now. Over here, so I hear you've been -acting a bit strange lately. -Ow! -Where's your grandma? -She had to go -to a nursing home. -But she's your gran. -It's better for both of us. -But that means that you... -Just drop it, Lex. -There's something else. -What? -Can I have my shoe back, -please? -You know I'm going -to London, Lex? -But what about Alan? -What about Alan? -Well, you love him. Love him, I'm 17 years old, Lex. Well what about I come instead, then? Yeah right Lex, maybe in a couple of years. In a couple of years you'll be 19. -So? -I mean, 19! Then again, you'll take any boy that'll take you by then. -It's gonna be all right. -How? How's it going to be all right? We can't see things that far ahead. -Trust me. -If you can't see things that far ahead, how do you know it's going to be all right? Because I'm older than you, remember? Come on, I'll see ya as far as the door. See ya, Lex. Round about then Lorna had a dream. Bobby wasn't dead, he'd gone north and joined a fishing fleet, he was passed. He made friends, he was even popular and they came to think of him as an interesting and wise person. Uncle Andrew married Lorna and came to live on Govan Hill. Hm, just my luck, the only American who ever emigrated -to Scotland. -[laughter] Alan went to art school and moved into his own flat. Sometimes he comes home for a square meal. I don't worry about him anymore. My dream is different, more like a nightmare. I grew hair all over me, I had body odour, I suffered from uncontrollable, senseless impulses. Yet I feel responsible for everything. -I dreamt I was a man. -[fire crackling] Luckily when I woke up I was still a boy. * In the year 2525 * * If man is still alive, if woman can survive * * They may find * * In the year 3535 * * Ain't gonna need to tell the truth, tell no lies * * Everything you think, do and say * * Is in the pill you took today * * In the year 4545 * * Ain't gonna need your teeth, won't need your eyes * * You won't find a thing to chew * * Nobody's gonna look at you * * In the year 5555 * * Your arms hanging limp at your sides * * Your legs got nothing to do * * Some machine doing that for you * * In the year 6565 * * Ain't gonna need no husband, won't need no wife * * You'll pick your son, pick your daughter too * * From the bottom of a long glass tube whoa, whoa *
