From the look of those beautiful lights and decorations, you'd expect this to be a Christmas story. And it is. But above all, it's a family story. The Carter family story. Somewhere in this room that looks like it's inhabited by a teenager is their 16-year-old son Kyle. There he is. And I don't need to tell you a girl lives here. That's 15-year-old Sienna with her best friend, the smartphone. Nope, that's not me. That's Mom and Dad, better known as Jack and Holly. And this whole house is about to go off. Nothing like waking up early in the morning. What fun. - Morning, Mrs. Carter. - Morning, Mr. Carter. Morning, Carter family! Yup, that's me. Bet you didn't see that coming. I've been the family best friend for over 30 years. That's dog years. Started as Jack's best friend, and then Holly's, and now finally the kids'. - Hey, kids, you guys getting ready? Hey, kids, come on! - Ugh... - Sienna, do you have your science project? - Dude, just let me have it for one second! - No, you need to move. - I just want one second! - I was here first. - Sienna? Boy, I love Holly's cooking. Who's ready for pancakes and eggs? - Um, Dad? - Yeah? - Doesn't the tree look kind of crooked? - Maybe a little. - A little? It's practically sideways. Did you even follow the instructions? - Of course I followed the instructions, son. It must be, uh, some sort of design flaw. - You know Ricky from my basketball team? - Yeah. - He gets a real tree every year and it's like, 15 feet tall. - Not everyone has the money for a 15-foot... Christmas tree. Sienna darling, look up. Look up, honey. Up! Thank you. - Thank you, sweetheart. - Who's supposed to walk Buster this morning? - Sienna was. - Kyle was. - Kyle, could you get your basketball off the plate, please? - Oh, that's so gross. - Thank you. - Mom... I'm starving! - Moments away! - Hey, Mom, you need help plating? - No, thank you, sweetie. - Oh, my gosh, my phone is so slow! I better be getting a new smartphone for Christmas. - Uh, cell phones are a little expensive. Maybe you'll get one next year. - If she's getting a new phone, then I'm getting a car. - Well, if he's getting a car... I want a new kitchen. - Okay, okay, listen, maybe next year everyone will get everything they want on their Christmas list. - Next year?! We're not gonna get Christmas presents this year? - Sweetheart, we're getting Christmas presents this year, but next year we'll get bigger ones because I'm gonna be making a lot more money. - Why don't we focus on the blessings we already do have? Like a delicious homemade breakfast. And a wonderfully healthy family. And the time in our schedules to have a meal and talk. - Well, that's Ricky from the team. Gotta go. - Oh, yeah, Courtney's picking me up. - Well... Buster, don't you have anywhere you need to go? Oh, you good boy. Man's best friend. Well, I still love you. - And I love you, sweetheart, and this looks delicious. And this is the Carter family business-- Carter's Bakers. Started in 1949 by Jack's grandfather. - Thank you. Yeah, I know, Jack doesn't look like a baker. Holly is the chef in the family. Jack always envisioned himself traveling the world, becoming a great writer. A wife, kids, me. And finally his dad got sick, so Jack had to take over the family business. Jack feels he never had a chance to fulfill his dreams. - And Holly has come up with a brand-new recipe that I think he will enjoy tremendously. So do me a favor. Serve those to him this afternoon when he gets back from work with his favorite cup of coffee and make sure you tell him how much that Holly and I appreciate him. - I sure will. - No, no, no, no, ma'am-- those are on me. - Thank you! - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Mrs. Harmon, how can I help you today? - A loaf of Holly's wonderful bread-- - Ah. - And a box of cupcakes, please. We're having the girls over for mahjong tonight. Mmm! - I'll tell you a little secret. - Hmm? - I've added a couple of extras because I am sure Bertyl and Margie will be coming over tonight, and they can never eat just one of Holly's cupcakes. - That's true. - And could you tell Herman I said hello and I'll probably be seeing him at the next town hall meeting, but I need his vote to get those crosswalks funded over at the school, so please, please mention that... The bakery struggles a bit financially but has been looking after the family all of these years, but Jack still wants to find a way to make more money for the family, so he dabbles in the stock market at every free moment. He's not very good at it, but you have to love him for trying. - These are for the Clarks. Their maid is picking them up at 3:00. - Ooh, their maid-- that must be nice. - Nice, yes, I'm sure it is. - Listen, I wanted to show you something. Look at this stock. I would love to get in on the ground floor of this mutual fund. I am positive it's going through the roof. - Really, honey? You're a stock market analyst now? I mean, you barely passed algebra in high school. - What are you talking about? I got a "B." - B-minus, and only because I tutored you. - Well, sweetheart, we have to do something. I mean, we're barely making ends meet as it is and Kyle's going to college next year and Lord knows that Sienna wants the most expensive of everything. - Honey, all teenagers do. What's important is the quality time we spend with them. Gotta go, buns in the oven. Customer. - Sammy! I think I know why you're here. - Not that one-- that one! - Oh. Those are my favorite as well. I hope you enjoy that. - What do you say? - Thank you. - You're very welcome. Anything else I can help you with, Mr. Mason? - Just came for the cookie, Jack. - No, no, no, that's on me. - Oh, thanks, Jack-- Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Happy holidays! - Merry Christmas, Mrs. Mason. Bye, Jack-- Merry Christmas. - Honey... you gotta stop giving the pastries away, okay? - It was just a cookie. - It's really sweet, but at some point they gotta pay for 'em. So it was a few days before Christmas and Jack was about to have a brainstorm that was gonna change the Carter family forever. Hey, honey? Yeah? - Come here, you have to see this. - Coming. - Farthering Pines is closing down, but they're offering great rates for one last season. - What's Farthering Pines? - Oh, it's this place I used to love as a kid. - Farthering Pines! Oh... We almost went there... for our one-year anniversary. - Right? - Why didn't you guys go there? - Well... - That's about the time your brother came along. - Figures-- he ruins everything! I heard that! - Weren't we gonna go on our fifth anniversary? - Yeah... - But then Dad got sick and we had to cancel. And we've just been too busy to go ever since. I mean, where has the time gone? - Well, you got her to pay attention for a whole 16 seconds. That's pretty good. - Is it me or is this family just not connecting anymore? - You gotta keep trying, honey, 'cause every time you connect is a victory. Family meeting. Family meeting! We are about to embark on an adventure that the Carter family has not undertaken in many, many years. Not only will it bring us closer together as a family, but it will give me the opportunity to write my number-one-best-selling novel. - Honey! - And I can say it in two words. Christmas vacation. - What about the bakery? - Honey, the bakery's gonna be fine. - So where are we going, Hawaii? - Paris? - Better. Farthering Pines. - Aww... - Fathering Pines? What is that? A camp for dads or something? - No, it's Furthering... Kyle. - Located in the beautiful mountains, with pristine snow. There is hiking, skiing, sledding. We'll have a luxurious cabin with a roaring fire 24/7. We will be as cozy and snug as bugs in a rug. And I promise you all it will be your favorite Christmas ever! - Wait, wait. So we're spending our family Christmas in the wilderness? - That is correct. - Sweetie, what about the cost? Can we afford this? - This is the beautiful thing. It is so affordable that we cannot not do it. - I don't know, Jack, I don't know. - Dad, I'm gonna miss Monica's Christmas party. - Yeah, Dad, and my team's on a holiday basketball tournament. - Please, listen to me. This is so important, okay? Life is just passing this family by. It seems like it was yesterday that you were babies and suddenly I wake up and Sienna is 14! - 15, Dad! - 15! - Oh, it does look exactly as beautiful as it did when we almost went the first time. - This looks really old. Dad, did you do some research on the Internet? - Of course I researched it. And speaking of the Internet, you're gonna love this. We are going off the grid. That's right. No distractions. No cell phones, no iPads, no laptops... no Internet. No... cell phones? - That's correct, and that goes for me too. I'm not gonna bring a laptop. I will be writing on an old-fashioned typewriter. Ding! Skk! - Oh! - What's a typewriter? - It's something old people use. I don't know. - This is an amazing idea. You kids-- you are gonna have the time of your life. Honey... you have made me so happy! Oh! - You have made me so happy, and this is going to make our little family closer than ever. I love you! - Merry Christmas, kids! - They look so glum. So there we were, packing up for the Carter family vacation. - Sienna, what did I say about the phone, sweetheart? - Dad, that's not fair at all. Kyle gets to bring his ball. Nothing like a road trip to bring the family closer together. - I hardly think that's the same thing. - Yeah, Sienna, definitely not the same thing. I mean, can't take selfies and snapshots all day with my ball. - Okay, well, what if there's a blizzard and an earthquake and it causes an avalanche and bears start to attack us and we're lost and we don't have a phone and we need to use mine? - Okay, okay, listen, I will lock Mom's phone up in the glove box in case there's an emergency but I want you to put your phone in the house, thank you. - Dad, it's a flip phone! It doesn't even haven Internet on it! And so began the Carter family vacation that would change their lives forever. ♪ I have to go to the bathroom. Can we stop? After we just stopped for Kyle. - Like, I need to go-- please stop. We have to get our schedules together, kids, okay? ♪ Ugh, we've been driving forever! Basketball's lame. Let me tell you something. I am gonna be able to get some writing done up here. Wow, this is majestic. ♪ At least it seemed like a good idea at the time. I'm hungry. Can we go get something to eat, please...? ♪ Look at the sights up here! Oh, look at the creek! Oh, oh, oh, this little bridge? My favorite. I used to play down here when I was a kid. And Sienna, aren't you happy now that you're not gonna be using a phone? - Argh, I don't know what to do with my energy. I literally having texted in like, days! We're almost there, kids. Look at the sign-- huh? Farthering Pines... What do you think, Buster? Oh! That's the one... that was the one from the picture! This is it right here. - Oh, Jack... The country. Fresh air... the mountains... snow, pine trees. - Made it. I was sold. - Honey...! Oh, man, that took forever. - What are you talking about? It was only three hours. Wow, I miss home already. - I love it. - Let's go inside. Oh...! - Ah... this is it. This is the cabin I used to come to when I was a kid with Grandpa. - It's adorable. - What do you say we go inside and then we can unload the car? - Yeah. Come on, Buster. You wanna go inside, buddy? Come on, guys, shake it out. Let's get warm. ♪ - This place is so small. - Well, I think it's charming. - Is this what the old days looked like? - Well, it is their least expensive cabin. - Figures! - We chose it because it has family meaning. - You know what? I bet they haven't even remodeled this since you and Grandpa were here last. - It... does look remarkably familiar. - This is gonna be interesting. - You know what? They are so lucky I don't have my phone right now and I would review them and give them one star! - Well, I've got some good news for you, sweetheart. You and your brother get to share a room. Bunk beds. - Seriously? - I call top bunk. - Bunk beds! Fun! What are we gonna do with them? Let's get these bags off, buddy. - All right, Dad. - Wow, it's coming down! Go on the other side, go on the other side. Can you get it? - Yeah. - All right, last one in's a rotten egg. So Jack could not be happier, spending time with his son, his beautiful wife's cooking, his loving daughter getting used to the place. - Whew! Okay, firewood, where are you? Where would you be if you were firewood? Well, I would be right here but... Kyle? Okay... So I looked all around for some firewood, I couldn't find any, which means that you and I are gonna go on a little firewood expedition. - All right. - Well, we have central heat. - Honey, we're in a cabin in the middle of winter. Besides, my dad used to start a fire all the time and it just wouldn't be right if I didn't okay? - You're right, but I'm cold now, so I'm gonna turn it on. - Good idea. You ready? - Yeah, let's go. - Well... That is for you, my friend. You know what? This reminds me of when I used to go gather wood with my dad. And I bet one day you might just be out here with your son. - Can't wait. Jack had all these wonderful plans to show his kids where his dad had taken him. The sledding, the tree chopping, building a fireplace-- a handing-down of generation to generation. A true Christmas vacation. Shouldn't we be looking on the ground? You know, where we can actually get to the wood? - Yeah, but... my dad used to teach me to look up high for a clearing. You wanna try to find a spot where the sun's coming through and drying out the branches. - So just any one of 'em? - Well... We don't wanna harm the living ones. We just wanna find the dead ones so we can break the branches and chop 'em up easier. And when everything seems like it's falling into place, that's when life throws you that curve ball. - Buster, snow! We men! We make a fire! - Jack! - Robert? Why, hey, how are ya? - Well, I'm, I'm great. I mean, uh, just plain old perfect. Wow! You look like you're doing wonderful. - Oh, life is amazing! It's like winning the lotto every day. - Honey bunny, you got your family right here as well. - I'm sorry, I'm Robert. This is my beautiful wife Eva. This little guy, that's Tommy, our son. - Oh, oh-- this is my wife, Holly-- she's the love of my life, my flower, my everything. - Uh, okay. Nice to meet y'all. - Hello. - Uh, and this is Kyle. - He's a all-star basketball player. - How's it going? - And this over here... - I'm Sienna. - ...is, uh, my daughter. And the man of the family-- - - Buster. - That's a very handsome dog for a very handsome family. Oh... - Uh... so... I'm sorry, maybe I'm just beat. How do the two of you know each other? - Well, it's, uh... kinda funny, to be honest, but Robert and I used to come here when we were kids together. - And we've been coming up every year, ever since this guy was small. - Yeah. - As a matter of fact, it's the same place that we used to stay with your dad. - No-- no, no. Actually this is the place that we used to stay at with my dad. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I mean, I have photos of us standing in front of it. - How cute. - Wow, I just... I don't remember it being so small. That place is tiny. Uh, we just picked up some gourmet coffee beans. We have a beautiful espresso machine at the house. Why don't you guys come over for some hot chocolate, okay? Give us a chance to get the families to get to know each other... - I do! - ...we can chat. - Yeah, guys, let's go. - Great idea. Oh, my God... - Place right across. - You can't miss it. - ...so weird. Please come... and welcome. You'll love it here. Wow, talk about a vacation home. Yup, I was in love. - Welcome! - Hi! - Hey. - Oh, my heart, is he clean? - Honey, don't worry. - Oh! Buster! - No, Buster, get down! Buster! - Don't worry about it. - Oh... is this what heaven looks like? I thought heaven for her would be like, a giant cell phone with a battery that never dies down. - Kyle, get over yourself. - Do you want a... - Yeah! - ...tour of the house? - Yeah. - It's fine, don't you worry. - Sorry, sorry, Buster's an imbecile. - Oh, my God, yeah, it's just I've never had animals-- - Sweetheart, we have a housekeeper. She'll clean it up. Let him enjoy himself. - All right, make yourself at home. - So, what do you think? - I mean, you could fit five of our cabins inside this one. Hey, can I borrow your phone just to take a picture to send to one of my friends? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah, just... - I don't know how you ever wound up with such a deal. - Well, there's days, I mean... - I, I don't get it. - ...stuff to do. - A big-screen TV? - So y'all were friends when you were little. Or-- you must have been, 'cause you went on vacations together. - Yeah, we were friends. - We were very good friends. - I mean, we weren't best friends. - We drifted apart. - You know, we just kinda lost touch. - Which is a shame. - Honey bunny, you want the usual in yours? - Yes, darling. - That is a shame. - But... we have now to catch up, right? - Exactly. I mean, why don't you tell me how you joined the ranks of the one percent? - Well, I don't know if we're really there... but we're not far off. I, I just, uh... I don't know, I got bored in college and I started to dabble in the stock market. Turns out I'm pretty good at it... thank you. - Oh, Robert is just being modest. He's actually a genius at it. - Well, I, I did make my first million by the time I was a junior and I haven't looked back. Uh, I just would invest in, uh, you know, small businesses. Computer graphics software, restaurants, you name it. Whatever it was... somehow it flourished. So you all met in college. Oh, no. No, Robert is a lot older than I am. - Oh, I, I didn't mean to... It's just that Robert looks so young and... so do you. - Oh, well, thank you. Well, unlike Robert, I haven't had any work done, but I understand the confusion 'cause, um, well, I had Tommy at a very early age. - And you're a stay-at-home mom. - No, no, no, no, no, actually I am the owner and executive chef of Ed Garbanzo's. - Wow. - Yeah, well. - What? - It's a five-star restaurant in Beverly Hills. - Oh! - Two Michelin stars. - Nice! - She learned everything from her father, an excellent chef. Tell us what you've been up to, Jack. You were such a dreamer back in school. Did you ever do anything with those short stories you were writing? Did you ever get 'em published? - Y... uh, I... have five number-one best sellers. - Really? Which books? - He's joking. A guy can dream. Um, you know, after my father died, we started running the bakery, so we've been doing that for the past five years. And Holly is an amazing baker and pastry chef. - Oh, a bakery. Uh, doughnuts. - Little cupcakes. - Cute. Well, Holly, that'll be great. You and I can talk shop while you're here. - Mm-hmm, definitely. - Like I said, if you guys ever get bored, your cabin's right... Sometimes you just don't talk about really anything while you're getting to know each other. - ...smells bad too. Yours smells really good-- and it's clean too. I'm pretty sure there's something dying in ours. - And we got the wonderful view out back. We can always go sledding and tubing right in the backyard too, so... - Whew, it's beautiful. - It's crazy. - Hey, the game's on tonight. - Yeah. - Let's go watch it, dude, let's go. - ...your father's footsteps. He was, he was... - We miss him, we do. Now, listen, we should let you enjoy your castle. - Oh, no, stay! I love your intelligent dog. - There 's a game. They have a big screen, Dad. - Yeah, Dad, and Tommy's gonna play his guitar. - Oh. - I only know a few chords. - He's a rock star. Let's go, come on. - No, no, listen, I'll pop open a bottle of Dom, we'll fire up the hot tub. - Stick around. - Hot tub? Hot tub, Jack. - Yeah... thank you all for your hospitality. - Goodness, I hope it's not on account of the dog. He was actually really quite well-behaved. - Uh, we love him. - Hey... - You, my friend... I mean, wow. This place is impressive. I mean, you've done great for yourself-- I'm proud of you. - Jack, you're making it seem like it's good-bye forever. We're gonna be hanging out all week, buddy. Well, you know where to find me. In the little cabin. ♪ - Well, you guys are welcome back to the big cabin any old time. We're gonna be firing up the grill soon. We got that thing cooking now, right? - Yeah. - It's a little hot. I told you, you just have to get some oxygen to those flames. Good job. - Thanks, guys. - Way to go! - Okay, who's ready for a little action-packed family time, huh? Sienna? Wanna play some charades? Cards, huh? Have a checker tournament... you wanna have a checker tournament? What? - I miss my phone... - What? - I'm going to bed. - That's... okay, good night. Guess it's just the three of us. What do you wanna do? - Yeah. - I don't know. I'm pretty tired-- I think I'm gonna go to bed too and just fall asleep listening to the game on the radio. - Are you kidding me? - Good night, guys. - You don't wanna play games? What is the matter with everybody tonight? - It's our first night here and it was a long day. - Yeah, tell me about it. - Besides... You and I can enjoy the fire together. I love you, sweetheart. - I love you too. - Hey...! - Whoa! - We thought we'd invite you and your family out for a hearty breakfast at Fresco's. - The food is to die for. It's absolutely fabulous. - And afterwards we're going up on the mountain on snowmobiles. - Come on, Carters, you gotta come. - Dad, let's go, come on. - Yeah, Dad, let's go. - Kids, your dad already made plans. - Yes... or we would. - Jack... I'm paying for everything-- it's on me. - Oh, no-- no, no, I couldn't do that. - What 's money if you can't see other people enjoy things with you? Besides, I've already paid for the snowmobiles and they're non-refundable. - Dad...? - What? No. What about Buster? - Leave him. - Bring him! Plenty of room in the car. - Bring him... okay. Well, okay... bring him. Maybe it'll be fun. - Buster... Buster! You don't wanna snowmobile? - Whoo... That's right, we got this! Whoo-hoo! - Whoo! - Are you okay? - Yeah! - Hey, Kyle. So, I'll tell you one thing. This guy knows how to enjoy himself. He was definitely endearing himself to the family. - Can you wave? Can you wave to Mama? Lookit, look, Buster! - Whoo! - Whoo...! - Ha...! - Is that beautiful or what? Huh? Farthering Pines! What do you say, Buster? Come on, Buster. - That was fun. - That was great! You kidding me? - How about hot chocolate? - Oh, I'd love some. I'll come-- What, Ghirardelli's? Do you have that? - Uh, Hershey's? - Oh, I've never had that. - Wasn't that the best? - Hey, thank you, man, seriously. I mean, I've never had $30 eggs Benedict before. - Yeah, well, hopefully that's not the last time. I'm telling you, a little perseverance, hard work, luck, you're gonna be fine. You're gonna be writing that novel before you know it. - Well, from your mouth to God's ears. - Hey, uh... - What? - Ring a bell? - Snowshoes? - Yeah! Come on-- your dad, winters up here... - Carl Carter's Farthering Pines Winter Olympics. - Olympics! He used to make all the kids in the neighborhood compete in the snowshoe races. - When we did the inner tube races, remember those? - The snowman building. - Oh, and the snowman bowling. - And the worst, the cross-country skiing. - Don't even bring it up, I hated that. - You were horrible at that. - Wait a second, we were horrible at that. - You sucked-- you came in last place every time. - No, except for the times you came in last place. - No, I might have come in second to last place, but you owned-- - No, no, but wait. You know my favorite thing of all? Was when we spent hours hiking for that magical Christmas tree. - Oh, that tree. Arbol de... Navidad Perfecto! - Right? Whoever found it would have eternal happiness. - Riches beyond your wildest dreams. - You know, why are they closing this place down? - It's sad. - I mean, you have the swankiest cabin, I've got that little Daniel Boone model. - Yeah, well, the owners, they were trying to remodel and they were trying to bring in a higher class of people and they ran out of money, which is why some of the places are great and some of the places are dumps. I mean, anybody could afford to live there. But they forgot about the middle class. They need a consistent clientele. - No, wait, I'm... I'm middle class. - Yeah, okay. Come on! Let's do this! - Wait-- no, let's not. - Come on, let's do this thing! - Wait, wait, we're racing again? - Let's go...! - Are we 10? - On the line! - Robert, come on, seriously. - All right, here's the deal. We do from here, around that tree, and back. Whoever here's first, okay? - I'm tired already. - Good. - Go! - Go! - Ah, watch out... - Get out of my way! I'm coming! - And turn! - Aah... - Aah! - Hey, Mom, look at Dad over there. What 's he doing? - I got you now, sucker! Aah... Aah...! - Oh... - Jack! - Whoo-hoo! The winner...! Yeah...! Revisiting your youth is not so easy sometimes. - Jack? Jack? What on earth? - You all right, Daddy? - I think he pushed me down. Honey... Oh, yeah! I'm sorry I beat ya. - Oh, no, hey, all in good fun, right? - Tomorrow we can try something different. You know, mix it up. - No, you know. - Come on! - As much as I appreciate your generosity, you know, and you spending all this time with my family, I... I gotta pass. I mean, we should really just, uh, spend some time alone together, you know? Maybe even get my, my novel started. - Well, we at least gotta have dinner together, no? - Come over for dinner. - Yeah! - You know, uh, thank you, Eva, but Jack's right. We really need to spend some time together just as a family. I think I'm just gonna grill some burgers out tonight. - Hamburgers? Oh, yeah! - Can Tommy eat with us? - Well, honey, it's family time. - Yeah, not tonight. - Yup, and Tommy, I am making my famous stuffed chicken. Let me tell ya, I stuff it with, oh, spinach, pesto... - Oh, pesto! - ...and feta. It is delicious! You're gonna love it, I swear. - Eva? - Yeah? - I season the heck out of my burgers. - She makes the best burgers in the world. With all the fixings and trimmings, it'll make you wanna hug your neighbor. - Well, all right to that. All right, you guys enjoy your burgers, but how about we get together later for some dessert? - Yeah! - Yes, dessert. - You know what? Not tonight. - All right, tomorrow... morning... breakfast? - Holly, breakfast. - Wait, wait, dessert for breakfast? - Come on! - No, they're the best crepes where they're taking you. You're gonna love it. - See you in the morning, Carters. - It's done, it's done. It was a great day. - Bye, Carters. If you miss us, you know where we live! - Bye, guys! What is going on here? So the family was working on reconnecting. At least... they were trying. - So... this... this is quality family time? - Sienna. - I'm amazed that you've been able to keep quiet for a few moments. - Hey, I'm sorry, Tommy lives really far away. I don't have that much time with him. You met him this morning! And he is just a boy. This is your family! - Dad was just a boy before he became Dad to you. - Husband to Mom. - Okay, whatever, it's the same thing. - It's been a couple of days since you've had your cell phone. You haven't complained about that-- I'm proud of you. - That's because she's been all over Tommy's phone. - It still shows some effort, okay? And I am proud of you. Besides, what would you be doing different if you were on the web, hmm? I mean, can't you just comment to us whatever it is you'd be tweeting on Facebook? Yeah! Dad, you can't tweet on Facebook. That's, that's not how it works. - No? Well, why don't you just tell me what you would do then? - Um... I'd just post pictures where me and my friends are hanging out or I'd comment on their pictures. - Okay, well, let's just pretend you took a family photo and you posted it. What would you say? - Okay, um... "With the parents, the dog and the annoying brother." Heart sign. - Hey! - Heart sign! - You see, we can communicate like this. Disturbing. - I'm not talking like that. - Fine-- why don't you tell us about the story of you and Brad at the park the other day playing basketball. What happened with that? - Yeah, honey, you never told us what happened. - Yay! Another story about a ball going through a ring! Dad's idea for commentary. - All right, you guys want the extra-long version? - Yes. - All right. Well, me and Brad went to the park and we played a game of ball. The end. - Hashtag.

Well, you see the principle behind it was to keep people from typing too fast, which would prevent the typewriters from jamming. - Well, why don't they just update it? Computers don't jam and people could type faster. That is a very good idea, but I kinda think people are a little used to it now. Oh, in the old days, uh, people's personal journals were kinda like their Facebook pages, did you know that? - Really? - Yeah. - Here, put your two pointers right here and here. - Here? - Yup.
