CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS THE TOWER PICTURES Wake up, sleepyheads! Wake up! Wake up, sleepyheads! Wake up! It's Christmas eve warmer than usual by about 7 degrees. Due to a migratory anticyclone bringing clear spells, unfortunately, we won't be having a white Christmas. It's not going to snow. Hey. Do you believe the weather girl or your daddy? Duh. Of course the weather girl. You lied to me about Santa for 3 years. It's every child's duty to be fooled about Santa. Ha! Come to dad's workplace after school and see for yourself if I'm a liar. Grandma says you're like this because you never married. I lose sleep worrying about you. You were snoring all night just fine. Have a little faith in daddy. Because it's going to be the best Christmas ever. Promise? Cross my heart. Last year's party was quite a spectacle. The Bolshoi ice show? It generated millions in publicity value. At a tough time like this. All thanks to you, Mr. Jo. There is a need for a paradigm shift in the real estate market. From a market dictated by schools and commercial districts to the one where residential quality creates value. So, what's this year's shift going to look like? Wouldn't you rather be surprised? Just a bit of a heads up. Welcome to Tower Sky. Let me give you a brief introduction. Tower Sky consists of twin towers, River View and City View providing home for 5,700 residents in 1,700 units in the most luxurious apartments in Korea. The towers are connected by a sky bridge at level 70. Here, we have a sky garden... Sorry to interrupt but what kind of apartment doesn't allow you to order Chinese delivery? You gotta have black bean noodles on moving day. Sure, sir. Simple meals like black bean noodles are provided free for residents in the food court. Really? Yes, Mr. Kim. That explains the price tag. How is the party preparation going? In full swing, sir. And the number of residents attending? The RSVP list was full as of last week thanks to last year's success. What about the helicopters? 10 choppers on stand-by for the spectacle. Mr. Chairman. One moment. Don't toss knives into the sink, you fool! Put that horrid weapon away. It's your face that's horrid. Come here, you! Good morning. Miss Seo. Never a dull moment. Let's give the morning a fresh start. Am I supposed to be your mother? Everything going okay with the VVIP pre-orders? Yes, ma'am. Are we all set, Chef? Yes, madam. The French ambassador chose Chateau Lafite Rothschild. Can you confirm the sauce for the escargot? Escargot will be prepared in a Burgundy style. All needs to be double-checked. Right away, ma'am. When is the Kobe beef coming in? Transportation team will pick it up from the airport at noon. Marry me, Min-jeong Eun-sae, darling! Where are you? I was about to buzz your house. Did you just see a Lhasa Apso? Excuse me? A puppy, about this big. Who are you? I just moved into the building. No... thank you We don't really eat rice cakes. - Oh, a lotto winner! - Excuse me? You won the lottery, didn't you? How did you know that? Lotto winners seem to do the rice cake thing a lot. Look forward to being good neighbors. I hope you don't take this the wrong way. But this place is different from where you used to live. Where on earth did she go? Eun-sae! Eun-sae. Wow... Hey! You must be Eun-sae. Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Hello. Hi. It's these screens again. Yesterday, it was the sensor and now the screens. It's always something. That's weird, isn't it? Come in, Control Room Can you check B0172? What for? You shut them down deliberately. You'll look into the problem? Right away, please. It's your lack of confidence that needs checking. For crying out loud, be a man! Just ask her out. You're breaking off. Perhaps I should try to be somewhere else tomorrow. Why? Something always breaks whenever I'm around. That's not true. The screens on 65 seem to be working fine. But I suppose they'll break down soon, too. Right... Hey! A special delivery for you. What are you doing here? It's okay. You should go. This is a real special ice cream. Just have a taste. - I will later, okay? - just the top scoop. What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be busy? Get your ass back in the kitchen. Now! Yes, sir. Get out of here. Oh no...Honey, I'll be right back. Mr. Cha, you shouldn't eat that. Aren't you too old have a secret crush on someone? It's the perfect opportunity. Do me a favor Ask her out. I have my own plans. You're just unbelievable. Hey, how come you always get dumped? Shut up. Mr. Yun. You let her have all the control. You think so? To have the upper hand, you must remember the '369 rule'. What's that? Do not send more than 3 text messages a day. Do not reply within 6 minutes of receiving a text. Never return a text message after 9 pm. I see. Show her the man you are. It's Christmas eve. Am I interrupting a date? Take a seat, Mrs. Jeong I'll let you have him today. Thanks, darling. Why are you always late? Sorry? Turn off the stove in 3 minutes. - I beg you, okay? - Sure. - You two, come with me. - Yes, Chef. You peel onions with tears not your hands. I'm out of here as soon as I get the paycheck. Jeez... It's so hot in here. Oh my God! Fire! Fire! Fire! Four. Four. All in. Are you going all in, too? All in... Hold for a second. Dispatch! Dispatch! Response 73, Response 73 All crew for immediate dispatch. Q 4 cards... I've got Q 4 cards. Yeouido station dispatching backup. Response 73 canceled. I repeat, response 73 canceled. I had Q four cards, damn it. Come back here. What are you looking for? Where'd my hand go? Excuse me, officer. Where can I find the fire chief? Look! Q four cards. Who the hell are you? Damn it. What's the matter with you people? How are you running things around here? I'm sorry, sir. What happens in the kitchen is your responsibility. But there are innate problems with the architectural design. Architectural design? Do you know how many stoves there are in the kitchen? We don't have adequate ventilation. Lack of ventilation gives rise to complaints from customers. This kitchen wasn't designed for practicality. I think we may have faulty fire sprinklers. What about the sprinklers? I'll have to carry out a proper survey but there seems to be no water in the pipes. No water? Mr. Cha. Mr. Lee! Party preparation Let's focus on party preparation for now. And I'll see you after the party. Firefighter Lee Seon-woo reporting for duty at Yeouido station as of December 24, 2011. Are you ready for the job? I'll give my best to be a good firefighter, sir. A good firefighter? A good firefighter... Hey, what makes a good firefighter? I suppose those that stick it out to the end. Sergeant. Let's go. Come on. Sir, I was taught that all crew must be on standby at all time ready for a prompt dispatch. And? It didn't seem to me that the regulations were properly followed. Taking a good rest is a part of the job, too. But, sir... This is your spot. Make yourself at home. - Hey, rookie. - Sir? Get yourself cleaned up. Do I need a shower to receive my gear? It's like this. How would you feel if your bride didn't have shower on the wedding night? She's not in the right frame of mind for the wedding night. And you're not in the right frame of mind to receive your first gear. Get yourself cleaned up and be ready for your gear. Is Captain Kang off duty today? What about him? He is a living legend among the cadets at the fire academy. A legend? They don't talk about me? What's your name, sir? Forget it It'll only give you a headache. Here you are. Thank you. Thank you for defending me earlier. It was nothing. Look! Mistletoe. Pardon? Mistletoe? Don't you know what it is? On Christmas day you must kiss under the mistletoe. Really? I had no idea. I swear that's not why I asked you to meet here. Are you alright? I love hot coffee. Good Lord, is this real marble? Does it look like brick? This is like heaven. You're right. This is heaven. You'll see when you're dispatched to the scene. 90% of firefighters don't do much at the scene. Are you listening to me? Yes, sir. Firefighters experienced in firefighting, rescue and evacuation, there are only handful and I'm that man. It's a great privilege for a probie to train under such supervisor. Man... What are you doing? Get ready for dispatch. But I don't have my gears yet. Sergeant? Sergeant? Sergeant. Sergeant Oh! Oh... Hello. Sir. Hurry up, probie But, sir. Move your ass over here. Sir. Congratulations and celebrations. On joining Yeouido station. Congratulations and celebrations. On joining Yeouido station. - Attention, probie! - Look at him. Awesome. Boo! Scared you, didn't I? When will you grow up? Where is dad? He still has some wrap up to do. Do you want to meet this lady that your dad likes? - A lady? - Yeah. No water is detected above the 60th floor. Where do these pipes connect? Plumbing was moved to outer walls to make room for shops. 80th floor? Can't go that far up But what could really happen? Don't forget the party tonight. Try to come home early, okay? Madam, your puppy soiled the floor. Yes? The regulation is for owners to pick up after their dogs. Why don't you do it? Isn't that what you're paid to do? I'll clean it up today but you should do it yourself next time. Is that some kind of a threat? What's your name? Oh, madam... I asked your name. Wow. - Like it? - Totally. Why is daddy always so busy? Exactly my thoughts. Mr. Cha, I figured out the problem. The pipes on the outer wall are frozen over interrupting water supply to the sprinklers between 60 and 80. We'll need additional fire extinguishers until the problem is fixed. Dae-ho. Don't you see how insanely busy we are? Forget sprinklers Your attention should be on party preparation. Get your priorities straight. Mr. Cha. Mr. Cha. I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman. Why are they withdrawing approval? There is a risk of a sudden updraft near the top of the towers. Updraft? What should we do now? Get me the Emergency Management Agency. I'll put the aerial service team on the phone. Aerial service? They're in charge of helicopters. No. Put me directly through to the Commissioner. The Commissioner? Right away, sir. Ha-na. Sweetheart? I knew it. It's my job to make sure that everyone is safe. Can you wait just a little longer? You don't know how to talk to girls. Here, let me. Young lady. You made her cry. Come on, sweetheart. What's going on? What's the matter, sweetie? My daddy... Daddy has to go back to work. We gotta look into the sprinkler problem. We really have to go. Well... You know what? Can you watch Ha-na for a second? No, I can't ask her She's real busy. Well, you're busier. Be good, Ha-na. What did you say to her that made her burst into tears? She should go into acting, your little girl. What are you talking about? I said if she wanted to stay with Yoon-hee she should cry. Next thing you know she's wailing. If anyone can win Yoon-hee's heart, it's Ha-na. She'll be the bridge between you love birds. A cupid. Little Miss Matchmaker. What's your type? Muscular and macho or gentle and sweet? What's your blood type? My dad's an O. How do you feel about widowers with kids? I'm okay with gentle and sweet, and type O. But I have a problem with widowers with kids. Unless that kid is as sweet as you. You're giving it to me? I appoint you honorary chef of the day. Daddy! Daddy! Guess who this is. Is that daddy? What about this? Uh... I'm not sure. It's Yoon-hee It's a mess, isn't it? It's because I made it. She made Ha-na and daddy. One big happy family. You're off duty today. Your wife must be happy. Isn't this the first time you're not working on Christmas eve? Your wife's practically a saint. She deserves an award. Will you be finally making a baby? Hey, college boy. Stop calling me that. Did you have lunch? I did. I gotta run. I'm sorry, honey. I asked for a 3-month advance but it's not coming out until afternoon. You should've called then. I haven't seen you in a while because you've been so busy. Don't you worry about the tuition fee. How about we celebrate with dinner at home? I have to pull an all-nighter You finish late, too. Don't skip meals, okay? See you later. - You've got pocket money? - I got it. Yeong-hun... Thank you Have a good day. Sweet white chocolate... Sweet white chocolate... Can I get a sweet white chocolate cake? Medium size, please. I'm sorry but we're a little behind with Christmas orders. Would you like to place an order? For 7 o'clock, okay? Certainly. Thank you. Good bye. Sweet white chocolate... Go home and save your marriage Leave fires to us What do you do next? - Congratulations - Thank you. Thank you for inviting us. We're good to go, sir. Ladies, gentlemen and esteemed guests, it's a truly beautiful night. In this special moment, we are the ones standing closest to the sky. Whatever you expect to see tonight, you'll see more.

Oh my God. Run! Run! Ha-na. Ha-na. All fire escapes are blocked by fire What about that side? It's the same. We should try the Chinese restaurant. The fire originated on the 63rd floor. What's the situation? Until the fuel leaking from the chopper is all burned up, there isn't much we can do. What about initial fire control? The sprinkler system failed. How do we get to 63? You must use the tower ladder to the 19th floor. Then, take the south fire escape. Young-kee, it's much too dangerous. We need to focus on evacuating people rather than containing fire. If we give up the origin, we're giving up everything. We're moving in, Chief. Everyone to report back here at 1200 exact. Every one of you, without failure Understood? Yes, Captain. Unit, enter! Enter. Keep within 3 steps of me at all times. Yes, sir. Stand back. Enter. Enter. Enter. Enter. Enter. That's the quickest route to the point of origin. This way. Hello? Anybody? In here. - Somebody help - Help us! We're stuck in here. In the elevator. Help! Earlier tonight, a helicopter crashed into Tower Sky. There's growing fear as the number of casualties rises. Hi! Newly open just around the corner. - What the hell? - Is that real? Breaking News: Fire at Tower Sky Mom? If only we had an iron stick. - Iron stick! - Iron stick! Come on. - Hurry! - I'm scared. Why is your ass so big? You said you were a size 44. We'll talk when we get out of here. It's the Fire Commissioner. Why is it taking so long? The point of origin is the 63rd floor. Get everyone up there now. Tower ladder can only reach as high as the 19th floor. Is there nothing we can do? In the case of high-rise buildings, the only solution is for the firefighters to tackle fire directly. Hundreds trapped in fire Do we have priority rescue list? We're trying to get the location using helicopters. We'll get to those isolated near the point of origin first. Don't you see what I'm trying to say? This isn't some regular apartment fire. This is 'Tower Sky'. We must get the important people out first. Over here. This is the rescue control Please maintain calm. Where you are now is the safest place. Shush! I repeat, please keep calm. and wait for the rescue dispatch. Over here. Commissioner, this is the priority rescue list. Secure their locations and report to me. Yes, sir. Ha-na. Ha-na.

Wait... You don't understand. Alright, I hear ya. Listen to me. Wait. I have to go back My daughter is up there. Leave it to us and evacuate. It's extremely dangerous here. Could you walk away if your daughter was stranded up there? Damn it! No reception. So much for a high-tech country. Fire in the kitchen Do something. Fire! Fire! Put out the fires. Over there. Over there! It's spreading. Good to see you, too. I express sincere condolences for the families of the deceased. We'll do our best to contain the situation and to prevent another precious life from being... Look! Stop. Find an alternative route. The detour could take us up to 5 minutes. It'll be too late by then. Did you say the fire originated from the server room? I'm the Head of Maintenance and Operation. Can you break through a wall? It's 8-inch concrete. It's possible. Which way is it? You can get directly to the server room through that wall. - Come on. - Okay. Go. Over here. Extinguishers ready Prepare to enter. Yes, Captain. Wait! You'll need this to find your daughter. Call me as soon as you find her. I'll come and get you. Ha-na. Yoon-hee. It's oxygen. Are you alright? Please... Take me with you. I must find my daughter. This is my son's tuition fee. His name is Yeong-hun. His number is 010-2434... One. Two. Enter. Enter. Long time, bastards. Enter from the right. - Follow me, probie. - Yes, Captain. Tackle the side. Keep your focus, probie. Keep up. Maintain formation. Advance! Forward! Stick together. Captain. This is beyond our capacity We must fall back. This is the origin We must contain it no matter what.

Keep up. Run. Good work, sir. The fire at origin is contained. Let me debrief on the evacuation status. People stranded above the point of origin. Are transferred to the adjoining tower through the sky bridge. and are being rescued using helicopters. Those below 50 are being evacuated via fire escape with the assistance of firefighters. This is the problem area. We have a group of people stranded in the restaurant. All passage ways are blocked by fire. It's impossible to escape without the help of firefighters. I'm sorry, Mrs. Jeong. I'm okay now Take some rest. Hang in there a few more minutes. Firemen are on their way. Why aren't they here yet? Bring me water. Sir? There is a vending machine outside. Move your ass. What a bastard! It's open. Fire! Fire! Can't he get his own water? I saw it coming. from when he swallowed that ring. Drinks like a horse, too. In-geon. Help me. Dae-ho. Have you seen Ha-na? She's with Yoon-hee in the restaurant. Thank God. I thought the fire was contained. The fire in the server room is but the flames have spread to the 60th floor and above. Activate the fire walls. You can't. There are still people up there. Mr. Chairman! Back off. If we don't stop this we lose everything. Fire wall activated What's that sound? Shit! Hurry. Come on, man. Dae-ho. Daddy. Ha-na. Daddy! Daddy! My baby. Captain! Captain! Copy. Our position is S-08-4712 The Chinese restaurant. We're isolated by the fire wall. We have injured people as well as a pregnant woman Please hurry. S-08-4712? And the fire wall? It's made of reinforced titanium. We can only get through by blowing it up. When we knock it down step away from the wall. Did you find your daughter? Thanks to you, yes. We're on our way now. Rescue unit is on their way. Do you think we'll make it out? I'm scared. You've done so well. This is the control unit We have a request on 72. Unit 1 to 72 immediately. We're in the middle of a rescue mission. You're closest to the location. Dispatch another unit. This is the Commissioner Get to that location immediately. Dozens of people are suffocating. Are you telling me to turn back with evacuees right in front of me? Captain Kang. This is class 1 situation You can't save everyone in the building. This is an order. Sergeant. Make your way to the fire wall and set up explosive. The rest of the crew will follow me. This way, Captain. Over here. What took you so long? Civil servants these days... You really gotta get your act together. Where are the others? What others? Lead us to safety now. Oh, my baby. Eun-sae. Eun-sae. Eun-sae. My baby. - I thought I lost you. - Unit 1, report status. Rescued a family of 3 including their baby, a goddamn dog. Fuck you, son of a bitch. Is he crazy? Get these people to safety. Come with me, probie. Come on. What's taking them so long? These fire walls are designed to save lives. Looks like they'll kill us. Daddy, look. That's one hell of a fire wall. Firefighters are here. If they blow the wall, the floor will cave in. We must stop them. Stop! You can't blow up the wall. Oh Byeong-man has come to your rescue, poor souls. That's too close. Sergeant! Sergeant! Explosive fracturing has started. Steel frames have been damaged. Due to exposure to high temperatures, the beams will start bending like spaghetti. It can't be happening so fast. The process is sped up with fortified concrete. Watch out. Yoon-hee! This way. Get down. Report status at restaurant section. It's hard to estimate due to thermal fracturing. We're moving in. You can't move in. Spalling is in progress You must evacuate immediately. We're not leaving these people behind. Captain. Captain. Captain. The gondola. Yoon-hee. It's dangerous. There is a gondola outside the window. Stay here, baby. Yoon-hee! We must all get in the gondola. We gotta make the jump. Are you okay? I can't. Come on. No, I can't. It's nothing You can do it. Trust me. You can do this. - Come on. - Jump, Mrs. Jeong. There is no time. Come on. One, two, three! Are you alright, Mrs. Jeong? Hold on tight. What do you think you're doing? This won't hold our weight We must get back inside. In-geon! Ha-na, hang on tight. One. Two. - Three! -jump! Come on. You gotta get up. Jump! No. Here. Over here. Sergeant Oh. Please. Over here. Help me. I know I won't make it out. I just hoped somebody would find me. Can you pass this to my kids? That's all I want. Thank you so much. This will... help ease the pain. I really wanted to see Santa. It's Christmas eve, isn't it? I thought you said there was no Santa. Yes, there is. It's my dad. That's wonderful Your own private Santa. In-geon. Dae-ho. What are you trying to do? A few floors up we can get to the other tower through the sky bridge. What the hell is this? Shit, there is no air. I really gotta find another job. Man, this is no way to make a living. Where do I go from here? Hear our prayers. Send us your angel to get us through these pillars of fire. Send us your angel, Lord. We believe in you, Father Almighty. Send us your angel. Send us your angel. - Your angel. - Your angel, Lord. Send us your angel. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hal... lelujah? Amen Amen Amen Sergeant. Byeong-man. Sergeant Oh. Sergeant. Sergeant. Captain. Wait. No! Stop. You gotta turn back. Captain. If you all move at once the bridge could collapse. What? Come on. Hurry. Be careful. Wait here. Step only on the fluorescent material. You must not run. Why don't we start with this brave little lady? Be careful. Hurry up, damn it Come back if you can't make it. Move it. Daddy. - Ha-na. - Ha-na. Go on, baby. It's okay, don't stop. You're doing great Don't look down. Come on. Daddy. Ha-na! Ha-na! Go for it, baby. No, stop! Mr. Cha! No. Ha-na. Daddy. Run. Daddy. Daddy. Ha-na. Fracturing. Move to safety. Ha-na... Ha-na... Probie. Probie. Are you there? This is a simulation of what will happen. Is there any way to stop this? At this point, we must minimize the damage by demolishing the River View Tower. I understand. Evacuate the brigades Dispatch the demolitions team. But, there are still people up there. You wanna burn the city to ashes? How much time do we have? Fracture is spreading to the entire structure. It's hard to estimate at this point. The water reserve tank on 85 is tilting accelerating the collapse. What's the volume of water in the tank? About 800 tons. What if we discharge the water? It could buy us some time. Prepare to move in. You can't. Firefighters cannot enter. It's a restricted area Only a few people have access. Captain, this is an emergency situation. This building will soon collapse. If we want to make it out alive, we must release the water tank in the next 10 minutes. In order to do that, we need your finger print access. Give the man a break. He's going through the hardest moment of his life. There are dozens of kids Ha-na's age in this building. Their parents must be going through the same thing. We're running out of time. If we don't do this now, there'll be a whole lot more grieving fathers like you. Mr. Lee, we need you. Unit 2, report position. Putting out fire on 35. Stand back. Come on. Unit 5, report position. Fire escape on 28. Proceed downstairs. Lord, give us courage and wisdom - to make it through this burning inferno. - Let me pray, Mr. Kim. Rather than courage or wisdom, please give us... a tsunami. Send us a tsunami, Father. God Almighty. Lord, oh Lord. Tsunami. Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. - Hallelujah. Hold on tight. Miss Seo. Blankets! Blankets! Hang in there, baby. Where do we go? How would I know that? Hey, excuse me. Please, help us. Fire! Fire! Over there by the fire escape! Hurry, please. Alright. Let's go. Eagle One! Captain? What's your position, probie? At the heliport, sir. Daddy. Oh God! Baby Are you alright? Are you hurt? I'm okay, dad. You gotta get here, too. Daddy will get there soon. Bring Yoon-hee with you. Yes, baby I'll bring her with me. Let's hurry. We can't send anymore helicopters up because of the smoke. This is the last one. What about Congressman Park? He'll be on this lift. Keep me posted on his rescue status. Yes, sir. Keep order, please. That's it. No more. Are there children? Here, sir. Get in. Hold tight until you land, okay? Get in, probie. Am I going down, too? Will you get the kid down on her own? I'll stay behind with you. Probie, you said you wanted to be a good firefighter. Pull up. This is the last helicopter. We're saved. Sergeant. Sergeant. Sergeant. Sir! Excuse me. When will the help arrive for us? Any minute now. Byeong-man. Captain. - Are you okay? - I'm good, sir. Ha-na made it to safety. Thank God. Step aside. Water. Paramedic. We managed to buy some time but not for long. Send in the demolitions unit and order crew to evacuate. Captain. I'm here. The demolitions unit is moving in. You gotta get out of there now. Roger that. Didn't you extinguish the fire? Emptying the water reserve bought us a few minutes That's all. Is there really no way? Split into two groups We're running out of time. - Unit 5! Come with me. - Yes, sir. - Unit 5, C-4 installation complete - Unit 3, installation complete. You're suggesting we go down through here? To be precise, we will be falling down At every 10-floor interval, an emergency brake system is in place to prevent accidental fall. Heat fracturing is bringing down concrete walls. The brake system can't be working in this condition. Even if it works, there's still a problem. What if we get stuck in the fire? So... we either fall to our death or burn to death? God Almighty. Oh Lord. Oh Lord. The emergency brake is probably damaged by fire we'll pass through the fire at high speed. If the brakes work once somewhere between the 10th and 20th, we could make it. River View tower is leaning 4.5 degrees toward City View. We must demolish River View within 40 minutes. Will it actually stop at 20? Come on. Stay close to the walls. Mr. Kim. Hallelujah... Here we go. Stand back. Gotta get this thing moving. Jump! Everyone, jump. jump. Break it! Break! Jump! Damn it. It's working. Why isn't it stopping? It worked. Get the pregnant lady first. Yoon-hee! Grab my hand. - Dae-ho... It's okay. - No, Yoon-hee. Yoon-hee, hurry. No! Get out. Yoon-hee! No! Yoon-hee! No! Pull yourself together. Yoon-hee! Chief, Captain Kang escaped. Come with me. An emergency evacuation order was issued in the surrounding areas. Only the rescue teams, military and. police are staying behind. Tower Sky is expected to collapse in a few moments. Ha-na! Ha-na! Daddy. Ha-na. Ha-na. Ha-na. Mr. Kim. Please. Somebody please help. Stay with us, Mr. Kim. Mr. Kim. I thought I would make it out. Mr. Kim. Hallelujah... Amen Unit 1, come in. We're running out of air. Captain, please come in. Will you please respond? You don't have to come to the rescue just answer me. Don't go, dad. Yoon-hee is still down there. If it wasn't for her, you and I couldn't have made it out. Damage in the basement level is so severe that the only way out is through the sewer connected to river. But the distance to the river is quite far. We'll never reach it in time. Where are we at? Near the rain water reserve tank. We'll blow up the tank. If we blow it up, a gush of water will pass through the sewer. And we'll ride the current all the way to the river. This is the remote control detonator. We'll blast the tower in exactly 20 minutes. When you get out, there 'll be a rescue team waiting for you. Let's go. You told me to stay within 3 steps. Yoon-hee! Yoon-hee! - Sergeant Oh. - Yoon-hee. - Sergeant Oh. - Yoon-hee. Captain. Over here. Over here. Wait. Run. - Yoon-hee! Yoon-hee! - Byeong-man. Byeong-man. Captain. Byeong-man. Byeong-man. Get the hell out of here. Captain! Captain is here. Dae-ho. - Sergeant! - We gotta move fast. Yoon-hee. Dae-ho. Are you alright? Dae-ho. Yoon-hee. Hold my hand. Yoon-hee. I'll be right behind you. Go down to 3-12 and wait for my signal. What about you? I'll join you as soon as I set up the explosive. It's done! Come on. What are you doing? Go. We're running out of time. What are you talking about? Hurry. I have to stay and detonate the bomb. What? The remote is gone. No! Open the gate. Open it. Come on, they're waiting for you. You should hurry. No, Captain! I'll stay. Lee Seon-woo, I'm not doing this to save you. This is for all the people you'll save in the future. But, sir... Don't you forget that. Captain. Captain. Mr. Lee. Thank you for everything. Captain. Captain. I've never left a voice message. I'm not sure if I'm doing it right. Can you hear me? It's me, honey. All I've ever done was put you through agony. Honey, I'm sorry for everything. Thank you and I love you. My dear wife, Park Jeong-im. Where is the Captain? Why are you crying? Where is he? Where is the Captain, damn it? Captain. Copy. We're here. Roger that. Captain. Captain. Detonate. At 7 sharp! Reserved for the firefighter I am looking for my dad... SUL KYUNG-GU, SON YE-JIN, KIM SANG-KYUNG DIRECTED BY KIM JI-HOON
