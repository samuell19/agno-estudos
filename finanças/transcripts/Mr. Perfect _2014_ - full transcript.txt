"MR. PERFECT" "Genius Golfer, Baek Se-Jin won the 2008 Korea Open!" "Mr. Perfect, Baek Se-Jin Pro-golfer" "sweeps all the major matches of 2009!" "Baek has a style of his own costume" "Mr. Perfect, Baek Se-Jin" "Winningest golfer of 2009!" Darn! You know I hate kids! What the heck is this? I'm so tired after the game. You know our sponsor already scheduled this a month ago. There was nothing I can do about it. So? How did you get to be a manager? You have to understand the state of your athlete. Your job is to turn down those offers. Anyway, I am heading back to Seoul after this event, so book the flight. No, you can't. There is also a dinner party. Are you kidding me? Kids in the noon and old people in the evening? Book the flight before I go crazy! Why aren't you answering me back? Okay. Fine... Excuse me... Congratulation on your winning, Se-Jin! Se-Jin, how are you feeling? Is there anything you want to say? Thanks to the fans who supported me. I will always do my best. Thank you... excuse me. "Mr. Perfect, Baek Se-Jin in slump..." "Baek Se-Jin Pro fell headlong down to the rank 46th" "Baek's 5th scandal with a model..." "2 Years Later" Golf is not a sport to win over other players, but to overcome your own obstacles. Bullcrap. What? You idiot! Do you remember about the match today? It's with Chief Editor Park! Whatever. Who care if he is the chief editor or not? Do I really have to go? Gosh. What a shame. Don't you understand? It's a special feature article with Kang Tae-woong. Special feature! Get over here right now! Okay... Take right at that gas station. Just come straight about 3.5km. Yes... you are almost here. Just hold on a second. He will be here soon. Chief, Se-Jin hasn't changed at all. Let's just forget the match today. Mr. Choi. I give up. Chief, you know Se-Jin is not like this. He is coming from the practice right now. Let me go! Chief, please give us one more chance! Chief! "Young-min" "Young-min" Girls, get out. What the heck are you doing? Bring me some more alcohols. Get out! Sit! Get out! Sit! Pull this scumbag out. Scumbag? Se-Jin... Long time no see. I will take care of this mess, and pay for all of these. Se-Jin... Get out, you are drunk! Don't start the car! Did you just curse at me? Get out of the car! Who the heck are you ordering to? You know who I am? I am Baek Se-Jin! I know who you are. You are Mr. Perfect, Baek Se-Jin! But, look at you now! Do you think you can win Kang Tae-woong? Don't flatter yourself! I know you didn't show up to the match because you are scared of Tae-woong! Stop the car, Se-Jin! Se-Jin! Stop the car! "1 Year Later" Hurry up! I won't go out! Get off, you jerk! You are finally here. Hey, where did you catch him? I can't tell you I caught him at Mang's Cafe's Miss Kim's house. What? Miss Kim from Mang's Cafe? What the heck are we doing because of this jerk? Let's just call the police. Get your head straight... Let's go! Please help me! Let me go! What the heck. Wait! You little brat! Come here right now! You're here. Welcome! Who is he? I wonder too. I don't know. Are you going to drink with us? Our teacher is not coming back from his thanksgiving break. If we don't find anyone soon, we have to close down the school. Even though it's a physical education degree, I know you received a teaching license at college. It's an elementary school, so it will be fine. There is no boat that goes out to the city today. The one that you saw was the last one that went out. Think about it until tomorrow morning. Just sleep well tonight. Welcome, teacher! What are you guys doing? Greet him! It's really nice to see you... Give him some space. Say hi to the villagers. They are very nice. Hey teacher, I am not sure what is specialized school. What specialized subject do you teach? English? Mathematics? Science? What is that? Science. He can't speak. What did you just say? He is a gym teacher. He doesn't have to speak. Is he deaf? No, he is not deaf. He just lost his voice... Se-Jin! Hey! Such a nice environment to study. Principal always gets drunk and the teacher doesn't even know how to speak. This place is ruined. Should we let the dummy have a try? Stop talking nonsense! I won't let him stay. Be quiet everyone! Sit! You be quiet! Whatever happened, it's happened. Let's not blame anyone. Let's just discuss what we are going to do. We don't even have to discuss about this! I cannot let him teach my son! How can he teach when he doesn't even speak? So? What are you going to do after you kick him out? Why don't you come to your senses? We are about to close our school. Then, do you have any other plan with that mute? Then, I guess you guys are perfectly fine with closing down the school? No, the school should not be closed down. Sure... Of course not! Sure! That's correct! Principal, do you have any other plans? Listen to me carefully. Do you know there is a tiny village called Byungchon Village in Kangwondo? The small school in that village is so crazy right now. The school has turned into a short track speed skating specialized school, and it's getting really famous! What the heck is short track speed skating? You don't know what is speed skating? Remember Anton Ono? Oh! That jerk! Yes, that jerk! Currently, the school is getting bigger and bigger because the kids are going back to suburb to learn that speed skating! So! What does that have to do with our school? What's wrong with him? Slow down your voice. What's he taking? Vitamin... Oh my God! I knew it! He has such a hot body! I want to see him too! Now I see why the men wanted to kick him out. He has a good look. The second Park Se-ri and Choi Kyung-joo can be created from our village! Who cares if the teacher is a mute? Golf doesn't need much word. I am perfectly fine with our new teacher! Why are you changing your decision? You have no principles! So, what should we do from now on? What do you think? I bet he will stay here for only three days. What are you talking about? Stupid. I'm saying, he will leave after three days. I heard he doesn't even speak. Even though he tries to stay here, our parents will kick him out in three days. This is the only answer I got by just looking at this situation. Three days? He will run away tomorrow morning when he wakes up. You think so? Stop the car, Se-Jin! Se-Jin! Se-Jin, are you awake? Did he go out? He was just here. There're two paths. Two paths. He will come from here? In the opposite direction. Across the way. But he not out from there. This way? Not over there! The other way! Who do you think you are talking to? Do you want to die? Look... Do you know how important is to take care of the fishing net for us? Just take the other way! Take the other way. Why the heck is he there? Tell him to get away! Please give me some more drinks! Hey, aunt! This is troublesome. I don't know, I'm scare! Then you go! I'm scared too! Chickens! Even guys are more frightened than me. Hey, what are you guys doing? Please take Byung-joo's father to his house. No way. Where does she come from? Hey, Se-Jin! Are you heading to work? (Dock) I like to call you Se-Jin, not Mr. Baek. I feel like your girlfriend. (Dock) Oh! I get you! Hop on! I will take you there! "Time Table of the Ship" What are you checking that for? Line up! I have something urgent. Please line up. Everyone line up! Where is everyone going without me? "Sold out" I want a ticket too! Give me the ticket! Jung-hwan, take me! Take me too! What the heck are they doing? Whoever wants to leave will leave. It's a waste of time. Mission complete! Let's go home. Let's go. Wait! Get in! Get in again! What do we do now if he stays there? Start the boat. What? The boat is moving, it's moving! Are we really leaving? Hey, captain! You promised me it will only take few minutes! Shut up! We are only faking it! Understand? If you are in that hurry, dive in! We are all from island, so why not? What? Are you serious? Every tiger has his day! Tiger? What the heck are you talking about? Gosh, why bother with it? Are you Mr. Baek, the new teacher from Seoul? What a charming teacher. Hey, who said he is our new teacher? He is not a teacher. He is Mr. Perfect. You just have to follow me from now on. Since we are out, we will have a field trip today. Okay, Mr. Perfect! Hello, everyone. Hello, everyone... How are you doing? She is so bright. "Why did you leave me after all the love that you gave me?" "I hate you but I can't stop loving you" Welcome. Oh my God. Se-Jin. You look very serious. What happened? Anyways, look at your hands. Your hands are so soft. Anna! Get away from him! Do you also like city boys just like other girls? What now? I'll show you who is the boss. Who the heck... Dad. Where are you going? Se-Jin... You idiot! Do whatever you want to do. If you want to leave, then leave. Should we show him this? What if he hates it? He is right. We are not even done with it. But, we can't just let him go like this. Mr. Perfect! Hold on a second! We made this for you. Our principal told us that you love golf more than anything. But, we couldn't offer the real golf club. We couldn't also make a golf ball. Can it be replaced with this? Mr. Perfect, please don't go... Consider my offer one more time. You are not obligated to teach anything to the children. They just need a person who would stay with them. Everyone left without looking back. I believe you will understand the kids better than anyone else. I am leaving. I told you to not to expect anything from him. I really thought he wouldn't leave this time. It's Mr. Perfect! Look at that! It's really Mr. Perfect! Mr. Perfect... What are you guys doing? This is not the first time. Let's go work! Let's go. Why did you leave me after all the love that you gave me? Mr. Perfect... Didn't you say he is Mr. Perfect? Why is he writing Baek Se-Jin? Stupid! Go back to sleep! Understand? Mr. Perfect, have you eaten? Where are you going? The fish is fresh. Why don't we have a drink? It's time for dinner. This is Mr. Perfect! Mr. Perfect! Hello, Mr. Perfect. Nice to meet you. Hello, teacher! Take a look. Buy and eat anything you want. Are you Myung-gyun's friend? It's me! I heard Seoul is very cold. Can you even play golf? We are learning from a professional golfer. He is asking about our scores. Plenty is better. So tell him 180! Does that mean we are good? Our score is about 180 to 190. That's your score? Our instructor is here, so I will talk to you later! Come sit here. Isn't it difficult to teach kids? What the heck are you saying? No, come sit here. Take a drink... Please take care of my Jong-hee. She grabbed a pickax on his first birthday, so she will learn fast! My son, Eun-suk is very smart. He will learn faster. Right, genius? No, golf is about power! Strength! What the heck are you saying? The most important thing in golf is your hips! Jong-hee has a nice butt like Park Se-ri! Am I correct? No... it's about your calf! You see! It's about the power! A nice butt doesn't matter? No. I sit... What is he saying? Do you guys understand what he is trying to say? No. He said he is not here to teach us golf. Then, what does a golf professional teach? He is only here temporarily. Temporarily? We don't need a mute teacher for our kids. We need a golf professional for our kids! A golf professional! (Golf is not that easy to learn.) He said golf is not for everyone to play. Come over here. My rice... What is he trying say? Golf is... not an easy... sport to learn... You are worrying about nothing. Was Park Se-ri born to be a golfer? Our children can learn step by step. Don't you guys agree? Yes, I agree! The surrounding environment is very important. Also, it needs a lot of supports from the parents. Are you saying we are not fit into play golf because we are from a small island? (Not everyone who plays golf become a professional golfer.) He said kids like us can't become professionals. What the heck did you say? You jerk! We tried to accept you as a teacher because you can teach golf to our children. But what? Temporary? Hey! What are you doing? Let Se-Jin go! You stay out of this! Anna, you heard what this jerk just said! He didn't say anything! I didn't hear a word from him! Let's just talk! Let him go! Se-Jin? What happened? What are you doing to our teacher? What the heck do you think you are doing? Stop staring at me. I understand how difficult it is to teach with your health right now. I get what you are trying to say. But, you do know our situation. If you were in my shoes right now, you will want to do everything you can to save this school. Se-Jin. Se-Jin. Everything in this school was created by me. This school is everything to me. I will die if the school is closes down! Se-Jin. There will be a regional junior golf tournament in few months. And, we just have to pass the cut off. Then, our school will be safe! I totally understand how difficult it is to pass the cut off. But, we have you Mr. Perfect as the trainer! I know you can make things happen! Do you really want me to die? Fine! Whatever! We don't need a jerk like you! I was being a total idiot asking for your help! Go home! Get out of our island tomorrow! Jerk! Please help me. Stop playing around. This is not even a real golf club. If I were a rich, I will buy a pretty doll. If I were an adult, I will get married. If I were the president, I will stop people from drinking. Cup noodle sounds so delicious. The previous teachers believe that Lee-hwa distracted us, so they didn't let her come into the class. Why did you say that? We can all study together! (This is real.) If we can't do well this time, the school will be closed. You know that, right? Don't worry about it, sir. Why didn't you just retire? Why did you come all the way here? It's even hard for us to visit here every time. How can our children go out and study when it's even difficult for you to visit us once a semester? I guess you know that very well. Are the students learning English through lyrics? Yes. Our students love to learn English by songs. Mr. Baek is fluent in English. He has been traveling to many different countries. I see. His handwriting is not that great. Today, we will learn how to sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. Yes... Huh? Isn't he from Seoul? Yes, he is. He has a lot of accents. Who? His parents are from Tongyoung. That's why. However, he is fluent in English. Okay, let's read together. Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are This means a twinkle twinkle little star, I really want to know who you are. He will sound better when he sings. Repeat after me. Twinkle twinkle little star How I wonder what you are Why don't we go get some hot tea? Wait a second. This is so weird. His lip and the song are not matching at all. Twinkle twinkle... Nice to meet you. Oh my God, you idiot! You couldn't even do that! Hey... Why are you hitting my precious son? What does it matter when the school is closing down? I knew since the beginning when this mute became a teacher. Shut up! So, what's now? It's all my fault. I will retire. Nothing will be solved anyways! The school is still closing down! You should take the responsibility for this! Who agrees with me? Of course he should! "I apologize for the used ones!" "Kyung-soon's..." Mr. Perfect! Oh my! It's hot! Who is that? Is it too big? Hold my hand. Do you like it? Give me a kiss then. Gosh, they are kissing. Run! Stop... Hey, come here. Come here! Don't you get it after see our style? We are not here to get you today. Seriously? Guide us! To where? Look carefully. What the heck? Give me the club. I will try it. Don't make fun of yourself. Did you see that? What's going on here? Nice shot... Many fishermen play golf in these days. We are not fishers. If so, fish farming? I said no! How much does it cost to install this system? The full set is about 30 million won. No way! 30 million won? Just follow me. Why are you so curious? After that corner, you will see. We're here... Mr. Perfect. We prepared this for you. There is one more thing! This is the famous screen golf! Everyone plays it in these days. You don't have to say thank you. We know. This is beautiful. Daddy? What the heck is that? It's a golf club. I am learning golf in school. Daddy, give me back the club! Golf? There is no teacher in your school! Dad! Give it back! The club is not mine. Did you just yell at your father? Get your hand off me! Dad... What? Are you going to leave me after your become a professional? Like how your mom abandoned us? No way! I won't let you do that! If you were born in the island, you'll have to in live the island. Darn golf! Go get some more drinks! What are you looking at? I told you to go out and get more drinks! It's nothing. I fell from breakwater. Let go of me! Don't let him see the alcohol... Let's drink together. Kyung-ho, you are already drunk. Go home and get some rest. Don't leave me out. I am also from this village. Let's drink together. What's your problem every time you get drunk? Let me go! I don't want to go in! What's wrong? Who hit you? Who the heck are you? What? Are you trying to act like a teacher or something? Dad, stop it! Move! Who do you think you are? Who do you think you are, jerk? Dad! I told you my dad didn't hit me! Why are you beating my dad? Don't talk to your teacher like that! I don't have to play golf. I don't care if the school closes down or not. I just hope I can live happily with my dad. You are just a teacher. You don't have any right to hit my dad. Bullcrap. I will go to another place to drink. Move aside! Dad! Moron, I know your dad's health is important. But do you know how much he owes me? Get out! I won't give you. Just go! Just this once! He is going to sleep anyway. I'm sick of hearing this word after these few years! Just leave! One last time, please! Leave! It's irritating! You're so annoying! Let go! Let me go. Where is my drink? What are you doing? Are you joking with me? Oh yeah? Bring it on. One shot. Cool. Come on! I didn't realize that golf is so much fun. However, if my dad doesn't want me to play, then I will not play. Because I love my dad no matter what. Baek Se-Jin is now in the island? Do you know him? Of course I do! He wasn't that famous as Park Se-ri and Choi Kyung-joo, but he was all over the news as a genius golfer! Baek Se-Jin... Do you also recognize him? I hang out with him in these days. Come home, I will introduce you to him. Wasn't he the one who drunk drove and killed his manager? What are you talking about? He couldn't even drink. Whatever. I just wish our school wins the title. I don't want our school to close. We all know that the school is very special to us. Let's toast to the victory of our kids and the revival of our school! How are our students doing? The tournament is coming soon. I knew from the beginning that it will be difficult. Golf is not a kid's stuff. I don't want you to feel pressure. But, can we still try to enter the tournament? Let's enter the regional! Where are we going to get that money from? I know. I don't want to disappoint our children. How about we only send Byung-joo to the tournament? What the heck are you talking about? What about Jong-hee? It's not fair if only Byung-joo enters the tournament. If we decide to give up on the tournament, we all should not play. That's right. Eun-suk and Hong-man are in fourth grade. Eun-ji is in first grade. Jung-ok has four more years of school. Also, Jong-hee's sister will be enrolling in school next year? But, what if our school closes down? Then, where do those kids go? Let's try it! Why don't we do what he said? It will be great for all of the students to enter the tournament, but think about the reality. I guess we can support Byung-joo. I agree! That's what I am actually talking about. If we can save the school, then we should send Byung-joo out! These people... We won't know whether he will win or not until the day of the tournament. So, we should support him best as we can. You liar! Do you think we are that stupid? Say it! What's going on? What are you doing? Dad, let me go. This jerk! Say something, you scumbag! What the heck are you saying? Stop! This moron. He killed a man! Have a look on this. It's on news. "Golf player, Baek Se-Jin drunk drive and killed his passenger" It's not a direct intention crime. But still, somebody was killed. Hey... Aren't you ashamed of yourself? How can you just sitting there? Let's ask him what happened. Teacher Baek. Mr. Perfect. Is it true? Explain it to us. Yes, everything is true. However, he lost his voice and his dream after that accident. I believe he paid for what he did. That's what you think. How can we let a murderer to teach our children? What if other people find out? They will hurt our children! Seok-goo! We don't need to hear from you! If you can't talk, then write it down! Explain it to us right now! What a great duo! A mute teacher and an alcoholic principal! I guess we expected too much from him. We rely on you since we couldn't afford to send the children out to the city. I thought you were different than the other teachers who left us. This is not right. Why did you make the kids to dream and make us to hope for something? Were we that easy? School or whatever. We don't need you guys anymore. Sorry. We will leave. But, I really want you guys to know this before I go. When I looked at Se-Jin and the children, do you know what I realized? I realized that Se-jin's eyes were filled with the children. And, we all know that those eyes are the best eyes for the teachers. Not all teachers can have those eyes. But, Se-Jin. Se-Jin has that eyes. Shut up! Get them out of here! How can you guys do this to a teacher? Seok-goo, you... Where do you think you are going? Please stop it. Please don't kick them out. Please don't kick Mr. Perfect out... Listen to me carefully. Mr. Perfect is not your teacher from now on. Yes, he is. He is our teacher. He is our teacher. These brat! It's none of your business! Move! We won't move! He is our teacher, not yours! Why don't you ask our opinions, and just try to drive him out! We won't let him go like this! We won't let him go... Line up! Sorry, I really have to go first. "We don't sell tickets to Mr. Perfect" Registered athletes should come to the main office for the group drawing. Repeat. Registered athletes should come to the main office for the group drawing. This is you, right? You must have felt great. Tee shot from Jung Jin-wook! That was a great shot! Yes, it was! Jung Jin-wook won the tournament last year. He is a strong candidate for winning in this year too! Next is Lee Byung-joo. He is from Sanyang Elementary School, which sounds unfamiliar. Right. He looks very nervous. I mean everyone does on their first tournament. Yeah. His shoulder stiffened. And he looks rather nervous. He is now getting ready for his tee shot. Even his hands is shaking. It's Lee Byung-joo's tee shot. He missed the tee shot. He must be very nervous! He starts off with a penalty. Lee Byung-joo's caddy looks very familiar. Right. Isn't he Mr. Perfect, Baek Se-Jin? I was wondering where he was, but I guess he was teaching students in a suburb. Once again, Byung-joo is getting ready for his tee shot. He putted it! Oh no, it's going to the rough. It's okay... This is Lee Byung-joo's first hole. He started off a penalty, and this is his third shot. Is Lee Byung-joo aiming the putting green? The caddy of course looks very experienced. He is helping Byung-joo with a right direction to the fair way. Yes, his caddy is really reliable. Lee Byung-joo's third shot. His golf reached the fairway successfully. Lee Byung-joo's fourth shot. He tried to putt by fifth shot. But it couldn't go up to the hill. It's coming back down. Will it be possible to putt this successfully about 15m away from the hole cup? I don't think there is a possibility. Even if he does it, it will still be 2 over par. It's better to think this is his first experience, right? Yes. This is his sixth shot. It seems like it's going to the right direction. It went in! "30 - Lee Byung-joo" "24 - Lee Byung-joo" "09 - Lee Byung-joo" "04 - Lee Byung-joo" "05 - Kang Byung-Chan" Did we receive any call? It's here... Hello? Hello, we would like to introduce you a nice land with nice view by the sea for sale. This is the beach. We are in an island already! This is the 485 meter par 5 18th hole. It's Jin-wook's tee shot. It looks very nice as usual. It's Byung-joo's tee shot. Byung-joo is amazing! Even though this is his first time playing at a tournament, he is doing great after each hole. Yes, he is doing really great. Although he was far behind Jin-wook when the tournament started, he made a tie score with Jin-wook at the 17th hole. It's Jin-wook's second shot! He made it close to the green. Byung-joo's second shot. He putted it! Was he too nervous? It went into the rough. Right, it must be very frightening. He is falling apart at the last hole. But, don't be too disappointed. He played it very well today. Byung-joo's third shot. The rough seems very deep. Yes, it's a deep rough. I think he is changing the club. He chose iron than approach... Yes, he picked the 6 iron. This will be the time for the coach to step in. Of course he does. Oh, wait! He is not. He is actually cleaning the club head with something from his pants. It's actually his red underwear. When Se-Jin was a player, his caddy used to clean Se-jin's club head with his red underwear. I didn't expect that from Se-Jin. Will this bring luck to Lee Byung-joo too? "01 - Lee Byung-joo" In! It's an eagle! He shot an eagle! The first eagle of the tournament came out at the last hole of the course. Dad... Dad! I came in as the first place. Dad, I won the tournament. I know, son. You brat, why are you crying? Dad. Don't cry! I am so proud of you. This elm tree was here way before the people started to live here. There is a legend about this tree. If sincere hearts of people in this island gathers and touch to God's mind, its leaves turn red and people who left the island come back. Then we all can live happily ever after. This island is like a mother's womb. It always embraces children when they come back after they were hurt. Isn't this the right place to be born again? Stop looking back. Liar. I thought you were different from others. But I was wrong. You act as you're doing everything for us, but in your heart, you are planning to leave. That's why... That's why I don't like you when you first come here. It should be like this, but... why are you so good to me? Why? Let go! I don't need this. Take it back! Mr. Perfect is leaving... Hey, Byung-joo! Jong-hee! Where are you guys? He is leaving! This is weird. Where is everyone? Lee-hwa, aren't you sad? Nope. I am not sad. He will always be in my heart, so I am not sad at all. All the kids feel the same way. Take care of yourself! Goodbye! I am sorry. I couldn't be with you guys. And thank you. Thank you guys for the support and the unconditional love. Your encouragements made me able to go out to the world again. Guys. Although it was a short time we've been together, I will always have your smiles in my heart. We will see each other soon. I love you guys. Mr. Baek! "Whatever you come back or not!" He left already! Mr. Perfect... Is that him? Is it? Mr. Perfect? Mr. Perfect... Mr. Perfect... Mr. Perfect! We love you... (I love you!) (I love you guys!) Hey guys... I love you guys! Goodbye! Goodbye, Mr. Perfect... Jong-hee! Hong-man! Eun-suk! Eun-ji! Jung-ok! Byung-joo! I love you! Mr. Perfect, goodbye...
