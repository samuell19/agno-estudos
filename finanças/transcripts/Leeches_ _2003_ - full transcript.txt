This is what? Your third one this week? - It's just stress, Casey. You know I've got that meet coming up. - It's not the meet, Jason. It's what you're doing to win it. Those things are messing with your mind, God knows what they're doing to your body. - Hey, you didn't seem to have any problems with my body a few hours ago, now did you? - Yeah, well, I don't think I can take this much longer. I just may start spending my nights back in my room again. - You know what? I don't think Stevo and Sabrina would appreciate the company to tell ya the truth actually, so... - You gotta lay off the steroids, I mean it. This wasn't happening before you started using. - You make it sound like it's crack. And it's not just me, the whole team's taking them. - I really doubt that, Jason. As far as I know it's just Stevo. But I guess as far as you're concerned he is the whole team. - What's that supposed to me? - What's that supposed to mean? - I don't know, man. She's just been on my case about the whole steroids thing. - Can't imagine what she's worried about. I mean, it hasn't affected your performance, has it? - No. But, Stevo, have you had any weird dreams lately? - Only weird and usual. There's this one that I keep havin' though about my mom's doubles partner. - Come on, man. I'm serious. I've been having all these nightmares lately, and she's just been freaking out about it. - All right, look. It's your body getting used to it. Okay, give your system some time to adapt, and you'll be fine. Trust Stevo, okay. - Don't I always? (rock music) Anyone else gonna come in the water? - No. I'll stay out here, thanks. And it's too cold for me. - And there's leeches in the water. - Ew, really. - Yeah, you can't feel 'em, but they latch on and suck out your blood. - Is that true? - I'd already been in the water, okay. Ain't no leeches on me. - Ow ow! (whistling) - Oh yeah. - Yeah, well. He's gonna take you swimming, so come on. - No he's not. No, Tony. - I'm taking you in right now. (laughing) I can't hear ya. Come on. - No. - So Case, are you two gonna join me and Stevo for spring break or not? - We haven't sorted our plans yet. We're having some issues right now. - Well, sell them, Case. You guys have to come with us to camp. - Fish, cut it out, man. Can't you see I'm working here. - Get your mind off marine biology, man. Just come on it. The water's great. - Yeah, I'll wait till practice to get wet. Besides, I have a lab to finish. Some of us are going for more than a 2.0 GPA. - 3.2 right now, I'll have you know. Just because I have a swim scholarship, doesn't mean I can't get ed-jah-muh-cated. - Gotta have something to fall back on after your gold medal, right? - Five gold medals. I'm gonna set a school record. - And all the endorsements, all the money. - You got it. - And, you get to underwrite my... Hey man, turn around. - What? What? Ew. That was on me? - Yeah, don't worry, they can't hurt you. - Still, gross though. Sarah's checking you out again. Better go for that soon, the year's more than half over. - I'm workin' on it. Just taking my time. - What are you waiting for? - Yo guys, coach wants us ready for practice in 10 minutes. - We'll be there. - So I can pay you over the weekend? - Yeah, sure man, I got the stuff in my locker, I'll just give it to you after practice. - I really appreciate it, Stevo. I actually think it's helping. Might make team captain yet. - I don't know, man, you'll have to beat me first. - Think I can't? (rock music) - [Stevo] Told you, man. - [Tony] Gimme time, Stevo. Gimme time. - Yeah, whatever. (dramatic music) Hey man, here you go. - Why didn't you give me these in the locker room? - So many pryin' eyes. - Hey, wait, hold on. - What? - You got like leeches on you, man. - What? Where are they? - Hold still. - Get 'em off me. - Sick. - Oh my. - Check me. - Dude, you got 'em too. - What? - They're even bigger. Ugh. Oh my God. Wanna take a half hour shower. - Yeah, whatever, you tell coach you were late 'cause a little leech. - It wasn't that little. - We got more important things to worry about, all right? Let's focus on the week. Let's kick ass out there, all right, be fit for once. - Come on, you guys, my Mama can swim faster than that, and she's 65. That's it, Stevo, don't let fish come in first all the time. Make him work for it. (rock music) Come on you guys. Make him work for it. - [Robbins] Nice job, man. - Good show, Robbins. I don't know what your secret is, but I wanna see more of it. We'll need that to beat southern state on Friday. You too, nice work. You'll do your family proud yet. And Fish, don't you get lazy on me. I noticed your times have been slippin' lately. - Gotta say I'm impressed. I don't know what you're doin', but... - Wanna know what we're doin'? - Yeah, man, anything that helps. - Meet us in the locker room later. Show you the secret to my success. - All right. (rock music) ♫ What can I say, the world is slippin' away ♫ Yeah ♫ Behind the door, God's keepin' score ♫ Yeah ♫ Into the sun it come undone ♫ Yeah ♫ What can I say - [Coach] All right, next four, take your positions. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) - Hey. Hey Ton', everybody else gone? - See anyone else? All right, so tell me, you know, what's your big secret? - It's not so big, really. It's just... Some magical little pills, that's all. - What? Steroids? - Yeah. It worked for me. - Look, man, I don't use drugs, all right. I saw enough people get messed up on this stuff back home. - They're not drugs, Tony. They're performance enhancers. You're not gonna get addicted or something, you're just gonna... Get addicted to winning if you want. - Yeah. You know I've heard some stories about this things, too, you know, like, don't they like... - What? - Shrink your dick or something? - Can not say I've had that problem, Tony. What about you, Jason? - No. Had no problems at all. - I've been takin' 'em for a while, Tony. It's the secret to our success, and it could be the secret to yours too, right now, right? Trust Stevo, okay. - Any chance you could share your secret with me? - What do you want? - I heard you say you had some secret for doing better. - Why don't you get lost? And frankly, I don't even know why you're on this team. All right, you're not built for it. - I'm on this team because I like to swim. I Just figured you could help me do better. You know, teamwork. - Probably do this team a lot better if you just drop out, okay? Now why don't you go find a book or something and leave us alone. (ominous music) - What's that? Yeah Franklin? - [Franklin] Franklin here. - It's Foster, down here in the men's lockers. Look, we got some kind of leak down here. - [Franklin] What kind of leak? - Well, I don't know what it is. - [Franklin] Is it sticky? - Look, I'm not touching it. I just want it fixed, okay. Right now. - [Franklin] Gotcha. - What do you want? - I stayed in the wait room late. I just wanted to grab a shower. - Make it fast, I'm locking up soon. (dramatic music) (leeches groaning) - Whoa. (groaning) (dramatic music) (groaning) (gentle music) - [Brunette Woman] Coming out with us, later? - I don't know, I still got like 100 pages to read before the break. - You don't have to read that stuff now. Just do like I do. Wait till you get back from break, read it all the night before. - You can read all this in one night? - No, but by then it's too late to do anything about it, right? (knocking) Come on in, it's open. - Hi girls. - Hey Spence, what's up? - [Blonde Woman] Come on in, have a seat. - I was just wondering if you had the reading list for bio. I seemed to have lost mine. - Sure, let me just find it. You all ready for the break. - I guess. I'm not doing anything special, just going home for the week. You still going to Florida? - Yeah, but not Daytona or anything. Just meeting my parents at their summer beach house. - Try Lauderdale, Sarah. Lots of great looking guys this time of year. - Angie. - Telling the truth, I've been there. - Here it is. - Don't you need this? - No, I'll get it from you later. - Okay, thanks. Gotta go I'm afraid. See you later. - Bye. Thanks a lot? - Hey, I'm just trying to make him jealous. Quickest way to a guy's heart. - Not like he didn't notice. - Just playing hard to get. You have to get more aggressive. - What, like jump on his lap and stick my tongue down his throat? - Works for me. (ominous music) (retching) (ominous music) (retching) (ominous music) (rock music) - You guys ready? - Hey, where's the girls? - Ah, I don't know. Angela said she needs a couple more minutes to get ready or something. - Well go and get her, man, and tell the rest of them to hurry up. - All right, whatever. - Hey, start that new diet we talked about? - Yeah, and I popped a couple before, why? - Bring the rest of them with you, okay. I need to catch up. - Tonight? - Meet's tomorrow, Tony. Need you as strong as possible. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (leeches groaning) (screaming) - [Woman] Look, I told you I'm still not ready. - Hey babe, you look all right. Come on, everyone's waitin'. - I don't know why you guys gotta be so impatient all the time. (dramatic music) - You shouldn't stay out too late. You guys have to conserve your energy for tomorrow's meet. - I think we'll have all the energy we're gonna need. And leave those damn south state boys in our wake. - Damn skippy. - What's up? - I don't wanna say anything, but, are you okay with what they're doing? - What do you mean? - The stuff they've been taking. - What, pumpers? Yeah, shouldn't I be? - It's just, Jason's been having some problems. - He's probably just getting used to them, that's all. - Well, I'm not getting used to them. - You should, 'cause I could get use to winning tomorrow. - Hey guys. - Hey Fish, where you guys headed? - Bio lab. - Yo man, we're just gonna hang out by the lake. Why don't you come on over with us? - Can't, we got brain work to do. - Hey man, why don't you ditch the study buddy? - Sorry, too much work. Catch you guys tomorrow. - [Stevo] Hey, stay focused, all right. - Sorry about that, bro. Stevo can be a real asshole sometimes. - It's okay, man, I'm used to it. - Besides, I look at it this way. Science will take me farther than swimming will take me. - [Man In White Shirt] Good answers. (rock music) - No, no, don't you dare. No. - Hey everyone, water. - No, if you do, I will kill you. I swear to God. - Stevo, you got a minute? - Yeah, sure. - Look man, I just wanna let you know that after the meet tomorrow, I don't need anymore pills. - What are you talking about? - They make me feel strange. Like I'm not myself. - You're not yourself. All right? You're better. You're a stronger swimmer already, and I've seen that yesterday. - Look, I don't want that kind of help anymore, all right. I can do it on my own. - Jason, look, your father was a medalist. Your grandfather was a medalist. I mean don't you even wanna be a part. - Of course I do. They didn't need steroids, and neither do I. - That's Casey talking. She talked you into this. - [Brown-Haired Man] Casey, Christ Stevo. - [Stevo] Casey, there are certain things between me and Jason that are just none of your business, okay. - Well, if it's affecting his health, it is my business. - Jason is as healthy as a damn horse. - Really? Shows how well you know him. - I've known him since freshman year. You guys have been going out, what, five months? - So what is that supposed to mean? You got dibs on him or something? - Stevo, why don't you lighten up? - Who's side are you on? - Who's side are you on? - I'm on the team's side. All right, this is for all of us. Just give it a couple of more months. We'll make finals, and then we'll... Whatever, go back to normal, all right. - Yeah, I guess so. Casey, maybe he's right. Just a little bit longer. - I don't believe this. - What? - You're letting him screw up your life. - I'm not letting him do anything. - Right. Well I'll tell you what. I'll let you do whatever you want. I'm out of here. - Good man. And you stand your ground, all right. - [Brunette Man] Hey, where you goin'? - Away from you. - What did I do? - You're all men. - What the hell? - Let her go. Just to time to cool off or something. - I hope this was all worth it, Stevo. - It will be. You trust Stevo, all right? (rock music) Hey Tony, how you doin'? You got the stackers on you or what? - Yeah, why? - Look, I don't think Jason's heart is in this, and I think we're gonna ya to pick up the slack, all right? - What do you mean? - I don't know, I think you should take a whole bunch right now. This is our catch up, you know. - Well, how many? - Whole bag. - Look, I don't know, Stevo. - Tony, they're not gonna hurt you, okay. They're gonna make you feel like a champion, and you're gonna feel like even more of one after we win tomorrow. All right. Hey. Something to wash it down with? - Man, if you say so. - Yeah, I do. Just trust Stevo, okay. (dramatic music) There you go. You're gonna be fine, I promise. - Man, I hope so. - Hey, keep it. Party on, man. (dramatic music) - What the hell? - What happened? - You got me. - What's up? Is this a joke? Did one of the guys do this? - Maybe they melted? - Yeah, right. - I am not touching that. - Do you got something I can click this in? - Girl, you're on your own there. (dramatic music) (rock music) (groaning) (screaming) (screaming) - Are you sure you want to? I heard boxers never do the night before a fight. - This isn't a fight. There's been enough fighting today. - Forget what the others said. You're doing the right thing. You're doing what's best for the team. Now, do what's best for me. (laughing) Where is it? - What? - There's nothing there. (laughing) (screaming) - Morning babe. - Hello. - Look, I gotta get ready, bus is at 10. - I know, just a couple more minutes. (knocking) - All right, just hold that. - Okay. - Hey Ange, what's up? - You seen Tony? - No, not since last night. He's not in his room? - No, his roommate hasn't seem him. Nobody's seen him. - Okay, well, he can't have gone far, all right. He was... He got pretty drunk last night. - What? - He's probably sleeping it off somewhere. - Can you help me look, I'm gettin' worried. - Yeah, yeah, sure, we'll both look. We need him for the meet, so... We'll be out in a couple minutes. - All right, thanks. - Damn it. (ominous music) - Tony. Tony, it's Angela, where are you? - [Coach] What do you mean you can't find him? - Looked everywhere, coach. His car is still here, so he can't have gone far. - Did you guys party last night? He didn't drink anything he shouldn't have, did he? Or take anything? - No sir. - All right, crap, there's no more time. He's gonna the mother of all last beatings when we get back. - [Doctor] Excuse me. Step aside, everyone, please. Has anyone tried CPR? - Yeah, I tired, I couldn't do anything. - Jesus Christ. Does anyone know what happened? - [Young Woman] You saw him last night, right Sabrina? - [Sabrina] Yeah. - [Doctor] How was he? - He was drunk. Pretty drunk. - [Doctor] And you didn't take him home? - He said he wanted to stay out and get some air. - I'll need to talk to you later. I need to know where I can reach this boy's parents. (ominous music) - Angie, I am so sorry. - I don't understand. I mean how... He's gotten drunk before, but he could always take care of himself. How could he have drowned like that? - Well, you saw the cut on his head. He must have fallen and knocked himself out. - I don't think so. He wouldn't get so drunk he couldn't stand. - What are you saying? - I think some of the other guys might have given him something. I mean I know some of them are on steroids. - What? - Yeah, yeah. Stevo's been dealin'. (knocking) - Who is it? - Hey. - Angie, I'm so sorry. - Yeah, thanks. - If there's anything I can do... - I need to talk to the other guys about what happened last night. Do you know when they're gettin' back? - I just saw them pull up. They didn't look happy. - Now, does any of you care to offer, I don't know, an observation, an explanation, an excuse for your pathetic performance back there? And I don't wanna hear how we were down one of our best swimmers. Sure, Tony wasn't there, and I'm not lettin' him off the hook for it. I get the feeling you guys don't like what you're hearing. Well, you know what guys? I don't like what I saw this afternoon, so cancel your little trips to Palm Springs, 'cause we got work to do. - [Doctor] Excuse me, coach. - [Coach] What is it? - I'm sorry to interrupt. I can see it's not a good time. - You got that right. - But I'm afraid I have some bad news. Everyone, I'm terribly sorry to have to break this to you all, but there was an accident last night. Tony LaMarco drowned out at the lake. - [Coach] How did this happen? - I'm not sure. I'm told he was drinking heavily last night. As far as I can tell, he slipped on the dock, fell and hit his head and went into the water unconscious. - I appreciate you telling us, Dr. Manning. - I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news. There wasn't much blood left in the body, but I was able to draw enough to run a couple tests. He tested positive for steroids. - What? - He'd taken a lot, and recently. Now I heard you telling your team to stay here for spring break, I think that'll be an excellent opportunity to have everyone tested. - Listen, just because one of 'em took it... - That is an excellent indication that others are too. - Maybe. But if nobody knows about Tony... - If you're suggesting I falsify my report, number one I won't, and number two, my tests are just preliminary. The parents will no doubt insist on an autopsy. It will come out. - You're really kinda screwing things up for me here, Dr. Manning. - With all due respect coach, we have a bigger issue to deal with than whether your team makes it to the finals. I suggest you impress upon the others not to follow Tony's lead. - Listen up, guys. If any of you are on anything, you're stopping cold turkey as of right now. Thanks to Dr. Manning, you're all being tested at some point in the break, and I want you all clean. - Isn't that unconstitutional? - As far as this team is concerned, this is not a democracy, and I am the president of the united states of your ass, and you don't like it, you're welcome to leave the team. No deserters? Good. Dismissed. - I don't like this, Stevo. How long does it take for this stuff to get out of your system? - We'll be fine. I'll take care of it, all right. - Yeah, like you took care of Tony? - Say that again. - You gave him steroids yesterday, and now a day later he's dead. - Pills didn't kill him, little man. In fact, I recall you really wanting in bad too. Yeah, in fact, the only reason you're not taking 'em, is because I felt the other guys on the team deserved them more. - Cut your crap about the devotion of the team, Stevo. - What's the matter, Fish, you jealous? Worried somebody might be doin' a little bit better than you? - Not worried enough to do something stupid like taking drugs to enhance my performance. You've jeopardized the whole... - You watch it. Watch it. - Roid rage much, Stevo? - Naw. - Come on Spence, he don't have authority about anything anymore. (ominous music) (chirping) (ominous music) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (screaming) - Sarah, hi. - Hey Spence. I'm not interrupting anything, am I? - No, just making my last check before the break. Although, under the circumstances. - Yeah, I heard, I'm sorry. - Don't know why me and fish have to stay. We went out four times, and we weren't taking pumpers. - Did you tell the coach that? - He's in no mood to listen, trust me. So I'm stuck here for the week. Maybe I can get a jump on the next lab assignment. - I'm sticking around too. - I thought you were going to Florida. - Yeah, unfortunately I got in a fight with my parents. Besides, you know, I figure Angela could use some moral support. - But why isn't she leaving? - She was supposed to go away with Tony. - I feel so bad for her. After a loss like that. - Hey, can I ask you something? - [Spencer] What's that? - I don't know. It was all over Angela's aquarium. Got back to the room the other day, and all the fish were gone, and that stuff was all over it. - Just gone? - Mm-Hmm. Yeah, I mean, maybe it was a prank, but, I don't think so. - There's nothing leaking in the room, was there? - No. - No sign of fish anywhere? - Nope. - Well, it's definitely organic. I mean, if you want I can run some tests. - Yeah, that would be great. I'd really like to know what that stuff is. - There's nothing wrong with an inquisitive mind. Listen, I'm just finishing up here. Once I'm done, you wanna go out somewhere? Get a bite to eat? - You're still hungry? - Hey, we're scientists. Can't let something like this spoil our appetite. Besides, it's not as gross as the dorm food. - Okay, sure. It'll be nice to get off campus for a little while. - All right, well, let me wash up. - So are you going to the party? - What party? - They're having a little party at the pool. Kind of a memorial for Tony. Thought they would have told you about that. - Yeah, well, Stevo and I are not on the best terms right now. And besides, I prefer the present company. (dramatic music) - [Stevo] To Tony. - [All] To Tony. - All right, everybody, listen up. I know that some of you guys are talking about what happened to Tony, and I wanna admit right now, that I gave him some gear last night. But that did not kill him. I would never have done anything to hurt Tony, and you all know that. What happened was an accident. It was a really terrible accident, but I loved Tony, and I'm sure gonna miss the guy. Anyway, I know some of you guys are talking about drug tests, and I'm concerned too, but I'm gonna do my best to make sure that that does not happen. So in the meantime, those of us who were taking them have to stop. - For good? - For now. In any case they decide to search our rooms, those of us who have them need to go and get rid of them. Right now. - What, miss the party? - We're still gonna be here when you get back, just go get rid of them, flush them or whatever, and come back here. We'll get more when this heat dies down. - Yeah, whatever. - So what if they decide to test us again later? - I'll take care of it later. - It's not worth it, Stevo. I mean it's bad enough these things are messing with my head. Now they might get me kicked off the team, possibly even out of school. You kidding? No, man, I'm done. - That would be a mistake, Jason. We need these things and you know it. - No, I don't think so. - Why don't you think about what you're doin', Jason? What you're not doin'. You were slipping and I saved your ass. You know if your performance doesn't measure up, you might be a part of this team next year. - You're threatening me now? Screw you, man. Case, you wanna bail? This party's got a lot less fun. - Sure. You wanna go? - Yeah. Can't say I'm really in the mood to celebrate. (ominous music) (ominous music) (screaming) - [Blonde Woman] Are you sure you'll be okay? - Yeah. I just wanna grab a couple of Tony's things. Stuff to remember him by. - Listen if you need us... - You know, I think I am gonna leave tonight. There's no reason for me to stay. - Yeah, you shouldn't be alone. - It's too depressing staying here. I miss him too much. - You take care of yourself, okay. Call me when you get home. - Yeah, I will. He gave me his dorm key. That's love. (dramatic music) - Thanks. - So everything's cool now, right? - Soon as the boys ditch their gym king, we'll be all very cool. - How about yours? - What about mine? - You've got the main stash. They could search your room too. In fact, that's probably where they'd look first. - Yeah, they won't search your room though. - Oh, I see, I'm supposed to hide your evidence. - It's already hidden. - In my room? - Don't worry about it. It's not like you're gonna find it or something. - Jesus, Stevo. When were you gonna tell me about this? - I just did. Don't worry about it, you're not gonna get in any trouble. Okay, just... Trust Stevo, okay. - It's not that. You should have told me first. I would have said yes. - I'm sorry. Make it up to you later? - Sure. - [Man] All gone. - Good for you. - I'm sorry about yesterday. I should have stuck to my guns and told Stevo off right then. - You told him off tonight. I'm proud of you. - I mean it's just hard you know, he's like my best friend here. - And you know what, if he lets this interfere with your friendship, he wasn't your friend in the first place. Enough about him, and more about us. Remember that little scenario you were interested in trying? - Yeah. - I think I'd like to try that now. - Oh, excellent. (ominous music) (groaning) (screaming) - You okay so far? - Okay so far. Still think you're wearing too much. - Really? - [Man] Uh-huh. - Well, all right. (rock music) - That's more like it. Oh man. What? Hey, what the... - You're not the only one with an imagination. - All right. What are you doin'? - Just getting supplies ready. - Okay. - Uh-Oh. - What? - The Trojan horse is empty. - [Man] Oh jeez. - Where does Stevo keep his? - He don't even use 'em. - Figures. I'll be right back. - Where you goin'? - Don't go away. (laughing) Cassie? You tease, you never even left the room, did you? (laughing) (rock music) What are you doing? What is that? Cassie. Cut it out, that hurts. Ah. Casey. (screaming) - [Robbins] Yeah, it's all taken care of. - [Coach] All right, you better make sure, and get rid of yours too. - [Robbins] It's done, it's hidden pretty well. - I don't want 'em hidden, Robbins. Dispose of 'em. - I don't know, Coach, that's a lot of money. Do you think you can replace 'em later? - What for free? Not likely. But you're a rich boy. You should be able to afford a new supply. - Coach, it doesn't seem very fair to me. - Don't you tell me what fair is, your family makes more in a week than I do in a year, so you can damn well afford to pay me for more. It's not my fault Tony went and got himself killed. - It was an accident. - I don't give a damn. Look, you're gonna dump that stuff, and you're gonna dump that stuff pronto, and I'm gonna do my best to make sure those drug tests never happen, and that's what I'm gonna do for you. Then when I feel it's safe again, I'll start supplying you again, and you'll start paying me again, and that's what you'll do for me. Got it? - Yeah, I got it. - Good. Go on enjoy your party. - Jason, I got some. Jason? (ominous music) What happened? (gasping) Oh God, Jason, what happened? Wake up. Please wake up. (screaming) - I really hope this doesn't mean goodnight. - Why, did you have something else in mind? - Nothing specific, I'd just rather not leave you right now. - Ah. Well, we could go to the party, get some free drinks. - Don't you have anything back in your room? - Okay then. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) What's going on? - I don't know. - Angela. No! Angela. - Don't touch her, don't touch her. - [Blonde Woman] What did this? What did this to her? - Looks like the same stuff you found in your room. - Oh my God. She can't be dead. No, no, she can't be dead. I gotta get out of here. - We gotta find Fish first. - Fish? - I wanna make sure he's safe. - Okay, you go find him, I'll meet you outside. - No way, we're not splitting up. I'm not letting you out of my sight, let's go. (sobbing) (ominous music) (ominous music) (groaning) (rock music) (groaning) (screaming) (screaming) - Oh my God, those things killed him too. (dramatic music) (electricity buzzing) (dramatic music) They're all dead. - Looks like it. There might be some more of 'em out there. We can't leave him here. - No, no no no. We have got to get out of here before there's another invasion of those bloodsuckers. No no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. - [Man] What? - [Woman] Shouldn't we warn everyone else? - [Man] We don't even know where they all are. - All right, look, we'll go and send for help, but we have to be safe. - [Man] All right, get in my car. - [Woman] Okay. Oh my. Maybe not. (ominous music) - [Man] Thank you, Coach. - [Woman] This is his car? - [Man] Yeah. Look for a key. - [Woman] Nothing. - [Man] Damn it, nothing. - [Woman] You don't know how to hot wire a car, do ya? - No. You? - [Woman] Hey, what are you doing? - Popping the trunk, we can't stay here all night. Maybe he's got something we can use as a weapon. Careful. - Oh God. - Jesus. Dr. Manning. He killed her. Why? - What? - She was gonna have us tested, the whole team. Coach couldn't have that? - That's insane. - No more insane than anything else that's going on here. - So what do we do now? - Only thing we can do. Run for it. - What, on foot? It's like 10 miles to town. - Well we can't stay here. Maybe if we get off campus we can flag someone. - Hey. What are you doin' here? - [Woman] Stevo! Run, get off the campus. Now! - Well, what the hell's going on. - [Woman] Just go! Run! (groaning) - What the hell was that? - A leech. - That was no damn leech. Man, they don't get that big. - Well, I haven't exactly had time to study them. - Them? You mean there's more than one that size? - It's my educated guess, that they're the result of your little steroid program. - That's bull. - From what I heard, Tony was full of stuff the night he died. And Dr. Manning said he was covered in leech bites. Not to mention anyone of you guys they might have been feeding on in the lake. - Steroids are just drugs, man. I don't see how they can possibly... - They're animal proteins. If they can pump up somebody to your size, then imagine what they can do to something that small. Something that's been feeding on you guys for who knows how long. And they got a super dose from Tony the other night. - No, I don't believe you, man. I don't see how it's possible that something like that can just grow that big. - Who cares how this happened, okay? The fish is dead, and Angela is dead too, but I don't wanna be next. So we can please... - Sabrina. - What? - She's back at the pool, man. I have to go get her right now. - Come on. - [Man] Where is she? Oh God, where is she? - [Woman] Maybe she got away. - [Man] No, we would have seen her. We gotta find her right now. - [Man 2] There's no time, we have to... - [Man] No, she's alive. I know it. And we're not leaving here until we find her. Coach. Coach. - They were everywhere. Then all of a sudden they were everywhere and I locked myself int he equipment room, and when I came out they were gone. - The leeches, they're gone? - The team, Sabrina. - What happened to Sabrina? - So many bodies, I had to put 'em somewhere until I could figure out what to tell people. - Tell people? No, no. We have to go, we have to go get help. - No, no. Don't you think I know what's going on here? How they got so big? It was the steroids, it's all a mistake. We can't let anyone know about this. - Coach, you're out of your mind. We have to go right now. I have to tell someone. - You're not going anywhere. (groaning) - We can't leave him here. - We won't. Not for long, but we can't have him gettin' in the way. - In the way of what? - I think I know how to stop 'em. - Are you sure? - Yeah, after what happened with Fish... - Sabrina's dead. Everybody's dead. Coach stashed the bodies in the locker. - Oh God. - Did I do that? Is this my fault, or? - No, no no, you couldn't have known. - But you can help us put an end to it. Okay, they need water to live, so I'm fairly certain they've been travelling through the plug. - [Shirtless Man] Yeah, so what? - Well then, this is where we'll lure them. They'll go where there's water, and food. - So what do we do? - Well, we were able to electrocute some before, so we can run some electrical cable into the water, and lure them here, we can... - No, that's nuts. - Look, it'll work. We just have to find a way to get 'em in here. - And how do we do that? - With some live bait. - Yeah. - Ah, hell no. - Look, you're the strongest of the three of us. - And what does that have to do with anything? Oh you gotta be kidding me. - [Shirted Man] Look, you've always been able to swim faster than anybody else. - Yeah, not with the mutant, the leeches coming after me. - Look, it's the only way. We have to get them in here, and keep them in here long enough for us to fry their asses, and you can do that. We trust you, Stevo. - All right, you better not fry my ass too though. (ominous music) - Try another one. Okay, that's the one. Shut it off until I give you the signal. It's all yours. - I'm not sure I want this to happen sooner or later. - It'll be fine. - Yeah. - Oh yeah. Give him some incident. - Right, yeah, sure thing. (dramatic music) (ominous music) - [Man] You ready in there? - Yeah, ready. - You bastard. Steroid monster huh? (rock music) Bet you're just full of the stuff. (groaning) - See anything yet? - No, nothing yet. - Look, man, I just wanted to let you know that I'm really sorry for everything that happened. - Yeah, don't sweat it, man. - Yeah, if it wasn't for me, this... - What's going on? - Oh God, they're coming. All right, little bastards, come on. I told you to get ready man. - [Man] You ready in there? - Ready. (groaning) - All right go. Go. - Now, Sarah! (groaning) Get out of the water! Get out of the water! (rock music) - Jason! (groaning) (rock music) (groaning) (groaning) - Pull the switch. (groaning) (rock music) (dramatic music) (rock music) (dramatic music) Are you gonna be okay? - Physically, yeah. I don't think I'm gonna get much sleep though. - Me neither. So do you want me to stay with you. - I don't wanna be. I guess I'm thinking the same thing. - Yeah. I'll tell you what. I'll meet you in your room in five minutes. - What do you have to do? - I just have to check on something. It'll only be a couple of minutes, I promise. - Okay. Just don't be long. - Okay. (ominous music) - Hey, don't get too excited. You were too aggressive before. Not good. K, maybe it was my fault too. I gave you too much. Made you angry. Even killed a bunch of people, and we can't have that. At least not yet. Next time, you make sure I can keep you guys under control until I have everything ready. (ominous music) (rock music)
