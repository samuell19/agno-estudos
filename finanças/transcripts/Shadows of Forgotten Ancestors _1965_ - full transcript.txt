Let go, brother! Let go! SHADOwS OF FORGOTTEN ANCESTORS Mikhail Kotsyubinsky The Carpathians, a Gutsul land, forgotten by God and people... My son Olekso, my darling son, I sleep and see you suffering. O merciful God, please save at least my last child, my Ivanko. O God... Horses, horses, my horses, horses! You hear, boy? No, they're lambs! They're lambs! Ivanko! Ivanko, come here! Come here, child! Come! Don't look, he's mad. Don't look. Come here. Glory to Jesus. - Glory to Jesus. - Glory forever and ever. Is this the Evil Spirit, dad? Ivanko, there's no evil spirit in church, as there's no Satan. There's a Satan among people. There. There, you see? He gives money to God, but he wrings the soul out of poor people. You're beggars! You place is outside the church, not inside it. Never mind. Wait till he comes out! Petrik, I beg you, it's a holy place! Petrik, I beg you! Help, good people! Trash, they deserve a flog. - Onufry, pay him back! - I'll kill him! They insulted our kin. Onufry, hurry! Lay off me, I know what to do. They're asking for it. The down-and-outs! Petrik, don't, they're bad people! I have to, Anno. I have to. I'm entreating you, Petrik! You will pay for everything, Satan! You Satan! - Petrik, I'm begging you! - Let go of me! I'm entreating you for the sake of our son, Ivan! - Mama! - Marichka, where are you? Take daughter and go to the cart, quick! - Mama! - Daughter, where are you? Mama! Marichka! It's nothing, I've got another, even better than this. They bought a new skirt for me, and baste shoes. I'll dress up and look like a grownup girl. And I can play the reed pipe. And why do you fight? Why were you standing by our cart? And why does your father fight? - He wasn't who started it. - He was! Oh, my dear brother, why have you left us? Why have you left your Ivanko? My dear brother, why have you left your kids? My dear brother! Your enemies drove you to your grave! What a death you've chosen for yourself! Oh, God! My dear Petrik, why have you left me? Be damned those Gutenyuks! May God send plague onto them, and death onto their cattle! Wait! Don't be afraid! What's your name? Your name is Ivanko. How do you know? And I'm tending lambs. And I'm tending cubs. Khimka stole flour from us. - Which one? - The witch. Petrik, why have you left me! May those Gutenyuks be damned! O Lord, send plague onto them, and death onto their cattle! Why have you left our little Ivanko... However, the death of his father did not live in Ivan's memory as long as his meeting the girl did. IVAN AND MARICHKA Do you hear, Ivan? Why not? I do. It's an invisible axe. Ivan, I'm scared. Why to be scared? See, a goat. Where? Ivan, where are you going? Where're my goats, where're my go... Ivan! Godmother, godmother, what did you cook, what did you cook? Beet borscht, beet borscht, beet borscht! Wait! Where are you from? From Yavorov! - And what's your name? - Gutenyuk. All the best to you, Gutenyuk. Marichka! Marichka! Ivanko... what is it, my Marichka? Will we be together? With God's help. There's a lot of ill feeling between our families. Don't worry, Marichka. I'm going to tell Mother, and we'll take you in. Oh, my darling Ivanko! Don't be sad, don't be sad, my sweetie! Marichka! You hear? Come here. No, we mustn't, Ivanko. Let them say whatever they want, but you will be mine. You hear, Marichka? Do you hear me? Ivan. We'll never be together. What are you saying, Marichka? Marichka! What's the matter, my sweetie? May the Gutenyuks' house be as empty as mine. May all their cattle die, Ivanko! - They destroyed our family, and you... - Mother! My dear. Could I ever think that you wouldn't be the master of the house, but would go to work as a hired labourer to earn a living? - My dear son! - Mother. You're leaving me all alone. Hold on, Mother. Let it be so. Let it be. Bless me for the road. Be happy. Good luck to you. O Lord! Save and protect my son Ivan, and save the souls of my children - Mikhail, Danila, Anna, Vasil, Mikola, Oleksa. Our Father in heaven, Hallowed be Your name, Your kingdom come... Give us day by day our daily bread... - Glory to Jesus! - Glory to God forever and ever! - Glory to Jesus! - Glory to God forever and ever! - Good luck, Ivanko! - Thank you! Ivanko went to the meadow, and she... - How did you sleep, Marichka? - How did I sleep? Very well, and you? Ivan! Marichka! So you're going, Ivanko? Yes, going, Marichka, such is my fate. I'll be back by winter. Wait for me. At night I'll be looking at the star that is over the meadow. You look at it, too. All right, we'll both be looking. Ivan! Marichka! Glory to Jesus Christ. Whose girl are you? Gutenyuk's? Oh, just look at it, Marichka. Oh, it's full, Marichka! Marichka, Marichka, eat some. What have you got here, huh? MEADOw They'll drive the cattle to us. I pray to God to help us return it to people in the fall. Whose son are you, boy? Pyotr Paliychuk's from Krivorivnya. I came to ask you to hire me. Will you take me? I'll be doing whatever you say. "Why don't you get married, Tall Beskide?" - the wind asks Black Mountain. And he answers: "Because Green Meadow won't have me". And so they stand together for centuries. Admiring each other's beauty, but they can't get married. And only the wind brings songs to them. I don't know. Why don't you get married, Tall Beskide... Do you hear? Ivan! Glory to Jesus. Miko, what is it? Miko, tell me the truth. What is it down there? Miko! Marichka! Marichka! How could you get drowned, such a young girl?! My child! Onufry, look for our daughter! Wait over there. Wait, Paraska. What a horrible death you found! Oh, my dear child... why have you left this world so wrongfully? Oh, my beloved young child, you had your whole life before you, but you have already gone to the other world. What a horrible death has fallen to your lot, my child... People thought he had died of grief, and girls made up songs about their love... Loneliness Mikolo, Dmitre, let's go! Come to me at Krivoye Field, I'll be getting married. Thank you. If I have time, I'll sure come. Dmitre, come to me on Holy Night. Come on, guys. Have a good trip. Good luck to you! Ivan, do not put out the fire, it should go out by itself. I know. Thank you. - How are you, Yevdo? - Fine. You heard what's happened to the Paliychuks? Did you see Ivanko standing under the wall? Ivanko? Such a handsome lad he used to be, and now he looks so miserable, shaggy, ragged, dirty, like an old man. Wondering about the woman of the house. The house is ramshackle, everything's died out, his father killed. He got no kin left. I heard he was selling the cattle, just one sheep... A rich man came from Bukovina, even this sheep... he's selling it. He doesn't even look like a human being. Oh, God... what a lad he was, and now... How are you, father? Good. How was your visit? Where are you coming from? I was at an Armenian merchant's, sold him an otter and a marten, bought some peppers and went home. And at the Jewish cemetery I saw Ivan Paliychuk. - You know him? - Yes, I know. He was digging a pit there, all black, it gave me shivers just to look at him. What happened to him... You know, Dmitriku, I want to ask you about something. Don't tell anybody about that. To what shame love can reduce a man! Oh God, spring is coming! The sun is warm, it melts the ice. And what about our Ivan? Who will wash his shirt, who will cook for him, who will bring him back to people? Oh, God! The house stands empty. Had he come to us, we would help him. Oh, God, what that love has reduced him to! My house nearly collapsed. I sold a cow and hired Ivan Paliychuk, the orphan, to build me a new one. Ivan has been working at my place for a month now. Poor man, he's thinking all the time, I don't know about what. I asked him, but he won't tell. I brought him something to eat last night, but he wouldn't eat, just sits, plays his pipe and thinks. - Where have you been? - To the priest's at Krasnoilye. What for? I took some bacon and stuff to him, so that he would seal the coffin for my son Dmitriku. I saw Ivan there. - Which one? - Paliychuk. He was painting planks or making a cross, I don't know, I got so distressed that I left. It was freezing cold. I got cold even in a sheepskin jacket. And he was just in rags. We had that frost here too. Learned people say that this year everything will be killed by frost. - How are you? - Good. Where have you been? With lads. - Our lads or Magyars? - Where can you find Magyars? Magyars were here on Holy Night, and the whole village... Oh, we drank and made merry, and sang kolyadkas with lads. Did you see Ivan standing there? - Sure I did. - Isn't he handsome? How did you manage to stir him up? I gave him a shot of vodka, a candle in his hand, an apple to eat, and he was happy. We made Ivan so drunk that he hung onto girls like a goat onto a willow. Ivan gets married... He had to build his own home... Ivan and Palagna The water's warm, isn't it, Ivanko? If your mother were alive, she would've washed you up better. You'll go to Palagna soon, will have your own wife in old age. Here, a towel, make Ivanko dry. He is going to Palagna. We'll make him dry, dress him up, and he will go to Palagna. He'll have a good life, and will visit us with his wife. Coming! Workdays Ivan... Christmas Ivan. Ivanko, where's my baby? Palagna, where's my baby? Take the breast, take the breast! Black magicians, drowned ones, at your bad hour please come to me for a good feast, for a strong drink. I'm entreating you. If only you disappear forever. Ivan, supper is ready. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. O Lord! Allow to have supper. Allow to have supper. Souls disappeared for good... Souls disappeared for good... Crippled on their way... Crippled on their way... In the waters drowned... In the waters drow... Drowned. In the waters drowned. There's good news in Bethlehem. The Virgin brought forth a son. In a manger, wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying among animals, the unbounded God gave in to sleep. Palagna, where's my child? And where's my child? Where are my goats... where're my goats, where're my goats? She has come? There's nobody there. Go to sleep. ...So their life went on. Workdays - for work, holidays - for sorcery TOMORROw IS SPRING God hadn't given them children, so Palagna practiced sorcery O Lord, Saint George, bewitch Ivan, make him mine, give me happiness, give me healthy children, a boy or a girl. O Lord, give me... why are you staring? Never seen women? I've never seen one like you, dear Palagna. I swear by God. Leave me alone! Where have you been, woman? Don't you see there's trouble? Praise Jesus Christ, good people. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Sorcerer ...They said about him: He's God to us. People feared him, yet they needed him I commit you, clouds and thunders! I'm sending you to woods and to waters! You have no power here! No power! No power! I charge you, go away! Away! Away! Go to forests and precipices, where no horse neighs and no crow flies. Away! Away! Yurochko! Something happened to you, Yurochko? No, nothing, dear Palagna. I've turned the storm away! Come here! I want some peace! Yurochko... TAVERN Praise Jesus. Glory to Jesus forever and ever. - Uncle. - Uncle. Glory to Jesus. Glory to Jesus. Glory to Jesus. Ivan! IVAN'S DEATH Look, Palagna. I hit here - the arms wither. I hit here - the legs wither. And if you hit here? The man dies. My darling! My dear Palagna. Yurasik! My darling! Sing, Ivanko, as you can. I shall sing for you so that you won't understand. Tell me, tell me, girl, where have I lost my mind? Or maybe you've hidden it in a birch-tree or in a poplar? When we fell in love, even dry oaks began to blossom. And when we parted, the lilacs withered. Oh, my sweet Marichka, my talkative bird. If only we had been destined to love each other for one summer. Remember me, Ivanko, at least twice a day. I remember you seven times an hour. And the apple-tree's shed its flowers. We had fallen in love as early as children. Oh, I went to the meadow, and saw a bird there. What are you doing now, my dark-haired Marichka? Oh, Marichka, I can't forget you! Oh, we'll never be together! Yevdo! The scribe got hoarse, he can't sing. Treat him to some vodka. Our Ivanko is no more, no more. Our Ivanko is dead, dead. Why have you left me? Our Ivanko is dead, dead. Our Ivanko is no more, no more... Lads, make merry! Listen to what I just remembered. Ivan asked me once to have him buried in the clothes that he wore as a bridegroom. It did surprise me then... Cast: Ivan - I. MIKOLAICHUK Marichka - L. KADOCHNIKOVA Palagna - T. BESTAYEVA Yura - S. BAGASHVILI Vatag - M. GRINKO Miko - L. YENGIBAROV Paliychuks - N. ALISOVA, O.
