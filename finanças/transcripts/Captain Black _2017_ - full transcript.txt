Trust me, I know. - Look, I got to go. - So Maria-- - Yes, Mike? - This is all pretty delicate, you know. I mean-- - I get it. - I mean I want to be there for you, but-- - I know. - This. - It's okay. You just can't right now. I get it. - Do you have someone, do you have someone to help you? - I'm a big girl. I'll be fine on my own. And Mike, you, you were good as Captain Black. See ya. - Oh my god. Lord help me. - Hello? - Hi. Hi. - Hi. Well come in. - Thanks. - Can I get you some water or something? - No, thanks. I'm fine - Oh, sit down I guess. - Give it to me. - No mine. - Just give me a minute. - Mine, give it to me. - Mine. Mine, give it to me. - Hey, no, no, don't. Uncle Mike is here and I need to talk to him in private for a minute. So just give me a second, okay. I'll be back. - The place looks great. - Thanks. - How are the kids? - Mike. - You know, this year would have been their 50th wedding anniversary. - I'm aware of that. - Do you remember, remember a long time ago, I told you that, that we should see each other more often. I was afraid that when we did that it would be bad. It would be because of something bad. Do you remember that? - I remember that. - This might be bad. - Okay. - I might be in trouble. - Okay. - I met a girl, and I think she might be pregnant. - Okay. - The thing is, when we met, she didn't, I never asked her how old she was. - What? - And I-- - Oh my god, what the fuck, Mike? - I thought about what happened to you. - What the fuck are you saying? - That I felt awful. - You felt awful? - I did. I felt awful. Of course I felt awful. - How can you come in my house with this and you tell me to feel bad? - I'm sorry. - You tell me this. - I didn't know what to do. - You abandoned me, Mike. You just left me. I was horrified and I felt alone, and you just left me. - I didn't know. I didn't know what to do. - Fuck you. Get out of my house. - No, I'm not gonna get out of your house. I want to talk to you. - No, I'm not talking to you. Get out of my house. You cannot talk to me. I am not here for you. Get out of my house right now. - No. I'm not, I'm not leaving. I'm standing right here. - No, go. - I'm right here. - Go. - I'm right here. - Get out. Get out. - Fine. - Out. - Fine. - Out of my house. - I'm going. - Yeah, come in. - We're not gonna do this again. Holy shit. - You're telling me. - She did not that young. - Nope. She did not. - And now it's like, what can you do? I mean this is-- - Don't I know it. - And she says she has to talk to her parents? Or a judge? - I don't want to think about a judge. - You tell anyone else? - My sister. - You're kidding? - Nope. - Jesus. How'd that go? Wow. - The girl, she called me a rapist. - What? - She-- - That's bullshit. Mike, I saw it. - I know. - That fucking little bitch. I mean I saw it. I saw it Mike. I didn't see it, but-- - That's not what I mean. - She was coming on to you all night long. - That's not what I mean. - Well what the fuck do you mean? - I mean that's not what she meant. I mean she understands the sensitivity of the situation. She gets it. - Oh, she gets it? - Right. - Great. She gets it. Fat fucking lot of good that does for us. Mike, I am here for you. - I know. - I just don't know what I can do. - I know. - I don't know if there's anything I can do, you know. - I know. I know. - It's like we're fucked. - It's like I'm fucked. - Yeah. You're right, I didn't want to say anything. It's like you're fucked. Yeah. It's your own fault. You looked pretty hot in that outfit. You're a good man. Don't forget that. - Thanks. - Don't do that, I am telling you something.
