- It's half past. Shall I? - Yes, turn it on. Like every night at this same time, it's... Professor Platov's TV Hour! Tonight, the life and work of Jacques Tati. Jacques Tatischefif a.k.a. Tat/j was born in Le Pecq, near Saint-Germain-en-La ye, on October 9, 1907. His paternal grandfather, Dimitri Tatischeff, was a military attache for the Russian embassy in France. His maternal grandfather, Mr. Van Hoof, was a Dutch picture framer living in Paris. Jacques was the second child of Claire Van Hoof and Georges-Emmanuel Tatischeff, who took over his father-in-laws framing business. He grew up at L Ermitage, the family home in Saint-Germain-en-La ye. Although his upbringing gave him an appreciation for art, Tati never had a master nor a mentor. His attraction for cinema came primarily through his body and through play. At 17, on the beach at Saint-Tropez, he gives his first mime performance, a soccer match as seen by a goalie - which he'll revisit 49 years later, along with three other sketches, in his last film, Parade. Two years later, his academic career less than bright, he begins apprenticing in his father's workshop. His future is clear: He'll follow in his father's and grandfather's footsteps and enter the framing business. But 1928 marks the start of two experiences that shaped him in his youth: his military service in the 16th Dragoon, the Calvary Regiment of Saint- Germafn-en-L a ye, and playing second row for the Racing Club de France rugby team, where he was the post-match entertainment, imitating the players, spectators, and referee of the match just played. In the military, he learns schoolboy jokes and rebellion against authority. As a result, in 1931, he leaves home and the family business to take the stage with a routine called Sflent Sport at the annual gala of the Racing Club de France. In 1932, Tati tries his hand at cinema, writing and starring in Oscar, champion de tennis, which was probably never finished and is now lost. He tries again two years later with On demande une brute, written with Alfred Sauvy, captain of the Racing Club de France and later a renowned economist. Tati plays the lead, supported by the clown Rhum, whom he rejoins the f0//owing year in Gai dimanche, directed by Jacques Berr instead of Charles Barrois. Step right up. Enjoy this fine weather. Just 35 francs a ride. A visit to the chéteaux, a pleasant drive, an outdoor lunch, and the local attractions, all for a set price of... Thirty-five francs. Step right up. But the stage is where he triumphs: at the Ritz in 1934 in a gala finale that includes Maurice Chevalier and Mistinguett, at Théétre Michel in 1.935 where Silent Sport becomes Sporting Impressions, and in 1936 at the ABC music hall with the same show. “Henceforth, " writes Colette in Le JoumaL “no party or artistic acrobatic show would be complete without this surprising artist who's created something new thatS part sport, part dance, part satire, part tableau vivant. Jacques Tab} both horse and rider, brings a fabulous beast to life for Parisian audiences: the centaur. ” In 1936 he also writes and stars in his first “real” film: Soigne ton gauche, directed by Rene Clement long before The Battle of the Rails, Forbidden Games, or Purple Noon. After his triumphant tour of European stages in 1937, he writes, stars in, and even directs Retour é la terre, which was also lost, probably unfinished. He takes refuge, probably in 1943, in Marembert, near Sainte-Sévére-sur-Indre - where Jour de fiéte would one day be shot - after he's drafted for a few months in Cambrai in 1939. On May 25, 1944, he marries Micheline Winter seen here in the light-colored dress in L'Ecole des facteurs. In 1946, he appears in Claude Autant-Lara 's SyMe and the Phantom, and very briefly in Devil in the Flesh. On October 23 his daughter Sophie is born. From May to November 1947, he shoots Jour de fete with two cameras: one for color, another for black and white. But Jour de fiéte wouldn't find a distributor until 1949. The black-ahd-white version was a smash hit upon its release and won the Grand prix du cinéma frangais. The color version would have to wait until 1994 for Frangois Ede and Sophie Tatischefi to find a wa y to make exhibition prints. His son, Pierre, was born on July 4, 1949. A little left. This way. A little more. Tati refuses to make a sequel featuring the postman. Three years after Jour de féte's release, he shoots Monsieur Hulot's Holiday, which is a smash hit in 1953 and wins the Prix Louis Delluc and the Prix de Ia Critique Internationale at Cannes. Monsieur. ...? What? Allow me. - Hulot. H-U-L-O-T. Your pipe. In 1956, before his father's death on November 23, he starts a production company, Specta Films, and shoots Mon oncle. Mon omfle, passed over for the Palme d 'Or at Cannes in 1958, receives the Special Jury Prize before receiving the ultimate award, the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film, the following year in Hollywood. Tati there asks to meet Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, Mack Sennet, and Stan Laurel. /n 1.961, while finishing the script for The Illusionist, which would never be made, Tatf is asked by Bruno Coquatrfx to put on a show at the Olympia. Come on, let's go! Gentlemen, on my command. Attention! Mount your cycles. One, two. Prepare for right turn... right! Good. Left turn... left! Very good. You're pedaling at normal speed for a letter. Attention, gentlemen. Telegram! From April t0 June, he stages Jour de féte é l'Olympia, a variety show for which he had part of Jour de féte colorized by his friend Paul Grimault. In 1964, a new colorized version of Jour de fiéte is released, and the sets for playtime are built in Join ville. Toward the end of shooting in 1967, Tati writes and stars in (Bouts du so“, a mid-length feature directed by Nicolas Ribowski. Gentlemen, if you'll kindly return to your seats, you'll find on page 88, paragraph two, angling- Gentlemen, let's see how it's done. In December of 1967... PlayTime is released at the Empire to mixed reviews. Although praised by the Nouvel Observateur and Cahiers du cinéma, in Combats, Henri Chap/er criticizes it as “a silly, pretentious allegory that isn't even funny." No, no, and no! This can't continue. Box office is decent, but not enough to recoup costs. Tati is forced to release shorter versions until runtime is under two hours. Franyois Ede, Macha Makeieff, and Jéréme Deschamps finally restore the original version in 2002. On November 16, 1969, Tatfs mother dies, and he must auction off his family home. Tati shoots a few commercials. He then sets off for France, Belgium, and Holland to make Trafic, which was quietly released in April 1971. In 1973, Swedish TV asks him to pay homage to the circus and variety shows. His own routines are included in Parade, his last film. With Jacques Lagrange, he begins writing an ambitious new project entitled Confusion. But debts incurred by playtime catch up with him, and in 1974 his films are seized, and his health begins to decline. In 1977, Tatfs royalties and films are bought by Nina Mo/lesena Del Monaco. With a group 0f shareholders, he creates Panoramic Films... allowing Tati to recover 46% of his royalties. At the Cesar awards ceremony in 1.977, Tatf makes a stirring appeal for the support of short films. If you want to reward short films, I ask the Centre national de la cinématographie, distributors, and theater operators - I beg you, support short films and allow young filmmakers to express themselves. Without short films, we'd never have had Chaplin, or Keaton, or Fellini. Or René Clément. Nobody. Please, take 1% of the profit from your ice cream bars and give young people a chance to express themselves. A documentary project called Forza Basfia, on the Bastia vs. Eindhoven European Soccer Cup final, falls apart in 1978. Sophie Tatischeff will finish it in 2000. In 1.980, Tat}; at his daughter's request, tells his life story t0 Jean L 'H0"te, cowriter 0f Mon oncle. The autobiography remains unfinished and unpublished. - You're forgetting something. - What? Shoe size. Right into the door - barn! In 7.982, he makes it a point of honor to finish, with Lagrange, the script for Confusion... but he dies on November 4 of a pulmonary embolism. Class is dismissed. An extraordinary mime who often said “a comic actors greatest skill lies in his footwork, ” Jacques Tati remains one of the great French directors, one of the rare few who managed, in only six films, to fully express his dream.
