[ Clacking ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Footsteps ] Happy birthday, baby. [ Sighs ] Sorry I'm late. My apologies. No worries. I won't keep you long. I have a deposition to prepare, and I understand that today was your wife's birthday. It is, yeah. I do not enjoy pulling you away from your remembrances, but I'm sure you understand that some conversations are best had in person. Now, you're sure your associate is prepared to do this thing? He is. Because the results need to be definitive. It will be. And where Luis is concerned, our intentions are clear? -Crystal. -GLEN: Good. This deal with the Russians is too important to let Luis Velasquez get in the way. Arnold will need to make haste. Because they want a cash deposit in my office by the close of business today. Not a problem. GLEN: Very well. Onwards and upwards. GABRIEL: Mm. Have a good one. [ Soft piano music plays ] [ Sighs ] [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Cellphone chimes ] LUIS: Hey, Carlito. Excuse the search. I got, uh, trust issues. I don't even trust myself. [ Chuckles ] You understand. I understand. LUIS: [ Speaks Spanish ] Yo, corrier, bring him some, uh -- some, uh, tequila. -Sí? -No. [ Chuckles ] I know you're strictly business. [ Rap music plays ] Let me bless you with information that might save your life. They're never gonna trust you here. To people like Arnold Solomon, you're just another fucking beaner. Just when you need them the most, they'll throw you under the bus because they don't like you. ¿Entiendes? [ Speaks Spanish ] I'm Luis Velasquez. I'm loved and respected worldwide. And you can be, too. You see, in light of the Russian threat, Mr. Solomon thought that having us as your partner would be a form of insurance. [ Laughs ] Yo, this guy kills me, man. Are you serious? You take those "Soul Train" shoes and get the fuck out of here. You stay your side of the tracks. I'll stay on mine. You understand? -End of negotiations, then? -Go. "End of negotiations." What the fuck is wrong with you? I should have fucking Hector just kick you in the ass. I don't need you or Arnold fucking Solomon to deal with the Russians. What if... What if Mr. Solomon raised his offer? LUIS: Let me think about that. Fuck Solomon. [ Dramatic music plays ] MAN: Hey! [ Laughs ] Carlito. Ah! Oh! WALTER: That was a hell of a game yesterday. I mean, winning isn't everything, but it beats the hell out of coming in second. You don't care for football where you come from, do you? Nah, you're all hockey crazy, I bet. You sure this is it? Looks like my accountant's building. My CI has wagered a parole hearing on it. We're good. So, doing anything nice tonight? I'm impressed, Detective. WALTER: It was an alert on my phone. Happy birthday. Thank you. [ Police radio chatter ] Can't scare it away with a hangover, Flynn. I'm fine. [ Dramatic music plays ] Who the hell is the slick suit? SS neck tattoo on a distinctly non-Aryan-looking customer. Marine snipers use that tattoo. They're not supposed to, but Scout Snipers tend to make their own rules. Really? Sounds like someone else I know. Bite me, Koschek. WALTER: In your dreams, tough guy. VANESSA: Look at him. I should run his plate. [ Dramatic music plays ] Fuck. Smile, little piggy. He fucking made us. I'm bringing him in. [ Car alarms blaring ] [ Flames crackling ] PARAMEDIC: Look at my nose. [ Radio chatter ] [ Siren chirps ] Everything checks out, Detective. You're free to go. Thanks. Neighbors didn't see anything. Nothing to go on other than what we saw or didn't see. We were stupid. Should have tailed him. Oh, geez. -VANESSA: Oh, Jesus. -Yeah. This is some crazy shit, Koschek. Hell of a day. Like Bourbon Street after Mardi Gras. LANIER: Yeah, well, the party's over. Me and Daley are taking over. Captain wants you two to go home. What? That's fucking bullshit. This is our case. -Whoa, whoa, whoa, down, girl. -WALTER: Dial it back, Flynn. What did you just say? Hey, we're just following Captain's orders, alright? But we had eyes on the suspect. And then you let him get away and all hell broke loose. Okay? It's not worth it. Screw you, Lanier.

He's ready to see y'all now. [ Folk music plays ] [ Music ends ] ARNOLD: The case goes to Follett. He'll know what to do. Carlo handled Velasquez like an ice-cold pro. He didn't want to negotiate, so your message has been delivered. Well, you can't say I didn't try. [ Dramatic music plays ] GABRIEL: Tell him. CARLO: [ Sighs ] Two possible witnesses. They were cops. Can they tie the hit to you? Or you to me? No, they were probably staking out Velasquez. I mean, pure coincidence. ARNOLD: This is your fault. -I know. -You should have been there. GABRIEL: He'll fix this. In many ways, Carlo is better at this stuff than I am. ARNOLD: This is your mess. You clean it up. You got 48 hours. CARLO: Consider it done, sir. [ Dramatic music plays ] You better. We need addresses. Right. Yeah, I called my department contact on the way here. I'm just waiting for him to crack open their files. Then we're good. I got a picture of their license plate, so it should be a done deal in no time. GABRIEL: Good, good. I got to get this shit over to Follett. Then I'll help you finish up. [ Dramatic music plays ] [ Bell tolls ] I think the Russians will be happy with the Mexican out of the way. Very well. Erica. With the successful conclusion of this deal, Arnold is going to become an extraordinarily powerful man. Thank you. Real estate's never been my thing. Yeah, too bad. Velasquez should have known don't go along with him. Do you know much about the ancient Greeks, Gabe? Well, they valued their liberty highly. The Greeks encouraged a kind of self-reliant individualism. There were no laws to speak of, so police weren't necessary. Sounds like my kind of place. But the ancient Greeks drew a line in the sand when it came to stealing or robbery. They did not like their cattle being stolen and they did not like their homes being broken into. But with no police, how would they find the culprit? Actually, they had various methods to determine guilt. One of them involved rounding up 12 suspects. And a judge would give each of those suspects a stick 6 inches long, but he would tell them that the thief's stick would grow an extra inch by the next morning. Invariably, the guilty party would chew off one inch of his stick, and then the next morning, he would be there holding a 5-inch admission of guilt stick in his hand. The point is, for the 30-something years that I've been a defense attorney, I have learned one irrefutable truth, and that is criminals are their own worst enemy. Can't say I disagree with you. Well, listen, I appreciate the delivery. And this deal with Vlad is gonna make everyone a lot of money. Arnold seems to think so. You don't? It really doesn't matter what I think. Listen. Arnold trusts you, and trust is a valuable commodity. Mm. He trusts you to protect him on the street, and he trusts me to look after his legal and financial interests. In that respect, we're alike. We've known each other for a few years now, right, Mr. Follett? You've been very kind to me, and I appreciate that. But... we are nothing alike. [ Dramatic music plays ] You're reaching. Come on, now. Breathe. -[ Groans ] -Breathe. You can't keep going on like this. The anger's gonna eat away at you until there's nothing left. -VANESSA: I know. -JIM: In Afghanistan, we both lived through some really bad things. But you were a cold professional back in the sandbox. You still are when your head's on straight. But you seem determined not to want to get any better. Think I should go to some overpaid shrink and spill my guts? Couldn't hurt. At the very least, you might save your career. I already know what's wrong with me. Every time I meet someone, I automatically think about the best and most efficient way to kill them. [ Chuckles ] I can't switch it off anymore. JIM: We've all been where you're at. You just got to learn to leave the outside outside. I got a class. You need anything, you know where to find me. Yo, guys. There you go. There you go. [ Dramatic music plays ] That's the guy -- Detective Lance Koscheck, 52. Past his prime. Look at him. What a sad fucking life. No family, orders takeout, eats it alone. My inside guy said that he and his partner got booted off the case this morning, so... Let's get her done. [ Wheels rattling ] [ Car door closes ] [ Gunshots on TV ] [ Knock on door ] [ Thud ] -[ Knock on door ] -Okay. Hey, brother. I'm sorry to disturb you, but I'm the distraction.

I like it there. One day, I'll probably have to stay longer. Ever wish we could have done things differently? What's it matter now? How long have I been training you to be my replacement? CARLO: Two wonderful months. Don't let Arnold shake you, okay? When I go, just act like me. In time, he'll trust you. I hope. I really want the respect that comes with this job, you know? What's the fucking point? [ Clears throat ] What about the other witness? Don't worry about it. It's my mess. I'll clean it up. GABRIEL: You sure about this? You know how important this is to Arnold. CARLO: I got a few hitters in mind, so we'll take care of it. You should go home. It's Alex's day. Yeah. Look, I appreciate that. By the way, what you get from this job, it ain't respect. It's fear. It's always fear. Remember that. [ Birds chirping ] [ Kettle whistling ] Happy birthday, baby. I miss you every day.

Shit, Lanier? -[ Gunshot ] -[ Gasps ] [ Air hissing ] [ Engine revving, tires screech ] [ Dogs barking ] Mierda. [ Groans ] [ Groans ] [ Groans ] Fuck. GABRIEL: Yeah. What's up? GARCIA: We have a situation here. -Ay-yi-yi. -The three guys I took are dead. -She's alive. -Are you serious? I know. I know. It's fuckin' shit. We fucked up. Okay. I'll call Arnold. [ Speaking native language ] Arnold will see you now. Stay. He don't want to see you. Are you fucking kidding me? GABRIEL: Morning, sir. You think I need to hear this shit from the Russian? Sorry. It's being taken care of. ARNOLD: Put a bullet in this bitch's head. Or I'll put one in yours. Like I said, it's being taken care of. And I think you should rethink those last few words. They're insulting to both of us. Yeah. Alright. I'm sorry. You know my mouth. Just get rid of the cop. It'll be done. No worries. You have my word. Later. Let's get out of here. Jesus Christ! Scared the crap out of me, Flynn. -How are you? -How are you? Tell me what you know about the Velasquez hit yesterday. DALEY: Forget Velasquez. Tell me where you been? We found machine guns, three very deceased John Does, and a stack of spent brass at your house. -Three John Does? -Yeah. Three. One on the lawn looked like he'd been put through a meat grinder. No dental records, no prints. Guy on the lawn was Lanier. Oh, bullshit. VANESSA: It was him. Did you know? -No, no, fuck no, Vanessa. -Did you know? -Of course not. -You're his partner. You're fucking in on this, too. Yeah, I'm his partner, but I'm not married to the guy. If he's dirty, it's got nothing to do with me. They had my home address, Daley. I didn't know. I swear. Has anyone heard from Koschek? No. Look, you need to come in. Alright? Captain's pitching a shit fit this morning. She's about to issue a BOLO for you. I think I'm better out here for now. You're crazy, now. Look... we'll just go in together. We'll just ride right over to the precinct. Listen, you got to find Koschek. Put him in a safe house. If this guy came for me, he's probably gunning for Koschek, too. He killed Velasquez, now he's coming for the witnesses. Then you definitely need to come in. I got to go, Daley. Where you going, Vanessa? You know it isn't safe for me. What do you mean it's not -- Vanessa! [ Cellphone buzzes ] Yeah? You finally decide to return my call, you fucking asshole. Did you kill Lanier? Did you kill my partner? GARCIA: Excuse me? [ Laughs ] No, no, no, no. I ask, and you answer. Get it? Where is she? She's on the run. Now, listen. This whole plan of yours is getting good cops killed. You're going to make me cry. [ Laughs ] Listen, I want out! GARCIA: There's no out here. You want out? You go buy yourself a fucking razor blade and cut your fat fucking wrist, you dirty cop. I hear nothing. So you find her. Get me an address. Or I'll pay you a visit. [ Line clicks ] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! We definitely underestimated her. She's well trained. Daley's sending me her file, actually. He's another loose end, you know? He's good with computers. He's smart. Best thing of all, he's scared of me. -Mm. -I'm serious. He's terrified. He'll do anything I say. For now. As soon as he ceases to be an asset, he's a ghost, so... By the way, we need someone to clone Flynn's phone so we can trace her when she answers. You got someone? I don't, but Arnold does. [ Clears throat ] I'll give him a call. -Miss. -Alright. Hello? Walter? [ Gasps ] Oh, Walter. Fuck. Hey, I need to talk to you. It's important. I need your help. Of course. Anything. I need you to get me some info on someone. Who's the lucky guy? Uh, Scout Sniper. I think he's local. Pull up a chair here. See what we got here. VANESSA: Can't find anything on our database. -Guy's a damn ghost. -Lucky for you, my database starts where the P.D. leaves off. Wait. That's him. Scout Sniper courses takes men like this and teaches them to do things that most of us would find difficult to stomach. Some men are just good at killing. Yo, V, if you want me dig in deeper, I need to know, what's our level of emergency? He killed my partner and another officer last night. What can I do? If you run, he'll find you. -[ Scoffs ] That's comforting. -That's the truth. This, uh... This is Carlo Garcia is in a whole nother league. You're fighting out of your weight class. I'm going to put a cap in this fucker. You're gonna get yourself killed. Well, I can't run. I can't fight. They have someone inside the department, so I can't turn myself in. Doesn't look like I got a lot of options. Shape your battlefield and wait till he comes for you. It will be unexpected. So you've got to be ready. And then? If you're lucky, you'll get your shot. Hm, that's, uh... terrible advice. I know, but you don't go chasing the devil. So you fucked up. Now you need my help. GABRIEL: She has her cell, and we have her number. All we need is someone to hack into it, track her down, Carlo, and I will take care of the rest. No big deal. This is his problem. I know, but he's my partner. ARNOLD: Only for two months. You think he'd do the same thing for you? GABRIEL: I would hope so. I want to say something to you, and I mean this as a friend. Go ahead, shoot. I'm concerned that you've become unreliable. GABRIEL: It's been a rough couple days. We'll clean this mess up, and then it's clear sailing. No big deal. I think you need a vacation. You're getting old. [ Scoffs ] Yeah, both of those are correct, but be honest with yourself. You looked in the mirror lately? -[ Chuckles ] -I'd trade my soul to be 20 again. What are you two rambling on about? That youth is wasted on the young. And unfortunate that experience is wasted on those who don't take time to enjoy life. Arnold, I have a lot to do. We'll be back here this evening. Let's go. I'll call my guy. He'll be in touch. Alright? Take care, Gabe. Let's go. Later, boss. [ Birds chirping ] Seven languages. Combat action ribbon. Firearms instructor. Detective Service ribbon. Police star. Geez. April 2nd. April 2nd. [ Crickets chirping ] [ Line ringing ] This is Officer Lopez. -I'm looking for Daley. -He hasn't come in today. I'm covering his desk. -Where is he? -Ma'am, that's not -- This is Detective Flynn. I need to speak with him. LOPEZ: Detective Flynn? I'm under strict orders to advise you to come in. [ Cellphone beeps ] Damn it! -Good to see you. -Oh, nice to see you. If you guys need anything else, I'd be more than happy. Business or pleasure? What do you mean? What you're thinking about. Well, well, a little bit of both. Intriguing. Mm-hmm. Yeah. I'm thinking about Gabe. What about him? Honestly, he's becoming a liability. I don't want to pry into your business. You know that. But remember, Gabe doesn't just work for you. He's your friend. That's what makes it so hard. MAN: Hey, what the fuck? Hey, what are you guys doing? [ Screaming ] ARNOLD: Give me the fucking gun. [ Gunfire ] Look at me, motherfucker. [ Gunfire ] [ Cellphone ringing ] Yeah? What's up? CARLO: Gabe, they've hit Arnold. -Oh. -Took one in the arm, but he's okay. -Who was on point? -LaFontaine. Arnold was having dinner with his wife. They made a mess of her. -Where they at now? -City medical center. Second floor. [ Siren wailing ] [ Indistinct talking on P.A. ] He's been asking for you. How's Tomi? She died on the operating table. Arnold is going to be raising hell. As official counsel, I must strongly advise against that course of action. We spent too many years turning this into a legitimate business to throw it all away over a base desire for revenge. So your ancient Greeks don't believe in an eye for an eye, huh? GLEN: Well, actually, they called it necessary reciprocity. When Odysseus returned to Ithaca after the Trojan War and found that his wife Penelope had been unfaithful, he murdered all 108 of her noble suitors, and then he slaughtered and mutilated his own servants for allowing the indiscretions to happen. Sounds like a man who brought his war home with him then. He did indeed. And everyone paid the price. So I'm leaving. Whether or not I return will depend on Arnold's course of action. But I am not interested in fighting a war. Having said that, I don't think you and I will be seeing each other again. I like you, Gabe. Don't get caught in the undertow. They killed her. They killed my wife. -Carlo. -Yes? Clear this room. Get out of here now. CARLO: Alright, everyone. Let's go. Do as the man says. Get out of here, boys. Don't move. I'm sorry. -Boss -- -Shut up. Don't talk. You see that? You see what you fuckin' did? Stop it! Get the fuck out of here. Go! Go. Close the door! Carlo, stay. I want them to suffer. Don't you worry, baby. They will. First, you're going to need some rest. -Not if they're still breathing. -They won't be for long. We go to war, we need you thinking clearly, alright? Stakes are way too high. ARNOLD: You're right. You're always right. GABRIEL: I'm gonna stay here for a while. Go find out what you can. I'll see you later, man, okay? Thank you. [ Indistinct chatter on radio ] I loved her. She loved you, too. I'm sorry, brother. ARNOLD: I really loved her. I know. Oh, fuck. [ Siren wailing ] Shooters were professionals. Not from around here. What kind of gun they use? In Mexico, it's known as a cuerno de chivo because the magazine looks like a goat's horn. They just love it, and they definitely use it to make a statement. If you asked me, the money is on the Colombian Mexican. Someone tied to Velasquez then. Or made to look that way. Oh, yeah? Who do you figure? Have we heard from Vlady? I don't know, boss. What motive would he have? Me out of the way. Makes things a lot easier, doesn't it? Follett's gonna be pissed if we move on Vlady. That's for damn sure. ARNOLD: Fuck him! I'll handle that son of a bitch. It's my call. You sure about this? ARNOLD: You're goddamn right. They killed my wife! We're talking about her! Fine. You got it. It'll get done. CARLO: The hit had to be retaliation for Velasquez. Vlady has no motive. I'm telling you, Arnold's losing it. This is a mistake. You don't just hit a Russian mobster 'cause you're pissed. [ Cellphone buzzing ] Got a hit on the girl. She's at the Terrace Motel. Great. Deal with this, then I'll finish her off. Question. Look. I'm trying to hide it in the front. Looks like a big fat dick, so I just -- I don't -- I don't know what to do. How do you hide a gun with a camera? How do you do it? [ Sighs ] Buck up, man.

And I'm still here at the kids table, huh? They don't let you listen to the grown-ups talk either, huh? -Disrespectful is what it is. -Yeah. Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey. No, no, no. Strict orders, no visitors. Arnold called Vlady. I have a delivery for him. -Don't you go in there, Gabe. -Why do you say that? I have an appointment. I am making a payment. -I don't give a fuck. -Look, I have an appointment. Here is the envelope. Listen, Vlady makes his Russian calls, but I make all his American calls on the accountability that he does not speak great English. -You're lying, dude. -[ Chuckles ] I don't know, man. Maybe they texted each other. But it's going to be me or you. Either way, he's going to have to get it. You want to take it to him? Go ahead. I'm sorry, Gabe. Thank you, brother. It's been tense.

ARNOLD: What's with the attitude? We just kicked a hornet's nest for no good reason. ARNOLD: I gave the order. That's all the reason you need. What's the deal with the fucking detective? You gave me your word. So take care of her. -I will. -Don't tell me. Show me. I'm telling you. He's losing it. Drop me at my car. CARLO: Got to take a shower anyways. I'm all fucking covered in Esteban. REPORTER: Bodies of a nightclub owner and three of his staff were discovered in the charred remains of a property fire. A pair of audacious cartel style killings rocked the city yesterday when gunmen opened fire on a restaurant in Jackson. One of the shooting victims has been identified as Tomi Solomon, wife of local real estate magnate Arnold Solomon, who's long been suspected of having ties to organized crime. Solomon, seen here -- You went after the competition. But the competition hit back. [ Birds chirping ] [ Keys jingling ] [ Door opens ] GABRIEL: Gabe here. Leave a message. CARLO: Hey, Gabe. Where the fuck are you? This is the third time I've called. We're here at the motel waiting for you. This is going down whether you're here or not. No answer from Gabe. Let's roll. You want it all, don't you, bastard. [ Footsteps approaching ] [ Lock clicking ] [ Man talking indistinctly on television ] [ Pounding ] On the floor quick! [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] What the fuck is going on out here? [ Gunfire ] Fuck. [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Tires squeal ] Get in! Fuck you! Get in or you're dead! [ Gunfire ] Come on! [ Gunfire ] [ Engine revs, tires squeal ] [ Cellphone rings ] Yeah, go ahead. What the fuck are you doing, Gabe? Have you lost your mind? You don't understand, man. CARLO: Quit the fucking bullshit right now. Just bring her back. You're playing with my life. GABRIEL: Ain't gonna happen. You know what happens now? I wrote the book. You do what the fuck you go to do. [ Carlo speaking Spanish ] [ Speaking Spanish ] [ Sighs ] Put your safety belt on. [ Siren wailing ] [ Cellphone ringing ] [ Ringing continues ] Go ahead. What the fuck is going on? GABRIEL: I'm done, man. I'm tendering my resignation, sir. ARNOLD: You quit when I say you quit. Now, where's the girl? GABRIEL: She's with me. That's where she staying. If you're smart, you'll let us both go. You think I'm going to let her walk away? GABRIEL: Listen, man. You were with me when Alex died, right? Tomi is dead now. ARNOLD: You bring that up, you piece of shit? Don't let it ruin your life, my friend. I'm going to hunt you down. Don't make promises you can't keep, okay? ARNOLD: You know what this means. Have a good night. [ Beep ] [ Sighs ] Bring me that bastard's head. Let me bring you in. You can turn state against Solomon. We'd both be dead before I could testify. That guy, Carlo Garcia, he your partner? GABRIEL: Yeah, he was. If we're lucky, he'll put as much distance between us as he can. I had lots of luck lately. All of it bad. Oh, relax. How much worse can it get? I've got a feeling I'm gonna find out. [ Clattering ] [ Cork pops ] Relax. Sit down. We can both use this. Is this your wife? Yes. Yes. VANESSA: She passed. Mm-hmm. You okay? Look, you've worked for Solomon for years. You could have dropped me back at the motel. [ Chuckles ] Now we're having drinks. Why? I made someone a promise. Alex. She wanted me out of this life. Get away, escape to Africa. Put my experience to good use, protect the elephants. Fight the good fight. She discovered she had cancer. After she was gone, I was lost. Arnold was all I had left. [ Sighs ] I'm sorry about your wife. And I'm thankful you let me live. But you're still a mob soldier, and I'm still a cop. GABRIEL: Yeah, well, I'm afraid all I've done is delayed the inevitable. We're both probably going to die tonight. VANESSA: So what's your plan, then? What, have a drink, drown your sorrows, and wait for them to come calling? Yeah, well, pretty much, yeah. I built this place, designed it. The walls, the furniture. Everything's reinforced and fireproof. And Alex's bathroom is a de facto panic room. It's a fortress. You got booby traps? [ Chuckles ] I've got guns. -That's all? -A lot of guns. And I know how to use them. Plus, those guys are coming to me. Got home field advantage. I've killed people for a lot less. Yeah. You have, haven't you? Yes, I have. Let's get ready for our guests, shall we? They'll be here soon. Nothing short of a direct hit from an artillery round will breach this room. If things go south, and they will, lock the door and lay in the tub. Hiding is not my style. Sometimes it's a difference between living and dying. Well, if shit hits the fan, I know where to find you. Hm. In the tub. Duly noted. I don't know what happened. I mean, that fucking cop. Just get rid of them both. Whatever the cost. Both? But he's my partner. He's one of my oldest friends. I got no choice. I mean, is this even worth it? Survival of the fittest. CARLO: When Gabe brought me on, I knew there'd be a day when I'd be the one you'd call when things needed to be taken care of. He made his choice. Now you make yours. You got it, boss. [ Door closes ] [ Vehicle approaching ] A bunch of serious looking assholes. And a guy with a porn star mustache. GABRIEL: LaFontaine. Open the damn door, Gabe! VANESSA: He dangerous? Could use a better deodorant maybe. Come on. I ain't got time for this horseshit. Don't nobody do nothing unless I say. Gabe, I'm taking that lady cop back to Mr. Solomon. With or without your consent. GABRIEL: Just like that, huh? LAFONTAINE: Yep. So, what's it gonna be? So let me get this straight. I let you take her, I go free. Sure, Gabe. For old times' sake. Okay. Sounds like a good deal. For old times' sake. [ Gunshot ] [ Gunfire ] [ Groans ] [ Gags ] You done fucked up now, Gabe. Perhaps. [ Gunshot ] It'll take them a while to regroup, but they'll be back. [ Birds chirping ] VANESSA: You had it good for a while, didn't you? Cars, big house in the country. Plenty of money to save lots of elephants. I'm guessing your wife never knew where it all really came from until she did. And that's when you had to make your promise. Jealous? I sleep soundly knowing I put away the bad guys. Well, I guess there's no softer pillow than a clear conscience. One time, a meth dealer on the east side. We served a warrant and kicked in his door at 4:00 a.m. He had three kids. Daughters. What he made them do. Parents are supposed to protect their children. I drew down on him. Not an officer there would have talked. So, what did you end up doing? I called CPS and arrested him. I believe in the law, Gabriel. I guess that's why you're a better person than me. Just like my Alex. The guy we're waiting for, how good is he? GABRIEL: He thinks he's as good as I am. He is younger. Mm. Not very reassuring. Yeah, well, it wasn't meant to be. What if he's better than you? Bath time. Because you'll be next. [ Crow cawing ] [ Doorbell rings ] Mind if I come in? I've asked him for five minutes to talk to you. You owe me that. Come on. I got it. [ Exhales deeply ] Some people claim there's a woman to blame. But I know... ...it's my own damn fault. [ Speaking Spanish ] Caused a lot of trouble, senorita. You sure you want this? What's done is done. We have five minutes before those guys come storming up in here. Ex-agency shooters, SX contractors. You know, the real deal. I'm sure you'll tag some of them, but they'll get the job done. Why are you doing this? She's no one! Man, don't make me kill you. You're assuming a lot. Like a fucking western, huh? Like a fucking western. Love it. [ Sighs ] I'm much younger than you. Much faster. Better looking for sure. I'm ruthless. I can kill you in a heartbeat. [ Groans ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gags ] [ Gagging ] What a waste. [ Groans ] GABRIEL: It's time. Solomon's not paying you enough! Go home! Live to fight another day. Any of you fuckers want to leave, I'll kill you myself. Our mission is to take this motherfucker out! None of you get paid -- [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Glass breaks ] [ Gunfire ] [ Beeping ] [ Gunfire ] I'll go. I can cover the driveway. Go! Go ahead! Go! Go! Go! [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Explosion ] [ Gasps ] [ Grunts ] [ Gunfire ] [ Grunting ] Ah! [ Grunting ] [ Gunshot ] I thought you said this house was impenetrable. GABRIEL: Well, I thought so, too. I'm a contractor killer, not a contract builder, okay? [ Sighs ] This doesn't look good. Come on! Take that out now! Time for me to get some fresh air. Bath time. There you go. Stay hydrated. [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] MAN: Over here! Behind the truck. [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire, bullets ricochet ] [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] Aaah! [ Gunfire ] [ Gunfire ] [ Explosion ] [ Groans ] [ Gunfire ] [ Grunts ] VANESSA: Jesus Christ. Men that work for me must be capable of violence. And also understand the power of a well-placed threat. Yes, sir. Marine Corps? Navy. SEAL Team 4. ARNOLD: I need new shooters. My last guy moved on. Won't let you down. [ Groans ] This is for Luis Velasquez. [ Gunshots ] [ Door opens, closes ] [ Crickets chirping ] Do me a favor. Take care of this for me. Sure, I'll do that. Hey. I got your back. MAN: You alright, Gabe? Yeah, man, I'm good. [ Elephant trumpets ] [ Elephant trumpets ] -You okay? -All good, all good. Come on, guys.
