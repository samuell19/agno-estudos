Ricky Henderson was smoking. You could be the next best thing, man. Now the max wants you as well as the AE. But Hey, like I said, you went to Ohio. He went to tech and we still had 30 games left. She could have reached the nifty 50 Mark. I mean, I know this is crazy. Just this timing with everything happening right now. Now there's new. As you're telling me, I got something to tell you, I'm all ears. And I met this woman almost like somebody she's like move my soul. You tell me, where'd you meet her at the club at a club. You don't meet no wife. He had no clue. Oh, that's the thing. She looked like she didn't belong in that club. That's what I had to go talk to her man. I was on the phone with this woman for like three hours, man. I ain't did nothing like that since high school and man I'm up. You're feeling like a little kid.

All the backlash that goes. Cause a lot of people don't want to see you dead outside. You ready? You ready for that? That's not my problem. That's their problem. But I do know she's okay. Obviously you feel alive for this woman, man, to be in your wife and you guys may end up having kids. Okay. Is that going to hamper? You wanting to continue to play baseball? Because at this point in our life, like I said, six years in the league. Okay. You've been out for two with this injury. You got about three good years left. I can't have no sidetracking right now.

His name is a feeder and uh, we met at a nightclub and [inaudible] stricken. No, he's not African. He just has an African name. He was born and raised in Oakland. His parents were born and raised in the United States. Actually. You know his father. I do. Do you remember in 2003, around that time that there was a fire Pacifica and it burned down that warehouse and that black fireman saved the family and he died while he was saving them. Oh, I do remember him. He was a good man. He did for those families. You know what? He was well respected in the Bay area. And I say more and you know what? I remember his son. I remember watching his son talking about his father at the funeral, all my gun. He was like, Doris, is that him? Yeah. Okay. Little mama. You go and you know why? But I am looking forward to meeting him. Okay. When do you plan on bringing in? But I think very soon, You're the mimic yellow, even though you're crazy. [Inaudible] you ain't never seen a bed. She won't even get what you're doing. Oh, I'm writing the speech. Um, you know, my old school USF. They asked me to come back and talk about my, my career and they're going to give me a mentee and I'm going to be a mentor. So I'm just, yeah. I'm just writing to honor. Yeah. It's nice to give back, you know, that's what's up anyway. How was your, um, work out with your agent? Oh man. Cool. Look, I'm gonna tell you something. It's so cool to have an agent. That was an athlete too. I mean, I do really understand what I'm going through and he has some for me too. I mean, my knee is getting better. Uh, I think it's time for my comeback. That's nice. How do you think of back? I'm gonna watch this movie or something or? Well, no I'm gonna tonight is movie night. So I mean, I want to interrupt you. No, no, no. I tonight's our movie night anyway, what do you want to watch? Oh, it's comedy. I want to laugh. Are you serious? Why you say, because I thought you would want to watch something serious. I mean, I'm serious. I like to laugh some time too, but you always thinking, yeah, I like that about you. Thank you. Can I ask you something if you had to change? Well, what is like one thing you would do could, okay. You got me up here thinking, um, well you'd like to think, right? You know what, honestly, if I could eradicate the word, the word n***a. Yeah. I mean, I get it. It's slang as part of the culture and all that. I mean, seeing people that's not even black calling each other n****r, but if they understood like the history of it and how it was used to present the human brain, it's just so much violence and death associated with that word. That's what I want them to do. You're right. I mean, honestly, people don't understand the power of our words. Like we throw around words. Sometimes we don't even think about where they're coming from. You know, like what we name ourselves, call each other. Where's a powerful and we just, we don't think about it. You're right. We need to think about what, where the words came from. Like, even for me, like one of the things I hate is like the use of word, Hispanic or Latino. Like it's one word that we didn't even name ourselves. It's like somebody like the census named us. And like we use, they use that word a group of bunch of people together in a way that only highlights the European identity and erased the black and Brown identity people. So it's like, yeah. So it's I know it's hard. I know. So, I mean, I get you, I mean, it's not comparison comparing to the N word. That word is not even mine. Like that word, that word. I mean, I grew up with it too. Like people calling each other that, you know, part is the casual environment, but you know what? That word was not used to oppress me in the way it was used to oppress black people. So I don't own that word anyway. But what was your first experience? No, honestly, I think I was like about 10 years old. Me and my dad's watching this movie and they was just throwing that word around like left and right. I mean, it was like n***a, this n***a, that n***a n***a made him. And I was like, no, I heard the word before, but I never really knew what it meant that, what does that word mean? You know, Sophie, it told me a story that his dad told him, I guess he had grew up in a racist town and black man had did something and got hung. And when they cut him down, the word n***a was like scratching his forehead. And at that moment I realized how serious that word was and just the violence attached to it. And after that, I just made a deal with myself. Never use that word, condone other people using it either. So I hear you. I agree with you, but look, you got me getting off deep up and we're supposed to be watching a comedy. You know what I'm saying? What movie we were watching. I know, but you need to take a first. I'm going. To take a shower too. You can use the one down the hall. Okay. I'm going to use that one in my room. Oh God. That was horrible. But you know what I really liked about this system that they featured all the female pilots. That was like I said, they worked that in there. Well, that reminds me of you. She is, she was the first female, Puerto Rican, U S military pilot. And she was one of the first women of color commercial pilots in the entire world. See like me and my family, we kind of like all secretly wanting to be pilots. Like we're obsessed with flying. So I grew up like really looking up to Olga and what she did. You're smart. Thank you. You're smart. I like spending time with you. I like spending time with you to send me someone like you was my key to follow. Hey, I've got one for you. Alright. One days as a thousand years and the thousand years as one day, your day begins when you boom. And your date ends when you die. So I say to you, enjoy your day. He on her. So do what you love and love what you do. But most of all, make sure you stay true. Now, how you like that one? Now I wasn't going out today. I ain't going I'm good, man. Can just clean me up.

Both of my parents came here legally and they work damn hard for everything they have. So how about you stop playing the victim's car, blame everybody and stop getting free stuff from the government and get up on your ass and work. You know, honestly, I'm pretty for it. The diversity, you know, I mean, as a man, sometimes I get tired of hearing. We have Alita talk about her Weblo and then eating the same tacos every day and then hearing Bhandare like, I get really tired of that. Sometimes. Like my hands shaking, I just need some fried chicken and some Kanye Western times, that's all I'm saying seriously. You know, I don't discriminate. If she Ella bad, she held the bat. That's all I got to say. I'm getting sick and tired of black people, always playing the race card, not getting nominated for the Oscars really well. You know what? I would like to see a Latino cast in a lead role for once over it. You know? Uh, I'm an old school kind of dude, you know, like I can appreciate like a fine new being princess, but I think we've got. To kind of do our own thing. You know, like we're two different warrior tribes and I got to stick to my tribe. Black people got to stick to that tribe. You know what I mean? At the end of the day though, booty is the language of the universe. Filming. How you doing? I'm good, man. I can tell you a family really loves her song. [inaudible] you need to talk that feature about bringing some Mexican girlfriend to my party. You know, going to be there. And she loves her son with Joel. I just don't want him to bring her look. I know it's your party and all your friends are going to be there, but your brother wants us to meet this young lady. Now I'm not okay with his choice of color either, but he's his own man. And he's an excellent son. This is a great opportunity for us to meet him. Why always take your side every time I'd be done. I have a problem. It just seems like every time he and I have an issue, you just take his side. It's not fair sides. I don't take sides. I make decisions. Now whether you date in an alien or not, I will support you so long as you respect my rules in my house. I will support you until you die. Look since your father passed, it's been hard. I'm trying to do what's best based on what he would have done. I just don't think you guys see my point of view on issues. It's my party and I don't want him to bring her. I'm just not going to go. I just don't want no one at my party. They ain't black. Wait, are you a racist? Cause that's what I'm getting right now. No, I'm tired of seeing attractive black men dating outside their race. That is sounds personal. Your brother's girlfriend is welcome in my house period. [inaudible]. We got to let us come together. Sometimes we argue too much, too much hate in it. [inaudible] so where's your girlfriend, honey. She covered, she just had to take her mom to the doctor for a little checkup. She didn't drop out. Okay. Well I'm excited to meet her. Oh, she here. Hold on. I gotta let her know. Okay. I don't agree with it. I don't agree with it at all. Our black men and women need to stick with each other. Any other kind wouldn't understand our struggle.
