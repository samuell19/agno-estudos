[Mouse] I never dream. [melancholic piano instrumental] But that night I did. If I was a superstitious person, I would have taken it as a sign. A marker of dread and foreboding omens. I remember feeling full of fear as I awoke that morning. A feeling that's supposed to fade as you leave your sleep, and return to your bed, your job, your coffee. Except that feeling wouldn't leave me. It would stay with me all that day into the next. Because some feelings you just can't shake. [loud bang] Some feelings stay with you 'til the end.

On the small scale, let's say I got here by taking the bus. Hm. And how are you getting home? Same bus. [chuckles] I didn't-- I don't mean it like that. I know, you're a real stand-up guy, Ugly.

Because Ugly is just... Ugly. [laughs] Oh, he's gone all shy. [chuckles] [sighs] Oh, God damn it, Kelly. I brought you flowers. Yeah, nice flowers, dickhead. You're not supposed to be back here. I told you that last time. In fact, last time, I told you that it would be the last fucking time I tell you. So, why don't you fuck off? Mama! [Mouse] Mama, unsurprisingly, ran Mama's.

Maybe he works for Moony. Maybe Moony's changed his business. Dealing wasn't enough, so he's gotten into girls, too. Sent his suit guy to take a look around. Well, if he's getting into girls, he's probably moving in on someone else's territory, Someone who I'd imagine isn't too happy about it. -Craw Daddy. -Craw Daddy.

These body snatchers you're talking about? I let 'em play in my sandbox, so I leave them alone. So, you do know who they are. They're ripping girls off the street. I know that doesn't exactly pluck at your heartstrings, but think of it this way. Girls like Doe Eyes, already smoking glass, on her way out of dancing. That's usually your bread and butter. Like you said. They all come around eventually. These guys are snatching girls off the street. Girls that would have been yours eventually. Where does that leave you? Nice speech. You know your audience, Mouse. So... maybe I know something. Something has a price. Something always does. Go on. Take a look. Pretty nasty, huh? Guy in that photo is Judge Andrew Taylor and the girl underneath him ain't exactly his wife and she ain't exactly of age. What I need you two to do is take these photos and go squeeze that judge a little. Let him know I have copies. Give him this number to call. Why don't you do it yourself? Well, he's a judge. So, if this thing blows up in my face, I'd rather you two go to prison. I get the call... I give you the name. Simple. You know, you seem like a real piece of shit. That's because I am, sweetie. [Mouse] Now what? How are we gonna find out where this judge lives? What? What? [hard rock music plays] [Mouse] Everyone's running from something. And it turned out, Ugly was running from a trust fund and parents who never loved him. His dad was a lawyer for white collar criminals and saw a lot of the judge we were trying to blackmail.

They have sex parties over there. Dark stuff. The clientele are all high-end. Foreign businessmen, heads of state. I've heard they snatched girls off the streets. Girls that no one will miss. You got a name for me? It's not a name you say out loud, you know, but... The Dame. [Mouse] The hotel Craw Daddy gave us was as old as the city itself. A place where the rich and powerful went to plan how to fuck over people like us. The daytime was pretty quiet. The rich attended charity fundraisers for the latest earthquake, or scholarship programs for urban minorities. But at night, the mood changed. It was that feeling of dread and foreboding omens, like they were gathered here for some purpose. Like they had some dark secret in common. Whoever The Dame was... she was deep into something sinister. [Ugly] Hey, what about him? Didn't we see that guy? The tanned guy? No. Same car, different guy. Hey, how do you think the world's gonna end? Hm? Like, how do you think it's gonna go down? Probably run out of resources. -Too many people, right? -Right. And I was thinking the only way to curb that, would be to, like, get rid of a fuckton of people. Like, six billion people, that the one billion left had a bunch of resources to split amongst themselves. Some kind of military state decides who gets food and who doesn't. Who lives and who dies. That's a bit of a pessimistic view, but yeah, I mean, I guess. Yeah, what I'm saying is, if that's what it takes to save humanity, why the fuck would we want to save it? Let us fucking burn out. I don't want to live in that world. What do you mean? Think about it. Everyone around you will have signed off on this "kill most of the people on the planet" plan. It's not the kind of company I want to keep. I'd rather die with the sheep, than eat sheep with the wolves. I don't think the world is that organized, Mouse. There isn't some secret global conspiracy. I think most people wander aimlessly through life, making moment to moment decisions that end up being the totality of our person. Good or evil, without us even being aware. Most people aren't like you, Mouse. Most people suck, Ugly. It's not hard to beat that. [Mouse] Bitching about the wolves of the world wasn't going to help us any. So, we decided to tell Moony. I wasn't convinced that he didn't have something to do with this. He was the glue in some way. Also, I still had to work at Mama's. Fuck. 100 pound matte cover stock in cream. Nice card. I also keep an eye out for the man in the suit when I worked the night shift.

[chuckles] I was just like you when I was younger. I wanted to save everyone. Hell, that's why I bought this bar. I wanted this to be a place where girls could come and be whatever the fuck they wanted to be. You know, feel safe. You could tie someone up, get naked, hit shit, get hit.

Mouse, where you been? Around. Your comic, the first issue sold huge. Really? [Dirt] Yeah, I couldn't keep it in the store. I think you could get it made into a real comic. Your take. Thanks, Dirt. [Dirt] You've got to give me more. My customers want to know what comes next. Yeah, yeah, I could, um-- I could work on it. [Mouse] Problem was, I didn't know what happened next. [distorted music playing] Getting snatched was a bad idea. But we were short on good ones. [Craw Daddy] You gotta understand how these people work. They don't just steal any old gal off the street, they do their research. What do you mean? They inquire. You go through the proper channels so these girls don't get missed. The only reason I know about these guys is because one of them came poking around after one of my girls. They asked and you said no. She was a good worker. Also, I'd be fucked if I let him cut into my business, so I told him to fuck off and they haven't bothered me since. These people are careful. So even if I said yes to doing this thing... I'm not sure they'd believe I changed my mind. There's a better way, Mouse. [Craw Daddy] Mouse. Listen to your friend. [Mouse] They were right, of course, but camping outside the hotel hadn't helped us and we had to get up there where those girls didn't have a shot. Maybe it was the coffee again or maybe I was just getting paranoid, -[phone ringing] -but something dark and terrible in the back of my mind told me we might already be too late. Eddie. Wow, wow, wow, slow down, Ed. [Mouse] Dread. [Ugly] What happened? [Mouse] Foreboding omens. [Ugly] Jesus Christ, when? [Mouse] Bad coffee. They found Riz. [sirens wailing] The sirens again. It was like this moment had already happened. From the day she went missing, I knew I'd be standing here, bathed in red and blue lights, looking over her body. -What happened? -What is it look like? That's that guy Kelly's car. One who was always lurking around Riz. He didn't do this. How are you so sure? He's just the fall guy. They're getting rid of evidence. I swear, I didn't do it. Who told you she was in my trunk, huh? [yells] Who made that call? -[car door shuts] -[sirens wailing] [Ugly] Where's Mama? [Eddie] Maybe we should go by the club, see if she's there. [Ugly] Mouse? [Mouse] I could use a drink. [upbeat music playing] Mama's at the morgue. Said she won't be coming in tonight. Riz used to play this record for me all the time. -Thanks, Sweets. -Yep. To Riz. Oh, he doesn't drink. I will for her. [glasses clinking] Oh, shit, I got to go. I got the kid. You gonna be okay, Mousey? [Sweets] Okay, I'll drive you. [Eddie] All right, thanks, Sweets. [Sweets] Ugly, you can lock up, right? Sure. [Mouse] Riz was dead. There was nothing me, Ugly or anyone in the fucking world could do about that. Was Doe Eye still alive? I didn't know. But I had to get up to that hotel. For myself, for Riz. We gotta get 'em, Ugs. [Ugly] I don't know, Mouse. The world is a fucked up place. Every person on this planet, all of us are born to die. But not like that. Not fucking like that. [Ugly] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. It's okay. It's okay. Just hold on to me. Just hold on to me. ♪ Oh baby ♪ ♪ Never gonna back up and walk out on us ♪ [music fades] [birds chirping] [glass clinking] [Mouse sighs] [Mouse] Now, I knew what happened next in this story. And I hated it. [melancholic music playing] [sighs] When people like us show up dead, no one bats an eyelash. -No one sheds a tear. -[sighing] But I did. [Ugly] You okay, Mouse? [Mouse sighs] I guess. Hey, about last night, I just wanted to say I'm sorry. [Mouse] Why? Well, we were all feeling fucked up about Riz, and you were drunk and I had a shot, which I never do, and I... Ugly, what the fuck are you talking about? I'm sorry I kissed you. You don't remember, do you? No. Look, it's fine. Things happen when you're drunk, right? That's why you should stick to water. Right. So... are we square? Yeah. Yeah. So... what now? We call Craw Daddy. [Craw Daddy] I keep the money. All you have to do is make the deal. [Craw Daddy] You know what you're getting yourself into, right? Last night they found Riz's body stuffed into the trunk of the car. I am fully aware of what they're capable of. [Craw Daddy] Let me think about this. No promises. Like I said, might not believe I've changed my mind. Uh-huh. [Craw Daddy] You know... I think I was wrong about you. Probably. [Craw Daddy] I don't think I'll be seeing you in my line of work anytime soon. [call ended tone beeping] [Mouse] It took a few days. [phone ringing] But finally he called. [Craw Daddy] No dice, Mouse. They don't want to do business with me. Sorry. [Mouse] And that was it. We had no way to get up to the hotel. No way to get Doe Eyes. I walked the streets at night looking for another way in. Looking for some whisper. Maybe some rich kid would pick me up, take me to some secret party he was going to. [car passing by] But nothing came. Sometimes with your back against the wall, you try a risky play.

I know we're supposed to be clean if we wanna work here, Mousey, but I started using just so I could keep my energy up, you know? For the dancing. Anyway, I-- I was home and I get a knock at the door which... surprised me because I never get a knock at the door. And the rest gets a little fuzzy, but I remember putting up a fight. What about the people who... What about the people who were there? They're real powerful people. You could hear them talk about murders and laws being passed. But they're the ones who are meant to protect us, you know? Watch out for us. They're monsters in skinsuits, Mousey. When did Riz show up? A few days after me. She was stronger than me, you know. Not that it did her any good. Fought back. Some of them liked it. That I'm made for good sport. She got bought by some bad men. What are we gonna do now? You listen to me. You need to get out of here and you can't come back. Ever. These people don't do loose ends. They will track you down and balance their check book. Do you understand what I'm telling you? Ugly, meet me at my place in a few hours, okay? What are you gonna do? You can't stay here either. I know. But I can't leave just yet. I should be leaving. I shouldn't even be at my fucking place. I should be running like hell, but I'm not. We got Doe Eyes back, but I still had that feeling of dread. It wasn't enough. There were more of them. The others. There would always be more of them. Mama was right. I don't think I can save them all. I find myself back at the same spot, -drawing, writing... -[knocking on door] ...trying to figure it all out in my head. I had to make a record of what these monsters were doing. I had to get it all down. -[knocking on door] -Coming. -[Moony] I love you. -[door slamming [ominous music playing] [The Dame] Hello. You only wanted a nibble, but it looks like you got the whole wheel of cheese, didn't you, little Door Mouse? No one calls me Door Mouse. Really? He did. Poor guy. I guess that's the danger that comes with the company you keep. Indeed. I brought you here to talk. And to let you know that you will not bring down my organization. It is stone hard statistical fact. We win. We are in far too deep. We have our hands in many, many pockets. We are safe. That being said, I will concede that letting you escape with Doe Eyes was an unforeseen mishap in regards to whom I trust. As you can see by this corpse between us... that mishap has been rectified. And now we should talk about how to move forward. Because, and this may come as a shock... I hold no intentions of killing you. Oh, yeah? Should I be grateful? Yes. Yes, you should. On this table is an envelope. In it you will find two tickets for you and your friend, Ugly. It will send you far away from here. Can I ask why I get the pleasure of walking away from this one? It wasn't afforded to my friend Riz. That is an understandable question. I think I won't kill you because in many ways, we are very much alike. Oh. You don't think so? Time... is an incredibly powerful thing. There was a time where I was like you. I believed there was a system of ethics in place in the world. A scale by which all people are weighed. Time changes that. I grew to understand the true nature of people. There are no good or bad people. The concept of a structured moral ideology serves only to make you more vulnerable to the real truth. Which is that there are only predators or prey. And in a stratified society, the only logical position to take to ensure your own survival... is to become a predator. You don't understand that now, but in time, I think you might. And when that time comes... you should call me. The system is always looking for talented young people. Additionally, I am sure you will not be coming back for me. Because if you did... I would peel the skin off your friend Ugly's skull and make you watch. But I really hope it doesn't come to that. I don't think it will. You're a smart girl. And smart girls know when they are being given an opportunity. Think of this as an opportunity to rise above your station. Make something of yourself. You can only crawl on the ground for so long before the dirt starts sticking to you. Who sold you Riz and Doe Eyes? I think you know the answer to that question. [knocking on door] [knocking on door] [tense music playing] Fuck. Where the fuck have you been? [ominous music playing] ♪ [music intensifies] [music stops] Everyone get the fuck out. [people screaming] Hello, Mama. You have to answer for what you did. For Doe Eyes. For Riz. The Dame sold you out. Just like you sold out them. Sold them into slavery. Why? Sweetie. You-- you wouldn't understand. Don't. The bar was going under, Mouse. Had been-- been losing money for years. Honestly, it never made any money. Doe Eyes. A teen girl's going down that path before, it was-- [Mama sniffles] It was only a matter of time before she was out on the streets selling her body. So you sold it for her? I told you you wouldn't understand. It was either give them Doe Eyes, or shut the bar down and... turn all you girls out onto the streets. Watch the world devour you. I-- I made the-- [sniffles] I made the tough call. Right. The tough call. And Riz? [melancholy music playing] What about Riz? Riz wasn't my choice. They pressured me. But you got paid. You took the money, right? Yes. And she died. Yes. [sniffles] You killed her. I want you to say it. I wanna hear you say it. I-- I killed her. They're all scum. Craw Daddy. Moony, The Dame, all of them, scum. But you know what makes you worse than them? They never once pretended to be otherwise. You pretended to be our mother. Our protector. And you gave those girls up to monsters? You let Riz die. In a dark corner. At the bottom of the world. -And now you have to answer. -[Mama] Wait. Get out of here, Mousey. Make something of yourself. I love you. [Mouse] This was my last performance on that stage. It was as if the world started spinning backwards to slow down time, because the world is just and kind sometimes. It slowed, as Mama reflected on how she had spent her time on this Earth. The good she had done, the days she had wasted and the people she had betrayed. And in her final moment, she thought of Riz and Doe Eyes. -[gunshot] -[thud] You all right, Mouse? Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine, Ugly. The Dame expects us to be on a train tonight or she'll have people come after us. After you. I'm sorry that I dragged you into this, Ugly. It wasn't right. I need you to get on the train tonight. Get out of town. Be safe. Without you? Yeah. Fuck you, Mouse. You ever think for one second I got myself into this? And I don't wanna leave? That I will stay here with you no matter what. No, you didn't. Because at the end of the day, you just don't want to feel bad if you get me hurt. Keep yourself bulletproof. Well, that's too fucking bad. I'm staying. Or you're coming with me, but... I'm not leaving you. You remember when I said you were a stand up guy? That it was what I liked about you the least? Yeah. I lied. I'll meet you at the train. And-- and we'll go. I know you. If you leave right now without knowing that you did all you could, you'll regret it. I don't want you to do something you regret. You have to be able to live with it. I'll meet you there at midnight.

[ominous music playing] The dread was too heavy. And Ugly was right. It had to sit right with me. There's no place a train could take me that was far enough away to forget what I had seen. [gunshots] That monsters are real, and they walk among us. The Dame was arrogant enough to let me go. Arrogance is always the downfall of the rich and the powerful. It blinds them. They never see us coming. There are some evils in the world that just need endings. And there's some feelings you just can't shake. Maybe tomorrow morning, normal people all over the city will awake from fearful dreams. Fears that will fade as they start their day. Perhaps without dread. [gun clicks] Foreboding omens.
