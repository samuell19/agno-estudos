Where are you going? Let's go. Coming. You young guys walk like blind. What's the matter? He scolded me with four-letter words. I didn't. He did it again. Hot temper does not match with an old man like you. Mind your own health. You curse me! Scold him in Shanghai dialogue. How? Use your imagination. Don't you run. Stop him. Stop running. You want to crush my balls! How dare you! Yours are flat already! I'll crush your balls too. Mine are still useful. Are you alright? I am alright. Can't compare with you young guys. Actually my legs hurt too. Are you really alright? Stop it. The palm lines are good, let me see your face. Fine as well. You'll have a leisure life. Really? I mean it. Bastard. Let's go. Yes, right away. Sorry. Have you taken care of that old man? Yeah. I read this lady's palm, her hand is soft. So you're having a good time. Bye. Bye. No danger ahead, but you zig and zag. Come on, shape up. Have you found the janitor? Not yet. What are you waiting for? What the hell? It's really hell. He is the janitor. Open up. We're C.I.D. Something smells fishy here. Nothings wrong except you. Let's go. Is the place haunted? Not here. See? But about upstairs... There are complains of singing noise tonight. Practically every night. Who's the singer? She's called Waterloo. Thanks. The old man has no shadow. She lives in Flat 3B. You talk to her, I'll wait downstairs. Let's forget it. What are you afraid of? Let's go. Here's the place. Be next to me. Be independent. I'll wait downstairs. Come right up if I scream. No need. What can I help you? What's up? We are police. C.I.D. Please come in. Let me do the talking. Why not me? I am more tactful. I... This way please. Now what? Alright, let's take turns. Who's first? You first. Surname, please. Tai. Given name? Waterloo. You live here? Yes. I... Your turn. Three questions already. Miss Tai, it must be lonely to live alone. Singing is a good solution. The neighbours should not have complained. Oh yes? Hey, look, I'm on you side. Because I am also single. Wish I could hear your singing. Thank you for your understanding. My friend can tell you about me. Your turn. Pardon. So you are... Three sentences already. Your friend's name, please. He's Fernando Ng. Mister Ng... No, we call him shoe Horn Ng. What? He has got a shoe horn face. His turn. Introduce me. No need. I have been introduced already. I did it. We have a question, Miss Tai. Do you have any intimate boyfriends? I just can't... Need to piss? No. But you look like it. I'm anxious to speak to her. No matter, go ahead. Where? To the loo? You say it. Say it. He might hear us... Whisper to my ear then. Speak up. You speak up. Your tongue. Ah Ma! Oh, is it the fuse? - Open up. - I can't. - What now? - Use your gun. Charge. Hurry. Which way? This way. Cut! All right. Alright. Alright now, Tak. Get up. Didn't I ask for two extra layers? Is he dead? Almost. Take off your beard. Alright? Yes. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Let's call it a day. - Yes. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Prepare the platform dolly for the next shot. What? It's too terrible. Are you scared? I'll turn my face. - Last shot is really fantastic. - Thank you. Bye. - What did she say? - English. I know, but did she say anything about me? I don't think so. Why did you say "Yes" and "Thank you"? That's all I know. - Let's get changed. - "Yes." Meal's ready, papa. "Thank you." We're looking for a friend. - Now what? - Let's play Mahjong. We miss one player. - Uncle. - Tak. Papa. You are very late. It's great, papa. You have kept papa waiting for an hour. But girl-watching is your entertainment. Right, uncle is young at heart. Hey, others think, Lung and I are brothers. Yes, they think papa is my elder brother. Just like your grand-papa. Oh, you... Can you teach me to chase girls? Let me share some ideas. Actually, girl-chasing is easy everywhere. And the main point is for fun, not for marriage. Then how come you had Lung? It was an accident. Papa, don't feed him such ideas. Don't worry. I'll have many children. Adopt one from Tak, Lung. Let's order food. Yes. Waitress. Just a minute. Which one did your papa pick? Yes, sir? No appetite. Let me recommend. Please do. Steamed shrimps. No, papa is allergic to it. How about deep-fried squid? But you have diabetes. Steamed fish then. Don't you know my son has rash? Then... Anything the matter. Nothing I recommended pleases them. Let me. Can I recommend a few dishes? Yes, please. Steamed shrimps? Good. Deep-fried squids. Splendid. And steamed fish. Super. You are so considerate, miss. It's mutual understanding. One more dish for you, alright? Preserved pickled fish casserole for you. Yes. You are welcome. What a smart girl. She's making fun of you. Let her then. Papa, really. Uncle, you are an interesting man. One catty and three taels. Your choice is always correct. Very fresh. And the fish? Good. Are you alright, uncle? Just feel tired. I'd better leave now. We'll have snack together, papa. Fine. He always acts like this. He even left me in the middle of a game. I was only nine at that time. Is he your real father? Or did he pick you from the street? He would prefer this way. Your father is even more peculiar than mine. Will I be like this? Will you be a father? Maybe. If you'll help me. Help you be a father? No, help me to chase girls. That singer. Oh, so it's her. It's folk song. She's hard to get. But you'll help me. And this meal... I'll pay. Can't wait a second. Nuts. - Table for two, please. - This way. Don't just stand here. Move. Singers nowadays, are not like before. Watch it. - Are you blind? - Sorry. Don't lose your temper. Sit down. Encore. Encore. - Many thanks. - You're welcome. Encore. - Thanks. - My pleasure. Slap me. She's walking towards us. Am I dreaming? What's yours, sir? Ng Kuai Tak, Tak for short. His name means nothing expensive. I'll have beer. Me too. Oh, it's teasing. - Shall I ask her to sit down? - Don't tease me. - Miss. - Hello. I know you'll like to talk to us. But he doesn't like... How can you say so? No? Sit down then. Please. Didn't you want to say something? How are you? Just this? From someone who's here 16 weeks in a row, I know what he's after. So you've noticed him. 16 is my lucky number. Tomorrow is my day off. Mine too. Date her now. Shall we go for movies? None is good lately. And I can't write poetry like Shakespeare. Tell me about your decision later. Where do you want to take her? Haven't thought it out. Let me decide. You can read my mind? Yes, a motel for lovers. Some request. Thanks. Three coins in a fountain from Mister George. Yes. Sorry. I don't know this song. What? This song was very popular. And you call yourself a singer? Yeah, let mister George to teach you. Repeat after me. Three coins in a fountain. Sing. I can't. Today is mister George's birthday. How can you? Take this chance to stand out. Hero rescues beauty story, still works. Are they really your friends? Take your chance. Stop it, you two. None of your business. Oh yeah? Asking for trouble? I won't bully old people. Do you dare to, sonny? They look down on me. Not you but us. We'll leave then. You said they're your friends. Not these four. Go. On your feet. You won't bully old people like us. No, but you have to pay for the damages. All right. Captain, cheque please. How much? HK $3,650. Here's my address and phone number. Call me. I'll call before picking you up tomorrow. Where are you taking her? We'll go swimming. Let's go. Where to? Pick up my swimming trunks. How about snack for my father? Right, snack first then the swimming trunks. Alright. Want to get killed? You said so just now. Almost knocked you down. Fill me up with this. Gobbledegook. Bangladesh, Bangladesh. Robert, Robert. One, two... Move it. Drop dead. Don't you go. I'll get you. My car is better than your taxi. Wait till I get you. Faster. I'll get you. Here I come. Why do you touch my forehead? Follow me. Where to? Do you want to be a homeless ghost? Only I can take you to your new home. Let's go. Look, it's coming. - Don't wet the cover. - Alright. Papa. Papa. He's sleeping. Be careful, it's my papa's treasure. Why is it so precious? It's an antique. Put it down and let's leave. But your papa... He's sleeping. Your noise will wake him up. Nothing will. He sleeps like a log. So he is. Uncle. Uncle, I'm Tak. Still sleeping. Uncle. I'll kill you. So sound in sleep. What's the matter, Tak? Your papa and his vase, are both crazy. What? One touch, and his vase is in slow motion. I touch your papa, he has no action. - You touched my papa? - Yes and no. Come in. This vase. Where? All the vases are here, which one? This one. Why the noise? Uncle, this vase is precious. Because it's unbreakable, and can do slow motion. Really? Unbreakable, you idiot. I'll show you. Don't. I won't hurt anybody. I can do it. It's breakable. I'd better go home now. Bye. Tak didn't do it deliberately. Yes, he did. Clean up and go to sleep. Good morning, papa. Where are you going? Take a shower. Don't go near any water. Is water unlucky for me today? Yes, don't touch any water. Oh, yesterday was wood. So I had to sleep on the floor. You were destined to be short-living. The teller said you would die young. But am I not alright now? All because your mother lent you 30 years of life. Is that why she died young? No, actually she was destined to live 100 years. Then how come she died so soon? She was kind-hearted, lent 10 or 8 years to an aunt. Another 10 or 8 years to a neighbour. And she lost track of counting. I figured out she had lent 200 or more years to others. Hers is quite a meaningful death. Wait, I am already 29 years old. That's why you have to be exceptionally careful. And I prayed everyday you can stay alive. Papa, there's no guarantee. Why don't you lend me 10 years of yours? No, a true man counts on his own self. Alright. Count on myself. Abandoned, I have to live on myself. Can't afford to lend out years. Where are you going? To swimming. Have a ride. Remember, keep away from water. Don't drink water, don't even mention this word. Our House God can't protect you there. Alright. Can I piss? The more the better. - I'll have a drink first. - Alright. You must be thirsty. This way please. The view is nice. - Here. - Fine. - Right. - Yes. If you don't mind, I think we should follow the plan, okay? Waiter. Coming. It's hot. That art director is here. Check, please. She's neat, do you know her? She always acts like a foreigner. And make foreign friends only. Okay, let's go. How nice to bump into you. I'd like to discuss about tomorrows' stunt action with you. Fine, we'll be early tomorrow. - All right, see you, bye. - Bye. - What did she say? - Nothing important. Ready to order now? - I'll have a lemonade. - Make that two. Water is unlucky to you today. Wait, wait... Anything non-aquatic I can drink? There's nothing like that! Give him beef satay. I'll have draft beer. Beef satay is not a drink. Right. What keeps Tak so long? Fat people are slower than others. Especially in changing clothes. Look. Are you crazy? You are like a patched condom! Dressed like this! Wearing plastic bags! He's crazy. Is it really so strange? - Why, of course! - Ignorant. Like Frankenstein. Why do you dress like this? Easy on the plastic bags, will you? Have a heart, Lung. Can these plastic bags make you float? His father said water is unlucky for him today. Is your father a prophet? No, but he is my father. Today just isn't his day. Water will make him sick. Is it true? Frankly, Lung is a germ-carrier. - So don't you get too close to him. - Alright. Won't you go over there and leave me here? Let's go. Go. Can't you take these off? Yes, but I won't go near water. Alright. Here. It's mine. Can I have the ball back? Hey, what are you doing? Won't you play elsewhere? What? How dare you? Drop him. - One, two, three. - No. Is he dead yet? Do you dare to do it again? I didn't mean to. Hit me? - No. - Shut up. Get up. No, no. This will give you a lesson. Let's continue. The ball is mine. Let's make a circle. He's the one who hit me last night. How dare you? I'll kill you. What shall we do? Charge. Run for your life. Just like that. You're still alive, your papa is wrong. Spit now, and don't say that again. Sorry, sir. Fine aim! Lung, tell my papa, I won't go home for supper. - Alright. - Supper's served at Police Station. Shut up. Lung, jump once again. Yes, director. Go on. Is the preparation alright? - No problem. - Lung, hurry and get change. We are waiting for you. - All set? - Yes. Has Tak arrived yet? Not yet. It's late. Did you see Lung? - He's having make-up over there. - Thanks. What is it, Tak? Oh, I thought you were Lung. He's coming. Tak. Thanks, Fung. Why are you so late? The traffic lights would always turn red. And I met girls in red clothes, on my way here... So? Papa said, red is unlucky for me today. Then what about those bank-notes in red? The more the better. Assistant director. Calling for you... - How can I jump with this dress? - Ask the art director. - Where's she? - Maybe she hasn't arrived yet. Sorry. I'm late. - You handle it. - Traffic jam. Late is late, nothing to do with jam? Yeah, late is better than "no come". But how can such a fast car be late? "Yeah, you shut up." Alright, I go "open work". He has something important to "mouth fighting" with you. What about? It's dangerous for me to jump wearing this. But it's a must. You can't finish a whole sentence in Chinese. Even an idiot can tell. It's impossible to make a jump in this. Are you calling me an idiot? No, I just say even an idiot can tell. So you must be able to tell, too. I quit. But you must apologise, whether you quit or not. I have to check "A-PO-LO-GI-SE" in the dictionary. I quit now. - Make it thicker. - All right now. - Tak, you'll do the stunt. - Isn't Lung supposed to do it? - Lung just quit. - If he quit, both of us quit. Tell the director. - Which director? - Big Boss. Tak, hurry and change clothes. Yes, right away. Another director in red. I'll be damned. Tak! Are you doing it or not? Right away. Tak, are you alright? Take care of your own self. What do you want? Can we have a look inside? Sure! You need such clothes first. Where can we get these clothes? Two ways. Either you finish high school, be worthy, enter H.K.U. and graduate, work 18 hours a day for three years, and know apple-polishing. Then you're qualified to wear this. If not? Or, I give them to you, then you go in, I leave. Oh, no. Then just sit here. Watch which end of your friend comes out first. What if head is first? He's alive. If tail is first, then he's hopeless. How about sideways? The door is not wide enough. Wait here. What can I do? Pray for him. Is he alright, doctor? Can you put on another expression? You take me for an actor? Lok, you'll be responsible, if anything happens to Tak. Can you control yourself? As his best friend, you should do the stunt. Instead of letting him do it. You... Why are you here? Why can't I be here? You come for this nurse? No, the one lying inside. He's dying any moment now. It's fate. Can't do anything about it. Nobody can change it. Are you sure it's him, and not someone else? Absolutely. He's mine. I don't think so. Time's up. Don't worry. I've never made a single mistake. It must be a mistake. No, you're wrong! Don't stop me! It's a mistake, he's mine! Time's up. Let me go. - Go away. - Find the doctor, this patient is hopeless. - Yes. - Go away. You've spoiled my mission. It's your own mistake. All for you. Doctor, it's a miracle. A miracle! Oh, no. Tak. Hi, you look great. Don't say unlucky things. You're too superstitious. Alright, I keep my mouth shut. I'll prepare some fruits for you. For yourself too. Please keep your mouth shut. How kind of you not to blame me. Wish Lung can be like you. What about Lung? He blamed me for causing your accident. Oh really? He seldom treats girls like this. How does he behave? He'll talk more and more softly. And his head will be lower and lower. Why? He's shy. He's different to me. When a man faces his secret lover, he goes either crazy or illogical. Right? Tak? Are you alright? Why are you looking at me like this? Not you but the one next to you. Why are your eyes so watery? Let's go. Yeah. I am not through yet. Then the sooner we leave, the better. Aren't you going to help me? My happiness depends on it. Don't talk like this. What does your fall have to do with your happiness? True friends. True feelings. - Are you really alright? - He... He's as gentle as a lamb. Lok complained that you were rude to her. Don't mention her. Why? Because of you. Really? You are afraid she'll know you like her. That's why you're deliberately rude. Now it's late. You can always make it up. An apology will work. If so, I am willing to do it. Why not? Take my word. Right, Lok? Have some fruits, Tak. Thanks! - Pardon me. - I am sorry. Fine, both of you have said "sorry". Now, everything is alright. - Have you met my friend, Lily Ting? - Hello! His friend, Lok Wan. Her boyfriend. Don't be angry. - Tak is here. - That's fine. Tak. - Uncle. - Papa, auntie Pearl. How is everybody? Tak, are you alright? I'm alright. You shouldn't let him do such dangerous job. I didn't know. Can't you foretell it? Oh, this room is so green, and is facing west. The screen is blocking the door, too. No wonder he had an accident. But he's alright now. Alright? Only externally, but not internally. Accidents are bound to happen again soon. Please help me to move this bed. And this screen too. Buy some white paint and repaint this room. Here is a hospital, not your own home. Then check out at once, Tak. Oh, no, I plan to live one more month. Check out now, it's not a park. Well, let's check out first. Please give me a pig's arm. Which one? This. Is it this one? What are you doing? Oh, it's you! I was killed by a dropped pot. I was killed by broken glass. My death was a tragedy! Why did you take our spirits but not his? It's not fair! It's this hand which took away our spirits! Chop his hand! Are you scared now? - No! - Chop his hand, chop... No, no! Three pieces for one dollar. Fish balls and bean curds are good too. Please buy some. Want some fried peppers too? I want three pieces, quick. I want two dollars. Hurry. Coming, coming. - Only two pieces, where's the rest? - Alright. Yours. One dollar of fried pepper. What are you doing? What's the matter? Are you alright? Hey, I want fried pepper only. Why don't you go home and rest? Let's pack up. Want some ointment or what? Come with us! Stop harassing me! - Come with us! - Stop it! He's a lunatic. Don't run. Dodge the cops. Where? Dodge the cops! Where's the police? Idiot. Never mind about him. Dodge the cops! Watch it. What is it? The cart is broken. He's badly wounded. Let's go. Hurry and call the police. He shouldn't have run into the road. He's bound to die. He has stopped breathing. He's doomed. Don't you want to live? Sorry. Be careful when you cross the road. Please hurry. You first. There are ghosts. There are ghosts. Let's go up and check. Hi, pal. The elevator is here. Please leave. This elevator is out of order. Why did he push open this door and jumped? Why did he have to commit suicide here? What shall we do now? Call the police. Go now. Everyone has their destiny. Lung, please don't be too sad. Let's go. "Come." Watch it. Be careful. Lung, the art department did a good job. It's finished within two days. Rest Uncle Chiu's soul in it. Aren't you exaggerating? But that's the way movie people are. Uncle Chiu's coffin, is handmade by the art department. By the way, why is it so light? Oh, it's made of breakaway wood, for cremation. So it's lighter. Mister Chui. Your father's coffin has just lost its bottom. Oh, no. Lung, it's all your fault. It's an accident. I am sorry too. Tak, you should stay with Lung more. Naturally. We are like brothers. Try to cheer him up. And be patient with him. I know, papa. I won't fight back, even if he hits me. Yes, that's a good boy. Say something nice. Right, I'll just comfort him. - Too formal. - Then what should I say? Talk about anything, but not his father. Not only father, but also papa, daddy or uncle. Just remember that. I won't even talk about foster father or grand uncle. Lung. Please come in. - Please sit down. - Yes. He's alright. Any drinks? We'll help ourselves. Lung, there are no straws. My father never used them. Oh, just drink it, won't you? Lung, this set of sofa is quite nice. Did you pick it yourself? No, it... Don't say it, I know. What do you know? I know who bought the sofa. Please don't say his name. I don't know what are you saying! Your father bought this... I didn't mean to say this. My auntie gave it to me from Europe. See, I know his father didn't buy it. Lung, why don't you go out and relax. - Yes, shall we... - Shut up! Lung, David invites us to dinner tomorrow. Why? It's his father's 80th birthday. But he won't live much longer. Eighty years is a very long life. Stop saying such things. Let's watch TV. You have murdered my father... It's not my fault, let's turn off the TV. You do the talking. Can you speak? Papa is dead! Papa is dead! It's really not my fault. Don't kill my parrot. Lung, you're needed at Studio A, tomorrow. Really? Yes, Big Brother's film will start tomorrow. What kind of film is it? Oh, forget it. Why? I can't say it. Say it. Papa's Adventure. Tak. I know you are very considerate. But I am alright. I told you his father's death is nothing to him. He can always have another. What? Nothing. Why don't you change the furniture? "Good idea." I'll design for you. Alright. Let's go and do the shopping. What about me? You can pay. Tak. What? What are you doing with my bird and fish? What's the next programme? To the movies! Nice! How about the 21:30 show? Fine. But I have to go home and get changed. You're a sucker. - I like to. - Me too. I'll pick you up then. Bye. Be punctual. Taxi. What the heck? - Lung. - I don't feel well, I'll go home. Then what? See you at the cinema. Be punctual, I'll buy your ticket. Oh, now. The son inherits, property and debts alike. How much? Six dollars. Six dollars. Grilled squid. Why isn't Lung here yet? I think he's coming. - It's 21:35, I want to see the ads. - Why the advertisments? - I want to see the trailers. - Why the trailers? - I want to see the movie! - Why the movie? - Why the movie? - Why do you want to see it? - All right, then I'll leave. - Why? Stop it, won't you? Is Lung always late? Only occasionally. Then he's done it before. I didn't say that, you do. I think he's not coming. No, maybe it's just his bad old habit. What bad habit? I won't say anything to hurt him. Go on, finish what you were saying. Right. Lung thinks one should treat girls like children. No spoiling, whatsoever. Must be late on the first date. And practise it on every date. Then the girl will be tamed. I didn't practise it on you, though. You've got to trust me. Tak, what are you doing? Looking at him. Oh, please, can't you two talk it out? Alright, ask him why did he bump into my back? He wants to know why you bumped into him. Tell him that I didn't. He said he didn't. Then why is he staring at me? Why are you staring at him? Tell him I didn't. Why he is looking at me? He said he didn't, why are you looking at him? Alright, it's a misunderstanding. Let's not look at each other. Hurry. Walk fast. What do we do now? We go to Lung's place, see what's he doing. We'd better leave here fast. Start moving. Don't move. Bastards. Start moving. Get in the car. Get in the car. There's a man here. Don't go, the police can't see you. - Why? - Because you're dead, see? Hurry, we are running out of time. Where are you taking me? To the place where you belong, let's go. Lung isn't inside, I'll get in from the back. Good. It's useless to find him now, the time has passed. Yeah. Are you here, Lung? Of course not, you just don't believe me. I study logic since pre-school. You see whether he's in his room or not. Tak. What are you two doing here? Nothing? She is bored, really. - What? - Really. Will he be in the living room? Where? Where is Ah Lung? Where? Have you seen Ah Lung? Have you seen him? Where? You are standing in my way. Where? Where is Ah Lung? I don't get it, have you seen Ah Lung? I see your face only, can you please make way? Go check the washroom. Anything wrong in there? Nothing, nobody in there. He's not here anyway, let's go. Crazy. Ah Ling, are you not coming? - Let's go together. - Alright. Be careful. Don't stop me. Whose legs are these? Lung's. No, his father's. No, mine. Oh, they're really Lung's. Lung, why are you holding my hand? He's got a fever, poor guy. His stomach is cold, must be stomach-ache. What? I can't hear you. He said he is very sick, won't you excuse him. Not necessary, I'm leaving now. Lok, don't go, let him sleep. Oh, do I need to sing him a lullaby? A woman should be tender and considerate. - Many were dumped for not being so. - I don't care. He just can't ignore me like this. Lok, Lung isn't this kind of person. I know him, we grew up together. Maybe he is tired. I must wake him up. Lung, wake up, stop pretending. Wake up, Lung. Wake up. Why are you people here? Let's go to a movie. Movie! It's over already, where have you been? No, I didn't go anywhere. I didn't know why I fell asleep. Asleep! You wouldn't wake up, even when I kicked you. Ah Lok! You're having fun. You even forgot to come for the movie. Lok, I didn't mean it. I had a dream. I dreamt I was in hell. How interesting. Not a story, I always have the same dream. - It must be fun there in hell... - Excuse me. The environment there, is very strange. Listen to me. Say anything you like. Shut your mouth get out. It's true, I can hear my father's voice. He asked me to succeed him and be a messenger of Death. You are being far out, how can I help you! It's true, I even collected a soul named Billy in Tai Yau Street. How can I believe the words you say! What you said yesterday is true. Am I a murderer? I think it's just coincidental. Ask your father if I'm under a spell. Why do you trust my father all a sudden! If you don't want to ask him, just forget it. Ling, what do you think? I trust him. Lok, what about you? I trust you, he is your father. You guys confused me now. Then don't ask him. But I always do. Let's go. Come on. It's a good one. Papa, steamed or stew? It's for the god. Lung, put your hand inside. It's a sign of death. It's a symbol of the messenger of Death. Messenger of Death. It's a soul collector. The original messengers found it a hard task. With so many images put up by people. So, they use living souls to work for them. - Is it his turn now? Papa. - No, he volunteers. I didn't. But his ancestors did, keep it in the family. That's why one should lead an honest life. Now you know what this world is full of. You have to watch your steps. What can we do now, papa? Uncle, how can I get away from this? I don't know. You don't know? How come? It's true. Ah Lung. I have to go. Papa, he is just like last time now. I've got to go. The door is over there. I want to have a rest. Alright, leave by the door. What now, papa? Move the altar. Red string. Chicken blood. Uncle... Ah Lung! I feel awful. I feel awful. - He is awake. - Ah Lung. Are you alright, Lung? What have I done? Why do you tie me up? I tell you later. Papa, is he alright now? Not that simple, he's saved temporarily. Uncle, what do we do now? I think we have to talk to his father. My father? Uncle, his father is dead. We can arrange it. Is it E.S.P.? No, it's a seance. Right. Where can we find a conjuror? I know who is the best in town. The best conjuror is my father... Uncle? No, my father's girlfriend auntie Pearl. Auntie Pearl. You bastard. Me? Do I have many sons? Papa. Do you still respect me? Of course, you are the only father I have. Why didn't you succeed at my job properly? I don't want to. You don't have any choice. I have something to discuss with you today. What? Something to do with you? I help Lung to gain back his fetch just now. You think it helps him? I understand that I can't help him twice. Will there be a second time? So, once is enough. Yes, enough to lose his life. Lose his life? I lost my life for not carrying duties as a messenger. Lung is different, he is kind and you're lazy. I died from stopping the others to collect your soul. - Mine? - Whose else? You thought that the doctor saved you? Try to jump down from the Connought Center then. - Uncle... - Don't thank me. I didn't know I would get killed by doing this. I stopped Lung, that means... That means you are killing him. Lung is the only child we have, and now... Father, what are we going to do? Do? Your life is over. Those demons won't let you free. You really do not have any solutions? Not really, you... Don't go. Uncle, don't leave. Father is there any way we can solve it? Give me the answer, father. Fix me up. Who are you? I am the demon. So it's you! I'll teach you a lesson. Pearl! Don't come any closer! I'll kill you tonight, bastard. Pearl, are you alright? I'm fine. We have to fight him, if he comes. Can we avoid it, uncle? Of course, wait to be killed. Master, thank you for your help. It's my pleasure. I'll prepare according to your instructions. I hope this can help Chiu. Thank you, master. Please. Please retire, master. Amida Buddha. All the things are here. Thanks. Ah Lung, you'll have a new life, if you're lucky. You'll have no life at all, if you' re not lucky. That does it, I am doomed. Not exactly, he can lend you a few years of his own life. Nonsense. Lung, if you can start your new life, I... It's not time for fun. Right, we'll talk some other time. When? By sunrise or never. It all depends on you. - Don't say that. - I'm trying to encourage him. I thought ghosts are afraid of charms. We can write charms on Lung's body. Don't forget his ears. Or else his ears will be torn off. Stop joking. Don't do anything useless. What must be done, must be done. I mean it's useless to write charms now. It can work on your body, but not on your soul. It's useless to do such kind of things now. It won't be that simple. Calm down, both men and ghosts have their behaviour pattern. We just have to watch out. What are these? Paper sheets. And if you've printed numbers on them? - Money? - Right, money. Ghosts can be greedy, too. If that doesn't work? Then we have to go rough. Go rough with a ghost? Sure, if it doesn't give up. So what if it doesn't care? One cannot lose his face. No matter what, we don't give a damn. Good, we fight it till death. Yes, we must stick together. You sit here and watch this needle carefully. This tiny needle? No excuse for me, if I can't fulfill my duties. Clasp hands, and sit cross-legged. Tak, Lung's father died for you. You do the bargaining with the ghost later. I've already bought the paper sheets. Everybody can do that. Everybody can bargain with ghosts, too. Allow me, uncle. Be ready, the ghost will appear by 12 o'clock. Then the stone grinder will start to turn. Why? It's the ghost's habit. Start to burn the paper at that time. Slowly, piece by piece. He can't stop, unless you stop. Make it last till the sun comes out. What if I make a mistake? Then you will be possessed, and kill Lung. Why him but not you? Yes, we are also at risk. But, eventually, the ghost will make you kill Lung. Why? Because you'll be the one who burns the paper. Luckily, it won't be me negotiating with it, or else I would be the possessed one. I won't let you kill Lung, I will make you marry him. Let's go first. Concentrate on this needle. Remember. Papa, will everything be alright at sunrise? Yes, ghosts are afraid of sunlight. They will lose their soul when scared. Just like human beings. When its soul is gone, I can trap it. Don't worry, I know how to handle it. I wonder if they're alright. Sure, I only hope Lok can concentrate. Fortunately, I don't have to be in there. You're such a chicken. Lok! Uncle... Lung! Down, all of you! Legs, hands and head, on the floor. Uncle, is it safe this way? We could keep the same position, until sunrise. That won't do. It will get us, eventually. We are in trouble. Especially you. Why me? You were the last one to get down. Right you are! Let's go! Ling, are you alright? Leave! How's everything? Wait! What are you doing here? Are you alright? I am alright, how about you? I am not! Not me, him! Why did you hit me? I'll do it whenever I like. It's me, I am alright. Are you alright? I am alright, where are they? Outside. Follow me. I am okay. Are you okay? I am okay, are you okay? I am okay. Is she okay? I am okay. - Are you okay? - I am okay. The four of us are okay. How about papa? I am over here. Uncle, we are all okay. Are you okay? I am okay, too. How about you? No, I am not! Are you alright? Fine. Tie her up. Listen, no matter which body he possesses, you must use this needle, when roosters crow. Yes. Papa, you've mistaken, it's not me, it's her. Are you alright? I am fine, uncle. Tak, tie her up, too. Why does papa want to tie us all up? You can't be possessed when being tied up. Papa, what about you? Me? Now is the time. Amida Buddha, Amida Buddha. Amida Buddha, Amida Buddha. Amida Buddha, Amida Buddha. Amida Buddha, Amida Buddha. Amida Buddha, Amida Buddha. Amida Buddha. - Hurry, hurry. - Alright. Drive carefully, it's a long way to Tai Po. Don't drop it. - Don't worry. - Hurry. Bye. Almost scared me to death. This is my home. Rice or kiss? You're a good cook. So-so. Where's uncle? You haven't got your pants on! Don't tease auntie. Who hasn't got his pants? Uncle is wearing a suit. I feel so unnatural. Why don't you wear a suit too? The suit he's wearing, belongs to me. Cheers. We score, cheers. Thank you for helping me, uncle and auntie Pearl. A toast for you. It's all your father's blessings. Lok, you said you'll marry Lung, when he's alright. Yeah. You mentioned this because of Ling. Admit it. You feel embarrassed? If you're not, speak out and ask papa to marry you. Right! Hey, your son... My son is your son. Right, take this as your engagement banquet. Cheers! Don't be shy, drink up. Cheers! Have more wine. Eat this. Don't drink too much. Here is the special report. Due to a blackout in the public electricity today, one ton of ice-cream melted on Tai Po highway. China Light is doing its best to restore power. This is the end of special report. I am tired, I'll go to rest. - Papa! - Uncle!
