You may inform the Secretary of the Royal Society that I have entitled my lecture "Darwin's Fundamental Error". That'll raise a few hackles, sir. Will it not? I must be off. You can acknowledge all of these. There's a good chap. Thanks. - Father? - My dear? Did you hear how Roy barked last night? It was dreadful. No, no I didn't. Did you hear him Bennett? I can't say I did, sir. He kept on and on. He howled too. I'm sure someone got into the garden. An intruder? Well yes, because... Oh father. Someone looked in at me, at my window. Impossible. You must have been dreaming. Oh, Edith, nobody could reach your window. It's far too far off the ground. I'm sure I wasn't dreaming. Bennett, you take charge or I shall be late for the faculty meeting. I leave you in your fiancé's care my dear. If he proves as good a husband to you as he has amanuenses to me, you'll be a fortunate woman. Allay her fears Bennett, I know you can. Can you believe me? Not easily, no. I mean as your father said. Come and look. I'm awfully busy with these notes on Simia Satyrus to type, and then the proof of your father's... Jack, I know I wasn't dreaming and you know Roy doesn't bark at nothing. I want you to see for yourself. You must. Please. And then after the barking woke me I heard another sound from just below here. From below? There and there, do you see? The ivy's pulled away. I must have fainted. The next thing I knew it was dawn. You're quite, quite certain you didn't dream this, Edith? Quite. Jack, I insist you believe me. Very well. And that you inform Sherlock Holmes of the facts. Oh, darling. Or I shall reconsider our engagement. But why? I could not give my hand to a man who doubts my word. Watson, come at once if convenient. If inconvenient come all the same. Holmes, I got your note and it is inconvenient. Damned inconvenient. Your old wound is troubling you. No. I prefer to differ, your step was uneven on the stairs. I have a full surgery Holmes. You must excuse a certain abstraction of mind, Watson. I see. It's a tangled scheme. I've been looking for the loose end which might unravel it. One such might reside in the question does Professor Presbury's daughter wake or dream. I'm summoned here for no more than this? You've heard of Presbury? Of course, who hasn't? He's our most distinguished natural scientist. He's a widower with one daughter. She insists someone appeared at her window last night. Miss Presbury's bedroom is on the second floor and is completely inaccessible to even the most agile cat burglar. Read this. It arrived by the 1:00 post. The author already arrives ahead of his time, a most precipitant young man. Mr. Bennett, my friend and colleague Dr. Watson. - How do you do? - Mr. Bennett. - Please sit down. - No, forgive me. Mr. Holmes, I fear I've made a grave error of judgment. I should not have been in touch with you at all. I've wasted your time entirely. It is not a rational reason for Miss Presbury's fears. No, no I can't say that. Well it's, it's a delicate matter but I, I must beg you to proceed no further. I can of course recompense you. Mr. Bennett, your letter was less than frank, was it not? I set out the facts. Not all I suspect. Probably out of loyalty to your fiancé, Miss Presbury? You're aware of that? As I am of your employer's engagement to Miss Alice Morphy, the daughter of the famous comparative anatomist. She resides next door to the Presburys, does she not? How do you know of the engagement? The Times, July the 1st September the 5th respectively. Mr. Holmes' memory is of a photographical order. Quite so. Oh, dear. Mr. Bennett, I do appreciate your predicament. As a scientist and a rationalist yourself. I dare say you're reluctant to accept the evidence insisted upon by Miss Presbury. Further, as a father's trusted assistant to have recourse to me must smack to you of disloyalty. Exactly, I'm part of the family except that Edith... Miss Presbury, she was so upset that she... Mr. Bennett, who would you prefer to alienate, your perspective wife or her celebrated father? You give me a choice of evils, neither. Then furnish me with the facts and I will see how I can help you. You may rely on the discretion of both of us. Well... Would you for example, describe Miss Presbury, as an impressionable fanciful girl? No, quite the reverse. Miss Alice Morphy? Perhaps Professor Presbury's- engagement to her came to you as something of a surprise. He is after all three times her age. And this velour? I prefer that one, with the osprey feathers. Could you ask him, do you think? Father's extremely proud of his orchids. I hate them. They're so, oh I don't know, so impure somehow. Do please ask him not to send them anymore. There's a sweet friend, Edith, please? Can you not ask him? I couldn't. I dare not. I'm such a coward. Oh, please. You've got so much more character than me. You're as strong as he. But Alice, if you dare not ask this of my father, how will you ever manage those deeper conflicts that occur even in the happiest of marriages? Oh, I don't know. I'm so frightened. Of marrying my father? I wish... No, please don't ask. Let's not speak of it. What do you think of this one? Neither Miss Presbury nor I consider her father's- infatuation with Miss Morphy to be entirely appropriate. Rather excessive. And her parents have no objections to the marriage? The professor is a respectable widower. And a wealthy man. When may I call? Call? To view Miss Presbury's window, to determine for myself its accessibility and otherwise to an intruder. Shall we say 11:00 tomorrow morning? Professor Presbury will be at his college. That's of no matter. At present my inquiries are purely logistical. I have never had any secrets from the professor. Mr. Bennett, let me refer you to your first question which you have in fact answered. You're more inclined to Miss Presbury's party than you are to your employer's. Yes, yes, I dare say. Thank you. Good day. Good day. Holmes, you're prying into the affairs of a perfectly respectable family. Why is Bennett so reluctant to tell the truth? Loyalty. It is as plain as a pack staff. Let us hope so. Yet he wrote to me under duress. You notice his handwriting, the crossing of the T's with such deep indentation? And then upon his arrival his endeavors to call the whole thing off, no, there's more to this than meets the eye. I do not agree. This case is unworthy of you. I must return to my surgery. Maybe I'll see you tomorrow. Father? My dear. I trust you slept better? Oh, yes. Last night I moved to the guest bedroom. Oh, no need surely. It was but an ugly dream. Father, Alice has asked me... Yes? The truth is she does not care for orchids. She doesn't? Well, why did she not say so? Well, she was afraid to. You forget how formidable you are father. The silly girl. Well, then she shall have roses. Yes, two dozen red roses. Roy was quiet enough last night. Not to rouse him, sir. Docility itself... Aye, he's grown accustomed to his shackles. The poor beast. Shall we go up? If Miss Presbury has no objection. I understand the necessity. Let us lead the way my dear. I'm glad you're more yourself today, Watson. You were a veritable bear yesterday. A touch liverish perhaps. This is where the figure appeared? Yes. There's no ladder on the premises that could reach this height? No. Was the window ajar? Yes, I keep the door locked. Did the hand touch the windowpane? I don't know. I fainted. Of course you did. Of course you did. Well, that's a formidable elevation, yet the ivy's strong, Hedera algeriensis, torn away just here. Miss Presbury, your father has returned prematurely. Oh, no. He mustn't know you're here Mr. Holmes. That can scarcely be avoided. However, let us go down. The backstairs? Certainly not. Bennett, what did you do with my lecture? Who the devil are you, sir? Father, I'm sorry. Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Who? The detective. Professor Presbury, my card. 221B, hardly an address to inspire confidence. I have never sought to inspire confidence in others. I have quite enough of my own. May I introduce my colleague Dr. Watson? Certainly not, you may leave at once the pair of you. Father, they are here at our request. But not mine, Edith. And you Bennett, you should have consulted me before resorting to such methods, a common detective and his accomplice, really. Now, sir, allow me to escort you from the premises. My assistant had no authority to engage you in this matter. Kindly inquire into it no further. Should you persist I shall have no hesitation in calling the police. Lestrade of Yard is well known to me so beware. I would hesitate in calling Lestrade, professor, if you wish to have the mystery solved. There is no mystery, sir, none. Now be gone with you or would you have me release my dog? Believe me he'll not distinguish between a hired snoop and an intruder. Will you be gone, sir, will you? We shall, sir, we shall but you are over the mark. Kindly watch your words. As a breed. Despite their ferocious appearance these dogs are seldom vicious. I'm surprised that Roy needs chaining at all unless it is for your safety as much as ours. The dog reflects family life Watson. Does it indeed. Whoever heard of a frisky dog in a gloomy home or a sad dog in a happy one? Snarling people have snarling dogs. You observed the Presbury's Irish Wolfhound as well as I. He growled quite as much at his master as it did at us, two complete strangers. That animal did not reserve its animosity solely for the professor. We'll seek verification from young Bennett when he arrives. I sent word by way of Jock MacPhail after our meeting at the Goat and Compasses. Another of your agents Holmes? The Presburys' coachman. He has charge of Roy. I joined him last night for what he calls a wee Goldie. Here's Bennett, precipitous as ever. Come in. Good morning. Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I must apologize for your unfortunate encounter yesterday, but also... There's no need. In fact, it has provided the very first clue to this odd affair. Do sit down. Thank you. Mr. Holmes, I cannot pretend that I am happy to have answered your summons. Of course and I continue to appreciate the division of your loyalties. It's no small wonder that you've withheld so much. Roy first attacked his master on the evening of September the 2nd, did he not? How can you know that? As the professor came from his study into the hall, he restrained the dog. On this occasion he was merely shut up in the scullery. The next morning he was as right as rain or so MacPhail informs me. MacPhail? Who better than the family coachman to advise me how matters might truly stand? Forgive me Mr. Holmes, I should have told you myself but... But you didn't. The second attack occurred 13 days later. Again, the professor was in the hall. Fortunately this time he was able to put the study door between himself and the altered animal, was he not? Edith wanted Roy chained from that moment. But her father overruled her. He insisted that he was still a dear affectionate dog, that he wasn't congenially vicious. But not after the third attack? No, he did agree then that he had to be restrained. And Roy was banished to the chain in the stable yard. Yes. MacPhail believes that the change in Roy's behavior stems from about two months ago? I think it may have. I, I didn't keep a straight note of it. Consult your fiancé Bennett and MacPhail. A precise log of these events may yet prove pertinent, I observed that the professor lectures at the university at 2:00 this afternoon. I shall call then. No, I couldn't possibly agree, no. Bennett, Miss Presbury did not dream. Someone or something looked in upon her. It is my conviction that your fiancé is in grave danger. From whom? No, sir, from whom or from what. As secretary you handle the professor's correspondence. Oh yes, it's my responsibility to open every letter. Has it always been Miss Presbury's habit to lock her bedroom door at night? Urn, no, well it, well she told me that... Yes? It was after Roy began to behave so strangely. That she too became afraid of the dog? Mr. Holmes, you mustn't touch his desk. Bennett! Thank you. Inform me of the correspondence the professor had with someone called Dorak inhabiting "Cornmead". No, no, no, Commercial Road of course E.C. It would appear that the professor answers such correspondence himself. Well, again... Again, you've been reluctant to speak. Yes. Some eight weeks ago he told me that certain missives might arrive from East Central marked by a cross under the stamp. A code? And did they regularly? Irregularly, I was to leave them unopened and speak of them to no one. You said missive. They were not letters. Well, some were, others were small packets. And did you observe Professor Presbury's replies? No. They didn't pass through my hands. Yet the evidence would suggest that he did respond. To the Hindu the dog is a traditional enemy of the monkey. What was that Watson? What? Nothing. Jack? Oh, I, I wasn't aware. No, I couldn't tell you, you'd already gone out. I see. I've invited Alice to take tea with us. Do not be too severe upon your fiance Miss Presbury. He has acted for the best. And please will you continue to lock your door at night. The prowler who looked in upon you is no ordinary creature. Good day. Jack, you shouldn't have brought him in here. I didn't want to but he insisted. He says there's grave danger. Was that Sherlock Holmes? The Sherlock Holmes? Your observation goes to the very heart of this business Watson. Observation? Considering the monkey and the dog, the very heart of it. Oh, you think so? Now if you'd be so kind as to accompany me to the university, you can drive on to the Commercial Road, inquire after Dorak. That's not an address Holmes. The Commercial Road is a mile long from Aldgate east to Limehouse. We'll ask a custom monger where Dorak's shop. Shop? Come on Watson, I'm going to be late. The equatorial rain forests of Africa, Asia and Southern America are filled with the sound and movement of a multitude of species from the primate family. ...therefore, this physical activity the swinging amongst branches, the flying leaps from treetop to treetop and loud raucous calling not only defines territorial rights in the forest. For example for food gathering, the tender shoots of tree and shrub are particularly prized but also is frequently among the males a ritual display either to ward off unwelcome intruders or to impress a particular female with a sexual potential of the performer. Thank you, gentlemen. Good afternoon, looking for somebody are ya? I believe there's some livery stables here or nearby. No, no, we got a knacker's Yard next door, that's all. Oh, right, right you are. It's a dead end. Oh, I could see a way through, yes. You're a nark or what? Not at all. Out. - I'm sorry. - I said out. You just can't take it in, can you? I beg your pardon? I said out and I meant out. No admittance, mate. These are commercial premises. What do you mean by that? I mean it's a shop. It must be early closing day. This is ridiculous. Is it? My dear Lestrade, I'm astonished that you- a man of your standing should call upon so petty an errand. Professor Presbury objects most strenuously to your investigations, Mr. Holmes. His complaint is that of unjustified harassment. The justification has yet to be proved. Has Presbury informed you of the facts? Of course. And your conclusions? A girl half asleep, mistook a cat or a bird or both for an intruder. That's all. It's trifle. Such a simple explanation, however, it begs the question of the family dog, does it not? Does it? What dog? Presbury did not mention Roy's part in this affair is strange. Clearly a partial witness. I suggest you ask him. You're not in full possession of the facts of this complex case. Trust you to say there's more to it than meets the eye, Mr. Holmes. I never concern myself in anything without that stimulus. If you persist you may find yourself at the wrong end of a private prosecution you know. Professor Presbury is a determined man. Then we're fairly matched, are we not? I knew it. Well, I've said my say. Mr. Holmes. Lestrade. - Right, you can do it? - Yeah. Easier than Maidstone. Poor old fellow. 144, Commercial Road. Oh, you located, Dorak, good. He appears to run a general store as far as I can tell. Sells everything from flatirons to fishhooks. Can you be more specific? Well, can't be a very prosperous business. Why not? Because the general public are not allowed in. Did you discover anything else? Apart from being threatened by an unhelpful brute in an alley at the side, very little. He obviously works there because he followed me back to the shop and threatened me again. Oh, there was another fellow sharply dressed, a waistcoat with a mustache. A Cheroot? Yes, yes, he did. Sounds like Harry Wilcox, more usually of Soho Square than the East End. Anything further? Not really, except the smell. There was a very odd smell about the place. Of what? Well it's not easy to say. It belonged to the animal kingdom. Straw or stables? More like a zoo. You're still up. Yes, sir, I thought I might finish these proofs. Very conscientious of you but no, no, you get to bed. I'd rather not, sir, I should like... Get to bed. Go on with you. Yes, sir, very well. Good night, sir. Good night. Darling wake up, it's me. Edith? - Who is it? - It's me, open the door. What is it? I saw. I can't describe. Oh, the intruder. We must rouse your father. Professor Presbury? Father? Sir, sir. Both of you, what is it? Jack thought he saw... I fancied I, I heard an intruder, sir. You did? Yes, Roy too was exercised but when I looked out just now there was- nothing and he since quieted down. Listen. But you thought you saw... Yes, I thought I saw... Yes? An animal. An animal? No, it must have been a trick of the light, sir. Must have been, yes, sir, I was mistaken. My apologies. Good night. Bennett. Yes, sir. Get some sleep. There's a good chap. Yes, sir. Of course. Watson. Watson. Watson. Unofficially a gang is at work. Other zoological gardens have reported similar thefts? Oh, yeah, my colleagues in Driscoll are investigating the theft of- two rhesus monkeys and a baboon removed only last week. A traveling menagerie in Oxfordshire lost a prized chimpanzee and Maidstone, their finest gorilla. Big Charlie? Delightful chap. I knew him well. Well, they've all disappeared without a trace. And Mr. Holmes, what's his interest? He insisted to me that this may have relevance to another case he has in hand. We like to indulge him when we can. Find anything to the purpose, Mr. Holmes? Nothing much. I warned you, my men have been through it with a tooth comb. The lock was released by Jenkins of Stepping Green. The primate was quieted with a pad of chloroform administered by someone who lavishes their hair with Mr. Brewster of Jermyn Street's Pomade. This would suggest that he also sports a waxed mustache, Mr. Brewster being celebrated for his cosmetic wax for gentlemen. If this was so Lestrade, you could do worse than have a word with Harry the Tech Wilcox of Soho. Good lord Holmes, you're nothing much would be anyone else a great deal. Yes, well I'm sure my men will arrive at the same conclusion once their reports are in hand. You will also naturally have noticed Lestrade that this is the sixth reported theft of a mature male primate in as many weeks. Is it six? Good lord, exceptional. The gender of the animals removed is I suggest of the essence. Good day. Come in. My dearest Alice. I'm not interrupting your work? No, no. I wasn't seriously engaged, just some notes of future inquiry, nothing more. Shall we go to the drawing room? This is hardly the place to entertain a young lady. No. Oh, dear. My dear child, what is the matter? I ought to have said before. Ought to what? There, you must take it back. But Alice... I can't marry you. I shouldn't have said I would, but I was afraid to say no. Please take it back. Nonsense, this is simply... No, you must take it. There, I'm sorry. - Alice. - No. You're old. You're too old. So, Bennett actually saw the intruders shadow inside the house. But upon investigation could find no further trace. You must get this to him by way of the butcher's boy. Are you coming? Where to? Dorak's Emporium, especially those parts where Jenkins took such pains to guard against you. Are you game? Delighted. You go armed? Always carry a firearm east of Aldgate, Watson. It's as I feared. He was reckoning on a visit, Mr. Holmes. Wilcox! And Jenkins. By heavens Holmes, this is what I smelt. These are Dorak's patients, poor abused creatures. Have you observed the experiments that Dorak performs on them? Oh, no that's none of our business he says. Well count yourself fortunate that the process has been kept from you. Now gentlemen in you go. In there with him? Why? To await the police. In gentlemen. I should advise Inspector Lestrade at once. You can't leave us in here. Remember the gorilla is a social animal and if you both mind your manners you will do well enough I dare say. Mr. Bennett and Miss Presbury. Yes. I decided I had to accompany Jack, Mr. Holmes. I'm delighted. Have you brought the list of missing dates? Yes, Roy also barked on these nights. Please never mind that Mr. Holmes. We have far more urgent matters to impart. Is that so? Miss Morphy has renounced my father. She's returned his ring? Today. Since when he has remained locked in his study. Every time I've knocked he's shouted abuse at me, we fear... The logic of it Watson, of this progression, do you see it? Please. The first three occasions are self-evident. We know of those. What happened on the 5th of October? Roy barked all night, on the 12th too. They're also days upon which the professor received packages from London East Central. This is the date on which the face appeared - at the window four nights ago? - Yes. And this is where the shadow appeared last night. Of course! The common factor is two. Always the gap decreases by two days. Numskull, Holmes. And today is the 21st of October. Did? Yes, a package arrived this morning. And the crisis is upon us. Last night was but the precursor. Come, we must go at once. Come along, come along, I'll explain on the way. The front door is open. Bennett, examine upstairs. Watson. I thought as much. Did you hear Mr. Holmes? Too well, Miss Presbury, too well. Up there, look. My heavens Holmes, you were right. He's headed across to Miss Morphy's house. Bennett stay here and protect Miss Presbury. He's aiming for that balcony. It's locked. Then, we must housebreak. The dog Watson, the dog. Stay away. Please keep away. It was a close thing. Just missed the carotid artery. Is he all right? He'll live. A reformed man I have no doubt after his experience. My dear Lestrade. I quite intended you to have the credit but to complete the case against Dorak, Wilcox and Jenkins, you'll need this. Here is the incontrovertible proof that those animals you've rescued from degradation were stolen for the sake of their glands. The animal extract was sold at an enormous profit to those foolish or desperate enough to imagine that a course of serum could restore their lost vitality without any other effects. I am grateful to you Mr. Holmes. Thanks to you we've traced the evil to its source. Perhaps, but poor Presbury. When one tries to rise above nature, one is liable to fall below it. The highest type of man may revert to the animal when he leaves the straight road of destiny. Yes, well I'll leave the philosophy to you Mr. Holmes. Quite the best Lestrade, I always do. Is the Wolfhound to be destroyed? Oh, no. No it was the monkey that Roy attacked, not the man. But the dog will be himself again quite as much as his master. Well, thank you both. Good day, gentlemen. Good day Lestrade. If I my say so Holmes I think you went a little too far in allowing Lestrade all the credit. Not all Watson. You can file it away in our archives. One day the entire truth can be told.
