Fire! Take her down. Increment and initialize. Phase one commencing. Hello? Move the pencil. What? Move the pencil. Complete this task within the allotted time. Wait. Where am I? Begin. Begin? Begin what? There. I moved it. Task complete. Now tell me... Increment and initialize. No, no, no, no! What is this? Move the pencil. What? The pencil? Complete this task within the allotted time. Wait. What am I doing here? What do you want from me? Complete this task within the allotted time. I'm chained to a chair. Hey! Let me out of here! Let me out of here! Please! If the task is not completed within acceptable parameters, your daughter will die. My daughter. Eve! Shh. Stop! Stop! Wait! Why do you have my daughter? Eve! Eve! What do you want from me? What do you want from me! Okay. Okay. Fuck! Fuck. Come on! Ah. I did it. Task complete. No! Wait! Eve? Are you okay? Mhm. What are you doing? Shh. The sand is singing. Come on, Mommy. Ah. Ah... Hey. Hey! Ah! What did you do to me? Hey! I'm talking to you! Just tell me what you want. Please. I just want out of here. Please let me out. Just please. Let me out. Increment and initialize. If you tell me to- Move the pencil. Go fuck yourself. Hello? Move the pencil. No! If the task is not completed within acceptable parameters, Eve will die. You leave her out of this. She's just a child. If the task is not completed within acceptable parameters, Eve will die. I want to talk to her. That is not possible. Then make it possible. If I don't talk to my daughter right this second, you're not gonna get another thing from me.. Stand by. Mommy? Is that you? Oh my God, Eve. Eve. Mommy! Eve, baby, did they hurt you? Are you okay? Mommy? I'm scared. I want to go home. Eve will remain unharmed provided you comply. Move the pencil. Fine. I'll move the fucking... Pencil. What? Come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on. What am I supposed to do? What do you want from me? I can't. Move! Move! Move, God damn it! Move! Task complete. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! Are you gonna help me, Mommy? Evie, baby? Mhm? What's going on here? We're building a castle. Right. Right. Eileen. Eileen! What? Eileen. Where are we? Oh my God. - No, get away. - Are you okay? - Get away from me. - Hey, just relax. - Get away from me! - Calm down, it's me. - Get away from- - Ow! Jesus Christ! Eileen, it's me, it's Roger. Fuck. Roger? Roger? You're my husband. You don't remember? Have you lost your mind? Roger. Yeah. Yeah. I don't... Roger, I don't... It's okay. I don't know what's going on. It's okay. Yeah, I don't know what's going on. It's okay, it's okay, just breathe. Yeah. Wait. What? What are you doing here? How are you here? I don't know. I can't remember. Why can't I remember? What happened to you? Why are you in this chair? I just keep waking up here, and this voice, it tells me to do things. A voice? Yes, Roger, a voice. She, it. It said that if I don't do what she says then... Then what? Eileen? She has her. She? You're not listening, The voice. I'm trying. I'm trying to listen. She said that if we don't do what she says, she's gonna kill her. - Kill who? - Eve! Okay, wait a second. Let's go back to the beginning. This voice. What did she say exactly? She said "Move the pencil or Eve will die." "Move the pencil or Eve will..." What the fuck does Eve have to do with a God damn pencil? It doesn't matter. We need to do something. I know, I'm just having a hard time wrapping my head around... How do you even know they have Eve? Because I talked to her, Roger. I talked to Eve. They have our baby. Okay, okay, okay. It's okay. There's gotta be a rational explanation for this. Increment and initialize. Who is this? Grab the pencil. We're not doing anything until you tell us what's going on. Complete this task within the allotted time. Hey! I'm talking to you! I want to speak with my daughter. What the hell is this? Another test. Well, what are we supposed to do? And what happens when that runs out? Eileen, you gotta tell me what's going on. There's no time. Okay, look. If they're gonna hurt Eve, then we need to figure this out together, okay? Now tell me, what the fuck is that? I told you. When it runs out, they kill Eve. This doesn't make any sense! Why would they want to hurt Eve? It doesn't matter! Either help me figure this out, or shut up. Okay, okay. She said "Break the pencil." What does that mean? I don't know! I guess we break the pencil! Only the primary subject can complete the task. You mean Eileen? Only the primary subject can complete the task. Yeah, I heard you the first time, but she's bolted to a fucking chair. Reset all test materials. Only the primary subject can complete the task. If the task is not completed within acceptable parameters, Eve will die. I'm not taking any fucking orders from a God damn answering machine. Roger, just put it back! Reset all test materials. What are you doing? I'm trying to get you out of this chair. No, it's bolted to the ground. Okay, you said they made you do things before. What did you do the last time? How'd you get out last time? - I don't know, I don't know. I just knew, I just found a way. Like what? I don't know, stop yelling at me! Then do something! I'm trying, just let me think! I'm letting you think! Right, you want me to move it with my mind? Fuck, here you go with the God damn sarcasm. I just want you to be practical. I don't know, maybe I can bring you the pencil. We're running out of time! Roger, shut the fuck up! Task complete. What did she do? What did you do? Oh my God, Eileen. Roger? Roger? Oh, good. You're alive. What are you doing? Looking for a way out of here. A door of some kind. You're wasting your time. How'd that get in here? We're in here. There's gotta be a door. Even if you find a way out, I... We're gonna find her. Oh yeah. We'll find her. I don't know. So you think we should just play along? I think we should do as we're told. And you think they're just gonna give her back to us after what just happened? What just happened? The thing with the pencil. Roger... I saw you do it. I didn't do anything. I was standing right there. It's a trick. This whole thing is a sick joke. No. It's called psychokinesis. Jesus. I'm serious, it's a real thing. Like Uri Geller, the spoon man. That was bullshit. Yeah, that's what they want you to think. The government, MK-Ultra, they're always- Do you even listen to yourself? Making up this kind of shit and hiding it. Okay, you think a secret organization has wiped my memory, kidnapped our daughter, and is experimenting on us? Not on us, on you. Have you ever experienced lost time? Oh my God. I'm serious. What if you really have these powers? It would explain a lot of things. I mean, do you remember the mirror that fell? No. We had a big fight around the time Eve was born. I don't remember. You screamed at me about something or other, and my mother's antique mirror fell off the wall at the exact same time, and shattered all around me. We fought a lot. Didn't we? We had our moments. Ugh. Whoa, whoa, whoa, take it easy. I'm fine. - Just let me help. - I said I'm fine. I just... I just need a drink. Yeah. You and me both. No, I just... I just... You gotta admit... Something real fuckin' weird going on here. Yeah. This... What's the last thing you remember? What? - Nothing. What is it? You remember something, don't you? Maybe. No, I don't know. You need to eat something. I'm not hungry. Get your strength back. Come on, would you just work with me? If not for me, then for Eve? Not now, Roger, please. If not now, then when? After they kill her? After they kill our daughter? Stop it! No, I want to sleep. I need to sleep. Mommy? Why do you look so tired? I don't know, honey. You keep going away. I know. I want to stay. You have to play with me. I know. I want to, things just keep getting in the way. Sit up. Okay. What are we gonna build? A sandcastle. Gotta do it like this. Do you think Daddy wants to play too? Daddy? Eve? Eve! Eve! Eve! Eve! No! Eve! Eve! - Whoa, whoa, whoa, it's okay. - Eve! It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay. It's just a dream. Okay. Just a dream. How long was I out? It's hard to say. Ah, fuck! What is it? Nothing. My head's killing me. Let me take a look. No, don't. Just wanna help. Come here. Let me see. Oh. Yeah, there's definitely something under the skin there. Feels warm. Increment and initialize. Phase two commencing. Put the ball in the bucket. How many more of these God damn tests are there? Complete this test within the allotted time. Answer the question! If the task is not completed within acceptable parameters- - Tell me! - Eileen. Your daughter will die. Just do what she says. Go ahead. Do it. Do what? Put the ball in the bucket. This is insane. Just try. Fuck, this is stupid! What happened? Nothing. Nothing fucking happened. Okay, you just need to focus. Try harder. Oh, so you're an authority on how this works now? Okay, this isn't the time. Okay, you can do this. You moved the pencil. You know you can do this. Even if I did, which I'm not saying I did, how am I supposed to control it? I don't know. No shit. Fuck, okay. Okay. What are you doing? I'm trying to get you out of this chair. We tried that already. Maybe we can loosen these bolts. How? With your power. Come on. Eileen, that pencil snapped. That tray of food flew out of my hand. Now, you have an ability, and you need to use it, Eileen. We have a little more than a minute left to work a miracle. So either you want to save Eve, or you don't. Eileen. Okay. Okay. I'll try. If you can unscrew the chair, then I can move you closer to the table. The table. The table. Is it bolted down? Yeah. Yeah. Just like the chair. Bigger or smaller? Smaller, much smaller. Okay. I felt something. Holy shit. It moved. Yeah, I can't describe it. It's cold, hard. I can feel it in my fingers, but only in my mind. Try again. You're doing it. You're doing it. Eileen, you're doing it. That's one leg. That's two. Just one more. Got it! Come on, come on, come on. Last screw. Push! Holy fuck. Come on, push! I'm trying! Task complete. Are you okay? Yeah. Look, Eileen. It's fine. No. It's not. I'm sorry. Really, I am. I was out of line. We're in here together and... I was really only thinking about myself. So, what do you say? Forgive me? Good. Good. So, when was the last time you ate anything? Lucky for you, because Chef Roger is at your service, hm? Oh God, not the French guy. Mhm. You used to make Eve laugh with this. Ah, good. You're remembering. What else? The beach. The beach? We took Eve to the beach. That's right. It was her birthday. Eve loved the beach. That's it. You, Eve, the beach. The rest is all gone again. Maybe that thing in your head is blocking it out. So, what do you think it all means? I don't know. Well... Either way... It's good to hold on to what you have. Eve, the good stuff. If it's still in there and we keep trying then maybe we can have that again one day. You, me, Eve. The beach can come too. You're right, you know. I haven't heard you say that in a long time. You probably haven't been right in a long time. Turn the page. Fill the bucket. Spin the bottle. Build a castle. Task complete. I think you need to put in the sear spring first. That's not the sear spring. That's not it either. Just tell me which one it is. Thank you. Next? Grip safety. You know, this might go faster if you organize the pieces first. No, it would go faster if you just told me what piece goes where instead of trying to... Trying to? Nothing. Just let me do this myself, I don't need your help. Fine, whatever. Typical. Why this? Because you're not helping. No, no, no, I mean, why a gun? It doesn't make any sense. Does any of this make any sense? Yeah, sand, balls, pails, shovels. That's Eve and the beach, I get it, that's- Stop it. These are emotional triggers, maybe those feelings somehow amplify your abilities, but this? Why do they want you to learn this? How to use a weapon? I mean, we know why they're testing you, we just don't know what they want from you. It doesn't matter what they want. Now let me focus. That's not where it- God, you're such a control freak. I'm just trying to help. Help me what? Go insane? Help you control this. Funny. You, an expert on control. Funny, you calling me a freak. What did you say? Forget it. No, call me a freak again. I said drop it. You said drop it. Then I guess the matter's dropped now, isn't it? I don't know what's worse. Being stuck in this room, or being stuck in it with you. Oh, God, here we go. I need a fucking- You need a what? Need a drink? Great idea. Maybe you could pass out and I would focus. Well, maybe if you looked at yourself once in a while, you'd understand why I started drinking in the first place. Right, always blaming someone else. Of course it's my fault you're an alcoholic. How do you suddenly remember all of this shit? I thought they erased your memory? Or is that complete bullshit, just like everything else that comes out of your mouth. The only bullshit thing here is your whole attitude. This isn't about me. It's always about you. Oh, fuck you, Eileen! I didn't ask for any of this shit! Okay, okay. We're doing it again. I'm sorry. That sounds familiar. Eileen, I said I'm sorry. Hm, the magic words. "I'm sorry, Eileen. It's just one drink. I'm sorry, Eileen. Sorry, sorry, sorry." Okay. Calm down. I'm very calm. Load the gun, Eileen. Hey, wait a sec. Very good, Eileen. Task complete, test over. Hey. Hey, look at me. We're not here to kill each other, okay? We're here to save our daughter. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We're here to save Eve! Honey, wake up. Task complete. We're never gonna finish this. But it's already so good. Did you do all this by yourself? Daddy said he would help, but he didn't. Oh. Whoops. Daddy's so clumsy sometimes. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi? You okay? I'm cold. I'm so cold. Let's get some food in you. Do you think they're ever gonna let us go? Yeah, sure. Just have to keep fighting. Focus on the future. The future? What we're gonna do when we get Eve back. I just want to hold her, and never let go. Maybe we could start a magic act one day. I'll wear a top hat, you can levitate things from backstage. Roger the Great. Hell. You could bend spoons. How did we meet? You don't remember? I can't figure out what you know and what you don't. It's like she or... The voice or whatever. They only want to show me certain things at certain times. Just pieces. And then they fade, like... Like writing on fogged glass. If I try to force it, I get nothing. I don't even know what I did for work. You were a teacher. Well, studying to be. Oh. What was I studying? Oh... Condensed matter physics. Don't ask me what it is, I have no idea. Just saw the textbooks all over the kitchen table. You were so smart. I'll never know what you wanted with someone like me. Did we meet at school? I was in a rock band. You played? I sang. You seriously don't remember? Just tell me the story. What was the band called? Ocean of Death. That's kind of lame. Yeah. You said that back then too. But you also said you loved the ocean, so. And then Eve came along and I stopped. Not a lot of money in angsty ballads. I wish I could remember any of it. Maybe it's better you don't. I made a lot of mistakes, Eileen. Come on. I let you down many times. Stop. I must've made mistakes too. Oh yeah, you were a pain in the ass. A royal one, sometimes, most of the time. But not all the time. But I always blamed you for my problems. Things seemed good but... It's hot. Did you do that? I... I needed something warm. Huh. Didn't even realize I did it. Condensed matter physics, right? Hm. Roger. I'm sorry. For what? I don't know. I just am. I wish I could remember why. Increment and initialize. Eileen! Eileen! Get up! Eileen! Wake up! Save Roger. Eileen! Wake up! Get me the fuck out of here! Okay, just... Just try and stay calm. Yeah, right. Cool as a fucking cucumber. I can figure this out. Try and stop the sand. Okay, I'll try. What's going on? Eileen! Eileen! I can't! I don't have a lot of fucking time left. I'm gonna fucking die in here! No you're not, I can figure this out. Give me a second. What are you doing! What are you doing? Trying to get a better look! Eileen! It's sealed. It's sealed all around. Can you break it? Let's try. That's a good idea. We can try it together. Okay. Okay. Fucking shit! Okay, we need to try something else. The chair. The chair, I'll try to break it with the chair. I'll count to three. Just fucking break it! What are you doing? Are you kidding me? Pick it up! Get the fucking chair! Pick it up! Why are you stopping? Don't fucking stop! Eileen, save me! Eileen! Eileen, help me! Eileen! Eileen, are you kidding me? Eileen, you can't let me die in here! You gotta keep trying, Eileen, I love you! Eileen! I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Why are you doing this! The task has not been completed within the specified parameters. Fuck you! Wait. No. The task has not been completed within the specified parameters. So that's it? I failed? No. What about Eve? The task has not been completed within the specified parameters. No, no. Wait, please, please, please. Please, I'll... I'll, no, wait, I'll... Please not her, I'll... No, no. Give me another test. Please give me another test, I'll try harder. I promise I'll try harder. I'll do whatever you want. The task has not been completed within the specified parameters. Fuck your parameters! Phase two complete. Come with us. Where's my daughter? Don't make this difficult. Don't let her within critical distance. Fire! Wait. No, no, please. I have a daughter. Wait! They're all like me. They're all like me. They're all like me. They're all like me. They're all like me. Who's like you? They're all like me. They're all like me. They're all like me. They're all like me. They're all like me. See? They're all like me. They're all like me. They're... They're all like me. Fire! Reload! Stop. What the fuck? What the fuck? Eve? Eve! Eve! Give her back to me. Give me back my daughter! Phase three complete. The test cycle has concluded. You mean... I did it? You completed the test cycle. I saved her. I did it. Now, where is she? Let me see her. That is not possible. Why not? You said I completed the test. Eve is gone. Gone? What do you mean gone? Disabling selective memory control. Do you like it, Mommy? I love it. Do you think Daddy wants to play? Okay, tag, you're it! Oh! Now I'm gonna get you! Yeah? Tickle monster! - I'm gonna get you! - Yeah? Yeah? Do you think they're all seagulls over there? Yeah, most of them are. Oh, look at this one flying. Oh. Cool. Hey. We need to clean up. Just 20 more minutes. We're gonna be late. I don't want to have to deal with your mom and her pocket watch. I'm not done with that. It's warm. We have more in the car. I said leave it. Come on, Eileen. You promised. I'm sorry. You're sorry? You're always sorry. Can we not? Not here, not in front of the kid, I just- What? Suddenly you're father of the year? Jesus fuckin' Christ. When, Roger? When will it stop? When will you grow the fuck up? When I wake up happy! How 'bout that? When I'm not fuckin' depressed anymore. How 'bout that? Maybe if you just showed me one ounce of the attention you used to. Just one fucking iota of what you show her. Then I wouldn't wake up in my own house feeling like a fucking prisoner. You're jealous of your own daughter. Shut up, I didn't say that. It is. That is exactly what you- Shut up! You're pathetic. No. It's a dream, she's still out there. Incorrect. Eve did not survive the inciting occurrence. Someone help! But I spoke to her. I spoke to her in the test room. In my dreams, I spoke to her. Reconstructed neural simulations. Emotional triggers used to recreate the inciting occurrence. Why? Why would you show me this? Why would you do this? Memory block removal must occur before reconditioning in storage. Please proceed to reconditioning. After... Will I still remember what I did? You will not. Please proceed to reconditioning. You're leaving, Mommy? I'm sorry. You're not gonna play with me? I can't. I can't leave her. Eve is already gone. I know. But there has to be a way. There is not. Please. Proceed to reconditioning. Your memory of this and your subsequent guilt will be erased. But that means Eve will be erased. In that test room, in my dreams, she's still there. She's waiting for me. This facility only has two functions. Experimentation and reconditioning. Please proceed to- Let me go again. You wish to retest? Yes. Yes, retest. If I can't save her, then at least let me believe that I can. One more time. Please. Please! Permission granted. Prepare for experiment reset. Okay. I'm ready. Increment and initialize. Phase one commencing. Hello? Move the pencil.
