I won't allow you to wear such short skirts that go only down to your knee. We have only two daughters. We can neither rely on the older nor the younger one. Oh my god! Oh my god! I'm dead! Checkmate! You'll be dead! You always lose to me! Oh my god! Do you have to look handsome even when reading a newspaper? - Oh my god! - Oppa! Hey! Oppa! So handsome! He is coming toward me. Damn it! Hey! Hey! Hey you! Shit! Stop it! Are you deaf? Don't you hear me? - What are you doing? - You hit me! I didn't do anything. You're so weird! Move aside! What are you talking about? You hit me! Can you even apologize? Seriously... Who the hell are you? What "mwo-ya"? I don't have time! What? Are you a Korean? We're Korean. You hit people on the road and didn't apologize? This world is in chaos! Honestly, if you weren't a little girl, I'd beat you to death! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey, stop! Damn, I'll be dead! Hey, Oppa, are you okay? Seriously... Where did you go?! You said you wanted something to drink. Drink? This little brat! Don't you know how important this project is to our company?! Sorry, Boss. I know... Last night, I had to stay awake to prepare it, but still I overslept. Are you kidding me? Do you know that this project is our company's life-or-death issue? But honestly, from the beginning, the planning of this project was... not my job. Not mine, Boss. Yes, it's not your job. Because, from now on, you're fired! Get out of my office! I'm so sorry! This is the last time, Boss! Get out! Great! Waiters, more beer! You want to drink to death? Even if you drink a whole case, you've already been fired. Understand? Oh my god, she's driving me crazy. Don't touch your lips! Don't lower yourself! Dao, I know you are so depressed. But because you did it in front of everyone, he was ashamed and fired you. Get it? But... that is not my job. Do you understand? I am a media buyer. Media buyers do not do media planning. I know, I know. That is not your duty. However... I don't know how to explain it. You won't get it, anyway. Come on, cheers! Cheers! Hello? Hello. Vice-President. Next time, you don't have to be so formal. Okay, but I think there is no next time, Boss. You must be very surprised that I called you here. No, I'm used to it. That's my job. Is there a reason why you called me? The media planning for this product, I want you to take responsibility. Responsibility? Right. I have already taken responsibility. I already got fired. Just because you got fired, it doesn't mean the problems are fixed. Am I right? So... But we won't ask you for monetary compensation. Probably... Probably, you... I'll give you one last chance. Really? So... what do I have to do now? Bring Chan Y here. Chan Y? This is Superstar News. Music superstar Chan Young has just successfully finished his tour at major cities in Southeast Asia. Why does he look so familiar? Yes. Peak-a-boo. Grandma! Yes? Are you having insomnia again and looking for company? Right. So lovely! I'm so tired, Grandma. I think I'm wasting my life. Ca Dao. Yes? Wake up. Wake up. I'll give you a present. Here. Wine! A rare wine. Wine the way your grandpa used to like it. I know this wine. Grandpa made it by himself, right? Yes. Drink it, and you will get what you want. Grandpa named you. - Yeah. - Yeah. Here. I'm giving you this because I love you so much. Drink it! Sleep really well! Remember, don't give it to anyone and don't tell anyone. Yes, I know. Only you know this. Okay! Okay! Where will you store it? Here. I will put the "Nhu Y" wine in my bag. (T/N: 'Nhu Y' means how you want it. If you drink, things will be as you want.) No one knows. That's right! I'm so smart. You're so smart! I love you so much! I love you! Finally, I can take a break. - Please, let us go! - Thank you! - Please! - Thanks! Thank you so much, everyone! Mr. Chan Y! Mr. Chan Y! I can do this. I can do this! Hey, stop! - That hurts! - Ah, seriously... - That crazy girl? - The stupid guy? Stop. Nice to meet you again. Chan Y? Come here! Come here, fast! Intending to provoke me then run away? Too frustrating! I... I didn't do anything! Oh my god, everything is a misunderstanding... You know... Yes... Yes... I'm sorry. I... I didn't intend to do that. What are you talking about? I know that you can speak Korean! Speak Korean quickly. Otherwise, I... Calm down! What happened here? We're in public now. Ca Dao... Unn? So Yun? Why do I have to follow you? What? I heard that you came here to meet me. Don't you have anything to say? Say it. I want you to become a promotional model for our company. I want you to become a promotional model for our company. I trust that your reputation will become even more popular and... will I trust that your reputation will become even more popular and... even more popular and... Well, not that... What is the reason I have to follow you? If you have nothing to say, I'll go! Hold on! Please wait a second. I have a present. What's this? Are you kidding me? This is Nhu Y wine. It's precious wine from the areca fruit. It was handmade by my grandpa. Do you think I have free time to play with you? You can take this Nhu Y wine back home, then your whole family can drink it together during Tet. (T/N: Vietnamese New Year) Do you understand? I know it was my fault, that's why I have to be like this. Even so, please don't humiliate my family. And I also made it clear that you should not waste any more of my time. I don't want to get involved with you at all. Please hold on! Please help me this time! If this doesn't work, I will be fired. Thanks to that, you can rest for the long term! So, good luck! So Yun! Let's go. Oppa. It is better if you don't waste time. You should look for another job instead. You are good at giving up, anyway. I will give this to him! Oppa, let's go together. Come in. Tell me the result. Dao failed. Were you serious about that? I thought you just wanted to make a good impression. We knew it would fail from the beginning. Do you think so? Oh... pig! Pig! Pig! Hey! What are you doing? Don't make fun of my friend! Will you guys just get the hell out of here? Wow! She likes pigs. Right. I also like fights. I will finish all three of you. Let's go. Thank you, Dao. You have to be brave to be a captain. Wait a minute. If you want to be a captain, you need to put this on your face. Then you'll be respected by them. Dao, you can do it. Yes, Mr. President! Put Chan Young on the phone right now. Sir, it's Mr. President! Yes? You must help me this time! - Director Guc, that's for sure! - Yeah. Problem is... will it be all right to receive this kind of treatment currently? Hey! No problem! The trainees must have their own training, before they make their debut. Right? My goodness! Our Chan Young is here already. It must be hard for you! Come on! Sit down quickly. - I just came back. What's the matter? - Hey, hey! There's a guest here. Sit down. This is the largest investment group of our company. Do you know President Song? Greet him! Ah, this is Chan Y. You look handsome! Can I go now? Because of jet lag, I'm tired. Kang Chang Young, what is wrong with you? Over all these years, the money I make for you isn't enough? What... this bastard? Let go of me... This bastard! Calm down! Our contract ends next month. You know that already. What? What? If this keeps up... Hey! Hey! And you continue to force the trainees, I won't leave you alone. Nhu Y wine... fulfils your wishes, huh? You're back already, Chan Young? What? Who let you come into my house? Oh, ah, today is your birthday. Who told you to do this thing? You are still here? If you stay here, I will go. Oh, don't. l will go. Goodbye. Goodbye then. What nonsense. It's empty. Never mind. Drink up the alcohol; go to sleep; go with the flow. So bitter! Dao? What's happened to you? What's wrong with you, Dao? Who are you? What's wrong with you? What is this? You're suffering from stress. I think I should go down to cook something for you, then you take the medicine and get better. I've told you many times. If something is wrong, you must tell us. Don't keep worrying about yourself. It will make you sick. Oh my god! What's happened?! What's happened?! Oh, God! What are you doing? Is that So Yul? Why do you call my name so affectionately? Kind of scary... Why are you acting so strange today? Don't worry! I'll help you! But you will be busy today. A meeting with the general director, signing autographs, shooting ads. Get ready quickly. Please?! Oh god, my head. Hey, stupid, what is this? How did I become like this?! I don't know. I'm confused, and it's driving me crazy! Have you not heard the end of your speech? I'm in your body! Turn it back right now. Quickly! Why are you screaming like that? I don't know how. I feel so angry! Are you ready to go? Yeah, no problem. Wait for me. Let's talk about it another time! Hey! Hey! Hello? Oh, now I'm Chan Y. Maybe I can solve it. But... But what will I do with this? Maybe I will quit. This strap first... One... two... three. Whatever! I'm tired! Hey! Have you canceled all your work in Vietnam? About that, I felt I should change it a bit. No way. Do you want to pay a fine? But I must go. Please, Director, please let me go. Please, Director! What are you doing? Why is he not the same as on a normal day? Director! Director, we must move to the next part. Go now. Let's go. Goodbye, Director. Thank you. Director. What has happened to him? So scary! This is your working place? Dao, what are you doing here? You said you'd call me right back, but you didn't. You're ignoring me? Okay. Please take all of your belongings and get away from my eyes! Okay. I'm so annoyed! Say it again. I dare you! Oh, who are you? What? What? What? Don't think because you're fired that it means you can look down on me! This thing talks too much. My mood is not good. Stay away, please. Get out! You, you dare?! Why are you so late? Sorry. I have just talked to the director. Director? What did you say? He said that I can't go to Vietnam. What should we do now? You gave up too soon. What should we do now? Any idea? What is the next appointment? Next appointment? It's... It's an interview. Really? Wait a minute. I have an idea. Yes. What? What? It is my honor to be an ambassador for a Vietnamese company. Please support me on this. I will have a concert. Asshole. That dumbass! You will pay for the things you do. A lot of things must be changed. It's so annoying. Isn't it? What are you doing? Nothing. I wonder... Why do you always touch your lips? Oh? I don't know. Ah... I think I should go to the toilet. Wait for me. I will be quick. Are you sure? It's too easy. I just want that Kang Chang Young to not be able to go on stage. You don't have to do anything difficult. I think the fans will protest. Is that fine? Well, that's good. The more audience that protests, the more reputation he will lose. Please get here faster. Dao! Congratulations! Congratulations that you are back. What? What's happened? Did you come from another planet? You embarrassed our boss. Wasn't it funny? Hey, if I was there, I would witness a funny story. Giang! Yes? Why didn't you bring me the file? Do you want to be fired? Oh no, oh no. The file. This is your file. I'm flying to you, Boss. - Are you kidding me? - No, I'm not. Spreading your wings, really? I feel so annoyed by this company. Oh my god, what the hell are you doing? Why does it look like the old one? No, it's different. Come here faster, please. Do it again! Oh! - Hello. - Please stay away. - Hi. - Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you very much. I like it! Oppa, hurry up. We will be late. Okay. Hurry up! - Bye. - Thank you. Nice to meet you. Thanks, everyone! All right! Yes, Director. I hung up the phone because I had to move to the studio... Don't overdo it. It's a normal thing. Normal? Don't you have a mirror at home? Apples and oranges. What is apples and oranges? Director, I'm sorry. Oppa! Be kind! Oppa! Oppa! You got here faster than I thought. Hi, So Yul. Long time, no see. What? I want to talk with Chan Y. Oh, what do you mean? So Yul, please? What? Ah, okay. Wait? Why is this feeling so similar and yet so strange? Excuse me. Attention, please. I'm so sorry. Please stay away. We should have a meeting. Okay. Okay. I know. We are professional. Okay. I'm so sorry. Please stay away. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Oppa. It's just a star. Don't be jealous. Will we continue the talk? Why did we swap like this? I've thought a lot about it, but I still don't understand. Hey! Use your brain! Why are you shouting at me? I told you, "You must use your brain." In romantic movies, it always has something like eating together, drinking something special, or having an accident. Did we have something like that? What did you say? I don't know. Don't act like that. Let's think again. What happened? I drank alcohol yesterday. Alcohol? Yes, the one you gave me. Như Ý alcohol. At what time? Let me remember. Maybe at 2:00 a.m. Yes. I came back home at midnight. Yes, that's it. That day, I drank it and fell asleep. So it was maybe because of the Như Ý wine. My grandma told me that if you drink it, your wish can become real. I wished I could become a famous person like you. That must be great. I hoped I could take a rest. Is something funny? At least we found the reason. Chan Y, respond to me tomorrow. Right? Hi, Boss. Oh... hi, Mr. Huy! Oh, your Vietnamese is not bad. Oh, I taught him. Just the social communication skills. Let's start the meeting. Okay. Okay. Thank you very much! It's all thanks to Dao. Oh, yes. We're professional. Let's increase her salary! Okay, okay! Money, money! You are a bit excessive. Meet me after everything is done. Have we finished our conversation? Yeah. We should talk to each other. Get out immediately! Dao, do you have any problems with Chan Y? No, no. There is no one inside. Come in. Hey. Let's whisper. Do not let my parents know. They are too fierce. Come in. Geez. Are you an idiot? Which one of us looks more like a robber? Hey, why did you run away? I was scared of being found so I decided to run away. Whose message is it? Why do you read my messages? - Give it back! - Calm down! [Don't forget the date at 7:00 p.m tomorrow- from Huy.] - What's up? - So... Are you two dating? He has treated me like this since our first meeting. Don't pretend. He wouldn't act like this if you disliked him. No, it's not that. I don't have any feelings towards him. I don't know what you are talking about. Let's finish this work first. There is nothing at all. - I know, I know. - Nothing at all. I know. Let's go! - Nothing between us. - I know. Just go! No. Here it is! Oh my god. Where can I find it? I'm bored. God, you startled me. Are you startled? What are you looking for? What? Why do you know that? Are you looking for this? Blah blah blah. Oh god, give it to me. Only one sip. Yes. Only a very small sip. "First the season, then the land." "First the season, then the land"? Are you ready? Yes, right. Drink it first. No. You should drink first. You have to drink first. Why is it still as before?! What is it? Dad? No, don't do it. Anyway, I want to apologize for what happened earlier. At least, you must notify us. Well, he still wouldn't understand even if we tell him. He can understand it, Mom. Because we want to finish this project, we had to rush it. However, we fell asleep. But in the bedroom, a girl... Oh, come on. Today, you seem to be disrespectful. Oh, sorry. It's okay. From the past until now, our family did not intend to... did not intend to... let our daughters marry a foreigner. - It's such a miserable and hard life. - Yeah. We told you. We won't let Dao marry a foreigner. I don't want it, either. Oh my god. We are just friends. Dating him? I'm not crazy. I don't need it. Omo? Chan... Chan? Chan... Ca Dao. Dao. Dao, I miss you so much. I love you so much. I told you, "First the season, then the land." Grandma, this is not my sister. This is "Brother" Chan Young. Mom! Mom! Mom, here's Dao, your granddaughter. He is a guest. A guest! How are you, Grandma? I'm fine. Thank you. Thanks. Grandma, about the idiom "First the season, then the land..." "First the season" means that we have to wait until the right time? What about "then the land"? What does it mean? Grandma, talk to me, please. Ca Dao, what are you talking about? Our home has a guest. You speak so loudly. You will make her feel sad. Mom, sit here. Let's have dinner. I think he also feels hungry. Okay, let's eat. I lost too much energy. Mom, let me do it for you. Let our guest have dinner, Thơ. Here, here. Let our guest have dinner, Thơ. One more. Let's eat. Eat, my daughter. Let's eat. What should we do? You don't need to be like that. If they recognize me, what will I do? I am not guilty of anything. Don't take it out on me! Geez. My grandma has told us to wait so let's try to wait. What is next on the schedule? An interview. Three interviews with advertisement companies. Okay, you should follow my timetable. How about the music concert? It is an important occasion. That is the last thing. We will change again before that. Nothing is for sure! What? I remember, tomorrow night I am going to have dinner with Boss Huy. Oh, you can go everywhere, if you want to go. Me?! Are you kidding me? I am not crazy to hang out with a man! I don't like it. If you don't like him, you can stay here. I must do your work, and you must do my work. I just want to make this situation clear. What's wrong? You, stop here. Stop it. Don't worry. Believe in me. Believe in what? I told you, stop it. Why is it so serious? Do you remember me? I already told you, so annoying! You make me startled. It's just a dinner. Why did you do so much makeup? I told you, it is not because of him. What for? Why? Don't talk too much. Try this. What's this? A Korean girl should drink this for beauty. Oh, it's beautiful! We should be more beautiful. What now? Hey. Let's make your skin beautiful. Stop it! Get out! Let me do makeup for you. - I told you to stop it! - Why? Get out! I'm not talking to you! Why? You must look more beautiful! Fry it. Be careful. How is your job? I think I must ask you this question. How are you doing? How is your job? You seem closer acquainted with Chan Y. Is it just a work relationship? Why do you ask? Yesterday, I saw you two have a talk in the room so I just had to ask about it. What happened? Can you share with me? It was because of you. Let's eat. Okay, I'm so sorry. Here, eat it. But I like this. Like little Dao, strong, kind, and straight. It's not Dao at this time. You have changed since you have been to Korea. It's from our childhood. Forget it. This is my hobby. At that time, because of you. This is not only chewing gum. It builds my dream. You were trying too hard to have this seat (position). It's all because of you. You changed my life. Hey, I... can't remember anything from the past. I also don't know what chewing gum which glues your dream looks like. But it cannot glue us together, because we are a boss and a secretary. Drink it. You don't need to appease me. I never give up. It's up to you. One... Two... Three. Lead on! One more. - Go ahead! - One more. Lead on... - Go ahead, conquer the peak. - Cut! - Go ahead! - Cut! Go ahead! Lead on. A five minute break. Hey, he's gone. Are we done? No, just a five minute break. He is a client. A client? I am really... tired. There's so much work. I don't like that Director. Soyul. Are you tired? But why is my timetable so full? How can you be such a lover of money? No problem, because I like it. Oh. Don't play with your lips! Put your hand down. Oh, that's right. Please! It reminds me of someone. Sorry. Hey, Soyul. Yes. How do you know Dao? Are you two friends? Big Sister Dao, right? We know each other, but it seems it was a long time ago. So the day before, what is the relationship between you two? She is not only a person I hate, but also a person I miss. Oh, Chan Y? Are you ready? Ah, okay, okay. Okay! Hey, Oppa, we should go there. Okay. Come quickly! Come to your company! Why are we here? Let's practice. Practice what? Singing and dancing. You do it. You. Me? Are you crazy? I have to go. Why do you act like that? I just want to help you. Let's try together. We should practice first. I can't do it. I can't dance, and I also can't sing. I will help you. Let's practice. Whatever! I don't know how. On the day of the show, if we aren't changed back, I'll pretend to be sick. I decided. Where will you go? Why would you do that? Anyway, the show is announced. All the fans hope to see Chan Y. I don't want to make them feel disappointed. Oh, really? Just trust me. I said that I will teach you. I know. You agree with me. You must not change your mind! So, where will we start? Thank you. How unexpected! What do you mean? You are so good! You are better than usual trainees! I can also start a band. Actually, I was also a trainee in Korea. Really?! I loved dancing and K-pop so much as a kid! So I decided to come to Korea - to debut. - All of us will have an official debut? Yes! So wonderful! I believed we could do it! Dao! Director wants to talk to you. Just Dao only? Yes. Bye. Oh, who are you? Where's the director? So I ran away from the company. I had heard that he was a sponsor (Sugar Daddy) in the entertainment world. Sponsor? That is why Soyul acts weird like this. You didn't participate in showbiz. That is right. This part is full of bad people... Horrible. That's right. But so far, I feel regret. Regret for what? Well, if I just turned a blind eye, I would have become a main vocalist. Maybe I wouldn't be a normal person like now. That's bullshit. Where did you learn this? Stop. It is so good that you didn't debut. If you had debuted following that method, now you would regret it. It is also good, now. Around me, there have also been a lot of good people. That's right! I also like it a lot, that I'm surrounded by good people. And so are you. I found this in your drawer. Did you write this? What is that? This? I wrote this when my grandpa died. My grandma loves my grandpa so much. So not long after my grandpa's death, my grandma started losing her mind. But looking back, my grandma loved her life and was happy so I wrote this song as a present for her. It's so hot in here! Cool place? Ah! Hey, what? Follow me. Oh, wow! There is a place like this in the company? We also sell food products. Here is the cold storage. Well. That's awesome! Take a minute, and then get back to training. Fighting, we can do it! Hey, but... why are you suddenly interested? You make me scared. Because of your asking for help. Okay. It's settled. Who? Who? Hello? Can I help you? F-Finish. No-Nothing. It's over. It's cold here. I want to leave. Stay here. It's hot outside. Come on! Stand up quickly to keep training. I don't want to leave. Get up! Come on! Geez. Oh! What's going on? Why? Wait, wait! The door won't open. Are you kidding me? I'm telling you the truth. Maybe someone locked it. Hello! Anybody here? What should we do? Hello! Open the door. We are stuck here! Hello! Hello! There are people in here! Hello! Stop! What should we do? Just sit back, calm down, and find a solution. You say something. What can I say? Just say something to keep calm. Whatever? Maybe we won't die here, right? Got to say you are so "graceful." I'm so homesick. Sometimes my family argues so much that we do not look at each other. But it's magical when we are having our meal, and we all eat together. My mom is such a nag. My younger sister is as stubborn as a mule. And I am peevish. Dad always bustled everyone to accommodate him. Women have so much, that's right. Of course. Oh, I'm jealous! Jealous of what? I envy your family. My dad is a businessman. He makes a lot of money. That's why my mom and I were always alone on Lunar New Year's or on our birthday. Mom is like my best friend, or something like that? So... how is Aunt now? My mom died one month before my debut. But why he is alone? Where is her husband? Well, I've heard that he is so busy with his business so he couldn't come. How can you say that? She was a good wife. I don't know. I feel bad for the son. Let's go I can't believe that man didn't appear during three days of my mother's funeral. That's just who he was. So... So he remarried? Yeah. But she doesn't look like a bad woman. When did I say she was a bad person? Oh, no. Because I sense that you hate her. Of course. I just have only one mom. You should talk about yourself. You gave up just for that reason? Gave up your dream? I was very facilitating, but you are so stubborn! I... I don't want to make you angry. I just... want to be a singer. Singer? Your voice is so terrible! You think you are a composer? Do it yourself in your country! So, like that, everything ended. Then... I brought this song from that company to another company. But it was useless. So what? You nearly debuted! Because you have potential! You have talent. You can sing in many places in the world, if you want and have passion enough. What's wrong? Are you afraid people will laugh at you? If your pride is bigger than your passion, you should accept this circumstance. Otherwise, you must try. I'll help you. Dao! Dao! Are you okay?! Dao! Dao! Are you okay? Wake up. Wake up, please. Dao! Get that door open! Hurry! Dao! Dao! - Oppa! - Chan Y! - Chan Y? - Oppa, are you okay? Big Sis, come to your senses! Big Sis! What should we do? Oppa, are you awake? Why did you go there? Where is Chan Y? Is Chan Y not awake yet, either? Chan Y? No. Dao? How about Dao? Why is she still lying down? They said that she is normal. She is sleeping; she will awake later. Really? Because of Dao's hug, you're not in danger. If your body temperature had been lower, you would have died. Ah, I got some stuff to do. Take a rest. I... I'll go to the toilet. Argh. My stomach! Sister Dao? Oh? Maybe we have a lot of things to tell each other. What is that? You are awake! Soyul? How did you know? Not because of my sophistication, but because both of you show it clearly. The two of you. Look. You can't stop touching your lips. You must be careful. Vice Director Huy said that he saw Director Jang in the hallway. What do you mean? I mean that Director Jang is looking into the two of you. This was obviously done by Jang. If so... locking the freezer could also... kill us! Gather more people who side with us. Who can believe our side? There are at least two people. What? Dao! Are you high? Dao, are you okay? You're hiding some secrets from me, right? Take it easy. Speak! How can I explain? Dao? Remember this? Awesome! Darling, more beer! Hey, Dao. Dao! Dao! Hey! Oh, my friend! Oh my, Dao! Oh my god. You are Dao exactly. Get off! What? Why do you hug him so tight? She is Dao. She is my friend. My friend. More beers! That's a lie! Are you crazy about Korean singers? Y-Y-You hug him that tight! No. It's Dao. Dao. Oh, Dao. Wow, you have a six-pack. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey, Director Jang. Everything is preparing well, isn't it? Yes, the reporters are set up adequately. Now, we just need Chan Young not to appear. Good job! I don't appear? Why? Kang Chan Young. My concert. How could I not come? Is that correct, Director Jang? Of course, it is. How are you doing? Fine, of course. Maybe you and I should stop here so... No need to greet each other. Why do you make me embarrassed this way? Oh, really! I'm sorry. If you can't do it, I will. Damn it! Call them. Let's go together. Chan Y! Chan Y! Chan Y! Come on, Chan Y! Dao, you can do it.
