(Dreamlike music) [Narrator] In 1650, the archbishop James Usher, calculating from biblical references, fixed the date of the world's creation to have been in the year 4004 bc. Another dedicated cleric, working independently of the archbishop, not only corroborated his findings but with further scriptural proof, pinpointed not only the year but the exact date and time. 4004 bc, October 23rd, at nine am. That was 4004 bc. Meanwhile, a billion years before, give or take a little (church organ music) [Guide] Here on the left, the museum's dramatic exhibit of life-size statues of man's evolutionary change over millions of years. Ramapithecus, 14 million to 12 million years ago. Australopithecus, five and a half million to two million years ago. Paranthropus, two million to one million years ago, dead end. Advanced australopithecus, two million to one million years ago. Homo erectus, 700,000 to 250,000 years ago. Early homo sapiens, 100,000 years ago. Neanderthal man, 100,000 to 35,000 years ago. Cro-magnon man, 35,000 to 10,000 years ago. (Music box music) (Guns firing in distance) [Arnie] There, it's done. - You're wasting your time. - He doesn't know how to read. He'd have to be able to read. I tell you, you're wasting your time. The president of the united states, how could he run the country and the war if he didn't know how to read? Hm, listen. Dear president, 25 million years ago, when I was swinging in the jungle, it shrunk. I had to come down out of the trees and adapt to the open grassland, where, after considerable hardship and sacrifice, I evolved into man. Now I know there was a slipup somewhere, and you were not informed of this, because you now have us back in the jungle. Very astute. I hereby submit that you have designed a war for apes, and as a member of mankind I am exempt and hereby tender my resignation. Hoping that you and your administration can find bigger and better monkeys to fight its wars, I remain Arnie dickerson. The president musta got the word. I want you guys down the path about 20 feet. Stay hidden there in the trees until you hear the whistle to move out. And don't head out in open ground until you hear the whistle to move out. (Imitating whistle) Think you can get that straight (imitates whistle). Hey, sarge, can you mail this for me? It's my resignation. Sure, I'll get it off your body. (Guns firing in distance) 25 million years, and I'm right back where I started. [Pa] For those of you wishing to tour the museum accompanied by an experienced guide, the tour is leaving immediately from the tour guide desk located on the first floor by the main entrance. (Water splashing) Our tour is about to begin if you'd like to go with us. No. Shut up. I wanna go to a restaurant. When man, the naked ape, finally stood upright, his hands were left free to use weapons. He also had the brain potential to make them. Unlike his ape ancestors, the naked ape's growth to maturity had become a slow growth. Now the act of learning and hunting wasn't all that made up a hunting ape. He had to have genetic help. Basic biological changes in his nature were necessary. In other words, his personality had to be changed biologically as well as psychologically. So, with the aid of eons of time, and natural selection, he remotivated himself from a life of fruit picker, of continuous forest snacks, to a life of hunter, killer, food preparer, somewhat like the pure carnivores, the cat. (Upbeat music) (Apes growling) (Upbeat music) (Hog squealing) (Upbeat music) (Shouting) (Upbeat music) (Shouting) (Upbeat music) The hunt, the kill and the preparation of food each became a separately motivated action, making each an end in itself. Minute-to-minute snacks were out, and big, spaced-out meals were in. Another behavior pattern he had to remotivate was his system of defecation. It had to be spacially organized due to group considerations. Hey, where's Lee? Sergeant, you came back for my letter. Hey, sergeant, did you know that your facial and vocal expressions were developed by the hunting ape more than two million years ago, so's he could communicate and cooperate with his fellow man? Would you quit the shit, dickerson, and tell me where Lee went? Where the hell have you been? Having a private carnivore activity. Smart-ass college bastards. Oh, that does it, that really does it, sergeant. Lee, my letter of resignation, where is it? Oh, I just used it. Please follow the yellow line to exhibit h. We naked apes owe all of our basic sexual qualities to our fruit-picking forest ape ancestors. But these characteristics were drastically modified when we adapted to an open country hunting way of life. The bonding of one male, one female developed. The pair bond, or love, came into being. [Arnie] Lee, I'm gonna write another letter. Dear Mr. President, for millions of years, guys like me have gone off to hunt or to wars, worrying about his woman back home. Then, true love grew into our lives, and gave us males assurance our wives wouldn't have thoughts of other guys, but attend his happy hearth at home, his unassailable haven from the horny, ha ha. Why is it berries always seem riper on another man's bush? This fear, plus the need to stick around until the kids were grown, is why love was developed. (Gasping) Why, I predict, love will prove a much more powerful drive than sex, don't you? (Laughing) I mean, two people won't want anybody else but one another now that we got this pair bond love thing going. I can't imagine anything bigger than that in the picture, can you? Love is where it's at. (Woman moaning) The fellows here are swell. We rap about all sorts of things. But underneath, we're of one mind. I wonder what she's doing now, the girl I left behind. Hell, I know that now that I've developed this very strong pair bond with my girl, my mate, having once done this, I should have no concern about her loyalty or fidelity till I return. (Woman moaning) Except except, as you may have by now detected, there's a creeping doubt this process was ever really perfected. Uh-oh. (Grunting) (Cat roaring) [Cathy] So there he is, our vertical, hunting, territorial, brainy, naked ape. The naked ape is a new, experimental departure, and new models frequently have imperfections. For instance, sexually, the naked ape finds himself today in a somewhat confusing situation. Remember in the middle ages when they put fig leaves on everything? That's so people wouldn't get horny starting at the statues. (Laughs) Yeah. I can get horny staring at space. (Laughing) Let's see. I'll buy these. Got it. I don't need these. I'm gonna buy these. Hey, are you gonna go to your next class? Yeah. I don't know why. I didn't do my assignment. What is it? It's for English lit. I need a quotable passage from a major writer. A quotable passage from a major writer? Why don't you fake it? Oh, that's very good, thanks. She's probably making change with her toes. Yeah. Hey, man, here's a writer with some quotable stuff. That's anthropology, dumdum. It's in English, isn't it? It's English lit. I keep forgetting. Here, look here. First page, he is proud... Who? Man, that he has the biggest brain of all the primates, but attempts to conceal the fact that he also has the biggest penis. Come on, Arnie, she can hear you. Preferring to accord this honor falsely to the mighty gorilla. It's bigger than a gorilla's. Lotta good it's doing me. Yeah, a gorilla probably makes out better. Keep reading, you'll find they don't have nearly as much fun (laughs). You loudmouth dummy. I told you she could hear you. Okay, okay. Look, look, look. Here. You didn't pay for that. No, no, you did. Why you dirty son of a ow. (Laughs) That was worth 95 cents. Oh, man, listen to this. It could be said that the advance of civilization has not so much molded modern sexual behavior as that sexual behavior has molded the shape of civiliza... I can just see myself getting up and quoting that. I don't even know what it means. It means that we evolved from the sexual fruit picker to the sexual hunter. Fruit picker? Wait a minute, I was never no sexual fruit picker. Are you gonna listen to me? I don't know. Well, listen, it look millions of years for us to evolve into the sexual hunter, and then we think up civilization, and pow, man, in a few thousand years we become civilized. Now the point is, there was no time to make the adjustment. Oh, so now I'm a maladjusted sexual fruit picker. No, no, no, you are a maladjusted sexual hunter. Look, don't we have to keep slamming those lids down on our sexual feelings? I mean, if we don't, we're in trouble with society, right? Right. That one I am, I'm a sexual lid slammer. Okay, well, that kind of restraint has got to be learned. I mean, our basic urges don't agree with that. That's because never had the time to make the proper gene switches. You mean, all my basic needs and urges are geared to a few thousand years ago? 25 to 30,000 years ago. Then all those nights in scout camp when I was thinking all those things, I wasn't unclean? You and the rest of the beaver troop were merely reacting to the call of the early sexual hunter. Yeah, beaver. Oh, good hit. I think you better go retrieve your dart. Yeah. Even maladjusted, it still beats early fruit picking. (Bell tolling) Sorry. Oh, sorry. Here. Was I right? Uh, right. (Students murmuring) (Chalk clicking) The popularity of erotic poetry and prose. I imagine you all had a ball finding examples for this assignment. (Class laughing) During every uptight era, the man with the pen seems not only to let himself be free enough to investigate the myriad pleasures afforded by love, but is allowed by society to get away with it in print. Why? Why, if at the same time the cultural code forbids it? It is because one poet's vivid and inventive imagination must serve for the many. He is given license, becoming the symbol of the free spirit, the fulfilled man, a luxury not afforded the masses by reason of their desire to abide by the civilized rule. He becomes a man a hang-up generation envies. And if instead of reading this pornography these hang-up people were to act out their fantasies as healthy animals, the traffic in this literature would drop to nothing. The post office department, the league of decency, various church and veterans organizations would all be grateful, because they would be relieved of a busy schedule of vigilance, making themselves more available to do in their secret shame what the poets encourage we all do in open delight. (Class applauding and whistling) Hold it, hold it, wait, waitjust a minute. We have forgotten one thing. The law. (Student booing) Well it seems that civilization, in its never-ending attempt to curb our animal nature, has devised certain unnatural act laws. Now they even apply, by the way, to unnatural acts between a man and his wife. Now if yours is the normal sex life of the normal American, you could all be arrested. (Class laughing) Let's get to the examples themselves. We'll start over here and go, one after another, right around the room. "To his mistress going to bed," by John dunne. "Full nakedness, all joys are due to thee. "As souls unbodied, bodies unclothed must be "to taste whole joys. "Gems which you women use are like Atlanta's ball "cast in men's views. "That when a fool's eye iighteth on a gem, "his earthly soul might court that, not them." [Professor] Next please. [Woman] "Sappho's ode" by catullus. "My bosom glowed. "The subtle flame ran quick through all my vital frame. "On my dim eyes the darkness hung." [Lee] The pair formation stage, usually referred to as courtship, is remarkably prolonged by animal standards, frequently lasting for weeks or even months. As with many other species, it is characterized by tentative, ambivalent behavior involving conflicts between fear, aggression and sexual attraction. The nervousness and hesitancy are slowly reduced if the mutual sexual signals are strong enough. (Soft music) These involve complex facial expressions, body postures and vocalizations. (Laughing) A courting couple is often referred to as murmuring sweet nothings, and this phase sums up clearly the significance of the tone of voice as opposed to what is being spoken. (Birds cooing) After the initial stages of visual and vocal display, simple body contacts are made. These usually accompany locomotion, which is considerably increased when the pair are together. (Upbeat dance music) Hand to hand. And arm to arm contacts. Followed by mouth to face. Mouth to mouth contact. Mutual embracing occurs both statically and during locomotion. [Professor] Next please. [Man] Sonnets, "actualities" by ee cummings. "I like my body when it is with your body. "It is so quite new a thing." [Lee] Certain spontaneous outbursts of running. [Cathy] Running? Mm-hm, running and chasing. (Laughs) Chasing? Mm-hm, jumping. And dancing are commonly seen. Where are you going? (Cathy laughing) Oh! Oh! (Upbeat music) (Cathy shrieking) J'aii week long, we've been looking at horizons j' j'and it's hard on the brain j' j' sometimes I wonder is it the car or the highway j' j' that rolls through the rain j' j' this day has no number j' j' this day has no name j' j' but it's time for the weekend all the same j' j' why don't you put on your Saturday suit? J' j' let's fly away j' j' we could find ourselves a little cafe j' j' where the street people come to play j' j' and let the wine and the sunshine j' j' blow our minds away j' j' Saturday suit me fine today j' j' baby, won't you Saturday suit me fine today? J' j' darling, won't you Saturday suit me fine today? J' (sheep bleating) (Upbeat music) [Professor] Next please. This is from the Bible. The song of songs, which is Solomon. "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth, "for thy love is better than wine. "Because of the savior of thy good ointments, "thy name is as ointments poured forth." [Group] "Therefore do the virgins love thee." [Cathy] "A bundle of myrrh is my wealth, beloved unto me. "He shall lie all night betwixt my breast." Much of this pair formation phase may take place in public, but when it passes over to the precopulatory and copulatory phase, privacy is sought, and the subsequent patterns of behavior are performed in isolation from the other members of the species, as far as is possible. Right? Right. (Dreamlike music) [Coach] One, two, three. (Whistle blowing) Let's go, one, two, three, four (group applauding and cheering) J' you finger paint me j' j' I'll finger paint you j' j' remember children and j' j' the things they like to do j' j' and let your colors flow j' j' as they did long ago j' j' before forgetting how j' j' but you can finger paint me now j' j' is that the sound of the thunder in the eaves? J' j' finger paint me now j' j' is that the wind that's rising in the trees? J' j' love is the answer that j' j' we've always known j' j' why then do we let each other live and die alone? J' j' finger paint me now with your tiny hand j' J' you can touch me now j' j' I'm just a man j' (gentle music) You know, we could be arrested? We? It's your fantasy. Oh, right. Did you know monkeys and apes don't fall in love? I keep forgetting. A couple of groups come near it, but people are the only ones who really pair up. For long periods of time, I mean. People aren't a type of monkeys? They're primates. They're primates. True, have one and you've had them all. (Chuckling) A couple of facial expressions, a grunt and seven seconds later, it's over, and they're back to separate bananas. Well if you had to lie flat on your back on a branch, a quickie's about all you could handle. Wrong. She's on all fours. We're the only primates that mate face to face. Good idea for a song. J' the human race mates face to face j' (laughs) Idiot. You hate my music. I love it. (Choir singing in foreign language) Says here the female... Female monkey? Well, she (choir singing in foreign language) Uh-oh. (Choir singing in foreign language) What about the female monkey? Well, she doesn't seem to experience any kind of orgasm. Certainly nothing compared to you. Doesn't seem fair. What's worse, she only gets a little one week in four. One week in four? A little one week in four. And if she's pregnant or nursing, she just sits on it for the duration. It's not fair. The lower mammals don't do that well. Probably why they sleep all winter. (Laughing) (Choir singing in foreign language) The orgasm could work against the monkey's survival. She's only got a few days to get fertilized, and she better not spend any of that time being satisfied or she's cutting into her own mating time. [Arnie] Wilt thou have this woman to be thy lawfully wedded wife, to have and to hold, for better or worse, for richer or poorer, in sickness... But the male monkey gets his rocks off, right? [Arnie] As long as ye both shall live? Always. Not you, him. I do. Wilt thou have this man to be thy lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold... The male monkey's orgasm satisfies him and gives him time to regenerate more sperm. (Snoring) Hey. I'm regenerating. For as long as ye both shall live? Is your orgasm for regenerating too? Oh, I don't really think so, but in survival it has other advantages. For instance, it's quite wild, part of the old reward system, a little goodie for pairing off. But mostly, though, it helps assure fertilization. Do you understand? I do. Well, I don't. Simple gravity, twit. Look, the female monkey gets herself inseminated and then gets up and walks away on all fours, like nothing happened. Well that's fine, because on all fours the male sperm can stay put, but if your lovely bride here were to get up and head for the refrigerator like the female monkey, two legs and simple gravity lessen her chances of fertilization. So, you see, her orgasm keeps her heavenly horizontal for a safe period. (Choir singing in foreign language) You're sneaky. Us naked apes are the sexiest primates alive. And always ready. You mean it. Down. (Choir singing in foreign language) [Professor] Next please. "The merrie ballad of Nash, his dildo" by Thomas Nash. "He rubbed and pierced her ever to the bone, "digging as deep as he could dig for stones. "Now high, now low, now striking short and thick, "and diving deeper, pierced her to the quick. "His body presses against my breasts. My heart throbs." They're still turning each other on. What about me? Show me again. Mr. Rogers? Mr. Rogers? (Class laughing) It's your turn. Oh, sorry. I apologize for not having an example of erotic classic literature, but I would like to read something pertaining to attitudes. I mean, what is biologically natural as opposed to the culturally sinful, as you were saying earlier. "The vast bulk of copulation in our species "is obviously concerned not with producing offspring "but with cementing the pair bond "by providing mutual rewards for sexual partners. "The repeated attainment of sexual consummation "for a mated pair is clearly then not some kind "of sophisticated, decadent outgrowth "of modern civilization, but a deep-rooted, "biologically based and evolutionary sound "tendency of our species. "Any body relationship should be grist to our sexual mill "and as an inventive species, it should be natural "for us to experiment with any postures we like. "But the more the better, in fact, because this will "increase the complexity of the sexual act, "increase sexual novelty and prevent sexual boredom "between the members of a long-mated pair. "Any improvement in sexual rewards for the members "of a mated pair will obviously be important "in strengthening the pair bond." Desmond Morris, "the naked ape." (Class applauding) Uh, right. J' if the nightingales could sing like you j' j' they'd sing much sweeter than they do j' j' for your brought a new kind of love to me j' I like what you said about sex variations and pair bonding. Oh, thanks. But since we've bonded ourselves into overpopulation, isn't it time we got ourselves unstuck. J' you've brought a new kind of love to me j' how about a law that a person can only reproduce himself? You know, one for one. Of course, they'd have to enforce it. You mean with a fine? I mean with scissors. (Banging) J' you're a lady, and I am only a man j' j' I would work and slave the whole day through j' what the world needs now... J' so I could hurry home to you j' is a bucket of cold water. (Water splashing) J' because you've brought a new kind of love to me j' [loudspeaker] Overbreeding is biologically immoral. Stop overpopulation. [Crowd] Gay power, gay power, gay power. [Loudspeaker] Homosexuals are the last oppressed people. The planet is crowded. Come out. Overbreeding is biologically immoral. [Crowd] Gay power, gay power, gay power. [Loudspeaker] Overbreeding is biologically immoral. [Crowd] Gay power, gay power, gay power. [Loudspeaker] Homosexuals are the last oppressed people.

The lady said follow the yellow line. [Sandra] It's not moving. (Upbeat music) [Narrator] It took us millions of years to evolve into the sexual hunter, and then we think up civilization, and pow, in a few thousand years we become civilized. The point is, there was no time to make the adjustment.

Miss hemmings? (Typewriter clacking) (Cat caller whistling) (Phone ringing in distance) Oh. I'm cathleen, Cathy. Miss hemmings took a, or I think, left for who cares? Jellybeans. The bag broke. You're new. Yes, I was just assigned to you today. I decided to stop being a housewife. My husband's away, so I got out and joined the workforce. Uh, right. [Lee voiceover] You're a dirty old man. Yes, but I'm a healthy dirty old man. The whole world's geared to staring at each other's goodies. Voyeurism is a healthy, nonparticipating sex activity. The world should stare at the world. (Upbeat music) Did my wife call? Oh yes, she's meeting you downstairs. I'm sorry. That's all right. It's just that we're going to the country. It took us two million years to get out of the trees, and the rush hour could take another two million to get back in. (Upbeat ragtime music) J' specialize, organize j' night, Carl. J' when are we going to realize j' j' homo sapiens is facing his demise j' see you Monday, Stanley. J' how you gonna keep him up in the cities j' Ted, that's not your hat. J' stabilize j' good night, Bob. J' but don't forget how to j' you really blew their minds at that meeting today. J' improvise j' j' look what's happened to the eagle and whale j' j' what you gonna do when your systems fail? J' j' how will we synthesize a new atmosphere? J' j' how we will minimize the effects of fear? J' j' and can we justify what we're doing here? J' j' with the end so near j' j' tune in next week, tune in next week j' j'aii will be revealed j' j' oh analyze, theorize j' j' of all god's creatures we're certainly the wise guys j' j' and when we're all pressurized j' j'and when we're all moralized j' j' and when we're all sanitized j' j' we're still gorillas j' j' what you gonna do when you be arised? J' [Cathy] During the week, the naked ape rushes to cover the earth with steel and concrete, only to spend his weekend rushing to find what remains of nature. (Trumpet music) All right, ladies and gentlemen, let's follow the yellow line to the next exhibit. There, we will see displayed the result of man's greatest survival trick, his exploratory inventive urge. (Upbeat music) His highly developed mental and physical dexterity have enabled him to improve upon nature. (Upbeat music) The same hands that once grasped the branches of trees have since created the treasures of this earth. (Upbeat music) Our ancestral grunts and squeaks have become language and symbols to further aid our limited creative ability. [Class] A. (Upbeat music) J'ej' j'ij' j'oj' j'uj' j'a, e, I, oj' (screaming) Simpra. [Class] Simpra. Libra. [Class] Libra. (Operatic singing in foreign language) (Chalk squawking) J' ne-an-der-thal j' (Musical note) (Musical note) (Musical note) (Upbeat classical music) (Upbeat harpsichord music) (Classical cello music) (Piano music) We have even disciplined our bodies in the creative search for form and beauty. (Upbeat piano music) When the mind of man is at peace, he and his creations are truly the most exquisite on earth. (Gentle music) (Upbeat music) (Gentle music) (Upbeat music) It is one of the ironies of nature that the naked ape, while perfecting his greatest survival trick, his inventive exploratory urge, has managed to bring himself into conflict with an older, more primitive survival trick, his aggressive urge. All right, let's go. All right, let's move! Come on, move it out. Let's go. Come on, let's go here. Form a line right over there. Come on, hey, come on, move it out. [Cathy] His superior mentality has evolved a species defect, one that could cause him to exterminate himself by the end of the century. We animals fight amongst ourselves for one of two very good reasons, either to establish dominance in a class system. Get back in line! [Cathy] Or to establish territorial rights over a particular piece of ground. (Brakes squealing) You dirty son of a bitch! (Engine racing) Arnold dickerson! Here, I'm here. I'm here. You're late for the war. Don't worry, there'll be another one along any minute. All right now, follow the yellow line into the building, let's go. Move! (Marching drums) [Cathy] There is a rigidly established class system in most species of monkeys and apes. All right, hold it right here, stop. [Cathy] With the dominant male in charge of the group. Others range below him in varying degrees of subordination, and envy. So when the boss becomes too old to remain top ape, he is overthrown by a younger male, who then inherits the control, and envy, of the colony. Also, in most species of monkeys and apes, the responsibility of protecting the territory and the colony falls to the dominant male, who will lay his life on the line in order to protect his colony. The naked ape has reversed this procedure, it falling instead to the lesser males to defend not only the territory but the colony boss, who in return will spare no amount of technology in laying their lives on the line. (Inhaling) (Typewriter clacking) Make sure he's only got one hand on your shoulder at a time.

I believe in total appeasement. What would you do if a vicious enemy suddenly started coming at you, armed to the teeth and ready to kill you? Um. A vicious, uh, enemy. Armed to the teeth? (Mysterious music) Ready to kill me? (Mysterious music) Well, the first thing I'd do is throw down my weapon. Then, I'd show him my hands so that he could see that there wasn't anything in them. Then I would salute, so that he would see that my hands were flat out in the open and know that I wasn't making a fist. And if that didn't work, I'd take off my hat. Yeah, I'd definitely take off my hat and make myself very small. As small as I could get. See, I wouldn't wanna seem taller than he was. That's why I'd take off my hat. Hm, I'd lower my head. I'd lower my body. That'd be good and submissive. Yeah. Um, so is bowing. I think he'd understand a bow. Or maybe a curtsy. No, no, definitely a bow. (Groaning) King's x. [Arnie] That's it, I'd try some baby talk. That shows that I don't mean a wotta harm. (Groaning) Wot's of people talk baby talk. [Arnie] Perhaps if I offered him a chocolate bar. (Sword whooshing) And if he didn't like chocolate, I'd show him a few insecurity gestures to make him think him that I was totally incapable. (Mysterious music) Birds do things like that. Religion is very appeasing, if you know the right lousy religion. Oh, I think I would smile and laugh, and I think I would laugh a lot. I think I would laugh until I started to cry and fall down prostrate on the ground and grovel at his feet (sobs). Oh boy. Sounds sensible. A modicum of caution is required in every soldier. But, uh... In most disputes, the basic aggressive threat signals are strong enough to put a stop to the dispute without the contestants coming to blows. Then everybody uses appeasement signals. You have nothing to worry about. (Bugle playing "taps") But we're not using Spears anymore. Weapons have become highly impersonal. They're developed to be fired fantastic distances. How the hell's the enemy gonna see my appeasement signals? Look, it's a fair fight. You won't be able to see his either. (Atomic bomb exploding) How'd you make out? Forget it. What do I tell him? Tell him you like boys. I think I should tell you, I like boys. Then you'll probably like the army. (Upbeat music) (Sergeant whistling) (Upbeat music) [Cathy] In the ambrona valley of Spain, two excavations revealed a prehistoric fossil story about a band of homo erectus believed to have hunted here over 500,000 years ago. Most of the tools found in the valley were made of alien stone, which means that they were carried here in anticipation of the hunt. These early hunters had some understanding of place and season, and could visualize events in the future. They knew that the migratory grazing animals would be moving south through such natural funnels as the ambrona valley, migrating to the warmer lowlands, where they grazed for winter. (Upbeat music) (Elephant trumpeting) (Upbeat music) The basic patterns of behavior developed by us in these early days as hunting apes still shines through all our affairs today, no matter how lofty we make them appear.
