Damian. Hey, hey. Sweetie, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine, I'm fine. They're getting worse. It's fine, baby, it's just a nightmare, okay? It's not just a nightmare. You've been having these since you were a child. It's okay, all right? Go back to sleep. Come on. You should go back to sleep, it's okay. It's not okay, I can tell. - It is okay. - Something's different. It's all good, baby, promise. Okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yup, hoo! I'm up. I'm up. All right, tell me the address. I'll see ya there, okay? Sorry. You know you can't keep running away from this. I'm not running away, baby. I gotta go to work. Hey. Just don't forget Mom is coming over for dinner. Just don't be late. Okay? Promise. Just be careful. Always am. - Yeah. - Right. All right, everybody, give us the room. What do we got? A mess is what we got. Who called it in? Owner of the building. Said nobody's supposed to be in here. Anybody else? In an abandoned building in this neighborhood? You wish it was gonna be that easy. Derelicts, homeless, lotta lost stories in this neighborhood. Not the kind are gonna talk to cops. Looks like someone's looking for attention. Yeah. Nothin' but crazies out since Katrina. City's full of lunatics. New Orleans hasn't changed, buddy. You've just become old and bitter. Eh, can't argue with that. Wait. What is it? The Devil? Beltway Snipers did the same thing. Connection, copycat? Eh, not a copycat I don't think. Look at the incisions here, the way the body's laid out. Very intentional, specific. Even down to the signature. I forgot how it felt. So soft and beautiful. Just slowly decaying. Yes, slowly decaying. Something we have in common. It's been a long time, Ian. It took a long time. And why is that? I gave you a gift, a second chance. I feel like you might wanna appreciate my generosity. After last time I needed to make sure everything was perfect for your return. We kept the dimming box hidden well and it took me - a while... - Enough. Your loyalties aren't in question. The purpose for your loyalty sometimes makes me ponder. My purpose is that of the Circle of Night, to return you and your brothers to the Earth for the beginning of our new world. Ours? It's okay, child. I know you have your own agenda. As long as you don't forget your place, you will have everything you desire. I haven't been able to locate Moloch yet, but I'm getting close. I'll have it for you. You have my word. Very good. And the detective? In good time. He is an essential piece to the big picture. For now, continue to keep an eye on him. - But... - You question me? Patience, your time will come. That will be all. So soft and beautiful. Victim was DOA. Ligaments in the back of his ankles and elbows were severed. He was immobile for the assailant. Pieces of flesh were also missing. It looks like he was tortured for hours before he was actually murdered, but we're waitin' on forensics and pathology for time and actual cause of death. Oh, um, no witness. We got a partial fingerprint and a hair sample that we're sending up for DNA. No ID on the vic so we're just treatin' him as a John Doe right now. And the occult imagery? A whack job with a flair for the dramatics or an actual ritual killing? - Well... - It's actually too early to tell right now, sir. Anything else I should know about? No sir, not at this time. The department can only keep this under wraps for so long. You need to find this guy. We don't need mass hysteria over nothing. You remember back in '93 when we had those kids? Figure this out and put it to bed. Understood. That'll be all. Take this and get outta here. Hey, hey! What are you ladies up to? Hey! Oh, ya know, just nothin' but trouble. My future son-in-law. Future mother-in-law. How are you, son? - I'm doin' great. - Hey, babe. - How are you? - Good. Good, good. - Hi, baby. - Just goin' through more wedding stuff. How are ya? - I'm good, how are you? - Ooh, wait a minute. You look skinny. Oh. Has she been feeding you? It's time to eat. As much as she can. I've been a little busy at work. All right well, let's go fix that. All right. Get in the kitchen. Eh, you know the rule, no guns at the table. I better get washed up. - Sounds good. - I'll see ya in there - in a minute. - All right. Oh God. Oh gee whiz. I can't believe, it's just hard to believe that you used to babysit my little girl. Babysit? She wasn't a baby, okay? I was just makin' sure she didn't burn down the house. Oh, well that's actually a good thing that you did that. Man, I had such a crush on you. Well, you know things haven't changed very much. And after all these years you found each other again? I mean. Found each other? It's more like I had a stalker. Uh, I did not stalk you. - Unh-unh. - Okay, sorry. You just, ya know, consistently watched me from very close distance quite consistently. Well, that is my daughter, my Abi. She goes after what she wants and she gets it. Mm-hm. And ya know if I remember correctly, you did not seem to put up much of a fight. Well, you did turn out to be quite the beautiful woman. - Mm. - Well that's because she takes after her mother. Yes, she does. Mm, you know what? I wanna say something. I think it's time that we actually celebrate. I mean it has been a long time coming. Mom. Yeah, it was a long time ago. I know, I just wish your mom and dad were here. And I'm glad that I officially get to call you son. Okay. As nice as that is, it's a little sappy for me. So why don't you guys tell me what you came up with for the wedding. Go ahead. Okay, okay, so. I gotta tell you, we just ordered the cake today. You may reveal yourself to me. Elric is concerned about the plan. Ancient perspectives with no foresight has always been the way of the Circle of Nine. But shouldn't we? The last time you were here you were captured by our enemies, then Abaddon, Leviathan, and of course Moloch. Should we not be cautious? You question me. No. Mr. Parrish is taking care of any problems that may get in the way. What should I tell Elric and the elders? You tell them that my children are coming. Darkness will fall on light, and as I complete the rites of the Seven Seals of Solomon, my brothers will come forth and will create a world of pain and suffering. That is what you should tell Elric and the elders. I shall relay your message. And Magus, prepare the lair for my children. Of course. Continue with the your task at hand. Some day this will be your responsibility. I cast you back into your prison! Do what needs to be done! I love you, son. You know we really need to stop meeting like this. It is over, Seryph. Before you die you will watch me murder the entire world and everyone you love! What is happening to me? Who is this guy? Who is this guy? Nobody. Nothing, normal guy, normal job. I made some calls. I mean this guy is completely fucking uninteresting. Kept to himself. His coworkers said he is a really nice guy. Yeah, nice guy with a missing liver. Yeah, that could be voodoo, cannibalism. Did you get anything from the lab? Well that got nothin'. Fingerprints, DNA came up empty. It's like this guy was never even born. How is that even possible? All right, no problem. So what you're sayin' is we got nothin'. We got nothin'. Got nothin'. Welp, keep at it. Cap called me again. He's got a bug up his ass. Gimme the file. I'm gonna hit the streets. It's too damn hot in here. All right, thanks. We gettin' a drink later? Oh, sorry buddy, I can't. I got a hot date with a bartender named Abigail. Thomas Mallen. Took me a while to find you. What do you want? Well come on, Tom. You know what I want. You were there that night. You know. Really? That's what this is about? You think torturing me gon' get me to tell you? Mr. Parrish, I don't know where it is. That's how it works. None of us know everything. Well, you know who I am. You know what I'm capable of. You don't scare me. And neither does that master of yours. He is not my master! Sure. You know, there are moments like these that we can't ever get away from. Moments that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that we're all alone. And you will die alone, but you'll serve a greater purpose than the order could've ever given you. It's gonna be a long afternoon, Mr. Mallen. Yes. Ah, see? That's how it's done, son, right there. Don't try and get one over on me. I been playin' this game longer than you've had pubic hairs. Eh, it's not the '70s anymore, Frank. There's somethin' called grooming. Seriously? You gonna throw that metrosexual shit at me again? You should try it, Frank. Women do appreciate a well-groomed man. Well I'm quite happy with my forest, thank you very much, young lady. Another round? What time is it? Uh, it's almost 11. No, I should get my tired old bones home. Yeah, wouldn't mind gettin' an early start either. Hey, um, the word out on the street, I talked to some of my peeps. - Your peeps? - My peeps. You said peeps. I said peeps, I'm still cool. And my peeps didn't have anything. I mean seriously, there's nothin' out there. There's no word at all. This guy's a ghost. Looks like we're back to square one. Yeah, this is Garrison. He's right here with me. Sure, on our way. What's up? Looks like we got another one. Hey babe, looks like we're not headin' home. Everything okay? Yeah. Love ya, sweetheart. Back at ya, Frank. We might be late. Oh, it's fine. I gotta close anyway. Well, be careful. Love you. Love you, too. I hate to say, I told you so. Anybody see anything? No, same as last one. No witnesses. Nobody saw anything. We were able to lift fingerprints this time. Definitely got DNA, but if this guy is not in the system, I don't see how it helps us. Cut out his heart. We're not gonna be able to keep this quiet much longer. Do not be afraid, my child. Your blood will cleanse my body and your name will forever be etched in the Book of Darkness. We all have our purpose, and yours is to serve as a means to sustain this body. Seriously, you stayed here all night again? Yes I did because we got something, okay? I checked with CID to see if they had anything that resembled what we got goin' on here. Okay, same M.O., two different parishes in the last six months. Same deal. No DNA, partial prints, no matches. - Vics? - Vics. Mr. Christopher Hyde, okay, age 52. He went missing for a couple of days then he shows up in Lafayette lookin' like this. This card right here, it's known as The Emperor. Okay, let's fast forward two months. Miss Connie Hyde. Okay, mother of two, 53 years old. She goes missing, she's found about 30 miles from her house in Iberville. Tongue cut out, heart cut out, left in a counterweight on the scene, okay. This card right here? It's known as the Ten of Swords. So our guy's got a thing. He's got a thing. Did you talk to Garceau over at CID with this? How did nobody put this together? You know bureaucratic bullshit outweighs police work - all the time. - It's time to bypass the bureaucratic bullshit and go see my friend Victor. - The priest? - Yeah. The priest. Great, we're gonna go see a priest. Damian. So good to see you. You, too. Very happy you called. I've known Damian since he was in diapers. Isn't that right, Damian. Come in, come on. Pardon the mess. Just got back. Where from? The Vatican. Went to the Curio. I thought you retired. God's work is never done. What can I help you and Mister... Garrison. Garrison. We're workin' a case right now and we came across some occult imagery, like ritual killing stuff, and I wanted to show you some images. Maybe you can help us out. Sure, sure. This is all highly confidential. Of course. My God. Who would do such a thing? Do you recognize... This is the Star of Solomon, sometimes referred to as the Star of Babel, but only when it's inverted like it is in these photos. I have something that may help. Solomon believed, believed that he could close the gates of Heaven and Hell and rule Earth himself without interference from their ruler Lucifer. And does any of this have anything to do with anything? Maybe very little, maybe quite a lot. You'll find reference in there to a man named Terric. He believed he could do the same thing by releasing the Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. Huh. Whomever is doing that believes the same. We also had these Tarot cards. Think of that? Not my area of expertise, but I do know someone who may help. Why don't you pay her a visit. Great, I'll do that. Thank you, Victor. Of course. Listen, if you think of anything else, give us a call. One more thing. Take a look at that. Great. Thank you, take care. Yes, thank you, Padre. Happy hunting, Mr. Garrison. Look out for my boy. It was a pleasure. Pathology report. Fingerprints, DNA matches. It's definitely our guy. But even the FBI and Homeland Security can't find anything on him. He's good. You come up with anything? No, I got nothin'. Nothin' connects these two. I mean, it just seems so random. How about your priest friend? Well, I mean it's obvious he believes in what he's doing, but ya know, I don't believe anything I can't see or I can't prove, so. Well now there might be somethin' to understanding what he believes. Yeah, well we just need to stick to the facts and the evidence. Well I am. Just thought maybe if I could get inside his head I might understand what he's thinking, what he's feeling. Stay out of his head. Stick to the facts of the evidence. And go home and get some rest. The infernal realm created by Lucifer was divided amongst his generals and his kings. Abatu, Moloch, Abaddon, and Leviathan betrayed Lucifer and become known as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Lucifer came to Earth to start his own bloodline. The three king demons, Aamon, Belial, and Paimon, were assigned to protect their earthly brothers and supply them with both the knowledge and training in the ways of exorcism and protection. Terric and his brother Parcival were born of the Lucifer bloodline. Their bloodline split after Terric ignored the words and teachings of Paimon and began listening to the whispers of Abatu. Terric would raise Abatu from Hell and drink from his blood and grant him eternal life, but his flesh would slowly decay over time. The tale of Solomon goes back to the time of Babel. The tower which stood to the clouds was built by the Sumerian slaves captured, taken by the ruler, during the time of Mesopotamia. The tower became a beacon of worship. The language of Enochian was passed on to Solomon. Solomon would use the language to create a poem. At the sacrifice of seven the seals will allow for the closure of Heaven and Hell. Those rituals would become a reflection of both an arrangement of body and ritual of passage. The Seven Seals of Solomon. Hm. Yeah. Okay. Yeah, I'll be right there. No one. Hey. Go, go. - What's up? - Damian. I'm sorry, but I don't want you in on this. What are you talkin' about? I don't want you in on this. I don't know how to... Okay, this is a little strange, all right. Hey Damian. - What is it? - I don't know how to tell you this. It's, it's, it's Joan. It's our guy. It's the same M.O. - What? - Damian. - No. - Damian. Damian! No. No. I don't know how she's mixed up in it. But I'm gonna take care of this 'cause you need to go home. Abi needs to hear this from you. She needs to hear it from you. I got this. Go home. Come on. Let's go. Home. But I, I want to... Be with Abi. I got this. Sorry. Abigail. She would say, "Abi, "death is nothing but a ripple "in the life lived in the waste of time." You already know. I'm her daughter. When you're close to someone you're truly connected, you feel when that connection is broken and I felt it. What's that? She gave it to me. A present to protect us. Ironic. Whatever you need, Abigail, okay? You know she really loved you. I know. Mr. Parrish. Where is my father? Your father is resting. Don't lie to me. What's the matter, Mr. Parrish? Don't you have something that you need to be doing? Oh, I can handle my shit but what about you? You really think he can control the dog when he's off his leash. Abatu can be controlled. That's not your problem. What it the Seryph realizes who he is? Is that not my problem either? He'll be dead long before that can happen. Ya know that's what I admire about you the most, your arrogance. You elders and your rules. You know how many of you I've seen come and go? Be careful, Mr. Parrish. Know your place. Oh, I know my place. I'm Ian Parrish, son of Terric Parrish, and the direct descendant of Lucifer himself. My loyalty is with the order and my father, not you. Why do you disgrace us and everything your father has built? We have remained inconspicuous for centuries and now you, flaunting your narcissism, craving that your name be marked in history for your depraved perversions. In exchange for what? Vainglorious reputation? And in process you bring unwanted attention to us. You are laughable, Ian. You're not a god, you're an aberration. There's gonna be a time when your father can't even save you. It'd be wise not to test me. That's enough! My own flesh and blood. You stench marked with joy! Pettiness grows tiresome. For 800 years I've dedicated myself to our cause. And now we are so close to seeing it through. You must trust in me and the order. Abatu is our master, but in time he will be our slave. We are the key to his obedience. I will not have us divided. Forgive me my insolence. Continue your mission and our bidding. Yes, Father. Hi, you must be Victor's friend, Damian. Yeah. My mom made me aware. Please come in. - Thanks. - Yeah. Thank you. I'll go get my mother for you. Thank you. May I help you? I'm sorry. What do you have to be sorry about? I'm the one that's blind. Um, well my friend Victor sent me. I'm Detective Damian Seryph. I'm workin' this case and... I know who you are. Come, child. Sit, Detective Seryph. I wasn't looking for a reading. I know what you're looking for, Mr. Seryph. Sit. I appreciate your time. Your mind's eye contains the information you need. I will be a medium to what needs to be seen. How do you know... Silence. I see the terror of many. These cards do not represent you but an old poem. The Devil. Forces once thought tamed. Judgment. Came the rising of the dark souls. The Emperor and the master of pestilence. The Ten of Swords. The end is coming. The Tower. With disaster, demons, and despair. The Lovers create juxtaposition for a choice between love and abandonment. Death with a harsh death for all who had been protected. Babylon. Seven Seals of Solomon. House of Babel. House of Babel. No. Miss, um. No. Okay, I'll get... Damian. Damian. Abi, Abi. - I gotta go. - Mom. That's enough. I didn't do it. Mom, are you all right? I'm fine. Young man, you need to look inside to find all that's holdin' ya back. Your destiny is only possible with your sight. Wait, I, I... Is she okay? She's fine, she just needs to lie down for awhile. Things can get really intense for her, but I've never seen her like that. She kept repeating House of Babel. You have any idea what that means? No, not really. Wait. She used to do readings for this guy named Jack. He stayed in a place called House of Babel. She stopped going, but actually she never said why. I just figured she must've dug up some really dark stuff and she didn't wanna revisit it. You know where that's at? Spring Road, the old rundown house. But it'll probably be a waste of your time. Why is that? It's been abandoned for years. Thank you, Annelise. Hey! You've reached the voicemail of Frank Garrison. You've reached the voicemail of Frank Garrison. Jesus. Jack the Ripper. Damian Seryph. Don't worry, I'm not gonna kill you. I will kill you. You know, your great-grandfather said the same thing to me. But here I am. Oh, I'm very sweet, coz, and I'm gonna enjoy takin' away everything you love and cherish most, especially your sweet Abigail. If you touch her, I swear I'll... Shit. God. Gah! - Hello? - Frank. What is it, Damian? Listen, I found him. I'm in his place right now. Is he there? No, he's not here. I'll explain when ya get here. Just, uh, Damian. bring everybody. - Damian. - I'll explain when ya get here, okay. Damian, wait. Where is everybody? What's the problem. Come on, let's go inside. I'll show you where he was at. Damian. The fuck are you doing here? Well, I found the guy. Our killer has been inside... What the fuck are you doing here? I followed a lead. - A lead? - Could be inside. A lead? Put it in a file. No warrant. - Come on, Frank. - No warrant, no crime scene, Damian. You know that. What... Damian, I didn't come over here 'cause I was your friend. I didn't come over here because I was your partner. I came over here 'cause the chief had me in his office to tell me he wants you off this case. No. Too close. You gonna pull me off this fuckin' case? I'm not doin' shit. - Fuckin' found the guy. - Damian. He's fuckin' in there. He had a fuckin' knife to my fuckin' throat! And now you're gonna pull me off? Do not treat me like a fucking rookie, Frank. - Okay. - Okay? What I've seen, what I've done, I know what's inside there. This should be crawling with CSI right now. You're right. Don't gimme that fuckin' look either. No warrant. No crime scene. I don't fuckin' need to hear that again. So what do you wanna do here, huh? I want you to go home. - I want you to be with Abi. - You want me to just walk away from this? I want you to be with the woman you love who is going through a really rough time now. I don't know if ya noticed, but her mother died. I want ya to clean yourself up. I want ya to get some rest. Ya look like ya haven't slept in over a week and everybody is noticing. I can't do this. Did you sleep this week? When's the last time you slept, tell me. Last night? Night before last? You got a good eight hours sleep. Night before that? Come on, it's fuckin' bullshit. What do you wanna do? We just walk away from this? We got a mountain of evidence sittin' inside there and you know it. And we just walk away? We just walk away, pretend none of this ever happened, not one bit of it. We have door between this mountain of evidence and us, and we got a chief of police who says you're no longer allowed near any of that evidence because you're not on the case anymore. That's what we got. You know what else you got? Ya got a woman ya love at home alone. Ya got a partner who's worried that you are losing your mind. Frank, I'm not losing - my mind. - Look me in the eye - I'm not losing my mind. - and tell me that you - Don't gimme that, gimme that - are acting normal. gimme that act! Are you actin' normal? Are ya, Damian? Look at me. Look at me and tell me this is all normal daily behavior! Come on. Go home. If it's there now, it'll be there after we get a warrant. Rest, clean yourself up, be with Abi. Okay. All right. Damian. Just go home. Hey, this is Abi. Hey, this is... Hey, this is Abi, leave a message. Abi, it's me. Could ya please call me back? I'm gettin' a little worried. Thank you. What the fu-? You need to start tellin' me what the hell is goin' on. Damian. Geez. I deserve the truth, Victor! Yes, you do. You deserve the truth. I trust you looked at those books I gave you. Yes. Those stories are real, Damian. They're not fantasies or fictions or myths. Lucifer came to Earth to start his bloodline to protect all of us. Okay, no offense, Victor, but that is insane. Centuries, Damian, centuries. Get your mind around that. Centuries ago his bloodline, your bloodline split between the Parrishes and the Seryphs. The Parrishes continued to serve the Four Horsemen, their exiled kings, whereas the Seryphs... Enough of this! No, Damian, you need to listen! You are the direct descendant of Lucifer. The Golden Dawn, Abi's mom, your father, all the others were demonologists protecting all of us from horrors too unspeakable to imagine much less understand. My duties take me outside the boundaries of my diocese. I was charged with assisting the Golden Dawn and matters, let's just say the church would rather not get their hands dirty with. Magic, exorcisms, hermetic rites and practices. This has been going on for centuries, Damian. This is bigger than the church. Let's just say we figured out that if we didn't all work together, well, we'd sure as hell fail as one. The crest of the Seryph. The helm of Lucifer. Familiar? Your father was special because of the gifts he was born with. You were born with those same gifts. Been seeing things lately, Damian. Yeah, I should think ya have. Your time has come, it's arrived. Time for you to replace your father and accept your inheritance. I tried, I tried to watch out over you and protect you like I promised your mother I would. - My mother? - Yes, your mother. She understood her responsibilities and accepted the risk. As does the one who is chosen to watch out over you and protect you and be the vessel for your bloodline. Abi. Abigail. Abigail was chosen for you when she was still a child. You're tellin' me my whole life has been a lie? Please, Damian. Oh, we don't have time for this. Don't have time for this? Don't ya think this is something you shoulda told me, I don't know, maybe 20 years ago? Damian, please. No Damian me! So I met the man that's killing off your Golden Dawn. I imagine you know who that is, right? His name is Ian Parrish. His father is Terric. They belong to the Circle of Nine. They are very dangerous. Is there anything else you want to tell me? How 'bout where's Abi? Abigail? When was the last time you talked to her? When I left last night she was sleeping. Perhaps you know where she's at. Abi and Joan brought me this two days ago. She thought maybe this place was somehow connected to the Hellfire Club. Maybe she went there to check it out. We're done here. Don't, Damian. You're not ready for this, not this. Good luck. Abigail? Abigail! What are you doing? Damian. - You can't be here. - Behind you! It's not safe. You need to go. Abigail! Damian, Damian. Damian, we gotta go. We need to go, come on. Come on, get up. What just happened? Let's go. Sit down. Damian. Sit down. Sit down! Damian. He's created a legion. What the hell is a legion? I know it's a lot to fathom, but there are worlds beyond ours, worlds of angels. And demons. No, no! This doesn't make any sense. Damian, did what you see back there seem like make believe? You're just starting to tap into your gifts. Did you ever even love me? I loved you ever since I was a little girl, Damian. This wasn't a job I was given, but a gift. I love you more than anything in this world. You lied to me. You both did! How am I supposed to trust you again? - Damian. - No, you are staying here with Victor. You can't go out there alone. It's too dangerous. You need me. I need a drink. Damian. Don't stop me. Love's tricky. Just needs some time. He'll be okay. He's starting to believe. Hey. Meet me at The Brickyard? I don't need a partner, I need a friend. And a drink. That's quite a fuckin' story, pal. I know. I know. But it's real. As real as you sittin' in front of me. I don't even know what to say to you. Say that you fuckin' believe me. We've been partners, we've been friends for a very long time, haven't we? You're my family. That means I believe in you. Even if I don't believe everything you're sayin' right now. So why don't we make a deal. I'm gonna check out all this lair shit. - Thank you. - Yeah. But while I'm diggin', you're gonna promise me that you're gonna go home and you're gonna get some rest because ya look like shit. Okay. What? Okay. Okay. Promise me you'll call me if you find anything. I will call you, sweetheart, as soon as I find somethin'. Go, go. Ya need sleep. - Thank you. - Yeah. We're family, Damian. Hey. It's me, Garrison. All right, keep it together. What the hell? Hello? Hello? What? Damian. Who's there? Where am I? Damian. Stay where ya are. I said don't come any closer! Damian, you are in a safe place. My name is Paimon, king demon and servant of our father, Lucifer. I have been tasked as the protector of the Seryph bloodline. Damian, I must show you the truth, the truth about your past that may gravely affect your future. The truth is in your mind's eye. Your bloodline was created by our great father to protect the Earth from the 14 demons that were exiled for their betrayal. This was the last time the Hellfire Club attempted their plan. Had Abatu shed his skin, he and his legion would've been unstoppable. And they were very close to succeeding had it not been for the Seryph bloodline. That's him. Yes, Ian Parrrish. He once was a pupil of your great-grandfather's. This was Ian' first attempt in completing the ritual of the Seven Seals of Solomon. Joseph thought he had slain his cousin, the one who had betrayed him, but what he did not know was that Abatu had given Ian the gift of immortality. My nightmare. It is time you remember. Pay attention, son. Some day this will be your responsibility. In the name of the infernal sky, Hell in its dominion casts you back into your prison. By Cain, Moloch. Damian! Do what needs to be done! I killed my father. You had no choice. Infernal lord, protect us. Infernal lord, protect us. Son, you must be strong. You did the right thing. It's not your fault. I will always be with you. When it is time, you will need to take my place. You'll be watched over on Earth and from beyond. Remember who you are. Never forget how much I love you, son. No. Why don't I remember this? Because you weren't ready and until you were I did not allow it. You are Damian Seryph, son of William, son of Michael, son of Joseph, the earthly son of Lucifer himself. You are the last protector of this world. A new battle has emerged. And now they have the dimming box containing Moloch, the one your father gave his life for. The veil of death is about to be unleashed on the Earth and you're the only one who can stop them. You must send Abatu back to Hell so he can be judged. It's time for you to be what this world was waiting for you to be, what your father was and his father before him. Now wake up. I'm so sorry. Yeah. I found him. You were so right. I'm sorry I doubted you. Is Abigail there? Yeah, I'm texting you. Meet me out back. Damian, let's keep this between us for now. You've reached the voicemail of Frank Garrison. Oh Frank, pick up. You've reached the voicemail... Abi. Damian. We need to get outta here now. We gotta go. I'm gettin' it. I got it. Welcome Damian. Take him. I'm not afraid of you. You should be. Prepare him. I will send you back to Hell. Frank? Just wouldn't let it go, would ya, Damian? And I worked so hard to get you to drop it. Just too stubborn, ya know. This'll be over soon. Innocent people are dead 'cause of you. Not innocent people, Damian. Ignorant people. People that get in the way of destiny, like you. We were family, Frank. You disgust me. We gather tonight to usher in a new age with our dark god, our king, our infernal master. We gather tonight to offer sacrifice for the Sixth Seal of Solomon. Hail! Receive our master's blessing and feel his blood coursing through your veins. And with the sacrifice of the last remaining Seryph, the Seven Seals of Solomon shall be complete. Hail! The gates of Heaven and Earth shall be closed forever and we shall rejoice at the end of the war and the dawn of a new age. Our master shall shed his earthly flesh and lead us into glory! Hail! Commence. It is over, Seryph. Know that you will help give birth to a new world. You see? You are the key, the key to all of this, always have been. With your blood you're the last piece to completing the ritual and setting me free. It's not over yet. Children, rise. Bring in the sixth sacrifice. Abigail. Let her go! Let her... You weak piece of shit. You belong in Hell, Frank. Shut up, idiot. You can't stop this. Ya never could. This is fate, fate that is finally upon us. You are here just to bear witness to the rise of Abatu. I deny you. I deny your powers. You're not to be a vessel. Go to him, child. I'm so sorry. I love you. Behold the end of the Golden Dawn. Hail! Hail. Hail. Hail. Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! Hail! - I am - Hail! Damian Seryph, son of William, son of Joseph, son of Michael, and son of Lucifer. Abatu! Damian. Damian. Damian. You killed everything I ever loved. Seryph. You found your power, but I've had mine since the beginning of time. Your war is lost and you shall give me vindication as the true god of Earth. Damian, Damian. you're going to die. This is my kingdom. Hell and a place where you have no power. Did you actually think you could defeat me, Damian? Hell lives within you, Damian. And I rest. Enough games, Abatu. You think this is a game? Oh. You cower at the power of the infernal world, the power that gave you life. You are a child, weak, afraid. You failed everyone that's ever loved you. Enough! Damian, look at yourself. Broken, pathetic. Victor, Joan, Abigail, all those that protected you and died for you, you have failed them. Enough! Damian. Help me. Damian the Seryph. Back when I was young and in my prime I was the shadow of fear amongst these streets. Were ya now? Yes, cousin, I was. You see, I know who I am and what I am, and I embrace it, but you, you you deny it. You're weak, pathetic, just bring shame on your bloodline. How did you veer so far off the path of what you were put here to do? History has perverted me, Damian, but it also gave me a purpose. I as my father's son traveled the world in search of the Book of Eternal Darkness. Abatu gave me back my life, my immortality. His blood runs through my veins. I know who I am and what I am. I am darkness. I am death. And through me all that you love will be destroyed. You are finished. Your eternal cage shall be that of your failures, misery, and loneliness. No. I banish you from this world and send you back to Hell. Oh, Abi. I'm so sorry. Was the ritual successful? It was not. - Garrison? - Dead. - The Magus? - Dead, along with the rest of Hellfire. And Abatu? Sent back to Hell. Now I warned you of the cost. If you all would've listened instead of letting your ego and arrogance rule you none of this would've ever happened. Now I told you to let me kill the Seryph when I had the chance and now... Silence! Your grave disrespect will not be tolerated. Mind your tongue, elder. Speak, son. Damian Seryph has become, I present to you our lord Moloch for the Circle of Nine and for you, Father. Abatu has played his part. The legions still walk amongst the living. And they will feast upon this world bringing chaos and death. Seryph has removed those too weak to fulfill their duties, but there are more. Many more. And Moloch will be free again. I'll be right there. I have come to accept my destiny and my birthright. I shall protect this world from all that may endanger it, seeking to bring darkness to the light. I am no longer a detective for the living but a seeker of justice for those that threaten the balance. I am the devil of devils. Whispers amongst the darkness have given me a name, one that all those who oppose me will come to fear. I am the Demonologist.
