You should thank God you have a job. Not everyone can work by day. The night shift has to be covered. But I want to see my wife and daughter. That's your problem. You have a bad record. You've been to prison. How can I give you the day shift? What do you expect from me? What would happen if I work days? If they are extending an iron hand concealed in a velvet glove... Then it has no positive meaning. The change you are talking about is something you yourself need. You have no choice. You need to change. If you don't change... - Be a good girl. - Okay. Don't be naughty. Phone in to give us your views on the elections. Tell us if you plan on voting or not. Why will you vote in this election? - Or why won't you? - You really want to know? Will you take me hunting? No. - Hunting? - Yes. - You? - So what? - Sure! - Well, why not? Hunt what? Do you know how? - I can go. - Hunting? I never have, but I can learn. - You can learn? - You can guard? Least he does something. Not like you! Look how fat he is! Just eats and talks! Think before you speak! He sleeps by day. Here he eats forfree then falls asleep! - You talk too much. - Admit that you want to sleep! - Get out! - Go away! And they call you security guards? Why are you here? - Need anything? - No. Good bye. Good luck! - It's yourfault. - He should be fired! He's cheeky. - You want some tea? - No, thanks. This road will lead to our downfall. Going back is failure. Between downfall and failure... Down with the dictator... Down with the dictator... - Hello. - Hello. Sorry to botheryou. Have you seen Sara and Saba today? No, we were supposed to go to the park. I thought they had other priorities. - Is anything wrong? - No. I thought they might be here. Thanks. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Yes? You work nights? Yes. - Your wife works days? - Yes. What is your relationship like? Good. How good? - You don't see each other. - That is none of your business. If you know anything, tell me. I've been here for a while. It might be none of our business, but we're obliged to ask. I've been here forthree hours. An hour in the corridor. An hour in some room. Now here. If you know anything, tell me. If not, I should go. Maybe they're back. Why the questions? Do you know where they are or not? Can't be difficult to answer. If you have no news, say so. Don't ask personal questions. There was a shoot-out between insurgents and police. Your wife was killed. It was an accident. We can't determine who shot her. She died in the crossfire. What shoot-out? What do you mean? An exchange of fire. What does my wife have to do with it? There's a photograph in her handbag, your address is on it. A photograph of you together with your wife. Where's my child? My daughter? There's no mention of a child in our report. There must be a mistake. The address is yours, the photograph is of you. What time did it happen? Between 12:00 and 12:30 pm. Then they were together. My wife always picks up my daughter before going home. She was alone according to our report. Your report is not correct. No, I'm sure it was her. No, my wife and daughter stay together. They don't separate. My wife always picks up my daughterfrom school. Impossible. They're always together. Maybe she left her somewhere... At a neighbour's... - No, they're always together. - Our report states that she was alone. Who killed her? We can't really tell without an autopsy. We must examine the bullet to see whether it was police or insurgents. We want you to come to the morgue with us to identify the body. Look for my daughterfirst. They are never apart. It's late. She's only seven. You can't... I understand. We'll do everything we can to find her. Don't worry. I'm not asking for much. Just find her. Of course. Please wait here. Recognise her? Yes? My daughter is missing. - How old is she? - Six, nearly seven. Where did you lose her? In an accident. She hasn't come home. What can we do? Just check if she's in one of your wards. Please take a seat and wait while we look for her. What happened to our nephew? I've already told you to wait until the doctor arrives. I've been here for an hour! We are very busy. You must wait yourturn. Take a seat. You can't sleep here. - I'm looking for my daughter. - At this hour! No girls here. Move it! Sara Partovi Alavi is his wife's name. His daughter's name is Saba Alavi. Thank you. My husband is in prison. When he was arrested I didn't think I'd see him alive again. I told him I'm pregnant. I lied... Because I love him. Only criminals are in prison! Does he deserve a child? Even if he made a mistake, why shouldn't he have a child? He changed once he thought I was pregnant. I'd rather die than for him to know I lied. On each visit I gave him hope. Please help me. I must have a child. Yes? Hello. She may be your daughter. Recognise her? It's her birthday. You should've brought her. Sara too. We could've been together. You came all this way. Saba had school today... They had other plans later. I think this evening Saba is going... to a friend's home. They have the same birthday. So Sara told you not to bring her. No, she's not to blame. Not to blame. Why did you bring the cat? Saba wanted you, Grandma, to look after it. Can she read and write? Yes, she's good... At least for a six-year-old. Seven years old today. I wish she were here. I have a gift for her. Want to see it? Yes, sure. ...I thank you, God. I praise you for giving me ears so that I may hear sweet melody. I praise you for giving me legs so that I may go wherever I... Who is the one that praises you in hell, my Lord? Who is the one? Isn't it pretty? Is it the right size? Yes it is. Otherwise, she'll grow into it. I'll gift-wrap it later. Is anything wrong? Get moving. Get moving. Cop-killer! Think our country has no law and order? Why leave your rifle in the car? Why don't you answer? - What can he say? - What should he say? How far are we? Half way. We have to go this way. Are we making our own trail? You've got a watch but no time! Where would you be without a uniform? We've already passed here twice. What the hell are you doing? What can I do? Trees all look the same. If west is that way... the car is that way. What can I say? You forgot the walkie-talkies! You're all talk, cheeky bastard. Good-for-nothing! - What are you staring at? - You should have stayed in the car. - Think you could catch him alone? - Lead the way, if you're so clever. Always backtalk from him! Well, we're lost! And he just stares at the ground. Look at him... He makes me sick! What are you doing? Mind your business. I want to get backup! Walk faster! Just look at him... - What's wrong? - He's going to hell! - What? - Out of my way! He must die! Why? It's not up to us! He gets the death penalty! We can't decide that! - We can! - No. - I give the orders here! - He has to be tried. - He'll be executed anyway. - Our duty is to take him in. That's a waste of time! - Ajudge decides his guilt! - Look at his fucking face! - What for? - Look at him! Let's send him to hell. Why drag him around? We can't do that! We have to turn him in. - He killed cops like us! - I won't let you. Out of my way! A cop-killer, idiot! It's not up to you! Ajudge decides. I won't let you. I've trained many soldiers like you. You think you're clever! I won't let you! Ajudge decides. Maybe they'll set him free! You idiot, we're the prisoners! He slows us down! We have to turn him in... - Don't you get it? - It's you who doesn't get it! You don't get it! He makes me fucking sick! - I'll work something out. - Where are you going? You'll lose us! Shut up and stay here! I'll see to you later! Who doesn't have a problem with the police? My colleague is corrupt. Takes bribes... Kills people he doesn't like. You'd be dead if I weren't here. Forget my uniform. I'm human, just like you. What happened to you could happen to me. I'm in this uniform for my military service. I have to be in uniform. I have no choice. Unlike him. He chose to be a policeman, I didn't. When we get back, God knows what he'll do. Who knows what he plans for me? He killed someone. He wants to blame me! Let's get going. There's a path by the river. Move it! Let's go. Get the hell inside. You, fetch some wood! Faster! Quickly! Sit overthere. Son-of-a-bitch! Inside the fucking shed! Come this way. Look at the lazy bastard. Faster! Move it! What's wrong? Where you going? Let go, I need to warm up. - What? - Get going! Pushing me around all day! Go to hell! Watch it! I'll fuck you up. - I never even complain! - Who do you serve? - Not you! - Why are you here? - Not foryou. - If you're insubordinate... Go find the way back. Bring help! - Get going! - Let go! If I go, it's not foryour sake. - You're in big trouble. - You can't do anything. - You'll see. - Get going. Move it! Fuck off or I'll finish you off! - Big talker! - Go! Run! Don't waste time. Son-of-a-bitch. Run! Go ahead, keep staring! Get moving and bring help! Get lost! Go inside. Get up! Overthere. On your knees. On your knees. On your knees. Cuff your hands to that. Cuff your hands to that. Overthere. Turn around. Listen. You've killed two already... Killing a third cop won't make any difference. Help me. Where are you going? What a fucking loser! Put it down. Put it down. Move it. On the ground. The belt, the belt. Faster. Get on with it. - Okay, here. - Faster... Go overthere. This is what you get from fucking traitors. Don't shoot. Take off your uniform. Why the uniform? - Take off your uniform. - No, I won't. - Hurry! - What for? Don't shoot for God's sake! Hurry! Don't shoot. I'll do it. Don't shoot. What the... Don't point it at me, I'm doing it! I'm done for! Don't do it. I have a kid. Don't shoot for God's sake. Satisfied? It's off! God help me. Stuck here. Does this mean I won't get that bastard? Son-of-a-bitch. Throw me the keys. The keys! Here! Think my uniform is enough to escape? In memory of BOZORG ALAVI
