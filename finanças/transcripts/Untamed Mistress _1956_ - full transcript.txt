(Exotic Music) (Music Fades) (Sounds of the Jungle) i'm sorry i was late. how's he doing? bad doc, bad. the boys had a tough go but i never will understand these natives. if he'd only gone to the hospital you could be using a respirator on him now how long has he been this way about a month he should have been on a dispensary three years ago when he first had his accident. you mean the gorilla attack? uh-huh he was pretty badly mauled his chest was crushed. that's before i was transferred out here from the states i didn't hear all the details on it hand me the ammo nitrate out of the kit i didn't hear all the details myself and people around these parts don't talk very much especially pasta he's a noble character and proud his gun bearers have been with him for years they tell me he used to be a maharaja in india him a maharaja he's only a hunting guide now practically a pauper stimulant should be taking effect he regained consciousness in a moment or two where's velda she's over the house sulking she'd pee because i wouldn't let her come here would you mind running over to the house cyril and keep an eye on her sure any reason why you didn't want her to come here i was uh well telling what a reaction might be uh besides take it easy relax you're gonna be all right pasta thank you doctor there's no pain and i know as you must the jungle drums beat the last minutes of my life that's nonsense no when the jungle drums stop i will be gone but your friend awaits your recovery he said many animals still tremble at the sight of your gun faster appreciate his presence and you said doctor your plans you still go into the jungle with your brother my plans remain unchanged i plan to leave as soon as possible you must not why shouldn't we go old man the years of youth always challenge the wisdom of age how can one explain that which is only acquired through experience why don't you get out jack you're annoying no let him remain saheeb as a man of medicine you have witnessed death many times perhaps the sight will join into believing what i must say you're exciting yourself draining your strength relax relax perhaps perhaps there is some way before the candle flickers lower that i may impress upon him the dire consequences of his love for the girl have you been talking to him about velder and me i'll be silly there's no knowledge he could give me that i do not already possess you in love with the creature who you believe in three short years has cleansed her blood of the primitive instincts reared by the gorilla tribe mothered by baboons and yet you would not believe that someday her soft caresses could turn into hairy steel claws around your throat i know of which i speak and feel the words must cut you like a blade but i too once reached for forbidden love and brought upon myself the curse of the llama you see the results now if you must go into the jungle leave her there easy leave her leave her for the beast from when she came if we go into the jungle it won't be to leave elder there it would be to satisfy a silly whim of my brothers cut it out jack velda told me what you did and i appreciate it but call her what you will gorilla girl a jungle creature it makes no difference we love each other perhaps my words will not bear fruit nor if they do will you heed them i can only ask that you grant me this last request i was young then and impetuous as you are a maharaja a man of great estate on a hunting expedition go a week in this wilderness and not one shot not a sign of anything moving did not the mightiest of hunters could unassure his maharaja that these were the best jungles in all the east it is impossible to explain your highness many times i have passed this way as a traveler never without seeing hundreds of animals is it possible they've been killed or perhaps died of natural causes this forest has never been hunted your highness it's it's almost as if as a port as if the beast sensed they were being hunted and and all had fled then my hunter would have me to believe that these wild beasts distinguish between the peaceful travelers and the maharaja of diary who shoots them for sport that that would make them different than any animals i have ever hunted perhaps your highness if if we pursued them this way (Sounds of the Jungle) (Dramatic Music) thou art indeed kind my child wait may the blessings of the three deities bring you good fortune and good hunting holy men you have great knowledge of all things i am very humble there is something we wish to know why no game appears in the sights of your gun how did you know you are not the first to try the hunting in this jungle all return home empty head and you assured me the game was plentiful more so than in any jungle in the east ah but the game is here in plenty but unless you come in peace you will never be aware of it how do you explain that the holy man told us of this boy who was reared by the animals such as velda he was their law their protector and so long as we remained in this jungle we were subject to his law if we disobeyed a curse would fall upon us and a member of our party would die the son of a great prince who traveled this jungle years ago the baby was reared by the animals so the people say he has become a brother to them have you seen him i have seen him thank you holy man what is your wish highness do you believe there may be something in what he says we'll camp here tonight and tomorrow from the moment i saw ronnie nothing else mattered but my desire for her all thoughts of my hunt vanished even the warning of the holy one which a moment before had sounded foreboding was now of little or no importance holy man that girl who brought your food who is she the daughter of rajan leader of our village and her name rani of good character and greek beauty find this rajan and bring him to my tent tonight yes and let us hope you are better at hunting men than wild beasts it may not sound plausible to you of the western world but the projected thought of a holy llama could have brought the disaster that was to befall us you mean the sabu fella was reared by animals not only was he reared by them but he lived with them as one he was so much an animal that he not only shared their thoughts but he spoke their language this curse would you explain it there is a law of the jungle which allows one to partake for necessity but the product that belongs must remain perhaps i was ruthless but i loved ronnie as much as you love velvet and i would let nothing sabu or the curse prevent me from obtaining that which i sought i waited for quran to bring the girl's father to me this is rajan highness you are improving quran perhaps we will find an animal yet after all you wished my presence highness what is your price highness for your daughter's hand ronnie i wish to marry her the daughter of a number man such as myself this is indeed the highest of honors well i have no price it is impossible no price she is not married she is betrothed if i had but no highness if i could have anticipated oh and i suppose you're a man of honor who cannot go back on his bargain even if i restore the man his goods and make you wealthy beyond your greatest dreams perhaps there is a way yes my son-in-law to be caddo is away on a pilgrimage to the mountain shrine perhaps if i've received word that he had been killed by a tiger a tiger in these jungles and if the wedding were to take place quickly when kedley returned we would be very sorry a mistake but too late to correct your wise man rajan interested in the daughter's happiness pay him his price whatever it is and bring the girl to me tomorrow oh father good your curry is just ready i'm afraid my appetite is not so good little one i bring you bad news bad news could they say he never reached the mountains on the jungle trail a tiger he's dead i know it is terrible little one but i bring good news also my little daughter is to be the bride of the maharaja it is all ranged little one imagine the daughter of the house of rajan a princess the deities are indeed kind in this hour of our sorrow no reni i will not i cannot marry cuddle i marry no one i would rather die let the tiger that towards flesh tear mine too ronnie granny and that's the story highness she ran into the jungle perhaps she is already dead if she encounters no more animals than we in our hunting she is perfectly safe besides a lone girl in the jungle should not be too hard to pursue hey quran not at all highness i could follow her anywhere but suppose she encountered sabu your hunters would be no magic silence the jungle boy interferes too often organize a search party take as many men as you need and i prefer my bride to be alive yes highness ronnie was determined in her desire to escape any possibility of marriage with me she did not fear the terrors of the jungle it seemed if only she could succeed in eluding me or my party members it may be that she was frightened but trusted to a hope of finding either sabu or her own cuddle i had ever faith in kuran oh i was confident he would track down the girl but i did not have the slightest hope we would ever capture the jungle boy did you in due time but not before ronnie told him of my presence and my intent he belonged to her kind i didn't i had convinced myself that quran's death was accidental all my men were killed or maimed but i was spared for even a much worse faith my empire was shattered easy i was left penniless and i wandered from continent to continent selling my services as a professional guide to other hunters i had come to the belt country with an expedition that would take me deep into gorilla country i had left the main party and was alone but the fascination of the hairy beast drove all caution from my mind a premonition of impending danger kept reminding me of the old llama's curse but even so i found myself getting further and further from the main party perhaps i was foolhardy going into the country of the bush gorilla that beast whom even the lion leaves along but i wanted a shot at one i found the guerrilla tracks and followed them for several miles without locating the animal from the sign i knew it must be a huge one and my blood began to pound hmm hmm all right ah uh when i fully regained my senses i saw her beside the gorilla where she came from i did not know and at first i thought she was but no it couldn't be i tore my glance from her i wanted my rifle because i was in a desperate situation thank you you know the rest sahib doctor we delivered the girl into your custody you have been ministering to my ailing health ever since i wish you all the blessings of the deities not the curse of the jungle there is no cursive jungle except to him who disobeys didn't i tell you to keep her home cyril look i tried i'm taking you back to that vel did not go until old man die get her out of here let her remain her kind sense the odor of death for many days she has known this hour was coming look arthur maybe there's still time why don't we take him to the hospital there is not time she is right there is very little time left i wish to breathe my last in the open uh i can see by the look in your eye nothing will prevent your trek into the jungle perhaps in my absence i can still be with you reach into my pocket my pocket what is it it's the eye of the jungle when i fled the land of sabu i found it and that shrunken head among my possessions there was an omen when the curse of the jungle is atoned only then can it be returned to the place from once it came i don't understand there are many things in the east that are secrets and cannot be comprehended by you people from the western world what do you want me to do with them take it with you on your journey perhaps it will perhaps it will influence your actions perhaps even my eternity what about the head leave the head here it is a symbol of death many times i have tried to lose it but it always reappears in the eye what if it never returns to believe is to be have faith so now these are the laws of the jungle and many in mighty are they for the head and the hoof or the law and the haunch is obeyed and now we had started on the safari i kept thinking of pasta the oh maharaja the eye of the jungle the shrunken head i marvel about the wonders of this dark continent this land of many contrasts for a few short miles could take you from thriving modern cities into uncharted treacherous wilderness i've been in africa a dozen or more years i knew its people in its dark mysterious ways i was not exactly new to the jungle either and yet there was something entirely different from any other trip i had made i knew it was because of velvet animals which ordinarily run or attack at the sight of a human intrusion seemed docile friendly curious it was as though they recognized belda as one of their own as we continued on i wondered about the old heredity environment angle as bella's thrust further into a jungle surroundings which you revert to a former self or would she remain a white girl i kept telling myself i had to know we spent the night on the brink of the zambezi river next morning cyril and i are up and once more marveling at the glories of this weird country jack and bella saw it too but on a different light are you happy with the safari folder much happy you're not worried or scared well they're not scared nothing hurt me this is my country your country is beautiful very beautiful it's gonna be hard to leave but you like our country america when we go check not go always stay with velda here of course i'll never leave you builder how do you think of me jack lavelda thought i love jack and protect him too jack's a lucky guy but he also likes a kiss now and then oh velda got many kisses for jack set me up for air selda like see my brother a minute africa is a fascinating country kind of overwhelms a fellow doesn't it we were not aware when the drums began to beat but as we watched belden i knew the rhythm and this weird dance something to do with death i remember this spot as a sacred burial ground the spears were grim reminders of departed warriors velda danced parentally till suddenly as if from nowhere the death's head appeared in her hands i recall pastor's words that it symbolized imminent death i felt cold and clammy wondering who it would be so so the safari took us deeper and deeper to a gorilla country but jack and velda was a sort of outing a lock to me it was a search for an answer to an ageless question could evolution have any basis could it influence the mating instinct of a girl whose life had been half gorilla and half civilized and yet i found myself in the defense of favela where did she come from how long have you been with the gorilla pack i try to remember the details of a missionary couple who had been killed in a safari in this back country about 10 or 12 years before they have a daughter was never found afterwards could it be she was that girl perhaps she was it was a long shot whatever the answer it might place the lives of four people in jeopardy a strange quiet came over the safari that is until we came into a clearing on the banks of the sabi river by now cyril was dehydrated but he wouldn't venture near the water's edge instead he decided to drink from a small stream which emptied into the river cyril drank hotel your water and we drank in the scenery as velda identified the various animals for us she told us of the velda beast an animal much like the buffalo back in the states we watched the ugly laughing hyenas that saw any prey left behind by other well-killed denisons of the forest she pointed out the kudu which to me resembled our mule deer the ponderous elephants are always fun to look at as is the impala which is the favorite food of the lion the zebras as usual were frisky and laughable to look at it seems nature made convicts of them for the moment i forgot my so-called psychological study of jungle versus civilization and stood spellbound by the rugged beauty and serenity of the strange country strange people strange animals to me this was the eternal fascination of africa but dark continent never failed to live up to the expectations i had the hippos seemed docile and gentle enough as they soaked up water and sun yet this provide their deadly qualities when encountered on the hoof they were dangerous and always ready to attack regardless of the interesting things always present we had to continue on our journey at last i was not exactly impatient but there was a problem in my mind waiting to be solved say doc one question yeah we're not going beyond the deeper villages are we i haven't made up my mind yet we might we're surely not in the gorilla country you know this safari could be a lot of fun if i could only forget that old maharaja's curse say you suppose it was anything to what he said you know people in this part of the world have done a puzzle of you and me for thousands of years back home in the states we dismiss them superstitions we wouldn't believe it no matter how it was presented but out here there's some things that seem perfectly natural my eyes have seen things that my mind refuses to accept yet i've seen them well you can tell me this is none of my business but seldom jack seemed perfectly natural and quite happy it looks as if you've rescued a drowning person and now you're throwing her back into the water well just got a chance to learn how to swim maybe i wanted to see if she could in fact i've gotta know she's been sort of a guinea pig hasn't she charted all her actions and reactions as she became civilized do you know it seems to me what seems to you cyril that we're in the midst of so much beauty that we shouldn't waste a minute of it safari going all right pretty good i guess how's velda taking it she's not disappointing me and you oh look i'm sorry jack i don't mean to pry into your private business i got nothing against velda it's just that there's a suspicion up here that i can't put down i could be wrong you sure could i intend to prove it although things were going consistently well there was always the possibility of danger lurking in the very next brush i'll take this one off it's all yours eagle eagle let's go later on in the trek we came upon an incident that was undoubtedly an ordinary occurrence for velvet we stood horrified spellbound here was the raw grim savagery of the jungle unfolding before our eyes the law of survival of the fittest and it was shocking cyril was watching with a sick expression jack winston but he seemed incapable of doing anything they were all frozen and revulsive alexa velda they caught the look on her face it was fixed and stalled almost a smirk she was watching something which to her was an old story linus must eat we came out of the brush country and saw the ruins of the zimbabwe directly ahead the yamahosa is a tribe that was neither hostile in a civilized inhabited the ruins but the gun away jack wouldn't do any good if those who bullies want to start trouble why don't we leave before they see us i'm afraid they already have those dancers they puzzle me it was a curious mixture of cannibal and modern touches in that dress yet they were known for their ferocity toward other tribes we were reluctant to go closer particularly with veldo long besides it seemed they were having a big meeting of some kind with other natives i had heard that a renegade white a notorious nairobi smith lived among them as their leader seemed strange that a white man would forsake his own to live among the natives so i wondered if he was behind the marmars do you think those natives would object to having their pictures taken i don't think so they're used to the white men and just be sure you tell them how you want to be cooked cyril pot foil fricaseed or well stewed well i'm second thought i think i should save my film go ahead cyril he's kidding you he is why you young tick squeak you're not daughty my courage pretty good stuff though say dog maybe i only get one or two shots come on cyril i'll go with you you will you will i was amazed that jack would leave velda with me he was by her side so constantly but at the moment i was more concerned with these mixed dances and wondered if possibly nairobi smith had anything to do with this gathering could be he was trying to stir them up there was a rumor that narobi hated his own people get a couple of shots for the armor oh loops them bookers gorilla hunters why do they dance not ordinary dance gorilla dance bad why is it bad every year gorilla come for sacrifice for girls i'm going to see the chief present for you um hello let's get out of here hello what's the matter that cyril run out of film i think you better go arthur one of the natives got a glimpse of velda and they say i'm sorry honey they recognized us being part of the gorilla pack and they said unless we left they'd take our prisoners and then lolly walk would leave them alone who's lolly what villain him leader of gorilla my pet hunter shoot him when he found me what do we do i guess we'd better go okay come on foreign foreign i had a premonition of trouble as we left the village i thought i could read between the lines of jack's explanation but somehow i felt it had a connection with nairobi smith i don't like it i got a funny feeling when i've wandered around here what do we do arthur let's get moving oh we're being followed we better find us a spot before our ambush let's go foreign let let go okay narobi you're all washed up i'm taking you into the nearest constabulary in evil that's the sally village the last one we passed before we hit gorilla country are the natives friendly very friendly me and the chief are good friends i spent a couple of months here once delivered a whole batch of babies uh bella do you know them i don't know them you'd better stay here with jack why can't we take her along with us well it might prevent some excitement i don't mean it hurt or anything it's just that they might get upset okay i'll stay no jack go velda wait here not afraid jack go okay cyril let's go get the imo out for me we received a friendly welcome from the village there was much here of interest and cyril had his typical reaction he was a real camera bug i watched jack slyly i thought he might be disturbed mentally if he was he showed no signs we were fascinated by the color of the various natives each symbol of a stage in their lives the paint long skirt and blouses represented their marriageable status and the peculiar designs of the war-like paint on their faces told a message to all the eligible males a stranger in that midst could tell in sight whether he confronted a married woman a betrothed a one who was in search of a mate the naked torso painted with red bola or clay meant that she is engaged in betrayal primitive as it seemed it was practical and well conceived much like our american indian the native women carried their bohara or babies on their backs i thought of jack but not that he was watching cyril whose manner of fun was contagious enough to take jack's mind off felder at least for the time being this bevy of girls was in the custody of the village witch doctor but that made no difference to cyril he killed it with them and the witch doctor took it good naturally everybody laughed heartily i recognize these two as bon banas of a neighboring tribe they were the tallest in africa almost seven feet that's the chief over there i'll be right back fellas i had a lengthy talk with my friend the old chief he told me the gorillas have gotten worse each year since velda was taken from him they were meaner wilder they hadn't attacked the usally however this was probably because of you sally were fighting men always training for the possibility of battle the chief invited us to watch some of his warriors foreign cyril was having more fun than the natives and kitted with them apparently they shared his enthusiasm for they giggled and laughed at his antics suddenly they started to beat a rhythm by clapping their hands the chief told me this meant the war games were about to start the wild rhythm was contagious and cyril fell into the sway of it as he convulsed a few of the natives with his version of the ball in the jack laughs oh oh university the time had come to leave so i had the old chief farewell he invited me back to the village but i had a sneaking suspicion he had another baby crop about doom let's call it a day boys and get moving come on we didn't realize how long we'd stayed in the village until we left had a peculiar premonition as we needed the spot where gold awaited a rather waited because she was gone something's happened to velda she's gone i expected that i only wonder it didn't happen before now what are you talking about ah forget it what do we do now well i'm for getting out of here what do you say son let's go home while we're ahead well go on home as far as i'm concerned the two of you can go straight too i'm gonna find velda valder why don't you tell him doc he's got a right to know i've got a right to know what listen kid brother i never told you everything this pastor's doctor he revealed things to me that i felt obligated to keep from you but now i'm gonna give it to you both barrels whether you like it or not why don't you wake up wake up to what wake up from a nightmare there are things happening around here that the outside world never heard of but the fact remains they're here and we're here these natives have been sacrificing women their gorillas for ages what's that got to do with felder what do you suppose she came from she might not have been a sacrifice maiden but she lived like one do you expect me to buy that i don't care whether you buy it or not i bought it on the lips of a dying man harster they're all well to live with them two and a half years what did you expect he educated it she revealed every little intimate detail do i have to go on go on he learned from velda that the natives have been sacrificing virgins to guerrillas and what's more shocking these maidens consider it an honor if one does escape the natives avoider like the plague and yet no one of them has ever been found dead are you insinuating bella spent most of her life with the gorilla pack i think she's gone home return to her animal instinct boy you better give yourself a pill she's all woman i oughta know why don't you wise up jack she's not a woman she's a beast i ought to break you into but you're out of your head thanks you're not gonna let him go out there alone are you gonna let him get himself killed but i brought him here let's go so lolliwog no remember velda belda come to tell lollywog velda go away come uh so oh i don't like it it's too quiet just a chimp but that isn't don't move he's bluffing shall we follow him oh wait a minute what do we do now go on ahead find a clearing make a camp until it gets a little dark he must have fell asleep what time is it it's about 10 o'clock the moon's up but it ought to be good and dark by midnight and we can take off then where's cyril taking the first watch i'm gonna relieve him about 15 minutes thriller oh he didn't have a chance (Dramatic Music) (Dramatic Music) that's felder come on (Dramatic Music) (Dramatic Music) (cawing) i don't get it some sort of a ritual (Dramatic Music) okay i've seen it but i still don't think beld is any part (drumming music) see how he's doing bella listen jack this ape's afraid of a gun as soon as one of them makes a lunge you and bella make a break for it (Dramatic Music) ahh! now these are the laws of the jungle and many and mighty are they for the one who shall make it may prosper but the one who breaks it must die (Dramatic Music)
