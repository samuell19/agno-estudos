from the Archive of Deutsche Kinemathek foundation In the Ruhr region In the Ruhr region which is around 60 km long and 25km wide there are 12 cities. 6.5 million people live here I work in the iron- and steel tube works. Our families are in Turkey. I work in the iron- and steel tube works at the automatic system. I earn 5 Mark 25 per hour. I have been saving up, thank God! My kids and family are in my homeland, they are well. My work is very good. We live in barracks. Beginning of next year, I want to go home if Allah is willing. This is Karl Heinz Oppenberg, a saddler. He has an hourly wage of 4 Marks 50. As far as I am concerned, I can say that I have worked for 33 years at the Schattbacher Rosenblumendelle or respectively Hagenbeck. In 1934 I, was encouraged to work below ground as a builder, a bricklayer. There I carried out mining operations myself as a so called "Lehr".. "Lehrhauer". and as a "Gedingeschrippe". Had carried out almost all mining operations. Then during the war, as the big war was raging here and the houses were being destroyed by the Allied' bombings, I was brought in for the construction of houses, meaning repairs in the mining workers' apartments. There one experienced and saw a lot: how they rebuilt their apartments to find themselves shelter again. The whole time, I myself am a staff council member in a metal cast factory. From my work as a mining worker under ground, I can also talk about the Schottanlage Hagenbeck: In the year 1939, just before Christmas, as is usual, happen in the mining work bigger accidents before the Christmas holidays. This is a sign that the miner in this month of December works especially hard time and time again to have a lot of money for the family vacation and to make good Christmas presents. On the other hand, Hagenbeck, 5 miners were killed In the seam "Sonnenschein" (sun shine). Of them, we have only gotten out two, dead. That means they were buried there in the Essen region. The three other comrades are still lying under ground because there had been no way of rescuing them no way at all to get to the dead comrades. The whole mountain range of the mine was collapsed and again and again new breaks showed. The administration however had to leave the entire rescue area and still no coal was mined for in that area. Have been living here for around thirty years. and there is a landfill nearby where the stones from the mine are driven off. It has been burning since '47 or '46. And even though the whole neighborhood has complained about it, and the city administration has tried everything, with water and things like that, they don't succeed in extinguishing it. Now they have moved on to clearing away the landfill. And when the excavators are working over there, clouds rise up and dirty everything with dust and dirt. The neighborhood has always complained but there's nothing to be done until the landfill is gone. Now half of it has been cleared away. Hopefully then we will have peace The humans in this world have everything at their disposal from the natural sciences to the technology, the sciences. The humans also have at their disposal to help other human beings in their social and personal needs. To be in charge of all things in this world one however needs a crucially decisive amount of freedom. And this freedom we Christians have to make believable in this world especially through our behavior. Freedom is not just the freedom of thought. Freedom is not just a vague feeling. What freedom is, is determined there and then. That's why the Christian has to decide there and then. He has to make believable there and then what freedom is. The denomination to Jesus Christ doesn't exist in a vacuum. Therefore it is regrettable what we have to read in our church newspaper "Der Weg" (the way). In this newspaper that at any rate is one of the most important newspapers of our regional church, is reported how a Swedish priest goes to the factory to inform himself there and then about the workers' social problems. But then there is written the following statement: "Whether the sincere efforts of the church for the workers will amount to visible results for the communities is uncertain. The American evangelist Billy Graham however addresses many people in mass events without a regard for specific problems of the individual and in this way calls for the the denomination to Jesus Christ with success. Here we have to ask: "Is this possible? To reach the denomination of Jesus Christ with no specific regard for the problems of the individual? Does this denomination exist in a vacuum? What's more important? A mass event where the American evangelist Billy Graham gathers together thousands of people in front of his microphones? Or the Christians' efforts around the people's social problems in our society where one does not immediately see a great and apparent result. Christians have to take care of the social problems with calmness and perseverance. Here and there they can make their freedom believable. But if Christians aren't capable of dealing with social questions, then also their belief and denomination to Jesus Christ is without worth. We however know that Christ has given us the freedom the freedom, to deal with these problems and that's why we have to make use of this freedom. Grabich, formerly a miner, was part of the red Ruhr Army in 1920. Yes, you want from me some pictures from the past and especially from the Kapp-Putsch and how it played out here in the Ruhr area I ask you to consider that since then yes 47 years have passed since this time. I stand in the eightieth year of life and that then the memory isn't so fresh anymore as it would have been 20 maybe 30 years ago. But as good as I can remember, I will describe some details from back then. Already the year 1920 confronted the workers with difficult big questions. The workers'- and soldiers' councils that were founded after the collapse in 1918 had long been disposed off. The reaction had recovered and came crawling out of its mouse hole and was soon again firmly in the saddle. Black clouds were looming over Germany. Fascist organizations sprouted up. "Einwohnerwehren", organisations like like "Konsul" "Orgesch" "Stahlhelm" (steel helmet) and volunteer corps were formed everywhere to protect the alleged civil freedom. Besides the 100.000 man army which was granted to the Germans by the peace treaty a so called black "Reichswehr" was formed. The same hired volunteers which were briefly drilled and always replaced with new contingents. The central point of the training and the trade was the fortress Küstrin. A prematurely attempted coup from there made the entire world sit up and revealed the military's secret plans. The ruling circles were very shocked about this coup which to them seemed premature and had it suppressed. The 13th of March Kapp and Lüttwitz marched into Berlin with their white troops, declared the government for deposed and took over the power and declared martial law. The previous government of Ebert, Scheidemann, Noske and others had to flee and settled down in Stuttgart. I was given the order to destroy the police warehouse on Bottroper Street Difficult to access here because of a railway embankment in front. The security police had settled here. Because a total attack wouldn't achieve anything, I ordered a bypass behind the old Jewish cemetery on Hammerstreet. Encircled like this, they had no choice but to flee towards Bottrop. But obvious weapon material and ammunition fell into our hands. Leaving behind an appropriate garrison, we advanced against Mühlheim. There, free corps' Schulz commanding officer hoisted the black-white- red flag and decided on Watter, that meant, against the proper government After a short, but violent fight, the majority fled towards Duisburg. Heavy fights continued in the mountains of Saarn. After violent fights with the Duisburg and hamborn workers, only a small part reached the protecting walls of Wesel. Already after the fights near Sarn, I was called back to Essen and handed over the Essen troops to my friend Reinhold. In Essen a gang of mob and rabble had spread was generating a panic mood. with robberies and thefts. I was appointed security officer of the city of Essen. Quickly, out of the remaining younger and older workers, I raised a security force that took turns day and night. After the Bielefeld Agreement the front started to crumble that until then had stuck together. Fighting we retreated over Buhr, Bottrop and Essen. In old Essen still, heavy fights took place. So one can in fact say that the resistance of the workers against Hitler wasn't completely useless, that it also brought successes. Looking back now, one comes to the conclusion that already back then it showed, how necessary the resistance was. Today it is like this, that many still live off what back then the resistance groups and among them one can probably name the communists as the strongest group, the socialists, the trade unionist, achieved. For example, I remember when we were prosecuted by Hitler. Hitler had risen to power. A part of the middle class celebrated because they believed their Messiah had come. Even so, there were groups of workers that didn't want to change these times just with the fists in their pockets. And here I recall amongst other things how even in the police there were people of the resistance. In Cologne from example, I had been transferred from Thuringia to Cologne because I belonged to the central resistance group, after my arrest a police man basically released me from the Gestapo ill-treatments by breaking his client's trust opening the door one morning and I basically escaped the beatings of the gestapo and the interrogations because of this. Then I was brought to Bonner Wall, that used to be a military prison. From there the stations went over Brauweiler, Börgermoor. And when I came back from Börgermoor already resistance groups had formed here in Mühlheim. And Johann, we were probably the responsible bodies or the first organizers of the union of the resistance groups here in Mühlheim. Maybe now you could explain how things were back then. This is Johann Adelhütte, craftsman. Günther Daus, architect, 1945-1947 he was communist mayor in Mühlheim Ruhr. Herrmann Rosendhal, formerly miner. And back then we also received the written documents. We printed here ourselves, we still had some appliances where you could hectograph, duplicate and we distributed or let these writings be distributed and... then there were also in the individual suburbs the individual groups or the individual groups were made one and in doing so I met Herrmann again and we asked him then to now also help out and he confirmed what we had assumed. That in the Ruhr area, already as well people had come together or had a connection amongst themselves and so the same thing happened here in the entire city area. Until 1934 when because of the thoughtlessness or today I would like to say well through the distri- bution of the writings it was easy for the Gestapo to then neutralize this group in the entire situation and to then put on trial. That was a dark time, that we then experienced, but the resistance continued and also developed. Because we know that also in 1943 arrests were made here in Mühlheim who then had to pay dearly. It was truly a bad time back then The.. antifascists back then were had to, they had to retreat the SA gained the upper hand. We were then, I was lying in bed at night all of a sudden the house was encircled. I was taken out, I had no time to dress, I was wearing only pants. And then it started. Thrashings up to a pub where there used to be SA. There again we had to go through a lane, I was among the first. And. And there then it went on. They had roof battens in their hands, you had to jump over them and when you didn't get over... you never got over then they came for the shins. I had the misfortune that someone kicked me in the testicles. I couldn't walk at all anymore. At about eight in the morning we were brought to the Brown House in the city centre. It was around 20 minutes away. But almost everyone couldn't walk anymore and from there then the Standard Leaders gave our names to the Brown House. Then we were put in a barracks, in a gymnasium. There we stayed until until the wounds had somewhat subsided. I was unlucky enough to have to stay eight days. And there already we made the decision in the gym that we would have to come closer together so what happened there could not happen again. When we walked back to town the population took no interest as was later said that they were happy that Adolf Hitler would come to power instead they turned around, they didn't want to see us because we were so battered. Tears were running down people's cheeks. And so we came in the evening and night. At 12 when it was dark I was released, then I could go home. I have been working in a textile factory for three years. I am happy with my work. At the same time, I am supporting my parents. The big problem is the language. For some time I have been learning to understand German a little bit. I have been in Germany for about 3 years. I am the father of five children. To live with my sons, that have been here for about seven years. We came to find work. For a certain time it went decently well here in Germany. But now it's beginning to get worse. For example, two of my children had to emigrate to Australia. We hope that the situation will improve, but so far one sees no improvement Unfortunately, we are also treated a bit poorly, especially those who haven't yet mastered the language. Like this, we are at a disadvantage in everything. For around ten years we have had here in our state the mining crisis. In our city and on the mine where I work. Tomorrow is its last shift. This mine has existed for almost over hundred years. These last ten years of the crisis have left their marks on this city. Almost 15.000 commuters. Workers, that only sleep within the walls of this city, have to look for work outside these walls. We were told here about structural change, about the introduction of new industries. There were 10 years of time to introduce the structural change here. Only now one is still talking and it has been like that for 10 years. Just the replacement industries are simply not following. On top of this, it has to be clear that if other industries are to be settled in this area, you also have to know which industries that should be. So that this industry's production are still saleable. The help and the expectations that the people in this state put on the government - you know that we have a social-democratic state government, and one could have been of faith that these people's sufferings should or would have an end - see themselves badly deceived. Just recently the Bundesrat I think it was the day before yesterday rejected the aid measures and the bonus that were pending especially with the plants Hansa and Pluto those things again rejected so that one can't expect help from this side either. The importation from the US I think it's around six million tons. If those could be stopped it would mean the continuance for a longer time of many people's jobs. Aid measures however at the level that one should live off mandate millions, in the long term, won't be an aid measure for the Ruhr area What's missing here are places of employment and a fast structural change in the Ruhr area. But what hasn't been managed in 10 years and probably wasn't willing to manage we won't be able to manage in the next ten months either. So, it keeps going downhill here. And where the workers will march then we will surely live to see. But this is not just the case with mining but the people on the Ruhr have to be in the clear on the fact that that which is happening in Ruhr what is happening with mining is going to spread over on other industries and will there too find its expression. Therefore it will be a struggle with no end. I think that the workers in this country and not just here but whether it be whether it be in the US whether it be in France whether it be in Sweden whether it be anywhere else have to join together more closely to defend their common social and economic cause. And to better face the concentration of power in the economic power.
