[HIND] What people see on TV is that women who lived under Islamic State are very submissive. They're housewives... [INDISTINCT YELLING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] This is crazy, because these kids are saying that they are going to bring back Islamic State. Islamic State will not stop. [DISTORTED] You basically just... made money for doing nothing: um, a phone call and some research online. These kids did what with the money they stole? [MAN] They took helicopter flights to dinner. They bought $5,000 watches. They rented mansions.

[SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [HIND] There are rooms all the way down the corridor. Each room can contain over 150 men. We've seen people from Iraq, Germany, Russia, and even the United States. It smells really bad, like a combination of human sweat, feces, and urine. ♪♪♪ There are at least 5,000 prisoners here from up to 30 countries. Many are European citizens whose governments don't want them back. - Were you a fighter? - Yes, I was a fighter. - So you are a terrorist? - Yeah, of course. [HIND] How would they know that you're not gonna continue the fight for ISIS or continue spreading the ideals? Bcause number one, I surrender myself. - I am finished with it. - [HIND] You had no choice. No, it's not true. I could fight till the end. Everybody know ISIS fighters, they fight till the end. ♪♪♪ [HIND] Casper Hansen is from Denmark and is one of the highest-level detainees here. Prison guards say he commanded ISIS fighters on the battlefield and was injured in a targeted air strike. Do you know what they say about you? [CASPER] No. That you're an emir. - An emir? - An Islamic State prince. Okay. [LAUGHS] - Did you work? - No, no. [HIND] And your wife, did she work? [CASPER] No, she was in the house. [HIND] She didn't work. How important is the woman's role? They must have done something beyond just staying in the house, because I can't imagine... What are you imagining, then? That they had more of a role. Like what, being fighters? Maybe. No, they didn't allow women to fight. I know that. There were some women, they was teaching the religious methods. It's about raising your children to learn the Islamic, uh, laws. Will Islamic State re-form? Do you believe that it will? Islamic State will not stop. To be continued. [GUNFIRE] [HIND] It was a year ago that ISIS was on the verge of defeat. The terror group that, at its peak, controlled more than 34,000 square miles of Iraq and Syria was cornered in Baghuz, a tiny village along the Euphrates River. Sixty thousand fled the final battle. Men were hauled off to prisons. Women and children were loaded into trucks and transported to refugee camps. - [GUN COCKING] - [MAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [HIND] Today the Islamic State remains active. In Deir ez-Zor, U.S. Special Forces are training Kurdish and Arab militias to hunt down fighters hiding out in villages across Syria. [GUNFIRE] But a growing threat is the ISIS women inside Al-Hol, a massive refugee camp near the Iraqi border. There's 65,000 residents here from 45 different countries, half of them children, but they're not all ISIS. Many are victims themselves and are now forced to live with women who security officials say are becoming more radical by the day. ♪♪♪ We're with the Kurdish intelligence inside Al-Hol Camp. They're about to carry out a raid targeting women who they believe are part of an ISIS patrol which teaches, maintains, and enforces the extremist ideology in the camp. ♪♪♪ These operations are actually incredibly dangerous because the women that they're targeting are known to be some of the most violent women inside this camp. [WOMEN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ [HIND] Do you know why they brought you in here? [UMM SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] What we've been told is that there are women like yourself inside the camp who are enforcing ISIS' ideology on other women and on... [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] Do you regret coming here to join the Islamic State? Do you want to live under an Islamic State again? [HIND] With little evidence against her, camp intelligence released Umm Hamza just hours after this raid. These women say that they're not doing anything; they're just sitting inside their tents and raising their children and that these accusations are false. How do you respond to that? [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] What happens if there's no resolution for this problem? [HIND] There's just about 400 security personnel guarding this sprawling camp, and officials are outnumbered. One of the challenges they face is finding out who's radical and who isn't. Leila Ouadi from France has been targeted by women who patrol the camp and enforce strict ISIS laws against wearing makeup and socializing with men. Have they attacked you personally? [SPEAKING FRENCH] Have you heard about them doing it to other women? [HIND] Leila doesn't live in the camp alone. She's stuck here with her four children with little access to medicine and food. And there may be no way out. France, like other European governments, is making it nearly impossible for their citizens to return home. What are you afraid of, bringing them up in the camp? If they don't get out, what are you afraid will happen to them? ♪♪♪ [HIND] Do you take responsibility for the situation that your children are in? ♪♪♪ [HIND] We've managed to get access to a women's prison, and this is the first time that they're going to allow journalists to go inside and film. Some of the women that are being held there are actually too dangerous to be kept in the camps, and so instead they've been transferred to this detention center. Here the women are placed in individual cells and kept under 24-hour surveillance, some along with their children. ♪♪♪ Prison guards selected three foreign detainees for us to speak to. Do you know why you're here in this prison? [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [HIND] Can you talk me through how you ended up here? [SPEAKING ENGLISH] [HIND] Do you know why you're here? [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] What was it like when you were living in the Islamic State during the time just before you entered the camp? How was it not like that? Was this a big change, in your opinion, of ISIS and their ideology? You're accused of trying to smuggle explosives into the camp. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Yeah. [SPEAKING ENGLISH] That's stupid? The role of women is also to teach the children the ideology of ISIS. Is that right? ♪♪♪ [HIND] Women passing on the ideology to children is one of the most urgent concerns for security officials. Eleven-year-old Malek was held captive by an ISIS woman inside Al-Hol. She was rescued by camp security just days ago and is now being cared for by a foster family. ♪♪♪ She's Yezidi, a religious minority that ISIS vowed to wipe out. [WOMAN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [HIND] For six years, Malek lived under the Islamic State. After her mother and sister were killed in an air strike, she was taken in by an ISIS woman who tried to erase her past. [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [CHICKENS CLUCKING] Okay. Gonna show us where she sleeps. No. Cu-cuckoo-koo! [HIND] She's been here now for a couple of weeks, and she's clearly become accustomed to living here. She's not what I expected at all when they told me that there was an 11-year-old girl who'd been living with ISIS families and was in the camp and was getting rescued. It's nice to see her acting like any other 11-year-old. The next step for her is going to meet her real family. [LAUGHS] ♪♪♪ [HIND] Malek is fortunate. She's no longer in the hands of ISIS. But for many of the children still inside the camp, their future is uncertain. Here the ideology is spreading fast, and security is carrying out weekly raids to try and contain it. [WOMEN SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] [HIND] One of the ways they do that is by gathering intelligence from informants living inside Al-Hol. That information has led security officials to the far corner of the camp, where they suspect is an ISIS school. So this woman coming out now who they've handcuffed is apparently one of the ISIS women teaching the children extremist ISIS ideology. ♪♪♪ The camp security may be fighting a losing battle. As they try and root out the teachers, there's already a new generation in the making. [SPEAKING NATIVE LANGUAGE] ♪♪♪ [DARK MUSIC] [ANONYMOUS] There is no one criteria for a target. I view it as, like, a hunt, man. It's like a hunt. If you've ever been hunting, you understand what it feels like to track down your target and fucking kill it. I mean, you basically just... made money for doing nothing: um, a phone call and some research online. ♪♪♪ [ROBERT] I had never heard of a SIM swap before. I mean, these days are really a challenge... every day. You know, sometimes I... I wake up and it's hard to get out of bed. So when it first happened, October 26th, I didn't sleep that night. I was up with AT&T the entire night. ♪♪♪ I mean, you know, I was... I mean, I was suicidal. What brings me down is worry, worry that I can't meet the tuition for my daughter. Within, like, 20 minutes, a million dollars was stolen. I can't even believe I made a million dollars, let alone lost a million dollars. I mean... Quite a lot of victims were completely caught by surprise. [KRISHNA] Allison Nixon specializes in cybercrime and risk intelligence. SIM swapping is a technique where criminals basically steal your phone number, and all of the text messages and calls and information intended for your phone now go to their phone. And why is that important? Well, it's important because your entire online identity nowadays rests on your phone number. Your phone number is tied to your physical phone via this, a SIM card, a little microchip with a unique ID that your telephone company has on file. To do a SIM swap, a hacker gets a cell phone employee to switch the SIM card number that's linked to your phone to a phone they have. [ALLISON] They can do anything with your phone number that you would do, so imagine you forgot your password legitimately and you need to get back into your bank account. Banks, web mail providers, they have an account recovery process for customers that forget their passwords. Since they have my phone number, they can get into my email. Most web mail providers nowadays either require or strongly encourage that you hand over your phone number. I... I have little to no technical expertise. I'm hacking people, not computers. It takes a certain type of person, but it's not a genius. You don't have to be outstandingly intelligent. You just have to know how to do it and have the will to do it. [ROBERT] It's not like a regular hack. Unsophisticated kids can do devastating damage. [UPBEAT DANCE MUSIC] Nick Truglia is a 21-year-old. He stole a million dollars from me. [KRISHNA] What's, like, the spending habits of these SIM swappers? What we were seeing was basically the infinite-money fantasy of every 21-year-old. They would go to the club, waste tons of money, show it off on social media. [ANONYMOUS] Some of the stupid ways I can think we've spent our money: took a helicopter from Queens to Manhattan to get to dinner just because we felt like it. [ALLISON] They would all stand in a circle with their really expensive Rolexes and dump this champagne onto their Rolexes onto the floor. [ANONYMOUS] I probably spent, like, $1/4 million on champagne. [KRISHNA] So how much are you worth? Um, I won't say an exact amount, but it's, uh, under $90 million USD and over $40 million, all in Bitcoin. ♪♪♪ [KRISHNA] For hackers on the hunt for a big payday, SIM swapping turns robbery into child's play. [ANONYMOUS] So it all really started out with a bunch of kids playing Call of Duty around, ooh, I want to say 2013. People started wanting these things called OG accounts on PlayStation. So imagine you're a kid playing a video game and someone shows up in your game and their username is just Hacker. Like, no numbers after it, nothing, just the word "hacker." It's just sort of like a... a status thing. So we would call up PlayStation Network. We'd have their name, address, and all their personal info, and we would try to get... get their accounts. [KRISHNA] And once you had that OG username, you could sell it to someone else through an online marketplace. [ALLISON] The big sellers on these username markets have realized that the only feasible way to get good stock to sell is to steal accounts. At some point, somebody realized that video games and social media are really only worth so much and if they want to make more money, they really need to start targeting cryptocurrency, where they can make hundreds of millions of dollars. [KRISHNA] Cryptocurrencies are virtual gold mines. Sure, OG usernames could net a few thousand dollars, but digital wallets of Bitcoin and Ethereum could be swiped just as easily. [ANONYMOUS] So there was this one time me and my buddy were scrambling before this guy, like, tries to get his account back, before he gets his cell phone number back, and, uh, my partner obviously just made, like, roughly $10 million to $15 million. He says, "Oh, yeah, I gotta go." I said, "Why?" He says, "Oh, I gotta do my fucking homework." I thought... I thought it was really funny. [EERIE MUSIC] [SAMY] Last year, we didn't even know what it was, and 98 percent of cops would have no idea, if a victim came to them, what happened and how to investigate it. [KRISHNA] Since 2015, it's estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars have been stolen by SIM swapping, but only a handful of SIM swappers have ever been caught. [JOHN] I would say the majority of cases we go into, it's kids living with their parents. And so a lot of times, we will run into a mom who thinks all their son is doing is gaming or just happens to be very brilliant at Bitcoin investment and that's the reason he bought her a brand-new Toyota or something like that. [KRISHNA] In November 2018, they caught Nick Truglia, the young man accused of stealing over a million dollars from Rob Ross. Truglia did have a social media presence, with him flying on private jets and showing fancy clothing and fancy watches. He definitely was portraying himself as a rich guy and, like, a self-made millionaire, possibly, like, through, like, investment banking. But we came to find out that everything he posted online about himself was just a lie. [KRISHNA] The criminal case of alleged SIM swapper Nick Truglia is still ongoing. [MAN] The court is going to deny the motion to reset bail. [KRISHNA] He maintains his innocence and is currently awaiting trial. ♪♪♪ But careful SIM swappers are usually harder to pin down. Richard Sanders cofounded CipherBlade, a blockchain investigation agency that, among other things, uses SIM swappers' social engineering tactics... pretending to be someone they're not... to take them down. [RICHARD] This is a flow of transactions from an influencer that experienced a hack. This was a team of three to four folks. They split up the money, and they sent it to different wallets from there. ♪♪♪ So I pretended to be a very, very attractive 19-year-old female video gamer named Alyssa. I joined their Discord server and just started chatting with these folks. They're sliding into my DMs. They're telling me pretty much anything I wanted to know. Showing off their money. I would ask, "How are you making that money?" They'd talk about SIM swapping. Yeah, a bunch of them are talking to me, but one of them sent me quite a few different selfies. There's DMs he sent me where he admits to what he did. And sure enough, he sends me this picture. Joel Ortiz. [TENSE MUSIC] [KRISHNA] In May 2019, a group of hackers targeted more than 50 victims, stealing over $35 million. Ortiz was one of them... brazen, prolific, and now accountable for ten felonies. Rob Ross attended a public hearing where his accusers were allowed to make victim statements. [ROBERT] I think all SIM swap victims who have lost money are watching this Joel Ortiz trial and certainly the SIM swappers are watching it to see how much time he will end up having to serve. In my case, Ortiz stole control of my phone service twice to take over all of my email and financial accounts, ultimately stealing my entire life savings, approximately $1.8 million. [ANN MARIE] We lost everything. I'm 50 years old with two small children, and I ha... I'm facing no retirement... ♪♪♪ ... because Joel Ortiz, in one day, destroyed our lives, everything we spent decades building. ♪♪♪ [KRISHNA] Ortiz pleaded no contest to the charges and, in accordance with his plea deal, was sentenced to ten years in prison. But prosecutors have failed to get him to reveal the location of Bitcoin they suspect he's hidden. [MAN] Given that he stole at least $7 million that we know about, we believe that he has significantly more than $2 million that he refuses to return. And Joel Ortiz will likely leave jail with over $4 million at age 24. [WOMAN] Ooh! ♪♪♪ [ANONYMOUS] If I were to go to jail, um, it really wouldn't be that many years. It's not like murder. It's really just, like, a decade at... at... at most is what people look at, and then even then, I would still have my money when I got out because it's Bitcoin. Um, they can't... it's not like a bank account. They can't take the money. I mean, obviously it would suck to go to jail for a decade, but, um, uh, the way I have everything set up, I don't think that'll happen. [KRISHNA] As the tactics of SIM swappers continue to evolve, victims are now starting to fight back. Michael Terpin lost $24 million in a SIM swap. Now he's suing AT&T for letting this happen. People don't realize that most of the AT&T stores that say AT&T aren't actually owned by AT&T. They're licensed, and yet they have the same access, um, as an employee would to critical information that will let anybody be bribed for about $100. There's over 1,000 cases just from AT&T alone that one group is investigating. They've basically said they don't take responsibility for security; that's not their job. [KRISHNA] Early this year, three senators and three representatives wrote a letter to the FCC, pressuring them to take on SIM swap fraud. Vice reached out to AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. Sprint didn't get back to us. The others declined to be interviewed on camera. But AT&T did provide us with a statement. The irony is rich here because phone numbers were collected as a way to make accounts more secure. And now they are a back door for accounts. ♪♪♪ My endgame? [LAUGHS] There's... there's no endgame. It's just... the goal... the goal is just to make as much money as possible. I just want to be happy. That's... that's really it.
