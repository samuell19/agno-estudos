TOEI CENTRAL FILM, Presents MA NO TOKI (Moment of Demon) What boat is coming in to Pier One? We just had a call from Naokichimaru so it must be nearby. Get out of the way! This is not a place for tourists! Fukashi... Fukashi... Fukashi... I don't know who you are? Stop pretending to know me. Stop following me! Fukashi... Fukashi... What? I want to shout out loud. What? I don't know, but think if I shout out loud, I may know what it is. Are you going hysterical? Or are you blackmailing me? No! I don't know... I'm in a bind because I don't know what it is. Stop crying. Shall we get something to eat? Excuse me? I'm going out to breakfast! Don't oversleep at the motel! How impressive of you so early in the morning! You finally are able to eat your carrots. You're eating the dried fish as well. I'm so proud of you. It's nothing to be proud of. I just can't be picky. I need to be strong to be able to work. Another callous? You still can't shake this habit. Stop it. Stop acting so cuddly. They're all watching you. They may not seem like they are but they're all watching. I'm sorry. You really stick out like a sore thumb here. You're not out shopping in Ginza. I drove all night from Tokyo and I just got here. It's not as if I dressed up for this. You should know that. What? I was admiring your beauty. But why are you here? How did you know I was here? You work at Naokichimaru, right? They owner's daughter called me to check on your background. Did something happen between you and her? No. It's unusual to check on a part-timer's background. Unless something happened... Be quiet! How's your husband? He got an offer to work in the New York office for3 or4 years and he'd be promoted when he returns to Japan. That's great. Aren’t you going with him? No. Why not? You're his wife. I'm leaving him. Actually I left him already. I apologized and left. I couldn't hide what I had done. He won't give me a divorce because that would have a negative effect on his transfer, but I'm not going to New York with him anyway... Why? We used to hold hands a walk together before. Think about where we are! You never know who could be watching! I'm sorry. This is such a beautiful place. I've been thinking... I ran away from home and went all over Japan, but I could never settle down. But I felt so comfortable when I moved here. I think I like the feel of the environment here. It seems as if they’d let me get away with anything. I think that's why I felt so relieved. Please leave. Go home to your husband and go with him to New York. You have no right to tell me what to do. This feels so good. I feel so relieved here. Maybe I'll just move here. Leave! Don't interfere with my life! Don't ruin what I have! What? Kiss me. Stop teasing me. I'll kill you! Don't ever come near me! Do you understand? Watch where you're going! You're going to the motel too often! I'm sorry! Takeshi, help him. Yes. You're going to smell, so go wash off in the ocean. Look at this. Miss... Let me wipe your bike. What happened here? I'm sorry, he made a mess here. I'm sorry. Fukashi... Did you eat all your breakfast? Yes, I did. Here you go. Be careful! You look so cool! Thankyou. You're in luck. I have an apartment that's available. It's right there. It's one street over. The station is right there. Isn't it convenient? You drove here from Tokyo? That must have been a far drive. So, you need a lot to park your car in. How do you like it? Doesn't the open space feel nice? If it weren't for this building you'd be able to see the harbor. How do you like it? I can put in brand new tatami at no charge. Thankyou, can I move in today? Today? I think I can live here as long as I get some basic necessities. Sure... Are you here alone? Oh, I thought you were married. I'm sorry. I'm going to live here by myself. You stink! The smell is all over you. The smell offish guts and blood doesn’t wash off that easily. I don't care. I like the smell offish. I've always known this smell since I was little. I hope it never wears off of you. The cats and crows keep chasing me because I smell like fish. It gave me the creeps so I threw my clothes away. You may have cats and crows chasing you, but you won't have any girls chasing you like that. I heard a beautiful woman came to see you. She's not that pretty. That's what everyone said. They said she's a little older, but quite sexy and too good for you. Who was it? She's nobody. How could she be a nobody? I heard that you looked very intimate! Tell me who she is! I said she's nobody! Thankyou! You... You sure have guts. The old guys at the shop won't let you get away with this. They're all after me you know! They all want to win me over and take over Naokichimaru. They'd just dump you in the ocean if they found out. I won’t forgive you if you ever compare me to that woman. It's not uncommon for guys to fall off a boat while they're out at sea in the middle of the night. Hello, Minao residence. Dear, I didn't know you were at home. Ryoko! Where are you? I thought you’d be at your mistress' house. That's why I called. I told you I broke it off with her. Where are you? I'm at a harbor. A harbor? There's a fishing port across the river, and there's a bridge that I can't cross. A bridge you can't cross? Hello? Yes. There are some issues with the New York transfer and I need to discuss them with you. I am not going and I'm no longer your wife. Let's sit down and discus all of that. Hello? Are you listening? You must be the new tenant. I see... This area is very convenient. There are vegetable carts and fish trucks that stop here to do business. Fish trucks? Yes, a fishmonger from Naokichimaru brings their fresh catch of the day and sells them out of his truck. Naokichimaru? Yes, here he is. I'm lowering the tarp. Is it ok? Today's special is fresh local tuna. It's from Wakayama. It's so expensive. They're all from coastal waters. I hope it's not Wakayama in the Indian Ocean. No, it's definitely from coastal waters! 1,000 yen. How about it? How about a discount on this because the wrapping is damaged? How about 900 yen? Thankyou! Do you have clams today? Yes, I do. I'll bring it out. Hey fishmonger, I want some fatty tuna, but I don’t want it too fatty. I don't have any. Of course we do. What are you saying? Ma'am, it's a little pricey, but I'll give you a discount. Come with me. This is it. You have a lot. I can't eat it all myself. That's right, so why don’t you get something else? Fukashi, take this to the Matsuba's! Yes. You rented that apartment? Yes. Are you serious? I am. What are you doing? Are you harassing me? Why? I just want to live near you. I'm still going to treat you like a stranger! Excuse me. Would you like to half this with me? I don’t want to waste it. This is fortwo people. No, thankyou. Why? Are you eating fortwo? Then don’t feel bad. Ma'am? Are you going to buy it or not? I am. I'm sorry, I have a guest tonight, so I need 2 servings worth. I'll take this. Who is you guest? You. Ma'am... Over here! - What were you looking at? - Nothing. Were you planning on jumping? What would you have done if I did? Would you have helped me? No, I would have held your head down if you came up and let you die. How scary. You sound like a murderer. A murderer? Ma'am, do you want to go fishing? I've never tried it. I'll teach you. It can be quite fun, once you learn. Are you afraid of a murderer? Afraid? What would I be afraid of? I don't have anything to be afraid of? It's such a long bridge... I'll cook this for you tonight. Don’t you have something more important to do than fishing with me? No. You seem a lot like me. You seem to be avoiding society. Are you avoiding society? But you have a store. I can't close it. If I close it, then that would mean that I've lost to society. But, it's not as if I have any customers. Why? You are at such a good location. Ma'am, you don't know because you just moved here. Don't know what? The rumors. The rumors about Hanai Pharmacy. What rumors? I'll tell you about it later. Don't move. It's too dangerous. Go after it! Go after that boat! That's impossible. They have a bigger engine. It'll be ready soon. Please go ahead and start. You have such a big house. Do you really live here all alone? Yes, I'm alone. Of course, I lived here with my family until two years ago. Me, my wife and her mother. I was adopted into this family. They liked me because I'm a pharmacist, so I married into the family. I'll mix your drink. So what happened to your wife and her mother? They died. Both of them? Yes. Why? Consecutively? My wife was always sickly. She had a weak heart. When I woke up one morning, she was already cold. She died of a heart attack. A month after that, her mother suddenly died. A heart attack? A cerebral hemorrhage. You must be lying. They couldn't have died consecutively like that. I'll have some, thankyou. It's delicious. It went so well, that people started rumors. What? They said that the wife and mother of Hanai Pharmacy were poisoned. They said the husband. is a pharmacist so it couldn't have been too difficult to do. The police dug up their remains and sent it to their forensics lab. They were sure the toxicology would come back positive, but it came back negative. I didn't kill them. But, that scared the customers away and so I have no business. Is that the rumor you were talking about? Doesn't it scare you? There may be poison in this food. You're so strange. Maybe you're just acting like you're a bad person. I actually am a bad person. I wonder what it's like having society treat you like a criminal. Welcome! Hello! How are things going today? You seem like you're in a good mood. I saw you went fishing. You don't need us anymore. This is a nice fatty tuna. I'll take this. That's fortwo people. I know that. Are you going to eat it with him? Maybe... but it's different from when you and I eat together? How so? You should know. You keep running away, but you seem so jealous. Jealous? Give me some clams. I said I'll take this. One portion is for you. I'm never eating that! I have a phone now. This is my number. Call me tonight. I'll be waiting. Thankyou for waiting. Fatty tuna... May I have another sake? Another warm sake for the couple over here. Can I have a white meat fish? I'm an adult now. You're a full-fledged adult. Mom... You're beautiful. Where? I'll tell you later. One more time. Why not? Dad won't be coming home anyway. It's not that. It's so delicious... I put too much wasabi... Mom... Mom... What are you looking at? The Hibiscus... It seems as if it's watching us. Why? It's beautiful. What's wrong? Are you regretting this? Regret? That wouldn’t even cover everything I feel. I had such a hard labor when I gave birth to you. You were so stubborn. Then what? Did I cry out loud? Yes, with a very loud voice. I fainted when I heard your voice. I was in a bed near a window when I awoke. I saw a beautiful Hibiscus tree outside of that window. The flower has bloomed again. I'm so scared... I'm so afraid... Fu-chan... Do you work on Naokichimaru? Yes. Aren’t you going to dance? I can't dance. Look at that girl. I'm going home. Really? That'll be 1,000 yen. Thankyou. Oh no you don't. You promised you'd stay! I'm sorry, I'm tired. I woke up early today. I'm really tired. All right. Let's go then. You're so strange. I'm sorry. You were able to do it before. We did it somehow... It's because I'm tired. You sound like an old man. You don't like me? No, I like you... But... But, what? I can't do it. Why? I don't know. Where did you go wrong? That's what I like about you though. But, you can do it with her, right? That woman that's been chasing you. That beautiful woman... What were you looking at? I noticed that you can see the bridge from here. You're right. Someone might see you. That's ok. I'll just show them. Do you know that a bridge is the end of a road? ''Hashi'' also means the edge, which means the end of something. They say there's a bridge at the end of the road and when you cross that bridge it's pure darkness on the other side of it. They say that's how far and wide the space between a bridge is. Someone might see you. I'll show them. I love you. Ma'am... Good night. Good night! Ma'am, we can't have you doing that. Now we know why we suddenly have more stray cats here. Sashimi? How generous... I'm sorry, I couldn't eat it all by myself. You're alone? I'm sorry, I thought you were married. Excuse us. Ma'am... Your change! Thankyou. NAOKICHIMARU. What are you doing? What are you trying to do? What do you think you’re doing? Get out of our way! Move! Ouch! Get out! Open up! Open up I said! Shut up! What? I need to talk to him, so can you be a good boy and be quiet for a moment? I'm not letting you get away. I was planning to live quietly and not interfere with your life but your avoiding me will only make me want you more. Why didn't you call me? I know you have coins! I stayed up all night! All right! I'm sorry. I'm a little drunk, so here you go. She's so cool. She's so cool... Fukashi, introduce me to her! Who is that? I'm sorry about that. Thankyou for calling. It's such a comfortable place. I think I might live here permanently. Can I live here? My co-worker likes you. He wants to go out with you. What did you say? I said go ahead. I see... There must be another woman... Me? Why else would you be so cold to me? I bet you really do have a girlfriend. I see... I knew it. You did it. Now you can get away from that crazy, old lady. That's what you’re thinking, right? What right do you have to tell me that? You're the one who ran away first! You're the one who betrayed me! Mom... Fu-chan... Mom... Fu-chan... Mom... Fu-chan... Hey! Get my dark suit. The President passed away. I can't go on my business trip. Hey, Ryoko. Is she sleeping? I can't believe she got drunk at a time like this. You... What? Why can’t you knock before you come in? Then you told me we need to stop. I snapped out of it the moment he saw us and it no longer was bur little secret. It was just a moment of sanity, though. You got scared. You were afraid. I guess I can't blame you since you were doing something so unforgivable. I was thinking about your future. I would have ruined your life if we let it continue. Then why did you come after me? I begged you to live with me even if it meant living in the mountains! Do you remember what you said? I will no longer be a woman in another 10 or 20 years. My face and body will be unattractive. But I'll keep living for another 20 or30 years. Would you be able to live with that? Would you be able to continue loving me? I don’t want to do it if you can't continue to love me. That's how you pushed me away! I went crazy and ran away from home! Then you came after me! I'm sorry. Do you hate me? I... ..have a girlfriend. I'm thinking of settling down here. Please don't interfere. What's wrong? It's been a year... Thankyou for today. Are you going home? I can't cross this bridge. I promised myself that I wouldn't cross this bridge. If I cross it, I think I would lose control of my brakes. Kiss me... Fu-chan... What are you doing? Who are you? You're the one that's been chasing Fukashi, right? Why don’t you act your age? No, she's not the one... Then who is she? I'm sorry. I apologize for my behavior. You seem like a normal person. I thought you were a hostess from a bar, you seem like a regular person. Why would someone like you chase after a fishmonger? You better give up. Let's go. Old lady, you should find someone your own age. - Be careful. - What? I told Tetsuya that I slept with you. He won't let you get by that easily. He was looking for you. What do you want to do? Why are you asking me? Stupid, you need to either run or apologize because he's going crazy. My dad promised him he'd marry me and take over the business. Why did you tell him? About us. Because I like you more than Tetsuya. You're late... Who was it today? I met with the older one then Yoko gave me a lift. I knew it. You're sure popular... going from one woman to another. Tetsuya wants to talk to you. Come with me. Welcome. Sit down. How many times did you sleep with her? Once. Once? That's all? Yes. Why only once? I'm asking you if she fell head over heels for you after just one time? I don't know... Yoko is supposed to marry Tetsuya. Didn’t you know that? I didn't know. I'm sorry. You didn't know? That's no excuse! I'm sorry. He has a reputation to keep up. A reputation that he has to keep when he marries Yoko and take over Naokichimaru. We can’t just ignore this. Do you understand? It's raining. I think you should forget about it. You have to take care of your bodies. Tetsuya... Is your mother alive? She's dead. I have a mother. Everyone has a mother. My mother is beautiful. I like her. Are you trying to give us a sob story? I was a bad son. I tried to get into college twice and failed. Then I started drinking and would getviolent. My father got a girlfriend and wouldn't come home. Your home is a mess! I pushed my mother into a corner. I was to blame. What are you trying to say? Nothing... I want you to disappear. They'll just laugh at me for picking on some kid. Get out of this town and go home to your mommy. I'll let you slide with that. Ordo you want me to stab you? I'm not going home to her! I can't go home to her! What do you mean? I don't understand what you’re saying! Tomio... Yes. I'm going to stab you. Fukashi! I don’t want to die. I don’t want to die! Tomio! Don't let him get away! Tetsuya! I did it! Hello? Fukashi. Mom... Fu-chan? What happened? Where are you? Tell me! Fukashi! Fu-chan! What happened? Mom! Are you all right? There's so much blood. What happened to you? Mr. Hanai! Please help me! I'm closed. Mr. Hanai, it's me! Please help me. That boy is in trouble. Boy? All of the hospitals are closed. Please help us. What happened? What did they use? A knife? A kitchen knife. A kitchen knife? Ma'am, we need to call an ambulance. I don’t want an ambulance! Do you want to die? I don’t want to make this into a big deal! I was at fault! I stopped the bleeding for now. So... There doesn't seem to be any damage to his peritoneum, so he should be all right. But, he can't move fora while. Thankyou very much! I'll leave the IV up to you. I don't think he needs blood. Thankyou, Dr. Nishikata. I really didn’t want to have anything to do with you anymore. It's for the best. For both of us. You're putting me in a spot. I know, but I didn't have anyone else. I could call. This is the last time. I hope I'm not going to be dragged in to some mess. Don’t worry, he's not part of a gang or anything. Please take care. Thankyou for coming out at this hour. Thankyou very much. Thankyou. I'm surprised. I didn't realize you had such big son. I had him when I was twenty. So you came chasing after him from Tokyo. Yes. Thankyou so much. You seemed so desperate. I guess he's dear to you no matter how old he gets, right? Yes, he's very dear to me. I'll bring your bedding. You have to look after him. You should stay here fora while. Good morning. This looks like a fun breakfast. It's been a while... Please go ahead and start. No, I'll wait. You have to eat. You don't have a fever anymore, so you need to regain your strength. Is it good? Yes, it's good. It's been a while since I had your cooking. You... ...kissed me last night. I thought you were sleeping. I had a dream. Was it only a kiss in the dream? Leave me alone. Fu-chan. Are you ok? Thankyou very much! Welcome! What's good today? Are you Minao Ryoko? Yes. I've looked for you everywhere. Where is your son? The man who stabbed your son turned himself in. Yasuhara Tomio... He's an employee of Naokichimaru. Do you know him? No. Where is Fukashi? Yasuhara said he did it. I stabbed myself. Yourself? I fell down while I was carrying a kitchen knife. Who was the doctor that took care of you? He was... It was Dr. Nishikata from Kishi-machi. Dr. Nishikata... Wasn't it Dr. Nishikata who helped you two years ago, when your wife and mother in-law passed away. I don't know of any other doctors. I panicked when I saw him bleeding like that. He didn’t want me to call an ambulance. Why is that? It wasn’t that serious. He's quite a kid. Time sure flies. It's been two years. Thankyou for all of your help back then. You had such a hard time with all of those rumors. It wouldn’t have been bad if it were just the rumors, but you people treated me like a criminal. That case isn't closed yet. I'll be back. Thankyou very much. Thankyou. Please take care. He's the one. The one who dug up their bones and sent. it to the forensic lab. Do you want to go out on the boat? There's so much despair on land. This feels so good. You look like you're having so much fun. You look like you've come back to life. Maybe your son coming back to you has something to do with it. Yes. He was so weak when he was little and he would get sick so often. I think it brought back memories of when I used to take care of him. It makes me so happy. Even if he gets hurt like that? That's a little creepy motherly love. Your wife was so beautiful. I saw her picture and she was nothing like I had imagined. You loved her very much, right? My wife died at a hotel. She was with another man at a hotel and she died of a heart attack. The other man was Dr. Nishikata. They had been together long before I married into that family. Was that part of the rumor? No, that's a secret between me and him. Everyone thinks that I was the one in bed with her. That's why he owes me. Why are you telling me that? Isn't it a secret? Probably because you are coming on to me. It would have been better if we never met. Shall we go home? It's getting cold? Is it sore? A little. Looks like it didn't get infected. He's doing fine. I'm so glad. Thankyou. The medicine here works really well. You look like you are getting along well. What do you mean? You and dad used to sit and watch me when I got sick back when I was little. This made me remember those days. Silly. You're such a big baby. It's so strange. I feel so at ease when you're here with me. That's good. It's so lonely being all alone, isn't it? Yes, it is. Thankyou. You should remarry. Would that help my loneliness? I think it's the opposite. That would only amplify those feelings. Don’t you think so? You may be right. What was your husband like? I can't believe he would leave you. He didn't leave me. There's a reason. It's a secret. Do you want to know? No thankyou. Women's secrets are too complicated. I can see something interesting. It's so cute... I wonder what’s so cute. It's so cute. That's such a strange advertisement. It almost seems as though it's revealing someone's feelings. Oh, it went out... Aren’t you going to run away? I don't think I'll be able to do this. It can't be anyone else but him. Who are you talking about? Who does it have to be? Oh, well... Ma'am... Yes? What is it? This won't take long. You should get out of that house. You don’t want to get involved in something strange. Strange? Do you still suspect Mr. Hanai? I thought he was innocent? Not entirely! His mother-in-law's toxicology report came back positive. Dr. Nishikata admitted to it. He's the one who wrote both of their death certificates. Now he’s acting like surgeon when he's actually an internist. I'm sure Hanai is threatening him. Don’t you think it's strange? I don't understand. Dr. Nishikata is saying that there was drugs in the system of a person who died of a heart attack. Does that mean? You're lying. Ma'am, you should go back to your husband. This is a warning. He won't let me shave his moustache. Maybe he's self conscious because you're so pretty. I think I'll have some too. I ran into the detective. The one from the other day. Oh, Detective Katagai. He's so persistent. I'll make you a drink. I should've taught you how to row a boat. That way you can go out on it any time life on the land becomes unbearable. Yes, but why did you suddenly bring that up? It just came to me. It's not too late. You can teach me tomorrow. Tomorrow...? Is tomorrow not a good day? Do you have plans? I don't have any plans, but... ...do you think it'll be sunny tomorrow? Of course. You think so? Too bad, it's raining. I'm going on a trip fora while. Please watch my house while. I'm away. Please close the store. Take care of Fukashi. Hanai. A trip... Why don’t you just say that you’re running away? Mom! Yes. I'm much better. You're so strong! - You shouldn't stand for too long. - I'm fine. You sure are a big baby. This house is even creepier when it rains. I want to go back to my own apartment. Don't leave me here all alone. He's a little strange. What's wrong? It really is creepier here when it starts to rain. It's creepy. Cut it out. Are you planning to sleep with me after sleeping with Hanai? What did you just say? Didn’t you sleep with him? Aren’t you in shock because he ran out on you? Don't play with me to get over that! What did you just say? I'll tell you as many times as you want! Go ahead! I won’t forgive you. I'll kill you if you say that again. I'll kill you then kill myself and show you how much I've been yearning for you. Go ahead and say it again. You have a customer. That's impossible. The store is closed. Yes. Who is it? It's me! It's Yoko from Naokichimaru! I'm sorry for being so rude to you the last time. I didn't know and I wouldn't have imagined that such a beautiful woman would be his mother. I saw how you were together and I was in shock. I'm sorry. What do you want? Please let me see him. I heard he was stabbed because of you. Yes. I'm sorry. So, I wanted to apologize to him. Thankyou but, he's in no condition to see anyone. But the detective said he talked to him. May I at least see his face? I'm sorry, but you’re not the same as a detective. He really isn’t well. Please come another time. Please tell him I came by. Fu-chan! Don't die! No, no! Did you panic? I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding, I said... It's because you threatened me with a knife. So I wanted to scare you. You scared me. I did? I did it! Why did I think you really died? Maybe I was afraid that that may happen one day. That was scary... Be quiet! Hello? Is this Hanai Pharmacy? Yes. - Fukashi? - Yes. Do you know who this is? It's Yoko. Hello. I'm home! I splurged and bought a steak. You don't have to eat rice gruel anymore. Fu-chan! Fukashi. Fu-chan, are you in the toilet? I'm glad you're better than I thought you were. Your mother made it seem like you were really bad. I was worried. You met my mother? Yes, I went to Hanai Pharmacy. Didn't she tell you? It's so good to be home. I'm glad. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Don't apologize. I'm at fault too. It's not your fault. I was careless. Can you come back and work at Naokichimaru? I don't think that's possible. What are you going to do? Are you going home to Tokyo with your mom? No. But didn't she come here to take you back? She's chasing after me. Chasing you? You're making her sound like your lover. Ouch! I'm sorry. Are you ok? I'm here for you. Does it hurt? Go, go... kill him! It's so cute... Fukashi? I'm sorry to bother you. Yes? I see Fukashi left. I heard Yoko came to pick him up and they left together. You just know everything. Yes, my partner was staking this house out. Staking out? We thought Hanai might return so we were waiting for him. It sounds like you're convinced he's a murderer. Now that we have Dr. Nishikata's statement, we have to do what we can do. May I? A warrant? Why are we being so formal? We might be able to take your side. May I have a cup of tea? I see... So Fukashi went home to his own apartment. Right? Ma'am, where is Hanai? I don't know. Didn’t you help him run away? Me? Why? Why would I do that for someone who I don't know well? That's the mysteries of a relationship... That's so ridiculous. Why are you so intent on getting Mr. Hanai? Don’t you have any other cases to work on? He's an outsider. Ma'am, this is a very tight knit community. We don't like the simple fact that the original residents passed away and an outsider like Hanai took over their business. The two deaths were questionable so naturally Hanai would look suspicious in all of our eyes. We can't ignore our resident's opinions. How disgusting... I wonder what Fukashi likes about this town. It's so cute... Detective. What is that an advertisement for? It's an advertisement for Kawai Shoes. A shoe store? It's right behind here. It's quite a big store. The last letter is burnt out. Kawai Kutsu -shoes. I get it now. What's the matter? Detective. Where is Fukashi? I heard you got stabbed. Yes. I heard you didn't go to the hospital or police. People are talking quite highly of you. That's enough. Drink some water. How is your injury? Are you better? Are you going back to Naokichimaru? No. What are you going to do? I don't know. There aren't any other jobs here. That's not for you to worry about. I'm not worried. I'm just bored. Are you ok? You look drunk. I didn't drink that much. I'm going home. I'll take you home. That's ok. Good night. Fukashi. Can I come over later? No, please don't. I'm sorry. I crossed the bridge. It's your fault for running away. I'll chase you if you run. Let's go. Where? I don't know, but out of this town. Why? I can't leave you where someone is trying to steal you from me. Don't come near me. Let's go. Don't come near me. Ouch. Fukashi! Ouch. Fu-chan, are you ok? Does it hurt? Don't touch me! Fu-chan. Don't touch me! Fu-chan, are you all right? Don't come near me! Fu-chan! You fool! I wish I was never born as your child! I'm stupid like you! I wish I was at least smart like Dad! All right! I guess l have to clean up my own mess! I don’t want to give you to another woman! You're mine! I gave birth to you! Damn you! Kill me. Fu-chan. Fu-chan, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry you couldn't get into Tokyo University because you had to be stupid like me. I'm so sorry. You monster! Mon...ster... I'll see you later. Don't look in there. May I have some fish? I don't have any fatty tuna. You'll rot our fish! Go away! You'll rot oarfish. I don't care what you have. Get out of the way! That's why I warned you to leave. Everyone knows. I hope you're not planning to run now. I need you here. Hanai may come back if you’re still here. Fukashi... Fukashi... Fukashi... Fu-chan. That young kid doesn't live there anymore. Mr. Hanai... What are you doing here? You couldn't get into your house, could you? I brought the key with me. Aren't the detectives watching my house? Look at the Hibiscus... Did you come home? I did, but life on the land is a little cumbersome. Were you thinking of going out on the water? I was thinking of never coming back. Do you want to have a drink? I tried to go near my house earlier today, but there were a lot of people there so I didn't think it was a good idea. It's not what you think. I know... I heard about it. Everyone in town knows... I'm sorry. I've contributed to your bad business. Don’t worry about it. It's all over now. Over? How is your son? My son... He ran away again. I see. So he ran away again. So I guess you're going after him again. I was thinking about what I should do. What are you going to do? The detectives are looking for you. I was thinking about what I should do as well. Whether I should turn myself in or commit suicide. So you did do it. I guess you can say that... ...her mother, anyway. I didn't think she would die, but I did have intent. I replaced her high blood pressure medication with a drug to increase her blood pressure, then she actually died on my first try. I panicked and called Dr. Nishikata and had him write her death certificate. It was a perfect murder until then. Can’t you keep evading the police? Why do you think I did it? I was having an affair with her mother. I loved my wife. But I couldn't stand the life that I had. So you're a murderer who was tired with life. You're a mother who doesn't give up. Thankyou. That felt good. Where shall we go? My husband graduated from Tokyo University and his relatives all graduated from prestigious schools. Most of his cousins went to Tokyo University. I applied to Tokyo University once as a joke. So he felt as if he were a shoe in. He had fairly good grades in high school. Then everything went awry after he failed to get in two years in a row. I see, so it was domestic violence... He fought constantly with my husband and he was obsessed with porno magazines. I was in shock when I saw that in his room. I told him let's commit suicide together since it's my fault you turned out this way. Were you serious? Yes. But he told me no. He cried and said he didn’t want to die. He cried and said I'm too stupid and I can't go on like this. He was clinging on to me so tight. That reminded me of the days when he was a baby and I was breastfeeding him. I asked him if he wanted me. Was it good? Did you enjoy sleeping with your son? Yes, it was. Shall we dance? I can't do what they do... Can you ballroom dance? It was so good when we were young. I've always wanted to be a dancer. Sir, this is what we play during the day for the ballroom dance classes. They'd all beat me up if I played this right now. What is this? You're going to play it. What's going on? Mr. Hanai... The defectives were looking for you. I'll be going. I'll come with you. Aren’t you going to ask me where Fukashi is? Please tell him I said goodbye and that I won't ever come after him. Are you going? Yes. Was it good? I can see why your son would go crazy over you. Come here... Do you want to go with me? Was it good? The best! Where to? Who knows... Aren’t you going home to your husband? My husband is in New York. Aren’t you going there with him? No. That's right. We found Mr. Hanai's body in the water this morning. He was bloated like a balloon and trapped in the rocks. I see... He's such a fool, he should've just kept running. We don't even have any solid evidence. What is it? You're in my way. Where are you going? Mom! Where are you going? Mom! Mom! Are you running away? Mom! Are you running away from me? Mom! Are you going to run away from me? Mom! Fukashi. Good luck. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! IWASHITA Shima SAKAGAMI Shinobu OKADA Yusuke Directed By FURUHATA Yasuo
