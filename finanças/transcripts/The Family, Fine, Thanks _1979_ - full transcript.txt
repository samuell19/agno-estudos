I pay tribute to those who with me made "The great family", "The family and an extra one", and now "The family, fine, thanks". To all them and the ones that have left, my gratitude and my unforgettable memory. Lately I'm feeling really good. Agile, fit. ¿Do you want to start eating your food? No, silly grandpa. Death to the white man! Finish him off! Godfather Buffalo. The federal troops! These guys want to burn me alive! Are you trying to burn the house? ¡Chencho! ¡Chencho! On to Bethlehem, shepherds. On to Bethlehem, kids. For here is the king of the swe... - What's going on? - Chencho's lost. - What? - We bring to our screen an appalled marriage. Parents of a numerous family, a great family. Whose youngest child got lost yesterday night. - We lost him. - Dad. Mom. I see you also smoke your classes. It was Physics. I always choke on it. It will be worse when dad asks your grades at the end of the year. The delivery boys made a mistake. - It's for Mr. Beltrán. - I knew there was a glitch. So if you don't think it's a brag, - I've to take it over his house. - And even if we thought so. - You take it away and that's it. - And the turkey. This turkey is mine and only mine. Thin, but honest. - And if I pick you up? - Why are you so interested? Because I like being with you. You have to meet your duties. And the godfather is the father's substitute. The substitute. When there's no father. But there's one, big and strong. - My first grandson. - Here's your candy bar. - Are you going to give him chocolate? - Yes, ma'am. THE FAMILY, FINE, THANKS - Good morning, family! - Good morning, dad! Kids should always be kids. But they grow up. And one day they leave us alone. My kids were no exception. They grew up and they left home before I notice time had passed. They were no longer kids. And that I had reached the retirement age. HAPPY RETIREMENT Careful. Careful! Be very careful. This is a work of art. Slowly. Silence! The cake! The cake! Godfather, are we going to start with the cake? No, it's for the picture. The picture first. If we wait till the end kids will be crying and women arguing. And we'll be singing "Asturias, dear land of mine". Silence! Silence! Dear Carlos, we've gathered here, around you, to be with you in this crucial moment in one man's life. The moment of retirement. These old guys so boring! What a drag! Look at them. They go on and on and on. I'm not giving you anything. - The picture... - Don't be such a drag. With your love and sacrifice you planted the roots of this tree which today, under its lush branches, gives you loving shelter. - Good, godfather. - Very good! To your cares, as a model father. That's why I, with the rights I've earned being a godfather of your 16 kids... Don't touch that. As I give your this homage, moved and excited, I want to proclaim... - Godfather, thanks. - I haven't finished yet. I still have to mention the cake I've done with my own hands. Godfather, thanks. Thanks for the cake. And for that fantastic idea of reunite us all. If I remember correctly, that had never happened before. It's amazing how difficult it is to get to see you. I know, each one of you has his own life. You, Fede, in Cologne. At least you have no kids. They would speak German and I wouldn't know what to do. And you in Lanzarote. When are you coming to Madrid? That's what you promised when you married her. Yes, I promised. But I've been trying for three years and there's no way. Keep trying. And you, Luzgarda, poor thing, alone in your school at Palencia. And you Carlota. My baby. Married to the Lord. At least you're in Madrid. And you, since you're twins and you took to the faith... You could've been priest or monks. But no, missionaries, the hardest thing. And Chencho. Our Chencho. The only one who's not here today. Mr. Alonso, the phone! Lady, we're all Alonso here. A call from New York. New York! Chencho! Chencho is calling! ¡Chencho! ¡Chencho! Dad! Dad, how are you? How's everybody? You don't know how mad I am. I just can't get out of here. Dad, do I have to tell you? I'm dying to see you, to see all of you. What's all that fuzz? I can't hear you. - What's going on? - It's your godfather. Godfather... Godfather Buffalo! Send him a kiss! And all your brothers send you a big hug. Me too. And you, dad. Listen, as soon as I can I come to Madrid and we'll have another banquet, all together. Now that you've called... its as if you were her with us. Take care. New York is very big. Yeah, I know you've been there for two years now, but take care. You take care, dad. Don't worry about me, I'm okay. Thanks, son. Bye. Take this cake to the freezer. It's melting. Carlota, here. This way there'll be no one missing. Godfather, stop playing around! The kids are starving! - The kids and us. - First the picture! Where's the camera? It's hanging from your neck you asshole! - But... - Silence! Married couples, all the kids, the missionaries. Lets see the clergyman... And smile. What a day! Lets see. - Show your belly. - That's it. Come on. Have you got a steady pulse? Come here. From here. Look through little hole and when I say go, you push this little button, but when I say go. - Yes. - Give me. Come on, smile. - When I say "go". - Yes, sir. Coming through! When I say "go". Come on, godfather. Look over there. - Look. - Look here! Attention! Smile! Go! - Happy birthday, dad! - Happy birthday, dad! Happy birthday, dad! What day is today? Your birthday, wise guy. 50 years. 48 if you don't mind. Who cares? - What's this? - Open it. - Surprise. - Beautiful. These are beautiful ties! I wanted to give you a hug and this. - I've earned it... - Money. But that's yours. No, dad. It's about time we start helping you. You don't know how happy you make me. This money reminds me that some of my kids don't need me anymore. And they'll leave. And we'll be alone. And we'll be again like when we started. You and me. But when they come to see us, they'll tell us their stories. And we'll be happy again, because even if they leave... I'm coming! I'm coming! I'm coming! Tobacco. That dope is going to kill himself. That dope is going to kill himself. What dope? The godfather? Yes. Maybe he'll listen to you. The picture. Maybe we can convince him with the picture. Where is it? In the bedroom. But what happened? He's a dope! I told you! I've known that all my life. What happened? Please, put the handkerchief away. I think the siren is enough. Sorry. I'm so used to it. - I've got 16 kids. - Sure. Always with the handkerchief... - I understand. - Sorry. It's my life and I'll do with it as I please! I want to disappear from this world! Get out! Everybody! To hell with everything! To hell with life! I'm miserable! I'm leaving this world because I'm miserable! Hurry! Look at that! Quick, or he'll jump butt naked! Think twice, my son. Don't let despair - cloud your judgment. - Careful, Father! - Come on! - Not your underwear! - Listen! - Life is beautiful. Beautiful? It shows women can't cheat on you. Get that blanket out of there! You'll be damned for all time. I want to confess. "Holy mother of God." Here, through this stairs. Get the firemen and the police out of here or I'll jump! I'm coming. Godfather! Godfather! - Godfather! - Carlos... Please, don't do anything stupid. - Yes. - Godfather, think of them. For your godsons. Don't do anything crazy. I'm so miserable. Where's that? Here, godfather. There. Sure. Get her out of here. I don't want to see her ever again! We're done! Adulteress! Asshole. See, Carlos? Leave it. Let him jump! He's baffled. Paula says you're obsessed. Obsessed? Me? Obsessed? They were in bed, in my bed! - Whore! - Sweet Jesus! Forget the bed and that nonsense. You can't do this to us. Courage, godfather! They're about to approve divorce. - Never! - It's just to cheer him up. - I'm jumping. - Look. Give them a kiss. - Chencho. - For them. - I've got him! - No! Godfather! Easy now! Let me go! I want to die! The presumed suicide, captain. God, what a family. Yes. There's 16 sons. I'm the father and he's the godfather. Waiter, right? Let's see, my good man. You were going to jump to the street, and I'm warning you, suicide is crime. No, captain. It was a nervous breakdown. A seizure, a fit. Marriage problems. You know. - He's very sensitive. - You should be ashamed. Such a decent man and with such a nice wife. Don't be so childish. Everyone knows marriage works thanks to those little arguments. Right? Well... No. In my case, while my wife was alive... Let the other witness in. You riffraff! Your gun! Lend me your gun! - No. - Godfather, are you nuts? Stop it! Who is he? - That riffraff has seduced her! - Calm down! - Adulteress! - I said calm down! And I've got some peppers... so delicious you won't believe it. Look. Look that. Come on, let's eat and forget about it. You did what you had to do. - I haven't done anything. - Precisely. Maybe all this is for not having kids. - I mean, for not doing anything. - What? Kids bring you together. A woman without kids feels frustrated. - She gets bored. - Great. And since she's bored, instead of going to the movies, she gets in bed with the dentist. You didn't tell me he was her dentist. My dentist. I've got shark's teeth. I regret the day I took her there. I'm a dumb ass! Come on. That's enough. Calm down. Do you want to talk about it? I'm calmed. Now, what happened? Nothing. I decided to get rid of the damned wisdom tooth and since I was afraid to go alone, I asked her to come with me and that shameless... This mayonnaise is sour. It's no sour. You're the sour one. - That shameless what? - He drove her crazy. He left me lying there with the needle stuck on, he sat her down and he said she had the most beautiful teeth he'd ever seen. And he wanted her for some ads on TV. Hi, dad. Godfather is here. Hi, dad. Good night. You're in pretty late, uh? - The strike. - Who's on strike? Us. I'm beat. I'm not going to have dinner. I'll shower and I'll go to bed. A glass of milk and straight to sleep. Hey, where's Paula? Well, nothing. It's just that she had a little argument with the godfather and he's staying here for the night. - He's come to tell me all his woes. - Don't try to hide it. María, I'm leaving Paula. Definitely. I'll live here with you. And that's it. Hand me some peppers. - There they are. - Yeah. Watch out. Don't get burned. I told you so. Why are you leaving her? Character incompatibility. I just can't stand her. Come on! All men are horrible. There's the men thing again. I'm fed up with that. - That's feminism. - Feminism my ass! - You bore! - Feminism. Well, godfather, obviously I'm delighted to have you here, but then Paula is keeping the house? The house, Benicasim's lot, the bakery, the car... Everything is registered to her. Tell me, shouldn't I kill myself? I don't know why you stopped me. Who told you to get involved? Wait a minute, don't give me that crap. I would sue her for adultery, but I've got no proof. I should have taken a picture. Hey, wait a minute. Where are you going? - That couch is too stiff. - I can't believe this. It's no my problem. - There's plenty of room. - Plenty of room my ass. I'm used to sleeping alone. Don't be selfish. I'm in bad shape here. Don't you have any consideration? Listen to me. If Paula keeps the bakery, how are you going to make a living? She said she'll give me some money each month. She has no mercy, Carlos. And why did you register everything to her, considering you had a prenuptial agreement? When I had the operation, she said it was best in case... ...in case you didn't make it. In case I got stuck in the operating room. - Dad. - The taxes... You look like a married couple. She's laughing. Women are terrible. I'm not laughing. I was just thinking that if the godfather stays here, he'll keep you company. For now, he keeps me so much company he's already in my bed. Great, because with my job I don't spend much time with you. Honey, if you had finished your studies... It would be the same. The thing is that the godfather is staying and since for a long time I've wanted to have an apartment... - A what? - An apartment! With a friend! Some independence! Shoot, dad, I'm 20 now - and living here is a drag. - A drag? - What do you mean "a drag"? - You've got to understand. I stayed with you so you wouldn't be alone, but now, with the godfather... Are you listening? I was right. Feminism my ass! Forget the apartment. You're staying here at home. At home? I'm never here. I can go to Rome, Paris or Copenhagen, and you don't mind. But if I'm in Madrid I have to stay at home? Come on, dad, don't be ridiculous. María, honey, have you ever missed something with me? Yes, dad. Freedom. - Freedom? - Freedom? Don't you meet here with all your friends? You've got me on a short leash. - You even kick them out. - On a short leash? What do you mean I kick them out if I'm trying to please them. Come on, dad. Don't be so old fashioned. I'll come to visit you. And the godfather too. - You'll come and visit me too? - I'm not going to vanish. Besides, haven't all my brothers left home? ¿And when are you leaving? Tomorrow I can't, I have two flights. In two days. It's a bargain, dad. A friend of mine lends me half of her apartment. Her roommate just got married. See, dad? Even girls who live on their own get married. - Sweet dreams. - Likewise, darling. And your, godfather... - What? ...don't feel sorry for yourself. A free man is worth a fortune. - I hadn't thought of that. - Thanks, daddy. Sweet dreams. Bye. She's young. You can't help it. Such is life. - Daddy, poo-poo. - Oh, my God! Yes, pumpkin, poo-poo. In the duck, daddy. Yes, in the ducky. - Daddy, tell me a story. - Go to bed. - Daddy, I love you very much. - Me too. How can we jogging at this age? - You have to be fit. - I shouldn't listen to you. - You always have to be fit. - What for? A free man is worth a fortune. Leaving Paula messed you around. Don't talk. Breath. Feel the fresh air. Look at Madrid. Here, everything is healthy. I can't even breathe. That's just lack of training. Next year we'll run the marathon. No way! You run it. Practicing sports may be very healthy but it just kills me. Hey, don't stop. Your muscles will get cold. - Keep going. - I was thinking about something. Stand still! It's very serious. Lack of energy. What were you thinking about? I can't go on like this. This is very healthy. Look. Isn't it a bitch that a man like me, with 16 kids, 12 of them married, has to live alone like a dog? Hey, thanks a lot. And me? Nothing. It's not you. A daughter is not the same. In the end, lberia returned her to me once in a while, but now... You know you're right? Antonio is a solution. A big house, swimming pool, tennis courts... Every comfort. That's what I thought, but won't the others feel bad? Why? Since Antonio is the oldest one and the one with a better social status, maybe the others will think I'm staying with him out of selfishness. Isn't he the oldest one? - Yes. But even so... - Don't worry. That's settled. If they get upset, you tell them... you're just taking turns. One month with each one. Or two. That's it! That way I could see my grandsons! All of them. Because I never get to see the little one. Obviously. You start taking turns, but with Antonio. By order of appearance. - That way no one gets upset. - That's it. - That's it. - Exactly. Come on, one last sprint. Cheer up. Come on. Hey, if I stay at Antonio's, where will you live? - With you. - With me? Am I not godfather of all of them? I know. I'm just saying this because to have two people - suddenly move into your house. - So I'm just people. This is incredible. So you have everything solved and I'm back in the streets. It's not that. You don't want to be a nuisance. Sure, I'm a nuisance. You're so selfish! No wonder your poor wife said so. - When did she say that? - She thought so. - I don't want to talk about it. - Listen to me, thickhead. We talk to Antonio and if he doesn't mind, we're in. I'll sell my flat and we'll start living. But together, like before. Matias, we can leave now. That's it. You've made a good deal, Mr. Carlos. - Well, if you pay me... - Sorry, I forgot. I have the check signed. Here it is. Good bye, Mr. Carlos. - Thanks, Matías. See you. - Bye. How many times did we changed the furniture? We bought another ones always just meeting ends, always on credit. And one day... Come on, don't get sentimental. There's no taxis here. Look at me. No house, no bakery, no kids. Nothing. There comes one. Taxi! Taxi! Taxi. - To the airport, right? - No, to Somosaguas. - Come on. - And the picture? - Have you got them? - What pictures? - You haven't got them? - No. Then they're in the truck. Come on. Hurry up. Follow that truck. Come on, get in. - It's a blue truck. - Blue. There it goes. I think it turned to the right. Listen, - wasn't that my grandson? - I don't know. I couldn't see him. They drive like crazy. - Our baggage. - There's one missing. Here. How much is it? - 980, sir. - 980? - Here, keep the change. - Thanks, sir. You're welcome. Pick up your suitcase. The maid can do that. Pick up your suitcase. It's too heavy. 1.000 pesetas. Almost as much as I got for the furniture. Use your head. - Good night, Mr. Carlos. - Good night. Where is my grandson going so late? No idea. To smoke joints. I'll tell the Lady you're here. Yes. - Did she say joints? - Smoke joints. Dope. Ajoint. I think they've set up a party for us. Antonio didn't said anything. This is what I call a house. We'll live as kings here. We thought you weren't coming tonight. - Hi. - It's been awful, Melita. - Come in. - He. He doesn't remember a thing. He's doddering. They took the pictures with the rest of the furniture and we had to find the owner of the warehouse. - You look stunning. Let me see. - You're always so nice. - Where's Antonio? - We've got guests. He's coming now. What a complication. No, no! Over here! Over here! We've got a couple staying at the guest room. Important people. You understand, don't you? - Yes, sure. - They always stay at the Ritz, but this time they didn't make any reservations and for tonight you'll have to stay here. - Manolo, please. - Yes, ma'am. Through the other door. You don't mind, don't you? - No. - Juanito and Loli... can sleep in the cook's room. - Have you had dinner already? - With this picture business... You can have dinner right here. The dinning room is completely full. You'll have to forgive me, but is a very important dinner. Antonio's business. Juanita, when these gentlemen have finished dinner, - show them to your room. - Yes. - Are the snacks ready? - Yes. And the pastries. Come on, everything. - Do you want caviar? - Yes. More snacks, Pepa, these people are starving. - Here, darling. - Give me. Isn't there any Spanish omelette? They just took it away. Here, I've got a fritter. Pastries, godfather. Where are the pastries? Thank you, sir. Hurry up. These guys are devouring everything. More wine. Come on. Thank you, sir. Greed, Carlos. Greed. He didn't settle being an architect. Real state companies, suburban developments... Well, the works. - Nice welcome. Hi, dad. - Hi, son. - Godfather Buffalo. - Antonio, how are you? 14 hours at the studio and I still have to work at home. - Melita told you, right? - Yes, she told us. - Have you had dinner yet? - He ate something in the kitchen. Everything is great, son. Come on, tomorrow will be different. If you want to join us for a drink, but they're very boring. - Yes, that's fine with me. - Hi, dad. Hi, grandpa. - Mom told me you were here. - You just got in? Poor thing. Look where they've stashed you. Then your brother goes out to smoke some joints at 1:00 and you get in at midnight? It's the traffic, grandpa. - Well, see you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. Hey, these kids have lots of freedom. - When you were their age... - Times change. - Well... - How I envy you. You get to go to bed and I have to stand that drag. You've got no car, right? Take the small one. Don't worry. Thank you, Antonio. See you tomorrow, and get a good rest. Great kid, uh? He's lending us his car. But one thing, you'll drive, because I don't want to know anything about towing trucks, parking spaces or all that stuff. Great kid. If we didn't have so many appointments... Why didn't we go over to Mercedes' place? With her mother in law there? That's true. It's okay, sir. I'll bring it in. Oco! Come here, boy. Come on. Poor thing. Come on, Oco. Here, you give it to her. Melita likes these things. - No, you give it to her. - No, you give it to her. - ¡Oco! - Gestures. What cigars. It's like going to the grape harvest. What are you doing? Are you nuts? Come on, godfather. They smell much better. They're waiting for us. Why don't you give it to her? - Don't be such a drag. - You're her father in law. Quick or we'll be late. You're an Aguirre. Mr. Carlos, you can go into the dinning room now. Thanks, Juanita. Good morning, fami! But... My son? Mr. Alonso never has lunch at home. And Mrs. Alonso is at the hairdressers. - And my grandsons? - It depends. Sometimes. Can I serve the food? Yes, sure. - Here, put these in water. - Yes, sir. You're no good. That's what you are. A useless guy that never has done anything right. Without me you'd be starving to death. - You're the only stupid. - I'm fed up with you. You're an incompetent and a... What do you want, dad? Why do you talk like that to him? How do you want me to talk to this asshole? Antonio! Let's not dramatize and let's not waste time. This guy always will be a disaster. He's my brother and I don't want to argue with him. Here's what we'll do, Carlos, I'll keep giving you your salary but don't come to work, okay? You can shove your salary up your ass! Well said. I can't believe you, Antonio. Godfather, I'm a grown man. You don't want my money? How will you make a living? How are you going to live? Who will hire you? You're here out of pity! What did you want, dad? First apologize to your brother. Me? Come on! Don't talk to me like that. And stand up. You're not going to apologize? Okay. Thanks for your hospitality. And keep your stinking house, because we're leaving. - Dad, please, don't say that. - Hospitality... I came to your house looking for warmth and tenderness. Come on, son. What good is his money if he doesn't have a home? Listen to me, Antonio. If you don't apologize to your brother, don't ever talk to me again. Or to me. Dad, I'm an architect. Architect! I love the sound of that. Your mother said so, "we'll have an architect in the family". Now he have one. Something I couldn't achieve. And he ends up working as a plumber. Rosa, please, don't poke your nose. - I want to be an ecologist. - Ecologist? - You know what is? - How could he know? That's fantastic. You've got to defend nature. Ecology. - Godfather, a bit more. - No, thanks. It's delicious, but I've got to watch my figure. - What for? - He's going to run the marathon? He's an athlete. Can you make money with ecology? He's so materialist. You should learn from the young ones. Mom, I don't want anymore. You have to eat everything. Look at my dish. Like a mirror. - Belén, pick up the dishes. - I laid the table, mom. Then you do it, Rosa. And stop poking your nose! I have a cold! And what's that got to do with it? When your nose itches, which finger do you use? This one. Nacho, bring the fruit. This kid only listen to his father. Godfather, you always bring pastries. Constantly. And why didn't you bring some? Movie! Movie! - Thanks. - Here you are. Well, I see that once the movie starts, we can't talk anymore. We're got to do your beds. - That's true. - Shall we? Lets go. Ecologist, uh? Ecologists don't eat sweets. Stop with ecology. What a fuss are we making... ...because of this brute! - Me? A brute? If you hadn't talked me into selling my house we wouldn't be here causing trouble. No trouble. You'll be just fine her - You think? - Of course. - Do you want some milk? - No, thanks. - ¿Really? - Then have a good night, dad. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. - Okay, bye. See? They're so nice. Why can't Antonio be like that? - He's rich. - So what? Nice rich people go bankrupt. - The problem is we can't stay here. - ¿Why? Because this is too crowded. If you want to move here you must jump the hurdle. Don't worry. The minute we find a job for Carlitos, we're leaving. This bed is one leg short. Stick a couple of books underneath. That's it. - Which bed do you want? - The long one. This is one leg short. Don't jump here. - I'm exhausted. - Good Lord. Always joking. When are you going to grow up? - Godfather, give me five! - What's this? - Hi, dad. - Hi, son. Hi, brother. Cheer up! Up with those shoulders! Strong look! - Let's go to my office. - Kid. So that no good Antonio fired you, uh? - No, I left. - Sit down. - Godfather! - What? - Sit beside me. - No way. Come on! Now that your brother's here, what can we do about him? When do you start? Tonight? - Whenever you say. - Tonight? He's got the night shift. What will your brother be doing? Answer the telephone, control the keys... It's a piece of cake. Well, the truth, Críspulo, is that... Here call me Cris. You sure did a nice prank giving me this name. The saint of the day. It wasn't my fault. - Yes, dad? - That job doesn't fit your brother. Dad, do you think that I could find a job as a biologist I'd be the manager of this? Money is what counts and Carlos can make a lot of dough. How much? The salary is not much. The tips are important. It depends. 250.000 or 300.000 pesetas. I'll stay gladly, if I'm the man for the job. Of course you're. It's a piece of cake. And you two are staying here as long as you want. But, son, this is a hotel. - It seems fine to me. - Of course. But Mercedes has our room ready for us. Forget it. Carlos will call her now. Okay. I'm staying. You've got plenty of gorgeous women. - What's up whit him? - The divorce. - Foreign girls? - And locals, assimilated... The godfather is a playboy. A free man is worth a fortune, my dear. - Cris. - You want to fool around? Lupe, 106 and 107. Kid, get the baggage. Block them till I tell you. - Get the baggage! - Yes, sir. Here, godfather, 107. - The 107 is for you. - Thanks. I'll be up in a minute. - To the first floor. - First floor. Lupe, teach my brother. He'll do the night shift. - Bye. - ¿Okay? - I have no idea... - It's easy. We'll have a hell of a time here. We'll live like kings. Yeah, yeah. This place is full of women. Did you see that? Are you horny or what? It would have been better to sleep together. Much better like this. More independent. You pig! It's about time! I've been waiting for you! Crying! Feeling miserable! Let's see what excuse you make up today. There's been a confusion. - Excuse me... - You cynic! Kiss me, bad boy. - No, no. - What? Your kisses are mine. You're driving me nuts. That's what I love, you're my pimp. - I... - Come here. Juan Quemada. - I've got my ID here. - Oh, your ID Give me this ID, macho man. No, no. My ID. I'm locking you up. You and me here. We'll order lunch, dinner... Who did you show your ID to? Miss, don't. - Give me your mouth! - I'm not made out of stone. Yes! Yes! - My God! You satire! - No, no. She started it. She confused me. Molesting a client? It was just mistake. - A mistake. - It was all a joke? You fool! You'll pay for this. You'll see. Miss, you should know that this asshole's name is not Cris, his name is Críspulo. Críspulo. Come in! Good night. Courtesy of Mr. Cris. - No, get out. - No, don't listen to him. Get out of here! Leave it here, please. - Good night. - Bye, thank you. Don't be touchy. It was just a joke. - He could have done it to you. - I'm his father. And I'm not as horny as you. Because you... complain, but if Críspulo hadn't show up, you would've ended up in bed with her. Of course, I'm a man. And when a man gets going, watch out. It seems the girl was okay, uh? Okay. This one is a monster compared to her. And you didn't notice she was faking it? Faking? She faked it at first but then... Why did Críspulo had to come in? Jokes should be carried all the way. You've earned it. Let's drink a toast for him. No, he's capable of pouring bleach in there. Come on. To Críspulo. - And to me. - To all of them. And to Antonio too. You son of a bitch. You're not leaving! Get inside! I'm calling the police. You pig! Come here or I'll poke your eyes out. No man is going to hustle me, you know? My money! I want my money! - Did you hear that? - Yes, I heard it. Then this is a... Exactly. We're leaving tomorrow. And Carlitos too. - And make him quit his job? - Job? You call this an honest job? I didn't raise my kids to be... - What about Críspulo? - He's the manager. Besides, he's single. The tips. Of course, that's why they give so many tips. Look. Carlitos will do with this. At least for the time being. - The money from the flat. - How will you live? My pension is enough. Besides, I've got them. ¿What's that? Bidets, working non stop. - Does he know you? - Yes, but he doesn't remember. - Then call him. - Handsome. It's me. - Say his name. - I can't remember it. It's better to ring the bell. While I ring the bell get his attention. ¡Dog! Woof! Woof! Dog! Woof! Woof! Ready? That's it. Woof! Woof! Dog! Woof! Woof! Woof! Woof, damn it! Why isn't he on a leash? A police dog on a leash? They will open now. Come on, boy. It's me. - Good boy. - What are you doing here? - Hi. - Hi, godfather. - Hi, honey. - Hi, dad. - The dog. - Didn't you ring the bell? - Yes. - How are you? First you said yes, then you said no. Shut up, Kaiser. This door... Come in. Come, Kaiser. - Calm down. - ¿Kaiser? They're family. Come here. He's harmless. - Kaiser. - Come on. My mother in law is home. - Is she? - Yes. Kaiser, come here. I've cooked a great meal for you. - ¿Really? - Yes. Spanish omelette. - A thick one. - Super thick. And lentils and rice. - Like in the old times. - Good. Go to the yard. Kaiser, stop it. Come on, let me open. See? She was home. It was you? I'm a bit blind. I thought you were two bums. Kaiser barks like that when they ask for charity. They told as they we're coming. I'm a little bit deaf also. Come in. - Come in. - How are you, Consuelo? Godfather, how could you do such a dirty trick to Paula? - Me? - Poor thing. Did you hear? I'm the one to blame? If it weren't for my father, you wouldn't be here. We'll talk later. Take your baggage upstairs. We stay upstairs? Great, Mercedes. - You'll be better there. - Thanks. That's the good thing about this houses. Freedom, independence... Don't you think so? - One thing. - Yes. Since I live upstairs too and we have to share the bathroom, when you use it, open the window. I'm very weird about smells. They've given us the best room. South oriented. Listen to the birds. What do I care about the birds? The broads at the hotel were my thing. That thing about ask for charity was sarcastic? Don't be so twisted. Let's unpack. For the love of God! Turn it down! Okay. - Let's play chiribito. - No, not this one. Kung-fu, then? You can play Kung fu on your own. - Okay. - I won't say anything. Me neither. Let's play the classic. I don't know where the aces are. Honey, she always gets the aces. - Come on! - This whisky tastes awful. - And the gin too. - Put some ice in it. Where's the ice? - Carlos? - What? - Bring some ice. - Right away, Consuelo. 100 pesetas on the jack. Your full is too obvious. - What's obvious is her flush. - Are you in or not? Yes, I'm in. And what do you say about this ace? - Here. - I'm betting 500. It shows you're rich. It's two on my hand and three on the table. Natalia, you've been playing poker since you were a toddler. 1.000 pesetas. 1.000 pesetas? Okay, but whit that... What they have in the hands... - I don't know... This is very unhealthy. Doctors never allow you to do this. We have no choice. They could play in the kitchen. I'm not telling them. Nati, I'm not afraid of your eight. - That's why I'm raising your bet. - Are you? Yes. I bet you all you've got. Are you in or not? I'm in. But turn that card very gently. Full house. Three aces and two eight! No. Three eight and two aces. But it doesn't matter. I've got poker of aces! Wait a minute! Wait a minute! These are marked cards! Marked cards? At my home? Completely marked! Look! One small dot! Two dots. Of course, it's a queen. Let's see an ace. - Stop it or I'll brake your neck - Here's the ace! Three small dots! The ace! Three dots! No wonder she always wins! What a shame, Consuelo! I swear it's a new decked. - It must be a mistake. - What a nerve! Here! Your cards! You cheat! Robbing us each Sunday! Look at this dot! "From the factory", she says! A red dot! Green dots! Blue dots! Don't listen to them! - This broad is a bitch! - How could you do this to us? - I won't come here again! - We should sue her! Are you going to return us our money? Money? What money? You're just a bunch of hoodlums and losers! She's even calling us names! - Let's get out of this house! - Sore losers! Get out! Get out! Whores! It's my fault. I'll hang up a sign! Cheater! Restricted entrance. Get out! Come on! They're such a scum! You never know who you play cards with. My daughter's mother in law cheats at card games. No, not the deck. This is the crime evidence. What a crime! Gambling, lady, is sacred! You're nothing here! You're not family! Give me the deck! - No, not the desk. - I'm not family at all. Just a bum asking for charity. Remember when he got here? She mistook us for bums and said she couldn't see. How come she sees those little dots? Let's make a deal here. We'll show this deck to Alberto and Mercedes unless... - That's blackmail! - Call it what you like, but our mouths are shut. But you'll stop ruining our life in this house. The deck! - No, not the deck. - And you'll clean the ashtrays. And don't leave the loo full of hair. It sucks. - Give me the deck! - And one more thing! Never worry again about my cholesterol. At lunch time I eat whatever I want. - And me too. - Yes. And we'll turn up the volume as much as we want. I'm very healthy and I've got no cholesterol! Don't look at me with miserable face when you say "poor turkey". So let's make an agreement, a deal. The deck! The deck! Ouch! Ouch! - Don't you touch me! Ouch! - Godfather! Don't touch me, you pervert! Stop it! That is for the clerks at the bakery. Satire! You satire! - Carlos, she's got the evidence. - Satire! What's she talking about? - She's got the evidence, Carlos. - Hey, - ¿What? - And what about the bakery? Lies! That infamous swindler is lying! Maybe someday at the counter. It's very narrow and placed my hand by mistake... Dad, no one is throwing you out of this house. - You tell him, Alberto. - But I... Carlos, you know I haven't got anything against you. - Only against the godfather. - I didn't get a feel of that monster. Watch it. She's my mother. Sorry. You're right. I'm leaving. You can stay if you want. I'll see you around. Thanks for all. Don't turn this into a drama. His wife left him. And I'm sorry. You know how much I love him. But he could do go to a hotel. - Or shoot himself. - He's gone too far. He called my mother a cheater. Cheater. So for you if the godfather leaves, it's okay. After all, I'm your father and you have to put up with me. Dad, who says putting up? Me, Mercedes! Me! Dad, please. Listen to me. - Carlos... - Dad, don't be... - Help me out, Alberto, please! - What do you want me to tell him? Juan! Wait for me! Wait up, godfather! - Godfather! - Juan, wait up. Wait! Don't worry, that pervert left. Listen. Being the godfather of my kids, is my best friend and not you, swindler, nor the Holy Spirit himself can insult him in front of me. - Carlos... - Dad, don't get so upset. Don't worry, honey. I'm okay. I'll call you. Where are you going to go so late? - Don't worry about me. - Dad, please. Godfather. See what you've done, mom? - See what you've done? - I didn't do anything. Dad, don't do this to me, please. - I'm not doing it to you. - Come inside. You're completely right. Alberto is dominated by his mother, but - he's my husband and I... - I know. Now get back in your house and don't worry about me. Really. There's no problem. What problem can there be for a father so packed with kids like me? - Will you call me? - Of course I will. And ask your mother in law to forgive us. Tell her it was our fault or our mistake. Really. See you soon, honey. Godfather! Juan! Godfather, wait! They're leaving, right? Grandma, right? In the street. Lying like two mutts. Where are we going to sleep? Sleep? Sleep. You only think about material things. Do you thing I can sleep so nervous? Are you planning on spending the night here? He was going to be the glory of basketball. You should've seen him. Real Madrid wanted him. - You Real Madrid? - No, not me. Juanito. - Godfather, explain it to her. - What? - That Juanito played basketball. - Give me that. You're no good for going out at night. Alo Juanito. Well Juanito... Juanito. - Do you understand? - Yes. Well Juanito played basket. Basketball. You a waiter? - Simone, come here. - Dance, Simone. Dance. You're such a dope for languages. - Hi. - Hi. I want you to meet Juanito's father and his godfather. - This is Bea. - Hi. Having an orgy? - No. It's just... - It was a joke. Juanito is always talking about you. You must be an awesome father. Where is he? There, dancing. Juanito is something else. - You see how much girls like him? - Buy me a drink. He's taken after me, godfather. Because until I met my poor wife, I was a stud. Remember? You spent your youth studying official exams. Okay. But I had them all over me. I mean the women. The thing nowadays is that in our days there were no girls like this. Women are just like cars. Each year you've got better models. I don't know what will they look like in the year 2000. And where do these goddesses hide? Because I don't see them during the day. Maybe they are working. I guess. No, they would age in no time. Maybe they have money. - Have they left you alone? - Don't worry, son. We're having a great time. Right, godfather? - Awesome, Juanito. - It doesn't look like it. Dad, shake your booty or you'll depress my clients. No, thanks. These dances... No. Thanks a lot. It's very nice of you. I'll ask for some slow music: pasodoble, tango, bolero... A funeral march if you want. It's the first time you've come here. It's the first time you've come here for a drink. - But I do. Can I? - Course. There she is. Dance. Come on, girl. We should lock him up. He's a sexual maniac. - Waiter. - Yes, Mr. Juan? - Take these things to my office. - No. I rather them with me. It's like if I had my house with me. ¡ You're crazy! Nel blu dipinto di blu mille violini sonati dal vento e penso che un sogno così no ritorni più giù. Volare, volare, nel blu dipinto di blu. So, do you like my little club? If it is so crowded every day - you must make a lot of money. - I told you we're three partners. - Hi, baby. - Hi, girl. Hey, don't you have a steady girl? Are you nuts? All of them are friends. Yes, but since you're 28, - I thought maybe... - Hi, Raúl. a wife, a home, kids... Dad, something that lasts forever, like marriage, you have to think it over your whole life. Don't you think? You're the most beautiful girl in the world. That's it. ... e un amore profondo mi lega a te. Splende il tuo sorriso sul dolce tuo bel viso. Non ho I'età per amarti. - No puedo más. - I don't understand. - I have to pee. - Oh, pee. I know. I'll get you to the loo. That's because of the Coca-Cola. Nicoletta. - Italia is a beautiful country. - Beautiful. Fontana di Trevi, the coins... Do you know what's your name in Spanish? Nicolasa. What a crime! - I must pee. - Yes, pee. Ours is a romantic love, Nicoletta. - One more kiss. - Bye. E poi per sempre ti perderò. Arrivederci, bambina. - Hey. - Hey. - Where have you been? - She had to pee. What do you give them, besides disgust. My gift of gab. Give me two nights and I'll wreak havoc. This is fantastic. They don't know how to treat them. Nice jackets, nice outfits, but nothing more. She's coming out. See that? This is awesome. Juanito sure knows how to live. At night, party, during the... Look, you can even see Extremadura. Hey, this must be worth a fortune. You know what? We've been stupid. Imagine the life. In Easter, torrijas, in All Saints Day, buñuelos - and in Christmas, baskets. - But I'm thinking, can a discotheque make so much money? Charging 1.500 pesetas for a glass of water... Let's go upstairs, there's another level. Holy mother of God! Wow, what's this? What? - Who's that girl? - She must be another friend. Come on. Let's go. Let's get out of here before she wakes up and screams. This one doesn't scream. This is gruesome. What a way to live. Fabulous. Fabulous my ass! Don't you see? This is not a home, this is an amusement park, if not something worse. ¿Or you find it normal for a grown up man to have his living room full of toys? Toys? And what about that girl? Because Juanito didn't sleep alone tonight. He could be a bit more discreet. He just leaves us here and that's all. After all, I'm his father. You know what? As soon as I shave and get dressed, I'm going to phone Luisita. Luisita? No way. I'm staying here. And tonight I'll hit the disco. I'm meeting Nicoletta. Are you insane, godfather? I know what's wrong with you. You would've like Juanito to finish his Pharmacy studies and only go out at night when he had the night shift. You're so old! And the loo? Where the hell is the loo? You don't even have a sense of orientation. You're lost. A loo. There it is. Wait a minute. I saw it first. Look for another one. There must be plenty of them. - Come on. - Don't look. I'm very shy. My God. - Don't look, I'm embarrassed. - Sorry. - ¿Do you want some juice? - What? Grapefruit juice. - I don't understand. - Here. - Thanks. - I'll do another one. Juanito yesterday drunk too much. Too much alcohol, ¿ understand? - ¿"Bere" is drink? - And today his tongue is hard as a rock. Sure, in Spanish this is hangover. Hangover. Juanito this morning was "stanco", ¿ understand? "Stanco", tired. Yes, but he must go to the bank. ¿He must go to the bank? Yes, it's his... ¿how do you say it? - "Lavoro", work. - Work. Juanito has a lot of work that's why you are preparing coffee, toast, juice. Because Juanito is sleeping now because he's tired. Yes, he's a good man. - ¿ Want some coffee? - Don't bother. - ¿ Sugar? - No, no. Really, don't bother. I think it's better if you take all this to Juanito - so he won't be late of work. - That's true. Bye. See you. - Yes? Come in? - Godfather. Hey, I'm serious. If you want to go with Luisita and his no high strung husband, it's okay, but I'm talking to Juanito this afternoon. And you'll ask him for Nicoletta's hand? Do you know who slept tonight with Nicoletta? With Juanito. Step aside. Close the door. Hey, it was wonderful. I don't get it. We're nobody. At least me. I just don't get it. There she was, in the kitchen, preparing breakfast for Juanito. A wonderful woman. She look like the perfect married woman. It was awesome! So tender and loving, but completely naked. - What? Completely? - Yes. And she looks like very nice girl. I don't know why doesn't marry her. - Well, you say she was naked. - Yes, but... We've run again into the wolf's mouth. - No, she's another one. - She's the same one. Hi We were just passing through her and... Sorry. Godfather, the world is theirs. We are stuck with hot soup, grandchildren... - There's nothing we can do. - No. Look how beautiful this is. - Grandpa, I'm thirsty. - Okay. - And I'm hungry. - And I want to see the pandas. - Okay. - And I want to see the monkeys. - Okay. - This train is going too slow. - And my feet hurt. - They hurt, my love? Didn't you want to ride in this train? - But it doesn't stop. - It does stop. - I want some chips. - Okay. - And I want a Coke. - Okay. - Now we'll have all that. - Grandchildren are little angels. My love. Look. That's it. A little smile. You, stop reading the paper! Girls, stand close to the godfather - grandpa shoots the photo. - I've got the sun in my eyes. Grandpa, are those bears dangerous? Don't worry. Now your godfather jumps in and they eat him up a bit so you can have some fun. - Yes. Yes. - Let's see that smile. Imagine the bears are eating your godfather. Very funny. Let's see that little smile. There it is. DANGEROUS ANIMAL KEEP OUT Monkeys! Monkeys! Wait a minute. Don't you know how to read? "Dangerous animal, keep out." They attack man. I can't believe you. You should watch them. You're their grandpa... - Okay. - What do you mean "okay"? Look how cute they're with the bears. You tell me if that's okay. He's very excited. He's frantic. - He's very nervous. - It's not because of them. It's you. See? You even make the monkeys nervous. This is weird. You don't know him? What do you mean I know him? Do you think I'm Tarzan? No. The little animal has mistaken you as his father. Look. "Dad". He's calling you "dad" in his language. That's awesome. - Let's see what he does. - No. Don't you see? "Dangerous animal, keep out." No, that's only with strangers. He won't do you no harm. That way the girls can have some fun The take them in. Take the girls. - Not them. You. - Look how upset is the poor thing. Frankly, you shouldn't come to places like this. - Why? - Because of your face. What's wrong with my face? What are you doing with that soup bowl? - Don't you see the girls are not here? - Since it's already 22:00... Get back to the kitchen. We'll call you. Your father and the other one are so irresponsible! I'm coming. Let's do the potato circle. We'll eat salad. Duck! And duck again! Because those who duck don't know how to dance. You should be ashamed! At your age! Don't you know what time it is? The kids should be already in bed. - Let's go to bed! - No. - Dad, godfather is awesome! - He had a great time! Come on. Both of you. Get to bed right now. No, dad. I want to stay and play with the godfather. He's high strung. I told you, he's high strung. - Hi honey. Good night. - Hi. What's the matter with him? Why is your husband behaving like that? Don't listen to him. How was your day? Okay. - How did they behave? - Very good. The kids are like two little angels, but he's a bit of a bore. What an irresponsibility! What a shame! - It's disgusting! - What's the matter? Matter? Your father and your godfather have spent the afternoon teaching the girls dirty words. - Us? - You! This nut case, "shit". And you, their grandfather, "fuck". Sorry, Luisa. - Maybe it just slipped. - Well, naturally. I don't think it's such a crime. Maybe the kids innocently repeated that. Shit is not a dirty word. It's an exclamation. And about the nut case part, I'm not a nut case, understood? To begin with, they didn't take them to church. It's the first time they miss church on a Sunday. - You didn't go to church? - Well, you see, it was such a beautiful day, we wanted to make the most out of the daylight. Sure, and to make the most out of the daylight, the best you could think of was to take them to the zoo. - I don't think that bothers you. - It's very instructive. Yes, very instructive. - Very instructive. - Jorge. The world will not come to an end because they missed it. No? Look at this. Do you know what the girls think? They think this nut case is married to an ape and he just got divorced. And besides, look at this. A bear! A bear mating, covering a female. Dad! I... - I didn't notice that. - But they did. And naturally they asked what are the little bears doing. - Jorge, I think you're overreacting. - You stay out of this. What a lack of responsibility! Listen to me. - I think that's enough. - Dad, please. I've raised 16 kids, you know? - Included your wife. - Please, don't argue. Okay, don't argue. Let's have dinner in peace and in the grace of God. No offence, Carlos, but from now on I prefer that... that you don't go scandalizing the girls. Leave them alone. - I shouldn't see them anymore. - It's not that. It is. It is! Or not? Say it openly! From now on I shouldn't be so close to my granddaughters. Let's stop arguing. Maruchi. Maruchi, the soup! Exactly. The soup you can have the both of you, because I... and the godfather, are going to bed, to say our prayers, and tomorrow we'll get up early to confess, and if we have to spend the rest of our lives repenting, we'll do it! But definitely not here, because we're leaving tomorrow. Let's go! God, dad, don't make me upset. - Godfather, talk to him. - Me? What do you want me to say? - Your father is right. - I'm sorry, honey. Believe me, I'm sorry. Good night. How dare you forbid him to see his granddaughters? I didn't forbid him that. But if this goes on... Admit it's not a proper way to behave! Don't try and teach any lessons to my father! You should learn a lot from him! Serve the soup. Hey, I don't know Monica's husband very well, but, - isn't he a dope? - No. Roberto? No way. He's a great guy, healthy, bold... He was underwater fishing champion. Since your sons in law - have turned out so bad... - That's true. Shouldn't you call Sabina? No, no. With all that feminism thing, - she's very boring. - Exactly. Since she's alone, there's no risk of another son in law. That's nothing. A very slight pink eye. - Some allergy I guess. - It could be. I don't know. That's the age, Roberto. - Godfather is pretty worn out. - You're the worn out here. It's all just a front. And what for? You should go to the optics and Roberto give you a pair of sunglasses. Yeah, sure. - Drop by any time. - Thanks. I will. - Cream, dad? - Yes. Thank you, honey. I'm warning you, he'll keep the sunglasses and the whole shop if he can. He's got such a nerve! And underwater fishing, excuse me, is really dangerous? No. It's just a matter of common sense. Are you interested? - Don't encourage him. - Why not? Because next thing I know I'll be wearing flippers. Don't you know that this crazy guy wanted me to run? - Run? Come on! - You bet! And thank God he gave up the idea, because he wanted to run the 42 km marathon. I'm just not a fossil like him. - Then you are having a drink. - Sure. Well, if you feel like it, you can join us for this vacations. - Where are you going? - To the Red Sea. Not the Red Sea. I'm right winged. - Hey, and do you fish? - No, I just watch. I put on my water glasses and I'm like Commander Cousteau. See? You have to get around. That must be Sabina. And we've got a plane to catch. - Have you packed everything, honey? - Of course. - Hi. - Hi. - What's up, dad? - Hi. I heard you couldn't stand it anymore at Luisa's place. No wonder. With that stupid Jorge - Exactly. Come with me. - So godfather, - You're so male chauvinist - I do what I can. - Come on, it's getting late! - I'll go and get my suitcase. Give grandpa a kiss. The kid comes too? We can't take her to London. - Dad, I'm leaving her here. - Great! Right, godfather? You'll have a great time with grandpa and grandfather. Poor thing. Staying here with three men. We'll see how I'll find her when I come back. Marisol, honey, don't listen to him, they're just a bunch of phallic minded guys. - Don't talk like that. - You're a radical feminist, you oppose the idea of the woman being an object, - but when the time comes, what? - What are you talking about? You go to London to buy nice threads, to dress up. Didn't you tell them why are we going to London? - No. - My sister is going to abort. - What? - Everything's ready. - Is that true? - What? That you're having an abortion in London. Sabina, why did you tell him? Did you hear that? - My own daughter. - Dad, you've got to understand. It's not that I don't want to have kids. I'll have kids, but later on. And you? Do you agree? You see, we... I don't know how to explain it. We have a plan. We want to live freely for a couple of years, enjoy life. - And go underwater fishing. - But dad... And you, what were you thinking of? - Don't you know him? - You say that as if I was a monster. - And you are the monster! - And you too. How can you stand here talking, calmly having coffee, when you're going to commit such a crime. Dad, don't get tragic. It's not a crime. Abortion is legal in many places. Besides, in Mónica's case, it's just like a delay in her period. We're running late. Dad, think it over. - Godfather, try and convince. - Of what? Relax, dad. You have to admit it. Women are no rabbits. See you. Admit it, she says. But I can't admit... I can't. I can't. - lf only Chencho was here... - Chencho? What? He would've talked her sister out doing that madness. He's a doctor and has authority. Why don't we go to visit Chencho? - To New York? - It would be great. He's single, free, without chains... One day we lost him, remember? But back then we found him. Now I may have lost him forever. Will he marry? Will he stay over there? Let him marry. It's okay. Sure. Sure. And what are we going to do in New York - if we don't know the language? - English? I'm an expert on the matter. Watch. Just like that. Come on, baby. Please, please. Please. That means please. Leave her alone. We've come here to drink, not to fool around. - Sit down. - Hello, boys. See? Drink? Making fun of me? Come on, doll, you're Spanish all the way. Hey, is that a picture? Wow! What a tribe! Lady, go to the bar and drink whatever you want, but at the bar. - What's wrong with this bore? - We have no place to go. We've got our baggage here. Like during the war. Just fleeing. - Do you want to drink something? - Waiter. Waiter. Poor thing. While I have a beautiful apartment. - Carlos. Everything is solved. - Godfather, come on! This lady is going to solve my future, at least for tonight. With this lady I don't' have any problems. I see two be problems. - May I? - Yes, because I'm leaving. No, don't do that. I'll do whatever the... If you want to make a fool of yourself, you're on your own, - but leave me alone. - Waiter. - Here. Keep the change. - Don't charge him. - Are you going to leave me alone - I've had it with you! - with these two beasts. - I've had it with all of them! - Carlos. - Stay with them and have fun. Don't leave me here. She's got an apartment. - Let me go. Let me go! - Mo. Let me go. - Call me a taxi, please. - I've had it too. I've had it with you, and all the rest. An old crock. That's what you are. You're getting old. You know? - You're one of the old people. - Your taxi, sir. Thanks. Haven't you solved your problem? - Yes. - Then leave me alone. What are you going to go alone, Carlos? - Don't leave. - Don't worry about me. You said it. I'm an old crock. I'm old. And where should old people be? In a home for old people. Isn't that what they call asylums? Sorry, I didn't mean to offend you. You know I love you. I love you all, Carlos. - Well... - Forget it. You have fun. I'm going to visit Carlota. Let him go. Don't you see he's embittered? Where? Where did he say he was going? To visit Carlota? Holy mother of God! Are... - are you sure he's my father? - That's what he said, but since he seems drunk, I didn't let him in. - Should I call the Head Sister? - No. I'll take care of it. Dad? Dad! Holy mother of God! What's wrong? What are you doing here so late? Nothing, honey. At least nothing serious. I've come here - to get admitted. - Admitted? - Where? - Here. Isn't this a home for old people? Nonsense! You've got your children. No, Carlota. No. Come in or you'll freeze to death. I'll get it. Go to bed. I'll do the night shift. - lf you need anything... - No. Go to bed, please. Dad, over here. You've been drinking. Yes. I was saying good bye to my adult age. How did Antonio let you get like this? - What's he got to do with this? - Weren't you staying at his home? Just temporarily, honey. Don't you know that? No. Forget it. It's best if I don't tell you anything. Come in. Now I need a bed, a room. - I'm very tired. - Okay. Stay here and don't move until I get back. Come on. Sit down and rest. Admit you? Here we admit only the ones who haven't got a family. Family. You sure had a family, , grandpa? If everyone else abandons me, I have to look up for myself. Otherwise, I'm less than nothing. That's what I am. It's the sad fate of retired people. Retirement is hell. That's the truth. You try and find the others. I can't find them. I too would like to know what's going on. Hurry! Sister, another drunk is asking for a room. Another one? Yes, there is another one. Go to bed. I'll take care of everything. Don't worry. Godfather! What's wrong with you? How can you come here like this? "Holy mother of God", Carlota. Your father? Did you admit your father yet? - You're drunk too? - Not so much know, but I have to confess you that we drunk... - Have you got any vacancies? - What a shame! Come on. What have you done? - In what mess have you gotten in? - Where's your father? Here. Come in. And don't move until I get back. - No. - Be patient. Carlos. Carlos, Carlos. Wake up, it's me. Forgive me. I should've stayed with you. Godfather, - what have you done? - I haven't done anything. It was those girls and their pimp. I didn't have any money so they hit me, they took my suitcase, my watch. Didn't you want excitement? There you have it. - I didn't do anything. - Let me see. Easy. It hurts. - Is it bad? - No. - Let's see if we can find a bathroom. - Yes. I told Carlota we were staying here. Forget Carlota. And how did you get here? Hitchhiking with truck drivers. - Which side was bleeding? - This one. Then lift this arm up. This one? - And stay still. - They say this stops bleed. Every day the same old song. Where are your manners? Can't you stop farting? It's not my fault. It's the cabbage, it causes lots of gasses. If you didn't serve cabbage this wouldn't happen. - See? - Come on. You're a rude man. Go back to your room immediately. When my kids brought me here, they told me it has like a five star hotel. Yeah, yeah. It's only the front. And they serve lots of cabbage. You're new around here, aren't you? Well, I advise you to get your things and start running. I can't, but one of these days... That nun drives me crazy! - This is not for us. - And what shall we do? Because Carlota must be doing our beds. Leave right now. They look awful. You just have to feel sorry for them. That bitch! And I'm stuck here. They're here, in the waiting room. But let's go first to my office. I want you to explain me what's been going on. What do you want me to explain? I haven't seen them... They left my house just like that. The only thing I know is that dad has changed. Your godfather has changed him. Didn't you say they were drunk? That fool! Did they say they want to stay? But what happened, Antonio? What happened? It's a long story. If they want to stay, let them stay. We'll pay for it. Paula, what I'm going to tell the community? My father in an asylum like he had no where to go. How can you say such a thing? I would take him home, but he'll probably won't accept after what happened. Here, here is where they should be. Paula! It's my father you're talking about. And my father has got 16 kids. But he's had problems with most of them. Ask them. Carlota, here they can control them, take good care of them. It's the best solution for them. Specially for your godfather. I can't stand him! See, godfather? All your life working, making sacrifices, living for your family and in the end... The asylum. Because Carlota called this place "asylum". "Asylum." And my shrew wife says I'm "doddering". "Doddering". Let's leave before I see her and I can't get a hold of myself. Yes. Let's go. Let them explain. They're not here. Where can they be? But... - Dad, where are you going? - You scared us to death. - What happened? - ¿Where are you going? Come to my house. I'll even throw my mother in law out. - I said it's okay. - Dad. My mother says she'll be like a sister for you. - Tell us. - It's just... your godfather and I have caused you enough problems. - What are you talking about? - What? And we've decided to life on our own. Each one in his house and God in all of them. Isn't that so, Carlota? And you, Antonio, relax, I'm not going to ask anything from you, even thought I know you'd give the world for me. And you too. You've clearly showed it. And I appreciate it. I appreciate it. I appreciate it too. We've been all our life together and when you started to leave... I kept this. You keep it now. And keep it for a while in each one's home. That will remind you that you've been a great family, that you are a great family. Yes, dad, but having you among us, - Like always. - Carlos is right, dad. If you come back home, I promised you everything will be different. And you'll come back to work with me. And if some day I shout at you, you can punch me. - Carlos, the marathon. - What? The marathon. We're running late. Sure. Let's do our thing. Where are you going? Here, your ring. You can keep it for ever. - Godfather! - Bye, kids! Leave them! They're completely right. - It must be here. - Look at this guys playing games. Hey, that's my father! And my godfather! Stop! Dad! Godfather! Dad! Hey, dad! Dad! Dad! Godfather! - What are you doing here? - Running the marathon. - Is anything wrong? - No. Nothing. Mercedes told me to come. Don't worry, my love. Your brothers will explain it to you. - Exactly. - Godfather! Dad! - Bye, María. - Doll face! What's the prize in this race? A trip to the Canary Islands. Fantastic. That way we can visit Victoria Eugenia. Another son in law? No way. I'd rather go running all the way to Palencia and stay with Luzgarda. She's single. No way, I'm going to go running to Palencia! The important thing, godfather, is that we're together, alone but together. And free! Free!
