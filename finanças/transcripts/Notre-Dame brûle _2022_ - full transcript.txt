"Everything is true, as implausible as it seems." A. Rivaroli NOTRE-DAME ON FIRE The door is open. - You're the new guy? - Yes. - Right on time. - Thank you. Good for you. Follow me! Were you trained? Yes. Tuesday and Thursday. Two hours. Almost two hours. How about that? Know how it works? Yeah, they showed me. I know it. Follow me. This is where you'll take your break. That's a repeater panel. Never take your eyes off it. That's the fridge. Those are the lockers. Bathrooms in the back. - Did you try on your uniform? - No. A little big! Better than the other way around. DANGER LEAD I've been on this job for a year. And you? Careful, buddy! Move your bus! It's a one-way street. You're going the wrong way! Are we seeing Mona Lisa? No, Uncle, here it's the Crown of Thorns. Come behold the wonder. Welcome to Notre-Dame Cathedral. A jewel of French Gothic architecture. The most visited in the world, an edifice that houses the most precious and venerated of relics. We're reinforcing the bearing points of the spire. To take the scaffold weight off the roof. Ok, understood. Here you see the Virgin and Child. The incarnation of Notre-Dame. It was placed here by Viollet-le-Duc in 1855, in front of a former altar, which during the Middle Ages was a high place of worship of Our Lady. This is the exact spot where David painted the famous "Coronation of Napoleon." Later appeared a young author, Victor Hugo, who at just 29 published a novel entitled The Hunchback of Notre-Dame. The main character, Quasimodo, who is half-blind and lame... Keep going! Only 200 steps to go! The structure supporting the roof, one of the oldest in the world, is made of oak trees planted 1,200 years ago, during the reign of Charlemagne. There is a total of 1,300 tree trunks. And finally, here we are in the Chapel of the Seven Sorrows. And now, you are standing before the holiest of Christian relics. The Crown cost an astronomical sum, putting France in debt for 35 years. Debt, a French passion! 135,000 pounds. A fortune that put France on its knees for 50 years. In French history, it is the most precious and most expensive... The wavy red glass of the reliquary evokes the crimson cloak the Son of God was made to wear in mockery, to show him as a sham king. Behind the glass here, you see a beige linen tunic worn by Saint Louis on his return from the Crusades. He asked his confessor for this small flagellation chain to whip himself. You can see traces of blood. - Hello? - It's Mr. Merlin, your boss. Sorry this falls on you. There's a hitch with the afternoon guy. His papers aren't in order. Can you stay till 11 p.m.? Yes, that shouldn't be a problem. I just need... to call my wife. Of course. Good luck! The kids are tired of waiting. What am I supposed to do? I'm sick of you. I know. I don't have a choice. Same old song! You don't give a shit about us. What do I tell them? That it's never your fault? Is that it? EASTER MONDAY MASS 6:15 PM But the chief priests then decided to kill Lazarus also, because he was the reason many Jews were deserting them and believing in Jesus. Let us praise the word of God. 6:17 PM Alarm! Alarm: fire, attic, nave... Alarm! Alarm: fire, attic... sacristy! Copy sacristy attic, I'm on it. Excuse me. CHAPTER SACRISTY fire attic nave sacristy Control post? Yes? I'm in the sacristy attic. Nothing unusual. False alarm. It's still blinking. The evacuation announcement is gonna go off. Don't worry. The system's been acting up for years. I keep reporting it, but nobody gives a hoot. I give up! On my way. Your attention, please. For safety reasons, the building is closing to the public. Please stay calm and leave by the nearest exit. Mommy, can I have a coin to light a candle? Some other time. You heard the message. Come along. I promise. They're asking us to leave. Damn alarms are a pain in the ass. And now during mass! You've reached... Please leave a message after the tone. Excuse me, Mr. Merlin, but an alarm has gone off. 6:35 PM Give me the code. The guard said the sacristy was fine, but... The code! ZA-110- L2- 15-L1. Is that the alarm I hear? Yes. Turn it off. Orange button. Ladies and gentlemen! The alert has been lifted. False alarm. Feel free to return to the cathedral. Mass will be resuming. The alert has been lifted! It's safe to go in. Enjoy your visit! I'm giving you your coin now, but light the candle only after mass. Ok? 6:42 PM Jean-Pierre, act fast! It's not the sacristy attic, it's the nave! The forest. Yes, sir, the nave attic. What's going on? There's a rehearsal later. 14 musicians. I'm checking up there. - The forest? Really? - Yeah. 300 steps up with your asthma, that's tough. I'm coming with you. I'm sick of these false alarms. The system needs checking. PARIS FIRE BRIGADE HEADQUARTERS On bus 85? Her water broke? A dog on the beltway? No collisions, no accidents? DISPATCH CENTER The elevator is stuck? Someone's inside? Between two bars? Your child's head is stuck in the railing? PARIS FIRE BRIGADE 6:45 PM 28 min. after fire detected It's Mathieu. - How's Italy? - Nice. I sent you a pic of smoke at Notre-Dame. A friend took it. It may be a fake. You know anything? Hello, fire brigade? I'm at number 121, Rue de la Vacquerie. My kitten is sliding off the roof. He got out. Kitty! MAJOR GENERAL GONTIER LIEUTENANT GENERAL GALLET Jean-Claude, any news on Notre-Dame? Got a strange call. A friend from police HQ on vacation in Italy. Florence. Look at this. Dispatch says they know nothing. It's gotta be fake. Well, it sure looks real. - Shouldn't we check? - Let's go to the Comm Center. PARIS MAYOR'S OFFICE Look over there. There's smoke. I don't know what it is... It can't be Notre-Dame. Notre-Dame can't burn. Wait, I'll call Karine. Yes, Karine... We see some smoke. I don't know. It's strange. Over by Notre-Dame. Just in case, could you call General Gallet to see if anything's going on? I smell smoke, don't you? What's that noise? Move away from the door. Security! Call the fire brigade! There's a fire in the attic! Yes, it's serious! Hurry! We have to get everyone out! You think it might be arson? When I was on the force, that was our first hunch. And up there's the best place to burn the house down. ISIS has threatened twice to attack Notre-Dame. VERSAILLES PALACE 15 miles from Paris Good evening! Go ahead. - 'Evening. - 'Evening, sir. Mr. Prades. Curator of Notre-Dame. No, just general manager. Over by the garden. Enjoy your evening. Good evening. How are you? Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me! Smoke coming from the roof? How much smoke do you see? Do you see flames? What color is the smoke? Stay calm. Anything on Notre-Dame? Yes, General. Lots of calls. We sent out a first alarm response. I need an NCO report on aerial platform truck availability. Jean-Marie, I'll follow you. I should follow you. You're my superior. You're on call tonight. - Jean-Claude... - Notre-Dame is on fire. Expect a media frenzy, politicians, celebs. Two fires to handle. Deal with the cathedral. 6:51 PM Poissy Firehouse 1/2 mile from Notre-Dame Respond to fire Rue du Cloître Notre-Dame. We'll go via Rue des Écoles, Rue de Bièvre, Quai Montebello and Pont au Double bridge. First hydrant, second hydrant. Let's roll! Let's go! Let's go! Brigade! We're heading out! Engine Golfe 2. Poissy duty officer. Responding to fire. Rue du Cloître Notre-Dame. Roger that. Over. Go down to Rue de Bièvre. Not again! Please evacuate! Quickly, please. Everyone out! There's a fire in the attic. Evacuate! Jonas! Evacuate! There's a fire up there! Please, everyone, hurry up. Evacuate immediately! No, Chloé! What're you doing? Excuse me. Stop that! OFFERING Sweetie, don't disappear like that! Didn't you hear? There's smoke outside. I just saw a flame. Over by the spire. Come on, firefighters, quit dawdling! They won't be long. What a disaster. Eight centuries, can you imagine? We should call your mother. Damn bike! Go move it. - Ok? - Yeah! Ok, drive. Can I have a piece? Here. - It's my first fire. - Me too. I owe you one. Outta the way! Watch out! Clear the way! Clear the way! Watch out! Clear the way! Outta the way! Move! Stop here. - Can you get through? - No! Too tight. Back her up! We're backing up, please. Ma'am, don't stay there! Don't stay there, people. We have to back up. Warrant Officer Davril requesting additional units Rue du Cloître Notre-Dame. Entity ID: Notre-Dame Cathedral. Requesting aerial truck and Special Operations Unit. Anyone inside? Public evacuated. Building secured. Roof fire. Building empty. Command Post set up Notre-Dame Plaza. Pursuing reconnaissance. Blasted siren. What'd he say? Pursuing reconnaissance? That's not good. It means "disaster foretold." Back up! Excuse me! As quick as I can. - Dammit! - Asshole! Asshole yourself! Sorry, My Lord. I'm on my way! Sorry. I'm so sorry! Watch it, you lunatic! You want our aerial from Versailles? Have you seen the TV? Of course I want it. I need your 150-foot from Versailles. Mine are 105-foot and the roof is 165 ft up. Forget official channels. It'll take too long. Thanks. This is unbelievable. Look at this mess. VERSAILLES FIREHOUSE It's not a joke! It's a real picture. I just got it. Yes, I always have the key. I have to hang up. My battery's low. Decision-making time for Emmanuel Macron. He will respond to the Yellow Vest protests in 30 min. The future of his term is at stake. 7:02 PM 7:04 PM Standpipe hookup. Go check it out. Jordan, I asked for more units. You and your crew, north transept. And hit the standpipe. Got it. Up there, give me a size-up. And be careful. Over this way. Team 1, we're off. Ok, here we go. - Following behind? - Right behind you. Watch yourselves. Ok, guys, up we go. Keep up the pace. Come on! Duty officer? Poissy sergeant here. Go ahead. Sergeant, duty officer here. Go ahead. 7:17 PM 1 HOUR AFTER FIRE DETECTED I report, locked door. No attic access. Roger. Locked door. Over. Ascent halted on north transept stairs by locked door. Capt. Marcus Poiret-Clerc. I'll command operations. Captain, survey the fire, then radio initial size-up. Request artwork protection material. Building evacuated. No casualties... Yet. High calorific potential. The blaze is likely to spread to the entire edifice. Pursuing recon. Excuse me. Thanks. The custodian's son lost the pass key. That's why we're in a jam. Thanks. - It works. - Opening! - Thanks. Don't stay here. - Wait. Got it! - Good luck. - Let him by. Another 80 steps. Let's get going. ELYSÉE PALACE I'll go to the scene as soon as conditions... Lay the hoses on the left. Go no farther. Marianne, position the hose line here. We'll use the standpipe. Sandro, recon under the roof. Find the seat of the fire. Got it. Use the thermal imaging camera. You know the drill. Let's go. Stand here. Mask up! Anchor yourself to the door. Anchored. Alright? I'm good! Wait. Control your breathing. Ok, go up. - Watch the steps. - Got it! One. Two. Three. Four. Three more steps. Got it. I'm suffocating. I'm having trouble breathing. Adjust your mask. Breathe deep. Careful. We're on a catwalk. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Hang on. - Your helmet's blistering. - What? Your helmet's blistering! So is yours. 920° F It's too hot. Back out! - You lead. - Got it! Eighteen. Seventeen. Sixteen. Fourteen! My ears are roasting. How many steps? Thirteen. Two. One. We're out! I'm in position. Charge the line! Charging! Sandro. Size-up? After the first door, we went up a dozen steps. After 15 ft, we had to stop due to the heat. We backed out. Couldn't find the seat. Take a breather and stand ready. We'll need another line. What's going on? Why's there no water? I'm not getting water! Open it up! It's as far as it'll go. No pressure, Sarge! Increase pressure. As high as it'll go. There must be a kink. Still not enough pressure! Increase pressure, Florian. We're getting nothing! It's at its max. Progress is impossible! Only one First Response truck. General Gontier here. Rescue the artwork while we can. The Special Artwork Unit is notified. ETA 30 min. You're on your own. Paris is gridlocked. General Gallet here. Remember the Fire Brigade's code of honor: "When you call, I rush. "But be sure to use the fastest "and surest channels. "Your wait will seem long, very long." My predecessor added, "but despite your distress, "forgive my apparent slowness." Any pressure? Look for kinks! Check for kinks on the other side. Check for kinks! Backing out. It's useless. Got a kink here. I'm too hot! Yes, it's me. Notre-Dame is burning. It is! Yes, but they can't do anything. They're in danger. Look on TV. It's burning. It smells like the anti-termite treatment they sprayed, remember? I'm fine. But it's hot. Really hot! I'm taking command! Colonel. Look out! Move back! Lead! Move back! Lead! All we have is a First Response, two active lines and a leaky standpipe. All this is useless. It shows we're here, that firefighters are doing their best. To end up charred under the ruins? Engine 225, rear entrance. Electricity's off. Be right back! Corporal, take the second nozzle! Get under the pinnacle, attack the timbers from below. Got it, Sarge! Sandro, take her nozzle. Got it. Stay here. The stone staircase'll collapse last. Team 2! I need help! Captain, we have no pressure. There's a kink. Straighten it. Sandro! Go straighten the kink! You ok? Look at me, Sandro. Know how many firemen would want to be here? So let's go. Put down your visor and go! Go! Go! Come back! - You ok? - Yeah! Take the nozzle. Give it to me. Focus on the scaffolding. Cool it down. If it collapses, the cathedral goes down and so do we! There, there! Please! We're securing the bridge. Move along! Back up! Hook up the Y! MOBILE COMMAND POST SPECIAL SUPPORT UNIT It's burning under the spire and at the scaffolding. There are teams up in the south and north transepts. This shows the roof vault. Debris is falling into the cathedral through an oculus. The general's coming! Forward! Hydrant insufficient on Île de la Cité. Plug hookup underway Île Saint-Louis. Approx. distance: 1.25 miles. Fireboat has left base. Two locks to go through. ETA: 50 minutes. Telemeter set up Rue du Cloître facing south transept gable. Massena aerial platform truck deployed, corner of south belfry. General! General, I'm head architect, like Mr. Villeneuve. I must warn you: the building's fragile. The stone's porous. It's 12th century. It's like blotting paper. Then you choose. What? Between water and fire. Alright. Now I'll go do my job. We have three priorities. First, the scaffolding. 500 tons of it. If it bows... Jean-Marie's on call tonight. He's in command. I'll command operations, Captain. General Gontier's taking over. Spread the word. Second priority. Lieutenant, your mission: Don't let the fire spread to the belfries. I want an attack point between the towers. Up on the terrace, to support the aerial truck. Yes, sir. Last, and I should've started with this. Rescue the artwork. The cathedral can be rebuilt, not the relics, or priceless treasures it contains. General, Captain Francis is in command of the Seine sector and artwork retrieval. Trained at the Louvre. General. - I'm counting on you. I'm Monsignor Charley, rector of the cathedral. Come, My Lord. Captain, I beg you, of all things, save the Crown of Thorns. Alright. I can't reach Laurent Prades. Seen him? - Who? - Laurent Prades. No, not at all. Until you find him, this is Céline. Heritage curator. She'll explain everything meanwhile. So all these pieces can be accessed via the sacristy? Yes, but the list is incomplete. Inventory's not done. But the Crown is in the axial chapel. The Seven Sorrows. Along the ambulatory, second side chapel in the apse. How do I recognize it? - What, the Crown? - Yes. It's like what you saw in the Louvre in paintings of the crucifixion. Ok. Come with me. And put up your hood. We really need Laurent Prades. Sorry, but who's he? Céline, wait! I've got him! Saint-Michel's closed. I got off at Orsay. I know, My Lord! Yes. Of course I have it. I always carry it on me. As fast as I can, My Lord. I don't believe this! The wind has shifted from E to NE. The Massena aerial truck on Square Jean XXIII will set up at corner of the south belfry. Do you read me? Go ahead. Roger that. Over. Over here! Please evacuate. It's this way. Stay here. It's toward the back. You can't miss it. In a reliquary. A display case. Guys, with me. Hug the walls. It's raining debris. Go on, force it open. Sergeant, tell CP we recovered the Crown. CP truck for Captain Francis. Reporting we have retrieved the Crown of Thorns. Thank You, Lord. Thank You for giving back this relic that brings us closer to You. Father! Padre, Chaplain, look, we found it. It's not the real one. It's a decoy, a facsimile. A vegetal likeness. Not the real Crown of Thorns. What do you mean? I'm a Knight of the Holy Sepulcher. I've held the crown in my hands. It's in a safe in the chapel. We need a key and a code. Who has the key? Laurent Prades. Move back, please. I live right over there. Let me by. Stand back. Make way for the firefighters. It's like they don't hear us. We'll never get through. Follow the colonel's EMS truck. Location in sight for Versailles aerial truck stuck in traffic. Almost there. 200 yards to go. Pull out! Sarge, your crew! You heard him! Firefighters, pull out! Evacuate! Team 1, bring up the rear. Good evening, all. This Monday night's news: a major conflagration in Notre-Dame Cathedral. Fire broke out in the attic just before 7 p.m. We just learned some 20 minutes ago that Emmanuel Macron has postponed his address to go to the Notre-Dame Cathedral. Help me open the door! Move over! I have four guys inside! Watch your head. Hurry! The fumes are toxic! The captain doesn't have his mask. Oh, man, I don't believe it! Sandro, try! Hang on. It's locked on the other side. Poissy duty officer for Poissy sergeant. Go ahead. You alright, Captain? Door blocked, north transept. Can't evacuate. I repeat: can't evacuate! The rescue hood! We need help. We're trying to enter the building. Hang in there. Roger. We'll cope. Get the rescue hood on him. Hang in there. Only 100 bars left. It's me again, Rue de la Vacquerie. My little kitten got out. He's sliding off the roof. Yes. He's slipping! He can't hold on much longer. My little kitten! Come with the big ladder! You're here, General? My respects. They're shaken, but unharmed. - Anyone else inside? - I don't think so! I don't want anyone under that! Gen. Gallet here: ceiling vault pierced by spire, burning smoke evacuating by flue effect, risk of explosion diminished, risk of collapse increased. Thank you, Corporal. DRONE UNIT Please, let me through... Fire scene safety area, no one goes through. The key to the Holy Crown! Sure. - I'm the cathedral general manager! - Everyone's a bishop today. Move back! Thank you. Behind the tape, ma'am. Stop him! Police! Halt! - Let go of me! - Your ID! You there? Behind the door! - Coming out! - Go on. - Get Captain Marcus. - We're going. Come on! Stand ready. The President's coming. Activate mirror CP. Act like it's the real one! Here's the board. - Remote screen sharing. - Done. Mirror CP operational. Exact replica. Don't worry, they'll buy it. I'll intercept them before they get underfoot. Good luck. Send me good news. I won't be disturbing you often. THE SPIRE COLLAPSED MACRON ON SITE Mr. President! Take a breather. Open your turnouts. Swap tanks. Stand ready to go in again. - Better, Captain? - Yeah. Two issues: The wind is turning. It's shifted north toward the belfry. Second, the temperature. Over 2,200° F. Ok. Switching to exterior attack. With all possible units. All aerial trucks and fireboats. Put me on the main channel. Make sure Colossus shows up. We're here to cool down the gable! The fire mustn't reach the belfry. Roger that? - Lieutenant? - Yes? The standpipe is giving out... Sergeant, I give the orders! I know what to do. Sorry, sir. I'm not ivy league. My parents aren't rich. Right, great. Asshole. I swear... Fucking officers. General Gontier to all firefighters. General evacuation. I want no one inside or on the building. Wait! We're switching to exterior attack. Guys! Anchor the hoses and get out! Risk of collapse. Evacuate! What'd he say? Place is coming down. Gotta go! Colossus ETA? 8 minutes. We need it now. Now! We can still win this with all available assets. Status on the fireboats? Where's the damned safe? What's it look like? Gimme some light. I can't see. Guys, I found it. Is there a reference on your label? We found the safe. Now we need the key. Where is it? Anyone have it? Me! I'm the stage manager. I have a key to the sacristy. I have that key, too. This box has the key to the main closet. Then what? It contains 700 keys. - And? - We have to find the right key. My boss knows. Who's your boss? Don't say Laurent... Prades. - Move! - Here he is! Out of the way! This one. Only one person with Mr. Prades! The ministry guy! Mr. Prades, beware of debris. Be careful. Don't lose eye contact with me. Your helmet. You too. Wet your scarves and cover your mouths. It's for the fumes. Here! We have to break this to access the safe. That's not it... I know the code. But I'm panicking. I'm drawing a blank. Helmet on. Who else has it? The head sacristan. The network is saturated. Send a text. Hurry... CODE TO THE CROWN!!!! QUICK!!!!! Come on! Laurent, let me try. I'm usually lucky. You never know. TACTICAL SUPPORT UNIT That's Colossus? Yup. Colossus-Rex. Like tyrannosaurus. CODE TO THE CROWN!!!! QUICK!!!!! Guys, don't take your eyes off them. At the first alert, get them out. Corporal, got a good angle grinder? - What for? - The Crown of Thorns. To CP: operation underway inside cathedral... Excuse me. I'm really sorry, but it's my job to tell you. The flying buttresses are weakening. The walls are spreading. If the building shifts, the scaffolding will collapse. Two teams are hosing down the scaffolding nonstop. And the north transept gable is receding from the vault. I spoke to Villeneuve about it. We need to stop watering it down. The weight of the water... If someone has a better idea, let me know. That's it! Of course! Move over! 0... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 1, 2, 3. Well done. We did it. Take this. Take this, too. There's also a piece of the true cross, a vial of Christ's blood, and a crucifixion nail. I have it in my pocket. Come on... Hang in there, little buddy. Charge the hose. Go on. Ok. Is that the best it can do? More pressure, dammit! Colossus pilot for CP truck. Increase pressure. It's at its max. Bring Colossus back. And get me Gen. Gallet. Well done, Laurent. Should I announce that the Crown is saved? We did 30 min. ago. Let's not confuse them. Colossus can't reach the seat of the fire. It's spread to the belfries. The north tower especially. Once the support beams weaken, the bells will bring down the facade. The building is too compromised for us to send in men. So far, there have been no casualties. And it's the first rule of our fire brigade: I can ask my men to risk their lives to save other lives, not to save stones. No matter what stones. Mr. President, the cathedral may well collapse. There is one last option. A volunteer squad. A suicide mission. But I need your approval. It's under your responsibility. We can always rebuild a cathedral, not the life of a firefighter or their family. None of us want to relive the tragedy we went through a few months ago. We do not want to relive the sad spectacle of coffins in our firehouses. Excuse me. What's gotten into you, Sergeant? Why are you among senior officers? Colonel, sir, I just went up the north belfry. There's a leak in the standpipe, the stairs are flooded, but the belfry's holding up. The fire hasn't reached the beams that support the bells. We'll have to use the south stairs. With a few men, we still have a 15-min. window to act. We have to go up on the terrace. Are you sure of yourself? Yes, sir. Certain. Jean-Claude, you sure he realizes the risk? Of course. The President was quite clear. In short, silence is consent. Alright. We have a green light to recruit volunteers for a last-ditch mission. A suicide mission. With a risk level that is fully understood and accepted. You? Most of my men have children. We're happy to do our duty, but this... I understand. General. Lieutenant. I listened to Sergeant Reynald's plan. Who? General, an NCO from my battalion has a proposal. My respects, General. I know the cathedral well and I love it. That's why I'm being so bold. I just went back up the north belfry. It's standing strong. I propose that with a few men, we go back up on the terrace with six 2 1/2-inch hoses. The standpipes gave out. We can unfurl from up top, along the facade, and hook them up directly to the pumpers. I think we can do it. Sir, my men and I volunteer. Me too! Me too. General, permission to accompany these men. Bring them back alive. Watch out ahead! The staircase collapsed! Louis IX paid for this crown with the Kingdom's treasury. It now belongs to the French Republic. I am its representative. So... Thank you. Who's there? What're you doing? Padre Boulanger? Forgive me, Father. You can't stay here. It's dangerous. Warrant Officer Ibrahim, I rescued the holy hosts, the living body of Christ. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. It's blocked, Lieutenant! Crew chief, set up a point of attack. What's this? Guides' staff room. Ok, let's go! We need more units. CP for Lt. Alexandre: Request two additional teams. Go ahead. I repeat: CP for Lt. Alexandre. Request two additional teams. Go ahead! Network's saturated. No transmission. I'll scout it out. I weigh the least. Reynald, set up a line at the entrance. Got it? Got it, Lieutenant. Let's go! It's too narrow to pass. Climb over me. Go on! Going over you, Sarge. There. Roll 'em out. I'm coming, Lieutenant! You're soaked. You'll steam cook! Extinguish the floor first. Sir, ready for the line? Throw it up! Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now, and at the hour of our death. Amen, amen, hallelujah. Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Yes, to the right! The hose stream's a sprinkle! Too low to reach the seat. The water just vaporizes. Colonel, we requested more lines and units. No one's answering. We won't get any. It's five men max. What if the bell falls? I request permission to go up. You're soaked. Stay here. I'm dry, Colonel. I went over the water. I clung to the wire fencing. I can try to climb up. Lieutenant! Give me more hose! Enough! General, Colonel Michelon here. In the north belfry, the fire is out. I repeat. The fire is out. My second fire might be a bit disappointing. Here, piece of gum. Told you I owed you one. The President is back in the cathedral. The fire is definitely contained. By some miracle, no firefighters were killed or even seriously injured. The 1,300 works of art in the Treasury were all recovered and are safely stored at City Hall. 850 years after its construction, Notre-Dame of Paris is still standing.
