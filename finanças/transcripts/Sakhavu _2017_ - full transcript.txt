Kichu! Don't be so arrogant! When you prepare food, why can't you make it clean? Hey Kichu! Where are you going? - I'm leaving! Have dinner & go! - I don't want dinner! Where are you off to, at midnight? Elm E Pour some water for him! - The chicken down there; put it in! You want Dosa, right? - Huh? - Dosa, right? Ya. Shall I serve chicken too? - Ya. Yes, Mahesh! - Where are you Kichu? I've been waiting for so long! In. I have reached the town. I'll come rig ht now. I'm having food. Oh! Is it? When I'm starving here waiting for you, you're sitting there & hogging? Oh! You didn't have food? Since it's so late, I thought. Where are you now? I'll come there. Inna No. I'm done here. I'll get a parcel. OK? By e. What do you want as parcel? Dosa? Ya. - Shall I keep some chicken too? No! No! Just pack Dosa & Chutney alone! You don't have soap here? Hey! Most people don't use soap these days. People like their hands to be oily after eating. The smell of masala, rig ht? Evenl like it! But not today. You could've bought an omelette at least! Dude, they didn't have any! I swear! It was over. What did you eat? Me? Dosa & Chutney! I swear! What is it? You had Dosa made of soap or what? Stop kidding and eat it fast! We have to plan our activities. - Maybe my nose went wrong! - He won't lie! Mahesh, do you know what are the basic qualities that a politician should have? Well.. The people.. It's not about the people! Pay attention! Point No.1 We should have a complete sense of our skills and the belief in them! We should believe that whatever we do is rig ht! Two. We should also have a complete sense of our limitations. We should realize that we are not skilled in certain fields. But don't ignore them! - No! We should figure out how to overcome those limitations. So what about thick skin? That's a usage coined by mimicry artists to mock us! Is it? Actually, that's not related to being thick skinned! It's all about our self-confidence! The self-confidence that our lives won't be spoiled just because of some allegation or charge-sheet. Even if the world falls apart, don't step down from positions of power. Just say that there's no proof or that the law is taking its course. Done! Three. The ability to fall on four legs, however we fall! Or, the attitude to say that if we catch a rabbit, it will have 3 horns! Why did you say that now? Hold your horses! That's the 4th quality. Whoever says whatever, don't react or make a statement immediately! Next is the fifth one. The reason we are here today. Whoever becomes an obstacle in our path, we should eliminate them at the right time! If we keep it for later, we might not be able to handle it. So, at the right time; In a way that there's no damage to the leaf or the thorn, right? Dude, even if the leaf and thorn are damaged, there shouldn't be any damage to us. Got it? He is Rajeev! He's doing his PG at SA College. I know Rajeev. Isn't he the district vice-president of our union? That's now. But he can even become the district secretary in future. Most probably! There is a possibility. So? We should get rid of him. - How? No matter how! You mean... Should we kill him? No! We needn't kill him. We just have to scare him. Will he be scared? - Dude, I'm not talking about scaring him with a knife. A slight inertia. When he's about to enter political work actively, he should get an inner calling. Will he get it? We should make sure he gets it. For that, he has to be beaten up. Us? We shouldn't be involved directly! That's why we need Bennychayan's help. That hard-slapper Benny? - Ya. Will he beat up a member of our party? Yes. He will. I don't understand anything. Dude, hear me out. Or else.. Watch this! Rajeev, who is walking towards the market junction. Red Salute! Red Salute! Come. Hop on! - Of course! Stop right there! Where are you going? Oh God! Goons! Goons from our opposite party! Catch him! Drag him out! Take him! - Kichu! - Aren't we on the same team? - Hit me on my hand! Oh my God! Sorry! Did it hurt? Go beat him up! Don't hit me! Why are you hitting me? Help! Kichu! Don't hit me! Who are you guys? Didn't we tell you earlier? If you dare to continue political work hereafter, we will finish both of you! - No! Never again! Got it? - Sorry brother! I'll do something. I will go crawling. Rajeev! Are you hurt badly? Oh! I understood! You are hurt badly! Anyway» I have decided something today, Rajeev. I'm not continuing active politics anymore. If I do, they will come again! I'm backing out, Rajeev. I'm backing out. You are rig ht, Krishnakumar! I've had it! I'm backing out, Krishnakumar! You're over-doing it! Over here! This side! Your acting is too over the top! Sheesh! - I don't mind that! Dude, it's not the acting which is important. It's the planning! Didn't it work out? I made him say that he will back out, right? That's enough! It will all fall in place when it actually happens! All that's fine! - Thank you! But shall I ask you something? Move! Suppose.. I'm not continuing active politics anymore! If I do, they will come again! I'm backing out, Rajeev! I'm backing out! Krishnakumar! Were you such a coward? Are you going to leave the party you loved more than your life? I can't do that! This attack is like an energy boost to me! An energy boost to lead the party strongly! Long Live The Revolution! Dialogues might not be the same. Hey! He won't say that. What if he does? Are you with me or him? I'm with you! If so, he won't say that dialogue. If he does, I know what to do next. Okay. But as per the plan, he has to come where you are at that time, right? He has to be called there. Who will call him? Me! Will he come if you call him at that time? What if he says no? He won't say no! He cannot say no. Both of you? He will come if I call him. He is a close friend of mine. You devil! You want to send people to beat up your own close friend? Point No.6 In politics, there's no father, mother or friend. If they block our path... Haven't you heard it? However fruitful a tree maybe, if it grows above the house; we have to cut it! So, will you do the same to me? I won't do anything to you! I know that you won't grow much. There are many good people like Rajeev in our party. Will you get rid of all of them? If I have to. You know rig ht? I am not scared of anyone. Rajeev! Go and open the door! - No! I won't! Open m I won't open it! - Obey your leader! Go! I'm scared, dude. I swear! Shall I open it? - Ya. Open it. Who is it? Comrade? Oh! It's you? I was just checking since the light was on, at midnight. How come you're not sleeping? Yes. We are going to sleep. Krishnakumar, now.. SFK's district joint secretary. Not that. What do you do now? Are you studying? - Yes. DTP. DTP? - Yes. Well.. Software“ Com puter.. C++ And I'm trying for LLB at the academy as well! Okay then! You don't have to study anything, just to be a part of SFK. Ya right! As if he's the one who decides all that! He has a point! You're studying just to be a pan of SFK, right? Yes. I'm studying only for that. - Why do you have to do that? Isn't it better to work full time for the party? Hey M... Mahesh! Didn't I tell you earlier? Time! Correct time! That is very important! If I quitSFK now, it will be bad for me. I will quit. Not now. After 2 years. Within those 2 years, I will become the district secretary of SFK. I will be a state committee member as well. And gradually, I will shift to DYFK. By then, I would get a membership in the party. With the contacts I make while I am in the state committee, I will be able to enter the DYFK district committee directly. Maybe, into the state committee as well. And after one and a half years, there will be an assembly election. According to the thesis approved during the last Party congress, the youth will have more prominence in that election. If that's the case, young people would be considered as candidates in our constituency. Because, here there are no veteran comrades who can't be replaced. Since this is a constituency which has more Nairs (caste), and since non-Nairs have never won here; party will obviously select a Nair youth as the candidate. At that point of time, there will be chances for three people, including me. Out of the three, I know how and when to get rid of the other two. After that, MLA, Minister, Chief Minister. I have planned all that. Will all this happen? We should make it happen! We have to work for that! Not for the people. For us! We have to work out our plans intelligently according to the situations. And the first step towards that, is this attack against Rajeev. It's politics, dude! Shall we sleep? Switch off the lights! I've told you many times not to wear the blanket. - Should I walk naked then? I can't see anything. I have to speak to Bennychayan tomorrow morning itself! Can you move a little, Kichu? Assistants should be sleeping on the floor! Thank you. Kichu, You can do all this even if you choose the right path like our comrades, right? I can, but it will take a lot of time! I don't have patience. Kichu, Don't do anything to me in the dark. I will always be a loyal slave to you. Shut up and go to sleep! Kichu, What? Are you sure there was no more chicken fry? Oh my God! - Sleep on the floor! Kichu! Aren't you done? Point No.7 A politician should always have his weapon, that is his phone, with him! Here you go. - What is it? Yes Comrade! No. I'm at the AC office. Why not? I'll arrange that. I will send you a phone number. Well.. No.. I had some work... No! Hello? What is it? I'm done for! I've reached the medical college. Where are they? - I think it's that way. Must be there. - Hey. How long will this take? 15 minutes, maximum! I have a lot of other work. 15 minutes to donate blood? If I say 15 minutes, I mean it! Point No.8 Clarity about the things you're going to do. But how will you do it in 15 minutes? I will annoy them! I will annoy the hell out of them and make them ask me to leave! Come! Watch & learn! Annoy them! Who wants blood here? Kichu, this is a hospital. Who doesn't need blood here? There's a patient here who needs blood, right? A comrade'.! Inna Area Secretary Kuria Sir sent me here. This blood donation campaign is a programme by SFK. At the district level, we have done around.. Com e. - Huh? What? Let's go to the lab. I didn't finish talking! As a leader of SFK.. - It's okay. We can give it for cross-matching. Okay! You're awesome, Kichu! This could've taken such a long time. But with just one lame dialogue of yours, things moved so swiftly! Hey. Will it be a problem if those 15 minutes are extended to half an hour? Why? We can add today's breakfast in this account. I was going to say that. I had forgotten about it. Hey! Brother! Well, shall we eat something and then go there? Well.. We can do that after you donate blood, right? The nutrition value of blood that I'm donating shouldn't be less. Not just that. That's how it is, right? And we haven't had breakfast too. - Buy it for us, uncle! APPam, (So) No Appam. Only Parotta, Chappathi & Masala Dosa. Parotta! For all three of you? No. I'll have just a tea. Nowl know! You already had breakfast, rig ht? No. I'll have it later. So that's better. Just for two of us. And curry? Chicken? Beef! Get beef. Chicken & beef are not ready yet. Egg or vegetable curry. It's okay. Bring an egg curry. Three eggs extra. Boiled! For both of you? - Ya. No! He doesn't need it! I'm the one who's donating blood. So I should be eating more! Kichu! Then get it for him too. What if we need his as well? Blood! So ya.. Blood is something which we really need. You know rig ht? Be it the person who's donating it or receiving it! This blood is a pan of the body of the person who's donating it, right? So when this blood is lost, one can feel really tired. That's what these eggs are for. But the yellow of the egg; that's full of fat. And the white is full of protein! We can get proteins from milk as well. Oops! We didn't ask for milk! Ya. We haven't. Bro, milk! In a tall glass! Don't shout. They will come here. Are you happy now? - Ya. What you did now; that's called a political burp! The pleasure of hogging for someone else's money; will we get that if we stay at home? - No! That's it! Are you really going to donate your blood? I haven't decided. - You haven't? Kichu! Wait! Well, if you annoy them too much; what about your image then? Wage';? Buddy, why should I care about my image in front of these people from the hills? Point No.9 We should be good only in front of people who will be useful for us. Even if we have to do all sons of crooked things, we have to be good in front of them, always! Got it? Keep it folded. Hey! Is that enough? I am donating it to someone. Take some more. What if it's not enough? This is for cross-matching, right? Oh! Then say it clearly! Dude, Bennychayan is calling. Hello Bennychaya! Just a second. Can I know what my blood group is? Hello? Hey! I just asked my blood group, not your phone number, right? What are you saying, Bennychaya? I understood! I will promise one thing. No one will know about this. If they know, I'll also be in trouble, right? Don't say anything! You have to do it for me, because our bond is such! Right? That's true, right? My need is your need as well, right? Anyway, you should operate the plan within today evening. Okay? We'll discuss the rest of the details in person. Okay. Bye. What is it? He's asking if Kuria Sir knows about it, will it be a problem and all that! Not just Benny, I can fool even his grandpa! Don't you have to call Rajeev now? I'll meet him in person. No. I'll call him. We'll meet Benny in person. Let's get out of here first. Com e. Did you see a moustached guy? - Moustached? A big man.. Who came with us. A dark, ugly grandpa! No such person came here. He didn't come? Hey Mister! What did you do right now? You made us wait there and came back here? That.. That's because both of you left from there. - No! Who left? For what? Why? If we wanted to leave, we wouldn't have come only! You should understand something. I didn't come asking for blood, to you for me! Instead, I've come here with my rare blood group, for you! O Negative! Do what I said. - Okay Doctor. It's because you don't know my busy schedule. I am the district joint secretary of a students' union! Hello! Look here! I am a comrade with thousands of commitments. If I can leave my busy schedule and come here, why can't you wait there? Hey! What's the problem? - Let it be! You are a doctor? Doctor, try and make him understand; about the availability of O Negative blood group. If this is the situation of an SFK District Joint Secretary, what will be the condition of ordinary students at the blood donation camp? Come, let's go to the room and discuss. No. That's not necessary. I was just trying to make them understand. Please come. Let's go! Okay! Is he an actual doctor? - Of course! Can't you see? He might have become one unknowingly. Just that he doesn't look like one. - Good. I want to talk to him privately. Must be about some transfer. I'll be right back. Com e. Wait. Wow. So many bottles! This doesn't look like your consultation room, Doctor. I don't need any particular room for this. I didn't get you. - I'll make it clear. What was that show you put up over there? What? Goondaism, is it? Only you can do goondaism or what? Do you know who you're talking to? Whoever you are, why would I care? Remember that you're messing with a Comrade! I got hold of you because I heard you saying this over there! I am a much bigger Comrade than you are! If you try to show off, using the name of the party; I'll knock your teeth out! If you have come to donate blood, do that and leave decently. Puny leader! You were a comrade? That's why you have such energy. I had thought about it. How are the activities of the Doctors' Association? Get lost! Not about me. The Doctors' Association.. Get lost, I say! He... Red Salute! He is a Comrade. I heard it. Everything? - Yes. He shouldn't have shouted at you. Why didn't you react? You noticed all that, right? - Yes. Point No.10 A politician, should not be impatient or short-tem pered. A doctor can be all that. Asocial worker should never be involved in anything that may cause damage to his body. That too, in a closed room like this. Even if we react or not, nobody is going to see it. Got it? It's politics, dude! - Why are you hitting me? Hey, the half an hour you asked for, is over. Is it? Then, we'll leave after donating the blood. Come! Wm E We will take time to identify the group & give the result. Kichu doesn't have any such problem. Any group.. I know that my group is O Negative! It's not enough if you say that! Remember that you're talking to a Comrade. Come here, dude. Nurses' association is important to us. So? Bloody has! Hello Mister! Why isn't she taking my blood? Didn't she tell you why? If she says so, you don't want my blood? If not, tell me! They take it from so many people, right? The result might take some time. So much time? They think they can do any nonsense since this is a government hospital! I know what to do! What's the use in saying all this to me? A 'Elfin Ask him directly! Good morning, Doctor. Why should I talk to the Doctor? You don't have to drag him into this. Let that innocent soul go wherever he wants. You talk to them and make things fast. See Mr. Prabhakaran uncle, why does she want to know the group? Whichever group it is, you just want the blood, right? Yes. - Then during the afternoon or night, you can check that blood group & identify it whenever you want. Right, Kichu? - Yes. In case you can't use it, you don't have to! Right, Kichu? - Yes! You can give it to some dogs or cats! Right, Kichu? Yes! Come here! Are you donating your blood, you dog? Sorry uncle. My mistake. You can pour it under some banana plant. You.. Oops. It's Kuria Sir. Did Bennychayan mess things up? Is he calling after knowing our plan? Anyway, pick up the call. We haven't done anything, right? Hello Comrade! I mean.. Sir! Krishnakumar, where are you? Sir, I am at the hospital. I'll come. Just tell me where. You're at the hospital, right? You should be there. The person who's admitted there is a Comrade who is very important to us. I came to know only now that you have gone to donate blood to him. But they said it will take some time. I'll go.. Come back" Donate blood.. And then.. Where do you want to go? You don't have any programmes today that you can't avoid, right? Yes. No! No, Sir. Then you should stay there. I'll call you later. I'm stuck here now. Actually, who is that person in the ICU? Dear, Your mom can take rest in the room if she wants to. No. It's okay. I'll sit here. We'll do one thing. Let's go freshen up and come back. You carry on. Come, mom! Com e. Did you eat anything? - Yes. I don't think she realized that we were the ones who created a ruckus earlier. Why? If she did, she would've knocked our teeth out! Will she speak so decently then? “Bheem Bheem. Chum Bheun“ It's the Circle Inspector. Comrade Krishnan? Hello Sir. I don't know! Hello? Sir! Sir told me everything. So, I'll do the needful. Sir, l... SFK's.. So where did we stop? "Bheem Bheem, Chota Bheem" Hello! Tell me, dude. Rajeev, I want to meet you. WSW I'm in the college. Or I'll come to the AC office. - No, no! We'll meet later in the night. What time? Miami a Around 11-11.30? Okay, fine. I'll call you later & tell you where to come. - Okay. - Will he come? Of course! Come! Why don't they have WiFi in a government hospital? All this is normal. There is nothing to worry. She? Oh God! Who is it? Doctor? I showed that to the doctor. Do you know this grandpa? Aishwarya! Krishnakumar? How come you're here? For a responsible social worker, a hospital is like his mother's house. Oh! ls your mother's house close by? Leave that. What are you doing here? - I am a nurse here. Is it? - Yes. It's been a long time since we met. Hows your social work going? Oh! You remember all that? - Of course! I had stopped it in between, but I'm active again now. He stopped it when he failed 12th grade. This is Mahesh. My friend. A small-time worker of SFK. I'm the District Joint Secretary. You know, right? I saw your name in the newspaper some time back. You did? Oh! You read every line of the newspaper, is it? He's the comedian of SFK as well! Well, how come only you're not wearing a uniform here? Is it because you can do anything in a government hospital? I'm on leave today. Someone who's very dear to me is in the ICU. I came to meet them. The people whom you were talking to.. A Comrade, right? Yes. You know him? What a question! I came here to donate blood for that Comrade. How do you know him? Well.. If you ask me howl know him.. He is.. He is everything for me. He made me study nursing. - You mean nursing teacher? No. This guy! Krishnan Achan is like a God to me. He paid for my education" What is his name? Krishnan. Comrade Krishnan. Krishnan! Like you, he was also a great political worker. Like me? Yes. A great man with a lot of virtue; who has helped so many people. You're doing something great. Donating blood to save Krishnan Achan's life; You will always have our love and prayers. Thanks. Thank you so much. Okay. I'll just go there. What is this? Earlier, a doctor shouted at you for no reason; and now this girl is crying for no reason. Did we ask anything so serious? We just asked what his name was; they just have to say that, right Kichu? I realised only now. Your name and his name are similar. Comrade Krishnan. Comrade Krishnakumar. Krishnan - Krishnakumar. Krishnakumar - Krishnan. Kri - Kri! Didn't you hear what she said? He was like me it seems. I don't think you both have any similarity. Elam? Come here! - Why? Let me give you some love! They are saying that they will take the blood only in the afternoon. Then you should be doing the formalities at least. It's because I don't know what the formalities are. Tell me whatever you want me to do. Don't put too much ice, brother. Its a Why aren't there seeds in it? It doesn't have any. That's all! It's because this is a part of it. - He told me. Actually, most people pay money to get such rare groups. Yes. - But we are not like that. He is a Comrade. I am a Comrade. I like helping others. That's all! Avinue.. Hey! I'll be right back. I'll also come. - No. You wait here. Or go back inside. I'll come. He asked me to wait here because he fears that you would disappear like earlier. Why aren't you moving? Kunji! Who is calling you, grandpa? Check it. It must be urgent. Well, since it is a hospital. - Or else, you would've... Picked it up? What kind of a man are you? Did you forget that you used to keep calling me on this same phone until a month back? Havel ever ignored your calls then? - But son.. It's always like that. You just wanted me until you got what you wanted. And, how is your daughter's job going on? Is a job at the co-operative bank, such a small feat? Son, I had kept the money aside for you. But that's when she.. You'll have a 100 excuses for all that. Afterl fell on so many people's feet and got her the job; I'm out! I had given Rs.25,000 to Sukumaran Sir. So? It's true that Sukumaran Sir got her the job. And you have to pay him his commission. But you promised me that you'll give me Rs.5000 for introducing you to him! And now you're making excuses saying that you paid him, she's sick & so on? Is it not valuable because it's a small amount? It's not like that. Sukumaran Sir is not alone on the director board. There won't be much time before she loses the job. Mind it! No, son. Don't say that! I have Rs.2000 with me. I had kept it aside for medicines. You can take it. Emotional blackmail! No! I don't need it! You will curse me for this and then... No. I'm giving this to you happily. This won't make up for even the phone calls I made back then. I'll pay the rest when she gets her salary. Whatever! - How are you? - This is why I don't help anyone. Continue the medicines we have been giving her. Move, grandpa. Grandma, How are you now? Are you feeling better? Get well soon. Isn't she your grand-daughter? Hi dear.. - Do you want this uncle's blood? Okay then. I'll call you on the 1st of next month. My Em You didn't curse me, rig ht? - No. That's good. And then? - Hey! Hey! - Really? I'll come later. Where were you? Nothing. I had to give someone some money. I made a small inquiry. This Comrade Krishnan was quite a tiger! Ya right! Tiger! Maxim um a State Committee Member. What more can he be? He wasn't an MLA or MP, right? He was brought here with Kuria Sir's help. That means, the highest position he could reach would be an Area Secretary. Dude! Dude! Kichu! Dude. What just happened here? What happened to you? Usually you barge in when you see state leaders, right? I don't understand anything. I'm sure about one thing. What you found out is true to an extent. The person who's lying inside, is not any ordinary man, unlike what I had imagined. The surgery would be in the afternoon, right? Yes. You had told me earlier. Even if it's in the night, I will be around. It's the matter of his life, right? The one who's inside; the Comrade; All are saying that he is a great man. The girl who came earlier, Aishwarya. She studied with me in school. She also told me. And, all the Comrades who came earlier. Just out of a curiosity to know more about him. Just for a curiosity, uncle. I am not in a state of mind to talk to you right now. Whoever he is; He is done for, anyway! He is in the ICU, right? Knowing about him won't be of any use to us. That's true. But still, who is he? Hey. You do something. Get into the ICU somehow. And then ask him directly. The surgery is only in the afternoon. You have a lot of time. Get lost! It's Rajeev. Hello Rajeev. Ya dude. We shall meet at Market Junction. No. I will wait at Market Junction. And from there, we can go to the party office together. I will call you. I'll let you know. Okay. What happened? I have to get rid of him today. What all do we have to do to survive! Did you ask seriously? What? - About Com rad e? Yes. Comrade always used to say; 'It's not when we feel like it' 'But when people need it, that we should do the things that they ask you to do' Not just because of that; Everyone should know about Comrade. Especially you. Because, Comrade was always like a textbook to me. A huge book, from which I could learn a lot, and also emulate a lot from. Your name is Krishnakumar, right? Yes. When I heard you talking earlier, I was reminded of our Comrade. He was also like you. A politician who was always busy. Actually, it would be better to call him a social worker, or a public servant; rather than a politician. Certain glances and talks of yours; felt exactly like those of Comrade's. He was my closest friend. I was in the Police. I met Comrade for the first time.. At Peerum ed u. I was a Sub-Inspector there, back then. Comrade was a worker who had come there to develop the Communist Party. Back then, he would've been of your age. But. He had maturity beyond his age; eyes that exuded confidence; the spirit of revolution all over his mind and body. He came onto the chilly Peerumedu, like a wildfire. - Don't hit me, Sir. - Shut up! I didn't do it, Sir. Get in, I say. It's not me, Sir. I didn't do it. Don't hit me, Sir. Put him into the jeep! I didn't do it, Sir. Don't take me, Sir. I am innocent. - Shut up! Don't take me, Sir. Don't hit me, Sir. One Sod a. Why was he beaten up so brutally? You're new here, right? If the Policeman Eerali wants to torture someone, he doesn't even need a reason! This is usual here. Where are you from? I haven't seen you here earlier. You will see me from now on, everyday. For the time being, this is our party office. You can stay here as well. It has all the basic facilities. Come in. Eldo! Shall we talk? Come. I don't think I have to introduce Comrade Krishnan any further. This is Comrade Dasan. Comrade Senthil. That's Comrade Basheer. This is Comrade Eldo. Comrades, to make the activities of Communist Party more powerful over here, Comrade Krishnan was appointed by the Kottayam District Committee. Comrade will tell you more details himself. After that, we can discuss. I invite Comrade to speak. But. Let the others also come. Well.. Comrade, In Peerumedu, the red colour isn't that strong yet. Only five of us are here as Party members now. What about the workers' union? There is a union. Just for namesake. Firstly, the workers here are unorganized. The union and party are supposed to bring together the unorganized workers. Well, for the party to be involved properly... Which is that book you have with you? Karl Marx: A new age leader. Written by Comrade EMS. Apart from conceptual ideologies, the party needs a place, to converse and interact with the people, like Comrade mentioned earlier. That place which we don't see, know or understand; is inside their minds! The first thing that a Communist should understand, is not about the worker's job or wage or working place; it is his mind! His mind which has thoughts about his family, job, difficulties and anxieties; and his happiness and sorrows. That's where we should plant the seeds of communist ideologies. The party's growth should be along with his realizations. It's uproar should resonate from the minds of each worker who belongs to the lower class of this society. The slogan, 'Long Live The Revolution' should be infused in his nerves from there! We have limitations to what we can do, Comrade. There are many reasons for that as well. There are no limitations to the things that a Communist can do! In the beginning of 1940s, when the Communist Party formed in Kerala through a wall scrawl, at Karivalloor, Morayur, Kavumbayi in Malabar; when revolts broke out under the leadership of Communist Party and Peasants' Union, when Comrades Keeleri Kunjikkannan, Pulava Kumaran, and Pulikkal Kunjiraman became martyrs; the party had to face much bigger limitations, difficulties and obstacles. For every Communist who was depressed by all this, it was the workers' minds that gave them the energy that they needed. And the trust they have in our Party. It was that trust which brought the EMS ministry to power in 1957. We can do it! We should do it, Comrade. 10 years back, Mehta from Bombay; bought 3 estates including this one from the British Company called Morrison. Elappara, Kallarkudi, Peerumed u. Out of these three, the biggest one and the one where most people are working, is in this estate. This manager has been here only for 3 years now. But his cruelties are unbearable. Why isn't anyone reacting then? They are scared! Don't look at me. All of us are scared! He has a right-hand man, Garudan! Garudan Kangani. Hey! Come here. Why didn't you come for work yesterday? It was my child's admission day in school. And did your child learn anything? I will teach her. Shall I? No. I will come everyday hereafter. Then, you should learn something. To run! Run! He has been here for some years now. He came from Coorg. Kangani is the one who sends workers to the Company. He distributes the money that the company gives him, to the workers, as he pleases. No one raises any objection. Can't you complain to the Police? To whom? To Eerali? - Why didn't you do it? What's up, Garudan? Greetings! - How are things? In such a situation, how can we strengthen the Party? The Union is not able to do anything worthwhile. Even we are staying here as Communists ready to face whatever comes our way. Do you know the meaning of the word 'Union'? Association. To be associated. Or to come together. If workers don't come to the Union, the Union should reach out to the workers. Here, conceptual ideologies are not enough. We need practical activism as well. In 1951, Central Government passed a bill here. Do you know what that is? Indian Plantation LabourAct. For the welfare and job security of the labourers who're working in plantations, Company Act came into force. The plantations which are spread over 15 acres or above, and where 15 or more labourers are working, come within the limits of Major Plantations Company Act. According to that, the labourers working in such plantations, are eligible for direct salary and other concessions from the Company. How many of you, are getting salary directly from the Company & not through Kangani? Leave that. The concessions entitled to a labourer by law; How many of you receive them? Concessions? Provident Fund, which is supposed to be paid equally by the labourer &the Company. Bonus, which is a share from the total profit. Gratuity, Increment; And, paid and unpaid sick leaves and casual leaves.. Any such things? Sir, what are you talking about? About you! About labourers including Muthu, Mani, Selvan, Raghavan, Nalini and many others! You, who haven't even heard such things; how many years have you been working for a company like slaves? The Company that you helped grow, with your sweat & blood; is exploiting you! Even though you work throughout the year, the working class is always in poverty and starvation; is because of this exploitation! They are building forts of exploitation over your ignorance and fear. Company is not our enemy. We are not against the Company either. But we have to fight for labourers' rights that they deserve. How'? For that we need a Workers' Union here. And it should be strong too! Most of the workers are ready to support us. What's the next action plan? We should talk. We should talk to the management. We should make them realize the situations. What are you saying, Comrade? Do you think they will accept all this as soon as we talk? Never! But neither they or us should feel that, an opportunity to discuss was lost. We want to meet the manager. What's the matter? We want to talk to him. If you come all of a sudden, how can you meet him? You should get a prior appointment, rig ht? We'll meet him once we get permission. You can't get that so soon. Manager Sir is busy with a lot of things. Just tell him, that the representatives of the Workers' Union have come to meet him. You can't meet him now. He is busy. It's all right. We will wait until he becomes free. Didn't I tell you earlier? This is not going to happen. Since we didn't get an opportunity to talk.. If we have decided to talk, we will definitely talk. But we should get permission to meet the manager, right? We already got it. The time we waited today, will be our permission for tomorrow. Where are you going? Sit down. These chairs are for us to sit. What do you want? It's okay. It's because you heard things which are unfamiliar to you, all of a sudden. The workers are demanding only their basic rights. You will have to accept that sooner or later. Think about it. Did you think that I'm going to give it as soon as you ask for it? Yes. I believe so. Even the sun cannot keep the world in darkness, more than a night. There will be light. There are around 3000 labourers here. And their families and helpers, etc. If we call for a strike, I don't know how many of them would support us. Among them, there are people who work for other unions as well. Majority of them have accepted this way of life. Until they realize that a better life is possible here, they will adjust to any situation. That's ignorance. Our job is to make them aware of their rights. And, the strike. Even if we have just one person who supports us whole-heartedly! That one person can make this strike successful! Communist ideology is like fire. Even if it is on a match-stick, the exploitative bourgeois class will be scared. They should be scared. Because, to burn down a forest, a spark is more than enough. I don't understand why we have to think so much. Is he our new adversary? Well, let's see how far he goes, Garudan! Here he comes. You remove all those chairs from there. I want to see how he's going to sit and talk to me. Sir, They.. Come in, Comrade. Sit down. You came to sit down and discuss, right? Come. Let's discuss. I'm not going to accept your demands in any case. But we shouldn't refrain from discussing because of that. Sit down. Sit! If I have decided that I will sit &talk, I will always sit and talk! - Hey! - Don't move! And, if you don't realize what the workers' rights are: you are yet to realize, the strength of the workers, and how powerful they are! Long Live The Revolution! Long Live the Workers' Union! What is this? Loo k! - Long Live The Revolution! Move! Move, I say! Long Live The Revolution! Long Live The Workers' Union! You shouldn't gather in front of the company, breaking law & order; shout slogans, or interrupt the Company's functioning. So, all of you should disperse from here immediately. Or else, we will have to use force to send you away! Long Live The Revolution! You should disperse. Long Live The Revolution! Charge! Long Live The Workers' Union! Long Live The Workers' Union! Move! Move, I say! Don't spare any of them! You & your Communism! Get in! Close it! You don't have to take them to the station rig ht now. You &your strike! Bloody Comrade! Sir, he will die if you hit him like this. Die? This guy? Long Live The Revolution! Long Live The Workers' Union! Stop it. They hurt you a lot, is it? Let's go to Kottayam. You will be all right if you take rest for some days. To continue the rest of the activities, we have other comrades here. No, Comrade. Before this issue dies down, we have to go forward with other forms of protests. I should be here for that. And it's not my pain which should be relieved first, it's their stand towards the working class that should be changed. This is Rajan Sir. - Hello. He is the assistant labour officer here. He is an old Comrade. There is no change in that. And the only relief I get when I'm called an old Comrade, is that old is supposed to be gold! Comrades, our protests should be stronger from now on. The Company should realize that they have no other option, other than accepting the fair demands of workers. The next generation should learn from this land that, police brutalities cannot put and end to the workers' blood! Long Live The Revolution! Long Live The Workers' Union! Long Live The Revolution! Long Live The Revolution! They would do anything to transport the goods during the night. So at least some of us should be awake. Comrade! What happened? - Over there! That Kangani! There were four or five of them. They didn't spare even the children. They might be trying to scare them when the men of the house are not around. Did you get scared, dear? Why should we be scared? Kangani is the one who should be scared! Who is it? Who is it? Who the hell is it? Garudan! Who is it? If a group of people are not working according to your whims and fancies, is it right to force those whims and fancies upon them, Garudan? Who are you? If you do so, do you think a Communist would stay calm? Stop hiding in the dark and come to the light. It's not me. You are the one who is in the dark! You forgot a major fact, Garudan! That you are also a worker! May this remind you about that! "In the heart... a fire rises ablaze" "and spreads beyond time" "The pulsating red of the new age has united us for our land" "At the places we gather" "With the hands that rise" "We shall hold our red flag high for a better tomorrow“ "Hereafter, when there's a war cry on our streets" "We will give our lives to stop it" "In these dark ages" "In the burning heat of oppression" "We shall become the comforting shade" "We will beat their words with our glances" "We will fight a battle if we have to" "Let us join hands" "And may the skies resonate with the uproars of revolution" "At the places we gather" "With the hands that rise" "We shall hold our red flag high for a better tomorrow“ How many of you are there? - We are out of work now, Comrade. Kavalam Pattar. Kavalam Pattar. He is a famous landlord here. In this high range, where only tea and spices are grown; he came from Kavalam & started cultivating paddy. Since he was reluctant to pay Rs.6 as wages to the poor peasants in town; he has brought Tamilians to work, from Kam bam & Theni; who would work for 4 or 5 Rupees. Since a peasants' union does not exist here, my opinion is that the Party &the Workers' Union should act upon this. Awage of 5 Rupees. 1/12th of the profit. Let them work! That's not fair, Pattar. Awage of 8 Rupees. 1/10th of the profit. Then you better get going before it becomes too sunny. You know that we didn't come here to stay! Let's settle the scores on the field! What is your name? Krishnan! - Krishnan! Just Krishnan? Don't you have any 'tail' along with your name? Like Krishnan Namboothiri or Krishnan Nair? Or is it something else? If you want to know about my caste and faith, they are not a 'tail' to my name. It comes before my name. Comrade! Comrade Krishnan! So, nobody should work on Pattar's fields from today, right? No. Agriculture is not like business. Each enterprise has its own methods of strike. Here, it's not like how we went on strike, by stopping work at the Company, until our demands were accepted. Until our demands are accepted, we should go on strike, by working vigorously. You shouldn't support the landlord's exploitation. You shouldn't support the landlord's exploitation. No one can stop you from working here. You can work here. Or leave. But to work on these fields, we will have peasant workers from here, as well! Not just a Workers' Union; we need a Peasants' Union as well. - Comrade, Pattar has decided that he's not going to cultivate anything this year. He sent the Tamil labourers back, asking them to stop whatever work they were doing. It's paddV- It's our food. Even if he lets go of it for a year, nothing will happen to Pat-tar. But that's not the situation of the poor people in this town. We should begin where Pattar stopped. "Time will constantly, firmly yet slowly, create history" "In it, we shall write in blood and our smiles will reflect the seasons of change" Until a decision is made about this, we should be able to supply the ration for families of peasants. "Until we see the sun rising" "We should stand guard during the nights" "Thousands will sacrifice their blood & lives" "May the skies resonate with the uproars of revolution" "At the places we gather" "In the hands that rise" "We shall hold our red flag high for a better tomorrow“ I can't agree to these conditions. There's something that you haven't understood until now. They haven't take a single grain as a wage from this yet. Oh! Who asked them to to cultivate my fields without my permission? That's why they approached me to hand over the paddy they cultivated there, to you. I shall tell you something. The peasants have taken a very decent stand. If your create any other problems because of this, you will be in trouble, as per the labour law. The peasants don't want anything illegally. It should be the same for you. - Awage of 7 Rupees. 1/10th of the profit. There's no compromise on that. It's a decision that wouldn't affect both the parties. If you agree, you can sign it. Or else, you will lose your paddy & your fields! Here! Why do you have to be so stubborn? It's of no use! Go ahead, sign it! Down there. So, that's over. Here you go. All the best then! If it boils too much, however good the rice is, it won't be edible. If it was in Kavalam, I could've drowned him in the lake, and not a single soul would know it. If you can deal with the consequences, I will make sure that there won't be any trouble from him, here in Peerumedu. Where, Muthu? It's nearby. At a time when wild boars go astray, where are you off to, Comrade? To save Rag havan, who is lying wounded in the jungle? No. Raghavan isn't wounded. And he isn't lying in the jungle. You must be thinking why I came here then. Didn't you talk about wild boars that have gone astray? I came here to trap one such wild boar. To tame him inside thejungle itself. Because, if it reaches the village, it will be troublesome for the villagers. Don't look at him. Aworkerwho's concerned about his kind, cannot betray his colleague. But he brought me here since you asked him to. That was with my knowledge. Isn't it against one's civic sense to beat up an SI in front of the public, Eerali? Even if it was because of my plan, or because of your idea, you will not return from this jungle, Comrade. Do you know what's the biggest desire of a real Communist? To become a martyr for his beliefs and his Party. Those who run and hide when they face death, would need a gun. To stand in front of a fearless Comrade. I'm not scared to die, Eerali. But I will not die at the hands of a scumbag like you! Didn't you say that he was your best friend? He ripped you apart, huh? Is he a fool? Hey! Stop m Sorry Kichu. But that was so funny! Didn't he say that they were best friends? Who will do such a thing to their friend? Sorry! - Why? Because I talked about beating up a friend. Bennychayan. Hello! Bennychayan! Tell me. I am stuck up right now. I'll do something. I'll send Mahesh there. He'll tell you what the plan is. Okay? No, Bennychayan. Mahesh will be with you. Sure. Confirm ed! Okay? Hey, you should go and meet Bennychayan. And explain our plan in detail to him. And you should wait ahead of Market Junction. I'll come along with him around 11-11.30, or, let's make it a little more late. Maxim um 12 o'clock! I will come by then. - Are you going to stay here till then? I was talking about bringing him. I will leave quickly from here. Okay. You can leave now. Shouldn't we buy some food for Bennychayan? I'll buy the food for him, myself. Okay? You get going! Come on! I should eat something, right? Even though I won't grow much, I have to grow, right? Here you go. Okay then. Bye. You will come by afternoon, rig ht? Yes. But before that, you should arrange everything. - Okay. Hey! Ask them not to hurt him much. Sorry. He.. He doesn't know how to behave. That's why. You said that he was your friend, rig ht? Then when you got beaten up? Is this scar from that day? That's true. I was a villain initially. After that fig ht, Comrade didn't see me for many days. For a really long time. I was in the hospital for 3-4 months. Then I got a transfer and went to Malappuram. Because of this fight, even Comrade had to go into hiding and then to the jail for sometime. But I realized later that it was good that I was beaten up by him. Pain is not just for certain people. The one who's inflicting it will realize it only when he gets it back. When did you becomes his friend then? Didn't I tell you? After a long time, I retired as a DYSP. After that, I settled down at Kottayam. My grand-daughter had a certain ailment. The treatment was happening here. Comrade had become the life and soul of the people of Periyar by then. Age never mattered to him. But, he suffered from a stroke in between. One side was paralyzed. And, he wasn't that old then. He had to bear a lot of beatings from goons and the police, right? After that, he didn't have the capacity to walk too much or do anything stressful. When Comrade and family shifted to Kottayam, they came to stay as my neighbours. Initially both of us felt really awkward. Gradually, there's a problem only if friends turn into foes. When foes turn into friends, it's good. So many years after that; he did everything that he could do, for his friends, relatives or siblings. What's the status, Advocate? What do I say? The registration happened without any problems. Aren't you all happy now? Thekkum para Tea Estate which was closed for several years, will have a new lease of life. The Company is going to be operational again! The one who wanted to hear this the most, is inside.. He should've been the first person to know it. This is as valuable as Com rade's life for us. I'll go tell this to Janaki. Okay. Our Company is going to start functioning again! The registration is over. The Company our Comrade gave us. "Actually, who are you, Comrade?" "I know something for sure." "What I heard until now was nothing" "There's much more to hear" "Right?" "Comrade Krishnan!" "Red Salute!" Have you had any diseases earlier? Of course! Not that. Any contagious diseases like jaundice? No. Are you having any medicines right now? No. Have you taken any anti-biotics in the past 3 days? Have you been anywhere outside Kerala? No. - Recently? Not as far as I know. I had taken a hot water bath two weeks ago. Just for a change. Is that a problem? Sign here! Show this at that counter. You scared me. - What? I've come to donate blood. They are all here for that. Just wait. Where were you? I was at the blood bank to donate blood. I would've come with you. - That's okay. Did you donate the blood? No. It's really crowded. So I thought I'll wait outside. It's always like this here. They are understaffed. If you go outside, what if more people come? No. I have kept a towel on the seat. Come. Let's eat something then. No. I'm not hungry. Why? Don't you want nutritious food for lunch? Not that. I'm not hungry right now. That's why. Okay. Let me know when you are hungry. Okay. Yes, Mahesh - Hello Kichu! Bennychayan was saying that he will hit you using 'Paulytechnique' What? My phone's running out of charge. Just a second. What was that thing called? That was pauly... poly.. Get lost! Go to hell! What was that thing called? The thing that's used to make rods for movies? Polyform! If we make a rod using polyform, it will seem really original. You won't get hurt. - Will I get beaten up? Dude, it's something likethermocol. Hello? His phone would've run out of charge. Anyway, let's get it mad e. Point No.3 Three horns of a rabbit. Those horns are politician's horns! Oh, you woke up? This is Krishnakumar. He came to donate blood. Yes. We saw him. He was my senior in school. He is a major students' leader. I heard him saying that. Nothing like that. Why are you shy about it? Only a person who is aware of his country, will have political awareness. I am SFK's district joint secretary. Let me know if you need anything. You want some tea? - No. Niyathi Chechi was also actively involved in politics while studying in JNU. Many girls are joining here as well. Were you an office-bearer? Yes. I was a central committee mem ber. Once I finished my PG, I quit. It's good. Being a central committee member, is really good. Give me your phone. Don't you want to charge it? Oh. Why do you want to know more about dad? Are you planning to write any novel on him? Not that. The morel know about him.. He is like that. As you get closer to him, you feel as if there is much more to learn about him. Actually, his life has enough content for a novel. Pack one of them. - Okay. Just rice? We have Biriyani, Sir. No. I will have rice. We have chicken biriyani with egg, Sir. I can give you two extra eggs. No. - Where is the other guy? Just check the coupon & bring the food. If you don't want it, fine. What will I get by serving Biriyani for you? How a father should be like, for a daughter; My dad was like that to me. He never tried to control me; or took decisions for me. But each and every decision of mine, had my father's influence on them. While I was studying in 7th grade, there was a strike in our school. Something related to free lunch for students. I didn't try to find who was behind the strike. But I went ahead and joined the strike. Usually girls go nowhere near a strike. Not just girls, even boys were just peeping out of the window. While studying in 7th or 8th, we would just be curious about all this. I also went ahead, shouting slogans! And that was it! The school headmistress caught me. She asked me to enter class only after bringing my father. Back then, I used to see dad only once or twice in a month. I was scared that my parents would scold me if they know about this. To be frank, I had expected a dialogue from dad on that day; "It's good that you took pan in a strike" "But when it's time for you to study, you should be doing that" I told my mom about it. Next day when I went to school, my friends told me that my dad was in the office. You might be very active in politics. But do you want to drag your daughter into politics at such a young age? Let the kids study well. Don't you want them to study, and get a job in the future? Their behaviour in school will depend upon how their parents have raised them. You should promise me that such incidents won't happen hereafter. You don't have to scold or beat her for this. What is it? Nothing. I knew that you will support your child. Everything that you said is right, teacher. You can only think in that way. But don't mistake it to be the truth for me, anyone else, or the entire world. To play around, politics is not a ball game; To be dragged into, it is not a swamp or filth infested by worms. Politics. Age or lineage is never an issue for that, teacher. From the second we are born, we are a pan of politics. When children use pens with blue and black inks, don't you correct them using red ink? Isn't that politics? Even this green ink pen which you use to attest documents, isn't it a pan of politics? If you use black or blue for that, it won't have any value, teacher. If the ink of a pen can be political, why can't a 7th grade student be political? My daughter. She is an individual. She did something which she felt was rig ht. Not just my daughter; All the other children who participated in that strike too. You can't say that it is totally unfair. Each student here should not be coming to the school to study, just to secure a job in the future. Didn't I tell you earlier? They should have the ability to differentiate between such rights and wrongs, by the time they complete their schooling. The jobs they do will not be important. How they are doing it, would be more important. For that, this ability is necessary for them. In these short lives of ours, the highest education we should be getting; should be about choice. It should be about wisdom. It should be about the sense on how we have to live our lives. Dad never taught me how to live my life. But he showed me how to. He lived his life and taught me through that. Comrade Krishnan wasn't just a good Comrade, he was a great father as well. The best father ever! Hello! Look who's here! When did you come? Around 15 minutes back. Is it? Where is Sudha Chechi? - In the room. This is Prabhakaran Sir's granddaughter, Sreekala. She has a slight mental retardation. Not like that. Differently abled. Rig ht, S reekutty? - Yes. Sreekala sings very well, draws well. Come. Let's go to the room. Aren't you coming? - No. If you have eaten food, we can take blood only after 2 hours. What kind of a rule is that? - That's how it is here. Who asked you to leave earlier? Well.. That.. Come after an hour. Are you doing this deliberately? What? Nothing! The police came home for an inquiry. I said I don't know anything. What have you told them? We didn't say anything clearly. - What is it, Krishnakumar? My mobile phone.. - Oh. I'll get it. - No. I'll take it. I'll sit outside the ICU. What if they need something? Sit here, aunty. Everyone else is over there. Very nice. She stayed away from there at least for some time, only today. The surgery will be in the afternoon, right? You don't have to wait there already, right? This is nothing! That's true. If dad leaves for something important, Sud ha Chechi, Long back, dad went off to Kumali once. For 60 days. He came back after exactly 60 days. Two months? - Yes. He met an old friend of his when he went to Kumali. A doctor. He took him along with him. Not to have fun; When he saw him, dad was looking really sick. He brought him here directly. When they did tests, he had a very bad case of ulcer. He never used to have food on time. Or.. You never cooked for him or what? Stop kidding! - Then? Then what? Compulsory treatment for 60 days, completely free. After the treatment, he gave dad his travel fare and sent him back. Two months? Didn't anyone go looking for him when he didn't come back? Great! My dear Krishnakumar, that was not my dad's first disappearance. Why go further? Even their wedding was a great comedy. Comedy? Ya. You should listen to this story. You want to know more about dad, right? Comrade Krishnan had a different side to him. What's that? Tell him, mom. That would be better. What's wrong with you? I was about to ask you. In between his political activities, did he have time for his family? For Comrade, his Party and his family were equally important. He made sure that we never faced any difficulty. He was the best husband; and father. Tell him about your wedding, mom. About our wedding.. Working with Comrade was like, an addiction. For all of us. Not just strikes and protests; There was music, plays and much more; "Behold! Someone has risen up in the sky, crossing the mountains" "He adorned this yearning earth with his light" "In these misty mountains, our dreams have finally come alive" "Comrade" "Over the rivers and shores, as far as our eyes can see" "The golden Sun is spreading rays of happiness" "Over the rivers and shores, as far as our eyes can see" "The golden Sun is spreading rays of happiness" Due to many misunderstandings and ignorance, your lives were made really difficult. But you can do a lot of things here. You should do it! This age demands a wind of change. "In the valleys where pine-trees grow“ "The playful winds gave us a fresh, cool breeze" "While sun-rays caress them with their gentle touch" "The dewdrops on the flowers spread light like pearls" "Comrade" There are some more people. I'll drop them and come back. Comrade Janaki is an asset to our Party. Where is Comrade Janaki? I didn't see her. She hasn't come. Don't feel bad, Comrade. She won't be coming from now on. I'm asking you the reason for that. Since she is working for the Party and the Union, two marriage proposals that came for her, didn't happen. We will always be with the Union. But don't force Janaki to come for any of the activities. So that was it. Not just Janaki, I have never forced anyone to do anything. But just because of this reason, don't confine such a talented girl in your house. Have you ever felt that she is doing something wrong? No. There are many more things that Comrade Janaki has to achieve. Shouldn't you be proud of your daughter? Yes. That's what I'm saying. The farmers' strike is about to begin in Kumali. Mm a Shall we leave? - But Comrade, What about her wedding then? Her wedding will happen at the right time. You can say that. But what about her future? If no one marries her, I will marry her. Okay? I'll see you at tomorrow's meeting. Shall I go? - Okay. "The breeze awakened the flower which had forgotten to bloom" "Lining the eyes with sun-rays" "The inner eyes were shown the light of wisdom" "The little bird sang songs to awaken us and flew high" "Peerumedu has woken up to a new red dawn" "Comrade" Haven't you slept, Comrade? Basheer'? What is it? At this hour? Well.. You wouldn't have remembered in between your busy schedule. But they are worried. Who? Janaki. Since you haven't decided anything about her after that.. It's been a year. You mean Comrade Janaki? What about her? You had agreed to marry her, right? It was a mistake which slipped out of my mouth unknowingly. But I haven't come here to justify it or run away from it. Even though it was unintentional, I have caused such a grief for you. To get rid of that, if I have to marry Janaki, I am ready for that. You can think over it and let me know. What is it, Comrade? Comrade, even though you had mentioned such a thing that day; you have never behaved like that to me. I shall talk to my parents. You don't have to be in a relationship that you're not interested in. Unlike what you think, I didn't say no to this wedding because I don't like it or to live with someone else. Not just you“. I have never felt attracted to any woman in this world. The Party is everything for me. I let go of my family, to become a full time party activist. But this wedding.. It should happen. I know that I can never be a good husband. Not even a good father or a family man. Even if my wife Janaki may not be able to understand that, I believe that Comrade Janaki would understand that. You've asked for vessels, right? You should finish all the work by today. Two big vessels; Why do we need all this, Comrade? This is not just a wedding in the Party for us. It is a festival for this village. It's his wedding tomorrow Where is he going? Don't just sit here. Come out. Sit here, my dear. Where is Comrade? He will come soon. Calm down. Where is Comrade? Did something happen to him? Or did he cheat us? Comrade was not at all interested in this wedding. People have started talking. Did he tell you anything? Okay. Shall we eat something at least now? It's 3 PM. Com e. You don't have to reach back urgently, rig ht? He's here. Comrade! What happened, Comrade? The discussion went on for a long time. It's true that he forgot about the wedding because of the discussion. Did you think that I left the town cheating you? If I thought so, I wouldn't have waited here for you, for so long. "Oh my honey" "You are so beautiful" "Howjoyous, is this beginning" "Full of love" "Oh my honey" "You are so beautiful" "I see you all the time" "Even when you are away, you will still be in my eyes" "Even when I cannot see the naughtiness in your eyes" "A thousand flowers are blooming" "And my heart is overjoyed" "And the sweetest feeling is when I can feel what is in your heart" "Oh my honey" "You are so beautiful" "Oh my honey" "You are so beautiful" "Howjoyous, is this beginning" "Full of love" Get that flag! It's not just because of the promise I made, To hold the flag along with me during a strike, To chant slogans until our last breath, To keep ourselves warm by the fire, in this cold weather of Periyar, To hold my hand and walk with me when I am tired, I think you can do all that, Comrade. I think only you can do all that, Comrade. "My sweetheart" "You should march along with me, holding my hands" "Beyond the limits of time" "On our way forward" Done with your work? - Here you go. What is this? - My wage. Comrade, it's your wage. It belongs to you. "My heart is overjoyed" "And the sweetest feeling is when I can feel what is in your heart" "Oh my honey" "You are so beautiful" "Oh my honey" "You are so beautiful" "Howjoyous, is this beginning" "Full of love" Keep this. Keep this. What is this for? We give this usually. Can I leave now? No. Lie down for some time. We're not supposed to leave you quickly. Thank you so much! For what? You donated blood for our Comrade, right? We are indebted to you! Donating blood is not a debt. Everyone does it. Not just that. They would've taken the blood for Comrade already. I am just replacing it. Each and every thing that is done for Comrade, is important to us. Until we die, it will remain so. Comrade is.. Special to me also now. Like someone very close to me. I wanted to know one more thing. Actually, what happened to him? What is this surgery for? I noticed that the police had come for an inquiry earlier. If you don't want to say it.. Comrade has some health issues! A minor surgery to treat that. That's what we have told everyone. He was the one who was particular that, people should know only that much. Comrade, "My life is a protest in itself" "A protest for my fellow human beings" "A protest for the right to live" Dad, Sit down. What did the Doctor say? As usual, to continue the medicines for blood pressure. Everything else is normal. Were you able to meet the physiotherapist? No. He is on leave today. It's okay. I will meet him tomorrow. _ Dad! Call for you! Activism is a good thing. To get justice for a girl who has been raped, Or to arrest the teacher who molested his student, You can do all that, right? Instead, if you go behind these ones, you won't even get media attention. And this is a routine for them. Loo k! Do they have any shame, even though they are in a police station? You better go now. If there's something with news value, I will let you know. What are you going to do with them? I can't eat them up, rig ht? Can't say since it is you, Sir. That's why I asked. I will register a case and present them before the court. What about the men who were caught along with them? A woman cannot do immoral trafficking by herself, rig ht? They“ They would also be presented before the court. I'm sure, Sir. There's no such person in this station rig ht now. Even if they are here, they will escape from this mess, by getting bail or through bribes before they reach the court. Didn't you say earlier? About getting justice for girls who are raped? In many families, including yours; women can walk around peacefully without the fear of rape, at least to a certain extent; because such women are here to fulfill the perversions of men. You will arrest them out of excitement. Court will send them to rescue shelters orjails. And then? Does prostitution end with that? You can only harass these poor women. The same thing happens here in five star facilities too. Can you even dare to touch them? I want to take them away from here. I can't do that without your permission. But you have to give me permission. Are you ordering me? Bloody... Even if I slap an SI for using foul language to a woman, there would be enough and more news value, Sir. Hope you can understand. I can promise you one thing. You can see at least some of them, making a living through a different profession in the near future. You can take them to LIFE foundation. I have to collect my dad's blood test results. I will get it and come there. All of you take some rest first. We'll talk after that. Maya! I made a mistake, Comrade. We didn't have any other option. It has been 8 years since the Company was shut. Everyone are out of work. All the young people, left the hills looking for otherjobs. Many went to Kam bam & Theni leaving everything behind. And there are many of us, remaining there. We had no idea what to do. We are starving. Terribly starving. Dear.. It's because we didn't have any other option" Your condition back then was.. Dear It was my mistake. I didn't know anything. I didn't bother to find out. It has been around 10-15 years.. Since I climbed that misty mountain. In. I have to go there. Aren't you going to bed? Periyar has changed a lot. Now that change should happen in the lives of the people here. Who are you? - Is Mathew Sir here? Dad is sleeping. What's the matter? We want to meet him. He will wake up only around four - four thirty. You can either wait here or come back later in the evening. Then we shall wait here. No. Let's come back in the evening. That will be better. Then we will come in the evening. When Sir wakes up, tell him that Comrade Krishnan had come to meet him. Okay. I'll tell him. Mathew Sir will be able to do it. In the present situation, only he can do something about it. Sorry. Papa asked me to take you back immediately. You have avoided a huge loss which could've happened to me, due to an unnecessary misunderstanding. If you are in need of something, whenever it is; Don't hesitate to ask me. Thank you for your kindness, Sir. And, I hope such a situation never arises. I was sure that, you would never come asking for my help, for yourself, Comrade. This is something I want for myself as well. It's the necessity of a village, of which I am also a pan of. Comrade, I can understand what you are saying. But, to buy an entire plantation... Firstly, the plantation industry is not profitable now, Moreover, it is in a huge loss as well. You know it, right? Then there are cases, arguments, workers' issues, etc. Now, my children look after everything. Let me think about it. If he gets a good buyer, Mehta is ready to sell the estate. Even they would've felt that, it would be better to sell it, than letting it go to ruins. So no such buyer has come until now? Many came and went back. Some of them were almost about to get the registration done. But it didn't happen. Comrade, don't worry. Let's see. There are other people as well, right? Or else, we can request Mehta to reopen it himself. I am not sad. I feel angry towards myself. I have shouted many slogans for and against that Company. I can't let it ruin. We thought about it and made a decision. Job's group is ready to buy Thekkum para tea estate. We are not just buying it; We will also reopen the company and start work there. People who lost their jobs will get them back. Sir.. I don't know what to say. But I have a small condition. It's not such a big deal. Since we are spending so much money, on a field which is not familiar to us, and the place is also new to us. When the Company starts functioning again, you should be there, as a representative of the Company. I know about your health issues. I am also getting old. Just a fear. The Company shouldn't close down because of yet another workers' issue. For that, you should be there, Comrade. As the Company's man. Think about it. Think about it and let me know what you decide. There is nothing to think about. I will be there. As the Company's man. For the workers. The Doctor had warned you, rig ht? Isn't it really cold there? At least, he was slightly younger back then. I will talk to Mathew Sir. You can stay here and look after the things there, right? If Mathew Sir is is willing to buy the estate without any second thoughts, that's a great thing. And his only demand was that I should be there. If people are still calling me 'Comrade'; be it a boss or a worker; it is because of their belief in our Party. Their belief that there will always be a Comrade to help them. Krishnan, the individual is not important here. But it is Krishnan, the Communist. It's not just as a help for them. It is my necessity, that I should be there. For that, I must stay there. Com rad e, Periyar's cold weather can never defeat, the heat of a communist's blood! Till there, it's 8 acres according to the old records. And after that? I have received some threatening calls. Okay. I'll do it. Okay. It was Sanjay from Bombay. They received some blackmail calls regarding the sale of the estate. These are all random excuses! They are not random. I don't think so! Not just that. Since we have come so far, they don't have any reason to lie to us. There is something" I didn't want to tell this to you. Even I received such threats. About the after effects if I buy the estate. Some even said that they will finish me! We've heard much more, right Comrade? But this is a good thing that is going to happen, right? Who has a problem with that? - Excuse me! Do you have a light? Match box? Sorry. None of us smoke. Oh. It's okay. Hello Comrade. There's a small problem. I would like to meet you. From what the documents show, 4 acres are less. The survey was done dividing the property into 3 pans. The area that you see there is included in that. The area which is missing is in Pan C. You are not supposed to desire things that don't belong to you. Even if it is a needle. Tony, you wished for it and took it as well. We want it back. I don't understand what you are saying! Son, to understand what I'm saying, you need to see a lot more of the world around you. At Thekkum para estate, which has been defunct for the past 8 years, an encroachment happened two years back. On the company's property which was rendered useless, there are two resorts operating now. As pan of the sale of that property, the Company wants that land back. Why are you saying all this to me? Those resorts are owned by a certain Tony Manakkal. When I made an inquiry, I got to know that it's you. However many fake documents you try to forge; You are not going to get that property. Legally, you can't sell that much land as well. I can think of only one solution for this. Demolish those resorts! If you do it yourself, you might get a compensation from them. So you want me to demolish it? That's awesome! I'll definitely demolish it! You better leave right now! It was my duty to inform you about this. And it is your duty to do it. This might be the first time in the world, that someone has asked a thief to return a stolen property so decently. I expect the same decency from you too. I don't understand why we have to beg him for this! Let's just go ahead and demolish it! We don't have to do anything in a hurry. Let's see if he is going to do it himself. Either he is not going to take this seriously, or he may get a stay from court against demolishing the resort. But I don't think that he is going to demolish it by himself, as you think. The kids these days, Prabhakaran Sir. We can never predict what they will do. Oh, is that you, Comrade? I didn't know. Have you been waiting for me here for a long time? Whatever it is, let's talk about it tomorrow. Move your Jeep. Comrade, my Jeep has a problem. It has a problem if someone comes in its way. That's because you're looking from that jeep alone. If you look from here, it's your jeep that is in my way. I wanted to meet you. Speak of the devil and he appears! Even if this Company comes up or not, how would it affect you? To be frank, if it was a personal problem of yours, I would have demolished it already! But now, I have spent a lot of money on it. And now, it's doing well also. It's true that I made a mistake back then. I didn't care that it belonged to someone else. Now, sincel have invested so much on it; it would be difficult to demolish it now. Not just what you did back then; What you're doing today is also a mistake, Tony. Yes. It's a mistake. It's because I can't help it. You should help me out. Offering money to you, would make me a typical villain. That's why I asked for it as a favour. If you stay here, it will be a problem for everyone. Even for you! So, shall we pan ways happily? Take your hand off, Tony! Take it off! Stan the car! I know very well that they are not going to buy this Company, if you are no more. I don't have any other option. You can only kill the person called Krishnan. But you can never kill the Comrade! This didn't start with a Krishnan, nor is it going to end with a Krishnan. This problem won't be solved if you kill me! Not just one, but thousands of Comrades would take my position. Brave-hearts! You will be finished, if I draw a line here with this. I'm not doing it, because I don't want to spoil the sanctity of Periyar with your filthy blood! Two days! I will give you two days time. You must demolish your resort and leave the hills. Otherwise, my boys would destroy you! Don't expect any mercy for this. Because, this is a Communist's word! A Comrade's word'.! Get lost! Comrade! Comrade! He did that for us.. Comrade was ready to sacrifice his life for us. Even the smallest things that you do for him, will be great deeds for us. The man who is in the ICU is not just a person. He has the love and faith of an entire village. That's where an individual called Krishnan, becomes a genuine Communist; a genuine Comrade. Basheerikka, the Doctor is calling you. I don't think we can get a clear idea until the surgery is over. We have shifted him to the OT. To start the surgery. There is nothing much to worry about. It's just a continuation of what we did yesterday. And, that wound on the right kidney which I told you about, Since he has only one kidney, Sir, what is this? Dad! It's because of me. It was for me! It was for me! It wasn't for anyone else. Dad did it for himself. Don't cry! Prabhakaran Sir's grand-daughter had a slight problem with her kidney. Sir had shifted to this town, for her treatment. As a replacement, Krishnan Achan donated his kidney! Nature doesn't have any such rule that, an intelligent person should live longer. And we are not breathing any more of the oxygen than her. Why are you standing here like this? Why don't you sit down? No. It's okay. Are you hungry? Krishnan's relatives? You should buy this medicine. Buy it from IP pharmacy. Okay. I need this medicine urgently. How much? - It's IP billing. Didn't I tell you? He is completely all rig ht. He will be shifted to the post-surgical ICU after some time. Didn't you leave, Comrade? No, I was about to leave. I think it's charged fully now. Aren't you leaving? You guys are here? Thanks. For donating your blood, and for being with us. In. Dear, your dad has been shifted to the post-surgical ICU. Doctor said that we can see him, standing outside. Come! Don't you want to see him, Krishnakumar? Comrade! Let me see him! - Comrade! Kichu! Don't you want to see him? No! Comrade is in my heart now. For some more time, let me be Comrade Krishnan. I will see him later. "You cannot become a Comrade just because you believe so and say it out loud" "if you stand up for people who are starving, denied justice and exploited; giving your heart and blood for them; they will address you from the bottom of their hearts; as a Comrade!" "Nothing has ever been able to replace that, in this world" Don't be scared. It's my phone. - I wasn't scared. It's Kichu. - Who's that? Hello! Where are you? L.. Where are you? What's happening there? What did you think of me? Did you think I would cancel it if I couldn't contact you? Kichu, you can trust me completely. Me, Bennychayan and his gang are all prepared here. Come! Mahesh, there's a small problem. What problem? Let's not do it today. Then? - I'll tell you later. Cancel the plan. Just tell Bennychayan. We'll think about it and decide later. I'm hanging UP- Hello? Rajeev, where are you? I have almost reached Market Junction. Where are you? Rajeev, there's a problem. You better leave from there. It's dangerous. Is it? Nothing to worry. Just go back. Let's meet tomorrow Dude, what's the problem? I will tell you everything tomorrow. Hang up. _ Okay. Hello? - Mom! Where were you? I called you so many times! My phone was switched off. Where are you now, Kichu? lam.. I am coming there now. I'm really hungry. Is there rice at home? Yes. But not many curries. - That's fine. Keep it ready. I'll be right there. Be careful. - Okay. Who is it? Who is it? Who is it? If someone is not working according to your whims and fancies, is it right to think that you should finish him off, Tony? If you do so, do you think that us Communists would stay calm, Tony? Who is it? Whoever it is, stop hiding in the dark! It's not me! You are the one who is in the dark. Where Comrade Krishnan stopped, we are beginning from there! ^.^.^.^.subtitles by.^.^.^.^ ® Sud_Arun collections ®
