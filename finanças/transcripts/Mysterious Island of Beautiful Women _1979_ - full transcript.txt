)baby crying) )lightning crashing) )baby crying) )dramatic music) - This is PBY Petramco, calling Guam, over. Guam, we have equipment malfunction, can you read, over? Yeehaw! )chuckles). Couldn't wait, sorry, to do this very much. My daddy didn't raise any fools. - Then who did raise you? - Oh, very funny. Never met a cop with a sense of humor before. - I'm not a cop. - Cop, bodyguard, same difference to me. - How you doing kid, do you need anything? - No, thanks, the painkillers are working. Sometimes I see a lotta flashing lights. You think that's a good sign, Mike? - Well, if it isn't, it ought to be, huh? - Some oil rigger I am. Plain stupid. All I had to do is shutoff that lousy gas valve before I poked my head in there. - Listen, lots of guys make that mistake. - How long before we get there? - We should be there right now. Where the heck are we? Where is Guam? - I don't know. That electrical storm we went through... Yeah, knocked out everything. - The radio? - Everything. I figured the wind's been blowing us north, so I've been heading south for about two hours. I called in every marker I had left just to get this job. So it's my first flight out, I got the president of the company sitting back there and I'm lost. Great, huh? - Well you better tell 'em. I mean, at least they can keep their eyes open and look for a ship or something. - All right, everybody, it's time to come out of the water. Flower! Chocolate, we must return home now. Bambi! Snow! Chocolate, please come here now. - This airplane was your idea, I don't like planes. You hear what I'm saying, Mr. Duvall? - You'll arrive at the same time and the same way that I do. - Well that ain't gonna be good enough. We're out here in the middle of the ocean, no gas, no radio, no land. - Why don't you just calm down? We'll talk it over and figure this thing out. - You're not giving me orders, I don't work for you anymore. - You heard Mr. Duvall. - Yeah, I heard him cowboy, and what I told him goes for you too. - Just settle down, Wendell. - Eh. - We'll all get outta this mess together. Huh? What are we gonna do, Mike? - Try to spot land or a ship. We could be 1000 miles from either one. - Yeah, you're dead right about that. Try raising him on 272.4. Now, if not go, back to Manila on 280. Somewhere in Manila we'll find somebody who can hear us. - Here, pal, this will help you. - Thank you. Mr. Duvall. - Yeah? - I heard the doctor talking to the foreman back at the base rig. He said the faster I get to a hospital the better chance I got to get my sight back. - Hey! - What? - Hey, off the right side of the plane, - What? - there's land down there. Where? - There's an island down there. Hey! Off the right of the plane. See it down there? Land. I got eyes like a hawk. I got the best eyes in the whole state of Georgia. See it down there? - I'm gonna take her down. )plane engine roaring) - Hurry! Hurry! )plane engine roaring) Eh, don't look like anybody's home. - It's not Guam, but at least it's land. )plane engine roaring) - Okay, I'm going in. It looks good over there, let's try it. Phew. Check that. Ugh, boy, this is all I need. Pfft, I don't know how deep these waters are, there could be reefs all along here, just below the surface. And all we gotta do is touch one we're in trouble. Phew! )sighs) Well I could use a drink. - Wrong. - )chuckles) Just kiddin'. )ocean droning) Think anybody lives here? - I didn't see any discos, did you? It's my guess that this is uninhabited. Stu! - Yeah. - What's out condition? - My last contact was Manila. I had no contact when we hit the storm. - They must be tracking us on their radar? - Too far from Manila, not close enough to Guam. We filed a flight plan, so at least they know we're missing. - It's a big ocean, how will they look for us? - Don't you worry none, Danny, boy, they're gonna come looking for us, all right, real hard. We got the president of Petramco on this here plane, and he ain't no Georgia cracker or blind boy, no sir. This is Mr. Duvall. Mister oil mogul himself. - Don't worry, they'll look for us real soon and they'll find us. In the meantime, I think we better get some wood ready for a signal fire just in case somebody comes close. Also wouldn't hurt to see if any food is available because all we got is junk food in the galley. - What about the radio, can we fix it? - I'll take a look at it. - What's our gun situation. - I got a.32 with me. You got anything besides that.38? - I have a 9mm tucked away. - I got nothing. - Any other guns? - Nope. Wanna go huntin'? - Sure. - Would you like to give me a hand? - Hey, Mr. Petramco! There ain't no bosses out here anymore. - Ya havin' a great time, aren't ya? - Hey man, you quit, they fired me, we don't owe him nothin'. - It's a good thing you're not bitter. - Sure smells good. - Gonna taste even better. - Stu, what about the radio? - I don't think it'll ever work again. - Where you going? I'll be back. - Look out for the crocodiles. - Aah. - With Karu and Baylor they can't be beat this year. - Well, what about Texas, are they bums? - Oh, Texas. Mike! Mike! Stu! Stu, what's going on? What? - Eh! Eh! Ah! You know, this is really a waste of time. Listen, if they want us, no dumb alarm system is gonna stop 'em. - Just keep talking, Wendell. Your skull will look real good on that propeller. - Eh. Stu must have been hitting that bottle pretty good, he's out like a light. - What about Danny? - I gave him a shot of scotch, but that doesn't do much for pain. What do you make of the jacket? - US Air Force issue, and it's been here a while. - How long? - Could be six years, could be six months. And that prop, it's off of DC-3. - You sure? - Yes, and I'd like to find it. - What for? - Look at the jacket. It's rotting, but it's not burned. That means that when the plane crashed, it didn't go up in flames. Now, maybe there's some usable fuel in the tanks. - Are you suggesting that we search that jungle after what just happened? - I don't think we have much choice, Gordon. - Well we've got some fuel left in the airplane. - Even if we had instrumentation, maybe we could find civilization. But we don't know where we are or what direction we're flying in. Now, I don't know what's out in that jungle anymore than you do, but I don't wanna run outta fuel in the middle of that ocean and end up playing with sharks. - Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Lord Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Any problems, you pop off one of these flares and we'll come running, okay? - You got it. - Hey, wait a minute. You're not gonna leave a blind kid and a juicehead to watch this plane? - Danny has got to stay here, and Stu can fix the radio. Now can you? - No, I can't fix any radio, and who made you the foreman? - You wanna take over? Here, take the gun, give the orders. Come on, take over. - Makes no difference to me. - Visitors? - Yeah. You ever do any tracking? - Zip. - I've done a little. - In Nam? - No, back in Georgia. I tracked down some chain gang escapees. - Wendell, you absolutely amaze me. Now look at this. Dug a boat up here on the beach, probably an outrigger because of these markings here. It must have been within the last hour, hour and a half, because otherwise the tide would've washed out these tracks. They let two men off. One of 'em went south, there near the jungle. The other one went north, went up the beach, he's up there ahead of us somewhere. - You know something, J.J., I don't like what's going on. - What do you mean? - Well, people have strange motives, you know? - You know, Mr. Duvall, you don't have to come with me. I'd be safer for you to wait back at the plane. - Ah, don't worry so much about me, J.J., I wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth, and I've had my share of street fights. - Just doing my job. - You do it well. We both know why you're here. The company's concerned that I might be kidnapped and they'd be hit for a big ransom. But you know something, if there's anyone in that jungle, I guaranteed their not interested in either one. - Just the same, I'm paid to protect you. And I expect I'm on the company payroll today, deserted island or not. )pliers rattle) - I'm gonna be 50 years old in March. Half a century. The last good year I had was 1951. Hey kid, you're awful quiet, you okay? These burns are hurting bad. - Didn't they give you anything for the pain? - Doctor just gave me enough pills to get me to Guam. I've run out. - Maybe I can find something in the first aid kit. - What is it? Who's there? - It's got salt in it from the backwash. Must be fresh water up the stream. - Let's take a look. - We better get back. - Mike! Look. Lord almighty, you're white! Hey, stop that, I'm not gonna hurt ya. Hey! Ow! - Wendell! - Over here. - Kelly, run! - Did she say run? - That's a white woman! Come on. - Lizabeth! Lizabeth! Please! I saw two men, Lizabeth! - What in devils? - Kill them. - No! No, Lizabeth! They killed a head chopper. He was chasing me. - Kill them! I, I think I got it. Wait a minute. - What is that? I don't like the look of that thing. And I don't like the feel of this place. I think we better get back to the plane. - I wanna have a talk with that lady. Lizabeth! - Stu! Danny! Stu! Danny! - No, no. - Stu. Wake up. Come on. - Huh! - Easy, it me, it's me. - I shot a flare, nobody came. - I saw two men by the river. - Head chopper? Bambi, he's killed. Oh, Bambi, he won't hurt you, he's killed. Oh. Oh, Bambi. - I said this junk wouldn't work. What are we gonna do if J.J. and Duvall don't make it back? - I don't know. - What do you make of it, Mike? White women are running around like natives, wearing GI issue gear. Talking English, but weird English. "Head choppers," I never heard word before. But I'll tell you one thing, J.J. and Duvall better make it back here on their own. 'Cause I ain't leaving here to go look for 'em. Those women are mean. If they're bad, what do you think their men must be like? Hail Mary, full of Grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of our death. Amen. - Sister? Sister, please let me in. Sister, a head chopper's been killed. His people will come looking for him. There are other men here too, Sister. They have guns. Please let me in. - Sisters! Sister! Sisters, they kill. )panting) They killed another head chopper. We saw them. Sister! Sister! - Hiya, kid. - Mike? - Yeah. We got back. You were asleep. - Can I have a drink? - There isn't any, you drank at all, Danny. - I gotta have something. It feels like red-hot pokers in both my look my eyes. - Just hold on, we're gonna get outta here. - When? - Soon. - You mean it? - Looks good. - Mike! I can't, I can't do anymore. Don't underestimate yourself, you can do it. Least you can do is come and help me. - Hey, how much help did you give us the other night on guard duty? You wanna get drunk, go to sleep, Stu? You gotta pay your dues. - Mike? - Okay. It's them! - Marty, they made it! We thought you two had bought it. - Yeah, we did too. We got lost and had to spend the night in the jungle. - We came across this village of women. - Did you see any men? - A dead native.. They have some kind of idol. What is it? I don't know. Mike! Mike! Easy now, be calm. Mike! Mike. - Easy. Easy. - We want him. - Let her take him. Hey, let's get outta here, let's take off. - Do you wanna get lost in the middle of that ocean without any fuel? Our best chance is with those women, I think they know where the aircraft is. Did you see some of the stuff that they were wearing? It was GI issue, and I think they got it off of that plane. - They're not gonna tell us anything. They just soon slit our throats. - You think you can find that village again? - I think so. - Let's go. - Are you crazy? - Do you wanna try searching that jungle for that plane? - All right, then let's catch one of those women and make her talk. - Sure, bring 'em all down on us. How many can there be? Eight? 30? Are there men? - I say we talk to them. - And I say let's do business with them. They've got something we want, let's find out how much it's gonna cost us. There must be something here they can use. Mirrors, frying pan, pots, cups, knives, forks. We're rich! - Yeah. - You're nuts. All of ya. - Those women, they must have done it. Could be a warning for us. - No, I don't think so. This is the spot where these two came ashore. I think it's a warning to the others. - Maybe we just found our bargaining strength. Let's go. - Please give me something! Please! Please! Please! I can't stand it! - Hey! Get down there and do something for that kid. Please help me! - You hear me? - I can't do anything for him. Help! - You're the one that got us into this mess. You're the one that put us down in this place. You drank up all the booze. Now you get down there and you do something for that kid or so help me. Now go on, do it! Danny. Danny, it's Stu. Danny, it's Stu, listen to me. Listen to me, you gotta be quiet, Danny. That guy's gonna kill us, he's crazy. Danny, please. Danny, Danny, listen to me. Danny, listen, I got a belt and I want you to bite on it. I want you to bite on with all your might. Bite down on it with all your might. That's it, Danny. Bite on it. Bite in it, Danny. I know about pain, kid. I know all there is to know about pain. You bite down, Danny. You gotta fight it, Danny. You gotta fight that pain. If you lay back it will come and get ya. That's it. You gotta bite on it like it's the devil's throat, you're never gonna let it go. That's it, Danny. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right. )seashell trumpets) - Look like nobody home. - Ah, no, no, no, they may be watching us. Lizabeth! We wanna talk to you! Lizabeth! We come in peace! We come as your friends! They're pretty good with those things. You bet they're good. Just don't go for your gun, that's all. - Lizabeth. Lizabeth. Listen to me, please. We know that you want us to leave the island, so do we. But we have no fuel, no gasoline. Now we know that an airplane crashed here once. If you show us where it is, perhaps there's enough fuel left for us to takeoff. Look. Look, Lizabeth. This, we'll trade you for the fuel. - No, we don't want it! - Lizabeth, we need each other. You know those other men are coming back to look for their friends. And you know what guns can do. You show us where that airplane is, and we will stay and fight. - Yes, I know what guns do. After you kill head choppers, I'll take you to the airplane. - How long before they come back? - Two days. Three. - Oh, that's too long. There's one of us who is sick, back at the airplane, he has terrible burns around both eyes. Just give us the fuel and let the pilot take him for help. - No! - We will stay and fight for you. - It's a trick! - It's no trick, I swear to you! - We have medicine for your friend. You go back to your airplane, I'll send someone to help. Take them with you! - But they're presents. Come on, let's go. - No! - These are presents. - Go away! - You're very kind. I've got something for you, Flower. Oh, I'm sorry. Did I frighten you? Taste. Ginger ale. It's good. Makes you sneeze, huh? You know, I have a daughter just about your age. Daughter. Baby girl. Mine. - Like Kitty, that's Bambi's baby girl. - Well where did she come from? - From Bambi? - Bambi married? Does Bambi have a man? - No, man. We killed man, he was head chop. - Now how often do they come here? - They come to give us babies and to kill us. They gave Bambi a baby, and Jo Jo, but hers was boy baby and Lizabeth killed it. - Lizabeth killed? How many of you have been killed by the head chopper. - Hmm... Three. And one got killed by snake. And one girl got killed by big fish. - Well, so you started out with 13, right? 10 and three. - 10 and five. - No, five are dead, that leaves eight. - Eight? 10 are left. - Well we haven't seen them. - Uh-huh. - Do me a favor, count to 10. - One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Eight. 10. - And what happened to seven and nine? - What is that? - Who taught you how to count? - Lizabeth. )Danny moans) - Lizabeth? - Here. It's coffee. See? It's not bad. - Coffee? - It wakes America up every morning. You know about America? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, a lotta people feel that way. How did you get to this island? Do you remember coming here? Did Lizabeth bring you here? Oh, too young. Well then who brought you here? - Sister. - Where's Sister now? - In her house. - Where's her house. Is she with the men? - No men! - No men? There were men here. - No men! - What about that little girl? She didn't come with you? - Flower! - Did she come on a plane? On a ship? Listen, we don't have to talk about this if it bothers you, it's okay. - Lizabeth be mad! - I know Lizabeth's name, and I know Flower's name, but I don't know your name. - Snow. - I don't know what they put in that drink, but it sure got the job done. Danny's sleeping like a baby. - Did you get any information from her? - Only that her name is Flower and she can't count past 10. - It's strange, it... It's like they're all children, you know? Like they, like they reach a certain age and then they just stop growing up. I mean, the names, uh, Snow, Flower. It's like they were named by a child. - Maybe one did. I haven't seen an older person around. - There's one. - Who? - Snow mentioned her sister. She says her sister brought her here and lives in her own house. - Flower, you go to see the sick man later? - Yes. - Let me go with you. - No, I go. - You went before. - She likes the one called Mike. Don't let Lizabeth hear you say that. - Get me into trouble! - It's true. - Stop it! - Can three go? - Sh. - Sister told me what to do. She said to be nice to the men. Don't tell them anything. And don't be alone with them. And after they kill the head choppers, then we kill them. )log splashes) )wind gushing) - Stu! - He's too strung out to go very far. - I just hope he doesn't take a dip in the pond. - Alcoholics drown in booze, not salt water. - You know, Wendell's right, they're beautiful. This whole place is beautiful. - You mean, kinda like paradise, huh? - Well, hey, man, I didn't say that, but we haven't heard any car horns or telephones lately, have we? - You mean you'd like to stay here? - Well, if it were for the headhunters. I hear that. - They're drinking coffee. - What's coffee? - It's good. I tasted some. Lizabeth's gonna be mad at you. - Oh, Lizabeth always mad! - Why'd you quit flying for Duvall, if it's any of my business? - I just got tired of being a flyboy. I wanted to plant my feet on terra firma for a while, you know? You got any kids? - Yeah. Two. - Divorced, huh? - Six years ago. She couldn't take being married to a cop. Too violent. So she took my kids and ran off with some career soldier. Every day I pray for a war. - What's that? - Psst, psst. Looks like you got yourself an audience. )upbeat harmonica music) - You wanna try it? It's a harmonica. - Amonica? - Imagine that, she's got an accent too. Harmonica. )blows on harmonica) )blows on harmonica) - What's that? - This? It's a California Angels baseball cap. - It's same. - That's a California Angels baseball shirt. - Baseball? - It's a game. - Oh, we play games. We play, uh, jump rope and hide-and-go-seek and, uh, hopscotch. - Who taught you how to play these games? - Lizabeth. - She must be a very bright girl? - Sister tell her everything to do. Yippee! - Come. - If I wanted to talk to your sister, how would I find her? - You can't. - Them fish, it got more moves than O.J. Simpson. Hey, how about you comin' in here and show me how it's done? - And what about you and the other girls? - Only Lizabeth. - It's only a kiss. Oh no, no, no, here, you take it. - You keep it. More kiss. - Hey, hey, ho! You're not gonna climb that tree. be good for that. - Yep, isn't it risky? - Risky? - Well you might hurt yourself. - Climbing a tree? )girls giggling) Here it come. More risky where you are. - You can say that again. Has she told you anything about her sister? - Only that Lizabeth tells her what they do. - I figured those girls for 26, 27. And Lizabeth for 32. And her sister's probably the same age. - Why do you say that? - Well, no adult ever taught those girls to count. There's no seven or nine in their language. I don't think they've ever been around any adults. Unless it was someone who's mind was arrested when they were five or six. - Well, that explains their innocent qualities. - Innocent as black widow spiders, my friend, There are no men on this island, and never will be. Oh, some natives come here once in a while for a manhood ritual. The child was a result of rape. The girl, Jo Jo, she had a baby. A boy. And they killed it. - Head choppers! They're coming to the beach! - Where! - How many? - One boat! We gotta hurry, tell Lizabeth. - Tell her we'll meet her up the beach, okay? We've only got three guns. We can only take three men. You wanna come? - You bet I do. - We're getting close, let's cut through the jungle here. - They're gone. They've takin the bodies and ran. Hey, we won the fight without even firing a shot. - Let's get the plane, get the fuel, and get outta here. - Amen to that, brother. You're all lovely the creatures, but I got my stomach working toward a thick, juicy steak, cottage fries, and three fingers of white light. - We kept our promise, Lizabeth. We were ready to fight. We kept our promise. Lizabeth! It's Stu. They cut off his head. - They be back. - How you know that? - This. We saw it before. When Kitty was born. They came in three boats. - Two of us got killed. But we kill many too. - How soon do you think you'll be back? - Tomorrow. - How many? - Many. - My shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me, thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou prepareth a table before me in the presence of mine enemies. Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. Amen. Make them good. Sharp. We might need them. )rock scraping) Sick? - No. - Not happy? - They not bad men. Lizabeth is wrong. - Sh. - She is wrong! - Sister tells her what to do. - Then Sister wrong! - Snow! - I take it back about Sister. How do we know Lizabeth does everything Sister tells her to do? - Lizabeth would be punished. - Sister never punish Lizabeth. Did you ever see her punish her? I wanna talk to Sister. - You can't. - They not bad men, and Jo Jo's baby boy wasn't bad! Lizabeth shouldn't have killed him, and she shouldn't kill these men. I want to talk to Sister. - Don't, you'll be killed. - Killed? Punished, maybe. - No. Killed. Remember when Dolly got killed? - Big fish killed her. - No. Lizabeth. Dolly wanted to talk to Sister, she didn't want the boy baby to be killed. Lizabeth killed her and threw her into the ocean. You saw that? - I promised not to tell. She said that Sister told her to do it. Where you going? - To see Sister. Sister! Sister, it's Snow. Please let me come in. I have to talk to you. Please let me come in. I have to talk to you. Sister! Sister! - Bad! Bad! - No! No! - Well, we have 31 rounds. - What you plannin' on doin' with this thing? - Well, if I can get there before they paddle in, I might be able to fire a flare into one of the canoes. Probably won't sink it, but it'll scare the hell out of 'em. - You know, I've been doing a lotta thinking about the girls. We might win the war with the headhunters. But after we're gone, what happens? - You wanna take 'em with us? - Why not? - Well, we could send somebody back. - Look, but even if they could find the place, it might be too late. - What makes you think they'd go with us anyway? - I think some of them might. - Like Snow? - Maybe. - You wanna see her in sneakers and cutoffs, holding a hot dog, cheering on the Angels at Anaheim Stadium, don't ya? - I just wanna see her safe. Hey, Mike! What the matter? - Are the head choppers here? - No! It's Lizabeth, she wants to kill me. I tried to talk to Sister and tell her you weren't bad men, and that you shouldn't be killed. - But why kill us? All we wanna do is to get off the island. - It's Sister! Sister says all men are bad and should be killed, but I don't think it's right. - Snow! You've got to help us. Where is the plane? - I don't know. I never saw a plane. - You must have seen a plane. Where did you get the clothes, the blankets, all the other things? - Where did, that propeller come from? - From, from Sister. Sister gave 'em to Lizabeth and she gave 'em to us. - Take me to where Sister lives. - But Lizabeth is gonna- - Take me there! - Snow, if we have to fight your friends, they'll die. You don't want that, do you? - Come. - Give me the flare. If there is any fuel in that ship, I'll send one up, all right? Come. Who built this? How long has it been here? - Since I can remember. - No, no, no, no, no, no. Sh, don't be afraid Don't be afraid. - Sister! Don't hurt us! We need to talk to you. Please! Don't, Sister will get mad! - This is the plane, didn't you know that it's right here? - Sister! Don't hurt us! We need to talk to you! Please! Sister. - There's no fuel, there's nothing. - Please, don't. No more. - Look, I have to. There might be some, some, some charts or something. It's all gonna be all right, don't worry, okay? I found the direction finder, Snow. - What is that? - Maybe, just maybe, it'll get us outta here. The plane has crashed. I don't know how many days ago. I have been unconscious. I cannot move or speak. My legs and myjaw are broken. Lizabeth is alive, and I thank God for that. But I think it was two weeks ago, which makes today May 27th, 1954. 16 babies have survived, but I think two will die before long. Lizabeth is my hands and my legs. Our Lord must have some purpose for her. How else could she survive what has happened to her? At five years of age, to see the death and destruction of war. And now to have this. I cannot talk to her, nor can she read. She's caring for her infant sister as though it was as natural as breathing. July 19th, 1954: Myjaw has healed, but I am still unable to speak. I think perhaps the accident has paralyzed my vocal chords. Lizabeth seems to thrive and grow stronger. She has named all the babies from nursery rhymes and children stories. September 3rd, 1954: The third baby died last night. He was the last of the boys to survive. Like the others who died, she discarded the body somewhere. Death seems of no consequence to her. I pray for their souls and hers. April 6th, 1959: I don't know how much longer our dear Lord will make me endure the pain. I pray Lizabeth will do His will. I pray for her again and again. I wonder if what I've done with these children is right? I've given them the respect for our Lord as I know it. It has been Lizabeth's responsibility for teaching the children. I never see them anymore. I fear that the sight of me will frighten them. Lizabeth fears soldiers. She has nightmares about them. No matter what I tried to indicate, any thought of men or guns sends her cowering into the corner. I have given the burdens of motherhood to Lizabeth, a 10-year-old child. I have no other choice. I only pray that what Lizabeth is doing is right. - Lizabeth, you can't fight those men without us. - It's not too late to let us go. We can claim those guns again and help ya. - Sister told me what to do. I'll give you to the head choppers. Then they'll go away from here. - Flower! Are you here, Flower? Don't let her do this. I know you wouldn't hurt me. Flower, let me hear you! Ugh. - No, Jo Jo, don't! Lizabeth, this is wrong. - Are you saying Sister is wrong? Sister said to do this. - No, she didn't. Sister Teresa died 20 years ago. Put it down. - Kill him! - All of you! Put your spears down or I'll shoot Lizabeth. You've had nothing to be afraid of, she's been lying to you. - Kill them! - He's telling the truth! She is dead, I saw her. Lizabeth speaks to no one. - She's lying! Sister lives! She lives there in her house, in the big bird. - The bird's just an airplane. It brought you here as babies. Cut them loose. - Mike! - Lizabeth! - Sister! - Sister told her to kill my baby. - Now who's gonna take care of my babies? Sister will be mad at me. - You know, Mike, what I don't understand is why don't we leave 'em behind and send somebody back for 'em? - Because we have room on the plane. - We're already low on fuel, that much extra weight's really gonna cut down on our range. - The direction finder oughta set us right on course. - Oh sure, if it works, that thing's 25 years old. - Well if it doesn't work, nobody's going anywhere, are they? - You know, it's just, it's incredible to me what that Lizabeth accomplished. Just imagine the, the life she had to lead, from the of age five. Sister Teresa died. She was a 10-year-old. She was left with a bunch of five-year-old kids to watch over. So, she increased her control by turning the dead Sister Teresa into a living, powerful, frightening recluse. I mean, it's incredible. - Look! Head choppers! - Hurry up! - Hurry. - Come on! - Come on! - Head choppers! - The plane! Ugh, come on, the plane. Our. - Hurry! - Hurry up! Come on, faster! - Come on, Kitty, hold on!. We've gotta go, come on! - Hold on! Come on! - Ugh! - Faster! Come on! Help! - Help! Oh, he's heavy. I can't. - Come on! - Help! Come! Hurry! - Danny, get on my back. - Argh! - Come on. Go on, you two, get outta here. Run! Don't wait on us. Get! - Okay, go, I'm covering ya. - Come on! Hurry! Come on. Easy. Straight in. Come on. Take it easy. Come on. You don't need that. Come on. You sit there. Now, buckles on. Buckle those straps. - Steps, right over here. Watch your head. - Buckle that trap. I gotta safe him. What's the matter? - It's damp. We're not gonna make it. )plane engine sputters) - Yeah, we're gonna make it, it's all right. Do you see 'em? - Good boy! - Now the other one. Come on, baby, don't let me down. Let's go, come on, come on, come on. You gotta help here. Watch the reefs. - Does it work? - I don't know and I don't care, let's just get outta here, all right? Are you ready? - Yeah. )chuckles) - Bye, Lizabeth.
