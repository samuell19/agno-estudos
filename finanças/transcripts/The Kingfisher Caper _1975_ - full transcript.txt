(slow music) (beeping) (birds squawking) (beeping) (kissing) (triumphant music) (announcer speaking foreign language) - [Driver] Thank you. - Hey! Tracy! - Johnny! But how did you know it was going to be here? - I didn't. What brings you back so quick? - (sighing) I'm home again, Johnny, for keeps this time. - Oh, I'm sorry. Should I say that? - No, not really. No point. - Does the old man know? - Not yet. How is he? - Lots of wear and tear. I'm glad you're back, for his sake. - And you? - Me? I'm off, up to Cartridge. Look, why don't you come along, just for the ride. What do you say? Then you can tell me all about it. - Is there time for me to change into jeans? - Yeah. (upbeat music) - Where the hell have you been? - I had business at the bank. - Did you? Just what do you do all day long. Johnny works his off, and my son fits around-- - Oh, not old Hero-Boy again, please. - He happens to be the best diamond man in the business. - Yes, and the sun shines out of his backside, and I'm sick to death of hearing about it. Now, where's the brandy? I told you yesterday there wasn't any brandy. - It isn't brandy you need, it's work. Now, stop playing about. Playboys don't make good diamond men. - Well then, get rid of him, give me a chance. That is, if you really want to know what I can do. (plane rumbling) - Well, here we are again. How does it feel? - Out of this world, Johnny. Just like old times. - Do you remember that house we built in the trees? - The one brother Benedict had to pull to pieces? - Right. And then told your dad he'd done it because he's caught us playing mommies and daddies. - (giggling) Yes. - What a beating I got. I was black and blue for days. If only it'd been true, it would've been worth it, but what kind of an orgy can you have when you're 11? (laughing) - Johnny? - Yeah? - How about Ruby? - How about her? - How come you married her? - Long story. Little boys who think they're big boys do some pretty odd things at times. - Little girls, too. - Yeah. Look. Down there, Thunderbolt Gap. The most beautiful sight in the world. - [Tracy] It's okay, but I don't see what makes it that beautiful. - Because roughly a million years ago, rivers to the south were spitting diamonds into the ocean. Because those rivers dried up, the tides have been moving the diamonds northwards ever since. And because down there, you see that reef? In gullies on that reef is where a hell of a lot of them must have got stuck. - Well, then why don't you just go and get 'em? - Because, my little historian, when we took over the mandate for the Germans after World War One, our government decided to grant the concession for mining Thunderbolt to the big company. - We're still out working it by the look of things. - They will in time. When you've got so much, you can afford to wait, can't you? But I'll tell you, Tracy, I've got the same feeling as a water divider. There are millions of carats of diamonds stuck on that reef, I know it, I can smell 'em almost. I can see the shine of them through 160 feet of water. If only I could put Kingfisher into that lot. (plane rumbling) (ticking) - I want the truth. (sad music) - Three, four months, perhaps. I'm sorry, Hendrich. - Thank you. (engines rumbling) (exciting music) - Look, Tracy, the old way of getting diamonds off the beach. I got the idea of pulling them out of the sea when I was studying in America. I'm replacing all that with my boat, Kingfisher. I don't like it, Rez. Come on, you know every trick in the book, let's stop. - Our workaround is all coming. I'm gonna replace the ships and mix up the crews. - Good, I think you should. And restrict access to the plant, especially at night. - Right. - Tracy and I will go and check the perimeter. (beeping) Now, that's strange. What the devil's old Sampson doing along this stretch of the beach, playing with a toy boat? - Why don't you ask him? Perhaps he'll let you play with it, too. - (chuckling) I will. Hey, Sampson! Grab that boat. (engine rumbling) Come on. (engine sputtering) (groaning) All right, you! Start singing! How much, how long, who for? Bury you, I swear it. Who for! - All right then, I'll tell you. (slow music) - [Benedict] There. How 'bout that. - For me? - God, you're a greedy. You can't get enough, can you? Never satisfied. - You don't do too badly. Pretty well, I'd say. Just keep on trying. (door slamming) - Benedict! - It's Johnny. - [Johnny] Benedict! - Why? - [Johnny] Come on, Benedict, where are you? - You. - He never knew. I swear it. - [Johnny] Benedict! - Well, you wait here, and you keep out of sight. - Where are they? - Good evening. I don't know what you're talking about. (punching) (groaning) Johnny, Johnny. Johnny, you won't tell the old man, will you? - What? And tell him he's being robbed by his own son? I'll spare him that, but not you. (yelling) (splashing) (onlookers chattering) (birds squawking) (boats honking) (honking rapidly) (cheerful music) - Bonjourno, Johnny! I arrive, Caporetti is here! - Bonjourno, Capitano. (crew speaking Italian) - [Crew member] Caporetti. (kissing) - The man's got style. - Yeah, and a built in compass. He's the best there is. - Santa Maria, she look like hell. We don't shave off one, two years. - It's finished, Cappy, this is just frosting. - Hey, Johnny, I'll wait for you to call. Everyday my wife, she scream, I drink more, more, I come, and she not finished. - It is finished, I told you. Let me show you. - You wanna show me? I've seen this ship before. - Not like this, you haven't. - (chuckling) If she float, I sail. - I'm sorry I'm late, I got caught in traffic. I thought this was just family. - It is. - Well, shouldn't-- - Now, sit down. I want him here. Right. The Van Der Byl Diamond Company. I'm splitting it up three ways. One third yours, one third yours, and the remaining third for you. - Mine? - That's what I said. You're not deaf. - But sir, I wasn't expecting-- - You weren't expecting anything, were you? Not a damn thing. But that's why you've been creeping and crawling for years. Now you've finally made it. - I've sweated out a lifetime putting this show together, and I don't need you to tell me how to dispose of it. There's just one thing. Your third is in Kingfisher, and the dredging concessions only. - That'll do me, sir. - Every other asset of Van Der Byl, mines, properties, beaches, has been put into a separate trust for my son and Tracy. You will be chairman, managing director, and executor. - But when? - I signed the documents this morning. Here, see that he gets them. You always wanted authority, power, responsibility. Now it's over to you. Right. Finished. - [Man] If you could spare me a moment, Mr. Benedict, I'd like your signature on this please. These documents, can we? - Yes we can, we will. Thanks, father. Glad to have your confidence. - [Tracy] Let me get you a drink, Dad. - Oh, stop fussing, girl. I'm just tired, that's all. - Why are you doing this, Dad? - About time I chucked it in, retired. - Leave it with your last breath, not before. - That's about it. - So, what about Kingfisher? - [Hendrich] Well? - She's not finished. - I've sunk a couple of million in that diamond barge of yours, and now it's up to you. - But what does he do for money? - He goes to the bank, the loan still stands. They'll give him more time if he needs it. - But now you've made Benedict the boss. - Sir, it's never going to work, I wish it could. - Now, you listen to me. The bank's your boss, not Benedict, not until that loan's been repaid. - The loan was for Kingfisher, the company. - On your personal guarantee. You believe in that floating fortune, don't you? - I think it's going to be the biggest thing you ever started. - One third's yours. - Look, you took me in when I was a kid, you raised me, you taught me, you beat the hell out of me. But in the end I was a good diamond man, your man. And you don't owe me anything. - I owe my son, Johnny. I owe him a chance. - Well, if that's how you feel, Dad. But I can't help thinking, it's you who's taking the chance. - Dammit, there must be enough of me in him to make it come good in the end. And I have other reasons. - Sure. - So, the pair of you... Get the hell out of here. You've got more work than time before that bank loan's repaid. - (kissing) See you later, Dad. You know, for a man who's retired, you certainly know how to keep things moving. (horn blowing loudly) Are you gonna sign me on, Johnny, or not? - What as? - Now look, I'm not just a dumb blonde, you know? I did get a degree in South African history, remember? - Sure, big deal, but that's digging the past, Tracy, and this is today, and we're digging for diamonds. - Now listen, for start, you're not gonna get any help from Benedict. - That's as sure as hell. - So you're gonna need a tough guy like me. I mean, mentally tough. - Okay. You tell me, how, where? - Right, on the end of a telephone, bashing a typewriter, stalling the creditors, keeping an eye on my one third and yours. Helping you to float this damn dream boat of yours. - You really do think that I can't manage without you, don't you? - You're darn right I do. - Well I'll tell you something. You sold me, partner. Shake. - (gasping) Hooray! (laughing) - Come on. - [Tracy] Oh! - No, this way. Right around. Oh, skipper, we've got a new crew member. Cappy, Tracy. - Oh, very nice Johnny, but where she gonna sleep, then? - As sure, Cappy, as sure. Come on. - Very good, but doesn't make no harm in asking, do I? - There, look at that. It's my vacuum cleaner. - [Tracy] What does it do? - Well, we stick an extension on the end, reach down 100 fathoms, blast away the seabed, and suck up what's lying underneath. It's a pretty fancy vacuum cleaner. - The beginning, let's have a look-see. (whirring) You know what that is? - A concrete mixer? - Not quite. I call it my cream separator, same principle. Takes the gravel from the pipe, spins it, and then spews all the waste back into the sea. - And what happens to the cream? - It gets dried in hot air in here, gathered onto a belt, a conveyor belt inside here, and then, at the bottom of this chute, passes into the X-ray room. - For diagnosis? - Diamonds show up very sharply, fluoresce, under X-ray, you probably know that. It pinpoints every one. So, when the X-ray machine reports the presence of diamonds to my computer up top, where they're blown, sucked, screen-separated, dried, and discovered all on one ship in once process at one time. (whistling) Also where they're spent two and a half million. - Well, the way you tell it, Johnny, it sounds cheap at the price. (upbeat music) - Costs are close to 100 an hour. - [Benedict] 118. - All right, 118. We worked at the beach for 60 hours for just around 200 carats. I think the beaches are drying up. - Well, what do you suggest we do about it? - We're doing it. We're finishing up Kingfisher just as fast as we bloody well can, but it's still one heck of a job. - Yes, well, you don't sound too sure. - Oh, I'm sure. But Kingfisher is new. It's something that's never been tried before, there are problems, complications, new ones everyday. But we're meeting them, beating them, all we need is time. - The interest on the bank loan becomes to you in three weeks, how much is it? - Just over 200,000. - Where will you get it? - No problem. The old man fixed it. The ship's going to be worth over two and a half million finished, that's damn good collateral, the bank will extend. - But the bank's out of it. - I don't get you. - Well, the bank has nothing to do with it. - Then who has? - Me. As managing director of the trust, of course, I've relieved them, I've... I've taken over the loan. - Meaning? - When payment becomes due, I can't give you an extension of time. - So, that's it. - Well, I have to protect the old man's half a million, for my little sister, of course. We can't go throwing good money after bad, can we? - Got you. - Good. So, you pay on the dot, or I take over the Kingfisher for myself. Is that clear? - You're not doing this for me, Benedict. - But I am, as your executor. - No. You're doing this for you, as usual, not only despicable, but utterly pathetic. (knocking) Oh, come in, darling, it's lunch time, and I've quite an appetite. - Oh, hello, Johnny. - Well, that's one thing I do have to thank you for, Benedict. You're welcome. (birds squawking) (laughing) I'm glad you could make it, fellas. - Okay, Johnny, I'll take that now. - Yeah. Don't be late tomorrow, will you? - But Johnny, there was a whole lot of aggro. - Don't give me any of your crap. If I can be here at eight, you can be here at eight. - Okay, Johnny. Thank you. - Hey, Johnny. Hold it down to work to work, or no dames. Push push. You got two weeks. - Yeah. Two weeks. (slow smooth music) - It just didn't work out the way I planned it, that's all. - Nor for my dear husband. How's he going to raise 200,000? - Yes, but, but he believes he can. That's the point. I know he does. - Listen, Benedict. You've got the company, you've taken his wife, and in three weeks you'll have his ship. - Yes. But taking his wife away from him seemed to be the one thing that gave him any joy. - Thanks. Don't start drinking, darling. - And don't start giving me orders, do you hear? I'm not taking orders from anyone anymore. Not ever. (machine whirring) (workers chattering) - Right. You promise delivery tomorrow, and I promise you C-O-D. Well, we're not exactly broke, you know? - Not exactly but as near is, dammit. - Bye. We're right on schedule, Johnny. Come on. Glazed eye and a stiff upper lip. - 17 more days, still not operating, the loan to pay, and almost clean out of cash, skint. So, you tell me, tough guy, what do we do? - Money, that's what I need. - Well, that's no problem. You're the right person in the right place, a bank, just tell me how much. - 230,000. - Tracy, child, that's an awful lot of money. - Against my share of the estate, Phillip, surely. - Your share's in trust. You'll get the income, can't touch the capital, not unless the executor agrees. Have you asked Benedict? - No. - But it's my money. What right have you to say no? - Every right. To safeguard the estate, protect your interest, and to stop you making a fool of yourself. - Why do you hate so much? Make everything so ugly? You have everything you ever wanted now. - No, no, not quite, not yet. - You're still a child, aren't you? Trying to get even for things you only imagine. - Are we finished? - Oh no, not yet. Not by any means. But don't you understand what he's trying to do, Dad? To Johnny, to me, to all your plans for Kingfisher. - Yes, I think I do. - But is this what you thought, what you intended, when you put him there and told him to take over? The Kingfisher won't be a loser, he knows that, but he's going to make certain that we lose Kingfisher. Unless you do something about it, Dad, you are the only one who can. - Father, I appreciate your concern, I really do, but whether right or wrong, the decisions now are mine. - I put you there, son. - Yes, and if I may remind you, very late in the day. - Why are you so bitter, so twisted up, boy? - Am I? Could it be from having to grow from the roots of a very large tree, Father? In the shadows. - Johnny managed it. - Well yes, he would, but that's where all the nourishment, wasn't it? Not even your own blood. - I'm sorry you should feel that. - Oh, don't be. We shall manage a happy end, somehow. - Benedict, I'm asking you. - You're asking me, Father? - Because I'm a sick man. - Yes, I think you are. - I've told no one else but you, only you. - Well, that makes my responsibility all the greater, doesn't it? You're not fit, you're not well enough to know what's best for the company. Go home, rest. And don't worry... I promise you, I won't let Johnny Lance get away with a thing. (crickets chirping) (slow music) (clock ticking) - [Hendrich Voiceover] My darling Tracy, please try and forgive me. It is not the pain I fear, but the burden I know I shall be to others. The box is for you, Tracy. Inside you'll find every diamond, every piece of jewelry I gave your dear mother. Keep one piece in her memory in mind. We both loved you very much. Sell the rest, they belong to the past, my past. Kingfisher is the future, yours and Johnny's. They should bring you more than enough to meet the interest on the loan. God bless you. Your loving father. - [Young Benedict] What's Johnny doing here, mommy? Why did daddy bring him home? - [Mother] He's part of the family now, darling. Another brother for you and Tracy. You must be kind, dear, love him. - [Young Benedict] But I don't love him! I hate him! I don't want him here! - [Young Tracy] That's a horrid thing to say, Benedict. I want him here, I want him here always. - [Young Benedict] But he's not our real brother! - [Young Tracy] No, and he's not unkind and spiteful like you. You're just jealous, that's what you are. - [Mother] Now, stop it, both of you. Johnny and Benedict are going to get on fine. You'll see. - [Young Benedict] But I told you, I don't want him here! I hate him! I hate him! Hate him! Hate him! Hate him! Hate him! I hate him! Hate him! Hate him! Hate him! (echoing) (screaming) (crashing) - [Hendrich] What's your name, boy? - Johnny. - [Hendrich] Well, you'd better come with me, Johnny. - Knowing you for the man you are, Johnny, I'm expecting you to be against Tracy selling her mother's jewels. So, for the last time, I'm not asking you, or telling you, I'm giving you an order. You see it's carried out. One more thing... I want you to know, you've made me... Very proud of you... As a diamond man, and as a son. (priest mumbling in foreign language) Your loving father. - The house and all its possessions, I leave to my esteemed and dutiful son, Benedict, who will pay me the elementary respect of not converting it into a brothel until my body is quite cold. Ruby! Ruby, where are you? What have you been doing? Pricing the goods in the shop? Not bad, eh? - You know, you're the kind of a man that makes a woman feel really good. - You think I can't? - Come here. Darling. (slow music) It's another way to keep warm. - Slow, slow, slow, slow it down! Treat it with love! Good! Nice height! Okay, bring it across. Good. Okay now, easy, easy. Slow, slow, slow it down. Get down here. - That was one hell of a thump. - Open this up right away, Bob. Get the computer boys to check this out for damage. - Aye aye. - Hey, I'm sorry, Johnny, it was an accident. - How long have you been doing this job, Joe? - Long enough. - That's how I figured it. - And my name ain't Joe, okay? - Whatever your name, go to the office, get your money, and get off this ship. - I was hired for the whole of the refit. - And now you're fired for the whole of the refit, so beat it. - [Man] Watch out, Johnny! (intense music) (groaning) (groaning) - You know, this is no accident Johnny. It was deliberate, I'd like a word with the man who paid him to do it. - That's quite a rig. - You can not imagine. (chuckling) The man say it cause a revolution for the diamond mining. - And how's the work going? - Sometimes fast, sometimes slow. It all depend. - Well, when do you expect to be out at sea? - Maybe two days, maybe two weeks. Sometimes I think maybe two years. I'm just the capitano, I can not tell you. (mysterious music) - Yes, it's a very fine collection, Ms. Van Der Byr. - They belonged to my mother. - It's a pity you have to part with them. - I wish I didn't. How much are they worth to you? - I'm afraid more than we can offer you. Shall we say, 250,000? - Couldn't we say 300,000, Mr. Stanley? - Ms. Van Der Byr, I knew your father, it was impossible to argue with him, so I do not intend to bargain with you. 300,000, and it's a deal. - Thank you. (woman yelling) (people chattering) - Caporetti? Caporetti? - Capitano Caporetti. - Excuse me, please, Capitan, you are a very famous man. Kingfisher, no? - Si. - Working for Mr. Lance? - With Mr. Lance. Always Caporetti works for himself. - I would very much like to drink to that. And for the lady, too. You must be a very rich man, Capitan. - You say rich? I've got a nagging wife, bambinos, I like the wine, and too many woman. You tell me how I can be rich? - You should be, you could be. - Could be, could be Rockefeller. - That I think not, but rich, yes. - Ciao, baby, I see you maybe later, okay? - Tell me, how much you think I can be rich? - Capitan... Do you tell me... 20, 30, 40,000? (upbeat music) (buzzing) - I don't know, Cappy, I'm worried. Where the hell is Tracy? - Santa Maria, 20 times you ask me, I don't know. - Why did she take off with all that money? - Maybe she go to beauty parlor? You know woman, eh, Johnny? - Look after things, I'll be right back. - Look after things? I'm gonna sell the boat! - Yes, sir? - Ms. Van Der Byr, please. - She's out, sir. - How do you know? - Her room key's here, sir. - Would you, could you call her on the telephone, please? Check her room. - Sorry, sir, no answer. - Thank you. If you see her, would you leave a note and say that John Lance was here looking for her? - Certainly, sir. - 100 to win on Snowflake, and then the De Villiers handicap. It's 250 each way. (phone ringing) Hello? Yes, put him on. - Benedict, have you seen Tracy? - Where did you get the money. Where were we? (exciting music) (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Tracy On Phone] Hello, Johnny. It's me. - Tracy. Where the hell are you? - [Tracy On Phone] I'm at the hotel, no questions, just come right over, okay? - In two shakes of a duck's bottom. (knocking) Where the hell have you been? - Sit down, Johnny. - [Johnny] I don't want to sit down. - I poured you a whiskey and soda. - And I don't want your whiskey and soda. - I think you're going to. - I'd like to know why, without a word to me. - And I'd like to tell you, in my own way, if you'll let me, please. - Right. And this had better be good. - Now... Remember the day you flew me over Thunderbolt? - I do. - And I asked you if they'd worked it for diamonds when it was German territory. - Well? - Well, that started me thinking. - That reads a 21 gun salute. - About history. - You've already told us, Professor, you took a degree. - Now, don't go selling it short, Johnny. And don't keep interrupting. Now, here is a translation of a German proclamation, dated May three, 1899. For a period of 999 years, and for a consideration of 10,000 marks, Mrs. Farbon Hendricks Mosental of Windhoek Guarna Merchants are granted sole and exclusive rights to mine Win-- - Look, what the heck is all this about? - Thunderbolt, Johnny. - Thunderbolt? But didn't I also tell you that when South Africa took over from the Germans-- - Our government immediately confirmed and ratified all concessions already granted. You never told me that. - Didn't I? I mean, did they? - Thunderbolt still belongs to Mrs. Farbon Hendrickson Mosental. - Not if they sold out to the big company. - But they didn't. - Then how come years later, the big company is given the rights? - Impossible, illegal, invalid. - But who says so? - The law, I've checked. - My god. Then where does all this take us? - I'll tell you where it took me. Over some of the worst roads in Southwest Africa to Windhoek, to one very old man, a son of the original Mr. Hendricks. What's left of that firm, he owns. - Then what? - I bought it, Johnny. Lock stock and barrel. He asked 20,000, I gave him 40. Plus, it will send it once we're in profit. - There's got to be a hit some place, I just can't believe it. - That's what he said when I talked about diamonds. He said he was too old to care anyway. But you can believe this, Johnny. Signed by me as a director of Van Der Byl, the deeds to Thunderbolt. - Holy cow. - [Tracy] Still don't want? - Oh yeah, gimme. Wow. Tracy Van Der Byl, you're too much. You're too dusty, you're too dirty, you're too wonderful, and I love you! (laughing) (romantic music) - What was that, Johnny? - I love you. - Say it again, Johnny, please. - I guess I always have. - Oh, Johnny. - Everything's gone wrong, every damn thing. - For the moment. - Well, how many moments do you think we have left, stupid? He's paid the interest, and handed Thunderbolt on a plate. And Kingfisher's almost equipped. So, when it's equipped and running, how do we make it fail? - But you own one third, does it matter? - Of course it matters, it's all that matters. I want Kingfisher 100%. Mr. Johnny Lance crawling, bust. So, how do we make it fail? - That little Japanese gentleman you were telling me about. - The one who made the little electric boat? - Wouldn't he help you? - Osaki. (cheering) - [Man] Congratulations, man! (laughing loudly) - [Man] Ah, we've done it! (crew speaking over each other) - [Cappy] Oh, Johnny (muffled) sail my boat, eh? - Hey, Johnny, terrific. Congratulations, congratulations. - Yeah, but will it work? - I only make things that work. Like the boat, it worked. This one work, too. How will you get me on the ship? - Well, how much time will you need? - Hard to say. - How much time will you need? - Mr. Benedict... This is very dangerous work I'm doing for you. - So? - You must make it more worth my while. Perhaps another 5,000 grand more? - Yeah, you'll get it. - I'll need six hours. (horn blowing) (door closing) (horn blowing distantly) - [Man] See you, man. - Night. (groaning) (punching) - So, tomorrow, you start laying on provisions and stores. - Hey, Johnny, what's the work going on underwater? - There isn't any. Don't we look busy enough? - Well, there was a guy who came up the side just now. - No guy came over the side just now. - I tell you, I saw him. - Maybe his father Neptune, no? - Not maybe, in a black diver's outfit. - Wait a minute, something doesn't smell good. Cappy, get some of the boys together. Search, start forward and work aft. (smooth electric music) Mack, we've got visitors, uninvited. You take the engine room, I'll take the postal. - [Mack] Hey! (groaning) (punching) (explosion) - [Man] Take him. Easy, easy, yeah. Okay, push him more. - [Johnny] Let me get in with him, you drive. - Thank you, Matron. And give him our love. Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye. - Well? - [Tracy] (sighing) They operated this morning. - The arm? - They had to. - Dammit. Mack, of all people. - He'll have to lose more than an arm before they'll get him down. Apparently, directly he came 'round, only one thought, a message for Johnny Lance. Here's a rough translation of Matron's Gaelic. Do not fuss yourself, man, it's only a wee small scratch. And keep cracking on Kingfisher. - Scotland forever. But he's right, we gotta keep cracking. - So, what do you say? We losing more time, eh? - Looks like it. - I no like it. Caporetti grow tired from waiting. - It's the same for all of us, Cappy. - But it's not the same. I'm on half pay 'til Kingfisher sail. (bright music) Tell me. When Johnny, he want to punch your behind, what he do? - Pinch my behind? But he doesn't. - Ah, that is what I was thinking. You must eat more spaghetti, more pasta, huh? I promise you, presto, in short time, you got a behind to pinch. - What? - Johnny, I have to rebuild six circuits. - How long? - Tomorrow lunch time. - I've got to have it by tonight. - But I can't do it. - Can you try? - I'll do my level best. (smooth slow music) - Let's circle the fleet. Cup of coffee for you. Come on. (beeping) Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Welcome aboard. I'll buy you a martini next time I see you. Thank you very much, I appreciate that. - [Benedict] Well? - The interceptor is in position. No diamond of any size will get through. - And the computer will register negative, you're sure of that? - Quite. - Hmm. It's quite a view. - And a meeting place to conclude a successful transaction, Mr. Van Der Byr. You have a soul of a poet. - I'm just security minded, that's all. I hate taking chances. - You have my consideration? - Naturally. He'll settle with you. (yelling) (smashing) (cheering) - Let's go to work, men! (triumphant music) - It feels good, no, Johnny? I'm a Caporetti again, Caporetti the Capitano. Bridge? - Hey, Johnny, you start the full log, okay? - Engine room? Okay. What do I say? (Caporetti speaking Italian) - Hello, Chief? Johnny Lance. May I have the main engines, please? Starboard clutch, please. Is that all? Okay, Chief. I'll see you at Cartridge Bay, three days! - [Tracy] I'll be there! - Don't be late! It's gonna be kinda lonely. - [Tracy] You've got your computer, and Cappy. - Yeah, but I don't fancy them! - Good luck, Johnny! (upbeat music) - Darling? - Hmm? - [Ruby] What happens after? - After? - You've scuppered dear Johnny. - Ah. - I was thinking of us. - Well don't. - [Ruby] Why not? - I am not suitable soil for the clinging vine. - You're talking in riddles. - Am I? Well listen, we had a deal, right? Well, I proved I could have you, I proved I could take you away from him. I mean, that's what it was all about. As it happened, it seemed he didn't give a damn, but well, that took the icing off the cake for me, but you've got yourself some nice diamonds, a mink coat. - That's very generous. - Yes, that's what I thought. I mean, that's pretty good pay for services rendered. - You don't give a damn, do you? You don't. You can't feel anything for anyone. - Oh, don't go taking it personally. You're good, I must say that for you. Really good, tops. But too much of a good thing can be bad. - Cappy, what's your position? - H-74, H 52.5. - We're in position, lay your anchor. - Let go starboard anchor. We're here, Johnny. - Start praying. (exciting music) (beeping) Cappy, move to grid reference 0.23. - [Cappy On Phone] No bullseye first time, eh, Johnny? - Right. (beeping) (sighing) Two day's work for a handful of crap. Doesn't make sense. - What I can say, Johnny? - Well, fold it up for today. We'll start again tomorrow. - Ms. Van Der Byl. - Yes? - I'd like to talk to you if I may. - Do we have anything to talk about? - You may think so when you have what I hear to say. - I'm sorry, I don't think I want to. - Please. For your sake, and Johnny's. - Very well. (dinging) - Cappy. Cappy, wake up. Come on, hey. You awake? - It's three o'clock. - Cappy, we're going to Thunderbolt now. - Now? What you talking? - We're going to Thunderbolt right now. I know there are diamonds there. - You crazy, I cannot take my ship there. I know that place, bad current, no! - I'll divert the current with explosives. - You'll divert the current. You think you're God? - Cappy, it's Thunderbolt, now. (crickets chirping) (slow music) (match lighting) - [Benedict] Cold, Ruby? (gasping) - No. - Thought you'd gone, forever. - I'm going. - Yes. - I came to collect my things. - Come here, Ruby. - What for? - Come here. Kneel down. - Why? - I said kneel down! Now, tell me what you've been doing. Where you've been. - To see your sister. - You did what? - She's on her way to Cartridge Bay, Benedict. She'll be there tomorrow. - What did you tell her? - Everything, about Osaki, a little machine you fit into the Kingfisher, everything Johnny would want to know. So, you're not going to win, are you, Benedict? Johnny's going to beat you again. He always will. (slapping) (breathing heavily) (groaning) No. No, don't. No. Please. - Why did you! I have to now, don't I? - No, don't. - I have to. - Don't, Benedict! (gun firing) (birds squawking) (whirring) (explosion) - Let's move into the gap. (ominous music) - Kramer! Take me out to the Kingfisher, quick! I've got to get out to her. - More mad. Why have you to go? - Now look, don't waste time, man. Someone's blown it, Johnny Lance knows everything. - Knows what? - About the diamonds, the bugging, the lot. - God. - And there's only one person to handle him, and it has to be me. Now, will you get moving? - Cast off. I didn't know you were part of the setup. - What? My little brother, manage our fortune on his own. You must be joking. (engine starting) (horn blowing) Johnny. - What the hell's going on? - I've got to talk to you. - What? - I've had a long talk with Ruby, there's some kind of a deal going on. They're out to break you. They've put a device onboard ship. - What kind of a device? - [Tracy] I don't know, but it's for collecting the diamonds. - Collecting diamonds? But where could it be? Where have they put it? - She didn't say, she didn't know. - It's got to be between the recovery room and the sort tanks, right? - If you say so. - Well, it's got to be. Come on, this is the sort tanks room down here. (muffled speaking on radio) You okay? - [Tracy] Yeah, fine. - Good. No, everything's okay here. Okay, scope tunnel is next. (squeaking) (honking) (honking rapidly) - Good afternoon, Mr. Benedict. You can't take that in here. - Oh. (crashing) (machine whirring) (beeping) - What is it? - I don't know, let's take a look. Here, hold this. Fantastic. It's some sort of an electronic device - Are you sure it isn't part of the system? - Oh no, not this. Must be an interceptor. - Kramer! - Well, what went in there? I can't see it. (squeaking) (gasping) - My. - My god, unbelievable. Look at this. Just look at this! - Enough to pay the bank five times over! - Unbelievable. So much for Mister bloody Benedict. - So much for Kingfisher. She's done it, she's done it! - [Benedict] When I get on board I'll scuttle the ship. - And then what? - We'll go across the boarder. You pick off Caporetti. - And the diamonds. (knocking) - That's funny, did you close it? - No. - Hello. Hello. Come on. I can't wait to see your brother's face when he realizes we've out-foxed him. Hello. That's funny, I can't raise anybody. Hello, Cappy? - Where's Johnny? - In the sort tanks room. - And my sister? - She's with him. (ominous music) But you leave that with me. - It stays with me. Where are the diamonds? - First you tell me your plans, then I show you the diamonds. - You better show some sense, I'm scuttling this ship, now. - Huh? And my crew? Johnny and the girl? - Your crew will be all right, they'll get their payout. Now get it moving, and fast. - [Cappy On Speaker] This is your captain speaking. Abandon ship! Abandon ship! Abandon ship! This is your captain speaking, abandon ship! Abandon ship! (banging) - It's Benedict! Benedict! - [Tracy] What's he doing? - By the look of it, he's going to blow t he feeder. - What will that do? - Pump her full of water. - What do you mean? Sink her? - And us. - Benedict! Benedict don't! Please, don't! Benedict! (gun firing) (explosion) - Johnny, can you hear me? Go to the front of the boat manhole cover, I open it for you now, Johnny, okay? - What do we do? - Come on! - The diamonds! (snapping) (muffled whispering) - We've got to get to the computer room and cut the feeder motor. (groaning) (yelling) (splashing) (gun firing) (yelling) Cappy? Cappy? - Sorry, Johnny. Diamonds drive Caporetti crazy. You eat pasta, Tracy, okay? (sad music) - Come. (boat creaking) (exciting music) - Mayday, mayday, mayday. (gun firing) This is Kingfisher, this is Kingfisher. (gunshots) (gunshots) Benedict! Benedict! (slow music)
