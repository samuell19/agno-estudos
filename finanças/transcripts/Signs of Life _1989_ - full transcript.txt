[TRUCK DOOR CLOSES] You need a belt. [SIGHS] There's nobody here. We're early. [SNIFFS] Are you getting a cold? No. You sound sniffly. [SNIFFS] I'm okay. Get that. The box. You gotta empty your locker. Why? Why? I told you why. The yard is closing today, and we aren't coming back anymore. Is Mr. Coughlin coming in today, Daryl? I don't know. [HORNS BLOWING IN DISTANCE] Uhh. [DOG BARKING IN DISTANCE] Oh, my god. It's silly to be afraid of dreams. Dreams are just stories people tell themselves when they're asleep. And who's afraid of stories? [GROANS] Widows and children. God knows you're not a child. Now you know as well as I do when you close the business, and everything gets settled down, you will sleep like a baby. MRS. WRANGWAY: Are you going to go down to the launching this morning? It's your last boat. You ought to go and see them off. It's a beautiful day. [GRUNTING] [VOICE ECHOING] [GRUNTS] MRS. WRANGWAY: I know, you can go fishing all you want. Mrs. Wrangway! To hell with fishing! Call John and get my pants. I'm going to go to work.

No. Took off. -She did? -Yeah. Did you tell her? Uh-huh. You did? Did you have a fight? Yeah. What'd you say? About what? About leaving? I just said Daryl and I are going to Florida, to be salvage divers, and that means it's all over between us. Done. Finished. Finito. Finito? Finished. You tell him? I told Charlotte. [ENGINE CONTINUES RUNNING] [FOOTSTEPS] Who's that? Looks like Charlotte. Charlotte! Oh, my goddamn ear! Shit! Charlotte! Oh, wow. Did you see that? Yeah, I saw it, Eddie. [BRAKES SQUEAK] Did she have it? -Did she? -Did she? Did Mommy have the baby yet? [ALL SIGH] It's not her fault. If it were me, I'd try to be a little more organized on it. Since when do you know anything about having babies? I know plenty about it. Like what? Like fallopian tubes. Big deal. Butter Daddy's toast. Ovaries, I know ovaries. You wouldn't know an ovary if someone come up and hit you in the face with it. What's an ovary? You almost finished with the shirt? All done. Well, get a wiggle on it. He doesn't want to be sitting around here in his t-shirt all morning. Daddy? Mr. Coughlin called when you were in the shower. He said you should pick him up on your way to work. He'll be waiting in front of his house at 8:00. He said to tell you, he wants to try and save the boatyard. [KETTLE WHISTLES] [BELL CHIMING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [TRUCK APPROACHING] So? Head over to Wilson's. -Wilson's? -Yeah. What for? Maybe I can sell Wilson. [Chuckles] was that your idea? Is that it? It's worth a shot, isn't it? I don't know. Maybe you got a better idea, huh? No. Let's go to Wilson's. Okay, sure. [CHUCKLES] Good morning. Good morning. Mr. Coughlin's coming into work today. -He is? -Yes. So I thought we'd have a little party this afternoon. I bought a cake. Well, don't just sit there. Go and get it. It's big. I know. It's very big. -Easy, easy. -Not so fast. Joey, watch out. Hold it straight. -Eddie, don't tip it. -I got it. I don't think it's going to get in there. Move it up. Move it up. -Move it... -Come, it's not going in there! All right. [RADIO PLAYING INDISTINCTLY] Wait, move over. Move over. [GRUNTS] For Christ sakes. Let's go from the inside and pry it up. Joey! Joey, come here! [MUSIC PLAYING] Joey. Okay, grab one of this. Put the radio down. Grab a hold, and use both hands. He's got it. Right? MAN ON RADIO: Mike plays the left hand, Barnacelli plays the right hand. Perfect... It's stuck. Well, I did my half of the deal, right? I broke up with Charlotte, I got the car fixed. Right? [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [BUZZING] MAN ON RADIO: Bud Wilson has given me permission To let the cat out of the bag here By telling you that... It's the sash, is what. [MAN ON RADIO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [BUZZING] Guys? MAN ON RADIO: ...Live, up in sky heaven. Bring the kids and wake up Grandma for this one. Did you even get him placed in that school yet? You know, I think that if we both grabbed each side of the sash and pulled, and then with our free hand push up on the window, it'll come up. Guys! Guys! Guys! [BUZZING] Go! Push! Aah! Ohh! [MAN ON RADIO SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, shit. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] I don't think we can serve this. -You'll get another? -I'll get another. Ohh. That baker was sure proud of that cake. Don't tell him we dropped it. What are we going to tell him? Tell him we ate it. Right. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [TV PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] Is Evan Wilson here? Can we see him? Can we talk to him? MAN ON TV: ...so a lot is riding on this game. So let's, with no further ado... Hey, Wilson. I got something very important to tell you. Can you spare me a few minutes? I'd like to talk to you about boats. Do you ever get the feeling you'd like to get out in the water again, hmm? Do a little fishing? Do you ever get that feeling? -Owen. -I do. Hell, I know I'm old, but the water's just as important to me now as it ever was. You know, sometimes I just got to get out there and feel the throb of a diesel under my feet. Owen. Don't you go telling me that you don't still get the urge. Owen. 'Cause I know you do. Huh? Ha, ha, ha, ha! Don't ya? Don't ya? Owen! Huh? What are you doing? Stop it! We got to get out of here. Come on. Sorry, Mr. Wilson. Wait a minute. What the hell are you... Come on this way. Wait a minute. Why do we have to... This way. Sorry, ma'am. Damn it. I haven't had a chance to say a word to him. What is the matter with you? What the hell is the matter with you? You couldn't see that guy? That guy's not going to buy a freakin' boat from you. You can't see that? I got a right to try, don't I? Try? Try what? The guy's had a stroke. He did? Owen, Owen. You've known Wilson for 40 years. He didn't know who you were. Joey! Joey! Joey! Joey! You ready to come back? It was a bee. I hate bees. Did you get stung? Yeah. No. It's sticky. Uhh. [CHUCKLES] [LAUGHS] See you in there, Owen. [GRUNTS] Hey. Hey! What are you guys up to? We was digging a hole this morning. Struck cake, John. Funny. Hey! What are you doing? Mr. Coughlin, I told you three months ago To start packing up your stuff. You didn't do it, did you? No. Well, now I'm doing it. Now, you have no right to... I will stop on one condition. What? If I stop, you start. Start what? The filing cabinet. [GRUNTS] [DOG BARKING IN BACKGROUND] What is that, the bow line? I told Eddie to put that on last night. I'll do it. Back to work. [TELEPHONE RINGS] You get it! [RING] Riverside. It's Eddie. I'm not here. She's not here. I know she's there so just put her on the phone. You tell him it'll be a cold day in hell before I ever speak to him. It'll be a cold day in hell before she ever... Jesus, listen here, Bucko. The lady says she's not talking to you. All right, give me that phone. Oh, fine. That's just fine. I'm going back and I'm slicing pie. You got a lot of damn nerve. [TELEPHONE RINGS] Fuck you, Blondie. Who? Dr. Pound? There's no goddamn Dr. Pound here. Oh. I'm sorry, doctor thought you were a friend of mine. Did you put some diesel in it? Yep. -Lead the fuel line? -Uh-huh. How about the paint touch-ups? They're all touched up. Do you want me to do them again? You think we ought to? John, we've been touching up for three days. I think you should let it go. It's done. It's not going to get any doner. John! I guess you're right. Hey, John! John, uh, the doctor called. He said your wife went back in labor, you should get over there. [WHISPERS] Mrs. Wrangway. -Mrs. Wrangway! -Yes? Look there! -What? -On that fishing boat. What? What is it? For God's sake, I'm not even asleep. I'm awake. Right? Yes, yes. You're awake. Well, how can I be awake? You can't be awake and have a nightmare, can you? I'll get a doctor. He'll give you a pill. I don't want a pill. Well, what is it? Tell me what it is. There's someone that's following me around. Who? I don't know, I don't know. I'm not sure he's really even there. Oh, don't be silly. You're fine. You're just fine. -[SINGING IN PORTUGUESE] -[HONKS HORN] -[SINGING IN PORTUGUESE] -[HONKS HORN] [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE] [TIRES SQUEALING] I'm coming.

Now we're out of business. Nobody wants what we make anymore. [HORN BLOWING] [TELEPHONE RINGING IN BACKGROUND] -Doctor? -False alarm again, John. Sorry. -Where is she? -Down here. Just when we think she's going to have this baby, she just clamps down. I'm going to run some tests. I'm not worried or anything. She will have this child. It's just when you see her, -try to say something encouraging, okay? -Beep beep. Oh! Look who's here. Mary Beth, how you feeling? You all right? Oh, I'm just peachy, John. Did you think about what we were talking about? Yeah, I thought about it. I just, you know, haven't come to a decision yet. What is so awful about working in the hardware? I never said it was awful. -Well, you think it. You do. -Honey. I just think that there's other things I could do. I told you that. What other things? There aren't any other things. There aren't any other boatyards around here. I saw an ad in the fisheries paper. There's this builder in Maryland. -He wants-- -Oh, Maryland! Who the hell's name's going to Maryland? I was just thinking it might-- John Alder, let me clue you into something. In about one day, you're going to have five kids. We're not moving 400 miles just so you can get another starvation job -in a boatyard. -Now, you just wait one second there. That was no starvation job there at Coughlin's. Last year I was taking home 200 a week. 197.36. And I'll tell you something else, Mr. Financial Security, not a whole lot of people would consider $200 a week luxurious for a family of seven. I'm sorry, honey. I know you were doing your best, -but we need money. -[DING] Now. And if it takes working for my brother to do that, then that's what you got to do. -John. -[DING] [SIGHS] Money. It's lunchtime. [ENGINE REVVING] Peanut butter? Apple. Milk. [ENGINE REVVING] -And don't spill it. -Okay. -All right, and don't throw it away, eat it. -Okay. -All right. -[ENGINE REVVING] Don't, um... -Just... -What? Just don't do anything. Look, don't do anything. Eddie and me are going to grab some lunch at the diner. We'll be back in a little bit. [DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE REVVING] -You notice anything? -Should I? Of course. Like what? You don't notice anything strange about this conversation we're having? What? [WHISPERS] Like I can hear you, and you can hear me. Oh. You got a new muffler. A whole new exhaust system from headers to tailpipe. You know what that means? That means this car is finished. It is perfect. Why, it's really nice, Eddie. Thanks. You know what the first place we'll hit is? Daytona. Ever been to Daytona? You know I've never been to Florida and how could I have been to Daytona? Oh, you've got a treat in store for you. Daytona is... [BARKS] When were you in Daytona? I didn't say I was there. I read about it in books. In my magazines. Come on. It's fun. I just don't want to get sidetracked, you know? We have jobs in Miami. I just don't want to get sidetracked. [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING IN BACKGROUND] [HORNS BLOWING IN BACKGROUND] Welles... Welles. No. Let's make it alphabetical. Give me Anderson. Mr. Coughlin, don't do this. Just give me the number, please. 2-3-1-1. 2-3... I'll show that bastard. Mr. Coughlin, don't, don't do this. Hello! Put Buddy on! What? Then put his son on! Now look here, you. There's something I want you to know. Your granddad bought a boat from my granddad, your dad bought a boat from my dad, and you bought a boat from some factory in California. And you know what? You put me out of business, you bastard. Fiberglass? To hell with fiberglass! To hell with you! Now, get me Barber's. Mr. Coughlin, do you want to lose every friend you ever had? -What good did they ever do me? -Mr. Coughlin-- Give me the goddamn number. 9-0-7-5. Oh, when I get a hold of these sons of bitches. They're going to bleed. What the hell? -Damn it. -[BELL RINGING] -What's wrong? -Goddamn phone's dead. Well, maybe the phone people turned it off. They were going to turn it off tomorrow. Maybe they did it a day early. Yeah. Now, I have a full load in the car. I'm going to take it over to your house now. You go right ahead. [FOOTSTEPS] How do I look? Charlotte, I have to be honest with you, honey. You look like you just stepped out of a plane crash. All the crying and being sorry for yourself and the whole world isn't going to keep him here. You really want him to stay? Okay. I have an idea. You want to hear it? -You got to be a new person. -Huh? Show him something about you he's never seen before. I don't know, Betty. I think he's seen about all of me by now. That's no attitude. Look. The next time he sees you, you just be the hottest thing he's ever seen. You just be something he can't stand to leave. You just go on up to him and burn that boy down. You do it right, I guarantee you, he won't even know what hit him. You got it in you. I know you do. You just got to put your mind to it. Okay. -Betty? -Hm? What if it doesn't work? Well, then we'll try something else. We'll come up with something. [MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Where's Eddie? -He's in the car. BETTY: Yeah, just a second. It's now or never. He's out in the parking lot. I'm coming. Anything else over here? More coffee? -[BELL DINGS] -[WOLF WHISTLE] I guess I'll have the usual, Betty. -Hi, Eddie. -Hi, Charlotte. Jesus. Sorry I socked you. It's all right. I had it coming. Car looks nice. Yeah. I put in a new muffler. Wanna hear how she sounds? Uh... No. I'm sure it sounds great. Yeah... It does. Real throaty. -[GIGGLES] -Real throaty. What was it you wanted to explain to me? Well, Charlotte, you got to look at things in the long-term. Take us, for instance. Say if I would have spent the rest of my life here with you. I wouldn't know what the rest of the world was like. [MOANING] East Hazard is not a very big place, when you consider the whole East Coast. I know I'd cut out on you sooner or later. I know I would. Who cares, Eddie? I just think it would be better, just to get over with it now. [BOTH MOANING] Mr. Coughlin, I think it's dead. -What? -The radio's dead. -Can you fix it? -Let me see. [STATIC] It's alive. Hello. You build boats here? You in the market? You wanna buy a boat? [RADIO PLAYING] Let me show you around the shop. You know, we've been building boats here For over 132 years. Not me personally, you understand. I've only been building them for 50 myself. [BOTH MOANING] -Oh God, Charlotte. -Oh God, Eddie. -Oh God, Charlotte. -Oh yeah. [GLASS BREAKS] Did you hear something? I don't know. I just heard something break. I wasn't listening. Son of a bitch. What? I think you broke my windshield. -Oh, oops. -Oops? Oops? Jesus Christ, this car was perfect. -I'm sorry. -Do you know, how hard it is to get a windshield for one of these? I know, Eddie. This is a '69 Chevelle. I know, Eddie. I said I was sorry. -This is a classic car. -I, I... Let me up. Let me up. [ENGINE REVVING] Shit. Dickworm. MAN: 140 bucks for Number 2 Pine. [BELL CHIMING] [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING] -Hello, Ernie. -What can I do for you, John? Oh, I, uh... I need, uh... [CHUCKLES] -Yes? -What I mean is, uh... I know you and I in the past, uh... We haven't seen eye to eye. But, uh... I need, uh... I mean, Mary Beth and I need a job. Mary Beth wants to work here? No. Mary Beth and I. -Job's for me. -You need a job. Yeah. Could you give me a job? Maybe, maybe not. Depends. -On what? -On you. On me? I don't know what kind of worker you are. Ernie, I've known you for 20 years. Why do you want to work for me? I'm flat on my back. I'm broke. -Want to be a salesman? -Anything. I don't care. Do you know what that means, to be a salesman for Pure Thrift? I'd sell things. You don't just walk in and become a Pure Thrift salesman like that. First you have to apply. Then you have to get somebody who's already in Pure Thrift to sponsor you. Want me to sponsor you? If the main office in Wichita gives you the ok, then you have to go to the Pure Thrift salesman center and take the Pure Thrift oath. Then and only then do you get to wear one of these. Of course, the one you'd be wearing would be green signifying a salesman in training, but... Who knows, John... Someday you might get to wear the black hat. Of a full distributor. Two more good years and I'll be wearing a red hat. Senior distributor. I've got some applications in the back. -Want me to get you one? -Yeah. Sure. [ENGINE REVVING] [TIRES SQUEALING] [WHISPERS] It's Uncle Ernie. -He says Daddy robbed the hardware store. -Are you sure? Are you out of your mind? What's the matter with you? You know as well as I do... Daddy would never rob a store in a million years. Jesus. That's the biggest lie I ever heard in my life. My daddy isn't a crook. See, that's the problem with women. They don't care about things, real things. Like cars and windshields. Well, I got you a cheeseburger. -Shit! -All right, all right. Come on, calm down. I'll get you a new windshield. Let's go to the retarded school. -Now? -Yes. It'll be a load off your mind. Have him placed somewhere. You know, I bet I can get you out in the water, for a lot less than you think. Not that we'd sacrifice quality. No. [LAUGHS] When I build a boat, it stays built. Now, I know what you're thinking. Fiberglass. Right? Now, you listen to me, young fella. I'd sooner put the sea in a goddamn Clorox jug, than half the boats they're building these days. I've always said, and I think my assistant here would bear me out, that a man really isn't a man, until he's at the wheel of his own vessel. [CLICKS TONGUE] Out there, to feel you control your destiny, with your own two hands. We could start today. You'd have delivery in 90 days. 90. What the hell am I saying? Eighty. Eighty days. We'd go around the clock if you needed it sooner. What do you say? Well... I'd say y'all done building boats here. Want some gas, John? Huh? Gas. No. Uh, anything else I can do you for? -Some uh... oil maybe? -No. Uh-huh. I gotta go... Down to Maryland. Today? Yeah. Eh, ain't your wife having a baby or somethin'? Gotta go. You sure you don't want some gas? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I have never been so humiliated in my life. I swear to God, if I ever get my hands on him again, I'll kill him. I mean it. If I'd have been holding a gun, I'd have shot it. You must really love him. I mean, if you want to kill him and all. Is that my coleslaw? Mmm-hmm. I don't know what I am going to do. I don't think I have a reason in the world to keep living. Why? 'Cause we're supposed to be together. He's perfect for me. How do you know? Because as soon as I saw him, I didn't want... anybody else. He's my man, Betty. I'm his woman. And all I can think is, he's just too stupid to figure that out. Charlotte, there's just one thing in the whole world that's stronger than a woman's love. And that's a man's pride. Those are your onion rings. You got to kick him in the pride. Where's that? EDDIE: Which way? DARYL: Take a left. EDDIE: Left. DARYL: It's a shortcut, remember? [SIGHS] That was the worst yet. [CLICKING TONGUE] Sweet Jesus, he's talking to the thin air. [CHUCKLES] JOEY: Is he gonna buy a boat? OWEN: Huh? JOEY: That man? No. Why not? Because, he wasn't... Hey, you saw him, too. I saw him. What was he wearing? The man with the hat? A hat? What else? [LOUDLY] What else? [WHISPERING] A suit. So... It wasn't just me talking to thin air, was it? Nope. [CHUCKLES] He's still not gonna buy a goddamn boat. Why not? [LOUDLY] How the hell do I know? Who cares? Lousy, stinking... Fifty years of my goddamn life in this business! Freeze my ass off in the winter. [CRASHING] Boil my ass off in the summer. I got 58 stitches, from where that son of a bitch in Ripsaw, jumped up, clubbed me right across my friggin' arm. You think I miss that? You think I liked it? I'll tear this place apart. -Every goddamn thing. -[CRASHING] Look at this stuff! -Stinking garbage! -[GLASS SHATTERING] [MUTTERING] [GLASS SHATTERING] This... This is my father. It's right near here. Yeah, right, Daryl. Doesn't look like there's anything much near here to me. Sure there is. Like, what? I don't know. What do you think those crows are doing? I don't know. Probably something died over there. You think? Sure. You gonna come back to see Joey? Yeah, sure. Gonna go to the school? Yeah, assuming I can find it. Hey. Are you gonna stay there? -Sleep there? -Yeah. I don't know. What's that rhyme about the crows? What rhyme? That thing that you say, when you see crows? -Crows? -Yeah. I think that's about dogs. What? What the rhyme's about. No, it's not dogs. It's crows. It's something my mom used to say, "Counting crows." -Your mom? -Yeah. DARYL: She used to say, there's one for something, two for something, three for something... You never heard of that? No. She used to sing it, to Joey and I. Never heard it. Hey, come on. Let's go. It's getting late. We'll find the school tomorrow. [SQUAWKING] That man that came in, that was my father. JOEY: Huh? I didn't recognize him. It's been him all along, following me around. Coming back to size up his boy. Huh? Coming back to look at the yard. -[GLASS SHATTERING] -What does he see? Nothing. An old fool and an idiot. Oh, what the hell am I telling you for? Go on. Get out, get out. Leave me alone. [CRASHING] [SCREAMING] Get out! [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] [SPLASH] [SEAGULLS SQUAWKING] MAN OVER RADIO: Covering the tri-county area for 30 years, This is 1370, WBEN.

DARYL: Well, hurry up. EDDIE: Take it easy. Have some cake. [BELL RINGS] [SLURPS] -[DOOR CLOSES] -[BELL RINGS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] So how are things over to the hospital? Fine. Doin' a good business over there, are ya? It's fine. I got to talk to you for a second. You'll have to wait. I'm just, talking to Dr. Pound here. He's a doctor. [SLURPS] Are you doing anything tonight? Tonight? You want to go to a movie, with me? Charlotte, what the hell are you doing? I'm arranging a night out, and I would appreciate it if you wouldn't interrupt. How does Love in the Dusk sound? Have you seen that? -Well, I... -You eat your soup. The hell are you doing? You said we were going to see other people. So? So, that's what I'm doing. I'm seeing someone. -Now? Today? -Why not? CHARLOTTE: Now, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to continue this conversation with my friend, William. Willard. Whatever. Charlotte, we are having a little party down at the shop tonight. And you are coming with me to this party. Oh, I am? [KISSES] Yes, you are. Well, if my friend Willard will give me a rain check. Surprise! Owen. What happened? I lost my temper. But these... These are all your things. This is... This is your life, and you just smash it up? I got no use for it. What the hell does it matter? Where's Joey? I threw him out. Why? He was staring at me. I'll not be stared at. Not today. Where did he go? I don't know. You don't know? No. Joey? [LOUDLY] Joey? CHARLOTTE: Joey's going up to the training school? DARYL: Yeah. I'm going to place him tomorrow. Well, I hope you both have good luck, in Florida. MAN OVER RADIO: That was John Reid, the Rhode Island Red singing, "God Loves all of his Children." So you just about got it made. Well, it looks like fog and showers, pushing into our region by night. So take it nice and easy. Now, here's one I know you'll love...
