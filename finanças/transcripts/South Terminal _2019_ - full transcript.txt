SOUTH TERMINAL For God's sake. Roadblock up ahead. Keep calm, everyone. They don't look very friendly. Keep going. Bit more. - Open the doors. - Everyone out! Bring your stuff. Everybody out! Empty the bus! Move it! Look what I found. Look at this! Hands up! Faster! Get everybody out! Move it! Check what he has. What do you have? Take it out, put it there! Brother, we did nothing. Documents and bags! Quiet! Keep quiet! Quiet! Take everything out. Put it here. - Gold too! - We haven't done anything. The watch too! Let us go. Our children are expecting us. Whose is this bag? - You're military? - A private. 3rd Infantry Regiment. Take him away! Get in! We work. We're working people. Quiet! Anyone moves, you're dead. Let's go. Load it up, guys! Move it, let's go! Come on, get in. Quickly, climb aboard. Go on, get in. We can't hang around. Let's go! Come on! A visitor. Hello. - Glass of water? - No, thanks. Like I said... It was this morning. A fake roadblock on the hilltop. - A fake roadblock? - I don't know if it was that... Or real military. All I know is, they took all we had. - You never saw them before? - Never. - They're not local? - I never saw them before. Come on, no locals would pull a trick like that. They're not from around here, for sure. So who were they? Bandits, terrorists, military? - Any idea? - I don't know. I don't know, but not military. They wouldn't rob us, surely! They were armed and in fatigues. So what? Every store sells military fatigues, so who knows. A soldier wouldn't rob us, surely! Right? I don't know. The idea is that they protect us. That's the idea, yes. They took my takings. My takings for the day, they took them. 20 years as a driver, first time. It's too dangerous. Something must be done. I read your paper every day. That's why I came by. - The police won't do a thing. - Thanks, sir. Thank you. We never met, right. Not being negative, but I raised this issue numerous times already. That all these roadblocks are increasingly suspicious. That they're using military methods to terrorize the population and foment chaos. It's out of hand. We cannot remain silent on this and pretend it's not happening. The guy came in here to talk to you about it. He expects us to do something. We can't stay out of it any longer. I totally agree, Nacira. We'll run something on this in tomorrow's edition. Fine, taking into account what he said, but also... Previous cases. Yes, previous cases. And call out the police. The police can no longer remain silent on this, like nothing's happening. Like he said, the military's job is to protect people. Nobody's buying it. But we don't know who it is. We don't know yet. So, we must explore every hypothesis. Exactly. - You're on foot? - My car broke down. Open the bag. Search his bag. Open it. Search it. What's going on, doc? We hear things. - Little rumors. - What? Nothing good for you or your reputation. Ok, go through. Walking. Go on, good luck. You can get dressed. - Stay here? - Right there. Ma'am it feels like... It could be an embolism. It would be sensible to do an ECG. It can be very serious. - You've been like this for long? - I don't know, doctor. I'm really not well. So... Since my husband went missing, I'm not at all well. One day, he went to the mosque. I haven't seen him since. I've looked everywhere. Hospitals. Police stations, barracks. There's no sign of him. I was told not to report it. And that he's alive. How can I believe them? What's your husband's name? His name's Mourad Ziali. You have a photo? Z-i-a-l-i, ma'am? Let me see. That's him? Yes, with our children. I'll ask around, ok? I'll see what I can do. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ziali, you need to do an ECG. What you have is very serious, very urgent. If you have an embolism, you could die of it. What about these beautiful kids if you're gone? YOU'RE IN OUR CROSSHAIRS How are you, doctor? And you? How are you? - Good, and you? - All good? - In shape? - In great shape. - Doctor, how are you? - Good, and you? Hello, how are you? That's not good for your lungs. You smoke on the sly, thinking I don't see you. So how are things? - You need me? - We're sick. - You look great. - Thanks, doctor. - Don't worry, it's all good. - Thank you. Don't worry. - My best to the family.- Inshallah. Poor guy's panicking. White as a sheet, weak... - Who? - Him. The big guy. - What happened? - I don't know. He's strung out, weak. They need to watch out, chain-smoking. I can't take any more. I'm out on my feet. I can't get anything done. I'm dead beat. And, wait for it... It happened. I got death threats. At the hospital and at home. At the hospital, soap in a cloth. You know what that means. At home, a brown paper envelope, containing a coffin and a message. "Watch out" or something. I burned it. Never before. First time. Scares the hell out of me. Honestly, I'm scared. I never felt anything like it. I don't know... See the world we live in, brother? How did it come to this? How did we get to a world where people threaten a doctor? It contains stethoscopes and medication. Not a bomb! You know... I see guys come in now, shot to bits. Missing a kidney, their head... I see stuff, Moh. I see stuff. Is that our country? That's it now? Sure. Brothers taking each other's heads off. And I have to treat them all? What will you do? Keep going. What time is it? That's the right time? Beautiful watch. It's quarter to. It's 15 minutes fast. Really beautiful. It's a Swiss chronograph. From the Russian army. Khoyot. - That's a famous make? - Sure. - No, not famous. - But it's a Russian make. It's a real Russian air force watch. I love it. Beautiful! One of the Algerian generals gave me it. You saw that Algerians have created their own brand of smartphone? It's extraordinary. - Concorde. - Condor. Condor! First it was TVs, then refrigerators. And now smartphones. I heard that it's the... For value for money, it's one of the best! I looked what magazines had to say 'cause it sounded interesting. - Unbeatable value for money. - Except for the weight. Six kilos! There's nothing that could ever... There's always... - Everybody agrees... - Home sweet home. Awesome telephone, really great. And every time, there's a hitch. Every article said, just one drawback. A small hitch. Always the weight. I feel like I'm leaving the market with lots of food. You do? Sure, when you have a Condor. Nobody can fit it in their jacket. Makes sense, it's a Concorde. - All go ok? - Sure. Morning. You have anything for us? You saw what happened? They killed the slaughterhouse director. Anyone claim responsibility? There was a crowd outside when I drove past, like... Who knows what they'll do? It'll close, I guess. That will be one more shortage for people. - Shortage of what? - Meat. There is none. Take that out. On the ground. Police! Get in! Stop, don't! You bastards! Who are you? Nabil, stay with me. Nearly there. Look at me. Hang in there. Look at me, just look at me! Two nurses to surgery, fast! Stay with me, hang in there. Breathe! You're doing good, Nabil. It's right there. We're there. Quick, help me! Stay with me, Nabil! Hang in there! Help me! Come and help me! We're losing him. Where were you? I was with your brother. Holding him when he went. What do you mean? I got there too late and... I couldn't save him. They shot him in the back. What? When? He's dead. Cover him. Gather the sand over him. Gather it, as we must. Mom! Breathe in. And out. Again. Hold it. Breathe out. That's fine, Mr. Benoussa. It's not looking great. How many cigarettes a day? I don't know, doctor, but it's not... Smoking's not the problem, it's... It's all I drink. In what sense? I drink a lot. Way too much. I can't stop. And since... Since I left the Patriots, it only gets worse. I feel useless. Some nights, I drink... liters and liters of wine. Whole cases. I can't be the only one with a drink problem here, right? In my case, it can't go on like this. I bring shame on my family. My 20-year-old can't bear to look at me. He enrolled in the army. Couldn't you give me some pills? Valium or something like that? For sure. I can give you tranquilizers but... It's not automatic, you know. I'm happy to prescribe a small amount. I'll send you for a liver x-ray. Ok, doctor. That's the most urgent thing, in your state of health. That's all, Mr. Benoussa. Here, give this to my secretary. - Come back with the results. - Fine. Thanks very much, doctor. Goodbye. Goodbye, Mr. Benoussa. Hello, Hazia. Hello there. Blessings. I heard about your poor brother, God bless his soul. Peace be with him. I had no idea what happened. - I just found out or I'd have come. - It's fine. Blessings, sister. Peace be with him. - The best always go first. - True. May God protect you. Greetings to your mother. - Goodbye. - Thanks, bye. Goodbye, sir. See you. Come back, doc! On the way out, what's the point? It's pointless, I'm coming out. - Protocol. - Search him. Pat him down! Hold still. Can I go now? See what you're like? You think that will do you any good? Your drugs. Your alcohol. So what? If it doesn't interfere with us, with my work. Or interfere with you. Maybe there's a reason why I drink. That's what you advise your patients? You think you'll save the world that way? It's disintegration. It's human degradation. You're just a shadow. You're a ghost. I live with a ghost. Yeah, right, keep going. Like I give a damn. Like I give a damn what you say. I don't give a shit. Keep talking, I don't hear you. We need to get out. That's it, there's nothing left! What are you clinging to? Like it or not, you know why I stay. It's insane, you harping on about it. It's insane, you can't get get your head around the fact that I want to stay. I can't take any more. This is not my idea of a life. Put your words into practice. Pack your stuff and go. If you like nothing about me now, go. Not even my beard either, right. What else? You're the doctor, right? Yes, that's me. - What can I do for you? - Come with us. We won't hurt you. We need you. I can't. I'm on call at the hospital. Come to the hospital like normal folks. - If I refuse, what then? - I'll blow your brains out. Go on, get out! Not a sound! Alright, I get it. Head between your... Stop, get off. - Take it easy! - Calm down! Take it off. We won't hurt you. Keep calm, don't worry. You need me? We hear you're a very good doctor. Thanks for the compliment. - After, you'll let me go? - That depends. What needs doing? A fever needs treating? A bullet needs removing? Both. How long's he been running a fever? Three days. He's delirious. He trembles. He rambles. He's a saint for us. An officer of the highest class. Nobody comes close to him. You'd better save him for us. Or I'll plug you between the eyes. Keep moving. Don't move. Open your mouth. I'll give you a shot now. A shot of morphine. Where's my syringe? - Put a light on that. - Give him some light. Look at me, look at me. Open your eyes. It'll be ok. I'm scared. Open your eyes, look at me. He'll be calmer now. Water. I need water. Get him water. And a clean cloth. Here. Move, you're in my light. Give him some space! Get out, move back! Everybody out! If you have nothing to do here, out! Light! If he makes it, it's a miracle. There. I did what I could. Now I've treated your friend, take me back to the hospital, will you? Yes. We can go. You want to see me go, I'm gone. I'm gone. Gone! Too bad. Fuck it. Hazia! Hello. - Hello, doctor. - How are you feeling? Ok? Who's this guy? What are you doing? Stop! Get out. Come on, move it. You guys always... Engine off. What's going on? Move it, I said. Shut up! Every time, I get searched. Every time, yes. - Security. What are you doing here? - My mother's sick. Ok, I'm clean. Not so fast. You talk a lot. - You guys... - Why do you talk? You always do this. Always. - There's nothing there. - Open it. There's nothing. C'mon, pull him! Drag him. Pull! Doctor! It's an emergency! A bullet. We got shot at! - What's going on? - He took a bullet! - He got shot. - Pull him in here. - A gurney! - Get a gurney, fast! How's his pulse doing? 93. 90. I can't get it. Well, doc? What's going on? You can inform his mother. Have a good day. - Thank you, doctor. - Goodbye. Yes, come in. - You wanted to see me? - Where did you go? I told you I had no explanation. That's not good enough. Nothing... Nothing gets to you. You're a soft mush. I don't want to keep on in my department people that are so... neutral. Disengaged. I made my apologies. No, you're fired. Don't let me see you again. Come in! Be quiet! - Gentlemen... - Do it. - Doctor Zy? - Yes. Stand up, please. You are under arrest. Follow us. I don't understand, I... Leave that here. Where are you taking me? Afternoon, sir. I have patients! Leave me alone. Take it easy, dammit! Slow down! I didn't do anything wrong. Come on... - Say white. - White. White! Louder! White! Louder! White. Faster! White, come on. That's better. - What do cows drink? - Milk. Milk! Very good. Know where you are? In hell. Absolutely. And we are the law. Here, the State is us. We are in power, alright? Not your school teacher, alright? So my advice is to talk. - Where did you go the last few days? - I... - Sorry? - I told you. No, you told me nothing. - I was kidnapped from the hospital. - Louder. I can't hear you. I was kidnapped from the hospital. They put a hood over my face and took me away. - Bullshit! - They took me... - No bullshit. Who is power here? - You. - Who is power? - You. - Louder! Who is power? - You. Alright. We know everything, son. Your editor friend? We bumped him off, get it? That's right, nice and easy. You think this is a free country? Why do you think your wife split? Yeah, that's right. From the top, alright? Where did you go the last few days? - Yeah? - I was kidnapped from the hospital. We know everything, I said. We know everything! Stop! They took me into the forest outside town. - Who was it? Who was your patient? - I don't know. - Who was he? - I don't know. - Talk. We'll cut off your balls. - I swear. We'll cut off your balls, son. Listen to me, look at me. Who did you treat? Who was the guy you treated? - I can tell you... - Yeah? To them, he was a saint. Really? A saint? Listen very carefully, alright? Look at me, dammit! You treat our enemies and you expect us to leave you alone? You expect us to leave you alone? I didn't know. Don't sob, fucker! You expect us to leave you alone? We'll cut off your balls, son. I don't know. I'm a doctor, dammit! Look at me. Quit sobbing! That's right. I'm a doctor. Yeah, you're a doctor. You're a dickwad doctor! Here, we have real doctors. Real doctors. Doctors who bring the dead to life. Alright? Take it easy. There you go. Look at me. So what you did, you think it was your duty, right? I'm a doctor. Your father was in the Resistance? Tortured by the French, wasn't he? - You're worse than them. - Are we? Who got more torture, you or your dad? Who do you think? - I don't know. - You don't know? You see... I'm your God here. I'm your God here. - Leave me alone. - I'm your God here. Say it. You're my God here. - I'm your God. - You're my God here. So if we ever hear your name again... we'll break every funny bone in your body. Got it? You're a funny guy. And next time... we'll give you the worst, the worst atrocities. You. And your family. You heard me. Thanks. Thanks, Charlie. - Need anything? - No. - No money? - No. - Sure. - Positive. I'll be as fast as I can and I'll be back. Thanks for everything. Thanks. Doc, ready? That's right, it's cooked. Eggs again. - You're looking better. - Yeah? I guess there's no dessert. No cheese and no dessert. I left school at 16. Like lots of kids. - If you don't want to tell me, don't. - It's no big deal. Then I worked here and there. A bit of this, some of that. How did you become... a smuggler? Like I had much choice. I worked at the port. - As a docker? - Yeah, docker. Merchandise came in, went out. So you get into... Then you stashed me. Then I stashed you. Obviously. No, not obviously. Sure, it is. No, it's not. I got very lucky. Yeah, but you'd have done the same. Yeah. Without the eggs afterward. They're all I had. I had no choice. - Thanks, Charlie. - No problem. I'll clear up. No, I'll do it later. Alright. Go get some rest. It feels like you're an angel, Moh. Yes. An angel. You're our angel. I know the captain of a tanker. - He'll stow you away. - A tanker's great. Looks like we got a tail. There's a piece in the glovebox. Faster, Moh. Faster. I'll take you to the boat. - Fuck, what did I do? - Calm down. - What did I just do, Moh? - Calm down. - Calm down, doc. - I shot them. I fucking shot them! You did what you fucking had to! - Calm down. - They're dead. They nearly killed you first. There's a passport in there, alright? A fake better than the real thing. There's a boat waiting for you. I'll take you to the port. Calm down. Just keep calm. Leave everything to me. Calm down! Adaptation: Simon John Subtitling Cineli Digital
