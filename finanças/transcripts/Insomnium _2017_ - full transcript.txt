(Foreign Language) (Foreign Language) That mountain came out of nowhere. Shut up dude. It's not funny. Kim, if it's not funny, why are you smiling? This ain't working. Okay. So, stand up. Fin? What are you doing? Put your arm around me, come on. Oh Christ. Stand up now. On the count of three, I want you to hop. One, two, three. Okay. Okay. Watch the leg. Okay. Alright. Thanks. Thanks, babe. Yeah. Here's good. Yeah, oh, let me help. Alright, there we go. Home sweet home. Guys, I'm sorry about all this. It's a real trip. It's alright man. Now we get to make fun of you for the rest of your life. Yeah. Hey, where's that bottle of wine? No more vicodin for this guy. It's a life giving bottle. Really at it's best, I'm sure. It's so sweet. Phin said the sweetest thing today. We were making love, you remember this? Nah. He had his face in the pillow and he turns to me and he goes, you know George, I just thought how sweet it was.. Okay, everybody clear their minds. If I get like a huge boner right now, should I just suppress it or let it flow? It's not gonna work if you're like this. Everybody has to focus on shit or it's not gonna happen. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just so fucking romantic in here right now. You don't really believe in this shit, do you? I played it three times with my cousin. It worked like twice. What happened? I don't want, I don't want to talk about it. Come on. It's probably not even freaky anyways. Probably lamest thing I've ever heard. You know what, I don't even want to hear it. I'm sure it's boring as shit. If I tell you guys, you'll totally chicken out. Go ahead. I was staying with my cousin Becca in New York. And we hang out every night, had friends over and stuff. And there was this one guy, Davy, that I made out with a couple of times. But by this point, he was freaking me out. He comes over really early and we don't know what to do with him. And she comes up with a brilliant idea of let's do a bunch of shots and play Ouija. The weird thing was that every time Davy touched the planchet. Wait, what's a planchet? This. Oh. Okay, go on. And it just starts freaking out. And then it starts flying to the nine, to the one, to the five over and over again. Nine, one, five. Becca goes and she starts fixing her makeup and the buzzer rings. It's time to go so I let Becca know this and when she walks out of her room, she is as white as a ghost. And I shit you not, it is 9:15. Oh my god, I just got the chills. Look at my arms. Okay, I have the strangest suspicion that I've actually heard this story before. It's weird is people always ignore the first part of the coincidence. They focus on the second part. Okay, what, what he's talking about? What time were your friends supposed to show? When you were playing the game, what time were they supposed to show to your house? Maybe around nine o'clock we were going out, but Right, exactly. it has nothing to do with. They got their what, at 9:15. Oh. 15 minutes late. If you were to put money down, what time somebody was gonna show, if they were supposed to be there at nine, you would say 9:15. Dude, you're a buzzkill. And as for the first part, you guys subconsciously put your focus on the nine, one, five. Nine, one, five, because you knew something different was gonna happen. Is that your theory? Uh huh. It's not what happened. I'm starting to like this idea. I mean come on, my grandma went batshit before she died, like hid all of her jewelry and shit. She seriously thought like the communists were coming to get her. I mean come on, I'm in for the money. Let's fucking do this. Okay. Okay. You sure? Well, yeah. Okay. Here we go. Okay, let's do it. Everybody, clear your heads. Big money, let's go. Now just put one of your hands on the board really lightly and hello. Is there anyone out there? Grandma, where's your necklace? Is there anyone that wants to communicate? This is bullshit. Shh. Jesus Christ. I'm nervous, I'm sorry. It's okay. It's supposed to move. There's, um... there's definitely an energy. Who was that? Was that you, Phin? Phin, you moved it. You moved it. I swear. Who's S-R? Anybody know an S-R, R-S? My grandma. No, he's.. Jesus. You met her. She made you those socks. Oh my god. I think we need to clear the board. It's spelling hash. No, no, no, it's Shala.. George don't. What. Shala.. Yeah, done. No, no, hold up. Hold up. Hold up. No, dude, you're on your own on this one. Phin. Phin. Phin. Phin. Oh my god, Phin. That's not funny. Come on. He's had a lot to drink. Something happened to him, Phin. Phin. Phin stop dicking around. Hey. Babe, will you get rid of the game? Fuck yeah. Olivia, just put on a movie. A funny movie. Something to clear the air, please. Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah, a funny movie. Phin. Phin. Jesus. Wake up Phin. Phineas. That's wrong. Hey. Since when did you start smoking in bed? Since I can't walk to the porch. Well then maybe you should quit. I can try it. Yeah. She's in there with him. Why, he fell asleep. While I was getting you situated, she took him into his room and I heard them laughing. I think she likes him. What? It's exciting. You're right, it is. How you doing? Still scared? Scared? No. I mean it was really, really weird. Yeah, I know. I don't know. But hey, you know what was super, super sexy? When Phin passed out, and everybody freaked out and you were like "Kimmy, put the game away. "Olivia, put a funny movie on." Put Top Secret on. Yeah. Yeah. I bet you're gonna make regional manager in like five years. Kim. Come on, don't say that. Don't ever say that. No, since when did you get so bossy? I'm not bossy, I'm just crabby, that's all. You're Mr. Crabby. Kimmy. What? You don't have the do anything. I'm just tired. Don't worry. I will be very, very gentle. I mean it's good, it's okay. Oh, come on. Babe. Kai said I would have amazing orgasms this week. Oh wow, you know what, then why don't you go give Kai, the psychic, a booty call because I'm Mr. Gimp and I'm going to sleep. Fine. Bite off my head because I want to do it. Come here, come here, just No. Poo bear, come here. I'm sorry. Okay. Come here. There. Hey. George. Huh? Wake up. Wake up. Okay. What? What the fuck? What's going on? Come in, come in. Kimmy, I'm sorry. Can I have a ride home? Okay, what happened? I just need a ride home, please, okay? Thanks. Alright. What the fuck did he do? I don't know. Hey. I'm so sorry. No, no, no, listen, I don't know what's going on, but I am way too nervy to drive. So why don't you just take my car. I'll get it from you tomorrow. Thank you so much. I just, I don't know if he's trying to be funny or what, but I just need to get out of here. I need to get to my dogs. I just gotta go. Okay. Okay. I know he's not really himself tonight. Will you just text me when you get home? Call me, I don't care. Yeah. You promise? Okay. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey, cock state, wake up. It's like summer break. What? I hope you don't mind, I borrowed one of your pills. Oh, great. Fantastic. Yeah, dude. This is awesome. You got all this time off. You getting paid for this, right? Like it's a free vacation? I don't know man. I haven't figured it out yet. Yeah well, it's like one o'clock already. You slept later than me today. Yeah, well I'm tired. You need anything? Want some food or you want to move into the living room? No, not yet. What did you do last night, Phin? What didn't I do? I did all sorts of stuff with that girl last night. No, I mean after that. Oh. I went to bed. Woke up this morning, took a shower, smoked a bowl and came in here. No, I mean what did you do to Olivia, Phin? Besides eating her pink taco, I didn't do shit. Well she woke up in the middle of the night freaked out, screaming. Okay, you did something to her. Maybe I fucking drooled on her. I don't know. Dammit Phin, you really spooked her man. What do you want me to say? I mean I don't remember anything. You fucked up. What is that? It's Kim calling me. Just shut up. Big girlfriend. Shut up. Stop. Big girlfriend in the fucking sky. Hey babe. Hi honey. You have everything you need? Yeah, I'm just trying to finally wake up. Okay, well, just relax babe. I'm gonna try to get out of here early and get over to you. There's something I want to talk to you about. Okay. Oh, too rough. Oh, come on guys. What if Dan saw? I gotta go. Idiots. God, she's already pissy for last night, Phin. Why do you gotta push all the time? Man, your grumpy when you're injured. You're like an old man. I'm three months younger than you, dick hole. Hold on, I got something that'll make you feel better. No. Dig in. No, it's too early for that. Come on man, you got a busted leg. It's medicine, it'll make you feel better. Okay. Don't take it like a puss either. Smoke it. I'll write you a little song while we're in here. Yep. Alright. Hey guys. I have Chinese food. Gross. Hey. Hey. I organized your plates. Organized my plates? Thanks. Thank you. Is he asleep? Yeah, I think so. So, um, Dan asked me today if I wanted to go to this conference thing in Vegas. But the thing is I would have to leave on Thursday and I told him that I would ask you first, and get back to him tomorrow. Yeah, no. You should go. You should go. You wanted to go. Yeah, but that was before you got hurt. I'm fine. Phin doesn't do anything. He'll take care of me. I'm fine. Are you sure? Uh huh. Okay, because Dan said that this would be a great opportunity to get in good with Fielding, and you know that I've been trying to get.. I totally get it. Fielding, he's, it's great. It's great. It's the greatest thing ever. Okay. I knew you'd be wonderful about it. Now, one more favor? Uh huh. Let me take you into your room. And let me have my way with you. Cause you owe me from last night. I do. But I'm scared. You should be. I have to go to the bathroom. No. Stop it you lunatic. I have to pee. Hurry up woman. Alright, you just watch out. I'm watching that behind. George? Hello? Hello? George, George. George, oh my god. Does he think he's being funny? Phin is fucking crazy. Kim, Kim, go to back to bed. Kim, go back to bed. Do something. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll call you if I need you. Go back to bed. Okay. Hey. Phineas, hey. Hey man. What the fuck? I got this fucking thing in my hand, I'm gonna throw it at your goddamn face, now wake up. One. Two. Phin. Phinny. Dude, turn the fucking light off. Christ. Okay. Okay, man. (Foreign Language) Liar, liar, liar. (Foreign Language) Liar. Liar. Liar. Boo. Oh fuck me man. What the fuck's wrong with you? It's not funny man. That was awesome. No, it's not awesome. You know what dude, first of all, okay, you scared the shit out of Kim last night. I mean whatever you're doing, sleepwalking, it's fucking weird. It's just weird. Maybe that's why I woke up in the tub. What have you been on man? Seriously, besides pot, booze, mushrooms, ecstasy, what? No, I did have this crazy ass dream though. I was like sitting there and my mom, she left me with my nanny, which is kind of weird cause I never had a nanny. Stop, Phin, stop. Just first of all, stop fucking saying nanny, please. Okay. So anyway nanny is sitting there nannying the shit out of me in nannyland. She falls asleep, and I look up and there's this like white bird sitting on the windowsill. It's got something like tied around its foot. So I go to try to figure out what it is. And I'm sitting there, and I follow it out, and it leads me to this old theater. And I see my mom walking in. I'm like, oh wow. So I sit there and I'm waiting for her. And all I'm doing is I keep writing the word fly in the dirt over and over and over again. Wow, Phin. That's great, that's fucking exciting. I see my mom walk out and she's with some dude. And this guy's, I mean he's not my dad. I mean it's just like some smooth looking son of a bitch. So I'm like pissed. And I get home and I get to the kitchen. My parents are like going at it, like fighting. And my mom turns to me and she like where the hell have you been. And I get so mad, like I just get this overwhelming feeling. I look over and there's this pair of scissors sitting on the table. I get so mad I like grab the scissors and go right at her. And all of a sudden, there's this like crazy burst of like electrical energy. And everything goes fucking red. That is pretty fucked up. Thank you. That's why I had to tell you. Wow, thanks. You're welcome. What the fuck have you been on? Fuck you dude, I'm not on, weed. Okay. It's the same shit I get from the pharmacy every week. That's it? That's it. Do me a favor, 24 hours, don't do it. Let's just see what happens. If I don't smoke weed, I can't sleep. Perfect. That's great. Because it's when you're sleeping we have the problem. It took me three hours to calm Kim down last night. She seriously thinking about not going to the conference in Vegas. And I know you don't want her to not, just stop. Okay. 24 hours. Just one night. Fine. Whatever. Thanks. The yard looks good. How's life? Oh, I've been having strange dreams lately. Dreams? It's nice to be young. Yeah. Hey, do you ever think about having just like a couple people over tonight just for some drinks? Not too loud on the base. Oh no, not at all. Yeah. We'll totally take care of that. I'm just gonna go grab some stuff. But let me know if we get too loud. I'll see you later. Thanks again for the light. See ya. Now, come on. Thank you God. Babe, fuck. Babe get up. Get up. You're late, you're late. Get up. What time is it? It's 9:30. Oh shit. Are you serious? Yeah, come on. Oh my god, I told Joelle I would meet her at 9:30. Shit. She's gonna drive me to the airport. I have to be there super early. You know Dan wants us there by five. It's ridiculous. Where's my phone? It's right here. Where? Thank you. What's with all the music? It's Phin. I told him he could have some people over, okay. Okay, why? To celebrate my leaving? No, no, because I asked him not to smoke pot for 24 hours to see if that works. It's sort of a no pot for a party exchange. Okay, way to be proactive. Are you kidding? Getting Phin not to smoke for 24 hours. It's a fete in itself. Amazing. Yeah, amazing. You know, just make sure that he sees someone because there was something seriously wrong with him. Okay I get it. I mean if I have to come back here after a five day business trip, I.. I understand. I got it, I got it. Okay. Okay? I have to go. Now come back here. No, no, you're freezing. No. Please, one more. I have to go. I'm already late. Okay, George, here. I'm going to rock your balls and cock off completely out of your pants. Here. Get ready for greatness. Okay, here we go. Football's coming at your fat fingers. Oh. Fuck. That was good man. That was actually really good. Pretty good. We don't even have football. Good job, Dre. I need to ask you one question. I'll ask you a question. George, where are the fucking pretzels, huh? I'm pretzel less. But can I ask you a question real quick? Okay. Do you know anything about sleepwalking? Sleepwalking, yeah. My sister, Mona, used to sleepwalk when we were kids. She would stand at the foots of the bunk beds here and just scare all the shits out of them. I'm really hungry, George. Like I could eat the whole fucking fat buffalo. But when she was, did she ever look into your eyes, you know what I mean, when she was sleeping, did she ever look right into your eyes? No, no, look if you're asleep, there's no looking. You're look like this. You know. She's like that? Yeah. There's no looking. You're sleeping and not looking. Oh. Yeah that's weird. What the fuck? Hey, you pussies come inside. The girls want to give us manicures. Yeah. Uno memento. Oh fuck Phin. One night. George, wait. Oh shit. Hold on, I'll be back. George wait. Unbelievable. George, hey, come on man look, okay, I'm not smoking my weed. This is her weed. I smoked her weed, that's it. It's not the point Phin. The point is I'm trying to help you. So you throw parties, screw up my last night with Kim, and you go ahead and fucking smoke anyways. Dude, look, I have a little insomnia, okay. Who cares. Why would you care, Phin? Alright, look, I'm sorry okay. I got drunk. I made a bad decision, alright. Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm sorry for giving a fuck. Dude, don't fucking be like that. No. You're on your own now pal. You know you actually used to be fucking fun. You remember those days. How about that for fun, Phin? You're a fucking prick, you know that. I'm going to bed. Close the door. Hey babe, Vegas. You got there okay? How was the flight? What's under your nails? Nothing? What's that? Look, okay. I know we haven't discussed it because something always comes up, but have you given any consideration to what we were talking about? I mean if we keep putting it off.. You hear that? Hear what? Will you please pay attention to me? Yeah, no, I'm sorry. I'm just, just the morning, I need some coffee. The morning. So. So? Oh my god, what is wrong with you? I just, I just need some more time that's all. Okay, how much more time do you need? Another 15 months? Just some time. Can we talk about this when you get back? Fuck, do you hear that? Okay, okay fine. But we're actually going to have a conversation about it okay, so I would appreciate some serious consideration. Okay? You got it. Okay. I'll call you later. Why are you acting like such a fucking space cadet? I'm sorry. I just. Kim, you ready? My film is in 20 minutes. Yeah, just a second, Dan. Sorry. I'm sorry for jumping down your throat. It's just I have been super crabby and so stressed out. And Fielding was here early today and I.. Kim, come on. Let's hustle. Okay. I get it. Go to Dan. It's fine. Go have fun. We'll just talk about, I'm gonna call you back in a little bit. Okay. Alright, I'll talk to you later then. Adios. Love you, bye. Okay, bye. (Foreign Language) What the fuck? Phin? Phin? Wake up. Hey man, wake up. Phin? (Foreign Language) Ow. What the fuck? What the fuck? What is this shit? You tell me buddy. Get me out of this fucking thing. What are you doing? Christ. Fuck. What's wrong with you? You need to see somebody Phin. I can't afford to. Not all of us have nice little jobs that provide us with great insurance. Man, I'm tired as shit. Because you're up all night acting like a freak instead of sleeping. And it's weird and creepy, and starting to get very annoying. Well I didn't smoke weed at all yesterday, so that blows that theory. Maybe you should just lock me in my room, that way I'd quit bothering you. Great. Great. That's great. You don't want to fix it man, huh. You want to figure this out? Do you have any suggestions? I would gladly listen to them right now. Dude, this ain't never gonna work. Yes it will. They don't give a shit. Social? Huh? Social? Social security card, ID, insurance card. Any questions, I'm sitting right here. Hey, did you check out the tits on the receptionist? No. No, I didn't. What the fuck is with this music? I don't know. I like it. Birth date? What? Birth date? We've been friends since high school, you don't know my birthday? I'm a guy. I don't remember birthdays. When's my birthday smart man? November fourth. Yeah, well you're gay. George. George. George. Oh, I am. That's me. Oh man. It feels good to finally get out of the house. If I'd known this would have worked, I'd have gotten that ingrown toenail taken care of last year. Well, here goes nothing. Dude, you think that's a good idea taking that with beer? I don't know. All I know is I'm tired as fuck. I can't get that receptionist's tits out of my mind. You know, maybe we're just like talking about this too much. I mean just making it a bigger deal that what it is. And that's all I ever think about anymore is sleeping or not sleeping. And that's all we ever talk about. So let's just shut up about it. Yeah, fine. I won't say anything else. The other night, when you were doing the scratching thing, I didn't want to bring this up, but you said something. Yeah, what? I don't know. But you were pissed off about something. It was in a different language. I don't know what it means. Dude, I'm monolingual. Whatever it was, it was fucking freaky, okay. And all of.. What did I just say? Okay. I'm tired of talking about this shit all the time. Come on man. Can we focus on something else like pussy or anything? Yeah, great, fine. But you're the one who's talking in fucking tongues. Hey babe, I was just about to call you. You were? That's hilarious. Yeah, I'm gonna talk to Phin tomorrow, promise. Why bother? What? We should all live together, forever. Just the three of us. You, me, and Phin forever. It'll be cute. You know what Kim, you're being a little mean drunk, so I'm gonna hang up the phone right now. And you know what, Dan told me not to tell you this, but I can't lie to you and not tell you would be lying. Dan? Yeah, Dan was here. You know I won 3,000 bucks on the freaking slots in between freaking calls to you. Answer your phone. Check your fucking computer for once, really. Anyway, Vanna from marketing comes down with these like crazy shots. We started dancing and I got wasted. And I sort of, you know made out with someone. Who was it? I don't know. Who cares, I was drunk. I care. Who the fuck was it? George, George, you know what, I can't. I can't. I can't. You know what. We can talk about it tomorrow. No, no, no, no. We can fucking talk about this right now. No. No. Because you're in a fucking cast and you can't do anything. And I go to Vegas and have a fucking meltdown and you don't answer my goddamn phone calls. So see how you like it. God dammit. (Foreign Language) Get the fuck off me. George, what, what did I do? I lost her man. Fuck. She's gone. I'm sorry. Fuck, I didn't know man. If it makes you feel any better, my ex-fiance has the fucking.. How the fuck can you compare that right now? Like you cared about Kim more than I did her just like fucking grown ups? No. No. It was four years ago, man. Remember. It was just some fucking singer. Some fucking singer who fucked both of us over. Where you going? That's good stuff man. Come on man, you just lost your girl. I'm a fucking zombie. And we're both laying on the goddam floor. I am sorry about Kim. I really am. Your up. Thanks. George. George, Georgie. Try to keep her from getting. You just can't use your.. He has a broken arm and leg and a lot of other stuff going on. Can you blame him? Give him a break. When's he coming back anyways? Why don't you come to my office? I got a package for you to sign. Shh, don't. Get out of here. Relax sexy. You don't see him. But I can still hear you, you douche. Georgie, I am so sorry. What was that? Just. What? Shut up. Shit. Look, I know you're in there. I just want to talk. Please, Georgie. I went to Vegas. I panicked. I got drunk and I made a mistake. I'm so, so sorry. But it's not like I'm into Dan. It was just sex. Georgie, come on. Fine. I'm leaving. Just text me, or call me, or something. Organize this bitch. And then the thour buff, the clouds she waited all alone, day after day, hour after hour for the prince to rescue her as he had promised. And then one day, a white bird flew into her window and perched itself atop of her mirror. At first she tried to scare it away until she noticed a small scrap of paper tied to it's leg. There written in gold letters was just one word, fly. She looked out the window, through the clouds, around the low, but all she could see was George. Hey, you're walking. Yeah, I'm sorry. We heard some sounds downstairs. Da da da. I fall down. No big deal. It's okay. George, it's late. Please, go to bed. Yeah. Have a good night. I got it. I'm not a charity case. How was therapy, George? It sucks. It's therapy. Yeah. It's painful. Yeah. Thanks for the ride, man. I appreciate it. Whatever man, no problem. It's interesting, the whole. It's really nice of you. Like it's actually interesting. Wait two second. Where are you going? Just a second. No, I will be home soon. I gotta ask you a question. Please. I'm sorry, I don't mean to bother you. The other day, you were arguing with my landlord. I just want to know. Da, from Russia, near my town. Big shot doctor. Wife disappeared. Police investigate. Suddenly they are both gone. They, who do you mean they? Who's they? Both of them. No, no, no, no, that doesn't make sense. You said that the wife died, but Mr. Romanovsky. He means the doctor and who else, the children maybe? No, doctor and daughter. They. You mean Mr. Romanovsky. Da. Romanov. Very rude. I give my regards to his family. Very nice. He say I have no family. You make mistake. I say how is little Sophie. He say mind your business. Very rude. Now, I must go. Victor needs his cream. Wait, one more question. Let her go. Come on. God dammit. See, now you hurt yourself. No, I fine. No, I'm good. What was that all about? He Phin, wake up. Darn it, wake up. Hey. What? I just found out some crazy shit. Romanovsky used to be a doctor in Russia with a beautiful wife and daughter. And they just disappeared. Romanovsky doesn't have a family. I know. That's my point. Where'd they go? Man, Romanovsky's awesome. Phin. You've been speaking Russian in your sleep. The whole neighborhood speaks Russian. You went to one sleep specialist and you bailed. I've been helping you out for weeks now. You can indulge me in this one thing. God, alright. Fuck. What do you want? I'm gonna sneak up stairs. I'm gonna look around and see if I can find anything. Okay. I need you to be awake by noon. Okay. Get me some coffee. Okay. Wake up. I bookmarked a page for you. It's gross. Fuck. Sorry. Sorry. It's the only thing that works. Dammit. Here. Sit right here. Just, now just wake up. I wouldn't have to use it all the time. Shit man. Now just keep playing. Phineas, play that loud. Okay. Don't stop playing. I got it, alright. My fucking fingers hurt. My face hurts. What is that? Speed? I gotta stay up somehow. Hey, Mr. Romanovsky. Sorry to bother you. We're having a little problem with the kitchen sink. What happened? I don't know. Just started leaking. Just started leaking. Yeah, just started leaking. (Foreign Language) If something breaks, just call. Don't fix. You only make worse. I'm sorry, Mr. Romanovsky. That's my fault. I thought I could just wrench it back together. I go get part. Be back. Alright man, listen. He's gonna be at the store for an hour. Keep playing. Unless you see him, keep playing. Hello. Oh dear god. What's he doing to you? Dammit. Phin. What? Sophie, she's fucking hooked up to something. She's up there right now in a coma. I think she just woke up. That's great. Dude, Phin, she hummed your song. The song you've been playing over and over and over again. She heard it. Dude, she's in a fucking coma or not. I don't fucking know what she's in. But here's what I think man. I think that she's trying to reach you in her sleep. We've got to do something. Dude, she's sick. Romanovsky is awesome. Will you please go on, crazy. I just want to take a fucking nap. Dude, Phin I'm trying to fucking help you. She is up there right now. Fuck. Perfect. Shit. Holy shit. What? What? SR. I don't get it. SR from the Ouija thing. Oh shit. Yes, this is George Fishburn. Yes, this is a person of very significant importancy. Hi. I'm an anonymous man. Hi, I'm a suspect. I know of certain things my landlord. This is George Fishburn. I live downstairs from a man. He took his daughter. I'd like to report. Hi, my name is George. My name is George Fishburn. I know about suspicious activities. George. Sorry. It's so early. It's kind of important though. No, no, please come in. I'll make us coffee. Thanks, thanks. Shit. Yeah. He hasn't been sleeping at all. No. I knew something happened. Yeah, and that's why I came over. I was gonna bring the devil board. No, George. That thing is stupid. It just opened a window. What you're looking for is more of a doorway. Doorway? What do you mean doorway?
