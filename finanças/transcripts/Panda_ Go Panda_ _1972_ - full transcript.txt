Mama, Mama My Mama with her flowers Papa, Papa My Papa with his pipe Let's have a chat with the tiny giggling ants Because we get along and have fun laughing together! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Hurry Grandma! The train's coming! Coming. Here, this is your ticket to Nagasaki. And this is your lunch. Don't get mixed up, now. I sure hope you'll be okay on your own, Mimiko. Who, me? I'll be fine. Anyway, I've got school so there's no choice. No. I just can't go. Grandpa's memorial service is important. But I just can't leave you alone. Grandma! You're such a worry wart! You have to get on! Don't worry, I'll write a letter every day. Okay? There. See you later! Mimiko! Make sure you write me every day! Don't worry, I'll be fine! See? Hello, Mimiko. - Where's your Grandma? - She just left. I'd like some apples, onions and potatoes, please. Sure. That means you'll be all alone from tonight. No problem! I can do the cooking, cleaning and the wash! What a good little girl. Mimiko doesn't have a father or mother. But she doesn't seem lonely! Aren't you gonna get scared and cry, being alone at night? I'll be just fine! If I see a ghost, then... I'll beat him up and make him my servant! You sure are full of energy, Mimi. Here, this one is on the house. Thank you! What a good little girl. In actual fact, it's she who takes care of Grandma. Mimi, I hear you're on your own for a while. That's no good. - What if a burglar gets in your house? - Oh, that'd be great! I've never seen a burglar before! You got me there! Hey... that's weird. It wasn't like this when I left. Wonder if it's a burglar? Oh, boy. Somebody was definitely here while I was out. I'm sure this bucket was put away properly before. Oh, boy! A cute stuffed panda! I'm positive you and I are gonna be friends! My very first visitor is a panda! Go on in. Wait here, and I'll get us some drinks! Ups-a-daisy! There you are. What a cute way to drink! Daddy! Daddy! I don't see anybody. Oh, someone's here. Hang on a second. Come in! Thank you, I will. What a nice house. The weather's nice too. And the bamboo grove is especially nice. I've come to see if my panda son is here. I thought so! So you're the panda's father! Come in! - I've just made drinks! - Please don't trouble yourself. I guess this seat really didn't like being sat upon. I'm sure this seat will want you to sit on it! Now this is a nice seat! The kitchen is nice, too. And the bamboo grove is especially nice! Which reminds me... I should say hello to your parents. No need to do that. Because I don't have a mom or dad! You don't have a dad? That won't do! But I'm just fine! I can get along on my own! No siree. In order to raise children, there have to be parents. Like you need a bamboo grove to grow bamboo shoots. It'd probably be better to have them. What a nice bamboo grove! I know! Why don't I become your father? It's hard for a father to become a mother! But it's easy to become a father! Nothing to it! I'm already a dad. So it'd be nothing for me to become a father! I'd like even just one father! Mr. Panda! Be my father! And in turn, I'll be Panny's mommy! Okay? Then the three of us will live here in this house! Mommy! Oh, boy! That's nice of you. Panny's always wanted a mom. Daddy! Yes? Daddies wear a hat, you know! And daddies read a newspaper in the room. And they smoke a pipe. Thank you... You're very welcome! And daddies... Daddies give hugs, too... Okay! Daddy! Yes, little girl. That's weird, calling me "little girl". Call me "Mimiko". Mimiko. Daddy. Mommy. What is it, Panny? Mom's right here. Isn't this nice. It truly is. And the bamboo grove is especially nice! The bamboo grove? I see! What a nice bamboo grove. Yes, I'm coming. Got one! Mine, too! Very nice! Is it good? This is so great! It's the happiest day of my life! Standing on your head when you're happy. That's truly a fun thing to do. "Dear Grandma. How are you? I'm doing great. Because something really terrific happened. I got myself a daddy! And I also got a baby. Right now Daddy's reading a picture book upside-down, while he eats some bamboo. Panny's fallen asleep. I'll have to get his bed ready. Well, I'd better get going. Being a mother is wonderful, and it keeps you so busy! Take care. Bye, Grandma. Love from your Granddaughter, Mimiko." Panny! Breakfast is almost ready, so don't go too far! Get up, Daddy. Hurry or you'll be late for work! Work? Eat up! All right, then. Here's your lunch, Dad. And this is your lunch. My lunch! My lunch! Your hat, Dad! Here! Language, math... When you say "Dad has to go to work", are you talking to me? Sure! Dads go to work every morning! Daddy! I wanna go to work, too! Dad's going to work? Work? That's right! How could I have forgotten? Today's a day off! I'm sure of it! Yes, that's right! It's always a day off! - So I don't have to go to work! - A day off! Let's go! Let's go for a walk! We can't! I've gotta go to school. No! I wanna go to school, too! Don't be like that, or I'll spank your bottom. I don't wanna be spanked. Be a good boy. See you later! Bye! Have a good day! Panny, did you follow me? You can't come! Get back home! You've gotta be bigger to go to school. You can't come! School's about to start! Oh, brother. In that case... Listen, Panny. Act like a stuffed animal. I'll take you if you promise not to be naughty. Okay. I'm a stuffed animal. "And after a little while, another tiger appeared." "The tiger said, I'll eat you up!" Mimi, your stuffed panda sure is cute! Let me hold it for a while. No. Stingy! Just for a minute! Please! Let me see! No! What did you bring a stuffed animal for? I'm telling the teacher! Mimiko! Yes? Stand up! Mimiko, what are you hiding behind the book? A stuffed panda! Isn't it cute? What a well-made panda. You shouldn't be bringing stuffed animals to class! Now, get rid of it! But... Put it in the shoe locker until school is out. Understand? Yes. Okay, Panny. Stay here and be quiet. I'll come to get you as soon as school's out. Okay, I'll be right here. Don't be naughty! I won't be naughty. "Bread". Oh, dear! You didn't put it away properly! Now all this bread has gone to waste! What's a rice cake doing in here? What? A bear! Class is over. Oh, no! That's Panny! A bear! Catch it! Mommy! Mimi! Did a bear come this way? Look, teacher! I washed my panda off; isn't it nice and clean? No, not a panda! A bear! A yellow bear! Oh, it went that way. "And of course, Grandma, when we got home, I scrubbed him clean. Because he smelled like curry. He was a curry panda. Of course, I had to scold him. It sure is hard, having a small child. Take care now." Where are you off to, Mr. Policeman? Hello. I thought I'd go check in on Mimi. Grandma isn't back yet, is she? No, and I'm worried about Mimi being on her own. See you later. Hello, Mimi. It's unlocked! Hello! We have a guest, so stay over there. What was that? Dad and Panny. "Dad"? Yes? Did you call for Papa? Boy, what a rude policeman. He was surprised that I have a dad! Hurry and let's go for a walk! All right, let's go! That's strange. I'm sure there was a great big panda and a little one. A panda and its child were here, right? Hello, Mr. Zookeeper. It was definitely Papa panda and his family! Hurry and catch them! I've been so worried about them for the last few days... ever since they escaped from our zoo! Yes, I've heard all about it in the paper and on TV. But who would've thought they'd be in Mimi's house... I'm counting on you! It's beautiful! This air is delicious! This pipe is delicious! Daddy! Come and skip! Oh, a skipping rope! Come on! Hey, pandas! Must be the ones that escaped from the zoo! I won't let you say bad things about my dad! Even my dad's dumb! That's the famous panda that escaped from the zoo! Don't you have a TV at home? Whoever catches them will get a reward! Daddy... Hey, hurry and go tell the cops. I ll guard them! But I wanted to keep skipping. No, stop! Look out, Panny! Panny! I'm giving him back. You're so strong, Panny! Dad? What's a zoo? It's a place we were in a long, long time ago. But they didn't have a nice bamboo grove. And you weren't there. But when they come to take you back, they'll take Panny, too. Oh, where did Panny get to? Panny! Where are you? Hello, Papa Panda. Lovely day. And I'm delighted to see you looking so well! And I'm delighted to see you so well, Mr. Zookeeper. I'd like your cooperation in accompanying us back to the zoo. We have the car already. How kind of you. Then you'll come back? No. Dad! We've gotta look for Panny! That's true. You'll have to excuse me. "Panny"? The baby panda! Everyone look for the panda! Panny! We've been looking and looking. Where could he be? HHe's over there! Oh, no! There's a floodgate ahead! A what? We've gotta move! Panny! Daddy! Mommy! Hang on tight! No use! It's rusted and won't budge! No, don't! Let me go! You'll get killed, too! Mimi! Hang on! Daddy! Coming! Hurry, Dad! I can't hold on! It's all over! Hooray! Isn't that nice! "Dear Grandma. How are you? Dad and Panny have gone back to the zoo." PANDA GARDEN ENTRANCE Good night. See you tomorrow. "Dad's very happy going to work. After all, Dads are supposed to go to work. Dad buys me presents with the money he makes. Anyway, I'm very happy, so don't worry." Dad! Welcome back! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Mama, Mama My tiny, tiny Mama Papa, Papa My great big, great big Papa Let's stand on our heads Let's smile and laugh Because the three of us are together and it's fun! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Mama, Mama My Mama with her flowers Papa, Papa My Papa with his pipe Let's have a chat with the tiny giggling ants Because we get along and have fun laughing together! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! Panda! Papa Panda! Baby Panda! "Dear Grandma. How are you? Dad, Panny and I are all doing very well! That's because we met some terrific people! Who do you think it was, Grandma?" It's inside this house! Seems like nobody's home. No matter! Let's hurry and take it back! Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty! IS ANYBODY HOME? You'll make the tiger run away! Mr. Tiger! Here, kitty kitty! Think it's okay, letting ourselves in? I don't like the feel of this. Mr. Tiger! Mr. Tiger! Are you in there? Nobody's here. I'm sure he's here! Let's look! Boss! Find him? Take a look at this! What're you doing? Get looking for him! It's just that I've never seen one this small. And there's a mid-sized one. And this big one! Boss... What now? What kind of person would use this monstrous tooth brush? Start looking, or I ll really get mad! Now where could that tiger have gotten to? That seat! What kind of person would have that monstrous seat? And that monstrous spoon! That monstrous plate! And what kind of thing would eat salad like this? Boss there's no doubt about it! There's some kind of great big thing living here! Something like a man-eating bear! Maybe it even ate the tiger! A footprint! Even a man-eating bear's footprints aren't this big! What is it? I don't see anything. It was... This big! Strange, I could've sworn I saw it. What? T-tiny and r-round! I don't see anybody. Over there! Welcome! You guys are burglars, right? This is great! It's the first time I've ever seen a burglar! Burglars! Burglars! How do you do? I'm Papa Panda! Too bad. Just when I finally got to see real burglars! They must be very busy. Mommy! Dinner! Dinner! Yes, I guess it's that time. Let's eat! Let's eat! Let's eat! Somebody ate it! Somebody ate my curry! Yeah, you're right. I wonder if those burglars ate it? I'll get you some more. I'm sure those burglars must've been very hungry. Just like me. Someone used my towel and got it all dirty. Someone broke my trumpet! Somebody's sleeping in my bed. Oh, dear! It's a tiger! A baby tiger! This is my daddy. This is my mommy. Mine too! Mine too! Great! After the burglars, a tiger came to our house! I'm Tiny! I'm Panny! Tiny! Tiny! Panny! Panny! This is good. What a nice visitor! Come on, let's all have dinner together! More, please! Ready... settee... here we come! We can't get out! They're sleeping side-by-side. Dad? I wonder where that tiger came from? Wonder if he has a mom? I'll ask around in town, tomorrow. Daddy! Hi! Dad! I'm going to run some errands. I wanna go, too! Hang on a minute. I'm just going to stick this in the mailbox. Stay off the tracks! I will. Me too! Mommy! Wonder where they went? Strange. I wonder if they went on ahead? Mimi! Did you know the circus was in town? The circus? It came in last night, on the train! Yeah, and there are lions and all kinds of animals! Hey, you wanna go? Is there a tiger in that circus? I dunno. Probably! Come on, let's go! Then maybe Tiny belongs to the circus... Which means... Well? Are you going, or what? Sure, I'll go! Oh, what a fix! Where on earth could that tiger have gotten to? We've turned the place upside-down. And I had my fill of that house last night. Gee, a circus! A panda! After it! It's that panda! Stop! The panda's gonna get eaten by the tiger! No way. You children are naughty! Come on, just a quick look! Come on, just a little! No, I said. We're setting up. Come back tomorrow and see. And bring ticket money! Not fair! Mister! Have you seen my panda Panny? Panda? Yeah! The panda and tiger are lost! Help! A panda's gone into the tiger's cage! Hey, stop! Get back here! Come on... That's a good girl, let go of that panda. Come on, pandas don't taste any good! Please, let him out. Please! No, stop! She's in danger! This is my mommy! Hello, you must be Tiny's mom. I'm Mimiko, Panny's mom. Great! I'm so excited! Hooray! The tiger came back! How nice! The burglars, and Tiny, and the circus folk were all nice. Look! The boss gave us some tickets, to thank us. Let's all go tomorrow. A circus! A circus! Tiny's gonna be in the show with his mom. It's going to be very nice weather tomorrow. Hey, is it raining? Hurry, Dad! Right. I don't like the rain I don't like the rain. I wonder if Tiny and the others are getting wet. They'll be okay. Rain is important; it makes living things stronger. And it's especially good for bamboo. I don't like when it rains. The circus will be cancelled. Don't worry I'm sure it'll be nice out tomorrow. Hey, let's have a snack. A snack? Here! It's Tiny! "Dear Grandma, the storm still hasn't passed. The rain just pours down. Panny is very disappointed. I'm sure there's going to be a big flood. I wonder how Tiny and the others are. I'm very worried about them." Mommy, I'm scared. I'm right here. Don't be afraid, go to sleep. Is Tiny okay? Sure! Tiny's mom is very strong, after all. I'm gonna give Tiny my cookie! I'm sure he'll be surprised! Now close your eyes. Dad! Hurry and wake up! Dad, look! Some fish! Isn't this nice! A nice flood. And the bamboo is especially nice! Dad! Time for lunch! Coming! Here, help yourself. Thank you. Daddy! Yes? Since you're down there, get some jam from the kitchen. Sure. Tiny! Tiny! The circus ball. So the circus must be flooded, too. Wha't could this be? Tiny! Tiny! Read it! Read it! These are Tiny's footprints, but... It says, "Help, help!" Signed, Tiny. So they're having trouble with all the water! Dad! Let's save them! Take this, Dad! Here. Got it. And we're off! Isn't it nice, Dad? Look, the town looks like an island! Oh, it's Mimi! Boss, where are Tiny and the others? The animals were washed away by the water. That's terrible! So you guys took off without them? We tried to get them onto the train. But the water came suddenly and only the people escaped. Mimi! Poor Tiny and the others! Over there! Tiny! You're safe, now! We're going to get you out! We have food! Just wait a bit longer! Here! My cookie! It's going to get a little noisy. Come on out. There you are. This is fun! Nice, Dad! My turn, next! There. Here's some cabbage. Carrots for Mr. Giraffe. Ham! Cookies for the horses! I'm so excited! Look, there's no water. We've gotta stop it, Dad! This is incredible! Even more incredible! Boss, did you hear a train? Impossible. See? I told you. Don't be stupid. There it is! Dad, isn't this nice? Stop! Please stop! Hurry! Get a move on! Mimi! The brakes! The brakes! I can't! I dunno which one's the brake! We're gonna crash! We're gonna crash! Daddy, make us stop! Please, Dad! Dad! Who's there? Oh, Mr. Mayor. Sorry about the racket. You're the greatest, Dad! "And so, Grandma, The people in town and from the circus were very happy. And we're even happier than before, so don't worry. Well, I'd better go. Goodbye, Grandma. Your Granddaughter, Mimiko."
