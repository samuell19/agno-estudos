She can't start working this early again Whoever arrives first gets what he wants Don't be an idiot who cares about work and doesn't care about fun There is no man in her life And you, what a man, as it turns out! It's not fair, my back is the problem You worry about your back Let her worry about what makes her happy It's not who we are waiting for The afflicted friend It's always better to hit them in the back The old man must have come from the goat way near the hill you were right We should have watched that road too Just take two men "King killer" I did it again I did it again - The stables? - Checked the stables and bird garden - Did you catch them in the bird park? I didn't understand why the birds were so loud I'm a little glad I checked it out myself you know what... - If I were to guess... - "Forest King" Did he tell you about the forest? I'll call the guard Yeah, and what rumors will spread when you find them? - I trust my men - Me too But I don't trust their gossipy wives and buddies or that rant Frye. That rant Fry put out 16 fights last night sixteen The whole country... Walking at the edge of a knife But you are really wrong... from time to time We can't stand a scandal What does the church suggest then? I will go out after him Meet me in the yard, bring Fry with you We'll make his gossip work in our favour Interesting idea - You're late - I was watching you from the trees - Can't I watch you? It's unbecoming of a woman Like meeting you here... now... on my own? Or do you just call that confidence? Too much confidence leads to arrogance - I didn't think it would happen - I was strongly advised not to I shouldn't be here I had a friend of mine borrow this for me to escape my guards It makes me think hard about getting close to you Let's not talk about tiles - Does it bother you? - It makes me tired I definitely don't want to bother you with words Now act with confidence - I didn't think it would happen - I won't let you enjoy it Will you deprive your property? - arrogant Oh really? - Two days later - Exactly You are now more than what I see Soldier... Richard. And you... oh (leah) We are both roaming in the woods - As friends - Friends? Priest (Anselm) I should gather the king's guard For what purpose? I suppose the king is going to town on business something like that The council has officially announced He must accompany the king's guard whenever he goes out - Did he go out? what? Two days left to install it, work can wait He is in prayer All day long? He doesn't want to be bothered by anyone - Did the council say that then? Many people enter and leave the city Caution is a must - There was a lot of fighting over that crown - The fight is over - It seems to me you're out - Right He doesn't need me to hold his hand What do you think I do? I pray on his behalf? I'm a priest and I'm not a nurse Your name is Fry, isn't it? I heard a lot about you... in recognition It occurred to me now that you... if you were out The king will most likely be with you So I was getting ready to take a guard Very good but does not need a guard He is in prayer - It will be all day? exactly Tell his men to get some rest the next weeks will be bus ready, my lord - I'm no one's master. - I misunderstood, sir You are nothing but... (Anselm) Priest of the King But I really... sire It's easy to forget, I know, enjoy your picnic Did you hear that? The king prepares his soul for the burden he will bear Until the day of his death I want two men on guard at the church No one will come close to the king No one is allowed to enter Concept? follower I caught you You should draw your sword You are in danger Are you afraid to take out your sword? - I caught you now - What makes you so sure? I think it smells like rose water And the... horse dung I don't smell like dung Why didn't you draw that sword? I only draw it when I want to kill That's a terrible truth It's a heinous act What is it called? a sword - It's not funny - It's a little funny The best swords all have names, right? My sword has no name Maybe I'll name it... Sword (Richard) - Well done the role - You too I hope we can live with this insult Yeah, that's what they'll remember I'll take him back to the stables And make it look like he went out for a walk after prayer - If I don't come back by sunset... - If you don't come back by sunset, I'll come look for you It's always an adventure - Go with the Lord's care, stay safe - Expensive African spices are out of stock But we have some left Not as luxurious as your herbs from Jerusalem. Not as much as your Spanish seasoning, it really depends on your taste Do you want cinnamon sticks from Arabia? - We've been here since sunrise - He's here now with a girl - Kill them both - I only paid for one I'm just a messenger, nothing more Don't negotiate like you're more than that I will do whatever I want Well, let's hope that what you like matches what is expected of you just a message - Imagine if every day was like this - You mean horrible - You're horrible - That's right I snore when I laugh it's not befitting of a woman at all Burp if I eat too fast - I hate mosquitoes - Everyone hates mosquitoes No, I hate him I really hate him so much And... I'm a stable worker I was not born on this earth I was not born into a family of stature I am not allowed to love people of status I am not fit to love a king I'm not perfect terrible You don't believe me I hear beautiful words with amazing thoughts believe me Are you offering to marry me? There is a lot that needs to happen before... Laws and rites Coronation and ceremonies Traditions and legacies All to please others How can we change the future if we do not forget the past? Some traditions must be observed Some legacies must be preserved but why? To please a kingdom and many others others? What about you? If I could marry you today... I don't know if you'll agree Is what I feel is your dagger? calm down calm down I don't mind if the deer is watching Are you teasing me? (Lea) stay where you are I have to take out the arrow, clean the wound and stop the bleeding - Have you done that before? I've seen him do it several times That is, you did not do it - Take me back to the castle, I'll go to the perfumer - What explanation can I give? fishing accident No, the arrow will go out Is... Is the wound serious? if? That perfume... a good idea It will take us an hour to come back maybe if we take the main roads - If we come back - I swear we'll be back It's a covenant - I meant alive - Me too - Do you have extra water, priest? naturally Leave a little for my trip - Where are you headed? - to Kenswood Is the wound serious? Your frankness hurts you - Let me catch my breath - There may be more of them What makes you think so? That's not a trip of barely two miles How wide is the forest? Twenty miles, I think It's thirty miles if you get lost in it I thought priests are not allowed to carry guns Their swords are made of premium quality steel They were hired men, without the zebrafish armor Poor as peasants with decent swords respiratory respiratory We can't carry swords But the Bible does not say anything about the clubhead I warn you to walk carefully in those woods, but... It seems to me that bandits should tread carefully - Near you - Are there bandits? Of all kinds This is (England) Watch those clouds The weather changes faster than the flicker of a candle respiratory respiratory did you rest Come on - Who would hire them? My father had many faithful to him But he died and gave you the throne One's decision is not always appreciated by many - I shouldn't have suggested this - If you hadn't suggested it, I would have suggested it Do you remember the vineyard last summer? You remember the vineyard that's only because of the wine Made me forget about wine This would have been a precedent you look beautiful And now? More expensive.. than ever Come on - If you want to kill someone... - Conserve your strength Talking helps me forget the pain. - So, speak softly, Leah. If you want to kill someone... How many men would you hire? to kill me? five or six maybe more How many are they? Use me as bait Do you have a better idea? help (Takeras) help (Takeras) (Takeras) Who is Takiras? my horse A boy threw me off his back and I hit my shoulder on a tree branch Are you here alone? It's accompanied by a fishing squad You look foreign It must have been a royal band There are harsh penalties for common people who fish here And you look from the public And you are charming... Besides you're... ugly That's funny Hunting teams tend to make some noise Don't go far in the woods nor the screams You will have fun with this girl How many of you are there? We have enough Don't know how to count I'll add dullness to your list of traits - I'm not sure about stupidity yet - What's that supposed to mean? If you are thinking of raping an injured girl, you are obviously stupid Just wondering if you're stupid enough to try I love bravery They are fighting more Come on, have your first try with this, Frankie. (Frankie)...come on and teach this bitch a lesson It's Frankie's turn. - You've done this before? - Yeah, yeah I think I'll add "pathetic" to your list of traits Come on, Frankie. Get out you are dirty You want this to happen, right? You're a bitch, come on, Frankie! - Oh, my God! Teach this bitch a lesson (Frankie) - Where's Frankie, Lynol? - Where's Frankie? - Shut up, shut up - Is Linol going to teach me a lesson, too? What's going on, Harold? Come on, Frankie. You're not very good at it, are you? (Thomas) Who sent you? I'm not... Move and I'll cut your balls I do this to the horses every day You will be much easier because your body is so small - Your men are all dead. - No Tell us who sent you... and we'll let you live you bitch We are on the edge They classify us as controlled peasants to a certain extent The real warriors will be in the middle I don't mean any offense by the way, but... We are safe Is it your first time? It's my second time Dad supplies the castle with cross arches There are feathered limbs on the arches It's my own handiwork I'm an arrow maker Yeah, get the last one done at lunchtime I couldn't see anything at all However... I got my run Do you know? One of us tried to escape last time I don't recommend it Come on Where are you going? through the forest In what matter? picking mushrooms The forest is closed - By order of the king - Did the king order that the forest be closed? Are you deaf? Yours must be a little simple This is how the traitor hangs You better go on your way now First: There is no king The king has died and his son has not ascended the throne yet Second: If the new king had given an order, he would not have hung the banner of the old king there Third: He wouldn't have hired the king's guard and gave them a jacket without a helmet Finally... Far from the fact that the issue of betrayal is a mistake I brought a spear to a club-headed fight What? We must get out of the way something is wrong Oh my God! What? (Richard)! The wound festers Poison may be the cause It might just be a dirty stock How much time do I have? Less than we thought We must clean the wound again I want to see the world with you I gave you my covenant We'd better go then Do you know a cure? Maybe my priest knows If the hemlock is spotted, there is no cure for it This is how they killed Socrates in ancient Greece Not the hemlock spot - But the smell - I didn't say it was a hemlock But what if it was? There's no time to waste, so we're leaving We don't have time to waste just chill That was foolishness You could have let them pass Don't let your anger define who you are, Richard. - You're better than that - Who said I do that? Let me set the speed I'll walk as fast as I can Who do you think is responsible for this? (Europe) is more enmity than kindness Scottish masters vying for independence The French are behaving...as usual Tensions in the Far East with (Jerusalem) and (Constantinople) My father's allies are worried about their positions But it's not any of them, is it? England has many enemies And you have more enemies Most of them... you'd call them friends Maybe you are right We must follow the path Like two animals in a trap Wolves have entered the lion's den Will I ever be the polytheist again? - The lamb leads them to slaughter - You are the lamb? I do not think so Don't get too close or I won't have room to pounce I'll attract them but keep our distance Like a hawk with a rabbit - What a romantic! - What a woman you are! Nice place to die Touch your sword and I will open your neck to the wind Your friend went to pee It was his last time You can die just as quietly and quickly Or you can help me Draw your sword and stick it to the ground Or take it easy and die - Now your dagger - I don't have one Just give us a sword I couldn't pay for my dagger, so you searched me There's a dagger in your boot Watching you sharpen him Are you satisfied? Who are you chasing? You agreed to help me in exchange for your life - Shall we end this agreement now? We were chasing a rich hater Another rich hater wants him dead Give me the names Why do I care? It's a chance to kill a rich hater for money Your anger cannot be hidden under a smile Nor fear you Did you poison that arrow? - Please - come on, you evil liar - Please. - What did you use? - Please. - What did you use? Speak now or let a coward like you go to the grave I beg you He was telling the truth There are men down and to the west What sound will you make when you find your man? The sound of a crow, everyone who hears it will echo If issued 3 times we come to the group How many of you are there? How many did you kill? - How many of you are there? - How many have you killed? Was he the first? There must be 19 of us now - eighteen You are in my class Shall we take the road? Do I look stupid? slowly This is what Socrates did. He was moving slowly - After drinking hemlock - not blotched hemlock But follow suit Keep going, I'm with you I was lucky to be surprised do not you think so? The wind was blowing against you You haven't showered in days The only thing with good luck is that you have the advantage Unfortunately, I didn't meet you Although we are now on the same side The hand of the rich and noble This is charming It's easy to look at them like that while you're hiding in the shadows I came for justice - I came because someone else put money in your pocket - that's not true It's a harsh reality Want the hard facts? They call this forest the king's forest The public can't hunt here They cannot live here without paying taxes and tribute Do something wrong and you might lose a hand or worse Even if you're starving, you can't hunt a deer here What if everyone catches a deer? No one will be left What does she have? What if everyone cut down trees and lived here? There will be no forest Your argument is silly It will never happen There are a lot of animals and a lot of trees enough for everyone Do you doubt human greed? I see human greed Looks like some of our guys are coming Wait Get down, get down let's go Did the devil in a blacksmith's shop? He's probably riding new horses for his horse exactly Even a devil's horse needs new horseshoes Street sellers say it's lucky, but priests say it repels the devil They say it's money for easy work what... What do we have here? some water Please, dear sir, I want some water Mr? You definitely know who she's talking to Bring some water for our guest, Barrios. What is a lady like you doing around here? I've definitely had better days Are you scared? There is nothing to be afraid of here Take away your blades You need our help, not our protection And now... With whom have you been here, madam? I'm not a lady I said don't get too close - I needed a little water. - Take it We're leaving A few more turns and then we'll take a short cut across the plains small plateau The castle will be in our sight afterwards I need a moment to rest naturally shield from this? Speak or you will die. It's Captain Hutton. He was the captain of the town guard - From Branstable, Devon - It's too far from home Neither of us was allowed to know each other Palace poets searched for guard leaders from everywhere - Who hired you? - Captain He hired us A guy named Mastiff rented it. That's all I know A rich man must have paid them where do you come from? Hayden, Yorkshire man from yorkshire My mom told me that you are friendly and stubborn We are friendly when we want it - Will you let me live? - I said I would I promised to kill you You are really stubborn Let's take it as a broken covenant I don't think I can walk alone I will walk with you You bleed more than a sinking ship I ask you That was my moment to betray you You are a masterpiece, right? When you hear some confessions I want to confess You will know that betrayal hides in the least conspicuous places You always have an answer, right? I had a long time to think I suggest you try it yourself, you might live a little longer What is the value of ideas without action? What is the value of actions that you did not think carefully about? Why did you come to find him not an armed guard? I'm late for prayer We better catch him soon Is there a place you should be? I hope others catch it I'm bad at using a spear I'm fine with a crossbow, but reloading it... My dad twisted his back trying to reload it at the boycott fair last year Was he throwing at the county fair? Of course not He was just reloading for them Everyone pays a silver coin when they win Why are you here then? It wasn't meant to be My brother volunteered, but he fell ill He said no one would know the other The pay is good, so I thought I'd take his place great Are you a fighter then? but rehearsed at a blacksmith But I fought three battles Mom said... The only way for the world to remember your name She did something great I thought this might be the great thing I got the wrong idea Your mom was right Although chasing a man in the woods is neither great nor noble back home choose now - They're not professionals - some of them might be That's your brother's doing, isn't it? He brought everyone who could get him with his dirty hands To do his dirty work for him I always hated you (John) You have a huge and lasting influence on him - Is this necessary? - He came here to die And now he has found it Why catch up with your hateful rich man? He's reckless...and spoiled sometimes selfish All the features you love to hear All qualities that we all have in our own ways But I follow him because he does what he says that's easy Anyone with the honor would do that Is it easy? Your father... did he always do what he said? they were bakers They have fewer responsibilities than each other - and less money Was it really what they always said? My dad said it would make us rich And yet? I am here (William Marshall)... Gentleman Fight against Richard in the war When Richard won... he gave the land to the likes of William. And everyone who eventually changed their position, hoping to be with the winning party He took land from them Reward the respected And punish the delinquents Friend or foe... treat everyone the same Your hateful rich man is King Richard. Haven't you thought why there's a group of you out there for one hateful rich man? How do you feel now? I hated his father I'm sure he's just as bad Why? I hate all noble origins - How many do you know? I won't be friends with someone like them “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her.” Do you think they will be friends with me? They threw the stone in the first place Think as you conclude, think before you act Think carefully before you react Is this also from the Bible? no It's my word Come on There are more of them let me help - I can... - I know You can fight... What are you breathing? But I can't fight and I'm worried about you Did they really warn you not to marry me? Everyone I mentioned it to Did I really mention it to people then? - I haven't seen anyone in a while - They're here - We should have seen more - We must have been fewer what... relax You can hear rich people coming long before you see them Because of the jingling of the coins they carry The more you do tasks like this, the more prosperous you are I can always tell... veteran soldiers by how relaxed they are You are not a soldier Hired worker, mercenary, soldier - They're all the same - Yeah, but it's not The soldier is trained and defends his country Fighting for gold as we do There is talk of an upcoming crusade I'll go there after this It is the place of real gold Debt means money How are they going to pay the cathedral in Paris otherwise? It was built years ago - What do you intend to do with it? I am here to help you There is something there You better not betray me, woman You are! I saw something come back Are you here for the gold too? Is that all your life is worth to you? Is that it? His answer was "yes." Are there others with you? I myself almost didn't come looking I'm glad you came It's rare to have a good day when you forget to see a priest (Anselm) - (Leah) - Madam it's not... - A tangential arc arrow? This is it You're lucky, the bone wasn't hurt Sewage rat poison - Is it dangerous? no You are such a bad liar cm? Yes A poison that will either weaken its power or prove fatal? Impossible to know But we must take you back to the castle I have nothing to help her - Is she a friend of yours? - She brought me here She is the one who will lead us out of the woods - I think he sent 20 men to kill you - No, you killed that number Let me simplify it for you, if she dies, you will die - How many more? I do not know - Take us back to the castle - and leave the knife - Thank you. - It's my pleasure Pain comes and goes Can you feel with your fingers? Yes - And your toes? no Well... you're standing well enough And that's a good sign Put your weight on me... As much as you need it (Lea) Water The arrow head appears to be stationary now It stops the bleeding, and that's good The pain keeps getting worse - I'm so thirsty - Do you know what poison this was? slowly - Let me take this - I was quite talkative a while ago who is she? Those are maid clothes It's his girlfriend I need a moment to rest It cannot be of noble origin She worked in the stables Along with his fencing master It was no surprise when I like to ride a horse after every lesson We were told our man went out hunting for hunting? I heard they call him "a butcher." Hunt for sport and kill for fun He doesn't like to fish loves birds Eagles and hawks let her hunt And those guys? If you poke a lion with a spear Don't be surprised if your throat slits How are your legs, Leah? Painfully tired - that's a good sign Is this the fastest way? Across these shrublands there is more forest After the lake, then up the hill, and you'll come out of the King's Forest. It will be safer to stay in the woods - it will take longer to cut it You can take the goat road near here - I think you went through it - It's the shortest way - She can lean on my shoulder if she wants - If the King needs help, he will ask for it He's not king yet What horse did you ride yesterday? Lesson) old monster fast and brave The training did him more good than us now We walk with arms crossed with others In public I like this exercise You make bad situations portable - That's a talent - one of many this... - Follow her - I won't leave you (Anselm) The crown jewels have been polished How many more? The rest of them will be the best It's likely that the others were just watching They set up an ambush as a group The idea crossed my mind Let's not make it easy for them You never liked me, Priest Anselm, did you? I have to go Go down the stairs, turn right Walk the whole way across the corridor and it will take you back to the stables Walk fast, but not too fast behave well My friends will run out of excuses for why I'm late Tell them you were held for ransom Are they paying my ransom? this is unbelievable But I'm your prisoner Are you lost, my daughter? your daughter? Excuse me - I saw you on the floor I... - I was praying naturally - Your clothes... - For riding Which is where you came from Sorry if it does not live up to the standard of your regular guests Are you a guest? Why would I be here for no other reason using the castle equipment? That's a big word for a foreigner Should I use a smaller word? Mostly... my daughter be nice If I hadn't been nice, I'd have called the guard to escort you out But you won't summon them? no (Lea)? You met me at an unfavorable circumstance I am the priest (Anselm) I heard a lot about you and me too He trusts you This is what we have in common What makes you say that? you are here I can say we'll see each other more I hope that I do not wish - farewell - farewell - Sorry - you don't have to - How's the pain? There is nothing wrong (Lea)... I can no longer feel my legs I haven't felt them in a long time It's the hemlock spot You can't be sure That fast and that way I can and I'm sure I wish I was wrong what can we do? There is no cure Even if we go back all I can do is make you comfortable Let's go to the lake there I have always loved swans They will pay the price, don't worry just chill I will guard Goodbye... my lady Let's see the swans A swan has only one lover That's why I love her I know how much you love her That's why I love her She is very peaceful and graceful He kissed me - I can't... - Let me... don't lay by my side It doesn't matter to live But to live right (Socrates)? Take the best of all sentences - I think this is a proper goodbye - Never I gave you my covenant I heard a lot of vows today This is what you should call your sword breach of covenant There will always be those who challenge you Only he who fights without a goal has no enemies Who fights for truth and honor? They have more enemies His name will be the breaker of the covenant Socrates would have been proud Our relationship was not meant to last Maybe in a different world... When we are both swans They are crowding - How many are they? - I guess? about 20 Carried her the whole way, she'd be exhausted as you like If they had cross bows, they would rain them on us from afar as soon as they saw us It doesn't look good, does it? - Stop, Richard. We'll be in their net soon if they have it We were in a hurry but... - There's no rush now. - Brother John. he did this you did this you did this Where you go, danger follows you - If only I could... - What? Do what ever you want? If everyone did what they wanted, the world would be a mess Doing the right thing is what makes the difference Coming here was a mistake and you know it I won't let you make the same mistake with me You don't have to hear this I didn't have to come and find you When I realized you went and did the only thing - Who asked you not to - Seeing the woman I love? Rather, it is endangering the country You choose a thinker only for yourself what you want You are about to become king Every decision you make from that moment on will reverberate through time Yet you behave like this? If that arrow hit you, your brother would have chased after the throne And your illegitimate brother, too The masters would revolt and the country would fall into a civil war with thousands of dead And all because of getting between a girl's legs? - You have gone too far - As you have gone too far, my prince Let's lay Leah in the shade and approach cautiously Then we come back and bring her home I don't want to leave her And I don't want my death to be another of your mistakes At dusk our men will come looking for us I won't stand here waiting to become a darling of arrows If they dare to move first as one we will lose Or break them up into small groups Or we choose the battlefield and attack first The more time they take to shoot, the more accurate they will be Say a prayer for the men over there, priest Satan is at large there shoot shoot very anxious - Who sent you? - I swore an oath so be it If someone is going to confess, we must keep them alive This is out of the question I recognize this place The hill is ahead, it's close to where you entered They'll catch up with us soon if we don't get to that hill We will have the advantage of high I will accept every advantage we can get now With a little luck... the sun may favor us At the top of the hill the sun will be in their eyes Follow my steps That's all I know We must go to the hill now We ambush them while they're trying to leave (mastiff) I said they walk in the open It took us a long time to catch them are you scared - If you saw them fighting... - Fear leads to hesitation Hesitating means death We are 40 men apply to them Cross bow shooters first They killed half that number I think the money should be divided equally This means more to you All you care about is money, right? The way I see it... Blood means gold to the right person But you're not here for the gold, are you? - My brother is in chains - In the king's dungeon? Caught him hunting in the "King's Forest" last winter Pursuing a noble is justice for your brother I think they are fighting for something higher than a noble person His girlfriend was killed by one of our archers with a crossbow I poisoned... the hemlock blotch We might have hired a competitive member of the court I have no idea All plans go through a broker, and the broker pays me, and I pay you hemlock blotchy? - What happens if he doesn't pay? We'll kill him, but he'll pay Even if these two escape, one of them will suffice We will deserve a reward What happens if someone who rents it doesn't pay? The broker will tell everyone who hired him Albeit? For ladies and gentlemen, - Knowledge is more important than money - We must go to the hill now We ambush them while they try to leave We are approaching The hill is a good idea, and so is the reward request it is time Three shouts They are coming to kill us We must hope they are not on top of the hill We trust they are slow to reload And we advance in the sun - It's a lot of assumptions - It's a lot of faith, priest Believing in other men often leads to disappointment Let's trust ourselves then When there is opportunity, there is hope - Who shouted 3 times? - I woke up because you were healthy, where are they? These damned palace poets can't organize a prayer in a monastery I didn't like this broker called Blundell. Blundell? Beaucham is our man You are not supposed to know that There, they're heading up the hill, Archers, go ahead Maybe the sun loves us so far Archers will get 1 chance Follow in my footsteps, we have the advantage of height get up there there shoot go ahead wait right Now You don't have to die today - Four on a rich boy - I'm not a boy I'm Prince Richard I will be king of England soon Duke of Normandy, Cottonwood and Gascony Count (Anjou) You all committed treason here today But I give you my word Enough blood has been spilled Tell me the name of the one who sent you And you can go home alive Who will pay us then? You are? When I look at a dead man, life is a precious gift You're looking at the king's killer And you look like you're about to do something stupid Tell him who hired us I may have many traits as a "mercenary" one of which is But when I give my word it is stronger than oaks - Don't be a fool - tell him I won't tell him, I won't tell you Tell him who hired us won't pay you now you are right - All I have left is my honor - Not for long Make him scream, men stop, what is this? It's the hemlock spot - Rat poison. - You stupid bastard, Derek. Tell him who sent us - No one said we should use hemlock - Tell him who sent us You are... Poison is something I never use. Who sent you? I have a simple rule My word is my covenant And I gave it and I will never say And I won't ask again - Let's see who is better at wielding the sword then - I know There is no shame if she says she You fight brilliantly, you mercenary But you will not defeat both of us if? I know the name of the court poet And yet? I want your word that you will free those in your cells - Because they broke the laws of the jungle - Do you have demands now, too? I submit a petition We didn't know we were chasing you I didn't love your father but I don't know you All I can do is believe that you are different You want a fresh start, and the ones in your cells deserve it too I'll give you the name either way but I should have asked She died, right? He asked that we not actually use poison The poet of the palace is Beauchamp. It's one of John's men. I'm sorry for your loss If you are a man who keeps his word... I'm ordering it now Is there more in this forest? If they are not here, they are either dead or fleeing for their lives I give you my word Now I give you my word then kneel down Answer quickly and honestly Did you promise to kill me?
