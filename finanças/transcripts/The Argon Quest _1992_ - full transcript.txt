The frighten the ignorant and simple minded my coward. It works. But I don't see our little trio anywhere. I wonder where they went. It was it's like they just disappeared. Oh I didn't hear them in the brush anywhere. The stone statue of course. This is. A giant sized tone. Joints i go. I think. To be. It's definitely a do that come this network necklace. Begging entrusted to great number of great ground. Just loads and trouble out god. Oh god. It's time to wake up. Look, I found to magic bubble one. Argo gone. Oh on gone this is urgent. I world you. There's not the little door. Mona there disturbed the sleep of the great our god. Well, and my question. If you please, my name was tracy howard? And missing my brother away and like go from wrong we've come on a tree necklace to the graveyard on. Well the necklace of are, let me see that. Woah. Taking my. I'm not a worm. I'm a caterpillar. And I'm the caretaker of the sleeping place of the great our god. Oh, yes. Yes. It's the genuine necklace alright? But our guns not due to wake up for another fifty years or so. You can leave the necklace with me if you like. And I'll make sure it gets it when he wakes up. I don't this. So We're supposed to give it to the great argo aragorn. And we need dark gone Was it island's dying. The whole world's dying. And we can't wake up the grid going. No seems to me there was something in Paragon aragorn care of sleeping giants manual about what to do in this very situation. Got it to wake a giant from its rest, fill the ring in place. North south east and west, each one in its space. But that doesn't make any sense. I just quote him I don't write them. It's obviously a little, but what it mean? Nothing we do seems to wake him. And the middle doesn't seem to be any help either. Well, maybe we should look in the other room. A. Sure. Right over there. Beautiful Look at this light join rock Crystal. And look at that wall. Looks like a whole bunch of tv something and pictures. Like the Crystal lamp that there has in the lighthouse house. Look at this. Look at this carving. Shapes. You're right. Some of these carving are the same as Sa aragorn necklace. It's like looking into the crystal lamb. Maybe this switch stolen it perfectly we just see. It done with compass and it's the way we're gonna wake up the graveyard on. To break a giant from its rest. Fill the ring in place. North south east west. Each one in its face each one was. We've only got the necklace. We are the ones that go in all the other places. Fill And remember when we get there we stick to the plan We hang around out of sight until they win the great argo god. Understand what. If they find the great arch on, we leap it and take all the credit. This is it's the perfect I really must find tune next bell someday but it's good enough. Because there's a stone statue of out that they disappeared through twelve four fifties sixty and how you likes some dials. Sixteen, you can assume that hole up there's part of the pattern. Will it must be because there are definitely sixteen dials. And there's gotta to be a connection between those labs and this one room sixteen collections but that still doesn't explain why we can't wake up the great arc on. Oh why the necklace fits in that ring, or why falling apart? Well, hey, don't look at me. I'm just a caretaker. I wasn't even here when the great argo on fell asleep See I hired on when the last caterpillar decide to retire. And there were are at least twenty or so caterpillars before her. Whenever there's a law dial, the obvious is to turn the dye back carefully We don't know what these dials control nothing. Turn. It's okay. It's okay. Jacket. It's another one of our gods. I bet this has something to do with halloween women and I came to muslim island. If that brought that here. Back here Now if we could find some way to wake him. Then convincing him the read where the heroes of the hour would be. This you send me back to my ancestral home out of simple folk gratitude. This is gratitude. Did you think gratitude why keeping an eye on things of course. Now python. We don't wanna wake the giant. All we wanna do is keep him sleep. Why we lose the place say think of it python. All the power those bow crystals and all we have to do is a those story little. While we do our dirty little deed. Birds do we have a certain charming kill my. You can't trust it right no. I used to work for don't think of myself. That's why you're here. I know it seems strange, but it's up to all of us kids to save the world. My guess is, there's thing with some family heir loops a join named gaga on engaged one of your ancestors. That's right. It was handed down by my great break of mine too. That's why you're here. The giant name dag icon is a asleep in the next room and we need all the jewels that brought you here to wake them up. We to save the world. What can do? Well, first of all, if you could lay all the jewels on that table over there, and then sort them up by shape and fit them all here. To break a giant from its rest, fill the ring in place. Nor south east west. Each one in its face It's the witch Instantly the witch. Wow. Where all these little creatures come from. There's too many of them. Who found my bubble wall? And on you're awake. Of course, I'm awake. Someone activated my compass It was my fault. My name is tracy. Chris I came to return his necklace. It gave my great great grandmother. I remember now the was ship. Oh Yes.
