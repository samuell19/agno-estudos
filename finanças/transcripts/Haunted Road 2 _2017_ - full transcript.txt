Where's the money? Here is the money. Why? Visitors to Genting are mostly gamblers. Gambling places are full of ghosts. Let's get out of here! Alright Even such a large hotel is fully booked, ...this is so unbelievable! Did someone jumped off the building? Why take things so hard! Is today a public holiday in Malaysia? How come it is full house everywhere? Yes Isn't it supposed to be hot in Malaysia? Why is it so cold here? This is a highland, that's why the temperature is lower. No wonder. We also need this lady's passport. Darling. Thank you. Sir. Here is your document. This is your key... ...room 808. Ok, thanks. I want this room for tonight! A murder case just happened here. Stay in the room. Hey! You! We have an agreement with that man. I will get you another room right away. Die one by one. Die one by one. Die together. Can you give us another room? Sorry, this is our last available room. We are fully booked tonight. We'll die if we go down the hill… ...when it's raining. One plus one plus seven plus four... ...is thirteen... ...thirteen is very unlucky. Superstitious! A few numbers scared you until like this. Then if I tell you. This is the most famous haunted hotel in Asia. Wouldn't you be scared till you faint? Really? Who knows whether it is true? Jun Let us go down the hill right away Not a good idea. It's raining heavily. And we are unfamiliar with road conditions. Don't scare yourself So what if there is a ghost? A ghost also has to respect human! Moreover... This is an era where human are scarier… ...than ghost. Jun. Did you notice. The expression of that old woman. Like she'd seen something. Don't be cranky. This way. Let's go! What happened? There's a small girl. And a lady. Mind your own business. You must be tired. Let's go. What are you thinking about? She's crying and looked very sad. We did not even ask. Darling. We are in Malaysia. This is not our country. Let's be less nosy. Talk less. Be happy. We are so lucky tonight. You see. What a lucky day? Let's play roulette. Black jack. Slot machine. We're winning in whatever we played. Winning has never been so fun! Darling. I love you. I love you too. We must always be together. Marry me. Then we will always be together. Haven't take a bath yet. Hi, everyone. My boyfriend and I came to Malaysia. See... He proposed to me! Ok. You should have a rest. Talk to you later Why are you so nervous? Who else is in this room other than myself? It's ok. Just the pulley is broken. So many problems with this room. Call from Gao. Maybe urgent. Yi. Rest in peace. Can't believe you have gone just like that. Ling, come up to the balcony, urgent! Rest in peace Yi. Can't balance it no matter… ...how I tried. What's the problem? Assistant Accountant Ling. Let's have our meal first. And continue later. Ok. Supervisor Jun. So blissful. I'm so envious of this. Luckily you're still here. Our photocopier at the marketing department... ...is giving problem again. I'm rushing for a big case. The agreement must be done tonight. Can you help me out? You go on first. I will be there in a while. Thank you very much. Sorry Ling. I need to borrow your lover. I go first. I heard that you guys are going to. The branch office in Malaysia next month. One month's assignment? What a coincidence. I'm also going there… ...to settle some thing. I go to Kuala Lumpur frequently. So quite familiar with that place. I will show you guys around. Supervisor Jun. See you later. What? You men seem to like. Women like Yi? Nonsense. I like women like you. Darling. You know There's no one like you. Accompanying me for overtime. Have dinner with me. I have thought about it. When I make enough money. We will get married. You will then be tied together with me the whole life time. The whole life time. Ok, Jun. What if you can't do that? Jun! Jun! Stomach pain again. How about I'll go with you to the hospital tomorrow! If I can't do that. I will die a horrible death. Is that you Jun? Jun. Jun, where are you? Jun. Who's there? Jun. What 's the matter with you? There's probably no one in there! Why don't you go and ask at the front counter. It's all right. It's me. It's me! it's alright! Where did you go middle of the night? I went to find the service staff. The internet signal is not good. Are you from China? Yes. You too? I'm a local. I often stay here. Your room. What about our room? Let me tell you… ...this room has been vacant a long time. Some time ago there was a woman. Who lost a lot of money. Jumped out from this room. After that those who stayed here. Will see her in the middle of the night. Checked out at night So it has been left vacant… ...and no one stays there. I'm curious… ...how come you stay here. What you have said is true? It's true! I stayed here a few days in a week. There's no point lying to you. Actually. I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything! What's wrong? Sorry We really don't have any more room. Sorry. I don't care. We want to change room! It's ok. It's already mid-night… ...just go to sleep! Here. When we wake up we will leave. I don't want to be here anymore. Police! Someone jumped off the building over there. Please go and help! Where's she? Where's she? Where's she? I really saw someone jumped off the building! Sometimes our eyes will play trick on us. Go back to the room and sleep. Don't bother it. What do you mean? We really saw it! Trust me. Go rest. Nothing has happened here. Jun. Let's get out of here! This haunted place. I wouldn't want to stay another minute. Oh no! What should we do? Our money is still in the room! I don't believe in all these! Hold it. Why does the lift open when there is no body? This hotel sucks. A grandma and grandchild had come in. What happened? Run! Help me. Hurry up! Yi. Let go of Jun. He's mine! Forget it. Reverse the car! Jun. Can we go home now? our work here are almost done. I will talk to the company. To send us back to Beijing! If not. I will go crazy! Ok We go back to pack our luggage and leave. Here. Set the GPS back to Kuala Lumpur. What was in the lift a moment ago? How come I didn't see anything? There was an old woman and a child. Looked like grandma and grandchild. You don't think I made it up, do you? No. I believe you. But. You saw Yi? I can't think of anyone else but her. You should know better than me. Strange. This is the opposite direction. Jun, turn around. We are heading the wrong direction. This is going to the East coast. What? Even the GPS is not working. (Karak highway.) We ran out of gas. What should we do now? Call the car rental company. Oh, no. My phone has no signal. Mine also. I saw a gas station. So. Wait for me. I will go and find it. No. I will come with you. It's too dark. Wait for me here. I will be back soon! Stay inside. I'll be back. Help! I know something is up there. Please help me! Get out and run over here. Don't look back! Let me out. I can't leave Jun behind. I must save him! You can't even save yourself. Please lie down! Let me go! You have been in coma for a day. I want to go and find Jun! Please lie down. Don't stop me! Doctor, the patient is up! I want to go and save Jun. Don't stop me. Police. Police! Based on what you told us. We did a search. We can't find your fiance's body. Also didn't find the bag of money… ...you told us. We checked the immigration record. There is no Jun. The information showed that you came… ...to Malaysia alone. How was it possible? I came with Jun. We won a lot of money at the casino. Many people can confirm that. How is it possible there is no immigration record? Oh. Must be that lady. That ghost. She did all this! Ghost? That lady. It's her. Who killed Jun. You are sure you saw a ghost? Of course. She jumped from the 11th floor and fell to her death. I saw it. She is a ghost. Ok. I shall record your statement. At the same time. We'll give you a psych exam. Hopefully the doctor will be able to help you. What do you mean? I have mental problem? I don't. I came to work in Kuala Lumpur with Jun. And to find some time to sightsee. You can check with Amber Court. We checked. You checked in alone. Don't be nervous. the doctor will help you find the answer. Wait! There's a person who can prove that… ...I didn't lie! Why didn't you tell the truth… ...to the police? If I told the truth. They will think we have mental problem. What is your motive? If you didn't take away the key to room 808. We wouldn't have stayed in room 1174. And wouldn't have met the female ghost. Did you do it on purpose? I'm here to help you. Help me? Jun gone missing. I'm about to be sent to the mental hospital. You are here to help that female ghost, right? Trust me. Leave this place now. I will not trust you. I'm going to find Jun. Dead or alive. Ling! Ling! A lot of resentment follows you. A lot of resentment follows you. Jun. Is that you? Get out of this hospital. Fast! My daughter. Mum, why are you here? You're in trouble. Can I not be here? Mum. Jun is. It's ok. Don't think so much. Get well. Mum will take care of the rest. I saw Jun. He wanted to tell me something. But. He is gone. Ling. You had a concussion. Will be particularly sensitive to sound and light. Sometimes hallucinations will occur. But don't worry. It will be ok after a while. Come. I'll give you a shot. Have a good rest. Ok. Listen to the nurse. Mum will take care of you. Come, lie down. Look. Swimsuit? How do you know I wanted a swimsuit? Didn't you said wanted to go to the beach? So I prepared for you. What are you looking at? Come and help! He's drunk. Why did you drink so much? Didn't you know he has gastric problem? A severe one. He can't eat raw cucumbers, lettuce. And tomatoes. Reading scriptures. Won't make you good girlfriend. My daughter. You see. This is your favorite dates. Mum bought specially for you. Whenever you were unhappy. You took them. And it will cheer you up. Do you remember what it's called? Forget happiness fruit. When I was young. After eating this. I will forget all trouble. Eating it will make you forget Yi. Forget Jun. Forget all unhappiness. But there is one thing. You must never forget. Mum will protect you forever. If you call mum in your heart. I will be there for you. There is no such fruits in Malaysia. Did you bring them from home? Mum will give to you. Whatever you want. Go sit over there. I will wash these first. I know who you're looking for. Sorry, I don’t understand. Follow me. Ok? He follows me from behind? That day, yes. Now, no. Where has he gone? I can’t see him all the time. But I can hear his voice. He said. If you don't find his head… ...and bury it in three days. He will never be reborn. And he will disappear from the universe. You only have one day left. Did he say where to find his head? Perhaps, this man can help you… Help! Only one day left. You're looking for me? You really can help me? Actually you have the answer. Otherwise you wouldn't come to see me. You... Who are you? Someone who can help you. Promise me. You must trust me. How do you want me to trust you? Think about it. We were in the accident together. Why don't I have any injury? Why? Actually you too. Take off the bandage. You will understand. Why? All these are you imagination. What you saw. Are not real. You chose what you wanted to see. You will understand in future. Now, follow me. Ok. I will believe you for the time being. This...

You don't need to find the shaman king anymore. Come, be a good girl. Let's get your injection! She's not a human. She caused lots of death. They always use this kind of trick. Let him go! My daughter! I won't let other people hurt you. That hurts me very bad. He's not your mom. Didn't she commit suicide few years a go? "Don't listen to this awful person, " ...but listen to Mom. I will protect you. Mom, do you want to eat this fruit? Forget about Yi. Forget about Jun. Forget about that money. Ling. Ling. Let's go. Who are you actually? Are you a ghost?

The past believed… The presence believes… The futures believe… It's like a verse from a scripture. What is he trying to say? Don't be afraid. I'll accompany you to go inside. Jun! What's up? I… I…I can't do it. Help me, please. I can't help you. For this, you have to do it yourself. Have faith in yourself. Only left this step. Yi. Come out now! Yi. Give Jun back to me! Sorry.

It must be here! You are nuts! I said it's not here. Mum, call the front desk… ...to report trouble! Let me in! Get out! Let me in! Sorry. We have searched many times. Didn't find your bag. My bag was lost in your hotel. You just said you didn't see it. Want me to go away just like that. Isn't that irresponsible? We'll come again. I told you so. We come again next time. You guys stay in room 1174? Can you let me in to search… ...for my bag? Don't be nosy, let's go. Please! Pity her. Should we help? Dear. I think we have taken other people's handbag… ...by mistake. Ling, hospital just called. Jun had passed away. Ling, did you hear me? Ling? Don't scare me Ling. Ling? Jun had left me. There's no reason to hold on anymore. Let's end it now. Wait for me Jun. I'm coming after you. Don’t worry about it. We will try our very best. Thank you doctor. Ok. Are you Ling's friend? I'm her cousin. Who are you? This is my name card. (Psychiatrist Dr. Chen.) I have a general understanding of Ling's situation. If you don't mind. I would like to hypnotize her. What you saw. Are not all real. You chose what you wish to see. You always think that. You can't forgive yourself. The nurse was your own creation for self protection. To avoid reality. Don’t worry. She will recover soon. The patient is confused with everything she had experienced… ...seen or heard before. This is the so-called space-time disorder. Her brain will rearrange memories according… ...to her needs. Transforming it into new memories. Making her to believe those memories are true. To make herself feel better. 3, 2,1,… Wake up. Cousin. Why are you here? Ling. You're ok now. That's good! Dr Chen, thank you. If not for you I don't know when she would be awake. I'm the one who should be sorry. Sorry Ling. I took your bag by mistake. Ling. Dr Chen didn't take your bag on purpose. It was only a mistake. Your documents were in it. He has sent the money back to the company. I called your manager. He said since the money has been returned. So he won't hold you responsible. Ling. Let it go. And start over. Cousin. Ling... ...get in! Jun was an orphan. There is no one else to help him but me. You can let go. I will settle all his medical bills. No need, I can manage! Can you? With that little salary of yours. You think it's possible? Oh yes, I remembered. It's not totally impossible. You know accounting. You can rob your company's fund… ...or go gamble at the casino If you are lucky. You! What. Don't blame me. Blame your own self. Because you're a loser. Anyway, I'll go back the day after tomorrow. I will take good care of Jun. Sorry. I can't lose him. Call the police. I'm responsible. For Yi's death. Let's go out. Let her calm down.
