Come on, Cassie. We know this great after-hours club. You've been on your feet all day. - No, thanks. I have a day job too! - Sure I can't give you a lift? - I'm not a face for muggers. Come on. Give me your money! - Come on, Sweetheart. - Hey, hey... Let go of me! Officer! Officer! Officer! Officer! Officer! Oh, thank God it's you. These two Puerto Rican guys just tried to mug me... It was a cop, man! A big cop! - I hate the smell of these places. - Good morning! - So? - We have a C2, C3 fracture dislocation. The head was unstable and it was a sudden deceleration injury. As in hanging, where the head just pops. That's not what's interesting. We also have a crushed larynx. It's just floppy. You're trying to tell me two kids did this? I just got a statement from an eye witness who saw the kids attack her. Can't you cover her face? Her name's Cassie Philips. I used to go into her place for a nightcap. She always had the latest jokes, nice sense of humor. I always told her she ought to audition for one of those comedy joints. All the more reason I'd think you'd want to see those little bastards put away. Don't pass out on me, Lovejoy. Look at the size of those hematomas. You think one of those kids could have done that? - Shit, you really think a cop did this? - Why not? She knew me, she knew a lot of cops. What's the use, let's go! I think I need some fresh air. You must have been so afraid, Cassie. And you saw a cop. So we just about closed that club! You're not kidding... Watch the light! What's the matter with this light? Is it broken or something? Relax! What's the hurry? Shit, it's a cop, ditch the beer. - Where did he come from? - I don't know. All right, what seems to be the trouble, officer? - I think he wants you to go with him. - What for? I don't know, you've just got to cooperate, all right? I can't stand any more tickets. My insurance is going to go up. - Yeah? - Commissioner? Detective Lieutenant McCrae to see you. Send him in. Have a seat, Lieutenant. Lieutenant, I've been going over your report. Seems that you automatically assume it was a police officer instead of some lunatic son of a bitch dressed up like a cop. He didn't kill the girl, he wanted a witness. There you are, obviously someone trying to discredit the police force. It fits my profile for it not to be a cop. All the same, I think we ought to take a look at our own people. I'd like the police psychologists to do a run down on cops that have been under mental disturbance, attempted suicide, under extreme emotional stress... Sure, why don't we test the whole damn force while we're at it? Otherwise we're looking for a white man, over six feet tall, wears a police uniform, doesn't have an alibi. I don't know where to start to look, Commissioner. I want you to keep this within the department. Keep it quiet. For as long as we can. He'll kill again. He enjoys killing. Lieutenant, you seem to know a hell of a lot about this guy. Tell me, when was the last time you had a mental test? Anytime, Commissioner. As a matter of fact, didn't you try to shoot yourself a couple of years back? The gun went off. The gun went off. Ten days after your partner was killed in a line of duty, your gun just happens to discharge all by itself. You haven't been on an even keel ever since. Even now. You don't smile very much. Hey, what are you doing? This is my car! What the...? Help! Please help! Help me! Help, please! Please help me! Help, help please! - Help me, please! - Get lost, buddy! Help me, please! Help me, please! Please! Help! Please, help! What a surprise when you called. I didn't think we'd see each other again. I see you on the news at the end of each night, just before I shut off the lights. How romantic! Gina, this isn't about romance. It's about murder. Thank you. People have to be warned. Most people respect the uniform. They'll do anything a cop tells them, including walk up a dark alley. Who's he killing? Pushers, hustlers? Innocent people. Jesus! Maniac cop? How's that for a tag? I knew I could count on you to sensationalize it the best way. You got to do it. Make it bigger than AIDS. It's the only way to get City Hall off their ass. Are you ready to go on the line on this? Record it directly? I am ready to hand you an exclusive on this. I want you to break it on your news show tonight. I'll need a back up on every detail, names of the witnesses, specifics... You'll find everything you need right there. McCrae, remember, I owe you one. You don't owe me anything. Now, a news channel exclusive. This reporter was informed by a source within the New York Police Department of attempts by the homicide division to suppress facts regarding three recent homicides. Facts and witnesses to these murders point unmistakably to a uniformed police officer. A uniformed New York cop has been seen in the commission of the killings occurring on the streets of the city, after dark. The questions this station wants answered- Why has Commissioner Pike withheld these facts? Does the Mayor know what's going on? How can the public defend themselves if they're unaware that one of New York's cops may indeed be a psychopath whose intent is to kill them rather than protect them. Tomorrow on the morning show, we're interviewing Detective Lieutenant Frank McCrae... Damn! ...who's in charge of the investigation and was ordered not to speak to the press. You're not going to get me! Anyone wanting to shoot a cop nowadays has a hell of an excuse! - You believe that? - She thought he was the maniac! We've received over 700 letters accusing individual police officers. A cop gives you a parking ticket so what do you do? Naturally, write in a letter accusing him of being a killer, right? Why did this have to happen? I retire in four weeks. We're all in trouble here, Captain Tourism's off by 38%. This nut must be caught. It's costing the tax payers millions everyday. If you can't handle this, why don't you go for early retirement and step down? No way, I'm going to nail this bastard. Be sharp. Only one step ahead of me. If I stake out Tribeca and Soho, he strikes on the East side. He may be getting information from inside the department. That means he is one of us. I didn't know you were on duty tonight. With all the flu going around they had to put a lot of us on overtime. Always at night? It worries me when you work so much at night. It worries me too. You don't talk about it much. When I come home I want to forget! It makes me feel left out, Jack. You used to talk to me. You're the one that dropped out of the therapy. I was willing to go and pay the bills. So it's all my fault now is it? I did everything I could to hold this marriage together. You talk like it's already over. It's not enough to talk, you have to listen too. I suppose that's why you're taking so much overtime, to get away from me, unless it's something else. What's that supposed to mean? Sometimes you wake up screaming like you can't breathe. Sometimes I get afraid that you might hurt me in your sleep. Have I ever hurt you? I know it's wrong to be afraid of my own husband, but... No, why couldn't you simply say that to the therapist? "I'm afraid of him and I don't know why." No, Jack, please! Don't go out tonight! Stay with me. Now how can I? I'm on the duty roster. I'll make it up to you over the weekend. We'll go for a ride in the country... Hey, don't pull away from me. Sorry, I don't know what's happening to me. I don't like being alone till all hours, I hear things. I think I hear things. There's enough locks on the doors. You've got a gun and you know how to use it! Let me fix that for you. Look, if I get off early tonight I'll try not to wake you. You can wake me up. Maybe I'm just sleeping too much. They say that can be depressing to a person. You know, too much sleep? Be careful now! You say that every night. He went out again, didn't he? Who is this? Why do you keep calling me? Why does Jack keep killing people? Is he going to do it again tonight? Why do you keep doing this to me? - Hey, Jack! - How are you doing? It's no big deal, whenever you get a chance. No, I'll fix it myself. Why did you follow me? I thought... I was afraid that you were... God, I didn't want you to find out this way, I... I wanted to tell you but I didn't know how. - Don't come near me! - You have every right to hate us both. But let me just try and explain. I don't want to hear another word! Don't say any more, because I'll kill you both! Ellen, don't point that thing. Just don't point that thing. Let her go! Let her go! Jesus. You folks checked out yet? Oh... Must have partied out good in here. Let's see what other damage you've done. Item number nine. Remember gang, The Red Cross blood drivers next week. Let's do our duty. Item... - Forrest, let's talk! - Sure, Captain! Have you decided where you're going to settle down after you retire? Something about Florida? It's about your wife! Did she call about our trouble? I thought she'd be going to a lawyer or something like that. So you two haven't been getting along then? - Ripley... - Captain Ripley! Captain... since when is my personal life any of your business? Since your wife was found dead in a motel room! In a sleazebag motor inn on 11th Avenue, with her throat slit from ear to ear. No, you've got to be wrong. You want to see the pretty pictures? She ran out. I thought she went back home! You admit you were there! I tried to stop her but... she had a gun! Forrest, before you say anything else, I'd better read you your rights. You saving your reviews? I never saw these before. What about this? Your wife's diary. She wrote, "I now believe my husband may be doing these murders." Is that why you followed her and shut her up? - That's not true. - You got an alibi for Wednesday night, the preceding Friday? Huh? - I was home. - Come on, Forrest. If you were at home your wife would not have suspected you! All right, I was seeing somebody. I'll talk to my client now, alone. We've read him his Mirandas. He elected to make a statement. That's inadmissible. He admitted he was in that motel room in the presence of the victim. And that's enough. Now, you two guys, out of here! As you will, Counselor. Counselor, we intend to have this suspect appear on a line-up for the witnesses first thing tomorrow morning. Good day, sir. They're trying to make me the fall guy. Everybody's screaming for blood and all of a sudden I'm it! I'm certain you had no control over what happened. Call it irresistible impulse... that's a legal defense. Maybe you don't even remember committing the crimes... blackouts, momentary lapses of memory. I'm not crazy. I didn't do it! You were seeing a therapist on a regular basis. Come on, a marriage counselor! I've got a witness okay, somebody else who was there. I don't want to bring her into this unless there's no other way. You need all the help you can get. It's going to ruin her career. Let's give it till the end of the week, If they don't find the real killer by then, I'll name her. Yes so, I told my kids, "You see a cop, you cross to the other side of the street." I see a cop, I'm out of here. I've seen plenty of my friends murdered by cops - shot in the back, when they didn't have a gun or knife, claiming the suspect had a shoddy object. Cops like killing! That's why they're cops. Who's going to be next, huh? Cops like you to be scared of them. That's what makes them men! Real men. Because without the uniform, what are they? I'm not scared. They respected cops in my day, or they hit you in the head. They didn't take no gob, they were the law. Nowadays, I guess they've got to shoot you to get respect. Nobody gives crap to the cops since this crazy cop came along. You see a cop coming now, you get out of the way. Hey listen, about 18 years back I had a case where this guy made it look like a psychopath was at work. So what does he do then? He goes and kills his wife, and it looks like it was one of the serial killings. Jack's been set up to take the heat off the real psycho. Are you going to tell me you think this creep is that smart? - He's a cop, maybe even a detective. - Fuck you. Come on Ripley, why not? Every detective keeps his old uniform hanging in mothballs. It's the one thing you never get rid of. Now let me tell you something. If Jack had an alibi, he would have come across with it by now. Jack is protecting someone. Whoever it is, he doesn't want them to get involved. The killer knows who it is. - And you're a cop. - Fucking A, I'm a cop. - What the fuck are you? - Fuck you! - You're putting her in danger. - How? This guy wants to lay low for a while. Until he starts another killing spree. He'd like us to relax our guard. To accomplish that he hands us a prime suspect. - Why would he pick me? - Your size, your description, your personnel file. He's getting his information from inside the department. - And of course your sex life... - I'm telling you nobody knew about that. Your girlfriend must have told somebody, Jack. She's the only one who can give us that connection. That puts her in danger. I'm telling you, she can take care of herself. She out shoots me every time we go to the range. - She's on the force? - You know her, Theresa Mallory. Congratulations, it's a well kept secret. - Not well enough, according to you! - Where do I find her? She's on duty tonight. How you doing, beautiful? It all depends. Would you like a lift some place? I feel pretty much at home right here. Could I interest you in something else? You want to be a little more specific? You wouldn't be a cop, would you? You got it, mister, you asked the jackpot question. Why don't you run along home to your wife and kids like a good little boy. That's just what I was going to do, but I'll be thinking of you, baby. - I can't arrest you for that! - Ciao, baby. Who is it? Are you Malone? Hey, look. Don't get the wrong idea. I'm on duty here. Officer Mallory, 33rd precinct, vice squad. It couldn't have just been a bulletproof vest. I hit him in the head at least twice. Run me a tab, will you? Thanks. Look at the marks on your throat. I'm telling you, Frank, his hands were so big and they felt like ice, even through his gloves. He wasn't breathing. Well, we won't put that in our report, huh? Why did you come looking for me? You were Jack's only witness. You had to disappear. Did he speak to you? Say anything? No, not a sound. Last call, you want anything else? Yeah, one more round of doubles! - You're trying to get me drunk. - No, no. I'm going to stash you away for a few days, for safekeeping. Why can't I go home? If he knew where you were signed to work, he sure knows where you live. - How could he? You must have told somebody at work about your relationship. Come on, Jack was deliberately set up. Somebody phoned his wife to follow him. Who did you tell? I guess you know Sally Noland. - Should I? - She's been on the force for 20 years She's like a mother to all of us. She wears that leg brace. Oh yeah, she uses a cane. Sure, I know. Yeah, that's her. Her father's a cop. She's a fixture down headquarters. She's been there so long you hardly notice her any more. What's this? Key to my apartment, 4E. Lock yourself in there. I'll call before I come back so you know it's me. I'll ring twice, hang up, ring once again. Don't answer the phone for anyone else. Wait, I thought you were going to keep me company? I'll phone for a cab. I don't want you out on the streets. I'm going to stop down headquarters. I have a feeling Miss Noland will be haunting the joint. - What did you do to your hand? - Cut myself shaving. - Sign me in, will you? - Sure. You came at a bad time, the computer is down. How did we ever police this town without a computer, huh? You requested information. You'll have to fill out this form and I'll process it in the morning. You have a pen? Thanks. It'll be a hard time writing with this hand, I've got 11 stitches. You know, we really should know each other. We've probably been passing each other in the halls for years. We do have one friend in common. - Who's that? - Officer Mallory. - Theresa. - She had a close call this evening. Why? What happened? She was working undercover vice, ran into a psycho. It was a mess. - How is she? - She's okay. Thank Jesus for that. She's a fine girl, that one. I knew you'd be relieved to hear she was okay. Yeah, we should all have a beer together some time, get to know each other. - Sure! - We'll all be inseparable. - How's that form? I'll tell you the truth, it's not very important, forget it. Better get that computer fixed. I'm glad we finally got to say hello. I'm so glad you came tonight. You said you wouldn't show up. It's important that we talk about it... You've got to stop doing all these crazy things. You've got to remember to stick to your plan. Don't do this. Please. I know it would be safe if you put the girl away. But this way it's better. Now they think they've got the guilty man so that way they're going to let their guard down. You'll be free to get to the Mayor and the Commissioner and put an end to this. I know you had anger in you, Matt, but I thought it would be all the dealers and junkies and all the human garbage that you'd be cleaning the city of, not poor people just minding their business. What's got into you, Matt? What's changed you so? I said that I'd stick by you and I will, but you've got to stop this killing. Just, only save it for those that did wrong to you. Who's out there? Answer me! He's always just jumping. Matt? Matt? Where are you? I need you, Matt. You need me! Come back! Hey, you! What are you doing? Take it easy, what are you doing? I had to take a leak. Always take a leak with a gun in your hand? Good way to blow your balls off! Oh... You scared me, wearing a uniform. Everyone's packing a gun, I don't blame you. I should get hazard pay with this uniform. Yeah. You could have got yourself killed. Those timbers are ready to break! This place will be demolished in a couple of weeks. The whole city's going to hell. You can't pee anywhere any more. Here you are, more about Cordell than you've got time to read. He was my hero. Yeah, Matt believed in the old saying: shoot first and ask questions later. He was kind though, gentle enough if you got to know him. - Did you? - Well, I hate to admit it, but he used to like to come in here and look at his clippings. Just like you're doing. He kind of liked being a celebrity. A real shame about what happened to him. It was a crime what those politicians did to him, putting him in Sing Sing with criminals he'd been chasing all those years. It was like handing him a death sentence. They say he violated people's rights. I guess even killers have got rights. They murdered him, those bastards down at City Hall. He had no kids, no wife. I guess a 100% cop like him had no time for a personal life, huh? Here, you can put these away. You're wrong about that, he had himself a real nice girl. I think he'd have married if it hadn't been for that trouble. - You know who she was? - Sure! He brought her in here one time to show off for her. She wasn't much to look at, but nice. And of course, a cop. She must have taken it hard. Worse than that. Right after he was convicted, the poor soul threw herself out a window, trying to kill herself. A terrible thing for a Catholic girl to do. She crippled herself! Thanks, Clancy. They don't make cops like him any more. - He was one of a kind. - He still is! - What was that? - Nothing, forget it! We'll be interrogating the suspect for about half an hour. Okay, call me when you're through. - We know who the killer is. - Did you tell the D.A.? We tried to but he wouldn't believe us you won't either. Ever heard of Detective Matt Cordell? He was before my time but he was a legend, trigger happy. He died in jail. Suppose he didn't. Suppose he's back! Only now he kills innocent people. - How could he get out of prison alive? - We're going to find out. I've got an appointment with the chief medical examiner at Sing Sing. Why don't you continue this questioning for a while, alone? Rough him up a little bit. Thanks! Officer Mallory will continue the interrogation till I get back. Right. He knows! He knows! There's no stopping him because he knows! He knows you're here! He knows that I'm not going to do it any more, he knows! He knows. He knows I'm no good to him! He knows I'm no good to him! He knows, he knows! He's here, he's here! Stop it! Lean on me, come on! Walk this way! I'm not afraid to die, but to have to kill me when I love him so much? Why won't anyone answer? - No! No! - Put her down, Cordell! Put her down! Son of a bitch! No, no, stay there! Hey. what's the matter with you, didn't you hear the buzzer? What are you, deaf? Get his gun! - I got to get you out of this building. - If they see you with that gun, you'll get shot! - Don't worry about me. I've got to find McCrae. How did you get here? With McCrae! His car is still outside! Okay, here's a deal... get in it and wait. If we're not out in five minutes, hot-wire and haul us out of here. Go! Keep your hands where I can see them! Back up against the wall! I didn't do any of this! You broke out of your cell, you killed them all! - It was somebody else! - Shut up! - He's still here! - You're letting him get away! Nobody's getting away, I'm calling for back-ups! - Don't even try! - Okay. - Listen, I didn't do any of this. - Sure you didn't. Put your guns over there! All right, on your face, both of you! - We going after him? - You heard him, he didn't do it! Theresa, come on, let's go! Keeping McCrae's appointment at Sing Sing. Sure, walk into a prison with half the police force looking for you! - "You're brave!" - Not brave, scared shitless! Unless we can prove that Cordell is still alive it's going to be my ass. Step over there please. To your left. - Can I help you? - We've got a meeting with Dr. Gruber. - We're a little early. - You're name? McCrae, Detective Frank McCrae. The Doctor's office is round the back, to your left. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - You knew Matt Cordell? - There weren't many like that. I did they autopsy on him. The authorities knew something like that could happen to him. - Why didn't they prevent it? - They wouldn't allow it! He refused to be in isolation. I guess he didn't want to admit that he was afraid. - What do you do in a case like that? - What do you mean? When they're all cut up like that. This is no ordinary mortician's home. They we're not in to cause medic approaches here. When a prisoner dies, it's not our job to make him look good for his family. We stitch up the parts, put them into a wooden box and we bury him. Is that what happened to Matt Cordell? - I'd have to look in my records. - Would you mind? Mostly they just go to a potter's field. Here's Cordell's records. - His body was claimed by a woman. - May I see that? We both know Miss Noland. I think before this goes any further I'd like to see some identification, something with a photograph on it. Detective Lieutenant McCrae died early this morning. He was murdered. He was murdered by the same man that killed half a dozen people at police headquarters last night. I haven't got to my morning paper yet. No wonder you know all the lurid details. If I would have murdered a bunch of officers the last place I'd come is to a penitentiary. Don't bullshit us, you know who did those killings. - How could I know? - Cordell wasn't dead. And then you saved him. Answer me! Look, he was a fine detective. He had a lot of friends. Everyone knew if we put him back in the prison community they'd just attack him again. There was no way he could survive. So when they brought him up here more dead than alive, the policewoman convinced me to do the decent thing. Like remove him from the prison mortuary alive? He wasn't exactly alive! He had severe brain damage, I was certain that he was legally dead. I was telling the truth when I signed that death certificate. There's no way he could function as a human being again. - Read the newspapers, Doc. - Get out of my office. Now! You never came here. I won't pick up that phone. This never happened! There is no end to your decency... is there, Doctor? What did I do wrong? You should have seen him on the operating table, cut to pieces! I know the system screwed him. The politicians put him in prison and the inmates did the rest. Now you're trying to ruin my life and career. We're not trying to ruin anybody. We just want to bury Matt Cordell once and for all. Get out of here. Go away. Here you are Doctor, put this on. - What are you talking about? - You know it's St. Patrick's Day. The parade! The Mayor and Police Commissioner will be there. Yeah, along with 5,000 cops. I bet Cordell loved walking down that parade when he was on the force. Well, whatever he loved, he hates now. And so this year's St. Patrick's Day parade continues on schedule, despite speculation that it may have been canceled, due to fear of violence. Authorities report scores of death threats against the police plus threats of bombings along the parade route. But this has not deterred a record turn out for New York's 50th annual St. Patrick's Day parade. What a parade it is! Public outrage over continued killings by the so-called Maniac Cop have brought many hostile New Yorkers to 5th Avenue today. Police security forces and special bomb squads are out in full force as well as plain clothed detectives who are mixed in with the crowd. I can't walk in there, they'll shoot me on site. - I'll do it! - You have to get to the Commissioner. I'm to convince him these killings are being committed by a dead man! Commissioner Pike was Chief of Police when Cordell was sent to jail. He must be the one Cordell blames more than anyone. - Where are you going to be? - I'm going to be right here. So he says, "Commissioner, sir, that is my wife." Look who just walked in. Jack Forrest's girlfriend. All right, everybody out of here. - Where is the son of a bitch? - He's willing to give himself up. - After you listen. - So you're giving orders now? - I know who committed the murders. - So do we. Your boyfriend! You're wrong. It's a man named Matt Cordell. A ghost! Did you come up with this lunatic idea yourself or are you on drugs? It was McCrae's theory. But we verified it. Listen, last night before McCrae was murdered, he called my house. I wasn't there, I was at a charity event. But he was kind enough to leave a message on my service. Would you like to listen? This is Frank McCrae, I've got solid evidence this homicidal maniac is getting information from inside the department. His accomplice is a female employee, a policewoman. I'll be at the crime records division, waiting. Call me when you get in. Of course, he couldn't have been talking about you. - Policewoman! A killer's accomplice! - He's talking about Sally Noland! This is really great. You accuse a dead woman when the log states that you came to see Jack Forrest last night on alleged police business and you aided in his escape from the cell block. - You helped him kill all those people. - That's a lie! Why are you doing this? You know I'm telling you the truth about Cordell. Enough of this shit! I've got a parade to attend. You'd better go, sir. Everyone else has left for the reviewing stand. Wait, you may be in danger. Don't you understand? Cordell wants to kill you and the mayor. - Is that what Forrest told you to say? - If you have any sense, you won't go. Book her! Assess her for first degree murder. - Sit down! - What? I don't understand, I thought you were going to book me? Well, what's the rush? We've got the Commissioner's office to ourselves. We've got a place in Newburgh, me and the old lady... - I'm happy for you. - Commissioner, the tie... Never mind the tie, come on! Hurry up, we're late! Why don't you put a real feather in my cap and lay it all out for me? The reason behind those killings. It was extortion money, wasn't it? Money had nothing to do with those killings. It was an act of vengeance against the city. You know, the truth is darling, I could use a collar like this one. Come on, win me the big promotion. Make me a hero! If you're putting me under arrest, I want to see my lawyer. You've got a real rotten ass attitude. Fine, let's go, I'll take you downstairs. Don't give me any trouble, huh? This is great, I don't believe this. Everyone else is at the parade and I'm stuck here with you. Fantastic! You with your attitude really makes things nice. I'll tell you something else... Isn't that Forrest? Let's get him! - All right, there. - Wait, no, no, no! - No! - Damn it! Let go of me! Can't you see what the hell's going on up there? Listen to me! He's up there. He's in Pike's office. Don't you go giving any orders. I ought to put a bullet between your eyes and I'd be a hero! I'm the wrong guy! He's up there! Somebody inform his honor that this maniac cop has been recaptured. Hurry up, you're wasting time, The killer's in that wagon. Let's go! - You know how to handle a shotgun? - Get close enough and watch me! Vehicle last seen heading towards the river. The river? I think I know where he's going. - Yeah, sure! - Listen, do you know where Pier 14 is? Those pier's are all closed, they're collapsing. McCrae once tracked him to Pier 14. Hurry up! Hold on a sec, let me call for back-up! This is car 4604 requesting a back-up at Pier 14 right away! Let him go, Cordell! - Theresa, get these cuffs off. - The keys! Hold it there!
