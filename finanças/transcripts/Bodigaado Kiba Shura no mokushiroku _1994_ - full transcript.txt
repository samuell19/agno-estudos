If your brother sins, go and show him his fault, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you have won your brother over. If he refuses to listen, treat him as you would a pagan or a tax collector. I tell you the truth, whatever you bind on Earth will be bound in Heaven, and whatever you loose on Earth will be loosed in Heaven. Again, I tell you that if two of you on Earth agree on what you seek, it will be done for you by my Father in Heaven. For where two come together in my name, there am I with them... In position! Okay, Taipei - Jaren Ruins let's go! The time has come for us to make our move. This is why this school was created. This is why we have endured such hard training. I'm going to kill him. I thought I sensed a change in the weather. My holidays always end suddenly. Daito Karate Dojo Headquarters Natsuki Kirishima, age 25. So this girl is my new client? You're to take her to Taiwan and guard her there for a week. Apparently she's going to live with her lover in America, and they plan to meet in Taipei. Why Taipei? She said something about important business to attend to before meeting him. The award for one week's service is an incredible 20 million. Which means someone must be after her. That's my guess. I figure it will become clear as you guard her, so I didn't bother asking. After all, there's no job you can't do. Am I wrong? Right. Excuse me, Maki. Excuse me. We're too strong, so there's no one in Japan who will take us on. In order to support Daito Karate, we need money. The leader of the Taiwan branch, Shu, will meet you there. Do your best, Kiba. Yes. Master, Natsuki Kirishima is here. - Have her come in. - Have her come in. - Alright. This way. I'm Natsuki Kirishima. Thank you so much for your help in this. Apocalypse of Carnage Mulan watches the flowers... flowers will no longer be there once blown away by the autumn wind... This is Radical Mosquito. Kiba and Natsuki have arrived. This is delicious! Thank you, thank you. Next time I will cook something even better if you like... Shu from the Taiwan branch of Daito Karate has come to meet them. Everything is going according to plan. Things are looking good for us. Huh? Isn't today your birthday? It was yesterday. Yesterday? Really? I thought it was today! First, we will show you to the dojo. According to Mr. Daito, you will be much safer staying at my place than at a hotel. As for the escort, we have everything under control, so please rest. The branch dojo is located outside of Taipei and has around 90 students. l'm not sure if you know this, but l met with Mr. Daito Karate and was a great fan of his. Here we are. Daito Karate Taiwan Branch Please come in. This is Naoto Kiba from dojo headquarters, and Natsuki Kirishima. The two of them will be staying with us for the next week. Please don't miss this opportunity to spar with Master Kiba. - Right! - Right! Please use the guest rooms here. My room is in back and so if you need anything, just call. I warn you, I'm single and the place shows it terribly. Yes, thanks. I'll come back after practice and will show you to dinner. Please. You won't tell me who's after you. That doesn't really matter, though. But while you're in your room, you're to keep the door locked at all times. I'll keep my door unlocked. If anything happens, just call out or come get me. Alright. Welcome to the Guobang Hotel... Hey, you. My mother wasn't picky about her customers. She was a good whore! Who's there? Hey! Did something happen? Ah, never mind. Hey, Joe... Mr. Kiba... I'm sorry. Many against a few. There's no need to be embarrassed. My brother... You're really familiar with this area. What on earth is out here in the middle of nowhere? - Oh, what is that? - Oh, what is that? - Everyone, look over there! Let's go! Let's go! Shall we go back? Go back? That's enough for today. I know you don't want to talk to me, but let me say this. If you keep on hiding everything from me, you can't expect me to be able to guard you perfectly. But if you don't mind, then by all means, feel free to drag me all over Taiwan. None of them had a gun last night. These days in Japan, every yakuza has a gun on him. Greet your teacher. - Right! - Right! And each other. - Right! - Right! In position, start! Next. Right! Right! In position, start! Enough. He's strong. Try hard. He is best student in this dojo. His name is Sun. Well, Sun, try hard. Right. Next! When l told the trade company that helps support this dojo that you were here, they were extremely interested in meeting you. Do you think that you might be able to visit sometime? Maybe even tonight? Please, with Miss Natsuki... If you try to tell me you're going out again, that's impossible. Don't think you can treat me like this just because my mother was a whore! Mr. Kiba, Miss Natsuki. My boss, Mr. Wong. How do you do? Thank you for coming. Please sit down. Please. l've kept good friends with manager Shu. We admire him for learning Chinese martial arts and then changing to Daito to learn even more. I admire his steadfast ideal as an inter-trainer. If it weren't for you, I would have been nothing. By the way, how is Tetsugen Sensei? Do you know him? Oh, when I was young, I fought with him at Kowloon Castle in Hong Kong. You do bujitsu, too? That was many years ago. I was only playing. Then, Daito Karate was only one of the many small sects of karate. Now we have over 200 dojos in the world. I know that very well. Numbers are what make power. Now he made a big company. I'm sorry. I said a corporation. I'm afraid that when you work as a businessman, you tend to think of the money aspect. Please eat. I think this is the best thing for after dinner. Are you enjoying life? Me? Just in life. The end of one's life comes without warning. You never know, something might happen to you even as suddenly as tomorrow. That's the way it is. That's why I enjoy the present moment. Let's drink to the good life. It's showtime! Genryukan Dojo Headquarters 20 Years Ago Master! - Master! - Master! The shame of losing to me prompted him to take his own life. I thought I'd seen her somewhere before. Kasuga. Yes? I want you to get an urgent message to Ryo in Manila. What? Tell him to meet up with Kiba in Taiwan. Manila Government Counter-Guerrilla Field Base Okay, that's it for today's training. Ryo. This is from Japan. Japan? A helicopter's coming. We will be away from the hard work. You know, I'm gonna miss you. Me, too. Daito Karate Taiwan Branch Miss Natsuki, what happened? Why so late? I'm sorry. I can't take it anymore. I hate Daito Karate, too. They stole our mother's love from her and our peaceful life away from us. But... You're in love with Kiba, aren't you? Brother... Kiba was too much for them. You're the only one left. Looks like two generations have lost to Daito Karate, eh, Shu? Or, should I say Hideyuki Jonouchi? It's been 17 years since I first saw you. You had the eyes of a wild animal. Vowing to destroy Daito Karate to avenge your father and the Genryukan School, you left Japan and came here to train. You said learning Chinese martial arts was the only way to defeat Daito. - But look at you now. - But look at you now. - It's not over yet! I'll give you credit for infiltrating the Taiwan branch of Daito Karate, and then using your sister to bring Kiba here. But... I'm not doing this out of charity. You want to destroy Daito Karate, and I want to take it over, our goals just happened to coincide. That is why I helped you. But you've wasted my time and money. I'll take care of this my way now. After meeting Kiba last night, I realized it immediately. You're no match for him. Just give me one more chance. Sorry, but it's too late. Soon Kiba will be destroyed. What do you mean? I hope your sister's safe. You haven't eaten anything since this morning. Aren't you going to go out today? Go this way! Where is he? You sure are dedicated to your work. It's been a Iong time since I killed a girl. I think I'll take my time and enjoy it. What a lovely voice. Let's hear more of it. Bye-bye. A man's scream just isn't the same. Thank you for waiting. Damn it, those bastards! Long time, no see. Master Tetsugen sent me here to help out. Natsuki! Natsuki. Brother. So you're Natsuki's brother. You're the eldest son of Mr. Jonouchi, the man who drowned himself in the ocean 20 years ago, because of the shame of losing to Master Daito, right? That's right. Why did you do this? For revenge against Daito Karate? My whole life has been dedicated to this. For my father's honor, and that of the Genryukan School, I soId my soul to the devil. Wong, you mean? That day, my fate was sealed. Master! - Master! - Master! This was too terrible a fate for my sister. Leaving her and my mother, I came here to devote myself to avenging my father. I wanted to do this myself. My sister didn't even know where I was, but I sent her what little money I had. Two months ago, our mother died and I saw my sister for the first time in 17 years. At the funeral, I meant to watch from the shadows, but in the end, l couldn't resist speaking to her. It was then that I learned our mother hadn't told Natsuki anything about our father's death. I used her. She knew nothing, but I had her come here so I couId use her in my plan. And then she met you. Me? She's in love with you. I haven't asked your name yet. Hideyuki. Hideyuki Jonouchi. But why ask now? It's onIy polite to exchange names before a battle. Unfortunately, I'm not in any condition to fight. Ryo will represent Daito Karate in my place. Daito Karate never shows its back to the enemy. You worthless scum! You must find Kiba and Shu at all costs! - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. I will take over Daito Karate! I'm sorry I haven't been much of a big brother to you. But now that I've turned against Mr. Wong, you need to Ieave Taiwan as soon as possible. Your brother, Hideyuki. Brother... Come on. It's his sister. I'll follow her. What's the order? Let's go. Clean up this disgusting meal immediately! Hurry, let's go! C'mon, jump in! This is Radical Mosquito. His sister just got out of the car. Her location is... Brother! Natsuki! You have only seconds left to live! You needn't have wasted all that energy trying to save him. Them... Here's a message from Wong: ''Shu, as a present to your father in Hell, take your sister and the hated Daito Karate guy with you.'' You can call Mr. Wong... He can go and eat a loser's dinner in jail. Shut up! Let's go! Teacher Shu! Sun, what are you doing here? Kiba told us that you were in danger. Kiba. Hurry now. Sun will escort you to the airport. If only you... I'm your bodyguard, after all. Send payment to the dojo headquarters after you arrive in Tokyo. What's going on? Don't tell me you bums... What happened to Shu? Kiba? Then die trying. Kill him!
