- [interviewer clears throat] - [indistinct chatter] I think we are about to start. The camera is ready. [in Pidgin] Wait, wait, the camera... You mean they can already see us at home? - [women laugh] - They can see us? - Let's get ready. - [interviewer] Okay, so, uh... Okay, so... [clears throat] How did it all start? How did you summon the courage to do what you are doing? Well, Amina is our friend's daughter. So we just thought we should help any way we can. That's how we started. Knock knock. Auntie, good morning. Amina, how are you? Hope you're doing fine in your school work. - Yes, Auntie. How is Ngozi? - Ngozi is fine. She'll soon be back from boarding school. You'll soon see her. - Where's your mom? - She's in the room. Okay. Hey, neighbor! - Mama Ngozi. - How are you? I was just asking after you. I was in the room sewing Amina's school uniform. You're always sewing. Are you going to keep sewing for just Amina? You're good at sewing, so why not start a tailoring business? You're talking of starting a business when we don't have enough money for food. Can I start the business with just my thread and needle? Besides, I'm a trained teacher, not a tailor. You're just giving excuses. I know it's your husband holding you back. Baba Ngozi, don't you get tired? Go away! What kind of useless tiredness is that? Any man that marries a beautiful woman like you and gets tired is an idiot. [laughs] Let me show you that you are the woman scattering my brain and also the one rearranging it. Your sweet words help you! You know it's your sweet words that are helping you. Baba Ngozi, we just had sex! Come on. Hey! [laughs] [indistinct] [horn honking] [tires screeching] [wails] [wailing] Hey, hey! Mama Amina! Mama Amina! What happened? - [crying] I don't know, I don't know. - What happened? [Mama Amina] I don't know! - [Mama Ngozi] Sorry... - [sobbing] Can't you see? You're saying sorry. We'll have you arrested! Leave her! Sorry, put on your slippers. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. What is it? Why are you still crying? My sister, I'm not crying because of the accident. So why are you crying? Why are you crying? Say something. I hate this. Baba Amina has killed me! Baba Amina has killed me! What did he do? He wants to give Amina away as wife to an Alhaji! Amina! I don't understand. What did you say? Next week, Baba Amina says he'll give Amina away as a wife to an Alhaji. My child! Mama Amina, please tell me it's a joke! My child, what did I do wrong? What did I do? - Isn't Amina 13 years old? - Yes! Yes, my sister, can't you see they've killed me? I am dead. - Hey! - That accident should have killed me. Hey! What? Mama Ngozi, it's an abomination! What are you saying? Do you mean all the women alive are not enough? A man wants to marry a 13-year-old who hasn't even developed breasts? Hey! God forbid! You need to see how Mama Amina was crying and throwing herself on the ground. That's why I came late for work. The way she was crying, you'd think someone died. It's enough to cry as if someone died! Mama Ngozi, don't you know there's a disease that attacks children that are married off before they are developed? It's a big English word, I can't remember it. But they start urinating even when walking. - They smell like they're already dead. - Hey! It's a death sentence for these children. God forbid! If any man comes and says he's looking at Ngozi where she is, I'll kill the man so fast, he won't even believe it. I will just grab his penis and cut it! Mama Ngozi, this matter is making me upset. I'm even angry at my husband now as if he's part of committing this abomination. [man] Baba Ngozi, my guy, where are you? Bosco. Are you closing for the day? I'm tired. Business is a bit slow, so I want to go home to enjoy myself with my wife. Baba Ngozi! You're still on honeymoon with your wife! Do you have to pay for it? It doesn't get finished. You have it good. My wife is always pregnant, and every time she's pregnant, she's always tired. "I want to buy a malt. Please buy me an egg." [laughs] So who gets her pregnant? [laughing] My brother, you haven't allowed the woman rest. It's okay, go on! Baba Ngozi, are you making jest of me or you are hailing me? I'm hailing you! I'm off, but I will go one more round before going home. My wife will use the money to cook bitter leaf soup for me tomorrow. It's good. Keep hustling. I have a little headache. Do I cause headaches? Don't die on top of her! Don't die! You enjoy sex too much. Don't mind that useless Bosco. Always getting his wife pregnant. I don't think he knows what family planning is all about. You know not everyone understands family planning. You know he's illiterate. Am I literate? My husband, you finished high school. Isn't that an education? You told me Bosco didn't even attend elementary school. He's dumb! Meanwhile, my husband, I need you to help handle a situation. What is it? On my way to the market, I saw Mama Amina walk straight onto the road. She almost got killed by a car. She started crying, throwing herself on the ground. I was frightened. Why was she crying? She said Baba Amina wants to give Amina to an Alhaji as wife. [no audible dialogue] God forbid! That's why I'm talking to you. She said I should plead with you to talk to Baba Amina about it. We can't have this. Me? I can't! I can't do a thing like that. My husband, you say you can't? Mm-hmm. Why? Because it doesn't concern me. If Baba Amina wants to give his daughter away at this age, he has his reasons. I hate getting involved in something that doesn't concern me. A 13-year-old is about to be given away as wife to a man and you say it doesn't concern you? Baba Amina is the head of his home. Before taking such a decision, he would have thought it through. Men don't just make decisions. Mind your own business. Hey! This is what is spoiling Nigeria. We are all minding our own business. The Bible says we should be our brother's keeper. If we can't help our neighbors close to us, how can we change Nigeria? Baba Ngozi, how can we change Nigeria? Oh! So if someone comes when Ngozi turns 13 and says they want to marry her, you'll give her away as wife? That's how you know you married a madman! If you're talking, mind yourself. You can use yourself as an example. Leave Ngozi out of this. Ah! A man comes and tells me he wants to marry Ngozi at that age, is he crazy? - Oh? - Won't he be killed? Hmm! So it's good enough for another person's child, - but not good enough for yours, right? - Why are you talking too much? What did I say that's making you run your mouth? You want to gather the neighborhood for something that doesn't concern you? How did I run my mouth? Who heard me? [scoffs] Baba Ngozi, don't be this way. Eh? It's an abomination. Please think it through. You can't say it doesn't concern you, my husband. Please. It's okay. I want to rest. Let me sleep. I have a headache. It's okay. Let me rest. So someone will come and say they want to marry my daughter, and you'll be here. If there ever comes a time like that, you'll see what I'll do to you. Use your name as the example. Is that person crazy? Is the person mad? [Mama Ngozi exclaims] Please don't try it. Stay in your lane. Don't cross this! I'm tired of this issue. That's how they destroy this little girl's life. - Uh-huh. - [scoffs] And other small girls around. I saw on TV the other day... [scoffs] You and TV. I need it to keep up with developments in the world, so that when I've saved enough money, I won't be backwards in school. Anyway, as I was saying, I saw on TV that... What do they call those people? Aha! The senate was discussing the passing of a bill so these dirty old men can marry little girls. That's a lie! Christy, you lie! The people in the Nigerian government are so jobless that they'll start discussing such issues? Go on! Me? Lie? I swear! - Ask anybody who watched TV yesterday. - Didn't I say it? I said one day the monkey will go to market, but not return. - Hey! - So this is their problem? It baffles me. So with all the problems in this country, their concern is how to turn little girls into wives? We don't have electricity! Do we have electricity here? Nothing for a whole week. We don't even have good roads! Do we even have good hospitals? Weren't we all here when Mama Caro died during childbirth? Ah! Mama Ngozi, please don't remind me of Mama Caro. It won't go well for them! - [scoffs] - I've been saying that anyone who's stealing the money meant for the development of the country... - Holy Ghost! - [all] Fire! [scoffs] I've already stated my annoyance. Baba Ngozi refused to listen to me, his wife! I begged him to talk to Baba Amina. Since he refused, he'll suffer for it. What are you planning to do? I've gone on strike! What kind of strike is that? - I won't have sex with him anymore! - [Christy laughs] Correct! I love your style! I'm fully in support of you! Wait, Christy, you support what? How can you support her when you're not even married? Is it by marriage? It's a good idea! Please I support you! - I support you as well! - Correct! We should come together and teach these men a lesson! We're powerful! We just don't know we're powerful. - Just look at us women! - Yes! Uh-uh. Women! [all] Power! Mama Ngozi, what kind of pose is this? - It's the sign of the strike! - I like this style. I thought she saw it in a movie. Let's all do it! Women! [all] Power! [indistinct chatter, laughter] Baba Amina, what kind of good can come out of this? Good for the family! Can't you see how difficult it is to even feed ourselves? Let me get a job! At least I'm a trained teacher and I can sew. Let me do something. I know you're doing all you can, my husband, but your salary as a driver is not sustaining the family. So now you insult my job. I've already said no. Hmm? I'm not insulting you, my husband. I'm just saying it as it is. I want to contribute to the family. I can get a small stall in the market. I've said no! Alhaji will marry Amina. He'll put her in school. At least we won't have to worry about that. He'll also train Garba in school. But she'll be his wife! Don't you understand? She'll sleep in his bed. [no audible dialogue] How can that old man be sleeping with my daughter? Ah! Baba Amina, think it through. Please don't kill me. Eh? How could I go to bed at night knowing my daughter is not happy? Who told you she won't be happy? Hmm? She'll live in a big, beautiful house. Alhaji will take her around the world. Hmm? You should be glad that Alhaji chose Amina. [in English] He's a rich man. He's a very rich man. He can solve all our problems. So we're selling our daughter? I don't understand why you are so blind. Alhaji will marry Amina on Saturday, and that's final. [in Pidgin] I'm not even upset about that! Of course, Amina will marry in the end. She's already been betrothed to him. We can't even change that. I'm just saying she should get mature. She's not running anywhere. I promise! She should get to 18 when she's a woman. Alhaji will enjoy her more like that as a wife. And if a young boy defiles her before then? Alhaji will hold us responsible. And how do you expect me to hold my head up high in this community then? Hmm? [sobbing] My beautiful wife. Come let me feel you a little. I've been missing you today. My husband, I can't! You and I just finished eating now. Laughing, eating and joking. What's annoying you? Annoyed? I'm not annoyed. Do I look annoyed? Nothing's wrong. I just can't. Don't be upset. Good night. What sort of nonsense is this? Paulo! Turu, where is your boss? - He's over there. - Go fetch him. Go fetch him! Nonsense. I can't take this. What rubbish! They formed a club. - Paulo! - Cali? - Warn your wife. - Huh? Paulo, warn your wife to leave my wife alone. - What is it? - She should leave my wife for me. What did my wife do to your wife? Tell me that. Warn your wife. You know I'm on my own and I don't look for trouble. But anyone who upsets me, they'll know I'm from Warri. You know me, I will scatter! You still haven't said what my wife did to your wife. Warn your wife who thinks she's more knowledgeable than everyone in the neighborhood! Warn her because if I unleash my own trouble... Stop it! Don't insult my wife. I don't joke about my wife! Don't insult her! I didn't insult your wife. I didn't insult her. But you have to warn her, because your wife started a useless club where they're on strike and won't have sex with their husbands anymore. My wife started a club? - You don't know? - I don't know. Are you sure you know what you're saying? Oh, so your wife is having sex with you, while my wife has foolishly followed her to say they're on strike. Okay... - Cali. - Mm-hmm? Even my wife has refused to have sex with me! I didn't know they started a club. I didn't know. - You don't know they started a club? - I didn't know! Your wife started the club! She started it! Warn her to scatter the club immediately. If not... No, please don't threaten my wife! No! If we have any issues, we should settle it man to man. Don't bring my wife into this matter. We are not kids. - Your wife started the club. - We are not kids. She should scatter the club! My wife is still on strike. Every time I want to have sex, she'll say they are on strike. I want to have sex and I must have sex. If your wife doesn't scatter that club... Cali, my wife didn't force your wife like a kid. - Something will happen! - Is your wife a kid? - You know who I am! - Is your wife a kid? This man doesn't know I'm suffering more than he is. This woman's going to kill me. Okay... I don't understand how your husband can't see this matter the way it truly is. I've already given up. I'm just praying now, because I've given up. I really believed your husband would help, that he would talk to Baba Amina. As he couldn't do it, I've given up. - You shouldn't just give up like that. - My sister, what do you want me to do? Huh? What should I do? You should fight for your child! Huh? - Didn't you give birth to her? - [exclaims] You know, as things have happened this way, if anything happens to Amina, you won't be able to forgive yourself. - Right? - I can't lie. You're also to blame. What did I do? How could you just sit at home and not do any work? Huh? How could you not support your husband? Why wouldn't you find a little cash to start a small business? Don't you know that your husband's behavior is motivated by money? But, let's be honest, it's not her fault. My sister, you wouldn't understand. You see, my husband, he believes a woman's place is to sit at home and look after children. [scoffs] So you'll look your children in the face until they die of hunger? God won't support you on that. My sister, as we're talking right now, my children haven't eaten since morning. I left the house to go to the market to buy something to cook, but my money is not enough. Everything is so expensive, everything! Ah! I don't know what I should do. This is what gets me so upset with you. You don't listen! How many times will I tell you? I've told you many times, if it gets that bad, just come and ask me. It's not that we're rich, but children shouldn't be hungry while we're around doing nothing. It's not good! You should always speak up. I don't like this. I get so tired of you. Things are so expensive. Things are costly. I don't want to burden you all. Take, take! Add to what you have. What I wanted to give you isn't even up to what you just got. It's not yet my turn for contribution. Help me give to the children, so they can eat. - Since we cook for a living. - Thank you. Madam 12:30, thank you. Thank you all. God bless you all. God will bless you all and your businesses. - You're welcome. Amen. - Let me take this to my house so the children can start eating before I start cooking. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you... - Hey! - Can you see how men are? A woman that even has an education. He doesn't let her get a job or start a business. - [Paulo] Mama Ngozi! Mama Ngozi! - What is it? What's this nonsense I'm hearing that you started a club? Club? Which club? Who's telling this story? Okay... That's why you refused to have sex with me, right? Baba Ngozi, please leave me. Is that why you're fuming? What happened? It's nothing serious. It's just that we women have agreed to go on strike. That's all. What nonsense strike is this? What are you striking about? [scoffs] It's just a small matter of men these days being more attracted to little girls of 12 years, 13 years... Even the government has enacted a law that men can now marry little children. So we decided that if the men prefer little girls, they should leave us old women alone. That's all. Have I left you to go after little girls? How does that concern me? No! How does it not concern us? Don't try to play innocent here! Didn't I beg you to talk to Baba Amina the other day, and you refused? Didn't I beg you? Stop pretending. It concerns both of us very much. Only now I understand that madness has got into your head. [laughs] Cali, haven't I been calling you? Why do you look like a frog is licking your face? [coughing] You're not talking to me? So, as my body is now on strike, your mouth has joined the strike? We can't talk like husband and wife in this house again? - Jemima. - Hmm? - You know how much I miss your body? - Mmm? How do expect me to survive this nonsense strike you're all doing? Huh? How do you expect me to survive? Cali! Please don't call this strike nonsense! This strike is sweet to me! Haven't you taken my body for granted? But since this strike started, your eyes have been darting around and following me. That's how I've been looking at you ever since. It didn't start today. But you know what? Jemima... [both singing] I'm not laughing with you. Don't touch me! We're on strike! - Just give me a little... - No, no! - Just... - Stop, please! - Just give me... - I said we're on strike. - Nobody will know. - You want to die? Hey! Cali, if you just die, you know what will happen? You'll just be in your grave, looking, and another man will carry me away. Hey! - Jemima, just give me... - Don't touch me! Can't you hear! Nobody will know! Will you tell them? It's like I'm lying. [Paulo] You're already here. - Yes, we've been here. - Okay! Paulo, Welcome. How are you? How are your people? Fine. Um... Come. Give me any cold beer there. There's a problem we were discussing before you came. The matter concerns you very much. [Paulo] Oh. Thank you, thank you. What's the problem? Paulo, the problem is that Calistus says that your wife started some kind of club. You know that my wife doesn't sell in the market. Even Ade's wife's friend has joined the club. Calistus has started again. Calistus has started again! You all should leave me alone about this club issue. So my wife started a club! So what? Did she force any of your wives to join? Are they children? Can't they think for themselves? You say? - Eh? - Calistus! Paulo, I warned you to ask your wife to stop that club, didn't I? It seems you didn't warn her. Calistus, don't be spreading rumors about my wife and I. - It seems you didn't warn her. - You're a man, not a woman that gossips. I went to his shop and asked him to tell his wife to scatter the club. But he didn't warn her. It seems Paulo is making some sense here. [Paulo] Oh! I know my wife very well. No one can force her to do what she doesn't want to do. She's a strong woman! But that doesn't make it okay for Paulo's wife to just start that wicked club. It's not good that your wife believes she knows too much, that you can't control your wife. Calistus. If my wife is an opinionated woman, then your wife is dull! - She can't think for herself! - You say my wife is dull? Yes! So you think that your wife's big hips means big sense? You're crazy! - You're too hot tempered. - Do you think a big arse is sense? - Do you think a big arse is sense? - You're crazy! Which kind of husband are you? [all shouting, indistinct] Your wife is senseless. Amina. [in English] Look, I know you're unhappy. Okay? I am too. Believe me. It's not my will that you go with him, but your father thinks it's in your best interest. Alhaji has promised to send you to a better school. When you get there, make sure you read and excel, okay? Mommy, save me! I wish I could. I really wish I could. - But I will die. - What? He's going to kill me. You said it yourself. Just like when Zainab got married. - She died. - Stop it! Stop it! You will not die. People have different fates. Your fate will be different. Okay? You be strong. Be strong for me. Take this. [sniffles] If it gets unbearable, make sure you call me. Will you come for me? If it's the will of God, my daughter. If it's the will of God. Eh, my wife. Your in-laws, they are ready to go. Please, bring their wife for them. [indistinct chatter] Very good choice, Alhaji. [chattering, indistinct] [whooping] [woman singing in foreign language] [singing continues] [Mama Ngozi] In this area? It can't happen here. It's not happening! We will scatter everywhere today! We will gather the area boys! Who are these people? Get away from here. [no audible dialogue] This area? No, we won't agree. [no audible dialogue] Women, please leave my way. We need to pass. Pass to go where? Sir, where do you want to pass to go? What's going on here? Please tell these people to leave my way. Madams, please. Get out of the road and let my visitor pass. Visitors? These aren't visitors! They're thieves! Thief! I beg your pardon. Me? A thief? Yes, you're a thief! Is this not stealing? If it wasn't stealing, why do you want to take a 13-year-old child? What do you want to do with her, if not theft? You think we don't know? - Madam, please. I'm respecting you. - [scoffs] This has nothing to do with you, for goodness' sake. Wait, wait, wait! It has everything to do with us. - This girl is our child too. - Yes! Do you know how many times we gave her a bath? I still give her a bath at her age! A child who hasn't yet finished growing up and you want to take her to do what? - We should call a mob action for you now! - Area boys? They won't be so civil to you when they come. Thief! [whooping, clamoring] [rock guitar theme plays] In Bizarre News, our folks spoke for a while on the street earlier today and contacted some very local women who, interestingly, were trying to stop the marriage between a 13-year-old girl and a man well into his 50s. [Baba Amina] Let my visitors pass. [Mama Ngozi] Visitors? These aren't visitors! They're thieves! Thief! [Alhaji] I beg your pardon. Me? A thief? Yes, you're a thief! Is this not stealing? If it wasn't stealing, why do you want to take a 13-year-old child? What do you want to do with her, if it isn't theft? You think we don't know? [cheering] [in English] There you have it. Those market women are not having it. They have decided to fight, in their own little way, for what they believe is a great injustice to a girl child. Oh, my goodness. Those women are brilliant. They are not afraid to speak up for what they believe in. They are so outspoken. [sighs] They're doing what you and I should be doing: Speaking up. Let me interview them on your show. Why would you want to do something as stupid as that? What is stupid about wanting to do the right thing? I want to do something for myself. Vera, need I remind you that your husband is a senator? And that you need his approval before you can say or do anything in public? Sweetheart, I am tired of being the wife who smiles and waves. I want to do something for myself. I want my voice to be heard. Look, your loyalty lies with me and not my husband or his party. Make it happen. [upbeat music playing] [indistinct chatter] [in Pidgin] He tried. How do we handle this problem? I'm tired. If Paulo had been able to convince his wife to scatter the club, - it would've been better for us. - Mm-hmm. Since they got on television, it's gone to another level. My wife doesn't let me rest. Even my neighbor's wife has joined the strike. See, I have decided. I will continue to beg my wife. If she can only give me just once, give me just once, so I can relieve myself of all this stress in my body. As for me, I'm tired. In fact, I've given up. Don't give up. - Do you know what I want to do now? - What do you want to do? It's pay as you go. Sexual tension is a bastard. Cali, my brother, I'm going with you. You're going? Okay. I can't continue in this state. - You also do that kind of a thing? - What does that mean? Is it written on anyone's face? Stop it, please. Calistus! You want to go with a prostitute? - Don't say it like that, please. - I'm disappointed. You're disappointed? When your sexual tension reaches its peak, you will speak Igbo by force. I'm coming! - Oh! - [all laughing] - Francie, baby! - Customer! Hey! Ah! My friend and I came to greet you. - We're brothers. - My friend Bosco. [all laughing] What's up? Aren't your friends around? One of my fine friends is inside, Caro. You know her, don't you? - Oh, the big hips! Is she around? - Yes, she is. - That's my own. - I know those are your specs. You know what I like. Let's go inside. Uh-uh. Wait. Why are you stopping us like this is the presidential villa? What do you want to do inside? Are your boxers inside? Relax... - Oh! - [both chuckle] It's money time. - My friend, bring your own money. - [muttering indistinctly] - Is this a contribution? - It's a combined service, my sister. - How much did you bring? - It's 1,000 naira. That's all I have. - You'll go a little. - We'll do the same. You'll go just a little. I'll go full. That's how much your money can pay for. Okay. This is for you and Caro. - Well done, guys. - No problem. You know that's how we do it! [all laugh] Okay, let's go in. You know what, you guys cannot go inside because women are on strike. - Hey! - What kind of strike is that? - When did prostitutes become wives? - Wait, what did you just say? Take a look at me. How is your wife better than me? Forget this strike nonsense. You don't need it. I will not forget the strike, because as all these old men now prefer little girls. That will affect our business in the long run. So we've shut down. Since you knew this beforehand, why did you take our money? Now, give us back the money before we get upset. Customer! Cool down. I'll keep it for you for later. - No, no, no! - You'll come for the service later. No, give us back our money. I'll take it from you with my hands. - Is this a bank? - I'll put my hands on you to take it. - Don't try me! - Give us the money! - I don't have. - Baba... So what do you want me to give the children to eat? You should've thought about that before you sent your thugs to run and chase Alhaji away. Are we still discussing that problem? The money you gave me since the beginning of the month is finished. I've been managing the leftovers since then. What do you want me to do? Hmm? You just have to wait till I get paid. I can't... I can't steal. So let me just find work to do. At least if I do something, we could have a little more money... Mama Amina, please. Please! Don't go there. A woman's place is in the house. That's how it's been in our families. Don't get me upset today, please. Don't be angry with me, my husband. I didn't mean to. But I was just thinking about it. Even though you have this rule, but since you've bent the rules, saying we should give away Amina before she matures, then maybe you could also bend the rules so that I can also go out and get a job so I can... I said I don't want to hear it! My wife will not take care of this home! Oh. But our daughter can take care of the home? Bosco, if you hadn't held me back, - I would have dealt with that girl. - [laughs] Look who's talking! You're the one who held back, that's why I left that girl. You ran away when you saw that big lady, Caro. - Run? - [Bosco] What was pursuing you? You should have waited, so Caro would sit on you with her heavy behind and knock you out. - Calistus ran? Why? - Ask him. - You know the heavy wife he has at home? - [exclaims] Have you seen Madam 12:30? Who can have bigger hips than Madam 12:30? Heavy beautiful hips is what this guy has at home. Leave the hips for me. I like it like that. [laughs] You see, I know what I'll do. What will you do? I will go and buy a beautiful gift for my wife. I happen to know what she likes. - What does she like? - What does she like? Say it. What are you going to buy? She likes sweet-smelling perfumes. If I give her that gift... - My wife. [laughing] - [no audible dialogue] This guy can succeed in this thing. As soon as I give her that. You know what? I don't think I know what my wife likes. - What does she like? - The last time I bought her a flower... You bought her what? Flower! Do you know what she asked me? She asked if she was a goat. [all laugh] Let me tell you my own story. My wife? She just wants money. Every woman likes money. If I go out to buy her a beautiful gift that women like, she will say I was cheated. She insists I should give her the money so she can go and buy it for herself. Yes, I now know what I'll buy for my wife. - What? - What? I will... No. I won't tell you guys. - Please, tell us. - Paulo, don't play that way. No! If I tell you guys, you'll go buy the same thing. So, for telling you guys my own gift, I'm the fool? Look. If we all bought the same thing, they'd know we all planned it, and we'd be found out. That's true. - That's true. - That's true. You've made a good point. Looking at how these women have united in their strike. We need to strategize. You understand? [Paulo] ♪ My good wife ♪ ♪ My good wife ♪ ♪ What will I do? ♪ ♪ To love me ♪ [chuckles] ♪ I will cook you soup ♪ ♪ Buy you a beautiful gift ♪ ♪ What will I do ♪ ♪ To love me ♪ My husband, welcome. My beautiful baby. - I bought you a present. - Ah! Today isn't my birthday. Why do you talk like a village girl? Is it only on birthdays that presents are given? My husband, it's only on my birthday that you buy me presents. But what did you buy me? I bought you a wrapper that you've been admiring ever since. Hey! Hey! My husband, hey! [laughs] I'm now rich! Hey, thank you, my husband. I appreciate it. [exclaims] My husband, thank you. I appreciate it. Let's go inside... Huh? Let's go inside. Oh! Is that why you bought me the wrapper? Ah, that's a wrong move. That's not possible. You know we're on strike! My sweetie... Why are you doing this? Forget this strike. You know I've missed you. You've missed me, or you've missed sex? Both of them. My honey, let me get a cold bath ready for you so that your body can cool down. [scoffs] This is wickedness. This is wickedness. How is this wickedness? How is this wickedness? You guys should go tell the government so they can do the right thing. Ah! - Please, let me take my wrapper and go. - This, your wickedness. Hey! What kind of shamelessness is this? Because I said wouldn't do it, you won't give me the present? [all laughing] That's what I sprayed. Can't you see how good I smell? [laughing] A scent. These men! Cali bought me a cake yesterday. I sat down and had my fill of cake. Madam 12:30. I wonder about you! - Why didn't you bring some for us? - Uh-huh! Don't tell me you submitted to your husband after eating cake. Submit what? Don't you trust Madam 12:30? Not only submission. Nothing like that! [all laughing] - [Mama Ngozi] I don't trust you! - Correct, correct, correct... Huh? Mama Ngozi, there's someone at your shop. Hey, customer! I'll be right back. Customer... [indistinct chatter] Fine customer, what do you want to buy? I have beautiful fabrics inside. - Good afternoon. How are you? - Good afternoon. Which one do you... I don't really want to buy anything. I came to see you. See me about what? - It's about the strike. I saw you on TV. - Ah, okay. We just want to do our bit to help the situation. That's all. It's all right. - And that's very good, very fantastic. - Thank you. What you're doing is going to change the lives of little children all over the nation, especially girls, yes. That would be good, so our strike won't be in vain. It won't be in vain, my sister. It won't. I want to give you a voice. I want everyone to hear what you are doing. I want you to be interviewed. - Really? For TV? - Yes, it's a talk show. I want all the other women talking about the origin of this strike. Ah! Okay, no problem. But I have to tell the other women, because I'm not alone in this. - I know. Really, okay. - I will talk to them. Um... - Here's my card. - Okay. Um... Think about it very well and then call me at this last number. Okay, okay. No problem. - I'll be waiting to hear from you. - No problem. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Won't you at least look at the fabrics? - Don't worry, you know I'm wearing... - I even have this one you have on. - I know. We'll get to that. - Let's just start with that first. - Okay, all right. - You'll be my customer. - Fine customer! - Thank you, ma. Okay. - All right, take care. - My regards to the other women. - All right, ma, thank you. Hey! I want to try and put everything in a better perspective so you understand. I want you to understand what's on ground. There's already a Child Act which outlaws underage marriages in Nigeria. It's just that some states are yet to implement that. [muttering, indistinct] So, are you saying that there's already a law that stops older men from marrying underage girls? Exactly. It's just that some states have yet to accept the law? - Exactly. - [Mama Ngozi laughs] Mama Ngozi, can't you see? What you mean is the law is there, but the government members who wrote the law do not want to obey it. The same law they want ordinary Nigerians to obey. Don't you see? So that's just what I wanted you to understand so that you know exactly what you're in on. Besides that, I want to let you know that I am so proud of you. And I believe every Nigerian woman is also proud. Thank you. What I have deduced from this conversation is that... we are meant to strike against the government for refusing to obey the law, right? As they have put out a law, they must obey it. This strike of ours, Mama Ngozi, it's bigger than us. - I told you! - Hey! [all laughing] Okay. So, what is the way forward? We'll keep it up! - Till they agree. - We have locked up! Women... [laughing] So, that's it, folks. [laughs] Lock up. You like our pose, right? I really like the pose. I think I'll try it at home. Mama Ngozi came up with the pose. [laughter, chatter] [laughs] This thing you all are doing, it seems... See how beautiful I look there! [Madam 12:30] There's no such thing. We will fight it till the end. [Mama Ngozi] We'll see who gets tired. Us or the government. I'm happy the government officials are mostly men. - It's affecting them a lot. - [laughing] Nigerian women. What if the power authority cuts off power as we're watching? - Why are you saying that? - So you didn't find anything else to say? I'm joking, I'm joking. Don't crack such jokes when you know the power authority could be listening! [Mama Ngozi] You were even waving? Who are you waving at? I'm waving at my people at home. - You know everyone has seen us on TV now. - [Mama Ngozi] Yes. So tomorrow when going to the market, we have to dress up nice to prove to everyone that we're now on TV. We won't mind anyone! There will be so many customers in your shop. We've become small celebrities. Celebrities! You'll see what will happen. I won't wait for 12:30 tomorrow to start selling. [Christy] Your shop will be full. Hey! I will be constantly selling my fabric... [all laughing] [women on TV] Women... [Vera laughs on TV] So, that's it, folks. Lock up. [chattering on TV continues, indistinct] Vera! What have I done to offend you? Honey, you haven't done anything. What are you talking about? Why would you humiliate me like this? This is good. We're doing this for the good of the people. - For the people? - Yes. Did you stop for one minute to think how my party would react to this madness? How could you go on national TV and discuss something as crucial as this without consulting me first? This is good. Trust me. - You just have to... - [cell phone rings] Hello, sir. Yes, I did, sir. I'm very sorry, sir. Yes, sir. I will deal with the matter straightaway, sir. Not at all, sir. I am going to say this just once. You will put a stop to this madness. I don't want to hear about this issue ever again. This is the last time. Put a stop to it. I don't want to hear it at all! Don't you know people are laughing at me? Who's laughing at you? Why are they laughing at you? Are we doing something bad to make them laugh at you? Can you imagine? I've become a man who can't control his wife! I don't know why you can't stop this useless strike. - Baba Ngozi, I don't have time. - Your waist is thinner from this strike. I don't have time for this. I'm off to the market. You're supposed to be at work. I don't know what you're doing at home. [Paulo] Your trouble won't let me go. Good day, madam. We are here to get some information from you... [muffled clamoring] [Paulo] What is it? What is it? Good day, sir. We are here to get some information... Who are they? How should I know? How should you know? You don't listen when I speak. Isn't that a news crew? - How should you know? A news crew? - So? They followed you home! You see? They followed you home! So what if they followed me home? Do I have anything to hide in this house? If you have nothing to hide, why did you slam the door? Are they spirits? Are they spirits? I'm not running from them. I was just shocked. Why would I run? Did I kill anybody to warrant running? What kind of temptation is this? What kind of temptation is this? Look. I want to go to work. If you know how to clear these people so I can be on my way, do it. - I'll go to them. - Clear them! I'll go to them. I'm not scared. Why would I be scared? I'm not scared. [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [in English] Vera, listen to me. You are not going anywhere. I forbid you from going anywhere! You cannot stop me, Aniti. As a matter of fact, you will not stop me. What's the matter with you, Vera? I mean, you're much more enlightened than these village women you're dragging these child-bride issues with. Issues that haven't been specifically address in the House yet. Yes! But it is implied by the law on ground, which should have been properly amended to protect the child. Instead, they conveniently leave the old law, giving room for anyone to interpret it to suit... guess what... the marrying off of underage girls. And why aren't the states compelled to implement the Child Act laws, which... Now, listen to me! You are not going to ruin all the hard work I've put in place to get us to where we are today. Do you understand me? Do you know how many years I've toiled... Hey! We toiled. Who gave you those pep talks when you felt like quitting many years ago? Who massaged your shoulders late at night when you got back from working so hard? Whose shoulders did you cry on when you lost anything? Don't you give me that line of toiling alone, because you didn't! What I'm doing might be bad for your party, but trust me, it is good for your conscience. I am going upstairs to change for the interview I was invited for. Have a good day, Senator. Vera... [laughs] Vera! - [Calistus] Paulo? Paulo? - [muttering, indistinct] - Paulo, are you there? - Yes. Okay, wait. See what I've been saying? Here it is! - This is what I've been screaming about. - "Wives on strike." - These women will not be the death of us! - Isn't this what I've been talking about? These women will not be the death of us! They won't be the death of us! My house was full of reporters this morning! What kind of unnecessary exposure is this? These women have refused to listen! [exclaims] Paulo, this law the government is talking about makes no sense. How can they say it's okay for an old man to marry a 13-year-old? It doesn't make sense. Cali, I usually don't like talking about other people's issues, but this problem is beyond me. Of all the problems in this country, why is this of interest to the government? Why? [upbeat music playing] [no audible dialogue] [rock guitar theme plays] [English] Coming all the way from Africa is a very interesting piece of news. Women across the entire nation of Nigeria, the most populous black nation, are on strike. But the question is: why? According to the report, it is to protest a Senate decision not to change a clause in a section of the constitution, which somehow can be interpreted to legalize underage marriage. Hmm. But the most fascinating part of this report is this: The strike action was initiated by some uneducated market women, who realized that they needed to do something to help a girl child. Fascinating. What are their demands? They demand are that the Child Act, which outlaws underage marriages, should be implemented in all the states of the federation. Huh? - But the real question is this... - On top international news? Will this strike action change the minds of the individuals at the helm of affairs? My name is Tim Careyway. This is the Action Room for DNN News. Stay tuned for more. - Drinks are here. - What did I just see? - Where? - The issue has gone higher! What issue? What happened? I just saw a report on international news! This thing has gotten more serious. Sir, I'm selling petroleum jelly. Who's that? When have you started selling creams here? Since all the wives have gone on strike, we've been selling petroleum jelly. Hey! It's an insult. What do they do with it? That's what all the men now use, sir. That's what they use. - [Paulo] All men, what? Me? - Take it away from here! Sir, it's almost finished. I'm holding the last ones. I said take it away from here! - [Bosco] Didn't you hear him? Leave! - Why are you behaving this way? [Bosco] I said leave! Take it away! Leave! So, you see the insult? I'm going to my patrons. No problem. [Bosco] Please leave here! [laughs] Look at her! This thing is now on another level! We're being sold petroleum jelly! - [laughing] - Hey! See, she came to advertise petroleum jelly! [woman on TV] What I find very interesting is the fact that these illiterate women have the full backing of well-educated and influential women across the nation, including the wife of a senator, Mrs. Vera Isong. Mrs. Isong is at the forefront of the campaign. Interestingly, her husband and his party seem to be at the forefront of not amending the clause in the constitution. Mrs. Isong declared in an interview that she's fully committed to this campaign and will not back down until the government adheres to the voice of the women. In entertainment news, the Nigerian artist popularly known as... [upbeat music playing] We cannot have this. You must call her to order, or you will not like the consequence. Do you know how bad this makes us look? Look, I am very, very sorry about this. But I promise you this is the end of this issue. That was what you said after the first interview! Do something about it right away. Or we'll do something about it. Gentlemen, have a good evening. Where are you coming from this night? Are you crazy? Don't ask me such a stupid question! - You've had a lot to drink, right? - If I had some drinks, so what? - So what if I had some drinks? - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? At your age, you go drinking until you get drunk. If something happened to you, what would you do? If you fell in a ditch, what would you do? Mama Ngozi, don't insult me. I'm not your mate. - Don't insult me. - What has mate got to do with this? You shouldn't talk rubbish to me because I'm calm. - Shh! - I'm calm! People are asleep, keep quiet! This is my house. Don't tell me how to talk in my house. I will talk however I want! I can see you aren't all right today. I'm off to bed. Can't you show some respect? Baba Ngozi... Eh? Were you about to hit me? I ask you, were you about to hit me? Hey! We've been married for so many years and you've never hit me. You already know I'm crazy! The day you hit me and tell me it's the work of the devil, when I finish dealing with you and the devil, you will testify yourself! Mouthful. Mouthful. [exhales] [burps] [in English] Vera, when are you going to stop this child-bride rubbish of yours? - Do you want me to lose my job? - Yes! If your job is going to turn you into a monster, you're better off without it. Better off without it? - After years of toiling? - Go! After years of toiling, you want to flush everything I've worked for down the toilet? Vera, you're bored. I understand. Pick up a pet project. Have a baby. Better still, get a dog. Leave my career alone! Aniti, you are not the man I married. The man I married was kind, loving, and cared for people. The man I married went into politics because he had a thing for the people, he loved the people. What has... What happened to you? Why have you sold your soul? You know, I would've been better off being the wife of a lawyer. At least that lawyer had integrity, that lawyer cared for the good of the nation. Aniti, you are my husband, and I love you very much. But I don't like you anymore. I don't like the man you have become. I am still the man you married. But you know as well as I do that in politics you have to give a little in order to gain a little from somewhere. - Really? - Yes, really! Aniti... tell that to the girl child, who will not be able to get the well-needed education to grow as a person, or understand, or better still, get out of the relationship she's been forced into. Can you please tell that to the girl child who is expected to perform, with a man, sexual acts the law forbids her to watch in movies? Tell that to the girl child who is being violated by the same people she expects to protect her, the same people who taught her to refrain from those acts she's been asked to perform. She just does not give a little. She gives everything! She gives it all! All right, so this involvement of yours, how is it going to change anything? I mean, these acts have been perpetrated by almost every tribe in the country. - Tell me! - I don't know! I do not know. But I can't sit around wondering if what I do is going to count for anything when I have not even made any attempt. You might be able to live with yourself. But I cannot go through this life knowing that I could've made a difference and yet did nothing. No matter how insignificant. If that makes me such a bad politician, I am sorry. But I am glad, also, that you have enough politics for the both of us. [upbeat music playing] [no audible dialogue] [no audible dialogue] [in Pidgin] We are begging. We are tired of this strike! - What is it? - Give me the microphone. Help us tell the government... - we are tired. - [Bosco] We are tired. Please help us ask them. Don't they have wives? Is this situation not in their own homes? We are tired! Our wives have refused to have sex with us. They should help us consider this issue properly. We are tired. My wife and I have quarreled so many times about this issue. Government, I beg you in the name of God, let's consider this issue very well. What these women are on about is not a bad thing. At all! At all! Let's leave our daughters to mature before giving them out in marriage. Giving an underage girl out in marriage is not a good thing. A little girl with no breasts? Give me. I want to tell them some truths. We need to speak up when we see the truth. We shouldn't be quiet because we are men. What is an older man doing with a little girl? Are there no women left? We are begging, please pity us. Being sex-starved is a bad thing. Sex starvation is a bastard! - Tell them, sex starvation is a bastard! - Sex starvation is a bastard! [in French] This women's protest, a sex strike organized by Nigerian women, is being talked about around the world. The movement is being supported by social media, print journalism, radio and television. And several women have even organized protests in solidarity - in London, New York, Los Angeles... - [chanting, indistinct] ...and even in Paris, Brussels, Rome and Madrid. We're seeing an international mobilization to defend the rights of women in Africa unlike anything seen before. It could be called a revolution. [no audible dialogue] [in English] Go outside. What is this? - [in Pidgin] Where did this come from? - Where did what come from? Is my English too advanced for you? I said, what is this? It's a sewing machine. Mama Ngozi and the other market women put some money together to buy me a sewing machine. - They just gave it to you today? - No. They gave me a while ago, but I kept it in the neighbor's house. I didn't know if you would get upset, so I kept it there. So, wait. So I got home unexpectedly to find out what everyone in the neighborhood already knew? Eh? So they've all been thinking I'm a useless man, right? No, Baba Amina. It hasn't come to that. I didn't want you to get upset the way you are now. That's why I kept it there. I meant to tell you after some time that they gave me the sewing machine. But this is good news. Why didn't you tell me? - You're not upset with me? - Why would I be upset? [laughs] Your friends, those women... They're real friends. They did well. They really did well. - So you're already sewing clothes? - Yes. This one is Amina's dress. This one was brought by a woman. She paid 350 naira. - You've started making money? - Yes. And I sewed this. - Mama Amina. - There's this outfit. Wait, turn... - Am I part of it? Are you sure? - There's this fabric I saw... Is the fabric expensive? It's not expensive. My husband is rich. It's just 4,000 naira. You can buy it. It's not expensive. - This is really good news, Mama Amina. - I know. They did well. Hey. [laughs] [in English] This has gone beyond my wife. She's not the issue at hand here. So in other words, he's not succeeding at getting her to keep quiet. I warned you there will be consequences. Take it easy, Pedro. There are ways out of this situation. What way out of this situation? This whole issue is going to blow up in my face. I beg your pardon, sir! If my wife had not encouraged those women, someone else would have come in and encouraged them. They were a walking time bomb waiting to explode. And from what I understand, the press were already involved before she got into it. Perhaps. But it wouldn't have been such a slap in our faces. Your wife's involvement makes us look like complete idiots. - Well, we've done a good job of that. - What did you just say? - You heard exactly what I said! - Gentlemen! And if you heard what I said, you'd have heard me say "we." Gentlemen, it hasn't come to this. Let us find a way out of this without resorting to blows. Sit. Both of you. [no audible dialogue] [female reporter] Men all over Nigeria are calling on the government to do something about the child bride law so their wives can call off the strike. The men say their productivity is being greatly affected as they cannot concentrate at work. Many road traffic accidents and machinery accidents at work are being reported as men all over the country experience severe sexual frustration. [in Pidgin] I thought Ngozi was supposed to come home today from boarding school. Uh-uh. I already told you she isn't coming. The midterm break is too short. There's no need. We'll pick her up when the term is over. It's a long journey from her school. Ah... Really? That means there will be enough room for both of us in this house. What is that? You know, you know... Today is Sunday. I want you to judge this issue with a "church mind." I beg you. I'm tired. I've tried and I'm tired. Don't think of it as giving me sex. Think of it as a welfare offering. [laughs] - Use God's mind. You're laughing at me. - Baba Ngozi, what's a "welfare offering"? Why are you bringing the church into this? What's it got to do with this? I'm tired. I can't hold myself together any longer. I'm tired. - I'm tired... - The truth is, even I am tired. You're a good woman! Who'd be married to a husband like yours and not be tired? I knew you'd be tired. I was just joking, I knew you'd get tired. Let's just go in and have a quickie! - I can't. - Nobody will know. Baba Ngozi, I can't. You think about it. I started this strike and I will end it. I can't betray all the Nigerian women like that. Wait, let me ask you a question. Okay. Let's assume the government refuses to do anything about this issue for up to a year, is this how my body will be? Is this how you want me to be? [sighs] [in English] I'm tired. When I got into politics, it was to change lives. I know it's a bit naive, but I honestly thought... I would make changes that would put a smile on people's faces. Over the years, I... I found myself compromising, little by little. Now, when I look in the mirror, I can't even recognize myself. No wonder my wife doesn't like me. Heck, I don't even like me. I look at myself and my skin crawls. Do you know that... many years ago, my wife and I had a child, a baby girl. Very beautiful. If that child had lived, the child would have been 13 last month. If any one of you had come, asking for my daughter's hand in marriage, I would have castrated you. If early marriage wouldn't have been good enough for my late daughter, then it is not good enough for any girl child. Enough is enough. I'm going to do what I should have done before I started to kill my conscience slowly. I resign. It's been a pleasure working with both of you gentlemen. How about, Senator Aniti, it doesn't come to that. Remember, this issue was never about the child bride. It was just to amend an existing law, of which they didn't get the majority of the House votes in order to achieve it. Of which we, in this party, contributed to most of the contrary votes. That is politics, Senator Isong. People will always disagree on issues. But if good men like you continue to bail out in the middle of the fight, how do we, as a nation, rise up above the situation that is threatening to tear us apart. I don't want to promise you that we will not disagree on issues. But people like you make me think twice on some decisions I would have made - if you were not in there. - So there's no way we can resolve this? Why can't we push for the Child Act to be adopted and enforced by the remaining states? Well, that may be a respite for now. A long-lasting solution? I doubt if there will ever be a real resolution. Well, I'm a trained lawyer. I can always go back to my law firm. And so are we, Senator Aniti. I suggest you think about it. But remember that your constituents didn't vote you in so that you could quit on them on any issue, but to help make a difference in their lives. Good day, gentlemen. I remember I have a meeting with the majority leader. And you all know how he doesn't like to be kept waiting. [grunts] [instrumental music playing] [no audible dialogue] [rock guitar theme plays] Men all over the country are jubilating as the government has now agreed to revisit the law concerning the section of the constitution of making the age 18 the age of consent regardless of marital status. The president has put his full weight on the governors of the states who have not yet implemented the Child Act law. Of course, we know that means that the women are very likely to call off the strike. [in Pidgin] So finally, it means... They said the president said he will put in his weight. They said women will call off... - We have won! - We have won! [cheering, laughing] Mama Ngozi! Let's call everyone! - I'll call Iya Bola. You call Christy. - I'll call Christy. Hey! Hello! Iya Bola's number is not going through. Christy's number has gone through. Christy, where are you? I knew it! You're always watching TV. Where are you? Oh, she's here! [Christy] Sisters, have you seen the news? [cheering] I saw the news. I said it. Wait, I have to... Where are you going? [in English] We have great news from Africa. The women of Nigeria who have been on strike have called off the strike. There had been a tug-of-war between the government and the women. We're glad to announce that the women have won the battle. This is a great win for women in Nigeria. But not only for the women in Nigeria, but for women everywhere. My name is Tim Careyway with the Action Room. From DNN News, thank you. [chattering, indistinct] [in Pidgin] Hey! Paulo, Bosco, Ade, have you heard? - What happened? - We have succeeded! We have succeeded. I just saw it on TV now. - Our women have succeeded. - [men exclaim] - Have they canceled the strike? - They have finally canceled the strike. - Yes! - Are you sure? What I saw with my eyes? The government should know they can't joke with us, the people! What did you do to proud of? Isn't it the women that fought? But we're part of it, Paulo. We talked on TV. See Calistus. That abused me. We fought the women but they refused, so we had to join in their fight. We protested! We gave up. When the sex starvation was too much, we joined the women to shout at the government. Now see the result! Paulo! I'm leaving you guys. I'm running to my wife. [indistinct chatter] - He wants to kill someone. - It's a mortuary! You guys are still here, right? Let me hurry home to my wife as well. I'm off to do something. Jemima! - [Jemima] Cali, I'm coming. - Please come quickly. [laughing] Finally! Please come quickly. Hey! Finally. Finally! Hey! My wife. [laughs] Jemima! Jemima! My wife. Come and sit down. - Please, I want to tell you something. - What? But you have to promise first that you won't be angry. I won't be angry! What could possibly make me upset now, when we've waited this long. [both laughing] Come and sit down here. Hey! Jemima! I decided to have a shower, so that I would be ready for you. That's how ready I am for you too. Cali, wait. Cali, let me finish my story. Be quick, now that the children are asleep. And so... As I finished having a shower, and was about to wipe myself off, I looked, and what did I see? What? - It was my time. - What time? I thought we should still continue as if the strike was still on. What time? What time are you talking about? Women's time of the month. Jemima, don't say it. Don't say this kind of thing again! Cali, it hurts me so much too. Can't you see that I was rushing to be ready. It hurts me too. So you will postpone that time. You will go back and wash up. Go and wash up. You must postpone this time, because whether you like it or not, it's me and you tonight. Jemima, wait! Come back here, Jemima! Hey. What is it? What's making you smile with all your teeth shining? I should laugh when I see my wife? I should laugh. That's good. Come, let me touch you a bit. You've started! You're strong! You're strong! Little you led all the women in Nigeria on strike, right? Respect. Respect! Respect. I respect you. My husband, you've started. - [cell phone rings] - Please go. Wait, my phone is ringing. Who is this person calling now? Hello? Who is this? My name is Emem Isong of Royal Art Academy. Royal Art, what? Royal Art Academy, the movie producers. - Oh! Emem Isong! - Yes. You're the one who produces all those beautiful movies. I would like to speak with Mama Ngozi. Am I speaking with her? I'm Mama Ngozi. - Yes, yes, yes. - Cool. Congratulations on what you are doing concerning the strike. It's really amazing. I'm really very proud of you people. I'm interested in buying the rights of this. I want to make a movie out of this. Is that possible? What? You want to buy the story? I'm going to offer you 1.5 million for the rights to make this into a movie. 1.5 million naira? That's good, that's good. Okay, I'll save your number. I have to talk to the other women. You know I'm not the only one involved in the whole thing. All right. All right, thank you so much. I'll get back to you. - Congratulations once again. - Thank you, thank you. Bye-bye. Hey! Hey!
