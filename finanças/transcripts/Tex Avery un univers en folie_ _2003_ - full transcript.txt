TEX AVERY: A CRAZY WORLD Welcome to Tex Avery's crazy world. Imagine a universe where everything becomes possible, especially the impossible. A world crowded with pin-ups and erotomaniac wolves, placid dogs and nutty squirrels, rabbits and ducks. This is Tex Avery's delirious universe and we invite you to discover it with us. Tex Avery was born on February 26, 1908 in Taylor, Texas. His real name is Frederick Bean Avery. He later used the nickname "Tex" because of Texas, of course. Among Tex Avery's ancestors are two legendary Far West characters: Daniel Boone, who looked like Davy Crockett with his beaver cap, and especially Judge Roy Bean who used to render hasty justice in his Vinegaroon saloon. It ran in the family! Even in his youth Tex Avery loved to draw. He spent nights working on a comic strip that was refused by everyone. Since he couldn't earn a living from cartoons, Avery started working for the cinema. "He was a hard worker," said Walter Lantz, producer of the "Oswald the Rabbit" series. "He was naturally talented and had a deep sense of humor. "He was a cruel joker. "Everyone created the gags, "but Tex was the best and funniest of all. "He soon became an excellent animator, "but that wasn't enough, he wanted to be a director." This period was marked by two events. A happy one: Avery's marriage to Patricia Johnson, who worked with Walter Lantz. And a tragic one: the loss of an eye. Avery and his pals often played practical jokes, and one of his co-workers accidentally sent a staple into his eye. To settle his money problems, Tex Avery left Walter Lantz to join the prestigious animation department at Warner Bros. headed by Leon Schlesinger. Back then most of the big Hollywood studios didn't have an animation department. They simply distributed cartoons produced by independent firms. But Walt Disney's success led some of them to turn to animation which had become very popular. At Warner Bros., Tex Avery became part of a talented team which included Chuck Jones, Bob Cannon, Fritz Freleng and Bob Clampett. They were a wild bunch and Leon Schlesinger isolated them in an area of the studio called "Termite Terrace". Bob Clampett said of the buildings: "The wood crunched "and you could pass your hand through the walls." Tex Avery worked for WB when the studio was at its utmost glory. Errol Flynn, James Cagney, Edward G. Robinson, Humphrey Bogart, Bette Davis, Paul Muni, Olivia de Havilland were the studio's stars. The directors were Michael Curtiz, Howard Hawks Mervyn LeRoy and William Dieterle. The movies were Captain Blood, The Story of Louis Pasteur, The Petrified Forest, Anthony Adverse, The Charge of the Light Brigade, A Midsummer Night's Dream. Tex Avery had to begin by choosing a regular character, a recurrent hero. This hero would be Porky Pig. He first appeared in Gold Diggers of '49 whose title obviously parodies the famous series of musicals choreographed by Busby Berkeley. Yet with Page Miss Glory, a few months later, Avery tried to get rid of conventions by creating an innovative graphic style inspired by art deco. This experiment remained unique since Avery never again used this style which he didn't seem to like anyway. At least, that's what he said. Throughout his career Avery would have fun playing with references. I Love to Singa is thus an allusion to Alan Crosland's Jazz Singer, the first talking picture made by Warner Bros. Apparently, at that time, Avery wanted to be called by his nickname "Tex", but Leon Schlesinger wanted to seem serious so Avery had to sign "Fred Avery" on the films he supervised for Warner. Though he made several cartoons featuring Porky Pig, Avery was not very interested in this nice yet rather silly pig who didn't allow him to use his creative craziness. Soon Avery would concentrate on a new character, Daffy Duck. In Porky's Duck Hunt he became Porky Pig's opponent. Avery seemed much more interested in Daffy Duck's tricks than in Porky Pig's dull behavior. Among the "Termite Terrace" team it was obvious that Avery was the most original and the most gifted. Avery's genius overturned the studio's traditions. A great example is Daffy Duck and Egghead which brings the viewer into the cartoon, creating a surprising new dimension. We thus see the character of the hunter shoot at a viewer who disturbs him. Avery was playing with three different levels. The first had to do with the viewer, the second with another viewer integrated into the cartoon and the third and last involved the cartoon's actual characters. This created an extraordinary analysis of parallel worlds. Tex Avery used this trick many times, incorporating the viewer into the story. In A Feud There Was a viewer shoots at the main character and says "goodnight" to the viewer of the film. In Cinderella Meets Fella, Cinderella is the one who enters the film. In Thugs with Dirty Mugs a viewer tells the police where to find the crook Ed G. Robensome, who of course looks like Edward G. Robinson. In Little Red Walking Hood, Little Red Riding Hood and the Wolf refuse to fight as long as the viewers haven't all quietly sit down. We think of Sherlock, Jr. with Buster Keaton and Woody Allen's The Purple Rose of Cairo which play with the relationship between viewers and what they see. Avery enjoyed twisting popular stories: Little Red Walking Hood features a surprising Little Red Riding Hood while Cinderella Meets Fella features a rather tipsy godmother. Avery's sense of humor grew even wilder. In A Day at the Zoo the visitor at the zoo and the baboon are strangely alike. In Screwball Football a lovely baby shoots a viewer who was ogling its ice cream. In Cross Country Detours a lizard does a striptease. One of the best gags of the film features a little girl frightening a monster when the opposite was to be expected. A great gag, worthy of Hellzapoppin! Leon Schlesinger was smart enough to give his directors a free hand, especially Tex Avery. According to Avery, he simply approved the good cartoons and asked his animators to make another one in the same style. Avery remembered that Schlesinger loved to play cards with his directors, while also trying to take a few dollars. Since making a cartoon is teamwork, we must mention two people who regularly worked with Avery and his group: Carl Stalling, who composed the music for the WB cartoons and Mel Blanc who was in charge of character voices. He thus lent his voice to Porky Pig, Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny who first appeared in A Wild Hare. Bugs Bunny, the most famous WB cartoon character, was a group creation. Tex Avery was the first to admit that he owed a lot to Walt Disney. He told historian Joe Adamson: "I think what you do with a character "matters more than the character itself. "Bugs Bunny could have been a bird. "What matters is not what is seen on screen, "but how the character talks and acts. "The details define "its personality." Bugs Bunny has a lot in common with Max Hare from The Tortoise and the Hare, one of Disney's "Silly Symphonies". Michael Maltese, one of Avery's co-workers, declared to the magazine Film Comment: "Avery gave Bugs Bunny the personality "that made him Bugs Bunny." Tex Avery added: "Those who have seen A Wild Hare "will see that the rabbit's personality has not "changed much. "He was less friendly, but we worked on him until he became very nice." Bugs Bunny' famous expression "What's up, Doc?" comes from Texas and it was surely Tex Avery's idea to attribute it to the rabbit in remembrance of his youth and the expressions of his native Texas. The carrot, an essential Bugs Bunny accessory, has a more uncertain origin. Some say it's a reference to Groucho Marx's famous cigar. Others say the idea comes from New York-Miami by Frank Capra in which Clark Gable eats a carrot. Tex Avery directed several Bugs Bunny cartoons and continued to make even crazier cartoons. Hollywood Steps Out parodies famous Hollywood stars: Johnny Weissmuller, Cary Grant, Greta Garbo, Edward G. Robinson, James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, George Raft. He not only caricatures the actors, but also manages to find an idea, a joke or a detail that personalizes them for the audience. In Holiday Highlights, Avery evocates the year's main events and, between two gags, he showed deep bitterness in describing a new graduate who is congratulated by the university dean before getting into an unemployment line. Avery's genius was boundless. Aviation Vacation, which imitates a documentary, shows an Irish singer performing one of his favorite songs. A hair appears on the screen like a speck of dust on the lens of the film projector. The singer grows more and more irritated until a hand takes off the hair. Eleven years later, in Magical Maestro, Tex Avery would use this gag to once again create a surprising dimension between viewers and what they see on screen. After that, he made his last Porky Pig cartoon: Porky's Preview. Avery had lost all interest in the fat pig from his early WB days. He turned the cartoon into a series of graphical sketches with hardly any gags, an amazing and unique experiment in Avery's career. In spite of Avery's exceptional talent and even in spite of the trust Leon Schlesinger showed him, the relationship between the two men deteriorated. Tex Avery left Warner Bros. to join Paramount. There, he worked on a show called Speaking of Animals. The cartoons Avery started were released after his departure. Things were definitely over between Warner Bros. and Tex Avery. One of Avery's last cartoons for WB is about a canary who is harassed by a big black cat who wants to eat him. This cartoon prefigures some of the future WB cartoons. After 7 years, Avery's style had become stunning. Avery said: "I discovered "that the eye can register an action in 5 or 6 images. "With 24 images per second, "it takes about 1/5 of a second to register an action "from the screen through the eye and to the brain. "I found out that if you want something to be barely seen, "5 images are enough. "2 or 3 seconds would ruin it." Tex Avery learned his trade at WB, but would make his greatest cartoons at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At MGM he was immediately able to use his nickname "Tex". Avery was thus at MGM when the USA entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor. MGM was still the studio that had, according to its slogan, "more stars than you can see in the sky". Greta Garbo, Judy Garland, Clark Gable, Lana Turner, Spencer Tracy, Robert Taylor and dozens of prestigious stars worked for the "lion company". They made innumerable movies which were all just as successful. George Cukor's Two-Faced Woman, Ziegfield Girl, Billy the Kid, featuring Robert Taylor. Like Warner Bros., MGM now had its own animation department, headed by Fred Quimby, who had previously worked in business. Tex Avery said of him: "He knew nothing about stories or gags or anything." Fred Quimby, who indeed deserves to be acknowledged, was at least smart enough to let Tex Avery do what he wanted, even as the studio was developing with W. Hanna and J. Barbera the famous "Tom and Jerry" series which Quimby was also producing. From the outset, Avery showed genius, notably in Blitz Wolf, featuring a wolf who looks like Hitler. Supported by a great animation team, Avery boosted MGM's cartoons. "Tex's arrival was like an avalanche", commented Michael Lah, one of the directors. The wolf in Blitz Wolf would later become, without resembling Hitler, a recurrent character in Avery's cartoons. He would face two of Avery's most unforgettable creations, Droopy and the pin-up girl. During Avery's years at MGM, the wolf would change. The vindictive wolf in Blitz Wolf or Northwest Hounded Police would become a good-natured wolf nicknamed "The Texan Wolf', an eternal victim. This evolution can be seen in Billy Boy and Three Little Pups, although later on, in Homesteader Droopy, his virulence reappears. Droopy, the placid, often sententious dog, would star in many Tex Avery cartoons. He became so famous that MGM, even after Tex Avery's departure, used him again in other cartoons and in a TV series. Droopy himself evolved along with the style of the MGM cartoons. There is a big difference between the early Droopy who appeared in Dumb Hounded and Northwest Hounded Police, and the one in Deputy Droopy or Dixieland Droopy. As for the pin-up girl from Red Hot Riding Hood, we will see her again in several cartoons such as The Shooting of Dan McGoo, Swing Shift Cinderella, and Wild and Woolfy. Right away, Tex Avery's cartoons were extraordinarily successful. Audiences were so enthusiastic that theaters programming Blitz Wolf had to show the cartoon twice each time. Moviegoers loved the pin-up girl whose appearance triggered laughter and applause. It is said that the GI's were as excited as the wolf by the sexy pin-up girl, beautifully animated by Preston Blair, one of the most gifted sketchers on Tex's team. A couple of months after the gorgeous vamp, the mad squirrel appeared, probably Tex Avery's craziest and most original creation. A perfect example of Tex Avery's originality is found in Screwball Squirrel which stars the mad squirrel. The scenery is very "Disney", but when the mad squirrel appears it is obvious that nothing will ever be the same again and that we have entered Tex Avery's universe. Squirrels are traditionally thought of as cute little animals. But contrary to custom, this one is a cruel, vindictive, ruthless animal who tortures Meatball the dog. Tex Avery did the voice of the poor dog who cannot escape from the squirrel's persecution. In Tex Avery's world, everything is possible. Characters grow bigger or shrink, are blown to pieces and then reconstituted. Avery often enjoyed illustrating well-known expressions. The wolf in The Shooting of Dan McGoo literally has "one foot in the grave". Symphony in Slang is a continuous surprise. Using slang expressions, this cartoon illustrates the confession of a man up in heaven who describes his life to people who then try to picture it. This leads to a series of very peculiar interpretations. Avery's perfectionism shows even in the sketches he prepared with his collaborators. Every meticulously-drawn detail was transferred to the celluloids made from these sketches and then used in the final animated film. We marvel at the expressiveness of the characters and at the gags already latent in these sketches. Here we see the different phases of Avery's work: a storyboard roughly outlining the story, drawings illustrating every action in this story - with each drawing representing 1/24 of a second - and then the final celluloid. At the same time, the sketchers were given a "model sheet" with precise instructions regarding the shapes, sizes and expressions of the characters they would be drawing. From King Size Canary, featuring the fight between a canary, a rat, a cat and a dog, to Cock-a-Doodle Dog, which pits an exhausted dog against a bothersome rooster, Avery's genius and sense of humor are devastating. "l tried to do everything myself," admitted Tex Avery who would return to his office at night or during the week end to perfect a new character's expression or think up new gags. Thanks to Avery, to his omnipresence, his team would produce masterpieces and their cartoons would be genuinely crazy. This transpired through their outstanding use of gags, the genuine work they did on references and puns, their excellent use of sounds and noises, and Scott Bradley's musical direction, switching from one tune to another, from a melody to an opera. And with all of this, never giving the mesmerized viewer a moment's rest. Unfortunately, right when Avery and his collaborators were doing their highest quality work, MGM, along with the other big Hollywood studios, was faced with 2 major problems: competition from television and the dismantling of the old vertical monopoly: production-distribution-exhibition. MGM was facing a crisis. Cartoons were adopting a new, fashionable style that simplified the settings, the characters and the animation. With the continuing crisis, MGM had to close its animation dept. W. Hanna and J. Barbera, Tom and Jerry's creators, went into television. They successfully produced many TV series, but they never forgot Tex Avery and gave him work on many occasions. Tex Avery also left MGM. He would direct 4 cartoons for his former boss Walter Lantz. After that, he worked on TV commercials for which he revived the Bugs Bunny character. Tex Avery died on August 26, 1980. He had brought a dimension that was lacking to the world of cartoons: that of the craziest and greatest imagination.
