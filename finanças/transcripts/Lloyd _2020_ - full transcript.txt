[Music] [Music and noise of helicopter propellers] [Music] [bipping] - It's all right now. Relax, relax. Breathe - I'm sorry - No need - Walter wouldn't let me leave any earlier - They stopped all that nonsense out there yet? -No, not yet. - Well, they need to. We already don't have enough nurses or doctors working. You and the other interns are still not enough to make up for the gaps in shifts. Pass me my blazer, please. Damn strike! You know they had the nerve to block... What happened to your face? - Hmm... - Overgrown tree branches. - You look just like her when you lie. Get to work then. Miss Clayton is being transferred at six, so she'll need a bath - Anthony, don't you walk away from me Anthony... please! You're being reckless again. - Go ahead and forget about it, dad. And I might wanna have a conversation with our little worker boy over there because he is pushing for it. - You get one more, one and then you're out of here. Anthony!! - You're okay? - Yeah. - I really can't stand that guy. - I'm so tired of this fucking town. - You have one more chance, Lloyd. One more chance. Yeah. - No. His breath stinks like... really, really bad. - I can imagine Well, I have an awesome rehearsal today - Hm, hmm... Well, with everybody - Wow... - I expect nothing less - Feels good to be in bed - Thanks for staying over. - Yeah, of course My dad likes you... so... I guess I do too [Music] - You told me this wouldn't happen again, Lloyd. You promised me this wouldn't happen again. You know, Sylvia wanted to keep you from all of this she wanted to keep you from all the constant non-stop fighting in this damn town. She was trying to protect you. Look at you now... I'm not done - She was so restless. You're always fighting for something or some cause, spent your lives together and you never really knew her. I've never done anything to Anthony He and everyone else in this town hate me for some fucked up reason and I wish you would see that. [Music] - You're okay? - Fine. - How was the meeting? - Oh, it went great! No! It was awful. Johnson just doesn't get it and Anthony's the worst and he came in at the end of the meeting. I swear they planned it. - Look, I told you... if anything goes down, I'll be there. - It doesn't even matter, all right? You want to know why? It's because in a year, we're gonna be on the road together, you and me. You playing shows, me managing your career. - Hmm...that's cute but you need to be in school. - Look, I don't need college. All right? I'd be much better off being your manager than... figuring out the heart's temper mentality or whatever - You being my manager? You'd be way too abrasive- - Hell, yeah I'd be abrasive In fact give me my 60% cut right now, nigger. - 60%, really? - Yeah - Do you know what it feels like to have mace in your eyes ? It's as if having little needles scraping back and forth across your cornea, back and forth. That's what it felt like when I got caught up in that stupid blockade trying to avoid that fucking fire Your bitch of a mother started all this shit and it appears she forgot to take it with her when her poor little heart gave out. You wanna know what I'm gonna do, do you? I'm gonna peel you like an orange Then I'll leave you in pieces and parts all over that nigga's house who've been taunting the cops and and dragging this bullshit strikeout. Sylvia is dead, her son dead. One by nature and the other by my nurturing hands. A forceful warning for Do you make me insane? Look at that. You found us [Music] - Let's go [Music] [Phone ringing] - Hello Well, clearly you are not trying hard enough. why don't you do your goddamn job and find them? - What happened Morris? Why are you calling...? - Who's this? - Well, looks like your nephew's in more trouble -Ma-am... - The whole damn town's on fire. We don't have time for this - There's a student that's missing a few days now. I mean, we just need your husband... - He's my brother. Morris, what is this about? What does Lloyd have to do with all of this? - Look, I say stay out of trouble and he does the exact opposite. - We were told that this student, Anthony Trudeau, has been in particular contention with Lloyd and we just need... - Lloyd? I need a moment. - Ma'am, I don't think you understand. - Forgive me, mister. I think I fully understand what it is you're implying Excuse me.
