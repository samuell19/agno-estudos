That's the only way to treat a pussy. Now, you just shut up and do what you're told. Maybe I changed my mind. [grunting] We made a deal. [screaming] Bitch! You're hurting me! Ow! Hey, can one of you spare a little change? Stop it! Stop it-t! [continues screaming] Hey, what the hell are you doing? [continues screaming] Help! Somebody help! Help! Hel-- [dramatic music] [grunting] [saxophone music] Well, she'd gone out to buy some groceries and...she was carrying our little baby on her back in one of those, you know, those papoose...things. She come out of the market with the groceries in her arms and was walking down the street and these two guys had just robbed a liquor store and were running away. She just happened to be in their path and...one of them rammed right into her and sent her and.. ...our baby flying through... a plate glass window. By the time they got 'em to the hospital, they.. [sighs] ...just lost too much blood. Jesus Christ. [chuckling] Seems like yesterday. It was ten years ago. Ten years ago...today. What the hell is it about a bartender that makes people tell 'em stuff they wouldn't tell anybody else, huh? Have one on me, Jake. Yeah, okay. Thanks. Cheers. [dramatic music] [grunting] [people screaming] Call a paramedic. [screaming] Be careful, Jake. [screaming] [cat purring] [dramatic music] [breathing heavily] That bitch! Stinking whore! You fucker! [indistinct shouting] Osborne, homicide. I got a cold one in the alley there. No can do. This one may not make it. Okay, I'll call the coroner. Ha, what the hell happened to this guy, anyway? - A cat get his tongue? - Oh, that's funny. Very funny. - Are you sure this is alright? - I do this all the time. Now, let's see that big gun of yours. - Okay, we're gonna do it here? - You want the Hilton? It will feel great. Now, gimme the money. - What first? - Always first. Come on.. - You sure this is safe? - I do this all the time. It's safe as hell. [tires screeching] Damn it! I knew it. I knew it. Is that your pimp? [tires screeching] Relax. Come on, kid. Get in the car. Get in the car. - Hey. - You don't need to do that. Jake, don't hit-- Jake, what did you that for? Grab your stuff and get in the car. Move it! Now! Hey, what about my money? Don't you get it, bonehead? I'm a cop! Now, take a hike before I bust your ass. [engine revving] [tires screeching] What the hell is this all about, Jake? - Murder. - Murder? A girl was killed a little while ago in the alley behind the topless joint. What kinda girl? A working girl. Like you. Oh. You mean a nice, refined, well-educated girl like me? - Yeah. - She was a hooker? Like you. You're putting me off. You're trying to scare me off the streets. I'm telling you, a girl got her throat cut from ear to ear 'and she was a working girl.' 'That's what I'm telling you.' You got any trouble on the streets lately? - Seen anybody weird? - Are you kidding? I always see somebody weird. I mean, really weird. No. Anybody tried to get rough with you or hurt you in anyway? - No. - Let me take you home. No, you can't do that. Just drop me off. - Where? - The next corner. [woman screaming] What the hell does that guy think he's doing? Forget it. They fight like that every night. 'Same phone booth.' [screaming continues] - Thanks for the ride, Jake. - 'Okay.' If you see anything or hear anything, you let me know. I'm usually at this bar. Looks like somebody pissed on this card. Somebody probably did. I found it on the floor. Jake, how come you're so nice to us girls? Well, Tina.. Kafka said, "We are sinful not merely because we have tasted "of the Tree of Life, but also because we have not yet eaten of the Tree of Knowledge." Or was it the other way around? Who's Kafka? My dentist. - Night, Jake. - Night, Tina. [pleasant music] [telephone ringing] - Hello? - 'Mother.' You idiot! I've told you never to call me here. This is me. This is your son. So, what the hell else is new? - I gotta talk to you. - Not now. 'Please, mother.' Can't you get it through your head? You are never to call me at this number. I did something ba-a-ad. I don't give a shit if you did something good. - Please, mother. - Look, stupid. You were a bad kid and you're a bad man. I was not a...a bad kid. Oh, shut up! I ought to know. I raised you. You never paid any attention to me. Well, who the hell would want to? You're just a jerk! Now, you just leave me alone! And don't you ever call me here again! Please, mother.. And don't you call me mother! [phone ringing] Yes? Why, of course you can come over Mr. Waltham. Our...pleasure. Bye. [dramatic music] You never paid any attention to me. You never paid and attention to me. Never! Hello, ma. Never! You never paid any attention to me. You fuckin' whore! You fuckin' cunt! [screaming] I was not a bad...kid! I was not a bad...kid! I was not a bad kid! [music continues] [crying] I was not a bad kid. I was...I was not a bad kid. [mumbling] I was not a bad kid. [crying] I was not a bad kid. [squeaking] [panting] I don't wanna be a bad man. [car approaching] Looking for a date, honey? Yeah, I'm looking for some action. - You got money? - Yeah, I got money. Sure. Right here. Next to my heart. - Got me? - Hey, man, watch your tongue. No, it's your tongue that I wanna watch. I don't think I need your kind of money. Get in the car, you cheap slut. Hey, man, screw you! [screaming] Fuckin' whores. Oh, my God! [screaming continues] Carla, listen to me. The wino didn't make it. You're all we've got. So I need you to look real hard here now, okay? [Carla] 'Like I said, it was dark and it happened so fast.' - How's your finger? - They sewed it back on. It's there. But the doctor said it's probably useless as a finger. It's just there. - Well, could've been worse. - Yeah, could've been my head. That's right. You could've been the girl in the alley. I knew her. Her name was Scarlett. - Did she have a last name? - Hm, Coleman. - You knew her well? - Nah, not really. Well, it wasn't any of them. 'I don't even know if I'd recognize him.' But it ain't one of them. Well, I'll move the guys out. Well, that's it. Carla...you need rest. Why don't you stay off the streets for a while, huh? What are you? Some kind of comedian? [chuckles] Okay. [crickets chirping] [slow music] [both chuckling] How long are we gonna fool around like this? Oh, Johnny, I thought you'd like to dance. [Johnny] Hmm. Don't do that. There's a time and a place for everything. That's what I was thinking. Where's the bedroom, hm? [chuckling] That's what I like about you, Johnny. You're so subtle. Subtle, I am not. That is a part of my charm, right? Come on. - Help me. - Okay. [intense music] [music continues] [gasps] [moans] [gasps] [breathing heavily] Oh, yes, Johnny. Oh, yes. Take me. Oh, yes. Take me, Johnny. Take me. [panting] Oh, yes. [woman mumbling] [intense music] [Johnny kissing] [moans] [woman moaning] [woman] Oh.. [beeping] It's the garage door. You told me he'd be out all night. Well, he's supposed to be. He never comes home before dawn on his poker nights. Oh, God, Johnny.. - I'm so scared. - Oh, yeah, you're scared. I'm dead meat if he catches me. - Go out the service entrance. - Shh! - Where did you park? - Up the street, in front. See you, baby. [door opens] [screaming] What the hell? [gun firing] [gurgling] [tires screeching] [gun firing] [female #1] It's Murphy. I've got him. [police siren wailing] [car engine revving] [siren continues] [upbeat rock music] [siren continues] [police siren wailing] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [car engine revving] [tires screeching] [siren continues] [gun firing] [gun firing] [police siren wailing] [gun fires] [siren continues] [tires screeching] [giggling] - Hi! - Oh, man! [grunts] [grunting] Fuck you! Alright, bitch cop. Now you're gonna die! Freeze! [gun fires] Thanks, Jake. [police siren wailing] Pig jerks! A-ah! Oh, man.. Motherfucker, I'm bleeding! Lighten up, pig! So is my heart, citizens. Your mother sucks! [grunting] - You can't do this, man! - Do what? I didn't do anything. Why don't we just book him? You drive, I'll pick up my car later. I hate pigs, man. I hate fuckin' pigs! This asshole's going for ADW on a PO. - Right, sarge. - Fuckin' pig, watch my arm! How can I ever thank you enough? [exhales] Well...my back's been acting up again. Maybe you could, uh.. [groaning] [Jake] 'Oh, that feels gre-e-at..' Ooh, that's what you always say, Jake. [groaning] You are such a nut. [saxophone music] I love you anyway. [Jake] Oh, God.. Magic touch.. [music continues] [moaning] Are you enough to do me a little? [groaning] - Now? - Yeah! Well...if you insist. [chuckling] I do. [Jake groaning] [music continues] [telephone ringing] [groans] [ringing continues] Oh.. Oh.. Brenda Murphy. How soon can you get to Tony Fontana's place in Hollywood Hills? Uh, half an hour? Well, skip the make-up. Chief wants you there pronto. Oh, uh, you wouldn't happen to know where your partner is now, would you? What's happened? Seems our friend Tony just bought the farm. Tell Jake I said hi. [clicks tongue] Tony Fontana's been killed. It's our case. Jake? Jake? - Okay. - Come on, it's our case. That is, if I can find you. Where are you anyway? Look, you better call in while I hop in the shower. - 'What time is it?' - It's time to get up. [instrumental music] Hello, doll. [chuckles] What you readin'? "The Curse of the Vampire." Sounds interesting. - Is it any good? - Well, it's kind of scary. I mean, if you really wanna know the truth. If you wanna know the truth, I just wanna fuck. - Oh, okay. - Bitch! - Call me a bitch? - Hey, fuck you! [screams] [screaming] - No! No! - Come back! - Come here! Come here. - No! No! Hey, you fuckin' whore! [screaming] [car engine revving] [female reporter] Bloody murder, gangland style. The slaying of Tony Fontana, well-known to local authorities. Reporting live from the Hollywood Hills. 'Now back to you, Jim.' It was bound to happen. I-I had these feelings. But I...I prayed they wouldn't come true. 'All these years, it's been like, um, living outside a cage' watching the animals tear each other apart. Do you have any idea who might have done this? It wasn't hard to convince myself that Tony wasn't one of the animals. I loved him. I know it's a terrible time for you, Mrs. Fontana. But can you think of anyone who may have wanted Tony dead? Poor Tony. He thought he was safe from them. When you heard the shots, where were you? I was in my room, waiting. I think I'd like to go in now. Uh, e-excuse me, one minute. We do need the answer to one question. Do you have any idea who might have done this? Hm? No. [sobbing] [Gavin] 'We're all through, Jake.' What did you find? Not a thing. Just a lot of local prints. Did you identify the weapon? You saw the body, toots, what do you think? - Uzi. - Bingo! Another killer gone straight to hell. That's about it. See ya later. [sighs] You gotta cool it in front of those guys. You know, we're not supposed to make judgments. Give me a break. Don't be so naive, Jake! 'We know how many lives have been lost' due to that son of a bitch! I don't care what kind of performance that bereaved widow gave. That bastard went straight to hell! Let's get out of here. I'll buy you a drink downtown, come on. I'm a liberated broad and don't you forget it. - How can I forget it? - 'Sarge.' This guy says he saw a man leaving the house. His name is Manuel Lopez. He lives across the street over the garage. - 'He's a gardener.' - What did you see exactly? I see this guy walking down from the house to his car. Did you get a good look at him? I think so. He walked right under the street light. You think you'd recognize him from a picture? I think so. Well, good, we'll get you right downtown. You look at some mug shots for us, okay? How about her taking me? Forget it, man, she's not part of the deal. Oh, come on, senor, I like to look, man. It's in my blood. Yeah, I can dig it, man. It's in mine, too. Come on. - Hey, bye-bye, beautiful. - Smooth, ain't he? Manuel, we gotta work on your delivery. He's dead, Carlos. Tony's been murdered. Oh, you're surprised? Well, I hope you had nothing to do with it. [chuckling] What? Really pissed me off, the way that guy, Manuel was looking at you tonight. You don't want men to stare at me you shouldn't take me out in public. Give me a sip. Eww...that's scotch. [Brenda] 'Ho-ho.' Yeah. Kinda like you. Oh, yeah? How long did it take you to realize you couldn't live without me? That hasn't happened yet. Oh? How come? 'Cause I haven't figured out what I'm gonna get out of this in the end. [moaning] [Brenda] Why don't we try to find out? [saxophone music] [music continues] [telephone ringing] Jake. The phone. Answer it. [Jake] Not my house. What'll people think? [telephone ringing] Sh-h! Oh.. Murphy speaking. Yeah, Brenda, Collins. [chuckles] Sorry about that, sarge. I just got here myself. The boys down here told me that the witness they just brought in is able to identify the man leaving the Fontana house. They've got an identification. Yeah, the witness picked out a mugshot of Johnny Malone. He thinks Johnny's the one. Johnny Malone? Thanks, Collins. Look, I'll get in touch with Osbourne and I'll be right down. Johnny Malone? God, it's taken a long time to nail that scumbag. Let's go get him. Come on.

[music continues] [music continues] [music continues] Don't you know smoking is bad for your health? What the hell's going on? Tony Fontana is dead and we've got someone who put you in the picture. Oh, you ain't got shit. Tony and I were buddies. Look, Johnny, I don't want to hurt you, okay? [grunting] Ah! [grunting] [groaning] - Satisfied? - You bet your ass I am. [Jake] 'Where were you last night?' With a lady. A lady? You? Hah! Oh, stuff it, asshole. - So what was her name? - Candy Johnson. - The actress? - Yeah. Yeah, I bet you'd like a piece of that action, huh? [chuckles] Thought she had a little class. What the hell's she doing with a jerk-off like you? Ask her. So were you with her allnight? Yeah. Yeah, well, we'll just see about that. Right now, you're going downtown, Johnny boy. Get up! 'We found the body of another hooker.' [Brenda] 'The same MO?' Yeah. Poor kid was almost cut in half. And we don't have a clue. Not one. Maybe we should put this Tony Fontana case on the back burner and go after this creep full-time. No, I don't think so. We'd just be spinning our wheels on that. Atleast with Fontana, we've got some kind of a direction. This is, uh, Candy Johnson's agent. His name is, uh, Ralph Conners. See if he knows anything about her connection with Johnny. I'm gonna check with Candy. Oh, I get it. You get to interview the actress and I'm stuck with good old Ralph. Works out better that way. Hey, you better watch your step with that little scream queen. I think I can handle it. That's what I'm afraid of. [Jake chuckling] May I help you, sir? Yeah, I, uh, have an appointment with Candy Johnson. She's working on the set right now. - And where is that? - Right through that door. Thanks. If things don't work out with Candy, I get off at 5:00. Alright, I'll keep that in mind. I hope I see you later. Thanks. [growling] [continues growling] Cut! Cut! What the hell are you doing? - You're in the shot. - I'm sorry. Get out of the shot. I didn't realize you were shooting. I'm sorry. I'm looking for Candy Johnson. She's in make-up. Around the set. Thanks a lot. I do apologize, sorry. Excuse me. I thought you were on the bell. This is a closed set. Hello, Jake. Hi, Candy. - What take is it? - Take three. Three? I never did three takes in my whole life. And now I've got to worry about the budget. Lock that damn door. Okay, let's shoot it. Slime him up. Bring in the smoke. More wind. More slime. Roll on. 'Roll on.' Speak. Action. [growling] [screaming] Time has been good to you. [laughing] Not half so good as it's been to you. You haven't changed at all. Still gorgeous. When you called this morning.. ...just hearing your voice again I must have sounded nervous as hell. I didn't notice. Well, sit down. Tell me what this is all about. Maybe I just wanted to see you again. I wish. Okay...tell me, how long have you known Johnny Malone? Why? Don't answer a question with a question. That's not polite. Johnny and I are friends. - How long? - A long time. - When did you see him last? - The night before last. We had dinner at my apartment. - Did you go out anywhere? - No, we stayed in all evening. We watched a couple of video tapes he brought over. - What time did he leave? - About midnight. Is that all, Jake? I really have to get back to my make-up. [chuckles] Yeah...I guess that's it. Jake, can I see you sometime? When it's not so official. Sure. - I'll walk you to the door. - Oh, one more thing. I almost forgot. Hm...did you ever meet Tony Fontana. Yeah, Johnny worked for Tony I think. We went to the fights in Vegas a couple of times as Tony's guests. It's too bad about his murder. Yeah. Did his wife come along? No, Tony said she couldn't stand the sight of blood. He ever bring anybody else with him? - You mean another woman? - I mean, anybody. He was with a different young girl each time. Hm, you think maybe his wife found out? I couldn't say. Johnny would've never told her. Candy.. Thanks for seeing me. I'll be in touch. Please don't make it too long, Jake. [soft rock music] [typewriter clacking] - So, what did you find out? - Nothing. Ralph Connors won't be in his office until six this evening. So how's Miss Blue Eyes? I think she's a liar. But I did find out one thing. Tony played around a lot. Oh, really? Of course, she could've been making that up too. But I don't know why, I don't like anything about this case. Johnny has to be the killer. I don't know. Whoever it was, had to know Tony's habits. - Johnny's the one. - Maybe. I'm gonna go over to Tony's place. Play a little game. If I tell Marissa.. ...that Johnny is trying to throw the killing off on her I might be able to rattle her a little bit. Make her...make some kind of a move. You don't think Marissa killed him, do you? I don't know. Hello, this is Brenda Murphy. Yes, I know that you told me Mr. Connors wouldn't be back until six, but this is quite urgent. I'm a friend of Candy Johnson's. - Right, I've got it. Thanks. - 'No!' Get up! - Sit down, sit down! - Damn you hurt me. Brenda, Brenda this is a bum rap. What's the problem, Fred? The problem is this broad has embarrassed me for the last time. She doesn't have the brains to be an idiot. No, I was waiting at the bus stop. When this creep strong arms me into the car. I should have yelled rape. Hey, wait a minute. Fred's a fair guy. - I-- - This just isn't right. Every hooker on my beat knows enough to get off the street when they see me cruising. - Look! - But not Einstein here. I ain't no hooker. I happen to be an entertainer. I happen to do exotic dancing. Bullshit, Wanda. Hey, earth to Wanda, You're a hustler. You were born a hustler and you're gonna die a hustler. You let this guy talk this way to me? You're a fuckin' creep. 'You really hurt me, you know that?' Also she's gone blind. She gets off the curb while I'm waiting for the line she throws me a pitch. Did you do that, Wanda? Did you proposition Detective Gavin? Well, yeah. But you knew how I'm going blind. 'And then this other night this creep attacked me' 'and broke my glasses.' What do you mean attacked you? Yeah, I mean, I was standing on the street corner reading my book, when all of a sudden this creep drives up. And it's like he starts talking dirty to me. And, well, you know, I tell him to buzz off. And then he started getting out this knife and he went.. ...ah-ah-ah. I had to jump right outta my high heels to get away. I mean, this guy was a total creep. I mean he was really mean. Hey, look, sit down at my desk, okay? And relax. And I'll be right with you. What're you trying to prove, Fred? Don't gimme a hard time, sarge. I'm putting her in the slammer. - My minds made up. - Look! Wanda is very valuable to me. I need her on the streets. Where the hell are my gummy bears? Besides, what about her possible ID of the killer? Well, yeah, that, uh, that would be a hell of a bust. Hm. You'll be a hero. Yeah? No, no, look, how am I gonna get out of this without looking like an idiot? Look, Wanda doesn't have too much upstairs, right? No shit, Sherlock. So, look, I'll go over there and talk to her for a couple of minutes and you stroll by and tell her that because of her special assistance that you're going to give her a second chance. - How about it, Fred? - Okay, okay, just for you, huh? But I want to be in on the collar. It's a deal. Now gimme the key. Hey, you owe me one. - God! I love that dress. - Oh! Okay, gimme your hands. Raise 'em up a little...there. Do you know, my hands were turning white? Hey, sarge, I didn't know you wear glasses. Yeah, I wear 'em when sometimes when I'm driving they relax my eyes. You know these look just like mine. You can borrow 'em if you want. Yeah? Oh, thanks! [dramatic music] [chuckling] What's the matter? Sarge, who's that guy talking to Detective Gavin? Well, that's Detective Collins. He's from the Rampart division. That is the guy that attacked me and broke my glasses. [indistinct] - Are you sure it's him? - 'Yeah, really positive.' We've got to get you some place safe. - Out of this jail. - I'm really scared. I don't want you to utter a word of this to a single soul. Now, come on. I'm so glad I was able to reach you in the car before you went to Fontana's. - What did you do with Wanda? - She's at my place. Jesus, Collins! I can't believe that! Are you sure you can trust Wanda's identification? She's one of the best snitches I have. She's never made a mistake before. We've gotta catch him in the act. Some kind of a sting. Identification by a half blind hooker, ain't gonna make it. So what's our next move? Well, we can't stop our normal investigations. That'd be a dead give away. Do you still want me to interview Candy's agent? Yeah. I'll go talk to Marissa. I'll meet you back downtown in about two hours. We'll get hold of Fred and we'll make some plans. Be careful. You're the one better watch your step. You know these Hollywood agents. They'll either sign you or screw you. Maybe both. [male #1] 'Look, the guy's a lousy director.' 'He keeps working with this bogus crew.' 'He's late for every location.' None of my clients want to work with him, alright? Sally, send the girl in, would you? 'Hello.' I'm Brenda Murphy. Do me a favor, would you? Would turn around for a second? Why? I just wanna kind of look at you from every angle. Okay. Why, you are something else. So I guess you wanna get into show business just like your friend Candy, huh? No, not really. You see.. You don't have to be bashful with me. Well, I'm not being bashful. You might say that I'm-I'm just trying to as a matter of fact, I-- As a matter of fact, you wanna be a star. Do you think I have anything to offer? Well, I think you're fantastic. You know, there is a part there's a part that's just absolutely perfect for you. 'It's right down your alley. It's you, it's you-it's..' Uh, but, there is a...there's one scene in there where the girl has to.. She does one little nude scene. I've gotta, I've gotta know what I'm representing here. Do me a favor. Would you take off your blouse for a second? 'And I'll take my jacket off.' 'The air conditioning is on the fritz.' Well.. You know, you're just exactly what they're looking for. Why don't you take your blouse all the way off? 'I wanna see more of you.' - Candy Johnson. - Candy? Oh, let's see, but.. Six years ago, she ran, uh, she ran off to Mexico. With a guy that was dealing drugs. 'She told me they got married down there' but, five months later she had a kid. - Who is the father? - Gee, I don't know. But you know, just before she left she was going really hot and heavy. For a long time with a cop. I'll bet you it was his kid. Yeah? And what about the child? I don't know. She never told me what happened. 'What about the cop?' 'Oh, she never told me that either.' Fun's over Ralphy. Sergeant Murphy. LAPD. I can't believe you're a lady cop. You mean, you've got a uniform and everything? Handcuffs? That would be really hot. Now, look, your girl Candy, she's involved in a killing. - Candy? - 'Yeah.' Involved in a murder? Nah. I don't believe it. You're a smooth operator, Ralphy. I bet you're lucky with all the girls. Yeah, well, I try. Goodbye. [birds chirping] [piano music] I thought we said our goodbyes, Jake. - So did I. - So? Well, uh...complications. Don't riddle me, Jake. - I hate riddles. - Okay. Was Johnny Malone, a friend of Tony's? Oh, that creep. No. We go back a long way. We've known each other a long time too, Jake. Yeah. You just can't forget what I was, can you? I was a call girl. A high class hooker, right? And guess who my pimp was? Young Johnny Malone. Young kid just breaking into the rackets. He was barely 21 and he'd.. ...already learned how to be a bastard. - You want a drink? - Yeah, uh...no, thanks. Well, I may have one. You used to be pretty good once. - Do you remember? - Yeah, I remember. I remember when you picked me up for hustling and I did you right at my apartment to beat the rap. That was another time, Marissa. Another place. Well, you can't blame a girl for trying, can you? What do you wanna know? Could Johnny Malone kill Tony? He was seen in the neighborhood the night of the murder. I don't think he has the balls. - Does he have an alibi? - Yeah. Well, that lets him out then, doesn't it? Only if we buy the alibi. If we don't, he's gonna yell "framed"! - Framed by who? - You, for one. Break his alibi, Jake. Then maybe we can talk. [intense music] Come on, baby. Let me have the money first. Oh, sure. - Mmm. - Now, wait. Let's do it here, huh? - You're one of those, huh? - I like to do it standing up. Fine. As long as we do it fast and quick. Do me a favor. Take off your top. That's great. Now, if you know what else I'd like very much I'd like to take off your stockings. You're a kinky one, aren't you? - Yeah. - Yeah, just do it real quick. - We don't have all day. - I know. [music continues] - Like that? - Yeah. - Great. - It's one of my favorites. [screaming] [screaming continues] [screaming stops] [sobbing] [panting] [beeping] [sobbing] [phone ringing] Hello? Mother, don't hang up, please, please. It's me. I have to talk to you. What are you taking? Memory loss pills? I told you never to call me on this telephone. In fact, don't call me on any phone. I'm in big trouble. I have no money for you. I don't want any money. I need to see you. If I don't wanna talk to you now why the hell would I wanna see your stupid face, huh? 'Cause you're my mother. I was your mother. Not anymore. How can that be? Because I said so. It's over. [sobbing] Mother, please. I should've had you committed along with your father. I need help. Now, you just listen to me.. ...and you listen carefully. You call me one more time and I'll have you disposed of like a stinking sack of garbage. You get that? [sobbing] Yes...mother. I hope you get it. [continues sobbing] Whores! Glad to see you in one piece. So how's the barracuda? Scared, I think. So what did you find out? Ralph Connors says Candy's the mother of a little girl. Who's the father? Some guy she ran down to Mexico with, who's into drugs. - Where is he now? - I don't know. Let's take a ride to the studio and lean on Miss Johnson a little hard and see what we can find out. When do we talk to Fred about Collins? We'll do that now. Meet me in the car. - I'll be right there. - Okay. Fred. What's the rap? Well, Monica here wasn't satisfied with the money for the trick, so she decided to relieve the John of his wallet. I-I'm sure it was a misunderstanding. Jake, he gave it to me. Credit cards and all. Um, Edwards, uh I want you to take real good care of this little lady, huh. - I was working, Jake. - I'll be right over, darling. Oh, my God, did you see those? Brenda told you about Collins, right? Oh, yeah. I mean, what a fucking shocker that was. I think I can get this babe to be the bait. We've got enough on her to make it worth her while. Don't let anybody spring her. We'll be back in a couple of hours. Hey, I'll watch her like a hawk. Take your time, huh. Anything Ralph told you I could tell you better. Is that right? I don't like the idea of you snooping around behind my back. Now, I don't like the idea of you lying to me. Johnny Malone was not with you. We have a material witness that puts him on the scene. That makes you an accessory. Why are you doing this to me, Jake? You got any idea what it's like in the slam? You know what a time those bitches are gonna have with you? You know what they'd do to you inside? Has Johnny got something on you? - No. - Is it the child? Did Ralph tell you about her? Yes. Are you afraid Johnny's going to harm your little girl? Yeah. My baby. I'm so afraid. He told me he'd kill my baby. Johnny proved to me that he's got her. That's why I lied to you. - Where? - I don't know. - How old is it? - She's five years old. She's got blonde hair, dark eyes. It's Johnny's, you know. It's his baby. It's his? And you think he's gonna kill his own kid? Think Candy, for Christ's sake, where could he have taken her? She might have her. - Who's she? - Johnny's mother. The child's grandmother. She'd do anything for Johnny. Where does she live? [soft rock music] Fred? Okay, Monica. This ain't funny. The DA's got enough to put you away. - You think so, huh? - I know it. We wanna make a trade, Monica. You help us out and you go scot free. What do I have to do? Monica, you've heard of the street killings, haven't you? Sure. We want you to help us track the guy. How? He only kills streetwalkers. I don't operate on the street. We want you to. Just one time. No way, Jose. I'm not doing it. Now, Monica.. ...I've been talking to 'em for you and I really think it's the only way you can get outta here. I'm liable to get my throat cut. That won't happen. We're gonna be there. We want you to wear this sweater. It's made with steel threads. That's hard to believe. Monica, we're not gonna get you hurt. We've tested this thing. You can't cut it with a chain saw. I want the deal on paper. You got it. [intense music] [gunshot] [tires screeching] [music continues] Shit. Somebody wasted Manuel Lopez last night. Oh, no! Do you think it was Johnny Malone? That or framed to look like him. But even he's not dumb enough to pull a stunt like that. - How did he die? - Drive-by shooter. What now? Two things. Monica goes on the street tomorrow night. I've already told Fred Gavin. Collins gets off at noon. What else? I'll check out the information I got on the kid. We need a warrant. What's wrong? This whole thing is wrong. I know I've missed something. I just can't put my finger on it. - Like what? - I don't know. - Just don't know. - You make me laugh sometimes. You and your premonitions of doom. [Jake] Go around the back. [dog barking] [rings doorbell] [knocking on door] [intense music] Anybody home? [music continues] [ticking] Jake! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God. Oh. No, just stay still. Lie there. I'll phone for help. [music continues] [grunting] He had a premonition. I just should have listened to him. Cut it out, Brenda. He was set up. Look, stop torturing yourself. It's not your fault. Hey, how is he anyway? Well, he's out of intensive care. You know, I never could figure you two out. What is it, huh? I think she's in love.. [laughing] Oh, I don't know, Fred. Maybe when Jake gets out of the hospital I'll sit down and figure it out. Well, don't worry, Brenda. Jake is tough. - He's gonna be alright. - Candy Johnson is outta town. And Johnny Malone has completely disappeared. Well, the chief says that you're calling the shots on both cases now. - So what's our next move? - Just as planned. We put Monica back on the street tonight. Oh, alright. Let's do it. [intense music] Collins is just leaving a bar. [music continues] He's headed down Sixth Street. We got it. Pull over, Fred. - I'm scared, you guys. - Piece of cake, Monica. We're right behind you. [music continues] Hey, baby. You're beautiful. You take American Express? Not now, honey. Try me later. I'm waiting on my pimp. Pimp-shmimp. Why don't you and I take a little ride? I wouldn't wait around here if I were you. My man is big and bad and mean as a junkyard dog. Hello, gorgeous. I saw that guy you turned down. He must've...been some sort of creep, huh? Huh, creepiest. Are you ready for some action? I got big bucks. What do you think I'm doing? Selling Girl Scout cookies? What do you think I'm doing here? Hold it, Collins. Move and you're a dead man. Brende, Gavin! - 'Help.' - Let her go, Collins. Drop it! Stay back! Stay back, or I'll slit her throat. - I mean it. - Let her go! - Careful now. - You stay fucking back. Stop it, bitch! [siren wailing] [tires screeching] [siren wailing continues] Fuck you. [gunshots] [tires screeching] [gunshots] [tires screeching] [tires screeching] [crashing] [grunting] [siren wailing] [screaming] - Get out of the car. - 'There's no way out now.' [Collins screaming] Oh, God, Help me. Help, get somebody! Help. Son of a bitch. Help me! Help. [screaming continues] Help me! [screaming continues] [siren blaring] He must have been wearing polyester. He went up like a Roman candle. So he had a little taste of hell even before he got there, huh? Speaking of hell.. ..you look a little toasty yourself. [sighs] Hmm. You got good hands, Brenda. I like the way you touch me. I can feel the care in them. Find out if anybody has ever seen Candy's kid. I don't believe that child exists. I think it's all bullshit. But somehow there's Candy, Johnny, Marissa.. ...somehow there's, there's some, there's some.. You get some rest. I'm going back to work. I'll check in with you later. - Hey. - Hmm? Um, thanks for the flowers. Keep your butt covered. I need you to remain in one piece. [sighs] - Come in, sergeant. - Hello, Marissa. Hi. God, I'm so sorry to hear about Jake's accident. Oh, he's going to be alright. Whoever made that Mickey Mouse bomb is sure an idiot. Well, I know you must feel terrible. Well, I didn't come here for solace. I need some information. Jake told me that you used to be acquainted with Johnny Malone? That's right. And Candy Johnson. Do you know her? The actress? No. Well, Candy and Johnny have both disappeared and I'm sure they're together. Have you any ideas? Oh, God, no. It's been years since I've even talked to that scum Johnny. Can I fix you a drink? Mmm, maybe some coffee. [slow rock music] Wanda! - 'Hi!' - Hi. - What have you got for me? - I got your glasses. Thanks. And what else? Where did you come from? I just got this info. I've got a sixth sense. What is it? Lookit, Johnny is shacked up with this dancer who happens to be at the same club that Jake's at. You know where this dancer lives? No. Did you know that Johnny is a hot item these days? - He's not only hot with cops. - Yeah. You've any idea where I might be able to find him? Well, lookit, he's usually at this club around 10. Right. Thanks, Wanda. - I owe you one. - I know you do. - Take care. - 'Alright. Bye.' [sighs] [upbeat music] I'm looking for Johnny Malone. Corner table at the bar. Thanks. Hello, Johnny. May I sit down? I've been looking all over for you - Where have you been holed up? - None of your business. That's no way to treat an old friend. Hey, too bad about Jake, huh? Sympathetic fellow, aren't you? - Yeah. - Come on. Don't you like me? I don't know what you mean. Well, uh...don't you find me physically attractive? You're okay. Well, uh, would you like to make love to me? 'I don't go around fucking cops.' [Brenda] 'Come on, Johnny.' Okay. Let's go someplace. So you must have been with lots of girls? [scoffs] Yeah. Yeah, I've had my share. Candy Johnson? - Yeah, you know that. - Yeah, you and many others. Yeah? Well, it's a loose town, huh? What is it about you that all the girls like? You're serious, huh? Dead serious. Hey, what about Jake? Jake's not here. Mmm. You smell so good. Yeah? You like it? It's you. You know.. ...Marissa says you're a great lover. What are you talkin' about? Hey! What do you think we girls talk about? Make-up and hair? We talk about guys. Yeah? Well, what did she say? She says you're the best. Except...you got scared and ran away. Yeah? Look, I'm not sayin' nothin'. Hey, Johnny. You don't have to say nothin' that I don't already know. I know you made out with both of them. So what? So now I don't know which one of those bitches framed you for murder. What? W-w-what? Framed me? You're a bigger fool than I thought you were, Johnny. - Hey, wait, wait, wait. Whoa! - Back off. Hey.. ...you'll never know what you missed. I'll just have to make a wild guess. You...are a liar. And a cop. Thanks for the call, huh. It does look good on the record. You're a good cop, Fred. You deserve it. Yeah, I know. So what are you gonna do now that you've got some time off? When Jake get's out of the hospital we're moving in together. No! You're kidding. Hey, that's terrific. So I'm gonna use my spare time to find us a bigger place. You're breakin' my heart, you know that? Take care, Fred. - Brenda! - Come on. Come on. - Hey, guys! Hold on to her. - You're sick! This guy is manhandling me and for no reason. What did she do this time? I'm arresting her for lewd and indecent exposure. What? I caught her dancing half nude in front of Vinnie's Bar And Grill. You're like totally off your rocker. Wanda, I'm shocked. Not nearly as shocked as Vinnie. He ain't seen a broad naked in 20 years. Come on. Let's go. Brenda, it ain't fair. You gotta get me outta this. God, you owe me one. I will Wanda. I need some time. Well, like when? When? Let her go. I owe her. I owe her. [scoffs] [Jake] '"And possibly I like the thrill' "of under me, you, so quiet. - You." - Oh. Jake. Yeah. Do you think we have a chance together? You mean like, uh...permanently? Yeah. Something like that. Well, I think.. ...that's a distinct possibility. There's nothing that gives one a sense of instant power like having this in your hands. But how could you.. I mean isn't that hard to shoot? Not for me. Hmm. I've always loved guns.. ...ever since I was a kid. I guess it's the boy in me. [intense music] Now there's no one. There's no one to keep us apart. [music continues] Oh, yeah. [music continues] Good evening, ladies. You probably gonna want to put some clothes on. The heater in my car doesn't work. Don't do anything stupid. You've already been dumb enough. 'The thing that gets me is why?' You killed two people. You tried to kill two more and for what? For what? So you can make love to each other? Is that it? I swear.. ...I don't understand anything about anything in this world. Come on. Get up. [soft rock music] Hey, baby. You wanna date? Just tell me how you like it? I'll like it any way you wanna give it to me.
