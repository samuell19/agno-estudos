(male #1) I think it's time you propose to my daughter, Harrison. You've proven yourself as a top level executive, and it's time to, uh, move you into the CEO position. (Harrison) Conrad, I'm honored that you think of me this way. In fact, I'd hoped this would be the end result of my time with Samantha. Her mother has already chosen an engagement ring that she knows is Samantha's taste, so that saves you from that tedious task. [sighs] Just put the ring on her finger and Cassandra will start the wedding preparations. I'm not going to marry you, so don't bother asking. I'm not a piece of property that you can use to secure a business deal. Don't you think you're over reacting? Hardly. I don't love you, and you don't love me. I care about you, Samantha. That's enough for me. Well, it's not enough for me. I deserve better and I will not marry you. Stop being so dramatic, Samantha. The arrangements have been made. You and Harrison will be getting married. Well, it's going to be hard to have a wedding without a bride. - Where you going? - I don't know. But I'm leaving this house and I'm not coming back until you accept that I will not marry someone that I don't love. If you walk out that door you leave with nothing but the clothes on your back. Samantha, you can't leave. Why don't we have Maggie make us a cup of tea and we can talk about this? There is nothing to talk about. I love you, mother, but I won't be bartered in a business deal and I won't marry some man I don't love. Don't be ridiculous, Samantha. You can't possibly mean to leave all this. My life has to mean more than this. You're not gonna get very far before you realize what a huge mistake you've made. Well, that's a chance I'll have to take. [Samantha sighs] [engine rumbling] [instrumental music] [engine rumbling] Taxi! - Hi. - Where can I take you tonight? To your favorite bar. The place I go to is a bit on the unrefined side. That's exactly what I'm counting on. [instrumental music] Last call. Tara, who's that cupcake? [scoffs] I have no idea. She slid onto the bar stool asked me for the dirtiest-named drink on the menu. So I gave her a Royal Fuck. She downs it in one go. Tells me to keep 'em coming. The stronger and dirtier the better. Now she's going to get Deep Throat. Thanks. - See you later, Saint. - Goodnight, Ted. Charlie, be safe out there, guys. Thank you. [clears throat] [sighs] Hey, Tara, I got that, you got a midterm tomorrow. Go home, study, get a good night's sleep. Thank you, let me get the blonde to close out her tab and then I'll head out. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of her. Of course you will, St. Clay. I will take care of her like I would any other tipsy patron. She will pay her tab, I will call her a cab. The cab will take her home. Making sure she gets home safely is all part of my responsibility as the owner of this bar. Nothing more. Justify it all you want, St. Clay. - But you're a good guy. - Goodnight, Tara. See you tomorrow. Elijah, walk Tara to her car on your way out. Thanks, buddy. Good work today. - Bye. - Bye. You... [giggles] You are so freaking hot. I think that I need another Royal Fuck. [giggles] Or maybe you can give me a Screaming Orgasm. You know, I have never asked a guy for a Screaming Orgasm. But this one was so good, that I think I need another. I think you've had enough Royal Fucks and Screaming Orgasms for one night, cupcake. Cupcake? I love cupcakes. I love to eat them and I love to make them and when no one's looking I like to lick the frosting. [clears throat] (Samantha) That, uh, that Blow Job was very, very ta... tasty too. So maybe I could have another one of those. I'm sorry, but the bar is closed. And it's getting late. So if you like to settle your tab maybe we can get you on your way home. Yeah. Ooh. - Ooh. - Ah. Careful with your bag. [chuckles] Thank you. It didn't work, did it? No, do you have another form of payment you'd like to use? Nope, none of them will work. He actually did it. My father completely cut me off. [sighs] This room is starting to spin and I... I think your face is getting a little fuzzy. Uh, Samantha, maybe I can have your cell phone and I can call somebody. Nope. I got rid of it. I don't want my father to find out where I am. Okay. Okay. Well, um, can I see your ID? I can look up your address, and have somebody take you home, it's okay. No, no, no. I-I can't go home. Don't make me go home. Oh. Oh, my God, what did I just do? I don't have anything. I don't have any money. I have nowhere to go. Whoa. Oh, it's okay, it's alright. I don't know, I don't know what to do. I'm so tired and I don't know what to do. It's okay. Oh, alright, alright. Okay. Okay, it's alright. It's... No, no, no. It's okay. It's alright. Careful, careful. There is stairs here. Okay? Okay. Yeah, yeah. - So... - Just... No, it's okay. - Take a step. Alright... - Whoo! Alright, alright. Alright, hang on, hang on. Hang on a second. Okay, we're just going to walk you straight back there. To the couch, okay? Okay? Just to the couch. Come on. You okay? - I fell kinda dizzy. - Okay, it's alright. Hang on. - It's okay? - I don't feel so good. Okay, come on, cupcake. You and me are going to the bathroom. Let's go. Hang on. Hang on. Okay. It's alright. It's alright. There you go. Hey, you're okay. It's alright. It's alright. Okay. It's okay. That was disgusting. I know I'm all messy. Oh, yeah, you're a hot mess alright. No, you're a hot mess. There we go. I think that I need to take a shower. Oh! I need to take a shower. Okay, I tell you what. How about I give you a fresh shirt and you can lay down on my bed and take a nap? No, I stink. Oh, yeah, you do. There is stuff in my hair. And if I don't get a shower, I'm gonna be sick again from that smell. Okay. Okay. Now let me take this off, alright? There we go. Oh... Leave it. - No, I need to take... - No, no! Well, you don't have to be so grumpy. Okay, there we go. You're so cute. Okay, let's get the jewelry off. Okay. There we go. Just gonna get your watch off too, is that okay? There we go. Okay. You are so freaking hot. Alright, cupcake, let's do this. - We're gonna do it? - No, no. We're gonna take a shower and I'm not letting you get in there when you can barely stand up on your own. Come on. [rings rattling] Just gonna put on a shirt, okay? I got you, I got you. Stand right here. Alright, okay. You good? Good. Look at that. I'm just gonna... Hang on one second. I'm just gonna take your... I'm gonna take this off. There we go. Good, good, good. Okay. Okay. Okay, I'm at the... I'm gonna take these off now. It's alright. Okay. - Okay, let us go over here. - Okay. Alright. I got you. I got you. There you go. Thank you for taking care of me. Hm.

Hi. Have a seat. How are you feeling? Better than last night. But my pounding head, and my sore body are clearly protesting all the drinks I indulged in. Yeah. [chuckles] You're definitely a cupcake. Why do you keep calling me that? Because you're a lightweight and you can't handle your liquor. - Coffee? - Sure. Mm. - Cream, if you have it. - I sure do. Oh, you're gonna need something in your stomach. Made you some toast. Thanks. I don't even know your name. I'm Clay. Clay Kincaid. I'm Samantha. So the bar is yours? Yeah. How did your cat lose it's eye? Found her out behind the bar when she was just a kitten. That left eye was pretty infected. The vet had no choice but to take the eye and stitch it shut. And you kept her. Yeah. She needed a home. I... I'm really sorry about last night. On which part? Well, all of it, but especially the part where I got sick. And you had to deal with me staying here because I have nowhere else to go. Where do you plan on going this morning? I don't know. But I'm not going back home. Samantha, are you in some kind of trouble? Last night you said something about your dad cutting you off and you had to get rid of your cell phone because you were afraid somebody was gonna find you? Yeah, I know that sounds bad. Um, I'm not in any trouble. And I'm not in any danger. But it is true that I don't want my father to know where I am. Why not? [sighs] Have you ever heard of Jameson Global? Oh... You're Samantha Jameson. Last night I found out that my father expects me to marry a man, that I have been dating for the past eight months. His name is Harrison Blackwell III. And my father has been grooming him to be CEO which apparently comes with the stipulation of Harrison marrying me to keep the company in the family. And you're upset that he'll be marrying you for a promotion. No, I'm furious that my father is demanding that I marry someone that I don't love. - Demanding? - Yes. Demanding as in, not giving me a choice in the matter, and expecting me to fall in line with his wishes and do as I'm told. Being the daughter of Conrad Jameson comes with a certain obligations, one of which is obviously an arranged marriage. I won't let anyone dictate who I spend the rest of my life with, especially not my father. So you ran away from home? [chuckles] That sounds so juvenile, but yes, that is 100% accurate. Honestly, I should have left a long time ago and I hate that I have let my parents run my life this long. Okay, so now that you ran away, what do you plan on doing? I don't know. I didn't... I didn't really have a plan beyond getting away. I know this is more than I have the right to ask, but could I stay here? Until I figure things out. I won't be in your way and I can sleep on your couch and I swear you won't even know I am here. I have no money, no place to stay I can't even buy a meal, or a hotel room. Obviously I didn't think things through last night, but I don't regret leaving home and I'm determined to make it on my own. I could work in your bar, and make some money until I have enough to get a place of my own, which shouldn't take too long. Please. Uh, Samantha, I don't think that is such a good idea. Please, Clay, I just need someone to give me the chance to prove myself. [sighs] Okay. Consider yourself hired as a bar waitress. You can start tonight and you can stay here until you can figure out a place of your own. I'm gonna call Katrina, she's my brother's best friend. She'll take you shopping for some clothes and toiletries. I will pay you back for everything. Mm. Thank you. Thank you, Clay. [moaning] [gasping] You are playing with the hottest kinda fire there is, cupcake. Well, you didn't seem to mind a few moments ago. I'm not a gentleman, Samantha. I don't do soft and gentle and sweet. I like to control and fuck so hard and deep that you'll scream and be sore the next day. What, what if that's what I want? That's not gonna happen. If you're gonna be staying here we need to set some rules. I'm 26 years old and I have spent my entire life following rules. I am done with rules. I'm done being a straight-laced good girl, and the woman in me wants passion and excitement and a man that can give me both. I'm not that man. And you're being wild and rebellious now that you got a little freedom. And you like the way that it feels. But there is no way I'm gonna let you do something that you're going to regret. Thank you so much for the dress and the shoes. Yeah, it's not a problem. Though I have to say, I've never known Clay to let a woman spend the night at his place, let alone move in so quickly. Oh, well, I'm only staying here temporarily, until I figure some things out. I know the whole Clay thing, staying with him and working at the bar, it seems odd. Oh, it's not odd at all. That's what St. Clay does. He takes care of people. We gotta get going. I have two hours until Mason expects me back at the shop. But honestly, he can kiss my ass for making such a demand. I'm not his personal slave. - Mason? - That's one of Clay's brothers. And then there is also Levi, the youngest of the three. - Are they close? - Yeah, they're really close. The three of them have been through so much shit together, there is nothing they wouldn't do for each other. (Katrina) Yeah, I met Mason when I was 14. And we, we went to the same high school. We bonded over something in common. And we've pretty much been best friends since. - So you guys work together now? - I work for him. He owns a tattoo shop a few streets over, Inked. I manage the place, do accounting and pretty much keep his shit together. Occasionally I draw art work for clients, but I don't do the actual tattooing. Oh, did Mason do all those butterflies? Um, no, somebody else did. - Well, they're beautiful. - Thank you. Come on, let's spend some Clay's money. I just need the basics to get me through my first pay check. Oh, trust me, you're going to have money before your first paycheck. A pair of tight fitted jeans, to wear with a Kincaid t-shirt and I guarantee the guys coming to the bar are going to be throwing tips your way. Okay. What the hell is she doing here? And why is she wearing a bar uniform? (Clay) Because she needed a job. And since everybody is going to find out anyway, yes, she is staying with me in my apartment for the next week or so. [scoffs] You've got to be joking. I thought you were just going to help her out, like any other tipsy bar patron. Make sure she got home and all that. Hey, I'm ready to get started. Where do you need me? Since Clay seems incapable of speaking at the moment I am Tara. Hey, I'm Samantha. Okay, let's have Amanda give you a crash course on what to expect tonight. Taking drink orders, everything. - That would be great. - Amanda? She's gonna help you out for the first few hours, but after a certain point we're gonna be slammed in. You're gonna have a section all to yourself. Good thing I'm a quick learner. [glasses rattling] You just couldn't resist helping out that damsel in distress, could you? - Don't worry about it. - Why? She's not gonna be here very long. Why is that? Because she's never worked a day in her life in a bar. She has no idea, what she is in for. So you think tonight's rowdy crowd is gonna scare her back to wherever the hell she came from? That's the plan. Is there something going on between you two? Because for a minute there while you were staring at her like a deaf mute, it looked like you were going to vault yourself over the bar and tackle her and do all sorts of dirty things to her. Okay, you have quite an imagination. - Just be careful, Clay. - I... Nothing is going on. Okay, you know what? This conversation is over. I'm gonna go see if Hank needs any help in the kitchen before happy hour starts. - Stubborn ass. - I heard that! Hey, Hank, Elijah. You guys good back here? - Oh, yeah. - We're good, boss. Elijah, grab that for me. Good. [indistinct chatter] [bell rings] They're gonna try to get under your skin. - You can't let them. Okay? - Okay. 'Cause that's what they're trying to do. Hi. Okay. It's on me. Enjoy. And here is your beer. Oh, thank... Thanks. Jesus, Clay. That scowl's gonna scare away customers. Or maybe that's your intention. To intimidate the hell outta every guy in here so they don't touch your shiny new toy? She's not my shiny new anything. What are you doing here anyway? You never come in for ladies night. I'm providing moral support. For Samantha? Yeah, I thought it'd be nice for her to see a familiar face tonight. I, I take it you guys, uh, hit it off today? She's actually really nice. For a rich girl. And you know she's rich based on what exactly? Well, when I picked her up, she was carrying a $3000 Louis Vuitton purse. Hey, can I get two shots of whisky and a... - Thanks. - You got it. - Clay. - Tessa. Everything okay? Your brother is in the women's restroom banging some chick when I really need to pee right now. - Mason. - Uh, who else? You obviously think that Levi would do anything so indecent? (Tessa) Look, since he's not talking to me, can you please just go over there and take care of the problem? - Yes. - Please. Well, it's about dam time, Romeo. What the fuck were you doing in the women's restroom? It's called getting laid. You should try it some time, big brother. Might improve your testy mood. Mellow you out some. My mood is fine. I don't appreciate you being so crass in my bar. If you were anybody else, I'd have you thrown out on your ass. Luckily I'm in good with the owner. Jesus, Mason, can you keep it in your pants for just one night? Why would I do that, kitty-kat? I don't know, so you don't catch something, and your dick falls off. Not gonna happen, condoms first. - Always. - You're gross. And disgusting. So you've told me many times before. But you're my very best friend. And I know deep down inside, you secretly love me despite all my faults. Hey, I'm so sorry. I punched in the wrong order again. I mean, who knew there were so many Collinses? This guy wanted a John Collins. Okay, so I know this is fourth time I have messed up my cocktail orders and I'm wasting your profits because you can't re-serve the drinks, so just... Take the costs out of my pay check. It's alright, cupcake. It's all a part of the learning curve. Cupcake? Is that your name? Because you look damn sweet to me. No. My name is Samantha. That's a nick name Clay gave me because I'm a lightweight when I'm drinking. Did he now? Samantha, this is Mason. He's... He's a man whore. Ooh, careful, kitty-kat. You're starting to sound jealous. I'm not jealous. I'm just telling Samantha how it is to keep her distance. Because you, Mason Kincaid, are a slut. You say that like it's a bad thing. It was nice to meet you, Mason. So you need help breaking in the new bar waitress? Dude, don't be an asshole! She's off limits. She's staying with Clay. Get the fuck out. Are you serious? Did you take in another stray and decide to keep her, Saint Clay? It's only temporary until she can figure out someplace on her own, okay? And before you ask, no, we are not sleeping together. Too bad for you. Hm. I'll see you later, kitty-kat. Oh, I might be in late tomorrow morning depending on how my night ends. And that is why I don't come in on ladies' night. ♪ And the feeling's right ♪ Hey, baby, what's up? Oh, my God, you're looking good. I'm gonna get you a new drink. That would be great.. - Thanks so much for helping me. - No problem. You're doing great. See you, Elijah. Oh, bye, Amanda. [sighs] - Hi. - Hi. You doin' alright? No. I feel like I'm hung over and I didn't even drink tonight. And my feet are killing me, and I am starving. Did you have lunch before coming to work? I had a burger at a fast-food place with Katrina. You should have taken a break and ordered something from the kitchen, everybody eats for free during their shift. I think I'm just gonna lay my head right down here and go to sleep. Hang on a second, I'll be right back. Tan-ta-na-na! Thank you. I will eat in a second. I am just finishing counting out my tips. I had no idea how much money you can make tip wise because I've never done this. This is way more than I anticipated. Okay. So, this is for the clothing and the toiletries I bought today. And I'm hanging on to a little bit for incidentals but if I make this much every night, I should have paid you back in no time and then I can start looking for my own place and I'll be out of your way. You did well tonight. You sound surprised. Well, maybe I am. You pick these up pretty quick for not having any experience... I will have you know that I graduated. Summa Cum Laude from Northwestern University with a degree in political science. Wow, what do you use a big fancy degree like that for? I don't. I was thinking about going to law school but my parents nixed that idea. You wanted to go to law school? Well, I, I wanted to do something for me and that wasn't allowed. After all, why do you need a law degree if you're just expected to get married and be some man's arm candy, stay at home, and make babies? So-so you don't want to get married and have babies? Yeah, of course I do. I just want to do that with a man I'm in love with and not someone who's been handpicked for me. I want, I need more for my life. Alright, I get your need to be self-sufficient, but... you don't want to be a waitress the rest of your life. But you have to admit it's kind of an interesting start to whatever is to come. Okay, if you could do anything, be anything in the world... what would it be? I would be a pastry chef. Really? Okay, when I was growing up, I used to sneak into the kitchen and hang out with our, with our housekeeper Maggie when she was making desserts, she taught me to bake... cakes and pastries and pies and I, I loved every second of it. I actually went to culinary school two years ago and I was certified as a pastry chef but my, my parents didn't take that seriously either. But you did go. If it makes you happy, you should do it. Well, I've seriously thought about it and I just think with no real job experience as, as a pastry chef or anything, for that matter, I don't think that a one-star restaurant would consider hiring me let alone a five-star establishment. Well, you won't know unless you try it, right? Yeah. So, what about you? How did you end up owning a bar? Um, well, Jerry was the guy that owned the bar and he hired me when I was 16. God, I needed a job so bad. He started me out sweepin' floors, takin' out the trash, you know, just general clean up. Worked my ass off, and the harder I worked the more he taught me about the business. He was like this father figure to me, since I didn't really have one. When I turned 21, he put me behind the bar. Taught me everything I know. Just kind, caring, selfless. Oh, he was the best. You said was. Yeah, uh, he had a heart attack and passed away when I was 24, that's actually how I found out that I owned the bar. He didn't have a wife, a family. No kids. You know, Katrina was right, you are nothing like your brother Mason. [laughs] Thank God I'm not like Mason. What, what exactly did Katrina tell you about me? She said that you are the responsible one. Mm. Yeah. Why do people call you "Saint?" Uh, well, the nickname actually comes from Mason, believe it or not. He calls me saint 'cause I have a tendency to help other people. Like, Hank, and Elijah, and me. Yeah. I didn't have the, uh... the best life before Jerry. And now I'm fortunate enough to be in a position where I can help a lot of people. Even if it's something as simple as giving them a job. I love how you see the good in people. Well, it wasn't always that way. Your life is so opposite of how I grew up. I had everything handed to me and I took it for granted. And I just... I just... In that world, everything was so superficial and I just felt so suffocated and every time that I tried to better myself or make a difference, I was reminded that I'm a Jameson and there are expectations I have to live up to, and what I want doesn't matter. Well, look at you now, all stubborn and rebellious. Yeah. Yeah, I... I like how it feels. I kinda like being a bad girl. It feels... It feels quite liberating. [instrumental music] Touch me, Clay. Samantha, I already warned you this morning. What, that you're not a gentleman? That you don't like it... sweet or soft and gentle. No. Well, I don't need a warning, Clay. I, I thought about it all day what you said to me and about what you wanna do to me, and I asked myself if that's what I want too. You have no idea what you want. That's where you're wrong. I know exactly what I want and I, I want you... more than I've ever wanted another man. I am trying really, really hard... not to take advantage of what you're offering. And that kiss this morning... just thinking about it makes me... Wet. Well, that's definitely one of the things, but it makes me think about everything that I want. Your mouth on me and your tongue giving me pleasure and what it would feel like for you to slip deep, deep inside of me. I don't want to be a good girl anymore, Clay. I want to be very, very bad with you, Saint Clay. I'm not a saint, cupcake. Especially when it comes to fucking. Well, that's a good thing because I don't want a saint, I want a sinner.

Thanks. What's up, Levi? Did you talk to Mason? Not personally. Though he did text me to tell me you have a woman living with you. You think big news like that would come directly from you instead. She's not living with me in the way that you mean. It doesn't matter why she's living with you the fact that you let a woman stay in your place for more than one night is quite uh, shocking and fascinating... Okay, she didn't have anywhere else to go, I'm just helping her get back on her feet. Oh, it's very charitable of you. Hey, can I get two shots of whiskey and a couple of beers... I take it she's the gorgeous blonde over there? Yeah, that's her. Samantha. Also known as cupcake. Fuck Mason and his big mouth. Did you really expect anything less from Mason? Hey, handsome, what can I do for you? Uh, Samantha, this is my other brother Levi. He's a cop with the Chicago PD. - Hi, it's so nice to meet you. - Likewise. So you, you're the respectable brother? - Excuse me? - Katrina. Ah, yes, I suppose I am the respectable one, at least compared to Mason. That's an understatement, there's a reason why Katrina calls him a man whore. I just think Mason hasn't found the right woman yet. That is an optimistic thought, even for Mason. The man's got a point. I have to go back to work. I'm sure I'll see you around. This one's different... isn't she? Whatever may or may not be going on is just casual. And only until she can figure out what she's doing next. Mm-hm. What? Spit it out! - You're an idiot. - You're an idiot. I know what I'm doing. You don't know shit. I saw the way she looked at you. But more importantly, I noticed the way you looked at her. Like you'd vault over this bar if any guy in this place so much as laid a hand on her. Never seen such a possessive look in your eyes, that's how I know she's different. I barely know her. Our mother didn't give us a reason to trust women. She didn't give a shit about us, and Wyatt was even worse, the bastard had no qualms beating the crap out of us. Shut up. How long are you gonna let what they did to us dictate your future and happiness? No one's perfect, hell, everyone's got a past. But no matter what you think or feel about what Wyatt did to you... you're a good person, Clay. Stop stirring shit up. If you just talk about it instead of pretending like it never happened, maybe you'd quit hiding behind this bar and maybe you wouldn't let this one worthwhile woman get away. Let it fucking go, dude. I don't need a lecture. And all that stuff has nothing to do with any kind of relationship that I have with Samantha. No. It's holding you back from having any kind of relationship at all. You don't always have to be so strong for everyone, Clay. And you don't have to carry the burden alone. If you remember, I was there too. I fucking remember everything. Now, if you're done analyzing me, you can see your way out. I have a lot of work to do. Of course you do. Have a good night, Clay. Fuck you for screwing up my night, asshole. You're welcome. Hey. You okay? I'm fine. - Hey. - Hey, what are you doing here? I have a delivery for you. I didn't order anything. You didn't, but Clay did. Or rather Clay told me what he wanted and I did all the ordering. There's no way he could have pulled this off without me. Bring it in, boys. I didn't know what exactly you needed so I told the consultant at the store to put together everything a new pastry chef would need. Oh, my God. So you should be well-equipped, I pretty much cleared out the bacon aisle at the grocery store. This is too much, he must have spent a small fortune. Clay didn't hesitate when I told him how much everything was. Well, I have to go say thank you. Tell you what, how about you start unpacking everything see what's inside and I'll go get Clay. Okay. [chuckles] [gasps] [chuckles] She liked everything? (Katrina) Are you kidding me? She loved it. I don't think I've ever seen a woman so thrilled to get kitchen appliances as a gift from a man. [chuckling] Well, that was fun. - Thank you again for everything. - Yeah. Couldn't have done it without you. It's my pleasure, anyway, I gotta run, but Samantha's waiting for you upstairs, so go and enjoy her excitement. - Okay. - And for the record, I like her. - A lot. - I do too. Bye. [whirring] Does, uh, everything meet with your approval? I can't believe you did all of this for me. Well, you want to be a pastry chef, you gotta be able to bake, I just supplied the means to make that happen. Thank you so much, Clay. You have no idea what this means to me. I will pay you back for everything, every single cent, I promise. It's a gift, cupcake, you don't have to pay something back that's a gift. I can. Okay, well, I'll tell you what, how about you repay me by making me your favorite dessert? Well, my favorite dessert isn't anything extravagant but if you want I can make you something fancier like a chocolate profiterole or an eclair. Do I look like somebody who eats chocolate whatever-they're-called and fancy eclairs? I want your favorite dessert. Okay. Will you, will you stay and keep me company? Sure.

Well, maybe the second, third or fourth best thing, but definitely not the best thing. You're so bad. Oh, I can be even badder. You want me to go on about those other things that are sweeter than candy? No, I want you to eat my cupcake. Mm. Oh, I've already had a taste of the best cupcake I'm ever gonna have. But if sit on my lap maybe I'll try this lemon one. - Thank you for indulging me. - Mm-hm. Better give me a bite quicker before I change my mind and eat you instead. [giggles] Hm. Hm. When I was a kid... When you were a kid, what? - Never mind. It's nothing. - No, no. What? It's obviously something. Were you not allowed to have cupcakes? [sighs] When I was a kid I didn't know what cupcakes were. How is that even possible? I mean, my brothers and I never really had a birthday party. The school we went to didn't allow outside food, not even on special occasions. We didn't have a TV. And all the groceries we got were from a local food bank. First time I saw a cupcake, I was walking home from school, I was like seven years old and I passed by this upscale bakery. I looked in the window and... [chuckles] I could not stop staring at them. I was so hungry. And that's when the woman inside came out and chased me away. Why would she do that to a little boy? You know, people in town saw me as this lowlife Kincaid, this bastard child of a... a crack whore. And having a poor, dirty little kid outside your store isn't very good for business. I'm so sorry. That's a long time ago. Well, I'll make you all the cupcakes that you like... whenever you want. You're the only cupcake I need. I do think you need a little frosting. [moaning] Fuck!

Mm, meringue-based, see, using those big ones again. - Just try the damn thing. - Okay. Mm. Every day you make something new. And every day I swear it's my favorite, but always those are like little tastes of heaven in my mouth. Next to you, of course. I need to talk to you. Oh, talking's overrated. Wouldn't you rather us go upstairs and... have me use my mouth for other things. How about after? It's kind of something that's important to me. Okay. Have a seat. First of all, thank you for letting me borrow your laptop for the past couple of days. Well, you're welcome, but that can't be what's so important. No. And so I've been thinking and considering all my options the past week, how do I move forward as a pastry chef. How does someone with no experience get a job. And what kind of environment do I want to work in and I, I just realized that I don't want to work in a restaurant. I want to work in a French bakery. Hm. I can see you doing that. You know Mason came near the break room the other day and he had one of those French pastries you made with the vanilla custard and the flaky whatever. And after eating it, he said that he was going to marry you and keep you in the kitchen and baking him pastries and pies all day. And what did you say to that? I told him over my fucking dead body. So, I, I contacted this woman that my mother used to hire to make pastries at different events we had at the house and her name is Adeline. She owns a French bakery and a catering business in downtown Chicago. So, I did my research and I read all the reviews all of which are nearly five stars. She has a phenomenal reputation. So, I worked up the nerve and I, I gave her a call. I, I didn't know you were looking for a job. Well, I didn't wanna say anything until it was more concrete. Well, anyway, I gave her a call and she wants to interview me next week for a position as a baker. It's great. That's exactly what you want. Although I hate losing such a good waitress. Well, there's something else I need to talk to you about. I, I'm going to look for my own place. I've taken advantage of your generosity for longer than I should have and you've been great but it's really past time. I mean, it's no trouble having you stay upstairs. Are you, are you sure you're in a position where you can afford something like that? Actually, yeah. I pawned my necklace and my watch and I should have more than enough for rent and other necessities so long as I budget carefully. Oh, you've been busy. Well, I have to think about my future. I can't stay here forever. [door opens] Um, that must be the beer delivery, I'm expecting. [bell ringing] Well, well, well. If it ain't Clay Kincaid. All grown up with a bar his very own. Get the fuck out of here. That any way to greet an old friend? Get the fuck out of my bar! (Wyatt) Whoo, whoo. [laughs] Oh. Not until we have a chat first. Oh, boy, ain't that a fine little piece of ass you got over there. You always were a stupid little fuck, weren't you? You come at me again and I swear to God I'll fuckin' gut you like I should all those years ago. Huh? And then I'll make your little whore watch you bleed out. - Go upstairs, Samantha. - Oh, don't worry, sweetheart. I-I ain't gonna stab lover boy unless he gives me a reason to. [breathing heavily] Hey, uh, Katrina, you need to send Mason over to the bar immediately. There's a man here that's threatening to kill Clay and... Uh, call Levi too. You and I have nothing to talk about, asshole. I think we do. I need some cash. Fifty grand to be exact. And you are gonna provide it to me by the end of the week. Yeah, well, I don't have that kind of money. And even if I did, you're the last person on earth I'd give it to. So get the fuck out of my bar. You will give me that cash or whoop, something bad is gonna happen to this bar. Or better yet, how about that sweet little blonde of yours? You know, the one with the wide innocent eyes. I'll bet you anything, she'll fetch at least 50 grand on the black market. I should have killed you when I had the chance. (Wyatt) Oh, yes, you should have. But you didn't. And so here we are. Nice little family reunion. Fifty grand. Make it happen, you got three days. Or we could let natural selection take its course. Do not fuck with me on this. Do not. If you do, the consequences will be brutal! Three days! I'll be in touch. [sighs] Fuck. [door opens] Jesus! Where the fuck is he? Where's Samantha? Is she okay? She was down here when Wyatt came in and saw him at his finest. Fucking asshole. (Clay) I sent her upstairs, she called you? She called Katrina. She insisted on coming with us. I sent her up to the apartment the backway, so Samantha wouldn't be alone. After all this time, what the hell did he want? Money. Fifty grand to be exact. Somehow he found out I own a bar and he needs a quick infusion of cash and he thinks I'm gonna give it to him. Fucker. You should have killed him, Clay. Man, you know I would've helped you bury the body or feed him to the sharks. Really? Dude, you're such a fucking killjoy. I'm just trying to save a pretty boy like you from going to prison and becoming someone's bitch. Yeah, I need a drink. [sighs] Wyatt, huh? Yeah. You okay? I'll be fine. I thought you could use something stronger than your normal pansy ass spritzer. Orange juice, straight up. Always a comedian, aren't you? Thanks, man. There's more, guys. Wyatt gave me three days to come up with the money. He sounded desperate, so I'm assuming he's in some kind of trouble. Yeah, well, he can rot in hell for all I care. But you're not thinking of actually giving him the money, are you? Well, it's not my first option, but he did threaten Samantha. Said that he could get 50 grand for her in the black market. Jesus. The fucker is into human trafficking now? Now we all know what he's capable of. I wouldn't be surprised. Bottom line is this. I can't keep Samantha locked up in my apartment forever. And I don't wanna give Wyatt what he wants. But if anything happened to her, it would kill me. Nothing's happening to her. Let me run his name in the system, I'm sure he's got a rap sheet a mile long. Look, the next time he comes in here we take him into custody and bust him for blackmail and extortion. So, he gets a slap on the wrist and he's back out on the street in two weeks? It's not ideal. But just give me 24 hours to see what I can come up with. I think feeding him to the sharks is still the better idea. Okay. I don't care what happens to me. I just need to know that she's gonna be okay. Consider it done. I'll get eyes on her ASAP. Thanks, man. Of course. [instrumental music] [thudding] [gasps] Clay, it's me. So, what's up? Jesus, I'm sorry. What're you doing up? I couldn't sleep, just like you. Go back to bed. Tell me how you got those scars. It doesn't matter. Every single thing about you matters to me including how you got those scars. Was it that man that came in today? Did he hurt you? Leave it alone. You don't have to keep everything bottled inside of you. Samantha, my past is dark and it's ugly and is twisted. And the last thing I want is to put images in your head that don't need to be there. So... leave me alone before I do something we'll both regret. I will never regret anything that I've done with you. Ever. [moaning] Samantha, I want you so fucking bad. I'm yours. [moaning] Thank you. [exhales] [sighs] You asked about the scars on my back. Yeah. Will you tell me? My mother was a, a crack addict and a prostitute. Mason, Levi, and I, we all have different fathers, all from a different John, we never knew them. We never had a man's influence in our lives. I mean, there were a lot of guys who lived with us but they were all addicts just like mom. And since she was never conscious or aware enough to take care of us, I took that on pretty young. That must have been so hard. I was six when Levi was born. Always made sure he had his bottle. Changed his diaper the best that I could. I made these serial sandwiches for Mason and I when we had food in the house, but... lot of times we just went to bed hungry. Why didn't Social Services step in? Well, we lived in the projects. Neighbors didn't care, so our mother was never reported. In her lucid moments whenever I complained, she... she put the fear of God in me. Said that if I told anybody, Social Services would split us up forever. That's awful. So, I went to school and I was a good kid because I was afraid if I did anything wrong I would lose my brothers. I did what I had to do, raise Mason, Levi the best way I could. Try to keep them out of trouble. They were lucky to have you. When I was 15, our mother got involved with Wyatt. He moved in, kept her doped up on pills, pimped her out for cash, All the while running these shitty little side businesses. And while she was out at night, he terrorized us. One of the things he'd do would be to, uh, pin me down on the ground and... press a lit cigarette into my back burning these... holes. That sick bastard would get off of me screaming. And the more I squirmed and cried, the more he pressed... harder and longer. But he didn't do it to my brothers. There were times when they would just stand there watching helplessly. I told them not to get involved. And one day our mother was arrested for possession solicitation and it was her fifth offence, so she was sentenced to 18 months and... somehow that bitch was able to appoint Wyatt as our legal guardian. And the abuse got worse. Why would she do that you and your brothers? Who knows. Probably made the most sense to her drug-addled brain. What happened to her? She served three months, had a stroke and died. And that's when Wyatt decided that we were now his property and that he was gonna do whatever he wanted. The thought of Wyatt being our legal guardian until I turned 18 scared the shit out of me. I knew he'd do anything and everything to go after Mason and Levi. Pimp 'em out, get them hooked on drugs. Anything. So, I, uh... I stole a butcher knife from a store... Tell me. I came home one day and... Wyatt had Levi cornered. He already backhanded him a few times. I told Levi to run and he locked himself in the bathroom. And then Wyatt came after me. I pulled the knife and it was so much running through me. I swore I was gonna kill the fucker. Wyatt was much stronger back then and we just got him locked. I pushed him back and gave him a nasty cut on the side of his face. - You gave him that scar? - Yeah. Stabbed him in the arm too. It was enough for him to realize that he couldn't mess with us anymore and he finally left. Haven't seen him until today. Your brothers were so young. What did you do after Wyatt was gone? Mason was 12 and Levi was 10. I wasn't gonna lose them to foster care so for the next couple of months until I turned 18 I worked any and every kind of job I could just to pay the bills and stay off the radar. Went dumpster diving for food. That's when... that's when Jerry saw me. And he gave me my first job here at the bar. Gave me my first weekly paycheck. Levi was a good kid. He tried to stay out of trouble but Mason... what a goddamn hellion. He was that at young, huh? I think Mason was just testing me because he was afraid I'd leave just like our mother. She may not have been there in a way that mattered but she was still mom. We never had a dad, so... the whole thing kinda messed with his head. Still does, I think. Your brothers are good men because of everything that you did for them. Except here we are... facing the man who fucked all of us up. I never thought I'd see him again. Hey. Hey. What's this? It's just been a long day. It's okay. What... Why are you packing? Samantha. [sighs] I'm going home. I... I don't understand. I thought... You're just gonna give up what you were fighting for? It's what I need to do. Okay. I don't want you leaving without some kind of security not without this issue with Wyatt resolved. I called my father and he's sending over his private car and personal security, so they should be here any minute. I have to go. [instrumental music] (Levi) Clay. Clay. Clay. Jesus! I know Samantha leaving has thrown you for a loop, but I need you to pay attention to what I'm about to tell you. I'm fine. What'd you find out about Wyatt? He has a warrant out for his arrest. - For what? - First-degree murder. What did he do? Uh, about a year ago a woman he was living with who's been arrested numerous times for drug possession, solicitation was found dead. His DNA was all over the crime scene, but they couldn't find him. Must've been layin' low so they couldn't catch him. Whoever's after him now must be scarier than going to prison. Well, the detective working the case is setting up a sting to bring him into custody whenever, wherever he tells you to meet him. There's more than enough evidence to bring Wyatt into custody. Murder is a capital charge, which means, life without parole. He's gonna rot in prison. All you need to do is let me know the time and the place as soon as you hear from Wyatt. And the PD's gonna take care of the rest. Chances are he's gonna come here first. Then tell him you got to pick up the cash and you'll meet him somewhere neutral. And then, call me with the details. Okay. Alright. And once that's done, you need to keep your ass here. Until I confirm we have Wyatt in custody. - Got it? - Got it. Thanks. Come here. We're gonna get him. Hey, sorry, buddy. We don't open till 4:00. Uh, actually, I'm here to speak with Clay Kincaid. That's me. Mind if I come in for a few minutes? Uh, sure. What can I do for you, Mister... Blackwell. Harrison Blackwell III. So, Samantha told you about me. Yes, she did. What can I do for you? I'm here to deliver a package. And I wanted to meet the man that Samantha has given up her new independent life for. Excuse me? She didn't tell you, did she? Tell me what? Samantha called her father yesterday and told him to that she needed money immediately. That you were in trouble, and that she wanted to help. And Conrad Jameson, as you've already surmised struck a bargain... her return home, an agreement to marry me in exchange for giving you 50 grand. The thing is, we've known all along where Samantha has been. The night she left, Conrad's security firm found out exactly where she was. They've updated Conrad daily, and when she ended up moving in with you and staying here, he was provided with a full background report on you as well. If Conrad knew where Samantha was why didn't he just come get her? He saw something in your report that assured him that you were trustworthy. So, he figured that Samantha just needed to sow some wild oats before she settled down... and married me. For the sake of the investment firm? Hm. Correct. I know Samantha doesn't love me. Quite frankly, I don't love her either. She's too spirited. She's way too independent. And I know she'd be miserable in a structured marriage like ours would be. She wants her own life, her own career. [sighs] And the fact that she gave it all up and agreed to her father's conditions in exchange for this money tells me just how important you are to her. Why, why are you telling me this? Despite everything, I'd rather see Samantha living the kind of life that she wants to... with the kind of person that's going to support her and make her happy. And that man is not me. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Kincaid. Thanks. [inhales sharply] [cell phone ringing] Wyatt... [instrumental music] He's on the move, he's on the move, get him. Hold it, hold it. Hold up, hold up. Wyatt Dawson, you're under arrest for murder. - Cuff him. - Hands behind your back. [cell phone vibrating] - Hey. - We got him. Samantha is safe. [sighs] [inhales] [exhales] [instrumental music] Clay Kincaid to see Conrad Jameson. Hi, good afternoon. Mr. Jameson. I appreciate the money you sent to help me out, but I'm returning all of it. I don't want it. I don't need it. In fact, you had to have known that I was sitting on a couple of million dollars in the bank since you did a background check on me. So, why bother? Two reasons actually. One, it worked to bring Samantha back home. And two, I wanted to see what kind of man you truly are. Well, to be honest with you, sir, I'm more than a little pissed to find out the money came with an ultimatum. I was getting little tired of waiting for my daughter to come to her senses and come home. So you blackmailed her? She's my child, I want the best for her. Then let her make her own decisions. Let her live her own life. That is, uh, difficult for a man like me. Well, sir, it's not about what you want. Hm. And just where do you think you fit into her life? Same answer, sir. It's not about what I want either. I would do anything to make Samantha happy. Happiness, the way you mean it is overrated. And you must be aware, you're all wrong for her. Well, I may not be a member of your investment firm, or someone from your... social circle, but I have never felt anything as right as being with Samantha. (Conrad) And you're confident that she feels the same? Yes. I am. [chuckles] Let me tell you something, son. I didn't like what I saw in your background check. Your past leaves a lot to be desired. But, the man you've become despite how you grew up... impresses me. I admire the way you have overcome adversity, raised your brothers, help people who are less fortunate. Well, you took care of Samantha when a lesser man would've taken advantage of her. Especially after finding out who she is, and, well, you know... what she's worth. Well, none of that matters to me. No offense. I believe you. Still, I would rather she marry Harrison. The firm will remain in the family. But here you are... And an hour ago, Samantha told her mother and me that despite our agreement she was going back to you tonight. She's determined to be with you. She's defiant, stubborn... She's independent and proud, just like you. [sighs] I don't want to lose my only child... which I will do, if I try to do anything to keep her away from you. I promise that I'll do everything in my power to give Samantha a good life. And I will protect her and respect her and be the kind of man who deserves to be with someone as special as she is. I'm counting on that. I love your daughter. Do you mean it? Cupcake, you should know by now that I always mean what I say. I love you. More than I ever thought I could love another person. And I don't wanna spend another day without you in it... ever. Come here. I love you so much, Clay. There is no way I could stay away from you. Me neither. [Conrad clears throat] Get used to it, dad! I am so sorry. Just don't ever leave me again. Never. Take me home. - Hey! - Thank you. - Welcome back home, Samantha. - Yes. - Oh, thank you. - Cheers, guys. - Cheers! - Cheers, guys!
