[gentle piano music] [yearning orchestral music] [panting] [camera clicks] [man in English] The mind may forget how they went, but the heart will remember how they felt. [upbeat instrumental music] [in Tagalog] What are the things in life you can never forget? - If you ask me, everything. - [alarm clock rings] [clock ticking] [in Taglish] I'm not kidding. I have hyperthymesia. [in English] Superior autobiographical memory. [in Tagalog] Sick, right? But for me... it's a disease. - Memories are a curse. - [gargles] The pain never leaves, and it keeps on hurting you over and over again. - That's a Tumblr quote. - [camera clicks] [in Taglish] The data say that less than 20 people in the world have it. [in English] So, yes, I'm unique as fuck. [cellphone dings] BRO, COVER FOR ME IN THE FIELD. SEND "YOUR TODAY IN HISTORY" ARTICLE FOR GFX. [in Taglish] But I'm not a genius. Just aware. [in English] And that helps me stay woke. [in Taglish] In this day and age, apart from abs, [in English] being socially woke is the new sexy. [keyboard clicking] [cellphone rings] - [in Taglish] Hello, Auntie Edith? - [in Tagalog] Grandpa's looking for you. You're there already? OK, I'll be there. [Edith] What time will you be here? Nel? Nel? Are you still there? [Nel] I'm on my way. See you there. So, that's my condition. - Hyperthy? - Hyperthymesia. It's difficult to pronounce. Can I just call it reverse amnesia? [in Taglish] Relax. Whatever you want, kid. But I remember everything. - [Doc] Hi, Nel. - [Nel] Doc. - [in English] RJ. Ready to go? - Yes. - [Doc] Where's your mommy? - [RJ] At the canteen. - I asked her to buy me... - [in Tagalog] Let me carry that. [doctor in English] Wow. Can I have some? [in Tagalog] Here we are. [in Taglish] After 148 days, the president has declared liberation and an end to the combat operations in Marawi. [in Tagalog] We welcome back our soldiers as they come home to their loved ones. - [Nel] Hey, bro! - I'm glad you're here. I just saw the news team there. [in English] Hi, sir! Manila Bulletin! [in Taglish] Anyway, I thought you were on leave. [in Tagalog] They didn't grant my request. [camera clicks] [in Taglish] Darn, it's corrupted! Did you take photos for social media? Yeah. I'll just replace the card. - [camera clicks] - [crowd cheers] [girl laughs] [in English] Will you marry me? [romantic piano music] Yes! [crowd cheering] [woman chuckles] - [camera clicks] - [crowd cheers] [crowd in Tagalog] One more time! One more time! [man] Bro, thanks for saving my ass. [chuckles] But Sir Edmund's going to kill me. [in Taglish] I don't have photo coverage for the Manila Bulletin Online. [Nel in English] Nothing's new. [man in Taglish] Thank you, bro. Nel, weren't you in a meeting with corporate last week? - Yes. - Mr. Chang was there, right? Yep. Blue suit. Red tie. He even asked you about your design. Yes! Thank you! Told you so! - Hey, bro! - Yo, bro! Thanks for covering for me. I owe you a drink. That's the 26th time you've offered that. But I've never got that drink. You're keeping count? Sir Nel? [in English] Nel! I want you here. And you, Libby. Now! [man in Taglish] Look! I asked this intern to clean my office. But she removed all the posts on my bulletin board! Even the most important posts! Let's give her a round of applause! [in Tagalog] Sorry, I thought it was all trash. Shut up! [in Taglish] I will fail you in your evaluation. [in Taglish] Sir, chill. Cut Libby some slack. [in Tagalog] You remember what it looked like, right? [Chuckles] [paper rustling] [upbeat music] Libby, don't you dare mess up again. [in Taglish] By the way, how's the Marawi homecoming coverage? I'm thinking, let's put out a photo essay in the Manila Bulletin Online, since the news article is already up. Sir, we just have one problem. "Sir, we just have one problem." Stupid! [in English] Sir, I took some photos for my blog. You can use them. [in Tagalog] I can do the write-up. [in English] Good job, Nel. [in Taglish] Well, to be fair, I will approve your vacation leave. [cellphone dings] [Nel in English] October 24, 2008. [man narrating message in English] [somber music] [in Tagalog] Bro... I think my profile was hacked. Don't you agree? [in Taglish] You were a sore loser in 2008. What's that? This is a throwback feature app. I forgot to turn it off. [man] You were already so cheesy back then. - Dude, here's my payment. - But I didn't post this. It's impossible that I'd forget about it. [in Tagalog] That's how your hypertensive works. - Right? - Hyperthymesia. Maybe that's for your ex. [in Taglish] That's right. 2009. High school. I only had one girlfriend back then. I thought you didn't post that? Why the sudden interest? [phone dings] HEY! YOU'RE HERE? GOT SOMETHING FOR ME? YES, I HAVE... ARE YOU IN CANDELARIA? I'M GOING HOME, KIKS. [man in Taglish] You're jealous over your best friend? - That's why we're here on a Monday night. - [Nel] That's not true. [man snickers] I thought you didn't want to get married. What's this? Adulting? [in Tagalog] Piss off! All my loved ones are leaving, one by one. Mom. Grandma. And now Kit's settling down? It's Monday and we're here. [woman singing in Tagalog] ♪ Have you thought about it? ♪ ♪ Because I'll be forgetting you ♪ ♪ Here it goes ♪ ♪ Here it goes ♪ ♪ I will also forget ♪ - Now, I know why we're here. - ♪ All your promises that meant nothing ♪ [in Taglish] I'm glad you accepted my friend request after 1,000 years. [woman in Tagalog] How are you? - [woman in Taglish] I heard you're famous. - [in Tagalog] That's not true. [in Taglish] It's still the same me. Nothing changed. [woman] We're both the same. Nothing's changed. SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, BRO! WHAT A SMOOTH TALKER. SAW HER PROFILE. SHE HAS A KID. Huh? DOES SHE HAVE A HUSBAND? How's your husband? [in Taglish] I don't have a husband. But I do have a child. [chuckles] Are you going to the reunion? [acoustic guitar music] [in Tagalog] Just stay there, OK? Your grandpa's on his way. [in Taglish] Wait for him. He bought you soda and Spanish bread. [in Tagalog] Don't go anywhere. - [grandma] Oh, he's here. - [grandpa] This one's for you. - [in Taglish] I thought this was soda. - That's better than soda. [in Tagalog] Sit over here. - Who's with you, child? - My grandma. [grandma] Come over here. I want to learn how to do that. OK, but we ran out of candles. I'll just get some from one of the other gravestones. That's bad. Haven't you watched the news special? About the haunted corpses in a cemetery? [laughs] That's not true. Just a second. When I come back, teach me how to do that. [wistful music] [music intensifies] What now? You're just going to mope? Cut the drama, it's All Souls' Day. [Nel] Blame Grandma. She didn't give me any warning. [in Taglish] Move on. She is already happy up there. You thought I forgot? You're late again. You just texted me. How does that make me late? [in Tagalog] I got here a while ago. I've just been driving around. If Grandma Perta were still alive, she'd hit you. [in Taglish] You know, she never hit me. - Never? - [in English] Never. November 1, 1999. [in Tagalog] You were stealing candles from the other tombstones. She didn't hit you? [chuckles] You know what, let's start. [laughing] Have a seat first. [Nel] You remember Grace? [Kit in Taglish] Yeah, your first girlfriend! She told me she was going to the reunion. - [in Tagalog] So? - [in Taglish] So, rekindle old flames? Don't mess with me at the party. Let me make my own move. You applied for leave because of Grace, right? I'd already requested that leave before I got invited to the reunion. Usually, in romcoms, you end up with your first love. So, Ben's your first love? - [in Tagalog] Hey! - [tires screech, car horn blares] - Hey! - What? - I'll make this idiot go viral! - You're so arrogant! - I'm going to make him famous! - Get out of there! [Nel] You'll be famous! You'll be famous. Hey. [in Taglish] You can't miss my wedding. You're my best friend. [sighs] [in English] March 12. [in Taglish] I think I'll be busy that day. Work stuff. - [in Tagalog] Don't leave me hanging. - [both chuckle] [ballad playing over the radio indistinctly in Tagalog] - [Kit in English] Auntie Edith. - [Edith] Hi. [in Tagalog] Where's Grandpa? - [Kit] I'll just go home. - [Edith] He's inside. He was insisting on going to the cemetery. But I told him you were coming. - Have you eaten? - Not yet. - I made wing beans in coconut milk. - Perfect. - I'll just prepare your food. - OK. [camera clicks] [keyboard clicking] [Edith] OK. [Nel's grandpa] You're using your phone while eating? [chuckles] Grandpa, do you want to visit Grandma Rafaela tomorrow? Huh? Who's Rafaela? [Nel in Taglish] I don't know. I think he has Alzheimer's. But the doctor won't allow us to tell him. [in Taglish] Can't we sue him if he doesn't want to disclose vital information to the relatives? [in Tagalog] Hey! Are you listening? Yeah, of course. Ah... Let's get back on it some other day. Right now, let's just focus on my wedding. - [in Taglish] You're my maid of honor. - Wow! [laughs] Don't worry. You'll be the most handsome maid of honor ever to be in a wedding. - Don't flatter me too much. - [both giggle] - [vendor] Flowers? Sir, flowers? - [Nel in English] Thank you! [indistinct chatter] Here, Grandpa. - [cellphone dings] - [in English] Thank you. - [in Tagalog] Thank you, grandson. - [in English] You're welcome. HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MY LOVE... [indistinct chatter] [in Taglish] My love, happy birthday. Thank you. This is so wonderful. I'll make it up to you. Don't worry about it. [boy] Look! The valedictorian and the salutatorian are so sweet! [people cheering] [girl] I envy you guys! You're winning both in school and in love. What more can you ask for? [onlookers laughing and whooping] [Nel's grandpa talking indistinctly] [keyboard clicking] Nel! [in English] Hey, happy birthday! [in Tagalog] Thank you. I'm not having a party though. [in Taglish] By the way, I heard our reunion's going to be at the beach. [in Tagalog] That's right. - Who are you with? - Uh, Grandpa and Kit. I'll go ahead. See you on Saturday. Take care! - [man 1] Gather around! Selfie time! - [man 2] Let me join in. [all clamoring] - [people cheering] - [loud pop song playing] - [Nel] Grace isn't here yet? - Huh? [shouting over noise] You know, you're too excited. [woman] Cut it out. It's too loud. I don't want them to know she's the only reason... - [music stops] - [loudly]...why I'm here... [man] What did he say? [all teasing] Are we talking about Grace again? [in Taglish] Can't you move on already? What is this, first love never dies? - [all giggle] - [Nel in Tagalog] Cut it out! - [Grace] Hi, Kit! - [man] It's Grace! - [woman] Hi, Grace! - [Grace] Hi, Nel. There's the one you're looking for. - [Grace singing] ♪ Always a failure ♪ - You have an ugly voice... ♪ Always heartbroken ♪ ♪ It hurts so bad ♪ - ♪ To be so unlucky ♪ - [man] Grace, do you still love Nel? - Damn... - Nel's been looking for you. - ♪ I envy... ♪ - [Nel] Be quiet.

My wife's exhausted. - [Nel] Really? Asleep? - [man] Hey, wake up. [Nel] And suddenly she's up. We know where that is headed. Who knew the playboy would marry? [laughs] [in Taglish] Speaking of married couples, Nel and Grace are the only ones - who remain single here. - Oh! [in Tagalog] Why don't you two just get back together? You guys are giving me a headache! [man] Give it a shot! Nel, you didn't hear it from me. Now that Nel's had a few beers, let's put him to the test. When did you and Grace become a couple? - [in English] July 7, 2007... - July 4.5:25 p.m. [in Tagalog] Under the camachile tree behind our homeroom. [in Taglish] You were wearing green. I was wearing blue with a Masked Rider print. Your hair was in a ponytail, and you were biting your lips. [in Tagalog] Then you said to me, "We can be together, but…" Nel, we were just asking for the date. [laughter] [man] So, when was it? Grace must be talking about a different boyfriend. - [man] Shut up, dude. - Elmer, I think. We became official on July 4. She didn't want everyone to know yet because... she was worried her mother might get mad. Guys, that was a long time ago. [in Taglish] Guys, just to let you know, you're all invited to my wedding! - [people cheering, clapping] - [laughing] - [Kit in English] Thank you. - [woman] Thank you. - [in Taglish] Cheers to Kit! - [Kit] Thank you! - [acoustic guitar music] - [all congratulating] [Nel narrates message in English] [mouse clicks] [wistful music] [Grace narrates message] [in Taglish] What I did to you on our graduation was terrible. [in Tagalog] But it was a long time ago. [message alert] It's impossible for me to tell you to just forget about it. Because you never forget things. [in Taglish] But let's be friends again. [Kit in English] Yeah, sure, I'm basically done here. I'll just stay for a week. OK, I miss you. I love you. [in Taglish] I'm going back to Manila. Is that your parents? [Kit in Tagalog] Um... It's Ben. He's asking about you. Are you taking your souvenir or not? Hey, anyone could see you there! [in Taglish] You think you're still at Venice Beach? [in Tagalog] Why do you care? So, are you taking it or not? Give it to me. [in Taglish] Looks like you just picked it up at a convenience store. Whatever. It's stateside. Smell it. [in Tagalog] I don't smell anything. - So, you're going to stay here? - I'll drive back to Manila, too. [in Taglish] I'm still in vacation mode right now. And I might get some inspiration for the shop I'm designing. [in Taglish] So, how are you and Grace? - [yelps] - Hey! [Kit in Tagalog] Are you OK? Nel! - [Kit's voice echoing] Nel! - [young Kit] Hey, kid! Hey! Kid! - What? - Let's play this. [in Taglish] We can use this fence as the net. OK. - [Kit] Nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah, nyah. - [Nel] You cheater... Nel, what's your answer for number two? I'm doing something else. Nel, here are my dresses. Which do you think looks best on me? Isn't that what you wore last year? You always wear the same thing. No, what are you talking about? [romantic piano music] [chuckles] [camera clicks] [phone rings] [boss] Nel! Nel! Hey! So, what's your game plan? [in Taglish] You haven't uploaded anything yet in the "Today in History" section. I told you to submit your deliverables monthly. You should upload them one by one so it doesn't pile up. [in Taglish] You know that it still has to go to the graphics team, right? If you don't know any historical event that happened today, just Google one. Psst. [keyboard clicking] ARE YOU HERE IN MANILA? [in Taglish] Online, but you just seenzoned my message. Nice. You can just text me, you know. You millennials are so social media-dependent. So, you're not a millennial? Well, sadly I was born in that era, but I'm more of a Gen X. [Nel] OK, auntie. That's why you don't know about this new app feature. I just turned mine on. I have posts there that I don't remember. [in English] About someone who broke my heart. [in Taglish] I have a feeling it's Grace. The one in the throwback posts. [in Taglish] Nel, you have hyperthymesia. [in English] You can remember dates and details down to the very second of events. [in Taglish] You don't need that throwback feature. [in Tagalog] OK. Don't get angry with me. I just mentioned it to you. I have no intention of reading all of it. I clearly remember everything that's happened to me. [in Taglish] For your own peace of mind, deactivate that throwback feature. You don't need it. OK, auntie. [in Tagalog] By the way, Grace is here in Manila. [cellphone vibrating] [in Taglish] She's inviting us to her gig. Do you want to come? [in Tagalog] Um, OK. [in English] Um, hi, love. I'm working. [wistful music] [Nel in English] November 28, 2008. [in Taglish] Dear you. I have to make the most [in Taglish] of the last four months we'll be together. [in Taglish] Because after this, it is goodbye for us. [in Taglish] Are we still going to see each other? I hope so. I really hope so. [in Taglish] Shit. Who are you? [keyboard clicking] [man] Bro, why are we here on your date with your first love? You even brought all three of us along. We're not your chaperones. You still owe me that drink. April 9. Day of Valor coverage. May 13. You had me lying about your faux measles, but you really just went to Baguio for one week. - August 31. You made me a co-debtor... - [in Tagalog] OK, OK! Fine, I'll pay for our drinks. [in Taglish] Jeez, I just got held up tonight. Take a look at this. December 9, 2009. [in English] "I will never let you be my the one that got away." [in Tagalog] I used the term TOTGA before Katy Perry did. Were you and Grace still a couple in 2009? [man in English] Exactly my point, my baby. You know... [in Tagalog] Whoo! Someone's getting jealous. - Why would I get jealous? - Look at her. I'm not getting jealous! Shut up, assholes. - [man] Are you jealous? - I'm getting married. - She's here. - One more.

[in English] Happy monthsary, Nel. [in Tagalog] Elmer, I'll leave him to you. Enjoy yourself. [Elmer] Come on, man. [in Taglish] Do you know how to play eight-ball? You can take the solid balls. I'll take the stripes.

[in Tagalog] I wonder who you'll end up with. I don't know. I wonder, too. - You don't know? - No. Make a guess. - [Grace] You? - Good guess. [cellphone dings] [Nel in English] December 10, 2012. Dear you. You just told me the most painful words I have ever heard from a girl. [in Tagalog] You're so callous. [camera clicks] [Kit in Taglish]Grace texted me. She's looking for you. [in Tagalog] What will I tell her? [in Taglish] Don't reply. I'll just text her. [in Tagalog] Why? What happened? [in Taglish] You keep saying she's the one but you keep changing your mind. [Nel in Tagalog] We were so happy back then. [in Taglish] But she's not the one in the throwback posts. [in Taglish] You rely too much on that throwback app. [in Tagalog] What if Grace is the right girl for you? But you're letting her get away. [in Taglish] You told me she might be the one. [Nel] "Might be." I might also not be sure. [in Taglish] How about you? Are you sure about Ben? Yes, I'm sure. - [in Tagalog] What if he's the wrong guy? - What if he's not? What if you and Grace are meant to be? What if it was just us from the start? [in Taglish] I can't believe Grace and I have been together for two months already. [in Tagalog] Before, I was just hoping she'd be mine. Don't get jealous. [in Taglish] You'll still be the closest woman in my life. That sounds awkward. I promise, nothing will change. We'll always be best friends. I'll never leave you behind. I wish... that she'll never hurt you. [in Tagalog] That she'll take care of you. Like how you take care of me? [soft, romantic music] - [teasing noise] - [giggles] [in Tagalog] Hey, don't go to sleep on me. [in Taglish] I'm still awake. Do you want more beer? - [in Tagalog] Hey! Throw it properly. - [giggles] [Grace in Taglish] I understand. I saw it coming. [Nel in English] I'll never forget you. [Grace in Tagalog] Of course. [acoustic guitar music] [Grace sighs] [Grace in English] Good luck. [cellphone dings] [Nel] January 5, 2009. Dear You. [in Taglish] High school is almost over. I hope my feelings for you will also end. Can I ever move on from you? [wistful music] [cellphone ringing] [Edith in Tagalog] Your grandpa saw the candles from his wedding. He started crying. I'll take him to his doctor tomorrow. [RJ] Nel, aren't you feeling better yet? I'm not the patient. It's my grandpa. He's starting to forget about my grandma. We have the same condition. It's not reverse amnesia. But you're getting better. - Let's go, RJ. - Bye, Nel. - Get well soon. - Thanks. [boss in English] Marco here has filed his two weeks' notice. [in Taglish] This junior reporter is very hardworking. [Marco in Tagalog] You're making me blush. He works hard on flirting with other reporters. [in Taglish] Hey! Are you listening? You're too affected by his resignation. Nel gets emotional every time someone leaves. [Edmund] Hey, come on. Let's go. - Come on. - Hey. - [cellphone ringing] - [Nel's friends chatting indistinctly] Hold on. - Hello? - [Kit in English] Hello, Bunyi? - Guess what. - [in Taglish] I'm at work. What is it? [in Taglish] My wedding coordinator knows your ex-girlfriend Ces Jugeta. She's going to make my gown. Maybe she's the one you're looking for. - [in Tagalog] For real? - [in English] Yes. [in Tagalog] So, you want to meet her? - [in Tagalog] Kit. Where is she? - [Kit in English] Finally. [Kit in Taglish] What kind of a maid of honor are you? You're always late. [in English] Ces, he's here. There you are. The One-Punch Man bartender. Hi. How are you? - I'm good. - Good! [in Tagalog] Have you taken her measurements? [in Taglish] Kit, have you chosen a shade of color? [Nel in English] January 13, 2014. Dear you. [Nel narrating message] That was our viral photo in 2014. One-Punch Man at coffee shop. Oh, have a seat. Oh, no, it's OK. I can manage. This place hasn't changed at all, huh? [in Tagalog] Are you sure want to stay here? - [in English] Wanna bounce? - Can we, please? Sure. [in Taglish] Arnel Allan Bunyi? We're done reviewing your résumé. It's all right. We'll give you a call regarding your application. - [in English] Thank you. - [in Taglish] Thank you. [in English] So... How was it? [in Tagalog] I don't know. I'm nervous. But... I said all of the things you told me to say. - [in Taglish] It's so hard to be an adult. - [both chuckle] [in Taglish] You can do it. Soon enough, you'll be graduating. [in Tagalog] You can do it. [in Taglish] How did you answer, "Why do we have to hire you?" Um... [in English] "Because... Because you're hiring." - [in Tagalog] You told them that? - [giggles] [in Taglish] Just kidding. [in Tagalog] Of course, I told them what you told me. [giggles] Idiot. How much do you want to borrow? [in Taglish] I owe you a lot. Thank you. - [in Tagalog] Anytime. - [cellphone rings] [chuckles] Hi, Ben. Hi. [Giggling] How are you? [jazzy music] [man in English] Good morning, ma'am. - [Ces] Good morning. - [female staff] Morning. [Ces in Taglish] We're going to do the inventory later. [in English] OK. Good morning, Robert. [Ces in English] So, how are you? - I'm good. Super. - Mm-hmm? [in Taglish] How about you? You look gorgeous and successful. Not really. I just got to fulfill my promise to chase my dreams. - [in English] Ooh, humblebrag? - [giggles] [in Taglish] How about you? You look preppy and collected. Your fashion sense is a little outdated, but who cares nowadays, right? So, you're a fashion designer? - Yeah. - And you're based in Paris? [in English] Nice. And you? - You still work with Manila Bulletin? - Oh, yes. [in Taglish] Um, I'm now a senior reporter at the New Media department. [in English] It's good that you finally realized your dreams. [in Tagalog] I'm far from reaching them. [in English] Anyway, I'm still single. And I'm staying in Manila for good. [Nel sighs] - [in Taglish] Why aren't you in uniform? - Nel... Um... I'm resigning, actually. What? Why? I got a scholarship in Paris. Why didn't you tell me about it? I'm your boyfriend. Excuse me. What's taking so long? I'm in a hurry. Sir, please, we'll get back to you in a short while. [in English] Look, I was going to tell you. [in Taglish] And this has been my longtime plan. [in Tagalog] So, what? You're just going to leave me behind? [in Taglish] Excuse me. Can you please hurry up? [in Taglish] I told you, I'll get back to you shortly! Nel! [customers murmuring] [woman in English] Why did you get back with him? - [Ces] He's cute and he's nice. - [woman] He's not cute. - [Ces] Yes, he is. - [woman] Oh my God. - [in Tagalog] What did you see in him? - Shut up. He might hear you. - [in English] He's helping me move in. - [in Tagalog] Whatever. [in English] He's upstairs. My gosh, Ces. You're smart. You're obviously intelligent. You're successful, and hot guys are swooning over you. Why do you have to pick up the same trash again? I'm just giving ourselves a chance. Come on. I swear he must look like a sore loser right now. [sexy instrumental music] - Hi. - Hi! - Hi. - [in Tagalog] Step down from there. - I mean, have some snacks. - OK. [Ces] Let's eat. - [waitress in English] Your bill, sir. - Thank you. Oh, no, no. Let me pay for it. - [in Tagalog] No, I got this. - [in English] No, I insist. - [in Tagalog] I got this. - [in Taglish] Just use my card. I have a high credit limit. - [in English] I received your gold card. - Thank you. - You OK? - [laughs] Yeah. [Ces sighs] [Nel] OK, we're here. [Ces] Thank you. - Your keys. - Thank you. [Ces] Hey. I had fun tonight. Thank you. You're welcome. Did you have fun? Yes. Really? [Ces] OK, yep. See you there. Bye. Nel? Nel? Hey, wake up. Hey, I have to go to work. A new client wants me to design their clothing line. Here, dress up. Come on. [in Tagalog] I'll just wait for you here. [in Taglish] I can just order takeout. Are you having lunch here? [in Tagalog] You want something? Filipino? Thai? [laughs] Actually, no, sorry. I can't. [in Taglish] But you have to go, right? Don't you have work today? [in Tagalog] I do. But I can stay here. [chuckles] [in English] I really have to go. Sorry. [in Taglish] Please don't forget to lock up before you leave. OK? - [in English] Yeah. - [Ces] OK, bye. [sighs] [phone rings] [downbeat music] [in Tagalog] Nel. Nel! Have you read this? [in English] "Today in history." [boss reading message] "LOL." God! [in Taglish] We always run a fact-check here at the Manila Bulletin. So, what are we going to do now? Issue yet another erratum [in English] for a very minor section? God! [frustrated grunt] [Nel] Ces, I'm sorry. I don't even know why I'm surprised. I should have expected this from you. I gave you a chance, but you still... what? Disappointed me in the end? You have anything else to say? I'm so sorry. [scornful chuckle] You're sorry? I'm sorry I gave you another chance. Stop it. [somber music] [Nel in Tagalog] Doc. You know how to bring back memories, right? Will it take some time? Depends on the case. Who's the patient? - Me. - [in English] No way. You were diagnosed with hyperthymesia. [in Tagalog] What is it you don't remember? Many things. [in Taglish] So, can you help me? [in English] I'm sorry. I... I don't think I can help you. Anyway... [in Taglish] Thanks, Doc. [sighs] [Nel in English] January 28, 2015. Dear Arnel Allan. [in Tagalog] This is the day to forget all of the pain. [all laughing] - [man] Here we go. - [drums playing] - [man] Go, Leah! - [laughter] - [Leah] Come! Let's dance. - [man] Dance with her! There you go. [drumming continues] [laughing] - [man 1] Leah's great at dancing. - [man 2] Yeah. [Nel] You sure know how to do cultural dancing. [chuckles] [in Taglish] I really am a dancer. But I'm not indigenous. I'm just a mountaineer. I bet it's your first time up here. I brought wine. [in Tagalog] Want to grab a drink? Let's go! [giggles] [somber music] CAN I JOIN YOUR NEXT CLIMB? [Kit in English] I don't get you. I don't get this. I know. But she's too big for me. [Grace singing in the background] Bunyi. If you really want to be happy, take a chance. [in Taglish] Look, I'm sorry. I'm pestering you. [in English] You should be preparing for your wedding. [sighs] [in Tagalog] I don't know what to do with you anymore. [sighs] Kit! Why did you walk out on me? [in English] Come on, I just need a friend. [sighs] OK. What do you want me to do? [in Taglish] It's Leah. I found her. [sighs] [in English] Oh my gosh. [in Taglish] OK. But this will be the last time. - Yeah, last time. - OK. OK. [clinks] [chuckles] [Kit in Tagalog] You're paying for my gas. [Nel] Sure. [Kit] This is too far away. Let's take turns at the wheel. [in Taglish] Yes. I've borrowed 7,890 off you since you came back. [in Tagalog] And I will pay it all back when I get my salary. That is, if I get my paycheck. [Kit] This Leah is unbelievable. She had us driving all the way here for her? [Nel in Taglish] She's going hiking here. She messaged me last night. [Kit in Tagalog] She only invited you. You just dragged me along. [Nel in Taglish] Of course, we're best friends. [Kit in Tagalog] Are you sure Leah's here? [Nel] I'm sure of it. I called her up. - [Kit] What if she's not? - [Nel] You just have to trust me. [Kit in Taglish] So, if she's not here, we'll just go back, and that's it? [Nel] At least we enjoyed the view. [Kit in Tagalog] What if we get lost? - Can you still make it? - [Kit laughs] Of course. [laughs] I'm faster than you. [camera clicks] [Kit] Feeling cold? [Kit clears throat] [in Taglish] So, what now? You're going to check all the tents here? [in Tagalog] Why not? [in Taglish] You're impossible, Bunyi. [in Tagalog] I owe you a great deal. For what? For you. [sighs] [in Taglish] Sorry, I keep dragging you along. If only the person I'm talking about in those posts were here... [in Tagalog] Then it wouldn't be this difficult. [Kit in Taglish] So, what are you going to tell me? [in English] I met someone. [in Tagalog] Here we go again. How sure are you now? I feel it. Like with you. Huh? [in Taglish] I mean, like how it was when I first met you. I was so sure you would be my best friend. [in Tagalog] Really? Yes. Remember the first time we met, when I was lying down in our backyard and you shot the shuttlecock into my mouth? [in Taglish] You told me, "Let's play! Here's our net." [in Tagalog] What a memory. [in English] I know this time she gets me. She's my yin to my yang. She's the one. And I love her. [in Tagalog] Are you sure? I want you to meet her. [wistful music] [Kit sighs] [Nel sighs] [in English] Nel? I really have to go down. [in Taglish] I have a meeting with my caterer. [in English] And... Leah might have gone home. [in Taglish] I'm sorry. Just text her, OK? Kit, stay a little longer. I'm sure she's there somewhere. [Kit sighs] [in English] Nel, I really have to go. I'm sorry. [in Taglish] Kit, hold up! Come on! Is that how you treat your best friend? [in Tagalog] You'll leave me behind? [Kit] Wow. [in English] I almost did everything for you. [in Tagalog] I helped you find your girls, so don't make me feel bad. Go ahead, leave. You're happy. [in Taglish] You have a love life. So, who here is self-serving? It's not me. [scoffs] [in Tagalog] That's bullshit! I brought you here. In my own car. With my gas money. I took time off for you. What, so if you're unhappy, I have to be unhappy, too? [in Taglish] You're selfish, Nel! [in Tagalog] Then fine, go ahead! [in English] I might not see Leah now, but the next time you see me, I'm gonna be so damn happy! Go! [downbeat music] Kit! Nel? Nel! Leah? [Leah in Tagalog] I thought you were just kidding. [in Taglish] How are you going back? [Nel] I'll take the bus. - [in Tagalog] Kit left me... - [Leah] Come ride with me. [Nel in English] February 5, 2015. [in Taglish] Dear you. You're there. I'm here. [in English] But I know you are going to be there to meet me someday. [in Tagalog] But where is this all going? [downbeat music] [Leah] What's that? Throwback? Mm. [in Taglish] You know, that's all nonsense. And why deal with the past? [in Tagalog] Isn't now more important? [in Taglish] I just want to know. Who are these posts for? It's just weird that I don't remember anything [in English] on this day last year. And you're supposed to remember everything? Yes. Do you remember this? [laughs] - [in Tagalog] I feel so much better now. - [chuckles] [Nel] I don't care about the past... as long as I'm with someone who'll make me feel better. [Leah giggles] [Nel in English] February 5, 2017. [in Taglish] Dear you. I'm not afraid to leave the past behind. What's important is the present and the future with you. [in English] I am ready to make new memories. With you. With us. [hopeful instrumental music] [cellphone rings] - Hello? - [Edith] Hello, Nel. [in Tagalog] Your grandpa. He's gone. Come home. We need you here. [solemn music] Nel, Kit is not home yet. She needs to do something in Manila. But she said she'll join us for the burial. - [Leah in Taglish] My condolences. - Yes. Nel, my condolences. Are you OK? [in Tagalog] They're so unfair. [sniffles] They're so unfair. [sniffles] They all left me. Even Kit. [sniffles] It's painful for me... to keep all the memories, knowing those people are never coming back. - [Leah] Oh my God! - [tires screech, horn blares] - Hey! What's your problem? - What's yours, asshole! You're an asshole, too! - I'll make you famous! - What are you doing? - [in English] Just let it pass! - [in Tagalog] Knock it off! If Kit was here, she'd let me do this. Oh. OK. If that's the case, you'd rather be with Kit. [in English] OK, fine. Go find her. Good luck to you and your awful painful past! Leah. Leah! - [grunts] - [car horn blares] [man in Tagalog] You should ask her out on a date. - [Grace in Taglish] You miss her, right? - [Nel] Why would I miss her? [in Tagalog] Leah said our relationship wasn't deep yet. I'm not talking about her. Huh? You're so slow. You know who I'm talking about. Arnel Allan, I know you. Don't try to dodge your feelings. Try to remember. Who is she in your life? What does she mean to you? [Nel] Doc, help me out. [in Taglish] OK... But I just need to go to the admin center first. [in English] I'll be back in a few minutes. [in Taglish] Have a seat. Wait for me. - OK, Doc. - OK? [contents rattling] [unsettling music] [contents rattling] Doc? [in Tagalog] Doc? Why do I have this? [unsettling music intensifies] Nel! Doc, what's this? What's this? Doc, what's that? Tell me. - [in English] Relax, Nel. - Doc, what's that? - Calm down. - [in Tagalog] Doc, what's that? - [in English] Relax. - [in Tagalog] What's the meaning of this? [panting] Tell me the truth! Tell me the truth. What's the meaning of this? [in English] You want the truth? One year ago, a crying woman named Rafaela brought you to me. [in Taglish] Their doctor referred you to me. You were unresponsive. Your records showed that you're were in a coma because of trauma... brought on by an attempted suicide. [in English] The neurological injury caused by the compression of the neck could definitely affect his mental condition. [woman in Taglish] Doc, can you completely erase me from his memories? That isn't possible. [in English] But what I can do is to prolong a memory loss through electroconvulsive therapy. But one side effect is retrograde amnesia, which can be resulted by certain pain triggers. Removing the pain trigger will remove the memory. But this won't be a guarantee [in Taglish] because his memories might come back, [in English] especially with him who has hyperthymesia. Your grandparents signed the papers. The waivers. The confidentialities. [in Taglish] There was no assurance that you'd heal. So, they had all the triggers removed. [in English] I'm sorry, Nel. [Nel in English] November 28, 2008. Dear you. [in Taglish] I need to make the most of the last four months we're together. Because after this, it is goodbye for us. [in Tagalog] Will we see each other again? I hope so. I really hope so. [Nel, voice echoing] Hey, what are you doing there? [sniffling] Mama told me we're moving to the States after high school. [sniffles] [Nel in English] December 10, 2012. Dear you. You just told me the most painful words I have ever heard from a girl. - [Kit] Nel! - Kit. I have an offer to work abroad. I'll be with Ben. [in Taglish] Come on, let's celebrate. I'll pass. That's your success. [Kit] Hey! What's up with you? I thought we were best friends. You're miserable because you're selfish. [Nel in Tagalog] You're so callous. [in English] January 13, 2014. Dear you. I realize now that I'm nothing without you. BEN IS ALREADY YOUR BOYFRIEND? AND YOU EVEN BROUGHT HIM HERE TO THE PHILIPPINES?! [sobbing] [Kit in Tagalog] Nel, what happened to you? The customer was so arrogant. [in Taglish] If I hadn't seen your long post on your social media, I wouldn't even know. Why didn't you text me? You were a manager, but you threw it away? I never planned on being a barista all my life! Not when all of you became so successful after college. I excel in my studies but not in real life. [Kit] Where is Ces? I don't want her to see me like this. Are you busy? Let's have a drink. [Ces in English] Nel... Look, I'm sorry. [in Taglish] But what you did was wrong. [in Tagalog] You're so stubborn. [Ces in Taglish] Can we talk, Nel? [wistful piano music] [Nel in English] January 26, 2015. Dear you. [in Taglish] I'm so happy that I got promoted to Junior Reporter. [in Tagalog] The problem is, you don't even care. [in Taglish] That's just how it is when you're both building your dreams. [sobbing] WHERE ARE YOU? I'M ALREADY HERE. [sobbing] Kit! [in Tagalog] Kit, I know you're there. Let's talk. Kit, I know you're there. Let's talk, Kit. Kit! [groans] Kit. Kit! What? I thought you said the next time I saw you, you'd be happy. You don't look happy. [in English] Kit, now I know. [in Tagalog] I remember everything. What do you mean? Everything. All of it. [in Taglish] I know why things didn't work out between me and Grace. Or with Ces and Leah. [in English] Because there's a fourth girl I loved. [in Tagalog] Kit, it's you. [in English] Stop! - Stop. - [in Tagalog] Kit... I remember everything. You're the woman I've been talking about in my posts. [in English] Exactly. I was that girl. [in Tagalog] What do you mean? [in Taglish] In your posts. [in Tagalog] I already told you to stop trying to figure out who they were for. Why are you so stubborn? Kit, all my posts are for you. [exhales] [in English] How could I have been so blind all these years? [in Taglish] Aren't you wondering why you don't remember those posts? [in Tagalog] I don't care about that anymore. All I know is I love you. Kit, I just couldn't bring myself to admit my feelings. And I couldn't say how I felt towards you... because I was scared. I'm scared of being like all the rest. I don't want to lose our friendship. That's the thing, Nel. What are you talking about? [in English] I am your biggest heartbreak. [in Taglish] All your sad posts are meant for me. [in Tagalog] Why did we have to get to this point? [in Taglish] Don't you want to have only happy memories with me? [in English] What? [in Tagalog] Nel... We can't do this. [in English] I'm getting married. I'm in love with someone else. [in Tagalog] Kit, that's impossible. Are you going to throw away everything we've been through? No, I'm not. [sobbing] All those memories are important to me. All those memories... will stay in my heart. [in English] Nel, I care so much about you. And I want you to be with me forever. [in Tagalog] Then what's stopping you, Kit? Because... [in English] I don't love you. I... I don't love you... the way you want me to. [in Tagalog] You're important to me, Nel. [in English] I don't want to lose our friendship. So, please, just don't push it further. - Kit, I don't get it. - [in Tagalog] I don't want to hurt you. [in Taglish] That's why I went along with your mission. [in English] I helped you to find Ces, and Leah and Grace. I want you to be happy. So that when you're happy, you could be happy for me. [in Taglish] Happy with the fact that... I found the love of my life. [in English] And... it's Ben. So, do you think I'm happy now? I'm settled with this? I did what I had to do. You know what? [sniffles] I hate you. [sobbing] [man in Tagalog] Bro. Sorry we didn't tell you the truth. Bro, you all ganged up on me. - Kit loved you. That's why she did it. - Don't say it. [sniffles] Don't. [in Taglish] Bro, last year, when you found out Kit was getting married to her longtime boyfriend, [in Tagalog] you told her you loved her. [sobbing] [in Taglish] But she rejected you. [in Tagalog] Because she can't give you the love you want from her. Bro, Kit did everything to save your friendship. But she knows how you are when you're depressed. She didn't want you to sink into depression. [sobbing] Last year... COME HOME, NEL. GRANDMA'S GONE. ...we weren't able to stop you. [sobbing] [Kit] Nel? [intense musical buildup] Nel! [intense percussive music] Nel! [man] You were in a coma for a month. [rapid breathing] It was February. [in Taglish] All your best friend could do was cry her eyes out. Because she didn't want to lose you. She didn't want to lose you. Nel, what kind of blunder did you make now? [Doc in Taglish] So, you want to totally erase Kit from your memories? [in English] Are you sure about this? If I erase them, you can never get them back.

Kit, please say something. [sobbing] What do I need to do? I don't want to die again. I didn't gain anything from it. [sobs] You don't have to do it again. [sobs] [in English] Pick yourself up. Stand up. Move on. [in Tagalog] But I love you. I love you so much. [in English] I can't love you back. [in English] I have done so much for you, Nel. But you're so stubborn.

[instrumental music] [in Taglish] We're going to miss you here at the Manila Bulletin. [chuckles] [in Tagalog] But I still owe you that drink. You want it? Piss off. [all chuckle] [woman in Taglish] Hey! Can I share this table with you? - [in English] Go ahead. - Thank you. [clanking] [woman] Mm! [sighs happily] [in Taglish] Sorry, I'm such a noisy eater. I'm so hungry. [chuckles] [upbeat instrumental music] [phone vibrates] [laughing] Sorry, this is so funny! I'm Sue, by the way. - [in English] I'm Nel. - [in Tagalog] I know. - What? - [in Taglish] I'm one of your followers. Someone has a crush on me. [laughs] [in English] Hey, I'm so glad I met you. And I'm so glad you found me. [Giggles] [in Taglish] I'm just kidding. Jeez, Nel. You can get attached so easily. - Wow. - [in Tagalog] I just got here. Am I just that charming? - Wow. - [giggles] [romantic instrumental music] Love... [chuckles] What are you doing here? You shouldn't be here. [in Taglish] You're way too excited. That's right, I'm too excited. [in Tagalog] Don't look at me yet. You might jinx our wedding. [chuckles] I thought it was something important. [camera clicks] [acoustic guitar music] I love you. I love you very, very much. Go back to your room. Get ready. [in Taglish] See you later. I love you.
