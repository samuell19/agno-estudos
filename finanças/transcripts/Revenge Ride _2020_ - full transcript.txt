I barely even talk to them. - Huh. - Where are you from? - I am from the other side of the river. - Me too. - Really? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - Well, you know that saying, do something that scares you everyday? - Yeah, yeah, I do. - So you're a freshman? - Yeah. Off to a great start. I take it you didn't do the whole college thing. - I never needed to. Worked at my dad's bike shop when I was a kid, I always had a job. - My first job was at a froyo stand. - Nothin' wrong with that. Fuckin' love froyo. - So did I. - Gettin' behind the curtain ruin it for you? - Creeper of a boss. - Same shit at the bike shop. - No way, people gave you shit? - I wasn't always like this. My daddy used to hire these guys to come in during the summer to help him out. They were relentless. But I took care of them. Once my dad was gone, shop was mine. - Did he pass away? - Moved to Florida. - So you own a bike shop, that's how all this started? - You mean the gang? Kinda. Some girls came to me in a tough spot. Needed some help. We're a bunch of bitches with some shit in common. - What's that? - Same shit you have in common with us now. - So you go where you're needed. - Something like that. - You're like superheroes. - We're pretty fuckin' far from heroes. - You enjoy football? - I guess, first year, this point I'm just doin' it for the scholarship, you know? - Oh, what, you don't wanna be in crippling debt like the rest of us? - Listen, I have my whole life to be in crippling debt. I'm a lit major. - You look a little old to be a freshman. - Yeah, there might have been a gap year, or two. Mom got sick so, had to take care of her. - Wait until she got better and then... - No. - Oh, I'm... Shit, I'm sorry, I... - It's fine, it's fine. - Actually, the same thing happened to me when I was 15. And then I found these girls and now, they're my family. - Well, least you have someone. - I mean, you have these amazing, amazing fellas, they're just Oh, yes, yeah, yeah, frat stars. - Keepers. Too fabulous. Yeah, no thanks. - Are you sure, 'cause we can go... - I'm positive, I am... - Sing, and, hey. - Hey, we're gonna really get the party started, you're ready to party, right? - Yeah... - We will be ready. - All right. That is for you. - Thank you. - We got some horny ones tonight, huh? Fuck yeah. - I gotta go. - What? She just, spot the good stuff. - I just think it's a better idea that you go right now. This is my number... - Are you, are you kidding me? - No, not at all, you should call me. - Okay. - Let's get this after party started! Hell yeah! Let's get 'em, bitches! - Down the hatch! - Where's our fourth one at? - He had nothing to do with it, I checked. - It's not your call to make. - Trig, I checked, he had absolutely nothing to do with it. - It's still not your call, babe. Mary, come here. Should be you. You should have the honor of kickin' this thing off, come on. - I just pull the trigger? - You just pull that trigger, and we'll handle the rest. - What the fuck? - That's fuckin' right! - Get down there, come on. - Stay the fuck down, you whore! - What the fuck? Fuck. - Get here, fuck, gonna get it on. - What the fuck... - Shut your fuckin' mouth, cum stain! - Cum stain. - Fuck. - Get here, fuck, gonna get it on. - You fuckin' pieces of shit should consider yourselves real fuckin' lucky. - What the fuck? - Keep your mouth shut. - 'Cause I mighta just killed ya. You have the one that you victimized to thank for that. Yeah, it's all coming back to you now, huh? - Look, look, I don't know what she told... - See, our girls here don't really like bullshit. So you better keep your fuckin' mouth shut. - What the fuck is goin' on? - Maybe it's better this way though. Maybe this way you'll have something to remember. Next time you see a girl at one of your lame-ass parties or in a bar, that you think is weak, well, you'll remember tonight. You'll remember the pain. In the spirit of generosity, I'm gonna give you guys a little head start. Five seconds oughta do it. Four, three, two. You boys thought you were gonna have some fun tonight, huh? - You're fuckin' crazy! You got that right! - What the fuck? - This one's all yours, Mary.

Gotta get the fourth one too, right? - Trigg, we got 'em, why are we going back? - Come on. - Mary, so what'd you think of your first ride? - She liked it, didn't you, Mary? - I fuckin' loved it. - How'd it make you feel? - Great. - Nah, come on, I want more than that. How'd it really fuckin' make you feel? - It made me feel amazing. It made me feel right! - Yeah? - Like I'm done putting up with their shit. - That's more like it, what shit? - "Don't wear that, Mary, you'll look like a slut!" "Don't be a prude, Mary." "Oh, it's just a phase, Mary." "Smile, smile, smile!" - Who are you fucking done with? - All of them, every last one of these assholes! The pickup lines, the ass grabs! - Fuck that! - Fuck that! - What are you gonna do about it? - They wanna hurt me? I'd like to see them try. I'm gonna make them bleed! - What do we say to that, Dark Moon? - Fuck yeah! - Yeah, that's fuckin' right! You want in? - Fuck, yeah. - You know what that means, ladies. - Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary! Mary, Mary! Mary, Mary, Mary! Oh my god. - Get the fuck up, get the fuck up. - Guys, guys, all right, show's over, everybody back to class now, goddammit. I hope that's the last time I have to make you fuckers run after practice. What the hell's wrong with you? - Well, we had a long night last night, Coach. You know how it goes. - Yeah, I know how it goes. I never let it get in the way of my game and I expect the same outta you. - Yes, sir. - What was that? - I said, yes, sir, Coach. - Good, 'cause we're tryin' to win a fuckin' championship and if you guys fuck it up for the rest of the team, you're gonna pay. - Fuckin' burn! - Think mine's infected. I need to see a doctor. - Yeah? And have everybody read Suck My Pussy on your ass? Fuck! All from that stupid little bitch at that party. Wasn't even a good fuck. - Waste of a goddamn pill is what it was. - Well, it coulda been worse. She coulda turned us in. - Fuck that, "Coulda been worse." No, I wanna make somebody pay for this shit. - I don't think that's a good idea, man. - What, you scared of some cunts on two wheels? - I'm not scared of shit. - Good, 'cause those bitches don't know what's coming to 'em. Let's go. - Your call has been forwarded... - You nervous? - Yeah. I didn't think those assholes were ever gonna get what was coming to them. - Sure we'd get 'em. - Is this what you did? When, you know. - No. By the time I met these girls, he was... He was long gone. You know, you don't have to do anything you don't wanna do, right? - You ready to join our family? - Yes. - The same leather vest. This will be your cut. It's a symbol of what we are. What we mean to each other. Anyone wearing this cut is one of your sisters. And you're one of theirs. You understand? - Yes. - This cut will become part of who you are. Your identity from this point on. You can forget about your old family 'cause we are your sisters now! You forget about your old school. We're your education now. Through thick and thin. You're one of us. So it's time to leave the old you behind. Who are we? - Dark Moon! - Who are we? - Dark Moon! - All right! - Dark Moon, Dark Moon, Dark Moon, Dark Moon! - Hey, Brian, it's Maggie from Monty's.

Quite the tough guy, huh? - Whoa, hey, I never claimed to be the tough guy. - That's true. - This place is amazing, though. - Yeah, this is where I come to just kinda, like veg out, you know? - Yeah. Have you been coming here for a long time? - Since I was a kid. Real young, when my mom was sick. I mean, life changed after that and, I just always, I came up here. And then Trigga took me in. She didn't care who I was or where I came from. - Sometimes it's all you need, you know? Someone that makes you feel special and just changes your whole outlook on life, you know? Look, Maggie, there's something I need to tell you. - No, we can talk about that later. 'Cause right now I'm gonna get you really fucked up. - Really? - 'Cause I am talking out of this world, just Okay? - Okay, okay, and how do you plan on getting me there? Wow. - Yeah.

Hey, I'll stop if you don't feel comfortable. - No, I want to. - You sure? - Yeah. - So, I've been doing a lot of thinking. I think this place might beat the bar. It better fucking beat the bar. - Look, there's something I need to tell you, that I was trying to tell you before. I kinda followed you guys to the quarry the other night. - What do you mean you kinda followed us? How the hell do you kind of follow someone? - I mean, I didn't mean to. I mean, I meant to, I just didn't know that you guys were... - Were beating the shit out of your friends? - They're not my friends. I know why you guys did what you did. You knew what happened? - No, no, no, I... - You actually knew? - No, I just, I just found out. I didn't know about it before. That's why I called you. I didn't know. Look, what I'm trying to say is I know why you guys did what you did, you're right, okay? I saw Mary that night, and she was drunk. I tried to help her, I asked if she needed help. I never thought that they were gonna... You gave those assholes what they deserved. Keegan wants payback. - Look, I don't want you getting caught up in this. - I just don't want you to get hurt. - So, I'll see you tomorrow? - I mean, if you're lucky, maybe. - Can't wait. - Yo, Brian? We're going out to Monty's tonight for a few drinks. You know, find a few bitches. You wanna come? - No, man, uh... Gotta stay in and study. - You got a little time to come out and play, don't you? - Suit yourself, pussy. - I just wanna let you know that we do take these allegations very, very seriously. But what you're saying is hearsay, it's conjecture. You say you saw some pill bottles. How do you know it wasn't Advil? - It was not Advil. - That's what you say though, that's your opinion. - Sorry I'm late, what'd I miss? - Absolutely nothing, we're actually just wrapping up right now, so... - These guys did it, all right? They drugged a girl and they raped her. You're just gonna let them get away with it? - You know what, I resent that implication, son. You better watch yourself. Look, I believe that you think that you actually saw something. You know, a bottle... - I don't believe it... - Don't fuckin' interrupt him. - But here's the thing, Mr. Cattrel, no one has stepped forward, there's been no victim. There's nothing here, okay? - If there's no case, then why is he here? - You have no case. - This is the clutch. - Yes. - This is the throttle. - Yes, right. - And this is the brake. - Yeah, but that's just the front brake 'cause the back brake's down there, opposite side from the gear change lever, right? - Fuck. - What? - How do you remember all this stuff? - You'll get it, trust me. - Man, I really love it here. - Yeah. So, where were we? - You were gonna let me ride it out. - Really? - Uh-huh. - Was I? - Mm-hm. All right. - Hey. - Hey. Looks like you guys were havin' some fun. - Yeah, I am. Your cousin's lovin' it. - I'm sure she is. - Wait till we get those fuckers right, right? - We got 'em, Trig, we're good. - When'd you get a fucking conscience? There's no mercy for those fuckers, you forget that? - I'm getting real fuckin' tired of havin' to keep meeting you guys after practice. I got called to the fucking president's office and your names came up. - What are you talking about, Coach? - You're too fuckin' dumb to play stupid with me. You guys had some fun with a drunk freshman and now somebody's pissed off. - Look, Coach, what you gotta understand about that bitch is... - Save it, I already took care of it. But that's not what I'd be worried about if I were you fuckers. You got somebody talkin' and I think you know exactly who it is. - We'll handle it. - See that you do. - Coach, we're good on this though, right? With the girl? - Yeah, you're good. I just told 'em how you boys were dedicated to football. - Thanks, Coach, we owe you. - Damn right you do, I'm not saying you little fuckwads can't have fun. But be a little bit more fuckin' discrete next time. Guys? - Havin' some trouble? - Yeah, dude, my keys don't work. - Well, that's because this house is for football players. Gotta be a football player to live here. See, we all thought you were on our team, but we all trust each other, got each other's backs. You know, on and off the field. So we don't have any room on this team for anyone we don't trust. Ain't that right, boys? - Sure is. - Look, dude, I have no idea what's goin' on. - Why don't we help him get his stuff packed up? We'll give him a nice, big farewell. - Oh, yeah? - Mm-hm. See, fellas, Brian here's got his own little biker bitch. Is that why you tried to snitch on us, huh? You stickin' it to this cunt? Or is she givin' it to you? - What'd you say, you fuckin' snitch? Hey. Now, we can't understand you. Pussy. - Hey, look up. If you ever try to pull that shit on us again, I will end you. And you can tell those cunts we're coming for them too. - Dude, what the fuck? - Oh my god, Brian. You okay? Oh my god, gimme that. - Listen to me, listen to me, those guys do not give a fuck about what those idiots did to me... - They did this to you? They fucking did this... - Ahh, fuck, fuck, fuck, listen to me, listen to me, listen to me. Keegan is coming for you. I don't know what he's planning. He's planning something big, okay? - He can't be here. - He's hurt, okay, we have to fucking help him. - He can't stay here. - Where is he supposed to go? - That is not our problem. - This happened to him because he was trying to help! - And you are puttin' us all in danger by keeping him here. - Danger? He can barely fucking breathe! - He was trying to help me. - We don't fuckin' know that. We don't know he's not fuckin' lyin'. - What the fuck is your problem? - You don't fucking remember what they did to her? - They did to her, not him, he had nothing to do with this! - He's not so fuckin' different. None of 'em are. - Oh my god, you actually believe that, don't you? It's us against the whole goddamn world? - Fuck has the world ever done for us, huh? - I didn't sign on for a war with the world. - You ride with your sisters! - And I will fucking die with them! But I am not getting dragged down your goddamn rabbit hole, Trig. I love you, Trig, and you know that. But this anger, this hate, you gotta get a handle on it, not just for us, but for you. - We don't fucking... - Trig! Don't you fucking touch him. - Now we know where your fucking loyalty is. Get the fuck outta here, take him with you. - Trig. Fine, come on. - There she is, right there. We'll come back here tomorrow night, and we'll fuck them up. Maggie. Maggie. - Fuck! It's just, I've never seen her this mad before, ever. I mean, she's not fucking calm, but this is war to her, okay? This is fucking war. People are gonna get hurt. - I know, and this is not something we can control anymore, Maggie, let's just... - What are you talking about? - The only way we stand a chance is if we leave town. - I can't. - This is not your fight anymore. All this hate, it's just gonna get everyone killed. - Brian, this is my family. - I just don't want you to get hurt. There's no winning here. Trigga's gonna take you and the whole gang down. I'm not gonna let that happen. I care about you too much. Let's just leave, please, let's just leave. - I don't know, man. - Make me feel lucky. Lucky to have you. - I'm worried about you. - Me, why? - I'm scared all of this has gone too far. - Us? - No. This fight, these guys. Why can't we just let it go? - 'Cause it's more complicated than that. - I know what you've all done for me and I'm so grateful. But is this where you wanna be? With all this violence? You love Maggie so much and you both are so close. But you're letting this fight ruin that. And I can't let you do that for me. - Well, it's not all for you. It's for all of us. Forever we get told what we can or we can't do. Forever we get raped and we're told it's our fault. I'm done with it. We gotta stand up and say enough is enough. - Fuck, dude, like, I don't think this is a good idea. - You can come with us or not. But if you don't, once I clean up those sluts, you're next. - Please, no... Off me. No! - Suck my dick, bitch. - No! - Fuck, yeah! - No! No, no! - Keegan! - Get up! - Chad! - Come on! - Let's get outta here. - Let's get the fuck outta here. - They fucking killed her. I'm gonna kill 'em. Are you fucking with me or are you with them? - I will ride with you, I will fight with you. And I will fucking die with you. I'm with you. - Gimme that. "This ends tonight, the quarry, midnight." - Fuck, man, fuck. Did I miss the fucking joke here? - This ends tonight. Those bitches aren't going to the police. They're serving themselves up to us. - I don't know, I don't think this is a good idea, man. - You wanna go to jail over that slut, huh? We end this tonight and we're in the clear. As long as they're alive, we are fucked. Let's go. Fuck this shit. - Hey, uh, hey, Brian, it's me. I wanted to say... Thank you. Yeah, just, just thank you. And... - Come on, pick up. - You all ready to die? Like your stupid bitch of a friend? - You son of a bitch. - Hey! - You son of a bitch. You son of a bitch. - Maggie, you okay? Let's get outta here, come on. Come on, one, two, let's go. Look at me, you're okay. - Brian? Brian? Brian? - Trigga, we don't have to do this. - Shut the fuck up. - Trigga, stay, Trig, no! He had nothing to do with this. Trig, he had nothing to do with this. Trig, no, please, he had nothing to do with this! Trig, please! - This is for Mary. - Trig, please don't do this, no! Trig! Trig!
