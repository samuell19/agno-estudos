(foreboding music) - I've told you many times, Melissa, stop playing with your food! Can't you eat like a human being, without making all of those disgusting sounds? Do you understand me? - Yes, daddy, I understand, I won't do it again. - Melissa, stop it! Are you making fun of me? You think I'm some kind of an idiot? You think I'm that stupid? Do you? - It's not my fault that mommy's gone! It was you, it was you all the time! - Why are you saying this to me? - Because the truth, we all ought to admit it! It's because of you! She was never happy, she cried all the time. And you were never with her, with us, were you? It's your fault, it's all your fault! - You're just repeating what you've heard her say, aren't you? But do you really believe what you're telling me? Do you? - Daddy, please, you're hurting me. - You're a little witch, aren't you? Ever since she left, you've been teasing me. And I've had enough! You're in a lot of trouble now, my little one. I'm gonna teach you a lesson you'll never forget. - Let me go! - No, I won't! - Daddy, please, leave me alone! - No! Ow! Come here, you little whore. Come here! Where do u think you could hide, Melissa? I'd find you anywhere in this town. Come with me, my precious. Come, into the darkness. Come, into the darkness. I know you're afraid of the dark, I saw you crying a few nights ago when you couldn't find the light switch. - No, it's untrue, I couldn't find Annie! - You mean this? - How did you know? - It's a little secret between Annie and me. "Oh, daddy, help me, he's here. "He's gonna take me away, please help me! "It's Hellinger, daddy, daddy, help me, help me. "He's coming to take me away, help me, Hellinger is here!" You know you're afraid of him. You've been a bad girl, you're afraid he's going to take you away. - No, he doesn't exist, mommy said he's a lie, just like everything else you said to her! - Oh, no, he's real, Hellinger is the man with the black eyes on his eternal search for damned souls, to take to hell with him. He especially likes little girls that don't listen to their daddies! You don't want to be the next victim, do you? He'd love to pluck out your eyes and watch the blood drip all over your pretty little clothes. He'd love to kidnap you, and then kill you! - Daddy, you're hurting me! (dramatic music) Daddy, look! (Hellinger roars) (Hellinger roars) - Why are you crying, my darling one? You wanted him dead, didn't you? And now your dreams are your reality. And your reality has set me free! And this is my thanks to you, my darling. But do not worry, because I will be back! (Melissa screams) (wind blowing) (creepy music) - Detective Lonegan. - What's up, how are you? - Crime scene unit just finished up. - They come up with anything interesting? - Nothing, for now, unfortunately. But they don't think this is a robbery gone bad. I mean, look what they did to him. - They? Why did you say they? - Crime scene unit said they found footprints from three to five people. What was strange is, they didn't take any money. They grabbed his shirt from his other pocket, ripping it. I don't know, drugs, maybe? - My god, what a shitty day. (dramatic music) - Hold on, after that, that man, the one your father called Hellinger. Has his soul, with some sort of a limbo looking for a place to rest, just vanished into the darkness? Is that what you're saying, Melissa? - Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That's what I've been trying to tell you for the last 100 times. Won't you listen to me? After about a half an hour, the police broke in. I think they were called by the neighbors. They found me covered in blood, head to toe, over his body. They closed the case, saying that some kind of a maniac came in through the open window, killed in a homicidal ruckus, then went out the same window he came in. They said I'm lucky I'm alive. Real lucky. Then the detective unit that was on the case checked on my mother, well, I'd hunted her down. And, for some time, I went to go live with her, and her new husband, in Nevada. But I didn't like him very much, so, when I was 16, I got my shit together. And I came to New York City. - Melissa, I already know about this. What I want to know about is, do you still think he's a real person, someone that actually exists? You think your father was killed by some sort of a monster? Is that what you think, Melissa? - [Melissa] Yes, do you even wanna know why? - [Doctor] I'd like to know, please tell me. - Because I saw him the other night. - [Laura] Want some chamomile tea, miss? Melissa? - No, no, I'm good, thanks. - Suit yourself, good night. - Good night. (dramatic music) Shit, not now. Laura has a flashlight around here, somewhere. Where are my goddamn slippers? (gasps) (dramatic music) - Are you searching for me, Melissa? You still love me after all these years, don't you? - Please. (creepy music) No! No, no! Stop! Please, no. - How I've missed you, my precious. I've missed you more than God! But the light, the lights! Too much light has kept us apart! Darkness is good. - Please, please go away. - My, you've become such a beautiful girl. (foreboding music) Your eyes, I'd really like to have those lovely little eyes. - No, no! - How I wish they were mine! I want to rip them out! (Melissa screams) - [Laura] Melissa! Melissa! Melissa! Melissa, Melissa, Melissa, you're okay. (Melissa sobs) Jesus Christ, not again. - [Melissa] So, that's what happened. What do you think, doc, is there a psychologist around here? - Well, honestly, Melissa, I'm still not comfortable with your obsession with the dark. See, if it was just an ordinary childhood phobia, that would be something that would be relatively easy to cure. But, what you're telling me is that he is the dark. - [Mary Beth] Excuse me, Dr. Wallis? - Yes, I know, Mary Beth, the time's up. - Yes, and the Hoffmans are here, and they're waiting for you in your office. - [Doctor] Okay, fine, why don't you get them a cup of coffee, and just tell them I'll be with them in a few minutes, all right? - Okay, no problem. - [Doctor] Thanks. Now, where were we? - [Melissa] That's okay, Dr. Wallis. Next Thursday it is. - Well, sure, yeah, thanks. Be well, Melissa, be well. - I'm gonna try, Dr. Willis. - Come with me, he's waiting for you. - As if I care about him. Why don't you do me a favor, Bob, and go fuck yourself? - I said, the Reverend's waiting for you. Don't make him wait any longer. Making a spectacle, here, you want me to drag ya? - You know, you are a real pain in the ass, Bob. - [Reverend] Would ya like a drink, Melissa? Soft drink, perhaps, or some lemonade? - You've nearly kidnapped me to buy me lemonade? Is this your way to court girls, Reverend? Or do you think I'm as stupid as the people who would buy the videotapes of your sermons? - Obviously not, my dear. And knowing you're gonna be your father's daughter, I suppose you think you're too clever to listen to the humble advice of a poor man of the Lord. So, I'll make it brief: there's a new gathering tonight, and I would very much like for you to be there. You know the place, and even Roger will be there. It's at ten o'clock sharp, so please come. - Open up, dickhead. - [Bob] Watch your mouth when you're talking to him. Or next time, snap your neck, understood? - Jeez, Bob, I didn't know the marriage between you and Greg was goin' so bad. So why don't you stop the fucking limo, so I can get out and mind my own goddamn business? - You little ... - Catch this, dickhead. - Stop this, Bob, stop this, stop this immediately. - As you wish, Reverend. - And Greg, do as she says, park. Park the car right here. - You heard him, stop it. - [Greg] Yes, sir. - Melissa, what do you say to what we were just talking about? - Oh, that's great, Reverend. Now, where the fuck am I? - [Detective Lonegan] What do I gotta do for a coffee and a couple of donuts, around here? Call the mayor? - [Sal] I don't know what to tell you, Detective Lonegan, I couldn't find coffee. And that Detective Kavich ate all the donuts again. Somebody should talk to this guy, I mean, enough is enough, already, the guy is a horse! - [Detective Lonegan] Guy's a gluttonous bastard. - Eh, what's the use, I guess I'll go out for the coffees. - Great, you want something, Ken? - No, thank you. - Thanks, Sal. - All right, I'll be back in a minute with the coffees. - Okay, great. You want one of these? - No. - You sure? Mm, you don't smoke? - Only after I get laid. - You don't spend much on tobacco, then, do you? Couple of bucks a year? - [Kendall] (laughs) Very good. That's not why you called me down here, is it? - Nah. This morning, about 1:35 AM, we find the body of a man with his chest torn open, and his eyes ripped out. First, they think, maybe a robbery gone bad. But his money's still in his pockets. Not to mention the horrifying way in which he was killed. Hope there's not a new psycho killer loose in the city. - Did you ID the victim yet? - Mm, yeah, about an hour ago. We get current information that he was, in life, Brian Walpole, Wall Street broker. What he was doing down in Brooklyn still remains a mystery to us. - That's why you called me, huh? - Exactly. In this envelope is everything you'll need, Ken. Do a good job and the police will be grateful to you. - Well, if I have to break a few bones in this one, that okay with you? - That's fine, but please, try not to break any of the wrong ones, okay? - No problem. - Page me as soon as you get some news, and good luck. - Thank you. - Oh, give my regards to your cousin, Mel something, right? - Her name is Melissa. - Of course, Melissa, nobody's perfect, eh? Good luck, be careful. - [Kendall] I know. - So what, you go to Colombia for this coffee? (Sal sighs) (calm music) - [Laura] Okay, so, what are you gonna do, are you gonna go to this scam-fest, or not? - I don't know, I really don't know. - You might see Roger, though. Have the two of you finally broken up? - No. But I was tempted to, he was such an asshole on Wednesday. God, I wanted to slap him. Besides treating you like shit, he treated me like I was a whore, and he was my pimp, or something. You know, I don't give a shit if he is the right hand of the Reverend, or not. I don't care if he licks his ass, night and day. I am not his, I am not theirs, I am not anybody's. Period, that's it. - I'm on your side, you go, girl. (Melissa laughs) - So, are you gonna go, or not? - Yeah. (laughs) But I'm gonna take my cousin with me, you know? Kendall will know what to do if something happens. Ha-ta, they won't even know what hit 'em. - Oh, Kendall, I remember him from the gym, that time he gave the free, what, street fighting demonstration? He's a really good martial artist. - Mm-Hmm. - Wonder if he's good at any other sports? - Oh, god, Laura, you're making me sick, he's my cousin. - Oh, for Christ's sake, I mean, come on. Is there some law that says you can't sleep with your best friend's cousin? - No, but there's laws against some of the shit that he's into. - Oh, what's he gonna do, he's gonna make me call him daddy? - (laughs) You watch too many drama films. - [Laura] Oh, come on, don't be such a tight-ass. I'm only joking. Seriously, though, if Kendall does go tonight, there's gonna be some serious shit. You know how much the good Reverend and his entourage would like to have him crucified. Kendall doesn't really like them, either. - I know, I know that. But if anything does happen, I just wanna, I wanna make sure I have some sort of security, you know? (cool rock music) - Hi, gorgeous. - You lookin' for something? You lookin' for something in particular? Something ilke me? - Well, to be honest, yes, but no. - Well, I do something real good, I wanna show you. Come with me. - No thank you, I just want some information about something. - Man, who are you, Vice Squad, or something? Are you gonna arrest me? - No way, can I ask you a few questions about something? - The fuck you think we are, information, 911? - Charlie's fuckin' angels, here's Farrah. - All I wanna know is if you saw somethin', about 1:30 in the morning. - Oh, I see what this is about. You think we're stupid or something? Trying to get us in trouble? - Listen, there was a murder on this block this morning, okay? I just wanna know if you girls saw anything, that's all. - We didn't see nothin'. - Listen, we're tryin' to work, get out of here, asshole. - All right, maybe there's something you don't want to tell me about. - You don't leave, we're gonna call Nikky, all right? - [Blonde Woman] Nikky! - Nicky! - [Blonde Woman] Nikky! - Nik! - [Nikky] Yeah, what the fuck is goin' on? What the fuck is your problem, man? What, you don't wanna screw my girls? What, are you a fuckin' homo? - Fuckin' faggot. - You don't wanna fuck anybody, what the fuck are you doin' here, what the fuck do you want? - Fuckin' lookin' for trouble, that's what he's doin'. - Oh, yeah? You've come to the right person, asshole. - Look man, I ain't lookin' for no trouble, okay? I just wanna ask you a couple of questions, that's all. - Yeah, well, what kind of fuckin' questions? - [Kendall] Well, how 'bout this? Last night, about 1:30 in the mornin', a Wall Street broker gets murdered on this block. Gets his throat cut, and his eyes ripped out of his fuckin' head. But, since this is your block, I guess you already know about that, right? - Yeah, I heard about it, that's some pretty nasty shit. Look, let's get something straight. I don't like it when shit like that happens on my block. It brings down the heat, it fucks up the status quo. But let's get back to us. I don't know who the fuck you think you are, and I don't give a fuck, either. All I know is, I was winnin' $50 shootin' craps, 'til you came along and broke up the gang. Ask anyone, I've killed for less. Because you're smart enough to tell me what you asked my girls, I'm not gonna kill you. But I gotta at least throw you a beat, come on. - Status quo, right? - Exactly, gotta at least throw you a beat, or I lose respect on the street, nothin' personal. (rock music) - [Kendall] You know something, you fuckin' punk? You talk too much! - Just fuck off of me, get out of my way! Blow the fuck up, I'll cut your eyes out, you cocksucker, don't ever come down here again, motherfucker! Here I got something for you! And you, what the fuck are you guys doin'? Get down here and make some fuckin' money! Do you see what I gotta put up with around here, to take care of you bitches, goddammit? You better get the fuck out of here! Go, what are you lookin' at? - Oh, my dear, good Roger, aren't you even a little bit excited about our new gathering for tonight? - Well, yes, of course, Reverend, as usual. I think it's a great opportunity for the ones who haven't heard your word about our Lord, who art in Heaven, and who guides us on our sacred mission, between the land of humanity lost, to the guilty pleasures of the flesh, and the sins and corruption of money-making. - Very good, Roger, very good. Why, I couldn't have done it any better, myself. You really are my best boy, Roger. Bob, Rob, is everything all set? - Yes, Reverend, everything is fine. - You can go now, thank you. - [Bob] As you wish, Reverend. - Roger, didn't you have something for me? - Yes, of course, Reverend. (creepy music) - Fine, fine. I'll watch it later. Isn't it a little bit hot in here? (Roger sighs) - [Kendall] Hey, Dave. - [Detective Lonegan] What's up, Ken? Almost gave up waitin' for ya. - [Teresa] Ken! - [Kendall] Oh, it's cold out here, huh? - [Teresa] Hi, I thought that was you. - [Kendall] Hey, what's goin' on? - [Teresa] Hi. You lose something in my bra, Ken? (rock music) - [Kendall] Only my eyesight. (laughs) I ever tell you I love you? - [Teresa] Only when you're drunk, though you did ask me to marry you once. - [Kendall] Oh, shit, I knew I forgot somethin'. Take that big of a drink, you're not thinkin' about marriage? Besides, thinking of the first day of school makes you shiver right to the bone. - Fuck you, bastard. - [Detective Lonegan] Jesus. Hey, the first step to love. - [Kendall] Don't bullshit me, Dave, you hate me, too. Does that mean I should start to worry? - Hey, Ken, do me a favor, will you? Go fuck yourself. - (laughs) I'm just kidding. So, what'd you get back from the lab, anything? - Yeah, they found some traces of cocaine in his pocket, the one that was torn out? - So you think we need to scope out some dealers? - Maybe, maybe not, you see, it was just all a little bit too simple. Drug user, some cocaine, deal goes bad, gruesome killing, case closed. - What's the problem? - I just can't buy that a guy like that, with all his money, had to go to Brooklyn to get some blow. I mean, if we found him dead in his $2000 a night suite, I could say, "Hey, shit happens." But, here he is, over in Brooklyn. Layin' outside some blind alley, stinkin' of piss and dogshit, nah, it just doesn't ring true to me. - So what's your theory? - Well, I'm not sure, what do we know about this guy? Wall Street shark, is in charge of the slush funds, set up by anonymous corporations. He uses the funds to buy companies, break 'em up, sell off the pieces for a profit. So, ask me, I'd say the Wall Street shark got eaten by some piranha. - Yeah, right, now it's up to us to find out which piranhas, the deadly kind. - Didn't you have an appointment with your cousin, Melissa, at 9:00? You know, it's almost 9:30? - Shit, I forgot, I gotta go, Dave. - [Detective Lonegan] All right, take care, You want me to give you a lift? - I got my bike parked right over here. - [Detective Lonegan] All right, take care of yourself. - [Kendall] You, too. (dramatic music) (bluesy rock music) Melissa, it's me. Listen, I'm sorry I'm late. Are you gonna go to the conference center? All right, I'll tell you what, I'm gonna come by and pick you up, all right? Stay where you are. All right, bye. (creepy music) - The fuck? (creepy music) Where the fuck are you? (creepy music) (dramatic music) - [Laura] Hey, hey! (thrilling music) (dramatic music) - No, god, no! Help, help! (dramatic music) (Laura screams) (Laura groans) (Laura screams) (Laura gasps) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (thrilling music) (man screams) - Checkmate. (exciting music) - This is Jack O'Hara, reporting from City One News. There has been a homicide of a very young woman, who happens to live in this house, right here behind us. Her name is Laura Ashton, she has been-- Hey! - Right, for you see, the girl is free! (laughs) - I'm sorry, I don't know who that was. This is Jack O'Hara from City One News. (exciting music) (knocking) (bluesy rock music) (Kendall knocks) (Kendall knocks) (Kendall knocks insistently) (sensual music) (Kendall knocks) - [Doctor] Who is it? - My name's Kendall Ransom, I'm Melissa's cousin. - [Doctor] You know what time it is? - You might as well open the door, all right, 'cause I ain't gonna go away. Who the fuck is Hellinger? - Come on. (phone rings) - Yeah, this is Detective Lonegan. You want to speak up, there's a bad connection. Yeah, yeah, I think so. You found what? Are you sure about this? I don't care if you swear on the grave of your dead fuckin' cat, Sal, if things aren't exactly what you're saying, the captain is gonna have my ass for this. Let me tell you something, he comes after me because of this, I'll have your ass in a fuckin' sling before you even know it, that's a promise. Fuck, I should've listened to my mother. "Be an actor," she said, "you get to go places, "meet people," but I miss all the fun of shootin' people I don't like. (laughs) No fuckin' way. (sensual music) - Leave it on. - [Kendall] So you think Melissa is completely recovered, and just doesn't realize? - How many? - Five, thank you. I need a strong cup of coffee right about now. - Now let's return to the subject, here. I think that, from my experience as a psychiatrist, Melissa is finally comfortable with the homicide of her father, due to some escaped convict from a mental asylum. - I think the problem is this Hellinger. She's just fuckin' terrified of him. - Well, yes, and no. You see, I think the central problem is, it's her dread that she has of the dark. - What makes you say that? - Well, you've lived with her, since she fled her mother's home, and came to New York to start a new life. You know that she has to sleep with a very bright nightlight. Well, you know, that wouldn't be a problem. Except, in New York, where, of course, you have brownouts, and blackouts, and power failures, and destruction. And that light causes her extreme panic. I mean, she will go crawling to the farthest corner of her room, weeping in terror. Basically, she becomes like an eight year old child again. - I hate to say it, but I think you might be right about that. You know, she went to come over and have dinner at my apartment, the lights went out in the whole building. Happens all the time, all you have to do is go down to the basement, reset the circuit breaker, and they come back on, but she would not let me leave. She was so terrified, she sat there the whole time, holding onto my hands like her life depended on it. - Yeah, and then? - Well, a little while later, the lights came back on. We finished eating dinner, neither one of us said a word about it, but it was a little embarrassing. - Well, your embarrassing moment is safe with me. But you said something interesting, here, something I've been thinking about. - What's that? - Normally, a case of phobia is, they're fairly common. But, in Melissa's case, it's extreme. I mean, it's almost unique. I think what we could do is we could institutionalize her, put her in a padded cell with a straitjacket, observe her. So, with her reactions, we could develop a course of therapy, it may help her. It's either that, or if she continues on her course that she's going, she'll commit suicide. Or, she could die of her own fears. - Shit, and we call you men of science. - Listen, I'm not defending my colleagues. But they are men of science, they're people who want to know the answers, not just guess at it. This curiosity is a normal human characteristic. - If you ask me, I think they'd probably skin their own mothers alive, just to see what level of pain they could tolerate. Probably make a real good article for Scientific American, you know? But, we're getting off the subject, here. We're talking about Melissa. - Well, back to her phobia, in all odds, all I have here is a theory. - Well, let's hear it. - Well, for Melissa, the dark is a container. A very big container; a better word would be infinite. No beginning, no end, a container without boundaries. I know it sounds crazy, but it does exist. It's the nothingness. - Gives me a headache just thinking about it. - Yeah, well, what we're dealing with here is basically the black hole of the subconscious. Frightening, isn't it? For Melissa, dreams become real, vice versa. Her real monster is the dark, a Twilight Zone, suspended somewhere between the dimensions of the human spirit, and rationality. - Great, so she starts hearing music and sees the ghost of Rod Sterling, I'll be sure to call you, right away. - [Doctor] Yeah, sure. - Listen, I want to ask you a personal question, and I want you to answer me honestly. - Yeah, shoot. - Do you believe Hellinger exists? - As a psychiatrist, no. But as a man, yes. This conversation can't go any farther than this. It's kind of unhealthy for a psychiatrist to be talking loonier than his own patients. I mean, I do have a reputation to uphold. - I think I see some skeletons in your closet, doc. - (laughs) Yeah. No, you're on the wrong track, here. There's nothing personal about this. Not either me or my family. I first got interested in Hellinger a long time ago, when I was in college. I learned a little bit on my own, but later, when I received my PhD, I had an opportunity to meet one of his loyal disciples. That disciple paid for his loyalty with his life. Killed, by the same ghost that now haunts Melissa. - It's all in here, isn't it, the whole fuckin' story. - There it is. - Can I take this with me, I'll bring it back in a few days? - Well, sure, yeah, but I want you to promise me that you won't let anyone examine the contents of this. Okay, come on, promise. - I swear on my heart, I will not let anyone see whatever perverted shit might be in this book, satisfied? - Yeah, sure, it's good enough. - All right, well, I gotta go, doc. But I just wanna tell you before I go, I sure hope I don't end up as one of your patients. - Yeah, I hope so, too. - What's the matter, you afraid to come near the door? You afraid Hellinger's gonna get you? - Hey, listen, to answer your first question, the door locks, automatically. To answer the second, why should I be afraid of the very people that helped me achieve one of my major goals in my life? - What's that? - Swiss bank account. (laughs) (sensual music) (Melissa moans) (Melissa moans) (Roger gasps) (creepy music) (dramatic music) (Roger gasps) (dramatic music) (Hellinger moans) - No, no. - Don't waste your tears, Melissa, he isn't worth it. He didn't love you, he didn't care for you. He didn't live for you, as I do. - Why, why, why, haven't you just left me? Please, what have I ever done, what did I do? - You don't understand, do you, Melissa? The eyes, Melissa. The eyes are the mirror of the soul. The eyes, look into his eyes. Look into his eyes, Melissa. Blackness. Blackness, blackness! (Melissa sobs) As black as his soul. This is what happens to those who plot against me, Melissa. To those who think that they can fool Hellinger! - What are you talking about, what are you saying? - Heed my warning, precious. Beware of those around you. Even as I've told you all of this, you still want to kill me. Do you, Melissa? You want to kill the master of your dreams. Do you, Melissa? The creator of your destiny. Oh, Melissa. You want to live a normal and boring life, like those in your pathetic, little world. Is it not better to die, Melissa? The decision is yours, and yours alone. But remember. Sometimes, hate can be confused with love. (Melissa shrieks) (phone rings) - Hello, yeah. What? You've gotta be kidding me. Where? All right, okay, I'll be right over, all right. - Listen, I'm sorry I took time off last night. But this case is really starting to get to me. Melissa's a total basket case, and all I've got to go on, so far, is a bunch of fairytales about some guy named Hellinger or Donaldson. - Which one is it, Hellinger, or Donaldson? - That depends on who you ask. I got this from Melissa's shrink. I promised him I wouldn't show it to anybody, so keep your shit under your hat. - Okay. - From what I can tell, he was this priest. His name was Donaldson, Thomas Donaldson. He was one of the first media evangelists in the late '50s. Now, this Donaldson guy, he was way out there. He had a tremendous following, and a shitload of power. One day, this Donaldson, he decides that, he don't need the Catholic church, anymore. And he starts his own thing, he calls it The Dwellers of the Light, and that's when the problems began. The further he moves from the Catholic church, the more he begins to doubt its teachings. He becomes obsessed with the idea of learning the truth about Heaven and Hell. He decides he wants to see the gates of Heaven, before he dies. Now, his sermons take a bizarre twist. Some of his followers think that he's lost his sanity. Others think he's made a deal with the devil. Finally, he closes down his church, starts talking crazy to everybody. All of his followers, they abandon him. Parents start to use his name to scare their kids, like "Crazy Father Donaldson "will get you, if you don't eat your pea soup." Now, one day, his apartment catches fire. By the time the firemen get there, it's too late, there's nothing they can do. They finally get the fire put out, they go through the ashes, they find his body. It's burned to a crisp. Now, this would be the end of the story, except for one weird detail about the whole thing. You see, his eyes, they didn't burn in the fire. They turned as black as coal, and hard as stone. But they didn't burn. Now that was around Christmas 1966, okay, and people in the town, they talked about it, but nobody could figure out a reasonable answer for why this happened. Some said that he really did make a deal with the devil, that he did get to see the gates of Heaven, but that Satan didn't want him. That the vision would be so powerful that it would blind him; his entire body would be consumed with Holy fire. They said he paid the price for his arrogance. For his desire to transcend the human limits of the flesh. - Okay, so whatever truth there is, and whatever really happened is a mystery that this Father Donaldson has taken with him to his grave. - Yes, but people were so impressed with his story, that they're still talking about it, to this day. But the reality of the whole story is that the spirit of this Father Donaldson is now some kind of killer puppet, forever in the strings of Satan. That he became Hellinger. - You want me to believe that some fuckin' urban legend killed Melissa's boyfriend, Roger Barrow, right in front of her eyes tonight, and then vanished? As she said to my assistant, "Into the darkness, "like he was not of this world"? - Obviously not, I just think she had a nervous breakdown. I mean, she sees this maniac as the living representation of her deepest nightmares. But I don't think she belongs in a mental hospital, or anything, I just think that she's being stalked by some kind of psychopath, someone so strong that he could kill a guy like Roger. Even though he defended himself with a knife, he don't put a scratch on the bastard. Now, the only real question is, why is he persecuting Melissa? - I don't know, Ken. Look, I'll call the FBI tomorrow, and let them in, on this case. Find out what we can do for her, give her some protection. Until then, she's your responsibility. Don't mess this one up, Ken. Don't try to be a hero. If you need any help, call, and please, take care of yourself. - You're a true friend, man, thanks. (sighs) You've had a tough day. Why don't you lay down for a little while, I got some pills that might help you get some sleep, okay? (Melissa sighs) (dramatic music) - Come to me, Melissa. Be mine, come. Come. Come to me, Melissa. (Kendall sighs) (dramatic music) - The fuck? - Time to die! (Kendall screams) (Hellinger laughs) Mm, the mind is a terrible thing to waste. (dramatic music) - Go back to hell, motherfucker! Melissa? (dramatic music) What the fuck are you doin' here? - I know where she is. - Oh, you know where she is, do ya? - Not now, we need to go. (thrilling music) He lives here. - Where? - Tenth floor. - Call the cops, now! - Come, my dear. Come and pray with me. - What is this place? - This ... This is my home. It was, then, it is, now, and forever shall be. - But why, why have you called me here? What do you want from me? - [Hellinger] Many, many years ago, my precious, I was a respected man of God, with ambition. The ambition to prove the existence of all that I preach. That God, Melissa, God was light. A warm and loving light, like the sun which gives us life, without which, we would all perish. (dramatic music) Try to imagine, Melissa, try to imagine a world in which you are truly free. A world in which there is no Heaven, a world in which there is no Hell. That when you die, that light within you, that which is your soul returns to where it came from. Is that light God? This is the knowledge that I was trying to teach. But they ruined all of that. Thanks to the knowledge of astral projection, based on an old book written by the druids of Stonehenge, I was so close, but they stopped me. I was too close. Their first thought was that Satan had corrupted my soul, but they were wrong! They entered my room while I was on a spiritual fledge, saturated my body with gas, and they burned me alive. Leaving my soul with nothing to return to. I had the answer, Melissa, I had the answer which had freed man from his slavery to God. And for that, for that, they burned me alive. The Hindu called it karma, the infinite circle of souls always reincarnating. - It's impossible. - No, Melissa, it's true! It's true, you have my light within you. - That's a lie, you're lying. - You must believe me, Melissa, you must believe me, because I love you. I love you, my precious. - You killed her. You bastard, you killed her! - No, no, Melissa, it was Roger. And he was going to kill you, just like he killed your friend, Laura. He's just a puppet in the hands of revolution. And when Laura threatened to tell you that they were having sex, Roger found a bad way to end things, to his liking, rather than accept his responsibility. But he began to hate you, Melissa, and he wanted to harm you, just as he promised. (Hellinger laughs) Because to hurt you, is to hurt me. (dramatic music) I had to kill them, Melissa, I had to kill them all. - Back away from Melissa, you're a fuckin' maniac. - Not necessarily, it's over. - [Hellinger] Come to me, Melissa. Come. (dramatic music) - Let's get out of here. (dramatic music) (creepy music)
