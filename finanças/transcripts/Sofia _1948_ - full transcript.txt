[RESONANT PERCUSSION] [MUSIC PLAYING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC CONTINUES] NARRATOR: The Balkans-- where wars begin and intrigues never end. So it has always been. So it is today. Our story begins in Istanbul, capitol of Turkey. The first light before Turkey. [MUSIC AND CHATTER] [INCREASINGLY DRAMATIC MUSIC] [CHATTER OF CROWD] [LOUD MUSIC] [BEAUTIFUL SINGING] -(SINGING) Dear lovers, give me your heart. My dear lovers, let us be ever together. Pray that my woes have passed. Dear lovers, give me your arms. My dear lovers, and let me caress you. Hold you close at last. [CONTINUES SINGING] -Morning, Mr. Braden. Happy to see you. -Dajik. Looking for you, were we? -No, no. [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. -How is he doing? -[INAUDIBLE], for sure. [SINGING CONTINUES] [SONG ENDS] [APPLAUSE] -Let me in, quick. -You're all set, then? -Cognac. -Coffee. Thank you. -They got Erik, huh. -I know. You claiming the body? -I can't. Too dangerous. -Well, I can. I'm not connected with any government. I [INAUDIBLE] myself. -Then stay out of this, Steve. I-- -I'm sick and tired of this rat race. Selling phony passports, peddling wrong information to our "friends." They mean nothing when guys like Eric get bumped off. -I know, but he didn't die in vain. He broke out a very important report. -[CHUCKLES GRIMLY] Yeah. Uncle Joe got a two-face. -Linda Carlsen, at the theater-- [INAUDIBLE]. -You're drunk. -Wait a minute. Take it easy. -They've been dead six years. -It will be [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] They survived the concentration camp until the Russian army got to Vienna. [INAUDIBLE]. Pretty bad shape. They managed to patch him up. Too valuable to let him die. -What will they do with Sofia? -They've been [INAUDIBLE] for other scientists. There's a much needed new brain in the atomic field. -You don't believe that, do you? What are you gonna do about it? -Try to get them to a neutral country. [INAUDIBLE]. You must see clearly on the other side of the curtain. -Oh, that's my job. -Count me in, Steve. -Look like it's solo, Alex. -Should have taken a loan, Steve. You're going behind the curtain. Dr. Stoyan and all our friends are underground men. Hardly know them. [INAUDIBLE] Bomb [INAUDIBLE]. That espionage crap. I don't think they can make it stick when it comes to trial. If it comes to that, they'll have to let him go. [INAUDIBLE]. -What are you driving at? -We promised him [INAUDIBLE] would be delivered safely to Sofia. Ali and I will be the figurehead boys. -You should have been born a [INAUDIBLE]. -You take care of your ass, Ali. [INAUDIBLE] are remaining at Nightingale. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Come in. Mr. Roark to see you, Mademoiselle. -Tell him to wait a moment. -Yes, Mademoiselle. -Time for us to separate. Try to find out for me more. Get him to talk as much as you can. -He's no fool. -No. But he's receptive to money. He will sell anything for a price. -Besides, even they have to pay, you see. -What's the matter? Jealous? -Just a [INAUDIBLE]. Well, he is good-looking. And emotions are unpredictable. But I'm sure, my dear, you will be able to handle it. -Enter. -Hello, angel. -Hello, darling. Aren't those cigars a little heavy for you? -It was business. -Well, you shouldn't have any objections if the price is right. -Good luck! -All right. [INAUDIBLE] isn't going to get us anywhere. I'm here on business, too. [INAUDIBLE] ready to spend 10 grand, right? -$10,000 to be played in [INAUDIBLE]. -Try [INAUDIBLE]. -Is it better? -It might. Who is it? Goltzen? -Yes. He was a man of many political convictions, I think. Nazi who had to have money to liberate his copilot. Very good. -What do you care? -I don't. Especially not now. -Good evening. Chairman, we have permission to see Prisoner Chodorov. -These papers are signed by very high officials. I am at your service. -Come with me. --[SHOUTING] How long they gonna keep you here? -Shut up. -Chodorov! Chodorov! You have five minutes. Right here. -Keep walking. -What are you doing? -I'll tell you. -Puka, I don't want to get into any trouble, you know. -Take it easy. Chodorov, my name is Roark. I'm here to help you. This is Mr. Cuadlo, an attorney. He'll explain everything to you. Go ahead, Cuadlo. -I don't need a lawyer! -But Mr. Roark, I-- -Go ahead and explain to him. -I have been in groups in strike of the king, but-- Oh! -All right. Come on. Slip it on and let's go. Don't be a fool. Let's go! -I don't want to be killed! -OK, [INAUDIBLE] without me. Password is stars and elk. Put it on, and let's get out of here. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] -Oh, American. [INAUDIBLE] -[MUFFLED PROTESTATIONS] -Lift it up. Thank you. Well, gentlemen, to the payoff. -This amount of money you were paid in Istanbul. -Ah, but not in cash. That I was to get here on delivery. -Mr. Roark, do you realize you are in Sofia now. -Geography doesn't interest me, Mr. Goltzen, although I will admit the climate here is slightly warmer. -Your information is remarkably correct. -My business, one can't afford to be wrong. And neither can you. -Mhm. Your contact who hired me in Istanbul is a lot more important to you than, uh-- than Chodorov. Or isn't she? -Well-- -Well, anyway. You know I've fitted quite a few of your friends with passports. Make a long story short, Mr. Goltzen, I've made a list of all those people and their activities-- just for fun, mind you. -Oh, now. -But I'd hate to see that list fall into the wrong hands. If I couldn't return to Istanbul, that might happen. -I guess we understand each other, Mr. Roark. [INAUDIBLE] shall try to make your stay in Sofia as pleasant and enduring as possible. -Not too enduring, hm? --[CHUCKLES SLIGHTLY] But, uh, what assurance do we have that that research you were just talking about will not fall in the wrong hands another time? -My business association with you're-- shall we say, friend?-- has been most profitable. I hope it'll remain so. -Excellent reason. -And now, may I? -Why, certainly. -Thank you. Conners, watch out for [INAUDIBLE]. Just a minute, Mr. Goltzen. I wonder if you'd mind having some of your men come in here and remove these microphones. There are a couple more in this room and some in the bedroom. Ali snores. He's liable to keep you awake. -Why, certainly. I'll have them removed right away. -Thanks. -Gentlemen, always at your service. -Now there is a sterling character. -This might be a [INAUDIBLE]. One. -Well, I need a shower. -Two. Three. KNOCK AT DOOR] -How did you get-- -Here? The evening paper Mr. Imagu ordered. -Huh? Oh, thank you. -If I can be of any other service, please call for me. My name is Dmitri. I'm the bell captain. -Oh. Will you wait a minute, please? Well, look at this product. -Really, what? The boy out there brought this paper. -Well? I didn't order it. Oh! -Take a look. -Hey, wait a minute. Here's nautical marked in red. -What's it say? -Uh, 30 demanded for the return of escaped prisoner. OK. -Forget the story. What's that little word in red pencil there? -It says why? -Why? -Our friends want to know what we're doing here. -We'd better check in right away. Our obituaries wouldn't make good reading matter. -Right. -Those were tailed -I'll take care of it. -Mhm. Even Roark-- instrumental in furnishing entire publicly with court paper, and [INAUDIBLE] a free [INAUDIBLE]. Roark receives 500 pounds from the sheriff. In the spring of 1946, Roark [INAUDIBLE] crossed the Yugoslav border into Greece. -How come you keep those files? I thought you were a scientist. -I am. But I also am the head of the Democrat element in Bulgaria and elsewhere in the Balkans. We have to be very careful with whom we are dealing. -In other words, you consider me an untrustworthy scoundrel and an international opportunist. Is that right? -I didn't say that, Mr. Roark. But you must admit, this information I have before me-- that is hardly the great topic of a paper for a philanthropist. I'm afraid we'll have to know the reason for your special interest in the two Austrian scientist. Are you knowing them before? -What difference does that make? -I also learned that your trip to Sofia has already led you to $10,000. We would like to help you. But, uh, we do not wish to be used in murder. We might know more about your connection with the two people in question. -I'll admit you've got a point there, Doc. Believe me when I tell you there've been very few moments in my life when money was unimportant. But this is one of them. OK, I'll go back to 1944. A little farmhouse in France. I was in the OSS. Lieutenant Commander Stark and myself were being briefed on the special mission into Austria by Colonel Braden, also of the OSS. -OK. Now, gentlemen, get those documents. -We'll try, won't we, Johnny? -We sure will. -Oh, here's the microfilm camera. There's a lot of papers. Use it. If not, try to bring back the real McCoy. -Huh. Quite a [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. [PLANE PASSING OVERHEAD] -[INAUDIBLE]. -Yes, sir. -Think another look at this photo. It's fairly recent. Linda Carlsen. Remember, the password is Alban. Think you can remember that phrase? -No trouble at all, Colonel. No trouble at all. -Well, happy landing. ROARK (VOICEOVER): Our meeting with Linda Carlsen was prearranged at a little restaurant where one of our men worked as a waitress. He showed up on time. I caught him by an older man. I think it was a scientist he worked with-- Dr. Viertel. And there was somebody else. A second man who was following him. That didn't help my job. But it didn't stop it. -Cognac? -Thank you. -Yes, sir. -A piece of pastry? -No, thank you. -Alban. -Yes, please. [TRAY CLATTERS] [MEN ARGUING] -You know, lemon water will fix that up. Will you come inside? There we are. [INTERPOSING VOICES] -Get you all wound up. A nice towel for you. There you are. -This isn't-- -Everything's going to be all right. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [ENGINE REVS] ROARK (VOICEOVER): We all drove up to a mountain village in the Alps-- southwest of Vienna. The drive took about three hours. I didn't mind it at all. The view was lovely. And so was the girl next to me. We got to the old village church just before supper. Brother Johannes, an old friend and confidant of [INAUDIBLE] and Dr. Viertal, took us to a little chalet that once belonged to the late Dr. Albert. -Make yourselves at home, Dr. Carlsen, Dr. Viertal. Everything is just as you left it. I'll get you some food. You must be famished. -[INAUDIBLE] a nice-- -Tall bottle of wine? Certainly, I'll take care of it. -Come over here. I'll show you something. This is the company's file of the later Dr. Albert's notes on atomic research. Other [INAUDIBLE] senseless notes, as well as my own. None of these findings have ever been turned over to any government. -Are all of these equally important? -They're findings, not conclusions, major. Their [INAUDIBLE] continuity. -And who's going to handle the documents so we don't get them all mixed up? -I could. -Well, if you think you want to try, I'll send Stark back to the rendezvous. I can have him make a repeat-- 14 days, instead of five. Meantime, we can complete the job. If we do, I'll get you to America. And I'll guarantee you a kiss of gratitude-- from Uncle Sam. -[LAUGHS SOFTLY] I'd like that. -You know there's a chance you might not come out of this alive-- a big chance. -I'll take it. -Linda and I plunged into our job like fiends. It was monotonous work-- wrapping page after page of manuscript-- hundreds of them, thousands. Figure findings, diagrams, scientific explanations. We stuck pretty close to the farm. But that was all right. We were near all the time. She was a wonderful girl-- always calm, and yet always sweet and lovely. Sometimes, in the early evening, we went into the little chapel. It was cool and peaceful here. And there was the smell of wax candles and funeral flowers. I almost forgot the passing time and my job. I learned how to pray again, for Linda. The thought of having to leave her in just a few days was almost too much for me. Oh, dear father in heaven, protect her. It was exactly three days later when we finished our job. We were destroying the last of the documents we'd photographed. -Well, I guess that's it. I, uh-- have you ever been kissed by a man with a beard? -No, why? -Remember that kiss I promised you from Uncle Sam? -Yes. -I don't think you'd mind if I collect it for him now. -Steve, no matter what happens, just remember this. ROARK (VOICEOVER): The next morning, I came into the study to meet Linda and take her back to Vienna. -Good morning, brother. -Morning. -Where's Linda? MAN (OFSCREEN): I can tell you about her. Come here. Come here. Come here. Show me your papers. -I, uh, left them upstairs in my room. I'll go and get them. -Mhm. Come here. [SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE] [GUNSHOTS] -God forgive you for your sins. -Sorry about that, father. Report it. Tell them who. It's better for you that way. -This is from Linda, for you. Go now, my son. -Say a prayer for me, brother. -I never saw her again. Now can you understand what it means to me to know that these people are alive? -Yes. -Then you'll help us get them out of here? I cannot promise to do anything without first contacting my colleagues. But I will do everything in my power. -Thanks, Doctor. -All set. Let's get to work. Where are the logs? -[INAUDIBLE]. -Oh? -As a matter of fact, she and Dr. Viertal are guests of honor [INAUDIBLE] there. [INAUDIBLE]. Shall you go? -Yes. The invitation says I must. Besides, I'd like to hear what they have to say. -Oh, so would I. I'll figure this. -You never [INAUDIBLE]. Don't forget. -I won't, Doc. [QUIET CHATTER] [MUSIC PLAYING] -You're not taking any chances. There are more enemies here than they've got in the Kremlin. -Invitation, please? -Invitation for what? -I said, invitation, please. -Let go. Oh! -All right, all right. Good evening. Please accept my apologies for-- -Go ahead. -Apologies accepted. I'm sure it's nothing, but they don't like to be fought. I didn't think we needed an invitation to come into the bar. -Certainly not. As a matter of fact, I left an invitation for you today. I was showing Mr. Roark the sights of Sofia. -Well, hello. I'm glad to see you. When did you arrive? -Today. I'm singing here in the Versailles room. I hope you'll come to hear me. -Naturally. I'm a great admirer of your voice. Laurent, we must go. -Oh, yes. Certainly, yes. -You there-- won't you ask Mr. Roark [INAUDIBLE] the party. It will keep you from being bored. -Well, it occurs to me that these gentlemen might be interested in mathematics. -Well, why not, if they're round figures. -[CHUCKLES] -Good evening, Doctor. -Good evening, Mr. Roark. -May I introduce Bulgaria's leading scientist, Dr. Stoyan of [INAUDIBLE] school. -Mr. Roark, good day. -How do you do? -American? -That's right. -Have you met our guest of honor? You too, gentlemen. -Pardon, Monsieur. Why do you enjoy [INAUDIBLE]? -Something on your mind? -Nothing, why? -You haven't said much. -I'm saving it until we have more privacy. Dr. Kal, may I introduce Dr. Stoyan. -Dr. Kal. -I've heard a great deal of you, Dr. Stoyan. -Pleased. -And this is Dr. Kal. -Delighted. -You should have very much to talk about. -May I present Mademoiselle Onescu? And Mr. Roark, an American. Great friends of mine, I believe. -Dr. Carlsen, Dr. Viertel. -No, the other way around. -Dr. Viertel, Dr. Carlsen. -Oh, I see. I'm sorry. I hope you'll forgive me. -Have you been here long, Mr. Roark? -Only since the war. -The war, oh yes. Most Americans went home and forgot about us. -Did they? -Sorry to interrupt you, but Dr. Stoyan has to [INAUDIBLE] and would like very much to discuss some [INAUDIBLE]. Dr. Carlsen. -Champagne? Uh, no thanks. I can't stand the noise. Excuse me. [INAUDIBLE] -Scotch. Thanks. -Coffee. You're getting in deep. -Shut up. Never proud of in my country-- a man cuts his own throat with his tongue. There's one thing to be thankful for. She's alive. -You mean, still alive. -Watch out. -You're being rather lewd. -Why? Because I don't like champagne? -Aren't you even going to say goodbye to them? -Who? -Your female scientist, and the other atomic with her. -Are they leaving? -Yes. You must have upset them-- or perhaps only her. -I'm not that good. -Oh, I don't know. There they are. Now's your chance. -Relax, [INAUDIBLE]. -You're leaving us so soon? -Dr. Viertel is not feeling very well. -Oh, I'm sorry. Is there anything I can do? -Thank you. I'm just a little tired. -Very thoughtful, but I'll take their arm, Mr. Roark. -I wish you every success. I hope to have the pleasure again. -Thank you. -Good night. -Good night. -You might be interested to know that Dr. Carlsen and Dr. Viertel worked for the United States army during the last war. -Really? -That was when you were on the German side of the argument, wasn't it? -Well, not for an intellectual worth a pint, Mr. Roark. Like you. -This is very boring. Let's dance. -Certainly, darling. -Remember the proverb. Mr. Roark? We are leaving on the 10 o'clock plane for Vienna tomorrow. -That doesn't give us much time. It would be impossible to get them out before 10:00. Don't try. -What if I come to your place in a half an hour? -I can do that. -I'm sorry, Mr. Roark. I've been overruled. -Due to what? -My colleagues consider it too dangerous and too risky to participate actively in your plan of [INAUDIBLE]. If we only had a little more time-- -In other words, you're telling me you've broken your word. Is that it? -You don't seem to understand that we cannot jeopardize months of work and planning to accommodate you. Accommodate me? Don't you realize what it means to get those people out of this country and back to the states? Why don't you tell them! -I did. But I've been overruled. -You mean you won't let them leave Bulgaria alive, is that it? -Yes. -You're going to kill them, huh? Murder them in cold blood rather than stick out your precious necks. Well, that's not the way we do it where I come from. I'm not through yet. And anybody who's fool enough to try to stop me is going to get hurt. Is that clear? C'mon, Ali. We've got work to do. -I've got the Carlsen's room number. -512. That's two floors above it. -Is there any other way to get into her room except by the front door? -The suite above her is unoccupied . You might try to drop down on the ledge outside her window. -OK, let's go. You work for me [INAUDIBLE]. -All right, but be careful. -How do you feel? -I'm all right. Do you think he will try to help us? -I'm sure he will try. -How wonderful seeing him again, wasn't it? -Go to bed, my dear. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SOFT MUSIC] [SOFT TAPPING AT WINDOW] [TAPPING AGAIN] -[INAUDIBLE] [ROMANTIC MUSIC] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [MUFFLED SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE] [SCREAM] -Looking for someone? -I would have liked to have said goodbye Mademoiselle Onescu. She was very nice to us. -Oh, she'll be very happy to [INAUDIBLE]. [ENGINE STARTS] -You'll protect the lady? -Yes, sir. -Who got on? -Only two women. -Here are the tickets. -I've furnished you with two escorts. In [INAUDIBLE], you will be met by Mr. Giletov. Good luck on your lecture tour, and bon voyage. -Put them up, you two! Now if everybody will remain quietly in their seats, nothing will happen. This is not a hold-up, and I'll try not to delay you too long. Ali? Frisk them. -[INAUDIBLE] Take this. -Sorry, boys. I'm going to have to borrow your airplane for a few hours. Make a little detour. Agent Imagu is Greek. [INAUDIBLE] -Dr. Viertel, may I see you a moment? Sorry, I had no choice but to mess with both of you, but I hope this will work out. I'm having the plane detoured at [INAUDIBLE]. I've just asked for an emergency landing there. You'll be met by Mr. Wilson, of the American consulate. [INAUDIBLE] I hope everything goes well for you and your wife. -How can I thank you? -It's all right. Good luck to you. -Thank you. -All right, Doctor. -Thank you. Take it away! -Dr. Viertel? -Yes, sir. -I'm Mr. Wilson from the American consulate. -How do you do? -My wife, Dr. Carlsen. -How do you do? We're expecting you. This way, please. [ROMANTIC MUSIC] -Thanks, boys. If you ever get to Istanbul, look me up. I'll buy you a drink. I'll look for the outskirts of some field and jump. I'm going back to check my fuel. So long. -So long. -So long. -[INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] Find out where they are. And remember this. Neither Dr. Carlsen nor Dr. Viertel must be allowed to leave Europe. -Yes, Ma'am. -What about this American? -[INAUDIBLE]. He has valuable information. Besides, he was one who helped the [INAUDIBLE]. -Yes, for $10,000. -He is reckless and courageous, and will do anything for a buck. -Like kidnapping a couple of scientists from under our noses? I wonder how much he got for that. I'd like to meet your friend, Mr. Roark. In the meantime, I want to know where he spent every minute of the last six hours. -Certainly, Madame. -That is all. -Hello. Sokolova. Get me a complete document on Stephen Roark from headquarters. That is all. -Key, please. 308. Right. Any developments? -Goltzen's been here several times looking for you. -[INAUDIBLE]? -Yes. I told him you and [INAUDIBLE] are going on to the steam bath. -Nice going. -Thank you. -I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. Let me off my floor, please. -Yes, sir. [INAUDIBLE] [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Who is it? -Me. -Hello, Valerie. You wanted to see me? -Where have you been? -Tired. And thirsty, do you mind? -You haven't answered me. -Where have you been all afternoon and all evening? -Hm? Oh, Ali and I went to the steam baths. -You mean the mud baths, don't you? -I don't get you. -Have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately? -Hm. This Bulgarian is pretty rough. -Why'd you take all the trouble of getting rid of your bodyguard? -Ah, you mean that annoying little man who insists on following me around? Ali and I like privacy when we take a bath. -Stop making a fool of me! I want to help you. -All right, darling. -What's on your mind? -I'll speak more plainly. Somebody held up the Vienna plan and kidnapped that Austrian girl and the old scientist. -You don't say? -And for your information, the steam bath alibi you thought up is no good. Goltzen has already found that out. -Really? -So I gave you a better one. -Let's hear it. -You were with me. We rehearsed a new American song, had cocktails together from 5:00 to 7:00 here, in my suite. -Aren't you compromising yourself? -You [INAUDIBLE]. -It wouldn't be a trap by any chance, would it, sweetheart? -Take it or leave it. -I'll take it. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING] [SINGING BEAUTIFULLY] -[INAUDIBLE] Stephen Roark. -Mhm. -And the other American-- the one who stood at the door-- who is he? -Mr. Braden. [INAUDIBLE] And they export and import [INAUDIBLE]. -[INAUDIBLE]. Are they friends? -All Americans are friends of the Balkans. -Hello, Jim. -Hello, Steve. -Hi. -Good to see you again, Ali. What are you doing in Sophia? -I'm holding a branch office here for my company. -Otherwise? -A new handling down here in the Balkans. I've got to find out who the players are. -And Inspector Logan. -Yes, is that a reason to [INAUDIBLE]? -Could be. But Sokolova, Goltzen, Manov, Crowe-- they're not the people who are connected with any government. They're just private citizens. Legends, or what have you. -Like yourself? -Could be. -Well, we're footloose again. We could use a job-- unofficially, of course. Of course. -I have a better idea. Our friends are tucked away safely, thanks to you boys. Waiting for a special plane to take them back to the states. I think tomorrow. Why don't you join them, please. I think you and Linda deserve a break. -Linda's married to Viertel. -Oh, well, I didn't know that. -Forget it. How about the job? -You might be too closely connected with some people here. -You mean Magda? -Mhm. --[CHUCKLES] She's working for me. -Oh? Then I wouldn't be exactly talking you into this job, would I? -By no means. -OK. I think that calls for a little toast. Waiter. [APPLAUSE AS SONG ENDS] -[INAUDIBLE] charming. Madame Sokolva, Magda Onescu. -Sit down, my dear. -I like your singing very much. But I like the reports on Mr. Goltzen by you even better. -Thank you. -You're the young lady who contacted Mr. Roark. -Yes, I am. -Good. I would like for you to obtain some more information for me. -What is it you wish to know? -Mr. Braden has been keeping quantities of merchandise from America every month. We believe that the United States is using these shipments as a disguise to smuggle and assemble atom bombs to bring into Turkey. To make sure whether this is true or just a rumor would be worth $20,000. -Isn't that rather low, considering the importance of the assignment? -You are an excellent businesswoman, besides being very beautiful. -Now? -Wait. Let them both come out. -Linda? -Yes, dear? -Tell me. I've been wondering about it. Why did Steve go back to Sofia? -I don't know. I suppose he had to go back. -Please, don't get angry with me if I tell you something. -I won't be. -He is in love with you. That's why. -Erik, why do you torture yourself? -I am a doctor. You have started a new life. But I want to be sure that you are here now. Will you get word to Steve to Mr. [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh, Erik. -Then you will be free. I want what's best for you. -Now. [SILENCED GUNSHOT] -Erik. -Promise me. Go to him. -Hello, Ali. -Good morning, Mr. Braden. -Where's Steve? -Oh, out. Won't you join me in a cup of coffee? -No, no thanks. Dr. Viertel was killed. -No. -Yeah, two hours before his plane was about to depart. Linda Carlsen has disappeared. No one knows where. -Shall I get Steve? -No, no. Don't. I can't tell him yet. It's tough to withhold a thing like this from a friend, but I'm afraid he'll tear out of here if I tell him now. -Well, just the man I wanted to see. -Well, don't tell me you've got the answer already. -No, no. --[INAUDIBLE] offered me [INAUDIBLE]. -Oh? -You try to get the information you want. She's offering me the same if I can get information for her, which you're supposed to be able to foot in. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY] Simple, isn't it? 35 figures for Imagu and Roark, Incorporated. Not bad, eh? -I like double crossing. -Really? What do the want to know? -Well, according to Magda, the United States has sent 10 unassembled atom bombs into the Balkans-- scaring the pants off our friends to have those firecrackers Said so near and ready for delivery. They're supposed to have been sent into the country piecemeal. In everything from curling irons, bobby pins, chewing gum. Your friend sells that kind of junk around here. True or false, Mr. Braden? -That's a great idea. Could I add just one little one? -Proper effect if the story is worth spreading. If it's believed, it can be just as potent as if it were true. You could do it. Keep the story rolling. Tell her you're working on me. -OK. How about that list you wanted? Magda's going to sing at some political vodka stag next week. It wasn't on her schedule. Madame Sokolova's request. The number she's preparing are the words of Yugoslavian, Hungarian, and Romanian composers. The whole thing sounds to me like a blind for a get-together for those big boys you think are [INAUDIBLE]. -Very possible. I figure we mustn't muck this one. -I'm expecting a tailor up today. I'm running out of clothes. See you later. [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Come in. -Hello. Hello, Stephen. -Hello, beautiful. Look what I have. [INAUDIBLE], supplies, microchips. -Wonderful woman. Black market? -'Course. -Mind putting them in the other room? -Sure. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -Saw Braden. -And? -I'm working on him. We're having dinner tonight. Do you want to join us? -He wouldn't talk in front of me. [INAUDIBLE] privately. -You can get the real names of those guests. We can make ourselves another nice piece of change. -Steve, if we get all that money, let's get away from here. -Oh, I'm afraid you'd have a little trouble. -Linda Carlsen got away-- with your help. -That's a pretty broad statement. -You're still in love with her. -What's gotten into you? -You're carrying a picture and those pressed flowers in your wallet. I never took you for a sentimentalist. -Spying on me, huh? -I couldn't help seeing it. -Well, just to ease your mind a little, I'd forgotten I was carrying them with me. Forget it. It doesn't mean a thing. -Will you take me away from here, Steve? I've never been afraid before, but I am now. -Look honey, if this thing is getting too tough for you, quit it. I don't want to see you get hurt. -Thanks for the warning. -I'm glad you're on my side of things. -I wouldn't be too sure of that, either. -OK. I'll keep my guard up. -Be, downstairs, huh? [SINGING] [SINGING BEAUTIFULLY] [CONTINUES SINGING] [SONG ENDS] [APPLAUSE] [INTRIGUING MUSIC] -Good evening. -Good evening, Madame. -I am to deliver this message to Mr. Stephen Roark. What room number should I put on it? -308, Madame. -Did a lady just come in here? Wearing a cape and a hood? -Yes, sir. She left a letter for Mr. Roark. -Let me see. -But Mr.-- -Hand it to me! Empty. Where's Madame Sokolova? -In the downstairs room. -Wait here. -Ali, you stand by in the bedroom. Magda's number should be about over soon. She's coming up here. As soon as I get that list, you run it over to Braden. -Here we go again. [KNOCK AT DOOR] -Linda! -I've been followed. -What on earth are you doing back here? -Oh, I got your note. -Note? -I got it the day after Erik was killed. -Erik? -Didn't you know? -Of course not. And I didn't send you this note. You've been tricked into coming back here. You've got to get away now. Ali, take her over to Dr. Stoyan's. -Stoyan? -Do as I tell you! -I didn't mean to be eavesdropping, but I couldn't help overhearing your conversation. -Get going, Ali. I'm afraid you'll find it a little difficult to leave the hotel. -Don't worry, Steve. I'll get her out. -Wait a minute, Ali. -I'm sorry Steve got you into all this trouble. -Shut up. -If he'd told you that we were very much in love, this might never have happened. [PHONE RINGING] -Well, isn't anybody going to answer the telephone? -You take it. -Hello? Well, yes, Madame. Who? Just a moment, please. -Madame Sokolova, for you, Doctor. -Hello. Yes. No, that will not be necessary. I'm coming down. Yes, now. -You've got your gun? Get her out. -But, Steve-- -Get her out! -I'll try. -Goodbye, Steve. -Good luck. Ready? -The next move is yours. That list of names you were going to bring me. -Oh, I see. The list. -Where is it? -I didn't bring it with me. It'll have to wait. -The list of names, I said. Where is it? -Let go of me. -You're not getting out of here until I get it. You understand? -Oh, no? [JIGGLES HANDLE] -C'mon Magda, open the door. I've got to talk to you. You hear me? -Where are they? -Waiting in the lobby. -Can we down to the basement? -Yeah. -Let's go. Let's go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -They went down to the basement. We have men there. -Come on. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] [SOUNDS OF COMBAT] -Sorry to inconvenience you, Doctor. You'd better take a couple of men and go to Mr. Roark's room. Bring him to me, and Magda too. -Yes, ma'am. -C'mon Magda. Open the door. I've got to talk to you. [KNOCKS AT DOOR] -Well, gentlemen. -Pardon the intrusion, Mr. Roark. But Madame Sokolova would like to discuss some matters with you. -I don't think I have anything to discuss with Madame Sokolova. -It might interest you to know that Linda Carlsen is with her right now. They are both waiting for you. You'd better take your hat. -Take this. [GUNSHOT] -Oh, I'm sorry, honey. Come over here. I'll get a doctor for your right away. -Oh, Steve. -Hello, give me the bell captain. Yes, the bell captain. [INAUDIBLE] -Come on. -Hello? This is Mr. Roark. Send a doctor up here right away. Yes, right away! Let me see, darling. -I never carry arms. -Yeah, I know. You let other people do your dirty work for you, don't you? Well, it isn't gonna help you this time, you dirty-- [SHOUTING]. Where's Linda Carlsen! Where is she? -125 Saint Nicholas Road. -Well, you're going to take me there. Now you be quiet, darling, until the doctor comes. -Oh, Steve. -I'll be back soon. -I always prayed that something like this would happen. -I'm sorry. I did the best I could . There were too many for me. [PHONE RINGS] -Hello. Yes, Mr. Braden. Yes. Dr. Stoyan speaking. Yes, I called you. I've got to see you right away-- about Roark. He left the hotel with Mr. Goltzen. I don't know. I'll meet you in 15 minutes. All right. -I'm ready. -Thank you, Doctor. [WISTFUL MUSIC] -Where did Goltzen say they were going? Do you remember? Tell us if you can. Steve's life may depend on what you say. -125. -125. Saint Nicholas Road. -Saint Nicholas Road. Thank you, Magda. -Linda Carlsen was what Steve wanted. -Thank you. I'll take care of it. -Tell him I'll get along all right. I always have. -I'll tell him, Magda. Thank you, Doctor. -Go with some of my men that will go where I tell them. -Oh, yes. We'd best get them out of there right away. I'll arrange for a plane right now. See you later. -(WITH VOICE SHAKING) Compared to some of the Nazi torturers I met in the concentration camps, you're just an amateur, Madame Sokolov! -Oh, yes? For your sake, I hope you don't force me to prove how wrong you are! So for the last time, will you tell me who the people are with whom you were put in contact in Athens-- and what information you gave out to them. -They have never succeeded in making me talk. -No? -No. They tried. For years! Look. The one who gave this to me was called Ana Meyland. And your name is Sokolov. There's really no difference-- except that she's dead from a rope around her neck! -How many men has she got around the place? -About half a dozen. When they see you are-- -No, you get me through. -I will. -And no tricks. -I am Mr. Goltzen. I am a courier with them. Hurry up! -Yes, sir. -Open up. [DOOR CREAKING] -All right. -Where are they? -Upstairs. -Lead the way. [WOMAN SCREAMING] [HEAVY TUMBLING] [GUNSHOT] -Oh! -Bring him in. -Give me that. [THUMPS] -So what happened? I gather you bungled this up, too. [INAUDIBLE] Perhaps this will change your mind. Do you wish to make a statement before Mr. Roark does? I believe he talks much more freely than you do for money. -[SMALL SOB] [BLOWS LANDING] -[GROANS] -[COUGHS SLIGHTLY] -Not a pretty sight, eh, Mr. Roark? But don't worry. You can change all that by merely answering a few questions. -What do you want to know? -Tell us what you've been doing here, since you've honored us with your visit. Tell us about Dr. Carlsen's contacts in Athens. -Come, come, Mr. Roark. You've gotten her into this mess, and it's still up to you to get her out of it. LINDA (WEAKLY): Don't. -I have a plan. I wanted her to have freedom. I wanted to give her a little happiness she'd never had before. I love her. Is there anything wrong in that? -Shall we dispense with sentimentality? -I had a [INAUDIBLE]. I haven't any idea how much she told of what she knows. Probably nothing. She'd be with the fellow most likely to understand what she was talking about. That's all there is. -Sorry to interrupt this tender evening, but would you be kind enough to supply me with some of the details? I need those of a more scientific nature-- from the letters. -I was never [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] -I know this place Heavily guarded. -I'll take care of that. -They're armed. -So am I. Bring your best men. Go. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC] -Sign this. -But I didn't say anything like this. -It's my interpretation of your confession. It really doesn't matter what it says. But it will save time and money when you go to trial. Sign it. -You will leave here tomorrow. In the meantime, you may rest. Take her to her room and see that she's comfortable. -Yes, Madame. [ALARM SOUNDING] [CRASHES] -Somebody must have set off the alarm. [ALARM AND BANGING CONTINUE] [SOUNDS OF STRUGGLE] -[INAUDIBLE]. [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] -Come here, you. Turn around! You're coming with us. [INAUDIBLE] Start moving. -[INAUDIBLE] Ali? -Yes. Madame Sokolova, go back into the house. -Come down, Steve. It's all right. The guys over there-- they have to stay waiting for you. See you in a minute. -We're going home, darling. -Home. [MUSIC SWELLS] [MUSIC PLAYING]
