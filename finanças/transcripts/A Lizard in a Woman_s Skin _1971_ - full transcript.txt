Come in, Frank I didn't know my father had to knock too He doesn't have to. But your father is polite Yes, but he's your husband Husbands can have good manners too You mind if I take an aspirin? I caught a cold riding the motorbike Our friend Deborah's coming to dinner tonight - Shall I bring you breakfast? - No, I'm coming now - Has Frank gone? - Yes. Don't you know how late it is? - Do you recognize this hallway? - It's from the house next door Strange... How would I know? I've never been in there No house has a hallway that long In your subconscious it's the hallway in the flat next door You've often dreamed about it. It's always the same And... as always, filled with naked people Then, suddenly, you fall into nothingness and find someone... ...always the same person... ...waiting for you... - Julia Durer Exactly. Julia Durer, your neighbor You dream of having an affair with this woman who lives next door To you that woman represents sin, moral degradation The house next door is a symbol of vice From what you've told me, Mrs Durer is not exactly respectable No. She certainly is not You see? Your conscience forces you to disapprove of her lifestyle But at the same time her freedom attracts you That conflict's the root of your recurring dream The chilly sexual relations between you and your husband... ...distort things so that, subconsciously... ...you're attracted by Julia Durer's lifestyle What's up with your neighbors? Sounds like a football match But the music's pretty good, eh, Deborah? Carol... Carol? - Cognac? - No thanks, daddy A shame... If you got drunk every night instead of wasting money on Dr. Kerr I'm sure it would cure your insomnia I don't like how Carol's been acting lately She needs a break A holiday would be good for her. Don't you think? She'd have to go alone Joan has exams... ...and who will look after the firm with you on the electoral trail? Think about it Home, Larry I can't concentrate in London ...the Party, hassles with the Nicholson case, it's all too much Know what I'm doing tomorrow? Going to my house in Greenfield to finish that Common Market speech So I'll have to defend Tommy? He won't like it! Frank, don't say that - Hi -Hi You're a partner now. And you know why? - Because I'm your son-in-law? - Come on... Frank, Tommy isn't your problem. You'll be fine, I know it - But it's Monday and tonight... - What? You've an appointment with Warren in Harberville No problem. I'll go to Harberville and return tomorrow It's a long way An hour and a half drive The hearing's at ten, if I leave by eight I'll be fine The only problem is having to sleep over You best be off then Yes? Mrs Smith?...Who's she? Really?... A personal matter? Aright, I'll talk to her Yes... Yes... Look, who are you? Explain yourself, I don't understand What? Someone in my family? But who...? I just want to know... Hello...? Hello? Why not have dinner with Carol tonight? Yes... that's a good idea Aright, I'll be off then Tell me, Frank... ...are you cheating on my daughter? I trust you're joking? Yes... yes, I was joking You killed Julia Durer... By killing this woman, you killed the part of you attracted by vice This internal conflict was resolved by an act of violence... ...a liberating dream Symbolized by the rotting bodies of those you live with The presence in the dream of the stepdaughter you feel unloved by is another clear sign of liberation But those... ...that man with the red hair... ...the girl. Those hippies on the balcony Witnesses invented by your Ego You wanted them to witness the crime Preventing you from picking up the fur coat and paper knife Which meant you were forced to leave evidence behind It's the positive removal of a mental block Dr. Kerr, do you think I should thank Julia Durer? When did she die? Tuesday, going by the state of the body Or Monday night - I bet that's Jackson report - Probably Always so vague. Lots can happen in 24 hours - The body hasn't been on ice - Right, it's Saturday - Bad day to discover crimes - It was the cleaning lady She went twice a week but didn't have keys to the place She couldn't get in Wednesday. Durer often left without a word Today she noticed the smell And ruined our weekend Morning, Inspector You're Inspector Corvin? I'm Lowell, head of crime scene unit Since when? Last week. I was Head of Filing That's reassuring Heroin Inject that much, you'd break the sound barrier - Hilarious - Thanks Typical filing room joke Inspector? The body's in here Tell it to wait - Any more drugs? - A bit of everything - Hash, LSD, cocaine... - What do the neighbors say? The cleaning lady says they treated her like a leper Asked how she got the money to live here Me too. Question them all But discreetly. One of them is the daughter of a top politician So you can't tell me anything? - Was Durer a friend of yours? - No, we didn't even know her Sorry, but I don't think we've much to tell you - Nothing to shed light on this crime - Crime? I'm confused, miss, I don't believe I mentioned any crime - Why would you say that? - It's pretty obvious The place is full of police with a ton of scientific equipment All these questions... Do you go to all this trouble if someone slips on a banana peel...? ...and bumps their head? Sometimes we handle those cases too A person may have placed that banana peel on purpose Anyway, yes there has been a crime It was committed last Monday... or Tuesday Most probably sometime between Monday night and Tuesday morning Did any of you notice anything strange? Things like screams, noises... ...loud bangs? - Monday night? Only thunder. Do you remember? We had that big storm Did you hear anything, Mrs. Hammond? Mrs. Hammond? No, nothing. Just thunder Fine. But do call us if you remember anything at all... No matter how small Carol... Carol? Monday night... The night of the storm The night Frank went to Harberville Yes... That night Yes, it poured all night. I remember It was so bad I even had to stop driving for a while Julia Durer? That's unbelievable. I can imagine... Yes, Joan, I'm coming now Our neighbor, Julia Durer... - That noisy bitch? - Someone killed her - That doesn't surprise me - Joan says Carol's upset Really? You must go to her, Frank Of course She turned the place upside down... ...trying to find her fur - Mrs Gordon on floor 3... ...says Julia Durer was strangled, half-naked with a fur next to her You didn't bring the paper, Frank? You always bring it The paper, Carol? Oh yes, I'm sorry I've got it I must have left it somewhere, I'll look for it later - What are you hiding from me? - Carol! Stop dwelling on all this I want to But it's not easy... With everything that's going on - Yes? - It's Mrs Gordon Mrs Hammond is dining, Mrs Gordon Don't bother her. Ask her to call me back I need to talk to her, about something very, very important Mrs Gordon? My dear... Have you read the papers yet? Not yet. Why? I got it wrong, what I told you before That good-for-nothing Durer was not strangled No, my dear, not at all They stabbed her three times. Each blow fatal It's all in the papers - When do you need the car, ma'am? - Shut up, idiot!... Sorry, sweetie Two of them in the chest... ...and one just below And with a paper knife! Can you imagine the horror...? Carol... What are you doing? What's wrong? The paper knife! Frank, it's not possible Not possible that my paper knife has gone too I have to find it... She was killed with a paper knife. Like I killed her in my dream Stabbed in the chest Just like I stabbed her with my paper knife That's ridiculous, Carol Oh, Frank. Help me Frank. Help me... I'm begging you... - Why do you want to see the body? - No specific reason - She was our neighbor and... - Fine If you want to see her... Come along Does that fur coat mean anything to you? - Your wife's here Mr Hammond - Carol! - What were you thinking? - I told her to wait outside - Carol! - Brandon! Quickly!... Carol says the body was in the same position as in her dream It's possible. But all the rest? Maybe you can ask to see the rest of the evidence To check it is Carol's fur coat and paper knife Ah, it's crazy. No other word for it We owe Carol some kind of explanation There's only one explanation... ...someone's trying to drive her mad Someone who knows what happens in her dreams - Make sense to you? - None of this makes sense It's all absurd If she wasn't my daughter I wouldn't believe a word of it If someone came to me with such a story, I'd throw him out Seems an easy case to me We just need to look at the social circle Durer lived in Ex-actress, junkie, she must have plenty of similar friends We turn up the heat and one of them will crack That's true, Chief. Those types love to talk No pressure needed But none of it's ever any use - You think? - That's not how to do it You have a better idea? So far... the only hard evidence we have are the fingerprints Prints on the coat, paper knife, and scarf - Find the woman who owns it - That's just a guess Who says it's a woman? The fur coat is not the victim's You think the killer's a woman But the cleaning lady might be wrong She didn't recognize the fur coat But remember, she didn't recognize the boots either - The ones Julia Durer was wearing - They were new You could tell from the soles. She'd just bought them Chief McCloud... Yes, Inspector Corvin is here... Wonderful! He confessed Come, my dear Inspector. The Durer case is solved I almost forgot - the killer is a man Bye, Mino... There he is. Name Harry Smith Hippie, Homeless. 23 years old. It's him, alright Irish, red hair, knew Miss Durer - Has a conviction for a sex crime - The prints match? We've not checked, but he spilled the goods After you, sir Aright son, so you confessed. Good for you. - So, tell us - I did it... ...to avenge my brother George - When my brother... - The facts! The Inspector wants to know how you killed her She was there, in front of me, with her fur coat She had it on now, eh? Yes, she was wearing it. Very classy... She had on the fur coat... and boots too. The black boots I told her... take off the coat And... she took it off And then she was naked - Was she wearing a white scarf? - No no, I told you, nothing Just... ...black panties and the boots - She was beautiful, all naked... - Yes, we got that. Go on... So... so I said... You remember my brother George? And then I stabbed her with the dagger! You mean with the paper knife... With a paper knife? No... No, with the dagger, my brother George's dagger I pushed it into her belly, right up to the hilt! Then I twisted it... Twisted it! Twisted it...! You don't believe me, right? You don't... I can tell from your faces Right then... Look, here's her guts Along with the Prime Minister I killed this morning Make sure he eats them Long live Ireland, land of heroes! Down with the Queen! Back to work, chaps - You... - I... Get back to Animal Welfare What will you say to them? - That you saw them in a dream? - Joan, please!...l'm going insane Carol, you have to make up your mind - But all these people... - All right... - Well? - Nothing... Where do you get such ideas? Don't let your imagination run away with you Maybe there's an explanation They knew Durer. They went to her house a few times You probably saw them, when they were going in or out So one night you dreamed about them They said they were friends of hers? No, I was just guessing Joan! Eddy Berry, you bastard, how are you? We photographed the victim's body, the murder weapon... ...collected fingerprints. But I'd like you to focus on... ...the footprints on the floor No matter how much one tries to wipe them dry... ...the sole of a shoe or a foot will always leave prints We call them damp prints, and we always manage to get them - And it was raining that night - Exactly So whoever entered the house that night, had to leave damp prints Look at this enlargement we made There are many, many prints around the living room Same thing in the hallway. And they're all damp prints Good work We're very thorough So one of these prints is the killer's No!... I mean... - Why not? - Well, as I showed you... Prints can be found here and in the rest of the house Except in the area around the victim's bed There are no prints there at all. See? Not one I don't get it. That's where... ...the crime was and the body found... ...and there are no prints So, none of the people who left damp prints... ...could have killed her Not one of them. Unless they took their shoes off Maybe. But I think there's a much simpler theory - For sure. The killer... - Yes? The killer's shoes were dry so they'd not been outside... ...but maybe came from... ...an apartment in the same building Which narrows the field a lot - So let's check - Certainly inspector As always, we'll check from top to bottom Our suspicions point to this guy who's a repeat offender Have you seen this man around here? Please Miss, have a good look You too, Mrs. Hammond Can I have a look? Of course, sir No, never seen him These are the enlargements, Inspector Thumb prints of everyone who touched the photo So?... Carry on And here's a blow-up of one of those prints And one of the prints from the paper knife You see? A perfect match So? - Well, Inspector... ...the print matching the one on the paper knife... ...was taken from the photo marked B And it belongs to... Let me check... ...to Mrs Carol Hammond Mrs Hammond... ...it's my duty to inform you that from now on... ...anything you say may be used against you You ask a lot of questions You want to ask if I killed her I'm your father, Carol. I'm asking as your father... ...not as a lawyer. I'll get you bail... ...even if you're accused of a terrible crime But please understand, I need to know the truth - The truth...? - I'm begging you Dad, I can only say one thing Just one... I didn't kill her Carol... That's all I need to know When a judge sets bail so high... ...it's clear he has few doubts - Lucky him I, on the other hand, am full of doubts and questions But her prints are all over the murder weapon The paper knife and fur coat are her's Sure, evidence... We have lots of that - But no shred of motive - True, but the facts remain Did you know Hammond was in therapy? Really? Maybe they'll claim insanity and she'll get off I don't know. But a lot can change once we find a logical motive I need to find it, or I'll be the crazy one You killed Julia Durer. Furthermore, this dream had a clear purpose By killing this woman, you killed the part of you attracted to sin and vice This violent act resolved the internal conflict OK. Let's stop there... As you hear, Carol had no motive for hating Mrs Durer Or to kill her If she had any motives, they were in her subconscious So we need to convince the jury it wasn't Carol... ...but her subconscious - Not so strange Dissociation between conscious and subconscious... ...can push a person to commit a crime unconsciously There are precedents. Like the Barthelmy case Experts' opinion was crucial there The court accepted that Barthelmy killed his sister... ...in a state of total unconsciousness - A case of split personality... - Arthur Barthelmy was acquitted All of which goes to show that this is clearly a liberating dream A dream Of course at that point I thought I needed to explain a dream Neither Carol nor I could know that it was in fact a tragic reality Carol is still convinced it was only a dream Yes, that's understandable The scenes from that night were memorized as being from a dream Reality was mixed with images from her subconscious... ...which in her dream appear as symbols - Like that painting of a swan - Exactly Or her lovemaking with Julia Durer These are symptomatic of a love-hate relationship And maybe those two hippies have the same meaning... But those... that red-haired man. The two hippies on the balcony Witnesses invented by your Ego Why do you say "maybe" those hippies are symbolic? In theory, nothing prevents them from being among the real elements In other words, they witnessed my daughter's crime Dr Kerr Saw it and did nothing Why didn't they try to blackmail her? Can only mean they were working with someone Give me a light please When did Carol talk about it? - When I saw her in the hospital - What an idea... ...keeping her in a mental hospital until her trial In her state, she needs peace and quiet to fully recuperate I highly recommend peace and quiet Or she'll worry herself to death She's already brooding about that other case How did she know about the Barthelmy case? She was working in her father's law firm at the time What's her father's opinion? That if she'd been a man, she'd have been a great lawyer But about this defence strategy? It repulses him. His daughter will become a psychiatric experiment And you, Frank, what do you think? An unfortunate incident for which I'm sorry I assure you that whoever left that door open will be punished But I ask you, Mrs Hammond, to please be less curious Someone was following me One of our male nurses who scared you... Accidentally, of course - No... it wasn't a nurse... - He told me so... No... I saw him before. I know him, I'm certain... Hallucination Carol, there were no red-haired hippies in the park today You're wrong... I saw him Hallucination means seeing things that aren't there But I wasn't thinking about anything at all I was lying down... everything was peaceful... Fine. Let's say that you did see him You saw a man with red hair That doesn't mean anything. A lot of people have red hair It just reminded you of the dream That is the simplest and most reasonable explanation Take it easy, Mrs Hammond It was him, Frank. Really. You have to believe me I want the truth, Frank. How long has this been going on? I met Deborah when I first came to London I was a mess My first marriage had failed She helped me out a lot, not just emotionally. She was the one who begged you to hire me I asked you how long has Deborah been your lover? Two years I know you have a good memory, Frank You remember you were with me the day before the murder... ...when I received a strange call which made me ask you a question Yes. I remember you asked if I was cheating on Carol And then you asked me if I was joking I wasn't joking, Frank - But neither were you - What does that mean? Let's try a theory. See if it works Suppose that particular call came from Julia Durer That she knew about your affair and was blackmailing you You knew that if she talked we'd be finished, like that No-one's blackmailing me No? But let's pretend, just for a second You have to admit it would be a strong motive. Don't you think? For what? To kill Durer? That's absurd! You think so? To kill Julia Durer... ...and place the blame on Carol - Ridiculous! Her prints were on the coat and knife The fur coat and paper knife belong to my daughter Of course her prints are all over them But where's the proof that my daughter left them... ...at the murder scene? And the dream? You're forgetting about the dream So Carol dreamed about the crime exactly as someone committed it? A telepathic dream! Or is Carol, in your opinion, a psychic? The dream... I asked Dr. Kerr to lend me the tapes he recorded with Carol Not to listen to mumbo jumbo about dual personalities... ...but to find something useful And I did find it Listen to this After the hallway all I can remember is a big door opening. And then... ...I don't remember anything It was all so clear yesterday I've told you many times. You must write it down Mrs Hammond, dreams only live a short time in one's memory It was all so clear yesterday I've told you many times. You must write it down Did you know Carol wrote notes about her dreams? - No - Yes you did... ...just as Joan and Deborah knew She wrote them down and kept them in a drawer in her room Any one of you had a chance to read them Who knows how many times you read them You could have read about that exact same dream A dream, Frank, just a dream... ...that someone could have copied and turned into a crime A real crime It makes perfect sense that someone could go... ...from the apartment next door to this one... And on the way, grab a few things... Or three things... ...a paper knife, a fur coat... ...and a white scarf - Exactly We can now explain why she had those brand new boots on She was wearing them in the dream and the murderer put them on her So this person stabbed her three times in the chest ...and planted the paper knife, fur coat and scarf... And also put those black boots on her feet - And all this was in her notes? - You should ask whoever read them Or tell us yourself, if you've read them Don't get in a state. She never kept her notes for long After a few days, she threw them away - Did you read any of them? - All of them Your wife had some messed-up dreams Not now, Joan She wrote that she had sex with Durer Stop it, now! Daddy... if you loved me I wouldn't go with women Not that again... OK - Did you read the papers yet? - No, why? - There's news on the Durer case - Like what? It seems the police are about to make a new arrest A strong suspect So they don't think it's Carol? - Who then? Did they say? - No Fortunately the papers haven't mentioned my name yet YOU? You know, it could be dangerous If something doesn't happen soon To Greenfield - Aren't I going home? - Greenfield is your home Listen to me. You didn't kill Durer, and you have no idea who did If you want to know who did, go to Alexandra Palace, the cellar You'll find a lit candle And bring fifty pounds, that's the price Alexandra Palace, today at 4. Make sure you go, OK? Drop the knife, or the next shot's between the eyes! I'm old, but I've good eyes. I've called the police Hi! Look who's back ls this how you say hello? Get out of the way Did you move here so you could practice? Get out of here. What do you want? To see the redhead, to ask him a few things He's my friend too, you know. I thought he'd be here It looks like he's busier than expected What are you doing? Can you explain it? Painting... Larry, wait for me here Now we know the redhead's real. He's not a ghost He's real and has a good reason to kill Mrs Hammond I should have had her followed... Scour the city, Brandon Check out all men with red hair... - Even the Prince of Wales - All redheads? Good thing we're not in Ireland! - What do you call this painting? - Putrefaction Will you able to sell it? Do you want to buy it? If you promise to do something for me I mind my own business Like the 3 monkeys - see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil - Tell me where the redhead is - You said you were his friend If you tell me where to find him I'll give you twenty for the painting What is it that's so important? I can't tell you over the phone - But what is it? What the redhead said... ...when I was with Carol I didn't think it was important, but now I see it clears you Stay out of this, Joan He must tell the police I'm sure I can persuade him - They always need drug money - Where are you meeting? Woburn Abbey. Soon you won't be a suspect One of our family will be, but not you - You'll be free - Be careful, Joan Don't worry, Dad. I'll call you after I see him I'll have clear proof Julia Durer's killer won't get away with it I'm going to Woburn Abbey now - Be careful - I met the redhead before and... Ma'am, do you know how this story came out? From a phone call made to my father Exactly - May I? - Help yourself A phone call from someone called Mrs Smith... ...who we're now sure was Julia Durer Sorry... Do you think your husband knew about the phone call? It's possible - So you're not sure? - No, inspector Did your father mention it to you? Yes, he did Hello, inspector. Good to see you at Greenfield Why didn't you call me? Your daughter doesn't need a lawyer to talk to me - Did you know her? - It wasn't me Come on, talk! Who gave you the keys to Alexandra Palace? How did you get in? Someone gave you the keys. The security guard? - Was it the security guard? - I don't know him. I don't... But maybe he knows you and he gave you the keys, right? He gave them to you You were planning a wild party in there... He gave them to you for ten pounds... - And a night with your woman - That's right, he told us! - Just because he hates me - Oh yeah? Yeah, yeah, that's right... Say it again! - He hates me - So you do know him? He hates everyone because he's a hunchback How do you know he's a hunchback if you don't know him? He's a hunchback. Everyone knows that. He's a hunchback Come on, tell us the truth If you want the whole story... ...you have to give me what I need - He got what he wanted - He got his fix and he confessed He admits it all He killed Joan... ...and tried to kill your daughter And Durer too... No Not Durer. He didn't kill her Only two people know who committed that crime You and... ...the killer Durer was killed by someone she was blackmailing Someone Durer had pushed to the limit Since she was not blackmailing your son-in-law... ...it was someone else who killed her - Sorry if I misled you - Don't feel bad, sir - Goodbye - Goodbye Why did you convince him that you know who killed Durer? Because I do, Brandon I'm certain, except for one damn contradiction Just one Miss Bennett... Find Dr. Kerr... I want him and everyone else at Durer's house - Talk! - Alright, alright... Hurry UP If you really want me to... Jenny and I were at the old theater and those two women followed us But only the girl talked to us Look at that woman and tell me if you recognize her We see a lot of people. Do you remember her? At Julia Durer's house We've not been there for two weeks Two weeks... It was at night Was it at night you were there? - Night...Yeah - Was it raining? Sure, there was rain and thunder too - Was that the night we saw her? - Yes, that night, exactly That night I wouldn't have noticed her You don't notice with all that acid inside you Yeah, we were tripping on acid... from our head... down to our toes... On LSD, it's like being in another world I could look at the inspector... ...and maybe I see a red dot, or a galloping horse - You remember nothing? - Of course I do Many incredible things I remember... I saw... ...a lizard in a woman's skin! - Disgusting - No... beautiful... amazing! Did you climb up there? Did you sit up there, in the balcony? Maybe. Yes, I think so When I have handcuffs on my tongue gets dry When we talked to that girl, we'd no idea Julia Durer was dead We don't read the papers... What happened then? Later, when we found out, we were scared shitless On drugs, you'll do just about anything Jump off a building believing you can fly I might have killed her and not even realized it Then? When we left here, we were still out of it We didn't see Julia... or anybody else Only those two women knew we'd been here One was the accused Then we heard they were about to arrest someone else... I thought... I thought about... Shutting them both up, permanently And you did. You killed one of them It was easy to kill Joan. She came looking for you... Joan went looking for him to prove you'd not been here Yes, she told me so over the phone If they were in the house during the crime as in your wife's dream... ...Durer was not killed by someone who read her notes It was someone else. There was no set-up, as your father-in-law thought Those brand new boots were a gift from these two We wanted to bring Julia something, and she chose them Dr. Kerr, is it possible to lie during a therapy session? - Lie in what way, Inspector? - Lie by omission Suppose, for example... ...there was someone else here that night... ...And Carol is trying to cover for them. ls that it? Hello?... It's for you, inspector. It's Brandon I'm at Brighton's house. The old man has killed himself He left a note. Says it was him who killed Durer The Coroner's working on it now Inspector, at this point I'd say the case is pretty much closed I had much respect for your father Now I have is much pity - I wish I knew why he did it - But you do know, Mrs Hammond And I do too Remember when I came to Greenfield? I was so close to the truth Your father came in while we were talking He heard all of my questions and all of your answers Do you think your husband knew about the phone call? It's possible - You're not sure? - No, inspector - Did your father mention it to you? - Yes he did It wasn't your father, or he would've told you your husband was there And you didn't know that Your father didn't tell you about that call Nor your husband, or Deborah, or Joan No, it wasn't any of them So who was it then, Mrs Hammond? - I don't remember - There's only one person who knew The only one who could have told you Mrs. Smith... Julia Durer! - I never talked to that woman - Except in your dreams In real life you didn't know Durer and we've no evidence you did But we do have something... Psychoanalysis Dr Kerr's tapes When I heard of your father's suicide I had a question... Dr Kerr, is it possible that a patient comes to you for help... ...but conceals the truth? - It is possible But in such a case the problem will usually still emerge... ...from the patient's subconscious In other words, you were Julia Durer's lover... In real life, Mrs Hammond, not in your dreams You thought you were safe... ...because no one knew about your relationship You visited her that night, knowing she'd be alone And you killed her You saw the hippies only after you'd done it When you saw them, you lost your cool and ran Leaving your things behind, covered with prints You didn't know they were too full of drugs to see anything Effectively, blind witnesses All your errors arise from that They didn't know you, but one day they might have recognized you... ...and given evidence When you saw them, you followed them You had to silence them... ...or lose your defence of temporary insanity That was your hope You invented the dream for Dr Kerr to provide your psychoanalytic alibi The perfect alibi to justify the murder you'd committed You were at the mercy of Durer, a woman without scruples A greedy woman The phone call to your father, was about you, Mrs Hammond It could only be about you You're about to run for election, isn't that so, Mr Brighton? You must avoid scandals I've a story I could sell, to you or a newspaper A dirty little story about someone in your family. Someone close to you... I'll give you the money Your father refused to admit that you could be a killer He couldn't conceive of it and tried to find another answer But fate decreed he would discover the truth He killed himself, but also incriminated himself You murdered Durer and in doing so killed your own father Sadly, you can only be punished for the lesser of your two crimes
