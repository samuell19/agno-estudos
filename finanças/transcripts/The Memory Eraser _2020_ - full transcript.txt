The troops sent a report (Report of death on duty) I was very worried when I was young Mother will lose the motivation to live But I didn't expect the next day My mother completely forgot about the obituary Is the memory messenger doing a good thing? No, I didn’t see it with my own eyes The neighbor's aunt said she saw it She saw a thin man Leaving my house in a gray coat Think it should be the memory messenger the man? How old is he? I don't know this part I think so But fortunately there are memory messengers Otherwise my mother will live more painful Thanks to him, my mother was convinced His son is still alive I was saved because of this This world is full of sadness... Will produce the legend of the memory messenger Is also inevitable Lawyer, why are you so curious about this? Actually I also want to erase some memories real or fake? I am back you are back Hello She is my assistant I'm Ando Nanami I am giessen Are you classmate Liaoyi?

No, I really don’t know this So-yeah Is that person me? No way? I don’t have much impression of the situation at that time But I think of it from time to time No, that person is not you The policeman who arrested the murderer was Shinichi Sugawara. Ah, he is my grandpa clam? Where is your grandpa now? He got dementia and was admitted to the support center in Hiroshima In Hiroshima... I plan to go to Hiroshima clam? -What are you going to do? Ok? Go find my childhood friend That's it Who is that childhood playmate? I can't say that But I will visit your grandpa Then i want to go too You can't go, you have to go to school You have to go to school too I just have to wait for graduation I'll go clam? -clam? clam? I haven't been to Hiroshima anyway Maybe... what will be found You are right, then let's go together You are fine, I want to go back if I can go to Hiroshima Winter vacation is coming soon, you can go back That's right, but I have to go back with you Idiot, it’s weird that childhood playmates are like this What should I do if I am seen? No one here-Huh? You are really different from before Huh? This bench is also green? Xiao Liao-Huh? Child rescued after being caught Really not me? Yes, it's not you Ok Ok Why are you suddenly going back to Hiroshima? Going to investigate something What is the investigation? The case fifteen years ago You... Zhenxi has forgotten, do you still check? I don't think this can go on Shouldn't continue to escape I'm telling you, there are some things that the boat should cross the water without a trace If you don’t see it means it didn’t happen I want to face my past self This is really a good place You can relax, right? How long have you not seen Grandpa? I haven’t seen each other after graduating from high school. It’s been four years. Yes Hope to find some clues about the messenger of memory But Maki...actually knows the case I'm all to blame What? my fault Hello, Mr. Sugawara There are visitors Hey! Hello i am gison Gimori Ryoichi do you still remember me? Gyson Ryoichi? Oh, it's Liaoyi Correct long time no see long time no see (Winning) Grandpa Do you know the memory messenger? Memory messenger? -Correct Mr. Sugawara The case fifteen years ago Do you remember the situation when your granddaughter was rescued? Um i still remember I was still a policeman I want you to talk about what happened at that time What happened to Maki at that time Don't remember it? Do you remember that there were rumors that Is that a good thing the memory messenger did? Liaoyi, that case is simply unbearable. The sacrifices were all little girls But they haven't done anything bad at all This world is so unreasonable Obviously innocent, but suffering Lawyer, are you right? Yes Hiroshima was also hit hard in the war Many people have left painful memories But those painful memories should not be forgotten So as to avoid repeating the same mistakes Having said that, the memories in some people’s minds I still feel so painful that I can't live Liaoyi I have heard people say that the messenger of memory... It's a monster born in this unreasonable world It exists for this world and for people So Maki might actually have seen a memory messenger It's possible Thanks to them, the current Maki Maki now knows about the case I don’t think the pain can go away No matter what happens Human memory will eventually be forgotten and disappear God should use this model To create humans Like me now, my whole person is stupid It's easier to forget Because you forget, you can move on Is it really good to forget like this? Ok? Grandpa The day of the incident It's me who left Maki and ignored me You can't climb it I don't want it, I want to see it too Too dangerous, you are waiting here No! Liaoyi Xiao Liao, wait for me! Xiao Liao, Xiao... Help… I was too scared to help her It’s all my fault that made Maki get involved And i'm too scared Can't tell anyone Silent all the way to now Sorry I am very sorry Liaoyi The retrospective period has long passed Right, lawyer? Yes Just forget about it Sorry Thank you for visiting me specially But I’m sorry, it’s been 15 years The point is that Maki is doing well now Yes Liaoyi, take care of yourself Say hello to your mother for me Thanks auntie, I'm leaving now awesome Xiao Liao, do more Okay, hurry up Go! So beautiful I never thought you grew up in such a peaceful place It would be nice if it was always calm Why do tragic things happen in the world? It's all made by humans Why did God use this model to create mankind? It would be great if humans could be as calm as this landscape People will choose to forget unpleasant memories from my defense What Freud said No matter how sad or painful Humans can survive and live strong What memories do you want the memory messenger to erase? To be correct, that’s not my memory What do you mean? Anyway, I don’t think you should contact... Maki's case If she really has a memory... It's painful enough to be eliminated, what should I do? Do I continue to look for the memory messenger? If Kyoko wants to erase memory Then if I take the memory back, won't it hurt her instead? Will it be like this? Hey? How are you, lawyer? Fortunately, we will take the six o'clock flight back to Tokyo Ms. Zuozuo Cao has seen the Messenger of Memory (Guan Guyao, 17 years old) My childhood friend and I... (Guan Guyao, 17 years old) Guan Guyao's classmates talked real or fake? Is it an extra case? (Continuous Robber Sexual Assault) This is just my subjective inference I'll talk about the details later, you wait for me in the office Ok, no problem good night It's Maki, what's the matter with you? No la I just want to say if I can help really? You are too lonely because Liaoyi is not here, right? A little Did Miss Qihai say anything? Have Zuo Zuocao left an email to her childhood playmate mail? Said she was going to see the memory messenger what? Please use tea Thank you You're welcome Is there anything going on? The memory messenger seems to exist really? Correct That's it But the man’s reaction is really slow Ok? You like Ryoichi, right? You are so keen to observe Sure enough Miss Qihai, do you like Highland Lawyer too? Is Gao Gao's lawyer married? He is divorced and his ex-wife has remarried So he is single now?

Turned out to be like this But even so I still don’t think I should be too close to the memory messenger I don't want to hurt Xiao Liao anymore I think I should stop looking for it This is also for Kyoko's good But you all proposed to her Don't you love her very much? That's why I shouldn't impose my heart on her Don't you want to retrieve her memory? I promise to take the memory back Are you giving up?

He is by our side The following are just my guess Kyoko... It should be after you proposed to her Accident The fright she received is unimaginable So I can only ask the memory messenger to erase that memory And memories related to you So that I can be saved why? Why do you know this? If Kyoko really has an accident Then I can understand why she wants to erase the memory But why even erase the memory related to me? She must be... Experienced pain that we could not imagine She loves you Love so much that I can't forgive myself how is this possible… This is just my guess Can you go help me to verify it? Verify? Replace me and find out the truth Lawyer, you... Why are you so persistent to the messenger of memory? I want to ask him to help me erase my daughter's memory What do you mean by this? I have been divorced for two years Daughter has a new father Forget me, also for the good of my daughter's future and also When i die I don't want my daughter to leave sad memories It's ridiculous You are really selfish I never think that erasing memory is a good thing Can you find him then?

This is not what his daughter wanted is it? That's it What will happen in the future, no one knows This is true I want my daughter to live with the sadness of her father's death Will be painful But sadness is painful, but it must exist I do not know either I think when Mr. Gaoyuan accepted that he was about to die I have to think about his daughter, it’s more painful When i die I don't want my daughter to leave sad memories Doctor Fukuoka, do you know Sasao?
