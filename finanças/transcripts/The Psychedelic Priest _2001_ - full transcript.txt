It's a Sunday, God's day. How should you be spending this time? In honoring your creator, that's how, in doing his work, not lying on your backs and dosing yourselves, spoiling the body he gave you with pot, acid and worse, wasting your hours with music fit only for copulation. This lazy life is fine, but how are you prepared for eternity? 'I wonder if that's how I look to my students, 'an outdated, unchanging relic of another time, 'standing up on a soapbox, preaching to them. 'What would have happened, I wonder, if I'd just put away the soapbox, and... 'and sat down and talked to them, like a friend.' Uh-oh, here comes the father. Looks like we're in for more of that religious crap. Put it out. I really don't know where to begin, because... you've broken nearly every rule I can think of. To start with, all four of you skipped classes today. And I can still smell it. I mean, you're not fooling anybody. Sir. Is this a bribe? Look, I know what you people think, but it's... it's no real fun for me to hop on you all the time. And I'm not the one who has something to lose, because I already have my high school diploma. I have a college diploma. That little piece of paper is going to mean a great deal to you someday. You may not realize it right now, but it will. I don't know what to tell you about the medical aspects of it. And I know you've all got good minds. That's the waste of the whole thing. Why would you want to ruin your mind? Well... Thanks for the Coke. And I wanna see all of you in the classroom tomorrow. - I dug what you just did, man. - What do you mean? - I saw you drop acid in his Coke. - Yeah, he's really gonna fly.

Yeah, I hope it's my lucky day. What's that supposed to mean? Well, the last guy I got a ride with was going to LA, too. It's still two days from here, and uh... he wanted me to spend the evening in his motel room. I just wanted to sleep in the car. I didn't have any money or anything. So here I am, in the middle of nowhere. And I just don't want it to happen again. I haven't been staying in a motel. I've just been finding a good place beside the road and camping out with a sleeping bag. And I have an extra one, if you want it. Did you get a good night's sleep? Yes, I did. Thanks. Listen, I've been thinking about your traveling across the country. Sounds pretty dangerous. I mean... I don't think I'd want to do it by myself. Yeah, it can get kinda hairy at times. Years ago, this, uh... old man picked me up. We were driving along, talking and laughing. We were really having a good time. He had this real old pickup truck, and, uh... we had a flat tire, so we hopped out and started to fix it. Bunch of other cars came by and I could have gotten a ride with somebody else, but I don't know. We'd just been having such a cool time, I decided to stick with him. After we got it fixed, we decided to take one of those little side roads up to the hills and just look at the valley. When we got up there, I couldn't believe what a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde he turned into. He just started attacking me. Didn't you try to defend yourself? Sure, I defended myself. I kicked and I screamed and I did what I could, considering he had a knife on me. And he raped me. Oh, wow, you know... Now I can understand why you were so uptight when I picked you up yesterday. Yeah. Mm... Then I had to worry about being pregnant. And, wow... What would I do with a col... What? I couldn't hear you.

I was on a real bummer. And I just wonder why I still trip. I felt like everything was there for me to try at least once. One night, this guy and I thought it'd be really kicky to go out to the graveyard and trip. It was so beautiful. We lay there by the moon. All different colors. And the grass was so fine. Our heads were really together, and I just... trusted him so much. I rolled over to tell him something. And he wasn't there. Then I called for him and he didn't answer. 'And I was really hallucinating now. 'I started looking behind gravestones for him. 'Everywhere. 'I just couldn't believe it. 'It was my first trip. 'I was really peaking. 'And he just left me. 'And I couldn't hear. Everything was getting in my way. 'All I could hear was crickets or leaves. 'I wanted it to be quiet so I could hear. 'And I screamed for him. 'And I just screamed and screamed and screamed. 'And he never answered. 'So I started clawing. Crazy dead people! 'I clawed and clawed. 'I had to get in there to see if he was there. 'I had to get out of there, so I started running. 'For anything, for anywhere. 'I was only 15 years old. 'My first trip.' And I just... trusted him so much. Oh, God, what a bummer! Hey, man, uh... I'm really sorry if I bummed you out last night. It was really a bad trip. No, you didn't really bum me out, I... I have been thinking about it a lot, though, because... I don't know, it keeps going around in my head. I guess primarily because I had kind of a similar experience one time. When you're dealing with people, it's really more of a bummer sometimes than it is with drugs. Not so far as the acid thing is concerned, I mean... any acid trip, even a good one, is a bum trip so far as I'm concerned. Hey, you want a ride? Are you alright? There's something wrong with her. Honey, what's wrong? Oh, God, John, she's gonna have a baby. Come on. Easy. Easy. Oh. There's no hospital around here. What are we going to do with her? I heard there is a doctor living in a truck just a couple of miles from here. Will you take me there, please? Hey, can you guys help us? We have a girl here who's gonna have a baby. Sure. Hey man, we need some help. Come on. Easy now. Easy. Everything's gonna be OK. Easy now. Easy. Move that stuff out the way. Easy now. Easy. Come on, lay down. Come on now, just relax. Just relax, you're gonna be OK. Just relax now, I'm a doctor. It's gonna be very easy. You're gonna have a beautiful baby. Just relax now. It's not gonna hurt. Just relax, take it easy. We gotta get these pants off first. Come on. Relax. Relax now. There we go. OK? Alright, now, here's what... Somebody get me a knife and heat the blade up. Relax, relax. Now, put your hands right up here. That's nice. Can you feel it? Now, that's what I want you to do now. Listen closely now. Just relax. When you feel it coming, just take a deep breath and push. A deep breath. Every time you feel it, just take a deep breath and push. Relax now. Come on, take a deep breath. Breathe in, breathe out. In, out. And when you feel it, you just push. Relax. Everything's gonna be OK. You wait till you see this baby. It's gonna be beautiful. Just relax now. Come on. Are you ready? Ready? Come on. Take a deep breath. OK now push. Push, push. That's a girl. Relax now, relax. Come on, now. Come on, now. Come on, now. Come on, now. Alright? Push! Just relax now. Everything's OK. Don't worry about it. It's coming along just fine. OK, push now. Push! Push! Push! Push! Come on, it's coming. Just relax now. Push! Push! Come on! Isn't he a beautiful baby? You have a beautiful little boy. Wow, man! Hey, look, uh... The baby's gonna need a little wiping down. - Think you can handle it? - Oh, sure, I'd love to help. Good girl. That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my whole life. There's nothing to it, man. You know, childbirth is the most natural thing in the world. I'm just glad you were here, because if you hadn't been... I'm sure she'd have died and the baby too. Oh, man, you know, she's gonna be just fine. Don't worry about it. Actually, I just now realized that I don't even know her name. She was just lying beside the highway when we picked her up. Lying beside the highway? Well, don't worry, we'll take good care of her here. Funny, I just... You know, you're the first hippy doctor I've ever known. I'm not a hippy, man, I'm just getting away from it all. You know how it is in the city with everybody rushing back and forth and ploughing their way to the top, you know? Everyone's in a hurry to get somewhere and they don't have time to stop and see things around them and feel things around them, man. I mean, they're like machines. You know, a man could be lying in the street, dying, right now and no one would even stop to see if they could help. You know, man, I was afraid I might become like one of them. Yeah, but don't you think you could do more for those people if you were down there instead of up here? That's a good question. Can you believe somebody like that giving up when there are so many people who need his help? Right. Go find out where his head's at. Hey, man, I've got to ask you a question. What are you doing up here when there's so many people who need you? Let me tell you a story. Thirty-five of us just completed our internship. We lived, ate and slept together. This was in a northern city, by the way. Anyway, guess who wasn't invited. Oh, come on, man, you're putting me on. No. And you wanna know the excuse they gave? They said they thought I was in surgery. But you know what? I don't have any feeling of animosity for them, because I understand them, even though they don't understand me. So, I turned down the residency. I can dig it, man. Now, you didn't really turn it down. You know, what they didn't seem to realize was that, uh... I really wasn't interested in the residency. You see, I'm really interested in cancer research. You know, I know there's no money in it, but I figure that maybe some of my black might rub off on one of them test tubes and I just might get lucky. You know, if I can find just one thing that would help that child to grow up without some of the problems that we face, then I'd feel I've really accomplished something in this life. Well, if you wanted to go into cancer research, how come you were up on the hill? Well, I had to get my head together. But, you know, now I... I really know where it's at. That's why I'm going back. You know, I just realized something. I think I'm about to starve to death. Me too. I could really dig some food. Why don't we stop at a restaurant? It might be a little complicated in this part of the country. What kind of complications, man? I think it'd be best if you brought the food out to me. With us, it's gonna be one way, Ed. We're all gonna go in and we're gonna eat together or we're gonna sit out here in the car and eat. I wanna go in the restaurant. Right, man, we all go in the restaurant, OK? OK. OK, it's your funeral. Might even be mine. Looks like we got ourselves a couple of hippies and a watermelon eater. I wonder where they got the car from. They probably stole it. But who was driving? - The nigger, naturally. - Oh, I know they stole it, then. Come on, let's put him in the can. Guess it's around back here somewhere. If you're gonna go first, make it fast, huh? Hey, boy! Hey, black boy, you! Come here! Whose car is that over there? That's John's car. Let me see identification. What do you wanna see? My honorable discharge, my social security? Alright, just get over there. Hey, man, what's wrong? You just keep your mouth shut, whitey, and stay out of this, you understand? Hey, boy, was you through here last year? No, this is my first time in this part of the country. - Do you know a girl named Jenny? - No. Look, you guys, just tell us what's wrong and leave us alone. Why don't you tell us what you want? Hey, man, what's wrong? You just keep your mouth shut. You can shut up, too! And you come with me. Where are you taking him? Come on, we gotta get him out on bail. - It won't do any good with them. - I guess we can at least try. In the name of the Father... and the Son and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Si vives, ego te absolvo in nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. What did you do to him? Well, he tried to escape. He jumped out of the car. He ran across the street and a car hit him. ♪ I know ♪ For the Bible tells me so ♪ Little ones ♪ To him belong ♪ They all weep but he is strong ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪ Yes, Jesus loves me ♪ The Bible tells me so ♪ You sound very sad. Are you thinking about Ed? Yeah, I was thinking about him. I've never really cared what happened to a person after they died, but with Ed I do. Oh, it makes me so damn mad when I think about how those cops treated him. There must be something we can do. Well, he did try to escape, you know. And it's not as if they dragged him right out of the car and tried to shoot him or something. Yeah, that's what they tell us, but I wonder what really happened. When you cried for Ed, I realized that... some men are capable of compassion. This may really sound strange, I mean, particularly under the circumstances, but... if through Ed's death you've reached a new realization that you just have to treat everybody as individuals, then maybe it wasn't all in vain. And as for Ed's being dead, I mean, he's not really dead. It reminds me of something I heard one time. When a person dies, the physical side of him does die, but the spirit never dies. The spirit begins an ascension through various levels of spiritual purification. And, uh... along its journey, it, uh... Should it encounter any difficulties with which it's incapable of coping, it can... it can call for aid and comfort from spirits already having attained a higher level of purification. And it continues its journey until it reaches the highest, the final level, which is a state of oneness with God. And that's where all religious concepts, Mohammedism, Christianity, Buddhism, even atheism, all come together. I think that makes it a real philosophy of hope. I'd really like to believe that. It'd make me feel better to think that Ed was some place where the color of his skin didn't matter. You're very quiet. Is there anything wrong? I was thinking about how stupid I have been. In not meeting people and accepting them as the people that they are. But mostly because of the way you treated me. It's like you've held out your hand to everyone. And... you've given to them. And you've given so much to me. I want to take your hand, because... I love you. I haven't just... fallen in love with someone. I've learned to love you. Because you've taught me what real love is. What do you know about love? What do you know about me? You don't know anything about me, and I don't know anything about you. We just met a short time ago, and already you're in love, huh? It's just a new emotion you found some place and now you tack a label on it called "love". You know, all my life I've had people running my life for me, and I'm sick and tired of it. First it was my mother. Then I wasted 11 years of my life. Just who do you think you are anyway? We had a perfect thing going, and now you have to spoil it with this. Look, I'm... I'm not trying to hurt you, but... there's just no place in my life for this kind of relationship. No place at all. Sunny? You asleep? No. Listen, I feel really ashamed of myself because I lied to you. I mean, not about what I told you about myself, but what I didn't tell you. I told you I was a school teacher, but... I didn't also tell you that I was a Catholic priest. You mean... You mean you're a priest right now? Well, that's something I'm trying to figure out right now. And... if you can just give me some time, Sunny, maybe we can work things out. You've got a real good excuse, John. Every man has a real good excuse. Listen, it's true, Sunny.

OK, I'll get a man on it now, I mean today. Tell me, did she ever mention any friends that she had she might like to visit, or any places she'd like to go to? Yeah, uh... Let's see, there was either a girlfriend or a relative who lived in Encino and works in some department store there. That's good.

He'll take care of everything. Praise the Lord. I first thank the Lord for my salvation. What dope did for me, it made me a real heavy person, a deep philosopher. So I totally tripped out. Finally I gave up and I meditated for about ten days. I was laying there, staring at walls, and I knew that there was nothing worth living for in this life and society was falling apart. I couldn't see the nine-to-five jobs or routine like that, not because I was into revolutions or anything, but because of the pure fact that there was no life. I'd lived in a lot of places, and I found no peace, happiness or anything in my life. My sin caught up with me. I was scared out of my mind. I've never been that scared. It's like no fear that human fear will ever give you. I remembered that God said heaven and earth shall pass away, everything was snakes and bugs. Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my word will not pass away. And I pulled my Bible out of my pocket and I started to read it. And as soon as I opened the Word, on the very first page, I saw the word "Christ". And it shone out of there like a... like a beacon. Just went... pshhh. And everything else was snakes and horrible things. The people's faces, like... Their hair was growing. They looked like nothing but devils. And the word "Christ" stood out like the brightest beacon of light in the world. And I knew that that was it. I had no idea why at the time. But now I know exactly why. Jesus put me up here.
