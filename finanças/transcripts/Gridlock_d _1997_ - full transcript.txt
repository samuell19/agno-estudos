I'm thinking about getting a penis implant. Get the fuck out of here. I'm fucking serious. They have do-it-yourself penis implants now.

We're at the hospital. Everything will be okay. May I see a doctor now'? One moment, sir. I need a Social Security number and a Medicaid number. Which I assume she has since you put "yes" in this box. A photo ID and the address of her next of kin. MY lady's dying here. We need a fucking doctor now and you want numbers? If I'd known that shit, I'd have written it down. I need a fucking doctor! Don't use that language with me. You don't know me. Where the hell do you get off talking to me like some tramp'?! Nobody talks to me like that at my job. And you know what? I'll let the bitch die. What is wrong, Gloria? That man has lost his mind. The girl just O.D.'d. She's been out for an hour.

What's Wrong? You could have joined us. You know I can't get it up in a crowd. Did you read my new poem? I'm doing it tonight. No, not yet. I always knew I was a woman, even when I was a boy. What are you Watching? Man had a sex change, but he's a lesbian. What? A man who had a sex change, but now he's a lesbian. Wait a minute. A man becomes a woman. But he doesn't do it to sleep with a man as a woman, he does it to sleep with a Woman as a woman. Right. A guy cuts off his dick to sleep with a Woman without the right equipment. Right. He could've saved a lot of money by giving Women head and keeping his dick. But he wouldn't have been a woman. Excuse me, I forgot that part. So your baby's father is also your baby's cousin? That's not right. There are some crazy motherfuckers in this world. Where's my veggie burger'? I don't know. - I don't know. That was a veggie burger'? It tasted like meat. You bastard. You ate it'? Which of you fucks ate my veggie burger'? That's not funny. I'm the vegetarian. Buy your own fucking food. Cookie, you are so full of shit.

There you go with that pig Latin. It ain't pig Latin. It's bop. From bebop. You take the first letter put "iz" behind it, then add the rest of the word. Like "saying" would be "sizaying".

You'll say it to the wrong person and... I swear to God, man. Don't look up. That's the guy you hit. Those are definitely his plates. So go back and kick his ass. Fuck you.

Otherwise, it takes six Weeks. I ain't taking no damn HIV test. Hold still, please. I didn't want to do this, but what can I do'? Press the cotton on that spot, please.

How you doing today, beautiful'? Fine. May I help you'? We'd like to apply for temporary Medicaid cards. Are you on welfare? No. You must be on welfare to get Medicaid. The only reason we need Medicaid is so we can get into a rehab program today. That's still going to take four to six Weeks. We don't have four to six Weeks, ma'am. Next. The problem is, it has to got to Lansing and back. It takes time. Temporary Medicaid cards are issued only for medical necessities. Why is everything such a hassle with you guys'? I need help and you give me bullshit about medical fucking necessities. It is a fucking necessity for me to get into detox. Before I kill some-motherfucking-body.

Give me that. - What the fuck'? Give it here. Me and Stretch will do it. I want to try some. It's New Year's Eve. Get out of here. You never do blow. He gave it to me. It's mine. I just want to try some. This shit is fucked up. Who do you think it was'? Could have been any-fucking-body. Why do you still use a spoon to cook your dope'? A lot of the shit's evaporating. Use a vitamin cap or a juice cap. Why'? Aluminum conducts heat better than steel. No shit'? Copper's better, but I don't know Where you'd find a copper top. I'd use aluminum. Fuck that aluminum shit.

No. What's your name'? - Bob. Bob'? - Yeah. Do you have a last name'? Yeah. But most people just call me Bob. You think this is a joke'? Johnson. I can't hear you. Robert Johnson. What about you'? - John Doughman. You live here'? - We came to visit a friend. Was I talking to you'? Okay, get out of here. Lizook dizown. Hey! What's the name'? The name of your friend here. Sharon Barnes. Third floor. See, we have fundamental differences in our belief systems. You believe somehow things will work out. I know the World is fucked and nothing will work out. Don't put your arm on me. You smell disgusting. Is that puke on your pants? No, that ain't puke. It sure as fuck smells like it. Fuck you. What's the address? Medicaid, 1st and Jefferson. We're standin on 1st and Jefferson. I don't see no fucking Medicaid. Sorry, no spare change. I just wanted directions. Just some fucking directions. Would you come on'? Come the fuck on. 50 years ago. This was probably a badass building. - Yeah. How you doing'? Medicaid, please? Three lefts, a right and a left. 8th floor. Two fights, two Mafia and a fight'?

Sir, we only do referrals here now. 18063 Grasher. So, I said to him: "Help? I don't need help. I got a job." I said: "Wait. Hold on" But then he had to say something. I don't know Why you even put up with him. Is there anything else'? This fucking country is falling apart. People don't give a shit. Especially people in government jobs. They sit on their fucking asses and Won't help you. And if somehow they do help, they give you attitude like you're wasting their time. Excuse me, it's your job. My tax dollars pay for your fucking wages. You piece of shit. I'm your boss. Sometimes I want to choke the shit out of them. Know what I mean'? Do I. - Don't hassle me 'cause you hate your job. Least you have one. A lot of people can't get jobs. Even if you do get a job, there's no security. My friend's cousin's sister's brother worked for the same company for 20 years. Then they fired his fucking ass. Excuse me. Hey, I'm talking to you. What? - You have something that is ours. Is that fucking so'? Yes. And we would like it back. Sorry. I only bring one pair of pantyhose with me. That's funny. Come here, you motherfuckers. Get in the goddamn car. Officers. Officers, I am so glad to see you. We can't find the, uh...

You know, you guys are really great guys. I think cops get a bum rap sometimes. Here you are, helping citizen with directions and employment information. You guys are great. Your profession. Do we hear about guys like you'? Nice cops, the ones that care'? No. All we hear about are the racists ones ones who use excessive force, who are on the take, the ones who shoot their wives. Never the ones who truly serve and protect. Protect and serve. - Absolutely. You guys are my kind of guys. You're nice cops. - Yeah, thanks. You're the second set of nice people we met today. You guys and those guys. You see those guys'? Those guys are really nice guys, too. We asked them for directions. They didn't know Where Social Security was, but they offered to drive us. They are really nice guys. Well, thanks for everything. So, it's just around the corner on the left'? Yeah. - Thanks again. I'm going to look into this. What the fuck was that? That was fucking great. Did you see those motherfuckers take off'? What do you think they meant by "give us our shit back"? Probably the fucking dope. What I can't fucking understand is how do we leave Mud's go downtown, come out of Social Security and have two motherfuckers waiting for us'? Doesn't that seem a bit strange? Who gives a fuck'? We lost them. Let's just get to Medicaid. If it don't happen today, it'll never happen. It's two blocks that way. What time is it'? Four-thirty. Let's stop and get breakfast. This is Bill Jacobs with the evening news. Knock, knock. Knock, knock. What you like, Governor'? What kind of sandwiches you got'? What? - What kind of sandwiches you got'? A vicious double homicide was discovered near Grand River and Hamilton Avenues. Here is newscaster Alexia Cruz with resident Patty Robinson. It don't make no sense. Let someone cal! about gunshots in a rich neighborhood A cheeseburger with everything. What? - A cheeseburger with everything. How about you, Senator? Give me a B.L.T.!

This is Alexia Cruz, Prime Action News. Back to you, Bill. What'll we do'? - They killed Cee-Cee. They fucking killed Cee-Cee. What the fuck do we do'? We have to get off the streets. We'll go in here and talk to someone about getting into a program. We'll tell them whatever we have to. But we get off the fucking streets today. Okay? Fill this out and bring it back to me. Fill this out and bring it back to me. Could you put the cigarette out'? Fill this out and bring it back to me. Melvin Goldman. Mr. Melvin Goldman. I had a homeboy in high school named Melvin Goldman. I would freak out if he got up and walked to the counter. Old crazy ass Melvin Goldman. First time I got high was with Melvin. He was a rich fucker. His parents had everything. Always six or eight of us ghetto fuckers at his house. One night we were there, his parents were out of town. We were smoking, playing pool drinking some 151 proof rum, one of us got someone at the liquor store to buy for us. A guy comes in with some White powder "Who wants to try it?" I didn't know what the shit was. At this point, all I'd ever clone was maybe smoke a joint once. We was young and stupid and it was fun. So we said fuck it and tried some. Everybody got sick as clogs. The were running around, throwing up. And for me For me, it was like going back to the womb. I never felt such peace. I was home. I was sixteen fucking years old. At first, we'd just get fucked up on the Weekends. Then.â€œ Life is funny, ain't it'? I don't think this was my parents' dream for me. You're ridiculous. Get rid of the dope and I'll finish this. - Yeah. Mr. Ezekial Whitmore, please. Ezekial Whitmore. Yeah. Unfortunately, it's almost five. We're not giving out any more appointments. I'll stamp your application. This way, tomorrow you can come directly to me and not Wait in line. I can't Wait till then, sir. My friend and I have to get into detox today. We've been going from office to office all day. I understand, but an appointment would be all I could give you now. And you still would't get emergency Medicaid today. You'd have to return in a week to be interviewed. Once they reviewed your case, they'd notify you by mail, which takes a month. So whoever said I could get Medicaid in a day was lying. That is correct. Either that, or they were misinformed. The only Way to get on is if you're HIV infected. But we'd need a letter from your doctor. I took an HIV test today at New Center Clinic. They said I could get Medicaid sooner. When will your results be in'? - Tomorrow. Like I said, come back tomorrow. Come to my desk with the results and you Won't have to Wait in line. Yeah, thanks. Oh, shit. Stretch?! - How'd it go'? Fucking five-O just came in. We have to get out of here. Give me a minute. You know how people said we could get Medicaid in a day'? That's a drama. You have to be HIV positive to get it. Ain't that some shit'? - I'm HIV positive. You Okay'? I never mentioned it because I didn't know what you'd say. I mean, I always used my own works. Does Cookie know? No. We never got far enough for me to have to tell her. You're the first person I ever told. What the fuck are you doing'? I can't believe you. I told you to get rid of the dope. Flush the dope down the toilet without doing any'? Fuck that. - Five-O! Freeze. Come out with your hands up! Now. Wiping, wiping. - Get out of there, fool! Now. Come here, junkies. Come here. Against the wall. Turn around. Do you have any fucking Weapons on you'? You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say Three-one-eleven. We have a situation. I fought in the goddamn war. Frag the whole goddamn government. They can't take me out like this. Is this my homecoming! Is this my fucking ticker-tape parade? Well, I can't see it. Incoming! Freeze, sir. Excuse me'? Call your dog or I'll have to shoot him. I said, call your dog or he's dead. Nixon, here. Here, Nixon. Good boy. Yes, good Nixon. Name, rank, serial number. Name, rank, serial number. Hi. You still got the dope'? - I flushed it clown the toilet. Freeze. The same guys. You still don't think that's strange? - Okay, it's a little strange. If they keep shooting, they're going to get lucky. You still have time to go back and kick his ass. I'll get him later. Number 97. Last call. B-ninety-seven. Ninety-seven. Get up, my man. Suspects in alley, 6th and Lafayette. I have to stop. Come on. Up here. Freeze! Both of you. Turn around. Let go of the weapon. Let it go. Give me your arm. We have to do something. I don't want to die here. You Won't die. It's just a flesh wound. You think so'? It looks like I'm bleeding to death. No. You'll be all right. Okay, it's getting dark. This is what we'll do. I want you to stab me. What? - Stab me. I ain't gonna fucking stab you. If We're in the emergency room, We're off the street. In the hospital, we can kick. Why are you tripping? I'm the one being out. Besides, it's a pocketknife. I'm not comfortable with that. Come on, Stretch. We can't be out here all night-. You're bleeding. You have to go anyway. Where'? - Where what? Where do I stab you'? Where do you think is best'? If I stab you in the stomach, I might hit some organs. You're right. Not in the stomach. What about the arm'? Nah, too wimpy. I could stab you in the back. No, you could fucking paralyze me. Not the back. Okay, my liver is on the left. My stomach. My liver's on the left. My kidneys are back there. And my stomach's... Or are my kidneys on the left'? I think the stomach's left. My lungs are here. I don't want a punctured lung. What if I stab you between organs? Like maybe between Where the stomach and kidneys meet. Yeah. Let's do it. Right here'? - Yeah. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go into the light. Which side'? - This side. There'? - Yeah. Come on, let's do it. Ahh, that fucking hurts. Fuck!

Land of the free and home of the enslaved to the concept of time six hours, 22 minutes, 3 seconds I've been waiting in this county line by the looks of the gridlock outside. It's got to be about three thirty-nine. Everybody rushing from place to place the looks on their face are no different to mine. Both of us look like we just worked a nine to five. What they're rushing for is my interest. Rushing through traffic jam to get to emergency room traffic jam. That's supposed to be a free clinic. Only to hear that you have or if you don 't have insurance it ain't nothing but survival of the fittest. So what are they rushing for? Damn, this man at the window is slow. The concept of time has us all fucked. And on top of that Life ain't nothing but a traffic jam. Life is too short, feel trapped hoping I 'm not caught, watch my back. Lost in traffic heartless and tragic Don't want to get my ass kicked Sol walk in this mindless state Dope make me fee! this way I tel! you Life is a traffic jam. I'm stuck.

Tell me if you fee! me. Life is a traffic jam. Sincerely. Stretch your mouth won't feed your soul. 3 voices you can't control. Remember, life is a traffic jam. Life is a traffic jam.
