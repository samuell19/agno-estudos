Look, Norma, your dear children are at your knees. Be moved by pity for them even if you've no pity for yourself. Ah, why do you want to undermine my steadfastness with soft sentiments? No hopes and no dreams remain to a heart close to death. Look at your dear children. Why do you want to undermine my steadfastness? Do as I ask! Do as I ask! Oh, leave me! - He loves you. - He repents already. - And you? - I used to love him. Now my heart feels only friendship for him. O dear girl! What do you wish? To give you back your rights or else I swear by heaven and man to hide myself with you for ever. Yes, you have won. Embrace me. I find in you a friend again. Yes, you will have me as a friend until your last hour. The world is large enough to be a shelter to both of us. I shall set my face firmly against the shame which destiny may bring as long as I feel your heart beating on mine. A furtive tear welled up in her eye. Those carefree girls she seemed to envy. Why should I look any further? She loves me, yes, I can see it. To feel for just one moment the beating of her dear heart! To blend my sighs for a little with hers! Heavens, I could die. I ask for nothing more. Where can I fly to now? Where can I hide my terrible torments? Like those songs, bitter tears echo in my soul. O Elvira, for whom I longed, forever I have lost you! Without hope and love what remains in this life? Ah, for ever I have lost you, flower of love, oh, my hope. Ah, life from now on will be full of sorrow! When for years I wandered at the mercy of fortune I defied misfortune and suffering in the hope of your love. Beautiful, blessed dream of peace and contentment, oh, change my destiny, oh, change my heart. Oh! What torture in days of sorrow is the sweet memory of a tender love. Chaste goddess, as you cast a silver light on these ancient and sacred trees turn your beautiful face to us, unclouded and unveiled. Temper, O goddess, the hearts of these ardent spirits. Temper also their audacious zeal. Spread upon the earth that peace which you let reign in heaven. Ah, come back to me, as in the days of our first, devoted love, and I shall defend you against the whole world. Ah, come back to me with the beauty of your clear gaze and I shall find life, homeland and heaven on your breast. Ah, come back to me as you were then when I gave you my heart. I was born into pain and tears. I suffered while my heart kept silent. But by magic, in the flower of my years, in a sudden flash, my fate has changed. No, dry your eyes. Why be afraid? Come to me. A daughter, a sister, a friend, I shall be all these to you. I shall not sit alone by the fire, singing sadly any more. My long days of suffering were a dream, a game. 'Tis he! He himself! The Infante! My dear Rodrigo! Your Highness! Is it really you I clasp to my bosom? O my prince! Heaven it is that has sent you to me in my suffering. - My consoling angel! - My beloved prince! The hour has struck: the Flemish people call you! You must help them: appoint yourself their saviour! But what do I see? How pale, how troubled you look! Misery flashes across your brow! You are silent! You sigh! Your heart is sad! Carlos, share your tears, your grief, with me. My saviour, my brother, my faithful friend, let me weep on your bosom! Pour out your cruel torment into my heart! Do not close yours to me! Speak! You wish it? Then learn of my misfortune and of the terrible shaft that has pierced my heart! I love... with a guilty love... Elisabeth! Your stepmother! Great heavens! How pale you've become! You turn your eyes to the ground! Woe is me! Even you, Rodrigo, do you abandon me? No, Rodrigo loves you still! I can swear it to you. You are suffering? Then the whole universe is as nothing to me! - O my Rodrigo! - My prince! Your secret has not yet been discovered by the King? No! Then obtain his sanction to leave for Flanders. Silence your heart. Yours will be work worthy of you. Now among an oppressed people learn to become a king! I will follow you, brother. Hark! The doors of the sanctuary are opening. Philip and the Queen will soon arrive. Elisabeth! Beside me, strengthen your wavering spirit! Once more your star will shine serenely in the sky! Pray heaven for the valour of the strong! O God, who wished to instil love and hope in our souls, thou must kindle in our hearts a desire for liberty. We swear to live and die together. On earth, in heaven, thy goodness can unite us. O God, who wished to instil love and hope in our souls, thou must kindle in our hearts a desire for liberty. We will live and die together! Our last breath will be a cry: Liberty! We will live and die together! Our last cry shall be: Liberty! Come, Mallika, the creepers in flower already cast their shadow upon the sacred stream that flows, dark and peaceful, awakened by the clamorous song of the birds! O mistress! This is the hour when I see you smile, the blessed hour when I may read Lakmé's ever secret heart! A dense vault - the jasmine entwines with the rose, flowering bank and fresh morning together call us. Oh, let us glide along, drifting with the fleeting current on the shimmering wave. With a languid hand let us reach the bank where the spring sleeps and the birds sing. Dense vault and white jasmine together call us! But I know not what sudden fear takes hold of me: when my father goes alone to their accursed town I tremble with fright! That the god Ganessa may protect him let us go as far as the pool where the snowy-winged swans disport themselves happily and gather the blue lotus flowers. Yes, near the snowy-winged swans let us go and gather the blue lotus flowers. A dense vault - the jasmine entwines with the rose, flowering bank and fresh morning together call us. Oh, let us glide along, drifting with the fleeting current on the shimmering wave. With a languid hand let us reach the bank where the spring sleeps and the birds sing. Dense vault and white jasmine together call us! From the depths of the holy temple decked with flowers and gold a woman appears. I can still see her! The kneeling crowd watches her in astonishment and murmurs softly: Behold, it is the goddess who rises out of the darkness and reaches out to us! Her veil is raised. O vision, O dream! The crowd is on its knees! Yes, it is she! It is the goddess, the loveliest and most beautiful of all. Yes, it is she! It is the goddess who is stepping down among us! Her veil is raised and the crowd is on its knees! She makes her way through the crowd! Her long veil already hides her face from us. Alas, my eyes follow her in vain! She is gone! She is gone! But what is this strange ardour suddenly kindled in my soul! What is this new fire that consumes me! Your hand forces mine away! Your hand forces mine away! Love is taking possession of our hearts and turning us into enemies! No! - Nothing must part us now! - No, nothing! Let us swear to remain friends! Yes, it is she! It is the goddess who has come to reunite us. And, true to my promise, I will cherish you like a brother! It is she! It is the goddess come to reunite us. Yes, let us share the same fate! Let us remain staunch friends until death! At your voice my heart unfolds as flowers unfold to the dawn's kisses. But, beloved, the better to dry my tears, let your voice speak again! Tell me that you are returning to Delilah for ever; repeat to my loving ear your former vows, those words I loved! Ah, respond to my tenderness, fill me with rapture. As ears of corn are seen rippling in the gentle breeze so my heart quivers, ready to be comforted by your voice that is so dear to me. The arrow is less swift at carrying death than is your lover at flying into your arms. Ah, respond to my tenderness, fill me with rapture. Samson! I love you! Oh, could I only refuse to credit what my eyes have seen! If heaven and earth, if mortal kind and angels should all swear that she is not guilty "You lie," I should have to answer. "You all are lying." This is her writing! Such perfidy! A soul so black, so false! My father knew her all too well! But then, what of her vows, her hopes, her joy, her tears, her grief? All lies, deceit, betrayal! When at evening in the calm radiance of a starry sky she turned her loving gaze upon me in the clear air and I felt my hand clasped in hers... Alas, she betrayed me. Those times when in silent ecstasy I hung upon her lips and she would say with the voice of an angel, "I love you alone," so that it seemed that the empyrean disclosed its glories to my soul... Alas, she betrayed me! I am again happy if I can embrace you. I have saved you! We must say farewell here. O Carlos! For me the last day has come: we shall never see each other again. May God reunite us in heaven, he who rewards the faithful. I see tears in your eyes. Why do you weep so? No, take heart. Happy is the last breath of him who will die for you. Carlos, listen: your mother will be waiting for you at Yuste tomorrow. She knows everything. Oh, I am weakening! Carlos, give me your hand! I shall die, but happily, for thus I have been able to preserve a saviour for Spain! Ah, do not forget me! Do not... forget me! You were destined to reign and I to die for you. Ah, I shall die, but happily, for thus I have been able to preserve a saviour for Spain! Ah, do not forget me! The ground is giving way under me. Give me... your hand... Oh, save Flanders! Carlos, farewell! Woe is me! O gentle maid! O sweet face suffused with the light of the rising moon! In you I recognize the dream I'd like to dream forever! My soul is already a-throb with the sweets of passion. Love, alone command me! My soul is a-throb with the sweets of passion. Oh, how sweetly his flattery falls upon my heart. - Love, alone command me! - Love trembles in a kiss! No, I beg you! You're mine! Your friends are waiting for you. Are you already sending me away? I'd like to say but I dare not. Tell me. Suppose I came with you? What? Mimì! It would be lovely to stay here. It's cold outside. I shall be near you! - And when we return? - Wait and see! Give me your arm, my dearest. I obey, my lord! Say you love me. I love you! My love! My love! I'm sure I remember meeting you before. I asked about you and discovered you lived here. I've been in love with you ever since. Traitor! Aren't you forgetting twenty others? This fine gentleman is a rake. Yes, I'm a monster. Ah, father! - Don't get so upset. - Behave yourself. Be nice. Don't make such a fuss. Prudence always gives way to pleasure and love. Your lovely hand. Are you joking? - No. - I'm ugly. - Come into my arms. - You're drunk. - With passion. Do you like playing games? - No, I want to marry you. - Give me your word. You're lovable. - Haven't you seen enough? - Evil traitor. Daughter of love, I'm enslaved by your charms. One word from you could ease all my pain. Feel how my heart is pounding. One word from you could ease all my pain. This nonsense just makes me laugh. These are the same words of love... I know just how much you mean it. - ...he said to me as well. - Your tears will not help. My fine sir, I'm quite accustomed to foolish jokes like this. O wretched heart betrayed, do not break for sorrow. I know how to deal with him. I myself don't know why people at once speak of love when they're near me, looking in my eyes and kissing my hands. I myself don't know why they talk about magic. None of them can resist me when they see me, when they pass me. But when the red light burns at the midnight hour and everyone listens to my song then the reason becomes clear to me. My lips, their kisses are so hot, my limbs, they're supple and white. It is written in the stars: "You must kiss, you must love." My feet, they float along, my eyes, they entice and smoulder. And I dance as though intoxicated for I know: my lips, their kisses are so hot. In my veins there courses the blood of a dancer for my mother was queen of the dance at the golden Alcázar. She was so miraculously beautiful. I've seen her often in dreams. When she beat the tambourine in a wild dance, every eye lit up. She wakes again in me. I have the same destiny. I dance like her at midnight and feel only one thing: My lips, their kisses are so hot, my limbs, they're supple and white. It is written in the stars: "You must kiss, you must love." And I dance as though intoxicated for I know: my lips, their kisses are so hot. The moon is high on the sea. Mamma mia, we'll be leaping. It's the perfect time for dancing. Plenty of lovers will be there. Quick, come here, girls. Dance in a circle. Each one of you will have a cheerful, handsome lad. While there's still a star in the sky and the moon is shining the loveliest boy and girl will dance all night long. Leap, leap, turn, turn. Every pair turn around. Step forward, step back, then to a new assault. Close in with the blonde girl, in and out with the dark. Follow on with the redhead, on the spot with the mousy one. Hurrah for the circle dance. I'm a king, I'm a sultan. There's nothing like it in the world. It's the greatest pleasure there is. At the thought of my love's possessor I feel a light-headed enchantment. Blessed be that little rogue who gets me dizzy! I love my darling because he steals hearts with his grace and sparkling wit. He makes me boastful because so many girls want him but cannot have him. I was born impulsive and I want him only for myself. Taking his love from me would be like taking the petals from a flower. I die of joy when he looks at me and I turn to jelly when he sighs. If he throws me a flower I can feel my little heart dying of love. Because he gives me wee glances, looking through half-closed eyes, very charming and very naughty, which say to me: "Ah, evening star," "for this little creature I am melting and dying!" I was born impulsive and I want him only for myself. Taking his love from me would be like taking the petals from a flower. I can return your toast, señores, for soldiers and toreros understand one another. Their pleasure lies in combat. The bullring is full; it's a holiday. The house is full from top to bottom. The spectators, losing their calm, are shouting back and forth, challenges, cries and uproar reaching the point of fury. For this is the celebration of courage, the celebration of the stout of heart. Come on! On guard! Come on! Come on! Toreador, on guard! Toreador! Toreador! And remember as you fight that dark eyes are watching you and that love awaits you, toreador, that love awaits you! Suddenly a silence falls. What has happened? No more shouts. This is the moment. The bull bursts forth, charging from his pen. He storms in and strikes. A horse falls, dragging down a picador. "Bravo, the bull!" yells the crowd. The bull retreats, returns and strikes again. Shaking his banderillas in fury, he rushes on. The ring is full of blood. All flee, clambering over the gates. Now it is his turn. Come on! On guard! Come on! Come on! Toreador, on guard! Toreador! Toreador! And remember as you fight that dark eyes are watching you and that love awaits you, toreador, that love awaits you! Let's drink from the joyous chalice where beauty flowers. Let the fleeting hour to pleasure's intoxication yield. Let's drink to love's sweet tremors, to those eyes that pierce the heart. Let's drink to love, to wine that warms our kisses. With you I would share my days of happiness. Everything is folly in this world that doesn't give us pleasure. Let's enjoy life, for the pleasures of love are swift and fleeting as a flower that lives and dies and can be enjoyed no more. Let's take our pleasure while its ardent, brilliant summons lures us on. Life is just pleasure. If one still waits for love. I know nothing of that. Don't tell me. But there lies my fate. Let's take our pleasure of wine and singing and mirth till the new day dawns on us in paradise.
