It was all her fault! It was not. Ah, ah, ah! Do you angels want to hear the story or not? Oh, yes, Anabelle. Okay, okay. Okay. This is a holiday story about three ghosts, two bad dogs, and an evil witch! Ghosts? Huh! So it is a dumb old fairy-tale. No, no, no. It's all true. In fact, the witch was my evil cousin. Belladonna! You mean the boogie-dog? Yes. This is how my two best guardian angels tried to stop her from ruining Christmas. Meet Charles Barkin, and Itchy Itchiford. Are they the ghosts? Well... I'll start at the beginning and let you figure it out. It was Christmas Eve, and San Francisco was preparing for a beautiful silent night. Wow!

Oh, come on, Carface, it's Christmas Eve, a time of giving. Hmm? Then give me the eight bones you owe me! It's not due yet, you tightwad. So I'm not paying now. You'll pay now, Charlie. In fact, you all will! Allow me, boss. Give. Give. Give. Give. Give. Give. Give. Well, aren't you too generous? Wow! Okay, start loadin' up the stuff, Killer. We're movin' out. I said let's go!

Look, he stole Timmy's operation money. I just... Ooh! Let me at him! What kind of creep would do that? Charlie? Why'd that guy take all our stuff? Hey, never fear, little ones, Santa's favorite reindeer and his number one elf will get your presents back. Every single one. Thank you, Charlie. Yay! Yay! Yay! Thanks, Charlie. We'll get those goodies back from Carface before the mistletoe gets cold. Hey, little man, it's getting late. I think it's time to get you home. Aw! I wanted to stay at the party. But it's Christmas Eve. And you know Martha must be missing you. Yeah. You know... She's not so bad for a human. Am I going too fast, Timmy? No, no. I'm okay. Look! There's Martha! Timmy! Come here, puppy. Come here, boy! Thanks, Sasha. Merry Christmas. Oh... Let's get you out of the cold. And I'll bandage your leg again, okay? Hey! Watch it! Whoa! Watch what? I can't see a thing. Hey... Oh! Whoa! Oh! Whoa! Easy, pal. Too much partying, huh? Ninety-four, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100! Oh, boy, boss, you sure know how to... Oh, hi there. I'm here to read the meter. What? 9:00 on Christmas eve? Yeah, holiday service. Just point us... I mean me to the meter, sir. Right up here, guys. Oh, sir... Hey, Charlie! Left. Right! I mean, go ahead. Careful! Whoa! Be careful. Be careful. Okay. We're at the top of the stairs, so turn right. Nice try! And a merry humbug! Well, maybe we should've tried a wig. Are you sure this is a good idea, Charlie? I mean, a chimney? Hey, it works for Santa, right? Ow! Hey, quit shovin'! Charlie, I'm stuck on something! You're kiddin', right? No, I really am. And in the twinkling, I heard on the roof... The prancing and yowling! Of each little goof. Stop hissing at me. I'm not hissing. What? It could've been worse! Steal Timmy's money, huh? Drop me in the trash, huh? And shoot me up a chimney, huh? Okay, that's it! Now we're gonna deck his hall! Ready! Yahoo! Four, three, two, one. Now! Told you we'd get in. Okay, Carface, give back Timmy's... Dough! Yeah. You can't just waltz into our party and steal our stuff! Sure I can. I've got this. Remember? Hand it over, smart guy! Ah, ah, ah! I'd love to, Charlie, but my boss just won't let me. Boss? You don't have a boss. Forgot me already, Chuckie? Belladonna! That's my name. Don't wear it out. So, Chuckie, seems you stumbled onto my little plan, huh? Don't talk to her, Charlie. She's evil and nasty, and bad! At least I'm more fun than my goody two shoes cousin! Oh, look at me, Miss perfect Anabelle. Head angel, queen of the clouds. Watch me make it snow for the kiddies! Give me that! So what's this hotsy-totsy plan of yours, hmm? Killer, do the honors. At midnight, when every dog in town is tucked into bed, we're gonna blow a magic dog whistle. Well... And all those darling Fidos and Fidettes will get that zombie look. Give! Give! Give! Give! And then they'll drag their master's gift right out of the doggy doors and bring 'em here to me. If chuckles here gets all the goodies, what do you get? Me? Hmm... I get to ruin Christmas! Except for one small point. This little toot couldn't wake a whole city. No. But this could! Ooh! It's gigantically humongous. You just gotta stop her, Carface. I'm beggin' you! You know, Santa's watching you, Carface. He knows if you've been sleepin'. He knows if you're awake. Forget it, Itch. You can't reason with flunkies. You gotta go to the source. Okay, Spiky, where's that big whistle, hmm? Ouch! Somewhere where you'll never find it, hot shot! Well, we're not leavin' till you tell us where it is! Hey, even Killer and me don't know. Do we? Yeah. We don't know anything. Oh, you'll be leaving all right. Meet my fire imps! Whoa! Charlie!Come on Itch, let's go! Wait for me! Come on, get the lead out! Down here! Ow! Ow! Ow! Come on! Ow! Giddy up! Left! This way! Down here! Charlie, where do you suppose Belladonna hid that giant whistle? Ooh. Well, that's gonna be tender. That's gonna be tender till the rose parade. Or maybe even till June. Mmm. Big yucks, Itch. Really big yucks. Charlie, what do we do now? Ah, you got me, Itch. You mustn't give up, Charles. Whatever you say, Anabelle. Anabelle? Oh, goodie! We could use your help! I have an urgent angelic mission for you both. You must stop Belladonna's evil plot! This affects thousands of families. So failure is not an option! Anabelle, for once you don't have to ask me twice. Yeah, Charlie! Nobody rips off kids while we're on duty. Now, I've left you something to help with your assignment. It will provide you with enough magic to devise a major plan! A miracle dog tag! Great! We'll find that big whistle in no time. Sorry, Charles, there's only so much I'm allowed to do. This tag won't locate the whistle. It will, however, help you find a way to foil Belladonna's plans. So think, boys, think. It's up to you to save Christmas. Ah, I don't know. Do you think we could turn Carface into a good guy? Good guy? Ha! Don't make me laugh! That mutt is a total scrooge! Itchy, baby! That's brilliant! Mmm, it is? Yeah. We're gonna run a scam on old Carface. A Dickens of a scam. Dickens? You know, that English guy who wrote... A Christmas Carol! Right! Now, remember how those three ghosts came to visit Scrooge? Uh, no. I don't like ghosts. Nothin' doin', Charlie. Oh, don't worry, Itchy, you won't see any ghosts. You sure? 'Cause you're gonna be one. Come on, Itchykins, my boy. Are you serious? You talkin' ghosts? Not for me, Charlie. No way. Mmm-mmm! Oh, tag... A little Christmas Carolmagic, if you please. Ah! What do you want? What are you doing in bed anyway? Our big heist is at midnight. Nah, I need my beauty rest so's I can look good! Now scram! Ow! Watch it! Television. Bah, humbug! I hate these Christmas specials! Welcome to CCN, the Carface Carruthers Network. Huh? That's me! Good evening. I'm Jacob Charlie. Welcome to our holiday special, "It's a Wonderful Carface." Uh-uh. I don't think so. In this story, you will be visited by three ghosts! Each will arrive at the chiming of a bell. I'll ring your bell, buddy! Ah, there's the first one. Time for ghost number one. So let's go back to a simpler time. That's where I was born! Hey, what gives? Huh? Itchy, what's going on? I am not Itchy! I am the Ghost of Christmas Past! With short legs! Oh... Do I look like I was born yesterday? Huh? As a matter of fact, yes! Mom? That's my mom! Yeah, and that's you, only smaller. Mom, it's me, Carface. Oh, she can't hear you. This is the past. You know, like a flashback. Boy, this really brings back memories. I miss my brothers and sisters. I bet they don't miss you. Wasn't I precious? Pushy is more like it. Yeah. But Mom still loved me. That was our last Christmas together. I never spent another holiday with Mom. Oh, Mom... I miss you. Come! We have other places to see! But I want to watch how cute I am. Hey, what took ya? Hey, it's the Parker house. This was my first human family. Oh, and there's Bobby. And there I am! There I am. I got away with murder at this place!
