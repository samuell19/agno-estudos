MY FATHER WAS RIGHT DIRECTED AND ACTED BY THE AUTHOR CHARACTERS AND THEIR PERFORMERS: HIS FATHER HIS SON HIS SON HIS DAUGHTER-IN-LAW HIS WIFE HIS SERVANTS AND HIS DOCTOR Come in. Come in! Who's there? It's you? Come in! Why don't you come in when I say "Come in"? It's not the first time! You wait till I turn around. - Why? - I don't know. You don't know? Make up your mind! What do you want? Nothing, Papa. Then Why'd you come in? - To say hello. - Hello? - We already said that today. - Yes. So you surely want something? Tell me! I'm busy working. What do you want? Nothing, Papa. My dear, you must stop talking that way. Yes, no, nothing! Aren't you old enough to think? Yes, Papa. So why don't you come in when I say so? Because you just say "Come in". - "Come in"? - Yes. - Instead of? - "Come in, son!" - "Son"? - Yes. But think, my boy! With my back turned, I can't see it's you knocking! Obviously! What a strange boy you are! - You don't want anything? - No, Papa. - Are you alright? - Yes, Papa. - You're not sick? - No, Papa. - Your mama hasn't come in? - No, not yet. - Were you playing outside? - Yes, Papa. - So go on and play! - But I've finished! - Finished? - I'm all played out. - So what will you do now? - Nothing! - You can't do nothing! - Why not? I don't know. But it seems to me... Well, I can't force you to play! - Want to stay here? - Yes. Then stay! - Don't just stand there. Sit! - I'm not tired. - Are you sad? - No, Papa. That's good. - Want to see some pictures? - No, Papa. Fine. I can't have you like this when I'm working! Tell Marie to give you some chocolate. Yes, Papa. - Here's Grandpa! - Lord! An interruption every five minutes! - Hello, Grandpa! - Hello, my boy! I haven't forgotten your bike. But I remember only when I see you! - But I won't forget it! - Me neither! Hello! - How are you, Papa? - Fine! In your way? You in my way, Papa? Never! Still calling me "Papa"! - Isn't that silly at your age? - Maybe. - Call me "Father" or "Adolphe"! - Why not? - Your wife's in? - She's not home yet. - What? - Not home yet! May I wait for her? - You want to talk to her? - No. Then why wait? She must have something to tell me. - Her? - Yes. She came to see me but I was out. - Why? - I don't know. She absolutely had to see me. That's what my butler said when I came in. - Oh? - Know why? No! He said she was nervous and upset. - So here I am! - Yes. - It's nothing serious? - I hope not. - Are you nervous? - Not at all! Good! Nervous people never do things right! - Staying for dinner? - I'm dining at my club. - All alone? - Yes. Then stay here! - No, I prefer my club. - Alright. And you dress to dine alone? - Yes, every night. - Extraordinary! Why? It's a good reason for dressing up. Indeed! Marie, Papa said to give me some chocolate. Chocolate? - A cigarette? - I guess so. - Those are American! - Yes. Why? No, thanks. They're too mild for me. They're like watered wine. I like dark tobacco, pure wine, lamb with garlic and women who are young! What good health! Superb! - Quite a sight! - I'm a sight? - I mean your health! - Yes... - Beautiful! - Enjoy it! When I don't see you for a few days it's a very pleasant surprise. - You look better and better. - True! - I feel better and better! - Really? Since my last case of flu, I'm a new man! We should be very ill every ten years. Afterwards, you're much better. - Maybe. - I'm sure of it! You get rid of a lot of rubbish! I've never felt so well. And two days ago, I was 77! - What? - Yes! What're you talking about? You're 72! - You know my age? - Of course! You were 61 on my wedding day 11 years ago. How can you be 77 today? - I've made myself older! - Older? Yes! It's fun! That way I can say I knew Louis-Philippe. - And you say it? - As often as I can! I made up a great story about why and how King Louis kissed me when I was 8. - Very flattering! - I'm sure! Have me tell you some time. The details are very moving. They always increase. The more I tell my tale, the more details there are! Why do you do it? Nothing's better than using the imagination! - Plus the joy! - Joy? What JOY? - The joy of lying! - Joy? Even better! It's pure delight! One of life's greatest delights! It's not tiring and is limited only by people's believing. You see where it can lead! It's a habit you develop. I began young. I lied to my parents, teachers, mistresses, friends and then I got married. - Don't tell me! - I will! When your mama died I was 50. I could no longer lie to her, so I made myself younger, to amuse myself. I did that until I was 70. Then, I suddenly made myself older to appear younger. It doesn't help much now but in five or six years, when I'm 78, think of when I say I'm 85! I'll be surrounded by attentive admirers especially because by that time my having known Louis-Philippe will seem quite important, - sort of intimate. - Yes, but I don't like lying. I hate it rather superstitiously. - Really! - Yes. - Afraid of being punished? - Maybe. And you? You made Mama think you were going deaf. Yes, she talked too much. That way I found a little peace. Later you became hard of hearing. Wasn't that your punishment? That's no punishment! Hard to be hard of hearing? I'd say so! What a mistake! Punishment? It's hard on the others but not on me! It's lovely! They only tell me basic things. Since they have to shout in my ear they think first! It's good for everyone. It doesn't keep me from talking and they can't interrupt me because I can't hear them! And the other deaf? I said, "And the other deaf?" They annoy you? They ask me to repeat everything and I love to talk! - Hello, son! - Papa! - Are you OK? - I'm fine! In a good mood? Always be in a good mood! _ Are you? _ Yes! - Nothing bothers you now. - I'm too old! - Nothing more can happen to you? - Yes! - What? - Dying! But that's unimportant. As for the rest... - You think about it? - Dying? Every day! Not at night. That'd be sad. In the morning and it's not sad at all! You still think life is... There's nothing better! Life's magnificent! But don't make it complicated! Remember what I said about your getting married? Indeed! - Still glad to be married? - Naturally! Good! If you're happy, that's superb! It's so lovely, wanting to make that trip together! But I feel sorry for those who make a mistake about it! - Weren't you happy? - No. - Why? - Due to your mother! - Mama? Why? - She cried so! Why did she cry? - She wasn't happy. - Why? Because of my behavior! Being sensitive, I was sad to see her cry so much. Someone other than your son might ask why you acted that way. I'd say it was because she was the same age as me! - You knew that when you married her! - But we were so young then! Your poor mama! She was a good woman. Yes! And very honest! But so boring! That's all over now. She wasn't very intelligent. And so boring! If you're like me, your wife will suffer. - And like Mama? - You'll be good! Thanks! I see what you mean! - How's it going? - What? You two! - Already? Why? - I don't know. Maybe she's not in very good health. - What's wrong? - I don't know. Did you notice anything? - Sort of. - What? The last time I had lunch here you didn't say a word. Sorry... Well? She was sad, absent-minded and distant that day. Did she say anything? - No. - Nothing? - You're worried. - No. You seem worried. Have you been careless? No, I don't have to be careful. - But you are! - No, I don't need to be. But you have a girl from time to time! - That's how it is. - I don't understand! Or else... it's your wife you're worried about? Another couple on the rocks! Shall I talk to her? I hate getting involved! I'll talk to her myself tonight. This morning I let her know I'm fed up. Something specific? No, but she goes out too regularly and it upsets me. I asked her to be home by 6.00. It's 6.15! She's not here and I hate tardiness! - Calm down! - Yes, I know. Don't get nervous. Hold your temper! And don't make any concessions! We must try to keep women under control. But if we can't, let them go! It's always an unequal battle with them. - You got married too young! - We were the same age! At 20, it's magnificent to be the same age. But later, you'll see the difference between a man and a woman at 50. First of all, women are ageless! They're young or they're old! Young, they cheat on us. Old, they hate to be cheated on! A man's a fool to wed at 19! - But, Papa, you know... - Yes, yes... - You always say that. - You both got foolishly involved. What a lesson! But it won't do anyone any good. Now you must try not to be too unhappy, because if you're unhappy you can't make anyone happy. In the name of the Good Lord, you can't go anywhere or listen to a soul without finding a bit of sorrow, sadness or trouble. Know what my 72 years have taught me? That the Turks weren't so dumb after all! - Know what I think? - No. Women are made for marriage men are made to be bachelors. - That's the trouble! - You like bachelorhood? It suits men! Widowers don't remarry as often as widows do! That's all because you're self-centered. - What? - You're self-centered! If that's all you find out. You admit you're self-centered? - Naturally! Like you! - I'm not. - No? - No! You will be... thank God! Thank God? Papa, at times don't you feel alone in life? - Of course, I'm alone! - You see? - I'm alone! Like you! - I'm not alone! Really? Aren't you alone when you and your wife dine alone without saying a word? When you disagree with her regarding no matter what aren't you alone at that very moment? - Every man is alone! - Don't say that! Why? It's not sad! What's sad is being surrounded by annoying people. Being alone is fine, believe me! Aren't you afraid the time will get longer? I don't fear it, I hope for it! I want it to last and never end! - My God, then are you happy? - Yes. - Really? - Yes! Of all things! Forgive me but you live such an exclusively material life. - Maybe. - You believe in nothing. - Nothing at all. - Honest, duty and all... When others believe in it, I'll see. But I don't set examples. - If others said that... - They do! - You don't believe in progress? - Nothing! Justice? Forget that! Love? - Women? - Love, yes. Unfortunately for us, love means women. So... women? Pretty! Very pretty, of course! But...? - Such little vixens! - Not all of them! - No, I mean only the pretty ones! - You're terrible! You don't believe in the family either? People in the same family can like each other, but that's all. Family evenings! Family life! - But if you're ill? - Don't be ill too long! If it's fatal, don't drag it out. Be discreet about it. Don't say that! If that's so, Papa, what's left? Nothing? - Yes! Friends! - At last! Friends! As long as you don't need them! You're depressing! No, but it's silly to live with illusions. Reality is better than any illusion! - You're sure? - Yes! - If you could relive your life... - Well? - Would you? - Yes! - Relive it? - 20 times! - The same life? - No! - You'd do what? - Nothing! So as to hurt no one! Fate didn't give me a creator's mind nor an apostle's soul. I'd do nothing. I'd admire the deeds of others and live only for myself and my pleasures. That's abominable! Then you can do just the opposite! You don't want to do good around you? Yes, maybe... I don't know. I'd do what I could, as I pleased and if it's good, all the better! - I wouldn't force myself. - I see. At my age you'll see you're not made for most of the things you felt obliged to do all through your life. Like it or not, in 20 years you'll say, waving your hands like this, "No, don't bother me! Let me pass! "Leave me alone!" You're the age that you are and you're going to be unhappy. You can try to be smart. But if you only knew what it is to be your age! It should happen at least twice in order to understand it! What? What is it? Experience can't be transmitted. But if only you knew how little it takes to be happy. 7.00! I must go! - Bye! - Bye, Papa! To think I was once like you! And that you'll be like me! My father was right! I wish I could give you what he gave me: the unlimited confidence we must have in life! - You're here? - Papa, can I talk to you? What about? Am I going to go to boarding school? - Who said so? - Marie just told me. Is it true? Yes, son, it's true. - Why? Have I been bad? - It's not punishment! - What is it? - It's a necessary obligation. I was a boarder too at your age. - Did you like it? - No. Then why make me go? - But... - Revenge? Such talk! I'll be alone at night! Alone? There are 50 boys in each dormitory! Then I'll be alone with 50 others. - Afraid to be alone? - Yes. I hear it's a habit one can acquire. In a month, you'll forget all about it. But you still think about it! I realized it was a necessity. - When? - The day I decided... - To send me there! - That's enough! A boy mustn't grow up with only women around him. With a mother who's always absent and a governess! With hair that makes you look like a girl, not a boy! You're very behind at school! You can't read well! You can't count! You cry every time I talk to you! - Because you scare me! - Scare you? Why? - Do I beat you? - Never! - So? - Maybe that's why. Such talk! - It's my fault you can't read? - Yes! - What? - You should've taught me! Maybe, but I've no time to teach you to read. I have other more serious things to do. Reading's not serious? I mean teaching it isn't my trade. - It's a trade? - It certainly is! - You don't know how? - No! - Maybe you could. - I'm not patient enough. - Tell me... - What? - You learned French history? - I did once. You forgot it? - It's forgotten? - Yes. - Then why learn it? - Don't ask! Just learn it! - Papa! - What? Do all nations have a French history? Yes! _ IS it pretty'? ' No! . - They have kings? - They do. - What are they like? - Nice! - Who's the greatest king? - Charlemagne! - Wasn't he an emperor? - An emperor too! - Papa! - What? If I study hard, do I still have to go? Yes, dear. Don't cry! I'm upset enough already! Hello! Yes! It's you? I didn't recognize your voice. Why didn't you come home by 6.00 as I asked you to? Why are you calling? You had an accident? Then why phone? To talk to me? Then come home! No? What does that mean? What an odd voice! Where are you phoning from? It doesn't matter? Alone? Yes. Maurice is with me. Why? He can't hear what you say. Yes, alright. Leave me alone with Mama, dear. Go ahead, I'm listening. Very! You're too nervous! I meant to discuss it tonight. You knew what? That I meant to discuss it? So you didn't come home! Why? Why won't we talk about it? What do you mean? Over? What's over? Come home at once! Have you gone crazy? The courage to see what? Life? You're blaming life for what? Unbearable in what sense? What're you getting at? Just say the words as they come! You're a victim of what? What feeling? Not enough willpower? Leave? Where to? When? Tonight? You're leaving tonight? Who made the decision? You! When? A month ago! You've kept this secret for a month! Like a poison! You lived and slept next to me with this idea! Afraid of whispering it in your sleep! For a month you've lied and let me talk about the future! Remember what you told me two days ago? I was already holding another man's woman in my arms! If you knew the disgust I feel right now! How could you wait till the last moment to tell me this? Why? You were scared? Not proud of yourself! Coward! And Maurice! Yes, go away! What a vile woman! Where are you calling from? The train station! To think you didn't come home out of fear! Afraid I'd retain you by force! You don't know me! Retain you? No! I'm prouder than that! Go on! Cry! Explain? Don't explain a thing! Go! Hang up! You first! You're the one who's leaving! I want to hear the phone click as you go! Go! Go! No! Lies! Saying it's over like this! It's over! Go! Hello? Maurice! - Here I am, Papa! - Maurice! Yes, Papa? You called? - Why? - I don't know. Just to say hello. And to say I lied to you earlier. I think I recall a lot of French history. You've given me an idea. I don't think you'll go to boarding school. Instead, I think I'll become a teacher. But to start with, I'll have only one pupil. - Me! - Yes. You! I'll teach you all I know! At first we'll have fun but one day I think it'll fascinate us! If only I can make you a happy man! Come in. Come in! Who's there? Come in, son! Why didn't you come in at once? Why are you laughing? - Don't you remember? - What? 20 years ago, Papa, at that very door, I made you say "Come in, son!" Not "Come in!" I remember. You were terrible! You refused to see why your papa... I couldn't accept not being called son. Besides, that still moves me. My boy, that's all so long ago! You didn't tap on that pane then. It was the lower one! Yes, long ago! Yet I still see that day with extraordinary precision. I sat there, wearing my big blue collar. You were there, dressed all in gray. - Think so? - I'm sure of it! Remember what happened that day? - No. Was it important? - Yes, very! That night we dined together alone for the first time. - It was that night? - Yes. - Forgive me! - Please! Besides, we must talk about that today. About that and some other things. - Leaving? - No. Today's your birthday. - Pardon? - It's your birthday today! - True! - You didn't know it? Yes, but I forgot. - Nobody reminded you of it? - No. I thought you had someone who'd remind you. What you're referring to ended four months ago. - My boy, I beg your pardon. - Never mind! - So now you... - I have a new one. - Good! But she didn't think of... - It's too recent. For now, we only remember her special dates. - But that's unimportant. - Anytime you want to discuss it... - Maybe later. - I can wait! Meanwhile, shall I talk to you about me? Yes, Father. - What? Father? Why "Father"? - I don't know. An odd idea! I thought now that I'm 30, maybe you'd prefer... - Never! - Good! I prefer "Papa". And so do I. Here's what I want to say. After teaching history and geography, I taught you all I knew about life. It took me 20 years. I've lasted that long and now that you know as much or as little as I do - I can quit. - Quit? I've worked enough. You're ready to run things. - You like our business? - Very much! Then henceforth you'll take over. I taught you to row. Now you'll steer the ship. Sail slowly away from the shore so I can still guide you. Why stay ashore? To breathe, live and enjoy doing nothing. - Are you tired? - No, but you're worried. Don't be! I'm neither weary nor dejected. Besides, I don't really mean I'm quitting. I just want to stop for a while, for ten years. Then I'll get back into harness but for now, I'm interested in things new to me, such as painting, theatre and stylishness. - Stylishness? - Indeed! I held it in contempt but now it tempts me! I've worn this tired old jacket for 20 years? Adieu or farewell to all that! I've lived with my grandmother's furniture most of my life. I'm tired of Louis-Philippe. I want to rejuvenate all this! - How? - With Louis XVI! - Do you approve? - Please, Papa... We must agree! That's the only way it'll be charming. You must realize I've just reached 50, roughly half of my lifetime. Because of duty or reason I haven't used all that's in me, meaning my youth. I want to see if life has more in store for me. Our material matters are easily settled. I wrote it all down this morning. A nice birthday present! - I'm sure! Thank you! - Hush! As for the house, that's different. Your old birthplace, far from town, with its lovely garden! - What do you prefer? - For? Do you want it or may I have it? - But... - What? We're separating? Life together could become delicate! Who knows what your life or mine will be like? Thus far, we've always been very discreet. But anything may happen! One day you'll get married. - Never! - Why not? Just because! Perhaps I've said too much against marriage. I kept you with me till you were 30 to keep you from being as silly as I was at 20. You're 30! A man! It's your decision! I decided long ago! You told me not to make a bad start in life and told me what I needed to know. I may not recall all my algebra but the subject of women is firmly engraved! I see I went too far. We mustn't exaggerate their strength nor our weaknesses. We too are armed! - You didn't say... - I did! - No, Papa! - I'm sure I did! You didn't pay attention. Women are usually enemies, but dishonest ones and can be caught! Also, women are very pretty! - Of course! - We must think of that! Yes, Papa, I do! All the time! But a wife? A wife in the house? An organized existence for a lifetime? Yes, it's serious. And if you're wrong it's a horrid error that can bear fruit! A child from such an error? Never! Don't say that! I'm glad you're here! But it can be serious. Take it seriously and it can be grave! Each day, a new problem must be resolved. I read 20 books on heredity because of you! I swore to fight any bad influence I might have on you. I dug through my family and your mother's. - I had to stop. - Why? I was so discouraged. I found everything! Idiots, alcoholics, a senator, a process-server. To think you might be like them, it was just too unfair! The phone... Yes, madam. No, madam, here he is. - A lady for you. - For me? Good Lord! - A lady? I thought it was for you. - For you! No, madam. Who are you? Just a moment! Could you leave? - Of course! - Just two minutes! Of course! I'm listening. See me? Is that really necessary? Absolutely? That's what you say! Where are you calling from? The train station again! I don't feel like laughing but you make me laugh. A phone call from the station every 20 years! Why are you at the station? You're back! Yes, he's well, thank you. So am I... You're too kind. Again I ask you. Is a meeting truly necessary? Alright. Afraid? No, I'm not in any danger. Using the phone for such a thing! Yes, he's here. No, I can't answer you yet. No, we'll have to discuss it first. Alright. I'll be expecting you. Yes, the same address... See you later! I don't know where I put it! Maurice! - You called? - Yes. - Mama? - Yes. - On the phone? - I'm waiting for her. How do you feel? I feel cold and like I can't breathe. - It was her! - Yes, son. We discussed it once 15 years ago but never since then. We've only mentioned her in the past tense and short phrases. We affected a rather serious indifference and suddenly life has become quite specific. If we love life, we'll truly have to live it in a moment. Especially you! As for me... So think and tell me how you want this to happen. If you want the meeting postponed or canceled do exactly as you wish. - So how do you feel? - Quite differently from you! We're to see a lady who was my wife and is still your mother. - Even so! - 20 years! True! I look at this and I'm 10. That door will open and I'm 30. She's 50. - She must be gray. - I hope so, for her sake. One never knows! You're deeply moved? - Very! - That's all we need! - May I ask you something? - Anything! - What was she like? - In what way? As a woman. Her personality. She was... like that! She was adorable! Like her picture! It should've and could've been marvelous! But the calamity happened. You know she told me about it by phone? She's announced her return by phone! The phone's made progress! - Yes, it's been 20 years. - Almost. She was in America. Do you know where she lived? - I didn't dare ask! - Of course. - I'd like to ask... - Ask me anything! - Are you divorced? - No. Because of you. That may be what she wants now. To legalize her situation. Maybe she's had children. Anything's possible. I won't refuse a divorce now. It'd be best that way if she wants to live in Paris. - It's up to you. - I think so. Tell me. When she left, did she want to take me with her? I don't want a faux pas from Emile! Emile! Come here! Don't question the lady who's at the gate. Just show her in and say she's expected. Yes, sir. Go upstairs! - You'll do as I say? - Yes, Papa! - Come down only if I call. - You'll call? You want me to? - You decide! - Go! - Mr. Bellanger? - Come in! Madam is expected. I'm expected? Well! I really have a nerve! My heart's pounding! I feel like leaving! This is crazy! I'll leave... Too late! This must be him! It's him! Sir, forgive me for coming here... Forgive me, miss! Who are you? I'm Loulou! - What? - Loulou! I could lie and say I'm Loulou's friend, but it's better to tell the truth. I'm Loulou! I know this is incorrect but you'll forgive me once you know why I'm here. - May I please tell you? - Please! Am I interrupting? - No, but I may shortly be obliged... - I understand! I'll explain fast! It seems my dream of a lifetime is impossible because of you. Because of me? Yes and I was sure of that till just a minute ago. But now that I can see and talk to you and look at you, I can't believe it. With eyes like yours, you can't be mean! I bet you can't be led by the nose and you're right about that, believe me. But unfortunately I don't quite know what to think. I'm very nervous. I must be making a strange impression on you. What's your impression? You impress me as being a person who's honest and determined and who came to the wrong door. Whom do you think you're talking to? - His father! - His father? - Aren't you? - Whose father? - Maurice's! - Yes, I have a son named Maurice. So I'm right! How you scared me! - It's about Maurice... - Yes, Sir. I'm his girlfriend. - Didn't you know? - No. - Know what he told me? - No idea! He said you two had had a long talk about me. I don't recall it. What a liar! Well, I'll tell you the truth. - Go right ahead! - I can never lie. Here's the simple truth. I was a seamstress. I met Maurice. Two months ago... - You quit work! - It's simple! It's so natural! - Isn't it? - Yes. He rented me a lovely little apartment. Seen from afar, my life seems filled with happiness. Yet it's spoiled when Maurice comes to lunch each day but won't stay for dinner or overnight. - No! - Never! When I ask why, do you know what he says? Papa won't stay alone nights. - No! - Yes! At first I accepted it and said nothing. Finally I saw it wasn't the real truth. He doesn't want you to be alone! I understand him! That's why I came! Maurice is right! You mustn't be alone! Here's my idea! It may sound crazy but since I want everyone to be happy I think it's fine! I know what I'm talking about! But now I'm too embarrassed to tell you because you're not like what I expected. - I thought you'd be... - How? Very short with a pointed beard! Never mind. Tell me your idea. I'm curious. Here it is, sir! Let's see... Who's this nymph? She's my girlfriend who needs someone. She's a seamstress too. She wants a change but I don't. I like what I've found. She wants someone serious. To each his own! I thought you'd be just what she dreams of. She'd be satisfied and you'd have a girlfriend. - What do you think? - I think you're charming. And she's adorable! Is this balustrade at her home? - At the photographer's! - The photographer... - And cute? - Yes, very! - And good! - She looks it! No, I mean, she's still very good. I didn't know your preferences but that's how she is! It's not a real problem. Only momentary! - Soon ended! - Her name is Henrietta. I said to change it but she's stubborn! - Isn't she wrong? - About...? Keeping Henrietta. It's so plain and old-fashioned. It's not up-to-date! I begged her to change it but she won't. But if you ask her, I'm sure she will! - It's not important, is it? - I don't find it terribly important. Don't you think that for me and this child the age difference is a bit large? Yes, but I'm sure you'd never want one of your own age. If you want one not so old pick one who's really young! How right you are! If you're concerned about fidelity pick a new, fresh one who won't know any better! That's very sound reasoning! But for now... - Her address is on it. - I saw it. Now let's talk about you. - Me? - Yes. - You've been his girl for... - For two months. And you love him. That much! - Sorry! - For what? Talking this way. Sorry if I speak badly and about Henrietta too if I was wrong. I pay no attention to how I talk. I let myself go because I know my feelings are right. - I'm sure of that! - Me too. That's why I'm so tormented. Yes, what's happened is sad. - Maurice doesn't think I love him. - That's silly! Yes, he is! And he never says he loves me! Yet I swear on my mama that he does! - Believe me! - I do! He loves me as much as I love him... Almost! But he won't discuss it. - Out of modesty? - I don't think so. He seems afraid of all that as if he can't forget something bad that once happened to him. - I don't believe so. - No. He told me about other affairs and bragged that they were very short and of no importance. Why do you think it was something bad? From things he's said. When I mention our future, because for me, the future is us, he says, "One day you'll phone and say you're deserting me!" What? - He said those very words? - Yes! Often! - It's a bad sign? - No. Continue! To say such a thing to me! I'd die if I didn't see him at least once a day! And he's mean to say that when we don't even have a phone! I don't see why he distrusts me. You're not the one he distrusts, my child. - Then what? - No doubt life scares him. - Talk to him! - I've talked to him but... Do we always say the things we should? Yet at times he can be so tender. He doesn't really act his age. He's one or the other! A 60-year-old who's seen it all and believes in nothing! Or he's like a 5-year-old! Sometimes he'll spend hours with his head resting on my shoulder, not like a man with his mistress but like a boy with his mother. - Indeed. - If only he'd trust me! - Sir! - Yes, darling? You know life! - Find a way to make him trust me! - I'm trying! I think we're too often apart. If we spent a week together alone it'd be different afterwards. What's stopping you? - You again, sir! - It's always me! For a week he's talked about taking me to Venice for Easter week. Venice is beautiful! It's not bad! It won't happen cos it's already too late. We were to leave tonight. He'll find an excuse not to go! He won't leave you and also a friend said to him, "Once you've seen Venice, you'll be inseparable!" He turned pale and changed the subject. You'll go to Venice tonight. You'll both go to Venice tonight! Want to bet 5,000 francs? - I can't! - You don't have 5,000? Buy the tickets! And a gift for his birthday today! Go home, pack and wait for him! - But.. - You'll do as I say? - Gladly! - Go! - I beg of you! - What? - Don't say I came! - I won't. - Promise not to tell? - I swear! - Are you angry I came? - Do I look angry? - Not at all! - So? You're nice, sir. It's nice being nice but it's not everything! Now I'll have to please Henrietta. Do you think I will? - Yes, but don't frighten her. - What could scare her? - Your eyes! - What about them? - Well... - I've no others! They'll do. Don't make fun of her! I'm sure you'll like each other. - And if I cheat on her? - She'll love you! - Which way out? - That way! - If I meet someone? - Say hello! - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Will you come here a moment? Can you leave Paris for a week? - Yes. Why? - Then go! - And you? - I'll be gone too! Keep me posted! Send me messages all the time! Hello. Please sit down. I've gone mad! Tell yourself that! You must admit it's true! Try to understand me! You must be not kind but intelligent and admit it! Can't a woman truly go mad? I swear that's what happened! I was insane! Pardon me. What are you talking about? My departure! - Not really! - Yes! - About your leaving? - Yes! After 20 years, our conversation is to pick up from where we left off? Your departure! Do you think I'm still the same man whom you deserted? Look at me! - It's you! - Because you know it is! Would you have recognized me in the street? - Yes. - I doubt it! - Wouldn't you? - Recognize you? No! You're extraordinary! - Have I changed a lot? - Like me! - A woman mustn't... - Why not? Because your hairstyle is the same? It's not a question of hair! No, I'm not the same man you deserted and you're not the same woman who left! We're now two new people who don't know each other. So forget a conversation that ended 20 years ago! - I strictly forbid it! - Why? Why? 20 years ago any excuse for your behavior was impossible. - You left like a madwoman. - Exactly! I didn't know what I was doing. - But now I understand. - I understood you then, but not now! It took you 20 years to remember and me, 20 years to forget. I won't go back to the day you left, luckily for you because if I had the strength I'd no doubt commit assault and battery! - No, I'd find the right words. - Yes, I know! You're all alike and capable of anything! After 30 years we know nothing about you and we're babies before a new face, but only when facing a new one because an old one can't fool us twice! That's our strength! When we know women it usually means only 1, 2 or 3, not the others! And those two or three needn't come back! Once is enough! As for the rest, let them come anytime! Eyes closed! But not you! So please leave the past alone and understand that I no longer see the woman who left here 20 years ago. You could be her mother! - How you hate me! - No! Hate you? Don't digress! Hate? At my age? It's too late! Hate? How demanding! Go ahead, I'm listening. - You know what my life has been. - No. - What? - No! - Nor where and how I've lived? - No! - That I was in America? - Yes! But not whether it was North or South America! - I was in Rio de Janeiro. - Fine. You're not unaware that the friend I lived with died three months ago. Yes! - You're unaware? - Yes! You knew... Nothing! I never tried to find out a thing. - I'll tell... - Don't tell me a thing! Just say why you're here today. That's all! - Your affairs don't interest me. - My affairs? I didn't have some affairs. I had one beautiful affair that gives me the right to call it a perfectly noble, exemplary life. - What? - It's true! I erred 20 years ago but I've atoned for it! - With whom? - Don't make jokes! I've atoned for it through my behavior, devotion and good manners. Don't say it's a far-fetched lie! For 20 years I proved to the entire city my absolute fidelity! - You're totally mindless! - Not at all! Yes, you are! Telling me about your fidelity! I'm the one man to whom you should never say that word! - You know what you just said? - I said...? For 20 years you exemplified virtue! - And it flatters you to repeat it! - I'm proud of it! It's incredible! In front of me you brag of being faithful to another man! What do I care about that? It's to show you I didn't act like a madwoman! You want my approval? Just don't change the subject on purpose! If you didn't take it personally you'd understand. Magnificent! - Just listen to me! - That's all I do! Listen to the meaning of my words! Begin by giving them a meaning! - Accept one thing. - What? - Trust me! - Impossible! Pretend we don't know each other. - What for? - Just try! So we don't know each other! And I come to you and say, 20 years ago I erred and acted like a woman who'd lost her head. I was unforgivable at that very moment! Since then, my behavior has been such that the continuity of my sin has become its own apology - and my pardon! - I understand. So I didn't truly lose my head! I was faithful in my betrayal! Tell that to people who don't know you. Tell it to anyone except me! It will sound odd to them but it's dizzying to me! There's a bit of dizziness in your case. You'll end up saying you should be forgiven for deserting me out of love! No! Please! - Don't say that in Paris! - Parisians are prudes? We know what's ridiculous! - They don't pardon sin? - Never! - Some do! - They're wrong! But you're not here to ask for my forgiveness? - Yes! - What for? - To get it! - And then? Take my place again! - Where? - In my home! You're crazier than 20 years ago! - I've a right... - No right! - To ask! - And you'll get a refusal! - You're sole judge? - Who else? - Our child! - My God! - Our child is a man! - You told him... No need to! One day he understood! - I'm ready to face him. - I'm sure! - He won't judge Mama. - Such words! Words with meaning! Yes! I didn't say no! - Call him! - No! Not so fast! Wait! Wait? You'd ask a mother to wait? You've waited 20 years! So, five more minutes... May I smoke? Good. First, kindly give up any ideas of a pardon, redemption or reclaiming your place in this home. What if Maurice's happiness depends on our reconciliation? - And my happiness? - Make a sacrifice! Another one? No! - I've done all a father should. - What did you do for him? What did I do? You're asking me? I was 30 when you left. To avoid marrying again I didn't get a divorce. I spent my time educating him. I raised a very intelligent boy. He can stand alone now. The years I have left I mean to live them for myself! You talk to me of coming back here and I'm asking you for a divorce. - Now? - Yes, he doesn't need you now. - You're sure? - Sure or not, it's what I want! - Like a royal decree? - It's my decree! - Your name? - You used it there? The way you bore my name here wasn't encouraging. It's so easy to wander for 20 years and then come home when you're lonely. Have you no pity? - For those worthy of it! - How simple! Did you pity me? - No, but you're better than I am. - Indeed! I thought you might make a gesture a bit... - Idiotic! - No! Anything not thought out is idiotic. The forgivers will say, "Act right!" and I'd act like them if I didn't control myself. Otherwise, you'd take pity? When you came in I almost took you in my arms. But what for? - We'd now be... - Now here! What a life! I can easily see ours! Gentle, smiling and peaceful! I'd give you all my affection. - I see you calmer in old age. - What eyesight! - When you're ill... - I expected that one! Illness! Wishful hopes! I'm not sick! - But when you are... - We'll discuss it then! For now, I'm fine and need nothing! - "Store is no sore"! - Good Lord! - What? - Adages! Your fourth today! I recall how you lived on adages. "One sorrow expels another"! "One swallows not a summer"! I can only tell you one thing: "The future belongs to God." But what's your place here? Where is it? - Here! - Where you are? There's also a dining room, bedroom... Maybe it's occupied. - You think... - Not a thing! - Thank heavens! - Congratulations! She's lovely! - Who? - The girl I met as I came in. - She's charming. - I'll tell her. - If you wish. Although... - What's wrong with her? She's perhaps a bit young. - Young? For you or for me? - For you! - For me she's perfect. - Be careful! Nothing surprises me! Look no further! Here's what our life would be like! You're almost jealous and you only just arrived! No, you don't belong here. We're not a father and mother nor husband and wife. We're lovers... Just ex-lovers. You left as a mistress and return now as a mother. You need gray hair. We might become a bizarre couple like so many others if we hadn't once been in love. Remember? People should never separate if they hope to grow old together. What'll become of me? Even so! Counsel me! Earlier, when you spoke of yourself and wanting to live for yourself, your eyes began to smile. Think of that again! Think of being happy so they'll smile again! Counsel me. When I spoke of my rights I didn't really believe in them. When I demanded my place in the household it was merely my way of asking you for it. I could have begged you on my knees! Pay less attention to my words and voice - and see only the deeds. Please? - Yes. After 20 years away, I suddenly ask to return home. It's mad! It's stupid! It's insane! Nevertheless it's certain that I'm asking it of you. Counsel me! Send for Maurice! - Don't say that! - Why? I don't want him to see the pathetic sight of a couple trying to patch things together. It's not a pretty sight! I'm already worried about Maurice in that respect. - How so? - Well... Your departure 20 years ago left an indelible mark on his mind. Can you understand? I've slowly won his trust now and mean to keep it. I'd lose it by behaving in such a weak way. If you only knew... how he talks about you unknowingly when he talks about women! You asked for my counsel? Here it is: come back in 10 years! - You're horrible! - Why? How cruel! Come back in 10 years! To say that to a woman! Your wife! The mother of your son! - How'll she live 10 years? - I don't care. You don't care how she'll live! Let her die of misery and sorrow! Let her run like a mangy dog! Laughed at by some, scorned by others! You're starting to bore me! That's enough! Stop judging me! You want me to repeat things 20 times so I appear to abuse my rights. I'm not fooled by what you're doing. I've no more to say to you! Really! I'm wrong to let you talk. It's unforgivable! Unfair! You have money? - Yes. - Well then? - Let me keep your name! - That may be best. Let me see Maurice. Five minutes! I said no! Don't insist! Not with your hair like that! It's indecent! You'd be ashamed of yourself! I'm that shabby? That's not the question! SQ? - What? - Tell me! - What? - That I'm not shabby. Say something nice! - Something nice? - Yes! Say something nice! My heart hurts! Say something so I won't cry! Say something nice! Look at me! Say exactly what you think of me! - Such trust! - In you! - In us both! - So say it! - What do you want me to say? - I don't know either but... I'd like to go after hearing something nice from you! Give me more confidence! You want me to say you can still easily fool me? That's what you want me to say. That's what you're thinking. Well? Yes! - Really? - Yes! Thank you! Not another word! Your hand! Thank you! My God! And to think we suffer for that! How silly we must be! Emile, I'm going out! Prepare my dinner. If I'm not home by 2.00 you eat it! Yes, sir! Which of you beauties is going to die on my heart? - Sir! - What? - Just a word, sir! - Which one? - You're going out? - Yes, I'm going out! You joked when telling Emile you might not come home tonight? - The idiot told you? - Yes! - It's true? - Yes. Why? - You were so late last night. - Spying on me? No, sir, I wouldn't dare but you were out and I was so worried I couldn't sleep! Worried? Why? - No idea! - So? - You're not afraid? - Afraid of what? Tiring yourself out! - I look tired? - No. - So? - You've changed a lot lately. I've changed? For better or for worse? I couldn't say but you're not the same. - What's changed? - I don't know. You're funny. - Do I make you laugh? - No. But you laugh all the time and make jokes. That's forbidden? No! For someone else, it'd perhaps be natural but for you, it's so extraordinary! You were so serious, so solemn. Seeing you suddenly like this makes quite an impression! How have I changed? Can't you see you're not the same? You dress differently. - Badly? - No! You frightened me! - A charming tie? - Yes. - A lovely hat? - Yes. So life is beautiful! Even so, aren't you sad at heart? - No. Why? - Because of all this! All what? - You're going to change more? - Do you mind? Seeing this beautiful house go to pieces! It's not! It's the inside that's changing! Yes! All your mama's old furniture! - So? - Replaced by new things! New? These are antiques! The others were just old! What's that over there? Your antique man brought it this morning. - He brings something every day. - You didn't tell me! He's charming! He said to keep it two or three days and if you don't like it, return it. Return it? How have I ever lived without him? Isn't he charming? - Who is he? - I don't know. Not yet! Emile! We'll learn his identity! Emile, please take down... Let's see... That man in shirt sleeves. He's indecent! Replace him with this portrait of my great-grandfather. - He's... - This 10-year-old is my great-grandfather! Look at his eyes! All the family has his eyes, right? - Say yes! - Indeed, there is something, sir! It's obvious! And you, Marie? - Say yes! - He has a bit of you! Of course! So he's the husband of your grandmother's mother? Not really but he was my great-grandfather all the same. A lady's honour is at stake, you see? So not a word to anyone in the neighborhood! - Indeed! - Goodbye! Marie, what do you think? There's something but not like you said. I had an impression! He doesn't seem crazy. Crazy people don't always look like they are! It's not natural for a man his age to laugh all the time. He wakes up singing and leaves the house singing. Off-key but he's singing! I mean, really! You've been here for 30 years. You raised Maurice. - It's your duty to alert him at once. - But where? I saw his address on a letter mailed to him and copied it on my cuff! - When? - Six days ago! - Change more often! - I kept it on, on purpose! Is there time to write? He was to be gone a week and it's been two! - Send a telegram! - That'll cost a lot! Just use 4 words: Father has gone crazy. Emile, you can't say such things so bluntly! Then say: Father is rather crazy. We can't use the word crazy. Then say: Father is rather odd. No, he wouldn't understand. - Then say anything! - Suppose... - Don't bother! Here's Maurice! - Leave us alone! How wonderful! Good Lord! It's you! How wonderful! - Is Papa sick? - Not sick but... What? What is it? - May I be frank? - Of course! Well, then... Since you left, he's changed a lot. - In what way? - Well... Like that! - What does that mean? - Like he's sort of deranged! Deranged? Him? - What did the doctor say? - Nothing. - He hasn't seen him. - Why? - We didn't call him. - You should've called him at once! Sit down, darling. - He's in bed? - Who? - Papa! - No. - Where is he? - Out! - Alone? - Yes. Then it's not serious! I'm not saying it is! But I'm glad you're home! - When will he be home? - About 7.00 to put on his tuxedo. - He's dining out? - Like every night! - And wears a tux! - Him? Well, well, well! - Where does he usually dine? - At his club. - Papa? - Yes, every night! - Like his father used to! - Call the doctor! It's best we do! The doctor's known Papa for ages. He'll see at once what's wrong. - Is Emile here? - Yes. Take my car and go for Dr Mourier at once. Say it's for Papa. I'll phone him. Wait! Does Emile know what you said about Papa? - Yes. - Good. Marie says you think Papa's changed a bit. Quite a bit! Is there anything that's really struck you? Well... it's just that... Speak freely! - You'll understand. - Yes. - It's little nothings... - Nothings... - ...that give me a feeling... - Feeling... and that's what makes it curious. Go get the doctor at once. Loulou, be sweet and get me Wagram 87.73. Wagram 8773... Marie, can't you tell me something specific about Papa that I can tell the doctor? I don't know. Look around you! - The furniture's changed! - I see. He emptied the rooms in two hours! Doesn't that mean something? Like he's empty-headed! No, there's absolutely no connection! Wagram 8773... Wagram 8773... What are you doing? Wagram 8773... Memorizing the number! - Dial it instead! - Sorry! Know what happened between Papa and my mother the other day? I only know she came for half an hour and left. - You saw her leave? - Just a glimpse! - Was she crying? - No, she was laughing! She shouted, "Thank you!" How was Papa that night? - Fine! - Fine... - Darling, what are you doing? - Calling the doctor! I haven't stopped dialing! Maybe I'm doing it wrong. - You'll soon get it! - Hello? Dr Mourier? Hold on! Maurice Bellanger speaking! I'd like to see you at once about my father. I just arrived and Marie's told me things that worry me. The past few days, it seems he's been... rather... excitable... especially nervous. But I hope she's exaggerating. I'd like you to find an excuse to drop by at once, examine him and tell me what you think. Yes, I've sent my car for you. At once? Thank you! I'll be waiting. - Do you have some ice? - Ice? - Yes, ice! - No! - Get some at once! - Alright! What do you think? You're wrong to worry without seeing him! - You know servants... - You're right. I must be careful. They see things in such an odd way. - I shouldn't have gone. - Why? Left alone, he may have lost his head! He might have... - Who knows? - What? - One can imagine all sorts of things. - What do you imagine? Maybe he met someone! - What is it? - Nothing! But would that be a catastrophe? - I'd say so. - Why? If he were a naive, rickety little man, I'd tremble for him. But as smart as he must be, with his strength and health... What? You've never met him! No, but from what you've said, he must be big and strong. - It's not a question of size! - Yes, it is! Besides, a woman's not inevitably a catastrophe. - Not all of them. - You agree? That's progress! If only you really agreed! If you wouldn't talk about women as you did before! - Before what? - Before our marvelous trip! Admit that it's modified your opinion a bit. Maybe I've found an exception. Maybe! I'm sure! Are you afraid you're wrong? Terribly afraid! What if you learned I'm a mere nothing? - Hush! - Do you love me? I don't know. But I do like you! My God, I do like you! You smell good! My perfume? Do you think I mean your perfume? Your eyes change when you look at me. For good reasons. Maurice, what would make you completely happy? Being sure that I make you happy. Trusting you. Knowing you couldn't lie to me. I've decided to introduce you to my father and marry you in a few weeks. But if I ever learn you've lied to me for any reason whatsoever, it's best you not marry me. I know me! Your life would then be unbearable and mine too! I detest lying rather superstitiously. I'm certain I've never lied. - That's why I'm so severe. - Whom do you trust? - My father! - But he must know women! I think so. If you knew he approved of your choice... - ...would you trust me? - Yes! - Like to know if he thinks I'm nice? Of course! - Like to know at once? - Yes. - Suppose I said... - What? To find out once and for all, you could introduce me in a special way, as if you barely knew me. That way he'd let himself go. You'd know the truth and see if he likes me! That might be dangerous for me! But I'll run the risk! - Darling, even better... - Yes? - Leave us alone together! - No, no need for that. But I like your idea. I'd like to know his opinion. If you'll run the risk, so will I! But I don't even want to consider it until the doctor... Here he is! - And me? - Get in the car. Park 100 yards away and... Once your father's home, I'll park by the gate. How will you recognize him? I'll bet you 100,000 francs I can! - How? - You'll loan me the money! - I adore you! - Me? - Him! - Congratulations! Emile explained your fears to me. I think you're exaggerating. I agree, doctor, but I'd like to clear things up. We'll know at once! Thank you but we must find an excuse for your being here. - I have it! Marie! - Perfect! Tell me, how does mental upset become apparent? In several ways! Oddities, a certain volubility, an uncommon over-excitation in spite of normal feverishness! - Emile... - He's that way? He said that during your absence your father changed the furniture. That's an oddity. No, I knew weeks ago he meant to do that. It's amazing what he bought in two weeks! I don't recognize any of these things! Tell me, doctor. - Can a man suddenly go insane? - Insane?! My friend, I daily note a painful fact concerning words that constantly lose a bit of their meaning. What does insane mean? Words mustn't be used at random like that. Insane! You ask if your father... You're insane! Besides, for a doctor the word has no precise meaning. We classify the imbalanced by category in a special way. According to your butler and from what I've found by observing your father, I would classify him among those who are... - ...futile. - Futile? - Father is...? - Futile! It wouldn't surprise me! - It's serious? - Not at all! - Not at all? - No. It's a rather gentle downhill inclination. Leading...? To almost total thoughtlessness! Have you found this condition among other people? Yes. I find it frequently among most men who are over 50 and whose physical organs are unimpaired. - So he's in good health? - Yes! - No need to worry? - No! Here he is! - I'll pretend to leave! - Perfect! Maurice is back! - He looks well! - It's just as I thought! Where is he? What a lovely surprise! Let me kiss you! - How are you? - Fine, Papa! - A good trip? - Excellent! - Health? - Fine! - The room? - Unrecognizable! - But...? - Magnificent! - Why are you here? - To see Marie. - What's wrong? - Her arm's sore. It's the shopping basket or the frying pan! My God! It's so good to see all this again! Let's tease him! Doctor, these portraits are from my grandparents. I was deeply touched to receive them from the country after 40 years! Here's my great-grandfather! You've heard of Louis XVI? This isn't him. It's his aide-de-camp! That's one of my grandmother's grandmothers. He's not in the family! At least, I hope not! Here's an uncle who was the king's architect. You can be proud to bear a name that, don't laugh, was so famous! That's my aunt's mug you're looking at! - Charming! - No, I mean the silver mug! It's all quite interesting! May I drop by one morning and examine in detail your beautiful collection? You're a bit feverish! Are you ill? - A sick doctor! - See you soon! Soon? Lies... swollen pride, an extremely flushed imagination but no fever. - I was right! - What will I do? - Don't upset him! - I won't! What's going on? Good bye! No! Farewell! He always says goodbye! What's he up to? - What did he say? - We discussed Marie. What do you think of your ancestors? Quite unexpected! They impressed the doctor! And me? - Like the room! Unrecognizable! - But...? - Magnificent! - To that extent? I must tell you something overwhelming. - What? - Papa! Know why he came? Know what the servants told me? What? That while I was gone you'd gone crazy! - No! - Yes! How nice! - See how you impress them? - Yes. Because you change the furniture, wear a tux and smile! I joke and they say I'm crazy! Yes, a normal man should be unhappy. I'm happy, so they think I'm mad. The doctor... Doctors see only those who suffer and complain! They can't recognize healthy men! - What'd he say? - That you're futile! Naturally! It worries him that I'm cheerful! - Are you sad? - Not at all! I've thought about all this and... there's nothing that's worth being sad about. - You had a good trip? - Excellent! Good! You wired me you were in Milan on business. - You did some business? - No. True, this is no time for business. - You enjoyed yourselves? - "Ourselves"? Yes, you! The travelers! You weren't alone on the train! We must always think of others! Sorry, I misunderstood! Yes, I... I mean... we all enjoyed the good weather. I made the most of it! - It's a wonderful country! - Superb! Isn't the Doges' Palace overrated? - It's in Venice! - Yes, Venice! I'll have to go see it! Isn't it good to be alive? We should satisfy our need to live on the surface. We should even create such a need. We're such economical stay-at-homes! We think pleasure is only for foreigners... forgetting we're foreigners when we're abroad. - Free for dinner? - Well... - No? - Yes. - But... - But? - I'd like you to meet someone first. - Good! I like enlarging my circle of friends! It's a young lady I met... a few weeks ago at friends'. I met her again... two or three times. She's very simple and sweet! I meet nothing but charming people lately! She'd like a recommendation. - For whom? - Herself! To your lawyer friend Bonnardier! - Why? - A lawsuit! - Poor girl! - It's awful! - Lawsuits can last for ages! - At least! - I didn't think you'd say no. - Of course not! - I just met her by accident... - She came along by accident! Then go and get her by accident! - Do you mind? - Am I busy? - You'd say so? - Am I shy? Hurry up! Go! I'll get her! Lovely! Marie! Prepare the dinner! I want champagne! Flowers! The most charming dinner in the world! - Do you have some ice? - Some ice! Come in, miss! Please! Papa, this is the Miss Desmaret I mentioned. - What? Miss...? - Desmaret! Delighted to meet you and welcome you into my home! Please have a seat! My son says you'd like a recommendation to see my lawyer friend Bonnardier. - Yes, sir. - With pleasure! What's this about? It's about... Papa... I'm sure the young lady can explain... as well as you the reason for her visit! - You were saying? - Nothing! Nothing? I'm sorry! It's about... - What do they call it? - A lawsuit! A lawsuit, right? I'm not mistaken? A lawsuit! Good! You're the one filing the suit? Good! It's best to do it oneself! And you're suing whom? Yes... Who knows? File it! We'll find out later! I bet you're suing some people who didn't behave towards you as they should have! - Exactly! - That's how lawsuits usually begin! - Henrietta said that yesterday! - Henrietta? An old friend of Mama's! The old girl said it leaning on the balustrade in her garden! But let's get back to our lawsuit and the people who have wronged you! Well, sir... It's the people who live... above us and... let their bathtub faucet run on purpose... till it overflows... and the water goes through their floor... so that now... my dining room wallpaper is completely ruined! That's horrible! I'm heartsick! It's the lawsuit of the century! But we needn't bother my lawyer for this. In fact, I wouldn't even sue! I wouldn't do that! With people who've done that to me... I'd go away! I'd move! Move out! Change apartments! Try to find a new place! A place here in Neuilly near me! That way if you ever need some butter, I'll be nearby! And suppose I need something? You'd be just as close! Wouldn't you like a townhouse? Yes? Isn't my arrangement acceptable? Pleasant? Yes! I'm sure Maurice who's such a gentleman... would love to find you a townhouse! In recompense, once he's found it... I hope you'll let him live quietly with you... Let me finish! ...until you decide to legalize a situation... I already think is delightful! - Papa! - Papa what? I think two people who've been to Venice... You know? You big baby! I'm the one... We both arranged your trip there! YOU? When I told you to go away for a week... I'd just talked to her for 15 minutes! What? You dared do such a thing? Maurice, listen! - You did that? - Let me explain! - I'll listen to nothing! - What's this? I won't discuss it in front of you! Just a moment! This is an unfortunate incident but I want to know why you're so upset. - I can explain! - Be quiet! Where do you think you are? What's this behavior? - What's going on? - Sir, I came to see you but... - I didn't tell him! - So? After Venice, he made me swear I'd never lied to him. That's all? Good Lord! That's why he's so upset? - No? - Yes, papa! I can't bear her lying to me! I have so little faith in life and what I've just heard won't help! - I detest lies! - So Why'd you lie to me? - Me? - Yes, you! Why'd you say you didn't know her? Why did you force her to lie? Why did you say you were in Milan on business? You lied for no reason. She had an excuse! Her happiness! - She's an egotist... - Egotist? And you? - Me? - Yes, you! Like all the rest! When I advised you to take a trip, did you hesitate? Instead of one week, didn't you stay for two? You did it because of a feeling greater than any other! Your happiness! For you to lie and assert your egotism to such a degree... Congratulations! You must truly love her! I don't blame you! Nothing in the world is more natural! Lying, my boy? We all lie! For our benefit or pleasure! Yet there's a moment in life when we all hate lying! It's when someone lies to us! The word egotism makes you sneer. You're young! Actually, I raised you badly. I scared you! To spare you unhappiness, I kept you from being happy! But happiness depends on you! We're pretentious with children. We give them life and want to do more, as if it were possible! You'll see that with your own son! He'll see it too! And to think I did research on heredity because of you! How foolish! No wonder a child's like his father! All men are the same! To think I fought any possible influence of my father on you, whereas I can feel that influence rising irresistibly in me! The abominable things he said that I hid from you till now... I think I'll say them to you because... today they seem to be full of common sense and truth! I was like you. You'll be like me! My father was right! One day you'll be like me the way I'm becoming like him! But there's no hurry! You love and are loved! So be happy and let yourself go! The day I said being in love was serious, I lied! Nothing is serious except the death of others! I'm not asking you to trust in her but I beg you to trust in life because its resources are inexhaustible! Maurice, listen to me. I have suffered. I've suffered much more than I should have done. I did it deliberately so I could see what it was like, and to earn the right to say to you today, "Maurice, look at me. I swear to you that I'm happy." Let's eat. - Dinner is served. - You read my mind. THE END
