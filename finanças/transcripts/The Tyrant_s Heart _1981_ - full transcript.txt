THE TYRANT'S HEART THE TYRANT'S HEART OR BOCCACCIO IN HUNGARY # My sweet lord, there you hear it, # # we swearing onto stars of from the sky denied a hundred times, # # you cut our tongue out our mouth if we lie, # # we play it the way, # # hear the true story of our body and our blood # # Happened once that a beautiful lady, Katharine... # You stop the singing quickly if you listen to me. Because we were driven away from whole Italy because of these songs, from everywhere drove away. From Firenze, a Bologna, the wide world from everywhere. If you do not believe it,then all of the world most unfounded trade the barnstormer actors'. He write legends, gambols, is shouting, the most useless trade. It, that the dealer, the soldier and the farmer, they better appreciateds. After all the barnstormer actor the power ones tolerate it little. The thing is plain. The power ones want to hear that they are kind-hearted, beautiful, and just. If you are not repeating it more more frequently, ... aloud and for a long time and for them on a kind language ... you are crappy immediately then. And it better makes it if they think for a fool thee and do not hang thee. They tolerate the lie ... if you are made to dress for truth, beauty, goodness... since he may be that ally of theirs so only. Already I thought, that do not want to welcome my own homeland. See, see. They remember you here. You are a big lord. Everybody celebrates you. I remember nothing. Neither onto a colour, neither onto a flavour, neither onto a smell. After all as if I would have gone through all this already, as if I would have seen it already. Impossible. You were 2 year age when to us into a Bologna fetched. Sure that strange here for you. You want to remember, but it what you see all around here, like that as if it would be past time. Stop it, too clever what you say. I remember nothing. I get it after all to agree we what, who who. Who stands distant from the stick of the power ones, it stands near to the gods. Who stands distant from the stick of the power ones, it stands near to the gods. Father. Are you my father? Not, Gaspar. I am your father's younger brother, your uncle. Your father died. You could have seen him yet if you arrive earlier. Where is he buried? Then later lead. The bears tore him up during hunting. It was your mother there. Because of the horror become deaf and become voiceless. Carry! I want to see it! It is necessary to prepare it, she may have trouble if she sees suddenly yet. You leave it, comes to himself then. Who are you? His friend, from a Bologna. Please, keep silent. Our Gaspar tired. A long road is at a standstill behind you, right? Please, do it! He receives an Italy food until 1-2 days # Happened once, that a beautiful lady, Katherine, # The Bologna actors are here. How kind. Come on. Amuse, laugh, be playing. # And died purely as she lived. # # I swear on the stars, # # A husband and a wife waited for each other # Enough! # Their news expanded, some than the tales # Maybe that you may have all this played in Italy at you, but here at us no. From our folk all this outlandish. Take the mask off. Bravo, bravo! This was really superb. It is possible to understand nothing here. An instruction is given then what his contrary comes. A prestigious lord informs us that you do this. You come then, and you declare it, that prohibited. What is it necessary to do then actually? The archbishop a theoretical man, he may allow everything to himself. I am a practical man and I know how it is necessary to have a hold on the folk. The archbishop's uncle: the sibling of Gaspar's mother. He took it once to you, into Italy. Good, good, i see, but to understand nothing, that jabber. How are you Gaspar? Odd, what? Strange a place this here. One say this, other it. The barnstormer actors are here, who wanted to play. And onto this they kicked it, that here prohibited to play. A lord allowed it them before it though. See Gaspar, it only in what you may take delight, it only it only the women. So kind, so sweet, so soft. Is not so, Gaspar? I recommend myself. I am a wonderful boy, I am so kind, so high life, I am so distinguished, Do I not remember me? That you grew up! You are strong, man! I kept you on a whole road in my arm. I sent a letter to your father every day I was until a year with you in a Bologna Remember? Why did you lead there? Why? we read a lot Mekkavelli You were feared for because of Charles being your uncle's friends kill, if you stay here. You are the only boy. One single child. One single child. And last in the family. I want to see my mother. I said that you have to wait already! Your mother is ill very much. Your father's death him was mopes very much. I am sorry him, my mother! She suffers from a terrible nerve trouble. Our best doctors it is healed. Come! Taste our drinks, our foods. Recognise your home. Feel yourself at home. Did this kill my father? Not, we struck it dead then. The truth from your father's death we alone the family we know. The folk considers it a hero. He fell over the fight against the Turkish. In the protection of the faith. But why you lie? This is not a lie. The folk would not believe that the bear killed it. A big death suits a big man. Heroical death. And for a hero hero his son. - Is she my mother? - She. May I go there now? Not yet. I go away then. Strange. Very strange. Too young. She was bear a child it in his childhood, were not 13 year age yet. Very nice, like that than a queen. What do you want my friend? Why did you call him home? What do you think of why? What do you mean? Nothing. Go then have a rest! You Gaspar, be left yet! Be going calmly. Because of that called home, because you will be a Hungarian king. A stranger is sitting on the throne for a long time. The time came, that Hungarian let him take his place And why me? Because of that because the oldest family is our family. The hugest one. And the most noble, most glorious hero was your father. I am not skilled at this. You're wrong. All of your abilities is to it. More, as if you would have lived your 18 years here. You learned a lot. That way they were a teacher in order for you to see the world in his contexts Your friends live outside from who statesmen will be I know the geometry, the arithmetic... The politics is a very plain thing. The soul is the knowledge. The politics merely the body, for a strong soul easy to govern the body. Easy to learn and what we are here beside you. I'm sleepy. What happened? Shut up. Do not wake up Gaspar. What was that? What happened here? Better that sleeps now! Tell him it then tomorrow, his mother kills a girl every day She was left because of this young person like this. She eases at least so. Drink! I drank it already. Drink yet. You want it, that I will be drunk? Not, because I want to talk to you. Drink yet. I drank it already. Do you feel rather strong oneself? Tell me! Your mother kills a girl in the evening of everyday. Trust me! I saw it. The girl's blood flowed here my hand. I am sorry him, my mother! What do you say? Don't you get it? Your mother kills a girl in the evening of everyday. You answer it to this, that 'I am sorry him, my mother'? Here be watching! They are playing here, they are playing, Gaspar! Did you notice that it is true, not true here? Very much watch out, Gaspar! These sweep in, confuse. Look at! Now horses are brought over here! They are playing, they are playing only! Gaspar, how this is? I say your mother kills girls daily, you only mamma mia? Do I ask it! Right what my friend said? My uncle. Right what my friend said? Yes, right. Your mother, all evenings kill a girl. On that hunting you had a mother there when the bears killed your father. Sho is was badly. She does not speak since then. And is relaxed by it if she commits a murder only. But here at us cheap the girls. They sell one for a sheep already. But why? She from this heals. Is there not an other method? This is the only medicine. And the law? The law You will be the law. Will I be the law? So I should learn a new mentality?! You beautiful girls, I am glad about you so! Here in the beautiful women's country. Teach onto something! Or rather I you? You live! You did not die! You live! You live! You live! She lives! She lives really! Gaspar! Gaspar, you know what happened? The girl who your mother killed, she lives! What they did something for so then, as if it would have been destroyed? Do you understand this? I understand. They may have been twins presumably. Of course that there were twins. They were twins. Twins? Are you surprised? In our midst many twins are born They get married with each other. And where the corpse is? Did you not see the bonfires? The dead persons are burned, their bones are grind. They make a paint of him. What colour? Then bring for for you. Very much can be painted with them the actors' face. They want to kill. I come here for my friend's mood from Italy... Yes guffaw only me! Guffaw. Yes, yes, yes. To guffaw? But why? Who wants to kill you here? There is a weapon at nobody here. Yeah? And this here what? Excuse me! I forgot the tomato (*artifical blood*) But it then nearest! Good bye! What happened? My mother moved! She will heal. Be sure of yourself only. She heals! From you! There are radiation, strength in him! You will be our true and natural ruler. Hello! Does not hear a word, does not speak. A yes, she do not speak. The secrets of the nature are inscrutable. Let a man not investigate it. God knows what do you want. Calm down! What's going on here? Answer me, what's going on? I explain it. Your mother kills a girl in the evening of everyday. This is a sin. It is necessary to absolve it from it. Patient. I call doctors in from a Bologna. Not necessary. It is a best medicine if undertakes it, what our Lord (*Jesus*) undertook. The whipping. Gaspar! Gaspar, don't go! Please! Gaspar! Gaspar! Gaspar! He's dead! They killed it! You killed it! Do we call his mother? Call his mother. Yes, call his mother! Right it's not true, that you are murderous, my mother? Say that you are not it. Why do you not answer? I do not believe that you are dumb. What is made with you here, my mother? Brute! Did you mistreat the future Hungarian king? You die for this. To hold down! The future Hungarian king chops off your head with his own hand. Hold on! Take it! Come, bring your friend here. Let him chop off the head of this brute. You believe it, Gaspar would find it out to do? To kill somebody? Yet that to behead!? You do not know it neither he, neither Italy. They do not teach these things at us. No. The poison is the real one. It is much more humane. And does not flow the blood. I have truth, right G?sp?r? Right? Be laughing! Do not protest Gaspar! Sword free and you have to carry it! That protect your innocent folk and how the Turkish should dread you, than your father. Do Gaspar, you forgive this brute? Do Gaspar, you forgive this brute? But I do not forgive. What are you grieving about always? Get up! My uncle, I do not want to be a king! You will be a king though! Hungarian king. The best Hungarian king. I teach everything to you. I teach you to fence. Would he not be better if I would start the education? I am the best one in a dog, right? Come, hug our Turkish friend. You are surprised, Gaspar? Are you surprised at the fact that we are making friends with a Turkish? Why would he be surprised? A thing got acclimatized to Italy with a Turkish to make friends. The Italians dear people, right? And the strangers are not hated so than you. We are afraid from the Greeks. From Greeks? From the Turkishs. I did not bring a gift. I loved your father. I met him on the battlefront first. Was heroic, good fencer. Gaspar, you are like that totally than your father. We were never able to defeat each other. We were friends because of this possibly And we were your friends because of this I accepted Charles,it because of your father. Not big fighter like the one that he claims to be. Lover your mother, maybe even now. Do you not think that this is my private matter? You believe it, I tolerate everything? All this is so strange. So strange. Why would he be strange? Your mother loved your father very much. She became ill from his death. needs a doctor. I call doctors in from a Bologna. Not necessary. The eastern wise men know the therapy of this illness. Wife has to go the nearly his relative. Charles was amorous always into him. Who are you? And why you eavesdrop? I would not like G?sp?r to have trouble. I am the friend of one of the Italians. I give true one to you. I was audible accidentally what you said You know Lukrecius writes it: The best balm is the man's sperm for a spiritual ill woman. But let sperm be relational , it until all of them effective. You why joke? Did it seem a joke really? This is true so though. And is cured by him? Lukrecius swears on him, but I cannot decide it, that right or neither. It would be necessary to read it then. Coming here was worthy because of this already. I did not see a comedy like this in my life. Some other kind of than at us in a Bologna. Beautiful girls, and what kind of martial, bloody scene. Look at ours. These are not last! Hurrah at ours! The Italy comedians! He tells Boccaccio master's famous story to you now. Once upon a time, once was a beautiful unmarried mother, who loved two men, two siblings once. What you are glad about, Gaspar? I make the same one, that you. I laugh at it, that want to kill us. Why would they kill you? Maybe, that me yeah, but you? Hungarian king do. And this the Turkish? He was your father's friend. And my mother? Why it is added to my uncle for a wife? Maybe because of that , his lover dared for a long time. And you not too you are your father's son. What is fantasy. Why do you eavesdrop here? Look, you're beautiful. See Gaspar, this a country like this. This is a strange country. The habits are strange here. Our Italian actors. You may play it with his getting married occasion now. # Happened once that a beautiful lady, Katharine # # committed adultery my sweet lords, # # there was not a more faithful wife at him, # # and died purely, just some, as he lived. # # I swear on the stars, # # desired each other husband and wife, # Enough! This not the suitable occasion onto the smut. I prohibit it! Enough! Your mother loved your father in such a way that she escorted it even onto the battlefront many times. Charles sure everywhere his trace. He did not have his look taken off him. As he would have had a bodyguard. A stupid and headstrong man was whole in his life. I tell a story yet yet then. Your father gave this shield to me. We met on the battlefield. I defeated him almost, when I caught my face on the shield. I was horrified by myself. And I gave up the fight. Was so, I preserve it since then. As a relic. Charles proposed to onto something. Be careful with him. I will never do it, you may trust me only! You do not see it, that disturb? Go away! Go away! I took a liking to you very much, Gaspar! I see your father in you always! Charles that way asked for, how I shall have you destroyed! But I would never be able to do this. He called home, for what would want to kill? Everybody is listening. Everybody eavesdrops. My son! My sweet son! My son. Called it me: my son. My son. The miracle occurred. The miracle occurred. Your mother speaks again. The miracle occurred. Your mother speaks again. Very difficultly. Softly, but speaks. Go to your mother. Be very tender to it. Go! Go! Go! Wait! Did the Turkish talk about the shield to you? Did not know your father, never saw it. I had the shield made for him. I read in a very old Persian tale. But this shield in a fight cannot be used. But why said it then? The Turkishs are like this. Said it, that I want to kill? Yes. He's Iying. A word of his is not true. Their way of thinking is like this. Go, go! I leave you alone with your mother! go! I dreamed about you always in a Bologna. But I was not able to imagine that you are beautiful one and a young person! I love you, my mother! I love you, my mother! I love you, Gaspar! Now, that you speak again, you tell everything to me? From yourself, from my father. Right it's not true, that you commit a murder in the evening of everyday? Tell me! I am your son. I have to know what happened to my father. You went in the forest... You went onto hunting... In a forest the bears... Bear?... red-white horse, not bear The bears tore up my father. But the folk thinks that he fell over the fight against the Turkish. I have to know that he died. Got it? Yes. The moon was shining, a big white lamp... What lamp? My mother! What happened to you, my mother? Answer me! Please! Answer me! what you made with him? I tear you up! What did you make with him? The bear! What bear? We took back the bears into the preserve already. Honey, honey! Calm down honey! Calm down, please. Calm down! Calm down! Don't be afraid, I never leave you alone longer! You hear me? Will he be good? Say that he will be good. She does not answer. She does not answer. She does not hear. what you made with him? What did you make with him? Did you rape it? Because wanted to can from him something? You slept with your own mother? Because you think that I had your father killed? Did you believe it? Did you believe it? Calm down. Charles do not irritate yourself! Gaspar do think of nothing bad! Your father died there in the forest, his corpse was not found. Your Charles uncle your best friend. Your true friend, do not be angry at him! He prepared for this wedding until years And now your mother will be ill again. But be cautious about the archbishop. He would like you to be a king because he would like to rule instead of you because of that. I'm feeling sick! You may not feel badly! You have to be a ruler with a hard hand! For an one with a hard hand! We send your Italian friend from here, he misleads. He wants to make you sceptical. Just like the Turkish's, your father's friend. He did not know my father. But knew it, did not like it only. The archbishop was his best man always. Let onto myself! The Hungarians die rather. The Turkish is received for their sibling rather, since let a stranger be elected... ...for a king. Why do you guffaw? It, that it is written onto my grave: The Hungarian king's best friend lies here. No. We dig a grave for other ones here. Bravo! Beautiful sight, when the intellectual draws a sword. No. It I am slightly weak yet. Weak and after all like that,than his father. Why it disturbs you Turkish, that our ruler will be weak, you are maybe you are glad about this? The first does not make it be raining, right Italian? Why should a literate be a king? He may find a neater trade. Go to take a bath, you became hot too much. This is my opinion, actor. All right, fine. Thank you Turkish, you are a darling, you are very kind. Want to kill? Yes, want to kill. You know Italian, in Hungary not into water blown the guest. Come, sit beside me. Be calm, don't be afraid! I would like to relate something. He is my man. He keeps watch till then while we talk. He? But why a back hurt me then? It was Charles's command. Your Charles uncle double-dealing man, wants you to be a king because he wants to reign instead of you. Let us listen to your singer. # Happened once, that a beautiful lady, Katherine, # # ommitted adultery, my sweet lords, # My aims ambitious. Its determine the whole world's fate. I have very good contacts with Rome and my money yes. I want to be a pope and I will be a pope. Myself have it elected. I make you a Hungarian king before, then emperor. All power will be two in his hand and nobody the Turkish may not be doing against us, yet. Your Charles uncle negotiates with them, this Turkish visits us because of this so cosily. My uncle hates it and considers it a liar. Charles's all of words are lies. After the coronation dazzles, he has lead poured into your ear or kills. Gaspar, you do not come to dance? Go! Sing though for me. Do you betray me? Not holy lord, but this command. Who negotiates with the Turkish, archbishop lord? Who wants to kill the new Hungarian king, archbishop lord? The archbishop died. Is he dead? His heart...? There was a suicide. How? Deranged. Called it me many times if he would not attain the throne papal on 50 year age, destroys himself. He was aged 50 yesterday. Roman character. My uncle, is trouble. He was suicidal, did you hear that? You want to ask you it something. Leave me alone onto ourselves! Speak! Speak! Speak! Speak! # And the noble lord ran onto far land, # # distant his love, how he should suffer there, # # distant his love, that let him show an example, # # cleared up onto an impulse, # Speak! # cleared up onto an impulse, # Speak! Please, speak! Speak! Please, speak! Speak! Speak! Guards! Guards! Guards! Guards! Charles! Charles! Remember what we said? This blood This blood No, no, no, no Not bad, better than the tomato. Who are you? My friend from Venice. Why does a Turkish wear dresses? This is the fashion now in Venice. Right? Of course, that right. This is the latest fashion in Venice. Got it? The Turkish clothing is a fashion. # For ?rt?r's younger brother sees faithful Katherine, # # felt a unearthly torment in his heart, # # dared for haunting his torment for the lady flames, # # but gets the shiver from himself. # What do you want from me? Only the truth. What happened to my father? Your mother loved me, but I gave it to your father. Your father was jealous and wanted to kill your mother and fell into his own sword. Good. Say the true one. The Turkishs drew it from the camp, ... ...and we never saw it longer. I did not want to say it only, dared with the Turkishs truth friendship this is very important for us. I did not want you against the Turkishs to instigate. Did you want to say this? You say that it is necessary to battle against the Turkish, isn't it? That's it, say the true one! I say the true one. Your mother loved me, your father him. That let us decide it let whose be, we dueled. I was the stronger one and the smarter one in the duel and I killed your father Did you want to say this? Yes. This was so. You lie at random. I want to know the true one. You've killed him or you had it destroyed? I tell the true one to you. I loved your mother, but your mother loved my older brother and I made my men kill my sibling. Bravo! Bravo! You are my son actually! You are my child! So your father here before you! Did you want to say this? My sweet son! My sweet son! Do you not want to kill your father? My sweet son! I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared! Leave it. Do not kill it. Only an actor. Do not kill it. He played a role. Dying for this would be a too big price. Only a little one is an actor. He never hurt nobody. What speak my mother? Did he hurt nobody? What speak my mother? Your mother? Did you believe it of me really? I am younger at you. You're lying. Say that you lie. Ask the Turkish, knows it. I take nothing already. There is nothing, which I would understand, on the Earth. They are actors. You tell it, who understands this? Maybe you? We were stupid. How we believed in the fact that we can manipulate the manipulating ones!? Right that my mother... ...this is the girl said? Right, right. Actors. I had them brought from Turkey. He plays your uncle. He though your mother. But why? Why? Why? We need a king hold of who we can have. They need a Hungarian king hold of who they can have. You killed my father, my mother. No, no. Do not think that your father died. He not dead! Live! The Turkish is your father! Run! Run! My sweet son is the end of the game! A Hungarian king may not be from you! You are weak and you are looking for a some kind of explanation behind everything. Because a king may not dream what he wants, but that maybe. And not too that maybe, but that is needed. Got it? That is needed, got it? You do not have to kill it. You are his father finally. He would not have been needed. But dip your hand into him his blood. The sultan's instruction. - So everybody has to die? - For everybody. For the Italians, the servants, Katherine, Charles, everybody. The tactics of the land be burnt to ashes, not to leave a trace. I, Ozorai Guti Gaspar why was Turkish? Take it off! You have to die! Because you selected a bad star! The sultan's instruction. Let us be afraid of our friends... ...yet then, if... ...not a gift is brought. # We do not have tears already, # # our eyes only and phantoms float away before them # # There are not fog, dresses is not already, # # look at, be watching and see it, # # see what we became, # # see it, what our obsessed managers become, # # if they run out it deluding, # # and not ... maybe another time, # # because he is not another time, # # because he is not another time, # # because he is not another time, # # My sweet lord, there you hear it, # # we swearing onto stars of from the sky denied a hundred times, # # you cut our tongue out our mouth if we lie, # # we play it the way, # # hear the true story of our body and our blood # # And the noble lord ran onto far land, # # distant his love, how he should suffer there, # # distant his love, that let him show an example, # My friends! It's not true, how this rotten life does not have happy minutes. It's not true. What you say to this feast? Well let us play for an end then. Okay? These booby Hungarians do not understand it anyway. These will not understand a word of the lecture. We may speak calmly, a word is not meant in Italian. We may open our mouth already now. What is an audience! To play for deaf. Look over there. Look at that! This is not a so bad country finally. Right? Yeah! Bravo! We may eat, we may drink, we may devour. And we may paw the world's most magnificent daughters. My friends! I'm sorry, but the end of the comedy! Yes, yes, it is over, unfortunately. The best, if we go away. Yes, come. We go, Gaspar. Come! We did not play it finally Boccaccio. But you are not sorry for it, right? Do not be sorry for it. Insert these feathers in your ass as a souvenir though. All right, we go! Come on, we go! Hey, why you locked us? Why did they not allow us to go away? To lock poor actors! Open it. Come on! And you? What do you want alone with this blunderbuss? We leave it here and run! Come on!
