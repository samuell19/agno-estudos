Do you know what dark matter is? No It's matter, it's something that is there but you cannot see. It's all over the universe. And the only influence, matter or energy it has is gravity. I would like to be able to sleep. Right now, millions, billions of particles of dark matter are passing through our body. Come on. Focus. Every second, they pass, every second of our lives probably till we die and maybe even further on. You made me get lost. How was it? C? G minor? - No, I don't remember. - Me neither. Melody. What was the tone? Wait, don't rush me. Slower. High five! Techno! Mom! Axel! Come down to hang out with me for a while. Alice! Axel! Come on, come down! What are you doing? Nothing. My voice got like this. Can you hear what my voice sounds like? Sing something, so I know you're there. Which one do you want? The one about the Colla? Whichever you want. That was beautiful. Very beautiful. Is it yours? No. It seems as if it were yours. Why? I don't know, it's just a way of paying you a compliment. You have to learn to take a compliment. Thank you very much. What's wrong with you? Nothing. You have to learn to take a compliment. It is something good. Like a friend of mine used to say he didn't know how to manage compliments. You need to learn to manage compliments. So? What do you think? What do you think about what I'm saying? Why don't you make some noises? Why don't you move a little? You just stand there, like a statue. He's gone again… Why do I even ask you to keep me company if I can't even hear you, I can't tell if you're there or not? Axel, are you there? Why don't you…? Axel, have you left? Goddamn! Okay, forget about all the things I just said. All the nice things I've said, wipe them off your memory. What? Is that you? Why do you knock like that? Come on, cut it out! Axel, cut it out! I can tell you're doing it on purpose. Are you there? I've can no longer hear anything. There it is, it's back. So, now I'll ask you to repeat some words, okay? - Cardboard. - Cardboard. - Bowtie. - Bowtie. - Seal. - Seal. - Shotgun. - Shotgun. - Order. - Order. - Part. - Part. - Grandson. - Grandson. - Berry. - Berry. - Card. - Card. - Serious. - Serious. - Theme. - Theme. - Fifth. - Fifth. - Eloquent. - Delinquent. - Egocentric. - Egocentric. - Piaget. - Piaget. - Mark. - Mark. - Braid. - Braid. - Venus. - Venus. Come here! Madam? Madam? Madam? Life in the Loire River estuary in 1930s France is peaceful and undisturbed for the group of friends that star in this beautiful film about hope and the gift of life. Of course, the forbidden love that brings turmoil among the townsfolk had to be there. No, I don't like it. Something else, come on. Mister Delasalle is a school principal who lives with his wife and his mistress, Professor Horner. Both women, tired of his constant... Another one, stop, stop, stop. Another one. Well, you don't like anything. Don't read everything, I can tell right away. There's a woman with a baby in her arms. We'll not a baby, more like a seven-year-old. They are both kind of reddish blondes. Her gaze is lost, and in the background there… Stop. I've already told you, not that one. “Diabolique”? What the hell is that, Alicia? What are you doing? Put Eduardo on the phone, he knows. Eduardo is not here, there's a replacement. I'm only asking for a film! I'm freezing to death here. I don't know what's wrong with the heating. Take the Nutradorm, take three. And put on the blankets I gave you and you'll be fine. Which blankets? Besides the Nutradorm's no good! I got to go, Mom. Bye, I'll call you later. Say “iron”. I'll take these. Okay. And what are you doing there? I'm playing. SO LONG ENTHUSIASM …like when you stay out of something but with a light effect. Right… That's cool. I've got an early morning tomorrow. But tomorrow's Sunday. Still, I gotta work. What a pity. Well, then… Well, then … It was a nice afternoon. I really enjoyed it. Whenever you want me to go with you, let me know. Okay. Did you like the ending? Yes. In the country. Sorry? The country. Can I go in for a cup of tea? But I gotta get up early. Okay. Careful with the hand. I don't want to squeeze your fingers. So, Bruno. See you around. - Let's talk during the week. - Okay. I was thinking about some stuff to tell you. Okay, good. - What's up? - Did I lend you a lighter? Let me see. I think I gave it back to you. No, right, it's here. Here. Bye. Now's your turn. Very good! Very good. Someone's here. She says she's cold. Who is it? That her bones ache. It's Antonia, Mom. That sculpture you made is horrible. It's not you. What's up, Mom? I need to get out. Don't start. Have you taken the Nutradorm? She says it's too mild, it doesn't take effect. Take three then, or four. I've taken twenty, Antonia. Just relax then. She's right, twenty will knock you out. You stay out! The heating is broken! - Go get her some blankets. - I'm freezing to death! Let's go to the window, Mom. Okay. Don't get the brown one. Why do they put it on if they won't fix it? I don't get it. - What's that noise? - The door, the hinge's broken. You're gonna break it! No, I won't. It's already broken. They don't fix it but just leave it here. Mom? Come over to the bathroom. They are getting you the blankets. You'll need to get me an electric blanket. So? Have you found them? Michel hasn't called, right? No, Grandma called. Don't listen to that old hag. Pull from the blanket, Mom. I'm pulling. Be good to me, okay? But I'm good to you! I got almonds at Jorge's. Well done! Where did you get the money? Alejandra gave it to me, her dad gave her money. You don't say a word to your fathers. What's going on in here? Nothing, she's cold. Hi Mom, I got you the movies. Hi, thank you. Girls, why don't you get a good book for Axelito? He made a mess in the living room. There's clay everywhere. He's making an utterly distasteful sculpture of you. Did you make me fat? It's not you, it's Antonia. So it was me, that monster you made. It's Antonia! I don't want you using my image for your sculptures. Use Alice or Alejandra. - The girls aren't as special as you are. - I don't care. He makes compliments now. The little man. I'm hungry. Will you bring me something, Ali? No, not me, I'm always going. Besides, Axelito left a mess in the fridge. I'm not going. You keep the bread in the freezer. - That's to preserve it, douche bag. - That's not serious. - Grandma told me. - Grandma told you, so what? Grandma's a liar. That's what Mom told me. Mom, you shouldn't tell him stuff like that. Why not, if it's the truth? But he repeats it. It's all right if he repeats the truth, it's the lies one shouldn't repeat. Ali, will you serve me, please? It's always me. It's the last time you use my image for a work of art, got it? Use Alice or Alejandra. I won - Bruno! - Hey. - What's up? - Not much. Wanna come up? Okay, yes. Hi. Why are you wearing my Dad's sweater? It's too big for you. I found it and put it on, what's wrong? Bruno's here. Hi Ale! - Where? - In the living room. Did you let him in? Hey, Mom, you alright? So-so. Her bones hurt. That much? I'm bored. My bones hurt and I'm bored. And this book is a piece of shit. Stop giving me crap to read. You always get me shit to read! Those natural pills are no good for her. - Hi. - Yes, they are mild. Give this to her. No, they are no good. There, Mom. I want some. I need the paregoric. Then go and get some. Ricky's here, Mom. - Hi, Ricky. - Hi. Sorry I'm greeting you like this. - Do you want some Brazilian nuts? - No. Ricky has heartburn, it'll upset him if he eats. Oh, right, poor thing. - You need to take baking soda. - Right. No, baking soda's no good. It'll give you gas. That's right. …what I told you we were thinking, but I can wait here if you're busy. I can sit here. No, no. Stop it. Stop. Okay. What are you doing here? Mom wants the dress with the little horses. So? She says you have it. No, Alejandra's been wearing it. Hi, Axelito. How does he know my name? Who is he? His name is Bruno. How are you? What have you told him about me? What does she want the green dress for? - For her birthday. - It's her birthday? In three days' time. So what then? Nothing, just… You've made these, the sculptures? - Yes. - They are very nice, congratulations. And the maps too? Yes. I play chess, were you playing? That's Alice's, but yes, I was playing with Alejandra. Whenever you want we can play a game, I love chess. Who invited you over? Was it Antonia? Sort of, but yes. - Are you a friend of Ricky? - Ricky Reiner? I don't remember his last name. That's nice. Not again. Here we go again? Who's singing? Alejandra? She's good, I love it. Yes, my sister. That's good. So if Alejandra didn't invite you and you're not Ricky's friend what are you doing here? I came to talk with Antonia. …To put on some kind of emotional eclipse on the other person, there is something that's got to do with your willpower. At that point you apply some kind of… I see it like an eclipse because it's like a replacement, but at the same time you start to forget the other person. The water is coming out cold here. Are you using the tap? I'm right here. Aren't they using it in the kitchen? And I'm also in a way provoking that detachment of the body I was telling you about. It always happens when you picture something, then incorporate it and then you have to weed it out somehow and there is some kind of transposition. But you are not a role model when it comes to flexibility, so I won't listen to… With regards to flexibility, yes I am… Not with my body, I am constantly working… And I got this buzzing in my ear. What? I got a buzzing in my ear. Your ear hurts again? For a while now. You have such an inflexible mind, right when I'm talking to you about this. That's how your body speaks. Haven't you seen Adela? Because this thing that's bothering you right when I'm talking about this… “I have a strong suspicion that you are still carrying about that claim” “of the ideal large as life, in your coat-tail pocket.” Come, come everyone. You're all beautiful, come. Hello! Hi, you look gorgeous. You are the Queen of this party. So now the guests will give her a present. It looks so good on you! So beautiful! What's this? Glasses? It looks like a helmet. Sunglasses. Hold on, I got it wrong. Now we get that right. There is something about this that was shaped… It was erased… I don't know, it's like I don't feel enthusiasm anymore. I will abduct you to my planet and you won't be able to resist the temptation to depart Earth When you erase something off a sheet of paper there's always a trace left. Something will remain. What's your name, monster? …that died, yet you still hear that dog bark or expect so when you're about to do certain things. The habit is engrained, so you know that if you go out the dog will bark. But the dog is gone, so it won't bark anymore. - Why are you crying? - Nobody's crying. Why are you here? I told you to stay there. I brought a blanket. What's up, Mom? Have you seen my medicine case? Where have you hidden it? See if there's some Elixir left. I thought you couldn't take that. I said I could take it on my birthday. But it's in three days' time. So what? We can celebrate today. But your birthday is the day after tomorrow. I don't care. The celebration does not need to be the same day. You can't decide when you were born. But birthdays are ultimately a convention. In other cultures, birthday celebrations can last a whole week. Wedding celebrations can go on for a month Birthdays that last days. And the celebration is something one can decide when to do it. But it's in three days' time. What do I care if it's in three days or in a year? Well, today's my birthday, then. Don't mirror me. Besides, we're closer to my birthday than to yours. What about the clafoutis? Go get the little box. I need four! But there's only one left. Tell Alejandra to buy more. Tell Alice to go and don't come back. Right now? Okay, but in three days' time… Cut it out, come on. Go now. Now three days from now, you'd better not ask for anything. Hey, you gotta knock! I knocked but you didn't hear. What do you want? I came to borrow a blanket. No, I gave them all to Mom. - But she's cold. - Okay. Don't touch the piano. Come, give me a little kiss. No, with the mouth. You little bird. Tweet tweet tweet. You're a little bird. Has anyone ever told you you've got a little bird's face? No. A nice little bird. Yeah? That's good. Yes. How are you? Fine. He wants to possess a body! No! A boy or a girl? A boy! I have to cover myself, so that it doesn't get me. Cover yourself. Please, cover yourself, so it doesn't get you. I'm scared! I'm so scared! I'm scared too, give me some sheet. I am so scared! PAREGORIC ELIXIR I should've bought more cigarettes. Let's head back then. Will there be more guests or are we the only ones? Ricky. Ricky Reiner? What I heard, it wouldn't let me sleep… A song I listened to the whole time… I don't know why, because I hadn't been listening to that but it came to my mind, that Oasis song. And it was that song all the time. It felt as if it were playing, as if it were on and playing. As if it were playing in my head. Just like the recorded song. And I think there must be an exact number… Ale, hi. Hi. I got lucky. Hi. - How are you, Marta? - I forgot the key. I've been ringing for hours, nobody ever answers. - I brought chocolates. - Perfect. - Is he your boyfriend? - No. No, I'm Bruno. Hi, Bruno. How are you? Fine. I'm Marta. Don't treat me as if I were a horse! We know you don't like Santosa. I can ask, can't I? She's fixated with the Santosa. She's got some trauma. Besides, I'm not free, what are you saying? You're hung up on that! I'm not free, I just try to keep an open mind. I'm curious, if you like. No, curiosity is something else. Axelito's curious, see? That has nothing to do with it. - Yes, it does. - No, it doesn't. It does, because Axelito and I are very similar. He likes the same things I do, he dislikes the same things. He loved me the moment he was born even if it pains you to admit it. Say that you loved me the moment you were born. I remember that when I was born I saw my aunt and I loved her. I love her now. So beautiful what you say, Axelito. An incredible memory. He opened his eyes and he loved her. You're so cute. No, get out, leave me alone. Sorry! He's so shy! How come you'll celebrate it today? Why? What difference does it make to you? But why will you do it earlier? It's a convention. You were born on one date, why do we have to do it earlier? What's the problem with that? I want to do it earlier. I don't know, I think it's wrong. Everyone knows you were born on a certain date. Why would you want to change that? I don't get it. It's just three days. Don't start. Okay. Careful. - It's hot. - Careful! - The smell! - Please! Here you go, Mom. Hand it to me. Happy birthday! Thank you, Ali. Who's going to call Silvia Cobelo? Not me. - Alice! - Not me. - Yes, you, Alice. - I always call her, why me? Come here, little baby. I can do it myself. Sorry, don't you like it when your favorite sister dries you up? We are a clean family. Will you come out? Hold on, I'm coming. Have you changed, Alice? Yes, but first I gotta make a call. I dare you to drink this. - No. - Come on! Try it and tell me what it tastes like. So? Come on! That smells awful! Do you have to take that? You'll love this smell in ten years' time. Like a Grandpa's cologne. Hello, Silvia? Hello, Silvia Cobelo. Hello, Silvia Cobelo. I'm calling to tell you that though we don't really like you and you're a bit loud deep down we care for you so we want to invite you to Mom's birthday party today here between the bathroom and the hallway and we need a lot of noise a lot of loud guests. We're counting on you, Silvia, Cobelo. Axel, here, look at the camera. Ruben? - What was his name? - Bruno. - Bruno! - Yes? Antonia wants to tell you something. Can you go in there and get that long grating? And the green one And the short one. Those three. - You go through here. - Here? No, here. Okay. He'll need help. - Ricky, can you help us here? - Yes. Careful with the pots. What are you doing? Get the gratings he'll give you and place them there. Careful with the pots. And now that green one. Excuse me, you can't take the gratings. They belong to the building. Sorry. Careful. Hold on, Bruno. Get that one. Anything else? We can ask him to get that one. And that long brown one, too. Stop it! Stop the noise! Hey! We're done, sorry. Such a fuss for a piece of wood. Thanks a lot. Where do you want to put this? Let me see. We'll need some trestles. Trestles or something to hold them. - Benches. - Benches or something. In Axelito's room. - Over there? - Yes. Go help him out. So lazy. Who's this one? That's Judy Tyler. Judy died in a car accident when she was 24. This is Vivien Leigh. She had tuberculosis and was bipolar. She dated Lawrence Olivier. They had a stormy affair. And another early death. She was arranging some flowers. She loved “decoring"… So she goes to some friends who were at her place and tells them she needed some rest or some lie, I forgot. So she went up to her bedroom and when they opened the door they found her dead. - Wow. - Yeah. Lawrence later talked to the coffin and said he was sorry for all the abuse. The day I was born, another blonde baby was born in the same clinic, so my Dad was constantly checking this mole I have here, see? So that he could make sure I was me, and not the other baby. Back then they weren't as careful as these days. You have to guess which one is me in my elementary school picture. Let's see. Hold on. This one. No, not that one! No? I can't find you. This one. No, this one. I was kidding, I'm not there. It was a joke to see if you knew what I looked like. You failed the test, Ricky. It's a cousin who lives in Paris. You always look better when seen from above, don't you think? I don't know, maybe. That's why when people take selfies, they do so from above. Didn't you want to look like Mom when you were little? Your Mom and I were very much alike. And very opposite too. We had the same friends, the same enemies. - The same boyfriends. - Boyfriends too? Well, of course. We got bored otherwise. Right, it was a different time. - It was customary then. - What? It was customary then. It was a different time. - It's done now too. - To share boyfriends between sisters. It was the latest trend then. You would've liked that. You had such a glow in your eyes. I thought you were full of promise. My dad said you'd be a doctor because you could take tough decisions and talked about complex issues. Your dad said that because he wasn't capable of taking a decision and couldn't talk about anything but himself. Stories repeat themselves. Like with Margarita and Saulo. Weren't you just fucking Saulo? Or was he your boyfriend? I dated Saulo for a month before your Mom stole him from me. A month, that's nothing! - Maybe I was a little slow… - How many weekends are there in a month? - It was a month. - There are four Saturdays in a month. - Four Fridays and four Saturdays - An intense month is like… He told me he didn't want kids. After a month you were already talking about kids? He was the one who taught me, listen to this… Be careful what you're going to say. He taught me how to whistle with my fingers. Oh, right. I don't know how you can walk with those. Don't you know how to knock? Close the door! I'm getting changed! This looks good, right? I didn't get make-up on my face. You got make-up on your face. It seems Pietro and Luisa are coming. Was Simón a good fuck? You can't ask me that! - Come on, tell me! - You're crumpling the dress. Was he a good fuck? Did you take a shower? I didn't get make-up on my face. Was he a good fuck? She wants to know. I won't answer that. - Why not? - Because. - It's intimate. - But he's not here. Come on, was Simón a good fuck? I won't tell you. Your panties were all red and Mom was not there so you had to show them to your dad. Shut up! You're making it up. That's a total fabrication! Total! - Who is it? - Antonia? No, Alice. Hi, Alice, how are you? Is this Antonia's room? No. And is Antonia there? No. Can you please tell me where her bedroom is? Check in the kitchen or go upstairs to Axelito's workshop. She loves the sculptures, she must be there with Axelito. That's good. But I don't think she's upstairs I didn't see her from the living room. Then I don't know what to tell you, my friend. Just leave me alone. Sorry. If you see her, tell her that I'm in the living room and I want to talk to her. Okay. I love you with all my heart. You are an extension of myself. What? You're watching too much television. Too many DVD's. Remember when Alejandra was watching the soap opera and Mom walked in and she was like fucking a pillow? Cut it out! That's not true! You made that up! I'll vouch for Alejandra. “Because you'll reach the unknown. You'll discover a language.” “This language will be from the soul for the soul.” “Summing up everything, scents, sounds, colors" “thought after thought, latching and pulling.” Is this an improv? “You'll discover the unknown in the measure” “of universal consciousness.” And in the universe. That was beautiful, girls! I loved it! Very intense. Thank you. Thank you very much. One Two One, Two, Three Will you tell me who's here? Everyone's here, Mom. Everyone you invited. - Patti's here. - Haroldo. I can even tell you there are surplus guests. And who would those be? We can leave. Who's a surplus guest? Who, for instance? For instance, Antonia invited Bruno. You're a snotty little fucker. How are you, Bruno? Thanks for coming. Are my girls treating you right? Hello. Hello? Margarita. Hello, Margarita. Thanks for the invitation. They are treating me fine, and you've got a lovely house. So cute, thank you, darling. He'll only stay for a little while. He has to go. Antonia, maybe he doesn't want to go yet. Antonia, it's at times like these when you need to get out of yourself and observe the situation from outside. What are you talking about? You're unable to see yourself from outside. What are you saying, Mom? You need to realize when you're being rude. That's why I'm saying this. - I'm saying this so that you can see… - That's right, Antonia. - It's good to see yourself from outside. - You have to judge yourself. - You know, Marga, I'm working on that. - I love your bijoux, Silvia! Lili gave it to me. Do you remember Lili, Marga? Lili, the one who threw parties? - Yes, remember? - Of course I remember! Two weeks they lasted! It was wonderful. They are no longer like that. I don't know Marta, if you know someone at a publishing house.. Marta's got lovers at publishing houses. Whose lovers? - She's got a couple of lovers. - Shut up! I can ask Miguel, but it's a publishing house that specializes in horticulture. - I don't think it'll work. - I have a great idea for… But maybe he knows someone. Right, that's what I'm saying. It might work or not, it depends. It might work, since you have such a flowery prose! What did she say? What did you say, Marta? Mom, are you happy? Happy birthday! We love you, Mom! Let's make a toast! A toast to Mom! Shut up, we're singing the “Happy Birthday”! Let's make a toast. I don't have a glass! Never mind. - Cheers! - To Marga. Symbolic cheers! Axelito, get a little sip. Cheers! To yet another year, Marga. Thank you! Cheers! They would poison the others, so when they toasted, the drinks got mixed and if one died, they all died. You are not that bright either. You're speaking nonsense! We don't have any other boy to compare with. Marga! Now let's pretend you're blowing the candles. - I have no problem with that. - Okay, you go, Bruno. - You can't go out. - Not you, Margarita. Let Bruno go! Then stop nagging me with the wine. Deal with it yourselves. - Right on, Marga. - Thanks, Ricky. I'm a wallflower, Marta. What's wrong now? That boy's got a mother. Nobody's saying otherwise. If no one raised him, then what role do I play? - Now you'd be an absent mother. - And some other times too. Then why the fuck did you come? What a birthday present. Stop now, let's sing the “Happy Birthday”. Come on. Marga! Go Marga! - Did you like that, Marga? - I liked it the first time. - She loved it. - Thank you. Good. Now you move around. Move around freely…. Good, when I say... Come on, move, move. When I say “stop”, you'll freeze. Come on, move, move. Experience your feelings. Move around. Stop! Good. Axelito. I never met Antonia's father. And I think that's a world of hers that is unknown to me. Lately she's been very absorbed with her love problems. Every time she speaks to me or my Mom, she seems to be angry. But we didn't do anything to her. Alejandra is more into her look than anything else. And she and Alice are kind of lost. Alice is more interested in the problems but she's younger. Move around Antonia as if you were a satellite. Good, now start to spin around. And now, move around Alice. Now, around Ale. Careful with the lamp. Good, good. Now stop. What did you feel? I felt dizzy. Which one made you feel better, or worse? None of them. Why? Because. The exercise works with what we feel so try to put those feelings into words. Antonia, choose someone to represent your father. Haroldo. Good, now, Haroldo move around the space. And whenever you feel it, face Antonia. Look at her. Say the first thing that comes to your mind. Undulations. What do you feel, Antonia? Fine, I think that's fine. Anything else? Good. Now Alicia. Thank you, Haroldo. Choose someone to represent your father. Bruno. - Do you agree? - Yes. Bruno? Please walk around and whenever you feel it, face Alice. Say the first thing that comes to your mind. - Who? - Bruno. Alice? Tired legs. Anything else? Now we move around. We move around. Stop! Now you will choose someone to represent your mother. But I'm right here. But you should be in here, in here. You can't choose someone to represent me if I'm present. If I'm right here. I don't feel represented by anyone there. No, no. I won't… Margarita, why don't you let us do this? Everything's fine here. I've got the situation under control. Well, things are not that fine in here! Let me go out. Come on, Antonia, I mean it. Why don't you respect the rules of the game? Why would I respect anyone if you don't respect me? Why the fuck do I speak to you? Calm down, calm down! What if we let her out? Let her out. And then she goes in again. That'll be the best. You're killing me! Or she'll drive us crazy. - Only for a little while. - A little while. Mom, now you're going to get out to do the exercise and then you go back in. Perfect, love. I get out, I hang out with you, we do the exercise but I stay out for a while, because I miss you. I want to hang out for a while and then I go back inside. No, Mom. Let's leave it like this. I know what will happen. Forget it. Let's resume. I mean it, Antonia. Let me out. Come on, Margarita. Don't ruin things. Axelito? Silvia Cobelo. Axelito, not you. Don't play along. Mom, it was you who set the rules. Stop it! Then change them. It's my house. Don't mess with Axelito. You're out of line, boy! Move in a circle. Can you hear me? When you feel it, you stop. Do you want some more? Who do you want to talk to? Let's see if you can go on with this noise. To Alicia. You'll have to remember I'm here, even if I have to break the door. How are you? I don't know. Why Ali? - What? - Why is it that you don't know? Because I'll start to cry and I don't want to. Cry, Alicia. I love you very much. I know. I miss you. But we are right next to one another. You know what I mean. I don't know, I don't like this. It upsets me. I don't want to cry. Say something to your mother. Come tell me here! Come tell me here! Listen, I don't have the energy to argue with you right now I'm in a state of connection. Will you let me work? You have no idea, Marta. Stop that show. Have you let off steam now? Can we resume? I will blow off when you open the door. Come on. You make up shit, you have no idea. Stop it, it's not Silvia Cobelo. I don't care. Let me out. Stop. We incorporate all the sounds, we integrate everything. Come on, open the door! We imagine there's meteorites falling from the sky. Axelito, to your sculpture... The last time I saw you you moved and were alive but... You know what? I don't want to tell her anything. I'm tired of this game! What a shitty birthday! Stop! Your kids are here. What's that got to do with it? I've got nothing to hide from them. Mom, I don't want to listen to you anymore. See how she talks to me? Don't torture her! I'm the one that's tortured, Silvia Cobelo! - Shall we go, Silvia? - Okay, let's go. Why did you even come? It's good that you came, so I can see the kind of friends I have. You didn't even get me a present. Again with that? I told you I'll send it to you. You're irritating Well, you never sent any present, so let's assume you don't make presents. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know why you butt in because I'm talking to your sister. Look who's talking about manners. I butt in whenever I want, you won't tell me when I can or I can't talk with my family. Hear them now, the two who know their place, who stay out of things. Shall we go, Silvia? That's perfect. Some fucking friends I have. Go now! Bye! - Don't yell at me! - Nobody yelled at you! Come on, let's go. Yes, get the fuck off. Nice friends you got! Why don't you go too, Marta? Go to your little dog, poor thing. What's wrong with you, you cunt? What's wrong? Why do you get so aggressive? You asshole! Let's continue, girls. What do we do? It's my birthday, don't you get it? What? Whose birthday is it? Whose house? No, it's not your birthday, you know? I will not play along. You're lonely as fuck. Cut it out! Let me work! Why don't you adopt? Just like you adopted your dog. Adopt a couple of kids, I don't know. What about you, asshole? Fucking psycho! Locked up in there! You cunt! And now the show includes extra drama! Who's the one that's locked up, you idiot? What happened to that inner peace of yours? You fucking thankless cunt! Then why did you come? To put up this show? She thinks you're all here to see her, so she needs to put on some act. Come tell me to my face! Asshole! Come tell me to my face! You stink of fucking Elixir. You smell like shit. The smell coming from your body, from your soul! You motherfucker! I'm sick of you. You smell like a dog. But there's no one to smell it. I'm the one who knows how things really are. Okay, now go lie down. Girls, I'm not interested in keeping this arrangement anymore. Come on, let me out now. It's over. Antonia, come on, open up. Antonia's right, Marga. It's over. Who's speaking? Patti. No, Patti, you stay out. You're not family. Please be quiet. Antonia. Open up. Antonia? Are you there? This is over. I say it's over. Axel, listen to me. What I'll tell you is true. If you don't open, I won't say a word. Then you'll realize when it's true and when it's not. Did you hear that? Do you get it? Mom, I'm coming. Mom? Mom? Mom? What are you doing here? I couldn't find the key. Come lie here for a while. How are you? Now you'll stay here with me. Until Antonia comes. I am very beautiful, as beautiful as my sister…
