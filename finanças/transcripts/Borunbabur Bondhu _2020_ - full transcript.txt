Hey, Biley! Biley? Where did you go? -What did I tell you? -What’s the matter? Why're you bellowing like a bull? He is coming. Told you he would. You paid no heed to me. Who's coming, Sukumar Uncle? I'll tell you… Be patient. For now, get two cups of tea. Yes, certainly. Make two cups of tea. Who's coming? When? Why? What did I tell you? Punu has not forgotten you. He can't. I see. -So, the function was today? -Yes. Hence, this royal attire! But who's coming? You seem so excited! Let’s just say... Borun Babu’s friend. ADAPTED FROM RAMAPADA CHOWDHURY'S 'CHHAD' BORUN BABUR FRIEND -Yes? -I'm from Bakyalap magazine. Sudhir sent these. Okay, okay. Please accept our best wishes on your 80th birthday, sir. Oh! And this is our special edition. This has your article as well. That’s fine, okay. -Sudhir shouldn't have bothered. -It's no big deal. How can we forget your birthday? -I'll take your leave then. -You just can't go like that. -At least have some tea… -No, no. -Swapna… -Yes. -Please make us some tea. -Don't bother. -Just come on in. -Okay. -Who’s come so early in the morning? -It’s Grandpa’s birthday today so… Someone gave him some flowers. And a present. Didn’t I ask you to get some meat? I’ll bring it. But don’t go over the top. My old man doesn't like it. It doesn’t look good if we don’t cook something special. Get the leg piece. I'll go pay my respects... Come along. Just hang on. "Cha" is tea. -Go and give the tea. -"Cha tea!" What did Grandpa call Dad when he was young? -Don’t be cheeky. -Tell me please. Grandpa said your dad's name should have been Useless. What does that mean? Have you called your dad? it's his birthday. There's no point. The landline keeps ringing, he can hardly hear. He's too obstinate to use a mobile. We'll visit him this evening anyway. How old is he turning today? -Born in 1938...so 80. -Eighty, my God! -You should’ve done something special. -Like what? Throw a party? Give me some tea. Yes. The old man is against any fuss on his birthdays. What can we give him? He's got a lot of clothes already... I'll see to it. It's Grandpa's birthday. Hope you remember. I can’t make it. Night shift. At least call him once. Here. If I call, he'll find faults with my Bengali. And a stream of lectures will follow! You’ll do well to listen to him. He's good in both Bengali and English. Coming from Gurgaon is no big deal, Dad. But you are so staid... You don’t want to celebrate. Here, speak to your son-in-law. -Why? -Take it. -Rai! -Yeah! Happy birthday, sir! Many happy returns of the day. -Take care. -What? Your granddaughter is here. Cynical old man! What do you mean? Hello! Hi Grandpa! Happy birthday! Stay blessed, okay? And have a blast. Not a bomb blast! You're too funny! -Mom wants to speak to you. -Yes, give it here. -Like father like daughter. -Keep quiet. What are your plans today? Huh? -Moushumi must be cooking lots of food. -Mutton? Is your sister coming? -Brother? -Everyone will be there. -And your best friend? -Pele! Yes. How is Mom? I’ll take your leave today, sis. You could’ve come in the evening. I can't cope with the crowd in the trains on the way back. I’ll meet Brother-in-Law on my way out. Keep this picture of Lord Rama under your pillow. I’m off. Ah, here is my grandson. Wait… -Here we go. -Chocolates give you cavities. One chocolate will do no harm. Pop one in and the cavities will be turned out! See you. Grandma, I found these flowers in the verandah. You can wish Grandpa with these. -I’m making a card for Grandpa. -Good. Remind your mother to send some dessert to the Kali temple. -Arati. -Yes, ma'am. Tell Moushumi to take out the holy flowers from the dessert. Okay. He doesn’t like rituals. What should I do with the prawns? Clean and marinate them with salt and turmeric. -Then I'll see to it. -Master chef in action. Today's my brother's birthday. -That's right. -Yes. Today is the birthday of another great man. So he is in good company. But you know what? What's the point of celebrating a birthday? His days are numbered. Don’t talk rubbish. As long as he's around, this is the least I can do. I can’t go. Make up some excuse. (TV playing) What are you scribbling? -A letter. -To whom? -We're too old for love letters. -A letter to the editor. A pro-government economist has written a dicey article! I'm penning an apt reply. You've aged yet politics still haunts you. Sukumar, as long as you live, politics will influence your life. You're always complaining politics ruined your football career. The more you think about it, the more it hurts. Wow! You’ve almost completed the crossword! I complete it most days but not today. Satyajit Ray had come up with a strange name for crosswords. -Wordspook! -Dare I say? There are two left. Twenty two up and down and twenty eight across. Why don't you try? Me? An English crossword! Why don’t you just send me home? Why will you go home now? Wait! They’ve cooked meat, Pilaf... If you don’t eat I'll get indigestion. Stay put. How much are the lilies? -Fifty rupees a piece. -Goodness me! This is not the wedding season. Lilies are always a bit expensive. These days it's cheaper to buy cauliflowers instead. How much are the roses and carnations? They are twenty rupees a piece. They are really fresh. Even these are so expensive. Those chrysanthemums will fit your budget. Yes, that’s right. -Give me a dozen chrysanthemums. -Yellow or white? Give me a mix of the two. Put some of those and decorate them. I get it. Make it look big. Right? He just won’t answer the phone. What else have you got for dad apart from flowers? That pen set you were gifted. You hardly ever use it. -Dad writes a lot. -Just a pen set? won't it look bad? Why didn’t you give him that shawl we got from Kashmir last year? I’ve never worn it. Are you mad? Do you know how much it costs? It’s a pure Kashmiri shawl. You took the effort to cook some prawns. That's more than enough. (TV playing) I can’t remember when my other brother died. The only sibling I have now is my eldest brother. Couple of years back you wouldn't have allowed me to do a thing. Now I've become kind of decrepit. I feel like cooking different kinds of dishes. (TV playing) I tried explaining to Moushumi... ...how to make Rohu fish with poppy seeds. Couldn’t make it. Who knows how the mutton will turn out! -It will be fine, don’t worry. -Ma'am, come on. -Happy birthday, Dad. This is for you. -Oh! I don't believe in these customs. However, you ought to remember there's another senior present... Oh yes, I’m so sorry. No, no… I’m not old like him. I am still young. -That is… -Wait… Yes come on. I can never decide what to gift you. You write a lot, so this is for you. As they say, the pen is stronger than sword. -It is mightier than the sword. -Oh. I don’t think that saying is relevant today. How will I describe your creations? How will I disperse your compassion? Will I win over their hearts and soul With the sweetness of your love? What should I sing... She is singing already. -Quiet. -Auntie is singing. So why is she asking what to sing ? ...today in this abode of joy Chanting your name The moon and the stars rush To the boundless oblivion From the sun... -Ma'am. -Softly! ...the stream of love flows From planet to planet The vast sky, the blue lotuses Always radiant in your rays Floating endlessly in your ocean of love What should I sing? How can I extol your virtues? Today in this abode of joy Bravo, bravo! You sing so well. Don't give up singing. Just what happened to me… Trying to manage the household. Why don't you participate in talent shows on TV? Commuting daily to Serampore leaves no time for singing. I get offers for shows but I can’t accept them. -How are you getting on in office? -Just like any other civil servant. The government won't raise our DA. If you ask for it, you're told off. Do you know the catchphrase of the pay commission? "Paying less is our mission!" What about your transfer? That promotion has been stuck. I'd be glad to get away from here. What is the doctor saying about Mom? Not too good. It’ll just go on like this. Money is draining out. A nurse for seven days. Smoking is injurious to health. -Don't interfere when adults talk. -Call me when you do kid's talk. You were saying... Mom has her expenses but Dad too. Medicines and so many tests... He hadn't registered with the central health scheme. Lack of foresight. -Weren’t you going to meet an MP? -I did but Dad has to lobby as well. -He refuses to take any favours. -What favour? It’s his right. He's so obstinate. His savings are feeling the strain. It’ll affect ours as well. I’ve been meaning to say this for long... You earn more so increase your contribution. I give less but I'm here with them all day. I don’t disagree... But try to understand. I have a lot of mortgages. Right now it’s not possible for me. And then there is my son. His medicines and doctor’s fees... -Mine is not a double income family. -Why are you saying the same thing? I know that. But you are living in a prime location. It's for free. Do you know my establishment cost? When this house is promoted you’ll get a share. Why are you saying this now? What has the present got to do with it? -Some more meat? -No more, thanks. -Sidhu, have some more. -I don't have red meat. -Doctor's orders. -Strict orders. The meat needed to be sauteed more. Reema and Bultu didn't come? Pass me the sauce. -They have an interview tomorrow. -For what? For Tuklu’s school admission. These days parents are more tensed. You’re right. And Paula has gone to Shantiniketan. To arrange some exhibition. -Sukumar uncle, take some more meat. -Oh no… -One more prawn please. -Sure. (indistinct chatter) Excuse me... -What happened? Are you feeling unwell? I'm fine. You needn't worry and fight over our medical expenses. I can manage on my own. What was that? What happens to him sometimes? -On a day like this… -He's getting crankier by the day. Let me go and check on him. God knows what's with him. I haven’t married. I live alone. No one to look after me. But you're lucky. You have children. They've come to celebrate your birthday. Suddenly you behaved like that... I know people whose children live abroad. Maybe visit them once a year. A lot of them are in old age homes. I don’t need any sympathy! I don’t expect anything from my children. I don’t believe one's children are old-age insurance. Okay, you don't. Just think at your age... At least one son stays with you. Is that not an advantage? -The advantage is more his. -Come on. Considering Param's income... I don’t think he can ever leave my house. All you do is complain. It’s not a complaint. Harsh reality. I refuse to bury my head in sand like an ostrich. Okay, don’t. I’d better leave. Birthday! This concept is quite strange! What's the celebration for? Am I Gandhi or Netaji? Why? You're Swami Vivekananda! -You are incorrigible… -See you. Grandpa? Welcome, captain Nemo. I've drawn a card for you. Let me see. Wow! It's brilliant. Very good. But how did you know I share my birthday with Swami Vivekananda? Grandma told me. I also know what your school friends called you. Really? What did they call me? Biley. Grandpa, what's the meaning of schmuck? Where did you hear that word? Dad used it. -To whom? -He was telling mom. He was calling your mom that? He told mum Uncle was a real schmuck! Okay, go to bed. Ten rupees, right? (song playing) -Dulal, give me a tooth paste. -Yes. This cacophony to worship the Goddess of music! Really, sir. Ear-rattling! -Doesn’t anyone protest? -Who'd dare? (song playing) Excuse me. -I’ve lived here for fifty years. -We know you, Uncle. -What's the problem? -You are the problem. My wife has bedridden for a year. Who allowed you to play songs this loud? Bachcha did, our councilor. -Why don't you call and request him? -Why should I call anyone? Who's he? If I need to, I'll call the police. -He just threatened us with the police! -Who cares? Let's carry on. (song playing) -I am a cool dude. -What is that? I’ve had eleven "kools" or plums. Great fun, right? Saraswati festival, no studies… How can I study? I’ve offered all my books to the Goddess. Even we followed this rule devoutly. -Go from here. Why did you call the police ? You could have told me. I would’ve spoken to the councilor. Don’t advise me. I have done what is right. -Speaking to you is a problem. -Then don’t. There is a patient at home and those cheap songs are blasting away. You have come to show off your clout? Leave that grovelling for your office. One has to endure a lot to survive. You’ve built up an idealistic image. ...and living off that. Those never benefited us. Rather harmed us. Then don’t introduce me as your dad. I'm okay with that. -It is impossible to talk to you. -You're mistaken. You're not lacking in words, you lack a spine. -Arko. -Yeah. Please, it's high time you did something. How long will you be hopping from one newspaper to the other? Not for long, babe. See, I’m done with print. I’m shifting to electronic media. I’m off. -Checking out Delhi. -Wow ! That means we’re going to see your mug on TV every day? You’ll be famous, dude. Well Neha, I’m actually quite telegenic. Yeah, yeah. So? What about the future? I just told you, Neha. -Arko. -Neha. Our future. What about me? I mean... -Is there any plan at all? -Yeah, there is. Arko, I’ll be here. You’ll be in Delhi. Yeah, so you shift as well. You also come to Delhi. Come on, Neha! What’s the point of staying here? -Calcutta is dying. -Boss, you know my scene. In a typical Gujarati family the only way you get to shift is when you get married. At least my dad is not fussy about me going around with a Bengali but this is... So let’s get married. When? It’ll happen when it happens, darling. Arko, in a business family a marriage is a deal. -Deal? -Yes. The balance sheet you know, right? It has to tally. It’s about who’s worth what. -So I am worthless. -To my dad? Yes. I mean… A struggling young journalist trying to make it big is not the ideal profile for my prospective groom. Listen, first you get a stable job at a reputed media house, okay? Then you come and negotiate. I’ll get the cheque. Excuse me. No I’ll get the cheque. I'm not that worthless, you know? -Another joint? -What else can I do? I was brought up in a joint family. Sagnik, that's not even a PJ. It was pathetic. When are you going to get serious? Why? I am quite serious. I paint, roll my joints and also love you seriously. You call this love? Paula, how would one translate it in English ? Crudely translated it comes to making love. Very convenient for you. No strings attached. -How long will this go on? -Until I become rich and famous. Then we're done for. Someday, I’ll earn twice as much as your husband. My paintings will be worth millions. I'll hold exhibitions... Paris, London, New York… World tours. It’ll all come together. Yes, tell me. I thought you had OT today. Want some? I've come to buy a gift for my maternal uncle. We missed his birthday so Mom was very angry. So I'm getting a gift. Yeah. I am almost done. I’ll pick you up. "To the Editor. I'd like to draw your attention to the recent article by Swarup Sanyal. He's defended the government's refusal to give DA to their employees ...and concluded that the last government covertly favoured the middle class. This one supports the poor. I'm tempted to use some trite subalter..." -Subaltern. -Yes, that’s it. "...subaltern examples of freedom of expression but I refrain. You're an intellectual and the head of Pay Commission. You are an expert on Economics. And your degrees are genuine." There's the writer. Oh my, can't read anymore ... -He’ll start cribbing. -He hates propaganda. Tell me about it. He is something! He could've gone places if he wanted to. -Some serious discussion? -Just discussing discussions. Pranabesh Chattopadhyay has been nominated the 13th president of India. His election had an air of certainty in the political world. From the CM to the PM, everyone has congratulated him. The people of Bengal are overjoyed to have their first Bengali President. Let us hear what they have to say. Why so happy? Have you seen the news? Read the morning papers? That's all the TV channels have been showing. Oh! Mr. Cactus, you don't need water. That's your reaction? Why? Not equal and opposite? You are... -...something else. -Why? -Am I supposed to dance in joy? -I didn’t say that. You have a contribution to this. Doesn't that excite you? What contribution? It hardly matters. Look Borun, you’ve attained salvation. But I'm a plebeian. Just a common man. I can't remain indifferent. Our school friend... India’s next president. How can I not be excited? Can you imagine? It was always on the cards. Now the formal announcement has been made. What's with the fuss? You call this fuss? Are you going to have some tea? -Of course! -Get one more cup of tea. I knew Pranabesh Chattopadhyay went to school with you. Not just that. He was Borun's satellite. -Stop that. -Shut up. In fact, Borun introduced Punu to politics. Oh! It’s best not to talk about that. Explaining Hegel, Marx, Engels, Immanuel Kant to him used to exhaust me. Nothing worked. I’m delighted. Here take this. -Don’t give him any. -I’ll be right back. Now go around gloating. Dad’s friend is the President. What rubbish? -He must be secretly pleased. -Forget it. They were classmates, that’s all. -Sukumar Uncle was saying that... -That's another one... A complete bullsh**ter! He loses the plot, making up stories. Couldn't play for the best football clubs since he worked in the railways. Was apparently left out of the Asian Games due to politics! Load of rubbish! -Don't insult without knowing the truth. -Hah! Miss Know All! You know more about my father than me! He is quite a difficult bloke. Picking fights with everyone. Some letter he wrote... -I'm getting f**ked in office! -This is your dad you're talking about... My uncle was the party block president. But he never took any favours. Over a difference of opinion, he stopped going. Everyone in the party respected him so much. Respect and ideals... Give me that. ...put all that in the bank! Then gradually use them as required. If only he had kept in touch with Pranabesh Chatterjee. But no. They differed politically. Hello ! Borun Babu? Yes, speaking. All good sir? Yes, fine. I'm not sure who you are. Tarun from the publishers. Oh, yes. I am well, and you? Me too, sir. Your cheque is ready. What cheque? Your royalty, sir. Oh dear! People still read essays, do they? Of course, sir! Do you remember Sushil? Sushil? Sushil Sarkar the poet. An intellectual who appears on TV regularly. His allegiance swings with whoever is in power. That's true for many... Anyway, what of him? Nothing, sir. He took your number from me. Wants to get in touch. With me? Strange! -Is Borun Babu there? -Yes. -He's always home. - I got caught up in a rally. I was there too. -Tea? Dad's in here. -Yes. See everyone is entitled to his political views... whatever may be the compulsion. You have yours but I'm not bound to follow them. You are misunderstanding me, sir. You are an asset to society. I read your piece in the newspaper. Your analysis was remarkable! Your writing prowess is truly admirable. If we could get you on our side, we would be enriched. Our work would also be properly evaluated. I am here under instructions from the upper echelons. Have you read that poem by Shankha Ghosh? Someone is searching for something in vain in a dark room. -Later we find out that the person... -Has lost his spine. Exactly! Borun Babu... What I have to say is simple. The government has nominated you for an award. The money is good and tax free. You and your wife's treatment must be expensive. -If the government takes charge... -Sushil. I’ve been listening to you and getting irked. But now you are crossing your limit. If you don’t want an unpleasant situation, please leave my house this instant. And don't ever come with such proposals again. You can do whatever you want, Dad. But don't embarrass us. Your actions may also embarrass me. You don’t work anymore so... But I have to survive. I'm not as valiant... I am not valiant. But not a coward either. Think of circling the world and taking Mom away, far away. What are you talking about? -You're the one who called Grandpa valiant. -You fool! It's all my fault. I didn’t bring up my sons properly. You were always busy. Don’t talk and stress yourself. As it is I'm a burden! On top of it... this unpleasantness. I'm bedridden... But I can still see. I am the root of all problems. What rubbish! I'm ailing... The cost of my treatment is weighing you down. -Others are insulting you. -Listen to me. I could keep my head high all my life because you stood by me. Why are you stressing about such things? You'll fall sick. Don’t worry. It's okay. See what you can do. -You can come here straight. -She was such a kind soul... Okay, see you. We'll have to move now. Control her a bit. Dad, we have to go now. Yes. You don't have to come along. We were together for so many years. Let me stay with her a bit longer. Who'll come in the hearse? -I will. -What? -You come with me in my car. -It's okay. -The doctor’s certificate... -I have it all with me. (indistinct chatter) Grandpa... I’ve drawn a picture of Grandma. I’ll frame it for you. Grandpa... Why did Grandma die? It was time for her to go. No. They don’t stay in this world anymore. That’s all. You don’t know. Good people go to heaven. And the bad people... -Who told you this? -Swapna Auntie. And she was saying that Grandma will go to heaven. Is heaven a star? Nemo, don’t bother Grandpa. Come here. Grandpa, won’t you feel lonely? Should I stay? Transcending the boundaries of life and death Oh friend of mine, you stand beside me Transcending the boundaries of life and death Upon the deserted horizon of my love Your place in my heart is blazing alight Upon the deserted horizon of my love Your place in my heart is blazing alight Immersed deep in hope of eternal bliss I raise my arms in awe and gaze at you Transcending the boundaries of life and death The silent night under your feet Darkness, she sprawls like your unfettered hair The silent night under your feet Darkness, she sprawls like your unfettered hair Amazing is your song that cascades Through your lute down to the earth Its harmony brings the world together as one. I lose myself within the melancholy of your song Excuse me. -Brother? -It's okay, you stay here. I love this song. Which film is it from? -Wasn’t Rakhee the actress? -No... -Then who? Subho... -Right! Transcending the boundaries of life and death Dad. Oh friend of mine, you stand beside me Transcending the boundaries of life and death (indistinct chatter) Now Rai will speak about her grandma. Sit. Good afternoon... It's difficult to talk about Grandma. Whenever Calcutta is mentioned... She can't speak Bengali fluently. That's what I get reminded of. My grandma. She doesn't live here. When I was small... Like very little... I remember Grandma used to offer me these little pieces of betel leaf. I still keep thinking about that. A mish-mash of Bengali and English... Thank God Dad was in the other room. She has really grown up. And she looked so pretty. You were also looking pretty. There was an assistant director in our neighbourhood. He offered me a role in a movie. Really? Why didn’t you do it? I'm terrible at remembering dialogues. Messed up in a neighbourhood play. Actually he was just hitting on me. I don't blame him. What are you doing? Are you doing the crossword? "Graave-yard." What does "graaveyard" mean? Not graaveyard, graveyard. People of some religions bury their dead here. To bury means... Put that down. A burial means they are laid down under the ground and... ...over time they become part of the soil. No. Why didn’t they keep Grandma there? Actually, Hindus follow different rituals. I was born into a Hindu family alright. But now I'm nothing. And me? You'll decide when you grow up. Are there ghosts in the graveyard? Let's go there and check. Who stays under the ground there? The Christians, the Muslims... Derozio, Michael... Nothing much. Could be cataract. I have to get it checked. Dr. Chakraborty has passed away, right? Yes, about a year back. You could speak to Abhijit... Paula’s husband. How are you? He's in the bathroom. I often think of visiting you... Abhijit's so busy. Hold on... Its Uncle. Uncle... I am so embarrassed. Couldn't come for the memorial service... I had an emergency case. Very sorry. It's okay. Your profession keeps you busy. My eyes are giving me trouble. Just a little problem in reading... I have a friend who's an ophthalmologist. But his chamber is quite far. You can go to Subir Dutta Eye Foundation. But what is his grudge against you? My promotion has been on the line for two years. Same with the Mumbai transfer. I can’t do anything about it. He’s too close to the management. Let me find some connections. Please do! I used to know someone. Gaurav Mathur. But he has given up his job and gone off on a spiritual trip. How is Raka? Commuting to Serampore is taking its toll. Oh fish! Daily to Serampore? My goodness! I am the one forcing her to keep the job. Otherwise she'll eat my head. She'll be here soon. -Shall I repeat the drinks? -Go ahead. -Isn’t Rai coming back today? -No. -She has a sleepover at her friend's. -That means drinking and all. I don’t think so. Her parents are there. Let her be. She’s going out after so long... Having fun... After her visa got rejected she was so depressed. It seemed like the world had come to an end. When is she applying again? Don't know yet. These are actually nothing. If you have the right contacts, it's just a cake walk. What's up with your delegation to Davos? The final list is not out yet. If I could make it, it would've been a major boost for me. Right. See, if you could get hold of someone... I will also go with you. There is one more, sir. Yes, what were you saying? But you know, I’m just taking some time to decide. You are from a good cultured family. -This freelance means you work for free. -Freelance doesn’t mean free... -You need a steady income. -Yes, sir. There is nothing here, apart from trading. Look son, I am not that conservative. I have accepted that you are friends. But if you want to take it beyond that... Then you’ll have to settle. I mean properly settled. You know Neha is used to a certain lifestyle. Yes, sir. You can’t make that out now but... Have tea. Pinaki is a good lad. He is very active in our alumni association Oh. What can I do for you? Our school's 150th anniversary falls next month. You must've heard that our President will be there. Everything has been possible thanks to Sukumar sir. I've done nothing. One phone call, that’s it. He heard my name and took the call. Punu hasn’t forgotten me. We want you to attend the function as well. They want you to facilitate Punu. Facilitate? It’s all the same. They want you to do that. I’ve heard he's an old friend of yours. As far as I know his induction to politics was through you. Our school alumni association has held a lot of functions earlier. You’ve never invited me or even informed me. Now I'm not keeping well... I haven't recovered since my wife's demise... You’ll have to excuse me. If I’m not mistaken, I last met him in '98. Since then, neither of us has had a problem in our lives. Even if we don’t meet in the future, it won’t make any difference. I won’t force you further. I’ll take your leave today. Can I sit here awhile? You're really obstinate. Let it be. I thought it would be nice if you felicitated him personally. But you don’t want that. That I understand. Don't dwell on the past. Besides you can’t be certain Punu didn't try to help... Always obdurate! As a child takes repose On his mother's Elysian lap Even so, here in the Long Home..." Hey? Nemo. Nemo? Come this way. Fatty, run fast. Quickly. Hey, wait for me. Wait! Why aren’t you waiting for me? Punu! You? (indistinct) -What’s this? -Come on. Hey! Punu, look where they are taking me. Punu! Punu...see...what they’re doing... I told you, my father's stubborn. Dad must’ve a reason for not going. Plain jealousy. Dad never achieved anything... His pictures would be in the papers if he had gone... My image in office would get a boost. Say that. You're bitter because you couldn't cash in on this. Don’t talk rubbish. -You could've flaunted it as well. -Take your water bottle... -Always talking rubbish. -Come, come. All his life he’s been an idealist. That's the problem. He couldn’t achieve anything. Now he’s frustrated. His school didn’t felicitate him, so he didn’t go. After all, he is the president of the country. Can dad compare with him? Who’ll explain that to him? During the Emergency in the seventies... there was an incident. Pranabesh Uncle's role in it... Or rather, the lack of it... Dad could not forget. What did I tell you? I see. -So, the function was today? -Yes. Hence, this royal attire! Let’s just say... Borun Babu’s friend. -The president? -Yes. -Where? To our house? -What else? Punu has sent you a letter as well. -Is he really coming? -Yes. I can’t believe it! My reading glasses are giving me trouble. Oh my God. "Dear Biley. I thought I’d see you today. But it did not happen. Sukumar gave me the news about Lolita. I felt very sad. My heartfelt condolences. -Your health, I hear, is not eating well." -Keeping well. "I have to come to Kolkata often. Since you won’t come... I hope you won’t mind. Yours, Punu." Oh dear, what terrible handwriting! He would’ve made a good doctor. -Mom. -Yes. Are you sure? Moushumi has seen the letter. Ask her to read it out. -Don't be stupid! -Why? -The letter must not be with her. -That's true. -It'll be incredible if it's true. -Wait. Don’t get so excited. Let him visit first. Let’s keep our fingers crossed. -Rai, come here. -Yes. Big people often make big promises. Don’t go around telling people until he really does visit. -Specially your notary club members. -Why should I? Simple, to show off. Grandpa must be a really important person, right? Otherwise, why would the President write a letter to him? Rai, it's not a matter of importance. When people become big and successful sometimes they revisit their past. Why? -It gives them some kind of pleasure. -What pleasure? That we went to school together... See where you are and where I am today. It was a short letter. Why should a personal letter be on a letter head? I can’t quite remember... Yes... That bulls**tter Sukumar could have written it. -What! -That Sukumar. He’s a big liar. Unlikely... -Sugar? -No. You should take up writing. You’ll make a name for yourself. Brother, why don't you ask Dad? I might as well see him now. Ok. I’ll be right back. Here sir, what's up? He never visits us. A whiff of an opportunity and he's here. -Are you having difficulty with your eyes? -Probably cataract... Let’s show an eye specialist. -Let me find out. -No. I’ve spoken to Abhijit. I'll go to his recommended doctor. Will Abhijit have the time? He's involved in some case. What case? One of his patients died. The nursing home got smashed up. The patient’s family lodged a case. Civil court, consumer forum, medical council... Doctors and teachers were once considered noble professions. Now they're highly commercialised. That’s it. How come you are suddenly here? Didn't you have office? Yes, I did. I had some work this side. Thought I'd see you. After Mom passed away, I've hardly visited. -Don’t bother. -Right. I wanted to know something. If you want to confirm whether the President is coming or not... I can't assure you. He has sent a letter. The handwriting seems to be his. It’s in the drawer. I can show you. No, it's okay. Your medicines must cost you a lot. That's true. A good part of my pension goes towards it. Plus doctor’s fee...tests... Any progress with your medical health scheme? No. I forgot to submit some documents. I never got around to it. Param contacted some MP but... -I can’t go with folded hands to anyone. -You're stubborn about everything. Why can't you just meet the MP once? Forget it. Don't need medical benefits at my age. Okay, you don’t have to do anything. -I’ll speak to Punu about this. -Absolutely not. You don’t have to do anything. I don’t want any favours from him. The older he becomes the more obstinate he gets. I told you not to tell people. You concentrate on this. They're busy people, can't take their word for it. I didn't tell anyone. Just your brother and sister like you asked. And my mother. No one else. Thank God! Just my bad luck. Nothing good matures. Everything fizzles out. Write this properly. What's up? Your brother-in-law had already warned. VIPs say a lot of things... Then they forget. The way Moushumi put it, I was excited when I told my husband. What a loss of face. Thank God I never told anybody else. It would be even more embarrassing. No, Dad is at fault as well. The President is showing an interest... Dad should've followed it up. I'm sure he didn't. Yes. Yes listen... I am hanging up. We are going out. Okay, call me later. Listen... -President is spelt with 'S', not 'C'. -Okay. Grandpa, who is a president? President is our country’s number one man. Where does he stay? In a huge mansion in Delhi! What does he do? Oh dear! -This is a difficult question. -He doesn’t do anything? Then why isn’t he coming to see you? He will come. Let's see... Dad said he isn't coming because you didn't go to "felicate" him. What does "felicate" mean? Felicitate. Here you go. I can’t wait any longer. Don’t behave like this, Borun. I'm sure he'll keep his word. I’ve been hearing that for long. Maybe he's at work. -I could also have some work. -What work do you have now? You normally don’t go out at this time. Why today? That's him! Yes, he's here, hold on. Here. Always in a hurry! Hello. I’m fine. How are you? What's the need for all this? You've such a busy schedule. Even at this age your memory is sharp. Of course! I hope there are no restrictions on your diet. At one time you could eat more than any of us! The President is going to Kolkata to inaugurate a museum. So? He will deliver a memorial lecture on 12th January, Vivekananda's birthday. You want to go to listen to it? He remembers Uncle's birthday is on 12th January. Oh, great! Pranabesh Chatterjee is coming to our house to meet Brother that day! -I'm so happy! -Are you serious? -You? -How are you? -You've come after so long. -I just don’t get the time. -Is your dad back? -Yes. You know Dad. Don’t go over the top. Besides, Mom passed away less than a year ago. Yes, technically we're still in mourning. Dad has no issues with that. Problem lies elsewhere... With Dad, everything is an issue. This birthday we can do something different. We've never celebrated his birthday... If we do now, won't it be odd? What's odd about it? If the President comes, there has to be something special. -I don’t think that should be an issue. -Yes exactly. I am thinking of coming a couple of days early. Arun will come on the 12th itself. Don’t call too many people. It'll be chaotic. (singing) Taking selfies? You are already the selfie queen. (singing) There we go, Nidhiram Sardar. I have the shield. The sword is there too. My goodness! Expensive whiskey at your brother's must've gone to your head. -No, no. -You must've drunk a lot. He is a bloody miser. He’s hidden all the single malts. However, we’ve come up with a good plan. Here, why do you listen in on our conversation? Go to Grandpa’s room. You're interested in whiskey, I in your conversation. The birthday will be a big affair. Very selective people will be invited. -I'll call Dad, Mom and Tumpa for sure. -Okay. Wonder how the big shots in office will react! They can’t put me down again. This is my chance. My Dad’s friend is the President... It’s not a trifling matter. Dad, Sam was just telling me that... if the President recommends my case getting my visa will not be a problem. Rubbish, no recommendation is required. -One phone call will be enough. -Exactly. You could also talk to him about your delegation.. After Kolkata he'll come here for the IITF summit. He's the chief guest. I just have to address him as Uncle there. Then I’ll see who can exclude me! Can’t we request him to be an honorary member in our Notary Club? Are you mad? The President a member of your Notary Club! Don’t do anything of the sort. Let my trip come through... you'll go up in status. -Who can block your promotion now? -Softly. Even walls have ears. I don’t want much. Just arrange a transfer to Kolkata, that'll do. Everyone is on their own trip, see? He is the Indian President. For him that is nothing. Think big! Ask for a big boon. The genie only appears once. This is like really exciting, man. My dad could not believe it. He was my Grandpa’s nappy buddy. You belong to such a prestigious family, Arka. I mean, the Indian President is such a close friend of your Grandpa's. Incidentally... You are talking about the Indian President. Do you even know his name? -Uh oh! -Come on. Why shouldn’t I know? -Who is it? You know... That Muslim chap! You know. What’s his name? Go on, say it. -Some Alam or something. -Oh my God. You mean Kalam. -Yeah, right! That’s history, baby. Why is Sister coming now? Souvik's cousin is getting married. That's why. Did you know they were coming? Or was it planned suddenly? It wasn’t certain whether Souvik would get leave... So it was a bit of last minute planning. They would never have come at this time. The President's coming, so they’re turning up. The things you say! Her tongue's hanging out at the thought of meeting the president. She will definitely tell him this... When you visit the States you must come to dinner at my house. You really talk rubbish. I'm not sure about Souvik's agenda, though. Don’t you have any agenda? What agenda can I have, Mom? Just that court case of Abhijit's... If something could be arranged... He so does not deserve it, Mom. -Who’s that? -A colleague. Yes, tell me. I had something to tell you, Paula. But I don’t know how to put it. Why are you beating around the bush? Without blabbering, come to the point. I kind of need a favour from you. That’s obvious. What is it? It’s about my painting academy scholarship. You know it’s a central government scheme. There is a lot of politics involved there. Without a recommendation it’s difficult. My fiscal state is currently very bad. If I don’t get the scholarship this time... I don’t know. If you talk to your uncle’s friend... You don’t know my Uncle. I'll tell him but I can’t promise. Tuklu, stop being so naughty. Be a good boy and eat up. Come here. Where are you going? -Tuklu. -I’ve caught you. -Bring me my lunch. -I’ll bring it right away. Mom, your son was saying... ...why don't we ask Uncle to arrange for Tuklu's admission to a big school? The other day I got him to memorise the five times table. At the interview, he couldn’t say a thing. He just sat there. He coloured all the flowers brown. Actually Reema, my brother has never asked anyone for a favour. I won't be able to ask Brother. No one bothered to remember his birthday before. Have this and see how it is. I have put coriander leaves in it. Grandpa... I was thinking of asking you something. What? Salary? No, madam increased that after the festive season. Oh, then... You want leave? -No sir, it’s not that. The president is coming to your house. Please ask him to arrange for an auto rickshaw for my husband. What? -Auto? -Yes. He's applied for a license, but the party in power is not allocating... Swapna... The president has umpteen responsibilities. -He can’t get your husband an auto license. -If you ask him, he will do it. He is your friend. Please look into it. Hello. Grandpa, this is Arka. Arka? Your grandson Arka. Oh, yes. What is it? Will you be home tomorrow evening? Yes... Why? I want to meet you around eight-ish? Why come to me ? I’ll tell you when I meet you. See you at eight tomorrow. Your sister Bokul Aunty from Bardhaman has come. -Bokul? -Yes. -Suddenly? Why? -I don’t know. Her grandson is with her. They are in the drawing room. Please come. -Oh, Daughter-in-Law. -Swapna, make three cups of tea. Ask your maid to take this gourd. -God bless you, dear. -What was the need for all this? -Where is my grandson? -He has gone to school. Okay... -Did you go to the mart before you came? -No... I grew it in my garden so I got one for you. I’ve brought four coconut sweets as well. I know you like them. Do you remember, Brother? After your graduation, three of you had come to Bardhaman. Pranabesh used to tell such funny stories. Sukumar would climb trees. And you... -You sat all day by the pond fishing. -Yes, I remember all that... But did you have some work in Kolkata? No, I’ve been planning to come since I heard. After my husband passed away, his evil brothers are trying... ...to evict me from my home and property. They have started court proceedings. I can’t read or write. I don’t understand all that. They have got the local club on their side. Wait... Why are you telling me all this? What do you mean? Get your friend to arrange something. He'd stayed in our house... And he can’t do this little bit? This is my grandson, he's on the wait list of the entrance examination. Why don't you ask the President... Nowadays there's some other quota... -Tell him... -Minority quota. All this quota rubbish fill up half the seats. How will he get in? Why don't you get him into a good engineering college? Bokul, it'll not be possible for me to ask for all this. -I have never asked anyone for such... -What kind of talk is that? In times of need, one seeks help from near and dear ones... Arka said that the Indian President is not only our bosom friend... -He also takes your advice... -Not at all. We haven't been in touch for quite sometime. Oh! Well, sir... Your grandson is a very close friend of my daughter. And it’s highly likely they are going to... you know. That is very good news. Inter-community and inter-religious marriages are very healthy. I am very liberal. My son also married someone from a different caste. But sir, I have one request. That day I’ll come and seek the President’s blessings. It’s not often you get to meet a person like that. That day is your birthday as well. I would like to come and wish you. Is it only out of courtesy or... What? Is it only about blessings and wishing? (TV playing) Grandpa. I’ve drawn a picture of your friend. How did you know my friend? Oh! This does look a lot like him. When he comes, give it to him as a gift. What? What celebration? A lot of people will come. They’ll bring you presents... Sorry, they’ll bring gifts. I don’t like this at all. Hordes of people will come with their own personal agendas. Tell Punu to come another day. But he has already spoken to you. I can’t stand all this fuss. Don’t worry, I am there... I’ll manage everything. I won't allow anyone near him. There was some trouble at the college hostel you said... The students are fasting in protest... News channels are not covering it... Neither the newspapers. A distant relative, my grandson is a leader there. He asked for your number. I gave it to him. He'll call. Please answer. -Okay. -I’m off. Sir, sir! One minute, sir. Just a minute. What’s happened? - Last year she won at the state level. -Yes, sir. We are a hard up family... These competitions are expensive. Come and see me sometime. Let me see what I can do. If she gets selected for the Asian Games, she has a chance of winning. It’s not because she’s my daughter... To get her trained by a foreign coach they will even take her abroad. -That is very good news. -It's expensive... The government is giving her a meagre sum. -How much money? -Sir, it’s not about money. I was wondering if you could just tell the President once. If he just tells them the government may fund it all. Greetings, Borun Babu. -The letter we sent to the councilor... -For what? To increase the size of our water ferrule. Increasing water pressure is not under the President’s jurisdiction. Where did the President come into this? I have no objection in going. Though me going there won't help much. I would like to stand by you... After all, this is my Alma Mater. We are living in such a country and in such a society... Where at every point we are being attacked... Yet... I am amazed at how insular we have become. We are tolerating everything. We’ve learnt to endure it all. At a time like this, when youth like you stand to offer resistance... Unlike us, you haven’t rotted and worn away. You fight for your rights and justified demands. Then... It feels like a breath of fresh air. I have come here for that breath of fresh air! I am not an orator. I don’t even have much to say. I had read a poem by a German priest, written during the Nazi regime... I had read the Bengali translation... "First they came for the communists. I did not protest. Then... Then there was no one left To protest on my behalf." Dad. Bachcha has come to talk to you. Who is Bachcha? Don’t you recognise me, Uncle? Your civil servant. This area’s councilor. Back to back, two terms. Shibnath Saha from house number 26. Oh, Shibu. -Astrologer, palmist... -Yes. Suddenly why’ve you decided to serve me? To take care of that is our duty, right? Actually, work pressure restricts my visits. That is my fault. A highly respected person like you living in my constituency... It’s a matter of pride. I’ve told your son already. I’ll be there. My boys will be there. Law and order, we shall manage it all. When the President goes somewhere his own security takes care... ...of his safety and also law and order of that place. I don’t think there’ll be any need for you. Yes. Yes. -I’ll take my leave then. -Okay. When auntie was unwell my boys had played the music a bit too loudly. I am sorry for that. From now instead of calling the police call me. I’ll sort everything out. I’m off. I told you he’s turned cynical. -And he has completely lost it. -No, he is perfectly sound. The lecture he delivered at the college... It was definitely sound. I’ll send it to you. It’s lucky that the President is his friend. Otherwise, he would be under great pressure. You know your grandpa is a righteous man. I don’t think he’ll allow all that. Don’t be unreasonable, Dad. Neha’s dad got me in touch with this national news channel. And guess what? They want me to do an exclusive live for them. It’s going to be a big break for me. Break? If Grandpa finds out, he’ll break your legs. Dad, I’ve given my word to him. Besides, we’ll have a small DSLR set-up. People will think we’re taking stills. President, live on TV. Some protocol has to be followed, isn’t it? How will you do it? You will need to take permission. The president is a childhood friend coming to the house. It’s a very human angle, Siddhartha. Besides, the family could also make a personal video. Come through here. Left. Here through the Verandah. No, Tommy! -Oh dear! Don’t bring him this way. -Why are you shouting? (indistinct chatter) Here, this is dad’s room. -Dad. -I am in the bathroom. Dad’s in the bathroom I think. Oh my god! He is coming again! Where did this thing come from? Where did he come from? Come, Tommy. -Which one should I wear tomorrow? -I like all of these. -I think this is the best. -This? Where's Rai? In Arka’s room. They are listening to music. -What will you wear tomorrow? -I am not sure. I’ve brought a Jamdani and a Kanjeevaram saree. I can’t find a blouse for the Kanjeevaram. I have blouses. Take a look. Your blouse on me. It won’t fit. -See how fat I've become? -Sree! Don’t fish for compliments. I shudder to think what Moushumi will wear. She is an absolute wardrobe disaster. Couple of days back I called up about the menu. All through the discussion she mispronounced "caterer." Hilarious! The harmonium has come down from the cupboard top... I hope you’re singing tomorrow. -We will sing. You and me together. -Me? Have you gone crazy? Do you know how long I haven’t sung? -As if I am performing daily. -Even then! What should I sing? 'Come, come into my house'? Tagore's song? He likes Rajanikanta better. You’re going to sing a Rajanikanta song to the President? Your visit this year was really perfectly timed... Coinciding matched with the President's visit. How exciting! How prestigious! It will cause a stir in our Bengali community. I am just keeping quiet. I’m not telling anyone anything. Just take a selfie and post it. That’s it. You know what happened? Abir Chatterjee, the actor! He was in Houston. He’d gone to my friend’s place for dinner. That friend’s conceit! You won’t believe it. -Really? -Yes, seriously. I've also decided, when the President comes to Houston... ...then he has to come home for dinner as well. I'm sure he'll go. I’ve heard he’s very fond of Bengali food. -Where will he find Bengali cooking abroad? -Exactly! Isn’t that so? Souvik said even if the president doesn't come for dinner... His contacts can be used to get the green card. That will be enough. I will becoming the secretary for sure. Oh, just give me a minute, sorry. Hi, honey, what’s up? Ah, you're going downtown this evening? That’s great. But just remember… No, no. Just pretzels and cereals from Seven Eleven. No burgers. Oh! Peter's coming as well. No, that is not allowed. King can only move one space. Queen can go in any direction, as many spaces as she wants. There's a king and a queen. Aren’t there prince and princess? No. Grandpa, you'd told me you’d take me to Princess Ghat... ...where you and your friends used to go. It’s not "princess" but Princep Ghat. When will you take me there? Let me see... Let tomorrow's ordeal get over. The day after. Yes, day after it may well be. It’s a Sunday. Ask your mom to get you ready early. Grandpa, your friend is coming on your birthday. Aren’t you happy? I am not sure. When you are, let me know. Certainly. -Dad, Dad… -Yes? What? Dad, get up slightly. Take a look. -Here he is... Happy birthday. -Happy birthday. What's all this? -Happy birthday, Dad. -Happy birthday, Grandpa. -Stay blessed. -Our best wishes. Oh dear, in the middle of the night? I saw you reading a book, so I asked them to make a video call. Since you're awake, we thought of wishing you together... -...at exactly midnight. -The first to wish you. Well, I accept your best wishes. And I express my gratitude. -Happy birthday! -Happy birthday! Tomorrow, no sorry today... This evening we’ll see you again. See you ! -Yes, you go to sleep. -Bye, bye. -Go to sleep. -Bye. Good night. He has come… Your friend is here. It is not 'he has come'... it is 'I have come today'. -Not 'your friend' but 'your bride'. -It's all the same. So you’ve decked up and come so early. What else could I do? Have to check whether the decorators are doing their job on time... I won’t get time to change. -Why did you have to dress up like a joker? -I’ve dressed up like a joker? Exactly. The coloured 'dhoti' looks clownish. 'Dhoti' should be white. You are completely backdated. You have no idea about current fashion trends. On such a joyous day how can I not dress up? How can you stay so detached? -Sheer practice. -Practice what? To stay disinterested. You are here? Come quickly, my friends. -They have come! -Who has come? Fifty chairs. -And I am ready. -Okay. Go get dressed. Huh! Detached ! Keep the President and my grandfather in focus... Grandpa, my friend Ken. Oh yes.. This is my grandfather's friend, Sukumar. -Yes, hello. -My goodness! This is... Keep following them… Sit over here... you're the centre of attraction today. -Sit. -You really go over the top. Here they are... Come on in. -Happy birthday. -What was the need for all this? -Happy birthday. -Give it to me. Here come the rest. Happy birthday, Dad. -Dad’s looking great. -God bless. Give him this. He'll love it. Another shawl! Okay. Shawls may come, shawls may go... It’s not that shawl... That's short for 'shalti', a dinghy boat. This is a pure Kashmiri shawl, Dad. Your son bought it for you. What will I do with a shawl? I hardly get an opportunity to wear all this. -So what? Wear them at occasions. -Exactly. Dad. Here they are. Here. Many happy returns of the day, Uncle. Thank you. How are you? Keeping well? (indistinct chatter) Hi... Hi... Here comes my sister-in-law. We can open a flower shop now. Dad! Let me seek your blessings. -How are you? -Fine. Happy birthday, Dad. -Pay your respects. -Happy birthday, Grandpa. That’s his daughter from Delhi... Granddaughter has really grown up. Happy birthday. I think of coming here often but I can't manage with all the work. I tell your daughter though, even if I can’t she should come. But this time around it’s different. It’s a special day! After all it’s your 80th birthday. You have messed up your homework. I was 80 last year. -My mistake, sorry! -Never mind. -See you in a bit, Dad. -Come. (indistinct chatter) Happy Birthday. -I haven’t seen you in a long time. -Yes. I hardly go out nowadays. Brother... People have become anti social. We forget man is a social animal. Here's your NRI niece and her husband. (indistinct chatter) Greetings, greetings. -Who's this? -Haven't seen him before. -Oh, the councilor. -Give me the flowers. He's come because of the President. Happy birthday, Uncle. There’s no need for all this. -His gift. -Pass it. Here’s a small gift from our side. What’s this? Just a few books of verse and music CDs. -By who? -Silly question! Move away... Media is not allowed. Take it easy. Hold up. Go in, I’ll manage. Step back please. TV channels step forward. I'll say whatever has to be said. -Moushumi, let’s go check the food. -Come, let’s. (indistinct chatter) I’ll request our cameraman to pan and show you... This is the house... ...where the President is coming to meet his childhood friend, Borun Chakraborty. This has created a stir in the locality. A huge crowd has gathered. Let us get some reactions. -Let me tell you a joke about drinking... -Cheers! You're drinking whiskey? -He’s far too cheeky. -Have you seen his glasses? Go get some fish fingers. Is it a pillow? No, just drink up. Give him to me. I don’t mind a drink. Don’t pour anymore, it's almost time. Let’s go downstairs. Sing something else before the main song. Something else? What about 'Those were the days'? -It’s a cliché. -I know but it works. -Always appropriate. -Okay, sing that. -Hello. -Here they come. -We are here. -Ah, it’s so humid. You all know this song. Everyone must join in. Okay. Those were the days my friend How can I forget? The passing glances, our tete-a-tetes Those are unforgettable moments What happened, sing? Those were the days my friend How can I forget? The passing glances, our tete-a-tetes Those are unforgettable moments Come once more, my friend, Into my heart again We'll chat about life’s ups and downs And set our world to right -I can’t do anymore... -Why don't you dance, Rai? We used to take up eating challenges in our youth. Yes. Challenges to eat more sweets. -Now Kiki Challenge is the trend. -What's that? Momo challenge. She is going to jump out of the car and dance! Just imagine! -Change is everywhere. -Yes. Change is the only constant. If you can’t accept it you're in trouble. Isn't it time for him to come? We’ll be right back. Biley don’t talk to Punu about all that. No point digging up the past. Are you mad or what? Rubbish. They are all dry essays. Besides, giving your own work doesn’t look nice. You're too complicated... He’s probably arrived. He’s here, hold on. Punu. Yes... Oh, I see. This can always happen. Why should I mind? I understand. We’ll catch up later. The excitement surrounding the President's visit to this locality.... evaporated as we got news that he will not be coming due to an emergency meeting. There is a sense of despondency amongst all. What an anti-climax! We have to hang our heads in shame. Media isn’t reporting it in much detail but he’s stuck in an important meeting. Whatever be the reason. The expectations of so many! So much preparation, all for nougat. It’s a bit embarrassing. He should’ve called him once. He and his ego... No, actually Dad was arrested during the Emergency period. We know all that. He was a minister then... -It's only supposition. -Exactly! It could be though? What does self-respect mean? Everybody is very disappointed. how you all can be so insensitive. A riot is brewing... Lives may be lost. You expect the President to visit his friend under such circumstances? Of course everyone is disappointed. You’ve lived in reflected glory all your life. Suku. That’s alright. The President did not come. No. What work? That's why he didn’t come. Go now, don’t bother me. And doesn’t matter to me who says what. Listen... Come here. Are you angry? Tell your mom to get you ready by ten tomorrow. Tomorrow Princess… Sorry Princep Ghat? Yes? Yes. What did you say? Yes, I’ll tell him right now. The way Borun babu was humiliated last night... -So his lackey is also absent. -Exactly. -Shyamal uncle. -Who’s that? Oh it’s you. What’s the matter? Isn’t Dad with you? No, what's the matter? Just something urgent. He won't even use a cell phone. Check near the park, he goes there sometimes. Hey, did you see that? Don't get too snooty or we'll throw you in. -No, no. -Yes, we'll throw you in! Please don't. It's really scary. -Come on, this way. -Yes. Has Dad returned? No, I've looked everywhere. He is nowhere to be seen. I just saw him near the club. Pass the ball to Biley! (indistinct chatter) Goal! -Looks like a government vehicle. -Yeah. What’s up? Couldn't have come today. There's no security personnel, after all. -Then who? -Whose car is this? Someone's come to see you. They're upstairs. -Nonsense! -He's never this late. -Dad is supposed to take Nemo out. -Today? -Grandpa is here. -What? Dad, Grandpa is here. -Where were you? -Yeah, tell us. The boys were playing football at the lake. Watching football? You won’t even use a mobile. So stubborn! You can’t be found when we need you. Why did you suddenly need me so urgently? -I don’t have time today. -Why? For God’s sake, the President has sent a car for you. Okay, he sent car for me. I’ll send him a letter. -What the hell... -Why don't you put some sense into him? Borun, try to understand. Dear Punu... Let’s leave it for today. For many years we have not met. The words have piled up. Half an hour is not enough. You have lots of responsibility. Taking time out is difficult, I understand. I hope yesterday's situation is under control. The entire nation's responsibility is on your shoulders. I am touched that you thought of visiting me despite your busy schedule. But I cannot make it today. I am already committed to someone special who I cannot afford to disappoint. You will be coming to Kolkata again, we will catch up then. Take care, Biley. These huge pillars... James Princep was a great English scholar. Wait... I am coming.
