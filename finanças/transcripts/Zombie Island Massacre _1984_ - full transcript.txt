All present and accounted for. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, greater antilles sun tours welcomes you, and I, Reginald chamley Jones, your tour guide, welcome you too. Today our tour will take us to the fascinating island of Saint Marie, our neighboring Republic. We're confident that you're about to have one of the most exciting, fun-filled evenings of your entire lives. There is something for you all, seen to the taste of the artist, with an eye to the beauty of the exotic, to restless spirits in search of excitement, everywhere and anywhere, to the photographer who wishes to preserve this singular haven forever. For you sir, will be matchless scenes for wonderment. Strange activities for the students of life and human nature who wish to understand the wellspring of life mysteries. That's what the Caribbean is all about. This way. Come on. I can't wait to see what's there. Okay, here we have a French red port. Where are you taking me? It's a surprise. There are people upstairs. Don't worry, I paid the captain $20. We got complete privacy. I don't know, Joe. I really don't feel good about this. Oh, but I feel very good about this. Where were we? Oh, right about here. I don't believe this. I thought you paid $20. I did pay $20. Open up down there. Ethel has to go to the head. I do not deserve this. What the hell do you want? Come on, shake a leg. Why don't you just throw me over the side? For all the visitors who've come to our shores, you are to be congratulated above all. You are men and women of great taste and discrimination. You spare the inhibition for the love of the genuine. You have demanded a rare thing, and you shall have it on the beautiful island of Saint Marie. Okay, all right. Come on. Let's go. Step out. Come on, let's go. Right this way, ladies and gentlemen. Doesn't that look like a figurine? It does, doesn't it? I should've brought a camera. What you're about to see is not black magic, but truly a religious ceremony. Maintain a respectful silence. Watch your step. I don't think this is for me. Yeah, I think you're right. Don't worry, it's just an act. God, I hope you're right, Steve. Oh, honestly, Eddie, you're like a love-struck kid. I'm just hungry for you, baby. Ah, well, it's getting late. You're going to have to wait. Oh, you're as bad as you were before we got married. I still say we have to wait. And I say it's never too late for the love. Wow, do you believe this? I don't know. It's too scary for me. It's poppycock, don't worry about it. I don't know. I don't believe it. It's just a show. Seeing is believing. Hey, where's Donna? She couldn't handle it. She and ed took a walk in the middle of the mass. Nevermind them, where's our tour guide? That's right. Maybe the zombies kidnapped him. Don't make jokes, this is serious. We're all alone here, god knows where. Yeah, where is that character? This place is giving me the creeps. I am telling you, honey, it was only a show. Joe, I know what I saw. Here you are, reverend. This is for the church collection box. Thank you, Mr. Jones. We just aren't getting as many visitors as we used to. Yes, I'm aware of that, Mr. Jones. I'm sorry to hear that, reverend. Do not concern yourself, Mr. Jones. The gods will provide me with other means. Best you go look after our guests. Right you are, reverend. Mr. Jones, Take this to help you guide your way. Thank you, reverend, goodnight. Farewell, Mr. Jones, farewell. What was that? Simply the cry of a jungle bird, my dear. Where'd he come from? Now, my friends, I'd best get you back to the boat in time for dinner. This way, please. - Let's go. Let's get out of here. Jungle bird. Would someone please get those torches, please? Boy, I've had enough for one evening. Careful, watch your steps. Hey there, Roy! Here we are, start her up! Watch it now. - Let's get out of here. - Come on, Roy, start her up! I didn't think it'd be like this. If I knew it was gonna be like that, I wouldn't have taken you. Roy, Roy. Here. What's the problem? A bit of an accident I'm afraid. What kind of an accident? I'm sure I don't know, but our driver seems to have disappeared. Wait a minute, what's that? Haven't the foggiest. Hey, buster, we supposed to stand around her all night? The driver seems to have taken off. Hey, chamley, the keys are in here, let's go. Of course, of course, silly of me. - Yeah. - That's for sure. - Come on, everybody. - All aboard, let's go! Everything shipshape shortly. George, where do you wanna sit at? Here by the window, you wanna sit by the window? Look at this, everything we do something I'd rather not. - That's done. What's up, chamley? Oh, I can't believe this. Do you believe this? - Oh, boy. - I can't believe this. - What's the matter now? - Come on, chamley. Come on, come on, come on. Do you believe this? - My lord. - Come on, it's a motor. See you outside a minute. Where you goin'? That explains it. That explains what? Somebody took the distributor cap. Roy must've taken it with him. Yeah, why? So no one would steal the bus. Uh-huh, won't even do any good to hotwire. Hotwire? Just take my word for it. Without a distributor cap, we'll never get this thing moving. Well then there's only one thing for it. What? There's a phone booth just down the road. I'll have to go ahead and call for help. Hey, Paul, what's going on? I'll be with you in a minute. Listen, this is your tour, Mr. Jones. You got us here, you'll get us out. Oh, yes, yes, yes, of course, of course. That will be the thing to do, wouldn't it? Right, get with it. Sure. - Oh god, come on. - Come on. Probably makin' love somewhere. What's the holdup, huh? Looks like the driver hurt himself somehow. He must've gone to get help for himself. What's wrong with the motor? The driver took the distributor cap with him. What on earth for? So the natives wouldn't steal the bus, that's obvious. So what are we supposed to do now? Our charming guide's gone down the road to use the pay phone. I knew something terrible was gonna happen. Nothing terrible has happened. Every since they started playin' around with those dead bodies. This is dreadful. Lousy service, I say. I'm perfectly happy right here. Mm-hmm, I heard that. Hey, listen, while everybody's carrying on, what happened to the newlyweds? - Ed and Donna. - Oh they probably, they're fine. I completely forgot about them. We should look for 'em. Oh, I hope they're all right. I do too. Don't worry about them. Why not? You kiddin' me? Roy. Oh my god. Oh no. What in the name of god is happening? Who'd you study with? Adler? What? Steve? Steve? He went down the road. Down the road? Yeah, to see what's keepin' the tour man. Oh, yeah, sorry, still drowsy. That must be him now. What's the story? No story. What do you mean? I mean no tour guide, and the payphone was ripped up. Figures. So there's nothing, only this, his hat, and no chamley what's his name to go with it. I just knew something awful was gonna happen. You know, there's somethin' fishy about all this. Yeah, voodoo magic maybe. Hey, honey, don't make jokes. Sorry. Right, we've already lost two people. Plus the driver. And now the tour guide's abandoned us. So, what do we do now, Mr. big? Beats the hell outta me, not my kind of decision. What doesn't everybody just relax? This is supposed to be a fun picnic, remember? We can always contact the voodoo people. Not on your life. There's one thing I'm certainly not doing. What's that? Spending my night cooped up on this stupid bus. Yeah, this place is gettin' creepier by the minute. Wait a minute, there's always the house. What house? That villa a couple of miles down the road. I didn't see any villa. That's because you don't have my fine painter's eye. It's on the map. Hey, maybe they have a phone. Yeah, and maybe they don't. Listen, Joe, anything's better than just sitting here. With zombies coming to life over there, no thank you. Hey, hold your horses, maybe we'll be better off waiting here until morning. How many people wanna stay here tonight, or how many wanna try and get to the house? - I agree with Joe. - Hold it, hold it. Hold it, hold it. I agree with Joe. Let's try it again, this time with the hands. No, George, not with your condition. - Joel listen, some zombie cuts my throat, what good's my heart? We go with the majority. Okay, that's it, all hands, let's go. I guess it's okay. Take this. Why me? Angel, you're the one who saw the villa. You lead the way. I really don't think this is such a great idea. Just watch your footing. Okay, it's kinda treacherous. Oh, I'm right here, I'm right here. Hey, what's happening? Seeing what else we can use. This should come in handy for chopping a trail or something. Yeah, something like a zombie. Ah, here's a first-aid kit, in case we have to patch him up again. That's it? Nah, hold it, here's another light. Oh, yeah, this will light the way for the honeymooners. Great, but hurry up, okay? Just be careful, we'll make it. Everybody watch their step, okay? Here, let me have this back. Thanks. Hold up. What's wrong? The honeymooners, we, uh, we gotta try and tell 'em how to find the house. Well, how do we do that? I'll leave instructions. Anybody got some paper? - Yeah, I do. - I don't. Oh, good. Here, take this. Sure. You sure you wanna go back there? I'm sure I don't want them on my conscience. - Be careful. - Okay, but we'll take it slow, all right? Don't worry about it. There's only one road. You take care, all right. Hey, what happened? I forgot my books. That is not funny. - All right. - Do you think they're fine? What's so funny about being out in this jungle? I thought it was funny. There's someone coming! - Oh, Paul. - Hey, hey, Paul. Hey, Paul, what happened? - Yeah, Paul. - Tell me. Got jumped, that's what happened. It was hidin' on the bus. That son of a bitch hit me like a ton of bricks. Well, who was it? Who the hell knows? The voodoo people. Sandy, you got voodoo of the mind. Well, who else? Well, maybe it was that driver, maybe he went off his rocker or something. He looked like a weed head to me right from the start. It wasn't the driver. A zombie perhaps? Here, you tell me. What's that? I chopped it off him, whatever it is. Maybe one of them savages. It looks like a bird or a bear. Look, it doesn't matter who right now, all I know is homicidal, you read me? It was trying to kill me, got it? Okay, so where in the hell is this house of yours? As a matter of fact it's right up there. At least there's still a light in the window. Oh, George, this is no time for jokes. Laughter's the best medicine. The reader's digest says so. George, you're incorrigible. - Among other things. - All right, let's go. Let's try to make it, all right? We're right behind you. We're almost there now. Maybe we'd be better off on our own. There just a bunch of jinx. Suit yourself, Matt, with me, it's safety in numbers. Jesus, some people. Stop complaining. He nearly took my eye out. The only thing puttin' your eye out is that pretty young butt up front there. What in the hell you talkin' about? Matt, Matt, I'm runnin' out of steam here. What do ya want, upper or downer? Come on, upper, upper. Here. Thanks, hon. If I'd known it was this steep. I know, we wouldn't be here. I don't love the sound of that drum. Drummer you know? Hold it a sec. What's the problem now? Not sure. You smell it? Yes, skunk cabbage. Yeah, it smells like rotten eggs. No, rotten meat. I smelled it back at the bus. It's following us. Oh god. It's okay, let's not panic. Hey, we're almost there. The house can't be but another quarter of a mile or so down the path. - George, George! George, oh my god, my god, it's his heart, George. George. Oh my god, George. Oh my god, it's his heart. Damn! - Come on. - Come on, do something. Oh, George. Here, George. All right. Oh, George. Do you think we can carry him? Yeah, we could, but we shouldn't. Yeah, I read you, so what do we do? You guys go up to the house and get help if you can. Well, what about you? I'll stay here with him until you get back. Yeah, but what about... Get goin', I'll hold the fort. Okay, folks. Paul and George are gonna take a little rest here, the rest go to the house and get help, okay? I'm not leaving him! I'll look after him. I am not leaving him! Okay, we'll go for help and be back before you know it. I'm not leaving him. - Come on, honey. - George. He's gonna be fine, right? He's gonna be fine. Watch it, Joe. I'm gonna go first. One at a time. It's beautiful, come on. Hey, you're all so slow. Make way, come on. Some of these things are loose. Hey, Sandy, this isn't very sturdy. Come on, honey. Watch out. Jerry. It's all right, it's all right. Come on. I'm comin', all right. Jerry! Helen! - Jerry! - Jerry! Helen! Helen! Go on, do something! It's too late! I can't see them! - Oh my god! - Helen, Jerry! Helen! Hey, what's that? Do you see him? I don't know, there's something over there. Jerry! - My god. Jerry! What happened? An accident. Helen and Jerry, they went under, slipped, I think. You think? It was hard to tell. Listen, Helen was almost over to the other side, and then suddenly she was falling in the water. Yeah, and Jerry dove in to help her. What's the matter, didn't they see something over there? Oh, Paul, it happened so quickly. It was over like that. Hey, Joe, hey, Matt, did you see what happened? What? No. Man, it's so dark I can't see anything. Damn! Steve. Oh, take it easy, hon. I can't take much more of this. Bastard, come out! Come on, we can't wait around here all night! Hold your horses, we're waiting for Paul. Bad? Yeah. Oh god. Both of them? Yeah. What do we do? We can't leave 'em there. We can, unless you go suicide. Who was it? Did you see what it was? No. Must've been some kind of crazy, human or not. Listen, let's get to the house first, then decide what to do, okay? Yeah, right, you two go ahead. What happened, how did she fall in? - I couldn't see. - Hey hero, thought you were gonna stay back there and cover our asses. From now on, Matt, you better cover your own ass. What's that supposed to mean? It means that some thing out there is after us. You gotta be kidding. What did we do to anybody? Yeah, who knows? It doesn't seem to matter. Paul, tell them. George and Ethel, they're both dead. Murdered. Oh my god. First Helen and Jerry, and now George and Ethel. Somebody out there wants us all dead. Sure? You wanna stay and check it out? Keep goin', baby. Matt, take it easy. We'll take it easy as soon as we get to this house up there. Whoa, we better think this one over. Why? Why? Because that nutcase may be operating out of the house. Yeah, who knows? But right now he's behind us across the river there, so. So we check out the house, okay? Okay. I knew we never should've come. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Mexico would've been so much nicer. Yeah all those greasers with their guitars. I love guitars. - Come on. - Let's get out of here. - Let's go. - Come on, come on. Let's go. Jesus, what the hell is going on? Don't stop and think about it. We've got a road. - Nice, nice. - Fantastic. Connie, you're right, here is the house. Watch your step. Now we can get to the telephone. Hello? Anybody home? If Igor answers, I'm leaving. Igor? You know, Igor, Dr. Frankenstein's Butler. Sick. No, I'm not sick, just playing it safe. - Look at his place. - Hello? Anybody home? It's an emergency, we need a telephone. Hello! Does anybody have a match? Yeah. Ah, civilization. It's like everybody left in a hurry. If they left. And what's that supposed to mean? Well they could, couldn't they? Paul, let's check it out. Keep an eye on the girls, okay? Okay. I've got a splitting headache. Small wonder, I think I've got some aspirin. Just like a girl scout. Always prepared. Thank you. Let's see if we can find some water. A light. You don't bother him, he won't bother you. More good news, no dead bodies upstairs. Ladies, I'll take care of this. You know, if you ask me, I think everybody is missing the point. Oh, and what's that? Well, I think we should be trying to get in touch with someone to tell 'em what's happening to us. J da da da da da da da da here's some more news, good and bad. First the bad news. No telephone calls, that's out. And now the good news. Now we got some real protection. Where the hell did you find that? Out in the backyard. So they had a shootout here. I told you they could all be dead. Is that thing loaded? Yeah, but only two rounds. Please, Joe, be careful. Don't worry, I've been handling guns all my life. Is that a fact? That is a fact. Can I take a look? If you're gonna wear it like that, you better keep it like this. An accident wouldn't make Sandy very happy, or you, baby. Ah. Oh no. Terrific. Damn it. Just what we need. Damn it. Old places like this, they're usually on generators. We'd better check the basement. You three will be okay. Are you kidding, with this Cannon? Come on, Joe. This is not high noon. Please put that away until we really have reason to use it. All right. God, watch that grate on the floor. This looks like it. Give it a crank. Ah. Hey, anybody know what anthropophagy or phagy is? Mm-mm, not I. Joe. Joe. What? You took anthropology 35, you oughta know. How do you spell it. Well, it's anthro, and then it's P-o-p-h-a-g-y. Cannibalism. What? Oh my god. This whole shelf here in German, French, and Italian, and all on cannibalism. Hey, you know, you're right. Ah, what do they say? Different strokes for different folks. - Joel hey. What's wrong? That awful smell, it's back again. Jesus, I forgot to lock the door! Connie, warn the other guys. Go. Sandy, get outta sight. Sandy, go. I can't move. Don't move. Joe! Shh. Don't leave me. I promise I'll be right back. Joe, don't go. Okay, good, go ahead. All righty. Steve, the zombie's trying to break in. Joe, hey, Joel you all right? Just one shot. Bastard's quick as lightning. Goodbye 38. Goodbye Joe, too. The bad guy's got it now. You wanna go up against him with just that? No way. It's that monster. That thing got him. I asked him not to leave me. Told him not to go out there. I pleaded with him. But no, no, had to be the cowboy, just like a little boy, playin' stupid cowboy. This just can't be happening. I don't believe that I'll never see him again. He was always playing tricks on me, little boy tricks, scary sometimes, but always fun. We'd fight and make up, but it was just a big game between us. I can't believe it was the last time, I just can't. It's not fair, and I won't believe it. I need you, Joe. Sandy, maybe he'll turn up. Turn up? What, like the others? Lying in a filthy pit, skinned like a rabbit! Sandy, that's not gonna happen. He was such a sweet guy, like a little boy, but he was gentle and sweet. I'll get the lights. It's up here. We can't go up against a 38 with just that. There's only one slug left. You wanna be a hero? No thanks, how "bout you? Wait a minute. Well, what else is there? Quarter coil stretching. Steve! Let's get the hell out of here. What's going on? A welcoming mat. For our friend the zombie. You mean fried zombie. I certainly hope it works. How you comin'? Okay, I'm set. All right, let's scoot it the rest. Were you really serious? About you? Very serious. Lucky me, after all, this is Caribbean, isn't it? Boy meets girl, vice versa. I meant about fried zombies. Listen, I don't know what to believe anymore. Walking corpses, zombies, bacchus or whatever. What do you think, Paul? Up till now, all the monsters that I've seen has been human. I've give anything. Where'd he go? He just disappeared. We'll just try and find out what happened to Joe. Hey, Steve. Look. Looks like it goes off this way. Ah, jeez. Just one round left. Too bad he didn't have time to use it. Let's hope we do. Hold it right there, mister. Anything you say, friend. What are you doing here? Oh, I'm trackin' that critter that just bust outta here. You get him? No, no, he moves faster than lightning, but I will eventually though. Okay, come up, but nice and slow. Oh, that's the only way I can take it. I've been Mickey mousing around these jungles for the past two, three days. What have you been doing out there? I told ya, I've been trackin' that thing, or things. Name's Whitney, ely Whitney. I had a house over there, other side of the valley. Had a house? Yeah, yeah, he burned me out. It's custom around here, it seems. Me, I'm from Boston originally. I retired down here to get away from those new england winters. What do I get instead, huh? What did you get? Trouble, trouble, there's nothing but trouble. From the critter? Killed my wife, murdered my partner. Who did that? Political terrorists, Indians, crazy on ganja weed, or maybe some prehistoric tribe, beats me. Bloodthirsty's all I know, miss, uh? Sorry, Mr. Whitney, this is Sandy, this is Connie. Ladies. Well, you boys plan to spend the night out here? Okay, hang on. Where's Joe? Still no sign of him. I don't understand, Steve. Hey, you didn't see Joe, did ya? Who? Joe. Her boyfriend. Oh, uh, I'm sorry, but there's nobody else out there, alive anyway. Is it the voodoo people who took him away? Oh, I really don't know. Well, a bunch of us came up from the port for the voodoo mass, and ever since then it's been nothing but trouble. Are these murderers, these monsters, are they cannibals? Well, where the devil did you get that idea? Because the bookcase in there is full of books on cannibalism. Oh, well, well, I'll tell ya. When Columbus first arrived here, these islands were inhabited by the arawak Indians. They were beastly types, but then they were invaded by the caribs. They came up from Columbia or Venezuela they were fierce and bloodthirsty types. They swept through the islands of Cuba and Haiti and Jamaica. All the islands that we know today as the caribbeans. Now, the language that they spoke was cariban. The Latin form for cariban is cannibal, the flesh eaters. Well, that's what the caribs really were. Well, I don't know what to say about it for today, but frankly, I don't like to even think about it. Is there some place here that I could wash up a bit? Sure, I'll show you. Thank you. What the hell has gone wrong? Everything! And now what do we do? Later, we've got to get them out of this house. We're gonna try and hold 'em till morning, then we'll make a run for it. The shotgun will be a big help. It should be light in two hours. And then what'll we do? Then we tear up and run for it. Yeah, if we have the time. You know something we don't? No, but maybe we should ask Mr. Whitney, he seems to be the local expert. Expert, expert on what? What to expect next. Well, I don't think that anybody will be safe here any longer. Why not? As I've told you, arson is a way of life around here. You look at a man cross-eyed, and the next thing you know, he's burning down your house. As you've learned, there's a lot of things that are an issue here. Therel look. What the hell do we do now? Hide in the jungle. Oh, that wouldn't work. Why not? Well, they're expert trackers. They'd furrow us out in no time. What else is there? Ambush. Are you kidding? There's a million miles of jungle out there. True, but we know where they are now, down by the road, and to get here, they'll have to cross the river. Now, human or subhuman, they'll take the shortest route, and especially since you've wounded one of them. Okay, let's get organized. Come on, Sandy. Here, here, here, you take these. You're in better shape than I am to handle the thunder blast. Out this way. We've got to get to the river first. Joe! Joel Joe. - Come on, let's get out of here. No. No. Are you all right? It's all right, it's just a little spill. I twisted somethin'. Can you walk? I'm afraid not. You go on ahead, I'll be all right. We can't leave him here alone. No, no, go, my dear, go ahead, I'll be just fine. Listen, we can't waste anytime. Exactly, you've got to get to the river first. You go ahead, I'll hide us in the underbrush. You sure? Positive. Sandy? I'll go with the two of you. Okay, we'll come back for you after it's over. I love you, angel. Me, too. Now what the hell is going on here? Oh, my dear girl, it's all very involved. So uninvolve it, spell it out. Well, on the last shipment from Bogota, my business associates, our local horse-wild friends, they resorted to the classic. The what? Double-cross, and then he paid off the Colombians in counterfeit, and then he and his girlfriend planned to skip with the real green. And so what happened? Well, the cowboys, they burned 'em out. They turned 'em into chopped meat. Those savages, they come up in the middle of the night and tossed a couple of molotov cocktails. The swoosh, a lifetime of work goes up in smoke and flames. Here everybody has to handle his own problems. We've got no fire department. But that was the last problem Hernandez and his whore had to face. That's only half of it. And the other half? Well, there's an informant on your end. An informant? When the Colombians got a tip that someone in this tour group had the cash on this trip, they sent up a hit squad. Fingered directly? Oh, absolutely not. They just simply started eliminating you one by one, and then searching through the bags for the payment. And what's the drill now? Business as usual, my dear. But what about all that needless hacking up of all those people? My dear girl, it's all part of the subculture. Women, children, and even babies are not immune to their revenge or instruction, plus the fact that I imagine that someone employed in torture, who's got the goodies and all of that. I don't find it amusing. Oh no, well, my dear girl, it's all part of the total scene. There's fun and games and good times. Isn't that what it's all about, huh? Sorry. Just give me a second. Seems that you're a bit out of condition, my dear. This hit squad, Whitney, why do they smell so awful? Why, it's rotten bark and trees and slimy jungle things. It's a concoction that they smear on themselves so they smell like rotting corpses. Certainly isn't Chanel, is it? Oh, you're beginning to feel a little better, I see. Well, it's true, but it keeps the local primitives at arm's length, and it reminds them of their zombies and it keeps them at distance. It's really quite amusing though. You've got a great sense of humor, Whitney. I'll die laughing. I rather doubt it. Hernandez and his whore certainly didn't. Well, we beat 'em to it. Okay, let's cross fire. All right, Sandy, you get behind Paul, all right, come on. Gonna take that, come on. Steve, looks like somebody's on our side. On! Tell, tell, my. Your wife, your folks? Tell, tell Miami. Miami? Tell Miami, d-e-a. You're not dead yet, I'll get help. DEA, drug enforcement agency, looking for connection. With us? Like 10 little Indians, only one left. You help. I promise. Sandy. Sandy! What was all that shooting about? The boys from Bogota greeting your friends. Those animals been following us all night? Trust that everything has been properly settled. I hate loose ends. Careful, my dear. Well, you certainly seem at home. Might as well, too, this is my house. But the buyer, you said... Ah, that was Hernandez. Cocaine cowboys, they wanted me alive and well, at least until I completed the last transaction. You have it? Of course. Well, let me see it. Let's see the candy first. You are a tough customer. I've always been a great believer of Edgar Allan poe, the purloined letter, you know? You wanna hide something, you hide it in plain sight. Have no fear, it's top grade. Number nine rock. Yeah, but you're supposed to have enough for 10 mules to haul back to the states. After I see your end, my dear. Five million, us. 25 million on your end. Ah, but I'm the one taking the chance getting it back to New York. Ah, back to your little discotheques and playpens. My dear friend, don't knock it if you don't know it. Of course not, my dear. Right this way, my dear girl. Now, just keep your eye on it. Now, ah-hah, magic. Ooh, one, two. Very efficient. Efficiency is the key to industry and profit. Steve, you startled me. Yeah, I'll bet. Where are the others? Back out there dead. Calm down. We were ambushed just like your friend here planned. My dear young fellow, you give me too much credit. Steve please, put that thing away. You don't need it here, we're all friends. I can see that. Money makes strange bedfellows. Young man, this is strictly a business transaction. For how much? A few hundred thousand. So, 12 people dead for a few hundred thousand? I'm a generous man, young fellow, and now that you're with us, I'd be delighted to share with you. Not on your life. But I owe it to you. Since you've done away with those animals that have been hounding me. Start running, baby, 'cause I got news for you, the feds are. The next one's for you. Are you crazy? You just killed that poor man. Poor man my ass! He's another greedy pig like you. Steve, use your head. I'm not talking thousands, I'm talking millions. Good to hear. Tell Paul and Sandy and all the others dead out there. Forget about them. I had nothing to do with that. Can't you think of the living and the living that we can do together? Living? What about the loving? Wasn't that part of the package too, angel? The loving, of course it is. You just told me you love me only an hour ago. Could I possibly change so much in so little time? No, you haven't changed, I have. My god, Steve, please don't kill me. Kill you? That's not my plan. What are you going to do with me? Turn you in, sweetheart. A dealer like you should only be 20 years to life. Steve, that's not fair. I'm not playing a sap for you anymore, angel. Get moving, baby. I'm frightened, Steve. You didn't mind leading us up here. 1 can't help it, I'm scared now, please. Don't worry, both sides were wiped out except for you and me. Steve please. Get moving. Look, whatever happens, I want you to know one thing, that I really love you. Okay, maybe in the beginning I was, I was playing you along, but the way you stood up tonight. I gotta hand it to you. When you lie, you lie beautifully. Oh god, no, not a lie. The truth, maybe for the first time in my life. And for whatever it's worth to you, I really did fall in love with you. Whatever happened in that house, had nothing to do with you or me. I really need you in my life. Steve! God. You took too long to reach me, Mr. Jones. I'll take that now. No way. We needn't quarrel, sir. Let me go! Let me go! Sandy! Steve! Simply quid pro quo. I told you the gods would provide. Now, Mr. Jones will escort you back to your boat. This way, folks. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Jones tours welcomes you. L, Reginald chamley Jones, your tour guide, welcome you personally. Our tour today, are you reporting, sir? This way, please.
