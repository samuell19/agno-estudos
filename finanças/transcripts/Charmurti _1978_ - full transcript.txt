Thirty six marks in the mathematics test yesterday? Really I am very sorry, Tinnida. I did not realise that I have written thirty six marks answer correctly. If I knew I would have certainly strike through and left. What were you doing in today's exam? Fail! - Lair! You think I didn't see? What were you writing in the answer paper, tell me? Hey Tinnida! I swear I didn't write anything. I was drawing - Is it? Yes! Palm trees, the sky, river. Are you speaking the truth? - I swear on you, Tinnida. If I got a little more time, I would have.. Drawn a fish in the river. A fish along with a lot of babies. How did you write your exam, Tinnida? Oh! how did you write your exam, Tinnida!? Don't you know how Tinnida writes his exam? What is it? Hey show me.. show me.. show me! Give me the stick.. give me the stick! Wow! Why do you ask such stupid question? Do you have to ask to know how I write my papers? How many times is it now? What? You perhaps started with Intern exam. You wrote Metric.. You wrote School Final. Now perhaps it's Higher Secondary! That's why I asked, how many times including this? How many times!? There's only three to eat, Pela, Habul and Tinnida. Why are you worried about who will eat? Just do what I asked you to do. You have done such a big preparation. Let's hope we don't have to give this away to the beggars at last. Will you stop!? It's once in a while that the boys will.. Enjoy such good food and you are just grumbling. I understood. - What? It's not the boys.. it's the boy! What do you mean? - Tinnida! What will be your result? - Zero! Is there no chance of passing? - No! You had to work for it? - Of course! People work hard to pass the exams. And you people work hard to fail. This is also an art! You will repent, just grow up a little more. - Stop it! Tinnida has been failing year after year since ages. Is he not enjoying life like us? Tell me. How could you dare to compare with Tinnida!? Yes! I have drawn such a nice picture in today's answer sheet. The examiner will get it framed and keep it at his home. You are the perfect follower of Tinnida. All hail the master! What's the matter, Habul? He didn't come yet! Did he forget? Who Tinnida!? The person who forgets everything.. At the mention of food. How could he ever forget about this invitation!? Then why isn't he coming? What is the time, brother? Five past eight. - Okay! Isn't it Tinni!? - Hey Tinni! I was going for a good job and you interrupted! What? - You wrote Exam again this time, how was it? How it always had been!? The Mathematics paper is very simple this time. What do you say? - I shall move! Ah! Listen.. listen to me. My nephew was saying that the questions this time.. Are so easy this time that even the most stupid person could pass. Why!? Can't you? Why are you grumbling? Tell me. I am telling you that I have to go for an important work. I will be in loss if I don't reach there. There is something about eating.. Leave me! Hey you all! - Come, uncle sit. No, I won't sit now, I will go to eat. I am very hungry. But the chief guest has not come yet! Chief guest!? Who? - Tinnida! How can we sit to eat without Tinnida? Oh I see! Brother, what's the time? - Twelve past eight. Oh no! Isn't it Tinni!? - Hey, Tinni! We will talk later! So what do you say, uncle? Shouldn't we find out about Tinnida? See if you ask me then.. After all.. I didn't miss it. I thought.. it all started. Why are you so late? And late.. I was on my way and one after the other.. People emerging in front of me. Tenni, how did you write your exam!? It seems they can't digest their food.. Till they come to know, how I wrote my exam. Hey, what's going on inside? Go and see for yourself. Okay then, I will go and see. Aunt! - So you have come! Yes aunt, will it take you too long to serve the food? No just a while. Oh.. then.. You go and sit, I will send the food. Okay! Okay! Actually I was feeling hungry. The hunger might die if it is too late, that's why. Okay! I will sit in that room, aunt. Okay? - Yes go. What fun! The people are getting so dull these days. They are asking me, Tinni how did you.. Hey! Hey! Look, Pela you Can't digest this. Just one!? - Okay take just one. Don't ask for more. One for me also! - You also take one. You take it. Take this. Isn't it fine? What!? This is preparing the ground. If there have been souse with this.. There is no use of sauce now. No use! All right then, I will eat later. Oh no.. I think I got hungrier. Hurry up, Mia! How long should the boys starve!? Why should they starve!? I just served them a full plate. Just that much isn't enough while you are hungry. What did you say!? Just that much!? You better sit Tinni all right!? I will better go inside and ask them to be fast. Tinnida, I was thinking of something. You see our results will be out in about two three months. Let's go out for a trip somewhere. I am ready.. the change will be specially helpful to me. I am also ready. But Tennida!? - Will you go and see how's it proceeding inside? I will.. I will. But will you go? Did I say I won't go? Hurrah! The proposal is passed. But where should we go? Why!? Let's go! There's a wide open ground. There are even mango trees and jack fruit trees. We will have a lot of fun. Where? - It's my aunt's house. Let's go there. But tell us where? There in Liluya! Heard him!? Hopeless fellow! He has.. long ears like a goat and his brain is also like a goat. Liluya! After all he found out such a nice place, Liluya! Instead why not go to Hathibagan!? We will get a good change! Why not go to the roof top for a change, who's stopping? All non sense peoples' stupidity! Here I am Starving to death and they have no concern! Should I say something? What? - My eldest maternal is, DSP in police. He is very commanding man. When he takes the road people move away left and right.. left and right. He is such a strict person. Who wants to know the history of your uncle!? Just say where should we go! Where my uncle lives now. Again!? - Oh just listen! My uncle now lives in Burdwan. If you would like to go, tell me. I will make the arrangements. What, Tennida? - Burdwan! Tell me, Habul how much is a Kg of Sitabhog.. And Mihidana (Bengali sweets) in Burdwan? Why to bother for Kg uncle gets it free. I see.. it's not bad.. it's not bad It's a lot better than Liluya. Of course! But do you know the size of a mosquito in Burdwan? Each one is as big as a sparrow. If two, no one of them gets inside your mosquito net.. Then it will eat you up. You don't have to eat the sweets. Stop.. stop don't keep grumbling! He is scaring me of mosquitoes.. Scaring me of mosquitoes.. All right! You will come to know. That Liluya is still bothering your mind. The Liluya air has swollen you up like a wrestler. He is an idiot! I was thinking of the saying in Sanskrit, Rajkulasucha. His uncle is a DSP in police. Will it be wise to get near a policeman? See, Kebla don't try to scare me of police. You know, all the Sergeants in Calcutta salute me when they see me. So then what's the decision? Burdwan is not a bad place.. But quiet good. Mihidana and all are well. But I was thinking of a place far away.. very far away.. It was a dense forest. To hunt... What happened? Are you telling story about hunting? - Yes. Even I went to forest for hunting. I was wearing a half pant and a half shirt.. A cap on my head and a gun on my shoulder. We kept going.. going. It was a dense forest you see!? You could see the glimpse of the sun here and there. Anyways, we kept going and all of a sudden.. We see a dense bush and this big flowers on it. What a lovely sight and what nice colours! Beautiful! Then I left my companion behind.. And approached the bush. I was advancing one step, one step, one step, towards those flowers. On getting near, I saw something like this hanging in the middle of the flowers. It was swinging like this with blowing air. I though it is also some kind of flower. Thinking so I grabbed it. Oh my dear! It wasn't a flower! Then what!? - It was the tail of a live buffalo. What!? - Yes. Now can you understand my condition? Once I have grabbed the tail so can't let it go. I am holding on to it tightly. As there was a sudden tension.. The buffalo took a leap and started to run. The buffalo is running I am also running.. The buffalo is running I am also running. That was a terrible situation. The buffalo couldn't turn back and see as it was terrified.. And I could not let go the tail. I am holding on tightly. Running.. Running.. Running.. Running, suddenly I see the buffalo is no where! Escaped!? - Escaped. There is no one? - No one. It escaped but the tail remained in my hands. What!? - Yes, come to my house some day, I will show. The buffalo was so scared that.. It left the tail behind and just vanished. Just think how will it be when it returns home. A buffalo with a missing tail. Hey! Why are you laughing? Mother said everything is ready there. Ready! Wow.. wow.. Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, it's time for dinner. I never met someone like him. - A fool like him, right? Get up from here! - Why? Get up, this is my place. Oh no! - I am telling you this is my place. No! - See, uncle he is sick, still longing for food. Yes.. yes. Child, Pelaram you sit there. Sit there and see that Tenni shouldn't overeat. Come on, get up quickly. Sit. Sit. Pela, aunt has done this special arrangement for Tinnida.. Why do you want it? Get started.. get started.. eat. Should I? - Yes. What is that you served, aunt? Murho. (head of fish) - Whose is it.? Habul, I warn you! Oh my! - Do not talk, Habul, I will hit you. So what about our trip? The boys want to go somewhere for a trip. Oh! Then go to your uncle's place. Where to Uluberia!? What do you say, Tinnida? Leave it.. leave it, nothing will go into his head now. You can talk later. May I help you, Tinnida? He gets sick on drinking simple water.. And he wants to help me! What up, Tinnida? Isn't it over? Now get up! Pela, Oh Pela! - Yes. It's enough to get just One such meal every month. Why once in a month!? You can manage even ten such meals in a day. You all get jealous to see me eat like this, isn't it? No - It's only because I eat like this that.. I could maintain such a strong body. Don't you remember, do you? Once a British sergeant was riding a horse across the ground. I snatched him down, he came aggressively to get me arrested. I.. I just puffed up my biceps and showed him my fist. That's all, he couldn't dare to come near me. Since then.. Since then all the British sergeants.. In Kolkata salutes me whenever they see me. Didn't know about this! Didn't know about this! How could you? I am a rural yogi, I keep on mixing up with you people.. So you people think that I am a worthless fellow. Hey! How did you enjoy the food? Ask Tinnida. Listen, Habul! I will hit you. You, Kebla tell me did I too much? No.. no it was not too much. Mother was saying she will serve us.. Another such meal when our results get out. She will serve us another such meal!? Yes, but what about our trip? What boys, what have you decided? Come, uncle! can you suggest where could we go? Tenni was talking about hunting and all.. So I suggest you to go to Hazribagh. Hazribagh!? - Yes. It is a good place for hunting. Once I almost got eaten up by a tiger there! What!? - Yes! A tiger this time and not a buffalo. Number two. At least listen to it. How it goes you know!? That.. hunter friend of mine the one.. About whom I told you before. One evening, you see!? Both of us started of with our guns and all. Then we started to move forward.. Going.. going.. A little further, we climbed up a tree. Now how was the tree you know!? This is the trunk.. this is the trunk. And a branch this side and another this side. I sat this side and he sat the other side, I mean my friend. Sitting there for a long time I started to get drowsy. I was about to close my eyes leaning on the tree. All of a sudden.. suddenly I feel something hitting me here. Yes! Looking at my friend I see, he is gesturing.. Me to keep silence and was pointing downwards. I couldn't understand, I wondered what's the matter after all! Suddenly looking down I see a tiger! Yes a huge tiger, alive! Strolling there.. Strolling there.. And howling in between. Now do you realise my condition then!? My head was spinning.. Zoom.. zoom.. zoom. O my God! All of a sudden I see the tiger looking up. Just straight at my eyes. Yes! And as we got eye to eye.. My eyes started to close. My hands numb, legs numb, the whole body numb. I was focusing and then suddenly a tiger came and I was shocked. Suddenly I heard.. I fainted as soon as I dropped on the tiger's back. And the tiger was so stupid that as soon as.. I fell on it's back.. It also fainted. Tiger fainted? - Yes. Let me touch your feet. Leave it.. leave it.. leave it. And then you know!? That friend of mine.. He is very courageous.. He climbed down the tree. After that he sprinkled water on my face.. And in a while I gained senses. But the tiger.. The tiger was still unconscious. Now, what to do! That was a grim situation. So we got a bamboo and tied the tiger tightly to it. And then got it straight away to Calcutta Zoo by train. You won't believe if I tell you.. But the tiger did not come to senses in two and half days. Still unconscious. Then what to do!? So we called a renowned doctor. The doctor had smelling salt. That you smell.. smell. He held that near the tiger's nose like this. Slowly.. slowly.. Slowly the tiger got consciousness. Got consciousness!? - He was lucky. Or else he would have suffered a lot. Then you all do as I said.. Go to Hazribagh. I will get all the arrangements done. No.. no they shouldn't go to that forests with beasts. They are just kids. Whom do you call kids!? Get them bows and arrows.. They will conquer the whole world and return home safely. Yes! I too.. I too gave such a hit to a sergeant on the.. who is it!? We.. We are not going to the land of beasts. We want to go to some far off place.. nearby. Then do one thing, I will tell you a place. You go there. You won't get such a healthy place. Where? Raanchi? Not Raanchi.. not Raanchi. Then it must be Gobordanga. Habul! You have a kilo of cow dung in your head. Gobordanga! I will give such a blow to your head. Hey listen! The place I am talking about is called Jhuntipahar. Jhuntipahar!? - Jhuntipahar! It is surrounded with teakwood and Mahagony. Only fifty paisa for a ser of milk, a chicken for just one rupee. And so many variety of fish. Eat to your heart's content and have fun all around. If you spend one month there then you all will become stout. But where do we stay? In the jungle!? Why in the jungle? I have bought a bungalow there. Bought a bungalow! When!? It's.. it's about a few months. There we are! Wow.. everyday, everyday a full chicken roast! What do you say? - Yes. Okay, uncle you said you get fish there! Yes you get. Do you gat Paka Pona? (Small fish of sweet water) Yes you get. - Wow.. wow Grande! What, Pela why are you quiet? What should I say? You purchase some prawns and vegetables. Because you won't be able to digest chicken and all. But will it be right to let them go that far away? Mother, you don't get scared. Uncle has assured. Moreover I will be there! Then when do you think to go? As soon as possible. All right, you get ready, I will make all the arrangements. Wow! It will be great fun. You know, Tinnida Gobordanga is.. I have no.. interest in Gobordanga. Mother you go to Habul's house.. This change is specially helpful for me. But boys! There is a little problem. Problem!? What problem? No, it's not that significant. I mean there is a disturbance in that house. This is so disturbing, Mr. Rai! The boys have decided everything and now you are saying.. It is not that serious.. It is not that serious. Those locals were saying that there in the garden.. Some people move around aloud. And some strange noises can be heard. But no one could be seen. See, I just went twice there after purchasing the house. I went in the morning and came back in the evening. Whatever happens in the night, I don't know. So I wanted to know if you will be scared to go? Scared!? Huh! Tenni would fear ghosts!? I just do not believe in ghosts. Let the ghosts come, I will wrap him up and throw.. Tennida! O Tennida! What, Tenni You said you do not believe in ghosts. And just seeing the cat's eyes you.. Ghosts.. be.. Ba.. this.. this Pela is coward. So I.. got him scared. - Yes indeed! Can you go to my bungalow? Can you go to my bungalow? Sure. Slowly.. slowly.. put it up. Put it up.. put it up this side. Put.. put it here. Put the suitcase here. Money sir? - Money? Yes! Here is your money. One rupee more, sir! - What!? One rupee more! - Are you trying to be smart? How much is your rate? - Two rupees, sir! Show me your batch! - See, sir! This is a fake batch! - No, sir it's real! What do you think.. we are boarding the train for the first time? What's the matter? - Look, sir! Hey stop I will explain. - How much did you pay? I paid one rupee. - Give him one more. Ah.. money is worthless or what? You are going out, give him willingly. No this way they will get spoiled. Give him.. give him. All right.. look.. take this and look.. never do like this. All right!? Now go.. go. Hey, where did you keep my bedding? Hey Habul! Where did you keep my bedding? Don't you hear me!? - How do I know!? What do you mean by how do I know? What, Pela? - Search it.. search it! Search.. ah.. in dust, mud.. You, Pela you move away from the window.. You are so lean, you will catch cold. What!? - move.. move.. move. Why should I? I came and sat first, why should I move? Just get up I say! - No.. no. You will catch cold I am saying! What's the matter again? Look, uncle I am telling Pela.. You are a thin fellow you will catch cold sitting by the window. Who will look after you if you fall sick!? He is not listening to me. I am suffocating in the heat and.. He is saying I will catch cold. How dare you to argue with me!? Hey you come here and sit. You will get coal chips in your eyes.. Even if you do not catch cold. Okay you come here, son - Come this side. Go! - Sit.. sit Is it right to let them go all alone like this? What's wrong? Just wait and watch what wonder they do there. What wonder will they do there? They are all gem of boys! They would have left to conquer the world.. At this age if it had been the olden days. What Tinni? - Yes. But I am not assured. Tinni dear, you.. You just do not worry aunt. Till I am there.. Hey Pela, what is it? - What? That you just hid. - What did I hide? Nothing! Hid nothing!? Here you see aunt, could I bring him back.. In one piece if he eats this whole pack of biscuits. I will keep it. I will ration it, you see. Two in the morning and two in the evening.- Two!? Yes two, if you want more.. Okay boys! you all be safe, all right? Let's go.. let's go.. let's go. Oh listen, the gardener of the bungalow will come to receive you at the station. Do you remember the gardener's name? Yes - Tell me what? Jhonturam - Yes Jhonturam. Then you take care in the journey. Wait and watch. What has happened my son? Give him some hard words, Tinnida. Stop! Don't try to be smart. What has happened? Boys! This.. I mean is this bedding your's? Yes.. why? No.. it fell on my shoulders suddenly.. I couldn't understand, from where. You didn't throw it, I am sure!? Shame.. shame Could I throw it!? My disciple came to see me off, he threw it. See I told you, a holy man cannot do so. It is just common sense.. No.. no my disciple is very intelligent. Then he must not have seen while throwing. He threw it while seeing. But on my shoulders, if I would have got hurt!? Then you had to go to the hospital. But, son why did you stand at the door like that? So right on my shoulders!? Shut up! Go and sit there. Move aside.. whose is this!? Move it. My bedding! - Shut up! Put your bed up. This is fine! - Don't be nervous, Habul don't be nervous. I am here. Why be afraid? Where are you going, boys? - Ramgarh. You? I.. I will get down at Muri. Are you all are going for a trip? What are you murmuring? Are you hurt? No.. no. How could I get hurt? Such a small bedding! No.. no you are hurt a little. I can understand looking at your face. Don't be upset, son. You know, what happened to me once? That time also I was going to Muri. The train was fully packed, not a little space left. So what I did, spread my bed on floor.. And went to sleep.. So bumpy it is! So then, I was just about to fall asleep. Just then a huge Kabuliwala fell on me.. From the bunk along with his bag of asafetida. This is amazing! Yes, but I wasn't hurt a bit. It means you are great! Let us touch your feet. Hey get up! Up.. Up. Touch his feet.. touch his feet. Leave it.. leave it. I will bestow my blessings on them from here only. Where's the other foot? - There it is. All right sage! - You caught it? Sage If you please tell your name.. My name! - Yes please! My name is Swami Ghutghutananda. What!? - Ghutghutananda. My God! You got scared? Then listen, my master's name.. Was Tomrudhokkampittoananda. And his master's name was.. Ucchand Martand Kukurdimbaghajananad. And his master's name was.. I am gone! Immature minor! And How could I blame you all? When I heard the name of my master's fourth predecessor's name. I got constant hick ups for continues two days. Anyways! Leave all this. So dear ones, you are going to Ramgarh? - Yes! I am going to Muri, to reach Muri I guess it will be dawn. My children, actually I sleep very tight. So, I wished if you could wake me up! Off course.. Off course! We will wake you up. You don't worry, my sage. Okay.. okay - We will wake you.. we will. So then, should I go to sleep? Yes, go to sleep, it's already late in night. It's already late in night! How sweet words! Okay.. What is in it sir? In this!? It's a very harmful thing, son. Do you know Jogosorpo? Jogosorpo!? - Yes! Very poisonous snake. I have put it under the control of my mantras and kept it here. Now they eat bananas and drink milk. And they enchant the name of God. Snake enchants the name of God!? Yes! And not only snakes but Rhinoceros too. Everything is possible by the power of mantras. But you people do not come near it. It can bite you as you do not have the power of mantras. Beware! - Yes we will be very careful. Put it that side. - Good boys! Shall I keep it here then? Should I go to sleep now? Good! I remember, I was saying to let me.. Muri! - Muri, shall I sleep now? All hail the Lord! Who is snoring so much? My pack of biscuits! Jogosorpo! - Shut up stupid! Yes! Exactly what I thought. Its Navin sweet maker. - Jogosorpo! Take.. eat. No more? Oh no! Perhaps there was an ant, I ate it. Would it bite me inside the stomach? It could bite! - Let it bite.. let it bite. Once I had a rasgulla. Muri! Let it go. - You didn't sleep!? I slept, now I am awake. Then wake the sage up, the train has arrived Muri. After a while. Go see if the light has turned green. I will see. - Signal.. signal. It turned green now. - Turned!? Now to wake him. Sir.. Oh sir, In which compartment are you sleeping? Oh sir! Sir.. Sir.. Sir! - Who is it? Bhoja!? Yes! - Can you bring me some water? You could drink water later, the train is about to leave. Get down quickly! - Leave it, What!? I have been trying to wake you up since long, sir. The train is about to leave. - Look.. look.. look! Tell them to halt the train a little.. Tell to halt! Sage, Your pot of Jogosorpo! Jogosorpo! Idiot! Could you hear the singing birds, Kebla? Yes, and the sweet smelling flowers.. And the south wind. South wind!? I see! That's why I am feeling hungry. Oh my! And two plates of spiced potatoes.. At the station just a while ago! Huh! That's not enough for me. Yes! Oh I got it.. got it.. got it. Oh no! It's gone! Biscuit aha! Got it.. look brother.. got it. You know I forgot completely. Wow.. wow! Here Pela, you start. - I am not hungry. I will hit you! Take, hold it! Eat! You also take one. - For me!? For me!? You talk half. Don't ask for more. You won't get. I just forgot about the pack of biscuits. I think there are tigers in this forest. Scaring me of tigers! Scaring me of tigers! I heard even bears are here. What!? - I think, Tinnida there are even hippopotamus here. Don't try to be smart Pela! Do you think I am that foolish? Hippopotamus.. Does it live in forest!? Okay! But If there are ghosts? Gho.. gho.. Ghosts! Why should ghosts live here? There are no people around to scare! Why! We are here. But we should not be afraid because the ghost.. Will get our leader Tinnida first then us. Kebla! And what if Ghutghutananda comes to this jungle? Ah! Let him come, I will teach him such a lesson.. That he will become humble. "Ghut.. ghut.. ghut.. ghut.." "Ghut.. ghut.. ghut.. ghut.. - Ghutghutananda is coming." "Very good.. very good" "Spicy puffed rice, fried pulse." "Bread, biscuit" - "Feeling very hungry." "Mouth is watering." "Mouth is watering.. Mouth is watering." "Upheavals!" "Upheavals, troubles, bushes, upheavals." "Upheavals, troubles, bushes, upheavals." "Upheavals, troubles." "There comes the tiger to crack my shoulders." "Alas, alas it's the end of my life." "I don't know anything, I don't believe in tigers." "I don't know anything, I don't believe in tigers." "If it comes.." - "Near us." "If it comes near us, I will kick it." "It will turn into a frog by my skill." "White ghost!" - "Black ghosts!" "White ghost, black ghosts." "Ghost living on tree, Fish eating ghost." "Dwarf ghost, tall ghost." "Ghost.. ghost.. Ghost.. ghost.. ghost.. ghost" "Ghost will come and crack my shoulders." "Alas, alas it's the end of my life." "Oh leave it." "I don't know anything, I don't believe in ghosts." "I don't know anything, I don't believe in ghosts." "If we get.. To see him." "If we get to see him, I will break his leg." "It will turn into a frog by my skill." "It will turn into a frog by my skill." Isn't it Tinnida? - Yes! Tinnida! Tinnida! Oh Tinnida! Hey Tinnida! Tinnida! Who.. who.. who are you? - I am Jhonturam. Jhonturam!? - Yes, little master. I was coming to escort you, as master has written in the letter. If you were to come then why are you late? The train arrived so long ago. I was going to the station, Little master. I felt sleepy on the way, so I thought to take a small nap. I was sleeping.. sleeping, suddenly two mosquitoes entered my nostrils. Yes. I woke up and saw you all coming. So I came here, but this sir got scared and.. Stop you don't have to laugh so much! Those teeth of yours look as if radish. Tinnida! Oh Tinnida, wake up! He has come to escort us. Who.. why.. where.. when? It's Jhonturam, the gardener of uncle's bungalow! How was it? You will get, Bengali! You will get. So how did I act? Jhontu, did you realise I was acting? - No.. no See, he did not understand. I acted far better than a filmstar. We all know what lies in your destiny. What is it? Fine! - Come sir.. come. Let's go! This is my bed. Uncle said there are two rooms in the bungalow. We will stay in this room Kebla! - Come.. let's go. What happened? We will keep the door open in between the two rooms open. So Jhontu, what's in the menu? I will bring fish from the market tomorrow. Today there's chicken. Chicken!? Make it fast. Hey! I am going for a bath, you all do the same. Go.. go! What are you thinking mother? I told you so many times, let me also go with them. What would you have done there? What would have I done!? I would have stayed with them. Huh! What a brave daughter I have! Then you should have gone. I said so, your uncle did not agree. Then what's the use to think over it now? It would be as it is supposed to. What would be? - How could I know? It's a hunted bungalow with jungle all around. There can be tigers, bears, even snakes. There is no human locality near around. If some problem.. - Will you stop!? You can't do without uttering such ill fated words? What.. what are you two talking about? Uncle, you have done very wrong! - Why? Or what!? We can't eat or sleep in peace. All the while we keep thinking of Jhontipahar. Just look at mother. Oh I see! I was wondering what again! What's wrong? They have gone and will be back in a few days. You mothers pamper the boys so much.. That they do not grow up to be independent. They can't take a step without support. "Oh great mother of seven hundred thousand children!" "You just made them Bengali and not man enough" The old man with beard wrote these lines thinking of you people. But they are so young boys.. So far away from home. Young boys but boys after all! But how to control the heart? Then what to do? - You suggest. All right.. I will. You please don't add to her worries! Then you should have let me go with them. Yes, then everything would have been taken care of! So, mother what do you think they are doing there now? Do you see, Kebla how it's getting quiet. It will get more quiet, let it get dark. O my! So much! I will only take tea. - Why? I eat so much at lunch, my stomach is still full. All right, give me your plate. Tinnida! - Don't stop me, Kebla. Let me eat to my heart's content for some days. What will you serve for dinner? For dinner!? Chicken. Chicken, wow! Again chicken this time!? Look, make it fast. - All right.. all right. The water and air here make us hungry soon. As you were getting so late to bring this food.. I was feeling as to eat up the furniture. Okay, you leave now. - All right.. all right. Chicken, good! Jhonturam looks like a ghost but he cooks good. Looks like a ghost or is he a real ghost? There you are! So we are sitting and.. Eating food cooked by a ghost. Tinnida, I have heard that ghosts can take any form. Sometime they may be animals, may be shadow,.. May be human or even skeleton. What!? - Yes, it might be so that.. Some ghost has taken the form of Jhonturam. And now he is taking care of us.. Serving us food. What is it? - Look what we found! Where did you get it? - Under this bed. It sounds good! - Is it? Let me see. "India my Indian land, my motherland is my dream." "We are proud to be born in this land." "India my Indian land, my motherland is my dream." "We are proud to be born in this land." "You are full of greatness, decorated.. With snow clad mountains and green valleys." "The only match for you is yourself." "The only match for you is yourself." "There is no bound of your beauty." "If dark blinding night comes down from the sky.. We will walk hand in hand to bring a new dawn." "India my Indian land, my motherland is my dream." "We are proud to be born in this land." "Oh mother of strength! Give us strength.. Do away with our poverty and cowardice." "There is nothing to be afraid in dark nights." "There is nothing to be afraid in dark nights." "We will protect this big country." The great land of Ravindranath.. Vivekananda and The Brave Subhash." "We don't worry and think about,.. There is no trace of fear in our heart." there is no trace of fear in our heart." there is no trace of fear in our heart." Why are you standing there? - Listening your song. Then why are not coming inside? That's why I came here. - Idiot. Sir, dinner is ready. Ready? Okay, come on. Come on. Let's go. What is this noise!? Kebla! Hey Kebla! What happened? - Do you hear the noise? Noise!? Seems someone is walking around. Wait, I will see. Look at this! The stupid little mouse.. Got into the shoe. Look at this. And you got scared of the noise. Nonsense! What is a mouse!? Even if a big ghost comes.. What noise!? Ghost! - Let it be, but why should.. The ghost laugh like this? Where else should a ghost laugh if not in a haunted house? But should it make such an awesome noise in the middle of night!? Disturbing people out of their sleep! Look, Kebla don't try to be smart. Should a ghost laugh in a college room in the afternoon.. If not in the middle of night? That it should be, then we could give it a fight. Instead at midnight in the middle of the jungle.. It makes this haha sound. Tell me Pela why does the ghost laugh like this in such an awesome style? I don't know. Go and ask him if you are dare to! Yes let's go, let us see how he looks. Hey.. hey Kebla! Have you gone mad!? Why should I go mad? I think the ghost also fears the humans. Or else why can't we see ghosts in Kolkata? Why there's no trace of ghosts in daytime? And why doesn't it enters the house rather than doing hoho haha outside? Kebla, please shut up! I beg of you. Didn't you hear how it laughed? You may see two beheaded heads get in and start dancing around here! I have never seen such a dance ever. Okay! Here I count.. One.. two.. three. If the ghost is dare enough then let the heads start dancing on the count of three. One.. two.. three! You see!? I challenged but still the ghost did not dare. Let's do one thing. Tinnida and Habul must be awake. So let us all four.. - Kebla! you will surely die today. Let's go! - Kebla, brother listen to me! Go to sleep! - All right, you stay, I am going. Are you taking the lamp with you!? Or else how could I see in the dark? Wait, I will also come! You are absolutely.. Why! You said even if a big ghost comes.. I just said, didn't mean it. - Let's go. Where did they go!? The ghost made them disappear! It must be eating them up by now! Oh Habul! Shut up! Let me think. What to think now!? I won't stay here any longer, I will return home tomorrow. I won't stay here any longer, I will return home tomorrow. Hey Pela! Look at this! Look at Tinnida and Habul! Look! What, Tinnida! You are suppose to be the hero of Potaldanga! Is this your bravery!? Don't talk too much, Kebla! Habul and I had an idea. Isn't it, Habul? Yes, idea! - What idea? We.. planned that we will keep an eye.. If a ghost enters the room.. Enters the room.. Then both of us will seize his leg and pull it. And the ghost will fall flat on the floor. Hey why are you laughing? Stop I say! You! I won't stay here any longer, I will return home tomorrow. I believe in ghosts.. I won't stay here any longer, I will return home tomorrow. Hey I got you! Mother.. Oh mother. What happened? Why are you doing so? Get me a little water. Here! What happened to you? I had a bad dream. Kebla.. Listen.. call your uncle. Now!? - Do as I say. Uncle! Uncle! What happened? Mother woke up having a bad dream. She is calling you. But at this hour!? - I also said so. But mother said no, right now. All right, let's go, I will see. I explained so much but couldn't make you understand. Tell me what dream you had. I can't tell you all that! Kebla is so notorious.. If he does something!? Tell me why are you getting upset in vain? Even a mad person can understand self safety. If there happens a problem they themselves will return home. If something goes wrong before that!? When do you want to go, tell me? Uncle, I will also come! Yes why not!? Mother is going why not the daughter!? Let's go.. Even I want to see the four idols doing mischief. Peanuts!? Snacks. Cigarette? That's means.. I believe in ghosts.. I will return to Kolkata today itself. I believe in ghosts.. I believe in ghosts.. - Pela! Hey Pela! Where are they? - I don't see Kebla, Tinnida is here. Tinnida! Hey Tinnida! He is still unconscious. Tinnida! Who.. who is it!? Is this a joke!? Stop! Don' sprinkle any more. I will return to Kolkata today itself. What are you saying, Pela!? Yes, if I have to die I will die in Patoldanga. I am not willing to die here at the hands of a ghost. You are not very wrong, but here the food is so fine. The chicken and all.. - You stay with your chicken, I am leaving. No.. no listen, we all should discuss the matter.. I mean to have Kabla's opinion.. Where is Kabla? I am here. - How are you? - Fine. Well, listen! - You listen! Where did you go? I will tell you later, listen first. Not later, You say just now! Without informing anyone moving out on your own will.. Coming back on your own will. What do you think? Don't I.. have any responsibility!? Look, Tinnida don't try to show your leadership. It doesn't match you anymore after what all you did last night! What!? Insult! You insulted me. Yes I did! You proved your worth a lot. Now would you sit quietly and listen to me!? Habul, Pela, did you see? Kebla is.. Let it go, Tinnida! - How could I!? Don't I have self respect!? He will keep on insulting me and should I stay quiet!? I am Tenni Mukherjee of Patoldanga. I beat the horse at the big ground.. Would you listen to me!? Big ground and all! Insulting me!? All right! Listen.. last night when the skull.. Where did the skull go? Here! I will take this to Kolkata. Listen, when the skull fell in through the window.. I saw something very clear near the window. What!? - Yes! Then I had a doubt. I ran out but could not see anything. Then I walked through the jungle the whole night. Later I found this near the bush near the bungalow. Hey! We are not served breakfast yet! Take this. You should have brushed your teeth first! So what do you understand? - It got moistened. Oh Tinnida! - So you say! What do you understand? There's no ghost, actually it's human being. They want us to leave. - Why? That's what I don't understand. So you want to say it's not a ghost!? - No! They are scaring us acting as a ghost. Sure!? - Sure! Otherwise you say, where do these things come from? Have you ever heard ghosts smoke bidi? (cigarette) Ghosts eat fries? That' it! Now who can stop Tinni Mukherjee of Potoldanga!? They are human, I will teach them such a lesson.. Fine! Good! Good. Has Kebla gone mad? Is it mentioned somewhere.. That ghost doesn't smoke bidi!? - I have never read! "Oh! The crow dances on the roof." Tennida, Habul, Pela, come quickly and see here! "Oh! The crow dances on the roof." - Let's go! "Oh! The crane dances.." Look there! Do you see the stairs? Yes. - Then look carefully! Someone got up the stairs and heard us. Then laughed loudly before escaping from here. Kebla is right. Climbing these stairs.. But where did the man go so soon? There must be a hide out nearby. I doubted as I saw the bidi and peanuts in the jungle. We have to find out that hiding place. Are you ready? - What I mean to say.. I mean will it be right to go and face them upfront? All right, you don't have to go. We will go, come. No.. no I didn't mean that. I mean.. The day started a long while ago. So.. shouldn't we have breakfast and then go!? You can have the breakfast later, Tinnida! The bird will escape if we get late. Come. Come! Look! Bidi bids, teak leaves and peanuts. Now listen! We will go in two directions from here. The two of you that side and we two this side. Do you have a watch? - Here? All right Come back and report here after an hour. Clear? - Clear. Hey come on. Kebla has surely gone mad, or else.. Habul, I can't walk anymore. You go and see that side. I will sit here in shade. All right you sit. - You go. Oh God! I am so tired! Squirrel!? Isn't it Pela's voice!? - This way! Come. Pela, what happened? Why were you screaming? What happened? What happened? I was going ahead looking at the fruits on the trees. Suddenly I saw bunch of flowers on a bush. I went near and saw a tail of a squirrel hanging out. Fontada of Potoldanga has a pet squirrel, I thought I too will have one. Thinking so I grabbed the tail of the squirrel. Just then I got a tight slap. - The squirrel slapped you!? No a hand! This big! - Where did the hand come from? Yes a hand! Did I see anything else!? What do you mean!? A hand came down from the sky, slapped you and went away!? Yes, that's it! - Definitely an upset stomach! Weak fellow! Keeps on gobbling.. Eggs and meat, this is it's reaction. Don't talk rubbish, Tinnida! If not a slap.. Then why is my cheek still hurting? It happens when you have gas in your stomach. People get numb teeth, dizziness.. Buzzing ears but unlike you.. Why this happening? Why don't you believe me!? I.. Here! Here.. see I grabbed the tail of the squirrel. This has come along. Beard!? Tanned beard! What!? - Here it is sir. I told you to get a glass of milk for Pela. And you are showing me this boot! Shall I keep nibbling on it!? Shame.. shame, sir! The dog nibbles on boot not you. I was wondering where did sir Habul go? I couldn't find him. Searching for him.. I found this boot in the veranda. And a letter in it. Letter!? - Yes. That's right! Habul is.. What happened, Tinnida!? We have made Habul Sen to vanish. If you leave for Kolkata as soon as.. You read this letter, you will get him back safely. Otherwise we will make the three of you to vanish as well. And that will be forever. This is a warning in advance. That's all Ghachang Fu.' I will.. Leave this place today itself. What are you saying, Tinnida!? Yes, I don't to listen to anything. I don't want to listen to anything. We will see to it in Kolkata. You will leave Habul in trouble and go back to Kolkata!? But should I die in vain here!? Shame, Tinnida shame! You are supposed to be the hero of Potoldanga! And you will go back to Kolkata leaving Habul in trouble here!? Should I.. caring for Habul.. no.. no. I will not be here even for a moment. Not for a moment. Don't you feel ashamed!? Four of us came together. Don't you feel ashamed thinking.. About going back leaving one of us behind!? But.. should I - Hoe can you think so, Tinnida!? Nobody knows where and how is Habul! And you will run away like a thief.. Leaving him alone!? What will you tell everyone there!? How could you show your face to everyone!? All right You leave! Pela may also leave. But I won't leave! I will find out Habul and for it if I have to.. Kebla! - Don't you wish to get Habul back among us? Come let's go! Sir, your breakfast! - Later! Let Habul come, we will eat together. Come! Habul! - Habul! Habul! - Habul! I got the first one. The second one.. Got into the clutches itself. Now to trap the third and the forth one. That's it! What!? What!? What!? What will you do if you get us all four? Ghachang Fu (I will behead you) Then I will hang your heads on the tree. You thought all this is a joke? I tried to scare of ghosts, you didn't care! Your teeth will milk if I squeeze them! No! - What no!? My teeth doesn't milk if squeezed. I have appeared for Higher Secondary exam twice. Oh I see! Learned man! Okay tell me, what is the meaning of Cataktizum? Will you let me go if I tell you? Tell me first! Cataktizum!? Cataktizum means kitten. Your head! What is the capital of Henigemb? Honolulu.. no, Madagascar. Golgap.. What is the meaning of Geddeho? Gedde...! - What is the meaning of Itestesto? What is called oniketo? Onimesh is my maternal cousin! Maternal cousin!? Come to the cold cell, I will show you cousin. Come! Come.. come.. come. There's no use to see there. There's no way to escape. Your death is here. Come So then, Ghachng Fu's hide out is underground.. tunnel! Which way did I come!? This.. means here's is a road for vehicles. But which way did it go!? Let it go! I have to tell Kebla about Ghang Fu's hide out. About Gojeshwar. Habul is also there! Child! Greetings, Mr.! - Greetings, child! So, what are you doing here? I study in Hazribagh school, so I have come for picnic. Come for picnic, so far? It's not far! Where are the other boys of your group? They are somewhere around. So Mr. who are you? - I am Mr. Dhunduram. I have shop in Kolkata and a house in Raanchi. But why did you come to this jungle? I will take this jungle on lease. On lease. You will take it on lease, but why are.. You moving around without your men? Why.. why? Because there are bears in this jungle! What!? I will lease it, there are bears! Then I will have to think again. Child, does the bears bite people? Yes, They bite people as soon as they see one. Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God! Child, The bears bite the people.. But do not eat them up, do they? Yes, They eat people as soon as they see one. Good Lord! Eat as well! Hey Chaganlal! Let's run away! Eat as well! Oh my God! Let's run away! Let's go there.

We got tired looking for you and you went missing! Did I get missing on my own!? What!? I fell in Ghachang Fu's pit! - What!? Yes! I met Gojeshwar there. Habul is also held there. Are you serious!? - Or else what, am I telling lies!? Could you take us there? - Yes! Come let's go! - Gojeshwar wanted.. To put me in the cold cell as well. But a scorpion bit him and I ran away. Here.. this is the cow dung I stepped on. But where did the tunnel go!? It's surprising! Tunnel!? It ran away on seeing us. Yes, so it is! - That's enough, Pela! Don't lie anymore.. don't lie anymore! Tinnida! - I am not hurt! You two come down! Tinnida! Where's he!? Hey Tinnida! Hey, what are you looking for? For that scorpion. It's not safe, if it bites once.. But where's is Tinnida!? - Indeed! Tinnida! - Do not shout. Come this way! Which way!? Where are you!? I am on the first floor! - First floor mean!? You moron! Can' you see a ditch!? Come down! Where's Habul!? - Yes! What happened!? - Habul! Oh poor Habul! Leaving my Habul in danger, I was trying to escape. Habul! - Who is it!? Oh it's you.. I thought it's Bhojada! Hey Habul! - Oh don't disturb. Let me sleep a bit. I am feeling so lazy after having.. A pot full of rosogollas. (Bengali sweet) You hopeless fellow! We are so worried here. Getting restless searching for him. And he is sleeping nicely here after.. Having a pot full of rosogollas. Get up.. get up.. get up! Oh Tinnida, You spoiled my sleep. Where's Gojada? Sage!? I see such affection! Where's Gojada? Sage!? Are you kidding!? - Why? Why shouldn't be I be affectionate? I got such hospitality after coming here. I felt like I am at my maternal uncle's place. How did you come here? A man came to me and said, there's a hidden.. Treasure beneath this hill. Come with me if you want it. How could I leave such an opportunity? So I came here. How many of them were here? The sage, Gajadhar and a couple of others. What did they do here? They had something like a pan.. And used to print something with it. Hey! The pan isn't there! Did they take it away!? What did they print? - I couldn't say exactly! But something colourful.. Like pictures. Like pictures!? Colourful!? Beneath this hill!? In this tunnel!? Where.. did he go!? No, they didn't leave any evidence! - What evidence!? Evidence mean.. Let's go out. It's not safe to be here long. Not that way! There's a way out from this side. This way!? - Yes! This mean, we got into the tunnel from this side. And they escaped from that side. Come! Kebla! River! I see! The river turns from here and flows that way. Tinnida! Come quick! Kebla! Listen to me. They are gone so is the problem. Now let's go back to the bungalow. What's the need to chase them now!? They went towards Ramgarh. Kebla, listen, brother listen to me! Who's the coward among us? Tell me who is the coward? - No one! Then let's go and chase Mr. Dhunduram's car! What!? - Yes! Listen, Kebla have you gone mad? Ramgarh is 36 miles from here. Hardly one and a half hours.

Yes, with the help of these four. You know sir, I.. Kebla didn't return, isn't it? - No, not yet. I wanted to see all four of them together before going.
