He is here. What's with all the commotion this early? Oh, Hee-Soo. You made me crazy. Again? What's the problem? Damn it! We really miss you on yesterday's party. Take a look. Some bastard really has his eye on you. This is not the first time we are accused of plagiarism. Don't you get tired of it? Didn't you say the same old stuff tend to sell well? But not to this degree. So, are they going to sue us? Don't think they will... Also this is just a gossip. It's all good then. Making a mountain out of a molehill. You call this make a mountain out of molehill? What if they proceed with lawsuit? All the profits will be gone, what then? Less grumbling, more working. Hey, where are you going? Running away after making trouble. Hey, Hello. Yes, Hello Seong Boss. This is Hwang Pi-Di speaking from the music studio. Yes, are you well? I wanted to ask you. Last time you told me about that trainee Jessica. Yes yes yes I would like to meet her. OK, very good, OK. Look straight ahead. Very Good. Good. Excellent. Not bad. About to burst. She is very pretty. You pervert. I will kill you if you mess around with trainees. I don't have the looks... Don't have what? Filthy thing... I'll smack you. Don't touch my hair. Touched it, then what? Absolutely no messing around with her, understood? If you dare to even try, you are done. Good Great Great So pretty. Keep the change. What are you doing? Are you crazy? Ha-Ni. Wait a minute. Thank you. Have you guys finished? Or haven't finished? Finished, but... Then... -Eh -Tell me... Don't know, I moved my hand upwards that's all. Moved your hand up, and not even rubbing it? What a waste. Loser, should have just kill yourself. What if she push me? Girl will surely reject the first time. It's part of their instinct. But you can't let this small thing from stopping you. What if she break up with me? Then your hand must have already reached there. Even groping is not allowed, what kind of girlfriend is that? Think carefully what I said. You made me tired. I even need to teach you something like this. What would it feel like? Uh... Say hello to your boss. Hi boss For you to compose my debut song, feels like a dream come true. I am really honoured. I will work really hard, please instruct me. Of course you need to work hard. Work hard?! Everyone can work hard. But not many can do well. I will work very hard to do well. -Please give me lots of instruction. -Very well. Hey, why are you being so stuck up? Of course she need to do well. Let's forget all this. How about we listen to Jessica sing? Come here. The music is not bad. Good. Here, here, here. Why it stopped? Song sucks, forget it. We sang enough, let's have a drink. Come and drink. Hee-Soo where are you going? Hee-Soo. Hey That silly girl, really... How to make her sing now? Here's your Martini. Yes Long time no see. -When were you back? -How many weeks ago? -How's things recently? -Just as usual What would you like to drink? Anything is fine. Thank you Please enjoy. Your voice is too high. Who cut your uvula? Even the previous part sung terribly. Yes Good answer. Start over. You're here? What is she doing here? Uh... This... I... Hwang Pi-Di, has your ear gone deaf? Even autotune cannot save her voice. I know she can't do it, I know. But she is our last hope. You are making trouble again. What trouble... OK, stop, let's go out and discuss. Go. What is going on? That bastard sued us and took our money. You know well of my situation. How many times should I keep cleaning your mess? Forgive me, Hee-Soo. Just this time, just help me this one time. Then why did you pick someone who completely cannot sing? I know, I know. You don't know how things normally works in this rotten place. I know more than anyone here. Have you waited long? You're finally here. I simply know you'll be here by yourself. Jessica told me already. Jessica is not so bad. For a professional composer to actually say this. Do me a favor. Regular people listening won't be so picky. With autotune, we can earn profit to make a living. Can't we? Do you normally talk this much nonsense? Let's go, I'll help you clear your mind. Forget it. Don't be like this, come on, let's go. Let me help you compose a nice song, go! -I told you no. -Come on, let's go. Not too bad. I think it's great, do you feel inspired? I'll help you be inspired. Sorry. It's too cramped here, wait a moment. -Go away. -Just shift this a bit. I told you, go away! Hee-Soo, Hee-Soo. Hee-Soo, open the door! Hee-Soo. Welcome! -Give me a pack. -Show me your ID. OK 2700 won Here's your change. -Take Care. -Thanks. Isn't that the kid from the art school? Didn't I told you to go home? Am I home? So late already. How did you get here? You didn't change the password. You've become prettier. What are you doing here? Out of the house. Leave, now. I just come swaying by, but it seems your mood is not good. I am leaving. Let's clap together everyone. First time coming here? Uh? Yea... -Come with me. -We go there. Good, score. Shit, why today is like this? Jeez... Shoot. Jeez. Today is really my bad day. Do I play like Michael Jordan? Let's stop playing. What a loser. We just play a few rounds, let's continue. No, I am tired. Hey, every time is like this. Rarely win. Congrats! Loser! I feel like a pro today. I think I'll still give up on you. Whatever. What else? Art... There is not much remaining. Feels really boring recently. Are you mad? Once you enter college, it'll be fun. We are not making any progress. It's all good as long as you can graduate. It'll be fun in college, unlimited girls. Are you going to do it with girls after you enter college? Seung-Ho My goal is to travel the world and fuck all the girls. What did you have inside that stupid brain of yours? Shithead. Did you just hit me? One more time. Let's stop here. Let's just rest a bit. OK Drink some water Thank you. I feel much better now. My throat feels clearer now -Are you OK? -Just feel a bit tense. Let me help you. Turn over. I'm... I'm OK... It's Okay. Not doing any work, just sleep the whole day Your muscle is quite tense. -Thanks boss. -Is it still tense? What the fuck are they doing? -Is it painful? -Yes. Oh, you're here. That pervert has a dead wish. Hey I told you already not to touch her. Why don't you go and grab a coffee for me? -And you, Jessica. -Yes. Don't you want to continue practice? Sorry. I told her to practice a bit. I didn't sleep last time. I am so tired. How can you control your subordinate like this? I stayed overnight to manage them. You pick these people just to have fun right? How can it be fun? I'm just letting them practice by themselves. Alright I told her the work has started already. Didn't I tell you to sack her already? I did, but they keep coming back. They keep insisting. How can I reject them? It'll break their heart. Always think about money, then you'll be serious. -Where? -Not far from... Hee-Soo, you're here already. Coffee This pervert, want to die. Do it again and you'll be dead meat. His brain is just filled with filth. Fucking pervert. Why this coffee taste like this? Shithead, come back here! So hot Hey, I gave you 100 won. You don't even say thanks. Shut up, shithead. Holy shit, curves all in the right places. If only I can sleep with her. I'll do her 10 times in one night. I knew who she is. I also knew her. It's that composer with the scandal. Last time when I was smoking, she continously staring at me. -Seung-Ho -Eh? Even if she has nothing else to do, she won't look at you. -It's real. -Stop dreaming. We should get her autograph or photo-op together. Then I'll wrap my arms around her waist. -I don't want. -Let's go. No, what? Just come with me. You obviously wants it. Everyone, please look here. Today we have a guest lecturer A master composer, Miss Eun Hee-Soo Please welcome her. Hello everyone My name is Eun Hee-Soo I am honoured to be spending some time with you guys on this session. I believe you guys already heard my song "X-Feel". Very happy to meet you all. Eh... Sorry. Today, I would like to share with you guys. My personal secret of being a composer. Music to me is like energy which makes me move forward. Just like a time machine. How to express the world of the unknown? Or a completely new feelings? This is something a composer should consider first. Today, I would like to discuss. How I use music to go to the unknown world. Please wait a moment. Music creation. Always starts from that split emotion. That split moment... Feels like going for a climax. What? What is she doing? What? Why is she stripping? Wait. So even in our everyday normal life We should not miss that split-second emotion. Which will become the foundation of our creative work. Today's lecture... Today's lecture ends here. Is there any questions? Where are you running to? -What are you doing? -Huh? Lecture's over. Just come out already. -Liven up a little -Okay Come, quick. Excuse me, wait a moment please. Wait a moment. Are you going to lecture us again next time? At the moment, there is no plan. Oh... I am a fan of yours. Can you give my your autograph and phone number? What is your name? Please write, dearest Beom-Su Did you see? Your name? Seung-Ho. Ah... Seung-Ho. Hmm, how about the phone number? Asking for phone number is not appropriate. I thought so. Give me the paper. Thank you. Did you see that? I'm good. This is Beom-Su. Check me out. Learn from me. Do you really want to call her? Of course. What are you going to do if she picks up? You're such a coward. I will thank the God if she picks up. Why? She didn't pick up? I knew it. She said she has no plan. Gave me hope for nothing. Hello. Hello? Have you been studying well recently? Yesterday your tutor said you didn't attend the class. What if you fail? I can study by myself. Feel like eating anything? I am going to prepare for dinner. You just came back. Where are you going? I left something behind in class, be back soon. Silly boy... Really. You are here. Please enter. You really came. I thought you wouldn't come. Why did you hang up just after you called? Do you have anything to say? That is... I... I wanted to draw you teacher. Draw me? Why? Because you are very beautiful. Please sit first. -Want would you like to drink? -No need. Awww, Cold! I'll change a bit and come over. Do you want to play? I can't play piano. Like this? Now you try. What do you feel? It's okay, just tell me. Soft... and warm... Would you like to fondle it gently? You did it like you did last time. 10 out of 10 girls will reject you. -You saw? -Yep. You have a cute girlfriend. Your girlfriend? No! No... You can go. It's okay. I also have things to take care off. Okay then. Oh, 3057 My house password, next time you can enter directly. OK Like this? Now you try. Ha-Ni. Hello, what's up? What are you up to? Are you busy right now? No. What's the matter? What do you want to talk about? I am worried about you. I heard you didn't even attend class. I can study by myself. Studying by youself is... Enough! You just call me because you miss me. No, last time... I am hanging up. Seung-Ho, Seung-Ho. Dammit! You came early today. The fuck? Didn't you say you are not interested? That's why you're bad at drawing. Yeah. but I also said I am still thinking about it. But her face actually looks quite familiar. Is it that model we normally draw? Give it back. Did you do it with Ha-Ni? Idiot. You did, didn't you? I can see it in your eyes. -How does it feel? -It's not like that. I don't believe it. Did you do your research from porn? No. Shithead, just keep pretending. Why couldn't you tell me the truth? We are in here together, don't be so modest. Are you practicing abstinence?! No, right? Did you do it? Does it feel good? This sound. I have not done it. It's so obvious. If you didn't do it, then what did you do? If a woman invites a man to her place where she lives by herself. What does it mean? You fucking useless. Of course she is giving a sign to fuck her. Don't say, you won't go or at least touch her boobs. So, should I go? A man will of course go. Do we even need to talk about this? Have you never watch porn? Porn is different. Shut it. The most important aspect of being a man is strength and endurance. Bear this in mind. You're crazy. But, Is Ha-Ni's boobs suppose to be that big? This is a B-cup. For this one, let me see... This is way too big. You're crazy! Are you waiting for me? Didn't I gave you the password? Yes, but I just want to wait for you. Really? I really miss you. What are you doing? I thought you would like something like this. Are you OK? A woman need to be handled gently and softly, like this. Try it. This is how you kiss a woman. Let's stop here today. I'll get in touch with you later. Wait. Do you know what is my nickname? Hyena. Your breast is so sexy. -Quick, come here. -I'm coming. I also want this. What the fuck? Jerk. Is this your first time? For real? You're here already. Want a ride? Do you often meet your girlfriend? Not often. Lately, I only have you in my head. Are you disappointed? What's that? You don't say? Are you getting a cold-feet now? You didn't say anything on the road. Really? How can I be disappointed for just a trivial matter? The main course has just started. Since in the elevator, the smell of her perfume is making me so horny. Every night always imagining. What kind of woman is she? And after I met teacher, and back home. Her smell also lingers on my body. That time, I really want to meet her, embrace her. Even now, because I cannot resist her smell any longer. It's not fun if it's too fast. Is it done? This is really good. Boss, this song is really great! Be quiet, let the song finish before talking. Seung-Ho: Where are you? I miss you. Song's great! Hee-Soo, really appreciate your hard work. Oh? Oh... Why don't we go drink and celebrate? -OK -No, that's... Apologise, I will join next time. What? Why you always run away? How about we complete this song first, then we'll drink together. Ok, I'll be leaving then. OK, bye. Then how about three of us... Hee-Soo. I wanted to chat. How about next time. Why doesn't you pick up my call anymore? Did you get a new boyfriend? Who? Who is this man hiding from me? Do you ever treat me as your girlfriend? Eh? Don't be mistaken. Whether or not I will contact you, you'll just have to wait. Don't think too much about it. Do you really want it to be this way? If you are angry with me, just say it. I am not angry with you. Is it because I push you last time? It's not because I hate you doing that... I am just a bit scared that time. You're also wrong. What kind of person will suddenly do that. I don't have time to be angry about that. Then why? Why are you like this? Because your appearance makes me annoyed. What are you doing here? Drunk again! I want to see you. Go away! You looks much happier you know. Not because of you. I used to love you. Always happy to be beside you. But I've never been beside you. Always chasing you from behind. I'll leave then. I won't be coming back. Next week, I'll be going touring Europe. Why didn't you tell me earlier? Seoul has becoming boring now. Do you ever have me in your eyes? As long as it makes you happy, then you'll do it. Always consider me last... Why are you like this? It's really stressing me out. Hee-Soo. Now, even without me, you can still compose a great song. We also need to walk our own path. -Hey. -Yes. Your voice is not salvageable even with autotune. Sorry, let me try one more time. When are you going to complete the arrangement? Soon. Please be faster. No progress can be made if it's still incomplete Yesterday her boss came here and pissed at me. Just like gangster, scared me to death. His bodyguards looks like underworld criminals, keep threatening me. Hey, Eun Hee-Soo. Are you listening? Ah? Yes... When can you give me the arrangement? Hee-Soo. You seems tired today. What's the matter? What? You looks upset. Tell me what are you upset about? How can I undo a mistake? What mistake? Eun Hee-Soo. I am not upset with you. I will be really nice to you. I can be better than any other man you know. Just give me one more chance. The latest song I compose will really be successful this time. I am leaving. Talk to you later. Hee-Soo: Seung-Ho, where are you? I have something to talk to you. Call me. I'll wait for your call. What? That intern is showing stole our song? Fucking trash! How can he do this to me? Is this for real? The evidence are overwhelming. Fucking asshole. That is our song... How can it be stolen? Pi-Di, What about me? What about my debut? Please be quiet. I fucking annoyed right now. Hwang Pi-Di. There is a guest outside looking for you. A guest? If things keep going like this. We can simply use our lawyer to handle this matter. And your point is... We want to recover our money, and also the settle the matter with Jessica. The project has been stolen. How can you be like this? Boss, I still really want to sing Hee-Soo's song. Give me two weeks. How can you possibly produce a song in just two weeks? Don't bother to threaten us again next time. This way, the matter with Jessica will also be resolved. Stop it! Seung-Ho. Have you forgotten all the time we spend together? You told me not to see Ha-Ni anymore. Seung-Ho. You told me not to see Ha-Ni, but what did you do? Seung-Ho. Can you just hug me? What is kind of relationship is there between us? Teacher, I want to know your what is in your heart. That is a question that only can be asked when you are in love. Teacher, I love you. Don't you feel the same? These kind of love might make you suffer. Why don't you pick up your phone? You haven't been home for the past few days. Call me when you receive my message. Teacher, why don't you call me anymore? I will continue to wait for you. When you said about suffering, does it mean now? I really want to know what are you mean when you said it. I hope you are doing well. Teacher... What's up? Kang media wants to interview you. -Kang? -Yes Why? Still need to ask? Because your song is a huge success. Where? We are in... -Wait a bit. -Okay. Thank you, sir. I am in fact really happy. This time sales is really good. Hello? Hee-Soo. You come again today. Have you seen my message? Let's go. I already bought the tickets for that movie you wanted to see. What are we going to eat for lunch? Hey, Hee-Soo. Hey, Hee-Soo. -Hey -Oh, sorry, where is it? We are at Cheong-dam road, Deamun restaurant. Daemun restaurant? -Correct, hurry up. -OK, understood. The most recent, most popular debut. With only two weeks to roll out her debut, this must be somekind of super debut. Jessica's new song, please enjoy. Goodbye to My Romance. Is that me? Doesn't look like me at all. What? Why are you making that sound? That sound is just my reaction to you. Sound, reaction to me? No, please stop! Why not? I want to hear it again. -I am drawing -Okay. Wait a bit, okay. No!
