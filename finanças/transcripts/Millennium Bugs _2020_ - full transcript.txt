I mean, sorry, but you know, at least no dead grandparents. - That's true. - Where is it? - What movie are you looking for? - That's the thing. I don't know. Ah-ha. And I ain't talkin' about the band. - "Lost in Space," we have plenty of that. No one ever rents that. - Ta da! - Are you serious? What if someone rented that? What if Jefe found that? - Okay, first of all, no one ever rents this. Secondly, if they did, they'd get a great surprise, and C, your boss is never here.

(engine turning over) (techno Christmas music) (car beeping) We have a winner. - What the hell are you doing? We've gotta get out of here. - No we don't. Here's what we're gonna do. (keys jingling) - [Radio Announcer] 98.1. - Grab that car, drop it off a block away. I'll be there to pick you up. Then we're gonna come back, steal another car, take my car and the other car to a storage unit which I have incredibly close. I've rented two spaces there. We leave the two cars there, and this will remove any suspicion of just my car being stolen. We wait a bit and boom, everything will be just peachy. (crickets chirping) - Okay. - Just follow me. (upbeat rock music) - [Kelly] Hell yeah. Come on, come on, come on. Hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. Just park it there. See? We're all good. - I can't believe that worked. - I know. Let's go get your car and get a drink on me. You deserve it. (techno music) (toilet flush) (static) - [Miguel] I'm in a really good mood right now. - [Kelly] Wait, look at this. - [Miguel] This prick's headlining all the time now? - He's not a headliner, you're a headliner. - Effing right I am. (Kelly sighs) (bass guitar playing) - The bar is that way. - Nah, there's something I gotta do first. (head-bobbing music) - I love this! You got this, man. Take no dance. Take that mother out. - Get me a drink. Please. - I'll be back. - [Jim] Thank you, thank you for coming out. But more importantly, thank you for the $20 cover. My cocaine addiction lives another day. - Jack and coke coming in hot, Rogue Leader. - Hey, what, one more day until the world ends? It's perfect time to go get a loan. - Hah, I wish. Wait why does that sound familiar? - Because that's my joke. - [Jim] Y'know go out, spend. You have a car you want? Buy it! - Hey! That's my joke. - Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, give it up to Miguel, my only friend's an alcoholic, Cicero. (audience applauding) But seriously, how drunk are you guys right now? Have you seen these outfits? What's going on there? - Come on, you got this. - [Jim] So you think you're the only comedian telling Y2K jokes? - Just be original, man. You heard me say that joke yesterday. - You think I'd steal from you? You have one show on HBO and everyone comes after you. - Had! Past tense. - Yeah, that's right. You had a show on HBO. Let's give this man a big round of applause, huh? (audience applauds) - Oh shit, this is gonna be good. - Of course, it was the lowest-rated show on the network and it did get canceled after episode two. You never really talk about that part. - Well, at least I had one. - That's true, and you deserve props for that. But don't talk down to people. I'm not gonna sit here and try to rap battle you or out-joke you, that's too fucking cliche. - [Man In Audience] Face! (audience whooping, heckling) - Stop being such a dick, man. Look, I mean we get it. You had your 15 minutes of fame. You got your hot girl. I assume this is her from the Zima that she's drinking because Zima is for fucking douche bags. - Sounds like someone's jealous. (audience gasps) - [Man In Audience] No way! - Maybe I am. Maybe it's okay that I admit that. I mean, we all want something, right? Maybe it just infuriates me when dickheads like this get it. Oh, and your girl? She's super hot. And she seems very nice. But you do realize she's gonna leave you as soon as you stop booking gigs, right? - No. - Anyways, I've taken up enough of your time. Please get back to sucking your own dick. Please stop stealing my jokes. Oh, and by the way, this guy shit his pants in sixth grade. - [Man In Audience] That's fucking gross! - Sixth grade. Let that sink in. You're like 12 in sixth grade. - What are you even doing with your life? And I didn't shit myself. - I know how that feels. (audience applauding) (microphone feedback) (drum fill) - [MC] Heya! - How's that? - Amazing. - I approve. - Well, that's what matters. - Let's go get drinks at my house. - Deal. - Squinty, put it on my tab! That was badass. - I do feel like a badass. I could fucking take on anyone. (door pounding) - Hey! Where the hell you think you're going? - Oh, shit. - What, you think because I'm famous I can't kick your ass? Let's go, I thought Puerto Ricans loved to brawl. - Uh, I'm Mexican, and that's a stereotype. - What are you gonna do about it? - [Kelly] This. (punch) (rock tones) - Holy shit. - Pig. I like Puerto Ricans. - I'm Mexican. You know there's more places in the world than Puerto Rico that speak Spanish, right? - You know what I mean. (Jim farting) - [Miguel] He shit himself again. - [Kelly] No way, really? - You better jet, the cops are coming. But before you leave, can you pay your tab? - Five-oh! (upbeat music) (Squinty bangs on door) - [Kelly] Oh! - Let's go! - Calm down, the cops are not coming. (sirens blaring) Oh shit! - They're the cops! Woo! Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh I can't go home now. Let's celebrate. Let's crash a party, anything. - That a boy, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah! (tires squealing) (music stops) - [Miguel] What the hell. (swipe) - If we're gonna do this right, I need to ask you something. - Okay. - Have you ever done cocaine? (swipe) (upbeat music) (snorting) - [Kelly] Ugh! Let's get some booze! - Yeah!

I-I can't bring myself to destroy private property. - Just think about all the random dick she was slaying. Remember your birthday when she fucked a guy in your back yard, during the party? - That was a misunderstanding. - (stammers) But it pisses you off, right? - He was a really nice guy. We became friends. (bells tingling) - (party guy) I hate Sinead O'Conner. Lindsy, get out here. Some elf is gonna wreck your car. - Go go go go! (car tires screeching) - Yeah, that's right!

Oh, god, you smell like vomit. - Mama, no. Mama, I had a little too much to drink. Did I, did I get any mail? - I don't know. - Holy crap. He's wasted. Where you been? - I was hanging out with Kelly, what's the problem? - What do you mean, what's the problem? That girl needs help. She needs a friend. She doesn't need a drinking buddy. - Where is the mail? - Look at him, look at him. He can't even walk. - It came. I didn't get in. - I'm sorry. That-- - Why? No, no, no, why are you sorry? Huh? That means he's gonna go to school. He's gotta finish his masters. He can help out at the house for once in his life. - (scoffs) Come on, dad. What, I don't wanna do any of that. - What do you mean you're not gonna do any of that? - Excuse me? - [Miguel] I don't wanna go to school. I don't want to do any of that. I'm gonna be a comedian. (Dad speaks Spanish) - Yeah, dad, I wanna be, I wanna make people laugh, all right? And if it makes you feel better to call me a clown, that's fine, okay? I don't call you an (speaks Spanish) because you do construction. - Ah, Miguel! - What, mama? What, huh? Why can't I do what I love? - Because you're gonna fail Miguel. It's not that easy. You just don't go and become a comedian. Life doesn't work like that, Miguel. I busted my ass since I was 15, 16 years old, so I can give you a fucking life and you're gonna waste it. That's what you're gonna do. - Nobody asked you to do that, all right? - Ooh. - Excuse me? - Look, maybe you're right. - I am right. I am right. - Okay? Maybe, maybe. Maybe I'm gonna do it anyways. - Baby-- - He doesn't understand. He doesn't get it. He doesn't care. - Come, Arturo. (speaks Spanish) It's okay. (Mom speaks Spanish) (Dad speaks Spanish) (parents speak Spanish) (Miguel sighs) (water running) (dial tone blaring) (phone keys beeping) (phone ringing) - [Girl On Answering Machine] Hey, if you hear this, then... (answering machine beeps) - Hello. (emotional music) Are you there? Okay. I guess I'll just go for it then. I just needed to hear your voice, even if it was just to tell me to stop calling. (crackling) But I need you to know that I'm sorry. I need to know that you know. (light melancholy music) I'm a shitty person. I took advantage of you. It hurts. It hurts to dream about you and wake up alone. It hurts that I can't see your smile. And I can only hear you tell me you love me in my head. Some people are saying that the world's gonna end tomorrow. I'm okay with that. (sobs) (Kelly sniffs) I guess I better go. Sorry. I just, I needed someone to talk to. Bye.

Oh god no, it's too early for this. - It's 10:00 A.M. - Whatever. - You get a new car? - No, my friend lent it to me. (phone ringing) - Yellow, yup. Really? (laughs) That's great. Yeah, thank you, I'll let her know right now. Thank you. Great news. We got an offer, at asking price. You'll be out of debt, Kelly. Plus a little something more to start you off on the right foot. - Get off my lawn, now! Get off my property or I'm calling the police. - Kelly, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be insensitive, but this is a good thing. - Until this house is sold, it is mine. Now, get! (door slamming) (door alarm beeping) - Welcome to Vulcan Video. Dad? Look, uh, I am so sorry about last night. I, uh, this morning, I think, I was trying to say something. - Please. Where's uh, where's your boss? - He called earlier, he said he wasn't gonna be in until later. Why, what's up? - What you said this morning, how serious are you about it? - Like, 80%? Just joking, dad. Look, I know you're mad at me, and I know mom is mad at me. I, I think that if I could just explain it a little bit better-- - Stop. - I think that you would really-- - Stop. I want you out of the house by the end of the week. - Dad. - You can explain all you want. It doesn't change the fact that I think you're throwing your life away. It also means that all those sacrifices that your mother and I did for you are just being flushed down a toilet for a hobby.

Let's party like it's, it is, 1999. - [Miguel] What's the point? - I guess you're right, we're all gonna die anyway, right? Still, I think we should. You know, New Year's Eve traditions and all that shit. - I am feeling anything but traditional right now. How long till midnight? - Less than an hour, I think. - Wow. - Welp, if we're all gonna die tonight, might as well be while I am tipsy. - You're gonna drink again? - Do you have any Dr. Pepper? - [Miguel] No. - Bourbon it is. (Miguel sighs) What's wrong? I sense a disturbance in the force. - Stop. Do you think I'm funny? - [Kelly] What do you mean? - [Miguel] It's a simple question, yes or no. Wait, do you think I suck? - No! - My dad, my dad kicked me out of the house. I said I wanted to quit school and do comedy. - Holy shit, you got into the group! (Miguel sighs) Come on, I'm sure that-- - What? Hm? What? What were you gonna say? That it's all gonna work out? Hm? How? Please, enlighten me. 'Cause I feel like life is taking a huge, steaming shit on me right now. So please, tell me how. - Okay, I don't like this game. - It isn't a game, it's the truth. I am so fucking tired of being your little lackey. I'm tired of my parents thinking that I'm a joke. I am so tired of being in everyone's shadow, especially yours. - Why are you being this way? - We stole cars. We are felons, okay? Do you even know what people say about you behind your back? How is it that I'm your only friend? - I don't give a fuck what people think of me. - Oh, there it is. We can solve all the world's problems the Kelly way, in five seconds, by not giving a fuck. - Okay, look, I'm just trying to help. - You realize every time you're just trying to help, you inevitably make everything worse. You have to have realized that by now, right? Jesus Christ, I get what you're trying to do, but it doesn't fucking work that way, or maybe it does in your little tiny bubble, but for the rest of us, it's a big fucking zero! - Okay, you want me to shut up? All right, I'll shut up. Jesus. - There you go, drink up. - Hey, fuck you dude. Okay, you don't get to talk to me like this just 'cause your dad treats you like shit. It doesn't mean you get to talk to me this way. - Yeah, well someone needs to. You're always telling me to stand up for myself, right? You're always giving me advice. How about you take some fucking advice? - There. Done. Your turn. - Oh, my turn? I have a job. I have responsibilities. I went to college. - You work in a video store, okay? You still live with your parents. Grow some fucking balls. Take a risk. - Oh, it's easy to take risks when you have mommy and daddy's safety net, right? - You're trying to hurt me. Please don't. Not you. - Oh, look at that. You were sober for all of 30 seconds. Congratulations, we all knew you could do it. - Excuse me for wanting to feel good every now and then, okay? Or not feel anything at all. You wanna know why I drink? 'Cause I'm alone. - Oh, don't guilt trip me. - I'm not guilt tripping you. I'm being honest. - Okay, honest Abe, since you're being truthful, right? Did you steal Lindsy's car? Hm? What's that? No answer. Can you speak up a little bit? Huh? No quick come back? Bye. - I did it, okay? Are you happy? - I know that you did. You're not telling me anything I don't know. - I did it for you. - Oh, you did it for me? Well I haven't had a chance to thank you yet. - Yeah, I did it for you. She treated you like shit. She cheated on you. - I loved her! And you fucking cheated too, so you can't say shit. Why don't you fix your own fucked up life before you try fixing mine? - You know, just 'cause I don't talk about it, doesn't mean that I'm not fucking hurting, that I don't miss my parents, smelling my mom's perfume, Sunday Night Football with dad. Yeah, yeah, they left me money. That's it. - It was a lot of money. - You think that just 'cause I inherited some cash, that everything is hunky fucking dory. - [Miguel] Well, I'm sure it helped. - Well it's gone, okay? Does that make you feel better? I'm fucking broke. I'm in debt and I'm losing the house. This was all I had left. I lost the love of my life because I don't know how to do anything else. I didn't get a second and third and fourth chance like Lindsy did. - [Miguel] Don't bring Lindsy into this. - No, fuck you, okay? You want real? Here's real. Okay? I've ruined every relationship that I ever had. At least you get to know that it's not your fault. I don't get that. I get a ring and the option to leave a message that is never returned. Why do you need their fucking approval? - Because unlike you, I actually care about what my parents think, okay? I mean, you fucking hated your parents till the day they died. - Thanks. - Look, I shouldn't have said that, okay? I don't know what the last five years have been like for you. I'm sorry. (tires screeching) (car crashing) He's gone. - Yeah. So am I. (man shouts in Spanish) Miguel, you speak Spanish. What's he saying? - Uh, hey! Hey! (Miguel speaks Spanish) - What did you just say? - Hey, man. Look, I gotta call the cops. You ran into my building. You knocked the power out. - The end is nigh. The end is nigh. - Okay, take a chill pill there, Jim John. - Jesus, Jesus is, let her head. (gun shooting) - What was that? - Uh, let's go inside, yeah? (man shouts in Spanish) - Way ahead of you. (sirens blaring) (gun shooting) - Okay, the door is locked, we're safe in here. We can just settle down here. We can just chill here. The door is locked. We are safe in here. We can just wait things out. There's cold pizza. There's, there's beer. - Yeah, yeah. - We'll just wait it out. - Okay. (Miguel breathing heavily) - I'm sorry. I, I shouldn't have said that. - You don't have to apologize. You, you were just being honest. - No, I, (sighs) I was being a dick, and I do need to apologize for that, so, I'm sorry. - Okay, I think I just wanna be alone. I'll take this side. - Come on. You're my date for the apocalypse, right? (acoustic guitar music) - Hey, I just wanted to-- - Ugh, stop being so sentimental. I know. - I fucked up. - Yeah, you did. (guitar ends) But, I remember that you were the one who held me at the funeral. You were the one who came over and stayed the night when I was too afraid to be alone in that house. No matter how much shit Lindsy gave you for it. I pushed everyone away. You stayed. I was such a bitch to Nancy. To my mom. I blamed my dad for everything, just 'cause he-- - No, no you weren't. You weren't a bad daughter. Not a bad daughter. I mean, yeah a little immature sometimes, but at least you were honest. - Not really. - Yeah, yeah I mean you lied about pretty much everything. - Right? - Like literally, like everything. (Kelly laughs) Are you gonna go back to school? - No, no I don't think so. I don't really wanna be here anymore. I think we should move. - Move where? Where would we move? - I mean New York is too claustrophobic. - Cool bars, though. - Indeed. No, I was thinking more like LA? - Okay, I don't mean to be a dick about it, but you didn't get in, right? - No, I didn't. But thank you for reminding me about that. - Just making sure. - No, but I mean, I can always reapply. I mean I'm not just gonna quit because of one rejection. I mean, I don't know, there's really no point in staying around here anymore, is there?
