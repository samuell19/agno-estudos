It's a wonderful day, my love. Don't you say? Absolutely wonderful. Delightful. Sir, would you tell me that story, the one that I love so much. That would be delightful. The one about... the wonderful girl? The sweet girl. Well, she was pretty. No, she was absolutely beautiful. I sure wish you would get yourself together. All rise. Mr. Foreman, do you have a verdict? Yes, your honor, we do. What say you? In case number 9ZR3, the state of Louisiana versus Angelo Weathers for the charge of murder in the first degree, we find our defendant not guilty. Whoa! Yes! Order in the court! Good job, kid. No problem. Thank you. I knew you could get me off. They don't say you're the best for nothing. Just doing my job. It's okay, he's gonna get it. Sorry for your loss. You're no better of a man than he is. You liar. Carlie. I know this isn't right. But it feels like it. That was good... You all right? Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm all right, youngster, I got you. This is beautiful, isn't it? You know what, I've... I've been meaning to tell you something, you... You tried a wonderful case, I mean, the prosecution didn't stand a chance with you, brother. Thank you. Listen, you exposed the whole weakness of the indictment, just did... you did your thing, man. Oh, you know, I do what I do, man. Yeah, you do, you do. Straight up. Well, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. In about four or five months, we're about to add a new partner to the firm. Really? We ain't got to guess who that might be, now, do we? Well, whoever he is, I'm pretty sure he's a handsome guy. Yeah, a'ight... Yeah, a'ight. But I'll tell you what, now. I-I-I bet you 20 bucks he ain't gonna get a date with that new secretary before I do. Oh, now wait a minute, you playing yourself. Now you might as well pay $20 now... You old, dog, you old. Hey... What's wrong? There's nothing wrong, um... I just wanted to ask you, do you always feel... Do you always feel good when you win? Sometimes do you stop and think? You know what? It's not our job to think. It's our job to win. All right, see you at work Monday! Hmm. I told you that man was no good. Mom, please don't stick your nose in my marriage, okay. You already ruined yours. So please, give mine a chance. Baby... chance? That marriage didn't stand a chance from the minute you put that ring on your finger. Ooh. Mom, if you were being a mother to me right now, you would be... I don't know, giving me advice, supporting me instead of trying to tear me down. I failed as a parent. You did fail as a parent. You failed as my mother. You failed as a wife. 'Cause what you did to Daddy was not right, Theresa. I am your mother and you will respect me. And you will respect my marriage. What are you beating on my door for? Your son needs some money. Money? Yeah. What did I tell you about bringing these random dudes around my house. Oh, no, see what you're not gonna do is tell me how to raise my child. Your child. Yeah. Our child? No-no, you forfeited those rights when you left. And another thing? Baby, that is no random dude. He plays for the Pelicans, point guard. I don't care if he owns the whole team. Don't have him around my son, period, point blank. Get my son out of the car. All right. Come here, baby. Hey, man, hey, boy. Come on, man, I miss you, man. I'll be inside in a minute, okay? Just make sure my child's teeth are brushed when I come back to get him. And he uses those clean drawers I put in his bag. Great. Yeah. You finished? Do you wanna talk some more? No. Yeah, all right, yeah, okay, bye. All right, everybody, so... So those of you who have not met my new secretary, Miss Doreen, say hello. Hi. Anything you wanna say before we move on? No, thank you. Are you sure? Say hi to the people. Well, thank you for inviting me to your firm. All right. You're welcome. I know she welcome. All right, last but not least, I would like for you all to acknowledge our newest hot shot of the group. We all know who he is. Last two trials ended in acquittals. He has doubled his revenue in the last quarter. Ladies and gentlemen, put your hands together for our wonder boy, Terrance. Come on, give it up. Thank you. Yeah, that's good for this week, all right? See you all on Monday. Have a great weekend. All right? Thank you Miss Doreen, see you a little later. You're welcome. I would like my 20 bucks, dog. Ah, there you go. So you good? I'm okay. All right. You know, I wanna, um... I wanna share something with you. You remind me a lot of myself when I first got started. Yeah... Oh, no, no, I'm serious, you do. You got spark, kid. You got it, you do. Thank you. Man, I mean, you know how to select a jury, right? But... your gift is you can... you can communicate. I mean, the way you... You break things down so even the simple people can get it, you know? 'Cause God knows, that those juries are stands full of idiots, you know what I'm saying? You know that. And then, Terrance, the way... how you won this last Weather's case, I have no idea how you did it. You got me thinking you got a magic wand in your briefcase or something. Well, can I be honest with you? Always. I think he did it. Okay. Okay. Can I be honest with you? Please. I always think they did it. What's the point? See, the point is... Did they prove it? See our job is to make them prove it. You did a good job. Oh, um... listen, Terrance. I was gonna go this weekend over to the camp. Over in, um, Grand Isle with the kids? See you know what I'm thinking? I'm thinking that you could use some time for yourself. So I'm gonna email you the address and it's already paid for, room and board... listen to me now. I want you to go down to the camp. I want you to relax. And I want you to think about your future and your career. 'Cause when I said to you I was gonna open up the books and add a new partner to the firm. I was serious. Thanks, boss, but, I'm okay, no thanks. I wasn't offering as your friend. I was requesting as your boss. Yes, you're gonna go to the camp. And yes, you are going to relax, and yes, you're gonna come back here on Monday as a determined defense attorney. Save the world once you already get where you need to go but not a moment sooner. Oh, and Terrance, I know the family of the victim in the Weathers' case. They live down there, you say away from 'em. Of course. All right. Sometimes a man has to make a decision when he come to a fork in the road. Whether to go left or right. Either you be a man and stand up and make a decision, or you go nowhere. And nowhere, that's a dark place to be. Some people are placed in your lives only for a season. Sometimes at the end of that season, the flowers that God intended, blossom in your life. Long after a person is gone. The rules of the universe never changes. They have to blossom. Sometimes there's a voice inside you. You try to silence it. You try to squash it. But it pushs forward like the water behind a dam. And then it breaks through. Life has twists and turns. But in the end, no matter how many days you find yourself off course, you end up true north. No, he's not here yet. And I'm trying to get everything together. Listen, you are doing enough swinging for the both of us. Oh, girl, I think that's him. I'ma call you back, all right, bye. Uh. Hi. Hi, welcome to the Beachside Bed and Breakfast. I am so sorry. Thank you, thank you. Which way to my room? Uh, right this way. Welcome, this is it. Thank you, thank you. I can show you to your room. That would be great, I'm a little tired and exhausted. Do you want anything to drink, any coffee, anything? No, coffee will just keep me up, no, thank you. We don't want that. Nah. Okay, well, sign in and... Please. Sign the register. Wait, wait, please, I just wanna... I'm sorry. I just wanna relax and go to my room. Sure, of course, no problem. Come in, make yourself at home. I'm Sandra, by the way, Sandra Davis. Nice to meet you, Sandra Davis. I'm Terrance Mathis. Of course, nice to meet you, this way. Great. Right to your right. And my room. Yes, your room is straight ahead, you have the master room. Fresh towels in the bathroom. Okay. New soap. I would hope so. Of course, and let me know if you have any problems with the toilet. We had some complaints but we have worked really hard to make sure it's working properly. So we're good with the toilets. All good, I promise. Great, great. Yes. Uh, and dinner? Yes, dinner is served 6:30 sharp. Okay. Are you a vegetarian? No, just put it on a plate, I'll be fine. Awesome, okay. Well, I'll let you get settled. Let me know if you need anything, and, um, I'm here at your service. Thank you so much, you're so nice. You're welcome. All right. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Terrance, what's up, boy? How are you? Good. You good, I brought you something eat. Let me put that hot dog together for you, are you hungry? No? I slaved over the stove to make you a hot dog and you're not hungry? Nope. What you doing? Watching cartoons. Watching cartoons. Smile, boy, you ain't happy to see me? You see me in a minute, man. I miss you. Dad? Yeah. Can I ask you a question? Of course. Do you love Mommy? That's a big question for a little guy like you. You can tell the truth. Mommy says telling the truth is the best thing to do. Your mommy said that? Well, sometimes things are more complicated than they seem. What's complicated? Man, you have a million and one questions. Trust me, you'll know as you get older, all right? Can I have some candy? Some candy? Man, I just made you this hot dog and you gonna ask me for some candy, boy? You ain't getting no candy until you finish this hot dog, all right? I'm gonna go upstairs, man, and get some work done, all right? All right. I love you. I love you, too. Talk to you later. Ugh, my little man. 15 minutes. You got the money? Yeah, yeah, I got it. Put it down. 15 minutes... Yeah? Um, excuse me, sir? Yeah? Hi, I just wanted to let you know your dinner's ready and it'll taste a lot better if you eat when it's hot. Just give me a second, I'll be out in a minute, all right? Okay, sur... Oh, such a prick, ugh. I know you're gonna take me somewhere real nice tonight. I've been waiting. Can't we just go to the hotel and order food? All we ever do is go to the hotel. You're ashamed to be seen in public with me. Stop it. Listen, you know how it is, people taking pictures. I just want my business to be private. I understand that but I don't understand why you wouldn't wanna be seen with me on your arm? You know I'm proud. You just have to be patient, okay? Well, whatever. What time does that damn babysitter get here? Time to put that little rugrat to sleep. Unh-unh, do not call my child a rugrat. She'll be here in ten minutes. Good. Hey, Mom. Hey, baby. I hate kids. What? So it looks like we both have empty wine glasses. Oh my God, I am so sorry, um... I'm supposed to be attentive to you and I'm in here writing this poem. So you're a poet. Well, I used to write a lot, but, um, I haven't written since my father passed away last year. Wow, I'm sorry to hear that. Hey, you, um... You wanna come join me? No, I... I can't do that. Why not? Absolutely not, because it's against policy. Policy, I'm the only guest here. And you need to come and refill my glass up anyway. Now, yes, that I do need to do. I apologize. It's okay. My glass, I guess... I'm glad you like it. Listen, when you live the life of a bachelor, you savor every bite of a home-cooked meal. This right here was awesome. Thank you, you make me feel like I know how to cook and everything. Oh, to be honest, it was my best friend's recipe. But I did, you know, follow the steps, so you know, I can cook. That's the amazing thing about the world today. Um-hmm. You know? There's nothing you can't do. Information is everywhere. That is true. Yeah. Yes. So if you don't mind me asking... I mean, what's your story? How'd you get here, you know, making delicious dinners for strangers or whatnot? Well, actually, um, this was my dad's place and... You know, this was his dream. He built this with his bare hands. And I've been working here since I was a little girl so, you know, I felt like I needed to keep it going when he passed away. Wow. And I where every hole in the wall is. I know where ever nail is, every bad piece of plumbing, so... That's what it is. Wow. Yup. So you lived here in this small town your entire life? Well, yeah. Well, I went to Miami once for a youth conference, but that's basically it. That's it? Yeah. So the only time you've left this town was to... For a youth conference? Mmm, yup. Wow, there's a whole world out there. You don't travel at all? No, I mean, this was my dad's dream, and I felt like it was my job to keep his dream alive. I mean, that's noble of you, it is. I mean, but if you want my opinion, and you probably don't, but I've been known to give it anyway. I mean, this is your life to live. You ever thought about that? Yeah, I definitely did. I thought I was gonna be a big superstar poet like, I don't know, the next Nikki Giovanni or somebody. I can see that, that would be dope. Oh, wow. Seriously, you could be the next Maya Angelou. Oh, no, I could never... Maya Angelou, come on. Yeah. There would never be another Maya Angelou. What? You're talking crazy. Now God could put the same talent in you that he put in Maya Angelou. Don't doubt yourself. I guess. Well, since you like to ask so many questions, I mean, what brings you here having strangers cook for you? Well, I'm kind of here against my own will. What do you mean? What, are you on some vacation probation or something? Nah, nothing like that. I'm a defense attorney back in New Orleans and... my boss decided that I should come out here to clear my head. What's clogging your head? That's a good question. Just trying to figure it all out. Aren't we all. Wow, um... Thank you. That was good. All right. Mr. Angelo Weathers. How are you? Okay. I'm not gonna ask you whether you did it or not. Ethically, I'm not even supposed to. You wanna talk? We can talk. I didn't kill nobody. Are you saying that you never killed anybody? It's just me and you. Attorney/client privilege? Attorney/client privilege. I'm not saying I ain't never killed nobody. But I didn't kill anybody that night. Your father pays our firm a lot of money to defend you. And don't you forget it. I've got one rule. You lie... I walk. Listen, counselor, I didn't kill nobody that night. Okay. Let's see if we can get somewhere. 'Cause right now we're getting nowhere. Explain that. We were supposed to meet up. I never made the meet. I left my keys and ditched the meeting. Really? Yes, really. Don't you have a job to do? Your job... is to make this go away. That was cool, little magic trick. Unfortunately, I can't magically make that text message disappear, that is proof. Proof? This isn't proof. Beyond all reasonable doubt, proof? I got two words for you, counselor? Surveillance camera. Surveillance camera. Yes, surveillance cameras. Watch the tapes. They'll show me walk in the store. They'll show me walk out of the store. And it shows me coming back 15 minutes later. If I was here, I couldn't be here. It wasn't me. Oh my God, what are you doing? Hello? Have you burned that place down yet? Hello, Mom. There you go criticizing me as always, but for the record, no, I'm doing my job, as always. Hmm, well, I wish you would leave that place. You should let me sell it. We both could use the money. Mom, we've had this conversation a million times. No, we are not selling the place. And I'm gonna do whatever it takes to make sure it stays open. So is there anything else you wanna talk about? Yes, I found you somebody. Mom, stop. Look, you need somebody to help you get over that no-good guy. Where's my remote. Listen, just because you cheated on your husband until he drank himself to death, doesn't mean I'm gonna do the same to mine. Well... Just so you know, he didn't come in again last night, either. I'm sure you know that already. Exactly. Now this guy here, he is a cardiologist. He's a... he's a doctor, okay? He... he a heart doctor. Listen, whatever, he work on hearts. And maybe he can work on your heart. Thanks, Mom, but no thank you. Okay, I'm okay, and I'm definitely not taking relationship advice from you. As... as you wish, as you wish. Listen, he's a little young. Maybe I'll take him for myself. What... goodbye, Mom. Oh my God, crazy... I believe it's time for lunch. Would you like to have a sandwich? I want to hear more about the story. Finish the story. It's delightful. You mean... that wonderful story? That great story? You wouldn't believe what's gonna happen next. Look, I wanna fix this, okay? I wanna fix everything. The way I've been treating you. I should've never treated you like that. I'm young, I'm gonna make mistakes. But all I ask is that you give me one more chance. Sandra, let's go. Let's leave this place. Let's go pack up. We can go to California. We can go to Texas. Wherever, Jamaica, Paris. I just wanna go with you. You have nothing here, okay? Nothing. Look... Your father's gone, that's over. That place that you call work? A breakfast and bed? That's just a shack. You have a mother who doesn't care if you're dead or alive. You know what, I'm through with this! 110... that's 108, 124... Okay, it's gonna be on this side. 132. Miss Wiggins? That doesn't look like your vacation face. It's one of those days, you know? Well, I don't wanna overstep my boundaries but... you wanna talk about something? I'm here. Nah, it's just something I have to work out on my own. Well, you've definitely come to the right place. Stare at the waves. I just wonder where they coming from, you know? Sometimes I get answers to my toughest questions from those same waves. You know, that was kind of poetic. A little strange... Wow, okay, whatever. Poetic, nah, it's just... Have you ever done something and you knew in your heart it was wrong? But you did it anyway because it was your job? I can't say I've ever experienced that. But I'm here cooking you breakfast so I guess there's nothing wrong with that, right? Nah. There's definitely nothing wrong with that. I mean, there can be something wrong with that if that's not what's in your heart. I'm a good daughter. That's what's in my heart. Maybe he wanted better for you. Maybe you can still be a good daughter and... still do what's in your heart. Okay, no you're sounding like my mother. Ha... Just like her. You know what, that's not to okay so I'ma shut up right now, okay? Yeah. Straight up. My dad used to always tell me: "Integrity is courage." And I've definitely made some good and bad decisions in my life but... Nothing I've ever had to suffer from. Yeah. But living in a small town, you know, you do have your small town problems. You know what? I'll take these small town problems over the big city any day. Yeah, until you live in a small town. You won't be say that anymore. You know, I've always dreamed of going to Africa. Yeah. Wow. I think something like that would be really dope. Studying wild animals in a safari. Seems pure to me, you know? I mean, animals doing what they were created to do and nothing more. That sounds amazing. Look at you. A poet and a scientist, huh? That's a dangerous combination. I see you. I'm a go inside and get ready for, uh... Wash up and get ready for dinner. You do that because tonight, I am making my special salmon. It's gonna be awesome, so... Cool, well, thank you for talking to me. I really needed that. I'm a see you later at dinner, all right? Okay. Wish I could stay here forever. How many shots did we have? You know, I can't wait to get married one day. Maybe with you? Have some little kids. They would get your eyes, though. Housekeeping! Is it one of your friends? Sure, 'cause I know you're into some freaky stuff, that's all I'm saying. Be right back, all right? Bang, bang, bang. Look, we don't need housekeeping this late. We don't need no... Oh, baby, baby, baby, hold on, before you go in, I gotta masseuse in there. Baby, baby, I swear, it's not what it look like. I swear. I had too many drinks, I couldn't drive... I don't even know her. Hey, little man. Hey, I gotta head out early, I gotta get to the office. There's a big case this morning. Are you serious? You're gonna miss his first game, your son's first baseball game? It's his first game, he'll have more. You never come to any of my games! So I'll be at... Terrance. It's a weekend, Terrance, what lawyer works on a weekend? Could you support me, please? Could you support him? I am supporting my family, that's what I do. Could you help me... please? Could you help your son. You're so busy thinking about money and you're not here as his father. Money cannot buy him a father. You know what, I have to get to work. You take him to the game, you enjoy the game, okay? Fine, go. Thank you. That's right, show him your back like you always do. That's what he's used to seeing. Thank you, have a good day. Yeah, you too. 15 minutes. Let's think about that for a moment. Now I know two plus two is... four. I know the sky is blue, and I know that 15 minutes remains to be... 15 minutes. That's the amount of time it took my client to leave the coffee shop, make it back to the coffee shop on one foot. 15 minutes. Now I know it would've taken him at least 30 minutes to get to the place where Chris Wiggins was murdered. So how was that possible? Think about it. How was that possible? I know what you're thinking, I'm... You're thinking the last person who text him... who received the text from the victim was my client. I do admit that. Last person who did receive the text from the victim was my client. But he didn't meet with my client that night. He met with someone else. And God, God... God rest his soul because we all hurt from his loss. But you, each and every one of you have to decide... today. That this man is not a murderer. Now, he may have been a drug dealer. We're not here for that. He may have been a bad person. But that does not make him a murderer. Ladies and gentlemen, I want you to remember one thing. Think about this. 15 minutes. Just keep that in your head, 15... minutes. Would it make sense to you? This man is not a murderer. Thank you. Oh, hey, sir, you need anything? Coffee, tea? Two shots of vodka? Well, coffee sounds good. Tea sounds okay but... I really need a drink. Um, I'm definitely not supposed to drink on the job, but it's been one of those kind of days. Let's drink. Um-hmm. I mean, uh... Can you believe that I allowed this torture for five years. Five years. I mean... and then I lie to myself and I say, "It's happening, it's not happening." It's just... it's crazy. I guess it's just as much as my fault as his. Hmm. Wow... Well, I can't say I'm much better at judging character myself. Trust me, I'm not the one to talk. Come on, she's not that bad. At least you're not finding lipstick all over her clothes. If I would've found lipstick on her clothes, this right here would be a much better story. Okay, maybe that wasn't the best metaphor, but you know what I mean. What was that? You know what I mean. Nah, I know where you're coming from. Thank you. I mean, there were other guys. Hmm. I just turn the other way because I know I wasn't doing what I was supposed to. You know, I wasn't... I wasn't giving her the time she deserved so... I guess, I wasn't perfect either. What is that? Why... why can't you just be honest from the beginning and say that, just say this is what I want. This is what I don't want. This is what it is, this is what it isn't. I mean, it would be so much easier. I know, but life isn't that simple. It's not that simple, you know? Well, I guess I'm a country girl, and I think love is simple. You are a country girl. Okay, we know this. Nah, but seriously. I mean, I think you should have what you deserve. I mean, you don't have to settle. It's not like you're 400 pounds and unattractive. What... so what are you saying, fat people are gorgeous. They deserve love, what are you saying, they don't deserve love? No, I'm not saying that. I agree that fat people are gorgeous. It's not about fat people, it's just... Listen, you're not 400 pounds, okay? That is mean. Why should you have to settle? That's not right. Well, then I guess, just for me and for me, I am... a hopeless romantic. I'm a hopeless romantic and that's just what I'll be. So are you gonna take him back? I don't... I don't know. My heart tells me that I love him. But my mind tells me... I don't deserve this torture, you know, I mean... Right. And sometimes I put myself through things, one-two-three-four-five times. Just to make sure, and it's just crazy. Tell me about it. But at the end of the day, you just gotta pray about it and leave it to God. You do that. You know, my grandmother, she-she used to always tell me, "Never pay too much attention to what people say. "Watch what they do. They'll show you what's in their heart." You know? That's good advice. My dad used to always give me the best advice. Yeah? Oh, mean, he would... Knew exactly what to say, when to say it, how to say it, like at the right time. He was always perfect. You always talk about your dad. I'm pretty sure he was cool. I'm pretty sure his wisdom and knowledge is inside you. Just look deep down inside your heart, you'll find which way to go. To true north. To true north. Hmm. Oh. Wow. Ooh. Hmm, I needed that. Yeah. A little strong. Well, I guess I've been unprofessional enough for today. I'm gonna retire for the night. Okay. Thank you for listening. Any time. All right. I think I'm gonna hang on to this. Thank you. You have a good night. Good night. Did you finish the lawn mower yet? No, Mom, I'm working on it. Hi, I'm Terrance Mathis, I, um, came by to ask you a few questions about your your son. What on earth do you want to ask me? You helped the man that killed my son go free. I mean, he's free. Walking around. He gets to eat, he gets to smile. He gets to cry. He can feel the wind on his face. But not my son. My son will never be able to do any of that again. I know. Do you understand that? You're a filthy nothing. I don't know what else to tell you. Do you have children? I don't wanna bring my family into this... Do you have children? Yes, ma'am, I have a son. How do you look him in the eye and try to teach him to do what's right? And then turn around and do something like this for money? Ma'am, this is a nation of laws. You're a liar. You just don't know it. I have nothing more to say to you. Ma'am, I just wanna ask you a few questions, please. You've said enough, come on. You get out of here, man. Please, could I... All right, in this case about the freight lines, I want you to... to give them a call and set up an appointment. Thank you... set up an appointment for me for, um... sometime tomorrow. Okay. Hold on, one second,. Hey, hey, T, hold on, hold on. All right, make that call for me now, all right? All right, thank you Mr. Carvin. You sure looking nice today. Well, thank you. Yeah, you can call me, um, Carvin. Hey, hey, Carv. How are you enjoying your little getaway, man? What do you think? Well, it always relaxes me. I'm too young to vacation, man. All right, with the workload we got coming up, man, you're gonna need all the rest you can get. Listen, I've been going over this Angelo's case. And the more and more I look at it, it's... There's just something in my bones just telling me it isn't right. Terrance... Listen, man, the jury has already spoken. See, that is the beautiful thing about this country, right? We have what we call the rule of law. You did your job. Why are you torturing yourself, man? Let me tell you something. You have no idea how many clients I've had who I thought was potentially guilty. It's not my job to judge, okay? Terrance, it's not your job to judge. Man, you know what our job is, brother? Our job is to make sure the law is properly enforced. That's our job. You see, without us, there'd be no equilibrium, brother. There would be no one to fight for the common man. Listen, the government would have complete control. You know what we are? We are the equalizers. You understand what I'm saying to you, Terrance? Let me, let me, let me ask you this. Do you honestly think that the founding fathers of this country didn't believe that maybe once or twice, a guilty man might go free, hmm? But I'ma tell you this, I guarantee you, they'd rather have that happen, then have an innocent man spend the rest of his life in prison. Terrance... there is not shame in what we do, brother, okay? There is a need for people like us. Carvin, that's the same spiel they gave us in law school. We're talking about an 18-year-old kid. Terrance, would you like to stay another week? No, no, no, definitely not. Hey... I have worked long and hard to get you a shot at being partner in this law firm, do you understand what I'm saying to you? Do you honestly know how difficult it is for a black man to become a partner in a major law firm? You're gonna have to get your head together. You're gonna have to get your head together and you're gonna have to get it together now. Here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna come back in here on Monday morning, and you're gonna have your head straight. Do you understand what I am saying to you? This is it, we done talking about this. Yes, sir. Good. I am through with this! We don't need no... Baby, baby, baby, baby, hold on, before you go in, I got a masseuse in there. Come in. Excuse me, sir, I just... I wanted to apologize for earlier. Do you need anything? Can I get you anything? Nah, no, no, no, you don't have to apologize. You okay? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah, I'm fine. You sure, it looks like you've been crying. I'm not okay. Come here, come here. I'm not okay. What's wrong, come here. It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be okay, all right? You're strong, you're strong, you're strong. It's gonna be all right, okay? These nails are beautiful. Your skin... a little bit like that. Carlos, what the hell are you doing here? Shaletha, what are you doing here? Don't answer my question with a question. I asked you, what are you doing? Carlos, who is this chick? This chick? I'm the woman he's been dating for the past three months. And this chick is the one that's about to beat that ass if you say another word. Carlos, let me know when you're done with this. 'Cause I don't have time for it. Well, you need to find time to fix that crazy ass weave. Don't nobody wear horse hair no more, baby. Please, go Google some human hair, some Indian, some Remi, something. Trick. Hey, listen... Don't touch me. This how you operating now? This what we doing? What are you talking about? You're just like every other guy. What are you talking about? I never told you that you were the only one. What was all that talk about us starting a family? Honestly... I was just caught in a moment. I'm young. Handsome, got money. Right. Baby, I don't want a ready-made family. I just... Just wanna have some fun right now. I'm fun, that's what I am, I'm just fun. Don't get it wrong, you did have fun, too. Bye, Carlos. Bye. Shaletha. Shaletha! Oh, my goodness. I was supposed to get out of here today. Oh my God. Oh my God, I'm so sorry. What? This is so unprofessional. I'm gonna get your breakfast. Hey, stop, stop, stop, stop. Listen, hey, all of this, "sir," you can throw it out of the window, I mean... We slept together, okay? Well, I hope I was good. No, you weren't good, you were amazing. Rubbing on your shoulders all night. That was the best fun I had all year. Well, I gotta go. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I have a fork, please? Oh, right. Thank you, thank you. Mom, what are you doing? Mom... What are you doing? I'm getting old, Sandra, I'm getting old. What, not again, it's okay. Not again. What are you talking about? I traded all this... My husband, my child, my dreams. For this! For this! It's okay. Boss... What's that? I, uh, thought about your proposal and... I decline. You what? Yeah. I decline, sir. Terrance, Terrance, come on. You've got to think about this. You don't wanna do this. I've thought about it. Just not happening. Brother, this is a chance of a lifetime, Terrance. Here, take this back and sign it. I can't. Sign it now, Terrance! Boss, I... I thank you for everything you've done for me but... I'm done, okay? Thank you. Terrance? Thank you, boss. Terrance, don't... Don't... Terrance, don't do this! It's good stuff. Mr. Angelo. Still seeing you doing funny business. How are you? What can I do for you, counselor? Well... You took the streetcar. What? You took the streetcar. Well, the streetcar runs up Canal Street to Carondelet, correct? It would've taken you ten minutes to make it there back and forth. You took the streetcar. You can't prove it. Maybe I can. I figured you out. I do believe you're out of line, counselor. And I do believe that you're gonna have to answer to God for your actions. Not me. Not your rich dad. You. Are you done? I'd like to finish my cigarette in peace. Enjoy. Mr. Angelo. It's getting late. It's almost time to go back to the center. Did she ever finish writing that poem? You know, the one that she was writing at dinner that night? Of course she did. I kept it all these years. Can I hear it? I wanna thank you for inviting me over to talk to you. And I wanna let you know that I, uh, I absolutely feel terrible about being part of this tragedy. Usually I don't do this, but in this case, I feel that justice wasn't served. So I just wanna apologize to you personally. Now I do advise you, off the record, of course to file a civil suit immediately. You know, there's no amount of money that could bring my son back. I'll never get to see his big smile or watch him blow out his candles. Even graduate college, you know? No amount, you know that. Yes, ma'am, I do. And this boy, this killer, he gets to go free. I'm truly sorry. In all actuality, putting him in jail would only be a temporary gratification. I mean... I have unforgiveness in my heart. And only the Lord can heal that wound. But I'm relying that one day, I'll see my son again. And I wanna thank you for having the courage to come here and look me in the eyes and tell me the truth. Be okay. Right now it's amazing, I feel at peace. I'm out here in Africa. You should be here. We should plan a trip together, you know? Oh, man... I don't wanna... Oh, God. Hey, punk... This is for all the people that never got justice! Sandra? Baby? Now I know... I know I'm not the perfect person. But I'm your mother, and I love you. And you need me right now. I'm sorry that it had to take this for me to see myself. I've been a horrible mother. But I wanna change that, Sandra. I wanna change that. Let-let me take care of you. Let me help you. Let me take care of you, baby, let me help you. Okay? I'll be here for you. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Tell me, what happened next? Did they fall in love? Even a bullet couldn't stop this love. "Life is like a river, always flowing. "Every moment is a new beginning. "Every second was never promised. "Every breath is God's special gift. "Every blink remind us of the darkness. "Every heartbeat is an angel's footstep. "Every birth is a tiny miracle. "Every death is an untold secret. "Every lifetime is a special mission. "Every smile is a time for peace. "Every tear is a time to grow. "Every sin is a chance for forgiveness. "Every good deed is a chance to be complete. "We confront ourselves by always knowing "that life is like a river. Always flowing." That was wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. Sir... I can't remember. How did it end? That remains to be seen. I love you, Sandra, till the day I die. Sandra? Who's Sandra?
