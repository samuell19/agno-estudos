(soft upbeat music) (upbeat music) (doorbell ringing) - Can I help, you? - Hi, I hope I'm not disturbing you. - Yeah, actually, you are. - Oh, so this is what it looks like from the inside. They've been working on the renovation for weeks. Wow, a lovely job they've done on the kitchen. - Ben. - I did interrupt something. Terribly sorry. Lizelle James. I live across the street. - Jackie, and this is Ben. - Are you guys married? - No. - Not yet. - Well, no matter. We're so delighted the two of you have moved in. When you saw your car, I just couldn't wait to come over and welcome you to the complex. - That's very nice, but do you think we could talk later? - Oh, I'm sorry. You must think I'm just terrible to burst in. I'll leave right away. - We don't mean to be rude. We just have other things to do. - Don't worry. I understand. I just came to invite you to a little pool party over at our house tomorrow afternoon. You can meet all the neighbors. Everyone in the complex will be there. Well, I guess I should leave you two to finish up your business. (laughing awkwardly) - Nice meeting you. - Yes, well, all right, bye. - Bye. (door opening) - She's gone. - Ben, I'm not in the mood anymore. - Oh come on. - Listen, we ought to go to that party. We should meet our neighbors. - Yeah, mm-hm, great. - What am I gonna wear? - I don't know. - Ugh. - Do you think we're dressed too casually? - I don't think it really matters. - Ben, of course it matters. They're our neighbors. I wanna make sure they think we're up to standards. - It's a pool party. I'm sure all you need to do is wear your bikini. Besides, you look great. Don't worry about it. - Thanks, I'm a bit nervous. It was so very difficult to get into his Verdana Hills Complex. It's a good thing we had an in with the real estate guy. Don't you think it's cute that Lizelle thought that we were married? (laughing) - We live together. I mean, what's the difference, huh? - You know there's a difference. Anyway, let's just enjoy the party. I'm dying to meet the neighbors. (intercom beeping) - [Woman] Come in, everyone is at the pool. (upbeat pulsing music) - Wow. - They must have the hugest house in the complex. (upbeat pulsing music) (guests chattering) (upbeat pulsing music) - Ben, is it my imagination or are those people naked? - Where? - By the pool. - Nope, no clothes. - Oh, there you are. Everyone is just dying to meet you. (guests chattering) This is Lorenzo, my husband. - Very nice to meet you. It's Jackie, isn't it? - Yes, it is. - Welcome to the community. I hope you enjoy Verdana Hills. We certainly do. - Well, with your warm welcome, I'm sure we will. - Where's your husband? - Oh, boyfriend, not husband yet. - I'm sure he will be. Where is he? - Well, he should be around. (upbeat pulsing music) There he is. Ben? Ben? Come here. This is Lorenzo, Lizelle's husband. - Nice to meet you. - It's a pleasure to meet you. - Jackie, I want you to meet some people. This is Helen. Helen lives in Number 28, by herself. Helen's in charge of business affairs. And she's the toughest lady I've ever met. - Welcome to Verdana Hills. - Thank you. - And this is Bill. Bill, here, is married to Gloria over there. (upbeat pulsing music) What a beauty. We're all jealous of Bill here, because he's made gazillions with his internet software. He's the only one with a house bigger than us. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks, it's nice meeting you both. - So, Ben, may I offer you something to drink? - Yeah, sure. - Lizelle and I like our parties to have an open atmosphere, if you understand my meaning. - Thank you. Good stuff. - Yes, gets better all the time. (upbeat music) So, um, do you know them? - Of course, they're my guests. - And you don't mind? - Mind? Of course not. Ben, we're an open-minded community here, very open-minded. Normally, we don't ask new residents to our private parties but Lizelle really liked you two. You must have made quite an impression on her. - Well, we just met her briefly. - Yeah, she really liked you. Ben, are you an adventurous man? - Yeah, I like to think that I am. - Well then, we have a game here in Verdana Hills. Only a chosen few get to play it. We thought you might like to join in. - Really? What is it? - Elixir of women. Wet, clinging bodies. These hot summer days are so sensual. Do you ever wonder what might happen if there were no taboos, if all the prohibitions and restrictions of society were lifted? If you could sleep with any woman at any given time. - Well now that would be paradise, wouldn't it? But then, what would the women say? - Exactly. But here, the women all know. In a few hours, all the players of a little game called Swap will sit around a card table and pick a card. Sometimes the women go first, sometimes the men go first. The woman that picks the ace of hearts will go off into the night with the lucky fellow who also picks the ace of hearts. And so on. - Are you serious? - Dead serious. No guilt, no recriminations. Instead, experimentation, pleasure. Think of the potential, huh? Think of the new heights of sensation you can reach. If you want to play, that is. We're inviting you and Jackie. - You are serious. - I never joke about sex. I'll let you think about it. Talk it over with Jackie. We'll be in the game room after 10 o'clock tonight. (upbeat pulsing music) - You have got to be kidding me, Ben. - Jackie, you're overreacting. It's just a game. - Ben, that's crazy. That's just an excuse for Lorenzo to fool around with all the other ladies. - It's just a game where consenting adults are experimenting. I mean, what's wrong with that? Everybody gets bored with their wife or husband. - What do you mean? We're not even married. Are you bored with me already? - No, that's not what I mean. - Then what do you mean? Did you see what was going on at the party? - Yeah, I saw, but I thought it was great. Two mature people enjoying themselves. - And you don't think that's a little weird? - No, it's an open-minded community. I mean, they invited us to join them. - Lizelle. - What about Lizelle? - She was eyeing you at the party all night. It's a scheme of theirs. - Oh, God, you're being ridiculous. It's a game, it's just a simple game where people are experimenting with new things. Nobody's gonna make you do anything that you don't wanna do. - Ben, I don't wanna talk about this anymore. (clock ticking) - Never mind. - You were looking at the clock. - No, I didn't look at the clock. I mean, you said you didn't wanna go. I respect that. Just forget about it. Look, why don't I get some champagne, and we'll just have a nice, quiet evening at home, okay? (sighing) (tennis balls bouncing) - Hey, Ben. Wait up. Hey, Ben, haven't seen you around in a while. - Yeah, I been busy, you know. - Yeah, market is rather hot at the moment, isn't it? - Yeah, it's okay. - So, Jackie said no? - What do you think? - They always say no at first. What are they gonna say, eh? Great, fantastic? Too embarrassing. I'm sure she'll warm up to the idea. - Well, you're a lot more optimistic than I am. - Hey trust me. She'll change her mind. - That is great. Great. Okay, we'll see you this Sunday. Uh-huh, bye. Hey, Sexy. - Who was that? - My girlfriend Beth. - Beth? What's Beth up to on Sunday? - She's getting married. - You gotta be kidding me. - Can you believe it? Suddenly she calls me outta the blue, she's met some guy, he's crazy about her. He wanted to take her to Vegas and do it right then and there. - It's not a bad idea, no overhead. - Ben. Anyway, she convinced him to have a quick hotel wedding, which her mother was delighted to arrange. - Well good for Beth. - Well, she wants us to come to Vegas so that we can have a double wedding. - Over my dead body. - Which part? Our wedding or her wedding? - No, her wedding of course. I mean, you know I don't get along with Beth. - I see. So, does this mean you'll go with me on Sunday? - I'll go if you go. - Are you sure? I know how much you hate weddings. - I've been to weddings before, okay. Look, I'm gonna go work out. I'll talk to you later. - Bye. - Bye. (upbeat electronic music) - Lose something? - Damn, you scared me. Thanks. - Yeah, I found it in the gym last night. - Yeah, I was checking out the workout room. - I thought I saw you there. - You may have. Well, thanks. - Hey, listen, wait. Would you mind giving me a ride home? - Sure, hop in. - Thanks. (engine starting) - So, we haven't properly met. I'm Gloria Camden. And you, you must be the Ben that everybody's talking about. - (chuckles) I didn't know everybody was talking about me. It's nice to meet you. So, um. - Yes? - Uh, does, does your husband Bill know what you were doing the other night? - Of course he does. He was there when I picked my card. - Really? - Yeah, but he wasn't quite as lucky. He got Helen. - Helen? What's wrong with Helen? Helen's an attractive woman. - Yes, but Helen tends to be a little aggressive. And she scares a lot of men off. - (chuckles) You guys are really something. You know that? (laughing) - It's a great moment, isn't it? Nobody else around us. - Hey, look. - Oh come on, Ben. You know you wanna play the game. Probably more than anybody else. In fact, most of us wish you would play the game. All the girls are talking about you, you know. Jogging, working out every morning. God, I can only imagine the body you're hiding underneath these clothes. It's a shame, though, you know. Jackie's got you all to herself. (engine idling) My husband wouldn't like it too much if he saw us out here. But you know, if it was swap night, all those rules would go right out the window. And we could do anything we want. So if I pick the ace of hearts, will you pick it too? It's next week. Don't forget. (birds singing) - Hello, Jackie, do you mind if I join you? - No, of course not, please. - Would you mind rubbing some lotion on my back? - Uh, sure. - Mm, that's nice. Could you get my lower back too? I always seem to miss that spot. - Here? - Yeah, just a little lower. Oh yeah, there. Mm. - That good enough? - Fantastic, thank you. God, it's a great day for margaritas. Would you like one? - Yeah, sounds great, but who's gonna deliver? (phone beeping) - Carmen, would you mind telling the housekeeper to bring over a couple of margaritas? Actually, you know what, why don't you make that a pitcher? Thank you. (phone beeping) It's on its way. - Great (chuckles). - So I told him, I said, Look, if you're really serious, you better put that ring on my finger and quit throttling that other guy's neck all the time. - Maybe that's a good idea. I mean, nothing else seems to be working. - Yeah, well, you know how I keep Bill in check? It's hard to keep the passion going in a marriage year after year after year. - That's what I hear. - Well, we play the game Swap. - You do? Wow, that sounds a little perverted to me. - Why? You don't have to do anything. I mean, I pick a card, Bill picks the card, and when I come home, Bill still knows that I'm the only woman in the world for him. - And he doesn't mind that you've just had sex with someone else? - You don't have to have sex. I mean, you can do whatever you want. You can walk, you can talk, you can play Monopoly, or for all I care you can sit and watch TV all night. Besides, it might be a real good way to get Ben's attention. - So, you think the swap will make Ben jealous? - I'm certain of it. Besides, what harm could having a little pleasure bring. Relax. Like I said, what harm could having a little pleasure bring? Like I said, what harm could having a little pleasure bring? (upbeat music) ♪ Another day ♪ Waits for me outside that door ♪ ♪ All the same questions So I wonder if that would have made Ben jealous. - I don't know. I think Ben still has some wild oats to sow. - Well then the swap is perfect, and he'll realize just how wonderful you are when he starts seeing other women. - I don't know about that. I'll have to think about it. - Don't think about it too long. I bet if you make Ben really jealous, you'll have that ring on your finger before you know it. - Hm. Maybe I'll have to try that. - They're having another swap on Friday. Lizelle will call you with all the details, okay? - Okay (chuckles). - Mm, so Lizelle called today. - She did? - She invited us to her house party tomorrow. - Really? - I thought maybe we should go. - You wanna go? Is it gonna be like the last party? - I think so. - So, you changed your mind? - Well, I know how badly you wanted to participate last time. - I didn't if you didn't. - No, I just thought about what you said, and it wouldn't hurt to give it a try. - Don't just do it because of me. - No, I'm not. I just thought, why not? Might be kind of fun to experiment. (chuckling) (guests chattering) (soft music) - As you all know, this game has rules, very strict rules. That's what allows us to enjoy the game to its fullest. Whatever happens here tonight stays with us. Tomorrow morning, no one is allowed to ask questions about tonight, and no one is obligated to say anything, unless of course they want to. Here are the two sets of cards. No exchanging cards allowed. The swap is up tomorrow morning at dawn. If it doesn't happen by then, it doesn't happen at all. And we have a new couple here tonight. Ben, and Jackie. Since this is Ben and Jackie's first time, let's go over the rules again. The master bedroom is forbidden. We like knowing there's at least one place no one else has occupied. Two, no one outside this group is allowed to join in. Darling, you've counted these. Okay. How about ladies first? - Great. I'll get the ball rolling. Here you are. - Now, gentlemen. The ace of clubs. - Ace of diamonds, hm. - Um, here. - That's Josh, Helen's gardener. She always brings him with her. - Ace of hearts. - Ace of spades. - I was hoping I'd get you. Come on. You know, I love it in here. It's so, sensuous. So surreal. Don't you think? (upbeat music) - So, where should we go? - I'm not sure. How about a bar down the road? - A bar? - Or a diner. It doesn't matter to me. - I'm sorry. I don't mean to make this awkward. This is just new to me. So, what should we do? - I don't know. We could just walk for a bit. - Sounds good. It's a beautiful night. (crickets chirping) (door opening) - Oh. Well, it looks like somebody else found my secret place. I guess we'll have to go somewhere else. - Why don't you join us? There's plenty of room. - And what do you think about that, Ben? - Oh, your classmates must have been shocked when you walked in with Gloria on your arm. - Oh, they were. They all recognized her from her modeling days. You know, they used to call me geek. They couldn't believe it when I walked in with Gloria. And Mike, the captain of the football team who used to punch me out every day after school just for the hell of it, and when I saw him, he was bald with a big old beer gut. And his wife was, shall we say, on the plump side. He even asked me for a job. That was a sweet night. - Well that must have made you feel good. Did you give him a job? - I'm not that nice. I remember one time I had to fly out to Paris. Now there's a beautiful city. Have you ever been there? - Mm-mm. (phone ringing) - I'm sorry. I'll just be a minute. Hello. Marty, is anything wrong? The meeting went fine. They're just going over the contract. Marty, Marty, just sit tight, okay. I'm sure we'll have an answer soon. Now, I have to go. I'll call you in the morning. Right. - Wow, sounds like you have an exciting job. To be able to travel to all those places, must be wonderful. - Yeah, it's great, but it can be pretty intense. I just got back from New York, putting the finishing touches on a pretty big job. And we're just waiting on a contract, waiting on a signature really. (sighing) Barring any sudden catastrophe. - Well, sounds like you've got it covered. I'm sure it'll be fine. (crickets chirping) - You know, you're a really great lady. How come you haven't gotten hitched to some nice guy? (laughing) - I have a nice guy. I'm just waiting for him to pop the question. - He's a fool if he doesn't soon. - Thank you. (soft music) So, here we are. - You know, I'm glad I picked your card. I had fun tonight. - Me too. It was nice. - Yeah, you know, sometimes talking can be so much better than-- - Yeah, it's really hard to find decent conversation these days. - Ben's a lucky guy. - Well, good night. Or rather, should I say, good morning? - Good night and good morning. Sleep tight. - Okay. (crickets chirping) (soft guitar music) - Good morning. - Morning. Boy, am I tired. - How about some coffee? - Yeah, that'd be great. That hit the spot. - So how was your night last night? - Jackie, you know you're not supposed to ask me questions. Remember the deal, huh? - So I can't even ask you how your night was? - No. I see you had quite a late evening last night. You weren't here when I got in. Hope you had fun. - It wasn't like that at all. - Hey, look, I'm not asking a question, okay. I'm just stating a fact. You weren't in our bed when I fell asleep last night. - Bill is a very nice guy. - I didn't say he wasn't. - He's very rich too. He was telling me all about his company last night. He's going public this month. - Are you trying to make me jealous? - No, of course not. - Can you hand me some of the paper? - Ben, it wasn't like that. We just walked and talked all night. He was a perfect gentleman. He didn't try a thing. It's a good thing he didn't, because I don't know what I would have done if he did. - Oh you didn't do anything? Wait wait wait, don't say anything. I'm not supposed to ask you any questions, right? - No, we just talked. Happy? - Why would I be happy, huh? I mean it was your night, your choice. I hope you had fun. - Ben, do you love me? - Of course I do. - Then let's not continue with this swap thing. - Not this again. You just told me you had fun last night. - I don't think our relationship will last if we continue. The temptations are too great. - Don't worry about it. I mean, what harm could it do? (tennis ball bouncing) - Man, that groundstroke of yours has really come along. - I warned you, didn't I? - The way you were playing, I coach, man. - Hey, look who's here. - [Ben] Good afternoon, gentlemen. - Hey, it's good to see that last night hasn't affected your fitness regime, huh? - Absolutely not. I feel like a million bucks. I could run a marathon. - I'm glad to see that you're getting into the swing of the game. I knew you were the right couple to ask. - Oh yes, we sure are. And I would like to thank you two gentlemen for allowing me to participate in the activities last evening. - The more the merrier. There'll be more of course. We'll keep you posted about the next party. - I'd appreciate it. Absolutely. - You have an amazing girl there, Ben. - Oh, that's right. You got to spend some time with her. - Now, Ben, remember the rules. No questions allowed. - I'm not asking a question. But, Bill, no offense, but you're not Jackie's type. - What is that supposed to mean? - Come on now, Ben. - It means that I'm not gonna lose any sleep wondering what you and Jackie did last night. You're a big shot, Bill, you got a little money to throw around, but to be quite honest with you, Jackie likes her man to be a man's man, if you know what I mean. - What the hell you trying to say? - All right, hotshot, cool your jets. - It was millionaire Bill here who started saying things about Jackie. - I was just paying you a compliment, asshole. - Hey, look, I don't need any compliments about Jackie from you, all right. If I were you, I'd be wondering why my wife wants to get down everybody's pants but my own. - What the hell's your problem, buddy? - All right, hotshot, get out of here. - What? - Get out of here. Go and cool off. - Asshole. (crickets chirping) (dog barking) - Gloria. Hey, Gloria, wait up. Where you been for the past two weeks? I haven't seen you anywhere. - Listen, Ben, if you can't play by the rules, do us all a big favor and don't play the game at all, okay? - What? - You are such an amateur. - Hey take it easy, buddy. You're gonna give yourself a heart attack. - Hey, how's it going? - Fine. Helen thinks I'm getting a little too soft from doing her gardens. - Oh, so she sent you to the gym to pump up? - Nah, I'm just putting you on (laughs). I love to work out. Gotta stay fit in my line of work. Great facility here, too. One of the benefits of working here. - So are you and Helen um? - What? - Are you guys a couple? - No way. - What's the matter? She's a beautiful woman. - I didn't say she wasn't, but she's not my type. A little too aggressive for me. I mean, she's a real control freak. - Well you two came to the party together last night. - Well who else was she gonna bring, her grandmother? - True. Hey, have you seen Gloria lately because I just ran into her outside, and she gave me the cold shoulder. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, I haven't seen her. Let me tell you something, though. Couple weeks ago, I saw her having this huge argument with her husband, and they were like, breaking glasses and shouting all kinds of profanities at each other. - Really? - Yeah, didn't look too good. I mean, but they're always like that. The next week, we see them again, they're smiling, they're all happy. She's always like that. - Oh. - So you gonna play again? - Play what? The game? - [Josh] Yeah. - Yeah, sure, why not? - Well, between you and me, I think the game is rigged. - You're kidding? - No. Lorenzo and Lizelle, they seem to always know what all the cards are. They always get new kids on the block. In fact, surprised that Lorenzo didn't pluck your girlfriend that night. But then again, they probably didn't wanna make it too obvious if they both picked the new meat. What would be good for me is if we all got to pick our own partner. That would be good, because then we could change our cards. Which would be even greater because then I would never get Helen. And that would be great, because then I would never have to spend a whole night with her. She's a little too domineering for my taste. But you're still fair game, buddy. - Mm. (soft music) - Hey, that looks great. Did you buy that for me? - No, actually, I bought it for tonight. - Oh. - What time's it start? - 10 PM, promptly. - What happens if we're late? - Why, you having second thoughts? - No, why, are you? - No, I just thought I'd ask if you were, that's all. - Well, I'm not. - Well, good. - Good. - All right then, well, hurry up and get ready so we're not late. - Okay. One sec. Just wanna put on some perfume. Well, what are you doing? - What am I doing? I'm gonna put on some cologne. (upbeat music) (guests chattering) (pool balls colliding) - Honey. They're not coming. - I know. (upbeat music) Remember that the master bedroom is forbidden and the swap is up at dawn. Some of you seem to have forgotten that last time. (guests laughing) - Oh, hi. - Hey, hello. - Hi. - Hi. - Just in time. I think gentlemen first. - Oh, I'll go first. - It's good to see such enthusiasm, Ben. (upbeat music) Ben, we only have until dawn. (laughing) (upbeat music) Ace of diamonds. (soft music) - Who's next? - Ace of spades. (soft music) (phone ringing) - Couldn't you have blocked it? (phone ringing) - Hello. Marty, what's wrong? What do you mean they wanna pull out? They want an emergency meeting tomorrow? Okay, okay, I'll grab a flight right now. Get Tracy to put me on the last flight to New York. Yeah, right. I'm sorry. Small catastrophe. Fly to New York tonight. I'm sorry. I'll call you later. Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. - Now what are we gonna do? We have an extra woman. - Well, since I'm the one causing the problem, I don't mind offering the solution. I'll just add myself to one of the couples at the end. Does anyone mind? - Any objections? (soft music) - No, not at all. - Well then, let's continue. - Ace of diamonds. - Ace of hearts. Well, what do you know? That's me. Now, if all the men can give me back their cards. Gloria, is this really what you want? - Absolutely. (soft music) Hm. Ace of hearts. (soft music) - I guess you'll be joining us then. - Hold on a second. - Yes, Ben. - I just find it rather odd that the last two cards drawn were the same. - Well that's the luck of the draw, my friend. I don't see anybody else complaining. All right, everyone, good night and disperse. Let the games begin. (soft music) - Excuse me. (soft music) I just wanna make sure you're okay. I know how you feel about Lorenzo. - Don't worry, I'll be fine. Besides, this is what we wanted, wasn't it? - Is Mr. Enthusiasm getting cold feet? - Just ignore him. - Take it easy, huh? I'm just asking for the house keys. (soft music) - Well I've never been in this room while it was so empty. - It's a great room to play in. - Yes, why don't we play a game? - Hm, what game can we play with three people? - How about nine-ball? Is that okay with you, Jackie? - I don't know how to play. - I will teach you. - Mm. - This is a nice place you got here. - Yes, it is a nice place. I've worked hard to earn it. Okay, Ben, now you're boring me. See, I really like to play rough. But hey, if you're not interested, just don't waste my time. - Sorry, Helen, my mind's just on something else. - Something or someone? (soft music) Boys like you don't know anything about sex anyway. Everybody thinks that screwing Gloria is the best thing that could happen to their sex lives. And I have seen so many of you suckers fall for her. But you know what? She's always gonna go back to her husband. - You mean Bill and his millions? - You're all fools. She loves him. - But how could she? - In her own way, she does. Now it's Lorenzo who's the one to watch out for. And he particularly likes to break in the innocent types. It's kind of his hobby. He broke up the last couple that lived in your house. The wife became completely obsessed with him. - Oh my God, Jackie. He picked Jackie tonight. Oh God, what have I done? Look, Helen, I've gotta go, okay. (scoffing) - Jackie? - [Jackie] Let's not continue with the swap, Ben. - [Helen] He particularly likes to break in the innocent types. He broke up the last couple that lived in your house. The wife became completely obsessed with him. (mysterious music) - Jackie? (mysterious music) Hello? Hello? Jackie, thank God, I've been looking for you everywhere. - You have? - Yeah, I was worried about you. Are you okay? - I'm fine, Ben. Did you have a good night? - No, I've been worried about you. - You were, why? - Well, Helen told me some really bad stuff about Lorenzo. - Really, like what? - Just some really bad stuff. Did you sleep with him? - Ben, you're not supposed to be asking me that. - I'll bet that slut Gloria did. - What's the matter? - Nothing. It's just, I've been running around looking for you all over the place, and I hear these voices everywhere. I just realized that I loved you. And that I'd be stupid to give you up to another man. Look, Jackie, I'm in love with you. Let's go get married. - When? - Tomorrow, let's go to Vegas. - Ben, that's silly. - You're right, you're right. You deserve better than that. Look, we'll, we'll call my parents tomorrow and then we'll go pick out a ring for you and we can get married next month. There's just something I need to know. - What? - I just need the truth. Did you have sex tonight? - I did not have sex with Lorenzo tonight. - Good, I was kinda worried about that.
