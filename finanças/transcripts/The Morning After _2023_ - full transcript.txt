Hi, Benji. Guess you're not hung-over, huh? Who's a good boy? You wanna go outside? Yeah? Come on. Hey, you. Do you want some coffee? We only have instant, but... Do you want some toast? I found this necklace in the hallway. Any idea who owns it? That's mine. Really? I don't remember you wearing it. Let me. Now, this is the mess that actually needs to be cleaned. When will your dads be home? Not until Monday. So we have the whole house for the weekend. If you want to hang out? I'm gonna go find some pants. Ew, guys. Gross. Can you believe, I found this in the laundry room? And that's not the worst thing. I found a used condom in my bedroom. Can't believe some man has been spreading his man spunk all over my sheets. I have to boil them or burn them. Can only be half as bad as your dads' sheets. You mean from last night? No. From whenever they do it. There's two of them. Ew, I cannot believe you just talked about my dads having sex. All parents are asexual. I thought you were in favor of diverse sexualities? I am. LGBTQ+ every letter in the alphabet except P for parents. Because no one wants to think of that. Especially when talking about... Jizz? I have to find a way to make you stop talking. Do you think it was Patrick and Melanie? I made you some in case you got hungry. - Why was Patrick here? - Huh? Patrick. Why was he here? Well, it's kind of hard not to invite him. We have a lot of the same friends. So you invited him? Just a part of the general invite to the usual suspects. I didn't think he'd actually show up. I just thought it was going to be the most tactful way to handle the situation. Did you invite Melanie too? Oh, my God. Fucking Melanie. Who even pronounces it like that? No, of course not. Here. Eat some before it gets cold. We should get some light in. See how bad the damage is. Fucking hell. You assholes scared the shit out of me. Who are they? I don't know, but they can fuck off. Hello. Good morning, Jo. Did you sleep well? Who is this? I am the Big Gay Bunny. I appear to all the little lesbian girls after they had their first taste of the sapphic fruit. Fuck off. Not your first taste, obviously. We meant Sophie. I want to hear what they're saying. Trust me, you don't. Don't pick up. Sophie. Good morning, Sophie. I hope your hangover isn't too severe. How would you know about that? I followed your party on Instagram. Who are you? As I told Jo already, I'm the Big Gay Bunny. I'm here to welcome you to Lesbian Land. Patrick. Friends of his? What do you want? We are here to fuck feminism. Last night, one of our brothers cried out for help. You thought you could just replace him. But we're here to show you that men can't be replaced. Now let us in, before I ask the Big Bad Wolf to blow your house down. But that's a bear mask. Sophie call the cops. I'll get the door. Are you calling the police? Where's Benji? We're at nineteen Willamore Drive. There are two men in masks outside threatening us. No, they haven't broken in. We've locked all the doors and windows. They're just outside. Send help quickly. They're sending a police car now. The cops are on their way, asshole. How nice. If I were you, I would hop on back to momma's basement. But since I do hope you end up in jail, maybe you should just stay right there. Actually, I think we'll just wait for the police out front. Are they gone? Look, I know there's a lot of assholes out there, who hate people that are different. It happened to me online. But I promise, I'll protect you, okay? Any Internet trolls ever do anything to you in real life? No, but... They've been getting more aggressive. Fuck, I wish I hadn't let Benji out. Why is the bathroom locked? - Can it be locked from the outside? - No. Is someone in there? Who's in the bathroom? Fuck. Who's in there? Is that a bread knife? What the hell are you doing in there? Sorry, I must've passed out. Hope my male body doesn't offend you dykes. What offends us... ...is this. Well, you two were the ones making out in public. It's a bit too late to demand privacy now. - Where did you post it? - I don't even fucking remember writing that shit, man. Do you know what you've done? We have two freaks in masks outside right now, threatening us. - What? - They're the ones who sent us this post. - Friends of yours? - Slow down, man. Who the fuck is outside? Two guys in masks. A wolf and a rabbit. - We've called the police. - A rabbit? Fucking... Fuck. What? My phone's gone. And my keys. Those are not our biggest problems right now. Well, it's pretty clear, you ladies don't need me for anything. So I'm just going to go get my stuff and get out of here. You can't leave with those guys still out there. It's just two teenagers playing a fucking prank. Calm down. Jesus, this place is a fucking mess. Can one of you guys call my phone? You don't just get to walk away from the problem you created. I need some aspirin. Medicine cupboard. Top left corner. Nice. Where the fuck are my keys at? Looks like I missed the real party. This one yours or your dads'? Would you please take the situation a bit more seriously? Look, Jo. Nobody wants out of here faster than me, okay? So here's the deal: I'm gonna go find my keys, and then tell those two kids to fuck off, as I go to my car and find some coffee. Then you can stay here and put on your dads' gimp costume, and fantasize about having some real balls. Charming. You know me. Sweet. Would you please look at your phone? Tell us where you posted it and who responded. - Fine. - Thank you. What is it? Well, it's like this forum for guys to complain about women. You know, like their exes or girls rejected them. It's just shit talking. You posted this on an incel hangout? Look, it's just a place for shit posting. It doesn't mean anything. 'Oh, I just doxed some girls to some incels. Man, how was I supposed to know something would happen?' Did anyone respond? Just the usual bullshit, man. Like, if there's a video of you two guys doing it, some comments about who is hotter. - You want to hear 'em? - Fuck you. Look, it's just the usual shit, man. Doesn't mean any... Wait, this one's a bit weird: 'Time has come for our dicks to stand up to the lesbian gynocracy.' - Who wrote that? - The Big Gay Bunny. That's him. Well, he is probably harmless. Yes, and they probably just showed up here to be harmless in person. Look, everybody always talks tough on those forums. Nobody ever does anything in real life. You have no idea, none, what women have to go through every day. Especially those of us who are gay or trans. Assholes like you running around, ruining lives, and then accuse us of getting hysterical. - So I'm responsible for this shit? - Yes. Yes, you are. - Guys? - What? Hear that? Can't make out what's happening. Are those two the guys? Yeah, the police are talking to them Should we go out? Well, I need my keys. Fuck your keys. Let's wait. I hope the cops arrest them. For what? Wearing masks? I'm gonna go get my keys now. I think we should leave with the police. Wait. They have to come check on us. They're still talking. - I wish one of the cops was female. - Why? Because I'd feel a lot better, if one of them was a woman. Wouldn't you? You've got to let go of that pretty straight white girl privilege, you know? Look, something's happening. Are they getting handcuffed? I can't make anything out through this glass. See, they're holding their hands out. No, they're shaking hands. What the fuck? - Are they leaving? - The cops are. Shit. They're just getting in their car. We need to go. Now. What are you doing? Those guys are still out there. We need to get in that police car. Stop. Would you? Oh shit. Look, it's going. What just happened? I don't know. Why would they just drive off like that? Don't answer it. Patrick. - Hello? - Patrick. - Your brothers have heard your cry, and have come to help. - Hang up. How did you get this number? You three have got to stop asking such predictable questions. This is worse than a Tinder date. Patrick, hang up. Yeah, well, I don't remember swiping right on you. So you can just fuck off, man. I'm curious. What hurts more? The crick in your neck from sleeping on the bathroom tiles, or the ass fucking those two dykes gave your masculinity? Who the fuck is this guy, man? Turn around. Benji! Who's a good boy? You are. You know why you're a good boy? Because you let this lesbian cut your balls off. Because you weren't always such a good boy. I bet you used to be the big swinging dick of this whole neighborhood. Maybe you fucked one too many bitches. Am I right, buddy? But she couldn't stand all that testosterone, all that virile power. No. She called it toxic masculinity. She told everyone it was a problem. That you needed to be fixed. Fucking hell. So she took your big manly balls and went... ...snip. Breaks my heart to see you like this, man. Just a little pet doggy. Sit, boy. Roll over. Now beg forgiveness for your male privilege. Leave him alone, you sick bastard. I'm calling the cops. Again? They're going to get pretty annoyed with you. You're threatening to kill my dog. So? That is illegal. So is driving a car into a crowd of protesters. So is marching through the night with torches, shouting, 'Jews will not replace us.' So is storming the Congress to try and overturn an election. You know what we learn from this? - That you're fucking nuts. - That you're a fascist wannabe? I'm sorry, Jo. I couldn't hear that over the sound of your pathetic crying. I said, I will fucking kill you, if you touch my dog. No, you won't. You liberals are full of shit. You say, 'defund the police', 'cops are racist pigs'. But then when you're in danger, suddenly it's all, 'Where's the police?' You think these honest, hardworking men in blue want you tweeting videos of the excessive violence, they have to use to defend you? It's their job to defend the people. No. it's their job to defend order. But that order has collapsed. You killed it. So go ahead and call whoever you want. Wave your placards, create a hashtag. We'll see if anyone comes to help you. - Oh, shit. - No. Why would you do that? Because it amuses me... ...to torture a dog. You sick fuck. I'm paraphrasing from Reservoir Dogs, you moron. Yeah, well I'm gonna get medieval on your ass. That's a different Tarantino film, you idiot. Jo, don't. What do you want? It would be irresponsible of us to give Patrick his keys back, if he is over the limit. So first, we need him to stand on one leg and touch his nose. Super. Now all you have to do is fuck Jo, and we're good. What? You emasculated Patrick by fucking his girl. The only way for him to earn the return of his balls, is by fucking you back. You're sick. No. You're the one who is unwell, Patrick. You've allowed your mind to be infected with the disease of liberalism. It makes you want to be a good ally to feminists and gays and people of color. So this lesbian, eats your girlfriend's pussy, while you try to rub some life into a cold hotdog in the bathroom. The first step in being a man, is admitting you're not okay with that. Our bodies, our choice. What you call a choice is an insult to nature. Your body evolved to get fucked by men. You're biologically wired to love dick. But this virus of liberal feminism has fucked up your programing. Have you ever felt the pleasure of a rock hard penis inside of you, Jo? Don't make me puke. Well, here's the deal. We will all leave peacefully, once Patrick fucks Jo, the way nature intended. Why? Because, when Jo feels dick inside of her for the first time, she's going to realize that feminism has lied to her. And our boy, Patrick. Well, nothing makes you more of a man than converting a lesbian. Any man who can do that, has truly earned his penis. And what did you do to earn your miserable prick? We don't want you to end up like this poor little doggy, Patrick. That's why we're here. To save your balls. So you're not coming out, until you restore your manhood. Don't let those two dykes mock you. Better dead than castrated. Jesus. Be a man. Hey, I know. But there will be time for this later. Okay? Okay? Sorry about Benji. Fuck you. This is your fault. I didn't fucking ask for this, Jo. We don't have time for this. Jo, call the police again. Tell them to come to the house this time. Patrick, call your football buddies. Tell them to bring baseball bats. I'll post across social media. Tell everyone where we are and what's going on. Yes. Yes. I'm sure it's the same fucking house. Can you please send a female officer? You cannot just send the same useless fucks as you did the last time. How am I supposed to stay calm when you won't fucking help me? Jo, stop yelling. Sorry. Yes, I will wait for the officers. Just please send help quickly. I know you're upset, but it's no good shouting at them, okay? It's just always the same fucking thing. You tell the police that some internet trolls are threatening to rape you, and they just say, 'Oh, don't be so sensitive.' But they're coming back, right? Yes. But what if they don't help us again? Then we shout, 'Fire'. That's what they teach you in rape prevention class. Do you want to call your dads? What's the point? They're on a beach in Malta. I'd just worry them to death. You should see Bastian when he panics. He's such a drama queen. I can just picture him swinging his arms up and down on the beach. while Greg tries to stop him from hyperventilating. Are you wearing my clothes? If I have to run for my life, I'm not doing it in a cocktail dress and fuck me shoes. Did you come in here this morning? Just with Patrick, when he was looking for his phone. This is a serious violation of the Bro Code, dude. Dude, why don't you just call the cops? We did already. Then what the fuck's the problem, man? Because the fucking cops came and didn't do shit. You really think I would be calling you, if this wasn't a fucking emergency? Get Jeff and some of the other guys, and bring some fucking baseball bats. - What? - Hang up. I don't know, man. Jeff is really hung over. I don't even have my baseball bat anymore, because I loaned it to Chad, and the fucker never gave it back. Well, any kind of fucking stick to hit people with, man. It doesn't matter. These guys have got to run the moment you get out of the truck. - What? - Hang up. Why the fuck are we even arguing about this, man? Round up the posse and get over here now. I've got to go. Bye. What? I was literally in the middle of calling the fucking cavalry. I think there's another person in the house. What? I think someone was watching me in the bathroom just now. Then I remembered, the office door was closed when I got up, but it was open when you found your phone. Must be because I could hear it ringing. None of us opened it. What the fuck? Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Who the fuck was that, man? Let's make sure everything's locked. Jo, check the windows in your bedroom. - Patrick, check the office. - Yeah. I'll check the bathroom. All locked. We're good. We are not fucking good. They were inside my home. Isn't anyone coming? A lot of people have seen my posts. They... You have got to be shitting me. Fucking asshole is mocking us, man. The fuck? All right, that's it. I'm calling fucking everyone. Fire brigade, ambulance, taxis, Pepe's pizza. It's time to shout 'fire'. Fire! How's the hangover? A lot better. You wouldn't believe the emotional support we're getting on social media. Worth a lot less than the Bro Code, I imagine. Nope. They're both worth jack shit. Who else can we call? Well, Emergency Services said they wouldn't respond to any more prank calls from this address. And the neighbors are out of town. Yeah. I think our low point was when we called Pepe's and instead of coming to the house, the delivery boy just gave them the pizza. I say we'll make a run for it. Well, we don't have my keys. So we can't start the car. Then we keep swinging, until we hit the streets. We flag someone down and get the fuck out of here. And what if no vehicle is passing at that exact moment? We should barricade the doors. They can break through the windows, whenever they want. I'm not going out there. Why did he leave the gimp mask? Maybe somebody else at the party brought it? Someone wore this and none of us noticed? What does it matter? Because what if some of these weird things are connected? Like, why is there a bag of coke in the medicine cupboard? What? Whoa! That is not supposed to be in there. Maybe it belongs to your dads? Do you know how good Greg is at keeping secrets? My grandparents died thinking he and Bastian were just golf buddies. No way, he'd just keep coke in a medicine cupboard. So someone brought it to the party and left it there, just like they did the gimp mask. Wild party. And then guys in masks show up the next morning, and one of them breaks in, but only steals our car keys. Why? Who cares? We're in this mess because this douchebag doxed us on an incel forum. Just help me piece together what happened last night. I arrived at nine. There were a few other people from college, but also others I've never seen before. Who were they? Friends of friends? There were like 35, 40 people when I got here at eleven. How many did you recognize? Some of the guys I knew from football. Like Tom and Jeff. A few from campus. I don't know. Maybe half. Who were the other guys in the group email invite? I don't know. I wasn't on any group email invite. It was bcc. You couldn't see the other names. No, that there was personally addressed to me. You also texted me, when I didn't reply. 'Patrick, hope you got my mail. Sophie and I are throwing a party on Friday night at my dads' place. Hope you and Melanie can make it. Jo.' I thought it might help smooth things over. All right? You said, I should be pissed that he brought Melanie. Did I? Yeah. Before you said we should get revenge by making out in front of him. I fucking see this. There's nothing to see. Oh, really? You whisper poison in her ears, while we're together. And then set this whole thing up, so you could just fuck her on the rebound. Sophie, don't listen to this asshole. He brought Melanie here just to make you jealous. I only fucking brought her here because you invited her. Is that why half the guys were from my football team? I mean, why would a woke vegan like you even want to hang out with frat boys? - Because of the Bro Code, Sophie is off fucking limits, Jo. - The Bro Code is a lie. Did you invite Melanie? Sophie, please don't start thinking like this. Look, I know a lot of people get scared when they realize their true sexuality. But I promise you, there's nothing to be afraid of. Please. I need some space. You know, for a lesbian, you're a real fucking dick. No. I said, I don't want any more. No, I wanna get off. No, no, no. Hey, you okay? You've been in here for a while. Just needed some time to think. You know, sometimes shit happens when you're drunk. And you do stuff, you're not proud of. Like a few weeks back, Tom and Jeff beat up this guy outside this bar. I mean... I was there, and I didn't hit him or anything, but... I didn't do anything to stop them either. All I'm saying is, it doesn't necessarily define you as a person. I know, it must suck to have Jo take advantage of you, but that doesn't mean that... That I'm a lesbian? That's not what I meant, Sophie. Just, you know, we've had plenty of sex, and I like to think you liked it. Otherwise, I guess you wouldn't have had it with me. Unless you were gay. That would explain why you broke up with me. I told you. I've been offered a job with Deutsche Bank in New York, and I don't want to be in a long distance relationship. I could look for work there. Isn't being a couple about making a path together? Our careers don't have to determine our lives. Men only say that because they expect a woman to sacrifice her career. Do you know how many women have sidelined themselves because they needed to organize their lives around their husbands, kids, sick parents, or some other family shit? That's not happening to me. I'm going to be successful in my own right and everyone can organize their shit around that. I wasn't asking you to sacrifice anything, Sophie. I don't want to go over this again, Patrick. That doesn't sound like Tom and Jeff. The fight at the bar. They've been hanging out with this new guy. He's a real shit-stirrer. Was he at the party? Yeah, but I've never really spoken to him. He just sort of blends into the background. If they came after you posted the photo, then how did Pig get in? And why not do something while in here? They took my keys. But he couldn't have taken them this morning. Because you were already missing your keys when you woke up. And Rabbit already had them, while Pig was still in the house. Maybe Pig threw them out the window? I'll bet they also took Jo's car keys, to stop us making a run for it. How did Pig find them, if he was also hiding from us? But we do know there were people at the party searching through cupboards. Yeah, and they could move freely around the house. That means they were here before I posted the photo. Exactly. It's a pretext. Maybe that's why I don't remember writing it. Does anyone know your code? Fuck, I was so wasted last night, anybody could have seen me punch it in. Hold up. Maybe that explains why my phone was in here. If someone would have wanted to use it... They would have wanted some privacy. Fuck me. But what's up with the gimp mask? Guys, what's happening? What's happening, is that not only do you owe Sophie an apology. You also owe me one. They were here. At the party. But that's crazy. Who would do that? Why? Do you have any enemies? Aside from us, obviously. Any online harassment? Yes, but so does every other woman who's vocal about gay rights. Check the comments. 'Dyke, bitch, whore, feminazi, blah, blah blah.' 'Dick pic, rape, rape rape.' 'Kneel before the towering majestic phallus.' Who sent that one? The Big Gay Bunny. Two weeks ago. They aren't here, because of something I posted. They're here because of you. Fuck this shit. We're going. What do you mean, you're going? We wasted way too much time staying here and listening to all your bullshit, Jo. There's no fucking point in waiting for someone to come help us, when no one is fucking coming. Let's go. I can't see what's happening. It may be a trap. If the engine's still on, then the keys must still be in the car. Yeah. What? They'll be watching the door. Yeah. Looks clear. That's Melanie's car. Where is she? What the fuck is she doing here? Run. Stop, stop. Oh, shit. Go! Get in the car. Go. I can't see the other one? Fuck, get back inside. Get back inside. Go, go! Fuck! Come on. Jo, get in. - Come on, Jo. - Come on, get in. All right. Let's go. Come on, man. Hands off! Jesus, fuck. Jesus Q, motherfuck. What is wrong with you? You should be out of here now, driving to the police. I'm not leaving you here with these freaks. What good are you, if you're trapped in here with me? Hey, stop. Why the fuck was Melanie's car out there? Fuck. I have to admit, I was getting kind of bored. Mel! Take another step and she dies like a lesbian's dog. I'm calling the cops. Again? I've seen smarter lab mice. Let her go. Melanie here would like to know where her necklace is, and where you were last night. Yet another woman making demands of our Patrick. How do you know her name? Driver's license. Mel, I'm coming to get you, okay? Don't let that fuck scare you. You hear that, Melanie? They're making a hashtag for you. Bring back our girl. I bet all the Libs will retweet it. I'll have no choice but to let you go, once Oprah's book club endorses hashtag BBOG. How about a live video instead of a hashtag? Oh, Sophie, how can someone so smart still not get it? Anything you say will be used as evidence against you in a court of law. That's not the threat you think it is. Because you think the justice system has collapsed? No. Because I'm also live streaming this. Bullshit. Search for the Big Gay Bunny on Instagram. Where are you streaming this, Sophie? Some of my viewers want to open it in another window. What the fuck is this? That's what everyone wants to know: Am I a psycho threatening this poor young girl's life? Or am I an actor with some blunt scissors, threatening a girl, who hopes she gets a speaking line in this gonzo movie? Easy question. You're a fucking psycho. Oh, but you would say that. You're inside the movie. I'm more interested in what our viewers think. How many people are watching? Thousands. Everyone wants to know: How's it going to end? With you in fucking prison. Sadly, that Truman Show reference went right over her dyke haircut. But you can't expect much from the intersectionally inferior. Now for a montage of audience reaction shots. Guys, you've got to do your part. He's making it so no one knows this is real. There's no such thing as reality. There is only the matrix. And you are Neo. And now you are going to talk about redpilling and how you spent your teenage years beating off at the idea of being Keanu Reeves. Correction. I spent them beating off to Keanu Reeves. I was very confused about my sexuality, which is why I'm so mean to gay people. Is it? Oh, for fuck's sake, Jo. Try to understand. There is no gay, straight, black, white, because there's no one left to tell us what reality is. No Walter Cronkite to say, 'this is today's news.' What arrogance. But where's Walter, man? Just another guy in a striped shirt, lost in the crowd. We all live in our own personal discourse now. Maybe you're looking at me through the window. Or with me and Melanie in close up. But there's no God-like Walter Cronkite seat on the action. So you can scream whatever you want. People are going to hear whatever they choose to hear. Let's see what the cops think. Bunch of kids playing a prank. The whole Internet? Some unemployed actors who failed the audition with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Is this a scissors, I see before me? I have thee not. And yet I see thee still. Don't! Please let me go. Oh, she does get a line after all. No! God. Fuck. Fucking hell. Fuck. Fuck's sake. - Jesus. - No. Fuck's sake. No, he's got a gun. It's too dangerous. But are you sure the gun is real? Fuck this guy. No, fuck Jo. That was the deal. Now, my viewers are getting bored, and I need to get home, so I can put my kids to bed. Your what? It's important to read to your kids every night before sleep. I don't want them to be the kind of morons, who watch shit like this. No offense, guys. You have until nine. Then I want to see Jo's titties jiggling in the window, while Patrick takes her virginity. Wow. Lot of love for Jo's jiggling titties. Thanks everyone. Keep your suggestions coming. Kiss me. We need to stick together. Come on. What is the point? I'm not dying in here. You okay? They're the ones who did this. Not you. Melanie would still be alive, if she never met me. - Help me unmask them. - What's the point? Once we know who they are, we can work out how to stop them. And if that don't work? Then we have to go with Plan B. Let's start with what we know. They've been stalking Jo online for at least a couple of weeks. Wolf and Pig never speak, which suggests we would recognize their voices. So I think they were at the party. What about the blond guy? He arrived alone. He didn't strike me as the incel type. What about the guy in the suit? He was pretty charming. I remember that. If he's guilty of anything, it's most likely the used condom Jo found in her bedroom. Gross. Yeah, that was probably him and the redheaded girl. What about Tom and Jeff's new friend? That sadistic asshole? Yeah, maybe. But what's the connection with the gimp mask? Or the coke in the medicine cupboard? Or the cheese grater? Oh my fucking God, guys. Melanie just died. She was just killed in front of us. Who gives a fucking fuck about a fucking cheese grater? Do you have anything positive to contribute? Anything other than this shit is fine by me. Okay. Then I guess we're discussing plan B. What's plan B? We'll see what happens, if we give them what they want. Excuse me? Rabbit keeps saying, if we give them what they want, they'll leave. Have you forgotten what it is, that they want? No. Oh my God. You didn't have any problem getting me drunk last night, setting up the whole thing with Patrick and Melanie and my necklace. But it's okay for you to go all Brock Turner, because you don't have a penis? I'm not doing it. And I'm not dying in here. So if you have to do a perfectly natural act to get us out of this... Then we need to start considering it. Guys, stop. It's not going to fucking happen, okay? What does Melanie's necklace have to do with any of this? My necklace. That was my grandmother's. I forgot it at your place after we broke up. Is that why you were so upset? You had no right to just pass it on to your new girlfriend. That's what you said to me. Right before we started kissing. Wait, did you make out with Jo, because you were pissed off about the necklace? I know, you think, you were awakening my dormant lesbian sexuality. But you're not the first woman I've been with. She's not? So you're bi? No. Look. Sexuality is a big thing for you. For me, it's just another bodily function. When I'm hungry, I eat. When I'm tired, I sleep. When I'm horny, I fuck. Male, female, not that big an issue. Why didn't I know about this when we were together? You had a whole monogamy obsession. But... You've been trying to get in my pants since the day we met. Congratulations. You were nearby when I needed someone. That's not helpful, Jo. Jesus Christ, Sophie. Leave her alone. I'm sorry, but we have to stop giving a shit about who fucked who and start thinking of ways to get out of here. Speaking as someone who's bi, to use your terminology, taking a dick inside you isn't a big deal. We can see what happens, if we call their bluff. Nice job, Sophie. I know you were with other people when we were together. But what bothered me the most was how easy you would lie about it. Then why didn't you break up with me? Because I loved you. You cold-hearted bitch. You were right. We should have made a run for it. I'm sorry, Jo. I can't stay here any longer. When Sophie and I were dating, there were times, I thought she was autistic. I mean... She's a good person and all, but... She just has this coldness sometimes, you know. She's just so fucking pretty. Sometimes it's hard to see anything else, but that beautiful face of hers. Do you know how Sophie and I first met? I was the only person at the art house cinema, for a screening of Jeanne Dielman. It's this Belgian feminist classic from the 1970s. And it is so notoriously dreary, that I couldn't even convince other feminists to watch it with me. Fucking hell. And then the doors opened. And there's this beautiful girl standing in the light. I spent half the film just watching her. Every time she fixed her hair or crossed her legs. Just the two of us in that big room. And I had to go talk to her afterwards, I mean... She was the smartest person I've ever met. Mind like a scalpel. Just my luck, she's straight. And, you know, I kind of reconciled myself with that. But then last night... She just seemed less controlled than usual. There was something wild in her. So for a couple of hours, I thought: 'This is it. It's really happening.' And I knew I was going to pay for being that happy. I just... I just didn't know it was going to be this bad, you know? Yeah, she has that effect on people. Yeah. What they did... It's not your fault. Yeah. And maybe this whole thing ain't your fault either. Okay, first things first. You've got to apologize to Jo. We don't have time for this. Yes, we do. I'm sorry. All right? Good. Now I just need you to check your recent social media posts. Why? Because I'd like to know if a certain Big Gay Bunny Man has been following you as well. Recognize someone? Yeah, your friends Tom and Jeff really like my selfies. They've given me almost as many likes as Jo. - Check the red dress photo. - Why? Because it was particularly slutty. This is pointless. There's no reason... What? 'If you'll fuck anything, then why not also those who least deserve it.' 'The BGB.' Let me see. That was over a month ago. What the fuck is going on? I don't know, but... I think Sophie's right. They were at the party. But why the cheese grater? Someone was using it in the laundry room. To grate rat poison tablets into powder. They were going to poison someone. We're the ones, they've been stalking online. Then something happened. Jo and I started making out. So we were too busy to drink. Did Pig sleep in here? How would that be part of their plan? You're overthinking this. I mean, what is the simplest explanation for someone crashing on the floor after a party? You're shitfaced. Who were the most shitfaced guys at the party? Aside from me? Easy. Tom and Jeff. More so Jeff. He was off the rails. Wait, hold up. You two guys are not actually suggesting that Jeff is the Little Horny Pig, right? Let's game this out. You're Jeff. Somehow you end up in an incel group. - Wait, Sophie. That's insane. - No, I want to hear this. Whatever the plan was, it didn't pan out. You get utterly shitfaced and pass out in the office. Then you wake up and have to sneak out. You sneak past us while we're distracted by Wolf and Rabbit. But then you realize you've left a bag of coke in the medicine cupboard. So you hide in here and wait for a chance to get it. And then I come into Jo's room for a change of clothes. And go into the bathroom. And because I'm a big perv, I come to watch. Wolf and Rabbit were trying to peek in the window when I first pulled the curtain back. Because they were looking for Pig. So they distracted us, so that he could sneak past. Which is why Pig didn't attack. He didn't break in. He was trying to break out. Then why the gimp mask, and why leave it? Because if you're Tom and Jeff, you wouldn't follow instructions. That's why Wolf is wearing a bear mask. And Jeff bought this one instead of a pig mask. He would have just thought it was funny. But how did the necklace end up in the hallway? That was me. What? I asked Melanie to wear it, to piss you off. But when I saw how upset you were, I took it back. That's why she left. Then I... left it on the table for you and went to the bathroom to throw up. Thanks for getting my necklace back. I'm sorry, I kept it after we broke up. If Pig is Jeff, then Wolf has got to be Tom. That is why they never speak. But those guys are harmless. They would never kill someone or even someone's dog. I mean... Tom loves dogs. It's just... It doesn't add up. But neither of them were there. It was Rabbit both times. So if they are Tom and Jeff... Then they don't know. Because it's a fucking prank. They're just frat boys having a laugh. Except for Rabbit. But if they're that dumb, we can't just send them the video of Rabbit killing Melanie. He'll talk them out of believing in it. So what do we do? Gentlemen of culture, thank you for joining us. We're about to find out if our brother Patrick will proclaim the mastery of the penis over our would-be lesbian overlords... Or if he's just another pussy-whipped pseudo male. There's like no fucking way, they're gonna do it. I would piss myself if they did though. Wolf, Pig, not while streaming. The time is 9 p.m. We're going to have to send them another reminder. Dude, I already told you. I'm out of here at 10. I can't believe they're staying in there for this long, but I've got training at six. Yeah, and he's my ride, so... What? Oh, my God. Hey. Oh, my God. Hey, look. No fucking way. This is crazy, man. I didn't believe they were gonna do it. Pig, please get closer and verify that she is being penetrated. Wolf, please stop Sophie making a run out the front door. But I don't want to miss the show. Just fucking do it. - Hello, Tom. - Shit. There's something you need to see. Titties jiggling enough for you, Jeff? Fuck you, Jeff. We know it's you under the mask, asshole. That was amazing. Oh my God. That was so good. I cannot believe that happened. Oh, my God. You're an idiot. That was crazy. Oh, my God. That was so. I cannot believe that happened. Oh man, you idiot. Do you know what just fucking happened there? No, that was crazy. Best thing I've ever, like... That was so good, man. You idiot. That was... - Oh, my God. - Jeff? Tom. That was so... That was so crazy, though. Did you just? Did you just? - Jeff, there's something you need to see. - That was so crazy. Jeff! Please, let me go. Fuck. Fucking hell. But it was just a... I think this shit got out of hand, man. I mean, did Melanie really just take the bus home? That's what you think happened? It was just a... It was just a prank. Once we guessed these two were Tom and Jeff, we knew it was all just you. So now it's five against one, asshole. Let's grab this fuck. Those two were the kind of guys, that make me understand what feminists have against men. Go, go. The police can't ignore this. Probably not. To paraphrase Stalin, '3 million deaths would be a statistic, but three is unfortunately just murder.' Then shouldn't you be running? Like a rabbit? Who do you think I am? Were you at the party? Picture any scene from last night. See that nondescript white guy in the background? You could have said hi at any time. Maybe then I might have let you live. Who are you? I'm the nice guy that all the girls swipe left on. I'm the better candidate who didn't get the promotion, because we need to support women and minorities. I'm the straight, white, middle class male, that your culture says needs to be punished for the crime of being himself. So you're the real victim here? You're not a fucking hero. And that leaves only one role. I've read your critical race theorists, your queer post-colonials, your anti-phallogocentric feminists. They are all about exposing guys like me as monsters. You want to know the weird thing? I used to be a genuinely nice guy. I recycled. I volunteered for worthy causes. I even had a poster of Barack Obama. But if this culture needs me to be a monster... Then a monster is what it's going to get. You don't have to do this. I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore. You are crazy. I'm quoting Peter Finch in Network, Jo. It's a classic. Try to keep up. At least our viewers got that reference. Wait, you're still streaming this shit? Of course. I'm getting like PewDiePie level numbers. Right now, chat is all about how you guys will keep me talking until the cops arrive. So what's the plan? Sophie finally going to get her tits out? Guys, it's the Internet. If people get bored for 10 seconds, they're gone. And I haven't killed someone in, like, 3 minutes. So, I promise not to kill you before the police arrive, if... Drum roll... Jo sucks Patrick's cock until they get here. Fuck you. Let me put that another way: Would you rather die, than suck a man's penis? No. I don't see why you're against it. You've got the good bit. No to all your bullshit. You're going to be a hero now, Patrick? No. I'm kind of a shitty person to be honest. But I don't have to stand by anymore while you degrade others. I'm not going to participate in this shit. I can still tell you to shut the fuck up, and I'm going to stand between you and them, so I can tell you where to shove it. Wow, Patrick. I guess this is the part of the movie where I congratulate you on finally learning what it means to be a real man... and let you all go. If this movie were Phone Booth... Which it's not. Because this isn't the kind of movie... Fuck you. This isn't the kind of movie in which woke liberal values triumph. You act like this is all part of your script, but that's bullshit. This was never your plan. You fucked up last night. What was the rat poison for? This house was full of female rodents who think they're too good for men. Jo, who doesn't need them for sex, you, who don't need them for your career, and Melanie, who turned down the chance to get spit roasted by Tom and Jeff. And if there is one thing we learn from watching porn, it's that women love two dicks at once. But then Jo and I started making out. No, we were fine with that. But then Melanie stormed off, and we couldn't pin the whole thing on Patrick, because the dumbass passed out in the toilet. But this is even better. A die hard feminazi lesbian dying in the kitchen, the way a woman should. Where were your beliefs in gender fluidity when Patrick needed them, Jo? I thought everything was a social construct, but ask you to suck your friend's cock for a couple of minutes to save his life and suddenly it's all 'Oh no, it would be a betrayal of my identity.' How could you know? You're not a woman. Thank God. That's a quote from a movie, you moron. Okay, I'll bite. What movie? And here I thought, you knew all the movies. Jeanne Dielman. Never heard of it. It's a feminist classic. Then I'm glad I haven't seen it. Too bad. If you had, you'd understand what you've overlooked. Too bad for you, that I have thousands of pop culture nerds following live. Nerd marines, ten hut. Why is this bitch talking about Jeanne Dielman? And you wonder why you're still a virgin? The audience is going to love this theory. Because you're a coward who wilts like a flaccid cock, the moment anyone can see his face. You? But you're not some twisted loser. Even now, with all your intelligence, you comfort yourself with the belief that people like me are anomalies, deviants, marginal cases. But do you hear that, Sophie? That is the silence of no one coming to your rescue. We're your manifesto. I didn't come here to punish you for something you are or did. I came here to demonstrate a truth, your kind refuses to accept: The liberal order is over. What do you mean, none of you shitheads has seen Jeanne Dielman? It's called collective intelligence, not collective ignorance. Patrick? Come on, Patrick. No. Patrick. Jo? Jo? I'm calling an ambulance. You're gonna be okay. It's okay, Jo. It's okay. Jo. Jo, they're coming. You're gonna be okay. I promise. I said, I'd protect you. It's gonna be okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay. Jo, you're gonna be okay. You're gonna be okay. Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo? Jo? Don't leave me. They're not coming for you, you moron. Open up. Ma'am, we need you to open this door now. Break it down.
