Sompote Saengduenchai Director The Sun is merciless, each day hotter, the earth dries up. Fires are countless. What's wrong? I'm going to push! Start it up! What are you doing!? Move, I'll drive! Start it! We're out of luck... Look at yourself! (They dance like Hanuman, hoping for better luck) It's the heat. Birds are falling from the sky! - How hot is it? - 50 degrees! I'm dying! Water, water! The children organized a ceremony to bring rain. The child wearing the Hanuman mask is our hero. His name is Koh. Please, Gods of the sky, it's too hot! We can't take it anymore, make it rain! Where are you, Rain Angel? Why is there no rain? Please make it rain! Let it rain, let it rain! Water! Where can we find water? Water! Finally! I'm alive again! I was dying! If this keeps up, we'll end up as ashes! Dr. Wisut found a way to make it rain. That's right! Dr. Wisut will save us! No! I make the rain! Here comes the rain! No swimming. Potable water. Don't look behind me! You too, don't look! Sipuak and Sisuliya are actually excellent renowned pilots. This is the missile base, Donna 7. The rain-making missiles will be launched from here. The first launch will be supervised by Dr. Wisut. This is the laboratory, and over there is the control center. Doctor, everything is ready. We're going to launch the first missile. Some rain should fall. If it works, we'll continue with the launches. Until the earth has enough water for the plants to grow again. Thank you for trying, Doctor. Let's keep our fingers crossed! Let's go. You may be forgetting something, Doctor... - What? - Don't ignore the supernatural forces. Ah, yes... Let's also ask the angels for rain. This is absurd, Malissa! I have science, no need for angels! Koh, come dance! It's done! We're going to be rich! What are you doing? - Dirty thieves! - Get out! Give it back! - Stop! - Hurry! Stop! Give it back! Why is this kid so strong? He's really strong! Where are you going? Stop! Mind your own business! Koh! Koh! Let's go! We're leaving! - Stop! - You little brat! Wait a minute, thief! Thieves! There! Let's go! Thieves! Stop! Hurry up! Stupid kid, do you want to die? Stop, you filthy thieves! Koh! Koh! He's injured. Don't die! He's dead! Koh is dead! On planet M78, the mother of the Ultras, gathers her 6 sons responsible for the security of the galaxies. They witnessed Koh's death. Koh is good, intelligent, and takes good care of the temple, his death is unfair. The mother of the Ultras transports Koh's body to M78. The Ultras merge his body with Hanuman, So Koh can return to Earth as a avenger. What's this hand? It's taking Koh away! Hanuman! He's flying, he's coming to help us! Hooray for Hanuman! Goodbye Hanuman! Koh is dead, but he has become Hanuman. Koh! Koh! Goodbye, Koh! Goodbye, Koh! What happened, Malissa? Annan disappeared running after Hanuman. Hanuman? That's ridiculous! Hanuman doesn't exist! The heat makes everyone crazy! Let's get back to work. We will launch the missiles. It will rain and the heat will disappear. Long ago, Phra Ram and his brother Phra Lak Faced the demon Thotsakan, Phra Lak was wounded by a lance. A wise man said that only the sap of the Sangkon flower, which grows on the Sappaia mountain, could heal Phra Lak. Hanuman set out to find the flower, but the wise man said the flower had to be picked before sunrise, Hanuman decided to slow down the course of the Sun. Who dares to stop the Sun? Phra Lak is dying, a demon's lance has pierced him. Sun, would you help me and slow down? The balance of the universe would be lost! But Phra Lak is a saint, he must live to fight the demon Ayaklay, who is a danger to the universe. I will slow down. - Thank you, Sun! - Now go, Hanuman! Where are you, flower? I am coming to find you! Here, at the top of the mountain. I'm coming to get you! She's gone! Where are you now? Down here, not up there! I'm coming down, don't go anywhere! Where are you? Ah, here! Gone again! Here, I'm here! Don't play games with me! I'll eventually catch you, stop bothering me! You won't escape me! Enough, witness my strength! I am invincible! I will encircle the mountain with my tail, you won't escape me! Witness my power! You won't make fun of me anymore! I will catch you! And so, Hanuman was able to save Phra Lak with the flower. Hanuman, help me, the heat will kill me! Hanuman, help me, the heat will kill me! - Soon we'll have money! - I don't care, I'm thirsty! - Idiot! With money, you can have everything! - Look! - The boy we killed! - Impossible! Look, he's dancing! Why is he here? Why is he dancing like that? - Get out of the way, we'll run you over! - I'm thirsty! Is he a ghost or a human? Bring him down! - Now! - Okay! He's still there! I emptied the clip! He won't die! He's still alive, and now he's praying. It's Hanuman, I can't believe my eyes! Quick, we have to get out of here! Wait for me! Turn, he's there! Thieves, what are you doing? You don't deserve to live! Faster! We have to escape! You will die! You cut off Buddha's head! You will not escape death! You cannot flee, I will chase you forever! Your life is over, you are cursed forever! Do not flee, no one can escape my revenge! You are finished! Here I am! Worshippers can no longer see Buddha's head. You destroyed a sacred place! Do you think you can fight me? No one can fight me! Die by my hand! Disappear now! It's still so hot! I must once again ask the Sun to slow down its course. Who is there? Hanuman! You have forgotten me and forgotten to keep your promise. Hanuman, what now? You are burning the earth. This is not good. Why would I do that? You are too close to the earth, you will eventually destroy it, humans will perish, I don't want that to happen. Your flames are so powerful, everything dries up. I understand. There is no more rain. Move away from the earth, please. I will, sorry Hanuman. The earth will be saved. Annan. Koh... Koh, you're here! I was so sad when the thieves killed you! Koh, where are you going? Koh, what are you doing? Koh! Understand this, Koh, I am Hanuman and I am inside your body. You are not the same anymore... It will rain soon, tell everyone. Rain? Wait, Koh! Koh! The time has come for Dr. Wisut to launch the missiles and finally bring back the rain. - Malissa, get ready. - Ok. Launch in one minute. 59, 58, 57, 56... If it works, it will rain and we will be famous. Let's hope everything works. 10, 9, 8, 7... 2, 1, fire! Explosion in five seconds! Il pleut! Fantastique! C'Ã©tait vrai! - Doctor, it's raining. - I told you it would. It's just a small shower, but it's rain! We did it! We're happy! Congratulations, Doctor! It's 38 degrees, the temperature is dropping. Everything is going as planned. That's right! The doctor is a genius! When we launch more missiles, there will be more rain. We are so happy! In 30 minutes, we will launch all the missiles. Notify headquarters. Come here, you two! We're so excited! Calm down and go back to the control room. Prepare for immediate launch. This time it's really important. I'll do the countdown. Get ready! Final check. Perfect! Doctor... I'm starting. 59, 58,... Doctor, we have to stop, there's a problem... Impossible, not now! There are so many clouds! - 37, 36, 35... - Doctor! - Who says I have to stop? - The headquarters. If there was a problem, we would have heard the alarm. Doctor, check again. It's already been done, I wouldn't change anything, it's too late! 14, 13, 12, 11... - An earthquake! - Doctor, we have to save him! - What is that? - A monster! Monsters everywhere! Here! And there! Doctor, what's happening? Wake up! There are monsters everywhere! - Impossible! - It's true! - It's all your fault, Doctor! - Do something! My heart almost exploded when I saw the monsters! Restart the machines! The screen is working again! - Where are you going? It's dangerous! - Leave me alone! Don't go out, it's safe here. This is a fallout shelter! There are monsters outside! I have to find Annan! Annan, where are you? Here! The monsters are here, they can't climb trees! Come down, you might get hurt! Get down, quickly! They are here! They are here! Are you okay? Are you okay? I came to get you, little brother, I was worried. I was worried too, I couldn't find you. Everyone was running and scared. Everything exploded! My sister! We need to find Koh. Koh? Koh can stop the monsters, he has become Hanuman. Hanuman?! It's true, we need to find him! - But, no... - Koh! Annan, what does it mean? Koh is dead but he came back. He saved me with flowers, and was helped by the sun. He also said that it would rain. Is it possible? He had the help of the sun. So he could get the flowers. The flowers of the legend. - It's true, I'm not lying! - Impossible! - Koh! - Annan! Where are you going? But what are these monsters? Everything is going to explode! - They're full of fuel, it's going to explode! - What can we do? Faster, sis! Wait for me! Koh! Koh! Quick, sister, I see Koh! Look, Hanuman! Hanuman!?

How are you, Hanuman? Thank you, Ultramen, I'm ready to fight again! Let me handle these monsters. Take that! Come here! You filthy monsters! What's happening? - Doctor! - Doctor! Everything is going to explode! - There are explosions outside! - Let's go! Are you leaving? The missiles are gone, and there are no pilots inside. Then go, I'm safe here! I'm safe! We must fight and destroy the monsters! Ready? Ready for battle? Let's destroy these monsters! Now, fight! Hey, Sisuliya. Look at this! Fight, my friends! Hanuman, our savior. - Who are the others? - I don't know. - Where do they come from? - I don't know. - Will the tanks explode? - I don't know. Everything is Dr. Wisut's fault. But he couldn't have known about the monsters... Hanuman and his friends will kill the monsters. Go Hanuman, fight! Go Ultramen, fight! Can someone help two pilots land? - Help! - Sisuliya, help me! Can anyone get us out of this tree? Who wants to retrieve two pilots? I can't hold on anymore! He's dead, I don't want to see his ghost! I'll perform the funeral rites. Sisuliya! - What's up, Annan? - Something's moving. Do you think so? - The leaves are moving. - I don't see anything. - Maybe I'm not seeing well. - Let's go. - The monsters will be killed. - I hope Dr. Wisut is okay. The lab may be damaged, but not destroyed. The scientists don't believe in Hanuman. Ouch! - Is your leg broken? - No, I'll be fine. There's enough fuel in these tanks to send 200 missiles to the moon, and the heat is increasing... They're going to explode! Hanuman, help me! Sisuliya, my dear friend! Let's finish off this one. All together! Hanu-slash! They'll die without their heads! Hanuman is the winner! Quickly, we have to go! Annan, what is it? Look, hurry! An Ultraman is in danger! Look, Annan! Hanuman! Hanuman! - I will help you! - Thank you, Hanuman! Take this! Pierce him with your trident! Deflate this balloon! Tear off his face! Why tear off my skin? Tear off his arms! Let's finish him off! Hanu-hurricane! They have won! Bravo! Hanuman, merci, arigato, thank you! I want to fight another one! Hanuman, look! Attack! Let's fight! You think you're strong? You'll see! This is what strength is! All together! Let's finish it quickly! Hanu-crescent cutter! Let's go see, it exploded. Everything is destroyed. But Hanuman is the winner! We're alive! Well done! Goodbye my dear Ultra brothers, Safe journey, and thank you for everything! I will now be the guardian of the earth. And I, Sompote Saengduenchai (director), thank you, dear viewers! END
