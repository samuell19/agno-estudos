THE FIRST QUESTION IS "WHAT DO YOU WANT?" I DON'T KNOW. TO BE HAPPY? TO BE HAPPY. I WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM. I WANT TO BE HAPPY. WOULD IT SURPRISE YOU TO KNOW THAT IN A RECENT SURVEY, THIS RICKSHAW DRIVER, MANOJ SINGH, WAS FOUND TO BE AS HAPPY AS THE AVERAGE AMERICAN? FOR HUNDREDS, MAYBE EVEN THOUSANDS OF YEARS, PEOPLE HAVE STUDIED DEPRESSION AND PSYCHOLOGICAL ILLNESS. THE GOAL OF PSYCHOLOGISTS WAS PRIMARILY TO RID A PATIENT OF THEIR PROBLEMS. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, MODERN SCIENCE HAS BEGUN TO LOOK AT HOW HAPPINESS WORKS. WHAT ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A LIFE THAT'S NOT JUST FREE OF ILLNESS, BUT ONE THAT FLOURISHES WITH A DEEP AND GENUINE HAPPINESS? WHEN I GOT INTO HAPPINESS RESEARCH, IT WAS 1981. IT WAS NOT A POPULAR FIELD IN PSYCHOLOGY. PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WAS FLAKY, THAT IT WAS LOOSE. A PROFESSOR SAID TO ME, "YOU CAN NEVER MEASURE HAPPINESS." NOW, WHY THEY THOUGHT YOU COULD MEASURE DEPRESSION, WHICH THEY WERE ALL DOING, BUT YOU COULDN'T MEASURE HAPPINESS, I'M NOT SURE. AND THEN, IN THE '90s, PEOPLE STARTED GETTING INTERESTED IN IT. AND NOW IT'S ABSOLUTELY AMAZING HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED. MAGAZINE ARTICLES AND BOOKS ARE BEING WRITTEN ABOUT IT. THERE'S EVEN A NEW FIELD OF SCIENCE CALLED "POSITIVE PSYCHOLOGY," WHICH STUDIES HAPPINESS. IT BECAME THE MOST POPULAR CLASS AT HARVARD, WITH 1,000 KIDS SHOWING UP EVERY WEEK FOR A HAPPINESS CLASS. THE FIRST THING IS TO REALIZE THAT HAPPINESS CAN ACTUALLY HELP YOU GET YOUR OTHER GOALS, HAVE BETTER RELATIONSHIPS, MAKE MORE MONEY, DO BETTER AT THE JOB. PEOPLE ON THE JOB ARE GONNA LIKE YOU BETTER IF YOU'RE HAPPY. WHAT WE'VE DONE -- AND I'VE DONE THIS FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS COLLECTING DATA. SO, WE FOLLOW PEOPLE AND LOOK AT THEIR MOODS OVER TIME. WE'VE ALSO LOOKED AT RANDOM SAMPLES OF PEOPLE FROM AROUND THE WORLD, WHO'S HAPPY, WHO'S NOT HAPPY. THEN WE CRUNCH ALL THESE NUMBERS AND WE SAY, "GEE, WHAT REALLY MATTERS?" BY STUDYING IDENTICAL TWINS, PEOPLE WITH ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME GENETIC MAKEUP, RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THAT APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE DIFFERENCES IN OUR HAPPINESS LEVELS IS DETERMINED BY OUR GENES. THEY CALL THAT OUR "GENETIC SET POINT," OR OUR "GENETIC SET RANGE." MOST OF US ARE BORN WITH A CERTAIN RANGE OF HAPPINESS THAT WE FALL IN MOST OF THE TIME. AND EVEN WHEN REALLY GOOD OR REALLY BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO US, WE KIND OF TEND TO RETURN TO OUR SET POINT. AND WHILE 50% IS GENETIC, AMAZINGLY, OUR CIRCUMSTANCES, LIKE WHAT JOB WE HAVE OR HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE, OUR SOCIAL STATUS, OUR HEALTH, THOSE THINGS THAT MANY OF US ARE TOLD TO FOCUS ON, THEY ONLY ACCOUNT FOR 10% OF THE DIFFERENCES IN OUR HAPPINESS. MOST PEOPLE ARE KIND OF STUNNED AT HOW SMALL THAT IS, BUT THAT STILL LEAVES 40% UNACCOUNTED FOR. AND SO OUR THEORY SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL YOU CAN DO TO BECOME HAPPIER, AND THAT 40% IS LEFT FOR KIND OF INTENTIONAL BEHAVIOR, YOU KNOW, THINGS THAT WE CAN DO ON A REGULAR BASIS TO BECOME HAPPIER. IT'S VERY IMPORTANT IF A PERSON WANTS TO BECOME HAPPIER TO TRY NOT TO ADAPT TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING. SO, THEY WOULD CONSCIOUSLY VARY WHAT THEY DO. IT COULD BE LIKE WHEN YOU DO YOUR DAILY RUN THAT YOU TAKE A DIFFERENT ROUTE. I MEAN, THAT'S NOT REALLY, YOU KNOW, MIND-BOGGLING. FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT'S GONNA BE A LOT OF CHANGE. FOR SOME PEOPLE, IT'S GONNA BE A LITTLE. BUT THAT CHANGE IS IMPORTANT. VARIETY IS THE SPICE OF LIFE. THIS IS A PARADISE TO ME. THAT'S WHY I LOVE IT SO MUCH. AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE. PEOPLE EITHER CALL ME FOR A TOUR, "WHAT WE GONNA SEE?" "I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE, BUT WE'RE GONNA SEE SOMETHING." LOOK RIGHT THERE. THAT'S A CRAWFISH EATER. LOOK AT THAT ALLIGATOR ON THAT BIG LOG. SEE IT? I FEEL LIKE A KID, MAN. AND RIGHT WHERE WE AT THERE, STRAIGHT AHEAD, MY HOUSE IS RIGHT THERE ACROSS THE LEVEE. IN THE AFTERNOON SOMETIMES, I'M KIND OF, LIKE, DOWN A LITTLE BIT. I JUMP IN MY 4-WHEELER, AND I COME PARK RIGHT THERE. MY HOUSE IS RIGHT THERE. AND I WATCH THESE BIRDS PASS AND JUST LISTEN TO THE STILLNESS. THIS, YOU KNOW, WILDLIFE AND BEING OUT HERE, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE. BUT NATURE, ESPECIALLY LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW, IT'S GOOD MEDICINE. THIS IS MY HAPPINESS. ANY DISCUSSION OF HAPPINESS CENTERS A LOT ON DOPAMINE. DOPAMINE IS A CHEMICAL IN THE BRAIN CALLED A NEUROTRANSMITTER THAT'S NECESSARY FOR FEELINGS OF PLEASURE AND HAPPINESS. SO, ELECTRICAL IMPULSES COME DOWN A NERVE, THEY HIT THE CONNECTION, AND THE CONNECTION RELEASES CHEMICALS. THE CHEMICALS DIFFUSE TO THE NEXT NERVE CELL. THEY BIND TO RECEPTORS IN THE NEXT NERVE CELL, AND THEY CAUSE AN ELECTRICAL CHANGE. THAT CHEMICAL RELEASE THAT IS RELEASED IS CALLED A NEUROTRANSMIT. PRETTY MUCH, AS YOU AGE FROM ABOUT TEENAGE YEARS ONWARD, YOU'RE SLOWLY LOSING DOPAMINE SYNAPSES AND PROBABLY DOPAMINE NEURONS, AS WELL. AS FAR AS WE KNOW, NO ONE'S OBSERVED THOSE REGENERATING. IF IT'S TOO SEVERE, THEN YOU END UP WITH PARKINSON'S DISEASE. THE BODY ADAPTS TO WHAT IT NEEDS TO DO. SO, THE "USE IT OR LOSE IT" PROBABLY APPLIES TO SOME DEGREE IN THE BRAIN, AS WELL. AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE TO SEEK OUT EXPERIENCES THAT RELEASE DOPAMINE OR YOU NEED DOPAMINE TO DO. THE THINGS THAT ARE BEST AT DOING THAT, INTERESTINGLY, INVOLVE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY. SO, AEROBIC EXERCISE IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BEST RELEASERS OF DOPAMINE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU DO IT IN NOVEL WAYS. WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY? LIKE, BANANA SPLITS. I LIKE BANANA PEELS. I LIKE BIG BANANAS. THE BRAIN IS BASICALLY -- ON THIS LEVEL, IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO A MUSCLE. THE PARTS OF THE BRAIN THAT ARE... I'M SORRY. I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA SAY THE BRAIN IS A SPONGE. BUT I'LL GO WITH MUSCLE. IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE'S ANOTHER COMPONENT OF SURFING AND EXERCISE THAT CAN INCREASE YOUR HAPPINESS. IT'S WHAT AN ATHLETE WOULD CALL "BEING IN THE ZONE." I STARTED STUDYING PEOPLE WHO WERE DOING SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT AND DEMANDING FOR NO GOOD REASON -- NO MONEY, NO STATUS, NOTHING, BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY LIKE TO DO IT. MY UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT MOTIVATED THESE ACTIVITIES WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT CAME FROM OUTSIDE BUT IT CAME FROM THE ACTIVITY ITSELF. AND I GAVE THE NAME "FLOW" TO THIS KIND OF SYNERGY OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CONSCIOUSNESS, WHERE YOU WISH YOU COULD GO FOREVER BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE YOU ARE COMPLETELY FULFILLING SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN DO WELL AND THAT YOU CAN SEE IT HAPPENING AND YOU FEEL THAT NOTHING ELSE MATTERS. TO HAVE VERY CLEAR GOALS THAT YOU KNOW MOMENT BY MOMENT WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO. LIKE IF YOU'RE SINGING OR PLAYING A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, YOU ALWAYS KNOW WHAT NOTES OR CHORDS YOU WANT TO PLAY NEXT AND YOU CAN HEAR WHETHER YOU'RE DOING IT RIGHT OR NOT. PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION FEEL IN CONTROL, THEY FORGET THEIR PROBLEMS. INTERESTINGLY, THEY FORGET THEMSELVES, SO THAT THE KIND OF EGO THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS AWARE OF IN EVERYDAY LIFE DISAPPEARS. IT BUILDS OVER TIME A FEELING THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING. FLOW CAN HAPPEN ALMOST ANYWHERE. IT CAN HAPPEN DURING PERSONAL TIME, OR IT CAN HAPPEN WITH YOUR FAMILY. IT CAN EVEN HAPPEN AT YOUR JOB. IT'S ALL IN THE RHYTHM. IT'S ALL IN KEEPING THE RHYTHM GOING. DOING IT 14 YEARS. I LOVE IT. DON'T WANT TO GO NOWHERE ELSE. WHY DO YOU LOVE IT? I LIKE COOKING, ALWAYS DID. I GOT A ORDER OF HASH BROWNS ON THE WAY. PATTY MELT? MASTER GRILL OPERATOR. THE RESEARCH IS CLEAR. PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE FLOW ON A REGULAR BASIS ARE HAPPIER THAN THOSE WHO DON'T. MUCH OF WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT THE CAUSES AND SOURCES OF HAPPINESS SIMPLY ISN'T TRUE. PEOPLE OVERESTIMATE HOW MUCH IMPACT BOTH GOOD AND BAD EVENTS WILL HAVE ON THEM IN THE FUTURE. PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF GOOD THINGS HAPPEN, THEY'RE GONNA BE ECSTATIC AND THAT JOY WILL LAST A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, THEY ARE ECSTATIC, AND THE JOY QUICKLY DISSIPATES. PEOPLE BELIEVE THAT IF BAD THINGS HAPPEN, LOSING A LOVER, LOSING A FOOTBALL GAME, LOSING A JOB, THEY WILL BE DEVASTATED AND DEVASTATED FOR A VERY LONG TIME. IN FACT, THEY ARE DEVASTATED FOR A VERY SHORT TIME. IN GENERAL, PEOPLE DO REALLY GOOD WHEN THINGS GO REALLY BAD. SOUNDS LIKE A COUNTRY SONG, BUT IT ACTUALLY TURNS OUT TO BE TRUE. THIS IS "TOWN &amp; COUNTRY" IN 1969, AND I WAS FEATURED AS ONE OF THE TOP-50 DEBUTANTES IN THE COUNTRY AT THE INTERNATIONAL BALL, ALONG WITH TRICIA NIXON AND PEOPLE LIKE THAT. SHE WAS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, AND I STILL HAVE PICTURES OF HER, YOU KNOW, WHEN SHE WAS 20. ALL MY MEMORIES OF MY MOTHER ARE JUST FOND, AND, I MEAN, SHE WAS A GENUINELY GOOD MOTHER ALL MY LIFE. I WAS VERY, VERY BUSY RAISING THREE CHILDREN AND LOVING THAT AND RAISING HORSES ON MY RANCH AND DOING VOLUNTEER WORK. I HAD A VERY FULL LIFE, BUSY, BUSY, BUSY. MY KIDS WERE IN SOCCER AND BASEBALL AND THINGS LIKE THAT. WHEN I WAS RUN OVER BY A TRUCK IN 1992, I WAS IN SHOCK. MY WHOLE LIFE CHANGED INSTANTANEOUSLY. IT WAS THE 4th OF JULY ON MY FAMILY RANCH IN TEXAS, WHERE I'M FROM. WE WERE COMING IN OUR TRUCK FROM THE BARN RIGHT HERE. AND AS WE WERE APPROACHING, I SAW MY SISTER-IN-LAW DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD IN HER TRUCK. AND I THOUGHT, "WELL, IF SHE STOPS, I'LL GET OUT, AND WE'LL TALK." AND, SO, SHE DID. AND I GOT OUT, AND I GUESS IT WAS RIGHT HERE, ACTUALLY, WHERE THE TRUCK WAS. AND WE WERE HAVING A DISAGREEMENT. WOW. SHE DROVE OFF IN A HURRY, AND WHEN SHE DID, MY HAND WAS ON THE DOOR HANDLE. I WAS RUNNING ALONGSIDE TRYING TO GET MY HAND OUT AND SCREAMING AND FELL. AND WHEN I FELL, I WAS DRAGGED UNTIL MY HAND DISENGAGED AND I FELL UNDER THE TRUCK. I WAS CRAWLING AND CLAWING THE GRAVEL TO TRY AND GET AWAY, AND I COULDN'T. AND IT WENT UP MY SPINE AND OVER MY HEAD AND CRUSHED MY FACE IN THE ROCKS. MY DAD HAD ALREADY JUMPED OUT OF THE TRUCK AND WAS SCREAMING. AND I GOT THERE, AND, OF COURSE, WE BOTH THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD. WHEN I WAS IN I.C.U., THEY COULD ONLY RECOGNIZE ME BY MY HANDS. JUST, OH, MY POOR BEAUTIFUL MOTHER. AND I HAD FRIENDS WHO DIDN'T KNOW WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO ME. IF I SAW THEM ON THE STREET AND WENT UP TO THEM, THEY JUST...FELL APART AND STARTED CRYING AND WERE HORRIFIED. MY HUSBAND DIVORCED ME AND LEFT ME. UM, HE BECAME A REALLY BAD ALCOHOLIC. IT WAS VERY TRAUMATIC FOR HIM, TOO, BUT FOR 9Â½ YEARS, I WAS TOTALLY DISABLED. I'VE HAD 30 SURGERIES ON MY FACE. I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A DREAM OR IF IT WAS A VISION OR WHATEVER, 'CAUSE I WAS KIND OF GROGGY AFTER THE SURGERY AND I HAD THESE IMAGES OF... NOT AN IMAGE THAT I HAD REMEMBERED EVER SEEING ON MY DAD'S FACE, BUT JUST THIS LECHEROUS LOOK. THE MEMORIES THAT WERE COMING BACK WERE OF ABUSE BY HIM -- NOT JUST FONDLING ME, BUT ALSO RAPING AND THREATENING TO KILL ME WITH HIS HANDS AROUND MY NECK WHEN I FOUGHT. I GUESS THE SHOCK OF THE TRAUMA CRACKED THIS VERY GOOD DENIAL SYSTEM I HAD BUILT UP IN MY LIFE. I JUST REALLY WAS ANGRY I WAS ALIVE. I THOUGHT ABOUT KILLING MYSELF. I WOULD BUY MYSELF TIME, SAY, "WELL, OKAY. "THAT'S ALWAYS AN OPTION, BUT I'LL WAIT SIX MONTHS, BECAUSE I'VE GOT TO BE HERE FOR MY KIDS TODAY." I'D ALWAYS BEEN A SUPER DOER, AN OVERACHIEVER, A NEED-TO-KNOW PERSON. AND TO BE ABLE TO SAY, "I DON'T UNDERSTAND, AND I DON'T NEED TO UNDERSTAND, AND THAT'S OKAY," IT WAS KIND OF A CATALYST OF A HEALING PROCESS IN MY ENTIRE FAMILY. BUT IT WAS VERY SCARY. IN MY LIFE, INTEGRATING, ACCEPTING ALL OF MY LIFE IS PART OF HEALING. HELLO. I HAVE HORSES. I FOUND THEM VERY HEALING TO ME. I HAD SEEN HIM AT ONE OF MY STEP-DAUGHTER'S WEDDING. WE KNEW EACH OTHER YEARS AGO, AND HE ASKED ME THINGS LIKE, DID MY NOSE WORK? AND I LIKED AND APPRECIATED THAT, YOU KNOW? AND WHAT WAS IT LIKE HAVING BEEN BEAUTIFUL AND THEN NOT? HE WASN'T AFRAID TO TALK TO ME, TO TALK ABOUT THINGS. AND WE GOT MARRIED A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS AGO. HIS NAME IS HAPPY, AND WE HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE TOGETHER. HE CALLS ME BEAUTIFUL, AND I LOVE IT. YEAH, IT IS A STRANGE TRUTH, BUT THE TRUTH IS I AM A HAPPIER PERSON. I AM MORE GROUNDED, MORE CENTERED, MORE CONNECTED AND INTEGRATED WITH WHO I AM AND GRATEFUL FOR WHO I AM TODAY. I'M WORKING WITH OTHER PEOPLE NOW AS A PRACTITIONER. I THINK THAT YOU CAN MAKE A CHOICE AND THAT YOU DO MAKE A CHOICE WHEN THINGS HAPPEN IN LIFE. OH, THIS IS FUN. I HAVEN'T JUST STOOD OUT IN THE RAIN IN QUITE A WHILE. HMM. THERE'S A GENERAL LAY SENSE THAT ALL ADVERSITY IS BAD. AND THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH DOESN'T REALLY SUPPORT THAT. ONE OF THE KEY INGREDIENTS TO HAPPINESS IS BEING ABLE TO RECOVER FROM ADVERSITY MORE QUICKLY. SO, IT'S NOT THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE HAPPY DON'T RESPOND TO ADVERSITY. THEY DO. THEY SHOW AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE TO ADVERSITY. BUT THEY COME BACK DOWN TO BASELINE QUICKLY. THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS PLEASURE WITHOUT PAIN, OF WHATEVER SORT, EMOTIONAL OR OTHERWISE, PHYSICAL OR OTHERWISE. YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM IS A DIFFERENTIAL ENGINE. IT LOOKS AT DIFFERENCES. IT LOOKS AT CONTRASTS. THAT'S ALL IT CARES ABOUT. IT INTEGRATES INFORMATION BY INTEGRATING A BUNCH OF LITTLE DIFFERENCES IN THINGS. WHAT DO YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE? UH, TO BE SUCCESSFUL, TO BE HAPPY, AND, UH, TO LIVE A LONG, HEALTHY LIFE. WHAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY? WHAT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE SUCCESSFUL AND HAPPY? UH... RIGHT NOW, MONEY. YEAH, LOTS OF MONEY. WE'RE TOLD IN OUR SOCIETY THAT THE WAY TO BE A COMPETENT PERSON, THE WAY TO BE A GOOD PERSON IS TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY. IN THE LAST 50 YEARS, ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS GONE UP A LOT. IN AMERICA, FOR EXAMPLE, WE'RE ABOUT TWICE AS WEALTHY AS WE WERE 50 YEARS AGO. THE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SURVEYS OF PEOPLE'S HAPPINESS SHOW THAT HAPPINESS HAS REMAINED STAGNANT. PEOPLE AREN'T ANY HAPPIER THAN THEY WERE 50 YEARS AGO, EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE LIVING IN A LOT BIGGER HOUSES, THEY HAVE MORE CARS. ANYBODY WHO SAYS, SHOULD GO TALK TO SOMEBODY LIVING UNDER A BRIDGE. BUT ANYBODY WHO SAYS, "MONEY BUYS HAPPINESS," SHOULD GO TALK TO BILL GATES, OKAY? NEITHER OF THOSE THINGS IS ACTUALLY TRUE. WHEN MONEY BUYS YOU OUT OF THE BURDENS OF HOMELESSNESS, OF NOT KNOWING WHERE YOUR NEXT MEAL WILL COME FROM, IT CHANGES YOUR HAPPINESS DRAMATICALLY. BUT ONCE YOU HAVE BASIC NEEDS MET, MORE MONEY DOESN'T SEEM TO BUY MORE HAPPINESS. THE DIFFERENCE IN HAPPINESS BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO EARNS $5,000 AND $50,000 IS DRAMATIC. THE DIFFERENCE IN HAPPINESS BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO EARNS $50,000 AND $50 MILLION IS NOT DRAMATIC. THE IDEA GOES BACK TO THIS NOTION OF THE HEDONIC TREADMILL, WHICH SAYS THAT WHATEVER LEVEL OF WEALTH OR MATERIAL GOODS YOU HAVE, YOU ADAPT TO IT AND YOU'LL ALWAYS WANT MORE. THAT'S WHAT THE HEDONIC TREADMILL IS. THE HEDONIC ADAPTATION IS ONE OF THE MAIN ENEMIES OF HAPPINESS. REMEMBER ROY BLANCHARD? HE TOLD US EARLIER ABOUT THE NOVELTY AND THE BEAUTY HE EXPERIENCES IN NATURE. WELL, ROY'S ALSO PART OF A FAMILY THAT JUST MIGHT BE ONE OF THE HAPPIEST FAMILIES AROUND. THE BLANCHARDS ARE AN EXTENDED FAMILY OF CHILDREN, SIBLINGS, AND IN-LAWS. MOST LIVE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF EACH OTHER. THEY LIVE MODESTLY AND WITH VERY LITTLE MATERIAL WEALTH, BUT THEY SEEM TO HAVE PLENTY OF HAPPINESS TO GO AROUND. IN ENGLISH, SOMEBODY TELL YOU SOMETHING AND YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT, YOU SAY, "CAN YOU PLEASE REPEAT THAT AGAIN? I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND IT." IN FRENCH, YOU SAY, "EH?" WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TOILET PAPER. WE HAD TO USE THE SEARS CATALOG. ISN'T THAT AMERICAN, THOUGH, USING THE SEARS CATALOG? THAT'S AMERICAN. AND HOW OFTEN DO YOU COME TOGETHER? OH, AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK. WE WERE ALL PLAYMATES. OUR PARENTS, THEY WERE THE PLAYING-EST PEOPLE. THEY'D PLAY MARBLES WITH US. WE SWAM EVERY DAY. EVERY AFTERNOON, THE WHOLE FAMILY'D BE IN THE LAKE SWIMMING. ALL THIS FOOD RIGHT HERE DIDN'T COST US A PENNY. YOU CAN FEED 25 PEOPLE FOR NOTHING. IF YOU GOT TO BUY ALL THAT, YOU ALMOST GOT TO BE RICH. BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE WAY WE LIVE. WE CALL IT "LIVE OFF THE LAND." HEY, THAT ONE IS GOOD. LET'S SEE. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17. ENOUGH FOR ONE PERSON. MY DADDY, HE WAS A CARPENTER. SOMEBODY NEEDS SOMETHING DONE, WE JUST GET TOGETHER AND WE DO IT. AND DADDY BUILT A LOT OF OUR HOUSES. WE DIDN'T HAVE NO PLUMBERS, ELECTRICIANS. THE FAMILY WAS ABLE TO PUT US A HOUSE TOGETHER. WE STUDIED SOME OF THE HAPPIEST PEOPLE, AND WE FOUND, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THAT ALL OF THEM HAD CLOSE, SUPPORTIVE FAMILY AND FRIENDS. THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT THEY LOVED EVERYBODY OR THEY GOT ALONG WITH EVERYBODY, BUT WHAT IT MEANT WAS EVERY ONE OF THEM HAD CLOSE FAMILY AND FRIENDS. WE MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN TWO MAIN KINDS OF GOALS OR VALUES WHICH PEOPLE MIGHT PURSUE IN LIFE -- INTRINSIC GOALS AND EXTRINSIC GOALS. SO, EXTRINSIC GOALS ARE EXTRINSIC IN THE SENSE THAT THEY'RE FOCUSED ON SOMETHING EXTERNAL TO YOU. THEY'RE FOCUSED ON REWARDS. THEY'RE FOCUSED ON PRAISE. THEY'RE FOCUSED ON GETTING STUFF. AND THE THREE MAIN EXAMPLES OF EXTRINSIC GOALS WE'VE LOOKED AT IN OUR RESEARCH ARE FOR MONEY, FINANCIAL SUCCESS; FOR IMAGE, LOOKING GOOD, HAVING THE RIGHT APPEARANCE; AND FOR STATUS OR POPULARITY. NOW, WE CONTRAST THOSE WITH INTRINSIC GOALS. INTRINSIC GOALS ARE INHERENTLY SATISFYING IN AND OF THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DO WITH INTRINSIC PSYCHOLOGICAL NEEDS THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE. AND THE THREE INTRINSIC GOALS WHICH WE HAVE STUDIED ARE GOALS FOR PERSONAL GROWTH, TRYING TO BE WHO I REALLY AM; HAVING CLOSE, CONNECTED RELATIONSHIPS WITH, LIKE, FRIENDS AND MY LOVED ONES; AND THEN COMMUNITY FEELING, WHICH IS HAVING A SENSE OF WANTING TO HELP THE WORLD TO BE A BETTER PLACE. WE FOUND THAT INTRINSIC GOALS ARE ON THE EXACT OPPOSITE SIDE OF VALUE SYSTEMS COMPARED TO EXTRINSIC GOALS, OKAY. THEY'RE IN OPPOSITION WITH EACH OTHER. THE OTHER THING WE KNOW FROM A DECADE OF RESEARCH AT THIS POINT IS THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MONEY AND STATUS AND IMAGE WERE REPORTING LESS SATISFACTION WITH THEIR LIVES, THEY WERE MORE DEPRESSED, MORE ANXIOUS. WE FOUND THAT THEY FELT LESS VITAL, LESS, SORT OF, ENERGIZED IN THEIR DAY-TO-DAY LIFE. ON THE OTHER HAND, INTRINSICALLY ORIENTED PEOPLE WERE MORE HAPPY. THEY WERE REPORTING MORE VITALITY, LESS DEPRESSION, LESS ANXIETY. IF OUR VALUES ARE A KEY COMPONENT OF HAPPINESS, THAT MAY EXPLAIN ONE OF THE ANOMALIES IN INTERNATIONAL HAPPINESS RESEARCH. ACCORDING TO AN INCREASING AMOUNT OF DATA, JAPAN IS THE LEAST HAPPY OF THE WEALTHY INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS. AFTER WORLD WAR II, JAPAN'S ENTIRE WORKFORCE WAS MOBILIZED TO REBUILD THE COUNTRY FROM THE GROUND UP. FOR DECADES, THEY EMPHASIZED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MATERIAL PROSPERITY ABOVE ALL ELSE, AND THEIR ACHIEVEMENTS WERE THE ENVY OF THE WESTERN WORLD. BUT THOSE ACHIEVEMENTS HAVE COME AT AN AWFUL PRICE. A TELLING AND DANGEROUS PHENOMENON IS OCCURRING IN JAPAN. PEOPLE ARE WORKING SUCH LONG HOURS AND ENDURING SO MUCH STRESS THAT THEY ARE LITERALLY WORKING THEMSELVES TO DEATH. IT'S BECOME SO COMMON, SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE DIED, THAT THEY EVEN HAVE A WORD FOR IT -- KAROSHI. THIS TOXIC LIFESTYLE IS LEADING TO RECORD-LOW LEVELS OF HAPPINESS AMONG THE JAPANESE. ONE SMALL ASIAN COUNTRY IS TAKING A DIFFERENT PATH. BHUTAN IS A COUNTRY WITH A FLEDGING ECONOMY, AND ONE MIGHT EXPECT IT TO FOLLOW ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT PRIORITIZE GROWTH, AS DO MOST DEVELOPING NATIONS. WHAT WE SAW WAS THAT IN THE PURSUIT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, PEOPLE AND SOCIETIES HAD LOST THE CULTURES, THEIR ENVIRONMENT, YOU KNOW, THE SOCIAL SYSTEMS, AND HUMANITY WAS HAVING PROBLEMS. THAT'S WHY BHUTAN SAID, "OKAY, THIS IS NOT ENOUGH, YOU KNOW? GDP IS NOT ENOUGH. HUMANITY NEEDS A HIGHER GOAL FOR DEVELOPMENT, AND THAT IS GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS." WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN BHUTAN IS INSTEAD OF TRYING TO MAXIMIZE GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT, THEY'RE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS. THEY'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS IT THAT'S GONNA MAKE OUR PEOPLE HAPPY -- NOT RICH, BUT HAPPY. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS CONTENTMENT, THIS HAPPINESS, LIES WITHIN THE SELF, AND THERE'S NO EXTERNAL SOURCE. THE FASTER CAR, BIGGER HOUSE, YOU KNOW, MORE FASHIONABLE CLOTHES IS NOT GOING TO GIVE YOU THAT CONTENTMENT. IT MIGHT GIVE YOU FLEETING PLEASURE, BUT NOT CONTENTMENT. GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE CITIZENS CAN PURSUE HAPPINESS. SO LET'S SAY, FOR EXAMPLE, BHUTAN HAS GOT LOTS OF POTENTIAL TO DAM UP ITS VALLEYS, SELL HYDROELECTRICITY TO INDIA. BUT WHEN THEY FLOOD THEIR VALLEYS, THEY HAVE TO MOVE PEOPLE. WHEN THEY FLOOD THEIR VALLEYS, THEY LOSE THEIR FOREST COVER, THEY LOSE SOME OF THEIR SITES OF SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE TO THEM. SO, WHAT THEY WANT TO DO IS THEY WANT TO BALANCE THESE THINGS. THEY WANT TO THINK, JUST, NOT, "OH, OKAY. DAM THIS VALLEY, SELL THIS AMOUNT OF HYDRO TO INDIA FOR THIS AMOUNT OF MONEY, GDP GOES UP." THEY WANT TO LOOK AT IT IN A MORE TEXTURED APPROACH. GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS IS IMPORTANT THAT IT MAKES US THINK ABOUT WHAT WE DO FOR OURSELVES AS INDIVIDUALS, OF SOCIETY, OF THE WORD, THINK RATIONALLY, THINK HOLISTICALLY, THINK SPIRITUALLY. IN TERMS OF ENVIRONMENT, OUR LAW SAYS 60% OF BHUTAN MUST ALWAYS BE FOREST. IN TERMS OF CULTURE, WE HAVE MONASTERIES, WE HAVE SCHOOLS TO BE PROTECTED BY THE STATE, WE HAVE RULES OF DRESS, LANGUAGE, ARCHITECTURE. SO THIS IS HOW THE GOVERNMENT IS CREATING THIS ENVIRONMENT. IF WE THINK ABOUT SOCIETIES, THE ULTIMATE PURPOSE OF SOCIETY SHOULD BE TO PRODUCE LONG AND HAPPY LIVES FOR ITS CITIZENS. THE PEOPLE OF BHUTAN HAVE ONLY RECENTLY BEGUN PURSUING GROSS NATIONAL HAPPINESS. AND TO KNOW HOW SUCCESSFUL THEY'LL BE, WE'LL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. ANOTHER COUNTRY IN A DIFFERENT PART OF THE WORLD CONSISTENTLY RANKS AS THE HAPPIEST COUNTRY ON EARTH. DENMARK IS KNOWN FOR ITS SOCIAL EQUALITY AND HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING. ALL DANES ARE PROVIDED FREE EDUCATION THROUGH COLLEGE AND FREE HEALTHCARE FOR LIFE. BUT DENMARK'S MOST UNIQUE AND REVEALING QUALITY IS THAT IT HAS MORE OF ITS POPULATION LIVING IN WHAT ARE CALLED CO-HOUSING COMMUNITIES THAN IN ANY OTHER MODERN INDUSTRIALIZED NATION. IN DANISH CO-HOUSING COMMUNITIES, MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVE ON A PLOT OF LAND OR EVEN IN A SINGLE BUILDING, WHERE CERTAIN CHORES AND BENEFITS ARE SHARED BY EVERYONE. WHEN I MOVED IN HERE, I WAS NEWLY DIVORCED WITH TWO LITTLE CHILDREN. I DIDN'T HAVE A WORK, SO I WAS KIND OF ISOLATED. IF I HAD TO MOVE IN A FLAT ALONE, I WOULD GO DOWN. I WOULD BE DEPRESSED. I WOULD ISOLATE. SO I THOUGHT I HAD TO FIND THIS PLACE. AND I FOUND IT. IT WAS A MIRACLE I FOUND IT. WE LIVE 20 FAMILIES TOGETHER. AND THE HOUSES ARE CLOSE TO EACH OTHER. THIS IS OUR HOUSE. WE LIVE FOUR PEOPLE HERE. AND OUTSIDE HERE, I HAVE A LITTLE EXTRA ROOM. IT'S LIKE A PLACE TO GROW FLOWERS, BUT WE USE IT AS A LIVING ROOM. THIS IS PAINTINGS MY CHILDREN MADE FOR ME. THERE'S AN EMPTY SPACE UP THERE. MY CHILDREN OFTEN ASK ME, AND I SAY, "IT'S BECAUSE I WANT TO SHOW YOU THAT WE CAN PUT UP MORE PAINTINGS. IT'S NOT FINISHED. IT'S A WORKING PIECE." AND HERE IS JULIANA LIVING. AND SHE HAS A LITTLE ANIMAL, WHICH IS ALSO A KIND OF SYMBOL OF OUR FLAT, OUR HOUSE, BECAUSE IT'S A VERY TINY ANIMAL, AND IT HAS A VERY TINY CAGE TO LIVE IN, BUT I USED TO TELL THEM THAT THIS ANIMAL HAS MORE SPACE THAN WE HAVE. 50 YEARS AGO, PEOPLE IN DENMARK ALSO LIVED IN COPENHAGEN, LIVED IN SMALL FLATS AND THEY HAD A LOT OF CHILDREN. AND THEY HAD A NICE CHILDHOOD ANYWAY, SO... IT'S LIKE A BIG FAMILY. YEAH. IT IS LIKE A BIG FAMILY. I HAVE FRIENDS IN THE SCHOOL, AND I HAVE FRIENDS HOME. IT'S VERY NICE BECAUSE I HAVE MANY FRIENDS. WE EAT TOGETHER, AND IT'S VERY, VERY NICE. I HAVE THREE CHILDREN, AND THEY EAT A LOT. IT HELPS ME A LOT BECAUSE WE EAT TOGETHER NEARLY EVERY EVENING. WE COOK ONE OR TWO TIMES A MONTH, EACH. IT TAKES FOUR, MAYBE FIVE HOURS. AND TO COOK ONLY TWICE A MONTH INSTEAD OF EVERY DAY, IT SAVES A LOT OF ENERGY THINKING, "WHAT IS THE MEAL TODAY?" TO BUY ALL THE STUFF AND TO MAKE IT AND TO DO DISH WASH, EVERY DAY IT SAVES, I DON'T KNOW, TWO HOURS AND A LOT OF ENERGY. IN THIS PLACE, WHEN WE GET 14, WE HAVE TO MAKE FOOD. SO, IT'S TWO GIRLS AT 14 COOKING FOR 40, 50 PEOPLE. IT'S REALLY COOL. AND THEY COME TO ASK FOR HELP, BUT THEY ARE VERY GOOD. THEY DO IT. EVERYBODY IS TALKING ABOUT STRESS, AND THE FAMILIES WITH SMALL CHILDREN HAVE STRESS BECAUSE THEY COME HOME FROM WORK, THEY HAVE TO BUY, THEY HAVE TO COOK. AND WHEN I COME HOME AND I'VE HAD MY SHOWER, THEN I HAVE TWO OR THREE HOURS WITH MY CHILDREN. I LIKE THAT THESE ELDER PEOPLE ARE LIVING HERE, BECAUSE THEY ARE KIND OF GRANDMOTHER AND GRANDFATHER FOR MY CHILDREN. I FEEL THEY LOVE MY CHILDREN AS MUCH AS I DO AND THEY ARE HAPPY WHEN THEY VISIT THEM AND THEY COME HERE AND THEY GET HUGS FROM MY CHILDREN. I FEEL IT'S A GIFT FROM ME TO MY CHILDREN TO LIVE HERE. SO, IT WAS A MIRACLE I FOUND THIS PLACE. IT SAVED ME, KIND OF, TO FIND IT, BECAUSE I NEEDED TO BE SURROUNDED BY OTHER GROWN-UPS, NOT ONLY MY OWN VERY SMALL CHILDREN. I HAVE LIVED HERE FOR 12 YEARS NOW. I'D GLADLY TAKE 12 YEARS MORE. I THINK WHEN WE WORK IN A COMMUNITY, WE REALIZE THAT, YOU KNOW, "MY LIFE IS PRETTY GOOD AS IT IS, AND I HAVE SOMETHING TO GIVE TO SOMEBODY WHO MAYBE DOESN'T HAVE SOMETHING THAT I HAVE." AND I THINK THAT MAKES PEOPLE SWITCH FROM FOCUSING ON, "WHAT DON'T I HAVE?" TO "WHAT DO I HAVE THAT I CAN SHARE?" AND THAT'S A VERY POWERFUL THING THAT WE KNOW FROM THE RESEARCH MAKES PEOPLE HAPPIER. WE ALL NEED SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES TO CARE ABOUT. AND FOR SOME PEOPLE, STRUCTURED RELIGION GIVES THAT TO THEM. FOR OTHER PEOPLE, THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT KIND OF STRUCTURED RELIGION, BUT THEY HAVE COMPASSION, CARING, GRATITUDE, AND THESE SPIRITUAL FEELINGS THAT CONNECT THEM TO THE UNIVERSE AND CONNECT THEM TO OTHER PEOPLE. NOW, ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS WE KNOW IS THAT NOT ALL RELIGIOUS PEOPLE ARE HAPPY AND NOT ALL RELIGIONS ARE HAPPY. IF YOU DO NOT OBEY THE COMMANDMENTS OF THE LORD, YOUR GOD, THEN HE'LL CURSE YOU. ACCORDING TO CHURCH LEADERS, HINDU RADICALS WERE OPPOSED TO THE EVENT AND BEGAN ATTACKING CHRISTIAN HOMES AND CHURCHES. THERE ARE CERTAIN CONDITIONS, ACCORDING TO JEWISH LAW, UNDER WHICH NON-JEWS MAY LIVE HERE. THIS DOESN'T APPLY TO THE ARABS. THEY DON'T FIT THE CATEGORY. THEY HAVE TO GET THE HELL OUT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE VERY FUNDAMENTALIST GROUPS WHO BELIEVE THAT EVERYBODY ELSE IS GOING TO HELL BUT THEIR GROUP, THEY'RE NOT HAPPIER. THEY'RE LESS HAPPY THAN OTHER PEOPLE. HAPPINESS ISN'T JUST ABOUT FEELING MORE BLISSFUL AND CONTENT. HAPPY PEOPLE TEND TO FUNCTION BETTER. THEY'RE MORE PRODUCTIVE, THEY'RE HEALTHIER, AND THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THEY EVEN LIVE LONGER. WELL, IF LONG LIFE IS AN INDICATION OF HAPPINESS, THEN THE PEOPLE IN OKINAWA, JAPAN, MIGHT JUST BE ECSTATIC. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO THE GUINNESS BOOK OF WORLD RECORDS, THAT'S WHERE A DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER OF THE WORLD'S OLDEST PEOPLE LIVE. SO, DESPITE THE STRESS AND UNHAPPINESS IN OTHER PARTS OF JAPAN, THE ISLANDERS OF OKINAWA HAVE A DIFFERENT STORY TO TELL, ONE OF LONGEVITY AND HAPPINESS. BESIDES EXPERIENCING FLOW ON A REGULAR BASIS, OKINAWANS GROW VEGETABLES THAT SUBSIDIZE THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND PROVIDE GIFTS FOR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS, BRINGING THE PEOPLE EVEN CLOSER TOGETHER. EVEN THE OKINAWAN TRADITIONS KEEP PEOPLE CONNECTED IN UNIQUE WAYS. THE ISLAND HAS A TRADITIONAL BAND OF ABOUT 50 PEOPLE, AND THE RULE IS THAT THE BAND MEMBERS MUST BE BETWEEN THE AGES OF 20 AND 30. THE BAND IS SUPPORTED BY COMMUNITY FUNDS AND PLAYS IN A DIFFERENT VILLAGE EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT. SINCE THERE'S NOT MUCH OTHER NIGHT LIFE ON THE ISLAND, LOTS OF PEOPLE COME OUT TO SEE THEM, BOTH YOUNG AND OLD. IT'S A TRADITION THAT ENSURES REGULAR CONTACT BETWEEN PEOPLE, NOT ONLY FROM DIFFERENT VILLAGES, BUT FROM DIFFERENT GENERATIONS. THE OKINAWAN ELDERS GATHER EACH AFTERNOON TO HAVE TEA AND TALK ABOUT THE DAY AT A LOCAL COMMUNITY CENTER. AND THOUGH NOW HOUSED IN A MODERN BUILDING, IT'S BEEN A STAPLE IN OKINAWAN SOCIETY AS LONG AS PEOPLE THERE CAN REMEMBER. SOCIAL BONDING, SOCIAL INTERACTION, COOPERATION IS PROGRAMMED TO BE INTRINSICALLY REWARDING TO HUMANS. THAT'S HOW WE INHIBIT OUR SELF-INTERESTS IN ORDER TO DO SOMETHING WITH SOMEONE. OTHERWISE, YOU WOULDN'T COOPERATE. YOU'D BE TOTALLY SELF-INTERESTED. WE DO NOT BEHAVE THAT WAY. WE'RE SOCIAL CREATURES. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WHEN YOU PUT PEOPLE INTO A SOCIAL EXCHANGE WHERE THEY'RE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO COOPERATE OR TO COMPETE, THEY WILL, IN GENERAL, COOPERATE WITH ONE ANOTHER. THAT COOPERATION ELICITS DOPAMINE SIGNALS THAT YOU CAN MEASURE IN THE STRIATUM JUST LIKE YOU WERE SQUIRTING JUICE OR COCAINE INTO THEM. IN OTHER WORDS, THE ACT OF COOPERATING WITH ANOTHER HUMAN CAN, IN THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES, FEEL JUST AS GOOD AS TAKING A DRUG THAT AFFECTS YOUR DOPAMINE SYSTEM. âª YOU CLAIM TO BE A PLAYER, BUT I YOUR WIFE âª IN A CULTURE THAT OFTEN ENCOURAGES COMPETITION INSTEAD OF COOPERATION... BITCH, I WILL PUNCH YOUR -- ...MICHAEL PRITCHARD HAS A UNIQUE WAY OF TEACHING KIDS ABOUT HAPPINESS. MIDDLE SCHOOL. ISN'T THAT A WONDERFUL TIME, WHEN YOU'RE ALL GOING, "UH, PFFT, UH, CH-- UH, UH, PFFT, WHATEVER! TALK TO THE BOOTY, THE HAND'S OFF DUTY. TALK TO THE PALM, YOU'RE NOT THE BOMB. LOSER, LONER, WANNABE, WHATEVER. NO, DUH, SHUT UP. I DON'T KNOW THINK SO. UH, I READ IT ON MYSPACE. SHUT UP." I LOVE 8th-GRADE BOYS ON THE PHONE. THEY GO, "UH. UH. OH. TIGHT, OH. OH, SICK. HA-HA. HEY, HEY, HEY, WHO IS THIS?" WELL, I'M UP HERE SWEATING LIKE BRITNEY SPEARS ON "JEOPARDY!" HOW MANY OF YOU EVERY DAY SEE A KID HERE WHO GETS ISOLATED, TEASED, PICKED ON, LAUGHED AT, AND HAS BECOME THE TARGET OF LOTS OF OTHER KIDS' TEASING AND BULLYING? RAISE YOUR HANDS, PLEASE. RAISE YOUR HANDS HIGH, HIGH. LOOK AROUND THE ROOM, PLEASE. LOOK HOW DISCONNECTED WE GET OVER STUFF. I MEAN, HOW MANY OF YOU GUYS PLAY THAT VIDEO GAME "GRAND THEFT AUTO: VICE CITY." YOU RUN OVER HOMELESS PEOPLE! YOU BEAT A PROSTITUTE TO DEATH WITH A TIRE IRON. YOU RUN OVER COPS, PARAMEDICS, FIREFIG-- AM I RIGHT? YEAH. YEAH. WE LOVE YOU GUYS. A GREAT TEACHER NAMED HELEN KELLER WAS ASKED, "OH, MISS KELLER, IT MUST BE HARD FOR YOU TO BE BLIND." AND SHE SAID, "IT WOULD BE IF I HAD NO VISION, BECAUSE WE REALLY SEE WITH OUR HEARTS." THINK ABOUT WHAT YOUR HEARTS ARE SEEING THAT SOMETIMES DISCONNECT YOU. THINK. AND IT CAN BE THE LITTLE WORDS, JUST THE LITTLE WORDS. I WAS A COACH AT A SPECIAL OLYMPICS. YOU EVER SEEN A KID RUN AND LAUGH? I WAS OUT THERE AT THE SPECIAL OLYMPICS. I HAVE A LITTLE 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO I'M COACHING. BOOM, THE GUN GOES OFF, AND SHE TAKES OFF RUNNING. WHAT A HEART. WHAT A SPIRIT. AND I HEAR KIDS SAY CRUEL THINGS TO HER. BUT SHE'S A GOOD TEACHER. SHE TAKES OFF RUNNING. SHE GOES, "YES! WHOO!" THIS IS NOT AN OLYMPIC-FORM RUNNER. SHE'S HITTING EVERY LANE. AND SHE GETS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE FINISH LINE 40 YARDS IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY, AND SHE STOPS. AND I WAS HER COACH. AND I SAID, "ANNIE, NO! COME HERE! YOU WIN THE GOLD MEDAL!" "NO, COACH." I SAID, "NO, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND! THEY'RE CATCHING UP! WALK TO ME! SNAP IT! COME HERE!" "NO, MIKE, PLEASE." AND SHE TURNED AROUND, AND SHE PUT HER HAND OUT FOR HER FRIEND, WHO TURNED AND PUT HER HAND OUT FOR HER FRIEND, AND THEN ALL SIX KIDS HELD HANDS AND CAME ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TOGETHER. AND SHE GOES, "WHOO! TOGETHER, WE ALL WOULD WIN. TOGETHER, WE ALL WOULD WIN." I KNOW THAT THERE ARE KIDS IN THIS ROOM WHO HAVE BEEN TEASED AND PICKED ON AND LEFT OUT AND ISOLATED. CAN I GET VOLUNTEER OF SOMEBODY WHO CAN SHARE WHAT IT FEELS LIKE? BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE. COME ON DOWN. I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU, SON. STAND IN FRONT OF ME. I'M PROUD OF YOU. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES. WHAT DO THEY SAY? I HAVE A DEPRESSION DISORDER AND ADHD. SO, IT JUST FEELS LIKE LIFE, IT FEELS LIKE IT SHOULDN'T BE THIS HARD. IT'S JUST, LIKE, EVERY DAY AFTER SCHOOL, YOU START CRYING FOR NO REASON. WHAT HAVE KIDS SAID TO YOU? NERD, LOSER, GAY, ALL THAT STUFF. WHAT HAS IT DONE TO YOUR HEART, SON? IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL REALLY BAD. IS IT FAIR TO YOU?! NO. IS IT FAIR TO ANY KID AT THIS SCHOOL? NO. STOP A MINUTE. NOT ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD, NOT ON THE BASKETBALL COURT, NOT IN ALL THE BEST ACADEMIC CLASSES OR LANGUAGES YOU HAVE WILL YOU SEE, BENICIA MIDDLE, SUCH COURAGE AS THIS. THIS IS THE COURAGE YOU SHOULD LEARN TO LOVE AND RESPECT AND HONOR. GIVE HIS HEART A HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE. THAT'S COURAGE, GUYS. WHO ELSE CAN SHARE? EVERYBODY KNOWS I'M JOEY. SO, I'M, LIKE, THE SHORTEST KID INSIDE THIS ROOM. NOBODY ELSE IS SHORTER THAN ME. SO EVERYBODY MAKES FUN OF ME. THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW, MAN! IT'S NOT FAIR! STOP A SECOND NOW, JOEY. HOW SHOULD WE ALL TREAT EACH OTHER? COME WITH THE LOVE NOW, BUDDY. COME WITH THE LOVE. COME WITH THE LOVE. HOW SHOULD WE ALL TREAT EACH OTHER, JOEY? WE SHOULD JUST FEEL HOW THEY FEEL AND TELL THEM, "THAT AIN'T RIGHT. YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING THAT." GIVE THAT A HUGE ROUND OF APPLAUSE. GOOD JOB, BROTHER. GOOD JOB. I LOVE YOU, SON. GOOD JOB. COMPASSION LEADS TO HAPPINESS. BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE! THIS IS THE BENICIA SCHOOL YOU GO TO. LET HIM KNOW! LET HIM KNOW THIS IS THE WAY YOU FEEL. THIS IS COURAGE. YOU GUYS ARE AWESOME. JOY COMES FROM THAT CONNECTION TO OTHERS. THE BEST THING WE CAN DO FOR A CHILD IS TO HELP THEM LEARN LOVE. WHAT LIES AT THE CORE OF A HUMAN BEING BEFORE MODERN CULTURE INFLUENCES OUR THOUGHTS ABOUT HAPPINESS? WHAT MADE US HAPPY BEFORE WE HAD VIDEO GAMES AND THE INTERNET AND TELEVISION? WHAT MADE US HAPPY BEFORE CARS AND ELECTRICITY? IN THE SOUTHERN AFRICAN COUNTRY OF NAMIBIA, THERE LIVES A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE GENETICALLY MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO OUR ANCIENT ANCESTORS THAN ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE ON THE PLANET TODAY. THEY ARE THE SAN BUSHMEN OF THE KALAHARI DESERT. THOUGH SOME MODERN CULTURE HAS COME TO THEM IN THE FORM OF T-SHIRTS AND BASEBALL HATS, THE BROAD STROKES OF THEIR CULTURE REMAIN INTACT. THEY GET MUCH OF THEIR FOOD FROM HUNTING GAME AND GATHERING ROOTS AND BERRIES. AND THERE REMAINS A FEELING AMONG THE BUSHMEN OF COMPLETE INTERDEPENDENCE WITH EACH OTHER AND WITH THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. THE BUSHMEN FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR EACH OTHER'S HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. SO WHEN SOMEONE GETS SICK IN THEIR VILLAGE, RATHER THAN SENDING THAT PERSON TO THE NEAREST DOCTOR, THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY, EVEN THE CHILDREN, PARTICIPATE IN THE HEALING PROCESS. NO ONE IS LEFT OUT. COMPASSION. RICHARD DAVIDSON TOLD US THAT PEOPLE WHO DO A SPECIFIC FORM OF MEDITATION ON COMPASSION AND LOVING KINDNESS CAN INCREASE THEIR HAPPINESS LEVELS TO A GREATER EXTENT AND FOR LONGER PERIODS OF TIME, EVEN THAN PEOPLE TAKING POWERFUL ANTI-DEPRESSANT MEDICATIONS. THERE ARE SPECIFIC MEDITATION PRACTICES THAT HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR MORE THAN 2,500 YEARS WHICH ARE EXPLICITLY DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE QUALITIES LIKE COMPASSION AND LOVING KINDNESS. THE PERSON WE'VE TESTED THE MOST IN OUR LAB IS A PERSON BY THE NAME OF MATTHIEU RICARD. HE HAS BEEN A TIBETAN BUDDHIST MONK FOR MORE THAN 30 YEARS. HE ALSO HOLDS A PhD IN MOLECULAR BIOLOGY. AND, UM, WE HAVE LOOKED INTENSIVELY AT MATTHIEU'S BRAIN, BOTH AT REST AS WELL AS WHEN HE IS INTENTIONALLY GENERATING THESE STATES OF COMPASSION. SO THERE'S NO OBVIOUS CHANGE IN EXTERNAL BEHAVIOR, YOU KNOW. HE'S JUST SITTING THERE. AND THEN WE GIVE HIM THE INSTRUCTION TO BEGIN THE COMPASSION MEDITATION, AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT'S LIKE PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE ON FIRE. THESE ARE AREAS OF THE BRAIN WHICH ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT FOR UNDERSTANDING HAPPINESS AND WELL-BEING. AND, SO, WE ARE, FOR EXAMPLE, CURRENTLY DOING STUDIES WHERE WE ARE HAVING PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER MEDITATED BEFORE AND WE'RE HAVING THEM DO VERY SIMPLE EXERCISES. TWO WEEKS OF TRAINING IN THIS SIMPLE COMPASSION PRACTICE DOES CHANGE THE BRAIN IN WAYS WHICH ARE SIMILAR TO, ALTHOUGH NOT NEARLY AS WELL-DEFINED, AS WHAT WE SEE IN VERY LONG-TERM MEDITATION PRACTITIONERS. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE TO INDICATE THAT WE ACTUALLY CHANGE THE GROWTH STRUCTURE OF THE BRAIN, LITERALLY THE SIZE OF PARTICULAR CORTICAL AREAS IN THE BRAIN CHANGE IN THEIR THICKNESS. WE, THROUGH INTENTION, CAN CHANGE OUR BRAIN. WE ASK PEOPLE TO COUNT THEIR BLESSINGS ON A REGULAR BASIS. SAY, EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT, YOU SIT DOWN AND YOU WRITE DOWN FIVE THINGS FOR WHICH YOU'RE GRATEFUL AND TRY TO CONTEMPLATE THAT. AND WE FOUND THAT THE STUDENTS WHO COUNTED THEIR BLESSINGS ONCE A WEEK, EVERY SUNDAY NIGHT, BECAME HAPPIER. A COUPLE STUDIES WE DID, WE ASKED PEOPLE TO COMMIT ACTS OF KINDNESS ON A REGULAR BASIS. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE GOING OUT AND THEY'RE PUTTING CHANGE IN PARKING METERS AND THEY'RE HELPING THEIR FRIEND WITH HOMEWORK OR WAS VISITING SOMEONE IN THE NURSING HOME OR, YOU KNOW, REALLY DOING REAL CONCRETE BEHAVIORS. AND IT SEEMS TO ME, FROM OUR EXPERIENCE, THAT THE ACTS OF KINDNESS SO FAR HAVE BEEN THE MOST EFFECTIVE. MOTHER TERESA, A SYMBOL OF COMPASSION, OPENED HER FIRST HOME FOR DYING AND DESTITUTE PEOPLE HERE IN KOLKATA, INDIA. ANDY WIMMER IS A VOLUNTEER AT THE HOME. I WAS A BANK AND COMPUTER MANAGER FOR MANY YEARS AND A QUITE AMBITIOUS FELLOW. I WANTED TO BECOME THE YOUNGEST BANK DIRECTOR THERE. SPOILED WITH A GOOD INCOME. I USED AND SPENT A LOT OF MONEY AND HAD A GOOD LIFE, ACTUALLY, ENJOYED THE LIFE. I USED TO WASTE A LOT OF MONEY ON FASHION, FOR EXAMPLE. I WAS QUITE A FELLOW INTO FASHION AND ALL THESE THINGS. BUT IT IS NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE. I ALWAYS FELT THAT THERE IS MORE IN THIS LIFE, YOU KNOW, THAN JUST GOING TO THE BANK AND HAVING A GOOD SALARY AND HAVING A GOOD CAREER AND MAYBE A WIFE AND CHILDREN, AND THAT'S IT. IT CAN'T BE A LIFE. IT'S SUCH A PRECIOUS AND BEAUTIFUL THING. THERE SHOULD BE SOME MORE, YOU KNOW? I MET SOMEONE WHO WORKED IN THE HOME FOR THE DYING, AND THEN HE SAID, "I'LL SHOW YOU THE PLACE, AND IF YOU LIKE HELPING US, THEN YOU'RE WELCOME." BON APPÃ©TIT. I REMEMBER WHEN I CAME FIRST INTO THE HOME FOR THE DYING, THE FIRST THING I SAW WAS A YOUNG DYING BOY, MAYBE 15 YEARS OLD, IN VERY BAD CONDITION, AND I HAD TO FEED HIM. AND I DON'T KNOW. I FED HIM, AND HE ATE WITH GREAT DIFFICULTIES, BUT THEN HE OPENED HIS EYES AND LOOKED AT ME. AND I THOUGHT, "SO, THAT'S IT NOW." YOU KNOW? SO, IT WAS LIKE A FLASH. IT WAS LIKE A SMALL ENLIGHTENMENT. YOU LEARN A LOT FROM THESE PATIENTS WE CARE FOR. FOR EXAMPLE, ACCEPTANCE, AND TOLERANCE, ALSO. SO, WE PICK THE PEOPLE UP, USUALLY FROM GARBAGE DUMPS AND FROM RAILWAY STATION PLATFORMS AND ADMIT THEM IN THE HOME. AND THEN, WITH BASIC MEDICAL CARE, WE TRY TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO SHOW THEM THAT THEY ARE LOVED BY GOD, THAT THEY ARE NOT FORGOTTEN, THAT THEIR LIFE IS PRECIOUS, THAT SOMEONE CARES. SO WE DO EVERYTHING BY HAND. BUT THERE IS A TREMENDOUS SWEETNESS IN TAKING SOMEONE'S BURDEN UP A LITTLE BIT. JUST TO LIFT HIS LITTLE, BENT BODY AND TAKE THAT BURDEN AWAY A LITTLE BIT AND HELP HIM TO CARRY IT. MY LIFE HAS A MEANING. YOU HAVE SOMEONE, A DYING MAN IN FRONT OF YOU, A DYING YOUNG MAN, AND HE ASKS FOR A GLASS OF WATER, IT'S JUST VERY LITTLE, BUT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO GIVE HIM THIS GLASS OF WATER. IT'S SUCH A SYMBOLIC ACT, EVEN, YOU KNOW? I GOT THIS LIFE. I GOT MY PARENTS, MY FRIENDS. I WAS NEVER REALLY SICK. I HAD ALWAYS ENOUGH FOOD TO EAT. I AM THE FIRST ONE IN MY GENERATIONS WHICH NEVER EXPERIENCED A WAR. FOR ME, MY LIFE IS LIKE A LOAN GIVEN FROM GOD. AND I WILL GIVE THIS LOAN BACK, BUT WITH INTEREST. AND THAT'S WHAT WE DO. YOU SERVE YOUR BROTHER IN FRONT OF YOU WHO IS IN NEED, AND IT GIVES YOURSELF A FULFILLED, HAPPY LIFE. PERFECT, NO? GRATITUDE, COMPASSION, CARING, LOVE -- THESE ARE TO ME WHAT I WOULD CALL SPIRITUAL EMOTIONS, AND THEY MAKE YOU THINK OF THINGS BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. IF YOU ONLY SEEK YOUR OWN HAPPINESS, IT CAN BE KIND OF A SELFISH THING. BUT ONCE YOU MOVE TO THE SPIRITUAL EMOTIONS AND WORRY ABOUT THE WELL-BEING OF THE WORLD, YOUR LIFE GROWS. YOU CARE ABOUT SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. YOU, IN A WAY, CAN TRANSCEND YOUR OWN LIFE, YOUR OWN DEATH, BY CARING ABOUT THESE THINGS THAT ARE BIGGER THAN YOURSELF. IF EACH OF US EVEN SPENT A SMIDGEN OF TIME EACH DAY ACTUALLY PRACTICING TO CULTIVATE HAPPINESS AND ALSO TO CULTIVATE OTHER VIRTUOUS QUALITIES LIKE COMPASSION AND ALTRUISM, THE WORLD WOULD REALLY BE A BETTER PLACE, AND WE'D ALL BE TRANSFORMING OUR BRAINS IN VERY POSITIVE WAYS. AND IT'S NOT ABOUT, "OH, I MUST CHANGE MY LIFE TOTALLY AND CUT OFF FROM MY PAST AND I'LL BE A BETTER PERSON." IT'S NOT ABOUT THAT. THE TRICK IS TO BE AUTHENTICALLY YOU. WE SHOULD REALLY BE THINKING OF HAPPINESS AS A SKILL, WHICH IS NO DIFFERENT THAN LEARNING TO PLAY THE VIOLIN OR LEARNING TO PLAY GOLF. THE FORMULA FOR HAPPINESS IS NOT THE SAME FOR EVERYONE, BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE THINGS WE LOVE TO DO ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF A HAPPY LIFE. PLAY. HAVING NEW EXPERIENCES. FRIENDS AND FAMILY. DOING THINGS THAT ARE MEANINGFUL. APPRECIATING WHAT WE HAVE. THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT MAKE US HAPPY, AND THEY'RE FREE. AND WITH HAPPINESS, THE MORE YOU HAVE, THE MORE EVERYONE HAS.
