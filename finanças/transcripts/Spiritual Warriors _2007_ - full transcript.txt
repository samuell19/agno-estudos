You're not goin” anywhere. - Well, you watch me! - /I owrt! - Tea time. Here you go. [Sighs] Sorry the tea took so long, but it takes exactly three minutes to steep, otherwise it becomes too acidic. Can we stop it with this tea thing? Let’s drink to that. Come on. Can we deal? [ Woman Chattering In Foreign Language] [Man] Yes, that’s it. That's it. That's it. Yes. Did you see it? What the hell was that? Just one of your many past lives. Did you put something in the tea? Lemon. All righty. Well, thank you for your exciting game. | gotta go. Stay a bit longer, Finn.

Or else misgrafted in respect of age— Hold it! Okay. What worked, what didn’t, and why? Wanna go? Well, | think we have a lot more work to do for sure. Yeah, for me, | felt— | felt it was working. / mean, | lubbed a line, but ] was on, | felt. Why’d you blow the line?

And the big roles | Jose to the big five— Esai Morales, Andy Garcia— - [ Professor] Oh, please! - Antonjo Banderas— Please. That’s a victim mentality. You know what your problem is? You won't make yourself vulnerable. You don't go near your real feelings. Great acting is about revealing, not concealing, and you're hiding. That’s what you do. You hide. You get up here. You play your idea of a character. You play your image. Nothing is real. You don’t have areal bone in your body anymore. Do you even know where the truth is inside yourself? Do you have any idea? Everything’s a joke. Go ahead, make a joke. Is this because | haven’t paid? [ Class Laughs ] Oh, isn’t that funny? Oh, isn’t that funny? [Finn] Hey, baby, can | get some water?

Total support while you screw your life up? | told Joe | quit! - Really? - Yeah. Well, how'd he react? I mean— It's not good. [ Woman] Claire, come on. Those arinks. Okay. Now. I'm making ‘em right now. All right, okay. I'll talk to you later. Um, | have to get back to work. [Sighs] Fine. / think the thing that really, uh, impacted me in my life was my father. He said that, uh— “Who you want to be with? You wanna be with me or with her?” And, uh— And | chose my mother instead of him, and | think that’s, uh— | think that hurt him and | think that’s, uh— | think that’s why | have problems... with, uh, like, a father figure or something... because | always felt that he pressured me to make the decision. And | feel— Sometimes | feel like / made the wrong decision. [Inhales Deeply] [ Exhales Deeply ] Hey, douiche bag. Hey, Joe. Jackie Chan you're not. Hey, Joe. What's up?

But like a son— They always start to rebel. | want out. I’m just asking you to back off. “Back off"? You want me to back off? I’ve been nothin’ but magnanimous with you. Now look what you make me do. So this is that tai chi stuff, right? Yeah. Helps you protect yourself. What did | tell you, right? There you go. Listen to me. You know what you're supposed to do. Everybody does. So why don’t you make it easy on yourself? You got that? Jackass! Jesus Christ. FEsai Morales. Can you believe jt? Remember him in that Richie Valentino movie? / really like that guy. Walk.

Such a beautiful color! Yes, it's been many, many years since these have blossomed... so radiantly. Yes. We need to talk. - Did you hypnotize me? - No. Why do you ask? Because after | left here yesterday, I've been having these nightmares. /'ve been having these, like, inner visions of darkness. -Is that all? - What do you mean, “Is that all?” - Amanin black is trying to cut my head off. -[Woman Gasps ] - What did his sword look like? - He had a red sword. - You are the one I've been looking for. - Say what? Tomorrow | leave for Egypt. You must come with me. Egypt? Man, you're crazy! You're crazy. | leave at noontime. Bring a passport. Look, man, you're a nice guy, but | gotta get back to reality, okay?

S0 you're saying that within two days of meeting this Roger, you go to Egypt with him just because he asks you? You know, when somebody talks truth to you, you go. / was afraid, and... he just pierced right through everything and touched my heart. Well, you said you had a girlfriend, Claire, who you expressed great love for... and you're saying you were lonely with her? Have you ever felt like you're lonely with people around you? | was lonely. | was dying inside. Every day | was dying. Dying. | was lonely. | was dying inside. Every day | was dying. Dying. [ Roger’s Voice ] In awakening the heartfelt energies, you can't help but discover your own self-worth, your own self-Jove, your own magnificence. We really don’t have the expression ofouterjoving... until our inner loving is there. [Finn] / had a dream about you Jast night. Are you really my father? [ Roger] Inmany lives | was, but this life js what matters now. Our journey to the Fast will awaken the light that is in you. Few can travel to the heart of spirit and remain unchanged. o' Man Singing In Arabic] Jd' [ Humming Along ] Roger, Roger, Roger. Listen to this thing. It’s so Egyptian. Jd' [ Humming, Trilling ] Finn, please. Keep quiet. I’'m-I'm trying to meditate. Jd' [ Humming ] JJ [ Trilling ] Thank you. | needed that. Yes, you did. Oh, God. Jt feels like /'ve been here before. This is so familiar. Well, you have been here before. How do you know? In the spirit, there are no secrets. Once you tap into the source, all things are known. | know one thing. I’m an out-of-work actor. Doesn’t matter what you do in the world. It's who you are in the spirit that's important. That is why you are here for your initiation. [ Roger, Pakistani Accent ] Would you like some tea? | don't understand why we're drinking hot tea when it's 120 frickin® degrees. Well, in Pakistan we are having a saying. “When it is very hot, we are drinking hot tea, and that will keep you cool.” No. No, thanks. [ Chuckles ] Well, maybe also you would want to consider a change of your clothings. Leave me alone. Not everybody has a collection of Hawaiian shirts like yours. [ Bus Driver] You go out. Search a minute, and you will find me here. Please don't come late, or/ will leave you, and you will come back on your feet. Enjoy your time, and happy visit to pyramid. Watch your step. Watch your step. Watch out. Here comes a step. [ Finn Narrating ] Climbing the great pyramid /s a long way from LA. [ Roger’s Voice ] You know, there’s a saying. “When people come here to see the sphinx and the pyramids, they discover the inner truth about themselves.” Napoleon came here. When he saw those magnificent creations, he had a sudden realization that his military career was going to end in defeat. In the very next battle, he Jost his entire fleet. [Grunts] [Sighs] Yeah. [ Rumbling ] [ Man’s Voice ] Look deeper, Finn. See what you see. Hey, who the hell’s talking? /am. The that which Js. [Gasps ] [ Roger, Normal Voice] You were being shown something very important. | don’t know when it will happen again. - That was you talking? - The me in you. You know, at first | didn’t want to come here, but now that I'm here, it's— It's amazing. Of course it is. | feel so little. In the words of John Wayne, [ Imitating John Wayne ] “Listen, pilgrim. It takes a lot of courage to find the truth.” [ Camera Shutter Clicks ] [ Roger] You see, spirituality is form/ess. Jtis the ook of the invisible, the sound of the inaudible. Ifyou think you know what spirit Js, that’s not what it js at a//. That is why spiritual warriors are not religious. What about all the leaders that, uh, started all the largest religions? Well, they themselves were nondenominational spiritual warriors. Then later, the followers would found a religion to preserve their teachings. ‘ But today, too many religions tend to polarize people and countries. Religions divide. Spirituality unites. What the hell happened to your accent? Well, Finn, you had this image that a spiritual leader... had to look mystical and sound British, so | fulfilled your expectations. so | fulfilled your expectations. [Irish Accent] You're gonna love this place, boyo. | tell you, it’s marvelous. [ Roger, Normal Voice] This is Akhetaten, also known as Tell el-Amarna. Where? It’s all around us, if you just look closely. Well, all | seeis a lot of rocks and sand. Well, this is the home of one of the great mystery schools... where spiritual warriors were trained... under the leadership of the great pharaoh Akhenaton, father of Tutankhamen, husband to Queen Nefertiti. And it is where you will receive your initiation. Now, when you were a lad, you prayed and prayed... for the very thing you are going to receive now. Do you remember what it was? Yeah. To be loved. To have a family. God was listening. Now, go through the temple... and | shall meet you on the other side. This way? [ Roger] Strajght ahead. Jd' [ Humming ] Go.

It was here. | died here. Spirit is trying to show you something, Finn. |- cant tell you. It would inflict on your consciousness. Why do we have to keep seeing the past? You will never be given anything that you cannot handle. [Laughing] A little more exciting than Disneyland, isn’t it? [ Moans ] I’'m hot and sweaty. It's real hot. I’'m burning. [ Finn’s Voice] And, uh, | got on a plane with him, man, and we went, and it was a great experience. And | will never forget that. [ Female Therapist] This experience you've described— /t has some amazing symbology, but what did it mean to you? | felt like— like the person | always wanted to be. It’s like | was looking back, looking at the person that opened up... going, “Wow. | didn’t know | can be like that. | didn’t know | can feel like that.” | was falling in love with everybody. Jt was like being outside the box, Jike the world is— The world is trapping you, but this is like you're— You're just, like— Ahhh. You know? You're just, like— Ahhh. You know? [ Roger’s Voice ] Fach relationship you have with another human being... lives primarily inside you. /fyou place it in the worla, you will experience difficulty. There js no relationship out there.

No e-mail. | thought you were dead! | was, okay? | was. A part of me did die. | don't know what happened to you, but you forgot about me. It's like you don't even care anymore. That’s not true! What is true? Whoa. Ali Baba. What, are you a Muslim now? - What, are you out there making pumice? - Hummus. Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Buddhist— JE’s all the same. You know, if it wasn’t for this public place, /'d take that tablecioth and wrap it right around your neck. [ Woman ] 1'm sitting next to my baby and 'm in the hospital. [ Man] Where is your baby? My baby is in the incubator, and, you know, they were doing that thing. They were suctioning the baby next, and they were going— Um, whatever that word is they say when they're trying to get the heart to go again. And, um— And— How little is the baby? [Crying] -Sorry I'm late. - Finn! Sit down! You interrupted an emotional-recall exercise. -You made a scene in the middle of class. - I’m sorry about that. That was rude of me. But I— - And what the hell are you wearing? - Oh, shit! Wow! / can see your aura. It’s big. JE’s bouncing off the walls here. Okay. | want you to understand something. I'm your coach. /'m not your therapist. You take a break from class. | can’t work with you anymore. [ Roger’s Voice ] You were being shown something very important. / don’t know when it will happen again. [Gasps ] [ Chuckles ] What’s up, bro? [ Panting ] Joe was my brother. Joe was my brother back in Petra. He got me killed. Good. You're finally getting your own answers. So what do | do about that? Figure it out yourself. Right. All right. Uh— By the way, don’t be so mean to Claire. [ Chuckles ] How do you know about Claire? | never mentioned her to you. Well, if you don’t want somebody reading your mind, keep it empty. [ Chuckles ] | like what you've done with the place. Last time | was here, we were watching— what— the Laker game? Back then, you were a nobogy. And funny thing is... you're still a fuckin’ nobodly. Yeah, that’s the problem, Joe. I've been listening to you way too long, and it’s gotten me nowhere. I’'m surprised you're doing your own dirty work. This time it’s personal. I"m protected, Joe. My spiritual teacher won't let anything happen to me. [ Chuckles ] What about Jesus? God didn’t protect him. Hmm? And, uh, Moses? What— He walked the desert for 40 fuckin’ years and he never saw the promised land. We're not doing the same thing anymore, Joe. You know what the funny thing is? You, of all people, gettin’ religion. Hey, but you're in good hands. How many millions of people were slaughtered in the name of God? You don’t scare me, Joe. Okay? Hmm? You and me— We were brothers in another lifetime. We don’t have to do this anymore. Roger warned me about you. Roger? Who the fuck is Roger? Why, you dirty rat bastard. | love you, Joe. | love you.

Just Claire. / kept seeing my life with her. But there was nobody there. Just her. That's love. [ Roger’s Voice ] The moment inside of you where you forgive what's happenea, jtis the moment where you are enlightening yourself. [Claire] / wrote something for you. [ Beeping ] “You couldn’t look me in the eyes. “Don’t want me to get the wrong idea. “| do have a history with you. “You mean a lot to me. “I'm not quite sure who... “I am to you... “or what | mean to you, but...
