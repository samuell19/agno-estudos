Pippi on the Run Pippi! Pippi! Hello Mr. Nilsson. Have you seen Pippi today? I wonder where she went. Can we wait here to wish good night? No more buns. Tommy, we can bake new buns for Pippi, okay? - We'll do it! She likes fresh bread. - Surely all people like it! - Tommy, can you light the stove? - Sure I can. Help, there's a fire! Imagine if the entire Villa Villekulla caught fire. Oops, now it's seconds! Wait, I'm coming to save them! - Where does it burn the most? - On the stove! We were going to bake buns for you, but we must have roasted them a bit too much. Well, a little too long, but we can bake others. No... Where are the children? This is ridiculous. What did you say? Said where are the kids? This is ridiculous. - They're at Pippi's house, understand? - They could be punctual, right? Yes yes. Yes, I'm happy Yes, I'm happy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday Yes, I'm happy. Yes, I'm happy all week We were supposed to be home by eight o'clock! Come on, Tommy! Now don't you come too soon. Goodbye, Pippi! See you tomorrow. - Hello... Have you eaten yet? - We don't usually eat at eleven o'clock. - Oh, is it so late? - Yes. You can't go to Pippi if you don't have time. - We forget ourselves... - It's easy to say. - Now I'm tired of it. - You complain all the time! - I don't, I don't complain? - Yes, you complain! - Do I complain all the time? - Yes. - You don't care? - No. You read all the time! What are you reading? Don't forget to brush your teeth. "When We Run Away" is what it's called. Don't forget to brush your teeth. I am not going! Wow, how much fun they had in the book. Don't forget to wash your neck and ears. Running away is exactly what you should do to escape all the irritation! Little old man! Come then! Come on, old man. Come then. - Isn't it good bread? - You have a caterpillar there. - Careful! - Disgusting animals. - You usually say good morning. - Good morning. Look, my dear. We don't read while we eat. - Look, here comes Pippi! Hello. - Hello! No, now I have to go or I'll be late for the office. - Pippi, maybe you want a sandwich? - No thanks, I already ate. - What are we going to do today, Pippi? - I know. Tommy and Annika must clear the strawberry fields. - We can do it another day, right? - You say that all the time. Couldn't you come up with something worse? They must be cleaned, otherwise they will grow back. I'm not going to lie there cleaning when the weather is so beautiful! What got into you?! Take the pitcher. It shouldn't be there. And go get new milk. It's nothing to be sad about. - You keep barking and barking! - No, but not me, right? I will... Yes, I will. I will run away from home. You? Are you going to run away? You do not believe me? Then you will see. Wait, Annika! I'm coming with you. Bye mom. Now we run away. It's great to get rid of them. Excellent? You don't know how sad you are when you fight with your children. - Pippi, they really won't run away, will they? - It's good for children to escape. So you can rest in the meantime. You don't know what it's like. - Maybe I should run away with them. - Yes, please Pippi, do it. I know you match them so well. Can you take care of Mr. Nilsson? I'll bring it when we leave. But, Tommy... Where do we go when we escape? - And if Pippi doesn't want to come along - And now? Didn't you go too far? I thought you'd already walked around the stable three times. - Pippi, you can come and run. - I run away? Why? - I don't have a strawberry country. - Not funny otherwise. - Please Pippi! - OK then. So we got big sandwiches. Now you can behave like in better houses, not like in Villa Villekulla. - Here I go with Mr. Nilsson. - Then I'll let him into the house. - Is there any risk of him escaping? - No, not him, no. Be a really cool monkey now. Goodbye. So I trust you to take care of them. Attention with Mr. Nilsson. He can be quite tricky to deal with. The crystal crown indoors! Oh dear! Get down! My new curtains! Mr. Nilsson, you shouldn't run on the piano! Grandma's vase! - You didn't bring any gold coins. - You have to manage without money. - It works? - It works. The whole world is full of people who has no money. Mama's little dog said you must believe I'm fine Although you know, not today, I'd rather do it another day Mama's lazy puppy said that nobody can do it as well as me But if you think like me, I'll do that another day Tralllallalalala, tomorrow I'll do it All your long day yeah, ow, ow, ow, what should I do And if you see, therefore, I must take it easy today Well, because today is not going well, I'd rather do it another day Tralllallalalala, tomorrow I'll do it All your long day yeah, ow, ow, ow, what should I do Yes, because you see the lazy dog ​​of the mother said that I like to work well But you think like me, you do Like me, I'll do it another day Your mother wrote that poem, didn't she? How fun is that! I don't think we'll be on any adventures. We must hope for the best. Stop! Look how many strawberries! Look! What fun! I've never seen any badgers before. And you who thought we wouldn't join us for some adventures. - Here! - Thanks very kind. Yes, I'm happy Yes, I'm happy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday Yes, I'm happy! Yes, I'm happy all week Yes, I'm happy! - Which way should we go? - Let's flip a coin. - Do we have any money? - Yes, a penny. Well, let's go there. It looks like a one-way street. - Are we really going to take it? - If the coin chose, let's follow. Ugh, it's probably going to start raining soon. In my book, it was beautiful weather. Where are we staying tonight, do you think? Yeah, there's always somewhere. That's the only sure thing. Here there may be a wonderful castle, with some counts who will be very happy when we arrive. - Wonderful castle, that! - Shall we live there? Kinda old! Listen, old man, it's not dangerous! Come back! - He certainly doesn't want to run anymore. - What should we do now? - Without the horse, we can't escape. - What if he runs away. He runs home and keeps the coffee hot for us until we get home. Come on, we can't sit here. - Ew! Pippi, I'm scared. - Hold me by the apron strings. Someone is ringing. It must be a ghost! Or an angel who escaped from heaven. I am scared! Whoever's inside, I'll probably look them in the eye. Tommy, come back! - Hello! - Hello. Welcome. Sit on the sofa or, if you prefer, in the armchair. No thanks, I'd rather sit in the rocking chair. It's a nice old chair, that one. Yes, I noticed that. - What weather we have. - Yes, there may be thunder. Yes, I believe so. What is your name? My name is Konrad, for my part. That's not our name. My name is Pippi and this is Tommy and Annika. Little Annika is so scared her heart jumps in her chest. Are you afraid of me or of thunder? Both. I can't guarantee thunder, but I'm not dangerous. I'm just a small traveling salesman. I'm no more dangerous than a sow. - What is a traveling salesman? - The one who goes around doing business. - What are you selling? - And yes... Tricks that aunties buy, right? Little trinkets, trinkets? I'm selling Konrad's Kalasklister! If you get stuck in that glue, you'll never break free. - He adheres inexorably. - I might as well try. Just be careful not to get caught in it. Konrad's Kalasklister is a universal remedy. Wash with it and china never needs to be washed again. Wall with it and you can blow up the house if you want to demolish it. Stick with Konrads Kalasklister and you won't go anywhere. Feed the chickens with the glue and you will get unbreakable eggs. Konrad's Kalasklister is the best! Here comes Pippi Longstocking climbing, hoop hello, hoop climbing the wall Here comes Pippi Longstocking... I knew it was good glue, but not that it was that good. Tommy and Annika! Look here! - That was hard. - Be careful not to get stuck. No. Watch out, here I come. Now I know how flies feel! Indeed, such a climate we have. Imagine if we had no weather at all. Oh, how beautiful it is with thunderstorms. I also think. What do you think, Annika? I think it's disgusting! - Pippi, now I'm hungry. - Yes, exactly. Now we have to eat. What is that? I'm stuck on my own tail! That is not what I said? Konrad's Kalasklister adheres inexorably! - Who spilled glue on the window frame? - I made it. Yes, yes... Done is done. Maybe I can take it away. - No, the beard grows along with the root. - Then you should see the barber. It's better than walking with a window hanging in your beard. This glue is so strong. There's a piece, you. There. You said something there. - How cozy we are. - What a good sausage you have, Konrad. Wish I could get one like this with pickles? Thank you for that. So are you running away? I'm too. - You escaped from a prison? - No. Have you ever? I save a little bit every day because I think it's more fun somewhere else. Here, for example. Here, for example, and you, for example. Huh? What are you doing? I'll probably wash your ears. No, but... Thank you very much, but is it really necessary? You probably need this more than I do, honey. Goodnight. Plop! Plop! - Plop! - Plop! Plop! Plop... - Plop! - Plop, plop! Plop, plop! - I forgot to wash your ears. - Yes, sometimes you get lucky. Promise me you'll wash them tomorrow. - You sound like your mother. - Why should I wash my ears? I do not want you to go there on the roads, lonely and dirty. He's not going to be any more lonely for this, is he? By the way, I don't walk, I ride my bike. You can be clear in the ears for this. We'll see about that, miss. I either wash the ears or leave them alone. You'll never find out what he's doing. We will probably never see Konrad again. Phew Fabian! I think this is sad. Plop, plop! Plop... Yes, Annika... Now I'm going to get up before you wake up and wash my ears. Konrad! Come back! I won't wash your ears. Oh, he can't hear. Well, we'll never see him again. But we still have glue! Pippi, the mile-long road ends here so we have to go back to the crossroads. - If the coin chose, it has to go. - Yes but... That's where you're going anyway. But... how are we going to get down here? - Then you see that there was no road. - Everything will be fine. Good thing you have Mojäng with you. Throw away the backpacks, let's go. Why don't we scale with Kalasklister? It's going so well anyway. If one of us falls, we all fall. I stick like a leech on the mountain. Gee, could have flipped another coin. Help! Pippi! Help! Take it easy! Try to cling to the mountain. - So you can't stay there, can you? - No, that's not possible. One fine day, you'll probably die laughing! Just hold on tight. I'll go down with you two. Yes, I'm happy Yes, I'm happy Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday I'm happy! Yes, I'm happy all week How will it be? Do we have food or not? Be quiet, you're scaring the fish. - Tommy, what the hell! - Oh! Look! Mama thought we should stay at home and clear the field of strawberries. - Look, we ate everything! - Oh really? What is it then? It's the best thing. If you think like me, if you think like me, I'll do it another day You should have seen it when I went down Niagara in a barrel like this. - Now you lie again, Pippi. - No, I can show you how I did it. - Pippi, never mind! - It's not dangerous at all. - You better not! - Close the lid and stop mumbling! No... Good! Put me in now then. Come on, Annika. We'll have to see where it ends up. Here it is! We'll never catch her. Mama's little one likes to ride, it's fun when he runs away And I'm still going here and I'm still going there and soon the whole barrel smokes Pippi! Do you see the barrel? No, it's gone. The son of a bitch would leave and go now, so it'll be quiet and peaceful Wonderful, I feel as good as possible It's actually not bad. Oh! It's getting shallow, I think. Jump! It's better to look around. Anyway, it was fun! Too bad Tommy and Annika couldn't come along. Tommy and Annika! I must have gone a little too far. Tommy and Annika! Jump! We will never find her. Don't say that, Annika. Now I stay here, close my eyes and count to ten. When I open my eyes, Tommy and Annika are right there. Because I want to! I want! Hey... what if Pippi stepped on land across the river. Tommy! Annika! Tommy! Annika! Tommy! Annika! No... Tommy, maybe we can sleep here. Annika, come! Look! Oh, I would like to pet them. Wait, Annika. They might be afraid of us. Where is Pippi? We will never find her. We'll starve to death, I think. It's the last sandwiches. I'm dead tired. I want to sleep. Maybe under that Christmas tree. Seems pretty good. Oh, how sleepy I am. There! - What is it, Annika? - Ants! Go and lie down on an anthill yourself. Then you will die laughing! We were going to sleep in that barn. Maybe we can find our way back there. Is it wise to go to bed when others are gone? Don't do it again, Pippi. Get out and look. It's very warm and pleasant here, I must say. Come on, you can feel it. If they went down the river, they must come out of the forest. And then I need... Yes, exactly that! A bike to ride and explore. - Good to be out of danger. - Now we have to try to get home. - We're hundreds of miles from home. - We will starve several times. I'm so hungry. - What are you doing? - Trying to restore. I have to get a bike to ride around and look. To search for? But what do you have to look for? I have to track down a couple of kids. We only have one penny. No problem. You can get this junk for free. Look! Cabbage Dumplings! Fried chicken! Cabbage dumplings that are so delicious! Fried chicken! Think, huh... - And pork pancake! - Why would we run away from home? - Pippi... Pippi! - Tommy and Annika! Pippi! Where have you been? A little bit everywhere, everywhere. - Where did you get all this? - I would make a bicycle for myself. - Glad we met! - Yippee! - Listen, we're stopping traffic. - Come on, right now! But Pippi, you can't ride a bike without wheels. I didn't think about it. Silly, huh? - Pippi, I'm fainting from hunger. - We have to get money. In a deep and endless black forest with clouds where thunder struck there were a couple of small children once throughout the day Yes, that day the sky was dark and the forest was crowded The children in their solitude went and cried They wept and thought that we will never see our father's dwelling again here in the darkness cold and needy will be the death of us Just when so desperately the moon was waning... Get going! Aren't you supposed to let me sleep in peace?! Go ahead! Just when I was in such despair, an angry man appeared there Shut up and disappear! And he immediately gave me a shoe, would you believe it Two! Look, it's the same size as my old ones. - Thanks, I needed some new ones. - Stop there! Give me back my shoes. What is that?! Here with the shoes, I said. If you threw them away, you can pick them up yourself, old man. Just when he was so desperate, he still had his shoes on Now no one can take them from you. - Cabbage fritters... - Fried chicken... Pork Pancake... - Oh, how wonderful to escape! - Yes, although it is difficult to walk. There are other ways to get there. Take the train, for example. Tommy and Annika, hurry! Jump! Pippi, I'm scared! Trains are the safest means of transport. - Don't you think it's funny? - Well, it is. And now I want to sing that summer is beautiful - And the trees are so beautiful - And the ground is so green And the flowers are beautiful and the hay smells good And the sun is so sunny and the water is so wet And the little bird flies in and out of the nest And so I want to sing that the summer is mine I also want to sing that butterflies are good And all the fluffy mosquitoes I want too And I'm brown on the legs as it should be And so I want to sing that brown legs are good And I have new freckles and summer blotchy skin And so I want to sing that the summer is mine - Look, Pippi! - A tunnel. It is better to lie down on our stomachs. And now I want to sing that summer is beautiful And the sun is so sunny and the ground is so green - What do you look like! - And you! Excuse me, could you tell me what time it is? Hello? That was weird. How it is? Are you not well? No, I must be very sick. A lot of hay! It's much nicer to ride a load of hay. Jump! No! Ohhh! Stop, stop! No, don't eat gravel, Nils-August. Who do you have in charge? I don't have anybody there in charge, do I? Yes you have. Three strange children! Who let you ride the load? Make sure you stop by! We didn't have time to ask, but it was nice to meet you. We already have enough children here on the farm. It's lucky for you, that. Much longer we cannot stay and cheer him on. - I don't think he likes us. - He can't help but do that. Hey you! Can we sleep in the haystack? Yuck! Don't you understand what I'm saying? We already have enough children here on the farm. They seem to be strange children. But that little guy certainly needs to practice walking. Hello. - Hey you. - Wow! Wow! wow! Such a cute child you are. - Stay here tonight, then. - Thank you, that was kind. But tomorrow you can leave again. Okay. - What are your names? - Kalle, Olle, Frasse. - And his name is Lasse. - What's his name? We call him Pisse-Nisse, but his real name is Nils-August. - He's not up for it, poor guy. - Ugh, how dirty he is. Health, health - I'm flying! So you can't do that, can you? It doesn't work. No, no, but it's fun anyway. Now we must sleep. - Imagine the three of us lying here. - Together again. Silence, someone is coming. Imagine if it was a ghost. - Goodnight! Are you out and about? - We have milk and rolls. Mom said we should go here with him. Your mother is good at baking. The buns are right on point. - It's good to have mothers, isn't it? - Cool! - Kalle curses when her mother doesn't hear. - It's ugly to curse. You should have listened to Bernard Janson. He cursed so that flames came out of his mouth. They were such terrible words that the old man fell and died. - But you didn't die, Pippi! - No. I know a terrible swear word. Do you want to hear? I whisper so the boys don't hear. I can not hear! You tickle me, Tommy. Tell about it. - That wasn't bad. - You want to hear my worst? Oh, you're not bad, Kalle. This is instructive. You are not lost. Frasse and Lasse, then? I can say "honey". Should I say this? I don't want to be here! You don't have to cry because you can't swear. You will learn this over time. By the way, swearing is ugly, but I can swear. Do you want to hear? Yes, it will be very interesting. - Well, what was the worst? - Annika's was great. I can't dirty the air here, but I can scream out the window. Beetle rolls shit! Hey, won't you go to your mother's house? Well, isn't it? Hey you! How cute you are... but so dirty. I'll wash you a little. Will you be happy then? Now you will be clean and beautiful, understand? Don't you want to be clean and nice? Listen, come back! Stop then! I like you. Because you have such small and cold feet. Tommy! Come up here and make breakfast. I'm really hungry. What do we have? Cold chicken and pork pancake. Kalle! Wait for us! - They left... - They could have said goodbye, right? - That Pippi was a little crazy. - She was crazy. Let's go guys. Here's a great view. You can taste the pancake. Oh, daddy is coming. He doesn't like us being on the roof. - Oh! Is the bull in that pen? - Dad must have forgotten about that. He is very angry. Be sure to get off the roof! The roof can't take it. - Don't you understand that it's dangerous? - Dangerous? Just look back. Hello, Daddy! Wow! Watch out, Piss-Nisse! Hello. Hello... Piss-Nisse! Listen, bull! Hello! Hello! Don't get so mad. Be careful! Though I don't have horns, but I can be very fatal anyway, believe me. Hello! Don't just stand there and look stupid! Piss-Nisse! - Hello Pippi! - Can the bull kill her? Pippi is the strongest in the world. Hello! What did you say? Are you tired now? Do you go home and go to bed? You go. Anyway, do it. You saved his life. - You want something for it. - It was a pleasure to help. Look, Pippi! What a nice car. - It hasn't worked for two years. - Look great. - You want? - To want? You are crazy! - Am I really understanding? - Yes, but you can't get him out of here. You can come here and play with him. Tommy! Annika! I have a car. Thanks! Out with all the mess. Hurry, Annika! We'll be done soon. Pippi, you put water in the gas tank. Excellent rainwater! Extra prime - better quality. Can the car also not drive? We will also mix it with Kalasklister. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Let's go. Thank you for letting us sleep in the haystack. Come back! Come back! Children cannot drive! Of course. But this is Pippi Longstocking. Remember this. - Brake, Pippi! Brake! - It's not possible. Konrad's Kalasklister will be a colossal success. He must have put dynamite in the glue. - The backpack fell, Pippi! - I take. Pippi! - Brake, Tommy! - It's not possible. You do not know? Hey Pippi! Faster! Faster, Pippi! Well done, Pippi! Listen up, all you car guys! Give your old cart a shot of Konrad's Kalasklister. Then she starts to gallop! Jump at a gallop! Hello how are you! Soon we will take off, I think. - Help... - What did I say? Look, we fly like eagles! Pippi, how are we going to get down? Yes, it always happens somewhere. We go down a little and look around. Careful out there! Hey, downstairs! Have you never seen a flying car before? Pippi the mountain! We drive straight to the mountain! Down, down, up, over. Down, down, up, over. Can't you knock a little? It goes too low. OK. Hey, what a rustle in the leaves! Here we are. What if we fall, then? Konrad's Kalasklister works great. What do we do when Kalaskalistret is over? Right. What are we going to do, then? Land, of course. - We can land up there. In the field. - OK let's try. - No, that doesn't work! It's not possible! - Down, down, up, over! But this, Pippi? No, it must have been a little late. Up, up, up! We take off! Look, Annika. It is very good. - Oh... - Help... Careful! There goes the spare parts. Get down, I said. Here comes more! - This is going well, Pippi. - Right. Fuel is running out. Flap wings then! It's not a good idea. What are we going to do, then? Yes, we can land right there. - I'd like to swim. - Pippi! Hey Tommy and Annika! Oh, I'm very weak in the knees. You were afraid? You didn't have to stay. It was Pippi who drove. What did I say? We landed in the middle of a beach. What a success! To jump! Go swimming here! - It's good in the water! - Cool! - Aren't you going to shower too, Annika? - Now you will see the big laundry room! I will not wash at all. You have to wash up sometime. How good it is in the water! Jump too, Annika. You become such a fool when you run away. You must also wash yourself. So that, then! Pippi and Tommy, now it's your turn. Sit down, then. No! Not in the eyes! Annika, you will probably become head of the sanitation agency one day. Oh, help! No! Despicable you! Now you! Now it must be over. We don't have a car, so we have to keep walking. Hey look! Someone took our clothes! Do not look! - I shower with my clothes on. - What shall we do, Pippi? We can't get naked, can we? Are there empty bags here? Do you have time to wait an hour? There are some at the bottom of the pile. - Do you mind if I help? - No. Here comes Pippi Longstocking alê hello, hello jump... jump! What do these two represent? They are a landlord of Egypt. We need money to buy clothes. Yes, because I don't want to walk around like that. We can sing in backyards again. Then we can sing something really sad! Something even sadder than Just when I was so desperate. They must feel sorry for us, but also that we are brave and courageous. I'll put on a show that will make them cry blood. I swear! - Look at these poor children... - Who don't have clothes. Look at these poor people children without clothes And they have no father and almost no mother left Oh food, they haven't eaten that for over a fortnight But guess what they have Well, they still have their temper! Lira lara loppa, fool and glam and tournament The pea, the pearl and liver pâté The house in the bush in kili-koli-koli-fej Lira lara loppa trick, hey! Throughout the day these poor children are scolded To lubricate every night and eternally mosquitoes and whine Oh, everything they have to do with it is a fairy tale Oh grandma is not nice but they sing anyway: Lira lara the flea, fool and glam and tournament The pea, the pearl and liver pâté The house in the bush in kili-koli-koli-fej Lira lara loppa trick hey! - What difficult people. - And petty. 17 bucks isn't enough for a shirt sleeve. There may be other places here! Hello, ladies and gentleman! Do you want to see something that make your eyes roll out of your skull?! It only costs a crown to see the best linden dancer in the world! Like I said, the best dancer in the world. Pippilotta, Virtualia Rolgadina! Krusmynta Efraimsdotter Longstocking! Come and see if you dare! Hello Hello! I will start soon! If you has tranquilizers, take them now! - Good job! - It costs a crown to watch. A crown! Thanks. - It costs a crown! - A crown! - It costs a crown! - A crown! Hello! A crown. Otherwise you have to close your eyes. Now, ladies and gentlemen, here I come! - Oh! - Is there anyone who can stop her? Not wise. Now you close your eyes! Yes, I'm good but then you would have seen granny. She could walk a tightrope! They drew a line between the church steeple and the town hall tower and said: "Fia, can you walk the tightrope?" Grandma climbed the rope, 90 years old. She walked back and forth between the towers. She barely had time for coffee. "Yes, Fia, now we see you can walk the tightrope," they shouted. By this time, she had been at it for five or six hours, but she didn't give up. She rubbed, back and forth. "Come for coffee," they shouted. But Grandma didn't want to come down. She lifted her right leg and poked her nose with her big toe. It's hard to pick your nose with your toe. Grandma knew how to walk a tightrope, she! I can only do this, and only this. Hey Hey! Now what kind of crowd is this? - Oh, oh, oh! - The police didn't pay! It costs a crown to watch. All dancers must apply for a license. - Where are you from? - From home. Do your parents know about this? Well... I'll have to deal with that. Hello! To jump! La la! - What a cute sweater! - Yes, shopping is done here! - Clothes for 78.95, please. - Here's some more. - It looks really good on you, Annika! - Yes. Stop there! I'll have a serious talk with you at the police station. What have we done? It is forbidden to dance on a rope, and also dangerous to life. I have to talk to your parents. It will be tricky, but you can try. You must stay here while I investigate whether you've run away from home. I have to arrest you. I'm sorry, but I have to make sure you don't go. The two fit together all the time, so you have to be careful with them. By the way, would you like a caramel? You like caramels too, don't you? Thanks. - Thanks. - Then! - Goodnight. Sleep well! - Bye Bye! - See you again soon. - I don't think so. Unfortunately. That was a strange cop. The caramels! We leave them to other children on the run. Tommy! Annika! How many hours did we walk? Eternities. I have annoying shoes. I'm tired, hungry and sad. We should have stayed in jail. We should have stayed home instead. Look! Konrad! Who thought we'd meet him again. How cute he is when he sleeps. I wonder what I look like when I sleep. Like a child sleeping, roughly. Dude... eh! What a surprise! You are here? It was fun. Hello! Annika thinks you're cute when you sleep. - Do you have any food? - No. It's like that when you're on the run. Sometimes you have food, sometimes you don't. What a great broom! I'll take it home with me. Probably needs sweeping at Villa Villekulla. If you were a witch, you could fly home. - Or you can ride a horse. - It's the old man. Yes! - Now we have to go home. - Come visit us sometime. Come to Villa Villekulla whenever you like! Then we can purchase glue from you! Is it time to come now? How happy I am to see you! Yes, I'm happy. Yes, I am happy. Yes, I'm happy… - Listen! Aren't they coming? - Yes, of course it is. Mom, now we're back! Tommy and Annika! - Welcome home! - It's good to be home! Yes, now they finish escaping. Where have you been? We've been waiting so long! - Mr. Nilsson! - Glad they're home! You must be happy to see Pippi again. How hungry you must be! Pippi, won't you eat? One sausage, only. I have to go home. - Thank you for your help. - You're welcome. See you tomorrow! Mom, tomorrow we are going to clear the strawberry field. - Do you have new clothes? - Yes, a cow ate the old ones. What? A cow?! Yes, one with a tail and horns. Muu! You haven't been out of the woods, have you? Goodnight darling! Sleep well. Oh! Sleep well! Until tomorrow, huh? - Bye, Annika. Sleep well. - Goodnight! Pillow, how good you are! What a pity for Pippi who has no mother and father. Now it's not raining anymore. Probably because we're not running anymore. Pippi! It wobbles a bit before you get used to it. Wait until you clear the land of strawberries, so let's live! You can't fly on a broom, can you?! Well, of course it works. It works! It works! I can do everything-everything-everything!
