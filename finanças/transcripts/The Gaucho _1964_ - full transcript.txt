How ridiculous. - It's inconceivable. - A shame. -He went crazy. - Cast the director of the bank. And this summer in the Jockey Club? And when 2 years ago .... Mario del Monaco came to Buenos Aires? The engineer needed a week of clinic. There he made us lose a business with the Americans. Watch this. These green carnations fade. What crap. It ruined my tuxedo. He is crazy.

How beautiful is song. Good engineer, good voice. Now someone will tell us a few words. No, what am I going to say? Thanks friends, I am also moved. Because for me this song too ... how to say... ... it was a breath of Italianness. Very good engineer, bravo. Like an Italian ... ... only here he made money. Because money is important. It is not to joke. He did it here but remember ... ... to Italy, Naples, Vesuvius ... ... unlike many unfortunates ... ... that not only did nothing ... ... but they always cry misery. Maybe just to them ... Saint Lucia does not give a damn. They have no sensitivity. That's why now I propose that you grant us ... ... a good bis of Santa Lucia. Sing, sing engineer. Give me the pleasure From the heart You've been fine, Marco. The engineer sings well, huh. Clear. Is rich. Let's go. His latest role. Engineer, how he filled us with gifts. What gifts?
