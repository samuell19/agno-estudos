I understood I also wanted to do a partnership with you. How not? Beggar Society and Co. Luckily I have the trip paid. If not, I had to stay. No, we have a bed. Clothing no. In Olivos you did not have a place? Come, ma'am. Come with the red. He says that since there was no light in the basement ... What basement? The basement is this one. Is that to go down there to make an effort. What other output do you have left? Did you see the poor cat what was down? He is afraid? - Red. - Whiskey I'm sorry for her. Poor girl, she had Excited so much ... Anyway... You did not get married for interest. Do not. - Stefano, I ... - You go? Yes, this festival does not give me respite. But you call me. Or I call you.

I should invest a capital of 2 million. That is, what should get 2 million. What does it say? Do I do well? The money invested here It never gets lost. Because. How do you say? That would be perfect if they had a little more salt. Look, I did not talk much ... But you, by chance ... ... would I anticipate 2 million? 2 millions? At the change, 400 thousand pesos, $ 3400 The capital here can be doubled. Yes? With more reason, so. It's just about getting there to an agreement soon ... ... I go back to Rome ... ... I withdraw the capital of my bank ... ... I pay you and I transfer ... ... with my wife and my son that here they would be happy. Delighted. Magnificent, that's how I see him more often. Followed, no. Everyday. - Always here. - But tell me... Is your partner active? Very active So why do you need 2 million in advance? Pay attention.

I allowed myself to pay the hotel account. - Mine? - Everyone's. I was offended? He will think I'm ridiculous. But he does not know what they were for me these days. Although embittered by gossip. - Wild gossip. - What happened? An anonymous letter An anonymous letter? - Things that in Italy ... - I do not understand. What does it say? Evils about you and my wife. Framework... From Italian to Italian. From man to man. Look me in the eyes. No, look at me Is not true. Engineer ... do you think that Do you have horns? I knew it. How ridiculous. - It's inconceivable. - A shame. -He went crazy. - Cast the director of the bank. And this summer in the Jockey Club? And when 2 years ago .... Mario del Monaco came to Buenos Aires? The engineer needed a week of clinic. There he made us lose a business with the Americans. Watch this. These green carnations fade. What crap. It ruined my tuxedo. He is crazy. Do not fall in love we're leaving. The engineer made a lot of disasters for us. He got thrown out of the Jockey Club ... threw the director of a bank ... ... and messed up the tuxedos with the colors of the motherland. Who were you calling? To Cecilio. Comes? They say it is not there. He went to Bariloche for a week with friends. To fish trout. Go figure... Sorry. Seriously. I hoped that at less to you Argentina ... bring you luck. Sorry. But what do you feel? I do not understand. Did you think I was going to marry that Cecilio? In my life I had more proposals of marriage... ... what headaches. I always rejected everyone. I was not going to accept that thing. True, handsome was not. His hand was sweaty. Every time he wanted to give me the hand gave him the fascist salute. - I saw you. - You did not lose anything. Last night I went because ... to have fun. I thought to tell him. "How am I going to marry you?" - "What do you have?" - Clear. "You're talking to Luciana." It makes me angry not to be able to tell him in the face ... ... because he left. I do not know why these cretins have a little money and they think ... I do not know what they think ... I do not know. Luciana, maybe it's too late. Tomorrow we're leaving. Tonight I leave my room, the one you liked. I was a little bad. Come on, let's have fun. Courage. Does he always sing? How beautiful is song. Good engineer, good voice. Now someone will tell us a few words. No, what am I going to say? Thanks friends, I am also moved. Because for me this song too ... how to say... ... it was a breath of Italianness. Very good engineer, bravo. Like an Italian ... ... only here he made money. Because money is important. It is not to joke. He did it here but remember ... ... to Italy, Naples, Vesuvius ... ... unlike many unfortunates ... ... that not only did nothing ... ... but they always cry misery. Maybe just to them ... Saint Lucia does not give a damn. They have no sensitivity. That's why now I propose that you grant us ... ... a good bis of Santa Lucia. Sing, sing engineer. Give me the pleasure From the heart You've been fine, Marco. The engineer sings well, huh. Clear. Is rich. Let's go. His latest role. Engineer, how he filled us with gifts. What gifts? Things of Argentina ... ... and engineer Marruchelli. - Thank you. I did not have to bother so much. And the passages? Ah, Marco has them Where is? Framework! All ready? There is nothing missing. As we arrive we leave. The passages, each one his. Now it has arrived the time to say goodbye - Thanks, Luciana. - Goodbye, engineer. Lorella, you and Mara travel as tourists. What's wrong, engineer? Courage. Marruchelli! It will seem ridiculous, but I am moved. Why ridiculous? It's more... I regret that these days in some moments ... ... even last night ... ... I was a little bad .... I have my faults What are you going to do? It's natural. There is no Italian without defect. And you Marco is very Italian. Engineer What do you do? Cheer up! Be careful. Excuse me, but do not tell me they will let go. Have it better. Do not forget us Come on girls, it's getting late. - Goodbye. - Do not put the horns on us. Thanks for everything. The engineer almost had tears in his eyes. - Almost? I was crying. - Poor. Who arrives? The Italian singer Celentano. - The San Remo festival. - Celentano? - Yes sir. - Please! Where is it going? He is a madman. Giving me a call! I do not understand! If you want to come to Italy ... ... I send you the money for the trip. What does it say? I do not hear.
