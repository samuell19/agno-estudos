I don't do this a lot. Neither do I. So, have you been doing all right? I'm sorry, that was a silly question. Of course not. No, it's okay. I've been fine, all things considered. Of course, it's hard with two daughters, and... I still miss him. It still feels like a dream that he's dead. You probably don't wanna talk about this now. It's actually kind of nice to talk about it. It's been over a year, and no one even says his name. So... Wish I knew him better, you know? I wish I got to know you better. I mean, we barely spoke in high school, right? Yeah. Crazy how we bumped into each other. Well, you two probably would've been friends. Mm. Yeah, he was a really great guy. An amazing husband, a wonderful father. Wow. You know, my mom died a few years ago, my father before that, so I know what you're going through. Yeah. This is probably a heavy conversation for a first date, right? Just a little. So I'll see you at church on Sunday, right? Yes. But I've got a babysitter until midnight. Oh, okay. So guess that means I get to hang out with you a little longer.

Are you okay if the girls and I stay for a while? Girl, I have had enough. I can't do this anymore. Okay, I will. Maya, please. Nope. Don't wanna hear it. I can fix this. Ian, I have had enough. I'm done. Maya, I'm not the only one who's fallen apart. You've fallen apart too. You've struggled and I've helped you, baby, I've helped you get through it. Are you gonna go there with me? I was depressed because I lost my husband, but I got my life together. You, on the other hand, can't seem to do that. Baby, all right, look, look, look. I just need a little more time, okay? I'll go to the program. I'll go get help, baby. I want to be better. I just need a little more time. I told you I am done. What part don't you understand? Baby, look, I, I love you. I love you, and I love your kids, baby. Look at me. Baby, I want to be a real family, okay? There's nothing more that I want than a real family, okay? I'm, I'm going to go to the program. I'm going to get help. Baby, look at me. One more chance, that's it. Ian, you have had enough chances. What else do you want from me? How many do you want me to give you? I have trust you, you have violated my trust. What do you want from me? Baby, just one more, okay? So, I was waiting for the right moment. The right moment never came, so, you know, that's all, that's all my fault. Love you so much. I'm sorry for everything that I've done. Maya, I'll go get help, I'll do whatever I need to do, but I can't lose you. I can't. Baby, I am no good without you. I'm no good alone, baby. We've been through so much, so much. Baby, please don't give up on me now. Please. You don't make me regret this. One more chance. But you have to promise me, promise me no more drinking and no more gambling. I mean it. Okay. I'm serious. Mama. Mama? Mama! Oh, God, baby. What's wrong? You wouldn't wake up. Oh, Mommy's so sorry. I must have overslept again. Look, why don't you head downstairs and I'll meet you in a minute, yeah? Can I have a kiss? You got on my favorite PJs. Ow. Ow. Noelle, Grace! Maya. Oh my God, Ian, you scared me. What are you doing home? I left work early. I decided to take a shower here. What, what are you doing? I don't know, what does it look like I'm doing? It looks like you've lost it. Funny. No, the nanny starts today, so I figured a little extra security couldn't hurt. You know, since Mama's going back to work full time, she needs to keep an eye on her babies. I get that, but, baby, you worry too much. All right? Come on now, you stay with a cop, you live with a cop. Not to mention the sexiest cop in the district. Oh my God. I'm all the security you need. Girl, what do you think she's gonna pull? Well, first of all, she was the only nanny available, so that's telling you a lot. And I've never left a stranger with the kids before. Right, I get that, but you're still worrying too much. And that looks a little creepy. That doesn't look creepy. Baby, that, that's a little creepy. Can you take it down, please? Fine. Thanks. God. Look, I'm, I'm gonna go change, okay? All right. And promise me one thing? No more weird stuff, at least while I'm gone. It wasn't weird. No, that was pretty weird. My wife. I'll be back. Hey, and here is the kitchen. Oh, nice. And here we have Noelle, and this is Grace. Hi, girls. Hey, Ian. Ian, this is Elle. Elle, Ian. The new babysitter. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Have we met before? I mean, you look familiar. I don't think we've met, but Maya gave me the full rundown. You have a beautiful home. Thank you. What's their usual bedtime routine? Anything you want me to do? We don't usually start bedtime stuff for another hour or two, but if you want, you can go with the girls to their room and you guys can get to know each other. - Okay. - Yeah? All right, girls, what do you say? You wanna show me your room? Yeah. Noelle and Grace, such beautiful names. All right. How's your day? Oh, don't you mean how was my morning? I've been so exhausted lately that I slept through a meeting with the principal. Maybe you shouldn't go in now. Honey. Look, we agreed that when the girls were of age, I would go back to work. You said that you were okay with that. I know, baby, but sometimes I think you put too much pressure on yourself. You just need to take it one day at a time. Maybe you're right. How's work going? Mm. I talked to the Chief today. And? And they are promoting your boy to Lieutenant. Finally. Oh, baby. You know, it's not settled yet. They still have to push through some paperwork and everything, but it's safe to say that I will be on my best behavior for the next few weeks. Well, you have nothing to worry about. Oh, boy. Well, I guess we gotta have something a little fancier than nuggets to celebrate that big promotion. And I could think of one way to celebrate. That's right, I have the perfect present in mind. A little prince. A son to carry my name. Baby, I told you I am done with diapers. I have a career that I love that I wanna get back to, and here you are trying to keep me barefoot and pregnant? Would you stop it? Call me Lieutenant. No, no, no, no. Have you been drinking? Oh, gosh. Come on, baby, it was just one drink with the guys to celebrate. And look, now it's our turn to celebrate, okay? No. - Just one drink. - No. - Just one. - No, Ian. We know how this thing goes, it's a cycle. One drink goes to the next, goes to the next, and here we are back at square one. Baby, you have a big promotion on the line. You can't jeopardize it. Okay. All right, I'm, I'm sorry. We just have to find a safer way to celebrate. Baby, I already told you. I can think of another way we can celebrate. Come on. Please. Oh, baby. Baby, grab a condom. Ian, honey, come on, please, grab a condom. You're betting again? Oh God, I can't believe you. Baby. ♪ Baby, we both just lit the candle ♪ ♪ Place it up, that's when it's stable ♪ ♪ I know the stakes are high ♪ All is fair in love and strife ♪ ♪ Come Oh, coffee's ready. Thanks, Elle. Morning. Good morning. Hey. I gotta make a call with the principal. I thought you slept through that meeting. Mm-hmm, but he was very understanding and we rescheduled. Well, that was nice of him. Look, I might be late coming home tonight. They have me out on patrol all week, okay? All right. So, I'll see you later. Okay, I'll see you later, babe. Have a good day. Oh, I can only take one cup. I can't be late when I'm up for a promotion. A promotion? Well, that's wonderful. I'll be Lieutenant any day now. Well, maybe I shouldn't get my hopes up too high until it's official, but... I'm sure you're gonna get it. Maya told me you've been at the station for, what, 10 years? Right? Yeah. You're like a local hero. Give me too much credit, Elle. I gotta get out here. All right? Welcome to the family. Grabbed your mail again. They really should put the boxes further apart. Thank you. So you have company over? Yeah, new nanny, my wife's idea. Quite the looker, for a nanny. Have a good day, Mr. Stocklan. The cab's on its way, so I'm having a little pre-drink. Girl, of course I don't drink in front of Ian. I've got a secret bottle stashed away for special occasions. All right, see you soon. Who was that? That was Megan. Oh. Oh, honey, I'm so sorry, I just- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, babe. Listen, I made dinner reservations at your favorite restaurant tonight. But, honey, I told you I was going out tonight. Baby, I know, but I just wanted to surprise you. Look, I'm tired of the rift between us, all right? And you'd be happy to know that I'm meeting with my sponsor in the morning. Baby, I just wanna be perfect for you, for the family. Honey, that is so sweet, but can we do this tomorrow night instead? No, baby, come on. Look, I just wanna spend a little more time with you before you go back to work, all right? Listen, we still have a chance, all right? You've been tired lately, and baby, I never get to see you. So I wanna see you tonight. The point is, I promised Megan that I would go. Okay, so what I'm hearing is that you'd rather spend time with your little friends than stay home with me, right? What, are you trying to avoid me, Maya? I'm not trying to avoid you. Really? We never spend any time together. No, because every time we do, all you wanna talk about is having a son. Honey, I have told you a million times that I don't want another baby, especially not with someone who keeps on lying about their drinking and gambling. Look, Ian, you are an addict. So what you're saying is you'll have another child, just not by me, right? Honey, that's not what I'm saying. I'm trying to say that I don't want another kid, period. But what about me, Maya? Huh? Why do I never get a say? You're always telling me what to do, but you never listen to what I want. Ian, I am not trying to tell you what to do. I'm just asking you to stop drinking and gambling our savings away. And if you think that's me being controlling, then I'm sorry to say it, babe, but you're delusional. You don't get to speak to me like that. Calm down. I'm going out. Let me! I'm your husband. You don't get to just walk out. Ian. We can talk about this tomorrow. Please. You know what? Fine. Do what you want. Oh. Oh, baby. Looks like your friends are gonna miss you tonight. Oh my God. All right, what happened? Man, I left my phone in the office. Gotta go back inside. All right. I'll wait for you, huh? All right. Hey, I'm Liz, Deputy Chief. Hi. Do you need help with something? I was hoping that someone can help me out with this situation that I- Maya. Hey. Hey, baby. What are you doing here? I thought you were on patrol today. I was, but I left my phone here. I'm sorry. I know how much you hate being a traffic cop. Oh, I know you've been forgetting your lunch a lot lately, so I decided I would bring you something just in case. Thank you, baby. Okay, I'm gonna leave. Wait, wait, wait. Are you sure you're doing okay? Yes, honey, I'm fine. Wait here. It's nice to meet you. Ian talks very highly of you. Thanks. That's sweet of you, bringing him his lunch. It's no big deal. Yeah. My phone number. In case you ever need it. Are you sure you're all right? Baby, I'm just going to go ahead and take you home. Chief said it's all good. He's gonna send someone else out. Honey, I told you that's not necessary. I'm just going over to the store. Baby, it's no big deal, all right? Besides, that's for the best. You look a little tired anyway. I'm gonna go change, all right? Chief'll keep you company. His daughter's in the music class. What you over there doing? You reading? Yeah. Was there something else you wanted to show me? Come, come. Oh, okay you want me to see something else? Let's go, all right. Oh, what do you want me to see? Can we play with my dolls? Your dolls? Of course we can play with your dolls. Is that your doll house? Yeah. Show me how you like to play with your dolls. All right, I'll be right back, sweetheart, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Stay right here, okay? What about your car? I'll bike in tomorrow and pick it up. What were you doing there, Maya? Can't a wife do something nice for her husband? No, seriously, what do you think you were doing, just showing up at my work like that? You know, I've just been anxious lately and I missed you. You know, sometimes you forget your lunch, so I figured I'd bring something by the station. Elle's home with the kids, so... Ian, I'm sorry about yesterday. You were right, we don't spend enough time together, just the two of us. It's okay. You sure that's everything? I talked to the principal and he said there may not be a budget to where they can hire me back full-time. In fact, they may be getting rid of the music program altogether, so... You know how bad I've wanted this, Ian. I was just, I was upset. But I knew you were the person to cheer me on. Baby, I'm sorry to hear about that. Wait, I thought your meeting with the principal was yesterday. Yeah, but I let them borrow my music stand, so I had to go back and pick it up. Would you mind stopping at the grocery store? Elle said she needed a few things for dinner tonight. Can stop by there later. Don't worry about that. Hi. Hi, little lady. I'll be back downstairs in a second, okay? What you doing? I'm planning a surprise for your mommy and daddy. They're gonna be really happy about it, okay? They're gonna be so happy. But you have to keep it between me and you, just for a little bit, okay? You can't tell them I was in here. A surprise? Yeah, like a surprise party! Right? So, this is our little secret, okay? Noelle? Is that me? Can I, let me see, let me see if that's you. Hold on, let, can I see it? Give it back, Noelle. Give it back. Noelle, let me, okay. Noelle. This isn't funny, Noelle. Give it back. Ow, you're hurting me! Give it back, I need it. I need that back. Come here, I'm sorry. Are you okay? You okay? I gotta get back to work. Babe, you need to rest. You seem a little off. I know, but if they keep the program, I've got a lesson plan due. You wanna go play? Yeah, you do. Come on, let's go. Let's go play. Remember I showed you that? Let's go play. Elle, girls. We need to talk. Ian, I am busy. Babe, we need to talk now. God, do you not understand what busy means? But you have to promise me. Come on, pinky promise that you won't say anything to mommy or daddy. We don't want daddy to get mad, right? All right, promise. I promise. Nice. What's this? Who did you show this to? I didn't show it to anyone. What is wrong with you, Maya? What's wrong with me? What happened last night, Ian? You wanna tell me why I've been sleeping so much? Why I have no idea how I got into the bed last night? I know that you put something in my drink. If you show that to someone, you will destroy our family. You have already destroyed our family! With all of the gambling and the drinking and now this? You didn't give me a choice, Maya. You're being selfish. I've adopted your kids and what did I get, huh? You know how much I want a son. A family, baby, a son to be able to pass something down to, just like my dad did for me. That's exactly what this world needs. Another drunk trying to deal with his demons. I thought you were different, Ian. What you have done to me, what you have done to my kids? I just want a son. A perfect family, baby. Don't touch me. Hello, I'd like to report a disturbance. You disgust me. Wait, what did you say? You think you're the only one to be able to gather up evidence? What if the wrong things ended up in your purse or your car? Or maybe in your system because of a drug-laced drink. Huh? I am going to be a lieutenant. And baby, you already know the influence that I have, the people that I know. Who do you think they're gonna believe? We're married, Maya. And I'll have custody of the kids if anything was to happen to you. And then maybe then I'll find a real woman who can gimme the family that I need, that I deserve. Baby, if you try to run, I'll find you. You remember what happened last time, right? Cops pulled you over and they brought you right back home to me, to Daddy. You know it could have ended up very differently though, right? You will never escape me, Maya. Ever. My reach is too long. This right here? This is your problem because you're always holding on to things that haunt our family. He was a better man than you will ever be. I thank God every day that those kids are his and not yours. I hate you. I want my son. Ian. Mommy! Oh, hey, baby, hey. Is everything okay? Yeah, yeah. Maya just broke a glass. So, baby, watch your foot. It's okay, baby, everything's fine. Why don't you take Noelle back outside while we clean up in here? Where's Grace? She's in her room. You want me to go get her? No, no, no, I'll take her. I'll grab Grace too, 'cause I gotta go to the store anyways. I'll help clean up. Let's let Maya clear her head. No, no, Noelle can go. Grace can stay right here where she is. Here with Daddy. Okay, I'll stay and give Grace her bath. What's going on over here? Is everything all right? Hernandez, you know there's a reason why they refer to it as a call in. I'm not calling you in. We received a call from one of your neighbors. Something about a disturbance. You know, me and Maya, we just had a little spat. I mean, you know how it is. No, I don't. Can I come in? So, where is Maya? That's your wife's name, right? She went to the store. Is this really necessary? We have to follow through with any calls we receive. You know that. Liz, Liz. Always doing everything by the book. That's me. This way. Liz, this is our nanny, Elle. Oh. Are you here to chat with the soon to be Lieutenant? I wanted to talk to Maya actually. Do you know when she'll be back? No idea. Sorry. Is there a problem? One of the neighbors called, probably heard the scream when Maya dropped the glass. You know how clumsy she can be. Glass? Right, the glass. Sounds like it's gonna be a long shift. Apparently. I gotta go. I'll see you tomorrow. Thanks for stopping by, Liz. It's always a pleasure. Hey. I'm about to put the kids down for a nap. Miss Grace won't sleep until you sing the alphabet remix. Ah, she will be coming after your job soon. You seen anything interesting? Are you all right? Oh, Maya, are you okay? Here, let me, let me help you. Come on, I got you. Sorry. You okay? Yeah. Just haven't been feeling so great these past couple days. Something like a stomach bug? Yeah. I guess so. Hey, Elle, don't worry about it. I don't think Maya's gonna be eating with us anyway. You know, she's not feeling well. She'll probably be down for the rest of the night. Plus the kids already ate, so... Well, I don't mind cooking for you. And I could eat. Maybe we just have dinner together, if that's okay with you. Sure. All right. Go relax. I'll take care of everything. I did, I used to play. I was really good. No. - Yes, I was. - No, you weren't. Yeah, you should believe me. Don't I look like a basketball player? Like, look at my arms. You don't. I work out. And I definitely, definitely can shoot some hoops, so... Don't tell Maya about this. What? Of course not. Thank you. I haven't had the chance to get to know you yet, so it's nice to have a drink with you. It is nice. Cheers. And I deserve it, right? I do. I mean, it's not like Maya's here to nag me about it anyway. Gosh, she worries too much. I can handle myself. She cares. That's, that's what that is. That's what that is? Yeah. I mean, you guys have a good thing. You know what? I've been jealous of women like Maya. Jealous, why? I just, come on. She has everything that I've ever wanted. A good husband. This house is amazing. And your kids are so cute. They really are. I, I've always wanted to be a mom. Really? Mm-hmm. I've always wanted to be a dad. Really? Yeah. I mean, it'd be nice to have one of my own one day. You know, I mean, gosh, that's all I've ever wanted. You know, my dad used to always tell me, "A man's not a man unless he knows how to raise one." Oh, well, that's an interesting saying. He had a lot of them. All I've ever wanted to do was to make him proud. Show him that I'm my own man, right? Like, I hope I did that. Yeah, well, I can relate. I've had baby fever since I was little. Really? Yes, I remember my kindergarten teacher. She, she was pregnant and the next year she had the cutest little baby. I was so obsessed with him. I kept wanting to carry him around every time she visited. She was my favorite teacher. My kindergarten teacher was a crazy bitch. Really? Yeah, my gosh. So sorry, that's awful. Ms. Johnson. Still remember her name. I will never forget her. Hey, where, where'd you say you went to school at again? Seattle. Hooping in Seattle. Oh. Yeah, I didn't grow up here. Well, Miss Seattle, who never played ball. Come on. I think you're going to make a great mom one day. Cheers to that? Cheers to that. You didn't drink it. It's not real if you don't drink it. I'm not worried about that. I'll... I'll check on the girls when I head out. I gotta go to bed anyway, huh? Look, just maybe not say anything. Keep this between us. Of course. Good night, Elle. Good night. Be careful. Them stairs. I know, I know. You. You're unbelievable. I've done so much for you and you can't do this one thing for me. Just one. But you know what? I realize there's so many women out there that would love to gimme what I need. You know why? No? 'Cause I'm a good man. A damn good man. Life would be so much easier without you. Why? So you can use my insurance money to pay off your debts? Huh. Now why didn't I think of that? No, no, no, no. Ian, Ian, stop. Ian, stop! Ian, I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. I'm pregnant. What? Are you serious? I'm serious, I'm serious. Baby, that explains it then. That explains it. Why, why you've been so hysterical, right, baby? Because of the hormones, right? Because, because of the hormones, baby. Baby, baby, baby, we're gonna have a child. Baby. Baby, we're gonna have a child. Oh my God, oh. Baby, you need your rest. You need your rest. You need to rest, come on, right here. Lay down right here, lay down, lay, lay, lay down. Baby. You're pregnant, baby. You're pregnant. Baby, I'm gonna be a father. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Good to see you. Thank you. Hey. - Nice job. - Thank you. Hey. Thanks, man, appreciate it. Good morning, Chief. Good morning. LT. You are gonna be Lieutenant by the end of the day. The paperwork is almost done. Congratulations. So proud of you. Thank you, Chief, it's an honor. Hey, listen. Me and the guys wanna take you out at the end of the shift, right? So don't go anywhere, right? - Let's do it. - All right. You know where. Excuse me. Emily Stocklan called again, looking for a wellness check on her dad. I told you we don't have the manpower for that. Wait, wait, wait. Who? A woman wants us to check in on her father. Apparently he's not answering the phone. She's called three times this morning. What's the address? What? It's my neighbor, older guy, confused. Chief, you mind if I pop in and check in on him? I'll come with you. No, no, it's, it's fine. You should have someone with you. I said I can handle it, Liz. Hey, hey, hey. Both of you go. Make it fast. Have you seen him around lately? A couple days ago. He dropped off some mail that he grabbed by accident. Mr. Stocklan! It's Ian Flynn, your neighbor! Let's go around back. Oh, wait a minute, wait. I think I see something. Hey, Chief. Yeah, suicide from the looks of it. Yeah, coroner's taking a look right now, but it looks like it's gonna be pretty cut and dry. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Hernandez is talking to the family right now. Okay. No, no, no, it's fine, I'll, I'll wait around. You know, just in case they need anything. All right, bye-bye. Talk to the daughter? Did you know him well? Ran into him in the streets a couple times, you know? Lonely guy, but friendly. Seemed nice. It's a shame. Yeah. His daughter says it came outta nowhere. Well, I mean, some people don't talk about anything, you know? That's the way it is. Especially family. He had his keys on him. Your point? His house keys, in his pocket. Who carries their keys around on them when they're planning on killing themself? A lonely old man, Liz. Everybody's not as sharp as you, Hernandez. Yeah, but something's off. Well, we'll wait for a coroner's report, you know, get a cause of death. But, I mean, it just is what it is. I mean, we have our people looking at the scene, Liz. I mean, this guy, I mean, there was no fingerprints, right? Nobody forced themselves in the house. This guy had no enemies. Just a lonely old man who his only family lived hours away from him. You know, sometimes the answer's right in front of you. Don't think too hard. I'm gonna stick around. Why don't you head back to the station, Lieutenant? Sure there's a party brewing for you that you should get back to. Yeah, right. Are you ready for the tickle monster? Oh, bedtime already, huh? Will you tell me a bedtime story? Well, the only one I know is about a Queen Noelle. Have you ever heard of that one? - No. - No? Well, there once was a beautiful queen named Noelle. She lived in a magical castle with her sister, Grace, and their mom. And her big crown and her big sword. Of course. So when there was a dragon that came to attack the castle... She fought it. No. Queen Noelle was way smarter than that. She knew there were people inside that castle who could be hurt by that dragon. So instead of fighting, she helped them escape to another castle deep inside the woods where she knew they would be safe from that dragon. Queen Noelle wouldn't run away from a fight. Hmm. Well, sometimes running away is the smartest thing you can do. Noelle? Maya! Noelle? Grace? Maya! Oh my God. Ian, why are you yelling? Hey, baby, the, the kids are missing. What do you mean they're missing? They're not in their rooms. They're gone, I don't know where they are. - Ian! - Noelle! - Oh my God. - Grace! I didn't hear anything, I don't know. What time do you think you went to bed last night? Maybe 10. The next thing I know, Ian is yelling that they're gone. It's okay. We're gonna find them. Okay? Now, I don't know if Ian told you, but I stopped by your house the other day. Why? We got a call from one of your neighbors about a disturbance. And I saw you guys have some cameras set up. Please don't tell Ian. He has no idea that I have those. And what do you mean? He wanted me to take them down 'cause he thought they looked creepy, but I didn't. That footage gets downloaded to my computer, but I have no idea what, or if anything useful is on there. Well, why did you put them up in the first place? Because I was going back to work and I wanted to keep an eye on the nanny and the kids. I know, Chief. Right. Give me a second. We're gonna pull out every resource we have. Chief, those are my kids. I know. I think they're finished sweeping your house for prints, so you and Ian are fine to go back. But when you do, I want you to plug this into your computer. It'll give me remote access and let me look through the footage. Thank you. You're welcome. Only you would sleep through the kidnapping of your own children. I can't do this. I need some air. Flynn! There's something you need to see. Well, we're currently waiting on fingerprint analysis. Locks on the back door were broken and it looked like nothing was stolen. Elle. Ian. What the hell is happening? Maya texted me to come to the station. Kids are gone. What do you mean gone? I just saw them last night. Where's Maya? I don't know. She went to get some air or something. Let me go see if I can find her, but just call me if you need something, okay? Hey, can we chat real quick? I'd love to get a statement. Of course. Everything good over there? Yeah, yeah, I'll be back soon. Oh, it's fine, I'm using a burner. Ian. Something's wrong. What? So I dug a little deeper. There's no one named Elle Taylor that's even registered in this state. She doesn't exist. Who is she? Okay. We have facial recognition software running. We'll find her. Hernandez, we need you out here. Sorry, Chief, I gotta find my wife. Maya! Rachelle Turner. What's going on over here? Is everything all right? Everything's fine, sir. Can I help you? Ian? Mr. Stocklan. Heard a commotion coming from your house. I'm sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. Are you feeling all right? I'd like to speak with your wife. She's out back taking out the garbage. We had a little accident. But I'm sure she'll tell you that this was all just a misunderstanding. Here, let me show you. Take you out back. I guess she'll be back. Where is she? She went to the store. It's funny, she was just out here. I heard her scream. I saw you hit her! I've already called the police. They're on their way. Chief! Chief! So this whole time, you've been some sort of actress, right? It's not what you think. Well, correct me if I'm wrong. I think Rachelle went to our high school. I think you know that she never worked for a nannying company. You hired her, independently. I think you knew that she was using a fake name. Hell, I think you knew that this whole time, she was the one trying to kidnap our kids. They're not your kids. No you don't. I got you, Rachelle. What's her name? What's my girl's name right here? Hmm, oh, wow. Good job. That's nice. Okay, so now we should, we should see if the giraffe... Girls, girls, shh. Let's play quietly, okay? Stay right here and play quietly. I'll be right back. Thank God you're all right. I was so worried he'd hurt you. Thank you for everything, Rachelle. They're safe. We did it. We got away with it. We're not safe yet. He knows about you. Noelle, Grace. Babies, are you there? Oh! Oh, look at you. Oh, I'm so happy to see you. Are you guys okay? Thank you for everything, Rachelle. You girls always had my back, ever since high school. Sis, you know I got you. Sorry I've been away for so long. I still can't forgive myself for missing the funeral. No, what matters is that you're here now. If you weren't traveling and working so much, you wouldn't have this beautiful ranch. Yeah. And we should be safe here. If you would've told me what was going on, I would've left sooner, seriously. Rachelle, no one knew. And I was stupid enough to think that I could handle it by myself. He was keeping me disoriented, away from my family and friends. I was done. And trust that he would've tried to pull us apart. Never. We go too far back for that. Everything's gonna be fine now. I think me going to the police station worked, made me seem less suspicious to Ian. Yeah, well, I think it was a good idea that I brought that stupid sandwich and pretended it was his lunch! You know what? That's my girl. Sometimes you gotta laugh instead of crying. Rachelle, I'm scared of him. That man is dangerous. And it's only a matter of time before he figures everything out and finds us. That man is never gonna stop looking for me, Rachelle. And I guess his plan worked. I'm pregnant. So now what's gonna happen to me and my girls? Nothing's gonna happen. Our plan won't change. I should have left that man a long time ago, but I was afraid that he would hurt himself like his dad did. Wait, you never told me about his dad. He was a cop too. Struggled with depression and took his own life, right before I met Ian. God, I put myself, I put my girls in danger because I pitied him. I thought that I could save him and in the meantime lost myself. Girl, some things we have to turn over to God and therapy. You were never meant to save that man. Yes, but by the time I realized that, he threatened to set me up. Just stop it, okay? That's why we're here. That's why you devised a plan that's going to work. We just have to follow it. My friend will have new IDs for you by morning. I'll disappear with the girls and you go to the police and tell them everything you have. I just told you, he's the new lieutenant. Everybody over there loves him. Now, Rachelle, I'm trying to tell you that I don't know about this plan anymore. No, we're sure about the plan. Didn't you say you trust that lady cop? I don't know if I trust anyone anymore. Someone's at the gate. Here it is. Here. We have to go. My God. My God, we gotta get outta here. Okay, go grab the bags. There's only one road in and out. They're already on their way. Noelle, come on, let's go to my secret hiding place. Let's go, let me show you. Here's Mama. Hey, baby. Okay, this is yours. I wanna stay here with you. No, no, no, no, no, baby, listen, listen. We're just playing hide and seek, okay? I need you to hide for Mommy. Just promise me you'll take care of your sister, okay? Okay, I love you so much. Okay, you guys get outta here, okay? It'll be just fine, baby, I promise. Got it, baby? Come on, okay. Got it? Alright, let's go. Come on. Let's go, let's keep going, go to the right. Okay. Okay. Stay right here, okay? Until I come and get you. Okay. Sorry. Okay. Okay. Forgive me for bringing you into this. That's what sisters are for. Okay? Maya! Baby, I know you're in there. Elle! Or should I call you Rachelle? Come out, both of you, or I will come in and drag you out. We're making it outta this together, you hear me? Come on, baby, I'm giving you a choice! That's how you wanna play? You can never make things easy for me, can you, sweetheart? Come on, come on. Everything's gonna be okay. I'll protect you. I'll shoot if either one of you move. Do it, coward. Where are the girls? You will never see my babies again. Don't you dare. If you shoot her, I will kill myself and your baby. Baby, you ain't got it in you. I don't believe you. Try me. No one's here. The place is torn up. What could he have done with her? If you just let Elle go, I will go with you. I won't hurt myself or our baby if you just let her go. No, no. She'll tell everybody. Oh, no, no, no, baby, we're in the middle of nowhere. She won't have time. Honey, we will be long gone. All right? You, me, and our family. 'Cause we're family, right? Yes, baby. That's right. Better than my old man, right? And I never abandoned you. I never abandoned you. No, no, no, no, no. You tried to leave me. Because pregnancy makes you confused. Okay? It's okay. I promise you, we can just leave. We can get out of town, and I promise you, promise you that I will obey this time. Okay? All you have to do is let Rachelle go. Ian, come on. You know how to make us disappear. Yeah? Yeah. Listen, Ian, she'll just slow us down. Just let her go. She serves no purpose, honey, come on, it's just us and the family. Elle, get outta here before I change my mind. Go! It's okay, it's okay, go, go! Hello? Can somebody hear me? Hello, hello? Can somebody hear me? We need help, hello. How do I know you won't shoot me? Baby, I have my priorities straight, all right? Okay. Okay. Just put the gun down so I know you won't hurt me. All right. All right, it's going away, okay? It's gone, okay? Baby, put the knife down. Come on, put it down. Okay. Okay, come here. Come here, baby. Okay, now where did you stash the girls over here, right? Tell 'em that daddy's home to come save the day, all right? Okay? Okay. You can just stay right here and I'll go get them. How should I explain all this to the girls? Just, just tell 'em the truth, baby, okay? Tell 'em that Elle made Mommy and Daddy fight, all right, and now she's gone and she'll never come back, okay? Okay, okay. Would you mind getting my car? Because yours is gonna be too easy to track. What are you talking about? I'm not stupid. No, no, no, Ian, I know that you're not- Oh, babies, babies. - Mommy! - I love you so much. Come on. What's going on? It's okay, baby, everything's gonna be just fine. Come on now, hurry. We're fine, baby, we're fine! Okay, Noelle, don't hurt yourself! Okay, Noelle, go in the other side. Go in the other side. Okay, Grace, let's get in here. Okay. Come on, Elle, come on! It's okay, baby. It's okay. You guys okay? Yeah, we need to go, we need to go! Ian, no! Ian, the girls are in the car! Stop it! Oh my God, what do I do? Elle, what do I do? I don't know, drive the car! Maya, Rachelle, are you all right? Yeah. Ian, he... Where is he? Right there.
