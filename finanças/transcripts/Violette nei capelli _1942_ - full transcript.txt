Violets in her Hair How good he was I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me; Lend me thy handkerchief. - Here, my lord. - No, that which I gave you. I have it not about me. - Not? - Is it lost? - Heaven bless us Fetch it, let me see it. - Alas - I want the handkerchief - The handkerchief Where to find it? - I want the handkerchief The handkerchief - Which handkerchief> - I've... I've lost a handkerchief... And what a way to burst in. You frightened me You're the one who frightened me. Never mind about a hanky. It's brains you've lost. I welcomed you and taught you a trade and here's the reward. What am I doing wrong? I'm slaving all day for you. And in the evening you go and have fun. Where, I'd like to know? - That doesn't concern you. - What? Doesn't concern me? But what would you be without me? To bed, immediately! No. Don't touch them. What harm have they done you? Me, none. The harm's to you. They've addled your brains. Tomorrow we'll settle matters. Now I'm tired. Because all day, I work... I do! Get up early. You have to go fix a dress from Miss Mattei. And turn off the light. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. - May I? - One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four. Come in, our castle is open. Or would you rather wait for the butler? I advise against it. You'd have a very long wait. Will you tell the chatelaines what you want? - I... - I understand, you first want to know who you have the honour to talk to. I am the nymph. This is a wood. And the violin player isn't our father, but Orpheus. Orpheus was a well-known and distinguished professional. Don't listen to my sister. Once she starts she never stops. What is it? I'm the first floor seamstress. The mistress sent me up... Did you hear? Come on, go get the dress to fix. Sit down. No, not there. It's broken. Here. - One, two, three, four... - Here's the dress. We must shorten it and give grace to life. That's the fashion now, isn't it? Well done, you've brought everything. Great idea. You'll never find a needle and thread in our house. - Let her work in peace, Oliva. - Oliva? My name has nothing to do with anchovies and other appetizers. It was a tribute from my father to the protagonist of "Twelfth Night". - It's a Shakespeare comedy. - Ah, I know him. I went to see Othello last night. He wrote it, didn't he? Bravo! Do you like Shakespeare too? With us he is like one of the family. Do you know him? He's so fine. He must be really nice to talk to us. - Very nice. - Yes, why don't you tell her we've invited him to lunch? - Do you like music? - I love it. It's something that does so much good here in the heart and also so much evil. Right? - Then you also like the theatre. - It's my only passion. - Do you like reading? - Always, especially poems. Maybe I don't really understand them, but I repeat them over to myself. It's just like music. Come, let's go, time is to bloom again. You are too pale. Your face is almost a lily. Fantastic! You'll love my sister. The meeting of two loonies. Music, dream, poetry... We're already in the stratosphere. Don't listen to her. She only thinks about sports. I know real poetry when I fly down the slopes. Not like you twirling between a cardboard tree and a painted bush. Shut up, theatre isn't painted cardboard. It is life, dream, fantasy. Even when you twirl between two drivers in shirt sleeves? - What's going on? - Sorry, dad. We've discovered Eleonora Duse, seamstress. In fact, I still don't know if it's Eleonora Duse or Adelina Patti. - Come on, tell daddy who you are, he always wants to know everything. - Carina. It's a name that I invented. The others call me Carlottina. - Pretty And you act? - Who would dare? I'm a poor seamstress. But she's so good, you know. She recited some verses to us really well. Well, if she has talent, we can try her out. At Tronchetti's. - Great! - An excellent idea. - She was a great actress who now teaches. - Come, it's late, off to the theatre. - To the theatre? - Yes, why? - In the morning? - They're going for rehearsals. - What is it, an earthquake? - No, dad, it's Giorgio. Finally. Here, I got them fixed. Be careful, next time. I can't waste time because of you. - Thanks, you're a treasure - I should think so, I spent 15 lire. - Wait till I get it. - No, it doesn't matter. I'm in a hurry. - See you tomorrow at the stadium. Bye, Mirella. - Giorgio! Alright! - What did that wild boy want? - He brought my ski poles. Soon I'll begin training for the 100 meters. - Yes, but leave me my jacket. Come on, Oliva. - Bye, Carina. - What about me? - Want to come to the rehearsal? - No, the dress fitting. No, I must dash. I thought you wanted to come to the rehearsal. If only I could. I'd love to go there. - Would you like to? - You bet. - Then let's go. Dad, I'm bringing a spectator. Do you mind? - As you wish, but hurry up. - Let's go. - Is it the nymph's dress? - Yes, we're all nymphs. - Can you help me? - Right. - Are you a colleague? - I am... - She's a friend. She came to see the rehearsal. - Delighted. Girls, the maestro has arrived. Come see the maestro. He is the sweetest man in the world. - He's come for the rehearsal. - One moment. - There he is, look. - Where? I can't see him. - There. - Is the orchestra ready? - Yes, sir. - We need to try the ballet again. - Alright. - He's in grey. - He seems in a good mood. - Whilst he's a bachelor, there's hope. - Knowing you, he'll be so for life. He is an extraordinary man and a great artist known all over the world. - Lucky him. What does he do? - Conducts the orchestra. When I dance I feel tied like a thread to his baton. And I see nothing around me anymore, only him. - And does he know? - Fat chance. He doesn't even know I exist. He doesn't know enough? If I were you, I'd tell him... - Dancers on stage. - We have to go. - No, don't come with us. Go to the auditorium. - Oh thanks. - I always went in the gallery. - The gallery is closed now. Take this door on the left, but don't get caught or else. - Will they make me pay for the ticket? - No, they'll just throw you out. Oh, if that's all. Did you put that guy in his place? Be careful, I'm warning you. Who is that? How many times must I repeat I don't want anyone in rehearsals? Hey, you, come here, stop. Who are you? - I'm the nymph's friend. - What did you say? I am the friend of the nymph. - Ssh... And who would this nymph be? - She's one of the dancers. - When she's not dancing, her name's Oliva. She's the best of all. And didn't she tell you that you can't stay here? Now go and wait for your nymph at the theatre exit. Go... go! Silence. Ten minutes break. - Oliva, I spoke to him. - To whom? - Your maestro. You did? What did he tell you? First he wanted to send me away believing I was a nuisance. As soon as I said the name of Oliva, "Ah, the beautiful Oliva" he said. - And I: "Yes, Oliva of 'Thirteenth Night'". - Twelfth... 13th is better: Brings luck. And he said, "That girl will make a fine career." Would this be Oliva, the famous nymph? - What course are you doing? - The penultimate, master. Ah, good. So, next year, the farewell show. And then, hopefully, prima ballerina. Master... I love you so much, master. Fine! Now we go out during the day too? The night is no longer enough! - Where have you been? - At Miss Mattei's, where you told me. At Miss Mattei's? Liar! I went upstairs to see and no one was there. Where have you been? Speak up! - At the theatre, with them. - The theatre? - They invited me... like a friend. Ah! But why don't they also invite you to lunch and even to sleep? - If I asked them, they wouldn't say no, I'm sure. - Are you sure? - They also told me, but I didn't want to. - Then why don't you go there? You will see what a nice welcome your friends will give you! But remember one thing... If you leave here, there's no coming back. - Go, go, why wait? - Sure. Sure I'll go. Carina! Now go to bed and don't worry about a thing. - Yes, it's okay for tonight, but after? - We'll see. Now think about sleeping. So are you really going to take me to that acting teacher? Oh, of course. Didn't you hear what dad said? Anyway, I wanted to take you. Get ready to meet the greatest artist of the century. Good night. - And what about you? Not sleepy? - I'm so happy here. Today is the best day of my life and I owe it to you. I could die right now, I'm so happy. I am happy too and that's why I'd hate to die. - All winter I've waited for him to notice me and talk to me. - Who? To you it seems an ordinary man, but, no: He's a genius. The whole world knows his name. His hands are magical. When he brushed against me today... what a thrill. I'm surprised I didn't faint. On the stairs? Faint on the stairs? But it's dangerous. His eyes, aren't they wonderful? - His smile, his voice... - I thought he talked through his nose. That voice said my name. My name... on his lips... - Have you never been in love? - Been in love? - Yes, in love. Really, me... Yes, I too have been in love. Tell me, who were you in love with? I saw him pass every morning, at the same time, with his milk bottles. He was a milkman. I really like milk, so I immediately became fond of him. - That's not love. - Pack it in? What have you got to say at this hour? Aren't you sleepy? And in the morning you stay in bed. Lazybones! It's useless: some things you'll never understand. I'd spend all night watching the stars. Instead of looking at stars, let the sleepy one sleep. - Good night. - Good night. Ah, now I understand why the Mattei's keep you with them. - What do you mean? - You know I saw. Show what you're hiding. One of the models of your great tailoring. - Who do you think you are? You're nothing but a poor servant. - Servant? I'm the mistress, indeed, more than the mistress. I'm the only one in charge. Carina! Do you know where you put my tie? I can't find it anymore. I put it in the tie drawer. I'll go get it. That's why I couldn't find it. I looked everywhere but there. - With all this order, I can't make head nor tail of it. - Here. Bravo, dear. Since you've been here, this house doesn't know itself. - I appreciate it. - What are you saying? You don't know what you've done for me. I felt like I was suffocating in that closet where I lived before. I felt there was something beautiful in life, but it all seemed a forbidden world for me. You've put hope in my heart that I'll succeed and that I'm not alone. - Now you also have two little sisters who love you. - Two little sisters? - Carina. - Mirella. - Mirella, what's up? - There's a surprise for you. Can't you guess? A great actress sends it for you. - Bye, Mirella - Bye Giorgio. It's the script. Oh, let's go! The script. - Open it up, let's see your part. - I don't dare, you open it. - What would you like to do? - A tragic part. To cry, to make you cry. - Here it is... - My part. Here it is. Act II, scene VIII. Giustina, the maid, opening the window wide: "Oh, ma'am, there's a moon tonight." Well, my part isn't too big. We hope you can keep it all in mind. For a debut you can't expect anything more. The important thing is to cross the sacred threshold of the stage. After all, many things can be expressed in one sentence. Especially inspired by a beautiful cardboard moon hanging by a thread. "Oh, ma'am, there's a moon tonight." "Oh, ma'am, there's a moon tonight." "Oh, ma'am There's a moon tonight." Leave that moon alone and think of hungry me. You're lucky: There's tons of stuff. Oliva left without wanting to eat. - Why didn't Oliva eat? - I think it's because... er... Mirella, do you know something? Why has Oliva changed lately? She's sad, melancholy, she no longer eats. Is she feeling unwell? - Ask Carina. She knows everything. - What do you know? - I don't know anything. Perhaps some small displeasure. - Displeasure? Displeasure at leaving her companions. The season is over. - The orchestra breaking up. - Orchestra? I was talking about friends. - But aren't you going? It's late. - Yes, but... - Well, alright... I'm going. Goodbye. - Good evening. - Bye, Dad. Let's hope Oliva comes back soon, or we'll have to wait for her. - Not me. I'm eating and off to bed. - I'll wait for her... studying the part. Quiet, girls Let's not make a mountain out of a molehill. It's quite simple. One of us says: "We wanted to say goodbye" and gives him the flowers. Girls, we don't have anymore time. He's greeted the orchestra. Any more arguing and he'll be gone. - But who gives him flowers? - The flowers - Oliva Mattei. - Oliva, give it to the master for us. - Yes, come on. - No I can't. - On behalf of us all. - No... - Tell him we love him. - No I can't. - Why not? May I? I've said goodbye to everyone. I'd have been sorry to leave without saying goodbye... that is, see you soon to all my charming collaborators. - The flowers, Oliva, the flowers. - For me? Thank you, dear. Thank you so much. That kiss is meant for you all. And thank you. Farewell. Then Giorgio said, "You're an exceptional girl." "You're not the kind one meets every day." It's nice to hear it from such a nice person, isn't it? - Hey, what's wrong? - Oh, sorry, I was thinking. - You're also thinking of someone? - Yes, Oliva, she's not back yet. - It's late. - She must have been delayed at the theatre. - I'm dead tired. I'm going to bed. Are you waiting for Oliva? - Sure. I'm waiting for her too, but sleeping. Good night. Hey, I said goodnight. It's her, I heard the door close. I'll go and meet her. I had to witness it. Oh, poor thing. She's quite possessed. - Carina, where are you going? - To meet you. Where have you been? - Oliva - It's over. I'll never see him again. - The conductor. - I'll never hear his voice again, never see him again. - He's dead? - Worse. He left. - Don't be silly If he left, he'll return. - When? - It's not difficult to know. I'll take care of it. And when he does, he won't remember me. We'll refresh his memory. I'll take care of that too. Now let's go. Upstairs. What's this funeral air? Let some light in. Leave me alone. This music's good for me. You must go for a walk, get out. Don't stay cooped up listening to the same record all day. I don't want to move. I'm tired. Ah, here's your illness. Now I've discovered it. And to think that your father wanted to call the doctor. Don't worry. You'll see that he'll return. You will see his magical hands and his heavenly eyes. You will hear his sweet voice again. "I don't want anyone anymore" What is it, are you studying a new part? I am studying a very difficult part, that of the "martinet". You tell her now, dad? Yes, but leave it to me. My authority is needed with her. Dear romantic lady, your ills will pass in the open air. - So get your suitcase, ready to go. - I won't move from here. I'm fine. It's nothing. Stop pestering me. I can't stand it anymore. Oliva, stop it. Listen to what Dad says. Not only must she listen, she must also obey. It's about your health. You need a little countryside. I've rented a small house. You'll leave immediately. I'll join you when I've finished my tour of the provinces. Listen to dad. I too am sorry to be separated from you, but you need it. - Think I'd let them leave without you? - I'm coming too? - Of course. I've always dreamed of seeing a meadow, a cow, a sheep close up. - Will I see some sheep? - You'll have a flock all to yourself. - I can't go. - Why not? - My part, Sunday's performance. Oh, if it's for that part... I understand, dear, but Oliva would lose a precious week. - I don't care. - I've dreamed so much about this play. I've more than five minutes on stage to put the room in order. - It's not to be sneezed at. - You've decided to ruin my vacation. No, Mirella, listen. I've changed my mind. I'll sneeze at it. And then, an actress like me gets the lead role or nothing. So, when do we leave? Quick, we have to get to the forest before the sun is too high. - The nymphs are waiting. - First we must prepare for the sacred rite of fire. Hey, wait a minute, what about tidying up? As usual, I'll have to take care of our jade and porphyry dishes. A cow. I'm sorry, dear, not to invite you to lunch, but we've only enough for us. You'll always find the table set. Look over there. - Hey, Carina Who are you talking to? - To our neighbour. - Don't make too many friends, or goodbye peace. - Don't worry. - Come on, girls, are you ready? - What are you wearing? The dress of the sacred rite. It's the new moon. We don't keep the nymphs waiting. - Come on, let's go - Come on, girls - Let's run An oak. - Carina! - I'm here. Here, you are the fairy Titania. And you will be Rosalinda. And I... - You are Terpsichore, the muse of dance. - It's "Terpsichore". - Doesn't matter. - And now let's go perform the sacred rite. - Let's go. Here, it's lit. No, no, that's enough. All three of us must gather by the fire. - I'll start. - No, I'll start. I want to live in a house in the mountains with my life partner. I desire the love of the man I love. - I want to become a great actress. - Jump! - Come on, jump. - One moment. Damn it! You're the ones who let all my partridges escape? I'll sort you out! What are you doing? Scaring all the partridges! - Have you no where else to light a fire? - No sir. It's you who frightened us. Got up just like a scarecrow. Wicked girl. I'll give you "scarecrow". - Here we are, girls. - How beautiful. There's even an oak. - But it's not an oak - And where's the fantasy? It's a beech tree that we, with our magical power, will transform into an oak. So, here we drip three drops of our blood into a cup. And now we drink, swearing never to break our friendship. I swear to consider our friendship as the most beautiful thing in my life... and to be ready to make any sacrifice for... - What's wrong? - Nothing, I'm so happy. It's nice to be so united and to love each other so much. Come on, no tears. Fairies never cry. To me, Rosalinda, Titania! Play and sing! Terpsichore invites you to dance! Violets in your hair, hedge flowers, dreams of love Fragments of glimmering stars descended from the sky over my heart. Alone, with the thrill in my heart, I still want your perfume I would like to undress you, I would like to kiss you... my sweet little flower Violets in your hair, gentle nymph, sunbeam. I want to dance, always to dream... violets in my heart... I want to dance, always to dream... violets in my heart... A really nice show Bravo, congratulations We're sorry to have interrupted you. May I ask who you are? - Three fairies. - Oh, look. Three authentic fairies? We came down from the sky last night, sliding on a moon beam. And are you going to stop long among us poor mortals? Now that you've disturbed us, we'll be forced to stay at least a fortnight. We've caused a lot of trouble. How can we atone? Poor fairies. Forced to live two weeks among us. - And will we be allowed to see you sometime? - Oh, it's very difficult. Now we are girls, now butterflies, now bushes and now... trout. So you were the cloud that peeked into my room this morning. I don't peek into boys' rooms - Come on, Giuliano, it's getting late. - Let's go. If you're going to turn into a lizard or a stone, make me a sign. - I wouldn't want to hurt you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, lady fairies. - Goodbye. - What have you broken? - What a question. Don't you recognize the noise? It seems that's a noise that makes itself heard a little too often. When Giorgio arrives, he'll have to drink his soup from the palm of his hand. - By the way, when is he arriving? - I don't know. He promised to come and then he didn't show up anymore. He's probably busy. But you'll see, we see him up here someday. - May I come in? - Come on. There's always room for everyone. - Did you happen to see the engineer? - The one who built this villa? - We're looking for him too. - No, Giuliano, the man who was with me yesterday. We were supposed to met here, but I've not seen him since. - I really thought he'd come here. - Do you want to search the drawers? No, thanks. But if you don't mind, I'd like to wait for him. I've an idea he'll be around. Please, make yourself at home. Take a seat. Oliva, see if there's something to offer the young lady in the pantry. Usually we feed on rose petals, but a sandwich for a guest can be found. - Very kind of you. - You're welcome. Have I by chance interrupted some other dance, some other show? - No, they weren't worthy of you anyway. - Miss dances very well. - I also danced at a few charity nights. - Really? I was so successful, marriage proposals rained on me every evening. - Did you accept them all? - I'll only marry a man who offers me a position. At long last! I thought it was the gnomes washing the laundry. - No, gnomes are partying today. - Or who knows when I'd see you again. - But what need was there to meet again? - None, you're right. - Yet you knew how pleased I'd be. - Thank you. A self-respecting fairy mustn't thank. The tributes are due to her. Then help me carry the basket. You can see that Giuliano got lost in the woods. - Thank you for your hospitality. - Don't mention it. - Tomorrow I'm having a party. If you'd like to come... - Us? My villa is the one in the Novecento style, the most beautiful in the country. I'd send the car to pick you up, but I don't think it can get this far. - Don't bother. With our wings we'll fly down to you. - Very kind. There'll be some music and a nice dinner if you're interested. - Thanks for everything and goodbye. - Goodbye. Myrrh, frankincense! Burn the perfumes. We must purify the air. Did you smell that bourgeois odour? Ah, here you are. Is this a new sport? Sorry, Alda. I met miss and so... We must get back. Or did you promise the young lady to wash the floors too? - Good morning. - Don't mind, it's just her character. It's gone to the bad, acidic. Goodbye. - Air, air - You can't breathe in here. It's suffocating. - What are you doing? Silence, hold your breath. There's impure air. Wait. At last it's breathable. Now we can talk. - We had the honour... - The great honour... We had the excellent privilege of being invited to a ball. - Yes, from the "Queen of millions". - A dance? - Not a dance. A huge ball. - Full of snooty types like her. - And was I invited too? - Naturally. - Great! - What will we wear? - But... we can go dressed like this. No, I'll wear my beautiful fairy dress. No. We'll have to go all three dressed alike. And I, with four pennies, will make you a dress you've never dreamed of! Hurry, the music we've chosen for their arrival. Stop! The fairies are coming. Here are supernatural beings who feed on rose petals. - Watch out, they've got some nerve. - Oh, good, you came. Here are my friends. If you want to perform miracles, we are at your disposal. Real fairies! But here we have heaps of fun. - Is it true that fairies marry pixies? - What? Fauns, you mean? - Do fauns have goat's feet? - Fauns are centaurs - What a horror. Do you want to see a faun? - Want to dance with a faun of honest intentions? - Thanks, I can't dance. Liar! Fairies mustn't tell lies. But if you don't want to dance, I don't mind a "zic". - I thought they were serious people. - That's exactly why they talk like that. - Let's do the apple dance? - Apple? Yes, the "Big Apple". Translation: the apple. I'm an ace, look. Dad wanted me to graduate in agriculture, instead I graduated in the apple. Have you devoured chicory? Have you eaten the leaf? Come on, dance. Who have we here? But how come? Are you friends with my daughter? - The mistress invited me. - I'm the master of the house. - Well, how are the partridges? - Great, but I can't catch one. But now I got you. Shall we do a little dance together? Listen, babe, you're really hot. You're dynamic, I'd say almost dynamite. - Do you like apple dancing? - Yeah, but I know an even more beautiful one. - Oh yes? Which? - The melon. - Great. How do you do it? A little further apart, eyes closed, right arm raised and turn. Rhythm! - You - Me. - What are you doing here? - I'm joining in the party. - Miss Alda invited me. - Ah, and you're in the anteroom? - It's a lot more fun. - Let's go to the salon. No, the salon, no, really no. Between the apple, melon and faun dance, I prefer a walk. Maybe you're right. Let's go. All alone, the nymph of the woods, absorbed in romantic dreams? - Know what I'd give to be a tree? - I don't understand. There'd be the hope you'd dance around me. Then at least you'd be useful as firewood... no regrets. But how? Would you have the courage to chop up a good tree like me? A heart lurks 'neath this young bark. My branches stretch out strangely. No leaf falls, without God's will. - Hopefully this song will last forever. - Why, do you like it so much? No, but so I can stay a little closer to you. - Miss Alda is your fianc?e, isn't she? - So she says. If she says so, it means there's an element of truth. Stop. Stay like that for a moment Look at me like a little while ago. - A little more than three quarters. Now I remember. - What? Where I saw you. One evening at the theatre. - In the stalls and you were near me. - Never in my entire life. - Yes. Indeed, at the exit I tried to find you. Nothing. You'd disappeared, Vanished. Now I understand why. You're an almost supernatural being. Oh, please Don't fantasize too much about me. - What are you? Lawyer? Doctor? - What a violent interrogation. - Graduating in Engineering. - Then you shouldn't bother with me. I'm not one of those girls that you know. Until recently I was a seamstress' helper. I tell you in case you mistake me for a duchess or a princess. Then a needle and thread are your greatest ambitions. Oh, you're very wrong there. Now I understand that your greatest ambition is candy. That's nothing to laugh about. It has been for years. I suffered a lot from the "drops". Do you know what candy they are? Those without wrappers, with flowers painted on them, so big. I spent months in front of the grocer's where they were in the window. Suffering from not being able to buy them. And then, finally, when I had the money, they didn't sell them anymore. The candies have gone out of style and I haven't seen them anymore. Please, don't cry. I've a friend who has a candy shop and... - If you laugh then you didn't understand. - I understand many things instead. Now I've told you the "drops" story, I don't know what to tell you anymore. It doesn't matter. It's enough for me that you're silent here, near me. - Why do you look at me like that? - Can I see you again? - I go to the trout stream every morning. - Where is it? - Find it. Sorry. Ah, welcome. And I've looked for you everywhere. - Are you spending the party on the balcony? - I was listening to you. You've no idea how sweet your trilling is heard from afar. Continue this isolation cure and you'll lose the dances I've reserved for you. A fine pickle. He'd never console himself. Come on, this dance is rightfully yours. Goodbye. See you later. - You had fun behind her back? - She was the one having fun. - She's a girl full of spirit. - I find all three stupid. They don't know how one behaves in society. Look at your fairies over there. They appear to be tired of rose petals. Let's hope they left something for us too. It's easy to be charitable with other people's stuff. Ah, yes, it's true. You owe everything to her. Come on, good children, say thank you to the young lady. - Thank you - You want miracles? The first one is done. And now that you've fed the chicks, will you return to the dance? - We really meant to leave. - Yes, we're so tired. Yes, we would like to leave, but... Thank you awfully for coming. We had so much fun. For us too. We've never attended such a party. And we have never had the honour of having such accomplished guests. - Well, come on. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Have you got a stiff neck? I can't wait to be in bed. I wanted to suggest going to the stream. It must be delightful tonight. - Dreamer, there is nothing more to do. - What's this? - A telegram. Dad taken by sudden illness. Come now. Come on, girls, it's late. It's seven o'clock, get up. Good morning, Mirella! Good morning, Oliva! Oliva, what are you doing? Not getting up? Oliva, what is it? Listen, Carina, will you promise you'll never leave us? What are you saying? Have I left you through all these months? Since dad died, I feel so alone and lost without him. What are you saying? Dad is always here with us. - Don't get yourself down like this. Come on, smile. - You really are a dear. - Without you I don't know what we'd have done. - Nonsense! And now get up. It's late. Mirella, hurry! Look what Carina did. She must have worked all night. - They weren't there last night. Carina! - What is it? I'm busy. Don't tell me again. they brought them while we slept. You worked all night. Look, Carina, it's time to put a stop to it. Put that stuff right away and mind your own business. Get the cups. Breakfast is almost ready. OK, but we'll talk about it later. It can't continue. It's so unfair her sacrificing herself so much for us. You're right. Today I'll change track. If I could get some good news... Think I'll get the job? It's essential, Mirella. You must succeed at all cost. Giorgio has encouraged me. And you, when's your farewell show? A few days, I think. I'm so scared. Don't mention it. But why? You'll see what will happen. It'll be a real triumph. - I don't care about anything anymore. - What's that? - It's ready! Come on, ladies, breakfast is ready. The milk is delicious. Just like butter. I have to go to the lab. And if all goes well, I'll have good news. - Will they pay you today? - No, no. - Then what? Mystery, secret, Carina won't even say one syllable. Mum's the word. Only one day, when everyone applauds... - The theatre - You've got a part. - Damn! Goodbye secret. I should keep my mouth zipped. You've sacrificed your daughter's property. Don't dispose of her heart. Oh, my God, how you suffer! Ah. you cry! What then happened? And why look at me like that? I search in your eyes for the courage I lack. - Hortensia, daughter, forgive me. - Forgive you, me? My luck, that of your mother, the present... all is lost. One moment, let me talk. My birth is ignoble, low is my condition. Rejected by the fortunes offered by caree... Rejected by the careers that offer fortunes and honours... I asked the ocean that which the earth has renounced me. - It refused. - Renounced. - Refused. - Re.... - Refused - It's refused. - Oh, good, you came, huh? You know we were going over the part a bit. Well done, accountant. Well done, everyone. - Did you bring the shorts? - Will you find a part for me? Yes, darling, there's a part, but it's a bit difficult. Will you get by? Our audience certainly knows its stuff. - Not to say, but we've spoiled them. - Oh, but I feel absolutely certain. I can play any part. Young, old... - Oh, but how pale you are tonight. - Really? I work too hard. Did you see how well I gave the line? - Of course, it takes confidence. - The boss... - One, two, three... - Ten. Ten pairs of shorts. Alright, put them away. - I'll wait for you tonight. - Don't worry, I'll be on time. - Don't present yourself without knowing the part by heart. - No, no... One moment. The money. Art is a beautiful thing, but... Hey, careful. Is that the way to cross? And you look where you're going! - Oh, the fairy - You. - I've been looking for you everywhere. I've been several times where you lived, but I haven't found you. I thought you'd turned into a flower, a tree... I interrogated all the plants. And now what have you transformed yourself into? Into a person in a hurry, with an appointment and doesn't want to delay. In that case, my car and I put ourselves at your disposal. - No thanks, I can't. I don't want to. - Why not? There'll be someone waiting for you... Miss Alda, for example. No, don't say that name. She might appear at any moment. - Where do I accompany you to? - The opera house. A friend is waiting. - Ah, one of your famous friends. Do you still live with them? - Sure. We swore it in the mountains. They were left alone. I couldn't leave them. It was tough to start with, but now we make ends meet. - And you sacrifice your life for others? - Who mentioned sacrifice? - We're like sisters. We help each other. - You're extraordinary. - Think so? Once I knew a fairy and now you're a little woman full of common sense. - Who knows what you'll be next time. - A witch who'll scare you. And you will have to run to your Alda for help and protection. Let's not talk of Alda. Let's talk about us. Do you know it's been ages since we met? All your fault, though. - But from now on it won't happen again. What's that? - The script. - What script? For the play I start rehearsing tonight. - Are you also an actress? - Naturally. - Extraordinary - You've said that. - Magnificent, then. Alright? A little too much. At least, now, before my debut. - Come on, let's leave together. - I'll change and then come. - Hurry. - What's the rush Where do you have to go? - It's almost noon. - What are you doing, come on? - I'm waiting for Carina. - Always excuses. Leave her be. She's getting above herself. Now I've said what I do. Look me up. You'll find me. Goodbye and thanks. I believe we'll see each other soon. - At last I thought you'd never come. - Oliva, if you only knew what happened. A wonderful thing. Guess who I met. - Tell me later. Let's go. - Wait! He might still be outside. - Who? - Him, the engineer, Giuliano! - He remembered you. - Remembered? He was six months on the banks of a stream waiting for me. - Poor guy. He'll have turned into a mushroom. - Aren't you happy? Feel how my heart beats. Oh, I'm so happy. - Happy you who still believe in this nonsense. - Oliva, what is it? Nothing, what should it be? - So, Oliva, are you coming or not? - Thanks, I can't. I told you that Oliva was becoming mysterious. - Not at all mysterious She'll be in love. - Come on, girls, don't torment her. It must be serious not to have accompanied the maestro to the station. Won't you ever stop it? Well, shall we go? - Do you think it's good what you've done? - What did I do? Nothing. Why didn't you tell me the maestro was back? - Did you see him again? - Yes. He was here. He directed Aida. Is that all there is? I always tell you everything. I thought you knew. And then why should I tell you? There may also be something I can keep to myself, for me alone. - Oliva! - Sorry, Carina. Let's go. - Not changing? Aren't you playing? - Thanks, I can't. I'm waiting for Giorgio. - Know anything about the contest? - Not yet. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Giorgio! - Mirella, good news. - Well, what did you find out? Nothing official, but they assured me you were chosen. - Fantastic! Who did you hear it from? - From Miss Branchia. I'm so happy. Not so much for me, but for the girls. Carina can't continue slaving. Oliva will soon be independent too. - I can't spend my life doing ski races. - Your head's screwed on pretty good. I'll miss you so much. It's difficult finding a good friend like you. I'm not running away. You always know where to find me. - All men say the same, then forget. - What are you talking about. Let's go to the bar for an orangeade. You've deserved it, teacher. On stage guys, are we slacking? Oh, Pellizzoni You're there too. Who sent me this scoundrel? So here's the town, here the sofa, here the armchair. - You lie down and sob. - Where, on the ground? - No, in the armchair when it's there. - Here we go again. When I was in lacchi and Cotognola's company there were armchairs. - Can I cry and sob without lying down? - A true artist also cries on their feet. You go ahead and say... What are you doing with that beard? - What are you doing with that beard? - No! What's with a beard at rehearsals? I want to get used to it, it goes in my mouth. - Keep it there and spit it out after the show. - And my hands? I don't know where to put them. I didn't think I had so many. Put them in your pocket, behind your back, wherever. - Behind. Thank you, maestro. - Sorry, where do I put my feet? - In your pocket. Er, no. - They annoy me. - And your head doesn't? - No, that no. - What made you think of acting? - I've the sacred fire of art. As a child, to be among artists, I'd sell magazines in the theatre. It's true. Do you want to rehearse or are you tired? I'm never tired I know everyone's parts. Do you want me to try them all? No, this one must learn his lines. Come on, courage. You must tell me the lines in a lively tone. - So I can attack with mine. - Here and you, meanwhile, sob. I always believed... - But I can't understand anything. - They won't hear you in the front row. - But if there is no one in the front row - Yeah, but I have to understand you. Come on. Liven up, huh? I was always led to understood that you left hope, that... that you let it run, that you ran hoping, that you hoped running... - What a disaster - Don't worry, I'll attack immediately. - It's badly written... You knew that anxious life has been mine these months. I pressed my heart so that no one would feel it beat. But who could, in this alternative of mistrust and despair... who could tell me if my work had value or had none. - And tomorrow... - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow. No, tomorrow I can't, I'm busy. I understand, you want to know tomorrow what I will do. It doesn't matter. The important thing is that someone understands me. Let anyone come now. I will suffer again, but I will know how to wait. No one can take from me what I have conquered. - Sorry, sir, what do you want? - I just... - Giuliano! Ah, I understand. Rehearsal's over. See you tomorrow. Thank God! And if there are no armchairs tomorrow, you'll be the one sobbing. Well... OK, but... - How did you find me? - I read 12 mystery books. I followed your tracks, put my ear to the ground to hear your footsteps. No woman has ever made me cover as much ground you do. - And why do it? - It's not so difficult to guess. Oh, I've understood for ages, but I put everything in a bottle. - What's that? What bottle? - You don't know? I have a magic bottle. I take sorrows and dreams, put them in and leave them as long as possible. - You too have been months in that bottle. - No wonder I ache all over. Instead, I let you wander in the world of my dreams. - Do you dream a lot? - Even daydreams. And how did you see me? Elegant? Do I change clothes often? - Did you remember I liked candy? - You're always joking. - I believe you want to escape me. - But I'm here with you. Answer frankly: Do you want to see me? - Answer sincerely: Why do you want to see me? - Why... Hush... you better not say. Presumptuous young miss, what do you hope to hear? I want to see you again because you're different from the girls I've known. - For better or worse I don't know yet... - And will it take you ages to decide? - That depends on you. - I can't stay, I must go home. I mustn't leave Oliva alone. Her farewell show is tomorrow. - It'll be a wonderful sight - "Farewell show"? Farewell to whom? - Farewell to school, to the show. Will you come? - I'll be there. But, for me, the best show will be that of your enthusiasm. Hey, have you finished these blessed rehearsals? Not yet. We're rehearsing the ending. We don't know how it'll go. We hope well. Let's hope so. But with these romantic comedies you never can tell. Oliva! Oliva, what's happened to you? Speak. What is it? - It's nothing. I'm better, leave me. - Yes, lie down here. What is it? Everything was spinning round and then nothing. Then you came... Carina! But what else is there? Do you want to put the fear of God into me? Come on, tell me. No, Carina, I can't. I don't want to. Leave me here alone. Don't worry about me, it's not worth it. It's no longer worth it. Why not? Come on. What have you done? I can't tell you. - Alright, as you wish. - No, Carina Don't leave me. Don't go away. I only have you. Stay with me. I've such a fear of being alone... If you want me to stay, you must tell me everything that's happened to you. Well? You know, it's true... I saw the maestro again. - I swore not to say anything to anyone, but now... - Why? No You mustn't know. Or you won't love me anymore. Stop talking nonsense and tell me what happened. When I heard he was back, I went to him... at his house. Don't look at me like that, please. You... - You did? - Yes, Carina. I wanted to die... A fine thing to do! Don't let it get you down. Go to him and tell him... No! I don't want to see him anymore. I don't want to hear about him. I hate him! I hate him! I want to go away forever. Open up! Open the door! - Please, she mustn't know anything. - No, dear, don't worry. What's the hurry! What's wrong with you today? - Haven't you heard? Victory! - You got the job? - Yes! - Oliva! - I won! Why the face? - It's nothing. - You want us to jump for joy because you're leaving? - No, but no long faces. - When are you leaving? It should be right now, but not before your farewell show. Sure, we must all be together for her success. Now we need a toast. Here, for lack of anything better. Happiness, girls! Long live our dancer. A toast! - To you, Mirella, my young athlete. - To your farewell show, Oliva. - Where's my powder puff? - It was on the table. Where did it go? - It's a right mystery. - As long as you're hanging onto it... - I don't know what I'm doing anymore. - You put the powder on. - In your honour. - Good evening Girls. - Hi, Mirella. - How beautiful - Thanks. - I was telling Oliva, not you. - Here are two gallery tickets. - Thank you. Giorgio's outside. Can he come in? He'd like to wish you well. No, please, it's not allowed? Go thank him. - All right. Good luck. Bye, Carina. - Bye, Mirella. - Quickly, girls They are waiting to take the photograph. - Oh, go. Come on, dear, go. Goodbye, Oliva. Pass me the binoculars, please. Oh, dear Baron, how are you? What a magnificent theatre, isn't it? A real feast for the eyes. - And you're a real feast for the eyes too. - I'm ready. - Give me that handkerchief. - Why, got a cold? - What are you doing? Are you crazy? - You're becoming like all the others... - All the ladies wear face powder. - You're different. - Oh, tonight... Come on, leave your face alone and listen. I have to talk to you seriously. - We'd better go or we'll be late. - No... - It's not allowed to stay here. Carina, they offered me a place in Sardinia, at the Carbonia mine. - Are you going? - It's very important for my future. I'll be there a year, maybe two, so I thought, since mum will be alone... you could be with her for a few days this summer in the countryside. You'd keep her company. I told her about you. She wants to meet you. - Giuliano... - She'll certainly love you. - So, do you accept? - Yes. - Did you say this summer? - Yes why? - Oh, this summer... This summer's not possible. - But why? - I've made some very important commitments. - With whom? - With me. Be frank with me. You hiding something from me. No, Giuliano, I'm not hiding anything. It will be better to go away. - Think of us. - Don't insist, please. Still here? The show is about to begin. - Yes, come on, Giuliano. - Hurry. - Bye, Oliva. - Don't worry, everything will be fine. - Good luck. - Applaud like mad. - You bet. Bye. I can't wait for the farewell show to begin. My legs are shaking. Fortunately, you're not dancing. You should have said you were coming. I'd have invited you to my box. - But I... - It doesn't matter, we'll see you tomorrow as usual. - Oh, you're here too. - I was invited. As a season ticket holder it's almost an obligation to come. - How dull to always see the same things. - Sometimes one sees the unexpected. Quite true. Even the gallery patrons in the boxes. - Bye, Alda. The show's starting. - Bye, Giuliano. We'll go to Gisella's later. Are you coming too? - Miss Alda can thank you that... - Quiet. The show's starting. Let's admire your friend. - Where's Oliva? I can't see anything - She's not there yet. It's the recital. Here, let's see what you've written. - Want to bet he'll come right away? - You're deluded. Look at them twirling. Giuliano has good taste. Not bad, the little girl. What nonsense. Tell the usherette to take this to Giuliano's box. Here, now it's her turn Delightful! She looks just like a feather. - You'll hurt your hands. - I've got thick skin. - I bet it was from Alda. - It doesn't matter. - Confess you regret not being in her box. - What's that? - That's what I think. - No, listen... - No need to sulk. I'll accompany you. - Don't bother. - No trouble. - Go to your friends. - Don't make me lose my patience. - Don't let's start an argument. - I won't make you look bad. - Thanks for a lovely evening. I'm going to Oliva. - Carina, listen... If Giorgio hadn't held me, I'd have fallen from the gallery. It went well? It made no sense at all. It felt like I was dancing in a dream. - Give her some air, girls. - Bravo, you were wonderful. - I even wanted to cry. - I owe everything to you, Carina. But you seem more moved than me tonight. You know, I think I had my farewell show too. - May I? - Come in. Are you sorry I've come to visit you? - You! - I was just passing and so... Please make yourself at home. Sit down. It won't be as good as at home. This little house is so pretty. A bit high though. - 315 steps. - Is that all? I thought there were more. - Well, I came to apologize. - Apologize? You to me? - Yes. Does that seem strange to you? - Somewhat. No matter. It means you've judged me worse than I am. I'm not that bad and I want to give you proof. Here. I hope you won't be offended. I know you're going through hard times. - What? - Nobody will know. And I do it wholeheartedly. Look, I appreciate your gesture, but I don't need anything. Got it? I'm sorry. Especially since I came to ask you for a favour. - In that case, I'm at your disposal. - Really? But I don't understand what kind of favour little old me can do you. Anyway, here I am. It's about Giuliano. - That is, you and Giuliano. - Don't worry, there's nothing between us. I know, if there had been something serious, Giuliano would have told me. - Better that way. - But, you see, what hasn't happened can always happen. I know Giuliano's family and I know how they think about certain things. So I came to warn you. Illusions are quick to form, but it's more difficult to shake them off. And, because I like you, I've come to offer you a trip at my expense. - A remedy taken in time can always avoid sorrow. - Enough! If you continue, I'll send you on a trip down my flight of stairs. You said I didn't know you well, but now I know you too well. Keep your money and go! Go! - A child? - One? Why one? Hopefully twins. - The wonders of the fairies. - That's right. And now that you have made this beautiful discovery, vanish! Clear off! I should have expected it! The affairs of Miss Carina don't interest me at all. I don't know why you came to tell me all her troubles. - With the baby... - Enough of that stupid story. A fine fool you made of me with your conversation. - Giuliano... - To hell with women and their feather brains. Don't be angry with me, Giuliano. will you dine with us tonight? Thanks, I can't. I've decided to bring forward my departure for Sardinia. - Wasn't that in August? - I've changed my mind. - When will you leave? - As soon as possible. Bye. - And leave me like that? Should I kiss you're forehead and thank you for the narrow escape? Luckily it is you who's leaving. Buses always flummox me. - I'm always afraid of being late. Here, see how it's done? - Yes. - What are you doing, are you crazy? Let me, I'm more practical. - May I? - He comes once everything's ready. - I've brought you a new pair. - Oh, thanks, you didn't have to bother. - The representative gave them to me. - Tell me how they go, if you feel like writing. - Of course. We missed these too. Come on, the bus won't wait. Giorgio, take the suitcase. I'll take care of the timber. - Come on, girls, let's go. - Mirella! - Giorgio, watch out: there's jam in there. - Yes, okay, don't worry. - Blast... - Wait... Oh, sorry, Carina, I forgot. The concierge gave me a letter. She told me that a gentleman handed it over. You could have told me the truth. I am like a brother to you and would even have helped you. Instead you've played a dirty trick. You are just an ordinary woman to whom I gave a great soul. Giuliano. Carina, are you coming down? Coming. Coming right now. Dear brother, I am returning the great soul which generously you gifted me. With many thanks Carina - Here, Carina. - Are you sure this is your bus? - Don't worry. - You've already asked a dozen people. - You know, these buses are all the same. - Suitcases? - They're on board, don't fret. There's a quarter of an hour still to go. I'm all on edge! - We'll buy you some magazines now. - Don't waste money on me. - Let's go buy you a bottle of water. - Thanks, I'm not thirsty. Okay, if you really don't understand, let's go buy you a romance. Okay, but come straight back. Let's hope that Giorgio decides to speak to her. Let's hope so. I'd be so happy for Mirella. - Giorgio seems like a good boy. - Bravo, he's a man now. - Got everything. - Everything, thanks. - Mirella, I must tell you something. - What? Those books I lent you, if you don't need them, will you return them to me? Yes, sure. If you want, they are in the suitcase. No, I don't need them now. Send them when convenient. I'm sorry you're leaving. I'll miss you very much. - Especially when it snows. The two of us were fine, right? - Yes. - You'll find a hundred better than me. - I don't think so. - Also, I've an idea I won't be making so many trips this winter either. - Why not? - If you promise not to laugh, I'll tell you. - Yes. - I've got engaged. - Engaged? You? And to whom? Do you remember that Miss Branchia employed in the stadium admin? - Congratulations. - Gentlemen, all aboard. - You're off. Where did those two get to? - Gentlemen, we're leaving. - Quick, give me the rest. It's leaving. Ah, here they are. - Here, Mirella. Instead of the book we got grapes. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye, Mirella. - Remember us and write. - Bye. - Have a good trip! - Bye! Sorry, I can't accompany you. I'm late and have an appointment. - Bye! - See you soon. Goodbye. Poor Mirella. She'll be a prisoner in that college. She who loved freedom so. The time for dreams is over. Yeah, that's right. The time for dreams is over. And to think that I should have gone too. I had to refuse an offer for the Bologna city council. - I don't understand. - The baby will already be born. I can't keep it with me. - Who offered you the contract? - My teacher. - I'll phone your teacher. - No, Carina, it's not possible. You don't want your little girl to have her mum unemployed. - Why does it have to be a girl? - Oh, enough of men. Look, Oliva, I'll take care of the baby. You and Mirella will be away and I won't have anyone. You've already sacrificed so much for us. You can't always go on like this. - I understand that Giuliano... - Oh, Giuliano, nonsense! - But if all these days... - I was wrong. I've dumped him. We weren't made for each other. Where's a letterbox? - Why? - I have to mail a letter. Personal business. Take no notice when she cries. "No notice". Just words Now I'll sing the lullaby, come. Lullaby, lullaby Go to sleep my little one. No chance. Now I'll pull a face. Look. No, this won't work either. Look, look what mummy does, look. - What are you doing there? - Sorry, I was trying to amuse the boy. - How's this illustrious character doing? - Well, he only had the hiccups. - Did you give him the lime water? - Yes, two teaspoons as you said. - Tell him it will do him good. - Yes, dear. - Here's the stuff for the new job. - Thank you. Here's the other finished. - Already done? You work too hard. - For me, work is fun. - How did the play go? - Don't talk to me about it. Bertelli has no sensitivity. When I play with her I can't get excited. It's a pity you don't want to act. Don't want to? I can't! How can I? I should go out every night. And if the baby gets a cold, I'd lose my head. I came to talk to you about just that. The accountant wants to enter the company in the Am-Dram competition. You must join us. We'll come and rehearse here in your house. And since I won't act, as there's no part for me, I'll look after the child. - I'll give up art and be a wet-nurse. - I don't want you to sacrifice... For heaven's sake Think, acting in a real theatre with posters on the street. - With your name this big. - My name on the poster? - Yes. All the papers will talk about you. By the way, I forgot. The accountant sends you this Resto del Carlino. - Read what he says about Oliva. - Ah, here, let's see. Much applauded the dances of the last Act in which the sweet vision appeared of the prima ballerina Oliva Mattei. At the Comunale of Bologna. I said that Oliva had to follow her vocation. - Yes, but if you weren't there to help her. - But that boy is partly mine too. - Aren't I your little mummy too? - But whoever thinks of everything is you. Don't say that. With Oliva and Mirella we're tied in a pact. We'd be ready for anything to help each other. We swore all three under the oak tree. Look. How cute all three of you are. And what a beautiful place. It was such a beautiful day. We told the forest nymphs all our wishes. - Then he appeared on the path. - Him who? It doesn't matter. He too is buried under the oak tree along with the wishes. Wake up, Giuliano, the car is ready. The plane won't wait for us. Coming, what's the hurry. I'm still packing, aren't I? - What's the rush. - You slacker. Think, in six hours we'll be in Rome. Going back home. You're as black as thunder. With being in the middle of all that coal. Say, there'll be some blonde waiting for you, right? No, you're wrong. Only octogenarian grandparents and old aunts await me. - Are these the old aunts? Will you introduce me to a couple? - Cut it out. I mean it and I'll can leave one for you. - Think I can guess which is the beloved? - Stop it. The car won't wait. This, the blonde. No. Then this other one. Eh, not bad. Ah, the little one. Little one? She comes up to here. - Say, do you like "drops"? - "Drops"? Yes, those unwrapped candies, with flowers painted on them. Well, she was crazy about them. Eh, but yeah, you can't understand. You know, she's a really strange girl. The more I know the others, the more I realize how different she is. With that air of teasing... Poor Carina, who knows what happened to her. - You didn't write? - No, it's been 18 months since I heard anything. - Well, let's go. - Don't get angry. One lost, another hundred found. - Leave it, I'll take it. - Thank you. Oh engine driver, load up the coal let that big engine fly Since you're all heart, you be nursemaid today. He's good with you. - Go on, dear. - Yes, give him to me. Lovely. Come on, now, all these excuses are only good for interrupting us. "What did Massimo want?". To you, Carina. "He made me read his friend's letter." - "You were only one day, right?" - "Yeah, that's right." - "Stay here". - "Let's talk a little..." - "Well, what's the use?". - "And mum knew?" - Listen, I can't act with the baby in my arms. The evening of the play I will have to hug a pillow to be natural. - I can't act like this. - Give him to me. - How you do it? - Here we are. - And those never wrote. - No, there's no such line. What line? I spent a fortune telegramming Mirella and Oliva. - I'm waiting for their reply. - Who knows if they can come. They're bound to come. Without them I don't feel I could act. - Here we are, I brought it with me. The whole city's talking about it - What's up? - And now you see it. One, two and three! - The poster! - The day of glory has come! - The poster! Look, darling, see? Carina Poncevera. It's me. Beautiful! You see, he understands everything? Let's see if we can see. Done. - Yes, but you have stand close. - No, you can see it from here too. - Even from here. - Even from here too, look. Tommy: son from first marriage. Evaristo Pelliccioni. - Sounds like a stage name. - "Nennele: Carina Poncevera". I am Poncevera. Poncevera, it's not a very nice name. - But very important. - Pelliccioni. - Poncevera. How beautiful. Remember, accountant, the first time we met? "The lady of the Camellias". Margherita Gautier, me, Amalia Giubilo. What times! - Thirty years have passed - Come on, it's 8 o'clock. - 8 o'clock? - 8:05! Mercy, my wife... See you tomorrow. - Goodbye. - I recommend: Sleeping, camomile and gargling. - Have no doubt. - I'll be here at six to look after the boy. - Don't forget: Gargle. - Have no doubt. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Evaristo. - Ah, Carina I forgot. Know who I saw in front of the warehouse yesterday? - Who? - So... what's his name? - Who? - That... That young man who always came to rehearsals... The engineer... - Giuliano! - Yes, Giuliano. You see he's back. Yeah, if it's here it means he's back, right? Well... sorry, I... I thought you liked him. - Why should I care about him? - Well, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Evaristo! - Coming. What do you want? - Look... - What's wrong? No, nothing, I wanted... I wanted to tell you... Here, I wanted to tell you that the accountant left his umbrella. - OK... goodbye. - Bye. "... get on my knees before him and see the love I bring him." "But there are times when... - Come in - Bravo. Inspired actors are recognized by their discipline. - You're the first to be ready. - I should think so, I've been here since six. Let me see. Turn. Perfect. - But I'm so flustered - Have you got the "track"? - "Track"? No, sir. Nobody told me anything. Otherwise I'd have bought one. No. It's the emotion that takes hold of actors before they go stage. I understand. A tremble in the knees, isn't it? Then I have it. What an audience! - Mirella and Oliva won't come - Yes. They'll want to surprise you. - Will the baby be alright? - Of course. Amalia's looking at him. Think about the play, now. The first signal. - Miss, a telegram. - A telegram? For me? It's Mirella "Holding training camp. Hugs and best wishes." - Then she won't come. - No, she's not coming. You know, the training. - Then Oliva won't come either. - Yes, you'll see, I'm ready to bet on it. - And another person will come too. - Another person? Who? Him, Giuliano, because... for now he is still here. He hasn't left. - Who told you that? - I spoke to his concierge. - Come on, get ready to go on stage. - The play! - Yes, coming. - Hurry up. - How many? - Six downstairs and three here... Nine. - Lucia - Miss? - How many suitcases are left? Three for the lady and two for the young master. I met her on the trolleybus yesterday, after leaving you. She's really nice. - She's a little plump, but... - Imagine, you finding her plump. And she has a friend. A youngster. You'd like her. We'll phone them tomorrow. - OK, tomorrow... - Of course there are some girls around... Yes, woman have liked me for some time. - Do you think 5 lira will be enough? - Do as you wish. - Shall we go? Are we going to Florida tonight? They have some wonderful numbers. - With all the adventures you have? - What do you want, man is a hunter. - Good luck. - Aren't you coming? - No I'm tired. I'm going home. - Worse for you. - Do you think 4 will be enough? - Yes. - Do you want to be my wife? - I don't accept charity. - You don't want to be? - No. - Can't you love me? - It's not that... I don't think you want me... like that. - You're leaving? - Yes. I have to go out... and walk. - Do you want me to come with you? - No... I need... to be alone. - Are you offended? - No. I'll go downstairs... for a walk. I didn't understand. - Oliva - Carina! I knew you'd come at least. When did you arrive? Quarter past nine. I saw the end of the second act. You were wonderful. The baby is doing so well. He's a flower. He's grown two pounds this month. Yes I saw him. I went home and talked to Mrs Amalia. She told me everything you've done for him. Thank you. For heaven's sake, we won't mention it. Will you stay a few days? Maybe Tomorrow evening there's "La Gioconda". I must take the midnight train. - I just want to apologize if I can't stay until the end. - It doesn't matter. Instead of coming you could have stayed with baby. You've not seen him in ages. I was in residence at Bologna: Prima Ballerina at the Teatro Comunale. Really? I'm so happy. I've taken a small flat, so you no longer have to sacrifice yourself for the baby. Sacrifice? What are you saying? For me it's my life. I know, but, see, it's my baby and it's only fair that I keep him with me. - So... you'd like to take him away from me? - Yes, Carina. - When? - Well, tonight. - Tonight? But I'll never see him again! What? You can come to Bologna and spend a few weeks with us. - Yes... yes... - And besides, you need to be free, for the theatre. You can't continue sewing all your life. But I was fond of him. He was everything to me. - I'm so alone... - Sorry, I'm so stupid. - I shouldn't have told you now. - No, it doesn't matter. - We had imagined everything so differently... - I know, Carina. Life is so different. Ours were the dreams of youth. And I believed them. You're on stage. Think of your success. You've ruined all your make-up. Come on, I'll take care of it. Don't forget... to give him lime water for his hiccups. It's on the dresser. In the third drawer of the dresser... there's a pink paper package. In there are the sweaters that I'd prepared for his name day. - One stalls, please. - There's one here in the front row. - No, too far forward. One at the back. - Back stalls. - It doesn't matter. Eleven twenty. What's wrong? It's the second time you've stopped. What are you watching? I thought I saw a man there under the trees. I must be mistaken: Between the moon and the branches... - There is someone. - Ah, you see him. Now he's standing still, he's in the shadows. No... no... You say it so sadly. Are you sorry no one's there? Who did you think it was? - Well... think who you like. - Ah, Tommy you thought - No, nobody. - You will no longer have bad thoughts. - Never. No longer think of leaving me. You must leave me one day... - We must hope so. I had hoped... - There! There he is. - He's approaching the hedge's shade, to hear us... Do you see him? - Where? There, behind the bush. Look at the shadow the moon casts. You see? He stayed. He was keeping watch. He stayed for me. He understood. - What are you saying? Who is it? - Do you want me to call him? Massimo! Come... - Carina! - Giuliano! I was waiting for you here. I wanted to go on stage, but then... - You could have done. - I didn't dare. We parted so badly the last time... Many times in Sardinia I started writing to you but then tore the letters up. I was almost afraid to hear from you, but when I saw you... - Saw me? - Yes, in the theatre. - In the theatre? But if I... I was at the back. I heard the last scenes. You were really good. - Too good. Will you give other performances? - I don't know, I don't think so. We do this every now and then to pass the time. We're just amateurs. - And... how's the child? - They took him from me. - Took him away? Who? - Oliva. - Oliva? Why? She wants to keep now. It's only right: she's the mother. - What? She's the mother? But then... - It's raining. But I've a brolly. Listen... now that you've no more commitments with your am-drams... I'd like to offer you an important part that's very close to my heart. - A part? For me? - Yes, Carina. Only you can play it in my life. And I need an answer immediately. I've suffered so much these last months and I couldn't suffer a minute more. I need to know... if it is not too difficult a part and if I'll be able to carry it through... I'm sure you will. It's such a beautiful and simple part. Listen. In Act I a slightly foolish young man and a plucky girl meet... Subtitles: corvusalbus
