Where is that thing, Disney's Family Singalong? [computer ringing] Oh. Ah. Hey, there, Seth. Hey, Kermit. What you doing, man? Oh, well, you know, I was about to watch the, uh, the Disney Singalong show and sing along. -[Seth] Cool. -What are you doing? Nothing, to be honest. Yeah, and I'm kind of getting a little... lonely. -[chuckles] -Oh, yeah, yeah. I know. I think we're all feeling that way these days. Yeah. I mean, I just can't stop thinking about how much, like, fun it would be if we could all, you know, just, like, be together again, hang out. Hmm. Well, don't worry, Seth. Sometimes, wishes do come true. It's time to play the music Oh. It's time to light the lights Yeah. It's time to sing along with Disney Singalong tonight It's time to put on makeup It's time to dress up right It's time to raise the curtain On the Singalong tonight Why did we have to call here? Now we're all on video How do we skip this intro And get on with the show? Sing along! Sing along! But now let's get this started Why can't we get this started? It's time to get this started On a most sensational, inspirational Celebrational, sing-elational Disney's Family Singalong song show How was that, Seth? Yeaaaaah! Yeaaaaah! And here we go. Happy Mother's Day, and welcome to the Disney Family Singalong. Ryan Seacrest here. We're so happy to be back in your living rooms for our second installment. After so many Disney magic moments were created with the last Singalong, we just knew we had to do it again. And this time, we do it paying special tribute to all the moms out there. So grab the family and get ready to enjoy the fun as tonight we celebrate some more beloved Disney classics. Again we've assembled an A-list lineup of artists and gave them the same task as last time-- to create something incredibly meaningful around their favorite Disney songs for all of us to sing along to. And as you're about to see, they've delivered some pretty extraordinary homemade entertainment. And because it's been a while and your pipes are probably a tad rusty, we're going to kick things off with a little vocal warm-up-- this time with the star who played Sebastian in The Little Mermaid on Broadway. It's Tituss Burgess. Tituss! Oh-- Oh, thanks, Ryan! [clears throat] And it is my honor to get everyone ready for the vocal gymnastics that you will no doubt be doing tonight. First, let's start with a slow tongue twister. Repeat after me. Mickey minces meat while Minnie makes magic magnificently. Ah! Not bad! Not bad! Those of you that did it. Just one last vocal exercise. Give me your best bibbidi! Give me your best bobbidi! Repeat after me. Salagadoola mechicka boola, bibbidi-bobbidi-boo. Put them together, and what do you got? Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo! Oh! Oh, dear. That was wonderfully, fantastically almost right. Remember to sing your hearts out. And if you're nervous about upsetting the neighbors, just do what I do. Turn the music up so you can't hear them. Back to you, Ryan! Brrrrrrrrrr. [laughs] Thanks, Tituss. That is the way you do it. I think we're ready to get the singalong started, and to kick things off, we have one of my favorite Disney songs, one with a message of positivity that we could all use about now. It's "Hakuna Matata," which means "No Worries," brought to life by The Lion King's Seth Rogen, Billy Eichner, and Donald Glover, plus young Simba from the Broadway cast, Walter Russell III. So pick your part wisely, kids. Are you a warthog, a lion, or a meerkat? It's a tough decision, but have some fun, and try and sing louder than Dad. Yes! Brilliant. That was so much fun. Thank you, guys. Now, I know there's a lot of princess fans out there, but the Disney villains are just as much fun. Like many of you, Rebel Wilson loves Ursula from The Little Mermaid, and tonight she's prepared a special singalong of the iconic "Poor Unfortunate Souls" from her native Australia. So, with this tune, you have my permission to get real over-the-top-- like snarl, growl, get super evil. But only for the next two and a half minutes because I don't want Mom mad at me. ["Poor Unfortunate Souls" playing] Chilling, but I liked it. Hey, what happens when John Legend and Jennifer Hudson join forces to sing "Beauty and the Beast"? We'll find out in a bit. Plus, Halsey, Christina Aguilera, Idina Menzel, and Ben Platt, they're all still to come. But right now, it's the stars from Disney on Broadway coming together to perform a special Mother's Day tribute with the love song between mother and son from Tarzan. It's the Oscar-winning "You'll Be In My Heart." ["You'll Be In My Heart" playing] Forever more, yeah What do they know? Yes, you'll be in my heart Now and forever more You'll be here in my heart I'll be with you I'll be there I'll be there Thank you to the stars from Disney on Broadway. Absolutely incredible. Now, of course, music might be food for our souls, but many Americans have been hit with unprecedented challenges during these hard times, so tonight, we'd love to share with you the amazing work Feeding America is doing. -Hi, America. -Hi, America. -Hey, America. -During this crisis... -Over 37 million people... -Don't have access... To nutritious food. That's one in 12 seniors. And one in seven children. -But the good news is... -We all can help... With Feeding America. Their network of 200 food banks are up and running... Distributing food to people and communities they serve... Across the country. To locate a food bank in your community. -Together... -Together... Let's feed the love. Hello, all of you lovely families around the world. 'Tis moi, Miss Piggy, the star of Disney's Family Singalong. Live with it, Seacrest. I want to take a moment to thank all of the heroes who have worked so hard to keep us healthy and safe. You deserve a great big socially distant kiss from moi. Here it goes. Mwah! [laughs] And remember, if I can go this many days without a stylist and still look this fabulous, then together, we can do anything. Ah, the always-humble Miss Piggy. Seven talented performers from Dancing With the Stars are on tap for our next singalong, and they'll be led in song by triple-threat actress-singer-dancer Keke Palmer. This one is guaranteed to get you off your sofa. So, from 1997's Hercules, it's time we go from "Zero to Hero." ["Zero to Hero" playing] Zero, zero He is a hero Hercules Hercules No one braver Our favorite flavor Hey, hey Oh, oh, oh, oh Zero, zero He's a hero Okay, Mom, how'd I do? That was great, but let's run through it one more time before you do it for real. Mom... Next on deck, we have one of the most popular, strong-willed Disney princesses ever to grace the screen. It is Elsa herself from Frozen, Tony Award winner Idina Menzel. Idina, it's so great to see you. How are you? I'm great. Hi, Ryan. Thanks for having me on. Happy Mother's Day, everyone. Yes, and thank you for being on the singalong. You have something very passionate that you are about to do. You're very excited about this. Tell us what you're gonna do on the show. Okay, I am going to do a duet of "A Whole New World." It's a song I've been singing my whole life. I actually used to sing at weddings and bar mitzvahs when I was younger. And I used to sing this song all the time. Tonight, I am going to sing it with somebody very special. It's Tony Award winner Ben Platt from Dear Evan Hansen -and The Politician. -[Ryan Seacrest] Wow. He's also a really good friend of mine and a lovely, lovely human being. Well, we're so grateful to have you with us. Thank you so much. Very exciting. So, families at home, sing it loud, sing it proud as we travel to "A Whole New World." -[Aladdin] Do you trust me? -Yes. ["A Whole New World" playing] With you, with you, with you, with you With you [Jasmine] It's all so magical. [Aladdin] Yeah. Stunning. All right, from one childhood favorite to another, our next singalong is from a movie about a headstrong mermaid who dreams of exploring the world above water. Now, for this one, you'll be singing along with multiplatinum artist Halsey, who just happens to be a massive Little Mermaid fan. ["Part of Your World" playing] Now, that is dedication, Halsey. Thank you so much. All right, so, now, it's time we hear from a very good friend of mine, someone who has truly committed to this singalong challenge in a way only she can. Here to perform the Oscar-nominated "Baby Mine" from the classic 1941 film Dumbo, it's Katy Perry, accompanied by someone who requires equal billing-- her poodle, Nugget. ["Baby Mine" playing] Mom! Dad! How you doing?! Fine, fine. We're watching Derek Hough. Is there anything he can't do? Yeah, no-- no, Derek-- Derek is great. So, listen, I'm doing this Disney Singalong thing, and I wanted to dedicate it to you, Mom, for Mother's Day. You just did a Disney Singalong thing. Yeah, I know, Mom. There's-- there's another one. That Derek Hough, he can do all the singalongs. Hey, I wonder who he's dedicating his performance to. I-I really have no idea. Probably his mom? She's such a lucky lady. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm gonna-- I'm gonna go sing now, guys. Happy Mother's Day, Mom! -Bye. -Love you. Love you. Okay. ["When I Am Older" playing] [gasps] [giggles] Shh! -What was that? -[giggles] Samantha. [chuckles] [all screaming] [crickets chirp, owl hoots] [laughter] Oh, I think he did his mom proud there. Now, our next talented Tony-winning artist is the princess in The Princess and the Frog. Tonight, she's recreated a song she made famous in her movie, but I'll let some of her biggest fans explain. It's her godchildren. My titi Anika Noni Rose is Princess Tiana. And she's going to sing "Almost There"... From Princess and the Frog. Chloe and Halle are gonna join in. You should, too. We love you, Titi. Yay! Well, I want for you, sweetheart, to meet your Prince Charming and dance off into your happily ever after. Those three sound so good together. What a treat. Now, you can't do a Disney Singalong without this next ballad, a duet which ranks among Disney's very best. And for it, we've enlisted two Oscar-winning powerhouses, John Legend and Jennifer Hudson. It does not get better than this. So, here they are, a musical dream team made complete by you at home, of course, with "Beauty and the Beast." ["Beauty & the Beast" playing] Oooh Oh, oh, oh, oh Ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh Mmm-mmm mmm-mmm Now, that is how it's done. Whew. So, what happens when you combine an optimistic rabbit, a conniving fox, a buffalo, a sheep, and a sloth? You end up with the 2016 Oscar-nominated Zootopia. Shakira sang its theme song, and she's here tonight to recreate the magic, so you at home try everything you can to keep up with the lyrics and have some fun. Hey, cast a few of your favorite stuffed animals as your background chorus and sing like you've never sung before. [gasps] -[barks] -Oh, it's you. You're gonna get me in trouble, Dante. Someone could hear me. I wish someone wanted to hear me. Other than you. Ew! [laughs] Que nuestra canción no deje de latir Solo con tu amor yo puedo existir Que nuestra canción no deje de latir Solo con tu amor yo puedo existir Recuérdame Recuérdame Recuérdame Que nuestra canción no deje de latir Solo con tu amor yo puedo existir Que nuestra canción no deje de latir Solo con tu amor yo puedo existir Welcome back. Derek and Julianne Hough, plus Derek's girlfriend and fellow Dancing With the Stars alum Hayley Erbert blew all our minds last time with their wildly inventive rendition of "Be Our Guest." And I'm very happy to report they're back. Will they outdo themselves? I'll let you be the judge and background vocalists. Here they are with not one, but two crowd-pleasing classics from Mary Poppins. [music playing] Step, step, step, step, step Step, step, step, step, step, step Step, step, step, step, step, step Step Oh Oui, oui. Hey, Jules! What do you say we finish this all together? Heck, yeah, D-Man. Oh! [music playing] [birds chirping] Well, to close out this evening, we have the perfect final singalong for Mother's Day. It represents the unique, unconditional love we share with all our own moms, particularly at this time when we need them most. Performed by Sabrina Carpenter and virtuoso pianist Lang Lang, it's "Your Mother and Mine" from Peter Pan. We dedicate this to every mom across the nation, especially those serving on the front lines. We thank you and we honor you for all that you do. Happy Mother's Day, and good night. [intro plays] Well, a mother, a real mother, is the most wonderful person in the world. She's the angel voice... that bids you good night, kisses your cheek, whispers, "Sleep tight." Your mother and mine Your mother and mine The helping hand that guides you along Whether you're right, Whether you're wrong Your mother and mine Your mother And mine What makes mothers all that they are? Might as well ask "What makes a star?" [playing music] [playing music] [music continues] [music playing] Ask your heart to tell you her worth Your heart will say, "Heaven on Earth" Another word for "divine" Your mother And mine Hey, yeah
