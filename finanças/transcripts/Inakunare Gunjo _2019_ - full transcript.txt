[Prologue] Promise me this, Nanakusa. The two of us will reunite. Where... are we? Kaidan Island. (T/N: kaidan means stairs) This is an island for the abandoned. If you want to leave this island, you have to find what you've lost. Her words seemed surreal. But I knew, without a doubt, that I belonged here. Kaidan Island. A population of around 2,000 people. One day, we suddenly arrived on this island. Life here is pretty ordinary. We live in a dorm. We each have our own room. Hey, take care. And caretakers cook for us. It's nice to be young. We stay in touch through one post-office in town. But... No one knows why we're here. Everyone lost their memory about this. Hey, look! I finally got the latest game. That took long. It took two weeks! Geez, these stairs are a bother in the summer. Okay! Let's go, Nanakusa! Come on, keep up! - Hey! - Morning. - Yo, Class President. - Stop calling me that. You skipped our meeting. I was there. Hey, look! I leveled up. Good morning. Sensei. (T/N: Teacher, Master of school or life) Kogure-kun is not here. (T/N: Kun - juniors, or used generally for addressing male peers) Don't worry. He will not come here anymore. Is that so? I still have his video game. Then, let's begin homeroom. It's four days until our music festival. Strange things often happen on Kaidan Island. I wonder if everyone accepts this island. Maybe there's no choice other than that. Anyway, I've never met anyone who hass tried to get off the island. - Hello. - Hello. Hey, Nana-kun. - Yes. - Perfect timing. Here. Thanks. Did you find what you were looking for? I have a theory about this island. I've never told anyone about it. I have no desire to solve the mysteries of this place. I'll probably never tell anyone. Manabe? I can't help but believe that this story began when I met her. [Go Away, Ultramarine] That is like, so outdated. [Chapter 1 I Manabe You] Where did you buy that camera? Good morning. We have a new student starting today. Manabe You-san. (T/N: San - title of respect to address a person of the same rank) I still don't agree. A sudden change of schools can be upsetting. It's not that I just don't agree to be here. No one agrees to come here. You need some time. Get used to your life here and find a way to make peace with it. What is this place? No one can answer that. Except the witch. The witch? Yes. A witch overlooks this island. I don't understand it at all. I'm here against my will. I have to live with it because of a witch? What if it was a king or politician? No. I still disagree. Find a way to escape while you're living here. It would be nice for us to study together again. Then, let's leave this island together. Promise? I am Manabe You. Nice to meet you. I couldn't accept that Manabe You was sent to the island. Now, I'll take attendance. Here. We can't discuss leaving the island. Why? These people have accepted life here. They gave up. It's not wrong to voice your goals. Words have the ability to hurt people. No words are infallible. It's rare to see you here at lunchtime. - Can I join you? - Sure. Usai-san, can you show Manabe around campus later? - Of course. - Thanks. Ask Mizutani-san anything about school. Hello. After I show you around, can you help us with our music festival? I can't promise. I'm leaving the island. Manabe. I'll do everything I can, but I can't make empty promises. Well, that's fine. I think leaving the island is great. Will you help me? Yeah. Count me in. I'm Sasaoka. - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. Your name? Hori. Hello. How do you know each other? We went to the same school. Really? Why are you supporting her? Because I can't play new video games here. Not even download them. - You can wait. - You don't get it. Spoilers flood the Internet super fast. Then just don't read it. That's like saying, "don't look when skirts fly up." - Impossible, right? - What do you mean? I don't, but others gawk at it. We can call for help. We were kidnapped, let's e-mail the cops. All e-mails bounce back as errors. We can't post on social media either. We can only receive information here. Unacceptable. What's unacceptable? The limits are vague. We live well on a beautiful island. This croquette is good. That's fine. But we have no control. We're forcibly confined to live here. Not us. Just you. Are you happy here? We are being spoiled here, and stopped trying to move on. Maybe we are far from happiness, but at the same time, we are far from unhappiness. Maybe the witch is protecting us. Up there, we have more classrooms. That's home economics over here... At least, we don't hurt any more. You believe that? Manabe You. I wonder what she is like. She is straightforward. Straightforward? A perfect straight line facing one direction. I don't get it. In other words, she's an idealist. I see. Likely to be abandoned. - Sasaoka-san? - No, I didn't do anything. Her string... Do you have another one? Class President. Do you know her? She is Toyokawa-san from middle school. We live in the same dorm. She joined the music festival. Doing what? She will be performing for the main program. I'll go find one. - There are none- - I know this. Yes! This is what I'm talking about! [To Mom] [Chapter 2 I The Witch] What do you mean by "abandoned"? Exactly as it sounds. Those abandoned by their lovers or their companies. Who abandoned us? I don't know. How's that even possible? This island is full of impossible things. To the Lost and Found's Area. Did you find what you've been looking for? No, I'm just showing her around. Actually, I have a question for you, Nonaka-san, about the witch. Do you know her? I can't say that I do. I want to get off this island. Please, tell me about her. The witch... is a pitiful person. Pitiful? Why? Because she must control this island. I wouldn't be able to bear that task. What's your name? I'm Manabe You. If you want to leave this island, you have to find what you've lost. That's the only way. What I've lost? That's a three months of memory. Come here when you find what you've lost. But this tower is often locked- [Lost and Found] Open up! Is anyone here? Excuse me? - Anyone? - Hey, Nana-kun. Manabe You. May I call you Mana? I have some questions. Have some juice first. I'll drink it. - Thank you. - It's delicious. I'm glad. You've been furrowing your brows. Do I do that? You do. I'm used to it now. It's a waste of such a pretty face. Nana-kun, you have to make her smile. Well, that's not my duty. What? Don't say that in front of a girl. Right? Can I ask for help with a letter? Let's enjoy some small talk. Watch it. Manabe is very persistent. We can't send letters off the island. Can't I take the ship back? - You can't. - Then swim? - Go ahead. - Can you swim? Just ask her yourself. - Her? - Yes, the witch. Can I see her? - Send her a letter. - Where? There's a stairway up the mountains behind the school. Those stairs take you to the witch's mansion. Then, post your letter in her mailbox. You're climbing? Yeah. There's a rumor that no one can climb to the top. Sure, Tokito-san was messing with you. Then, I'll find out by myself. Even if you succeed, what will you do? In that case, I'll talk to the witch. About what? You can't just abandon people like this. Manabe! It's getting dark. Somehow, it's strange. What is it? I woke up on a strange island. I lost three months of memory, and I find you here. Like me. I can't believe you're here. But I feel fine. You know, it feels natural. I should be more confused. Two years ago, when I said goodbye to you, I couldn't imagine walking with you again. Yeah. [From Hori] [Dear Nanakusa, Manabe is a threat.] I first met Manabe You when we were in the 4th grade. One day, we found a puppy bleeding in front of our school. "Poor thing", someone muttered unconcernedly. I felt the same way. But Manabe You ran up to the puppy and held it without hesitation. Her white clothes turned red, and someone mumbled, "How disgusting." But she said, "You'll be okay. I promise." Then she ran, looking straight ahead. She was beautiful at my eyes. [Chapter 3 I The Graffiti] [Dear Ms. Witch on the Hilltop] What time is it? Already too late to rush. I was writing a letter. - A letter? - Yes. - That's why you're late? - Yes. Graffiti was found on campus this morning. Someone drew a star and a gun in front of the stairs. The witch trapped the past on this island. Where's the future? Excuse me. Hey. You too? I skipped class, so I'm a suspect. Excuse me. You want to talk to the witch? [Toyokawa's Violin Strings] Ask her to connect us to the outside. The problem is that we're secluded. I'll live here if I'm free to travel. Cool idea! I think you're reaching. But it's life-changing. Violin strings, video games, we'll solve everything. To get off this island, we have to find what we've lost. They are crazy rules to begin with. Crazy? - You're still here? - We were waiting for you. - So, how was it? - What? - Were you accused? - Yeah, somewhat. Let's find the real culprit. Why did you say the rules are crazy? What we have lost, we have to find it, right? Can you explain it? If I lost something, where do you think it is? Well, it's not on the island. To get out, I must find what's not here? That's... Let's go over this. Is Manabe smart? Difficult question. - Whose side are you on? - What? It's the epitome of youth to see girls arguing. Arguing isn't their intention. No, I bet our Class President loves winning an argument. Be serious, Sasaoka. I am serious. In fact, I have a great idea. Spill it out, then. I think what we've lost can be found right here. - Like what? - For example... Love. What the hell? - It's love. - Anyways. If the Lost and Found has our lost items, then it should be an object that was carried with us. I get it. Our target is Lost and Found. But it's locked. Find a chainsaw. That's a crime. What was that for? Find who wrote the graffiti. Remember their message? What was it? "The witch trapped the past on this island..." Yes! It's cryptic, so they must know the witch! We find the culprit, then level up. [Find Culprit -> Find Witch] It's perfect. What do you think, Nanakusa-kun? Start with what we can without breaking the law. You're right. Let's split up and find the graffiti culprit. Yes! Follow me! I said, split up. I want to talk to Hori, see you later. All right! Anything you might have noticed? - No, nothing. - Any rumors? - Do you know anything? - I don't. Right, thank you for your time. Hey, do you know anything about this? Get lost. - The graffiti. - Sorry. Do you know anything? Got it, thanks. Sorry for dragging you along. I don't care about the culprit. I read the letter. You're right. Manabe is a threat. She'll put us at risk and I think she's a loose cannon. She's an idealist who will do anything for her goal. Is that why you're always by her side? [Mission!! Search a string] - Hey. - This is the girl's dorm. What are you doing here? It's tough being a man. There were no leads, so we're interviewing absentees. Toyokawa was absent. - Manabe is here? - Yeah. [To Mom] Manabe-san! Manabe-san! What happened? Manabe-san saw Toyokawa-san and... Said something to hurt her? Toyokawa-san suddenly started to cry. Hey! No boys allowed! Toyokawa-san? Are you okay? Why did you make her cry? I didn't make her cry. - Then why did she do it? - She was sad. Manabe! I have to go. - Where? - To see the witch. I found Toyokawa's letter. An invitation to her concert. [To Mom] - The festival? - No. It was addressed to her mom. A concert where she's from, in three days. I only asked if she wants to leave. I can stay by her side and listen to her. She's crying because she's sad. Why should I stop that? We have a bigger issue to solve. It's up to her to decide. Of course, but the island is deciding for her. If there's a way out and she doesn't go, that's fine. That's on her. But if we blame the island and do nothing, that's tragic. Yeah. That is tragic. But just as we have the right to pursue happiness, we're allowed to be unhappy. But... she was crying. I have to see the witch. If Manabe You disappears without a trace... Just like that day, two years ago. I'm moving far away. Just now... did you smile? - What? - You smiled. I'm happy that I spent time with you. But, anyway, was I just a nuisance to you? - I didn't mean that. - Then why the smile? I'm sorry. Promise me, Nanakusa, that we'll meet again. If we do, tell me why you smiled. I should've nodded or come up with a lie and tell her why I smiled. But for some reason, I couldn't do it. I still don't know why I smiled that day. [Chapter 4 I Scars] They found more graffiti. "You live inside a mirror." "What are you?" Nado did them. Yeah, I guess. I knew it was Nado. "You live inside a mirror. What are you?" Yes? Who's you? People like you. Why are they blaming you? I wasn't in class. - Only for that? - Yeah. I painted over it, it was weak. Why? I was just being playful. That's not funny at all. Toyokawa-san! You play the piano. I used to take lessons. I see. Excuse me. I'm going to see the witch. I'll make sure you can go back. Whether you return or not, that's up to you. You're strong. I don't see myself like that. I... When I arrived on this island, I was a little relieved. Why? I don't have to try hard anymore. Are you curious about the symbol? Do you know what it is? It's a Pistol Star. Do you know it? (T/N: an extremely luminous blue hypergiant star) My favorite star. If I'm asked what my favorite star is, it's Pistol Star. Who would ask you that? What's yours? Well, let me think. I like the Nemesis. Never heard of it. It hasn't been found yet. Maybe you're covering for someone? Mizutani Senpai. Toyokawa-san. Are you feeling better today? May I talk to you? My violin string, I cut it. A phone call? From a girl named Manabe-san. Sit. So, what did she say? She'll call later. Also, that she's going to the beach. The beach? Toyokawa-chan. Thanks. Why did you? To see how far I can go. It was true. I was rowing away, but I ended up on the beach. No. I hoped the witch would come stop me. No. Don't you think you're a nuisance to Nanakusa-kun? What? When he's with you, Nanakusa-kun... he's not himself. I'm sorry. - Give up. - Please! - No. - Please, help me. - Won't, can't. - You're my last hope. Listen, our regular shipment can't be rushed, and I can't make violin strings magically appear. I'm not a witch. A witch? Thank you! The witch. Did you catch any fish? I could've helped if you asked. I talked to Hori-san. I see. Nanakusa. Your perspective can change by meeting people, right? - What? That's abrupt. - If you don't like that, live like a hermit. But that can't be right. I get it, but your absolute belief in the right thing is a bit extreme. I don't get it. Your words seem complicated sometimes. [You live inside a mirror. What are you?] Can I reach the top? Sasaoka-san? What the heck! What do you want? What are you doing? You can't stop meddling, can you? [Dear Ms. Witch] - You're climbing? - Yeah. - For violin strings. - Please, wait. - My life can't be boring. - You can't. All right! Wait for me, Boss! (T/N: he is referring to the witch as a final boss of a video game) Stop pretending to be a hero. You are too insensitive, and you don't listen. Do you really think you're helping Toyokawa-san? What? Nothing. What are you trying to say? - There are no violin strings. - Don't say that. - Maybe so. - Even the witch may not exist. Why waste time- Is this all a waste of time to you? That's not true. You know what? You're a people pleaser. Will it stop? Who knows? Nado is the graffiti's culprit? No. I see. Did we go to the beach in 6th grade? It was 5th grade. You broke your leg in 6th grade. Do you remember the ice cream shop? The one with intense flavors. The best ice cream ever. Was it? We promised to eat there again. I don't remember. You can't forget promises. I'll try my best. If I forget, you need to help me remember. Then... Do you remember our promise of two years ago? Why you smiled? Tell me. You've got it wrong. We... didn't make promises. ♫ One day, if you reach this hand ♫ ♫ When that year will come ♫ ♫ Even if it never happens ♫ ♫ That day... ♫ [Please give me violin strings. Sasaoka.] ♫ What are you looking for? ♫ ♫ What day did you see it? From now on, I want to believe it ♫ ♫ You leave my hand, like a suddenly dream ♫ [Invitation] [Dear Mom] ♫ Slowly, disappear the darkeness ♫ ♫ Because the light is here for you ♫ [Chapter 5 I The Confession] Good. [Kashiwabara High School Music Festival] All finished? Is that done? All done. Good morning. Hey. - Good morning. - Morning. A bit higher. Good morning. I'll hold it. We want informations about the witch, please. [Violin performance by Toyokawa] Please help. Contact us with anything. Please take one. Hey! Go to school! It's the exciting music festival. That was the plan. Hey. Hello. Please take one. Toyokawa-san. - I won't give up. - Please, stop. I already gave up. Toyokawa-san. So youthful. Hey, watch what you say. It'll age you. So what? It's our privilege to watch over them. I think you should be more considerate. Like how? Try to play nicely with others. Being considerate is valuing others' opinions. Okay. I'll try. But... But? If you're too agreeable, you'll lose your strength. A hero always arrives late! You must be proud of me. So, where's Toyokawa-san? - You found them. - Yeah. Wait, what's wrong? Toyokawa-san won't be playing today. But she can. Look! She doesn't want to. I don't get it. - Class President. - The violin string, she cut it herself. She told me so in person. I'm sorry... I couldn't tell you. It was all for nothing? That's why I'm so lame. Addressed to every student. Make a paper airplane. I wonder if the witch is watching us. The stairs give a clear view. Yeah. Does she use the stairs or her magic broomstick to go to her mansion? What's your guess? What did you see? The opposite. No one uses the stairs. Us, witch, nor the postal worker. Kashiwabara High School Music Festival begins! Please, everyone, assemble in the gym. Leave me alone. - You're crying. - I'm not. - I thought you were. - But I'm not! Not everyone wants to be helped. When the string broke, why did Toyokawa-san cry? She was acting. No. I take that back. She felt so trapped that she had to lie. What am I doing? I shouldn't have found this. Yeah. You may be right. But maybe there's something you can do. I'll only hurt her. - She is already hurt. - I'll hurt her even more! Is that so bad? It's better when others know you lied. It's too painful to live with it. Hori-san. Thank you. I know you care about others more than anyone else, Mizutani. That's not true. I... just want everyone to like me. I'm a hypocrite. I found the strings. Not sure if you should have them. Tell me one thing. Why don't you want to play? Your answer decides if I leave. That's dramatic. I had an important concert. It was held in a huge venue. My friends and family came. But my string snapped. The music stopped, replaced by murmurs from the audience. Since then, I'm terrified to play in public. My mom said... "You can quit." I felt abandoned and all alone. "I won't quit," I told myself, and played again. But... but I'm still scared. I'm terrified that I'll fail again. So I turned my back. I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. - It's my fault. - No, it's not! We all turn our backs at times. I've done it all my life. From boredom, from myself. But that's not right. It's not! You have to trust me. I thought... your sound marked a new beginning. The music I heard that day, it was delicate and cool. - No, it wasn't. - It was awesome! I don't know about music, but... your sound changed my boring world. I want to hear it again. If you play using my string, I feel like I can change. Don't quit playing. You're so dramatic. Class President! Class President! - Hey, Nana-kun. - Hello. You walked here? Yes, in this heat, too. I helped someone's youthful struggles. Did you deliver my letter? Of course. By climbing the stairs? What are you asking? Are you... the witch? I guess. Of course not. I'm sorry. Why are you looking for her anyway? It's just a whim. Personally, I want you to leave her alone. So you're siding with her? Nanakusa. Hello. It's starting. Yeah. You changed since she arrived. Hey, over here. I'll be back. It's starting soon. Next up, a violin performance by Toyokawa-san from middle school. Go Toyokawa! Go Toyokawa! [Music Festival] You're listening out here? I don't like being in a crowd. That's too bad. That's a lie. I was avoiding you. Why? I talked to Manabe-san. What does that have to do with avoiding me? I talked on your behalf. On my behalf? I don't mind. I'm fine, as long as she didn't bug you too much. Why are you... always with Manabe-san? I don't have any reason to hang out with her. We met coincidentally, parted ways, and reunited. That's it. You'll be okay. I promise. Do you know Pistol Star? When it was found, it was the biggest star in the galaxy. But it's very far from the Earth, so we can only see its glimmer. Its light doesn't have to shine on me, but, knowing that it's out there in the big sky, a star that shines so bright, knowing that is enough. That makes me happy. It's not that I want to be by her side. But, I just want her to be herself. Simple and direct. A strong light shooting for the ideal. If I know she's out there, I'm happy. I... I don't want to see her diminished. Toyokawa! Toyokawa! Great job! Good job, Manabe! So, you like her. Thank you for this splendid performance. Awesome! You were just amazing! - Thank you. - You too, Manabe-san! - You too! - Calm down. Mizutani Senpai, sorry about everything. You were fantastic. You too, Manabe-san. Thank you so much. Likewise. I'm glad we played together. Me too. Thank you, Mizutani-san. - What? - You told me. Try to play nicely. That's why you played? Yes. See! Now everyone is happy. Great job, Class President! [I received your letter] The witch, right? I had no idea you were helping us. I'm sorry for what I've said. Wait. Are you crying, Class President? Shut up! Authorized people only! - I am. - You're not! But I am! Manabe-san, you can stay. - Sasaoka-san, not you! Go away! - It hurts! Don't pick on me! I'm not! Tokito-san! Have you seen Toyokawa-san? People sometimes disappear from this island. That's all. - Sasaoka. - I'm fine. I should've gotten her contacts. Do you think she found what she lost? I wonder what I lost. It's late. Get some sleep. I think it's time to say goodbye to Manabe You. [Chapter 6 I The Negotiation] [Lost items are nearby] [What are they?] [This is my final warning to the witch.] Excuse me. Nanakusa? Let's ask him when he's here. He wouldn't do this, right? Sensei. Is Nanakusa the graffiti's culprit? He wasn't feeling well, so I sent him home. Nanakusa! Manabe-san? To the Lost and Found. Did you find what you're looking for? I already knew it. From the beginning. Nanakusa! Wait! [Lost and Found] Did you find what you were looking for? No. I didn't lose anything. But, I know what Nanakusa lost. People here were abandoned by themselves in the real world. I abandoned myself, right? As people mature, they throw away characteristics that take life on Kaidan Island. We did this to ourselves. We tossed ourselves into the garbage bin. Nanakusa took his pessimistic self, and abandoned it on this island. That's me, right? You figured it out. How can we cut away a piece of ourselves? I'm a witch. So, you can return us to ourselves? Yes. It's possible. Do you want to return to where you came from? No. I have no regrets about this island. But there is one thing I cannot forgive. Did you receive my letter? Yes. I'm sorry I haven't written back yet. That's fine. Just answer me now. I wrote this island's secret as graffiti. I tried to convey secrets that you don't want people to know. [The witch trapped the past on this island. Where's the future?] The future is off this island. [You live inside a mirror. What are you?] We are abandoned souls. [Lost items are nearby. What are they?] The lost items are ourselves. I can write something far more damaging. You don't want people of this island to know the truth. Right. I want to protect these people. Then... Can you grant my selfish wish? Manabe... Manabe You... please send her home. Climb the stairs. Whether it'll be salvation or not, you'll find what you need. Why are you here? Did you write the graffiti? Yeah. Why did you? - No reason. - Don't lie. You hate it. Being a nuisance to others. You must have a good reason. It's just graffiti. I did it, got caught, and got scolded. No. I know you. You're secretive, you lie, you're mean, you're elusive. - Are you picking a fight? - And... You're very kind. No one is as kind as you. That's why I'm worried. That's not true. I feel exhausted being nice. I give up easily. - On everything. - No. You're the only one who didn't give up on me. It was pitch dark. A light bulb could've helped me, but I didn't have one. That's how I felt for two years. And I always thought of you. Nanakusa, you always shined a light on me. You protected me. What are you doing? I can't let you suffer alone. I won't allow it. Let's climb the stairs. [Final Chapter I The Promise] Manabe. We're complete opposites. I'm a pessimist. You're undeniably an idealist. That's why I deny you and hurt you. We shouldn't be together. For me, Manabe You... was my Pistol Star. Somewhere in this world, under the ultramarine sky, I want her to shine. That's all I wanted. Honestly. Nanakusa. There's no such thing as people not belonging together. Two years ago, I know why I smiled. I felt relieved to separate from you. Why? Because that's my ideal. Without you, I can accept this place. I can call this place paradise. You should leave this island. Promise me, Nanakusa, that we will... meet again. Promise me, Manabe, that we... will never change. Goodbye. Go away... ultramarine. [Epilogue] To be dramatic, I wanted to protect my Pistol Star. I guess that's why I was blamed for the graffiti. I'm sorry. We're similar. In what way? It's like we avoid love. That's pessimistic. But it's the truth. I wonder... I'm going. I hope that you have no regrets. Thanks. - Hey. - Morning. Good morning. Let's do some fireworks today. - Nice idea. - Why, though? No reason. - Or barbecue? - Nice idea! No need to worry about me. When Manabe came to the island, she lost three months of memory. I also arrived three months ago. And... the uniform she wore when she arrived was the same as my old high school. Before we reunited on the island, we met again in the real world. That's why I abandoned myself. Before... my pessimism would hurt her again. But, Will you promise to come with me? Why was she sent to this island? I will never know. And I don't need to know it. Manabe You is gone. How? We promised to meet again. I didn't agree. Yeah. I decided for us. I made a promise, and I kept it. Weren't you leaving? What's the point in me leaving alone? Because... I... I finally figured out why I came to this island. Why? You abandoned yourself. Because you always leave me behind. But I need you, Nanakusa. The one standing in front of me. Nanakusa, you don't want me here? I'm glad to see you. Good. There's something that I can't accept. That's why I had to come back. Because for me, it's the most important. What is it? It's about you and me. I don't want to believe that we can't get along as we were, because that makes it seem like we were unhappy before. I want to prove that wrong. So please, if it's no trouble, prove it with me. Channel Manager: annarofes_298. Thanks to our Chief Segmenter: valneijr. Thank you english team: grace_senpai91, planetjieun & cerejacult.

Fine, I guess I'll join you. ♫ Beyond your shadow ♫ ♫ There's something there ♫ ♫ Even if I turn back ♫ Manabe. ♫ You're not the real one ♫ Manabe-san! ♫ I go towards you ♫ ♫ And swim in the dark sea ♫ ♫ I can see through the waves ♫ ♫ A lighthouse that shines in a straight line ♫ ♫ I'm heading for you ♫ ♫ In the small diameter at dusk ♫ ♫ In the dark night sky ♫ ♫ Like a shining star ♫ ♫ Now, I'm traveling through ♫ ♫ A long time a vast sky ♫ ♫ You're breathing ♫ ♫ I'm trembling with a sigh ♫ ♫ I want to see you ♫ ♫ Overflows from within me ♫ ♫ Sorrowful ♫ ♫ I'm going beyond my premonition ♫
