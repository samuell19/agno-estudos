Yes, leaving this morning. No, it must be on platform 47 in fifty minutes. Paradise Hotel. Oh yes, Mr. Dale! Tell Mrs. Dale I'll be glad come for lunch. Of course yes. Well, we'll have to finish this business. next time. But thanks for asking. He wants to know what's up with his application. If you didn't go so far he would be glad to see you at lunch today. I want to go with you, Frank. Well, listen, Paula. I'm just taking a week off. And when did you decide what do you need holidays? A few days ago. - Do not do that! - How not to do it? Look, you just drop everything and you run away. Isn't that cause for concern?! - I'm just leaving town for a couple of days. - You're leaving me! - How can you not understand? Sorry, I really don't understand! We'll talk when you get back. Paul! Excuse me, are you Mr. Bigelow? Yes, but we are closed. I'll be back in a week.

Wonderful. Are you Reynolds? Sign here. If you want to catch the train, hurry up. I'm already going down. Five dollars from you. - Thanks a lot! - My pleasure! I changed my mind about returning to Sydney by train. Can you drop me off at the airport? Of course, get in! Today is sunny. And why did I decide to go by train? I could take a car... or take a plane. If change.... If you have fun... Would you like a drink? Frank, I feel that if you If you take the train, you will never come back. I'll be back in a week! Six years! What would happen if we got married? It wouldn't work. Marriages never lead to anything. Maybe others, but not me. But you could at least try... Looks like you offered a drink. Well, I have to go. See you in a week. You finally did your thing and I can leave the country. In fact, I should get off the ground yesterday. You restored my trust Mr Phillips. If we didn't get it I would have killed you. That's what I would do if you weren't so young. Of course, it made me softer. I believe that the rest deserve their share. - As you want? - One hundred thousand dollars. I'll give you sixty. It costs well over a hundred thousand. Maybe. But that's if you set the price yourself. Eighty thousand. Sixty! Don't be a child! If you don't sell you'll have to take it back. You know, you look younger at this age, what I looked like. And more, Mr. Phillips! Keep that money close to you. In case of any complications. I mean real complications. - Jaster! Yes, Mr Taylor? - Hasn't he returned yet? - No, sir. So why not? Find it! Eugene Phillips co-comrades. INVESTMENTS Mr. Halliday in the office? - He's late, he'll be back tomorrow. - When did he call? - In the morning. - Miss Foster! - Yes, sir? What time did Stephen leave? An hour and a half ago. Yes, Mr Phillips! - What? Can I go for lunch? Several colleagues are waiting for me. Oh sure! Enjoy your meal! You brought me 60 thousand... Have you traded? Now I will! Yes, sir? I booked a room for Frank Bigelow. Yes? I'm listening, sir. I'm Mr. Bigelow. I ordered a number. Yes, Mr. Bigelow, we have prepared for you great place. Is it always this fun in here? - Yes, all the time! - Mr. Bigelow. Number 124. - Over here, sir. Is there anything else I can help with? - Yes, bring me some scotch. - A bottle? Yes, a bottle. Oops, sorry about that! Hello! Hey Frank! How did you get there? - Excellent! - Having a good time, I hope? It's hard to say, I just moved in. What's this? Vacationers play outside the window. Judging by the sound, there are predominantly women. You don't waste your time. Yes, I will. Yes, I can imagine! - Are you calling just to say that? I only call on business Mr Bigelow. Can I give your number to Mr. Phillips? Eugene Phillips from Sydney. Phillips... I don't remember that name. Tell him I'm not available that I'm on vacation. He wanted to meet you immediately. He says otherwise it will be too late. Call him back. If it's so important then he will wait for my return. Can you send pajamas? No no. I will still send... Have a good time! Yes, thank you Paul! I will call you tomorrow. I didn't mean to interrupt your conversation. That's why it slipped away. Don't think stupid. - But for what? - He jumped under the bed. - What's there? - Ball!.. Maybe you can get it? Oh sure! He is under the bed. - Who? - Ball! I'm sorry, but it seems my wife came in here. - I... - No, not you! Oh Sam! This is my husband, Sam. -- Frank Bigelow. - Hello, Frank! - Are you having fun? - Just get the ball. It turns out, fussing with the ball and the bed fun as good as a double martini. Would you like a double martini? Why not? Sorry sir! I brought duct tape. Ah, thanks! Ah, boy! Under the bed is a double martini. I meant the ball under the bed. Could you get it? Oh Sam! Why didn't you guess? Why didn't you think of it? Why don't we go for a drink? Why not? Make me a double martini! I'm sorry, but Mr. Bigelow is at the dance. Listen, this is very important. Please convey my message to Mr. Bigelow. Yes Yes. Everything is correct! From Sydney. Number 9691643. Phillips... Yes, tell him I'm waiting. Yes? Listen! I already told you that the deal was made in accordance with all the rules. I'm losing my patience, Mr. Phillips! Are you trying to sell me my own property. I... I... told you that I have a good reputation. I will make you dead too and your sucker. You sold me what you stole from my safe. Now you must return the money! I cant! The next time I contact you I want to hear the correct answer. I cant. When you called in the afternoon, I had already returned the money. He left. He doesn't have the money, Chester. Call Phillips back, I want to see him. I feel my dear nephew trying to fool me. What do you think, Marla? Good evening! Mr Bigelow? No, he's not here. He'll be back at nine o'clock with friends. They were going to go to the Pink Panther bar. Come on, take it all off! She is too shy. I either do everything twice as fast or not at all. Sam knows! Come on, Sam! Tell him! Tell! - I'm not involved in this. - See? He knows! You don't know, but he knows! Do you understand what I mean? Look at me Frank! Is it better to go there? Tell me! What? Shoot! Take off everything! Wow! Take a look at this! What big cups! - Sorry! - Where are you? I'll be right back. - Are you ready? - Of course I'm ready! I'm ready for anything! - Yes, sir? - Scotch with water, nothing else. - She is one? - Oh sure. As usual. She always comes alone. Looking forward to a great meeting. Like all the girls of her type she comes alone. - Can I buy you a meal? - Thank you! Leo! - Will you drink? - And get my glass from the bar, Leo. Haven't we met before? I don't think I've been here before. - This is not my glass. - Of course yours. It's what you ordered. - My tape? - Well, yes! Refresh. As you say. You didn't like the way they cook here? - Yes, probably not. - Then why did you stay here? - I have nowhere else to go. - Ah, I understand! You are lonely in the big city. If you want to escape from the ordinary, then I'm ready to keep you company. Where is Frank? Hey, you! Get off the stage! - I think we should move to another place. - Let me think about it. Some people do it without thinking. - Let's meet later. Good. Where? Call this number. This is the next stop on my schedule. Give us a call and we'll get to know each other better. - Let me think about it. Hey Frank! How do you like it? "I sent you pajamas. Paula" Morning order, sir. - Have a good rest, sir? - Yes, thank you! Pencil! - Thank you sir! Would you like something else? - Not. Thanks to. Hey wait! - Take it away. - Is something wrong, sir? Just take it. I can't even look at it. Is everything all right, sir? Yes. Looks like I had too much fun last night. I just need to catch my breath. MEDICAL CENTER You are in great shape! The blood is normal, the heart is wonderful. If everyone were like you, doctors would have no one to treat. I'm glad about it, but still a little worried. Are you a little worried about your stomach? No change for the better? It looks like heartburn... I do not even know... The pain is felt... It's like they put something in my drink this night. Impossible. But let's look at the throat. Well, let's take another minute. I'll see the results now one more test. - Here, doctor! - Thanks to! Mr. Bigelow, this is Dr. Shaper. - How do you feel? "Would you like to sit down, Mr. Bigelow?" - Judging by my information, you are not married yet? - And there is. Do you have a family? Or relatives? Or some close ones? No, nobody. Where do you live? - But why are you asking? “You are very ill, Mr. Bigelow. But you said I'm in good shape. Yes I know. But the initial examination did not give a complete picture of your condition. You say so like there's something serious with me, doctor. Incredibly serious! I want you to clearly understand that what do we tell you. - We are absolutely sure of it. - Are you sure of what? It might shock you a lot. Mr Bigelow. What are you trying to tell me, doctor? Found in your body illuminating metallic poison. deadly poison, affecting internal organs. - Deadly poison? - Your organism is totally amazed by it. It's hard for us to admit it too. Mr Bigelow. That is why we have been preparing you for so long. We are eager to do our best. But I'm afraid we can't do anything. For this type of poison there is no antidote. You don't have long to live, Mr. Bigelow. Two days... a week... two weeks... hard to say for sure. Incredible! I don't believe! I don't believe anything you tell me. You probably made a mistake. This is definitely a mistake! After all, you could be wrong, right? Answer! Doctor Shaper is the best specialist in toxicology. There's no mistake here, Mr. Biglow. Do you understand what you are talking about? You say I'm dead! And you want me to believe that my life is over just on the basis a few words? I don't know what you're an expert in but I don't believe you! Please be smart, Mr. Bigelow! Together with an assistant we will make everything possible... Assistant?! Fuck me your assistant? .. You are crazy! Or just a couple of scammers! HOSPITAL Brace yourself, okay? Your body has already begun to die. Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure there is no error? Take a look for yourself. Illuminant particles glow in the dark. Usually they are not present in the body. But I don't feel terminally ill. Just like an upset stomach. Maybe... Maybe it's not so bad how do you think? It's all temporary... The deterioration may come on suddenly. You until the last second you can feel good, and then... What then?.. Speak to me directly, doctor! It all depends on many factors - the effect of this substance is individual. Do you drink... alcohol? Yes. Well, considering your lifestyle, everything has to happen all of a sudden. A day... two days... maybe a week. One day?.. Two days?.. Now it is impossible to be more precise. If you want to be more precise, then they must stay so we can watch... Where could you pick it up in the last twelve hours, Mr. Bigelow? Don't know. Do not know? Do you know where they drank the poison? -Not. But it couldn't have been an accident. Someone slipped you this thing. And he knew he had to somehow dampen the taste. It was possible to introduce poison into your body with alcohol, with it, the taste is imperceptible. I was drinking last night. You need to be hospitalized immediately. And of course I must report to the police about the murder. About murder? You must realize this, Mr. Bigelow. You have been killed. ...given your lifestyle, everything has to happen suddenly... One day... Two... Maybe a week... ...Someone gave you poison... ...If you want to know the exact date, then they must stay so we can watch... ...you must have swallowed it over the past twelve hours, Mr. Bigelow... ...You must realize this, Mr. Bigelow. You have been killed! "THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE" "INVEST TODAY FOR THE SAKE OF TOMORROW" ...This is not an accident! Someone slipped you this thing... ... You could inject poison into your body with alcohol, with it, the taste is imperceptible ... ... You were killed! .. It's closed here. We open at 7pm. Leo! Where is he? - Who, mister? - Leo is your bartender! Understand mister we're closed. You'd better come in the evening. I do not need problems! If you don't leave I'll have to call the police. ...Look at me, Frank! Just look at me... ...Frank, look at me!.. - You're ready! Frank, look at me! Yes, he just left. Yes, he looks sick... Sick all over! Open the door! Where are they? Where is Sam? The people who were here last night... I dont know. Please go away! There is no one here. Mister! This couple left the hotel. Have you left? Excuse me! I'm terribly sorry! Where is the note? - A note? - Phone number on a piece of paper... I don't know mister I'm just cleaning my rooms. - Where's the scotch bottle? - There was no bottle in your room. If you want a drink, go to the bar. It doesn't really work yet, but... Hello! Mr Bigelow! My eardrums are about to burst! - Hello, Paula! - You're bothering me. Why didn't you call back? Sorry, I... I've been busy. - Something serious? No, nothing special... Then your apology doesn't seem convincing. Yes Yes. Listen, if you're lying then I'm going and I'll come immediately. Not! So you're not alone there? Of course I miss... I just can't speak... We'll call you later. Okay... Wait a minute! Mr. Phillips called again. Phillips? Yes, it's a man who is trying to find you. I'm afraid we won't know what he wanted. He was found dead in the office yesterday. Frank!... Are you still on the line? - Died... when? - Yesterday. - And the cause of death? -Don't know. People die from a lot of things. I don't understand why you're so upset about it. You weren't familiar. Where is his office? What's the difference now, Frank? I'm telling you, he's dead. Stop talking and give me the address! As you say! The address is 340 Halty Square. Paul, listen! If you want to contact me I'm in a Sydney hotel. Mr. Phillips had a manager or a deputy that I could talk to? - And on what question? - Renting a mansion. I think Mr. Holiday can help you. - Who is it? - Press secretary. - What is your name? - Bigelow. Mr. Bigelow wants to see you. Good. Let him come in. Please, come in! - Mr Holiday? - How can I help? Mr. Phillips called me yesterday at the office. Why don't you know? Well... Mr. Phillips died yesterday. - Yes, I know. - I do not understand, who said that he called? My secretary took the call. I'm afraid I won't be of any help to you. I don't know why Mr. Phillips was looking for you. - It's a pity that you've made such a waste of time. How do you know it's been a long journey? I didn't tell you where I came from and my office may be in Sydney. Miss Foster, come in for a minute, please! Yes? Mr Phillips was talking yesterday with Mr. Bigelow when he called to the Paradise Hotel? I called the number four times who gave meand in Mr. Bigelow's office... ...but Mr. Bigelow was not found at the hotel. I'm sorry if you misunderstood me. Did he explain why he wanted to call? - Not. Good, thank you! You have to understand what's going on here. in some disarray. We are still in shock from sudden death Mr Phillips. Maybe one of the relatives Mr. Phillips will explain to me? I don't think, Mr. Bigelow, that people need to worry in such a difficult time Just to satisfy your curiosity... - It's not just curiosity! - Give it a week... I cant! You'll have to. I'll still get the information I need in city government. You are very aggressive, mate. Are you really sure that it is so important... - It is important! Mr. Phillips rented an apartment on Dicoreint. Thank you! But I have to say, it's pretty weird. I hope you will be more calm there, than they showed me. Mr. Holiday, how did Mr. Phillips die? Suicide. He jumped out of the apartment window. Come in, Mr. Bigelow! I am Stan Phillips, Eugene's brother. Holiday warned you to come. This is my half-sister, Mrs. Phillips. I offer my condolences Mrs Phillips. I'm afraid I can't help you, Mr. Bigelow. I don't know what my husband wanted to talk to you about. It's clear. I believe Holiday has explained everything to you. Mrs Phillips! I just want to know, how did your husband know about me. No. I don't know where Eugene is from learned your name. Look, it's certainly none of my business, but it's very important to me. Why did your husband commit suicide? You are not the most diplomatic person Mr Bigelow. Are you friends with my brother? I've never seen him. I'll walk you to the elevator. My brother is having problems. Big problems. Can you explain which ones? - You'd better go to the police. - He was involved in illegal transactions, so calling the police is not a good idea. What kind of illegal transactions? Trading. He was drawn into them some person unknown to me. Was it you? I already said - I haven't met your brother. This is true. Then what did you do? What connected him to you? Don't know. Let's get it clear together - together think about why my brother looking to meet you. Not! Then apparently it's not that important to you. If you think so then ask your questions to the devil. Well, you made me laugh, I almost died! Hello! I already thought you were lost. Why you do not want, for me to rush to Sydney? I can't explain it, Polly. I need to figure something out. What's the matter, Frank? You are not yourself. I guess I'm just tired, that's all. I'm glad you called. I miss you! Oh Frank! You never said those words to me. I've already begun to think that has lost all charm. When are you going to come back home? I'll be home... soon. Good! I will dress for your receptionZdu new dress. Guess what's the news? I found Phillips' last name on a copy of the contract, printed our Florida car. What's the deal? Money Transfer Agreement by George Reynolds to Eugene Phillips... ...for shipping a batch of RUTXW2. What does it mean? I remember George Reynolds. Thank you! - See you, Paula! - See you! Operator!.. Contact me again with the subscriber. Yes, to the hotel... Frank Bigelow! I want to talk to you, Mrs. Phillips! Please, I need to be alone! - I found the reason why your husband tried to contact me. Come in! What do you know about George Reynolds? George Reynolds? Looks like he sued my husband for the supply of uranium. What was Reynolds' claim? What the husband sent to Reynolds is gone. But we sent both uranium and lithium. Or your husband forgot to do it, getting money from Reynolds? We have fulfilled our end of the bargain. - Oh sure! - My husband did everything. But the item is gone. Thank you Mrs Phillips for your help! But it's still not clear What part of this puzzle do I occupy? - Do you know where Miss Foster is? She went down to the restaurant. It's on the 47th floor. Thank you! Miss Foster! Mr. Phillips called someone else before me. Why not ask Mr Holiday? I think Mr Holiday was gone yesterday or he's deaf because he doesn't know that Mr. Phillips called me. But you were there and you know who and whom called! I don't think it's your business. I know Mr. Phillips called someone else. Mrs Phillips told me. Mrs. Phillips couldn't tell you that. - How do you know? - Mrs. Phillips didn't know anything! Isn't it? .. And why Mrs. Phillips didn't know anything about it? Wait a minute! I'm talking about George Reynolds. Who are you talking about? Who shouldn't Mrs. Phillips know about? Phillips has been killed, Miss Foster! Killed? Since he tried to call me, a stranger, He certainly didn't intend to commit suicide. Just be honest! Why don't you tell the truth? I'm not going to cover for anyone. I'm leaving! Listen to me! You'll have to, or I'll make the case public! If you don't say anything I will speak! Unless, of course, they stop me too. Not! Mr. Phillips called Marla Stevens. You saw her yesterday morning. - Who is Marla Stevens? - She is a model. She is a secret friend of Mr. Phillips. When he returned very upset.... ...then asked to contact you. When it didn't work out he went to her house. This is the last time I saw him alive. Where does this Marla Stevens live? 19th building on Essiket Street. I don't think Mr. Phillips felt some risk from being friends with Marla Stevens. Anyway, he asked not to tell anyone about it. But I didn't think that because of this may have problems. I think it was prudent, Miss Foster. You and Stanley must be good friends. Did you know what his brother is aboutdesperately looking for me but carelessly continued to waste time. And I find out about it only by visiting Mrs. Phillips in her widow's apartment. Miss Stevens? Yes. What are you doing?! Get out or I'm calling the police! Go ahead, call! Are you going on a trip? Yes, I'm leaving for the weekend. With suitcases? "Be in Buenos Aires tonight..." That's the weekend! It's just a postcard... And now - get out! Are you leaving with George Reynolds? Never heard of such a thing. Have you heard of Eugene Phillips? Who are you? Where is Reynolds? I already said - I'm not familiar with this. Now go away and leave me alone! So you don't know him? Just don't say it's not him! I saw him! If you think I'm afraid of you, you are an idiot. Yesterday, after Phillips spoke to you, someone pushed him out of a sixth floor window. - Pushed out? - Your friend killed him! And I'll prove that it's connected to the sale of uranium into which Mr. Phillips dragged me too! OK then! Throw the picture on the bed. And turn around! Hands up! Frank Bigelow. And I'll take this! So pretty! Now, where is Reynolds? - I dont know. - Phillips contacted you to find him? Yes, but I told him I didn't know. - Who is Ryan? - That's his nickname. - Do you understand? - Yes. I understand perfectly, Miss Stevens. Your Reynolds would be a better nickname Phillips' Secret Partner. Phillips made a deal because both wanted the same thing. Yes ... But it is unlikely that he received in the end what what he wanted. This picture is of my friend, George Reynolds. I would like to know his address. I work here with a partner. But is this your picture? Everyone spins to survive. Buy this picture? Twenty dollars? Angelo! Did you take this picture for George Reynolds? I did, but I don't remember anything else. This gentleman is his friend. He wants to know the address. How do I get the address? Your friend will pay you twenty dollars. This paper was delivered last year. Are you sure that this information worth twenty dollars? We made a deal. It looks like you lost your money. We don't have an address. It was an on-demand order. You don't seem to be very close friends, mister. After all, he came from Reuland-Ahlen. Wonderful! Thank you! Bigelow? What's wrong with you? Everything is fine? Can you help with something? No. Do you recognize this person? No, I don't. His name is Raymond Taylor, I believe. - Never heard... - He used the name George Reynolds. Reynolds? Eugene mentioned one. - Do you know his address? - Not yet. Well, Holiday, you're in control here... In that case, I can't understand why didn't you know about themdeal. Phillips made the deal himself. Would like to know what kind of deal. Phillips saw fit don't tell me about it. And now - get out! In the morning you tried to move me important information to enable our partnership. But before starting you should have known me better. So go back where you came from! You really scared me, Khaliday! Hello! You promised to call. I've been waiting for two hours now. I'm sorry... I was... really in a hurry. Don't run away so fast, at least this time. True, your flight allowed me sit over books. But I can't say that he made good use of his time. Yes, I did something but that won't help pay the bills. Didn't I tell you to pay, Paula? - You are drunk! - How much do we have in the bank? Twenty-two hundred dollars. Take them off tomorrow. And what to do then? Pay the bills? Pay your bills. Do you remember we were going to do floriculture? You're definitely drunk! - Get busy! - If you had told me this two days ago, it would have had an effect. - Paula? - What? I would never leave you. I just realized now how much I love you! Oh Frank! Expensive!.. I love you too! I miss you terribly! Please come back! I will do so. I'll be back, Paula! Move! I like sending people to heaven. Look at me and keep your mouth shut! If someone crows unnecessarily, have to bleed. Did you take the picture? Can I keep it for myself after all? How did you find out about all this? - I was looking for Raymond Taylor. - Why? Since she told you about me, then you are aware. You don't think that I swallow everything what she talks about. You pry into my business. And I want to know the reason. The only reason is Raymond Taylor. Don't show off! I can't wait for an excuse to take care of you. He won't stand it. Too soft. See. See? You hit Chester?! - I'll cut off your hands! - No, Chester! Take a look! He's afraid of what Chester said. He's not afraid of you, Chester. I see no fear in this man's eyes. Stay away from me! If you touch it again, the gun won't help! Chester! Go away! Come on! Get out everyone! I never thought my life would turn out like this. Constantly seeing all this violence! .. Please, Mr. Bigelow, have a seat! Sit down! You told Marla that Raymond tried to kill you. When? Last time... about an hour ago. After I showed the photographer this picture. Why would he kill you? He stole uranium for resale. You all misunderstood. Let's start with the fact that I do not steal. I'm buying. Second, Raymond Taylor could not encroach on you an hour ago. - Why not? - Raymond was with my nephew. 685 01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:34,130 His body was fished out of the bay last night. I just got back from the morgue. Unfortunately, I don't know who did this to him. Are you sick, Mr. Bigelow? Is there something I can do? Not! Everything is fine! Dear nephew tried to fool me. I should have killed him for taking my... - But it's none of your business. - It's my business! Someone is trying to kill you. But it's way too unprofessional. He acts like... Why does he want to kill me? This is what I don't understand. You don't know anything. O! Now you know! Listen! I'm not interested in your business! I just want to know why they want to kill me! I'm afraid your time is up. Chester! Trust my word, I won't call the police! Practice does not confirm this. Besides, you now know too much. Now you know me. Who are you that I... for me to risk my life!? What would you do in my place? See, you can't answer. I'm really sorry! You guys go with him. No. Everyone doesn't have to go. Just him and me. Wait a minute! I'm sorry, Mr. Bigelow! Let's go! Marla! Get out! Immediately! You tried to put me down in front of Taylor. You didn't make it, right? I don't just like it... It amuses me. I only work for this. I'm not as cool as black people. But I'm not like you. I won't poke or... It amuses me! OK, try! Try! I love these attempts. Well, what are you? Go ahead! Courage was not enough! Hands are shaking? You are scared! Very scared! What if I shoot you in the stomach? You'll like it if it's in the stomach! It's been taking so long if you get it in the stomach. So slow... This is what will happen to you! So slow... Frank! What are you doing here? - Are you all right? - Yes! I wanted to see you. Paula, you have to go! You're in trouble, I know! - Yes, everything is in order! No problem! The police called from the Paradise Hotel. They asked where you might be. - Did you tell them? - Of course not! Frank, what's the matter? Let me help you! Everything is fine! I swear! Don't stay here, go away! Not! I will stay with you! Please, Paul! Trust me! It has something to do with Phillips... Or Reynolds? Phillips was killed. What does this have to do with you? You've only certified the paper. Yes... just certified the paper. One piece of paper out of a thousand others. Something terrible has happened. Frank, tell me! I'm afraid! Don't be afraid! Believe meyou have nothing to fear. Promise me this! Oh, I love you so much! I didn't even know that I love you so much! If I lose you, I will lose everything! Do not leave me! I feel like I'm losing you but I can't figure out why. Don't leave me, Frank, please! Give me a chance! Do you love me? Yes! I love! I have never been so sad in my life! 'Cause before I didn't understand what I have. But I know it now. You understand me? Yes, dear, I understand! I could have avoided all this. Sometimes something happens that changes everything. Sometimes it's a very small reason... ...or, conversely, important. But really I can accept what happened to me. After all, I love someone! I love you very much! I love you so Like I've never loved anyone in my entire life! - Let me help you! - You can't help me. Paul! I can't give you reasons but leave! New scarf? You look wonderful! Goodbye Paul! Excuse me, Miss Foster! You tried, but you did everything badly. - Reynolds! Miss Stevens said where is he? - George Reynolds is dead and you know it. Your buddy Stanley tried use me as a false target. - It's impossible! - Don't start it again! You are very good! You looked so shocked at the news that Philips was killed! Let's go find out what you did last night. Please listen! Stanley was with me all day. Ten minutes ago he called and said he was ill. He said his stomach was on fire! Good to see you dear! I feel terrible. - What do you need again? - Where is Mrs Phillips? She is in her room. She is not well. - Did you drink something? - Yes, I just drank. - Get out of here! - What exactly did you drink? -Go away! - What exactly did you drink? Halliday was pouring drinks. He came... and retired with my stepsister. in library. Caring... and I thought... unusually friendly. Halliday proposed a toast in remembrance about my brother. Then we drank. Miss Foster, turn off the lights! Call the hospital immediately call the emergency! In your stomach are now being digested particles of luminescent poison. Faster to the phone if you're going to save his life! Mrs Phillips! Oh Mr Bigelow! You're back? Johnny couldn't understand why are you roaming around. Halliday? His poison, Mr. Bigelow. Large dose of poison. His poison is in you, and in me, and in Stanley. Johnny is such an outstanding person! Outstanding? Very talented! He always got what he wanted. He wanted me... wanted to take the money... He persuaded my husband to conclude this uranium deal. Reynolds promised him ten percent. Did he kill Reynolds? He knew everything. That night he gave me fifty thousand dollarscase. I wanted to leave. But he knew that her husband had prepared another 60 thousand. Belated attempt... ...to pay damages... And he pushed your husband out the window. He did just that... He's smart... Johnny is so smart! Where is he? Tell me where is he? On a ship sailing to America. What time is the departure? After half an hour. I had to go with him. But he preferred Marla Stevens. Mr Bigelow! If you have time, be gentle with him. Johnny is such an outstanding person! I'm calling an ambulance. What for? To try to keep you alive. What for? Yes doctor! I called the hospital! I don't know what kind of poison it is. Marla, I'll go see the places. I want to see the chief. Yes? I want to report a murder. Where did it happen? At the Paradise Hotel. When? Last night. Who was killed? Me... Frank Bigelow. Tell that woman that we found it.
