- "Eyes like mirrors, pristine, "reflecting the reflection. "An endless game of self-deception. "Tears of shards of glass "cascading down silken skin. "Etching a deep, disfiguring trail. [Woman yelling] Not just without, but within." I'm trying to read, Ma! - Where's my insulin? - It's in the refrigerator! - I'm looking in the damn refrigerator! - I'm coming, Ma. [Sighing] Sarah Miles... I swear you're the only thing that keeps me sane. [Birds chirping] - Megan, sweetie, do you want milk or juice in your lunch? - I don't care. - Juice it is, then. [Phone chiming] Oh! Look at that. Mommy's new poem just got another like. - [Man]: Sarah! - I don't wanna go to school. - Sweetheart. - I wanna stay with you. - Sarah, did you see my phone? - You left it by the bed. - I know where I left it. What I wanna know is where it is now. I gotta go, I have a meeting in an hour and I can't be late. - Megan, honey, do you have your daddy's phone? - I was playing Friendly Fish on it. [Laughing] - Sweetheart, Daddy's gonna give you your own phone so you can play Friendly Fish anytime you want. Hmm? - Honey, why don't we make a little deal? You put a smile on your face for school, and when I come pick you up we can do something extra special. - Like what? - Well, we could go skiing on the other side of the mountain. - Can Daddy come? - Oh, sweetheart, I'd love to, but Daddy's gonna be working late tonight. - Again? - Betting on a new high-rise. Client likes to be entertained. - Ma? I got you a new book. - Just put it over there with the rest of them. - You should actually read this one. It's about... - Bah, I don't care what it's about. You spend too much time in them books. That's why you don't have any friends. - I have friends. - Who, the BronteÃ« sisters? What's that one you keep talking about? Writes all those stupid poems. - Sarah Miles. And they're not stupid. - Hm! Gimme a break. Total waste of time. What you need to do is get out there and find yourself a man. - Yeah, worked out great for you. - What d'you say? - Nothing, Ma. - Yeah. Well, stop your mumbling and bring me my dinner. - Yes, Ma. - Hm. - What are you still doing up? - Who is she this time? You're not gonna say anything? - What do you want me to say? - Yeah. I guess there's nothing to say. I can't do this anymore. - Do what? What can't you do? - This. Us. - You really have it tough here, huh? - I'm not talking about the house, or the money. I'm talking about our marriage. - I've had a long day. - Daniel, I'm leaving. - Don't be ridiculous. - I'm serious. I don't know what else to do. - You go, you go with nothing. - I told you I don't care about the money. - You go without Megan too. - I'm her mother. - Doesn't matter. No one takes anything from me. - She's not a thing. She's our daughter. - You know what I do, Sarah, and you know how I do it. I don't lose, ever. - Daniel-- - You try and take away my daughter, she'll grow up without a mother. Get out. - Lee! [Sighing] [Ma whimpering] - What happened? - Looks like I fell. Help me up. - What are you doing out here in the middle of the night, Mom? - I need sugar. - You're supposed to keep something to eat next to your bed. - I don't need a damn lecture. Help me up, dammit! - What would you do if I weren't here? - Where the hell else would you be? Don't stand there like an idiot. - I don't appreciate the way you're speaking to me. - Oh, you ungrateful little bitch. If it wasn't for me, you'd be out on the street. - If it wasn't for you, I'd have a life, Mom! - Poor little Lee, oh! Daddy's little girl-- - Don't! Don't call me that! [Banging on door] - Lee! Get out here right now! - Stop your whining and help me up! - Help yourself. - Where the hell you going, Lee? Help... me... [Ma yelling out] [rock music] - We're all set. I'll see you at 3. [Spoon clinking] - Shoulda been nicer to me. - ["Up from the cracked concrete, a single weed stretches toward the sun."] - Girl, I do not see what you see in that woman. - Are you kidding? Sarah Miles is a genius. - "Soft summer solace, drowning in an empty pool." She's so obvious. - You have no clue. - There's a reason she was published only once. - She has a blog now. - Ooh, a blog! I bet I have more followers on my Instagram. - Many brilliant female poets died before they became famous. Look at Emily Dickinson or Sylvia Plath-- - Well, unless she gets hit by a bus, I'm pretty sure the poetry of Sarah Miles is doomed to obscurity. [Phone ringing] - Hey, Daniel. - [Hey, I can't talk right now.] [I'm busy and I have to work late.] - Tonight? How late? - [I can't say. I have a meeting with the same clients.] - I get it. It's business. - [It's always business.] - Yeah. - [Hello?] - Hi, Mr. Nelson, it's Lee. - [Hi, Lee.] - I have an idea how we can bring in more customers, you know, people who love books. - [Yeah?] - I was thinking we could have authors come in and read their works, do book signings. - [You have someone in mind?] - Actually, yes, I do have someone in mind. - [OK!] [jazz music] [cell phone vibrating] - Hello? - Hi, Sarah. It's Will Lawrence calling. - I saw the caller ID, but I thought it must be a mistake. - It has been a long time. How you doing? - I'm well. - [Listen, the reason] I'm calling is because we have an offer for you. - Really? - [Don't get too excited.] [It's just for a reading.] - A reading? After all this time? - [Yeah.] It's at an independent bookstore [here downtown. There's no money in it] or anything, but the woman did seem very passionate about the idea, [and I told her I'd let you know.] - Thank you. - [I will text you her number. Her name's Lee.] Lee Maxson. - Oh, my God. She's really here. - Thank you. Hi. Uh, I'm Sarah Miles. - Lee. - I should've called first but-- - No! No, no, no. That's OK. I'm just so glad that you came. Um, can we get you anything, or do you want to take a seat? - Sure. I didn't know that there were still bookstores like this. - Oh, yeah. We're small, but we're really dedicated. - So... do you really think that anyone's gonna be interested to hear me read? - Of course. Of course they are. Your work really speaks to people. - Thank you, that's... that's really sweet of you to say. - Um, so we were hoping that you could come by as soon as Saturday, if that's OK with you. - Uh, I just have to figure out which pieces to read. - If I may... I think it would be so great if you did a mix of Silent Echoes with some of the poems from your blog. Vacant Lot is my absolute favorite. - Really? - Yeah. - That's my favorite too. - Oh! So, could we say 7 p.m.? - Yeah, sure, why not? - OK. [Giggling] [birds chirping] See, Mom, I have a friend now. A real friend. - Look, Daddy. - Ho, ho! It's beautiful, honey. I'm gonna frame it and hang it in my office. - Daniel, do you think you could watch Megan for a couple hours tomorrow, or should I ask Nina? - I can't think of anything I'd rather do. We got a date? - Yeah. - What are you gonna be doing? - Oh, I just have a couple of errands to run. - Good job. - "No more my savior, "no more your slave. "Forever a prisoner. My freedom, your grave." [Applause] Thank you. - Bye, Lee. Thanks. - Thank you. - See you later. - That was amazing. - Yeah, I think it went OK. - OK? Hearing those poems in your words, with your heart was... profound. [Chuckling] - Thank you. - That last piece, the newer one... I've never heard someone capture the desperation of an abusive relationship so perfectly. - What makes you think it's about that? - My father. He was like that. Cold and... controlling. All he... all he could do was hurt. [Screaming] - I'm sorry. - What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Is the piece about your father? - I actually never knew my father. Or my mother. Um, I was raised in foster care. - Oh. Then... your husband? - I actually promised Daniel that I would be home for dinner, so I should... - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to pry. - No, no, no. No, it's OK. I'm just really not used to sharing my work like this. - You know, I also write a poetry newsletter. It's no big deal, but I would love to interview you if you had time. - Let me think about it. - Yeah. Thank you again. Bye. - I'm home. - Mommy! - Hi, sweetie. - Mr. Maxson said something came up at work and he wouldn't make it home for dinner. - OK. Thanks, Nina. [Ominous music] I was so caught up in our perfect life that I didn't see what was happening. I've lost touch with family and friends... Everything that I do, everything that I am revolves around Daniel. - Has he ever been violent with you or your daughter? - Violent, no, but... he did threaten me. - Yeah, you mentioned that. - He works in construction, so he has connections. And if he knew that I was even here-- - I assure you that we will be quite discreet. - I don't want his money. I just want to be able to take my daughter far away from him. - Assuming you're right about his infidelity, once we gather evidence, you will have your divorce. But... with your husband's resources, you're likely gonna be looking at shared custody. Do you still wanna move forward? - I do. - I'm seeing Sarah later today. You would've loved her, Mom. She's so smart and beautiful and kind. It's like we're soulmates. - You have exquisite taste. - And many things. - Your wife is a lucky woman. - Who said they were for her? [Phone ringing] - [Yeah?] - Yeah, it's me. - [What's up?] - I think someone's following me. - [Where are you?] - Downtown. You need to find out what this is about. - OK, I'll put someone on it. - Well, when Silent Echoeswas published, it actually did really well. You know, for poetry. Um, I was invited to do readings across the country and, you know, I was pregnant with Megan, but it was early so I really wanted to go. Anyway, Daniel - that's my husband- sort of talked me out of it. And after that, things kind of cooled off. I wasn't writing as much and my publisher lost interest. - And what about your blog? - It's been my lifeline. I'm totally amazed at how much support I've gotten from my fans over the past couple of years. - That's because your work is amazing. - Thank you. You know, Lee, until I met you, I didn't realize how isolated I've become. - I hope you don't mind me saying, but... being married should never leave you feeling alone. I... anyway, um... I was actually an English major too. I had this big dream of moving to New York. - As a writer? - Oh God, no. No, I could never. I... I wanted to work in publishing. - What stopped you? - My... father died. He killed himself, actually. And my mom, uh... I just couldn't leave her alone. - You said that your mother passed recently? Maybe now is the time to follow your dreams. - Hey, uh... there's this library down the street and they're having their monthly book sale. I was gonna go check it out. Would you want to come with? - I've got some time. Yeah, sure, why not? I'm just gonna run to the restroom. - OK, yeah. - Excuse me? Was that Sarah Miles? The poet? - Why do you wanna know? - I'm a lit major. I'm one of her biggest fans. Like, she's up there with Sylvia Plath. I'd love to meet her. - Sarah is a very private person. - Yeah, no worries. Maybe just an autograph? - Maybe you could just get lost. - Take it easy, lady-- - Go! Get out of here now, or you'll wish you never met me. - Listen, I'm just interested in her work, that's it. - Don't touch me! This guy, he just grabbed me! - I did not! She's crazy! - That's right, little boy. Run away. - Sarah! You're really something. - You're gonna wake Megan. - Did you really think I wouldn't find out? - Find out what? - A divorce lawyer? - No. - Son of a bitch had a guy spying on me. - Daniel, please-- - Shut up! Shut your mouth, you lying bitch! Listen close, 'cause here's what you're gonna do. Tomorrow morning, you're gonna call Ms. McKinney and you're gonna tell her one of two things. Option A, you're gonna tell her you've had a change of heart, you're sorry, but your services are no longer required. Option B, you're gonna have her file for divorce, but you're gonna give up all custody rights to Megan, 100 %. - No, I can't do that. - [Hello?] - Ms. McKinney? - [Yes?] - Hi, it's Sarah Miles. - [Oh, hi, Sarah. I wasn't expecting to hear from you.] - Um... I've had a change of heart. [Construction sounds] [car chirping] - Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! I have a family! You don't have to do this! [Gunshot] [knocking on door] - Ms. Miles? - Yes? - Detective Collins. Your husband is Daniel Miles? - Yes. Why? - I'm very sorry to have to tell you: your husband is dead. - What? - It appears to have been a robbery. He was shot. His watch and wallet were taken We got his name from the car registration. - Daniel's dead? - Again, I'm sorry. Do you know what he was doing last night? - He said he was out with a client. - Do you know the client's name? - No. - Morning, Mommy. [Sniffling] - Good morning, sweetheart. Honey... last night, someone tried to steal your daddy's money and they hurt him. - Oh no... Is he OK? - He's not OK. He's, um... - Where's Daddy? - Sweetie, I'm so sorry, but your daddy's not gonna be coming home. - What do you mean? - He's gone, baby. I'm so sorry. Your daddy's gone. - No, you're lying! Daddy? - No, it's really-- - Daddy! Daddy! [Birds chirping] - Most of these people are Daniel's friends. I don't know what to say to them. - No one expects you to say anything. [Doorbell ringing] Let me get that. - No. No, no, I'll go. I can't stand still for too long. Lee! - Hey. I'm so sorry. I heard about Daniel on the news. I should've called, I didn't realize-- - Oh, no! Come in! - Are you sure? - Of course. - OK. - The victim was definitely screwing around on his wife. I talked to the girl he was with. She says it was their first time. I got the sense it wasn't his. - Any witnesses? - Couple people heard shots, nobody saw anything. - There have been a bunch of drug-related robbery homicides in that area just like this one. - Except for the car. - Car? - If it was a straight robbery, why didn't they take the car? The keys were right in his hand. - Maybe the guy panicked. - Maybe. - You're thinking what, jealous boyfriend or husband? - Maybe the guy's wife. Plus he owns a construction business. Could have ties to organized crime. - You know, Chris, sometimes a robbery is just a robbery. - I'm not feeling this is one of those times. - Lee, you don't have to do that. - It's the least I can do. - Megan asleep? - Finally. - How is she doing? - There aren't words. - Well, I'll see you tomorrow. - Thank you, Nina. I can't believe that he's gone. It's weird. I feel guilty. - Guilty? - It's not... like I'm happy that he's dead, it's just-- - I had to wait for my father to kill himself before I could start living my life. You can start living now. Really living. That's nothing to feel guilty about. - Because we are all God's children, and with that in mind, we can find peace. As the Lord has written: ashes to ashes, dust to dust. [Sermon continues indistinctly] - Here we are. - I'm not hungry. - Sweetheart, can you try to eat something, please? - That's Daddy's place! - I'm sorry, honey. - Megan. - It's OK. I understand. Hey, you know, my mom passed away just a little while ago, and every night when I come home from work, I still expect to see her there, waiting for me. - Do you miss her? - Of course I miss her. But I have to believe that she's in a much better place. - Heaven? - With all the angels. She asleep? - Finally. - Hey, uh, I got you a little something. - What's the occasion? - I don't know. Call it a thank-you gift. - Thank you for what? - For being my friend. - Oh, I love Byron and Keats! - I thought you might. It's a special edition. - Lee... This must have cost a lot. - Ma left me some money and I don't have anything else to spend it on, so... - Well, thank you... for the thank-you. - You're welcome. - Sarah, your work has really evolved. The complexity, the depth, the honesty... A few more pieces - the right pieces- and there's another book here. - You really think so? - I do. But if I'm gonna publish you again, I need to know that you're 100 % committed this time. - I have never been more clear about what I want. And I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen. - I can't wait for the book to come out. - Actually, would you mind taking a look at a few of my pieces in advance? - Really? I would be honored, yes. - You have to promise to be brutally honest. - Cross my heart. Hey... we should celebrate. Would you want to go for drinks Friday night? - I... I don't think that I'm up for a night on the town yet. - Well, at least you've embraced being single. - I don't know, Lee, I felt like... I've been living someone else's life, and now that life is gone. - You just need to start living your own now. It's gonna be so much better, I promise. "Searching, seeking, something amiss... "Wandering lost... A crystal mist." It's a beautiful piece. - But? - Well, you have this image down here, "Wandering lost", and a crystal mist, which is brilliant, but I just feel like, earlier... something's missing. - Hmm. I see. - I'm probably wrong. - No. No, no, you're absolutely right. I've been so worried, it's been hard to focus. Lee, I really appreciate your help. - I really appreciate you. - Mommy, come see what I made! - I'll be right back. - OK. - Sweetheart, that's beautiful! - Nina helped me. - Only a little. Your daughter's quite the artist. - Nina, you need a vacation. - What do you think? - I think it's perfect. - You're getting soft. - No, no, really. It is. Hey, uh... There's this jazz band that I love and they're playing Saturday night. I thought we could go. - I can't. - Sarah, you've been working so hard. - I know. It helps me keep my mind off... - I know. But... you need to blow off some steam. - Actually, I'm going to an event with my publisher that night. He said that there are some people that I have to meet. - Oh. - Trust me, it's the last thing I wanna be doing. - I'd watch out for him if I were you. - Will? - I've seen the way he looks at you. - He's... he's just a friend. - I'm gonna go make us some tea, yeah? [Dramatic music] - Mommy? Why did someone kill Daddy? - People do bad things for a lot of reasons. - Will the police get them? - I hope so. - Me too. [Phone chiming] - [This is Detective Collins. I need to speak to you.] [If you could come down to my office tomorrow, that would be great. Give me a call.] We did manage to find one witness. They were out walking their dog and noticed someone sitting in an older model sedan. When they heard shots, they looked out, saw the shooter run back to that same car and drive off. - So you... you're saying that someone was waiting for him? Waiting to kill him? - So it would appear. - Um... Well, I do know that he dealt with some unsavory characters in his business. - Can you give me some names? - No, Daniel always spared me the details. - You said you were at home the night your husband was killed. - Yes, with my daughter. - Ms. Miles, did you know about your husband's affairs? - I suspected. - Must have made you angry. - I'm sorry, you don't think that I-- - It's my job to consider every possibility. - This is crazy. I didn't kill my husband. I don't know who did. Look, if there's nothing else, I'd like to get home to my daughter. [Dramatic music] - To Sarah Miles, poet laureate. - Thanks. - I thought we were supposed to be celebrating. What's wrong? - The police... think that I killed Daniel. - That's ridiculous. - I don't know what to do. - OK, well, try to calm down. What did they say exactly? - Apparently, there was a witness to the shooting. - A witness? - Some neighbor. They saw someone waiting outside that girl's apartment, so now the police think that it was planned. - Did they say that they got a good look at this person's face? - No, no, but the cops know about Daniel's cheating, so... - Sarah, you didn't kill Daniel, did you? - No, of course not! - OK, so then they have no proof. You've got nothing to worry about. - What about the wife? - She says she was at home with her daughter. - You talk to the kid? - She was asleep at the time. - That's convenient. - Anyway, her car doesn't fit the description. - She could've hired someone. - Her husband controlled all the money. If she paid a hitman, she did it with loose change and coupons. - Or she made a deal. Cash on delivery. - She does have a lot of it now. [Loud retching] - Nina? - Megan, call 911! - Someone's chipper. - A little. - New man in your life? - No. - Woman? - Yeah. But not in the way you're thinking. - Too bad, because the way I'm thinking is pretty hot. - Hey, uh... have you ever had a friend and it's like they're a part of you? Like the part that's been missing or something? - None that I'm not sleeping with. - Can't you get your mind out of the gutter for one second? - Now why would I do that? - I got here as quick as I could. What happened? - They're not sure. Food poisoning maybe. - She was really sick. - Is she gonna be all right? - I hope so. They said she needs to rest for at least a week, maybe two. - If you need anything, anything at all, I'm here for you. - Thank you. - Yeah. - Actually, there is one thing. Good night, sweetheart. - Good night. - So, she's had her bath and her dinner, and you have my cell if you need anything. - Yes. Don't worry, we'll be fine. Won't we, munchkin? - Uh-huh. - Thank you again so much for helping me out. - Of course. [Doorbell ringing] - Hey. Wow! You look great. - Thanks. So do you. - Thanks. - What time will you be home? - We shouldn't be too late. - I'll call you. - OK. See you soon. [Dramatic music] - Sarah, the Millers just got here. Do you feel like joining the party? - Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. - Are you all right? - Yeah, uh... It's just, it's hard to engage in polite conversation with everything that's been going on lately. - You mean with your housekeeper. - And the fact that I'm being investigated for Daniel's murder. - What are you talking about? - Apparently, Daniel's cheating makes me a suspect. - OK, Sarah, you need a lawyer. - I have one. Colton Friedman? My divorce attorney referred me. - I know him. He's excellent. - I'm meeting with him on Monday. - Great. - [Hey!] - Hey. Is she asleep? - Like an angel. - I shouldn't be too much longer. - No, no, no. Your career's important. Take your time. - All right. If you need anything, text me. - I have everything I need. [Door opening] [dramatic music] Some more waffles, munchkin? - No, thanks. I'm full. - Me too. Thanks again, this was amazing. - Can I go play in my room? - Of course, sweetheart. Oh no, no, no, Lee. Leave them. - But it's no big deal. - No, please. You've done enough, really. - Are you sure? - Sit. - OK. Uh... Hey, you know, I was thinking... if the cops do decide to charge you with Daniel's murder, I can say I was with you that night. - I already told them that I was with Megan at home. - So say that you made a mistake, that you got confused. - I don't know. - Without an alibi, a jury's gonna think the worst. - Well, I appreciate the offer. Let's wait and see what happens. - Hi, can I please get the number for Solomon House Publishing? - From what I can gather so far the police have found nothing concrete. - That's because I'm innocent. - That doesn't preclude them from building a circumstantial case. Is there anything else that you haven't told me? Anything at all. - My husband, um... he hit me. - Do the police know? - No. I didn't tell them. It only happened once. - Does anybody else know? Your daughter? - No. No, no one. - All right. Let's keep it that way. And please, don't say anything more to the police without me. - Lee, what are you doing here? - I have good news. - You could've called. - This is "in person" news. - OK. - Solomon House is interested in you. - What? - They're the biggest publishers in the city. - I know who they are. How do they know about me? - I sent them some of your poems. - You shouldn't have. - It's the least I could do. - No, I mean you shouldn't have. Not without asking me first. I already have a publisher. - I know, but he's small-time. You deserve better. - Will knows me. He knows my work. - He's using you, just like Daniel. - Will is nothing like Daniel. He's my friend. - I'm your friend. I... I want what's best for you and for your career-- - Lee, look, I appreciate you trying to help, but I know what I'm doing. - You haven't published in seven years, Sarah! - I have to go pick up Megan soon. - I'm sorry, I shouldn't have said that. It's just, this is an amazing opportunity. Wait till you meet the woman from Solomon House-- - I'm not meeting anyone. Will has believed in me since the very beginning. He's earned my loyalty. - I'm sure you thought the same about Daniel. - Will you stop bringing up Daniel? Whatever his faults, he is dead now. - Yeah, he is. That's right, and he deserved it. - That is way out of line. - Sarah, I-- - I have to go. - Wait! [Doorbell ringing] - Who is it, Mom? - No one, sweetie. Eat your dinner. Lee's getting to be a bit much. - Yeah, sounds like it. Although... Solomon House is pretty impressive. - Don't worry, I'm not going anywhere. - I'm glad. [Cell phone vibrating] - She just keeps calling. - You know you can block her number, right? - Looks like I'll have to. [Phone ringing] - It's me again. We really need to talk. - Oh, come on! You can't just show up like this, Lee. - Sarah, please. - I'm serious. No more calls, no gifts. - You're upset, I understand. I went way too far, I can see that now. - Listen to me. - I just wanted to help. - You want to help? Give me some space, all right? - I would do anything for you! Don't you know that? Anything! - Then leave me alone! I'm being investigated for murder, for God's sake! - You don't have to worry about that. - What do you mean? - Just that... you're innocent. - How do you know? You don't even know me. - I do know you. I know that you're caring and kind, too kind to hurt anyone, even if someone deserved it. - You said that before. Daniel did not deserve to die. - He should've never laid a hand on you. - What did you just say? - I said he didn't deserve you. - How do you know that he hit me? - You told me. - No, I didn't. - Well, then I must have picked it up from your work. - I never wrote about it. It only happened once. Were you spying on me? - Of course not. Sarah, please-- - I have to go. Goodbye, Lee. [Dramatic music] - [You've reached Colton Friedman. Leave me a message] [and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.] [beep] - Hi, it's Sarah Miles. There's someone that you need to look into. - I hope you don't mind coming all the way down here, but I told Friedman I thought we should meet in person. - That's fine. - This Lee sounds like a real piece of work. - Yes, she is. - Now, she does own a late model sedan. Do you think she killed your husband? - I don't know, but... she's been stalking me and she seems unstable. [Dramatic music] - You told me before that you knew about your husband's infidelity. - I also told you that I didn't kill him. - Yes, but you neglected to mention that you were going to leave him. I subpoenaed your phone records. Jean McKinney is the best divorce lawyer in the city. - Any conversation my client may or may not have had with an attorney is privileged. - Would've been tough to get that divorce, what with the prenup. We found a copy in your husband's office. - We're done here. - What happened? McKinney couldn't get proof, so you opted for a more permanent solution? - No! - Don't say another word. - Or did your husband find out what you were up to and threaten you? Because if that's the case, you might be able to plead justifiable homicide. - I didn't kill Daniel. - Are you arresting her? - Not at the moment. - Didn't think so. Come on, let's get you home. - Hey. You need anything before I head home? - No, thank you. How are you feeling? - Good. Much better. - I'm really glad you're back. - Me too. Night, Megan. - Night, Nina. - OK, you. Bedtime. - When is Auntie Lee coming over? - I don't know. - Can she come tomorrow? - I don't think so, sweetheart. You know, she's been so busy lately that I have hardly seen her myself. - OK. Good night, Mommy. - Good night, sweetheart. [Dramatic music] [dramatic music] - Is this what you're looking for? You didn't think I'd know you'd show up here? [Car chirping] [dramatic music] [digging sounds] [car beeping] - I heard from Friedman. Crawford, the investigator? He's missing. - What happened? - Nobody knows. Apparently, he didn't come home last night and no one can reach him, not even his wife. - You don't think that it might be-- - All I know is that he was going to investigate Lee and now he's gone. - All right, you have to go to the police right now. - With what? I don't have any proof, not to mention they think that I killed Daniel. What I need is evidence. - If there is any. - There has to be. - Sarah, if you're right about Lee, then... there's no way you can be around her, it's way too dangerous. - The only thing that I have going in my favor is the way that she feels about me. If I play into that, maybe she'll let her guard down. - Yeah, and maybe you'll go missing. - There is no other way. Megan just lost her father and... I'm not about to let her grow up with her mother in prison. - OK. - [Hey.] - Hey. [It's me. Listen, I've been thinking.] I was wrong and you were right. - Really? - [Yeah, about everything.] If it's not too late, I would still like to meet with Solomon House. - [Yeah, that could be arranged.] - I'm really sorry, Lee. It's... it's been so long since I had a real friend. [What are you doing tonight?] - Just working until 6. - Let me make you dinner. To celebrate. - Yeah, I'd love that. - [Do you mind] if we do it at your place? Nina's gonna watch Megan. That way, you know, it'll just be the two of us. - Sounds perfect. - Yeah, it does. - Welcome. - Nice place. - Thanks. Come on in. Sarah, that was... amazing. - It's my pleasure. - Wait. Here's... to us always being there for each other, no matter what. To us. - To us. Why don't you go relax and I'll get dessert out? - OK. - Tada! - Oh, wow! You really went all out! - Like the song says, that's what friends are for. There's more if you want. - I'm good. I feel a little sick. - Too much wine? - I'll be right back. [Vomiting] - Lee? [Thud] Are you OK? Lee? [Dramatic music] [dramatic music] - [911, what's your emergency?] - Yeah, I need the police. My friend, she just... tried to kill me. [Sirens] - What? Oh no, no... - Step out of the car with your hands up! Let me see those hands! - What did I do? - Turn around! - I can explain that! - You can explain to the detectives. - Sorry you had to wait so long in holding. I was out all night on another crime scene. - I really can explain everything. - One sec. [Interview with Sarah Miles, January 24th.] [Ms. Miles, have you been advised of your Miranda rights?] - [I have.] - [And in the presence of your attorney,] [Colton Friedman, you agree to answer questions?] - [I do.] - For the record, against the advice of counsel. - I have nothing to hide. - Your friend, Lee Maxson, says you confessed to killing your husband. - That's a lie. - That 9mm automatic we found in your car is on its way to ballistics. - That's hers. That's Lee's. - How about you start from the beginning? - [Look, I know it sounds crazy,] [but it was Lee. Lee killed Daniel.] - Sounds crazy all right. - I don't know. - Don't tell me you believe her. - Well, the PI she hired, Paul Crawford, is missing. His car was found at a parking garage downtown. No prints. - You've got a jealous wife, who admits she knew about her husband's affairs--plural. If the ballistics come back positive, it's a slam dunk. - Why would she be so careful to use an unregistered gun, wipe it clean of prints, and then be so careless to drive around with all that evidence? - Ours is not to reason why. Let the DA deal with conspiracy theories. - Thank you for getting me out on bail. - Oh, we're just lucky the judge has a soft spot for kids. Thank Megan for that. You do understand you won't be able to leave your house until the trial. - Well, I have this to remind me. - She's saying I killed her husband? - She's rather adamant about it. - If there's anything I'm guilty of, it's not calling you when I first suspected what she'd done. - Why didn't you? - Well, what I told myself at the time was that she couldn't have done it. But now... - But now? - Deep down, I think I always knew. But I felt sorry for her. He hit her, you know. Did she tell you that? - No. - He hit her that night. - How do you know? - She told me. That's why I went right over there. After we talked for a while, she asked me if I could watch Megan so she could take a drive to clear her head. - A drive in your car? - Yeah, it was parked behind hers in the driveway. It was just easier for her, I guess. - Ms. Miles also accuses you of killing a private investigator she hired, Paul Crawford. - I don't even know who that is. Plus, uh, I hate guns. My father killed himself with one. - How does it work? - Well, if Mommy were to leave the house, the police would know where I went. - Why does the police think you're bad? - I told you, sweetheart, it's a mistake. - What kind of mistake? - I will explain it when you're older, OK? I promise. Now come on, it's time for bed. - Am I still gonna go to school? - Of course. Nina will take you. - What are you gonna do? - I'm gonna fix the mistake. [Dramatic music] - I thought you were my friend. - So, I got you some Colombian coffee, a couple good books that I know you haven't read yet, and a few treats from my favorite deli. - You're too good to me, Will. - I wish I could do more. - Maybe you can. According to my lawyer, it's going to be my word against Lee's. She presents herself as this delicate little flower, but she is as twisted as they come and I can't be the only one who sees that. - Friedman knows what he's talking about. - This is my life, Will. My daughter. I have to do something! - OK. It's gonna be OK. Where do you want to start? - [Uh, it rings a bell.] - Oh, so you did know Lee? - [No, but my dad was her twelfth grade teacher.] - Oh. I see. - [I'm sorry. It's all I have.] - OK, well, thank you. - [You're welcome.] - Thanks for talking to me. Your neighbors haven't exactly been forthcoming with me. - Well, this town is like its own little world and they like to keep it that way. Actually, I used to teach English over at the high school. Lee was one of my students. - What can you tell me about Lee? - Well, you know, Lee was... Lee was always very intelligent, you know, thoughtful-- soulful, actually, but quiet. She kept to herself and I always suspected from her behavior that there were problems at home. Could never get her to open up, though. It only got worse after her father killed himself. - Yeah, worse how? - Well, after the old man's funeral, she got into a screaming match with one of the other students. It got physical. The other girl ended up in the hospital. - You know what they were fighting about? - Don't know. They wouldn't say. Got suspended for a week, though. - Do you remember the other kid's name? - Yeah, sure, I remember them all. Maggie. Maggie Davis. Maggie Davis, yeah. [Dramatic music] - [Lee was unstable. We both were.] [I started seeing a shrink] [and things changed for me. I wanted the same for her.] - Maggie, Lee killed my husband. And we think that she killed another man, too. - [I begged her to get help,] [but she wouldn't.] [I should've told someone.] - Told someone what? - [Lee's father didn't kill himself.] [She did.] [But I don't blame her.] [After everything he did to her...] [but I can't forget that look in her eyes.] [It was like some kind] [of wild animal.] [I've never been so afraid of someone in my life.] [dramatic music] - Wanna take Caramel? - Hmm, he'll just stay with Mommy. - OK, that should do it. - I don't wanna go. - I know, sweetheart. It's only for one night. Mommy and Mr. Lawrence just have some things to figure out. - With the police? - With the police. Hey. Everything is gonna be OK, I promise. - Your mom's a very smart lady, Megan. - I know. - Who do you want to bring with you? - Hmm... Dolphinia. - That's a good choice. Come on, sweetie. - You're saying she murdered her father, made it look like suicide. - I'm not saying it. She did. Talk to her friend Maggie. - I will. I'll talk to the local cops too, but... - But what? - Even if she did kill her father, it doesn't change anything for you. Hell, it wouldn't even be admissible in court. - Look, um, Lee's the star witness, right? Couldn't you go to the DA and convince him to just hold off, take a look at the case? - I don't know. Maybe. [Dramatic music] - You know, we do have a guest room. - I like the sofa. Sometimes I even sleep on it at home. - I really appreciate you being here. - No problem. I just wish the circumstances could be different. - So do I. Good night. - Yeah, good night. [Thud and grunt] - Will? Will? Will? Will? - Not much of a boyfriend. - How did you get in here? - Daniel kept a spare key in his wallet. Don't you move. You stay right there. - What do you want? - I thought you were my friend. I thought you would always be my friend. I thought we were soulmates, Sarah. - Please... Put the gun down. Let's just talk. - So you can lie to me some more? - Lee, please-- - Shut up! Shut your mouth" After everything I've done for you! - You framed me for murder! - You gave me no choice! You rejected me! And you still didn't learn your lesson, digging into my past! - It's not just me. The police know too. - What do they know? - That you killed your father. - My father was a monster! But they couldn't prove that I killed him any more that they can prove I killed Daniel. - Lee... please... - I looked up to you, Sarah. Your words spoke to me unlike anyone else's. But in the end, that's all they were. Empty, hollow, meaningless words! - Lee... if you kill me-- - I'm not gonna kill you, Sarah. You're gonna kill yourself. Get on your blog! - Lee, please-- - Do it now! Keep it short and sweet. - What? - Your suicide note. Or should I say poem, only seems thin, don't you think? - Lee! Lee, think about this! - Oh, I have thought about it. It's actually all I've been thinking about, Sarah! - What about Will? No one's gonna believe that I did that to him. - Well, you don't have to worry about Will, 'cause I know how to make someone disappear. - Please don't do this. - Get busy. And make it good. This'll be the last poem you ever write. - Please, Lee... Megan needs me. - I needed you! I needed you and you turned your back on me! But maybe she'll be my friend. - No, you can't. You can't. She's not even here. - I know. She's with Nina. - Please, Lee. Please don't. - Well, I need something to remember you by. - She is just a little girl. She does not deserve this. - We don't always get what we deserve. But you're going to, so start writing! - OK, OK! [Typing] "A rudderless ship, adrift "at sea... "Suffering the night... Alone, but free." [Moaning] [gunshots] [door opening] [dramatic music] - [911, what's your emergency?] - Uh, yeah, I need an ambulance to my home. - [I'm sending paramedics as we speak.] [Give me your address and the nearest cross street.] [phone ringing] - Collins. - [Sarah Miles just left her house.] - You got her on GPS? - [Roger that.] - Call Nina. - [Car]: Calling Nina. [Soft music playing] [phone buzzing] - Nina, if you get this, take Megan and get out of there! [Knocking] [music stops] - Hi. - What are you doing here? - Uh, Sarah told me to come and pick up Megan. - She didn't tell me. - Well, I'm telling you now, so... - I have to call her. - Hey. Hey there, sleepy head. - Auntie Lee? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - It's OK, come with me, OK? Come on. It's gonna be fine. Come on. - Where are we going? - Everything's gonna be fine. - Mommy! - Let her go! - Stay back! - It's OK, sweetie, I'm here. Lee! Please, Lee... This is over. - I want Mommy! - Your mommy was the best friend I ever had. My only friend, really. She was the only thing keeping me from... - Lee! - Put the gun down right now! Slide it over here! Put it down! Put it down right now! [Sirens approaching] - Lee, listen. Listen to me. - How could you do this to me? - What's wrong with Auntie Lee? - She's OK. She's gonna be OK. She just needs to get some help. - Help? Help? Who's gonna help me? You? I trusted you, Sarah! I did things for you that nobody else would've done! I gave you your life back! I believed you when you said that we were friends! - We were! - No! I thought you cared about me, but you don't. [Sirens approaching] You don't. Nobody does. Nobody ever did. - Lee... please... - Take care of her. [Gunshot, Megan screaming] - I've got you. I've got you. [Sirens] - I just wanted to thank everybody for being here tonight to help us celebrate the release of Sarah Miles' new collection of poetry, entitled After. Sarah has graciously agreed to read a couple of her favorite pieces for us. Sarah? [Cheers and applause] - Thank you, Will. These past few months have been difficult, and I don't know where I would be if it wasn't for Will. He's been such a good friend. I would also like to thank my daughter, Megan. This book is dedicated to her. The first piece that I'm going to be reading is titled Uncharted. "Alone in the void you left behind, "no refuge from the storm of time. "A rudderless ship, adrift at sea, suffering the night. "Alone, but free. "No stars to guide, no wind to flee. "Just the promise of dawn, for her and for me." Closed Captioning by SETTE inc.
