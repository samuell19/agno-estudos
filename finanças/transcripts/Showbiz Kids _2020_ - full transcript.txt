And the life of a child was not my life. ♪ ♪ As of 1920, I started to work. I was born in 1918, so I went to work at two. I didn't realize it was so special. I thought every parent had worked as a child for their parents. I had put that together. It was a piece of cake as far as a director was concerned. Anything they told me to do, I did, you know, without any fuss. My three big feature films were very successful. So I went on with my career for quite a while. We had employees, we had a chauffeur, and we had maids, and we had a cook, and this was because we couldn't function as a star without those accoutrements, you know? They even had a doll made for me. They featured me as the million-dollar child star. Every film was gonna be a million dollars. But my father discovered that he would not be cut into the profits, so my father got furious. So, he quit. He broke the contract. And my career was over at seven. Hi. My name is Marc Slater, and I'm reading for the role of Proud Peacock.

You have the-- the stage moms, you know, and I don't ever wanna be one of those, because you see them, and they have told me that I was a bad mother because I let him go to karate. - Ah! - I let him spar. Okay, they said, "This is the moneymaker." - "Moneymaker! Moneymaker!" - Don't let-- Well, I mean-- and I, you know, I'm horrified. I'll... be... right... here. Acting scared the hell out of me. Like, I-- I pissed my pants first time I was on stage. Like, just outright. And then, as I was sitting in the wings, waiting for my pants to dry, I thought... "It's not so bad. I don't think I'll do that again." I grew up in south Texas, sort of in a rural community. Being an actor wasn't really on the radar. Like, there weren't a lot of guys going off to Hollywood, like, in my neighborhood. The only kind of show business was, like, rodeo show business. My piano teacher was the musical director for the local theater. She got me involved in acting, and I thought it was great because it took me out of piano lessons. I thought, like, I could do this. I could do this acting thing. Mama, did our daddy love us? I mean, I was-- I was acting and I was reading lines and doing all of that, but I still didn't really have an idea of what I was doing.

I'm like, Oh, should I... should-- you know? Didn't anyone ever teach you to knock? I did knock. You did not hear it. After this, knock harder. I hated it, to be honest. I hated working. I hated going on set. You know, I was-- I was 11 years old. I was really a little girl that wanted to play with dolls. Well, I always wanted to be in show business since I was kid.

My Saturdays and my after school were full of learning different skill sets for the arts. My mom wanted to be an actor, and wanted to be a model. - And the way she tells it... - Jesus!

Even though I was working, I still got to do all that. It kind of-- I was able to be a regular child than most other actors were not able to do that, but I was able to be a regular child. Most child actors don't get a chance to be regular children. I had that chance to be that. There was this sort of snobbery in our family about acting and about the right way to go about it and the right way to present yourself in that we weren't gonna be the cutesy, like, child stars. We were serious. You know, this was-- We were gonna do this right. It was about doing great work, working with great people, and like... We were kinda snobs. I came from a family of artists.

Maybe it's more of a girl thing, I don't know, but, like, that stuff was much more traumatizing than filming for me. I didn't wanna be in dresses. I didn't wanna be in heels. I didn't-- I was a tomboy, and that stuff was really forced onto me, and it's forced onto a lot of girls, and we're starting to reject it now. You're seeing it more. But, like, I also know that so many people have been pressured into staying into the closet and conforming to certain gender norms that are really prevalent in the film industry. How old were you when you were picked for this picture - by Mr. Kubrick? - I was 14. Did you know what the story was about? - Yes, I did. My mother had read the book, and we discussed the story, and she knew of their previous work. She knew that Mr. Harris and Mr. Kubrick do very artful pictures, and that they are not a quickie film company. She had quite a bit of faith in them. How old are you? Jodie Foster loves her life. Even though she has worked since she was three, she doesn't feel she has missed anything. On the contrary... I missed all the bad things, really. I missed all the pimples and insecurities, and, "Oh, what am I gonna do? He doesn't like me?" You know, I missed-- I missed all the bad things about growing up, really. ♪ ♪ Do you see yourself as a... a 12-year-old girl, an actress, a model, an adult, a kid? - What do you see-- - I see myself as a 12-year-old kid. But that just has maybe more privileges and has experienced more than another 12-year-old kid. ♪ ♪ Leon... think I'm kind of falling in love with you. It's the first time for me, you know? I just knew that that movie was nothing without the casting of Mathilda being perfect. I don't think the director, Luc Besson, fully understood that at first, how big a challenge it was gonna be to find parents that would let their 11-year-old daughter play this part. Hi, Mathilda. Hi, piggy. - How you doin'? - I've seen better days, but I've seen worse also. Speak up, I can't hear you. It's a belly button ring! How else can I say it? I don't speak no other languages! Oh, and you wanna know what that is? That is a tongue ring. It's that dichotomy with art, of, well, teenagers do have a sexuality, and there's a part of me that believes we should explore that in a way that makes them feel less crazy and more in tune with themselves, and also sometimes, if it's done right, it can be a really beautiful exploration of innocence and coming-of-age. You need them to be sexual, but you also need them to not be sexual. Um, you need to push the boundaries while not pushing any boundaries. And you're navigating this super adult world, which is just kind of being dangled in front of your face while being told to stay a kid. It's like, that's-- that option is gone already. Kids talk about sex all the time, but... truthfully, I still think it's kinda gross. I also, like, knew about my sexuality when I was about 12. Um, I'm bisexual. Uh, and that was really interesting to navigate as well. When I started doing better in the industry, yeah, and I was sort of prepubescent, and you're put in these situations, a lot of them are your first experiences, and they're, like, on camera. You're put into an environment with a lot of adults. You end up becoming very friendly with a lot of adults, and, you know, your mom can't always be there. And, of course, especially in your teenage years where you're also pushing your boundaries. "Am I a girl? Am I a woman yet? "I wanna be a woman, but, like, you know, my mom won't let me" kind of thing. I mean, I got myself into some messes with-- with guys for sure, older guys. I mean, when I think now, like, what were they doing with me? I'm like, jeez, what, you know, schmucks and what creeps, you know, but at the time, I just thought, you know, because I'm so special and I'm so mature and this and that. And I guess I was, you know!

Thank you for signing! - Thank you! - Thank you so much! Okay, thanks. After "E.T." and two weeks in the theater, it was kind of a sensation for a few months. "E.T." is a phenomenon, the biggest thing ever to hit the cinema. That seemed like forever as a kid. I was in San Antonio, Texas, and people were like, "Oh my God! It's the kid from 'E.T.'!" And I wasn't set up for that at 10 or 11. The best way I can describe it is for a long time, to me, being recognized felt like the way it does when you're in a restaurant and they sing to you on your birthday. Just that, like, "Oh God. This is nice, but I don't feel comfortable with this," and "Oh, in front of everybody and everybody's gonna know. It's nice, but, oh, okay." That's-- that's kind of how I felt about being recognized. Hi, I'm Wil Wheaton, and... My experience switched. I stopped being a kid who was an actor, and I became a child star. And that fundamentally changed my life. ♪ ♪ I was all of a sudden getting letters from people from all over the country. Those of you who write hate letters, please spell correctly. I was recognized when I went places for my work. All of a sudden, these expectations for me. People wanted me to talk about stuff that I knew nothing about. Wil Wheaton! You're our guy. Come on. I turned into, like, a teen magazine teeny bopper idol kid. I hated all of that stuff. I didn't like it at all. It was way outside of my comfort zone. It was not what I wanted to do. Am I famous? I don't think-- Am I famous? It created this reality for me where I kind of had to play the role of the young celebrity. The adults in my life who should've been protecting me from that were like, "This is the dream!" And, like, kept pushing me in front of them and pushing me into these places where-- where I didn't feel safe, and I felt really afraid. You shouldn't have to deal with, you know, all the responsibilities and all of the eyeballs when you're that young. Everybody has an idea of what they want you to be, and, at that age, you don't even know what the hell you wanna be. It's fucked up to think about, you know, your entire adolescent life is documented for the entire world to see. That's crazy to think about. That's when you go through your awkward phase. That's when you go through, "What am I? I don't know what I want in this world," and everyone's watching you. Everyone has something to say. Everyone has an opinion about what you should be doing, what you shouldn't be doing. People would just not tell the truth. Just say whatever they wanna say, and they're believed by, you know, whoever their followers are. When you get a like on social media, you get a little hit in your brain, and it becomes this self-perpetuating, self-reinforcing thing. But, what are we doing? You're blogging for, like, the YouTube channel. It's like the Smith family vacation. But it's not a vacation 'cause we're working. Just dealing with the pressures of social media alone.

And you don't know what to do anymore. And that's how you end up on a shitty reality show because you're like, "Please, just somebody pay attention to me, 'cause that's the only way I know how to exist." Ooh! Can I get my face painted? How about we wait till the line's a little shorter? We'll come back. We are professionals. Manny? Manny! We are, probably, a little moe mature than the average kid. Uh, socially, we probably have more skills. But, we still don't know jack shit about the world. I understand that you see me in a certain way. People put you on a pedestal. People think you're really smart and, you know, "Oh my God. You're so clever and witty and," blah blah blah, whatever. But that's just because you're a child actor. They don't actually know you. You might recognize Mara, by the way, from-- Barbara, can we swap over here? Just swap Mom. No, come in! - Scooch. Just scooch right over. - Scooch over. But, uh, you may recognize Mara - from "Mrs. Doubtfire," and... - Yes! It felt very out of control to have everybody know my name, and I didn't feel like I could trust anybody. And that's still a problem that I have now sometimes is because I-I don't know when people want me because they think I have connections, or they-- they, you know, like me because of an image that they have of me as a child. Evan, how did it feel to get nominated for a Young Star Award? It's wonderful. I was nominated last year, and I had such a fun time, so I'm really looking forward to going again. Yeah. The better I did, the more I felt like who I was wasn't acceptable. And I don't think that anybody did that on purpose, but suddenly, I felt like I didn't belong to myself anymore. I was a commodity that needed to be monitored and groomed and I had to look a certain way and present myself a certain way. And then bring your hand up-- There you go. Excellent. My voice just kept getting quieter and quieter. After a while, you don't really know, like, do you wanna be my friend 'cause you wanna be my friend, or do you wanna be my friend because I'm on TV? And, you know, that's-- you gotta figure that out for yourself, and at 13, how do you... you don't have the social skills yet to sniff out a social climber or a person who's trying to use you. And I got used. All of a sudden, all of my cousins who've either ignored me or tormented me, are treating me like I'm a big deal. And I knew that it wasn't because of me. I knew that it was because of the movie. And I remember kind of resenting that and feeling like, you know, I imagine like it would've been better to be like, "Yay, they finally care that I exist," but I remember feeling like... like, this is all bullshit! Like, this isn't about me. This is because I'm famous. And that was the beginning of not being able to trust anybody. Professionally, it made me, like, the It Kid that every casting director wanted to get a Henry Thomas-type for the next role. Help, police, murder. I remember I was getting scripts with straight offers, and we had to listen to an agent. - It was just a strange time. - Action.

So at 10, I retired, having made for my family, between films and vaudeville, two million that I'm sure of, and another million that I'm not quite certain of. Jackie Coogan was a victim of being exploited. His family had exploited him terrifically. He endures everything. I had... innumerable outside interests, uh, endorsements of, uh, of product and food and clothing. So that I was earning about a million dollars a year, all told. Coogan had success as a child star, and he ran a full course. But he was destitute. He died broke. ♪ ♪ I had money, but not the money I should've had. My dad didn't tell us something he should've told us. That these people were ripping off his clients. My dad didn't tell us for three years, and they got most of my stuff, too, so... And, you know, the unfortunate part, when they come to get you, they come in a little... They don't come by themselves. They come in a little minivan full of people, and everyone's doing something different, working a different angle. And it's all to get your money out of your pocket. That's what it's all about. The money that I earn from movies goes into a savings account, but I get my allowance. But what people don't realize, no matter how little or how much money that the child makes, that it is the child's money. It's not our money. I think I felt an enormous pressure on myself, like, to... sort of stay at home and-- and make that peaceful and have a degree of normalcy and... But, there was an ongoing existential "now what" with the family. My mom was there with me all the time. My dad was still working and... she basically came with me for the next four years, five years on all of my films, until I was 17. I think she, uh, she resented me for that for years afterwards, but... you know, when you're a kid, you don't really think about what everybody else has to do to accommodate your-- your burgeoning film career. We try to keep him, you know, halfway normal. He just wants to be regular. She was coming at it from a place of... ignorance, of... "I don't know this world, and it's scary to me, "and I feel like people are trying to rip us off, and, possibly, hurt us." So, that was her front and that was her attitude, and... I don't think it necessarily, like, did me a lot of favors, career-wise, because I think she was labeled as difficult to work with, and, consequently, I was labeled as difficult to work with. Wait, what? - Yay! Yeah. - A callback. - But, when is it? - Next week. You have to prepare the sides with a Southern accent and... "if the music director asks please be prepared to riff on the songs." Okay. Everything revolves around her right now, so, like, I don't work because I follow her around all day and bring her to auditions, and she needs to be on set. You know, I have to be there, so we've all kind of sacrificed a lot so she could do what she loves. So, I hope she knows that, but. Morning, Dad. You know, people have to sacrifice for you, which I didn't understand as a kid, but then, sort of looking back on it now, I go, wow, you know, my dad quit his job. My son is irritated with me 'cause I'm documenting this. - Why? - But I'm documenting this - because I can! - Great. My mom was letting me skip, you know, my last period in school so I could go to some stupid audition that I didn't book. And when it really hit home for me was when my sister would come home from school, and talk about how her classmates would just naturally associate her with me, and that's what she was. I hated that, and that killed me. I didn't want her to feel like she was in my shadow, or that she was lesser than. So, there are definitely things that, like, you think back on, and you're like that changed the entire fabric of, you know, my family and the way that we work as a unit. I think with, especially with my mother, she clung to me during that time 'cause she wanted to be very protective. I can't help but think that I'm sure people in my family felt like she started disappearing with me when my career started taking off. I think it just happens, and I think we all felt it. And I think I felt a lot of guilt for it that I never really... vocalized or knew how to process. And then, very quickly, felt like... whatever struggles I was going through, or whatever... I couldn't talk about because I was where... I felt like a lot of people in my family wanted to be, and so I think I... I silenced my voice pretty quick, and just felt like, well, I can't-- I don't-- I can't complain about anything anymore. Mara clearly has a grip on playing a dramatic role, but nothing in her training could've prepared her for what happened in the midde of our "E.T." interview when she lost a tooth. Yes. Oh no. My mother died during the post-production process of "Matilda." I felt kind of lost and unmoored without her, and just kinda kept acting in movies because it felt like a constant in my life. The entertainment industry is gonna make a decision about me. Am I a serious actor who's going to follow a track that leads to serious work and serious roles? Am I an accident that got lucky in one movie? My parents put me in a shitty horror movie... But here, nothing is what it seems. Because they threw a bunch of money at us and dangled a trip to Rome for the family. Wil Wheaton of "Stand By Me" must stand alone... against "The Curse." At the time, my mother was being my manager. In my life circumstance, her being my manager was all about her needs and not about what was best for me. I went and worked in a phenomenally abusive environment and had a terrible experience, and I think it really hurt my film career. Our next movie is "Return to the Blue Lagoon." It is easily one of the most ridiculous movies I have ever seen in a long career of many ridiculous movies. I felt so horrible, um, after reading you know, bad review after bad review after bad review, and it screws you up. I mean, you're just becoming a teenager, and this is, like, your first understanding of where your place is in the world, how people view you, and that really put a bad taste in my mouth for acting, and that really convinced me that this wasn't what I was meant to do. Like, my mother was an amazing actress, but... I needed to find myself. Very quiet, please. We're rolling. You're in this environment of... - Speed. - ...a circus. - Action. Where everybody's part of the circus, and everybody understands, and everybody's there to accommodate you because you're all in the same world. You're working together to do something. And then you leave that, and you go back to, in my case, rural Texas, where mostly no one has been on a film set, and... you start to get this feeling like, "Oh, well I don't belong here. "I belong there in the circus world. "So, everything that fails here, "I'm just gonna take this back to the circus, "and the circus people, they'll be cool to me." Let's hug. Let's all hug and pretend like we like each other. My mom really felt like she was doing the right thing most of the time. Um... but I think where everyone failed, moms, managers, lawyers, everybody, um, no one ever asked me how I was doing. Um, my emotional state was equated with how well I was doing... you know, in my career. And so, the better I did in my career, the more they just assumed I was fine. No one really checked in, especially as things began to ramp up, and the fame came in. No one asked, "How are you?" You know? Just a simple question. The amount of pressure that young entertainers have to have it all together and to not be allowed to actually be young. The kind of detriment that I see that it has on the psychology of young adults. It's a lot of pressure. One thing that Jaden and Willow don't necessarily, they don't have to figure it all out. So, there's some pitfalls that we can see and go, "No, no, not that." - We really are proud of Willow. - Yes. Money, fame, glamour, I have seen people lose sight of that. Even Will and I have slipped into that. You know, we had to catch ourselves, and Willow's like, "I'm not doing 'Whip My Hair' anymore!" It's like, okay, we get it! ♪ I whip my hair back and forth ♪ ♪ I whip my hair back and forth ♪ After that whole "Whip My Hair" thing, I was just, like, plunged into this, like, black hole. - Mm-hmm. - And I was, like, cutting myself-- What? I've seen a lot of beautiful young people and children... You know, I've seen them... Yeah, I've seen them... just be destroyed. ♪ ♪ My parents were always telling me, you have to be happy and smiley when we're meeting people. You have to be glad to meet people and you have to be nice to your fans, and it could be hard for me sometimes. I struggled with it because sometimes I just wanted to hang out with my friends. I didn't really want to you know, be signing autographs and doing all these things. I felt kind of uncomfortable with it. I had some kind of impostor syndrome. But, I started picking up on things, and it happened from a young age. I noticed, like, much older men being interested in me and knowing my name, which felt wrong to me. I remember Googling my own name, which was a terrible thing, and I saw people, like, talking about Photoshopped child porn for me. It was hard for me sometimes to talk to my parents and my family about this, because I felt like I was a burden on them. I felt ashamed. My parents tried to protect me from these dangers, but I could sense them. I could feel them, and I knew that there were times when they just weren't going to be able to protect me. Maybe it would be best if you didn't even mention you know, that you came back here and I gave you all this ice cream before dinner. Why don't we just make it our little secret, huh? You know something, Mr. Horton? You're sneaky. The thing about that issue when you're young is you're not able to talk about it. That's the biggest problem. The person wants to keep it a secret, but then you feel ashamed of yourself, so then you keep it a secret. Well, I was 12 years old, and my publicist, he... basically, got-- talked me into doing things that I didn't really wanna do. I was-- hadn't had sex before, and he kinda convinced me that this was the right thing to do, and kinda told me, like, "Don't tell your parents," you know, and he bought me a bicycle. He always kept doing things for me that I didn't quite really understand. - So he kinda seduced you? - It started at 11-- Yeah, he seduced me, and it started at 11 years old to 12. You know, when I first came out and told my mom about it, my mom knew I was telling the truth. She could look in my eyes and knew I was telling the truth. My dad took his side, and that was the bad thing. My dad-- It kinda crushed-- When my dad took his side, that crushed me. It ruined me, actually, because then I was on a self-destruction course to destroy myself just to hurt him. It's something that a lot of parents need to see and understand that these people are right there, ready to trick you, you know, and not trick you out of your money. Trick you away from your kid, and that's a bad thing. In my experience, I know a lot of, um, kids that grew up in the industry, and what surprised me when I got older was finding out that pretty much all of the young men were abused in some way, sexually. I was at the Golden Globes. I watched a pedophile win. I knew. Not a lot of people know, but I know that he's molested boys in the industry. And I watched him get up and accept an award, and I walked out and just started sobbing. And a bunch of people ran after me, and they said, "What? What? What's wrong?" And I just was like, "I don't know if I can do this anymore. "I can't keep watching this happen. I don't know how to handle this. This has to stop." After years of claiming sexual abuse, '80s star Corey Feldman is finally being heard by the LAPD. I can tell you that the number one problem in Hollywood was, and is and always will be, pedophilia. This morning, Kevin Spacey in a drama of his own. The "House of Cards" star under fire following allegations of sexual misconduct. At least six men accused Bryan Singer of sexual misconduct spanning two decades. Any industry that has that muh power and is that competitive, because after a while, it starts to become "Well, who can take the most abuse?" Because somebody's waiting in line to take your place, so you just start to allow yourself to be abused in some form or another. Um, every actor is guilty of that. They're lying if they say they're not. - For sure. Because it's just part of the deal at this point, and, unfortunately, until things change, there's always gonna be somebody willing to - take abuse. - And stay quiet. And stay quiet. Yep. Yep. Yep. - It happened to me, too. - Me, too. It happened to me, too. People are coming out, women are coming out and talking about things that they've experienced so that young women, and young boys, who are coming up in the game can have more awareness that it's not just a saying. It's actually -- It is actually a reality. I put a GizmoWatch on him when I go-- so he can call me. I mean, if anything happens, I was like, you call me. I mean, you hit one button, I'm in that door. I don't care! Okay, I can do my... I'm-- I'm realistic of what really goes on, or can go on. I didn't think that back-- I mean, about children back then. Now, you know, the-- always the MeToo thing. That-- I had some instances like that that I had to say "absolutely not." I'm grateful that Willow may not have to come up against that as well because it's so-- people are like... people are talking. You know? "Shining Time"? What does that mean? Do you want me to get off here? I had been burned out on acting for a while, but... Hollywood wasn't really interested in me anymore either because I was pubescent and deeply insecure, and I was not a cute teenager. I'd been a cute kid, and I hadn't even realized that I'd been a cute kid. In fact, I didn't like being told that I was a cute kid because I thought it was condescending. I would self-sabotage on auditions all the time. Just didn't wanna go to them. I felt so desperately insecure. I would look at all the other girls around me, which was something that I'd never done before. ♪ ♪ I had never felt particularly great at auditions. But now, I was... 16, and I was going into rooms where they were expecting like, an 11-year-old boy to walk through sometimes. And I remember being at several, uh... meetings and sitting in the green room, waiting, um, and seeing, like, a producer walk out, and kind of try to casually, like... take a look, and go back, and then I'd see another producer come out, take a look, go back, and then be five minutes of silence. And then a receptionist would come and say, "I'm sorry. "You know, they're not gonna see you today. We're-- we rescheduled it." Blah blah blah. And I-I realized quickly, I was like, "Oh. "They-- they're not looking for teenage me. They're looking for, like, 'E.T.' me." It's almost as though you had ceased to be alive. I had the feeling that I was a senior citizen at 15. And it not only happened to m. It happened to so many of the children. They were adorable, they were wanted, they were loved one day. And almost the very next day, just when they were becoming human beings, in a sense, full adult human beings, they were told, "You're finished." - Congratulations. "Jessie" is nominated. - Yes. That is amazing, and you guys just wrapped up. - So, how was that, like, on set? How was that? - Yeah. It was sad. It was really sad. It was really hard saying goodbye, but at the same time, we're all moving on to bigger and better things, hopefully. So, it should be good for all of us, and, uh, it was really sad though because I-- we basically grew up on that stage. I think I started to sort of question everything. When people would go, "Are you gonna go to college?" I was like, oh shit. Um, no? I don't know. I've-- Like, should I? Right? I'm, like, confused, and people are... 'Cause that's-- But that's society's plan, right? My life was do two jobs at once. I'm doing school and I'm working. - Down, up! And now, you know, do I do college? I don't know. Like, why-- why would I? 'Cause I've made money, but also that-- that would be good for me, and I don't know anything about money, and holy shit. Then it's just, like, a spiral of you know, okay, what-- Stop. What it is... What-- what is it that I need to do to prepare myself for the real world because I wasn't living in it. This is not real. I really got turned off to the business. I mean, when I was 16, "A," I moved out of my house. Listen, I was emancipated. My mom emancipated me so I could work adult hours. You can't say anything about what I do. I have my own money. I'm gonna move out. I went and got married. I, like, full on... just kind of went crazy. And I understand right now you're kind of in a tough time. You actually don't have a place to stay right now, is that true? - No... - So you have no place to live. Where's all your stuff right now? It's at JFK. In storage. - Really? It's in storage at JFK? - Yeah. I've got about... - 15 boxes. - What's in the boxes? Um, well, candlesticks, - books, uh, picture frames, you know, stuff. - Right. - So you just pick-- - A lot of Carltons. - No. - A lot of cigarettes... I did feel like I had kind of a bad start in this industry, and I knew that I wanted to be an artist. Um, I knew I had a voice and I had something to say. After I turned 18, and there were no signs of anything slowing down, and I had done the film "Thirteen" when I was 14, right on the verge of becoming a woman, and I was-- all eyes were on me, and at that point, there was a tremendous amount of pressure of what I needed to be in order to be successful. And a lot of it went against who I really was, and who I felt I really was. Right, stay there. Just, uh... When I hit my early 20s, I just realized, "Oh, I have no life skills." I know how to be a really successful actor and do really great work, and that's about it. And it all kinda came crashing down on me at once, and I short-circuited. And I also was left with the question of, "Is this even really who I am and what I wanna do?" And what happens if I walk away? Born after the original series went off the air, Wil Wheaton, the youngest member of the cast of "Star Trek: The Next Generation," considers himself, without a doubt, to be a fan. The people from "Star Trek" reach out to my agent, and she sent me on the audition, and I booked the job. Sir, I know this may finish me as an acting ensign, - but-- - Shut up, Wesley! Everything that I have said would've been listened to if it came from an adult officer. Generally, young men were furious that there was another young man on their science fiction television show. A hundred million words have been written about that. I don't need to go over it again. It was like being told this thing that you spend all day, every day, working on instead of being kid, it doesn't matter, and we hate you for it. And then, I turned 18. I was an adult. I could make my own decisions. And I had this revelation. "Oh, I don't have to do this if I don't want to." I don't have to do this thing that means more to my mom than it does to me. I can go live my life. I can be my own person, - and I just kinda walked away. - There. What do you think of that, huh? I think your mom is gonna kill you. My mom? She hasn't been in here since I was six. I understand why young people who aren't ready for it, and I really don't know of a young kid who is ready for it, get resentful and get self-destructive, and-- and, like, start engaging in dangerous behavior because they feel so out of control. - I'm looking for a job. - Hey, man, everybody's coming in here asking me for a job. What am I supposed to do? The transition for most kids when you transition from that is you have to transition into adulthood and hope that you continue to work, but, for me, I could've made that transition very well, but I made it more difficult on me than it should've been. When did it start to-to go sour for you? Well, it's when I lost my self-esteem and I lost my dignity inside of myself, and I lost my, virtually, you know, I lost myself. So, how'd you respond to that? I re-- I responded to it very negatively, evidently. I ended up getting myself in a little bit of trouble. - You wanna detail it? - Well, in trouble by using drugs and doing things that I shouldn't have been doing. We the jury, in the above entitled action, find the defendant, Todd Anthony Bridges, not guilty of simple assault in violation of penal code section 240... Wasn't there a time where you actually went to his house, Betty? - Yes. - And there you were. You went to his house. You were all dressed in black... - He nailed me out. And you were all dressed in black, - Mm-hmm. And you said, "I'm wearing black because..." I know you're gonna die. And I nail-- And he nailed me out of his house. He wouldn't let me in. He actually took furniture and nailed me out of the house. For me, I always thought everything was supposed to be fair. Like, everything's just supposed to be-- well, it has to be fair, but it just wasn't. And that's things you learn growing up as a child. That you learn things just aren't fair, you know. It's not going to be. From TV star to drug addict, it's Dana Plato's last chance. Just one month ago, former "Diff'rent Strokes" star Dana Plato told us she was getting her life back together. Now, she's been hauled back into court with a judge threatening, "One more mistake, and it's behind bars for good" Poor Dana. You know, to get people to believe that, "Oh, you just threw your life away." It's like, "Oh yeah, "I chose to throw my life away. Let me just throw my life-- I'm gonna throw everything I worked for away today." No one chooses that. It's something that happens, and then, you know, it's a tough journey, and Dana had a hard journey. What can I tell you, Dana? You're controversial, evidently. Are you sorry that you were a child actress? No, see, you know, that-- that term really bothers me. I think a child actress is someone who only has it when they're little and cute. You know? I'm better now than I ever have been. Acting-wise? Yes. - And I get better-- Yeah. I get better all the time. The fire's still in there. It is? So, you enjoy it? - Yes. I'm an actress. I consider myself an actor, - not a child star. - Right. That really bothers me a lot - Why? Because I never was young and cute, you know? I got cute as I got older, maybe, you know, but no really, I think it's something that it burns withi. You know, we all had our share of things we went through, but I think for Gary, it was a lot tougher because he was also ill while he was working. Sometimes when he was working, we didn't think he should be working at the time, but, you know, can't say what the parents are gonna do and that's up to them. If you did, you wouldn't have done this! I couldn't imagine being-- like, he had just had a kidney transplant at one time, and then he was back on the set, like, a day later. And, um, that's why for a while, he really resented the show. It was because he was made to work when he was sick. The death of a child star, Gary Coleman, who, as a boy, provided so much amusement, so many laughs on the hit show "Diff'rent Strokes" died today. My phone rang and I picked it up and found out he had passed away. You know, the interesting part is realizing that the person they thought would not be here is actually the last person standing, which is kinda weird. It's 7:33 now. An autopsy later today will determine the exact cause of death of one of Hollywood's rising stars, River Phoenix. Today's "New York Daily News" quotes a paramedic who said that the actor collapsed with all of the signs of a cocaine reaction. It happened outside the Viper Room, a popular West Hollywood night spot. Went out the door and, um, the paramedics were... uh, working on him. This young man, and I didn't, uh, I didn't know at the time that it was River. The, uh... media wouldn't let not only River rest, but they wouldn't let his family rest. River and I were real close. He was a year and a half older than me, but he was like an older brother who I looked up to. I'll see ya. Not if I see you first. I looked up to him as a person, I looked up to him as an actor, and I just treasured him as a friend. And then, around the time that I was... 15 or 16, he was kind of experimenting with drugs. And River and I began to sort of drift apart from each othe. Which really made me sad, but I remember thinking like, you know, when he's done with this, we'll be friends again. ♪ ♪ By the time River died, I hadn't talked to him for, gosh, a couple of years, and I couldn't believe it had happened. And I was, and remain, so angry at the predatory people around him who didn't try to help him. And I know addicts are responsible for their own behavior, and I know that, that it is, you know, it's important to, like, hold people responsible for the choices that they make. But we also need help in our lives, and we need people to look out for us, and I don't think there was anybody looking out for him. ♪ This talk is cheap ♪ I think that's one of the sort of pitfalls of being a kid in the entertainment business. It's so hard to, like, go from being a kid actor to being, like, an adult artist. ♪ I don't know how to trust you ♪ I stopped modeling. I stopped acting. I went to Europe. I recorded a record. At the time, I really thought it was music that I was gonna be able to leave my mark on the world with. The big turning point for me, on so many levels, but especially as an actress, because I had kind of written it all off, was, um, getting "The Fifth Element." ♪ ♪ I was 19. You know, to access a character like Leeloo that's kind of-- there was no reference point. She was kind of brand new and came out of nowhere. So it was, like, very tricky. Like, who is she and how to find her. Hi. Of course, when I-- when I did "The Fifth Element," it suddenly gave me this feeling of control that I had a talent and that I-- I knew how to... access it, in a way. And not all the time. I mean, sometimes more than others, and, you know, that's where you go through your journey of kind of understanding, like, what scripts speak to you when you just feel like, ooh, I can do something with this. Like, it feels natural. You know, or on the other hand, wow, this feels so crazy. Like, I want-- it's a challenge. Like now, you know, you get excited by things that you've never done before. Cut! But, you know, at the time, you know, it was difficult becoming a teenager and having that confidence. Like, I had no confidence as a teenager. You know, it was definitely like a "fake it till you make it." Luc Besson said to me, "You know, look at it this way. "Like, your mother is like an expert table-maker. "She makes the most amazing tables ever, "but you... You make great chairs." And I was like, yeah. I like that. It's true, you know? And it was interesting to be able to help me kind of appreciate my mother, but also separate and appreciate myself, too. Now with Mara Wilson. You undoubtedly know her from "Mrs. Doubtfire," "Matilda," many other movies. She's now revealing though the ups and downs of childhood stardom in her new book, "Where Am I Now?" It wasn't really until I was in my 20s and I was doing other things that I could finally make peace with it. And, eventually, I ended up writing a book about my life. And I knew, I'd always known that I wanted to do that. I understand you're thinking about becoming - a screenwriter. A scriptwriter. - Scriptwriter. You wrote a piece that was picked up in "The Huffington Post." - Mm-hmm. - And it really was about childhood fame, and in it... - There's a lot that I still want to do, and I'm not limiting myself, I think, into it, but for many reasons, I probably won't be, you know, a screen actor, you know, a big star like that, ever again. And I'm okay with that. I mean, I have this... I have a very devoted fan group, and that's nice. I haven't done a Disney project in over a year now. The people who watch me are still, a lot of the times, really young. I still wanna be a good example, and I still wanna-- But at the same time, right now, I'm doing a show about porn. And, like, I love that shit. Like, I'm-- That's what I'm supposed to be doing. I'm an actor, and I wanna do cool stuff. So, it's a weird balance, like, when you are... trying to break out of something, but I also feel the responsibility of being an example for these kids, and I take that seriously, you know? How do I marry what I'm actually doing and what I actually wanna be doing with what people wanna see from me and what people expect of me, um, and those two things are not the same. Show me minimum focus. Action! I'm just gonna go ahead and say I was bred to do this. It was about good work, and it was about working with good people, but it was also about saying something about something that you believed in, or moving people. And it's one of the reasons why I did films like "Thirteen," and why my parents allowed me to do films like that because they understood the value of showing something that was real that a lot of people don't wanna look at. And that's absolutely carried over into my activism. I now recognize our first witness. We'll go in this order. Ms. Wood, if you would, thank you. I'm here today to use my position as an artist, survivor, mother, and advocate to bring a human voice to the population of 25 million survivors in the US who are currently experiencing inequality under the law, and who desperately need basic civil rights. We need to pass the Sexual Assault Survivor Bill of Rights in all 50 states. We've done this in nine so far, and it's our job to make sure that survivors in the remaining 41 are treated with the same humanity and dignity. And this is called progress and it starts here. Thank you. I gave up my childhood for this industry, and it wasn't my choice. Right? I mean, it is what it is. I really like my life. I have a really good life. "Your friend, Wil Wheaton." It's my last one. I want you to have it. Look, everyone! Wil Wheaton is my friend! I have an amazing family, and I am a successful writer, and-- and, like, I'm good at being an actor. It's not my first choice. It's not, like, what gets me out of bed, but when someone's like, "We need an actor for this," I'm like, "I can do that." Right? I just developed that skill, you know? But when I tried to talk to my parents about it, and tried to... express how I felt, and-- and express my sense of loss and express my sense of... not having... not having these things that I wanted and needed, they weren't able to hear it. As a mother, it almost makes me feel like did I not do something right? Or why didn't I think to do that, as far as Marc's career is concerned. She always does everything right. Thanks. To you, I hope so. But it, it does make you think. Could I have gone that extra mile as a mom to maybe get him seen by somebody. But we still, we're gonna do pilot season again next year, and depending on how that goes, we possibly could do episodic season in the fall. It's really more about persistence than it is about being lucky, you know. Everybody else thinks it's lucky until you've actually been there, and then it's just, you know, one really good day after a lot of days of hard work. Mmm. Hello, Erin? - Yeah? - Is there any homework? So you said you wanted to go to summer camp. - Did you get to go? - Yeah, no. - No. - Were you disappointed? A little bit. A little bit 'cause most of my friends are going to sleepaway camp for the whole summer. But, I've been auditioning over the summer. I really just really, really, really wanna become a well-known actress and really get my, you know. When I was little, I used to always want my name on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. I used to be like, "I want my name to be on one of the stars," so that's something I really wanna do. I wanna become, like, a legacy and inspire other people to do what they love. That's my deepest dream, to do something for someone else. You face Roscoe! I'll face... I'll face this guy. Three, two, one! - And rip! - If someone had told me that, uh, my life would've been like this early enough where I coulda got out, I woulda got out. I'd say, uh, no. Have a normal life, and have friends. It's a half kid because I still think about that. That's something that I fantasize about. ♪ ♪ I find it very... scary, and I would not want my kids to pursue a career as a-- as a child. 'Cause I just find that it's so disruptive, you know? - Yes, my love. - My toe hurts. Your toe hurts. What part of your toe hurts? My daughter, my eldest, who's now 11, when she was four years old, she said, "Mommy, I wanna be on TV." My instincts are going, "You think you want this, "but if I allow you to do this, you're not gonna like it." I don't know. I guess it really is one of those things where, like, she wants to be an actress, and I wanna help her do what she loves to do because she's really got a natural ability for it. But, you're young. You don't need to, like, do a bunch of movies right now. Like, what you need right now is to become strong. Like... You need to be like a ship with full sails, with a crew that knows how to navigate. Like, I want you to be so strong. My son was in the business originally, and not anymore. But I was like, time to get him out, like, "You need to get out." You know, because it's great to a child. You build a nice bank account for when you get older, but you don't wanna stay in this business. I got him in a business that's reliable and great and, you know, make a lot of money and his name won't even be talked about, which is great. I feel like a role model 'cause I'm a mom, um, so that's really changed me... You managed to keep your son completely off of the internet. - Yeah. - Like, totally absent. It's been a very conscious decision, um. I think because of the way I was raised, I just don't wanna do anything that he doesn't have a say in yet. If he doesn't wanna be a public figure, if he doesn't want his image out there, I didn't wanna put it out there for him. Also, there's just a lot of creeps.
