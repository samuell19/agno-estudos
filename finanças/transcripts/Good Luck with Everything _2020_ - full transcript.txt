(waves crashing) (gentle music) - Hi, Paul, thank you so much for doing this. It's like last minute re-shoots, so you are saving my butt again. Okay, dog stuff, so lockbox wag code is 201 but I think I wrote that down, should be maybe on the fridge. When they eat, T's really particular about his food and will just like stare at it for a really long time. That's his choice, sure. But if you can just push all the bowls quite close together, I feel like it gives him some incentive to hurry up an eat which would be much easier and more efficient for everyone. If you can put just like a little bit of water with their food as well, just so it's like cereal, apparently it's good for their digestion, maybe. Actually, while I'm away, put Ripley's bowl in the spare room to eat, she gets a bit territorial about her food and then we'll try to go after the other ones. So, I mean, she's like usually really good about it, but maybe just while I'm away, just in case. Three walks a day. So if you just look after the first and the last, like morning and night, and then I'll have dog walker come in while you're at work. Barkley, he will bark at everything. (dogs barking) Emery arrives tomorrow, I'm so jealous that I'm not gonna be there. She's really awesome and I think you will love her. And yeah, what a bummer, I'm not gonna be there, which is always the way I feel like. Oh, and if you can walk, oh, sorry, transpo van is coming. Okay, water the plants, if you can. You're the best. I love you so much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. Okay, I'll speak to you soon. (lips smacking) Bye. - Hey Maggie, looks like you're having fun in the big city. We are all good here. The dogs are not in the living room with me, but they are here. I'm working tomorrow, but on Wednesday and Thursday you don't need a dog walker because I'm not working. And I can not wait to meet Emery. She seems awesome, so. Wish you were here too but you keep having fun and doing your thing in New York. Oh, and I got your plants covered, no worries, all right. I'll talk to you soon, bye. (lips smacking) (car horn honking) - [Announcer] Loading dock two, for intake four one five - So Paul, what we're doing is we're reconfiguring the warehouse, we're checking inventory up in the racks. It need you to go to location, E01H5. - It's like, why do I hire a property manager, if you're gonna call me as much as the tenants would? If you need a plumber Call a plumber don't call me. Like I have a Rolodex of plumbers and everything, that's your job. - That's why I don't do apartment real estate. I mean, why do you have an extra job when you have this one, you know? - Why is that hard for you? - [Paul] I'm just understanding why you work here and also have real estate, that's all. - So what, I should just have real estate and sit at home all day? - [Paul] A lot of people just have real estate. - That's what you would do? You would just sit home all day, if you were me, and not work? It's a family thing, you know that, it's my responsibility. How's the breakup going, enjoying that? - Yeah, it's fun to be alone. I didn't look at her Instagram all weekend, so I chalk that up as a win. - No, good for you. - Yeah. - That's a real big win for you. - [Paul] Thanks man. - Don't you think maybe you should get over it by now? - I know that, thank you. - You guys were together, what, three and a half, three years, four years? - Three and a half. - Three and a half. - Yeah. - So that should take you. - As much time as I need. - Three and a half months and you should be over it. - Again, like, that's your way of getting over somebody. For some people it takes more time, that's it. - You just like the simmer in it for years and ruin any possible chance for a real relationship. - I have a different mindset in the way in which I fall in love with somebody than you do. - Yeah, it's like, I don't do it right when I see them. - Break. - What's that? - Break up with them. - No, I don't fall in love with every girl I look at. - I don't do that. - Just because we have sex, doesn't mean I'm going to fall in love with you and then freak you out and send you running like you do. - Hey, hey, Paul, can you give Noelle a tour please? - Yeah, sure. - Hi. - Hi. Hey, I'm Paul. - Nice to meet you, Noelle. - Nice to meet you, hey. - Lewis, Lewis. - Nice to meet you. - Lewis, Lewis, you hear that? - Lewis, Lewis, got it. - [Lewis] Enjoy the tour.

So aisle N has a lot of shirts. - Cool. - Actually all the aisles have a lot of shirts. So yeah, we basically, if we need a certain shirt, we'll send a picker to grab it and then a sorter will then get the shirts that we need to ship out. - Cool. - What exactly are you hired to do? - I'm a checker. - Oh, okay, yeah. - Yeah. - I kinda, I check too. - Right. And you're the store man manager, store foreman. - I'm the foreman, yeah. - Cool. How long have you worked here? - I've worked here for three years. - Cool. - Yeah. - Do you live nearby? - Right now, I'm house sitting for a couple of dogs and they're a little bit of a handful, but yeah. - Have you ever tried using a laser pointer, pointing around? - With the dogs? - Yeah, my girlfriend does that with her cat. It exhausts the crap out of them. - Wears 'em out hah? - Yeah, yeah. - You have a girlfriend. - Yeah. - Cool. So this aisle right here is aisle... - C. - Exactly. (Paul laughing) Where is it, where is it? Ripley, don't come after me. What do you guys want to play tonight, Pictionary? - [Woman] Let's do variety. - All right, yeah. - Hey Paul, what's up? I'm just calling to say hi, I haven't heard from you in a little bit. The kids were wanting to know if you were coming to the 4th of July cookout, in our backyard, which is a very big deal this year. They're very excited. They're in charge of the fireworks and they said that they need your help. So we'd love to have you. Give me a call or text me and let me know what your plan is. And also just to say hi 'cause I haven't heard from you in a bit. So anyway, I love you, okay. Yeah, I'm coming. Sorry. - Hey Ally, yeah.

Everybody's gonna be there, it's gonna be a good time. - All right, maybe. - Everybody is coming over. Everyone is coming over. - Yeah, I know. - Hey Noelle you still coming tomorrow night to the party? - Yep. Why are you shouting? - Because you're far. I'll see you at lunch. - Hey, you found the smoking corner. - Hey, yo. - Hey. - Mind if I take a seat with you. - Heck yeah. - Smoking on the second day, huh? - Yeah, it keeps on, like going out. - There you go. - 'Cause it's so windy. - That's good. - You know what I'm saying. - You liking it so far? - Yeah. Yeah, I like it. - Good. - It's fun. - Yeah. - How are you, how's, how's dog sitting? - Dog sitting's great. The laser pointer was a great idea. - Really? - Yeah. They loved it. - Knew it. - They were literally running. - They go nuts for that shit. - It's insane. They were running around and it was like, it was hysterical. - Sometimes I worry that it'll make, it'll make like dogs or cats kind of lose their mind because it's this thing that'll just appear out of nowhere, so then they're constantly gonna be looking for now. - Yeah, I saw that in Barkley's eyes. Like, he like was like. - Who's Barkley, the dog? - Oh yeah, sorry, yeah, he's the dog. Barkley, Theo and Ripley. - Cute. - Yeah, they're all really cute. But Barkley like would just stand at attention, kinda like this the whole time. (Noelle laughing) It's insane. - You should see cats do it, man, they're like nuts. - They love it too. - I'm gonna use your back 'cause the wind won't let me keep my flame. Hold on. - Yeah, sure, it's what it's there for. - I'm gonna light you up. Do you want some pizza? - I'm okay, that's not. - I found this on the fridge. - That wasn't yours, but. - Oh, you do know that. - Yeah, no, that's Mario's. (Noelle laughing) - Yeah. - Mark said that it was in the fridge for a while. So I was like this is mine. - I think Mark said that because Mario brings it in every day. So he has like a slice of pizza every day. (Noelle laughing) - Oh my God. - Yeah, so. Mario's not gonna have lunch today, but luckily the taco truck's here. (Noelle laughing) - It's fucking good. - Yeah. - Italian bread. - He makes it. - What? - Yes. - It's so good. Oh my God. - And Mark knows that too. I think he was just like, that's not good. - Well it fed me, fed my soul. - Yeah. - I have to get back to work. - Yeah, high as a kite, you're ready to rock, go for it. - All right, that's not gonna work. - Yup. - I was gonna do one of those rolls, you know. - Well, I didn't know if you were trying to do like a tuck and roll or just a. - A what?

Five minutes, okay, let me, I'll pull my car up a little bit and you can just pull into my spot behind me, okay. I'm the Mazda. So I'm the farthest one over to the left. That's not gonna be your bed. What's going on? - How's it going? - Good. - Good. Sorry, I'm gonna roll up my window. I think I just rolled that tree up into my window. - It's okay. - What's up? - It's not my tree. - Hey. - Hey, how are ya? - I'm good, how are you? - Nice to meet you. Oh, can I help you with your bags? - No, no, no, I'll just grab my backpack, that's all I need right now. - Okay, cool. - Oh my God, oh. - Drive was okay? Oh my God, so long, but I'm so happy to be here. - Right. - Yeah. - You're finally in LA. - Oh my God, look at the babies. - Yeah, so that's Barkley on the right there. And then Ripley is a little white guy. - [Emery] Yes. - Living room. - Cool. - Okay. Kitchen is in here. - Nice. - Alrighty. And then the spare bedroom, where you're staying, right here. - Amazing. - Alrighty. - Thank you. - You got it. - This is so great. - Yeah. Have you had dinner yet? - No, have you eaten yet? - I have not. - Wanna get some food? - Yeah. Let you set up here. - Okay, cool. - Cool. So how long did it take you to come on out? - Like two and a half weeks. - Okay. - But I took time. And it still didn't feel like that much time, but it was like, you know. No, no you go. - I was gonna say, did you have a favorite stop? - Oh my God, I love Montana, I love New Mexico. - I went through New Mexico, that was good. - Yeah. - Yeah. - You took a road trip? - I did, I stopped in Santa Fe, I actually got a ticket there. - For what? - Well I was distracted, which is not good driving, but I was going 60 in a 35. - Okay. - And that was in Tulum, not, it's like Tatum, Mexico, which is really New Mexico. - Right. - Super small. And then right after that I hit a bird by accident. Shouldn't have been going that fast. - Poor bird. - Yeah. But it was a fun trip. But New Mexico is beautiful. Santa Fe with that sunset. - I would live there so fast. - Yeah. - If there was like a legitimate way for me to make money in New Mexico, I would live there in a heartbeat. - It was beautiful. There's so many parts of, you know, this country that you just don't realize how beautiful they are. - What's this? - This is a pawn shop. - Oh my God. - All right. - I've only ever been to L.A. like for three days, once. - Really? - When did you take your road trip? - It was five years ago. We got the crosswalk. - Okay. - Yeah, and that's actually when I met Maggie. Yeah, she was my first friend out here. - That's amazing. - She's cool. - Holy shit. - Yeah. - Yeah, love that girl. I'm so sad she's not here right now. I'm glad you're here but like, I'm sad she's not here. - It would be cool to have Maggie here too. - Yeah. - She really brings everybody together. - Yeah. - So this place has a really good sandwich. - Nice. - Best in L.A. - Okay, I'll take your word for it. But you know what I have heard? I've heard that L.A. food is way better than New York food. - I mean, I should take you to get like tacos or poke's really good here. - Poke? Oh, poke. - Poke, oh yeah sorry, poke. Is it poke? - Poke. - Is it poke? - I actually don't know, I'm pulling that out of my ass. (Emery laughing) - But yeah, I, of course went with the, you know, sandwiches. - No sandwiches are God's gift to the world. I'm so happy. - Here you go. - Okay, okay, thanks. Do you mind if I smoke a cigarette? - No, go for it. - Okay. Sorry, it's only a summer habit. - It's only a summer habit? - Yeah. - That's good. - Okay. Okay wait. - I don't have a lighter on me. - No, I got it. Do you smoke? - [Paul] No, I don't. - Good for you. - [Paul] I got plenty other vices. - [Emery] Oh yeah, like what? (Emery laughing) - Fuck off. - I swear too much. - Okay. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Drink too much. All the above. So what brings you out here? - To L.A? I don't know, like a lot of things. Well, my mom just died. - I'm sorry about that. - Thanks man, thanks. Yeah, she was sick for a while. But yeah, my mom just died and then I got out of this really bad relationship with this married couple. It kind of exploded and it was like weird. So I needed to get away. And I was like, there's just no way that I can stay where I am and go through another, I don't know, like a year there and I don't know. Okay, that's a lot. - I'm sorry to hear about your mom. - No, thanks man, thank you. I mean, I'm sorry about your mom. - Yeah, thanks. - And I kinda heard a little bit about the, well I saw like on your Instagram that you were in a relationship with two other. - Yeah, yeah. Honestly, it's crazy because when we first started dating, I was like, fuck being in a couple, like throuples are where it's at, like three people is great. Like the communication and it's like, you have to, you're like forced to be honest, you know. And it was really good, until it wasn't, then it was really, really bad. But yeah, it just got shitty. Mostly 'cause, you know, I got into it for her. 'Cause I've been historically gay, you know, I've only dated women. And then like I got into this thing 'cause she was like, "Hey, wanna date me? "But also if you date me, you have to date my husband." Anyway so we all got together and then it turned out that me and Kace just got along way better, which was such a surprise to everyone. And it kinda, it was like all downhill from there. Yeah, that was a lot. That was a lot of information. - No, that's, I mean, I'm happy you shared it with me. - Yeah. - It's cool. - Okay, what about you? - Well I guess we'll start, my parents got divorced when I was eight, so they're still both alive with different people. I didn't mean to say it like both, alive, I mean. - No, no, it's fine, please. - But yeah, moved out here five years ago, had a thing with a girl for about three and a half years, on and off. It just didn't work out. I never felt like I was enough with her, you know. But that's, I don't know, it's a, yeah, that one just kinda stuck, so. But Maggie's been a great friend through it all. - Yeah, yeah, she's a good one. - And you know, like, the bus comes along every 10 minutes, right. - What? What's the bus? - I don't know, like my mom always said that when like you break up with somebody. - There are a lot of fish in the sea. - Yeah, but she just used bus analogies. - Oh, so you're dating right now. - Yeah, I mean, a little bit like not a lot, but. - Yeah. - Trying, you know. - Good, good for you. That's great. - I say trying but more or less like barely. (Emery laughing) Barely doing anything with it. - Okay. - Yeah. - That's okay. - Yeah. I mean, I have like a dating site, but it's not. - You own the dating site? - I don't own an dating site, that's not what I meant. But I am on one dating site. - Cool, which one? - The worst one. (Emery laughing) - Okay, okay. Okay, I'm gonna finish this really quick and then we can go 'cause I'm really hungry. - Yeah, sorry about the sandwiches, but pasta will do, right? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh my God, it's so fine, it's so fine. I love pasta. I love Italian. I'm coming in baby girl. (cellphone pings) - [Kace] Hey, hey, hey. I'm just checking in to see if you made it to L.A. all right. And yeah, I'm trying to repaint the spare bedroom that you originally used to like white or eggshell or flat white, Amber doesn't remember, so I don't know, she's not even talking to me right now. I don't know, I think you leaving, clarified a few things. She thinks that like I pushed you away, I don't know. This is a lot, I'm sorry. It's just, yeah, that West Coast gig, I think it will pan out, I just need to talk to the producer about it. Got a photo shoot tomorrow. And yeah, I'll let you know, I'll just, yeah. Let me know about that white paint, is it flat or eggshell? Alright, love you, talk soon, bye. - Okay. - To be honest, I'm not much of a game player. - Okay, well that's good to know because to be honest, I've never made pasta before. - You're first time making pasta? How old are you? - I never make it. Doesn't matter. I just never made it, it was something I didn't enjoy as a kid. (Emery laughing) Just try it before you judge it hard, okay. - A, this is a lot of pasta and B, pasta is not supposed to look like this, not supposed to do that. - Okay. Well, when you do that, like it doesn't look that appetizing. But I'm just saying like there's sauce in it. - I mean, actually like wait, do you have more sauce? - This is all I have. (Emery laughing) - Okay. Oh my God, it's so dry. - You know what don't eat it. I'm just kidding. - No, no, no, I'm not kidding, but like I'm kidding. Okay. - Alright. - I have a word. I think. - Wait, did you just put one back? - No. - Yes you did. - No, I only have six. Look, I need seven. C-A-R, care bitch. - Care, okay. Okay, so that's three, four, five, six. I get six points. - Is that what you do, you stop at anything to win? - The fuck are you talking about? - [Paul] The fuck I'm talking about, you just looked at it. Yes you did. - Okay, okay. Would you rather be a winner or a cheater? Wait, wait, wait. - A winner, that's a very. - No, no, no, would you rather be a loser or a winner who cheats? - Right now, you're both. - I can't believe you just called me a loser. That's so mean. - Well 'cause it's the first word and you're already going for the thing. I mean, that's really ballsy. It's like, wow, "Okay, I'm down early, "so I'm gonna go, I'm gonna double down." - Okay, listen, honestly, do you know how every single game ends, every single board game has ended in my entire life, when I started losing, guess? No, I'm just gonna tell you. - [Paul] With the opponent with the slit throat? - No, no, I just fucking flip the board and I scream. I say like, I fucking hate you and hate you. It's really unlike me. - [Paul] That's good. - So I feel like I don't play games with people unless I've known them for at least half of my lifetime. - [Paul] Then why are we playing on the first night? 'Cause I feel like we gonna get off to a very rough start. - I know it's really bad, it's bad already, 'cause I'm losing. You know what? I'm going to fucking flip the board. Let's just do. Ready, one, two, three. - Two, three. Fuck this game. - I think that's a dog. - Is it? That is one, which one is it? You want to guess? You already see Ripley's out here so. - I bet it's Barkley. Ding, ding, ding, ding. - Hey buddy. - He's fully ready to go to sleep. - He's ready to go to sleep. - [Emery] Oh my God. - I liked that she put up your pictures. - Those are my pictures. - They are. - Yeah, wait how'd you know that? - I recognized the car one earlier. - By the map. - Yeah. No, no, no, the car one, that one. - Oh yeah, yeah. - I saw it on your Instagram. - Yeah, you Instagram stalking me, Paul? - No, I just want to make sure you know, the person who's staying with me isn't a murderer, so. - Yet to be seen right? - TBD, yeah. - Yeah, TBD. - Exactly. - Okay, I'm tired. - I'll get these guys out of here for you. - Oh fuck, I gotta take out my contacts. - Alright. - Okay, yeah. - Okay Rip. Okay bud. All right, I'm gonna take you in my room, okay. Come here buddy. Okay, ready. Alright, I'll come back for you, Barkley. All right, come on, Rip. (basin water running) Goodnight. - Night.

Long time no see. - Good to see you. - Yeah, hey. Sorry for being creepy sitting over there, I was watching you with the dogs. I was over at Coffee Commissary. - Okay. - I was writing a script and I thought, yeah, Doug, you know Doug, you know Kimberly. - Yeah, okay cool. - But I just thought I'd come over and say hi to ya. - Okay, well, hey, what are you writing about? - I'm sorry, there's no script, I lied. I saw that Maggie was in New York from Instagram, so I thought I'd just come over and see if. Listen, I got a self tape that I need to shoot and. - I've never done one, so I don't. - Yeah, but I know she's got like a setup up there and I was wondering if maybe we could just like, help me knock one out. It would take like five minutes. - I mean, don't they have the things that you can go to and you can, I think Maggie, before she had all that stuff, she'd used that. - Yes, they do, but they're like expensive and I can't afford it right now. - You can afford coffee, but you can't get the. - Well coffee's significantly cheaper. I don't think you realize how expensive those places are, yeah. - Of course, yeah. Well I would, but I'm supposed to be over James's house later and it's like my off day, so. - Oh it's your day off? - Yeah, that's why I was. - It'll be super quick and I'll owe you lunch. - Okay. - When I can get paid next. - All right, yeah, okay, let's go do it now then. - Really? - Yeah. Come on let's go. - Oh my God, thank you so much, you're the best. - Great. - How's it going? - I'm good, good, it's good to see ya. - I like the shirt, you're wearing colors now. - Yeah, I'm trying to light up my life. - Yeah, they look good on you. - Go, go, go, go, go, go. - Hey. - Hey Emery. - Hey. - Hey Emery. - [Paul] This is Nick, Emery. - Hey Nick. - How's it going?

I don't know who to call, I mean. - [Emery] Yeah, well did you call tech support? - Yeah, no. - Okay, so call tech support. 'Cause they'll just walk you through it, they like take over your computer and then I don't know, walk you through stuff, but they'll probably find it, I'm sure it's fine. - Yeah, okay. - [Emery] No, no, no, it's good, yeah. It's totally gonna be fine. It happened to me and I lost all my shit 'cause I don't back stuff up, but you're really good at backing stuff up, so. - Yeah, it's just one of those things, where you're just stupid. - [Emery] It's totally good. Okay, so call tech support, let me know it happens, but you should be fine. - Alright cool. Alright, I'll let you know how it goes. - Okay. - Alright bye. - Bye. - Am I supposed to read both Griff and Michael? - Yeah. - Okay. Do you want different voices or? - No, same voice.

I thought you were gonna be like, "Yeah, she leaves her dishes in the sink "and she got in late last night." And you're like describing her personality. - [Paul] No, we're becoming friends, that's it. - She's sleeping like 10 feet away from you. - [Paul] She's sleeping in another room. - 10 feet away from you. (water splashing) I'm excited to go to this party tonight. - It's gonna be fun. Lewis' place is always a good time. - I'm like I'm like ready to meet new people again, finally.

(Noelle shouting) - Go, go, go, go. - Get it, get it. - [Lewis] Come one. (all laughing) - It really is. - It's just fun. - No it really is, 'cause everyone gets mean and then I feel like I wasn't athletic enough and then it's a whole freaking thing. - Hey, hey, that was great. - I need a second. - My mom was always like stealing stones from neighborhoods, like my whole life, is just, she's always like, "Look at this rock I got." - Oh no, my mom stole stones too. But from like the Grand Canyon. - Okay, that's better. (Emery laughing) - Hey, little tip, start shaving the back of your neck, girls don't like that shit. - Okay. - I know you're Greek and proud of it, but you look fucking stupid. - All right, thank you for. - I do love you. - We had donkeys and goats and horses and fish and we had a pet skunk. - He's growing up with pet skunks. - High school, yeah, okay. - I feel like when I was in high school, when I first got boobs, I felt like such shame, having boobs. - Yes, shame. Fuck man. - But you shouldn't feel. I don't know. - No, I know, I know. It's like, you look great right now, it's totally good. - You want to shave it right now? - No. - Let me shave your beard. - No, no. - I have a straight razor, I've never used it. - No. - Let me shave your beard, dude. - I'm gonna shave it when I go home. - No, I'll shave it right now. - No, I don't want you to shaving my face when you've been drinking. - It's not like driving. - I know, but it's just my face and I don't think. (Paul burping) Excuse me. - So we go out there and I remember, I'm in like cutoff shorts and my dad and I are trying to round up these little skunks, we're picking them up by their tail. And when a baby skunk is like fresh, they just have no control over their sprayer. So we're getting sprayed in the face, mist is happening, we drop them in a box and then my sister comes out, spoiled little brat. Oh, got a little skunk hair on me, huh? - Sorry, I'm with you. - Okay. - But okay, just to like circle back though, I'm right, the fire was the first human invention. - Okay, yeah. - Okay, yeah. - I'm just like, yeah. - We should know that. - There was definitely like a fucking, like, everyone's always like, yeah, "The man who made fire." But it was definitely a woman don't you think? I think so too. - Yeah, a woman discovered that shit. - For sure. - For sure. - The guy was out being like. - Yeah, fucking lazy or whatever. - Kill something. - Yeah, aggressive, aggressive or lazy that feels correct. - And she was like, hold on a sec, hold on, I'm gonna make fire. - Yeah, yeah. (Emery laughing) - Should we get more liquor? I feel like we're running out of what beer, fast. - Yes, yeah, yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Let's just go to the bodega. - Leave the fire, fuck it. - Yeah, yeah, fuck it, it's fine. It's totally good, everybody's here. - What are you doing? Why are you in the city? Go away, you have a family now. - They pay you rent. - Yeah, so. Get outta here, get outta here. They call me, they always want stuff. - That's, I mean. - Like this one tenant keeps complaining about his heater. - It's cold. - It's fucking Southern California, it's not cold. - I mean, just fix the heat, it's your job. - Go somewhere warm if you wanna be warm. If you want to be cold, go somewhere, go to Minnesota. - They don't want to be cold. - Why do they have to call me, call your mom or something. - They're calling you because you're. - For warmth. - Trying to spray him, you know, give them a little scare. It thought it was like running the house, and then it would jump up on the couch and it would lay on its back and look into your eyes. - And that's when you knew you were gay. - When I knew I was what? - Gay. - Oh gay. (James laughing) (basin water running) (music plays) (music plays) (Brando laughing) (cellphone ringing) - [Emery] Hi, you've reached. (car engines revving) (crickets chirping) (car engine revving) - [Commentator] 107 yards and a touchdown. Once again from the gun, fake, Mahomes at side on delivered, as Sammy Watkins. Ball pops free at the end, Ravens came sliding. - Hey. - Hey, what's happening? - Nothing, you? - Nada. - [Commentator] Back at the 49. Wide receiver set but they'll run Ingram on the outside. Busting through, Ingram stumbles across the 40. [Commentator] Third and five, Jackson, over the middle, Jackson connects Mark Andrews. Third and 10, Baltimore will go empty. [Commentator] Jackson. - What you watching? - [Paul] Some sports highlights. - [Commentator] Keeps the play alive. [Commentator] Jackson stumbles across the 10. - Sure, thank you. - Okay. You good? - I'm good. - Are you mad at me? - No, not mad at all, I just, tried to call you. - I know, my phone died. - No, no, it's cool. - I'm so sorry. - I just didn't know where you went, I was like, I'm gonna head out. - No, Noelle and I went to go grab beer and then we got sidetracked, we just like walked our blocks and sorry. - [Paul] No, no, hey, it doesn't matter. - No, no, sorry. - That's cool. - No, it's nice that you're like keeping tabs on me, dad. - I'm not your dad, no. - You're not my dad, that's true. No, but seriously, I'm sorry, that was rude of me, I should've, sorry. Wanna cheers it out. - Yeah. - Okay. - Cheers. So you wanna like, you wanna talk? - Talk? - I don't wanna like interrupt your thing, I just like. - No, no, we can. - You're not mad right? - No, I'm not mad at you. - Okay, sorry. - We already cheersed. - I know, okay. - All right. - All right. Okay, I have questions that I like to ask people. - Okay. - You ready? - Sure. - Okay, my favorite question to ask people is, what is your favorite, your personal favorite compliment, you've ever received to your face? Okay, it's a two part question. - Do I need to write it down? - No, no, no, it's gonna be good. Okay, what is your personal favorite compliment that you've ever received to your face and also behind your back? Meaning like you heard it through the grape vine that somebody said something really nice about you. - To my face, the nicest thing someone said about me? - Yeah. No, not the nicest, like your personal favorite compliment? - The nicest thing someone said about me? To my face, that I was thoughtful. - Well, that's nice. That's nice. - Yeah. - Behind my back. - Yeah. That's a tough one. - Okay, yeah. I'll tell you mine so that it'll like spark something, right. - Yeah, that'll help. - Okay, okay. 'Cause I don't know my actual to my face compliment, but my behind my back compliment is that, two of my friends were talking about me on the phone once, I heard it, because one of my friends told me, and they were like, "I wonder what Emery is doing right now." And they both were like, this is how they said it went, they both got like really quiet for a second and then at the same time were like, I bet she's doing whatever she wants. And I was like, fuck, that's such a good, that's my favorite thing that anyone's ever said about me. I am like, put that on my tombstone, you know, "Here lies Emery, died doing whatever she wanted." - No one has ever said that cool thing about me. That's for sure. Never. - That's okay. - Like I was gonna say like that I'm a good boyfriend. That's pathetic. That's puts it to shame compared to yours. - [Emery] It's great to be a good boyfriend. - God, "Here lies Emery, just fucking "enjoyed the shit out of her life. "And then Paul, he was an okay guy." - [Emery] I heard that you were a great boyfriend. - Yeah, "I heard you were a great boyfriend, "too bad you died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound." Just kidding, just kidding. - Whoa. - I know, God sorry. - That got real dark, real fast. - Sorry, are you hungry? - Yes. - Wait, do we have it? - [Emery] I just assumed you said, "No, we don't have it." But I said son of a bitch at the same time you said something. - No, we don't have it. - Son of a bitch. Yeah, we didn't go grocery shopping. - [Paul] Have you ever had cold pizza? - You're just, fuck it like, "Yeah, eat some cold pizza "cause I don't wanna cook this shit up." - Right, I don't. - No, that's good, that's good, it's fine, it's late. Cold pizza is actually, it's Chinese food and pizza, the two things that are just maybe better cold than they are not cold. Okay, you ask a question now. - Okay, my question. Are you a virgin? - Am I a virgin? If I said yes, would you believe me? - I'd be worried, but I would believe you because you're honest. - I'm like clocking if that was a compliment. Wait, that took me a second. - It's a compliment. - It is? - Yeah. - Okay. Yes, no, no I'm not a virgin, I'm 33, what the fuck? - Good. - Are you a virgin? - No, but my virginity story, like, I mean. - Okay, well now you have to tell. - Okay, I was working a summer job at Eagle's Nest Country Club, I was working the snack bar, and there was a really pretty girl, Jordy Bollinger. - Wow, what a name. - Right, she was a swim instructor at the pool. - Whoa, sexy. - Yeah. - Really hot. - It was a 4th of July party and we were having a lot of fun and yeah, we, you know, had sex for about like 10 minutes or so I think. - What? Oh my, okay, sorry, I'm listening, I'm listening. - It's okay. Then I went home and I was like smiling in my bed. Like, you know, like, oh it happened or whatever. And then like the next day I went to work and all my buddies from work are laughing when I walk in and I found out that she had sex with a guy right after I left. - What? - Yeah. - Oh man. Wait so she had sex with you at a party and then you left and she had sex with another guy. - Yeah, it's nice when you repeat it too, it makes me feel really good about it. - Sorry dude, oh my God. - It's okay. - I'm just making sure I have the facts straight. - No, it's good, I mean, like it's probably where it all started with like, not like feeling like I'm enough, you know. - Oh shit, shit, yeah, sorry. - [Paul] It's okay, these things happen. - No, that's real. - Yeah. Did you lose your virginity to a guy or a girl? - Whoa, blunt. I'm just kidding, I'm an open book. - Sorry. - It's fine. I had sex with a guy first, only one guy ever my entire like twenties, early thirties, and then I met Kace and he was the only other guy. Okay, so I had sex when I was in college. - Okay. - So not so young, yeah. - [Paul] Probably a bit smarter to wait. - Well, I had sex with this guy and then after that I had just had sex with women for like the next decade. - Wow. - Yeah. I told him that actually, and he was like, "Fuck, was it me?" - I would think that too. - You would think. You would think like, "Shit, I really fucked it." - I fucked it up. - [Emery] God, that's so self absorbed. - It's okay, I know, men. - Selfish. - I know. - Yeah, how dare you take away my queerness, you know. You ever had sex with a guy? - I have not, no. - You ever make out with a guy? - No, that's not been on my. - Just a little butt stuff. - No butt stuff, I mean. I have to think, am I? - No. - No. No butt stuff. - No butt stuff. - No butt stuff. Not yet, but. - Oh, I like that you're open to it though. - Yeah, not really. (both laughing) - I get excited when men are like, you know, open to stuff. - I'm in to butt stuff then, yeah, for sure. - Shut the fuck up. - Yeah, I'm definitely into butt stuff. - Yeah, let's let's do butt stuff right now. - Okay, don't make it weird. - Sorry. (both laughing) (sizzling) - Oh, okay yeah. Cool. - Morning. Night shoots are killing me. And there's this one sound guy, he's like a little too handsy, you know. It's like, read the year. So, just an idea and no pressure, but you should take Emery to the beach, she loves the beach, it'll be good for you. The ocean's like really, you know, cleansing and stuff. Okay. Love you, bye. - She's doing good. - Bye. You think that security camera outside actually works? - No. She put it up there as a fake. - Oh my God. I kinda wish it worked, I was out there like picking my nose and like look up, it's like this red thing beeping at me. - You wanna know like who's watching that? - Is this for me? - That's for you, yeah. - Thank you. Good, nice. - Believe it or not, no salt or pepper. - Yeah, believe it. It's good though. Better than your pasta. (Emery laughing) No, no, it's good, it's good. - Cool. I was thinking, you wanna go to the beach today? - Yeah, yeah, I have some work to do, but then I would love to. - Okay. - Is that what you're gonna wear to the beach. No, I'm not, I'm not like. - I was thinking about it. - I'm just thinking that if we go to the beach, I'll bring my camera, and if I bring my camera and you're the only person I'm with at the beach, you're probably gonna end up in photos. - You're gonna take pictures of me today. - [Emery] Yeah, yeah. (music plays) - Yeah, that's it. - I think the last photo I took was with. - Don't talk while I'm taking photos your mouth is gonna be moving all over. - I've never taken pictures. - No, no, no, it's okay, just try it one more time, just no talking. - Sorry, I'm trying to figure out how to do like the whole. - Oh my God, you're still talking while I'm taking shots. - I'm sorry. - Just stop. No, no, no, it's fine. - Okay, all right, okay. - It's fucking good. - Am I knocking it out of the park? - Yeah, yeah. - Here we go. - Okay, once more other hand. - Okay, two hands? - [Emery] Yeah, I fucking love surfing. - Me too, I freaking. - Yeah, you surf? - Not at all. - I don't surf either. - [Paul] I want to, but I've just never have had the balls to do it. - Dude, we should take a surfing lesson. - You tell me the day and I'm there in a heartbeat. - Really? - Yes, I want to do it. I'm waiting for somebody to do it with me so that I can actually drive down the PCH to do it. - I think surfing is one of those things that I feel like I would be really good at and then it'll be really hard and I might suck. - [Paul] I feel like I would be terrible. - See that's good, you set the bar really low. I should have that perspective where I'm like, I'm going to go in sucking, and then if I do anything other than suck, I'll feel really great about myself. - Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna fail, so I never do it at all. (Emery laughing) - We both just said the same thing, I just said suck and he said fail. - Yeah, but. - We both have the same fear. - But you would actually do it. Me, I'm like chicken shit, I'm like, I'm not gonna do it. - Yeah, well you're doing it with me, 'cause we're gonna take a lesson. - All right, fine. - Oh, pinky swearing. - [Paul] Now, we're gonna do this then we go. - No. Now you spit. - Wacha! - What? - [Paul] What, do you spit? - What do you, wacha? Okay, no, do it again, pinky swear. - Wacha! - I'm not gonna say that. - Okay, deal. - Okay. Wacha. - Now you said it, there you go. "I'm not gonna say it, "there's no way I'm gonna say it." And then you say it. - What the fuck? - What the fuck is that? - [Emery] That is a family of Segways. - Jesus Christ. (Emery laughing) When a family does that, that's like, "Hey, we're a bunch of nerds, we're the nerds." You know what I mean? - [Emery] Are they nerds or are they the coolest. - They might be the coolest in the world. - Among us. - You're right. (Emery laughing) - [Emery] I don't know, I mean, maybe. - I mean, you're really cool. - I am cool. - You're the coolest. - No, no, you're cool. - No, you're cool. - No, no. Let's not do that. - Okay. But you know, you're cool, right? - Yeah. - You are the definition of cool. You take pictures, you charge people millions of dollars and you live on a couch. That's pretty cool. What is that? I'm gonna have glitter now. You're gonna ruin the shoot, are you kidding me? (Emery laughing) Everyone's gonna think I'm a fairy godmother. - [Emery] Well now you're cool too. - Now I'm cool. - [Emery] It's just the glitter that makes me cool. I take it off and I'm just a fucking nerd. - No it's still on and you look, even when it's off, I'm sure you're cool. (cellphone ringing) Is your phone ringing? - Shit, hang on. - What do you got? - It's Noelle. - [Paul] I don't even have her number yet. - Noelle Party, is her and my phone. - Noelle Coworker. (Emery laughing) - [Noelle] Hey. - [Emery] What the fuck is she eating? - [Noelle] Last night was so much fun. I'm wondering if you guys wanna hang out. - She wants to hang out, you wanna hang out? - [Paul] Yeah, let's hang out. - Cool, do you know where she lives? - I don't know where she lives, I don't have her number, I have no idea. - Okay cool. What's your address? (birds chirping) (gentle upbeat music) - Hey, yo. - Hey. - [Paul] There she is. - Hello friends. - In overalls. - I know, I'm like a little farmer girl. - Yeah. - Right, looking good. - How's it going, guys? - Hey. - Okay, are you ready?

Treat, treat, treat, treat, treat. - Barkley's like, I don't. He doesn't trust it. Here, I got him, I got him. He doesn't trust it. - He's like, "I wanna stay with the women." I love video games. I feel like I'm not good at the ones that go like this though. Like the ones where you have to like move your head. There's like two controllers. Here we go. Here we go. And here we go. - There is. - This is what I'm talking about. My head has to move first, my gun second. Bam, gotcha. (virtual gun firing) Double bam. Flaming trash cans. - Oh my God. You're good at this. - Am I good? Or is this the beginner round? Some zombies are gonna start shooting at me while I have to get this. But then at that point I won't be able to manage 'cause my neck will have to move, before I started running. (all laughing) I feel like no one knows what I'm talking about. - No, I can see the quick jolts that you're talking about. - Neck move, neck move. (Emery laughing) Do you have any games that are just one button? Are you gonna get that yellow thing? No. - No. Out of the way. - Just the pink things, are you going for? - Oh my God. - Well, I think they're called moons. - Definitely not a moon. - Yes it is. - No, those are asteroids. - No, those are moons. - Definitely asteroids. Do you know what the definition of a moon is? - The thing that comes out at night. What? Isn't that what it is? - Wait, give me your actual definition of what you think a moon is. (all laughing) - [Paul] The thing that comes out at night. - [Noelle] The thing that comes out at night. - Yeah. - No, it's always there. - [Paul] Look in the dictionary, that's what it says. - It's always there, actually. - I thought you're going to be more hippy and be like the thing that like makes women get their periods. - The thing that everyone's horoscope is all about, right? - That's just like planets. - Yeah. - No, it's just. - Each time he says his own definition of a moon. It's as far away as possible. (Emery laughing) - [Paul] Is it? - Noelle and I are on the same page, I don't know where you at? - Okay, well you guys are on page 67 and I'm already going towards the end of the book. - Honestly, okay, we gotta watch the movie, I seriously can't play this game anymore. - This is a game from the '80s. - [Paul] Yeah. - This is one of those things where, I used to play this game on my computer all the time.

Yeah, totally. I have like the smallest bed in the world. It's literally like a futon, that's like this small, like ideally I had Paul's bed, he's got a king size, but you're welcome to crash. - I feel like that seems intense. I'm like, hey, I met you yesterday. - No, no, it's fine. - Can I sleep in your extremely small futon? - It's fine. How many piercings do you have? - Just two, two in each ear. - Two on either side? - Yeah. - That's it. - It's not really impressive. - No, no, it's great. I got my nose and my ears. I used to want to have my whole, like. - Not interested. You didn't want it in? - No, I just like never got around to doing it. - You should get a second one, it's really fun, you can put like two different earrings in it. Where'd you get this glitter? I've never seen glitter like this. - Oh yeah. - It's like chunky. - I know. - I love it. - It's okay. - I had a dream. - Wow. - I know. - That's is so dope. (Emery laughing) - I always like feeling if somebody's tats or like raised. - I know. - 'Cause I think sometimes they get. - You think, not really not after it heals. You don't have any tattoos? - No. - Do you ever want tattoos? - No. - No. (Emery laughing) - I'm afraid that if I get something, I'm not good with like styling tastes, so I feel like I'll like put something on and be like, that is dumb. - Well, don't put it right here. (Emery laughing) - [Noelle] Like a Rose. - I mean, okay, I think, my theory on tattoos is that they represent a time in your life and it doesn't have to be a thing that you love forever, you just can look at it and be like, "Yeah, "that time in my life that I had a dream "and then it just happened." - Come on guys, let's go, let's go. - Oh okay. - I know. - [Noelle] This is real cute. I'm gonna roll off. Oh my God. You know what? I'll sleep on this part. - Come on. Come on guys. Come on, come on bud. - [Man] The main key of all there maneuvers is to basically stay in the power source of the wave, which is in the pocket where the white water is breaking. (gentle upbeat music) (birds chirping) - [Announcer] Paging Paul, dock three, dock three, Paul. - Okay, so I'm trying to figure out why the order on paper doesn't match what physically came in. - Well, Fox Print had a duplicate order. There's supposed to be two of them. - There's only one here, all right. - I know I did two. - Yeah. - I was like what is this? But this first one was all the large, Xls and 2Xls and then the other one was like kid sizes. - Okay. I think this may have been Martha's order, before she went on maternity leave. So let me just go up front and check her desk and make sure it's not just sitting up there. - Okay, thanks Mark, appreciate it. - Cool, thanks. - Hey. - Hey. - That was so fun last night. - Yeah, it was a blast. - Yup. Are you gonna be weird about it? - Nope. Just went in and checked on the dogs and then you guys were in the bedroom and I had the night with the dogs. So yeah, it wasn't weird at all. Just. Yeah. - Okay. Don't make it weird. (machine blowing) - I'm not making it weird. - Okay, fine. - Okay. (machine blowing) - Okay, all right. Okay, okay, okay, all right. - [Noelle] I feel like the Terminator. It's so early. - It is early. - Yeah, all right, come here, I wanna show you something. - What you got? - Wait for it, wait for it.
