[WIND BLOWING] [BATS CHIRPING] [WINGS FLAPPING] [SCRATCHING] Is someone out there? [GLASS CLINKS] [GLASS CLINKS] [SCRATCHING] Who's out there? [GLASS CLINKS] [SCRATCHING] Hello? [CROAKING] [SCRATCHING] [CROAKING] [SCREAMS] [GLASS SHATTERS] [MUSIC PLAYING] Come on, let's go. What do you think? I think it's spooky. I don't know. It looks abandoned. OK. R and R. Five minutes. What the hell are we stopping for? We ought to be double timing. Ow! What's wrong? It's bursitis. JAKE: What? It's like tennis elbow, except I get it in my shoulder. Are you belly aching again? It's sensitive! I'll show you sensitive. Whoa, whoa. It's about to rain. I don't see any rain. There. Aw, shit. [THUNDER] OK, we've got to find cover. There, this building. Hey, there's a door! MAN: For right now, be careful. [THUNDER] [THUNDER] [HISSING] What do you think? Could be anything. May be penetrated. Yeah, by us. Quiet. They could still be in here. Who? Could be friendly. Nah, not with our kind of luck. Hello? Anybody home! Hey, you left the lights on! [SQUEAKING] [GASPS] Go for it. Mice. Rats, I can smell them. Yeah, OK, OK. Let's do a little recon. Blanca, you and Butch over there. Kate, you and I over here. 40 paces, no further. Now rendezvous back here in five minutes. Maybe we shouldn't. We don't know what's in there. Yeah, well, we're going to fucking find out. Now let's hump it. 40 paces. No farther. What about me? Come on. You don't think this setup's weird? I just think they left in a hurry, that's all. Like us. Come on. Let's check the next one. Come on. Come on! Let's go. What do you think? Probably livestock food. They need a continuous supply, and by breeding their own stock, it could be indefinite. I don't think so. Why not? Well, what else then? I'm not sure. All right. Let's try another room. Whew! I could sack out right here, no problem. Whoa! Careful, there. Oh, god, I hope it works. Hey, stop! It could be contaminated. Give me a break. [WATER RUNNING] If this is poisoned, give me more. [LAUGHS] [GASPS] Oh, shit. No use wasting it. Well, let's get us some chow, and that's all I'll ever need. Leave it to Jesse to find the latrine first. Hey, come on! More than three shakes, and you're whacking it. Hey! Mess hall's down here. Fucking great. Count us in! [THUNDER] [THUNDER] [TONE] [SCREAMS] [SILVERWARE CLATTERS] [PANTS] Shit. Come on, easy now. He can't hurt you. [GRUNTS] I move we sit right here, wait this damn war out. Don't move for a couple of 10 years or so. Let the suckers upstairs blow up from the radiation. I mean, we've got it made here. It sounds like a plan to me. I like it. What do you say? We'll see what happens. You got some bug in your butt about this place? That's right. So do I. You two want to go back out and fry in the rain? I just think we should keep our options open, that's all. Hey, we will check it out. We will just check it out. Well, I'll tell you one thing. This soldier is optioning herself into a hot shower for a couple hundred light years. I better go stand guard duty. What are you doing? Standing guard. No, you're not. 90% of household accidents happen in the bath. I'm standing guard. No, you're not. I'm not? No. You're going to come and soap my backside. What's the matter? Can't you handle it? I can handle anything. Well then, look alive, soldier. [TONE] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLICKING] [TONE] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLICKING] [TONE] [KEYBOARD KEYS CLICKING] [TONE] [BEEPING] Oh, you're a big help. [KISSING] [MOANING] Mm. Slow. Slow. [BREATHES HEAVILY] [BEEPING] You find anything yet? Not a lot. Well, you figure out what this place is? This thing's code crazy. [BEEP] But by the look of the lab and, uh, this-- [COMPUTER BEEPS] JAKE: What's that? Amino acids. JAKE: What? Amino acids. They're um-- they're building blocks for life. Those are the ones the human body can produce on its own. You know a lot about this stuff? I was a biochem major when they drafted me. Stuck me in a poison gas outfit. You were a gasser? [LAUGHS] Hey, it's not like I asked for it. They assigned me. [SIGHS] Anyway, we didn't get a chance to use the puking gas, not when the MIOBs came in. So I just ran. We all ran, didn't we? Did you get a fix on our location? We're 400 miles from New LA. If there's anything left closer, I couldn't get any indication. [BEEPING] You know, I can get an uplink on this. I think there might be something nearby. Don't do that. We're deserters, remember? So what the hell were they doing with these meanie acids, anyway? Amino acids. Whatever. What were they doing? Were they synthesizing them? Making them artificially? It's been done years ago. This is something else, something new. [COMPUTER BEEPS] Something important by the looks of this place. It's incredibly fortified and maybe not empty. What do you mean? Earlier I thought somebody was watching me. We could stay up all night telling ghost stories, but let's not. Come on, relax. This place is dead now, and it's ours. [BEEPING] [THUNDER] [TURNS ON COMPUTER] [TYPING] [BEEPS] [BEEPS] "October 13. It's gotten unbearable. The communication with New LA has been curtailed for some reason, nobody will tell me. I've been iced out of some major decisions, and it's getting ridiculous. The whole thing has turned from biomedical to social engineering. How many people can you cram into an enclosed space before somebody blows up?" [TYPING] [BEEPS] "October 15. I skipped a day. Bennet was snooping around the bookshelf. He must know something. He hasn't gone near the books in months. Had a weird thought. What if Bennet were drinking the stuff himself? Maybe he's sprinkling it in the food. Wouldn't put it past him, the weasel. It's a funny joke, ha, ha. But it creeped me out for half the morning. I shouldn't be putting this down, but sometimes I think writing this and the thought of someday going outside is the only thing that keeps me sane." [TYPING] [COMPUTER BEEPS] [BEEPS] [WHIMPERING SOUND] That's not right. Hm. [SNIFFS] Ugh. Shit. [GROWLING] [SCREAMS] [THUNDER] Mm, something smells good in here. Mm, that's delicious. It's all powdered, canned, and dehydrated. Well, you did something with it. Thank you. I'd better go get the others. [KNOCKS] Revelry, let's shag it! [KNOCKS] You awake in there? Sir, yes sir! [BREATHES HEAVILY] [SIGHS] [DOOR CLOSES] Jesse, get up. Breakfast is almost ready. Jesse? Jesse? Good morning. Hey, come on. Breakfast is ready. Damn. That shoulder still bothering you? Not as bad as yesterday. But you can bet it's still coming down out there. That acid was stronger than ever yesterday. So? So it means the war is still on. More acid, more megatons. It ain't over yet. It is for us, pal. It's all over. Now, come on. Let's get some breakfast. Aw, coffee. Man, I never thought I'd see coffee again. OK. So the way I figure it, we pull recon before we do anything else. Let's search the place thoroughly, see just what's what. And I'd like to work up a floor plan. That-- that might be on the computer. Good. Jess will do his looking on the computer while we're in the field. And I'd also like to work up an inventory of what we've got here. That may take some time. That might be programmed too. Great. Maybe they've got movies and stuff. Or a racquetball and Jacuzzi, maybe an intimate little disco tech? Slow down now. This place may not have all the comforts of civilization. Civilization doesn't have all the comforts of civilization anymore. That's just my point. We've got to be somewhere. And right now, this may just be the best place. It's good we stumbled on it. They obviously built it intending to stay awhile. Then why'd they leave? Maybe whatever they were doing was over, and they just left. You know how many government projects just get tossed? I mean, it's incredible. What makes you think this is government? Maybe it's not. That'd be even better. Unless it's military. Then we'd be in deep shit. The military never loses anything. No, we don't need any troops here. I move we make Kate permanent Mess Sergeant. No way, uh-uh. [LAUGHS] [LAUGHS] Jesse, come on, eat up. We need that brain of yours. Aren't we forgetting one thing? JAKE: What's that? BLANCA: That skull in the computer room. Jesse, what's wrong? [RETCHES] [SCREAMS] Jesse! Jesse! [WHIMPERS] [SCREAMS] Oh my god! Oh! Jesse. BUTCH: You think you can get anything out of that thing? There's codes within codes here. Jesse got through, he didn't leave a trace. BLANCA: It was the food. It was that food that killed him. No way. We all ate the food. And we're all going to fucking die. No. It was him. Something about him, not the food. His metabolism couldn't handle it. He changed, mutated. That does it. We're out of here. Come on, Butch. I mean it! I move we ace it right out the door! Yeah. Right into the acid rain bath. Oh, so we just sit here and wait for it to happen to us? No. We find out what this is, and kill it. OK. Well, start finding! First off, we've gotta know what kind of a place it is. It's a bomb shelter. I don't think so. Well, what then? I think we're in a containment vessel, designed to keep something in, not out. They built this to protect the outside from whatever they were doing in here. Oh, great. They were doing some dipshit science project, worried about some damn germ getting away. Meanwhile, the world's blowing itself to little pieces of rabbit shit outside. This is bullshit. KATE: Butch. God. Jesse said these were building blocks of something. Yeah, sort of. Well, he said whatever they were doing had to be new and important. KATE: Yeah. What? I think you're going to think I'm crazy. Go ahead. If they were experimenting with internal genetic synthesis of these, that would be quite a trick. If they solved it, it would mean the human body could make its own amino acids. We wouldn't depend on the food supply to provide them. Then what happened to Jesse? The mutation was complete. He didn't need food. In fact-- Overload. 10 tons of rocket fuel stuffed inside a hand grenade. Exactly. I'm on a diet right now. No more food. Not a bad idea. You think we're infected with this thing? If it's airborne, we must be. But we're breathing the same air as Jesse, and we're OK. Yeah, but he was such a little guy. Even so, I think something got to him to make it happen so fast. Something in there. I'll go in there find out. No! I'm going in there! Stop him, dammit! No. I'm the one to go. No. I'm the logical one. Nobody should go in there alone! It wouldn't help to stuff a regiment in there. I've got to do it alone. I've got to do it, Jake. No. I'm the one with the experience. I've got loads of experience. Yeah, in combat? That's right. He's two weeks out of boot camp, just like me. Fine! Go ahead. OK. Wish me luck. Don't, Jake, it's stupid. Look, maybe you can get your answer through that, but this is all the answers I ever had. KATE: Be careful! I will. See anything? Be quiet! He's going around the bend. Dammit! It's in this place. Do you hear anything? I can't stand this. This is bullshit. I'm going in after him. Butch, don't. He should have been back a long time ago! He hasn't been gone that long. Blanca's right. It just seems that long. I should've went with him in the first place. This is wrong, all wrong. We don't know what this is. We need ammo, weapons, explosives, firepower. There were rifles in the warehouse. You shouldn't go alone! [FOOTSTEPS RECEDING] Please, Jake, please. [SCREAMS] [BREATHES HEAVILY] [SCREAMS] [GROWLS] BLANCA: [SCREAMS] Dammit. BLANCA: [SCREAMS] [CRIES] [SCREAMS] [CRIES] [SCREAMS] Are you all right? No, I'm horrible! [SOBS] She's not going to hurt you. She's dead. Not that. It was some animal. It went through that vent. What was it? I don't know. It was-- A rat? No way was it a rat. It was six feet tall. [SOBS] I'm going in right now. Jake! Jake! Jake! Are you OK? Yeah. Oh, give me a second. What happened? Did it attack? No, not really. I don't think it wants to kill. Then what's it want to do? [THUNDER] [BEEPS] Now get the same samples from Jesse's body. OK. [BEEP] [TYPING] [BEEP] My god. That didn't take long. I didn't linger. Now, there's a room with empty cages near the sleeping quarters. I need something from whatever was in them, even a piece of fur or hair might do. Well, you can forget that. There's no lab rat I saw. Come on. Show me where you found. I haven't tested Jesse yet, but-- [TYPING] It's an incredible protein count. I'd say impossible. Jesse was probably healthier than all of us. I'd like to check those cages we saw. That you're wrong on. It wasn't a mutant test animal I saw. BLANCA: No way. You saw it too? Afraid so. Well, whatever it was, it was human, or at least started out that way. Wouldn't you say that? Yeah. And I don't think it wants to kill us. It doesn't? No. We need to tag-- [GLASS BREAKING] KATE: [GASPS] [GLASS BREAKING] Be careful. The generator! I'll get it. Butch! Stay here! Fuck. It's in here, I know it. OK. We cover that door. Nothing leaves. If Butch gets the lights on, blast the first thing you see. Somebody fucked with this. [MOTOR ENGAGING] [SQUEAKING] [CHOMPING] [SCREAMS] Butch! Oh! [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] Get it off me! [GROWLING] [LASER BEAM] Don't touch it. I want to check its protein. Fuck its protein. It's probably got too damn much anyway. How's your arm? Oh, it hurts like hell. Yeah, well, it serves you right. From now on, no more running off on your own. We all stick together. We might have had that thing cornered. We need water and something for a bandage. All right. We'll go to the living quarters. It's got water, and it's defensible. No more food, but nobody's eating anymore anyway. OK, let's go. Somebody better go at that generator. We start fucking gardening, we are dead meat. It'll pick us off one by one in its own sweet time. Now let's move it, people! Get him up. [THUNDER] That lock won't stop it, but it may give us some warning. OK, what now? We stay here. That's all. We can't do that forever. Why not? We're going to need food, for one thing. Do we? I don't know. Maybe not. I still say we should get out of here. Maybe the rain stopped. Listen. What do you hear? Sh. [THUNDER] Thunder. Right. Maybe we could rig something, some kind of umbrella. Lure the thing out in the rain and then zip back in. It's too smart for that. Then we rinse something and keep on going! Even if it worked, Jesse said New LA is 400 miles away. KATE: But there might be something closer. Jesse didn't seem to think so. If Jesse was so smart, how come he's dead? What about calling for help? Jesse did mention something about an uplink. We'll send out an SOS. You sure you want to do that? Why not? Because we're likely to run into the government. So we're AWOL. Big deal. I'd rather spend a couple of years in the stockade than get my head blown off! Not AWOL, desertion, man, from the field of battle. They could line us up against the wall. And get our heads blown. Maybe not. They need personnel desperately, especially at the front line. We still get our heads blown. This is ours. We stay here because we found it. Now, I say we kill anything that tries to push us out. Search and destroy? JAKE: You're damn right! I'm not sure we're up to it, Jake. Fucking monkeys. That's us. [SIGHS] OK. We'll try to make a phone call on the computer. Maybe we'll luck out again and find civilian help that doesn't ask any questions. Come on, Butch, let's go. Where are we going? To make the phone call. I should go. JAKE: No. Why not? You can't use the computer. I've had some training, enough for communications, anyway. Look, if this thing's as smart as I think it is, it's going to try and stop us. Butch and I can move the fastest and hit the hardest. Now let's move it, Butch. OK. Show me what you got. [BEEPS] [BEEP] [BEEP] [BEEP] [BEEP] I don't know only damn codes. [GROWLING] [SCREAMS] [GROWLS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [ROARS] [SCREAMS] [BUZZING AND HISSING] They should be back by now. It just seems like a long time. Didn't you say that? But how long do we wait? Stay here. That's what the man said, and that's what we're going to do. I feel like we let him down. Forget it. That kind of guy is never happy. Nothing's ever good enough. Hey, I know you're in love with the guy and everything. Yeah, maybe I am. What about you and Butch? Let's not turn this into a slumber party, OK? [LAUGHS] You know, it's not the dying I hate. Even when I ran from the front, it wasn't because I was afraid of dying. It's the rats, isn't it? There were a hell of a lot of them where I grew up. Think you'd get used to it, wouldn't you? Where are they? [CLATTERING] [WATER DRIPPING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [RAT PANTING HEAVILY] [SCREAMS] [RAT PANTING HEAVILY] Oh! [RAT SNIFFING] [WAILS] [RAT ROARS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMS] Where'd it go? [RAT HISSES] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] Kate! It hurts, Jake. It hurts. Where is Butch? Blanca, please! Where is Butch! I don't know. It's got him. Get a blanket. [GROANS] Now breathe in and breathe out. It'll just take a second. It'll just take a second. [BREATHES HEAVILY] Did you get help? Fuck that. I've gotta kill it. It's strong, and it's smart, but I've got to kill it. I've got to kill it. [GROWLING] [LIQUID SPRAYING] Butch! Butch! God. Are you all right? I'm fine. Hi, Jake. We've got to get you out of here. Maybe we should do that protein test on him. [COUGHING] [GURGLES] No! [RETCHES] [SCREAMS] BUTCH: [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [RETCHING] No! BLANCA: [SCREAMS] It's over. BLANCA: [CRIES] No! There's nothing we could have done. It's all over now. [GROWLS] [INAUDIBLE]. [SCREAMS] [GROWLS] Kate? Kate? Kate, are you all right? Well, wake up.
