He is my friend. I have always been betrayed by the people I love most. Like my mother... On the day my mother ran away, my father was shattered. Your father is useless. He is like a brush with no bristles. A fool who lives in the world of his colors... That is why your mother left me. What we had together was true love, you know? All women are selfish. Yes, they are selfish. On the day of our wedding... Your mother clasped my hand tight and told me she'll be with me forever. But... everything turned upside down in an instant... I thought of her as my world... But... Her world is different... There's no place for you and me there... Gautham... I have only you... You have only me... Please don't let go of me ever. I will always be there for you... Gautham... You are my world now. That night my father got drunk and told me that all women were selfish. From then on, I could never trust a woman. Son, has your mother not come? Shall I feed you? I have hands. I can eat on my own. Mind your own business! Gautham, why are you sitting there like a sad old man? Look at the others having fun. I won't play with them, Dad. Why not? Because they are all girls. So what? You are the one who said, women will abandon us midway. Hey... That was just drunken babble. That doesn't mean all women are bad. Despite his efforts, he couldn't convince me. I just couldn't forget my mother's betrayal. To get me out of my depression, my father brought me from Ooty to Chennai. Bye, Dad! - Bye, Son! OK, you sit down... Suganya... Yes, Miss. Excuse me! Come in... Why haven't you done your assignment? Sorry, Miss... You must finish it by tomorrow, OK? Hey Shri, the fat teacher is looking. Kneel down properly... My knees itch... mind your own business. Kids... This is Gautham. Hi. He's new. Gautham, you can talk to anyone in the class except these two. That was the point my life changed. Shri and Baby... It was an instant connection. Hey friend, the days are renewed... It is a waste if you don't have friends... Listen to me! Hey friend, the days are renewed... It is a waste if you don't have friends... Listen to me! Who was the grumpy teacher? Who was the beautiful one? We'd "rank" them accordingly... We graded them with enthusiasm... For our own Grades we didn't care, And on them we forged dad's signature all wrong... Hey friend, the days are renewed... It is a waste if you don't have friends... Listen to me! We'd get into fight sat street corners, Those wounds never hurt... But the second we depart, that hurt tears me apart... An age when naughtiness was sweet... Sweeter than sugarcane, Even mountains seemed like leaves flying in the wind... Hey friend, the days are renewed... It is a waste if you don't have friends... Listen to me! Listen to me! Friendship's "cool"... In our dreams, our thoughts and our hearts, It's Friendship... Friendship is fun, Friendship will destroy our worries too... We used to laugh till it hurt... We had so much fun... We used to bear hug each other till it hurt... We used to be so happy. Even if you hit me, or grab me angrily, You are still my friend... Even if I cry, or laugh in joy, You are my companion, buddy... Hey friend, the days are renewed... It is a waste if you don't have friends... Listen to me! Who was the grumpy teacher? Who was the beautiful one? We'd "rank" them accordingly... We graded them with enthusiasm... We graded them with enthusiasm... For our own Grades we didn't care, And on them we forged dad's signature all wrong... I don't understand why you are making me do this? Baby... Look there! Wow... Fantastic! Happy New Year, Bro! I love you, Bro! Just like jogging, this tea is healthy too... Cut... Baby, I've told you not to bring models from Bombay. Cut... Baby, I've told you not to bring models from Bombay. Cut... Baby, I've told you not to bring models from Bombay. They can neither speak Tamil nor act. There you go again!! Get lost! What are you doing there? Is your granny selling buns out there? Why is the make-up so bad? Ask them to change it! Couldn't you have done a better job? I am getting screamed at for your goof up. Sorry! That's OK... Are you free this evening? Can I give you my phone number? Please come back after the shoot... I am busy. Sir... Yes... I plan to leave at 5.10 pm I plan to leave at 5.10 pm. Come on... You've caused too much trouble. What, Sir? Please leave... Go away! Sir... Need a signature. Come on, Mr. Accountant... Come on, Mr. Accountant... How much did you steal today? We have our own Production House. We make a lot of TV commercials. This is France, this is London. We even used a Hot Air Balloon for our shoot in Germany. Shri is like a foreigner. He loves women. But mention marriage and he'll run a mile. How are you, darling? Good! Your friends are so very nice. But Baby is completely Indian. He loves his booze... But doesn't know when to stop... And this is what they do every day... Get drunk and curse each other using profanities... If anyone ever talks to us about love and marriage... Hey, draw the curtain! Ask him to... Shri, draw the curtain. What do I look like, buddy? Completely ugly! Roll over and sleep. Can someone shut the damn curtain? He's telling you! Chuck it, I will do it myself. Hey! My back... Everything will come out! He has legs of solid steel. You ruin my sleep every night! My sleep... My sleep is ruined... Look at his face... He looks like a half-dressed mouse. Have you mixed poison in this? No... Then why do you look like you want to murder someone? Go... You and your face! Where did your father find him? Bro, the engine is working now! Get going! You have won the Prize for the Best Artist... Congratulations. How does it feel? I don't paint with fame or fortune in mind. Hey! Did you think they are giving out freebies here? Finish up and come! Please don't talk... I am not able to! You know him better, Poor guy, give him a rub down. He's not ready yet. It's disgusting that I have to help him with this. Are all your paintings Black and White? Why don't you ever use other colors? My paintings do have color. Things that I have wished and yearned for, but have never happened, I paint in color. I live with those paintings. Look, Uncle is flirting with a woman so early in the day. Yes... And the girl looks like a hot bun! I'll buy you some jam, why don't you get done with breakfast! Shut up! My son's friends... She looks like Samantha Fox. She looks like unbent cycle spokes... And you call her Samantha Fox? One thing is clear... You won't even spare a man if he is in skirts. Sir... please keep quiet. This will pick up the sound. What will it pick up? The audio. Pick it up... He wants to "Pick up". Thank you, Sir. We are leaving. Oh... Your microphone. Hello... Enough! How come you boys are up so early...? It's only 10. We have an important meeting... Who's that girl, Uncle? She looks familiar... I got this award... Uncle... Please don't say anything! Why not? You remember the old lady who picks up trash in the street corner? â€“ Yes... He took her mobile number from her and sent her reminders to clean the road. Nothing's changed in these 15 years... Except one thing... I don't speak to my father anymore. Come on... let's go! Fire... Fire... It's very different... So funny... Well executed. Bra O... get it? Bra O... You guys are truly talented. I am going to give you a big commercial. If you deliver, there will be several more. Priya from my office will coordinate with you. One second... Darling, ask Priya to come in for a minute please? She's gone to see a client, Sunny. He's quite crazy... Priya will be with you for the whole project... and coordinate everything for you. Actually Sunny, do we need this girl at all? Why, is there a problem? No, Sir. Hey... don't call me "Sir". Call me Sunny. Ok, Sunny. - Good... OK. OK. Take Care. Thank you. Bye.- Bye. Baby... you look hot in the commercial. Take care... Bra O. Sunny made a pass so openly! Relax, Bro... He is a big shot. Compromise if you have to. Do you think of me as some "Item" for me to compromise??? He says he is going to send a girl. That's not going to work! Even if he does send a girl, please don't send ME to him. You know how they squash food to feed babies, don't you? He squashed my thigh like that... Bro, why don't you massage it for me? Hey, shut up... He has only women employees... Whoever he sends to us I will take care of! Hey, Bro... I think Sunny has a crush on you. Yes, next time we visit, see that you wear something more revealing. You are willing to use me just to get business??? Shut up! Can't a man have some peace in the toilet? Who is that... sounding so irritable? Useless fellow! Why are you sitting there like you own the place? Aren't you ashamed to peep? You're the one who should be ashamed! Sitting there like it's a library! And you have a water bottle on the side too... Do you have pop corn or nuts to munch as well? Hey Bro, look at this! There's a guy sitting here looking like a turtle taking a dump. Get down! Wait... I want to pour some water over his head, get me a mug of water! Bro! We'll pick up an orange juice and leave. But we are going to a party... Can't you have a drink there? Shall we party, If you are free this evening? Yeah... No problem. Excuse me... No babe, just some joker... No it's OK... Go on. Switch off all the lights in the shop please! Why? She pulled your fuse, but you're still burning bright! Don't worry, Bro... I'll get you a nice female mannequin. Hold on to it and walk around. You are getting desperate! Are you really standing here to pay the bill, or just to be close to that "Aunty"? You get the bill. Hey hold on! If you'd liked a better looking girl, I would have helped you myself. That one looks like a cardboard box drenched in the rain! How can you fall for her? Excuse me. Huh... What did you say? Are you talking to me or to someone on the phone? I'm talking to you, idiot! Me... An idiot??? Remove your make up and look in the mirror... You'll realize you look like the woman selling mangoes. Don't mess with me... Watch your tongue...! Your face looks like a chameleon with spikes! How dare you grab my shirt? If I slap you, your face will swell up. Get lost!! How dare you touch me? Do you know who I am? One thing is clear... If ever you get married, your husband will run away on the 1st night, that's for sure! You'll never get married! Hey... Cover her face with a basket and place a stone over it! Let's stay over tonight... You're on a roll! Why not? We meet these guys only once in 7 years... They only come if it's a party. The last time we did this was on our class trip! You're right! Tonight, let's drink till we sink... Definitely! Absolutely, Bro! The good times we've had at college... Those were the days! The good times we've had at college... Those were the days! Do you want another drink? Drink as much as you want... Since you are so tall, it will hit you only in the morning. Come on, guys... It's been so long... I am doing fine. How are you doing? You were the only one who resisted marriage... Now you've succumbed as well. You've come to party... go enjoy yourself... Hi Mike... How are you, buddy? I am fine, dude! Look at Mike's head. It's like an open playground... Hey! I am married, dude! How are you doing? We are fine... Only you look like a body that's washed ashore... What's happened to the "Six Packs" you had in college? I am married now... Gave it all to my wife! Baby... is that you? Yup... You look different... Did you sniff and make out it was me...? Shut up and drink! Hi, Senior! How are you? I am fine. How are you? Where's Baby? He's right here. Bro! - Hi Baby! Shall I order the drinks? Are you doing OK? I am doing well! How is married life? All OK? It's been just a year. My wife's already torturing me. She doesn't want babies. What do I do not to have babies? You have to do nothing! What? What do you mean "what"? Come on... You're married, right...? Go ahead and do it. Cheers... Cheers. Who's on the phone? Who is he "humming" to? My wife, Bro... She nags me. Why don't you say "Hmm" for me? We not only have to earn for them... but also have to listen politely to their nagging. She won't hang up if I tell her to. She will call me back and continue her nagging. But my girl isn't like that... I said "I love you" after a great deal of thought. Hmm? - Hmm! The heck you did... Look at him... Say "Hmm" man... Say "Hmm". Say "Hmm" man... Say "Hmm". You'll end up like him finally. A man has to be tough, bro! I am giving you free advice... Run away! Forget this, let's talk about something else. Don't listen to him. If there's any trouble, He'll vanish... What can I say? What more can I say? Words elude me... There's no peace... There's just no peace... Girls are a life-long pain... What can I say? What more can I say? Words elude me... There's no peace... There's just no peace... Girls are a life-long pain... She'll appear like a peacock, And give you a new high, If you get close to girls you will be destroyed... The ritual of the bride stepping on a stone... Why do you think they have it, bro? It's a rehearsal for her to stomp all over you... Keep that in mind, oh, yes!! She will make you dance to her whims, And control you completely... We tie the yellow thread around her neck, And get caught in that noose ourselves... What can I say? What more can I say? Words elude me... There's no peace There's just no peace... Girls are a life-long pain... Arumugam was a happy man, Now, he's bedridden with high blood pressure. A friend who's never touched Coffee or Tea... Now bathes in alcohol freely... Girls are a Fake, Their love is a Fake... It's just a simple wedding band... But with that you're distress bound... It's a torture, buddy, Marriage is as dark as night, If you're going to have fun being single, Then, whatever you say is right! What can I say? What more can I say? Words elude me... There's no peace... There's just no peace... Girls are a life-long pain... Oops... I am slurring! A single pillow is all I need, I can cuddle it and sleep... We can employ a Cook, To make everything we'd love to eat... To quench a little thirst, We don't need a full blown tragedy. Just to cross a small road, We don't need an airplane, buddy... Drink, get wasted, And go sleep it off in a corner... And if you want someone to talk to, Buy yourself a radio, buddy... What can I say? What more can I say? Words elude me... There's no peace... There's just no peace... Girls are a life-long pain... She'll appear like a peacock, And give you a new high, If you get close to girls you will be destroyed... To the host of this great Party, Narayanan! Wish you a happy married life. I have to leave! Why... what's the hurry? I have to drop my son at school in the morning. That's not it... his wife will fire him if he goes home late... She'll pick a fight with me. Fight back... Look... if I get angry... Just a minute... my wife's calling me. 15 minutes, darling... Look at that! Why are all of you living fake lives? All of you talk tough outside, but are scared of your wives... Why get married at all? You're right. We've seen so many like you... Those who protest the most get hooked first... Correct... Mr. Divorcee... If I ever say "I love you" to a girl, my mouth will become crooked. And if I do utter those words, it will be to Shri and Baby... I love you, dude! Are you saying you'll never marry? You will... As you grow older, you will... You'll fall in love, or have an "arranged wedding". But you WILL marry. Buddy... Marriage is like a public toilet... When you are outside, you'll want to get in... And once you are inside, you can't wait to get out. Anyone who understands this will never marry. They'll stay single like us. What dialogue! Mr. Divorcee, did you get that? Dude... let me speak... You mean you're going to be this way all your life? You are definitely going to get married one day... And you'll drift apart and only meet like this... once in a while... That's right... If marriage means no friends anymore, Then I don't want to marry at all. Right you are! Correct, dude! The 3 of us will never get married... We won't marry! Want to bet? Anyone wants to bet? Gautham, you don't believe in marriage because your mother ran away... Why are you dragging them into this...? Hey... how dare you say that? I'll thrash you! Hey... Let it be... Let him go... Why did you say that...? Hey... he's upset... Hey, buzz off...! Hey... Enough! Buzz off! Let it go... Don't take what he said seriously... Cheers! Why "Cheers"? Are we celebrating our friendship? What's wrong with you? What else would we celebrate? Oh, No... This is going to take a while. Bro... It will get warm, why don't we talk as we drink... When I think about it... it seems right! You keep chasing women! You'll get married, wont you? He doesn't spare even ladies' footwear... Don't take him seriously! Stop goading him. I may go around with many girls, but you know I won't make a commitment... You're just saying that! You are insulting me...! Don't you trust me? In this issue, I don't! Oh, No... this is going to go on and on... There goes our binge! Shut up man! Nothing is more important than our friendship... I promise... I won't marry till I die! We'll stay this way... You promise too... Why did you have to slash your wrist for that... What are you looking at...? From now on, you are my girlfriend. What are you waiting for? Please make a promise, before he butchers me completely... I promise... We will never get married... Ever! We'll stay single all our lives! I love you, dude.- I love you. Someone get the door! Baby... Check who it is... Who else could it be...? Last night you got drunk and beat up a cop, remember...? It must be them... When did I beat up a cop? Well, now that you are wide awake, please see who's at the door. Why are you carrying me? Beat him up... he's always hitting me... thrash him... The bell's still ringing. I'm not wearing anything inside... Please don't tear my nightgown... Oh, no... She's seen us! What are you saying, Sis... A night gown... Oh! No. There's more... There was another, wearing a wig, lipstick, smoking a cigarette. Oh, God! Did you go to an office or to the mental asylum? I called Sunny immediately. Who are these guys? Sunny's clients... The 3 are partners. Tell Sunny you won't go there... I can handle it. If I am able to handle this project alone, then I will get better opportunities. No... Better opportunities??? What about marriage then? Only if you get married can I get her married off too... I just told you what Mom would say... Mom, isn't that right? Hmm... Mam... cylinder! It's you! Got you... you wouldn't have opened the door otherwise... We have guests, please comeback later. Do you think I have come asking for a Tip on a festival day? Even your son won't visit you... Who has come? Shri... He's called several times... What are you up to? Let's go... My mother's brother, Somu has come from Madurai. He's come to invite us for his 1st daughter's wedding. They want me to marry his 2nd daughter... My mother is nagging me to talk to her. That's so easy for you... so, what's the problem? She bugs me! Really? Yeah! Son-in-law... Is that your friend? Who is this guy? He looks like pornography salesman. That is my Uncle... You go and spit on the girl's face... I will spit on his... Come soon. Son, what's your name? Baby! Huh? "Bethi"? (Diarrhea) Not that you old lady... "Baby"... Look at the names they have these days... In those days, they named my husband "Muniyandi" (South Indian name) They couldn't name him "Mukesh Ambani", could they? Were you named as soon as you were born? No... They named me just last year... What is that, Sis? Mint Chutney... When I was walking on the road, I saw something green... I picked it up from the ground, it was gooey... I even tasted it, it was very tangy... What was it? It was Buffalo Dung... Thank God, I didn't step on it... I'll say it one last time... What is it? You will not like me... That's OK... Son, what was the last commercial my son-in-law and you worked on? A Tea commercial. When's the next one? We're on the look out for the next victim... What? Come on, commercials are not dead bodies... When we get an offer, we will work on it... I am a flirt... I am a womanizer. That's OK. I am useless... the whole world spits on me... I am useless... the whole world spits on me... What I love is that, you've brought up your son, just like yourself... Shri... I can't take this anymore... Come. They are weirdoes... He is talking as if licking cow dung is something to be proud of... Remember the cardboard box we met at the supermarket? Yeah... She is Ashok's sister... Really? We are friends now... Are you going steady? I'd rather hit my head on the wall... Let go... Hey, Gautham. Uncle, Good morning. Come soon! Get started, he'll join us... This guy doesn't look like a cook, he looks like bristled brush... Ask him to shave, Uncle... Where were you? The next time you don't pick up the phone, I'll fix you... Why are you huffing like a pressure cooker? We met Somasundaram today... Shut up... Who's Somasundaram? Don't you know? That's his father-in-law... His granny and he are trying to convince him to get married. Don't be disrespectful. Shri... how is the girl? You can look at her once! Hey... This is not some movie. This is life... Uncle... he becomes my father-in-law, only if I get married... We have decided never to get married. I've tried to explain, but they refuse to listen. The other night, we got drunk, slashed our wrists and vowed that we'll be eternal bachelors. What kind of a foolish vow is that? Don't you need to settle down in life? Why are you getting upset...? We did it in jest... We were drunk...! What do you mean" in jest"? You've shown your true colors... You've made a "Blood Promise"! Remember that! There's no place for marriage in our lives... We are going to be this way forever... And if anyone breaks the promise and decides to marry... I will come to the wedding and kill you. If he comes and kills you at the wedding, he'll go to jail, you will go to heaven and I can live peacefully. Why don't you come in a tractor? You won't fit into the car. I told you so! Check if the car has a dent... I didn't want to hurt your dad's feelings... Why did you get so upset? Yeah... and vowing to kill us... Yeah... and vowing to kill us... Just drive on buddy, don't ram into anything. Priya will be waiting at the office. This is an extremely popular product in France. They are launching it in India next week. They are targeting girls between 15 and 25. Most girls that age believe in "love"... Including me... Only if the concept is attractive to girls, will the product be a hit. We have worked on a concept based on Love at first sight... Dream Sequence... Shall I proceed...? Go ahead... A girl and boy see each other... It's love at first sight... Is love conjunctivitis, to contract when eyes meet? Love is such a dated concept... It's like having Bagavathar (a yesteryear star)... acting in Basha (famous Rajni movie)... It is stale... This won't work... This concept has Sunny's approval. We'll talk to Sunny! Don't misunderstand... It is OK. They don't know what love is... They don't know what a woman wants, because they've never interacted with a woman. Wonder what he is telling her... What do you think? He must be bad-mouthing us... The way he's drooling, it looks like we have to swim out... Please wait... I will fight if I have to and convince them. Please don't... Can I ask you something, if it's all right...? Does Gautham not believe in love? He hates women... why would he believe in love ...? Why is that? They are gay... I'll kill him... That's why they don't like girls... Dunce! Come in... He's calling me... Please wait... Don't behave so badly! What were you telling her about us? Nothing at all... I was advising her... I told her the concept wasn't working and we needed a better one... Was that what you really talked about? Out with the truth! I promise... Grabbing his shirt is useless... The Gear-box is broken, now you need to push the car to start it... It is not going to work, Bro... Get out... Walk straight... Did they twist your arm? They didn't stop with that... How many power cuts will we have? Let it be, Mom. Stop complaining... What happened at the office today? The director is a Grump... 3 of them fight, and then make up the next minute... I have never seen such close friends. They do everything together. Karthik called. He's coming from the US. But, why did he call you? He said your phone was switched off... It's not that, this is the latest technique... Get the mother on your side and the daughter will follow... Shut up, pip-squeak! Till you agree to marry Karthik, she will continue this play-acting... What's wrong with him...? He's a green card holder, settled there. He knows you well... He is aware of our financial situation... Mom, he's just a friend. Please don't imagine anything else. It is important to marry someone you are in love with...? Why don't you like this concept? I have a better concept to make this campaign successful. Go on. Instead of love, let's base the concept on lust. In my opinion, the younger generation has become brand conscious. They want to dress well, impress others. It's never "Love" at first sight... This "Sublime love" is all fake, Sunny... I believe people only feel attraction. It's not love, just lust. Sunny, I think this is totally wrong. I think it is right... You are naughty! You are right, Gautham... Let's focus on lust instead of love. Priya, stay here, change the concept and then come... OK? By the way, Sonia's fashion show is at 7pm... All of you must come. I'll wait under the bridge at 6, will you "pick me up"? Don't wait under the bridge; a truck driver may pick you up then... We'll meet directly at the party. OK... Bye... Is he checking if I have shaved? You are the one who is pushing him to me... I'll kill you... Why did you trip me...? Are you mad at me? Not at all... Actually it doesn't matter what you think... Because, what I gave was the real picture... You know... it's being practical. You can't logically analyze everything in this world... Love cannot be explained... It has to be experienced. Your argument is totally wrong. He got my ear!! What the hell!! It is all because of you... you think it's a joke! Hey... Now who's the one flirting? Don't irritate me... What nonsense! Insisting love comes with a look and... Hey... don't talk loudly... She is waiting out there to help us... She may hear... Let her... I don't get it. I can't take it for 5 minutes, how are you able to flirt for 5 hours...? You think he's bad? His father takes a leak on the road just to check out the XXX film posters... Mock me all you want, but I have already made progress... There's a quiet romance going on between us... What is it "going" on - Petrol or diesel? When did this happen? We have been talking with our eyes the whole time. You won't get it... Why are you speaking with your eyes, is your mouth full? Excuse me, guys - She's here. Yes...? You guys seem busy... I'll leave. Wait... 2 minutes... I'll be right with you. You guys make your own lunch plans, I am going with her. She'll clean up after her meal, why are you going? Priya... Karthik... What a surprise... When did you come? This morning. By the way, this is Shri, Shri... Karthik. Hi, Shri... Karthik. Hi... I'm Baby... Hi... Hey... I am Gautham... Hi, Gautham... Are you from the US? How did you know? If you shake a girl's hand, you're from here... if you hug her, you're from abroad... We've seen it in so many Tamil movies. You said you wanted to eat. Finish and join us... Careful... it's two plates now... See you, guys... Hey... I am coming too... Shall we leave?- Sure... Hello... Control room. Pull over, pull over. Cops... Stop... We must respect the law... It is only 8... they are checking already?! Lower your window... Where are you coming from? It's late... won't your family be looking for you? Do you have papers? Didn't you read them in the morning? Don't act too smart... Have you been drinking...? Blow... Why are you coming so close, like it's a kissing scene in an English movie? Stop laughing! Get down from the car... Why should we get off...? We know the law... The rules say the Driver should not drink... But he's drunk... He's not the driver... He's the owner... The Driver's gone on a pilgrimage... Wait here! Don't act smart... Those guys think they are too smart... Listen, Sunny's called a 100 times! We're late for the launch party. Let's leave. Hey... if we pay up, they'll let us go... Why waste it...? Let's go... There are 3 guys in an Audi car... Catch them. Where are those guys, Shri, Gautham and Baby? No idea... I told you we should have paid up... And now we have to go through this... You guys never listen... We'll listen when you finish speaking. Stop whining like a woman whose son is writing his board exams... Look at that guy... He's sprawled like a discarded tin... He won't surface for a week. Don't they look like terrorists? These guys? Yeah! Those guys are making fun of us! They look like beggars outs idea public toilet... Just look at his face. Hey... what's with you... you look like rich kids... Look at you! Anyone will look like a rich kid standing next to all of you... Wait... I'll talk to the local Councilor and ask him to get us out. Hey... whom are you calling? Give me the phone! Sis... Brother... I am calling the Councilor. He has no luck with phones. Sir... Just one phone call... please... Sir... You've arrested the future super star of Tamil Nadu... There is going to be chaos. We can't be held responsible for that, OK? Hey, fat face... You're getting frantic... who's the future super star...? Don't you know him? Nope! He is a politician's son. His name is Current... He was listening to a story in a Bar and there was a raid... He is a big actor! Oh... he's one of those, who listen to scripts between sips... How dare they lay a finger on "Current"? The power shut down is between 10.30 and 12... that's how they had the guts to touch you... You called him an actor...? He looks like someone who drives a Tractor... It is a shame! Are you telling me he's never been insulted before? Don't stress yourself, Bro... I have used my brains and brought you something... to tide over this situation... Place it there! Oh! My God! You have the gall to bring liquor into the Police Station... You guys are dangerous... By the way, who are those guys? They look like people who make spurious liquor... They got themselves arrested to narrate a story to him. Wow... What martyrs!!! I have a story as good as "The Titanic". Remember, the old lady throws the chain into the sea...? You are the Indian officer who finds it... Whether it is found or not, forms the climax. Wow! You look like a thief who snatches chains from old ladies, how dare you make a film about a chain? Get out... get out... Hey not out... get in... inside... What's happening? They make porn movies... Just questioning them... Thank you, Sir... Where has he gone? You think the cops are thrashing him? Hey... Are you such a great actor??? I am acting in two films. He's the director... Him??? He looks like a sparrow's droppings... He looks like he's dressed up for a fancy-dress competition... Director, how do you contribute? I have created a new art form just for him... A mix of Kathakali (an Indian dance form) and Karate. A mix? Did you pour soda? What? Nothing. Continue... Shall I show you a sample of the "art form"? A sample? Is he selling clothes I wonder! Yeah, show me! Is this a police station or a mental asylum? Hey... get up... You think policemen are fools? Sir, the place is filled with lunatics. Sir, the place is full of them... Come and see... Guys... check this out... It is so funny. What do you think of yourselves...? You are going to give our country a bad name... But India is a good name, Sir... But India is a good name, Sir... Mocking me...? I'll tear you to shreds... Call home... Give me the number, Sir... Call your house! Dude, call home... Head constable... Yes, Sir... Give them the phone. Let them call home... and get someone to come. Yes, Sir... I can't come to the police station! Put the phone down. My father won't come. We'd better call Uncle... Call, buddy... Who's Uncle... No... No need... You call, Bro... You don't need to talk... Keep quiet... If you call...!!! If you don't, then I will... Why do you have to call him? Whom else can we call...? Hey... Idiot!! Do you want tea? Here... Mom... there's a guy who's pouring tea from the roof... I want to kill that Fly. Fool... You would have broken the table. Hey, Bro... the Fly is teasing him... That's not a Fly... that's his grandfather who died of diabetes. He's come as a Fly to haunt him. Why are you getting irritated? Shall we irritate the Fly and make it go mad...? Yeah... Come on... When the Fly rests, 3 of us should scream at the same time... Aah!!! Not now... after it sits... It may know what we are up to. Act like you don't care and look elsewhere. One... Two... Three... What happened, Priya? This fly reminded me of what those guys at office did... Oh... Too funny! Priya... You have to come out for dinner with me this evening. Why dinner? I am going back to the US in a couple of days. Need to discuss something important... I can't make it this evening, Karthik... I am so sorry... There's a birthday party I promised I would attend... One... Action... It's my Bro, Baby's birthday today... Happy Birthday! Thank you! He's getting a gift... Why are there so many candles, like it's the church? Here, Uncle... Have some, Bro... She is the coordinator of one of our projects. Please come... Her name is Priya. Don't punch me... Come on, I've bought booze and chicken, let's go. OK... How can we go when we have a guest? I don't think she drinks... ask her to come along if she wants... Bro... will you do something for me? I'll do anything for you ...Tell me... Talk to your Dad... You could have asked me to die instead... Hey! Uncle... you don't worry, we are going to have a drink with you... Let him join us if he wants. Yes, Uncle... I'll leave... Have a small drink... No! No... Sure? I am sure... See you! Uncle, let's get smashed tonight... Come on! Yes, Uncle... Have at least one drink with us... Come on... "When the breeze touches us, what is the color in the heart...?" "When booze is poured, what is the color of the glass...?" Hey... Cheers, Uncle...!! But... Don't laugh too loudly... If he hears, he won't talk to you for a hundred years... A hundred years... Did you hear what he said? He said he'd rather die than talk to me... What did I do to deserve this? What sin did I commit that he won't talk to me? I'll die... He said he'd die... I'll die... I'll die... Let me go... Why are you like this? Like what? For so many years, your father has taken care of us like his own sons... He loves you so much... How can you not talk to him for so many years? Why so much ego? What's wrong with you? My high has vanished... Why are you crying like those women on television? You know I don't like tears, don't you! Hey Baby... just look at him... Crying like a chick... You don't have to be a chick to cry... Anyone who is born human, cries. Really...? OK... I am not human...! Go to sleep... Stop weeping in the middle of the night! Ok, Lights on! Go in... Bro, the shoot is happening inside... Why are you checking the light here? Who's that? Don't know... Looks like a nightingale disguised as a sparrow. Yes Sonia, It's about 400 feet from the vanity van to the Shooting floor. You can reach within 3 minutes and 2 seconds. You can reach the floor from the car-park in 7 seconds... There's a 4 by 4 door, and once you enter, it's all very confusing. Hey... Step back... Who are you? You look like a thief who steals shoes at shoots... Was that how you got yours...? Come on... I am Sonia's manager. Then why are you walking around like a rag picker? Whatever I do, I plan well... If you talk too much, your face will contort... Who's Baby here? Oh... YOU... I thought it'll be a chick... It's OK! Please organize Sonia's lunch... She'll eat at the subway... There'll be beggars in the subway... Ask her to eat in the Vanity Van. Hey I meant the "Subway" restaurant... Salads and Subways... Oh! OK... Oh! OK... Hey, tall man... Will the bathroom in the Vanity Van have water...? Did you expect it to have tomato juice? Hey, you local, unprofessional boy... Talk to a Manager with respect... I'll talk to Sunny... Hey... when do I start rolling...? Who is this, he looks like a Mouse? Does he look that good? He's Sonia's manager. She'll arrive only when he tells her to. Yeah! She is waiting for my call. What is this...? It's 11am already. Hello, Bro... Do you think Sonia's a puppy to come whenever you call out...? She is a busy international model. The set isn't ready, there's no water in the vanity van, the camera is not ready, the film hasn't arrived!! Welcome, Sonia. He keeps slapping everyone! Absolutely not... yeah. Hi, Sonia! Look, Priya... I agreed to this commercial only because of Sunny... I don't even know these people... The shoot hasn't even started and there's so much confusion... Hey! Switch on the microphone... She is not acting for free... We've paid her what she asked for. Does she expect me to welcome her with flowers... when she comes at 11am for a 9am call-sheet? She may be a big shot... But this is my shoot And I call the shots! Sonia... No one's ever spoken to you like that...! Hey!!! Apple Juice! Switch on the lights, man!!! Are we ready for a "take" or not? Don't you have something smaller??? Bring that...! What's he doing? Without make-up, she'll look awful... Huh... OK... We can go for a "take"... Ready... ready... OK. OK... More sensuous! More Sensuous!! Shucks... Cut... Baby... Order an 8 layer sandwich, Baby... Order an 8 layer sandwich, one and half pastas, and a 32inch pizza for Sonia's lunch. 32 inches? Is it a TV or what? I thought she'll eat like a model not a cow... Don't talk too much. Order the food! Ok... it will be here! Who is this guy? He's really arrogant... Hmm... Tell me! That's the way he is. No one's ever shouted at me. He's the first! Let's shoot without a break... Most directors only flirt with me even when I am late... This guy's very different. Stop torturing me! How can we finish by the evening? In a couple of days, he will be running after me... Sunny... we'll wrap only by 10pm. That's the best I can do! Whatever the reason, he shouldn't have screamed like that! He hates women... I am really sorry! Why should you apologize...? It's not your fault. I haven't taken it amiss either... It was a new experience... I liked it...! I like him! Priya, the actor can come! I am the sea, my waves never cease... I am the flame, I burn incessantly... I have no companion... My womanhood refuses to sleep... It is true, I lose sleep... My eyes search for you... I am the sea, my waves never cease... I am the flame, I burn incessantly... I have no companion... My womanhood refuses to sleep... It is true, I lose sleep... My eyes search for you... Come! Write love poems... With your lips on me till dawn... My whole body will have lyrics of your songs... The first time I saw you, I opened my heart's doors... My body and soul belong to you... I've written a Will saying that and died... My friend, if you place your lips on mine... I will come back to life... My love, if you let go when I embrace you, Then again I shall die... My lord, from now on... My lap shall be a pillow for you to rest... As you sleep, my bangles clinking softly, Turns into music... Here and there, The female bird will spread it swings over you... Oh, my! The chill I feel and the chill you feel, Will disappear in seconds... I am the sea, my waves never cease... I am the flame, I burn incessantly... I have no companion... My womanhood refuses to sleep... It is true, I lose sleep... My eyes search for you... All right... Shot ok! Good job, Sonia! Great job, Sonia! Sonia... Thank you! OK, Bro... OK. Thank you. Oh, no...!!! Hey... No! You had the guts to slap Sonia??? Oh, God! Gautham, what you did was horrible! Sorry... Wait... I don't want any excuses! She's a top model! In front of everyone you've... So what if she's atop model?? Sunny... This isn't Gautham's fault, it's Sonia's! I know it! Priya, you have nothing to do with this... What are you saying? Mind your own business! Don't interfere! You work for me and you are supporting him??? It doesn't matter whom I work for. The truth is more important! Don't teach me what's right! I am your boss! Look everybody... I have... Whatever be the case, it's wrong to slap a woman. You can forget Sonia now! She'll never work with you... ever! And, please don't step into my office! God!!! Country brutes! Hey! Was that necessary? She bit my ear! OK... where's my watch? Did I give it to you? It's a wrap! Hey... come here! This doesn't work... You can keep it! Get lost! What happened? I just started on a drink and you've wrapped... I think it may be better to open an Emu Farm than do this! Buy some land and... Hello? Hello! I got a message from this number... Who is it? This is Priya. Don't worry, Gautham... It wasn't your fault... I will talk to Sunny and... Hello... Priya... Bro! What happened? Something's happened to Priya... Get into the car! Are you related to her? We are her friends... How is she now? Nothing to worry! She's lost a lot of blood... She needs blood urgently! It'll take time to get here from the Blood Bank... O Positive... Hey, aren't you O positive? No I am not... His blood group... Come on. Nothing to be afraid of... It'll take 5 minutes... Doctor... O Positive has become Vodka positive... I've had a drink... Only riff-raffs drink... I am sure your liver is damaged. You must be having ulcers. I don't doctor... I have another problem though! What is it? When I hold my wrap-around between my teeth to take off my pants, I feel like yawning... Is there any medication to stop that? Stupid! Why are you giggling? Go in!! He's acting like he bought me a drink! Get away... stop leaning on me! Mom... here... Priya... Find out who they are? We brought her to the hospital... What happened? It's nothing, Aunty. She got hurt on the head. They've kept her in the ICU... Oh, God! The ICU? Nothing to panic... We spoke to her just now. The Doctor said there's no problem. She's fine. Who's come with Priya? I have... Please pay this bill immediately! 80,000...? Why so much? How is she now? Madam... we just work here... Please clear your queries with the doctor... We have to wait for the Test results... Please pay the bill immediately. Excuse me... Let's pay the bill... Tell her... Let's pay it, Bro! Please don't cry, mom... What do we do? Let's ask the neighbors... Go, Bro! Mam, Give it to me... We'll pay it... Bro, make the payment! No... there's no problem... Just take care of her. Call me if you need anything else... We'll leave! Bro... Bro... What is it? Nothing... She'll survive, won't she? Get her a good job in the US, she'll survive! Am I in charge of the ICU...? Why ask me? She was talking to me when the accident happened... I am worried... She would have fallen anyway... Girls drive rashly these days... Everything will be OK... Go to sleep! Are you scared it may be considered a murder? You've decided she won't make it? If that happens, they'll keep you in prison for 8 years and beat you up!!! It's the hospital...! If it's the hospital, then it's certain. She's dead! Yes... Shut up and pick up the phone! I won't be able to take it... You talk... Is this a call-in show or what...? You talk... Give it to me... Hello... Hello... Hello... The doctor said there's nothing to worry about... She can leave in a week's time. My mom asked me to inform you! Oh, Ok... Nothing to worry, is there? She's out of the ICU... Huh? Hello? Nothing... Tell me... We'll come there at 10 am tomorrow. Tell her we'll get her apples and oranges... OK... OK... She's hot! He's so tall, he can bend forward and look at a girl in front. What can we do? He will make even an ordinary girl sound extraordinary... You go ahead, I'll join you! Don't stay back, because the nurses look good! Be back soon... He's not bothered that it's a hospital... Please come... Priya... Hello... don't get up... how are you feeling now? Much better. Please wait, I'll be back... I prayed for you, you know! He went this way. Call him... He'll be back... Wait a second... Tell me... Sir... How do I reach the neurology ward? Don't ask me... Bro... Something's come up... You leave... I'll join you later... I'll come too. It's nothing... just a small issue... I'll join you, you get going! Hey... That day my friends left without telling me... where they were going... That was the last day the 3 of us were together. Shri and Baby went out of town saying they had important work... Didn't they tell you? They'd never gone anywhere without me... They'd left me alone and gone out of town... This was the 1st time... I couldn't take it! You tell him... Bro... Don't say anything... I am cheesed off! I need to discuss something important... Instead of giving lame excuses, better not to say anything. You go if you want... Why do you drag him along? Where did you go anyway? Did I say I won't come? Yes... You wouldn't have come, and wouldn't have let us go! Baby... What is he saying? Hey... Tell him! Bro! We are getting married! Hey... You'll raise a lot of eyebrows! We have a lot of work to do. We need to finish the edit. Let's go! Bro... Yeah? He's serious! We've decided to marry... Yes... I am marrying my Uncle's daughter, Parvi... And... I don't know if you remember the girl from the Super-Market... Baby is marrying that girl... Bro... Till today... We've done everything together... If you're OK, we can find a nice girl for you and get you married... I'll slipper you! If you are playing the fool, stop right now! We are not playing the fool... We are serious. If I am important to you, then come to the office with me right now! Sorry, Bro! Our lives are more important to us... Please understand... You've shown me you're scum! Let him get lost if he wants to, where are your brains? Are your lives more important than our friendship? If you ever step in here calling yourselves friends... Get out! Get out! Hey... Baby... Shri... Draw the curtain! I forget the world in my loneliness... All my life, I've only talked about you... It pierces my heart... My life hurts... We counted only on each other... Will that friendship ever come back? I forget the world in my loneliness... All my life, I've only talked about you... It pierces my heart... My life hurts... We counted only on each other... Will that friendship ever come back? We had scores of fun... We laughed at our snores... We wandered around freely... Now we've split halfway suddenly... Like shadows in the night... I've lost two friends, what a plight! If one cries in the rain, it goes unnoticed. The tears are shed in vain... His story continues far away... His eyes are riddles, nothing they give away... From now on I am alone man... Is friendship just an act? We lived for each other, We were born anew everyday... Now we've split indifferent directions... Got lost in the jungle called marriage... The dew drop belongs with the flower... Our bonds are only with a few... How can friendship ever end? Can't forget that you'd said that, my friend... I try to forget, but I cannot... I shed tears, yet, see no shore... I existed because of you, And for you, my existence shall continue... One day Friendship will reunite us... I forget the world in my loneliness... All my life, I've only talked about you... It pierces my heart... My life hurts... My life hurts... We counted only on each other... Will that friendship ever come back? All the best! Please bless us. Take your parent's blessings first-That's what we're doing. God bless you! Where do you need to go? I am going to Gautham's office, Uncle... Shall I give you a ride? Sure... Come... OK. Couldn't Gautham make it? How would he? He's fought with them. He won't come. Why is Gautham like this, Uncle? I am the reason. Gautham stopped trusting women ever since his mother left home. I re-married, hoping that would change things for him. Gautham didn't like that. Give it to me, Gautham. Dad... What is it, Gautham? I have told you so many times, I don't want a mother. Will you never learn? Hey... I don't like you... Get lost! Please listen, son... Don't talk to me... Take this... I don't want it... I don't want to cause a rift between both of you. I am leaving. Gautham didn't forgive me even after that... I've tried so hard. He still refuses to talk to me. But by God's grace, he had wonderful friends... He was very happy with them. That was some relief. Now, he's fought with them too... I went to the wedding. You weren't there. Why should I go there? I don't mean to pry. But they are your close friends. You should have come... The wedding... The problem was the wedding itself. I'd told them that they'd get married and settle down. But they said they'll be with me forever, that our friendship will last forever. They're gone... I understand. You won't understand. We've been together since we were kids. I am not used to being alone, you know? So what if they are married? You live in the same city. You can still be friends the same way. The moment they said their lives were more important... I threw them out of my life... I haven't spoken to my father in 20 years. I haven't forgiven him. Who the heck are these?! Please leave, Priya... I just want to be alone. Please leave. Hi, Karthik... Hi, Karthik... Hi! Give me a minute. I'll be back... OK. Did you call her? Why are you so late? Poor Karthik has been waiting for a while. How long could I keep him entertained? Poor Gautham... He's all alone... We'll discuss that later... Go, talk to Karthik... Did you give him anything to drink...? Already done that! Hi... Hey don't go out of the way, Priya... No, I am fine... Your mother said you'd gone to a wedding. I thought I'd wait for you and... I called from the US... Your mom picked up... I spoke to your mother about it... I am very sorry... No problem, Uncle... Baby? Yeah... If I die, will you build a Taj Mahal for me? I've even found a place, sweetie... The moment you die, I'll start work on it... I have told you not to pinch my waist in front of the others... Make him understand, Madam... I'm sick and tired of telling him. My son-in-law is like me! You like the mid-riff, do you...? That's my weakness too... How long do I have to wait? Where are you? Remember, you liked a diamond necklace at a jewelry shop the other day? Yes... I told you I'd buy it later... Yes... yes... The Red Diamond... NAC Jewelers... Right? Yes... I am right opposite that shop. Having a drink... What is it, darling? Hi Paru... Who is Rosy? That's my friend's dog... That dog called this morning! Bro... Bro... Why are you so late? My wife insists that I should not go out in the evenings. Forget that. How are you? I am so-so! She nags me all the time... She made me promise I won't drink! More than that she says... Am I important... or are your friends important? It's the same story... You've become a "family-man"... Oh! Yes, Bro... She can match the saree she's wearing with the fabric that's at the store. But we can't remember even the pants we wore in the morning. Yes... it's the same at home. I have to be back in an hour... Pour the drink. Quick... Wait...! Give it to me... What is it? This is for that dog! Shall we try calling him? Don't you know what a toughie he is? He'll never pick up our calls. Poor guy... he must be struggling without us... Let's meet him in the morning... Cheers! Hey... My wife's calling me... I'd better leave... This drink...? If anyone catches me for drunken driving, I'll give it to them... See you later... Take care... Bye... Good night. Bye... Hey... Hi. Hi... Sunny asked me to give this to you. What for? The commercial's a big hit... The clients are really happy... Oh... That's good news. Sunny is not angry, is he? It's nothing like that. He's asked you to meet him at the office later. OK... I wanted to tell you the other day... But you were upset and I didn't bring it up... What is it? Thanks for helping me during the accident... Oh... it's ok! We don't say such things between guys. What things? "Sorry"... "Thanks"...all this stuff... Not even when you fight? Yeah... even when we fight, we never apologize... We just start talking again... Hey... Who's switched off the merry-go-round? Hi, Priya... Hi... Heard the Commercial is a big hit... Yeah! They are running the commercial on TV... as many times as a diabetic uses the toilet... Will that cartoon Sunny give us the next commercial as promised? Definitely! Excuse me, Sir. Priya, ask them to leave! Enough... Why are you making a fuss? He'll pull a long face, but once we make up, he'll gush... Just ask these guys to get out! I want to be alone! Oh, God! He's really angry with us. He talks in English only when he is this angry. Don't tease him. Don't tease him. It's been very long since we caught up. Bro... Order some booze and bucket chicken. Priya, please leave... He's going to curse us real bad now and you'll be embarrassed. Please go. Yes... You can make a tape out of his profanities... it'll be really bad... Please leave... Go... Priya, please wait. You carry on... I won't say another word... Ask them to get out before I thrash them... Hey... Let's go! Why should we leave? We are partners in this company... We've put in 2 million each... We won't stay quiet if he hits us. Tell them I'll return the money in a month. Ask them to leave now... I won't come back even if you want me to. Take your ego and dump it in the trash can... You won't realize this now. But you'll never get friends like us ever! Priya... please leave. Yeah! Hi, Gautham... Good morning. Hi! Good morning. Someone wants to talk to you... One minute... Hello... Talk to me first... then you can talk to Priya. Sonia? I knew you wouldn't forget my voice! Anyway, heard our commercial is a big hit. Priya said we should work together again... I have no issues. Will "Director Sir" work with me? Yeah! Sure! That's great! Why not? Sure... Priya's the one who got really worried. Anyway, you let me know... Take care. Yeah! Take care. Thanks a lot... Don't thank me! Thank Priya. Friends don't say thank you to each other... You can't change the concept this time. It's all about love. Love... Yeah! No worries. We'll do it. We need to present the concept to the clients in a couple of days... Get the details from Priya. Yeah! Sure... The setting is a college cultural fest. Boys and girls dance wearing masks. Boys and girls dance wearing masks. Suddenly, a girl's mask shifts a bit. The boy looks at her beauty and is mesmerized. God!!! A puppy gets stuck in between traffic. A girl gets off the car and rushes to the pup. A boy rushes from the opposite side. They lift the puppy together. You mean... They fall in love, because of a puppy?? Yeah. Why...? Is that not possible? A boy walks out of a crowd. And from the opposite direction, a girl walks towards him. Their eyes meet. Gautham, you'd better decide... Do you want this commercial or not? What do we do? I'll present the concept to the client and get an "OKAY". All you need to do is, direct it... It seems good. We'll take this forward? Not bad, Priya... You spoke in English, confused them and made them buy an empty concept... I gave it everything... I expected you to say "thanks"... Thanks so much... I could never have thought of such a boring concept. Gautham...! I told you so!!!!!!!! I told you!!! Be happy! It's not what you... Be happy... Wait... I'll explain. Don't forget to send mean Invite. Who is he? Just ignore him. He's a friend... we were in college together. At a friend's bachelors' party, we made a bet, that we would never get married... Shri and Baby are married now... And he's seen me with you... He's made his own assumptions... He thinks... So... you'll never marry? No chance. If you fall in love and get married, you can be happy... I don't believe in love... how can I get married? Love is like the breeze... Even if you can't see it, you can feel it... Pray that you don't fall in love... Because the things you're thinking... this illogical magic, it won't happen even when you're an old woman... I will definitely fall in love and marry. And it will happen, just the way I believe it will... Shall we leave? Done... How did this ad... Hi, sweetheart... Whom are you waving to? Who is she? Will you never learn? I'll kill you! Go away! It's OK... Come... The dog at my parent's place died. My mother couldn't digest it at all... Who asked your mother to eat a dead dog? Sweetheart... Eat... Why is she barking? Oh! Priya... Hello, Uncle... Come in... Sit down... It's OK, uncle... It's time for our flight... Oh! Hmm... where is he going? We are shooting a commercial in Europe... Oh... Are you going along? Yes... Sonia, Sunny, Gautham... me... We'll be away for a week. Priya... I'll be right with you. Priya... Could you do mea favor...? Tell me, Uncle... I'm not even sure he has my number... Once you reach, could you give me call? Don't worry, Uncle... I will take care of it. OK... Bye, Uncle... Bye... Has Sunny reached? He must have... If he's got the boarding pass, he should go in... why wait? How can one be a "director" if one can't be punctual? Oh, he's come... Hi! How are you? I've been good... Hi, Sunny Sonia... Meet Mr. Gautham. Gautham... Sonia. You look familiar... Come on, it's late... let's go! He seems in a mighty rush! Let's go. Come on... come on! How arrogant! She claims I am "familiar". Sunny, order 2 buckets of hot water for me... Get lost! Your keys... I am going to the restaurant. Join me and we can plan the shoot... Two minutes... I'll go to the room and then join you. Oh! Wow... What snow! Need to take pictures and send them home... I am hungry too... Mind if I join you? Yeah, sure why not! OK... Life is strange, isn't it? I never thought you and I would be in Switzerland together...? Yeah... true... What do you understand from this? Destiny has brought us together... I don't believe in such things... Sonia... They are already calling you "open" and "easy" on Facebook and Twitter... If you don't slow down, they'll call you worse things. Shut up, TJ... Gautham and I are discussing life... Just leave us alone. My God! It's getting too hot out here... Hey, Priya... pull up a chair... It's OK... No... I don't want to disturb you... I'll come later... No problem... No... it's OK. Why? Is it difficult being alone with me? No, it's nothing like that... Priya and I were planning to meet a few technicians for the shoot. What is it, Priya? Nothing... just... Come with me. Just pack this... for her. Of course! Come! Here... Thank you. Wear it now. What...? Nothing... Come. It's OK, right? Do you want shoes as well? I just forgot! Watch? Thanks. Let it be with you... I keep forgetting... I am very forgetful... OK... Let's roll... ready! Priya... Get Sonia. Yeah, Gautham! Hurry, please! OK. Sunny... do you have a smoke? Sonia... Shot ready! This isn't the dress, is it? What is it, Priya? Is there a problem? That depends on him. Can you please call him? OK... Sure. Let's finish the Jip Shot first. Gautham, Sonia wants to talk to you in private. She's calling you to the Vanity van. Why... what's the problem? Just go! Just two minutes... I'll come. Hey, Sonia... what happened? I don't know... The shoot, the vanity van... they are reminding me of what I wanted to forget... What are you saying? Remember, you humiliated me in front of everyone? Sonia... It wasn't my fault... I slapped you because of what you did. I don't know, Gautham. It is bothering me. No one has ever humiliated me... That's over and done with... Why think about it now... OK... OK, right... let's just be professionals and let's do this. Great! Change into your costume and let's start rolling... OK... Before that, you need to apologize... I told you. It wasn't my fault. Why should I apologize? You have to... And, if I don't??? Why wouldn't you apologize...? You will say "sorry"...! Or else I'll leave. The shoot will stop... And no one will ever trust you with another commercial. Are you threatening me? You think you're scaring me? Who are you to say it...? I will say it myself... I will not shoot this commercial with you! Priya... Tell Sunny we've wrapped! Relax, Gautham. What happened? What do you think...? Ask her yourself! Sonia... Sonia, please wait! How come no one is talking to him...? If he can have such a big ego, so can I... I don't care! I am leaving! Sonia, what happened? Sunny, you can sue me if you want... But I will not work with such an egoistic director! Sonia, wait! Sir... this is all because of me... Shut up, Priya... Please go... I will talk to him... Gautham... why are you doing this? Please come and apologize to her... Come... Haven't you left yet??? Sonia... Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait for 5 minutes. I am sorry, Sunny... I can't stay back after this... Sort it out with your Director. I'll take care of it, Sonia... There won't be any more trouble... Please wait... Listen to me... Oh, No... She's ditched me... I'll have to fall at their feet to get back home... Gautham... Priya... You... You said "no"...I was the one who... Stop crying... What do you lose by saying you're sorry? Disgusting, Man! What do I tell the clients...? Gautham... Talk to me!!! I am screaming like a lunatic, and you're just keeping mum! It's such a big project... Look at this. Do you know how much I'll lose...? You've shown your true colors, haven't you...? And to think I wanted to help you! I should slipper myself... She conquered me! Wove my soul onto hers... Will I ever live happily? Unfaltering, Without toppling to the ground, Will I ever redeem myself fully? In the corner of her lips, a smile blossomed... And my sins were absolved... From the pouring rain, Without getting wet, I try to get away... As I walk, the floor moves too, I struggle with each step! The eyes are at fault, curtains come down... That is why I am in a daze... Oh, just like yesterday, The sky is still blue today... My days are lengthened... My feet want to move away, They refuse to listen tome... I am a bird, You are my wings... I want to conquer the wind! I am the journey... And you are the path... I wish to break borders and go! She conquered me! Wove my soul onto hers... Will I ever live happily? Unfaltering, Without toppling to the ground, Without toppling to the ground, Will I ever redeem myself fully? Gautham... Hi... Haven't you eaten? I was waiting for you... When the evening arrives, My body burns up, It becomes like a red hot lily... When the wind crashes into me, I think it is your hands, And then disappointment fills me... I hide my distress, I lock away my lies... I wake up in my dreams. And find a key in my hands! She conquered me! Will I ever live happily? Unfaltering, Without toppling to the ground, Will I ever redeem myself fully? I need to tell you something... Priya... Phone... Excuse me... Hey! Superb! Hello? Priya... this is Gautham's father... Hello, Uncle! Today is Gautham's birthday... Oh... Please wish him from me... OK... Sure... There's a party this evening... let's dance... A small get-together... It's going to be fun! Hello! Sweetheart... What's for dinner? A glass of poison... OK... I'll be a little late. You drink it and get to bed, OK? We need to oil the hinges, the door's really tight. Have you been drinking? I promised you I won't drink... I came to get an apple, sweetheart. I'm really hungry, that's why... Don't know how I mixed my drink. It's hit me real bad... I need to get to the room somehow... Why is this slanted? I should sit... sit... Hello... Hey... my wife's gone to sleep... Hey, Baby... Bro... What? Do you want to come out for a drink? I've stopped drinking ages ago... What are you saying? My wife doesn't like it... I've stopped. Come on! If you do this, the arms get stronger. I am tired after all the exercise... Can I have tea, sweetheart? The sugar is here... I'm still high... Don't you want some, sweetheart? Drink it yourself! OK! Won't you ever change? Why should I change? I've listened to my wife, stopped drinking. What should I change? Why should I change? What did I do to change? What are you doing by that pole? This is a man's dance! Ladies, Gentlemen and Sunny... Priya has organized this party... And all of you are getting free drinks... Because today is Director Gautham's birthday! It's a day to celebrate! Feed Priya, Gautham... I don't want what he's eaten... It's going to be a great year... Definitely! Thank you!! Who told you about it? I can't hear you. I can't hear you at all... Did you get it from my passport? I can't hear you at all. I can't hear you. Come out... Outside? How did you know it was my birthday? I knew! Shall we take a ride? No... I have to leave. This is why it's better to go out with the guys... Huh??? Why is that? If I were with some guys, I could have gone on a ride the whole night... They wouldn't have given excuses to get back. OK... Let's go... Hey... Ilaiyaraaja Sir's song collection... Wow... Today is a day I am going to remember forever... It was so beautiful... What about you? OK... Ok! It's been a great day! Thank you... Hey... It's the Sunrise... looks beautiful, huh? Let's take a picture... it'll be a memory... You shimmer up the whole sky... And what do I do... oh, my! In my thoughts' vessel, You have poured yourself... You have changed the color of my white skies... You shimmer up the whole sky... And what do I do... oh, my! From my rainbow, you steal a thread, Into that you try entwining your heart... Oh, Priya, Priya... Are you the tremor in my heart? My senses have been praying hard... Are you the boon descended from above? Oh, Priya, Priya... Are you the tremor in my heart? My senses have been praying hard... Are you the boon descended from above? I lived in a flowerless world... Until the moment I saw you... And now I am a prisoner inside a flower... I never wanted the scent of a woman in my life... And now I look on helplessly... As your fragrance fills my lungs... Completely breathless, I have fallen in love with you... You shimmer up the whole sky... And what do I do... oh, my! From my rainbow, you steal a thread, Into that you try entwining your heart... Like a desert, I was dry and barren... Like a river you came by... And brought greenery into my life... If my heart is water, Are you the fish who swims in it? If my love is a forest, Are you deer grazing in it? Are you the man who basks in the heat of my shyness? You shimmer up the whole sky... And what do I do... oh, my! From my rainbow, you steal a thread, Into that you try entwining your heart... Oh, Priya, Priya... Are you the tremor in my heart? My senses have been praying hard... Are you the boon descended from above? Oh, Priya, Priya... Are you the tremor in my heart? My senses have been praying hard... Are you the boon descended from above? What is it? Nothing... this hair style suits you. Keep it like that! How are you going home? Hey, Gautham... All right, see you... Take care, darling... OK, Sunny... Priya... come on, shall we leave? Hey... you said you'd drop me... Sunny, I'll drop her... OK!!!!!!!!!! Priya, when you come to office tomorrow... Don't you get it??? Stop nagging me on the phone... Put the phone down... Hey, Narayan! Hey, Gautham! Hey... What happened? What's the problem? My wife... We fight everyday! What you said was completely true! You're so tough! You don't need love, a girl or a marriage... that's how it should be! I am jealous of you! But these women are really torturous... Hey... Who is this...? Someone you know? No... I don't know her... yeah... she travelled on the same flight... Oh... OK... Why is she standing here? You leave... We're talking... it's going to be a while... Sis... Priya... You look so different... Why are you so late, darling? This hair style suits you. Keep it that way. Hello... Priya... My watch is with you... I need it... Gautham... Your watch... From now on, please deal directly with Sunny... I'll leave... Is that so? No! You were right... One minute... What is it, dear? I'll marry Karthik. "Love is like the breeze... Even if you can't see it, you can feel it..." A small correction here... Other than that, the client is very happy... OK... OK... Sunny... if you let me know when the next project is... Sure... Why not? We'll figure it out after Priya's wedding... She's... marrying... Karthik? Yeah! He's a really nice guy... Didn't Priya tell you? Yeah, she did... in the beginning... Gautham, stop acting... You can't act, so don't bother! You think work is going to erase the pain you're feeling inside? Don't fool yourself... Let go of your ego! I was young once... You think I don't how much time you spent together abroad. You'll never get a girl like Priya ever again! It's your call after that. How is it you're getting married all of a sudden? Thought I should... Why...? Shouldn't I get married? You never mentioned it... Why should I tell you? We don't share any special bond, do we? As a friend, you could have told me... Friends? You and I...? I never knew you could be so cheap... What did I...??? Your image is more important to you... You'll do anything for that... Your friend called it being" tough"... Be "tough" till the end... We got so close abroad... I thought it was love. I wanted to put aside my ego and come and talk to you... But, even if we have a small tiff, you'll stop talking to me... Your father who loves you so much... Your close friends... You don't give a dam about them... Where do I stand a chance? If you ever fall in love... No... Forget love... You can't even be a friend... You must know to forgive, and compromise... You know neither... Please live happily, in your own insular world! Hey Baby, move away... Move away... Your father who loves you so much... Your close friends... You don't give a dam about them... Where do I stand a chance? In these 15 years, I'd never stepped into his room... "Things that I have wished and yearned for... but have never happened, I paint in colors." Dad... Dad... DAD... Surviving this long with a disease like this is a big thing... Your father has pancreatic cancer... Please don't cry... nothing's happened... don't cry... Everything is over... The doctor says he can't do anything... We didn't know anything... He hid it even from us... Don't get upset... I knew your father was unwell... Please don't be... Why did you hide it from me? Why didn't you tell me? I wanted to... but... You should have told me that he was unwell... You call yourself a friend? Are you a friend...? Let him go... why are you hitting him? Get up, Bro... get up! Why do you keep hitting him...? I am ashamed to call you a friend... You should have told me that he was unwell... Why this sudden concern for your dad? We love him more than you do... Stop accusing us... Do you know what happened the day we went to visit Priya at the hospital? He will make even an ordinary babe, sound extraordinary... You go ahead, I'll join you! Don't stay back, because the nurses look good! Be back soon... If you want to see me happy, promise me that you'll never tell Gautham about this... Shri... Hey, Shri... I am upset that the 3 of you have vowed never to get married... That's not on... Shri... There's only one thing I want... My dying wish... I want to see him get married... More than my cancer, it hurts me more to know that he will not get married even if I die. Though we promised we'd never get married, we changed our minds, just for your father... We thought if you saw us get married, you would change your mind too... That's why we got married... That's what your father wanted too... Shri, don't come near me... I'll break your teeth... Move away! Shri... What did you say the other day? You asked me if you were important or if my own life was more important. I'll say the very same thing today. My life is more important to me... Because YOU are my Life! You've made him cry. Come... We didn't do anything so earth shattering for you... we only got married... Now, who's crying like a chick...? Hope you realize everyone cries... It's been long since we've hugged... Love you, Bro... Love you, guys... Sorry, Bro... Priya, Gautham's dad is unwell... Who's with the patient? We are... One of you can go and see him. Go... He's going to be OK... Go... Be strong... Gautham... Sorry, Dad... I am sorry. Sorry, Dad... It's OK, Gautham... I am sorry, Dad... Forgive me! Bro... My son has spoken to me... Bro... how's your father? He's OK... I won't be worried if anything happens to me now... Nothing will happen to you, Uncle... Take care of yourself... Thank you... Hey... Gautham... This is... Bye... She's going... Go after her. Priya... One minute... What I did at the airport was wrong... I know how hurt you were. I realized how wrong I was. Everything you said to me at the beach was so right... I couldn't respond. I have been under the notion that all women are bad... After spending time with you I realized I was completely wrong. I'll remember every single moment we spent together in Switzerland... I now see how much love hurts... Thank you for making mea better man! I came to tell you this... Is this what you came to say? You've said so much... but have you said "sorry" to me yet? I may have deleted your number in anger... But I yearned for that message saying "sorry"... I waited for you to come home and say "Sorry, Priya". Do you know how much I've cried because of you...? Priya... I love you... I love you too... Happy Birthday... Shut up... Harris is doing the background score for this one... Silence... Is this a marketplace or what...? Why are you screaming like this...? Must one be silent at a hospital...? Obviously! Then why was a woman screaming so much at the maternity ward? Stupid! We must get completely smashed this evening... Definitely! Bro... She wants to drink with us...
