Palm Springs at last! (EX CLAIMING) Good old Palm Springs! (EX CLAIMING) - DAFFY: Queen of the desert spa! - But, Daffy... - Land of beautiful girls! - But, Daffy... - Swimming pools. Yippee! - Daffy! (LISPING) You and your short cuts! I told you to turn west at East St. Louis! Yeah, I know. (SHIVERING) The way I figure it, we're somewhere in the Hi-may-lay-us Mountains. That's pronounced Himalaya. Himalayas! Why you four-legged Marco Polo! That's in Asia! Himalayas! No wonder it's so cold. Look, Daff, I've got a wonderful idea, let's... Old pal, do me a favor, will you? Just don't do me any more favors. You just stay right here and study to be a snow shoe rabbit. I'm going back to Perth Amboy. All right, what's holding up the works? What's all the... The... (SCREAMS) Oh, what a cute little pink bunny rabbit. Just what I always wanted. My own little bunny rabbit. I will name him George, and I will hug him and pet him and squeeze him. I'm not a bunny rabbit! And pat him and pet him and... You're hurting me. Put me down, please. And rub him and caress him and... (SCREAMING) I ain't no bunny rabbit! Not a bunny rabbit, George? Then how come you have long ears, how come? Long ears? (CHUCKLING) Those aren't ears. Those are sleeves! So, now, put me down, please, huh? Oh, George. You were naughty to pretend you was a bunny rabbit. I will punish you good! Bad old George! Look, doc! I know where there's a real bunny rabbit. A very cuddly and a fuzzy rabbit! And then after a carrot burger and a malt in Al-ba-kur-kay... Oh, Bugsy! Bugsy buddy! Oh, hi. Eh, what's up duck? Come here, old pal, hmm? My own little bunny rabbit. (EX CLAIMS) Hey! An abobinanable snowman! I will name him George and I will hug him and pet him... (LISPING) Oh, sure, I know I'm a louse. But I'm a live louse. SNOWMAN: And I will give him security. And I will keep him warm like a mother hen so he will never feel rejected or lack for love. Poor old Bugs. But any way you look at it, it's better he should suffer. After all it was me or him and obviously it couldn't be me. It's a simple matter of logic. I'm not like other people. I can't stand pain. It hurts me. Okay, Ah-bomb! Here's your bunny rabbit! The bunny rabbit, George? - Bunny rabbit? Me? - Yes, you, doc. Oh, oh, very funny. Ha, ha, very droll. Hey, shorty! What do you consider to be the distinguishing characteristics of a rabbit? The distinguishing character... Yeah, yeah! What makes a rabbit look like a rabbit? (STAMMERING) Why, long ears! And whom around here has long ears? Sorry to have to do this to you, bud. Eh! Don't give it a second thought. Oh, boy! Just what I always wanted! My own little bunny rabbit. They really do make a charming couple. I will rub him and pet him and squeeze him and rub him and stroke his bill and rub his pretty feathers and... Hey. Wait a minute! Bunny rabbits don't have feathers and bills. I know. I know. There goes your bunny rabbit! Hey! George! Wait! (CHUCKLES) Look out, bunny rabbit! This I gotta see! And I searched and I searched. Whew, it's hot! But I never caught up with my little bunny rabbit. That's tough, Mr. Ab-domina-bubble. And now I'll never... Gosh it's hot. Never see my bunny rabbit again. Don't give up hope yet, doc. If you love him, he'll come back. Well, here I am! Massacre started yet? Fireworks gone off? Balloon gone up? Oh, boy, a bunny rabbit! Just what I always wanted! I will name him George. And I will hug him and squeeze him and pet him and pat him and... Hey! Hey, what do you know? He melted! He really was a snowman! Abominable, that is. English - SDH
