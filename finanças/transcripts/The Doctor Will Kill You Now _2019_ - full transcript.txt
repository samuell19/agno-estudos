Hey, Duncan, you ready to give it a go? - You guys know each other? - Yeah. Yeah, we met at the bar earlier while you were napping. This is Macy. She's one of the ski instructors here. Hey, it's nice to meet you. Sarah. Likewise. Duncan says you're regulars here. Oh... She's more of a regular on the slopes. I'm a regular at the bar. Well, it's nice meeting you. Yeah, I'll see you guys later. Yeah, you know me. I'm a people person. Hey, I do know you. I trust you, which is why I said yes. Just... come on. I'm still getting past what happened. Look, I asked you to marry me. That should be proof enough that you're all I need. Hey, Duncan, can I grab you a sec? Yeah, sure. Hey, go ahead and head down. I'll meet you there. All right, what do we got? 32-year-old female, ski accident. Left knee's a mess. Tore everything. Lab work's no good. Ouch. Get her MR up on the monitor, please. Are head and C spine clear? Yep, all clear. Okay. Let's stabilize the femur. And then we're going to reconstruct, okay? Scissors. Masks. All right, here. Excuse me. Come on, let me get in here, please. Oh, this looks like severe internal hemorrhaging. I can stop this! Hurry! Quickly! I can save the leg. Pressure's holding steady at 125 over 75. - Scalpel. - Heart rate good at 82. Wait! Her pressure's dropping! 100 over 60, 90 over 50! Gary, she's crashing! What's going on? Oh, I think a bone fragment nicked an artery or something. Suction! Come on, let's keep this clear! Guys, let's go! Should I page vascular? You can, but it doesn't matter! I can't wait! Asystole. She's flat-lining. Start CPR, bag her, one milligram... Hold on, hold on! Nurse, prep for defib! Let's go! Okay, okay, move, move! Gary, are we ready? Gary? Hey, wait, wait, wait. Pulse is stabilizing. You did it. That was friggin' close. Solid work finding that hole in a sea of blood. So shall we amputate below the knee? Vascular's not here yet. Seems like a straightforward operation. I didn't do all that work to cut off her leg. I don't know how you did that. Sometimes it's better to be lucky than it is good. That wasn't luck. Oh, hello, doctor. I heard what you did for her. It's quite impressive. Thank you. Hey, what can you tell me about Sarah Crenshaw? Who's here for her? Family? No, but her family has been notified, though. Okay. What about her fiancé? No fiancé. We've been looking, but we haven't found him yet. Is there anything else I can help you with, doctor? No. Thank you. I brought you some magazines from the lounge. Oh, yes, please. There's only so much daytime television I can watch. Well, I don't know if those are gonna be much better for you. Well I'll take it over another courtroom show. Fair enough. How you feeling? You know, like someone who just got hit by a car. Apart from the obvious, how are you feeling? Honestly, I don't remember the last time I've been in so much pain. Well, that is to be expected. The doctor will check on your progress and see if he can get a higher dose on your pain meds. It will get better. That's good to know. Thanks. Yeah. Speaking of which, here he is. Look who's awake. If it isn't the rock star surgeon who saved my life. I'm really more of a jazz singer, you know. That's nice. I like jazz. I also like keeping both my legs. This is turning into your day then. Yeah, I'd agree if I weren't in a hospital bed at the moment. She's also in a lot of pain. Can I up her morphine? What's your pain scale? Uh, eight, but if say nine, could I get the good stuff? Up her to 80 milligrams, the good stuff. Well, I think the worst is behind you. But you're not out of the woods. You'll have a really nasty scar on your leg for a while. I'll gladly take it if I get to keep my leg. Honestly, I don't care if it's permanently blue as long as I get to walk again. Good attitude. Well, it looks good. I think a couple of days' bed rest. And then we're gonna start your physical therapy. Mmm, can't wait. Thank you for that. It's what we do. Anything else, doctor? No, I don't think so. I'll be back tomorrow to see you, okay? Sounds like a party. I wish. Until then... He's being really modest. What do you mean? If there's a medical award, he's won it. He's mastered almost every procedure there is. Oh, wow. He really is a rock star... ...or a jazz singer. He's definitely something. All right, there you go. I'm gonna see if I can find you some newer magazines. Oh, thank you, nurse. Oh, please, call me Farrah. Okay. Thank you, Farrah. And not too shabby to look at either. Excuse me? I said Dr. Water's not too shabby to look at. Dr. Water? Yeah, as in tall drink of... Ah, yes. I see. If you say so. What? You don't think so? Oh, he's hot. I don't know. He's my doctor. I'm Rosalind. You can call me Rosie. Mm, nice to meet you, Rosie. Sarah. Oh, I heard. It sounds like that our brilliant doctor went above and beyond for you. Let's hope he does the same for me, okay? What are you in for? - Skydiving accident. - What? - I'm kidding. - Oh, my God. Double bypass. You? It's a gift from birth. So it's your first surgery? Yeah, other than my wisdom teeth. Hey, do you mind if I borrow one of your magazines? Oh, yeah. Knock yourself out. The morphine's finally kicking in, so... Oh, well, you'll feel better soon. Can you believe what Khloe's been up to? You know, I've actually been more focused on Kim. Oh, okay. Hey, Doc. Good morning, Rosalind. Please, call me Rosie. - Good morning, Rosie. - It sure is. So how am I doing? We have a few more labs to come in. I'm gonna know soon when we're gonna wheel you to the OR, okay? Okay. In the meantime, you're here. We're monitoring you and that high blood pressure of yours. Everything's gonna be great. Okay. Great news. Thanks, Doc. You're welcome, Rosie. Sarah? It's okay. Hi, doctor. Hi. How you feeling? A little woozy. That's to be expected. You're in a morphine cartoon. I'm not complaining. Yeah, only the best for our patients. What's that? This is a plantar reflex test. Go just like this. Ooh, see? Now if your big toe had gone up versus going down, that would have indicated a bit of nerve damage, but you look good. It tickles. That's good. I think we're gonna start you on physical therapy today. Do I have to do anything? I'm afraid so. You're gonna have to do quite a bit. Look, I'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you. This is gonna be an uphill climb. Sounds magical. It can't all be morphine and laughs. Oh, if only. Indeed. Well, I'm gonna... I'm gonna be on my way. Eat your breakfast and I'll come back and speak to you after your physical therapy. Also known as boot camp. Yeah, something like that. I'm looking for Jake? Yeah, that's me. I'm Sarah. Oh, right. Skiing accident. Yeah. Yeah, that's gonna be my nickname, I think, from now on. That's quite a story. And if I have anything to say about it, you'll be out of that chair and back on the slopes by next year. Are you out of your mind? I'm not getting on skis again! Yeah? Let's see how you feel about that this time next year. In the meantime, I'll just settle for getting you back on your feet. Sound like a plan? Sounds like a good plan. Good. Let's go over here. All right, park you right here. - Let's lock you out. - Thank you. Now I've put together a really great plan. It's gonna be rough at first. You're probably gonna hate me a lot. But in the end, I really think you're gonna like it. As long as it gets me walking again. It will, I guarantee it. So where do we start? We start with stretches. Oh, easy. We don't wanna make your injury worse. - Okay. - Nice and slow. Ready? Up? There you go. All right. Okay. Nice and slow. Ready? - Okay, yeah. - Down. There you go. Breathe. There you go, good. Let's stretch your legs out. Okay. Thank you. - There you go. - Okay. Okay. Now just deep breath. Now you ready to get started? Yeah. Easy. There you go. Ooh, easy. Well, that was horrible. You're welcome. I know it doesn't seem like it now, but it will get easier. I don't believe you. How are you feeling? In pain. Pain is good. It tells our body that it's working. Well, then my body should be getting paid overtime. Really, though, I don't... phew... I don't know if I can do this again tomorrow. Sometimes I like my clients to create specific goals, all right? So what's the one place in the world that you want to go skiing? I already told you. I'm not going skiing again. At least for a while. Maybe, but you seem like you're a lot like me. You don't give up easily. Fine. I've always wanted to go to the Swiss Alps. All right. Well, one day sooner than you think, you're gonna send me a postcard from there. Doesn't really seem like it. I know, but it will. You did really well today, all right? Tomorrow will be better. Told you, front door service. And here we are. Here we are. How you feeling now? Uh, still in pain, but surprisingly better at the same time. It's all part of my master plan. Whatever gets me out of here fastest. Everything okay? Yeah. I had a hairbrush and I don't know where it went. Well, I'm sure it'll show up. I can get you another hairbrush if you want. Nah. A hospital brush is more like a torture device. Anyway, thank you for the lift. You got it. See you tomorrow? I was afraid you would say that. You know, I'm gonna get you on skis before you know it. You are a kind, but evil man. Call me a dreamer. Hello, Sarah. Oh, Dr. Vincent. What's the good word? I was gonna ask you that. You had a PT session today with Jack, right? I think his name is Jake. Oh. Yeah, of course. What did you think? I think that it was a lot easier learning how to walk the first time around. You may be right. Speaking of walking, actually, I want to get a fresh set of x-rays so I can get a really good look at that leg, all right? You bet. I mean, anything that you need to do, I'm in. Excellent. I will have Farrah schedule you the next appointment, okay? Okay, thanks, Dr. Vincent. Oh, call me Gary. Okay. Thank you, Dr. Gary. Until then. Okay, good, good. Let's do a few more reps. Nice. Up. There you go. Good. - Good, good. - Okay. Hey, what's with big brother watching? Oh, you know, he's everywhere. All right, let's flip you around for the next set. Ready. Up you go. Upsie-daisie. - Okay? - Okay. Stable. Okay. My favorite part. - Oh, oh! I'm sorry. - Oh, are you okay? Yeah, yeah. Just an injury that likes to flare up every now and then. Oh. Is that a torn distal bicep tendon? Dr. Vincent. Hi. Sorry. I didn't mean to startle you. Uh, sports injury? Yeah, yeah. I just hurt it playing baseball. You look like you're in a lot of pain. I can write you a prescription if you'd like. No, no, I'm good, I'm good. So what brings you in? I'm just checking in. Well, Sarah's doing really well. That's great. Listen, I'm gonna sit and watch, Sarah, if that's okay? I wanna make sure Jake and I are on the same page. Yeah, okay, sure. You're the doctor. Excellent. Just checking emails here. And then he just started watching us. Watching you do what? Like my exercises and my stretches and stuff. Well, he just sat there and watched you work out? I don't know. Is that kind of... awkward? I mean, I don't know. I guess it's good he actually cares about your progress. But I never had a doctor do that to me. Right? Well, not that I wouldn't mind. Well, no, no. I guess I don't mind it really. It's just... Doctors are strange, honey, all of them. I think it's that God complex that they have. I don't know. Yeah, sure. So do you want to watch some CourtTV? Hmm? No, you go ahead. I'm gonna, ugh... I'm gonna try to find a book to read. All right, suit yourself. Be careful on those. Right. Let's get you up there, huh? Yep. How are your meds? They're doing the trick. How do you feel? I... I thought I'd be in less pain by now. You're essentially learning to walk on a leg that was almost completely destroyed, right? I know the pain is horrible. But it's better than not having a leg. I mean, I'm gonna get out of here soon, right? Define soon. Like before withdrawing social security? Look, I know it's true we can only keep you so long. But you're not out of the woods yet, okay? You need to continue to exercise. The slightest accident would put you back to square one, and you can barely move. But that's not gonna change by me being here. I mean, I need to get back to my real life. I want that too... in time. Okay. So what's next? What's next is we keep you in physical therapy. We monitor the wound, make sure it's healing properly. And then we get you back to your regular life when it's safe to do so. Mm-hmm. I just kind of want to get out of here. I want that too, but I want you to walk out with no lasting problems. Yes. Very good. There you go. Now let's do four more steps. Can we make it three? - Four more. - Fine. There you go. Doing great. You got it. This is great. You're doing well. There you go. What's your favorite thing about skiing? I don't know. It's my happy place. Can't check your phone for work emails when you're skiing the mountain. It's just you and the snow, the wind in my face. You're doing great. Wait! Where are you? It's all you, Sarah! Oh, my God! - You're doing it! - I'm doing it! Yeah! Oh! I got you! I got you! It's okay, it's okay. - Oh, oh, oh... - I am... I'm so sorry. I... - It's okay. - I just, uh... I understand. I... Feel the same way. Well, we just... we gotta be careful because it kind of breaks the rules. I know. It's just, um... We need to talk about it. Technically, Dr. Vincent said that I'd be released when I started walking, and now I'm walking. You'll be released soon and... So we could talk about it then. And then we'll figure out what this is, I mean, if it's anything at all. Well, I think we both know that it's something. Let's take you back. Yeah, yeah. Oh, look at you. Who's gonna pick you up? Just a friend from work. Good. Send me an email or something, will you? Let me know that you got home okay. Of course. I kissed Jake. You what? You heard me. Well, this is how you're gonna leave me? I knew you would love it. Of course! Okay, what happened? How do you know that it isn't more than just a crush? I don't know. I don't know what it is. Hmm. You gonna pursue it? Maybe. I don't know. I mean, he's helping you heal. Is that gonna be a problem? I mean, I guess we'll find out. Okay. Well... Knock, knock. I believe it's time for somebody's release? Oh, are you here to take me home? Sorry, Rosie, but I'm afraid Sarah gets her walking papers. Oh, ouch. Okay. Always a bridesmaid, never a bride! Come here, you. So you ready to get back in the real world? Oh, you have no idea. Oops. There's your purse. - Thank you. - You bet. All right. Bye. Oh, bye. Thank you. - Bye, Sarah. - Oh, bye. Thank you so much for everything. You're very welcome. I'd say I'm gonna miss it here but I don't want to lie. Don't worry, you'll be back for PT soon. Don't remind me! - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Hi, Steven. Sarah, just checking in for an update on the website. Uh, yeah, just give me until Monday, okay? I'm getting back up to speed here. Did Megan do the THD report yet? Yes. I'll have her forward it to you. But let me warn you. It still needs some work. How much work? More than you're gonna want to do. But it's necessary and we need it by Monday at the latest. And there's nobody else available to work on it, huh? No. All due respect, Sarah, we weren't staffed to prepare to lose you for a month. Whoa! Trust me. I wasn't prepared for it either. You know what I mean. We... We all want you to heal on your own terms. We're all cheering for you over here. But deadlines don't change. And you're still the best hope I've got in getting it on time and under budget. If I can get a copy done on Monday, then we can get the promo out on Tuesday. And the website? Yeah, that too. Um... Give me until Tuesday? Sarah... Steven, I'm gonna need the extra day. Fine. Tuesday then. What's the news on coming back to the office? Uh, not really sure yet. My doctor says it's gonna be a while before I can physically get back to work. I can deal with that as long as the work gets done. And Tuesday at the latest on the website, right? Yes, Tuesday, the latest. Okay. Get it done. Sarah! Oh, Dr. Vincent! You startled me. Please. Call me Gary, remember? Dr. Gary. Looks like you're almost walking without your crutches. Yeah, almost. Hey, listen. While I've got you, I want you to make an appointment with me, okay? I want to look at that wound. And then we should go over your latest x-rays. - Great. I'll come on in. - Okay. Hey, can I ask you something? It's a little sensitive. What's wrong? It's about Jake. He's known around the hospital for getting involved with nurses and patients. What? Well, I'm not naming names, but the latest was a nurse. The hospital got sued. - Are you serious? - Yeah. He hasn't made any unwanted advances towards you, has he? No, no. I mean... No, he hasn't at all. He's been great. You know, if he has, you shouldn't protect him. I'm not protecting him. He hasn't been inappropriate. Good. Hey, that's great to hear. Listen, if he does get, you know, familiar, just let me know. As your doctor, I'm here to help you with anything. Thank you. Okay. See you then. All right, you're getting better every day. Why do I still feel terrible? Well, it's part of a process. Some days will be easier than the others. Great. Hey, can you take a picture for me? Don't, ugh. Six weeks ago, I was laid up in a hospital bed. I just want to show off a little. I think it'll help me feel better. Okay. Is this crack in your phone from the accident? Yeah. Guess I broke everything. Thank you. Hey, I was thinking, do you want to come over tonight? We still need to talk about... stuff. Uh, I have baseball tonight. Can we meet tomorrow? Yeah. Tomorrow then. Okay. Excuse me. Doc, what brings you in? Please, call me Gary. Okay. What can I do for you, Gary? It's about Sarah. Would it be possible to get a copy of her file? I want to make sure everything's going just as it should. Yeah, of course. Oh, you want it now? If it's not too much trouble. I gotta make copies of it. Can I just get it to you tomorrow? I'll wait. Doctor? What are you doing here? I'm embarrassed. I thought... I thought I left my bag here. That's Sarah's bag. Yes, it is. Well, good afternoon. Afternoon, doctor. You know, I'll get that file tomorrow. Thanks. All right. Hot stuff coming through. Oh! Yep. Ah, thank you for cooking. I enjoy cooking, plus I thought it might impress you. Oh, you might be right. So how you feeling? I'm actually feeling a lot better right now, like in a lot of less pain. Good. Before you know it, you'll be swishing down the mountain. Funny. It's a seed. Hey, so can we have our talk now? Yeah, sure. Listen, Sarah, I want you to be assured that what happened was not a mistake and I... Actually, before we have this conversation, can I just ask you something? Yeah. I was told that you have seen some nurses at the hospital. Where did you hear that from? It's not important. Is it true? Yeah. I mean, it happened once. How long ago was it? Um, almost two years. And why did it end? Well, I mean, we only dated for... you know, went out a couple of times. Wasn't anything serious. I was told that she sued the hospital. Yeah, she did, but not because of me or her and I dating for a month. She was in the midst of filing a lawsuit. I mean, that was even before we started seeing each other. Yeah. She got hurt in the OR and the hospital refused to pay up. I see. Listen, I know you might have a hard time trusting me... I just can't get hurt again, especially after all this. Well, I have nothing to hide, okay? I'm an open book with you, Sarah. Yeah, I've made mistakes in the past, but I make up for my mistakes. I'm sorry. Just... I wasn't planning on all of this. I wasn't looking for this. Yeah, looking for what? I wasn't looking... I was just trying to learn how to walk. And now, all of a sudden, I'm potentially getting into another relationship. And I just want to make sure that what you and I both feel is real. It's not just me feeling this way because I'm being vulnerable right now. Well, I know how I feel, and how I feel is real. Yeah, me too. And I just want to see where this goes. You know, you're that important to me and I hope you know that. I do. Feels so good. I can't believe work just keeps piling so much stuff on you. It's tough for you just trying to get better. There's no one else to do it. You know what? It's a long weekend. Why don't we get away? Get out of town and really enjoy our first official weekend as a couple? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Where? I don't know. Nothing too strenuous. How about a weekend at my cabin? You have a cabin? Yeah. Well, it's nothing luxurious or anything like that. But, yeah, it's got a couple rooms and a lovely little fireplace. Better yet, no stairs. It's on even terrain. All right. Why not? Great. Oh, I'm supposed to have an appointment with Dr. Vincent thought, on Monday. You mean Gary? Is it just me or is it so weird to call him by his first name? It's totally weird. Let me just see if I can reschedule. This is Dr. Vincent. Dr. Vincent, I wasn't expecting to get you on the phone. I, uh, had my office forward all my calls to my cell phone. I'm expecting a call, you see. Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you. It's not a problem. What can I do for you? I know it's last-minute, but I was just wondering if maybe we can reschedule our appointment for Monday? Is everything okay? Yeah, I was just planning on getting out of town for the long weekend. Where are you going? Uh, getting to a cabin for the weekend. You're going camping? No, no. Just a little getaway. Listen, I have to advise against this, okay? You're not completely healed. If you were to trip or, worse, break a bone, you'd be somewhere where you couldn't get help. You'd be back to square one! I don't think I'm gonna fall. You didn't think you were gonna crash skiing either. I don't think that's very... Listen, as the only one who knows the true extent of your injury. If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead, okay? Or at the very least missing a leg! I'm the only one that knows the true extent. I have to say no to this. Do you understand? I'm sorry, I don't... Do you understand?! Yeah, okay. Guess we won't go. Who are you gonna go with? I don't see how that's... Well, let me remind you that I'm the one that saved your life, okay? Not Jake! Did you hear that? Hear what? Nothing. What's going on? Dr. Vincent doesn't think I should go away for the weekend because I am still healing and, therefore, still at risk. Well, it's just out of town. I mean, you're gonna be with me anyway. Besides, you're probably safer there than you are here. Here, you're running up and down the stairs all day. I know. He just... he advised against it. Well, he's being ridiculous. What's the point of getting released from the hospital if you gotta live your life in bubble wrap? Oh, I don't... Hold on a second. I have an idea. Be right back. Okay! Hi! Hey, Sarah, how are you? I'm okay. Just as well as can be expected. Are you in pain? Oh, always. Always in pain. Yeah, I did, but not anymore. What happened? I don't know. Something weird. Rosie, can I call you back? I just... someone's at the door. Okay. Talk to you later. Well, it's not a cabin, but we can still go camping in the yard. You're out of your mind. Your castle awaits! What is this? Is that an air mattress? Biggest one they had in the store. Probably more comfortable than your own bed. Well, I guess we're just gonna have to find out. Okay. But first, s'mores. A man after my heart. I'm not gonna lie to you. I don't have good news. What do you mean? I mean, I know you're fond of Jake. But I don't like what I see. What? I think his methods are doing more harm than good. I don't understand. Your bones aren't healing the way they should. There's repetitive stress at the fracture site and the reconstructed joint... you're not healing properly. Okay. Jake's methods aren't helping you. They're hurting you. I think it's time we get a new therapist. Physical therapy isn't like medicine. It's not specific that way, all right? It's like the wild west. Some practitioners use new untested methods, and it ends up doing more harm than good. But you were the one that recommended Jake to me. I did, I was wrong, and I'm sorry. So I'm getting worse? No, no, you're not getting worse. You're just not healing the way you should. Hello? Okay, thank you. Bye. I'm sorry. I have to go. - Okay. Thank you. - I'm sorry. That's okay. Hey, doc? Did you get everything sorted? I'm sorry? The other day when you lost your bag? Uh... Yes, I did. Thank you, Rosie. You betcha, Doc. If you ever need me to draw you a map of this place, I know it by heart. I have no doubt. What was that all about? It's nothing. It's just more of her usual nonsense. Anything to worry about? Not anymore. How are you feeling? Hi, Farrah. Hi, Sarah. - There she is. - Hey, you came! Of course, I did. I told you that I would. Thank you. How you holding up? Fine. Um... It'll all be over soon. Hey, you have got the best of the best working on you. Yeah. Speaking of which, how are you and Dr. Vincent? What do you mean? He just... he seems to show up wherever you are. All right, Rosalind. - Rosie. - Rosie. It's time. Okay. See you soon, kiddo. I'll be right there. Rosalind? Rosalind? Can you hear me? Just breathe deeply, okay? Too bad you couldn't keep your mouth shut. All doctors to the ER! Code Blue! All doctors to the ER! I'm so sorry. Oh, God, it was just supposed to be routine. Did they say what happened? No. Just... that it was sudden. Gosh, it's awful. I don't know what to say. I think I'm just gonna take some sleeping pills and lie down for a bit. No. I don't think that's a good idea. What? Well, you're emotional right now. And you've been taking a lot of pain medication. And putting more pills in your system isn't a good idea right now. Jake, I just lost someone. Can you quit it with the third degree right now? Yeah. I just don't think that it's... I just want to sleep for a bit, okay? Besides... you're the reason I'm taking all this medication in the first place. Wait, what's that supposed to mean? I spoke to Dr. Vincent today and he showed me x-rays of my leg. And? He thinks that you're making the injury worse. What? That doesn't make any sense. And he also thinks that I should see a different physical therapist. That's ridiculous. I've been helping you since the beginning. You don't have to listen to him. He's my doctor. He's not the only one that wants you to get better. I know that this is gonna be hard to hear. But I think that, um... it might be best for our relationship if I do see a different physical therapist. You're serious? I'm sorry. Yeah. So am I. Jake? Jake? Come on, please. - Hey, get a second opinion! - What? Go see another doctor, get a second opinion. Vincent is wrong on this! I guarantee you that any other physical therapist would be doing the exact same thing that I'm doing. But, Jake, I saw the x-rays. Yeah. I'm sure he'd show you all kinds of things if given the chance. What is that supposed to mean? Come on, Sarah! You don't see the way he looks at you? It's supposed to be very professional. He's gone way too personal! Oh, because you're one to talk for getting personal with the patients, right? If you need a recommendation, I can get that for you. Okay, look, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. No, you're right. It's fine. Jake, please don't be upset. You know, I'm gonna go, okay? Because I think you have a new physical therapist to find. Jake? Jake! Hey, Carl. What can I get you? - Whiskey soda, please. - You got it. Sarah. Can't get to the phone. Jake? Jake, is that you? Hey. Hi. Can you talk? Okay. Florence Nightingale effect? Really? I'm just telling you what he told me. What's that? It's one of my pain pills. Everything okay? They're not the same. What do you mean? It's the same bottle, but the pain pills are different. I know one might be different because it's a generic brand or a higher dosage. I know. No, maybe. I'll just have to ask Dr. Vincent when I see him next. Are you still gonna take 'em? I mean, I kind of have to. I'm in a lot of pain. I would advise against that. Maybe take Ibuprofen until you can get it sorted out? You know what? You're right. Just gonna put 'em in the kitchen, then. You know, out of sight, out of mind. You want an egg roll? Yeah. Hey, can I ask you something? Yeah, anything. Why did you come back the other night? I didn't come back. Jake, come on, I saw you. I went to the Roadhouse to get a drink. And then I watched the game and... So you didn't come back? No. I saw somebody in my house, and now I have pain pills missing. I think you're being a little paranoid. No! Well, where did everything go? I don't know. Maybe you lost track. You've been taking a lot of those pills lately. Yeah, well, I'm taking a lot of pills when I'm in pain. And I'm in pain all the time. Okay, I'm sorry. It's fine. Gary gave me a refill today anyway. - Okay, there it is. - What? Oh, he's Gary now. Oh, come on, please don't start this! He's got a crush on you, Sarah. - He does not! - Yeah, he clearly does! That's why he's telling you to go to a new physical therapist. He's trying to eliminate the competition. That's why he's saying all that stuff about me. Jake, he's my doctor. He's just trying to help. And I'm just trying to protect you. You matter to me. We matter to me. Yeah, we matter to me, too. If it makes you feel better listening to Dr. Vincent and seeing a new physical therapist, that's fine. But don't give up on us. I know, I know. I'm... I'm sorry. It's just six weeks ago, I was just planning a ski trip. And now I'm learning to walk, and falling in love. Like I said, I just wasn't planning any of this. I know. And I love you too. Jack and Ginger, please? You got it. You haven't even bought me a drink yet. I'm sorry? My name's Ginger. I was making a joke. What's your name? Is it Jack? Uh, close. Jake. May I please have a cranberry vodka, Carl? Yes, ma'am. What's the score? 24-20. Cool. Carl? The usual? All right. All right, good, good, good! Go, go, go! Nice! Nice! Good, good! Yes! Whoa! Whoa! Easy! Sorry, you got the wrong guy. Sorry. I got lost in the excitement. Yeah, apparently so. All right, I'm out. Better luck next time, I guess. Hey, Kenny? Walk me to my car? Sure. Oh. Yes. Any problems? Nope. Hello? Hey, Sarah, it's Gary. Listen, I want... Are you crying? Uh... Yeah, sorry. I'm just... Uhh... Well, you were right about Jake. What do you mean? I, um... caught him cheating on me. Stay where you are. I'm gonna make a house call. Thank you. Yeah, I just... I feel so stupid. Oh, I'm sorry. I tried to warn you. I can't say it's something I'm happy being right about. You did try to warn me, didn't you? You're a good man. You know, Sarah, you've been through a lot of trauma. I mean, you're vulnerable right now. Yeah, well, it doesn't stop me from feeling miserable. Maybe you've just been looking for the wrong kind of guy. Well, I actually think, um... that I got to be alone for a while. I know exactly how that feels. Oh! I'm sorry! Nope, nope! I got it, I got it. Hold on. Did you get any on you? Uh, no. It's an old jacket anyway, so... I think you look great in that jacket every time I see you. I don't think you've seen me in it, have you? Maybe not. My mistake. Look, you look good in nearly everything. You know what? I actually have to head out. I, ooh... I have to meet up with Jake to end it, so... Be strong. If you need me, call me for anything. Okay. I'll try. Thank you. Hey, Sarah, how are you doing on your meds? Do you need any more? No. I think I'm all set there. Look, I don't understand. I thought everything was going great. Yeah, I did too... until you cheated on me. What are you talking about? How do you explain this? Where'd you get that? Does it even matter? That was some woman at a bar. She kissed me and I shot her down. What does that even mean? I was watching the basketball game at the Roadhouse. She kissed me. I didn't kiss her back! Okay, I told her I wasn't interested. I don't even know who she is! Oh, well, it looks like you know her pretty well. Sarah, I am not cheating on you. Jake, just put yourself in my shoes. What does this look like to you? I don't know! I don't know who those people are! I don't even know how you got that photo! Oh, my gosh, you could have at least come up with a more convincing story. How could I come up with a more convincing story other than the truth? And I'm telling you the truth! It's a mistake! Yeah. I'm beginning to think so. This whole thing has been one big mistake! Sarah! Sarah, come on! You think you can get away with anything, don't you? Said the cheater. You set me up! Oh, I'd be careful making those accusations if I were you. You stay away from Sarah. You understand me? Or you'll do what, Jake? Don't test me, Gary. You won't like it. Is that some kind of threat? You're damn right it is. Here it is. Thank you. What do you need it for? She was a patient of mine as well. I just need to make sure that my therapy didn't contribute to her death. No. It says here, "failed bypass". Thanks. Can I ask you what happened? Jake, I know it's rough. But it's not the first time someone's died on the table. We all liked her, but sometimes it happens. I know. Dr. Vincent's a great doctor, but he can't save 'em all. Yeah, you're right, but she was close to Sarah. I know. I'm sorry. They said something about complications during surgery due to anesthetic. Now that doesn't sound right. Dr. Vincent's the best we have. He wouldn't have made some rookie mistake like that. She was allergic to the anesthesia. It wasn't in her chart. She went into an anaphylactic shock. Wait. Wasn't in her chart? The woman's had a handful of surgeries. I don't know. Okay, I'm gonna look into it. Thanks, Paige. Paige? Was Jake asking about Sarah Crenshaw? No, not at all. He was asking about Rosalind Golding. What was he asking about her? Just how she died. What did you tell him? She went into anaphylactic shock due to anesthesia. It does seem odd, doesn't it, that we missed that somehow? Considering her medical history... Hey! I don't miss anything! Is that clear? I didn't mean to imply anything... I would hope not! You sent that photo! Get off me, man! You sent that photo! - No, I didn't! - Who sent it then? I don't know! Look, I was hired, okay? By who? I don't know his name! It was a doctor! He drives a black coupe, okay? That's all I know! Yeah, if we reschedule the Grainier meeting, we can redirect our attention to the Kinsey account for a couple of days. Well, I don't know how you managed to pull it off, but the new website looks excellent. Thank you. There's gonna be a lot more where that came from. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. I think I'm gonna have a lot of extra time from now on. Consider me back in the office Monday. Not if it's gonna hurt you. You're doing fine as is. Oh, wait. Steven, hold on. I have an incoming call... Never mind. Okay. Are you sure you don't need more time away from the office? Yeah, don't worry about it. I'd rather be there than sitting here reliving the past six weeks. If you're sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Hi, this is Sarah. Can't get to the phone right now. But leave a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks. Sarah, it's me. I know you're not talking to me right now, but I found out everything about that photo. Please call me. Dr. Vincent set me up! Please call me. She isn't meant to be with you, Jake. She never was. Hello? Yeah, this is she. Yeah, Jake Drummond, uh-huh. No, no, that doesn't make any sense because I was just with him. Um, no, that, uh... I don't... I'm sorry. I came as soon as I heard the news about Jake. You okay? Doctor... I'm so sorry. I mean, I know we had our differences. But he was a good guy. He didn't deserve to die like that. What happened? Were you there? No, no. I only heard. I came here as soon as I was... told. It was an accident. I guess he was trying to lift too much weight. I don't really understand how that could have happened. Can I come in? Yeah. Do you want any coffee or anything? No. No, no, I'm fine. Thanks. At least don't make me drink alone. I don't think this is such a good idea considering your condition. I think I'm allowed one glass, given the circumstances. Come here for a second, please. You know, you shouldn't be drinking while taking these meds. I know. It's doctor's orders. Okay. I'll take it easy. Hey, thank you so much for being here, Gary. What are you doing? I, um... I'm here for you, Sarah. I've always been here for you. Oh, okay. Oh, I'm sorry. It's just, uh... It's just very sudden. I don't feel very good. The pain killers and that wine, I knew this was gonna happen. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you're right. It's just that... I think I need a minute. You'll be okay. Let me get you some water. - Hold on. - Okay. Could you actually get me a pillow for under my leg? Of course. Thank you, Gary. What is this? Oh. Sarah, I can... I can explain this. Just give me... How long have you been following me? Well, I'm your doctor. You call this being my doctor? Oh! Look, I know how this must look. This looks crazy! That's exactly how this looks! Sarah, I'm not crazy! I love you. What? Well, you heard me. I am in love with you! I've loved you from the very beginning! I have not once given you a signal that I was even interested in you! Oh, my God, these photos. I gave you everything! I gave you your life! You need to leave. I need to leave? I've been here for you since the very beginning! You owe me! I owe you? Everything is ruined because of you! You set up Jake! Jake wasn't right for you. I did what I had to do to protect your feelings! Don't you... He left me no choice! You are insane! This is insane! No, no, no, Sarah! Sarah, you gotta be with me! Let go! Oh! I didn't want it to be like this, Sarah. I wanted us to be happy. I still want us to be happy! You're beautiful, and perfect and special! I saw that from the very beginning. Jake and Rosalind, they didn't deserve you! Jake? Rosalind? You did it. You did it. I did what I had to do to protect us! I couldn't let anybody get in between us! I... I had to kill them. Feeling woozy, doc? Maybe it's because your wine was loaded up with those pain pills that you were trying to feed me. You know, I was always wondering why those didn't really seem to work. It's because you were giving me a weaker dosage because you needed to keep me sick! Because you needed me to depend on you! Ah! Who else would have sent me that photo? I had to do that! That wasn't very nice, Sarah. Now let's just stay calm and talk this through! Ah! Get away from me! Oh! I was there with you every day since they brought your nearly dead body to me. I made sure you were safe. I made sure that you were healthy. I saw the light in your eyes and I saved you! I'm the one who deserves you. You gave yourself to him. That's why Jake had to die! Oh! Somebody call the police! Somebody! Somebody call the police! He's trying to kill me! Somebody! Okay. Just hold still. Ah! Okay. That's it. No, that's it. That's it, Sarah. That's it. Everything's gonna be just fine. You'll see. You'll see. You'll make it. We're almost there. We gotta get her stabilized. She's in and out. There's something swimming in her system. I can't tell what it is. She's lucky you were on the scene, doc. Listen, everything's gonna be okay. I called ahead to my crew, okay? They're gonna be waiting for us. You can either live because of me or you can die because of me. What happened? She refractured her left leg falling down a set of stairs. What about you? What happened to your face? Nothing! Don't worry about me! She shattered her femur! There's no distal pulse! Prepare for amputation. Yes, doctor. She's fractured her leg. Unfortunately, she had a nasty fall and it wasn't completely healed. So we're gonna have to amputate... What's going on? What happened to your face? This isn't about me, okay? Goddamn it, Randall, would you put her under? She doesn't want to comply, doctor! Do your job, nurse! Would somebody please hold her down? I... Would you help me? I am trying to save her! Hold her down! Would somebody hold her down, please? She's cut the anesthetic line! Give me that! Oh, my hand! Stay away from her! I'm in charge here! Get out of my way! Gary, for the last time, what are you doing? He killed Jake. He killed Rosalind. No, Hodge! She's my patient! Do you guys get it? I saved her life! She's mine! She owes me! I did what I had to do to protect us! I couldn't let anybody get in between us! I... I had to kill them. Look at the tapes in the physical therapy room. Jake had cameras everywhere. It'll show you what happened, What he did. Nurse! We need a Code White right now! Gary, I'm asking you to drop the scissors and step away. Do you hear me? Well, it's not the Swiss Alps, but it'll do. Hey, need a hand? No. I got it.
