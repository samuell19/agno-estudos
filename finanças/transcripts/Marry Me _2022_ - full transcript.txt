I'll be the one in the veil. And guess who's gonna be one of them. Me! Okay, I hear that she is wearing a Zuhair Murad custom gown with 10,000 hand-beaded crystals. I feel so grateful right now that everything is the way it is. I have a beautiful fiancé who's so supportive and loving and... I feel so grateful for the American fans because they are supporting me and Kat in a very nice way. "Marry Me" is sweeping the country. KAT: Planning the wedding show has been insane. Strike that, the world. Kat Valdez and Bastian are taking their vows onstage in New York City tomorrow night, and then jetting off to a private island where they'll make, let's hope, more beautiful music together. JUSTIN SYLVESTER: City National Bank, bank of the stars, presents "Marry Me." The end of a tour and the beginning of a lifetime. And with me is Colin Calloway, her manager. How are you? I'm very well, Justin. How are you? I'm good. Now, I heard this was all Bastian's idea. Uh, no, no, no, they-they both wanted to give - something back to the fans. - You know, combined, they have a social reach of over 200 million people? Uh, yeah, of course I know that. I'm-I'm the manager. - Uh... uh... - Who's a bridesmaid? What about her exes? Will they be in the audience? They got some people, uh, waiting for me, so I'm just gonna go and deal with that. - Just... - Bye, guys. I hate dealing with managers. ♪ Marry me ♪ ♪ I want you in my life so bad ♪ ♪ Ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma, ma-ma-ma ♪ ♪ Marry me. ♪ WOMAN: Can somebody get this cart? - Can somebody help me? - (indistinct chatter) It's a gift from Pasquale Bruni.

Of course I've got some tickets for you, even if we are completely sold out. I don't think there's a single person in this city who's not clamoring to come to this wedding. Think this is one of my better lunches, but you be the judge. Dad, don't mess up my hair. I thought that gave you good luck. That was, like, a long time ago. I think it was about a month ago. How great is this? Going to the same school together. - Mm-hmm, great. - Oh, and, Lou, you probably won't see that much of me. I know that could be a problem for you, but if you need to see me anytime... I won't. I like the independence. Good. Oh, and you know the student that you're shadowing, Esther? Full disclosure, Esther is in my math club, but I don't want you to feel any pressure to join. I'm not joining. Tough audience. (snoring) (kids chattering) Um, Dad? - Can I go in alone? - Of course. I was just gonna ask you the same thing. If I could walk in alone, you know, for my street cred. I love you! You may be good at football, you may be good at track, but when it comes to math clubs...

Okay, remember, if you sit in the question, the answer will find you. Terrific job today. I love the energy. I'm telling you, if we bring that to the Mathalon finals, we win the... - Oh, Esther, you got a second? - Yeah. How's Lou doing? She good? I think so. You know, she's great at math, so at some point, I wouldn't be surprised if she starts asking about maybe joining the Pi-thons. 'Cause, you know, at her last school, she made it to the Mathalon finals. Really? She never mentioned that. Ah, you know, that's the thing. She's really shy. Oh, not at all. She was telling me about her vacation and about this guy named David. David? My ex's new husband? - What did she say about him? - Oh... It doesn't matter. Never mind. Actually, go ahead. Tell me. Oh, just that he's awesome and no matter what they do, it's always cool - and exciting and, you know... - Fun. - Yeah. (chuckles) - Gotcha. - All right. - Okay. Thanks, Esther. I guess they're going cave diving. - Hmm. Cave diving. - Yeah. - (door opens, closes) - Where? PARKER: In a stairwell, spying on your daughter. - Really? - CHARLIE: We're not spying. We're-we're just watching from a distance. We're not spying. Look, she had a hard time at her last school. I just want to make sure she's okay. So, what, you thought you'd hook her up with the cool kids? CHARLIE: Parker, you're supposed to set a good example as the guidance counselor. I am setting the best example with my look and my vibe alone. Jesus, kids still do the robot? (ringtone playing): ♪ Marry me, marry me, say... ♪ - Is that a "Marry Me" ringtone? - Guilty. What's "Marry Me"? It's Kat and Bastian's new song. - It's everyone's new song. - It's my new song. - It's not mine. - People are gonna propose to it. They're gonna post videos of themselves dancing to it down the aisle. - Are you ready to be jealous? - Yes. I'm taking my new girlfriend Roxy and her ex-girlfriend - to their concert/wedding. - Shut up. Where she's gonna look at me and say... Hi, baby. BASTIAN (over phone): Hi, love. - Did you see my post? - No. You post something? (chuckles) So, do you like it? I love it. I love you. I love you more, baby. (inhales deeply) - When'll you be home? - About an hour. You know there's about a thousand people - in this apartment right now? - (laughing): What? I know. 20 million? (chuckles) Yeah, of course. Oh, my God. This has gotten so out of control. (man speaks Spanish over phone) BASTIAN: Yo, I'm on with Kat. Wait. Yeah, I just... now I just wish it was me and you on a beach somewhere. No, my love. You deserve the biggest wedding in the world. And tomorrow's gonna be the best night of our lives. - Can't wait. (chuckles) - I can't wait either, baby. MELISSA: Where's Kat? An interview in ten minutes. (horns honking) CHARLIE: Look what I just found. Scoot over. (grunts) I was just looking through some old pictures. - Uh-huh? - And look at this one I saw of you, me and Mom in Jamaica, parasailing. We went parasailing? Do you not remember? I mean, to be honest, I don't remember you together at all. (grunts softly) Well, we were, and we had fun. I get it, Dad. You were a fun guy. I was, and I am a fun guy. (takes deep breath) But, you know, it's not just about fun. It's-it's harder than that. It's work. It's... Well, think about Tank. - When Tank was a puppy. - (chuckles) - You remember that? - Yeah. You remember how fun he was and playing tug-of-war with the Frisbee and him jumping around? And now he's old, and his eyes don't work, and you don't know how many good years he has left, - but you still... - Dad, is Tank dying? No. No. I'm sorry, I-I... Tank's good. I got a little off track. I was just... What I meant is that love is about sacrifice and the day-to-day. Um, Dad, uh, can I go to sleep now? Yeah, of course. Yeah. - Okay. Good night. - Okay. Night. JIMMY FALLON: Last time she was here, Kat Valdez, who let's just say is no stranger to weddings... (audience laughing) said she wanted to do something smaller, understated, intimate, with just, say, 5,000 of their closest fans. - (laughter) - I mean friends. Just a simple wedding for a simple gal. - Just like Mom's wedding was. - (laughter) RYAN SEACREST: Hey, good morning, New York. It's 102.7. This is Seacrest with you. ENRIQUE SANTOS: Kat and Bastian fans, it's Enrique Santos with you. RADIO HOST: Tonight, Kat Valdez and Bastian will give it all they got and tie the knot. RADIO HOST 2: Today is the big day.

If somebody explains it to him, yeah. It's beautiful. Oh, today is your wedding day! - (squeals) - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Get it, get it, get it. Tomorrow would've been our anniversary. You guys went out for what, two weeks? 17 days, if you include the breakup. And she dumped me with a text. So rude. Come to the Kat Valdez concert with me tonight. Parker, I'm not a big concert person. Listen, this is a once-in-a-lifetime invitation, and you don't even get it. This is Halley's Comet. It's you wearing an outfit that flatters your body.

Hang up and turn that off. I got to go. God, he's unbelievable. What now? Well, he's going to Puerto Rico. He says he needs to get his head together. (scoffs) Whatever. (sighs) Kat, he was crying. Not helping. (Colin grunts softly) COLIN: You all right? KAT: No. Okay, well, I did a bit of digging last night, and it turns out, out of 10,000 potential dumpster fires, you picked a decent, straight, single father with no criminal record, and get this, he's a maths teacher. - And that's good? - It's great. He's not gonna be a problem. I say we offer $5,000, get him to sign an NDA and let it all blow over. Or... Or? Or I could stay married to him. (laughs) You're kidding. You're kidding. You're not kidding. Y-You can't. We can't. It-it's not legal. We didn't file papers. So file the papers. Wha... I mean, play the record through here. I started something last night, and if I don't finish it, I look crazy. "Er." You'll look crazier. (Kat exhales) (whispers): Namaste. Yeah, we got to get out in front of this. Now, he thinks he can publicly humiliate me? Screw him. This is a manic response to an insane situation. No, we have to change the narrative. All right? I'm not marrying him forever. It's just for a month, a... a few months. Now, presuming the man you married doesn't have a girlfriend or a life, and presuming I can get him to agree, I'm not sure exactly what we're telling the world. You don't want to be a joke. I don't want to be the punch line. We have to embrace the spontaneity of the moment and just say... "Nothing else has worked. Maybe this will." You know what they say to do when your car's skidding out of control, Colin? Close your eyes and pray? Hit the gas and turn into it. Wait, what are you saying? Rethink the paradigm. We're not selling the world a fairy tale. We're taking the fairy tale off the table. That's what you did last night. - That's what I did? - Yeah. Look, I was just trying to help someone who seemed like they were in the middle of a nervous breakdown. We're calling it a break from tradition. A moment of clarity where she picked you out of a crowd and you, my friend, picked her. I don't even know her. Kat Valdez is a legend. Self-made. She was raised by a single father who died before she had any kind of success. Now she's a woman north of 35 in a business that marginalizes women at any age. People love their artists to bare their souls, then vilify them if they go too far. Well, I'm not gonna let them do that to her. - And I'm asking you to help me. - How? Stand beside her for three months. And what does she think about this? It was her idea. - She had the idea for... - Yeah. What if we offered you $10,000? No, no, no. Wrong approach. Offer him, like, a fundraiser. He'll go for that. (chuckling): Oh. Hi. Uh, I'm sorry. Are you two... Ew, gross. No. Parker Debs, guidance counselor. Same school. How about, uh, we host a fundraiser for your math club? Don't answer that. Okay. What about if it's, like, instead of three months, it's six months, and it could be, like, a whole math wing? -(chuckles) -I'm thinking about the children. Yeah, this is ridiculous. I don't think anyone's gonna believe that she's gonna go from Bastian to me. - That's a good point. - Well, the fact is that she did go from Bastian to you. Counterpoint. COLIN: We're not pretending you're in love. We're just gonna say that you're getting to know each other, and if it goes further, then great, and if it doesn't... It won't. Come... - Not with that attitude. - Well, then it doesn't have to. This is about this moment. Managing the media frenzy until things die down. I have a daughter. I don't want to drag her into the middle of a circus. I can assure you, we won't impinge on your life whatsoever. -(clamoring) -How does it feel to not be a nobody? How do you feel about her being so much hotter - than you, Charlie? - Hey, Charlie! Right here! Hey, Charlie, are you gonna go through with this? Where's the honeymoon? Did you get a good look at him? Yeah. He's cute. What? - He's fine. - COLIN: Hey. Charlie, come in. Oh, she's right there. Jesus. Come over, guys. Charlie, Kat. Kat, Charlie. - Hi. Oh. - How are you? Oh. (Charlie chuckles) - Okay. (laughs) - I'm Parker. I'm... I am the one who brought Charlie to the concert, - so I'm-I'm... - CHARLIE: Yep. Basically, I guess I'm responsible - for this whole thing. - (laughter) Hi, Parker. Hey, Kat. Hi. Would you do me a favor, uh, just two seconds, and just say, - "Roxy, you really blew it"? - CHARLIE: Oh. Oh.

Charlie in studio and Kat remote from London. - Kat. - Excuse me one second. - I just have to take a call. - Okay. - Bye, Kat. - WOMAN: Everything's set up... - She's like a real person. - All right, so what's going on? Uh, we're booking interviews all week. Uh-huh. I thought that's what today was. No, no. Today's more of a press conference. But throughout the next few weeks, we're gonna have some sit-downs and B roll and news outlets following us, charting the progress as you two get to know each other. It's all in your email. I don't check my emails a lot. How do you schedule your life if you don't check your email? Easy. I can't do anything between 8:00 and 3:00 Monday through Friday, and I have math club after school, and three days a week, I have my kid. -Beyond that, I'm pretty much available. -(groans) - So, sorry... - Melissa. Melissa, you're gonna have to move The Today Show. What? Excuse me? We don't move The Today Show. We move for The Today Show. He's gonna have to shift his schedule. Okay, I'll-I'll handle it. Okay, I can handle my own life. I can help him handle it. Uh, Melissa, shouldn't you be posting Vitamix? That's Tyra's job. Oh. Right. Morning, everybody. I don't know about you guys, but when I get up in the morning, I like to meditate. I also love to have fresh juice. So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix. I take my fresh greens, mix and go. Okay, look, I hate to interrupt an artist while she's juicing, but we're gonna have to draw a hard line when it comes to the students - and the schedule, okay? - Yeah. Yeah. You're a little shiny. MELISSA: Awesome. Let's take a selfie. (camera clicks) I don't feel comfortable. -I really don't feel like this is my world. -It's natural. It just feels like everyone walking around is, like, a sycophant. Everything in her life is sponsored. -I know, but don't ruin this for me. -No, but listen to me. - I... - COLIN: Hey. - How we doing? - I'm sorry. I don't... I don't think it's gonna work out. It's just perspective. No, it's not just perspective. You see her as some pop star with endorsement deals, a narcissist who takes meaningless selfies, but that's not the full... Well, I mean, is a selfie ever meaningful? I mean... Look up. Look, I-I don't mean to be negative, but I'm not a big social media person. I feel it's kind of a distorted reality. I'm so glad I came to your TED Talk. No, come on. I see it all the time in my students. - It's... (sighs) - MELISSA: Kat's ready to walk. Okay, she's ready. COLIN: Social media can also reach people. - No, I know. Yeah. - It can be a tool. You know what a tool is, though, right, Charlie? - Okay. Thank you, Melissa. - PARKER: Burn. I know this is a lot. Just go out there and be yourself. Myself probably wouldn't be here, but... Listen, if you don't want to do this... Uh, what, then I leave? I thought you said he was into this. - COLIN: He is. - He can hear you. COLIN: Ladies and gentlemen, Kat Valdez and her new husband, Charlie Gilbert. - (applause) - (cameras clicking) REPORTER: So, you think it's romantic marrying a complete stranger? Uh, impulsive, without a plan. But, hey, look where my plans got me. (laughter) So, you just threw caution to the wind and thought... I didn't think, actually. It was a moment. You're banking a lifetime on a moment? No, I'm banking a moment on a moment. Get enough of those, and that's a lifetime. You know nothing about each other. Did you think twice? Charlie? Mm, people meet randomly all the time. At a... at a bar or... Online. Yeah, online, at 7-Eleven. - (laughing) - CHARLIE: Uh... I mean, why is this any crazier? To state the obvious, you got married. Yeah, and... Now we get to know each other. - But not as man and wife? - KAT: Uh, no. That would be nuts. (chuckles) Just for her. For me, it would be pretty amazing. (laughter) Last night, I held up a friend's sign asking a woman to marry me, and she said yes, and I did, and... you know, I did it not, you know, because she was beautiful... - Well, maybe a little... - (laughter) um, but it just seemed like, in the moment, the right thing to do. So, what, you just saw each other and said yes? BOTH: Yes. (both laugh) And that doesn't seem frivolous? Historically, marriage was transactional. It was about expanding your empire, and a woman's value was based on what she brought. Like, "You give me a heifer, and I'll give you my daughter." (reporters scoffing, murmuring) CHARLIE: It's terrible. I know. That's... Uh, you know, I didn't come up with it. But it really was a business deal, and it wasn't designed to be about love, and maybe that's where people kind of get tripped up now. REPORTER: This is your second marriage, right, Charlie? You wouldn't want to fail again. (chuckles softly) Well, you haven't lived unless you've failed, Bill. You should know that from your time at CNBC. (laughter) Listen, what we did was crazy... We know that... but, you know, it was just truly a leap of faith. The rules as they exist pretty much suck for women. I mean, why do we have to wait for men to propose? Why is everything on his terms? No, I think it is time to shake things up. How about this? We pick the guy, we keep our name and let him earn the right to stay. (cheering and applause) - COLIN: That was terrific. - (Kat chuckling) No, no, seriously. Oh, and listen. Don't worry about Tuesday. We'll adjust our schedule around yours. - It'll be fine. - Thanks. I appreciate it. - No, of course. - KAT: We'll try not to turn your life upside down too much. I think it might be a little too late for that. I mean, do you ever get used to this? Just the attention and the chaos and the people everywhere? I don't know. Some days, you barely notice. Other days, you feel like... a panda in a zoo. You should know that up front. Got it. Where you off to now? Oh, London, for a meeting. And I'm off to Flatbush for a dog, which pretty much sums it up. I'll see you at the next photo op? - Okay. - (engine starts) Don't forget to check your schedule. I got it. OMG. He can't even text with that. OMG. Yes, he can. (whispers): But very slowly. Ay, ay, ay. PARKER: You did not look nervous, and you know what, you kind of have offbeat good looks for someone... - Offbeat? - PHOTOGRAPHER: Charlie Valdez! -Charlie, over here! -CHARLIE: What are they doing here? Relax. We're famous now. PHOTOGRAPHER: Is this a throuple? Where's your wife?! Why don't you live with her?! Why are you yelling at me? - I'm standing right here. - Come on, Charlie. - I'm gonna go inside. - What are you doing? - PARKER: Just, um... - Are you now Mr. Valdez? Are you in the doghouse? Huh? (grunting): Gonna be a short walk. Go inside. I'll deal with this. PHOTOGRAPHER: You been kicked out already? The dog can't shit if people are watching. Luckily, I can only shit if people are watching, so if you're feeling lucky... I'm busy, too, by the way. (cheering, excited chatter) ♪ ♪ BASTIAN (on video): What's your name, baby? - WOMAN (on video): Janice. - BASTIAN: Janice. You look so sexy tonight. KAT: I don't know about you guys, but when I get up in the morning, I like to meditate. I also love to have fresh juice. So I like to juice daily with my Vitamix. Could we get a Vitamix? I'd like to juice daily. Come on. Put that down. No electronics at dinner. What do you call that? I call that a nature documentary, so we can travel while we eat. Put it down. So, is Kat, like, my stepmom? No, Lou. Come on. Dad, I think this experience is actually really good for you. Says my 12-year-old? It's true. I mean, you never just, like, do things without planning them. I think it's cool. I really want to meet her. I mean, Parker says she's nice and smart and next-level hot. She is nice. She is... She's an attract... Here, let me get this. Dad, she just hit 80 million followers on Instagram. Okay. I'm not impressed. Talk to me when she gets to 90 million, okay? Lou, it's not real. It's all a facade. You know, they had me wearing makeup. You wear makeup now? Wore once. Never again. Well, you never say never, but I don't plan on it in the next couple months that we're doing this. And you're saying the whole time I can't meet her? I don't think Mom would want that. Actually, Mom wants to meet her, too. Oh, perfect. Lou, you know that we're not really together. Her manager stages things. Look. - You have an iPhone? - Yeah. I mean, it's-it's just for scheduling. They're making me use it. - Huh. - Yeah, bowling, and then we're gonna do a photo shoot, so... Uh-huh. But do you guys, like, talk ever? It's just publicity. It's not real. Hmm. Yeah! Come on! Okay, your turn. Don't be nervous. It's just, uh... It's not a competition. Just having fun. Uh, okay, no. I'm guessing from the way you're holding that that you haven't done - too much bowling. - Uh, what do I do? Well, you... you're gonna want to put your fingers - in the holes there. - Yeah. Mm-hmm. This one, yeah. Get your thumb in that one. - There? That one? Okay. - Yep. And then take three steps kind of... You want to land on your left, and don't be afraid to use those little... A strike is better than a spare, right? -That is not your first time bowling. -(laughing) Yes! Did you get that? - Come on! The old rope-a-dope. - Yes! MELISSA: Oh, my God. I wish I put money on this, because people are loving it. - What people? - Oh, well, this is an Instagram live feed, and 237,000 people are like, "Why is he such a boring nerd?" - Mel. - What? Their words, not mine. Get off the live, Mel. All right. So, we just need a little bit more B roll for The Today Show. Well, I've-I've got to get home to Tank. - Is Tank his daughter? - Stop. - COLIN: Okay. - You have to go? Yeah, if you guys are done with me. Mm-hmm. We're going to a party. You go. Where's home? KAT: Wow. Cool. CHARLIE: Thanks. Yeah, it's a, um... Kat, meet dog. (chuckling) Wow, I never heard that one before. Sorry. That was pretty... ruff. (laughing): You are so lucky that Mel didn't hear you say that. No, I'm lucky Mel isn't here. I feel like you're never alone. What? I'm alone now. Well, I mean, yeah, other than Kofi. KAT: Just ignore him. CHARLIE: Is everything you do filmed? - KAT: Banked. - Banked? For my channel. Just little mini episodes of life. Uh, can-can we skip an episode? Want me to go? KAT: Yeah, you can go. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Good night. - I'll see you. Yeah. - Happy? Relieved. (door closes) KAT: Is this your daughter? - CHARLIE: Yeah. - She's cute. Thanks. Yeah, she's great. Although she is in that awkward in-between phase where she's still my baby girl but she definitely wants nothing to do with me. And you can forget about getting hugs, 'cause it's not happening anymore, which kind of breaks my heart, but that's the way it goes. What happened with her mom? I mean, I'm sorry, you don't... You know, it's none of my business. You don't have to tell me. (chuckles) No, no, it's okay. Um... We were married, and we actually had a good marriage. You know, then, I don't know, all of a sudden, I got the feeling she didn't want it or she didn't want me anymore, and I had nothing to do but let her go. And, you know, statistically, we're screwed, 'cause 48% of marriages end in divorce, so... That means 52% work. - Ah, an optimist. - (laughs) - This is so cool. Can I? - Yeah. And then I think when you get up to, like, second and third, then it jumps up to, like, 67% failure rate. Even if it's one in a billion, what does it matter? It's worth a shot. - Yeah. - Yeah. I believe in marriage. Jesus, still? Haven't you been married like six times? Three times. Not including this. This is four. But the first time was only 48 hours, so... doesn't count. But still, do you ever feel like just kind of, "I'm waving the white flag on marriage. That's it." No, it's like math. When you get a problem wrong, you just don't give up on it. You keep trying till you get it right. CHARLIE: And what about you and Bastian? How long were you guys together? Mm, year and a half. I'd just split from my second husband. He was a music producer who did, uh, my last two albums and then sold a sex tape. - (inhales sharply) - That's not the worst part. The worst part is I thought I could fix things. - (chuckles) - Pretty hard to fix a sex tape. - Right. - (Tank grumbles) Sorry. Yeah, it's just a little power nap. Pacing himself. - Mm. - (Charlie chuckles) If we give him a minute, he'll-he'll restart. - Okay. - But you were saying? Well, this business, those type of guys, they build you up to break you down. But you were already famous, so... It's not about fame. You know, it's about credibility. It just didn't matter how successful I was. They never gave it to me. You know I've never been nominated for anything? And then I met Bastian. And he... and he gave me this. "Sing." What does that mean? It means "don't let them win." Nobody's all bad, Charlie. If they were, it would make it so much easier. But cheating on you with your assistant is pretty bad. (grunting): Okay. Zoo mates. Zoo mates. See, we're not so different, Charlie.

CHARLIE: Ah. - Paris! - CHARLIE: Is it weird having everyone in the world know who you are? KAT: No, what's weird is that everyone in the world thinks they know who I am. CHARLIE: Yeah, I bet. And you're headed home after that? KAT: Well, um, I'm home tomorrow, but then I have that private in Japan. Wh-What's a private? KAT: I get paid a fortune to sing songs to like ten insanely rich people. CHARLIE: Do you think maybe they'd want to watch someone do some math problems? - (class cheering) - (Kat chuckling) - KAT: I'll ask. - CHARLIE: All right, well, I'll let you go, but call me if you're lonely. (ringtone playing) Hello? - KAT: I'm lonely. - (laughing) It's been like 13 seconds. Are you brushing your teeth? - Yes. - Are you going to bed? It-it's like 8:00 p.m. there. Um, maybe. - Wow. - Well, I'm gonna read. I'm not gonna go right to bed. How's Lou? She's really good. She finally agreed to join the math club, which makes me happy 'cause she's phenomenal at math even though she doesn't want to be. Well, maybe she just doesn't want to be you. That's for certain. But it's not really that. It's-it's more that she's afraid, and, you know, she almost won the Mathalon when she was 11. - The Mathalon? - Yeah, the Mathalon. It's kind of like the Grammys for math, except there's like four people in the audience. -Ah. -She kind of froze in the finals, and then some kids made fun of her and... I just want her to find her place. Just give her a minute. Yeah, definitely. Okay, well, I'm glad you were lonely. (chuckling) I guess I'll let you get to bed now. - (laughs) Okay. - Bye. So long. Adios. (laughs) Bye. See you. (sighs): Yeah. (kids chattering) (school bell rings) Okay, after you've completed the prime factorization, identify the distinct prime factor.

Actually, she kissed me. - STUDENTS: Ooh. - KAT: Next. Oh! Uh, Not George. - Spencer. - Don't care. Why is Mr. Gilbert better than Bastian? Well... he didn't cheat on me with my assistant. - STUDENTS: Ooh. - (laughter, cheering) Okay, you guys caught us right in the middle of our mock Mathalon training, which you're welcome to stay and enjoy for a little bit. Uh, Lou, you're up. - (whispers): Dad, no. - KAT: Is that Lou? Yeah. Finally. Hi. I've wanted to meet you forever. Me, too. PARKER: Are you kidding me? They haven't met? - No. - What is wrong with you? - Well, they... - (whispers): You're married. Can we forget about the mock Mathalon? I have a million questions for Kat. Yeah, and Lou's too scared to get up in front of people anyways. Shut up, Jose. Oh, well, don't worry. I totally get it. You know, sometimes when I have to get up in front of an arena with thousands and thousands of people, I get so nervous. (student murmuring in disbelief) No, I'm serious. I'm afraid I'll choke.

The one that we wanted to release after the ceremony. I don't know, Sebastian. "Sebastian"? Come on. "Sebastian"? That's his real name. Look, can I just... I-I know this is a little...
