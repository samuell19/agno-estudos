[intense music] [keys clacking] (male #1) 'What did she look like?' She's little and...blond. Uh, she's 15. Fifteen. What was she wearing when she disappeared? Uh, I-I don't know. She was going to bed. Do you, uh, know any reason why she would leave home? She didn't leave home. Somebody took her. [intense music] Uh, Mrs. Mack, what were your daughter's personal habits? She smoke, drink? - Uh, take narcotics? - No. [upbeat music] Let's split. Where the hell will we go, man? Hey, there's that Paul Newman thing in the Cactus Desert Drive-in. Who the hell wants to look at that old man? I'll tell you, Eddie, as a social director 'you're nothin'.' (Eddie) 'There's always Fae.' Ugh, what? Again? [intense music] [all panting] [chuckles] - Oh. - Mm. [clank] What the hell are you afraid of? There's nobody looking. [chuckles] Is there ever anybody looking? Come on, come on, let's get out of here. (female #1) Okay. Come on, Andy, you can drive. I can't drive. [laughs] You can drive. Sure, Andy, you can drive. Hey, Andy, you can drive. - He can drive. - He can drive. [laughing] - I'll make him drive. - What else can you do? Can you drive? [laughing] [intense music] [upbeat music] Oh, hey, do you know what Eddie is? - What? - He's a Sagittarius. Hey, did you do a chart on Skipper? She's been having wet dreams about Skipper for about three weeks now. [laughs] I suppose you're not interested in him. - I don't. - Yeah, right, sure, sure, sure. - Man, I don't. - Yeah. I really don't. I mean, he's weird and he's too old. Well, then why do you keep asking me to fix you up a date with him? What are you thinking? [laughs] Get lost. [laughing] (female #1) Hey, Andy. Can you drive like this? Aww. Don't. Come on, I gotta drive. - What about this? - Don't. Come on, man. - Yeah, he can drive. - Hey, come on, it's alright. [laughter] (female #1) Hey, Andy. I can also water ski. - Yay! - Mm. [whistles] [laughs] [guitar music] - Hey, stop. Pick him up. - 'What for?' (Skipper) 'Pick him up!' Jesus Christ. What do you always pick up creeps for? [laughs] You going to Darlington? Hey, you wanna do that again? [laughs] Oh. Come on, get in. [guitar music] - What's your name? - Billy. Billy Roy. I like you, Billy. Andy likes you. Norma like you. We like you a lot. Dig the haircut. Ah, you've been to reform school, haven't you, Billy boy? - Hm. - Yeah, he's proud of it too. - What's your bag? - Me, I'm a professional killer. [sobs] She's gone. And she never left home without telling me where she was going. 'Can't you understand that?' Look, uh, you can't blame us for not getting too upset, Mrs. Mack. 'They don't wanna stay home any longer.' You said you weren't goin' out tonight. I changed my mind. Well, what is it with the secrets? I thought we were going with each other. Well, what do you want me to do? I don't want you to do anything. Will I see you tomorrow night? You act as though we didn't even go to bed together. What does that make us? Relatives? [indistinct chatter] - Hey, check out Joe, man. - Hey, Skipper. - Hi, Skipper. - Hi, Skipper. Hey, Billy! - 'Hi, Skipper.' - 'Hey!' - 'Hi, Skipper.' - 'Skipper, hi.' - Hi, Skipper. - Hi. - Hi, Skip. - Hello. - Can we have a raw egg? - What? A raw egg! Get me three cups of coffee and three Rogue beers. - Hi, Skipper. - Hi, Skipper. Oh, there are the gigglers. Are you feeling naughty tonight, Skipper? Um, you're getting a fine, fine pair, Mindy. Hi, Skipper. - Hi. - Hey. Hey-hey, Amata. Hi, remember me? Billy, Billy Roy. - I was in your English class. - Oh, yeah. I remember. I'm comin' back. I, uh, dropped out for a little while. Oh, well, good. Uh, see you, Billy. She turn you on? I'll get her to ball you. [sniffs] - Peyote. - 'Help yourself.' - Where'd you get the lights? - LA. What do you do with so many books? The only thing I ever read all the way through was "Dracula." [beats drum] You're a born loser. I like born losers. I pick them out, I'm nice to them. It's, it's the thing with me. What are you, a winner? Well, I try to hang words together 'in all the strung-out spaces.' [strums guitar] ♪ I kill tonight Billy ♪ ♪ Di di di di di ♪ ♪ Ta da da da dum ♪ ♪ Di di di ♪ ♪ Then bury them out in the sand ♪ [scoffs] What's that? I told you that I killed somebody tonight. You didn't think I meant it. I did. (male #2) Do you have relations with men? I try not to. But sometimes there's a guy who's really sweet. It's so easy, um.. We're both men. We both know where it's at. It's not personal. You're not giving anything away. I'll only be a minute. Good morning! Hello, ladies! Whee! How do you do? [hums] Hi. How's it goin'? - Hi. - Hi. Well, what did they, what did they bring in you here for? Uh, my eyes went bad on me. Uh, but I can still take care of myself. I told them I could take care of myself. Dad. It's all set. Well, I-I-I don't like it. Well, don't worry about it. 'You're gonna be okay here, dad.' Sure, everything will be alright here, dad. Goodbye, dad. Welcome to your new home, Mr. Carpenter. - Morning, Skipper. - Hello, mother. If you just follow me, please we'll get you settled. This way. The routine's really very simple. Rise at 7:00, breakfast at 8:00 and then you can spend the rest of the morning pretty much-- (male #3) Uh, Miss Todd. Miss Todd, I, I wanted to go to Tijuana today. I wanted to go to the bullfight. I-I've never seen them. - Mister-- - And I-I want to see 'em. Mr. Robinson, you'll have to wait for your son to come. - He'll take you to Tijuana. - But he never comes. He's missed the last three visitor's days. Uh, it's an excursion. It doesn't cost a lot of money. If you could just let me have 15 bucks. Mr. Robinson, this is Mr. Carpenter. He's gonna be with us a while. Why don't you show him around? Well, what kind of a place is this, anyway? You can't loan me 15 bucks. Mr. Robinson, I'm trying to be as charitable as I can. Your son hasn't only missed coming he's also missed the last two payments on you. Well. - Hey. - Hey, what? I need my weekly allowance in advance. - You do, do you? - Uh-huh. You ever think of getting a job? Nope. You think the Lord put me on this Earth just to support you? Yes, I do. I want you working, Steven. Oh, not again, please. No, I mean it, Steven. I'm not kidding. I want you to go to work. Now that juice comes to 40 cents a quart, young man. So drink up. Come on. Drink. I never liked that frozen crap myself. I want my allowance instantly. If I do not get it instantly in fact if I do not get it four seconds flat I will.. [whispers] - Hm. Mm-hmm. - Hm. I think you're capable of that. Okay. - Ooh, thanks, beautiful. - Okay, rent. Oh, for Christ's sake. Why must we go through this charade all the time? Because I want you to learn the value of a dollar. Oh, well, I'll never learn that. You know it for me. That's not a very neat bed, Mr. Miller. We can do better than that. - This Carpenter? - Yeah. We could use a little of your help around here, you know. Robbing the cadavers? I'd rather die than make my living that way. How do you think you're living if not on them? We all make our living doing things like that. That's what life is all about. - Mr. Robinson. - Huh? Oh. Hope they have some good bulls in Tijuana. Thank you, boy. See, I di.. You know, 20 years ago, they had a big whore house down there that was that dandy. - Yeah? - Lot of girls. Lot of pretty girls. (Billy) 'Mom?' Billy. Billy! Billy boy. Why didn't you tell me you were gettin' out? I would've picked you up. Oh, I didn't, I didn't find out till the last minute. Well, I'm just a friend of Billy boy's. Well, come on in. Come on. - Let me look at you. - Skipper Todd. Well, what did they feed you there? Didn't, did they, didn't they feed you? They, yeah, they fed us. But you've lost so much weight. He never eats and.. Uh, unless somebody watches him and then and then it's peanut butter or tuna fish sandwiches. Oh, that's a problem among all young people, Mrs. Roy. Billy. [laughs] Oh, Billy. Well, how are things at the garage? Well, they're, they're fine. They're, they're, they're just fine. He'd be there the rest of his life if they let him. I gotta take care of something. Oh, no, no, Billy. Billy, where are you going? Uh, somewhere. Well, I was going to give you some lunch. I'll be right back. Uh, Fred, Fred, talk to him. Well, maybe he just wants to look around. It's been a long time since he's been around, honey. Who does th-these water colors? Oh, I, I take a class at the Y. Well, I like your work, Mrs. Roy. Uh.. Hey, that's Billy, isn't it? [chuckles] That's right. Let's split. Well, it's been a pleasure, Mrs. Roy. And you, sir. - Goodbye. - Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye. Well, nice boy. Yes, yes, a very nice boy. (woman on speaker) 'What was that last thing?' A cheese burger, a root beer a French fry and a fried dildo. (woman on speaker) 'Smart ass.' Sure you don't want somethin'? What are you so uptight about? I'm uptight. Yeah, I know. But why? 'Cause I hurt them by getting sent up there. But what do I about it? I can't talk to them. Of course, you can. What's there to talk about? You know what I smell in your house, Billy? It's, it's the ugliest smell in the world. Just stale dreams. Your man's workin' in a garage. That's alright because that's what he was meant to do. But it's not alright with your old lady, is it? 'Cause she's still stuck with her stale dreams. Uh, dreams she gets out of better homes and gardens. A color TV, which your father hasn't paid for yet. Anyway, she's gonna cool out if she sees the possibility of a still white house and a little black maid. Are your folks any better? [laughs] Hell, no. They're worse. My old lady is part of one of the prime occupations of Darlington. Give your parents away. Ever since I was a little kid I've watched them bring those old folks around. Get them out of our sensitive eyesight because they're wrinkled and need care. They pretend charity and love. But they're murderers. They're liars. That's what this whole society is about. No more civil rights, sheer hatred. (Skipper) 'Spiro Agnew can board it.' 'Angela Davis.' [chuckles] This rat bucket is sinkin' and everybody knows it. So groove. [indistinct chatter] Uh, listen, couple of cheese burgers. Hold the secret sauce, huh? Fetch, Eddie, fetch. Hey, kill, Eddie baby. - Hey, Skipper. - How's it going, man? Where's Eddie going? I think the little dude's just searching for his manhood over there. [girls laughing] [screams] [cheering] Fae! Fae, come here. One, two. [indistinct shouting] [cheering] Anything interesting happening? (male #4) 'Amata just showed up.' (Skipper) 'Just as always, Robbie at 12 o'clock.' Yeah, but, uh, she don't like to be chased. She likes to, uh, do the chasing, man. You think you can handle that, Skipper? - You know it. - Where'd you go last night? I was showin' this rube some sights. Skipper. Okay. You said you're gonna help me make it with her. You would pick the only virgin in Darlington. - Hey, hello, Amata. - Hi. - How's it going? - Okay. - Wow. Great tan you've got. - Thank you. Hey, you're really sticking out in the sun. - Thank you. - Now what's this? Oh, lotion. Here, I gotta give you a hand with that. You don't wanna lose the tan. Oh, sit down there. Hey, Billy, come here! Whoo! [laughs] - 'Nice, nice.' - 'Isn't that nice?' - 'I like that.' - 'Well, if you like some more.' - 'Ooh.' - 'How you doin', man?' - Amata. - Yeah? You know Billy here, don't you? - You're going to. - Yeah, sure. Hi. - Hi. - Here. He's the best sun tan lotion applier in the business. Go to it. Goodbye, Skip. Thank you. [whispers] Jackie, cut it out. Yeah. Okay. Hey, Robbie, uh, Skipper's interested. Why don't you come on over? If he's that interested, let him come over himself. He said he wants to see you. - How much did he pay you? - What do you mean? I mean, he'd have to go pretty far to find that good a pimp. [scoffs] Cute. She's not interested. Say something to Robbie. Um.. Say something, Eddie. Shake it, Robbie! [boys laughing] (male #2) Exactly what are your feelings towards these girls? Well, I could sleep with them once because it degrades them. It...makes them all dirty. The worst thing about it is, is if you meet a chick who isn't bad, you can't screw at all because you don't wanna make her dirty. Oh. 'Nice view.' Jackie, why don't you go over to Cindy's? Okay. You tell mother where I've gone, alright? How does it feel to look down at us plebeians at the bottom of the hill? You actually came to see me without any of your baby pimps? Wow. How do I rate this honor? Oh, I just loved your performance at the pool. Mm-hmm. So you're the one who rides the dune buggy and services all the little girls, huh? Oh, yes. Speaking of little girls, how old are you? - Sixteen. - Hm. Just about your speed, too, isn't it? Ah-huh. Uh, it's a good age. It's a little over the hill these days, but it will do. - How old are you? - Twenty three. Why don't you do something besides hanging around the pool? I'm a songwriter. I'm-I'm gonna mortalize all of us here. Want a drink? Uh, sure. You know, it's interesting to see what turns on all the little girls. - Mm-hm. - What do you think it is? Is it because you're a creep? [chuckles] Or is it because you're dangerous? Uh, it's some of each. Sue Ellen's mother goes around saying that you're responsible for her disappearance. Mm-hm. Well, what do you think? Wouldn't be surprised. Well, I'll do everything I can to keep up the surprises. When are we gonna make it? Who said we were? Well, uh, don't punish me. I mean, there's a lot of guys who'd had the privileges. Unless, of course, they're lying. Um, are your parents home? Back any minute. Ah, well, you can always catch me at the Renaissance. Yeah, I know. [telephone ringing] (Skipper) 'I know Sue Ellen's mother had you guys pick me up.' 'So I don't blame you.' 'Look, I, I've always wanted to be a cop' especially since I was in the, uh, second grade. Well, that's, uh, unusual. Well, you know, I'm an orphan. Orphans have this thing about authority figures. See, kids with parents, they all wanna be Jesse James and the kids that are orphans they all wanna be the sheriff, you know. It's stupid, I guess. God, it's no joke to be a cop these days, is it? I mean, you know, you throw a punch at a lousy commie protesting the Vietnam War those damn dirty kids start carrying signs. [sighs] You know, but don't lose heart because I think the Supreme Court's gonna start seeing things your way. Look, uh, are you puttin' us on? Puttin' you on? What do you mean puttin' you on? We, uh, picked up your girlfriend, Norma. She's in the other room. She told us everything. Everything? Yeah, I mean what you did with Sue Ellen. 'Now why would your girlfriend wanna tell lies about you?' For revenge. Jealousy. Hell, you know better than I do. Women are irrational. But she didn't really do that, did she? But you guys are good. You're really good. The timing and everything, it was.. God, it was great. Look, uh.. There's talk that you're the, uh, drug man around town. Oh, I wish I were. I mean, if I come across any, would you fellas like a little? Look, we've been pretty easy with you so far. What's the matter, don't you like to turn on? I thought you might. There's a friend of mine, Little Mike. Now he says that you picked him up one day and you made a deal with him. You told him that you wouldn't bring him in if he split a kilo with you. So I thought you were users. But then maybe you gentlemen wanna use it for commercial purposes. I don't know. - I think I'm leaving. - We're not finished. Are you making charges? Either book me or let me go. You're playing a pretty tough game, kid and we're gonna get you. And when we do, we're gonna bounce on you. - Hard. - Real hard. It's my pleasure, gentlemen. (Billy) You have to put 'em on with some kind of character, you know-- Dig this. I was telling these chicks that I was an orphan so that they'd have pity on me. Now really, they'll go to bed with you a lot easier if they got pity on you. No, really. You'd be surprised how powerful an emotion pity is. Well, anyway, look, when I was, uh, I was 14 I got into an argument with my adoptive father and that's when he told me the truth. He said, uh, oh, yeah. "You ain't one of mine then you don't act like one of mine." - 'Hi, Amata.' - 'Hi.' - There she is. - Alright. Just sit tight. Dear Amata has consented to be joining us for a drink. [laughs] Listen, Billy, why don't you two go on up and I'll join you later at my cabin? (Amata) Oh. [intense music] [scoffs] Is that your professional blanket? Come here. You're not helping me very much. Does it matter? What the hell did you come out here with me for? Because I was bored stiff. Get your goddamn clothes on. Well, don't worry about it. Nobody's ever made me feel anything. Oh, congratulations. Well, it isn't much of a career for a 23-year-old man, is it? I mean, pulling all the little girls' pants down. [sighs] You know, fornication isn't much but it's about all that Darlington has to offer. And if you can't enjoy that, then you don't really have too much to look forward to, do you? (Billy) 'I didn't know it was you until I took out this class picture.' You were standing in the row behind me. [chuckles] Oh, yeah. I said, of course, it's Amata. It's always been Amata. Remember somebody used to ring your bell and no one would be there? No. - That was me. - Oh. I'd do it, then I'd run behind the car. I was hopin' to get a look at you. But then your aunt would come to the door and I wouldn't get to see you at all. Hm. Skipper said he was going to come but I guess he isn't going to come. It used to become a thing with me particularly at the sheriff's farm. I thought about you, not 'cause you were the most beautiful girl in my class. Thank you. But.. ...you know, someone like in my class. Oh, thanks again. Someone who could be my girl. (Billy) 'Maybe we could go camping together some time.' 'You know, pitch a tent somewhere.' - 'Hm.' - 'Maybe have a sleeping bag.' (Billy) 'It's always..' '...been when I was most happy..' '...when I've been alone in the woods.' Amata doesn't seem to be the outdoor type, Billy. - Hi, Skipper. Hi. - Hi. You have a really nice place here, really nice. But I was getting kind of bored. In fact, I was even gonna leave. Hm, oh, well, you don't wanna do that. We're just gonna have a nice party here. - Is there something to eat? - Oh, yeah? I'll arrange us some grapes. - Grapes. - I was kind of hungry. - Come on in here. - What's in here? Come on, get some of those exotic grapes, huh? What's in here? Well, it is something that'll make you feel very nice. What, w-what's it gonna make me feel nice like? Oh, now don't worry about it. Just makes you feel very nice. - I don't want any of that. - Sniff. Just sniff. - I don't want anything. - Come on, sniff it. Now look, I don't have time for all that. Sniff it. - I don't want it, Skipper. - Sniff it. No, thank you. No, thank you! - Sniff it. - No! No! Mm, I don't want it. I don't want it. Sniff. Come on, you damn broad, sniff it. [gasps] [muffled] I don't want it. I don't want it. [gasps] I don't.. I don't want it. I don't want it. - Don't make me do it again. - Come on, come on. [sobs] I don't want any. - Go on, get in there. - What'd you do to her, man? I gave her some stuff. Come on. What? I don't want her that way. Oh, don't be an idiot. Go in again and take her, will you? Then talk her about nature and the woods. Go on. Ah, [indistinct] You spoiled it all! [grunts] Cool it, man. Cool it. Cool it. Watch it. Cool it, man. You don't know what you're doing. Now you've been whining and bitching about that broad. Now you go in there and take her. 'Cause if you don't, I don't care. That's it. Easy. Easy, Billy boy. You don't wanna get hurt, man. You know what I mean? [Amata sobs] (Amata) 'I don't want it.' 'Oh, please.' [thud] [Robbie whispers] 'What are you doing here?' You know what I'm doing here. [intense music] [breathes heavily] (Robbie) I love you. [moans] I love you. - Ah. - 'Ow.' You hookers are all alike. You steal a man's wallet when he's asleep. - Skipper, that hurts. - Well, I should hope so. This trip has been outlawed in 47 states. [grunts] Ma. You shouldn't have come in here, ma. My God, this must be the end of little Rico. Oh, Skipper, you look just awful. Must be this wholesome life I'm leading. [coughs] You smoking marijuana? [laughs] What's so funny? Marijuana? [chuckles] I haven't heard that word since I was ten. Who the hell asked you to come in here and clean up, anyway? Yeah, well, somebody's got to. Well.. ...one of these days, you're gonna come in here when I'm in the sack with someone. Then what are you gonna do? Serve us breakfast on a tray? You're still seeing that Roberta what's-her-name all the time? - So what? - Oh. That girl has a very bad reputation. Oh. Not good enough for your all-American boy? Well, like you could be so much if you wanted to. Uh-huh. [banging on door] Where is Skipper? I gotta see him. 'I gotta make him tell me where she is.' - Well, where who is? - Sue Ellen. Where is he? Well, why? What's happened to her? What's the matter? She's gone. She hasn't been home for over two weeks. Where is she? Where is my daughter? I, look, she's not here, Mrs. Mack. Uh, you can take a look around. Really, she's not here. You're lying. He's lying! Look at him. I haven't seen her in a long time. What have you done to my daughter? Oh, you son of a bitch! Where is she? - Wait a minute. - Tell me! Tell me! - Just wait a minute. - Tell me! Tell me! - Just a minute. - Mother. Don't you dare talk to my son like that. If Sue Ellen's gone, why don't you go to the police? - They'll find her-- - I went to the police. And they won't do anything! Well, if they won't do anything what do you expect us to do? Now get out of here and leave my son alone! Mother. Now go on! [honks] Oh, hey, it's Skipper. There he is. Darlington's Tolstoy! Well, how's the new novel coming, Sam? - Not very well. - Mm. You just never give up, do you? Maybe I should. Oh, no, now don't do that, Sam because you're our town's only intellectual. [laughs] Uh, sometimes I agree with you. What about you, Skipper? You were one of the brightest students I ever had. - What are you doing? - Freaking out. [girls screaming] - Hi, Skipper. - Hi, Skipper. Hi. Whee! Ooh! Ladies. Oh, Francis, this is your date. Billy. (male #2) 'You feel women make demands on you you can't meet.' It's almost as though I could kill them. Because I can't meet the demands they make on me. 'Makes me feel terrible.' - Why? - Why? Well, we all have a stake in Vietnam, don't we? I mean, those boys are fighting our fight. They're trying to help keep freedom in Asia. They're honoring our word. I can't do anything about it because I'm a.. Freak. [laughter] [laughs] Freak. Oh, he didn't quite believe me, you know but he didn't have the guts to induct me. Psychiatry. What a crappy profession. - I got it. - Hey, wait up. Hey, Tom. Let me have one. Whoo! How are things with Amata? Are you kidding? I love her, man. [laughs] [indistinct chatter] ♪ I buried her out in the sand Billy ♪ ♪ I took her life away ♪ ♪ My fingers around her throat Billy ♪ Hey! ♪ And then she tried to scream ♪ (Skipper) 'That's it. Stay away from here.' I just like to hear your music. You know what kind of a fan I am of yours. You just made murder sound beautiful, that's all. (Skipper) 'Hey, alright, wait a minute?' Now what kind of a party is this? Come on, have some beer, have some fun. Fae, come here. Do me a favor, will you? Billy's girl, she's dragging it. Will you take care of him? [all laughing] - Hey, can we watch them? - Whoo! Okay, what's bugging you? Why did you fix up Billy with Fae? Hm, why not? She's a community pig. People aren't crap. They do have feelings. Tell me all about it. Well, they're not the way you think they are. You know, in that last bus stop my mother runs you know, those old guys keep a picture. You know what it's a picture of? It's a picture of the person that sent them there. That's where it's at. I'm not gonna put myself on. - You're not? - 'Mnh-mnh.' Where are you at? And why do you go out with girls my age? You're trying to hang on to your high school glory? Or are you just afraid to find out that you're like everybody else? Screw you. There's no love? There's nothing? It's crap. You're just, you're living the way you wanna live. Then why did you buy me the boots? I don't know why the hell I bought you the boots. Alright, you can take them back if you're sore at me. 'What are you doing?' Come on in the house. Come on. Come on in. Alright, you don't come in the house, we're through. (male #5) '"Moby-Dick" is the story of the hunt for a whale' 'but it is much, much more.' 'It is a story of revenge' 'honor' 'and self-destruction.' 'I think I mentioned last week the story of the, uh, whaler' 'who left New Bedford, Massachusetts' 'on a whaling trip of three years' 'and his ship was sunk' by an enormous whale, not a white whale. Well, he survived that journey after about 26 days in the open sea and he wrote a diary. And it was from this diary that Melville got the idea 'for "Moby-Dick."' '"Moby-Dick" is written on many levels.' 'It has a kinship to "Don Quixote"' 'and later on' with Hemingway's "The Old Man And The Sea." In-incidentally, if any of you want a copy of that, uh, diary I can get it if you leave your name with Mrs. Roy and $1.95. You got $1.95? I'll bring it in next week. 'The character of Ahab is perhaps one of the most vivid' 'and larger-than-life characters in all fiction.' Hi there. I think Billy's still asleep. Oh, what, what's going on here, Mrs. Roy? This is a home extension course in a novel. We get together at a different house every week. - I'll go wake up Billy. - Oh, no, no, no, no. You're shelling out good money for this cause. You go right over there and sit down and get your money's worth. Okay. (male #5) 'The test of the great novel' 'is the universality and timelessness' 'and the issues raised in "Moby-Dick"' 'can easily be placed in context' 'in these violent times of 1970.' 'I think we can sum it up this way.' "Moby-Dick" possess more than one level of reality because it seeks to develop more than one level of consciousness. 'Now I think our hour is just about up so, uh..' '...for next week, I think we should all have read' 'through the chapter on The Whiteness Of The Whale.' Any quick questions before I'm lured off by industry into a higher-paying job? [laughter] Sir, I have a question. Yes, Skipper? Well, don't you think that Herman Melville was a fag? [gasps] Well.. Any more questions? 'If not, I'll see you all next week.' Oh, you're gorgeous, Sam, you really are. Melville in Darlington. You're giving them the significance of the white whale and they're going home and playing with themselves thinking of the young, handsome teacher. [chuckles] Goodbye, Mr. Goodwin, and thank you. - Pleasure. - I'll go wake up Billy now. Still keeping up the watercolors, Mrs. Roy. Mustn't let that home team down. Why? Why, Skipper? Why are you putting her on? Don't you think she knows you're putting her on? - So what? - Well, listen, man. Who gives you credentials to go around hurting people's feelings? We're all going through the same crap, boy. - Mnh-mnh. Not me. - Listen. Those women are trying. They're pathetic, but they're trying. They've been sentenced to death. Now they are appealing their conviction. What are you doing? What are you contributing to this society? [chuckles] This society? I wouldn't contribute my fingernails to this society. Now all I wanna see is this society out of the way and down the tube. Oh, it's great, it's great. Are you a communist? A hippie? Black Panther? Are you setting bombs on the city hall? Are you organizing gorillas up on the hills? What's your plan, Skipper? I'm a musician for one thing. I write songs for another. Does it support you? Uh, it-it will one of these days. I believe you're supported by the old people's home your mother operates. You know, you're so square, you're quaint. Am I? I guess I am. ...mourning for Eugene McCarthy? I still like McCarthy. Kids of today scare the crap out of you, Sam. I think they're wonderful. The ones who are protesting the war the ones who are going to jail for their beliefs. What are you doing? You're probably the backwash. We're going through a revolution. There's always the backwash. Ones who are going through terrible convulsions because they're dead. They're left behind. You wanna be a one-man revolution but you are the epitome of everything you hate. You're more bourgeois than any of these ladies. And more pitiful. (Billy) Hey, Skipper! Hey, Skipper! Skipper? Hey, Skipper. You ought to talk to Perry about Robbie. He scored her first night. Now you're not serious about her, are you, Skipper? Look, I'm not serious about anyone. Now what the hell difference does it make to me? He turned green. You really turned green! You can do better, Skipper. Believe me, you can do better. Look, I got things on my mind. Okay, I give her two weeks. Hey, babe, what's with Roberta? Do you really dig her? Oh, now what do you think? Come on, give me the jacket. Hey, stud. Listen, you've always had the hots for Roberta. Why don't you give her a call? Man, I, uh, I don't wanna intrude on your territory. No, it's alright. I want you to. Come here. I have a party tonight.. [whispers] Yeah? Here he comes, Skipper. [indistinct chatter] Come on, get out. Go on, get out of here. Beat it, Billy. Just a minute. Okay, now what were you gonna do with him? I was gonna fuck him. - Leave me alone! - Wait a minute. - Wait a minute. - Go away from me! - Just leave me alone! - Stop, stop it! No! No! - Don't. - Stop. Oh, you're driving me crazy. I wasn't gonna do anything. I love you, Skipper. (male #6) 'I got the beer!' Hey, I got the beer! [indistinct chatter] I got the beer! Hey, I got the beer! Oh, baby! I got the beer! Whoo, hoo-hoo! Oh, baby! Hey, who need a beer? Hey, alright! [indistinct chatter] No, I don't real.. I really don't want to. I'm not kidding because.. ...I don't think that it's really right, but.. Because we don't even know each other and, um.. See that girl over there? You know, I don't mean to talk about it, she's my best friend but she is the hottest number you will ever find. She plays an innocent thing, but she is really too much. I tell you. You know, there are sometimes where, like, we'll go to a party and she'll see a guy and right away, you know, these little horns go out. You know, she goes chasing it. It's really too much. Here's your wheel and here's your hubcap and you take your screwdriver, right? You put one end of it right under here and you just.. Like that, and then on the other side just like that and you.. Hi. - No! - Hey. Don't touch me. No! Don't touch me anymore! Leave me alone! 'I don't wanna go to bed with those boys anymore.' I wanna erase it! I wanna cleanse myself! [sobs] I wanna go home! 'I wanna be cleansed!' - She's gonna drown. - Come on! - Oh, hey! - Fae. - Come on! No! - Oh, Fae. - No. - Leave me alone! - Get yourself up! - No, no! - Fae! - Come on. - Fae, cool it! - Come on! For crying out loud, Fae, why don't you lay off those damn pills? [indistinct chatter] [sobs] I don't wanna go home. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Let me go. - 'Come on, snap out of it!' - 'Get an ambulance.' Get into the car, goddammit! Get in. [Fae sobbing] (Fae) 'I don't wanna go..' 'I don't wanna go home.' [moaning] What are you doing? Stop it, Skipper, you can't-- - Get away from me! - No! You don't.. [Norma screams] Oh, don't you do that to me, Skipper. Oh, no, not after all I've done for you. - Shut up. - I took her by the hands-- - Shh. Will you shut up-- - ...and by the legs and feet. And Andy and I, we put her down into the hole. - What? - Shut up. - She doesn't mean anything-- - I put her down into the hole. Robbie! [sobs] And we covered her and buried her. Robbie! 'It doesn't mean anything!' 'Robbie!' 'Robbie, it doesn't mean anything!' Come on, let's go. I'd rather go to the drive-in. Well, I can't stay with you. I've gotta meet someone. Oh, you got a date with Skipper. Mom and dad said you shouldn't see him anymore. Jackie, I told mom and dad I'm going with you and that was the only way to get out of the house. Alright, but if I don't like the movie I'm going to walk out. I'll meet you at Skipper's cabin. Right. [softly] Hey, did you do it? Did you kill her? What do you want, kind lies.. ...or the brutal truth? The truth. I could tell you it was an accident. That we didn't mean to do it. How did it happen? Boring evening and.. ...we just didn't have anything else to do. Nothing else to do? Why do you look so surprised? Haven't you ever wondered what it was like to kill someone? I wanted to know what it was like. Why Sue Allen? It almost wasn't her. It could have been anybody. I tried to call her at first and she wasn't at home. And then I tried three other girls. Three others? You see how they're dead without me? They're zombies. I give them whatever life they have. There's a power in that. I wanted to test that power. I thought how can I test it? And it was only in killing someone. Don't you understand? I could have told you lies. You killed her.. ...because you wanted to see what killing was like? I'm trying to ask myself.. ...how could I still love you? Could you kill me.. ...me 'cause it would seem.. ...the practical thing to do? [sobs] Could you? I could put you away for the rest of your life. Could you do it? I mean, is life really that way? Could you do it? [sobs] Oh. Oh, no. Oh, please. [sobs] [dramatic music] I didn't like the movie, so I thought I'd probably just.. [Jackie screams] (Billy) Hey, man, I'm dancing in there with my old lady. What do you want? Look, how important can this be, huh? You set me up and then you take me away. Just, listen, alright. I want you to do a favor-- Come on, man. Can we do it later like tomorrow-- - No, no, no-- - This was a pretty heavy date. It'll only take a minute, I promise you. That is not gonna.. Hey, hey, man! Wait a minute. - Come here. - What's going on? [grunting] Come on, get in. Come on, go. Roberta's father is a neighbor of mine. He's a good man. I know what it means to have trouble with your daughters. I've had some with mine. Word has it.. ...that Roberta and Jackie are missing. You've been having some conversations with the local constables. [sighs] But now I'm in it. I want you to tell me everything you know. Come here, kid. What happened to the girls? Well, I'm more worried about them than the old man is. You gonna tell me what happened? Well, I'll, I'll tell you what I think. I think we should notify the Nevada authorities. Why the Nevada authorities? I like Roberta. It's not a very gentlemanly thing to talk about. Forget about being a gentleman. Can I take you into my confidence? Yeah, you do that. Well.. Well, there was another guy. Um, it was an older guy. I, I thought you were the only guy. Well, she-she used to see him and then she'd tell them she was going out with me. What's his name? Never learned it. You know, she wouldn't tell me. But he had Nevada license plates. Okay. You better be telling me the truth, you understand? God, I wanna find her more than you do, more than anybody. Look, I wanna, I wanna make that trip with you if I can. We may ask you to do just that. Thank you. Thank you very much. Hey, man, you know who that was? That was Fred Reardon. You better be telling the truth. Hey, cool it, will you? Just get in. Come on. You better tell me the truth. What happened to 'em? You know. Where are they? They're in the back. Just relax. [intense music] Come on. Come on, Billy, damn it. Give me a hand, will you? Come on. 'Just dig, will ya?' Dig, Billy, dig. Man, it's all rocks. Dig it, Billy. Come on, dig it. 'You can do it, Billy. Just dig.' Just use your hands, man. [dramatic music] Come on, Billy, get in. You're gonna kill me too. (Billy) Skipper! Wait, wait. Wait. [dramatic music] For God's sake, will you leave us alone? - I'm guarding Amata. - Guarding Amata? Are you out of your mind? Oh, what do you want from us, huh? I want five minutes with Amata. Please, Mr. Hassin. I wouldn't hurt her for anything in the world. I just want five minutes with her, Mr. Hassin, please? Please. Please. Wait here. Amata. Billy, I mean, you just have to leave me alone. I mean, you just drive me crazy. I love you, Amata. You're my girl. Now you're acting crazy, Billy. I'm worried about you, Amata. I have dreams. I.. I-I-I dreamed somebody tried to do something to you. Who'd wanna do anything to me? - Uh, somebody. - Who? - S-Skipper. - Get out of here! Oh, no, listen, Amata. I love you. I'm trying to save you. I'd do anything to save-- Alright, alright. That's enough of that. - That is enough-- - Oh, you care for him? Everybody cares for him! - If you only knew what he did! - Come on now. He killed 'em! He killed Roberta and Jackie! Skipper! Skipper, you gotta listen to me. Skipper, you gotta, you gotta get out of here. What is it? I told them. - Told 'em what? - About the bodies. Rob, Roberta and Jackie! I had to protect her from you, man. - You're killing me here. - I had to protect her, man! You had to protect her? You had to have that stupid bitch? No, it wasn't like that, Skipper. I was the best friend you had. I was the only friend you had. You killed me. Skipper, you gotta get out of here. You gotta go. They're coming. They're gonna be here. - I'll be waiting for them. - Skipper. Go on, get out of here, you fink. [intense music] [indistinct chatter] Okay, here we go. Hot popcorn! Hot buttered popcorn right here! Soft drinks! Cold drinks! Peanuts! 'Hot combo corn right here! Who's next?' (male #7) 'Ice-cold soda!' 'Soda. Get your ice-cold soda!' [indistinct chatter] Come on. Let's go. Hey, wait a minute, Bill. Hold it. From here on, it is solid rock. Just wait a minute, okay? Now, look, I remember they were here. I remember, I remember the place. I remember the spot, I remember the tree and I helped him bury 'em. Now just wait. You just gotta give me a little more time. You got all the time you needed-- - Wait a minute, hold-- - 'Put those rocks down.' (Fred) 'Come on, put those down.' Wait a minute. He moved them. He must have moved the bodies. - Come on, Jack. - He moved them! - Come on, son, let's go. - That son of a bitch moved 'em! Come on. A monster. They call me a monster. (male #8) 'You've got a visitor. Your lawyer.' 'Come on, Skipper.' I'm a monster. I'm the one they're gonna use to scare the little brats when they won't go to sleep at night. - Keep moving, Skipper. - Alright. I wonder how Skipper's making out. (Fae) Oh, he's probably doing fine. (male #9) 'He's giving them more trouble' 'than they're getting knowing Skipper.' - Hey, Skipper! - Skipper, here we are! [all clamoring] I've been doing a little thinking about your songs. - We'd like to make a contract-- - Alright, alright. That's it now. Come on, let's go. Mr. Todd, this is your chance to make a statement. - Charlie, give us a break here. - Alright. - 'Give a statement, will you?' - Give a statement. I respect the district attorney. I believe he's doing his job to the best of his ability but he doesn't know the facts. Everybody knows that Billy Roy hated Roberta. [indistinct chatter] I never believed that he'd kill her. I mean, I was shocked. I was more astounded that he accused me. I mean, it seems incredible. Uh, God is on my side and I know He'll help me and the whole truth is gonna come out. I really and truly do believe that God will really help me. Alright, alright, come on, boys. Alright, boys, that's it now. Come on. We gotta get moving now. [all clamoring] Now come on, let's go! They have Andy, they have Norma 'and they've told them everything.' What do you want me to do? - Lead them to the bodies. - Okay, I want a new lawyer. Now just a minute, please. The girls are dead and someone has to pay for that. You tell me that you didn't do it. Well, I have my own ideas. There is a way that you can beat a lot of time. They want vengeance, give it to them. You'll be surprised how quickly that can turn to charity. You didn't know what you were doing. It was the LSD. You wanna go to every boy in the country and play it with them. Don't get started the way I did. Don't even smoke grass. See what can happen. You'll emerge out of it a national hero. You can carry it off. Best actor I've ever seen. It wasn't the acid. Oh, I know. Ah, I, uh, know that. I told myself it was.. ...because you could turn me in for Sue Allen. But it wasn't the reason. The reason was I didn't want her to control my life. Let's go. Why'd you fink on him, huh? Why'd you fink on him? Come on, move along. Move along, move along. - Why'd you stop? - Over here. That's a log. No. That's Roberta. - You see those boots? - Hm. I bought those boots for her. She liked them very much. (Fred) 'Alright, that's enough.' 'The other one?' She's buried right, right next to her. Right over there. Easy, easy. [gasps] Oh, my God, Robbie. Oh, man. You see, the magazine says that-that I crushed her head. You-you look at that, you could see that, uh, her skull wasn't even touched. (male #4) You know, it's funny. I always thought Skipper loved Roberta. (Fae) He did. (male #4) God, he-he couldn't have killed her. 'Jesus Christ. What are we gonna do without Skipper?' [intense music] [sobs] [intense music]
