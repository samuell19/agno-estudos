People who are into women egg trafficking mafia Use this drug What does Women eggs trafficking mean? Like how healthy sperms are cultured When man's sperms are weak Likewise, when woman's egg cells are weak They get egg cells donated They culture it with sperms in lab As per statistics 53% in Australia 61% in the US 63% in Spain 30 to 35% in India There is a demand for egg cells Because of this demand Women egg cells trafficking started As per my study In 2004 and 2005 Britain women bought egg cells from European and Middle East countries due to their infertility These countries became famous as 'Fertility tourism countries' Poor women were allured with money Or sometimes kidnapped They were infused with high dosage Menofor and stimulated ovaries Increased egg cell count They used to sell those egg cells for thousands of pounds Doctor, do you think this kind of illegal activity is taking place in India?
