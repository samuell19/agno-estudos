Hi. - Can I? - Sure, I'll make more. What? - Did you go for a swim? - Yes. It was incredible. I'll finish this and make coffee. I'll take a shower and help you. No, get ready, we're leaving. - Where to? - Surprise. Take a shower and grab a dry bathing suit. Okay. Come on! The water's great! Damn, it's freezing! Don't exaggerate! I'll show you cold! What are you doing? It's great! DYING Luis. What are you doing? Did I wake you? It's two in the morning. Sorry, I couldn't sleep. I didn't know it was so loud. - I'll put on my headphones. - No, it's okay. It sounded good. Is it new? Well, yeah, I was trying stuff. Okay, I'm going to bed. Keep playing if you want. Okay, darling. I'll be right up. Not going out? With this rain? I was waiting to see if it would stop, but it looks like it will rain all day. We should go on vacation sooner next year, in August. The same thing happens to us every year. What's wrong? What did I say? Remember the tests I had done? That were fine? Yes, of course. Well, they aren't. I didn't want to spoil our vacation and I lied. What? I lied to you. They're bad. Eva's brother is a doctor. He knows tons of specialists. Yeah, but it won't make any difference. I don't know. I can call and have them run more tests. I don't see it. What don't you see? Running around everywhere with this like my dad did. It's not about running around, it's about finding a solution. No, it's about living the time I have left the way I want to. Sweetheart... I knew this would spoil our vacation. Yes? - Hello, excuse me. - Hello. I saw the "for sale" sign outside, but I called the number and got a weird signal. Well, I don't know. It's a friend's house and he let my girlfriend and I stay here a few days. - I think he's living in France. - Oh, okay. Anyway, since I saw people here... Do you know how to locate him? Marta. Yes? Are you okay? Yeah, I'll be right out. It was some guy asking about the house. If we had Sergio's phone number. - No idea, I didn't hear. - He'll come back. Are you okay? Kind of. Marta, I'm exhausted. We'll talk about it later, okay? You don't mind? - Good morning. - Hello, good morning. 5.50. This... and some chewing gum. - And a lighter, please. - Here. It turned out to be a gorgeous day. You could have waited for it to stop. I felt like going out. Should we make the most of it and go for a walk? To the rocks? I don't know. Okay, if you feel like it. Let's try to enjoy these days, right? Are you okay? It's pretty. Yeah. Should we go up there? No, you go ahead. We're not going to talk? - About what? - What do you mean, about what? Sweetheart, I already told you. I don't want to die in a hospital. But they could cure you too, right? Not according to the statistics. The statistics. What I think doesn't matter? I'm saying it for you too. Were you saying goodbye or what? What? Before, in the rocks. Did we come here so you could say goodbye to the landscape, to life? I'm cold. Relative of Luis Colis? Yes. Come with me, please. Come with me. Hi, darling. Everything went well. The worst part is over. They cut my hair. What? They cut my hair... on that side. Well, I'm sure you look very handsome. I'm thirsty. Give me water. I'm very thirsty. Water... Okay, wait, wait. Excuse me. He says he's very thirsty. No, no, no. He can't drink yet. But don't worry, he's completely hydrated. We're giving him serum. I'll take care of him. It's best if he rests now. They'll move him upstairs tomorrow. But don't worry, they'll call you to let you know. Thank you. I'll be here tomorrow first thing, okay, sweetie? Here you have him, taking a nap. Thank you. Hey. Luis, are you okay? Take it off. Take what off? There's something on my head, take it off. Wait. Luis, there's nothing there, just the bandage. It really hurts, I feel pressure... Holden, I'll call a nurse, okay? The painkillers are probably wearing off. It's normal to feel discomfort. It's not discomfort, it really hurts. It hurts more than ever, damn it. What's up, Luis? It hurts, please give me a painkiller. We gave you one only an hour ago, you don't get another until 3. Yeah, but my head is exploding... Don't touch the bandage, all right? Don't worry, I'll check the instructions your doctor left to see if I can give you something else. Stay calm and try not to move your head. What time is it? Eleven twenty. - You want some water? - No. The light. Inside. Inside. Outside. Inside. Have you noticed a loss of strength in any part of your body? No. Raise your right arm. Push. Okay, okay. Great, Luis. This is going superbly. Then everything went well? We have to wait for the biopsy and for the swelling to go down in the area. We'll do another MRI to have more information. For now, I've modified his medication pattern to make these first few days more bearable. Okay. - Thank you, doctor. - Thank you. - Good news, huh? - Yeah. Well, we have to wait for the next MRI. Yeah, but the operation was the complicated part and it's okay. Yeah, that's true. All my reflexes are working. - Yes? - Cleaning. I'll take advantage and step out. I won't be long. - Good morning. - Good morning. Carlos. How are you? Yeah, sorry. I couldn't get out until now. Some friends came to visit her. Well, she's upstairs now and things are looking good. I think a week or two, tops. No, tell me. Well, if they could wait a little... Right. Well, I'd like to finish it, since I started it. Sure. No, listen, look. Here's what we'll do: you handle the suppliers and forget the rest, I'll take care of it. Okay. Great. Yeah, yeah. She's a strong woman, yeah. Fine, great. Keep me posted, okay? Okay, we'll talk later. Thanks, Carlos. A kiss. Bye. Scrambled eggs with leeks and boiled fish. Pass me the eggs. - Bread, water? - No. Here. You eat the fish, I won't want it. Give me the apple. At least they don't cook that. I can do it. Damn, it tastes like plastic. You're exaggerating. This isn't so bad. You wouldn't last two days eating this crap. Well, I was only trying to... Then stop trying. Stop acting like this a fucking vacation, it's not. What time is it? Two o'clock. Eighty-two. Twenty-six. Twenty-one. Four. Forty-three. Fifty-six. Twenty-three. Thirteen. Thirty-six. Eighty-seven. Twenty-seven. Seventy-eight, seven, eight. Bingo! Bingo, ladies and gentlemen. Comparing bingo to series 26. 7, 12, 17, 23, 30, 33. 49, 53, 58, 62, 67. 76, 78, 82, 87. Correct bingo. Any more bingos? Have you got a cigarette? Why don't you play? What? Bingo. Why don't you play? You didn't buy a single card. I don't know how. I only wanted to have a drink. Why have a drink in a bingo hall? Why not in a bar? I don't know. You want to go back in? I'll buy you another drink. I have money. Shit! Doors closing. Going up. Fourth floor. Doctor? I'm done. Can you dress yourself'? I'll try. - Are you feeling dizzy? - No, I'm okay. Great. Let me know. Okay. Maybe now. Let's see, we're almost there. - Can you hold the towel? - Yes. That's it. Have you got any deodorant? Yeah, in the toiletry kit. Right there. Great. Okay, raise your arm. It's cold. - Want some of this? - Okay. It smells good. "Espiral." I'll write it down for when I have a boyfriend. And your pajamas. Here, lean on me. That's it. Come on, you're doing great. Let's see... Okay, we're all set. Now let's walk slowly. Easy, I've got you. - Good morning. - Hi. Hi. He took a shower all by himself. What a change! - The armchair? - Yeah, I'm feeling dizzy. Thank you. That's great! You showered all by yourself. You smell great. Can you draw the curtains? I want to rest a bit. What did the doctor say? I overslept and... Same as always. He didn't mention the MRI? No, they're doing it this afternoon. - That's great. - Yeah, great. Marta, can you please draw the curtains? Did you bring my headphones? Damn it, sweetie, I'm sorry. I found them, but I left in a rush and... - Right. - I forgot them. Maybe you didn't even make it home. What? You're wearing the same clothes as yesterday. - Luis, I didn't even notice. - Right. It's awesome. What about the tartare? You haven't touched it. Don't worry, it's not going to stay here. I was thinking that, now that I'm home, maybe you could go back to work. Everything's fine, sweetie. Don't worry. That way you can take a vacation whenever you want. And if all goes well, in spring we could go see the Sakura, in Japan. You have to do these things while you can, otherwise... Thank you. - Here we go. - Okay. Filthy rat, despicable animal scum of life, hideous freak "Two-legged rat." - This isn't a version. - Yes. It is. - Okay, my turn. - Wait. - Don't look. - No. - What? - It's easy. Which? "Heroes." - By? - Bowie. This version is good. Damn, I thought I'd never get home. How about sleeping in your own bed? Wonderful! It felt too big for me lately. You'll sleep great tonight, you'll see. Can you please pass me a towel? Here. - Sorry, it was too far. - That's okay. Luis. We knew this phase was difficult, but we will get through it. - "We?" - Yes, "we." Please, get out. Can you pass me my sweatshirt? - Which one? - That one. I ordered food. Marta. Alex? Luis isn't here, right? No... He isn't back yet. I've been calling him for weeks and he won't answer or call me back. Well, you know how he is. Yeah, but if he was going away, he could have let me know. He has my stuff and he knows I play with other people. Right. I need to leave this for him. I'll check and see if he has my pedal, I need it. No. Marta, it's me. I don't know, Alex. You don't know what? You know he doesn't like people going through his stuff. He'll be upset with me, try to understand. Yeah, but it's my stuff, my pedal. You try to understand. Wait here a second. I just mapped, the floor is wet. Okay. Yes? Is this it? Yeah. Ä°t was right there with Luis' things. He might have left it there in case you came. Anyway... If you talk to him, tell him to call me, okay? Of course. Are you okay? Yeah. - Bye. - Bye, Alex. And sorry. Hello. Here's your order. - How much is it? - 18.70. - It's fine. - Thank you. Bye. I'm sorry, I didn't think anyone would come over. I can't take this, Luis. I almost had an attack. I don't want people to see me like this. I'm only asking you to understand. Besides, fuck him. It's broken. What is? The pedal. I broke it. Shall we eat? No, I'm not hungry. Not even a little broth? It'll do you good. I don't feel like it. I'm tired, I want to sleep. I'm going out. You need anything? No. Where are you going? I don't know, for a walk. I've got my cell phone. I won't be long. Bye. Carlos. Fine, fine. Yeah, well... Getting better, yeah. Listen, I was thinking of stopping by the studio so I can see you all and bring some work home. Why's that? There won't be anyone there? Oh, well, even better, yeah. If that's good for you. Yeah? Okay, then I'm on my way. Okay, see you in a few. Bye, Carlos. It turned outnice, huh? You can tum it off, Carlos. Thanks. When was the last time they came? A couple days ago. Well? Were they happy? Very happy. They're going to open another one at the end of the year. Seriously? How cool. - I can set up the project for them. - Of course. How is your mother? Fine, better. I think she'll be getting out of the hospital soon. Cool, I'm glad. What are these? Do you like them? No. The ones I picked out were nicer, weren't they? More elegant. These... - It's a question of taste, right? - Yes, it is. But the client's, not ours. He approved them. Yeah, but they weren't so happy with the other ones and they asked me to change them. You were already on leave. And did you pick them out? Yes. Well, looking more closely, they're not so bad. They're pretty. They're Pretty, Yes. Okay, I can't do everything. You're busy enough without having to do someone else's job. Marta, I'll call you next time this happens if you want. But I don't know, since you're busy with your mother... Yeah, it's okay, Carlos, really. Everything is fine. I'll be back soon anyway. Don't worry about it, it's fine. Do you know if there will be any other changes besides this? No, just this, nothing else. Okay. Luis. How are you? No, I was just calling to see how you were. I have a couple more things to do and I'll head home. I don't know, like in half an hour. Okay. If you're hungry, there's broth. You can heat it up. Okay. Yeah, I won't be long. Okay, a kiss. Bye. Hello? Luis? Luis? Luis... Luis, are you okay? Luis. Luis... What's wrong, darling? The siren. Hold on. The siren! Thank you. Marta. What is it, darling? Don't leave me again. Don't worry, sweetie. It's okay, I'll change it. Aren't you sick of this by now? Well, yeah, a little, actually. Just like you are. I have to go to the pharmacy. Do you want to sleep a little more or go out on the terrace? I'll go with you. Are you sure? Yeah. Unless you'd rather be alone. No, whatever you want. I just didn't think you'd feel like it. Don't sell the car, eh? Keep it. It's a good car. It outlived my father and it'll outlive me. I'll be right back. 18.30. I'll drive. Marta, I'm fine. One last time, while I still can. I don't know, Luis. To the crossing. No, too many curves. To the tanks and promise me you'll stop. Okay, I promise. Luis, the tanks. Sweetheart, you promised me. Stop. Marta, I'm fine. Whose version is this? No idea. "Voyage Voyage," but I don't remember the group. Luis, the crossing. Luis... Stop. Brake. Stop, stop, stop! Luis, stop! Stop, damn it! I'm sorry. Hi. I'll change and make lunch. Where were you? Running. You took a long time. Yeah, I went for a swim after. Must have been freezing. Yeah. But I felt like a swim. How brave. What? How brave. Yeah, Luis. Very brave. Are you laughing? You don't think I'm brave? It isn't brave to help you with everything for almost a year? Nobody asked you to. They didn't? And who would've taken care of you? You haven't even dared to tell anyone you're dying. And I've had to put up with all your crap all by myself. Don't worry, it's almost over. You're sick of this, right? Then leave if you want. Excuse me, do you know what time the bus ticket office opens? The bus doesn't come until 5 on Sunday. It opens half an hour before. A rum and Coke. No, not until noon. Only wine and beer. Then wine. - I'm going out to smoke. - Two euros. Excuse me. - Can I have a light? - Sure. - Keep it, I have another. - Thanks. I've seen you some mornings on the beach. What? - You go swimming, right? - Yes. I surf. I've seen you a few times. - Can I sit down? - Um... yes. I'm Enrico. Marta. Are you on vacation? No. Not exactly, no. Well then? Are you okay? Hey... Are you okay? Take it easy. I don't know what I'm doing here. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. I have to go. - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes. Thanks for the lighter. Luis? Luis. Are you okay? Does it hurt? Where were you? In the backyard talking on the phone. Who were you talking to? My mother. Can you stay... until I fall asleep? Of course, sweetheart. I'll stay here with you. And the man... at the door? The man at the door already left. A while ago. Marta. Marta. Are you okay? It's time. I'm scared. Call an ambulance. Please, call an ambulance. I don't want to die. It's okay, darling. You're not going to die.
