Give our friend a chair. Frank, I need you to do what he says. Now, listen, fellas, I've got a problem. You know, I like this guy. I really do. But I'm in a bit of a dilemma. My merchandise has gone missing. And when I lose my merchandise, to make me feel better, I have to kill somebody. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, hey, hey. Longevity-- Not a word synonymous with the cocaine trade. I mean, look what happened to Pablo Escobar. Things weren't really supposed to turn out this way. ♪ Welcome to the ghetto life ♪ ♪ Whatever happened to the yachts and the bankroll? ♪ ♪ A $10 million spot with the Range Rover ♪ ♪ 1 woke up and hit the pot and the llello ♪ ♪ Like I -- forgot what I came for... ♪ I moved to the City of Angels to follow a dream. Like anything else, there is a twist. I was following the dreams of others-- The party goers, the would-be actors, the directors, executives, the pariah, and the hopeful, all hoping to raise their position in the food chain. Most of them didn't even know the rules of the game they were playing. ♪ But until that day ♪ ♪ I'm gonna keep on hustling ♪ ♪ So I can live a better life ♪ ♪ Where everything will be all right ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh ♪ ♪ Hustling and trumping to survive ♪ ♪ Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh ♪ ♪ Welcome to the ghetto life ♪ ♪ Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh ♪ ♪ Smoking -- all day and night ♪ ♪ Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh... ♪ So, here comes the Sandman with his wonderful bag of tricks-- The dream smuggler, the only one who can make things happen. At first, I bought a strip joint. Made it cool and very private. See, the more hidden it was, the more people lined up at the door. But then came the drugs, a great trade with plenty of opportunities-- Self-employed, tax-free. You turn into your own island, a fiscal paradise surrounded by white sand and beautiful girls. Still, it wasn't enough. I needed to anchor myself to reality, to not become like those zombies who crawl out at night hoping to get cast in the next big thing. ♪ Everything will be all right ♪ ♪ Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh... ♪ So I found myself a sweetheart, the drug-free girl next door. Still living with her parents and studying hard at college. Hot in bed, but without that whole edge of despair. The only one where the I word would actually spell love. Call her my dream or my anchor. Call her the sweet temptation of reality. I call her Ashley. And for us to have any kind of future, I had to make sure that Eddie and I could step up our operation. ♪ Smoking -- all day and night ♪ ♪ Hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh, hey-oh ♪ ♪ Welcome to the ghetto life...♪ All right, son. What have you got for me? What the fuck is this? Where's my money? That's it. That's everything. No, that's nowhere near everything. - Where's my money? - That's it. That's it? One minute. Ah, the girlfriend. Hello, sweetheart. Yes. Dinner tonight for two. Yes, of course. I'd love to. Okay, love you, too. Bye. Sorry about that. Where was 1? Ah, that's right! Where is my money? That's it, man. I swear. You fucking wee runt. You runt! Where is it? That's it, man. It's all watered down, man. I can't move it. I mean... you guys used to have the shit, man. I can't push it. You gotta tell Frank. Don't you tell anything to Frank. I don't want him hearing anything of this. You understand? I gotta tell Frank. He's my boy. I'm looking out for business, man. Oh, you're looking out for-- You're looking out for business, ain't ya? Looking out for-- you're not fucking looking out for business! I will kill you permanently! Do you understand? You get me my money now! - Yes? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good boy. Now fuck off! You ever gonna get tired of holding his cock? What the fuck you talking about? You and Madsen. Every time he wants to take a piss, he just calls you up, you run over, and you hold his tiny little cock. He's fucking you, mate, and you know it. Fuck you, Eddie. - All right. - No, no, fuck you... 'cause he's fucking you right up the arse and he's laughing all the way to the bank. Get the fuck outta here. All right, all right. Take it easy. No, no, no. This dude's disrespecting me. Yeah, 'cause he's telling the truth, Tony. Look, there's an opportunity for us to make a hell of a lot more money. Talk to Madsen. See if he'll let us run more weight on consignment. He's not gonna do that. Yes, he will. He listens to you. Look, you don't think we can sell this shit? We cut you in on the street level, then that's a hell of a lot more in your pocket than Madsen's ever gonna give you. - You know that. - I don't know. He ain't got the minerals, son. He ain't got the minerals. All right, all right, Eddie, we get it. Come on, Tony. What do you say? I'll talk to him. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, I said I'd talk to him, didn't I? Attaboy! Scottish prick. You think he's gonna talk to him? No. Frank, I told you 6:00. You know how my family is with punctuality. - I know, I know, I know. - What happened? The traffic, it's just-- I'm sorry. It's okay. I'm happy you're here. Come on, let's go. Wait, wait, wait, wait. So, what's the deal? Are they just sitting there waiting for me to eat? Yeah, they are. Okay. Are you nervous? What? No. - You're nervous. - No, no. Yeah, I'm nervous. Okay. Oh, babe, come on. It's gonna be fine. Let's go. Don't worry about it, please. Everybody, this is Frank. Hi. How you doing? - Have a seat? - Yeah. This is me? I'll, uh... Thank you. This looks great. Madsen. - Oh, hey, man. What's going on? - What's up? How you doing, man? Good? - Uh-huh, good stuff here. - Look at this. - How's it look? -That's what I'm talking about, man. You guys have been drinking, huh? - Yeah. - I'm gonna grab one, too. - You need anything? You're the best. - Yeah, why not? I gotta say, I really appreciate you bringing me on this case, sir. I mean, working with you is something we all talked about at the academy. - Oh, yeah? - Absolutely. The stuff you did with the Mexican cartels is legend. Over 40 indictments? 48, but who's counting? So, I hear the local PD is all over this case already. Should we clear out the scene before they taint it? No, there's no need to ruffle any feathers. No sign of forced entry. It's definitely somebody they knew. Minor struggle. Two bodies. Time of death-- 6:00, 6:30 A.M. This your first double homicide? Yeah. - You okay with blood? - Yeah. Well, if you can hold your breakfast down, I'll buy you a burger later. Rare. Who killed you, Madsen? Maxwell, DEA. Oh, as much money as these guys make, you'd think they could splurge for some decent coffee. Maxwell, DEA. - You're the first on the scene here? - Yeah. What makes you think these guys had money? The Rolex watches they're wearing. Anything else? Well, there's no furniture in the place. We got two bodies, drugs everywhere. No witnesses. Nobody knows who they are. Any theories? Well, it sure as hell wasn't domestic violence. A deal gone bad. Oh, you guys are sharp. Well, Detective, thanks for your work. We're gonna take it from here. So, you expect me to walk away from a double homicide? It's a double homicide in an ongoing federal investigation. You're gonna have to. If anything surfaces that may be beneficial to the investigation, please call. Other than that, stay out of our way. Did you just get your driver's permit? Haraday, let's go. Put the card back in your diaper, kid. H "Ongoing"? Whoo. What the fuck? Hey! Hey! Come here, fucker. - Why'd you kill Madsen? - I didn't. - Bullshit. - I was here for a score. - Who killed him? - I don't know. Everyone was dead when I walked in. And then you pulled up, so I hid. You all right? What the hell happened? We got into a little wrestling match. He got my backup. He tried to shoot me with it. I put two in his chest. I heard four shots. Yeah, well, I was never fucking good at math. I want a report. This is your federal investigation. You do the fucking reporting. - Freeze! Police! - Jesus! Whoa, whoa, whoa! Jesus! It's me. - What the fuck? - Frankie, Jesus. You stupid wanker. - I could've shot you, mate. - You didn't hear me yell "police"? So fucking what? "So fucking what"? You gonna shoot a cop? You can't shoot a cop, man. What are you, nuts? Come on. You're cray-cray. I'll give you this, Frank-- your fucking timing's impeccable. - Open it. - What is it? Just open it. Holy fuck. He actually went for it? Mate, I cannot believe this. That fat fuck never does consignment. Christmas came early. How much does he want? - Can I have this? - Mm-hmm. Frank? How much of a cut does he want? Ahem, um... I killed him. What? Did you just say you killed him? God, Eddie, you know... you just really shouldn't wear fur, man. I mean, that's just cruel. I like fur. - It's really hot. - Yeah. Fuck them rabbits. Remote control. No, I'm watching cartoons. - Give me the remote control. - Jesus. I'm watching-- fuck. Girls, get in the fucking room, please. Fucking asshole. Will you girls get in the other fucking room? - Fuck you. - Jesus. Pussy bitch. You find that funny, do you, Frank? I wasn't laughing about that. Why would you kill Madsen? He's our fucking supplier, Frank. We spoke about this. We needed to get rid of the middleman. Yeah, we talked about it. We talked about partnering up, getting a better deal, get a bit more of the action. I didn't say go bloody shoot him. Yeah, well, you know, I did try talking to him and he didn't listen. So you just killed him? He disrespected me. Oh, he disrespected you? Why didn't you say that in the first place? That makes this so much better, Frank. You do realize they're gonna have our balls for this. No, no, no. Not our balls, your balls. 'Cause I didn't kill him, you did. You want, like, an apple or something? Huh? Oh, Frank, mate. They're gonna kill you for this. Well, if they kill me, then I'll die. But I'm not gonna spend the rest of my life as some nickel-and-dime pusher. I did what we needed to do. So what now? We move this shit fast. Get Vinnie his money. Maybe kick him a little extra on the side for the inconvenience. But when they see that we're delivering the cash, they're gonna replace Madsen and Tony... - Wait, wait, wait. - ...with Frankie and Eddie. You killed Tony, too? Of course you did. What was it, buy one, get one free, Frank? Fucking mental. Oh, Jesus. Eddie, come on, man. Look, if we're gonna do this, let's get in it to the top. I mean, Jesus, man. One day, somebody's gonna come for me. Somebody's gonna come for you, but when they do, I wanna know we put it all on the line for the big money. We're gonna die someday. You wanna die a nobody? I'll never be a fucking nobody. I'm royalty, mate. A direct descendant from William Wallace himself. See, that's what I'm talking about. That's the Eddie that I love. - Huh? - Aye. Except, um... William Wallace got his ass handed to him by the Brits. Fuck you, Frank. Cheer up, man. Look at this shit. Take care, man. All right, see ya. Fucking feds. "Ongoing investigation." Why the fuck do we always have to meet so goddamn early? 'Cause unlike you scumbags, I'm a contributing member of society. What, you still don't trust me? I don't trust anyone. Yeah, well, some people might take that personal. What the fuck did you say? I'm just saying you got a fucked-up outlook on life. Might come back to bite you in the ass someday. Is that a threat? Just some advice. Hey! I got some advice for you-- keep your fucking mouth shut. Focus on getting my cash every week or you're gonna find out just how fucked up my outlook on life really is. What's up? I checked out that cop who was at the murder scene-- Reiley. - And? - I was right. I had seen him before. Turned out we had some people check on that place a couple months back. Guess who pops up in the surveillance shots? This picture's all we got on him? Should I bring him in for questioning? No, no, no. That'll just tip him off. We still got a bead on these two guys that Madsen was selling to? You put a tail on him. - I want these guys, all right? - Gotcha. Hello? Hey, baby. Yeah, no, I was just resting a little. No. No, I didn't forget. T-00. 6:00, yeah. Baby, baby, baby, I promise. Look, I'll be there, okay? Yeah, I love you, too. Fuck. Somebody is in trouble. Yeah, when am I not? I don't get it, Frankie. What are you doing messing with this girl? I mean, she's uptight, she's anal as fuck. I mean, she's high-maintenance. Yeah, you done? 'Cause that girl is the only pure thing in my life. She's the type of girl you marry, you know, start a family with. We're your family. You think I wanna live the rest of my life in this putrid shit? First chance I get, I'm gonna take her... buy a farm. A farm? Have a million babies. Well, I can be pure. Pure evil. So, let me get this straight. You've lost my drugs. No, I didn't, Mr. Scalise. My associates were brutally murdered. Do you have my money? - Mr. Sc-- - Can you get my money? It's-- it's not my fault. It's an unfortunate incident, Mr. Scalise. Yeah, it is unfortunate. Come on, Mr. Scalise. No. Mr. Scalise, I can't go out like that. I just can't do it. Come on, you fucker. Mr. Scalise! Take this piece of shit out of there. And find my merchandise. This is a business, and like most of them, you have your good share of incompetence, morons, egocentric pricks, simpletons. They're the ones who give a bad rap on the trade. You have to stay cool. You have to learn the rules. You have to study the markets and understand your customers. You have to minimize risk and maximize profit. Basic rules, but so often forgotten. Let's be honest. This is a multi-billion-dollar industry. Part of it is legal-- Abuse treatments, prevention costs, health care, DEA budgets, jails, morgues, et cetera. Only a small part is illicit. Less than 20%. Now, my question would be, is it really worth it to eradicate this trade? I don't think so, and I'm backed by the government. Do you have any idea how many people would lose their jobs if drugs weren't around? You think any administration would take that risk to increase the line at the unemployment office? Of course not. The war on drugs is just another opportunity to accentuate the big scare-- Foreign cartels, Mexican smugglers, Russian mobsters. The message is simple-- beware of the foreigners. America... how did you forget your origins? Don't you remember the melting pot? And, by the way, don't you know that the fastest growing drug in the last 20 years is meth? Meth-- pure white trash. All this has nothing to do with morals and the wrong side of the law. It's all about economy. This is a business and a better one than Wall Street. They sell hope, I sell dreams. Most of the time, I sell dreams to the ones who sell hope. We're businessmen, not junkies. We control this world. Or at least I thought so. This is really nice. This is really nice. But, you know, it's not gonna make everything go away, Frank. Why do you always get so mad at me? Frankie, you disappeared for weeks, babe. Seriously, where were you? You see what I mean? Why does everything with you always have to be a secret? How do you expect me to trust you if you don't trust me? Yeah, you're right. I mean, the job I have, the nightclub, the nightlife, it's-- It's good money, but it's not exactly the best for a relationship. You think? I want to sell the club. No, no. I don't want you to do that. You don't have to do that. Listen, listen. I want to. I don't want to-- I don't want to do this anymore, Ash. I want to get out of here and start over, - buy a horse farm. - ) - A horse farm? - Yeah. I don't wanna live on a farm. Okay, so we'll buy something else. - Something else. Not a farm. - All right, something else. But I-- when I see how you are with your parents and your family... And it's kinda boring. It's amazing. It's amazing. It's what I want, you know? A little Frankie running around with your nose. But your eyes, though. Definitely your eyes. Let's get married. Well... if you're serious... ask me properly someday. What's up, baby? Wanna party? Come on. What you got? I got some good shit. Want some of this, darling? No, I don't want some fucking blow. - Come on, girl. - No, I want some cash. Come on. Come on, you take care of me-- come on. Come here. - Fucking get your hands off me! - Come on. Good. - Crazy fucking whore! - Fuck off! - This the guy? - Yeah. All right, you go talk to him, bring him back here. - We'll show him the picture. - All right, cool. - Hey, buddy. - 'Sup? Hey, I've got a couple questions to ask you. Why don't you come back with me to the car real quick? What the fuck, man? I didn't do shit. I'm gonna ask you some questions and you're gonna answer. Fuck you, 5-0. Let's make one thing crystal, amigo. Are we clear now? Do you know this guy? That dude's dead, man. Brilliant. Now, who's moving in on his action? Some guy named Eddie. Big mouth, likes to party. Where can I find him? I don't know. He hangs out at this white boy bar on Melrose and Vine. Thanks. - We're not gonna arrest him? - We're done here. Let's go. - Whoo! - Fucker! Jesus! Can someone tell me how I just missed him again? Oh, my God. You were closer that time. You were closer. Hey, hey. Girl at the bar in the leopard print. She says, "Try it again.” Oh, don't we have a wild one in here, girls, tonight? To taming you, princess. Jesus, fuck! Again? I missed him again! Eddie. Eddie, enough already. I'm running out of shot glasses. Fuck your glasses, mate. Just calm down. Somebody's gonna get hurt. Ooh. - Did he just tell me to calm down? - I think he did. Ralph, Ralph, will you grow some minerals, son? Don't you ever tell me to calm down. Do you understand? 'Cause I will buy this bar and I'll make you the busboy, and let's see how fast you can duck. Now, bring me some more shots in here! Excuse me. Come on over, my dear. Maxwell, come in. It's Haraday. You see anything yet, sir? It's pretty quiet down here. Didn't I tell you to maintain radio silence? Uh, yes, sir. Sorry, sir. It won't happen again. Look, Haraday, if anything happens, you'll be the first to know. Thank you, sir. Won't let you down, promise. Anything you need, just ask. Some soy sauce would be nice. Really? No, just stay in position. Bartender... stripper... - Hi. - ...actress. Hi. But you-- I think you may be different. You might have a real job. Possibly... like, a nine-to-five job. Now, you've got the looks... But do you have the brains? If I had to take a stab at this, I would maybe say... lawyer? - Accountant. - Ah! I knew it! I was close. I was close. Why are you here? My boyfriend broke my heart. I was tired of crying about it. That means you can just make up for lost time. Yeah. Yeah, my revenge period. We're looking for a guy named Eddie. - Scottish. - Is he around? I'm exactly the type of guy your boyfriend would hate to see you with. Is that right? It's most definitely right. - Checkmate. - Cool. Eddie! - There's gunshots. - Get out there. - Shit, shit, shit! - Get over here. ♪ Rip to shreds ♪ ♪ Walk away and live your lie instead... ♪ Fucker! ♪ Say you'll leave him ♪ ♪ In fact, you're never looking back... ♪ ♪ Sometimes I... ♪ Police! Don't move, turn around! Got any weapons on you? Where'd they go? Don't move! - Nice job, Haraday. - Thanks, sir. Move your ass. All right, that's it, let's go. Come on, Eddie! Somebody wants to talk to you! Ah! Oh! Oh, fuck! You doing okay? You all right? I heard better things from you, Eddie. Need a break, huh? Need a break? All right, why don't you take a break? You shouldn't have taken a shot at me, you Scottish prick. Ooh! Fuck! Fuck! - You got a sore hand, do ya, son? - Son of a bitch! A sore hand? How's your hand? You broke my fucking hand! How you feel? You feel all right? How you doing? How's your balls, huh? Good? You all right, son? You stupid fucking wanker. Good night, sweetheart. Wouldn't do that if I was you, Eddie. Aw, fucking hell. Don't take one further step 'cause I will blow his fucking brains out. Go ahead. I got three more. Drop the gun, Eddie. You've been a silly boy, my friend. It looks like it, right? Fuck. Could at least wait till I was ready. Come on. Come on, come on. Fucker! Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, what? - Hon... - Hmm, hmm? - What about Eddie? - He's not home. Are you sure? Eddie, I got a bottle of Dom and two chicks that wanna meet you. He's not home. Maybe I can stay. But not long. - 'Cause I have class in the morning. - You got class in the morning. - I do. - You have to be up early. Teachers are up early. Right. Mm-hmm. - This is gonna rock. - ) - Frankie! - Whoa! What, you don't pick up your phone? You can't knock? It's Eddie. Are you sure they were cops? Well, they weren't fucking wearing the uniform, but they had guns and they were asking me fucking questions. What do you think? What, like, feds? I guess. I don't really know. Think, Kathy. Where is Eddie now? I don't fucking know. Why don't you go find him? - We're going to the club. - No, we're not fucking going anywhere. What, are you nuts? The cops are swarming the place right now. The cops don't give a shit about you, Kathy. You know what? Fuck you. I got company anyway. - It's okay, it's okay. - Company? It's all right, it's okay. Come on. - What the hell is this? - She's a friend, all right? - A friend? - Yeah. And you fucking brought her here? Are you out of your mind? She saved my life. What have you done for me lately? What's going on, Frank? I wanna go home, please. There's an emergency at the club. Can you just take my car? Look, I'm sorry. I'll call you in a couple hours. Can you just do this for me? Whatever. I shouldn't have even come here. Ash, Ash, Ash, please listen. Don't leave like this. What? You want me to be excited that you've got two girls making out in your living room? That has nothing to do with me. Come on, you know that's Eddie's girl. Why are you even with me, Frank? Your life and your friends-- None of this is me. Ashley, Ash-- Hey. He's right in there. Eddie. You shouldn't take the beating personally, Eddie. It's just business, strictly business. - Hey-- - Oh, here's our friend. Come in. What the hell is going on here, Eddie? Calm down, son. Just calm yourself down. Calm down? Who the hell are you? Frankie, just chill, all right? Yeah, take it easy, Frank. And don't raise your voice! Ha. Fuck off. Frank, I need you to calm down. Who the fuck is this guy, Eddie? Hold on. No need for the violence. Our friend here's just venting. And that's just a reaction because you feel threatened and you're scared. But you're thinking with your balls, my friend, which is not good. I need you to start thinking with your head. Give our friend a chair. Frank, I need you to do what he says. Now, listen, fellas. I've got a problem. You know, I like this guy. I really do. But I'm in a bit of a dilemma. My merchandise has gone missing. And when I lose my merchandise, to make me feel better, I have to kill somebody. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hey, hey, hey. Vin, Vin, as I was saying before my friend walked in, we will find your stuff, we'll sell it, we'll fill your pockets with cash. Loads of cash. Yeah, I like cash. But I have a slight problem. I've got two associates with bullet holes in the back of their heads. Oh, I see how that could be a problem. Look, I can't bring back the dead, but the way I see it... anybody working for you, governor, they should take better care of themselves. And more importantly, better care of your product. And you think you can. Oh, we most definitely can. That was for your friend pissing me off. You really should teach him some manners, Eddie. Now, this is how it's gonna be. You find and sell my coke for full street value in two days. Otherwise, I'm gonna come back and kill you and your rude friend. Is that clear? Crystal. Good. Two days, Eddie. Two fucking days. Don't disappoint me. Let's go. Two days. Two days! Two fucking days. Well, that was fucking brilliant. How is any of what just happened brilliant? We're fucking alive, Frank. Your shitty plan actually just fucking worked. You know what? I knew it would. - Ah, fuck. - Come on, come on. Get up. There we go. You all right? You didn't know it would work. What are you talking about? Yeah, I did. - You were shitting your pants. - Get the fuck out of here. You were halfway up his ass with that whole speech thing.

Oh, yeah, the Madsen replacements. What about Agent Royce? She's waiting outside with a full report. Royce, come here. What do you have for me, Royce? I've been able to integrate into their group. I've earned their trust. They even discuss business transactions in front of me. That's good work. I understand that you had to get romantically involved with one of the girls in the group? So, tell me about that. It's all in my report, sir. Oh, yeah, I'm gonna read this thoroughly. You can count on that. I believe that we have more than enough to put these guys away. I agree. We should bust these guys right now. And let Scalise walk? Put us back to square one? Our mission's not to bust some little dealer here. All due respect, sir, these guys aren't exactly pushing dime bags on the corner. They're moving a lot of product. Okay, Maxwell... you put a team in the apartment next to them.

If you can't keep your personal feelings out of the job, then maybe we need to rethink our relationship. Yo, Frank, I like chilling with you and everything, but I ain't got all day, son. I'm here on business. You feel me? I heard you all were stocked and shit, so I'm gonna need, like, a half a brick. Fuck, half a brick, huh? Yeah, I'm steady making moves, man. Going out there grinding and hustlin' and shit. What the fuck are you doing? What? Did I say you could use my blender? No, you were playing the video game. I was fucking hungry, man. I haven't eaten all day. What the fuck-- get the fuck out of there, man. What are you doing, man? Aw, Jesus, you used my chocolate ice cream? - Fuck, man. - There was only a little bit left, bro. - Fuck, you don't just-- - What are you throwing that out for? You don't come in here and just use somebody else's shit. - You-- where's your cup? - You didn't have no cups. I looked all around for cups and you didn't have no-- You drank straight out of the fucking container? That's just grimy, dude. That's your opinion, son. - Fucking grow up, man. - Why you gotta get all-- Why you trippin', dawg? Just smoke that J and fucking play your video games and relax, dawg. - All right. - It's all good. So, what's up? Can I get that shit or what? - Nope. - Why not? You can't just fucking walk in here, expect to get half a kilo of coke. This isn't high school, man. Where do I keep it, under the fucking couch? All right, so, but, like-- You can get it tomorrow. It's gonna be 15 Gs for half a kilo. 15 grand? What are you, crazy, dude? I can get it, like, for 10 anyplace else, bro. Then get it 10 anyplace else. All right, I'll come tomorrow, but can I get a sample? Why you laughing, dude? That's my reputation. I need to make sure that shit's good. You know what I'm saying? I mean, this is my career path. You feel me, dawg? I feel you, dude. So, your reputation better be solid 'cause you are not getting a sample. All right, cool, fuck it. All right, I'll be back tomorrow. - Yep. - Shit's fucked up. Mm-hmm. Stay the fuck out of my fridge. I ain't even going in your fridge, bro. I saw you lean towards it. LRT, dawg. That's what I'm saying. Loyalty, respect, and trust. You're fucking losing all them shits, man. - Yeah, BLT. - Fuck you. That's your code. You fucked up my game, piece of shit. Yo, what's up, baby? Where you going? - Fuck off. - Oh, why you gotta be like that? - Creep. - Come on, man. Damn, you saw that shit? You're late, Scott. Come on, don't call me that, man. It's Sweetness. How many times I gotta tell you? - It's Sweetness, bro. - Lighten up, Scottie. You get what I need to know? You know, I don't need this shit, man. I mean, don't informants get paid or something? Chill out, yo. Ah! Yo, what the fuck are you doing? - Arresting you. - For what? - Possession. - Oh, that's fucking bullshit, man. Listen, fuckface. I don't care about you or your stupid name. If you don't wanna be a snitch, you should've thought about that before you started messing with me. Now you got one choice. You wanna be a live snitch or a dead one? Okay, okay, relax. I'm only gonna ask you once. Who's moving Madsen's shit? - You all set? - Aye. Don't fuck this up. As we know, this is the layout of the apartment here. We're gonna be in here. Anything goes to shit, we'll go out, stack in the corridor, move down here, knock and announce. Garcia, anybody in there, you take 'em down. Contain 'em, okay? Four and five will go bedroom two and three. Then, uh, one and two will move on to bedroom one, right here. Let's go, guys. Frank? Frank, baby, are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. You've been in there a long time. You good? Yeah, no. I'm okay, baby. I'm okay. I'm okay. Come home with me. I don't think that's such a good idea. Are you mad at me? You were so distant during dinner today. If you didn't want to be here, why'd you even come? Oh, come on, Ash. You know that this, all of it, is just stressful for me. I know. Does that mean you're gonna come home with me? - Maybe. - Mm-hmm? This is ridiculous, Frank. Why did we come all the way up here? I like this place. For romance? Are you going soft on me, Frank? Your girlfriend not doing it for ya anymore? Will you shut up? I'm trying to tell you something. Should I be getting worried? I'm gonna quit. Sure. Aw, you're kidding. You're not? Why would you want to quit? Frank. You've just killed two men for a sweet, sweet deal. And you wanna quit? - Well, I ain't giving up. - No, I know. And I wouldn't expect you to. That's what I want to talk to you about. You should just take over. What happened? Nothing happened, you know. It's just... I don't like where this is going, man. I-- I'm fucked up half the time. Doing crazy shit. I don't know, man. It's like I'm losing it. If I don't get out now, I'm gonna do something really stupid. It's time to move on. I suppose with that girl? What, you wanna get married or something? Eventually. That's gonna complicate our friendship. - You do know that, right? - How? Well, what? What do you think I'm gonna do, start coming 'round dressed up as Santa Claus? Bringing gifts for your kids? And them calling me Uncle? It's gonna get to a point, Mrs. Frank is not gonna want me around anymore. So... why don't you try doing what I'm doing, man? 'Cause I'm good at what I do. So are you. This is the last batch and then I'm done. I'm disappointed. Do you remember when you came to this city? I put a roof over your head. I mean, I helped you out, I got you started. What do you want from me? I owe you. So, that's it? This was your master plan? A one-hit wonder and you're out. What are you talking about, man? I didn't have a plan. It's just... sometimes... sometimes your actions just take you on different paths. Well, what can I say? I wish you the best, Frank. Thanks. I wish you the best. Now, let's get the fuck out of here. I fucking hate this place. It's shite. Now, in the legal world, when you turn out to be a poor businessman, you go bankrupt. You may lose your line of credit, your assets, worst-case scenario, your house. In my line of work, most of the time you lose your life. So it's important to have a plan B, an exit strategy. My way out is Ashley. My way out is to build a normal life outside of all of this. I've been putting money aside, and sooner than later, I'm gonna be able to retire. Yeah, I might miss the action or the thrill, but I'll be alive. Maybe have kids. A three-bedroom house with a manicured lawn and a pool somewhere in suburbia. I'll call that bliss. Thank you for this. I'll call it heaven. Babe, I'm really sorry. I haven't been the most understanding lately, and I know you have a lot on your mind. Don't-- don't be sorry. Okay?

Why don't you find somewhere else to play, all right? You're Frank, right? What, are you a cop? Yeah. I'm off duty. Is that right? It's just a job, man. I guess it is. So, Officer Reiley. - It's Detective, actually. - No shit. Why do you know me? Oh, I've been asking around. I wanted to meet you. Well, you found me. Do you mind? You guys got it made here, you know that? Money, women. Why don't you give us a break? Come on. - Hey. - That is a fine ass. You know, if I had it to do over again, I don't think I'd be a cop. So, quit. Yeah, I probably should, but I keep thinking pension. You guys got some hot shit going on here, though. All I do is run a strip joint, man. It's really not that glamorous. Ooh. Wow, that's some good shit. Where'd you get that? - It's not mine. - No? Mind if I keep it? I used to get some good shit like that from a friend of mine. Maybe you know him. I doubt it. Madsen. No? Doesn't ring a bell? He's dead, anyway. You got a point to make, man? 'Cause you're just really killing my party. What, you think I've come here to arrest you? Why would I come up here and do that? I know everything about you. I know where you live, I know what time you wake up. Hell, I know when you take a shit, pal. I know if that pretty little girl of yours knew what you were doing here tonight, well... You talk a lot. No, that's the point. I don't say anything. What I know, I keep to myself. So, what's your deal? Same as you-- Power, women, money. My money. Consider it an insurance policy. You're a dirty cop. No, I'm a smart cop. Yeah. No, I get it, man. What's your price? Oh, I'm sure we can work something out. Yeah-- yeah, no, we'll work something out. What do you think... a hundred? Yeah, right. $1,000, huh? What am I talking about, $1,000? $1,000, that's not even gonna get me a good blow job in this town. I mean, for an officer of the law, it's gonna cost me a lot more, right? Tell me, how much is it gonna cost me for a detective to suck my dick? You cannot be that stupid. Piece of shit. God damn it. What the fuck is the matter with you? Johnny, get in here! Fuckin' Frank, you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - Help me out, man! You come in here and starting shit? - Come on, hold him. - Get the fuck off! Get him, Frankie. I was having fun... until you fucked it up. You come into my club... You're asking me for fucking money? - You piece of shit. - That's enough, Frankie. He's a cop, Johnny. He's a fucking cop. How do you let a cop in here, you fucking pig? What the fuck, Frank? Who the fuck is that? That's a cop. He wants money. You wanna give him money? A cop? Money? - Not our fucking money. - I do. You want my money? Kathy, get me my money. Get me my fucking money! Okay... Here, Jack. Here's your fucking money. You come in my club, threaten me and my friends... Frankie, let's get out of here now. ...threaten my fucking girlfriend. Frankie. Hey, hey, Frankie, come on! Jesus Christ. Oh, my God. Get this piece of shit out of here. You got it, boss. Fuck! Turn the music back on! Start fucking dancing now! Beverly, are you okay? Yeah. - Can you control this? - Yeah. Mm-hmm, yeah. Yeah. Hey. They shot that dirty cop tonight. - Reiley? - Yeah. - They kill him? - No, no. No, no. I don't-- I don't know. I'm putting a stop to this. - You're done here. - No, no, don't do that. - Don't do that. - Bev, you're too deep into it. Evan, don't do that. You can't do that. You can't just pull me now. What did I do all this for, then? Look, I just-- I just needed to see you, okay? I just need to-- I just needed to know that I'm doing the right thing here, okay? Okay, but... if you find you're out of control, just forget about the case and just walk away. Yeah, I got it. Everything's gonna be fine, okay? Just promise me, okay? Just promise me that you'll be there when this is done. Yeah, I promise. - Be careful. - Yeah. Well, Frankie? This ain't good. This most definitely is not good. I'm in the mood for Mexican. How about you? Well... I love Mexican. Let me get this straight. You were mugged? Right. And they took your gun and shot you in the hand. What were you doing downtown? That's where they dumped me. Right, right. So you were kidnapped, too. Tell me again, how many were there? Three. Three? White, black, Hispanic? I already gave a report. Jack, there were traces of cocaine in your blood and "a bag of cocaine in the right pocket of Officer Reiley's coat."” You have no explanation. You can't even give us a positive ID on the guys who supposedly mugged you. If you have a substance abuse problem, the department can help. Damn it, Reiley, you have to talk to me! It's all in the report. Okay. That's the way you want it. You're suspended without pay indefinitely. Damn it, Deb, don't do that. We've known each other 20 years. Long before you fucked your way to captain. Thanks for making this a lot easier on me. I'm-- I'm sorry, Debra. I didn't mean that. I just need a couple more days. I'm in the middle of something big here. I'm gonna break this wide open. Internal Affairs has an ongoing investigation on you, Jack. I don't know what you're into, but the shit is rolling down from a lot higher than this office. My hands are tied. If I were you, I'd get myself a good lawyer. Since you don't have your fucking gun, I need your badge. Fuck! What the fuck do you want? Do you mind keeping your hands where I can see them? You gotta be kidding me. Do I look like I'm joking? Now, why would a perp steal a cop's gun, shoot him through the hand, then leave him alive to talk about it? The world's full of psychos. Take you, for instance. You know what I think? I think you knew the person who shot you. I think they knew you well enough to know you wouldn't talk because you're too dirty to start airing out laundry. I don't give a flying fuck what you think. Do you even remember why you became a cop? Oh, and you do? I'm sure you love running around for 80 grand a year taking it in the ass while some two-bit punk uses your head for target practice. That's the job. You're something else. You're so fucking self-righteous. You really think you're making a difference? You're not. You're not getting drugs off the street. For every one you arrest, three more pop up. The job. The fucking job's a joke. Look around. You'd better face it, Maxwell. Whatever goals you set for yourself in the beginning of this, you're failing miserably. I just want to make enough to retire. Get out of this shithole, go some place tropical. Costa Rica, anywhere but here. You know, my first case... there was this junkie mom out in Nevada. She was shooting up, but her baby wouldn't stop crying, messing with her high, so this HIV-positive waste of a life decides to stick her own baby girl with her own syringe, shooting her up with smack to quiet her down. By the time I got there, the baby was dead and Mom was halfway there. Nothing I could do about it. You know, when I first started, my goal was to save the world. Now, 20 years in, I just want to make sure guys like you don't make it to Costa Rica. I've seen a million guys like you. One day, you're gonna fuck up... and I'll be there. - ) - Frankie boy. You remember a cartoon with... Yosemite Sam and Bugs Bunny? Which one? Sam's chasing Bugs and Bugs runs right into this house. ♪ In the shadows you will find me ♪ ♪ Beneath a veil of agony ♪ ♪ There's a feeling here fhat cuts right through ♪ ♪ Like the soul of a stone-cold stare ♪ ♪ Or the dark of a dusty old cellar...♪ So Yosemite Sam starts pounding down on the door. Right. - And Bugs opens the door. - Uh-huh. But he opens it dressed as a chick. - Hi. - You dating Frank? So, Yosemite Sam's like, "Pardon me, ma"am. Pardon me, but I'm looking for a yellow-bellied rabbit." - Yeah. - Bad decision. Who are you? And then he comes bursting into the house. Where the fuck are you going? Bugs runs to the door, jumps in front of it. "He's not in here! No, he's not in here!" God damn it, get back here. No! - No! - Where are you going? No! No! Boom! This big cannon just blows him away, right? So, at that point, Bugs runs to another door. "He's not in here! He's not in here!" And Sam's still buying this? You fucking crazy? What the fuck is the matter with you? So Sam runs over to the door... No! ...opens the door again... - ...boom! - No! This big cannon, again, just blasts him. So, at this point, Sam's stumbling around, burned, totally fucked up and shit, right? Bugs Bunny runs to another door. "He's not in here! He's not in here! No!" Ah! Ah! Sam's like... “I'll take your word for it, ma'am." “I'll just take your word for it." I love Yosemite Sam. - Sanchez, we're good. - Later. What happened? You fell asleep, Haraday. That's what happened. Sorry. Anything? Uh, yeah. 1:37, Agent Royce and two female suspects arrive. One blonde, 5'7", the other 5'2", brunette. At about 2:23, I think one of them went to the grocery store. She came back at 2:48-- Haraday, anything good? All right, try to stay awake, will ya? Yeah. At least keep those things around your ears. You got it. You know, like, when you were in school and you had to, like, do your dream homes and your, like, fantasy, what you wanna be, you know, all that stuff? Like, what did you see? What did you-- what was it? What was the thing that you wanted? Um... Well, first of all, we never had that. I don't think I actually went to school very much. Really? Yeah. All right, well, then, let's play a game. If you had to do that now... What do you think? Um... I don't know. I always used to like, uh... to like animals. Animals, really? Yeah, I wanted to, uh... I used to feed this cat and I wanted to save all the dogs in the world and the cats and the turtles. Turtles? I know, that's so random. That's very sweet. I wanted to open up, like, a five-star animal shelter. That sounds really stupid. That doesn't sound stupid at all. You know, like, not depressing? Yeah. Yeah. You know, you go to the animal shelters and it's disgusting. They don't clean it. It's, like, sad. I want to have a five-star animal shelter with a pool that the dogs can swim in. That's the best thing I've heard in a long time. And, like, TVs for the cats, you know? So they can not be depressed and everyone's happy. - Shit. - What is it? I don't know. Then turn it up. ♪ Oh, you know I had to rip it down ♪ ♪ Oh, sure gonna get that clown ♪ ♪ Go ahead and just get down...♪ Great job, Haraday. Yeah, you caught Royce with her girlfriends. Great work. Move. That Agent Royce has a wild streak, huh? Bet you had a pretty good time with her, huh, Chief? Shut up, Waters. Sir, I think I have something. - Monitor three. - All right, what is it? It's Reiley. What the hell is he doing here? Keep moving. Please-- please don't do this. Fucking be quiet. Please don't do this. Okay, you know what, you guys? I'll get the door. You guys just relax. You guys just stay here and relax. Okay. Hold on. - Whoa, oh, my-- - Back. - Okay. - Get in there. - Please don't. - Stop your fucking bawling. Shut the fuck up. Okay, come on. Be cool, be cool. So, then Bugs says, “Eh, why'd you pour oil on my head?" Frank... Okay, your Yosemite one's better? Frank, just stick to selling drugs, mate. Oh, come on, that's funny. That's funny. "Why'd you--" with the carrot and everything? That's funny, man. What are you talking about? Don't give me-- you know what? I'm done. Oh, Jesus. The fucking door's open again. Kathy! Shh, listen. You need to talk to her about that. She'll never learn. Come here. - Kathy! - Get down. - Get down. - Kathy! Don't make a fucking sound. I will shoot you. Okay, we're moving in. Okay, Waters, call headquarters. Tell them the situation. - Tell them we'll need backup. - Yes, sir. Follow me. Gonna take a piss. Make sure you flush that toilet, Frankie. - Fuck! - DEA! Turn around, put your hands on your head. Turn around now. - Secure. - Fuck! Shit, shit, shit. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Get up. Get over here. Now. I'll kill ya, fucker. DEA! Shit! There's one for you, Maxwell! You put it down, Reiley! There's no way out of here! You're surrounded. Put it down now! I'm walking out of here! This is Special Agent Waters. We need a medic and we need assistance right away. - Put your weapon down now! - Not gonna happen! No, no, no! Put that gun down now! Put it down now! Fuck you, Maxwell. You stay down, stay back! Ah! Let her go! You fucked with the wrong guy, asshole! It's okay, baby. I got you. You hurt her, I swear to God. What are you gonna do, shoot me? - Let her go! - Just shoot me, Frank! Fucking let her go! Ashley! You fucking asshole, eh? Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Back the fuck off, Maxwell. There's no way out of here. I believe that's my gun, darling. I'll fucking kill her. Fuck you. All right, stay down. Bastards! Freeze! Stay back. Hang on, baby, okay? It hurts. I know, I know, I know. Shh, don't talk, don't talk, don't talk. No, no, no, no. Don't do this. This is Agent Royce. Where's our backup? Hey, look at me. Look at me. Just do what I say, okay? Don't worry about it. Just do what I say. Come on, stand up. Okay, come on. I got her. Keep walking. Just keep walking. Stop, stop. Go, get outta here. Go. Go. Come on. Damn it. Guess you're not going to Costa Rica. Fuck you. Hey. I had it all planned out, but I failed. My fault. I should've known better. I used to say, "I'd rather do business with sharks than imbeciles." At least I'd know what they want. I'd understand how they'd try to screw me over. With imbeciles, you never know. I'd rather make a deal with the Vinnies of this world than with a corrupt cop incapable of controlling his substance abuse. Should've killed him when I had the chance. And Ashley, Eddie, the girls-- They're dead. The money's gone. Plan A failed. So did my plan B.
