You have really been amazing. Suneeta has been amazing, principal sir. - Her acting was really very natural. - Thank you. And I fully believe the second drama we are going to enact.. From our college is going to be more successful. But I will surely say one thing, Suneeta. You will have to pay a lot of attention to your get up. Don't worry. I will wear such a get up that you won't be.. Able to recognize me either. Everyone can be cheated but not me. As soon as I see you, I will recognize.. Who is real and who is counterfeit. As soon as I see you, I will recognize.. Who is real and who is counterfeit. Greetings, principal sir. Greetings, come. - Sit. - Live long, dear. I am sorry. I didn't recognize you. How will you recognize me? Nowadays even the children don't recognize their aged parents. Yes, there are such useless children too. - Make the children able like you. - Yes. I am Asharani's granny. I have come to fetch her. Okay. Okay. I will just call her. - Yes, sir. - Look, call Asharani from B.A. B section. All right. I have gone to your place once, but I didn't see you. How will you see? Nowadays old age is behind curtains and youth is on the roads. - Yes, sir. - Asha, your granny has come to fetch you. You have at last called your granny to college. Greetings, granny. Greetings. Pardon me, principal. This love called disease has not reached your college. I didn't understand. I mean to say that the children studying in this college.. Is less interested in studying and more in.. Leave it. I feel ashamed even saying it. In our age, first marriage then love. Today a boy is coming to see her. Tell her to get married. Why won't she, if you tell her to? These people consider us to be insane. Well, I am very happy to know that no one can leave class.. Without the arrival of grand parents. What can I do, mother? Some naughty students make some excuse.. And run away from college. That's why we have to be strict. Very good, dear. Very good. Otherwise girls nowadays even fool their principals. Asha, your principal is very innocent. All right, I will leave then. Greetings. - Greetings. - Come Asha. - Hi Asha. - Hi. Ashok, granny is to be thanked for our meeting, today. - Greetings, granny. - Greetings, dear. Asha these clandestine meetings are not good. Make your Ashok a groom and call him to your house. - I will become a groom soon, granny. - Come, Ashok. Wow, dear. You are biding this old lady farewell, as you have met your lover. Listen, first drop me at Suneeta's house.. And then you can go wherever you want. Come. Come, granny. Today you are looking so beautiful. You always say the same thing. Then am I wrong. Glance at the mirror. Your own evil eye will be cast. Let God will and the boys people like you. And this alliance should get fixed today. The alliance will be fixed. They will like the girl too. Which fool won't like this moon like face? - What is your name, dear? - Uma. - Uma You are really the form of Uma. Uma's mother, your daughter will become the wealth of our house. - But, who are you? - I didn't say who I am till now. I am boy's grandma. Grandma. Come, come. Come, dear. Dear, I like your daughter. - Sister. Sister. Sister. - What is it? The groom's people have come. Yes, yes, the boy's granny has already come. Grandma? But its 20 years since the boy's granny has died. Hey, who are you? Who, Suneeta? Yes, mother. I had dressed myself as an old lady for the drama in college. I was joking with Uma sister. Aren't you ashamed to crack such jokes? I am worried sick about her marriage here. - And you are thinking about jokes. - Sister. Forgive me, sister. I didn't know that they are going to see you now. - Have you forgiven me? - I did. Hey, Bare Dayaram come, come. Sit. - Greetings. - Sit. I am sorry, we were a little late. So what? You had to come home only. Daughter Uma, bring some tea. - Did you have any problem in your journey? - Oh no. Live long. Karuna Shankar, what is the matter? The girl is not walking properly. How will the girl walk properly? She is lame. Lame. Karuna Shankar, I had told you before that tell everything. Sister, I thought they wouldn't have noticed.. One negative aspect by seeing her beauty and skills. Will anyone swallow a fly after seeing it? Come, come. Sister, you are also a woman. You have children too. Wow, what happened if I have children? Shall I take this lame girl home as a daughter-in-law? Satish's mother, if Uma's mother wants to present.. This case with another aspect then? Only God can was the stain, God has implemented on the moon. It is not like that, Uma's mother. We can right the ailment in your daughter's leg God has given. Money covers all that is ugly. And that people from Chandpur are giving.. 10,000 cash along with a scooter for Satish. Leave the scooter. Uma's mother will give 11,000. 11,000? Mother, these two are increasing the price.. Of their son in the marriage market. They need a fat dowry. It is matter of intentions, dear. You can swallow a bitter pill better by wrapping it in sugar. And a lame girl can get married with the support of money. What did you say? I don't want anyone's support. I don't want to live being dependent on anyone. And mother, if I am a burden to you, then kill me. Strangle me. I am always being insulted. You merchant of marriage. I don't want to get married. I don't want to get married. Get out from here. - Karuna Shankar. - Get out from here. They have come to support me. From where do I get so much dowry? If I had around 5,000, then wouldn't I have my daughter treated? The doctor had said so any times, her leg can be cured. But, but nothing can happen without money. - Sir. - What is the matter, Suneeta? - You know that my sister is lame. - The poor girl. Who knows how she will spend her life? She will recover if I take her to the city and have her operated. That's good. Have her operated as soon as possible. You can take as much leave as you want. You are very kind. You have to do one more kindness. I need 5,000 rupees for the operation. You can give it and deduct it from my salary. - Only 5,000 rupees. - Yes. - Do you take me to be mad? I don't have money to give for charity. Understand? Go and work. Go. She needs money, the crazy girl. Everyone asks money. Everyone asks money. Wow, what is it? Come, what is it? What do you want? I want to meet Suneeta. You want to meet Suneeta? If you want to meet Suneeta then go to her house, madam. This is not a house but a shop. Do you understand? Sir, this is the judge's daughter. I am sorry, I didn't recognize you. You want to meet Suneeta. There she is. Go. Go. - Suneeta. - Asha you. I have told daddy, I am going to your house. - You are not going home? - No. I am going out with Ashok. - If father asks anything then manage it. Okay? - Okay. Ashok is sitting in the car. I will go. - Come, let's go. - Why? So soon. - See, the sun is setting. - But it is not dark yet. Come, the shameless person. Asha. Who will pick up these books? What is the time? - Answer me. - Seven. You know, that I don't like you to come late at all. Daddy, I went to Suneeta for.. I didn't ask you, why you went to Suneeta? I won't be late in the future, daddy. - The reason to send the driver home. - The reason. There is no reason. Asha, I don't like these meaningless talks at all. Don't forget that you are the daughter of a judge. You can leave. Sister, like the moon stain, you can see even a little effect in a girl. The problem in her leg had covered all of Uma's skills. Though Uma is not less than Suneeta in beauty. The one who sees her, he doesn't even pay heed to Uma. If you want, can I find an alliance for Suneeta? - Ramprasad and Gangaprasad, both are ready. - Is it? - Then fix her marriage. - No, mother. I won't get married till sister gets married. Daughter, you can see who will marry Uma? Then listen to my oath too, mother. I won't get married till sister gets married. - Sister. What are you doing? - Let me die. - Sister. - Let me die. - Don't be insane. Sister, life is to live. For me death is equal to life. If I die, mother will be unburdened. This marriage. I will be freed from these marriage problems. Till now, I have remained an enemy to your and mother's happiness. Sister, you are misunderstanding. This mistake of yours will become an enemy to mother. - People will talk. - No, no I won't return home. All right, if you want to die then come. Both sisters will die together. - No, you won't die with me. We will live together. - Sister. Sister. If you want me to live, forget this idea to die. There is no sin greater than suicide. Sister, return home. Come back home, sister. Suneeta, you are sitting here. I have been searching for you since long. - What are you reading? - The drama of life. But the book is closed. But the book of our life is open. In every page, words of helplessness.. And vulnerability are coming forward. But queen, you even force poverty and helplessness to laugh. Is this really sadness or you are acting sadness. This is not a drama, Asha. This is reality. God is enjoying with us. And is punishing Uma sister for His mistake. What is the matter? Tell me truthfully. I cannot see sister's pain. Since that poor girl is lame, she cannot get married. And my poor mother doesn't have money.. That's why she cannot have her treated. - Can her legs become well? - Yes. The doctor says, the leg can get well by operation. Why didn't you tell me all this before? Thinking that even our shadow leave us in darkness. Suneeta. I am sorry, that you don't consider me to be your friend. You don't consider me to be your companion. Your pain is my pain, Suneeta. Tell mother that Asha will give money for Uma's treatment. Asha the day, people will forget love and friendship.. That day the name of God will be erased from man's heart. Asha. I am coming straight home from college. But today you came earlier than usual. Today I have come to talk something special with you. Tell me, daddy. Since it will interfere your studies I didn't think.. Right to tell you that your marriage has been fixed with Suresh. - Suresh? - Yes. - Who is Suresh? The only son of my old friend Rai Babu Chandra Mohan. They live in London. Your and Suresh's mother had fixed this alliance in childhood itself. But unfortunately your mother died before seeing you as a bride. And now it is my duty to fulfill her wish. But daddy, I have some wish too. I have fulfilled every wish of yours. This is your parents' wish. But daddy, I have not even seen this boy. This is his picture. Suresh is reaching Mumbai the day after tomorrow from London. After 20, 25 days Chandra and sister-in-law will reach there too. They have got a huge business in Mumbai. But daddy.. I don't want to hear anything about this matter. Ashok, is there no other way. Where I will get both your love and daddy's blessings? Tell me, Ashok, tell me. - Yes, Asha. Your wish can be fulfilled. - How is that? - Do one thing. - Yes. - Suresh doesn't know you, right? And neither have you known Suresh. That's it. Behave in such a way with him in Mumbai.. That he will himself refuse for the marriage. But how can I go to Mumbai? And daddy will kill me, if he gets to know this. Then do one thing. Suresh lives in London. He certainly dreams of an Indian girl. - There is Suneeta. Suneeta. - Yes. - That's it. Send her to Mumbai as Asha. She will act in such a way that our drama will be successful. And if daddy gets to know then.. How will daddy come to know? He will himself refuse and go back to London. Just make Suneeta agree. Suneeta. Suneeta will surely do this drama for me. No, no, I cannot perform such a drama. This is the question of my life, Suneeta. Not me but your daddy can solve this question. Why don't you tell him clearly, you want to marry Ashok. You don't know daddy's stubbornness. I know Asha that parents are not so heartless.. That they will sacrifice their children's joys for their ego. Yes, Suneeta. My daddy is like that. You should have thought all this before loving Ashok. The time to think all this has passed. Now it is time to join the broken episodes of my love. Suneeta, I am asking for your help. This is not help, Asha. This is cheating someone. I cannot do such wrong things. Asha you, come, come. Come here. - Sit. - What are you doing? But what are you doing here now? I had promised 5,000 rupees for Uma's treatment. Take these 5,000 rupees. But why do you need to come so late at night to give money. I had to give, that's why I came. All right, I will go now. Asha, you are with Ashok in a taxi instead.. Of your car so late at night. What is the matter? - Nothing. - There is surely something. Are you and Ashok taking some wrong step? I don't know what is right and what is wrong. I have left home and I am going with Ashok. I didn't know Asha that you can even play.. With your father's honor blinded by love. Didn't he play with my life by fixing my marriage in childhood? Now my happiness and joy is only Ashok, Suneeta. But your happiness will dishonor your daddy, Asha. He won't be able to face anyone. I beg you, Asha. Don't commit such a big mistake. I have stepped outside home. Going back home means marrying Suresh. And I am not at all ready for this. All right, I will take a wrong step to stop your wrong steps. Truly, Suneeta? Yes, Asha. I, I will do everything for your happiness. Tell me, when do I need to go to Mumbai? Very soon in a few days. Take Uma along too. She will be treated there too. All right. But go home straight now. I have arranged everything for your departure. I have also told daddy that Suneeta is going to Mumbai.. To have her sister treated. Take this. The keys to our flat in Mumbai. And write letters from there to my address. Okay? And this is Suresh's picture. So that you can recognize him as soon as you see him. Good morning. Greetings. Who are you? I am Ganpat uncle. How do you do? Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. Do. - Didn't you recognize me? - Ganpat uncle. - Yes, me. You might be some other Ganpat uncle. No, I am that same, Ganpat uncle. You have forgotten me after going abroad. I can never forget my Ganpat uncle. He used to speak Hindi mixed with Marathi. He used to wear dhoti and kurtas and not suits and pants. See there. He is my Ganpat uncle. He seems so nice and innocent. He used to call as Suresh Baal (Child) and not sir. Baal. (Child) Baal (Child) Suresh. - Come. - Uncle. Baal(Child) Suresh. Suresh. You have not forgiven me. But I couldn't understand you. Suresh, you are great. You are great. Uncle, don't be proud of me. Bring a cup of tea for me quickly. I will get it. I will get it, dear. I will get the tea. Hello. Yes, this is Suresh Chandra speaking. Yes, I have arrived from London today itself. But who are you? Asha. Greetings. Greetings. But you in Mumbai? Yes, look, I have come to Mumbai.. With the excuse of my friend's treatment. Excuse? Why an excuse? Because our parents had fixed our alliance in childhood itself. Yes, yes. I know. But you don't know how am I. You also don't know, how am I. I have seen your photo. But you have not seen me. You have not seen my habits. I don't know if you will like me or not. Why not? I like you even without seeing. When should I come to meet you? Yes? No, no, I will come myself. Tomorrow evening at 4 o' clock. I have to go to the hospital now. With whom were you talking? Sister, it was some friend of Asha's. Sister, get ready quickly, we have to reach.. The hospital by 11 o' clock. Come. Hey, girl. Who are you? Whom do you want? Ganpat uncle. - Ganpat uncle. - Coming. Coming. Coming. Coming. From where do I come? Tell me, sir. Uncle, someone has come to meet you. - May be she is your daughter-in-law. - Daughter-in-law. Sir. Hey girl. Dear, maybe you have come here by mistake. No. strange. I don't have a son, then where did this daughter-in-law come from? Something is wrong. Daughter-in-law, this is my son and this is my master. And he is not married till now. It will. It will? Who have you come to meet? - With Suresh. - Me? What relation do I have with you? Who are you? - Look at this forced guest. - He had called me. Uncle Ganpat. She is lying. Why will I call her? You were about to fetch me yourself. - I and you? Who are you? - Asha. Asha? I had told you over the phone that I will come myself. You are that Asha. - Uncle Ganpat. - Understood. Two cups of tea. - Right. Right. - I will just bring it. Why are you standing now? Come, sit. Why are you giving me so much respect? In India they address the woman very informally. All right. Do come. I mean, come. Come. Sit. Why down? Sit here on the sofa. Yes, that's like it. - No why is this veil for? - I am feeling shy. - I cannot believe that.. - I am Asha. No, no, it's not like that. Actually I had guessed something else.. By hearing your voice over the phone. Suresh, I came here to tell you that, we have huge differences. Asha, differences can be rubbed out. But how, you are so educated and I am.. How far have you studied? I reached the ninth standard by father's influence. And I failed my tenth exams ten times. - Actually, I dint want to keep you in the dark. - Tea. Why are you hiding from Ganpat uncle? - He is an elder. - Daughter-in-law. Leave alone the veil, girls nowadays even cut their hair. Yes? I will cut my head, but I won't cut my hair. That's good. Daughter-in-law, take this tea. It is very hot, isn't it? - Shall I leave? - Daughter-in-law. The food is still being prepared. No, no, my friend must be waiting. I will come later. - Come, I will leave you. - Go, Go. - Come. - Go. Drop her quickly. What a daughter-in-law? What kind of daughters-in-law are there? Greetings. Listen. I have hosted a party for my friends and relatives. - Do come a little well dressed. - I will come. - But don't tell anyone that I am your wife-to-be. - Why? I have told you, I have to come to Mumbai without informing father. All right, I will tell you, you are my childhood girl friend. Okay? - Hello, Suneeta. - Hello, doctor. - All right Uma. - Thank you, doctor. - Sister, you can leave. Come by 7 o' clock in the evening. What is this, sister? You have not eaten anything. Take this. - It's sweet, right? - Yes. You have become elder to me despite being younger. You are taking such pains. You are serving me so much. Why do you say like this, sister? Nothing can be happier for me than the healing of your leg. - Cheers. - Yeah, good luck. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Hi, how do you do? - Fine. - Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. - Come Verma sir, how are you? - Just a minute. - Hello. - Hi. I had told you to come well dressed. Didn't I come well dressed? "My color, my beauty." "My cheeks, my hair." "My walk, my condition. Just look at it." "Look at it." "Do I look as you have thought me to be? "Do I look as you have thought me to be? "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "Do I look as you have thought me to be? "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "I came to the function." "At one glance I became the guest of everyone's heart." "I became a guest." "I came to the function." "At one glance I became the guest of everyone's heart." "I became a guest." "When I saw my face in the mirror, I was amazed at myself." "I was amazed." "I didn't know this.." "How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "Tell me." "My good darling, exert yourself a little for my sake." "Exert yourself a little." "My good darling, exert yourself a little for my sake." "Exert yourself a little." "If not by your lips, then at least praise me through your eyes." "Praise me a little." "Praise me, if I look the fairies." "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "Do I look as you have thought me to be? "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" "How do I look?" "King, tell me the truth. How do I look?" - Get down. - Why here? - I have to tell you something. What do you have to say? I had dreamt differently about you. I thought my wife to-be is the daughter of a reputed judge. She must have been molded according to the new society She must been raised among the high society. She will laugh and shake hands with my friends. She will go to parties in my arms. But you? You are so apprehensive. You are simple Indian girl walking on the line of shame. And seeing you I felt that even today an Indian girl.. Thinks shyness to be her ornaments. This is the pride for the women kind, Asha. - I like you completely. - Drat it. - Why? What happened? - No, nothing. I was thinking. - What were you thinking? I was thinking that you won't like me. Some fool won't like this diamond. No, no, will you drop me home? Dear Asha, Uma sister is fine. She remembers you every day. Your and Ashok's life must be getting deeper everyday. Correct. Now nothing must be more important than Ashok for you. Can anyone be? But Suresh is also someone, whom you won't meet.. Even if you search for him far and wide. I went to meet Suresh like a complete idiot. But he is such a devotee of Indian culture.. That he even saw Indian culture in my nonsense. And he started to praise me instead of abusing. I am sending you some photos of the way.. I am going to adopt for him to hate me. Yours Suneeta. Show me, what she has sent? Wow, what a picture. That was a fake Asha. I am the real Asha. The one whom you have seen till yesterday.. Was a innocent, stupid girl. In fact, I am a modern girl. But, why did you come to meet me with changed appearances? That was to test whether you pass my test of eligibility or not? Tell me. What do you think? Do you still like me? I like you a lot. We will get married. Marriage? So soon? Without courtship. Then when? First you test me. I will test you. I mean, we will stay together, eat, drink and have fun.. - This seems nice after marriage. - Is it? - Yes. The things which you like quickly become boring quickly too. - I won't divorce you at any cost. - But I can. If you tell me tomorrow that you need children. And if I say that I don't. I will certainly say so. A woman's lady's ends after having children. If you like your beauty more than children.. Then I won't insist for children. All right tell me, will you drink tea or coffee? Tea? Coffee? At this time? No. Drink, I mean whisky. - Whisky? - Yes, and we will have food outside too. Okay? - Okay. - Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hello. - Hello. Hi. - Hi. Many people know you here. Yes, all my boyfriends. But you come to Mumbai only sometimes. Yes, I come sometimes. If you have so many boyfriends here.. Then how many you will have in Shimla? I am Miss Shimla there. Tell me, which whisky will you drink? Whisky? I think it will be better for you to drink at home instead of here. If I had to drink, then what is home and what is the club? - Waiter, two large pegs. - No, just one. Good, rose sherbet for sir. Strange. You don't drink whisky. If you have drunk then I have drunk. - Johnny, she winks. - She seems fast. - It seems she will agree. - Truly? - Yes. Excuse me, I will just come. - Hello. - Come, sit. - No, thank you. - You are Rita's brother, right? - No, I am Seema's brother. Yes, Seema is my class mate. You are drinking whisky. Very good. - Hey, what are you doing? - For me, please. - Cheers. - Cheers. Drink whisky for our pleasure. Please. So sorry. Extremely sorry. Can I take a cigarette? - Why one? Take the entire packet? - Thank you. Thank you so much. - Take. Smoke. - No. - Strange. Neither drinks nor smoke after coming to the club. You have drunk I have drunk. What are you planning? All this is not good, Asha. - Asha. - Asha? Who is Asha? I am not Asha. I am very bad. You are very good. - Waiter, one more large drink. - What are you doing? Sit. Sit here. You won't understand, darling. I am drowned. Don't drink anymore, Asha? Alcohol is a very bad thing. "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "Why does he like me, ask the kind sir." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "The sir thinks like this about me." "The sir thinks like this about me." "I am a blooming flower of rose." "But thorns are surrounding the rose in such a way." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "The one who loves me is crazy." "The one who loves me is crazy." "Friends you can never trust me." "How can I tell you, some of my bad stories?" "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "I will be somehow blamed." "I will be somehow blamed." "Somewhere I will get some name." "You can see the story anytime from some book." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." "Ask the sir, why he likes me." "Alcohol is the worst thing." "I am even worse than alcohol." - Madam. - Yes. - Sir is calling you outside. - Sir? - Yes. Okay. I am telling, go from here. I am telling you, don't come forward. Don't come forward. No. No. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. No. Where are you going, darling? I like you but take me away from all of them. Truly? True. The girl. Hold her. Come. What are you doing, Suneeta? Nothing sister. I am writing a letter to Asha. - May I ask you one thing? - Ask me. You seem lost these days. What is it? - Nothing at all, sister. - How are you, Uma? - I am fine, doctor. Suneeta, last night you have gone to Ruby club? Me? A girl just like you was there with a young man. It might be someone else, doctor. Yes, she was a very flirty kind of girl. - Suneeta. You.. - I will go and post the letter, sister. I am the one who hides the pain in her heart.. And goes on doing the chores of the world. - Why? You were waiting for someone else? - No, come. - Not come, let's go. - Where? -Where I will take you. - But yesterday, you were.. - Yesterday was someone else's madam. - Today is mine. Come. - I am coming. Sit. - Okay. I don't want to keep you in the dark anymore Asha. Till now, even I had hid myself in Indian culture. I have been raised in the Western culture. This is my reality. Brandy or whisky? How about both? - Cheers. - But, you.. I am crazy about girls and alcohol from the beginning. What are you doing? I have not done anything till now. Actually I like going to clubs. But I have a reason to bring you here. What? My grandpa got married and he brought my granny here. My daddy got married and he brought my mummy here. And today I have brought you here to carry.. Forward the custom of my forefathers. But I am not married. The marriage will take place, my queen. - Look, you have tested me. Tested me. - Yes. I have tested you. And we will spend the entire night here. - We eat, drink and have fun. - No, no. Today I will drink so much that everything will dance. Today no one will be ignored. Drink - No. - Where are you going? Drink. - No. - You won't drink. - No. - Come into my arms. - No. - Come. - No, no. No, no. Why? This weather is beautiful. This moment is beautiful. - And on top of that you are beautiful. - No. - No. - Why are you scared? Here. Enough. You are shy of me? That day you were dancing and singing.. In front of everyone in the club. - "Alcohol is the worst thing." - No. "I am worse even than alcohol." "Then why does he like me?" - I will tell you today, why I like you? - No. "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" "It is the intoxication of your eyes." "If they are not clouds, then what are they?" "If they are not clouds, then what are they?" "It is the tresses of your hair." "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" "In the function of my desires you are going away." "Why are you so angry with me?" "That you are looking away from me?" "That you are looking away from me?" "If it is not the weather, then what it is?" "It is the opportunity to make love." "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" "I will spend a few moments with you.. In the shade of your thick hair." "We drink everyday from the sea." "Today I will drink from your eyes." "I will drink from your eyes." "If it is not alcohol then what it is." "She is a delicate darling." "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" "I feel like regarding it the night of Armageddon." "I swear on you I feel like giving you my life.. And not only my heart." "I feel like it." "If it not a killer then what it is." "It is your amazing attitude." "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" "If it is not the sea, then what is it?" I beg of you, let me go. I am not the one whom you think me to be. I am also not the one whom you think me to be. I am also not intoxicated. That was not alcohol. It was just sherbet. Then why did you enact this drama? That is what I want to ask you, that.. Why did you enact that drama that day? Do you think me to be such a fool that I won't know.. That judge's daughter cannot be as innocent.. As you have acted to be. And a girl from a good family cannot be so lowly.. As you have acted to be. Well, I like both you and your drama. Hey, you like me too right? My destiny is not so good. You have the destiny. Today a very good thing has occurred. - What? - I have to go to Kolkata for a week. I would have been very tense if this drama had not ended today. Believe me. Now I will pass my seven days quickly.. Remembering you and my acting. 'Dear Asha, all my endeavors to give birth to hatred.. In Suresh's mind has proved futile.' 'He has started to love me a lot as Asha.' 'Such time has come, that I don't want to cheat him further.' 'He has gone to Kolkata.' 'As soon as he returns I will tell him clearly.. That I am not Asha but Suneeta.' 'I don't know what the outcome will be. Always yours Suneeta.' Hello. Ganpat uncle speaking. Daughter-in-law, greetings. Yes, Suresh sir has returned from Kolkata last night. And is sleeping now. Is it? And yes, even his parents have returned from London today. His parents have come too! Now I should tell him everything. What daughter-in-law? Nothing. Nothing. - Greetings. - Greetings. Suneeta, how is your sister? She is fine. She will be released form the hospital soon. But how did you come suddenly? The father of our son-in-law to-be had arrived from London. And we have to talk something with him. Asha, go and get ready quickly. I will call them. - Tell me, how is your Ashok? - Don't take that dog's name. What is the matter, Asha? It seems you have been deeply hurt. I escaped, Suneeta. Otherwise I don't know what would have happened to me. After all what is the matter? The day I got your letter, the next day morning.. I was about to go to Delhi with daddy for a week. But suddenly daddy's program to go to Delhi got canceled. And I reached Ashok's bungalow to meet him that very evening. Tell me. You? Why are you shocked to see me? Why will I get shocked? Maybe because how I came here from Delhi. A lot of people come from Delhi. Sit. Why did you give me a wrong address? Why did you promise me falsely to write letters? False promise? To whom? All right, so now I have to even tell you that my name is Geeta. We met at an exhibition at Delhi. Those meetings had turned to love. And where we have journeyed together? A journey is a journey madam. You meet many people there. We get to know them. And when the journey ends, the recognition ends too. No, Ashok, no. Don't say like that. You had promised to with me in the journey of life. I had given you everything that belonged to me by trusting you. You have committed a big mistake. No, Ashok, don't say like that. After much problem I have found you and reached here. I have brought you the souvenir of our love. - Souvenir of love? - Yes, yes. I am pregnant with your child. Pregnant with my child. You are trying to lump.. Someone else's sin on my head. Ashok, you have only seen one form of woman. Let me stay in that form. I am pregnant with your child. Give me and my child to live in this society. Ashok, marry me and fulfill your promise. Calm down. Calm down. Calm down. I don't know how many girls I will have to marry.. - If I go on fulfilling promises like this. - No. - And you know the law of our country. Do one thing. - No. Forget me and marry some good boy. I am marrying the daughter of a very big judge of this city. Forget that girl. All right, so this is the other victim trapped.. In your web of false love? Would you please shut up? No, Ashok, you cannot play with life of some other girl. Asha, this wicked girl is condemning me falsely. Be ashamed, Ashok. Today I have witnessed your ugly form. I was late. I didn't know you are a devil in the guise of man. One day I was about to run with you leaving everything. Asha. But it is good, that our trip to Delhi.. Was suddenly canceled today and I came here. I don't want to see your face ever in my life. Asha. Asha, listen. Wait. Scared? The right for you to go from here is in my hands. - Not in your hands. Come with me. - Leave me. - Come. - I am telling you leave me. - Come with me. - Leave her. - Silence. I am telling you, leave me. You don't want to see my face, right? You don't even want to see my face. Go from here. God has saved you from being ruined today. - Go. - And you? - I am already dead. Don't worry about me. Go. Go. Go. Ashok became the victim of that girl's bullet. That sinner's life was death to me. And now his death had also become death for me. I am neither there nor her, Suneeta. Don't worry. Nothing has been spoilt till now. What is there to be spoiled? You have written in your last letter that instead.. Of hating you, Suresh has started loving you. Yes, but not with me but with Asha. Not with Asha. Only with the name Asha. When daddy will introduce me to Suresh as Asha then.. It will be good. Suresh will start hating me. I will become a lowly girl and a cheat in his regards. - No, no, Suneeta. I won't let you get defamed. - Asha. Asha. You are still not ready? I am ready. They might be waiting for us. Suneeta, you also come with us. Come and see what a good boy I have searched for Asha. Uncle, I will see him latter. Sister might be waiting for me. All right. Asha, get ready quickly. - Coming. - Is sir at home? - He is. - Come, daughter. Come carefully. Hands up. You are trapped after a long time Mahinder. If I was not trapped, how would you become my relative? Come, hug me. - Greetings brother. - Greetings. Greetings, sister-in-law. Amazing. Sister-in-law you have not changed at all. Didn't you recognize me, dear? You used to come into my lap. Today she doesn't come into my arms. - She has grown up. - Son Suresh. Look who has come? This is my childhood friend, Judge Mahinder Nath. - Greetings uncle. - Live long, dear. Live long. And this is our Asha. Asha? - But that girl in your flat. - She is Suneeta. Asha's friend. She has come here to have her sister treated. - Please, excuse me. - Come Mahinder. - Mother has sent no letters. - Suneeta. Suneeta, I want to talk to you. Sister, I will just come. Come. - Do you remember this place? - I can never forget this place. That beautiful moment, weather.. - And the storm of love in your heart. - Silence. Your cheating and deceit has been revealed. Why did you become Asha? Why did you play with my life? - To make my life. - By snatching your friend's right. - By cheating her. - Yes. - Why? For what? God has given her everything. He has given her wealth. He has given her honor. And her crime is that handsome and rich youth like you.. I couldn't tolerate this. Because of this jealousy I acted to be Asha. You are so lowly. You are so envious. This is not a new thing, Suresh. The poor is always envious of the rich. I was jealous of my friend's destiny. I tried to get you. To get your property I had done all this drama. Shameless. Unashamed. You have cheated me and Asha in so much. I don't even want to see your face. Who was he? Where did you go with him? I am asking something. Sister. Sister, don't ask me anything. I cannot say anything. So the doctor's suspicion was not a suspicion. This was the boy with whom he had seen you in the club. - Suneeta, I need an answer. - Yes, sister. He was that boy. But sister, whatever the doctor saw was not at all true. All that was a drama. Only drama which I had enacted for Asha. For Asha? Yes, sister. Asha's daddy had chosen Suresh for Asha. And Asha had decided to become someone else's. That's why Asha made this plan for Suresh to hate her. That I should meet Suresh as Asha and act this way. And Asha gave you 5,000 rupees for this drama. And you sold your limits to have me treated. - I wish I had died as an invalid. - No, sister. This is not the case. I have understood everything Munni. I have understood everything. You are pounded between Asha's favor and Suresh's love. You had gone to cheat Suresh. You are yourself cheated. Now when Suresh will know the truth.. And what will happen when the judge will know about this drama? No, no, I will tell Suresh everything. I will tell him, why and for whom you enacted this drama. - Understand? - Sister, don't get up. - No. I pray, if you love me even a little.. Then never open your mouth in front of anyone. Not even in front of Asha. You are under my oath, sister. We will leave for Shimla today itself. Greetings sister. Where is Suneeta? Suneeta, strange. You came straight to the station from the hospital. The train was due, Asha. I know everything, you don't want to go in front of Suresh. What is the need for that now? Suneeta, you have tolerated so much insult for my happiness. Would you have got Suresh's love, if I had not tolerated insult? Shall I tell you one thing, Asha? Suresh is a very good boy. He is a very loving boy. Take care of his heart, okay? Suneeta, are you in love with him? Crazy girl! Can anyone create hatred by loving? My wish is that your and Suresh's love.. Should bloom like the spring. This is such a beautiful place, green tress kissing the sky. These mountains which are doing penance like our ancient sages. These views soothe the mind so much. The mind gets so much peace by coming here from the crowd. The one whose world is ruined and the one whose heart.. Is engulfed in the sea of restlessness, he will be suffocated in this silence. What are you saying? Just like that. I just changed the topic from one to another. Come, let's go there. Look, what a beautiful sari? If you like it, then take it. No, no, I was just saying it. - I am saying so. Pack this sari. - No, no, no. I.. A gift from me. Okay. - Pack this sari and show me a nice shawl. - Yes, sir. Leave it. Let's go home now. Wow, shouldn't I see what I came for? Whom? I told you I had to buy a shawl for mummy. Come, let's see. Is it beautiful? - It is beautiful. Take it. - Pack this. - Come Asha. - Buy the shawl. It is very beautiful. - You like it too. - It seems to be good but it fake. Sorry, you don't have the right to say like that without testing it. I have tested it. Come, Asha. Suneeta, the judge has come. - Greetings, sister. - Greetings. We are lucky that you have come to our house. Come. - Sit. - Greetings uncle. - Live long. - Asha have come to invite you before me. - Yes. Sister, you all will have to come tomorrow evening.. To the engagement party. - Suneeta, you have to come with everyone. - Yes. - Not yes, you have to come. - Why won't we come? - We will surely come. - All right sister, give me leave now. - At least have some tea. - No, I had loots of tea today. Dear, are you coming home? - Suresh was asking for you. - Let's go, daddy. All right, greetings. - Mother, you and sister will go. - Are you mad? The judge came home because of you. It is your friend's engagement. If you don't go, we won't go either. All right mother. Let tomorrow come first. You have come. And have you come alone? No, everyone has come. Mother and Uma sister is downstairs with uncle. - Why were you so late? - I was not well still I came. The entire program would have spoilt if you had not come. I have told everyone that you are going to sing today. No, no, I can't sing. Not you, even your angels will also sing. Who will sing besides you for my happiness? These are the saris. Wear any sari among these and get ready, quickly. - Why? - Is this the sari you have worn? - Why, what is lacking in it? - There is no need to argue. No, Asha, leave it. This is okay. You will be beaten if you say no. Come, get ready quickly. - Hello judge. - Welcome, welcome, professor. Meet my to-be relative Mr. Chandra Mohan. Greetings. I am glad to meet you. Professor, do come inside. - Hello, how do you do? - I am okay. Please come inside. Excuse me. Listen, let me see how you look in the sari I have chosen. You? Why did you wear this sari? You have still not finished your drama to be Asha? Aren't you ashamed to enact this drama again and again? I have buried you and your drama. Shame on you and your lowly drama. - Hello, Uma. - Congrats. - Thank you. "Life is a drama." "We work in this drama." "Life is a drama." "We work in this drama."

Suresh, I am telling you, don't go too fast. Wait Suresh, I am telling you, wait. Suresh. Wait Suresh. Suresh, I am telling you, wait. Wait Suresh. Suresh, I am telling you, wait. Wait Suresh, I am telling you, wait. Suresh, wait Suresh. Wait. That's why I was telling you not to. You were facing so much danger. You? Yes, me. - You were.. - I am not dead. I am still alive. But that girl had shot you. That bullet had hit my hand. So that the foolish girl doesn't fire again.. I had consciously fallen on the ground. I had acted that I had died. After you people had left I got upon and smiled on my fortune. Geeta also considered me to be dead like you. Asha, it is easy to murder but very difficult to conceal it. Fearing the police maybe she had committed suicide. And the stone on my way was removed for ever. You are such a big sinner. - But I have committed no sin with you. - Leave me. How can I leave you, Asha? You love me and you are getting engaged to Suresh. I am telling you, leave my way. Let me go. All right. On one condition. Engagement with Suresh and marriage with me. I am telling you, leave me. - When will you meet me again? - Never. All right. All right. I will meet you myself. - Yes, sir. - Tea for two. Thank you. - Cigarette? - Thank you very much. Wow, our brand is the same. I am not habituated to smoke but I do so sometimes. But sir, I am crazy about this very brand. What will you take? - Oh no. Thank you. Waiter. - Yes, sir. - One large peg of whisky. - Okay sir. Pardon me, I am very shameless person. I have already drunk two pegs of whisky. No, no, it's all right. Carry on. Look, a person cannot forget two things in life. One is alcohol and the other is his love. Wherever alcohol or love is he finds it. - You are right, sir. - Well, leave it. It seems you have recently arrived in Shimla. Yes, I had come here once in childhood. My youth has bloomed here. Have you seen Shimla? Yes, I have seen some and some is left. There is a lot to see, there is lot to know. And I am one of them. You seem to be a very interesting person. Thank you. My name is Ashok Verma. Your name? My name is Suresh and this is my fiancée Asha. Greetings, Asha. It seems you are recently engaged. Your guess is correct. That is the guess. Your engagement and my wedding. Cheers. That means even you are engaged. When are you getting married? The day you are getting married. You crack good jokes. Who is there with you here? The one who is present in front of you. Yes? I am totally alone. Then you need to get married urgently. Only if my needs will be fulfilled. It will be. It surely will be. I will come to your marriage. When are you getting married? I have told you, the same day as yours. You joke a lot. Is the moment same too? Yes, the same moment and the same bride. I had told that I am shameless person but you didn't understand. I know how to teach manners to the shameless. Beware if you ever misbehave with anyone in the future. Let's go. You? Neither you can forget me, nor I can forget you. These are your letters and some photos.. Bearing the proof of our love. It is enough to break with Suresh.. And join the broken relationship with me. Isn't it? What will you get from my defamation and ruin? I am sorry that I have not got anything till now. Even after bathing in the sea of love, I am still thirsty. Don't be so heartless. My daddy is marrying me so happily. Say that he is doing injustice. Think about my daddy's honor Ashok. I pray you. I beg you. Return me these photos and letters. All right, if you want I will return you everything. And I will go away from your path for ever. - But on one condition. - What? You will come to me as bride before the wedding for a little while. No. no, I won't come. You will come. You will surely come. Respected people deal their respect with respect. He is alive. Yes, he is alive. But, but you have said something else. I was having a misunderstanding. Suneeta, even death fears the devil. But why are you scared? He is dead for you forever. He has threatened me. My photos and letters, all are with him. That person can ruin with its help. He can ground my daddy's honor. I fail to understand, what to do Suneeta? - What do I do? - After all what does he want? He is forcing me to come to his house on the wedding day. No, this can never happen. This can never happen. All right, we will teach him such a lesson.. That he will remember it for life. Asha. You? Is this a dream or am I cheated by my drunkenness. I am myself cheated. I have forgotten everything. I have come to you after changing. Then I will change too, my queen. I will change the entire world for you. The world I running well. Only you have to change. From today you won't drink alcohol. To drink the alcohol of your lips.. From today I won't drink this alcohol. Happy now? Before getting related to me, you have to stay in your limits. - Okay. Agreed. - Then come with me. - Where? To the temple. You will have to promise in front of God.. That you won't cheat me even in your dreams. Agreed. Agreed. But you will have to take an oath with me too. What? You have to marry me. Ashok, how many times will you make me promise? I have come to you breaking all relations. Okay, I trust you. Come, let's us go take our oaths in front of your God. - Bihari. - Yes, sir. - I am just coming. Come, come Suneeta. - Did Asha come? - Yes, she had come. She had just gone outside with Ashok sir. - You are not well. - I have a cough. Take, take some water. Not water, quickly bring this medicine. - I will just bring it. - Come quickly. Even if I go running, it will at least take half an hour. Priest pray for us. And do such veneration that the Goddess is pleased today. Tell me, how much are you going to donate? 100 rupees. Why 100 rupees, priest? Offer 500. I forgot my purse at home. I will just go and call. Leave it Ashok, we will venerate later some day. No, Asha, today the biggest wish of my life is going to get fulfilled. Priest, we are just coming. Sister, you? Yes, Munni, I had heard your and Asha's conversation. - Hurry up, he might come. - Yes. - Hello. - Bihari, where were you? I had gone to bring medicine for Suneeta. For Suneeta? What is she doing? Maybe she is inside. All right. Suneeta, where are you? Suneeta. Suneeta. Open the door. Open the door. Open the door. Ashok! This is it. - Hurry up, Munni. - Come. Come, give me the file. No. Mother. Mother. People from Nainital had sent a letter. - What has they written? - They written. We like Uma. There is no question of dowry. This is the fruit of Asha's benevolence and your service. That day I will also eat lot of fruits. You give others your share of fruit. This is where intelligence is, sister. All right mamma, I am going to the emporium. What has happened to her? Don't worry. Sometimes she has such attacks. Uma. Uma. What do you want? What I want is not in your shop. I don't have time for useless talks. Where do I have the time, madam? I am too busy. Tell me quickly, what do you want, otherwise I will tell sir. Do you know the meaning to complain to sir? It is to lose Uma forever. What did you say? You have surely burned my and Asha's letters and photographs. But not your sister's happiness. You cannot come near her happiness. What do you mean? The meaning is straight. The wedding procession and the groom will come to your house. But the bride, that is Uma won't be there. She is in my clutches. What? To get Uma you have to break the union.. Of Suresh and Asha you have made. You had enacted that drama for Asha. Now for me you have to tell Suresh the truth. Listen to it once more. Asha will come to my house on the wedding night. And at that moment Uma will step into your house. Good night. You have come too. It is dark. But your sister has not come till now. Don't worry mother. She is at Asha's place. - How do you know? - Asha had called me at the shop. What a crazy girl? She could have told me. I was anticipating such bad things. She is a young girl and the world has evil eyes. Why have you brought me here? Tell me. To appease my thirst. I am telling you. I beg you. For God's sake let me go home, Ashok, please. I have brought you from God's house. And you are saying let me go for God's sake. Come in. You must be hungry, have some fruits. Today you will be paid for your sins. Yes, I am burning like anything. - Give me the knife. - Move from my way. I will stab you scoundrel, rascal, dog Ashok. You men think women to be toys, right. You regard them to be weak. But if she wants she can fix thousands of men like you. Scoundrel. You can't, you understand? No. no. I am telling you come here. You go. Come here. Come here. No, Ashok. Please stop. Ashok, leave me. - Now I will only release your corpse. - No. - Leave this sari. - No. - I will have you dishonored. - No, leave me. I won't spare you. You have ruined my plans. I have told mother that Uma sister is in your house. But what do we do now? How can we release her from that devil? Madam, a sir told you to give this packet especially to you. This is Uma sister's sari. 'Dear Asha.' 'Right now your dear friend Suneeta's sister.. Is in my clutches right now.' 'The proof of it is this sari. Don't worry.' 'Her honor can be saved.. If come to me before going to the wedding altar.' 'Otherwise you know.. Yours Ashok.' Light all the lamps and brighten the entire house. Master, is some special guest going to come today? Not guest but the mistress to-be of this bungalow. Who will step into this house like a new bride. Bride? But the marriage? The marriage might be taking place. The instruments might be playing. But the bride. The bride will be here. You won't understand. Leave me alone tonight. - Tiger take care of the outside. - Okay sir. It seems the wedding procession has come. Let's go. Let's go. No, Asha. The wedding day is a very happy day. And such happiness comes only once in a girl's life. You shouldn't be sad in such good time. - Suneeta, I am scared. - Don't worry about anything. - Everything will be fine. - But, but he has threatened me. A threatening is a threatening, Asha. Suneeta, this good day has come to my life.. Only because of you. I will be forever indebted to you, Suneeta. - I can't forget it. - Crazy girl. Am I a stranger that you are talking like this? May God make this new life of yours bloom with happiness. The new life will start only when the seven rounds will get over. - Let Uma go. - You mean I should release her like this. I mean, she doesn't have clothes on her body. I have brought her sari along. All right, I will release her. Uma doesn't have any problem in this house. Two men are outside to guard. A maid is their in the house to serve her. - What more does she want? - But you had promised. Then when have I refused? But I am not such a fool that I will release her.. As soon as I see you. First let me drink the juice of your beauty. Let us get one by body and heart. - After that I will release Uma. - Ashok. I have not run from the marriage hall.. So that I can return home. I have come for you. I can show you my face only to you and not the world. Release Uma, Ashok. Her family is waiting for her. Even I am waiting for you since years. But I am not going to come into talks.. Till you don't come into my arms. Till you don't become mine. Will you agree to one thing of mine? If it is agreeable I will surely agree. Show me Uma once and allow me to give her this sari. All right, you can see her. Come with me. See her. - Asha. Asha. - Wear these clothes, Uma. - Asha. - Come. - No. - Enough, come. Don't be scared. Have you seen her? - I have seen her but still I haven't. - Come with me. Take. What is this? That day you were acting to change me. But today, today I will really change you. I will change you completely. You know, I don't drink alcohol. All right, but you have to drink today. Forget that you are Asha. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Yes. Drink it. That's it. Drink. Very good. Drink more. If you keep on drinking like this.. Then you will forget yourself completely. Really, I have forgotten everything. I have forgotten the limits of a woman. I have forgotten the society and God. Now I can see only you. "If I remove the veil from my face, then knives will be used." "If I remove the veil from my face, then knives will be used." "If I lower my eyes down." "If I lower my eyes down, then the arrow will be fired." "If I remove the veil from my face, then knives will be used." "My love, my youth." "My love, my youth." "Human beings have long story." "My love, my youth." "If I relate this story to you." "If I relate this story to you, then the night will end." "If I remove the veil from my face, then knives will be used." "There are so many fake curtains on the eyes." "There are so many fake curtains on the eyes." "The face behind the face is real.' "There are so many fake curtains on the eyes." "If I show you that form." "If I show you that form, then the color will change." "If I remove the veil from my face, then knives will be used." "My attitudes and my mannerisms.' "My attitudes and my mannerisms.' "All my secrets are behind the curtain." "My attitudes and my mannerisms.' "If I tell you this secret." "If I tell you this secret, then life will come.." Enough! This life will not end so soon, my love. Knives will be used. Betrayer, you want to kill me after fooling me with trust. - You want to take my life. - Sir, Uma has fled. Uman has fled? Where are you going? I have understood your plans, rascal. The witch who had cheated me. I will ruin you now. Ashok. Ashok, don't ruin her. Respect her. Let her go. Why did you do this, Asha? Today is your wedding. Why did you come here? Asha. A blind person asks for one eye and God grants him two. Not bad. That's good. - Asha. - Suneeta. - Asha. - Suneeta. - Suneeta, you had drank alcohol? - Yes. Crazy girl, I can even drink poison for you. Truly Ashok, you are not a man but a devil. You are a beast. Ask this cheater of a girl if I am a man or a devil. Ashok, you wanted me to come to you.. - Before going to the marriage altar. - No. I have come. Now release her, Ashok. Release her. It will not end like this. I will marry you right now. And her. I will keep her as my slave. - Ashok. - No. - Ashok. - Leave me. No. Leave me. Leave me. - Ganga. - Yes, sir. - Take these two. - No, no. - Come, come sweetheart. - No. You shouldn't refuse. Come, let's go upstairs. Leave me. Leave me. - This side. This side. - No, no, no. That's it. You shouldn't bother me too much. One day in this place, in this room.. I tried to make a girl the victim of my lust. Your father punished and ruined me. And today. Today I will ruin you and punish her. No, no, Ashok. Don't do this. Don't do this. No, no. Leave her. No. No. Hey. Where? - There. - No, outside. Okay. No problem. Why did you hit him? - I am sorry. I committed a mistake. - Committed a mistake? Should I tell you why I had hit him? Mother. No. - Move aside. - No, Ashok. Come with me. Come with me. Nobody will try to move from their places. No. No. Suneeta. Wait. You cannot take Asha, till I am here. Why do you want to play with your life? Go back. My life. Only cowards love their lives. Fire. No, no, Suneeta. Move aside. This devil will shoot you, Suneeta. No, Munni. What did you do, Asha? Daughter! What happened? Daughter. The drama has ended now. I have been punished for my mistake. Daddy. - Daughter. - Daddy. Suneeta is your daughter, daddy. She is your daughter. Suresh. Suresh. Suneeta loves you. She was.. She was sacrificing her love for me. Suresh. Suneeta. The two of you.. - Let your love should remain immortal. - Asha. - Daughter. Daughter. - Asha. - Asha. - Daughter. - Asha. Asha. Asha. "Life is a drama." "We work in this drama." "We salute everyone as soon as the curtain rises and falls." "We work in this drama."
