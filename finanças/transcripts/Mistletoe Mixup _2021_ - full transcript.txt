Why are you smiling? Because it's the most wonderful time of the year. The smell of fresh pine, cocoa, cinnamon. You are so lucky. I mean, I can't wait to have all of this. Wait, kids? You can have 'em. I should probably find my Prince Charming first. Please, just take my kids. - Mom! - Behave. I will leave you with Santa. Yay! Oh, how was the speed-dating event I set you up on? - Any keepers? - It was... Juicy? - Uh... - It was scandalous? - Non-existent. - What? Next. Holly, you are in your prime. You should have a line of guys waiting to take you out. Can you put the phone down? - I'm following up - with the Bell/ - Boyer account. Their marketing team wants to do that shoot before Christmas. Okay, fine, but once you nail down the shoot, can you put it away? - Yes. - Gotta keep perspective, babe. We run an ad agency, not air traffic control. Look, Holly, I love you, I do, but this whole workaholic thing, it's not healthy. When's the last time you a trimmed a tree? Isn't this supposed to be the most wonderful time of the year? Does the one on my desk count? Courtney, please come to office 105. We have another paper jam. Holly. Look, there will be plenty of time for tree-trimming and all that other stuff later. Life does not start later. The holidays do not start later. Here, take my card. I want you to go to the tree farm, and I want you to buy the most beautiful one you can find. - But... - No buts. Consider this a direct order from your boss. And I will be checking the charges to make sure you follow through. Fine, I will go buy a tree. Now, if we can find you somebody to share this beautifully trimmed tree with... Yeah, I think all the guys in this line are taken. Everyone gets a wish on Christmas. I guess there's hope yet. What do you mean? Well, I could always use my Christmas wish to find my happily ever after. Well, better late than never. Okay, all right. My Christmas wish is to meet Mr. Right. Stop beating up your sister. I will ground you for life. I'm sorry. What was that last part? I said, my Christmas wish is to meet Mr. Right. Hey, she got two wishes. No, she didn't mean it, sweetie. She's just very lonely. Next. All right, slow down. Merry Christmas Hmm. Nope. That's a little bit too big. Hm. Nope. Oh, you're cute. Hmm. Come here. Help. Miss, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I don't know what happened. I do. I think that tree fell over on you. Let me help you up. I'm Tom Wright. Oh. Mr. Wright? Oh, please, you can just call me Tom. So can I help you find a tree? Actually, I think the tree picked me. Well, you can't go wrong with a classic noble fir, but would you consider maybe a Colorado blue spruce? They are super on trend this year. I think I'm gonna go with the noble fir. You sure know a lot about trees. Do you work here? No. No, I don't work here, but I love Christmas. And I'm actually here picking out a tree for myself. - Can I help you with that? - Nah, I got it, pal. Okay. So, um, I guess that's it. Noble fir it is. That's the one. Let me help you with that. All right. Come on, let's go. That should do it. Proper knot for a proper tree. You know, I never got your name. Oh, I'm Holly. Nice to meet you. Well, nice meetin' you, Holly. You're all set, so happy holidays. You too, and thank you. Sure, don't mention it. Take care. Wow. You know, Holly. Yeah? Would you like to, um, um... get some dinner sometime? I mean, if I'm not overstepping. I would love that. - Yeah? - Give me your phone. Okay, um. Here you go. Okay, well, I'm a walkin' away for real this time. Okay. But I'll call you, because I can now, and we can go get that dinner sometime if you want to. Really lookin' forward to it. Okay. Bye now. Bye. Help! Help, a little help here! Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Here, let me help. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I'm so sorry. Oh. What happened? - I... - It's okay. It's all right. I'm... I'm all right. I'm fine. It's okay, really. Did you tie this thing up onto your roof? No, it was the guy at the tree lot. I think he called it a proper knot. Proper knot? No, that doesn't even exist. Nah, this looks like a, this looks like a slipknot. Should have done like a timber hitch or maybe even a sheepshank, somethin' you can easily get undone when you get home. I mean, what is this, amateur hour here? I'm sorry. I don't mean to talk bad about someone I haven't met. It's just, I mean, you really could have hurt somebody. I'm sorry. What happened? Was he, like, havin' a bad day? Did he get distracted or somethin'? Miss? Yes. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely what? To what you just said. Right, um. Why don't I get this up on your roof for you. You know what, I just live down the block. It's probably easier at this point if I just carry it. Oh. Okay, uh. Do you need a hand? Sure. Okay. Austin, by the way. Holly. Nice to meet you, Holly. Lot of sap. I'll do it. - Okay. - Okay. Pull up. All right, just, yeah, get the... Once the trunk is through there... - Yep. - I can get it from there. - Okay. - Okay. We're almost there. Okay. Okay. - All right, we got it. - Okay. All right, goin' in here. - Yeah, just... - Right here, whew. That way. Almost in the hole. Wait, no, a little to the left. To the right, the right. Okay! Right, right there, drop it. Okay. Oh. I meant get something a little smaller. It's fine, just needs a little trimming. Yeah, trimming. How do I do that? You got some shears? Yeah. Okay, um. I think we're gonna need somethin' a little bigger than this. Do you, uh, you got lights and decorations and all that kind of stuff? I think we're gonna need to make a little trip. Well, I've got this covered. Okay, let's go. What are those for? Uh, tree trimming. So cool. Both, why not. I did. Hummingbird? That means you have to make cookies. Against the green tree. - Uh. - Oh! Gotcha. Hi. Okay, oof. Oh, boy. It's good. It's good. We forgot to get hooks. - We? - No. I forgot to get... You're the professional. I forgot to get hooks, yeah. Nothin' to it. You and your knots. I love knots. My grandfather taught me every knot. Well, about 10 knots. There's a lot of, you know, they're very useful. It's a very specific thing with tinsel. See, you take like a good loop of it, right? Like this, and then you go... See? See how much nicer that... Oh, come on. You should see my grandma's tree. She goes way overboard with the tinsel. It's like, is there a tree to go with that tinsel, Grandma? This is amazing. How'd you get so good at this? It's part of my profession. I'm an artist. Hmm, and that includes tree-trimming? I work in mixed media, sort of the same thing. What? Nothing, it's just, this was really fun, and you're a complete stranger. Well, I was a complete stranger until your tree fell on me and almost killed me. And then we decorated it. I think that makes us friends. I'm glad it did though. Hey, do you want somethin' to eat, or drink? Oh, no, you don't have to go through all that. Are you kidding me? It's the least I can do. I'll make you somethin'. Okay. Not one to turn down food. How about some pasta? Yeah, anything, I'm easy. Or a sandwich? Yeah. Yeah, that all sounds great. How about we order food? That's fine. My treat. I'm stuffed. Me too. I didn't realize how hungry I was. Yeah. So your dad was a fireman? Yeah, he was. He was a really special guy. He died about four years ago just before Christmas. Yeah, that must've been really hard on you and your mom. Actually, my mom died when I was 12. It was just me and my pop. Oh, Holly, I'm so sorry. Yeah. I think about him all the time. Yeah. Yeah, my dad, he died a few years ago. I miss him a lot. But, you know, I have two brothers, my mom, and a crazy old grandma. They're nuts, but I mean, whose family isn't, right? You're lucky. Yeah, I am. I know it. It's getting kind of late, Ms. Holly. I think I should get goin'. Yeah. I'd like to see you again. Well, you know where to find me. Well, um... Sorry. Um. I'm not really, uh, up on all the new dating customs. I'm trying to catch up. Here's my number. Call me, no pressure. Okay. Great. All right, I'm gonna go. Bye. Hey, Austin, wait. Wait. Um, drive safe. Don't get hit by any trees. I won't. - Bye. - Bye. I forgot my jacket. - Bye. - Bye. No, absolutely not. No, just get it done. Get it done. Get it done. Get it done. Get it done! Goodbye. Everything, okay? Here, sit. Photographer's running late, and our first model has a hard out in an hour, so. I'm so sorry. Sorry? Look, you've worked for me for seven years, and you've never been late. You're like a machine. I know there must be a story. Okay, tell me there's a guy. - I met a guy. - Oh, yes. I want details. Well, I got a Christmas tree, like you said. And then the tree fell off my car, and it hit this guy, and he ended up carrying the tree back to my place, and we, we decorated the tree and ordered food. Wait, are we talking like fairy tale material here? Oh. True love's first kiss. Slow down. Oh, a gentleman, I can get behind that. You gonna see him again? I hope so. Yeah. He gave me his number, and I texted him right after he left. Oh. What? What was that? Why? Why, "Oh"? Look, I've been out the game for a couple years, I know. But aren't you supposed to wait a while before you send the first text? No. No, Austin's different. No, I am positive I made the right move. I think. All right. Well, I mean, what did he reply? Well, nothing yet. All right, well... Oh, great, the photographer's finally here. All right, bring in the first model. Hi. Nothing. I don't understand. He ghosted me. There's plenty of fish in the sea. I mean, you're just gettin' back out there. It's gonna take a couple tries to find the right guy. Yeah, but I really liked Austin. Girl, it was one date. One random, spontaneous, once-in-a-lifetime kind of date. Okay. - Hello. - Holly? Austin? Holly? Can you hear me? It's Tom from the tree lot. Oh, uh. Hi, Tom. How you doin'? Good. Really good, thanks for askin'. Holly, I was wondering if I could maybe take you to dinner this week? Uh, sure. Great. What night are you free? Tonight! Oh, that's perfect. How about Del Sol in Midtown, eight o'clock? I can pick you up. You know what, it's actually on my way home from work, so I will just meet you there. Sounds good, see you then. Okay. And who is Tom? Actually, you get credit for this one too. I met him at the tree lot right before Austin. Look at you, see, I told you, reeling 'em in, plenty of fish. - Hello. - Hi. You look beautiful. - Thank you. - Yeah. Please. So how's your tree? The Colorado spruce, it's doin' fantastic. Good. How about work? What is it that you do, again? I'm in finance, so, you know, the end of the year is always crazy. I'm just tryin' to wrap everything up before the holidays. I can relate. Yeah? What about you? Have any big plans for Christmas comin' up? No. No, usually, I've been so busy the past few years I just work through the holidays. Work through the holidays? Mm-hmm, I help my boss out with her kids, but this year they're going back east, so she's adamant that I unplug. It'll be nice to have some alone time. Do you have any siblings? No, just me. My parents are no longer with us, and I usually spend Christmas with friends, but I always end up feeling like a third wheel. Or like a 13th. Well, I'm sure your friends love having you around. Pinot? - Sure. - All right. Thank you. To, uh, never being the third wheel again. - Cheers. - Cheers. - Very good pick. - Thanks. Here you go. - Thank you. - You got it. Have you been here before? I have. Yeah. I recommend basically everything. - Great. - Yeah. Dinner was great. Thank you. Yeah, it's one of my very favorite spots. The owner is actually a friend. I'd, uh, I'd like to do this again. Would that be possible? Maybe. This is me. I remember. Yeah, here. Thank you. - Well. - Well. - Goodnight. - Goodbye. Yeah. I didn't mean to startle you. It's okay. Um, this might sound crazy, but my family and I, we own a cabin in the mountains. We go there every Christmas. I know you said you didn't have any plans for the holidays. So I was wondering if you would maybe wanna come join us? Does that sound crazy? No, it's incredibly sweet. But I couldn't impose like that. It would be no imposition at all. As my grandmother always says, the more the merrier. Look, um, sleep on it. We leave the day after tomorrow. I would love it if, uh, you would come join us. Okay. I'll think about it. I'll let you know. Okay. Well, goodnight, again. - Goodnight, Tom. - Yeah. Okay. See, I told you, you just needed to open yourself up to the magic of the holidays. I don't know what to do. What do you mean? Look, last week your love life was non-existent, and now we look at you. You're goin' on a ski trip with a handsome bachelor. I just met the guy. Alright, fine, be independent. Just meet him up there. You can stay at our cabin! Oh, Vicky, no. - I can't do that. - I insist. We're not makin' it up there this year, and I refuse to let that place go to waste. Oh, this is perfect. You're going. No, I don't know. This is exactly what you need, a fabulous holiday trip with your new guy. He's new, but he's not my guy. I barely know him. Girl, don't be a fool. Besides, meeting the family will make the decision for you. You will know everything you need to after you meet them. It is a beautiful drive. When's the last time you've been in the mountains? It's been awhile. Ooh, come on, Holly. Call him, and tell him now. I'm not gonna call him now. I will be in Philly with four honey badgers who are actively plotting an all-nighter to catch a dear old St. Nick. Let me live through you and the excitement of new love. Fine. I will call him. Hello? - Hey, Tom, it's Holly. - Holly! If the invitation still stands, I would love to spend the holidays with you and your family. That's great news. But I'll... I'll meet you up there, because I made my own arrangements. Are you sure? I don't mind driving you. Yeah, of course. I'll let you know when I arrive in a few days. Sounds perfect. Well, let me know when you get there. And, um, drive safe, and I can't wait to see you. Okay, sounds good. I'll see you soon. - Bye. - Bye. You gotta pack. I gotta pack. Can I help you find something? I would love that. I need to rent some skis for the week, but, if I'm being honest, I have no idea what I'm looking at. Oh, well, you mind if I ask you a few questions, see if we can narrow things down a little bit? Sure. What type of skiing do you usually like to do? It's been a few years. A few years isn't too bad. A decade. Well, you're gettin' back out there. So do you like to ski the groomed runs, or are you looking for a little more adventure out of bounds? Usually a groomer girl, but I think it's time to broaden my horizons while I still can. Not exactly a spring chicken anymore. Come on, you're in the prime of your life. Time's on your side. But since it's been a few years, how about if I set you up with these all-mountain skis? That way you can try a little bit of everything, and you should be able to find what you're looking for by the end of the week. That's perfect. So, anything else I can help you with? Ah, maybe some luck. I'm gonna need it. Or a guardian angel. You're gonna do just fine, young lady. The mountain has a way of keeping us in the moment and helping us find things we didn't even know we were lookin' for. I'll just take these in back and get 'em set up for you. Holly, I hope you enjoy this holiday. I had the neighbors put up a few decorations. I hope it adds to the Christmas spirit. Just use the smart tablet to work the place. You'll figure it out. Have fun, hun. Enjoy. That's an order. Love, Vicky. Hey, Vicky, it's me. I know you're on the plane. Just wanted to let you know that I got to the cabin okay. And it is... it's absolutely magical. And really, no one's ever done something so wonderful for me before. I'm meeting Tom tomorrow, so I'll let you know how that goes. And, uh, yeah. I love you. Thank you again, really. It means a lot. Hope you have a safe flight, and I'll talk to you later. Bye. Okay, Mr. Wright. Here we go. Holly? Austin? Holly! - Tom? - Tom? - Austin? - Austin? Holly? Wait a minute. Do you two know each other? How do you two know each other? So how in the world did the three of you meet? Well, it's not the three of us, Grandma. It's the two of us and a third wheel. I invited Holly here. Yeah, like a tricycle. You know, the triangle's the strongest shape in nature. Uh, Holly and I met at a tree lot, actually. I helped them pick out the perfect noble fir and even attached it to her car for her. It was really kind of fate. Wait, wait a minute. That was you? Hmm? You almost killed me. What are you talking about? Who ties a projectile to the roof of the vehicle with a slipknot. I mean, how dumb can you be? It was practically manslaughter. We're really gonna start with the name-calling? Besides, it couldn't possibly be manslaughter, because unfortunately no one died. Anyway, about a week later, I called Holly, invited her to dinner. We met up, talked for hours and hours. It was like we had known each other our whole lives. Give me a break. All right, that's it. You know what, I don't wanna cause any problems. I think I should go. Thank you so much. No, no, no, no, please. I'm sorry. Yes, I'm sorry as well. - We're sorry. - Exactly. Please stay. Holly, sit down. You're my guest, too, and I insist that you stay. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ Austin, how did you meet Holly? Well... ...Holly and I met when the tree that Tom attempted to secure to Holly's roof, with the most juvenile knot you could imagine, flew off and hit me. So I helped her back to the apartment with the tree, and, you know, we decorated it and spent five hours together. It was nice. It was really nice. At least, that's what I thought. Wait a minute. You spent five hours together? Oh boy. Yeah, the tree that you picked out didn't even fit in her apartment. I love it. Oh, it reminds me of back when I was being pursued by Raymond, and others, before everyone got so entitled and lazy about dating. Were you gettin' into the eggnog a little early, Grandma? Oh, hush up, Seth. Your grandfather was wonderful, but he was hardly the only man who was seeking my attention at the time. All right, Grandma. I'm talkin' about a good old fashioned cockfight. This has really gone far enough. I agree. Holly and I will go out on a date alone. That is that. Why are you taking Holly out? Because it makes more sense, okay. We have a lot more in common, and look, I don't wanna be harsh, but I'm in a little more financially stable situation. - I started dating her first. - You started dating her first? Actually, no one was dating me. Boys, like I was saying, I was dating a marvelous man when your grandfather came along. Oh, Harry. Grandpa's name was Raymond. And I loved your grandfather, but I often wonder what would've happened if Harry had stuck around. Ah geez, Mother. Harry was a musician, and he often had to leave town for long periods of time. And in his absence, Raymond came along and swept me off my feet. We didn't have this cowardly, handheld, swipe-right, iBox thingy. You had a walk up to the person, be bold, and take your best shot. Okay, Mom, we get it. Tomorrow, why don't you take Holly skiing with you. Both take her on a date, may the best man win. I can speak for myself on this one. I'm not gonna be anyone's Christmas conquest. I think I should go. Thank you very much for the, um... Yeah. - Well- - So- - Well... Austin, come here. I need your help with somethin'. Oh. I'll be right back. Take your time. Listen, Tom, - I didn't know that... - Hey, hey, I don't need any explanations, okay? I think you're an amazing girl. I think we have something really special, and I'm looking forward to defining exactly what that something special is. So I hope you consider coming skiing with my family and I tomorrow. Oh, Tom. What? Grandma wants to you. Oh, really? Tom, come here a second. Coming, Grandma. I'll be right back. Look, um, you don't need to come skiing with us tomorrow. I mean, things got pretty strange, pretty quickly. I mean, I want to. Really? Are you sure? Are you sure? Because you're the one that ghosted me. Ghost? What ghost? What do you mean? You never texted me back. But now, all of a sudden, because of some weird brotherly competition, you're suddenly interested again? No, no, no, not at all. Wait a minute. You texted me? Yes, a couple times. More than a couple times. Holly. What? You were texting my landline. I gave you my house number. Your house number? Yeah. You gave me a... a landline? Yeah, I... I said call me. I even wrote it on the... the note. Who has a landline anymore? I work from home, and it makes sense to me. I'm... I'm so relieved yet... super annoyed. So I guess I will see you tomorrow. Just don't call my landline! Because I'm here now. See you tomorrow, Holly! All right. Cali, Seth, we'll meet you guys at the lodge at noon for lunch. - Later. - Come on. - What about Austin? - Oh, he'll find it. Cowabunga, dude! It's a beautiful day. It is. It's almost a perfect day, besides one notable exception. This isn't my idea of a perfect day either, bro, okay? Well, we wouldn't have a cabinet come to if I hadn't saved the family business. So that's what this is about, huh? Why don't you just let it go? Stop holding it over all of our heads. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. Maybe I will. Maybe I won't. Maybe I will. Wow, they're really good. Yeah, I don't know how they got that good. I could have been that good if I wasn't busy runnin' the family business. I've had enough! That's it. He'll be fine. Come on. Come on. Guys, you are bringing the wrong energy to the mountain. You gotta let this go. Good vibes only, bros. Doing? What are you doing? So how are you doing? Honestly, I'm thinking another quiet Christmas alone is sounding more pleasant by the minute. I'll probably head home tomorrow. You know, they really are both sweet guys. It's just a crazy situation that is bringing out the worst in them. I mean, look at them. They're ridiculous. Dude, your chewing is killin' me. - What? - The chewing. It really is loud. It really is particularly loud chewing. I say you're all the way up here, and the roads aren't safe. The mountain air is fresh. The skiing is fabulous. Spend another day getting to know them. See what happens? You okay, baby? I don't even wanna look. He's okay, he's just... So... Uh, I think I'm gonna take off. You sure you don't wanna stay for dinner? No, I... I've had enough excitement for the day. Well, can I take you out for lunch tomorrow then? Sure. Okay, then I'll see you for lunch tomorrow. - Okay. - All right. Holly! Hey, wait up. Uh... Uh, do you wanna do somethin' tomorrow, like lunch or somethin'? Uh, I kind of already have plans. Tom? Of course. Well, what about dinner? Come on, I know the nicest spot in town. I mean, should we tell Tom? I don't really know how to navigate this whole thing. Nah, no. Believe me, this isn't our first dust-up. - It's cool. - Really? Yeah, he already knows. Has anybody see my wallet? So, uh, dinner? He's standing behind me, isn't he? Yeah. Yeah. All right, well... Bye. Bye. Come on! Look, I think you're getting ahead of yourself. Just relax. Take a deep breath. I can't believe this is happening. Vicky, they're brothers. Of course it's a big deal. Yeah, it's not like you're serious with either one of 'em. I just think I should go home. I think you're overreacting. Look, last week you didn't have any guys. Now you have two. It's not like that. I mean, sure, they're brothers, but that would be kind of hot. Vicky! Okay. All right, all right. Jokes aside, just let 'em take out, show you the sites. Maybe by the end of the holidays, you'll find love. Really? From where I'm sitting, it sounds like you have two Mr. Rights. Now you just have to pick one. Two Mr. Rights. Yeah. That's what I said. No, that was my wish at Santa's cottage. Well, not exactly, but I repeated it, and... and now here I am. You don't really believe in all that Christmas magic nonsense, do you? Hi. Oh, thank you. After you. Oh, thank you. I really appreciate you giving this a second chance, by the way. I know things have been a little tenuous the last few days. Yeah. This place is beautiful. Well, it's the nicest restaurant in town. So, um, I have to ask you, Holly, where do you see yourself in five years? What do you mean? Well, you're a very driven person. You're always working. I was just wondering what you're workin' towards. I guess I never really thought about it. Really? Yeah. I mean, honestly, sometimes I feel like I'm running away from something instead of running towards something. You know what I mean? What I do know is all your talking about running has built up my appetite. The Giardino here is fantastic. Do you like fish? I'll order it for us. It's great. You're gonna love it. - Hi. - Hi. Oh, wow, is that your car? Yeah. Sorry, I haven't had a chance to get the heater fixed. The heater? What about the doors? Don't worry, I got blankets. We'll bundle you up. Okay. - Hey, uh, Wright for two. - Mm-hmm, yep. - Follow me. - Oh great, thanks. All right. You're back. I... I mean, welcome to the Café Galleria. This will be your snow globe. Here, I'll give you a few moments to look over the menu. Menu? Wait a minute. Yeah. Your brother brought me here for lunch. Look, it's fine. I mean, this is the nicest spot in town. I don't mind. Lunch was really good. I'm sorry, sir, but a proper jacket is required for dinner. What? You must wear the jacket. Please. Oh, um. Oh, oh yeah, sorry, of course. I should have... Obviously, I don't come here too often. Could you? Yep. Wait, hang on, give me... Hold on a second. Thanks. Okay. Wait, there's some... Are you okay? Yep, it's not you. Excuse me? I mean, it's me. Actually, it's Tom, really. He's a good guy, okay. We just don't usually see eye to eye on things. We've got very different values and perspective on everything. I see. And, uh... And, uh? You know, it's just, guys like Tom, they shouldn't always win. I'm not something to be won, Austin. No, of course, it's not... That's not what I meant. This jacket, I... My hand is stuck in it, and I can't get it out. You're a disaster. You think? Do you wanna get out of here? Yes. Can we please? - Let's go. - Let's go. - Here. - This jacket. Go. Liz? Yes, what can I get for you? Tom. Liz. Oh my gosh, it's been so long. Yes, it has. You know, I don't think I've seen you since that night you made me wait three hours for the fall formal. - You remission that, huh? - Mm-hmm. That was not my fault. I should never have gone for the real bow tie. They were impossible. You are still stickin' with that story? I'm stickin' to it 'cause it's the truth. Okay. You look great, Liz. Thank you. How are you? How is your family? We're doin' good. I'm runnin' the family business now. Oh, how's that going? Um, well, you know, um, market volatility has challenged our investment strategy, but we're weathering the storm. Wow, impressive. - Is it? - Mm-hmm. Uh, you know, I have a proposition for you, Mr. Finance Guy. Okay. I have a bake that I need to get in the oven. So if you help me, then the coffee's on the house. It is a 100% savings. That sounds like a business opportunity I should not pass up. Besides, you look like you could use a cookie. Take that off. - Take, take this off? - Mm-hmm. Okay. All right. So, um, you know, I've never really baked cookies before. Really? Well, a little bit with my grandmother growin' up, but not much. - Okay, put this on. - I gotta wear this? Mm-hmm. Okay. What do we do with this? What do we do? Just put the down there? Yeah, right here, yep. Okay. - Wow. - See? - Wow. - Yes. Ah, so it doesn't stick on the thing. - Yeah. - I like that. Oh, oh yeah. Oh yeah, now we got a snowman cookie. Ah! That was a snowman! Oh. Oh, that's a tree, all right. Look at that. Yeah, okay. Let's... And that way. - Did I do it? - Yeah. So you work for a mom-and-pop business. That is not an easy business model. I know. I mean, the margins are just so slim, even in the best of times. - Totally. - Yeah. Yeah, gotta be a complete lunatic to own a place like this. I agree. Yeah, it's mine. - What is? - This place. I own this place. - This place? - Yeah. - This, this is, this is your... - Yeah. I love it. I love this place. - It's okay. - No, I do. I love it, I mean, it's... The decor in here is great, and the marketing strategy is great, and you clearly have best-in-class goods. Okay. Look, I bought this place for me. Well, I like that. We do have three very strict rules that you should know about. One, no fur unless it's fake. Number two, unless it's a dog, and then you're required to stop in and say hello. And number three, probably the most important rule, if the weather forecast calls for anything more than two inches of snow, then we are closed. Doesn't a sense of propriety ever sneak in there, Liz? I mean, you'd be closin' your doors at what I would think would be some of your most profitable hours. Well, that was the whole point of this place was for me to make my own rules. Look, I love what I do, and I pride myself on being the best baker I can possibly be. But I work to live, not the other way around. I guess I am a little jealous of Austin's freedom. And Seth, well, you know Seth. Oh. He's, uh, he's got a little too much freedom. Oh, Seth. Oh no, no. - No, no, no, no, no. - What? Uh, I gotta go. I got a family thing I totally forgot about. I'm late for it. Um, I'll see you soon. Yeah, I hope so. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. Video games are half price, everyone, half price. Oh, it's on. Okay, all right. Oh, you could put butter on anything, and it'd taste good. The more the merrier. Lather up my boot. It would be delicious. I mean, I was thinkin' more like a bagel, but sure. Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I was just, I was thinkin' a little outside the box. You're an odd one, Austin Wright. I mean, who doesn't have a cellphone these days? Me. I don't know, a landline works just fine. You could have the collective knowledge of the world at your fingertips. I mean, do you really just wanna check out like that? Check out? More like check in. I don't know. I just think they're just such a distraction. What if something important happens? How you gonna know? If it's important enough, I'll know. Although, you know, there is one important thing that's startin' to make me think I should get a cellphone. Oh yeah? What's that? I don't wanna miss another text from you again. Hey, guys! Hey, what are you guys doin' here? Tom called us, invited us bowling. What a coinkydink. I love it here. I love throwin' the old eight-ball down the wooden runway, just hangin' out with the laid-back townfolk. Hey. So great to see you both here. Ladies and gentlemen, it is 7:00 pm, karaoke time. Karaoke? Who's first, huh? Where did Tom go? Check, check, check. Can I get a little more reverb on this, please? Yeah, I got you, bro. Thank you, bro. Looks like Tommy's pullin' out all the stops. The question is, what are you gonna do about it? Everyone, this is going out to a, um, to a very special someone.

I am so sorry this has happened. You guys, I can't do this anymore. It's too much. I think it's clear I obviously bring out the worst in you. I don't wanna be the reason you guys grow even further apart. This is the time of year when families should be coming together, not fighting. You're brothers, and it's almost Christmas. Happy holidays. Look what you did! It got out of hand, Vick. Two men battling for you? Huh, that's the dream, Holly. Trust me, they did not look like men. They looked like two boys fighting over a shiny new toy. They're both great guys, but this is out of control. Okay, before the brotherly quarrel, who would you have picked? Well, Tom is focused and driven, like me. And Austin is spontaneous, sensitive. He's a mess. And I kind of love it. Wait, what did you just say? Well, not like that. At least, I don't think like that. Maybe I'm not supposed to be with either one of them. There's someone out there for you, even if it's not Tom or Austin. This was a huge step in the right direction. So what are you gonna do? I'm gonna spend Christmas Eve here alone, and in the morning, I'll drive back down the mountain. Really? You have made this such a special holiday for me, but it's time to get back to reality. I just need to go home. Well, let me know what to do either way. I love you. I'm here for you. Thanks. I love you too. Merry Christmas. May I come in? Of course. You got a little somethin' for the tea? Yeah, there's sugar, cream. I could find you some honey if you'd like. Somethin' a little harder? I don't think this cabin came stocked with Christmas spirits. Don't bother, there was enough spirit in the bowling alley tonight. How you holdin' up? I just... They're... I'm driving home in the morning. And? And I can certainly say it's been eventful. Well, good. Who wants to have a boring life anyway? Actually, predictable sounds pretty good at the moment. When I met my Raymond, Harry and I were still dating at the time. And Harry was a wonderful man. We had so much in common, way more than Raymond and I did. Harry was a musician. I was a singer. It seemed to be perfect. Raymond, on the other hand, and I were almost opposites. But that made our life so interesting. You know, he had his opinion. I had my opinion. Things would heat up. We would quarrel. But you know, dear, you gotta have the friction to have the heat. Look, Holly, Tommy is gonna be fine. He is very driven, and he's always gonna find a way to make something work, Austin, well, he's a very sensitive man. He sees the world different than most. You can say that again. And I see that you appreciate that in him. There's somethin' there. It's very special. And you both know it. But look, I'm never one to pry. It's just not my way. Do you know what ever happened to Harry? I don't. But I still think about Harry Shaw now and then. We had such a marvelous time together way back when. I just hope he's happy. Gotta get goin'. Can't let the horse get too cold. Sleep on it, dear. Before you go, give it one last shot. You'll be glad that you did. Yee-haw! I know I've already cashed in two Christmas wishes, but if I could just have one more, I just want everyone to be happy. Tom. Liz? Did you just close up? Yeah, well, there's snow in the forecast, so. So you definitely closed up. I'm sorry I had to run out on you the other night. I didn't want to. Can I walk you to your car? Sure. Okay. We're here. You know, I was actually thinking a lot about what you said the other night. About life. Oh yeah? You might have a point. Well, I made a lot of points. You gotta be more specific. When you said that I wasn't really living for myself, I was just living to keep up the status quo. Hmm, did I say that? Yeah. Wow, I'm so wise. Do you remember that winter in 2011, when, um... When it kept snowing and snowing and snowing. Yeah, yeah, and then the sun would come out, and we'd have bluebird powder day after bluebird powder day? You know, if I had had my bakery back then, I would've spent the entire winter closed. I bet you would've. That was the last time I felt free. Well, it's not too late. For what? To feel that way again. That's easier said than done. Mm, some things are better done than said. Goodnight, Tom. Thanks. Austin, how do you really, truly feel? You wanna know how I feel? I'll tell you how I feel. She's the first thing I think about when I wake up, and she's the last thing I think about when I go to sleep. But? But Tom is my brother. I just, I can't... I can't do that to him. I see. It's hard for me to admit this. But I look up to him. Always have. Have you told your brother how you feel? No, no, no way. Can't do that. No, even if I did, he doesn't care what I think. He doesn't care what I say. You know Tom. He's so ambitious, driven, confident. I wish I was more like him. He just took over the responsibilities when Dad passed, and that was fine, and don't get me wrong, I'm so grateful. But I just wish he wouldn't hold it over my head. Anyway, no matter how much I care about Holly, family comes first. Hey. Hey. How long you been standin' there? Long enough. I do care what you think. I'm proud of the man you are. I've always been envious of your ability to go after what you want in life. I wish I had passion like that to go after somethin'. You took over Dad's company and kept his legacy goin'. Those were some pretty big shoes you were asked to fill. And you did it. I could never do that. You help the family out in other ways. And steppin' into Dad's shoes was honestly the most convenient thing that I could do. I didn't have anything else. But all that hard work is the reason we're all together. I love you, brother. I love you too, bro. Let me ask you somethin'. What you said about Holly, is that true? Do you love her? Yeah, I think I do. I know I do. But don't worry. Family comes first. Exactly. So go after her. What? She's a really great lady. And you are the right man for her. - You serious? - Yeah. Better hurry up. I know she's plannin' on drivin' down the mountain. She's leavin' any minute. What are you waitin' here for? Go. - Go on! - Okay. Go get her, bro. I forgot my jacket. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, bro. Holly! I'm an idiot, okay. I should have at least tried to communicate to you the way I was really feeling. Look, I should have handled my brother like an adult. I talked to Tom, and we... I respect whatever you decide. I guess what I'm trying to say is you're the most amazing girl I have ever met. And I have completely fallen... Get a room, you two. Sorry. I wasn't talking to you. I hope you guys don't mind, I invited a guest. Like Grandma always says, the more the merrier. I got a surprise. I got a surprise. Harry? Merry Christmas, Betty. Hey, you guys! I got karaoke. Whoo!
