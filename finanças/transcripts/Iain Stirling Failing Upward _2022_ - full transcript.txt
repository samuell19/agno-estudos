Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining me tonight with my show, Failing Upwards, please welcome onto the stage, me! Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Oh, thank you London. Where do we fucking go from there? We've hit the high already. Thanks for coming. This is it, this is a tour, I'm on tour now. Uh, I'll be honest with you, the plan originally, uh, was to get in shape for the tour. Not the funny bit yet. I don't know if anybody else has had that, have you ever tried to get in shape for a thing, uh, and then the next thing you know, uh, you're, you're at the thing? I need to sort this out. Something that happened recently just made me realise I need to sort my life out, basically when, uh, lockdown restrictions were lifted, me and my wife, who was pregnant at the time, we decided to go out and celebrate lockdown lifting. So, we were going for cocktails in this hotel and for a meal in the restaurant. So we come out and I'd booked an Uber to get us to the restaurant, so we're walking towards the Uber, um, because I'm a gentleman, as we got to the Uber I opened the door of the Uber for my wife, my wife got in, I made my way round to my side of the Uber and as I made that journey, uh, that Uber driver, uh, drove away. So that Uber driver looked at me and my wife, both dressed up smart, walking hand-in-hand... and genuinely thought to himself, "Well fuck me, that chubby bellboy is keen, look at that... How badly does he want a tip? He's kissed her on the lips." "He's booked her an Uber, using his own Uber app." I don't know if anyone here has ever had their wife, um, abducted... via the Uber app. Um, but you can like live track the abduction. I was just watching this 2D car from a bird's eye view, drive away with my wife in the back, I felt like I was playing Grand Theft Auto One. I felt like Liam Neeson. I had to call the guy up, I was like, "Oi, Pavel, that's my wife, come back." Uh, I called him up, so let's think about that for a second. I called him, which means my wife is in the back saying fucking nothing. She's like, "Drive, drive, he's wearing his creepy tight jeans again, go on!" I bought these for the show, regret, they're too young for my head and too tight. Mate, you can see what religion I am, it's absolutely disgusting. Yeah, the Uber drove away, man. Punching above my weight, that's what I'm doing according to Twitter. My wife's never said it, I've never said it, but Twitter like to let you know. Twitter, the most aggressive place in the world. I think I know why it's got like that, it's because everyone on Instagram has to pretend how brilliant their life is all the time. We have to lie that we've never cried during the day, upload photos of our breakfast, hide the KitKat, I'm taking a photo of my avocado, 'cos we're lying about our life on Instagram, everyone on Twitter's going, "Let's cut these cunts down to size, thank you very much." Uh, because I'm on the telly very occasionally, I also get punching above my weight, uh, in the national newspapers! Doesn't happen every day, but when it does, it really brightens up a Sunday actually. Just sat there... "Oh, you seen this Laura? COP26, good, good stuff, the young people making changes, look at that, Papa New Guinea, fucking getting it about." "Oh, Laura, do you know Newcastle United? Yeah, Alan Shearer, yeah, yeah, yeah, been bought over by a Saudi Arabian company. Sports Direct immoral." "Saudi Arabia, fine apparently, 's fine..." "Apparently you should leave me." Not my words, the words of the Daily Mail. And they don't say expressly, they don't say punching above my weight, expressly, it's in the subtext. I get negged by national newspapers, imagine being negged by a national news... A photo of me and Laura and its description underneath is all negging. A photo of me and Laura and then it'll just be, "Laura dazzled in stunning lacy black number, she was accompanied by jolly comedian Iain Stirling." She's in the photo looking amazing, I'm in the photo, probably blinking. "Hey you guys!" Looks like I won a competition that day. Like I've been watching This Morning and I saw Peter Andre stood next to a caravan, going, "Do you want to win this and a chance to meet Laura Whitmore?" and I've gone, "Yes, please!" "I've won, I love all your shows, mmm, I've made a model of you out of ear wax, hello." She looks good in the photo, that's good. That's how a lot of women pick their photos. No matter how many people are in it, women look at themselves and then lie to everyone else that they like themselves in the photo. No woman in this room has ever seen another person in a photo in their life. There will be married women in this room that couldn't tell you what colour tie their husband wore on his wedding day. And girls on a night out, take a selfie, click... "Oh my God, Rosie, Rosie look, Rosie babes, you look, honestly you look amazing in this photo." Which basically means, "Oh my god Rosie, I look amazing in this photo and you happen to fucking be in it." That's exactly what we have, I smashed it, you were nearby, oh, lucky bitch. 'Cos generally speaking, I think women are the nicer sex. But when you turn, it's, phwoah, it's brutal. For example, gentlemen, listen to this, there are women in this room, a high percentage of women in this room will have a Whatsapp group, with all their friends in it. - Yes! - Yes. Again, that's not necessarily the world ending observation. "Yes, I've got all my friends on a Whatsapp group, this guy is a genius." "Say it again." "Finally, the comedy I came to hear." "I've got Whatsapp, I'm a woman, this is fucking unbelievable. Has he been following me around all day? I don't understand it." "I'm Whatsapping my friends right now, he's talking about us." You see, proof. I'm not wrong. Some women have a Whatsapp group with all their friends in it. They then have another Whatsapp group with all their friends less one of the friends. What do they discuss? The fucked up shit that bitch has said in that Whatsapp group. You're laughing, applauding it, applauding it. Applauding it. Some women applauding, I love two or three girls going, "I'm not got, um, Whatsapp." It's you, it's fucking you. You're the bitch. Yeah. Okay, yeah. I don't know what's happened. Loving it. Thank you. Thanks for that. You're all right. "You're all right", the kindest heckle of all time. "Go on Iain! Okay." Normally it's like, "You're shit," this is like, "Just checking in." "How are you emotionally? Are you all right? Have you slept? You look tired." I've, I've gone a bit, I'm a bit out of shape at the minute... You look great. Okay, I, right, I never have ever had to say this at a comedy gig in my entire life, but you're gonna have to stop being so nice. Because it's nice in the room, but on telly, just like people giving me moral support, doesn't really... Be like, "Was the comedian funny? No, but he was full of confidence, he was buoyant. He was well rested, he felt good in himself." I've put on a bit of weight, you know, lockdown, Being a dad, it happens, but I used to say I was fat on stage which is wrong, 'cos I'm not fat, I was using the term fat, like pejoratively to mean unhealthy, which is wrong, I feel bad about doing that, because fat doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy, that's a thing I've learnt. There's other factors at play, there's reasons you can be fat, like metabolism is a thing. When I was young, I didn't think it was, but I'm now older, I have watched my metabolism physically slow down, I know it's a thing. There'll be young people in the room, "Fat is about how much you eat and exercise." No, metabolism is a fucking thing. You're young, you don't understand, you'll go for a Sunday roast and two hours later play football with your friends. I can't do that. I go for a Sunday roast now and then I feel sad for a month. That's what happens when I go for a roast. "Can you smell gravy"? "Sorry, that was me. I had a lamb shank two weeks ago and it's still kicking about, actually." Fat doesn't necessarily mean unhealthy and the same with that thin, doesn't necessarily mean healthy. I know thin doesn't mean healthy, I'm from Scotland, I've seen junkies. There's some Scottish people in. I like it when there's people that are from a place that has junkies, 'cos I'm not taking the piss out of junkies. If you come from a place that has junkies, when you see one in real life, it's exciting. When you spot one in the wild, you're like, "I feel like David Attenborough, this is incredible." A junkie, first thing in the morning, never seen anything quicker. The quickly junkie, seven AM, just kicking about. Always crossing the road the junkie, have you noticed that? They're always crossing the... Always crossing the road and they're always talking to someone 15 metres behind them, I don't know what that's about. The junkie cry, "All right, mate." And another one comes out of Aldi with a Lidl bag, he's like... And believe me, I'm from Edinburgh, I know my junkies. We're told we're posh in Edinburgh, we've got Trainspotting, we invented the junkie. We've got the best junkies, Glasgow claim they've got the best junkies, Glasgow have got quantity, not quality, okay. There just seems to be this thing in the media of just picking on like minorities, vulnerable people, like they're slagging off fat people. Why are you picking on fat people? Leave fat people alone. Let's pick on thin people for a change. Let's pick on young, thin people, that's what we should do. People that are thin because they're young, but act like they've got some sort of fucking superpower. You see them online all the time, fitness experts, but you're young. "Hi there, like my YouTube channel for some more workouts." "Like this post for something secret." What's your secret? Being 21? Fuck off. When I was 21, I drank blue WKD every day. I could hear my teeth dissolving in my skull. But I was 21, so I just pissed out sugar and blue, it just came out of me. You've not got a thin secret when you're 21, come back when you're 33, eat curry most nights 'cos you're sad, then I'll listen to your thin secrets. I'm not fat, I'm not fat. I'm out of shape. I'm thin and fat. I'm thin guy fat. It's a male privilege. I just store it in one place. - I've got a weird shape body. - Sexy! Sexy, thank you, again, moral support needs to end. I'm a weird shape, I'm like thin, thin, thin, what the fuck? Thin, thin, thin, thin, thin. I'm front on thin, I'm 2D thin, I'm South Park thin. Do you understand? I'm a 32 waist, everywhere, apart from my waist. Does that make sense to you? When I wear jeans, I've got to wear them just underneath my hips or just below my tits, that's the only options. I've put on so much weight, I've started sweating from there. I've put on so much weight my stomach has got a forehead. I've got to get a Roger Federer headband backstage to put under there. I've always been self-conscious of my body, it's hard as a man to talk about that. I've always been a bit... I don't understand anyone that believes, has got that much confidence, you've got to hate yourself a little bit. I don't trust anyone that's like, "I think I'm great." Do you? Have you, have you heard yourself talk? Anyone that hears their own voice back on a voicemail and doesn't think, "Ugh, why is anyone friends with you?" I don't wanna take my top off in front of strangers, I've always had 'ittle bitty titties, I've always had them, I've always had moobs, man boobs, Toby jugs, I've always had 'em and it's held me back. When I was in my 20s, I once got invited to a sex party. I couldn't get my fucking tits out in front of strangers. I said this to the lady, she's like, "Don't worry about it Iain, it's gonna be a masquerade ball sex party. So everyone will wear a mask, we'll be incognito." I thought, "That's worse, I know I slag myself off, but I back my body, neck up." Anyone like me? Neck up. Mm mm mm, yes please. Oh, ten out of ten, neck though, urgh, no. Your body is split into like three bits like neck up, torso, waist down. Neck up, I'm, oh, I'm like a noughties boy band member who's made a comeback on I'm A Celeb. Waist down, oh my God, yes. Imagine me on Naked Attraction. As the thing came up... they're like, "Oh, look at that thin white guy with the massive dick." That joke works better when I've not got these jeans on. Um, and then my torso, like, "Brexit means Brexit," that sort of, I've got the torso of a man who should be wearing an England shirt. Not playing in the team, throwing plastic furniture at a Spaniard with a firework up his arse. So I'm not going to a sex party covering up my face, getting out my titties and then looking for sex, it's like counterproductive to me. Also, a mask doesn't work for me because I do the voiceover on a TV show called Love Island, right? So my voice is so much more famous than my face, I could go to a sex party, face out, holding my passport, no-one would give a fuck, but the minute I start talking, "I think I recognise that guy." I've only got this voice, I'm Scottish, it's the only voice I can do, I can't pretend to be someone else, like "Hi there, I'm Alexander and I'm an accountant." "Tonight at the sex party." "What are you guys up to... tomorrow night?" "Fuck, it's him, it's the guy! It's actually him, it's him, oh my God." So what are my options? To say nothing at a sex party. Mm, sexy. 'Cos not everyone is into sexy talk, but nobody is into the old sexy silence. Just picture it, me at a sex party, a pair of pants and a Michael Myers mask. That's the only mask I own, is a Michael... Halloween 2017, I'm not... if you think I'm buying a new mask to go to a sex party, to not get any sex and then have a new mask in my house as a horrible reminder of the event, you can fuck off. I'm wearing a Michael Myers mask. So it's me in pants and a Michael Myers mask walking up to couples saying nothing. I can only communicate through my erection, the ultimate puppet. - Yes/no questions only please. - Yes. No. Oh. My dick says no and my belly like backs him up. Like the worst hype man in history. No. No. No. Shut the fuck up, titties, no-one asked you titties. So it's now just me at a sex party, in the corner saying nothing with the other people that can't speak in case their voices get recognised. So it's me, the woman that does the Tube, and the guy from the Meerkat adverts, just... stood there like the Blair Witch Project. "Tonight", "Simples!" Shut the fuck up Sergei, we're trying to keep a low profile, mate, the cravat was a bad choice. I used to be, I used to be athletic as a kid, I got about, I was sporty, good as well, track and field, that was my choice. I was good, competitive level, you know, track and field. There's two ways to be good at track and field, you can either dedicate your life to train every day and make sacrifices or you can pick a niche sport with little to no competition and just do well at that. I went niche. Fosbury Flopper, that was me. High jump. Silver every time, there was only two of us competing in Scotland, it was fantastic. I'd look at the people doing the popular sports, "What the fuck are you playing at? Gordon, what are you up to?" "I'm doing a little bit of cross country running." "Cool, do you know who else likes cross country running? Half of fucking Ethiopia, so good luck to you actually, Gordon." Do you know what Ethiopia don't have? Ice rinks. So if you need me, I'll be curling actually... The haggis of sport, the curling. I'd go proper niche on that as well. I wouldn't do the popular bit, the hard bit, the thrower guy... I'm not that guy. I'm this guy. That guy's got a gold medal at the Olympics. Usain Bolt and then... And he's not even the worst one. If you've watched curling, there's the thrower of the stone, the sweeper, and then there's one fucking guy, at the other end of the ice, holding his broom going, "Um, if I was you, I would stick it there." "If I had done any training and knew what I was doing, I'd probably pop it there. Yeah, stick it there, yeah. Looks tricky for me, but if you can do it, then that's great. Where's my gold medal again? Can I...? Okay, just... the gold medal is over there, okay, can someone help me off the ice, it's slippy." I used to jump over a stick backwards, not once, not... Hundreds of times, every now and again I'd land funny, hurt my neck, at least it made sense. I've landed funny, I've hurt my neck. Now, two weeks ago I hurt my neck. You know how I done that? I woke up. That's what I did. I woke up, "I've hurt my neck here." "Did you sleep funny?" "Apparently I slept in a head stand, because my neck is done..." Jump over a stick backwards. And I'd land on a crash mat and just get up. I wouldn't have to think about it, in my 30s, if I'm sat in an armchair too long, I have to have an actual conversation with myself. "Iain, we're about to get up and about." Have you ever counted yourself in? "Three, two, one and up." "That's lovely." And I make the noises, ooh, oh, the sex... When I get out of a chair now, I sound like I've shat myself or ejaculated in my pants. "Are you having an affair?" "No Laura, I just stood up fast, sorry about that." I wanna get in shape, I do, that's what I wanna do, I wanna get fit. I want to get in shape for me, but also for my wife. I think it's good, give her something to look forward to. Well, a little light at the end of the old tunnel. I think it's important to give your partner something to look forward to. For any of us, especially if you're a man 'cos I feel like women forward plan a bit more than us, men don't do it, women extrapolate information. What you've got to realise if you're a man in a relationship, women, they add five years to your behaviour, they're constantly doing it. Every time you do an action, they're thinking, "If he's like this now," "what will he be like then?" "Okay, he's left a plate in the sink unwashed, five years from now he's gonna have an affair." I wanted to give my wife something, but I can't go to the gym 'cos I'm in my 30s and never learnt to use the equipment. And people that work in a gym are too young now and I'm not having a child teach me how to pick up heavy stuff, it's demeaning. So instead, uh, it's, it's very London of me, but I decided to go with hot yoga, that's what I decided to go with. Yeah, anyone here done the old hot yoga? Woo. Yeah, a few, it's more than I need, that's fine. You've got to remember, I wrote this show in Scotland. They don't know what yoga or hot is. You've got to explain it. "Do you know when you open the oven after you've cooked sausages and that air comes out?" "Right, that's yoga is it?" "No, that's hot, that's hot." Yoga, all right, the wee green guy from Star Wars. No, no, not him, not him. Have we got any Scottish people in? Woo! They've all spread out in case it kicks off. Whereabouts Scotland are you from? Fife. Fife? Are you actually from Fife? Yes. Yeah?! Oh my God. - And where do you live now? - Fulham. Lo... You've went from Fife to London? It's a fucking inspirational tale. Fife to London? Oh my God. You could have your own BBC 3 documentary. I know my London man, I've been about, I have. I moved to South London, know what I mean. Woo! People told me, "Oh, watch it Iain, it's rough. South London, fucking South London, rough." I lived in Richmond for a few years... and honestly I have no idea what they were talking about. It was lovely actually, I was like, "This is nice." I do love being Scottish though, man, genuinely, it's like my favourite thing. I question every aspect of my personality apart from the fact I'm Scottish. I love that we just think we're great, we don't need any evidence, we just are great. Scotland's the best, what makes you say that? We haven't got time, I've got to be over here. I love it. If you want to know what it's like, it's actually very similar to being English. Scottish is almost exactly like being English except when we go on holiday, uh, people like us. But apart from that... And if there's any Irish, Welsh, or Scottish people here, the highlight of our holiday, you get to your hotel in Spain, you're sat for your meal, first night, the Spanish waiter comes over and goes, "Ah, English," and you get to go, "Oh no, no, no." "Scottish," and they're like, "Yay!" Eyes light up, "Woo, Scotland! Three shots for Scotland!" You have your shots, too many drinks, you get pissed, you fucking wreck the place. We're just as bad but we don't do well in international football tournaments, so you don't know about it. I love Scotland. We've got our own TV channel, BBC Scotland. What an unnecessary, but at the same time completely necessary thing to happen. We've not got the time, money or expertise, but we're fucking giving it a go. I fucking love it. The thing about BBC Scotland you've got to remember is, when it first came about, I lived in London, so as a Scotsman, as you can imagine, I got so many phone calls from these like wanky London media, no offence, um... London media companies who'd just phone me up with these like wacky Scottish TV ideas. Like, "Hi Iain, we've got this idea, um, it's like the Great British Sewing Bee, but everything is tartan, we're gonna call it Kilty Pleasures." "Hi Iain, it's like the Great British Bake Off but we're gonna deep fry everything." I was half expecting them to go, "Uh, RuPaul's Skag Race?" The best one I got, it's from a guy called Nigel, Nigel called me from Who Gives A Fuck Media... I can't remember his name, he's like, "Hi there, Nigel here, um, huge news Iain, huge news, we've just bought the rights to an American TV format, we want you to be the host." Okay. "We've spoken to BBC Scotland, they're both very excited about it." "Iain, we want you to host The Bachelor Scotland." First of all, The Bachelor is too American for us. You know it's American, 'cos if you say The Bachelor to a Scottish person, we go, "Hmm, I like soup." The Bachelor is one of the most American TV shows I've ever seen in my life. If you've never seen it, there's one guy, a millionaire, he's a bachelor, he gets a mansion, he puts 20 women in it, they all fancy him, that's just taken for read, you're a woman, he's rich, shut the fuck up. It's mad. And then he makes them do tasks and takes them on dates, sometimes three at a time, and then just hands them roses and eliminates women one by one until there's one left like a sort of weird sexy Squid Game. It wouldn't work with Scottish women. The show would be half a day long, they would realise they outnumber the fucker, and they would rob him. It wouldn't be a show. It wouldn't. Ladies, do you want to join me in the hot tub? How about you give me your fucking pin number? Like it wouldn't be a... Also, he wanted to film it in the Shetland Islands. The Bachelor in the Shetlands. That's not a wide enough gene pool, mate. How does The Bachelor work in the fucking Shetlands? Just a man stands there, probably a farmer, 20 women line up. They all do a DNA test, whoever's not his cousin, he fucks her. It's not a TV show, okay, actually it's not a TV show. Nigel. The Bachelor Scotland, what's next? A Below Deck Somalia? Fucking... Anyway, the point I'm making is, I went to hot yoga. Anyway, I get into hot yoga and I'm putting aside all my male and Scottish elements. I'm just going, just enjoy the yoga, Iain and just give your wife something to... Just enjoy it. Nothing in here can upset ya. And then I met the woman that owns the yoga. And she was the most stereotypical posh London person you've ever met. She looked like she had a scarf on, but she didn't have a scarf on. Does that make sense? D'you know like a posh Londoner that's so posh she doesn't have a name, it's like a sound? "Hi there, my name's nmmhmm." You ever met someone so posh it sounds like their voice is coming from next door? Nnmmhmm ohnonioh. You know, you're in a hotel and you can hear the fucking couple next door flirting, rrroorrhhh, rrhhoohoo, ahhh ahhwee, rrrro. She sounded like that! Hi there, my name's hhhry. I thought, ignore her. Don't let it put you off. Just get the yoga done. Give the five years. So I'm getting my gym gear on, I don't go often, I've not got all the stuff. I don't have hiking boots and my waist fit and my smug sense of superiority. I've not got any of that. I've just got gym gear, so I'm putting on my joggy bottoms, shin pads. Going, excuse me, Raquel, is it an astro in there? Can I wear studs? What's going on? As I'm getting my stuff on, Raquel floats over. Hmmm. Just thinking about her inheritance. "Whnnnn, whnn, my parents have a two bed in a zone two, ooh!" She goes, "Mr Stirling, here at the yoga studio you must wear the yoga pant." I thought I'm not wearing pants in public, mate. I didn't go to a sex party. I'm not gonna overturn that decision for a fucking yoga class, do you know what I mean? I've not got a body for pants, I know I don't. Every day my body tells me, "Nope, no pants for you." Because I wear boxer shorts, not showing off, but I do. Do you know the waist band in a boxer short? What my belly has started to do, hmm, yummy, what my belly started to do is every time I sit down, what my belly does is it just grabs the waist band of my boxer short and when I sit down it just folds that bad boy in half. Like my pants are collapsing under the strain of my gut. Quickly, there's too much flesh, double up. Quickly, combine your forces. Contain the beast. And it's not like when I get back up my pants just spring back into action, they stay down like dead sad. Heee, we've been defeated. Also, I've been known on occasion to wear Calvin Klein pants and I'm quite a... - Ooh. - Thank you. And I'm quite a paranoid person, so I'm now convinced that like the pants are ashamed to be associated with my body. Every time I sit down the Calvin Kleins are like, fuck, he looks nothing like the guy on the box. Quickly, debrand yourself. Cover up the CK, this is affecting sales. Hurry. Just pretend you're from Matalan. Hurry, everyone. But I wanted to give my wife something to add five years to, so I have to buy the pants. I buy the yoga pants, 34.99. I'm fuming. And I'm in my pants, not feeling great about myself actually. Also, this isn't relevant to the show, but genuinely I felt as I was doing that act out the waist band in my pants... Literally as I done that, my pants, pdddfff. Yeah. Well observed. Pffhhs. So I'm in my pants, I feel brutal and I walk over and if you don't... sometimes they've got a little glass window into the yoga studio. You can look in like a pervy zoo. I'll have a look at what they're doing in the yoga studio. It turns out hot yoga is one of the most disgusting things that has ever happened on the planet. If you've never been before, here's what happens. If you've not got the equipment, you've got to use what is known as a communal mat, okay? Mmm, a communal mat. So, the guy in the class before you, he's got all the mats, hung up on hooks like meat in a Rocky film. And he gets one off the wall and pops it on the floor and pops a tiny towel over that mat and he just bends over the mat and he starts to bend and stretch and it's hot, so sweat drips from the end of his nose and just lands on the mat and then he drags his bollocks over the mat. And the class finishes and he gets up, hangs it on the wall, that's clean. That's mine now, that's mine. So, I have to walk into the class, get my communal mat, I put it down, I can still see the steam coming off it. I'm bent over this horrible thing and then Raquel every second exercise is going, "And place your face onto the mat. And breathe in." Oh, three day old vulva. Mmm. Is that my beard or someone else's pube? We don't know. Namaste. "Namaste at home." It's fucking disgusting here. It's absolutely gross. You are all gross. So, I'm now bent over this yoga mat breathing in piss fumes, trying not to shit myself because I had coffee that day and now I'm in my 30s, whenever I drink coffee I just immediately just shit now apparently. I have to drink coffee on a toilet. That is the only safe way to drink coffee for me. In my 20s I would drink coffee every day, morning, noon and night. Coffee, coffee, coffee. Now, in my 30s I walk past a Starbucks, I get a waft of coffee bean, and I'm like, pff, diarrhea. In Starbucks they've had to start hiding the fucking code to the toilet, that's how bad it is, otherwise there'll be people in their 40s going, "Let me in! I've had a macchiato! Jesus." You can't drink coffee in your 30s. As a man, you stop making friends in your 30s. I don't know if you know that. It's true. You stop making friends. You've got friends, don't get me wrong. You've got friends. You just don't make new ones. You will never hear a 38 year old man go, "Um, can we be friends?" It's never been said, ever. Women always pull back here because, you just, it's amazing you always make friends. Your whole life just constantly making more friends, it's impressive to see. My wife's in her 30s, everyday she went, "Off to the cinema on a random Tuesday, just the 48 of us." Where are your friends coming from? "Who's that?", "That's Penny. We met in a toilet. We got along." "We set up a Whatsapp group. Cubicle Kitties, we're pals." And women look after each other. On nights out. As a man I'm so jealous. You ever seen a group of women on a night out? Like ten of them. One of them drinks a bit too much white wine. Passes out. It's like you've all got walkie talkies. This military operation starts to take place, like, "Quickly, Emily is down in sector four. Make your way to sector four. Hurry. Grab her arms, grab her legs, grab her hair. To the toilet!" Emily's carried out of the club like she's been evacuated from Nam. Just... "I didn't actually have anything to drink, really." Emily's put on the toilet. Bleurgh, bleurgh. "It's alright babe. Alright. It's okay. It's okay, babe. Just get some water, some water. Get her water. It's alright, babe. Not cold water, room temperature. Fetch it! I'm not, no one's shouting. No one's upset. You've added a bit of fun to the evening, if anything. Ems, Ems... No one's shouting, babe. No one's, hello Ems, Ems, listen, Ems, Ems, Ems, listen to me, Ems. Ems, Ems, Ems, Ems, Ems, will you listen, Ems, Ems, Ems, listen to me. This is important. Listen, will you listen to me 'cos this is important. - Listen to me... - he left you. Because he's afraid of how amazing you truly are. I need you to know that. Any man would be proud to have you. Now take your handbag. It's full of your own sick, okay." As a man, you could go out with your best mate, he could fall down dead and you'd be like, "Ah, that's annoying 'cos I liked him. Um... Three pints, actually two pints. Oh, it's my round. It's my round. What a result, thank you. In your honour, Gordon, or Craig, I forget. But you seemed like a good guy." We've got friends, we just don't make new ones. Our friends become like this finite resource, like, oil. Just slowly whittling away. It's so true, men have had to invent new sports. Five-a-side football was invented by a man in his 30s going, uh, ten other people, where the fuck am I getting ten? It's not my funeral. When I am getting ten fucking people? It's not happening. Then into your 40s, tennis. I'll just hit it to Steve, there you go. That'll do. 50s, squash. Steve doesn't show up. I'll just hit it against a wall, it's fine. 60s, golf, golf, golf, stroke, dead. So, fun. Real fun being a man, actually. So I'm bent over this mat breathing in the fumes and my belly's so damp and the water's cascading down into my pants and my pants have folded over about 55 times. I've now just got this damp rag on. I look like Mowgli and Baloo. I don't know how I've got... The class ends and I'm all dehydrated. I pick up the mat, hang it on the wall. That's clean now. I'm going to leave the yoga studio and I'm thinking, "Lie to your wife, tell her it went well and you made a friend and give her something to add five years." I just want to get out of the studio, get dressed and go home. And I sort of stumble into the changing room and that's when I see a man in the changing room and he's stolen my shoes. London is amazing. See, he's stolen my shoes, but it's not a funny haha laugh thing. In most places in the UK, if you go, "A man stole my shoes", people go, "Oof, gosh, what? Wow. I can't believe that's happened." In London, I say to people, "A man stole my shoes." I literally watch you all going, "Well, where the fuck d'you put your shoes, mate?" "If you're going to leave shoes lying around, son, they're gonna go walk about, do you know what I mean? What, is this comedy or you're just learning life lessons? What the fuck is this? This is London, son." So I've seen this guy, and by the way, when I say the guy stole my shoes, I promise you, he hadn't snuck them in his bag. Hand on my heart, the man was stood in the changing room with my shoes on, doing that movement. D'you know the trying-on-shoes one? I was half expecting him to go "Excuse me, mate, have you got these in a ten?" Like it was, he was so confident. So the guy's there and I'm trying to walk towards him. Just trying to be normal, 'cos a weird situation I'm about to get myself into. 'Cos either I'm about to approach a man who's just innocently and accidentally put on my shoes or I'm about to approach a creep who just likes wearing other people's shoes. Like that's his kink. That's what he gets off on, trying on other people's shoes. That's what he does with his life, he just goes places where there's shoes lying loose, tries them on. He'll go anywhere that there's shoes lying loose. He'll go to the bowling alley, a bouncy castle, fuck it, he'll go down the local mosque. What, what a phenomenal reaction. I don't know if it's 'cos you're being filmed, but I just watched you all be offended and then think about it for a second. It was incredible. I just watched a room of people go, "No, oh no wait, they take their shoes off before they go in. It's a joke about shoes. Everyone calm down. Put your Guardian away, it's about shoes. They take their shoes off before they go in... yeah that's... I don't know why, they've had new carpets put in, I'm not sure." So I'm walking towards the guy, trying to be, be normal. This is a high pressure situation 'cos we're in a posh bit of London and I've got this accent. It is a nightmare. You don't understand, with this voice in London, people find me intimidating, I don't know why. I've mugged like four people in London by mistake. I was being friendly. Alright mate, I like your bike. He's like, "Please, just have it, I'm so sorry, please. Just take the bike. Leave my children please. God, take the bike." "I'd give you my money, but it's all tied up in property. So sorry." So I don't wanna get it wrong, I'm just walking towards him. I'm trying to be normal, which should be easy, shouldn't it, being normal? But it's impossible. I can't be the only person that walks about everyday just looking at other people being normal thinking, how have you, how do you make it look so easy? All day I'm just sat there stressing myself out. Am I being odd? I hate it, social se... every time I'm on a train I look around, I'm like why is no one else in this train late and sweaty, I am so late. Whenever I see a business man with a white shirt on, I just think, how have you not got sauce on your shirt. Whenever I'm in a button up white shirt, I immediately, "Oh, that's tomato ketchup. It's 8 am, I had Cheerios. I don't know how this has happened." Whenever I walk through a supermarket, everyone's got their Bag for Life. Everyone's got it with them. I've got a Bag for Life... It's at home! You know where my Bag for Life is? It's in the cupboard under the sink and it's just filled with plastic bags from every time I forgot the fucking Bag for Life. I'm too scared to go in there in case I open the door and Greta Thunberg comes out and bashes me in the bollock. It's so hard to be normal every day and then you get put in weird situations and your brain goes, "Be normal." And then it's game over. I see it when I'm doing gigs like this. I'll scan the audience and every now and again I'll catch an audience member's eye and you just see them, "I am normal audience member." There's a camera kicking about here. I've watched it go on people's faces and they're like, "I am enjoying it, yes." Have you ever walked into a room, like, for a party and you think you know people, you get in the room and you know no one. It's like your arms stop working. Um, pretend to text and leave. Have you ever been at a wedding talking to your best mate, stt, normal, and out of the corner of your eye you spot the wedding photographer. Yeah, that's great that. Yeah. He's like, we're just getting natural shots. If you could just natural. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, of course, I'm being natural. I'm natural. What was the Greg, mate? She's left ya. Oh man, I'm so sorry. Taken the kids, I can't believe tha... That's gotta, I'm gutted, I'm gutted for ya. Nice speaking. Um, the hardest place for me to be normal is in an airport. And I was trying to think, why do I get so angry in an airport and I realise what it is, I am just old enough to remember the golden era of the airport. Like, pre 9/11 when no one gave a shit. There'll be young people in the show, you don't understand. Pre 9/11 was like, "Excuse me, sir. Is that an AK47? Yeah. That'll need to go in your hand luggage, I'm afraid." The year 2000. The golden era. Back when people trusted unattended packages and Britney Spears' dad. It was... In the year 2000 I went on a family holiday to Lanzarote. I watched my dad walk through a metal detector drinking a two litre bottle of Lilt. Two litre. He's double handed that. Not watching where he's going, just, "There you go, son. I'm not even on the plane and already I feel totally tropical." But now airports are so stressy and airport security's so full on and it takes ages, so I get stressed out and I try and speed things along by getting ready in the queue, because that's what I am. There's two types of people on this planet: people who get ready in the queue at Airport Security and scum of the earth. Those are the two. And listen, and listen... if you are... if you're the scum that goes, "I'll wait to get to the grey tray", you're awful and you've ruined so many people's holidays. 'Cos I'm in the queue like I'm auditioning for the Full Monty... But I can't stop looking at all this scum. "Look at the size of that guy's bag. There's a laptop in that bag. Why has she got heels on? Why don't you take those heels off?" And the worst scum of all the scum. The person that makes it all the way to the grey tray... all the way to the grey tray and then it's like, "Excuse me, hello! Excuse me! Uh, where do you keep your small plastic bags?" They're next to a fish tank with a machete in it saying, "Don't bring a machete to the airport." So I do that bit absolutely fine. Don't worry, I saw him leave as well. No, wait, wait, he's got... he's got something to add. It's an old man bladder, you're brilliant. Old man... This is the nicest gig I've ever come on. "It's an old man bladder, you're brilliant." He's gonna come back in a bit as well. I don't know what to do. Are you with him? You are with him. How do you know each other? We used to live together. - You used to live together?! - Years ago. I was about to say, "Fucking hell! That's a London flat share right there!" What's his name? Richard... Richard what? His name's Richard. I thought you said his full name like he was like fucking... dead famous or something. What does he do? Uh, he works at Kensington Palace. He works... he works at Kensington Palace? Woo! Love that you all went "Woo". He could be a cleaner, we don't fucking know. What's he do at Kensington Palace? Uh, he's security, weirdly. Where the fuck was I? Shoes! Airport, we're in an airport. The shoes are... Oh my God, we've still got to get back to the shoes. The shoes are a pipe dream at this point, I don't need to tell you. I was trying to kill time till Richard got back but he's taking fucking ages. Prostate. - What's that, sorry? - Prostate. Prostate, cool, that's a... Cool. The loveliest man in the room walks out and only in London would you be, "That cunt needs to check his prostate." "I'm terribly sorry. I'm an old man. I enjoyed that but I had to leave for a second." "Check your fucking prostate!" "This is London, we're not having old prostates running around town. Up your fucking game, me old China! You fucking prostate, running all about town." Hurry, the fuck up Richard, for the love of God. S-sorry? If he has had a cardiac arrest you're gonna be fucking very... look very suspicious. Richard, please, for the love of God come back. And I think he's 100 percent just made it onto a fucking Amazon Prime special as well. Fair play son. Nicest man in London. Is he there? He's here, in you come, Richard. Get yourself out, son! It's a triumphant return for Richard! Richard, Richard, Richard, Richard... Mate, I never... I never thought I'd say this... I never thought I'd say this to someone that went to the toilet but thank God you didn't have a heart attack during that. Everyone loves you. Someone's got a little bit of apologising to do. How was Iain's Amazon Prime special? "I had... I had a piss and then a thousand people cheered. It was... the greatest moment of my life. Thank you very much." Anyway, genuinely, since you've been away, Richard, nothing's happened. You heard about the explosion at Kensington Palace? I'm joking, I'm joking! He fucking shat himself. He went... "Shit!" I thought he was gonna get a gun out of his pocket. Imagine he did have a heart attack, that would be it, game over. Who the fuck are you?! And scene! Thank you very much. Let's get this fucking shit going. Right, here we go. Now, I put my stuff in the grey tray. I turn away. I pop a left and then I see it. The metal detector and the male and female security guard. And I can hear my brain just going, "Quickly, be normal, hurry, be normal." And I'm just like... ooh, well, "How high do I put my hands when I'm stood still? 'Cos that feels high, that feels too high to be fair. And that's low; I don't understand. Why do my feet hurt when I'm stood still? Sometimes that happens, but when I'm on the move, my feet aren't that sore. Why am I doing that, I don't understand? My shoes don't fit. This is an absolute nightmare." And I've realised what's happened for the last... my entire adult life. Every time I walk towards a metal detector, at an airport, for no reason whatsoever, my brain just goes... "Don't walk like a terrorist." I don't know why! I was walking towards the metal detector, doing my "not a terrorist" walk. I start to question everything. I'm like, "My God, maybe I was wearing two belts. I know I... Ooh, earlier on when I sat down, I sat on a cocaine bomb. I know I've sat on a cocaine bomb and it's gone right up my bottom. Now I've got a bomb up my bottom. I'm gonna get in trouble. I'm gonna be nervous, gonna fart, not gonna sleep for a month. I know it! Meanwhile Sally-No-Bags is doing absolutely fine." Once, I was waiting for too long. The guy waved me through. I gave him a thumbs up. You think that's a trigger finger, mate, but actually thumbs up. So I'm walking towards this guy, he's got my shoes on. I'm just being normal, that's what I'm being, normal. The problem is we're in a posh bit of London and I've got this accent, right? It's a fucking nightmare. In Scotland, in Edinburgh, I'm seen as quite well to do. Down south, I'm like a fucking gangster. I've got that thing where you... you ever been overly polite? You get in a confrontation so you're... You're almost so polite, you come across as like, actually stupid. So I'm approaching the guy in my pants. "Hi... hi, there, hi. This is a bit awkward actually, and it might be me being a silly-billy... but I think you've got my shoes, um... on." And this guy just goes, "No! These are my shoes." And walks out of the yoga studio. He said it so convincingly, for about a second I was like, "I must have never owned shoes." That's the only... He just goes. I have to watch him leave. I can't run after him, I'm in my pants. I've got this accent; we're in a posh part of London. You can't have me running down Notting Hill High Street just going, "Give my fucking shoes back, man..." Load of Londoners going, "Oh, my God! Are they filming Trainspotting III already? And they're using chubby junkies. What a twist on the classic." So I have to watch him leave, and just so you know, he's not left his shoes. He's not got an upgrade; he's not left with my Nike Air Max, there's Crocs in the corner; there's nothing. He's gone. So I've now got to walk home. No shoes! Just walking through this... don't know if anyone here's walked on a pavement with no shoes? Men, no; women, every Saturday. That's the answer. I'm just walking up the road with no shoes on. Like Jesus, bare foot, up a hill, carrying my cross. It wasn't a cross it was almond milk latte, but... I'm just walking home. No shoes on. What the fu... For a long time I used to live on my own. But when I lived on my own it was fine 'cos I just had to justify my behaviour Me! And that's good... "I'm sorry, Iain, um, a man said they were his shoes. I had pants on. I sweat heavily from my nipples..." "Iain, I'd have done the exact same thing in your situation." "Thank you very much." "Thank you very much." "I love you." "I love you too." But I'm not going home to myself. I'm going home to my wife, who is pregnant and is currently... adding five years to "yoga Iain". She's got this image of me five years from now, bringing up children in different rooms with my stretchy yoga limbs. When, in reality, that angel has left me on my own for 72 minutes and I've returned home... with no shoes. We're about to have a baby. I can't look after my own shoes! I walk through the front door like fucking Frodo Baggins. She's like, "Where are your shoes?" "A man said they were his shoes. I had pants on, I sweat heavily from my belly. You know this about me." She's now got this awful image in her head of me, five years from now, coming home with a pram, but no baby. "A man said it was his baby! I had pants on, I sweat, and we can make another one." That was my chance... to add five years, and I fucked it. I was gutted, I was gutted. I thought I'll have one more shot. One last chance. So me and wife went out, I was walking down the road with her, she was pregnant. She looked unbelievable! Pregnant women are unbelievable, like fucking super heroes. If you want to feel insufficient as a man, get your wife pregnant. There is nothing you can do to help that situation. "I took the bins out today." "I grew an elbow in my womb." "Do you have a womb?" "I'll take out both bins tomorrow." If I try to help, it goes wrong. I don't want it to, but it goes wrong. I was trying to get a pregnancy pillow. Me and my wife were in bed. She said, "I need something to cuddle at night." I thought, "Have you been on Twitter? What's going on here?" I went to a department store, in London, to buy a pillow. I was in the childrenswear section, looking at baby shoes. They are so small, very easy to lose. I looked at the guy, like, "Excuse me mate, do you sell pregnancy pillows?" The guy misheard my accent, sent me down to the pharmacy and got me the morning after pill. What decision did he think I was making upstairs? The biggest decision of my life. "Let's see how cute these shoes are. Not cute enough, pill please. Thank you." It's not even a shoe, that's a sock with a Converse logo on it; you should be ashamed of yourself. So I was walking with my wife, pregnant, she looked fucking amazing. And I started looking five years down the line. I saw this life with this baby that I love and the only woman that's never told me I'm "punching above my weight". Yeah. I liked it. I wanted my wife to see what I saw. So we're walking and I said to Laura, "Laura, I need you to know this, right. It's getting serious now. I know that I can lose my temper. I know I've lost my shape and, yes, I have lost my shoes... worryingly recently, you could say, actually, yeah, pretty bad. But I promise you this, I will never lose the two of you." And she smiled, 'cos she knew I meant it. And then I opened the door of the Uber... Thank you. I guess what I'm saying is, If you're with someone and if you look five years ahead and you like what you see, they're probably the "one". So that's the one for you. Listen everyone, this has been one of the best nights of my life. Thank you so much for coming out. Cheers. goodnight, namaste. Cheers.
