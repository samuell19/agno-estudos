- Brother - That's crazy, man. That's so crazy. Bro, please I need a refill. Help me. - Guy, what's this? - Please. Thank you. Please, for me too. Thank you. So, as I was saying… Balling at 22… - A house at 25… - I feel you. You guys think I'm joking? - Why? Not at all. - I have it all planned out. Just watch me. You think I'm joking? I get you. Why not? - Why not? - You guys just think I'm joking. I'm for real. Bro, what's up with your brother? Is he always like this? C'mon. You mean from all these beautiful ladies at the party, he decides to play with a PlayStation. - C'mon. - Can we just ignore him? - It's actually embarrassing but... - Just leave him and let's do our own stuff. He is not disturbing you. Plus… Wishboy, that is not a PlayStation. That is a Game Boy. Anyway… I literally don't even know him. I don't know who invited him to my party. Who invites these randoms to your party, anyway? I don't know. Like he's literally just playing a game at my party, and killing the vibe. I have an idea. Hi! Me? No, the character you're playing with in your game. Of course you. What's your name? My name is Demilade. - I'm Amanda. - Amanda. Yeah. Everyone knows who you are, so… So how come you've never said hi? Girls like you don't usually talk to guys like me, so… - Really? - Yeah. Well… I saw you from across the room and… you just looked so cute playing your little game and I just had to come over and talk to you. So, is this like your favorite game? Uh… no, it's Uncharted. It's like Tomb Raider but like… I kind of like this one better. I know Tomb Raider. That's Angelina Jolie, right? That's the movie but not the game. She has really nice lips. I mean, people are always saying that my lips are as nice as hers. Do you agree? Yeah. They're very nice. So, would you say very kissable? Would you like to kiss them? Go on, then. Kiss me. My friend, are you mad?! This "Game Boy," you have some nerve. You're trying to kiss my girl? She asked me to. Asked you to what? You must be crazy, okay. You want to kiss, right? You want to kiss, right? You want to kiss. Kiss. You want to kiss? You will kiss today. You're going to kiss today. Game boy. Oh my Gosh! Hello, Demi. - Has it come out yet? - It's almost sold out. Just one copy left on the shelf. Mummy! Mummy! What happened? This man took the last disc. You should be ashamed of yourself. Madam, you don't understand. I've been waiting for this game for a year. So has my son. He's a game tester and we have been to eight different shops ‎looking for this game. Madam, I hear you but… from the look of things, it would be hard for me to give the game up for your son. Can you even hear yourself speak? At your age, you're here struggling with a 13-year old? You have no shame. I'm so sorry about all this, ma. Sir, please give the boy the disc. But… I'll have to insist you give the young man the disc. Here you go. Thank you, Amaka. Please, put it on our tab. - Okay, ma. - Yele, let's go. I noticed you hadn't come in, and the games were selling really fast. So I pulled one off the shelf for you. Oh my God. Thank you. What's so special about this game? I'm developing my own game and there's a new mechanic in this that will help me find the missing piece. Wow, nice. Alright, pay this way. Six packs of orange juice, please. Okay. It was so hilarious. All I remember saying was just "hey." I mean, he fell flat on the floor. - Are you serious? - I promise you. ‎lt was so hilarious. If I was there, I would laugh. Like, laugh throughout. Do you want some more wine? No. Are you trying to get me drunk? I'm okay. I mean, you just had one glass. And? Or could it be that you're intoxicated by my presence? I love it but no. I'm not. Plus you know I'm light headed. Yeah I know. What? No, it's nothing. It's just… Just that I really like you. The look in your eyes. And I really like the sound of your voice. When you laugh, when you talk… I was thinking, and it'd be really nice if, I wake up every morning and go to sleep every night hearing the sound of your voice… seeing your beautiful smile… and looking into your beautiful eyes. In essence, what I was trying to say is… What I'm trying to say is... - I am off the market. - Congratulations, girl. I am off the market! I apologise. This. Is that a yes? ‎Kneel down. Would you marry me? Ask me one more time. - Sophia. - Yes? Would you marry me? - One more time. - Sophia, would you marry me? Yes baby, I will marry you! I can't wait. My mum will be so happy. I'm sure. You cannot get married. - Ah. - Mama. Listen, Mummy. I do not understand. Am I mincing words or something? I said I'm getting married to Sophia. You're supposed to be excited. I don't get it. And I said what I said. You cannot marry yet. You cannot get married. At least not now. You know what, I think there is a misunderstanding somewhere. I was only informing you, not necessarily asking for your permission. I have proposed to her already. We've agreed… we're getting married this year. Informing me, right? Yes, Mama. Ah, God. Hope these children won't bring shame to this family. Mama, what is bringing shame into this right now? I thought you liked Sophia. You always... Oh yes, I like her. But, it's not your turn. "It's not my turn." What does that even, what does that mean? You have to wait for your older brother to get married first. - For Demi? - Dammit. - Okay, fire! - Fire! - Mark. Left side. - Left side. Come on. Demi is not even seeing anyone right now. Even if he starts the dating process, that thing takes time. And Demi is nowhere near… nowhere near ready. You still have to wait for him. Mama, don't be like that. - Is it this same Demi we're talking about? - Guy, I guess you need help. You didn't see that coming, did you? Hope you do realise that I whooped your ass. Calm down. Just take the beating. Take it. What is this rubbish? What? Bro, we need to talk. I'll call you right back. Tunde, what's up? Go back inside and put something on, my friend. Don't you know that you're a grown man? Henceforth, do not ever come out of your room without being properly dressed. Mama, do you see what I'm saying? He's still going to get married before you. No, Mama. That... That is the order of things. What am I supposed to do now? Like, Mum… Prodigal son has finally returned. C'mon bro, don't be like that. You know the nature of my job. Mr. I've-Scheduled-My-Whole-Life. "I've scheduled my whole life." Listen… Sophia said yes and we want to get married. So what am I supposed to be? Your best man? You see, Mama is not endorsing. I don't get. Why? She said it's not my turn. Turn? She's joking, please. What do you mean, she's joking. Have you forgotten who your mother is? No. If you want to get married, get married. Or she doesn't want to have grandchildren? And that's the thing. Apparently, you have to set the pace. That's the order of things. Remember Mama has always been like that. Remember when I wanted to sit down in front and I was like, "Mum, I'm sitting down in front today." And she's like, "No. Your older brother is sitting in front, because he's older than you. And that is the way things are done." Don't stress it, bro. It's fine. Let's go. Or the other time when we wanted to take a family portrait and I was sitting on the right and she pinched me to go to the left because my elder brother has to be on the right. "Because that is the way things are done." I was so confused. Or when I wanted to take an apple first and all of a sudden, she just spanked me. She was like, bam! And said, "Oh, your brother has to pick first because that is the order of things." Bro, I've been suffering this thing from time. Damn, you're screwed, bro. Bro, listen… Can you at least consider finding a wife? Maybe if it's even to help me out. You don't understand. Look at me. Who wants to get married to me? It's not like I have the kind of money that can attract women. Bro, all my life… All my life I've been there for you and this one time that I need you to do something for me, you're still making a joke out of it. C'mon. Listen, bro… I'm sorry. I can't help you. Hey, husband. What's going on? She said no. What…what do you mean? You said she was going to be excited. Yeah I know. That's what I thought. Okay, what exactly did she say? I mean, this doesn't make any sense. Calm down and tell me exactly what she said. She said… She said something about waiting for Demi to get married first because he's older and… that's the way things are supposed to go. Wait, what? So what, are you supposed to just be a bachelor for how many years? How long are you supposed to wait? I wonder. Babe, you and I know that Demi is not even on God's marriage register. Babe, did you tell anyone yet? Are you kidding? Everybody knows. It's all over social media. Thanks to those girls. What are we going to do? Babe, you know what? Let's just calm down and I'm going to trust that it's your mum. It's your family. You know how to get her to come around, right? You know what? I'm just… I'm just going to take this off. You don't have to do that. Guys, chill. I'm just working on the game mechanics. Trust me, it's going to be dope. What's wrong? I haven't figured out the submission yet. And the deadline is tomorrow. I might as well give up. I'm not good enough. You're my big brother. You will always be good enough. I don't know coding but I'm here with you till you figure it out. Demi. - You can do it. - Thank you. As a leader in the family, you are good enough. Thank you, Tunde. Thank you, Mummy. You're welcome, my dear. To the champion! The best coder in the world. Counting down… Five, four, three, two, one, and you're live. Alright, welcome back. It's still the Good Morning Naija Show. And yes, right now we have a special guest that wants to speak with us. Demilade Adeshola. Bro, how're you feeling? Wow, it's good to have you. So, tell us, how do you feel to be one of the most celebrated game developers in the world? Ah, it's an awesome experience. Our video games are distributed around the world. I can honestly say it's the most fulfilling feeling ever. And the fact that you have no wife or kids to inherit all of your legacy doesn't bother you? No, not at all. My brother, Tunde and his family will inherit my legacy. Well, that would have been possible if you had let your brother get married and start his own family. Demilade, you're a mess. Demilade, your life is boring. No wife, no kids, you will die a lonely man. - You will die a lonely man! - You will die a lonely man! - You will die a lonely man! - You will die a lonely man! No! No! Hello, Demi. - Hey, man. What's up? - Hey. Hey, Tunde. You're here today? It must be Christmas. Look Mr. Pato, they want to kill me with work in that office. It's not easy. Youngest ED. Right. So, how is your mother? Great. She liked the peppered snail you sent. Nice one. Alright Tunde, I will send your wine over. Ah, thanks P. Meanwhile, let me leave the two of you to enjoy yourselves. If you need any other thing, just signal. - For sure. - Okay? Thank you, Pato. Tunde, how does Sophia feel about Mum's decision? I'm not going to lie, she's not taking it lightly. You know I admire you a lot. You set a timeline for yourself since you were younger. If I remember correctly, you always wanted to get married at 30. Here you are now, about to get married. Well, it's not looking like that is going to happen. It is. Don't call off the engagement. I'll help you get married. And how exactly are you planning on doing that? By getting married. Be serious. Tunde, you've always been here for me. Your life cannot be on hold because I haven't recovered from a broken heart. I'm not just doing this for you. I'm doing it for myself, Mama and Sophia. This man deserves not to die a lonely man. Wait, you know what? Never mind. Are you really serious? Because if you're serious then… I guess… we need to get you married. Where do we start? So you're a gamer, right? Now the key to being a good gamer is you have to be able to identify your prey. Right? So let's… Now, let's… Let's start with her. No way. What's the problem? She's not cute enough? Cute? She's hot. Okay… So, what's the problem? The problem is that girls like that don't look at guys like me. - Ah. You're a gamer, right? - Yeah. Go and play the game. Remember, confidence. Screw it, you have… He has pepper on his head. What? My mum has cancer. I'm sorry. And she wants me to get married before she dies. And, why are you telling me? Will you marry me? It'll really mean a lot to her. You don't even know me. No. But you're hot, and you have nice breasts. Just like Triss Merigold from The Witcher. The video game. You know her? Who doesn't know Triss Merigold from The Witcher? I mean she's, you know, a popular video game character and... I have nice breasts, right? Cancer. Really? Bro, I was trying to play a sympathy card. Using our mother. You know what? I can't believe that I just sat here and witnessed that. I don't exactly have a golden tongue. Golden? Alright. Like silver. But who doesn't know Triss Merigold from The Witcher? Bro… It's nothing close to silver. Nothing close to bronze. More like brass. The truth is I never know what to say to girls. Whenever they look at me with those killer eyes, I think… Is my hair okay? Does my shirt look nice? Do I smell okay? Look, while you were in there making a fool of yourself, I managed to stumble upon this. I don't do hook ups. Not like you have a choice. Please can you wipe this pepper off… off your head, because I'm about to go mad just looking at it just now. - Oh. - It's still there. No wonder she ran away. It's still there. Aw, fuck. Okay. Um, take care of yourself, Tayo. And best of luck with Timothy. Alright. Howdy. Hi. Gentlemen! It's okay. Don't be scared. Today is the first day of the best days of your life. You can't stand out here and find love. So, gentlemen come in. Come in. "Howdy." Really? He can't be serious. Bro, don't judge a book by it's cover. Let's go in. So that we can… Okay. Shall we begin? Can you please take off that hat? Yes. it's a bit weird. It's okay. No problem. So… What is your case? No, actually um… We are looking for a wife. We don't do that here. Bigamy is against the law. And our service permits only one spouse - for a person. - Right. No actually, what I meant was ‎I have a wife, or a fiancée ‎hopefully, if this works out. We're looking for a wife for my big brother here. Really? Well… We do a premium dating plan. But what I cannot guarantee is that… if you skip the process, I cannot give you a wife. Yes, I understand that the dating is also a very important process. But, the thing is… We need a wife more than we need a date for him. Duly noted. But I will advise you keep an open mind. And expect the worst. Trust me, 97 percent of our clients are married now. And we give discount on wedding planning. Single female, 27, highly religious, seeking male 25 to 35? That's it? You meet the criteria, I assume? That's me and about 50 million guys in Lagos. But what those other men don't have is that card that only I can provide. Okay, um… can we see some of the girls in your catalogue please? See, ‎our system ‎relies on compatibility ‎over appearance. And if you're actually trying to choose somebody to spend the rest of your life with, I think… you should go beyond physical looks. Okay. I will… make you… Fill this. And I will hook you up. Do I fill it or do I give him. - Oh, sorry. - No, it's fine. You, fill this form. And I will hook you up… with some nice ladies that match your search pool. Okay. Um bro, I guess it's time to suave you up. What?! Do I have to use gaming terms to explain everything to you, bro? ‎Turn off. He's wearing it again. So basically, it's like a first-person shooter game like Call Of Duty. But then it's based on African mythology. So there are different gods… and basically one of the gods are, maybe like Sango in Yoruba And there's also like, in Egyptian mythology like, sort of like Rameses But then, the thing is that like, different people can play in... Oh wait, just hold my waist. Yeah. - So you see... - Just do it, quickly. So you sort of have like, different gods like Sango. So, as you're playing like, one time like, you can connect with other different players and like, have conversations. But then it's also like, varied. And a basic... Ah, what's going on here? What is happening here? What's all this? Who are you with? Who is this? - Oh. There you are. - Yeah. My baby here now owns all of this. My baby, meet my ex. Nice to meet you. Wait, is that jealousy I see in your eyes? Well, I'm sure you will not go out with this dirty thing. Okay? Do you get me? Yes. You know, think about it. You can't imagine yourself living here without me, right? Well I guess I'm stuck with you then. - Bye, loser. - I'm sure you know that. Yes, sweetheart. Look at you, wow. Ah! Spend my money. Emeka! My name is Demilade. - Who is Emeka? - Jesus Christ! Are you even joking, like.. Finally we meet again. What are you talking about? You are a very pathetic and heartless person. You are the worst I have ever met. And I can't believe you did that to me because… till today I can't even get over it. You're wicked and you're heart... I am Demilade, not Emeka. Mister Wakili. Can I ask you a question? Okay. Is this how you eat in real life? As in, normally? Is this how you really eat? Right? You are eating like a dog. Do you have a dog at home or you are the dog? I blame myself. I should have asked for your botanical name. I didn't know "dog" was your surname. Ah, Jesus! They might have told you before but let me tell you again. You are eating like a dog. Ah, sorry. You are actually a dog. Sir! Honestly, I'm just looking for something open. I mean, nothing too serious. I want something serious. My darling, I'm married. Sorry. ‎I'm just looking for something open. ‎-I mean nothing too serious. ‎-Are we going to get along? ‎-…the most I've ever met. ‎-…you see? It was a great date tonight. I don't usually meet a lot of nice girls in Lagos. - Really? Why? - Yeah. Oh, they are just so crazy, you know? Really? Wow. So… how did your night go? You said you liked it? Yeah. Oh wow. This is really fast. I love my men loyal. Ah. Okay. You are more of a German shepherd like me. - I am? - Yes. Oh, wow. Um... I love my men very loyal and faithful to me. - Are you? - I guess so. You guess so? Or you're more of a pit bull? Excuse me? Are you more of a pitbull? Excuse me? - Bark for me, baby. - What?! Bark for me. I'm sorry. Um, I have… Bark! Bark! - There's something... - Kneel. - Okay. - Kneel. Just one second. Um... Kneel for me. Bark, call my name! - What's wrong with you? - Okay, okay. What are you working with? Okay, I'm doing whatever you wanna do. Kneel and bark. Call my name. What's wrong with you? I thought you were feeling me. - I am feeling you. - Are you? - Just one second, I'll be right back. - Where are you running to? I'll be right back. Raven? Yes. Oh thank you. Red. My second favorite color. - What's your favorite? - Black. - I see. - Please. Come in. Sit with me. Do you believe in immortality? - You mean like not dying? - Yes. Can't say I do 'cause I know a lot of people who've died. Death is all about perception, you know. So is love and immortality. - I've been told I'm not too perceptive. - Well, you know I can… - …change that. - Oh. Yes. I can open your eyes to a… - whole new perception of higher ecstasy. - Oh. ‎Let me see your hand. Perfect. Jesus! Men are always scared of what they don't understand. Henceforth, you will attract only godly women. Amen. Witches will never see you again. - Amen. - Vampires will not come your way. - Blood of Jesus. - They cannot do anything to you. In the mighty name of Jesus I have prayed. - Amen! - Amen. Amen. Thank you, Mama. You're welcome. Mr. Scaredy-Cat, - can we go now? - Go in peace. You will meet a very lovely lady. Yes, Mama. Er, Sophia. Yes, Mama. I beg you to be patient. You see, in this family, we respect tradition. You know I love you. I love you too, Mummy. - But we just have to follow the right... - The right order of things. Bye, bye. Please let me go and change first. I'll come and join you. Sophie, take care of the boys. Yes, Mummy. - God bless you, my dear. - I'm on a call. - My roomie is upstairs. - Okay, baby. - I'll see you. - Alright. I don't like this place. Hold on. It's just getting started now. I'm not feeling it. Do you want to go somewhere else? I will go and wait outside. No, wait by the bar. Let me get her. What can I get you, sir? Orange juice, please. I'm sorry, sir. We don't sell orange juice here. But I can get you something very nice. Cocktail? Uh, mocktail. No alcohol. Coming right up. Are you trying to kill me? This is not for you, sir. I'm sorry. I actually like it hot. What was that? Scotch bonnet pepper juice? No. It's a Bloody Mary with lots of vodka and… chilli pepper. Don't I know you? No, but… we have met earlier this week. I'm Tayo. Dream Dates. Howdy? - Howdy? - I'm Demi. Yeah. Nice to meet you again. You look… different. Are you on a date? Well, I put in a lot more effort to look good. Nice. Well, I'll give you an E for the effort. Thank you. So what happened to your date, Tim? You remember his name? Well, it's hard to kind of miss out Larry's words to a beautiful lady. To be honest, it's not going so well. Really? What's wrong? He went to the restroom about 45 minutes ago… Leaving me to believe that he is either having explosive diarrhoea… or he has fallen into the toilet. Or maybe he simply bailed out on me. I love your sense of humour. Can I get you a drink? Okay. Bartender, another round of this throat-killer for the beautiful lady. So I was standing in the game shop with the latest version of the last Call Of Duty. Then this rich kid walks in with his mother and points to my game, and says he wants that one. I obviously wasn't going to let him have it. So we started struggling until the shop girl came to diffuse the situation. I probably would have done the same thing. So wait, you are not judging me for that? Usually when I tell the story, many people look at me like I'm some insensitive man-bully. What's there to judge? We all have that one thing that we will die fighting for. Oh. And what is that for you? Love. I hope your date is okay. Tim is gone. Thought you said he went to the toilet. Maybe that is his way of leaving without saying goodbye. Well, his loss. They don't abandon a beautiful lady like you. So… what kind of girls do they abandon? Well… No girl deserves to be abandoned. No human deserves to be treated badly. Are you alright? Well, I've had my share. She treated me badly at a house party. It was as if that house party was made to humilate me. I honestly thought she was interested in hearing about me and my video games. I'm sorry. I shouldn't be talking about video games with a girl like you, if I could stand a chance. It's alright. I play games too. C-O-D, especially. My neighbor Kelechi, he's a game tester. He grew my love for games. So asides from getting embarrassed by a woman, what else do you do? I'm a video game developer. I'm currently working on this new RPG game based on African mythology in history. Wow, that's interesting. So I'm guessing this game of yours is about… Sango and Queen Amina, right? - Yeah. - I'd like to play that. I'll love to show it to you too. So… what do you do? I'm a data analyst. Funny enough… I am currently looking into current game trends in Africa. There's a lot going on in that space, especially with the Metaverse, you know. That's amazing. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'll be right back, okay? Oh, baby. ‎That's something. ‎Skinny chick. ‎She's a skinny chick. ‎There's something there. Wow, see who we have here. You don't want to mock me, do you? Calm down now. See, I can see you're having a great time. After you've explored all the sweetest girls in my catalogue. You need to find another job because you suck at matchmaking. Come off it. I'm a love expert. Perhaps, you don't know what you are seeking for in a woman. I know exactly what I want. You know what you want? Okay, aren't you supposed to be on a date with Raven? That date, just like every other date lasted two minutes. ‎And I believe you know why. Two minutes? That's too hasty. Not when she tried to bite me. Bite you? Wow, that's freaky. No! That's scary. You don't understand. This isn't one of those things women do to chase men away. She was out for my blood. Wow! Wow! That's my kind of girl. But trust me, I… I am not expecting her to do that. Not after ‎she described herself as highly spiritual. Well, if you take into account that she dresses like a Goth and her name is like a bird, then you will understand how spiritual she is. Easy. Don't touch me! You need to be more specific about the kind of people you introduce to your clients. Collect more details and maybe verify them first before trying to hook them up. Okay, fine. Noted. I'm sorry. I apologise for the unsucessful match. Okay? I will make it up to you. I will make it up to you. Okay, so um… How about you come to the office tomorrow while I arrange some interesting options for you. Don't bother. I can survive without your services. No, Demi. Demi! Let me fix this for you. Let me fix it. ‎Raven! Babe! Babe! The way you move around… Hey, Demi! Where have you been? I've been looking for you. We wanted to introduce you to… - someone. - Yeah. Maria, meet Demi my brother. Demi, Maria. Hey, Demi. Sophia has told me so much about you. - Hi. - Hi. Wait, where were you? I've been looking for you all day. I've been here. All by yourself? No I was talking to a girl at the bar. That's very interesting. A nice lady? Yeah, she was here a minute ago. What now, she didn't ditch me, she just left without saying goodbye. Technically, that is another word for ditched. But anyways, I'm here to make up for your loss. Come, baby. Come give me a hug. I heard you wanted to go somewhere else. Sure. Shall we? Okay. Come. Right, baby girl? Later. Wait. What is going on here? Nothing. I mean, okay, Maria said she's been seeing Demi around and she wanted me to do an introduction. Come on! It doesn't happen like that. A girl like that can never be loving up on a guy like this on a normal day. - What is really going on? - Wow, Tunde. Can't you be happy for your brother? He's found a girl that likes him ‎and I mean, ‎she's going to take him off the market. Okay. I mean a guy like you can have a babe like me. Why... - What do you mean by that. - I mean that... Please let's go. - A guy like me? I'm a spec. - Yes. Who are… Are you alright? Um, yeah. 'Cause you're not saying anything. Well, I don't have much to say. Anything is better than silence. Okay. Well… Since Sophia said stuff about me, what did she say? She said you were a nice guy. Is that all? She said a couple of other things but you know, girl code… so I can't disclose. I see. You know, I know a lot more than you are telling me. - Ow! - Oh. That doesn't look good. No, it doesn't. Well, I can break the other pair and we can make a matching set. Okay, now your fashion sense is questionable. These are new Louboutins I just got yesterday. Does it look like I know about fashion? I'm just trying to make light of this situation. It's fine. Now I can't… …go out with you. I just have to go home. I apologise for being insensitive. It's fine. Never mind. Apology accepted. Give me your phone. Okay. So… talk later? Sure. Okay, that's him. Okay. - Its good - Bye. Oops! - Bye. - Bye. ‎Oh my God. Ow. What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Drinking bubble tea. So you ditched me for bubble tea? I'd rather have ice cream or orange juice. Just so you know diabetes is real. Besides I didn't ditch you. You did. I came back and after two minutes you were gone. I went to the restroom and by the time I came back, you were with another lady. Come on. She's no one. Look. I'm sorry I left in the first place. But I saw Larry and I wanted to give him a piece of my mind for trying to hook me up with horrible dates. Larry? Yeah. He was going on and about trying to hook me up with someone, but I told him not to bother. I already met someone cool tonight. Someone. Who? She's sitting pretty in front of me. Listen, Tayo. I really liked talking to you tonight and… I want to get to know you more. I'm sorry, Demi. It's just that… my bad past dates have made me… expect the worst from men. Come on. I'm not like other guys, and… we are not exactly on a date. I know, right. Let's make it proper. Truth is done. I dare you to kiss Demi. Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, you already know that, what we've been talking about. This game is basically a first-person shooter based on African mythological histroy. There are different levels to it and people can connect. You've got your Rameses, Sango, different people within the game. And I think it's going to be great and you are going to love it. Alright. Thank you very much. Thank you. Just sitting down and spending time with you has brought back some stuff that I didn't think I will be capable of. You are the first guy I have ever felt genuinely and totally comfortable around. I feel the same way too when I'm spending time with you. Let's take things easy and see where it goes. Okay. So, would you like to have dinner at my mum's next weekend? Oh. You want me to meet your mum? Absolutely. It's just that nobody has ever asked me that. Well, I'm asking you now. Will you? It will be my pleasure. Awesome. So, what's the deal with your friend Maria. Maria, there's no deal. What do you mean there's no deal? Your friend Maria that we know that only likes rich… handsome men, is all of a sudden falling for my brother. There's something off with that. Babe, there's nothing off. Maybe she's just, uh… done with rich and handsome men and now she probably wants commitment. She wants something serious. - Yeah, but... - Babes, no but please. At least be happy. We're getting Demi a wife. Okay. Can I ask for a favor, babe? - What? - Please. Say you will promise to do it. What is it? Can you please flush the toilet twice? How many times do I flush normally? - Once. - It's not even that bad. Oh, I am trying to stay alive. Go away. Ooh! Goodbye. Robby Joe! You're rocking it. I like that. My guy. How are you? Demi. All the excitement is unmistakable. I mean you can't hide it. Why are you so happy like a child who has some sugar rush? You have found a woman. I've not just found a woman, I've found my missing rib. I knew it. She's beautiful, smart, wise. She's the perfect match for me. She's also helping me with my investment pitch for this game I'm developing. She makes me feel so alive again. So happy for you, son. And I'm sure your mum must be… glad too. Oh no, I haven't told her. But why? You should. Pato, is that a new watch? That looks amazing. Jesus! You scared me. Have you found a wife? Isn't that why you have been going out often these days? Now, sit. I want to talk to you. Mummy, I met a girl at the club. God forbid. A club is not a nice place to look for a wife. Says who? How do you think Tunde and Sophia met? Okay. This nice girl you met at a club… does she think that you're a nice man too? I think so. You think so? So… Ask her to marry you. Mama, not so fast. I have to get to know her before I ask her to marry me. How many times have you met her? - A few times. - That is enough to make a decision. See… my meeting with your father was an arrangement made by my parents. Because they thought I needed to get married before my younger sister could. And… meeting your father… Boy! It was love at first sight. No way. Yes. We just spoke for a few hours and he asked me to marry him. Just like that? Just like that. Mama, how come you've never told me this story before? Because there has not been an opportunity to tell it. See, my son… if you really like this girl, and you're sure that she likes you too… marry her. By the way, I asked her to come over for dinner this weekend. I hope that's okay by you. Finally! Finally! Mama. Is that a new watch? I've never seen it before. Just bring her home quickly, okay? Bring her home, before you destroy yourself with sugar. Yeah? Goodnight. Demi, what are you doing? Uh, nothing. What's up? You have been cleaning this house like a mad man. What's the concept? No concept. Bro, relax. Okay? The house is clean already, thanks to this your recently developed OCD. I'm just nervous. But I thought you said this particular girl doesn't make you nervous. She doesn't. I'm just anticipating her arrival. You had better relax. How long are we going to be calling her 'this girl'? What's her name? One time, we'll say "her," one time we'll say "she"… Oops! Looks like it's time to finally meet her. Just relax and open the door. Go. - What do you want? - Demi, um… See, I'm here to set things right. Okay, um.. Trust me and I'm ready to give you a perfect date experience. See… Obviously, I know you were not pleased with… the previous matches but I'll make it up to you. Trust me. You can make it up to me by staying out of my life. No, I can't do that. No, I can't do that until I fufill my purpose in your life. See… at Dream Date, our customer satisfaction is our first priority. Trust me, I'll make it up to you. And then, look, you're one of the two male clients that I have. Wait, what happened to that 97 percent success rate you were talking about? May God not take your joy away. It's all branding. See… Look, I… Trust me, I need you to help me do this work. Let me do this work so that I can have more male clients. Your services are far from providing customer satisfaction. Wait. Take things easy. Okay. How about I satisfy you with… Hello, handsome. Jesus Christ! What are you doing in my house? I asked her over. For what? To fix the relationship. Get her out of my house. You can see how she miraculously appeared here. Miracle, indeed. The back door was open. I just walked right in. Get her out. Now. Mama! Mama! What is it? What's going on? She is the vampire. She is a very nice lady. And then she is here to help you solve your problem. Help me? I will be your wife, Demi. Wait, what? Yes. I've already spoken to the highest circle leader in our realm. He's agreed to marry us. By the great river of love. And once married… we will share a love beyond eternity. You? Share love with me by biting me? I'm afraid it's a necessity and a requirement to bind our souls as one. God forbid. I'm not interested. Wait. Did I… Did I hear her say that she'll be your wife? Yeah. Then that means all our problems are solved like... Our problems? Okay, sorry. Bad joke. Listen Tunde, I'm going outside for fresh air. Come with me. Great. I'll leave them to you. Okay. Let's just… come in, wait for him. Because it's pretty hot out here. No, you heard what he said. You guys need to leave. Blood of Jesus. Wow. Hey, babe. What's going on? I thought I heard Demi shouting. No, nothing. It's just a little misunderstanding. - Oh, okay. - Where is he now? He went to the store. He'll probably be back before his date comes by. What… Will you stop that thing! I'm coming. Let me see who's there. Alright. Hey, Tunde. Hey, Maria. You're here to see Sophia? No, I'm here for dinner. For dinner? Don't tell me you are the one that is having a date with Demi. Why was everybody making it seem like a surprise? - Surprise? - Yeah. They refused to tell me it was you. - Where is Demi? - Please come in. He went to the store to get something. He'll be back in a minute. Oh, okay. Make yourself at home. Sure. Hey. Hey. Good evening, ma. Oh, my dear. Come. ‎I'll be right back. Demi told me a lot about you. Really? Oh yes. He said you are such a nice young lady. And do you know what I told him? I said he should marry you immediately. Ma, we are just taking it slow but marriage is the ultimate goal. Erm, you can call me Mama. You are family now. Okay, Mama. Wow, such a pretty young lady. My Demi is very lucky. In fact, both my sons are very lucky to have beautiful ladies like both of you as wives. - Thank you, ma. - You're welcome. Thank you. Let me get the door. Oh. Okay. Oh! Very nice. She's acting like a wife already. - Hi. - Hi. Good evening. I'm here for Demi. And you are? Tayo. I'm Demi's date. Oh. I think you have the wrong house. My apologies. Isn't this Demilade's house? ‎This is right. Uh. Okay, um… So… I don't know what's going on, or whatever it is you have with Demi, but you're definitely not having dinner while I'm here. You must be Demi's sister. I understand. I understand that you're protective of him. The truth is… I like Demi. I really do. So do I. That's why we're getting married. Married? Yes. And if you will excuse me, I have a dinner table to set for my fiancé. ‎Fiancé? Bye. You know you shouldn't be here all alone. Someone could sweep you off your feet. What's the matter? Consider this an early wedding gift. I don't understand where this is all coming from. Save it, Demi. I already heard all about it from your fiancée. Fiancée? Just when I thought you were one of the few good ones. - Mummy, tell her. - Don't believe him. - If you taste my jollof… - He only cooks concoction. My firewood jollof... Dinner is cancelled. Ah, Demilade. What's the matter? Can't you behave yourself? Can't you see that we have guests in the house? Hey, sweetie. It's so good to see you, my love. I wasn't expecting you. Alright. Demilade, come on. Can't you get over the fact that she actually accepted your dinner invite? I didn't invite her. I'm even surprised that she showed up here in the first place. What do you mean? Um, babe… I actually invited her over. Wait. Demi, who…who did you invite exactly? Tayo. The girl in the club. The same one that ditched you? She didn't ditch me. It was a misunderstanding. Thanks again to Maria. Did you tell Tayo that we're getting married? Why? Do you realize how much damage you've caused? I only did you a favor. Have you seen that girl in broad daylight? She's, what, a three, I mean with good makeup on, she's like what, a four? What gives you the right to body shame her? Do you think you're perfect? Come on, isn't that obvious? Me? Ten over ten. I was just giving you free upgrade. You know what? It's fine. Would you get married to me or not? Please, leave. Wait. Are you seriously asking me to leave? Yes. Have a nice life, little Miss Perfect. Am I gonna get my money? Your what? Okay, hold on. Hold on a minute. Do you think I'll date this... - It's okay, Maria. - …thing for nothing? Maria, it's okay. I... No, It's not okay. I rendered you a service and now you have to pay for it. Do you know what time I wasted on this transaction? Do you know how many hook-ups I've lost because of this loser? See, just give me my money, please. I'm not cut out... Hey! Who do you think you are to talk to my son like that? Now, get out of my house. - Useless thief, cursed person, lazy girl! - Mummy! No. - Oh my goodness. - Are you still there? I can't believe what's going on right now. Demi, I… What was your plan? That I will be in a loveless marriage for the rest of my life? That wasn't the plan. The plan was that she'll file for an annulment a week after the wedding and you will not have to go through... I don't want to hear it! Hello. Both of you had better look for a way to fix this. Nonsense. Why? Why did you complicate everything? I didn't know that we were going to be able to find a way to get him married... Nah, come on! We could have waited. We could have been patient. We could have hoped for the best. The best? What's the best? I know you, Tunde. Would you have sat and waited for years… for your brother to find someone or even propose to her… Mr. I-Have-My-Life-All-Sorted-Out? Please. So you decided to throw him under the bus? All of this… what good has it caused? Take a look at it. The poor boy only wanted to help us, but now… - You betrayed him. You betrayed me! - I didn't be... This…all of this, I did it for you... Oh please. You're the one that has timelines, deadlines… - You're the one that I love. - Please. - Tunde, I love you. - Nah, please don't do that. Just… Tunde. I want to spend everyday I have on God's green earth with you. But we both know how you get when… things don't go your way. I did a bad thing… for the man that I love. And I'm sorry. Wait, you know what? Just… I can't believe this. I still can't believe this shit. Great, just like every other thing else in my life. How are you? Bro, I'm sorry I ruined your life plans. Bro, you need to relax. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's not like marriage was going reduce this unnecessary pressure I put on myself. I was so hell-bent on getting my life plan perfectly and I just forgot that sometimes I need to step back and be a brother, or be a son. Reminding myself of Mum. I want everything to go perfectly and if, God forbid, it doesn't go perfectly… problem. But see what Maria did to me! Wait, are you worried about Maria or are you worried about the other girl? Both. They both hurt me differently. Did you see the way Maria called me out? I saw. But have you tried to explain to this Tayo girl your own side of things? She doesn't believe me. She won't take my calls. Okay. She won't take your calls. Then let's go and see her in person so you can at least explain to her. I don't know where she stays. Bro, come on, don't tell me you are going to give up so easily, after everything we've put into this? Listen bro, I apologise for… ruining your marriage. Marriage. A marriage that is not happening anymore. For real? Well, I don't know, to be honest. And you are just saying this so casually. Aren't you hurting? I'm hurting but what am I going to do? Am I going to kill myself? See, with life sometimes, you just have to allow things play how they play and let the cards fall where they may. I can't kill myself. You need to fix your relationship. Even if I fix my relationship and we get back together, I still can't get married if you don't get married, so what's the point? Forget about that, bro. See, rules were meant to be broken. Who even invented all these rules like you can't piss in the swimming pool or eat tripe with your eyes open? No. That tripe one is gospel because see, if you are eating tripe and mistakenly, the thing just backfires and catapults into your eye… you are in trouble. Listen bro, you've always been there for me, man. Even in my darkest moments, you've always had my back. Stay away from my brother! See the Mario brothers are here to… Luigi, you want to fight me, right? Huh? You want to fight me. You want to save your brother, right? Get him, babe. Today, both of you will get beaten. Chill, let me have a look. Don't laugh. Okay that was crazy. I'm not doing that again. ‎No. I got you, man. I got you, bro. I got you. I didn't know they still do this Bournvita tech bootcamp They do. They reached out to me to teach kids about coding. Wow, the kids are lucky. It'll be nice to have them learn from the best coder. But see… just based off everything that you've told me about this girl, you have to go look for her. You think so? Yes. With everything that you've explained, she sounds like a perfect person to be a candidate for wifey. I think I know where to start. What is it? What is your problem? I said I can't. It's against company policy. No disclosure of personal information unless it's a potential match. Listen, I already told you I know this girl. I like her and she likes me. There's no potential here, it's a match. Look, Mister, don't destroy my life. What is a match? If she likes you that much, why don't you wait until she invites you to her house? It's complicated. Really? I knew it! I knew it! She doesn't want to speak with you. Give me her address, you heartless bastard! What?! What is it? Is there more to this than what we're discussing? Take. Let's just say this is you redeeming yourself after matchmaking me with that black bird from hell. Thank you. Noted. Thank you. Thank you very much. God bless you. But… Wait, let me… I want to ask a simple question. What is it with the Tayo girl? You're the second person requesting for her contact today. What? Who else asked? Some… Some lady. She seemed interested in her. Now that you have done… your worst and you've created an impact in my life, can you people leave now? What is wrong with you? - You want to get beat up? - You're mad. I'm the one you are using fists for? You want to get beat up? Look… If you try this thing with me… I have a song. A song? Bro, you can't sing to save your life. I know. But it's the thought that counts. Okay. Let me see what you have there. Bro, you didn't write this, come on. Didn't you just see me write it? Bro, that is a Maleek Berry song. I know. Wait… Damn. I didn't realize that until you told me. But… What do we do now? Let's get there first. Bro, she's not picking up her phone. - Uh… - Tayo. Maybe she's not at home, bro. No, she's at home. She works remotely. Okay, go and check. Let me park. You? You are the one I let have my Call Of Duty. Do you know my girlfriend, Tayo? She lives here. She's not happy with me and I'm trying to get in. Please help me get in. What's in it for me? I'll let you play my game when it comes out. You'll love it. Okay. Hi, Kelechi. I'm out. What are you doing here? I had to see you. Hi, Tayo. My name is Tunde and... Please, let's talk. Um, okay. Come in. - Sophia. - Tunde. - What are you doing here? - I… Listen, I'm so sorry. It's fine. I mean I figured that since I ruined things in the first place, it's only right that I come and fix things. Yeah, fix things. I'm very sorry, Tayo. I... Looks like I'll be hosting your entire family today. - It's not anyone we know, I promise. - It's okay. Good afternoon, ma. Good afternoon, my dear. How are you? I'm fine, ma. God bless you. You are welcome, ma. Mama, what are you doing here? I'm terribly sorry about the inconvience. You are here? It's fine. It's not like I… I get visitors often. I have come to help you. We're perfectly fine, Mama. If your heartthrob lives here, well… there is no harm in me to come visit and win her over, rather than watch you drown yourself in that sugary thing. Mama, I understand your concern but I can handle this myself. Tayo… I'm very sorry. What that crazy girl said was a lie. You don't have to apologize for anything. Demi… I feel bad. I shouldn't have reacted the way I did without hearing from you first. I honestly think that I should… let my guard down some more. Hopefully… this will make you drop down your guard. What are you doing? The right thing. Girl, you're just like fine wine. Girl, you're better with every single day and I'm loving the taste of this beautiful fine wine. Girl… you are a fine wine. You're the one for me. And you're gonna have my baby. - Is that not the line from Maleek Berry's… - I was just… Just shh. I was kinda hoping for a ring. Listen, Tayo… Let's take things slow, okay? I think we can really build something. - Together. - I think so too. Yes. I… I was stupid. Right? When you left the other day, I realised that I had been focusing on the wrong things. Deadlines and timelines, they don't mean anything. What really matters is the fact that I always want to be with you and I love you, Sophia. I love you, babe. I love you so much. It's so embarassing kissing in front of my mum. You people think that your father and I never made out. How did you come along? Mama, I don't want to think about that image in my mind. Anyway, Mama, this is the girl I told you about. - Tayo, meet my mum. - The nice girl. God bless you, my dear. Good girl, it shall be well with you. ‎-Congratulations. ‎-Thank you. Congratulations, bro. I know I didn't say this to you before but Sophia is a real catch. Yeah, congratulations to you too, bro. And she's happy and gorgeous too. You know what, yeah, I tell you, she's not the real person that is happy today. It's Mama. You can say that again. She got her wish. And it didn't matter that you said I do 30 seconds after I did. Bro, at least everything corresponded in the right order of things. Well hello, Demi and Tunde. - Hi, Raven. - Hi. Congratulations. I hope you guys are having a great time, a wedding under the blue sky… It's really a blessing, you know, filled with… - love and good essence, you know. - I heard you're with Larry now. Yes. Yes, we are. Actually, where is he? He's going to meet us at the after-party. Oh, okay. Raven, why are you acting like an angel? I am an angel. But wait, why do you keep calling me, Raven? My name is Sunshine. I think she has, like, a personality disorder or something. You know, someone was buried right there where you're sitting. You know what, let's just go party now. Bye, Raven… Sunshine. Whatever you are called. Hey! Pato! My lovely son. Congratulations. Come and greet me. She's not running away. She's not running away. ‎I'm really glad Larry introduced us. I've never met anyone as sleek as you before. You're are so sleek, it's unbelievable. That's because there are just two of us left in this realm. I know, right. So you're like, what, unique? Why don't we go somewhere private? How private? Extremely private. Okay. Hello Mama, is everything okay? Yes, we are all here. Okay, hold on. Go ahead, you are on speaker. I know you are all going away for your honeymoon tonight. But I have to tell you something important before you reach the moon. What is it, Mama? You know what usually happens when young married couples go away on their honeymoon? ‎Do you know? They make babies. Yes Tayo, they make grandbabies. When it comes to grandbabies, there is also an order of things. - Not again! - Demi and Tayo… Demi and Tayo got married first, so they should have the first baby. Understood? Yes, Mama. I don't know what to say to that. Man! Interesting taste. Tell me more about yourself. Like, what you already know? - My name is Maria, I'm twen... - No. Not your human form. I want to know more about your spirit form. What is your essence? Oh my essence? That's easy. Fashion. Do you believe in immortality? Like people not dying? Yes. Can't say I do. Why not? Because I know so many people that have died. Death is all about perception. And so is love and… immortality itself. Okay, I know people say I'm not perceptive… but why are we talking about this again? Never mind. You see… I want to open your eyes to a higher level of perception. How? Show me your hands. My hands? Let me take you to a whole new perception… of higher… ecstacy. ‎Subtitle translation by: Ayolope Koiki
