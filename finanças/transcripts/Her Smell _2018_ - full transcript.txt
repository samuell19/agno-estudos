Mama missed you, Mama missed you. Oh! Come on, come on. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Come on, come on. Yay! Whoa! There she is, the princess. - Danny brought her? - I don't know. - Dan's not here? - I haven't seen him. Did he not see the show? Is Ya-ema here? - There you are. - Yeah, here the fuck am I. Where's Danny? Where's Ya-ema? Uh, Danny's saying goodbye to people. - Is she with him? - She... She was... Ah, I want her away from my kid, okay? I want her away from my kid. Now, is he gonna come pick her up tonight or am I supposed to? What's happening, because I've gotta do that thing tomorrow so you've gotta come pick her up first thing in the AYEM, all right? Ya-ema! I mean, I don't know how you can show yourself. I assumed you worked it out with him. That's not true. That's not true. I hadn't worked it out. That's not true. Oh, Ya-ema. My darling. Becky needs friends. Yes! Ya-ema, onward. Come here, darling! Come here. What's his deal? She calls him Ya-ema but I think his real name's Alvin. I call him Sauron. There she is. Hi, honey. The orange one. We've purged the essence of invasive forces from this place. What is she doing here? Can't you see this is a fucking religious ceremony you have zero respect for? Good show tonight. Liar. You didn't see it. Don't call people liars, Becky, unless you know... Sorry, was anybody speaking to you, Little Miss Tiffany? Huh? Tiff-a-ny.Tiff-a-ny. I can't believe you're raising our daughter around a woman named Tiffany. - You're an angel. - It's true. It's true. - Could you excuse us? - Yes, excuse us, Tiff. What the fuck? - Where did you get these? - Ya-ema requested these items to envision the purity of people whose auras we must investigate, before mistress Becky allows them near the child. - Is this for real? - It's just important that she feels safe when Tama is with us, that's all. - So, you put a curse on me? - No, no, no. We haven't cursed you yet. We probably won't unless Ya-ema sees something in the smoke that he doesn't like. This is sick. You are sick! That's not helping. Can you just give us a minute? Goodbye, Tiffany! Don't be such a cunt, Beck. ♪ Ooh, C-U-N-T Everyone's accusing me ♪ We must resume our ritual. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. You were right. What can we do for you, Daniel? I wanted you to see her. It shouldn't be this difficult. I really want to see Tiffany. Yuck. - To see your child. - Ooh. Unless you'd rather walk out on her, too, in which case... - How can you let yourself be like this around her? - Hey, man. I'm working. And you said Tuesday, not Friday, which, how am I supposed to keep track if you're just gonna keep changing your mind? Well, I thought you'd want to see her before going to Europe. Europe. Oh. I forgot. You're not going to Europe. Did you know that? - Of course, I knew. - Well, you didn't act like I was wrong when I said it. I was testing you. There is no European tour. I would know if there was. - Oh, you would? - Yeah. Because I would have packed a bag, which as you can see, clearly I have not. Whoa. - What's that? - You're a mess. - You're a mess. No, you're a mess. - You're a mess. No, you're a mess. No, you're a mess. ♪ Oh Danny boy, the pipes, The pipes are calling ♪ From glen to glen ♪ - Hi, baby. - Hi, Mari. Mm. ♪ From glen to glen You seem well. ♪ And down the mountain side ♪ Are we ready to rock? Laurie, baby, we just finished rocking. Rocking and-a-rolling. Only problem is I did not get to visit the other place with Ya-ema. Because old Danno came in, interrupted my spiritual journey. It was postponed. So, we still got that to tend to. As you know, I am not myself if I do not visit my other realities. Where the fuck is my lighter? Why... Why do you let her do this? I'm not a fuckin' babysitter, mate. Y! B-E-C-K-Y! Looks like I got it. Hey, man, don't discriminate. Here's to whatever gets people spiritual balance... That's like fucked up! Hello! Exactly. You know you'll hate yourself forever if you miss these years with her. - Ooh. - Heavy shit, Dirtbag Danny. - Nobody calls me that anymore. - This is the night show - with DJ Dirtbag Danny, - Ah. playing all the dirty, nasty rock you can only hear after dark. Becky? - Becky? - Becky? - Becky? - Becky? - Becky? - Becky? Becky! Becky! Becky! Hmm. Hey. You seen Tiffany? You shouldn't come around here and see her like this. What choice do I have? I'm the loser who always crawls back. Twice, she fired me from this tour and forgot about it the next morning. We all crawl back. How much is she paying the shaman? I'm not sure. But in all likelihood, that answer would upset you and me both. How's business? Euro tour's canceled but I guess you already knew that. - Yeah. - They're opening the vaults for an AP or something. Oh, if she's gonna fuck this up for all of us it doesn't end well. - Yeah. - Yeah. Yeah. And don't be so negative. What's about? You need cash? Tama needs more than I can give. Becky has to take responsibility, right? - May I? - Sure. Howard might cancel the dates we're holding for the new record. - He knows we're not ready. - What does that mean? It means that I hope you have a plan B to put this one in private school. Is she in breach? Should I talk to someone? No. Our lawyer's got it sorted out. No one's really expecting much for her at this point though. She handed me my walking papers, seven months later she hands me Tama. Ever since then my life's been a nightmare, in some ways. Wow. That's heavy-duty. It's my fault. I thought you two would be a match made in heaven. I want her out now. I want her out. - Fuck off! She has to go... - You can't be serious. Now! We saw it in the smoke. The child will be my downfall. Ya-ema... - I did not decree this. - You did, you did, you did. You saw a prophecy when we were in the other place. You said the child would be my downfall. We have a lit stick of dynamite that needs tossing out the tank! Becky, this is your child we're talking about. Mistress Becky! Mistress Becky! Look at my king. What do you see? Tell us. I see the void of eternity. - Hey. Hey! - Howard! Howard. - They loved you. - How are you? - And I love that they loved you. - It was a good show, huh? Great. - Danny, what's happening? - Holding it together. - You wouldn't understand. - Oh. Uh, Becky, Zelda is waiting. Ah, fuck. I forgot. What does that bitch want? - Easy, love. - Express regards to your celebratory remarks. - Whatever. - She said you were great tonight. What, did she just come here with fucking obvious stuff that I already know or what? Of course, I was great. I am always good. I believe I saw her with an olive branch. Would I lead you astray? - No, Howard... - Do it for me. Come on. She's not lying. You were great tonight. She brings negativity. You see? You see? What is Zelda Ezekiel coming and doing here anyways, coming backstage at our show when I'm trying to spend quality time with my family, - and just demand an audience? - Chill out, Beck. Zelda's all right. Yeah. Okay. Where is she, Howard? - Um... - While we're on the topic, can you please tell me, are we doing those recordings of our tracks like last time? Ali says you're doing an EP instead of a whole record. Yeah, she, like, found some pretty powerful stuff in the '92 sessions. Of course. Anything you need. - Can't get a fucking straight answer out of them, you know? - Anything you need. That's because you understand me, don't you? You really know I can't count on anybody crazy. What kind of world is this when we can't even get straight information... - Let's just say hello to Zelda. - ...I'm recording an album. - Okay? - Why do you insult me? - Well, I will sort it all out - ...Or an E-fucking-P... - while you're meeting with her, okay? - ...guitar or something? Just, dear, please, Howard. Please just get me an answer and please make it an honest one. She is very excited to see everybody. - Everybody. - Everybody. - Everybody? Wait, we're all going? - Yes. Ooh! Why didn't you say so? I don't wanna do it alone. Come to me, my ex... On the right, and to the left. On the right, and to the left. To the right, and to the left. To the right, and to the left. Oh, man, I wish I had your patience. I'm a communicator. I communicate. Anything I can do? Help her. That'll help me. I'm trying. Always trying. ♪ Hand bone, hand bone's connected to the ♪ Butt bone, Butt bone's connected to the... ♪ And that's the word Of the Lord ♪ And that's the turn Of the Lord ♪ - Great show. - Oh, that's easy for you to say from the comfort of that chair, isn't it? This is my love, L-L-Lauren. Oh, what a beauty. Come on. Marie's told me all about you. Ah! I can just go if y'all want some alone time. Calm down, girl. What do we owe the pleasure of your visitation? 'Cause you're killers. I want to see the new shit for myself. Well, what do you think? I'm green with envy. So, Howard said that you guys are almost up in this one. Yeah, I don't know if I'm really feeling the stage life, know what I mean? Why, what did he ask? I've got a string of dates coming up. I was wondering if maybe you guys would be, uh, interested in joining me. Oh, I don't know. What do you mean? Like, opening act for you? That doesn't really make any sense, don't you think? What is it, like, six years ago? Oh, wait, if it was six years ago, you'd be opening for M-E, me. And you would be trying to run off with this one. Hey, when are the... when are the dates? What are the dates? How about a simple "No, thanks"? And thank you, by the way, for coming to personally bitch slap us in all of our faces. We do rock music for rock people. And didn't I hear that on your last record, you didn't even have any guitars? I will never - share a stage with you. - Fucking be careful with that shit! It's fine. March-ish. Hey, don't fucking talk to her. Don't even look at her. Here's an idea. How about you march-ish right out of this room into your limousine and take that fucking offer with you? We need a break, not a tour. We just finished this one like, what, an hour ago. Who's interested in another tour? You brought me on my first tour, Beck. I'll never forget it. Look, I'm not your enemy. I never was. Despite what you think happened at the festival thing. You're gonna make me beg to get you to bury the hatchet. Listen to me. Your music used to be awesome. And now it sucks. So, I don't wanna tour with you. And now you come to bury me? I mean, I think I can speak for all of us when I say that we have zero interest in retreading the past, which includes your fabled support. As I am trying to move forward here, not backwards, which means I don't wanna slip down your fucking bill. I mean, don't you have, like, the next generation of pansy, art rock babes who are just dying to share your light? Why don't you ask one of them? Because my answer is no. And where I go, they go. - I should go. - Babe, don't go. Stay, please. I feel like we're not... You're one of a kind, I'll give you that. That's right, it's an original, stick to your guns and your roots... ♪ P-U-R-E spells Becky ♪ - You are fucking lovely. - So, do we have a deal? Howard, how could you? - You set me up. I trusted you. - Now, I thought you might feel this way but just hear us out. Okay? It's not what you're thinking. It's not gonna be clubs. It's theaters. - Theaters. - It's an intimate tour. It's fuckin' boring. It's really boring. Pass. - Well, I'm sorry you feel bad. - God, if you're not gonna leave, I will. I have an interrupted journey to complete. And, by the way, you are all being incredibly rude to Ya-ema in the spiritual calm that he requires. I am not done with you. You are in big trouble. - Becky? - Having fun in Becky-town? Whatever could you mean? Say it. - It'll be fine. It'll be fine. - Just say it. It's nothing. Hey. Who is Ya-ema? Uh, Sauron, the all-seeing guru. I'll go. Yeah, I think that might be for the best. I'm so sorry. It was worth a shot though. Maybe we should... take another swing when she's not so... so... I can't find the word. Door's open. I'm all ears. You know, you used to pack places twice this size. What happened? Canceling tours, twice, at the last minute has, oh, untested side-effects. It'll be fine. If you change your mind... Cold smothered crap, you're still here? Jesus Christ, take a hint. Zelda has left the building! The Legend of Zelda is stink to the air, has come to an E-N-D, if you please. I'm leaving. Don't overreact. I hardly think I'm overreacting. I'm just normal reacting. I'm sorry to be so fucking... Hey, this was entirely my idea. Don't blame her. - Just let me take her. Let me take her. - No, stop it. No, you shouldn't be holding her in this state. What, is that the state of rage, or the state of New York? 'Cause I don't know where I am. - Let me take her. - ...fucking clown... Wee! Oh! That was a fun ride. Wanna go on another sky ride? - Huh? With Mommy? - Fucking mess! Perhaps we should all retreat to our separate rooms for a bit? Aren't you enjoying the show? Huh, you got nothing to see now? - Come on, it's fine. - It's all right. - Her job at the mall... - No. Not right now, not with us. - Am I running my mouth? Am I saying things I might regret? - No, stop. Don't. Enough! Why don't you... if you run you can catch up with Zelda, huh? She's boring and easy and fun. And isn't that what you want? - Beck, don't. - Yeah. Don't what? Chill. BECKY: And what, show everyone a G-O-O-D time? Huh? Come here, baby. Tough job, but somebody's gotta do it, you know? I gotta get out of here. I've got to go to Becky's room. This stinks of Zelda's shit. Bitch, you would do... Hibbidah hibbidah hibbidah. That's all fuckin' bullshit. Wee! - You all right? - I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm fine. Becky, you're okay, sweetie. Beck, come on. Come on, Beck. Come on, Beck. Daddy, daddy! - Her head. - What's wrong? Good girl. Good girl, come on. Not right now. We go way beyond. We go way beyond. I can't believe you're doing this to my child. What are we supposed to do with it, though? I don't really know. Well, just hang it. What do you mean, "What are we supposed..." Here you go. Yeah! I mean, we are the first and only girl band to ever sell this many records. I'd like to say... Oh, shit! We're never gonna make a record this good again. Ki-bash! Oh! Howard! We need a new one. We have another one. - I'm not touching that. - Wait, wait, wait... We're sorry, sorry. Wait, get the record!

That's a fucking bummer, right? I told you you shouldn't come back. I had to see for myself who was occupying the studio that I had stopped paying for. Or did they not give you the memo? Well, Becky decided to pay for it and must have old you about it, out of respect. I guess. Isn't that nice of her. I have this room booked for my new group, but it's not yet vacated. That's why you came back. Did they not tell you you needed to leave? Yeah. They did. And what did she say? I... I'd rather not repeat it. Well, if this is the best she's got to show after nine months, I'm, I'm... I'm very screwed. We know you're out on a limb for her on this, big time. Laid off workers to cover overages, mortgage on my beach house. I'm not out on a limb. I'm lying on the ground next to the damn tree. I didn't know that. I'm sorry. Releasing their new album this year would help cover your mess, if I could... What is this, Talk and Tea time? Are we doing a session or is this a goddamn book club? Jesus Christ! Am I the only one... This is the first day in two weeks she's been here for longer than an hour. Also, she came in at 2:00. - Well... - AM. We've been here. She's in the self-proclaimed groove. Show of hands. Who is committed to greatness and will do whatever it takes to achieve it? And a show of hands, who is lazy and doesn't care about the music that we are recording here? That's one for greatness. Anyone else? Thank you, Keith. It's nice to know someone is on my side, the winning side. And we all know who writes history. You all can just go home and take a nap or something 'cause your level of dedication has been exposed. Right, Howard? Did you come to check up on your prized project? Thank you for giving us some space lately, but I gotta tell you, I'm sorry, but it is going terribly. - At best. - Well, there is a solution to this. I just need to figure out what it is. If we could all just take a step back, and think - for a second. - That is a grand idea. Why can't you two be more like team players, - like Howard? - Just give it a rest, lady. The show's exhausting. And I've seen it too many times to stick for the finale. Sorry, what? What did you say? - She said that... - No, I heard her. I just wanted to make sure I heard her correctly. Ali darling, care to take it one more time from the top with feeling, s'il vous plait? Look at yourself. Easy, now. Would Becky Something wither and die if she interacted on an adult level? Okay. Let's just be calm, all right? We can withdraw to some neutral place, - and discuss a compromise, so that we can... - Boring, Howard. - No, I'm fucking tired. - We can work this out. Ali? Maybe she could make some sort of grand final statement. What? Why? Why would I explain myself to you, when you're only gonna remember your version? I'm fucking done! She's still talking. She's leaving. That is hers though. And, oh, I took care of this band while you took care of yourself. I didn't want to be thanked. I didn't want the gloss. That was your thing. You just plucked me into it. So, enjoy it. Have fun. Ali, come on. Don't... Well, that is just as Ya-ema prophesied, and what a fitting moment. Just when I was seriously doubting your commitment. It's been a rotten year bringing this mongoloid to term. But I knew it. I knew it. I knew today was gonna be the final straw. I knew it when I walked in the D-O-O-R. There was a fetid stink in the elevator, you know? Big whoop, right? Watch this, watch this. Watch how quickly we're gonna bounce back. All right? You watch this. - You watching? - I'm watching. Watch. Are you watching? I'm watching. I'm looking. Look, I'm Ali! Watch! I'm Ali now! - Excuse me. - Wait, Mari. You can't just... Mari. Mari, don't just... Fucked up! You fuckin... Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Hee-hee-hee... Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Marielle, help. Fuck, what a fuckin' honor. No, Mari's fine. Um, we're booked. I mean, we were booked. - I don't... Howard said... - Yeah, yeah, I heard. I mean, it's just a... It's just a whole nightmare right now. Are you kidding? We only want this place 'cause you guys record here. Yeah. Shameful to say, it's like an honor to be bumped by Something She, like, the top. - Sorry, I'm a little nervous. - No, no, that's all right. I mean, it's just a terrible time to join a woman in. She's all gone, like the worst she's ever gone. - Keith, where's Howard? - He's in the back office. You might wanna check on him. He doesn't look good, and I think he's dry-heaving. See, exactly. I mean, not to get too deep, but... She's, like, falling apart big time now, so, maybe actually...

I mean, the behavior in here's been, shall I say, erratic lately. Erratic on a good day. - On a bad day? - They're all bad days nowadays. Well, it seems like we have a logjam. We're all family here. Business family. One big, happy business family. - Um, yeah, you know, if there's like a problem... - Nonsense. No problem at all. Everything's fine. Everything's fine. We'll record your album. We'll release it. Everything will work out easy as pie. Becky... Becky'll understand. Uh, I also think she knows we're here now. Oh, yeah. Here she comes. Who the fuck are these bitches? The Aker girls. Did I not send you their seven inch... You're gonna love them. You're gonna love them. They're... Yeah, I've signed them. And... We're not interrupting, so, like, no disrespect Ms. Something. We're huge fans. And as thrilling as it is to see your... Your passion and commitment, I was counting on the studio being free by now. I... perhaps, it's my mistake. - Because I haven't exactly been around. - You cut us off. They tried to evict me. - Why would you do that to us, Howard? - It's a misunderstanding. I was giving you space and freedom without my breathing down your neck. You know? And I did what I had to do to tighten my belt but can you blame me? - Did you know about this? - Nope. We just showed. She had no idea. Howard, you fucking genius. What are the odds? What are the odds that we would find ourselves one apple short of a bushel, and you would unknowingly bring me a solution to all of the world's problems? Who plays the drums? Are the rest of you ready to jam? Because if I had to guess, I would say that we are 15, maybe 20 minutes away from pure magic exploding into this room. And silly me, I lost a drummer on the way to grandmother's house. Here I thought we'd have to scrap paper and go home. And what should happen instead, three witches come to my rescue.

Cut the shit. Come on, you're making me feel like I'm a hundred years old. But goddamn, I just really feel a connection to you babes, you know? You feel that, Mari? Yeah, Beck, I feel it. I've been out here feeling it. It feels like I were waiting for you to fucking feel it. And that's what I'm talking about. Howard, my goodman. I'm ready to party. Let's make an album because I have been sent some angels to work the angles, you dig? And what better way to introduce new... ...blood into this turgid process, than actual new blood? Let's bathery these bitches. Learn a thing or two about what the kids are feeling nowadays, huh? Inward, ho. Keith, can you give us a minute? What the hell are you doing? Well, it looks like I'm saving your asshole and keeping this record on schedule. Don't you worry about reimbursing me for the studio, it's my treat. I can't afford another eight months, I will go bankrupt while you finish your opus. I'm on my last credit line, and you're on life no. 9, and these girls might be our salvation. So, it would be swell if you didn't torpedo them in the process of drowning. Howard, you confuse torpedoing, which I don't know anything about, with making an album, which you'll, if you'll excise me, I'm quite eager to resume before my juices dry up again. Can you make her aware? Ugh. What, do I need a translator? I got it, loud and clear. It's ear on the rear of a deer. Look, we don't need to do this. We just fucking met 'em. We can take... ...a day to regroup and we can just call Ali. Who? Who? I don't know anybody by that name. It's actually kind of a funny name. If you think about it. Except if you're a Muslim. Mari. My love. You have my attention. And I, yours. Is there something that you wanted to say, or was that just a challenge to a duel? We don't get another chance... ...if we fuck this up.

But I'm talking about, like, a ground-up collaboration. - Yeah. - I wish I could give it to you now but, I just, I know myself too well, and it's you know, highway or her way. We're gonna jam, you know, back you up. - Anything. - It's what I need, followers. Silent peons to worship at my feet. Ladies, ladies, what harmony you have found within one another. What spirit shared and just divided three ways. God, it is the rarest of things that should not be taken lightly. Capture it, my sisters, hold on to it, and then never, never release that bond you share. Wise advice from a true original. Are you fucking kidding me? You know, I hope you girlies don't buy this bullshit. I mean, you seem smart. Smarter than me. Dumb old merry grade-A sucker. Bought it, hook, line, and sinker. Fool me once, shame, shame, shame. Sorry, what? I mean, who better than the great Becky Something to dispel wisdom on the value of others, who does more to express appreciation and dedication to those you fucking support. I support. This is not a two-a-day two-way street, darling. No, it's a dead end, darling. It is a dead end. Mari, Mari, better be careful, or you're gonna offend our guests. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. We can just leave, you know? We don't wanna be flies on the wall while you sort this stuff out. See? Now look what you've fucking done. Alienating the acolytes. Vanquish the venerating. Exile the exuberant. This is a blessed thing. It's the next. Hold them close we should, not exile them. This is in poor taste. Yeah. It always is. And then it's not. Run away. Flee! Flee! Big Bad Bossy Becky Makes Maudlin Mari Mope. Get the bullshit out of here. It belongs... it belongs on fucking Mars. Enjoy it because... 'Cause it could be fun. Enjoy it. Well, that's the first logical thing I've heard all day. All I ever ask is for a little respect, you know? If you can't get that in the workplace, then where can you get it? You dig, right? Mush. You will mush. - Mush! Mush, mush. - Okay. Onward, into the future. Beep-beep! Okay. You know what, I think we should just come back. This doesn't seem like the right time... Night time is the right time. Bed ways is the right way, so tally-ho. Not that we're not organized product. We are, of course. Let the wild rumpus begin. ♪ Garbage dump Oh, garbage dump ♪ Why are you called the garbage dump ♪ You could feed the world with my garbage dump ♪ You could feed the world with my garbage dump ♪ Mari just left. We don't need to be here right now. We can give you your space. This must not be super easy. Wrong. I am the heart and soul of this band. Hello, I named it after myself. I found those girlies, and they were not the first, and they will not be the last. I put Something She together from the ashes of failed junk bands, wanting to have something in my own name, like God spewing mankind. That's ancient history, and so are those ungrateful wenches who suckled at the teat of success that I placed upon their mouth. Before we embark upon this journey, promise me one thing. Show me honesty, and I will do the same, because that is the pillar of my music. So, enough with this jibber-jabber and let's rock! And that sums it up in one big lump. What should we do? Well, for starters, go into that booth, and wake those turds up, and tell them it's blast off to the fucking stars. We gonna hit the fucking switch because the circus is leaving town and it ain't coming back. We'll go get the rest of our gear? Oh, yeah! You know, you can't be fully acquainted with Becky Something until you want her to fuck off. Remember that. ♪ You'd rather die ♪ Than apologize ♪ But fuck it I didn't need To see this through ♪ I'm back Back to the same shit ♪ I was drowning in then ♪ If I'm gonna be pulled down ♪ Then I'm taking you with ♪ I'm back Back to the same shit ♪ I was drowning in then ♪ If I'm gonna be pulled down ♪ Then I'm taking you with ♪ We need to lose their minds. - Oh, my God... - Girls, I am so proud of you. My mom would never ever, ever come to something like this. Oh, I never missed a show, a concert, a school play. Becky, tell them. It's basically, you're our mum, too, aren't you? Yes! - Oh, she's so nervous. - I'm not nervous. - She's so nervous. - Mom, shut up. I'm not nervous. - I'm just trying to practice. - I'm really happy you're here. - I'm... - Thank you, Mom! This is so much fun. Oh, God, you're so amazing. I'm so proud... Hey, you seen Becky? She checked in yet? Nah, man. Hey. How's my grandbaby? She's at home with Tiffany. She's miserable. - Her mom's a deadbeat who never calls. - Poor Daniel. Drawn into family saga. I'm her new family. Life goes on. Hopefully it does. She's not here. Everybody's looking. What happened to my baby Rebecca? Did I do something that wrong? Daniel, everything we've been put through, and for what? - For love? - Ah, yes. For love. - She in here? - No. We're 40 minutes behind. Venue's lights out at midnight. Don't set your watch to Becky-time. What are we doing here? She won't perform. Yeah, she has to. She has to? Why? Well, we got a bad feeling this is it for Becky. She's opening in a small venue with proteges. She's sold out arenas. Why do you fall for it? She cut the head off our life together swiftly, and with no mercy, and apparently I'll never come to terms with that. She's way behind what we agreed on for Tama. I've been trying to get her and these in the same room for three months. Her lawyer quit. He called me. Yeah, her plan is to ignore anybody suing her until they give up or die. Yep. I should have knocked. - Alexandra. - You fell for it! She'll be here. She will be here. Ooh, where do you find the faith? It's a curse. If you have anything to have, it'll never be weighed. I cannot believe I got talked into this. - She needs you. - Yeah, no, every bully needs a weak punching bag to swing back for one more smack. No one cares about the players, right? They're just here for Becky. I mean, what am I gonna do, quit? Be a nobody? I don't even belong in this world. I used to play church basements and I was happy there. Never even played venues this big. Really big. A block from the underground. Footnote in the defining oral history of the era. Fuck. We all rely on her for something. We rely on Ms. Something for something. Fame. Work. Glory. Money. Love. Support. Opportunity. Our golden goose sprays golden piss in our faces. She supported me for many years. Yeah, me too. What a wretched feeling. As you know. And such is the end of the saga of Something She. Ignominious. Fitting. So, let's go. I'm gonna go talk to security. She ain't here. Fuck. Fuck, I fucking knew it. - No, I think she's gonna show. - Don't fucking touch me. That's the spirit. Dirtbag Danny, it's really you! It's just... just Danny. Dude, I taped your show religiously, - like, every night, bro. Yeah. - Oh, yeah? I don't even have the early tapes. You got some special stuff there. Yeah, this is really fucking great, but this is kind of, like, a big fucking deal for us, so. And don't mind me trivializing your professional dilemma. I just... I've been in your shoes more times than I can count. Can you give us a success ratio? Anything? I mean, like, this is not okay. This isn't okay. There's a plan, right? You make the plan, you stick to it. It's written in ink. Hey, she will be here. Might be any second. Might be in two hours. But, no, it's... it's really cool and all what you're doing for Becky and me, I guess. But Beck's not used to not headlining. So she forgets that nobody waits for the opener. All right. So what do we do? You got any vocal warmups, or... I don't... I don't know what your pre-show is. You wanna jam? Or just, like make out? This is beyond me, okay? Just find me when the nightmare's over. I'm done. Oh, boy. She needs this. She's going through a lot. We all are. Shit's like wobbly with us, you know? Heartbreak. Wiser folks have tried and failed. But, pay, guys. I signed the contracts for today. So, if she doesn't show, you can sue her, too. And I think that'll make a baker's dozen. Oh. Hi. Sorry. Um. Roxy. - Hi. - That was Dottie, and this is Crassie. - Hi. Hey. - Nice to meet you. Thanks for giving her this chance. I know she doesn't make it easy. She'd do it for us. Already did, actually. So. Oh, yeah? How'd you repay her? By fucking it up? She'll be here. It's a pattern. Thank you so much. Disappear, make you miserable, keep you waiting, then come back when you're out of options. My mom wouldn't step foot in a place like this, so. Well, I'm not just here to watch Becky inflict pain on others. We have enough of that to last lifetimes. - Nothing? - Nada. This is great! Well, that's it. I'm done. It's over. She has cost me a house, half my company. Can anyone here accuse me of not trying hard enough? Have I not provided opportunity after opportunity, and this is how it ends? Ah, forgive me. Ania. - You know it, and I know it. - Lovely to see you. Thanks. At this point, does it even matter if we wait any longer? We were supposed to go on five minutes ago. We're going on hour two of a sold-out crowd waiting - for something to happen. - I am deeply sorry. How could I know? Start the show! All right, we'll give her ten more minutes. No, make that five. Then, it's over. I am sorry. I am so sorry. You know no one wants this night to come off more than I do, but... Hey, you want to flip for it? I don't suppose there's any benefit in an Ali van der Wolff acoustic solo set. At this point, anyone on stage but Becky is only gonna make matters worse. Oh, I figured as much. So, what now? Wait. She's here. I always tried to do what was best for my baby girl. Music lessons, drives to concerts. Start the fucking show! Start the fucking show! Get on the fucking stage! Becky? Becky! Ding dong, and the bitch is back! Show of hands, who missed me? - Two hours. - Two minutes till midnight! Hey, you're actually suing me, right? Or is that somebody else? - I'm suing you. - I'll see you in court. Judge! Your Honor! Is it a crime in this country to prefer the witching hour? I was born with an internal clock. The doctor left it inside me. I call to the stand my mother, Mrs. Ania Adamcyzk. Nee Smolenska... "Mrs. Adamcyzk, "do you swear solemnly that your daughter was born "with a rare neurological condition "that renders the passage of time and enforced illusion "from the external world?" "Judge, please. I just can't seem to get going until later at night. "Do you think I wanna be late? "Those people deserve a show! "And you have no idea the hell that I've been through. "I am wishing there was any way on earth I could get going "but I just don't think I'm gonna make it." Promise me, Mama, when I die, have the coffin arrive half an hour late, and on the side, written in gold the letters of the words, "Sorry for the delay." Rebecca. My sweet Rebecca. Mom, stop it. You're embarrassing me in front of my friends. I told you to wait in the car. They're making a movie about me, and I want them to see, like, the real me, so ixnay on the ebecca-ray, okay? How can you inflict such pain? Can you fucking stop it with the dramatics, Mom? I haven't seen you in months, you want to play this now? Don't be ungrateful. Tell me I was always there. You're right. You deserve a pass. 'Cause you were in the fucking trenches, lady. You really were, you know? And you were alone, weren't you? Weren't you? You remember how alone you were? You remember? You remember how you were always, always alone? Your father wanted you to have this. Where was he 15 years ago, when I was nobody but his daughter? Great! Throw it in the trash. - How is married life, Dirtbag? - Get out of my face. - We should go. - Hey, hey, hey, stay, babes. Your loyalty will be rewarded. That's how it works. Isn't that right, Ali? It's funny. I didn't know you saw me here. Kid, your energy is so fucking foul, I could see you in the dark. - Don't be mad. - No, I'm not mad. - Come on, I'm ready. - Yeah, you ready to rock? I was born ready. Doesn't everyone know that by now? What, do you think I need to warm up like some mere mortal? I don't think so, Tim. I wouldn't step foot in this joint if I wasn't ready for v-v-victory! Children, come here. Come here. Join me in the sacred circle for a spiritual cleanse. Where's the third member of your coven? Dottie OZ, you get your butt in here this instant, or you are grounded! How am I doing, Mom, huh? Mother of the year, right? Finally. Hah, come here, come here. Finally. Join the circle of energy, come on. Come on. Anybody who does not want to be here, look away. Or you can leave. Not you. Come here, come in. Get in there, yeah. Good. Dear goddess of creativity and positivity, Becky here. How's it going? I am speaking to you tonight, not only on behalf of myself but on behalf of my little sisters, Dottie OZ, Crassie Cassie and Roxy Rotten. It's a big night for them, so let's take care of our Aker girls. They're swell kids. They deserve the best. As for me, I need this. I need this bad. 'Cause this is it for old Beckster. Last train is leaving the station, and if I'm not on it when the whistle blows, that's it for me. Lights out, last call, soup's cold, ice cream's melting. Beer's warm. Yuck. Let's rally... One more time. And you can take that soul I promised you. Did you get it? Perfect. Start with that, it'll be fucking phenomenal. Now let's burn this fucker down for the big finish! All right. Let me... - Let me go tell them you're ready. - Fuck yeah! Another poor decision. I'm leaving. I'll join you in a moment. Make sure that she gets these. Yeah. You're not gonna... you're not gonna watch the show? No. I don't wanna see what happens next. But I have one thing that I need to say to my daughter. - We'll talk tomorrow. - Yeah. Let's make it sooner. - I love you. - I love you, too. Well, have a great show. Is she gonna be okay? No, she's not. I don't know. Um... Guys, I know that you don't need a fucking... Uh, listen to an old has-been like me, but you're gonna kill it tonight, and after tonight, just... Please love each other. - Go, go, go. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. Yeah. So, is there something we should do? What else can we do? We shouldn't have asked her to play tonight. She's not straight. No. I'm sorry, we gave her a chance. Kill your idols. Give 'em enough rope and they'll do it themselves. Right. I never even wanted any of it. I just wanna rock with you. Where's my camera? The fuck is that still doing here? He has things he wants to say to you. I see no harm in that. Do you understand forgiveness? Can you understand regret? You weak, stupid wimp. After everything he has put us through. He used to look up to you. He thought you were better than this. Deep down I knew you weren't. You're more like your father than you'll ever know. Come on, let's go. Give it to me. Destroy it. Beck, stop! Becky, no. - Ow! - Wipe this from the people. Let in the light and forsake the darkness! - Do it. - Do you speak not to me. To hear your words is to open myself to your trickery. I have fought you in 11 other lives, in 11 other lives, you have destroyed me. Stop! You're hurting me. Fuck, fuck! I have lived across time and I see how to defeat those who will see me destroyed. For the first time, I have the power to do what must be done, and for the last time we struggle! Somebody, help. Help me please. We're just in a... Be cool, all right. Be cool. No, no, no. - Raise your glass. - Fuck! Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Just take it easy. Let's keep her okay, all right? - Hello! - Howard! Please, stop her. Gentle with her! Just step back now. All right, okay. Okay. Drop it. She dropped it. She dropped it. Can you not hurt her please? Are handcuffs necessary? Look at her. Now, when do I get my lousy phone call? Just leave her... Fucking don't... She's... Take a step back! - Hey! - It's fucking over! Stop! I said stop filming! Get out! Steven, can you stop them from filming? Get out of here! Stop! Becky? Where are you... Ali? Becky? Beck... Don't go out. Becky! Becky! Becky! Do you ever get the feeling you're being followed? Fuck yeah! - I've been back through the ages of earth - Back it up! and I've witnessed centuries of conflicts. I've regressed to the moment of my conception, - and I've watched myself being born! - What the fuck? You know what? That's why I'm leaving, because when I needed it, nobody ever put a hand on my back and told me it was gonna be all right! Dude! It's the little things! The little things. Hold on, Becky. Oh shit! Come on, Becky. Sometimes I don't even know myself. Mom? Mom? Mom? I wanna stay home with my baby. No tour, no record. I like it here. See. You ready for me to take her home now? All right, take her. Take her, I'm too tired. I got you. Fuckin' tired. - Baby. - Mommy. Momma missed you. I missed Momma. Hey, kiddo, Mommy and Daddy need to talk. Maybe you want to play pinball? Yeah, okay. You look good. Bullshitter. I'll have a year next week. I know. That's really great. She's been asking about you all the time. She misses me? She doesn't really know you. She has no memory of living with you. I had this dream. We were brothers in a past life. And we were Native American. And you killed all the children in our tribe. And that's why I was so horrible to you in this life. Oh... Before I forget... You need to look at those. - I will. - Today. I'm taking 'em back with me, so. Does it make a difference? Yes. Yeah, it does. Including you, do you know how many lawsuits I have against me? Yes, I do. Would you care to say it out loud? Would it make a difference? Settling with M and A. Child support. Breach of contract. Contracts. Promoters. Howard. - I've lost track. - Yeah, well, don't lump us in with all of that. There's nothing left. They gave me my band name in exchange for publishing. I don't own my own music. I'm broke. I can't give you anything. I don't want you to sell the house. I just need to know that... Half of whatever dollars you find go to Tama. I can't leave this house. I can't go back into the world. Mari's here. - Excuse me, what? - She drove up with me. She's in the car. You shouldn't have done that. That's okay. She just wants to talk. She took everything I built. She didn't take it. You lost it. And besides, you built it together. Well, I can't see her like this. She's sober, too. She's been through it. She understands. Yeah. I just need a minute. Go get her, and count to 100. Momma, I lost my free balls. Come here. You're getting big, kiddo. What's Daddy feeding you? Chicken fingers and fish fingers. Wow. I wish I had some of those. And noodles. I don't know if we have any of that, but if you're not too big, you know, I could maybe get you some peanut butter and jelly. Peanut butter? All right, all right. Play me a song, Mommy. What kinda song? A song that reminds you of me. A song that makes me think of you. Hmm... Okay. - You ready? - I'm ready-o.

I had a vision of you holding her at my funeral. I saw you and Danny holding her hands. And I was so happy that you were her godmother. I mean, I've seen my death a dozen times in a dozen different ways. In every vision, I'm surrounded by people. I never die alone. Well, you're alone now. Beck, you should leave this place. There's an ache in my bones. Oh, presents from Howard. Thanks, Howard. How's he doing? Yeah, well, actually, the Aker girls are big.

I was always the bigger person. Ali didn't. You didn't try to stab me. Except in the back. Yes, you did. How's she been? Good. She's put out an album with her husband and... it's pretty great. - Husband? - Yeah, Roy. Yeah, they're really amazing together. I should get a copy. - Well, I can just... Mine's in the car, so I can... - I'll buy my own. All right. Okay. I don't think she's mad at you anymore. I don't think I'm mad at you anymore either. You were... You were horrible.

She's like so big. I'm so happy for you. You're gonna be a really good mom. - You think? - Yeah. Thank you. You... still jamming then? Just alone, you know. A lot. Well, do you wanna? Sure. Don't tell anybody about what you hear, okay? No, I won't. Just like if anybody asks you. Does anybody ask? Not as much as they used to. - Okay. - Yeah. Only... Be kind, all right?

There's nothing here that can hurt me so I can't leave the house. - Or else... - Or else what? Somehow I cheated it. It's very real. It wasn't that time, so maybe it'll be next time. - So there just can't ever be a next time. - Nah, that's insane. No, it isn't. Ya-ema once told me that Tama would be my downfall and I always thought he meant that she would bring my downfall. And it wasn't until later that I realized that he meant my love for her is my true weakness. No, I don't buy any of that. You know, you shouldn't still talk about him. He's a fraud and he took advantage of you and lots of others, and is in jail for it now. He understood me. All right, whatever. You know, you don't need him, and you never did. You never knew when to rely on others. That's your weakness. You know, people are waiting. They're waiting. They're waiting to see who Becky Something really is. Who is she? She's a woman. - She's a user. - A mother. - She's a deadbeat. - A person. A persona. - But you're healthy. - Recovering. All right. Well, who was Becky Something? A way to hide from Rebecca Adamcyzk. - And who is she? - I don't know. Nobody has seen her since I was 16. Momma, I'm bored. I know, sweetheart. Mommy's just catching up with Aunt Mari. Can we go outside to play? Yeah. Let's go outside. Come on. It hurts. That's how I broke my virginity. Yeah. - Awww. - Look at you. Hi, baby. Is this a mistake? Nah. Feels good. - Yeah, it's pretty. - Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty great. - Ah, you all look incredible. - Oh. Christ... we're not Lady Lazarus' damn phoenix. Oh, and this is my night. You tried hard as you could to torpedo the business, but somehow the company has survived for nearly 20 years, so let me throw a living wake for you. Anybody mind if we get a few quick photos over here? - Yes. - Oh, that's why you're here. Oh, you didn't think I actually wanted to see any of you? Come on. How's this take? Never seen this place sober. Yeah, I told you. It fuckin' sucks. Excellent. Hi. - I miss her. - All right. I'm starting to feel like a specimen. We ran from the stage when we heard you were here. Oh my god. Sit. So, how are things? Arms, our new record just came out. Yeah. No, I know. Oh, I know. And it's the best one yet. Everyone says the one we made together was the best one. That's because they're fucking assholes who don't want artists to change. I'm serious. Do you know... We have it on repeat. - I love it. - Thank you. Appreciate it. Hey, what about you? You doing anything after this? Tonight? No, like, in the future. - Um... - That's unknown. We're just trying to get through tonight. How crazy is this? You see Zelda's here? - No. - I'm sorry. Shit. Oh, man, no. It's totally fine. It's cool. We, you know, we talked and she heard what I had to say, so... Actually, is she still around? Down the hall. Maybe this... Maybe this means something. Yes. Excuse me. Something She? You're on in 20. It's so nice to see you guys together. She looks like she's doing great. Yeah. Yeah, she actually is, I think. You know there's, like, a lot of shit going on tonight, she cool with that? Yeah. I mean, probably, maybe... - We'll see. - Yeah. Yeah. I mean, people are getting really fucked up. - Yeah, we'll keep an eye on her. - Yeah, we got her. Don't worry. Becky! Oh, fuck. - You look awesome. - Yeah, Viv, I thought you'd be here. - For Howard, right? - Yeah, right on. - You wanna hang? - No, no. I just was looking for Zelda. She's partying with us. She just stepped out. Wait for her. No. No, I can't. But, um, just tell her I was looking for her. It's good to see you. Yeah, yeah. You doing the thing after? Maybe. Probably not, because, um, my daughter's here. - How's Tama? - She's really good. She's good. She's really big. - She's like seven, so. - I wanna see her. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I'll... I'll come find you. Change your mind? No, I'm sorry. I just didn't... I didn't realize it was... Becky Something, as I live and breathe. Hey, Z. Yeah, I was just looking for you. What's it all about? Hey, are you guys on soon? Well, well... Never thought I'd live to see the day. Yeah, you and me both, girl. You look good. Really good. Um... You looking for me? Yeah. You can say no, and you probably will, but I was just gonna have a little seance right now. Just like a very pure, just trying to find a clearing on my path before we, like, you know, do this thing, and I know it's only this song... So you'd probably just... I wanted to be surrounded by my... By some women, because I thought that that might help with... Relax. I'd love to. - Yeah? - It's cool. Time passes. Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, that's... All right. Cool. - All right. Yeah. After you. I'm Rebecca Adamcyzk. I rely on the strength of others for support. Thank you all for being here with me. Hi, I'm Mary Louise Hella. I'm here for you. Thank you for all being here with me. I'm Alexandra Derringer. I'm here for you. Thank you all for being here with me. I'm Caroline Sassinger. I'm here for you. Thank you all for being here with me. I'm Danielle Zakian. I'm here for you. Thank you all for being here with me. I am Michelle White. I'm here for you. Thank you all for being here with me. I'm Zelda Ellen Benson Harmon. And I'm here for you. Thank you for being here with me. - Your name really is Zelda? - Mm-hmm. Fuck, that's so cool. No matter what happens next, thank you for letting me be who I am. I've tried and I've tried and I've tried, and you've all stuck with me... Till the very end. Well... I better finish getting ready. - Thanks for letting me crash. - You're very welcome. I, uh... I know I wasn't always front row at the Becky show. Come on. You're backstage at the Becky show. Yeah, you are. All right. See you in a few. Hey, we should go chill. - I'm beat. - We're watching her set though. Oh, shit, yeah. That's one thing we absolutely cannot miss tonight. Wow. Well, I hope we don't disappoint. Pressure. You never do. What did you think she meant by "Until the very end"? It's just something people say. Yeah, maybe. Or... What are you thinking? No. I mean, what did we just do? What did Becky want from us? Strength to overcome, maybe. Yeah. Huh. Or... No. No, she's open. Not high. She was good. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I hope you're right. No, of course, of course. All right. Enjoy the show. - Can I get one? - Of course, yes. - Thank you. - Danny! Bye guys. Hey, how's it going, Zelda. Great to see you. - Hi. You must be Becky's mother. - Nice to see you. From the down the hall, I could have sworn it was her. Oh, right. Hi, beauty. - And you remember my wife Tiffany? - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Look at you. Hi, love. - I'm Zelda. - Roy. - Miss Z, can I get you anything? - I'm sorry. No, I'm all right, love. Thank you. So, how's radio, Dirtbag? You know, it is good. You know, we're merging with the competition. Payout, can't complain. Have you seen the girls yet? I just came from their room, actually. Want me to show you where it is? No, I think I can remember. - Okay. - Are we supposed to go through the balcony? Oh, nonsense. Come watch it from back here. I'll show you. Come on. Come with me. Ali is such a great singer. I always knew. I really love the album you two did. - Ah, you're the one. - Oh, stop it. Here it is. Guys, enjoy the show. Stop it, it's marvelous. - Seriously. - Appreciate it. All right, enjoy. You all right? Oh, yes, yes, yes! - Just who I wanted to see! - Aunt Mari! - Where's Rebecca? - Ah! - Congratulations! - Thank you. - Congratulations to you too. - She's, um... She's just gone to unwind or something before we play. - Oh, yeah? Which is when? - Ten minutes. - Ten minutes. - Yeah. I mean, she's probably meditating or something. Something She? Eight minutes until Something She. Eight! Geez, all right. Well, I'm gonna go look for her. I love you. Wait here. - Mari, hey. - Hey, V. - Have you seen Becky? - I saw her. - When? - Like two minutes ago in our room. - Okay. But you're all here. - Yeah, I left. Right, but when did you go? I'm sure it's fine. - Did you see how stoned Vivvy was? - Yeah. So, that's Vivvy. Becky shouldn't be hanging with her. Okay, I think she just said, "Hey Mar." Yeah, but it's not good to be around her. It's not good. It's fine. Give her the benefit. She's probably in her room. - No... - Just... no. Then she's somewhere else. Look, just relax. You're just nervous about the show. Did we lose Becky already? I mean, well, that is the question at the moment, actually. I was joking. Oh, goddammit. Not this again. One smooth night after all these years. Is that too much to ask? Look, I'm sure she's back right now. Oh. I'll just go, say hello to Dick, all right? I'm having a stroke. Where is she? Uh, Tama had to use the bathroom so Ania said she looked there. The Aker girls? Uh, negative. I just saw them. All right, that's five minutes, folks. Five minutes till show. - Thank you. - Vivvy? Uh, no. We have to play. So let's just... let's just go to the stage, and we'll find Becky waiting there. - Okay? - Yeah. Sure, we will. - Why don't you do your thing, okay? - Okay. We'll go find our seats? - They're on... - Seats? That way, yeah. Holy shit, look. She's there. She's ready. All right, four minutes. - Fuck. - Why is she standing like that? - I don't know. - She's nervous. - I know I am. - She's nervous? She's alone. - We need to get her out. - Yeah. - Should I... - Just us. Well? - She'll be fine. - Three minutes. "She'll be fine." What does that mean, "She'll be fine"? - She'll be fine. - Is she straight? Is she messed up? - Can she perform? - She's good! Greg, hey! Find Zelda. See if she can get on. Zelda's not going on. We are. Then tell me, what does this mean? It means whatever you want it to mean, Danny Boy. Did she take something? - Guess what? - Huh? Tama's here. I wanted to say good luck before your concert, Mommy. Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you. Go to Daddy, okay? Go on. I just have to be me, you know. And I know I've caused you a lot of pain, I'm sorry. And I don't know how to do it like that. For myself, I don't know how to do it... I can't. I don't know how to do it, I'm sorry. It's okay. Five seconds, guys. Forty-five to show. Howard, are you gonna introduce them in? - Here goes nothing. - Oh, Becky. Becky, darling, are you okay? Thank you. Thanks very much. I, uh... I first saw this next band almost ten... God, no, eleven years ago. Uh, they were opening for... Well, it doesn't matter who they were opening for, 'cause I left right after their set, ran backstage, dropped to my knees, and begged to let me sign them. And... And this woman, this once in a lifetime, never been anyone like her in the world, firebrand of a woman. Her hair dyed bright blue. Rebecca never knew how to go out there, exposed and alone. She never knew how. Yeah, but you're not alone now. - Yeah, you are never alone. - Okay. - Maybe their ninth... - Yeah, okay. So, you know what she does? She looks me in the eye and says "Who the fuck are you "to want to work with a star like me?" We have been together ever since, through the ups and the downs, a... friendly lawsuit or two. But mostly... Mostly it's the good times that I think about. Both of them. No, seriously, I love and respect the hell out of these women. And I'm proud to call them family. So please, give a paragon welcome for the first time together in nearly four years, Becky Something, Ali van der Wolff, Marielle Hell. Ladies and gentleman, Something She! Something She! Is it today? Is today the day I don't make it? No, today's not the day. - What do you think? - Get ready for the band! Come on out, ladies. Come on. There they are. Where you been? Thanks for the bullshit speech, Howard. I don't remember it happening like that at all. Do you remember it at all? I do remember the blue hair. Uh, wow. What to say, what to say, what to say! Uh, I know this is all about Howard, uh, but I've heard enough kind words about him, you know, to last a lifetime. Those are ones he just says himself. What else is there, what else? Gosh, it took me a lifetime... It took me a lifetime to realize that, uh... That, uh, without people like these women up here beside me, nobody's nothin'. And, um, I know that you've heard we haven't done this in a while, and I guess I'm a little, you know, pee-shy or whatever, and... I don't really even talk to them about this, and I'm sure Howard has some big bullshit finale planned that we're not included in, and I don't want to ruin it. But, uh, I'm gonna, 'cause I've been through some shit. So... Uh, there's lots of people that I wouldn't be here without, and, um, there's like, only eight of 'em here tonight and only four of 'em are musicians who are not in this band. So, um, would Crassie Cassie, Roxie Rotten, and Dottie OZ, and, you know what, just because I am full of love tonight, Zelda E. Zekiel, care to come up on stage and help me stumble through this bullshit? Becky! Becky! ...bullshit. We love each other, right? Come on.
