He died until the moon refused to shine any longer and erupted in blur, he died til the sun in the heaven refused to shine, but the story don't stop there, because he got up one morning, early one Sunday morning. The tune, the grave couldn't hold him. The stone was rolled away, and my God came out victoriously with all power in his hands. Lord, help me here. Good God, almighty. (loud music drowns out speaker) As I close here, he's so low, you can't go under him. He's so wide you can't go around him. (loud music drowns out speaker) Am I right about it?

For all the brother's in their life with gang banger, yeah, I wanna tell you a little bit about myself. When I was up in there, I was in it to win it. I was in it to where I didn't give a fuck, you know? To where it got to the point I was shooting people for no reason at all, I didn't care who I killed, or what I killed, now here I am, 30 years old, I'm gonna send a message out to y'all that's up in it, it's real, there's no life in it, fellas. I want to take y'all to 1980, when I done my first drive-by. Okay, I'm in the neighborhood on 127th Street, with my piece, (mumbles) I'm picking up my buddies Jeremy and Uzi Mike. We're going northbound up Normandy, you see, we see some rival enemies going southbound, down Normandy, it's to where I got a 32 automatic, you know, and we riding up, you know, we just rolling on up that thing. It's to where I see 'em, I get out (imitates gunfire), not thinking of what I'm doing, I just get all (imitates gunfire). So when we go, and we're on our way to go get us a stick or two, so we're rollin', you know, got to the point now, we come down Vermont, rolling down Vermont when we see some more rival enemies, to where I got off again (imitates gunfire), not thinking what I'm doing. That's the point. To where, now, here it is, I come back to the neighborhood, I'm sitting back, next thing I know, the police come around me, to where here I am now, going to jail for attempted murder for something I wasn't thinking about doing. So I'd have shot one person, turns around and shot three more, just not thinking in the life of gang banger. There's no future, fellas, to where here it is, now I'm in jail here facing 25 to life for something I'm not thinking about doing. (airplane roar drowns out speaker) We lived on a street called 127th Street, you know, man, it was from Normandy to west, and on this one block alone, between Dinkler and the Wholedell, man, I got five little homies dead off that one street, you know, it eats me up, man. I'mma start with Doc. Doc was, you know, talking with his girl one day, he standing in the middle of the street. This guy drive up, shoots him point blank, you know, for no reason at all, just kills him, well. I say for no reason at all, but I feel gang bangers for no reason, man, really. Get me to move down the block, man, like one, two, three houses, got another little homie named Gangster Loc, man, he's coming from taking the homies back, Mike, to the hospital, for his babies, one was just delivering a baby and shit, you know. So he comes on his beeper, you know his little beeper jump off, he stop at the motherfucking phone booth on Vermont, was smoked for no reason at all. Cold thing about it, they wait to kill him. They didn't go to bus on him or shoot him, put a paper bag over the wrist, and went to kill him, man, I mean, shot him point blank, and that was enough, that's just two, all for this one block, look. This is one little block, I ain't talking about a whole little block, I'm talking about right here on this one block. Then we just go in, he was still up in Gangster Lo house. Go to the next room, he got a brother named Ace, one of my little homies, man. This one guy, you know, he's in a gang, slangin' and shit, well this guy owed him $10.00, man. $10.00 funky-ass dollars. He want his money from this fool that owe him this money here, you know. So they get a little scuffle in the apartments and shit, 10 minutes later, Ace want to go home and get the nine, you see what I'm saying, go back up to this guy house, well all along, this is a grown man, this wasn't a kid he was playing with, this was a grown man, so when he, he went to this grown man's house, this grown man shot one time, shot him in the heart. Bam, that's three. We get to Lunatic, you know, that's my little, my baby sister's boyfriend, I like this black ass, you know, I liked him, you know, he was kind of wild, disrespectful to his, towards his family and shit like that, but I still loved that little black motherfucker, you know. Here it is, he was like let, I said my mama house, you know. I stayed in the neighborhood and shit on 125th Street, and I'm in my mama's house, you know, I'm like in the garage, I had some sherman in a bottle of water, so I'm dipping some sticks and shit, you know. So I like light one up, and I'm talking to Loony, you know, he come out of my little baby sister's bedroom, I'm talking to him and shit, you know, like, "Hey, what you gonna do tonight?" He's like, "Man, I'm gonna go on the six, man," porking him around that, so next I know, he go around that, right, so I happen to crash, me and the homegirl Tracy Wilson, we is like, in the living room, we is talking and shit, so I happen to crash and shit, right, well, I wake up the next morning, man. I hear my baby sister's (imitates screaming). So I wake up, I say, "Girl, what's wrong with you?" "Sean dead!" Oh, that fucked me up, man, I get up, put no socks on, get up, I walk around to his mama's house, you know, and like Ms. Gibson was like, I could see it in her, she's just hysterical, she just was gone, you know. And he was killed over a jacket, a goddamned jacket. Damn, that's number four. I get to number five was Poo Bear. He on 27th Street, that's when the street was rolling real tough like, you know. He's slangin' his little rocks and shit, right, so he go to this car, like three niggas up in this car, he go to the car slangin' the rock, they grab his arm and the rock and drag him from Western to Imperial, and left him dead right there. What killed me, though, what really, really fucks me up, man, you know, did not one of them live to be 25 years old. (laid back hip hop music) - [Voiceover] Fuck it, I'm Baby M from west side inland Crip, 111 Street, everybody kill on (mumbles). - [Voiceover] From the time you sleep, west side tripping (mumbles) to death. - [Announcer] I see, dog, 111's in the neighborhood, to the ground neighborhoods all around. - [Announcer] Little Prenny from west side, 111 Street original neighborhood Crip gang. - [Announcer] Big G from west side, 111 Street neighborhood Crip gang. - [Announcer] This baby sleep when he left me in the hood, stomped down to the ground. - The way my dead homies affected me is where, you know what I'm saying, I feel as though we shouldn't get along with nobody, you know what I'm saying?

It don't stop til the casket drop. - Like I was saying, you know, this shit gotta stop, man, this shit ain't no joke, you know what I'm saying. Y'all youngsters out here trying to grow up and hang and bang and do y'all thing, shit ain't no playground out here, you know what I'm saying?

Take one of my peoples over some bullshit that you're growing up and don't even know nothing about. You don't even know who the fuck started this shit, you know, think about what the fuck you're doing before you fuck your life up, man, 'cause jail time and shit and all these bullet wounds, just fucking up your whole record and everything, man, this ain't no joke for when you get older in the long run, you know what I'm saying? So before you do something, just think about the consequences you got to take, you know, and, man, be real about it, whatever you're doing. There's another nigga going down, sure'll be real. (laid-back hip hop music) - Hey, I'm Loc, from 103rd Street, Walsh is the place where we kick it, Walsh is the place where we hang at.

This is how it gotta go, so it's time for me to retaliate, you know, and I gotta let all you fools out there know, man, hey, sometimes you gotta give up and you gotta let go. But you ain't gotta let go to that part to where you just, you know, you just don't care no more or nothing like that, you know. I have to get up and I have to move on, you know. I got two little youngsters out there now, and I'm not saying, well, you know, if I be rolling today, or anything like that, and you know, and my kid's gonna catch it or something like that, you know, I'm not even gonna bring them near that. Like, when the kids be in the car with me, you know, I gotta tell my girl, "Hey, won't you teach the kids how "to get down on the floor?" You know, I hope it ain't gotta be like that, but sometimes it's like that, you know?

You know, we're not Americans, you know, we victims of, like Malcolm X said, of Americanism, so we've been robbed, you know what I'm saying, we are people who have been robbed of our knowledge, you know what I'm saying, of our self-respect, of our manhood, you know what I'm saying, so we been geared for self-destruction, so that's why you got the gang violence and you know, it's hard to respect another man because, you know, you don't feel like he deserve respect, you know, if he black, because we been programmed to hate anything black, and to love everything white, you know what I'm saying, and that go against our own nature. It's good to love everybody as long as they worth loving. You know, love and trust is something you gotta earn, so as far dead homies, you know, you're supposed to learn from they mistakes, you're supposed to learn from the living as well as the dead, but the dead ain't never coming back, so us as entertainers and actors and all that, we gotta speak for those who can't speak. We gotta speak for the dead, 'cause they're not coming back, you know what I'm saying, this is the only life you got, ain't no pie in the sky after you die, you know, if you think it is, then prove it to me, you know what I'm saying, this is it right here, this is our heaven and our hell, you know what I'm saying, this is reality, so, you know, basically, that's it, you know, peace on out for the dead homies. - What's up. - What's up. - And one things I want to say to you brothers out into that gang life over the United States, all over the world.

We ain't out here S-ing on our chest, but you know, it's like everybody out here want to be a tough guy, a killer, a gangster, you understand, but most of the killers and gangsters I know either got all day or dead, so everybody out here just living, so, you know, we kickin' it from that perspective. - This is 40 ounce from Campanella Park, you know what I'm saying, Piru, west side Piru all the time, you know what I'm saying, P-Funk, you know what I'm saying, blood in general, 'cause I respect all bloods, you know what I'm saying, and any man, you know what I'm saying, but, you know, I just got out of jail, you know what I'm saying. Couple way this is juvenile, you know what I'm saying for you youngsters, get out, you know what I'm saying, walking down the street, you know what I'm saying, go over to my girl's house, we bick it for a minute, you know what I'm saying, go to McDonald's, get something to eat and shit, you know what I'm saying, on the way back, I dump her off at the house, I bail down the street, you know what I'm saying, some fool on a bike, you know what I'm saying, roll up on a bike, I'm thinking it's my homie on my bike, you know what I'm saying, I run up to him, "What's up, homie?" He shot me in the neck, bam, I break and shit, you know what I'm saying, shot me up, you know what I'm saying, but nigga survived, you know what I'm saying, I'm still, you know what I'm saying, I'm right here today, you know what I'm saying, living for you youngsters, you know what I'm saying, and if y'all wake up, you know what I'm saying, could be a better place, but we need y'all. - Well, I'm speaking out there for you young soldiers out there, you know. I've been through a lot of shit, you know, Moms doing bad, I'm doing bad, I'm surprised I'm living right now there, you know what I'm saying I'm talking to y'all, you know. I lost homies, all kinds of shit, you know. Lost one of my homies doing a ride over some stupid shit, you know, one of my best friends right now in jail, my big homie Goo, you know, he doing 27 years for robbery, we was out there awhile, buck wild, like five, we was doing five or 10 robberies a day, all kind of bullshit, you know, G rides, stealing, you know, just fucking motherfuckers up on the side, but, you know, I'm just telling you right now, it's time to slow that shit down. It's '94, niggas out here getting popped quicker than you know it. Your mama and your family getting died, everybody getting killed, they don't give a fuck who you are, if they can't find you, they'll get your family. You know, I'm just telling you right now, you know, this shit ain't no joke. - They call me G-12, I'm from Athens Park, yeah. I started burying, you know, my pops, Big Mouse, you know, me and my twin brother, it's like, my twin, he been through a lot of stuff, you know what I'm saying. He almost got killed, he got like, in crossfire up in the party where other bloods died, you know what I'm saying. Niggas bickin' it, getting high, whatever, drinking, partying, and, you know, it's like other bloods, they get into it, and it's like, all these niggas just come out with straps, start shooting, my brother, he gets shot in the chest, both his legs, you know what I'm saying, he on the ground, but he rolling over, but they started shooting at him. But they supposed to be bloods, it's like, you know what I'm saying, that shit was all crazy. He almost lost his life with that shit. I'm locked up, though, I can't do nothing about it, you know what I'm saying, but I can feel it, you know what I'm saying, he's my twin brother. It's like every time something happen to him, I know. It's like, I just feel it, 'cause I'm a twin, you know what I'm saying, it's all crazy. But, you know, niggas need to come up, wake up, you know what I'm saying, look at yourself. (laid back hip hop music) - My name is Dwayne, a lot of my homeboys call me French Dog, Nickerson Gardens, Watts, bounty hunters, a lot of my homeboys tell me, you know, that I always got to be down, you know, we all must be down with the hood and stay down with the hood. Well, you know, I'm a for real believer in that, you know, so I'mma always stay down for my hood and be for real with my set, you know. But I look at it like this here, I'm not gonna sit out here and try to think of what to sell, anything I can do, I just ask the Lord to bless me, for whatever come out of my mouth to be natural. So only thing I can say to the people and the young brothers out there that's coming up today, that caught themselves on a bang, and all that kind of shit, I mean, I got dead homies, you know what I'm saying. I know we all got dead homies, but look at this here, I did six years out of 11 years in Folsom Penitentiary, you know what I'm saying, and I prayed every night that I'd be able to make it to be able to come out here and live just to be with my family and shit, you know. I look at a lot of brothers today, they run around here with something on they chest trying to impress the other homeboys and all that kind of shit, the only thing I can say, man, just try to be a real man and be your own man, you know what I'm saying, but don't never neglect your set, you know what I'm saying. But it's the way you do it, you do it with style, you know. Like me for instance, right. I got out, I been out two years now, you know. I'm not gonna try to make a long list of things that I done did constructive or something, like I said, but one thing I can say, you know, I feel good about my life now as a person, you know, as a black man first, you know, I'mma always love my hood and I'mma always remember where I came from, you know. But I look at it like this here. You, you got to be happy with yourself, you got to live with you, you got to be happy and contented by who you are as a person, you know. You can't go around, and you're confronting other people and try to be hard, and paper trail, all that kind of BS, you know what I'm saying, but deep down in your heart, you know what's happening with you as a man, you know what I'm saying. So the only thing I can say is like this here. Like I say, some of my homeboys today, they landed, I say, well, you know what I'm saying, six feet dead, you know, and they ain't never gonna be able to see life again, you know. The ones that's dead, they family running around here, they kids running around all loose and stuff, you know what I'm saying, so the only thing I can do as a black man is get my life together, be able to come back down in the neighborhood and make a contribution to the younger ones that's coming up today. I want to be able to sit down with them and tell them what life has been about for me, you know. Right now I go to college, I got me a job, you know, I ain't making much, I'm making like $7.12 an hour, I mean, some people call that peanuts, but I still feel good about myself knowing that I can do something with my life. They always said odds are against us. Yeah, the odds gonna be against us, but it's what can you do, what are you gonna try to do? Are you just going to accept that and just say, "The odds are against me"? No, don't say that, man, if anything, man, get yourself together, get your life together, man, and stop all that perpetrating and trying to front, you know what I'm saying. Me, I love the Nickerson Gardens, you know what I'm saying, I love it for what it taught me and shit, you know what I'm saying, it taught me a lot about myself, and most of all, it made me for real a man, you know what I'm saying, and I don't care what nobody say. All that shit, trying to be hard and shit, just keeping strapped and shit, the strap what the motherfucker need to keep is in his mind, that's the strap, 'cause the gat that you need to have is in your mind, and how you gonna make it out here in this life in society today, and what it's gonna take to go out and challenge these obstacles. But like I say, all I want to do is just be myself, be a black man, and take care of my family, be responsible, and come back in my neighborhood and say, "Look," you know what I'm saying. I know what it's about, homeboy. I want to be able to take some of the younger brothers and stuff, you know what I'm saying, go to parks or something, kick back, or sit down, we can talk and stuff, man, you know what I'm saying, 'cause a lot of us black men today, yeah, we gang bangin', but let's gang bang, let's be our leader in our household first, take care of our families, you know what I'm saying, set an example for our younger ones today, you know what I'm saying, show them what life is about, you know. Not come out here and try to perpetrate and put a strap in our pockets or something and go around here and try to kill the next man 'cause he's got this color car or something, or he might have a blue car, or he might have, you know what I'm saying, a red car, whatever the situation may be, be a leader in your household first before you come out here being frank talking about, "I'm from this hood," or something like that. Be a hood for your family first, you know what I'm saying. - For me it wasn't like no peer pressure thing, you know, I'm just jumping on the bandwagon, I'mma do this 'cause all the homeboys are doing it. My thing is like, you know, growing up in a certain neighborhood, you have altercations with people that grew up on another part of a certain neighborhood, and you grow up and you know it's affiliation through association. And in coming up with that, you know what I'm saying, I just, my mama just happened to have her house on the side where the red team was at, so there it is, right there, and in doing that, you know, you growing up doing everything out in the streets, from murder, money, violence, to sex, and the out of town, going out of town with doing your work and all of this, that's all been done, you know what I'm saying. It's '94, you gotta have a new twist with things. You know, I did a year in juvenile, you know what I'm saying, four and a half years in the state penitentiary, you know, I done been to damn near all of them, Folsom, Quentin, Soledad, you know, Jamestown, Solano, Vacaville, you know, on tour, so as far as like, all the negatives, I've seen. Now as a, in my life at this point, I'm making a transition to do positive things, and to, you know, try to alleviate a lot of the bullshit that's going on out here in the streets with these youngsters that ain't knowing, you know, they don't know that these white folks got a place for them for the rest of they life. They might not never even see they neighbor and be in a penitentiary five, 10 years, and never even see the person next to 'em in the next cell, 'cause they got places for 'em, with these drive-bys, automatic weapons, everything that's going on out here, the dope, you know, they want to give us all day for catching two or three ounces hard, and you know what I'm saying, they catch John Delorean with 100 keys in a camera and give him a smack on the hand. So you see what's going on, so you got to, you know what I mean, peep game and just, you know, stay above water, you know what I'm saying, and with the Crips and the Bloods and this truce, and all this, you know, I didn't participate with the truce because I didn't feel like it was being put down right, you know what I'm saying. I don't need to be drinking and hanging out with you to kick it with you, you understand? You stay in your neighborhood, keep your people organized, deal with your people, I stay in my neighborhood, deal with my people, keep them organized, when you see me, give me a pass, when I see you, I give you a pass. But all this "Oh, we gonna hang out," and all that, I still think, you know, we need to go through some more steps and level before we get to that point, 'cause I don't think everybody be sincere about, you know what I'm saying, puttin' this gang thing behind us. And I know a lot of people being killed behind it, a lot of lives being taken, you know what I'm saying. But my thing be like this, people want to be gangsters, they want to put work in, want to do this, but you can go around the corner and just shoot up three or four black men, the sheriffs get behind you, you got two Aks in a car, four TEC-9s, you know what I'm saying, 10 pistols, and they tell you to freeze, you stop, you understand? They only two individuals with two guns, you just went and shot four or five blacks up, but you freeze when they tell you. I'm saying, if you're a gangster, sell the ranch, grandma, grandpa, the chickens, everything if you're going out with bullets and gun smoke, don't just stop with yours, you understand me? Deal with it on that level, if that's what you're doing. If you're not, get out the way, let somebody else that is, quit perpetratin'. - Man, we do a thing, it's called respect, you know what I'm saying? We don't be getting caught out of pocket in another nigga's neighborhood, you know what I'm saying, and then wonder why they killed us and shit, you know what I'm saying? Man, you know, that's just dumb shit, you stay out of the other nigga's neighborhoods, you ain't got to worry about it, you know what I'm saying. 'Cause the banger thing ain't never gonna cease, you know, it's gonna always be neighborhoods, you know what I'm saying. It might get cooled down, but as long as these white people still alive and you got these sheriffs and all this running around, it's gonna always be on, 'cause they can keep some shit stirred up. - Because it's gangs, it's gangs, political gangs, you got street gangs, you got women gangs, you got gangs, the Senate, the Senate is a gang, like, if one of the Senate gets smoked, they lost a dead homie, you know, for sheriffs, they lost their, they got dead homies, everybody got dead homies. Fuck it, it's a big gang war, you know what I'm saying? - Dead homies, that's right, dead homies. It's fucked up, they gotta be dead, it's fucked up we gotta do this to appreciate 'em. We could've appreciate them while they was living, you know what I'm saying, we could have did a documentary then, it's fucked up, man. - But it's not just the homies, it's some people that don't even know what's going on that's dead right now because of the homies, like, for instance, a little incident happened in my neighborhood, one night we kicking it, a car drove by, and we threw up our signs to the car or whatever, and the car just stopped for a minute and took off, came back around the corner, and at the same time, a homeboy, Anty, was walking down the street, and she got like a little Afro back then, so she looked kind of masculine, or whatever you want to, how you want to put it, and they jumped out, and they started shooting at us and we ran, and they shot her in the stomach, she doesn't even know what's going on, she just got caught in a twist, we come out the hiding spaces and stuff and where we was at ducking and whatever, she laying on the ground, stomach wide open, and I'm like, "Damn." This, you know what I'm saying, this not just the dead homies, it's anybody, man, and that's what I don't like. That's really what I don't like, it could be little kids and the girls and the grandmamas and all this, they don't have to be involved in this, they don't even know what time it is. It's a lot of punks, punks pull the trigger every day, it ain't no, a man to me is a man that'll come from here, when you in the streets, a lot of punks, anybody could pull the trigger, so I don't have no respect for them. That's what I say about my dead homies. - What, it's P-Funk all the motherfucking time, Milla.

The Lord works in mysterious ways. - [Ms. Young] Yes, Lord. - The Bible says the Lord will come like a thief in the night. Well, on this particular night he came looking just like you guys, in a speeding car shooting at some guys hanging out. Missed every last one of them, and hit my boy right through his eye. They say he never knew what hit him, but I know, and you know, and that's why I've got to warn you, because you might not see tomorrow if you keep up this madness against yourselves and against your people. Some of you may think it's revenge or self-defense, but it's nothing more than an ever-revolving cycle of death, genocide, you've got to come together and deal with this problem. And stop letting the other kind, the white man, deal with it, because you know how they deal with it, they sell you space in a big yard to bury one in, and they lock the other one up like an animal. They call it justice, but I call it killing two birds with one stone. Let me remind you what the most clearest and simplest of those 10 great commandments is. Thou shalt not kill, yes, God said that. He didn't say thou shalt not kill unless you are a Blood, he didn't say thou shalt not kill unless you are a Crip. He said, "Thou shalt not kill." You know what tickles me is everything that you believe in, this thing that will kill, or you will die for, it isn't even yours. Your hood? I spoke with some gang members from Inglewood and the freeway project came in and tore their hood down, and moved them somewhere else. Another thing that puzzles me is how come every benefits from gang banging but gang bangers? You go to the Koreans at the swap meet to get your khakis, your T-shirts, your tennis shoes and your hats. The media's guaranteed a story, the hospitals stay full, the mortuaries are making a killing, pardon the expression. The police are cleaning up in overtime. You see, they don't want you to stop doing what you're doing as long as you kill each other and stay in your own neighborhood, but the minute that you step out of bounds and threaten one of them, in comes the National Guard and everybody else. And through the newspaper and the television, they make you big men, oh, but when they make you, they want to make you for them, not for yourself or your people. They want to make sure that you use your influence in a proper way, they use our own natural desire to be in a group, then they feed us guns and make us kill each other. So the homeowners, they flee the neighborhood, and they bought up more and more homes, then the developers come in, and they develop the properties for white people. They take us and move us out to the suburbs so they can take back the city and the power in the city. But you don't hear me, though. You've got to stop worshiping these streets and avenues, and start worshiping yourselves and your people. Because if we have cultural unity, we have everything. I know you miss your dead homies. I miss my dead homies, too. But if we keep this up, we'll just keep filling up the graveyards and the jailhouses, and that's exactly what they want us to do. You know, the Lord wants to set us all free, we've all got some kind of problem that we just can't seem to get rid of, we just can't seem to shake it, but I guarantee you that if you pray and if you praise God and if you study his word, whatever it is, he will unshackle it from your body. - [Congregation] Hallelujah. - Oh, father, everybody in this audience wants to submit to you, father, and to your spirit. Let them know that you are in control at all times so that they can praise you when they are winning, and they can praise you when they are losing. (slow piano music) You young men, I talk to you today, may you all come up here, stand up, come up here and receive prayer, 'cause you got burns on your hearts, you got problems in your lives, this is the alter, just praise God, come on up, brothers, it's the best thing you can do with your lives, just praise God. The answer is now, come on up. I'm talking to you, you, you, I'm talking to all of you. Stand up now, do something positive with your lives. It's time to set these guns down, it's time to let go and let God. Come on up, brothers. (slow piano music) (laid back hip hop music) - There is an open gate at the end of the road, through which each must go alone. And there is a light we cannot see our father claims as his own. But beyond the gate, your loved ones find happiness and rest and comfort in the thought that a loving God knows best. (mumbles) I will say I'd do this this time, to commit brother Darryl Young body to the grave, ashes to ashes, dust to dust, and earth to earth, and our inspiring duty to believe that one day, God shall bring about the resurrection of this body from the grave, amen. ♪ 'Cause when your homie die, it hurts ya ♪ My only true homie was the victim of a homicide ♪ And I miss you ♪ Another fool is gone now ♪ I've got to pay the price, yeah ♪ But I grew up being told ♪ killing people was really bad, yeah ♪ But you really don't care about that ♪ when you're mad and sad ♪ Well, God bless my soul ♪ I've had to do some time ♪ But I had to something to kill the pain inside ♪ 'Cause when your homie dies, it hurts ya ♪ It hurts ya, it hurts ya ♪ 'Cause when your homie dies, it hurts ya ♪ Oh ♪ It hurts ya, it hurts ya ♪ Your heart and your soul, you can't control ♪ Oh, it hurts ya, oh, it hurts ya ♪ It hurts ya, it hurts ya ♪ Every morning and every night ♪ I think about me and my homie when we was tight ♪ Clownin' with hoes, toking fat endo ♪ Y'all know how it go ♪ When you grow up in the city ♪ Not really giving a fuck about any ♪ But your next bro ♪ Then your next penny, like Lenny ♪ But we should have listened to sensei ♪ Moving plenty ♪ And we're meant to laugh and sing ♪ For the way we kicked our rhymes ♪ To the liquor we drank ♪ So you know when I found out my homeboy died ♪ Oh, it hurts ya ♪ All I could think about was revenge ♪ As the tears fell from my eyes ♪ 'Cause when your homie dies, it hurts ya ♪ Oh, it hurts ya, it hurts ya ♪ 'Cause when your homie die, it hurts ya ♪ Yeah ♪ It hurts ya, it hurts ya ♪ To the point where you feel like ♪ You just half-dead ♪ And you can't get them visions out your mind ♪ Of that bullet in his head ♪ It makes you feel like ♪ I should have been there for him at the time ♪ But now I can't go on, it's just in my mind ♪ Until I was able to figure out ♪ That we still a unit ♪ And everything about our music is - Hey, blood, we rollin' on these niggas tonight, you know, fuck that shit, I don't want no bullshit, it's your time, nigga, this your time. - [Moon] I'm driving, blood. - [Mike] You know what, I'mma fuck you up every time I see you if you don't be down. - [Moon] You're acting like a bitch, nigga, them niggas killed your brother, nigga. - [Mike] With your brother gone, I'll fuck you up every time I see you. - [B-Fool] Look, blood, fuck that shit, I mean tonight, blood, we rolling-- - [Moon] You ain't got to do all that, nigga, we go, go, nigga. - Fuck that shit, man-- - [Mike] You be a man, nigga, this is for the set, nigga.
