[MOTORCYCLE ENGINES ROARING] [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE STARTING] [BIKE TIRES SCREECHING] [SCREAMING] [INDISTINCT TALKING] MAN: Somebody call an ambulance. Get up! [ENGINE STARTING] MAN: They're getting away! [INDISTINCT TALK] [SURFER ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Foosh. [BLOWING KISSES] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [CHUCKLING AND CHATTERING] [WHISTLING] [WHOOPING] [CHATTERING AND CHEERING] [WHISTLING] [HOWLING] [BIKE ENGINES ROARING] -Grog. -Yeah? Have you ever been a father? I used to have a father once. How'd you like to be mine? Are you some kind of a nut? [WHOOPING] [MUSIC STOPS] Good strain. CODY: He didn't mention it to me, Leroy. Did he mention it to you? -Didn't say a word to me, Cody. -Huh. The point is, uh... -That Gage just snuffed a citizen. -Yes, he did. CODY: And that makes one dead dude, one hot Skull. Now, I'm not mad at you, Gage. I'm not mad at you. [CHUCKLING] Anybody could do what you did, just run away like that. Yeah, we could have done the same, right, Leroy? Yeah, yeah. Right, Cody. But you know, that's hit and run, which means the man is looking for Gage, which means by coming here he's brought heat on us... Which means I ought to push you right around the block. [ALL LAUGHING] The point is that Gage's bike is hotter than he is. So let's strip it the hell down and get out of here, huh? All right, we ain't got too much time now. No goof and let's get it done, huh. Hey, do I smell pizza? Rip off a hunk. [CHUCKLES] Oh, yeah, Gage is a bad face. LEROY: Have you taken a good look at yourself lately? -Uh, did you get packed for the big run? -Yeah, I guess. -LEROY: You got us packed? -Uh-huh. You better have us packed 'cause we're not coming back. Oh, we got to be back by Thursday 'cause it's another dance contest. -Forget it. -What do you mean "Forget it"? Forget it. He says forget it, I say forget it, 'cause he is me and I is he and we is we. JOEL: Hey, Cody? You know Hank Fredericks is still in the hospital? LEROY: Yeah, so? JOEL: And Pete McCarthy almost got busted on Thursday? You know Matt the Hat's still doing 15 to 20? And Will Perkins we haven't heard from since the run to Big Bear. Well, nothing new there at all, is there? Ooh! Stop! Listen, what I'm saying is, if five years ago, we... Yeah, I know what you're saying. JOEL: Man, we are washed up. Well, maybe we're washed up... When I die, and I'm there and you're here, throw a lily on my grave. Careful when you burn down the engine nose. Don't make no deep scratches and don't try to save the tires. They have to bust every one of us to get my bike now. Gage, sometimes I think you guys want to get busted. You know, five years ago there were 200 of us and the town knew it. And now there are 26 left [CHUCKLES] and we got to sneak around like a bunch of dips. Look, the dumb squirt got right out in front of me, I couldn't help it. Yeah, well, I'll tell you one thing, you're lucky the Man wasn't around. The Man was there. Every time we go out we come face to face with the Man. We take one drink and there's the Man, and we hop on our signals and the Man is on our tail. Now look, the Man is out there and he's going to bust us all. Joel. Joel. Uh, tell 'em that story about Butch Cassidy, you told me. Hmm, Cassidy. He was an outlaw. He had maybe 400 men under him. And they had their own town, a place called Hole-in-the-Wall. They had a cannon up in the pass and the whole cavalry tried to take him and couldn't. Like they was home free. Never did get took. Yeah, well, I've decided we're going to split from this pad. We're going to pick up our old ladies and whatever little we have and we're going to put on our colors and we're going to roll. And neither man nor beast is going to stop us until we find a place where we can blow our own peace, and we're going to love each other. -I love you, Leroy. -Cody, I love you. [ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Anybody got anything to say? Yes, I'm going to have a baby. [ALL LAUGHING] [MOTORCYCLES REVVING] [ENGINES ROARING] Okay, you all set? Yeah, we got the food and the extra oil and the fuel tanks are full. We don't have to stop till we get to Lenning. Okay, let's pick up Funky, we'll go on the bridge. You really think it's smart to bother with Funky? His head's pretty twisted. He really wants to be a citizen. Don't you worry about ole Funky! Funky! -[LAUGHING] -Hey, by the way, where are we going to end up? Hole-in-the-Wall! Hey, Cody, I don't think it's fair to have to leave my partner in the dance contest. There ain't going to be no dance contest. We're not coming back, we're going to Hole-in-the-Wall. When God created Woman he made her pretty stupid. Let's go! [ENGINES ROARING] [DOG BARKING] [MOTORCYCLES APPROACHING] Hey, did a cat named Funky Davico do this? -It's as pretty as a picture. -Yeah, which way does the old funk live? -Brown house on top of the hill. -That way? -Bye. -[LAUGHS] That way. Thanks a lot! Funky! ALL: [YELLING] Funky! [INDISTINCT SPEAKING] Funk? Where's the Funky? [ALL LAUGHING] I hate to tell you this, Cody, but Funky's in the can. -[CHUCKLES] Oh, no. -Yeah? What did he do now? Nothing! Not a damn thing. Except he got a little loaded and he painted this picture on the town hall. -Yeah, we saw that! -[ALL LAUGHING] They put him in the joint for public indecency. LEROY: That's what you get for trying to be a citizen. -How much is the bail? -Oh, $500. Ah, we don't have $500, but we'll grab his chopper and we'll go into town. We'll get him out of there somehow. Hey, and then guess what? We're all going to the boondocks and live forever. Oh, no. -The boondocks? -Yeah. -Gee, I don't know. -Why do I love her? See, we got this house here. I guess we're kinda crazy about it. Not that the town's too crazy about us, but... [ALL LAUGHING] Listen, you haven't heard the best part yet. The Stompers is having a party up the bridge and we're going to get us girls to wisty. -ALL: Yeah! -Leroy. Party with the Stompers? Oh, hell! Wait till I get my toothbrush... [ALL CHEERING] -Leroy! -Cody! Leroy, I love you! [MEN WHISPERING] Funky! [WHISPERING] Funky! Funky!

I love you! [LAUGHING] -Man, it was one original mistake moving to this town. -Shh. -[SPITS] It stinks! -They all stink! -[SPITS] -Let's hope they have no jails in Hole-in-the-Wall. Yo, man, Hole-in-the-Wall ain't even in the state of California. -[BOTH SPIT] -Okay, let's go. [ENGINES ROARING] [INDISTINCT YELLING] I'll do it. I'll do it! I'll do it! [LAUGHING] Oh, Funky, it's good to have you back running with us again. Well, I got a hot news for you guys, Funky Davico ain't about to settle down again. Not now. That's what I was going to say. "Not now." That's what I said. Not now. -Nor never. -Nor never. Nor never! -I'll drink to that. -Hey, man. [LAUGHING] I'm not going to stay around here and listen to this pack of lies. Come on, you mule. Come on, you mule! -[IMITATING KISSES] -[LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] Watch how I give my old lady a kiss. -BOTH: Eee! -[LAUGHING] Oh, our leader, ain't he beautiful. [LAUGHING] Thanks. Climb out of that sleeping bag. -Huh? -Get out of the bag. -I can't get out of the bag, Cody, I'm stone naked. -Good. That's good, isn't it? Come on, get out of that bag, I got to cover up my chopper in case it snows. -[BOTH CHUCKLING] -You're putting me on again. If you want this bag you're gonna have to take it off of me. That's just what I'm going to do if you're not out of there -by the time I count three. -Don't you touch me, Cody. One! -Two! -No, Cody! Three! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [LAUGHING] [ENGINES ROARING] Hey, fill her up! [INDISTINCT TALKING] -I'm hungry. -Let me go. Hey, dude. Now don't you holler at Robot. Don't you know that he's got seven discs fused in his spine, man? Leroy, Leroy, Leroy. Don't you know this is the man behind the man behind the man behind your bike? -I'm hungry, Leroy. -Robot's hungry, Cody. Hey, man. This is the time to stock up, look. -Joel! -JOEL: Let's go! -Bye bye. Come on, eat! -[INDISTINCT YELLING] I never laid a club on him! And we're going to go in there and we're going to act like a bunch of dudes! Yeah, we're dudes! We're dudes! And we're going to go in there and we're not going to steal anything. [YELLING] All right, okay. We might steal something. [CLAMORING] [LAUGHING AND YELLING] -How you doing, man? -Hey, baby. -Hey! -Hey! [WHOOPING AND CHATTERING] What have we got here. Check this out. [GLASS CLANKING] [HUMMING] Should have made a list, what have I forgotten? Beer? -Beer? -Mmm. No, not beer. Hey, man, that's groovy. Yeah. Hey, Daddy, I stole it so it's mine. All right, it's yours! Will there be anything else? -Will there be anything else? -Will there... Will there be anything else? Anything else! Anything else! Anything else! Anything else!

[WHISTLES] [BIKERS QUIET DOWN] -Let's split. -What about my store? Hey, cool it, huh. Hey, come on. [LAUGHING] -[BALLOONS POPPING] -[LAUGHING] Hey, man, you forgot my green stamps. [SHOUTING] Get in! The bill comes to $43.76. We ain't got any money, man. -You got any money? -No, I ain't got no money. You? Hey, you people just ripped my shop. Who's going to pay for all this? Look, we'll pay for it on the way back, okay? -The police... -There ain't going to be no police now, is they? Is they? -How much do I owe you? -Uh, the whole total is $43.76. -$43.76? -$43.76. Okay. [COUNTING BILLS] Now look, if you don't cut it out, man, we're going to come back after you. Now beat it. -Hey, they're gone! -[YELLING] Another perfect day into another perfect vacation. [ENGINES ROARING] [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] -[YELLING] -Move 'em out! I can't figure out what to do with this. [LAUGHS] [ENGINES ROARING] I hope you've got this camping business out of your system now. Okay, honey, next year we'll get a boat. [CARNIVAL MUSIC PLAYING] All righty! Have the girls got all their tomatoes? GIRLS: Yeah. How about our victim. Ready as I'll ever be, Royce. Okay, girls. [GIRLS GIGGLING] Let him have it! [CROWD LAUGHING] [WHISTLING AND CHEERING] [DOG BARKING] There ain't a soul to be seen, man. Must have heard we was coming. [LAUGHING] Funky. So we don't scare anyone, I'll run down to the campground and see if I can find a place to sleep for the night. This is as dead a town as I ever did see. Uh, let's take a walk and see what's shaking. Funky, cool it, will you. I'll get back. [ENGINE STARTING] Ooh, I sure could use me a beer, Robot. Oh, didn't Cody say for us to stay around here, Leroy, huh? Yeah, he did. Now let's get us a beer anyway, huh? Wa... You sure it's all right to leave, Leroy, huh? -Yeah, it's all right, let's go. -Okay, yeah, beer! [CHATTERING] [CROWD CHEERING] Now I know one or two of you out there is not planning on voting for Charlie Henderson as sheriff. [CROWD REACTING] But he's got my vote as the best sport in town. Now how about that? -[CROWD CHEERING] -[WHISTLING] I feel just like a pizza. [CROWD LAUGHING] And now, while Charlie's being cleaned up, we're ready for the finals of the beauty contest. Now let's give a hand to our home grown beauties! [CROWD CHEERING] We're full-up. You're full-up? Yes. We're full-up. You're full-up. Well... Uh, we've come a long way and we're tired. We need a place we can lay down. Well, how many? Just you two? That's right. Just we two. Here. And there are 32 more down there. We're full-up. Yeah, it's the world's most beautiful woman. [CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING] ROYCE: Let's hear your vote! [CROWD CHEERING] ROYCE: Thank you. Thank you, Susie Hamilton. Now will the next gorgeous creature step forward and face the music. [MAN CHEERING] [CROWD CHEERING] [BIKERS BOOING] [LAUGHING] Folks, this is Marianne Fielding. Now Marianne's family is new in town, so let's give her an extra special hand to welcome her to Brookville! [CROWD CHEERING] [BIKERS BOOING] [WHISPERING] Charlie Henderson back here, fast! Now I guess you all know who this next one is. Will the third girl please step forward? [CROWD CHEERING AND WHISTLING] [BIKERS BOOING] Well I guess that's that. The winner, and the most beautiful girl in Brookville and maybe the world, is Clara Hayes. -[BIKERS BOOING] -[CROWD CHEERING] Mayor, the cup. Congratulations, Clara. Hear, hear! MAN: Hey, come over here. What's happening, Cody? They won't let us stay any place tonight. -No room? -What do you mean? No room for us. -Wait, why? -It's ridiculous, right? [LAUGHING] Who are those ruffians out there? What's this, Leroy? You hit the stump with the hammer and try to ring the ding-dong, Robot. [GIGGLING] Give me, give me. [THUDDING] [BELL DINGING] [CHUCKLES] Ding-dong. Come on, throw it! What is this, man? Come on, throw at it. -I can't believe you. -[WOMAN SCREAMING] Vandals. Filth. -[LAUGHING] -[SHOUTING] My old lady! My old lady! [LAUGHING AND CHEERING] Hey, Funky, I ain't done this in years. Now you can stop complaining I never take you no place nice. [KISSING SOUND] [CACKLING] Hey, short skirt! -Come over here. -Let the man in. Come over here. How about you give me a kiss, yeah? Sorry, sir, but only residents can play. -[CHORTLING] -The hell you say. GIRL: I'd like to give you a kiss. ALL: Oh. What else would you like to sell? Marianne, go and get another roll of tickets from Hank. Aww. [GRUMBLING] So you're not going to sell us any kisses? -MARIANNE: That's right. -[BLOWS RASPBERRY] -Maybe I talk to her a little bit. That's all. -That's it. Hey, are you a mama? Hell no, I'm just pregnant. [SURFER ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] There you go, mama! [WHOOPING AND CHEERING] You like it, huh? Yes. Want to go for a ride? Oh, I... I don't know. Ah, come on. Okay. [ENGINE REVVING] [MOTORCYCLE DRIVES OFF] BIKER 1: I bet you a six-pack against a couple of joints I can beat you. BIKER 2: I think you're on. [BIKERS CLAMORING] Hey, mister, better look out for Theodore. He stinks. [BIKER IMITATING RABID DOG] Hey, wait a minute. Where did you get that stuff? I stole it. I stole it from a crippled old grandmother. Hey, Funky, come on now. JOEL: Hey, that's right, dude. And he broke both her arms too. -[IMITATES SOUND] -[CHUCKLING] -Look, I happen to be the mayor of this town... -Oh! Funky Davico. Glad to make your acquaintance. -What I'd like you to do... -Don't talk to him, Mayor. We'll need help. Listen, mister. Funky didn't steal this stuff. He won it fair at the horserace game. [FUNKY LAUGHING MANIACALLY] Shut it down, right now. [CARNIVAL MUSIC STOPS] [PEOPLE COMPLAINING AND BOOING] Well, now, don't you tell me. I paid two bits for a chance on the Thunderbird and I ain't... I want my two bits back. Get your filthy hands off me. -Charlie. -Leroy. Leroy. What's happening here? Are you the leader of this outfit? Yes, sir, I sure am. Well, get them out. What did they do? Break some law or something? What do you want here? Trouble? Oh, no, sir. Anything but. We're just looking for someplace we can flake out. -We don't want you here. -Why not? Why would anyone want a pack of junkies in filthy clothes plastered with emblems? Who constitute a mobile disturbance to the peace and do everything possible to antagonize and frighten the general public. We're just looking for some place we could flake out. If I let you sleep on the beach, will you stay put and be out by sun up? You got my word on that. Good, because I'm holding you personally responsible, is that clear? Ain't nothing to worry about. I'm not worried. I've got a hotline direct to the highway patrol. You know how popular you are with them. You've got five minutes to hit the beach. Life may not be beautiful if you cooperate with the law, but it'll be a lot simpler. Take the south end of the beach, below the camp ground. And clean it up before you leave. Okay, Sheriff. Come on, let's get out of here. [GROANING AND MUMBLING] The Man ain't all bad, Leroy. You said they can stay on the beach. That's right. They'd be isolated, where I can keep an eye on them. Charlie. You made a big mistake. Oh? Such as? They're not gonna give you any votes, Charlie. Those are the Skulls. Adult delinquents. They steal things, Charlie, they smell bad. They use foul language. They have a hobby of wrecking small towns. They've already wrecked our party. Now you've got to get them out of here, right now. Royce, you're going to give yourself an ulcer. Now, look here, Charlie. Page 15, paragraph 12, rider zero. This is police business, Royce. I know what I am doing. Those people are riot potential. I don't think I know what you're talking about. You want me to rile those kids up? Give them a reason to go crazy and start trouble? If not here, then five miles down the road? They promised. Promised? You can't talk to them, Charlie. They are animals. They've had their warning. They'll keep their place. I know my job, Royce. Of course you do, Charlie. And you're going to do everything you can to keep it. -Thanks for the ride. -That was nothing. Come on down to the beach party and I'll show you some real tricks. Oh, party. [LAUGHING] -[CHEERING] -[SURFER ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] [GIRL SCREAMING] [CLAMORING] [CHUCKLES] We could go into town. Are we going to fix the Man? Cody? Cody, tell them. They don't know, Cody. Tell them you ain't going to keep no promise to no Man, Cody. Leroy, forget it. Cody. We go into town... And we're going to get all the nice, safe people out of their safe houses and we're going to ride our scooters and we're going to have a party and we're going to show 'em what beautiful people do, Cody. Cody, I love you! Cody! [TIN CAN CLANGING] Stolen. Cody! [GRUNTS] [HECKLING] You shut your mouth. Cody? Are we really going to stay in Hole-in-the-Wall? Forever. You mean we won't be going back at all? No. Why not? There's nothing out there for us. I've got things there. No cops and... No Man in Hole-in-the-Wall. Yeah, if there's no cops, you can bet there's no connections. Where are you going to score? I will work that out somehow. The idea is to... Idea is to get there. Cody, there won't be anything at Hole-in-the-Wall. There's no place that's got good things that hasn't got cops. -Cool. -It's true. Ain't true. Remember the... [CHUCKLES] Remember the time on that big run up to Patagonia? We had fun there, didn't we? Yeah, that was great. I couldn't stay there very long. It's too quiet. I'd go crazy. You'll dig it. Well, I dig being with you. But they won't dig it. Well, they're gonna now. Oh, my God. Honey, they're Skulls. If there's one thing they can't stand and you can't stand, it's being glued down. We want to roll, and you want us to sit around like a bunch of old folks. Hey, what do you think this is all for, anyway? Hey. Want to hear a ghost story? EVERYONE: Yeah. Well, it seems that there was this motorcycle cop. And he was goofing down the freeway, one night. One foggy night when he hears a mysterious voice saying... "Hey, man, what's happening?" And that cop draw up as tight as a bullet in flight time and he say, "Who that?" EVERYONE: Who that? And the mysterious voice say, "I am the ghost of Rinker the Stinker." [LAUGHING] "I used to be a Skull, don't you remember? "You snuffed me, "you dirty, rotten, beady-eyed, "cold-blooded deadhead." And the cop say, "I didn't mean it. It was an accident, Rinker the Stinker. "Honest it was." And the ghost of Rinker the Stinker say, "Hey, man, you know I was clean. "I was putting along on my scooter, minding my own business, "when you nailed me with the 155 millimeter anti-aircraft cannon! "And now I've come back to haunt your empty soul." [HOWLING] And the cop say, "Oh, please, Mr. Rinker the Stinker, I didn't know you was clean. "I saw you coming out of that liquor store with a package in your hand "and I seen you was wearing your colors. "And I could smell you from half a block away. "And I just knew that you had robbed that joint." Amen! The nose is the best part of a cop. "Well, according to my instructions, it was to shoot first "and wonder about it later. "I've done my duty, "so it wasn't my fault, Rinker the Stinker." Go haunt City Hall! [YELLING] [ALL LAUGHING] It's you! You're the one. What? The Ouija board don't lie. You're the father of my child to be. It's you. -Oh, my. -It is. What are you, some kind of a nut? It's you. Ain't you cold? Getting warm. Come on, crawl in here with me. You'll warm up fast. I know you guys. [LAUGHING] That's what you think. Hey, hand me a beer, huh? Oh. That's how I used to pinch earrings from pierced ears, remember? Can I have a beer too, please? [LAUGHING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] -Heh. -Tonight. -For sure. -Yeah, yeah. Did I ever tell you guys about the time I drowned a lady traffic officer in a barrel of brew? [EVERYONE LAUGHING] We've heard it. We've heard it. Is this all you guys do, is race around, raise hell and have fun? -Yeah. -Almost all the time, we do. Except when we're quailing, of course. You do a lot of quail hunting? Most all the time. Dirty legs. [ALL CHORTLING] Ain't you scared to be down here among all these wild men, little girl? I'm not so little. That's right. You ain't. [WHOOPING] [LAUGHING] Hey, when was the last time you went quail hunting, big boy? Talking to me? Uh, let's see, uh... Thursday. No, no, no. It was Friday. Well, anyhow, here, see. We takes this here quails, see? -Oh, here. -What's that? What's good. Good. [CHUCKLES] -Good what? -[LAUGHING] This here, man. This here is the finest blend of Mexican and domestic grass. Guaranteed to bend your brain. [COUGHING] [ALL LAUGHING] -[MUSIC PLAYING] -[CHUCKLING] All right. All right. We know Charlie Henderson's got a good head on his shoulder. And he's been a pretty good sheriff. Now I think we all agree on that, don't we? -Yeah. -Shut that thing off. Anyway. -[MUSIC STOPS] -He said that he handled this Skull business in the correct manner. Well, maybe he has. Maybe he's right. And we'd be foolish to provoke these second-generation Okies. I don't quarrel with that. But I do quarrel with passivity in the face of that danger out there. Well my wife is setting up in the orchard right now with a shotgun. Good. Now I want to play fair with Charlie. But remember. We've all been friends a long time. And we've got to live with each other when this is over. Well, the thing is to get it over with right now. Right! But we shouldn't interfere to the point where we might generate some unfortunate incident. But we should be prepared. I'm sure Charlie can take care of this just beautifully, but we're still out on a pretty long limb. Okay, I'll get the bowling league together then. We'll play poker here all night. How's that sound? Fine. Fine. [MUFFLED EXCLAIMING] No! [SOFTLY] No. No. Tell me about the quail hunting. [CHUCKLES] Well you take one old quail, see? And you get her good and stoned. -[GIGGLES] -Then you beat on her with a club till she's soft and ripe. -[GIGGLES] -And then you tie her to an anthill. And then you strip off all her clothes. [LAUGHING MANIACALLY] [HOWLING] Ah! [GRUNTING] [SCREAMING HYSTERICALLY] Let her go! Let her go! She'll bring the heat on us, sure as hell! Cool it! Cool it! [LAUGHS] Don't knock down too much, Charlie. You may need your wits later on. I'm a shoe-in. [SOBBING AND PANTING] [THUDDING] [SOBBING] Frank. Come on. Nice going, Charlie! Chapter nine, page 15. Paragraph zero, rider zero! You're finished, Charlie! [PANTING] Did they rape you? No, they didn't. They might as well have! They've done it before. And they'll do it again. But they didn't. Charlie would use that as a technicality. We've got no more time for technicalities. [SIREN WAILING] What's up, Sheriff? Would did you do to that girl? Nothing. We didn't do anything. We'll see what she has to say about that. It doesn't matter what she says. Don't bet your life on it! Oh, look, we, uh, put her on a little bit and we teased her, but... Nobody laid a finger on that babe. That's right, Sheriff, nothing happened. If you're gonna lock up one of us for rape, you've gotta lock up the whole bunch! Your word lasted about two hours but mine is a little more durable. I'm holding you. Come here! Now the rest of you, get going and keep going! I hear of any of you in this area again I will hunt you down like a pack of rabid dogs. Take off. Move! You really gonna let them go? What do you want to do? Build a concentration camp? Tail them to the city limits. Come on. You let 'em go. They rape a girl and you let 'em go. You made another big mistake, Charlie. Chase them but for God's sake don't catch them. Roy. How fast can you get to Pritchard? Like the wind. Well get the Stompers and tell them they're in for a rumble. Bye, bye. [BIKE ENGINE ROARING] Now, we got to be ready with a plan by the time they get back here. Got any ideas? Sure. How do you feel, honey? All right. Fell like telling me what happened? They just kind of scared me. They teased me and made fun of me and got me a little high. That's all. But you talked to the mayor. He said you'd been hurt. No. Thanks, honey. -May I go? -Yes, get some sleep. Thank you, Sheriff. Thanks, Charlie. There was no rape, you knew that. Don't make another mistake, Charlie. Just what are you trying to do? Look, Charlie, that girl was raped. Who said so? I said so. The point is we were trying to protect our community. Now that was supposed to be your job. There's an election in two weeks and everybody knows what happened. I hope you're not about to make another speech. What are you doing now? What do you think? I'm letting him go. Oh? Are you always so gracious to felons? Just allow them to walk out without a trial? Just what did happen, Royce? Suppose you tell me. Regardless of what laws may or may not have been broken, we have been terrorized and brutalized. Now your job, your real job is not to interpret a set of books. Which nobody bothers to read anyway. It's to make us feel safe and comfortable in our own beds at night. On your feet. Come on. Here's your keys. Now get out. If I ever see any one of you in this town again, I'll see to it that you're put away for 20 years. Don't worry. I wouldn't come back to this burg if you handed it to me. [BIKE ENGINE RUMBLING] Bucky. Hey, somebody bailed our president out. -Huh? -Hey. Cody! [LAUGHTER] Cody. [LAUGHS] Cody! -Buddy. -Cody. ALL: Cody, Cody. Cody, Cody. Cody, you made it. All right. All right. CODY: Are we ready to roll? Yeah. And we got the plan down pat. And what's this plan? Billy's got a righteous idea. Oh yeah? What's this righteous idea? You have a righteous idea? What is a righteous idea? All right, you guys go finish getting ready, huh? We're gonna go back into that town and take that place apart. -How about that, huh? -Haha, yeah! Now hear this! We're not going back to any place we've been before. We're going to Hole-in-the-Wall. We've got a score to settle. I'll keep score around here, all right, Gage? Cody. Cody, come here. Come here a second. -Hey, Billy, what is this? -Aw, come on. Didn't you hear me? Let's go. Cody, they're bugged. I mean they're really bugged. To tell you the truth, I'm pretty bugged myself. If we go into that town, we're really gonna get busted. It's too late, they already took a vote. Yeah, well I wasn't here. We'll take another vote. Hey, what is with you, man? These guys ain't gonna listen to no jazz about no holes in the wall. They want it even. Yeah, what do you want, snotnose? What do you want? Hey, wait! The main thing is that they kicked us out of the town for raping a girl we didn't even rape! That's right. I never heard the Skulls taking that from nobody! -I don't believe you. -Billy. Go off somewhere, will you? [SHOUTS] Move! Cody, listen. I'm gonna level with ya. The guys have got their blood up. They like Billy's plan. And if you take a vote, you're gonna lose, man. And if you lose this one, you might as well go off to Hole-in-the-Wall by yourself. Joel, we're not strong enough to go into that town. Oh, yes we are, Cody. Come here, I wanna show you something. -Come here. -[SNICKERING] It's right down the road here. -Hey, Cody. -Hey, man. [CHUCKLES] How do you like that for reinforcements, Cody? 200 Stompers, baby. Hey, man, what's happening? We've got some, uh, unfinished business in Brookville. When we go in, you let our boys pick out the citizens they need. And all you have to do is stand guard and keep a lid on the town until we get done. We was hoping for some razzle dazzle. Razzle dazzle? That's right, man, razzle dazzle. Okay. Razzle dazzle. [ENGINES ROARING] [ENGINE STARTING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] [DOOR OPENING] -Fellas -Easy baby. -Fellas. -Atta boy. Fellas. Don't! [BIKE ENGINES ROARING] [MUFFLED YELL] [GLASS SHATTERING] BILLY: Hey, hey, hey, Sheriff. Truce, man. Now you boys are really in for it. You're all under arrest. All 200 of us, Sheriff? 'Cause that's what we got, man. There's 200 of us in this town right now. Now if you wanna be smart, I suggest you dump all the hardware. I said dump it! Do what he says. There you go, babe. No problems, see. Everybody's happy. [GRUNTS] MAN: Get them up. Hey. Hey! I didn't give you any orders to beat up the Sheriff. Hey, I'll tell you what. Why don't you go to hell, huh? Take him over to the big steel, let's go. [BIKE ENGINES RUMBLING] Billy boy, we have the situation under control. You said it. Now all I want you to do is keep your eye on the Stompers. See that they don't start anything. Why me, man? 'Cause you're a bright boy, Billy boy. [LAUGHS] Right? Hey, look, I can't guarantee... No. Right, right, right. Now look. You're a bright boy. You've got a cool head. And you know how to handle men. -I still can't... -Right, right. Now listen, you make damn sure that they sit still and do nothing unless I send word that we're in trouble. Right? -Right? -Hey, right. Right. -Right. Right. -Right. [JUKEBOX MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC STOPS] All right. We don't have much time. I want you all to be quiet. Nobody speak out of turn. Now what we're gonna do here is we're gonna give these fine folks a fair trial, just like the one they didn't give us. Joel-the-Mole is gonna be the prosecuting attorney. And uh, these seven fine boys are gonna be the unbiased jury. -Guilty. -Guilty. Call your first witnesses. Chick who was on the beach. Come on up here, honey. Did you get raped last night? All right, don't worry about it. Don't be afraid. Tell him. No, I didn't. Well did you tell anybody that you did? No. You didn't tell him? Or him? No. All right, you two bums. Stand up. Come on then, you heard the man, stand up. Did she tell you that she was raped? Bruno? Bruno will see to it that the witnesses answer. No. No, she didn't. But you pretended that she did. Right? Well we felt it was our duty to protect the citizens... So you did! How do you plead? -We won't plead to you. -CODY: The verdict is guilty. CODY: Has the jury decided on a sentence? Yeah. Take them out and beat 'em raw. CODY: All right. You can't do it, Cody. Overruled, let's go. -Let's go! -Oh, wait a minute. For Christ's sake! You're savages! Oh, wait a minute. [LAUGHS] You boys are digging a deep hole. Maybe. Now you stand up. And you keep right on standing. You know, we came into this burg in a peaceable manner. And all you nice citizens did was to insult us and rough us up and throw us out of here like a pack of mad dogs. Now, don't you think you owe us something for that? You've already taken enough to put you in jail for years. That's right. That's right, we sure have, because you just got to win. No matter how wrong you are, you're right and you just got to win. You say we raped a girl and right away, we're sentenced and convicted. You're not gonna get away with it this time. You say we're guilty of rape? Well I say, we got a rape coming to us. Overruled. Why? That's the way it is. All right, just forget it. Forget it? Hell, ask the jury! The jury says... -Yeah. -Yeah. [SCREAMING] [ALL CLAMORING] [FABRIC TEARING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [WHISTLING] My boys aren't too crazy about playing cops. Yeah. Well that's 'cause we're still in kindergarten, man. We've been offering to let you guys join up with us. What's the big deal? You won't let us keep our colors. Well, you can have a little Skull patch on your butt if you want. Hey, wait a second. Is that invite still open? Any time. Now's the time. The town's all yours, babe. [LAUGHS] Let's make it. Let's burn this town! [BIKE ENGINE STARTING] [WHOOPING] [BIKE ENGINES ROARING] [SCREAMING] [BIKE ENGINE REVVING] [YELLING] Where's Hole-in-the-Wall, anyway? There's no such place. What do you mean there's no such place? It doesn't exist. I made it up. You made it up? Cody, you're the only one that needs a Hole-in-the-Wall. Just like you need Funky, and you need Leroy, and you need all of us to pat you on the back. Just like I need you? Just like you need me! [YELLING AND WHISTLING] [GLASS SHATTERING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [LAUGHING] [SCREAMING] [LAUGHTER] Hey, Cody. Come on, let's go. Where're we going, Cody? We're going to Hole-in-the-Wall, you and me. But I'm having a good time.
