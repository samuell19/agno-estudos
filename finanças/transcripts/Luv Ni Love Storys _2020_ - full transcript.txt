This moment. This, too. Even this one. This as well. Also this. And even this. These are the memorable moments of my life and my love story. What? You want to listen to my love story? Then you must know this Luv. Tumbling and whirling. Suddenly he'd start walking reverse. And then he gets lost on the way. Drifted.. ..and aimless. Luv is like this. "Cute and charming face of my baby Krishna." "Tinkling of his anklets struck every heart." "Adorned with a peacock feather.." "..and flute in his hand." "He's heading towards me with a smile." I will start my love story from this point onwards. From those who explained me the meaning of love. With time, their love for me grew deeper and deeper. Wow! Rice pudding! This is my Lala's favourite. Stop laughing. Not everyone's love grew for me. Let's play doctor game. It's very true. No matter how innocent the love is.. ..it is bound to get cast by evil eyes. Bye. Brother, don't send Luv away from us. Go now. Sister-in-law, don't cry. Our Luv will finish his studies.. ..and come back very soon. So I returned after completing.. ..almost 14 years of exile in boy's hostel.. ..and also completed my hotel management course. To begin with my love story. No, this isn't me. He's my friend Saumitra. That's his name. Remember he boarded the bus just before me? For now, let's keep aside the friendship. And focus on Luv. - Shall we go? - Bye. On that day, I saw her for the first time. Where? At home. Who were you looking at? No one. Shall we go home? You people are welcoming him.. ..as if he has returned from the border. Don't cast evil eyes, brother. My Luv has returned home after many years. Bless you. Where's grandma? Grandma. Grandma. Who's it? Grandma. Are you back? Grandma. Grandma. Yes, tell me. I love you. What do you want? A smile on your face. - So, let's go. - Where? "He wins the heart. In fact, he rules the heart." "No one can read his mind but he reads every mind." "He will make you dance on his tunes." "Using all the tactics of war." Falling in love is his favourite game, no matter if it's heartbreaking. "Either he's possessed by love or there's a chemical imbalance in his brain." "Crazy and insane he is. Becomes gentle at ladies." "Man like Luv is rare in this world." "He's naughty and playful, like the Lord Krishna. He's the apple of everyone's eye." "He teaches the lessons of living and makes everyone dance." "He will show you the world through his eyes." "He's a sweet-talker." "He makes people dance on his tunes." "Happy go lucky and always singing." "Makes everyone around him smile." "He's playboy, a magician you can say." "He's master in bringing hearts together." "He's the ever smiling, ever green." "My Krishna is always found happy." "Luv's Love stories." Bye. Is there no one at home? By the way, you seem to be the new cook here. Yes. Take this. Tell aunt that Mishti has given this. Salt is very less. Have you cooked this? - Yes. Wait a minute. How dare you taste the dish meant for the family members? Moreover you're finding faults in it. It won't taste bad with chutney. Haven't you made chutney with this? Chutney. Yes. Put some ginger in coriander chutney. And lemon will enhance the flavour. - Sweetu. - She doesn't know. Grandma. - Even she is not good at it. Aunt. - I will teach you. Aunt. Even I can teach you to make chutney. Come, dear. Tell me. Aunt, your new servant is very unmannerly. Hold on. He's my son. He has recently returned from Mumbai. I am sorry. Actually, I've never seen a man working in this house. - So, I thought.. - It's okay, he's my brother. And he's unique. He loves to cook for us. Isn't it cute? Hi. Mishti. Luv. - I am Luv. My name is Luv. - Enough. She understood. Is it less? No way. Here it is. Freshly baked cookies. Homemade. Nice. - Thanks. But I don't like to eat sweets. - Oh. So, you tell him what you want to eat. My brother can make everything. Pizza. Pizza? Okay, brother will make pizza. You.. Good clutter. Thin crust. Olives, jalapenoes, Paneer. With extra baby corn. Sun dried tomatoes with extra cheese. And.. Not more than 500 calories. Okay. Okay, so I will wait. Mr. cute cook. Mishti, when did you come? Just a while ago. And I am going now. - Bye. - Bye. Strange. Aunt. - I am also going. - Huh?! Bye. What's wrong with him? Extend your leg. Place it here. And keep your leg straight. At this age, we should go to the temple in the morning. Where as you brought us here. People will laugh on us. Nobody will laugh. And there's no age to remain fit. Filmy heroines keep themselves fit like this. We don't want to be a heroine. Daughter-in-law, talk about yourself only. Listen to her. Yes, sister-in-law. Talk about yourself. I'm still a heroine for Luv. Right, Luv? Okay, now no more excuses. Come on, start. Come on. 1.. 2.. Continue. 4.. 5.. Great. You've brought back their youth within 24 hours. Most of the women lose their youth.. ..because they've no reason to be young. If you show little love and care.. ..any woman can bring back her youth. Wow! I can give you a noble prize for this. This is the problem. If no one values you, you feel sorry. But if someone cares, you'd just thank him. Make them feel sorry. If you value yourself, the world will. Coming. She still takes time in getting ready. As if it is her own reception. Say sorry to mom. - Why? Because you taunted on her age. Is it wrong? It is wrong as well as bad. And there's no connection of age with getting ready. If mom will look good, it will add to your impression. From where did you learn all this? - Luv. - Luv? Our neighbour Modi uncle's son. He says that if you show little love and care.. ..to a woman, she can reverse her youth. And those who do not value them.. ..should apologize. So apologize. - Sorry. - Say sorry to mom. Let her come at least. Yes, I am coming. You never give me time to get ready. Now say to her. I am sorry, Sarla. Happy? Both, mother and daughter look good today. Now, let's go. It's getting late. Start the car. Beautiful women are waiting. What's wrong with your dad? It's love. What's the matter? Why are you all tensed? Dad caught Sweetu with her boyfriend.. ..outside the college. So? Why do you cry so much? Come with me. Where are you going, Luv? - Eloping her. - What? Will you help your sister elope? Not only her. I will help all the women of the house elope. Chiki, do you wish to run away? No, I've to finish my homework. Aunt, with whom do you wish to elope? With you. Done. What done? Mom, do you wish to elope with me and aunt? Stop it. Your dad and uncle are still alive. So, make them feel that you're alive. Uncle, when did you last take aunt out? You don't remember, do you? Forget it. When did you last say 'I love you' to her? Do you even know that more than you.. ..another male has said to her 'I love you'? Who's that man? - Me. I love you, aunt. Hey.. it's not important to say everything. Yes, it is. Few things are to be expressed. If not you, somebody else will express. Will it be okay? - I love you, Sudha. - I like it. Stop all this. Will you take the responsibility.. ..if your sister's life is ruined after this love marriage? Grandma. Tell me, who will take the responsibility.. ..if her life is ruined after arranged marriage? Mom, but.. - Hasu. - But, mom. Hasu. Enough is enough. Stop the argument. And fix a meeting with the boy's family. If everything is upto the mark we will.. ..get them married after she completes her graduation. But if we find anything suspicious.. ..in the boy or in his family, then Sweetu must breakup with that guy. Okay? Brother. As my grandma and my God's wish. Can I get to taste these cashew cake? Silver foil. Sugar. And peanuts. No way, sir. We use only cashew nuts. Liar. 'Ras Malai'. - Milk, saffron, dry fruits. - And sugar. Don't act smart. No sweets can be made without sugar. - Yeah. - Where are you? Do this. Now, bring sweets directly.. ..at the time of Sweetu's marriage. - Okay. Sweet cake. Thickened milk, milk and sugar. I know. - Pack it. - Okay. 150 gm only. Wow! 'Gulab Jamun'. Wow! 'Gulab Jamun'. Now happily take your next step. Now happily take your next step. I've never seen her so happy. It's the effect of love. No, it's the effect of Luv. She's lucky. You managed to convince uncle. When the boy is good, he has to agree. Not necessary that every parents would agree. After all, our parents always wish good for us. Just that you should manage to convince them. So, you can convince anybody's parents? Whose parents are to be convinced now? Mine. This is the perfect time. Confess your love for her. What are you saying? Something that you want to say to her. I will say when I wish to. Okay, do as you wish. I don't care. Somebody else will take her away.. ..and you will keep watching. Shut up and get lost now. Mishti, did you order pizza? How do you know, uncle? Just a minute. Your neighbour Hasmukh Modi.. ..is my father. - So I am.. - Oh, yes. Yes. Misthi told me a lot about you. Please, come. Please. Come, sit. Thank you. - Sorry. I thought.. No problem, uncle. I'm habitual now.. Even your daughter misunderstood me as a servant. Oh, I see. I must receive this call. - Yes, please. You both can continue. Chandu, serve tea. Yes, tell me. What's this? Pizza. Woodcutters. Thin crust. With extra baby corn. Olives, jalapenos, sun dried tomatoes.. ..and extra cheese. And not more than 500 calories. So you remembered? It was a special demand, I must fulfill it. Why? I will serve. No sugar please. This.. I wanted to invite uncle for Sweetu's engagement. Okay, I will give it to him. Sweetu's engagement reminds me. That day our conversation remained incomplete. Which conversation? That you will convince my parents. When did I say that? So, say it now. How can I? I should know how the boy is. Imagine he's like you. If he's like me.. ..then it's my responsibility to convince your dad. What if he wouldn't agree? Then I will elope with you. I don't want to hurt my dad and go. Even if I elope with you.. ..your dad will send you with me with a big smile. How will you manage that? - Leave that on me. - Are you sure? Promise. Promise?! Promise. Luv. Thanks. For the pizza. And yes. I want to eat something cooked by you.. ..on my wedding day. It's okay. I can manage. "This heart starts liking somebody." "And the dreams get a new height." "Heart gets stirred up.." ..with the strange emotions." "For a moment I feel you close to me." "The next moment you're away." "This heart yearns for you every moment." "Every moment." "Rock and roll.." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "Like a butterfly." "This heart flies in the sky." "Ignores everyone's advices." "These desires are vagabonding." "Bewildered desires.." "..chant your name all the time." "Ignores everyone's advices." "These desires are vagabonding." "Bewildered desires chant your name all the time." "For a moment I feel you close to me." "The next moment you're away." "This heart loves you every moment." "Every moment." "Rock and roll.." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "Emotions are uncontrolled." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "This heart starts liking somebody." "And the dreams get a new height." "Heart gets stirred up with the strange emotions." "For a moment I feel you close to me." "The next moment you're away." "This heart yearns for you every moment. Every moment." "Rock and roll.." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "Like a butterfly." "This heart flies in the sky." "Rock and roll.." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "Like a butterfly." "This heart flies in the sky." What's this? What? What's this? What are you doing in this pose? Nothing. ""Rock and roll.. This heart.." Luv. I don't understand what's his problem with me. Did you see Mishti? So you're waiting for somebody. It's nothing like that. I haven't seen her from past three days. That's why. Oh, so my brother is dying in separation. Shut up. It's no use talking to you. Look there. Your would-be parents-in-law are here. Concentrate on your fiancé. You idiot. Then I have a party meeting. Hey, uncle and aunt. How are you? Bless you. We are good. Hasn't Misthi come with you? She has gone to her uncle's house. - Yes. Please, come. You please be comfortable. I'm right here. Tell me if you need anything. Sure. Are you upset because Mishti hasn't come? She has gone to her uncle's house. - Her dad said that, right? - Yes. Mishti wouldn't miss Sweetu's engagement for her vacation. - You mean her father is lying? - Yes. It will be switched off. ..is not reachable at the moment. Please, try later. Room exactly above the swimming pool. Mishti. Mishti. Mishti. Mishti. Luv. I was thinking about you. That's why I am here. Take me away from here. I don't want to stay here. Please. Please take me away. Yes, but what has happened? I'm scared. Of what? My dad will get me married with somebody else. How can he do that? He won't agree. But I will convince him. You may try your best but he won't be convinced. He will never accept.. ..his opposition party member's son as his son-in-law. Who? Prem's father is ruling party's candidate. And dad feels that he's losing his daughter along with the election. He will never let us get married. Never. Prem? My boy friend. I had told you. He's just like you. He loves me a lot. I will die if I won't marry him. Please. Please, help me. Please. You had promised to convince my dad. Please. Please, Luv. I can't live without him. I can't live without him. That day I understood that you shouldn't promise.. ..anybody in excitement. To marry somebody else she wants to elope with you. And that too with her parents' blessings. They will give her a good beating. Concentrate on your homework. Or else you will get a good beating. What will you do now? I will fulfill the promise I had given to her. So don't you love her now? I do. Then why do you let her elope with somebody else? Because I love her. Brother, you are making a full filmy story. You will unite her with her love. She will realize your love and she will come back to you. It's nothing like that. He won't confess his love for her. And she will never realize. Will you please keep quiet? Or else you will get a good beating now. What do you think? I think I should talk to uncle. I may be able to convince him. Do you know what you're talking and to whom? I know, uncle. But I have no other option. If you refuse then I will be forced to help her elope. Final decision will be yours. There's nothing like decision in this. I'll never change my words. No, uncle. Don't say that. Why not? Even I'd agree with him. Yes, but.. I'm in the opposition party but my power is none less than the ruling party. If you don't believe you can go ahead and help her elope. Now that both of you have given the permission.. ..she wouldn't mind eloping. Stand straight. Hey, Luv. You got married so quickly? Actually, I was waiting for your permission. You agreed in the morning so I got married in the evening. And came to seek your blessings. Enough. - Come inside. Come. Thank you, uncle. Thank you very much. You've done a lot for me, uncle. - Hey, Luv. - Aunt. Uncle, both of you are really important for me. Come, I want to show you something. - What? - What do you see there? Golf course. Of course. Very nice. Of course, it is golf course. - What do you see behind it? - Where? Behind. Can you see those pillars? Of what? Of my hopes. - Is your wife's name Asha? - No, it's Bipasha. Bipasha? Show me her face. Naughty. Uncle, you're very naughty. But she won't show you her face. Why? Because it's bad omen to see her face on the wedding night. Even I haven't seen her. How's that possible? Hello, uncle. Hello, aunt. Hey, Sweetu. When did you come? With brother. What? She's always with me. - Always. We are together. Because I had to take sister-in-law secretly.. ..brother called me to come. - Nice. Never mind. Sweetu, this is your house. - Yes. And yes, you. Don't worry. If there's any problem then I am there. My doors are always open for you and Luv. Of course, uncle. I know this, uncle. Thank you very much. Just a minute. Take his blessings. Oh. Be happy. May God bless you. Keep smiling like this! Thanks. That day, I believed that God helps fulfill the promises.. ..given in selfless love. There's no one here. Come soon. - Yes, just reaching. Hey.. hey.. Prem! Yes. He's wearing specks. Is there any sunlight? No, it's my style. - Oh. Who do you see there? Okay. Okay. Hi! Congratulations! Thanks. Take care of her. - "Ignores everyone's advices." - Thanks. "These desires are vagabonding." - "Bewildered desires.." - That's for you. "..chant your name all the time." "Ignores everyone's advices." "These desires are vagabonding." "Bewildered desires.." "..chant your name all the time." "For a moment I feel you close to me." "The next moment you're away." "This heart yearns for you every moment." "Every moment." I thought she will come back.. ..and your love story will complete. Who would explain my sister.. ..that like the films, most of the love stories remain imaginary. Whereas reality is totally different. Mishit has eloped. Luv! 'I'll never change my words.' 'Why not? Even I'd agree with him.' In the morning, you took my permission.. ..to help elope my daughter. And in the evening, you took away my daughter.. ..along with my blessings. That too for somebody else? Why? I will reply to all your questions. But you please accept them first. Either you're mad or you want to make me mad. The pistol is right in front of you. You're telling me to accept them. Because it is in your interest. How? Now, see. If both the families will accept them.. ..you both will be politically a strong family. And if Prem's family wouldn't accept them.. ..but you would.. then you will emerge as a good leader and a father. With the excuse of my politics.. ..you want to clear all the obstacles of their path. What could be the reason behind it? Love. What? Prem. Mishti loves Prem. I had promised to help her. Mishti never wanted to elope and get married. And she hasn't.. actually.. But she can do it if she wants. So, now you decide what you should do next. Final decision will be yours. That night Misthi and Prem had stayed at my home. When I met Prem for the first time.. ..I realized that even he didn't wish to hurt his father and get married. He's also like me a little bit. After all, our parents always wish good for us. My plan was successful. Uncle accepted Prem and Mishti.. ..by giving them blessings. And.. How's the food? - Delicious. I know. Luv has cooked it. I will just come. Did you cook today? So you remembered? It was a special demand. I had to fulfill it. That was just a joke. You've already done a lot. Then why did you do all this? Never ever ask this question to yourself. Wish you a happy married life. I fulfilled all my promises given in one sided love.. ..and headed to Mumbai. Mumbai. The fastest city of India. People are fast and so are the locals. Here the business is fast. And so are the traditions. The only thing slow over here is the traffic. And the fastest of all is the relationship here. It ends before it starts. And before the second one starts, the first one ends. Hi. Good evening, sir. Would you like to take anything? Two cups of coffee please. I miss him a lot. But I don't understand how to say to him. Give me your phone. Two cups of coffee please. Don't know why he did that with me. Sorry. Two cups of coffee please. My ex boyfriend wants to return to me. Ex? - Second one. Nice. Two cups of coffee please. I want to have a... Cancel. Two cups of coffee please. I've no boyfriend at all. Whom I can miss and cry. Don't worry. I am there. Check and mate. Excuse me, sir. May I? Yes, please. Hello, do you have any ex girlfriend? If yes, tell him. He's master in setting. He will bring her back. Only in Rs.2000. You're good at it. Run this as a business. Can't guarantee about girls but you will definitely make money. Stop your nonsense. Whatever is in my luck, I will get it automatically. Yes, it will run to you. - Brother. - Yes. Pack half a kilo of cabbage and tomatoes. Okay, madam. And pack good quality. - Yes. She told you to pack good quality. Then why do you pack this? Actually, it's yesterday's veggies left. So what? - What's my bill? - Rs.150. This is Rs.200. Pack this also for me. Hey. Hi. I didn't even get a chance to thank you. - Thanks. - That's okay. But I failed to understand why you bought these rotten tomatoes? He'd have given it to somebody else otherwise. Nice. Is he going up again? So, that's my place. Neighbours. Hey, coffee. Say yes, say no.. say no.. say no.. say no.. Tea? Sorry, it's a bit messy. Make yourself comfortable, okay? - That's okay. So what about your family? Delhi. And what about yours? My last name is Modi. What? Are you Luv Modi? Great. Nice name. Do you know Gujarati? - Yes. I do. Dad is Ashok Gupta and mom is Neha Soni. Mom is from Ahmedabad so I know Gujarati. - Your tea. - Thanks. And what do you do? Well, I came to Mumbai with a dream of becoming a filmmaker. But right now there's struggle in the wedding photography as well. I hope you don't mind. Cute. Struggler has such a huge house? My dad is a builder and this is his investment property. So, yeah. But I pay rent okay? What are you doing? Making salad. This isn't called salad but the massacre of.. ..carrot, cucumber and tomatoes. Okay, I don't know that you're so sentimental.. ..about carrots, cucumber and tomatoes. I'm a professional chef. - What? Yeah. Seriously? I think let me make some Tuscan panzanella for you. No, I'm good with the salad. That's an Italian salad. Thanks. Here's your Tuscan panzanella, ma'am. Thank you. How's it? It's very bland. No, I mean it wouldn't taste this bland with chutney. Haven't you made chutney? 'It won't taste bad with chutney.' 'Haven't you made chutney?' What happened? Indeed it is tasty but I mean.. I don't know.. Maybe, I.. No, actually this doesn't come with chutney. But if you want, I can make it. Do you have a mixer? How much? Sir, it's 99,999. 999? Pack it. - But, sir. Mixer. Okay. Okay. Oh my God! Just a minute. How's it? It's damn good. Nice. Luv. Whoever will marry you will be very lucky. Why? She will have no tension of cooking or cleaning. What the hell! I mean you're also good looking. It's like.. you're a complete package, you know. Mr. Perfect. Really? Are you pulling my leg? No, seriously. Look, if we upload your video in which you're cooking.. ..I bet thousands of girls will get mad on you. Hey, that's not a bad idea. - What? No. Yes. No. - Yes. I won't do it. Today we learnt Mexican handvo. If you liked this video, like it share it.. ..and subscribe our channel. Yes, subscribe it. And don't forget to mention how you liked the video. Thank you for watching Luv in Sona show. Bye. How many views? 1.5 million. Really? Read the comments. She's the only one blabbering. She doesn't allow the poor guy say anything. Where is this written? - Nowhere. Let me read. Luv, you're very yummy. Why did you delete it? Why? Did you like the comment? It's a family channel. Such comments won't look good. Let me read. You guys are a great couple. You look great. Good together. What are you writing? That we are not a couple. But why? Give them a chance to gossip. At least they are not wrong. We look great together. Hello. Wait a minute. What are you saying? Yes. Yes. Maybe the most difficult situation in love.. ..is the friendship that changes. Excitement or emotions. Confidence of confusion. Everything doubles. Maybe that's why when you fall in love with a friend.. ..that situation becomes more special. You feel you're friends. You never realize when you fell in love. And then one day. You don't get one day leave to spend with your grandma. But you can go out with friends for many days. It's not that, grandma. It's her best friend's sister's marriage. She has no budget to take many people. Then take money from me. She won't borrow money from you. Because she wants to take you along. It's nothing like that, Grandma. Luv. Do you know your problem? What is it? You always bite nails. Remove.. remove your hand from your mouth. What do you mean? This time confess your love. Don't just keep your feelings within. - Luv. We will miss the bus. Let's go. Yes, grandma. Bye. "Life is little sweet and sour in your company." "It comes with few soothing moments as well." "I wish this journey.." "..would never end." "I wish this path.." "..takes me to you." "Warn the destination to never show up on this path." "My destination is with me on this path." "O wind.." "..blow.." "..slowly." "My dreams are flying high in the sky." "My tender dreams.." "..are flying in the sky." "O wind.." "..blow.." "..slowly." "Few days and nights are spared for you." "Few are my emotions laid on your path." "I wish this journey.." "..would never end." "I wish this path.." "..takes me to you." "Warn the destination.." "..to never show up on this path." "My destination is with me on this path." What are you doing, man? Do it carefully. We want everything perfect. Just check. It doesn't look good. See for yourself. Do it properly. I will have to do everything. Anjali. So you are here. I've to. How can I avoid attending my client's marriage? Client? So, photographer madam. Get on to work. I am going. Wait a minute. - I never talk to the photographer. I will not click good picture of yours. I hate you. But I love you. Hi, Sonam. Hi, Ishika. Is he your boyfriend? Listen, it's none of your business. Stay away from him. Why? Did you forget? Our college business is yet to be settled. Why don't you get it, Ishika? It was your boyfriend's mistake. He was just a friend for me. Yeah, right. What do you mean? See this. Your pink bag suits on me. Oh, you're carrying her bag?! How sweet! - That I am. - By the way, hi! I am Ishika. You can call me Ishu. Luv. - Huh?! My name is Luv. You can call me Luv. If you're done with the introduction, shall we go inside? Let's go. - Go. Okay. What a cutie pie! Watch it! Luv! I'm loving it. Thank you. Who was she? Why? Aren't you satisfied introducing yourself? She seems to be a very good friend of yours. Oh, so you liked my friend? I never said that. Can I please get my keys? Your ids please. Yeah. Show your id. Thank you. Sign please. You weren't leaving her hand. It was just an introduction. Let me warn you keep away from her. Why? Can I get my keys please? Here's your key. - Thank you. Can I please get my ids? - And your ids. Thank you. Let's go. My room? - It's single room. Single? What do you mean? I mean we are sharing a room. Do you mind? No, but won't it look odd? Odd? When you spend the entire day at my house.. ..don't you find it odd? About the hotel room, it's a different matter. You're right. It's a different matter. But we are here for a work. So get to work. She's just joking. It's okay. Cute photographs! See.. Wow! - I know. Nice, aren't they? - You've clicked them, right? - So? What's this? Is this a gift for me? Oh my God, Luv! I can't believe this. It's my favourite, Baby. Thank you so much. I love it. But, Luv. You've already done so much for me. This wasn't needed. I love you. I love you, Sonam. What?! No.. No, not again. What? What do you mean, Luv? How can you do this? Get up. What?! When?! How?! But I was.. What.. you what? What.. you know what? I thought you're different than others. You will be different. But.. But you turned out just the same. You're the same as others. You know what? You've ruined everything between us. Everything. "O wind, blow slowly." What happened? Why are you so furious? Leave it. You know what? All the boys are same. First they befriend you, then they become your best friend. Once the girl gets emotional, they want to be her boyfriend. I don't know what is their problem. Can't a boy and a girl be friends? But no. They want to be the boyfriends only. And if we reject them.. ..they will continue to call up and torture us. See, again. He has given me seven calls since this morning. I.. How many times were you calling me up every day? Where are you, Luv? What are you doing? When will you come? What's your program in the evening? The only difference is that I used to receive your calls. What did she say? First a friend then the best friend and then a boy friend. Ask her, did I come to befriend her first? I.. She wants to share everything with me first. She wants to call me up every half an hour. She wants to share a room with me. Want to click pictures with me like that of a couple. And if a girl comes little closer.. ..she wants to feel possessive. But if the boy starts feeling for her.. Luv, what are you.. - Then what are you thinking of? Why do you say this? Because we are idiots. What did you say? I made seven calls. I had given you nine calls. Just to say sorry. My feelings for you.. It has no meaning. I am sorry. I am sorry, I believed your false talks. But it was nice being friends with you. That day I realized that I was wrong. The most difficult situation is not when the friendship turns into love. But the form of love that changes into friendship. So this was my love story till date. Your story is very interesting. So what did you think about your future? Arrange marriage? Because you couldn't succeed in love.. ..you're opting for arrange marriage, right? It's not that. I just want to settle down. What about love? One can always fall in love after marriage. Will you be able to? I will try. If not anything I will definitely keep her happy. What if she would still leave you? Quite possible that she falls in love with somebody.. ..after marriage. Then what will you do? I will let her go. Really? You can't force anyone to love you. What if your family wouldn't agree? Then I will help her elope. Are you sure? Promise. Then I must marry you. How was the meeting? Did you like the girl? Luv and Preeti will make the best couple.. ..like Ranbir and Deepika. It's Ranveer and Deepika and not Ranbir. Exactly. Son, what's your answer? - I liked the girl. Yes, she's educated and well mannered. And beautiful also. She is working and also responsible. Most importantly her thinking is modern like me. I think we should see few more girls. Really? You're very much interested in seeing girls. No, it's my habit. - What? I mean it's my habit to think and decide. Only after I rejected many girls, I found you. What? You had seen only one girl before her. And she was our distant relative.. ..so your father rejected the proposal. It's not that, mom. It's because I'm bald now. Otherwise, I had many friends in college. Really? What happened with them? Nothing much. One by one they went on rejecting me. Then I realized that my life can't settle.. ..without my parent's help. Anyway, I was destined to marry you. What did you say? I mean I was lucky to get you. - Okay. Shall we come to the point? Yes. - That's right. Son, what do you think about Preeti's reply? Will she say yes? - Speak up. - Yes, son. Speak up. She has already given her consent. That's good. - Wonderful. And what's your opinion? Come on. - Say it. If you all have liked her you can go ahead. Of course, we liked her. We were waiting for your positive reply. Let me inform your dad. Sweeten everyone's mouth. My son will become a broom. Did you think over it, my dear? - What? She is asking your reply. Oh.. no. Come on, don't refuse directly. Think over it and reply. Right. No. Reason of your refusal.. ..is that I didn't like the boy. - But why? - Just like that. Dear, you will have some reasons if you didn't like him. I didn't like him, that's it. What would be the reason, dad? Give her the reason. We know this family from ages. We won't find a better family than this. Right. Mom, am I going to marry the entire family? What do I do with the family if the boy is not suitable? Right. Don't give me false excuses. What's wrong in Luv? Dad, tell her not to irritate me. Okay. Okay. Raseela, we had decided not to force her for marriage. Okay? Don't worry. I will refuse them today. Oh, dad. You're the world's best dad. And you're the world's best daughter you know. Not just a daughter. Even a teacher. Right. Aren't you getting late? - Yes, I am going. Bye, mom. Take your lunch box. - Yes. Bye. - Bye. You've pampered her. Look at me. If she will continue to refuse boys like this.. ..she will remain single all her life. There's something on your cheek. I always doubted that girl. Education is very common. Beautiful but dark at heart. Yes, she's responsible and earning.. ..but maybe she's proud of money. Most importantly her thinking is modern like me. But maybe her desire to be modern.. ..is the reason of her madness. Why do you give me that look? I always told you to see more girls. Just a minute. Why do you curse her for me? I don't want to get married. - Luv. No, son. - Hey. Destiny.. Maybe you're destined to live alone. I mean whoever is made for you.. ..will come to you on her own. Luv. What a timing! How are you? - Where's Prem? He's at the gate. Okay. Okay. Sit down. Good to see you after a long time. What's Prem doing at the gate? He's waiting for me. Actually, he doesn't like to jog. So he comes with me but waits outside. He stays with me all the time. As if I am going to run away. By the way, will you help me if I want to run away again? Ask Prem if he's interested in running away with you again. Come. You ask him personally. Come. What a style! No. It feels hot. Who are you laughing at? Idiot. I'm talking on the phone. Are your eyes normal? No, I'm wearing lenses. Okay. Bad choice, Mishti. Yes, hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. Yes. Okay. Okay. Yes, okay. What's your name? Sonam from Mumbai? Yes, I will tell him. Okay. Luv, you had a call. - Whose call? She was your friend from Mumbai. From Mumbai? Sonam?! - Yes. Actually, your phone was not reachable.. ..so she called on the landline. She has called you to meet. Where? What did she say? The name was quite pretty. Yes, Binori café. - Hello. - Hello. Hello, grandma. - Yes, tell me. Are you sure she told you Binori café? Yes, but possible that I've made a mistake in listening. Okay, I will be home in some time. Excuse me. Can you get me the cheque please? Hi! Hi! Hi! May I? Please. Are you waiting for somebody? Came to see a friend. Why do you lie? You came to see Sonam, right? Hi, this is Sonam. Did you call me here in her name? Yes. - Why? I was just testing. You gave consent for marriage, right? I just came to see her. I can see that. You were just scared of losing the table.. ..so for 8 PM meeting you reached at 7:35PM. And it's your favourite pastime to sit.. ..in front of the door for hours and hours. Right? You know what? Even I liked to pastime like this. Were you spying on me? I was sitting right there. From past one hour. So? I didn't notice. If your feelings are for somebody else.. ..and you marry somebody else. The situation becomes similar. The person is right in front of you, with you.. ..but you fail to notice. These are the feelings and not a switch.. ..you can turn off anytime. I never said that it is a switch. But feelings for one person.. ..and marrying the other. Isn't it wrong? But you already refused. So it's over. I only refused for marriage. What do you mean? I only refused for marriage. So what is your plan? Don't you find me a girlfriend material? I didn't say that. - Why didn't you say that? But you were interested in arrange marriage. Yes, because I never found anyone suitable to fall in love with. So, do you love me? What do you think? Just a minute. What will we tell the family? Did you ask your family before getting into.. ..your so called affairs? Thanks for the offer. But no thanks. I don't want to play such game anymore. I'm tired. I can understand. You just had a heartbreak. So you will feel scared of.. ..getting into a relationship once again. It's okay. Take your time. Think over it. I will wait for you. What happened, son? Are you alright? What is going to happen to me? I see. So, now you've grown up enough.. ..not to share your feelings with your mom. What do I say, mom? Your hairs have turned grey. Why don't you colour it? How long you will wear the same saree again and again? It has turned old. Buy a new one. Shall we go for a movie? Want to have water balls? Shall I make the taskan pan for you.. What was it? Tuscan Panzanella, mom. Exactly. Shall I make it for you? When you do all this, I like it a lot. Because I see a smile on your face while doing all this. And I love to see that smile. But ever since you've returned.. ..you've lost that smile. I think my Luv's smile is lost in Mumbai. Will you do me a favour? Will you bring back my Luv's smile? Don't keep awake. Sleep on time, okay? "O wind,.. ...blow slowly." Which flavour I should take? Mango or.. I've decided. - What? What you said is right. I should give myself a chance. Good. I'm happy for you. Happy for you?! Yes, happy for you. You will get a nice girl in life. My best wishes are with you. Which flavour you want, madam? 'Kala Khatta'. You mean you are not.. - No. Also add raw mango flavour. What do you mean no? No means no. Also add spices. Then why did you call me to meet? When did I call you? That day you called me in Binori café. Oh, I was just testing you. - Why? Thank you. Because I wanted to marry a boy who came to see me. Hey, train. Let's go. Sir, money. Who am I then? This. Ice-candy? - Only ice candy. You didn't get it? Let me explain. What's this? Huh! - Ice candy. - Right. Will you accept the ice candy without sherbet? Look at yourself. Did you meet your half girlfriends like this? Do you think I am just an ice candy? There's logic behind it, isn't it? What do you want exactly? Kala khatta and raw mango with spices. Flavours of life. Raw mango. Kala khatta. With spices. Falvours of life. She wants you to impress her. Don't worry. I am there. How will you help? You never had a girlfriend. You get most of the tips from the singles.. ..to woo a girl. Candle light dinner. Take her for the candle light dinner. She will melt with the melting candles. No.. Long drive. Take her to the long drive. This will reduce the distance between both of you. No. Okay. Dance. Take her to the dancing club. Then she will start... ...thinking about you only. No. Boating. - Boating? Yes, boating. Any girl would get impressed once gone for boating. No. No. No. Why? Why? Why? I can't do all this. Okay. Okay?! Earlier the girls had rejected me in one go. But you're rejecting me every day. Because you're giving me the reason. Did you do all this for your half girlfriends? Just a minute. Stop calling half girlfriend. Otherwise, what? Otherwise, go ahead. Strange. It doesn't make a difference to you. I took you out for candle light dinner, long drive.. ..and also for dance. I'm water phobic. Still I took you for boating. Good. All of this is good. But this isn't you. If you want to love, love like Luv. Why pose like somebody else? What is all this that you always say? Huh?! Actually, I don't understand what you want. Love. Huh. I want Luv. The original Luv. It's okay if I get it. Otherwise, I will take it as my destiny. This girl is mad. Normal girls have left. But this girl.. this girl is after you. Why? On the very first day she said yes. Next day she refused. Third day, she called you by somebody else's name.. ..and proposed you. On the fourth day, she rejected. And now, she's constantly saying no. Because, she wants Luv. Original Luv. Duplicate. What? Chalbaaz. Sita aur Geeta. Karan Arjun. Ram Lakhan. No, they didn't play double role. - My band. My band. - What are you saying? This movie is of the double role. One girl says yes. And the other one rejects. Shut up. It's nothing like that. No?! Then I am sure she's mad. Or else she wants to make me mad. Me.. I don't understand who this girl is? Who? Either you're mad or you want to make me mad. I am. - What? Luv. Luv is also like this. Selfless and innocent. Congrats. You've completely turned mad now. Thanks. Okay. Everybody wants to make me mad. Mad. Most of the people feel that Luv has gone mad. It's not their fault. Love is like that. Unpredictable. It can make you do everything.. ..that you've never predicted or imagined. Sometimes it can make you fall.. ..and sometimes climb the mountains. In love, you find everything abnormal as normal. And you find normal thing abnormal. It can make you forget your identity.. ..as well as remind you. How's it? - Cheesy. But I don't mind. Don't be happy. You've to go through many tests as yet. "I am love struck." "Spreading the fragrance of love around." "This heart breaks all the chains.." "..and runs, demanding unusual things." "You appear in my mirror image." "My dreams have become as big as the sky." "I talk about you even in my dreams." "I chat with myself about you." "My dreams have become as big as the sky." "I talk about you even in my dreams." "I chat with myself about you." "I am love struck." "Spreading the fragrance of love around." "People call me mad." "I've become a part of your life." "Memories become fresh." "Which is full of emotions." "I know my emotions are not with me.." "..yet I feel you close to me." "My dreams have become as big as the sky." "I talk about you even in my dreams." "My dreams have become as big as the sky." "I talk about you even in my dreams." "I chat with myself about you." I love you. I love you. I love you, too. Brother, are you alright? Yes, I am. What's wrong with me? You ask me. You were romancing with the potatoes. You kissed the junior chef John. To food critic Niti you called Preeti. She was hurt. Do you see Preeti everywhere? Enough is enough. Now, I must ask her if she loves me or not. Huh?! Haven't you asked her as yet? No. She didn't say anything and I am scared of confessing. You know my track record. I know. She will refuse. Hey. This time the matter is different okay? Sometimes she makes me feel that I am special. And sometimes she makes me feel.. ..that my presence doesn't make a difference to her. Double role. Shut up. Whether she confesses or not.. ..now I will confess to her. You tell me one thing. Why do you always fall in love? Because I like to fall in love. Why did you suddenly call me today? Mix veg? It's your favourite, right? How did you know? From your nature. - What?! From your facebook timeline. Mom makes this on your every birthday. Right? Mom? Wait a minute. Are you stalking me? This is called homework. And your mom is like my mom. My mom is like your mom. It's same. So you can cook every type of a dish? Almost everything. Except the rice pudding. Rice pudding? Why? Because it's my favourite. So? A research says that when someone is angry.. ..and in off mood, you serve him his favourite dish.. ..and he will come in good mood. So, sometimes when I am in off mood.. ..or angry then.. ..my wife must know the trick of appeasing me. Do you know to make rice pudding.. - No, I don't. No? - No. But you can learn it. Right? We will talk on this after the 25th. Why? What's special on that day? It's my parent's 25th anniversary. Okay. What do I do in that? Appear for the test. One more test? Why? Which test? Separation test. What's this new now? Let's not meet for some days. That's it. But why? Why do you turn my love story into tragic story? It's not tragic. There's logic in it. If you continuously live with somebody.. ..you'd get emotionally attached. But even after separation if your feelings.. ..won't change then it's love. Otherwise, it's just the attachment. What's the need of this test? Why? Are you scared of the failures? Take it. Take the test. Let me see who wins. Your logic or my magic. I won't come to see you. Very nice. I will really not come. Love is not something you feel only when you're together. But love is something that you also feel in separation. You're in total fix. I knew that girls are complicated. But this one's level is totally different. You take two steps towards her.. ..and she's still ahead of you. I don't understand why she's doing this. Whatever it is. I won't go to meet her now. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. Don't cry. I will take you to her. Okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What's the matter? What? Aren't you ashamed of standing.. ..outside my house like the loafers? Loafer? Sister-in-law. - - Huh!? Half. Half sister-in-law. Half sister-in-law?! You've said no. But he said yes. You had told him not to meet. But we are just watching you. Is there any restriction of standing over here on this road? Yes. Standing over here without any work.. ..is definitely restricted. Okay? Okay. Okay. Sister-in-law, you are the.. ..treasure of joy. This heart sings.. Come on, leave now. I don't understand what to do? Continue. Continue. Game is being played. With you. So you also be a player. Player one. Player two. Mario brothers. Cheers. Buy the balloons. Buy balloons. Colourful balloons. Buy balloons. Buy balloons. Buy balloons. Come on, buy balloons. So, now you became a balloon seller? I can be anything for you. Over? No. It's still not over. What? Magic. "My dreams are as big as the sky." "I'd chat with you about you only." "My dreams have turned big." "Even in the dreams I talk about you." "I forget everything and chat with you about you only." Hi! Oh, hello. Hi! - Hi! - Hi! You're here? Can't I come? It's not that but.. you had refused to meet. Did you listen to it? I thought since you won't listen to me.. ..let me listen to you. So I've come to your house to tease you. What? Now the girl will tease the boy barging in his own house. What..what do you mean? Don't get scared. You said you can be anything for me. So? So be fearless. I am not afraid of anyone, okay? Really? Aunt. - Hey.. - Aunt.. aunt.. Listen to me. Listen. - Aunt. Just a minute. Aunt. Who's here, son? How are you, aunt? Oh, it's you. Who's here, daughter-in-law? Oh, you! Why do they react like this? Because you refused to marry Luv. Just a minute. Oh, it's you?! Huh.. That's why I was stopping you. What's the matter, son? Oh, it's you?! Just a minute, aunt. I was just passing by. So my dad told me to invite you all.. ..for his 25th marriage anniversary celebration. That's why I am here. Yes, sure. Please be seated. Daughter-in-law, she will be busy. Let her go. Sister-in-law, give me the photo of that.. ..damn beautiful girl's whose marriage proposal is received for Luv. It's okay, aunt. I'm getting late. I will come later. Never mind. Do come again. - Sure. Wow! Sexy legs! What did she say? Se.. I didn't understand at all. But what's wrong with your hair? What happened? Dye it. And why are you wearing the old saree? Be ready in the evening. We will go out for shopping. But.. Sexy legs. Sexy legs. She has already rejected you. Serve everybody. Preeti. - Yes. Reply me. - For what? Come on. Yes or no. Take this. What's this? - The reply. It's a return gift. What is this? I asked you something and what is your reply? Don't be so impatient. Let the cake get cut and ceremony be over. We will talk after that. Okay? Why did we all come to their function? They are our family friends. Family friends who refused to marry off.. ..their daughter with our son? The food is not at all good. Total middleclass. Don't you dare give them any gift, okay. Yes, of course. Are you back, son? Listen, now that you're here. Get some photos clicked. So that we can use those photos.. ..to fix your alliance somewhere else. What are you saying, mom? You keep quiet. And yes, tell me how you liked the photographer? What are you saying, grandma? Smile please. Hi! Do you know each other? Sonam is here. - Okay. Sonam is here. Okay. Let me tell you that Sonam Gupta is a betrayer. Still, if you wish to talk to her you can go ahead. I don't want to talk to her, okay? What if I want to? Not okay. So now you don't even wish to talk to me? It's nothing like that. - No. Luv, I am sorry. I know I said a lot on that day. I didn't even think.. It's okay. The matter has become old. I wanted to apologize to you, Luv. But.. But you left uninformed. How does it make a difference? Will you not forgive me? I have. Do you miss me? No. Sometimes. I miss you. A lot. Don't you have any feelings for me now? Don't know. - Don't know? - Yeah, I don't know. When I had feelings for you, I had no idea.. ..what was going on in your mind. Now, that I've feelings for somebody else.. ..I've no idea what is going on in her mind. Suddenly, if you would come before me and ask me.. ..what is going on in my mind for you, how would I know? In fact, even I don't know what is going on in my mind. I don't even know that there will be countless functions.. ..going on in the city of Ahmedabad. Then why you had to come here only? I just don't know. Because, this is my uncle's function. Uncle? I had told you that my mom is from Ahmedabad. You remember? Real maternal uncle? Yes. What happened? Look, Luv. I know it is difficult for you. But I am not in a hurry. You can take your time. Think over it. I will wait for your reply. - Luv. Your family is waiting for you over there. So both of you have met each other, right? Nice. By the way, he's my boyfriend. Luv. That's my cousin. Sonam. Shall we go? What happened? Are you stunned to see your half girlfriend? You already knew it, right? Yes. Why didn't you tell me? Love must be tested. Nice. Luv. I was just testing you, Luv. What test? How many more tests you want to take? And which love you wanted to test? One that you've never expressed? Or the one that perhaps doesn't exist? Luv, it's not that. The only thing is that either you don't trust.. ..or you don't love. Love doesn't exist. Luv. Luv, just a minute. Please, listen to me. Tumbling and whirling. Suddenly he'd start walking reverse. And then he gets lost on the way. Drifted.. ..and aimless. Luv is like this. Even my parents have witnesses.. ..such love in these 25 years. But today I want to say something about.. ..my love and not about theirs. I don't know what is love. But suddenly one day.. ..tumbling and whirling. Luv entered in my life. He is like the ocean of love. People yearn to receive love. But he has always yearned to share love. Some people failed to understand him. That's when he lost his confidence. Still.. I understood him very well. I also wanted his love. But unlucky I am. That ocean of love had dried up.. ..before it could reach me. It's not that I haven't troubled him. Sometimes he was put through the test to impress me. And sometimes he was put through the test of.. ..expressing himself. Sometimes he was put through the test.. ..to be with me and tolerate me. And sometimes he was put through the test of.. ..being away from me and yet love me. He went on giving the tests. And I went on testing him. Today, I crossed all the limits. I called his half girlfriend. No, not half.. For him, she was his girlfriend. One more test. That broke him apart once again. But I just want to say to him that he wasn't alone.. ..put through these tests but I was equally passing through it. Even I was scared of getting failed. What will I do if he still have feelings for somebody else? I went on thinking over it and spent many sleepless nights. Then I recalled his words. You can't force anyone to love you. He yearned for my reply. Whereas I had replied him on the very first day. So, today you must reply to me. Like my parents, even I wish to celebrate.. ..my 25th marriage anniversary. Will you celebrate our anniversary with me.. ..in 2044, Luv? Sugar is little less. And it's half cooked. But I don't mind. "My dreams are as big as sky." "I chat with myself about you." So, this was our love story till date. Enough now. How many times will you repeat the same love story? Don't disturb, aunt. What happened after that? Naughty. - Next? What do I say? Leave it. Tell me how's the rice pudding today? Sugar is little more and it's burnt. But now I must manage. - Come on. When will you learn to make proper rice pudding? - I know to cook it well. - Who said that? I always make it. - Come on. Mamma, can't make proper rice pudding. - Come on, tell your dad. How do I make the rice pudding? Fine, taste this once. It's so good. It's nice. You like the burnt taste. Not everyone will. Okay, do you know any one dish.. ..that you can make proper? Yes, I do. What's that? - Rosogulla. What? It's so truly said. Love is just selfless and innocent. "Rock and roll.." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "Like a butterfly." "This heart flies in the sky." "Ignores everyone's advices." "These desires are vagabonding. "Bewildered desires.." "..chant your name all the time." "For a moment I feel you close to me." "The next moment you're away." "This heart loves you every moment." "Every moment." "Rock and roll.." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "Emotions are uncontrolled." "This heart is on rock and roll.." "This heart starts liking somebody." "And the dreams get a new height." "Heart gets stirred up.." "..with the strange emotions." "For a moment I feel you close to me." "The next moment you're away." "This heart yearns for you every moment." "Every moment." Luv's love story. Thank you so much.
