BIG EMOTIONS MAKE FOR GREAT DINNERS A FILM BY MICHEL BERNY Mr. Georges Armand, driving a Citroën estate car with the number plate 4291 YP 75 is urgently requested to return to his home in Paris, as his mother has died. Shit. My mother. Good God, useless car. Useless! Shit! Shit! Shit! Good morning, here's something from Galeries Lafayette. What are you looking at, dumbasses? Bastards! Bastards! Bunch of dumbasses! Old fools! Thanks. And for you? No thanks, I gave up smoking a week ago. Do you fix cars? I had an accident. Yes, on occasion. What happened? My mother died. Oh no! That's a terrible accident! No, don't worry, she died somewhere else. Then I don't understand. It's very simple. I was driving along. Suddenly, what do I see? A guy, 60-70 years old, crossing the road running after a ball. I swerve, I brake, I manage to avoid him and bang, into the pole. An old man? Yes, and then he vanished into the woods. -And your mother? -She wasn't there. -Got any cheese sandwiches? -Ham. -Sausage? Ham? -Ham. COCA-COLA QUENCHES THIRST BEST That's not meant to happen. I know people in high places! I'm well-connected. Well, Mr. Armand. Good day, Mr. Reverson. Not driving this evening? You know, Anne-Marie and Serge are getting married on Saturday. How's the family? I think my mother is dead. Come, come... What happened? I don't know, it was on the radio. On top of that, I had an accident. The car is wrecked. Come. -Dumbass! -Shut your face, you liar. Is that why you're on foot? Don't hold back, go ahead and lick my meat, why don't you? What? I'm not touching your steak. What's a meat delivery man doing on the bus? What the hell... Come, come. I must have picked that up on the metro. I'll come and find out what happened shortly. It pains me. My little girl is bound to interrupt while you're on the phone. Georges! Georges, it's terrible! Calm yourself, my dear. Right, see you later. Paulette, open the door. It's me, Claude. Your husband. Open the door! Open the door! Open it! Why did you close the door? Show me your hands. Go on. You'll end up in jail. Anne-Marie, I've told you not to walk around in your panties. But, Dad... No "buts." Go and get dressed. Really, "but"... -I can smell gas. -No, Dad. -Are you contradicting your father? -No, Dad. Yes, you are. What are you three playing at? Dad can smell gas. -Are you laughing at your father? -No, Dad. Yes, you are. I smell burning outside. Why did you have to wreck the car? -Do you think they'll keep you on? -Be quiet. Show my mother some respect. Shit. Who put flowers in my fish? -Good evening, darling. -Anne-Marie, remove that immediately. Christian, stop that racket. Please don't shout, I beg you. I have a migraine. What was I saying? It affects your mother most of all. Yes, that's very true. Unbelievable! Nothing stays nice in this house. Be nice, Claude. Don't argue with me. Anyway, dinner's ready. What did you just tell the janitor? What about the janitor? What? You know exactly what I mean. This story about moving to Switzerland. Yes, we're going to Switzerland. I met a big shot from there. At the station. He was looking for a sales manager. -At the station? -Yes, indeed. A chocolate factory. Urgent. They're expecting us in Zurich next week. You'll never change. Anyway, there's no talking to you. You should be ashamed. Yelling at me on a day like today. But you're hurt! It's this bloody marker. You must have got some on your skin. Why are we still arguing after 20 years of marriage? We're like everyone else, you know. Would you be upset if I left? Don't talk nonsense. Hello. Who do you want to speak to? Anne-Marie Reverson? Hold on, I'll go and find her. By the way, your brother called. He arrives at the Gare de Lyon at 11 o'clock tomorrow. What are you doing here, Mr. Legrand? Go back up to your apartment. Hello, ma'am. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, if you want. You're crazy. Yeah. No, I'll explain. Showing her ass in a house in mourning, for shame! See you tonight, bye. Goodnight, sir, ma'am. Thanks. Most sales in Europe... It's miserable over there. It was Catherine. We're off to the movies tonight. No. But I'm nearly 18 and I'll be married in two days. And anyway, shit! To become a married adult, you need to eat. That's mean. ...switched off its projectors, while backstage echoed with the din of a rapidly inflating steel industry. The first act already had plenty of surprises because informed sources declared that the big three unions are getting ready for a wild gallop for social rights. In the same spirit, Act II could take place in an industrial and agricultural context dominated by this big drugstore... At the end of the day, we're all family. Keep that in mind. We could try talking. My keys! I was looking for them. I don't understand why you're not happy, marriage is marriage. Even if our neighbor is dead. It's unfortunate, but you're the eldest. As an adult, it's your duty to give up the movies and offer your condolences. Anyway, they have the phone. How did they fall into the soup? Paul, stop. I'll run them under the tap. It's 8:30 p.m., it's already late. Come on, my big girl, don't dwell on it. What is it? Well. Mrs. Armand, what a tragedy! Our condolences. Thank you. Thank you. Come in. These politicos... Sir, we were informed about the tragedy that has struck you and which we share with maximum efficiency. Our reputation starts with our deepest condolences and is based on the quality of our equipment. Very few businesses can boast of offering a final resting place of sufficient permanence and with a touch of elegance that is the hallmark of sincere regret. We alone are able to satisfy the departed and those who mourn her without costs that might exacerbate such painful circumstances. We are so insignificant. Can I offer you a drink? No, really, ma'am. Don't go to any trouble. She was so full of life. How did it happen? A dog. She was trying not to hit a blind woman... Calm yourself, darling. MODERN UNDERTAKERS No thanks, I've given up smoking. So, this big girl's getting married? Yes. The cycle of life. At 11:10 p.m., we'll be bringing you the latest news. In the meantime, sit tight for our regular Thursday encounter with the heroes of our series: The Indestructibles. Today, Episode 15: The Traitor. Well. Mrs. Armand. Talk of the devil... Were you saying nice things? So, is the bride going shopping? Yeah, a final fitting. I need my dress this evening, I've had enough. I had to find a hat. What an idea! Well, it's not that great but I'm already late. I must go. -See you soon. -See you soon. FRENCH RAILWAYS - EXIT Eight down. Dishonest. Oh boy, look at this traffic. Don't, it scares me. So, tomorrow's the big day. It'll be memorable. Look, there's the Eiffel Tower. -Can you see anything, Camille? -No, there's too much traffic. ...depending on the metro, exit number one, on your left. -Alright? -Yes. Alright? How was your journey? -Hey mister, my tip. -Sorry, I've no change. No problem, I have some. It's not urine, it's oil. TRANSEUROPE ENTERTAINMENT AND TOURIST OFFICE Three musicians, three hostesses, plus a compere. That will be me. And 24 meals, without cakes or drinks. Hey! What are you doing? You don't give a damn! Stick your fine. Go on, then. This is going to cost you. It's easy when you have a cup. MODERN UNDERTAKERS There was a dog crossing the road, he was leading an old, blind woman... He's crazy! Stéphane, I won't have time to do everything. Take the metro and fetch the kids from Janine's. Here's a map. Look where you're going, you bastard! Calm down, jerk. Hey! Hey! Don't leave! Don't leave! Help! But.. But help me! In the name of God, don't go! What the hell are you doing? You can't leave me here! Come back! Good God of shit! Bastards! Bastards! The bastards! Bastards! Try this camembert. It's excellent. And it doesn't smell. Open it. See? Did you know I bought a boat? A walnut shell, 12 meters. Twelve cabins. A good building. And it moves. How many knots? I didn't count, they're everywhere. With all the ropes... I'll take you to see it. It's in Joinville. I have a garage there. Just like me. Do you have a boat too? No, a garage, but not in Joinville. But note, that I refuse to drive. Paulette too, but I make her. She's so clumsy. Say what you will, it's nice having a boat. Of course when you have one, people are jealous. -Are you trying to annoy me? -Sorry. -What were you saying? -It doesn't matter. You also have this one at a good price. Yes. Try it, you'll see. You don't expect to meet idiots of that age. Alphonse, what have you done? Nothing at all. This gentleman doesn't know his own strength. But I closed the door gently. -Sir, you saw me. -No. My God! -Oh no! Is anyone hurt? -"Anyone hurt"... Hello, Mr. Armand. By the way, Mr. Armand, this is Alphonse Terrac, my cousin, a man of the countryside. I know my way around the countryside. Driving tractors, cows... Why is my son crying? I want a balloon. A balloon? Come on, son, be a grown-up. You have to train them. I keep a close eye on mine. This reminds me of when I was almost cut in half in '46. I was working in a mirror factory. A clumsy worker was moving a huge mirror, enormous... Stéphane, be kind and take this to the Reversons. It's a mistake. And if you don't mind, you could go and fetch Georges. He was at the barber's. Miss, this must be for you. I've come from across the hall. My sister-in-law said... Actually, I'm her brother. I mean Georges' brother. Thank you. It's kind of you. Sorry, it just comes naturally. Anne-Marie. OK... Well. Listen to that traffic. Anne-Marie, where's your brother? I don't know. So nobody in the family knows where my child has gone. Paulette, is it you making that noise? I'm done in, let's go home. Mr. Paul, don't forget to place my bets. I won't have time tomorrow. Are you still OK for the car? My brother is going to drive it. Yes, you can count on me. Look where you're going, dumbass! But what the-- Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! That's a fine thing. Someone who's just lost his mother... You, my friend, outside. -What's happened now? -Don't worry. Poor Georges! And Pierre hasn't come back. Lazy! It should be lit right down to the bottom. Ah? Ah, yes. Can you hear that? Eh? Here. Here. Keep them, I've given up, but if I don't have them on me, I feel uneasy. Why isn't there any light? We can't see what we're throwing away. Mr. Reverson, my brother Stéphane. A light, perhaps? You know I've quit. It's good, they do pretty bouquets now. Look at those white roses. There's no card with them. The white ones are surely not for us. Mind you, with fashion these days... Fashion or not, the rose is the queen of flowers. Rose or not, you know, me and flowers... So it's a return to the soil, and those sweet, intoxicating aromas. Alphonse, Mr. Georges Armand and his brother have just lost their mother. I'm so sorry... I wasn't aware. Claude, I'm very worried. Paul still isn't back. Mine isn't either. Yours must have led mine astray. Do you think this is a day for watching TV? To the table! Where can the kid be? Hello, yes? Yes, hold on. It's for Anne-Marie Reverson. It's stuck. Sorry, there's a call for you. -Can I do something? -Yes, thanks. What should I do? It's the phone. No, it's the doorbell. I'll take the fuse out. That noise, someone needs to take the fuse out. My God! Even in your sleep, you couldn't be more backward than him. What have you gone and done now, Paulette? Oh my God! Wine everywhere. And my garden peas. And my little collar... I'm an idiot. I know. That's it, the wind has changed. Really? That's great. That's really great. She has a nerve. She's been giggling down the phone for 15 minutes. You don't do that under the same roof as the dead. You know, the upbringing her father gave her won't sort her out. It's not abnormal. When he's not listening to Callas, he scares me. I don't give a damn. My father wouldn't let me. Pierre! Pierre! Oh God, the wind has changed. Christiane, pass me the tape. Stéphane, Simone is in her room. -Simone? -It's Pierre. Oh, the wind has changed. Yes, it's... It's Georges. Goodnight, thanks. Keep going, I'm going to do the kitchen. Pierre. Pierre. Pierre. Paul. Paul. Pierre. Pierre. -I'm worried. -You do realize? With everything that's happening... My husband has gone to look down at the café. Well? I'll go and look up there. And your husband, his mother's death, how did he take it? Oh, you know, he hasn't said much. He's in a bit of a dream. And since he quit smoking, he's been stressed. You don't know mine, he's authoritarian. He works so hard at the ministry. You shouldn't let your kids out at this time of night. He's not in danger, ma'am. He has his beret. Are you looking at the factory smoke? Oh, it's you. It smells bad. Sorry, I mean the factory. You're funny. No, I'm not funny, but I like you. For three years, there have hardly been any birds here. From time to time, we find a dead one on the terrace. I put a scarecrow in my garden to stop them eating my apples. I'd like to have a garden. But you will have one, Miss Anne-Marie. Come and see me with your husband. He doesn't much like the countryside. Whereabouts do you live? In Beaune, but I just work in Beaune. My house is nearby. My husband says you got a boat. I'd be surprised if he were here. We've already looked, Mom. They're not here. Well? Did you know, Mr. Armand, what our offspring was doing? She was smoking and drinking. Don't worry, they're back. Bloody kids, all the same... Tomorrow, sister, you will be called missus. And tomorrow, bye family. Ladies and gentlemen, our programs are over. Have a lovely day and hoping to see you again tomorrow on our first channel. Sorry. Even on your last day, you had to mess up. It's me! On form, cousin? Don't come in. Hello, sir. IFOP is doing a poll. What did I ever do to you? Hello. It's for an IFOP poll. There's nothing to poll here. Poll... poll... Why isn't that coffee going through? Don't touch the filter. Don't touch the bowl. With grandma, the coffee always went through. -This one? -Do you have any herbs? Yes, ma'am. Here. Your package. Here, go and get the wedding cake. I hope it's ready. Don't hold back. Bravo. Give the car a kick while you're at it. -Go on. -But I didn't do anything. Would you like it if I hit your packet? Would you? Hello, Mr. Armand. -My condolences. -Yes, thank you. Don't bother. It's just broken down. A short circuit. Hurry up. They're waiting on you to close the coffin. Is everyone here? The dye wasn't ready, the elevator isn't working. I'm going to change. It's not possible, look at that. I can't. -Georges, everyone's waiting. -Have you seen the state of me? Right, very well. Go and get the children. Sirs... We're going to be late. We already are. You'll leave when we can. Calm down. We might get the wrong cortege. We need to make room, the elevator isn't working. Bastard! Jojo, bring your father's things back immediately. That's it, they've left. After the funeral march, the wedding march. What the hell are they doing? Use the horn, why don't you use the horn? Long live the bride! Stop or we'll have an accident. -It's very dangerous. -No. You know, Alphonse, that's not really done here anymore. That's no reason not to. Alphonse! Look at that traffic. Of course, there aren't enough streets. I did tell Georges I don't know Paris. We've lost them. It's wedding central. Wait, I'll be back in a minute. They can yell but we'll never find them. Do you have any change? Pay me back when you want. WATCH OUT FOR PICKPOCKETS You didn't find it? We nearly gave it to someone else. You're the funny uncle? Yes, I'm one of a kind. -Excuse me a moment. -Yes. What's going on? It's my heel, it's broken. Don't worry. You're going to leave. Come on, calm down. I can't help it. Your dress suits you. Are you happy at least? Of course, Mom. Come on, let's join the others. I don't know how to cope with all these people. I told Georges I'm not used to it. Mr. Paul isn't going to be happy. Where is the Armand family vault, please? The red alley, concession 24, grave 438. Hurry up. They passed by half an hour ago. ...and of Marie-Adèle Lecaire, his wife, residing in Paris 8th arrondissement, 4, Rue du Menhir, and Chantal Ravet, shop assistant born in Bordeaux, Gironde, on 3rd March 1955, residing in Paris 16th, 16 Rue Eugène-Manuel, daughter of Georges Ravet, trader, and Suzanne Ravet, residing in Paris 16th arrondissement, 16 Rue Eugène-Manuel, on questioning, declared that no marriage contract has been made. They declared one after the other that they wished to be wed and we ruled that in the name of the law they are united in marriage in the presence of Jean-Pierre Mayrand, doctor, Rue Sainte-Croix de la Bretonnerie and Claude Guillaume, unemployed, 12 Rue de Fécamp Paris 12th, witnesses. Having read and been invited to read the contract, the spouses and their witnesses signed with us, André Jallut, deputy mayor of Paris 18th arrondissement. Please sit down. Article 212: "The spouses owe each other fidelity, protection, assistance." Article 213... In the name of the law, I declare you united by the bonds of marriage. Please sign the register. -You're only arriving now? -Georges, I told you. What did you tell me? You're ill? Be quiet, they're looking at us. Cousin, I beg you. Oh God, what did I do? I'm going to report this. TAXI STAND It's good and cold. What are your Dutilleuls doing? They'd never have found three cabs. Anyway, the taxis always go to Levallois. You have to change there and it takes time. Yes. Friends, while we wait for the latecomers, we're now going to serve an aperitif electronic-style. Young ladies. There we are. Perfect. Now you will taste your food and drink. Attention, keep looking at the center of the table. Young ladies, music. Don't worry, it's just engineering. There. And go! Young ladies. Marvelous! I hear the elevator. Sorry. Mr. Legrand, you're crazy. You shouldn't have. I don't know what to say. I don't know how to thank you. You're making me blub like a baby. No, stay there. I'll help you. If I'd known, if you'd been able to tell me... I'll place them on her photo. You know, Mr. Legrand, a photo, it's a bit of their living self. It's for you, shame. What a horrible thing! Still, she mustn't have suffered for long. And all these dogs running after bitches, the shame of it! It's disgusting. What an example for the children. My little Dominique, don't look at the dogs. And watch out for blind people. Henriette should never have driven. Everyone gets killed on the roads. A massacre. I always told her, "Henriette, "you can't drive very well. "Take the metro, the train, anything, "but don't touch a steering wheel. You won't make it." But she always went her own way. She was headstrong. So, who was right, eh? -My mother is right. -As always. I wouldn't say it was her fault, but still. It's one of Henriette's tablecloths. Can you break this claw for me, dear Georges? It's a pity to damage the property of the dead. A little respect is called for. We don't have enough respect for the dead. Nor for the living, come to that. My little Dominique, keep a close eye on everyone. I wouldn't want to bury you as well. A gypsy told me that a long time ago: "You'll live to be 100." And my doctor isn't wavering even though he's in Hungary. He told me the same thing: "You will bury them all. "You're as solid as a rock." Don't blame me for being careful. I don't go to excess. I've always insisted on keeping my health for the sake of others. If I wasn't here, you'd soon see the difference, but people are ungrateful. So, have they all forgotten you? Here, have a drink. Sorry, but you're going to kill him. I used to have a few fish myself. Without boasting, I do have some experience. I recall a Pytheas coetarus who died for similar reasons in my arms. Even though I'd done everything to save him. Like the neighbor, she died. Philippe, a little Pastis? Oh really, ma'am! Just ask, that's what we're here for. It's true. There's no choice. What do you want me to do? You're sabotaging my work. You're stopping me from doing my job. In two years, I've never seen anything like it. Never! Funeral faces, and half didn't even show up. Nobody's listening! It's going to change. Trust me. Stop, you lot! We can't hear ourselves. Move, get us out of here. Ever seen me from a plane, Léon? Pouchachi, Pouchacha You want Serge? Leaving Serge From one husband to another Pouchachi, Pouchacha This will bring the couple luck. Pouchachi, Pouchacha... What the hell? ...And the girl who is the pride of the Reversons Pouchachi, Pouchacha It's a Canadian game. Clap louder. Pouchachi, Pouchacha... -Where are you going? -I've things to do. -But no. -But yes, let me go and make a call. We need to let them know we're waiting. Pouchachi, Pouchacha And how does Serge do it? He does it like this Information? I'm trying to contact Mr. Dutilleul. Of course I have his address, miss. And his number, but he isn't home, or I'd have called him. Be reasonable. You don't know where he is? No, it's not a joke. Please remain polite, miss. Hello! Hello! Thank you, Mr. Armand. It's not your fault if your phone's users are impolite. Poor Henriette. Was she chatty on the phone! I couldn't get a word in edgeways and to say what, most of the time? But she was so good. Do you remember, dear Georges, when I used bounce you on my knees? Me on your knees? Yes, my little Georges. Do you remember that, my little Stéphane? Because Henriette didn't look after you properly, it must be said. Her husband had just died and she was having a great time. It's only human. He died in '32. She was young. So, who took care of you all? It was Yvette. -Wasn't it, Albert? -My mother is right. My little Georges, you nearly had my eye out. You're so clumsy, just like your mother. But I have a lucky star, a robust carcass. The cousin's starting to get on my nerves. You know, Yvette... I know, I know she was good and wise with it. She had her head screwed on. Wait, under the Occupation... Say, my little Christiane, your neighbors have no shame. They won't be coming now. Go and change, my treasure. Go now. We're going to miss our train. Put that in your case. You never know. Have you ever seen anything like it? Me? No, never. I've never seen it. It's true, we've never seen it. Well, my little Serge, now you are two. Lend her your arm. She will give it back to you. -Sir... -Call me grandpa, my little Serge. And as for you, my girl, listen to your husband who now replaces me. We shall watch them leave. The wind has changed, you wretch! I hate cats. He has a disease. My little Christiane, look at his back. He's missing fur. And he touched my leg. What am I going to catch now? I've seen many a road. Just like your mother, my little Georges. She really was patient. Of course, there was the incident with the little dog. It was in '38, at the Martins' house. She got the house in the end. God knows what's become of the Martins. But their little dog stayed behind. He barked a lot. And there was that well in the courtyard. You have to understand. I've had enough of your malicious gossip. Anyone would think my mother was scum. Come on, Georges, stop. She's been spitting on my mother for an hour. The day of her funeral. Pay no attention, Yvette. Georges is just a bit gruff. Gruff? I'm going to slap that old hag's face. I won't waste any time. You're as uncivilized as ever, my little Georges. To treat me this way under Henriette's roof... Stéphane, restrain me or I'll make a hit. Come on, Georges. My mother is right. Do you want your peach? Mom, shall we go? No, darling. Let the grown-ups talk. You're going to run out the door! Quieten down, my little Georges. -First, give me back my ring. -What ring? The diamond ring I lent your mother in '45. She was to keep it for a week. I asked for it back 100 times. I know that somebody knows where it is. Old bag! You need to leave! Right now! Don't touch my mother! Don't touch my mother! Get out! And you too! Go, or this'll get heavy! My things! My things! Your things? Your things? Here. See you at my attorney's office, my little Georges. Stéphane, serve some drinks. Goddamit! What is the meanest note in the scale? Well, it's sol. Because... Because the sol makes rino and the Rhino, it's Ross. Philippe, you're nearly as clumsy as me. I find him very funny, this young man. Come in for a moment anyway. Wait, there are late comers. The happy couple has left. This way. Hello and welcome. Party time! Come in ladies, this way. Miss Ant was his neighbor To her he went, 'O you're rich from labor And I've not a cent Lend me food And I vow I'll return it, Though at present I have not a cent. The Ant's not a lender I must confess. She said, "Pray, how passed you the summer "That in winter you are distressed?" "I sang through the summer," Grasshopper said. "So you sang!" sneered the Ant. "Now it's winter, go dance for your bread." ENTRY TO THE BUILDING IS FORBIDDEN Mr. Legrand, you should go out. Look at this beautiful sunshine. You'll be comfortable here. You can get a sun tan. Is this OK? I'll leave you. Come in, Mr. Armand. -I'm not disturbing you? -No. Or I wouldn't have told you to come in. Well, well, you're very organized. Do you think so? Nobody ever said that before. That's as maybe, but I'm telling you that now. Sets like that don't exist anymore. When I was in Indochina, I had the same one. There, I was king. Saigon, the paddy fields, the vahines, the dollars. I had a great job. I was involved in the opium trade. No, not that kind, not drugs but pharmacy products, state-run plantations. I supplied the hospitals. When I was in hospital, I was given opium. It was for my leg, a skiing injury. They did a good job, look. You can't tell. It's good, opium. That's why people can't stop once they've tasted it. But Georges Armand can stop whenever he wants! -I knew music. -Listen! -What? -The music. Listen to the music. It's beautiful, all the same. Be quiet, Armand. You know nothing. You're incapable of describing this music. Don't breathe, don't move. It's a magic wave. You hear? The movement is beginning. Tremble, Armand. That's happiness. You don't understand. Nobody ever understands, you're looking at me as if I were mad. Paulette looks at me the same way. Even my children. Music is I don't know. It's the sunshine in my little civil servant's life. Fifty years of emptiness, of loyal service, a little man without blame, without love, without friends. Claude Reverson, born and died in greyness, silence, alone. At least you have your boats, your memories. I don't really have a boat. I haven't traveled. I just tell everyone stories. It has to be done. I can't help myself. Christiane tells me off about it. Deep down, you're a bit weird too. Me too? People find me weird, I don't know why. I must be weird. No, Mr. Reverson. -Yes. -If you say so. You see? You find me weird too. You even came to my cellar to tell me so. -Mr. Reverson... -I don't blame you for it. Let's remain good neighbors. Let's go back up, Mr. Armand. I hope it wasn't too painful for you? Meh... It was party time at your place. You know, afterwards I asked them for wine. Talking of wine, if you want some Bordeaux, I'm well connected with Château Lafite Rothschild... I do as I please. Subtitling: Hiventy
