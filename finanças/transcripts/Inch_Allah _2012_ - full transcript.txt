Did you go to see your neighbors? Yeah, visited them yesterday with Ava. For seven days, people come by to offer condolences. It's been a long time since the last one. It's constantly in the news here. Mom... you have toothpaste on your chin. Keep thinking it could have been you. Well, it wasn't. Am being a pain? Yes. But you love me? Yes. Is that all you're eating? Mom, gotta go I'll call you later, OK? Bye! Coming. Bye, Mom! - I'm off! - Bye, Ava! See you tonight. - (In Hebrew) Thanks. - Go ahead. (In Arabic) Hello. We're searching the area. Do you want to examine the ultrasound, guys? Show it to them, Chloe. I'm talking to you! Do your job properly. The baby might be armed. Shall introduce you? My baby's named would, after the singer. Let's go, we're done. Hey, little brother. Get back to work! - Bye, sweetie. See you later. - Bye, baby. You dork! Rand, put this upstairs. - He's tiny! - He'll grow up strong. Mom needs a kilo of tomatoes. Come on, Safi! For would. Hello? Oh, it's you! Very well. And how are you? Could please speak to the very Honorable President of Israel? He's screwing? I'll hold on a few seconds till he finishes. He's done? Great! Hello, Mr. Honorable President of Israel. It's me, Youssef. Wanted to tell you that things are shitty here. Here, look! Here! Too bad you can't see us. We're so handsome. Especially me, Youssef. Wait, I'll put someone else on. She wants to know what you're cooking her for supper. Hello. Hello? Hi, it's me. Won't be home tonight, my love Or tomorrow. No, a little dork is hitting on me. Think I'm going to stay. Bye. He hung up. They're firing on the settlement! Come on! No one has claimed responsibility for the attack on the Beit Shomron settlement. We know that the attackers were armed and that they? ed shortly after the attack. Faysal's still not answering. Was anyone killed? The three assailants fired on the settlers, seriously wounding two of them. Seriously! Yum, it's almost ready. The attack on the Beit Shomron settlement is the second terrorist attack to take place in recent weeks. The emergency medical service reports several people were seriously wounded, but their names have not yet been made public. The army is being deployed around Beit Shomron. Controls will be stepped up at the Qalandia checkpoint. Rand, call your brother again. He's not answering. Did you try the printing shop? - It's crazy outside. - Hear about the attack? Of course heard. - Two wounded. - In serious condition! We tried to call you. Several times. - It's burned. - Like it burned. Like the guys who fired on the settlement. Things are gonna get hot! Tomorrow, me and Gaza will do the plastic. Youssef, you're out of luck. Khaled... Hamse and Oulema... you do the rest! Eat, my son. Eat, my son. Hello, Ziad, my love. They fired on the settlement Maybe you saw it on TV. Two wounded. Everyone's here, even the visitor. Hello, Ziad. It's Chloe, Mika's doctor. The other day, she let me listen to his heart. Can you hear it, my love? It's his heart. He can't hear it, Rand. It's amazing, isn't it? Your time is up. It's the next prisoner's turn. Bitch. Darling, the dogs refused my permit request again. But I'll try again. Hope I'll be able to visit you soon. Good night, Ziad. - Mom? - Good night, Ziad. We know your sentencing's coming up. We're thinking of you. The army trucks are outside. She's scared of us. This way! Move it! Do you know any fighters? No. Did you see any weapons around? Guns? Bombs? Didn't see anything. You didn't see any weapons? No, didn't see any weapons. Are you glad the settlement was attacked? You OK? What's going on? Can't talk. I'll see you tonight. The man says he won't show me his papers. Not that he doesn't have them, just that he doesn't want to show them to me. So... try to stay calm, y'know, just explain to him that I'm only doing my job, that after the attack, can't let him through like that. So then, Zach... You know Zach? He asks me if there's a problem. Say no, can handle it. But he doesn't listen. He starts to shout. He went apeshit! He wanted to win. He started to round up all the men. He kept them there, near him... half naked. Didn't say anything. Kept my mouth shut. Hate doing border control. I'd rather be in an office, or anywhere else. Hate checkpoint duty. Quit your job. It's not my job, Chloe. Have no choice. You know very well it's not that simple. You can reach me at the hospital if my mobile's off. Leave the bed, Mariam The settlers fucked in it Did your mother make you deaf? Leave it! Karim, you separate the soft plastic. Hurry up, you bunch of slugs! Guys, come see this! Take a look! No, everything's fine. No, no search today. Can't, Michael. It's packed. No, things are quiet. OK, fine. understand. For how long? Idiot. - Sorry, we're closing. - Why? The clinic is closed. Safi! The martyr is beloved by God! Your blood won't flow in vain! Yes, Mom. I'm just upstairs. Yeah, I'll be down soon. You look worn out. Lack of sleep, that's all. Is anything wrong? It's OK, Mom. No big deal. What time's your date? A bit later. Tell me if these look alright, OK? These ones? Mom... stand back, can't see! Like this? Don't know. Don't you have... You know, the pretty ones... The round ones, bigger than those. - The round ones? - Yeah. The wooden ones? Wait, I'll get them. These ones? Right? Know that look. What's wrong? Those are the ones. You're really pretty, Mom. Yeah? Look at me, Chloe. You always worry for nothing. You don't talk to me. I've got nothing to say. Mom? Just want to see the river. Wait. There. Bring along your swimsuit and sunscreen. It's a great day for the beach. We'll have more weather in an hour. Up next, it's the news. The attack on the Jewish settlement in Beit Shomron is still unclaimed. For several days, the army has been carrying out a vast operation around Ramallah, mainly in the refugee camps where the terrorists might be hiding. You OK? - You're not working today? - I'm listening! In Ashkelon, the municipal council approved construction of a new library... Two wounded and they ransack the camp. Nobody died! Not for lack of trying. A boy dies on the other side, no one says anything. They cover the attack on the colony. That's the news for them. That's their job. A boy crushed by a truck isn't important enough for you Israelis. "Us Israelis?" Two people were seriously wounded. See you tonight? No, have a double shift I'll be back late. Or maybe never, if they try something at the checkpoint. Ava... Here, from Rand. Who? Hey, white girl. You're no better than us in this shit. You couldn't have done anything different, understand? What are you doing? Come on, give me that. Give it to me! - Where you going? - Get in. These ones too. - My friend! - Lmad, what's up? Imad! Come here! Let's go. He's showing off his doctor! How are you? You drive the nicest car in the whole camp! And he pretends not to know us. He's become a tourist guide! His car's shiny, shiny. Couldn't get any shinier. It might be useful to us. It could help us out. It could be very helpful. Have some more tea! See you tomorrow, my friend! - Don't get sick! - Or have a? at! Hi, lmad. OK, you can come over. Bye. Chloe, have to talk to you. Two seconds. What's up? What's this? Couldn't throw them out. Bravo! Did you paste them yourself? - Look, was there... - What the hell are you doing? You can't just do as you please here. I'm a doctor, stay out of it? Exactly, yeah. Chloe's busy! It's Safi's birthday! Rand! There are rules here. You know that. You can't do anything you want. You have to keep a cool head, do your work. His blood was on my shoes. Yeah? Whatsit you do next time? Don't worry. Do you have any more? Throw those in the garbage. What was his name again? Youssef. He was a little dork. A little what? A little punk! Hi there, darling! - Do you have your keys? - Yes. Because you open up after the weekend. - Can give you a lift? - No, I'll walk. - Sure? - Yeah. Chloe! You see that star? The brightest one? It's not a star, in fact. It's an Israeli control tower. They spy on us everywhere. He's Palestinian! He's in the semifinals. - How are you? - Good. - Busy day? - The usual. Do you have ID? Where are you from? Put out your cigarette! Just to the village? No farther? Yes. We'll be back before nightfall. I'll see what can do. I'm trusting you. Good night. - Eight hours. - Yes. No more. Thanks. Are you sure? Don't know where we are. It's all in Hebrew. Here! No way. - Here! - Shut up! This is where we used to eat. Mom, Dad, Ahmed, Fatma, Omar and Mariam And you? Sat next to Mom. The bathroom was here. Leave the rocks alone! You put the entire Holy Land in your bag, you nut! Leave him be. Thank you, thank you! OK, let's go. What's your problem? You think you're so great, huh? Why did you bring us here anyway? Have you ever had something stolen that you can't replace? Would you like to see it, but not be able to touch it? So, do you feel better now, Mom? Helps you remember what you've lost. Great, huh? You? You can tell your son what losers we are. Super! I'm staying. like being here. The others too. You can never be happy, that's your problem. Look. The special authorization we got thanks to your white friend. Look at it! We need that to visit our own village. Your mother's birthplace. It makes you happy. That's the problem. You thought wrong. - Did it go alright? - Yeah. - You brought them all back? - Yeah, don't worry. Spoke to ltamar. He's going to Tel Aviv. No. Not me. Not tonight. I'm so tired. What? It's not your war. We don't have much here. But we're suffering. Let us have that, at least. You can't just turn up here and play around with our shit like that. It's not yours. The Al Hayat hospital, please! Can get you close, but there are checkpoints everywhere. Swear, they're like hunting dogs. They targeted an activist cell in the camp. They're searching everything. Have to stop here. You'll be faster on foot anyway. My sister's in labor. We have to get to the hospital. Please. Don't want to be here either. I'd rather be somewhere else too. She can't deliver at the checkpoint! Who's playing today? Barcelona. Barcelona's playing? Are you a Barge fan? Memo! Mika's coming! Eight centimeters. Too much blood. Who's your favorite player?

Ziad was sentenced to 25 years. Little rat, little rat, you've lost your babies There's nothing for you here, little rat, little rat! - Looking for your baby, Rand? - Or your husband? There. We're done. Do you have a big day today? Do you finish late? If you'd come sooner, he wouldn't be dead. Wouldn't be a rat if you'd come sooner. Little slut! Now with the Arabs, now with the Jews! What will you tell them about us? Who tastes better, the Jews or the Arabs? Huh, Chloe? Who? Go back home, you dirty bitch! He'll be back soon. You OK? You sure? Watch it! - Like some coffee? - Yes. Here you are. Sugar. Yes, Mom, I'm alive. Stay in a straight line, please! , Rand Sabbah, prefer to exist in death than to live unseen. No one will ever again take away my right to exist.
