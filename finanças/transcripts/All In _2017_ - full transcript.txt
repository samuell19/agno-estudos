Good morning, Claus. What is a director's term? I know. Hey, Maya. - You meet late today, huh? - Yes. It's half past ten. - I know. - Claus! - Hi, Henrik. - There you were. Good to see you. - Likewise. Hey, Preben. Are you back everything? - Yes. Here you have me. - You know what? Sit down. Give me two seconds. I have to send an email. - Okay? - Yes. Yes, then... Then we just need to choose the color. You know what? My wife thinks it's a little too expensive. - But... - It's a wonderful car. I have to say thank you for the test drive. Preben? I can get full leather interior - - plus 19-inch alloy wheels for only 20,000 kroner. Okay. Well, I do not know. It sounds a bit... No, not at all. It is nothing... - So factory-fitted? Original? - Yes of course. I have a direct connection down to the factory in Rennes. What do you say? ALL IN - It is your turn. - 3000 rates. - Speak Danish at the table, thank you. - Sorry. - All in. Two tiers. - Fy father! Was it a large pool? 60-70 kilos? It's Claus. 200. Morn. - 1200. - Okay. - Well. - Put the phone away. Lets play. - Come on, damn it. - I can not speak right now. Thank you for calling. Okay. Thanks thanks. Good bye. Come on. It is your turn. 200. Look at your cards if you want to join. It was Dad. He's had a brain haemorrhage. - Come on now. - Dad has had a brain haemorrhage! - Yes, it's me... - Come on, damn it. I will have... ... four packs... 18-milligrams of tobacco. I have something Marlboro, and something a little light. Something's missing in something Prince. The rest is a little more funky tobacco. Then I think... Let me see... Wait... Marlboro, I think. - Pardon. - It goes well. Okay. I'll get you a glass of water. Shall I do it? Moment. You must not... Here. - You really have to apologize. - It's all right. It is for 100 kroner. ... we hand over Henning Holmby into your hands. Preserve him to a joyful resurrection in your kingdom. Hold on to the fact that in Jesus' human life you share our existence - - here on this Earth, and that you in his victory over death - - renews us to a living hope. Amen. Amen. You have come from earth. To earth you shall stay. But from the earth you will rise again. Our Father, you who are in heaven. Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come. May your will be done as in heaven, and on earth. Hello. Hey, Silas. I... - So... May I come in? - Yes of course. - Come in. - Thanks. Fy father. This is an insane apartment. I have nothing to offer you. Do you want a Red Bull? No thanks. I'm fine. How big you have become. Are you 1.90, or something like that? Yes. 1.94. But then I turned 19 too. You may have forgotten that. Of course I do not have it. I know you're 19 years old. I was actually wondering if I could stay overnight here? It's because I've left my boyfriend. - Oh, heck. That was sad. - Only tonight. I have to figure out what to do. Of course you can, Silas. - Yes, then... cheers, Silas. Cheers. Now I'm at the checkout at Bilka. Just to make money. Isn't there something else you fancy? Yes. I have not planned to be a cashier all my life. I have a stupid dream. I do not know if I want to say that. Stop it. What is it? Tell me now. - Do you promise not to laugh? - Yes of course. I want to be a deaf interpreter. - Deaf interpreter? - Yes. - Look, you're laughing. - No, that's not why. It's just pretty unusual. Then you must know sign language. - What does that mean? - Hey, you pretty. Shall we dance? - Father, how good you are. - Do you think? It's you. It's a good dream. That you must pursue. - I think so too... - God! - Silas, what the hell time is it? - I do not know. Stay here for five minutes and I'll be back. I did not think you were here. I was afraid our deal had gone in the sink. Of course not. - Yes... - Do you have the money? Yes, of course I have. - It must be there, everything. - Okay. Not because I do not trust you, but it's okay to just... Like that! Where were we? You told it in sign language. Yes. - I find it fascinating. - There must be a school. Sure, it's an education as a deaf interpreter. Sign language interpreter, I think it's called. You, Silas... Do you want to do something fun? Yes, it... Yes. What are you thinking about? Have you ever been to a casino? - What? Casino? - Yes, shall we not take a trip? - So, now? - Yes of course. - Shall we not drink up the beer? - We can only buy one beer out there. Hi! I think we start with... Let's see what we have here. One two three four five. Six thousand. - Three to you. - 3000? We start with that. Then you can see how it goes. And then you're with us next time. I played on the first 18 numbers. - 32, red. - Yes. Yes. Try. Just add something. - How much do you think? - All in. - All in? - Yes, you put everything you have. - Do you have a lucky number? - I think I play at 7. I play on the four there. - Yes, okay. - You have to believe in it, right? Now you can not play anymore. Then we'll just have... - 25, red. - Fuck. No no. - You're welcome! - How much have you played for? - 1500. - 1500? - We go and change again. - We have just lost 6000. Yes. That's how it is. You just have to believe it. - It's turning now. - Should I also just put them on? Everything? Yes. Whole thirds. I feel it coming now. 3000 more. Wait. Two seconds, I'm just going to... I'm just going to... Here. 100 kroner. You do not have money, do you, Silas? - Do you have 500 kroner, Harald? - No, Claus. You'll get a thousand again if you lend me 500. I do not have 500 kroner, Claus. So give me a hundred bucks. Make an effort. - 30, red. - Come on, Silas. Let's go. Good evening. - Come on. We're going in again. - Is not it just a fifty note? Red, 5. No more bets. 5, red. It is not true! - Welcome back. - Well, you have to say that. - Did you see that, Silas? - It was very good. I told you that, right? You just have to believe it. - We can just stick too. - No, we will stay here a little longer. - We take 5 again. - Again? Yes. I feel it. 5. 14. 16. - Are you sure? - Yes, now we are in the lead. - Congratulations. - Please, my friend. Like that. I'm just getting it. You just have to believe it. Have I won over there? - Heisan. - Hi. - It's my son. Silas. - Hey, Silas. We've just got it there! 17. Yes! - Do not be shy. - I can move a little. - Now he's shy. - You're doing very well here. - For an apartment. - Yes, it's raw, huh? - Silas, can you not... - Nice to wake up here on a Sunday. Why not? - Do you have girlfriends you can call? - We have lots of girlfriends. - Sit there between the ladies. - Is it nice to be out with dad? - Yes, it's not bad. - We will have more ladies. Okay? Far er stinn. No, champagne! - Good. Are you ready? - Yes! Bounce it! Hi! So cool! Come in. There is plenty to drink. Are you going to have champagne? Silas! Silas. Relax, Silas. This is cool. You'll go out and dance a little. Come here. We dance a little. Like that. Drink. Have you been to Monte Carlo? Look how big he is! Damn so cool. Like that! Cheers, everyone! Baby, deal. 5000 Euro against that. Yes, baby! It's my night! Toast. What do you have? If I win this, it's crazy. It's totally wild! Look here, then! Tut, tut! - Good morning. - Good morning, Silas. - Have you slept well? - Yes... - Are you all up? - Yes. I am going to work. - Can you make it? - Yes of course. It was fun last night, huh? - Fy father... - It was fun, huh? What happened? Are you crazy? You know what, Silas? You can just stay here. What are you thinking about? I was just thinking that you do not have to move out today. - Stay until you find something. - Do you think so? Yes of course. We're family, right? We will help each other. Thanks. I would love to. Hello. Is Wong in the office? They have a meeting. Go in and sit down. Returned! Bo Ming is no joke. - Sorry, mr. Wong. - You can not just come and go. - If we were not in a family... - Forgive me. - Disappear. - Pardon. - Never come back! - Sorry, mr. Wong. - Hey, Wong. - Hi. - Am I interrupting? - No. He has not paid his debt yet. Will he borrow more? Little Zhang, get a serving of chicken with chili. - What I just got. - I have no idea where he is. Was there anyone who could not pay the debt? It's Bo Ming. Some suddenly do not want to play anymore. What kind of game is that, Bo Ming? I've never heard of that. - Wong, is it a card game? - No. It's not for you. Where the hell is it going to be? Do I have to do it myself? He was just here. - Please, Claus. Spis. - Yes please. Eat, eat. - Wong? - Yes? I came to deliver this to you. - Thanks for the loan. - Oh, do you have money? It's all there. You are welcome to count. Yes. Boss, come here. Come here. - Tell them. Come on. - You can do that. It was not too bad this time. Let it go faster next time. - No delays. - Count them first. - I'm hiding them. - Is the amount correct? It was not too bad this time, but let it go faster next time. - He paid back. - In fact. Not so bad. - Is he mad because it's too late? - No. There are no problems. ... exciting years ahead of us. It's very nice. Yes. So... We have been visited by Serpentine from France. - Welcome. - Thanks everyone. Hello. Serpentine is what CitroÃ«n calls an efficiency manager. And when she travels back to the factories in Rennes, - - then we all drive five kilometers further on the liter. Almost 15 percent of the human brain is passive 24 hours a day. It applies to all people. We do not perform at the top level. The brain is lazy. It will not learn anything new. So my mission here is to provoke you - - to do things differently. Take off your shoes. - What did she say? - I ask you to take off your shoes. - Is it OK? - Of course. Okay. We take off our shoes and lie down on the floor. Imagine that you have transformed yourself into a tiny particle. Tiny small. And now you are going to travel through... ... your organism. Yes good! And then off. Perfect. Concentrate on my voice. Hello. Listen carefully, Philip. It's a little hot here now. So let's calm it down a bit. Do not call or send mail for a while. Do you understand? Okay. Fine, fine, fine. Good bye. - I have pizza with me. Are you hungry? - Yes, wonderful. And then I bought you a little thing in town. What is it? What? It was tough. I can not have a son who looks like a bum. Shall we go in the water? Yes, come on! We're in the water now! - Shall we not eat? - We do that afterwards. Now we're going to swim, Silas. Are you ready? What? No! No, stop. - I think I'll go in again. - No, Silas! Not now. No. Claus, for hell! Are you okay? It seems like things are going well for you at the moment. What are you doing again? - I sell cars. - Exactly. For Audi? No. It is a long time ago. I'm at CitroÃ«n now. It's a little strange. Mom has always described you as such a real... idiot, - - who has no control over shit. - Okay. - That's what she said, right? How is she really? Your mother? Fine, I think. She lives in North Jutland with Jens. They are having a good time. You're welcome. - Silas? - Thanks. - Is there something in the way? - No, it's nothing. Are you sure? That's just all about Caroline. - What's up with her? - She writes all the time. I think she's very upset. - Do you think they are marine hunters? - Probably something like that. It's probably some exercise. Silas, I'll drop you off at home. Why? Shall we not do something together? - I just have to fix something. - Can I not join? That's not right. And it only takes a couple of hours. - Are you going to the casino? - No. Yes, you should. I'm looking at you then. - Can you play poker? - Yes. Or... Yes, I can. I played many times when I went to youth club. What? Keep an eye on me all the time. Do not bet big, give yourself either. Good evening. Are there vacancies tonight? - There we have Claus himself. - You can fuck me swear at that. Is there room for two more? Sit down. - Did you bring the boy today? - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome. Report. - 3000. - Can I have one too? - Is this the first time? - Yes... or... - Up to 400. - Let's go out with 100. - 230. - Well, Vojkan? Think hard now. A thousand more. - Claus, you are... - Like that! You have to come. Your friend has problems outside. My friend? Hey, what the hell is going on? - What happened? - Your son owes me 250,000. He says he does not have them. - Silas, what happened? - It was... It went so fast. He has lost 250,000 in card games. What do you not understand, Claus? - What do you not understand? - Now you have to fuck me stop. You have not cheated Silas for 250,000 kroner. - Cheated? - Is not this a card club, Claus? - Yes. - He owes me 250,000. Damn the hell. Listen. This is his first time playing poker. Whatsoever. It's his fault. This is a beginner error. - Give him a chance. - Get lost. Now! What do you not understand? Come on. Michel, for hell. - I... - He's in shock. What do you say, Claus? I have a suggestion. I have 20,000 lying in there on the table. I have 20,000 here too. - What do you not understand, man? - Nothing. Nothing. You should get the 250,000... Shut up when I talk. And listen really well, you little pussy. You have 250,000 for me on Saturday. Did you understand that? Otherwise, I cut my finger off the little horn cub. Did you get it? Yes! I've got it. Real guy, he Claus. - Okay? - Okay. You deliver them out here in the club on Saturday. Come on. Let's finish playing. - Claus. - What the hell are you doing? I'm gone for two fucking seconds, and then you do something so enterprising! - Pardon. - Pardon? It went so fast. - Claus, I think they'm cheating. - Come on. - Here. - Thanks. Do they cut my fingers off? No. Of course they do not. - Take it easy. - That's what they said. You just have to relax and let me fix this. - Okay? - Fix it? Claus, that's 250,000 kroner. How? Yes, that is... There are several ways. I can... go to the bank or ask - - if I can borrow at work. I've done this before. - Hi, Henrik. - Come to my office. Good morning, Claus. Sit down. Thanks. Okay. Do you know a man named Philip Courmont? Philip Courmont? No I do not think so. Think hard. Take your time. Philip Courmont? The only one it could be... Henrik and I had dinner with one when we visited the factory last year. Is that him, do you think? You're absolutely right, Claus. Philip Courmont is an assistant in the equipment department in Rennes. Okay. Last night Philip called our legal department. - Can you guess why? - No. - Come on, Claus. - I do not know what you're talking about. - Can you help me a little, or? - Then I'll tell you. Philip made a confession. He was scared. - For what? - He told you all about the two of you. The scam you have been running for half a year now. He also explained that it was you who tricked him into this mess. What? It is not true. He's lying. He's a liar! I knew you would say that, so I asked Henrik for permission - - to check your email and phone. You can not. It is forbidden according to Danish law. - Are you aware of that? - I'm afraid it's too late. Did you allow her to do that? I have a copy of an annoying phone call you took to Philip Courmont. - It's over. - Get it. Sit down. Now you can tell him what's going on. Claus. You are fired. Wait. We beat some cold water in the blood. Give me a chance to give you an explanation of what happened. You can 't believe that, can you? - I'm your best man. - I do not want to listen to you. - Come on. Out. - I'm not going. Give me a chance to explain myself. - You've got your chance. Disappear. - I'm not going. You should fuck me be glad I did not report you to the police. Come on. And then I'll have some car keys. Thanks. Claus, stop. What have you done? - What's up? - Nothing. - Hi! - It's a misunderstanding, Maya. Lasse says you stole from the company. I have borrowed money. She's French. She's sick in the head! Claus... - Well, boys? Does it go away? - Hey, Claus. It's going well. - May I talk to you a little? - Of course. - What do you have on your mind? - Do you have a car I can borrow a little? You then have your own DS5 out there. What has happened to the luxury car? - I just got fired. - What ?! The French lady and Henrik gave me the fuck. I knew it. She's ruining the rest of us. I said straight out that I would not find myself in such a brainwashing. - You get to take care of what you say. - We must know. Hey, Silas. Why are you sitting there? - I think you have been thrown out. - Thrown out? A man came and said you should have been out yesterday. - All your cases are here. - What the f...? I think it's a misunderstanding. Give me a moment, okay? A misunderstanding has occurred. The apartment out on Islands Brygge... Someone came and changed the lock this morning. Did you cancel it? I had not realized that. If I come and watch tennis? Yes, of course I do. Now... Come on, Silas. We take the cases and carry them down to the car. Okay? Where is your own car? Let's face it. Then I'll give you an explanation. - Silas, I quit my job. - Oh. I had to. - I thought you liked the job. - I did it. But there are limits to what I can find myself in. Shall we get used to it? But what about the money? - Should not you borrow them from the company? - I'll probably fix it. I always do. You should not worry. Okay? Okay. Yes. We'll talk later, honey. Good bye. - Good morning. - Good morning. - For one morning, huh? - Yes. It was Caroline. - Was it Caroline? - Yes. - Well. What did she say? - She... I'll give it another try. She asked if I would move back home. Is that true, Silas? That's amazing. - Congratulations on that. - Thanks. I was actually wondering if you want to join in on the birthday. - What kind of a birthday? - Caroline's brother turns 15. I was going to ask Caroline's father. - About what? - If he can help with the money. He's very nice. He's a bit like that... storks in Bilka. I think you and he find the tone. Maybe he can get you a job. Hi! Tax. - I've missed you. - Likewise. This is Dad. - Hi. Caroline. - My name is Claus. - Nice to meet you. - Silas! So good to see you! So nice that you came. Lovely! That's nice. You must be Claus? Nice to finally meet you. Welcome. My name is Hasse. I'm Caroline's father. We are so happy that the two found each other again. We are very fond of Silas. He's a good boy. You are! By the way, I got the brochure from the interpreting school. - Is it true? Great! - Do you join in the congratulations? - It's Carl Christian. - Hi. - Claus. - Carl. Carl Christian is hard of hearing. Claus is the father of Silas. - Happy Birthday. - Thanks. - Thank you for coming. - Of course. - Could you imagine something to drink? - Yes please. Cheers and welcome. Silas, you're sitting here. - Hi. Claus. - Arendse. Hello. Claus. We agreed that we could manage to merge it. You've grown up. I think you just started school. I think we should give Carl a big cheer, and congratulate him. Welcome to the ranks of the adults. Does everyone have wine? Cheers. Very nice. - Yes. Great that you joined. - Was that correct? - Almost. I'm still using your little scissors Toast! - He's a very handsome boy. - Watch out, Claus. - Do you enjoy yourself? - Yes, it's a very nice party. Bitten and I are happy that we finally meet you. - Thanks likewise. - I was thinking about... Is it something that you are currently looking for a job? Yes. You could say that. I have been a salesman for very, very many years. - He was just at CitroÃ«n. - Yes. There I ended. But he was their best man. Is not that right? You could say that. I've been to Audi too. They have called from Mercedes and asked if I would not come to them. - So I'm calling them. - Then it's Mercedes next time. Carl? What are you talking about? We're talking about going out and having a beer. - What? - Do you come out and have a beer? - If I come out and have a beer? - Yes. Are you joining? I can do that well. Okay. And then we do this and that. Amalfi Coast. Have you never been there? - It is fantastic. - Okay. - I've heard that too. - Is it true? If I can help in any way... I know of many restaurants and hotels down there. Just call. - Thanks. - I really mean it. Claus. I need to talk to you sometime. What's been going on between you and Carl Christian? - What do you mean? - That money was for a moped. - That's what I mean. - What's up? Claus has somehow won Carl Christian's monetary gifts. 6000 kroner. - Geez, did you win...? - Listen. Let's take it easy. Yes, I've played with Carl. - And it was a joke. - Joking? That was Carl's idea. He wanted to play for money. What was on your mind?! He's a kid! - It was a joke! - It's not very funny. I wanted to give the money to Hasse. They are here. We talked. - I'll take them, thank you. - You do not have to make a scene. No, it's not... Tax. - You're going now. - What? Why now? I do not want to see you again, Claus. Okay, okay. Silas, sorry. I know it was my fault. - It was my mistake. Pardon. - It's too late now. - You've just been in there. - No human is flawless. - All people can make mistakes. - You're going now. - Get lost. - Where the hell am I going to go? I do not know. And I totally give a damn. Stick. Stick now! Stick now, I say! Silas! Listen. What do you want to do with that money? Have you talked to Hasse about it? Look at yourself. You should not think about that, okay? - Stick. Stick! - Silas! Go home with your Berlingo, Claus. CASINO You have to apologize... ... the shit I did last night. I have no idea what happened to me. So I think I got too much to drink. Silas, can you please call me? Can you please call me? It is important. Okay? Good bye. Nafar Fariquin. Welcome. Hey, Silas. It's me again. Why the hell are you not calling me? - If you do not call soon... - Sorry. No phones here. Please put it away. Thanks. Have you talked to Hasse, for example? Can you please call? Pardon. Can you please call me? - Do you have experience with toxic liquids? - No. - Do you know first aid? - No. Hi! Do you have experience with passports for the disabled and / or the elderly? - No. - No. But I'm very good at... with numbers. - With numbers. Not metal. - With numbers. Okay! Inventory. STK Transport. Are you aware that the basic salary here is 22400? The basic salary. And then... Yes, there is a 50% nightly surcharge. And a weekend supplement of 100%. Shall we go to the depot and find a T-shirt for you? - We can do that. - Fine. - 26! - Yes. - 23! - Yes. - 99! - Yes. - And then... 25. - Yes. - Do you come out and take a smoke? - When we have a break. - Is not it half? - Yes, in ten minutes. Then we go in ten minutes before. If you go, I'll tell Helle. Why? It's the same thing. She asked me to keep an eye on you. Here we work until we have a break. Go up and give me more numbers. - What kind of one do you want? - What? Whatever. Give me the cheap one. Two bottles. - This? - Perfect. - More? - No thanks. 200 kroner. Hey, Silas! Damn so many times I've tried to get you. How are you? 500,000. Otherwise what? Who is this? What the hell, Claus...? Can you lend me 500,000? - It is a lot of money. 500,000. - You'll get them back, Wong. You know that. I've always paid you back. Claus will borrow 500,000. It is urgent. What do you say? He again? No. 500 000. We can not do that. Unfortunately. Wong. You have to help me. - You have to help me. - It's too much. I know! But you get your money back! - You can borrow 100,000, okay? - 100,000 is not enough. - It's way too much. - Yes, but they have my son! - I have to get my son back! - Unfortunately, Claus. I'll offer you a million if you play Bo Ming tonight. - No, he's unable. - A million. What is he saying? What is he saying? My uncle says - that if you play Bo Ming tonight, - - then you can get a million at once. - A million? - Yes. I would love to. Damn it, Claus, do you understand what Bo Ming is? - No. - It's no joke. What is it? I do not know. Bo Ming is one of them. And then open and insert one. And then... bang! And then again. Bang! I'm dead. You get a million at once. Do you understand? No. It's serious. I must have 500,000 kroner. Can you help me with that, Kenneth? 14, red. What the hell are you doing here? You have to help me. You're damn amazing. Disappear before I call the police. I just want to give you an explanation. You're the only one - - who can help me now. I really need your help. You just have to listen to me for two minutes. - Should I call the police? - Stop it. Henrik. - They say we have to hurry. - We can not drive faster. I said we were there soon. Here we are. Drive. We'll be there in a moment. We almost arrived. Come here. I'm ready. It was well done. Where did you find that idiot? It's his playmate. I found him. - I hope he can stand the game. - Take it easy. He can handle it. It goes well. We lost a lot the last few times. Now we win it back. - Take it easy. It goes well. - I hope you'm right. - Take it easy. - Tonight a lot is at stake! Incredibly much! - It goes well. - Come on! Sit down, Claus. Look into the camera. The game starts soon. Stop! Get away. The game we play tonight - - is called Bo Ming. Few rounds... ... will determine their fate. First round. There's just one bullet in the revolver. Mumbai starts! Then it's your turn. Come on. Start! I'm doing it now. Claus. You made it. You made it! I knew it! - We won! We won! - Let's go. We won! We won! We won! - We won!

I really hope you appreciate what your father has done. - It looks good, Claus. - Real guy, you, Claus. - It's Caroline. - Oh well. Hasse may have gotten you a job at Bilka. As deputy head of the green department. It's very kind of him. Yes, of course. - What is wrong? - Nothing. You do not want to, do you? Are you okay? Silas, just keep the bag. Father? Thanks. Thank you. Henrik Larsen Biler, it's Maya. Can you wait a minute? - Claus! - Hey, Maya. - Why are you here? - I'll deliver something to Anders.
