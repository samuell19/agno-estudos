We already have all of that taken care of. We have sent thank you gifts to all of the speakers, and we've donated all the leftover food to our local homeless shelter. Yes. Hi, coffee. Absolutely. Bigger is always better. Thank you. Right. Yes, we agree. - Hi. - Hi! - You've got flowers. - Ooh, beautiful. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Ooh, flowers. - A thank you from Tracey and Cary. They've got great taste. You are telling me. They've already hired us for their next event and they don't even have a date yet. Oh. Well, have I got a surprise for you. Oh, me too. - You ready? On three. - Yeah. One, two, three. Oh, we look good. We look so good. This is going to take us to the next level. Can you imagine all of our new clients? Hold on. We just did our biggest event. Yet. And it was really hard. Please don't tell me you forgot all of the late nights, all of the long hours. Yeah, but it put us on the map or on the front page of the Events section. Oh, wait, what time is it? I'm supposed to meet George - for lunch. - Isn't it kind of early? Yeah, but he's got to catch a flight again. Oh. So what's the deal with you two anyway? I just like spending time with him. - When he's in town. - Yeah, it's casual and breezy. Oh, because you're so breezy. Yeah. And it doesn't hurt that your mom loves him. All right, so I'm not seeing him to please my mom. Of course not. Okay, maybe it's nice that she and I agree on something. Oh, Kate. Okay, let's go. - Hey. - Hi. - How are you? - I'm good, how are you? - I'm great. - Good. - Have a seat. - Thank you. Since we're on a tight schedule, I took the liberty of ordering our usuals. Perfect. So, where is my mother sending you off to this time? London, Berlin by way of Paris, a quick trip to New York Fashion Week, then LA. All of my favorite places. You know, there isn't anything saying that I can't have a plus-one on these trips. I think you might have an in with my boss. Yeah, maybe, but, you know, work. Of course. Hey, whenever you get back, why don't we plan a little trip of our own? Something a little more local. There is this new gallery opening at the Modern Art Museum, we should go. Let's put in a date. - Okay. - Yeah. Okay, so how's three weeks from now? I could do the 18th. Mm. I am leading a retreat that weekend. How about the next week? I'm in Seattle. How about the 5th? That's next month. That's six weeks away. We've been apart longer. Okay, you're right. Let's pencil it in. Hm, it's my mom. "Urgent, need to see you now," all caps. Any ideas? I'm afraid not. Ugh, gosh, I should go. But our lunch. I know Margaret. You should go. I'll give you a call before I board. - Okay. - Yeah. - So good seeing you. - You too. - Bye. - Bye. Kate, you came so quickly. Well, your text said it was urgent. It is. Pierre has quit on me. Uh, your dog walker? No, that's Pierce. Pierre, my meeting planner of 20 years left me for retirement two weeks before my gala. It's your turn, my dear. I'm sorry, what? You're going to plan the Garden Gala. - Excuse me? - Aren't you absolutely over the moon? Uh, yes, I am, but it's just so soon and... Welcome to the fast lane, Katie. Okay, so, what will people say about you just handing the event over to your daughter? I know, nepotism has always been a bit of a bee in your bonnet, but your mother is Margaret Lord and there's no getting around that. If you want to be the best, then you need to plan the best, and this gala is the best. But I've never planned anything to this scale before. I can't think of a better way to prove what you're made of. - Fire only... - Strengthens the iron, I know. Think of all you stand to gain. The magazine's biggest issue of the year is devoted entirely to the gala. - I'm aware. - Imagine all the publicity you'll receive, national attention. So, Picture-Perfect Planning will be in Lord's July issue? I'll do you one better. A feature on you and Dina in the July issue. Tell me you could say no to that. And we'll get full say over the feature, complete control over how our business and mission are presented? Well, I'm still editor-in-chief, but, yes, I see no reason why you can't be fully involved. Oh. Well, I've always wanted to plan the gala. All the guests and the buzz. You know, that's the reason that I wanted to get into event planning in the first place. It's just that I... Think of this as an opportunity. I'm giving you the chance to take the Lord name and make it your own. But if you're not up for the task... No, no, I'm up for it. We will plan the Garden Gala. Ah, splendid! And Dina will agree too. She will love this. I do not love this. Two weeks to plan the biggest social event of the year? But it basically plans itself. Weren't you just talking about not wanting to be - in your mom's shadow? - Well, yes, but this is my chance to prove myself. I want to show that I am every bit as capable as the Lord name suggests. Kate, you do not have to prove yourself. But I do, to my mom, to the city, to myself. If you don't think that we're up to the task, then we don't have to do it. Make me the bad guy. You know how much this event meant to my dad. He would want me to do it. Don't tug at my heartstrings. Kate. Okay, think about it like this, when we do this event, everyone is gonna be lining up to work with us and we'll finally have the money to expand our team. What do you say? The July issue? Can you believe it? Guess I'll need to figure out what to wear. That's the spirit. Yes! Okay, we're doing this! Hey, George, I've got some big news to share. Give me a call whenever you get settled into your hotel room. - Hey! - Didn't see you there. Obviously. Sorry about that. Good thing you were here crouched behind this bush. - What? - Are you hiding from someone? Why would you say that? Ah, so you're spying on someone. - No. - That guy? Hey, keep your voice down. You were totally checking him out. I don't have time for this. Sure you don't want to head in that direction? No, but you should watch where you're going. Nice running into you. That simply will not do. Oh, no, I'm so sorry. Some idiot just... oh. Hi there. You. You know this man? - Well, he... - I'm the new head of operations at the garden. Danny Miller. Picture-Perfect Planning. Kate. Nice to meet you, picture-perfect Kate. - You're late. - We were just going over some logistical details for the event. There's some minor disagreements. We have done it this way every year. The man that had your job before you was a dear friend that understood the importance of this gala. Yeah, I understand. It's just that there are some... Frankly, you should be honored that such a high-profile event is being held here. If this is the relationship we have with the garden going forward, I might have to reconsider working with you. Perhaps my event can find accommodations elsewhere this year. The gala is in two weeks. I'm happy to work out a compromise. Do you know who I am? Surely we can work something out. Uh, is that a twig in your hair? - Um... - Oh, Kate. When I hired you to do this, I thought that you would take it seriously. I am. Then show it. Talk some sense into this man. I cannot spend my entire day arguing about dirt. Ugh. Bye. Dina, will you go after her? I'm the last person she wants to talk to right now. Ugh! - Mr. Miller. - Danny. Mr. Miller, whatever Margaret Lord wants, she gets. Do you have any idea what goes into putting this place back together after your little event every year? Well, if it's a question of money, - then that's not an issue. - It's not about money. Well, then what's the problem? This is a habitat first, not a party venue. This is not just some party. You could've fooled me. Oh, Margaret, if we could just... Get in. Margaret, I probably should stay with Kate. I have a tight schedule to keep. I'm already running late. Um, sure. Do you have something to take notes? Yes. Let's get to work. How long have you had your job? This is my six-month anniversary. Thank you for asking. And did your predecessor explain the gala to you? Yeah. He mentioned it. - He mentioned it. - Look, I was hired to look out for the garden's best interest. Okay, well, the gala is the biggest event of the year. Everyone who's anyone will be there. Well, darn. Guess that's why my invitation - always gets lost in the mail. - Your garden is going to be featured in Lord's July issue. What does that even mean? - You can't be serious. - Look, I'm not saying that we can't host it. I just think that adjustments need to be made. Here. - What's this? - These are ways to change the event to better protect the garden. Oh. You gave this to Margaret? Well, I tried. I mean, she didn't exactly take it. No wonder she stormed off. You've changed practically everything from flooring to seating arrangements, press access. Only certain types of flowers can be allowed in the garden? - Are you serious with this? - Hey, with the right attitude, I think it's manageable. Do you know who Margaret Lord is? You're not that oblivious, are you? Sorry, I don't believe in special treatment. Do you understand what goes into planning a gala, the painstaking attention to detail for every decision from tablecloths to light bulbs? There is a reason that the Lord Gala is the way that it is that you're not considering. And why are you smiling? No, it's just it's funny that everyone involved in your event seems to be... What's the word I'm looking for? Oh, I can think of a few right now. - Tense. - Hm, maybe that's just because they're dealing with you. If you would just look at the documents... I have and, frankly, your laissez-faire attitude is on my last nerve. I have to go. There is no way that this can be done in two weeks. - So soon? - You'll hear from me. We're gonna deal with this later. Well, I look forward to it. Kate, you're... The door is... Not a word. You will not believe the conversation I just had with the gardener. Oh, it couldn't have been worse than my car ride with your mother. On a scale from one to ten, how mad was she? - Ice cold. - Oh. That bad. Of course, luckily, I was my level-headed self, so I assured her we had everything under control. Okay, good. I have no idea how we're gonna do that! Kate, this is not a great start to our biggest event yet. Do not start doubting me now. Look at this list. Eh, well, this looks like my mother. This one is from the gardener. For him to be so new, he sure has a lot of input to give. I know, right? Everything on this list is doable, it's just a lot. Kate, we've got 14 days to get all of this together. We can do this. You know, it's not too late to ask Margaret to offer this to another event planner. Did you tell her that? No, I'm saying it to you! Your mother was even more high-strung than usual. Yeah, you noticed that too, huh? Yeah, I've been worried that this event is too much on her after everything that happened with my dad last year. Dina, this one is important. We have to do it right. Are you doing this for us or for you? Both. I wouldn't ask if I didn't think we could do it. Okay, so what about your garden man? Leave him to me. All right. Here. Okay, so, you move the tables to Lily Terrace. Oh, then the step and repeat can be on Cherry Esplanade. Wow. You did all this last night? Earth to Kate. Oh, sorry. It's okay, I get it. I know how you feel about reporters. Yeah. I know the interview aspect is necessary for our future, but every time I'm in a room with press, they always want to talk about my personal life, and I just hate that it always goes back to my mom. I'll kibosh any kind of question like that. Just let me do the talking. - Thanks, Dina. - I am very charming when I want to be. - Dina, hey. - Hey. Great to see you again. This color looks amazing on you. Oh, you think so? Kate, this is Liz Booth and Mike O'Connor. Liz will be doing the reporting and Mike will be doing the photos for the article. - So great to meet you. - Hi there. Hi, it's nice to meet you too. You know, I've covered big events before but never the Lord Gala. So I'm super excited to get in there and see what it's all about. So you're familiar with the event? Yeah, I mean, who isn't? Oh, afraid I'm not. Mike is new to the event coverage business, but don't let his greenness fool you. He's super talented, and he's already won the Rising Newcomer Award for his work last year in Peru. Oh. That's impressive. Thank you. Margaret is a hero of mine. What isn't there to love about her? You must have so much to say about growing up with her. We really want to keep this focused on planning the event. It's actually what Margaret would want. Whatever Margaret Lord wants, goes. Well, we'd love to get the lay of the land sometime. I've never been to the Botanic Garden. Well, it's amazing there and I would be more than happy to show you around sometime. Both of you, of course. That would be great. I'm gonna get washed up. - Excuse us. - Mm-hm. What was that? What was what? "Happy to take you on a tour sometime." It's for the feature. Oh, really? Hm. Have we forgotten about George already? Already? It's strictly professional. Ugh, Kate! It's professional, I promise. Whatever. Well, if it isn't picture-perfect Kate. Mr. Miller, we need to set our next meeting. Do you have your calendar available? Uh, sure. Okay, let's meet tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. and start talking about logistics. 9:00 a.m.? Oh, looks like I have a breakfast meeting then. Okay, what about noon? Oof, that's my lunch meeting. How about 2:00 p.m.? Are all of your meals done by then? Sorry, could you, uh, hold please? My assistant needs me. If I didn't know better, I would think that you're trying to avoid me. Now why would I do that? I mean, it's not every day that I'm yelled at by somebody that I just met. Twice, in fact. Okay, if we could just put that behind us and focus on the task at hand, we could get through this pretty painlessly. What is your next available time? As luck would have it, my noon just cancelled. How fortuitous. 12:00 p.m. then? In my calendar. Oh, and, Kate? Yes? You should really call me Danny. Hi there. Hi! I wasn't expecting you so soon. Dina is still out at lunch. She'll be back in about a half hour. Uh, well, actually, I was stopping by to see if you were free for lunch. We could chat about the article or just chat. - I can't. - I see. It's... no, it's not, um... I just have this food tasting thing I have to go to for the gala. Is that something you would want to go to? Uh, yeah. Yeah, I'd love to. You should know I'm really great at eating food. Oh, well, this is perfect then. I just need to drop something off in the office - really quick, okay? - Okay, yeah. Okay. You must be a creature of habit eating here so often. You have no idea. That is where George and I eat every time he's in town. And who is George? Oh, yeah, he's, um... Well, he's, uh, he's my... - Boyfriend. - No. We're barely even in the same time zone. He's just someone I like to spend time with. - Oh, one of those. - Yeah. Bad luck for George, but good news for me. I have to say, this is better than where I would have taken you. It's like 12 lunches in one. It is, yeah. That's not going in Lord, is it? Oh, these aren't for the magazine. Don't worry. So, then why are you taking pictures? Um, guess I just like what I see. Hm. Okay then. And this one? Ah, so that is a tiny village outside of Lima. Yeah, my Spanish was a little rusty, but I got by. Oh, she's beautiful. Oh, yeah, Amaya. Yeah, there was something about her eyes that just... haunted you, you know? I still feel like I never quite captured it. You must meet a lot of... interesting people on your travels. Yeah, well, you know who else thought that Amaya was beautiful? Her husband and two kids. I'm sorry, I just assumed. I mean, you have so many pictures of her. Yeah. Well, um, when I see something beautiful... I like to hold on to it. Um, so, what made you want to get into photography in the first place? Nice swerve. What? Something tells me that you're not good at taking compliments. - You know what that means? - What? It means you don't hear them nearly enough. Oh, that was smooth. Well, I say what's on my mind. So, what is a gala like anyway? Uh, glamorous. It's a lot of work. And how is working with your mom? By the way Liz talks about her, Margaret Lord sounds intense, demanding, high expectations, never smiles, kind of scary. She's my mother. Yeah, well, doesn't mean she can't scare you. She's a great mother, and she's really great at her job. Mm. And there's nothing more to the story? All right, that settles it. Before this gala is over, I am gonna get your mom to laugh, smile even. - Oh, really? - How about that? Oh, yeah, yeah. I'm hoping that it'll impress her daughter. You think it'll work? Uh, well, I guess we'll see about that. Oh, how was the tasting that took all afternoon? It was great. How was Mike? What? Got 'em. Ha-ha! Liz told me he was coming to see you. Oh, you were with Liz. Well, yeah. We were just going over the history of the gala. And, frankly, she knows a lot more about the event than I do. Don't you think Liz is cute? She's your type, isn't she? We're not changing the subject just because you don't want to talk about your date with Mike. Oh, it wasn't a date. First of all, we just had some food and then we talked about our lives, and he, uh, might have called me beautiful. Oh, totally doesn't sound like a date. It wasn't. He's just passionate and spontaneous. So, he's the opposite of George? Ah, Kate, do you have a crush? Can we just go back to focusing on work, please? Whatever. And for the record, Liz is very cute. I knew it! I knew it. I'm gonna be a matchmaker. It's done, it's a done deal. Stop it. Back to work. Oh, now she wants to go to work. - Hey, baby bro. - William. Whoa, this is a surprise. A good one, I hope. Of course. I'm taking you to lunch to celebrate my big win. - You heard, right? - Yeah, yeah, Mom told me. It's not just a big case. It's my first win at my own firm. I'm proud of you, Will. So, let's celebrate. What do you say? Your choice, my treat. Now? I got to work. Come on, you can play hooky for a few hours. I'm sure the flowers can wait. Look, I wish that I could, but I can't. Rain check for another day? What's the point of being the boss of this place if you can't give yourself a break? Soon, I promise. And it'll be your choice, my treat. I guess I can let today slide. You are coming to the family dinner at Chez Manon - in a couple weeks, right? - On the river? How did you get a reservation? Don't they book a year in advance? I know a few people, pulled some strings. Of course you did. You'll be there, right? Mom and Dad are really looking forward to it. It's my one-year anniversary of starting my firm. Jackie and the kids are gonna be there. It's really important. I'll be there, yeah. I'll have my assistant send you the details. And, Danny, don't work so hard. If I can take some time off for lunch, you definitely can. You made it on time and in one piece. Well, nobody attacked me with a plant today, so... Ah, the day is still young. Though I'm not sure you're dressed in the right outfit for walking around in the heat of the day. I'll be fine. So, those are your walking shoes, then? It's called being professional. You should try it sometime. Let's go. I've gone over your proposal in detail. Ah, you have. And? And I think that we can make almost all of it work. Almost? You used the word "compromise" the other day, remember? Ah, you were listening. I was listening, yes. I just didn't like what I was hearing. We aren't the enemy. My mother loves this garden. It's why she chooses to have her biggest event here. Your mother. Margaret? I thought you might figure it out by now, but the last name kind of gives it away. I can see a few similarities. It's not a secret, I just don't lead with it. Anyway, I do support your goal of showing off the natural beauty of this place. I'm surprised to hear that from you. Why? Do I look like I hate plants? Well, I mean, you said it. I am planning, as you would say, a very big, fancy party, so we have to meet in the middle. Wow, you've got a great eye for this. You sound surprised again. - I wasn't expecting... - Me to do my job? I know we got off on a rough start, but there's no reason that we can't be civil. Do you know you get very robotic when you get all formal? "There's no reason we can't be civil." What do you want from me? You're either getting your feelings hurt - because I'm yelling at you... - I never said... or I am a cold, uncaring robot. Can't we just talk like normal people? You're the one who is treating me like I'm another species, making fun of my clothes, the way that I talk, the way that I show emotion. - Okay, hold on... - You do not fool me, Mr. Miller. You are clearly intimidated. You've never worked with someone of our caliber before on an event of this magnitude, so you're covering it up with your bravado and your inane jokes. So you're a party planner and a psychologist? Hate to break it to you, but you're pretty simple to figure out. True. And this is... My list of compromises. Look, I imagine there's a lot riding on this for you, as it's your first year in the role, and there's a lot riding on it for me because it's my first year planning the gala. It's in our best interests for it to run smoothly. This is great. Yeah, I can totally get this. Conservation is right up my alley. Oh no, that's the wrong one. All reusable materials, compostable, recyclable, energy efficient... This is music to my ears. This is what Margaret wants, so... Okay, but what about that one? That looked amazing. No, this is for my eyes only. We're doing this one because it's what Margaret wants. Okay, there's that echo again, "what Margaret wants," but she hired you, right? Isn't it your job to bring something new to the table? Did you bring something new to the table when you took this job? As a matter of fact, I did. What? A new soil regimen? Right. Well, there's only one thing we can do about this. I'm not following. A little friendly competition to see which dossier wins. Come on. Okay. Looks like the secret plan wins. Well, you still have to take your turn. Oh, easy. Here we go. - Yess! - Ugh! That is so unfair! You chose a competition that you knew you could win. Of course. Look, I wanted to make sure that I won so that we could work on your vision for the gala. It is a great idea. It doesn't matter if my mom won't approve it. Well, I mean, she trusts you, right? I don't think that my mom trusts anybody but herself. That's probably why she's so successful. But she is gonna have to put her faith in me for this. Okay, and what about you? What about me? Why is the gala so important to you? Well, you know, because of all the celebrities, obviously. Okay, Lord, let's get going. Another big day tomorrow. What's the time difference again? Uh, six hours, I think... Hi, Mom! How's your 24 hours in Madrid? I'm late to a dinner. We'll be fast. How do you feel about the new table setup? Dina, is that you? I can't see you, dear. Were you able to view the new layout? We can screenshare if you want. I'm on my cell phone. The reception isn't great. Mom, can you see our screen? It's frozen! I'm trying. Hit that button. Ohh. Kate! Hold on, you're frozen. Who's that? - Can you see me? - Sorry, Mom hold on. No, it's George. Is there someone else on the call? Mom, can you hear us? I can hear you fine. George? You sound a little irritated, Katie. Mike? Who's Ike? Sorry, Margaret, we're having some connection issues. The button is still frozen. Uh, snack break? Who's that? Is this a bad time? Should I go? - No! - Yes! Girls, I don't have time for this. Mom! We need your approvals before we can move on. You're breaking up. Got it... ugh! Ohh. Technology is not my friend today. I'm sorry. - That was a disaster. - It was. Chocolate? - Hey. - Hey. You didn't want to have this meeting inside, in your office? Why be cooped inside all day when there's fresh air waiting for us? Guess somebody's had his coffee today. You don't like the sun, Kate? I'm just partial to air conditioning, okay? What is all this? Well, you asked me what changes I made to the garden. Here it is. It's... a pile of dirt. Okay, I know that it doesn't look like much now. It looks like a big pile of dirt. But if you use your imagination, try to picture this as a working garden. See, my goal is to get people here who have never been before, and we work the garden together. So you wanna get people here that can work for you for free. Okay, it's not for me, it's for the garden. Okay, fruits, vegetables, herbs, flowers. And it will all be available for the community to take home. Okay. And you're doing this all by yourself? Not today. Come on. Let's get to work. If you can handle it. There's that judgment again. Kate, I wasn't serious. You don't have to dig, all right? You're wearing high heels. I am not afraid of a little bit of gardening work. Well, you're doing it wrong. I... guess I skipped breakfast. Okay. Just hang on a sec, I'll be right back. All right. Here you go. Perks of being the boss, access to our volunteer supplies. Thank you. I also grabbed this. I am not going to eat your lunch. Okay, suit yourself. If you insist. So I was thinking about what you said about putting my spin on things, and you were not entirely wrong. Wow, what a compliment! I was crunching the numbers, and it looks like most of my ideas can be implemented... If I can get approval from Margaret. Hey, that's great. If I talk to my mom, and I'm not saying I'm going to, then it's gonna require a lot more from you, a lot more hard work and a lot more hours. Hey. I'm not afraid of a challenge. In fact, I love hard... Don't you dare say you love hard work or I'm gonna throw this sandwich at you. Well, we wouldn't want that. Nope. You know, it's just my opinion, but I think it's pretty brave to step out of your celebrity mom's shadow and do your own thing. But what do I know? Yeah, you're right, what do you know? I really walked into that one. Yes, you did. Hey, you know what? We should feature your community garden in the magazine. It's a great angle on the green aspect for the gala, and it's great press for you. The July issue is kind of a big deal, you know? Really? You'd do that for me? It's a win-win for us both. And there's no such thing as bad press, right? Right. Of course. Cheers. Cheers. Why are the tables here? I think it makes for a nice flow of traffic. No? And these are new. Well, they're super energy efficient, which goes right along with our green theme. For the environment? Green? Recycled fabrics for the decor, utilizing solar panels, sustainable fashion... What are you talking about? Didn't you read my emails? You know how busy I am. It's the new angle on the gala, my angle. Kate, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel here. The gala has always been a smashing success as it. Yeah, but with Danny's list, we need to... Who? The head of the garden? Why are you listening to that man? An important part of your job is knowing when to stand up for yourself. Right, it's just that... Well, then tell the man no, Katherine. I have to get this. Are we good? Actually, I feel like we need to get... Kate, I know you'll get this all under control. I have complete faith, remember? Margaret Lord. Oh yes. - Hey. - Hey! How was the meeting with Margaret? Well, she's not exactly reading our emails. Are you kidding me? We need her approval so we can get the deliverables in time. I know. But she trusts me, so we should just move ahead as planned. As soon as she sees everything, she's gonna love it. Okay, if you say so. I do. Ohh! These came for you. Hm! Flowers? From Mike? George. You remember him. Yeah, of course. George. That's what I meant. Mm-hm. I did mean George, I was just... thinking about Mike. You were thinking of Mike? Well, yeah, he's been texting. He's been texting? Do I have an echo in here? What up? Oh, sorry. That's something Danny would say. - Who? - Danny? Oh! So Danny's in the mix now? - Well, there is no mix. - There is no mix? Mike, Danny, George. That sounds like a mix to me. Okay, so, um, yeah. Mike is, uh... and Danny is, well... Uh-huh. Okay, so, George, he's my... Uh-huh. You know what's so funny? You have all these prospects sending you flowers and bringing you candy, and why can't I get one date, not one date, Kate? Hold on. Hello? Dina, hi, it's Liz. Hey, Liz. I was wondering, are you free tomorrow evening sometime to discuss interview questions? I know this great little place over by... I-I can't, I have to help Kate with gala stuff. Wanna email me instead? I could help. With the gala? It'll be pretty boring. Oh, Liz, thank you so much! Yes, we'll take the help. I have your phone number and I will just text you the address. Perfect. Thanks, Kate. Thank you. Why did you invite Liz over? Nothing we're doing is gonna be helpful for the article. Earth to Dina! Potential suitor just asked you out! Into... into me? Into me? Mm-hm. You think so? What are we gonna do with you?! Ohh! So at that point, I am completely covered in mud, head to toe. I'd pay to see that. Bet you would. Yeah, so, I managed to wrangle the dog just minutes before the photo, and then I started thinking twice before I ever took an event with animals again. You seem like more of a cat person. Independent, aloof, never know what they're thinking. Are you calling me a cat? Hey, if the high heel fits. As opposed to a big, brainless dog that's just running around chasing its tail? Hey. Brainless? Okay. Dogs are smart. That's hurtful. Don't dish it if you can't take it, Danny Miller. You know, I was thinking. You should give a speech at the gala. Yeah, well, I'd have to be at the gala in order to get a speech, so. Wait, you're not going? No. Well, Danny, you have to, you run the place. That kinda stuff's just not for me. I'm not fancy. I think that the nicest thing I own are my formal pair of khakis. Come on. That can't be. Parties just aren't for me. Okay. What are you doing? All right. Meet me here tomorrow at this time, and don't be late. Do I strike you as the kind of person that shows up late? No, and make sure to bring that awesome personality. Do I have a choice? - You do not. - Okay. And Danny? I am a dog person. Wow. - Hi! - Hi! Hi, Kate. Hi, Dina. - Hi! - Thanks for coming. Those are lovely flowers. Oh, um, actually, this is for you. Oh. Thank you for inviting me. And these are for you. Oh. Come on in. Wow. You guys have quite the operation. - Mm. - How can I help? Well, Dina and I were just discussing what to have for dinner. We were? - We were. - Oh. What kind of food do you like, Liz? Um, I love Italian. That's funny. Dina loves Italian too. Everybody loves Italian. Because it's the best. Absolutely. But, see, Kate's idea of Italian is that frozen pizza defrosting in there. Ooh! Were you two really planning on eating that tonight? Kate is good at many things, but cooking ain't one of 'em. It's not like you're any better. Shh! I can whip something up. Mind if I look in your fridge? Oh, no, go right ahead, yeah. Whoa, okay, I don't know about this. You just said you trust me. You can't have the very important job of running the botanic garden and not look the part. At least for one night, anyway. Let's go. Do you even know what these are? Yeah. I've worn a suit before. Prom doesn't count. Oh. Yeah, that's what I thought. This one looks nice. And by nice, I mean expensive. Ah, yeah, you have good taste. Actually, I think my brother has this one. He's the suit guy. Oh. Well, you never mentioned having a brother before. Oh yeah, I've got a brother. He's a lawyer. - Oh. Hence the suits. - Mm-hm. You've probably seen his ads around town. "William Miller. He's here for you." Hm, actually, I do think I've seen him on a billboard before. That's your brother, huh? He looks like a model, that smile! That's William. He's pretty much perfect in every way. Well, I can see the family resemblance. Really? I always thought we looked nothing alike. Well, why don't we find you something that makes you feel more like you and less like your brother? Perfection's overrated anyway. Whoa! That's looking good. Hey, you should try that on. Eh, I'm just looking. Come on. I can't be the only one in this fashion show. Eh, it's not really me, though. Yeah, well, you won't know until you try it. Come on, come on! - Okay, fine. - Yes! Wow. My mother would hate this. How do you feel about it? I love it! Wait, Danny, this is it, this is your suit! Yeah? Yeah. You look amazing. I was gonna say the same thing. Um... I should get that. Yeah... yeah. Hi! Yeah, everything is going really well. William. Hey. I've got great news. How would you like to come work with me? What? Yeah, a guy at my firm needs someone to head his new venture project. It's a great deal with tons of opportunity for growth. He knows you're my brother and he can't wait to meet you tomorrow morning. You set up a meeting? Look. You're smart, and you can accomplish anything you put your mind to. This is your chance to nail down a great job. Well, I have a great job. A very competitive job that I was just hired for. I know. It won't look so good to leave this soon, but it'll be worth it. This is real money and a chance to use your full potential. William, you shouldn't have. Look, just meet with the guy, hear what he has to say, and then tell me what you think. Nine a.m., my office. I'll have my secretary send you the invite. - I don't think I... - I gotta go, and I won't take no for an answer. See you tomorrow. So tell me, what aspect are you most looking forward to this year? The Lord Gala is going to be a spectacular event, just as it is every year. I normally wouldn't go with a business as small as Picture Perfect, but as it's Katie's, I knew I had to use them. What good is having Margaret Lord as your mother if you can't enjoy a few perks? Mom! Um... how has this year brought about new changes to the gala? I know Kate and Dina have been talking about their green initiative. Yes. Florals are very important. Ninety percent of our gala will be using recycled items, from the flooring made of old tires and the centerpieces made from repurposed art. From top to bottom, we are committed to sustainability. Excuse me. Are you okay? My mom isn't even giving Liz the time of day. It's like she knows nothing about this event. And what was that dig about our small business? - Oh God, I know! - Right? I mean, she is just telling the truth. I am her daughter. But was it wrong for me to say yes to this? Hey. Get that doubt out of your head. We are amazing at what we do, and that is why we got this job. The whole sustainability goal? That was all you! You are making this happen. Who are you and what have you done with my best friend? I've never seen you this positive. I am not an optimist. I'm a realist. And I realistically know we gon' crush this gala, girl. So get on board, Lord. Now, where were we? Um, I think we have everything we need. Um, if I have any logistical questions, I'll reach out to Dina, but yeah, I think this is gonna be a fantastic look at how an event like this comes to life. You two were made for the July issue. Thank you. A pleasure. Mom? Why would you say that to the press? That you gave me this job just because I'm your daughter? I didn't say that, exactly. The perks of having Margaret Lord as my mother? It's my magazine, and it's no secret you're my daughter. I thought you gave us this job because of how capable we are. You know, passing along the Lord torch and all. I am. You haven't read any of my emails. No, I've looked at a few, and they're all great, I'm sure. Mom! You focus on the job at hand and not what might be written about you. If I worried about what people said about me, I would have left this industry before you were even born. I know, but Mom, I... I'm late. Can we connect later? And... watch your posture, Katie. You're starting to slouch again, we can't have it. Hey, Danny? Here he is, the official photographer for the official photos of the working garden. - Danny. - Mike. That's a firm grip. Now, I know it doesn't look like much yet, but we've actually done a lot of work on it this past week. Oh, you've been working on this? Why do you look so surprised? Yeah, Kate is great at gardening. Oh, well, I wouldn't expect anything less. Okay, so, for these photos, we're just looking for something to highlight the benefits of the garden. All right, well, we have to get the man in there himself. Aww, I'm more of a behind-the-scenes kinda guy. Oh, come on, Danny. It's your project. It would be really good for the garden. Okay, where do you want me? Just right there is good. Just relax and look natural. Uh, okay, um, try not to think about being photographed. Yeah, but I am being photographed. All right, like this. Something casual. Like that? Yeah. That's great, Mike. What? Do you wanna just talk to me about the garden? Yeah, you're looking really stressed out for somebody that works with plants all day. Just easy, don't get in your head about it. Okay, my job isn't easy. I don't think that's what he meant. Well, I mean, it's kind of easy, right? Okay, it's harder than pointing a lens and pressing buttons, I'll tell you that much. Danny. Well, you've clearly never worked with a camera before. Actually, everyone has a camera on their phone nowadays. Probably makes you feel a little inadequate knowing you have the job level of a third-grader. Hm. And this garden is basically you just digging holes, right? Sorta like caveman stuff? Okay, what's going on here? Okay, you don't think my job is hard? Try planting 50 tree saplings in a row. Gladly! Why don't you put your money where your mouth is? - Are you for real? - Oh, you can't handle it? Oh, I can handle it. Okay, we got 20 saplings ready to go, that's 10 each. Whoever plants them the fastest wins. Holes have to be one foot deep, two feet apart, you got it? No problem. Okay, I can't believe this is happening. Oh. Hi. That's a pretty good physique. One, two, three. Starting to get tired there, Danny boy? I'm just getting started, Mike. Mike. Yes! Woo! Did you see that? Unfortunately, yes. Are you okay? I could use some water. Let's go get you some. I don't know if I'm gonna make it. Might need to lean on you for some support. I'm sure you'll be fine, come on. What? I won! Hello? I'll be right there. Woo! Are you guys okay? Yeah. Never seen this place hit so hard. My power is out. But other than that, I'm fine. Got some work to do. Yeah, let's get to work. You're gonna have to put that purse down, though. Boo. - Hi. - Hey, Liz. How you holding up? Well, I'm doing much better now that you're here. Hm. Are you okay? Yeah. I called, but it went straight to voicemail. Yeah, my phone died. So I called Kate and she said you were here, so, you know, jumped in my car and here I am. Liz, you really don't have to help us. I know I don't have to, but I really want to. Thank you. Are you sure? - Absolutely. - Okay, good. Here you go. Liz, thank you so much. Thank you for coming, thank you for helping, thank you for just being you. Well, there's nowhere else I'd rather be. And just so you know, the gala's not the only thing that I care about. You know, just for your information. Mm-hm. Oh. Have a nice night. All right. Told all the staff to go home. Okay, we'll do the same. Yeah, I'm pretty beat. I guess I'll go back to my dark, powerless home. No you don't. You're crashing with me. Thanks, Liz. Kate, you're headed home too, right? Yes, of course. The place looks amazing. Thank you all for your hard work. - Okay. - Go on. You two have a nice night. Hey. Hey! What happened to going home? Oh. I just said that so Dina would go home and get some rest. Yeah? What about you? You look exhausted. Well, that's something that every woman wants to hear. You trying to say that I need my beauty sleep? No, I'm saying that you've been here all day. So have you. Go home, relax, okay? If you slept through the storm, you're clearly working yourself too hard. Okay, so, don't tell me what to do. Well, stop being so stubborn. Danny, I am too tired to fight right now, and I just need to make sure that everything is right for this walkthrough tomorrow. You should go home, I can lock up. Yeah, like I'm gonna let that happen. You don't think I can do it? I don't think that you should. No fighting, remember? But it's just so easy with you! Come on, what else is on your list? You're really putting in the hours for this gala! But I imagine that you go above and beyond for every event you plan. I do, but this one is extra special. I look forward to the Lord Garden Gala every single year, and I've pretty much been planning it my whole life. When I was a kid, I had this idea of me wearing a beautiful dress and giving a speech in front of everybody, kind of like a mini version of my mom. That's a pretty sophisticated dream for a little kid. Well, I was a sophisticated kid! Yeah? What happened? Funny guy. Your dad must be very proud of you. Yeah. My dad passed away last year. Ah, Kate, I'm so sorry. Thanks. But you're right, he would be proud if he were here. When I was little, he used to take me to the greenhouses for my birthday, till I got a little bit older and then I started celebrating with my friends and making less time for our daddy-daughter trips. Then he started getting me an orchid every year for a birthday present, because he wanted to remind me of our special place. He said that cut flowers were depressing and he wanted to give me something that I could watch grow. That's beautiful. Yeah. Yeah, this is the first year of the gala without him. So all this hard work is as much for your dad as it is for Margaret? Well, it's for me, too. And my little girl dreams. That's a lot of pressure to put on yourself, you know? Yeah. Well, it's the job. You know, I know it's not the same thing, but growing up with William, boy, did my parents have high expectations. William was always the golden boy, and I felt like I've lived in his shadow my whole life. I mean, take this job. I love it and I'm proud of what I've accomplished, but my parents, they don't take my work seriously. But you've done so much, and you're amazing at it. Okay, don't look so shocked. Thank you, Kate, it means a lot, really. I guess, when you come from a family of attorneys, the standards are set pretty high. That must be why you're so good at arguing. Guilty as charged. I can only imagine that it was difficult for William, too, always trying to please your parents. Yeah, I never really thought of it that way. Have you every tried to talk to him about it? Never. Yeah, I've never tried to talk to my mom either. So I guess that makes two of us. You know what? This gala is gonna be amazing. I mean, look at all that you've done. You even have me excited about it, and you know how I feel about fancy parties. Oh, I do, I do. Yeah, I think we've done enough for today. Why don't we go home and get some rest? You're the boss. He finally admits it! Hey. Where were you last night? My dinner at Chez Manon, we waited for you. I called and no one answered. William, I'm so sorry. You forgot. Yeah, but, look, that storm, it hit the garden really hard and I was here all day and almost all night trying to fix it back up. Don't you have people for that? Yeah, but it's my job. I mean, we have this huge gala coming up in a couple of weeks... Danny, you knew how much that dinner meant to me, and you just blew it off! And you canceled on the job interview I set up for you. I never said yes to that. This behavior is not okay. You have to take responsibility for you life. Well, I'm gonna stop you right there. I think that it's time that we have a talk, and I'm gonna ask you to just listen to me, okay? Really listen. Can you do that? Okay. Okay. The stage is over here, as you can see, with access from here and here. And everything is, of course, very protective of the environment. Hmm. The solar-paneled lights are all charged up and ready for action. I know they're a bit different than ones that you've used in the past, but they're actually smaller, which is better for the footprint of the event. I see. Katherine? What's going on? None of this was okayed by me. It was in all of those emails. And every time we met, all of our meetings kept getting cut short. So it's my fault that you've changed every detail of my event? I made it perfectly clear that I wanted everything to stay the same. This is sustainable and it's new. It's a fresh take on the gala and the garden. Now you sound like him. Danny? I mean, he's right. You've always had a problem asserting yourself. Don't be bullied by that man, you're the boss. You're not even listening to me. Wasn't this my chance to put my stamp on things? What happened to your faith in me? There's a stamp and there's completely overwriting years of history. Ready, ladies? Yes. All right, ladies, beautiful garden, we love this fact. We're happy, the sun is shining. Little bit closer to each other, like we love each other. There we go. Right. You're happy to be here. Right? Uh, Kate, maybe a more relaxed smile, okay? It's all right, don't overthink it. Don't get in your head, okay? Let's do it. What's going on over there? Oh. That doesn't look good. No. Okay. All right. Okay, how about we take a break, yeah? Shake off the jitters? Okay. All right. Guilty as charged. We both have O blood, maybe we can do something with that. For sure, yeah. What's going on? What do you mean? With the photographer. We're friends. Please tell me there's nothing going on between you two. I need you to be clear-eyed on this event, not flirting with staff, especially him. You hired him! There's something about him I just don't trust. Oh, maybe it's because he's staff. I cannot believe you right now. You have ignored me and my phone calls and emails for the past two weeks, and I'm doing you a favor and planning this event at the last second. And now you're concerned about who I'm flirting with? You are being judgmental, closed-minded, and hypocritical. I have been solely focused on this event. I eat, sleep, and breathe the gala. You have been somewhere else. You know, I don't know what it is, but I would bet my left arm that you're the reason why Kate's upset. Whoa, protective much? Maybe you should try minding your own business. Okay. I need everyone to calm down right now. You have surpassed my level of stress. We're in all in big trouble. What happened? I just berated my mom in public two days before her gala. What's wrong with me? Hey, it's good that you stood up for yourself. She didn't ask for your advice. And she wasn't asking for yours. That's true. Surprise. Happy almost gala day. Did I miss something? Hey! I'm so sorry I've been ignoring your calls, I just haven't been okay since yesterday. We have to talk. What's this? That is a list of demands from Margaret of all the changes that need to be implemented ASAP or else she'll pull the gala from the garden. It's tomorrow. Yeah, and she's also threatening to go to the Board of Directors to tell them about my behavior during all of this. Your behavior? Yeah, I don't know, you tell me. But between the publicity of losing the gala the day before the event and Margaret Lord herself talking to the people who hired me, I guarantee you I won't have my job for long. Okay, let me look through this. Surely something can be worked out. She's threatening to have me fired. I don't see how a compromise can be made. You actually agree with this ultimatum? Of course not. So you'll go to your mom and you'll talk to her and you'll tell her to back off? Look, I was really angry yesterday, so I completely understand where you're coming from. But it looks like she just wants things to go back to the way they were. We may just need to take our plans off the table. You would do that? After all that time that we spent together, all the planning and hard work? I don't want to, but I think it may be our best option. If we give in this time, then by the time the gala rolls around next year, she'll be more open to changes. Kate, that is not a compromise, that is giving in to your mom's demands. You're simplifying something that's much more complicated. My mom is not just some lawyer, she runs the largest fashion magazine in the world! Cut her some slack! I am so sick of hearing how important Margaret Lord is. You're important, too, Kate. Are you really not gonna stand up for yourself? What about you? You're bulldozing me right now, coming in here with your demands, wanting things your way and only your way? Is that what you think I'm doing? I thought that we were... What? Maybe we don't know each other like I thought we did. Maybe we don't. Where are you going? You've clearly made up your mind, okay? Don't let me get in the way. If Margaret pulls the gala, then we both lose. I'm done arguing with you. Danny, it's a compromise. No, it's giving up! Kate. I'm glad you're here. Is your phone turned off or something? Why, is this about my mom? And you. Tell her. Yeah, so I found out from a friend at another paper that Mike submitted a nasty article about you and your mom complete with details of your fight yesterday. He was taking pictures of that. Okay. This is the icing on this horrific cake. When do these go to print? Tomorrow. I've already called my contacts to see if we can get this thing pulled. The Lord name means something in this town, and we'll use it to stop whatever this is. Yeah, I'll call around as well. Even though my connections aren't as strong as yours. Thank you. Thanks, Liz. Don't thank me yet. Are you kidding? You are the reason why we know about this. You are always saving the day around here, and don't think I haven't noticed. Kate, what do you need me to do? Nothing, business as usual. We're going to act like nothing is going on, just focus on the event. Okay. Liz, will you forward me that email? Yeah, sure thing. Thank you. Where are you going? To talk to my mom. Okay. And this'll be published tomorrow? Unless we can stop it, yes. I am so sorry, my love. You're sorry? Everything you said yesterday was spot on. I haven't been focused on this event, instead putting everything off on you and Dina. It isn't fair, both as the person who hired you and as your mom. I, um... wow, thank you for saying that. If I had been there, I could've... You could have stopped the changes that me and Danny were making, I know, I saw the list. No, I could have really listened to you and your great ideas. It's just, since losing your father, I wanted this gala to be a reminder of all the time we had together. But every time I tried to focus on it, it was simply too painful. And any change you made just felt like you were erasing memories I had made with him. I had no idea. How could you? I never discuss these things with you. I realize now that I had been overreacting, clinging on to something that isn't anymore. You've done a wonderful job with this event. You should be very proud of yourself. I am very proud of you. Really? Yes! I always am! Look what you've been able to accomplish all with the disadvantage of having me as your mother. How could you even say that? Having you as my mother is one of the things that I'm most proud of. I just have some big shoes to fill. Some really great shoes, but big shoes. Whenever all of this is over, why don't we take some time away, just you and I? We can put work behind us and go visit some of the places that Dad liked the most. I would love that very, very much. Terrible that it took this smear campaign to help me realize I was... What was the word? Difficult. Unbearable. Really. By the way, it's a horribly written article. That man should stick to photos. Well, he did manage to capture an amazing action shot of me completely berating you. Really sorry about that, by the way. I have no idea what that means for you and for Lord Magazine. Oh, please don't worry about that. I've been through much worse. It's you I'm worried about, you and that big heart of yours. You seemed more friendly with him. Yes and no. But it's not him that I'm worried about. I've been spending more time with Danny lately. You have? Yeah. It was, uh... well, it's... Why don't you tell me about it? Okay. Hi! I just got done talking to my mom and everything is still on. I told her how I felt. You were right. Danny, I am so sorry. I completely understand if you don't want to talk to me, but I hope that you'll call me back. I would really, really love it if you would call me back, okay? Um... okay, bye. So yeah, it was good working with you guys! And five, thank you so much, bye-bye! Five and bye-bye. How you feeling? Hey! Good. Have you looked online? Absolutely not. The only thing that I've checked today is the weather app, and the only thing I care about is clear skies. That's the spirit! Have you checked? No! No. If it's out there, it's out there. There's no sense in stressing about it now. Very Zen of you. I know, right? Hey. Oh, you look amazing! Oh, thank you. But guess what. What? They didn't run it. Yeah, they pulled the story. Oh, are you kidding me? Uh-uh. How? I don't know, my source doesn't know. The editor just decided to scrap it. Oh, my God, it doesn't even matter at this point. It's gone, that's all that matters. This is a happy moment. Be happier, I need you to be happier! No, I am. I'm relieved both for us and my mother especially, but do you know why? After being lied to by Mike, I'm just waiting for the other shoe to drop. No, it's over, Kate, it's over. If it doesn't run today, it won't run. I mean, it wouldn't make any sense! Yeah, I agree. You have nothing to worry about. Okay, well, thanks for everything, Liz. Oh. I'll be right back. Okay. So you look pretty amazing yourself. Oh, this old thing? Mhm. You know, actually, I was thinking about a career change. Oh, really? Yeah, um, I just recently learned about this thing called event planning, and I think... I think I'd be really good at it. I think I could put you in touch with someone. Oh. You look... wow. Thank you. Do you think the headset compliments my outfit? Didn't even notice it. You know, I never thanked you for coming back early and making sure to be here for my big event. Of course, Kate. I care about you. I care about you, too. So I think that... We should prob... Let me. Sure, okay. George, I think that we should go back to being friends and just friends. I'm so sorry, I just don't think that it's right for me to feel this way and not tell you. Actually, Kate, I think I feel the same way. I really enjoy spending time with you. Me too! But we're just not it, right? Right. I'm so glad that you feel the same way. I just... I felt so guilty after everything you did to get rid of that story about my mom. What? Wasn't that Liz? Uh, no, I thought it was you. I wish I could take the credit, but unfortunately, I had no pull. Hmm. I wonder how it happened then. Or didn't happen. I'm as in the dark as you. Hey, Kate? Go enjoy your party. Mom, you look beautiful. Ugh. I don't think I would've picked that out for you. It's absolutely perfect. You have sublime taste, my dear. Thank you. I may have inherited that from my mother. Oh, it's time for your speech. No, it's your time. You've got this, my love. Gather around, everyone! Gather around. Thank you all for coming out and celebrating such an amazing cause. "There is no one like Margaret Lord." I've heard that my entire life. But I didn't really know what that meant until recently. My mother is amazing at so many things, but what she's best at is love. My parents taught me that the most important thing that you can pass on in this world is love, and that's exactly what we're doing here tonight. We're passing on a better world to the next generation. I'd like to thank the head of operations here at the garden, Danny Miller, for all of his hard work that made tonight's dream possible. Again, thank you for celebrating Lord Magazine. A toast to the singular Margaret Lord. Margaret! Love you, Margaret! Love you, Margaret. Oh. Oh! Hey! Hey. I wanted to give you the perfect gift for tonight, but, you know, my usual florist was hit hard by the storm, so I drove to a different one and, well, I got a little lost, I'm not ashamed to admit that. You're here. An orchid for you. Congratulations, Kate Lord. Thank you. It's just a flower. No, thank you for everything. I know it was you who got rid of that terrible story about me. I don't know how you did it... Wait, how did you do it? Well, I might've had a helping hand. Yeah, but how did you even know about it? I overheard Dina when I was leaving the office that day. So I met with Mike and we spoke, which by the way is not easy with that guy. I told him that if he ever wanted a shot with the best girl in the world that he'd have to do the right thing. And that worked for you? Not at all. So I took a page out of your mom's playbook and I got William to call Mike's boss. Between you and me, he didn't technically do anything illegal, but no paper wants to be caught up in a lawsuit with my brother on the opposing counsel. You called your brother for me. Eh, it was for the gala. Of course it was for you. That must've been hard. Well, things are different between us now. I took your advice, and we've come to an understanding. Oh, you actually listened to me and did something I suggested. There's hope for you yet, Mr. Miller. So, uh, so where's George? Oh, he's around here somewhere. I see. We had a serious talk, and we decided that it's best for us to just be friends. Really? Really. And you and Mike... Mike. Mike. Hmm. Sorry, it's not ringing any bells. So you're unattached? Not exactly. There's this one guy that I'm interested in, and he tells really bad jokes and he never watches where he's going. Can he rock a pair of khakis? You know it. I think I know just the guy for you. Oh, yeah. Well, there's one more thing, and this is essential. Okay, what's that? He has to drive me absolutely crazy. Oh, he can definitely do that. Yeah, is that a promise?
