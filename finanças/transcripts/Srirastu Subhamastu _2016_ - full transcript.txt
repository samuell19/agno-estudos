Forgive me dad, we both loved each other. As you may say no if I tell you… I had been saying brother in law. What is your profession? Business sir I too do business sir. There would be types and what is yours? Readymade dresses show room. Do you know this matter before? I have been saying no… Not about the marriage happened today. Do you know about the love between these from long back? Even known, you do not say this is wrong, where are you and where are we? Total family should settle in one shot, right? As both were liking each other… All we like cannot be ours, we are middle class and should think so. You should say so. Did you not understand? You and I go to Tirupati. You and I will have the Darshan. But I see God from so close. I think this one example is enough to get the difference between us. I am there for you to say great as to whom you gave your daughter. What shall I say? Sir.. I brought up my daughter well in what I had sir. Then you should get a match in what you had. Come, there is a meeting. Dad, I wanted to say… Please, you do not speak anything. You have the right to bring that girl home as your wife. But for me, she can never become my family member and cannot become too. Please daddy. Tulasi, say that girl never to come in front of me. Good morning dear. Coffee! Mr Raju! Sir! Give those binoculars here. Mr Raju! Sir Any water problem in city? No sir, why? One or two parts may be good in any girl. But what is she, all parts are good. Is it because of the weather or is she really a beauty? Weather too is a bit reason sir. Then, it would be great seeing such a beauty from closer. Move then. No, she is missed Mr Raju. Mr Raju, why do you not try too? It is very good. I cannot bend as much as you sir. I do not mind whatever you think. Find out her details. I liked her. Sir, you will have to come next week again. You got to speak with farmers in the valley. Sure Mr Raju Are they positive? Yes, totally positive sir Where did the sound come from? Mr Raju, where did she come from? May be fell slipping while trekking sir. Is she dead or what? Pick her up sir, we shall see. Hello! Hello! Sir! What are you doing? I am giving her breathe Mr Raju. Why all that for us sir? They would do that if joined at hospital. Check whether pulse exists or not. Why is no sound coming at all? You do not need to keep the head there to check pulse sir. You can check even by catching the hand. It is beating Mr Raju. Mr Raju, why is it happened so for such a good girl? Sir, we talked that she is beautiful but still not whether is good or bad. Mr Raju, those so close with nature would in general be very sensitive. Ok sir, it is time for the flight. Move on. What, leaving her so? Sir, she is just some tourist and we joined her in hospital. Why all these for us? Let us go, come. What, just tourist? I am not feeling so. Something more between us… Sir! It is time to check in. Please move. Yes, he is caught. Madam i will go out. No problem...Your her husband right! No.. I am not her husband. Not her husband. We can think if we dashed into sir. The girl fell from top Keep it sir, I will send her off. and the bill will come so much sir. Mr Raju! Sir! What is that nurse, said us as husband and wife? She would have said not knowing sir. Hey, it is good. It is a pleasure for heart to listen. Crazy You are not understanding Mr Raju, how happy would she feel knowing we saved her life. Excuse.. yes. A girl came yesterday to room number 103 from trekking accident. We discharged her. Friends of her came and took her. Do not feel bad sir. Nature and the girls are the same. They go on doing what they feel. We feel a lot to have liked those. Please Mr Raju! Sir, Excuse me! Where have you been sir? That girl waited a lot to meet you. She felt very sad to be leaving without meeting you. You should have 10 minutes early sir. Her friends took her away as they were getting late for the flight. She gave a letter to hand you over. Forgive me, as I could not meet you. My parents gave me the birth and you gave me a rebirth. I will pray for you to be good every time I pray to God. Sir, secretary called. Name is Ananya. Hyderabad is the native place and is doing Engineering in Vizag Geethams College. What, Hyderabad girl? Yes sir. It cooperates so to those who cooperate. Ok Mr Raju, see you. Sir! All the best Thank you Mr Raju Oh, it is good. Shimla, Kashmir and Ooty tours. Shall we not understand what we and our life are? Father sent and the daughter just goes so. Hey, do not speak nonsense. If you do not like, say. I and my dad will get out from the house. Where to? Ok, go dear. What is this nuisance early in the morning? Yes, a nuisance. Her studies would be done after two months and she should be married. You do not think of it. But always say your daughter is great. Come on, you are a crazy lady. She is a Princess. Will some Prince not come on a horse and take her away? He will, what is there to? If he really comes on a horse and say to take her, you have no money to even feed that horse. Leave, she keeps talking something. God knows about taking on horse, but you got to make her travel in train in the evening. Do you have money? What baby, are you leaving? Stay for four more days. Climate is changed now from cities right? How if you catch cold or fever again? It is last semester and should not miss classes dad. Ok, get ready then. While going I will visit uncle and family and then get you over the train. How is mom ? She is fine. Hey, need to pay term fees for Anu. Yes, correct How much did we pay last time? One lakh rupees Need seventy thousand extra this time. Some I Phone 6 has come and all are using that. Anu still has the old phone. She will have that inside, but will not say seeing my condition. I feel jealous seeing you. Having money and growing kids are different. I gave word to my wife while she died to bring up my Anu without any low feel. We will eat or no, but cannot bear if she gets any insult or less respected being daughter of a middle class man like me. Hey, why will you get that situation when I am here? I will send accountant. With this I owe seven and a half lakhs to you. I will slap if you talk again about accounts. Hey, who else do we have than Anu? Yes, but… Shut up Very good place. You and uncle go once aunty. Be quiet, Anu will feel bad listening. What else dear? Are you studying well? Super uncle. Good What next? Should think aunty. Should find some job in Campus placements and plan for further studies. We will start then. Should get Anu onto the train. I will carry. No problem dear. What is taking so long, let us go in? My goodness, where to go? None other than students and their parents can go in. I called last year student union President Krishna. He said to stay at the gate and he would send a guy. Why ? This college is very strict dude. We cannot handle. Look, there he comes. See, I think he is the one. Hi bro! - Hello! It seems you called Krishna bro saying some love problem? Who is the boy? I am Sirish. He looks fine. What boy? It seems you came off from Kashmir leaving aside the business. You should not react to everything seen. You will be gone. All girls would be seen beautiful in this age. Idiot.. Do not speak so bro. My guy is short tempered. I tried to correct when the boy was going wrong. Will we not get anger? If the rich gets angry, it is extra qualification and is an extra defect if we get. Hey Majunu, come. You walk bloody. Here stays all the B Tech students. Where is your girl? What are you seeing me? Look there. Where is your girl? what is this for us? He said to have seen in Kashmir and again in the college this morning. He is looking that way. Is that the girl? He is eating whatever she eats, drinking whatever she drinks. What is this for us? What do you know about them? They are feelings. Feelings and my foot! They come when expressed and buried when pushed in. She should know either you feel or sing songs, right? Say bro, she is in final year and would be gone in two months. Ask him to go and say what he is feeling. Go bro!- Go dude. I am tensed bro. Goooo... It will be tension now and happy later when the girl comes. Then you get married and later pregnancy… Steps are those, right? Not staring in anger for all. Lecturer would come, go. Go! Come on go bro.- Go dude.- God is there. Why is he so fearing? What has he come to do? Looks like got it hard. Why did she hit so bro? Eating like pigs in hostel, studying on scholarships… And you say I love you by seeing girls. No single penny in pockets, but you need love. Look Anu, money is needed for grooming, but why for love? What bloody, giving me counters? Tell now... telll... Is there any relation to the slow motions you showed yesterday and this beating? How dare you to propose me? Looks like the girl is obedient. Nice selection! All the best. See you! Hey, not that dude… What no, bloody? You feel life is a game? Or you want to eat away? Will you say bloody? Do you say that as beating? You too be careful. You are finished today. What will you do now dude? What dude, looking like real pick pocketers? Real pickpocketers dude. What now? They go and pick her handbag now. You go and hit these when that girl is watching. You want to get close to her so? You and your bloody faded ideas… Hey!- What? See, how is that guy beating them up. You bloody, come! Who are you? - Who is it? Why are you hitting them like that? Leave bloody. What is this? Why are you hitting them? Your foot madam, I am just hitting them to clean my itch. Why are you hitting then? Have they picked your purse or your chain? Yes, they picked my purse. Hey, do not overact. Oh no, they really picked my purse. You should complain Police if purse is picked. What, Police complaint? What name and place should I give when they ask? Say your name. Yes, ask my name. What is your name? Ask my place madam. Which place? Come on sir, is it like you lost everything by losing a purse? Will they not? Ok, say number of your dad. That is…; Say without seeing That is, I did not remember as it is fed in the phone. Right? My situation too is the same. As everything was in that card, I did not remember anything. Take! My entire identity is gone because of your deed. This society will not accept me now. My position now is like Surya from Ghajini and Vikram from I. I lost my identity. All because of your one foolish act. Be ready to face the consequences. Anything may happen and it may go any far. You got to groom me from now. There is no other way for you and no other option for me. Careful madam. Sir, please. I have not done anything knowingly. I tried stopping when something was going wrong in front of my eyes. Did I say? Did I say that you did wantedly? You go coolly and concentrate in the class. I will wait here in the canteen. Let us meet in the evening, discuss and work out something. Ok, do not worry. Sister, take the girl. Please!- Go!- Oh no! Hey Swapna!- What? That boy is still here. Hey, where? Let us sit once, talk and settle the matter. What to settle? I did not understand anything what he spoke. Did you understand? No!- Then shut up and come. No, problem may come again. Nothing like problem, come. Not that…- Come on. Vizag means beaches till now. Going ahead beautiful Araku and Kailasagiri. We know just this. In the recent times, terrorist movements are growing in such a peaceful city. Police have taken a boy seen doubtful in front of Geetham College gate in to custody today. What doubt, man? That is true. He is terrorist. Sir, is he alone or anybody else? He says another girl is there. We shall arrest even her. Sir, do you know any details of that girl? We are taking him to know the same. We will close down that girl by morning, wherever she is. Move, none can save these now.- Why did he trap me so? Cool it, nothing would happen. Why do you say nothing happens, you fatty! Madam! After you said me to wait at College, they brought me and pushed here saying Alkhaida and terrorist. Will you kill her or what? Leave. What to do you know madam? Hey! Leave that girl. Leave! Do you know him? Yes, I know sir. Actually asked him to wait at the gate. I forgot and left. He is like a brother in relation to me. Sorry sir, I have no sisters. I do not know who this girl is. Hey, are you gone mad? What if not? What is brother like no other relation exists in the world? I hate brother and sister relationship between us? What is that murmuring? Look, you say you know him and that boy says no. Are all of you from same batch? How many are you in total? From where did you come into this city? No sir Promise sir, no! Push these all in. I know him sir, I know him. Actually he is not brother, but said in tension. Then? My friend sir. Friend! Oh friend? This is my ID card sir. Geetham College, Robotic science! Sir, any problem contact me. Hey, why did you say my name? This is too good. I lost my identity all because of your one foolish act. I am reminding you this fact. I do not remember anything except you. My mind is blocked. I am like a white paper. Oh no, why are you behind me so? Hey, what shall we do with him? Srinu fellow is correct for him. We will put him in his room. He will arrange all the lost cards. Your problem too would be solved. Will he let him in?- What are you saying? We both are lovers. We both are deeply in love. Oh no, who is that idiot loving even this lady? What is this nonsense of losing purse and the identity? He would say to have lost anything when one listens. Please Srinu, why do you not help? This is not help, but my responsibility. She is frightened to death. World always frightens those who fears. There is Indian Penal Code. That has sections, clauses, flats, flours and all. How if you do not have minimum common sense? What is Police arresting him for standing outside the College? Where is he?- He is outside. Move, I thought something else when you came to my room at this time. What dear, have you come to play as they look cute and innocent? Hello, why are you seeing there when I am talking here? Hello, you! Why are seeing around? What is this? You said friend, room and shelter. Is friend not in room? Has he gone out? Oh, you have great satires within. You do not listen the words then. Oh no! Look bro, you felt like to lift hands when I did not bother you for a second. These have made my life without identity. How much should I feel? Correct dude, there is the pain. Do one thing. My friend is in RTO office. You will get license by tomorrow afternoon. You will get Aadhar and Pan cards in two, three days. What name shall get on those? I do not know. What is the name of your father?- No idea. What do you mean? You want me to do all functions like birth, education and bring you up and then get all these cards for you? Why is he shaking head? When did you come?- It is just 10 minutes baby. Did you have breakfast?- Yes, I had. No problem, you can have again. Come let us go to the canteen. We will go for sure, but after meeting the HOD for once. Why, you want to know whether there are any complaints on me? Checking, what?- Yes, checking. Shut up and come. It feels very happy to listen when someone says great about children. I meet HOD every time I come to listen to that. If not what is checking on you than to be crazy? You are really a crazy man, dad. When I was so small, God cheated me by taking away my dad. I lived for my mom. Your mom cheated by putting you in my hands and dying after marriage. I lived for you. You are my only hope. If anything happens with you… There will not be any strong reasons for me to be alive. What dad? Nothing dear. I had big blows every ten to fifteen years in life. I seem confident out but have some fear haunting so deep inside. Why do you fear? I am there, right? No baby! Come, I am feeling hungry. Let us go and eat something. Come, let us eat. Come. Ok baby, I will leave now. Here, I bought you something and forgot. Dad, why all these now?- Shut up! Should my daughter not use when all are using? Wow dad, awesome.- Did you like?

Do not touch towels and bed sheets at will, I hate. Is rice coming from village? - What? Is rice coming from village? Come, you arrived at the right time. His pain too is similar to me. It is too difficult to live in this world without identity. Your identity is found.- Do not joke. This was found in your bag. This is your international driving license. This is the pilot training flying hours you have at the US aviation academy. This is the ID card of your MBA completed last year at the Stanford University. All these are your unlimited Credit cards of all international banks. Give them here. Hey, who is this boy? He looks just as me. - Yes, right? I too felt the same. Ask Anu once as to what she feels.

Please wait. Hey, move.- Listen to me once. I will not listen.- Swapnika, please. Do one thing. Bring a bit bigger one, it would be good. Shut up! Lakshmi! What if not mom, saying bad sight and black magic even these days. Ok, you slimmed down. Are you on diet? - No- Do not diet. Hi!- Hi dad. How are you?- Fine dad. Ok, it is old style if I say bad sight. Is anyone falling on the feet of father even these days? Mom! He is precious and he is my hero. Ok, he is hero and me? He is hero means you are heroine, right? - Oh my God. Wow, once chance comes, you father and send take great services. What is up? All good? When did you come? I just came dude. I came to meet sister in law immediately after I arrived. What sister in law? Fine? What dude, brought saying important news? I am in love with a girl. I know you get tensed so by saying. I still remember the disturbance taken place regarding marriage of brother But do not worry, I will make dad accept and then marry. Rupa, only daughter of Mahendar uncle. Dad recently met in a function and gave them word. He is thinking to get you married in the next two to three months. What son, will you not think before loving? Will you not see whether they fit for us or not, they are wealthy enough or not and all such? What will love know status dad? Should know son. Son of a rich man when asks for a car will not ask for a Nano. He would ask for a sports car worth two and two and a half crores. Shirt worth fifty thousand, pant worth a lakh… We buy all those happily, because they are in our range. Coming finally to the marriage matter, it is so. They bring in unworthy people. Dad, what all you said are to show what we are to the world. But marriage, it is a personal choice. It is for our happiness, right dad? What being happiness? Do you think those who love and come behind come seeing you? But seeing your status and wealth. Boys like you when go and propose to a middle class girl, they definitely accept. Because they do not see you but your property. That is the middle class mentality today. What they need is not love, but life security for them and their family. It is a trap. When asked, they say to have brought their daughter up good in what all they have. If was brought up so, what is the name? What is the name of that girl? Who dad? The same, whom you brought and dropped in here. Sandhya dad. Yes It is been five years since she came to this house. I have not talked to her even a single day. I do not even know how she really is to me. If she was brought up so, should leave this house in shame and insult, right? Why is she not going? At least, has her dad come and taken? No! Security for them if she is here. Hey, to become overnight Billionaire they say this Cricket, Cinema and politics in our India. Not all these, but marriages like this. Dad, you are thinking very wrong. Not all girls are so. 150 out of 100 girls are like that. Ok dad, if that girl really loves by seeing property and not me, I do not want her. I am not understanding what you say, come again. I am not your son from today. I will go as a middle class boy and love that girl. It is ok for you if she loves me so, right? That will not happen Sirish. If it does not happen, I will marry the girl you say. What will you do if lost? There will not be win or lose in this dad. Will come with her if I win or learn life and come if I lose. I anyhow have to win love of Anu. Thus I lied so. If Anu loves me after knowing who I am, I cannot love her anyways. Daddy will not accept Anu. I cannot take any decision without the acceptance of my dad. No dude, there are honesty and values in your journey. You will succeed for sure. Thanks for accepting. Hey, you ate about 15 Dosas in the evening. You just ate a family pack Biryani. What are all these again? What if I feel hungry in the midnight? Madam! Oh no, think it is that idiot. Go and open the door. Once I rest, will not get up even if there is a thunder storm. Go and open yourself. Have you slept so fast? Oh God!- Hello madam Madam! What? Thought could sleep with you given a chance. What bloody? That was not my intension. To sleep in your room given a place. I feel afraid outside to sleep alone. Are you gone mad? Do not have stupid ideas. Go, get lost. Madam, you are mistaking me. I am 24, still virgin. Ghosts are haunting when I am closing my eyes. No idea what is in the house? You are a big ghost. Another ghost to threaten you? Get lost. Madam, please. Let me in, I am frightened. Get lost, no! See now. Hello, your dad is Police right? Madam, please Madam please, I beg you. Understand and let me in madam. I cannot sleep alone madam, please. Madam, I beg you. It will be kind to let me in. It's ok let him come in and sleep.. Where will he sleep? On my head?- Please understand madam. Yes. There will be a way out when there is a will. Show these over ideas in life. You will at least get food. Hello, change this pose please. It is difficult here. Hello, this is more difficult.- Oh no! This is a bit better. Can manage. Hello!- Bloody, if you do not sleep calm will chop you into pieces. Come on, what is this? Why are you always so frustrated? I get a doubt seeing you. Have you loved anyone? At least liked? You! Nothing, thinking what qualities should be there for you to like. Should not surely be like you. Leave it, we too will get better days. Someone would like and love me too. They would change and make into useful guy. I see. I want to see that unlucky girl. If someone really loves you, I would spoil that myself. Hey, stop it now. Will you make him sleep by chatting the whole night? Shut up and sleep now. You bloody Idiot! Both his legs should go dead. Ok, thank you. Oh God, This is enough for today.. We got to submit today, last day! - We will submit. Hello... Where? Where are you going so by dressing up? Is this the respect? Is this the tradition? Is this the way to take care of the guest at home? What is your nonsense? Is my vain seen to you as nonsense? Have you lit the lamp waking up in the morning? No! Time is almost 10, no breakfast and no tea. What the hell is happening in this house? Upma is there in that hot pack, eat. Lunch then? Sir, eat that first. That should digest and then is the lunch right? We will set something by then. Ok? What are saying mom? The girl is like a diamond. She got up early in the morning, had head bath and filled the house with holy smoke. I am not feeling like at home. But like in Shiridi, Tirupati or Kashi. Whole house is like Annamayya climax. You will like her a lot mom. She, her obedience, respect and tradition. Wow! She is prepared Upma before leaving to college and is great. Think she put ghee, it is just sticking putting in the mouth. Is it sticking? It would melt by putting ghee and will not stick. Ghee in Vizag is so mom. What else? Is sister in law fine? Sir!- Yes- Work is done and am leaving. - Ok, leave Ok, is dad taking food in time. Ask him to..Sir What? Madam said Upma is on the table and asked to take it. Is this for you? Yes sir. Thought to take yesterday morning, but left as they would come and have in the evening. Taking yesterday mean, when did they do this? They cooked the day before night sir. Mom, hang the phone. I will just call you back. Ok sir, have it. You or I is ok. Wash the dishes after eating and keep inside sir. I will come in the evening. Should not believe anyone these days. We shall cook what we need and eat. Come, eat. Enough sir. I already ate 40 to 50 Dosas. Eat! Food given to poor and workers will go nowhere. Are Dosas good?- Good sir. What is your name?- Rangamma sir Rangamma, I wrote a story. Will you listen? What is that sir? There a rich boy in a place.- Ok He loved a middle class girl.- Ok His dad knowing it said no as they love rich for money but not seeing the heart. But that boy challenged to go as a poor guy, Enter her life and win her love. Will he win at last? Who is that crazy fellow sir? No girl these days will love anyone without money. He would lose. You bloody, you say he would lose. Will he lose bloody? Say that he wins. Say he wins. Will he lose?- No! Hey, what are you doing? See madam. He said some story and asked to say the climax. He is burning so for saying anti-climax. What bloody, why are saying complaints? I will teach you a lesson, wait. She is a big writer and will say us the climax again. You ate all the served 40 Dosas and again will not support me? You get fresh and I will bring preparing the Dosas. Hey, are these what you do for your age? Preparing Dosas, chatting with maid… Do you not feel shame? Hey Swapna, will you eat Dosas? I am always ready. Sit, I am coming. Wow, it gets exciting by nights. You are down and I am on top. Bloody, if you do cross talking will break your legs. Madam, everything I talk sounds wrong as you are thinking wrong. I was just being casual. You are down on bed and I am on the top over the net. Oh no, how if everything is taken as double meaning. Hi dad. How far have the exams come? Only practical exams are left. And they announced marks in five subjects and I am the topper. Anu, you came class first? You have not said. Shut up! Hello Who, sounds like some gent voice? Son of the watchman dad. He came to ask as he had some doubts in maths.

Ok dad, I am coming. What is this suddenly dad? Hi Anu Hi uncle, hi Aunty! Fine? I am fine What are you all here suddenly? Nothing dear, our Arun is got a good match in the city. They brought to see and muhurat is at 1:30. As there was still an hour left, your aunt wanted to see you and we came so. Did Arun said to marry? We had come as he hurried. Nice. Then Aunty will be getting a good company. It is time dear. We got to go for seeing the match, right? What more matches dude? They are done. We have come to see this dearest one. If I ask the same in Hyderabad, what will you say? Where are you, where am I, what is your status and what is our status… Can we equalise with you and you say all such poor dialogues. Thus to make you both sit and talk, I decided and brought here. Exams too are getting over for Anu, right brother? We will fix dates in 10 to 15 days if you say ok. What do you say? Only if you like. What are you saying dude? You are taking care of me from childhood with more liking than a brother and responsible as a father. You gave us so much even without asking. Giving such a big boon, why do you ask like some wish? They say we get the chance to pay the debt of this life in this life only with great luck. When we got such a chance, how will we let that go? What baby? Will you marry our Arun? Wrong dear. You brought her up without getting to know the absence of mother. Any girl would fear to suddenly go to in laws house. But why fear to come to your house which is like her own house? There, she is getting into tears too in happiness. Ok dude. Is it only to you and sister or even Arun likes? You said great. He is come and is waiting from yesterday in Vizag. Fearing where would Anu reject. There, he is come. Hi daddy, hi Anu! Mom! Love you Hello uncle! Hey, uncle is doubting whether you like this proposal or not. Anu! Yes I like you very much from childhood. I thought to say you many times. Thinking where you would think I am taking advantage, I never said that. Anyhow, finally you made my day. I am so lucky today. We are so lucky. Yes mummy, we are lucky Thank you Anu. My lucky baby. Hello, where is the priest? I need to go for a worship. He is gone for lunch and will be back in half an hour. Anu! Many thanks Anu. You are the best thing that happened in my life. There are many things I should say you. Come, let us go. One minute.- Come, let us go. - Yes, we will go. How is work? Work? It is fine. Why, any complaint? Nothing. Be careful and do the work well. Do not waste time. You can say these even later Anu. There are many things I need to say you. Come. Siri, I cannot say all these to you again. Maybe this is the last time we are meeting. In Vizag? Siri, this is the problem with you. You take nothing serious. Ok, I am serious. I am very serious, say. I am leaving back home. Stop all these girls and roaming around. Will you stay calm if I? From now either roam or do whatever, it is only with you. Siri please, do not unnecessarily keep hopes. I do not like you and I came to say that. Anu, do not talk so even for fun. I cannot take it. Oh no! How would you believe me? I promise on you. I do not like you. Good bye. Please Anu, why do you leave so when I am talking? This is not you. You are gone mad. Why do you leave when I am talking? What to talk? I said, right? Anu! I need you. You are very important for my life. Why do you leave when I am talking? Say what happened? At any chance, I will not leave you. To win you is very important to my life Anu. I love you Anu. Hey Siri, no! Nothing happened to you right? Are you ok, Siri! I am Hey Anu! Hi Anu!

Paidipala Gothram. Name?- Sirish Name of better half?- Ananya What is your junior boss saying? What will he do now? He is coming there, you ask him. Why do you ask me for everything? Yes, good morning. Morning dad. What next? Dad! The same, shall I inform Mahendar uncle? For what dad What is for what? Her marriage is fixed, she is not loving you. Simple. She is in love with me dad. You have no shame. The girl called to propose by you, found a better guy and said ok ten minutes ahead. What is love again? Dad, loving me and agreeing for that marriage are different. Do not see both as the same. She could not say anything as the family in support from the childhood brought the proposal. Her daddy too was there and she did not open up with respect on him. Oh, then kids in all houses are listening to their parents. Bloody hell only in this house. You are so confidently saying her to be liking you, did she say you? No dad, I saw in her eyes. She is very positive about that. Everything would be seen positive in bad times. Hello sir! Hello. My name is Siri and am friend of Anu. Yes, tell me. I am dad of Anu. Anu said about her marriage. Correct, but not any sooner as of now. She too said the same. She asked to come ten days in advance as dad cannot do it all alone. Is it? Why do you say so slowly sir? You are the life of Anu. She is ready to do or leave anything for you sir. Believe me, there is no daughter on earth to be loving her dad so much. She is the best sir. Is it? Yes. Look, how much does my baby love me? She puts her life on me. You too are here, have you ever done so for me? If I too was in twenties, should have brought a bunch of such guys and filled the house. Oh no, this old lady is a bit fast. Shut up! What age, that is a matter of good heart. You dumb head, anything in this world is linked to the age. Our lives are so as we did not know this. Son, Anu is in the backyard. Go! Ok Go. Thankyou. Hey look at side.. may be he is anu boy friend. Hey.. Come on.. Hi.. Hey, stop. There is nothing so. Leave now and we will meet again. Bye. Move on Why did you come? What, playing drama? Move. Let us go to some temple, marry and lead our own lives. Move.. Hey, are you gone mad? I do not like you. I said you that day, right? Go from here. Do one thing. Go say the same that I am not your friend to your dad and he will send me away. Dad! You hesitated a moment to call your dad, right? They call this space as love. I am saying with confidence on that love. You would come and say I love you before the third knot is tied. If I really start loving, it is the would be, but not you. I will not upset my dad. What dear? What are you saying upset? That is… Nothing uncle, Anu is upset regarding this marriage. What is it baby? You have not said me She will not and cannot. Because you are her father. I am the best friend. I came here to share all these, right? Anu is very shy uncle, keeps everything in the heart. We got to pull things out. Day before, similarly she called me to temple for saying a good news. I went dressing up well, as she said good news. Ask what she said after I had been there. Daddy, that is… Why are you seeing so? Say, your dad is asking right? Dad, that is me… Nothing sir. Saying how much she loves you and to ask me to come early to help you in the marriage works she made me wait for half an hour. Is it? Yes, daddy Crazy girl! How can you live if you are so shy? You say him best friend and is so jovial. Fun is great if a boy like this is in the marriage. Need energy to make fun, right uncle? Anu, am feeling hungry. Can you prepare something please? Look, boy says hungry and you made him stand so. Take him and prepare something to eat. Ok daddy. Ok, come. Shut up, there is nothing at home. Go out and eat. Any, there is Dosa barter in the fridge. No idea when did that boy last eat, prepare him Dosas. Our life has started now. Move. Hey Anu, have you observed this now? We already walked the seven steps now. That means, we both are husband and wife from this moment. We can do whatever we wish to. Let us rock. Hey, feel free. It is common. Oh no! Bloody idiot! Anu!You are a wow in this dress. We after marriage should at least once in a week in such a dress… Saying to prepare Dosas and eat. Take the plate bloody. Eat! What is this like serving the beggar, Anu? How should I serve then? With love, affection… You know can fill the stomach half with expression. No.. Why do you not say once with so much love from inside? What dude, looking so settled with the marriage in just ten days? I got all the processions written for the auspicious time. I need to take luck of your home to mine as early as possible, right? What, you got them written so fast? Here is the list and we shall follow as per this. No way, is everything your wish? Will you not see whether the vehicle is in condition or not? Not that.. Oh no siri. There is still ten days more and marriage works should start from day after… It will not start How would it start when short circuit happened? Hey Anu, reduce the oil in Dosa. Fat will be formed. Hey, are you any mad? I beg you please. Then say that you like me. No Not that. We will start card distribution from 12th. Call, I will see who would come. Please! don't go that side. I am saying will not move even an inch, right? Hey Anu, make two more and stop, enough. Hey boy, come here. Looks like he got connected. Who are you? I forgot. He is Siri and classmate of Anu. He is father in law of Anu. Hello sir Close friend and Anu asked him to come early as he would be helpful to me. What is the friendship to come ten days early? What are you asking about our friendship sir? It is a big love story. Love story? Love story means it is like a love story. Nothing sir, I had a lover at College. I asked Anu to help in that matter. She said ok, but put condition to help her dad in the marriage works. Okay.. However you talk when alone, do not move so close before others, it does not look good. Who others sir? You? That is… Anu used to say her uncle too is same as her dad. You are saying others and Where are you from? Stop it man leaving aside the main thing. I am dying here in tension. Why tension uncle? Am I not here? I will do the marriage single handed. Give those papers here. Not necessary. I will say a number, note it. 98480… 00… 00… 0 Name? Shyam Sunder. That is he does all the rich marriages like this in twin cities. Say that I have sent. Ok You do not need to depend on any one. See you. Hey! Uncle! Observe him a bit. Ok uncle. Uncle!- Yes We are going out for the first time on marriage works. Good if Anu comes in the way. Anu, come dear. idiot. Hello, excuse me! Is Mr Shyam Sunder in? Sir is taking breakfast, please wait.

It seems sir finished breakfast. He is asking to come in. Sir, may I come in? Hello, come in. Be seated. Hello! Hello, say! Sir, all these marriages? I got them all done. Bunny and Sneha… they approached me first. They asked what to do? I spoke with Aravind sir and father of Sneha and fixed the match. recently gave birth to a boy too. And Charan, Upasana… Why all that? Marriage of Manchu Manoj recently, that was by me. All those were not arranged marriages, That is as you know. Is the marriage agreed by both bride and groom? The bride is not agreeable with marriage. Why? Will you stop by knowing now? Why all these for you sir? Think about how to do the marriage works. The time is already nearing fast. Why are you so tensed? Is this boy the groom? Friend of the bride. Friend Class mate of my daughter sir. She has called for him to be in support to me. Ok, give that timings paper. Actually the coming up 15th date… What is your expected budget? 20 Lakhs sir Not for the looks sir, what is the expected budget for marriage? Marriage budget sir… What is your plan behind doing marriage in such a poor budget? Your account credited with 2.5 Cr? Sir, you just said 20 Lakhs right? I will get this marriage done for free. Why sir? Messages sir, messages are coming so. What messages sir? That is, I have a partner. It seems we promised to do the 100th marriage for free while starting this company. That luckily became yours. Is it? Yes All this is the luck of Anu, Siri. You are great sir. Not a normal is going into a very rich family sir. Sir, you start now. I will talk the rest tomorrow with Koteswara Rao sir. Ok sir, fine. Ok Uncle, you leave home and I will plan everything here and be back. Okay. Boy will stay back; He needs to plan, right? Ye, come on bro. We will speak sipping a drink. Our plan now is… Yes, tell me sir We create different programs on the name of this marriage… And make Anu get close to Arun. Keeping the one in heart before and moving close and romantic with the other is a hell. Automatically either in irritation, in that pressure or with the genuine love on me, Anu would fall out in a weak moment. So, what is our plan from tomorrow? Uniting Arun and Anu. Who will you unite Shayam Sunder? Not uniting, but just make Arun and Anu move close. That is all. Understood, right? Understood sir. Oh no! I unnecessarily went greedy for money. I am stuck. He looks to be a big psycho. Not just him but everyone rich is a psycho. Sarayu! Sir I am in heavy stress, come here once. Siri, come! Why have you brought me here sir? Need to purchase gold and clothes for marriage, right? Wanted to take some money mortgaging the house. What is it sir? You said him best friend. Will they not get marriage done without gold? No sir, this marriage is not needed if it is so Let us cancel it. I will call Shyam Sunder and ask him to stall the work. Hey wait. What is your speed, man? What, is it because they ask? What value will Anu have in their circle, if we do not give gold and clothes to her? Not that anyone would ask but when my baby decorated and sits on the marriage seat… Will two eyes be enough for anyone to witness her beauty? Somehow if I get her married, she will be happy lifelong. We shall sir, we shall see to that she will have nothing less. Let us go. What is this Shyam Sunder? Why these photo sessions, Sangeet and all? Are all these required? That is not …. Shut your mouth. What sir, your only son! How if you do not carry it on such a grand scale? Still, Shyam says all these are for free, right? Even at free, what all these? You stop thinking about all these. Dad, I am going out with Anu. See you in the evening. Hey Arun! Hi.. Hi. How are you, all good? When did you come? Yesterday Hey, you already got the marriage charm. That is like a dream.. Shyam Sunder I said charm and you think it as dream. Get a hold on language. Ok sir Do you know him before itself? Come on dad, Siri… best friend of Anu He is a very nice guy. Ok Siri, let us rock in the marriage. Sure bro Then you say, we need to do nothing and come like all to the marriage. No sir, you should do. You need to be along and give a letter in Police station. Because we need to take permission for none to object for the sound pollution we create. Why do we need all these Police permissions. Police keep waiting for marriages at the rich houses. We shall take permission for sure. Maybe Koteswara Rao sir does not know about Police. Who is he man, looking like Bahubali 5? Shyam, this is my cousin Subhash and is an encounter specialist. He is uncle of Arun. He was at Vijayawada in the combined state and now deployed in Hyderabad after bifurcation. He is Shyam Sunder. What does you do? Marriage planner. Yes, the marriage planner. Why are you saying marriage is free? Here, eat the eggs. No sister You are going slim dear, have them. Hey, have I not said no? Go inside. Why do you scold when I am asking with love? He killed 150 in this anger. No idea when it goes down. Here. Why are you saying free? That is, they fixed to do the 100th marriage free when they started the company sir. Luckily it is of our Arun. Exactly Who are you? Friend of Anu, my name is Sirish Yes, Sirish Which is the native place? Ours is Andhra Pradesh sir. Where in Andhra Pradesh? In Andhra Pradesh…. I think Guntur. Yes sir, Guntur. Where in Guntur? In Guntur…. Bradipet. Yes, Bradipet. Bradipet. Where in Bradipet? In bra… We are shifted into to Pune? Oh, shifted to Pune? I did not know that What does your parents do?

They run some or the other. We shall meet again. Shayam Sunder! Say sir. We wanted to go for photoshoot, right? Use this for backdrop Keep nice items even in the foreground. What to put sir? Look how he is? He looks like to drink blood in glass. No sir, we get booked. Cool Shyam Sunder. You fear for everything. What if we live or die coming so far? Who would die sir? What is you loving and me dying sir? Sir.. What is dying? Who are you? Uncle said to take care. Did uncle say? See if uncle shows. I will not show to anyone. Wants me to show, bloody! What Anu? Should wake up and give coffee in the morning, right? What is this? Good morning sir. Morning Siri! What sir, it is a waste to park before house and keep cleaning it daily? Go, sell it and buy a new vehicle. Before, I thought twice to sell this and buy a new vehicle But both the times, Anu objected. First was her Intermediate fees and second was her B Tech fees. Then I understood. The things or persons who like us will never go easily from our lives though we try any hard. Wow, well said sir. Experience and age will never go waste. Anu baby, listen to what dad says. Those which like us will never go even we try, it seems. I too am the same. Will not go however you push. Why are you so cute early in the morning babe? Kill you..

I have not seen such variation in my life. Shyam Sunder Sir Come here Tell me sir Are all expressions ok? Great sir. What ok? Looking them, it is not like snaps for wedding card, but for Aadhar card. What is that Chemistry, I am not understanding? They are not like to be wife and husband. Like marrying on force from elders, marrying unable to say no to dad.. Arun! Nothing so right? What else then Arun? Your would be wife, take her near and put hands on the waist. Look into the eyes and work out the chemistry. Anu, he is your to be husband. Why are you so far, cooperate? cooperate? It comes out only then, right? What to come out sir? Should ask doubts and results to be seen. I see. Come on take.. Anu, come on Anu you can do it. I know.

No need to act from now. Sangeet this evening will be the last event for your marriage. If you had said me I love you, at least friendship between your families would have been left. Look, if you do bloody deeds and make my father feel… No, nothing will happen to your dad. You are my target. See you. Shyam! Sir What? You look somewhat relaxed? No sir, always alert. Thinking 24 hours about you. I am waiting to see Anu saying I love you to you sir. She will say by the end of this Sangeet. She should really say so sir… You too are smart like this dress.

Shyam Sunder Sir What is he saying Honeymoon? What is it sir? His wife and his wish. Where are you and what are you talking? They will have a lakh things between them. Will you say whatever you feel? What happened? Shall I say? Siri, say what he said? Anu is not loving you. Looking at the relationship between her and your parents, with the soft corner that you are supporting them from childhood, she said yes but she has no special interest on you. What Shyam Sunder, that is what you said right? Still, you do not care all these Arun. Leave it. This fellow got doubt means all out there would be with the same doubt, right? Obviously, but will not say on the face right? Why to mess unnecessary things? Hey! Sir With what would you think that Anu is in love with me? Shall I call and make her say? Only I will know saying here and all would know when said openly. You said that right? What, say? Ok, will make her say in open. What else, move? You always stand still. He is extremes for sadism.

I will shoot you down bloody? I said personal, right? Can you not understand? down. Nandu is not coming sir, but my sister is coming. What is this happiness sir? Sir, when did you and Nandu madam meet for the first time? I think that was 2005. As a part of duty, I went for a riding. Nandu there in the lodge…Was she caught? She is a Philanthropist man. What, a case? Shyam Sunder, not a case but Philanthropist. That means a social worker. I see. That day Nandu making them all sit around her and saying that work was wrong, I was like… Do something Shyam Sunder, please. Night in the Sangeet, when Nandu madam goes so, you suddenly stamp over her dress. Sir, close your mouth sir. Flies are going in. Later after dinner, wipe hands to the dress of Nandu madam. Ladies would like a lot doing so. What is this dirty without washing hands? Wash sir. Should wipe after washing. What sir, what are you seeing? Look there, how beautiful she is?

No. You are great. I did this just for you. An offer for you. I will leave on the spot from here if you do not say my name. I love my dad. What is this brother? You said to leave, right? Leave now. Not saying his name means is like you said my name. Shyam Sunder say, who is your favourite? Why me, you say about yours sir. No Shyam Sunder… Siri, should say Siri, should say Hi Anu - Hi Will you not introduce your fiancé to me? Come! Arun, my friends. Hi, you are so lucky. Sir, drinks. What happened now Shyam Sunder, he reacted so much? What is that behaviour in open? Are you gone mad? Dad, my mood is not good. Please leave me alone. What happened son? Mom, do I not like you and dad? Why are you asking so dear? Then.. Anu may like her dad, but should know about the dais we are talking on, right? It my marriage Sangeet taking place. I said so great of her like a mad guy. She should have said my name at least for name sake, right? Dad, we are into this marriage to give a good life to Anu, right? What happened dude? Nothing, he is feeling as Anu did not say his name. Leave him, just a kid Arun, what is this? You know about her, right? She does not know anything other than me from childhood. Say, why would she agree for this marriage without love on you? Ok, I apologise on her behalf. This would not repeat again. I am sorry. What Arun, is this what you wanted? Uncle, I am sorry. Uncle! I like Anu a lot uncle. I behaved so in possessive nature as she did not take my name. But not to hurt you uncle. Cool, what is this crazy fellow? What is this sir? Looks like all good formed into a society. Good ones? Not us, right? Thankyou. Wow.. I feel very happy to see you all like this uncle. Your friendship, relationship and bonding for 30 years… You just got together immediately you started the disturbance started. Hats off! But bro, you just said may be in flow or came from the heart… You should have not said that. What did I say Siri? You said to be doing this marriage either to give a lift or life to Anu, right? It is a bit tough to intake that. What you said is making me too feel that you are into this marriage with pity than love. Siri, you are completely misunderstanding this. My intensions are not.. What misunderstanding Arun, you were just saying with your mom and Siri.. stop now. Why are you getting into everything? We will have a lot in between. Why for you? Who the hell are you? Arun, I am really sorry. I seriously did not mean to hurt you. Leave it with this. I apologise on his behalf. It is ok Anu. Arun, I love you. What is it sir? You said for you but she said I love you to him. I said, yes. I heard what she said clearly. Should you poke me again by asking? Why so many troubles if she would fall so easily? What happened mom? Happy birthday dear. You should not love anyone greatly in life. It is a feeling like carrying a baggage without knowing. We unknowingly keep killing our own character. I have been on doing some or the other for Anu. I too will come with you, move. Where? What where? To the house of Anu. Hello, do you think it any movie theatre to buy ticket and come? I faced many troubles to get in there, you cool it now. Not that son… Mom, I beg you. I am unable to digest the condition by your husband. You do not come now and put new ones now. Bearer, come here. You pay the bill and go home carefully. She would come and help us it seems. Here is 40 Lakhs uncle. Where did you get so much money? Seth met on the way and gave this to give you. But have not given documents, not signed and… It seems is going abroad on some work and said to take care of formalities later. Is it?? Mom, it is all her luck. Yes, true dear. God exists mom. Yes, God and even Goddess exist. Hello sir! Mom, I said not to come, right? She is my sister and name is Satyavathi. Hello Hello! Who is this boy? The groom? You too thought so sister? I too thought the same at the start. Not the groom, but best friend of the bride. Sir, my sister helps me during such marriage seasons. I am Page 3 means photo sessions, organising Sangeet and doing make overs. My sister is Page 4 sir. What is page4? It is to make over the bride, perform rituals and so on. You also said Anu has no mother and ladies cannot say us all. I expected would be good for ladies to be present and called her. You said to have none and now suddenly brought a character saying sister. At least one similarity should be there if is sister, right? Why do you say so, son? Is it necessarily to born together to call as a sister? Is it necessarily to born together to call as a sister? Seeing him, I feel like calling brother. That means we are born to same mother? Son is a fraud and his mom is more a fraud. Sir, call Anu once. Let them introduce. Baby Anu! Anu! You managed well! I am your mother. You put one message and I filled the message box. How much? Sorry man, I cannot reveal. How is the girl? She is a wow dear. That is why your son is flat sister. Why do you stare so, take blessings? She is your mother in law. That is, she just called your dad as brother. That means she is so, right? What Shyam Sunder Yes, the same. Yes dear, she is sister of Shyam Sunder. He brought to accompany you till the marriage is done. Hey Shyam Sunder! Sir Look, Anu looks like a Goddess. Yes, she is like a Goddess and he is like a God. Here! Come on sir! Not staring always at me! What is your range and what are you doing? Why do you not say who you are and take her away by marrying? You say greatly as Goddess again. Oh sorry, you have it please. No, you have it please Please! No, it is ok Hey bloody, come here. How many here? Two sir Why do you bring just one? Go and bring two. Go! Idiot! No common sense Nandu, we are having to teach. Oh, one second! Hello! What sir, why is one cool drink sent? Have you seen two straws put in that? Oh no! Please send again, I will manage somehow. Come on sir, she would spit on face. Take out anything sensibly sir. Now I will bring up love matter. Everybody is into love. What sir, how far has yours come? You are finally getting daughter married. How much dowry are you giving? There will be nothing so between us. Hey Shyam Sunder, heard a very good positive word. Dowry! Who are you sir? Hey Siri! He is Prasad, childhood friend to me and Koteswara Rao uncle. Is it for that, you are insulting our uncle in open? What is insulting in this? I asked how much the dowry is. Dowry again? Our Anu should say ok, and putting aside hundreds and thousands of crores… They are ready here to pay back and marry. Not that son, I was just casual.. What casual sir? You say in public and then casual. Are you eating rice or pulav? What wait sir, will anyone directly ask dowry? Hey stop! What did he say now? Hey, you know right? What I have is a daughter and the house. It is for her, right? Ok, think so. Uncle, you are insulting Anu again. You wait boys.. Let him just think for his satisfaction, what is to lose? Hey, Koteswara Rao is out there.Go to them. Ok Congrats dude! You got beautiful daughter in law and a great property. What are you saying? What property? Oh no! Look, how innocent is he asking? It seems he took the house as dowry. The stick lit started burning sir. Who said you? All are thinking so. Koteswara Rao sir, it seems the house is ours now. Say if there are any faults, we shall correct. Hey Jagannatham! They would fight now sir. I too thought no till now, but no way. What dude? Have you given house as dowry? Have you given house as dowry? I said just… One minute! Lakshmi, give the house keys. Give it here. Here baby, authority from now is yours at my house from today. Accountant, change the cheque power on to her name. From now, any incoming or outgoing rupee should be known to her. Uncle, come here once. Who said that with you? Why all that now? No problem uncle, say it. No problem uncle, say it. Sir, I said it. I said for fun when asked what the dowry was, said that house was is given. Rascal! Do you not know where to joke and where not to? Out! Will kill if you are seen here again in this place. Not that sir, I said so in fun that what is dowry for our Anu. What bloody? Our Anu? Get out. Anu, any problem if he is not in the marriage? For you, uncle Get out bloody! Move, get out! Hey! Take the sacred rice. Are you too leaving as your son left aunty? I am in a helpless state unable to express love, but am not blind to even recognise that. You are there for your son, aunty. But there is none other than me for my dad. Forgive me aunty. Are you understanding as to what you are doing? Daddy! You do not speak in between. Did you not realise till you got slapped? How did I bring you up? Dad please, leave it. I was wrong and lost. I will do as you say from now. We are ready and will fix the date as and when you say. Hi uncle,, Hi! Come dear, sit. Come... What's the matter? Uncle came from the US. A small gift for Siri. Oh, wow! Watch! Take, go and give him. He is up. I called. He said not in good mood and said to meet later. Oh, nothing so dear… No problem uncle, I can understand. Say about my arrival after his mood gets ok. See you uncle. Siri! Siri! What is this? What do you want to show? You left saying to achieve something. Unable to achieve anything there, came back and what do you want to show here? He losing there is showing that frustration on us. I have not lost dad What? I have not lost. Come, there is a meeting. Nothing like meeting and all. Say whatever right here. There is no outer here. Anu loved me even not knowing me as your son. Her dad too loved me. Everybody there loved me. I have not lost. You made me lose. Many thanks Siri. There would have been a big problem, if you had taken that on you then. Somehow, all are coming along for marriage of Anu. When fearing how to do the marriage in such a short time, you coming as friend of Anu… Shyam Sunder saying to do for free, Seth giving 40 lakhs without any papers and signatures… It would have been good if all these happened. But you made them to happen. Seth called saying that money was ready and asked me to collect. Who are you? What do you need? Did you love Anu? What will you do marrying her? I will take good care. Good means.. Without any shortage for money or anything else. With love, pampering and… Every day would be like a festival with me for Anu. I will see to that she is in the same freedom with me as she is with you. What about your family members? You will take good care as you loved her. Will even your family members show the same love as you? All of us celebrate as Goddess arrived when a girl baby is born in our houses We send the same Goddess as a maid to another house after 20 to 25 years. She hits brothers when with us, shouts on mom and gets upset with dad. We accept those all with love. But when the same girl after marriage calls and says that husband is beating her, we say to bear. When says in laws are not treating well, we say to adjust. That situation will not be there in the house of my friend. All would love her. They respect her. You know who is the most luckiest in the world, Siri? The one who can happily sleep in peace after his daughter is sent to in laws house. You just said before that will take good care without any shortage. You said so means you are very rich. Rich like you think a lot about middle class people like us. True Siri, we think of sending our girls to somewhat rich families. But if we know that house has just money and nothing else, we do not even think of that. Someone is rich does not mean to have huge money, but have great values. If you have such a house, come we will go. I will compromise all and you take Anu. I could not confidently say him dad that I too have a heaven like house and have such members there. Because I am seeing sister in law from five years. She runs into the kitchen even while eating when your car arrives in the portico. When her parents come once in a while, she fears you would see and sends them away by talking to them from outside itself. Why do they think to give such a life to the girl they loved so much, dad? What dad, will middle class girls just get flat for us? Will they come to us only by seeing security? This is called security and it is not there in our house. I have come leaving the girl I loved as I could not give her security, but not by losing. You always say to become rich overnight. What mom, has sister in law become rich overnight by coming to our house? Dad, any in law feels rich when the family head enquires about her wellbeing. It may either be house of poor, middle class or rich like us. A lady bears with as many insults she is subjected to. But cannot withstand if the same insult happens to her kids. Thus, sister in law is still the same even after five years of married life. You have never got the thought to ask even that, right? Because she did not want to bring another life into this house where she has no identity. Fear, where the in law would hold the born kid and say to have become rich overnight. who does not even know the names after being family member for five years. I have no courage to bring a girl I loved as wife to this house having a head Thus, I left and came but not by losing. Coming to Rupa, my manners are blocking as I imagined my life with Anu. But, do not worry. I will come back in two to three months. You gave me this life. You earned so much by working hard day and night. Sacrificing love for you is not a big deal, dad. I am once again telling from the bottom of my heart. You are my hero daddy. You are always my hero. Dad, some can see God from close and some from distance. But he sees all only from there. These differences are only for us but not for him. At what time is the marriage of Anu? Why is he here?? Who is he?? Krishna Mohan, He is a very big business man He is one among 100 richest indians. Hello...Hello I am.. Come on sir, you no need to indroduce We all know you. - Where can i find Mr.Jaganatham here, - He is Jaganatham, My friend Hello sir.. Hello, Please tell me. I don't wheather its the proper way to ask. It's okay sir, Please tell My younger son... He is in love with your daughte and that is why i am here. Who are you? Do you have any sense? Within ten minutes gap for marriage, do you come and ask for the girl? First, you leave from here sir. Just listen to me once. I know that I am doing wrong. But by the time I realised it as my mistake, only this ten minutes is left in the matter of my son’s love. They say victory of kids give happiness to parents. But, love of my son should not lose because of me. Sir, you are mistaken. None had come to us. Siri, as he loved may have come being selfish. But, my wife being the mother understood and I could not understand. We give the respect to your daughter as a mother is respected. Give one chance please. Sir We will talk after the marriage if something exists. You go and please stand to a side. You come dear, it is time now. Hey, one minute. I will talk. You come here dude. What is there that we talk about them? Just think once. Do you think they came so far without any confidence? Maybe Siri is in the heart of Anu. Hey Are you any mad? You are my friend. You brought her up in your hands. If something happens to her in future, without knowing who they are… I should have the status even to question them, right? With one phone call.. He can stop this phone call, he can stop this marriage. What more proof do you want than him personally coming and requesting? No dude! You wait. Anu! You like Siri, right? Arun, you bring Anu Please do not bother about what he said. He said so in anger. We all want Anu to be happy wherever she is. Sir, she is a motherless child. Just see to that her heart does not gets troubled. Mr Jagannatham, from today I have two daughters and two sons. Hey, why are you here? Wanted to marry? Why did you hide? Why did you not say all these to me? Am I looking a fool to you? Madam, I already said you. I lost my identity. All because of that one foolish act of yours. Be ready to face the consequences. You waste fellow…
