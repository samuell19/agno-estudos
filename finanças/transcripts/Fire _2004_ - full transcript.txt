Christ. Ranger 1, this is Ranger 2. Come in. Over. This is Ranger 1. Over. Hey Boss, I'm here at the old Minnesota mine, over. Looks like we've got visitors...again. Over. Some people just never learn. You got that right. I will check things out. I'll get back to you, all right, Lloyd? Over and out. Help! Tiny, is that you? - Yeah! - What the hell are you doing here, Tiny? I told you to keep out! When we get up top, I'll take care of him. How? It won't be the first time someone tripped and fell down this damn shaft. I'm coming to get you. Hold on! Get us out! Help us! Help! - Get us out! - Stop moving it! Come on, man! Come on, make it snappy! Faster, man. - Almost there. - Come on, hurry up! Hurry. Don't move around too hard. I'm here. It's stuck. Tiny, give me a hand. One... two... harder... Come on, hurry! Not you. Help them first! Go! Grab the rope! - What? - Up the rope! Agh! Come on! Come on. Come on. Too slippery. Hold on. Come on. Tiny! Just won't learn, will you? Not when there's a mother load like this down there. My gold! Come on! Get your ass up here! Tiny! Tiny, forget the gold. Help me! Get me out! - Open the hatch! - Push! It's stuck. Take the damn gold. Just open the fucking hatch! I don't want the gold. Tiny, I can't! Burn in hell! Tiny! Coming for you, man! Fall guy! Wait up! What kept you, Sharon? Next time, Marcus, next time. Yeah, you keep telling yourself that. Marcus won again. Yeah. To the victor go the spoils. - Is that it, honey? - Don't go there, Marcus. - So, where to next? - Follow me. Keep it up, kid! Ready for the big one? Hey Christopher, you're up. I don't think that's such a good idea, Marcus. Mel's right. Chris has never jumped a bike. Hey, Chris! You sure you want to do this? The girls here think it might be a little too difficult. What do you say? I can do it. I want to give it a shot. I don't think you should, Chris. Hey, I can handle it. It's too big a jump for your first time. You should start off with something smaller. You know what, dude? They're probably right. No, it's fine. I can handle it. He's fine. He'll be okay. He wants to do it. He's just saying he does. Seriously buddy...uh... why don't you just play it safe after all. This isn't funny. He could really hurt himself. Will you guys just quit it. I'm going to do it. End of story. Okay, but listen up. Keep your front wheel straight, really gun it, and lift when you hit the jump. Yeah, she's right, man. Don't try to do what I did, just, uh, just imitate the girls here. It's a snap. Got it. It's a snap. See, I told you. The man wants to jump, just let him jump. Okay, let's go, rookie! We don't got all day. Oh, my God. Chris. Don't blame me. You set him up and you know it. Chris! Chris, are you okay? Are you okay? Chris. Hello, 9-1-1! We have a bad accident. Got a call in from a gal on a cell phone. Seems we got us an accident down by Smugglers Notch, Jake. Oh yeah? What kind of accident, boss? Ah, some dumb ass kid cracked himself up on his dirt bike. All right, you have an assessment on injuries? Broken leg by the sounds of it. What's our ETA? We're coming in over Smugglers Notch right now. Keep an eye out for those jack off kids. Yeah, you got it. - Over here! Over here! - Over here! Hey! I can't get in. It's too tight. I'll do a sweep and find us a better LZ nearby. What's the matter with you? We're down here. Where are they going? What's happening? - Relax, Chris, they'll be back. - Over here! If not, screw them. We'll take care of this ourselves. Not too many places around here to set the bird down. Well head back and I'll winch her in. Ready to go, buddy? No, not really. But I'm going anyway. You got to hold still. I've got to fix this splint. Okay... okay... - Damn! - Okay. Boss, I'm okay. Winch me down. I've just got to get this thing tied up. Hey, I'm Ranger Jake Langford. What do we got here? Fractured tibia. Give me something for the pain. We'll let the hospital take care of that. - What's your name? - Chris. Chris, I'm going to have to check this. I need you to lie still. Ahhh! What are you doing? - Any signs of bleeding? - No. Chris, do you have any shortness of breath? - No. - No? - Any dizziness? - No. No? Any blurred vision? Okay, what about your spine? Does this hurt? No. It's good. - Your neck? - No. All right Chris, you have no signs of spinal trauma. What you do have is a broken tibia. Your shin is broken. I'm going to send you up there. You're going to do nothing. Let me do all the work. - Whatever, man. Just get me to a hospital. -That's a deal. You'll be okay, Chris. We'll meet you back at the hospital. Don't worry about your bike. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Chris, focus on me. Don't look up. Get this thing down! You're all right. We're going down. Oh, my God! Goddamn it! - Hey! - Get him down! - Get him down! - I've got you! Look at me! Look at me. It's going to break! - Stop moving like that! - Chris! Calm down. Chris! Hold on! Goddamn winch. We're going down. Steady, baby. Steady. - Chris! Are you okay? - He's fine. He's fine. You're all right. You're all right. Son-of-a-bitch. What happened? Over. Damn winch broke. Can't get you back up. Over. All right. We'll bring him out on land. Have an ambulance waiting at the entrance to the park. Call St. Paul's Emergency, notify them we're on our way in. It should take us about a couple of hours. Over. Ten-four. It's okay. All right. Let it out. It's all right, Chris. It's a normal reaction to all that damned spinning. Come on, turn him over. Ohhh. That's a nice splint. Who dressed this splint? - I did. - Sharon. Two years paramedic training. That's good work, Sharon. Thank you. That'll save us a lot of time. Chris, we are going to get you to a hospital as quickly and safely as possible. Okay. It should take us about a couple of hours and I am going to give you a shot for the pain. - Now we're talking. Yeah, you lucky dog, you're going to enjoy the ride home, I guarantee it. Give me this hand. - Fix me up. It's going to be a little bee sting. You ready? And there we go. That's it. All done. Oh, hey. What's your name? - Marcus. - Marcus. How did the accident happen? Excuse me. The accident. Chris's leg. Nah, don't tell me he actually tried to jump that stack of logs? - Of course. - Made it, too, except for limpy over there. Got to wonder, though, what kind of idiot would come up with that brilliant idea, huh? I'm sorry. What? I'm going to check on your friend. It's Marcus, right? I'm going to want you to piggy-back out with one of your friends. Sure, but what about my bike? Your bike, is she still running? Yeah. I think so. Mind if I take her out for you? Okay. Think you can handle it, big guy? It is a powerful bike. One wrong move, you're up, you're over. I can just do my best and I can try. The thing is... the clutch is on the left side, correct? I'm just wondering if maybe you can give me some tips. - Yeah, maybe. - Yeah? So, any chance of speeding things up here? This bullshit is ruining my plans. I'm sure Chris feels terrible that his broken leg is messing up your plans, Marcus. But maybe, you know, you can just get on your bike take a chill pill-- then we can actually get out of here. And take your friend to the hospital. Who's Chris riding with? Chris can come with me. - Is that okay, Chris? - Sure. - Promise I'll avoid the bumps. - Ooh. Now this I got to see. Oo-oo-ooh! Oooh! I think I can handle it, Marcus. It's okay. Look, let's go slow and easy though. No hotdogging required. Let's just get Chris to the hospital and enjoy the scenery. What's the hold up? Smoke. I smell smoke. Shit. I don't smell nothing. Do you guys? No, it's definitely there. It's just faint. Then why can't we see it? It's the distance. The fire is still far enough away. - How can you be so sure? - Yeah. I don't smell anything. It's not just the smoke. It's the trees. It you look up you'll see how the leaves all curling upwards. The birds are all flying North. It's the forest's way of warning us. It's telling us there's a fire's coming up behind us from the South. Don't worry, we're going to be okay. Ranger 1, this is Ranger 2, come in. Over. Ranger 2 to Base. Come in please. Over. This is Ranger Base. Over. Max, I'm trying to locate Lloyd in the chopper. Over. He signed off. He's landing the bird and returning to base. You bringing those kids in? Over. Yeah, that's affirmative, but we got a fire down here, Max. She's the first of the season. And the forest is all fuel ready to burn, y'know. Over. Where is it? Over. I'd say she's about five clicks South of Smugglers Notch. But she's sneaking up behind us, moving real fast. Now look, I can get the kids out of here, but we're going to have to hustle. And Max, she's a big one. So you better put out the call, bring in the troops, okay? Over. That's a Roger. Over and out. Everything's great. Ranger Base is going to deal with the fire. We have a nice head start, but just to be safe I think we'll change course and speed up. - Change course? - Yeah. All right, that's it. Time out. Guys, are we nuts or what? I don't see any fire or smoke, or anything. This guy is a flake. Why are we listening to him? Why, Marcus? Because if we continue into the wind we're going to hit a wall of fire. So we're going to take the safer route, the longer route, west. - Longer? - Longer. North is the quickest route to the park entrance. You and I both know that. So I'm not heading west just because you have some idea. Excuse me, maybe-- I'm not making myself perfectly clear. You need to shut up, suit up, and that's it. We're heading west. You really think you're something, don't you? Look. What's up, Jake? You're nothing. Oh, my God. We got ourselves a big one, Lloyd. Jake just radioed it in. Little early for this time of the season. - You put out the call? - Soon as I finished talking with Jake. I'll try him again. - Where's he at? - Five clicks from the fire. Okay, I'll get up in the air, radio in the fire's coordinates. Where's Betsy? - Far end of the lake. - You stay here. Get the hot shot crew up there to clear away all the brush and dig a trench. Without any fuel, it'll probably burn itself out. Don't you worry, I'm on it. Ranger Base to Ranger 2. Come in, Jake. Over. Ranger Base to Ranger 2. Come in, Jake. Over. What do you say, Betsy? You ready for a spin? What? That's impossible. You led us right to it! It's impossible. The fire's behind us. Don't look like "behind us" to me, pal. To me, it looks like it's in front of us. There's no way it got around us. That cannot happen. - It's right there. - It's got to be another fire. Come on man, what are the chances of that? None. All right? None! It doesn't make any sense. Something's wrong here. The only thing that is wrong here, Jake, is you. I'm sorry, guys, but if you keep listening to this crackerjack then you're as crazy as he is. I'm not going with you. No, what do you think you're doing? Trying to get as far as possible as I can from you. No. No. You are coming with us. You'll stay with us, being I'm in charge of you. And I call the shots. Get out of my way, Jake! No. Get on your bike. Get on your bike! No, don't do this! Don't do this. Get up. Don't make me tell you again. We can do this. We can do this. - We can do this. - Do what? We'll use the ride down to pick up speed. You think we can make it? What are you talking about? - We're going to ride right through her. - But if we-- Chris, we can't stay here. The other fire is coming up behind us. If we stay here, we get trapped. We got no choice, Mel. We got to go for it. Okay. She's not too big, yet. We can blast right through her. She's growing all the time so if we're going to go for it, we have to go now. Remember everybody, pick up as much speed as possible. Ride straight. When you hit the wall, punch through. Don't breathe, and don't slow down for anything. Or she's got you. All right? On three. One. Two. Marcus! I've got to get Marcus before he hits the fire! Come on. Follow me! Hurry up! - Come on, Mel, let's go. - I can't. Come on! Together! Go on! Go on! Guys, come on, we've got to go. - I can't. - We have to. Jake! Help! Sharon, I'm coming! I've got to go get Sharon! Mel, follow me through the fire! Follow my path! - We'll do it together! - Okay! I'll meet you on the other side. - Come on! - Together! Mel, we're going to blast through this. Redline the bike, keep it dead straight, and punch it out. The fire's not going to stop us. Nothing's going to stop us. We're going to make it. Okay. Okay. Oh, shit. Turn left! Ow! My shoulder! - Chris, are you okay? - Help! - Help! - Go! Go! - Jake! - Help! Guys, where are you? Over here. Can't get it off my leg! I got you. Come on. Hold onto me. Hold onto my back. Come on. - Can you hold it? - Yeah. I got it. Look out. Look out. I got it. Look out. Chris, you've got to hold the bike. - Can you hold it? Can you hold it? - I got it. I got it! The bike can't take all three of us. It's going to. Sharon! Come on. I'll take Mel. Great. Go! Ranger 2. Over. Ranger 1 to Ranger 2. Come in Ranger 2. Over. I can't let the fracture get worse. If it gets worse, it becomes a compound. It means the bone comes through the skin. I can't wait for the painkiller to kick in. Just do it. It's definitely going to hurt, just-- Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Okay, listen to me. Listen up. I'm popping it right now. Listen to me. I'm getting you out of here. I'm calling Lloyd on the walkie, we're going to get you-- Where's my walkie? - I can't find my walkie. - Oh, Jesus! - My walkie! - How's anyone going to know we're here? Listen to me. We have the bikes. We're going to be fine. What about Marcus? Where's Marcus? He said he was heading north. You mean he left us here? It doesn't matter, okay? Listen to me, we have our own problems. We can't go south, we can't go west. South is out. West is out. Which means we have to go North. - But I thought you said it was safest to go west? - I don't understand. The patterns of these fires make absolutely no sense. Do you understand that? They make no sense. - It's like someone is trying to set them. - Why? I don't know why. Sorry, I'm messing you up. Listen to me, okay? Listen to me, you'll go with Sharon. You take Mel. Now get out of here. I'm going to ride with Chris. I'm going to ride with Chris. Chris... Chris? Chris, listen to me. Okay... here we go! Watch your leg. Okay, you're on the bike. You're on the bike. I need you to stay on the bike. Focus, on the bike. On the bike... okay. Oh, my God. I didn't copy that, say again. Over. I'm over another fire. From the west. Lloyd, are you telling me that Jake is caught between two fires? Over. Roger. I'll fill her up and start fighting this son-of-a-bitch. Keep trying to raise him. Over. Ranger Base to Ranger 2. Come in, Jake. Over. Ranger Base to Ranger 2. Come in, Jake. Jake, pick up if you hear me. Over. This is Ranger 1, got a bellyfull of water. Headed out over the main fire. Ten-four, Ranger 1. Come on, Jake. You've got to be down there. Come on! What? I heard an explosion over there. Let's go. Marcus. Oh, my God! Oh, my God, Marcus, please. Please. Oh, my God, Marcus, no. Marcus, please. Please. Let me in. Sharon, let me in. What? ...fire... We're going to get you to a hospital. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay. Stay with me... stay with me... Stay with me... stay with me. Marcus, stay with me. Stay, stay, stay. It's okay, it's okay. it's okay. It's okay. Help him! I can't. Help him! Help him! I can't. He's dead. He's gone. He's dead. He's dead. - He can't be gone. - He's dead. He can't be gone. He can't be. He can't be dead. He's dead. He can't be dead! Sharon, he's dead. We're all going to die. We're not going to die. We're alive! Listen to me, we're alive. We're alive, but the fire is coming and we have got to go. The fire killed Marcus! It's going to kill us all. I want you to please listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. Mel can't ride. She can't ride with her shoulder like that. You understand me? Pull yourself together or we're going to die. We'll all die. You understand that we'll all die? Please don't let that happen. Please. Don't let it get us. Don't let it get us. Okay... okay. Let's go. Let's go. Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go. Let's go. Ready? Let's go! Let's go! Look. What did Marcus say before he...? He saw someone. Who? Someone in a pickup truck... starting fires. We drove by a pick up truck earlier today. - Whoever that arsonist is, he's cutting us off. - Why? - Don't know but I figure he's heading east. - East? Yeah, somehow he knows we're heading to Dead Man's Point. How would he know that? He's got to be a local. He knows the area. He knows the forest. So far the fires are north, west, south, which means east is the only way out. So if he starts a fire there, it'll join the others and it's going to trap us. What do we do? I'm going to go up to the ridge and find a way through. When I get back we're going to move fast. So you guys get rest, hear me? Rest. Thanks for what you did back there. Be careful. I will. I can't believe he's gone. This whole thing's a nightmare. This is going to sound weird, but I feel guilty about Marcus. What do we tell his parents? How do we explain that we left him back there in the fire? Look guys, right now we're just trying to stay alive here. The fire is coming in on us, and it's coming in fast. If we don't hang tough, we're dead. I'm not prepared to have us die here. So we're not giving up. We're going to forge ahead, find a way through this thing, okay? No looking back. Tiny. Tiny, you're alive. Been waiting a long time for this. You stole my face, my gold, everything! Tiny. Tiny... what are you doing? Don't do this. Tiny. Tiny... no, don't do this. Payback time, piss ant. Told ya you'd burn in hell. Never figured it be in your forest, did you? Tiny. Start! Start. Come on. Damn it! He's been gone a long time. Don't worry. Any sign of him, Mel? No. Listen! It's a plane. Hey! Hey! Hey! Over here! Help! - Help us! - Help us! - Help! - Hey! Here we go, Betsy. - Over here! - Come back! Ranger Base, this is Ranger 1. Still no word from Jake. Over. Nothing? Over. Not even static. Going to keep trying, Lloyd. Over. Ten-four. Over and out. How long are we just going to wait around? Let's give him some more time. If he's not back in another half hour, we'll figure something out. Like? Maybe the best thing is for two of us to go ahead and get some help while one of us waits here for Jake. Two of us? Yeah. You two go, and I'll stay here. No way. Look, you both know we don't stand a chance with three of us on one bike. The best thing is for me to wait here for Jake and then we'll follow you. It's our best shot. Forget about it! Mel's right. We've left one of us behind as it is. We're not going to do that again. Look! There he is. I knew he'd come back. Thank God you're okay. What happened? It's nothing. It's all right. Listen, I caught the firebug. He's dead, but he started another fire to the east. So we have to get out of here before it traps us. So what are we doing sitting here and talking? Suit up. Chris with me. Hold on tighter. Oh, my God! Help! Help me! Put it out! I'm going to check you out. - Here? - Yeah. - Here? - Ow. I know. I know it hurts. What about here? Here? - Ow. - Here? Look, it's not broken, it's just bruised. Chris, how are we doing? The fire's right behind us. The bikes are totalled. Listen. Over the ridge over here, there's an old mine. If we get inside, guys, we'll avoid the fire. We'll take the tunnels. You think we can make it? Yeah, we have to. Okay, Chris, take Mel. Sharon, I got you. You're with me. Come on, let's go. We're going to make it. Come on. Sharon, get down! No. What's wrong? That's the entrance to the mine. - We're surrounded by fire. - We're trapped. No way, we can't be this unlucky, no way. What are we going to do? I have to-- I have to think. Come on, come on, come on. 911. You called 911. How did you call 911? - I have my phone. - What? Does it work? - The batteries are low. - It's okay. What the hell? Come on, be there. Be there! It's snowing! It's not snow. It's ash. Lloyd! Lloyd? - Jake! We thought you were- - No time for that! Listen, tell me you're up in Betsy. Sure am. Tell me you got a belly full, boss. Damn, I'm empty, Jake. Look, we're at the entrance to the Minnesota mine. East side. We need to get inside, and we're surrounded by fire. Okay, gotcha. Hang tight, buddy. Ranger Base, this is Ranger 1, I got Jake. That's great news, Lloyd. 10-4, over. He's at the east entrance of the Minnesota mine. I'm clearing a way. Out. - What have we got? - Thanks for coming. Now listen up, we got us a serious situation near the old Minnesota mine. Jake Langford and some kids are trapped and you've got to get him out. You hotshot crew, you've got to stop that fire. I see him. Okay, Betsy. Come on, come on, come on. Yes! All right, let's go. Come on. Come on, let's go. Jake! Hurry up! Get in here. Come on, Mel. You guys, come on! - Get in here! - Come on! Okay. Phone. Lloyd? Lloyd, are you still there? Yeah, and I'm guessing you made it. Yeah, we made it. Listen, we're heading to the main entrance. Boss, get a crew over there, hold the fire back. Got a hot shot crew at the base. Max will reroute them to meet you. See you at the other end, buddy. We'll see you. We will see you. Let's go. Let's go! They made it. They all made it! They're heading for the main entrance. 10-4, Lloyd. They're on their way over. Over and out. All right guys, listen up. Hey, listen up, guys. We've still got a lot of work to do. We've got to stop that fire from getting to the mine. So let's move. Wait, we got to go... Across... right. Move! Jake! Hold on. I'm going to get you! Jake. Jake. Jake! - You okay? - Is everybody okay? - Lie still. - You all right? My ankle snapped. My leg is... I think it's broken. And I think some internal hemorrhaging. We've got to get him to a doctor. No. Now listen to me. Listen to me. You've got to get out of here now. The mine is going to cave in. It's going to cave in. It's too risky. We can't move you. No, not me. Not me. You guys have got to go. Okay, go now. Go now! No way. We're not going anywhere without you. Come on, let's get him up. No. You guys... Chris, take them out. Take... Okay, okay. I'm up. I'm up. I'm up. Chris, you lead the way. Mel and I will take Jake. Jake, which way? That way. Straight down and right at the juncture. Keep going! Watch out! Watch out! Go, go, go! Guys, I don't know how much longer this torch is going to hold up. What are we going to do without any lights? Keep... keep moving. I don't suppose it's the right time to tell you that I'm kind of claustrophobic? Hey, you got it easy, Sharon. I'm afraid of the dark. Excellent. Like the commercial says, "It just keeps on running." Which way, Jake? Straight down, and then we make the first right. Then it leads us into the shaft. After that the main entrance is about a, I think, a quarter mile. - Let's move. - No. Jake's got to rest, and so do you. I don't know how much longer that leg of yours can last. Don't worry about me. What's that weird smell? Yeah, I can smell it, too. Everybody get down behind those containers. - What's going on? - Get down, now! Cover your face and shut your eyes. Don't breathe. Hold your breath! What the hell was that? It's methane. The mine's full of pockets of the stuff. - That's what caused the cave-in earlier. - Great. That's just great. Is it getting hotter in here? What does getting hotter mean? That means that if it gets too hot the methane's going to ignite and this place becomes an inferno. Oh God. How can this be happening to us? When are we going to catch a break? We're not dead yet. I'd say that's taken a whole lot of luck. Right, Jake? Yeah, Chris is right. You're right. We got to get out of here. Keep moving. We got to keep moving. We got to keep moving and make sure we get to that central shaft before it's too late. All right, let's go, guys. I want everyone to stay away from the entrance of the mine. It's filled with methane, and it could go up at any time. Now, I need fire lines on the left. You guys give me a fire line on the left. You guys, I want fire lines on the right. Your fire line is over there. Guys, this is it. Reinforce the fire lines. Reinforce the fire lines to the right. Ready? Move! He won't admit it, but he's getting weaker. We've got to let him rest. We can't stop for long. It's getting hotter. I think if we wait the whole thing will burn up. But if he doesn't rest-- Don't think about it. The guy eats nails for breakfast, for Christ's sake. We've got to take the risk. Look, once we get to the main shaft I'll hang back with Jake. You guys go for help. The two of us are just holding you back. I'll look after him once you gone. We'll be okay. What about the methane? We got through it once, we can do it again. I'll try and get some cover for us, just in case. Come on. Let's move. Watch out, the track's a little chewed up. What is it, Jake? Nothing. Across that shaft is the tunnel that leads to the main entrance. One question though... how we going to get past this damn hole? Well, I got one idea. Chris. Grab that rope over there and bring it here. I got a bad feeling about this, Jake. Okay. Okay, look, one of you is going to have to go across there to the other side. Now you take this rope, you toss it over that overhead beam there. You swing across, you tie it off, toss it back to us. We're going to climb over. What? We shimmy over. It's the only way across. Let me do it. I was the captain of the high school gymnastics team. We won the state finals. But what about your leg? Get the rope and throw it over the beam and I'll swing over. Chris, that's a terrible idea. Look, somebody's got to do it. And that somebody's going to be me. He's right. Chris is right. It's all about upper body strength, Chris. It's all about upper body strength, and he's got it. You got it. Do it. Do it. Wish me luck. Okay. Okay, Chris. Chris... Do it. - Grab on! - Chris, grab on! Whoa! No! - Whoa! - Grab on! Come on, Chris. Come on. - Hold on! - Hang on, Chris! Chris! - Get back up! - Come on! Get up there! Come on! Pull up! Pull yourself up! Come on! You can do it! Come on! Chris! Please! Chris! Get up! Come on, get up! Get up! Please, come on! Up! Come on, use that strength! Come on! Use that strength! Good! Are you okay? Piece of cake. Jesus. Al right, Mel. I'm going to throw the rope over at you, okay? Okay. Here we go. I've got it. All right, now tie it off. Okay, I'm tying it off. All right. Done. Okay. Good to go. Okay, Sharon, you first. But what about Jake? Go. Don't worry about me. Come on. You go now. Okay. I can manage this. Go. Okay. Take it easy at the top. Now you climb over hand over hand as quick as you can. Go. Okay. You're doing good. Good, good, good. Faster. Go faster. Don't look down. That's great. Great. That's good. Okay, Mel, you're next. Go. Good. Okay, you're doing good, honey. Just keep going like that. That's good. That's good. Chris, grab her! Grab her. Argh! Okay, the methane could go at any time. Listen, head to the main entrance now. Don't wait for me. Go. Go! - No. - You've got to hurry. No, I can't. Just go save yourselves. I can't. We're not leaving without you. Hurry. Hurry. Come on, man. Keep going. Come on, Jake. I'm trying. You can do it! Come across. Jake, don't give up. Keep going. Come on, Jake. You can do it, Jake. Come on. Argh! Hang on! Come on, get up there! We're watching. You can do it! - Come on, Jake! - Hang on! Jake, you've got to hurry. You're close. Come on, you've got to hurry up. - Come on, Jake. - Come on. Run! Tiny! Don't! Die, piss ant. Chris, I'm coming! Chris, behind you! Got to get the medical supplies in right away. What's the injuries? Don't know yet. Hurry. Help them! Hurry, you've got to help them! What's wrong? What's wrong? - Calm down. - There's a man... Who's the man? - Is Jake Langford down there? - Yes! Yes! Goddamn it! Jake! You can do it, Jake, you can do it. Yes! Come on! Do it! Chris, are you okay? No. How about you? My leg's killing me. I feel like crap... I'm having trouble breathing, all right, barely. Let's get the hell out of here. Before it's too late. This reminds me of third grade. Me and Bobby Luchinski were in a potato sack race. Except you're not as fast as he is. I'll have to try and improve that. You better. Otherwise I'll have to get another partner. Okay, we've got to go. What the hell was that? - It's not good. - Meaning? Oh, it's methane explosion in the main mineshaft. The fireball's probably rolling this way right now. Oh, shit. I take it back. You move faster than Bobby Luchinski. I thought so! Jake! Thank God. Thank God you're okay. Are you okay? My leg. Easy, easy. I'm okay. Are you all right? Yeah, I think so. You look like crap. You do. Thanks. I'm going to get the paramedics over here. I've got to tell you, we need a vacation after all of this. Looking for some company? You bet. Just nowhere hot, okay? Guess you want to get the hell out of here, huh? Well... I've kind of taken a liking to things around here. You think you could do with a paramedic in these parts? What do you think, Jake? I think I could definitely, personally use a paramedic. Ow, ow, ouch. It's okay, it's okay. Get the fire out! Let's move it! Get the fire out! Off to the right. You guys spray down that side.
