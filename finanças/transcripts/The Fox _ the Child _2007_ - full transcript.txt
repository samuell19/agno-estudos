'My heart was beating flat out. 'He was so cute. 'For a moment, I thought I might be able to touch him. 'Throughout the day at school, 'I could only think of the fox at the big beech tree. 'On my return to the place where we met, 'I was sure I'd find him again. 'I'd decided that I would try and tame this fox.

Good. And this is our house. This is my chair. And this here is the door. Are you coming in? Hey, stay still! Let's pretend this is your collar. Is that OK? Come on! Er, you just hit your head against the wall. So we'll say you were waiting for me, while I went for mushrooms in the forest. Good. Now, you can't keep running off. Hey! Sit down! Sit down! Hey, stop! Come back here right now, or I won't be your friend! 'Lt upset me to see her run off like that, in the middle of our game. 'As usual, I had to wait until she wanted to come back.

I didn't know what to do. Should I look for her or go home and wait? 'It was in that moment I realized that the fox did't need words to understand me. I felt she had learned me something important. She had trusted me. 'that I understood why foxes always flee when they see us. 'They have known for a very long time that we could never truly be friends. Why did you leave?
