(ominous music) - I was 40 years old when I endured the worst day of my life. I had already spent most of the day at the hospital watching a loved one slowly die of liver disease. His name was Mel. The poor soul was not only a dear friend, but my brother-in-law. The only brother to Lonnie, my husband. (phone dings) (machine beeps) Both Lonnie and Mel were great men. (machine dings) Good men by the hump of their street standards, although weak, (phone beeps) and prone to addiction which made living in Vegas the worst possible city for them to inhabit. Yes... Las Vegas. (pacemaker beeps) (sniffles) Is it that bad? - Yes, it is. His vital signs have gotten worse. His kidneys had shut down. As I was telling your mom if there was ever a time to call someone, someone religious now would be the time. If you'll excuse me, I'll go get the doctor. - Is Orpah here? - No. I heard her shift ends in five minutes. (sniffles) Can you give Lonnie a call? - (sniffles) He's not answering my texts, Naomi. - He'll never forgive himself, if he's not here for his brother's final moment. (sobs) - I know. - Honey, can you give me a minute? - (sighs) I will keep trying. (pacemaker beeps) - Oh, my Heavenly Father, (sniffles) please accept my son. He knows you father. I know that he knows you. (sobs) - Lonnie, please call me back. Your mom needs you. I need you. (sighs) - [Commentator] As deep complete Warner's got it, and he's inside right around the 10 yard line. (phone rings) Only to called for Hughes Johnson (mumbles). (pacemaker beeps) - Open your arms Father. (sobs) Welcome my boy home. Let's celebrate though my pain. (sobs) - [Commentator] And aims is on the yard and open. He's (mumbles) for the Randy's touch down. (phone rings) Darnell, lucky to pass fires a touchdown into Jabelson Carter for the second touchdown of the game. The Jets lead the Raiders, but it's 13 / 7 after the missed extra point. (phone beeps) (Ruth sighs) (people chattering) (sirens wails) - [Ruth] They say in life to expect the unexpected. My husband and his brother died on the same night. It was devastating. (birds chirping) - It was nice. I just wish a few more of Mel's friends from work could have came. I guess we can take some part knowing that maybe they are together. I have to go. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye Orpah, I'll see you. - I'll see you soon. - Take care. - Okay. - I'm sorry. (sighs) - Do you have to work tonight? - (laughs) Not tonight. - Charles thought that moving us to Vegas would give us a new start. You know he's buried not too far from here, just over that hill. - What are you gonna do, mum? (sighs) - I don't know. Go home, I guess. Where the country roads take me home. You know just, it just never worked out here. It's time. - West Virginia? - Yeah. - I'm going with you. - No. No, no honey, I appreciate it, but you need to move back to your family. - You are my family, Naomi. - No honey, it's much more complicated than that. I don't have anything. I have nothing. I have no money, nothing. - Oh, and we have nothing. We have no money. - You know what I think? I have an old family farm house in West Virginia. It's up in the mountains. I own it with my sister. I think it's still standing. - (laughs) Still standing. - Well, what I mean to say is I think I have a place to live. - We have a place to live. (piano music) Look, it's didn't work workout here, and we have nothing left, but you are the mother to my husband, Naomi, so where you go, I go. Listen to me when you go, I go. Where you live, I live. You are my family, Naomi. The girl that got smart. I hear a yes. And your God is my God. (both sobbing) Come here. I love you. (ambient music) (country music) So we set forth on a new journey. Our week-long road trip was full of laughs, tears, memories of the past, and hopes for the future. I think it was Ohio when Naomi started acting different. - Look, wild and wonderful. - Wild and wonderful. - West Virginia, yeah. - (laughs) we did it. - Wild and wonderful West Virginia. - We did it!

(car engine revs) (car door opens) (car door closes) Home sweet home. - Well, it certainly isn't how I remembered it. - Are you sure this is it? (birds chirping) (steps creaks) (step creaks) (birds chirping) Naomi? Naomi? Naomi, wait! (birds chirping) - My sister's name was Judy. - I am so sorry. You didn't know. - I had a feeling about it, like I didn't wanna know. (sobs) (door opens) - Finally, we're home. - Let me get the light. The power is turned off. - How do you think. Oh, oh, gross, what is, that is just. - Plus I don't mix my hair. - It's gross, Naomi, it's all over me. I don't like it. - Okay, will you just (shushes). It's all right. Bedrooms are upstairs. I'm gonna go check on the kitchen. - Yeah, and I'm gonna get the luggage. - Okay. - All right. (door closes) - You're afraid to marry me. You'd rather live with that silly little fool who can't open her mouth except to say yes, no, and raise parcel of minimal brat just like you. - I request not to say things like that about Meloney. - Who are you to tell me I mustn't? You lead me on. You made me believe you wanted marry me. - Harsh, cold, and be fair. I never had any time. - You did, it's true you did. I hate you till I die. I can't think of anything better than to call you. (slap thuds) - Oh man. - What happened? - The battery died. - We'll just play it then. - Oh. (both laughing) - Sorry, I'll get the power turned on tomorrow. - I'm not complaining. Naomi? - Mh. - Tell me about growing up here. - In this house or in the city? - There's a city? I'm just kidding. - Yeah, no, you have to remember it was a different time. My dad was a coal miner and mom stayed at home. It was just me and my sister. - When did you realize? - You know as soon as I came up onto the porch. Oh, Judy was such a great housekeeper. She would've never let. - I'm sorry. - She would've never have left it like that. She loved this house. - So what did you guys do? Wake up at 6 AM. When the rooster crowed. Feed the hens, and milk the cows. - Oh, it's something like that. (both chuckling) - Yeah. Our bedrooms were upstairs where the two bedrooms are. One was Judy's one was mine. Mom and dad's bedroom was off the kitchen which when you are a teenager was a real pain, 'cause it made noise when you walk. We always snuck out at night to go to the barn, and it was just the two of us would just sit up and chat all night. - You guys were close? - Yeah. - Tell me about the city. - Of Bridgeport? - Mm-hm. - Well, I remember it's been 25 years since I've been there, so I'm not quite sure if it's the same, but 25 years well, maybe we can go and check it out tomorrow if you want. - Yes. - Well, I don't know what it's like anymore, but I can tell you what it used to be like. Oh, it was quite a special place. Everybody knew everybody. Sit on the front porch and you'd socialize. Oh, the 4th of July, fireworks. Oh, and there's this really big event at Christmas time, it's called Light Up Night. They used to bring this huge Christmas tree in the center town and everybody had helped decorate it. It's quite a special place. Are you cold? Here, let me just. Heavenly Father, thank you, thank you for my daughter. Thank you for her incredible heart. She is such a blessing. Thank you for bringing her into my son's life. Thank you for even for the love that he needed, and thank you for bringing her into my life. (ominous music) Father God, I just pray for your blessings on her. Bring her someone into her life, that can love her and take care of her, and protect her the way that she deserves. Someone that will look after her like a princess as she is your daughter. The daughter of a king. A mighty powerful king. (ominous music) Hello my name is- - Naomi Starkey. - Yeah. - Where have you been? Oh, it is so good to see you. I'm Cindy Sullivan was Powers. I went to Bridgeport Middle and High school with your sister. I'm so sorry. I just saw Danny yesterday at the buffet place. He had the grandkids, but it is good to see you. What can I do for you? - My parents' old house on Nacho road. - Okay. - 508 Lodge Field road. I would like to get the utilities up and running again, if that's possible. - Are you on the account? - Well, I was called when I was with my sister, so I should be. - Oh, here we are. Oh, can you give me a minute? - Sure. - Danny? - Ms. Starkey it says here the property is being foreclosed on. - No, no, no, there's a mistake, my parents paid off that mortgage years ago. - Well, it says here they tried to reach you, but got no answer. - Well, who did? - First Charter Bank and Trust. - I can't believe they would. - We'll figure it out. - My friend and I, all of our stuff is in that house, and we don't have any place else to go. - Ma'am you still own the property. The foreclosure is not till December 15th. - Can we just at least get the utilities running again, is that possible? - Ma'am, you still own the property, so we can look into getting a utility truck back up again, and we may be able to do that today, but as far as anything else you'll need to talk to the bank about that. - I will, I will. Thank you so much. - Cindy, go ahead and get this processed, and see if we can get a truck out there today. - All right. - All right, that'll be $316, and we have a mandatory deposit of $150 on new accounts. All righty. And you're all set. - Thank you so much. - It's so good to see you. - You as well. - Have a good day. (bouncy music) - We're getting three bags we don't need that many hotdogs. - We need hotdogs, stop. - Ruth, we don't need 1,000 hotdogs, enough. Just two packages that's all we need. - Naomi. - What? - Look, why is everybody staring at us? - Nobody's staring at. (bouncy music) - What? - Okay, bring that. (bouncy music) - Look. - Put it back. (music drowns out speakers) (bouncy music) You let a ninja kick. Oh please Lord, I need light to be there. We have light. Yes. Well, that was quick. - You know what that means/ (bouncy music) Let me, Naomi, let me, me, me. (Naomi and Ruth screaming) Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah. - I hear it, (mumbles) joys. - I can shower, Naomi. - Yes, please. Let's make this house a home. What do you say? - What about the bank? - You know what? I'm gonna trust the Lord, he's gonna take care of that. - Okay, for now I love you. - I love you more. Go and take a shower. - [Ruth] That was Naomi, she trusted God. She trusted people. There was something about coming back to that old farmhouse. Those memories Naomi had, they affected her. I could see a difference, but for me I just knew we had made the right choice. Now we had to clean and clean we did. (bouncy music) (faucet runs) - I saw you. (Ruth laughs) (bouncy music continues) (Naomi mumbles) (indistinct) Seriously? (Ruth laughs) (birds chirping) - My name is John. I live right down the road, and I saw there were some people up here. - Naomi Starkey. - Mr. John Westover. You know, I've always loved this old farmhouse, so if you ever need any help fixing some things, some minor repairs, I'd be glad to give a hand. - Could use a plumber. - I could be back tomorrow morning with my tools. - All right. - Good, see you then. - Whatchu do scare him off with a broom? I can use the exercise. I just live up the road. She's back, Naomi Starkey is back and on the market. - I don't think so. - Ouch! (both laughing) - But I think I need to warn you. There are a few people in town that will not let the truth stand in the way of good rumor. (classic music) (phone rings) - Yes. (laughs) Well, I told you it was going to test positive. Once that soil was unearthed and excavated everything will be fine. I'm sure of it. (laughs) Trust me, I know exactly what the city's trying to do. Who do you think proposed it? (chuckles) Okay, listen, listen, I'll be up there in the morning. I'll see you then, okay. Good night. (classic music continues) (Naomi mumbles) - [Heather] But the girls really wanna meet you, so they have rehearsal tonight, but please feel free to stop by at any time. - [Naomi] Yeah, that would be wonderful, thank you. - [Heather] Sure. Oh, and I put my number in this note, so if you need anything, please don't hesitate to call. - Okay. - Okay see ya. - We'll talk to each other, bye. - [Heather] Bye. (door closes) - Oh hey, how do you feel? - Better. Naomi, who was that? - Oh, that was Heather. Heather Mudrick, she's my niece. - As in your sister's kid. - Mm-hmm, and look what you brought us. Look at here here. Oh no, honey, honey, that's a bank statement. It's associated with the house. You don't need to be concerned about it. - So did you have a meet her before? - Who? - Your niece. - Yeah. Oh man, look what you gave us. You got some pickle and green beans. No, no, no, honey, that's a note that my sister left for me. Heather gave it to me. Apparently she knew I would be back. - Naomi, chicken, fried chicken, West Virginia fried chicken, West Virginia fried chicken. You know, I've only heard of this food. - So my sister, Judy had liver cancer. She had to borrow money against the house to help pay for her medical treatments. That was the last time we talked. Heather told me that. Heather is so beautiful. She looks so much like her mother. Oh my gosh, Judy was beautiful. So she's married now, and she has a house in town. (chuckles) - [Ruth] That's wonderful, Naomi. - Two daughters. (chuckles) - That's great. - Oh, and listen to this. She has a dance studio in downtown Bridgeport. She's invited us to go watch her daughters who happened to be my grandnieces, invited us to watch them dance. Isn't that great? - Yes, you have family in town. - Ruth... we have family in town. Now you gotta try this West Virginia fried chicken. (laughs) (drills whirring) - [Man] Right there. - Well, good morning, sunshine. - Morning, eh. - And who are you? - I'm John, eh, I just live down the road. I'm here helping out. - Just to fix the sink out of the kindness of your own heart. - Yes, ma'am. - This isn't Vegas. - He's a man, isn't he? - Stop. - You want me to fix you a cup of coffee, and some breakfast? I can fix you some eggs. John, brought some fresh farm eggs. - Of course, he did. I'm gonna go into town. Is it okay if I use the van? - Sure. - Do you want anything? - No, I'm good. - Do you wanna come to check out some of the other house stuff? - No, I think I'm good. You go ahead. Have fun. - Okay, I'm gonna leave you guys alone, but John I have your license plate number. - Okay. And I know where you live. - Okay, she's finished. - Great, thanks. (upbeat music) (truck honks) (vehicle honks) (upbeat music continues) - [Judy Voiceover] My dearest, Naomi, my heart is broken knowing that I'll never see you on this earth again. I would give anything just to have one more walk with you. Not even my most painful medicine procedures equal this heartache, but I will see you in heaven, and there we will celebrate with our family. Please don't greet me, and now I'm free. I love you always. Love Judy. Sisters forever and ever. (faucet runs) - You are okay? - [Naomi] Yeah, I'm good. - Can you sit down? - What do you mean, hun? - Can you sit? - Come on, just tell me what you need. - They're gonna put a rec center here. - Here? - Yeah. - Down here? - Yes, on your property. - Hmm, wow. - All right, but don't get mad. - What? Ruth, what did you do? - I went to the bank. - Can I help you? - Yes. I got a notice from the courthouse. Guys are foreclosing on our property. - What property? - The Starkey property. You can't. We can raise the money. I know the city wants to build a whole rec center up on that mountain, under that one little spot. You can't have it. The whole mountain, you don't need the whole mountain. You have to stop. We have one little piece of property. You can't have it. Look Naomi, my mom, my mother-in-law. Naomi Starkey and I we just moved from Vegas. I've done research. I have all the paperwork, and I've been doing my research, and I know, I know, I know the city wants to buy up the entire mountain and that one little spot where we lived, and I know you guys want it for rec center. I can't let that happen. I can't let that happen. - I'm not gonna be able to help you. I'm sorry. Your name again? (bouncy music) - Ruth, I told you that's my business. - Went to city hall. - Anything you need to know about that property's history, is right in this files. - All of it? - Yeah. (bouncy music) - You're new around here? - A lot of excitement up in that area. - [April] Here you go Mr. Mayor. - Thank you, April. - I'm sure I'm gonna run these back to the render to insure 'em, thank you. - Mm-hmm, welcome. (bouncy music) - Yeah, yeah, there's six slots of their city paid for five of them and they cared to market. The only one left is at Baymore right there. 508 Lodge Field road, the bank closed that one. - Not for long. - Hello, this is the files that you requested. They're 10 cents a copy and just pay on your way out. - Oh jeez, I'm sorry. - Sorry, Bo. - Ah jeez, man. I'm sorry about that, thank you. - (laughs) Excuse me, Mr. Mayor. - Hey, Kent. - Listen since we bumped into each other could I get an official comment on the rec center? - (chuckles) Well, nothing official yet but we're hoping to break ground in January. - Have some note's there, Mr. Mayor? - It's an IOU. - IOU. Do you know her, Mr. Mayor? - No, who is she? - And I went to a church. (ambient music) - Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone else was in here. - Sorry, I just wanted to come in. - Well, you can stay. I just have to run out for a minute. - I'm Pastor Wayne. - I'm Ruth. - It's nice to meet you, Ruth. - Nice to meet you too. I just moved here yesterday. I'm from up west. My husband died and I felt like I needed a home. So I left with Naomi, and now we just drove all the way up here, and I'm worried about her, and she's worried about me. But I'm not worried, I mean, it's not good to worry, right? 'Cause I'm still not worried. - Wow! - Yeah, kind of crazy. - No Ruth, wait a second, I'm gonna give you a key to church, and then you can come and pray anytime you want, and you just lock up when you leave. - No offense pastor, but I do not pray enough to get a key to a church, especially this one. - It's no big deal. It is beautiful. - Yes. - Look at this key. Let this key represent your future. See all the cuts, some are deep, some are slight. And look at those cuts as events, trials, and these trials, these hardships are necessary to unlock your future. I believe that. And if we can get by those trials, those cuts, God has wonderful plans for our future. (chuckles) Like each individual cut is unique in your life, and important for your future, and I think your future looks very bright, Ruth. All right. So just hit the lights when you leave. (ambient music) - Do you want me to lock up? - Nah, we never lock up church. (ambient music) - And a nice guy at a diner. - I'm sorry, my name is Will. - Thank you, Will. - Yeah, whatever you need. - For the paper, and the company. - You're very welcome. - It was fun. It was very fun. (laughs) - The card is not good lady, you got another one? - No. - Cash? - No. - You know what? You can't use that, I'm sorry I canceled that card some weeks ago. I expect anyone to have the credit and I, put it in that one. - All right. - You didn't, what? Will, thank you. (piano music) I owe you. I didn't have my credit card, well, I had my credit card and it didn't work, so he bought me breakfast. Can you believe that? He's nice. You said people were really nice. They're so nice here. - Honey-- - You were so right, and I met a cute boy. - Okay Ruth, is there a point to this story, please, please, just get to it. - Naomi, you only owe $45,000. - Oh, only 45. We can find that, where? - Okay. - Find it where? Here? Where are we gonna find it? - Naomi, what do you know about an SOX corporation? - An SOX? - Yes, it's all over this paperwork. All over the property papers, the diagrams, it's everywhere. - I've never heard of it. And by the way what is a rec center? - A recreation center. Ball fields, soccer fields. - Well, that's nice, right? - No, not on your property. Naomi, I have an idea. - What? - How big will the pumpkin's get? - How big is the pump? Well, it depends on soil. It depends on the environment. They can get this to. - But big. But they'll get big. - Yeah, they do. - Okay, we can sell them. We can even make money selling pumpkins. We can make the money selling the pumpkins; Halloween, Thanksgiving. People will buy pumpkins. We can make all of the money. I can do posters. We can do marketing. We can do advertising. People will pay money for pumpkins, and we can sell them to make this money. - Ah Ruth, can we talk about this later? Heather called me earlier, and she invited us to the dance, a studio to watch the girls practice, do you wanna go? - Yes, but when you think about this idea? - Honey, let's talk about it later, okay? I have an ache, I'm tired, okay? So I tell you what? You go change, because I have a feeling that you probably turned a few heads in Oak Ridge Port, West Virginia with that outfit. All right, can you do that? Thank you, honey. A SOX, rec center, what the heck is a SOX? (upbeat music) (audience applauds) Bravo. - That's so good. - That was good. - That was amazing. - That was good. - Come to the house, Ruth. - Oh, I was sure that they had friends. - Friends no. - Well, it is a long night. - We would love to join you. - Okay, we would stop by the house for a buffet. - Five o'clock. - All right well, let's get cooking. - We'll be there. (women giggling) (indistinct) - Naomi, this is for you and for you too, Ruth. Naturally Heather told me and I was very sad to hear about the boys and your husband. - Thank you. - How are things up at the old house? I mean, do you need anything? - You know, I think we're okay. - It's because she already has a handyman. - Listen, I'll say the grace and then we'll eat. Dear Jesus, we love you, and we thank you for Naomi and for Ruth, and for getting them here safely. Dear Lord, I pray that they find happiness in the midst of all this heartache. Dear Father, please bless our bodies. Please bless our food, and dear Father please bless us into the high service. Amen. - [All] Amen. - Amen. - So y'all have any plans? - We have a pumpkin patch. - Excuse me? - We have to do something. The bank is kicking us out, and I figure if we sell pumpkins over Thanksgiving, and Halloween we'll have enough money. - I didn't know that the bank had set a date. - Yep, December 15th, we're out by then. - Can we talk about this later, please? I'm sorry. - Look, maybe we can pay the bank back, we sell pumpkins over the weekends. The pumpkins should be coming ripe in the next week or two and it's perfect time, and yet give it a shot. But if you ask me all that craziness up on the mountain, fishy. - Hmm, how come? - Just the Perez name on it and all. Do you know that your mom she was a- - Jason? - You know what I mean? - Who's the Perez family. - Solomon Perez and Boaz Perez. Sal, he owns the bank, and Boaz, they call him, Bo, he owns the town. - He doesn't own the town, he is the mayor. - Tall guy. Black hair. - Yeah. - Handsome. - Naomi no, do not go there. Stop, no. Stop it. In the meantime I need a job. Any ideas? - Actually, you know what? The church they're looking for someone for their daycare. It's a part time position, but you might be interested. - That would be wonderful. - Thank you. - Perfect for you. - Yeah. - Yeah, you would be so good at that. - Thank you. - The rec center. There's a motion on the floor to approve the budget for the rec center, $42 million. Is there a second? - [Man] We second. - We got a second, okay. As you can see here, the rec center is gonna cover an area of about 500 square meters. It's gonna have volleyball, basketball courts. You could see the entire community will be able to access at the recreation center. - [Man] Mr. Mayor, you mentioned ground zero. Can we please talk about sulfur dioxide for a moment? - Ooh, we, that's a very interesting question, Kent. (tense music) (Ruth sighs) Hey Dan. No, I totally understand, but how much longer. Okay. Thank you. - I have the newspaper wanting to comment on the rec center. What do you wanna say? - Is it Kent again? Look, tell him that, you know, we don't have any follow announcement yet, but we hope to break ground in January, we might tell him something more around December. - Okay, I will tell him. - But we will have a more formal announcement coming. - What do you think about officially announcing the recreation center at Light Up Night? - That's kinda brilliant. Right after Thanksgiving, I love it. Thank you, April. Very well done. Hey, you wouldn't happen to know, Ruth? Ruth? - Forget it. Forget it, thank you. - Okay. (birds chirping) - I think it would be easier if we just put a slide on the stairs, Naomi. - [Naomi] Oh no, don't break your ankle. (Ruth laughs) - Ta-da! - Wow, you are up early. - I'm going to the church, you know the day care job. - Oh. - How do I look? - You look good. I made some coffee, go help yourself. - All right look, don't think I'm crazy. - [Naomi] Mm, what? - I did some research - mm-hmm. - on the farms around here. - Mm-hmm. - There is no farm owned by a John guy. - Well, maybe it's under the name, Jonathan. - No, no, Jonathan. - Mm what. - Look, just be careful. I don't trust him. There's something about him, Naomi. Please, just trust me on this. - Just him? - Do you need anything from the store? - No, I think I'm good. - Okay. Wish me luck. - Knock 'em dead. (kids playing) - Hi. - Hi, I'm looking for a job. I heard you were hiring. - We're not really hiring in the kitchen right now, but I can go get you an application, and you can bring it back later. - No, I wanted to be a teacher. - Teacher. - I have a resume. - We just don't really just hire teachers off the street. - No, but I have a key, yes, to the church. - You have a key to the church. - Hi. It's Ruth right? - Will. - What are you doing here? - I'm looking for a job - Oh. - as a teacher. - Oh, well we do have some openings. - I'm the principal, so let's go talk in my office. - The principle. - Yes. - Oh my. - I'm in charge of everything. - [Ruth] Wow. - Mr. Mayor, tell me, are you buying all the land on the mountain, are you really gonna build a rec center? - We are talking about it, thinking about it, so maybe, but I can tell you this, we will have a much more formal announcement about all of this on Light Up Night. - Thank you. - Appreciate it. - Okay, so if you just sign right here at the bottom then I'll take care of the paperwork, and then here is your key card that'll get you into school. It won't get you in the church, but that's never locked anyway. Any questions? - Tomorrow, right? - Morning classes only. - Thank you. I will not let you down. Well, thank you for everything. - My pleasure. - I am so excited, thank you. - Okay, have a great day. (giggles) (sighs) (upbeat music) - So I'll be able to make anything with these? - Oh yeah, yeah. - Yeah, what do you make of this? - Banana peppers, I like the stuff. - Really? - Yeah. - Oh, you like to cook. - A little too, yeah, you know, I'm certainly not a gourmet. - Cool, very good. - I like a little variety. - Yeah. - Well, then this is such a beautiful plant. (camera shutters) (suspense music) - I'll take the green ones. - Yeah. - I like the green ones. - Yeah, they're the good ones. - Who is that? - I'll go take care of it. (birds chirping) (suspense music) (Ruth sighs) (kids laughing) - Things are not always as they appear in small towns. Naomi had warned me about this. You see as excited as we were about this new venture, someone or something was about to ruin our plans. (jolly music) Well, we opened the pumpkin patch. It was so exciting. Finally, we could start getting our lives together. Naomi and Ruth's Pumpkin Patch. - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Bo. - Well, Bo. - No, no, my name is Bo, Boaz Perez. We met at the records room here in (mumbles). - You're following me. - No, no, no, no, no, no, you gave me an IOU. This remember. - Yeah, so you're telling me to collect. - No, no, I'm messing this up. - I literally just wanted to say hi, that's all I wanna meet you, that's the whole truth. - The truth? Well, I'm pretty convinced that you're a species that's incapable of truth. So you wanna try again? - (laughs) Look, I invite you for coffee, or better yet two for one hotdogs at Tino. - Seriously? - They're the best in town. - I'll tell you what Mr. Bo, it's mayor, right? - Bo, is fine. - So I read your article. Breaking ground in January. Kids will be playing soccer by summer. - Yeah. - Over my dead body. (suspense music) (birds chirping) (Naomi chuckles) - I am so proud of you. Ruth, we're gonna be okay. - I ran into the mayor today. - Who? I hear he's handsome. - He's all right. (guitar music) Hey guys. - Hello. - It's $10 a pumpkin in any size. $10, any size. - Enjoy. - Have fun. Naomi, this is gonna work. - I hope so. - Yes. You put too much work into it. - It's gonna work. - Mum? Mums, we can't find any good pumpkins. They are all rotten. - Oh, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, sir. - Okay. - Ruth, what happened? - I don't know. - I hope it's just that one. Did you check the patch his morning? - Yes, no, I checked. Naomi, it was fine. (somber music) That next morning I checked the pumpkin patch. They were ruined, rotted. I was devastated. Everything we worked so hard for, gone. And guess who had the guts to come by? The last person I wanted to see. (suspense music) - What's going on? - I don't know. You can tell your dad he won. - I don't know anything about that. - I can't talk about, Boaz. - You know, Kent. - The reporter. - Yeah, why does he keep asking me about contaminated soil up on the mountain. - What mountain? - Dad, come on. - (laughs) Son, there's nothing to worry about. Once we get to circulate the soil, everything will be just fine. - Circulating this, dad, I'm the mayor of this town. This is my town, I'm responsible for this. I'm not somebody you can just schmooze over by saying circulate the soil. What does that even mean? - Son, we own all of the land. I'm up there on the mountain every day overseeing. - You own all the land. - Yes. Yes, Ido. - Who are you calling? - I met this girl, and she says- - Ruth? You know she's from Vegas. - Dad. - Her husband died recently. Son, I'd be very careful. - Yeah, Ruth. Hey, yeah, it's Bo. Look, I'm speaking here with my father right now. Would you mind meeting me in my office? Yeah. - Can I help you? - Is the mayor here? - Let me check. - The mayor is here. - [Ruth] Okay, I'll admit it, Boaz was handsome. He was rich. He was everything a woman dreamed of. At first of course, I wanted to know more about this rec center and his dad, but as we started talking all that became, well, not important. (Solomon knocks) (ominous music) - Thank you for inviting me in, Naomi. (sighs) You know, I was very sorry to hear about your sister's death, and your husband, and your boys. My own wife passed away about three years ago. - Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about that, Mr. Perez. - Please call me, Sal. - Sal. - You know after something like that happens it's hard to find our bearings. Sometimes we just need a change. - Yeah. Well, I really do wanna say thank you for lending my sister the money against the house. That is why you're here, right? - Yes, and your friend, Ruth. She wanted to pay the loan. My son is very fond of her. Do you really wanna stay in this old house, Naomi? - Mr. Perez, it's all that I know here. - You know, the city would like to make a park of some sort out of it. - A rec center, I know. (chuckles) - What if I were to offer you $50,000 for it right now? We would forget about the foreclosure, and your sister's death, and where you could take the money and you could get a fresh start. We'll even move your family cemetery to the city cemetery. They have some beautiful plots right up on top of the hill. My own wife, Rahab, she's buried there. - Are you serious? - Yes, I'm very happy that you're back, Naomi. I hope you'll stay. - Why are you doing this? - I just wanna help. (Naomi sobs) You know, I have a contract right here along with a check. What do you say we get this taken care of today? (Naomi sobs) Do you think you could be out next week? - Naomi. - Yes. - I have to tell you some news. - Me first, I have some good news. - What, what is it? - We sold the house. Ruth, we sold the house. (piano music) - You what? - Mr. Perez, came over, right, and he bought the house. We don't have foreclose on it, Ruth. He even said he's gonna move the family cemetery, and he gave us $50,000. - When? - I don't know about an hour ago. - Why? - Because he wanted to help. - He wanted to help, since when do men wanna help, Naomi. Men don't wanna help. You sold our house. What have we worked so hard for? You sold our house. - Just stop it. Stop it, Ruth. Don't, you know, $50,000 can change our life. - I know, yeah, yeah, and I'm sure he knows that, Naomi. Why do you think he wants to buy the house? Why do you think he came over? Why did you just wait until it was foreclosed on, then he could have gotten it free and clear. Gosh dern it Naomi! When will you learn your lesson? Men, will always take advantage. (piano music) - What did you want to tell me? - That's it. That's why he took me to the city. I'm an idiot. I'm such a fool. I thought I was the only woman with a key. - Naomi, said you left mad, and so I thought you might come here. - Why do you want a rec center? And you better be a 100% honest with me. - Ruth, I would never lie to you. - Answer the question. - I want a place for kids to be able to come together and play. That's it. - Okay, why does your dad want a rec center so bad? - Honestly, I don't know. - Yeah, I wanted to know more about this rec center, and his dad. But as we started talking, - My mother - All of that became not important. - My mother used to be, well, she had a house in town, in the city. - He made me laugh. - Out of town. - He made me feel safe, - Well, I wasn't happy so- - and he showed me who he really was. We talked, and talked about our dreams, our hopes. - No. - I was falling in love with him. I was doing the thing I promised I would never do again. We talked all night. In fact, we fell asleep at the church that night. (piano music) (camera shutters) - I can't believe we fell a sleep in here. Hey. (piano music) (laughs) - I hope they say I (mumbles). - No. (piano music) - Albert? Do you wanna join us for the story. Hi. - SO two. SOX. - Sulfur dioxide. The emissions are radical. (tense music) - Let's have a talk. (suspense music) (Bo whistles) - What? - It's all over Facebook. - What, what is? - You, Ruth. (suspense music) - Oh my. (sighs) - Velco quickly release. - Yes, it's true. Yep. (tense music) - I am so sorry, Naomi. I fell asleep in the church, but I have to find something. - Are you okay? - [Ruth] I'm fine I just need to find something. - You would have called. - (knocks) Hello. - Now who in the world is this? Can I help you? - Hi. - Naomi, Naomi, look, look, look. This is it. - What is it? - Look, where it reads, SOX. SOX, it stands for sodium dioxide. - That it, that's it, that is what under the ground, and that's what they've been trying to hide. - That's what killed the pumpkins. - Yes. - These Hills must be full of sodium dioxide, SOX. - Who are you? - Okay, so the Perez family bought up all this land to get rid of Sodium dioxide, but they set it on a rec center. - Would you get out. - Did the mayor tell you all of this when you slept together last night. - What? - We're gonna pop up Perez, aiming bought up all this land. - I did not, I did not. Get out of here. - I just want the truth. - It's a lie. - No, that's not true. John, who do you work for? - I work for an environmental group in DC. - So you just used us. - What? - Look, I want to tell you. - No. - Naomi. - Naomi, I told you. - Naomi, wait. Please wait. If you just let me explain. - You lied to me. - Let me explain. I know I lied to you, but the things that I did. - [Ruth] Did I believe God had a plan? No, not at all. I had made myself hope again. Love again. I had opened myself up and look what happened. Life was not going to get any better for me. I got fired. I got humiliated. How could I have trusted him? I decided to go back to Vegas. - Ruth, you forgot your purse. - Yeah, thanks Heather. - What time does your bus leave tonight? - At seven. - We're gonna miss you. - Sure with the stories, right? Crazy, I'm ready for Vegas. - Naomi is going to miss you. - Heather, I'm coming back to visit. I'm not going away forever. - No, you won't. - Hot off the press. We didn't have anything to do with it. - You lied to me, John. - Lied maybe, but read the article. His father was the one behind all of it. I truly don't believe he had anything to do with it. - John, I'm sorry, but what are you gonna do about the mountain? - Clean it up. We'll get it done. - We put some of those things into storage, but do not forget about Light Up Night tonight. - I'll be there, you go. - See you there. - All right. - Is she talking about Light Up Night. - Yeah. - With the Christmas tree? - Yeah, remember when I told you about that? (chuckles) It was their first night here. (somber music) Ruth. - Don't, do not make me cry. - I'm sorry, but I'm gonna miss you. - Aa-aah. Mm-mmh. Nope. No, I am not going to look at you then I won't leave. - Why are you being so stubborn? (both sobbing) I love you, you know that. (somber music) My girl. (somber music) (Ruth exhales) - You know tonight is Light Up Night? - I heard. - What are you doing? - I'm waiting for my bus. What? (ambient music) - Sure is it's right there. (kid laughs) (ambient music) - [Man] Nine. Eight. One. Merry Christmas. (crowd cheers) (fireworks goes off) (audience cheers) - We get into the festivities tonight. I promised that I'd make a formal announcement about the rec center. The recreation center is moving forward; (audience cheering) however, its location has been moved to a much better and cleaner area of town. This Christmas let's celebrate our families. Good, bad, whatever. May we all learn to love each other better. Merry Christmas. (audience cheers and applauds) (jolly music) (audience cheers) - [Ruth] Mr. Perez, totally full paid off the house. It was hers to keep as well as the check for 50,000 as compensation for the damage to the land. Bo, was devastated to hear about the contamination. As for never trust in man, maybe there's still some hope. (suspense music) - Isn't it beautiful? - It's so pretty. - Ruth, I'm so glad you're staying. I couldn't bear not having you in my life. You are my daughter. (both laughing) - Naomi, I am so sorry. - Why? - The way I acted. I wasn't really gonna leave you. - I know it. We have a home. (laughs) We can settle down. Maybe you'll get married. Have some children, and grandchildren, and great, great grandchildren. (both laughing) And who knows, maybe one of them will save the world. (laughs) (ominous music) (ambient music) - And I did get married. married to a loving and wonderful man. My life, my journey, it was complete. I found love. And as for Naomi's journey, she too found what she needed... a family. ♪ Oh, I want to feel something ♪ ♪ I just wanna breath again ♪ ♪ Dive into the deep instead ♪ ♪ Oh I wanna feel something ♪ ♪ Let me get back in my body ♪ ♪ Oh, I wanna knock in heavens ♪ ♪ I know he lives for me ♪ ♪ I wanna breath again ♪ ♪ Oh, I wanna feel something ♪ ♪ I just wanna breath again ♪ ♪ Talking to the deep instead ♪ ♪ Oh, I wanna something ♪ ♪ Something good ♪ ♪ Something good ♪ ♪ Something good ♪ ♪ Oh I wanna feel something ♪ ♪ Something ♪
