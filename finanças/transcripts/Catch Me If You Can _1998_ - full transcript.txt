(upbeat funky music) - Extra, extra, read all about it! Paper, get your paper! Paper anyone? Anyone want a paper? Paper, sir? Read about the Pope's surprise marriage. - Yeah, I'll take one thanks. I don't see anything about... Hey! Hey, that kid took my wallet! Hey! Stop! - Okay, let's see what good old Horace Winston's donating. It's a long way from 10 grand. (tires screeching) - Richie, why don't you come down here and talk? I hear you just love to talk. - Hey, come on guys, I didn't do anything. - [Man] Well that's not what I heard. I heard you've been bragging about hijacking one of the man's delivery boys. - Look, I didn't steal anything from Benoit. I'm not that stupid. Come on guys, do I look like I got a death wish here? - Yeah, you do. (gun blasting) - Won't be a problem for the boss anymore. (tires screeching) (muffled crosstalk) - Alright, what have we got here? - Homicide, looks professional. - Yeah, we'll draw the conclusions around here officer. Thank you. Any witnesses? - A couple of people heard the shots. Saw a car pull away but nobody saw it go down. - Sure this guy is dead? Could have sworn I heard some breathing. - You come on down here! Oscar, you've been up there for two hours. (tires screeching) - This is a fucking ugh! - You again! Why do I always get you? - Well it just seems that I happen to be the officer in charge of matters totally unrelated to police work. So your cat again, huh? - Oscar's been up there for two hours. They said they'd send somebody right over. But I wait and I wait and I wait--- - Yeah, yeah, I know, I know. - But does anybody come? No, the real policemen are out chasing bank robbers and murderers. - I got it lady, I--- - And all I get is the department reject who shows up looking like some bum off the street. - Okay already. Now I will take this crap from downtown because they sign my pay check. But you, I don't need it from. So if you don't mind, I got a date with a bottle of Pepto Bismol and a crossword puzzle. - Hey, what about Oscar? I'm going to report you. You can't just leave him up there. - Okay. (gun blasting) (cat meowing) There's your Oscar. - So you're Horace Winston. Got a gold card, Horace. And a Visa. And a Diners Club. - Hey, I like to entertain. - How do you explain this? - A really bad haircut. - Now son, we really don't care how you got the wallet. What we're interested in is a murder. So why don't you tell me everything you saw. - Nothing, now can I go? - Look kid, it's not very nice for little boys like you to tell lies. Now if you don't cooperate with me, I could be very hard on you. I could phone your parents. I could get you expelled from school. But you know what the worst thing I could do to you? - Sit on me? - Listen, you little punk, you want this to get nasty? (grunts) Oh my eye, my eye. (Nathan snickering) That hurts. (soft music) - Hey sugar. - That wasn't fair. - Hi! - Captain's looking for you. - Is it about those missing IAD files or the Crandall case? - Nope, for some reason neither one of those things has happened to make it into your file yet. - You know, you are really something else. Why is it that we have never gotten together yet? - Because you have no life, no future. You're completely self destructive and you refuse to do anything about it. - You're gonna let that stop you? Thanks, Tina. - Gannon, you look like crap. What's the matter, rehab not working out? - Speaking of not working out. - Hey, real funny pal. - Alright, knock it off. Norm, Greeden and Murdoch here are working on the homicide of a John Doe and we have a potential witness that needs protection. - Wow murder witness, sure okay. Where is he? What? (scoffs) Not the kid! - It's only until we ID him and find his family. I'm not gonna put him in lock up overnight. - Overnight? No look, I don't know anything about kids. I don't babysit 'em, no. No, no, no! Look... Norm Gannon will only stoop so low. (country guitar music) You into this hippidy hopsy? (Nathan moaning) What's the matter? - Oh nothing. (Nathan groaning loudly) - What, what, are you okay? - Yeah, I'll be okay, it's just... (Nathan moaning loudly) - What? - Well, I haven't had anything to eat today and I'm feeling a little faint. - You're gonna be okay 'til we get home though, right? - Oh sure, sure. Unless I throw up! (tires screeching) (children laughing and muffled crosstalk) - This is your favorite restaurant? - Hi, welcome to Hungry Hippos. I'm Hal. Any pf you (mumbles) have any questions? - Yeah, this place got a liquor license? (Hal sniggering) Bring me a cup of coffee. What are you lookin' at? - Those things. - Oh, my handcuffs. You never seen handcuffs before? Well this goes around one wrist then this flips around the other one see. Then you can't get out without the key. - Sweet, can I see 'em? - Yeah. Hey, hey! Now you don't wanna be doing that, kid. Hey who did that? One of you guys do that? Come on now, somebody can get hurt. Guys, you can't be doing this alright. No, no, no, no, no, you don't wanna be doing that because it's not... What are you doing? - You're a detective, you figure it out. - No, no come on. Come on, you can't do that. - Not only can I, I did. I won, you lost; see ya. - No, kid, come back here. (Norm grunting) (children laughing) It's okay, I'm a cop. He stole my wallet? Kid! (intriguing music) (rhythmic music) (muffled crosstalk) Hi this is Detective Norman Gannon of the 12th Precinct. Yeah, we have a report of a missing credit card and I want you to check and see if anybody has used it to purchase anything in the last couple of hours. The name on the credit card is Norman Gannon. Yeah okay, it's my credit card. Would you just check on it please? Thank you. (Nathan burping) - And here is the other chocolate mousse that you ordered, Master Gannon. - Thanks, man. - And thank you so much for the generous tip. - No prob, Bob. - Will there be anything else, Master Gannon? - No, I'm totally stuff--- - Aww, what's the matter kid? Lose your appetite, huh? (whimsical music) Come on home with me. - Come on! - Hey, who's the loser now, huh kid? I believe you've got something that belongs to me. Let's see. Oh, what's this? Look what I found. Oh, does that hurt? Gee, I'm so sorry. - Let go of me! You're gonna pay for this, you know. Better get ready to face one big lawsuit. - Yeah, well lawsuits cost more money than you've got. Unless of course you come from a wealthy family. Do ya? - Let's just say I don't have to live in a dump like this. Oh jeez, what died in here? - Last kid I brought home. Hey, hey, hey, do you mind? I like it this way. - You're gonna give me some of that, right? - I already bought you dinner. - You got a bathroom here? - Yeah, right... Oh no, no, no, no, no. Forget about it, kid. You're not gonna pull that old slip out the bathroom window routine on me. - But I have to go. - Oh oh oh, tough. - Well I guess in this dump, it doesn't really matter where I go. - Okay okay okay, you win, you win. It's right there. You got 30 seconds. - [Norm] Hey kid, why don't you tell me who your parents are? (ice cubes rattling) 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. (toilet flushing) You have a long drop out that window, huh kid? You got a problem? - I don't. (Norm sighing) These your folks? - Yeah. - Here's a free tip, I'd keep this in a drawer. Who's the squeeze? - That happens to be my ex wife, Trish. Just keep your hands off that if you don't mind. - Why'd you guys split? Intimacy problems? - Oh this is gonna be a long night. - Hmm looks like you used to have a pretty good life. How'd you screw it up? - Jeez you ask a lot of questions. - No really, I mean with all these medals and stuff, how'd you get stuck looking after me? - Just blind luck I guess. Now look kid, unless you're gonna tell me a lot about yourself, I think it's your bedtime. - Yeah right, what are you gonna do, make me? Whoa! - Yup. - You bum! I just wish my father was here; he'd kick your butt. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - If he found out how you've been treating me, he'd finish you off in about oh, five seconds. - Ah huh. Your father really cared about you, don't you think he'd have reported you missing? Hey kid, I'm sorry. - The only reason he hasn't reported me missing is 'cause he doesn't know I am missing. He thinks I'm at summer camp. They think I'm at home. - So now I know you're rich and you go to summer camp. The mystery unravels. - If I'm telling the truth. - I thought you kids from the suburbs always tell the truth. - Nice try but that's not where I live. (Norm laughing) - So you just went to the bus station just to see the scenery? - Sherby's Motel stinks here. - You're gonna go to bed in your clothes? - Makes for a quicker escape. - Don't worry, I got that solved. (handcuffs clicking) - Hey you can't do that. - No, why not? - 'cause what if there's a fire, huh? I'd be a helpless carcass of charred flesh, they'd arrest you for child endangerment and they'd hang you 'til your neck snapped like a twig. - Yeah well you're forgettin' one thing, there ain't gonna be a fire. (bulb shattering) (flames crackling) - Fire, fire, fire! (screams) Someone call the fire department. (screams) Fire! I love the smell of burnt wool in the evening. It smells so much like victory. - Oh yeah? Okay. Now you die, I die. Looks like victory is mine after all, huh? - So now you're real special now. - Gimme a pillow. - Sure. (rhythmic music) (intriguing music) (car horn honking) - So what about the money? - Look I haven't found the money yet, right. So what? Look, it's not like they're gonna trace it back here, are they? - They can trace it to my bank. And what about the kid? The cops think he saw something in the alley. - [Thug] The kid saw nothing, believe me. - I believe you, ha! He didn't even know he was there. - Look, they assigned some screw-up to look after the kid: Gannon. After what you did to him, he won't be any problem. How much can a kid know, right? - I'm not gambling my future career on the wishful thinking of some incompetent. - What do you want me to do about the kid, sir? - Kill him. (ominous music) (gun blasting) (Norm breathing heavily) - Good morning, Norm. (muffled crosstalk) - Yeah here he is, signed, sealed, and delivered ending yet another exciting chapter in my life as a cop. - Actually Norm. - What? - [Tina] The captain wants you to keep him another day. - What? - He can't get an ID on him. - Come on come on, enough is enough with this kid. - Will this help? - What, a donut? You think you can buy me with a donut? - I tried. - Is it chocolate? - [Tina] Chocolate glazed with sprinkles. - [Norm] How did you know I had a thing for chocolate donuts? - [Tina] Norm, you eat them every day. - Hey, what are you doin'? Whaddya, get outta there, you little weasel! That's my file! - Come on Norm, I don't blame you for bein' ticked. I would too if I was only making 37 grand a year. So, what happened in '95? - Nothing. - Then why did they make you see a shrink? - Molly dearest. - [Molly] Go two Charlie nine. - Has anything, anything turned up on young Damien here? - [Molly] Nothing Norm, the kid's still a mystery. (muffled crosstalk) (foreboding music) - Gimme your hand. Come on, give me the hand. - Come on, this is getting old. - Well isn't that tough. I gotta go inside. - How come I can't come in with you? - Because your not part of my routine. You see, every morning I take my crossword puzzle. I go inside and I do it while I'm sittin' on the throne. Perhaps, just perhaps I get a couple of moments of peace and quiet. - This really really stinks. - Aw gee, that's too bad because there's not a thing you can do about it. But don't worry, I'll be back in a flush. Get it? A flush. - No, it went right over my head. - (chuckles) Hey, that's not too tight. (intriguing music) - Hey gimme a BLT will ya? And double up on the pickles. - Hey Norm. (foreboding music) - [Norm] Alone at last. - Molly dearest. - [Molly] Go two Charlie nine. What's with the whispering, Norm? - I'm in the middle of a major bust. I need backup, plenty of it fast. - [Molly] What's the location? - Danny's Coffee Shop. - [Norm] A four letter word for malicious. (foreboding music) (muffled crosstalk) (tires screeching) - Sweet! - [Norm] First E blank blank L. (chuckles) Got it, evil. - [Cop] Freeze, one move and you're a dead man! (cops laughing) - Just keep this quiet. (rhythmic music) - How was your peace and quiet? - I've had better. - (gasps) What did you put on this thing? - You did ask for double peppers, didn't ya? (Norm laughing) (ominous music) Where ya goin'? - You mind? I don't feel too good. - Ah no wonder. Yeah I guess that must be a pretty sick feeling to suddenly realize that you have come up against the master! (laughs) What am I doin'? (phone ringing) Yeah? - Norm! I've been lookin for you for the past hour. - Yeah you know what, I think I misplaced my cell. - [Tina] I have some good news for you. You are being reassigned. - Well it's about time. What, did they find the kid's parents? - No, but they've IDed the murder victims. Seems like he was a small-timer who ripped off a courier. Guess who? Your old friend Jean Benoit. They think the kid may be in real danger so just in case, they wanna make sure he's secure. - What, Bernasky doesn't think I can handle it? - Norm, I thought you'd be glad to get rid of him. - Yeah, yeah of course I am. It's be nice to get my life back. Yeah alright, I'll bring the kid in within the hour. Bye, Tina. (rhythmic music) Hey hot stuff, your time's up. - Oh man. Oh man. - Kid, I know you're okay, so stop foolin' around. (Nathan breathing heavily) Hey you got to three to open that door or I'm comin' in. One, two, (Nathan groaning) three. Here I come. - Yes. - Kid, kid! Kid! Hey kid! Kid! Kid! - Oh my God, get outta here! (tires screeching) Get outta the way! Get outta the darn way! - Hey, I'm a policeman! Cool out. (muffled crosstalk) (rhythmic music) (soft intriguing music) - May I help you. - I'd like a room please. - Oh would you? (chuckles) And just why would I give you a room? - Is this a good enough reason? Sweet. Nice. (energetic guitar music) Oh yeah! (rhythmic video game music) (muffled TV broadcast) - [Woman On TV] Do something like this. Bob, thank you so much. I can't believe it's really comin' true. I don t know if I'm dreaming (mumbles). - [TV Reporter] The 24 hour journey from Southeast Asia and (mumbles) on a suburb of Providence, Rhode Island, where sometime today they'll wake up to jet lag, snow, fast food, and the (mumbles). - Tina. - Norm, where have you been? The captain's been climbing the walls. I... (clears throat) - Where is the kid? - [Man] Whatcha talkin' 'bout, man? No, I didn't do it! - I misplaced him. - What? (sighs) Oh no. - When is the captain back? - [Tina] Any minute. (phone ringing) - Yeah Gannon. - [Nathan] Hi Norm. I was kinda gettin' bored so of course I phoned you. - Kid, is that you? - [Nathan] Please, from now on, it's the master. (laughs) - Okay laugh all you want to now, but then you gotta come back in. - [Nathan] Yeah, well I wouldn't wait up me. - Kid look, I'm dead serious. Things have changed. You may be in real danger out there. - [Nathan] Yeah, right. - Look, I'm telling you. That murder you saw, some heavy duty guys were connected to it; guys that may be looking for you right now. - [Nathan] Nice bluff, Norm. I should be falling for it any year now. - Kid I'm begging you, please. - [Nathan] You admit I won? - Yes yes, sure, whatever. - [Nathan] I want you to say it. - Okay okay, you won. - [Nathan] I want you to say that I'm the Normanator and you're just a lowly butthead. - What? - [Nathan] I'm the Normanator and you're just a lowly butthead. Say it! - Alright (clears throat) you're the Normanator and I'm just a lowly butthead, okay? - [Nathan] Louder. - Alright, you're the Normanator and I am just a lowly butthead. (cops laughing) Alright there, I said it. Now, are you coming in or not? - [Nathan] Not a chance. - Look kid, this is not a game any more. - [Nathan] Oh yes it is. Now if you want me, you're gonna have to find me. - Look now hold on, alright alright. The city is a pretty big playground out there. You're gonna have to give me some clues. - [Nathan] And why would I do that? - Just to be fair and especially since you're dealing with a lowly butthead like me. - [Nathan] True. Tell you what, I'll tell you something and you tell me something. - Yeah sure, anything. - [Nathan] What happened in '95? - Look, I am not going into that right now. - [Nathan] Fine with me; we'll do it later then. - No kid, hold on, hold on. Just gimme a minute to think about it okay? You're kidding me, right? - No, why? - This is my place. Alright kid, I will play your game. - [Nathan] Good, I'm waiting Norm. Just come and get me. The game is called hide and seek. So if you want me, you're gonna have to find me. - You're on. (ominous music) (rhythmic music) Busted. (upbeat disco music) Rat! (Norm screaming) (phone ringing) Yeah? - [Nathan] Ready to give? - Why are you doing this to me? Can't you pick on somebody your own size? - [Nathan] Yeah, but it's not nearly as much fun as picking on you. Norm, you're ruining that tie. Oh by the way, I borrowed your cell phone. Did you need it? - As a matter of fact I do, you little psychotic maniac. - Then I guess you're gonna hate the other thing I borrowed. - You didn't. - Check for yourself. See? - No no I don't, where? - [Nathan] On the bookshelf, you fool. Don't you remember? - Oh you know me, I don't know where anything is around here. - [Nathan] Why are you getting fainter? - Fainter? I don't know what you're talking about. (funky disco music) Kid! Alright kid, come out. Come out, wherever you are. Alright, come out of there now. I am warning you. Make me come in there to get you, you will not live to see puberty! You have just made a very big mistake. - That's funny. I bet somebody looking at this right now would see it the other way around. - You listen to me, you little creep. You let me out of here, right now! - You sure? - Yes, I'm sure. - Are you positive? - Yes, I am positive. - Say pretty please with a cherry on top. (Norm grunting loudly) Say it. - Pretty please with a cherry on top. - Okay. (Norm grunting loudly) - Hello? Yes, I'd like to report this crazy man who seems to have locked himself in a dumpster. 16th and Belmont. Alright, thanks. Don't worry Norm, they should be here in about 10 minutes. - You're gonna pay for this. Big time, big big time. - And who's gonna make me? You? I don't think so. You see, the game's over and I won. Game set and match. See ya, Norm. - Kid kid, don't, don't go. Come back, kid (mumbles). (ominous music) (muffled crosstalk) - There was a time you were the best cop on this force. When you set your sights on Benoit, I thought he was as good as done. But we're a long way from that now, aren't we? Norm, Bobby made his own decision that day. I think it's time you made yours. (foreboding music) (glass shattering) - Okay Kid, where could you be? - Alright, listen up people. Our number one priority today is to find this boy, especially before the press gets hold of it and we end up looking like a bunch of--- - Bunch of Norm Gannons? (cops sniggering) - Alright, Greeden and Murdoch are going to be spearheading the operation. We're gonna hit every train station, bus station, homeless shelter, child aid center. - [Norm] It won't work. - Well Norm Gannon, you made roll call. To what do we owe this great pleasure? - That is to tell you, you won't find the kid this way. Look I know, I know my credibility is runnin' pretty low right now. But I do know this kid better than anyone else around here. And I gotta tell you, you're chances of finding this kid in a hostel or a shelter are about as good as finding a Lean Cuisine in Murdoch's freezer. (cops laughing) Look this kid, he knows how to get his hands on money. He travels strictly first class. So if it was me, I'd start at anything with five stars in front of it. Work down from there. That is how you're gonna find this kid. (funky disco music) - [Nathan] Good going, Norm. (intriguing music) - High score, NT. Gotcha. Okay okay, we got something. He was at the Bedford Hotel, registered under the name of Skip Rockefeller. Paid in cash, $100 bills. Told the desk clerk his dad coming in the next day. But I just missed him. Anyway, I found out his initials, NT. He left them on a video game he was playing. - Alright, why don't you run it over to missing persons. See what their fancy computer can come up with. Hey detective, good job. - Thank you, sir. - My contact at the Precinct tells me our new friend is alive and well. Spending a lot of my money. - [Thug] The kids been kinda hard to track down. - I thought I told you to take care of this kid? I want you to do it. Now. (rhythmic music) (door knocking) - Yes? - I live down the street. Well my dad does but he's not home right now. He's at work, so I'm kind of locked out. - Oh. - I was wondering if I... I'm Norm by the way. - It's nice to meet you Norman, I'm Trish. Well alright, why don't you come in and wait for your dad here? - Sure it's alright? - Yeah, I'm sure it's okay. Come on in. - Sorry I have to do this. I'm kind of new at this visiting stuff. See my parents just got divorced. I'm not really used to it, people being divorced. - Well I am. In fact, my ex husband's name is Norman. - No way, really? - Yeah. You wanna sit? - Sure. - So listen, you hungry for something? - Sure. - Okay, I'll be right back. - So why'd you guys split? - Pardon me? - You and Norm, what went wrong? - I don't know. It didn't. - Wasn't anything weird was it? - No, although he did have his quirks. - Like? - You're awfully curious about somebody you don't even know. - Hey, what can I say? Some day I want my own talk show. So? - I don't know. Nothing serious, I mean... Well for instance, the way he kept house. Or the way he would use his tie as a napkin even in the best restaurants. - Sounds embarrassing. - No, nothing embarrassed Norm. - Really, nothing? - Well not much. I do remember how red he got when his mom called him dimples. Or how choked up he got when he tried to do something sweet. All he would come out with is this cute little cough. Oh God, this must be boring for you. - No no, sounds like a pretty interesting guy. - Yeah, yeah he was. - Something happened? - Back about three years ago. - What was it? - No, I don't think so. It's not a very nice story. Hey, how about some more cookies? - Okay. I'm gonna call my dad, see if he's home. - Okay. - Hey Kelly, present for ya. Single malt. (phone ringing) Yeah, Gannon here. - [Nathan] Good morning, sir. (fingers clicking) - Uh, what do you mean? - I got your place, you got to mine. Looks like you want this game to continue. - Now listen young man, nobody wants a game here. I just wanna make sure you're safe. - Young man? My are we polite today. Bet you got all your buddies listening in too. You wouldn't want them to know what an uber jerk you are. Fat one listening too? - Oh yeah, you got the whole gang. - Listen son, this is Captain Bernasky. - Shut up pops, I don't care if you're Captain Kangaroo. This game is between Norm and me and he's the only one I wanna talk to. - Alright, alright kid. What do you want? - You know what I want Norm. '95. - Why? Why do you wanna know about that? - 'Cause you don't wanna tell me. - [Cop] No good, he's on a cell phone. - Alright kid, I'll tell you about '95 and then you tell me where you are, okay? - Deal. - Is that a promise? - Got my word. - Okay. '95 I made a terrible mistake. - That's it? - Hey, you never said how specific I had to be. Now it's your turn. - Man, you got me hook, line and sinker on that one. Guess a deal's a deal, right? Hang on. Trish, what's the address here? - What did you just say? - [Trish] 48 Ram Street. - [Nathan] Did you get that, dimples? That's right Norm, Trish told me everything. Well, almost everything. - I am gonna get you kid. - Not here you won't. I'll be long gone by the time you get here. But I will meet you at a place called Laserland in one hour. You come alone. Any sign of your pals and you'll never see me again. - You can go in there alone, but I'm gonna have the exists covered. I don't want this kid getting away again. (rhythmic music) - [Man] Attention please, Lou Ser, Detective Lou Ser. Please come to the front desk. - [Child] Let's go! - Excuse me, you just paged me. - Are you Lou Ser? - Yeah, apparently. Hi kid? Kid I'm here, now where are you? - [Nathan] That's for me to know and you to find out but here's a hint. These walkie talkies only have a range of about 20 yards. Cold, you're very cold. Warmer. - Excuse me, where did you get that? I've been looking all over for that. - Lady, do you mind? This is police business. Alright, come on kid. - [Nathan] Warmer, warmer. - Hey excuse me sir, you need a gun to go in there. - How's this for a gun? Alright kid, where are you? Talk to me. (intriguing music) Come on, where are you? Come on kid, you're shy all of a sudden? (Nathan grunting) - Norm, he's got me! - Police! (guns blasting) (thug grunting) (intense music) - Go on kid, you get out of here now! Go on, get out! (intense music) Freeze. Put the gun up in the air. Easy, easy. That's it. Game's over. - You okay, Norm? - Yeah I'm fine, I'm fine. That joker may not be feeling too good about it now. Did you find the kid? - No, we didn't find him. - Well we better before Benoit finds him first. (foreboding music) (Nathan breathing heavily) (soothing flute music) - That was really good Kristen, really good. Let's try it again but this time pick up the tempo a little, okay? - Okay. - Okay. (soothing flute music) I'll be back in a minute, Kristen. You keep playing, okay? I don't know what to say? - Hi would be nice. - Hi. - Hi. - It's been a while. - Three years, four months, 14 days. I don't know how many minutes 'cause you know, I never was a real expert on time. - I don't know, you seem to be an expert on closing time. - Ah. - I'm sorry, that was a cheap shot. - I'm sure I deserved it. - You look good. How are you doing? - I have my days, you know how it is. And what's new with you? - I'm not seeing anybody if that's what you mean. - Oh no, I didn't... I mean I'm here on police business. - Oh, why don't you just give me a minute here, okay? - So you can't tell me anything else about him? Likes, dislikes, hobbies? - You mean other than his insatiable curiosity about you? No. - Yeah, don't I know all about that? Look, you didn't tell him about... - What do you think, Norm? I have to tell you though, he certainly did con me. Devious little fella, isn't he? - Devious? Trish, this kid is diabolical. - It seems to me that little Norman has gotten under your skin. - Right, like a tick. - Oh, I don't know Norm, I think he looks good on you. - Oh please, spare me the character evaluations. Remember, your attorney took care of that last time. - Yeah. - I just to figure out where he might go and I don't know anything about kids, Trish. Maybe you can help me out here? - Well believe it or not Norm, you were once a kid yourself. Where would you go when you got scared? - Me? Are you kidding me? I was a chicken. Anything spooked me I was just, I headed straight home. - Well? (soft, relaxing music) - Those flowers look pretty. - Oh, thanks. - Well thank you on behalf of the entire police department. (Trish chuckling) Look (clears throat) I was thinking. You know-- - I'd love to. Where and when? - Friday, my place, seven o'clock. - Great. - I'll cook you dinner. - Oh well this I can't wait to see. (both laughing) - White? White, you got the kid's home address? - Sorry Norm, still nothing. - Come on, I got you his initials. That didn't help? - You know how many eight to 11 year old boys in this city have the initials NT? I need more than that, Norm. I'm a genius, not a psychic. - Genius, genius, wait a minute. Genius. Can you access school records with that thing? - I can do almost anything. - What if you cross referenced what you got with gifted children? You know, kids with IQ's of 140 and up? - It's worth a try. - Good, let's try it. (Norm snoring) (phone ringing) Yeah. - [Dwight] Norm, it's Dwight. I think I've got something. - Yeah. - Mother's inside. She thought the kid was at camp. He even called every day to check in. Kid's pretty good. - Yeah, tell me about it. Hi, I'm Detective Gannon. - Oh, you're the one who was taking care of Nathan. - I'm afraid it was more like the other way around. - He can be quite a handful, can't he? Please come on in. He's had it pretty rough lately. I missed some mortgage payments and they put me on notice, so I had to take on a second job. I suppose he told you about his father? - No, no. - He passed away last year. Car accident. - I'm sorry. - Well it's not like it was totally unexpected. See, Larry had a drinking problem. - How did Nathan get along with his father? - Nathan's very hard on him. He used to drive Larry crazy. He thought that Nathan must have hated him; but in hindsight, I don't think he did. I like to think that maybe he just loved him so much he was challenging him to be a better person. I suppose that's just wishful thinking on my part though. - You never know. - But Larry wasn't a bad man. He had a lot of great friends. In fact, I just got a letter from one saying how wonderful he was and that he'd loaned him all this money when he was down and out and inside this letter was $10,000. I mean I never even knew Larry had seen that kind of money, let alone lend it out to someone. Anyway, I can't tell you how much we needed that money. - It didn't happen to come in hundreds, did it? - Yeah, I think it did. How did you know? - Oh, it's an old Irish custom. (intriguing music) (phone ringing) - Play dumb, you don't know anything. - Hello? Nathan, hi sweetheart. How are things? Uh huh, well that's good. I miss you. Whatcha been up to? - What are you doing here? - I'm working. - What? Oh no, I understand. It's for you. - [Norm] Hi kid. - You just won't give up will you, Norm? - No, I won't, Nathan. Now listen, kid I know about everything. How tough it's been on you and about your dad. - So now you're gonna throw it my face? - That's not what I meant. - Fine, make it even then. Tell me about you, Norm. Tell me about '95. - Look kid, I don't have time for this. Now you know what these people will do if they catch you. You gotta let me protect you. - Yeah and you do a real good job of that too, Norm. - Alright, forget about me. You've got the entire police department this time protecting you. - Norm, has it ever occurred to you that you guys are the only ones who knew I was at Laserland? Thanks but I'll take my chances out here. (foreboding music) - Do you know what time it is? Jeez Norm, you gotta switch to decaf. - Yeah. - What's with the personnel files? - I think somebody around here has been moonlighting. - No kidding. - My homework. - Uh oh look out, bathroom bandit's back. (cops laughing) Norm, would it be just you or is your squad joining you today? (laughs) (soft pop music) (rhythmic music) - [Reporter] Police are still searching for a 12 year old-- - Alright, son. - The young man, believed to have been witness to the murder of Richard Richie Marvin, an 18 year old street person. - Whoa big spender. I gotta see if I can break this, hang on. - [Reporter] Is urged to contact the police. Call the studio for updates on your local 410 (mumbles). (toilet flushing) (Norm whistling) - [Man] Hey! - Sorry, sorry. (foreboding music) (car horn blaring) - Gannon, I got a favor to ask. Next time you get a hot tip, keep it to yourself. - I don't get this. Why would the kid drag me all the way down here and then not show up. - To make you look like a fool, that's why. - Succeeded big time too. - No, look, I know this kid. If that was his plan, he'd have greased the floor. He'd have put glue on the door handles. Even try to blow me up, something. I am telling you, we're missing something here. - Yeah, I'm missing lunch. Come on, let's go. - Yeah. (car horn honking) - Let me talk to Benoit right away. Of course this is a safe line. Look, I just had a visit from the cops. Somehow or other they've connected me with the kid. I don't know, you tell me. All I know is this was never part of the deal. We gotta shut down. I'll clean up here, you take care of Hudson Printing. Fine, just be out of there by tomorrow night. In the meantime, I'd wear your cop another five grand. I want that kid taken care of. Hey, you dropped your bag. - Thanks. (rhythmic music) - Tina, got a minute? - What is it? - What do you think of Murdoch? - Without using profanity? You think it's him? - Put the sting on Benoit in '92. He spent six months watching every little thing that crook did. What do you think he came up with? - What? - Nothing. - Pretty tenuous, Norm. Okay, let me ask around. - Thanks. - Hey, Dwight. - Hey Norm, I checked out Madison Mercatile on the computers like you asked me to. Seems you were right. Benoit had a whole truckload of accounts there through numbered companies with major dollars going in and out. - That smells like money laundering and our kid's stuck right in the middle. - I'll keep at it but most of the staff's gone by seven. - Thanks. (car horn blaring) Oh Trish, I'm sorry. - Don't be. It gave me a chance to relive the good old days. (Norm sighing) - Wow Norm, impressive. Finally got a housekeeper. - Yeah, sort of. Well I could use a drink. How about you? - Sure. Whaddya got? - Well I've got Diet Coke and Snapple. (Trish laughing) - Snapple, great. You know I remember the first time you cooked for me. I thought I'd found the perfect guy who's cute and could cook. Except that time I think it was Special K, remember? No, of course you don't remember 'cause you would have to be listening to me to remember. Wouldn't you, Norm? - Hmm? Yeah. - What's the matter? - Nothing. Nothing, why? - Let's just say I recognize the look. - No, I'm fine really. - I gotta go. - Trish, I... I'm sorry. (sighs) I'm afraid. I'm worried about the kid. I'm worried that he's getting in to something he may never be able to out of. I can't handle the blood of somebody else on my hands. (sighs) Not again. I don't know how to reach him. If I could just grab him and shake him. - Well maybe that's not the way to him, Norm. Maybe I don't know what the heck I'm talking about but it seems to me this you versus him thing just isn't working. You gotta show him that you're on his side. - Yeah but he won't listen to me. - Maybe he will if you tell him what he wants to hear. (Norm sighing) - Come on, what difference is that gonna make? - It would have made all the difference for us. Norm, it's not about shutting people out. It's about letting them in. (foreboding music) - So, you wanted to see me? - Nobody knows you're here, right? - Nope. - I wanna make a deal. - What's with you? - I think the better question is what's up with you, Murdoch? - What are you talkin' about? - Your top drawer. I understand that's where you keep Benoit's little present? - Are you crazy? Have you been hitting the sauce? Because you're not making any sense. - Open it up. - Get out of here. - I said open it up. In one minute, open it up. What do we got here? - What's going on here? - He's working with Benoit. - Mur? - I swear I don't how that got in my drawer. What are you up to? - You're under arrest Jabba. - Hey look, I don't have to take this. - Maybe I'm not as dumb as I look, huh. Or maybe you just are. (intriguing music) - Norm, you need to take a break. - You know what? You have been such a great friend that I would be more than willing to share this bust with you if you would do this. - (chuckles) Nice try. Seriously Norm, this was your hunch and you played it out. You earned this one. (phone ringing) - Yeah, Gannon here. - [Nathan] It's me. - Look kid, you had all of us worried sick. But listen, you can come in now. You were right about the inside man but we found him. - Yeah Norm, I really believe you. - Hey I wasn't the one who said be at Madison Mercantile and didn't show. - You mean that place were you showed up and busted in with six cops and made a total freak of yourself? I was there Norm, you just didn't look hard enough. - I don't buy that. You know what I think? I think you wanted me to go charging in there just like I did. I think you never had any intention of hiding in that place in the first place. - Norm, ease up on the thinky stuff. Your brain was never equipped for heavy machinery. - I think you wanted me to rattle somebody's cage. Somebody you were scared of. - [Nathan] Excuse me? - Problem is you couldn't stop them yourself could you? That's why you needed me. - I don't need anybody. - Oh really? Then why do you keep calling me, huh? - Fine, then I won't. I'm gone. - No, no, don't go. Look, maybe you're right; maybe you don't need me. Maybe the fact is I need you. - What are you talking about? - I don't know, maybe... I need you to let me help you so nothing bad happens again. I don't know. Look, forget it. - [Nathan] No, really, I'm listening. - Alright, this may be hard for you to believe. Hard for me to believe sometimes but I used to be considered a pretty good cop, you know? Promotions, awards, commendations. Me and my partner, Bobby, we were on the fast track. Anyway, me and my partner were dogging this heavy duty bad guy named Benoit for months without getting anywhere. I mean this guy was playing it really really clean. Then finally one day right at the end of our shift, we thought we might be getting the break we'd been waiting for. Something tells me he's not here to check out the real estate. Come on. - I don't know about this, Norm. I say we wait for back up. - What is your problem? You just get your nails done? - It's dark in there. The entry is totally unprotected. He could be anywhere. - Gone is what he's gonna be if we just sit and wait. He is in there doing something odd. I wanna catch him while he's doing it, come on. - Come on Norm, don't be an idiot. Norm! (suspenseful music) - [Norm] So Bobby and I didn't call for back up and I went into the warehouse alone. - Freeze! - Gimme the gun. Gimme the gun or I'll cut him. - Don't do it Bobby, he'll just kill us both. - You think I'm crazy? Give me the gun and I'm out the door. If not, I got no choice. Now! - Bobby did it. He gave up his gun. (gun blasting) He did it and to this day, I don't know why. He gave up his gun, but he killed Bobby with the first shot. There was nothing I could do. Me, I got away completely untouched. Bullet was meant for me and it should have been mine. - I'm at Broadview and Hudson. I'll be waiting for you. (rhythmic music) - No. Kid. - No laughing. No smirking either. Hasn't been easy you know. - Yeah, I imagine not. - I suppose you want this back too, huh? - Yeah. I'll send you the bill. So what are you doing here? - I'll show ya. Look at that. - That's Benoit. - I don't know who he is. All I know is the guy from the bank said that somebody's gonna get rid of something here. - Probably evidence of money laundering. But why here? Hell, maybe I should just call a couple of back up units. Hold the little surprise party to find out why. This time Murdoch won't be around to spoil the fun. - You mean the fat guy? - Yeah, turns out he was your inside man. You were right. Here, let me help you with that. We found an envelope with $2000 of Benoit's money stashed in his desk. - That's weird, the guy at the bank said they were giving the cop five grand. They said they were going to wire the money. Sure you got the right guy? - Of course I got the right guy. - I don't know. Maybe you've been had. - Is that what you think, really? Well you don't know what you're talking about. I mean nobody knew that Murdoch was even a suspect except for me and Tina. - Oh nice goin', Norm. - Tina, you've gotta be kidding me. - Does it look like I'm kidding? Let's go. (gasoline trickling) (intriguing music) Keep moving. - This was inevitable, wasn't it? Good for you. No, bad for you actually. Never learn will you? Last time it cost you your partner. Well this time it's gonna cost you a helluva lot more than that. - This is real, is it? - Are you kidding? It's all phony like everything else about this guy. - Actually, this is of the highest quality. Even the finest experts can't discern the difference. - Like all your stooges at Madison Mercantile who did all the laundering for you? - Distribution is the key to any successful business. Unfortunately, we will be having to close up shop here. Other presses will be open. Of course this is no longer any concern of yours, is it? - Sorry, Norm. - Yeah. Gonna leave you holding a bag Tina, you know that? Who do you think they're gonna come after when they figure out that Murdoch didn't have anything to do with this? - After you, actually. Seeing as you were the one who set him up. So after they discover you missing, they'll just chalk it up to another drunk cop gone bad. - What about the kid? - We'll deal with him later. Let's take him along for insurance. - I don't wanna die! Don't kill me, please! (weeps) - Come on kid, it's gonna be alright. - No, it's not. They're gonna kill me. They're gonna kill you too. God, don't do this. - Oh kid. - Goodbye old friends. So sorry to see you go. Ta-ta! (ominous music) - Great. Come on. - Quick investigation if you please. Get rid of the car. (intense music) - Where are ya? (glass shattering) - We'll be there in half an hour. (intriguing music) - Not this time, Benoit; not this time. (phone ringing) This better be good. - So, where are we going anyway? - Not far. - Hey, there's Riverside Park. - Oh kid, kid, kid, you are a genius. (intriguing music) (tires screeching) Police, it's an emergency. - Thank God, I thought it was a carjacking. - It is, get out. You, out. - Alright alright, I'm out. - Lady, wait, wait wait! I need you to call 911. Tell them an officer needs assistance, Riverside Park. (tires screeching) (intense chase music) - Drummond Bridge? I thought you said we weren't going far. - Drummond Bridge, blast it! - [Nathan] Hey, there's River Road. It's not that busy this time of day, is it? - Great kid, you're doing great. - You talk too much. - Do I? Sorry, I guess I'm a little nervous. See I've never been this far south before. - That's it, keep it up. - Shut up. (phone buttons beeping) - Four. Four, four what? I got four, four, four what? Pier four. (tires screeching) - What are you doing? (helicopter blades whirring) (Nathan grunting) (intense chase music) - Hold it right there! - Norm! - Hold on. - That's far enough. Give me the gun! - No way. - Give me the gun! Give me the gun right there. - No way. - You don't wanna live with this again, do you? - Alright, alright. (helicopter blades whirring) - The fallout from Tuesday's capture of counterfeiter Jean Benoit continues today as more arrests were made. All of this was due to the efforts of one person, 12 year old wonder kid, Nathan Thomas. - Well, that's enough of that, huh? You alright? (door knocking) - Yeah. - Here's your clicker. Well, speaking of the Devil. - Oh great. - Hey, Norm. - Ow! - Is that you in there, Norm? - What's left. - I think I'll give you men some privacy. - So you gonna be alright? - Alright enough to kick your butt if you skip school any more, Mr Hero. Talked to your mom yesterday. I told her I might stop by from time to time just to check up on you. But no more running away from home, okay? 'Cause if you do, you know I will come after you and I will find you. - Yeah I know, so I got you this. Come on, open it. - What is this? Detective Norm Gannon. Hide and seek champion of the world. (soft music) - Thanks. - Thanks. - I gotta go. Flying me out to New York to do the Letterman show. - Oh. - So see you later, Norm? - You bet. - See you, Norm. - See you, Nathan. - Come see us again, okay? - Yup. - Great kid. - Mm mmm. - No, not again. Kid! Hey kid, kid. Kid! Kid! - Bye Norm. (funky disco music) (soft cheerful music) (rhythmic music) (mystical music)
