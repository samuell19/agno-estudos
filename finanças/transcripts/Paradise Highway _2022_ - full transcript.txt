Vehicle in the left lane causing congestion, so... avoid this route. Thank you for the morning traffic update, John. You know, Fred, I always get this strange feeling when I'm stuck in traffic. There I am, mere feet away from other people packed together on a strip of asphalt. Yet we find ourselves passing by each other from the loneliness of our respective tin cans. You got the supply chain, right? Transportation of goods being... Your goal is to meet your high-value objectives, ensure the supplier feels good about the deal. Let's round off the hour and welcome the rising sun with a song that I'm sure you'll remember. ♪ I got my looks from my mama and dad ♪ How is your morning, drivers? All good in Albany, ladies, headin' south. Well, I pulled an all-nighter out here, unloading in Sacramento. Mornin' over there yet? No, it's all dark here. Can't wait to head back East as soon as I get her emptied out and loaded back up. Well, I got a great view up in the Rockies, but the truth is I'm just scared shitless of the trip down. Break on the engine, sweetie. Jake break, driver. How about you, Sally? Hey, chiquita, you still there? Yeah, still here. I got a beautiful day here. Heading east to 61. Good to have you back, chica. Oh, shut up, Pattie. She's Canadian, not Mexican. She talks weird. That's all I know. Okay, you're giving me shit, you motherfuckers. Oh, yeah. You got it. You pickin' up your brother today? No, Thursday. Come on, Dolly. She ain't been talking about anything else for weeks. Do he talk weird like you, Sally? Well, Dolly, fuck you very much. Shut it. You know he came down here when he was real little. Sally came later. Yeah, right. That's what fucked her up. No, that's what fucked him up. Fuck you, too. Okay, drivers. Gotta go. Bye now. Be safe. Safe. - Safe. - Safe. - Yeah? - I'm here to visit. Thank you. I missed you so much. Take your seats, please. I have not been this excited to see you since you came down from Quebec with Mom. Pick you up Thursday? You better. You got the "dress-out" in the mail, right? Yeah. It's just so weird because, uh... you know, you cope while you're in here and... and when it's almost over, then you just can't take it anymore. It's kinda like when you have to go to the bathroom... You're almost there, and the door is locked. Sit back, please. It's her. Well, I know what I want. I want you to make me that... tart tartu. I want you to make a tart tartu. What was it? What was it? What's that stuff Mom made? - Tarte Tatin. - Tarte Tatin. - Apple tart. - I love it. Two minutes. Thursday. What? Please, you said that was the last time. They asked for one more. I know, I know, I know. I gotta get on the outside. You gotta get me on the outside. Okay? Just one more time. - So, last package, I promise. - Okay. All right? We ain't bad. We ain't bad. Listen, listen, listen. All visitors must exit now. They're gonna fucking kill me. Sis, you gotta get me - out of here, okay? - Okay, yeah, yeah. Where's the package? What the fuck? You'll take her there. Across the state line. Paul's the guy who's gonna meet you. Come on, sweetie. Yep. No way. No fucking way. - Excuse me? - You don't understand. I don't take people. Hey! I was told I could trust you. No way I can promise what'll happen to your brother if you don't take the girl where she fucking needs to go! What's your name? We're not gonna talk. Paul? Yep. Come on, lady. It's paid fo... No! Get off of me! Fuck! Fuck! Get down! Fuck! Shut up! Northbound... can I get a radio check? Any bears at the weigh station? Any bears at the weigh... The fucking fuse! - Get down! Get down! - No! They can search the entire truck. Get down! No! Stop! Police! Police! Is that what you want? All right, kids, run to the bathroom. We gotta get you in the back. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stop! - No! No! - Come on! Shh. - Let's go, guys. - Come on. Hurry... You're gonna miss Nia's birthday. - Mornin'. - Mornin'. - In, in, in, in. - Quick, quick. Seatbelts. - Dennis? - I'm sorry. Took some time to get a burner phone. You okay? - It was a girl, Dennis. - What do you mean? Young. Ten, 12 maybe. Wait, what, what? What are you talking about? The fucking package was a girl. What? Oh, fuck. What did you do? She shot the guy. With your shotgun. Oh, my God. Is he dead? I don't know. I think so. I... Oh, we're so fucked. What are we gonna do? - What-what are you hauling? - Unloading in Oxford. Got another taking me to Jackson. That's it. Okay, all right, you just listen. Just seem... Just seem regular, you know. Just finish whatever bookings you got. Are you gonna be okay? You're in danger, sis. These guys have eyes all over the fucking state. And the girl... where do I drop the girl? I don't know, I don't know. You just gotta take her... take her with you. - What? - I-I don't know. No! No way she can stay in my truck. She's the only thing keepin' us safe. Hey, beautiful. Fuck off! Motherfucker! He just... He exploded. This is your guy, right? Fuck. Yeah, I took him down a half year ago when we busted the MacDougal traffic ring. Low level sergeant, oversaw one of the routes. - He's out already? - Out on bond. Pictures of those girls still haunt the web. Shell casings? Prints? Fingerprints only from the victim. They ended him with a slug. - Nasty choice for a hit job. - Hmm. Other slug's in that tree over there. And you're retired for how long now? Consultant Gerick at your service. So, who's your new assistant? Ah, desk rat from legal. Wants field experience. Went to Yale. I heard they have a very good English department. Mm. Strange. Paul came here to pick up a girl who'd been transported across the state line. His normal routine. But then... Why? It's what we're trying to figure out. We got wider and deeper tracks from the second vehicle. It's probably a truck. Yeah. Refrigerated trailer or dry van. No tarp. All right, well, start by alerting the weigh stations, Finley. Excuse me, Gerick. Just, please, call me by my last name. - All right, Yale. - Sterling. You gonna make those calls or you gonna write a poem about it? I'll make the calls. Just, please, call me Sterling. Yeah. Never seen you so lazy, Ms. Sally. Sorry, Frank, got a bad knee. You got a lover in there, huh? Always. Uh-huh. Well, you ready to roll. Take these out to the car. Whoa. - Come on, come on. - Fine. All right. Hey, so, State Police are doing us a favor on the weigh stations, and we got a match on the muddy tire tracks headed onto the south highway entrance. So Mississippi, not Tennessee. - And... - Here. Yeah, Gerick, I'm not your assistant. This is my case, and I appreciate having you on as a consultant, but right now, we just need you to sign this, and then... We start with files from last year. I'll bet he was whacked by one of his little buddies. We take a look at all known associates. Find out which one might've had a beef with Paul. And we're looking for a girl. One. He always bought 'em one at a time. Yeah, so we just need you to sign this report for headquarters. No time for bureaucracy, Yale. I think you're taking this a bit too personally, sir. - Excuse me? - I think you heard me. All right. We're taking my car. And let me know where we're at with that cell phone. Okay, so we did crack Paul's phone. It wasn't easy. With recent numbers already being dead, we couldn't trace it, and no registered address. But he did pay for the phone bill with a credit card that also paid the utilities at an address. Good lung capacity there, Yale. What is that, Ivy League swim team? I put in a request for a warrant. - Ah, we're not waiting for that. - Gerick. Something's not right. Paul should've called by now. Go back to your room! Be smart. Stay in the back. Don't let anybody see you, okay? Hey! Hey, you! Hey! Who's that girl? - What the fuck are you doing? - Goddamnit! Does anyone care that I am working next door? All right. Okay. Let's get goin'. I always move the truck after being seen outside of this truck stop. Worst reputation on the road. Hmm. My brother. He's good. Champ. He'll help. You got a brother? Sisters? Guess you don't have no mom or dad either, huh? What are you? Baby Jesus? What's your name? Leila. Leila. And that was the farmer who found the body - on a muddy back road off 25. - Mm-hm. I see it. - Less than a mile north of the state border. - Yeah. A brutal killing that's hard to grapple with. - How did it happen and why? - That little girl's gonna tell on us. No one's gonna tell on nobody. The once quiet community is coming to terms with what's happened as the motive remains unclear in the Mud Murder. What would warrant such a violent end to a person's life? Law enforcement is questioning - the use of slugs... - Fuck me. Who leaked? - a particularly damaging bullet. - Not me. It's a most unusual find at the crime scene. Some lonesome cowboy wanting his 15 minutes of fame. Police are looking into the manner. And this, for now, is all we know about the innocent victim. Innocent, my ass. As the investigation proceeds, no stone will be left unturned. You can go to the police, tell 'em what he would've done to you. That it was self-defense. Hmm? Is where the crime took place, spreading fear on what... Just don't bite and kick 'em, all right? Still hiding in the woods. It's not yet confirmed... I don't like the police. But it is confirmed that the manhunt covers both states. You crying 'cause you're scared, or you crying 'cause that piece of shit is dead? You know, Leila, you might have shot him, but I left him there to die. We're in this together. Oh, we can't cross state lines. It's too risky with the weigh stations. Mm-mm. I'll get us to a place where we can't be found. We'll wait there till my brother has a plan. Yes, Patterson, yes. I know, I know. You have to see the girl in order for me to get the warrant, even if I need the warrant to get the fucking girl! You know, we might still be able to get it. I'm afraid the idiots at legal disagree with you, Yale. All right, well, I used to work there, so... I know that. You're the idiot who refused to issue the warrant that would've kept Paul from getting out on bond! Okay. My buddy caught a glimpse of a young girl poking her head out of a blue Peterbilt yesterday. Said the truck was headed south on 49. Called some of our friends down there to be on the lookout. Can't hate 'em much. Give me extra time off when I got my daughter. 'Cause we all know 34 hours ain't much. Yeah, I just sleep and fuck through 'em. Hey, Sally. Headin' to Louisville anytime soon? Nope, not any time soon. Yeah, can't go far from Utica. - That's right. - No shame in that. I only ran local 'round New York when my beau was at Sing Sing. - It's her brother, Dolly. - Beau, brother. Only difference is one's gonna cheat on ya and not the other. - Very funny. - Come on, Sal. What's going on with the two-syllable responses? Uh, sorry, Pattie, been having a rough time. Wanna tell us about it? I got 500 miles of windshield time and nothin' to do. It's okay to ask for help, Sally, we're just a phone call away. Maybe later. All right, ladies, drive safe. - Safe. - Safe. Safe. Florida is a dump. I don't care if it's a dump when you can go wherever you want. Where do you wanna go? Walmart? No. The ocean. Oh. 'Cause the ocean goes everywhere. Hey, stop that! Stop that! - That's dangerous. It's dangerous. Who the fuck cares? It feels good. The neighbor said she saw girls walking in and out of the house. "Maybe should've called someone," she says, but doesn't wanna get involved. - Hm. - I can't believe people are like this. Well, write a poem about it. Isn't that what you do at Yale? No. Sometimes we write essays. Well, get her statement. On it. Ma'am! One second. All right, Patterson. We got what you need. I'm worried about you, sis. You should find a place to hide. One of the... One of those big truck stops. - I know a place we can hide. - Okay, good. You don't think you've been spotted yet, right? - No. - Good. Good. - No. - All right. All right. So-so, you'll hide overnight and then you make your way to Arkansas tomorrow. - Arkansas? - You'll be safer there. But I'm pickin' you up in Utica tomorrow. No, you can't do that. Not with the load you're carrying. But I wanna be there when you get out. I know, I know. That was the plan, but it's not safe, sis. These guys aren't fucking around. Okay. Okay, so what do I do? Get across the border and meet you? Where? At home. - Home? - Mm-hmm. I'm not going back home, Dennis. I haven't been there since I was 15, I... I can't go back. Dad's dead. I know, I paid for his fucking casket. - I'm not going. - It's the only safe place I know, I'm sorry. Shit, someone... Someone's coming. I-I gotta go. We found a dog in the basement. We need a few minutes to tranquilize it. Okay. Saunders? Neighbors say they saw the girls walking around the neighborhood. I don't understand. Why didn't they... call the police? Ask for help? Something. These kids have been fucked over by the system since the day they were born. They don't call the police. Nobody gives a shit and they know it. They also know that if they step out of line what happens. That's what the basement is for. - A kid had been in this cage. - What? A kid had been in this cage. Bolted to the wall. Dog was running loose. From the looks of the dog, it had been trained to be aggressive. Traces of blood on the bolts. Looks like someone tried to claw their way out. Fresh. Couple of days. We just missed them. Clothes in the cage. Pant size, dress size. She's probably about five feet. Young. And she found a pencil to doodle with. You know this place? This truck stop's so big... even the pimps don't know their way around. We can hide here till tomorrow. Okay. Let's go over the ground rules. Hair spray, AKA pepper spray. Here. Man's coat stays on the driver's seat. Makes them think a guy lives here. At night, curtains closed, lights off. Lights on is an invitation. Right? Someone knocks, we don't open. Doors locked. Windows up. Seatbelt wrapped through the door handle and fastened when we're sleepin'. You sleep up top. I'm on the bottom. Got it? - Got it. - I do the shoppin'. But you do the dishes. You stay here. Don't let nobody see you, okay? - All right. - That's it. But I need to go to the store. Uh, didn't you hear what I said? Your underwear is huge on me. Would you prefer me to walk around with 'em gathered in my ass? This it? It's for my niece. Well, how do you like that? I see you more than I see my own family, and I didn't even know you had a niece. Oh, come on, Patterson, don't give me this shit about priority of resources, man. This is a fucking priority. Fuck! Fuck! - Yeah. - Fuck! You've been at this, what, 30, 40 years? Fifty. Still gets you riled up, huh? How the hell can it not? Why don't they run? You know? Because I would. Anything to get away from that hellhole. Fuck no. You... You'd be locked in a basement. No, you wouldn't run. You'd stay. Try to play the game. Survive. What the fuck would you live on out there? Grass? Clover? Best case scenario, you're found and brought right back into the system. Then you'd run again. Sorry. Most of these kids are held captive just a few miles from where they grew up. In their minds they got nowhere to go. And for a lot of 'em, that's true. Same hair as in the basement. Thank you. Shouldn't we get... Shouldn't we get rid of that? Not an option. My mom gave it to my brother before she died. They find this... they've found us anyway. You fire it, you clean it. I see his eyes all the time. You kill someone 'cause you wanna be free, but then he still gets you. How'd you learn to shoot? This guy Cooper. My mom left me with him when she went to work. He was buildin' an armory. He always said if the world went to shit... he'd be ready. Do you ever feel lonely? Always. Just a few gallons of gas. - Oh, you want gas? - Please, lady. Well, bring your car! I'll give you some gas. I just want a few dollars. It'd be better so I can buy... Oh, now you want money! Ask for money! We're all struggling here! I just wanna take my kids to the... You got kids? Go take care of them. - See? - Yeah, I see. God... And what do you want me to do? - Well... - Resources are so fucking scarce, they're telling us to prioritize only infants and toddlers. Patterson, we can catch these fucking guys. It's you and Sterling, Gerick. That is it. If we don't bring 'em down now, they just set up some place else and then what? Ten more girls? Fifteen? Trafficking will not go away until people stop buying, Gerick. We know that. All right? We get these guys and someone else is just gonna satisfy the demand. It could be your daughter, Patterson. Hi. I saw you earlier today. Uh, I was just wondering if you wanted to come over. Uh, my mom's making pancakes, so I just thought... Thanks, but I don't have time. M-maybe later? We're in the pink RV over by the store. Okay, well, maybe later. Bye then. See ya. Wow. Who knew she could still shine. You said he would help. You don't read other people's letters. He's in fucking jail, so how's he gonna help us? What do you mean? "Us"? You and me are not "us". The only "us" I know is me and my brother. Why didn't you tell me he was in jail? He's getting out of jail tomorrow. 'Cause of you, I can't be there. You could've just told me. None of your fucking business. Like looking for a needle in a haystack. A semi is no needle though. It stands out pretty much anywhere. If I was them... I'd duck into someplace familiar and just lay low. And a young girl with a trucker might stand out just enough for someone to have taken notice. - Yeah. - Wait. You're not suggesting we go analog and go to every truck stop ever? - 'Cause there's... there's many. - There aren't that many. And a guy like this won't stray far from his comfort zone. You're driving. Let's go. - Hello. - Oh, shit. I was worried about you. I worked it out. We gotta get the girl back to them, and they'll let us off the hook. - Where you at? - Sherrigan's. Heading to Arkansas tomorrow like you told me. Okay. Okay. Everything good there? - Yeah. All's good. - Great. Okay. - I love you. - I love you, too. Just keep the girl close. She's our lifeline, sis. - Yeah. - Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. - Yeah. - I think we're gonna be okay. Hello. Okay. All right, we're on our way. We got 'em. Take a left. All right, all right, all right, let's see. Okay. Rock, okay. It starts with rock. And then scissors cuts paper. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. Rock, pa... Rock, paper, scissors, gun, shoot. Rock, paper, scissors, shoot. What the heck? Okay, rock, shoot. What you got there, Yale? Toothbrush? Yeah, I drink a lot of coffee. Okay. All right. It's our fourth stop today. What's gonna be different about this one? You wanted field work. This is the field. Sorry, it's not as sexy as you thought it would be. Let's see what we find. Shot of whiskey. My youngest is sick and we just need a few dollars for the bus. You have kids, right? You know what I'm goin' through. Excuse me, sir. I have... I have a sick mother at home and my car broke down. I really... I just need a few bucks. You got kids? You got kids? You got kids, don't you? - Hi, Mom. - Hey, baby. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. - Okay, now. - Thank you. - Thank you. - All right. Thank you. Do you ever feel lonely? Mm, no, not really. Mm, how about, like, when you're with people? That maybe you'll always be lonely because no one knows the world the same as you do? Uh... I haven't seen any little girl. I am so sure I would've noticed that, but I only work certain shifts. Well, what about personnel? Is there anyone here consistently who might've noticed something suspicious? Well, I think your best bet might be to go over there to the bar and talk to the bartender. He knows most everybody coming in and outta here. And the regulars, they're always around. Okay. ♪ Yeah, yeah ♪ Excuse me, ma'am. - Yeah. - Excuse me, ma'am. What can I do for you... Officer Finley Sterling? Is that a real name? Some of my friends call me Yale, if that makes things easier for you. We're just looking for a truck driver with a little girl with him. Huh? Uh, about five foot tall. Uh, dark brown hair. You seen anybody like that? Nope. Okay, thank you. Have a good night. And you. Sally. - Hey. - I'm okay. - You okay? - Good. Okay. Do you live around here? No? What's your name? Okay. Let's get you back to your truck, okay? - Yeah. - You think you can show us the way? Oh. Watch your step, hon. Had a little too much to drink tonight, huh? - Happens to the best of us, right? Which one's your truck, huh? Is it this one? All right, let's get your keys. Where's your keys, huh? - Watch her, Tesz. - Got her. - There's no one in here. - What? I'm sayin' there's no fucking girl in here. Oh, fuck. Where is she? Huh? I said, where the fuck is the girl? What a dump. There's nothing in here but crap. What? You sure? What is all this shit? - What the hell is this, huh? - Where's the girl, huh? Where the fuck is the girl? - I don't... I don't know. - Wake up, wake up. Wake up, get up. Show me where... Oh, shit! - What the fuck? - She's shot a guy before. Hey, Deborah. Get out here. What the fuck, Tesz? Shit. Hey, what's going on out there? Shut the fuck up! I'm tryin' to sleep! Come on, Sally. Get in the truck. Here. - Come on! Get in the truck! - She's got a gun. Hey, careful. I'm tired of this shit. Tryin' to sleep over here. Get the fuck outta here! You fucked up my eye, bitch. - Fuck you! - Shut the fuck... Hey! Get the car, get the car. - Straight out. - Yeah. What the fuck? Is that her truck? - What the fuck? - Is she gonna fucking hit us? Keep her there. Hold her. Again. - We need to talk to her. - Her? It's a blue cab truck. Keep it in sight. - You get the plates? - Yeah. - All right. - No! - Wait. What the fuck are you doing? - She's getting away! We don't wanna get into a fucking car chase with the police! Calm down, all right? I don't want you to hurt yourself. Pull right. Straighten out! Fuck! In other news, the police are still on the lookout for a light blue Peterbilt truck after the incident at Sherrigan's truck stop last night. License plate F-three-one... Hmm. - We should get going. - Oh, no. Right. Can we go to this place? It's not far from here. I just wanna pick up my jacket. There ain't nobody there. So... no one's gonna see us. How the hell can they be lost, man? They're in a blue rig. Kinda hard to miss. All the roads around here aren't even on the map, sir. Well, get a chopper in the air, man, for fuck's sake. You think we got a chopper around here? Get a news chopper, I don't care! Weather chopper! - What? - She's ready to talk. You know, sometimes people help you more if you're not an asshole. - I'm only an asshole to you. - You're an asshole to everyone. And you. I don't work for nobody, sir. Some woman asked if we wanted some cash. I don't know the bitch. Don't know the trucker lady. And don't know the girl who took a swing at me. The girl took a swing at you? Yeah. She was the one holding the gun, too. You'll like our trailer. It's nice. Our trailer is bright blue, so you'll know it when you see it. My mom painted it. Your friend Cooper's place? Yeah. That was his place. Our trailer... our trailer's right behind the pink flamingo, so you'll see it in just a second. It was just prescriptions at first. She only took what the fucking doctor told her to take. I didn't wanna stay at another group home. So I ran. My mom loved me. But that stuff made her happy every time. You know, I've never actually been to the ocean before. Well, you're lucky to know where you wanna go. I only know what I'm running from. You out? Yeah. Finally. You're at the house? Yeah. Yeah, I'm home. I thought you'd be here already. I'm so nervous, Sal, about the girl, you know. We gotta get her to them tonight. They're gonna let me know what time. You promise me you'll get her home. Oh, shit... They're-they're calling me again. Sal, I... Dad used to beat us, and Dennis took the brunt of it for as long as he could to protect me. And it... it hurt him. It carved a piece out of him. It's my turn to take care of him this time. Joining conference now. Welcome, Sally. Didn't think you'd make it on here today. How was it pickin' up your brother? Hey, ladies. I got a favor to ask you. No way! Did he fuck up already? It's not for my brother. It's for me. The truck's been sighted! Positive match on the plates! Step out of the vehicle, ma'am. This a vehicle inspection, sir? Please step out, ma'am. All right. CDL, please. Follow me. Give me a moment, will ya? All right if I call you Sally? We're looking for a young girl. Dark hair. Thought you might've seen her. You and your partner asked around the bar at Sherrigan's last night. I haven't seen her, sir. What happened to your face? Didn't I tell you I was at the bar last night? Oh. And it looks like your truck took a beating for ya. Was she there, too? You know it, sir. She and me, we're one. Where are you from? Nowhere, and everywhere. That's America for you. But you've been here a long time. Where do you live? Right here, sir, in my truck. I hear ya. My car often becomes my bed. I don't mind. Solitude is nice. Well, sorry to bother you. Have a nice ride. Oh, um... Where you headed? Across the river. - Arkansas? - Arkansas. I figured. Look, Sally... there are some bad people out, wantin' to hurt that girl. The police are looking for a killer. That's not what I'm after. I just want to help her and whoever's trying to be good to her. You understand? Here. This is my number. I don't trust the system any more than you do, but some of us are not all bad. Okay? All right. Well, have a nice ride. Yeah. You wanna tell me what you're not telling them? She's with the girl all right. But that lady trucker's not who we're looking for. I think the girl was safe here with her. Last thing we need is a bunch of cops running after them with guns drawn. Oh, we'll keep an eye on her. Let her guide us to whoever she's running away from. See, people are more helpful if you're not an asshole. Yeah, all right. I have a call in at Utica. - Utica? - Her brother. Petty crimes mostly, worse up through the years. He was transporting duffels and got caught. Five years incarcerated at Utica. Same place Paul McKinney did time. That's too much of a coincidence. Her brother incarcerated in the same place as... What do they call him? Oh, the Mud Victim. Ah. See, that's poetry, Yale. Motherfucker. This will do. We won't get far with her if she feels threatened. - Oh, hi. - Hey. How you doin'? Here you go, ma'am. All right. Let's get going. Thanks, Rose. You okay, Sally? Fine. You sold your trailer? I'm gonna stay in the area, Sal. Dolly's passin' by, too. Just so you know in case you need anythin'. Where? He's out already? What? I'll call you back.

Doesn't know shit about her. He got out of the sick ward a week ago. Taking a beating. Fuck. Fucking prisons. We lock 'em up, and we're just creating a breeding ground. It's a long straight ball to center field! Home run! Oh, come here. Hey. What'd they do to you? Hey. Can't you smile anymore? Oh. Oh, wow. She is... she is really young. When do we go meet 'em? Well, they told me bring her out to the airfield about eleven o'clock. Here, here. Why don't you have a seat right there? Remember that? I'm sorry I can't get you anything. You know, nobody's been here for the past couple of years since... since our dad died. That's fine. That. Don't you touch that. Get your paws off my trophy. You know, I was... I was... I was happy when you got away. - I was. - I know. I didn't have to... I didn't have to think about... listening to something happen to you every night. It's not as bad as I thought. I mean, the mess is as bad as I thought it'd be, but... It doesn't scare me anymore. Well, that's good to hear. Should we, uh... should we get going? Sure. Where? You're right about me, you know. What? I know nothing about this. Grew up with a silver spoon. Completely disconnected. And the strongest memory I have of my mom was her picture hanging above my crib. And I joined the bureau so I could mean something to someone. Can't say that's working out. Why'd you join? Doesn't matter why I joined. Only matters what I do with it. Yeah. What? Yeah, okay. Yeah. Hospital has Sally on file. Over 30 years ago. Numerous ER visits, various, um... accidents. She was brought in by her brother. There's a home address. Uh... I don't wanna give her back. I wanna buy her out. The girl? Leila, yeah. Well, what are you gonna do with her? Where are you gonna get the money? I have some money. How much? How'd you get it? Enough. I should have some left over, too. - Mm-hmm. - How did you get it? How'd you get the money, Sal? Sold my trailer. She needs us. The way we needed each other. You mean like a... Like a family or something? Well... Well, that would take me just a little bit of time to get used to. You know? Yeah. All right. We do this, you gotta let me take care of it, all right? I'm gonna bring 'em the cash. Pay. Done. All right. Okay. Where's the bathroom? We're-we're gonna take a little ride. Uh... No. No. Leila stays with me. No, that's not how it works, sis. I gotta bring her. You-you could've taken her to the police for all they know. All right. I'll go then. No, Sal. Sal. If she's going, I'm going. Uh, Leila, let's go. - Sal. - I still have to pee. It's-it's just right here. - Useless... - I'll turn the truck around. It's just a bad idea. Get out of your pajamas. It's time to go. Joining conference now. Sally's here. Hi, Sally. Dolly's here with us. That's right, Rose. Pattie's here, too. She's slow as a little turtle, just like you, Sally. Come on, baby doll, get with it. - I'm just sayin'. - Shut up, Dolly. Sally's got some serious business to take care of. Where are you headed? Remember that old airport? Southeast? Hell yeah, I remember that place. Yeah, me too, I was gonna be a flight attendant before I broke my teeth. Just wanna tell ya, it's good to know you ladies are out there. We're always out here. Come rain or come shine. Dennis? Leila? Let's go! You look fucked up. Huh? Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah. Freezing out there. Well, Leila found something. I think you're gonna like it. Sal, what are you doin'? What are you doin'? It's-it's-it's-it's the dress that dad bought you for your 13th birthday. I thought you'd like it. - I thought you'd like it, Sal. - Take it off. Take it off, Leila. Sal... I-I thought you'd think it was cute. I thought you'd like it. I... - I don't! - All right, all right, - I fucked up. I'm sorry! - Take it off! It's clear. Hair. They were here. We missed 'em. Shit, shit, shit, shit. Shit! I'll go. Where's the girl? I wanna buy her out. That wasn't the deal. I'll pay more than the going rate. Let me see her. No. - Come on. - Dennis! I have the cash. But I need to know we're cut clean. My brother, me, the girl. And we don't see you anymore. Sure. You bought it, you own it. Really? You think I'm just gonna let you take the girl? How do I know you won't talk? 'Cause I'm just as guilty as everybody else. - That's it, just get the girl and let's get out of here! Don't hurt my sister! I said, don't hurt my sister! - Back here! - Hey. Get the girl and let's go! Hey! - Hey! - Fuck! Hey! Easy. - Den... - Hey! Get off her! - Get off her! Hey! - Fuck you! - Hey, go easy! - Get him! Dennis, what? I said... I told him not to hurt my sister. You said to make it look real! Not that real! I said don't hurt my sister! You didn't have to kill him! Why couldn't you just get the fucking kid, Claire? Huh? I told you exactly where she was! - Now get in the van! - Let go! - Dennis? - Let go of me! You-you weren't supposed to see this. - No, Sal. Sal, listen, Sal... - Let go of me! - Dennis... - Let go of me! Stop it! Sal, you weren't supposed to see this. Sal. Sal, no! Let her go! Let her go! Let her go. I was just gonna do it for a bit till we got on our feet. Sal, you were not supposed to see this. Get in the fucking van, Claire! Sal... Please... Claire, get in the van. - Please. - Let me get rid of her, okay? Just let me get rid of her, and-and we get back to us, Sal, I promise. You'll see, it's gonna be fine. No, Sally! Sal, it's gonna be okay. Sally! Please! No! Dennis, stop! Stop! Don't! Leila! Leila! Leila. Leila. Sally? Come on, Sal! Come on, Sal! Fly away with me. Come fly away with me. We'll go to Mars... Saturn, and we'll go to Jupiter and China. Anywhere but here. We get the hell outta here. We're just a couple of kids. Kids... Sal? No, Dennis. They are kids. Not us. How much you sell 'em for? - No. - How much a job? - No. - How many times a day? No, you-you got it all wrong. Sal, I do it for you. I do it for you! - No! - I... Everything I do... I want you to tell me... what-what that girl does for you that I don't do. What do you owe her? She doesn't owe me anything. Sal... Hey, Sal. Let's get you in the car. Watch your head, all right? Hey. Worried about him? Never gonna stop. Well, if we can get him to help us... maybe we can catch the big guy. Promise you'll take care of those kids. Oh, don't worry. I'll see to them. That's what gets me up in the morning. Well, you... probably better get going. Local police are on their way. We have your statement, so... Have a nice ride. You know, we're gonna get in trouble for this. I'm gonna get in trouble for this. You didn't know shit about it. It's not your fault if I went rogue. You're still an asshole. To you. Seatbelt?
