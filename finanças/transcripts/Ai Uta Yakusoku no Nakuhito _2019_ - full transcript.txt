Breathing in, breathing out, nobody needs to be taught such elementary things. They repeat every day. The way we walk, the way we talk and eat become an automatism. People will die one day. When I was young, someone told me this. Ordinary things are either learned automatically or taught by someone else. To like someone, to love, is this learned automatically or taught by someone else? I certainly must not know the answer. Because I'm so eager for every day I even forget that I'm breathing. Toru! Are you having regular meals? I said I was eating properly. Is that true? Don't make such a fuss because of my meals every day. So you feel bothered if I call you. No, Mom, it's not that I feel bothered. Then, what is it? You've left home half a year ago. - Of course I wonder how you're doing. - Because I'm so eager for every day I even forget that I'm breathing. Toru, are you listening? I know, I know. Bye. Nomiya-san! The results of the recent medical examination have come. Thank you very much. I'm sorry. Sister, hurry up! Hurry up, hurry up! Sister, let's play! Let's go! One, two... Nomiya-san, it's stage 4 now. If your condition continues to deteriorate like that, your life expectancy... [ Because I'm so eager for every day ] [ I even forget that I'm breathing ] Oi! Are you serious? Really? Were really going to jump? You're too coward! Wait a moment. Who is he? That's right. Nomiya! You're Nomiya, right? Yes, you are. Tatsuya. Tatsuya! Sakamoto Tatsuya! The boy from the temple. North High, Tatsuya. Can this be true? It's been quite some time, huh? What are you doing now? Me, I'm a total NEET. (Not in Employment, Education, or Training) Playing around all day long! Don't stand there, come over here! You came just at the right moment. Come on! Come over here! I've brought a handsome guy along! What's wrong? Well, I think it's about time for us to go. Are you kidding! Nightlife has just begun. Okay, I'll present you Nomiya Toru singing. - No, no, no. - It's time for us. No, wait. We'll all sing together. All together. No, no. Let's go! Let's begin! Toru, try properly to sing! Come on, let's have fun! I'm going to die anyhow. Die? Today, the doctor told me the cancer had proliferated. If it advances fast, I've 3 months left to live. That's a joke, isn't it? You're right. Of course it's not like this, right? Actually, it is like this. So I thought we should cheer Toru up and called everyone here today. I also had no idea. So all we can do is to make you have fun. Right? Right? Right? So it is, right? Party time! - Is it true? - Sit down. I didn't... Don't make such a face! You're still alive. I guess I'll sing yet another song. Yeah, good idea! Come on, let's all join in! Sorry, we have to go home now. No, don't go yet! Bye-bye! Take care! It was fun, wasn't it? I'm going to leave too. Hey, hey, hey! Is it true that you have only 3 months left? That's short. I have to catch the last train. Wait! The last train or the remaining 3 months, which is more important? You know what? I'll help you with your wish list. Perhaps you want to do sky diving or climb a pyramid? There must be something you've always wanted to do. Let's do it and it will make you happy. I don't want any of such things. Besides, it would be pointless now. - Hand it to me. - Oi! Where is it? Look at this. The countdown applet. I've set a countdown of 3 months, so when it's down to zero, your life will be over. Don't make fun of people's life. The one who's making fun of it is you! Is this timespan so pointless? Can you just let it pass so easily? Well, until it's down to zero, do what you like to do. Just now the chance was right in front of you. A passionate love may have been waiting for you. As I said, something like that... Well, maybe she was not your type. That's not what I mean. Falling in love with someone, I've never known such a feeling. You are just afraid of getting hurt. Who isn't! A life without love is futile! Aren't I right? Hey, wait! Wait! Stop! Ladies, stop! Instead of taking the last train shouldn't we better do something different? No thanks. Come on, let's go! You see, close from here is a good shop. I can't drink anymore. But it's a good shop. Where? [ Because I'm so eager for every day ] [ I even forget that I'm breathing ] [ Breathing in, breathing out, ] [ nobody needs to be taught such elementary things. ] [ To like someone, to love, ] [ is this learned automatically or taught by someone else? ] Excuse me, that is my book. Here. I'm sorry. It's alright. Keep it. I have to catch the last train. The last train is gone. - Sorry. - You're so slow! I'm really sorry. What shall we do now? Excuse me, this... This book must be very important to you. So I'd better... Don't you think this book is important to you? When I read it for the first time, I also cried like this. Somehow it makes me happy that there's someone like me. Keep it. [ Ito Nagi Poem Collection ] [ K ] It's read Ito Nagi, right? This person. It's a 14-year-old girl. 14 years old!? You're right. It's written with so much conciseness and sensitivity. I heard she wrote these poems in a hospital bed while fighting her illness. Could it be she has passed away? About 4 years ago. I also was close to death once. When I was 18, I somehow run onto the road. It was a very painful time for me. I didn't try to commit suicide, it was just an accident. But, the visitor who gave me this book saved me. Now I'm eager for every day, be it good or bad. Actually, I've lost this book many times, but for some reason it returns each time. I guess I finally don't need it anymore. Did you hear that? No, I... I'm glad you didn’t hear it. Now I heard it. No, not 100. It's 200. Wait a moment! Shouldn't we better leave this shop? But we have ordered already. Hey, you! Have you ever been told that you look like Aikawa Hirono? You are her, aren't you? I'm sure I've seen you in a movie. What was its title again? That's it! Family Portrait! I've seen it. It made me cry! No, you're mistaking me. Of course you are. I see. It's like this now, right? You're retired, right? I said you're wrong! That startled me! Speaking of it, what's your name? I am Aikawa Hirono. But now I'm just an ordinary student. Sorry, I had no idea. Here. It's cheese. I guess we should leave the shop after we've eaten this. Huh? Amazing. That's a surprise, huh? What shall we do? It's super delicious! This is the best burrito I have ever eaten. Out of my way! Avocado Shrimp and Mexican Chili. - Delicious! - It's delicious! - Is it good? - Tasty! Then I'm glad. That's right. In Mexico, there's a favorite dish. I'll prepare it. I'll prepare it for you. Don't stand in my way! Nomiya-san, what are you reading? A book that's more effective than medicine. And it has no side effects. That's good, isn't it? Here's the check. Thank you. Thank you for your patronage. Okaasan, the same as always, okay? Hurry up and make a decision. A luncheon package... and Miso Udon please! Miso Udon, right? Okay! Here! What's that? If you make such a face, you must have quite some trouble. You came here to have a good cry and ask for help, right? You're wrong. Listen... Are you eating properly? You've lost weight, haven't you? Our body is the only thing we must not neglect. After Dad was diagnosed with cancer, it didn’t take long, right? It was painful for you, wasn't it? I wish I was more like you. That gives me the creeps! Are you really saying such things? So, what is it? You wanted to say something just now. What is it? It's nothing. - What is it? - It's nothing Excuse me! Yes! Yes, yes! Don't disappear just as you please. I didn't know how to contact you. Were you searching for a place to die? Won't you come my place? It's not very comfortable, though. What's with you? I'm worried about you. Okay, forget it. I don't need such a type at home. Sakamoto-kun! What about the band? When I heard that you became a pro, I thought Nakamoto Tatsuya was really amazing. People like us definitely couldn't do that. So you don't know? Well, it's like that. We have disbanded. We got in a fight about our 2nd album. I thougt we shouldn't just play around but do something important. In the future, we should have a serious message. That's what I wanted to create. Do you know a writer named Ito Nagi? Her death unsettled me. She was fantastic. Even shortly before her death she could find such words. I couldn't do that. When I read her poems, I recognized how empty I am. So I decided to live at least a happy life. What's that supposed to mean? Sure, I know her. Aikawa Hirono-chan. Really? Hirono-chan? It was that, right? Family Portrait. She was cute, wasn't she? Speaking of it, what are you looking at? Don't search for her photos. You have her contact adress. Contact her immediately. Such girls often have an unlucky fate. What do you mean, "unlucky fate"? She was bullied at that time. She stared in a quite popular drama and it seems the other girls were extremly jealous and always bullied her. It was reported on TV. Don’t you remember? Here. Look at this. Thereupon, she rushed out of the shooting scene and had an accident. And then, she retired. Well, I guess life gets more difficult when you grow older. I will help you with her. She's among your LINE friends, right? No, don't do that. Stop it! I'll do it myself. Well said. - Aikawa-san! - Yes. You can call it quits for today. You know that self-service shop before the station? What self-service shop? The cake shop, of course! - Thanks for your hard work. - Thanks for your hard work. - Cake? - Yes. If you have time this Friday, how about we go for a meal? Oh, young lady, you're here again? Hello. You see, we're watching Instagram. Instagram? Oh, a tea column! Something good will happen today. What is that, a tea column? Something that makes you feel very happy. Therefore, let's take a photo of the tea column. Something good will happen, don't you think? Yeah, you're right. Have you received a reply? Oi! What happened? Answer me. If you've got no reply, send it again. Toru! Friday is perfect, I don't have to work then. Excuse me! Can I test this guitar? Hello! Say, do you have a handkerchief with you? On a date, a handkerchief is a man’s weapon. I know. And you always look down to the bottom. That's absolutely no-go! It's when I'm thinking about things. In such a moment, try to look up. It will give you self-confidence. But probably it won't make a difference, right? But, just because I looked down I found her book. And, the man must arrive earlier than the girl. That's clear, isn't it? You must use the rest of your time for things like this. Don't worry. There are still 20 minutes. That's enough. And don't forget to check the content of your bag carefully. If you forget something, it's too late. Toru? Toru! Excuse me... What's with him? Is he alright? Excuse me, that guitar over there... What do you want? Sorry, seems I'm late. No, I'm too early. Well, thank you for inviting me today. No, that... - Excuse me! - Yes? The same for me please. I haven't ordered anything yet. Sorry. - Delicious, isn't it? - Yeah, delicious. Really delicious! That store last time was interesting, huh? Very much, but a bit scary. More light on the snow please! Okay. Excuse me, please step a little back! I'm very sorry! Sorry, sorry, please step back. Good evening. Good evening. Thank you very much! Wasn't that Hashino Saeko just now? Hiro-chan!? Yes. It's been so many years! Saeko-san, you must have a sharp eye if you noticed me, mustn't you? It's no wonder. I haven't met anyone so far whom I'd prefer as my partner. Remember! In Family Portrait she played Akane-chan. Oh, Akane-chan! So you are Aikawa Hirono-san. You've grown up so much. Say, don't you want to come back to this business? I think it's your calling. - Taro-chan! - Yes! - Can you take a photo of us? - That's a good idea. - Then, position yourselves over there. - It's a rare chance, so do your best. Why didn't you continue... with acting? Shouldn't you do it again? No way, no way. But, don't you like it? I can't do that. I probably couldn't stand it. Besides, I'm satisfied. Thanks to Ito Nagi, I'm eager for every day, be it good or bad. You are the same, right? Nomiya-san, will you think about it? In consideration of your current state we better switch from chemotherapy to palliative treatment. That's my opinion. Oh, Toru! I was waiting for you. Say, did you win Aikawa Hirono over? I know that you are in a bad mood. So I brought this. To make further progress with Aikawa Hirono you need this. These are musical events. If you... And what shall she do in 3 months from now? She still has a future. She still has a lot of possibilities, in contrast to me. At least tell her that you love her! Then you will have a lot of possibilities too. If a dying guy told her this, it would only bother her. Well, you're still alive, aren't you? This is rock. There's nobody who doesn't like rock. So if she likes rock... What is "being alive"! Tell me! Well, Toru, such things... Listen! In the end, you are just amusing yourself about me. It’s true, you may have taught me how it feels to love someone. But why... Why must I experience this feeling even though I'm going to die? So, why must I? Being alive... Being alive means to feel joy, I think. After all, living every day so that you forget that you're breathing, isn't that joyful? Don't say it's so easy. For someone like me who's been told that he's going to die soon... I don’t think I have to wear a wig. But my mother said I absolutely must. I guess I better put it on. I'm sorry. I thought you were here for a visit. Because you always looked so happy. It's because I am happy. Nagi-san! Is Ito Nagi-san here? Oh no. Why are you here? I've escorted my father out. I felt a little weak, so I sat down for a rest. Go back into your room Shall we use a wheelchair? I think I'm okay. Slowly, okay? - Thank you. - You're welcome. We're almost there. Where is your mother? Did she leave with your father? She said when she came next time, she'd bring newly bought clothes for me. Very soon it will be spring, won't it? Then, I'll lower the bed. Okay. Nomiya-san. Yes. Hand it to me. Thank you. Oh no, the windows are all open. I forgot to close them. Are you taking a break from school? I've never been to school. That's alright. I don't like studying anyway. Isn't that the problem of the coins and the balance? Right. Do you know it? You weigh the coins several times with a balance to find the fake one. It's a famous math problem. Have you ever done it? In college class, they let us do it for fun. That brings back memories. With 9 coins it's quickly solved, but with 13 it's a bit difficult. I don’t understand this here at all. I've been thinking about it since a long time. Don't you actually like it... studying? Well, as a kind of puzzle. My father teaches math at the university. I guess it's his influence. But at school, you have friends... Nagi-chan! I can take this vase, right? That's okay. There are many people who can't go to school for some reason. It's not that I'm something special. But are you happy with that? Nomiya-san! Why? Well, is there anything else you want to do? Something that people who've been discharged from hospital can't do anymore, right? That! This? Isn't that what you mean? Well, I don't know myself. To like someone, to love, is this learned automatically or taught by someone else? I certainly must not know the answer. Because I'm so eager for every day I even forget that I'm breathing. Somehow it's nice, is't it? I wonder if I will become old like that? Sorry, just a moment. Hello! What happened? Hey! What should I do? I guess there's not much one can do in the face of death. I’m really sorry for making you come all the way to here. No. She wouldn't listen to me, this woman. Actually, I have something to talk about with Hiro-chan. What is it? Say, won't you come back to our world? Our office will manage you, right? No, I... We will take care of your management, but you have to pass the audition first. Don't hesitate, Hiro-chan. Never ever. I couldn’t do it anymore. I've been away from this business since years. You can't know that if you don't try. Saeko-san, don't force her. Everyone has their own idea of happiness. There's nothing wrong with that. It's not that I want to make her an idol. You can have a partnership, of course. Toru-san isn't my partner. Then, what is he to you? You could say we share the same values. Values? Do you know a poet named Ito Nagi? This is the point we have in common. Right? What kind of poems? How can I say? If you enjoy the trivial things in your daily life, you will be eager for every day. I see. So it is, isn't it? No, I think you're wrong. Aikawa-san, you know the truth, don't you? You are lying to yourself about your feelings. Your wish to do acting. How can you say this? I can tell by looking at you. Toru-san, what do you know of me? Come on, don’t argue here. Ito Nagi’s poems are not a consolation. So, Toru-kun, you think Hiro-chan wants to do acting again? Stop it please. I've had enough of it. These personal attacks, for example. Getting hurt and hurt again because of some remarks you make. I also know that various things happened, but... At that time I thought it was good if I had died. Till today I think so. What are you saying? Don’t say such things. But that's how I think, really. That's not true. If I had died at the time, it had been the best moment for the actress Aikawa Hirono. That's why I said you were lying to yourself! Don't talk so loudly. There's still a lot of time in the future. Everything is possible, isn't it? Okay, okay. Calm down, calm down. What's that? Why are you crying? I hate it. When I'm together with Aikawa-san, I hate myself. Okay, let's go outside. I'll call a taxi. Did he forget that? No. It's mine. I see. Even if I lose it, it always comes back to me. Sorry, sorry. I'm sorry. I've never seen the sunrise. I've thought about what you said. Something I've never done, something I want to try. Then I remembered I had never really seen the sun rising at the horizon from the ground or the waterfront. Indeed, I've also never seen it. I guess there are many of such people, right? It's nothing special at all. Say, there's a poet with the same name as you. Have you perhaps read her poems? Nagi! That's bad. My mother is calling me. Okay, see you next time. Then, I will come for a visit. But I will reject pajamas. Each time when I was hospitalized, everyone who visited me brought me pajamas. "Oh, I see." "From now on I'll have to stay in bed all the time", I thought. Nagi! Tell me if you go somewhere! I hate it if you go to the toilet without saying a word like last time. Next time I will properly tell you. Sorry. - For sure? - For sure! Young lady! For you, young lady. Thank you! You're welcome. ... or taught by someone else? I certainly must not know the answer. Because I'm so eager for every day I even forget that I'm breathing. Shall we go? A friend of yours? Well, kind of. Yes, she's still alive. Ito Nagi-san. The author of "K"? It was recently broadcasted on TV. She wrote it at the time when she was admitted to this hospital. When she was admitted? 4 years ago?! You see, she suffers from a blood disease since her childhood. When she was 14, her condition deteriorated and she was admitted to this hospital. In the time before, she had been repeatedly hospitalized and discharged. So she's been living in hospital most of the time. She says she wanted to go to high school and is working hard. But she's alive. Ito Nagi. [ Alice's Adventure in Puzzle-Land ] [ 20 Beautiful Sunrises in Japan ] Here, for you. That's what I wanted! Thank you. Here you go! Thank you. Excuse me, despite this girl's outer appearance her physical health is actually not very good. That's why exhausting things... I won't do something like that. Don't worry. Really? Then, I'll go a little shopping, okay? Have a nice day. Why? She was supposed to be already dead. Ito Nagi. I was told if I was dead, the book would sell well. My father has also published several books, but it seems I've sold about as much as him. That's the only reason? It's very important to communicate it to everyone that I am here. That I'm not just sleeping and waking up in my pajamas. New poems, won't you write them? Now, I find numbers more enjoyable. Because you can get a clear answer. That's comforting. Words are disquieting. This is my remaining lifetime. A friend installed it for me. Good, isn't it? It's an important number. This guy, he said until this became zero I should do what I wanted. What I brought you aren't pajamas. It's this. It was difficult get something fitting, though. - Are you alright? - Don't worry. Sorry, I've kept you waiting! You're late! Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's because of club activities. I see. Sorry. Let's go. I want something to eat. Okay, let's go eating. Let's go. Yoshimura-kun! Yoshimura-kun! Yoshimura-kun! He's so cool! Yoshimura-kun, who's that? Number 10 in the red jersey. That guy is attractive? What are you saying! He's super-attractive, isn't he? Yeah, super-attractive. He's so cool! Yoshimura-kun! Did you see that shot? Great, wasn't it? It was really great! He's so cool, isn't he? He's so cool! Yoshimura-kun! Hurry up! Good-bye. Good-bye. Good-bye. Well then, I'll call the roll. Number 1, Ito Nagi-san. Yes! And now, a question to Nagi-san. What is it? What does the title of the poem collection "K" mean? K is the K in "kimochi" (feeling). I see. So K is the K in "kimochi". And recently I devised this formula. That's it. What could this mean? There's a meaning in this? "i" means "me". "y" means "you". However, "i" and "y" can't be equal. "i" is "me", "y" is "you". But "i" and "y" can't be equal. What could that mean? Here's a hint. Possibility. And, these factors are drawn to each other. Furthermore, this formula was devised after I met you. That's 3 hints. Probability? After you met me? Drawn to each other? I haven't the slightest idea. Try to think about it. "i" is me, "y" is you... Hey, you! Don't play around here. Hurry up and go home. - Yes. - Yes. Oi! Wipe that off. Wait a moment. In which class are you? Hey, wait! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! 1 - 2, 1 - 2, 1 - 2... Sorry. I've kept you waiting. You're late! Sorry, sorry. Just a moment. Get on. Let's go back. You must be pretty tired. What's wrong? I... really want to see the sunrise. Besides, I'm hungry. And you? Isn't there anything you want to do? No, not really. Isn't there someone you like? You said there was someone you liked. No, there isn't. I don't know such a person. That's dangerous! I would like to try cooking. What? I would like to try cooking. Okay. And there's someone I want to call. Who? Tell me. That's dangerous. I can’t bear to see it. You must turn the potato, okay? Turn the potatoe... Don't move the knife, just turn the potatoe. Just turn the potatoe. - Right, right. - Okay. - Let me show you. - Yes. Yes, that's right. Right, right, right. You're a high school girl already. What have you been doing? Sleeping all the time, I guess. Before you become an old woman, you must have learned to prepare some tasty dishes, right? Then I have to hurry. Toru. Say... Good evening. Welcome! We'll be ready soon. Please come in and take a seat. Good evening. Pleased to meet you. I'm Ito Nagi. Good evening. She's that Ito Nagi. That Ito Nagi? That one. That one. What are you saying? It can't be her. No, it's really her. It's really me. Are you resurrected? Resurrected! - Oi, Oi, tell me what happened! - You startled me. Say, is she real? - Who knows? - Don't say, "Who knows". Tell me clearly! Yummy! Nagi-chan, this is super-delicious! Is it really the first time you cook? Tatsuya-kun, you're overdoing things. However, as for her cooking, we have to admit that it's good, right? Toru, try it too. - Itadakimasu. - Bon appetit. - Delicious! - It is, isn't it? - It’s delicious, right? - I'm so glad. - You're a cooking genius. - What? I'll try the fried chicken. What's wrong? What's with you suddenly? Why are you making such a face? Have you been in hospital? I got a call from the insurance company. But even without that call I could tell. By your face, for example, and your voice. You don't have to worry. Don't try to play your mother for a fool, okay! What's that supposed to mean? You've always been like this. When times are the toughest, you don't speak a word. Making others worry doesn't help anyone. After all, everyone is alone when they die. Ah, right. In case my condition becomes serious, I'll hide somewhere. Like a cat. So I won't inconvenience you. Isn't that what only elephants do? - No, cats. - No, elephants. - Cats! - Elephants! - Definitely cats! - Definitely elephants! - Why are you so sure? - Toru-kun, you're wrong. Doing this isn't considerate. It will only make your mother more sad. Don't say that. Toru is like he is. Toru-kun, you're not alone. That's how it is. So it is, isn't it? Of course it is! Toru! The one who brought you into this world is me! I won't let you die just as you please! Look, now she's angry. Alright. I'll tell you the truth. Okay. I'll help you to get over these bitter feelings. Thank you. Say, will Ito Nagi write no poems anymore? Shouldn't you better start making music again? I have played enough already. Didn't you just abandon the band and resigned? It was not like this. He was the superstar on a cultural festival. I would like to hear you too. Well, if Ito Nagi would write the lyrics for me, I would be willing to compose the music for it. Are you alright? Here. Take it. Thanks. Let's go. - Bye. - See you. Bye-bye! The sea! Amazing. I can step on your shadow in the moonlight. It’s too hard to step on it. Say, why don't you write poems anymore? Because it makes you uneasy? I declared I was dead for yet another reason. My poetic potential is exhausted. That book was all I had to give. I can only wait for death now, but I can't write anything anymore. I can't think of anything. I have heard them. Those were your words. Someday, you'll write again. Nagi, it's almost there. Nagi. Nagi. Nagi. Nagi? Nagi! Nagi! We are on the way to the coastal road. Come quickly! Come quickly please! We're almost there now. Do you want something to drink? Nomiya-san! Raise your head. Nomiya-kun. You may think we confined Nagi to bed. But look, we are grateful for every single day she can live longer. So please try to understand us. - But me and Nagi-san... - Please! Don't approach our daughter anymore! I'll try to be polite to you despite of this incident. Good, isn't it? - That's the best, isn't it? - It's great. That sucks. Tatsuya. Toru?! Sorry, I've kept you waiting. Here. Thank you. I'm glad nothing happened. To Nagi-chan, and also to you. Tatsuya. Perhaps I've become a little weird in the head. I'm glad that Nagi is safe and sound. But I'm more sorry that I couldn’t let her see the sunrise. Weird, isn't it? No. That's not weird at all. In case you haven't realized yet, let me tell you. You are in love with Nagi-chan. At that time, I thought your fate was to meet Aikawa Hirono. But, your fate was to meet Ito Nagi, right? Great, isn't it? You did very well. Then, I'll be back, okay? It was fun, wasn't it? Last time. I had so much fun. Where shall we go next time? Where shall we go, the both of us? For a special day one day is enough. My father, my mother, the hospital staff, I think they all will be sad when I'm dead. Therefore, until that happens, I don't want to make them sad anymore. It was nothing special. I'm a little tired. Can we do this until I fall asleep? I haven’t played in a movie for a long time so I'm very nervous, but I'm very grateful to my manager and Okuda-san who encouraged me. What made you come back after 5 years? I thought I wouldn't return to this business. It takes courage to come back. But then I read a poem which I liked very much and this poem gave me self-confidence. Excuse me! A delivery for you! Okay! If anything happens, call me right away. Have you been in hospital recently? I only go for a scan from time to time. I see. You don’t meet with Nagi-chan? This here is the formula that Nagi devised. It's a mathmatical problem that Nagi gave me. "K" is the K in "kimochi" (feeling). I understand half of it, but... "i" means "me". "y" means "you". However, "i" and "y" can't be equal. Furthermore, possibility, these factors are drawn to each other, and, this formula was devised after I met you. These are the 3 hints. I have no idea at all. It’s a riddle, isn't it? A riddle? I don’t completely understand, but "K" means "feeling", right? So "i" and "y" should also mean the feelings of two people. So this here is me and this here is you. And if they come closer to each other, their feelings come closer too. Sort of, right? The closer "i" and "y" come, the larger the value of "K". If they are drawn to each other and come close, their possibilities also become huge. I see. That's it! After she met me, this formula is what Nagi wanted to tell me. The solution is not a number but a feeling. This is a message. What's this? Unlimited? Nagi says if we both feel the same, our possibilities are unlimited. That's what she wanted to tell me. I'm sorry. Did I wake you up? I feel alright now. The uneasiness is gone. Okay. Nagi. I... love you. Tomorrow, the weather seems to be good from the morning. What are you doing? And what are you up to? I'm sorry. Time is running out. Why do you say such a thing? You are dying. I heard it. So don't make such a mess. Rather think about how to make the best use of your time. I'm making the best use of it. Living is not a question of time, I think. I'm sorry. Mom, I... want to go with Toru-kun. Mom... You can't go in such an outfit. Thank you. Wait! Let me say only this. Your mother loves you. I'm sorry. What I really wanted to show you isn't this. My hand, thank you for holding it. Please come in. Nagi-chan's parents left this to Nomiya-san. But Nomiya-san's eyes are not very good now. That's why he said we should give it to you. Tat... Tatsuya... Let me hear it, your song. I want to hear it. You love music, don't you? Yeah. Until the countdown hits zero, we must do what we like, right? The both of us. Toru! I'm glad. You were not in the patient's room and I wondered what I should do if you tried to jump down again. Today, my intentions are good. It's done. The song. It can't be helped, huh? I guess I'll have to sing it to you. It's indeed a special service. Don't expect it a second time. In the first place, I had no intention to write a song. Still, thank you. I wonder if it will get through. To everyone. Okuda-san! Shall we have lunch together? Sorry, I have to go there first. Akikawa-san. I heard from the staff that you always study here. Can I sit down? Do you know this song? They say it's a poem of Ito Nagi. [ Love Ballad ] [ Lyrics: Ito Nagi Composition: Sakamoto Tatsuya ] . [ Love Ballad ] [ Lyrics: Ito Nagi Composition: Sakamoto Tatsuya ] I heard that you like it. Well, I also bought Ito Nagi's poem collection and read it, but somehow this song seems different from Ito Nagi's works. Do you want to hear it? I'll begin. This is for you who I love so much so listen to me without laughing. "I love you", somehow sounds corny, doesn't it? But exept with these words there's no way I could tell you. Hey, you're laughing and making fun of me again, right? This is the road you've chosen and who knows if it's good, but there was no other one. In all those days of crying and laughing to stand by your side may be the meaning of my existence so I dedicate this love ballad to you. Say, what did we talk about that day? We were so unfamiliar on the first day we met. Since then, a lot has happened. We had our quarrels now and then but slowly began to understand each other, right? Under this vast sky above us let's meet again and again until all eternity. In all those days of crying and laughing to stand by your side may be the meaning of living with you so I dedicate this love ballad to you. I'm sorry for always giving you trouble. I always give you a hard time, right? I can't refrain from inflicting wounds on the two of us. So I give this clumsy love song to you, swear to the gods, "I love you like crazy", and will keep holding your hand from now on. Until I get hoarse I will always be by your side and keep singing this love ballad. When I get older, my voice will become hoarse, but I will still hold your hand and never stop saying, "Thank you". Even in the future, we will laugh together and be happy. And there will be so many nights when I sing of my love to you. [ Ai Uta = Love Ballad ] Tatsuya, it seems your resurrection is complete. Somehow it was strange that the band disbanded, wasn't it? Could it be you destroyed yourself so that your next life would become interesting? I should try to die too. People all die someday. - But you are back, aren't you? - Yeah. I'm glad that I made it in time. Thanks to him. Made it in time? What's that supposed to mean? See you, okay? I have to go.
