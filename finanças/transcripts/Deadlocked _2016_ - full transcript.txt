Another day to live through. Better get started. - You know, if you took the stairs more, you might catch me next time. - I don't know if you're aware of this but you're in handcuffs right now, buddy. - Yeah, but that's not because you caught me. Now, you wouldn't have stood a chance if that freak didn't snitch on me. - You mean the elderly citizen who restrained you? - Well, I didn't wanna hurt him. - Right. - Hold the door. - Got an audition to be at. - See if you can call the front desk. Yeah. - Yeah. Hi. So the elevator's stuck. You kiddin' me. This crap's gettin' old. - Wait, how often does this happen? Look, I'll get the elevator company over here just as soon as I can. Okay. And how long has this gonna take? Shouldn't be too long. Could you be more specific with the time? No. Sorry about this, everyone. We'll have you out of there as soon as we can. - Let me see if there's anything I can do about this. 1306 to 782. You guys out? I'm in front waiting. - Actually, we're stuck on the elevator. Are you serious? Are you guys alone? - Negative. How soon you think you can have us out of here? Daniels, I hate to break it to you, but I think you're on elevator patrol for the afternoon, kid. I gotta go. I'm getting a call for a 1016. - Okay. Stay safe. - Well, looks like we're not going anywhere for a while. We should probably take these off, yeah? - So you're new to the force, huh? I'm sorry. I'm Connor. - Officer Daniels. - And what's your name? - Me? - Yeah. - Oh, sorry. Just not you used to anybody talking to me while I'm cuffed. I'm Mason. - Well, it's nice to meet you, Mason. - Sir, let's avoid touching the perp please. - Sorry. Man, they're trying to freeze us to death in here or what? - Dude, it's boiling in here. - You're warm? - Yeah. What's happening? - It's all right. They're just working on the elevator. - What are you talking about? It's not all right. I'm gonna miss my audition no thanks to this brat. Everything was fine until you got here. - Sir, lower your voice. - Do you know what you've done? This was going to be my role of a lifetime. I was going to make it. Excuse me, everyone. Connor here. Hey, Jen. Hey. Yeah. Well, the craziest thing just happened. The elevator got stuck. Yeah. So unfortunately I don't think I can get to this audition. Well, I was wondering, is there any possibility I could schedule another one? No, it's okay. No, I totally understand. Okay. Well, hopefully we'll be working together sometime in the future. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you, I appreciate it. Talk to you soon. All right, bye. C'est la vie. What's up? - I think you owe her an apology. - I'm sorry, did I miss something? - You yelled at her. - When the lights went out? You blamed her for missing your audition. - It's fine. Can we just drop it please? - I don't know what you guys are talking about. I mean, I'm gonna miss my audition, but it's okay. I mean, it could have been a huge opportunity but there'll be plenty more. - Stop it. You're freaking her out. Just apologize. - I'm not freaked out, okay? - This is a prank, right? - I don't know. You tell me. - I'm really sorry. - We're not the ones you need to apologize to. - Hey. Hello? I'm Connor. - Yeah, you're Connor. You said that to everybody here already. - Well, what's your name? - Jacqui. Okay. - Jacqui. I'm really sorry for whatever happened back there. I'm seriously really sorry that I scared you . - I'm not scared, okay? It's fine. - What's up with the backpack? - So Connor, why don't you tell us about yourself? You're an actor? - Well, aspiring actor, yes. - Have you suffered any head trauma recently? - Huh? - Did you hit your head or anything? - No. Are you taking any substances? - Are you asking if I take drugs? - I'm just concerned about your wellbeing. - I don't do drugs. - Dammit, cop. Just ask him if you hear something. - Do you have power outages here often? - This is weird, even for this place. - So, it's Olivia, right? I never caught what you do. - Mechanical engineer. - So why do you live here? I heard at career day that engineering jobs pay really well. - Miss, why aren't you in school right now? Help! - Sir. Help! - Sir, the elevator's stuck. I'm a police officer. What's going on out there? My girlfriend's trying to kill me. - I've been there before. - Sir, I need you to get to a safe place. I'm gonna send- 1306 to dispatch. Talk to me. Are you all right? - Shit! - Dammit, Mason. - Asthma. 1306 to dispatch. - I don't have my inhaler. - Dispatch, where are you? - I've got this. Just take care of Connor, okay. Jacqui, Jacqui, look at me. Okay. - Connor. - Hi officer. I'm Connor. - Okay, Connor. I'm gonna have you sit down right over here, okay? - What's wrong with her? - You can do it, slow breaths. - Hey, you need to get the fire department and an ambulance down here right now. - Focus on me. Let it out, slowly. Okay. Good, deep breaths. Okay, good. Hello? This is dispatch. Go ahead, 1306. Over. - I'm stuck in an elevator with three civilians and a perp in an apartment building on 5th Avenue. - It's the Palmer apartments. - It's the Palmer apartments. I believe we're stuck somewhere near the fourth floor. I'm requesting fire, medical and backup. This is an emergency. I heard a violent altercation in the hallway and we have a young female in here who's suffering from respiratory problems, and a young male suffering from drug withdrawals or an overdose or something. Send help, over 10-4, 1306. Checking on available units. Over. - I don't do drugs. - See? You got through it. Won't be long now. Just keep breathing. Stay with me. 1306, all available personnel are currently handling other emergencies, but we will send the first available units. ETA is two hours. Over. - Come again? ETA is two hours. We're flooded with calls right now. Over. - It's okay. They always overestimate the amount of time they need, okay? It's okay. Just keep breathing. Good. Nice, long breaths. 1306. - Look, I don't know if it's fast enough. This girl's asthma is terrible. There's gotta be something else we can do. Some sort of alternative. Maybe I can get some outside help. Negative, 1306. Hold tight and wait for us. I understand the situation, but the safest thing for you and everyone in there is to stay right where you are. Trying to exit or tamper with that elevator equipment creates an incredibly dangerous situation. Understood? Over. - 10-4. Over. Hang in there, officer. Over and out. - It's too long, okay? Her asthma's really, really bad. And with him acting like that, we're gonna need her inhaler really soon. - Ma'am, I appreciate your concern and all your help but there's nothing else I can do here. - Yes, there is, sir. Look, I have personal experience with this elevator. I know how it works. - What? - It's a long story, okay? The point is, I can get us help. All I need to do is open these doors. If we're lucky, we'll be opening on a floor and we can just walk right out of here. - I can't permit any tampering with the elevator. - Tampering's a strong word for what we'd be doing. We'd just be opening the doors. - The dispatcher said it was dangerous, so- - No, it's not. I mean, it's... There's a slight risk for only you and me. Nobody else in this room. I'm willing to take the risk and I think you are too. Why did you become a cop? To enforce some rules or to help people? 'cause there's a girl in this room that needs your help right now. So what's it gonna be? - I can't. Olivia. I'm sorry. - Tell that to her. - Keep it together, loser. Jacqui, I need to see your phone. - Why? We need to call your parents. - You don't have to call my dad, I'm... - He needs to know what's going on here. Let's do this the easy way. - Just do what he says, Jacqui. Thank you. Hi, this is Nathan Fields. Sorry I couldn't take your call right now but please leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as possible. - Hi, Mr. Fields. I'm officer Daniels and I'm here with your daughter, Jacqui. And she's having some asthma issues at the moment. If you can give me a call back when you get this, that would be appreciated. Thank you. Connor. - Sorry. 1306. - Olivia. All right, so how do we do this? - Okay. Well, we're gonna need his help. Mason? With what? - Somebody needs to watch her. Otherwise her asthma is gonna get worse. - Yeah. He's not exactly the guy for that job. - Well, we don't exactly have a more qualified candidate, do we? - Mason. Get over here. - So how can I help, John McClain? - We need you to sit with Jacqui. Just talk to her and keep her calm while we open these doors. - Wait, wait, is that a request or a command? Pretty sure you can't force me to babysit against my will. - Fine. Then it's a request. - Oh well, I'd be happy to help them. So what do I get in return? Come on. - Just tell us what you want. - Okay, well, for starters, take these cuffs off. No. We can't trust him. He's dangerous. Yeah, 'cause I might steal your wallet. - Mason, please. - Okay. Fine. I'd take some booze. - What? - Yeah. Come on. I saw you sneaking something in the corner there. - Okay. Go. - And don't let her look at Connor, okay. Anything you have to do to keep your mind off the asthma. - Yeah, I can do that. Hi. - One. Two. Three. - Jeez, take it easy. You're talking my ear off here. Oh, so what's in the bag anyway? Can I look? I'll just take that as a yes. Ow! Easy, kid. - Don't call me a kid, dumb ass. - Okay. - Now what. - Let go on three. One. Two. Three. - Well, we're not getting out that way. - Maybe we don't have to. Someone could bring us the inhaler. - Olivia. - You come prepared, girl. - Thanks. - We need something to wedge these doors open. - Well, we got nothing. - Would this work? - That'll do it. - Hey, officer. - How are you feeling, Connor? - Pretty good, really? - You want some water? - Sure. Why not? - Hey, hey. You can't look at him. - They're not watching. - I'm worried about him. - You'll still get your booze. Yeah, I heard you guys talking. You weren't exactly quiet and oh yeah, you were like five feet over there? - Look, look, that wasn't about the booze, okay? That cop, he thinks he can make me do whatever he wants. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Just shut up about it, okay? I get it. Again, on three. - Let me see him. I will punch you again. - Fine. - Is he gonna be okay? - Look, you just worry about yourself, okay? - Jack, look at me, it's okay. Hey, guys. - That's it! What happened? - What did you do? - Man, look cop, there's something seriously off with this dude. Hey look, his eyes were all screwed up for a second. When she saw that, her asthma flared up again. You gotta do something about this guy. - I knew I couldn't trust you. - And you're not listening. Some scary shit just went down here, okay? You really gotta do- - Hey, I don't wanna hear it. - Officer. He's telling... - Jacqui, Jacqui. Don't talk, okay? Just focus on your breathing. Okay? - Hello! Can anyone hear me? We're in the elevator. We need help. What are you doing? - I'm recruiting my sister to get that inhaler. Ali. - Liv, I just heard a bunch of gunshots in the hall. - Are you okay? There's something going on in the hall. - Sir, sir, we're in the elevator. We need help. - Okay, just lock the door? I'm gonna be there as soon as I can. Everything's gonna be okay. Listen, there's someone in here with really bad asthma. Can you please go to her apartment and get her inhaler? Please. - Yes. Yes, of course. - Thank you. Hold on one sec. - 605, probably on the kitchen counter. - Okay. No, no, no. Don't put your hand in here. That's how you lose it. I'm gonna just toss it to you, okay? It's apartment 605. Probably somewhere on the kitchen counter, okay? - All right. I'll be back as fast as I can. I'm John from 419. You're Olivia, right? I think I've seen you around before. Got it. Going. - Thank you. - Nice work. Thanks. - Nice work yourself, officer. - Lee. - I don't know any other Lees. No, I lied. Lee Harvey Oswald. - Oh yeah. - Yeah. - Harvey. - Olivia, officer Lee. - You didn't hold up your end of the bargain. We can't give this guy an inch. - Come on. Let's keep the peace. - Oh. Ooh! - One drink is plenty. - Oh, come on. I'll let you hit me with public intoxication. - Here, officer. You need this more than any of us. - I'm not off duty till five. - You're not gonna offer me any? What? You don't think I can handle my liquor? Is that it? - Calm down. Nobody's saying that. You're just feeling a little under the weather. So we're just gonna- - Don't tell me how I feel, bitch. - Don't look at him, Jack. - Well, hello. - Do you mind if I touch your forehead? - Are you the makeup lady? I'm really excited for today's scenes, especially the kissing one. - Okay. Okay, you're really warm. - Jacqui, can you get us another water bottle for Connor? - What if I don't wanna give him any? - The fever's making him act like a weirdo. Water's gonna help. - 1306 to 782. Hey, go ahead 1306. - Matthews. What happened? I couldn't get a hold of you earlier. I was in radio silence on the 1016. It's a long story. Listen, things are crazy. So I don't got a lot of time, kid. - Things are crazy here too. We've got a girl with severe asthma and a guy who's running an extremely high fever. And there's been some violent sounds in the building. Yeah. Sounds like the apartments I remember. Listen Daniels, I gotta run. I'm on my way to a 1034 downtown. - Did you say a 1034? Yeah, I just geared up. I'm heading there now. - All right, well, take care of yourself, partner. Stay safe. Over and out. - What's a 1034? - Rioting. - Rioting? - Here. - Okay. Help. - Shut up. - Where's everyone going? What's happening? - Hey. - Come on. - He's trying to get her. - Jacqui. Come here, look at me. We're gonna take one of those deep, slow breaths. Okay? Look at me. No. Slow breaths. Look at me. Can you please, Jacqui. Come on, Jacqui. - Let me in, let me in, let me in. - Inhaler. - Help me in, Olivia. - John, give me the inhaler now. Here, Jacqui. Oh my God. - Lee. I'm really, really sorry, Lee. - Hey dude, hey don't do that. - Officer, help me in. - Sir. I'm ordering you to stop. You're gonna get chopped in half. - Olivia, pull me in please. They're coming. - Who's coming? - Well, pull me in, pull me in. Pull, pull. - Boost me up. - Olivia, no. We need to close this. - Mason, boost me. John. Are you all right? What happened to your leg? John. I don't see anything. - What happened to John? - I don't know. He's just, his leg was all bloody. He just limped away. - Mom. I want my mommy. - She's gonna get in here. - Everyone, close the door. - Get her off. Get her off. - Stop moving. - Ali. Hey. Olivia, there's a dead woman in your room. - What? I don't know. I just stepped away for like two minutes. She must've come in then. - Okay. Okay. You need to call the cops, okay? Don't leave the apartment. Just lock the door. There's something happening in the building. What do you mean? - I don't know. People are going crazy. What? - Just lock the door and call the cops, okay? Just don't leave. Okay. Okay. - Okay. I love you. I love you too. - Okay, bye. - 1306 to dispatch. Do you copy? 1306 to 782. - I don't think he's breathing, man. - Wait. Hang on. Stop. You don't wanna get what he has. - That's smart. - He moved. I just saw him move. - Are you sure? - Connor. Connor, wake up. Connor, calm down. Connor, stop. - Lee. - Stop moving, that's an order. - Lee, come on. - I wanna help you. Will you let me do that? Connor, stop. Please. - Lee. - Jacqui, can I use this? - Hey Jack, you got anything else in there that could help us out? Well, this could come in handy. - They're not picking up. - What? - 911, I've called like five times. No one's answering. - Why wouldn't they be answering? - There's a bunch of weird noises outside. I don't know what's going on. - Help me with these doors. - What are you doing? - That woman over there was gonna fit in here. That means I can squeeze out. - Yeah, or let all of them in. - We need to talk about this first. - There's nothing to talk about. It's my sister and I'm going. Please. - Idiots. Wait, I'll get that side. I have a feeling we're probably gonna need that gun. - Jacqui. - Yup. - Put this in the door when they get it open. Okay. - Ready? One. Two. Three. - Okay now, Jack. - I got it. - Do you hear that? - I don't hear anything. - Sh! Close the door. That was John, wasn't it? - She's okay. She's okay. - Backup will be here any minute. They'll send a whole squad to get her. Wait, what, that's your plan? Yeah. - Look, 911 is not working, there's rioting. You can't even get a hold of anybody. Things are going south, fast. - They'll be here. I'm not giving up on them. - How long are we gonna wait? Till her sister dies? Till the power goes out and we're stuck in here forever? Look, I'm a big boy. I ain't squeezing outta here, all right? Look, we need a plan. - Come on, dad. - Hey, what about you, MacGyver? What do you got? You're an engineer or something, right? I mean, how would you get us out of here? - If I could get up to the control room, I could get this elevator moving. - I don't like any plan where you leave this elevator alone. Hi, this is Nathan Fields. - Matthews. I'm here, we still need help. Emergency evacuation. Over... Fire... - Matthews repeat. Okay. Let's get you up to that control room. - Okay, so how are we gonna do this? - It's quiet. Let's get these doors ready. Come on. - I'm about to be up there. Listen, Olivia. I hear loud noises getting going. They're all angry. - Okay. You need to hold on for just a few more minutes. I'm about to be up there. - Jacqui. - Yeah. - Cover us. - Really? - Ready? - Pull. There's so many in the hall. I can't get out of here and get past them. - I'm bringing back up. - Jack, now. - Good. - Just sit tight. I'm gonna see you really soon. - Liv, give me your phone. - Okay, I'm gonna bring the elevator up to the top floor. We're gonna take 'em out together. - Look, I know you're gonna want to move fast, but you need to be quiet too. These things are loud. If you alert one, you might alert them all. - Here. I set it up. - You guys really wanna do a video call. - It's a good idea. That's the best way for us to know what's happening. - Hey, don't screw this up. - Boost me. - Wait. Take this. You know how to use it? - Yeah. - Good. There's two extra mags in the front there. - Thank you. - Well, here we go. - So far, so good. No sign of 'em. I don't like this, it's so quiet. Anything happening down there? - No, no, nothing. - What was that? - Shut up. She's trying to listen. - Sorry. - What is that? - Olivia, hide. Okay, I'm gonna keep moving. Here, you guys watch the stairwell below. I'm gonna keep an eye out for anything above. - Well, your shoes look great. - Sorry. I can't hold this while... Ow! - Olivia? - This video call idea sucks. How do I turn that off? - Olivia, there's something up there. - Go back down. I don't hear anything. - Did you mute it? - No, they were insanely quiet. Be careful. They're headed downstairs. Looks clear to me. Damn it, not again. Okay. - Well, that's it. - She just needs a few minutes. One new message. Jacqui. Remember that time we camped by the lake? You and mom made that whole bag of marshmallows? I was so proud of you, Jacqui. Your mom would be proud of you. Listen, you've gotta be strong for me now, okay? I love you, Jack. - Are you okay? - Do you hear that? What? - Listen. - That sounds like a kid. - Let me look. It's a little girl. Hey. Come on. I can fit out here. I have to go get her. - No, no. Now let me look. - It's too dangerous, Jacqui. - If I don't go out there, they're gonna get her. I'm not asking for your permission. - We can't protect you out there. - I don't need protecting. - Right. Look, Olivia had a real gun. - You're just assuming that something bad happened to her. - She said those things are on their way down here now. That girl crying is drawing them in as we speak. - Which means that I need to go get her right now. - No, no. Don't let her do this, man. I got a bad feeling. - Lee, I need to do this. Please. Are you guys just gonna sit here and listen to this kid die? - Listen to me. You're gonna do this as quickly and quietly as possible. If she resists, you clamp her mouth shut and drag her back here. Don't be gentle. You're saving your life, you understand? - Yeah. - Mason, boost her. - Ready? - Yeah. - Good luck. - Hey, little girl. Hey, hey, are you all right. - Lee, Lee, get off. Hold on. Let me look at Jacqui's phone. I think that video auto saved. - Are you okay? Hey. Everything's gonna be okay. Shit, man. Look, right there. - Jacqui. Jacqui, don't. Olivia, is that you? Take us back down. Jacqui's not in here. - Jack, come on. - Get Jacqui. - Come on, Jack. - Let's go. Come on. - Stay back. Okay, you saw what happened to John after he was bit. He turned fast, I'll try to kill you. - We're not leaving without you. - No. Okay? No one else is gonna die because of me. - Mason, grab her. - What? Put me down. Do you wanna be the one that has to do it? Put me down. - Come on! I shouldn't have let you do that. - You didn't know. Lee. You didn't know. Okay, so we had to do, okay, so we... When's mom gonna be back? Okay, I got it, I got it. - Well? - There's three of them down there at the end. Pounding on the door. It's gotta be a stair well. - Three? I guess those came down to get us. - Yeah, well, if we take them by surprise, I think we've got this. - Guys. - Ali. Come on. Ali. Open up. - Oh shit! - Get down, get down. Here. - Where's the other mag? - Come on. Grabbed the belt, I had to ditch it. I'm sorry. - Olivia, hurry. - Ali. Ali. No. No. Lee. - Olivia. - Jacqui. Come on, kid. Your dad wants to play one of his games. - Jack. Jack. Jack. - Olivia. Olivia. - No. - Olivia. - No. - Jacqui. - When I do this, you're gonna shut the door behind me. - What? - Take care of each other, okay? Look after Olivia for me. - Come on, man. We've got maybe a couple of minutes before they break that thing down. So what's your plan? - I don't know. - Jacqui? - There's a ledge out here. We can make it across the other unit. Let's go. - Pack that up. - Yeah. - Olivia. I'm sorry, but we have to keep moving. - I'm not going anywhere. I'm staying with her. - Set the timer for three minutes. If we're not over there by then, we're dead. Leave without us. - What are you talking about, man? - There's no time. Just go. - Lee, man. She doesn't wanna go. - I know. - Look, if you stay here- - I know. I got this. Just go, Mason. Hey. Take care of yourself. - I always do. - What are you doing? Get out. - I don't leave until you do. - Then you're gonna die. - Lee. You're still here? - You haven't quite got rid of me yet. Let's get the hell outta here. - There's stairwells to the left. Let's try for that. Back.
