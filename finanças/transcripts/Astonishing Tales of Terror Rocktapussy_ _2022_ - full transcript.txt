What do you see? What is that? Hey, move. Let's push through. How deep does it go? I can't see the end. Huh. Are we going in? Whoa. Jesus, Churchy, what are you trying to do, blind me or something? Sorry, Bill. New camera. Yeah, well, you flash that thing in my face one more time, new camera or not, I'm gonna shove that expensive piece of shit where the sun don't shine, you understand me? Yeah, sure, Billy. I'm sorry. Yeah. How much you pay for that thing, anyway? Enough. Probably spent all of last month's paycheck trying to be something other than what you are. Oh, yeah? What's that? Couple losers, just like us. Come on. Shouldn't we tell the others what we found? Oh, what are you afraid of? Hey, maybe we find something down here we can actually keep for ourselves, huh? You don't tell anyone about this. Churchill. Churchill. - Churchill. - Come in, Churchill. Whoa. Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. I got you. What the hell? Hey, Billy. Buddy, buddy! Fuck! Help me, please! Oh, my god! Go, go! - What, what?! - Go! - Billy, what is it?! - Just run! Go, go, go! Churchy. Churchy, something's got me. Something's got me. - Come on. - Something's got me! Churchy, please. God, please. Billy! No! Churchill. Churchill. Churchill! What's it gonna take to get a little more than a dance? More? I just have one question. Anything, darling. On the record? Would you care to comment about the allegations of drug use and solicitation of prostitution that has plagued your time in office? What the hell is this? Are you involved in narcotic trafficking? If so, does the police board know about it? And if so, how can you actively lobby for the restrictions of such things if you yourself engage in what is, in your own words, "contemptible actions"? Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor! Needless to say, the mayor definitely has some difficult questions to answer in the coming days. Questions that this reporter is waiting for with bated breath. I'm Hunter Hazelton for Channel 8 News. For her role in uncovering corruption and fraud in the mayor's office congratulations to Hunter Hazelton on her nominations for Most Impactful News Story and News Person of the Year. Oh. Hi. Oh, hi. Oh. Hi. Mm. Hi. What is she thinking? She's giving us all a bad name. Well, speak for yourself. I'm above that kind of tabloid journalism if that's what you want to call it. Why doesn't she just go away and leave the news to the real reporters? Oh, look, here comes the future Pulitzer winner now. - Be nice. - Bite me. Hi, Declan, Annie. It's nice to see you both. Hunter, congratulations. Your expose on the mayor really touched a chord with a lot of people. Lot of hits. Thank you. It was difficult work, but I think we got some really incriminating footage. And the DA is opening up a new investigation. That is impressive work. But I got to say, that, uh, that incriminating footage really takes you back to that night in Vegas. Don't say it. Oh, that's right. You two used to be a thing back in the day. It was a long time ago, so... Still, there's history. And you two are a thing now. We are. Great. Does take me back, though, climbing the local news ladder. Drummond and Hazelton. We made a great team. We were a team. It wasn't good. Ouch. Feisty. I am happy for the both of you. Really. You know, Hunter, you shouldn't have to demean yourself to get this sort of attention. You can be a real reporter without the... dancing? Is that what that was supposed to be? Dancing? I mean, don't you think as a woman professional- Dressing up in that getup and dancing to get the eyeballs going, don't you think you're... Oh, how do I say this? Grasping? - A "real" reporter? - Yeah. The problem, Annie, with your type of feminism, is that it doesn't apply to all women. Only the ones whose beliefs and behaviors align with yours. Who's to say a woman can't be smart, funny, and sexy, all at the same time? Oh, the triple threat. Here's a fourth: if you don't stop being a bitch, I'm gonna stick my foot up your fake feminist fuck hole. Have a good evening. I heard you're nominated as well. I am. It's for... I don't care. Are you fucking kidding me? I'm sorry. I'm a fan of alliteration- - Ugh! - Come on, you got to admit, that was impressive. Dad. Hailey. - Hey. - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. Hi. Mm. I am so glad you guys made it. Of course. I'm not gonna miss my big sister's party. So... What do you guys think? My story was the top trending story this week. Most views, hits and likes. They re-upped my contract. I mean, this could really be the type of exposure I've been looking for. Because of, uh... Yeah. Because of my interview with the mayor. Well, congratulations. What? What's wrong? Well, you know Dad. It's just- - Hunter, you know I'm proud of you. I'm proud of both of you for everything you've been able to accomplish, you know? I know. And I love you no matter what you do, but do you have to do what you do dressed like that? Dad, I was undercover. Maybe next time be... more covered. You know, undergarments, all of it. You know, more. Congratulations. I'm very proud of you, honey. Really. Okay. I guess we'll catch up later? Okay. He's just Dad. I know. Congratulations, though. Agh. Seriously, it is so awesome. Thank you. Hey. Can't let all this great champagne go to waste. You did good, Hunter. You proved without a doubt that there's vice and corruption in the mayor's office. Hell, maybe we can finally clean up the city. You did good. Mm. You okay? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. No, you're not. I always wanted to be a part of their party. You know, wanted their invite, their awards, their approval. Guess I just wanted to belong. After all these years, I finally get noticed and it feels so... hollow. I have worked my entire life for this chance. I don't have kids. Never been married. I am turning 40 next month. Mm. Why does winning feel so bad? Mm... White privilege? Oh. We can only do our best, Hunter. You're a damn good reporter. I know that and you know that. To hell with what everyone else says. I mean, you work hard. Harder than most. And you care about the truth, wherever that may lead. And as for all the other stuff, maybe it feels hollow because it is, because it always has been. And you just have to fill it with meaning. When did you become such a philosopher? I'm gay. We are very self-aware. Right. Besides, haven't you heard? Journalism is dead. Who wants to belong to a dying cause? Well, then it's gonna be one hell of a ride. Oh, yeah. Mm. All right, I'll see you tomorrow. Goodnight. 'Night, Cam. You dance to the beat of your own drum, Hunter. That's not a bad thing. But it does get loud from time to time. I love you. I love you, too. Morning, darling. I hope you have a wonderful day. Morning, Carey. Eddie. Here to use the showers again? Yeah. You know, things with Abby. Hey, man, I'm not judging. Still seeing what's-her-name? Janelle? No. What happened? Turns out I'm an asshole. Ah, join the club, partner. - Have a good one. - See you later. Hey there, good buddy. Who's a good boy? Who's a good boy? Big day today. Mm. Good morning. - Morning. - Mm. Mm. - Mm. - Mm. Hunter, are you in there? Fuck. You overslept. I overslept. Hurry up, the test is gonna be in a couple... Holy shit. Uh. Yeah, Cam, this is, um... This is, um... Frank. Frank. This is Frank. Frank, this is Cam. - Hey. - Hey. You know, as a reporter, you'd think you'd ask more questions. That's fair. Give me a second, I'm gonna change. Just make it quick. We gotta go. Uh... So, um, you work out, I take it? Yeah. Yeah, so do I. I mean, not as much as you, but, um, I-I-I work it. Um, yeah. Hunter? Yeah. Okay. So this new mining tech, what do we know about it? Engineers from Canada, Russia, and the US developed a new prototype laser. Today's the grand unveiling. Limited press. Very exclusive. And our passes will be there waiting for us. Great. I'll do my hair in the van. Mm. Hi. I got to go, but last night was fun. The door will lock automatically on its way out and can you feed my cat before you leave? - Darling. - Asshole. Hm... You're still mad? You embarrassed me last night, Declan. Wasn't the first time. It won't be the last. Besides, you and I make a great team. Oh, like you and Hunter were a good team? We're better alone, thank you very much. Longest two weeks of my life. I was really hoping not to see you here. Yet, here we are. Still friends? Okay, just friends. I'm cool with that as long as we can still... Oh, it looks like they put everyone's A-team on this. Well, we can't let anybody just crash the party, now can we? Oh, you're a bad girl. Mm. You have no idea. Oh, I have some idea. Ah, hi, how can I help... Mr. Davis? Hi, Eddie. Huh, Mr. Davis, what are you doing here? Didn't you retire, what, two years ago? Yeah. No, no, two and a half. Well, how you been? I'm good, Eddie. I'm good. Look, I was wondering, I mean, I don't know, but... whether I might visit the old place. It's just, it's just me at the cabin. I don't get many visitors, you know, so I was wondering if- - Oh, yeah, the guys will be happy to see you. Thanks, Eddie. Yeah, I'll sign you in. Have a blast, huh? Hey, there. Great. It's not here. It's got to be. Oh, hi. Excuse me. Hi, I'm Hunter Hazelton. I'm here for the mining experiments, but my pass seems to be missing. Is there someone you can call? I'm sorry, everyone is already down there that has a pass and was invited. It's a restricted event. Very exclusive. Okay. Thanks. It's not here. Are you sure they were leaving it for us? Yeah. I'm sure. What time is it? It's 8:40. The test is gonna start. We gotta find a way down there. Don't look at me. I mean, you're the expert in infiltration. I have an idea. Sorry. Ah, Jesus. Don't be a baby. It wasn't hot. Excuse me, hi. Do you have a change room we can use? My cameraman spilled his coffee, so... Downstairs, down the hall, to your left. Great. Okay, come on. - Could've warned me. - There wasn't time. Okay, I'll be right back. Hold this. But that's the men's room. My shirt. Oh. Um... Think you're in the wrong place. Well, that all depends on what I'm looking for. Not sure how to answer that. I need your help. Again, not sure how to answer that. I'm Hunter Hazelton, Channel 8. I'm gonna keep my eyes up here. There was a mix-up with my press badge and I need to get down to where they're holding the experimental mining test. I know that's a lot to process, but if you can get dressed as quickly and help me out, that would be swell. I looked down. Great. I meant great. Not used to saying no to beautiful women when I'm standing in front of them with no pants on, so... So don't. This is a Channel 22 special report. We're going live on the scene to Annie Markowitz at the Morgan Mine. Annie? Thanks, Richard. I'm here with Russian engineer, Alek Nicolai, as he's about to reveal a technological breakthrough in the mining field. I really appreciate it. I owe you one. No problem. I'm Carey, by the way. Carey Barnes. Nice to meet you, Carey. See you around. You don't even know her, Carey. Just back to work and forget about the, uh, gorgeous, beautiful, approachable woman who entered and exi... Dammit. Ah, what are you doing? A breakthrough made possible through a trilateral partnership between the United States, Canada and Russia, in what hopes to be a new start to foreign relations. Safety first. I didn't think you were gonna make it, Ms. Hazelton. I'm glad you did. Well, from what I hear, we're gonna see some sci-fi shovelling. It's very exciting. Dr. Nicolai, tell us a little about your machine. There are minuscule pockets of energy in the air. Small charges, static shocks. Yee-haw. What our machine does is it takes these tiny shocks and combines them through a single prism. This focused laser can cut through the hardest materials with incredible accuracy- All without drawing power from anything but the air. Revolutionary, if I say so for myself. No longer will dangerous explosives be required and the lives of innocent men and women put at risk. It's the future of mining. If this works, I'll be in the unemployment line. I can't let you go any further. I have to stop you. What's he doing here? Who let him down here? You, turn that off. Turn it off! Now! Are you still rolling? Yeah. We all are. We've just received word that there is a developing situation at the Morgan Mine testing site. We're going live right now, but early reports suggest that what we're looking at is some kind of hostage situation. Viewer discretion is advised. Turn it off. Do it. You, turn it off. Do it now. Goddammit, do it! Okay. Okay. There, it stopped. I've turned it off. Hilly, what are you doing? Stay back. This is too important. More than you know. More than you can possibly know. I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen! What's he talking about, Marshall? The man is certifiable. He sent me a bunch of letters saying I shouldn't blast this side of the mine. I said don't dig here. I told you, it's too dangerous. Dig anywhere else, but not here. Hilly, what's going on? You can talk to me. Talk to me. We found something, something evil, all those years ago. I was only a kid then. But there's something here, deep underground. And it killed Billy. And Todd. And if you keep on going, you're gonna open the gates of hell and unleash the devil himself. You said you found something. What was it? I don't know, but it killed my friends. It took them away. All this time, I watched and I waited, I tried to keep people away from this corner, but I knew this time would eventually come. I've been preparing for this moment my whole life. I can't get it out of my head. Stop, goddammit, right there! You don't think I'm serious about this? Okay, okay. I just want to talk, Hilly. I want to know how to help you. Let me help you. Help me? No, don't you see? I'm helping you. You think I'm crazy, right? You think I'm making this up? Okay, you don't think I'm serious about this? I'll show you. I'm deadly fucking serious! Holy Shit. Jesus, Dad! Would it really kill you, just once, to answer the phone? What? Why? You haven't heard?! Heard what? Hailey. Hunter's down there, Dad. There's no way I'm gonna take any chances. Not again. It'll never take me alive. Churchill. What was that? You must've awakened it. Help me! Something's got... No! What's pulling him?! Help me! Me? Abandon hope, all ye who enter here! No! Oh, my god. Come on. Hunter! Hunter! Come on! This place is coming down around us! We have to go! An explosion has rocked the Morgan Mine. Hailey, she's gonna be okay. Hunter... Hunter's a survivor. Working underground at the testing site, and offer our prayers for their safety and well-being. Hello? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! It's me. It's me, Hunter. Carey. Remember? Oh, yeah. Carey. Oh, um, I'm sorry, I thought you were, um... You thought I was a giant monster coming to finish you off? Is that what that was? Honestly, I have no fucking idea. You saved me. Well, I wouldn't go that far. I carried you. I put you in the cart and I went looking for survivors. And? None that I could find but I found this. That's the bag the old man had before he went all... Churchill. His name is Churchill. You knew him. Yeah, I did. Electrical wire. Flashlights. An old photo of him and his mining buddies. And a gun. Oh. Oh, no. The, uh, the gun. Yeah. You know how to use one of those? Do you? My name's not Hunter because my parents were a bunch of hippies. I guess I should thank you. For what? For carrying me and making sure I was okay. Like I said, don't sweat it. It's the bare minimum I could do. In that case, I thank you for the bare minimum. You're welcome. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, I thought that... Oh. Oh. No, I was just, um, just thanking you, so... The time and place, stressful situation. So bare minimum deserves a kiss now? I was trying to be humble. Try harder. Okay, cool. All right. We should find a way out of here. I mean, there's still hope that the others are still alive and given the current circumstances of the, um... Giant monster. Giant monster down here with us, we shouldn't stay in one place. Agreed? Agreed. Let's go. Okay, easy, easy. Need to rest. How is he? Who, him? He's fine. He just lost a little blood. He'll be great. Da, comrade? Sure. I'll be fine. I don't believe it. He just, he just pushed the button and- - We all saw it, Annie. - Boom. Look, anyone that straps an explosive vest to their body and detonates him, or herself, is clearly deranged. Personally, it was terrorists. - No, it wasn't a terrorist. - Come on. I think he was trying to protect us. Protect us from what exactly? You're telling me you didn't see it? I have no idea what you're talking about. The giant octopus that attacked us? You can't tell me you don't remember. No, that's impossible. There has to be a logical explanation. - Yeah, terrorists. - No, he wasn't a terrorist. Ugh! I can't logically explain any of what just happened. But we all saw it, right? No, it's not possible, okay? We could all be suffering some mass delusion caused by a stressful situation. Ooh, or a gas leak maybe. Biological weapon. Did anybody get a good look at the vest because I'm positive he was all, like- - He wasn't a terrorist, man! - Well, I'm terrified, all right, man?! It wasn't a figment of our imagination! It was a giant goddamn octopus and it was real! It killed your cameraman, for Christ's sake! Okay! Okay, you're right! I'm sorry! It was as crazy as it sounds, a giant goddamn octopus! Oh, Jesus. I'm shaking. Oh, god. Here we go. - Does anybody have a smoke? - No! Hey. What was his name? Whose? Your, um, your cameraman. You don't know his name, do you? Yeah. It was... Camera Man. You got to be fucking kidding me. Well, I'm sorry if his name was hard to remember, okay? What's your name? It's Cam. Cam. Cam the cameraman. Piece of cake. I would've remembered that! Not good, huh? Not good. What are we gonna do? Die. Probably. Well, do we know if anybody else survived? No. It was chaos. Did you two see what happened to Hunter? - No. - No. Okay, we're not in bad shape. We're more than capable of figuring this out as long as we stay calm. - Okay. - We have two scientists at our disposal. We're gonna be fine. Cam? Yeah. He's dead. Okay, we have one scientist. So, what's your story? My story? Yeah. Who are you? Details, you know? I don't know about any story. You being a reporter right now? As opposed to when I'm being a damsel in distress who needs a big, strong man to save me and sweep me off my feet? I am just making conversation. And who knows how long we're gonna be down here? Hell, this might be the last conversation either one of us ever has. Carey Barnes. 44 years old. Former star quarterback. Scholarships, the whole 10 yards. Oh, um, nine yards. - What? - The saying. I mean, it's the whole nine yards, not 10. And, well, you said 10. Doesn't make any sense. It's 10 yards to a first down. Are you sure? Go on. Anyways, Uh, former star quarterback. Prom king. I married the prom queen. First year of college, I blew out my ACL and MCL and I missed the draft 'cause I didn't recover in time. Missed going to the pros. And I found myself losing for the very first time in my life. Wife and I decided to have a baby. Thought that maybe it would change things. And it did for a while. Made me forget who I used to be. For a while at least. And now? Divorced. I work here, digging really deep holes in the ground. Just trying to survive one day at a time. And I got to tell you, this day has thrown me for a loop. Whoa. Do we keep going? That's a yes. Look at that. There's a ledge on both sides. We can make it. Well, we can, but whoa. Did you ever play lava as a kid? You know, with couch cushions? Yeah. Well, this is just like that. Except with real lava that kills you instantly when you touch it. So, don't touch it. Goddammit. Would this be a bad time to ask something about you? Shoot. You always so gung-ho? What do you mean? Not looking before you leap. Danger in your blood. Shimmying across a narrow ledge with the potential to fall into a bubble bath of death. Calculated risks. I mean, I'm not gonna be some damsel in distress, just waiting for a man with a hero complex to save me. Hero complex? I follow my gut. Always. And, right now, my gut is telling me that that's the way to get answers. Do I want to know the question? Trust me. Don't let go! I'm trying really hard not to. Your knees? What's left of them. There's a ledge. Can you swing me over? Maybe. Okay, we can do this. I don't know. Carey. Carey. We can do this. Okay. You ready? - Yeah. - One. Two. Hey... we'll come back for him. I promise. Thank you. You actually think we're getting outta here? More likely, we're all gonna be buried down here together, 'cause if that thing doesn't kill us, the roof collapsing in probably will. Shut up, Declan. Oh, we are all gonna die horrible, horrible deaths. Declan! Shut up. They're not gonna leave us down here. They will find a way. Do you think? People buried in mine. It's ratings gold. And the longer this drags out, the more the network's gonna love it. "Declan Drummond buried alive." And I'm not even there to report it. Can't be that jaded. Look, kid, until you've sat in a network boardroom trying to figure out how to improve ratings, shut the hell up, 'cause I guarantee you right now, they're dragging the dead Russki's family out in front of the cameras and people are eating it up. No offense to your comrade. May God rest his commie bastard soul. - The hell is wrong with you?! - Oh, whoa, whoa, okay. Look, I got a bit of a condition, okay? And I get, like, when I'm in anxious or I'm in stressful situations, I just tend to blurt out whatever comes into my mind. I don't have a filter. Asian! Goddamn, sorry. Calm down, shut up. Okay. Thank you. You date this asshole? Uh, dated. Past tense. Okay, we broke up, like, yesterday, so the past tense thing- - Okay, and as much as I'd love to see you take a swing at him- Whoa. He's telling you the truth. He's an idiot. See? Told you. Doctor diagnosed. Yeah, I've even got medicine for days when it's bad. Well, take two. Well, that's not really the recommended dosage, but maybe I can... Guys? Guys? Thanks. That's twice now you've helped me. Yeah, I guess so. Do you feel that? It's hot. Yeah. No, I mean, it's really, really hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot. Oh, shoe. What the hell is that? It's some kind of altar. Altar? What is this, some kind of church? No denomination I know of. It's all carved out of stone. These are amazing. I've seen these before. Really? Yeah, when my daughter sends me a text message filled with emojis. - Funny. - Hm. Amazing how civilization has reached a point where it can communicate through cartoons. The people here, they worshiped the monster. Like some kind of deity. They brought it what they could, or they would suffer the consequences. Consequences? Yeah, look, it's pretty graphic. Oh, you're not kidding. Is that the queen? I'm not sure. But look, there's more. Eight acolytes surround the monster, creating some kind of larger force. Their power extends far beyond anything we could ever imagine. Hunter, I think I found their queen. That's not their queen. She's the sacrifice. Look. They fed their purest to the monster to keep it satisfied. Virgin sacrifice? Is there any other kind? Sure. Custody every other weekend and every third holiday. - Ouch. - Yeah. But it looks like she doesn't die after the ritual. After the sacrifice, she becomes... something more. Maybe she was a keeper. Good looks, smart, funny. You know, the total package. Yeah, well, she's been dead for a couple hundred years. I'm pretty sure her conversation skills would leave much to be desired. If six years of marriage taught me anything, it's that silence is golden. Fuck! Great, we've been walking around in circles. Well, that's just perfect. You're not helping, Declan. How do you want me to help, Annie? Maybe you can tell me how to move two billion tons of rock out of the way. Well, you are an expert in shovelling shit. Oh, and you would know? You know what, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you. You wouldn't be anywhere if it wasn't for me. You'd still be doing the weather. Oh, really? You know what, I am so sick and tired of- - You're sick and tired of me? - Can you fix it? No. It's done. But, uh, maybe I can build something else. You think so? Maybe. With a little time. Some luck. That's what I like to hear. I'm gonna need those goggles. - Yeah. - Thanks. This is all your fault! It's not my fault! Nothing's my fault, okay? "Look at me, I'm Declan. I'm off my pills." - Oh- - Hey, guys. - What?! - Kennedy thinks she might be able to construct something that'll get us out of here. Doubt it. Annie, I want you to stay with her. Okay. What do you need me to do? You and I are gonna keep searching for the others. Oh, fuck the others. That's their bad luck. I mean, those brave souls will be forever remembered and deeply mourned. Look, come here. Kennedy's plan might not work- - Oh, no shit. But we got to keep searching for the others. You and me. I mean, like heroes. That's got to be newsworthy, right? - Heroes, huh? - Well, maybe. If the cape fits. Declan Drummond. A man of his time. Sure. An icon of extraordinary physical prowess. I mean, that might be pushing it just a little bit, but- - Okay, shut up. I'm in. Great. Thanks, Declan. - Yeah. - You got this, yeah? Yeah. Let's go, hero. Ah, god. Guys, guys! I found my earring! Mwah. These are hundreds of years old. Maybe more. How did you guys not find this place? Um, Earth's pretty big. Lot of places to dig. We get to everything eventually, though. Oh. Flashlight? What are you doing? I am documenting. People are gonna want to know all about this. And it's, um, the only camera I have, so... How's your knee? Fall didn't help. Can I be honest with you for a sec? Yeah, sure. That was a stupid call, Hunter. Excuse me? The lava. That was an unnecessary risk. You could've died. But I didn't. And we would've never found this place if I hadn't. We could've died. What if I hadn't caught you? But you did. Yeah, but what if I dropped you? Or you dragged me down with you? Why are we talking about what could've happened? We made it out okay. Besides, it was your choice to reach out and catch me. You didn't have to. Of course I did. I wasn't gonna let you fall. My hero. Hey, I'm not gonna let you brush this off. I'm gonna tell you exactly what I think and, goddammit, you're gonna listen to me. - Can it wait? - It can wait. If you plan on making something that gets us out of here, I think you better hurry! Wow. You really just picked that up, didn't you? Carey, watch out! Hoo! Hoo! Hunter! Yep. Thanks. No problem. Is he dead? Emptied the clip. Didn't miss once. What the hell is that? Help me pick him up. She's always got to be touching something. - Lay him face down. - Yeah. What is that? I don't know. Is it actually attached to him? I don't know. - Hey, don't touch it. - I wasn't going to. I just want... It's breathing. Is it a parasite or something? Wait a minute. I've seen this guy before. What? When? Churchill's friends who died in the mine accident. Look at this. Right, except for this friend isn't dead. He hasn't aged. Much. Which makes this thing less of a parasite and more of a symbiont. Right. But he's under some kind of trance, or something. It might be telepathic. Or magic. But it's probably, uh, telepathic. What? What? Did you see something? It's what I don't see. Oh, where did he go? Okay, he-he was dead, right? Yeah, he was dead. Shit. What is that? Dr. Nicolai? Come on. Wait. What? He could be injured. Yeah, but how do you know you can trust him? He's Russian. He's a scientist. Yeah, the worst kind of Russians. Come on. Follow my lead. Follow... Oh, goddammit. I didn't know Hilly, but now I do. Ew. Whatever we're dealing with, it's more intelligent than a simple animal. It seems to have incredible strength and is very hard to kill. I'm Hunter Hazelton and this is Channel 8 News. Hunter! Come on! We can get him! What do you... What do you think you're doing? You saw what he's capable of. We can get him. He tried to kill us. Now, you want to chase him through a hole in the ground? Hunter! He is getting away! Yes! Yes, the pickaxe-wielding maniac with telepathic symbolism is getting away! This is a good thing. Hunter! Let go. This is what I do. I chase. Make me understand why I should just let you run off to your death. Because. Don't you feel it? Feel what? Life. At some point, everything starts to suck. Your parents get older and get sick. Dreams that you have had your entire life begin to fade, or disappear completely, replaced by whatever it is that you're capable of accepting. What does that have to do with anything? I want to feel that spark of magic, of possibility, of monsters and adventure. Don't you feel it right now? If you don't, don't you want to? I'm scared, Hunter. Exactly. You coming? Wait up. Oh, and it was telepathic symbiont. It was killing me not to correct you back there. What the hell is this? Oh, god. Oh, gross. This stuff is all over the place. Must be some kind of incubation chamber. Incubation chamber? Incubation chamber for what? Are these eggs? Yeah, they're eggs. Ahh! Fucking eggs! Jesus. Fuck. Uh, what was that? Uh, Cam? What is that? Where? - Right there. - Where? Right there. Um, you know karate, right? Why? Because I'm Asian? Well... Do you? Of course I know karate. Oh, god! Oh, oh! Oh, get it off! Get it off! Get it off! I can't! All right, stop! Stop, stop, stop, stop! Oh, oh, whoa. Whoa. Whoa, okay, um... It's okay. It's okay. I just... I think it's, uh... Oh. Okay, it's attached itself to my body. Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. Uh... Just be honest. How does it look? Uh. Declan, look. Belong. Declan, let's get outta here. Belong. Declan, easy. Declan, it's me. Easy. Easy. Fuck it. Oh, that felt a lot better than it should've. Shit. Belong. You're pretty good with a gun. Where'd you learn to shoot? My dad, mostly. Practiced at ranges. I usually carry all the time, except when I'm on assignments. Makes you feel safer? It's a really loud rape whistle. Hey, look! There's an opening up ahead. Carey. He killed himself. How long do you think he's been here? He's a knight in shining armor. How many of those are left? Well, maybe without the armor. Do you think that- - That this could lead us outta here? It's a worth a shot. Uh, how long can you hold your breath? I guess we're about to find out. Whoa! Did that just happen? - Football. - Oh. The list is long. Okay, um, just promise you'll come back. What's this? Do I sense a hint of symbiosis? See? I'm learning. You are just full of surprises. But, seriously, you should have that checked. Yeah. Carey, wait. Promise. I always break my promises, so I won't make any. Just wish me luck. That'll do. Flashlight? Bye. Good luck. There! What? I was able to scavenge enough material to assemble a portable structural atom pulverizer with rotating prism and recoil adjusting power compensator with a cushioned grip. What? I built an energy bomb. You know, click, throw, kaboom! You made a bomb? Yeah, an energy bomb to be more specific. I had to figure out how to harness some of the energy relay in order to make it. Wow. Great job. Good for you. Um, so can this get us out of here? There's only one way to find out. Hey, guys! Took you long enough. Kennedy thinks that she created a way to... Hey, what are you holding? Hunter. Hunter! Cam. Cam, help me. Please. Cam? Annie. Annie, you're not one of them. Shh. What do you think you're doing? Trying to blend in? Blend in? Help me. I'm sorry, that's not really the best decision for me to make for myself. Don't take it personally. I hope you can understand. You're not the one being tied to an altar. Are you comfortable? I can try to make it comfortable. Ugh. I bet you wear pink and change your social media picture every time the mob tells you to. There's nothing wrong with taking a stand. There are many issues worth standing up for, like bullying, for example. You are sacrificing me to an ancient god. I'm sorry? Shh! It's okay. It'll all be over soon. I never liked you. Oh, okay, I guess we're going now. Bye. Be tasty. Annie. Annie! Somebody help me! Hunter. Come and see. The past is the future. The future is the past. And so it goes over and over and over again. Give yourself to me. The life. He resists. Hunter. Hunter. Hunter. What are you? She will learn her desire is to belong. I want you to help me. This world, it will be mine once more. She can be trusted. - I won't help you. - I told you. You will help me. What is this? It's us. Do you remember this day? You looked at me with that smile and I thought I could change the world. I didn't change the world. I didn't change anything. You can still change the world, Hunter. You can help me do it. Together. Take my hand. Be my goddess. What? My little princess. Mine. No. This isn't real. You're speaking as him but you are not him. Hunter. Honey. I'm so proud of you. Isn't that what you want? Get out of my head. Baby girl. You belong to me. No. Get out of my head! Shh, shh, shh, shh. It's okay, it's okay. - You came back. - Yeah. Oh! You came back. I'm not sure where they went, but we got to go now. We can get out underwater. We can swim out of here. Okay. Carey, that thing, it communicated with me. I saw things. What things? Death. Destruction. An orgy. Okay, let's go. Orgy? Wait, tell me more about the orgy. Come on. It's a long swim, but I think we can make it. Carey, thanks again so much for coming back for me. Don't sweat it, I- - Carey! - It's got me! - Give me your hand. - Run! Carey! Hunter, come back to me. You belong to me. Cam, don't make me do this. Cam, please. Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hunter? Cam? I think it's letting go. Try and get it off me. Okay. Hey, Hunter. Hey, Cam. Some story, huh? Me without my camera. Listen, it knows everything that we do. Our deepest desires, our... our fears. And it wants out of this place. And you can't let it. It was in my mind, too. It showed me my father. Then you know... You know you have to finish this. You can't let that thing get outta here. I know, but how do I stop it? There's a weapon. Kennedy made it. It's at the cave-in site. It's an energy bomb, and it's our only hope at stopping it. I'll find it. Cam. It's okay. It's okay. I'm dying, Hunter. Don't leave me like this. You know what you have to do. I can't do it. Hunter, you are the strongest person I know. I love you, Cam. Mr. Hazelton, do you have any last words you'd like to share with us about your daughter? We don't want to talk to you. Last words? What the hell's wrong with you?! I'll tell you something. My daughter, Hunter, she's a survivor. She's gonna fight. She's gonna find her way out of that damn mine. And then you'll see. She's gonna make me and the whole country proud, just like she always does, 'cause my baby girl doesn't know the meaning of the word quit. Now get the fuck off my lawn, you goddamn parasite. Obviously, a tense situation. Next up, we go live to talk with the family of Russian scientist Alek Nicolai. Leave my friend alone. Who knew that would come in handy? Shh! What are you doing here? I escaped, I was looking for a way out. You have to help me. Help you? You tried to sacrifice me like, five minutes ago. I've changed? I've seen the error of my ways. Um. You're a good person? - Fuck you. - I deserve that. Fine, follow me, but keep your mouth shut. We need to find Carey and then we can escape through the back. There can only be only one queen of the world, Hunter Hazelton. And it was never gonna be you. Pick her up. Let's get this over with. Now! It's a slight improvement. Hunter. - Carey? - Are you okay? Yeah. Hm. They are yours to do with as you please, oh, great one. Annie, what are you doing? Oh, you're not the only smart one here, Hunter. I read the hieroglyphics, too. This thing needs a sacrifice to keep it in check. And by my count, I have two sacrifices right here. She's talking about us, right? When you rejected its offer, what did you think was gonna happen? That it would just stop because Hunter Hazelton said no? Of course it's not gonna stop. It found someone better. Someone more worthy of being its emissary. Me. Mm. Oh, great and powerful Octopus God, behold the gifts I have brought for thee. Annie, why? Why? Easy. One: Survival. Two: Queen of the fucking world. Three: Eternal youth. You know, I don't know how you turned all that down. Yeah, that last one is pretty cool. And on top of it all, I get an army of brainwashed slaves to control with the deal. Well, Declan was already halfway there, but you know what I mean. Annie, do you really think you can appease a giant monster? I guess we're about to find out. Hunter, look at me. Look at me. Don't be afraid. Annie, that is the second time you tried to sacrifice me today. Once you do it the first time, it is infinitely easier the second time around. You had your chance, Hunter, and like always, you just weren't good enough. We'll see. We'll see how smart your ancient deity really is. Do you know what this is? Hunter, what are you doing? You know what she knows. You do know this is bad news. Hunter, you're ruining everything. I've got this under control. You let me and my friend go, or I press this button and everything ends. Oh. Smart girl. Hunter, what are you doing? Exerting my dominance. Hopefully. Come on, let's go. No, wait. Where are you going? You can't leave. You can't leave here without me. Oh, no, no, I was just kidding. I would never leave you, baby. Please. We can't leave her like this. I know. You're welcome. Come on, let's go. Oh.
