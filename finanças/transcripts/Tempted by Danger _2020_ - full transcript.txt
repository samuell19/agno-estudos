Angela? All I'm saying is we can do this the easy way, or we can do this the hard way. We prefer to do it the easy way. I'd take the deal. It's a win-win. My client did nothing wrong. Therefore, we're not interested in your offer. Besides, it's crap. Your client scammed my client out of millions of dollars, and we can prove it. If you take this deal, we'll settle for half the money, and our client won't press charges. Yeah. That's not gonna happen. Guess we're doing this the hard way. This is an email from your client detailing the scam to his buddy, john. Could have been doctored. These are photos of your client meeting with his co-conspirator, alex, who, did I not mention this part? Is waiting in the office upstairs and has already agreed to plead guilty to all charges. And testify against your client. No bid deal. And finally, bank statements. $12 million to the cayman islands. Okay, okay, I get it. I'll take the deal. The deal? I'm sorry. The deal is no longer on the table. We did! Boom! You did it again, nicole. My padawan has become a jedi. I'm proud of you. Thanks, obi-wan! You were pretty great, too, for a wingman. Ooh! Ouch. Well, I'm gonna make sure glenn and the other partners know about your nailing this. Who knows, you might just be the youngest partner this firm has ever seen. Well thanks for always believing. Of course. See you. I'll see you, too. Nicole! I really didn't think we'd ever get that money back. Thank you. That's what we're here for. look, I know it's a long shot, but we're looking for in house counsel at the company. Of course we can't pay you what they do at the firm, but I can offer you stock, great benefits. I promise never to call you on a weekend. What do you think? I'm flattered, really, but my path is with the firm. Maybe talk to me in 10 years? It was worth a shot. Always. Good morning. - Good morning. Morning, padma. Morning, ange. Hey! The new strategist just popped by and is wondering if he can come in and say hi. Yes! Please, send him in. Hi! Hey. - Hello! Michael langdon. I wanted to introduce myself to you in person. I'm gonna be working with you on the new quencher campaign. I'm-I'm angela. It's a pleasure. Please, have a seat. You have a lovely office. Thank you. So, where did you come from? Well I'm originally from new orleans, but I assume you mean my last company I was at, creative arts lab. That's a great team. Why'd you leave? Well, I went to business school, stanford. Impressive! With such a great pedigree, why exactly did you decide to come back to advertising? well, I-I love it. It's creative, strategic. The people are fun. I want to start my own firm one day. Well, I will definitely enjoy working with you until you do. If you have any questions, don't be a stranger. I won't. Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you. And, congratulations. Thank you. What did I tell you? Ooh, if I wasn't married. Partner? My goodness, nicole, that is incredible! Nice! Well, okay, let's not get our hopes up. It may not even be a reality yet. My little sister, the big fancy lawyer. Now we just need to find you a suitable husband. Don't even go there! What? Dating is normal. Not dating is not normal. When is the last time you've been out with a man or even out with your friends? I'm here, aren't I? Yes, and you are so amazing with ryan. Don't you want kids of your own someday? I get it, you're focused on your career, and I am in awe of how hard you work, but- I'm proof you can have it all. You've been out of the game for 10 years. You have no idea what it's like out there. These apps, angela. there's guys without shirts sending disgusting photos, selling teeth whitener on instagram. Wow. Believe me, being single's a blessing. You just need to find someone who's on your level. Maybe. You need someone who isn't gonna be intimidated by your ambition. And the pickings are indeed slim. I think I have found the perfect guy for you. No, what have you done? Nothing yet. I cannot believe you convinced me to come here. What? You love art. Besides, you are gonna thank me on your wedding day. Although, I did kinda have to tell him it was a work thing to get him to come. So he doesn't know he's being set up? Or that I'm not his co-worker? Not exactly. I'm sorry. I-I cannot believe I left work early for this. Listen, I swear I don't know where everybody is. I said we were meeting at eight o'clock. I must have gotten it wrong. Baby brain. But listen, michael, have you met nicole? Nicole, michael. Rick, come over here with me. I want to show you this artist that I'm dying to hire. Really, angela? All right. Well, it's nice to meet you. So? What do you think of michael? He's fine, I guess. But he was kinda rude to the bartender. Yeah, he didn't leave a tip. Maybe he was just short on change. For a guy who wears a rolex, he seems kinda insecure. You did not get 1600 on your sat! I don't know what to tell you, but I did. That is almost statistically impossible. And yet it is statistically possible. I know that because I did that. What'd you get, 1590? No. - You got 1590, didn't you? See, I beat you by 10 points, and you're mad. Look at you. - No, I'm not. You're competitive? I'm not competitive. Okay, I'm a little competitive. I can see it. But, actually, I'm impressed. I don't really meet guys who are as driven as I am. Well I don't meet women who are as driven as I am. Would you say that we're equally driven? Or that I'm more or less driven than you are? Probably more, right? It's close. It's as close as 1590 is to 1600. How 'bout I call you sometime? Take you out on a real date? I think I'd like that. You sure? - Yeah. - Okay, good. chai tea latte half syrup with almond milk. Just the way you like it. What are you doing here? I thought you had a thing. Wait. You're beaming. Did you get a new job? No. But I did meet someone. Wow! Miss independent met a guy! And who, pray tell, has managed to meet your extremely rigid and impossibly high standards? It's early. I don't want to jinx it so I'm just gonna say he's a handsome stanford mba who works with my sister. Really? Well I won't believe he's real until I meet him in person. But I am glad you're here, because I also have some exciting news. Ooh, did kyle jr. Pass his muay thai test? No, he got kicked in the head. But, I did talk with glenn. He was really impressed with your last outcome, and if you land capital ventures as a client, I bet he makes you partner. You're joking. No pressure. We just have to ace the pitch dinner with them. My god. My god, my god, my god! You didn't- you didn't hear that from me. Maybe my sister was right. Maybe I can have it all. hey, angela, you got a minute? Hey, michael! Of course! What's up? I got that brief for the quencher account. Thought you might want to take a look at it. Quencher? That pitch is months away. Too eager? I'm sorry, I get a little obsessive when I got an idea. I can come back in a few weeks if you want. No. No, no, no worries. I like you taking the initiative, so let's see what you got. Here you go. Okay, let's see. So- thank you. All right. Now, quencher's really trying to reach generation z with this next campaign. Now unlike millennials, these kids are very cognizant of the detrimental effects their cellphones and social media is having on them. They make a concerted effort to carve out time for person to person interaction. Okay, so we do a campaign about friends sharing a quencher. No phones, no screen time, just good old-fashioned conversation. It's old school. I like it. I think it's the way to go. Okay. Well, I'll have the design team work on the mock ups, and as soon as they're ready, padma will call your assistant and let you know. I'm actually still interviewing for that position. You think you can have padma reach out to me directly. Will do. Okay. Is that a picture of you and nicole? Yeah! You guys always been so close? Yeah, we have. She has always been taller than me even though I'm the big sister. She's really, really protective. I think it's sweet the way you two look out for each other. Yes, it is. So, don't you screw it up. Noted. though I have no intentions of that happening. Good. All right, I'm gonna get outta here. I got a meeting. Okay, thank you, micheal. - No problem. Is that one of our spokesmodels? no, that was michael, our new strategist. Wow. I can't keep track of them all. Turnover's so high. Got a minute? - Absolutely, come on in. nicole brooks. Answering your phone on a weekday. I didn't think you had it in you. Well, you never know when a client might be calling. True. That is true. So, um- as I promised, how do you feel about going out on a proper dinner date? What if I told you I had a better idea? All right, I'm listening. now this I did not expect out of you. I'm still getting past the fact that you're an actual gun owner. Is that weird? 'cause shooting helps me relieve stress. Please don't think I'm crazy. No, no, no, you're not crazy. - It's not weird. - No? I'm actually a little turned on by it. Okay, well let's see if you can return the favour. I can return the favour. I am a favour returner. You ready? - Mmhm. that's embarrassing. At least you hit the target. You're loving this, ain't you? Being the best? A little. - Yeah. All right, watch this. Hold on. Okay. Man, I'm only getting worse. It's okay. - I think it's the gun. I don't know. But it's okay, I still like you. I like you too. Do you like food? Do you like to eat? Of course. I got reservations at beast Friday night. Come with me. Beast? Isn't that michelin starred? How'd you manage that? Well I might not be good with a gun, but I got other skills. okay, I see you. I wouldn't miss it. Good. Excuse me. Want the scorecard? Ooh! I think that's my first bullseye. Um, hello? No, this is not your first bullseye. I got the 10. Okay, so, we need to convince these execs that their current firm is blowing it by playing it safe. That's why they're losing. They need to be more aggressive. That's my specialty. That's what I'm counting on. By the way, they moved the dinner up to tomorrow night. Great! Wait, shoot. What's up? I made plans with michael. But it's fine, he'll understand. Sorry. I had to cancel plans too, with my wife's best friend and her husband. Darn. It-it's fine. This is more important obviously. Kinda and your partnership may be riding on it. Exactly. it looks great. I mean, it's good. But the logo. Can we use a font that's a little bit more youthful? You know, make it pop. This is the new generation. We want that to come through. I'm not mad at that. I'll definitely give the design team that note. So, on another note, how are things going with nicole? Really well. Your sister's one in a million. She's full of surprises. For sure. She hasn't made you meet her for one of those early morning breakfasts that she loves? No, not yet. But I'm an early riser, so that works for me. No thank you! I believe in sleep! You know, she's a workout fanatic. She gets up at like 4:30, 5:00 to workout. She says, "a fit brain is a smart brain, angie." well that's not so bad. I mean, if you wake up, roll out of bed and workout and home. No. She goes down to that health club zenith downtown. I'm just so happy that I'm pregnant so she cannot drag me along with her. Okay, well, um- I'm gonna- I'm gonna get outta your hair. Why don't you relax, kick your feet up and, um- why don't you put some heat on that back of yours. Another great idea. Thank you, michael! hey, cutie. I just left a meeting with your sister. It's obvious brains run in your family. And don't you forget it. I hope you're working up an appetite. I can't wait for our date tomorrow night. About that- I'm going to have to cancel it because my very important new client meeting got moved to tomorrow night. Michael? Are you there? I am so sorry! I was so looking forward to seeing you and the food. Can I take a rain check? Listen, I'm not gonna say I'm not disappointed. Do you have any idea how difficult it is to get reservations at beast on a Friday night? But, I guess with you I'm learning that work comes first. Well in this case yes, but I still feel awful bailing on you. What about the weekend? You know what, why don't we play it by ear. I'll let you know when I'm free. Good luck tomorrow night. what was that? You blew him off? He wasn't angry, but it was uncomfortable. My goodness. Work will always come first for me, beast or no beast. Why'd you? He-he was taking you to the beast? Are you serious? Damn, I would've been pissed at you too. Do you know it is impossible to get reservations there? So you're taking his side now? We went on two dates. Be my sister. I am your sister. I am team nicole. I'm just saying, I would feel some kinda way too if a guy always blew me off for work. What is this "always" stuff? With you it's always always. And at some point you are going to have to find balance. I mean, no matter who you're dating. Well, there may be nothing to balance. I'm pretty sure I might have blown it. No, really? Yeah, he seemed fairly non-committal after I cancelled. It was weird. But- I barely know him, so maybe it's for the best. He's just such a nice guy. I mean, have you checked his social media? Do you guys have any mutual friends? Ange? You know I hate doing that. I pry enough into my client's lives at work. I need to trust my instincts in my personal life. Okay. And don't you even dare! fine. But do you remember how horrible my first date was with rick? Crazy! And do you remember who encouraged me to give him another chance. Okay. Yes, you. And it was the best decision that I've ever made. All I'm saying is why not give him another chance? Do something nice for him. Make him feel like he matters. All right. yay! I'll think about it. Right after I've landed this partnership. Okay. Mmhm. - Okay. Michael? Nicole. What are you doing downtown? I thought you lived in whittier. Well I have a meeting with a client early this morning, and I had a couple passes to this gym, so I decided to come by for a workout. What do they say? "a fit brain brain is a"- "smart one"? - Yeah. Yeah, so very true. All right, well it's good to see you. I'm gonna get back to this workout. Okay. Hey, michael? Mmhm? Um- I'm really sorry about flaking on tonight. My client's dinner is at nique, which is right beside my favourite bar. Maybe we can grab a drink? I'll either be celebrating or drowning my sorrows. Yeah, I'd love that. And I'm sorry about the way I acted. I, I was just really looking forward to spending time with you and the food. Well, I hate to leave, but I can't be late for this meeting. Yeah. - Yeah. I'll text you later about tonight? All right, can't wait. And, good luck on your dinner. Knock 'em dead. Thanks. Hey! Hey there! Look at you! Good to see you too. Some vino. Thank you. Cheers. Hey hot stuff! Hey, there she is. - Hey. How did it go? We killed it. They loved our take no prisoners trial strategy, and they're already sending over the paperwork. All right, well let's have a couple of drinks to celebrate. Here you go, guys. - Okay. These look deadly. Manhattan. Here's to nicole, for being a legal badass. And here's to you, michael, for ordering us these delicious drinks. I feel like I'm so overdressed. No, you look good. You're like a single accessory away from being an absolute masterpiece. Thank you. Um, well in that case- let me just add a little something. What do you think? I think you're beautiful. Thank you. It's vintage hermes. I bought it with my first paycheck at the firm. It's one of my most treasured possessions. Well you definitely have exquisite taste. Thank you. You want to get a table? Yeah, let's do it. - Okay. So what was the guy like? What guy? The guy that you were out for dinner with. Why would you assume that the client was a man? I'll have you know our new high stakes clients are women. maybe you're right. Maybe I shouldn't assume. No, you shouldn't. Well, there is one guy. Okay. Yeah, who's that? His name is kyle. He's my work husband and he's great. He's so great. Your work husband? Yeah. Oops, that went quickly. Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have had a drink before dinner. How'd you know I had a drink before dinner? You know. Clients are never on time. It's so true. It's so true. Are you with me right now? - Yeah I am. I'm good. How many fingers? I'm gonna have to get you home. I'm good. You really can hold your liquor. Yeah. Yeah, I can. Okay. Of course I'm fine. - All right, just checking. well. This is you? Yeah. It's cute. Let me get that. Well, thank you for escorting me home. Of course. I'm a gentleman. I hope not too much of a gentleman. what are you saying? Watch your step. Yup. someone's had a weekend. Life is just really beautiful sometimes, you know? sure. Unless your dog decides to get into a midnight rumble with a skunk. That's tragic. Mmhm. So why's your life so beautiful? I spent the entire weekend with michael. I think we're on our way to becoming a couple. Officially. Congratulations. Look at you. Abandoning your work husband, falling into lust, making partner. You really do have it all going on, don't you? Making partner? What did you hear? Let's just say the company's throwing an impromptu party tonight to celebrate the new contract you just won them. You might want to be there because there might be an announcement. And you know what? You should bring, um- your official guy. I'm sure everyone would love to meet him. His name is michael. Michael. And maybe I will. Wow. Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. I love being so ahead of the game. You know, your laser focus is rubbing off on me. I will definitely run this up the chain. Maybe since we're so far ahead we should just wait for the official campaign dates. Don't you want to show people what you're capable of? Yeah, of course. Yeah, no, you're right, you're right. So? How was your weekend? It was good. Your sister is some kind of lady. I love new love! It's just so magical and full of hope and excitement. Everything okay with you and rick? Yeah, we're good. Just being nostalgic. You know, things get hectic when you have kids. That's what I hear. - Yeah. What does rick do exactly? He's a stay at home dad, and he's developing an app. Wow. - Mmhmm. Stay at home dad. I'd be worried about rick and those stay at home moms. No, no, no. That's not rick's style. Well if you ever are concerned, you can always check his cell phone's locations history. What? Yeah. Check this out. Just punch it into somebody's phone or their computer. The map on his phone is linked to his email accounts. It's honestly a little creepy and invasive. It's not a breach of trust. It's just a new way to keep track of your loved ones. - Know what I mean? - Really? Okay. Well, I'll keep that in mind. Thank you. - It's the future. Um- yeah, I'm late. I gotta meet your sister for lunch. I gotta get outta here. - Well you guys have fun. - Okay. I haven't done this since high school. Have you always been such a hopeless romantic? I think I'm just inspired. Come to my cabin. You have a cabin? Yeah. Yeah, it's nothing fancy, but it's- it's super private. It's a little bit rustic. I'm down with rustic. - Okay. Want to get on the jungle gym? Yeah, let's do it. I'll race you there! You know, I had this weird moment with michael today at work. Mixing too much business with family? No, no. He-he pulled out his cellphone and showed me this weird location tracker thing. So, did you know that if you're logged into someone's email you can track their every move? Yeah, it's pretty much common practice in modern relationships I'm afraid. Really? Yeah. That just sounds creepy to me. I'm so happy that I'm not dating. Do you think he's using it? I hope not. You think I should tell nicole? I think that your sister finally has a good thing going. And michael was probably just trying to impress you. I wouldn't read too much into this. So- you just think I'm, um, being- overprotective? Overprotective. Now can we please stop talking about michael? Yes. May I have your attention, please? To nicole brooks, youngest lawyer ever to make partner at royston, carter, and klein. Congratulations. To nicole! To nicole! Thank you. Woooo! thank you. Nicole? - Thank you so much. Cheers. - Cheers. Congrats. So- you must be nicole's guy. It's so nice to meet you. I'm lisa. Nice to meet you too, lisa. You must be something special to catch nicole's eye. she has the toughest standards imaginable. Did you know she once created a riddle? Okay, I couldn't even begin to tell you how to solve it, but in order for anyone to go out with her, they had to solve this riddle. And it was amazing because she knew no one would solve it, you know, except that one special someone. Did she make you solve the riddle? Michael? Michael! Yeah. What? Are you sure we haven't met before? You look so familiar to me. Um, I don't think so. I think I just have one of those faces, you know? Yeah. You do have one of those faces. Yeah. You know what? You look just like my friend's sister's boyfriend. That's crazy. Yeah. But you know, he's a little bit taller than you. That's the only difference. - Okay. - That's the only difference. But you know- -sounds like a good guy. You shouldn't be nervous tonight. Hi, michael! Um, this is my work husband, kyle. Hey. We spend way too much time together. Yeah, just ask my other wife. That's funny, that's a good one. Um, you wanna get outta here? What? It's only 8:00. Can we stay for a little bit? Yeah it's her big night after all. It- yeah, no, I-I know. I'm just not feeling, feeling good at all. No, are you okay? I think it was something in the crab cakes. Um- Ooh. I don't know. You know what? You stay, I'm gonna go, okay? No, no, no, no. I'll go too. I should probably quit while I'm ahead anyway now that I'm partner. um, but we're gonna take off. Okay, yeah. - Okay? Bye. - See you tomorrow. Hey, congratulations, partner. Thank you. Thank you so much. I'll see you around. - Yeah, nice to meet you. man, I thought life would get easier after making partner, but it's just work on top of work. Which never ends and only gets worse and then you die. But at least we'll die together. I don't know how you juggle this with a family. Me either. So? What did you think of michael? Pretty great, right? Yeah, yeah, yeah. He seems great. It's too bad you guys had to leave early. How's he feeling? Fine. Turns out it was a false alarm. Really? Yeah. One down, another to go. What does e-bank want? Campaign for savings. What's the deal with kyle? Kyle? Yeah, nicole's work husband. What's his deal? You know, they absolutely enjoy working together. The feeling's mutual. But I was thinking, what if- how long have they been working together? Well, since nicole started working there. But I'm pretty sure he's happily married. Pretty sure? Okay, honestly, look, I don't know him like that. However, he's been amazing to nicole. What are we gonna do for e-bank? Right, yeah. I-I came here to tell you that I'm revising the brief right now. I'll come back when it's ready. Okay. Hey. Do you remember that photo that I had over there? Yeah, it was cute. Um, I haven't been able to find it. Have you seen it? No, I haven't but I'll keep an eye out for it. Okay. Thank you. No problem. Hey, padma. Hey, rod! How you doin', man? Hey, michael! How's it going, man? - Good! - Nice to see you. Good to see you. You didn't have to. You're not that good. hey, did you catch the game tonight? Disaster. Brutal! But don't worry, they're gonna turn it around. Trust me, I got a feeling. I hope you're okay, man. Have a good night. Take care. Hello! - Hello. Hi. These are for you. Thank you. That's so sweet. Come in, come in. That was incredible. I can't believe you did all this for me. Well, I thought tonight should be special. Yeah? I got you something. What'd you get me? I'm a little nervous. Open it. You're giving me a key? Well, a drawer couldn't fit in the box, so- wow. I hope I'm not being too presumptuous. Is it too soon? No, no, no, no, no, no. It's perfect. And I want to give you one too. As soon as my renos are done, you got a key. More wine? Please. I have to be honest. There is another reason why I wanted tonight to be perfect. And why is that? Because I can't make it to the cabin this weekend. What? I'm so sorry. It's just becoming a partner is way more intense than I thought it would be and I'm so bogged down. It's just for two days. I mean- you need to get away, I need to get away. I know, but I'm really overwhelmed. We have a huge meeting with the clients on Monday, and the trial's next week. Okay. Well, why don't you bring your work to the cabin, and you can work on it there. Well unfortunately we have a lot of preparing to do, and I need to be in the office. We? who "we"? Me and kyle. Okay. Yeah, I understand. It's a very exciting week for you. I get it. You sure you're okay with this? Yeah. Okay. Thanks. yeah. Here. I should be really happy right now. I made partner, I have a gorgeous, successful boyfriend who somewhat supports my career. So why am I still feeling like something's missing? Because life isn't a fairy tale, and we can both agree that you strive for perfection. I know, but something was off about michael last night. I just can't put my finger on it. He was excited about the key- The key? Ho! Wow! Aren't we moving fast? Maybe. You know, I've never seen his place? He always has some excuse to come to mine. Is that weird? Well, I mean most guys would rather sleep on their girlfriend's clean sheets. You know, he kinda shut down when I put off our weekend away because kyle and I needed to focus on the trial. You don't think he's jealous of kyle do you? He did ask me how long the two of you have been working together. But listen, nicole. You are going to have to get out of your own way if you want to make room for love in your life. Maybe this is just your way of finding fault to convince yourself. I just have more work to do now than ever. If I'm a partner I need to be concentrating on that. If I'm unsure about michael at all, he's just a distraction at this point. A very good looking distraction, but- yeah. Maybe I should put on the brakes. Well, work is definitely gonna be awkward, but, you know, listen, whatever you decide, I will support you. I'll shift him over to another creator director. he was becoming my secret weapon. And I was enjoying the view. I gotta admit, it was fun. But I really think I should tell him how I'm feeling. Well, just let me know how it goes. Hey, michael. Hey, babe, I was just wrapping things up. How's it going? Um, busy. And just about to have some dinner. Okay, you got enough for two? Um- yeah, listen michael. I don't know how to say this but I think maybe we need to slow things down. What'd you say? Just take a break. I just have a lot going on at work right now, and this trial is so consuming. I still have so much to prove, you know? Youngest partner ever, it's a lot of pressure. So you think I'm holding you back? No, not at all. I just, I can't make you a priority right now. And you deserve that. Is this about the key? What? No! Although I do think I jumped the gun on that. Yeah, no, don't worry, I'm a give it back to you. So, what, this is about kyle then? Kyle? Are you serious? You know, I knew there was something going on with you two. Okay, first of all, kyle is like a brother to me, so to insinuate otherwise is crazy. Where is this coming from? Like, I'm sorry, but you are completely out of line and- okay, well that went well. hey, ben, do you have a minute? Yeah, of course, angela. What's up? Okay. So, I was wondering if you could maybe rearrange the teams a little bit and move michael to a different cd. Who's michael again? Michael, he, um, is the new strategist, the one you thought looked like a model, - all handsome. - Right! Yeah. - Is there a problem? No, no, no, no, no, no. There isn't a problem. He's actually great. Um, it's more of a personal thing, a conflict of interest. I kinda introduced him to my sister and say no more. I'll talk to steph, see what she can do. Thank you. And I'm so appreciative. And I promise I'm not trying to be difficult. Hey, you've more than earned the right to be difficult, angela. Thank you. Okay, so this proves they went into the deal with the intent to defraud our clients. Exactly. We hammer them on that. They'll be boxed in. Okay, I- I like that. Good. Hey. We're gonna do great. I know, I'm just feeling a little out of my depth with this trial work. Listen, glenn wouldn't have put you on this if he didn't think you were up for it. Besides, no one's gonna be looking at anyone but the handsome first chair. yeah. You know what, we should take lunch. I gotta meet my wife. Do you want to come with? You can call michael and make it a foursome? Actually, we're on a break. Really? Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just need to focus on this. Okay, well in that case, we'll celebrate tomorrow after I dazzle everyone with our opening statements. I'm gonna hold you to that. Give my love to cindy. Always do. Hey, babe! How's your day? Um, padma could you come here for a moment please? What up, boss? Michael doesn't know this yet, but I've asked ben to move him off of my campaigns if possible. Can I ask why? Nicole is having some reservations, so she's decided to put the brakes on things. I felt it was prudent to separate business and personal. I always knew he was too good looking to be true. Anyway, can you please, um, call his assistant and reschedule the meeting we were supposed to have for tomorrow? Sure but he doesn't even have an assistant yet. I'm still scheduling through him. Seriously? What's his extension? He's still using his cellphone, apparently some mixup with it. Okay. Well, please schedule with him however you can. Will do boss. Yeah, well, no, I ordered a part, it's a water pump, could take a week, maybe two. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, I'll, I'll give you a call back, all right? Yeah, bye. - Hey. - Hey, lookin' to get an oil change. Yeah, sure. I'm gonna probably need to keep it overnight. Any chance I can get a loaner? Yeah, sure. Licence, please. Yeah. thank you. All right. Just sign here. Do you have keys? - Yeah. - Yeah. All right, william, you're all set with a loaner. It's the grey one out there. Just return it by noon tomorrow. All right. Thanks, buddy. Yeah. I'm certain that you will agree that $10 million is a fair and accurate compensation. Thank you. Perfection. You make it seem so effortless. well, I need my beauty sleep, and I think we've done all we can do tonight. Music to my ears. I'll meet you at quarter to eight, right? You're taking that with you? Yeah, I just want to take a final look at everything again. Of course you are. Promise me you'll get some rest. I promise. Shoot. I just remembered I promised glenn I'd send him a brief on the bowman account. Are you serious? Go on, get outta here. But I can wait. No, no, absolutely not. It-it may take a while. I just may not be glowing tomorrow. Okay, if you insist. I'll see you bright and early. Good night. Good night. what happened? My god! Kyle, you're awake! Where's cindy? she's taking the kids to your sister's. She'll be back soon. Why do I feel like I've been t-boned by a train? It was a hit and run in our parking garage. We don't know much else, because someone tampered with the security cameras. Was somebody waiting for me? I don't know, but maybe this has to do with the trial? God, the trial. Yeah, they pushed it to tomorrow. Yeah, I'm no doctor, but something tells me I'm not gonna by 100% by then. One day is all the judge would give us, even with glenn's influence. You'll have to take over. I'm too green with trial. They pulled in beth. You know this case inside out. Beth isn't gonna be able to learn it in time for opening. It needs to be you. You know that. I'm gonna go get the nurse. Dr. Bruce, telephone please. Dr. Bruce, telephone please. Hey, nicole! How you doin'? Michael? What are you doing here? I heard about kyle. How did you even hear about that? I brought flowers. Thanks. I'll go give them to kyle. No no, they're not for him, they're for you. Michael- - listen. I'm sorry I was a jerk about the cabin thing. I'm sorry I was a jerk about kyle. Just forgive me. I'll make it up to you, all right? Do you not understand the seriousness of what's going on here? Yeah, that's why I got you flowers. How can you not see how inappropriate this is? Kyle almost died and you're at the hospital trying to win me back? How can you be so smart and so stupid? I don't want these. I don't want us. You and me, we're not a thing. So please just go home! hey, honey, how are you? How's kyle? He woke up, thank god. I'm headed to work shortly. I can't believe I have to keep going with this trial. I'm not sure I can do this. That's understandable. Have you even slept? And I'm concerned about you if someone targeted kyle. You mean is there a maniac on the loose trying to affect the outcome of the trial? Don't worry about me. Glenn's hiring security just in case. that's a relief. Speaking of crazy, guess who showed up at the hospital. Who? Michael. What? How? It was creepy actually. How did I miss this? It's like he won't take no for an answer. Okay. Okay, you know what, that is not okay. Do you want me to talk to him? 'cause I will hammer home the point. No, it's okay. I don't want to make things weird for you at work. It's the least I can do. I helped get you in this mess. I have to help get you out. Okay, thanks. Um, I gotta go. Love you, bye. - Bye. Are you sure you can handle opening statements, nicole? The clients are counting on us. Yes, 100%, I got it. I know I'm going out on a limb, but, you've never let me down before. Besides that'll give beth time to get up to speed on the case. I know it's not ideal but- do you have the casework? Got it. Great. I'll let you two get at it. Hi. Where do you think we should start? Which section have you been working on so far? Hey, angela, you wanted to see me? Michael, come on in, sit down. So, I just wanted to check on you with everything going on. I'm really sorry that you and nicole didn't work out. Are you okay? I'm okay, thanks for asking. She tell you I went to the hospital? She did. And that was probably not the right time for a romantic gesture. You know, I don't know what I did wrong. You know, I just wanted to let her know that I was always thinking about her, that I was there for her. Right now, nicole just needs to focus on her career, and she doesn't have time for anything or anyone else. Do you get that? Yeah, of course, sure. Yeah. Don't you think you deserve someone who has more time for you? Yes, I do. nicole is just the type of girl that is married to her career and there's nothing that you or I can say or do to change that. Thank you, angela. That's really helpful. Yeah. Hey. I just wanted to remind you of your 11:00 a.M. Conference call. I'm so sorry. I have to take that. No, that's fine. I have a meeting downtown anyway. Thank you again. I really appreciate it. No problem. You know you don't really have a conference call, right? I know. Thank you. What did you say his last job was again? Um, creative arts lab. Okay. I'm glad that's done. And that is why you'll see that $10 million is a fair and accurate compensation. Thank you. You have done it a million times. Trust me, nicole, you're gonna be great. Maybe I should run it again, add back in that part about gross compensation? Maybe you should get some sleep. Have you slept at all since kyle's accident? No, not really. Come on. Let's get outta here. If you say so. Can you drive her please? She's borderline delirious. Hey, do you want me to take the brief? I got it, really. I just want to review it one more time. Thanks, beth. See you tomorrow. Goodnight. Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Okay, have a good night. Thank you so much. I'll see you tomorrow. Michael? thank god. Man, you had me scared there for a minute. I scared you? You scared me! Sorry, I was trying to be quiet. I know it's late. But what are you doing here? I thought you and nicole broke up? Yeah, yeah. We did. I'm just here to pick up a few things. She's working all hours of the night ever since she became partner, you know? Isn't that the truth. Nice seeing you, man. Take care. Yeah, you too. What? My god, my god. No. My god. hi! Um- when I got out of my car last night, did I leave the brief in there? No- okay, are you sure it's not in the car? Okay. Okay, thanks. No, no, no, no, no. Breathe. Why is this happening to me? My god. My god. Hey, padma. - Hey. Just dropping these files off for angela before heading uptown. Okay, I'll make sure she gets them. Okay. Do you need me to validate your parking? my car's in the shop. I rideshared here today. But thank you. All right. All right, take care. It's almost done. Hey, do you guys, buy cars too? Yeah, sometimes. Why, you want to sell the beamer? Well what can I get for it? It's a couple years old. I could give you 20 grand for it. 20 grand, cash? Cash is king. She's all yours. It's all there. Thanks, buddy. What do you mean you can't find it? I'm sorry. I was tired. I don't know, I must have left it somewhere. What about the security guy's car? I saw you get in the car with it. I called. He couldn't find it. Does kyle have the backup files? Of course! But wouldn't we have to reveal the security breach? Read the opposing counsel's disclosure documents? That's right. If we can't locate the brief, then we have to inform the judge, and if the judge doesn't dismiss the case outright and the defendants don't waive time, we have no choice but to move forward. You've left me no choice. Beth, starting tomorrow you'll take over the case. Get onto kyle's computer and get everything you can off the server. And as far as the disclosure docs are concerned, you're gonna have to wing it. You're pulling me from the case? I'm firing you, nicole. We'll be lucky if our reputation survives this! he Fired you? I almost died yesterday. That's cold. Well I pretty much torpedoed the case. And the company, so- who knows, you might be out of a job soon too. Well I didn't really like that job anyway. god. Come on- whiskey? What is this? Really? I'm unemployed now. My god, I'm unemployed now! Hey, hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, come on. Hey, come on, it's okay. I'm sure he's just panicking. Ten bucks says he calls you tomorrow and begs you to come back. Come on, look at me. You gonna share some of that whiskey? only a little. Yeah, there we go. With the meds and all. just a little bit. Just give me a little more. Come on, what are you, my mother? Come on. You're gonna get me in trouble. More. I might as well just give you the rest. I got fired, angela. They let me go. What? What happened? I messed up and lost the trial brief. This is so humiliating. What am I gonna do? Sweetie, I am so, so sorry. Where are you? Do you need to come over here? No, it's okay. I'm at the hospital with kyle. I'm just gonna stay here until I have to pack up my stuff tomorrow. I can come get you right now. No, I'm fine. Unless, of course, michael shows up again with more flowers. Listen, don't joke about that, okay? Rick says you need to talk to your neighbour rod and tell him that michael is not welcome there anymore. We need as many sets of eyes on you as possible. Angela, do you really think he's that unstable? I mean, yeah, the whole flower thing was a bit crazy, but I can't imagine him wanting to hurt anyone. I just think he can't handle rejection. Honestly, listen. Michael is about two seconds off of boiling bunnies in your kitchen, okay? So can you please talk to rod? Just for my piece of mind. If it will make you feel better I will. Keep your head up high at the office tomorrow. Call me if you need me. And listen, things are gonna sort themselves out, okay? Don't worry. I hope so. Love you. Love you. hey. What did you do to nicole? So I guess you heard what happened. For what it's worth, I think it's totally b.S. That they're firing you, especially considering the circumstances with kyle and everything. Thanks, lisa. So what are you gonna do next? You know, it's been a really long time since I have not had a plan. I think I'm gonna take some time and think about life. Well, if you need a character reference, just let me know. I appreciate that, thanks. I remembered why your boyfriend looked so familiar to me. Ex-boyfriend, but why? He looked just like this guy my friend used to date, but that guy's name was todd. Your guy's definitely michael, right? Yeah, michael. Thank god, because my friend had to get a restraining order from this guy. He started stalking her, showing up everywhere. It was crazy. That sounds horrifying. Yeah. Those guys could be twins though. Anyway, take care. Good luck with everything. Don't be a stranger. Yeah. Hey, nicole. Jesus! Michael! I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to scare you. What are you doing here? Are you following me? No, no. I just- I just came by to give you this. What is this? I thought I was clear we're not getting back together. Yeah, that's your-your key, the key you gave me. I'm giving it back to you. Michael, I'm so sorry. I just- I've been exhausted and things have been, well, kinda crazy. I appreciate you returning this. Thank you. Yeah. You know, I just wanted to do something nice for you since you lost your job. Wait, how do you even know about that? Yeah, um- My god! You know, I've been trying to give you the benefit of the doubt. I've even been defending you. But ange was right, you're a creep! And you need to stop following me and leave me alone! Angela said I was a creep? Yes and she's right! Now just leave me alone, please! All right. sorry, but nobody named michael langdon ever worked here. Are you sure? Tall, killer smile, looks like a supermodel? I think you're talking about todd langdon, but we had to fire him after he stalked one of our assistants. Even broke into her apartment. Why would our company even hire someone like that? Well, if it's todd, I'd be checking to see if they did. Okay, thanks. Padma. I'm looking for angela. Do you know where I might find her? I think she went home because of a babysitting emergency. Well, would you let her know that this new strategist, michael, that she asked about transferring, I have no idea who she's talking about and he's not on the payroll. Are you sure? Yeah. Tell her to give me a call when she can, and we'll get to the bottom of this. Thanks. Hey, nicole. Hey, rod. you got a minute? Yeah, sure. What's up? Are you okay? This is gonna sound a little crazy, but you know michael, my ex? Yeah, yeah, of course. He seemed like a pretty cool guy. I'm sorry it didn't work out. Well, actually, he's having a hard time getting over the breakup. And honestly, he's freaking me out a little bit. Can you just keep an eye out for me around here? Yikes, absolutely, yeah, of course. Thanks. I appreciate it. And I'm getting these locks changed first thing tomorrow. He got his stuff okay the other night, right? what do you mean? Well the night before last, when you were working late, he was here picking up some things. Okay. Michael. Todd langdon. My god. come on, angela. Pick up. pick up. Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up. padma. What's up? Is everything okay? No, rick, michael's not who he says he is! I have a very bad feeling! You need to be with angela right now! Just tell her to stay at the office til I get there. She got your email, she already left! What? What email? The email you sent saying your mom was sick. No, padma, I never sent an email! I'm gonna call the police! come on, pick up. Come on. Come on, angela. Answer the damn phone! Come on. come on. Come on. hey, nicole. How's it going? Why are you answering my sister's phone? Let me speak to angela right now! I believe she's indisposed at the moment, but if you want to see your sister alive, you'll get in your car and you'll come join us. No police or she's dead, you got it? Please do not hurt her. I'll do whatever you ask. This is between you and me. I'll text you the coordinates. Damn it! God! angela? Mom? Over here, dear. Is angela with you? No, she's not home from work yet. Lock the door and don't open it until I get back. - What do you mean? - Just lock the door! Hello? angela? what did you do to her? Relax. She's alive. What did you give her? She's pregnant! That's the least of her worries right now. What is this place? Do you live here? Yeah, it's a bit of a fixer upper. I like to call it my cabin in the city. You would know that if you made time for us. Why did you bring us here? What are you gonna do? I'm not gonna do anything to you. I love you. The cleo awards? From last year? But that was before I even met you. It's the first night I ever laid eyes on you. You were the most beautiful thing I ever saw. It was love at first sight. But you didn't approach me, ask me out? Instead you decided to wait and stalk me? Stalk you? it wasn't hard to find angela from the event photos. So you got a job with her company just to get to me? Technically, I didn't get a job. so you didn't even work there. You really are sick. I was gonna come up with an excuse to resign after we met. It just felt so good to be working again. Have somebody as brilliant as angela appreciate my ideas. I thought at the very least I'd be able to leverage it into a job reference. And now what, you're gonna get rid of us? Get rid of you? nicole- I love you. I would never hurt you. But there's no telling what I would do to anybody who stands between you and me. Michael if you really love me, you will not hurt angela. She is poisoning you against me. She's got you thinking I'm creepy and dangerous. Who knows how many other people she's trying to turn against me? That's why we gotta get outta here. mya macintosh. You like the photo? I feel like I chose the best one. Here, take it, take a look. You want us to leave the country? Yeah. You really believe you can pull this off. I sold everything I own! My condo, my car, my damn rolex! I liked that watch! After I sell this building, which I can do outside of the country, we'll have more than enough to live on for a long time, nicole. And angela? That's gonna be a little complicated to bring her along with us. I'm not going without angela. Nicole- this is only gonna work if you're a willing participant, all right? That's always been the problem in our relationship. It's always gotta be about you. I need you to be on my team right now, okay? You're right, michael. I have been selfish and insensitive, but you don't have to hide anymore, because I've been denying my feelings for you. You have? Yes. Honestly, I'm- I'm glad you sabotaged the trial. I'm grateful I lost the job because now that I've had some distance from it, I can see what I really needed. You've shown me that love is more important than anything. See, that's what I've been saying. you're finally seeing it my way? Now I can focus all my energy on you and us. Okay, but what about angela? Because, you know, she- if somebody asks her what happened, they're gonna come looking for me. no, michael. Angela will never get in the way of my happiness. She always has my back. Remember, it was her idea to set us up. Yeah that's true, she did- my god, my god, my god! My god, my god, my god! Are you okay? - Yes. He's moving, he's moving, he's moving! You're not going anywhere. Michael- please listen to me. Put the gun down. What are you gonna do, you gonna shoot me? Put the gun down, michael! I thought you loved me, nicole. I still love you. Angela. We made a good team. It's okay. It's all over. How? Wait, where are you going? To kick it. Nice kick. You don't know how to kick it! let's see. You are the best auntie ever! Thank you so much, I love it! Well, he's just the cutest baby ever! Aren't you, sweetheart? Say, "thank you, auntie!" listen, this is about you, this whole party. You are the one with the new job. I still can't believe you're not gonna be my work wife anymore. And that you're leaving me for that guy. Hey! He's a touch on the mature side. but seriously though. Are you sure we can't entice you to come back? I'm sure you could squeeze glenn for a lot more money. He feels really bad about everything. I think it's time for a change, but thank you. Who's that guy? Hi. - Hi. I'm michael. Rick. Yeah, I-I work with joe. Okay, okay. Look, I didn't do it. I didn't invite him. I swear, my set up days are over. Okay.
