[Pamela] Is that a Hugh? It's hard so don't worry about that. Now, listen, you wanna- - I'm done. It's more exciting in the glass cube. Meet me there. Sure, bitch. Now, listen, the secret to this business- - Oh, you have the secret? Yeah, I have one, too. Do tell. I have an idea. You need a million likes to have an idea. This whole fucking business is based on followers, and hashtags and likes. Fuck you if you don't have likes. You wanna hear it? Of course, bitch. Do it. Okay. Have I told you that I love you? No. Only sponsor for me. I've always believed in you, you know that. Oh. This one? Really? I'm an eight. Oh. I'm sorry, I have to go now. Hurry up, baby. And good luck. Okay. Okay, okay, see you, see you. You realize you are far more beautiful when you smile? Like while you're on TV. There are three kinds of people. Those who feel depressed because they see other better than themselves. Those who feel better because they see other worse off, and those that they learn to compare themselves only against themselves. But that's brilliant! But of course, I would expect that from you. You are Roberto Cere, I follow you on Instagram! You need no introduction, Pamela Galante. This is my book. I hope it's gonna help you. This is a present from me to you. And. Oh! Thank you. "Io Ci Sono". You know, you may be right. I should want more from life. There is not a better time to start than the present. Have a nice day. Thank you. Do you want me to connect your phone to the Bluetooth in order to listen to some other radio station? No, man. I understand Italian. Just don't speak it. Not by choice. I don't think. You know. I know. I just find it incredible that someone who doesn't speak Italian could be appointed to our government. I know. I know. I mean like when I first came to your country and I met Sylvia and we started our first businesses, I could have never imagined that an Italian American kid from Michigan could ever have been appointed to the Italian Ministry of Culture. I mean, it's, it's insane. I know only in Italy. Only in Italy. Oh geez. Hold on. Oh, it's the wife, you're not here. I'm on a plane. Oh actually, sir. According to my calculation, you are in a car on the way to the hotel. Oh, you are good! I'm just, I'm just kidding, honey. It was for the kid. Marco, the driver. But, never mind. How are? Sweetie, I miss you so much already. And yeah, we landed, we're, we're already in Greece, driving, but we're driving into a tunnel. We're driving into a Greek tunnel going into the underground. So if you, if I lose you don't look behind you. You'll, you'll disappear. You'll get dragged into Hades. I'm having a hard time hearing you though because of the reception. This kind of spot. No, I'm not on vacation. I'm, hello? Hello. God, I love that woman. Listen, I need a write up on Athens, all right? So gimme something prepared. You know, all the shit you do that this... Boy look at you. That's the, you're incredible. You know, every, every successful man needs the right woman to lie to, Marco. Maybe one day you'll meet her when the time is right. Wait, one day mean that I'm gonna meet some girl to lie to or I'm gonna meet your wife? I really don't know. Okay, see that over here? This is one of our city's most important monuments. I won't apologize for the bird excrement, but it is good luck, right? The guy who said getting shit on by a bird, Marco, was shat on by a bird. He's beautiful. What the fuck are we doing here? What's next? Oh, I got this for you. Olympiacos. That's good thinking. Thanks. These guys killed Lazio on the Champions League, right? I'm impressed that you know that. You gotta study your prey, my friend. All right. You know that little pedal next to the brake? - Yeah. - Step on it. There's not a giant baby on the loose is there? No, sir. It, it's a mock up of my parents' latest project. Okay. How's that? Well basically they're living in a bigger glass cube for a month. What do you mean living? I mean, eating, drinking, you know, sleeping. Maybe. Where do they shit? That's the mystery. They're artists. David Blaine lived in a glass cube. He was dangling above London. He's a magician. So, I guess he made his shit disappear? Artists sell their shit. Write that down. And sell it? Exactly. Okay. I've written down the bullet points for the reform bill of the theater, basically fighting for the intellectual. Ah, intellectuals. They vote, sir. I love the theater people. Can the bipolar vote twice? All right. Champagne. Yeah. You do speak Italian, sir. Just enough to get by with waiters and girls. And I left you some lasagna in the freezer. You have to put in the oven for 20 minutes, but I left you some instruction anyway. All right. So how much is this fiasco gonna cost me? Mm. I'll have the final number by Monday. And you charged it all to the campaign finance? Of course! See, we can't be, you know, too clean. Voters, they don't trust you otherwise. And make sure you leak that. Okay. De Angelis. I hate this bastard. Yeah. We checked his mother into a clinic for Alzheimer's sir. - Yeah. - 4,000 voters. Oh, of course he does. 4,000. Ciao, my friend. I'm so sorry to hear about your mother. How is she? Si, I, no, that's terrible. Yeah, it's awful. Yeah, these, these illnesses they're, they're such a, they're such a terrible part of life. Oh! Man, really! I feel, I feel terrible for the both of you. No, that, it's absolutely my pleasure. You know, the, the, the, the clinic administrator. He's a very good friend of mine. It was my absolute pleasure. No, she's in she's she's she's in very good hands. I, ah! He's crying. Don't forget the building amnesty. No, no, no, we've been very busy, haven't we? We've been very busy with the electoral campaign. No, I can see the light at the end of the tunnel though. Let's hope it's not a drain. Look as long as we're speaking amnesty, if I win the election, I'm gonna be very good to you, but I want you to know you gotta be very good to me too, huh? Say it. First class. Marco will cover. Yeah, well, he'll, he'll, he'll take care of it. From appetizer to dessert. Dessert. How do you say dessert? Dolce. Yeah, yeah, just, and say hello to your 4,000 voters for me and our, our, our prayers are with you. Si, si. Okay, okay. Jesus Christ. Apparently we have to take care of dinner for 4,000 people. Keep it down to, I don't know, 15 euros a head, yeah? What if we held a dinner party at the Balfour restaurant? I like it. - I will call them? - No, no. That's the shogun. That's great. Kendo. (shouts) See, that's a, that's a kiai right there, right? You can, you can, you can, you can cripple your opponent with your voice even before the blade touches them. Even before the fight, you can win, right? Your horror is your belly. You need a big belly. None of these flat abs. You need a belly. That's your horror, and your shin, Your shin is the energy that comes right outta your, right outta your head. You don't know a thing I'm talking about, do you? I don't, sorry. Whoop! Hey, watch your step. Watch that step. Hup! This is actually my parents' bedroom, sir. Relax. They're in a box somewhere aren't they? What they don't know won't hurt 'em. You're right. What if we move the dinner to Bebo? I can it down to 10 euros there. Including appetizer and dessert? Yes, sir. And after dinner drinks, sir. Sweet. All right. Let's run through it. Okay. 15 Minutes to noon. Cameras go live online, everywhere, but here, and the relax room. Five minutes to noon, she arrives. 11:00 PM. He shows up through this door with a gun in his hand and then ties you up. Sir. Your hat on the bed. It's bad luck. And this is my parents' last installation. It's a room dedicated to relax and aromatherapy and chromotherapy. Yeah. I don't remember this. Oh yeah. What is that? That, it smells the divine. Oh, it's a mix of wild herbs and Mediterranean spices. God, can I put that on my salad? Is it legal? Yeah. It shouldn't be. Oh my God. No, I wanna live in here. No, better yet. Shoot me now, I'm done. No, sir. There are no guns in these house. My parents are pacifists. Of course they are. They live in a box. It's all right. I still love them. Okay. As of now, my phone is off. Yep. What if suddenly something happens in the government? How can I reach you? Should I just show up? Listen, there are men far greater than us slipping into that tall black patent leather woman's police boot called Italy tonight, my friend. We're fine. Now everything is on. Camera is live. You mean the public just saw me take a honk and hit off of... Yeah. All right. That's good. And message sent. Cool. Oh, it's the good stuff. A statement for leaving your security leaders for their duties this weekend. So none of my security know that I'm here. Correct. Good. My head of security. I don't trust this guy. Should have got rid of him when I got into office. Fire him Monday. Okay. So the girl she's here? Yeah. She's in the shower. She's good. Right? I mean she speaks English, right? Perfectly. You touch that, I'll cut you! All right. Let's run through it again. Okay. Where am I? [Marco] You are on a secret diplomatic mission in Greece. Does anybody know? Of course, everybody. - Perfect. - Yeah. They all think you're in Athens right now. I made up this story for the press and your family as well. Until? Until you are caught on a state of the art audio/video surveillance cameras, and having a rendezvous with your quote, girlfriend. My, quote, very famous girlfriend. Very famous, yes, yes. What's her name? - Pamela Galante. - Pamela Galante. She's an internet sensation. She's an actress. And she speaks English? And she's memorized her lines, she knows the script? Yeah. Enrico's memorized the script. He's memorized everybody's lines. All right. We just gotta think positive Marco. 'Cause if we can pull this off, we can win the majority with this scandal, do you know what this means? Yeah. You probably become the head of the party. Possibly prime minister. Yeah, and? And yeah, of course. That's bring massive value increases to all of your branded- - You're goddam right! - Yeah! That's exactly what it, what it does. Look at there's Gardenia and Schoffnolinger, and, and, and, oh gosh, you got Joyce. I didn't know you read Ulysses? He is one. My favorites. Hmm. Yeah, America has produced some fine writers. Yep! Sir, take a look. That her? Oh, look at that. She looks good. Oh, very nice. Yeah. She's fab. I'm never wrong about women. Marco! Darling! I'm so glad we could spend this time together at long last! So relaxing. You think that blissful peace relax you? I know you. Three days on a blissful peace and you are just like, he, me, you be ready to blow your brains... Out! I know you wanted to go. I know you wanted to go to Ibiza but we'd end up on the front page of every paper! Marco! Unfortunately the political fact has become super big, there is no longer an adversary. That's the wrong line! Learn the script! That's our girl. I mean, that's our girl. We'll talk about her later. Darling! I'm gonna go slip into something a little more comfortable, darling. Like a noose. Oh, sorry Marc. It's important. Oh yeah. Hi. I speak all in English now. Yeah. We are filming a viral scandal with American Minister of Culture. Shh! No you! Shh! What? Is it me or is that crazy? What's crazy! I have to go to visit my mom in the clinic! No, no you don't! Oh, what's wrong with your mom? - It's Alzheimers! - It's Alzheimers! - Hey! - Hey! [Pamela] I'm sorry. Thank you. She says to call, I can't keep her waiting! No! And we are out of cigarette. Okay. - I have to go! - I'll go with you. - Don't worry. - It's okay. - No, don't bother. - It's not a problem. [Marco] No need. - It's my pleasure. - No, really. No, I'm, I'm- It's fine. You don't need that. - Yeah, I- - It's fine, it's fine. I'll walk you out. Who the hell did you hire? Sir, sir. I think she's very promising. - Promising? - Yes. Promise, I promise to kick 100% of your ass! No, no, no, stop! Stop, sir! Sir! You hired an Insta model! She's not even real! What? The comments on my Instagram profile are very real for your information. I imagine likes are something you wouldn't have to worry about? Darling, sweetheart. So sorry, honey. Please! Look, the cameras are on, please, please, I understand. We, honey! We don't wanna, listen, we. Honey, I'll bend over backwards to make this nice for us. Can we just please? I could do some prime time! I know, and you will. I promise you. You will! If I don't make a jump now when? Yeah. Fair enough. Okay. Who do I have to call? The director name is Mascio. Forget the director. No one cares about the director. Who's the boss? Bertolami. Bertolami. I know Bertolami. - Yeah? - Yeah, it's fine. Boss. Look I'm, I'm sorry. [Georgio] Bertolami? It's Martini. - Oh. Minister! - Ciao, Guido. Listen, my niece, Pamela Galante, is, she's got an audition, okay? And the, what's the director's name? Machio! With Machio. She has audition with Machio on Monday. Monday, and apparently, rumor has it, that someone else is being considered for the role. Someone with more haters than likes, and, who, what's her name? Nina Cavani. Nina Cavani is being considered and that, we can't have that on prime time, can we? So can I count on you? Can we, can we get a meeting for, for Pamela? [Marco] I'm sorry, minister, but we cannot accept recommendation. Let me plant that back in your brain again. I'd like a meeting for Pamela Galante on Monday. Oh, whatever, man. Let me think. What about massage treatment at Basiliani Spa, for two? Thank you very much. Sure. No, of course. Oh, it would be my pleasure. You're so kind. Ciao. Good bye. You do the guy a favor and he's trying to screw ya. It all revolves around sex. Yeah, except sex. Sex revolves around power. Which reminds me. We are going to power down our phones. Don't move. I'll be right back. All right. Let's, let's try the lines again from the top. Okay? Okay. All right, so I'm gonna say, "Look what I brought you. I brought you some champagne. Oh, let me take a picture. Oh, bubbles get us some likes. Wait, I need a stro." - Straw. - Stro. Stro. And I say, "Let, no drink it like this! Oh, it's cold. You are getting me wet all over. Ooh. Talk about likes. Oh yes! You like that? Oh, give me luxury and I renounce necessities." Necessities? Exactly. Just like that, yeah. Okay. No, from the top. Freeze your hands! You, your hands! What are you? What are you doing? Okay. You're you're early. It's not now? No, it's not now. No, please! Don't shit! - D-Don't? - Shoot! That's early too. Okay? That's not now. Don't shit or shoot. That's not now. And that's not here. Neither of those things are here. They're in the other room. Both of those lines are supposed to happen in the other room where there are cameras, see, there are no cameras here. So if you can just wait- How do I look? - You look beautiful. - Me? No, not would you get the outta here? All right. That was, that was good. Are you gonna do it like that? Oh my God! You said. Oh, God! Not the video. Oh, my God. It's horrible. You! You now. Watch my pig face. Look. I know you! All right. I know you. I see you in prison. You're beautiful. I do much with you in my mind! I see you are, Squizzando. You saw me, Squizzando? Yes! You, you're very, very good. I love on Squizzando when you, you move your body, and- Dance now! Do the dance now! No. Don't dance now. Let's, so help me, if you do. You don't, okay, that's not. Oh. You are oh, good. Why don't you sit down? Please sit down. Please sit down. Whoa, sit, sit down! Thank you. Thanks. You! Your name! Name? I'm Giorgio. Giorgio Martini. Yes. He was on TV often? Yes. That. I'll never want you with no clothes! All right? Yeah. I can see that. You are who? Giorgio Martini. You are, who? George. Giorgio Martini! I said that. - You! - I don't know what you're saying. What are you saying? Jesus! Okay? What is your job? - Do, my, minister - What! I'm the Minister of Culture and my bodyguards will be here any minute. What are you saying? You are important man? That's right. What? Don't you speak Italian? My men'll be here. So you might as well give yourself up. You? Yeah. No! Yes. No! Yes. Would, would you tell him please what. He think he's a very, very important person. (laughs) Thank you. How much this country make me laugh. In Italy, anyone can become whatever they want! You are the Minister. What are you saying? Why don't you stick to the script? Listen. My men will be here. All right. Give yourself up or so help me. I'll take you down. You say, you say men arrive, huh? But who believes you? Huh? You a politician. You liar. Every breath you take. - That's not- - Look at my pig face. - Why isn't he- - Look at my pig face! Okay. You wear a mask every day. No difference between you and me. - That's good. - Oh no, no, I no need. I no need mask. What, what are you doing? No, I no need mask! (country rock music) The fuck are you doing? You are a pig. No, okay? That's insane! You, you are the pig. Now, I open your eyes. You doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing? You can see everything. Not with your eyes, but with your ride. Feast your eyes! What, are you! What are you doing? You! Dance! He's very good. Where did you find him? He used to work for me. It's your production value. How fantastic. Please, please, please call me anytime. This guy's a maniac. He's gonna blow everything up. This isn't in the script? No Squizzando, this isn't the script. All right. We gotta stay rational. We're gonna take a deep breath, 'cause he can come in here any minute, okay? Just gotta keep our heads. We just gotta stay calm. Help! Help! Yeah, we can do that. We can do that too. Just do that. What the fuck is going on? Hey. Hi. Did you like our explosion? I heard it. Let's see. There's been some changes to the script, Enrico dropped the Romanian accent and, and he no longer wants to work with the mask. Two very strong choices, I know. Which means he either doesn't mind going back to prison, or he wants to kill himself in front of the world. Not before killing us first. Which reminds me. The gun? It's loaded. - Loaded? - Yeah. Did you get your cigarettes? - Yeah. - Can I have one? How are we doing? Look, no- - Incoming. Here he is. Relax, huh? There's nowhere to go. Many bombs outside. I have control. I'm dead before I create my foundation. What is it for, very noble.? To teach girl to code. Very noble. Who. are you? I'm his personal assistant. Huh? I feel bad for you. You want the gun, huh? I see you. He keeps saying that. Why is he doing this? What? Exiting up stage to the kitchen? I have no idea. He has been off script all night. [Enrico] And I hear you! Sir. I didn't wanna say anything but how did it happen? Bad casting. And now what, we're gonna do? You're gonna be a hero because I only have one life. So you better figure it out. We have two lives. The second begins when we realize we have only one. I think is it in your carrier? Pearls on swine? Well, how can you eat this shit? Well if you miss prison food, that badly, there are easier ways my friend. Five years in prison. It's a long time. You imagine five years? Listen. Our party has fought hard for prison reform. We're the party for prisoners. Do you know what they do? First thing in prison? No, I'm... No idea. No idea. If he just go out of prison, he's broke. Offer him cash. You're right. It's, I, you're absolutely right. You've been, five years is a long time and you probably do need some money. So in a couple hours I could get you 10,000 euros. What's the first thing they do in prison, you know? Don't be cheap. More. 20,000. You want 20,000. You're good for 10,000. Right? 20,000 euros. How does that sound? First thing when you arrive. Oh, you know, I don't know. Help me out here, Marco. Any ideas? None, sir. I have a perfect record, so. - No idea, huh? - No idea. No idea. First thing. Be baptized. Baptized. Well, I know they have a chapel, don't they? It's not entirely clear. So if you can tell us exactly what this involves in details. Hey, don't be stupid. Everyone knows what's happening in prison. Yes. (soft music) You decide who takes, who gives? Of course I have heard of this. Now you too decide who takes, who gives? I'm sorry? You like your secretary? Let me assure you, sir. I don't have that level of security clearance. All right. Look. That's quite enough, Max, Katie, Laine. Firstly, I'm hetero, okay? And I'm married. Okay. And I've never cheated on my wife. Come on, Marco. Help me out here. Say something would you? And that something will be what sir? You're secretary? - Yes, yes. - Yeah. And boss? Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Now, - Now? Fuck him! And now I'm going to have an intelligent conversation with this woman. Don't worry. I don't touch you. I just want you away from this pig. Oh! I'm sorry. I mean, she nice! I like! Boobs like mother. (grunts) Pig man! Well, at least that was in the script. - Sure. - Was she smiling? Don't be scared. This is the right path. He's planted bombs all around the house. Even if we could grab her without you getting shot, where would we go? I wouldn't want my flesh would slowing us down, sir. Unless of course, you know, you swept for mines, but that would just take too long with your- - With my gunshot, sir. - With your gunshot wound. Exactly. No, although I'll appreciate it and your sacrifice would be remembered. I, I do not advise this. I'm sorry, man. I just, I can't sign off on this Marco. I see. I hope she's alright. Really something, huh? Well, I don't really know, sir. I'm not very experienced with female form. What? Yeah. I'm gay. It's true. (chuckles) You're not gay. You're engaged. I am engaged, but, and I love them. I just never said he was a man. Well, first, (mumbles). Okay. Congratulations. Thank you. I thought you would fire me. No, no. Why would I do that? Because you would have a gay secretary? No! I mean, look, I mean, I hire male secretaries, 'cause I want to avoid sexual harassment suits. I mean and this is certainly a gay change, game changer! But I've, you know, your work's always been exceptional, except this, of course, this is a shit show, but, I wouldn't not keep you on because, now I kind of have to keep you, don't I? Otherwise I can sue you? Yeah. I won't, sir. That's not my leg touching you, by the way. No. Bertolami. Bertolami. So how does it work in the holidays? Like, do you go visit his parents or does he, does he, does he visit yours? Well, it depends. It's Christmas at mine. Easter at his. Or vice versa. Very democratic. [Enrico] It's me! Come on now, Enrico! Okay. Look what? How can I help you, man? Huh? The ways you helped her. What? You called Bertolami, didn't you? Please, call him again. Wasn't it the last call the minister made? You're a little shit. Call him. Go ahead. This helps no one. (phone rings) Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! It's your phone? Just trying to help. And you? What you have to say? She calls Bertolami and it's you on the other end? Typical. Oscar winning performance, Martini. In the role of the man. What did she just say? Oh, a compliment, sir. Wasn't I your most trusted man? Yeah. Yeah. You were. I trusted you. And you're turning your back on me. That was the trial. And now we can make it right. We can make it right right now. Hmm. What about Sylvia? What about Sylvia? Leave my wife out of this. You always told me that I was part of the family, but I, I never met her. I never met her either. And trust me, you never will. What do you think? Shall we call her? She has nothing to do with this. Now let's talk cash, 'cause clearly that's what- - You think cash can solve your problems? You really are a pig. The classes between the classes exist, especially where classes are absent. All right, enough Confucius. Now, listen, we there's nothing to be embarrassed by here. Okay? What are you doing? What are you doing? Repent! - What am I, Fredo? - Repent! Just, I mean, come on man! You're just your little, you're trying my patience. Patience is everything in life. You know? Do you know much patience I've had? Excuse me? What exactly you were in prison for? Falsifying financial records. The truth will come out. You're going to love what I have on this little device. What is that? It's a screenplay for my film. Jesus. Did you write it or did you steal it? I have a little role for you. Yeah. Careful, honey. No matter what he says, never sleep with a writer. I don't have to sleep with anybody. Fair enough. My role is perfect for you. He is a real prick. And you, feel free to improvise. Thank you. Careful what you wish for. He's a very complex and multifaceted personality. Hmm. Now, we can have a little talk. Come on. Come on, guys. Go ahead. Yeah, go ahead. Please. Now, we are going to play a little game. Come on, everyone on the sofa. I thought he missed those. I think they heard it in Otranto. Now, we are going to play Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. Eeny, meeny, miny, moe was in your script? Yeah. We're not doing the Eeny, meeny, miny, moe scene anymore. Oh yes, we are doing Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. I love Eeny, meeny, miny, moe. It's my favorite to sing. Do you have the fake finger? I think he's serious. Eeny-meeny... Okay. What do you want? No. (screams) I want you to confess. To confess what? That all was bullshit! Catch a tiger by the toe. Which part? If he hollers let him, go. This lie you are telling the public with this farce. Eeny, meeny, - Okay. - Miny, What? All right, look! All right, it was me, it was me! Me all! Okay, I did it! It was me. Io! It was all bullshit, okay? And we were going to leak to the media, showing me in a affair with a woman I had never met before. Lovely actress. And you, my friend, were going to rob us posed as an immigrant Romanian, I think with a very believable accent. And I was going to save the day and prove heroic in the eyes of the nationalist voters. Happy? So ironic. Coming from an immigrant. You took the job. Now is the hypocrisy. Let's examine the full extent of your treachery. You'll never work in this province again. Can I take my finger? Yes. You two stay here. Giorgio and I are going to have a nice private chat. Why don't you use the relax room? That's a very good idea. The, the relax room. Yes, is a, is a perfect place for a private chat. It's very private and, and very - Relaxing. - Relaxing, yes. Sounds like the perfect place for the tooth to come out. The, for the tooth to come out? The tooth! Look, the man, we just did the finger. I don't know if we can. I don't have a tooth. Okay. - You said tooth. - I said truth, sounds like tooth. I never lost one of your social engagements. Such parties to masquerade callers. Invitation all the TV shows. And what? A bullshitter. That was the job description. Yeah. Get on with it. Would you? What is your, what's the play? What's your play man? I'm getting high in here. Okay? You mean my screenplay? [Georgio] Seriously? Yes. Fuck, this is it? - Yes, this is it. - Okay, let's do it. Wait, the role of Giorgio? And I read role of- - Enrico? - Yes. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. We're doing this now. Don't gimme me that sad face, Giorgio. You remind me of when I was in prison. That's your line. All right. Okay. I want to cry, but I sucked it up every single day. I'm sorry! (tense music) Finally! Now Minister Martini will explain why I, Enrico Altieri, had to do five years in prison. I don't un, I don't understand what you're trying to do. We all make mistakes. Tell me why I did the time! Because you wanted to do it your way. This is what you told the court. I'm sure there must have been another episode that I missed, one that I didn't know of? Perhaps a few? That's enough! No. Line says I shout here. - Shout. - No, no! So, talk! Talk fat fuck! What was I, what did I do? You, you played tennis and you know what? You know what? You had talent. When you were 20, you could have been a champion, but it takes more than talent to be the best. It takes heart, and height. And that you never had. Okay. And so the years went by and you became just another washed up athlete, giving bored housewives lessons and fucking them on the side. And to make some extra money, you started putting the fix on matches. You were just a common, low life piece of shit, until I came along and saved your ass. You're right. You saved me, if you want to call it that. You brought me in your so-called family and you made me an important man. Yes. But there was a price for that. Yes! I, covered your eyes, and forget. I burned my soul and I lost five years rotting in prison. And now, I am a man with no life, no money, no family! All these years being your right-hand man! And, what do I have to show for it? Obviously the 400 euros a month that you drop into my account. So you... So you can feel good about, so you can feel good, so you can wash the feet of your wife and your son! Fuck you! There's only the two of us. No one can hear you. It's not really them I'm worried about, you know? What made it. You cheated me. You screwed me over. And I took it and I kept quiet for some change. You raised me, your chief financial officer, thrown out like a piece of garbage! Who set me up? Who? No one, no one set you up! We agreed. We agreed. It was graft. Okay, it was graft. You signed, okay. You signed, you go to jail. We agreed. We, you, five months, five months is all, not five years! You made it five years, you fucking lunatic! Like anger management. That's all I can recommend. I'm sorry. This is why your wife left you. Okay. This is why, not my fault! So take some fucking responsibility for once in your god damn life. Jesus Christ. It's never you. If I would've said Enrico, go jump in front of a train, would you do it? Si! Yes! Going into politics against someone is easy. Just like in business, I suppose. And I've done that many times, but going into politics for an ideal, for a belief, that's where the true beauty lies. The world needs more of that beauty. Like in business, I imagine. Be proud of that kind of beauty. Go into politics for your children, for your future. Go forward with a brave heart for the less fortunate, not for the pleasure of your corporate masters. This video of your alleged affair and kidnapping has been all over the world. It's been viewed by millions. Honestly, it's a little puzzling. More so because of the fact that you, Minister Martini, admittedly staged at all to fool the Italian voting public, and leaked and added surveillance tape yourself of your admission to the fact. Yes, I did. Then agreed to drop all charges against your kidnapper, an ex-business associate, even though it appears he meant to actually to cause you harm in the end. Look, if you wanna be happy for one moment, then you avenge yourself. But if you wanna be happy for a lifetime, then you forgive. Look, I didn't press charges because, because as crazy as it sounds, he, he opened my eyes. They all did. Everyone who was present that long and informative day, I am deeply indebted to. Marco, how many times have I taken your, your, your generosity and your professionalism for granted? How hard it must have been to, to maintain my private life while keeping your life private and your life partners. Thanks, Marco. At times, dangerous roads are taken a blessing in disguise, as it happens with Pamela. Your profound insights are a testament that beauty is much more than skin deep, and that likes are just are wants, but only less. But you are so much more. Thank you, Pamela. (country music) You know, everyone has their demons. Mine just happens to be a guy named Enrico. And I'm okay with that. You know, they say you have to embrace your shadow, even if it doesn't exactly match your physical form. The sooner we accept that the better, I think. I won't deny that in life circumstance plays a vital role. A man makes plans, the universe laughs. Could have been me in that place. Pretty soon it will be. Don't worry, Georgio's the new orange. A friend of mine taught me a little something about responsibility while I was lecturing him on the subject I might add. Tonight, you've seen me with my flaws. I stand naked before you for the first time. Maybe not the first time, I'm really not sure, there might have been cameras in that bedroom. I, I really can't remember. Might be. Lost track. But I want you to see me as I am. A man. People think that politicians are unreachable. I'm here to tell you that that's just not true. And that is really what I came here to show you because I am a live streamer now. You can watch me every day at gogeorgiogo. go But you already have millions of follower. I can only imagine what that is going to mean to your base, and to your position, your party. I know, it's, but you will see, you'll, you'll, you'll all see that I'm just, that I am just like you, like you, only, probably more rich and certainly more famous, but- - And under investigation. Indictment, please get it right, Carlo, okay? I've, you know, I worked hard for this, okay? Don't shortchange me. Now enough for the monitors. Not, all right, look. I want you to know. I have the blind certainty of my beliefs and the flexibility of character suited for public service. I think I have your friendship and your affection. I'm really not certain until I finally learn your language. And I promise to get on that as soon as I get out of prison, which I hope will be soon. As soon as I get in, which I hope will be sooner. We're also working on that and we're in talks to hopefully live stream from the general public in there. The rest of the time will be in house arrest, though comfortable, I don't think it will provide as much interesting content, but feel free to send us any questions. We'll be sending updates on prison tats and recipes from in the inside. Please don't send any, any contraband in any cakes. I don't wanna extend my, my sentence any. Buddy of mine knows all about that. Don't you Enrico? I'm grateful for the time you afforded me and the kind invitation to participate in your process. And I, I also want to throw a shout out to Pamela's Instagram at Pamela Galante. Okay? And a very special thank you to my wife, Sylvia, who has forgiven my weaknesses and transformed them for me. Thank you, Sylvia. You are always there for me. Thank you. Where are you, honey? Stand up, babe. All right, look, if you're still gonna withhold your trust for me, just remember one thing- - At at, Pamela Galante, I'm sorry. (gentle music) If someone judges your path, let them walk in your shoes. If they can fit in them or something better. Eh, wasn't that it? Anyway, ciao duty. Anyway, bye-bye! I'll see you. (applause) Waiting long? A bit. Ah, sorry. No time is me time these days. Thanks for coming. I ordered your favorite tea. Oh, no. No thank you. So I see you have over 2 million followers. Business is good. I getting closer to 15, but did you invite me here to dazzle? Did you have something important to talk about? Well, there's a client and they want to finance a reality show. He wants to work with us! You mean me? And Martini. Of course, Martini. Won't be cheap. I didn't expect it to be. Okay. Tell your client if they want to do the show, they cover production costs and we take 50%. 50%? They never go for that. If they want our faces in the show. That's the deal. If they wait I tell 15 million, the cost would be 16. Okay. I make it happen. Okay, good. I like it when you do your job. Is 15 million going to make you happy? Happy doesn't matter when you are the one that decide what makes people happy. [Georgio] I won't deny that in life circumstance A man makes plans the universe laughs. Could have been me in that place. Pretty soon it will be. Don't worry. Georgio's the new orange. A friend of mine taught me a little something about responsibility, while I was lecturing him on the subject, I might add. Tonight, you've seen me with my flaws. I stand naked before you for the first time. Maybe not the first time. I'm really not sure. There might have been cameras in that bedroom. I, I really can't remember. Might be. Lost track. But I want you to see me as I am. A man. People think that politicians are unreachable. Well, I'm here to tell you tonight, they're not, because I wanted to show you that I am now a live streamer. You can now watch me and follow me at gogeorgiogo.go. What did I miss? [Enrico] Nothing big, really. You were standing naked before us. Exactly. - Hey. - Oh, in prime time! That's a very noble concern. I know. You know, they're considering me for prime minister. I should make you Minister of Education. No, thank you. I want a position with the some power. I want my own talk show. In what language? (snorts) As crazy as it sounds. What about you, Marco? How does Minister of Culture sound? Hmm. Like the name of a rapper. I can see that. Yeah. See what you did there. But I like it. Thank you. Cheers. Enrico. Marco. I can't offer you a low level position in government due to your felony conviction. That's unfortunately reserved for higher offices, but I would very much like you to come back to work with me at Geodio Enterprises. - No, thank you, Georgio. - Okay. Oh, sorry. Thanks. But, I have a feeling, I know how that may end up. Besides, As it happens, I have some personal projects I'm working on right now. All right. Okay. As a matter of fact, I really must be going. [Georgio] But you have so much promise. Thank you, Pamela. Thank you. Mine just happens to be a guy named Enrico. I'm okay. You know, they say you have to embrace your shadow, even if it doesn't exactly Hey. Yo, hey, hey, hey, hey. Is there any way I can get you to reconsider? Because I really think that I need you right now. No, you don't. Trust me. I carried you around for a long while. I just realized that the only thing it was good for was get rid of you. No, none taken. Did you write that? - I suppose. - Yeah, it was good. Wish I did. I'm gonna read this. Is there more? Is that the personal project you were you're gonna work on? No, I just said that to get away from you. Oh, okay. And yes, there was more. You know, in prison, I wrote one act plays. Really? See, I would've never, I would've never guessed that about you. Yeah. One was about Tim Buckley meeting Jeff Buckley and in afterlife and Chama with her son. Okay. Now that is insane! In the very best sense of the word. Oh. And another is about a man in submarine that malfunctions at 500 meters. And he writes a sonnet in Morse code before oxygen runs out. Dude, you are killing me right now. Right. And, and, and there are more. Yeah, but you don't know me, really. Excuse me, but now I have to go. Huh? All right. All right. But can I still call you? And you have Marco's number, right? I mean, he could, we can, I guess parents are coming back too. And I, I guess it might be a good idea if you come back and clear up some of those landmines, and you get, if you're in the neighborhood, I guess they can put us on a group text or something like that. But if it's convenient, or don't worry about it. I reach out. I should really get going now. Yeah, I don't hold you up. Man, thanks for coming, all right? Thank you. Good to see you.
