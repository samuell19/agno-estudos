"Life is like a railway station," Stevie said. "The train of birth brings us in, "the train of death will carry us away." Hmm. All aboard for a trip to the suburbs. [TRAIN HONKING] [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] I'm back. I'm back. Where are you? Up here. Just coming. Ah, you're home nice and early. I'm utterly exhausted. Worn to a frazzle. Well, the kettle's on. I'll make a pot of tea. -Anything to eat? -Battenberg cake and some ginger nuts. -How lovely. -Give me your coat. -Anything happened today? -No. No. Nothing out of the ordinary. [SIGHS] I think when I'm asked at the Day of Judgment what I remember best, what has ruled my entire life, I shall say, "Being tired, too tired for words." I've been at the BBC recording a story. I don't know why I bothered. It was a complete waste of time. The Producer seemed to have quite a different idea about the story from mine, and we got more and more at cross purposes, and a Mr. Hall, who was sitting on the floor listening, said he couldn't make head or tail of it. Head or tail of what? This is my Aunt. Who are you talking about? Well, his name was Mr. Hall. -Head or tail of what? -A short story I'd written. Huh. Poor man. I know how he felt. [LAUGHING] I call her the Lion of Hull. She looks very lion-like, don't you think? The dress is new by the way. It reminds me of one of those seed packets, you know, Carters tested seeds. I call it Every One Came Up. Where are my glasses, Peggy? In the fruit bowl. All these books, just look at them. Not a literary person, thank God. I've never seen so much stuff and nonsense in all me life. [TAP DRIPPING] That stupid kitchen tap needs a new washer. Tarnation take it. Huh. -Where's me cushion? -Hmm? Oh, it's here. Sorry. Eh, you can never find anything in this house. Smart writing people think it's not at all chic to live in the suburbs with an aunt, but I don't care what they think. I've never cared about chic things. Fashion and so on. What does it matter? I love Aunt and Aunt loves me. That's what really matters. -Tea, dear? -Thank you, darling. Oh. -Good? -Mmm-hmm. Ah. Well, where shall I begin? Begin at the beginning and go through to the end. -That's what I always say. -Yes, and quite right, too. [LAUGHS] The 20th of September, 1902. That was the beginning for me. The 20th of September. Virgo. Rather a prim sign, I always think so. I like to pretend to be a bit of Libra, too. [LAUGHS] A Yorkshire lass. Born in Hull. 34 De La Pole Avenue. Such a nice house. We left when I was only three. So I don't remember much about it. Just wearing a pale blue coat and eating strawberries and cream on a vast stretch of bright green grass with people in white on it. A cricket club tea. -Of course, yes, it must have been. -[LAUGHS] So on a fine September afternoon in 1906, my mother, my aunt, my 5-year-old sister, Molly, and I came here to Palmers Green. All those years ago. It doesn't seem possible. She was a romantic girl, my mama. And because of this, she made what they call an unsuitable marriage. If your grandma had lived, your mother and father would never have met, let alone married. Where would Stevie have been then, poor thing? He was a great believer in independence, was your grandfather. "Decide for yourself," he was always saying. Huh, and that's just what she did. Oh, there's me paper. My mother was a romantic girl, so she had to marry a man with his hair in curl, who subsequently became my unrespected papa. But that is a long time ago now. What folly it is that daughters are always supposed to be in love with papa. It wasn't the case with me. I couldn't take to him at all, but he took to me. What a sad fate to befall a child of three. I sat upright in my baby carriage and wished Mama hadn't made such a foolish marriage. I tried to hide it, but it showed in my eyes unfortunately. A fortnight later, Papa ran away to sea. He used to come on leave. It was always the same. I could not grieve, but I think I am somewhat to blame. Oh, Pancho Gonzalez is doing well, into the quarter finals. So with my father sailing the seven seas, we came here to Avondale Road. After we'd settled in, we went round the corner to our landlord's shop. He was a plumber. A tall, thin man, who looked like Charles the Second. We went round the corner to arrange a few things and to get me weighed. [CHUCKLES] You were always being weighed for one reason or another. He had the most enormous weighing machines, I remember. The kind you use to weigh luggage. AUNT: ''You're a fine package," he said, lifting you onto the scales. "I came on a train," you said. "I came on a train and then on a tram." [LAUGHS] And so you did. Bless your heart. Well, he was wrong, that plumber. I wasn't a fine package. I was always being ill. Yes, that's why I came to London. Someone had to look after you, with your mother being so weak and poorly. Yes, I often wished I could have been a bright, healthy child. But I wasn't, so that's that. Fate I suppose. Stevie's fate. Fate indeed. Oh, I believe in fate. I really do. "It's like a man playing cards." Stevie said. There's the man himself and the cards he's playing, and another man watching over his shoulder. The player is life, the watcher is the spirit, and the cards are fate. Stevie's fate was unfortunate, to say the least. It was tuberculosis. I spent months and months in a Children's Hospital. I first thought of suicide when I was eight. The thought cheered me up wonderfully. "Life may be treacherous," I remember thinking, "but you can always rely on death." It also occurred to me that if one can remove oneself from the world at any time, why particularly now? I realized death is my servant, he's got to come if I call him. I think every sensitive young child should learn this. It's a great source of strength and comfort. -More tea, Peggy dear? -Oh, yes please. Eventually, of course, I got better and came back home to Avondale Road. How sweet the birds of Avondale are. Avondale of Avondale. How sweet the birds of Avondale, who swoop and sing and call. [BOTH LAUGHING] My sister, Molly, and I thought this was a beautiful house, -and a beautiful garden, And so it was. Well, so it is. -Yes. Although our more cautious elders would only sign a lease for the first six months, we've been here ever since. Mind you, it was a country place then, with woods stretching all the way up to Southgate station. But I still find it very dreamy and poetical. The people are charming, too. They have a helpful, non-interfering politeness, which is very like old Chinese courtesy. -Is it, er, 6:00 yet? -Hmm? Uh, it's 20 to. Oh, soon be time to do the vegetables. Two old ladies lived next door to us then. -Miss Jessie. -Miss Jessie. [TOGETHER] And Miss Emily. Miss Jessie was always very busy doing missionary work. She was forever collecting clothes for the heathens. She was a very bright, happy person, unlike her sister, Miss Emily, who was full of doom and despair. It was from Miss Emily that we first learnt about the White Slave Traffic. -Yes. Your mother was very cross about it. -Mmmm. AUNT: "I've told you, Peggy," I remember her saying to you. "I've told you never to speak to strangers in the street, or to take sweets from them. "So run along and do as I tell you "and don't worry a head about the White Slave Traffic." But it was too late. Miss Emily had fired my imagination. -Huh. -"If a lady comes up to you," she said, "If a lady comes up to you in a closed cab and leans out of the window "and asks you to get in with her, don't you have anything to do with her." Then she clasped hold of my hand and pulled me up tight. I can still remember her old lady smell. Lavender and moth balls, dusty velvet ribbon. Those menthol lozenges she always used to suck. Oh, yes. [LAUGHS] Occasionally the faint smell of her old dog clinging to her skirt. "Don't you have anything to do with her," she'd said. "She's the White Slave Traffic." But what would happen if one yielded to the blandishments of this strange lady in a closed cab. Oh, that we didn't know. -I've never heard such nonsense. -[LAUGHS] Maybe not. I believed every word of it. Stuff and nonsense you should've known better. Well, I wasn't very old, was I? Seven or eight at the most. -Old enough to know better. -Oh. You were at school after all. -That's right, so I was. -MMmm. So I was. Schoolgirl Stevie. [LAUGHS] We had a most unusual headmistress I remember. What was her name? -What was whose name? -Our headmistress. Tall woman, wore glasses. I've no idea. Quite forgotten. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. She was a Quaker lady, I remember that. A Quaker lady with a true devotion for teaching. She believed in discipline and had a high... Well, some people might say a rather simple moral code. She used to recite her own moralistic verses to us at morning prayers. "I wish that I were some beautiful land "called the Land Of Beginning Again, "where all our mistakes and all our heartaches "and all of our poor, foolish pain "could be dropped like a shabby coat at the door "and never put on again. No never more." Oh, that's rather good. We didn't like that one. We thought it was soppy. -Oh. -But there was a fine touch of melodrama about one of our headmistress's favorites, which went... How was it? "'Tomorrow,' she told her conscience, 'tomorrow I'll try and be good. "'Tomorrow I'll think as I ought. Tomorrow I'll do as I should. "'Tomorrow I'll conquer the passions that keep me from heaven away,' "But ever her conscience whispered one word and one only. 'Today.' "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. "And thus through the years it went on. "Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. "Till youth, like a shadow, was gone. "Till age and her passions had written the message of fate on her brow. "And forth from the shadows came death "with the terrible syllable... [SHOUTS] "No!" Peggy dear, please. -You frightened the life out of me. -Mmm. We liked that one. Our headmistress, like more professional readers of verse, didn't pull her punches when it came to expression. That "Now" fairly shocked us all. Beans or carrots, Peggy? -What are we having? -Lamb. Oh, beans then, please. Beans it is. Actually I was rather mal vue at school, and er, and I'm sure with reason. Though I would rather have been thought naughty than stupid. I think perhaps it was because I was too easily bored. Even now I sometimes indulge in the utmost limit of boredom, until the sound of the telephone ringing is like an Angel of Grace breaking in on the orgy of boredom to which my soul is committed. Hmm. Oh, but by and large, I'm a forward looking girl. I don't stay where I am. "Left, right, be bright," as I once said in a poem. Of course, that's on days when I'm one big bounce and have to go careful so as not to be a nuisance. Above all, I try to avoid being too despairing. I try to remember what they used to say in the 1300s. "Accidie poisons the soul stream." [CHILDREN CHANTING INDISTINCTLY] [SOMBER MUSIC] Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair. It is I, your beautiful lover, who am here. And when I come up this time, I will bring a rope ladder with me. And then we can both escape into the dark wood immediately. Cool as a cucumber, calm as a millpond, sound as a bell was Mary when she went to the Wishing Well. She has not been seen since then. If you ask me, she'll not be seen again. I am a frog. I live under a spell. I live at the bottom of a green well. I have been a frog now for a hundred years, and in all this time I have not shed many tears. I am happy. I like the life. Can swim for many a mile. When I have hopped to the river and am forever agile. "Twas the voice of the Wanderer," I heard her exclaim. You have weaned me, too, soon you must nurse me again. She taps as she passes each window pane. Pray does she not know that she taps in vain. No man has seen her, this pitiful ghost. And no woman, either, but heard her at most. Sighing and tapping and sighing again. You have weaned me too soon. You must nurse me again. Yes, there is a lot of sadness in these childhood poems, but, that's because you soon realize how brief it all is. Schooldays, summer holidays by the seaside, those cloudless September afternoons. Sooner or later, adult fears are bound to seep through. Hey ho, indeed they are. Sooner or later, you realize you're just another human being. Nothing special, just an ordinary mortal like everyone else. What a terrifying thought that is. I was still very young when my mother died. She had suffered greatly, poor, dear Mama. She made an unsuitable marriage. Oh, I'm sure my father found it unsuitable, too. Unsuitable marriages breed the Stevie's of this world, and a great many other troubles as well. The nurse said my mother died quickly, in a minute. How long is that minute? Tender only to one. Tender and true. The petals swing to my fingering. Is it you, or you, or you? Tender only to one, I do not know his name. And the friends who fall to the petal's call, may think my love to blame. Tender only to one, this petal holds a clue. The face it shows, but too well knows, who I am tender to. Tender only to one. Last petal's latest breath. Cries out aloud from his icy shroud his name. His name is Death. [BLOWING RASPBERRY] [IN SINGSONG] Sherry! What's that? -I've poured the sherry. -Oh, just coming. Oh, how lovely. Nothing nicer. Well, not much. [LAUGHS] [CLEARS THROAT] There was once a woman called Miss Hogmanimy, which is certainly a name you'd want to get married out of. She had a bright smile, a highly polished face, an un-provocative blouse, and was terribly wrought up over B-A-B-I-E-S, and the way they are born. And she gave up her whole life to going around giving free lectures, complete with lantern slides, to young girls of school, or school-leaving age. She had a most unusual way of talking, I remember. As though she had lost all her puff in an uphill climb. A sort of breathless whisper. You're talking about that Miss, um, what's-her-name. -Hogmanimy. -That stupid woman. All that nonsense she used to talk. Oh, her heart was in the right place. Stuff and nonsense. Where's me sherry? -Here. -Oh, thanks. I don't hold with such things. You should have stayed at home. But of course, I didn't. I went along to the School Chapel with the rest of the senior girls, eager to know exactly what happened. Yes, I can see it all. Giggling and laughing and carrying on. 14-year-old, why do you giggle and dote? 14-year-old, why are you such a goat? I'm 14 years old, that is the reason. -I giggle and dote in season. -Hmm. People like Miss Thingummy do more harm than good, if you ask me. Oh, what nice sherry. -It's Tio Pepe. -Oh, very nice. Hmm. Well, to listen to Miss Hogmanimy you'd think knowing how B-A-B-I-E-S are born was enough to solve all the problems of adolescence. She kept on about how beautiful it all is. She used to draw sections on the blackboard and then stand her stout body in front of them blushing furiously. And the upshot of it was, she wanted us to sign a paper promising that we would never drink anything but ginger beer and cola -and allied liquids. -Hmm. It would have been better off playing hockey. Mmm, poor woman. She tried hard, but her wits were fuddled. I came away from the lecture with a profound aversion to the whole subject and a vaguely sick feeling whenever I heard of friends or relatives about to produce offspring. I used to say a prayer for them and wash my hands off it. At the same time, I had plenty of deep down hopes that I wouldn't end up intacta, like those depressed females who never got asked, never got the chance, and went around reeking of their unholy continence. As I grew older I guessed copulation must be first class fun, but I'd no idea how one set about it. Or indeed how one found a suitable mate. [LAUGHS] Just like that girl in the paper. What girl? -Didn't I tell you? -No. -Oh, I'm sure I told you. -Not a word. Well, this girl wrote to the paper and said she'd seen a young man at the tennis club she'd joined. So as to not feel lonely, and to get herself fixed up with a house, or a flat, and a baby. Anyway this young man would do, she thought, he was all right. The question was, how could she get him to propose? They hadn't actually spoken, you see. So how could she make him propose? Well, they published an answer and they said, "Arrange to play the last set with him, "then linger hopefully and perhaps he will see you home." Oh, what a wonderful phrase, "Linger hopefully!" "Linger hopefully "and perhaps he will see you home." [LAUGHS] Can't you just see it? Up and down the suburbs, up and down the provincial towns, up and down India and Singapore and Shanghai? There are girls who have arranged to play the last set and are... [TOGETHER] Lingering hopefully! [BOTH LAUGHING] Oh, well, thank God those days are over. No more hopeful lingering for me. Well, it wasn't all hopeful lingering, as I recall. There was quite a bit of sitting up in the bath, crying your eyes out over some boy or another. Oh, that was Freddy, he comes later. -Karl was first. -Karl? Don't you remember Karl? He arrived one Christmas Day with a potted plant for you and a two volume translation of Faust for me. Oh, what a dreadful translation it was. I'll just go and look at the meat. -Best end of neck. -Oh. Feeling hungry, Peggy dear? -Yes, I am rather. -Good girl. Dear, oh, dear. That Geranium isn't very happy. Hmm. I'll give it a drink of water. At the foot of the Duke of York steps Karl said, "I love you, Stevie." It was December. There was snow on the ground. "I love you, Stevie." [CHUCKLES] Oh, my sweet Karl. I can see you now, with all of the with all of sleeping happily dreaming Germany in your blue eyes. A student of philosophy at the University of Berlin. [SPEAKS IN GERMAN] Later we went for a walk in the country. We walked in the rain, along a country road. There was a dead vole lying on the ground, with its paws sticking upright, like a Christian. Now vole art dead and done is all thy bleeding. We went up the path to this forlorn-looking empty house. Inside there was a musty smell reminiscent of murder, suicide, and avarice. We found some dusty sacking and lay down in each other's arms. "I love you, Stevie." He loved me, but he didn't like the English. I loved him, but didn't like the Germans. "The Germans are neurotic," I said, "and weak. "Oh, look at Berlin, swarming with uniforms and Swastikas. "And they are cruel with a vicious cruelty. "Not battle cruelty, but of doing-people-to-death- in-lavatories cruelty. "How evil is Germany today?" And so we quarreled. And so we parted. It won't be long now. -Time for another sherry? -Yes, please. You're smoking too much, Peggy. It's bad for you. Bad for your tubes. [BOTH COUGH] Yes, that's what I mean. Lion Aunt always calls me Peggy, never Stevie. Well, what's wrong with the name you were christened with, I'd like to know? -Nothing's wrong with it. -Well, then? Stevie began as a joke, really. Someone saw me out riding and thought I looked like Steve Donoghue, the jockey. Steve became Stevie, and it stuck. Peggy you were christened and Peggy you shall remain. Hmm. -Where's my paper? -Oh, it's probably behind your cushion. Hmm. After I left school, I went to Mrs. Hoster's famous Secretarial College, and then I got a job with Newnes, the publishers. I've been there almost the whole of my so called ha-ha working life. I find all this capitalism's toil very difficult and very exasperating. Well, my employers are kindly people. They never complain about my writing during office hours. Actually I have grown rather fond of my boss. Hmm. He has a very dry sense of humor. I remember once telling him about an article I'd read in a newspaper which said there was three million four hundred and twenty one thousand five hundred and thirty three illegitimate children in the United Kingdom. "Hoorah," he cried. "Who says England's going pansy?" [LAUGHS] -Say what you like, I always thought you'd marry Freddy. -What? AUNT: I can't think why you didn't. What on earth are you talking about? And don't try and shut me up. I wasn't the only one after all. Not the only one what? Person who thought you'd marry Freddy. Oh, marriage, marriage. Always this talk of marriage. Ha! You made a fine old fuss when he went away. -That's not the point. -What is, then? I'm not the marrying kind. I never have been. Well, you got engaged to him fast enough. I shifted my mother's ring onto my engagement finger. -That's all. It was a game. Just a game. -Nonsense. I am a friendship girl, not the marrying kind. -Stuff and nonsense. -It's true. The very thought of marriage makes me nervous. It frightens me. I've never heard such rubbish in all my life. Oh, she doesn't understand. She never has. It is pointless trying to explain. I may look like a pocket Hercules, ha-ha, but I am dreadfully low on energy. And a tired person like me can't respond to love. Either it wears her out and she'd rather be dead, or else she sees it as a last desperate chance clutch on a hencoop in mid-Atlantic. Oh! Oh, the fights and ecstasies of the spirit and the sad pursuing bones. I'll just go and prod the joint. Mint sauce or red currant jelly? I don't mind. I thought you preferred red currant. I bought some specially. I really don't mind. You choose. Eh, you are a difficult girl sometimes. Eh, you are a difficult girl sometimes. Anyone for tennis? Freddy, dear, how nice to see you. -Hello, Stevie. -I thought you had a match this afternoon. Rained off. Damn shame. I was raring to go. Come and sit down, dear. Oh, what a pleasant surprise. How are you, Miss Spear? Keeping well? Oh, yes, I mustn't grumble. Well, I do. But I shouldn't. You know how it is. I do indeed. I do indeed. Well, how are your parents, Freddy? Not too bad, all things considered. Dad's rheumatism's been playing up a bit. They always make me feel very welcome in Freddy's house. Such kind, solid people. I'm often invited in for tea after walks, eh. There's his kind mother and scones for tea. And then they draw their their chairs up to the fire and there's a lot of talk about how awfully common the other people in Palmers Green are. How they eat their dinners in the kitchen and sit in their shirt sleeves. Suburbs people are always ashamed of being suburbs people. They are always having to prove that they are not like the others. Oh, no. They're not like that. Oh, no. Not like that. They went up to town last week with the, eh, Wentworths. -You know the Wentworths? -Yes, of course. They saw the new, um, Jack Buchanan show. Very good they said. -Dinner at the Troc afterwards. Very jolly. -[LAUGHS] Eh, the Wentworth girl's getting married, isn't she? That's right. Next month. Such a pretty girl. I can't think why she wasn't married years ago. -Have you seen today's paper, Freddy? -FREDDY: No, Miss Spear. People in Palmers Green have an idea. Well, the unmarried girls have an idea, that if only they were married it'd be all right. And the married women think, "Well, now I'm married, so it is all right." Well, sometimes of course it is all right. But sometimes they have to work very hard saying all the time, "Well, now I'm married, so it's all right. "And Miss So-and-So isn't married, and that's not all right." And the unmarried girls are getting quite desperate. Oh, yes, they are. Getting quite desperate. They keep saying over and over, "If only I was married. If only I was married." It's like the refrain in The Three Sisters. It is the leitmotiv of all their lives. It is their Moscow. They're having a bit of a do on Saturday. A tennis club do, you know, drinks and so on. -Oh, are you going? -We're both going. -Are we? -Well, yes. I took it for granted. But you shouldn't take things for granted like that. Why on earth not? You're engaged after all. He'll have my heart. If not by gift, his knife shall carve it out. He'll have my heart, my life. I'll just go and prod the joint. Mint sauce or red currant jelly? Don't mind. I thought you preferred red currant. I bought some specially. I really don't mind. You choose. Eh, you're a difficult girl sometimes. -Pleased to see me? -Oh, of course. Pity about this damn rain. I felt like a biff this afternoon. Mmm. -Nice apples. -[LAUGHS] -Give us a kiss and say you love me. -Oh, not now. -Well, she's in the kitchen. She can't see us. -Your mouth is full of apple. -All gone. -[LAUGHS] No, Freddy please. -What's the matter? -Nothing. You're in one of your moods. I'm not in any sort of mood. Is it because of... Is it because of last night? Is it? You agreed. You said yes. I didn't make you do it. Did I? -Well, what's wrong, then? -Nothing. Don't be daft. Something's wrong. What is it? Don't sulk. Tell me. [SIGHS] Why did you ask if I was enjoying it? -What? -Right in the middle, right in the middle of everything, you said, "Are you enjoying it?" -Did I? -"Are you enjoying it, dear?" Oh. Well, I'm sorry. Sorry, I didn't mean to offend. -Don't say that. -Don't say what? -I'm not offended. -Well, what then? Well, it's so typical. Don't you see? It's so suburban. Well, I am suburban. So are you. Oh, come on, Stevie. -It's nothing to get upset about. -I'm not upset. I'm frightened. -Frightened of old Freddy? -No. Of marriage. Don't be such a chump. It's true. If I'm going to be a wife, I want to be a good wife, and I don't think I'm up to it. It's my tubercular glands. I don't have the stamina. That's just an excuse. Don't you love me anymore? Part of me does. Oh, well, thanks very much. Of course I love you. You're so strong and safe and comforting. It's only... What? Well, if we get married, I won't be Stevie anymore. I'll be Mrs. Freddy. That's what frightens me. Well, it's the same for any other girl. I am not "any other girl," I'm me. You take so much for granted. -Like what? -I don't know. Everything. You expect me to behave a certain way, think a certain way, lead a certain kind of life. I don't think I'm up to it. I don't think I want to. I'm a friendship girl, you see? The rhythm of friendship is strong in my blood. I must go, I must come back. Here I am again. Now I am going. I love people, but I love the thought and memory of them just as much. There comes a time when I have to go away and then there comes a time when I have to come back. It's a friendship rhythm. I am not the marrying kind. Don't you understand? -Not a word. -Oh. I don't know what the hell you're talking about. If only we could be friends. Friends? What do you mean friends? Grow up, Stevie. -Grow up? -Yes, grow up. You're like a child. Living with your aunt. Cossetted night and day. That's not a proper way of life for anyone. And don't start all that nose-in-the-air arty-bohemian nonsense. You know it doesn't wash with me. Oh, Freddy, how can we? How can we marry? It would be utterly foolish, utterly suicidal. You don't mean that. Well, I do. I see. Very well, if that's what you think. Don't you? Honestly, don't you? Well, it could work. If you changed, it could work. Why me? Why must I change? Well, you'll have to, sooner or later, heavens above. I mean, grown people don't spend their lives in a cocoon, writing poems with an old maid aunt. I don't like change. Well, then you'll be lonely. All right then, I'll be lonely. And you'll die alone, you'll deserve to. Little pets like you deserve to be lonely. Go to hell. Go to hell yourself. Go to hell! [DOOR SLAMS] FREDDY: Go to hell yourself. It's like escaping from a sunk submarine. You must stand absolutely still and without panic until the flood-waters have covered your shoulders and are creeping up towards your mouth. Only then, when your escape-room is flooded to drowning point, can you shoot up through the escape-funnel, up and away, and it's over. But when it's over, then it's tearing inside, it's... Tearing in the belly, and you wish you were dead, and had never been born. After Freddy left, I ran a very hot bath and just sat there, the tears dripping down my cheeks. I just sat there, my fringe all cock-awry, and the tears dripping down my cheeks into the hot water. It was as though the world had come to a sad, despairing, tearful end. But of course, it hadn't. Oh, one does things. One goes to see friends, one does one's work, one fusses with this and that. Kind friends tell you time is the only doctor, and it's true. But he's a slow worker, that time, and no anaesthetist at all. Suddenly you've lost everything, and the hours are long, and only a thousand hours will help to heal. Would he might come again and I upon his breast again might lie. Would I had not in foolish wrath driven him ever from my path. Would the sun the day's course over might that same day's lost dawn recover. As vain as this, vain prayers are all vain prayers that would past days recall. Never shall sun now sunk away rise up again on yesterday. Never shall love untimely slain rise from the grave and live again. And so one is left... Bitter, resentful, lonely... With this sadness deficiency feeling. I tend to think a great many people carry this feeling around with them all their lives. A lot of people pretend, out of bravery, I suppose, that they're quite ordinary, rather dull chaps. But really, they don't feel at all at home in the world. They don't make friends easily. Oh, they laugh a lot and joke, and their chums think they're quite all right and jolly nice, too. But sometimes they get so tired. The brave pretense breaks down and then they are lost. I wrote a poem about this once. I got the idea from a newspaper report about a man... Drowning. [MELANCHOLY MUSIC] Nobody heard him, the dead man. But still he lay moaning. I was much further out than you thought and not waving, but drowning. Poor chap, he always loved larking. And now he's dead. It must have been too cold for him. "His heart gave way," they said. Oh, no, no, no. It was too cold always. Still the dead one lay moaning. I was much too far out all my life and not waving, but drowning. Thank you so much. Bye-bye. Drive carefully. Thank you so much. [LAUGHS] Oh, it's the wrong house. Oh, dear-oh-dear parties! I do love them, but really, so tiring. By the time I've got myself ready, I'm totally exhausted and I arrive looking like the sheeted dead. "'Miss Stevie Smith," they call, and in I walk, the sheeted dead. AUNT: Peggy? Yes, it's me. I'm back. And I never know what to do with my hands. I keep thinking, "What shall I do with my hands?" Plus the ghastly business of having to find the bathroom. Whenever I'm excited, I have to dash straight for the bathroom. Nervous enteritis, they call it. Straight for the bathroom. It's so embarrassing. Especially with strangers. AUNT: Peggy, is that you? Yes, it's me. The Lion Aunt has become a dreadful worrier. She worries about everything these days. She doesn't go out much either. Well, hardly at all. She thinks the house stood so much during the war that now it mustn't be left. I know how she feels. It certainly stood an awful lot. The blitz, the doodle bugs. Ooh, the V-2s. The Home Guard used to practice in the park, I remember, and we had a searchlight unit by the allotments. Hey ho. What a time it was though. The war, I mean. My word, yes. There were some people called Rackstraws, I remember. I've been calling and calling. Oh, I thought you were just saying hello. Look at this. Another letter from those Income Tax devils. You hid it in the fruit bowl. I don't suppose it's very important. Well, it looks important. On Her Majesty's Service. Mmm. What does it say? -I don't know. I haven't opened it. -Why not? I was waiting for you. Oh, I... What are you drinking? Brandy. Do you want some? No. No. I'll have a cup of tea. -Oh, I'll get it, shall I? -No, no, no. You stay where you are. I'll get it. -How was the party? -Oh, very jolly. Good. She's getting old. Becoming an old lady. I must be careful not to give the wrong impression. About being middle class, I mean. Suburbs people are extremely class-conscious and I don't approve of that. Oh, no. I was once in this terribly refined teashop in Evesham, when this poor, dirty old man came shuffling in. Well, he'd obviously made a mistake. He didn't realize how refined this teashop was. The tea shop lady was very snooty. This English woman is so refined. She has no bosom and no behind. She took the old man very gingerly by the coat sleeve and led him to the door. She wasn't going to have him there. Oh, no, that wouldn't do at all. The poor old man went shuffling out, drips falling from his damp nose, and as he went he said, "It's a fucking stuck up tea shop." I sometimes think it's a fucking stuck-up world. And it's the middle classes, I'm afraid, who are the worst offenders. Oh, yes. They are the ones who fight to the last ditch for the public schools and the privilege idea, because they think they are so nearly about to grasp it for themselves, so nearly about to send their kids to Eton. Never a thought for the kids, mind you. Never a thought for the kiddo's welfare. Parents who barely can afford it should not send their children to public schools. Ill will reward it. [GLASS BREAKING] Are you all right? What happened? I broke a plate. So I see. [LAUGHS] Come on, give it to me. I'll do it. -[CLICKING TONGUE] -[LAUGHING] I found a bit of game pie in the larder. I thought you were going to have a cup of tea. -What? -You said you were going to make yourself a pot of tea. -Did I? -Mmm. I changed me mind. Ah. She keeps forgetting things. -What? -Nothing. Look at it, Peggy. Just look at it. "Do you make any repayment claims?" -Well, do I? -Let me see. Oh, no. They've obviously made a mistake. They think you're a man. -A man? -Well, they've called you "Esquire". -Disgraceful. -I shouldn't worry about it. If cousin James was alive, I'd get him onto this. -Ignore it. -He'd have known what to do. Cousin James. He was one of the high-ups in Somerset House. Very clever, very conscientious, rather severe, a socialist of the Huxley-antimacassar period, when it was the acme of a man's rights to work 12 hours a day, go to night school free for another six, and then sleep for six hours on as hard a bed as could be found. He'd have sorted this out. Yes, he probably would. He was always taking up the legal cudgels on her behalf. Where's the writing paper? Well, it's on the desk, but don't do it now. Do it in the morning. Never put off till tomorrow what you can do today. I shall please meself what I do. I won't be bossed about by anybody. What was I going to say? Oh, the Rackstraw's dog. It was during the war, you see, and these people, the Rackstraws, they lived nearby. They gave their dog to the army to be trained for front line service. But for some reason or another, maybe it was one dog too many for them, this dog was sent back home. Well, after his training was complete, he was sent back home. The only trouble was he had been taught fierce ways. He'd been taught again his wolf behavior. He'd been taught to fight and bite. So when his fond master went down the garden path to meet him, the dog bared his fangs, leapt up and tried to bite the throat of his loving friend. So the man clubbed him down with his heavy stick. So the dog died, and they buried him in the back garden. On his gravestone they wrote, "He died for King and Country." AUNT: Peggy dear, I forgot the milk. Yes, it's here. Peggy! Yes, I'll bring it. For most of her life, Stevie followed an unchanging routine. Every morning she caught the train to her office near the Strand, and every evening she traveled back to Palmer Green, to Avondale Road, and to the Lion Aunt. "Life is like a railway station," Stevie said. One day they brought her home early, in great distress. Her wrists were bandaged. She took the knife. Its cruel edge would bite into her flesh. Had she the resolution or the art to bear the smart and drive it to her heart? Death, that sweet and gentle friend, failed to respond to her summons. Life continued. [PANTING] Peggy. -Peggy. -STEVIE: Coming. Oh, tarnation, take it. Peggy what are you doing? Peggy? Here we are. A nice ham salad. My soppy blanket's on the floor. So I see. Come on. Oh... Let's tuck you in. -There we are. How is that? Hmm? -That's better. There's a special treat for pudding. -What? -Eat your salad first. [LAUGHS] What is it, Peggy? A special treat, but eat that first. [LAUGHS] Oh, she can't do much these days, poor darling. So it's up to me to run the house. She abdicated with great reluctance, as you can imagine. Now that I'm leading a domestic sort of life, I'd rather do the washing up than write. Housework is the most marvelous excuse for not doing anything else. I mean clearing up a room, throwing everything away. It's marvelous. Then I feel so tired I go to sleep all afternoon. I love going out and buying the food and stripping bits off and hacking it up. It's the most wonderful way of getting rid of aggression. And then, if I write, I write in the back room after tea. It's a nice room with a good view of the garden, and of the birds. Is everything all right? Lovely dear, thank you. Dearest Lion Aunt. I will never leave you, darling, to be eaten by the starling. For I love you more than ever in the wet and stormy weather. -Tasty ham. -It's York. Yes, I thought so. Very tasty. Junket's her favorite. Stevie's special junket. When it's set, I grate nutmeg all over the top and then I add a tablespoon of whisky, or brandy. It's really delicious. It was a house of female habitation. Two ladies fair inhabited the house, and they were brave. For although fear knocked loud upon the door, and said he must come in, they did not let him in. Huh. And so we passed our days. Cooking, housework, writing, the occasional glass of sherry. [LAUGHING] I've, eh, retired now of course. Oh, I retired early. Oh, it is so wonderful not having to go to the office every day. I wasn't cut out for the business world. I never fitted in. Oh, I've forgotten to feed the birds, oh. Oh, Peggy dear. Oh. [WHISTLING] Lunchtime. Lovely bacon rind. Meal-o. [BIRDS CHIRPING] No, I never fitted in. Like the little boy in the commercial class who was told to try his hand at business correspondence. He wrote, "Sadly we see our customers falling away. "But I hope we shall always be friends. "And so with love." They soon put him right. Oh, yes. He was soon corrected, but never me. Never Stevie. I was always slightly out of step. I sometimes think perhaps I should have been a pirate. A North Sea pirate. Well, we're all seafaring men in our family. After all even my poor father. Oh, but it was good for me. The office routine. Mmm. I needed the discipline. If I'd never had to work for my living, I would have ended up some invalidish sort of person, never done any writing. It was exile from domesticity that produced my poems and I enjoyed a lot of it, too. I loved the stock exchange language with its vaguely religious undertones. [CHANTING] Conversion redemption pegged at 60. [LAUGHS] Marvelous. And it wasn't a taxing job either. I used to sit in my tiny office, writing my books and my poems, inviting my friends round for tea and hot buttered toast. My boss never complained, never. Never so much as gave me a reproachful glance. He was very kind. Dear Sir Frank. I can see him now walking past my office door in dark, dark mourning clothes and dark, dark top hat. He was forever going to funerals. "Another good man buried," he'd say and walk on with somber tread. There's not much to say about the, eh, suicide business, It's something I'd rather forget. Too much pain. Too much remorse. Not because of the act itself, not just because of the act itself, but because of the pain it inflicted on other people. Aunt, Sir Frank, my friends at the office. It shouldn't have happened there, not there. Poor Sir Frank was dreadfully upset, but not surprised. I doubt very much whether he was greatly surprised. "I'm rather disturbed about this death feeling in your poems, Stevie," he said. He knew. Oh, yes. He knew. I've finished. Peggy, I've finished. -Peggy. -What? It's all gone. Every mouthful. Oh, that is splendid. Now for pudding. Junket! What a treat. And some cream to go with it. Oh, how kind of you, Peggy. Oh, you have been a busy girl. [BOTH LAUGH] Yes, I do seem to be frightfully busy these days. Ooh, I've a lot of darling friends and I'm pretty freely entertained. I'm forever dashing off to brasserie, bar, club and pub. And sometimes when Aunt's feeling well enough to cope on her own, I go week-ending in the country. I love it when people ask me back. "Do come again, Stevie," they say. I think they are the best words of all. "Do come again." -This is delicious, Peggy. -Good. Oh, what a lovely lunch. Ooh. Lovely lunches follow lovely breakfasts, and at night it's "God bless. Happy dreams." Nothing changes. Hey ho. The other day, I came across a copy of King Solomon's Mines, which I had been given as a Sunday School prize. And on the paper cover at the back of the book, I could still make out my childish handwriting, "Florence Margaret Smith, "Avondale Road, Palmers Green, North London, "England, Northwest Europe." BOTH: "The World." [LAUGHING] Yes, I remember it, Peggy. Well, I'm still here and so is Palmers Green. Mind you, it's a very large bustling place these days. And in a social sense I suppose it has gone down. But it's still the same high lying suburb it ever was. The top of our hill is the highest point between here and the Ural mountains, or so they say. -So it is. -It is. It is. It is. It is. And it's still a very active place. We have our Art Circle, Shakespeare Reading Society, Players' Guild, the Library Discussion Group, tennis clubs, croquet clubs, riding clubs, swimming clubs, and branches of the Labor party, Liberal party, Communist party and Primrose League. We also have our fair share of intellectual revolutionaries. These people regard the middle-classes as obstructionalist box dwellers whose only thought is for themselves and for their families. As if that were not the common thought of the greater part of mankind. They are the salt of the earth, these free-blowing revolutionaries. But it's wise to remember you can't live on a diet of salt alone. Of course, things have changed, and there are things I miss. The lantern lectures in the parish hall, and those dark, mysterious wonderful woods, where trespassers were forbidden, which is now a housing estate. And especially those brightly painted advertisements that used to decorate the walls on our Swiss-chalet railway station. The Pickwick, the Owl and the Waverley pen, they come as a boon and a blessing to men. [SNORING] [HUMMING] She used to be such a brisk managing person. And now she sleeps her life away. There is little laughter where you are going and no warmth. In that harsh landscape of winter where rivers are frozen and the only sound is the crash of winter tree-branches. [CLEARS THROAT] I don't mind much about survival myself. I mean, supposing we had to go on forever, how awful. Without death, I don't think we could possibly endure life. It's an escape from pain of course. It's also an escape from pleasure too prolonged. It's rather like being drawn into a race of water before it gets to the waterfall. It gets quicker and quicker and more and more exciting, and the older you get, the more exciting it becomes. I don't know why people are taught that death is such a calamity. I think he must be rather a dish. Anyway we've all got to go sometime. Soon be time for a glass of sherry. I think of myself as an Anglican agnostic, if such a thing is possible. I was brought up an Anglican. I still like it very much. I love the hymns. I just don't believe it anymore. I reject the comfort and sweetness of Christianity, because I don't think it's true. And it's cruel. Hideously cruel. Is it not interesting to see how the Christians continually try to separate themselves in vain from the doctrine of eternal pain. They cannot do it. They are committed to it. Their Lord said it, they must believe it. And so the vulnerable body is stretched without pity on flames forever. Is this not pretty? The religion of Christianity is mixed of sweetness and cruelty. Reject this sweetness, for she wears a smoky dress out of hell fires. Who makes a God? Who shows him thus? It is the Christian religion does. Oh, oh. Have none of it. Blow it away, have done with it. This God the Christians show... Out with him, out with him, let him go. [SIGHS] I suppose it's because we are lonely, because man is so lonely, we invent God. I think we should just accept loneliness. Not make a theology out of it. If I had been the Virgin Mary, I would have said, "No. "No, I'll have no part of it. "No savior, no world to come, nothing." Peggy. Some water, Peggy. Here we are. Some more? No, thank you. People think because I never married I know nothing about the emotions. They are wrong. I loved my aunt. I first met Stevie shortly after the war. Well, it must have been a little longer than that, a little longer than shortly. And it must have been at one of those quasi-bohemian gatherings to celebrate somebody's book, somebody's exhibition, somebody's first night, or somebody's something. I was wondering how much longer I could put up with all that shrill chatter and cigarette smoke when I saw a strange looking creature hiding in a corner, drinking gallons of gin with verve. I went across and introduced myself and she gave me what can only be described as a radiant smile and told me her name was Stevie Smith. [SINGING INDISTINCTLY] [LAUGHS] I knew her work, of course, and admired its quirky individuality. We had one of those brief shouting cocktail party conversations. Mostly about George Orwell, who used to be her producer at the BBC. "He keeps lying to me," she said. "I'm bored to death with all the lies." After a while she asked me if I'd give her a lift to Palmer's Green. It seemed rather a long way out of the way, but I was grateful for the chance to escape. I soon learnt that she expected all her car-owning friends to ferry her about, no matter how inconvenient it might be. God knows how many trips I've made on her behalf through the beggarly purlieus of north London. [LAUGHING] [SIGHS] [HUMMING] These tiresome duties have now reached a peak with Stevie becoming something of a star turn on the poetry reading circuit, which means a lot of traveling for Stevie, and a certain amount of nervous exhaustion for her car-owning friends. Even so, my affection for her has remained unimpaired... Relatively. [DOORBELL RINGING] Why, in a crisis, are ones coat sleeves always inside out? -Let me help. -No. No. No. I can manage. I think. There. Well, how do I look? Very nice. That means you hate it. -Not at all, it's very striking. -I dyed it myself. So I see. "Caribbean Blue" it said on the packet. It looks more greenish to me. What do you think? Well, it's a bit patchy, Stevie. Er, just a bit uneven. Oh, that won't matter. They'll think it's all part of the pattern. With my looks, I'm bound to look simple or fast. I would rather look simple. -Mmm. -Anyway it's warm, that's the main thing. These school halls are always so drafty. -You should have worn trousers. -[LAUGHS] Not me, darling. Never trousers. Never trousers on principle. Did I tell you about that? -Tell me about what? -Well, this Colonel I met at a hotel somewhere. Colonel Peck, I think he was called. I could have hugged him. There was this lady, you see. This large English lady who always wore trousers on principle, as she told us one morning at breakfast. "And a pretty fat principle it is, too," said the Colonel. I could have hugged him. [LAUGHS] There you are. I knew you were hiding somewhere. Oh, dear, what a fright. Ooh, I look a bit below par, don't I? Two gins below par to be precise. Just like that ghastly photograph. What ghastly photograph? I showed it to you last week. The one that makes me look as though I've been dead and buried. I don't mind looking old. I do have a thing about looking dead and buried. Brooch or necklace, which do you prefer? Either. You look charming in either. Don't be so boring. Tell me what you think. Well, I think we ought to go. It's gone half past. Oh, not yet, surely. They said it would only take two hours. MAN: We should allow three. Two hours maximum they said on the telephone. Well, if the traffic gets bad at this time of day. Oh. Oh, well, we can't go yet. I haven't packed a bag. Bag? You don't need a bag. Oh, I thought I would take an overnight bag. -What on earth for? -STEVIE: Just in case. Just to be on the safe side. But we're driving straight back. That's why I'm here. We're driving straight back after the reading. Yes, but you never know darling, someone might ask us to stay. Who? Who? Well, I don't know, but people do sometimes. It is possible. -I've got a meeting in the morning. -Oh. Oh, well, then you drive straight back. I'm not stopping you. Meaning you'll stay? Well, of course, if I'm asked. It would be fun to have a party. London is so dull. One never meets other writers. Not like France. Poets and writers don't sit in pavement cafes, not like Paris. Well, of course the pavements are so awfully cold, and you can't just go up to someone and say, "I'm a poet and you're a poet, so I'm coming to dinner next Thursday." -Stevie, this is ridiculous. -What is? If you're staying the night, you could have caught a train. I didn't say I was staying. I said I would like to. -It's a bloody awful drive. -You said it wasn't. A hundred miles up and a hundred miles back. -Oh, well you offered. -You asked. You could have said no. Look, I'm only driving up, because there's no train back tonight. Yes and I'm very grateful. I said I was very grateful. I don't know what else I can say. Then why all this talk about staying overnight? I only mentioned it as a possibility. You should have told me before. I won't ask you again, don't worry. Never again. Never, never, never more. Quoth the Raven. -What are you doing now? -Having a drink. What does it look like? I think it's very unkind of you carrying on like this. How was I to know you had to be back first thing in the morning? I don't know you go to meetings and things like that. -It's most upsetting. -All right, I'm sorry, Stevie. -Let's stop this bickering, shall we? -I'm not bickering. Well, let's get on then, or we'll never get there at all. Well, I'm ready. I was ready ten minutes ago. I thought you wanted to pack a bag. There's not much point, is there, if we're driving straight back? -Oh, I must get the food. -What food? I bought some sausage rolls. I thought we'd enjoy a snack. Er, we could take the glasses. Have a drop of gin. Dear darling Stevie. She needed to be cherished. She needed to be lapped in loving care. In the midst of so much love and such comfort, still to feel unsafe and be afraid. How one's heart goes out to you. I remember once sitting at the back of a cheerless school hall while Stevie pranced around the stage, chanting her poems like an elderly Shirley Temple. It should have been embarrassing, but it wasn't. It was touching. Truthful and haunting. And the children were enthralled. She spoke to them directly, you see. From child to child. From heart to heart. Thought you were in a hurry. [CHUCKLES] Coming, Stevie. Don't forget the gin. I've got a bad leg. What a bore. Oh, it was really awful. I was supposed to do this broadcast for the BBC and I told them about the leg quite casually, you know. Well, they sent a car for me and a rug. All I needed was a shawl and a hot water bottle to complete the picture. [SIGHS] Oh, hmm. Everything has its compensations, I suppose. [SIGHS] Even growing old. Of course I miss Aunt dreadfully. When you've lived with an old lady from an early age, you never cease to be a child. Now she's gone and I find I'm old myself. Some people thought I should move. "Why don't you get a flat in London?" they said. But I didn't want to. I didn't want to leave Avondale Road. Everyone is so kind to me here. I'm better off in Palmer's Green. And I've got used to living alone. And there is something wonderfully dreamy about being in a house all by yourself. Ooh, you can wander about, sleep in a different room every night if you want to. And then if I feel tired, I just stay in bed. I rather enjoy it. I rather enjoy feeling very tired. Some days are long and thin and there is nothing in them. But they speed past just the same. And suddenly you realize how short it all is. Life... And at the end there is death, with the pleasure of certainty. I read a lot these days. I read more than ever. Gibbon especially. Decline and Fallis my favorite. I never tire of it. I like Agatha Christie, too. I love reading her in French. She is so wonderfully funny. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] I think she's a genius. [SPEAKING IN FRENCH] Her murders are so polite. Oddly enough, life has suddenly become rather exciting. Ooh, I'm quite a celebrity these days. I've been photographed for the newspapers, I've been interviewed for the television, I've made gramophone records, I've lectured. I've even had my portrait painted. Mind you, it didn't look much like me. Well, I didn't think so. The coloring was lovely, but the lower half of the face seemed to belong to someone else. To Disraeli, I think. Do take Muriel out. She is looking so glum. Do take Muriel out. All her friends are gone. [IN SING-SONG] All her friends are gone. And she's alone. And she looks for them where they have never been. And her peace is flown. Do take Muriel out. Although your name is Death. She will not complain. When you dance her over the blasted heath. Hmm. The most exciting thing of all was getting the Queen's Gold Medal for Poetry. This was a tremendous honor and I was tremendously pleased about it and very flattered, too. It used to be sent by post, I believe, but Cecil changed all that when he became Poet Laureate, and quite right, too. Just imagine getting a Gold Medal from the Queen among all those gas bills and postcards from Felixstowe. "Anything in the post today, dear?" "Just a medal from the Queen. " "Ugh." Anyway, they told me to get to Buckingham Palace at such and such a time, and of course I was terrified of being late. I'm always late for everything. I had a fortifying drink at the Ritz and then walked through the rain to the Palace, and got there dreadfully early. Well, they were still in the middle of Changing the Guard. So what to do? The only thing I could think of was to go next door to the Queen's Gallery. I bought a lot of postcards, da Vinci drawings, which I then had to cram into my handbag, which is not very big, as you can see. So there I was, with a handbag crammed full of postcards, standing in the rain outside Buckingham Palace. I went up to one of the policemen and said, "I am supposed to be in there, you know. "I have an appointment with Her Majesty to get this medal." To my surprise he knew all about it. So in I went, into the Palace. I was met by a rather decorative young man in naval uniform, and he took me to this outer room. Oh, what is it called? Oh, anyway it's a huge room and there was this lady-in-waiting, a most agreeable girl. We had a very giggly time. She asked me to do one of my poems. So l hissed a short one under my breath. Well, you know, the one about the poor debutante all alone at the grand ball. Well, it seemed appropriate, I thought. I cannot imagine anything nicer than to be struck by lightening and killed suddenly crossing a field. As if somebody cared. Nobody cares whether I am alive or dead. Oh, yes. We had a very jolly time. I loved that part of it. And then, the one before me came out. A staggering looking woman. And I thought, "Oh, heavens, I'm not properly dressed for this." I bought this hat at a jumble sale, you see. Only five shillings. A tremendous bargain, but, perhaps a bit of a mistake. Oh, anyway. The young naval man takes you to the door and there far, far away, the room's as big as Trafalgar Square, standing against the mantel piece, is this charming figure, the Queen. I'd never seen Royalty close to before. Well, only once before. I saw the Queen Mother at a Book Prints Exhibition. I was standing on the first floor landing and she walked below me. I could have poured sherry onto her hat. Well, there she was. There was the Queen. You curtsey at the door and then make your way across the room, and then she comes forward and smiles. She's got a very gracious smile. And hands you the medal. As she gave it to me, she said, "I don't know what you'll do with it." So I looked at it and I said, "Well, I could always have a hook put on it and wear it round my neck." "I don't know whether it's real," she said. "Oh!" I said. "Oh, I'm sure it is." Then she motioned me. I think that is the correct expression. She motioned me to sit down. There was a table between us. And they told me outside not to worry about when to come out, because she would ring a bell under the table. Well, the poor darling would keep asking me questions about poetry, and I got the impression it wasn't exactly her favorite subject. "How do you think of a poem?" she said. "Well," I said, "it just sort of comes to you. Often when you least expect it. "Right in the middle of hoovering, you know, you suddenly think of a poem." She made me feel very like a schoolgirl again, being interviewed by a rather cordial headmistress. After a bit I got nervous and said, "I don't know why I seem to have written a lot about murder lately." Oh, this was obviously the wrong thing to have said, because the Royal smile got rather fixed. When it's all over, you walk out backwards, curtsey at the door and then the young naval man gets a taxi for you. We went to the Epicure afterwards for a celebration lunch. Cecil Day Lewis, Eric Walter White from the Arts Council, and Norah Smallwood, my fire watching chum from Chatto's. Dear Eric ordered oysters, which was a great mistake. They were ages in coming. I had to ask the waiter for some bread and jam to stave off the pangs. And then back home to Avondale Road. [SIGHS] I did so wish the Lion Aunt could have been alive to see it. Perhaps she would have changed her mind about my writing. Perhaps not. Stuff and nonsense. Perhaps she was right. Hey ho. Ah. [SOMBER MUSIC] I have a friend at the end of the world. His name is a breath of fresh air. He is dressed in gray chiffon. At least I think it is chiffon. It has a peculiar look, like smoke. It wraps him around, it blows out of place. It conceals him. I have not seen his face, but I have seen his eyes. They are as pretty and bright as raindrops on black twigs in March. And heard him say, "I am a breath of fresh air for you. "A change, by and by." "Black March" I call him, because of his eyes being like March raindrops on black twigs. But this new friend, whatever new names I give him, is still an old friend. He says, "Whatever new names you give me, "I am a breath of fresh air, "a change for you." [SIGHS] Stevie's Sister Molly suffered a severe stroke, which left her virtually helpless. Anxious to do what she could, Stevie packed her bags, said goodbye to Avondale Road, and went to Devon where Molly lived. It was there that she fell ill. From Torbay Hospital she wrote to an old friend. STEVIE: "Dear John, "I am ill now, "so must stay down here until the doctors finish with me. "I keep having sort of fits, "mixed up with some poisoning down below. Ha-ha. "When the fits come I am almost unconscience. "With something coming upon me. "I cannot speak proper words, nor read them. "It is a frightful nightmare of bells ringing "and unknown crowds crying out advice. "Warnings etcetera, "which I cannot understand. "Or when sanity returns, "remember. "I am now with two doctors and must go at once to see a third, "who is a specialist, as soon as possible. "When the doctors have spent ages and ages, "and mornings and mornings and afternoons and afternoons, "dear stick with sticks, and glass tubes "and being rather sharp with steel rods, "then they will know what is the matter with me. "I don't suppose I shall be very bright, ha-ha, "as I cannot speech properly, "but I scramble velly, velly well. "Do... "Do... "Do forgive me, dear John, "if I have been already over and over this again and again. "I hope you are beautifully happy. "Love, Stevie." The doctors diagnosed a tumor on the brain. She lost the power of speech. Stevie was 69 when she wrote her final poem. Unable to speak, she scrawled a circle around one word. Death. I feel ill. What can the matter be? I'd ask God to pity me.
