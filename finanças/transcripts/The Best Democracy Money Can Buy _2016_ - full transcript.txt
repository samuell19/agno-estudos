Fuck you! Yeah, you pissed me off. You're a piece of shit, you know? Just like another white boy, white Southern boy trash, you know? You mother fucker! My name's Palast... Fuck you! Greg Palast. I'm an investigative reporter. I hunt billionaires who misbehave and every four years I become a crime reporter. The crime, election theft. I have election thieves, vote rustlers, ballot bandits. Investigative reporter Greg Palast wades through the dirty political tactics. It all begin in 2000 when a little birdie dropped off an envelope marked confidential. It was the secret list kept in Florida state computers that stole the election for George W. Bush. This is the story of the investigation of the theft of the 2016 election. It's a crime still in progress and a hunt for the very rich guys behind the crime. How are they gonna do it? I haven't a clue. Then one night in my shitty little New York City detective agency office on Second Avenue. And she found 35,500 people voted in North Carolina and voted in some other state. So you're talking about probably over a million people that voted twice in this election. Really? That voted twice in this election. Say what, Dick? The first concrete evidence we've ever had of massive voter fraud. We've talked about it ad nauseam, this proves it. I usually don't pay attention to a Fox News freak like Dick Morris but he was senior counsel to the president until he was caught calling the White House while a hooker sucked on his toes. Over a million people that voted twice in this election. A million double voters. Really, Dick? You vote twice, you get five years in the slammer. Voted in North Carolina and voted in some other state. What fool would listen to this wacky accusation. This voting system is out of control. You have people, in my opinion, that are voting many, many times. Say what, Donald? You have people, in my opinion, that are voting many, many times. That are voting many, many times, many, many times. Really, Donald? A double voting crime ring. Is there really a gigantic conspiracy of one million democrats to vote twice or is it a massive scheme to take away the votes of a million innocent people? There's only one way to find out. I have to get the list of these skanky alleged double voting fiends. So the next day, I call down to Carolina. If they really caught thousands of double voting criminals, I want their names. All I'm asking for is can we get a copy of the names? I'm requesting those names of the double voters. But I got the official screw you. This was a criminal investigation and it's all confidential. You've got a list of 35,500 suspects and the names are secret. You're telling me this list of bad guys, it's completely confidential? It's confidential. I tried Mississippi, Arizona, 28 states, same jive. Confidential, really? Confidential. It's confidential. No, you don't, don't, don't even say it. I put Ms. Badpenny and the entire team on it. Screw confidential, get me the lists. It took five months. What do you know? Our little birdie shmoozes some bureaucrat into turning over the confidential list we're not supposed to see. So here's their big secret. Interstate Crosscheck. Crosscheck? And here they are. The suspects, duplicate voters. Look at this, 7.2 million suspects in 29 states. A list of duplicate voters, if that's what they are. With a hit list this big, you can fix any election. You can steal the White House. Interstate Crosscheck, a list of seven millions voters. I've see lists like this before. The year was 2000. It was during that fight between George W. Bush and Al Gore. Before the election, Jeb Bush, governor of Florida, and his trusty secretary of state, Katherine Harris, hunted down convicts, convicted felons who had registered to vote and kicked them right off the voter rolls. We're talking killers, bank robbers, drug lords. They heroically removed the voting rights of an astonishing 94,000 Florida voters. Other states secretly joined in the great felon voter purge. My suspicions got me moving. I grabbed the plane, I have to see these ex-con voters for myself. I hopped around the country to investigate the supposed crime wave of ex-cons voting. But I couldn't find a single illegal voter. So I went to the big house. Do felon voters even exist? Here they are. Are any of you registered to vote? No, we're not allowed. I am. I'm a registered voter, I just have a misdemeanor. But I just couldn't find these criminal felon voters. Then an enveloped arrived on my desk. It was the list of those Florida murderers and mobsters who had registered to vote. Hmm, nothing matched up. The names of the voters didn't match up with the names of the felons. Jonathan Barber lost his vote because Vinnie Barbieri was convicted of a crime and Jonathan has a different birthday than Vinnie. Thousands of mismatched birthdays. Some of these criminals were convicted in the future, way in the future. And thousands never convicted at all. Something was wrong here. The voters that were purged just didn't match up with the felons. Turns out, the number of real criminals on Bush's felon list, zero, nada, bupkis. But look a this, bla, bla, bla. Bla, bla, bla, huh? Ah, most of the innocent folks who lost their vote were marked B-L-A, black, like this guy, Willie Steen. He lost his vote because some other guy named Willie O'Steen was convicted of a felony in Ohio. No criminal at all. Never been convicted of any crime. I never been arrested in my life. So I went to Katherine Harris' office to show her election's chief their phony little felon list. But suddenly, he had to go. And I think I'm done with this interview. Wait, well let me just show you the contract, if I could. It could look to other people that you paid four million dollars to purchase this election for the Republican Party. Mr. Roberts? After the state troopers took me away, his boss, Katherine Harris, pronounced Governor Jeb's brother president of the United States by just 537. But who cares? Does it really matter some politician shoplifts an election? ♪ Good times ♪ ♪ These are the good times ♪ ♪ Leave your cares behind ♪ I'm the guy who pulled the trigger. ♪ These are the good times ♪ ♪ Good times ♪ Does it matter? Yes, it does. Now, I got this new crosscheck list. A whole lot bigger than that list of fake felons. And crosscheck ain't just Florida, it's in 29 states, almost all republican controlled. Either this is the biggest voting crime wave in U.S. history or it's the biggest con since Dick Cheney took us on a little hunting trip to find weapons of mass destruction. Is this crosscheck list going to steal the 2016 election? I don't know. But to investigate would require my flying my ass down to Dixie and all over hell, forget it. I've been on the vote heist beat for 20 years, I'm done. I just had a quadruple bypass. My plan for the year involved nothing more than a hammock and a pina colada. Stop it, get to work. This is Lenny Badpenny, our chief investigatrix, punk rocker, stake-out svengali, detective extraordinaire. ♪ She cannot look at you ♪ ♪ And everybody looks at us ♪ ♪ She's a man ♪ Palast, you're going to North Carolina. Once we got way down south in Dixie, I headed through the stately plantation houses of Georgia. The state had just joined crosscheck. Whipped up by reports of voter fraud in inner city Atlanta, republican leaders had gathered at a golf course to take action. Do you think if the democrats are voting fraudulently, are they trying to steal the election? The fact that that could be happening is an enormous threat to our country and to our constitution and we must uncover it. So I went to hunt down these voting games in nearby Atlanta. Here I am undercover in Martin Luther King's old church. Turns out, their old age home was harboring the biggest nest of double voters in the nation. Is everyone excited to vote? Yes, yes, very. So you remember before the Voting Rights Act? All of us do. Do you remember when African Americans were blocked from voting? Oh yeah. From a lot of things, I remember. Couldn't even go to the movie theater unless you went on top. Couldn't use the toilet. Popcorn on it. They had colored popcorn. So is it different now? - Popcorn for coloreds. - Oh yeah. We've come a long way. Not long enough. Right, not long enough. So, does anyone still getting, feel like there's any troubles still going on? Yes. Do you think that the state's happy to see you voting today? No, not really. Not the republicans. They try to squash the vote as it is. It is what it is. It is what it is. Now you have to have identification to vote. You know that? Before you didn't have to that. Everyone have their ID with them? Yes. Is that the law? - You have to have that? - Yes, yes, I got mine. In Georgia. In Georgia? In other states you don't. This is what the ID looks like. Oh, can I see that? It took me months to get it. Took you months to get the voter ID? Yes, and it's not even, it's flimsy. Mr. James Jackson. The state of Georgia is matching names with people who voted in other states to see if you've already voted. James Jackson is on the crosscheck list. You didn't illegally vote twice, did you? No. So, who first accused these folks of voting twice? The answer would take me to Carolina to meet the man responsible for bringing crosscheck way down south to Dixie, Colonel Jay Delancey. And you would think that Jim Crow rose from the dead. Delancey was the lobbyist who got Carolina to join the crosscheck purge from his foxhole. What really concerns us is the people who are impersonating another voter. And this what they're really looking at with this investigation with the dual state voters. This is Interstate Crosscheck. Now these are the states we're involved in. Colonel Delancey is commander in chief of the Voter Integrity Project. These valiant vigilantes hunt down fraudulent voters. Problem is they haven't captured a single double voter despite their sophisticated methods. Fraud's hard to find. Hard to find? Really. 35,000 suspects in this state. He oughta be able to find them blindfolded. So I went to the office of the North Carolina Elections Board, to the republican PR flack who refused to give me the crosscheck lists, the guy who said they are confidential. I didn't tell him I had them. I just wanted to know why were we denied the list? You weren't the only group to ask for it, of course. We were threatened with many lawsuits. Do you consider voting fraud a serious crime? Certainly, it's certainly a problem if people do that. Your G-man, Stuber, is going after voter fraud. So, how's the fishing? Have you caught any fraudulent voters? So, we participated in the Kansas crosscheck and that yielded a number of individuals that we wanted to look into further. It's part of an ongoing investigation and we've been partnering with other crosscheck participating states to get the information that we would need that if there was any type of inappropriate behavior we would be able to send the right evidence on to the DAs and the DAs could decide whether to prosecute or not. Is it really difficult to find these people? You have their addresses and you don't have anybody. But you have this whole like hysteria over the fraudulent voters. But they don't seem to exist. The state couldn't find these double voters so I decided to hunt down these criminals myself. Our team found one guy, he voted many times, all over the place, under the name Park. Could I speak to Mr. Park? Look at this guy, Park, Park, Park. Yeah, I've heard that alibi before. I showed him the crosscheck list with the evidence he voted in Georgia and Virginia. Everything different. How to is a names is a same name is another, same names. But now I know we've got one. Voted in 14 states, once as a guy named Willie, then as a lady named Willie Mae, he's even got his own bus to vote in several states at once. That's him, that's him. William Nelson? You got me. William Nelson? Willie Nelson? Yes, sir. It says here, Willie Mae Nelson. Willie Mae what? Willie Mae Nelson voted in Georgia and then you voted again as Willie J. Nelson, okay, in Mississippi, all right? So the first time you voted as a woman. Is that what the pigtail thing? Okay, how'd you get away with it with the beard? So you have a bus. This is a good getaway vehicle. You think you're getting away with it. You think it's cute that you're voting again and again and again. This is a felony crime. In fact, it looks like, were you arrested before? That was just a little play thing we did, you know, just me and the cops. Wait, what are you grinning for? Are you high, are you smoking something? Aren't you? Maybe this old guy is telling the truth. It sound like you got better shit than I got. How good is the shit on this list? Here's the big secret list of millions who are accused of voting twice. Look at this. Maria Isabel Hernandez is supposed to be the same as Maria Cristina Hernandez. James Elmer Barnes, Jr. Of Georgia is supposed to have voted a second time in Virginia as James Cross Barnes the Third. We ran it through the computer. Two million of these middle names don't match. How about this? Billy Ray Jackson is accused of voting again as Billy Manuel Jackson, Jr. Junior and senior are supposed to be the same guy. Wow, the entire Jackson 5 is here. In fact, it's the Jackson 5,000. What the heck's going on here? The crosscheck PowerPoint sales pitch says they use social security numbers. They use birth dates but there are no social security numbers. There are no birth dates. Birthday different. Is the social security number different? Everything different. Forget about it Mr. Park. You still lose your vote. Each suspect on Kobach's list is supposed to get this postcard. It looks like junk mail, you'd throw it away. So you don't lose your vote because you voted twice. Your crime is that you got a common name and you didn't return a card. Why wipe out a voter's rights just because their name is Brown or Hernandez and didn't mail a postcard? A million voters disappeared because of a postcard. Kansas, why Kansas? Okay, Sherlock, tell me about this list. It's not a list of double voters is it, Palast? It's a giant list of common names. Yeah, real common, Jackson, Wong, Hernandez. Seems like someone really hates people with common names. So you're trying to tell us that they hate them enough to spend millions to write them off the voter rolls? Really, man? So where do I go now? It says Kansas, Dorothy, Kansas. So hit the yellow brick road, Toto. That's just great. I guess I'm off to Kansas. Here's our file on the wizard of crosscheck. The wizard is this guy, Kris Kobach. Wow, Harvard, Yale, Oxford, republican whiz kid, created the computer databases for Homeland Security which tracks Arabs traveling around the U.S., successful business man, with a family friendly assault rifle company, And the Voldemort of the entire Interstate Crosscheck data system. And odd for an elected official, he's also a lawyer for FAIR, the Federation for American Immigration Reform whose founder's goal is to preserve a European American majority. As Secretary of State, he's the top election official in Kansas. Republican superstar. Kobach and FAIR convinced the little town of Farmers Branch, Texas to pass a law arresting anyone doing business with illegal immigrants, like selling one a Slurpee. Courts found the law racist and unconstitutional. It's interesting that someone gave the town $100,000 to pay Kobach's fees. He's already become a Fox News national hero for saving America from an invasion of alien voters. Those dangerous aliens. Dreamer aliens. Alien votes. Republicans claim millions of alien voted in our elections. 12 million illegal aliens in the USA who could vote without proper identification. They're bringing drugs. Hundreds of illegals not supposed to be in the country but registered to vote. They're bringing crime. No, no. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. Those are the reasons I decided that I'm endorsing Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States. Republicans claim literally millions of alien voters are pouring over the border. Arizona built this prison for alien voters but there aren't any. To grab and jail them, Kobach wrote a law for Arizona, SB1070, known as the Driving While Brown Law. Other Kobach laws were credited with stopping terrorists intent on voting. I tracked down one suspect stopped from voting. She uses the name Shirley. Shirley, Shirley, are you a terrorist? Are you a terrorist? A parrot? A terrorist? A terrorist. A parrot? Taro, terrorist. Terrorist, somebody who'd blow up buildings and stuff? Will you blow up buildings, mom? Here in a desert hideout, I found a whole gang that the law blocked from voting. Father. Kobach's laws blocked 200,000 voters in Arizona alone, over 60% are Hispanics and Native Americans. Kobach has ruled that voters must prove that they are Americans to vote. But he was blocked by a lawsuit filed by a group of ladies he exposed as a communist front as he calls them the Communist League of Women Voters. So I hit Wichita. I arrived just in time to catch white republicans in their natural habitat. It's feeding time, what anthropologists call an ice cream social. I was in the mood for chocolate but all they serve is vanilla. Kobach's citizenship test for voting knocked out 36,000 young new voters, under 30s. Now I see why. Kobach's voters have an average age of 115. There he is, the wizard of crosscheck. Kobach refused to meet with me. Cameras on? Let's go. But I'm about to meet with him. We're number one and we may not always be number one in NCAA basketball but we're number one when it comes to guns and protecting elections and I'll take that any day. I'm gonna go, yep, yep, exactly. I'm gonna go around the other side. Mr. Kobach? Hi, hey I want to congratulate you. You are the number one fraudulent voter hunter in the United States. Thank you very much. You're the guy behind the crosscheck list. The title on this list is duplicate voters, okay? So, wait, I noticed most of the names, wait sir, that most of these are, oh. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic This reminds me, for which it stands, Kobach took on the president one nation under God. Over double voters. Take double voting, that's a slam dunk to prove that. A guy has voted in Kansas and he's voted in Colorado. It's a state crime, it's also a federal crime but the Obama Administration is not interested in prosecuting, surprise, surprise. - I wanted to know - One nation under God, why crosscheck is so secretive indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Why wouldn't you give out the list? Why are these such secret lists if they are. Not a secret list? His office said it was a secret, not subject to disclosure. We had to lift it from a side channel. My bullshit alarm was ringing. What is the point of sending a card to James Evans Johnson to prove that he is not James P. Johnson? What's the point of sending him a card? That should not be an individual who's deemed a match. Excuse me, but you say ignore the matches. You tell people to go, you tell the states, this is you, right? Kansas Secretary of State? Says Kansas Secretary of State, this is you. Let's get back to your... How can you have these as the same voter, potentially the same voter? Our system would not yield them as the same voter. This is from your system. But his system did target Johnson, all these are his matches. This is the list you gave Virginia and on the basis of this list, you know that Virginia removed 41,000 voters based on the list you gave them? That is false. But Virginia did cancel the registrations of these voters. Why lie? You said that there is a massive problem with double voters. You've given out this list. These are not double voters. This is the list, you say it's potential double voters. No, no, no, no. All of his own propaganda says potential duplicate voters, double voters, double votes. It's his own words. These documents crosscheck with his wardrobe. You are a fool. Wait. No I'm wasting my time. Why all the bullshit and secrecy about crosscheck? Look at these names, - they don't match. - You're lying. You're lying. This is random list of... Kobach knows crosscheck's just a con. Based on the Virginia data, they're gonna knock out a million voters and steal the election. It is my turn, go away. Go away! If crosscheck's legit, why hide the list? Why the lies? We're out of here, Toto. But where the hell do I go now? Kobach's behind the crosscheck con. But who's behind Kobach? Just give me a sign, Lord. I just need a clue. Who's got the millions and millions to promote this voter vanishing game? It says Kansas, detective, Kansas. Genius, nobody takes a crap in Kansas without the approval of the brothers. The Kochs, again. I've been on the trail to Koch for two decades. Koch industry's operatives would bury oil next to drinking water sites, would pollute rivers, would dump oil in... Man, I had too much hair. Twenty years ago, David and Charles Koch were the richest guys you've never heard of. They got their money the old fashioned way, they stole it from the Indians, like this. The Osage Indians, poorer than dirt, let the Koch truck away oil from their Oklahoma reservation. Koch would pay for 90 barrels of oil but Charles told their truckers to take 100. One of Koch's buddies told us. Then we asked Charles why the billionaire would skim three dollars a week from some poor Indian family. Koch said, I want my fair share and that's all of it. Three bucks a week per Indian added up to over one billion dollars for the Kochs. The FBI and federal prosecutors wrote up a criminal indictment that could put Charles behind bars for theft and racketeering. But the Kochs got their buddy, Kansas Senator Bob Dole, to get the prosecutor replaced with a crony and the criminal indictment went poof. The Kochs then gave the senator $100,000 which federal authorities made him give back. In 1995, Koch Oil was charged with 312 criminal counts of dumping three million gallons of oil sludge into rivers in six states. Rather than comply with the law, they decide to buy control of the entire U.S. Congress to change the law. How? The answer came from an insider who called me to rat on Charles and David, their little brother, Billy. Little Koch told me that his brothers... They, my brother, unfortunately, views himself as above the law, views himself... Which brother? You have three. Charles. Back to his libertarian philosophy where he believes that laws are immoral. He views himself as being above it and will go out and do whatever he wants, steal oil, pollute the environment, et cetera, and then when he gets caught, what he then does or someone's coming after him once, then he goes and buys all the politicians he can to counter that influence, to try to mitigate the costs of the crimes. And they've been very effective at it, very effective. I know they've given a couple dollars to Dole. Right. And, let's say they've given dollars to Triad. Triad? Holy mama! Triad was the secret conduit of those millions to a front called Coalition for our Children's Future, the children ran ads linking democrats to child molesters, wife beaters, and they accused one democrat of being Jewish, oy vey. The smear worked and the Koch republicans took control of the 105th Congress. If Koch Industries had secretly funded Triad then the brothers had committed a go to jail crime at the time it was illegal for corporations to grease political campaigns. Doesn't matter. In the case of Citizens United, the Supreme Court decriminalized campaign contribution by corporations like ISIS Inc. And Manson and Company. Billy Koch also told me that his brothers had put up over 75 million bucks to set up a series of think tanks and front groups including Citizens for a Sound Economy which the Kochs morphed into FreedomWorks which drafted the demands of a group of cross dressers called the Tea Party. The Kochs also fund The Heritage Foundation which promotes the mass purge of voter rolls. And The Heritage Foundation's latest crusade? Kansas Interstate Crosscheck. I get Badpenny on the case. Connect Mr. Crosscheck Kobach. Okay, pay attention. And the Brothers Koch. Koch Brothers, they've hired Whitney Ball to run their money funneling outfits, Donors Capital Fund, State Policy Network, Heritage Foundation, Federation of American Immigration Reform, Delancey, the Voting Integrity Project, so has Josh Lawson, Jay Delancey, a $100,000, the bill called SB1070 which is a, duplicate voting, deporting, anti-immigration, this trust, over a million to Numbers USA, $100,000, Farmers Branch, Texas, Kris Kobach. Got that? So the Kochs shoved a pile of cash to Donors Trust which gave a cool million to Numbers USA which dropped 100 grand on Farmers Branch and that's the money that went to Kobach. So Kobach's just another spider in the Koch web taking their cash and now he's bleaching the voter rolls for the Kochs. But why? Why do guys who have 100 billion dollars need to buy the White House? I had no idea until Badpenny received a message from the Chief of Criminal Intelligence of the article republic. The chief demand that I travel immediately to Kaktovik. I hit Google Earth. Kaktovik's an island just above the arctic circle. I tell her there's no way I'm running up to the arctic to chat with some crazy Eskimo. We are not a conquered people. We're not defeated. What gives you the right to trespass? You mother fuckers! Got that, white trash? Now, okay. This is Etok. Welcome to Kaktovik. The legendary whale hunter, former professor at the University of California at Berkeley, and leader of the Inuits Speakers of Alaska's Arctic, and one badass Eskimo. This the healthiest stock in the fucking world. This? This is the healthiest whaling stock in the world. So this is not commercial, this is cultural. This is culture, this is a culture? Just chopping up whales? Yeah. Okay, so let me ask a question. Seriously, you've been claiming this, Etok, as native land. Yeah. Why should this be your land? It was our land since time immemorial. We're the last of the Pleistocene people. We are the same people for 28,000 fucking years. And yet, you want to come here and destroy it? In case you can't translate his Inuit phrases... I don't give a fuck what the governor... Koch Industries and British Petroleum need the oil under this very whale. This is destruction in progress. And you are the witness to that destruction. What are you doing about it? As a reporter for British TV, he wants me to send a message to my queen. He tells me if we start drilling, that is the end of us. It's cheaper to cheat than it is to practice the law. There's no supermarket here. All this was gathered at the end of a harpoon. Best thing that'll keep you going all day. I made five gallon. Take the muktuk like this. I'm going for it. I'm happening. Um, ladies and gentlemen... It tastes better than it looks. Okay. He brought me here to swallow muktuk, whale meat in fermented blood, mmm. I've seen this before. What happens when the poor and powerless get in the way of an oil drill. I saw it in the Amazon. The mass poisoning. I saw it in the Caspian Sea, Cancer Alley. And right here in Alaska when I investigated the smash-up of the Exxon Valdez. Here's some of Exxon's sludge I picked up after the spill, 20 years after the spill. There's no such thing as a victimless billionaire and there's no way to control an oil spill among these icebergs. The scent of oil and money led me here, to Prudhoe Bay, the starting point of this rusty old piece of pipe, the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The Kochs have bought into this pipeline but the pipeline is about to shutdown for lack of oil. So why in the world would the smartest white businessmen in America buy into an oil pipeline with no oil in it? Answer, they could fill it up with arctic oil. But this would require the Kochs to get a president of the United States nuts enough to drill under Etok's whale. Hell, the Kochs can do that. They've dumped 750 millions dollars into the 2016 election. For three quarters of a billion bucks, they expect a second pipe thrown into the deal. I want the Keystone Pipeline. You should love the Keystone Pipeline. Love the Keystone Pipeline? The Keystone XL Pipeline will bring the world's filthiest oil, tar sands from Canada, all the way across the belly of the United States, over our water resources, down to Texas. Oil to Texas? Why in the world would you have to ship oil to Texas? The answer is here in Corpus Christi, home of the Koch Brother's giant refinery. But the Kochs have a problem. They can't use Texas oil, it's not filthy enough, it's not dirty enough for their refinery. They have to use superheavy crude, gunk like you get from the tar sands. So for years, the Kochs had to import their extra filthy crude from Caracas and the price of that heavy oil was set by this man, the Frank Sinatra of Venezuela. Years ago, President Hugo Chavez told me... Venezuela, with the world's biggest reserve of oil, would really stick it to U.S. customers like the Kochs. Do the math. Canada charges $15 a barrel less than Venezuela. If the Kochs can get their Canadian sludge down to their Texas refinery, they will earn a billion dollars each. So who is the political plumber who'll put in the fix for the Kochs pipe? Look, look, the oil is coming from up here. It connects, two pipelines connect here in Alberta. What we're missing is the opportunity to bring it to the even larger petrochemical refineries that are in Texas and Louisiana... Karl Rove, Chief of Staff to the president of the United States. He was known as Bush's brain. But Bush called him Turd Blossom. Absolutely, and one other geopolitical point, this would reduce our reliance upon the heavy crude similar that comes out of Canada that comes out of Venezuela, it would allow us to further crater our opponents in Venezuela. Turd Blossom has been in the computer targeting game since his twenties as a voter database nerd working for the creep. Well, I'm not a crook. And here's how Rove uses his computers. I know, I've been investigating Rove since 2004 when that little birdie, love that little guy, dropped off some highly, highly confidential emails from Karl Rove's research chief to George W. Bush's campaign chiefs titled caging. The lists were names of voters living at homeless shelters and minority soldiers at the naval air station in Florida. The homeless weren't home and Badpenny discovered the sailors were overseas. So I took the thousands of names to a law school dean who explained caging to me. Caging is a system by which you can target cohorts of voters and get them excluded from the lists and it's illegal in this country and it's illegal particularly if you, it's illegal under a number of statutes but if you target black or minority voters it's illegal under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Specifically, it's a felony and it's punished by high fines but also imprisonment. The Republican Party has done this in the past. They will get the addresses of the black voters in a particular state then they will mail certified letters to each of those homes and if the voter's not there at the time that the letter is delivered to accept delivery, the post office will automatically send that letter back to the sender which in this case is the Republican National Committee. If the letter comes back, the Republican National Committee uses that letter as presumptive evidence that the voter gave a false address on this voting form and is therefore ineligible to vote. Go to Iraq, lose your vote, mission accomplished. Caging, it's effective, it's illegal, it's Rove. Now, Rove and his computers have grown up. The simple caging computers have morphed into Data Trust, hourly tracking over 1,800 things about you, Mr. Voter, including the last time you downloaded porn, to whether you ordered Chinese food just before you voted. I think that's creepy. Mark Swedlund is an expert for companies that live and die by their databases. I360 Data Trust have literally thousands of data points on you, Greg Palast and on me and on everybody who's watching this film. What's this 1360? Their databases would include trillions of data points on hundreds of millions of people. Rove is partnered with his big voter surveillance system called i360. Who gets all that creepy data? Turns out i360 was founded by two brothers. I want my fair share and that's all of of it. With all that computer power, couldn't the Kochs and Rove find real double voters? You could do that in a heartbeat. Could you find double voters using a sophisticated database like i360 if they existed? I would argue it would be a piece of cake. So why not? Is crosscheck more sophisticated? Swedlund told me that crosscheck is... Incredibly simplistic. Such a sloppy technique, a very dangerous thing. It's what they did in the case of crosscheck is to come up with the most simplistic mushing together of data, first name, last name, a childish methodology. So why do republicans use crosscheck to name seven million unlikely suspects when they can find double voters accurately and cheaply with i360? There's lots of things that they could do, wonder whether this is an effort to find how many people you can take off the voter rolls as opposed to really finding those rare cases of people who voted across state lines. Today, Rove has been given half a billion dollars through his cover operation American Crossroads for winning back... The White House, taking the Senate, and keeping the House in republican hands. Officially, Rove's operation is a social services charity, like Save the Whales. So he can keep his donors names in the dark. And look who we found in the darkness, Rove's top donor, I just knew it, Paul Singer, The Vulture. I've been following this billionaire bird for a decade from the Andes... Uh, do you mind an interview for BBC Television? To Africa. The Vulture got his name by the way he made his billions feasting on the corpses of dying nations. He figured out a way to grab the aid money meant for nations suffering civil war, mass starvation, and epidemics. Like any vulture, Singer feasts when his victims die. The Vulture has been accused by Oxfam of grabbing money meant for cholera clinics in the Congos like this one. What's your favorite subject? Mathematics in French. Mathematics in French. Oxfam is stunned that vulture financiers have seized over 100 million dollars needed to clean the Congo's water supply. 100 million dollars for the Congo. How many villages could be provided clean water? Five million of people can have good access to water and sanitation and 200,000 children will have their life saved. So 100 millions dollars, 200,000 children... Saved. Would that make you happy? Very, very happy. Well, forget happy. The Vulture paid just 10 million bucks for some old Congo Republic bonds which he used to bleed 127 million dollars from the suffering nation. Vultures are known to vomit on their enemies. So I wasn't surprised when Singer's henchman called my TV network to stop my investigation saying we have a file on Greg Palast. Today, Singer The Vulture is the new number one donor to the republican party. The Vulture's money also hatched House Speaker Paul Ryan, the most powerful post in Washington after the president. So why does The Vulture have to spend all this money to buy the U.S. Congress? The Vulture made his biggest killing ever by preying on this third world nation, Detroit. And chewing on this, the corpse of the auto industry when it collapsed in 2009. Ten years earlier, to save money, General Motors had spun off its famous car parts company, Delco, and turned Delco into a separate company called Delphi. As part of a plan to bail out the auto industry, the government agreed to help GM buy back Delphi and save Delco's 25,000 happy, dancing, union workers. But GM and the government didn't know was that The Vulture and his partner had secretly scooped up ownership of Delphi. And the vulture pack told GM and the president of the United States that unless Obama gave the vultures 12.9 billion dollars and now they would close down Delphi and cut off GM's parts. Ouch. Without those parts, the entire auto industry would shut down forever and over a million jobs would vanish. U.S. car czar called the vultures demand extortion. But the U.S. Treasury paid the 12 billion. The vultures had bough Delphi for just 67 cents a share. With the bailout loop, the shares zoomed to $22. Singer's slice, $1,284,514,000. Singer fired every single one of the union workers and Delphi moved 100,000 jobs overseas, mostly to China. Then our little birdie dropped another paper into my hand showing that before the 2012 election, Singer's vulture fund setup a special partnership with a blind trust of the wife of a presidential candidate. ♪ For purple mountains majesty ♪ ♪ Above the fruited plain ♪ The Vulture paid the Romneys up to 115 million bucks. ♪ God shed his grace on thee ♪ Out of the auto bailout loot. This was a whole new way to influence a president, stuff 100 million into his bank account. ♪ From sea to shining sea ♪ I thought I'd ask the billionaire himself about his special way of enriching politicians. Time for a vulture hunt to meet the man funding the vote munching machine. Please help me welcome Paul Singer. You and... Badpenny laid out the elaborate plan to cover his escape routes. Yes, so like, pay attention. So this is the rotunda where they walk through to go to the little steps they come down the step. Zach can hang out here in case he went 61st and hung around there and then just walks down the steps. And we practiced signals with three undercover cameramen. Because America is clamoring for reassurance that our system isn't rigged in favor of the rich and powerful. Borrowing the name tag Craig Kettleman, I tried to get close to ask the GOP's top sugar daddy about the missing votes and the missing Delphi jobs in Ohio and why he needs to buy a new president. Can you get a question to Mr. Singer? But my disguise failed and The Vulture's hospitality chiefs clocked me from jump. Does Singer keep a file on me? Oh, you're talking into your sleeve? Would you do that again? That's very James Bond. Can I talk into your sleeve? Don't touch me. Okay, all right. Can I talk into your sleeve? You can go home. Mr. Singer, I just want to ask you how many billions is it worth to buy the White House and your candidate? There is no such thing as a victimless billionaire. I met some of the victims in Detroit. The city's streets had already been bank-bombed. Houses foreclosed and emptied, their windows smashed out, weeds belly high. It looked like the city had been punched in the face, it's teeth knocked out. This house hear is vacant. This house is vacant. Then you look across the street over there, those houses are vacant over there. This is Mr. and Mrs. Pratt. They're gonna lose their home, too. Robert Pratt's an auto worker. But his wife lost her job at the City of Detroit and they couldn't make the payments on some predatory mortgage. This is my son, this is my son here. This is Robert. That's the one who got shot in the backyard. That's my 12 year old, that was my boy. Like I told my wife, I go to work every day, I'm a maintenance man, I have a shop. I go in the maintenance shop and I close the door and that's when I cry, that's when I cry, you know, because when I'm around people I try to stay strong and keep my eyes open and everything but the pain runs so deep when you have to wake up every day wondering is they gonna try to take my house away. I mean, what's next? Here's what's next. We snuck into Republican Party headquarters to investigate evident the GOP was challenging the right of voters like Pratt who are facing foreclosure on grounds their homes are no longer valid addresses. Lose your home, lose your vote. Now I have to wake up and I'm like, man, they trying to take my right to vote away? I mean, come one, how much, how low can you go? Real low, Mr. Pratt. You and two million other families who are about to lose their homes and someone couldn't be happier. It's going really well for John Paulson. Paulson made a personal profit of more than five billion dollars last year and that is probably the biggest one year personal gain in investment history. John Paulson, known as JP, the foreclosure king. One guy gets five billion bucks in one year. He must have gotten it from Santa Claus. Eh, pay attention, Palast! In 2008 when the mortgage market was heading over a cliff, JP gave it an extra kick in the ass. 'Cause every time a mortgage in America went kablooey, JP made another buck. All together he made five billion bucks. More money than any human since the pharaohs. Here's how he did it. In 2007, JP cut a deal with the bankers at Goldman Sachs. Goldman had lined up some schmucks in big European banks and pension funds. Goldman told the schmucks that they and JP together would buy billions of dollars of something called CDOs which stands for synthetic collateralized debt obligation derivatives. If you don't know what a synthetic collateralized debt obligation derivatives CDO is, you're not a billionaire. Think of these derivatives as a kind of insurance on home mortgages. If the mortgage goes bad and someone loses their home to foreclosure, the insurers must pay. What Goldman didn't tell the schmucks providing insurance is that JP was secretly betting against these very mortgages. JP was the secret beneficiary of the insurance policies. JP was the one who would collect the insurance if the mortgages went to hell. It's kind of like an arsonist buying fire insurance on buildings he's sure will burn down. JP even helped pick out the mortgages that they schmucks would insure. He deliberately chose the shittiest subprime mortgages with horrible interest rates, like the ones sinking the Pratt Family. These stinking bags of mortgages were packaged into securities, those collateralized debt obligations. Within a year, the stinking bags of mortgage securities went down the toilet losing 99% of their value. As homeowners went bankrupt, their schmucks paid out billions collected by JP. The mortgage market imploded and foreclosures exploded. And JP, lots of folks assumed he'd go to prison. Nah. The politically connected JP kept the whole five billion dollars. He's not in jail, he's living large. Welcome to the lifestyles of the rich and shameless. Welcome to the Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless. Billionaire John Paulson. JP is lord of this manor with 70 rooms, 2,000% bigger than that pathetic little hovel that the Pratts are losing. And just one of JP's homes is the largest in Manhattan. JP is hosting a billionaires brunch for Donald Trump. They'll let you in. But only if you pony up a quarter million dollars. I don't have a quarter million. But look, a back entrance to the secret location of the billionaires chow-down right here on Wall Street. No, I wasn't invited. And this is Old Trees, JP's gorgeous mansion, ritziest in the Hamptons. So how do I get to Trump's billionaire backer? Okay, wait, I'm not going back to your statement, it was a question, I want an answer, not a statement. I'm serious about this, I can't, you know, you keep saying I'm wrong. I have said that the SCC's statements and have never been contradicted is that Paulson sat in those rooms and didn't tell those poor schmucks that they were buying crap and that he had picked out to go down the toilet. Why were they schmucks? Wait, JP's flunky just called to say Mr. Paulson was unhappy with my report on his flimflam. Okay, just a yes or no. I want Mr. Paulson's answers. But five billion off foreclosures wasn't enough for JP. He also flocked up with The Vulture to feast on the corpse of Delphi. JP's pound of flesh from Delphi, more than two billions dollars. That's one fact they wanted me to get right. He's continuing to fund republicans. And JP's taken his Wall Street buddies uptown. He's become the chief of a group of economic advisors to Mr. Trump. JP was hiding from me. But then we heard that JP and a bunch of billionaires had paid some big named tennis pros to pretend to play tennis with them. The billionaires all won trophies. They always do. Our plan was to hunt him down in the Hamptons and Badpenny made sure that this time we wouldn't miss. GoPros, wireless microphones. Don't talk to it, you will be fine. What if you run into him in the bathroom? Just leave it be. It doesn't matter, you need to know how to use it, okay? So pay attention. This has a camera, okay? Just put it on. Don't touch it. Just take it off carefully. If all else fails, we've got this little guy. Badpenny planned an invasion by sea. We thought we'd join in his ritzy celebration so we hit his thousand dollar a plate vanity fundraiser Celebrating his tennis victories. A full 20 cents of each dollar would go to charity. There's four goons behind us, behind me and they are making me uncomfortable. 'Cause one of them actually looks smart. We were stationed near the servants and hunted our vulture among the billionaire birds sucking their champagne cocktails. And there he was. JP, the foreclosure profiteer of the century. Badpenny played by ditzy wife. Can I have his picture taken with my husband? Glad to meet you, thanks a lot. I'm Greg Palast. Listen, I was just wondering when you kind of helped push the mortgage market over the cliff, did you ever think about maybe letting some of those people that lost their homes to foreclosure stay in your place in Aspen, you know you got 70 rooms, you don't need them. I didn't have anything to do with the mortgage market. You have nothing... We never made one mortgage in our lives. Nothing to do with the mortgage market? He just gave a lecture at Yale boasting about his billions on his subprime mortgage market kill. All right, so what about Delphi? You know how many Delphi... Delphi, how many, do you ever think about the American workers? There were tens of thousands, tens of thousands who lost their jobs that you sent off to China. You made a billion bucks. JP, come on. You can give me an answer. What's the question? Okay, I want to know. He made over a billion bucks on Delphi, right? And what happened to the workers? Delphi was... 30,000 workers, 30,000 workers were shifted to China. Does that make you happy? That's how you want to make your money? You know they have 21,000 engineers in Detroit? Huh? Delphi told the SCC they left only 5,000 jobs in America and moved 122,000 abroad. Were the documents lying? Or Paulson? I found the Delphi workers. They were having dinner, too. When we got the notice, it was like a two week notice. They just said well, we're closing the doors. We just don't know the longer, they were sending somewhere else. Giving out gloves, gloves and hats, looks like these. They do it every year. It looks like this, hats and gloves. That's pretty neat. They're donated through different people. So you know like, everybody's figured you know when they gonna lose their job, everybody said well, heck, we got kids. A lot of people had kids at the time. I got a couple of buddies of mine almost committed suicide over the job. A lot of people say they was losing their home and their mortgages on their houses. They just put it, the bank called foreclosures. Dale Stamper joined some old friends from Delphi. It wasn't a thousand a plate, no charge for the hungry. This is Delphi, where the carcass of Delphi, left after JP and his vulture buddy Singer got through with it. I don't see a tennis court. And I don't see those 21,000 workers that Paulson claimed he saved. How does this happen? I know they can't take your job and home and hope unless they take away your power to do something about it. If they're gonna take away your job and take away your home, they'd better take away your vote. And I discovered how they did it in 2012 when I visited a nearby church that ministers to the laid-off Delphi workers. It was election day, or for black folk, Souls to the Poles day. - Hi. - Hello. What's the name of this church? Freedom Faith. Tell me. Freedom Faith Missionary Baptist Church. Is today Souls to the Poles Day? Yes. I have a question. Is today the day that people are gonna be voting, vote after church? I have no idea. Shepherding the souls is Tara Williams. We're actually, our congregation is gonna take individuals, our congregation, down to the voting election right immediately after service. Are you gonna vote today? Are you joining us for church also? I would love to. Well, come on in. Come on in, get fed. ♪ Come and go with me ♪ ♪ To my Father's house ♪ ♪ There is peace, peace, peace ♪ ♪ I got another old bad ♪ And then they piled into the church van to vote. Bye, bye-bye. ♪ This little light of mine ♪ ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ They arrived and got in line and waited and waited and waited. You're here with the Souls to the Poles. And there's your soles. The overwhelming majority of black people in Ohio vote on the Sunday before election day 'cause they can't take Tuesday off. Early voting is required by U.S. law but Ohio's republican Secretary of State has resisted it. He shut down almost every big city early polling station in Dayton. He permitted only one single voting place for over 80,000 black voters. Excuse me, can I ask you why are you waiting in this line? Well, I have to exercise my right to vote. So, if I have to stand in line to do it, then I'm gonna do that. It's really cold. So they waited for hours. ♪ I'm gonna let it shine ♪ ♪ Let it shine, let it shine, let it ♪ Outside the city, in the suburbs, I checked the wait on the lines where white people vote. Well, actually there's no line. ♪ Let it shine ♪ Back in Dayton, they waited and waited, nearly half a million black folk, all over Ohio. Then something quite odd happened. At the end of the line, after hours, the souls at the poles did not get ballots. If you're just arriving, come on in. Have a seat, look for Frank. He's wearing the tie, he'll get you seated. They got a number to wait for this instead. These are applications for absentee ballots. But they're not absent, they're right here at the legal poll. Then they got mail-in ballots and envelopes to put them in. Using an absentee ballot is playing bingo with your vote. Number 175, number 175 can head up the steps, stay to the left as you exit, 175 and under. The nasty secret of American democracy is that over one million absentee ballots are rejected, never counted. Is this ballot switcheroo even legal? I drove through the night with one of these pseudo ballots to Ohio's capital and at midnight, I reached the home of law professor Robert Fitrakis. He was crazy enough to let me in. I showed him what they were giving black voters. Every early voter, almost all of them African Americans, were handed an absentee ballot. Is that common practice here? Uh, absolutely uncommon. And I would suspect it's either done out of incompetence, for convenience, or to defraud people of their vote. You vote absentee, they can pick through the absentee and say they didn't fill this out all the way, they didn't sign here, they didn't initial there and thus, toss the absentee. Essentially, they're treating the absentee like a second class provisional ballot. None of that could be done in regular early voting. But the state did it anyway. I didn't have the heart to tell them that their ballots may never get counted. In fact, over two million ballots, not just absentees are cast and not counted. That's official. They call it spoilage. How do votes spoil? By leaving them out of the fridge. There are 10 ways to spoil your vote or wipe away your registration. Think your registered? This election, over three million of you will find your registration go poof. They toss out your mail-in ballot because you've used the wrong envelope, for postage due, forgot to add your middle initial, fly poop on the ballot, or you didn't fill in the bubble. We've been invited into the home of voters whose votes didn't count. Did not fill in the bubble. So why didn't you fill in the bubble? I didn't know, when you fill in the name that you had to put a bubble. Mom, it said you had to put in the fill in the bubble. I'm sorry. Your sister and I did not draw circles. She's an ex-schoolteacher, she don't know how to fill in a bubble. I'm an ex-schoolteacher and she's a lawyer. We did not do it. There's purging, caging, or you have the wrong ID. In Texas, hands up. Gun ID okay, school ID not okay. In some states, up to 45% of new registrations are simply tossed in the spoilage bin. Don't worry, they'll tell you, if your name's missing from the voter roll, you get something called a provisional ballot. But because your name's not on the rolls, they throw it out. But you get to pretend you voted. Then there's good old ballot stuffing. Whose votes get thrown in the spoilage dumpster? According to the U.S. Civil Rights Commission, the chance of your vote spoiling is 900% higher if you're than if you're white. For voters of color in the USA, voting has become some kind of crazy obstacle course. Oh! You all right, Steve? First, don't get purged, don't get caged, then drag yourself to the single black voting station and wait for five hours. Oops, wrong ID, go back home. Fill out absentee or provisional ballot, don't miss the bubble or it gets thrown in the garbage. Come on. We can do it. You got it, you got it. So how do they get away with it? Creating these obstacles to voting? Easy, the Kochs and their minions like The Heritage Foundation they yell voter fraud and the media eats it up. Voter registration fraud... Voter fraud... - Voter fraud... - Fraud. Voter fraud. Voter fraud. Vote fraud. Voter fraud. To sell the nonsense of mass voter fraud, they've built A hysteria factory. They claim there are millions of dead voters. Adolf Hitler. Yes, that name has now appeared on an Ohio voter registration card. Felon voters, ghost voters, alien voters. In 2010, there were approximately 50 Somalians stealing my vote. Listen to me! They're not human! Can't you see? Everyone, they're here already. Join me! And now, double voters. Probably over a million people that voted twice in this election. The double voting accusation is old stuff. Birth of a Nation a hundred years ago, the most influential film of its time, depicted white actors in blackface sneaking in a second ballot. It praised the Ku Klux Klan for saving the South from black rule. The film helped the Democratic Party block the passage of a federal law to stop lynching. By 1968, 3,446 black people were hung from trees and bridges. Today, they don't use hanging ropes to get rid of black voters. It's now lynching by laptop. And the night rider's white sheets have turned into spreadsheets. So I quit, I give up. I can't stop the electronic lynchings and I can't stop the vultures stealing lives. Because once again, not one American network, not one American newspaper would agree to run this story of crosscheck nor the story of billionaires crushing Delphi for it may expose the con called American democracy. My work is banished to Britain and abroad. No one in America will tell this story. So forget it. Greg. Greg, it's time for you to go home. Greg, it's time for you to go home. No, I'll never go back home. 8413 Went Avenue, where I grew up in the East Valley of Los Angeles. So this is a former GM plant, huh? My own Ohio. This was the GM plant that made Chevies and Frigidaire refrigerators. My father sold the refrigerators. So now, it's like shut down and they took it all to Mexico. The union guys at GM bought campers for their vacations. Now they live in the campers next to the tracks. So why'd you quit? Because this system is screwed, it's fixed and I hate it. This is why you can't stop. If you don't do it, no one else will. So look Greg, your phone is gonna ring. It's gonna be Badpenny and you have to answer it and you have to... Pay attention. You've got to get back right now and look at these Ohio numbers. Ohio, oh my God. 43,000 black voters have just vanished. Crosscheck, of course. 497,000 suspected double voters. So it's back to Ohio. ♪ So your brother's bound and gagged ♪ ♪ And they've chained him to a chair ♪ ♪ Won't you please come to Ohio just to sing ♪ ♪ In a land that's known as freedom ♪ Ohio, this is the ultimate swing state. Ohio voters will choose our president, if they're allowed to vote. Donald Eugene Webster, that's not my middle name. Eugene is not your middle name? No. You ever use the name Eugene? No. They say you do. Hmm-mmm, I'm not... You know it's a crime if you vote more than once? Of course. It never occurred to me to do that. Have you? You know, what's two votes gonna do when you got thousands and thousands and thousands. You gotta have a bunch of people doing that. Well, do you? Are you part of a large conspiracy? No, I'm not, sir. You're not? No, I just go to vote. I vote every election and every primary, every one. When a young man, he moved to Dayton. It was a different time. He signed on at GM Delphi. Although he was training as an engineer... I was working as a janitor at GM. They just would take your application and either throw it in the trash and marked great big red C on it. It was something crazy so that they would know that... What was the C for? Colored. I remember the Civil Rights Act. I remember all of those things, it's almost all gone. Somebody dropped the ball, maybe it was us and our age group, that we thought it was over and that we didn't have to fight no more. You know, so you're fighting the same battles over again. I'm 70 years old. Almost all the fighting in me is gone. I'm not gonna go out there and try to, you know, bust no heads up, but I'd like for the people who know what the problem is to name the names, names of these people who are doing this. And here's the name he's looking for, Jon Husted. The Kris Kobach of Ohio. The republican Secretary of State has conducted what may be the biggest purge of voters in the nation. Well over 100,000 voters are gone. While investigators did not know all the reasons for the purge, we found a big one. He knows what he's doing is illegal. What he's doing is counting on bigotry to get away with it. He's picking first and last names only because he doesn't want to actually match people by using the middle name. He wants to purge blacks and Hispanics and he's trying to make Ohio winnable and the only way he knows how, by stealing American citizens votes. And whether it's crosscheck, alien voter purges, fake felon lists, or absentee ballot games, it seems like almost all the vote suppression victims have one thing in common. But exactly how does Crosscheck target voters of color? We did a deep dive into the data and we found lots of interesting findings such as that the most common surnames hit at an incredibly high rate. God forbid that your last name is Garcia of which there are 858,000 in the United States and your first name is Jose or Joe or Joseph. Because you probably are suspected of voting in 27 states. If your name is Jackson, it's likely you're African American. 90% of all Washingtons are black. Garcias, 91% Hispanic. And Kim, 94% Asian. There is an ethnic bias we discovered in the states we looked at in detail in the crosscheck list. And basically, it says Asians, Hispanics, and African Americans are over represented. 20% of the minority voters in those states are on the crosscheck list. That, is to me, is flabbergasting. A cheap racist vote suppression trick? I thought so. But then I found Maria Hernandez. What it says here, is that Maria Isabel Hernandez of Georgia voted a second time as Maria Cristina Hernandez of Louisiana. Clearly. - Is this something... - Obviously. Do Hispanics vote consistently more than one time? Are there literally hundreds? According to these documents there are literally hundreds of thousands of Hispanics voting several times. Yeah, it's been this like big outrageous plan that we've all been working since childbirth to like make sure that we all similar names so that we could vote multiple times across states. You talking about Wongs, you're talking about Hernandezes, you're talking about Washingtons. It's a lot of Asian folks and it's a lot of black folks and it's a lot of people who all have common names like the reason why we do that is specifically so we can get around these voter laws and actually vote twice. That's like been the big major plan of how we were gonna take over this country. Wow, a full confession. You think Hispanics vote twice illegally? Look at this group. Vote Gangnam Style. Vote Gangnam Style. It's Asian Americans nationally are the fastest growing electorate and our political power is growing. My maiden name is Kim, Helen Kim. If you Googled Helen Kim, there's like a million Helen Kims. Indeed, a stunning one in eight Asian Americans are on the suspect list. Korean surnames, it's like Kim is like Smith, Park is like Johnson, like... Especially if you have a common name like mine, Jason Kim, is like... So you're Kim, too. So how many times did you vote? I've only voted once ever every time. Republicans fear Asian Americans are voting... Vote, vote, vote, Gangnam Style. Like they turned black. Democrats now capture three out of four Asian American votes. Why are they using these tricks to get rid of voters of color? Because it's a changing country. The demographics are changing. It's not a traditional America anymore. Whereby, 20 years ago President Obama would be roundly defeated. The white establishment is now the minority. So what can the GOP do? If you can't win the black vote, reduce it, block it. Rove says if black turnout drops just one point in North Carolina, democrats are wiped out. Crosscheck will purge 10% of the black voters in North Carolina and a million voters nationwide. In 2012, all the tricks and long lines failed to steal the election. But then, just eight months after the president's reelection there was an earthquake in Voting Rights law and it was devastating. The implications for the 2016 presidential race and for crosscheck would be enormous. On June 25th, 2013, the Supreme Court took Martin Luther King's Dream Act, the Voting Rights Act and burnt out its heart. The Supreme Court ruling striking down that key section of the 1965 Voting Rights Act has prompted some new moves in Texas, Alabama, Mississippi, and North Carolina. Florida began a purge of 181,000 Hispanics from its voter rolls as illegal aliens. Would black people still have the right to vote? Not in South Carolina. Every election in our state now requires photo ID before you vote. In fact, just hours after the court eviscerated the Voting Rights Act Alabama passed a law requiring voters to have a drivers license or ID from a motor vehicle office to vote. Then the state shut down most of the motor vehicle offices in the 10 black belt counties. When the Supreme Court struck down Section 4b of the Voting Rights Act that was a powerful setback. The 1965 Voting Rights Act banned all forms of racist trickery in voting. A state couldn't adopt a scheme like crosscheck unless the state could prove it did not discriminate against voters of color. Not many states would dare try until the court ripped out the key section of the Voting Rights Act and almost overnight crosscheck spread like a virus. The court's republican majority said racial voting trickery is gone, blatantly discriminatory evasions are rare and Jim Crow practices have been eradicated. Is that Sanders' experience? I literally went to vote and my name was not on the voting list. How odd sine Attorney Sanders is also the honorable Senator Hank Sanders, representing Selma. But I had been on the ballot in a number of years and my name wasn't on the voting list. It's a half century after Martin Luther King was here and I'm back in Selma, Alabama investigating suppression of the black vote. What the hell happened to my country? We have a long history of suppressing the black vote. We also have a long history of suppressing the poor vote. But all of that is being magnified now by these various kinds of institute who have devised all of these modern day ways to be able to diminish voter participation. And of course, these are being funded by a few folks who have billions of dollars. They've found ways not to pay taxes and now they are using those same dollars to be able to take away the right to vote from poor folks and black folks and other minorities. The Supreme Court case against the Voting Rights Act was brought by Shelby, Alabama. So where did poor little Shelby get the cash to bring the case? The money behind Shelby came from Project on Fair Representation and the money behind Project it came from Donors Trust and the money behind Donors Trust, Koch. So it was Koch money behind the hit on the Voting Rights Act and that let crosscheck loose on the entire USA. Look who flocked up with the Kochs to attack the Voting Rights Act. The Manhattan Institute whose chairman is Paul Singer, The Vulture. So, some billionaires are spending their loot on destroying Martin Luther King's Voting Rights Act. Well, there aren't enough white guys to elect Donald Trump nor a republican congress. So you've gotta get rid of the unwhite guys. Crosscheck, all those other voting tricks, you eliminate a few million voters of color and you've got your tax break, you've got your pipeline, and you've got nothing between you and your next billion. Is vote suppression just another profit center? USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. No one saw it coming, not even the polls. But you saw it coming. John Paulson of Paulson and Co., Rebekah Mercer, who's the daughter of Robert Mercer. The billionaires won. How? I went to Michigan to find out. Trump officially won this state by just 10,000 votes but 75,000 votes were never counted, vanished in the snow. Now how do you lose 75,000 ballots? I found out that the answer was in the bubbles. It said you had to put in the fill in the bubble. I'm sorry. As it turns out, Michigan machines couldn't read the bubbles on 75,000 ballots because 87 machines broke down. They broke down in Detroit and in Flint, African American cities. Now these cities were bankrupt and so they were under the control of republican appointed operatives from the state and they refused to spend the money to replace the machines before the election that they knew were broken. And so I went to the attorney general to ask him what happened to the missing ballots, what happened to the missing voters. I just want to get the attorney general's view what happened with the recount. Machines broke, but the human eye could've seen voter's choices in a hand recount but Donald Trump's lawyers flew to Michigan and stopped the recount cold. Remember those long lines of souls to the poles in Ohio? They were back in 2016. Can you believe this? State after state after state crosschecked supposedly to stop voter fraud. Do you believe that there's fraud in Michigan? Well, we've been very aggressive in closing vulnerabilities and loopholes. I see the aggression. So who won? Who really won? Now, the U.S. State Department uses exit polls as the way to measure whether an election is honest and according to the exit polls Trump lost. There was a path to 270 that Hillary Clinton... How could the exit polls be different from the official count in these GOP states? Because a voter can walk out of polling booth and say exactly how they voted but they have no idea if their vote counted. I mean, what's next? This is what's next. With a plan for 2018 and 2020, after the election, Kris Kobach met with the president elect to secretly discuss restoring Kobach's Muslim tracking program and sneak the crosscheck program into the Department of Homeland Security and spread crosscheck to all 50 states. Arizona, Alabama, and Georgia. But we should be doing this in all 50 states. How do you defeat voter suppression tactics when it's fueled by billionaires cash and partisan power? The same way the Voting Rights Act was first won 50 years ago. One side literally had everything. They had all of the laws and lawmen. They had all of the guns. They had all of the banks and money. And the other side didn't have anything. But yet, we took marching feet, we took singing songs, and we took praying prayer, and was able to forge a great victory. The Voting Rights Act was won here on this bridge over the Alabama River when Reverend Martin Luther King came to the town of Selma, Alabama. And so I marched the last leg of the Selma to Montgomery March with about 35,000 other people. And what I remember so graphically was Dr. King saying how long and eventually the crowd was saying not long. - They introduced Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Everybody got quiet and he was telling our parents how it was time for them to get the right to vote. When we got to the top of the bridge then you could see, really see what was on the other side. And there were white people sitting on their cars with their Confederate Flags and their banners Die Nigger and Go Home Coon. I heard these pops, pop, pop, pop. This gas came and with this gas you couldn't breathe, you couldn't see. I ran into this big old thing of tear gas and he was running behind me with the billy club kind of thing. When I woke up, they had me on a stretcher putting me in the back of a hearse. I just jumped up and before anybody could catch me, I was headed back cross that bridge. Judy was older than me so if I was 11, she had to be like 12 maybe going on 13, I think. And she starts walking, nobody's gonna stop me from getting my freedom. And soon as she said freedom, one of the troopers hit her and blood just went everywhere. And I mean, I was just in horror. Different people in the group would just strike up and start singing and then others would join in. Deep in my heart, I do believe we shall overcome someday. That was the hope, that was the hope of that song.
