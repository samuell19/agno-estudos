[ Motorcycle ] [ Music ] [ Running Water ] [ Choking and Moaning ] [ Coughing ] [ Heavy Breathing ] [ Music ] - You're a fucking pig. Seriously, I've never seen a girl get after it like you. Is there anything you don't eat? - Pussy. - Don't knock it till you try it. - I have. - I'm kind of surprised you agreed to come for the weekend. - It sounded fun. Why not? - Because I DM'D you less than a month ago. - You seem nice and I googled the fuck out of you before we first met. - Find anything interesting? - That some fucked up shit happened at this family house you're taking me to. - Wait, what, you knew about that and still wanted to go? - Why didn't you tell me? - Because I was afraid you wouldn't want to come. Why didn't you tell me you knew? - We just started seeing each other. Hey, so sorry about your parents' suicides and stuff. - Yeah. - But I am sorry. I know it's hard to lose your parents. - Sure you still want to go? - Kiel, you're cute as hell. You're fun, a pretty good lay, and you'd make a great boyfriend. So yeah, I want to go. - Cool. - Beans. [ Music ] - And the alien's frustrated, and he turns to the serial killer, and he says, do you ever feel that way? He goes, honestly, I love what I do, but that commute sounds like a killer. - You're such an idiot. - You're an idiot. That was brilliant. You got any grapes? - Get me a drink, girl. I said get me a drink, and I might just save your life. Wow. If you ain't careful, you're going to get more than you asked for. That's nice, right there. Yeah you're something all right. You got to do better than that, girl. Wow, Goldilocks is going to get wolfed tonight. Goddammit! Just wanted a fucking Pepsi. You fucking cunt. [ Screams ] - Harley! What the fuck? [ Music ] - Ray! Hey, Ray! Can't knock me down, Ray. - Can I ask you something? - Yeah. - Where did you learn how to fight like that? Girl Scouts? - Yeah. - Seriously? - You don't want to know. - I do. - You don't. [ Music ] I grew up in the middle of nowhere with brothers. They had friends. I had to fight. - For what? - At first, for my virginity. [ Music ] - Well, it gets pretty rough around these parts. So, be prepared to fight for your life. [ Music ] - This your family's place? - It's my granddad's getaway. - Bring all your girls here? - Honestly? - Yeah, honestly. - A lot. Yeah, I've brought a lot here. - You're such a slut. [ Music ] - Welcome to The Watchatoomey Valley. [ Music ] - Holy shit. - We're here. - Rich! - Yeah. [ Music ] For you. - Thank you. [ Music ] - Follow me. [ Music ] - This is great. - Hey, babe, babe, babe. Home sweet home. - It's empty. - Yeah, there's not much here. - Whoo! What happened? - We just stopped coming. Come on. Let's go. - Where are you taking me? [ Music ] - Here, here, here. - Oh. Is this your family? - They're all buried right there. - Your mom, your dad? - Everyone's right there. - Anyone still come here? - Just me. Now, it's time to let the neighbors know we're here. - Does that actually fire anything? - Like a cannonball? - Yeah. - No, dumbbell. - What? Wouldn't it be so cool if we could just like blow something up? - This is a blank. We used to jam stuff in here all the time when we were kids. My brother Rhodes put a rake in here one time. It almost took a kid's arm off. This shit will fuck you up. Put it in there like that. Here. Shove it all the way. There it is. All right, here. All you got to do, pull it. - Just yank it? - Yep. Pull it, pussy! - One, two, three [bang]! Holy shit! I don't have any service. - That's the best part about being here. There's a landline right there if you need it, and dinner will be ready in five. - Okay. Mind if I snoop around? - Yes, please. - Thank you. [ Music ] - Yo, Harley! Harley, baby! [ Music ] - Are these your brothers? - Yeah. That's Rhodes, and that's Ravener. - Do they still come here? - Not in a long time. - Y'all still close? - Ravener took his money after my parents died and never came back, literally up and left, and Rhodes died last year. - Whoa! Sorry, I didn't know. - And these are kids we grew up with around here, Townies. That there, that's Colton, she's a freak. No, not like that. There's Beau, and the guy on the end, that's little Vin, but don't call him that. - No? - No, he don't like it. Call him Vincent. - You really are on your own, huh? - Just me. [ Music ] And very fancy. - Very. - Cheers. - Cheers. [ Music ] - You want some of mine? [ Music ] I wish I never started this with you. - It's only going to get worse. - You're perfect, and I'm not. - What? What's the matter? - Nothing. It's like -- [ Music ] - I don't get it. [ Music ] You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. [ Music ] [ Knocking ] - I lost everyone, and it weirds me out to even think about caring for someone. I'll see you in the morning. [ Loud Bang ] - Kiel? [ Loud Bang ] Kiel? Kiel? [ Heavy Breathing ] Kiel? [ Heavy Breathing ] Fuck! [ Heavy Breathing ] Kiel? [ Music ] Fuck! [ Music ] - 911, what's your emergency? 911, what's your emergency? - There are people outside of the house. - Do you know how many there are? - I don't know. - I have your address from the line you're calling from. I've dispatched the police. They're on their way. - How long? - Due to your location, it's going to take nearly 30 minutes. I'm going to ask you some questions. Are you injured? Miss? Miss, I need to know if you're hurt. Are you alone? - They killed him. - Tell me exactly what happened. - My friend, I don't know. I heard a crash and I came downstairs. - Listen to me. You have to hide. [ Music ] Is there anything you can use to protect yourself? - There's a gun in the house. - Good. That's really good. Do you know how to use it? - Yeah, I know how to use it. - Can you get to it before they find you? - It's not far. [ Music ] - Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Are you ready to play? Good. Okay. [ Music ] So, here's how this goes. First, we fucking brand you. [ Music ] Then we'll let you loose like an animal, and then we party. Oh, you want a little pre-party. I like to party. I like to party a lot. [ Music ] You are totally fucked. [ Music ] [ Screams ] [ Music ] - Howdy, motherfucker. - What the fuck. - Got you something. It's nice. Let's play catch. Ouch! You shot me with no bullets, you fucking retard. [ Music ] Harley. What are you doing in there? Scrubbing your tits? Can I join? [ Music ] Cheeky Monkey. [ Music ] Fuck! [ Music ] - Is that you? - You're okay? Were you attacked? Tell me what happened. Are you injured? Are you okay? Harley. Do me a favor, make a sound if you're okay. If you can't answer, try with anything you can. Harley, do me a favor, try to make some sound, so I know you're there. [ Music ] [ Music ] - Fucker! Fuck! Thought I had you. Stupid fucking bitch. [ Music ] - Hey, it's Wanda. Can't get to the phone right now, because I'm fucking busy. I'll call you back. [ Music ] - Beau, What the fuck? Beau. What the fuck, Beau. Jesus, are you okay? Whoa, what the fuck are you doing? It's not funny. Put the fucking gun away. Cut it out, you fucking psycho. It's not funny. Put the fucking gun away. Cut it out, you -- God, what the fuck! Fuck! [ Music ] It's you! Oh, that's good. You're not going to make it out of here alive, you fucking idiot. - Shut the fuck up! [ Laughter ] I said shut the fuck up! Who else is out there? Fucking tell me! Who's out there? - They're coming for you. They're all fucking coming for you. - Who? - You're not going to last very long, you fucking idiot. - Tu eres la tonta, no yo. [ Music ] - They're fucking coming for you. [ Music ] I've been playing this game for a long time now. And you are nothing special. Do you know how many twats I've killed just like you? - None. That's why you're lying on the ground, bleeding to death. [ Music ] - They're going to kill you. - They're not. Try and stick around. You'll see. [ Music ] Despierta, motherfucker! Motherfucker! [ Music ] Tz, tz, tz, tz, tz. You're not going anywhere. [ Gunshot ] Where is Rhodes? Where is Ravener? When are your brothers showing up for the next act of this freak show? I'm only going to ask once more. Where are they? Kiel. Kiel, where are they? Where are your brothers, Kiel? - Ravener's dead! They have Rhodes. They've had him for more than a year. He came with his girlfriend for a long weekend, and they wanted to play this game, 911. Ravener panicked and tried to go to the police. They took him on the lake and drowned him. Then they took Rhodes. They're going to give him back. I have to do it. They make me do it. [ Music ] They're going to give him back. I have to do it. I have to do it. They make me do it. It was either you or me. - Get in the car. I'll take you to the hospital. [ Music ] You know they don't have Rhodes anymore. He's dead. They killed him. You know that, right? [ Music ] You don't look so good. [ Sirens ] [ Music ] - 911, what's your emergency? [ Music ] - Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. Kiel. - Wake up. Wake up! - Kiel. - Kiel. - Kiel! Wake up! Kiel, wake up. Kiel, wake up. Kiel. Get up and get the key from the cabinet. Get up. - I heard you! - What happened? - What do you mean what happened? - You are bleeding to death, and I'm chained to the fucking wall. That's what I mean. - She branded me. - I see that. - You know what she did to Beau? - No clue, don't care. - She cut his dick off. He bled out on the floor next to me, and then she dragged him into the kitchen and came out in his clothes and pretended to be dead until Colton came. - What were you doing lying next to her? Were you taking a nap? - She had Beau's gun, and you were late. - And then she figured it out and branded you. Kiel, get up and get the key from the cabinet. - My job is to lay there until you all show up. - You failed. You fucked it up. - She took the key. One shot. - What does it say? Read it fucking aloud, please. - Got one shot. Choose wisely. That's it. - So, Kiel. Kiel, I will be down here forever, and you're going to bleed out any minute. Please, it's going to take weeks for me to die, and you're going to be dead in an hour. Kiel. Kiel! Please, please just shoot me, so I don't have to stand here dying with you dead on the floor before me. Kiel. Kiel, you're tapping out, man. Kiel. Kiel, look at me. Take aim. What are you, what are you doing? You are passing out, man. Look at me. Take aim. What are you doing? Kiel! What are you doing? - Put your head next to mine. - What? - Just fucking put your head next to mine. - Oh, fuck! Fuck. Fuck. - Hey, Rhodes. - What? - Sorry, bro. - Me too. [ Grunting ] [ Gunshot ] Fuck! Fuck! Holy fuck! Holy fuck. [ Music ] Fuck. What the fuck? - I was not expecting the double suicide. - What a freak. - So sweet. It was really kind of him to try to kill you too. Mama raised you boys right! - She loved us a lot. We had such good times. - So great y'all had that tender moment right before he blew his brains out. - And you got to see it right there, like a proper psycho pretending to be dead laying on the ground next to dead people. - When in Rome. You miss him already? - So much. He was the best. - The best. A real psycho killer. Damn, was he good in bed. - Wow, you really are fucked, aren't you? But in a good way. I mean, we probably could've dated, been a regular pair. - Now, you're going to starve to death. Very painful, supposed to be one of the worst ways to go. - You know, you are a bit smarter than we expected. - Stop flirting. - No, we kind of figured we'd get the normal dumb fuck who had it coming. - How did I have it coming? I mean, I bet they didn't see it coming either. - Oh, sure they did. They all had it coming. There's a girl in there who convinced her best friend into committing suicide just so she could have her boyfriend. Right next to her, he poured an entire bottle of booze down his bestie's throat during Spring Break, put the car in drive, and pointed it right towards a Mexican cliff. Our prizewinner was a little cunt who had a kid sister, who got all the attention from mom and dad. So, she decided to smash her face in and let her mother go to prison for it. They all had it coming. - What gives you the right? - Me. I gave myself the right. See, I'm that well born. I'm that much better than they are. I decide. - Wow. - But you shouldn't have a problem with that, right? They had it coming, didn't they? They did, right? Hey, you killed one of them in self-defense, right? - What are you talking about? - Come on. We're having fun. We're being honest. Look, it's not like we're getting rid of any of the really good people. They had it coming, didn't they? The internet's got great shit. Kiel found you. He read about your incident in the local paper, and the self-defense made sense, but you know Kiel. He dug a little deeper, found the names of the other two guys involved, and well, they got off, but that didn't work for you, did it? Oh, no. Kiel realized what happened to those guys weren't accidents and he put it together that you tracked them down and sure as shit on the anniversary of your gangbang, you lit one of them on fire. You torched him like a goddamn Roman candle. But the best part is when you went on the hunt and you tracked that other fellow clear across the country in his apartment. - You like that part? - Big time. And then you shot him in the head, made it look like a suicide. It was clean, it was nice. - Did that bring that all home for you, you know, with your parents' suicides and all? - I like you. How old are you? You must be 20 something. You already had four kills before you got started here. - Three. - Sorry, what was that? - Three. - Three what? - Three! Not four. - I'm sorry; we actually count the abortion, too. Yeah, sorry, still counts. Oh, I have a question. Most of what I said about them boys you killed true? What gives you the right? - They had it coming. [ Gunshot ] [ Moaning ] - You're just the same as us. You think you're trying to do the right, same as everyone here. You're no different than me. - There's something different. - What's that, sweetness? - I'm better at it than you. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. One last thing. I'm coming to get you. [ Music ] - Promise. - Harley! [ Music ] You want some help with that? [ Music ] Come on! [ Music ] - Where are you going? - The game's over. - What did you say? - The game's over. [ Music ] - Who won? - Me. Motherfuckers! [ Music ] [ Music ] - What the fuck! Colton. Colton. She's dead, man. She is fucking dead. Where's Beau? Beau? Where's Rhodes? Where is everybody? That fucking bitch. Ravener, call them, call everyone. Did you find Beau? Bitch, I'm going to kill her. Kill her. [ Music ] Bitch! Fucking bitch! [ Music ] - What the fuck. [ Music ] [ Loud Pop ] [ Music ] [ Explosion ] [ Explosion ] - Hijo de punta! [ Gunshots ] [ Grunting ] - Harley! [ Music ] - Hold, please. Oh, perfect. Don't hold. Don't hold. Keep coming. Great! Oh, Shenefelt! Killer! Oh, nailed it! We're done. That was great. - Thirty-four Alpha. Take one, marker. Action! - Oh, we got a wild one! - Yup. That the kind of shit your brother got his Ding-Dong off? - Oh, big time. I'm fucking up.

Kinda shit that got your brother all bonered up! - Big time! - Kind of shit that got your brother all bonered up? - Woohoo, big time. [ Foreign Language ] - Take one, mark. - Woah!
