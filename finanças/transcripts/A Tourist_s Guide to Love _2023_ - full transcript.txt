Yes. Yes, it's gonna be okay, Mrs. Smith. Yes, I understand, we are working as fast as we can. God, I miss smoking in a crisis. Ah, bingo. Mrs. Smith just sent a photo. Well, well, well, what do we have here? No, seriously, what do we have here? Ah, that's it. Mrs. Smith, it is your lucky day. We know where you and Mr. Smith are. Ye... Yes, you have boarded the wrong booze cruise. Sure, I guess the tour group shirts do kind of look alike. Ooh. Yes, we are rerouting the tour now to pick you up immediately. [Mona] Never a dull moment. Well done, Amanda. Our other Monday crisis, Vietnam. It's on this year's list of top ten dream vacations. We keep losing clients to other companies because we don't have one tour bus on the ground there. Yet. I like this tone of intrigue. What have you got? Saigon Silver Star. It's a small, family-run tour company. The owner's thinking of selling. It's a little under the radar, but it's got fantastic online reviews. Who do we send as a secret shopper to see if it's worth bidding on? Well, I would like to send you, but I've a feeling you're about to be busy. - Busy? - Mm-hmm. John called. He wants to make sure you come home early, not working late. He's clearly got something planned, so I booked you a 4:00 p.m. manicure. Manicure? I'm... I'm not following. You're not following? You two have been together forever. But... I mean, five years isn't "forever forever." And he wants you to come home early all of the sudden. The man is clearly putting a ring on it. I've been married nine times. I know the signs. Don't question me. [chuckles] [indistinct chatter] What color goes with potentially one of the most exciting nights of my life? - So you're saying it's a special occasion? - Potentially. It's your hand. My boss Mona thinks that my boyfriend is proposing tonight. - Wow. Sounds exciting. - [Amanda sighs] I think, I thought... I don't know exactly what I thought, but I kind of feel like this day was never gonna come, you know? John and I have both been really focused on our careers. - He has a job? That's cool. - Yeah. He's an accountant. He's been on this really complex tax fraud case. - My boyfriend was in one of those. - Oh. But not as an accountant. Do you... wanna talk about it? - No. - Okay. Can't. Court order. Also, my bosses said manicure time is the customer's time, so... Tell me your big love story. Our first date was at a paint and sip art night. John paid with a coupon, which was cool. And then we painted sunflowers. Well, actually, it turns out we're both really terrible at paint, but very good at sip, so at least we had that in common. But I really knew that he was the one a couple weeks later when he offered to do my taxes. Taxes. Hot. It's his love language. [chuckles] Wow. So he's like a real, grown-up man. Exactly. And we're just... We're so comfortable together, you know? It's just... It's really good. I cannot believe that a year from now, I am going to be hitched. [chuckles] And I, like, I work in travel, so I will have hopefully planned and executed the ideal honeymoon, and we'll just be settling into our new normal. Maybe even looking for a house. Oh my God. Did you decide on a color yet? Oh, right. Um... Ooh. What about red? Red's a statement. It's fiery, you know? Who doesn't like a fiery statement? Or something different. More like a... Oh, a blue. Something borrowed, something blue. I don't follow. It's... an expression. Doesn't matter. This one. This is it. It's a classic. That's the color you wore in. Exactly. It is neutral, it is reliable. It goes with every outfit. I mean, this color is your wing woman. Okay. Hey, thank you for listening. No worries. Doing nails is just a side hustle. I'm actually a life coach. Oh. Helping people find their passion is my real passion. Well, I'm sure that you're amazing at it, but I feel like my life is finally on track and things are only getting better. - Stop doing that. - Sorry. [whimsical music playing] - [biker] Watch out! - [gasps] [panting] Uh. ["Forever and a Day" by Jeremiah Burnham playing] ♪ We will be toge... ♪ [song stops abruptly] John? Nope, just a devastatingly handsome intruder raiding the wine fridge. [Amanda chuckles] I don't think my boyfriend's gonna be too happy. Oh, well you should invite him. I apparently got enough sushi for all of your boyfriends. [both chuckle] So, uh... [clears throat] Mona told me to make sure I was home early. What are we celebrating? Wine? Sure. Cheers. Let's sit. [John chuckles] Um... Uh... Mm. [exhales] Amanda Riley. Here. [chuckles] Look at us! Five years. - We did it. - Yeah, that's a lot of mileage, you know? - Yeah. - Yeah, but there's... there's still a lot of tread on these tires, you know? - Good tread. - Because they're sturdy tires. So sturdy. And that's kind of how I think... about us. We're like a reliable American car. Uh, Blue Book never dropped, solid trade-in value. That's not the right metaphor. I'm nervous. Sorry. You're doing great, sweetheart. [sighs] Amanda. Yes. There are... so many different types of poultry... John, I'm gonna stop you. Okay? Uh... [clears throat] Look, you're just not a big romantic gestures kind of a guy, so I am... I'm gonna spare you the trouble and I am just gonna say, "Yes." Um... Y-yes? I'm saying yes to what I think I'm saying yes to? You're moving to Ohio? Uh, so Reed called me the other day. - Reed? - Grad school roommate Reed. - And he's got a massive firm in Ohio... - Mm-hmm. ...and he asked me to head up the entire forensic accounting division. It's like a huge opportunity for me. So, am I moving? Technically, yes, "I'm moving," but like, I don't know for how long or what I'm gonna do, and I'm not gonna ask you to wait while I figure all that out. - Oh. - I'm asking for a hiatus. That's all. Everything stays the same. We're the same. That's why I was doing the whole sturdy car thing. Your, uh... Your manicure looks really nice, by the way. Um... They say that self-care is important when you're on your own. Not that you're on your own, just, you know, you should do it for you. [slams door] Okay. Amanda, I do... I recognize I probably could have handled that a little bit differently, and I'm sorry, I just... You know that confrontation gives me anxiety. Amanda, I'm sorry. I... I... I really didn't mean to hurt you. [cries softly] [John] I do love you, you know. [bittersweet music playing] [sobs] Hiatus? I mean, Amanda Riley does not get put on hold. - Not this woman. - Amanda Riley does not get put - on the back burner like a side dish. - Not her style. Amanda Riley does not get postponed like some weird elective surgery people are too polite to ask about. Oddly specific, but I'm following. You need to get out of town. We are sending you to Vietnam. Wha... Right, just take a dream vacation right after I get dumped. Exactly. Explore a beautiful country to forget somebody ripped your heart out into a million little pieces. - [sighs] - You go be our undercover secret shopper. The next tour leaves in two days from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi for Tet, the Vietnamese new year. New year. New year, new me, starting with putting Tourista on the map in Vietnam as a tour company to be reckoned with. - I like your bounce back. - Totally faking it. I have assembled the dream Vietnam itinerary. Every site a tour needs for a five-star experience. You go and be our eyes and ears on the ground. What sort of company are we purchasing? Get back out there and show the world who is Amanda Riley. [emotional music playing] [muttering] [indistinct chatter] [speaking in Vietnamese] [Amanda] Hi. Uh... [in Vietnamese] Do you know my suitcase? Hành ly'? Suitcase. - [in English] With the... Hành ly. - Oh, hành ly. - The hành lys, and then they go around. - Oh, baggage claim. Yes! [chuckles] You speak English. - Yeah. - Right. - Wanted to see how far this was gonna go. - [chuckles] Saigon Silver Star. I'm Sinh. Sinh Thach, your new tour guide. I feel like you could've opened with that. Could've. [indistinct PA announcement] Just to confirm, are you certain that's not your bag? [man] Next. Just so you know, there's a better way to do this. I know a guy who knows a guy. Wait, you know a guy who knows a guy who... Who can get your bag back. [chuckles] That's okay. I think we should just leave it to the airline professionals. Okay. [man] Next. Hi, I'm Amanda, and you are? Yes. Really great at your job. Employee of the month every month, I bet. Why did I do that? Anyway, hi, I seem to have lost my bag. It is a silver bag, it is a roller bag, and I really need to get it back as soon as possible... We will call you. Oh, okay, great, like in an hour? Maybe two... Next. Thank you so much. Yes. Right. Hi. [humming] [Sinh] Hey! Hey, finally. I was about to give up on you two. Amanda, my cousin, Anh. Her dad, my uncle, owns Saigon Silver Star. Oh, so that kind of makes you Sinh's boss. [Anh, chuckling] Hey. I like your style. Um, no luggage? It seems like the airline might have lost my bag. Don't worry, Sinh knows a guy. So I've heard. [woman speaking Vietnamese] Corporate tour groups. Joke's on them. They're not gonna experience the real Vietnam, not like you. Right. Do, uh, do you guys happen to offer welcome water? We'll get some at the hotel. Could we go over the itinerary on the way? Just relax and enjoy the view. Sinh handles everything. Okay, and, uh, what do you do? What I do best. I drive. ["GPS" by Pixel Neko playing] Thank you. Wow, this is a great view. [Sinh] It's even more amazing from the roof. We have a group meet and greet at seven o'clock. Are we gonna go over the itinerary then? There's just so much to see. I mean, Notre Dame, Saigon Central Post Office... Slow down, slow down. I decide the schedule. You chose a tour, remember? That means no homework. Does that mean you're not even gonna peek at my beautifully prepared agenda? It has tabs. Sure. Is there anything else you need before your bag arrives? Let's see if it arrives. Oh. You have zero faith. No, you're right, I absolutely do not, which is why I always pack both my toiletries and... [sighs, kisses] ...a clean shirt in my carry-on. - I'm impressed. - Well, what can I say. I was a Girl Scout. Thin Mints or Samoas? - Samoas, of course. - Samoas? - Yeah. - No, Thin Mints all the way. What? Silly me over here thinking we could be friends. [chuckles] So, how do you know so much about Girl Scouts? I spent a big part of my childhood in the US. Many Thin Mints were consumed. I'll see you up there. Oh, and, whatever you do, don't nap. Fight it at all cost. It's the only way to survive jet lag. Okay. Scout's honor. Don't nap. [door closes] ["Cho Không" by Suboi playing] Someone napped after all. [sigh] I... I know you said not to. I woke up. I felt like I didn't even know my own name. - I can help you with that. Amanda Riley. - Mm. I can also help you with a drink. Does it have a name? Uh, white wine? Mm. Group's right over there. Hi, I'm Amanda. Hi. I'm Sam. This is my wife, Dom, and our daughter, Robin, and these are their phones. Hello? Excuse me? We flew halfway across the world for this trip. Oh, I have to get off my phone but Mom doesn't? Hey, Mama's right, this is family time. Thank you, says my wife who is still sending work emails under the table. I'm sorry. We're very civilized, I promise. I will pocket mine in solidarity. Hi, guys. Meet my live stream. - Hi. - Hey. Look, hon, someone your age. He's allowed to use his phone. Hi, I'm Alex. The phone's for vlogging. I've got folks on Facebook Live along on the adventure with me. Hi. Alex, come on, sit down with us. Tell us about yourself. Well, I'm taking a gap year before I start at Iowa State for agricultural engineering. - Go Cyclones. - [Sam] Oh, wow. [Brian] Hello there. - Hi. - Hi. Sorry we're late. Someone "accidentally" took a nap. Guilty! [chuckling] We're the Conways, Brian and Maya. - Hi, welcome. - Hey. - [Sam] Nice to meet you. - So, uh, what brings you to Vietnam? Well, it's... it's our honeymoon. [Brian chuckles] Your honeymoon? That's so romantic. Well, we got married 40 years ago, but we were broke then, but now we're retired, so here we are. - Better late than never. - Oh. [Brian chuckles] And what brings you to Vietnam? I just needed to get away. Yeah, just... [exhales] You know? You just got dumped, didn't you? What? I... What makes you... What makes you say that? I mean, you're traveling alone, making smart alcohol choices. Obviously a man very foolishly allowed you to slip through his fingers. I just really needed a vacation. You know? Just anything to get away from work, right? What is your line of work? Uh... I have an idea. This will be fun. How about we don't talk about work at all, and at the end, we can all guess what everybody does? - Oh, no work talk. - Okay. I like the sound of that. I bet you don't wanna talk about it 'cause you can't. You're detail-oriented. You've got travel experience. Let me guess. - You're an assassin. - [all chuckle] Spy. Stylish fugitive. I can confirm or deny nothing. [all chuckle] It'll all come out in the end. Welcome to the Saigon Silver Star Family, which happens to be my family. You're especially lucky because your trip lands on Tet, which, if you read your guidebooks like someone here... You would know that it is the most important celebration in Vietnamese culture. [Sinh] That's right. It's a time for letting go of the past year and opening yourself up to new possibilities. Is there like a traditional Vietnamese toast? We usually say, "mot, hai, ba, yoo," which is sort of like, "One, two, three, go." [all] Mot, hai, ba, yoo! [all laughing] [Sam] Cheers. Guess what just arrived for you. Really? The suitcase, right? - We're both talking about the suitcase? - Yeah. Thank you. Told you I knew a guy. [exhales] Mr. Saigon Silver Star has some tricks up his sleeve. I can confirm or deny nothing. [Amanda] Then I ended up miming a baggage carousel, which is harder to do than you'd think by the way, before he revealed that he speaks perfect English. You cannot stop talking about this Sinh character. But is he yummy? Okay, we are grown women. Why do you use words like that? [Mona] Oh, whatever. I just am excited about the prospect of you getting back into the saddle after a big breakup. All right, fine, he's very handsome, but Sinh, his family owns Saigon Silver Star, so he is a terrible candidate for a vacation romance. [Mona] Oh, don't be such a prude. Anyway, fill me in. We are going on a cyclo-tour of Ho Chi Minh City this morning. That sounds more fun than my night. I'm trying to spring one of our clients from a Paris jail. What ding-dong shoplifts at the Louvre? [chuckles] Good luck. [gentle music playing] So, never heard the real answer. Why Vietnam? Oh, it's the number one tourist destination. Beyond the obvious top ten list, why Vietnam for you? - Uh... - All right. It's gonna be you and me stuck here together all morning. Might as well get to know each other. You know, just going through something kind of personal, had to get out of my regular routine, right? Traveling's good for that. It forces us out of the comfort zone. I, uh... Yeah, I used to travel a lot for work, but now I'm mostly chained to my desk. - [bang] - Oh! - Uh, you okay? - Yes. Yeah. [chuckling] Um, well, if you must know, - I've been doing my research on Tet. - Mm. - No, no, no, no! - No, no. Put that guidebook away. - Why? - It's for tourists. - I'm a tourist. - No, you're a traveler. What's the difference? A tourist wants to escape life, a traveler wants to experience it. What's bad about occasionally wanting to escape your life? You never know how long life's gonna be. Why waste it on escape? Spend it on experience instead. Marketplaces like this are the center of commerce in Vietnam. It's also the focus of community life. Now, you could buy anything here, from local artwork, to the latest design, to fresh fish. Now, who likes to shop? Me. Trick or treat bags. Oh, yay! Here you go, here you go. I'm gonna do some major damage today. Thanks for the dough, Mom. Wait, what? How much money did you give her? - Thank you. - [Dom] I don't know. How much is ten million dong? What? That's ridiculous. ["Tình Mo" by Phuong Tâm playing] [indistinct chatter] Oh. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. All right, here we go. [Alex] It's really yummy. - Alex, what do you got there? - Here, smell. - [coughing] - [laugh] Delicious. It's durian. So popular in Asia. - It's famous because of its aroma. - Mm. Mm-hmm. You can really smell it. You should see your face. I can rewind it if you want. No, please don't. It stinks, but it tastes so good. It's tasty, for real. Try it, please. Try it. I... I'm okay. Try it. Okay. Sure. Looks... - Just pick it up? Just pick it right up. - It's big. Okay. It's like a banana... [clears throat] I don't know how, but it's actually really good. - Yay! Wow! - Yay! She likes it! The Phoenix. It's a sacred creature in Vietnam. It symbolizes regeneration and new beginnings. - It's perfect. I'm gonna get it. - Yeah? [in Vietnamese] How much for the scarf? - Ten dollars. - Ten. - [in English] She says it's US $10. - Great. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing? Buying a scarf. No. You gotta bargain first. We'll say five dollars. It's just a couple bucks. I can pay. It's not about the money. She's trying to play you. First, you bargain. [in Vietnamese] Excuse me. How about five dollars? - I can't sell it for five dollars. - [Sinh] It's only five dollars. Mm. [in English] If she doesn't accept the price, we walk away. They always give in before we get too far. Ah, so if you really love something, give it away, and if it comes back to you at a cheaper price, then it's fate? It's all about the walkaway. Okay, let's do it. No, thank you. [playful music] - She's not calling after us. - [Sinh] Keep walking. Just keep walking. [Amanda] Okay. Ah... She didn't give in. Oh. Some sellers are stubborn. Hey, it happens. Next time. Hey, I'll meet up with you guys outside, okay? Where you going? I'm getting that scarf. Okay, see you outside. Hey! We're over here! Hi! I see that. Um... Where's the crosswalk? [Sinh] No, there's no crosswalk. Just stick your hand out and walk nice and slow. You'll be fine, come on. Here? [Sinh] Yeah. Uh... no. I don't want to do that. - You'll be fine, come on. - [Amanda] I... I'm fine here. I like it here. This is good. [playful music] What... What are... [chuckles] How did you do that? The trick to Vietnamese traffic, always forward, never back. Mm. Come on. Let's go. Trust me. I got you. - Yay! - Yeah! - [Sam] I knew you could do it, girl. - Amazing. Thank you. I never could have done that on my own, ever. Do you always sell yourself short? [scoffs] I'm not selling myself short. I just... I know my limitations. So don't limit yourself. Hoi An, here we come! [uplifting music playing] [phone chimes] Here you go. Thank you. Hey, um, about tomorrow. Wild guess, you have an exhaustive list of tourist sites for me to take a look at. Uh, I wouldn't call it exhaustive, I would call it comprehensive. - Okay. - It's right here. You can just scroll. There's no way we'd be able to see everything on that list. You're the one who told me not to limit myself. I've been leading tours for a while, and there's things about travel you may not understand. Oh, really? Vietnam, it's hot, it's crowded. You could easily burn out. Part of the Saigon Silver Star experience is seeing where the day takes you. Where I would love to see the day take all of us is to a bunch of places on my list. You never do anything unexpected, huh? Be impulsive? Go with the moment? The last time I went with the moment, I grossly misread it and someone moved to Ohio. That's oddly specific. I just would like to stick with a plan. Hey, everybody, unfortunately the temple is closed right now. They are practicing for Tet. [group groans] Practicing what? [Anh] A lion dance. It's part of the temple's annual Tet celebration. That's too bad. It sounds amazing. Mm. [Sinh] Hang on, guys. I may know a guy. Let me see what I can do. [drumming] [gentle music playing] [Amanda] I'm impressed. You really did know a guy. [Sinh] You gotta have your connections. Like this bridge. It's called Chùa Cau. Japanese traders built it to connect with Chinese neighborhoods. It's beautiful. You're very good at your job. Wait. - Was that a compliment? - Yes. What are you doing? Savoring the moment. My first Amanda Riley compliment. Feels nice. Okay, well, don't get used to it. Oh, so it is a rare and special thing. I'm even more honored. As you should be. [Sinh chuckles] Come on. [Amanda] That is cool. - They just leave it burning like that? - Yeah, they just redo it over again. [gentle music continues] - I love this whole color scheme. - Right. I think it's really gorgeous. This store is just... Hey, can I get something made for me? I'm sorry, are you actually asking our permission for something? Well, I was actually thinking we could get matching outfits. You know, as a family? Oh. Sounds like an amazing idea. Cool, I'm gonna look around. - Who is this child? - I don't know. Okay, let me help you, Mr. "Same shorts and t-shirt three days in a row." I change my t-shirt every day, I just packed eight of the same ones. I like you in this orange. Oh, wait, wait, wait. This? Get a shirt made. Is that really my style? You do not have style. [scoffs] We're starting from scratch here, pal. Okay. [Sinh] No custom clothing for you? Oh, you know, I think I've packed plenty. What about Tet? What about it? I thought you were the guidebook expert? It's tradition to wear new clothes for the new year. Bright colors invite luck and prosperity. Huh. In that case, where do I start? All right. That's the one. [gentle music playing] Are you sure? I mean, that's just not what I usually wear. That's why you should wear it. Get out of your comfort zone. He's right, for once. Stop it. [indistinct whispering] Okay, guys, let's get to the hotel and chill before dinner. Okay. - [Sinh] We'll see you guys there, okay? - Oh, okay. [phone vibrating] [tense music playing] We're not chilling. We're not? I got something to show you. [phone continues vibrating] Wanna get that? Uh... Not at all. [Sinh] All right. Let's go. Since we didn't get to see all the sites on your list today, I wanted to make it up to you. By walking me down this dark, deserted alleyway? Hmm? I thought you were a fugitive or a spy? Where's your sense of adventure? My sense of adventure is on hold until you tell me where we're going. That's literally the opposite of a sense of adventure. [gentle music playing] I'm speechless. That's a first for me. I knew you'd like it. You know, this city is more than a list of tourist attractions to be checked off. Sometimes traveling is soaking in the atmosphere. All I can say is just wow. And hey, that's two Amanda Riley compliments for you. "Wow" is a compliment? "Wow" as in, "Wow, I think you actually really knew what I needed to see before I did." All right. That is a compliment. [exhales] I better pace myself. So, uh... how long have you been doing this? I mean, leading tours? Despite my expertise... [chuckles] - Five, six years. Not very long. - What'd you do before that? Well, my mom wanted me to stay in the US, get a suit-and-tie job. But I came back here after college, worked at my dad's restaurant in Hue. One day, Anh called, said her dad needed help with the tour business. I mean, I was hesitant to take the offer. Why? I mean, you're such a natural. The pressure to show visitors the best possible version of Vietnam. I mean, I was born here, but a big part of me is American too. And it feels so amazing to share Vietnam with the rest of the world. Once I did my first tour, I was hooked. Never turned back. Well, I'm glad. I mean, look at me. Who knows where I'd be without you? Still waiting to buy that scarf. Why did she hate me so much? I think she sensed a master bargainer in you. She saved herself. [Amanda] Yeah, that's it. [Sinh] There's one more thing I want to show you. [gentle music playing] [Sinh] Now, make a wish. What did you wish for? I can't tell you, or it won't come true. [chuckles] You really believe that? - Maybe. - [chuckles] Apparently you don't, so tell me, what did you wish for? Top secret. See? You believe the same thing. It's good to cover my bases. Just in case. [gentle music continues] [Robin] Not like that, hold it higher. For a super camera dork, you know nothing about taking selfies. I prefer photos of things that aren't me. Especially not photos I'm taking of myself. That's because you don't know how to take one. Okay, look. Put it over your head. Look up. Almost, and there, go for it. [camera shutter clicks] - Whoa! - Oh! Yeah, that looks good. See? [Alex laughs] Thank you. Oh, that guy says he'll teach us how to row the round boat. Come on. [sultry music playing] [Sinh] Oh, what's this? Amanda Riley... doing nothing? Doing nothing feels, uh, very weird. - Keep practicing. You'll get better at it. - Right. [Alex] Hey! We're in the boat! Woo! - It's kind of scary! - It's not scary. Don't be a baby. [chuckles] - They look like they're having fun. - [Sinh] Yes. Let's go. In... In the saucer? [Sinh] Mm-hmm. So, when was the last time you did this? - Never. - Never? [Sinh chuckles] That's why I wanted to try. Okay, in that case, may I offer up a suggestion? I think just try to... Just try wiggling it. - Wiggle? - Like a rudder. - All right, you wanna try? - Yeah. - Wiggle, wiggle. No. - You don't do that. What I'm gonna do is more of a... Okay. Yeah, yeah. Okay, we are truly getting nowhere. [Sinh laughs] And don't say something deep and metaphorical about that. Nope. Never. You're just bad at paddling. Hey, here. Let me try. - No, I've got... I said I've got it. - No, let me. [Amanda yelps] [Sinh] Woo-hoo! - I can't swim! - [Sinh laughs] - I got you. - Just kidding! [laughs] [both laughing] [indistinct chatter] [phone chimes] [inhales] [Anh] Hey, guys! Sinh, bad news. There's a three-hour wait for the Golden Hand Bridge tickets. [group groans] Three hours? You don't know a guy for that? Hang on. Hey, guys, new destination. One even better than the Golden Hand Bridge. Better than the Golden Hand Bridge? Yeah, way better. [girls] Okay. Yeah, where are we? - Has anyone ever told you you're im... - Impatient? Yeah, my boss says that's why she hired me. Welcome to My Son Sanctuary. [poignant music playing] Wow. These are ancient Hindu temples built over the course of a thousand years by the ancestors of the Cham people. The Champa Empire ruled parts of Vietnam for many centuries. Their kings built these temples to worship the deity Shiva. Feel free to explore, guys. [reflective music playing] It's a wonder, right? I mean, how did they build this? There are many theories, but no one knows for sure. Embrace the mystery, being a woman of mystery yourself. So, My Son isn't on the usual tour? [Sinh] No. Everyone wants to go and see the Golden Hand Bridge, which is awesome, but this place, it's something else. [gentle music playing] I can feel it. It's kind of like I'm... transported to another time and place, you know? It's... It's not just another tourist site, it's... it's an experience. Agreed. I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I want more of this. I want experience. I don't want something in my guidebook. I want off the beaten path. Is Amanda Riley being... impulsive? Let's see. Shall we? - Morning, fellow travelers. - Hi. - Guess what? Change of itinerary. - Ooh, where to? We're taking an off-the-beaten-path detour. We at Saigon Silver Star take our customer suggestion box quite seriously.

The one who visits. Hey, I'm busy with work. I'm busy too, but I still find the time to visit and watch The Bachelor with her. She thinks I would be perfect for the show. Even during university in Australia, she called me every day. [in English] Suck up. [chuckling] Hey, guys, this is our grandmother. You guys can call her Bà Noi. [all] Hello. [in English] Welcome. [all laughing] Uh... [clears throat] [in Vietnamese] We are honored to be here. - [in English] Was that a sentence? - That was good. [in Vietnamese] You like this one, don't you? Finally, you bring a girl around for my approval. Come on, Grandma! We have guests! [in English] Sinh and I are basically related to everyone in Thôn Chàng. Which makes sleeping arrangements easy. Brian and Maya, you'll be with Uncle Hoa. Robin, Sam, and Dom, you'll be with Auntie Diem. Alex, you'll be with... [in Vietnamese] Tell Google Translate Lady she can stay at my house. [in English] Yeah. Amanda, my grandmother invited you to stay with her. Oh, great. Yeah, this one's good. This is called "Kho Bo." - Kho Bo? - Kho Bo. Try some. A little bit. Try a little. It could be a little spicy. [indistinct chatter] Yeah. Do you? Yeah. [indistinct chatter continues] [John] Hey, so you're probably not listening to this voicemail, but just in case you are, I just want to let you know that I get it. I'm an idiot. - I messed up big time... - Hey. How you doing? Hey. Uh... Good, good. So... [clears throat] ...when you said detour, you were not messing around. - It's worth it though, right? - Oh, absolutely. I mean, it's everything I ever imagined the Vietnamese countryside could be. Plus it has strangely fast Wi-Fi. [chuckles] - Grandma loves her Candy Crush. - [chuckles] You know, village life has changed since I was kid. But a lot of the old ways stayed the same, though. I know some Americans think of Vietnam only in terms of war, but it's just a small piece of our history. Definitely. So, um, how long will we be here? Until Têt, which is two days away. It's tradition to head back to your village for the new year. Ah. Well, I know your grandmother's thrilled to have you and Anh visit. Anh, yes. Me? And she'll keep me guessing as punishment. [both laugh] Bà Noi is a tough cookie. - You're afraid of her, aren't you? - Yes, 100%. She's all bark, no bite. Yeah, but her bark is pretty scary. What? Does Amanda Riley need me to protect her? Really? Protect me from Bà Noi? You think you got what it takes? Truthfully, no. [laughs] Sinh! I'm not cleaning up by myself. Come help. Now! Ah, so close to sweet freedom. - Sorry. - Goodnight, Amanda. Goodnight, Sinh. Sleep well. [romantic music playing] [door bangs against wall] Bà Noi's an early riser. I figured you'd be up. [Amanda] Um... - Are, uh... are those for me? - Yeah. We clean out the old year before the new one comes in. Fresh start. You said off the beaten path. ["Em Chào Tet" by Bích Phuong & Co.Opmart playing] [speaking in Vietnamese] [chuckling] [Alex] Wow. So cool. [indistinct chatter] [laughing] [laughing] - Yeah? - Wow. Bà Noi reminds me a lot of my grandmother. She was a tough cookie also. So that's where you get it. Definitely not as strong as she was. [sighs] She, uh... she passed two Christmases ago now. [softly] Sorry. You miss her a lot, don't you? Then this Têt, you send her a message. Pay your respects. I think she'd like that. The spirits are always listening. [tender music playing] What is this? Burning offerings, sending them to our ancestors, asking for their blessings. Hey. So I have Bà Noi's grocery list. Let's hit the road. What, on that thing? But it has no airbags or doors, or anything preventing us from hitting the actual road. Then you better hold on tight. [upbeat Vietnamese song playing] [laughing] [yelps] Oh, wow. What is this? Young bamboo shoots. You can eat this? I mean, it's very cool-looking. [Sinh] It's delicious. You know, this off-the-beaten-path detour has given me new ideas. Yeah? How so? My uncle's retiring soon. I'm hoping to take over the business. I wanna take Saigon Silver Star in a whole different direction. Challenge travelers' perceptions. Open them up to unforgettable experiences. I, uh... I think that's a great idea. Yeah? You do? Yeah. I'm having the time of my life, so... Me too. So, um... [clears throat] ...has your uncle ever mentioned... Hold that thought. Baby jackfruit. Bà Noi will kill me if it sells out. ...possibly selling the business? Right. [Sinh speaking Vietnamese] [sighs] [Anh] Hey. Just came to check whether you're okay. Yes. Great, thank you. Hello. [in Vietnamese] I want to talk to our visitor. - Are you planning to interrogate her? - No. Now ask. [in English] She wants me to translate. Oh, yes. Please, go for it. [in Vietnamese] What did she say? Ask her if she has her eyes on our Sinh. Don't laugh! This is important! [in English] She wants to know your intentions with Sinh. Are you single? Did she definitely ask that last part? - Nah, I did. I'm curious. - [clears throat] Right. Um... [clears throat] Yes, I am single. And as for Sinh, he is... I mean, he's so smart and funny and insanely handsome, but, uh, I live in California, so my intention is to be his friend. [in Vietnamese] What did she say? Mm. She says he is handsome... Mm. ...but she only wants to be friends. I don't believe her! This girl makes Sinh smile. I like it when Sinh smiles. [in English] Yeah, she doesn't believe you. You make her grandson smile, and she loves when her grandson smiles. You do like him, right? I... I just wish it wasn't so complicated. Why does it have to be? [exhales] This trip just, uh... just unfolded a lot differently than I'd imagined. Yeah. It would suck if it's our last one. What makes you say that? My dad wants to sell the business. An American company is interested. No one knows, not even Sinh. But, um, shouldn't he know? I'll tell him after the tour ends. Tomorrow's too big of a day. Right. Listen for a knock on the door in the morning. The first person to come to your house on Tet is a big deal. It will foretell your fortune's path for the entire new year. That seems like a lot of pressure on one door knock. Our traditions don't mess around. Goodnight. [bittersweet music playing] [phone chimes] [greeting in Vietnamese] - [in English] Happy new year. - Happy new year. Are you here to foretell my fortune's path for the new year? No. I'm here for Bà Noi. Oh, do you want me to get her, or... She's probably eavesdropping behind the door.

I still can't believe we're here. I'm sorry I never took you on more trips like this. I never cared where we were as long as we were together. Now and forever.

[laughing] - I'm gonna try it. - [Sinh] Try it. [cheering] Go Grandma! Yeah! [laughs nervously] Woo! That dinner with your family was so special, thank you. I had no idea that this tour could include something like that. Like I said, when you open yourself up to new possibilities, you'd be surprised where life can take you. I do feel like this trip has completely changed me. I'll take credit for that. As you should. I mean, we've completely thrown out the guidebook, and I love it. So, no more coloring within the lines? I wouldn't go quite that far. But there is just so much to be said for spontaneity, for throwing away your plans, for leading from the heart. But, uh, listen, the truth is that... I... I didn't just randomly take this trip, and there's something... that I wanna say, that I need to say. Is it, "Kiss me"? I... I... Yes, kiss me. [romantic music playing] Goodbye. Thank you for looking after us so well. You're so kind. Such a beautiful... - Thank you. - Uh... [clears throat] [in Vietnamese] Thank you for your hospitality. [gasps] Oh, oh my. I hope you come to visit again. - [in English] What does that mean? - She hopes you come back to visit her. Oh! I hope so too. Thank you. [in Vietnamese] Take good care of yourself, Grandma. [chuckles] Bà Noi. [tender music playing] Don't mess this up. I won't, Bà Noi. I won't. - [in English] Wasn't that so awesome? - It was crazy. I know! Oh, I like that one better. [Sinh] Hey, guys, we're gonna be at Hanoi in a few hours. There's gonna be plenty of time to relax and explore once you check in. Tonight, we're going to Thang Long Water Puppet Theater. - [Dom] Woo-hoo! - [Sinh] Yes. Followed by a late-night, authentic street food dinner. - Awesome. - [Sinh] We're also gonna be picking up a new tour guest at the hotel. More friends. [gentle music playing] [Amanda] No, go ahead. - Fancy camera and everything? - Yeah, I got you, girl. Alright, see you soon, babe. What? [phone vibrating] [exhales] Definitely. [John] Hey! Surprise! [John chuckles] Hey. So you know Amanda? Uh, I do. Hey, well, any friend of Amanda's is a friend of ours. [John] Thank you. Technically, I'm not a friend. I'm, uh... I'm her boyfriend. Ex-boyfriend. We... we broke up. Yes, yes, we did. We broke up, which is actually why I am here. [chuckles] To... to win you back. [bittersweet music playing] So, uh, h-how did you find me? Just followed my heart. No, really. I just called the tour company. [chuckles] Fifty thousand rewards points later, I had a plane ticket and a bus seat. I'm a forensic accountant, so we're sort of like the "James Bonds" of finance. Right. Well, speaking of James Bond, I am doing an undercover shop of the tour company, so do not mention to any of the others why I'm here. Oh, yeah, no, of course. It's so hot. I can't believe soup is so popular. And what's up with that boho hotel? It's not the usual Tourista vibe. It's cozy, and it's personal. I like it. Maybe it's the new Tourista vibe. So, uh... So, listen, there's... There's obviously an elephant in the room here, and I have spent way too much time ignoring that elephant. Wait, am... Am I the elephant? No, you're... No. The, um... The elephant, it's... You know, I... Sorry, I'm getting ahead of myself. I only just got here and I'm sure you're probably still upset with me. That's a good guess. I just want you to know that I have been doing a lot of thinking about, you know, uh, riding off into the sunset with you, so... On our huge pet elephant, of course. [chuckles] Just... Just... think about it, okay? - John is what? - [Amanda] Here. As in like, here-here. [gasps] This is all such a super swoon-worthy moment. I guess it is kind of romantic. You guess? That's not the heart-fluttering answer I expected. Yes, because... because I met someone else. Sinh. Ah! This story finally got good. Not that it was boring before, but it was, you know, your average, "My friend got dumped and went on a vacation" story. But now it's you and two hot men in a love triangle, and it's in Vietnam. Okay, I feel like you're getting slightly carried away. It's just a way more fun story to tell. Not that I'm telling anyone. At least anyone that you know. What are you gonna do? I'm... I don't know. I mean, Sinh is just... He's so adventurous and exciting. But John and I are just so comfortable together. - Boring. - And Sinh lives in Vietnam, John lives in Ohio, which is, I guess, still the same country. - Is it? - John and I were together for such a long time, and what if Sinh's just a vacation romance, you know? Not a real-life one. Let alone what he might think when he finds out what I'm doing here. Speaking of, I submitted our proposal for Saigon Silver Star Tours. Okay, wait, so is that why you're in the office at 2:00 a.m.? My God, yes, you know that I live here. The security guard calls me Mom. Okay, "Mom." Tell me when the Saigon Silver Star deal goes through, okay? We are the right company for them. If it goes through, will do. Right. Good luck out there. I'll talk to you soon. [exhales] Water puppetry has a long history in Vietnam, going back centuries. When rice fields would flood, the villagers would put on puppet shows to entertain themselves. Oh! Sinh, right? Yeah, you guys know so much about Vietnam. I know nothing about Los Angeles. It's literally our job. What's your line of work? Ah, uh... Forensic accounting. It's, uh... It's complicated. You use accounting to investigate fraud and embezzlement, and to analyze financial information for use in legal proceedings. See? So not that complicated after all. Okay, let's go. Okay. Thank you, Sinh. Hey. I just want to explain about John. You owe me no explanation. We kissed, so I do. We did kiss. It meant something to me. To me too. So you can imagine why I'm a little thrown by the arrival of your ex. That makes two of us. [sighs] The show's starting. Let's go sit. [traditional music playing] [chuckling] [audience applauds] [traditional music continues] [audience applauds and cheers] [Maya] I loved the fire and the dragons. I don't know how they do that! Those puppeteers were brilliant! Oh, it was so beautiful, and the music was wonderful, wasn't it? - Yes! - Baby, have you tried this? Oh my God. That is amazing. - Oh, okay, that looks good. - Oh, it's good. ...eating like this when I already do feel... I'm not gonna puke or anything. Okay. [Alex] Oh, it's been amazing... Sinh. Sinh? My dad sold the tour company. Your dad sold Saigon Silver Star? To who? An American company called Tourista? Ah...! Amanda, why didn't you tell me? Why would she know? Uh... - I'm sorry. No, I'm... - I'm... [Amanda] Uh... [clears throat] I'm a... I'm a travel executive with Tourista, and it is not what it looks like. I mean, it is, but it's not, and also, I can explain, all right? So... Sinh? Sinh. Sinh! Sinh! So this was all just business? Sure, it started that way, it did, but I had the trip of a lifetime. And all I want is for other people to experience that. Why would I believe anything you say now? Huh? - I feel like such an idiot. - No, no, I am the idiot. I am the idiot. I wanted to come clean and tell you, - but I didn't know if it was gonna happen. - Stop. Just stop. What does it matter now? [gasps] [bittersweet music playing] [John] I mean, aside from the Tourista drama, last night was so much fun. You know, the puppets and the crazy food on the tiny little chairs. Everything's so authentic and adorable here. But the best part was being here with you, which is lucky for me because Reed only needs me 'til the end of the year. So, we just do long-distance 'til then, I'm back in LA, and we can start... looking for houses like you, uh... like you keep wanting to. House hunting? I think that's quite a turnaround, because two weeks ago, - you were excited to be on a hiatus. - [scoffs] Yeah, no, I... Look... I mean, I would pay a fortune to take that back. But you can't and you shouldn't because we are where we are. Exactly. Here. It's funny, I think I was so horrified by the idea of marriage that I ran all the way to Ohio just to avoid it, but then I realized, if it's that important to you, I should be willing to make the sacrifice. But it shouldn't be a sacrifice, John. Look, if you wanted to be with me, it wouldn't even feel like a compromise. Hell, if you wanted to be with me, you would have asked me to move to Ohio. Look. When you left, I was lost. I was so comfortable in our little corner of the world that I never bothered to look around outside of it. And as deeply corny as it sounds, this trip has shown me that I wasn't actually lost, I just... I just wasn't where I was supposed to be. [exhales] It's, uh... This feels like it could have been an email. [Amanda chuckles] Possibly, yeah, but, uh... [sighs] You know, I'm... I'm so glad you're here. I really am, truly, because I don't wanna have this conversation with you through a door or over email because five years deserves better than that. Yeah. Yeah, it does. [sighs] Okay. Uh... I, uh... I should... probably book a flight home, and fast, you know, before I'm sitting in the middle seat for 20 hours. [gentle music playing] You take care, John. You too. I'm sorry I didn't tell you before about my dad selling the company. Are you mad at me? Look, I was chicken. That's not like you. I worry about my job too. I thought if I could ignore it, it would go away. Okay. That's more like you. I feel like I'm losing everything. The job I love. My dreams for the company. Amanda. Why are you giving up so easily? [in Vietnamese] I thought the new year would bring meaningful changes, but... I need to go... clear my head. I get it. I'll drive the group to the airport tonight. Thank you, Anh. [in English] No, but it was absolutely incredible. Bà Noi, the grandmother, she had me scrubbing these incense holders and... [Mona] Wait, I'm lost. You were cleaning a stranger's house, but this is the best trip you've ever taken? Yes! By far. I just... I felt like I was truly in the middle of it all, you know? Like we had a very authentic cultural experience, and I could tell the entire tour group felt the same way. We were... We were changed, we were connected by it, and I... I just know that our clients will feel the same. Sinh is the right person to lead us in Vietnam. Mona, are you still there? [exhales] That sounds perfect. I think we should go for it. Yes! Really? - Really. - Thank you. Thank you, Mona, truly. No, thank you. But what I really wanna know is, now that John's out of the picture, what's the deal with your tour guide? That's what I'm gonna find out. I will keep you posted. May the force be with you. [Anh] You guys have a free hour before we head to the airport, so stay safe and I'll meet you all here. Sorry, where's Sinh? He left. He needed to get away. Where did he go? - To be with his dad. - What? He's taking the overnight sleeper bus, but... he left this for you.
