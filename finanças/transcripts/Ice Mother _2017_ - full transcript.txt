ICE MOTHER ﻿-Mom? Hey. -Hi. Ivanek. ﻿-Mom, hey. -Hey. ﻿Virgin. Cold pressed. Top quality. ﻿Thank you. I'll keep it for my salads, whenever we have them again. ﻿You can even use it to make schnitzel. ﻿Those'd be pricy. ﻿Oops, the schnitzels! ﻿-It's always so cold here. -The furnace is always acting up. ﻿-And have you got the chimney swept? -Yes. Last week. ﻿-Hey, brother. -Hello. ﻿Hey there, Vera. ﻿-Welcome. -Hi, Mom. ﻿I could smell your schnitzels all the way from the supermarket. ﻿-Couldn't you just serve it from the pot? -The boys would be upset. ﻿You think they wouln't handle it if they had a normal-old pot oivt'he table instead? ﻿-What's wrong? -Nothing. ﻿-Go run some water over that. -It's ok. -Run it under cold water. ﻿That was their daďs style. Lunch, it should be a celebration. ﻿-Why don't you take your scarf off? -You aren't cold? ﻿-I am, but I'm quiet about it. -I'm gonna toss in some more coal. ﻿Mom. please. Don't. ﻿A little suffering won't hurt him. ﻿Sorry. There you go. ﻿-Bon appetit. -Bon appetit. -Ivanek, the food's ready. ﻿-Why do you let him play that stupid game? -He doesn't ask. ﻿-Ivanek. -I'm not hungry. ﻿You're not going to say anything? ﻿Ivanek? ﻿Mom? The soup is fantastic. ﻿-Thanks. -I thank you. ﻿Could you please tell your son to quit making those noises? ﻿Ivanek. we're all eating lunch. Come.on. ﻿Sorry, Ivanek. ﻿Dad'll give it to you once you finish eating, ok? ﻿How do you...? Here. ﻿Mom? Is it still worth keeping the house? ﻿-What do you mean? -It's impossible to live here. To heat it. ﻿-It'd need a complete reconstruction. -And where would I go? ﻿There's a little hotel near us. Total luxury. Privacy. A pool downstairs. ﻿During the day you could be at our place. ﻿So you'd have your maid nearby at your beck and call. ﻿-What do you mean? -Just what I said. -That Mom's our maid? ﻿-Excuse me for lack of a better word. -I don't want to listen to this. ﻿I'm against selling the house. It's the only thing holding our family together. ﻿-I'm gonna toss in some more coal. -Stay here. Mom, don't go. Mom! Don't... ﻿-Give that to me. please. -Get away. You'll get yourself dirty. ﻿Come on, I'll do it. Put that down. ﻿Has Petr given you back the money yet? ﻿A little bit. ﻿So nothing. ﻿Me neither. ﻿Did you notice Vera's worn-out shoes? Or what the girls are wearing? ﻿Where'd the money go? ﻿Does he have a lover or does he do the slots? ﻿-Come now. -Does Vera know how much debt he's in? ﻿-What should I take? -The salad. I'll slice the lemon now. ﻿-So I'll take both of them, OK? -Great. ﻿-Where is everyone? -I don't know. ﻿Kids? ﻿Kids! ﻿Where are you? It's lunchtime. ﻿Kids, where are you? ﻿-Do you know where the kids are? -Huh? The kids? I don't know. ﻿What are you doing here? ﻿I see. Is this someone's bunker? ﻿Yod've been found. Come on. Hurry up. Time to eat. ﻿What are you doing in this room? What are you doing in this room? ﻿Wait. Katka, what's in your hand? Who said you could do that? ﻿She has to ask you what she can hold in her hand or what? Leave her alone. ﻿-She had it because she was playing on it. -No, no. -Sure. She was playing on it. ﻿Just don't push it Petr, please. ﻿I don't want my children to be infected with this filth. It's the principle. Vera. ﻿I'll get the hairdryer. Try and dry it. ﻿-You overreacted, brother. -Why? ﻿You make enough. Buy him a new one. ﻿Who wants potato salad? Come on. ﻿Sorry. Come on. ﻿And schnitzels from Grandma. ﻿Say you're a cunt. ﻿Stand up when I'm talking to you. ﻿What'd I tell you? ﻿What'd I tell you? ﻿-Say you're a cunt. -Do it. ﻿-I'm a cunt. -Say you're a smelly cunt. -I'm a smelly cunt. ﻿-Louder. -He said louder! ﻿Yes. I thought I'd make steamed carrots. You like it. ﻿And what me beef or pork? ﻿OK. Bye. ﻿-What'd you have for lunch? -Why? ﻿-So I know what to make for dinner. -I don't care. ﻿-What are you in the mood for? -I said I don't care. ﻿Ivanek, look. A rhododendron. ﻿When it blooms in spring, ﻿it'll be really beautiful. ﻿Hello. ﻿-That's a nice tree. -It's a Serbian spruce. ﻿See how it's silver at the bottom. Interesting, huh? ﻿Ivanek! ﻿Have you seen a small boy here anywhere? ﻿No, I haven't. Sorry. ﻿What is all this? What are you doing here? ﻿Where are you going ﻿Ivanek... ﻿Wait. ﻿Is everything alright? What's wrong? ﻿Come on. Grab hold of me. ﻿-I can't stand up. -Come on. ﻿Thanks. ﻿And push him up. ﻿He always burns out. ﻿The idiot. ﻿Ludva, get him warm. ﻿-Come with me. I'll get you some clothes. -That's very nice but I''ve got a car here. ﻿-You'd dirty the seats. Come with me. -I've got my grandson here. ﻿-Ivanek, come on. -I'll wait. -He'll wait. Come with me. ﻿-How long were you in there? -A while. -Yeah. I see that. ﻿You idiot. ﻿Give it here. Better do some boxing. It'll do you good. ﻿-What's your name? -Ivanek. ﻿This is Adela. Hey. there's some grain over there. Pour it out. On the table. ﻿Watch. ﻿- This should be fine... - You think so? ﻿-Thanks. -I'll throw this right in the wash. ﻿-I'll wash it at home. -We've got a dryer. It'll be just a sec. ﻿I have to go. I have to make dinner at my son's. ﻿The only thing you have to do is die. ﻿Thank you. Have a nice day. We're leaving. ﻿Ivanek, come on. Come on, we've gotta go. ﻿-Come with me. I've got something for you. -Thanks. I don't want anything. -Come on. ﻿-You were frozen. I had you for dead, sir. -Oh, it wasn't that horrible. ﻿There are no "sirs" here. I'm Brona. ﻿Hana. ﻿My warm-blooded gals. ﻿Hey, show me the chickens that are laying eggs right now. ﻿-How many are there? -Twelve, like the apostles. ﻿Oh, and here's that wench, Adela. ﻿- She has a rough life... - Why? ﻿She thinks she's a human. ﻿-Ivanek, come on. We've got to go. -Why? Take this. I have to make the dinner. ﻿-Wanna go with us to Bolevak on Saturday? -What's there? ﻿We have a race. We're meeting here at 10. ﻿-Thanks, but we can't on Saturday? -Why not? ﻿We've got lunch on Saturday. ﻿-Thank you. Goodbye. -Goodbye. ﻿Come on, Ivanek. ﻿-Goodbye. -Goodbye. ﻿-Did you leave me any eggs? -Are 3 enough? ﻿Ivanek! ﻿Ivanek, stop it. ﻿You'll get dirty. Come on. ﻿Hi. ﻿Hi. ﻿-What are you wearing? -One of my friends let me borrow it. ﻿Where's the carrot from? ﻿-It's all rotten. -I'll cut that part off. It'll be ok. ﻿I think that we give you enough to buy good quality food. ﻿Where do you think our patients get their ulcers from? ﻿Should I bring the samples over to show you what we send each day to pathology? ﻿Could you clean the mess on the balcony? Tomorrow they're coming for it. ﻿Thank you. ﻿-Ivanek, aren't you hungry? -No. ﻿Look, what a nice little desk lamp. Wanna put it for your room? ﻿No. ﻿Really? ﻿It'd be a pity to throw it away. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿-Ivanek, explain to me what just happened. -What happened? ﻿You threw a tennis ball at Grandma. Why? ﻿Because she smells. ﻿Don't talk about your grandma that way. Come and apologize to her. ﻿-Ivanek, apologize to your grandma, ok? -Leave me alone. -Ivanek... ﻿-What happened? -He threw a tennis ball at Grandma. -Why? ﻿-He said grandma smelled. -You said yourself the old bag smelled. ﻿-The old bag? Mom used this word? -Yes. ﻿-I probably smell from the muck. -What muck? ﻿-I probably smell from the muck. -What muck? ﻿-I pulled an ice swimmer from the water. -Why? ﻿He overdid a bit. ﻿-Mom, can we eat dinner? -I won't. I've got a stomach ache. -Mom, can we eat dinner? -I won't. I've got a stomach ache. ﻿Hey, I get that your grandma smells. It's normal. Old people smell bad. ﻿But why did you throw a tennis ball? ﻿Did your grandma do something bad to you? ﻿What's going on, Ivanek? ﻿We'll find a child psychologist. ﻿His behaviour isn't normal. ﻿Ivan, what if we did dinner instead of lunch on Saturday? ﻿-What do you mean? -That I'd take Ivanek on a day trip. ﻿The ice swimmers have a race and we'd go with them. ﻿They're a really great group of people. ﻿And what do you need a group for, Mum? Are we not enough for you? ﻿I'd like to know what the temperature's gonna be today at Bolevak. ﻿-It definitely won't be under four. -It'll be under four and at night freezing. ﻿-Ivanek, draw one. -Last year it was five degrees at Bolevak. ﻿But now the winters are warm, it never used to be like this. ﻿We'd swim in the Vltava. There was ice. It was beautiful. ﻿-Too bad it's all gone. -Precisely. ﻿I also remember it. The Elbe was frozen and stayed that way. ﻿Do you have the Old Maid? ﻿take this one. ﻿So now I'll mix them up and it's your turn now. Come on. ﻿I wonder what the water temperature is going to be. ﻿-Three and a half degrees. -3.5 degrees Celsius. Good luck! ﻿-Bohous, how is it? -Good. ﻿The waters great. Excellent. ﻿Ok. Slowly. ﻿Grab your pant leg. ﻿-So...? Pretty good, huh? -Yeah. ﻿Ivanek! ﻿He'll catch a cold. ﻿Ivanek, get out at once. ﻿But it's healthy. ﻿-Come on. -It's ok. ﻿Do you wanna try too? Come on. Take your shoes off and come in. ﻿You know what? Put them here, ok? Good. ﻿Brona, this is ridiculous. 1000m? Will we have to pull you out of the water again? ﻿-And you're letting Ludva? - Nobody's pulling Ludva out of the water. ﻿Go for the 500. Go for speed and points. ﻿I'm doing the kilometer. That's it! ﻿Come on. Come on... ﻿The swimmers are already halfway through with the race. ﻿It looks like everyone'll finish within the time limit of 22 minutes. ﻿10.5 minutes have gone by. So we're rooting for everyone. ﻿And the onlookers are cheering, chanting. ﻿Yes, Brona is here. ﻿Brona! ﻿-Brona is signalling he can't do it. -Idiot. ﻿Rescue team, please come and help. ﻿I'm gonna get some tea, fellas. ﻿-You screwed it up again, see? -Have some tea. ﻿Come on, come on! ﻿Swim over to us. ﻿Come on. Here's the ladder. ﻿Come on, finish the race. ﻿In third place is Zdenek from Lysá nad Labem. ﻿In second Jakub from Brno, and the winner is Lucka from Příbram. ﻿An award today is well deserved by everyone who jumped in the ice-cold water. ﻿And I'd like to invite one person onto the podium who tried for the first time ever. ﻿and that person is Ivanek from Prague. ﻿Great! ﻿Hey. ﻿So how was it? ﻿Did you all enjoy it? ﻿-Hi. -Hi. ﻿Hi. ﻿Where's Petr and everyone?. ﻿They already left, Mom. They were fighting. ﻿Vera of course wanted to wait for you to get back. ﻿Why didn't you heat it up? Everything was ready. ﻿Eat without you? Have we really come this far? ﻿Hey Dad. ﻿Is that a medal? You won, did you? ﻿Did he jump into that ice-cold water? ﻿Only his legs. It was just a second, wasn't it Ivanek? ﻿You want him to catch pneumonia? ﻿He has a weak immune system. You want to kill him? ﻿He's completely hypothermic. This can destroy his kidneys. ﻿Thank you, Mom. ﻿Hold on! ﻿Give me your hands. ﻿Calm down. Breathe. It's ok. ﻿Never get in by yourself. ﻿Thanks. ﻿I'm like an icicle. ﻿Only icicles don't shake like this. ﻿Let me see. Come on. ﻿She's looking at me as if she hated me. ﻿She does. She's jealous of every old lady who comes around. ﻿Adela! Please. Get out! ﻿Shoo. Shoo. ﻿Did you hear that? ﻿Adela! ﻿Jealous bitch. ﻿Don't provoke me in public. ﻿-Petr? -Hi. ﻿Mom? ﻿That lipstick, are you serious? ﻿-Is it too much? -It's ridiculous! What's up? ﻿I'm going dancing, imagine that. ﻿-Where and with whom? -Am I being interrogated? ﻿I'd also like to know what you carried there upstairs. ﻿More books again? ﻿You owe me money, Ivan too. ﻿-And you're buying more and more books. -Mom, time is on my side. ﻿The price is rising. ﻿There's a future in it. Not some consumer bullshit but in the value of rare books. ﻿Sell it all. Return what you owe and take care of your family. ﻿Look at the shoes your wife is wearing. Goulash is on the stove. ﻿Come on. Hurry up. Have you seen Adela? ﻿-Brona, those chickens are always trouble. -But it's fun with them. ﻿She is doing it on purpose because I told her she's not going. ﻿You can't think about it so psychologically. Animals act on instinct. ﻿Fuck instinct. The beast knows exactly how to piss me off. ﻿Look, snow. ﻿Let's go upstairs. ﻿Adela, stay here. ﻿So, this is where I live. ﻿-What's that smell over there? -Jesus, the furnace. ﻿Where's the light? I found it. ﻿-Did you take the clean towel? -I did. Thanks. Have a sandwich. You must be hungry. ﻿I don't want any. ﻿Here's some wine. ﻿-No. I'm not going to drink. -Not even a little? ﻿No. I've already drunk my share. ﻿I don't even know you. ﻿You know what's strange? That I've known you a million years. ﻿Sorry... ﻿I probably can't anymore. ﻿That's ok. ﻿I love just being here with you. ﻿Come on. ﻿Come on... ﻿Now take a deep breath, and stay calm. ﻿Come on. ﻿Do it. ﻿Yeah. ﻿Swim around. ﻿That's it. ﻿-Mom. -Girls. Come here. ﻿Happy Birthday to you. ﻿Sing Ivanek. ﻿Happy Birthday, dear Grandma. ﻿Happy Birthday to you. ﻿-Thank you. -Mom, Happy birthday. ﻿Stay amazing and lovely. Here's a small gift. ﻿Thanks. ﻿The Chartres Cathedral. -﻿Remember when we were there with Dad? -In '83. I was 12. ﻿Are we expecting anyone, Mom? ﻿Come in. ﻿When we're inside. ﻿No, no. Leave your shoes on. Come on. ﻿-Hello. -This is Brona. -Hey, Brona. -Hey. ﻿And this is Adela. ﻿I had to bring her with me. She'd have been sad. ﻿So, Mom. Happy birthday. ﻿Wow, it's big, beautiful. Thai and therapeutic massage. But just for one person. Enjoy. ﻿-Thanks. -Happy birthday from me also. ﻿Vera, could you? ﻿I hope they fit. Kveta helped me. ﻿It's a swimsuit. ﻿-Mom, try it on for us. -No, don't. ﻿No. really. Mom. You have to show us. Go change. Please. ﻿-Not right now. -Really though. We'll do a group photo. ﻿-It's your birthday. -Try it on. I hope it fits. ﻿-So, what do you do, Bronislav? -Call me Brona. No need for formalities. Excuse me? ﻿-And what do you do if I may? -I take care of the docks our club is at. ﻿-You''re an ice-swimmer? -Yep. ﻿Why'd you say that to her? ﻿Yeah, I like it. It's happy-looking, isn't it? Hana? ﻿-How do you feel? -Well, I don't know. -Show us. Wow, it's good. It is happy. ﻿Happy? It's happy-looking? ﻿My God, Mom, please go and change. ﻿No, no. Mom, don't go anywhere. We're gonna take a photo. ﻿-No. -Come on. Everyone. Hurry. -No, why? ﻿Mom, here. Take the flowers. ﻿-No. -Take this off. -God. no! -Oh, please. It's off. ﻿Go on kids. Picture. Petr? ﻿-Not with me. -Come on. It'll be nice. ﻿Bronislav, bring the chicken. Come on everyone. ﻿-Put that back. -Why? ﻿I want to be happy. Mom has a happy swimsuit, so let her have a happy son. ﻿-That can be without alcohol, can't it? -No, it can't. -Vera, come on. ﻿-Please go there. Don't be a shit. -Thank you for the warning, Vera dear. ﻿Look here. Vera, jump in there. ﻿So, we're ready. ﻿Ivanek, try and smile sometimes, would ya? ﻿And CHEESE. ﻿You can stop that now. ﻿You're frowning, Ivanek. Stop frowning all the time. ﻿One more. Hold it. ﻿-Again everyone CHEESE. -Smile and look at your uncle. ﻿Vera, Vera. CHEESE. Birthday. ﻿There we go. ﻿You said that really well. ﻿Good. ﻿All done. ﻿-Do you want me to... -No. ﻿-We can eat, can't we? -Of course. ﻿-She's great. The chicken. -Will you take it for me? ﻿-Are we eating? -Will you take it for me? ﻿-I'm gonna go change. -Ok. -Ok? ﻿It's a chicken. ﻿With a beak. ﻿Can we play with it? ﻿-Cool, huh? -Yeah. ﻿Thanks. ﻿God, that smells good. ﻿Mom, is this some kind of new tradition? ﻿Are we celebrating like this now? With a pot? ﻿Have you ever tried pouring the soup into that bowl? ﻿I thought we were trying to maintain a certain level. Mom? ﻿Does this man influence you so much you use the pot instead of the bowl? ﻿I'm hungry. ﻿Are the vegetables organic? ﻿I don't know. Probably not. ﻿Oh. ﻿What does "oh" mean? Does it reek of non-organic? ﻿-Petr, control yourself. -Excuse me? ﻿-Cool it, brother. To each his own. -Not everyone has money for organic. ﻿A perfect example of your inferiority complex. Don't blame us you're not rich. ﻿That's your choice. You're the righteous one. Untainted. ﻿But then you sit in the museum in comfort, right? Like every other state employee. ﻿Nobody demands much from you, do they? ﻿Try having employees. Try it, pal. Maybe then you'll think differently. ﻿Pal? I don't remember anyone ever talking in such a way at this table. Clearly times have changed. ﻿But I still admire you for putting yourself out there in this world. ﻿-Bon appetit. -Bon appetit. ﻿-I think you helped me a bit with that. -Me? ﻿You taught me to avoid those stronger. That's my entire strategy. ﻿Think fast. I anticipate the attacks. ﻿-What does that have to do with me? -You don't remember teaching it to me? ﻿You don't recall throwing tennis balls at me saying 'Think fast, Ivan, think fast'. ﻿-You hit me right into face. -You're making that up. ﻿You're the one to complain. You're the victor, bro. And you know why? ﻿We live in a world where commoners win. ﻿Stupidity always triumphs everywhere. ﻿Is it just me, or does that person smell? ﻿How offensive. Compared to Dad, it's... ﻿It's appalling. ﻿Let's go. Get dressed. Leave that here and let's go. ﻿-Not I can't. -Why not? ﻿-It's my family. They're my sons. -They're dicks. Both of them. ﻿Their father didn't find the time to slap them, the spoiled dicks. ﻿-Don't talk about them like that. -So how? ﻿How are they behaving, your two little boys? ﻿And if they take after their father like you say, he must've been a huge dick. ﻿Don't talk bad about him. He doesn't deserve it. He was a refined person. ﻿Refined? A dick. Those are the best kind. I'm leaving. ﻿-Stay here. -I'm going home. I have work to do. ﻿-Ivanek, put that animal down. -Why? ﻿Could you, please take that animal away? ﻿Please do something with it. ﻿-I'm not eating here. We're going home. -Calm down. Calm down. ﻿I have a stomach ache. I can't eat under these conditions. Ivanek, come on. ﻿-I'm not going anywhere. -Ivanek. ﻿I'm not asking, ok? We're going. ﻿-Come on. You must obey your mom. -I want to sleep here. ﻿-We're going home. End of discussion... -Leave him alone. ﻿-What? How dare you. This is my child. -I'm telling you to leave him alone. ﻿Leave me alone. ﻿Fine. Finish eating. I'll take your mother home and come back for you. ﻿I'm gonna sleep here. ﻿-Bye. -Bye. ﻿Alright take some meat. ﻿Ok. I'll take this one. ﻿Do you want a thigh? I'll take a wing. ﻿-Do you want something also? -No. -You don't? ﻿Get that fucking chicken off the table! ﻿Move in with me. ﻿I really want you to. ﻿I can't. ﻿Why not? ﻿I feel like I'm in a museum. ﻿I'm sorry. ﻿We're independent people. ﻿We can be together whenever we want. ﻿Hey, scram! ﻿Fucking bastards. ﻿Go. ﻿Ivanek, come here. ﻿Look, give the bag a good punch, the best you know how, ok? ﻿So, get ready, and now. ﻿That was nothing. A real punch. ﻿Come here. Over here. ﻿You have to do it like this... ﻿Ok? Try it. ﻿That's it. Yeah. ﻿And now. Give it to me. ﻿A real one. That's it. Yeah. But be careful. ﻿Anyone can punch, but to take a punch, that's tougher. Try it again. ﻿Yeah. And now. Do it, come on. ﻿Hello, Bohemia. Moravia, and Silesia. We come to all those from Czechia. ﻿Welcome all Czech and Slovak swimmers! ﻿Around of applause. She's at the ladder. Slowly getting into the water. ﻿Others of you here are doing the 1000m, the biggest race today in Hradec Králové. ﻿-The water's an amazing 3.7 degrees. -Take deep breaths. Slowly. ﻿And here's Boženka. And more and more are finishing. ﻿Audience, let's cheer on the swimmers. ﻿And now Hana is nearing the ladder. ﻿Excellent. ﻿Congratulations. ﻿Yes, that's beautiful. A beautiful gesture. ﻿-Hurry up. -So, Hana, how was it? ﻿-Hana, how was it? -Great. -Congratulations. ﻿Great! ﻿Now to warm yourself up. ﻿Come here. Sit down. ﻿Close the door please. ﻿Thanks. ﻿You can congratulate your grandma. ﻿-I'm cold. -Yeah, but happy, right? ﻿Yes. ﻿Slowly start getting into the water and at the sound of the whistle, start your race. ﻿To all here today, fans and the public, all former swimmers and timers, ﻿we wish you a pleasant swim. So, once again we encourage applause ﻿tor the swimmers of our main race, the 1000m. ﻿Brona, you know you shouldn't. ﻿-I've trained for it. -I don't hold myself responsible for you. -I can't wait to pull you out again today. -Not today. ﻿-You got this. -Keep your fingers crossed. ﻿Swimmers to the starting line. ﻿Everyone ready... Start on the whistle... ﻿3, 2, 1 and we're off! ﻿And the 45th annual in Hradec Králové is underway. ﻿Starting out in the lead is Renata Nováková, the champ in Murmansk. ﻿You're done. ﻿Yes. that'll be Ludva. ﻿Even he sadly has ended in DQ. But that's how it ends sometimes in this cruel sport. ﻿And now we have Brona swimming up. Is it Brona? Cheer on Brona. ﻿Brona. Come on! ﻿Bronas at the finish. Cheer him on. ﻿Brona, amazing. Congratulations. ﻿Brona, great performance. Fantastic. ﻿Great. Brona, congratulations. ﻿I did it. ﻿Brona is the last swimmer today... this year in Hradec Králové... ﻿-Put it over me. -A time of 21:30. Really amazing. ﻿Brona, congratulations. Well done. ﻿Keep up that swimming. ﻿What's up? ﻿Hey, come on. Come here. The oven will be better. ﻿-Come on. -Ok. ﻿You have a robe for him? Throw it over him. Careful. ﻿Brona, warm him up. ﻿The stove is nice and hot. ﻿Go inside. ﻿-Close the door. -Okay. ﻿Fill this out. ﻿Sorry, Kveta, but this is wrong. ﻿When I add it up. 360 crowns are missing. ﻿Are you saying I stole it? ﻿I'm not saying that, only it's missing. ﻿You know what? Here's everything. I quit. ﻿-You overdid it a bit, didn't you? -No. -Here's 400, now relax. ﻿-It's not the money. It's the principle. -Yeah? Which one? ﻿She was fine before and now look at her? ﻿Brona. What's smoking here? ﻿Brona, stop! We're on fire! ﻿-Out. Everyone out. -Ivanek, out. Quickly. -The door! ﻿Away! Get away! It's gonna blow! ﻿-Boženka. -What? -Boženka. -Jesus. Take her. Help me. ﻿-The record player. Grab it. -Forget it! The chickens! ﻿-Forget the chickens! -Brona, no! -Forget the chickens. ﻿Get away from me! Let me go! ﻿Brona, forget the chickens. ﻿Come on. ﻿I can't do it. ﻿Come on... Brona! ﻿Where is your permanent address? ﻿Why? ﻿The doctors need to know. ﻿And why? ﻿Because of the money. ﻿You don't have any health insurance. ﻿I will pay the bills, you don't care! ﻿I wanna go home. ﻿Nurse! ﻿Wait! What are you doing? ﻿Lie, you have to lie in bed. Breathe slowly. ﻿You have to lie down. ﻿Breathe slowly. ﻿Fine. ﻿-Bohous, do it right. -What? -The corner. ﻿-It's golden. -Make it yellow. Take the corner roller. ﻿Shut up. ﻿-Hello. -Hello. Come in. ﻿-Hello. -Come in. ﻿Hello. ﻿-Where's my mother? -Somewhere back there. ﻿Mom? ﻿Hey. ﻿-Is Ivanek here? -Yes. What's wrong? ﻿Adela. ﻿Wake up. Eat. ﻿Adela. ﻿Hello. ﻿-What's wrong with her? -She's depressed. ﻿-The chicken? -Yeah. ﻿Depressed? ﻿Ivanek? ﻿Your mothers decided she's leaving us. ﻿Ivanek, get your things, and let's go, ok? ﻿We'll be staying at grandma and grandpa's. They're excited to see you. ﻿I'm not going anywhere. ﻿Ivanek, come on. Grandma and Grandpa love you a lot. ﻿I'm not going anywhere. ﻿Come on, please. ﻿See? ﻿What'd I say? It's pointless. ﻿You're so self-centered. ﻿-Goodbye. -Goodbye. ﻿Are you gonna feel sorry for yourself forever? ﻿Shouldn't you finally start acting like an adult? ﻿Come in. ﻿Hey, buddy. ﻿Brona, when are we going swimming again? ﻿-Brona. It'll be ok. You'll see. -Brona, this here's me. ﻿-Kveta. -Hey. ﻿-Come here. -Boženka. ﻿God, I love you. You're such a nice boy. ﻿-Hi. Brona. -Hi, Ivanek. ﻿Oh, Adela, you poor thing. ﻿-Where's Hana? -One moment. ﻿-Come on girls. Hi. -Hello. -Hello. ﻿Girls, take your coats off. ﻿-Hello. -Hello. ﻿-Hello. -Hello. -Hey. ﻿-What's going on? -Petr isn't here? -No. He isn't. ﻿Could I leave the girls here please? I don't want them to see. ﻿To see what? ﻿The repo men are at our house, They're repossessing the furniture and everything. ﻿I suppose the books are hidden at your place. ﻿You think I don't? He's got them hidden everywhere at home. ﻿I just found 2 wrapped in plastic bag behind the washing machine. ﻿-Hello. -Hello. -Hello. ﻿-Hey. -Hey. ﻿Can you tell me why there are repo men at our home? ﻿I took a loan. ﻿How much? From where? ﻿Do we need to solve it here and now? ﻿Where are we gonna live? What about food? ﻿We'll eat something and live somewhere. Vera, don't be so superficial. ﻿Now you slap me too, Mom, and it'll be ok. Right? Petr? ﻿I don't get what there is to solve? It's easy. Sell the books. Pay the debt. ﻿-I can't. -Why not? ﻿It's a collection. When it's complete, the value will double. ﻿And then the time factor. The price'll rise exponentially. I've researched it. ﻿Petr, you're delusional. ﻿Just admit you fucked up. ﻿How do you want to fix it? ﻿You want Mom to sell the house and pay for it? ﻿What? ﻿I hadn't thought about that. ﻿You all are selfish. Both of you. Just like your father. ﻿You take after him. You don't know how to be anything else. ﻿I pity you. ﻿And I'm not selling anything. ﻿1, 2, 3, 4, 5. ﻿-Once I caught a fish alive. -6, 7... ﻿-6, 7, 8, 9, 10, then I let it back again. -Excellent, and now... ﻿-Did you play? -No. -So play. He skipped you. ﻿2. Move two. ﻿Excellent. Close. What do you have? 1? ﻿Oh, now your turn. ﻿Four. Like your age, right? Four. ﻿So, four. We've got 1, 2, 3, 4. ﻿-We're going on a trip tomorrow. -What kind of trip? ﻿Where you're permanent address is. Tomorrow's Wednesday.
