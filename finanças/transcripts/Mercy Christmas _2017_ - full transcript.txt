Help! Help! Help me! Michael briskett. I'm never gonna forget that name. That is my favorite cut of meat. Mr. robillard. Wow. Um... Merry Christmas. L just finished the branch Compton assessments, and I was going to bring them to you. Really? I stayed up all night, but I figured you wanted 'em. You actually finished them that quickly? That is amazing. I really do like it here, sir. I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. Actually, I'm having a Christmas party at my apartment tomorrow night. Okay. Good for you. Yeah, it's nothing big. Just eggnog, secret Santa, Christmas Carols, maybe. I don't know. But this is the invitation. I've been passing it around. Oh, yeah. Can't do that. I got this big Christmas dinner thingy. If you find yourself in the neighborhood. I got big plans for you, briskett. Me? You're gonna do my breakdowns for my meeting on the 26th with quantum dynamics. The day after Christmas. I'm gonna need spreadsheets. Side-by-side transitions. Zero bilateral. Alphabetical listing. You know what to do-- just turn the geek speak into people speak. This is very important for me and the future of this company. That's a lot of work in a short amount of time, and with the holidays-- you'll get it done. I'm sure of that. Wait here. I will have the reports brought down to you. I need them done by Christmas. Christmas. Hey, Catherine. Which reindeer has the worst manners? I don't fucking care. ?Rude-mph .? Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer, get it? Yeah, it's stupid. Where's your Christmas joy? I don't do joy, and I don't do Christmas. Well... merry Christmas. Fuck all! Good enough. That didn't go down so good. You know... I'm gonna puke. No! Get to the bathroom. No, you're not. Not in here. Get to the bathroom, right now. Wait. I'm okay. I'm gonna be fine. No! ...with one brush. Watch as luster brush fits into tiny crevices, under sinks, counters... Tickets, tickets! I got tickets for you right here, man. Come on, come on, two for ten, two for ten. Take your girl out to a game, man. She'll enjoy it. Come on. I got tickets for you right here. Come on, two for $10. Two for ten. You sure you don't want it? It's the last game of the season. Don't do me like that. I'll give it to you for five. Come on, man, unfair. Fuck! Hey! Still got tickets? Heck, yeah, I got tickets. Are you Michael briskett? Are you Michael briskett? I'm Cindy, Mr. robillard's new assistant. Here's the reports he wanted you to have. Uh... thank you? And these. Looks like a lot of work. Yeah. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Hello? Am I too late to the Christmas party? Is it over? Yes. Ohh. No, no. I mean-- I mean, no. Great. So... So... So, can I come in? Yes. Yes, of course. Sorry. I saw the invitation on Mr. robillard's desk. I'm sorry. I thought everyone was invited. Yeah, they were. Sorry it's not much of a party. Is that eggrwg? I love eggflog- really? I'll pour you a glass. Thanks. Okay. Mmm! This is so good. My mom used to make eggnog from scratch. Really? That's-that's amazing. So, are you-you going home for Christmas? No, my-my mom goes on a cruise. Oh. Kind of a gift to herself, uh, every year. She's not really big on-on the holidays. Uh, but we talk on the phone, you know, when-when she gets back. So... Brothers? Sisters? Just me and mom. L-i think family is the best part of the holidays. I'm actually headed home tomorrow to see mine. That's nice. Refill? Do you mind if we... Kick it up a bit? I' okay. White Christmas. No way. That's my favorite too! Really? We watch it every year after presents. My brother hates it, but I love it, so... Speaking of presents, let's do secret Santa! Uh... won't-won't be much of a secret. Ah, who cares? Come on, it'll be fun. Come on. Yeah, why not. You go first. I wanted to get something practical. Thank you. You know, I can use this. Your turn. Open it. It's my mother's special Christmas cookie mix. I'm going to make them from scratch this year. Wow. Yeah, sort of a holiday treat for my family, since, uh, she passed away. I'm-I'm sorry. It's my first Christmas without her. What am I doing? I'm ruining the party! No. No, no, no, no. Um, it's-it's okay. Uh, can-can I get you some more eggnog? You know, um, I'd better get going. Actually, I'm feeling a little tipsy. I really did have a wonderful time tonight. Me too. Thank you. Okay. Okay, then. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. See ya. Bye. I know this might sound crazy, but I was wondering-- maybe you could come with me tomorrow? To your family's Christmas? I don't know. It would tear me up to think that a guy like you didn't make it to a Christmas dinner table. What about your family? They'd love to have you. I have a ton of work to finish by the 26th. I'd have to bring it with me. For sure, you'd have to. Come on, it'll be fun. Plus, my family goes all-out on the food. I never really had a big Christmas celebration before. Well, this year will be special. I'll pick you up in the morning? Sure, why not. Ten-thirty. Ten-thirty. Okay. Merry Christmas. Hey, get in here. Work. Trying to remember from last night-- your brother's names are Andrew and Bart, right? Yep. Dad is Abe, grandma's Ruth. Right. I call her granny. Are you sure I'm not imposing? I told you, they'd love to have you. Andrew, Bart, Abe, granny. Hey, what's your favorite Christmas song? "The 12 days of Christmas." Are you serious'? Me too! Yeah'? Of course! I' we're here. Looks great. I'm home! Daddy! Oh, monkey! Oh, I have missed you so much, honey bug. So good to see you. Sister slim! Barty boy! Cindy darling. Philip. I didn't know you'd be here. Your dad invited me to dinner, just like old times. Welcome home, beautiful. Everyone, this is Michael. I invited him for Christmas dinner. Oh, great. Hello. We'll be glad to have you. Thank you. Cindy, precious, you're just in time for lunch. Who the hell are you? Perfect family, meet Michael briskett. Lunch is ready. You startled me there. I did? Yeah. All looks so good. Cindy, I was just saying that Philip is now my associate professor in the human sciences department. Why don't you stay for new year's this year? We can hit our favorite haunts, paint the town. You and I don't have any old haunts, Philip. We used to date. No, we didn't. These people took me in. I'm a part of the family. Not really. At the least, I'm a good friend. You will always have a seat at our table, Philip. Hey, let's eat! Bon app?tit! Ooh, I love ribs! I' I can't eat another bite. Michael, I hear you're an eggnog man. You bet I am. Well, good. Then, may I propose a toast-- to, uh, home cooking. Merry Christmas, everybody. Merry Christmas. Can I? Uh, sure. I can't say I ever had a real Christmas, but thanks to Cindy and you all, I finally get a chance to celebrate in a way I'd always hoped-- with great people and good food. To the holidays. Nice speech, briskett. Little corny, but I like your sentiment. Bart, good, man, good to see you. Did you leave any food for me? Doubt it. Granny, how are you? Good to see you, Andy. Nice to see you. Andrew, my boy. You know him? Philip. Sis. Glad you could make it. Mr. robillard? Yes. Yes. Yes. Huh? Sister? Mm-hmm. How do you like my family, briskett? They're nice. Help! Help me! Help! Shut the fuck up! Nobody can hear you! Oh, god, oh, god! Jesus god, the pain! Aaahhh! Hey! Screaming like a bitch isn't gonna help. Believe me, I've been trying. What is going on? I don't fucking know. Shh. Be quiet. Oh, Jesus! The pain is killing me! Shh. Shut the fuck up, old man. I'm pissing my pants. Shh! Shut up. Shut up! What is that? What the fuck?! Ban?! Do you know this motherfucker? How do you know his name? Hey! Do you have my medicine? Oh, Jesus, no. Hey, put it down. He's old. Just let him go. ...hurts so bad! No, Bart! Where are you going? No, no, no, no! Oh, my god! Oh, no! Mister, what the fuck are you doing? Oh, shit! Jesus Christ, what just happened? Aah! Mr. robillard? I need you to come with me. No, no, no! Mr. robillard! Mr. robillard. L-i don't understand. Briskett, shut up. We have a bit of a dilemma here. We have Christmas dinner, which you're obviously a part of, and then I still need my breakdowns for my meeting with quantum dynamics in two days. Hey, Andrew, the game is on. All right, pop, in a minute. All righty, then, but hurry-- almost the end of the first half. Where was I? So, you're gonna do those reports for me by Christmas, tomorrow. I mean, shit, briskett, it's what you're good at. Sitting at your desk, focusing on silly little numbers, is your specialty. Yes or no? Look at me. Yes or no? Yeah? Yes? Good. Move up. Get up. Now, I understand that it's a short timeline. Conditions are not ideal. But I have a way to help you focus. So, what do you think? Motivated? It's a beautiful table, huh? What are you, a righty? Lefty? Right)!-. Okay. Now. If you need anything at all, I will be close by. You still have your season tickets, Andrew? Nah. I gave 'em up. Got too busy. This job is a killer. Mnh. Perils of the gilded life, Andy. You know what Oscar wilde once said-- shut up, Philip. Really? Michael, i don't hear any work. Yes. Five for five from the line. I knew that guy could shoot, I'll tell you that right now. Pop, you should come to the city. I'll buy you a nice dinner, we'll get some great seats. How about that? Yeah! All right, let's do it. What's the score? Uh, second quarter, we're up by three. Briskett, i do not have all year! Important work, son? I have a meeting in two days. It's a good chance to take my company to the next level. Ahh. Looking sharp, granny. Turn that TV off. Mother, the game is on. I don't care if Johnny Carson is at the door, it's time to go to church. Couldn't we skip it this year? Put those giblets in the icebox. Granny, come on. Really. Very important stuff going on here. Church doesn't exactly fit in the timeline, okay? Andy, the good lord doesn't give a crap about your timeline. My god, Cindy, it's just a church service. It's the only day i get to dress up, okay? I think you look amazing, darling. Don't call me darling. Well, boys, I think it's official-- two beautiful ladies have decided we won't be watching the game, and frankly, I don't want to fight a losing battle. Granny, is that fur? Yes. Take that off! Granny, the places where they make those coats are slaughterhouses. They're inhumane! My land, i didn't know that. It's horrible. I don't believe it. I could kill somebody. I just set the table not 30 minutes ago. Oh, yeah. That might have been my bad. I nicked my finger peeling apples for granny. Are you okay? I'm fine. Oh, well, no problem. Just a drop. I'll wash the tablecloth after dinner. Hey, listen, we'd better hop on our giddyup if we're gonna make that 4:00 service, I'm telling you right now. Okay, well, I don't think i can make it. And you are going to church! Fuck. Help! Help me! Please, somebody help! Hey, shut the fuck up! You don't think we've been screaming our guts out? Nobody can hear us down here. So, who the fuck are you? My name is Michael. I work in the data assessment department. What am I doing here? Michael, we have to find a way out of here. Now, what do you know? I don't know. I got brought here this morning by Cindy. Who the hell is Cindy? The girl. The-the daughter in the family. You're telling me there's a whole family of these motherfuckers? Of course! How did you get here? This motherfucker clocked me in the head. If I'd have seen him coming, it'd be a different fucking story. They grabbed me in my bar. Just... They killed my friend. So, how many of them are there? None. They all went to church. They went to church?! All right, look, somebody's got to be looking for at least one of us, right? I mean, you got friends that'll miss you and shit, right, tubby? Fuck. You? Doubt it. Damn, nobody? No, no one. You? Of course somebody's looking for me. Ain't nobody looking for me. Ah, fuck! Please, somebody, help! Help! Help! Help us, please! Please help me! Help! Come on! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What the fuck's wrong with you? Can't you see? We are fucked. Bullshit. I ain't a fuckin' animal. Aah! Fuck! How the fuck do we get out of here? Mike! Yes? What's the upstairs like? It's pretty nice. It's all done up for the holidays. I didn't ask for a travel report, bitch. Are there windows? What about doors? If we can make it upstairs, can we get the fuck out of here? Probably, yes. It's just a house. Okay. Cool. Let's get going. How long until church is over? Do you know something i don't know? Because I am chained to the fucking floor. Well, i guess church is over. I hate fucking Christmas. Shit! ."Heinbounds for a pass with four seconds left. A bounce off the glass, two points, but he was fouled, so there was a chance to tie it up at the line and go into overtime. How do you know that? Well, when I used the men's room during the sermon, I snuck out to the car and caught the end of the game. No way! Yeah, I perfected that trick when your mother was still with us. I'm gonna have to steal that. So what happened? He missed it. No, he didn't. Yep. Mom must have known you were watching the games. Probably. But god love your mom, she never said a word. I bet she was a bitch. What did you just say? Oh, shit. You heard me, motherfucker! Fuck you! Fuck both of you! Fuck your little freakshow family! Get your hands off me! Get the fuck off me! He's a live one! Boy, I'll tell you that! Untie me! Untie me, motherfucker! Untie me and fight me like a man! Fight like a man, you pussy! Fuck you! You'd better fucking kill me! You'd better fucking kill me! Ooh! That's quite enough of that chatterbox! So, what are the ladies saying they need this year? They mentioned legs to me a bit earlier, and, uh-- oh! Last Sunday, granny was talking about teaching Cindy her sweet pineapple marinade. Ooh, that'd be great. Yeah. Legs it is. All right! Whoa. Hang on a second. Hang on a second. Here you go. Thanks,pop. Uh-huh. Look, the one thing you have to understand about basketball is the free throw, I mean, the key element for winning games. What about rebounds? Maybe they need a big man. Tough cut. Good bones. Yeah, looked that way. Ow. All right, excuse me just a second. Michael. Why are you doing this to us? Focus, briskett. Take a bite. You do have a gift for numbers. Philip, what are you doing in here? Hey, you need any help with that? I'm working. Can-can you go in the other room? Cindy's trying. She is, she's trying, but... It's not like it used to be, when mom was here. We'd all be in the same room right now, playing charades or some crap. Food'd be done, and... Mom would be walking around with a plate of cookies, and... she'd be laughing, and... - You sure look great. - Don't touch me! You sure you don't want to give it another shot? Don't go anywhere. Oh, my god! I never was, and won't ever be, Philip. You think you could go watch TV or read a magazine or something? I was just trying to help. You're just in my way. Fine. If that's how you want it to be. You know, Ralph Waldo Emerson once said, "for every minute you're angry, you lose 60 seconds of happiness." I could give a shit, Philip. I'll tell you right now, nothing's going to ruin the first Christmas I've put together myself, I'll tell you that right now. Cindy, untie me, please. Let me go. Come on, it's stocking time! Let's not piss on the winds of tradition. Cindy, you can't be like your family. Not you. Not the girl i met last night. I don't believe it. You don't have it in you. See, I'd argue it's all about the glass. Rebounds win games. No, no, you've got to find a perimeter shooter. Get those legs in the kitchen! So behind. I've got to get 'em in the roaster. Dinner's not gonna be ready any time soon. Tell me it's not who you are, Cindy, please. Boys, it's stocking time! Oh, stockings! Great. I'll get the camera. Uh, the fork goes on the right side, next to the spoon. Left side. Thank you. Left side. Andy! Granny and her stockings. Put 'em up, take 'em down. Put 'em up, take 'em down. Family tradition! Henry Ford always said, "the only history that's worth a damn is the traditions you make with your family." You're not even a part of this family, Philip. But it's a beautiful thing to witness the customs of another tribe, so to speak. Tribe? What the hell are you talking about, Philip? I've said it before, but I can't stop saying it again. It is so nice to have you three kids together again under this roof. Christmas is my favorite time of year. Oh, daddy. Now stockings! Cindy, you first. Oh, crap. Give me some scissors. Oh, I got it. Okay. There. I'm really happy that we're all together again. Love you, mom. God rest her. She's up there somewhere, looking down at us right now. I can guarantee that. "Family. "That dear octopus from whose tentacles "we never quite escape, nor, in our innermost hearts, ever quite wish to." What the hell are you talking about? Cindy, have you decided on a dessert yet? Dessert? Ohh! Not good! You gotta start that early, or you'll get behind like you did with them legs. Granny, I'm-I'm trying, okay. There's a lot to do. We should be eating soon, and you haven't even got those legs in the oven yet. All right, granny, please! It's a bad thing to leave a family hungry! I know. Like Nelson said, "food is the fuel that drives a family to--" oh, Philip, goddamn it! Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up, you son of a bitch! I'm sorry I yelled at you, granny... Oh, it's all right, honey. I'm sorry too. You've got a lot on your plate. I have an idea. What about mincemeat pie for dessert tomorrow? That'd be good, right? We can use Philip. - That'd hit the spot. - Yeah. I could try that. Yeah. Yes, of course you can, honey. It'd be wonderful. Listen, Abe, let's finish up these stockings and give Cindy some time to finish her work. All righty, then. What do you think is going on down there? Brisket! Help! I've been kidnapped! My name's Michael briskett! I'm being held prisoner! Help! Help! Hello, officer. You must be Andrew. I recognize you from your picture. You do? Which one? Hi! Hey, baby. You two know each other? Andy, this is Denise, my girlfriend. She'll be having dinner with us tonight. She'll be eating with us? That's what I'm saying. What?! She's a cop. Yeah. I know. Dispatcher, actually. Not really an officer. Andy, I've heard so much about you. Yeah. Can't say the same. Yeah. Get in here. This is Michael. He's Christmas dinner. A beef steak. That's the best cut you'll find on a grown man. Big fat boy like this-- right here. That's the t-bone, tenderloin, and right up here, the ribeye. Come around under the pits. That's the brisket. A family favorite. Gotta keep him alive as long as possible. Brush is best. Doesn't mean we can't tenderize him a little bit. You fucking bastard! Aw, shit! Don't you touch him! That is my man, you bitch! We don't want to ruin the groceries. I'm sorry, baby. Please, please. How's your leg? Mosquito bite. Hey, I need to help pop. You want to watch? No, it's okay. I think I'll just, uh, go up and see if Cindy needs help. Hey. I love you. Love you too. Oh, shit. He's still alive? I'll be damned! Okay, boys. Here's the question: Where do you suppose mincemeat comes from? I'm guessing the shoulder blades. How long have you even been together with this chick? Name's Denise. It's been a couple of months. Ah-ha ha. Says here, "sweet mincemeat pie comes from..." ...uh, behind the haystack, just below the exit. The poop shoot? The colon. That's what it says here. Eh. As long as it tastes good. That's what I've always said. Andy, want to do the honors. Uh-oh. Uh, be back in a second. So... Think Denise is safe? What are you trying to say? Is she gonna keep her mouth shut, about all this? Look, I've never met a girl like her before.She just gets me. Okay, well, perfect reason to expose the family's traditions. Great, Bart. You got a problem with my choices, Andy? I do. I think you're being stupid. She puts everything at risk. She's a fucking cop. Dispatcher. There's a difference. Even better. So she'll call every cop in the city. You better back down, Andy. You didn't even tell me you'd invited her to dinner. I didn't know I needed to. Is it so surprising that I have a girlfriend? I'm talking about you inviting some random stranger over for Christmas dinner without telling anybody. Cindy and pop knew. Maybe if you came around more than once a year, you'd know. Shut up. Shut up. Bite it in the ass. Please stop, please. Please stop. Pop. Save him for granny's rocky mountain oysters. Oh, shoot! You're right. Got a little excited there. So, 400 for how long? Twenty minutes. Then reduce the heat to 325 until the inside is pink. Finish low and slow. That is how you get the crispy skin. Mmm! My favorite part! Mom always said the gravy needed the most time. It takes the longest. Mmm, gotta let the gravy soak up those giblet juices overnight. And you need really mature ingredients. Open the kidneys, let 'em breathe in the sauce. Mom taught me that. Yeah, one hell of a cook, god rest her. Cindy's got the gift too. Well, I am trying. Hey, thanks for your help. It's-it's been nice to have an extra set of hands around the kitchen again. Oh, ladies! Oh , oh! Excuse me. Delicious! Just like your mother's. Is the food ready? We got a ton of work to do. Let's eat. L-- are-are you okay? L-i just wanted to see if you were okay. How's your head? Splitting. Where'd the party go? I guess they're done. For now. How is your shoulder? It really hurts. Listen. Whatever he wants you to finish... Don't give him the satisfaction. Bon app?tit! Denise, you will never leave this family's table hungry. Cindy, that's beautiful. Ooh, doggie. E-everybody bow your heads. Dear lord, we thank you for this bountiful feast that you have provided for us, and we also thank you for bringing our loved ones back home again. And even though some of our beloved can't be with us today, we take great pleasure in knowing that they are up there with you. Amen. Amen. Bart, will you do the honors? You bet I will. Granny, your plate. No! No! Where are your manners? Denise is new to the table. She should go first. Go ahead. Honey, you don't have to if you're not feeling it. Yes, she does! She definitely does! No, she doesn't! If she wants to have Christmas with our family, she does! I love it. Cindy, you have your mother's gift for the kitchen. Well, I just followed her recipe. The flavor is so rich. Oh, thanks. L-i can give you the recipe if you want it. It's not supposed to be like this. Not on Christmas. I hate to break it to you, but Christmas is just a shithole day like any other. No. It's not right. It's not. Christmas is supposed to be about chestnuts, and nutcrackers. It's about cookies and food, and... And snow. I see it every year. And I always wanted to have it. And I never had it. This year I was sure... I was sure that I... It's not supposed to be like this. It's supposed to be about warmth and tradition, and if it's special-- I mean really special-- there'll be a white Christmas. Christmas is dead. That's not true. It's not. It's about family, right? And family is forever. Shut up, you naive son of a bitch. Christmas? Family? This crap. That's what that group of motherfuckers is up there. You know, we need more families with their own special traditions, traditions they Cherish, can't do without. Welcome to the family. And if that's what it is up there, I don't want to be a part. And that's okay with me, you know, because I am alone and i am happy, can't you tell? I've never had anybody looking out for me. No, but, hey, cheer up. Maybe by some lucky chance, you have a friend in your life, someone who is watching your back, loves you like a brother. You got that in your life? No, because, hell, i don't have any friends, and apparently you don't have any close by. So I guess that means we have vip invitations to the holiday dinner, and we're the Turkey. Merry fucking Christmas! Please stop. Hey. Which reindeer had the worst manners? What? ?Rude-mph .? merry Christmas. Now? Hell, I'm just gonna say it. We're getting married. What?! Barty, my boy, I'm so happy for you! You've chosen the right lady, I'll tell you that. Well, I'd like to propose a toast. Bart, I never thought I'd see the day, but it looks like you've found yourself a really great girl. Welcome to our family, Denise. - Cheers, everyone. - Cheers! Gosh, this is so exciting. Hey, let's have a talk. That'd be great. She could destroy hundreds of years of family tradition. Andy, have a seat. I'll stand. Okay, but lower your voice. Let's talk about this. She smells like a pig to me, and if she is not a cop, she is as close as one gets. Look, Andy, i trusted your mother. She had no idea what she was walking into that first Christmas. I still remember her face the first bite. Pop, Bart cannot toss some random chick into the mold and expect her to turn out like mom. I don't think you're understanding me here. The reason your mother turned into the woman that you knew is because she was open to change. Now that girl is ready to embrace our family because she loves Bart. I had an amazing time tonight. Why don't you stay? I gotta be to work really early. Nobody else will come in on Christmas. That's fine. Get up early. But stay tonight. I don't think your brother would like that. Which is more important to you-- your family or your career? Pop, listen to me-- i am not about to let some bitch grow a conscience and decide it's time to protect and serve. Everything I've worked for would be destroyed. Son, I'd like to be a grandpa someday-- see a few tots running around on Christmas morning. This family needs to go on. This family's traditions need to go on. Hope you two will join me in a little celebration. Oh, yeah. Got 'em at a gas station, so I can't vouch for their quality. Andy. Join me? Briskett. You get a little messy with your spelling, but, shit, this is some of your best work. Now, we can do this the hard way or the easy way, your choice. I don't want to finish the job. What? Well, a lot of it is-- don't get brave, briskett. I mean, technically, it's not even my department. I'm in data assessment. A lot of that is analysis response, so I'm not even-- do you think I give a shit?! Finish the fucking job! Stop it, you fucking bastard! I don't think so! You know you're not the best statistical analysis man in the office, right? Fred is. But Fred's not a guy who is willing to go the extra mile. You are. Work is your life. Why are you doing this? One, because my family likes their steaks with heavy marbling. And two, because nobody's gonna know that you're gone Just because there's an extra donut in the break room.! So, let's get some work done. I just want to be the first one to wish you a merry Christmas. All right, I'm early, but you know I'm always in a hurry to get to Christmas morning. I just love it so much. I wish you could see it. This house is alive again, just like the old days. Andy has finally come home again. Thought it would take an army. Boy works too much, but he brought his work with him. Cindy helped with that. Nice to see the two of them working together. Oh, and Bart-- Bart has found love, a girl who suits him so well, they're like two peas in a pod. They remind me of us. I just thought you should hear the good news. Merry Christmas, honey. Christmas! Fuck Christmas! Pam, hello! Merry Christmas! Listen, Matt. Michael. Did you know that there's a company Christmas party? Yeah, I'm... A little swamped. Did you get an invitation? No. Exactly. Neither did I. But I got a great party favor. A pink slip. Isn't that cute? The bastards! I-l don't think that's a good idea. Do you know what's a good idea, Matt? Getting the hell out of this place while you're still alive. No, no. I'm just gonna finish up this work and I'm gonna bring it to Mr. robillard. Screw robillard! He will eat you alive and spit out the bones! Come on. You're alive? Fuck yeah, I'm alive. I'm getting the fuck out of here, and you're coming with me. I don't want to lose my job. What? Fuck yeah, you do. Come on. I'll strangle all those motherfuckers. Come on. My health insurance... Help. Work with me. Come on. 401k. Shut the fuck up. You want to play games? Shut up! Shut up.
