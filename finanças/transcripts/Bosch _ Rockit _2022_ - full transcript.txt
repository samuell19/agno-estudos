Because half the force is looking for him and we need to get to him before they do. I know Bosch. Trust me, he's not going to spill on us. You're fucked, Keith. And if you're fucked, I'm fucked. So best you toddle off and do what needs to be done. Wait, love. You dropped your flipper. - Thank you. - You're welcome. What have you got going on here? Ah... Just built a shelter. - A shelter? - Yeah, shelter. Are you homeless? No, I'm just mucking around, me and my boy. We're on holiday. Oh, yeah. Where from? Down the coast a bit. Thought we check out the big city. It's a pretty good spot here, it's pretty special. So far so good. Hey, you wouldn't happen to know anywhere to stay around here would you? Oh, so you are homeless. If you and your imaginary friend get sick of staying in this makeshift tent, then I'd check out the Sails Motel. It's down the road. Sails Motel. Thanks. What's your name, love? fuckin' hell.

Well the truth is... ...She hasn't been around for a while, so it's a bit of a sensitive issue with the young one. Mmm. Listen as a thank you, I'd be honoured if you would do me the very great honour of having dinner with me and a bottle of wine and such. A bottle of wine and such, gee, what century are you from?

He cannot be trusted, he is a Russian. Listen, mate, your name and birthdate doesn't match up with anyone in our system and these number plates have been flagged. It doesn't match up? There must be a problem in the system, officer. I bought this car off a bloke a couple of days back. Going to need you to step out of the vehicle, sir. Or maybe the papers haven't gone through yet.

No, I'd go back to work and you'd finish out your holiday with her, yeah? Did I do something wrong? Mate, I've got to go and do a bunch of stuff that I don't want to do, OK? Are you mad at me? No. It's just... It's not safe... ...With my spy work. But... ...I want to stay together again, like we used to. I know, mate. It's fair for your mum to see you by herself too. You're just saying that. You're not being fair to me. Hello, it's Lizzie. Hello? Can I help you? Hi. Are you OK? We're leaving to go back home tomorrow. Carl got a job. How far? 126 km. You're my only friend. Ash-ash, I'm the only kid here. And when you go back home, all your old friends are going to be there. You're my best friend.

I get your situation, but you've just got to find a way to get to me. I've got some funds for you too. I've gotta run. Keith, wait. Can you trust him? I grew up with him, taught the grommet how to surf. I've gotta work it out. And how are you gonna do that? I can't keep running. Listen... If something happens to me, call this number. You could take my truck OK? Hi, mate. Like your hair. Hey, I'm heading off for the night, all right? Aren't I going to mums? Change of plans, mate. Deb is going to come and look after you, all right? I've got to see a man about a dog. Is that spy code, dad? Hey, listen, mate... Sometimes in life, things have to get a lot harder before they get easier. But just remember that I love you. I'll always love you, all right? No matter what. See ya. Dad? Yeah, mate? Be careful OK? 10-4, copy that. Hey. Hey, Keith. Do you want some? It's straight off the block. No, mate. Oh, the, ah...

Don't know. Some dickhead. Is everything OK, Rockit? Um... Could you put the chips in a bag for me, please? Yeah, sure, mate. Hey, you want extra chicken salt with that, Rockit? No, I'm good. Might make your balls drop. Thanks, Tukz. - Dad! - We're going to call 000. What the fuck, Dad! You can't call an ambulance. Are you crazy? Rockit, call an ambulance now, OK?

It can be life-threatening if not treated in time. Thankfully, you were able to get him here when you did. Can we see him now? Dad! Hello, mate. He's doing better but he's going to need some sleep with these meds. OK. By the way, Mr Jenkins, it says here we're having trouble processing your Medicare number. Do you have a copy in your wallet? Oh, someone nicked it out of our car at the beach, ma'am. OK. Yeah, sometimes our computer systems play up. Yeah. I recommend letting him sleep. OK. Thank you. OK, let's go. I gotta go.

I enrolled you in the local school. It's supposed to be pretty good and I got you a uniform. That's just here and, um, I don't know, you can get your books from school tomorrow. - Thanks, Mum. - You good? Can I still surf before school? Honey, you can do whatever you want.

Then be his mother for this time in his life. Please. I was his mother for eleven fucking years while you never came home. Here we fucking go. You want to know why I never came home? I think half the town knows why you never came home. - Half the fucking town. - Can we get a pizza? Mate, can you just give us a second, please? It's OK. How many drinks have you had? None. Well, one. This is it. Are you even in a state to look after our son, Lizzy? Don't come here and question me. You know what? It was nice seeing you, Bosch. Someone's waiting in the car for you. Yeah, at least someone will fucking wait. Can't believe I'm fucking here listening to this shit. Get the fuck out of my house. - Fuck you! - Get out of my house! Dad! Dad! Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't leave without saying goodbye! You can't leave without saying goodbye. Easy, mate. It's alright. Come on, eh? You know, I'm sorry, Dad. You don't have to be sorry, mate. You did nothing wrong. Alright? It's not goodbye. I just gotta go get myself better. That's all. I messed it up, I messed it up, I know it. Hey, look at me. Look at me. You saved me, mate. And I think you're the best surfer, chef, secret agent. I think you're the best everything, OK? I don't want you to leave, Dad. I don't want you to leave. I'll be back, mate. Your mum and I, we think you're out of this world. You'll be right. I'll be back. Hey, Mum. He left me. Ah! I can't believe he fucking left me. They're all the same, Rockit. It always ends up the same for me. It's OK, Mum. I love you. Come here. You're so... You're such a beautiful son. I'm so lucky to have you. No. Mum, can you just stop drinking? I'm scared. You're scared? What are you scared of? You're scared of me? You're lucky to have me. I'm all you've got. Do you know why I'm all you've got? 'Cause your father's a criminal. - No, he's not. - Yeah. He's a drug-dealing, lying, cheating, con artist. I mean, fuck. Bosch is going to spend the rest of his life in jail. No, he's not, Mum! You're lying! Dad's a spy! And nobody knows that but me. Is that... Is that what he told you? You have to grow up, Rockit. You grow up! You know what Bosch stands for? Fucking bullshit artist. You're a fucking bullshit artist! He's a fucking spy? You going to that thing this week, right? So good. Ash-Ash! Rockit? What are you doing here? This is where my mum lives. Whoa. What are you doing right now? Nothing. Come with me. Why did the gecko cross the road? I don't know. Why? So he could go visit his flatmate. A thing that's run over, it's not flat. He's been run over by a car. So, he'd be flat. He be squished flat, yeah? He wouldn't be in a ball. - No. - Yes. So, where's your dad now? I don't know. Haven't heard from him. I'm sorry. How's it with your mum? I've thought about you a lot. Mum's... I don't know. She's changed. She's always drunk. Why? What do you mean? I guess... She just wants to be loved by someone. She thinks no one ever will. You love her. I try my hardest. I'm really happy you found me. Me too. I told you I'm not hungry right now. Just put it in the oven and I'll have it later. There you go, boys. You fucking dog. Guess what? What? My parents are going away for the weekend, so I'm gonna have the house to myself, and I was wondering if you wanted to have a sleepover? Duh! Only under one condition. What's that? If you promise Carl won't come home halfway through the night. That would suck. Actually, he's going to a wedding, so I can definitely promise that. I can't wait to meet you either. OK. Mum. OK, bye. Bye. What? What's all this? Um... Well, we're visiting Uncle Buck this weekend. Who? Your uncle. We're paying him a visit. Since when are we going to do that? I just thought it'd be nice to spend the weekend with family. Were you even going to ask me? I'm your mum. I don't have to ask. Yeah, but I've got plans with Ashley tomorrow night. - I'm not coming. - Tough shit, mate. You're not even here half the fucking time. What does it matter to you? Well, it matters to me 'cause this is my house and you'll go where I tell you to go. Can you just stop being a fucking brat? I will when you stop being a fucking bitch! Get off the internet, Ash! Fuck! How much further? We're almost there. You hungry? Should we pull in and get some fresh prawns? I don't even like prawns. Well, I do. I reckon it'd be nice to bring for your uncle. How big are your prawns? How much are they? Thank you. Look at them! Here you go. Well, it's here. I think. Uncle Buck lives in a shitter. Jesus. Are you fucking kidding? Um... Right, I'm just going to pop down to the bottle-o. I'll be back real soon. You alright, Mum? Yeah. Rocky. What the fuck is this? Rocky! Hey, Rocky! You hungry? Making some stew. I don't want your fucking stew. "Dear Bosch... I can't take care of Rockit anymore. Here's 200 bucks. It's the best I can do. Your mum, mate, she's a fucking piece of work. I'm sorry. Lizzy." You guys are a joke. All you do is care about your fucking selves! Mum told me what happened! She told me everything! Is that why didn't come back? Hiding from the cops? - I couldn't come back. - Why, Dad? I could barely look after myself, mate. You didn't even bother calling me either, you've fucking loser! - I did. - No, you fucking didn't! Not once! Not once in the whole fucking year! Mum told me you're going to jail for the rest of your life if you don't leave the country. Did you want to tell me that part? Or is that all part of your new plan to take care of me? Rip me out of school again and fuck my whole world up again! You were younger then, mate. Well, I'm not too young to understand that you told me were going on a holiday! But really we were never going back! Or what about the time you told me you were a spy? You're nothing but a crook, Dad, and a liar! Do you know how that feels? Do you? To be left and to be lied to again and again? Do you? There's nothing I can say that can make it better, buddy. I tried to be a good dad. But I fucked it up. Hello? Yeah? I want to apply for the job. Have you got any hair under your arms? Come back when you've got some experience. I've got hairs. I've got tons of experience. Spent my whole life out there. You're going to be way too green. How old are you anyway? Old enough to get laid. Just give me a chance. Don't spend it all at once. I won't. We're going back out at three. Dad? Wake up. I'm up. Made you some lunch. Thanks, mate. How's work going? It's tough. You liking it? Yeah. Caught some massive fish, ton of prawns. Even saw some big sharks circling the boat last night. Makes you not want to surf again. You've surfed with plenty of sharks before. They're sneaky little bastards. Never really see 'em, you know? Want some of this? So, how are you feeling? I'm alright, mate. Whatever happened to Deb? I blew it, mate. I'm surprised she hung around as long as she did. Thanks for cooking lunch. I only made lunch 'cause I couldn't bear another day of your fucking stew. Fuck, me neither. I love you, Dad. I love you, too, buddy. Dad! Here's the boat going to Fiji, Dad. Hey, mate. Hey... I want you to promise me that you'll never stop surfing. Why would I? You know, your mum and I, we... We did love each other. For a while. Her, so young, mate. You know, we weren't ready. I definitely wasn't ready. Should've done things a lot differently. I made a lot of mistakes, mate. But you were the best thing that ever happened to me. You know we'll meet again, yeah, Rocky? Just keep your eyes open for a postcard from Rodney Jenkins. Hey, mate. I've got to go see a man about a dog. Oh, my god! Rockit! I made these for you. You're out of this world. I'm in love with you, Rockit. I love you, too, Ash-Ash. Are you really going to go? I have to work. Stay with me. Finish school. We could find a way to make it work. Remember when we were younger and we were trying to catch a shooting star? I was scared. And I asked you to stay there until we caught one. It was you.
