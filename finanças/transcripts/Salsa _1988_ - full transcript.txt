A family convention? You brought your little sister? Rita, what are you doing here? Come on! I just came to look. You know, I've told you a million times, I don't want you here. You know it's not right! You listening to me? Rita, what do you want to drink? This is my brother Rico. Rico, this is Lola, my new friend from school. She drives. It's a pleasure. - You drive? - Yeah. Will you drive my sister home then? You guys have school tomorrow. I always wanted a big brother. - Hi. - Hi. Margarita, I hardly recognized you, all dressed up. Thanks, now try to convince my brother to let me stay for one dance. Nobody's going to convince me to do anything. Just go home. - Bye, Ken. - Good night, Margarita. Good night. Señoras y señores, presenting the Queen of Salsa... La Luna! And now, ladies and gentlemen... a very special guest, and my friend... the First Lady of Song... La Reina De La Salsa, Celia Cruz... and the great Willie Colon! There's that boy Rico I was telling you about. - Talk about charisma. - Yeah, Celia likes him. Who doesn't? - Leave him. - I don't want anyone jumping on stage. He's not just anyone. Sit down! Yeah, Rico, go! Hey, Mom. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. It's okay. You want something to eat? No, thanks. Is Rita home? Yes. Try not to be so hard on her. She needs your love. Since your father died, it's been... Mom, I love her. I just worry. I don't want her hanging out at the club. So, did you and Vicki clear the floor? We danced. I'm tired. Good night. Good night, mi hijo. Man, I'm drenched. Yeah, my dad always said, "Don't sweat, unless you're getting paid for it." Are you thinking about him? - Who? - Ken. What do you mean? I saw how you were looking at him. No, Ken is just like a brother to me. Well, he's not your brother... and he doesn't look at you like a brother, that's for sure. He doesn't? Does Rico have a girlfriend? Yeah, sort of. Vicki. Wait a minute. I hope you don't have any plans. Rico's too old for you. Are you kidding? I've had older than him before. You're so crazy. I thought you knew me better than that. Well, yeah, I know my brother. Rico only likes two things, Rico and salsa. We'll see. - Kenneth. Just on time. - Why, what's up? I need a little favor. - Another favor, man? - Yeah. I want you to keep Rita busy while I make a move on her friend. - Who? - Lola. - She's just a baby, man. - And I'm a baby sitter. - I don't like it. - Come on. Poquito, man, it's easy. You know that rock singer I told you about? He's going to be really famous someday. Hi, you remember Lola? Rita, I thought I told you not to mess with my stereo? - This is Ken. - Hi. So, getting some color? - Trying to. - Yeah? Rita, why don't you make us some drinks? - All of us. - I'll get some iced tea. Ken, why don't you give Rita a hand? Yeah, sure. Hi, Lola. Hi. So, I bought something for Rico. - What is it? - It's a belt. I got it for his birthday. It's great. - It's real leather. You think he'll like it? - Yeah, he'll love it. Maybe I should get him a record or something. This belt's great. I'd even borrow it. - Yeah? - Yeah. I don't know. Should I give it to him now, or wait until the party? You should wait till the party. Don't tell him there'll be more friends there. - Really? - What's wrong with this buckle? There's nothing wrong with it. See? Do you want me to wrap it for you? Yeah, nothing too fancy. Do you want it in a box? A ribbon? What? The belt. Oh, yeah. Great apartment. Where's your bed? Cool system!

Good, good, good loving Ladies and gentlemen, Club Luna is proud to present... from Puerto Rico, the great Tito Puente! Just a reminder that next week, right here... we salute El Festival de San Juan. And just to make the evening more exciting, Club La Luna will send anyone... who can clear the floor to the Grand Salsa Competition... in San Juan, Puerto Rico. That kid's fantastic. I love the way he handles her on the floor. He makes her look good. She doesn't have any talent, reminds me of a horse. What are you saying? That he would make a great partner for a woman who knows what she's doing. Meaning you? I have been known to clear a dance floor in my day. That's right. You cleared the dance floor. No one even looked at your partner. You still need one, darling. What are you telling me? Are you saying you want to dance again? Or that you want to go to Puerto Rico? Or that you want to sleep with this kid? That's what I love about you, darling. You fill my head with so many wonderful ideas. Bring him to my table. Anything for you. You bring wonderful energy to my club. Thanks. Coming from you, it's a compliment. You're terrific. But your partner, she's not a dancer, she's going to need some work. We're going to work hard. You're welcome to use my club during the day to rehearse, if you like. Thanks, we're gonna need it. We're going to Puerto Rico. The flight doesn't leave for a few days. Stay and have some champagne with us. I think I might have to take a rain check. Thanks. Champagne? - Hi, Rico. - Hey, Lola. I'm alone, and you're alone. So what do you say we get together and finish where we left off? What we started was a mistake. It was my mistake. Besides, I'm not alone. You're not serious about that girl you were dancing with, are you? Yeah, I'm very serious, and I don't want any problems. Comprende? Are we going? Yeah. Vicki, this is Lola. This is Rita's new friend. She's just about to take Rita home. - Hi. - Hi. Listen, tell Rita to tell Mom I'm over at Vicki's tonight, okay? Bye. - Hi. - Hi. Do you have a ride home? I don't think so. I'll take you home. - Yeah, okay. - Okay. - How're you doing back there? - What? - How're you doing? - I'm fine. Do you need anything? - How about ice cream? - What? - Ice cream! - Okay. - Anything on it? - No. - Sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Can I have a vanilla and a chocolate? - Thanks for the ride. - I had a great time. - Really. - Yeah, I liked it mucho. What? - I liked it mucho. - It's "mucho gusto." Well... - Good night, Margarita. - Good night. Come on. I'll make you something to eat. You're so beautiful. I'm really happy we're back together. I missed you so much. I've missed this place... and the mutt. What's wrong? You're shivering. After tonight... I'm afraid. The stakes are too high, and... You could go to Puerto Rico. I don't want to get in the way of your dreams. Vicki, you are my dream. Can't you... Haven't you noticed how people look at us when we dance together? They're looking at you. No, Vicki, they're looking at you. I mean... relax, we'll go to Puerto Rico. Positive. How could you be so sure? Well, if I told you, you would probably laugh. No, I won't. Yes, you would. No, I won't. It's important. Well, when I was a little kid, my Dad would always say: "Rico, I'm going to take you to Puerto Rico." You know, he'd show me pictures... he'd talk about it... and then he died. But right now, I feel like he's so close, he's with us. He's hugging us. He's happy we're together again, he's happy for the family. He says we're going to clear that floor... and we're going to Puerto Rico. What else does he say? What? About us. The future, kids. Gee, let me give him a call. I don't know. He says, we'll have two... No, maybe we'll have five. Five kids. They're all going to dance. They're all going to dance. They'll go on tour, make lots of money, make a lot of people happy. And then we'll retire in Puerto Rico. - You have a one-track mind. - No. It's almost time. I'll go inside, and I'll get something to celebrate with. - Okay. - Okay. Each night, I pray there would soon come a day That I'd find my way back to your shore Somehow I knew, if I reach you It's there that my heart will stay Forever more High on the dream I'm still believing Say you'll be mine My Puerto Rico How can it be that your heart beats in me? I keep hearing your song in my mind How did I know It was Puerto Rico that's been calling me All of the time? I close my eyes, I am in paradise Say you'll be there My Puerto Rico Hold me tonight, under the stars Puerto Rico Where I belong, there in your arms Puerto Rico Every beat, I feel the heat Puerto Rico Every step, closer I get Puerto Rico I'm coming home to you Rico? Vicki! Welcome to Puerto Rico! Silencio everybody! Rico's here! Please, everybody. - Go on, girls. - Told you. - Well, let's go back to your place. - No. Come on, then tell me what we're doing. Chuey's around here. - No, he's not. - Yes, he is. - Aunt Rosie's here, she's cooking. - No. Where are we? At home? Tell me where we're at. Come on. Please? - Come on. - Happy birthday, mi hijo. Surprise! Yo, Rico! Happy birthday, man. Can you move in a little bit? Here we go. Puerto Rico. I love you, Ma. - Listen to me! I told you no. You're drunk! - I'm not drunk. I'm happy. Vicki, I didn't do anything. Wherever Rico is, you are never far off... like a faithful dog. Lay off, Lola. You're drunk. But everybody knows he doesn't care about you anymore. Lola, don't cause a scene. This is Rico's party. He deserves a good time. I already showed him the good time. Didn't he tell you? This is better than Miami Vice! - Vicki, what's wrong? - Time you opened your birthday presents. - Lola. Come on, honey. Come on. - Is she okay? - Yeah, Mom, she'll be okay. - She just had a bit too much to drink. - Take her to the house, Rico. - Give her some air! There's nothing wrong! There's plenty of food! Let's go! - Who turned off the music? - Bang those drums! - Where are we going? - Just calm down. You'll be okay. - Come on. - Oh, yeah. Come on, stop it, okay? There's a house full of people. I can't help it. You excite me. Come on, Lola! I just came in here to help you. Here, I'll show you how you can help me. Get off me, Lola. I said stop, Lola. Come on, Rico, let's do it. Is she in there? - Who? - Lola. - No. - No? No. Guess what? Your mom asked me to go get some beer. - Want to come with me? - Now? - Yeah, now. - Okay. Come on. Please? Come on, Ken, let's just give them one beer. Happy New Year! Happy birthday. Hey, fellas, take your hands off the girl right now. All right, take it easy, fellas. - Margarita. - Margarita! Margarita Margarita Come on, please? - Come on. - Come on. Hey, where are you going? And our love goes on forever When I'm with you, I'm not well Margarita I will search until I find you And the roses will remind me And I will wake inside the dream The sun in her hair The tropical air The smell of the sea The girl next to me She's got the touch That I need oh so much My muchachita It's more than her eyes More than her voice More than her smile That leaves you no choice Straight from the pages of love she was born Margarita And if I could get back to that dream I know she'll be there Waiting for me Margarita I will search until I find you And the roses will remind you I will wake inside the dream What? Come on, fellas, we have to go. I gave you all my beer. This is how you're going to treat me? She's a young girl. We have... Margarita Beautiful! Mind if I interrupt with some constructive criticism? - Of course not. - It's the crossover step. I've seen that danced a thousand times like that. - I can show you a much better way. - Sure. Cross over. And again. Second position. - I don't understand. - Open your legs. Deeper. Now hold me strong. And stand tall. - All right. - Open break! Now that's the way that step should be danced! - Want to see some more? - Sure. I understand you like to travel. - I sure do. - Then let's go. Imagine how he feels. He's dancing with the best. - You care a lot about him, don't you? - Yeah. Well, I love her. I would do anything for her. So, what are you trying to say? Why don't you get to the point? What I'm trying to say... is that if you love someone, you don't stand in their way. Luna wants to dance again. And Rico's her perfect partner. Let him go. Whatever it takes, just let him go. - Where are you going? - I'm going home. What do you mean? We have to rehearse. No, you have to rehearse, not me. Vicki, what's wrong? Dancing with you is wrong. Being with you is wrong. Now you have a new partner, the Queen of Salsa. She was just showing us a few steps. A few steps? You were swept away. I saw you. I was left there, standing like a jerk. Come on, Vicki. No, but it's okay. She's a fucking better dancer than me anyway. Yeah, but I love you. No, you don't. You love your dreams. And she is your ticket to Puerto Rico, not me. - You know, you're never home anymore. - Jealous? Listen, I want you home, in bed, by 10:00 on school nights. - Who died and made you king? - What? - Don't tell me what to do. - Don't talk back, and don't test me. Just do what I said. Yes, Your Majesty. - What's going on here? - Nothing. - Is this going to become a regular routine? - Yes. I'm buying it. - I want a popcorn. - Don't put any butter, unless it's free. - Hey, Rita. - God, you scared me. Know what time it is? - I was with a friend, her car broke down. - I don't believe that. Rico, why don't you get off my back? Did your slut friend introduce you to someone? You should know about my slut friend. Since you been hanging around Lola, you been turning into some kind of puta! Don't call me puta, cabron. Hey, stop it! Both of you. - God, I hate you. - Yeah? You're grounded. I don't know you anymore. My son would never hit his sister. My boy would never strike a woman. If you sneer, you're not acting like my son anymore. You're acting like some big, punk, macho shit. I won't ask you where you've been, because I trust you. But you should have called. Yeah, Mom. Baby, remember... with my job, we eat and pay the rent. It was your brother who, on his own, took that job at the garage, fixing cars... so that we could all live better. So, when he gets upset with you, you must be more patient. He loves you. He's growing up so fast... but, in so many ways, he's just a little boy. Try to understand, Margarita... the way I understand about you and Ken. It's okay. I want to talk to you about something. I want to talk to you, too. You first. It's Rita, man. What about her? I'm worried, you know? Is she okay? She's been coming home late, she's not doing well in school. She doesn't eat right. It's just a lot of shit, you know? Maybe she's just growing up. No, I think it's Lola. I'll bet you anything she set her up with someone. Maybe he's a nice guy. Well, maybe we should go and find out who this nice guy is. - Why? - So we can kick his ass. We've got to take care of our kid sister. You're going to help out, right? I mean, we are familia, bro. - So, what were you going to say? - Nothing. What are you doing? - I'm doing my best... - I don't like it when you do that. - My best? - No, the knee drop. It's amateurish. I figured, if you were spinning, I'd, you know, solo. Solo? To me, that's not the salsa. To me, what you do isn't salsa, either. I don't have time for this. Just follow my skirt, little boy. We need a little reality check here. This is not The Rico Show. You are the frame, and I am the picture, got it? Now, let's dance. You're taking things too personally, Rico. Sorry. You think you're going to get to Puerto Rico dancing like that? If I do this once, on my own, it'll be okay. You make me feel insecure. I just have to work on it. San Juan is 4,000 miles away. You've got 3,800 more to go. Orlando. Don't worry about it. She likes you. Rita. Hi. I don't want to keep this a secret anymore. I tried to tell Rico... but it'll kill him. I love the both of you. I love my brother, but he can't come between us. It'll be fine, Margarita. Don't worry. - We weren't doing anything. - Just shut up, and get in the house. It's not her fault. Go ahead, go in. - Don't touch my sister. - I love her. You love her ass! That's not it, bro. Don't call me "bro," man. It's been you all this time. You dumb Puerto Rican. You just don't get it. Don't! You're going to kill him! Stop! Please, stop, don't. He didn't do anything! Please! Stop! Don't, please. Don't, you're going to kill him! We didn't do anything. Stop, please! Why don't you let him go? I worked my ass off to make a better future for Rita... and she's throwing it away because of you, you piece of shit! What is she throwing away, man? Man, you betrayed us. La familia. We took you in when you had no one. What are you saying? You know what I'm saying? If I ever catch you here around my sister, I'm going to kill you, man. - Come on. - No, let me go! Come on. See you tomorrow. Bye. Hi. God, you look so awful. We have to talk. About what? It's got to end. What do you mean? I mean, the both of us. It's not right between us. Look, Rita, you have to go to school and be someone. I am someone, someone I thought you cared about. If I didn't care, I wouldn't be here saying this. I wish things could be the way they were. I love you. What the hell's going on with you? - I'd never drop you. - I wish you would drop me... if it meant that you'd get your move right for once. Maybe we'd get something more exciting going on here... something more dynamic. Damn it. Listen, I'm sorry. I can't concentrate. - I've got a lot of things on my mind. - I don't care about your personal problems. Your problems don't belong on my dance floor. This is my last night to rehearse. The festival is tomorrow, and it's your ass on the line, baby. No, it's your ass on the line, okay? Because this is your last chance to be the Queen of Salsa. Just who the hell do you think you're talking to? I earned every bit of that title, and I earned every square inch of this club... and nobody gave it to me, I had to work for it. I don't understand you. I'm giving you the world on a platter, you little shit. I thought your girlfriend didn't know how to dance, but I was wrong. It's you. No timing, no concentration. What is it with you? You just don't care? If I have to back-lead you all over this dance floor... I promise you, I am going to make an impression. I am going to clear that dance floor, even if it's with your ass. Now, you got that? Yeah? - It's nothing, Ma. - Something's wrong. I want to know. Ma, there's nothing wrong. I just want to be alone. Please. - Are you sure? - Yeah, Mom, I'm sure. Are you nervous about the dance tomorrow night? Good night. You better be careful. Your brother is already here. - What brother? - Very funny. I'm serious. He sees you dressed like that, he'll go crazy. Crazy? Good. This is a night he's never going to forget. - Come on. Let's dance. - I am scared of you. Girls Say what they wanna say Boys Look at them anyway Girls They're always acting shy Boys You know the reason why Girls They like to play with you Boys They like to party, too Some girls do, some girls don't Some girls will Go all the way Some girls will, some girls won't Some girls don't Dance the night away Party every day Why is he dancing like that? He'll wear himself out. Relax. I can't. He's supposed to be saving that stuff for me. Don't worry about it. He's warming himself up for you. Boys They think they are macho men Girls Well, they don't give a damn for Boys They seem to care But girls In sexy underwear Boys Are always in demand Girls Will never understand why Boys Don't want to take a chance with Girls Who only wanna dance Some girls do, some girls don't Some girls will Go all the way Some girls will and some girls won't Some girls don't Dance the night away Party every day Some girls do, some girls don't Some girls will Go all the way Some girls will and some girls won't Some girls don't What are you doing here? Are you jealous they'll be looking at me instead of you? Besides, I came to watch you lose. Quit acting like a cheap whore, okay? Is that what you want? I'll act like a whore. You're embarrassing me in front of my friends. Friends? Where's Vicki? Where's Kenny? It's always Rico. This is the last time I'll tell you. Are you going to hit me, like you hit Ken? He never loved you. I told him to baby-sit you. - Where the hell is he going? Stop him. - Let him cool off. He'll be back. How is she, Rico? Just get out of here. - I said, how is she, man? - Mind your own business. You know this is all your fault, right? You know, just get out of here. Leave my family alone! She's going to be all right. She's a little shaken, some light contusions, but she's one lucky girl. - Are you Ken? She keeps asking for Ken. - That's me. - Rico, wait a second. - Just go to hell, okay? Hi. How do you feel? Okay. I'm so happy to see you. I missed you so much. I missed you, too. - Where's Rico? - Rico? He's gone. Gone where? I don't know. He took off. I tried to stop him. This is all my fault. This is because of me. No, it's not. Rico has a lot of problems. I hope he went to the club. I don't think so. He was pretty crazy. Rico has to go to the club. He has to dance tonight. I know my brother. He's going to do something crazy. You have to find him. Please? I think I might know where he is. Let's get out of here. Remember when we got these? We were just kids. Summer vacation. You wanted to be blood brothers, but I was afraid of blood. So I bought us these St. Christopher medals instead. Who'd ever think, after all these years, we'd still be wearing them? You know, even when you ripped this off my neck... you didn't rip it out of me, bro. I know you don't think of me like that anymore. But you're my bro. You're the only family I ever had. I know I hurt you, man... and I'm sorry. Just know, I'd do anything for the familia. Just know, I love you, man. I'll get you another one. What? I'll get you another chain, man. A strong one. I'll be over there. Great timing, you asshole. Time this. Shall we salsa? Each night I pray There would soon come a day That I'd find my way back to your shore Somehow I knew if I reached you it's there that my heart will stay Forever more High on the dream I'm still believing Say you'll be mine My Puerto Rico Hold me tonight under the stars Puerto Rico Where I belong, there in your arms Puerto Rico I missed you. Now I know Puerto Rico has been calling me I close my eyes, I am in paradise Say you'll be there My Puerto Rico Hold me tonight under the stars Puerto Rico Where I belong, there in your arms Puerto Rico Every step, closer I get Puerto Rico I'm coming home to you
