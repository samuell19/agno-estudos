[ROARS] JOHN: No. No. Can't anyone help me? Help. Help. No. [MOANS] [MOANS] [MOANS] Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. You were yelling in your sleep again. The same dream? Try and go back to sleep. VOCALIST: Take me away and teach me to fly. To never die. We'll go away from the shadow. We'll fly into the light. Sweet light. Take me away from the darkness and teach me to sing. Angel of joy catching the light. Angel of fear, drawn to the night. Take me to some place I dream of, where nothing is wrong. Where I belong. You see I have to. I want to go home. Go home. Johnny? Look at this. What've you got? I don't know. It's a cactus gourd. Oh. Huh. What is it? Don't you hear that? CATHY: What? Johnny? JOHN: Shh, shh. Well, what is it? I don't know I hear something, but I-- that's strange. Johnny. Oh! CATHY: It's horrible! Johnny, come on, let's get out of here. Johnny. Johnny! I'm sorry, Cathy. I keep forgetting they turn everybody else off. God, it's ugly. I'll get rid of it. We can get going. Johnny, can't we skip the caves for today and go right on to the slopes? Well I'd kind of like to make the last tour, Cathy, if we can. Is it so important? No, of course not. It's just my work. That's what the weekend's all about, remember? I remember something else. This weekend is also supposed to be an overdue honeymoon. You're right. I can do it later. Come on. Oh Johnny, you're right. Your work is important. We'll catch the last tour. Are you sure? Yes. Absolutely? Come on. While we're in a cave, please stay together. No straggling. No wandering off. Remember there are hundreds of unexplored passageways in the cavern. Water dripped from the ceiling for a long period of time. Each droplet of water that falls from the ceiling leaves a little tiny bit of mineral left behind. It goes downward, forms a long, thin-walled hollow tube. Geologists call a [INAUDIBLE]. CATHY: Oh, wow! You OK? Fine. Hey, see how they're going up the stairs and around there? Come on. Huh? What? Nobody can see us! Doing what? Something down here makes me feel primitive. You haven't got the nerve. Try me. You're on, lady. [SCREAMS] Oh no! [COUGHS] Cathy! Cathy! Cathy! Johnny, please hurry! Cathy! Are you all right? Yes. They're crawling all over me. They're mites, honey. Just keep them off your skin. How do we get out of here? I don't know. The best thing we can do is wait. Sooner or later they'll figure we're missing. They'll send somebody for us. Johnny. Johnny, please, let's get out of here. Cathy. Cathy. No. The best thing we can do is stay put. I'm sorry. Don't be silly. Our honeymoon was getting a little dull anyway. What is it? Same thing I heard before. The bats! I don't hear anything. Quiet. One of them is getting closer. [SCREAMS] Get it out! Get it out! Get it out! [SCREAMS] Are you hurt? It's nothing, Cathy. It's nothing. Are you sure? Are you sure you're all right? Listen. MAN: Hey! Oh god, no! MAN: Hey! Is anybody down there? Hey! Hey, down here! Oh help us, please! Down here! MAN: Are you all right? Yes! MAN: OK. Relax. We'll have you out in no time. JOHN: Cathy, don't do-- Why? Never mind. It doesn't matter. Tell me. You wanted to examine it for rabies. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh! Don't worry about it. CATHY: Stupid. Why did I kick it away? Yep, we could have had some good stew, you know? CATHY: Yuck. [LAUGHS] It tastes just like white meat of tuna. That's what they tell me. You're disgusting. Have you ever thought about what we look like to a bat? I don't care about bats. I care about you. And I care about you-- and bats. JOHN: Look at that. Isn't it beautiful? CATHY: Yeah. Oh, what a run that's going to be. Magnificent! I'm so glad. I'm really happy. [SQUEAKING] [FLAPPING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] CATHY: Johnny, please. Are you all right? [CHUCKLES] What's wrong? I don't know. You-- you were acting so funny. Kind of crazy. Honey, what are you talking about? Honey. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. Whoo! [LAUGHS] What's that? Are you ready for this? Let's go! Geronimo! JOHN: Ya-hoo! [LAUGHING] CATHY: Oh. [LAUGHS] He's really brave. Oh, god. [LAUGHS] Pace yourself. We're next. Oh, no. I'm barely thawed out from the slopes. Ooh. $23 a day. It's almost worth it. You ready for a drink? Oh, am I. I love you. To us, Johnny. [CHOKES] Johnny! Leave me alone! Your hand! Johnny. Johnny, what's the matter with you? You've got to see a doctor. What for? Your hand. It was an accident. I don't care what it was. Please, come on. It's not serious. Not serious? All right. I'll stop in the First Aid Station, first thing in the morning. That looks pretty good. That's not bad. Oh. What are we going to do about that? That can wait. You're the doctor. But promise me something. Start treatment just as soon as you get back, huh? You mean the pasteur treatment? Mm-hmm. Look you two, there's a minimum 30-day incubation period, so there's no reason to spoil the weekend. Is it true that the cure is sometimes worse than the disease? Nothing is worse than rabies. Thanks a lot, doctor. Johnny, I think-- Cath, honey, it's not that big a deal. It can wait till next week. I don't think a week will make any difference. I am going skiing. Oh, don't let anything stop you, doctor. He's only a patient. JOHN: Take it easy, Cath. CATHY: And you're being as irresponsible as he is. You're working on a grant in preventive medicine and you won't take it yourself! You're not doctors, you're children. You ready to go, doctor? I'm ready, doctor. Where are we going? Hospital. About five miles down the hill, in town. Are you happy now? Yes. You prefer this to another day on the slopes, do you? Mm-hmm. Don't worry about it. It's strictly routine procedure. Maybe. You're strictly special, and I don't want anything to happen to you. Cath, nothing's happening. Oh. Mrs. Beck, I can only handle one emergency a day. Would you mind waiting in the solarium? Go ahead, Cathy, it'll only take a minute. OK. Oh, no. 19 to go. What is it? What's happening? I'm burning up. Oxygen. Burning. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? You're having an allergic reaction. Try to breathe slowly. [COUGHS] Sodium phenobarb. Hurry, hurry. I think he's all right now. Prepare a room for Dr. Beck. He'll be staying here, nurse. Yes, doctor. It's a hell of a ride. No, a reaction. Never seen anything like that before. Is that rabies? Well, from what I understand, allergic reactions can produce identical symptoms. It's ironic, isn't it? The odds are probably one in a million. And where's it hit? A researcher. Terrific. [CHUCKLES] I guess the bats are getting even. Yeah. What's your opinion about the rest of the shots? Do you mean, do I think you're going to have another reaction like this? I doubt it. I think that was just the initial jolt. The rest of the shots should have minimal effect. Good. Dr. Kipling! Dr. Kipling! Dr. Kipling, I'm sorry to bother you. You promise not to bawl me out anymore? OK. You know, you were right? I am kind of a ski bum. Doctor, one of the nurses told me what happened. You shouldn't have done that. How serious is it? You mean his reaction to the serum? I wouldn't call it serious at all. But is that it? Huh? Is it possible there may be other side effects? Yes, there is a possibility of side effects, but I wouldn't worry about it. But it was a violent reaction, wasn't it? Yes, it was. Obviously, he is allergic to the serum, but that's not unusual in itself. Pasteur treatment can produce reactions very, very similar to rabies. Like sudden shifts in mood, manic depression, paranoia, inability to swallow-- But that's what I don't understand, doctor. He had those reactions, everything you're describing, before he took the serum. I don't know what you mean. It was really strange. On the gondola and in the jacuzzi, he had these sudden fits of anger. He was completely without any problems one minute, and then in the next he was like a madman, completely out of control, and he wasn't even aware of it. Mrs. Beck, I want to assure you of one thing. Whatever you saw in him, believe me, it wasn't rabies. The incubation period is one to five months. Doctor, what if he does have rabies? I wouldn't worry about it. We got an early start on the treatment. Even if it's not fatal, there's a good chance of brain damage, isn't there? Come on, let's go. [SQUEAKING] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [LAUGHS] Listen, you hypochondriac. I know why you're dating me. Free medical samples. [LAUGHS] [THUMP] Who is that? What do you want? [GLASS SHATTERS] Is this your ring? ANNOUNCEMENT: All student nurses, please report to the auditorium. Lecture about to begin. A lot of excitement this morning. What happened? It's nothing for you to be concerned about. Nurse, I'm a doctor. I am concerned. Right know you are a patient, doctor. Something happened. What was it? It was an accident. What kind of accident? ANNOUNCEMENT: Final call, all student nurses come to the-- The night nurse, she-- fell. How bad? She's-- Good morning, darling. How did you ever get that off? It took two strong men and a boar to get it on. Cathy, I want you to find a psychiatrist. Why? For once in your life, just do what the hell I ask. Can't you see I'm in trouble? But the doctor says you're doing fine. Find somebody, Cathy, now. Of course, darling, I will-- just as soon as I get you settled. What are you talking about? In the motel. They won't let me leave, Cathy. Didn't you talk to the doctor? He says you don't have to stay here. I've already signed you out. I think I should stay close to the hospital, for a while, anyway. But there's no reason! I want to. Isn't that reason enough? OK. ANNOUNCEMENT: Doctor Clark, report for surgery. Doctor Clark, to surgery. OK. No. It's not OK. I'm coming home with you. You don't have to. Yes, I do. Why don't you go on ahead, and find us something for a nice, quiet dinner. You do feel well enough? And forget the psychiatrist. It's fine. How much is that? $20. Thank you. Gift wrap them, please. Glad to. You all right, doctor? Sargent Ward, sheriff's department. How you feeling, Dr. Beck? I'm fine. How did you know my name? I've been following you, doc. Just missed you at the hospital. You're sure you're all right now? Look, Sergeant. I'm taking a series of preventive shots. I don't need to stay at the hospital, and you are not a doctor. So just what can I do for you? Hey, take it easy, doc. All I want to do is talk a little. Now if I had a pretty young wife like yours, and I brought something home like this? There's no telling what she might think, you know what I mean? Well, when I guess you get around to it, Sergeant, you'll know where to find me. Oh, doc? What I wanted to mention is, I'm checking out the accident at the hospital. Last night? I don't know. I can't help you. Well you see, your room's pretty close to where it happened. Thought you might have heard something. Know what I mean? Not a thing. I was asleep. Yeah, I figures, what with all you've been through. Reason I ask is, I found this near the body. It's yours. I don't understand how it got there. Yeah, that's what I keep wondering too. Same way I keep wondering how it got off, you know what I mean? I don't know. Try it. Real puzzler, ain't it? [MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] Do yuo feel all right? Guess so. I think I got flipped oregano again. DISPATCHER: All cars to the vicinity of Blaire High School. Janitor reports group of vandals rampaging through the school. Relay 604, 911, 716. [MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO] It's late. Well, they'll have my head for this. Listen, I had a great time. Whoopee. [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] [SCREAMS] It's all right. It's all right. It was just a nightmare. You're all right. You're all right, darling. You're all right. It was only a bad dream. It's like the others. Just a dream. That's all, a dream. [KNOCKS ON DOOR] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Who is it? SERGEANT WARD: Sergeant Ward. What do you want, Sergeant? I'd like to talk to your husband. CATHY: Can't it wait till morning, Sergeant? It's 3AM! SERGEANT WARD: Uh, no. Get back to bed, Cathy. I'll handle this. [DOOR CLOSES] All right, Sergeant. What's so important in the middle of the night? Kind of inconvenient hour, I guess, but there's been one or two things that have been bothering me and I thought I better talk to you. About what? Murder. Murder? Who? This little girl had her throat ripped out a couple hours ago. What does that have to do with me? Well nothing, doc. Just talking to a lot of folks. Been in all night, have you? Yes, of course. My wife will verify that. She don't have to do that, doc. You're not on the stand, know what I mean? You haven't told me what you wanted, Sergeant. Oh yeah. Well, you ever seen this before? The girl ripped it off, whoever attacked her. Are you implying that's mine? I guess if you've seen one bandage, you've seen them all. Right, doc? Night. Is everything all right? [DOOR CLOSES] Take these. They'd knock out an elephant. They'll help you with the nightmares. I'm not sure they were nightmares. Look, I'm not a psychiatrist-- far from it. But I think what happened is pretty obvious. You were running a very high fever, and you wandered out of your room. You spotted the nurse lying on the floor, dead. You panicked. You rushed back to your room. Now you're in a state of near coma. Then you distorted the sequence of events. In your mind, you killed the nurse. All right. You're a doctor. You didn't help her. Guilt. Same reason I'm here instead of up on the hill. What about the man I killed? I smashed his brains out. Let's look at that, huh? In your condition? You picked up a fully grown man. You fly him around your head like he's some kind of rag doll. You had a high fever. That's what produced the nightmares. Very real to you, but images. They were incredibly real. That's not unusual, is it? You know as well as I do, high fever can produce hallucination. What about that? There was no flesh left on my fingers. I can't get it back on now. Fever, man. You were perspiring heavily. It slipped off. That's what you think all that means? I don't know. It's your dream. He wants to stay in the hospital until the treatments are over, alone. I'd go along with him if I were you, Mrs. Beck. He's had a severe trauma. It's pretty rough. What can I do to help? Give him all the support he needs. No pressure. I think his mind will ease up just as soon as these treatments are over. For you. Thank you, sweetheart. Do you want one? No, not now. I talked to your mother. You didn't. Oh, you promised to call her, remember? What did you tell her? I told her you were fabulous. And she didn't insist on talking to me? Oh, she did, but I said you were asleep. Said the honeymoon was too much for you. Now I'm going to keep on hearing about grandchildren, you know that. Well? Well. Charlie, what's wrong? I'm tired. I have to get a little rest. I'll get the doctor. No, I want a little rest. That's all. Johnny, you-- Just get the hell out of here and leave me alone! Johnny. This isn't happening. It's in my mind. It's in my mind. Please, no. I must stay. I need help. Johnny? Johnny. Johnny, please open the door. I want to help you. Johnny! Johnny? [SIREN BLARES] DISPATCHER: Stolen ambulance last seen heading east on Nick Road. Suspect is wearing pajamas and a white terry cloth robe. Height, 6 feet, 160 pounds. Caucasian male. Apprehend. Do not shoot. Repeat, do not shoot. Patient heavily drugged from treatments received at the hospital. This is Sergeant Ward. Who is the patient who stole that ambulance? DISPATCHER: Male caucasian. What's his name? DISPATCHER: Beck. Dr. John Beck. This is unit one in pursuit of stolen ambulance. Now headed south on 14th Street. All units converge. This is Ward. All cars converge at Mill Road. Stolen ambulance west bound. Suspect homicidal. Of course he was with me all night. Every minute together and never apart, eh? What's the point of this, Sergeant? We had a young girl killed the other night over at King's Trailer Park. She died pretty much the same way as the nurse the other night. But that was an accident. I don't think so anymore, Mrs. Beck. Do you recognize this? No, should I? Found it in the trash barrel at your motel. So? Well the man who killed that girl was wearing it. I told you Johnny never left my side. Tell me this. When Dr. Beck ran off-- He didn't run off. He was hallucinating, and that was from the medication. Do you believe this medication could have made him violent? Johnny's never done a violent act in his life. Yeah. Yeah. Probably never stole an ambulance and smashed it to bits in his life either, you know what I mean? Gotcha! [LAUGHS] I'm sorry. Sorry, I thought you were somebody else, mind you. Drink? No, thank you. You don't look like the kind of fellow who runs around wearing only pajamas. You get a role or something? What's the matter? Oh. You're beginning to know the real me. You're one of the few people who's fortunate enough to know the real me, because I'm free, man. Free. Free as a-- shit. You know that whiskey and alcohol and all that stuff is depressing? Who do you suppose would want to take this stuff if they didn't want to be depressed? If you're so free and happy you don't want to be depressed, you want to stay free and happy, right? So if I'm so freaking free and happy, I would never even take a swig from this bottle, right? Right. I normally only take swigs, man. I drink it from the bottom of the bottle. And I get more and more depressed. I get so depressed I don't remember. And I goodbye another night or day. Or maybe a couple of nights, if I'm lucky. That's what I call real freedom, man. [LAUGHS] Ooh. Something wrong with your hand? I slipped and fell, I think, a couple of nights ago. I don't remember. Let me see that. Bingo! You found it. Let go, for Christ's sake. Your hand is broken. Are you a doctor? Ah, ah, ah. So you're a doctor and you dropped right on out. I understand that. I sure do. You know too much. Anybody who knows too much has got to drop out. You're quite a philosopher. That's me. Jack of all thoughts, master of none. You know when you walk along a railroad tracks, you got lots of time to think. Just thinking! No doing. If there's the slightest chance that I might start doing, I just naturally reach for a bottle. I can say for sure there's only one thing I can do better than anybody else in the world-- stink, right? Hey, doc. Have yourself a swig. You're looking awful. Go on. [CHOKING] I know the stuff's bad, but not that bad. [SQUEAKING] [CHOKING] Attention, APB. Dr. John Beck. Roll all units, every man. DISPATCHER: Yes sir, every man but Harmon. He's at the hospital with his wife. She just had a baby. I don't give a damn if she had quintuplets. Everybody. [INAUDIBLE] your feet. [MUMBLING] What's going on here? Dad? [MUMBLING] [YELLS] Professional job. Yeah. A humane act, if I ever saw one. [SQUEAKING] Come on. You can't walk the streets all night. Where could he be, Sergeant? You let me worry about that, Mrs. Beck. We'll find him. Come on. OK. Thank you, Sergeant. You're welcome. Here, let me do that. I know how rough it must be, Mrs. Beck. It's a bad time to be lonely. Thank you. Ah, forget it. Everybody needs a friend once in a while. Anything I can do. Sensitive young girl like yourself needs all the protection she can get. I'm all right. It's Johnny. Oh yeah. Him too. Tell me something, Mrs. Beck, how long have you been married? Almost a year. No, thank you. Things been going pretty good, have they? It's been very good. Johnny and I are very happy. Sure you are. I gotta ask those kind of questions. My business. He a physical type person, would you say? I don't know what you mean. Like sports, does he? That sort of thing. Well, yes. He's pretty athletic. He ever hit you? Hit me? Yeah, you know, folks with a temper sometimes do things like that. You know what I mean? No, Sergeant. Johnny has never hit me, and I don't like what you're getting at. Well what am I getting at, Mrs. Beck? We've been through that. Johnny's-- Johnny's not capable of hurting or killing anyone! Not Johnny. Not Johnny. There, there. It'll be all right. Please, you've got to help him. I'll do the very best I can, Cathy. No! [CRYING] Listen to me, lady. I'm the only one who can help him. Get out! Get out of here! Get out! Don't you worry about a thing, Mrs. Beck. I'll find him. (CRYING) Oh, Johnny. The dark area that we see on the left are where early explorers came into the cave. The rocks over which those people climb give us an idea of just how rough cave exploring may be. The rocks fell from the ceiling just a few years ago. By a few years, we mean somewhere in the neighborhood of 8,000 to 10,000 years, which is a small period of time in the total period that the cave has been here. But it's far enough back that we can say that everything that was loose or likely to fall fell thousands upon thousands of years ago. We are safer here from falling objects than we would be on the surface outside this mountain. We don't actually make comments on the rock to make people feel more safe, but really to a lot of people's eyes to adjust to the light conditions within the cavern. --and therefore, a stalagmite develops directly below a dripping stalactite. So when the stalactite goes down, there would be a droplet of water. The stalagmite goes up-- I think that everybody has a pretty good idea how stalactites develop. Water drips from the ceiling for a long period of time. Each drop of water that falls from the ceiling, a little tiny bit of mineral is left behind. Something the people aren't really familiar with, though, is that the little tiny bit of mineral-- DISPATCHER: Crash at five corners. Ambulance on way. Car nine, follow up. Car four, negative. Remain where you are. Car six, spot a UFO-- [TIRES SQUEALING] Oh, hello. Can I help you? Uh, yes. I'm Dr. Winston. Can you tell me where the anti-rabies vaccine is stored? In the cabinet. Thank you. You new around here too? [GASPING] Doctor. Dr. Winston? May I help you, please? What's the matter? Dr. Winston, please-- Doctor, I'm going to get some help. No! Please. Doctor! Oh, no! Don't scream. Instead, give me the key. What? [INAUDIBLE] Give me the key. Quickly. [SCREAMS] [CRYING] Oh! Open it. Doctor, please-- Open it! All right. [SCREAMS] [CRYING] [INAUDIBLE] hurting me. Where is he? He's in the pharmacy. You said you might have found him. JOHN: My name is John Beck. This is my last will and testament. My final communication with the outside world. Many will deny as possible the phenomenon-- the miracle-- which has forever altered my being-- emotionally, mentally, physically. A few, perhaps, will understand. I hope that you, Cathy, will be one of them. You are my one sorrow, the only regret that I take with me. Always remember I loved you. The first symptoms of my metamorphosis were strange and horrible. Medically indescribable. But now the metamorphosis is swift. Quite smooth. Painless. Natural. I welcome it. It is only then that I am fully the other being, this self dominates my personality. Human form and human emotion-- No. I won't listen. Don't you see? He's taking on the guilt for something he doesn't even understand. How can you believe something so irrational? You heard the same thing we heard, Mrs. Beck. That was a confession. A confession? From someone pumped full of medicine? He doesn't know what he's saying. I think it's more complex than that, Mrs. Beck. How he got there, that's out of my bailiwick. All I know is that you're listening to a voice of a killer. JOHN: Something within my psyche has emerged, has helped me reach a new consciousness. A sharp awareness of truth, untouched by human greed or ambition. Free from the negative, the hypocrite. Can you understand? I'm part of everything now. I've journeyed to a belonging. Oh god, turn it off. Please, turn it off. Do you think he really believes he's changed, doc? Yes. You say that kind of funny, doc. Like maybe you believe it yourself? I don't think you quite understand. He believes it, therefore it is true. JOHN: Don't. Johnny? Oh god. You did come back. JOHN: Keep your hand off the light, Cathy. It's all right. No one can see us. JOHN: I don't want you to see me. Johnny. Johnny, I love you. JOHN: Stay back! It's all finished, Cathy. What are you talking about? JOHN: Something you could never understand. Oh Johnny, please. Let me try. JOHN: Nothing can be the same, Cathy. Can't you understand that? Nothing. Let me help you. JOHN: Go home. Alone? I couldn't go without you, Johnny. JOHN: Go home, Cathy. But it's your home too! JOHN: No. What are you saying? The caves are my home. Who is it? You haven't seen your husband, have you? No, of course not. You mind if I come in? Yes I do, Sergeant. I'm in bed. It's very late. Had a report he was seen in the area. Good night, Mrs. Beck. Good night. JOHN: I've got to go. Oh! It's all right. You're all right. You look fine, Johnny. I can't control it, Cathy. I do change. No, you don't change, Johnny. You think there's a change of some kind, but that's because of the drugs. It's in your mind. Don't you see? It's nothing more than an allergic reaction. I'm leaving, Cathy. No! The police may be watching. Johnny. Johnny. I love you. No. No. I do, I do. And you love me, too. [CAR STARTS] [SCREAMS] Mrs. Beck? Mrs. Beck, are you all right? Mrs. Beck. Mrs. Beck, you must have been having a nightmare! Are you OK now? Yes, of course. I'm sorry. It must've really been a bad one. Listen, I'm heading back to the office now, but if you need me or if you have another one of those nightmares, you just give me a yell, OK? And I'll be over there all night. Don't you worry. Take it easy. I got no other place to go, believe me. OK? Good night, Mrs. Beck. DISPATCHER: Sergeant Ward, headquarters. Do you read me? Sergeant Ward, headquarters. Yeah, I read you. DISPATCHER: Mrs. Beck was here looking for you. She was hysterical. She kept babbling you killed her husband. She got a ranger to drive her to the cave. When? DISPATCHER: A few minutes ago. And I'll take care of it. 10 four. [HEAVY BREATHING] You're going to come along with me, peacefully. You know what I mean? [YELLING] Sergeant, is my husband all right? I don't know what he is. Well, what happened? I don't know what happened. All right, that's enough. Let's go. No. Listen. I don't hear anything. Strange. I hear something, but I don't know-- oh. What's wrong with you? Nothing you would understand. Get ready, Sergeant. [CAR STARTS] [SQUEAKING] [SQUEAKING] Oh my god! They're attacking us! What the hell's wrong with you? Can't you see what's happening? Yes, I see. [TIRES SCREECH] [THUD] Emergency. Emergency. This is Ward. Emergency. Emergency. Hey, what are you doing? Goodbye, Sergeant. [SQUEAKING] [YELLING] Get off! Get off! [YELLING] [GUN SHOT] VOCALIST: Take me to some place I dream of, where nobody goes. Where nothing grows. You say I have to. I want to go home. Go home.
