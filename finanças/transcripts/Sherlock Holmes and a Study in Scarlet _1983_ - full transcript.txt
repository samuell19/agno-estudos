Was it entirely necessary to round a herd of buffalo across the pathway repeatedly? Or had you drawn your own conclusions before the stampede? I, I've had much to do, inside, I mean. I was relying on my colleague to look after things out here. Your colleague? Mr. Lestrade. Ah, so, so. And what have you and your colleague, Lestrade, found out thus far? I believe I've... We've done all that can be done. How much is that? Deuce little. It's a queer business, very complex. You're stumped? No. Why send for us then? I thought you might be interested.

You've telegraphed Cleveland? Yes sir, asking for any information which might assist our inquiries. What information, specifically? About Stangerson! Nothing more crucial? No sir! Then telegraph again, man. This is my case, Mr. Holmes! I believe I've just solved it for you. Forget the "ifs" gentlemen. It's murder, right enough, and here is the name that will lead us to the murderer. ♪ Jimson, Mr. Lestrade, Evening News. It is my professional opinion that the word Rache is the name Rachel, and that the writer, undoubtedly the murderer, was disturbed before he had time to finish inscribing said name upon said wall. Is it true that Mr. Holmes is involved with the case? Mr. Holmes has volunteered his services, yes. And what is Mr. Holmes' opinion? ♪ Rot. Lestrade's conclusions? Wall piffle, my dear chap, utter tosh. 6'7" and three quarters. Splendid Watson. We are not looking for any Rachel. Indeed, far from it. You can't be certain. Indeed I can be. But where's the evidence? Everywhere. One finds what one seeks, young man. Although, it does help to know what one is looking for, rather, how to interpret what one is looking at. Mr. Holmes, recall our meeting earlier today. The wheel marks on the drive were fresh and deep. Since neither you nor Lestrade arrived by cab, they had to be made last night. But what's that mean? It means, Gregson, that two individuals arrived by cab during the night, and one of them was Enoch J. Drebber. The other, Stangerson? Perhaps, if Stangerson stands six feet tall, wears hobnail boots, and has long nails on the fingers of his right hand. A few observations only, Gregson, though they may assist you in apprehending the murderer. Oh, we are looking at murder then? A very complicated murder, Watson. No, it's too fantastic. There's nothing to work on but a body, a ring, a half-finished word. You couldn't deduce so much from so little. Again, recall our earlier meeting. You found me studying a puddle. Drebber wore patent leather shoes and walked around the puddle. His murderer, however, wore hobnail boots and stepped across the puddle. A stride of four feet taken without effort and indicating legs long enough to substantiate a height of at least six feet. Very well. What about the finger nails? Ah, observe the word. It was inscribed with a forefinger. See how the plaster has been scratched around the down stroke. Whoever wrote the word with his forefinger had untrimmed nails. Elementary? Quite so. Then who is Rachel? A figment of Lestrade's imagination. You discovered the body, Constable Rance? First upon the scene, sir. After you had found the body and raised the alarm, what did you see then? Well sir, uh, confusing it was, but I, yes, I saw a...a drunkard sir. I saw a man far gone in liquor. Describe him. Well sir, he were a long chap. Six feet and more? Easily that, sir. Muffler covering half his face, long brown coat, only... now that you've forced me mind to it, I don't think the bloke was tied at all. No, Constable, neither do I. Is it important, do you think so? Perhaps. What became of him? I shooed him off, sir, sent him about his business. Was he carrying a whip? Not as I recall, sir. Hmm. And whoever she may be, the mysterious Rachel is the heart of this grim and terrible business. What did Constable Rance have to say? He gave me the identity of the murderer. Rachel? There is no Rachel. There is a woman involved, of course. The wedding ring we found shows that, but she is long dead. But the name on the wall! Do you notice anything about it? Well, it is a medieval script, Germanic. Exactly, but contrived, my dear fellow. Are you up in languages, Watson? Some Pashto, a smattering of Hindi. I can negotiate the menu in a French restaurant. No German? R-A-C-H-E in German is rache, which means revenge, Watson. Someone else is going to die. ♪ The plot thickens, Watson. I have an answer to my American telegram. My view of the case is the correct one. What is your view of the case, Holmes? Do you still have your service revolver, Watson? -Yes. -Better clean and load it. He will be a desperate man. -Who? -The murderer. He'll be calling this evening between eight and nine. Read this. "Found. In Brixton Road this morning, a plain gold wedding ring. Apply: Dr. Watson, 221B Baker Street between eight and nine this evening." Excuse me for using your name, old fellow. My fiddle would be better for new strings. That "G." Assuming anyone does apply, I don't have a wedding ring to give them. This will do. Keep your pistol ready. When the fellow comes, speak to him calmly and don't alarm him by looking at him too hard. But why should the murderer be anxious for this ring? It's precious to him, Watson, more precious than a man's life. The murderer will risk anything rather than lose the ring. I believe he dropped it while stooping over Drebber's body. After leaving the house, he discovered his loss and hurried back and found Constables Rance and Murcher already there. Yes, but who is he? Stangerson? Definitely not. That telegram you received this morning told you as much? Yes. We are being followed, Watson. ♪ Clumsy Wiggins, that won't do, boy. No fooling you, Mr. Holmes. Call your men. (whistles) ♪ The Bakers Street Irregulars, these youngsters go everywhere and see everything. They're as sharp as needles and worth a dozen men in blue. That we are! That we are too!

Mr. Gregson's compliments, sir, and would you join him at the station? He's got the Brixton murderer, sir. His name is Arthur Charpentier, Leftenant in Her Majesty's Navy. His mother runs a boarding house in Torquay Terrace, where Drebber and Stangerson stayed prior to coming up to London the day before yesterday. You got a confession from him? Not yet. What I do have is evidence and motive. The American Exchange had no forwarding address for Enoch J. Drebber. I traced him through the label in his hat. Underwood and Son's Candlewell Road. The men at Underwood's remembered making the hat for an American gentlemen living at Torquay Terrace. He wasn't a gentleman. He was an animal, a drunken, bullying animal. He treated my sister abominably. And that is why you killed him, Leftenant Charpentier, because of your sister. I didn't kill him. I felt like it, but I didn't. No. How tall are you, Lieutenant? Tall? Why? 5'9". That proves the young man's innocence, Gregson. Sorry, Mr. Holmes. I've got the man and the motive. Good morning, gentlemen. Who's he? The Brixton murderer. I've had him in custody for five hours. Then he isn't the murderer. You've found Stangerson? I have indeed, at Halliday's Private Hotel. What's he got to say? Nothing. Mr. Joseph Stangerson was killed by a deep knife wound to the left side, which penetrated the heart. Who discovered the body? Me, sir. The gentleman asked to be called for breakfast. I come up and there he was, blood everywhere, cold. Hmm, and you? I'm the milkman, sir. You saw the murderer. I did, sir. He was climbing out that very window there. A ladder was up against the wall outside. I thought he was the hotel carpenter. Man you saw was tall, wearing a long brown overcoat? A scarf and that, that's him, all right. Hobnail boots? Yes. "Cleveland, October the 3rd. J.H. is in Europe." ♪ Strychnine. And the other pill? Aspirin. I don't need a microscope to tell me Stangerson wasn't poisoned, Mr. Holmes. No, but Drebber was. What? Right. I may have miscalculated here. There will be no more murders. Oh yes? Certain of that, are you? I'm as certain as I am of the murderer's identity and whereabouts. No. Do not press me for that information, gentlemen.
