How is it going? Keep it up. - Shall I call the cops? - Back you to your posts. Get out! Open your eyes. Maybe he's not alone. Get in, shithead. I hit him with a right, That straightens him up! I smash him with another right, right between the eyes. The blood spurts all over the wall... As if we'd painted over! Those little punks don't respect anything. We must crack down. Sister, your husband is a tough guy! Aren't you going to open a Zara branch? If they fill a request, why not. If they fill a request. There are more and more thieves. - Don't you have mercy on them? - How could they have mercy? It's not easy to make ends meet... Everything is upside down... Nothing is torn at least? No, it's just a bit dusty. I thought I had torn it when I caught him. Stop it. It's not for play. You're not funny! You know I hated you before we started going out. Really? You were crazy in love! - Me? - Yes, you. You were never laughing, You were playing tough. It's too late to change your mind now. Be careful, I'm not afraid of divorcing. Really? Who's not funny now? - I don't know how to laugh? - No you don't. You should look at you in the wedding pictures. - You got them? - Yes, I have them... How are they? Are they beautiful? You never smile. You look like you've been forced. I was shy. All these women, this food, the buddies... I missed you today. I missed you too. The company receives 500 DH for the commission. You directly negotiate the price for the maid. We just ask you to tell us the price once set. Money is not an issue. I want a girl I can trust. I have no time nor wish to keep my eyes on her. My girls are good girls and the police never set foot here. Call one of them just to see. Have you ever worked for a big family? For my family. We are eight. You seem very sweet. Sure! She just got married. Your husband must take care of you. And keep an eye on you. Malika... Zahra... Malika... Zahra... I never knew how to choose. Our nanny was named Zahra. She spent her whole life with us. May she rest in peace. Well, it will be Zahra. Here is a copy of her ID card. It's on the house. Enjoy. - No, thanks. - What do you mean, no? You will eat anything if it's free. They fry it in pork fat. Nobody knows where the meat comes from. - What pork? - They're American frozen fries? It's the best fries ever. You can eat, trust me. It's full of chemical stuff. What chemical stuff? Chemical preservatives. You're starving or what? There is pork in it. Yeah right. There can't be much of it. How much pork in a lousy fry? The sin has nothing to do with much or little. Kill five men or one, you're still a criminal. - I killed no one. - You understand shit. Hicham, can you change the order for us? OK, just let me have a little break. Just bring us crisps. It's the same, it's all American. We must boycott. Our target is the middle and upper class. Yes, but the mall is full. But not with the right customers. True. They're just here. They hang around but buy nothing. As if they just come to queue up! May I? Many people come to enjoy the air conditioning. So let's turn it off. We need to change the people, not the mall. What is your name? Abdelkader. He is very good. He's the one catching all the thieves. Thieves? What do you mean, thieves? Not huge robbers! Young kids who steal petty things, that's all! If you catch one, no mercy. And send him to the cops. We can't beat people up. If I may. We send them over, but the police release them. So Abdelkader! We don't give up. Break apart every one you catch. Come and eat. It's gonna get cold. Because you let it go cold. You ripped apart that poor chicken. Why being mean? Come! But where? Look! There is no room. You're plenty. Cram off! When I look at you I'm not hungry anymore. Come, father-in-law, I'm done. No, sit down, Malika. Come on my daughter, sit. You are our guest. You went out to get drunk again. Of course not. - He drank again? - Aren't you ashamed? Leave me alone, I didn't drink! Shut your eyes. All of you. - Wait! - What? - I knew it, you found the stash. - What stash? You went out to waste the money in bars. I didn't take anything! You live like a lord, while I save every penny! Are you a man? You waste your wife's money on alcohol. Of course I'm a man! Who brought you to this world? You have no dignity. Look at yourself! - You're a scumbag! - Who's the scumbag here? - I curse you, you and your mother! - Stop now! Go to bed. Immediately. He's going to bed. He's quieting down for Malika. I would have chastened you with my belt. A man! You don't know what it is. Better off to bed. Eat! I hope it's poisoned! Do your number! Eat Malika, eat. Hide those fences! Quick. Sorry, it's out of order. Out of order? I'm not blind. That's the way it is. Security measures. Only for me! And the others no? Yeah, for them it's working. You take me for a fool or what? Don't argue too much. Those are the orders. Don't get on my nerves and use the stairs. It's a disgrace, I won't use the stairs! Try to come back. I'll break your bones. Eh, the escalators are forbidden! Come down! It's out of order! What are you doing? They have no right to use the escalators. Are you trying to ruin me? I remember you saying: "this escalator is like your little brother, "you must take care of him, "and people are like germs. They can make it sick." I never said that! Or it was just an example. And germs give us life. There are good and bad germs. Your job is also to tell them apart. I'm taking out three days of your pay. What? For doing my job! I can't give this a pass, or it'll be anarchy. It'll serve as an example. That's bullshit. You're wrong! Don't take that tone with me. You'd rather apologize. I'm not a two faced bitch. I'm not gonna beg. You really had to hit him? You're a good person. Why are you doing this? That asshole made me lose my button. Don't come to me with stories where you beat people up. As for the button, I'll sew one for you tomorrow. You don't get it. Those uniforms are unique. They come from an American base that shut down. Look at those buttons. Shiny and beautiful. I will never find the same one. They warned us so the day they gave them. Haven't you seen a button like this? No, check downstairs. Here you go! You found it? Where? The escalators must have brought it upstairs. Thanks, you're an ace. - Thanks very much. - You owe me one. Go back to your post now. What? A woman regretted not hiring me. She called to give me the job. But Lhajja advises me to tie my hair to keep my job or to stop using make-up. And if I decide to wear a veil, it's even better. She's right. I'm your husband and I have the right to ask you to do so. But I've never imposed the veil on you. But I'd be happy if you'd wear it. You don't get it. Lhajja doesn't preach to convince me. She thinks you have a beautiful wife... Listen, since the lady of the house gets to chose the maid, she'll never want a beautiful girl like me. I don't know... I'm lost. Put on the veil. It protects the wife. I'll have peace of mind. I don't want to. When I go out with you, men eat you with their eyes. One day, I'll gouge them out of someone. Come over here. You'll be in charge of my room. And you'll call me Lalla. You suffocate me with your scarves. Zahra, show her around the house. The garden with flowers of all colors. The bed is huge. Embroidery in the curtains. The fridge is packed. The children's room, if you'd see it, you'd want plenty of them. It's the most important room of the house. No, the most important is my garage with my two cars. One for winter, one for summer. One for you, one for me. You don't have a license. Neither do you. I'll learn fast. Because me, I'm a cunt. No. This is not what I meant. No, you said I was unable to learn. This is not what I meant. You're easily frightened, you couldn't drive, that's all. Who cares about licenses? We'll have drivers. Mostapha is a good driver, no? And Lhajja will be our maid. And your father the gardener... He never worked a day in his life. Better a taster in the kitchen. He doesn't even bless the bread for lunch. You're right after all, I'm easily scared. I grew up with fear. How can you enjoy life? Scared of being hungry, scared of having no job, scared they'd cut the power, scared not to pay back the debts. Scared of the parents, scared of men, and men scared of their bosses. I'm scared of Lhajja, Lhajja is scared of Lalla, and Lalla of her husband maybe... We're afraid of one another. We can't live together. You're kidding! I'm afraid of no one. With me, forget the fear. But you're afraid of God. Of course. Thank God I'm afraid of Him. Well no, I think we shouldn't be afraid of God. Madam! This is not a stable here. It's a respectable place. You must wait in line like everybody else. Who are you? You don't know who you're talking to. Those are the orders. You are a human being and they're not! Get off me, little scumbag. - What disregard! - Shameful! - Wait for your turn. - Get off me! - Get off me, little cunt! - You don't understand! You're gonna teach me what I shall do? You gonna regret it all your life! Wait and see. - That's right, get out of here! - Well done boss! Such a pain in the neck... Wait. What's happening here? - A cunt thought she had all the rights. - Come with me! I need to watch over the queue! Didn't you see they opened the escalators? No, for her? For whom else? For me? Say your wife is a whore. Say it! He is like his grandfather. He also thought he was a leader. He led the workers strike at the cement plant. They came to beat him up, right in front of us. He ended up in a wheelchair. They broke him down, and it broke us along. Your son had it coming. Who is he to take a crack at people of well off families? He doesn't know they can make him disappear. Strength makes you stupid. He didn't do anything. It's not the time to blame him. We must feed him. You're right. But I'm helpless. We have no money, and know no one in the police. Looking for him? Go to the morgue. They're not gonna miss him! And even if he's alive, he'll go to jail. I'm not against it. Jail will teach him a lesson. I'm tired of working in houses. Nothing has changed in my life, not my food, not the room I rent. And my daughter still lives with my mother in the village. I've grown up doing nothing but chores. I'd like going to the plant! At least, people would hit on us at the end of the day. We were less unhappy. Feel lucky, you have a man. If I go on doing house cleaning, I'll never marry. He's not home. I don't know if he's alive or dead. We women we feel like we were their mothers! He must be having fun somewhere else! Tomorrow he'll come back crying and you'll act like nothing happened. It's not like him. They will miss you. They'll never find someone like you. You were managing it all with mastery. Since you've left, we feel lost. What are you looking for? I'm talking to you, answer! Answer! You gave me everything and you took everything from me. Do you need anything? Because you're coming back! You'll bring me back a perfume from the airport! Take back this coffee, he may go and drink it at his lolita's place. For the last time, do you need anything? What have you left me? You've sold everything. Except this villa. I've sold everything to pay back our loans. So you don't have to deal with it after I'm gone. I didn't sell to pocket the money and leave with it. I hate you. Don't hate me. And don't love me. Just forget me. Shut that window. Sit down next to me. Sit down. Your presence soothes me. I just want to tell you, trust me wholeheartedly. What I saw will remain between us forever. My life too is upside down now. But God loves us all. Consider me as your little sister. What are you talking about silly girl? Last time... But really. Go and meet Zahra. She is here already. I am so happy to see you! What a joy! I missed you daughter! What a great day! You like it? Very beautiful. I need to iron it. Wait. Take this one. It'd suit you perfectly. Hey! Hey you! Get in. Get in. We'll set the price as we drive. Come or I'll get out to put you in the truck. What did this asshole want with you? They think they can do anything with their cars! You saw how you're dressed? You bring them on! Where do those whore's clothes come from? I put it on for you... Leave me. How have you treated me! I would have ruined him, if I had caught him. Alright, come. I can't... Not here... Mostapha is around... And your comment... I feel more like a whore with you here than with the guy outside. Bring me back home please. Stay for a bit. Let's have a walk in the center. In 1h30 Mostapha comes back, I give him the keys and we leave. Bring me back to the bus and come back if you wish. You came in time. Help him, he can't catch a hen. Who brought all these chickens? The political parties had their local meeting for the elections. They offered two chickens to each person in attendance. I pushed your father in front of me and we did two parties today. So what? We need to take advantage, once they win, they disappear. Shame! People stared at us with contempt. Two chickens here, two chickens there. Opportunists who play all sides. I, the son of a great unionist. I end up like a traitor. Your drunkard's pride has stopped feeding us for a long time. You'll be happy eating those chickens. You'll forget your father's union, and your pride too. Where are the girls? The girls? I sold a chicken and I bought them some tissue boxes. You are mad! I told you never to send them to sell anything in the streets. For that you should have kept your job like a real man. She left. With whom? Alone. She's not four years old! We took care of her enough. We married her. We're not going to carry on until our death. Why do you speak of her like this? If you want to stand for her, take care of her. Find a job and take charge of her. You are her husband, aren't you? Now buzz off. Any problem? Not at all. If there's one man on earth with no problem, it's me. "In the name of God the merciful... "God doesn't lay upon a soul more than it can bear" You see: "what she can bear" I've exploded it and I'm alive. Nothing can reach me anymore. I have no room for problems. You for instance, you can be my problem now. But I'm really sorry, I have no room. You are saved. You don't exist for me. But I can be your problem. You know why? Because your soul carries nothing. You have no problem. And if I choose so, I become your problem. Of course, I'm nothing for you. You don't see me. You turn your face away. Because all that surrounds you here is made so you shall see nothing. The game is devised in such way. Go somewhere else. Please. Work, work... Don't worry. We never see things as they happen. Who may claim he sees the train when he sits in it? A few succeed in doing so. Like prophets. I've listened to you, enough now. Let me work, get away! And I decide to stay here. Or even more right in your place? I don't want no problems. Please. Guys! Guys! Come over! Stop Abdelkader! Go on, I'll meet you right away. Enough... - I've tried everything with him... - Shut up. Look at this city, it doesn't look like anything anymore... Thieves, liars, fags, foreigners, black Africans and AIDS, assholes and pimps... Only filth... Don't you put on the kohl? Are you afraid? Kohl is for girls! Girls! You understand shit. Tell me, I hope you know what you're doing? Enough. It stings my eyes. Get down. What is your surprise? A kiss first! Who are you? The police. - You think you're in Sweden! - That's not your business! You drink! You kiss! Infidels! Come around here, fucking bastard. We are decent people. If you want money, he may give you some... But don't hurt me. Please. He's my fiancé. Sure! So I can't ask for the wedding certificate! You have your license? You have your license? No, but I know how to drive. It's alright. She can drive. Good. Give her the keys of the car. Give him your cell phone. Bring her here. Come with me. Don't be afraid. Come here. Listen carefully. I forgive you this time. But don't hang around here anymore. Now leave. Get off me. You are not humans. You are beasts. Yes we're beasts because we still have mercy. While your race has none of it. Talk to him! Pick it up and get out of my sight. That'll teach you to abuse poor young girls. I leave you the uniform here. What's this? What! Alcohol! After three dry years, you want to relapse. You want to do like I did upon my return. I drank like a dog. I blame myself everyday for that. I don't want to drink it. I want to sell it. You think I'm dumb. It's already open. I'd sell it by the glass to the guys in the neighborhood... I need money right now. I'm broke. You drink, you sell, you pour you mingle with drinkers... You'll end up committing all the sins... Oh fuck. Give me a break with your speeches. I'm fed up with it. Fries cooked in pork, sin. Khol on the eye, good deed. And this girl we roughed up. You want to send me to jail! What jail? I hate myself thinking of what we did. You make me sick. Leave me alone. If I follow you, I'll end up drinking gas, not only alcohol. What are you doing here? Stop that bus. And now you beg... You want me to kill myself... Why this happens only to me! I'm gonna turn mad! Everything is against me! We have nothing left to eat... You're white as a sheet, what's going on? I've had a fight. Again? You'll end up in jail. That would be for the best. How? I'll be better off in there. I need to be busted before I kill someone. I feel I could do it. It's too much for one man alone. Come and I'll shave you. You look like a bum. - Yes, you go. - I don't have any money. Go. I'll cover you. You changed your phone? No, only the ringtone. I'll be back. It's Tima again. I know. I see that you still have my phone... I'm calling you because I feel you're not like your buddy, And you'll do what's fair. I got terribly scared, you know. But you're gonna give it back, right? Of course I will give it back to you. I'm not calling many people, you know. You know, when you call me, I have like a fever. You're sweet. My God, your voice. I've never heard such sweetness. When can we meet? I'd like to get my pictures and contacts back. And what if I can't? Tell me when. But don't be too long. Don't worry. Come and sit next to me. I told you I'd be selling this villa and move to Casa. Alone. I can't stand this city and its people anymore. But before I leave, I'm gonna throw a big party. Bring a glass. Do you want to come with me? I'll take care of you. And the day you want to marry, I'll give you a princess' wedding. You know someone? What does he do? Listen to me carefully. Don't rush it. You're still young and beautiful. Listen Abdelkader, you and Malika are both good people. But together, it doesn't work anymore. She couldn't stand to live one more day with you. The Abdelkader she loved is no more. A fight or a thief again. Let's move away. This radio bugs me. Leave the music on. Precisely, this music puts me to sleep. I've never understood the music you love. And when did you understand anything of me? Leave your Faty to us a bit. We soon miss each other you know... It's not worth it... Please! Don't take advantage to listen to my messages! Wait. He taught him a good lesson. Now he must have understood who he was dealing with. Bravo Simohamed! Long live order! When they change the constitution, I told him: "Those savages only understand the whip." Halima wait! Can I show her the video? Show this to your leftist billionaire. He'll know how to treat his workers. Instead of giving them theater classes! What do you want darling. He's mad, thankfully he's rich. What's the flavor? People have turned mad! Go and see it with Lalla Khiti. Loka mustn't see that. - "- Say: my wife is a whore. - My wife is a whore." - "-Say: I am a faggot. - I am a faggot." Stop dreaming, get the second platter. And it's not the end of his misery... I told him, I don't want the new year to start with you in this town. Disappear. I'm gonna ruin his life! Bastards. He will pay. He keeps on humiliating me in front of people. No, no. Let's leave. There is nothing to do in this town anymore. Let's leave and start our life again elsewhere. I'm unable either to live or die. So I'm nothing for you. You're everything, without you I die... I never thought you could give up on me! You've changed. I didn't recognize you anymore. We can't do anything against those people. We'll always be the losers. Let's leave. You and me. You and me alone. Look at this town of infidels. They celebrate Christmas! All we needed was Santa Claus! Would you see the French or the Americans buy a lamb and celebrate the Aid EIKebir themselves? And slaughter it according to tradition? Prepare the sheep's feet with chickpeas? We celebrate Christmas more than our own holidays. We need a proper tsunami in this country. A wave of 300 meters high and wipes the slate clean of this town of sins. But they celebrate the new year like everyone, not Christmas. I'm talking to the Sir, never to the wife of another. Go on straight. We're gonna pass the station. The train leaves in two hours. Go to the Hacienda's villas. Fine. Stop right away! I told you to stop the taxi. We'll be there in 3 minutes, brother. Don't worry, we'll take the train. Trust me, I won't do anything wrong. There's nobody here. They all spend New Year's Eve in bars and hotels. I know this house very well. I'm gonna enter through the kitchen door. I take some important files. He's corrupt, I'll have evidence. The files will be useless. I'm gonna make him regret the humiliation he made me endure. Go on, climb. You're gonna leave me alone? Climb. - Don't leave me alone. - It'll be a minute. Come back quick. Be quick, quick. "It's your new year's present" How? Don't do anything, I'm on my way. Idiots, what did you do? Where is he? In the garden, sir.
