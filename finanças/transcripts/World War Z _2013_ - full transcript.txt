This is J. T. L. Morning News. This is Holly Chadwick. Thanks for joining us. We have a great show in store for you this morning. Well, it's a great morning to be in the studio. Authorities have confirmed an avian flu outbreak. Forecast, cloudy skies... Good morning. Reporting from Brighton. This will be a different scenario if the virus changes in a way that allows transmission between humans. So, let's get started. Yet again today, another group of dolphins became stranded. CO2 emissions have dramatically increased in... Are there any real threats that you know of? Not at all. Environmentalists are trying to determine the cause of death. At alert level six, W. H. O. guidelines for governments... Your socks are so cute! I like them. Police say they've seen similar cases recently of people behaving strangely. The U. N. health agency is not likely to recommend official travel restrictions. It's a little bit unsettling. They're not physicists. They're not engineers. They think it's just gonna go away. They live in a fantasy parallel universe. Right on top of the man, beating him. The man is bleeding. Twenty-one confirmed cases. All the talk about a doomsday is a big hoax. The subject growled at him and continued to maul the victim. The best estimate is about 15,000 in the U. K. We don't know if this is spreading. Rhythms of change... So far there's no manifestation. Monitors have arrived, even carrying them... With that much public at risk, we cannot... They're trying to move us on, trying to tell the journalists to get out. Wake up! Oh, creatures in our bed... No sleeping! Oh, you're getting very big. - What do you want to eat? - Pancakes! We got a lot more sunshine today. You have to only say one word. Hey, by the way, what do you want for your birthday? Say a puppy. A puppy. You mean a stuffed animal puppy? Because that we can do. Good morning. That looks yummy. She gets the bigger one? - Yeah, sorry. - She's tiny. Did you pack your inhaler? Bathroom sink. - In a minute? - Scootch! Go. The government has declared martial law. Daddy, what's martial law? Martial law is like house rules, but for everybody. Were you ever in places like that with your old job? But I quit my old job so I could be with you. Do you miss it? No, I like my new job. All you do is make pancakes in the morning! Yeah, but I'm really good at it. Look who I found! Here comes the number 12 train! It's not Subway Sam, is it? You want more pancakes? Good. Go, go, go. Come on, scootch! - At least... - Move it on out. Hey! Plates in the sink! - Later! - Do that when we get back! Does it live in the jungle? No. Do you eat it on Sundays? No. Does it live on the Great Plains of Africa? - Yeah. - Oh, well, I guess, yeah. Do people keep it in pens all its life and harvest it for meat? - That's really gross! - Gross! Dad! Is it an animal you'd have for a pet? - Yes. - Is it a cat? Yes. - Okay, now we have another one. - Do another one. You totally got one! Why are there so many? It's like, three in the last five minutes. What is going on? The World Health Organization has been tracking the recent outbreak of rabies that began in Taiwan and has now been reported in over 12 countries. Responding to allegations he hasn't done enough to prevent the spread... Can we try BBC? You're not British anymore, baby. You lost your accent a long time ago. Except after two bottles of wine. Am I British? Yeah, your grandma is. Hey! He's just gonna keep going, Daddy? Hold on, guys. Daddy, be careful on the road. It's okay, baby. Can be transmitted between species commonly from a bite from an infected animal. Our best recommendation is to stay away from densely populated areas. Hey, yo! You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. - You need anything? - No. You know what's going on? No, man, I don't know anything. It's crazy. Gerry? Get back in your car right now! Remain with your ve... What are we doing? That's our way out of here. I want my blanket! Baby, it's packed right now. Snuggle with Subway Sam, okay? My blanket! Rach? Rachel, baby, you've got to get back in your seat. - Baby, we need you in your seat. - Put your belt on! Rachel, right now! - Gerry? - Rach, get your belt back on! - You Okay? - You Okay? - Rachel, sweetheart? - Rachel, you hurt? - Connie? - Are you okay? It's okay. We should get out. Everybody out of the car. We've got to get out of the city. Her door won't open! Rachel, go out that side. Okay, you have to climb over, honey. Out of the way! Move it! Come on, honey. Come on. Sweetheart, are you okay? Let's go. Let's get off the street. What is that, Gerry? What is that? I don't know! Get to the RV. Subway Sam! Here comes the number 12 train! One. Two. - What's happening? - Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Train's in the station! Gerry! Watch out! We're pulling back on Fifth Street! Containment is a fail. Try to relax. Give yourself air. In and out. Come on, baby, try to relax. Gerry? We left my purse in the car. Where's her spare? I'm gonna go check your backpack, all right? Do you want to be with her? Rach, you'll be all right. You're gonna be all right. Hey, hey, you breathe through your nose. Rach, Rach, look at me. Look at me. You're gonna be all right. You've done this a hundred times. Look at me. Look at me. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth. Okay, we're gonna go to a pharmacy. We gotta move. Okay. Good. Good. Look. Look at me, look at me. Rach, breathe through your nose. No, no, no, no... You're gonna be all right. - Look at me. - Daddy, what are those things? Honey, find us some water. Okay? Something to drink. It's Thierry. Where are you? Airborne. Lower East Side to Turtle Bay. It's all gone. We barely made it out. - Tell him to go south. - No, no, we need visual confirmation. No,no,no,no,no,no,no. What is this? We don't know. How close were you? Face to face. Good, honey, good. Daddy. Connie, give me that. Give me that. Oh, thank you, honey. Where are you? 95, heading north. Okay. Okay. All right. We'll try to get a helicopter to you. I'll call you back with an extraction point. Can you hold out for another hour? Do we have a choice? This is not for old time's sake, my friend. I'll need you. I need you back. Don't forget about us. What do you mean, we've lost Boston? All right. Good luck, Gerry. Okay. Good, honey. Keep it going. It's gonna be all right. - Come here. Stay close. - Super close. Take my hand. Get her medicine, I'll get us something to eat. I'll meet you back here. Stay close, honey. What do you need? Albuterol. They outgrow the asthma supposedly. And this shit, too. It's magic for my kid. Thank you. - Daddy! - Connie? Daddy! - Connie? - Daddy! - Where's Mommy? - Gerry! Gerry! Karin? - Karin? - Gerry! Gerry! Get off of me! Get off of me! That's all I have. - Gerry! - Hey! - Hey! - Gerry. Multiple 11-99s at Washington Park. Please, send units. We're falling back on Reed Street. Two Robert 12, units need backup. Mobile ops is down. Please respond. Two Robert 12, are you there? Copy. - Girls! - Responders, Code 3, Code 3. Rachel, quick, come on. No. No! We got to get out of here. We got to get off the street. Gerry. Apartments? Hey. Yeah. - Gerry? - We're in Newark. We're stranded. Apartment buildings, 23rd. If we can get to the roof, can you get someone to us? - Not tonight. - When? The earliest would be sunrise. Sunrise. Tell him I got flares. We'll be on the roof with flares. Listen, Gerry, I will move mountains to get you out here. Come here, baby. Go! Go! Go! - Baby, in here! - Come on. Quick! Gerry! Inside, girls! By the stairs. Inside, inside! Wait! Wait. Up, up. It's okay, baby. Run! Run! Go, Rachel! - Go! - Go! Keep running, baby. - It's all right. - To the top. Go! Go! Go! Run! Go! Go! Go! Go! I need a new flare! This asshole's about to get through! Where's Connie? Connie? - Connie? - Connie! - Let me in! - Connie! - Baby? - It's not her. It's not her. - Let me in! - Connie! Let me in! In, in, in! In! Thank you so much. - I'm Tomas. - Hey, Tomas. My mom's cooking everything before it starts to stink. That's smart. You guys all right? It's all right. It's okay. Are you guys hungry? Yes, thank you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. You want some juice? The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Jersey State Police Department. Authorities recommend that the following actions should be taken by all the members of the public. Stay indoors if at all possible. Have enough food and water supplies for sheltering for one to two weeks. The following message is transmitted at the request of the New Jersey State Police Department. An unidentified virus strain is rapidly spreading across the state of New Jersey. She was crying. Thanks, Tommy. I used to work in dangerous places and people who moved survived, and those who didn't... Movement is life. You have a better chance if you come with us. You need anything else before you leave? Okay. Come on. Come on. We should have left with them. There is nowhere to go. What's going to happen when the food is gone? Okay, come on. I'm scared. Connie, there's a helicopter waiting for us on the roof. Keep your eyes on Mommy and Daddy, okay? Be ninja quiet. Just a walk in the park. How do we know they're coming? They're coming. Ready? Okay, come on, guys. Come on! Come on! Up, up, Up. Come on, baby. Go, go, go! - Come on, baby! - Go, go! Go, girls! Gerry! Come on. Gerry! Girls, get back! Watch out! - Go! - Go, go, go! Come on, faster, girls! Lieutenant, I've got no contact. I say again, no contact. Let's go, let's go! Karin! - Karin! - Yeah. Go through the door! Gerry? There they are! Ace, we have positive contact. That's our target! Get us down! Daddy! - Daddy! - Baby, get back. Daddy! Gerry? - Gerry, what? - Stay back! Baby! No! One thousand seven. One thousand eight. Daddy, get off the edge! - Gerry, please? - One thousand ten. One thousand eleven. I got it in my mouth. You're okay. You're okay. Go! Go! Come on. Come on. Let's go! Let's go! Come on, let's go! We got to go! You got her? Let's go, let's go, let's go! Traffic en route, altitude 5-7 thousand. Heading 250. Turn right, heading 075, once clear. Remain below 4, 000. Clear to land, heading 040, wind 060 at five. Follow L. S. O. directions. Prep for immediate dust off. Gerry. Thank you. Good to see you, my friend. Tango five, this is Argus command. Cleared for take-off. Tango five. Wilco. Karin, to the right. This is good, right? Bunk beds! Your bunk beds are number two, three and six. Please make yourself at home. You want to get up here? - There you go, sweetheart. - That's good. We're not dropping anchor again. You're safe. It's not me I'm worried about. They're safe. Baby. It's bigger than our old apartment on 72nd. Need anything, Karin? Water. I'll organize. Is this worldwide? Is anyone doing better than we are? Baby. Go talk somewhere else. Okay. The President is dead. Four of six Joint Chiefs. V.P. missing. Reports of gun battles in the streets of the capital. Your parties are panicking. The bigger cities are the worst off. The airlines were the perfect delivery system. Carnival cruise vessel Dream has been given permission to join. Twenty seven knots south and closing. How soon are they showing symptoms after contact? The provisional government currently considers northern Minnesota to be a potential safe zone. Have you recorded any instance where a person was bitten but not infected? How the hell do I know if Russia's fallen? Sir, I cannot action that order. Colonel, I'm sorry, but we cannot facilitate an evacuation for you or your men. Sir, there is nowhere to evacuate you to. Malnutrition. Dirty water. No gas for the winter or transportation. No bullets to fight. And it has spread to all corners of the globe. The question that we have got to address is what the hell is it? About 5% of the population aren't affected immediately. It is viral. it has to be viral. There is no plausible alternative. And like any virus, once we find its origin, we can develop a vaccine. - We find it, contain it... - That's Dr. Fassbach. Virologist from Harvard. The analogy I keep coming back to is Spanish Flu. Spanish Flu? It didn't exist in 1918, but by 1920, it killed 3% of the world. He's our best bet at figuring out what this thing is. You all read the same email I did, and it said "zombies. " Are you completely out of your mind? So, the earliest mention of the word "zombie" was in a memo from Camp Humphreys in South Korea. We haven't had contact with them since. But this could lead us to the origin. If we knew where this thing started, then we'd have a chance of developing a vaccine to stop it. So we send in Dr. Fassbach there to look for the source. He's just a kid. You're right. Attention on deck! At ease! Mr. Under-Secretary. The Under-Secretary here says you were his best investigator when you were at the U.N. I want to send you in. With a team. Help Dr. Fassbach find whatever it is he needs. You brought... I wanted for the circumstances to speak for themselves. No. Captain, I'm not your guy. You were on the ground during the Liberian Civil War. Investigated Chechen war crimes. Sri Lanka in '07. Places you and I both know Dr. Fassbach wouldn't last a night in. Gerry, a handful of SEALs will go with you as security force. No. My guys will get you in, you assist the doctor, pursue any leads, my guys will get you out. We do the heavy lifting. I can't help you. I can't leave my family. Take a look around here, Mr. Lane. Each and every one of these people are here because they serve a purpose. There's no room here for non-essential personnel. There's a long line of people waiting for one of those bunks. You want to help your family, let's figure out how we stop this. It's your choice, Mr. Lane. Simple. You don't work for them anymore. - Karin... - You might not remember what this job did to you, but I do. So do not ask me to say yes to this. I have to go. They're going to kick us off the ship. What? If I go, you, the girls, Tommy, have a place to stay. If I don't, we're back in Philly tonight. What about Thierry? Can't he do anything? Men like Thierry aren't in charge of anything anymore. You keep this with you. I'll call in once a day. As long as I make that call, everything's gonna be okay. I'm coming back. Okay? We're going to make the best of it. As we do. Like we do. Okay, baby doll, Daddy's got to go to work. I'm not a baby. Okay. Tall, beautiful, tiny adult. I'll be back soon. Yeah? All right, tough guy... Take care of the ladies for me? Yeah. Deal. You're awesome. Daddy's coming back. This way, sir. Look. We don't know what we're walking into. So we do what they say. Okay. If they move, we move. If they stop, we stop. If things were to get crazy, just focus on their boots, focus on their voices, and we'll be all right. These guys are hammers. And to hammers, everything looks like nails. I heard that. You were meant to. So, you see something that's important, you call it out and we'll make it happen. Okay. You think we're gonna find anything? Yeah. Yeah, we're gonna find something. Mother Nature is a serial killer. No one's better. More creative. But like all serial killers, she can't help the urge to want to get caught. What good are all those brilliant crimes if no one takes the credit? So she leaves crumbs. Now, the hard part, why you spend a decade in school, is seeing the crumbs for the clues they are. Sometimes the thing you thought was the most brutal aspect of the virus, turns out to be the chink in its armor. And she loves disguising her weaknesses as strengths. She's a bitch. Attention. D. C. has gone dark. I repeat, D.C. has gone dark. The Capitol evacuation has been suspended. All available resources should be directed to Naval Station Norfolk. All non-essential personnel given F-6 status and in groups A through E need to report to the flight deck for relocation. Groups A and B relocating to Orlando should be on the stern clear of the landing zone. I say again, all non-essential personnel given F-6 status need to report to the flight deck. Choppers are inbound for immediate relocation. Mommy, is this dinner? Yes, sweetheart. Water here tastes funny. It's jet fuel, young lady. He's joking. I wish. Desal has trouble filtering it out. Probably because there's too many people on this ship. Everybody wake up. We're on approach to Camp Humphreys. Most of the base is dark, and no one is manning the tower. We're running on fumes, so there's really no choice, I've got to put us down. So buckle up. Hold up. Keep your finger off the trigger. Okay. Fassbach! Wait! Damn it. Move back! Friendly! Friendly! Keep it down. Keep it down. What is this? What happened to him? He slipped. He's dead. Come on! Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Okay, I'm good! - Who was it? Who fell? - Skilken. - Hold! Clear. - Hold. I want an ammo count, then you reload your mags! Yes, sir! My boy who just died out there was 23. He was 23. You want to tell me why? Because the guy who just shot himself, he's a doctor, a virologist. What are you talking about? He was supposed to be our best hope. Well, he's not our best hope anymore. Hey. That guy volunteered to come here. He didn't have to, you know. None of them did. We're still trying to figure out what the hell this thing is. Well, shit happens. The doctor would have strongly agreed with you. How do we go about refueling? When I say so. And very carefully. The noise, are they drawn to it? Yeah. Sound draws them. Body shots only seem to slow them down. Head shots do the trick, but just to be safe we tend to burn them when we can. - You fought any Zeke yet? - Yeah. - Where? - Philly. Newark. Bad? - What about Houston? - St. Louis? - Baltimore? - Atlanta? Detroit? Guys, I'll be honest with you, I don't know of any place back home that's doing very well. All right... If the other guy was a virologist, what do you do? There was a memo sent from this installation 11 days ago. It had the word "zombie" in it. Do you know anything about it? Yeah. It was an email, not a memo. Pretty obvious nobody back home bothered to read it. Now, there's 15, 16 guys in this room. Most of them guards. But all of them were bitten trying to get this man handcuffed to the cot. Now, our colonel said he was the first one. This colonel, is he around? Oh, yeah. He's right here. The guy who's shackled, do you know who bit him, what bit him? He was the base doctor. He'd just returned from the field. He'd been sent out to verify the death of a soldier who had just gone AWOL the week before. Some villagers had found this guy foaming at the mouth, oozing some kind of black tar. Then he tried to bite one of them. They shot him, tied him up, threw him in a barn. That's all we know, except the doctor comes back here and begins attacking his patients. This soldier, do you know where he came from? No. Anyone he might have come in contact with? No. There's got to be records. You are welcome to take a look if you want. Then the origin could have come from anywhere. It's a shame you had to fly all the way out here to figure that out. How did you all escape this? The expenditure of ammunition. Is that how you tweaked your leg? No, shit's been bugging me a while. This prick stands right in the mix, while seven or eight of them turn Zeke all at the same time. But they got no time for Ol' Dirty Bastard here. Biting everything like fat kids love Twix. Got no time for his lucky ass. Ain't it obvious I'm charmed? The ones I saw bitten turned in 12 seconds. Same here? Five or 10 minutes. Yeah, Davidson went and he turned in 10 minutes. "Stevie? "Captain Spekes! Oh, my God! My God! My God! Are they eating me?" Who's that? Waste no time on that freak. He's C.I.A. Got caught selling guns to North Korea. Davidson, he turned in 10 minutes. That doesn't sound viral to me at all, sports fans! You're with the C.I.A.? But they're not with me. And who are you? U.N. Oh, my God! Captain, put on the World Music! The day is saved! Why'd you sell guns to the North? Why not? Are they surviving this? Indeed they are. Using your guns. Guns are half-measures. How then? All right. They took away the Zekes' exponential power. They pulled the teeth of all 23 million in less than 24 hours. The greatest feat of social engineering in history. It's brilliant. No teeth, no bite. No great spread. Bullshit. More books, fewer receptions, Boutros Boutros. Now, why do you have to burn them to ashes to get them to finally stop? Why do they move like a plague? Why is Israel winning? How is Israel winning? They sealed off their entire country days before the undead attacked man. First to know, first to act. People have been building walls there for two millennia. Right. Yeah, but, finish all those thousands of years of work a week ago? Impeccable timing is all. You want answers? Jurgen Warmbrunn. That's the man in Jerusalem you want to see. You ever seen anything like that? Hell, no. We're going to Jerusalem. I'm your co-pilot. Oh, hang on. Hang on. Hang on a minute. Hello? Gerry? - Honey? - Gerry, can you hear me? Karin? Hello? God damn it! Give me your hand. No way. No. My mother. Dallas. Probably pacing a hole in the floor right now if she's still there. Better chance of you seeing her before me, that's all. It's a big plane. We got a lot of room. Better the devil you know than the one you don't. You'll be all right. Just pedal your ass off. Make sure Maverick here keeps the nose of that plane pointed towards the sun. Just remember, don't lock the bowser's fuel line to the inlet. Tell me 10 more times. - You good? - Right here. All right. Don't rush. We've got one chance to fuel their plane, so let's do it right. If you ain't a crack shot, don't aim for the head, just get Zeke on the ground. Remember, "Spine's divine, those knees they work just fine!" Let's go, lights out! Alpha in position. Bravo moving out. Remember, these things are drawn to sound. So I need you close to target before I bring you the truck. Now there's only one way we're getting you on that plane, and that's quietly. Shit! God damn it! Shut that thing off! Looks like we just woke the dead. Out of respect for others, please turn off all pagers and cell phones. We got to move. We've got to get out of here, let's move! Go, go, go! I'm gonna clear a path through Zeke! You pedal like hell! Come on, boys, I need head shots! Tap 'em out! I want to see some Zeke on the ground! You're kidding me. I'm a God damn Zeke. I got you, Captain. Just say the word. It's all right, boys. I got this one. - God damn it. - We got enough! We need to detach the fuel line! Israel better pay off. All right, I have instrument, but only on single prop. You'll have to talk me through it. Okay, we're clear. Okay. Give me all the lights. Switch on the anti-icing. - Where? - The red knob. - Got it, got it. - Set up our heading 020 for departure. - We got to move! - Set flaps 15 degrees. Flaps 15. All right, we are all set. Let's get out of here! Make it steep. - Gerry? - Hi, baby. Hi. Hi. I tried to call you. I know, I was... It was bad timing, I was running around. Are you okay? Yeah, even/thing's okay. I'm okay. That's the spirit. Yeah. Listen, Korea didn't work out. Now it looks like we're gonna have to go to Israel. Try to get some rest on the flight. How are the kids? I think... They're really... They're good. I got Connie right here. Baby? Attention, unidentified aircraft. You are in a restricted airspace and not clear for landing. Jerusalem tower, Reach 394. Pan, pan, pan. Request immediate landing. Contact Mossad, office of Jurgen Warmbrunn. Special Envoy, United Nations. Stay with the plane. Be ready to bug out. I'll be back before dark. The problem with most people is that they don't believe something can happen until it already has. It's not stupidity or weakness. It's just human nature. How did you know? Gerald Lane. Wrote a self-defeating Jeremiad about his employer, the U.N., back in 2010. Caused a few ripples. Sidelined your career. Thought you'd have parlayed those ripples into a self-righteous book. No nose for profit. How did Israel know? We intercepted a communique from an Indian general saying they were fighting the Rakshasha. Translation, zombies. Technically undead. Jurgen Warmbrunn. High-ranking official in the Mossad. Described as sober, efficient, not terribly imaginative. And yet you build a wall because you read a communique that mentions the word "zombie"? Well, when put like that, I'd be skeptical as well. In the '30s, Jews refused to believe they could be sent to concentration camps. In '72, we refused to fathom we'd be massacred in the Olympics. In the month before October 1973, we saw Arab troop movements, and we unanimously agreed they didn't pose a threat. Well, a month later, the Arab attack almost drove us into the sea. So we decided to make a change. A change? The Tenth Man. If nine of us look at the same information and arrive at the exact same conclusion, it's the duty of the tenth man to disagree. No matter how improbable it may seem, the tenth man has to start digging on the assumption that the other nine are wrong. And you were that tenth man. Precisely. Since everyone assumed that this talk of zombies was cover for something else, I began my investigation on the assumption that when they said "zombies," they meant zombies. Was patient zero from India? That's the problem. There's so many potential sources in play that no one knows where it began. The organ trade in Germany. Strange examples of violent behavior across the Asian peninsulas. Meanwhile, the zombie plague keeps spreading, and we do what we can. These are the Jerusalem Salvation Gates. Two of 10 portals through the security perimeter into fortified Israel. You're letting people in. Every human being we save is one less zombie to fight. It's okay. If I could get into India, where would I start? Who would I speak with? India's a black hole. Forget about patient zero. I can't do that. It's too late for me to build a wall. I'm running out of time. I need specifics. - I need answers... - I don't have answers. All you can do is find a way to hide. Get troops down there. It's too loud! It's too loud! They're coming over the top! Shit! Command, we have a breach at Salvation Gate. They're coming over the wall! Get him to Jaffa Gate. She'll get you out of here, she'll get you to your plane! Stay low! Wrong way! Wrong way! Go to landing point B. Roger, we are inbound to landing point B. Hawk 5, almost there. E.T.A. one minute. Hawk 5. Hawk 5, you're patched in. Over. This is Hawk 5. Listen carefully. The city is breached, and they're heading towards the airport. One thousand one. One thousand two. One thousand three. One thousand four. One thousand five. One thousand six. One thousand seven. One thousand eight. We got to move. You'll be all right. You're not gonna turn. You're not gonna turn! We got to move. We got to move! 5 going down. Chopper 5 is down. I say again, chopper 5 is down. L.Z. is overrun. Tower, Reach 394. Requesting immediate departure. Tower to 394. Proceed to runway four. Good luck out there. No! There! That one! Stop. Stop. Go! Go! Get them out of here! Stay calm, please. Stay calm. Come on. Go, go, go. What's your destination? I don't know. We were headed here, but I don't know. I'm Gerry, by the way. Segen. Segen. First or last? Just Segen. So, what we're doing, we've got to change this bandage and we're gonna clean it. Okay? You okay? Okay? Okay. Come on, gut up. Gut up. Here we go. We're almost there. Okay. Big breaths. Let's get this over fast. Big breaths. Here we go. Come on. Good. Last step. Last step. Big breath. Good job. There it is. Okay. Okay. Okay, I think you've earned this. Very good. Okay. You a doctor? No. I've had some training in the field. How did you know? Cutting it off... How did you know it would work? I didn't. Now I'm just a liability. This prick stands right in the mix, while seven or eight of them turn Zeke all at the same time. Is that how you tweaked your leg? No, shit's been bugging me a while. Got no time for his lucky ass. Now, the hard pan' is seeing the crumbs for the clues they are. And sometimes the thing you thought was the most brutal aspect of the virus turns out to be the chink in its armor. I don't have answers. All you can do is find a way to hide. Gerry? Are you okay? Where are you, baby? What's happening? I love you. I'm sorry. But you've got to get Thierry now. I'll find him. - Thierry! Thierry. - Excuse me. Karin. Gerry needs you. I love you. Gerry? Where are you? On the last flight out. Listen, my phone is dying and I need some quick intel. You gotta locate the closest medical research facility. A C.D.C., a W.H.O., something that makes vaccines. - And the closest airport to it. - I don't understand. No time to explain. Just make it happen, man. Okay, okay. But, Gerry, I still don't know where you are. Well, go and find out what he needs. You're gonna want to take this. Take it. Your battery is dead. We made contact with Cardiff Airport, Wales. Your people directed us. There is W.H.O. research facility nearby, but they are not sure it's still operational. This is location. Can we make it? Ladies and gentlemen, this is your Captain. I'm glad to report that we are on our final approach to Cardiff Airport in Wales. All European airports are under lockdown. But we have been given priority status and cleared for landing. We will be allowed to disembark. We are very, very lucky. Hey. Who do you belong to? What's there? What is it? You... Bags. We need trolley and bags. Mayday, mayday, mayday! Bravo 160 heavy. Emergency descent! Prepare for impact. Got to move. Come on, come on. Give me something good. Sir, Cardiff Airport lost contact with the plane. Lane is M.I.A. I'm sorry, sir. Chopper inbound for immediate relocation. I say again. All non-essential personnel given F-6 status need to report for immediate relocation. Ma'am? Thierry would like a word with you. Captain, it's only been 48 hours. He's a resourceful man. There's every chance he could have survived. Sir, I gave him my word we would look after his family. Yes, sir. I understand. Okay. Let's go. We're good. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! You're a tough bastard. And a lucky one. Who are you? I came here with a... With a woman. Is she still... Who are you? Why have you come here? Why do you keep looking at him? 'Cause he's the one in charge. You know what this place is? Of course I do. That's why I'm here. Then you understand how this must look to us. This is important to you? - How long have I been out? - Three days. Give me the phone. Just give me the phone. Give me the God damn phone! Give me the phone! As soon as you answer my question. Call it. Call the number, they'll tell you who I am. Call it. Gerry? - Yeah, I'm here. I'm here. - My God. We thought you were dead. Gerry, where are you? Thierry, I'm with a couple of nervous gentlemen. They need some bona fides before I can speak with you. Of course. This is Thierry Umutoni. Deputy Secretary-General. United Nations. To whom am I speaking? Where's Karin? Thierry, why didn't Karin answer? I'm sorry, Gerry. I did what I could. What does that mean? You've got to calm down. No, stop! Stop. You're going to hurt yourself. You're okay. His family has been sent to a refugee camp in Nova Scotia. I'm sure they'll be safe. Are you? Thierry told you who I am and what I used to do, right? Yeah. Then trust me when I tell you they're not safe. I understand how you feel. - Do you? Yes? - Yes. Do you have a family? - No. - No. Then you couldn't possibly understand, could you? I lost my son and wife in Rome. Rather, I lost my son to something that had once been my wife. We have all lost someone, Mr. Lane. In your case, there is hope at least. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Now, why did you come here? What do you need from us? Your worst disease. He wants a what? Deadly pathogen. With a high mortality rate. - But curable. - Okay, well... You'd want a bacteria rather than a virus, I would think. Typhus? Meningitis. Scarlet Fever. Rocky Mountain Fever. Anyway, excuse me, what's this for? Mr. Lane believes we can use such a disease against the undead. I would give you points for originality, Mr. Lane, if we hadn't already tried that, first thing. One of the many things a virus or bacteria needs to thrive is a live host. A functioning circulatory system. I'm afraid it boils down to one simple fact... You can't make a dead person sick. It's not for them. It's for us. I believe these things have a weakness. And that weakness is weakness. Our weakness. I have witnessed them literally bypass people. Walk right around them like a river around a rock. Why? I think, because those people were sick. I think they were terminal. And these things could sense it. I think they're spreading a pathogen, and they need a healthy host. But even if you're right, I mean, infecting the populace with a lethal illness is not exactly a cure. It's not a cure. It's camouflage. It's camouflage. There's a natural precedent. Hungry predators will avoid diseased bodies. Equipped with the right pathogen, our troops would be essentially invisible to the enemy. You understand the only way to prove this theory of yours is for some idiot to infect themselves with a lethal pathogen and then... ...meet with her, face to face. Yes. Do we have what we need to try it? We have all he could want. Typhus, H1N1, SARS. The problem is, they're all stored in B-Wing. What's the matter with B-Wing? Dr. Spellman. Our chief vaccinologist. Within hours of the outbreak, he'd been sent blood samples to try and isolate the pathogenic cause. Unfortunately... This is B-Wing now. God damn it. How many? How many are there? There were 80 people working there. I've never seen them move like that. They're dormant. They're awaiting stimulus. Now, this is vault 139. That's where your samples would be. This is the skybridge. That connects B-Wing to the main building here. And this, is the only thing standing between us and the skybridge. So, what do you propose, Mr. Lane? You are not serious. B - Wing's a maze. They'll never make it back alone. We don't even know if his theory is correct. Well, I know I'm not asking one of you to take him there. Each has its merits. - Last resort. - It's too loud. Let's go. Try not to kill one. It only makes the rest of them more aggressive. Yeah. You sure you want to do this? Of course I'm not. Let's go. Good luck. See you all shortly. Good luck. If anything comes down this hall before we do, you seal these doors for good. - Understood? - Okay. There they are. Go, go. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. Come on! They're fine. They're fine. Shit. The vault we need is in 139. Go! Oh, my God. Left, left, left! What are you doing? She'll get you to the vault. That's the vault. - We can make it. - No, we can't. We can't make it. Let's go! They're not gonna make it. You heard what Javi said, we cannot open it. They're not alone, we can't open it! They are coming back! We can't leave them there. Come on! Open the door! - Run! - Run! Run! Faster, come on! Run! In, in, in! Come on! Now where is Gerry? Where is he, where is he, where is he? Come on, come on, where are you? 5-6-9-6-4. 5-6-9-6-4. What happened to Gerry? Not that one. Not that one. Oh, shit! Shit! Jesus. He's going to inject himself. We have no idea which one's going to work. We don't know if any of them will work. If he uses anything he took from that left case, he's dead anyway. What's he doing? How long does he have to wait? Before he's infected? Not long, but, that's not the question we're really asking, is it? Look at them. He just walked right past him! He walked right past him! Like it was nobody! Okay. This isn't the end. Not even close. Hi, there. This is... This is Amy. Is anyone out there? Hello. I'm trying to get in contact with anyone. We've had some luck finding people with this transmission. We've lost entire cities. When there's no more people left to infect, they go dormant. Whole cities are lost. The World Health Organization reports today that help may soon... ...a hybridized meningitis strain with components of smallpox and H1N1. We still don't know how it started. The World Health Organization has created a vaccine that works as a kind of camouflage, making people who receive it invisible to the infected. We bought ourselves some time. Volunteer forces are delivering the vaccine to areas that have been cordoned off. Distribution efforts began in earnest on April 10th... The importance of getting the information out to those still alive within the quarantine... But it's given us a chance. If you can get to a colder area, to higher ground, they move slower on the ground. The Battle of Moscow is still raging. Initial tests on the so-called camouflage have been largely successful. Others have found a way to push back. Move, move! All right, juice 'em up! Approaching target. Permission to engage. Permission granted. All clear. Light 'em up. Light 'em up. It's permanent! It's settled, it's settled! It's over with! There's no forgiveness in hell! Whatever goes to hell, stays in hell! This is Station 7 in Nebraska, broadcasting on the shortwave band. If you can fight, fight. Head north if you can. Hello? Is there anyone out there hearing this? Help each other. Mexico City has been declared a complete loss. Be prepared for anything. Our war has just begun.
