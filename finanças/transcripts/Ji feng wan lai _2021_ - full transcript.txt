Hello, Ms. Wang So sorry, I'm late It's raining outside Yes, it is Couldn't get a cab. Would you like to add anything? No, we're fine So here are some of the overseas trips our company offers Brazil Argentina and Mexico Here have a look We also offer Germany Britain and Italy Please, have a look Mr. Liu The current economic environment has changed For a company this size It's very hard to run large tours As for domestic tours the demands are low which means, profits are low But Ms. Wang√ø Even if you do manage to make bookings In a year or two There will be more problems With rising salaries and cost Eating into your capital How are you going to cope? That's why I have to tell you Unfortunately Your offer is unrealistic And we can't accept this deal Regarding the scale of the company I can't argue with that I started it myself from scratch But to be frank If my company was doing well I would've listed it on the stock market To be honest Taking over my company is also good for your business For instance our Communist History tours I'm not kidding I've been doing it for over 8 years Chongqing Yan an Xibaipo We cover them all You might have heard Many local companies, schools and government offices It's mandatory for them to attend If you take over you will be making money I'm going to be honest with you I'm actually thinking about retiring If you take over, it'll be a win win situation Mr. Liu Do you believe in The Book of Changes? My master, he studies it The I Ching He says he can see the future and that everything is connected to a single source of energy What is yours, will be yours What is meant to happen, will happen However, for ordinary folks like us we won't know But for some They can sense it Isn't it interesting? Mr. Liu Take some time to consider You have my number Let's keep in touch Sure, sure Hello Is he one of ours? Damn it What rotten luck What happened? I don't know What do you know? Someone saw him sleeping in the car Nothing weird This morning they tried to wake him and found that he wasn't breathing normally What did the doctor say? The doctor said He's brain dead Other than that, I didn't understand anything else Did you ask the other drivers? They all don't know him What about his family? They are all here But I don't know what to tell them Damn it! Do you know anything? Boss Has this happened before? You got it wrong again Your dad should be back soon I'll drive you home I'm leaving Money's in my bag Do this again Focus Take out the trash please Mum's rental contract is almost up She's considering buying a place instead What was that? Nothing What have you been doing everyday? Still unemployed? I don't get it Spent a fortune studying abroad and you still can't find a job?

These people are crazy No shit they're crazy They're peasants You need to sort this out Learn how to deal with it You can't call me every time You're the boss Here, have a cigarette No thanks I'm working on it He just started working for me I haven't even met him and now, it's chaos Don't tell me tell a lawyer Have you found one? Yes, I have He's sorting it out Then tell him to handle it This isn't anything out of the ordinary The trouble starts later You better be prepared Just pay her the money It'll be less hassle doing that Think of it as bad luck It's just bad luck Are you free on Monday? Why? One of my student's parents told me they are hiring I've arranged an interview for you It's a top firm The salary is good You have good qualifications Why don't you try harder? Wear this to the interview Leave a good impression Eat They are not going to hire me You don't need to worry I've already laid the ground works It should be fine We'll see By the way I went to dad's company He is in trouble A driver was found passed out Don't forget, Monday Don't forget The person that's in there now is taking a while That's a good sign Last time, I saw a person come out in two minutes Two minutes? It goes to show, just having a degree is useless Unless you have work experience or your family has connections They allocate you in different departments? If the interviewer graduated from an Ivy League College he'll favour Ivy League graduates How many interviews have you been to? Me? I've just started looking Commerce degree? Sort of Which college? It's not a good one Please come with me Did you guys read up on job interview skills? It teaches you how to dress and act That stuff is useless Your CV is the most important thing Sorry to interrupt where is the bathroom? Thanks. Please continue It all depends on the culture of the firm too Announcement: Please use the back door to alight from the bus How did it go? It's been a long day I need a drink It's not looking good Have a smoke It's complicated I went to the hospital They diagnosed what was wrong He suffered a severe brain hemorrhage He is brain dead The machine is keeping him alive So how much compensation do I need to pay? It's complicated It's difficult to judge The peasants arrived when I was there They brought the whole village to the hospital all demanding something How well did you know the driver? It turns out he married many wives He's not a regular guy He's got kids in the country and another family in Shanghai What? Before he was married he had a child with someone else Now they are all here That's why you have to compensate all of them What do you mean? Calm down That's why I'm here I'm just explaining the situation The most crucial thing is time As long as he's alive we can negotiate Maybe we can lower the amount If he dies, then it's all over You have to pay They could ask you for two million Two million dollars? Why don't they just go rob a banks? What else can you do? In their eyes, you're from the city So you've got money They think you owe them They won't stop harrassing you until they get what they want Brain hemmorhage I looked into it It doesn't count as a work hazard At least we can cover some through insurance You need to give me his contract and health insurance details Also, who recommended him? Must be another driver Find me that guy I need to speak to him He may have to testify for you Okay? Okay One last thing to remember don't go to the hospital If you go, they'll hassle you it'll be hard to negotiate. OK? If they come to your office again call the police Call the police? Wouldn't that make it worse? Don't be scared Tell the police you have a heart condition Let them handle the peasants Since you're clear with everything, I'm leaving Okay? Get those things I asked for as soon as you can Got it? Got it Bring everything to my office. You know where it is Okay Mr. Zhou, wait have a smoke No, thank you Come on, take one Go and find them Alright Thank you Goodbye Thank you again Hello? Anyone here? Anyone here? How can you be so careless? How can you not have a working contract with him? What can I do now? I don't know If you had insurance I could use it to lessen the damage But you have nothing If this was a car accident You would be soley responsible. Do you understand? What about the witness? The driver that recommended him. You can't find him? Hey I don't know where he went I'm asking everyone that knows him That's it Forget it Forget what I said He probably skipped town Which leaves us with nothing The doctor did say overworking Could be one of the causes Now we don't have a witness But hey He had only been working for three days How can he be overworked? Under normal circumstances, you're right But since you have no witness and no contract, they can say whatever High blood pressure, diabetes Hell, they can claim anything What can you do? Two million dollars is unrealistic That won't happen I'll try my best to cut it down to under 1.5 million dollars That I can do Maybe I can negotiate an even lower number The lesser the better Right? But remember, He's got a lot of family members It's not going to be easy with that many mouths to feed Be prepared Dad Dad Your phone Turn on the light please Exams? Revision class What's up? Nothing much I was nearby I have something to ask you I'm listening You know My company is not doing well lately You know that savings account Can I please borrow it for now? I'll pay it back as soon as things get back on track Your company is doing that poorly? Not possible The money is for Yi Fan I'm not spending your money I just need to borrow it to cover some things for now I know what happened Your worker had an accident? Now, they're asking you to pay compensation? Isn't it funny that all these years and your company is still not making money? Maybe you should close it Tao Qing! Oscar controls the ball He crosses the far post Header! He hits the bar It's a goal kick Ref points the goal That was a header at the far post Just a little over It's a grueling game It's one of the reasons Liar! He was fine before Now he's lying unconscious Not moving What did you do to him? We know Mr. Luo had high blood pressure How could you not know? High blood pressure my ass! Look at these poor children The driver that recommended Mr. Luo can testify Bring him here! Bring him here! He's not here at the moment I'm here to talk to you My husband was never sick until you people came along We ask for this We never wished for this So it's our fault then? Say that to my children How dare you offer us $20,000? We are with Mr. Luo Enough of you! Where's your boss? Bring him here You scum The boss is not here We are all on the same side Come on tell him You people are heartless Trying to insult me with this money You think we're peasants? HOW DARE YOU My kids are young We understand We are very sorry about Mr. Luo but JUST GIVE US AN ANSWER You can't threaten us Why don't you die instead of him! You're his lawyer Why don't you go kill yourself If we have to, we'll go to court I just want to talk this out with you and your family Mrs. Luo Either you return my husband or give me the money Not what you've offered, this is a joke It's 10pm. Let's call it a day If the adults don't need rest, the children do We'll continue this tomorrow. Okay? Tomorrow then Goodbye Tomorrow Hold on to it for now See you tomorrow You guys, just don't get it That's a lot of money What else do you want? A smart person would've taken the money gone home and started over You could buy a house in the village Be settled for life If it was me, I would be over the moon Mr. Liu You're a hard man to find Care to visit your employee at the hospital? Regarding that please talk to my lawyer He is handling this Please talk to him okay? I'm asking you how much you're willing to pay Give me a number We are going to compensate I really can't give you a number It's not up to me or you as a matter of fact It's up to the law Mr. Liu Let's cut the bullshit He is lying there kept alive by a machine You know what He's not going anywhere I'll tell you this We are leaving tomorrow Without us, the hospital can't cut the life support He's all yours You can keep him there or take him home with you Mr. Liu I knew you would come find me I'll put them here Mr. Liu Everything is written in the energy People have intercepted them in the past Interpreting the information For instance Jesus is from the west Buddha even Einstein Only the chosen can read it When someone dies, their spirit turns into energy and it returns to the universe When you're alive If you're righteous your energy will be high That's what Buddha tries to teach us It's the same reason It's done. Let's go Sorry, I'm late Let's go What did you have for lunch? Left overs Mr. Shen said he can't sell the car Nobody wants it I was thinking, if it's okay I can use it Suit yourself Who's car is that? Are you selling the car?

I think she is So I thought, let's just stare at each other We just stood there like idiots At least you can find phones Your Karma is bad Shut up man Speaking about that I do have something to say I told you I'm leaving next month I'm leaving here And now that I have to leave for good it's making me angry talking about it Then don't bring it up You got everyone curious now I can tell you this It's because of my sister She worked hard, saved up some money, rented a store to start a business If business is bad, she could rent the store out Right? Sounds like a plan She just got the place, and now they want to demolish it They claim it's an illegal property Can you believe this shit? It's obvious They let you in when they need you When the city is overpopulated, they tell you to leave It's easy for you to say You know Stop People like you Grown up in the cities A new generation of Shanghainese This doesn't bother you I'm not really Shanghainese He's a Shanghainese You're still better off than us Boss, where's my food?

Nothing really I had a fight with someone I didn't realise how political it can get in the army, it's all about That's why I left and started driving What about you? Why are you, a local Shanghainese, working as a driver? It's a long story There were some issues at home So I had to start making some money You don't have any siblings? I have an older brother Each person has their own problems I grew up in a small village We didn't have much I had to work for everything I won't let people look down on me So I worked hard I was the top of my class But the army changed me You know Thanks. See you You look tanned A little I can smell cigarette smoke on you Probably because a friend was smoking nearby Do you still want to continue studying? You can't keep going like this Studying abroad will be good for you I don't know Stop staying with your dad. It won't do you any good If you don't want to go to America You can study in another country I've saved up some money for you How much could you have saved? Enough for you Enough for you to study abroad You were saving up this whole time? Does dad know? Of course he does Did he come to you to borrow money? He did He came to my school As if I care What do you mean by that? Excuse me? If you had the money, why didn't you help him? Why should I? Why should I? So he doesn't have to sell his company, maybe So we don't have to go through this Why did you refuse? That was my choice I'll tell you why. It's because he deserves what he got Even if he begs, I won't lend him a penny The money is for you For me I only care about you Just me? Yeah, right You said the money is for me right? Then give it to me Why? So you can give it to your dad? How I use it, is my business What don't you understand? Your dad will never change With him, there's always something He's always a victim If I lend him the money this time, what then? I guarantee you, things will be the same Just like before right? I don't get you, always looking back at the past Why did you have me then? Let's go What's wrong? A few days ago, she told me Her classmates are talking about us She is a bit upset What's your plan then? We need to reconsider our relationship She's my daughter If we continue, it's not good for her and it'll become a mess You think I'm a mess? I didn't mean what I said before She's my daughter I care about her I know What are we then? I want to send her to Canada I've been planning this for a while But not now If you are willing to when the time is right, we all go together When is the right time? When can I start over?

Get lost That was a Jack Two You got me You really got me What's up? Are you still pretending? What the fuck? You're asking me what I'm talking about? You're still pretending you don't know?

Know what? You knew he was going to die Why did you pay? He planned to scam us Say something Say something Say what? What did the lawyer say? Why can't we sue them? We need to get our money back Are you simple? You think I didn't ask already? What can the lawyer do? Even if he was about to die and the law says he can't work How can we prove that he was about to die? Even if we can prove it Do you think these peasants care about the law? Forget about it. What's done is done How can you just forget about it? What then? Ask for it back? Track them down and get it back? Based on what evidence? Even if we have evidence, we'll still lose Alright Alright Alright what? You don't think I'm stress enough already? Mum was right You never change Is this your first time here? Do you want to dance? Let's dance You're already here Why not dance? Just relax, we're only dancing You're good That's 20 bucks Come on, pay up The wind is strong All the trains are affected this afternoon Many tourists are trapped here. They are slowly evacuating people As you can see, the staff are shutting the gates It's one of the biggest typhoon we've seen in years The whole city is working together to prevent accidents Many residents are advised to stay home I saw it strike there What happened to the typhoon? It was on the news What was that about? It's coming tonight Where's the lightning I'm leaving, let's go It's a hoax The typhoon's not going to come, let's go The rain stopped Yes? I'm looking for Zuo He's not here What do you want? I have something for him You can come in and wait if you want He should be back soon Are they going to demolish this building soon? Yes, they've been saying that for a long time But they haven't done anything It won't be for a while I think If they knock it down, you can move to a bigger place We don't own this, we're renting If they knock it down, we have to move even further away It's better if we stay Where are you from? Shanghai Today your day off? Yeah It's good to take a break occasionally Zuo never takes a break I tell him to take some time off but he doesn't listen I always tell him to look after himself, he never listens He's the breadwinner, he needs to earn money He's use to it He use to drive in the army too It's probably better to be in the army than driving a cab You need to have connections and networks to do well in life. Even in the army He had a fight with someone in the army because of that, he had to leave It must be hard on Zuo after what happened to his dad Yes, it was Nobody expected it One day he was fine and the next he's gone Just like that He wasn't sick back then? He was very healthy Just some minor illnesses I told him to see a doctor He never went and now√ø It's too late now Please give this to Zuo What the fuck do you want? Nothing She didn't know so I wanted to tell her the truth Did you read it? He was dying but you didn't know How can a son not know his father is dying? I went to the hospital Your dad refused all treatment For me, my life is more important than money Maybe it isn't so for you guys I understand. I really do With so many mouths to feed He had to find a way to leave something behind for you animals Does it feel good to spend blood money? I would, I would feel good Money is money, right? Money makes people happy Right? Go on Hit me. Don't stop. Go on Useless Isn't it? He's dead When you're dead, nothing matters anymore What are you doing here? How did he die?

You fucking animal You want to hit me? How dare you hit me Where do you get the nerve? You're a bastard, and now you're asking me these questions You fucking animal You shameless animal, fuck off Fucking animal You think you're better than us? Long time I found someone Someone wants to buy your car What do you say? You can think about it Fuck it Sell it to him Got it Thanks Did you hear One of the drivers got into a whole heap of trouble What happened? All I heard was The police arrested him I've got to go Good luck, young man Bye He's not here Come in I'm leaving Before I go I wanted to see him You should tell him to leave you Start fresh, live a more structured life He should go with you He won't want to He won't go with anyone He's an adult Why don't you wait? He'll be back soon
