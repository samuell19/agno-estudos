Zenek! Ze-nek!Ze-nek! Shame you don't know Dad's song. - I'm sorry... - Come on! Put your hands up, Daniel! - Hold the wheel. - I am, stop nagging. The President is already here. And the local VIPs. - Can I keep that puppy? - Fix me a warm- up drink, Danka. Dad! Can I? - I don't mind. - But Mom does. - Please talk to her. - After the concert - You'll forget. - No, I won't. You hear that? 70 thousand people. Ostróda. This is my moment. Exactly. A moment. Life is made of moments... Thanks. Like butterflies... Zenek, champ! Ze-nek!Ze-nek! Good evening, Ostróda! How are you tonight? All hands up! High Hp to the sky! You have the camera rolling? What was your question again? You had an intuition... That's right. When things are going too well, you can't help thinking that it won't last forever. Zenek's success was well deserved. More than 20 years of his hard work. He's over there. - You watch it! - Come on, guys! Wow!! I'd get this one. Look at her tits! Show me! Uh- huh. Show me! I like Sandra better. 'She sucks. Are you into brunettes? - With a great voice. - Screw her voice. How much is this? 1800. Clear sound, no noise. - Are lyrics included? - No. Just the titles. Why, you understand English? - Hey, don't make a mess here. - Just looking. Wow! A Limahl poster! From that music video. - Remember? - Yeah. How much is “Bravo”? You can't afford it. Grab it and let's beat it. No. Oh, my! What's on this one? Be careful, they scratch easily. Sorry, I didn't know. Some more over there. Bye. Bye. Come on, let's go! Damn gypsies pinched a magazine! Leave the bikes here. Hi. So what do I play to cheer you up? “Androverda", Don Vasyl! - Can you sing in our language? - Sure thing! All right! Picking our girl? It seems they hit that warehouse with tape recorders again. Your loving brother would steal anything for you. I don't tell him to do it. We have tape recorders in the trunk, help yourselves. This one's for you, uncle. To play music in the tent. I want nothing from you! What's that gadjo doing here? Get out of here. Rush back home. - You and your Russian buddy. - They're about to leave. Take your goodies and go. And keep your mouth shut. Or you might swallow a fly! Let me pass. Come on, I'll see you off. Uncle! Zenek! Holy cow! What are you doing here? I wanted to say hello. Hi. And play the guitar, huh? No, why... Well... It needs a tune- up. How's everything? - Well... How's your mom? - Fine, thank you. - Dad? - Not bad, thanks. How long are you here for? A few days. I don't know. Take me to your concert I'd give you two cassettes. Alphaville and Asha. A-ha. A-ha. It's up to your mom. - Yeah, I know that. - She doesn't want you to waste time playing like your dad and I. Could you ask her? - Boys... - Wait! How long to the top? What about your math? Come on, let them hear this through. Could I take Zenek to the concert next Saturday? If he gets an A in math, huh? He needs to study. And to get enough sleep before the Sunday mass. So he won't look like a ghost. - We won't be late, right? - Sure thing. Absolutely? How's everybody?! Bravo! Want to meet my nephew Zenek? Zenek! Can you sing for us? Zenek! Zenek! Bravo! - “Summer Dreams", you know it? - Yes. Go ahead. Good evening. Someday he'll be famous. The shack is mine! Bravo! Thanks a lot! See? They already love you. Music is certainly worth living for! Thank you very much! Zenek! Hurry up or you'll be late. Oh. my gosh! - Ready? - You bet! For once no need to drag you to the mass. - What's this? - Kazik lent me. You can't go in a red shin. It's the latest style. Sis! Do you like it? Grandma will make me one from diapers. Don't be silly. - Come on, we'll be late. - Call Father. Dad! Where to? Zenek Martyniuk. Did you like it, Mom? It was beautiful. Excuse me, folks. My name's Skarysiuk. It's about Zenek. He sings very well. Well? He sings beautifully. My son's wedding's in a week. Perhaps Zenek could... I'd really appreciate it. Do you sing songs to dance to? Like what? Popular hits. To get them dancing. What do you say, Mom? Thank you. So we have a deal. Look out! Rysiek! We'll give a concert At Skarysiuk's wedding next week. Holy shit! Hi, Sylwia. I heard you sing. Very nice. I can sing for you tonight, if you like. - Just for me? - Yeah. Come on, you're heading home. - We haven't even begun. - It's okay. Less fuss. Home, I said. Fucking prick. - Cheer up, we're playing! - Playing what? Give me a smoke and I'll tell you. - We don't have any instrument, do we? - Kazik mentioned a keyboard. Your uncle will lend us his. Maybe. I don't know. We'll split the money with him. We're getting paid with booze. Booze? Damn! - Uncle won't mind. - What kind of deal is that? - We're playing, that's important. - But how? Okay, never mind. I'll take care of it. - Can we? - Yeah, sure. - Come on, let's go. - Where? To get instruments. Kazik! By the way... We need some rubbers for Zenek. - He has a date with Sylwia. - Shut up! Come on, you clowns! Wait! How about some blood sausage? We'll never finish... Make a pause. - In half an hour, Mom! - Don't raise your voice. I'd eat it right now! Come get some. Go on writing! Stop and write down. Stop! And write. Walec died in a motorbike accident yesterday. - You don't say! - Nothing left of him. Crashed into a tractor. The funeral is on Friday. You coming? Not sure, maybe. Go on. How about a duet for “Hurray”? All right! Sausage break? Run. Mr. Skarysiuk! What about our deal? A hit, isn't it? Come along. Thanks a lot! Thank you. Hi, Zenek. Hi. I've got a beer for you. Fancy bottle. From Germany. Cool. They say that beer is good for your hair. Yeah, I heard that too. Oh, my gosh... I have kissed George Michael. I've got to go. See that? He's good. If they keep paying like this, we're doomed. Sorry. The guy must be so wasted that his horse took charge. Shit! Watch out. Take your time. I need to go home. You're bombed out of your skull. Let's go to my place. Your mother shouldn't see you now. The bikes. What are you up to, dummies? - He drank too much, first time ever. - Under my tree? Yours? See the “Y" for Yari? Well, yes. So get the fuck out of here. Let's go, Zenek. Where to? - You said we must... - And you're fucking obedient! I think we could use you for a job. Couldn't we, Mute? How? You'll keep an eye out. Any problem, dickhead? - No. - Then don't stare like that. Get the fuck out! And you agreed? We had no choice. You too? I couldn't leave a friend. Do what you want, I'm nobody's fool. A heist with Yari -that's crazy! It's a shame Walec is dead. I'll be too scared to ride. Why? It's enough to use caution. Shh... Have a look. His girlfriend. - Not bad, isn't she? - I don't know. Have you seen her tits? Come on! We're at a funeral. That low- cut dress is on purpose. Rysiek! I'll be right there. Are you guys coming in? You hear better outside. How do I look? Like a dick on a cake. What's so funny? We'll try to get in at the rear. You two go to the front. - What for? - To watch out for suspicious visitors. I got it. - What if I see a car approaching? - Holler “Yari, cops are coming!" We could have taken smarter ones. You're right. No go. Let's use the front door. What the heck? He said “at the rear." - What's up, Yari? The front after all? - Shut up, asshole! Look. A sex party right here! Just like my old folks! - Holy shit! - Shhh... Put this down. You too. Put your hands up! Late night shopping? Don't jerk me. See this club? Let's go. Oh, my God... Oh, my God... Good morning! Where's Kazik? Ask his mother. Hello. How are you, Zenek? Kazik skipped school today. Is he sick? No. He left for the mountains where his father's relatives live. Oh. When's he coming back? Not until things have smoothed out. What about school? He'll continue in the new place. I don't want him going downhill like those two. What's his future here? Keeping watch while Yari robs a bank? We didn't want to be there. I know. I know you enjoy our singing. And you speak our language. But you belong elsewhere. So does Kazik. Can you wait a moment? Kazik left something for you. For your concerts, he said. You know that you're like a son to me. If you ever need help, I'm there for you. Remember that, okay? You'd better go now. You'll get to see him again, don't worry. Shit! It's jammed. All right, done. Let's see if we can open it. You want to come inside? Kazik never came back. Perhaps his mother didn't let him. Or he didn't want to himself. He lives in Canada. Yari was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Mainly for a fight in which someone died. They say that he was threatening to get back at Kazik and Zenek. But as time went on, everybody forgot. Watch your step! So this is where it all began. Come along. We played more and more, better and better. The stage... Until it became a roller coaster ride. Look at this. Zenek. It's going to be a flashy show. Rehearsal's over! She's good, isn't she? - Who? - The singer. She has a great voice. Like the one from Top Twenty. It's a guy. Zenek Martyniuk. He'd be mad at you for what you said. Holy cow! A guy with this voice... Like Michael Jackson. He's my nephew. He lives nearby. Sings at all wedding parties. Never heard of him? No. Several gigs per weekend. Well... I happen to be a manager. And I'm a musician. Singer. I'd take him on. One singer is a drunk, unreliable. He could fill in. Will he say yes? Oops! A week's work could go down the drain. Again? I don't have enough customers - to drink it. - Just this last time. We're turning professional. All right, give me this shit. Got more? Holy cow! - How about a gig over here? - You do concerts? Better than your shit. I play quality music. Joy Division, Led Zeppelin. - AC/DC. Ring a bell? - Aah... Heavy stuff, isn't it? - It's not always about fun. - Hell, I sing to cheer people up! After the daily grind in the field they sit glued to the TV. Let them enjoy Friday nights - dance, sing... Unwind. Perhaps. How much for this? Come to our concert, we'll get your ass dancing! Maybe sometime. As usual? Keep it safe. And a bonus. Good morning! Holy shit, we'll rich! Hey! Come on! I don't hit women. At least give us some eggs! Mommy! If you need something, come here. You'll help me with the rollers. Mom... If I told you I got an offer from a professional band, what would you say? Theoretically. Myself and Rysiek... Theoretically, what did his mother say? Well... Let's assume she almost agreed. Same here. Theoretically yes, 'cause you sing so well. Practically no, 'cause you have 3 tests next week. What's so funny? Don't laugh, say something. Hey, we're not done with the rollers! Turn it off! Dad has promised to talk to her. What about yours? Wait! Something for you, listen. Did you hear? Hang on! Am Ito sit here like a dummy until they're done? Rysiek! Whoa! Stop! Stand still! All right. Giddyup! Let me take a drag. - How long do you think it'll last? - Well into the night. I hope Mom will already be asleep. They don't need to know how we came. Okay, it'll do. Whoa! All right, all right. Zenek, dammit! - People are waiting! - Give us a hand! Come on! Looking good! It's for you. Thank you. I'll do it. No, thanks. Come along, Sylwia. Shit! - Zenek, what the heck? - Just a second! What's the matter? Nothing! All together now! Thank you very much! I'll get some soda. The next song is “Walkman Love... What's your drink, sweetie? What's it to you? Screw you! Orange soda, please. You like musicians? That's none of your business. Watch out, this one is mine. I don't know him. Lucky you. I'd have to scalp you. You guys did very well! Are you free next Friday? There's a 3- day fest. I can get you a guitarist and a drummer, huh? Zenek! - How about next weekend? - Whereabouts? Kleszczele. All right, let's do it. Do you like her? Why? You can get diaper cloth. Or sunglasses. Now get a pair of wings! Excuse me. Can you break it for me? They're shooting. A war! Cotton candy! Let's get some. Let me have another try. I'd like a teddy bear. Hi. Three large ones, please. I like it small. Not to mess up my hair. See the one in a pink jacket? By the cotton candy. Her name is Danka. She's in a nursing school with my sister. Don't look their way, like we want something. Hot in the pants at long last? Yeah. I like her. Out of your league, my friend. Rich parents, home discipline. - Don't fantasize. - I'm not. I will marry her. Watch me. I dedicate my next song to the pretty brunette in a pink jacket! Is everybody having fun? Zenek fell in love! Put your hands up! Thank you, Kleszczele! Can I have this dance? Yes, you can. Did you like my song for you? Maybe. Your name is Danka, isn't it? Maybe yes, maybe no. I love the smell of your hair. Cotton candy? More like green apple. My name is Zenek. I didn't introduce myself. I know. You sing well. I bet you hear that from many girls. Zenek! Who's that? Some gypsy. Let's move on. You don't remember? Or you're pretending not to? Come on. Nine trains run down this track daily. That way. So many? Yeah. And only three return. What about the remainder? It's a puzzle. They take a different route or continue along the same? Yeah, on and on: Russia, Siberia... Or they get stuck there for good, - hundreds of them. - I'm leaving in a couple of days. - No kidding. - An internship at a hospital in Warsaw. For a month or more. But I've only just met you. Can't you stay? - Hey, dude, leaving already? - Wait a minute. You pick up pussies with your pansy tunes? Just give us a break. Come on. What's going on? Come on! Get in. We're out of here! You don't like our songs? It's fucking shit. But why? Well, in that case... - Where's Rysiek? - I don't know. Come on! Wait! Hey, there! Watch me! Get in! Get the fuck out of here! Fucking hicks! We're playing tomorrow. Will you come? What's this racket? I want you back home, Danka! But... Dad! No buts! You too! The name Danka confirmed. I'll be back tomorrow! What's the matter with you? Come on, guys! The Remix dropped out. There's only you against Baby Dance. Those who play longer time win! Come on, guys! Take it easy. You want to win or not? - We've played some forty songs. - Then play fifty. Those are on their last legs. And the public love you. In an hour and a half I'm seeing off Danka. Then sing faster. The 1988 Song Marathon winner is... The Accent! Get ready for their good-bye song! “Paper Moon... Are you having a good time? It's great playing for you again. Put your hands up! He may still make it. Yeah, sure. Six minutes left. Asshole. At the keyboard - Rysiek! The guitar - Dariusz! The drums - Mariusz! And the vocals by me - Zenek. Thank you very much. All together now! He wants your number. Call me! How? How do I call? Excuse me. Flowers for me? Strangers again, huh? Why? A girl catches your eye and a memory lapse strikes? There's nothing to remember. Zenek! Leave me alone, okay? And stop following me. I'm tired. Try now! All right! Excuse me! Zenek? Hi. I took Rysiek's motorbike. Danka went to Warsaw, found a job. My wife and I were happy with that. Because Zenek wasn't exactly our choice. A musician... What can you expect? From one gig to another, doing who knows what. But apparently she missed him - came back to stay with him for good. As we opposed their marriage, they decided that a baby would do the trick. She confessed that years later. They tried for several months, succeeded and got married in the end. Little fun did she have with him. It showed right away what it means to marry a musician. What do you think? You have this style, what's the point? For the stage. Can't wear one pair. Could you help me with these? Stop it. Don't. Shit! Gotcha! I've been looking for you. - We should be on our way. - What? - Where to? - We have a concert - At 7. - Two hours to get there. No way. I'm not ready. I need a hair spray. You have shoes, I have your shin, we'll get you that spray. Come on! - See you. - Bye. Go. Bye. Bye. Where can I get a hair spray? Thanks. - It's his basic must- have. - These would make a nice fur coat. Don't touch my mom's rabbits! Better find yourself a bunny girl. Your hair sprays, dandy! Thanks, bunny boy. Hi. - How much is one? - 900. I recommend this brand. Hi. The Accent, ring a bell? - Sure. Sold out. - What do you mean? I'll have more when recorded. - We haven't recorded anything. - Someone did, at the concerts. - Holy cow! Hear that? - What? - They record our concerts. - What? When will you have it? In a few days. The boss got us 200 cassette decks, soundproofed the room with egg canons, things are in full swing. No shit! We'll be back then. Bye. My cassette! They record our concerts! Zenek! Zenek! Hi! Gee, a crowd like it's Limahl. - There's not enough room. - We'd squeeze in. - Tomorrow we'll be in Sczyty. - Am Ito follow you around? What can I do with these busloads of people... No, I won't have that. Enjoying n? Great. We'll now play for you a song titled “Karma Chameleon"! We invite you very warmly! ???? Come on! Dad. Dad! It's begun. I knew it. Where's Zenek? Thank you so much! Zenek! Zenek! OK. Stop! Here you go. I need to go back home. Why are you staring, I'm pregnant. And in labor. - Let's go to the hospital. - I'll grab my bag. - How will you get there? - I have Rysiek's motorbike. Just perfect for a woman in labor. Take my car. I just wonder if you're ready. I've driven your car before. Ready for a baby. You'll have a family. Give me the car keys, Dad. Zenek! Zenek! You have a son. Danka gave birth. For Danka and Daniel... Zenek would go under the knife. When Daniel was born, Zenek was eager to take care of him. He even washed diapers. But he couldn't live without singing. Stayed 2 weeks with the baby, then back to the concert routine. They needed the money. We'd be away for weeks. But he'd always bring back large bags of presents for his boy. He was spoiling the kid, like some Santa of all seasons. We used to make fun of Zenek. Once Daniel asked over the phone: Dad, when will you bring me dear presents? But Danka had little fun. People would say that she was like a single mother. After a few years Zenek bought their first apartment. That sweetened the pill a bit... But then people started to gossip how rich she became, how uppity. Daddy! Daddy! Hi, honey! That's how it was those days. I missed you like crazy. See you in an hour! Did Mom behave well? What's in an hour? We have a concert in Ogrodniki. Want to come? How about dinner with us? With you. We could go out after the concert Perhaps. Kowalczyk! Kowalczyk scores! 1:0 for Poland! Do you know this one? Helen, you speak slowly, you write slowly, think slowly. Is there anything you do quickly? "Yes, boss. I get tired quickly". Find yourself a girlfriend. Hi, folks. Change this shit, okay? - And what instead? - It goes without saying. Yeah! - I don't have it. - No shit! - What do you have? - Beer. - Okay, get me one. - Now you're talking. Give me a break! You're a pest. Look who's here! Zenek and company. - No wonder this shit is on. - Fuck off. - What did you say? - Fuck off. Zenek, tell him where to get off or he'll be in trouble. Please show respect for my wife. She's your wife? Not he? She's on top, he lies down. Hey, guys! Wanna fight, get outside! Just a moment. Watch out. So? You fucking beat it. You beat it, huh? Let's go, Danka. Before you go, tell the guy to change the music. What the fuck? Rysiek! Bye-bye, faggots. Not everybody was fond of Zenek's music. Adversaries and fans, that's normal. Female fans. Over there. That window. The minute we drove up to the club all hell broke loose. They'd scream as if he was some di Caprio. Ze-nek!Ze-nek!Ze-nek! He could've had them all. But he wasn't interested. Luckily Rysiek was always around, so the potential wasn't wasted. Regular “disco polo." Do you know that it was Zenek who came up with this term? For Polish disco music. A guy from the radio contacted us and Zenek recorded a cassette with him. Unfortunately without a contract. Things were like that in those days. Anybody could record, copy and sell. The mafia controlled this business, but we weren't aware of that. So it was quite a success, but without a due payoff. Danka and Zenek had a small apartment. But he promised to buy her a house. For him to afford it they went to Belgium for a few years. The money from concerts wasn't much, so they did odd jobs like fruit picking. But it wasn't until the late 1990s that he finally bought that dream house. He was already a mega disco polo star. And he shook up his ranks. Daniel! So the 10th will be okay. For what? To hit the road. Where to? Get changed. Daniel, the table is not where your toys belong. It's yummy. Honey, eat up and listen to Mom. Bye. What's on today? A birthday party. You're a present. For how much? Multiply by 4. We were constantly on tour. We signed a contract with a new manager, who pressed for more money. After each concert people came backstage to chat, have a drink. Day in, day out. Zenek was cornered. That's about it. I'll be by the elevator. Zenek. Zenek, my friend. How do you feel? Okay? Come on, why don't you sit down? Just relax. Look, there's a chair. Sit up, or you'll fall off. At 7 we leave for Opole, okay? Don't oversleep. Have a good time. Care for a drink? They say you like beer. Here's to you! Come, baby. Come on. The shoes. Daniel! - What? - The shoes. What's this? - A sweatshirt - To wash? No, it's clean. Then why messed up? Fold it nicely, will you? This as well. Who's there? I don't know. A woman. I'll see what she wants... Dad. Please come home. Zenek, please! An autograph. Over here, please. For a good take. Zenek, look our way! All right, thank you. Thanks! He will be signing, relax! Could you sign it for me? For my daughter Dagmara. Take care of it, okay? One more for my mom, please! She adores you! Zenek! Please move back. We'll be back in a moment for photographs. Move back five steps. Rysiek. Did you take the keyboard? Where's the keyboard? Mariusz has it. - Where is he? - Downstairs? - It's not in the trunk. - I'll find him. - Mariusz! Got the keyboard? - No. You were to take it. Where the fuck is the keyboard? - Calm down. - Stop telling me to calm down! Do you think that I... Get loaded, kick up a row - that you can. But minding the keyboard is too much for you. Go find it! Don't stare like that. Thank you! Locking! Step away, please. - Hi, Dad. - Hi. Wow, it's so cute! For me? Yes. We'll talk later. Danka. Danka. You're away for months and then pop up out of the blue! I've canceled my tour. To be at the birth of your gypsy daughter? What are you talking about? A daughter? With whom? Asking me? Give me a break! That's bullshit. She was here. Very pregnant. It can't be my baby. I've never ever cheated on you! You're never here! I've raised Daniel alone. Healthy or sick. You can't live without concerts -fine! - But to father a bastard! - It's not my baby! Here's her number. She wants money. I don't even know who you're talking about. That Sylwia of yours. Danka, come on! It was a scam indeed. But until Zenek located that girl, the situation was rather tense. She admitted eventually that she wanted to squeeze money out of him. That someone else was the father. Zenek cleared things up and left. Without realizing that his family could be in trouble. Ignoring Danka's observations. Shady figures accosting her or hanging around the house. But he was gone again. When he came back in the end, things could no longer be denied. Daniel! All right. See you, guys. - It won't stick. - It will. Cool, isn't it? It sucks, old folks picking you up. You're not the only one. - Let's go, okay? - Change your tone. Make peace, we're heading for Ostróda! It'll be lots of fun. Hop in. - Let's sing, huh? - Keep your voice for the concert Buckle up, Daniel. Thank you very much! Thank you, Ostróda! Good night! Keep warm, my friends! See you again! Thank you. Can I keep that puppy? No! Dad. Will you clean up after it until ready for outdoors? Sometimes. Sometimes? Not when I'm at school. Puppies keep peeing. The President leaves early Done deal. So we'!! take you to the reception directly from here. - I'll meet the President? - No. For you it's bedtime. I want to go with you. - Who will take him to the hotel? - Our driver, no problem. - I want to see the President. - Bedtime! I'm not going to the hotel! Let's take him, we won't be long. He'll meet the President. He's spoiled enough without receptions. No way. Danka! Daniel! How nice. So we arrived in Ostróda. It was a concert marking Poland's accession to the EU. Too crowded to really enjoy it. Reporters and all. The news that the President would attend added to the commotion. After the concert we were invited to meet the President. After 3 hours or so we were back at the hotel, quite early. Shh... Sorry. Be quiet, you boozer. You're welcome to my room. What's your name, girl? I won't tell you. Can you shut the door? Shh... Hold on. I'll check on Daniel. Is he asleep? I open the door... He's not here. Fuck. Daniel. Danka! So? You don't know who could have done a thing like that... Any enemies? Zenek is a star. People like him have lots of enemies. One may dislike disco polo but they don't necessarily kidnap a child. What are you talking about? It's about money, not disco polo! It's no secret that Zenek is well off. Come back to Bialystok. Will contact you. No police. - Let's go. - I'll drive. No. I want to take it to Daniel's room. Don't say anything. Make yourselves comfortable. Danka. You should've been around rather than touring and partying. - Family is no joke. - I know. Then wake up, Zenek. Nobody will do this for you. Them again? Be ready to pay 200 thousand. Further instructions tonight. 200 thousand! - Relax. I'll take care of it. - Good that somebody will. He made a phone call and left. And came back with the money in an envelope. There's no knowing how he got hold of it. Nobody asked. I remember wondering if Zenek could've called the police. Anyways... We were sitting and waiting for them to say where to leave the ransom. The message came in the evening. And we got things moving. Good evening. I want to leave this. - Just this one? - Yes. - Here you go. - Thank you. I left the money. Have they called? 15 minutes ago. They told Danka to come to the door. She found this. NO POLICE! YOU THINK WE'RE STUPID? GET ANOTHER 200 THOUSAND. INSTRUCTIONS IN 3 HOURS. Where's Danka? We needn't have called the police. I... - I should've listened to you. - It doesn't matter now. I could've taken him to the reception. It's not your fault. Thanks. Remember, Daniel said that a guy offered him a ride back from school? Yes. Lying that you sent him. Did he tell you more about it? - Marcin said it was a flashy car. - Who's Marcin? A friend. They were going to practice together. Danka! We need to call him. - Got his number? - Yes. Where's the phone? Yeah. I'll call back as soon as I have news. Thank you. - That motherfucker was a gypsy. - What gypsy? - I knew that those gypsies of yours. .. - Stop it, okay? Don't make matters worse. Sit on your ass and keep your mouth shut. Listen, guys. I really appreciate your being here in this difficult time. But now that we know who's involved, I'll handle it myself. Please go home. What are you up to? - I must find out who kidnapped my boy. - I'm going with you. Listen! It's about my kid. My son. I need to deal with it on my own. Without nannies or caretakers. Go home! Everybody go home! Fuck! Zenek! Zenek!! - What are you doing? - Going to the camp. Zenek! - What the fuck? - You're not answering my calls. - 'Cause I'm in a hurry. - Don't go there. - Move the car! - Damn! Zenek! You're pushing your luck, bud. But you're my best friend! And I love Daniel like he's my own son. I won't have you going alone. and getting killed! It's a very bad idea. - You'll come there and what? - I'll find him, of course. You can't be sure it's them. - I'll find out. - Asking if they kidnapped your son? Asking whom? Old Vasyl? You know they get pissed off easily. And if it's really them? Then Daniel's in danger. - In any case, I'm on my way. - Me too. I have an idea. What about your car? Get in, dammit! Oh, dear... Give me your phone. Do you know who did it? You take a stroll, okay? Sure. Come on. Mute? - What's he doing here? - I don't know. Hey! Hey! Leave her alone. I know what she did to you. But you broke her heart too. Leave her alone. She has nothing to do with it. I'm helping them all because they have nowhere to go. Them all? Whom? Did you learn anything? Yari is out of prison. - He was released a few months ago. - Yari? It's Yari who did it? Yes. He's a rascal. Perhaps a murderer. And still one of us. So I expect you to settle it without the police. - Yari, after all these years? - Out of revenge. Revenge? No. For the sake of money. No police, okay? - You understand? - Yeah, sure thing. Okay. - Where's the exchange? - Up your ass. Rysiek! Wait a minute! What are you after? Hey! Come on! That's a private area! Daniel! Daniel! Son! There, there. Come on, quick! They're getting away. Yeah, with the kid. - Do the driving, Rysiek. - Get in. Untie him. Come on. Daniel, baby! - Mom, what's happened to you? - Czika gave birth. She did? - How many puppies? - Four. So cute. Still blind. Let's go inside. Just a word with Rysiek. I wouldn't have managed on my own. It's okay, don't mention it. I'd better go. Sure. Me too. Shit! I left my car out there. That's right. Take mine. We'll figure out later how to pick up yours. Thanks a lot. Well... You see... I didn't really mean... to yell... I know. What's the English word for "szelki"? Not sure. .. Suspenders. Come on, Daniel. Can we? - Don't laugh at me. - No comments, Mom. Zenek.
