Erwin C. Dietrich presents White Skin on Black Thighs Don't you feel a little lonely? - Absolutely not. Please. Offer me a drink. - No. Pity. Shouldn't I keep you company? Don't you get it? I'm waiting for someone. - So that's the way it is. Too bad. Ladies and Gentlemen, a round of applause please for our exotic beauty, Marga. The woman is just brilliant. Excuse me. Good evening. May I take a seat? - Please do. Thank you. Order me a drink. - Hello. Do you like my performance so much that you come here so often? You know I do. And now for our sex goddess Lena. I like you. Would you like to come home with me? Are you leaving with me? - Sure I will. You'll be good in bed for sure. Just a minute... - But first, we'll have a drink here. Don't you want to head now? Right after this act. Ok? That was some evening. - Come in. Nice place you've got here. - Thank you. Hands off the merchandise! - I just want a taster. Oh yeah? Stop that. We don't do that where I come from. - What do you do then? That! I haven't hurt you, have I? Come here. Why don't you have a taster? We don't like that either. - So what do you like doing where you are from? Ok. I know what that is. I'll have to get undressed for that. May I use the bathroom? - Yes. You'll have to get undressed as well, darling. Yes. Here I am. Lie down. How could you do something like that? - I didn't push the girl out the window. I'm certain you didn't do that. I mean us. Our marriage. How could you associate with such a cheap whore? And a black one at that! That's not important now. My life is on the line. Were you drunk when the girl plunged out the window? - No. Were you asleep? Have you any idea why she would have done such a thing? Robert, you have really disappointed me. - I am so sorry. I know you would never do anything really bad. I will do everything to help you. But it's over between us. I am sorry too. Try to be understanding. I will never stop loving you. This way please. May I bring you something to drink? - Bring me along drink. With pleasure. - Does someone called Lena work here? Yes. You'll see her shortly. - I would like to speak to her. Could you let her know? She will be delighted. You are very beautiful. - Thanks. Ladies and Gentlemen, we now present our sex goddess Lena! Yes, Ladies and Gentlemen, a round of applause please for the beautiful, sexy Lena! A woman who is very revealing. You wish to speak to me? - Yes. Well then... let's speak. I am the boss around here. You're looking for work? Who sent you? Someone I know? Her name is Marga. Marga is dying. - I know. What's going on here? - I am Robert Kuehn's wife. You know the name. - Who is he? He's the one they think pushed her out the window. What do you want from me? You could help him. I know he didn't do it. Not him! And no-one can understand why Marga would want to compromise him so much. That's why I came directly to you. Help me! Why? Do you think I should help you just because you love your husband? What about me? After all, Marga was my lover. What, I'd like to know, do I get out of it? I am prepared to do anything. That sounds more promising. Yes, much better. I like that a lot. I should think that I can help you more than you imagine; with proof that she did it herself. Would you like to see my apartment now? Mine and Marga's. I am sure you will like it. Come in. Make yourself at home. Come on. Let's see if you can keep your promise. Are you ready to show me that you can fulfil all my wishes? Yes. - Then get undressed. What? - Show me what you can do. - I don't know... Come on. Stay still. Lie down. Yeah... I don't know. Shouldn't I... - No, no. Just stay put. It was a long day and you're tired. We'll talk again in the morning. Good night. 'Morning. - Good morning. Did you sleep well? - Yes, thank you. Are you ashamed that you've had sex with a woman? I very much enjoyed it. Oh yeah... These are Marga's memoirs. Written in her own hand. Could you read a little bit of them for me? Yes. Listen carefully. "My life began with the death of my mother. She, like me, was a prostitute. She had no idea who my father was. There were a lot of men in her life. At that time, Frank was living with us. He exploited her. One night he put his eye on her meagre savings...". Are you searching for something?! - No, I only wanted... - What have you got there? The bag with your money in it. - You filthy pig! Give me that bag! - No need to panic! Give it to me! It's mine! You can't need that much money. I'll kill you! - You'll earn it back in no time. Give that bag back to me! - No. Not so fast! You louser! "I was 14 years old then. Suddenly, I was all on my own. Penniless. And as a result, my life changed. From now on, I hated men. They ought to atone for the death of my mother. They needed to be fleeced, bled dry for that shitty thing called love! But how was I going to do that? I racked my brains. And finally I thought of my aunt. Aunt Bijou. An old school coquette. One difference though. She ran a call girl ring. Yup. She was the one alright. She could help me. Bijou lived in a plush apartment which she also used for her business goings ons. She led a leisurely and, for the most part, an enviably lazy life. Always by her telephone. But she was a smart operator. She knew exactly how to satisfy the desires of her clients. And she passed that on to me. Bijou understood men better than my mother had. She used to say; men are nothing but goldmines. A woman needs to exploit men, and quickly too. For youth and beauty quickly fade... Bijou's customers were often weirdos whose demands were particular in the extreme." Hello. - Hello. Am I speaking to Bijou? Yes. - I apologize for disturbing you. Baroness Stein gave me your telephone number. And who are you? - I am Duke Anastasia... - Yes. And? May I speak to you openly? Naturally. - Can I count on your discretion? Your Grace, I am silent as the grave. What can I do for you? I need a girl. Yes, go on. Any girl in particular? Or would you like me? I was thinking of your niece. You see... Marga? Yes. - That's funny. I would like to know if she is up for anything. Your Grace, for the right money, my niece is prepared to do anything. Money is not a consideration. - You lucky devil. The girl is very gifted. Sounds very promising. When can I come by? 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. - Yes. - Good bye. - Good bye. "She did a lot for me, my Aunt Bijou. But not on my account. She always got her fat commission. As a matter of fact, I didn't like her. She was ambitious, calculating and cold. But I will always be grateful to her for one thing. She brought me together with the young Duke Anastasio. He meant nothing to me. But he was mad about me. And I knew how to work him. He was just a screwed up weakling who needed a firm hand. He was also extremely wealthy." Please be careful. "I enjoyed working on him. I was able to use him for venting my rage at men in general." Don't stop! - Yes. There! My darling black cruel angel. How I love you. You can do what you will with me. I am your slave. "So I was his mistress. And I led a splendid life. All my wishes were fulfilled. In return I gave him the kind of love he wanted from me. He loved it when I whipped him. And I loved to degrade him, a man. And so we were both perfectly happy. But everything comes to an end. After only one year, his wife learnt of our relationship and shot him. For me it was a cloud with a silver lining. He bequeathed me a tidy sum which enabled me to go on living my newly found carefree life. I went back out into the world. I started going to all the 'in' bars. It was on one of the discos that I met Victor. Victor was a handsome, intelligent, sporty superman. Exactly the sort of man women dream of. His having studied psychology for 3 semesters at one point and the fact that he could hypnotize meant it was no problem for him to treat women's emotional complaints. Things were good. In the meantime I had bought my aunt's apartment complete with beds and clients. Her jealousy of my good fortune and wealth knew no bounds. It was around this time that I started to write my memoirs. If Xaviere Hollander or Madame Claude could do that, why not me? In my life, I had experience some wonderful things. Things that many people never even dream of. The experiences Victor had had with the women who came to him were so interesting that I decided to commit them to paper." What's your name? - Emmie Schulze. Emmie Schulze. Oh yes. Hello, Emmie. Nice to meet you. - I am coming to you as a last resort. That's fine. And now, please get undressed. Now Miss Schulze, tell me at your leisure what's troubling you. Yes... An old woman is to blame. Your mother? - No. An old woman from Wanne-Eickel. I believe we are dealing with a doubly repressed mother-substitute syndrome. If you think so... This old woman from Wanne-Eickel was a witch. Close your eyes. Your breasts will become quite warm and heavy. You remember the old woman from Wanne-Eickel. Yes. My mother brought me to her when I was 10 years old. She was clairvoyant. - Your mother? No. The woman! She said I would marry a small green man from Mars. Oh yeah... And she said that I would meet this little green men some day in a cellar. The little green men would fall in love with me and take me away in his space ship. There we will marry, have lots of small green children and be happy until death do us part. Twenty years now I've been searching in every cellar for the little green man of my life. In vain. We'll find him. You only have to believe in him. Close your eyes and tell what else the old woman from Wanne-Eickel said. The little man will be here soon. Yes. Hey is already on the way. The little green men. He's coming soon... He's coming soon and you are deep asleep. Deeper, deeper. Fast asleep. What else did the old witch say? Tell me. That the little Martian would only marry me if I was pure and chaste. And all these years, I have kept myself so. And that wasn't always easy. I met so many interesting men in the cellars that the temptation was sometimes quite great. But I always resisted and dreamt of my little green gentleman. Relax into sleep. Sleep deeply. And now go down into my cellar. There is the little man. - Yes. Yes. I am certain that I can help you. Please. Relax. - Yes. My problem is that I am tense. To be exact, my stride is tense. I don't trust myself to walk on the streets anymore because I think that everyone notices that I have a tense walk. Hello, little green man. Hello, little green man! Yes, close your eyes and fall into a deep sleep. Everything is getting blurry. Your are relaxed and getting hot. You are going into a deeper and deeper sleep. You are getting more and more calm. We will solve your problem one step at a time. Hello, little green man. Yes. Here I am! You'll stride through life carefree and cheerful after my treatment. What are you waiting for? Come here. I'm over here. You are deep asleep and I am concentrating on your problem zone. Come on. Take me in the hand and be nice to me! Yes, here I am. Where? - You are standing right in front of me. Hurry up! Stay asleep. Damn it! Why don't you put me in your hand?! Go on, have it off with me! For god's sake, how often do I have to tell you? I want to sleep with you. Go on, have it off with me! Yes... Yes, yes... Get on with it! Take me! Yes! Yes... We're continuing to sleep. That's lovely. Yes, I love you. I also want to go there too. Yes, yes... Yes, yes! Go on. Right inside! Don't let me fall. If you let me fall, I will burst. You must treat me very carefully. Wow! That is good! Oh my god! Keep going. Don't let me fall though. Keep going. More! No! Help! So Emmie. Now it's my pink fleshman's turn. "After Victor fell in love with me, the other women tried to get treated by him but in vain. He was loyal to me. Until Bijou found out about our love." Oh man, I'm so horny. One moment. Hello. Who's this? Marga. I hope I am not disturbing you. Have you a visitor? - Yes, Bijou is here. In bed. We 're currently getting to know each other better. Carry on. That was Marga. - Now you're inside me. Forget the whore. - Yes. Give me a kiss. "It wouldn't be long before Victor came crawling back to me. I was sure of that. But I would show him. And poor Bijou? Lost to me again. Alas her star was on the wane. The opposite of mine. Life had good things in store for me." Hello? - Is that my dear Bijou? Alas, she doesn't live here anymore. - Who are you? Marga. - Nice name. - Oh thanks. What are you up to? - I've taken over the place. I am Bijou's niece. Interesting. Do you offer the same wares? Yes, only much better quality. When can I come by? I like you voice. You sound promising. When suits you? - Tomorrow? OK. - At 6 pm? - I'll keep myself free. The freer, the better. Right then. 'Til tomorrow. - Ciao. By the way, my name's Lena. Ciao. Ciao, Lena. "Lena. I couldn't have guessed that Lena would become the most important person in my life. The following day I was to meet the person who would make my life fulfilled. Today however, I was still a madam." Marga? - Yes? Are you angry at me? Come here. Go on. Come and kiss my hand. - I am your slave. And my feet. Ah, you're the pits. Bijou wiggles her butt in front of your nose and you come running. You're pathetic. - Marga, I only live for you now. Enough. Please. You men are a pack of liars. Marga, I love you. - And cheats, all of you. Will you forgive me? - I forgive you for everything. Really? - Sure it stayed in the family. I love only you. Enough of that. - What's wrong? I don't love you anymore. You're just a loser. But Marga! Marga, it's you I love. I love you. And I need you. You know that Bijou means nothing to me. You are the only woman in my life. There is no other for me. I know that now. You can demand what you want. You can have anything that your heart desires. Just don't turn me away. There's no point going on. I promise, you won't regret it. Ok? It will cost you. - I beg you. You can have whatever you want. - We can talk about it. Agreed? - Alright. Agreed, for today. Maybe for the last time, who knows. Yes, who knows. Exactly. I think so too. Yes. You have a good think about it. You wouldn't regret it. I'll make sure of that. You are the only woman for me. You must belong to me alone. "Poor little Victor. I was sorry but it was the last time after all that I let him near me. The following day Lena stormed into my life. It was love at first sight. She needed a coloured partner for a new sex show in her night club. Enthusiastically, I put myself at her disposal. From Lena, I learned what love is. She was the zenith of my life." No, stay put. I'll turn on the light. Alright... "Today, Lena betrayed me with a man. Clearly my luck has left me. I will end it all. And a man will accompany me to the death. The first man to try to seduce me today will pay for my unhappiness on this earth." The telephone... Hello? Yes. I'll be right there. What is it? - Marga has regained consciousness. Lena. Oh Lena! How could you do something like that? It was a terrible thing for me to go through. Why didn't you tell me? Ladies and Gentlemen. Please take your seats. You are about to witness our newest attraction. "I knew that you were working on a new number. But how I guess that you would do it with a man. And my heart stopped when I saw with whom..." Darling, do you want to be left in peace? - No. Am I disturbing you? I can go. No. Stay here. I want to show you how much I love you. "They are in love. You love Victor. And as I love you, I know exactly why I say it. It is crazy. But for you, the most beautiful act of love can only take place in public. There, you can give yourself completely. And if your partner truly loves you, you are still capable of wonderfully expressing the full beauty of erotic love before the audience." Deeper. That's good. I won't last. Do you love me? - You know I do. Stay inside me. Keep going. I'm nearly there. "My whole life just fell apart. My number was on next. For the last time." Hello? Yes. And then? Thank you. I'm on my way. Marga is much better. She can talk and wants to see me. I am delighted for you. They are saying that she will declare that your husband is innocent. I knew it! No person could be so mean. I do understand her motive. - You must believe that all lesbians are bad people. Do you? I like you very much. - I like you too. You are about to have visitors. But you mustn't get agitated... Yes. Hello. There they are. Her condition has substantially improved but don't stay longer than a few minutes. Hello, Marga. - Hello. My silly little darling. There was no reason for you to do such a thing. You should know me better than that. What happens on the stage has nothing to do with me. You and I, we belong together. For ever, yes? Yes. - So that's settled. Now hurry up and get better. I want you to come home. Hello. May I come in? Oh Robert! Of course you may! I know I am a pig. And you must forgive my indiscretion. Nothing like that will ever happen again. I can understand why you wandered. I failed as a women. And I was silly and inexperienced at making love. From now on, it will be completely different.
