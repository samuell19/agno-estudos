Tomorrow we'll let him loose. God-damned whore! And god help him! Horrible! It's the end of the world! A flock of angels came down... Exactly like that. If that's an angel, I'm Elvis Presley. Pelayo, dammit... Wake up! Get up! Yes, I saw it with my own eyes. I swear it! Came down from the sky... all full of clouds. What you told me about the trumpets. The trumpets sounded... Get out of here! Out, dammit! Out this way... out... out this way! - Stop your tricks. - So much La-di-da. Go to hell! Come! They're all over there... Blessed Ave Maria... looking at "the angel"!

"A hair-raising story." "A huge albino vampire..." "has been captured alive..." "in a delightful beach resort." Didn't I tell you? it's true. Believe it or not...

Life is worth nothing... if I should stay sitting. They're calling me from everywhere. Life is worth nothing... when others are killing each other... ...but I sing as if nothing were happening. Life is worth nothing... ...and it's not able to touch my faltering heart. Life is worth nothing... if I ignore that the assassin. Has taken another road and prepares another ambush. Life is worth nothing if a compadre is tricked... ...if four fall every minute... ...and in the end it is force that decides the day. Life is worth nothing if I have to postpone... ...if in the end, what surrounds me. Cannot charge as if it were my own. Life is worth nothing... when others are killing each other... ...but I sing as if nothing were happening. Only to die in a bed. Life is worth nothing... ...if in the end, what surrounds me.
