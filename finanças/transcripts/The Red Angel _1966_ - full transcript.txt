SELECTED FOR THE 1966 ARTS FESTIVAL RED ANGEL ORIGINAL STORY BY YOSHICHIKA ARIMA PHOTOGRAPHY BY SETSUO KOBAYASHI MUSIC BY SEI IKENO STARRING AYAKO WAKAO SHINSUKE ASHIDA - YUSUKE KAWAZU DIRECTED BY YASUZO MASUMURA My name is Sakura Nishi. I left Japan for China in May, 1939. I was assigned to the Tientsin Army Hospital. Nurse Taniguchi and you four, surgery. Nurse Nishi and you three, general medicine. Nishi. Half of your patients are in serious condition. The other half are not. Most of them either have tuberculosis or some psychological problems. Some don't have anything wrong with them at all. Watch out for them. Many of them know how to fake a fever by shaking the thermometer. Mental patients who've recovered pretend they're sick. They'd rather lounge around here than do their duty at the front. It's your job to see through their tricks. You will spend every day with them. Do you understand? From the outside, it looks like any military hospital you'd find in Japan, but a field hospital is something very different. Ah, you're a new arrival? Where were you posted before this? After nursing school, I spent three years at a Tokyo army hospital. You're from Tokyo? So am I. From the Kiba area. So your family is in the lumber trade? My grandfather had been, but I don't remember it at all. Why is that? My father died before I was born, and my mother died when I was two years old. My aunt raised me. How old are you? I'm 24. I'm Private Sakamoto, also from Tokyo. Be good to me. Tokyo, eh? Damn it! That makes me homesick! Nishi, time for night rounds. Stop it! I'll scream! Go ahead. Let me go! Let me go! Relax, no use fighting it. Everyone's bored. The show will do them good. The next night I made a full report of the incident. I see. Private Sakamoto again? You're his third. He hasn't fully recovered yet, but I can't let him get away with this anymore. Hello, nurse. I'm being sent back to the front. A death sentence. Congratulate me. Thanks for everything. Good luck. I really enjoyed the show the other night. It's my turn next. Locked up here all day, a man needs a woman. Two months later, I was transferred somewhere even worse. Hell couldn't be much worse. A hospital at the front. FIELD HOSPITAL Bullet wound. He's dead. Surgery. Bury this one. Amputation. Dead. Put my foot back on! Don't be stupid! Amputation. All right, son. We'll stop the pain. Nothing to be done here. Surgery. Help me! Please! Control yourself! Take out the dead. Amputation, at the thigh. Anesthetic? Just local. He's a kicker. Hold him down. Idiot! Get back here! Mother! Okay, he's done. I'll sew him up. Bandage! More than 200 operations In three days and nights. Lieutenant Okabe, the surgeon, the medics and nurses all went without sleep. Arm next. Hold him down. More and more soldiers were carried in. Many died before surgery. Many died awaiting surgery. Some died on the operating table. Others, afterwards. They all went to the morgue. Get their tags, or we won't know who they were. There were mountains of tags. It was the end of the third day. His pulse is strong. He's lost too much blood. He's a goner. Nurse Nishi. It's me, Sakamoto. Please save me. I'm so sorry for what I did to you. I don't want to die. I want to live. I'm begging you. Don't leave me! Nurse Nishi, please don't let me die. Don't kill me! Doctor. What is it? He needs a transfusion. Anesthetic. Only colonels and higher get transfusions. I know this man. Please, Doctor. How do you know him? He was my patient in Tientsin for a while. Not kin? Not even a friend? No, sir. We're swamped. These others have a better chance. Wait. I'll do it if you visit me in my quarters tonight. Thank you, sir. Just this once. I didn't want him to die. I didn't want him to think that was my revenge, that I'd deliberately kill him. The transfusion didn't work. By the end of the shift, he was dead. Mr. Sakamoto? What's the matter? No pulse. His pupils are dilated. He was shot in the guts. That's certain death anyway. A total waste of valuable blood. We'll take him out, throw him in the pile. Another corpse! Who is it? Nurse Nishi. Come in. Excuse me. Ah, you kept your word. Were you joking? No, I meant it. Pour me some wine. The spoils of war. The man we gave the transfusion to died. No surprise there. If he'd lived, it would have been a miracle. I'm sorry I caused you trouble. You can't afford to have favorites among the patients. Soldiers aren't human beings. They're just weapons. If you knew he would die, why did you operate? Before I was drafted, I was a highly skilled surgeon. Here, I'm not even a doctor. I have to decide who will live, whether I can save them or not. Sometimes, I long to be a doctor again. I knew he'd die, but I did my best anyway. The last vestiges of my professional pride made me go through the motions. Have a drink. You'll sleep better. Yes, sir, I will. How can I save truckloads of them? Ruptured blood vessels, smashed bones... Loss of blood or gangrene gets most of them. We have no blood supply and virtually no medicine. So I cut off their arms and their legs, whether they need it or not. They say that I'm an expert at it. I've chopped off hundreds of limbs. I've crippled hundreds of men. God knows how many. But you had to save their lives. You think they believe that? They'd be better off dead. What I'm doing is wicked. Either I let them die, or I maim them for life. That's all. Can I call myself a doctor? It's a wonder I don't go mad. The war's to blame, not you. The war, eh? As we attack, our lines get longer. The enemy turns around and attacks our rear, where our defenses are weak. China is too damn big. It's a stupid war. But that's the army's problem, not mine. Take off your uniform. I can't get drunk in front of a nurse. That's an order! Yes, sir. There's no tomorrow on the battlefield. We live from day to day. What happens today, whatever we do, fades tomorrow. You have nothing to worry about. Now, come here. What's your first name, Nishi? Sakura. Sakura? Cherry blossom? Just think, if you live long enough, you will become a 60 or 70-year-old Sakura. Cherry blossoms only last a few brief days. I love my name. I'd like to live up to my name. Who named you? My father. He died before I was born. In photographs, he looks like you. That's enough wine. Now I need a shot. Everything's in that drawer. What kind of injection is this? Never mind. Just do as I say. Yes, sir. It's morphine, sir. Hurry up. It's almost dawn. There's no time. I just want to sleep. I just want to forget everything. Nishi, will you stay here until I fall asleep? Summer nights are cold here. If you're cold, you can share my blanket. I was exhausted. I only wanted to sleep. Next! Are you awake? It's noon. You've slept for 10 hours straight. Go back to sleep. I must go. They'll manage without you. I told them you are exhausted. Doctor! What? Did anything happen? Do you think I took advantage of you? You undressed me. I didn't touch you. Not that it matters. What does that mean? You wouldn't understand. I'll go back. We nurses returned to Tientsin? In a truck with the sick and wounded. By that time, I couldn't get Dr. Okabe out of my mind. Perhaps I had begun to love him. TIENTSIN MILITARY HOSPITAL How was the front? Do I smell? What of? Blood and gore. I almost scrubbed my skin off, but... Your imagination. That's how you become a real nurse. Head Nurse, what kind of man is Dr. Okabe? He's a fine officer, an excellent surgeon. You're in charge of surgery this time. Nurse, can you help me urinate? In a moment. Why were both of your arms amputated? The left one was blown off. Gangrene set in on the right one, so the doctor... Thank you. Which doctor? Dr. Okabe. He caught the tetanus in time, which saved my life. How long have you been here? Six months. My wounds have healed, but... You can't return to battle. Are you going home? Are you married? I shipped out two months after my wedding. You want to go home, then? You must be anxious to go home. Yes. But for some reason, they haven't allowed it. I'm only a nuisance to others here now. It would be better to be home. Private Orihara's almost fully recovered. He hardly feels any pain. Why wasn't he sent home? I'm not sure. But that is not our concern. We're short of beds as it is. It's best for him and for us that he goes home. Nishi, that's quite enough. It's not your place to make those kind of decisions. Yes, ma'am. I just feel sorry for him. Nurses are not to indulge in feelings. It's your duty to keep quiet and do your work. I've given up hope. I don't think I'll ever go home. Never? Thanks. Not that I think that the war will last forever. Then why won't you go home? A soldier who lost both legs was finally sent back home, but the army kept him hidden away. Even his family isn't allowed to visit him. They'll probably keep him institutionalized forever. That's my fate, too. But why? If people saw me, they'd know how terrible war is and hate it. Some would think we're losing the war. The army brass wouldn't like that at all. Now and then, I wish I were dead. You poor man. It must be agony. It's okay. I'm used to it now. The one unbearable thing, the one thing I still can't stand... What is it? It's... No, never mind. It's nothing. Let me give you a sponge bath. Nurse Nishi, would you mind doing it at night? Why? I can't show you any special favors. I don't want the others to see me. Tonight, after lights out. Please. Let's do it now. I'm sorry to put you to such trouble. Nurse Nishi, can you come every night from now on? If you want me to. Please, I'd like you to. You nurses take care of our meals and everything with never a frown. It's our duty. But there's one thing that no one does for me. Do you know what I mean? Nurse Nishi, even in this state, I'm still a man. I'm crippled, but I'm still healthy. The others all can manage somehow, but I have no hands. I'm helpless. It's starting to drive me mad. Do you understand? Yes, I learned about that at nursing school. Nurse Nishi, please relieve me. Touch my body. I beg you. Have you asked the other nurses for such a favor? No, ma'am, I've never asked anyone before. Only you. Nurse Nishi, I'm just filth. I'm a despicable man. I'm going to die without ever seeing my wife again. Nurse Nishi, please help me. Medicine, everything was scarce. Poor Dr. Okabe could only amputate arms and legs. However trivial, I decided I'd try to ease his burden in my own way. Nurse Nishi, am I asking too much? Not at all. Thank you. You're the only one who cared enough to relieve me like this. You poor, unfortunate man. Nurse Nishi, please let me kiss you. Just once is enough. Sakura, I want to touch your body. I don't mind, but... Since I lost my hands, my toes have become very sensitive. I can feel with them just like my hands. So... So? Please. Let me put my foot between your legs. Please. All right. I'm glad. I'm very happy. Take him outside for a walk? Yes, he can manage. I think it will be good for him. But all alone? I'll escort him. I'm off today. I see. All right, then. We can't do much else for him. Be sure he wears an overcoat so his arms won't be too obvious. Treat him to something nice. What is it? Where are we going? Let's find a hotel. A hotel? Just leave everything to me. Let's take a bath together. Together? I'll wash you. You can look at me all you want. Do anything you like. Tell me anything you want me to do for you. Why are you doing this for me? No particular reason. I have no arms, but I can do things to make up for it. But this won't happen again. It's the last time. Yes. Probably. Remember it. I'll never forget what happened today. I'm truly very happy. Nishi, Private Orihara committed suicide. How? He has no arms. He jumped from the roof. Fractured skull. He died instantly. I can't believe it. This was found under his pillow. Used his mouth to write it, I guess. It's to you. I haven't told anyone else. Sakura, I'll never meet anyone like you again, so there's no point in living. Thank you and goodbye. Orihara. Will you inform his family? He'll be listed as killed in action and receive a promotion to private first class. I believe I killed him. I thought I was helping him, but I was tormenting him instead. It's not your fault. In wartime, it's every man for himself, or there's no surviving it at all. Forget him as soon as you can. There's too much to forget. I can never forget. Private Sakamoto and then Private Orihara. I killed them both. A month later, we five nurses were transferred back to the front. Unload the weapons. I'm back again. Been keeping well, sir? You're back? You and I are destined to be together. You've been promoted. Congratulations. The more people we kill, the more stars they give us. It's a strange life. Has there been major fighting? Yes, Chiang Kai-shek and his allies have launched an attack. Our army is stretched very thin. They were cut to pieces. The wounded are arriving in droves. You have surgical experience. I'll have you removing bullets. Can we manage? We have to! A handful of Japanese soldiers are pitted against all of China. It's no easy war. The wounded will increase. We're badly undermanned here. You'll have to work twice as hard. If not, good men will die. Yes, sir. We will, sir. The wounded are arriving, sir. Be right there. Please kill me! Water! Give me water! Be careful! No dead in here! The bullet is still in there. Remove it. We began operating and kept operating for two days and two nights. I myself removed 160 bullets. We can't save him. He's been gutted. He's lost too much blood. Do you know why the enemy did this? No, sir. He swallowed this. It's a secret code. A communications man. No time to burn it, so he swallowed it. They cut him open to get it. While he was still alive? Yes. A first-class soldier. You did your duty well. A hero's death. He's dead. Sew him up and ship him out. Shrapnel in the lower back. I'll have to operate. Anesthetic. I've changed my mind. Close him up. Next patient. Why did he stop? A waste of anesthetic. There's something different about him today. The third night, after all of the soldiers had been treated. Nishi? Yes, sir. Come in. Yes, sir. Sit down and have a drink. May I ask a question, sir? What is it? Why didn't you operate after you had the anesthetic administered? Officers don't need to explain themselves to lower ranking soldiers. I'll explain, though you probably won't understand. Why is that, sir? You're a woman, but you have no marital experience, right? What's marriage got to do with it? He was wounded in the sacrum. Here. All the sensitive nerves that govern sex are located there. If I operated on those damaged nerves, what would be the result? He'd lose his masculinity. Forever! It made me think. If it doesn't fester, he has a chance to live. If a good doctor operates back home, he may leave the nerves intact. So I changed my mind. I see. I have no confidence in the work I'm doing here. It's all wrong. I kill those who'd recover. Men better off dead live as cripples. But... To men, becoming impotent is worse than being crippled. I'm tired. Give me a morphine shot. I want some sleep. Stay until I fall asleep, like you did last time. Hold me, if you want to. Yes, if I'll do, sir. I wouldn't ask anyone else. Will you stay till morning? Don't worry. You'll be safe with me. I won't even touch you. Why not? These days, I have no interest in women at all. We live in different worlds. I only want to sleep. But why, sir? You really want to know? Yes, I do. All right, then. I'll tell you. Since I started using morphine, I'm not a man anymore. I haven't been for a long time. You have a wife, don't you? She died three years ago, so it doesn't matter. Please stop using morphine. Why? I want to be in your arms. What? I think I love you. I want you to touch me. You love me? What a strange girl. You resemble my father. A substitute, am I? No! I really love you. Sorry, I can't give up the morphine. Why not? I'm a doctor, but I can't do anything here. Without the drugs, I can't go on living. It's the same for soldiers. They commit murder and call it patriotism. There are so many things that I'd like to forget. Nishi, it's no use talking. Just give me the shot. Then get into bed. Yes, sir. I missed you. I really did. Good night. Good night, sir. You pig! Letting the maggots hatch! What's the matter? He removed a bandage and let flies settle on it. Now it's festered! Why did you do that? He was afraid of being sent back. He wants to be sent home! What if you lose your leg? It's better than dying. My wife gave birth after I shipped out. I've never seen my son. Dr. Okabe wants to see you immediately. I'm off to the front lines. One doctor, two nurses and three medics. We leave tomorrow morning. Were you ordered to? Yes. It's a tough battle. Only one doctor there. He can't cope alone. It's an emergency. So it's goodbye for a while. Please take me with you. It's too dangerous. You could be killed. No! I don't want to leave you. Why not? I love you. Love? Do as you like. But don't expect a life together. This is war. We could die at any moment. I wonder. The only way to get through this is to consider everyone a stranger. So stay. The head nurse said that, too, but I refuse to do that. It's an order. I refuse. You're disobeying an order? I am. That's treason. There is something I fear more than anything else. That is working and dying apart from you. Don't worry. I'll be back. Wait for me. No, please take me with you. You're stubborn. Who else, then? Nurse Tsurusaki. She's new and inexperienced. I'll take care of her. Even further from Japan. It doesn't bother me. Ever nearer to death. I don't care. Are you ready to die? The cherry blossom has such a short life. The sooner, the better. Halt! Is Dr. Okabe here? Yes, what is it? Your new orders, sir. Go ahead. You're to stay with us until further orders. We're in your hands. We'll escort you there, sir. Good man. We're here, sir. Excuse the men, ma'am. It's their first sight of Japanese nurses. They're ecstatic. Time to head back. I'm Lieutenant Ishida, in command of this outpost. Please be seated. Our headquarters are 50 kilometers from here. The enemy has begun a massive attack. They broke through our lines. We've been cut off. I see. So that's why our journey was cut short. Yes, sir. The enemy is better equipped and outnumbers us. We're unable to break through. We're surrounded? Yes, they've attacked twice. A mobile squad helped fight them off. Just one platoon here? Yes, equipped with four light machine guns. That's all we have. Any civilian Chinese? A handful of children and the elderly. - Doctor. - What? A comfort woman has diarrhea. I suspect cholera. Please examine her. Attention! It's cholera, all right. She's badly dehydrated. Quarantine her and give her warm water for 48 hours. She may pull through. How many comfort women here? Two more, sir. They may have it, too. Isolate them. Disinfect this hut thoroughly. It's off limits to the men. Cholera? That's one more enemy. Is there nothing we can do? No drug touches cholera. Just isolation and disinfection. Ideally, we should just burn down the village and pull out. That's impossible. This is a strategic point. We're ordered to hold it at any cost. In any case, the cholera must be contained. Otherwise, we all die. Issue the men an acid gargle before meals. The soldiers want the women who aren't sick. Here they are. Back to your cribs. No! They're in quarantine. How about you, then? Much more fun. Stop it. Nurses aren't comfort women. You're hungry, aren't you? Hungry for a man. I'll give you a good time. You animal! This is the front. We either kill men, screw women or eat rations. That's all. We get what we can while we're still alive. You idiots! You want to die of cholera? Get out! You doctors get your pick of nurses. We don't. Twelve men and two comfort women are infected now. That's seven dead. How does it look? There will be more. The problem is that we lost half of our fighting strength. If they attack, we'll be wiped out. Sir, all of the remaining Chinese civilians have slipped away. Afraid of the cholera? No doubt, some spies, too. Spies? They must have introduced the cholera virus. They fed something to her. Then the enemy knows our exact disposition? Yes, expect an attack anytime. Contact HQ. Ask for reinforcements. We can't sir. Our radio is down. Send a courier. To certain death? We're surrounded. No one could make it through alive. We're expecting a truck tomorrow morning. We'll just have to wait it out. What's the matter, sir? I've caught it. Sergeant, a signal! That's bad. They'll attack tonight. The doctor's asking for you. Go at once. Take a break, nurse. You've worked all night. We'll take over. Nurse Tsurusaki. Nishi? Yes, sir. Come in. Nurse Nishi reporting for duty, sir. What's the latest count? Four new cases, sir. If I catch it, I'll give it to you. Same thing if you get it. Why did you summon me, sir? It's time for my shot. I refuse. But I need it. Nishi, that's an order! Morphine is only for the critically wounded. I'm starting to suffer from withdrawal symptoms. Soon the fits will come. I don't want the others to see me half-crazed. Please, go get the morphine. If you don't quit now, it will affect your brain. Your heart will weaken, and you'll die. I'm better off dead. It's also the drugs that are keeping us apart. Please give it up. What would I gain? You'd gain me. You're a woman. Yes, the woman who loves you. How do I quit? Please do as I say, as if I were a superior officer. You're ordering me to quit? I'll tie you up and do what I have to do. Tie me up? Yes. We're caught between cholera and the enemy. This could be our last night. Be my superior officer tonight. Do what you must, but don't let anyone in. The Captain is down with cholera. I'll take over the command. I expect an attack tonight. Man your positions! Just tonight... They'll attack tonight. The truck comes tomorrow. We must not surrender the village. Nurse Nishi. Nishi. You had it tough. I'm over it now. Untie me. How long was I thrashing? Five hours. Two more have got it. Please love me as a woman. Please love me. I can't. I want to be a real woman. Not just a doll. Make love to me. I can't. I'm not a man anymore. No, that's all in your mind. Without the morphine, you can. Nishi, touch me. That's what I am. Do you understand now? I can't love you. No, you're all right. Hold me close, as tight as you can. It's no use. Don't give up. You can do it. No, I'll never return to my old self. You can. I know you can. It's 0100 hours. Not long until dawn. Hold out till then. Their small arms don't frighten me, but if they bring in mortars, we're all dead. I can hardly believe it, Nishi. Nurse Nishi has won. I'm myself again. It's like a miracle. Please say that you love your Sakura cherry blossom. You want me to say that I love you? I want you all to myself. You already have. Your heart, too. Not in wartime, no. There's only fleeting pleasure. Not for me. I don't want to be a passing fancy. I want to be your true lover. I have no heart to offer you now. Then I'll look for it. It's 0200 hours already. Another three hours and we'll be safe. They like to attack at dawn! Be alert! Sakura. I love you. Now I can say it truthfully. I'll never let you go. Tonight we reached our greatest ecstasy. Though by tomorrow, we may be dead. You don't mind that? This is all that's important to me now. Get me the wine. It's my last bottle. Let's drink a toast. I didn't know that military women were so sweet. Military women? I mean you nurses. Put on my uniform. How do I look? Wonderful. A dashing officer. The boots. Would they salute me if I went out? First, they'd laugh. The sword and gun. I'm afraid not. Okabe, pour wine for your superior officer. Here, Major. Sergeant! What is it? The enemy! I prefer being a woman. Then let me give you some pleasure. I can hear your heart thumping. It's the wine. Nishi. I wish we'd met in Japan in peacetime. They're attacking. The enemy. There's no escape. Will you die with me? Yes, by your side. I'm 40 years old. A long life, yet short, too. I guess this is the end. I can die happy because I love you. Your mark, Sakura? I'll give you one. Where? The same place as yours. Thanks to you, I can die like a soldier. Don't cry for me. Enemy attack, sir! Follow me. Stay here! Head down! Hold your fire! It's still too dark. Don't waste ammo! Wait till they're close! What's the situation? We're surrounded, sir. They're using mortars to soften us up. We don't have enough soldiers to fight. It doesn't look good. But it's an hour till dawn. There's a slim chance. Good. We're soldiers, too! Orderlies and nurses will fight! Fire! Give them all you've got! Pull yourself together, nurse! Protect your patients! Here they come! Dig in! The sergeant is dead, sir! I'll take command. Fight! Fire at least one shot before you die! I'm scared! You'll fight! I'm too scared! Come back! Go get her! She's gone crazy! No, that'd be suicide. I've killed yet again. She's my third victim. Nogami! Somehow, I survived. Not even a scratch. Anybody still alive? Halt! Who goes there? Army nurse! We're reinforcements. We routed them. You're safe now. Stay back! We have a cholera epidemic. Cholera? Send medical personnel immediately. Any other survivors? I don't know. The cholera and the fighting took most of them. I understand. Wait here. Nurse Tsurusaki, forgive me. This is how I will end up, too. The bodies were stripped of their clothing. Weapons, clothing, boots... They took everything that they could possibly use. Doctor! Doctor! Dr. Okabe! Dr Okabe! Dr. Okabe. THE END
