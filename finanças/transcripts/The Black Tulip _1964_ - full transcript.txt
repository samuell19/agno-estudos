Yes, French Revolution had its heroes ... its martyrs and its Saints. Historians, who have superbly told us about it,.. with almost miraculous insight, knew how to discover, get out of the shadows,.. obscure figures, seemingly irrelevant,.. and of whom, without them, we would have never known they existed. Yet, by a strange phenomenon,.. there is an essential and determining character,.. whom they have unanimously ignored. But, fortunately, cinema is here,.. with its camera exploring the time,.. its lens that pierces the mists of time. Thanks to it, this great, underrated figure will finally be revealed! Justice is going to be made! It is June 1789. In June. That is to say that July 14 has not yet occurred. Nor, moreover, the massacres of September. Of course. But already, while Paris agitates and rumbles,.. the province stirs and jolts. For it is in province, exactly somewhere in France, here,.. there, you see, that blows the wind of revolt. Someone, but who?, foments this uprising! Someone, but who?,.. worries, threatens, the nobles and their privileges! Someone, but who?, acts on behalf of the people! For the people! The authority puts a price on the head of this someone. In vain. Because the authority has no power. Then, in panic, aristocrats prepare to flee,.. taking along the profits of their plunder,.. their entire fortune. "Well, goodbye, Mr. Baron! And good luck!" But the other one watches. This one is a valiant and determined man, as his name indicates. The Black Tulip! Remember this name. He will go down in history. In our own, anyway. The Black Tulip,.. and his horse, Voltaire. The Black Tulip Come on, quickly! Thank you. He took everything! My fortune,.. my jewels, those of the Countess! You hear, Mr. Lieutenant General of Police? The exploits of the Black Tulip, they do not heat up your ears? And do you think you might, one day, honor your role and your title,.. Mr. Lieutenant General of Police? But Marquis, my zeal! The head of the Black Tulip! I want his head here! On this desk, before Monday. You'll get it, guaranteed. The head and the rest! I don't need the rest. The head will suffice! And your diamonds will be soon returned, Count. You seem so sure of yourself. - I'm not sure of anyone. But I think, however, to have identified the Black Tulip. Great progress! A low-born adventurer! No, my lord! Someone you know very well. Someone familial with your home. - A servant. A servant is not a familial. And Count Guillaume De Saint Preux is not a servant! What? What do you say? Saint Preux? Impossible! He is one of my friends! You're raving, Mr. La Mouche! The Count De Saint Preux! Nobody less than him looks like a tulip! It's insane, it's unbelievable, monstrous. And it's ridiculous! You know La Mouche latest stunt? - No. - Brace yourself, my dear. He claims, this simpleton, that the Black Tulip is your friend Saint Preux! Guillaume? - You said it! La Mouche really knows little of botany. And on what basis does he? On his dislike for Saint Preux. He is extremely jealous of him. And I understand him, however. Right, what evidence have you against Saint Preux? My conviction. - His conviction! Yes, my conviction, supported by some clues. Of course, he is clever, and we need more convincing arguments. But if we caught him in a flagrant act of banditry... - I'd be very surprised! I have my plan. A trap, in my way. Ah! Finally! A moment please, as I complete this page. You made me wait. Take turns. What a welcome! After all trouble I have faced to come! Pleasure is not obtained without pain, my dear. It's not a right, it's a favor. Must be deserved. Well, make yourself comfortable! I don't really like being treated like a girl. Imagine how you'd feel if I treated you like a mother! There! Now you can come. On my lap. Hello Catherine Hello, Guillaume. Very good You think this spot is apt for an honest woman? Many honest women have being there, without repentance, as far as I know. How long do you have? - 2 hours will suffice? Two hours... Yes. We won't have time to do everything, but... but it's okay. First I must tell you, before I forget. It's so funny! Imagine that my husband... - Oh, no! Is this a place to talk about your husband? Have some dignity, get up! I can fool him and still be respectful! Then, it concerns you, not him! Get up anyway, because we are very thirsty! So, your husband? Well, my husband had a talk with baron La Mouche. Guess what the Baron said? - Something silly, of course! He claims to know who is the Black Tulip! What's to do with me? - Wait! He is sure that you and the Black Tulip, it's all one! No! - Yes! That's funny! - On my honor, he said so! La Mouche? - Yes. And what does your husband think of this snitching? That this shouldn't prevent you from being at Friday's meeting. The envoy of Count d'Artois.. came specially from Paris to give us his instructions. The Queen decided to do away with the 3rd State. - She's right! It deserves a good correction. No more than 1:50, my angel. You think about it? But, object of my pleasure, can't you see I only think of that? That I look forward to honor you with my high favors? You're beautiful, so dressed only in your virtue! Only in your virtue... Finally! What is it, my heart? - There, on the floor, a black tulip! My God! What will happen to us? Beware! Go! Go! Well... Down with the mask, Mr. De Saint Preux! Show me your face! Marked. You are marked! You won't escape me more! Voltaire! He won't go far. Lieutenant, alert all police stations. Blocks on all routes, and arrest anyone with a scar on his left cheek. The Black Tulip will soon be plucked! Vulture, rabble, scum! No, no, not talking about you! I think of La Mouche. You, Voltaire, you are a brave man. Well, a real lion! So, how is it? Bad. Here. Bless you. - It's not me. It's the stomach. So, what next? Shall we go to Paris? - What? Marked as you are, you cannot remain here. I have some scores to settle. With that face? Too bad you don't have a spare one! Brignolle, get ready to leave. Ah, you've become reasonable. No! Not what you think, Brignolle. I said "you get ready to go". Immediately. Stop! Your road map. What's going on? Shut up. - Ah, police! Here. Okay. You! Get off! Get off? But why? Get off! No arguing! - But sir... Your face! - How? My face... How about that! - Come on, move! You'll hear from me! - Silence. Go, Go! Julien! It's great, You haven't changed. You haven't changed either. Well, Brignolle, what do you think of this? Can't believe my ears! Looks like you even more than in the coach. How do you like my little brother? A handsome guy. Thanks for us! It's true that with my scar... Did he tell you? He told me that you were injured. That you needed me. I don't know more. So, you came because you wanted to know more, huh? No, no! I came because you're my brother. And because... Because you love me, old rabbit! So say it! Always so bashful, huh? A real little sister, my little brother! Brignolle, make us an omelet! - You know, I really changed in four years. Indeed, you've grown up and almost caught up with me. Yes, and then also... - And then, also? I think I also ... I think I overcame my ... my ... - Conquered! Who conquered what? Have you cut your tongue? Overcome what? - My shyness! You know, I wanted to be like you. Ambitious, alright! Oh, I did not envy you, no. But I always admired you. I always admired your force, your courage! Your generosity! Oh, Guillaume, I so much wanted to resemble you! -Yes Well, if you resemble me, you must have a ravenous hunger! Yes, true. And thirst? - Yes, I am thirsty. To brotherhood! - To freedom! To equality! - To justice! To law, and long live the nation! You too? - What, me too? Can it be? You too share my ideals? Yes. And this omelet. Come sit down. You, whom I knew so proud of your blazon, indifferent to the people! Well yes! You admired my boldness and my force,.. I, your purity and enthusiasm. And without consulting one another.. tonight we come together! 1 and 1 do not make 2, but 1. People, thy will be done! You read Rousseau? The "Social Contract" is my bedside book. Bred on Jean-Jacques and raw meat! Serve yourself. That's why you chose to live in this humble mill. The return to nature. - No. Circumstances forced me to take refuge here. - Circumstances? What circumstances? - Unfortunate circumstances. Ever heard of the Black Tulip? - The Black Tulip? - Yes. The Black Tulip who makes tremble profiteers, tax collectors,.. and who fights against tyranny? Well then Julien, the Black Tulip, look at me,.. it's it! I mean, it's me. No! Oh yes! Oh, Guillaume! You are twice my brother. You are twice as dear to me! Guillaume De Saint Preux is the Black Tulip! But... but I am the brother of the Black Tulip! Me. Me! Me! Give me of this brave Roussillon wine. It is like you, young, lively, exhilarating, friendly! Guillaume Black of the Tulip of Saint Preux! I would so like to be you! So be it! You shall be Guillaume De Saint Preux for a few days. Yes, the time for a scar. Julien, I'm in mortal danger. My head has a price on. This mark was made by the police lieutenant general la Mouche.. while I was attacking a tax collector. However, I must attend tomorrow night in an important political meeting.. with the Marquis De Vigogne. I must, you understand? It is imperative that they see me there. Not appearing, would cause my ruin. To show up, would cost my life. You shall go to it. But, the Marquis De Vigogne, isn't he of the party of the Queen? - Certainly! And the Black Tulip would compromise with such people? - But.. one learns very interesting things with Vigogne. One gets aware of the intrigues of the court.. of the shenanigans of the Duke d'Artois. One can thwart a lot of conspiracies! And you will have your gratification. We're the lover of the Marquise. - What? Complaints? - Want to oblige me to... - Not an obligation, a possibility. I bring you a conquered woman. You only have to enjoy from my victory. You don't love her, then? To give what you love, is there a purer joy for an honest man? Guillaume, you are a libertine! I am what I am! With my qualities and my faults! Come on, I count on you to not much disappoint her. Think of me. And don't forget that our reputation is at stake. I'll do my duty to the end. Do you remember all I said? I know the lesson by heart! Chapter Le Mouche, chapter Marquis... The chapter Marquise, is something else! At home, you'll find... - I know. I'll find your patterns. Good. Don't feel too out of place. I hope you'll like my house. As to my people... Here is Voltaire! Don't say anything. Let's see if he will recognize me. Amazing! - The voice of the thoroughbred! That's a brother. You see, he has manners No, don't caress him. He only tolerates me. Here is your horse. You'll see, a good chap! Be careful, he's afraid of noise. - Here it is. Well Guillaume, I just have to... I'm a little moved, you know! Come on! No tenderness. Beware. Beware of yourself! No excessive enthusiasm, nor uncontrolled indignation! They would not recognize me. Go! Goodbye, Guillaume. - Goodbye, Julien! Voltaire! How odd, look at that! A donkey on a horse! Count Guillaume! I believed him a better horseman. Yes, but when he mounts the Marquise! It's a patriotic horse! Like us, he's tired of having nobility on the back. He rebels. Bravo horse! Yes, horses with us! But poor young man! Do something, no? Let him break his head first, and then we'll pick up the pieces. Oh no! - Caroline! Hold this, tie him. - Yes. Nothing broken? Can you stand up? Miss, how can I thank you? But you are bleeding! - No, it's just a scratch. You cannot leave in this state. Lean on me. I shall clean your knee. Should gangrene set in! Lean on me. You're not crazy, are you! Get married first, we'll see that later. Tell the priest that I'll be right. At what time will be lunch, then! - Help me then! I can walk by myself, sir! - But no! Obey! It's a long time that French nobility cannot stand upright! And I must sustain it! Long live the nation, in god's name! And long live the bride, sir! Sit down. - Don't worry about me, go get married. Sit down! - Obey her! Sit down! Papa, bring me hot water and salt. Hot water and salt! Show me that knee. It hurts? Yes, a lot, in seeing you waste your time for me. This is your great day! A girl is about to become a woman! So, you coming, my little queen? - There you are! Give me a clean towel. At this rate, we'll never marry. We'll end tonight at bedtime! Here! - Ah, thank you. Give Mr. De Saint Preux something to drink to revive him. - Revive!? Here! What? - You recognized me? - Of course! Who doesn't know Count Guillaume? If they had told me that one day, I would revive an aristocrat! You're lucky, young man, to have met an old soldier like me! An old soldier always spares a wounded enemy. Cheers! Who says I'm your enemy? But it all! Your name, your title, my nobleman! Your friends, sir! You're with the coterie of the Marquis De Vigogne who crushes us with taxes! Who spreads famine. You other fiefdoms, you conjure against the people. I know what I know! My eye is not in the haversack! If I'm hurting you, tell me. No, quite the contrary. It's very pleasant. When I was wounded in the Americas, in '80, there wasn't such a fuss! I served, sure! With Rochambeau, under Lafayette. Lafayette and me,.. we freed Americans from the tyranny of England! We avenged Joan of Arc, dammit! So, you coming? The priest has still a funeral after you! Tell him we're coming. You, go and tell him to be patient. See you soon, my queen. - My queen, my queen! At a republican's house! Pip squeak! Oh, my wreath! Hold it for a second. But I can do by myself! - Remain quiet! Yes, be quiet. She gives the orders, here! After me, of course! Right, Caro? - Yes, papa. Caro, odd name. - Caroline. Yes, but we call her Caro, masculine. I wanted a boy, and her mother gave me a girl. For spirit of contradiction! Women! And then she died right after. Widower and father the same day! You see! All the luck! I had my idea, so I raised her as a boy. Iron hands, steel muscles! Right? - Yes. So, you wanted to give me a girl, you! Look! Thank you, madam! Thank you, Caroline. Well, let's go get married now. Let's take care of serious things! The priest said if you're not there... - Coming, coming. Sir, my turn next time! Long live the nation! I was about to say it, sir! - Come on, let's go. Ah sir, you're glad to see me go. - Well, yes, sir. I wish you to make her happy. - Count me in! Goodbye, Count! - Oh Caroline, you can call me by name. Goodbye, Guillame! Goodbye! And don't fall any more! Come on, the wedding now! Get in line. My wreath! - What wreath? Where did you put my wreath of orange blossoms? Are you sure you gave it to me? - Who else? Come on, go find it! - But where could I have put it? Go, go! Oh my, I swear! As if one could not marry without orange blossoms! Sir, we wondered what had become of you! Lots of things happened! - I know, I know. But what is this outfit? - Well, it's... Frontin! It's the master! My lord! We wondered what had become of you! Lots of things happened! - I know, I know. Count, you are limping? - It's nothing, a fall from a horse. Better that than the cheek! The cheek? But why the cheek? Yes, the left. He bragged to have marked you by sword. Who's "he"? Well, that "he" of La Mouche! He and his thugs stormed the house. Calling it a search. He put his nose everywhere. He even flung me down, my butts are all blue! You won't recognize them! I...er... well, and the pretext for the search? Oh, you won't believe it. He claims you are the Black Tulip! No! - Yes! - The fool! Frontin, hitch up my horses, and prepare my suit. Which one? - Which one? - Yes, sir. Uh, the other, of course! The other! - The last one delivered? - Of course! Well, just as I thought. So, this suit! And I said to hitch up my coach! Sir, you feel bad? - No, but the news so upset me that,.. well, I don't know more where's my room! - Oh, sir! Well, why you staring at me like that? Come on, hurry, hurry! No thanks, I don't need anyone. - But sir! Anyone. Not to dress me nor to undress me. Naughty! Madam. - No! But... - No! Yet ... - No! But yes, I love you. There! Well, be, love me, and say no more! Thus, I'll love you secretly. - And silently. May I hope that someday I can...hope ... Hope what? One night. With you. I'll slap you 2 times, 3 times, 5 times! Oh, madam! What a great and fair idea you have of that night! Thank you for not underestimating the talent of the one who will feast on you. Ah, tell me, my dear La Mouche. You allow, marquise? - Please. I don't know what's expected to open the session! I'm eager to know the intentions of Count d'Artois, me! - Me too! Well then, go tell him! My lord, perhaps we could start? Everyone is there. Excuse me. - Please. It seems to me, lieutenant,.. that we're missing someone, whose presence necessary, to say the least.. And desired. - No, my lord, no. De Saint Preux will not come. Count Guillaume De Saint Preux! What? My dear, there you are. We began to worry about your delay. Sorry. A fall from a horse. Oh, nothing serious. Luckily you didn't fall on your cheek! Left! Indeed, one could have imagined things. You know? - Everybody knows. And you also know that when you came in, La Mouche worried for your absence? La Mouche? Ah, La Mouche! Who just now lost his dream that I am the Black Tulip? Who broke into my house, fractured my secretary and bullied my people? Excess of zeal! Who brags to have branded me. - Excess of imagination. Who slanders me wide mouthed. - Excess of excess! And who at this very minute listens with no reaction, keeping a prudent silence. Excess of modesty! - No! Excess of courtesy! I did not want to interrupt, De Saint Preux. Sir, when you insult a man of honor... Sir, a man of honor never lets himself be insulted. - Sir! - Sir? I want satisfaction, sir! - On the field, please, sir! Come on, gentlemen! - Guillaume, not here! I forbid you to murder my friends under my roof! You say nothing? Do something! Gentlemen, you will fight later. Your blood belongs to the king! La Mouche, down there! Down there! I entrust him to you, madam. In your hands,.. he can only expect pleasant things. Gentlemen, take place. I'll give you knowledge.. of the message of His Royal Highness, Count d'Artois. Why all these days without giving me a sign of life? I was so anxious! I needed to be alone. With whom? - With myself! Me too, I needed to be alone. With you! At least tell me that you love me. Good news, gentlemen: Versailles has finally decided to act.. and do away with the rascals of the Third State. If God is with us, and he has always been with us,.. July 11 at the earliest and July 14 at the latest,.. the National Assembly will be dissolved,.. the king restored in his powers,.. and the people will be suppressed by decree. All bloody fools! Pass this scum to the sword and forget about it! Long live the Queen! - Long live! Now here is what concerns us in particular. At this very...moment... Come into the little red lounge. It's more tranquil. No, I'm fine here. At this moment, an army of mercenaries commanded by the Prince of Grasillac.. is heading on Paris to strangle the revolution in the bud. Good! - Good, yes! We will have, for our part, the great privilege to host prince Grasillac,.. if, coming from the south at the head of his brave troops, he will stop.. for a few hours in our city, yes gentlemen,.. before melting on the Capital! Little bastard! Excuse me, my injury. - Oh, it is excused. But, if you feel bad... Madam! Show De Saint Preux to the little red lounge. No, it's useless. The pain is gone. So after tomorrow, De Grasillac will be our host. We should, above all,.. ensure his safety and that of his regiment. Are you listening, Lt General of Police? It's a great opportunity for you to arrest suspects and ... why not, do away with the Black Tulip. Confide in me, my lord. The region will be combed through. And as for the Black Tulip, I will tear his last petals. A figure of speech. Baron. - Yes, what? - For you. - Good. What's this? Do you mind? Indeed, since days, the Black Tulip has disappeared from circul... What! Who dares! Who do you think it is? Come! - No. My dear love, come! Lombard, on the way. Let's go back. But...but... Lombard! Where are you off? Are you crazy? Turn around now! Lombard! Stop! Police! So, where are we, idiot? Where do you lead me? To the tip of my sword, where you'll be soon! The Black Tulip! En garde, mister La Mouche! Raise your head! Your head, I said! To the right! Your cheek, right now, your cheek. No, not this one. The left. There! We're even. Thank you. Come on, whip, coachman! Reconduct your master, and put him to bed with a good hot-water bottle! Goodbye, La Mouche! Dry yourself well! Stop! Stop! Police! So you almost ran over me earlier? And you, inside! Oh, but, it's him! Guards! The man with the scar! What's all this shouting? At attention! We have our orders. You have a scar, yes or no? Well? - These orders come from me. I am your Lt. General! You hear? Your Lieutenant General of Police! And I'm the Cardinal of Rohan. Come on, seize him! But I tell you that I'm your Lt. General of Police, La Mouche! But of course! You'll explain to him! I'll smash you, I'll break you! Quieter, or I'll kick your ass, scarface of my butt! Come on, come on! Take care of Voltaire. Already here? I was eager to see you again... - You limp? It's nothing. What's happening to us is terrible! What, we are unmasked? - No, rest assured, all went fine. You could say it right away! I can breathe now! I just paid my debts, and returned to La Mouche his scar! So, tell me. The marquise? Charming, huh? Oh, la marquise... - Well, she interests me, that bitch! How was her little red lounge? She did show it to you, right? Did she honor my merits? If you think I had this in mind after hearing the marquis! They will suppress the National Assembly,.. kill the Third State and slay our friends. An army of mercenaries led by Grasillac heads toward Paris! - No! - Yes! They'll bivouac here! We must prevent them from committing their crimes. Guillaume, I won't leave you. So, what will you do? Well, first, blow up the bridge. - Bravo! And then? Suppress Prince Grasillac. - Wonderful. And then? And then, well, the army thus beheaded,.. it only remains to put it to rout! Mere formality, child's play! Oh, Guillaume! Everything becomes simple and easy with you! And with what lucidity, what coolness,.. you control the situation. - Don't I? Tell me, Julien,.. do you take me for a fool? Seriously. Do you really see me blowing up a bridge to delay the attack of a regiment? You can't imagine I would waste my time on such nonsense! But Guillaume, I don't understand you. Because you're slow-witted and your youth blinds you! I could care less about the people, my boy! I could care less about the King! I don't care about the Third State, or the fourth! Versailles, the court, the people, the queen, the clergy! All in the same sack! And the sack, into the sea! I live for myself, me. I am a wise man, me! But last night ... - Last night, I needed you. Your enthusiasm amused me. I entered your game, for game You served me to save my face. Thank you. You can go back. But, when you talked about freedom? Freedom? Freedom is a bone thrown to the people to smash their teeth! So they won't bite! But ... It's not true! Say! It's not true! You don't think what you say! You want to try me! But you've done concrete deeds! When you made disgorge the tax collectors... For the people, but to my benefit! But they believe in you, you can't deceive them! They also believe in God and are not better served! And your legend? - Old wives' stories . Impostor, miserable impostor! I detest you, you hear? I detest you, I despise you, I hate you! Still excessive feelings, huh? Come, calm yourself, my boy. And don't break more my ears with your wailings. Well, no, no and no! Like it or not, you're a hero, you hear a hero! As I said, you take me for a fool. - You'll be a hero in spite of yourself! Come on! - You gave me your place, and I keep it. I'll save your legend, Guillaume! You'll blow up the bridge, you'll suppress Grasillac,.. you'll decimate his regiment... and long live freedom! Long live the nation! The little fool! Capable of being killed for a tulip. Sir? - Yes? There is a young person for you. - Yes? Shall I let her in? - I'm busy, you see? You won't receive her? That's news! I'm another man, you hear? Another man! I liked the first better. - I have other aims than to... with young people! It's over with young people! Over, over, over! The beautiful roses that I picked for you! Forgive me, you are right. And then, it's unworthy of me. Come on, not such a great harm . I will pick others. No, Lisette. No more roses. and no more young people. Will you do an exception for us? Caro! - Yes! Why didn't you tell right away? Caro! Well then, leave us! I bring you back your gloves. How nice, but you needn't come all the way! And, how is ... your horse? He has fully recovered from my fall, thank you. He made you fall at the right time. Yes, I owe you my happiness. Glad to know you happy! Oh, very happy! I'm not married. - Not married? I am such as you left me. Are you disappointed? - No, but,.. a little surprised. After your departure, we quarreled, my future husband and me, about... about... my wreath of orange blossoms. About... your wreath? Of orange blossoms, yes. I had given it to him to care it, and he no longer knew what he had done. He even claimed he never received that wreath! No! - Oh, I was furious! You know how it is, the tone rises,.. a little word leads to a bigger one, this to an insult, then a blow! So... In short, I broke up. I dismissed the wedding! And I found myself at night, all alone in my bed. How much space! What a relief! And all this thanks to you! Thanks! Oh, thanks to me, is saying a lot! And the next day, when I awoke, I had like an illumination. I suddenly recalled that my wreath,.. the wreath that could have been fatal for me... - Well? Move away. Move away and turn! That's not here by the work of the Holy Spirit, isn't it? - Well... And then, do like me, smile! Ultimately, it is a blessing! And that poor boy! - Jean-Pierre? We've never been better friends! Yes but, he'll curse me. He knows nothing. He's still looking for my wreath. For the honor. He has his whole life to find it. And have you told your father the story of this wreath? But if he knew it, you'd be a dead man! If he knew me here, in the landmark of a despot! Yes! I think he'd kill you for good standing! With his temper!... He'd be wrong! I'm not his enemy! Far from it! And me too I aspire to more freedom! - Oh, no! You kidding me, huh? For you aristocrats, freedom is part of your privileges. One day you'll repent for having ill-judged me! Yes! I cannot tell you anything yet. But look at this sword, Caro. It is loyal! Yes, loyal! And so much the worse, damn! Come what may! Look at me well Caro. I dare you to guess who I am. Well then, I am ... A clumsy! It was a warning, there! I can say nothing more. But keep this secret to yourself. I put it aside for later. I'm very eager to know it! Here, I'll still give you a pledge of good faith. I think your father leads a clandestine activity in the country. If that is true, an advice: He must beware! The Marquis wants to set an example. Searches, police measures, traps everywhere. Well, one advice is worth another. Soon the revolution will triumph. So the hunt to the nobles will be open, and that day, you can shelter among us. The right to asylum will be your last privilege. So there, we are even. I won't need it, but thank you from myself. And I am grateful for your kindness. Tell me, Caro, we're both in the mood for generosity! What does it mean? A pact of alliance? I'd like to find you wandering, ruined, abandoned by all! Just for the joy to welcome you and talk as equals, freely. As you are doing right now? If I told you what's in my heart, you'd be surprised! And you'd be there to nurse me, in a wedding dress. Caro! Yes, Guillaume? Caro. Yes, Guillaume. Guillaume! Yes, Caro. Well, you see, we said it all. Are you crying? Me? No, never. My father did not teach me how. I don't know what a tear is. For a woman, it is an excellent defense. I prefer the sword. It's safer! Against a man, a woman, even with a sword, can do nothing! - Really? The first who touches the other's heart has right to a pledge. Such confidence! You speak as if you were sure to win! Whether I give you a pledge or I take it from you, to me it's all the same! En garde, De Saint Preux! You haven't touched a sword since long! Less long than it takes to touch you! Look at that! Too short! Too long! Watch out, beware, watch out! Touché! Voila! You know some blows! - It's a secret bout, a family bout! From a great grandfather, a musketeer called Porthos. Here, I'll teach you! Attack me. Touché! Up to you, now. I attack you, beware! Touché! - Wonderful! We are entitled to one pledge each! You allow me to take mine? - Take anything you like! Well, then I take mine now. Well? What? Well, I think the revolution is over, right? - Oh, not quite! Move away! Let me through! Move it! - But there is nobody! Look! Caro! You here, hmm? In the midst of feudalism. I was sure! So, while I was at the secret session of the committee, you took advantage.. to betray the Third State, you, a Plantin! I didn't betray anyone! - Word of honor! - Silence, corrupter! - But sir! - What? Little rascal, you ask for it! Thy corpse, now! Quick, while it's still warm. God's in a hurry! One moment, Lord. He's coming. No, papa! - You, you'll see your butt bleed! Come on, en garde! But ... But this is my bout! But this is my secret bout! He stole my bout! Where did you take it? - I gave it to him. But, you're crazy! A family jewel! Not at all! It stays with the family, we love each other so, long live freedom! What? - Yes, Mr. Plantin. But never! Me living, never! I forbid you to love him, you hear me? Love takes no orders! - It doesn't ... Ah! Good! If it's so and you take that tone, you'll marry Jean-Pierre, and trotting! She'll marry whoever she likes. We're born free and equal before love! No more class prejudices, we're no longer under Louis XIV! Go practice your tyranny elsewhere! The time of despots is over! We are emancipated! - Oh, that! This, then! Coming here to hear that! So, this is it! The nobility takes all! Our daughters, our secret bouts, and now, our ideas! Here, drink on it. I'm no dupe. I don't believe half of it, young friend! I know your tricks and your ties with Versailles, come on! One question, Mr. Plantin. Should a mercenary army pass by here.. to go to Paris to destroy the National Assembly,.. what would you do? - What would I do? Yes, to stop their march! - Well, I'd ... I'd do.. what I always did, in the 7 Years War, and in America! I'd blow up the bridge! Poof! - And the prince? What prince? - Who commands the regiment! - Well, ... with him ... Him, bang! Well, I would try! Bang! And if necessary, bang, bang, bang! Well, Mr. Pantin, in a few hours, this regiment will camp here. No sir...it can't be true! I was given your secret bout, I deliver you a no less secret news. No loss on exchange. It's a trap or an ambush? It's an outstretched hand. - A...No! Not yet. Caro's hand is not enough for you? You give it to me? - I don't give it, it's you who took it! But! But! Is it ... is it a family memento? Yes, it's a family memento. No, ... no. The other fit you better. Say then. This regiment, when will it come? It will bivouac here tonight. Then the bridge will blow up. Right, Caro? - Yes, Dad! You'll make it blow with what? - With gunpowder! And where will you take it? - Where I'll find it! And you'll find it where? There where I'll take it! Charming welcome. And I hate tomatoes! My lord the Prince Alexandre De Grasillac De Morvan Lebro! Oh, my lord, it is a joy for me.. and a great honor to receive here in our little town,.. an eminent prince in whom the kingdom puts so much hope and confidence! It is indeed a very welcoming city, this yours! I deeply enjoyed the expressions of sympathy, of which I was the object. Sympathy, of which here's a firstling! This is a tomato, fruit of your negligence,.. that could have cost me my life! Versailles, did not entrust you my safety? I supervised personally. I even hanged this morning, as a preventive measure,.. a dozen alleged rioters. They decorate the square, you must have noticed, sir. That I know, this is the 1st time a town is decked out with the day's hung men! Of course, this is a very good attitude. Nevertheless, I'm sorry to have to inform Her Majesty the Queen,.. about the anarchy that reigns in your province. But sir, I no longer have a Lieutenant General of Police! He disappeared! - What are you saying, Mr. Intendant? Yes, he may have been murdered. He received here, the last time we saw him,.. a black tulip of the Black Tulip. Bad omen. You believe to the Black Tulip? - I'm forced to! - The Black Tulip is a myth! The mob commits crimes to blame then an imaginary character. The Black Tulip.. is the red tomato! Darling! Make a wish. Done. I think you'll be satisfied. You've heard that outing? What an affront, oh! You risk your Intendance for this. All for a few pounds of tomatoes! Although, they're very beautiful! - Yes. Dear friend, come with me. It is imperative that you chase that bad memory off the prince's mind. Of course, if Mr. De Saint Preux has no objection. Please, do. - Thank you, sir. Come. My lord, allow me to introduce you the Marquise. Mr. tax superintendent. Naughty! You have not spoken a word all evening. Have you nothing to say to me? - Yes. You must be charming, in bed. As if you didn't know! You are adorable, my angel! Baron la Mouche! Well, Mr. Lieutenant General of Police! Where have you been? - In prison, Intendant. - In prison? How is that? Yes, where threw me some subordinates, jerks, but disciplined! Nice scar! Where did you get that? The Black Tulip! La Tulipe Noire wouldn't dare attack me! No, I was assaulted by some twenty bandits, put to flight after a fight. Modestly, I'll spare you the story. You can read it on my face. During that time, sir... During that time,.. tomatoes! Yes, tomatoes! That tells you nothing, sir? Tomatoes?! Oh, I know, my lord. My police has well done! We dispersed the mob by bayonet, order reigns! Patrols were dispatched and a courier service is established. I'm keeping watch, sir. I'm keeping watch! So, you watch! Oh, dear! Farewell, madam, farewell! Are you going already? - No, I leave you forever. Forever? - Yes, treacherous and fickle creature! The show you gave me tonight broke my heart. You behaved with that smug as with me! Same smiles, same complacency! Jealous! You're jealous! Thank God! Yes, you gave me this shameful disease! And I who hoped to reach you in the red lounge! I want nothing else too! Depraved woman! - Oh, yes, sir! - Creature weak and deceptive! - Yes! Right away in the red lounge. - Yes, love, right away! Delighted to get to know you finally! We were stricken by your charm and we would like to endure it again. We are awaiting you in the little red lounge. Come quick, we are impatient. To Prince De Grasillac. - Yes. And bring me my sword, please. For me? Thank you. Do you mind? According to information, there are 200,000 people too many in Paris. 300,000. - 200,000! - No, 300,000! And if the rest will not be more than obedient, simply pass it to the sword. Ah, you. No, thank you. The red lounge? Ah, thank you. Thanks. Thank you. In advance, thank you. Thank you for your gallant summons. I like women who know what they want. It's so agreeable for a soldier to feel besieged in a fortress,.. and just desire to surrender! Surround me! I capitulate! You conquered me without resistance! I arrive in time! How dare you, sir? Who gave you permission to enter, sir? I await your apology, sir. And quick. What apology? Why an apology? On what grounds? By what right? Grounds? Right? I won't be so inelegant to answer these rude questions, sir. Understand my hint! - Hint for hint,.. I am here to become what you flatter yourself to be. You are slandering madam, sir! I won't stand it! That's for your impudence! En garde, sir! Oh, no! Not here! Not here, you'll break everything! Go fight outside! Saint Preux. - Grasillac Morvan Lebro. Delighted. - Me as well. My Mandarin! Oh, my Chinese vase! What are they doing? - You can see that they're fighting! But why? Gentlemen, no carnage at my home! De Saint Preux, I order you to stop the fight! My lord, my lord! Leave me alone! It's about of honor! - So, no relation with you! My duty is done, I'm safe. Where's the prince? This is not the time, he's busy. But I have important news for him! - Go ahead! My lord! - What is he doing here, this one? My lord! - When I'm finished with this nullity! They stole a gunpowder cart! A gunpowder cart? - Completely emptied, my lord. Enough to blow up your castle! With you in it! My castle? But I will not allow it! We must do something! - We are in danger of death. - Oh, do not panic. I placed sentries everywhere, the castle is guarded. Nothing to fear! As to the thieves, insurgents probably, they'll soon fall into our patrols. But it's the Black Tulip who did it. - For sure. And against him you haven't had much luck, so far! The Black Tulip does not exist! Do not put La Mouche on the wrong track. The Black Tulip. The Black Tulip! But I say! A black tulip in my pocket! Lieutenant General! Lieutenant General! - What's going on? The two sentinels at St Peter's bridge: culled and thrown into the water! A patrol found their bodies! - St Peter's bridge! So they bothered someone who wanted to blow up the bridge! With my powder? - Well, very likely. The Black Tulip! This can only be the Black Tulip! Quick, my horse! Take some men and search the forest. I'm going to inspect the bridge and pick the Black Tulip. My lord. Well! Here! And now the two of us, De Saint Preux! De Saint Preux? Where is he? Mr. De Saint Preux? Mr. De Saint Preux?! Come on, let's go! Hurry! Let's go! Go! Okay, put the powder! Gently. Gently! Gently! It's gunpowder! It explodes! Go on. Stop. Be silent! Beware! A horseman! Caro? I'm here! - Quick, Caro! Have you killed the prince? - Not yet, but why do you whisper? Because of the horseman! - Where? Pardon, it was you! How silly of me! Papa, it's Guillaume De Saint Preux! What is he still doing here, this aristocrat? To spy on us, huh? La Mouche is arriving with a detachment to take you by surprise! Well, now we know it! But then, is it true? Because, with you.. Well, that's confidence! I hear a stamping! - Be off! Be off! What, be off! We didn't do all this work for nothing, no? We may blow up with it, but the bridge will blow up! It will, sure, but I'll take care of it. Be off! Be off! I stay with Guillaume. - Ah, no. You, you... Okay, we're going. Rendezvous at the St Blaise crossroads! Alright! - Yes! A good start, the two of us, huh? Watch out! Follow me! Bravo! That's a thing well done! Men, I am pleased with you! And your prince, when do we bury him? - When I'll kill him, Mr. Plantin! You haven't yet? I was going to, but the plans of La Mouche made me rush to warn you. Okay, and now? Now the party must be over at the castle. - Yes, so what? So the prince will return to camp. - So? So, you lack imagination Mr. Plantin! Follow me! What's going on? There. Must get off. Well, go see what it is! So, why did you stop? There is a man. - What man? On the road. - So what! Pass over. But it is a woman. Will it last long yet? But what's my coachman doing in your arms? Caro, the gun! Here! Ah, I got you this time! Oh, De Saint Preux! What are you doing in my coach? I'm abducting you, see? - But I forbid you! Oh, no! I don't like my servants into my coach. - Silence, or I'll shoot. OK, I'll keep quiet, but you will pay for this! We arrived! Come on! Everybody down! Hey, you have the key? - Here it is. Boss, bring the aristocrat. This is the ideal place, it has all it takes to make a custom coffin! A sawmill! What have I to do in a sawmill? It's indecent. This way. Pray you, sir. After you. You, I forbid you to be polite! Judas! Eery! A real den of cutthroats! You can say that again! Oh, so it's a snare? - No, this is not a snare. We do not take you treacherously. We will condemn you to death. That's all! Tomorrow morning, you won't even think about it! The people murders its princes. What an age! Yes! It's the world upside down! But, joking aside. We will not keep you here all your life. How would you like to die? Choose your own death. - Is this a joke? No. I will not be your accomplice in the assassination of my own person! I insist. - You offend me! So, obviously we can do nothing to be... agreeable to you? - Yes! One question tickles me. What was that stupid comedy with the Marquise? I explained myself with her. The note was from you! A pretext, to kill you! - Kill me? Why? You do not know me! To prevent your regiment to cause harm. An army without a leader is a moonless night! And that's why you invented this idiotic mess? I wanted to kill you with no apparent political cause. Kill without being unmasked. - Unmasked? - Yes. I can tell you, whose discretion I cannot doubt anymore! I am ... No. Her, first! Guillaume, Guillaume! It's wonderful! Papa! Papa! Well, gentlemen, I am the Black Tulip! It's ... Tul ... My general! The Black Tulip? But this changes everything! The Prince of Grasillac Morvan Lebro killed by the Black Tulip. But we'll write a page of History! My glory is assured! Gentlemen, let's toast to the Black Tulip and to his latest victim! Hosanna! I will long remember my last day! To life! To death! Who's there? - Baron La Mouche, Lieutenant General of Police. Oh chief, what happened? What I had expected. The bridge blew up. Well, what are you waiting for? Give me a horse, a uniform, a sword! Let's see your officer, make it snappy! Uh, no,.. not so snappy! Come on, get off, you! Come on, come on! Quick, quick! Your pants! Come on, your boots, you! To my last morning! And now, drunk enough. Mors ultima ratio! I have lived more than reasonable. Farewell, life! Farewell, love! Farewell, Plantin! Farewell, little Plantin! Farewell, my dear prince! Well, where are you going there? - To the ordeal! I want to die like Mary Stuart. I carry my own log! Do not forget your ax! I can't! I can't! I can not do that to you, my man! We can not do that to him! To him? Do that to him? No, we can not! I Want to die! - No! Be kind. Take your ax. No! No ax, there! Plantin? - Géneral? Oh, my poor little Plantinet! What happened to you? - So, is that better, drunkard? Yes, general! Come on, shoo! To the ordeal, Mary Stuart! Come!- No, there may be another way to save him. - Save him? You're going to sign this delegation of power on behalf of Plantin. Gra-Si-llac! What did I just sign, Tulip? - Your grace, idiot! - My grace idiot? Lock him up there! - Onward! Come lock me up, little Plantinet! - Hey, no familiarity, aristocrat! Plantin? Take his hat and cape. He's kind, Plantinet! - Hey! Look, the coach of the Prince of Grasillac! Present, sabers! The Prince of Grasillac! Quick, muster! On horseback! - On horseback! Attention! Present, arms! Present, arms! Where is the officer on duty? It's me, sir. - Not sir, colonel! Delegation of power signed by colonel Prince Grasillac Morvan Lebro. From now on you're under my orders. - But sir, I ... - Not sir, colonel! The prince's orders are explicit! No more Paris, go down on Marseilles. But sir... - Not sir, colonel! Back in the ranks! But sir... - Back in the ranks! Oh, well! Attention! On my command! Right flank! Right! Toward Marseille! Forward, march! One, two! One, two, one, two ... Go! There! They won't be in Paris on July 14 those! Ah! Chief, it worked! Look! But it's Saint Preux! It's my Saint Preux! This time, I got you! But they are at least four. Go look for reinforcement, so we can surround them. Take eight men. You, there. Me, here. Eight men with me! ...and they have all gone, as one man! One, two, one two! By the way, and Prince bloodthirsty, still there? What do we do, chief? We keep him as a hostage, in the shack. Nobody will ever look for him here. You're right, chief, there is no safer place. Hey you! Come have a snack! Hey, we're going to have a bite. - It wouldn't hurt! I'm getting one of those cravings! Manzin, watch out! Watch out Chief! Plantin! - Thanks! Go! In the name of the king, open! In the name of the king... Withdraw to the cabin! Safe! Bring the prince, serves us as hostage. Luckily we have him as a bargaining chip, that one! Hey, Chief! He's gone! How, gone? - Yes! Too bad! Close! The swine! Look at him there with La Mouche! Oh, my lord! I was sure you were here! Come now! I freed myself alone! Congratulations sir,.. for your outfit, and your security service! After the tomato, I was kidnapped, sir! I was kidnapped, sir! And you know by whom, sir? By Saint Preux! And you know who he is? The Black Tulip! Yes, sir! I give you this news! - I knew it, sir. I need to join my regiment! I promised the king to be in Paris within July 14. Are you at least capable to give me an escort? - Right away, sir! 4 men with me! We need reinforcements. Yes, but how? We are surrounded, we're stuck. No way out! And that one, up there! That? A needle hole! So try to go through that! - Me, I can easily. Not you Caro! Here or outside, risks are the same! Come on, do me a leg up. - But really! Come on, chief! If we must get killed, let it be in the open air! Caro, take this! Onward! Guillaume! Guillaume! Guillaume. Where is Guillaume? Oh, Caro, what are you doing here? - Where is Guillaume? They took him away, with your dad. Here is! They locked up your brother! They tried him with Mayor Plantin! - What? They sentenced Plantin to life imprisonment,.. and your brother will be hanged tomorrow morning. - Hanged? - Yes. They only talk about this, in town! Since they knew you're the Black Tulip,.. one stumbles over your widows! And all pissing tears! Ah, to be regretted this! And they'll hang him. When one makes the fool, one always ends up being fooled. Finally, here we are in peace. It only remains to decamp. No more patrols to fear! He was a child. - We must act quickly! You never know. If he cracked under torture it would be the end for both of us! Come on, come on! Come, quick! A child a bit crazy. Full of chimeras. And tomorrow, we will be in Spain. To us, beautiful wenches! We're not leaving. We stay. - What? Are you crazy? - We stay, Brignolle! - Why the hell? - Brignolle! Oh no, you stay if you want, but I go! And nobody will prevent me from going! Nobody! Already that your brother stinks of carrion! - Brignolle! No. No! Guillaume! I knew it! Lets talk later! Saw the bar there. Yet I would tell you... One more word and I'll saw your tongue. Here. Go, go! Pull! Alert the guard! Alert the guard! - Go away! A prisoner has escaped! You see, Julien. I'm not used to good deeds. And God punished me. Get the hell out! Don't worry, I won't leave you! Idiot! Come on, go! A final word, Julien. Do never part from Voltaire, my best friend. Take good care of him. It's a good horse. Here, it's yours now. Come on, get the hell! No, Guillaume. I stay! Get the hell. Get the hell out, I say! Farewell, Guillaume. Farewell, Voltaire. Ah, family! My scar! He has my scar! Idiot! Come on, take him! Aren't you a little upset? - Why should I be upset? A man who deceived us all! As far as I'm concerned, I do not regret him. No one is irreplaceable. Did you see my scar? He has my scar. It suits him very well. Guillaume! Murderers! Murderers! Guillaume! I don't want anyone to kill you! I don't want! Oh, that's indecent! Arrest that girl at once! Guillaume! I love you! I love you! Guillaume! I'll never know who is this charming person. But look here! - Hang him, I say! Hang him! Hang him! - What they're waiting to hang him! There. There! Very well! Very well! Finally, here we are tranquil! Mr. Lieutenant Général,.. I want to thank you on behalf of all. You have accomplished quite a feat! What a great day for you, isn't it? And for him then! His final! I admit I'm pretty happy. Pity we can't offer every day dead of such quality! It's not party every day! So long, count. - Goodbye. Shall we go see him, huh? - Let's go see him! Your masterpiece, my darling. - Oh yes. If I think... - All women make mistakes, but I'll help you forget yours. How well he swings at the end of his rope! Yes, you'd say he's done it all his life! Oh, my darling. Yes, of course, it was wrong not to take this opportunity to hang this Plantin. The arrest of his daughter constitutes a new fact, so why not execute them both? They did not even hesitate to bombard the Prince of Grasillac with tomatoes... Where is he? But where are you? My lord the Prince Alexandre De Grasillac De Morvan Lebro! My regiment! Where is my regiment? Somebody saw my regiment? What, you lost your regiment? - No. It's my regiment that lost me. It evaporated! My lord, give me its description and I'll find it. You won't find anything at all! I got to Paris, alone, in what state!,.. exactly 5 min after the Bastille had been taken! - What? They took the Bastille? And who took it? I will arrest him! The 100,000 Parisians that I should have massacred. Pleasure I was denied! Because your Black Tulip cut me off from my regiment! Yessir! Without him, the Bastille would have never been taken! Never! But for that, you should have arrested him! I arrested him, my lord, and hanged! The Black Tulip is dead. Long live the Black Tulip! And let the party begin! It's not possible! But first, what are you doing up there? That's not your place! And where is my scar? No, but, well ... But I dream! You were there this morning, when he was hanged! There! Well, go and see if I'm there, Mr. La Mouche! Heavens, my husband! Tocsin bells! It's the revolution! Revolution? - Believe me. I just came from it! No sir, it won't take place here! Guards, to me! Guards! Guards! Guards! To him, guards! Guards, to me! Guards! Forward on the Black Tulip! And now, every man for himself! My coach! Where did I put my coach? - You didn't find it? - Ah, there it is! But you're leaving already? Where are you going? I return to my country. A nation at war is not for the military. Then, in memory of the small red lounge, I go with you! - But, but ... Your husband, you can not let him hang there! At the point where he is, we can not do anything for him! We'll weep him together. - With joy! Hubert, on the way! Guards, to me! Guards, to me! I was expecting you, Mr. La Mouche! Him again? This man is the devil! Hang him! Hang him! No! Leave vengeance to the vanquished. They fled. Do not persist against who no longer exists. And let's go free the prisoners! Come on! Let's go! Long live Black Tulip! Long live Black Tulip! To the jail! To the jail! Oh, naughty! Great day! Great Date! They will remember July 19, 1789! Tell me, my dragonfly,.. in your opinion, later on, in history books,.. will they say "The Black Tulip and Plantin",.. or rather "Plantin and the Black Tulip"? Or yet, more modestly,.. "Plantin" only? Bravo, Plantin, bravo! And long live the Black Tulip! You, you! When I think you're still alive, still alive! Guillaume, Guillaume, Guillaume! No, do not call me Guillaume. Call me Julien. What? Why Julien? It's ugly! It doesn't suit you at all! And then, I prefer Guillaume. I do not like Julien. Then let it be Guillaume. But me, I really liked Julien. Poor Julien! - You're a bit crazy, huh? Oh, Guillaume! I'll never tire of calling you Guillaume! Like it or not, you're my Guillaume for life. Hey, look! Ah, there you are, you! Where you been? Why are you laughing like that? - Because him, he knows! He knows what? - Well, ask him, Caroline!
