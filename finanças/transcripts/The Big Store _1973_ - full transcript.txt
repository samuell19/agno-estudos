You'll explain that to the director. The director is going to fire you all. He's going to receive all of you, now. Sir, they are outside. Gentlemen, please, come in. You have been hired to make lawn mowers. But this month you built three motorcycles. But we do not sell motorcycles - In short, we are fired. To be more precise... The motorcycle production will stop. No problem. To make it easy, dear friend, goodbye. Don't worry. You'll find four new guys. No, the clean one. Bye. We wouldn't go too far. Kisses. So, can we kiss goodbye, with a drink? With a drink. Martine, six glasses. I guess, I shook too much. I get another one. Two. - Okey, two. Lets go. Thanks for everything. Goodbye, Martine. We'll call you sometime. Keep an eye on your team boss. He's an asshole. Good evening, my friends. You came early today . Everything all right? No, on the contrary. - As always? No. A big glass of water for me. - For me, too. What's wrong with you? The boss gave us champagne. - To the whole factory? No, just to us. - Good news? Yes, he fired us. - Fired you? Why? We couldn't get along. Was a crazy day. That's not the end of the world. Fortunately, we still have our parents. And they're counting on us. How are we going to tell them? Get me some peanuts, please. And some alcohol to sink your sorrows. There's plenty of work around. Here in the neighbourhood? - Sure. During the day, you see nobody. Only women. The children are in school. They do shopping, the domestic chores. Then, they get upset.... You could make this place, a tea shop. Not all women who do not work, like tea. Don't tell that to anybody. If there are no men, we work for them. What kind of work? - Any kind. 'Do you need anyone to fix this?' 'Do you know who can do deliveries?' Any kind of work, so. A lot of work, get ready. You have some talent. - And we, no? I didn't say that. I have something for you. And you do well. And what is it? - Apartment renting agent. Because this is far, the sales agents are not around. The porters show the apartments. But that's not their jobs. If there's someone in the place, it would be, then... Number 3. There it is... You come to see the apartment? - Oh, are you...? - Yes. Good morning. - Good Morning. This is the building. It's modern, isn't it? Your apartment is on the top. It has a great view. Is there an elevator? - Yes, there is. But it's out of order right now. Do you want me to carry the bear? - No, because it falls all the time. Here is your apartment. I live here. It's that one there. Here is the apartment. You're the first tenants. It's really brand new. The living room is enormous. Here is the bedroom. No, sorry. It's the washroom. But it's big, isn't it? - Yes, it is. Ideal for children's double deck beds. They would never be quiet. A kitchen totally equipped. With an automatic garbage shoot. Very convenient. You throw it in and ... You put it in there and automatically goes down. Good engeneering, hey? Here, is a big closet. Can't be like that, we want to sleep. Let us sleep. They're for the maintenance. But once you move in, they will be out. What about heating? - Is on the ground. - Heating on the ground? Works perfectly well. Safe and clean. And the window opens all the way. The control for the blind is here. This is crazy. - We won't open the window completely. A bit will be enough. I'll show you how it works. That's perfect. - Yes. And there is a kindergarten. Yes? Where? I'll show you. - It can't be too far. There it is. In a parking lot. Isn't that dangerous? In the park, the cars are stopped. This is the best place, right? It makes sense. And the walls are soundproof? - Absolutely. You'll never know you have neighbors. Ah, Mrs. Loney Have problems with your car? I can't really go. I can't leave now. But I'll send you someone. He's a specialist. If he works for you, You'll never want another. Press on the clutch. - What? - Press on the clutch. The clutch. Good. Are you ok? Where is my parts? Start the car. Accelerate. Harder. Even harder. What a stunning thing is, this car. - Shut up. Shut up! And that's not all. There is a room. It's the water chamber. So. Will you take the apartment? Are you showing the apartments? No, no. It's the doorman. Do not use the elevator to make deliveries. But it is the twelfth. - Even if is the first... That's the rules. - Oh yeah. The rules.

What are you doing here? - I came here by accident. Follow me. If he can do it, so can we. - No, Marcel. Is there any one else? It's not easy, isn't it? - No. It's my colleague. He's going to try too. He's just a rookie. He's not very good. What do we do now? We continue. I'll count to ten. Let's go. Jean, Jean-Guy, Phil and for me. Take off your hands. Not bad for amateurs, huh ? For amateurs, not bad, what about your parents? We'll say there's a strike. - We have many shortcomings. And the deficit is greater because there were many losses. A TV, 150 bottles of wine, various fines,... repairs,... Here's the bill. I thought I had received more money. We will have to work the double, to pay. That's going to be hard. We really had no luck. - I have an idea. And if we steal money from ?mile's box. Good idea . ?mile , we need to steal money, from your box. I'll show you something. Come here, Jean. One night, a boy asked me a box of cheese. So, I turned around, and he tried to rob me. Give it a try. - A box of cheese. We won't touch the money. - For sure. In the 20 years that I'm here, just one person entered my registration robberies. And several times. - Who? The tax collector. You've been here for 20 years? - A bit longer. In the beginning there was no apartments here, only a few small houses. On Sunday evenings, we would dance in the yard, in the woods. Do you still participate in motocross competitions? No, I stopped a few years ago and in full glory. I used to ride on a 500 cc. I made all the big competitions. I never fell. That's why I'm known. I was brilliant. Practiced every day. I had the legs full of strength. During a contest on the coast, my rear wheel locked. Went off the road and fell on top of a tree. Not even a scratch. Absolutely nothing. Terrific, isn't it? Crawled out of the tree and ploffff... The engine fell on top of me . - Damn!!! Six months in the hospital. - Stupid, huh . So I came here . And I 'm not leaving here, because... What is ? What the... ? GRAND OPENING TOMORROW, EUROMARCH? Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Euromarch? is pleased to open a new store. Within moments , our director will cut the ribbon.

They do this for so long that they don't count the money anymore. It is very easy. We just have to attack . - It's too risky. He's right. - We need more information.

Can I say something before we go? - Yes , please. In ten days is Easter. No. Here is a genius plan These guys get a tank and rob a bank.

Then entering hidden in the truck to the store. I have another one, for just two guys. We go to the store as ordinary customers. We will get dressed in the WC. - Can't we get dressed somewhere else? And exit the WC as... ..warehouse workers. We enter the store through the front door discreetly. Once you discover two people dressed like you, get the carts. You open the back door and the people collecting the money will show up. Give them 5 bags of paper, they'll think they got the money and will leave. Then put your stockings in the head, get the money that the employees have... and show them your guns. I didn't understand. - Our guns? - Our guns. Our guns. They're here. I won't use this. - Don't worry. They're Japanese toys. It's fake, I do not take risks. - But we also do not take risks. You lock the employees in the freezer, and flee.
