(dramatic music) (moving to lyrical orchestral music) (train whistle tooting) (train rumbling) (train whistle tooting) - Where are we anyway? - I couldn't say precisely. The mountains. - Yeah? That what they are? (train rumbling) I must've been out of my mind when I let you talk me into this. "Michael, old boy, what's the hurry this year? "Let's go down by train, make a bit of a holiday of it. "See, some scenery." This bird must be taking us by way of Bulgaria to see his mother-in-law or something. - Lovely little country, Bulgaria. I went there on a photographic assignment once, '52. Met a charming little thing. She had an extraordinary name. Mushka, Mushka. - Hmm. (train whistle tooting) (train rumbling) - 'Tis your move, isn't it, Mike old boy? I moved my knight to queen's three yesterday. (train rumbling) (metal clanking) (wind whistling) (train rumbling) (train whistle tooting) (tracks clattering) - I could do with a Schnapps, how 'bout you? - Mmm hmm. (buzzer buzzing) (train rumbling) - [Guard] Hey, hey! (gate clattering) What was that? - I think we just crashed the sound barrier. (gun firing) - [Guard] Hello, hello, Herr Koerner. Quickly. (phone ringing) - Commandant Koerner speaking. - [Guard] Are you expecting a train? - What? - [Guard] A train. - Expecting what? - [Guard] A train. - No, no, of course not. Why should we be expecting a train this afternoon? There hasn't been the train to Gudavia in five years. It's against government policy. - I know, I commanded it to stop. But, it refused. - It must be stopped. Herr Boronski will be furious. (train rumbling) (buzzer buzzing) - Don't know what you have to do to get a drink around here, send up rockets? - Typical continental service. (somber music) - What is it, Mark? - A train is coming. - A train? A train is coming! A train is coming! Hans, Anna, quickly, quickly, get everything ready. Get the covers off. Get the rooms ready. Hans, the fire, the boiler for hot water. A train is coming! - What did he say? - He said the train is coming. (train rumbling) (somber music) - [Guard] (mumbles) Right hand. (train wheels squeaking) Schmidt. (buzzer buzzing) - That joker must be dead. (door clattering) Passport. - [Howard] Quite. - How's chances of getting a drink, Captain? Are we gonna be here long enough? (speaking in a foreign language) I'll go look myself. (track bells ringing) Hiya fellas. You got a bar around here? - [Koerner] Commandant Koerner. - How do you do? Mike Wilson. What's the celebration? - [Koerner] Celebration? - Yeah, what is this, sort of a festival or something, native costumes and everything, a... Well, now don't do that, will you, buddy. I got a very nervous stomach. - [Howard] Well, hello. (chuckles) - Don't you see? We're on assignment to cover the music festival at Salzburg. We do it every year. Usually we fly down but-- - Hello, had a tea going? What's the snack, Mike? - I don't know, I don't get it. - [Koerner] I must ask you to state your business in Gudavia. - Come again, Commandant. Where? - Gudavia. You are now in Mitiling, the capital of Gudavia. - Well, you got me. I mean, where the heh, uh, where is Gudavia? - Must be one of those sort of buffer states. - [Koerner] This is Gudavia here. - This is Gudavia. Well, I never heard of it. - Huh, Gudavia. Well, I can't seem to see it here. - I must insist-- - Look look look, don't don't don't get in a spin about anything. I mean, we're a couple of working newspaper men that's all. And, we wanna get to Salzburg. Now, if you don't want us here, just say so and we'll get back and wait in the train until it leaves. There's no problem. - What train? - Why the... (dramatic music) What happened? - [Koerner] Luggage. - I have't a clue. Was there last time I looked. Huh, there's something very odd going on here. No train and, what's more, no Gudavia. - The kingdom, the democracy of Gudavia, gentlemen, although quite small, lies just to the southwest of, to the southwest of uh. Anyway, you've no right here at all. - Now, just a moment. Mr. Wilson is an American subject. - Citizen. - Uh, citizen. And, I am British. - British. - Yes, by birth. And, if you think for a moment-- - That is enough. Come. - Come? Oh top that. - Just a minute, relax, play along with him. I'll get in touch with the American consul and get this comic opera character straightened out. - Yes, right you are. And, I'll get on to our chaps, come (mumbles). (somber music) Extraordinary. No American consul. What's more, no British consul either. We're a bit incommunicado then, wouldn't you say? - Yes, yes, I would say that. - [Howard] Extraordinary. - Howard, you're repeating yourself. - Oh, sorry. It 'tis extraordinary. (dramatic music) (machine rumbling) - Today we'll be approaching the point of maximum impregnation of the subjects rising to 300,000 units. - But, is it possible to foretell the results beyond their limits? (machine thudding) - Certainly not. - It's a great risk we are taking then. - Science is a series of risks. All therapy eventually reaches a point of no return. Just enough and we have what we want. A little too much and consider that only 3/10 of a degree may make all the difference between genius and nothing. - [Paula] You mean, idiots. - A thing without a mind is nothing, an unfortunate failure. - There have been too many. - [Man] Herr Koerner is on the phone again, sir. He insists he must speak to you. - Herr Koerner insists, does he? (door hissing) (door clanking) What is it, Koerner? - [Koerner] Herr Doctor, a train has arrived. - [Boronski] A what? - [Koerner] A train. - [Boronski] Well, don't bother me about it here. Send it back wherever it came from. - [Koerner] I'm afraid there may be some risk, Herr Doctor. I suspect the two passengers, an American and an Englishman, of being spies. - [Boronski] What makes you think they are spies? - Half a train with no engine arriving suddenly. - [Boronski] You've taken precautions. - [Koerner] Naturally, the best of precautions. I have them both in jail and-- - [Boronski] In jail? You're a blundering idiot, Koerner. You can't put an American and an English journalist in jail. Take them out immediately. - [Koerner] You mean out of Gudavia? - [Boronski] No, of course not, not out of the country. You're probably wrong as usual, but let's be sure. Make a fuss of them. Do everything possible. Tell Lochner to do the same. Perhaps I'll see them myself tomorrow. (door hissing) (door clanking) (lively music) - (laughing) A misunderstanding, gentlemen. Of course it was all a misunderstanding. Will you accept my apology? - Sure, forget it. - I give you the freedom of Gudavia. I give you the keys of the city. We have arranged a suite at the hotel. - Just see if you can arrange for a car so that we can get outta here. - Oh, I'm so sorry, but that is not possible. - Why not? - There is no car. - They have no cars here. - Ah, we have one, yes. But, it is engaged at the moment on official business. - Where's the telegraph office? - Just here. As a matter of interest, gentlemen, we are now in the King Ferdinand Plaza, named after our late king. - Look here, if you don't mind, perhaps you could show me just where Gudavia is. - Would you go in there and shoot a wire to the office and tell them where we are? - But, Mike-- - Look, we may be on a newer map or something, I don't know. Will ya? - Right. - Fine. I'll get to the hotel. - This way, please. - [Lochner] Welcome. - Hans, quickly, the luggage. Is the room ready, Herr Lochner? - Yes, Herr Colonel. - This gentleman and his friend are to be made as comfortable as possible during their stay. - Sure. - Um, you think you may make it by tonight? (all laughing) - Well now, if you will just sign for yourself and your friend. Herr Lochner, what room are we giving them? - The bridal suite. - The uh-- - Uh, it has the best view and the best bed such as it is. - Just so it's a bed. We're not gonna be here long enough for it to matter. (Lochner chuckles) - Uh, how much will that be? - Oh there's no charge, sir. - Oh, no charge at all? - No, sir. - Oh, that's very decent of you. Thank you very much. Oh, when will that be delivered in London? - It won't be delivered, sir. - I beg your pardon. - It won't be delivered. - Oh, why not? - There's no telegraph service here, sir. This office is open only for the convenience of important visitors on special occasions. That's why there's no charge. (paper ripping) - [Koerner] And, your passports. - Oh, thank you. - [Koerner] Now you must excuse me. But, if there is anything further I can do to assist you, I am at your service. - What about the car? - Oh, as I have explained-- - Look, I heard the explanation. We have work to do in Salzburg. We have to get outta here, so get us a car. - But, I don't think-- - Look don't argue with us, just get us a car unless you want some publicity on that crummy jail of yours. - I assure you that I will do the best I can. (lively piano music) Anna, show this gentleman to his room. - Take it easy, I'll wait. - Oh, hello there. (speaking in a foreign language) Definitely. Say, Mike-- - Shh shh shh. - Just had this peculiar experience. - Anna, how long will the two foreigners stay? - I don't know. - There's something I want you to do for the future of Gudavia, for the children, Anna. Give them this note, but please, say nothing. I have not been here. - Stop! Repeating your mistake does not correct it. - Excuse me. - [Hugo] Music is a precise configuration, not a sentimental noise. - Hugo, it-- (girl crying) (dramatic music) - That was very interesting, Hedda, but this is not a time to improvise an emotion exposing your frustration to do Bach! - I want to play what I feel. (dramatic music) - Hugo, I want to talk to you. - Kindly do not interfere. In future, I want you to play the music as it is written. Take her away now please. - What a little stinker. (orchestral music) - Well, I've seen some things in my time... - I will show you to your room now if you are ready. - Oh, thank you, thank you very much. Yes, yes, I'm ready. I say, Mike, you don't suppose we'll have to stay over here for a bit, do you? - Not a chance, I'll have us outta here in the morning if I have to start an international incident. Did you send the telegram? - Oh, yes, well-- - Look, Lothario, did you send the telegram? - Oh yes, but it won't be delivered. - Come again. - You see, there's no telegraph service here. - But, the office was open. - But, only on special occasions. It's all right, they didn't charge me. As I say it won't be delivered. - You sent it but it won't be delivered. Why? - Why, he tore it up. - [Mike] I've seen everything. Carry me over the threshold, Mike. - [Mike] Oh, um, here, here you are, you go lie down for a little while. - Thank you, sir. Welcome to Gudavia. I will speak to Herr Breja tomorrow. He will arrange about the skis. - Are we staying long enough for that, Mike? - No! - We have wonderful skiing here and we have excellent snow. And, we have wonderful mountains, but no one to climb them. - Yes (chuckles). - The beer is very good, too, but no one to drink it. I will speak to Herr Breja tomorrow about the skis. - And, speak to him tonight about the beer. - [Mike] I don't believe I caught your name. - Anna. - Anna, oh what a pretty name. (Mike chuckles) I wonder if you could direct us to a moderately-priced little restaurant, Anna. Or perhaps we could have supper here at the hotel. - No, there is nothing at the hotel. - Oh, but I'm sure you could find a little something. - What? Hey! Kinda big hurry. Must be the bill. - Why, it can't be. Already? Well, it might be for me. After all, very shy girl. She may have decided to act through an intermediary, so to speak, hmm. Good heavens. What's all this about? Sounds like a revolutionary crank. - You figure it out. Operator. - You must help us. The situation is desperate. Our children must be saved. Dr. Boronski must be destroyed. No signature. Well, it doesn't make sense, does it? - Completely cockeyed. Operator. - Well, who's Boronski? - Operator, hello. No operator, operator. Well, did you have a nice holiday? No, skip it, look, I wanna place a call to London. It's urgent and it's personal. Yeah, London, England, a Mister... Why not? Well, why can't you? All right, gimme long distance. Gimme Berlin, gimme Munich, gimme Zurich, gimme somebody, I'll figure it out myself and I... Why doesn't it? No, I don't wanna talk Commandant Koerner. I've already talked to the phony. Of all the screwy places I've ever gotten into. (woman screaming) (dramatic music) - [Woman] Werner, Werner! (crowd shouting) Werner, Werner! (somber music) - What happened, Pop, what happened? - In the end the murdering will cease. - Murder? - In the end the murdering will cease. - Let's take a look outside. - In the end the evil will be punished. - Gentlemen. - Well, Koerner, what is this all about? We were just-- - Nothing gentlemen. It is nothing. - Nothing? These people are pretty upset about nothing. - Oh, hysteria. A little hysterical outburst that-- - The old chap, Hans, seems to think there's been a murder or something. - Oh Hans, of course, you will understand, he's an old man. He has fantasies. One of our poor burghers met with a little accident. That is all. - What happened to the poor burgher? - As I say, it's an accident. I was just on my way to bring you both good news. - You got a car for us. - Ah well, no, not yet. I'm working on that. At the moment I have the honor to inform you that Herr Boronski will see you in the morning. - Will he? Who's Boronski? - I beg your pardon. Herr Boronski, gentlemen, is Gudavia's most celebrated citizen and educator, a most distinguished man. A most distinguished man. - Well, that's fine, only this trip we won't have enough time. - No, cheerio. - Herr Boronski suggests about 9:30 at the castle. - Well, we'll let him know. - I will call for you here at 9:00 precisely. (heels clicking) - I wonder who makes his hats. - [Howard] Completely deserted. (footsteps clattering) - Well, almost deserted. - Shocking manners. Must be a pack of the local Teddy boys. (church bell ringing) Extraordinary place this. - Mmm. - No life, no love. - Mmm. - No nothing. - Mmm. - Ah, this looks a bit more promising, Mike. Hello. Hello in there. Are you open for business? (curtains clattering) Oh. Maybe he misunderstood me. You know, Mike, (ominous music) I had an experience like that once before in a remote village in the north of Scotland. (chuckles) It was very funny really. I... Perhaps. I think you want, you want Mike. We're looking for a nice little restaurant. Nothing, nothing too fancy, rare price, you know. (man grunts) You know one? (man grunts) Beg your pardon. (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) Carnival? (speaking in a foreign language) Mike! (whistle tooting) (dramatic music) Mike! Mike, Mike, Mike. - What happened to you? I thought you were right behind me. What, what? - Mike, I just, just, just on me. He was standing right behind me. Then a whole crowd of them. - Look, will you relax, I mean, I've got enough problems. Don't you go psycho on me. - Mike, I, no I saw them. - Okay, okay, you saw what? - I saw a man, an ordinary man, but somehow different. - You said a crowd. - Yes, yes, they all looked the same. - Now, wait a minute, they all looked the same, the man looked different. Are you sure you know what you're talking about? - (panting) Yes, yes, they looked like, you know, ordinary men, but without minds, soulless, goons. - Howard, Howard, you're a little overtired. Been a long day. Now, let's get back to the hotel. - No, now Mike, Mike, we won't be able to leave here tomorrow. - You can say that again unless I can build a fire under that majordomo, now come on. - There's a lot we have to do before we leave. - Come on. - I think I'd like to have a talk to that girl Anna. There, there, there now. Don't be frightened, Anna. We aren't gonna hurt you. We just want to ask you a few questions. We're your friends, Anna. - Let me go please. - Look, look, you're wasting your time. I'll stir up Happy Jack and see what he's done about a car. - Now, tell me, Anna, who asked you to give us this? - Please let me go. I don't know anything. - Now, Anna, come along. Well, don't you trust me? - No, I don't trust anybody. Besides, what good would it do with poor Herr Bickstein dead already? (gasps) (dramatic music) - Oh, he's the one who gave you the note for us. An hour later he's dead. So, there was a murder. - Help, please, I didn't mean to say that. Oh, let me go. You'll get me into a problem with Dr. Macklin. Boronski. - Leave her go. (dramatic music) - Charming girl. - Macklin, Dr. Macklin. - See, it's obvious. - Macklin, I know that name. It rings a bell. (phone ringing) Macklin. - There's one ringing now. - Oh. Hello. What? Speaking, who is this? Oh Koerner, I been trying to get in touch with you. Yeah, why don't you stay in your office instead of parading around in that stupid uniform. (Howard chuckles) Yeah, now what about this Boronski deal or whatever his name is? Are you gonna pick us up at 9:00 in the morning or not? Okay, we'll be ready at 9:00 on the nose. (phone clacking) - This is the (speaking in a foreign language), gentlemen. It was taken over several years ago for Herr Boronski's work. It was, of course, the residence of our late King Ferdinand until-- - Until he met with an unfortunate accident. - [Koerner] (laughs) Oh yes, I, I am repeating myself. - Anybody around here ever die a natural death? (Koerner laughing) - (laughing) Poor old Koerner. Your train arrived without an engine and he concludes you're spies. (all laughing) Please be seated. I wanted to see you largely to apologize for him. He's efficient in his work, but a little simpleminded at times. Spies, indeed. (laughs) - What sort of spying did he think we were doing? Spying on what? - I can't imagine. No pictures, please. - Why not? - Oh, I'm not really photogenic for one thing. And, why should an aging scholar like me be of such interest? - What we're really interested in, Dr. Macklin, is getting out of here. That's the trouble with newspapermen. - Boronski's the name if you please. - They're worse than spies. They really never forget anything. - That must be awkward for you at times. - Yes, at times it is. What is the real story, Dr. Macklin? - Story? You wish to know why I'm here in Gudavia and what I'm doing? - Well, it would be nice to get it straight and not have to invent something to fill it out with. - Oh, it isn't really so terribly interesting. It may disappoint you. I was known, principally as a-- - Biologist. - Yes. - Five years ago you disappeared and left no trace. We always figured it might be a political entanglement. - No, it was voluntary. - At that time, I was interested mainly in longevity. But, I reached a point where biology and longevity in particular began to depress me. At any rate, I asked myself why attempt to alter the course of nature. Soon now old gentlemen were flocking to me. Finally I said to them, my dear sirs, if I were to bombard you with gamma rays forever, you would still have to die in your time. No matter what happens to the human brain, muscles, glands, and heart will still atrophy. But, why do we dwell on the past, gentlemen? I'm sure you're much more interested in the present. You bet we are. - I turned from old age to the guidance of the young. Today, I'm merely a humble school master, but proud of my work. Come and see some of it for yourselves. - These, what do you call them, gamma rays-- - (chuckles) Oh, I was speaking figuratively. Gentlemen, please. (lively piano music) - I take it then, that you're no longer interested in improving the species. - Oh, in my humble way I'm very much interested, through education. Is it not right to say that the children of today are-- - [Howard] The citizens of tomorrow? - Yes. (all laughing) - Well, that's the youngster we saw at the hotel yesterday. - I have great hopes of Hedda. She has a natural talent but in a few months under my guidance, I assure you gentlemen, she'll be something quite startling. - [Mike] Yes. - I should appreciate it if our little secret could remain our little secret for the time being. - Your identity? - [Boronski] My work. - Sure, for the time being. - May I introduce you Frau Paula Wendt, my senior tutor. Mr. Meade, Mr. Wilson. - How do you do? - How do you do? - [Howard] How do you do? - Frau Wendt is familiar to your country. She's traveled extensively in the eastern states I believe. - In New York only. - Is that so? Do you know Charlie Robbins my agent? - I'm afraid not. - Well, if you don't mind, gentlemen, I'll leave you for a moment in Frau Wendt's capable hands. Excuse me. - Oh rather. - Come with me. - Yes, sir. - This is our modeling class. The boys are making masks for the annual festival. It starts on Wednesday. - Oh, I might be able to get something good on that. What sort of festival is it? - Traditional. These represent the ancient gods of the mountains, the good and the evil. - Who comes out on top? - And, this is our head pupil, Hugo. - Oh yes. We've met. - Mmm. Now this festival-- - It's a pagan rite but it amuses the populace, teach our young people to join in the life of the community, democratic responsibility. - Now, what is this you're working on here, son? - A legendary figure. The other masks represent legends of the past. Mine is a legend of the present. (dramatic music) - Hugo! - It isn't exactly a beauty, is it? - This is how I see my legend. - Hugo, please. - Mike it's, have you given that nightmare a trial run through Mitiling? - There will be no need for that. - Right out of the comic strip. - I have heard of them. I understand eminent Americans, your businessmen and politicians, read them with unfailing regularity. Oh well, there is a little child in all of us. - And, there must be an answer for you and I wish I could think of it. - [Koerner] Shall I let them have a car now? - No, I want to make quite sure they leave with a favorable impression. It will take a few more days to undo your stupidity. - Why yes, Herr Doctor. There is something else. - Yeah. - There was difficulty again last night with the-- - Difficulty? - Prowling the streets. - They had work to do. - Yes, Herr Doctor, but they were seen later by several people. Isn't there some way of recalling them more quickly? - I'm a scientist, Koerner, not a magician. Our unfortunate are as much concern as mine. You are their custodian, I am merely their creator. Yes, Herr Doctor. (camera clicking) - What was that? - [Howard] Just a souvenir of our visit. I'll give you a print. - [Boronski] Well, gentlemen, if there's nothing else I can show you, we'll continue out little tour. - Well, I should like to take a picture of the lovely Miss Wendt. - No, I'd rather not. - Oh, but-- - I wanna see everything. - Yes, sure. - You'll recover the photograph discretely. - Pretty touchy about being photographed, aren't they? - Rather. Did you see old Boronski's face when I took one of that mask? - [Mike] Sinister looking dump, isn't it? - [Howard] Yes. - I wonder just what he's up to here. He was a good man once. I guess he's just blown his stack. - Oh, you really think he's crackers, do you? - Loony as they come. - Mask then, that's exactly what I saw last night. And, there were 10 or 12 of them. - Sure, fun and games. Some guys were trying to scare you. - I don't think so. They had exactly the same faces and they were alive. They moved. - Okay, for argument's sake they moved. So, what does that prove? - I don't know, I don't know really. I just think there's some connection between those horrible things and Boronski. And, that mask is the link. (somber music) (church bells ringing) Do you think it's our friend Bikstein? - Could be. Certain things happen pretty fast around here. Wish I'd have had a chance to talk to him. - Too bad. - Maybe he left a widow. Let's nose around. (dramatic music) - (cries) He was a good man. He would harm no one. - We're certain of that, Frau Bikstein. And, we're certain he was killed because he tried to contact us. - Frau Bikstein, is this your husband's handwriting? Read it please. - He was one of Dr. Boronski's assistants. He helped with the experiments. - What experiments? (Frau Bikstein cries) Well, just what did he want us to do? - Your husband trusted us, Frau Bikstein. Won't you? - He suspected Dr. Boronski before the experiments began. He only stayed out of curiosity. Then it was too late, he couldn't leave. - By too late what do you-- - Oh, please. You don't understand. You're from a free country. Here it is not safe to ask questions. Or to answer them. Please if you two would go now. One moment. (dramatic music) This my husband took from the laboratory. I think it's one of Dr. Boronski's diary books. I don't know if it will help you, but it might. Please take it. Now, go. - Thank you very much. - Quickly please. (dramatic music) (eerie music) - All right, Mike, you can come in now. - Hey, just listen to this. By exposing the immature brain to the gamma ray or controlled radioactivity, I believe it is possible to determine certain developmental factors both physical and mental. In the second stage, using this as the premise to work on, it is therefore possible to create geniuses or imbeciles at will. The whole future of the human race is already contained within the germ plasm and in a million years of evolution more or less, the full potentiality of the human mind will come to fruition. The gamma ray merely accelerates the natural process of time. - Geniuses and imbeciles. I can't say I understand all that. It doesn't sound like a man in his right mind, does it? - No it doesn't. - I hope Anna's wrong about Paula. How can a lovely girl like that be mixed up in this shocking business? - That's what I wanna find out. (gentle piano music) - It's a long time since I heard that tune. Your mother and I we heard it once in Vienna. You would like it there. - Papa. - Hmm. - I'm frightened. - But, in Vienna there will be nothing to fear. No one to worry you, no one to order you. The children there know how to laugh and sing. Oh, you'll like that. And, you'll play from your heart. My little girl, I'm going to take you there. - When? - Very soon perhaps, but-- - Herr Lochner, Hedda is not to play this weak sentimental music. Dr. Boronski will hear of this. Now, go. - I'm Hedda's father. - [Hugo] I said go! - Tell Boronski what I've said. I'm Hedda's father and now leave us alone. - [Hugo] Hedda was taken from you by the state. - The state, Dr. Boronski. Will he never understand that his work must fail? Will he never understand or realize what he has done to you and to so many others? Will he never see that the minds of people are clouded with hate? Tell him all that! Tell him! Tell him! - You will be sorry for this Herr Lochner. - [Lochner] Get out! - You will be sorry. - Get out! Get out. Go on playing, Hedda. (gentle music) I'll get your things ready. Say nothing, be careful. We cannot wait longer now. - Say, Mike. What the... Do you mind if I come in? - Please do. - Thank you. - Most interesting. Who is black? - My American friend. Do you mind explaining to me-- - You know he can mate you in four moves. I do suggest you watch out for your king's pawn. It is in a dangerous position. - Oh, really? How did you get in here? - Well, you left the door open, I saw the chess board, I could not resist. - Is that so? - I never can resist a game of chess. It is like the game of life only not nearly so dangerous. - Oh. - If you want to move one your pieces without your American friend noticing, I suggest you move your knight. (hand thudding) - That just isn't done. - It is merely taking an opportunity. When you have an advantage, you should make use of it. (Harold mumbles) - It's disgusting. (somber music) (mumbles) trust. (moving to dramatic music) Oh hello. - I have good news for you, wonderful news. - Well, I can't wait. - But, it is about your car. With great difficulty I have found you one. - It's jolly nice of you. - It will be delivered here this evening. - Well, thanks awfully. We don't need it now. We're gonna stay. - Stay? - Yes, we like it here. Fallen in love with the place. Can't stop now, must dash. Oh, cheerio. (gentle orchestral music) - [Mike] Hello there. - Good morning. - Nice place you got here. This where you come to get the formaldehyde out of your lungs? Oh, it's just a figure of speech. I used to be a police reporter in San Francisco. In and out of the lab a lot and in the morgue where they worked on the stiffs. The whole place had a, well, a strange air about it. - Sounds charming. - I have the same feeling about that slotz of yours where you work with Dr. Boronski. Sort of creepy. - You're very imaginative, aren't you? - No, not very. As a matter of fact, I'm kinda slow at times, Mrs. Wendt. Whatever became of Mr. Wendt, by the way? - Oh, Frau is a courtesy title I have at the school. Mr. Wendt was my father. - I have a terrible habit of asking the wrong question. You know in my experience it always seems there's a real nice guy or a very nice girl like yourself caught up in every racket. - What do you mean by that? - Oh, playing dumb, innocent, covering up, afraid to talk. I don't know why you stay on and play ball with old Boronski, but I don't think it's your own idea. - You're quite wrong, Mr. Wilson. I'm here out of my own free will. I came here, since you ask about him, with my father who worked for Boronski. When he died five years ago, Boronski offered me his job. My father worked with him before. They were close friends. - Your father may have been a close friend of Dr. Macklin, but I don't think he'd go for this phony Boronski character or this fooling around with the gamma ray. And, I don't think you would either if you had a choice or perhaps a real friend. (emotional orchestral music) (wind whistling) (river rustling) - Go on, Hugo, this sounds most interesting. - Well, sir, Herr Lochner was most insulting and I was suspicious so I stopped just outside the door. I could not hear all their words, but considering Herr Lochner's peculiar behavior, I'm sure he intends leaving with Hedda tonight. - All right, I'll take care of that, Hugo, thank you. There's Paula. Go after her, see that she doesn't get to the village. Tell her I want to see her. (lively chase music) (speaking in a foreign language) - Oh, thanks awfully. (swing squeaking) If you can do that, there's hope for you yet. - Thank you, there's a little child in all of us. - A little what? Where's that photograph you stole? - Come and get it. (Howard grunting) - All right, keep it. Anyway, I got the negative. With this I can produce hundreds of photographs. There's a little child in all of us, yes. (feet thudding) - [Hugo] Give it to me, I want it! - Oh, oh, no you don't. You, you little Hugo, you. I tell you what I will do. - What? - I'll give it to you for Christmas (chuckles). Hello chaps. - Get him! (boys shouting) (lively music) - Help! Mike, Mike. - Merry Christmas. (somber music) - That'll be all for tonight, Paula. You'd better get some sleep. Good night. - Good night. (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (ominous music) (moving to dramatic music) - [Paula] Herr Lochner, Herr Lochner. - Oh Paula. How I wanted to see you once more to say goodbye and to thank you-- - Herr Lochner. I couldn't come earlier. Boronski was watching me, keeping me working. You mustn't leave tonight. He knows, I'm sure he knows. - We are started and we must at least try. Too late to turn back now. - But, they'll kill you. - Then they'll kill me. Sooner or later they would have done that anyway. - Yes, but what about-- - Hedda? I'll go on, Paula. - I shall, I shall never forgive myself. - But, you are not to blame. You were trapped. That is all. We'll meet again, my dear. Must go now. Soon it will be light. (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (tense music) (moving to dramatic music) - Help! - [Lochner] Hedda (mumbles)! - [Hedda] Help! (Hedda screams) - [Lochner] Hedda, Hedda, Hedda! (screams) (dramatic music) - Hedda. Herr Lochner! Herr Lochner! Herr Lochner! - Paula! Paula! Paula! - Herr Lochner! Herr Lochner! (Paula cries) Hedda! Hedda! Oh, Hedda! - Who is that? - Hedda! - Paula, who is that? - Herr Lochner. I tried to stop him but I couldn't. I knew this would happen. - He had his little girl with him? - Hedda! - [Mike] Paula! - Let me go, I've got to find Hedda. - Listen to me. You won't find her this way. Just let me help you. - But, you can't. - But, if you'd just tell me the truth. - The truth? You want a good story, don't you? Your readers of the newspaper want a daily dose of excitement. Well go and write your story. And, what you haven't seen already, you can make up. - Okay. - That's the usual way, isn't it? - All right, so I've got something to write about. If I stay around here any longer, maybe there'll be more murders, more horrors, and more bodies for you to cry over. - Please stop! - Look, will you give me the real story? I want it from you, Paula, now. - I can tell you nothing. - You mean you're afraid to tell me. - Please! - [Mike] Or is it because you're helping Boronski to experiment with human beings? - No, no please believe me. It isn't for myself. - Well, what is it then? Who are you trying to protect? - Please, you cannot do anything. - I can show what's happening to these children. - How? By making them the center of screaming curiosity? The little freaks, the little geniuses. - Yes, but Boronski can't always make geniuses, can he? Sometimes something goes wrong and you get a brat like Hugo or a mob of mindless goons to do Boronski's dirty work for him. I'll write the story. I'll bring this horror out into the open. Tell Boronski. Go back and tell him. - Tell him what, Mr. Wilson? - Where's the little girl? - (chuckles) Splendid view, Mr. Wilson, don't you think so? But, you don't appear to be enjoying it, huh? - Cut the act, Doc, it's no good. Take a look at the view from over here. (dramatic music) - [Boronski] I'm afraid I don't understand. - You don't eh? Well, I think I do. I'm gonna find little Hedda if it's the last thing I do here. Keep your gang of goons away from me. They might get hurt. (somber music) (whistle whistling) (dramatic music) (punch thudding) (whistle whistling) - Koerner, I think it will be necessary to watch the people more closely. There'll be no street gathering. - But, Herr Boronski, the festival. - You will cancel it immediately. There's not to be a single mask on the streets tonight. (dramatic music) (crowd chattering) - Ah, ah good morning, Herr Wilson. As I was just telling your friend, I have good news for you. - Right now I've got news for you. - Ah yes? - Yes, I just saw what happened to Lochner last night. - Lochner? I don't understand. - I think you do, but we won't argue. Right now I'm more interested in this little girl Hedda. What have you done with her? - I'm afraid I-- - You wouldn't know anything about that would you, Koerner. You just wouldn't know. I got you figured out, you big fat stuffed shirt. - Shh! Your job is to bully these people, keep 'em in line while Boronski does the murdering. I saw Lochner's body. (crowd chattering) It was lying crushed in the stones in the gully. It's my guess you can thank this wonderful democratic republic represented by Commandant Koerner! (crowd chattering) (ominous music) (dramatic music) (lively music) (crowd chattering) Howard! Howard! Howard, are you here? (crowd chattering) - [Man] Hey! - [Mike] Take it easy. - Herr Wilson. Herr Wilson. Herr Wilson. Do you remember me, Frau Bikstein? - I'm looking for my English friend. Have you seen him anywhere. - No, but come quickly please. - Well, what is it? - Come, I will tell you. - What's all the excitement about? Don't tell me the people of... You found a little courage. - Perhaps. - [Mike] Good. - There isn't much time. I've seen Hedda. Boronski has her at the castle. - [Mike] Well, let's get her outta there. What are we waiting for? (loud knocking) - It's the police. The curtains, quick, hide behind there. - Frau Bikstein, we have orders to search the cottage. - [Frau Bikstein] There's no one here. (punches thudding) (furniture clattering) - What about you? - Look, I shall be all right. (lively music) - [Officer] Halt. (crowd chattering) Stop, help! (car rumbling) - [Howard] Taxi! I say this is bit of a do isn't it? Hop in. - Well, we won't get far in the jalopy. - Shh, don't hurt her feelings. She goes like a bomb. - Get going, will ya? (car rumbling) Where'd you get this thing anyway? - Old Koerner sent it round this afternoon. Had it in his bottom drawer. Hey, where have you been? - Never mind that. Look where you're going. - Oh quite. Where to? - The castle. - Oh. (car rumbling) (tire hissing) A puncture. I say, what frightfully bad luck. - Come on, let's get to the castle. (car exploding) (all grunting) (fire crackling) (Paula coughing) Koerner's compliments no doubt. Are you all right? - I'm in one piece. - You better run into town and get some help. Looks like we're gonna need it. - Okay. (dramatic music) (eerie music) - Boronski's usually in his study at this time. - How do we get outta here? - [Paula] We have to come back. There's only one way. (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) - Wow. You didn't show us this on the 50 cent tour. - It's sealed off from the other part of the building. Wait here till I fetch Hedda. - No wait, I'll go with you. - Please, I, I know what I'm doing. (door hissing) (door clattering) (door hissing) (door clanking) (door squeaking) (Hedda gasps) Shh. Very quiet, darling. Do exactly as I tell you. - [Hedda] Are you going to take me away? - Stand still. (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (machine thudding) (machine humming) - [Boronski] Set the Mark-5 switch. - [Man] For what Herr Doctor? - [Boronski] Experiment X. (switch clacking) (machine thudding) (door hissing) (door clanking) (door hissing) (door clanking) (ominous music) (alarm blaring) (tense music) (door clattering) - Hugo. - You cannot escape. I only have to press this. - [Paula] Hugo, please don't touch it. - Give me one good reason why I should not. - Hugo, Boronski, Boronski killed our father. And now he'll kill me. - That is not a good enough reason. - Wait. Hugo, think, for once try to think of who I am. - Who are you? - Your sister. - Sentiment has no place in our philosophy. Boronski has said so. (alarm ringing) (doors clattering) - Come on! (door hissing) (door clanking) - The (mumbles). Through the schoolroom. To this way. (door hissing) (door clanking) (lever clanking) - He cut the circuit. (door hissing) (door clanking) - Mr. Wilson. (machine thudding) If you want to save Hedda's life, you have only to come into the control room and raise your hand. One of my attendants will come and fetch her. Unfortunately, I can't promise the same amnesty for you and Frau Wendt. I give you one minute to make up your mind. (door hissing) (door clanking) (stool clattering) You're wasting your energy, Mr. Wilson. You've half a minute. (dramatic music) Time's up, Mr. Wilson. (machine thudding) You asked me about the gamma ray, Mr. Wilson. You would've been well-advised not to have been so inquisitive. It's a pity you'll never be able to relate in your newspaper the experience you are going to have. It's quite unique. It's also rather painful. The ray has many uses, Mr. Wilson. It can be used to create genius like Hugo, future leaders of the world. It can be used to create morons, goons you call them. They can be very useful also, very useful indeed. The brain slowly shrivels up. It is really most interesting. The heat is terrific. Are you feeling warm, Mr. Wilson? You've felt nothing yet. No, you can't escape it. Before your mind dies, you will experience all the extremes of heat. It will not be pleasant, Mr. Wilson. (dramatic music) - Look out! (punches thudding) (men grunting) Come on some of you. (men grunting) (punches thudding) - Are you feeling giddy, Mr. Wilson? It's getting quite hot now, 160 Fahrenheit. (machine thudding) (eerie music) It is a pity it will not be possible for Hedda to complete her course of treatment in the normal way. She would've been the greatest pianist the world has known. Now, she will be nothing. A thing without a mind. 180 degrees. Soon, you will no longer be able to think for yourself. The same thing will happen to Paula and to Hedda. 10 more degrees, Mr. Wilson and then... (ominous music) Nine, eight, seven, six, five. You all right, Hugo? Hugo. Go upstairs. (ominous music) Four, three. - There he is. - [Boronski] Two. - Herr Doctor, come quickly. (ominous music) - [Boronski] What is it? (Boronski shouting) (machines exploding) (dramatic music) (doors hissing) - [Mike] Look after the kid. (fire crackling) (punch thudding) (machines exploding) (fire crackling) (punch thudding) (man screaming) (punch thudding) (emotional music) (castle exploding) (fire crackling) (lively music) (crowd cheering) (balloon popping) (bells ringing) - Ah good morning, sir. I hope you slept well. - Well, what do you know? - Must be the fire. Shock I suppose. I remember I had an aunt once who fell over the banisters, right on top of her head. It completely changed her. - Well, something bounced him back to normal. It's whatever it was was needed. - [Paula] And, now all we need is a car. - [Mike] Yes, a car. (Koerner laughing) - Good morning, gentlemen. Well, well, well, all ready to leave, eh? I trust that you two have enjoyed your little trip. And, now that our disagreement with Herr Boronski has been settled, I have no doubt that Mitiling will return to normal. Time marches on, the ever-changing pageantry of life. (laughs) - Well, we shouldn't look a gift horse in the mouth. Or should we? Come on, Hedda, you can sit next to me. That is if Uncle Mike doesn't mind. - What do you mean uncle, I-- - (laughs) Uncle Mike doesn't mind. - (laughs) On behalf of Gudavia, I thank you. The people of Mitiling are proud of you. We are all proud sons. Goodbye. (lively music) (bells ringing) (crowd cheering) (dramatic music)
