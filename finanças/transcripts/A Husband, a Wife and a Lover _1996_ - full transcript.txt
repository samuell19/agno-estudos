** [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle] * [music] [busy kitchen noise] [Lisa] That looks right. Put a little of that in there and save the rest for tomorrow in pasta bowls. Put a little oil in it, make it easier to move. Bill, [indistinguishable] That's beautiful. Cover it. Put it over there. A little bit more salt and pepper on those. It looks great, just great. Now get it into the freezer right away, go. Go. Coming behind you... Careful. [Lisa] Hi. Are you a waiter or a bartender? You want the owner, Vivian. -[Marty] No I want you. -[Vivian] Hello, can I help you? [Lisa] It's personal. What are you talking about? [Marty] Your husband's in big trouble. The people he owes want their money by five o'clock. Otherwise, there's gonna be a knock at your door. [Lisa] I'll be back before we start serving. [Vivian] What? [Lisa] Where is he? He's at lunch with an investor. Come on, Samantha. This is serious, get him on the phone. I would but, he disconnected his cell phone. If you find him could you tell him that hood was here again this morning! [T.V. and bar noise] [Eric] Come on, Gypsy Girl. Come on, Gypsy Girl. There you go, come on, come on. Come on, baby. That's me, that's my girl! Come on, baby! Whoa! That's me! I told you twenty to one, ready to run. Honey? [Lisa] This time you've gone too far. Don't you ever, ever do that again. [Eric] Wait, help me here. What exactly did I do? [Lisa] It's not bad enough to embarrass me at work now you've got people threatening us. They're coming to the house, Eric. [Eric] No they're not. That was a big misunderstanding. It's all been cleared up. Look I'll send Viv a dozen roses. And it was a lousy thing to do to you too. I'm sorry. [Lisa] You're always sorry. How much do you owe this time? [Eric] Not a dime. Lisa, I said I was sorry. Wives get angry at husbands, husbands get angry at wives. It's the ying and yang of married life. Right, Jack? This is for you. Come have a quick drink with me, come on. [Lisa] I'm working a party, Eric. I'll meet you at the gallery after work. [Eric] Lisa? I like you like this. Cheeks flushed those wild untamable strands of hair. I could always make you smile. Let's skip the gallery. [Lisa] You're crazy. [Eric] I'm one lucky guy. [Eric] I wouldn't do a documentary. I see something more like, the civil war. [Mrs. Feld] What's the difference? [Eric] Well I see a ah, a latitudinal history of um, racing in America. I-I would um, I would intercut profiles of the owner of a stud farm. A trainer, a jockey, a female jockey, the stable boy, the racing fan and then build up to the climax, The Derby. [Lisa] Have you seen any of Eric's films? They're thoughtful without being solemn. [Eric] Well, she is my biggest fan. And of course my toughest critic. Ha ha. How about if I send you some cassettes? [Mrs. Feld] How much would a project like that cost? [Eric] Well, you know we're talkin' about a labor of love here. [Mrs. Feld] So what do you think, dear? [Lisa] Eric's had three wonderful documentaries on PBS and some of his industrials are little gems. But I think this might be the film that wins him his Emmy. [Eric] Major backer would meet some very interesting show business people, we'd go to premiers, you might even have to come out to L.A. [Mrs. Feld] Oh. This would be tax deductible. [Eric] We'd work something out. We'd have a lot of laughs. Hey, hey do you know why cannibals don't eat clowns? [Mrs. Feld] No, why? [Eric] Because they taste funny. [laughter] You wanna hear a great title, "Oh, For a Horse With Wings." [Mrs. Feld] Oh... [Eric] Thanks for helping me with Mrs. Feld tonight. [Lisa] You don't have to thank me for telling the truth. [Eric] Could have mentioned I haven't had a film in seven years... [Lisa] I wanted to believe everyone of those years you could do it again. I could have told her that, too. [Eric] Hey, there's no one like you, honey. [Vivian] Here you go. Try that. [Lisa] Don't be mad at me, ok? [Vivian] Hmm? I'm going into business for myself. I just signed the incorporation papers. [Vivian] Why? [Lisa] We're in way over our heads financially. We just drove Sarah up to college last week. Barely been making Bruce's tuition payments the last two years. With the two of them away... [Vivian] Look it takes capital to start a catering business. [Lisa] Dad left me a savings bond. I've got a little over nine thousand saved up. Th-that's enough isn't it? [Vivian] Oh wow, is this moving fast! You think you're a little spooked by the empty nest? There's another reason I need my own business. Yeah? I'm... thinking of leaving Eric. Oh my God. [Lisa] It's a lot worse than I've told you. Business is a disaster, his gambling is out of control, he takes every penny you pay me if I don't sneak it right into my personal account. It's... I've just been waiting for Sarah. Oh he's such a great guy. You guys always seem to have such a good time together. Honey I'm sorry. So it's okay? We'll still be friends? Of course we will. We'll work something out. I'll talk to Gary, see if he can't throw something Eric's way. [Lisa] He won't take it. I know him. [Vivian] Oh but he must see how desperate things are. [Lisa] He has no idea. He's living in a dream world. [Eric laughing] Ha ha. I did. [Gary] All right here we are, six stores. Specialty clothing along here... [Eric] Can I have a charge account? [Gary] Espresso bar over there. And my video store. I'm keeping the franchise. [Eric] Well no wonder, this is a great location. But I'm having a problem, I uh, need someone to manage it for me. [Lisa] You know movies. Paid forty grand the first year. [Eric] Well what you don't understand when you're a graduate of Betty Crocker U, is that there's just some things you can't put in the alumni newsletter. Eric, you don't have to tell Princeton magazine you're managing a video store. [Worker] Mr. Reynolds, can I see you for a sec? Yeah sure. Just be a minute. Honey, that was very sweet what you tried to do over there. But what does a girl from Betty Crocker U know? It was a joke. I'm sorry I didn't go to college. I'm sorry I embarrass you. You don't embarrass me. I was teasing you. We kid around, that's what makes our marriage so great. Oh yeah, our marriage is paradise. The house is leased, the furniture's leased, we're in debt up to here. I hate living like this. If you wanted a regular paycheck you should've married a janitor. You think we're talking about money here. -I'm a filmmaker. -You're a fabulous filmmaker. You just don't make any films. You love to put me down for having a dream, don't you?-- I married you because you had a dream. I didn't marry a guy who plays the horses. Or who plays around. [Eric] Gary, thanks for the offer but, I don't think I was cut out for retail. [Vivian] What'd he say? [Eric] But I will take some of your money in my poker game. [Vivian] Oh dear. [Lisa] Excuse me? You-you let somebody raid my account. Your teller says I've got only forty two dollars. I know I've got more than nine thousand. [Mrs. Horvath] Please, sit. Let's see what's going on here. You had that much but you've been making ATM withdrawals. Those not mine. Who withdraws three hundred dollars a day for a month? Do you have some ID? This is a personal account. You let somebody steal from me. The system says there are two cards. What about your husband, doesn't he have one? No I told you. It's not a joint account. Tell her. About a month ago a couple came in. He had a statement for the account and she had some I.D., I think a credit card in your name. Only uh, she wasn't you. Um, they said that they had lost the ATM card for the account. And well we issued a new card. Was it him? Uh-huh. [Lisa] This woman, what did she look like? She had beautiful hair. Beautiful red hair. * [sad music] Thank you. -* [sad music] -[seagulls] [-Eric] You wanna watch TV? I heard that uh... -[zipping of bags] what is this? I went to the bank today. They were surprised my hair wasn't red. Samantha and me? That's nothing. Nothing new I think you mean. Honey look, we've had some rocky moments lately, what couple hasn't? Forging my signature and stealing my savings is a rocky moment? The kids come first, they needed money in their checking accounts. It's funny I had to give each of them a hundred the day they left. I'll get around to opening the accounts! Aye I had a call today. HBO is this close to picking up the racing documentary. That money was mine. My name was on the account. It was from my dad... -my work. I want it back now. -I'll pay you back. When I have it. You used it to pay your bookie didn't you? They were comin' after us. You've got money. Give it me. The poker game is rigged. -Give me what you've got! -Hey, hey, hey, hey would you please calm down. Mrs. Feld is gonna come through and HBO I can feel it. Come on we're on a roll here. Come on... Let go of me. That woman is not gonna give you a dime, HBO doesn't know you exist... Honey, don't you understand the power of a dream? I have to make this film. [Lisa] Get your story straight, Eric. You put a couple of grand on the ponies so the kids would have book money, or so you could win the Jury prize at Cannes. Which was it? Well it was a spur-of-the-moment thing. It just seemed like a good idea at the time. We were gonna borrow it, hit the double, put it back, you were never gonna know! Would you take this, it was a lousy game, I want you to have it as a down payment. Give me another shot! Samantha's history. I'm gonna quit gambling. And I'm gonna take Mrs. Feld's money and give you ten thousand dollars right off the top. Lisa, listen we have been in some tight spots before, you know that. -I,I don't even understand what's-- -Three hundred bucks? You do something like this and you think you can buy me off with three hundred dollars? Hey can we sleep on this tonight please? Things are gonna look a lot different in the morning. That used to work, Eric. And then for years I faked it and I felt guilty and trapped. And all the time you had this other life. And I felt trapped. Lisa give me one more chance. For the kids. I'm leaving you, Eric. You've said that before. This time I mean it. * [dramatic music] [dialing on phone] [Sarah message over phone] Hi this is Sarah. Guess what? I'm out. Leave me a message. Thanks, bye. [Lisa into phone] It's mom, it's after two where are you? I'm on the road on the way to Canada and I just realized that I don't have the new number at Bruce's dorm. I, I have something to tell you guys. So could you call me at three one five five five four one two five before your first classes in the morning? I'll wait for your call. Bye, I love you. Bye. * [somber music] [shower running] [crying] [phone rings] Hello? [Sarah from phone] Mom, thank God. Bruce and I are going to the hospital, it's dad. -[Lisa] What? -[Sarah] He collapsed in the drive-way. Bruce said the doctor told him it's some kind of stroke. We'll meet you there. The Kingsleys were coming home from a party, they think it was about twelve thirty. [Lisa] Thanks. [Bruce] The car door was open and he was just lying there. If the domelight hadn't been on, they wouldn't have seen him. What I don't get is where were you? What were you doing in Canada? Mom? He must have needed cigarettes. There were all these quarters on the ground. They figured he'd been robbed. Mrs. McKeever. I just showed the cat scan to the chief of neurology and there's no doubt, it was a stroke and it involves the brain stem. Oh my God. Now he could live a few weeks or he could go on for a lot longer. Now given the type of stroke he's had, he's probably gonna have some trouble swallowing. But uh, there's no other paralysis. And fortunately his speech hasn't been impaired. Is he awake? Can we see him? Yeah. But he's still groggy. Doctor... really, how bad is it? It's hard to predict. We'll know more in the next forty eight hours. Mom, you had to see us in person for some big announcement? Could we do this some other time? You're finally leaving him weren't you? [Sarah] He's got me at left wing right now, but I think he's moving me to sweeper for the Colgate game. I was counting on you coming. [Eric] I'll be there, honey. I have never missed one of your games, I'm gonna start now. Dad, Dad we love you, ok? We're gonna stay right here beside you 'til you get out of the woods. [Eric] Never in the woods. I never liked 'em. How can you bet with a tree. This whole thing was just a way of gettin' us together for a few hours. Monday morning I want the two of you back in class. Ok, but only if you promise to be well enough to go home by then. So mom can take care of you. * [dramatic music] [Doctor] He's come a long way in one week. We're gonna have to discharge him soon. When will he get off the feeding tube? Probably never. But we can put a shunt inside so we can feed him directly into his stomach. He can move around, maybe even sip a little liquid or nibble on something soft. Basically he's gonna need help for the rest of his life. Oh boy. Yeah. So... we're talking permanent round-theclock nursing care? Yes. I think you'd be better off taking care of him at home. As long as he's got you, I think it's a perfectly good way to go. [Lisa] Easy, I got you. [Eric] Uh, I'm gonna sleep better tonight... having you next to me. I moved into Sarah's room. Boy, you really miss her, huh? Yeah, that's it. No reason to start confronting reality at this late date. I can still make you smile... Liking you was never the problem. God, Lisa. Did you add some steps before I came back? Ohh, oh... Don't misjudge the way things are. You're Bruce and Sarah's father... they'd be here if they could. Since they can't, I'm not gonna walk out on you. What happens when I get better? I'm here now, I think that's what matters. I'll uh, I'll make you love me again. Could we take this one day at a time? The reality is, you're never going to see me because I'm going to be out all the time. [Eric] Doing what? Trying to pay for nurses, food, rent, textbooks... I'm not gonna let you do it alone. I'll figure out something. [coughing] Ok. Just try not to talk. If that's possible. Just one thing, when the kids ask, tell them this is the way you want it to be. Needs a valve job. [Lisa] What kind of money are we talking about? Well the dealer will charge you eight hundred, I'll do it for six, I'll have it for you tomorrow night. Six hundred's a problem for me right now. [Art] Put it on a card. The cards got taken away, my husband's had a stroke. Wow uh, gee I'm sorry. He comes in here all the time, give him my best. I will. Listen, since you know us I... I mean, this is hard. I don't have a job right now, but I've never not paid a bill in my life. I need a car to look for work. Can you fix it and let me pay you, I don't know, a hundred a month? No I couldn't live with that. Can I use your phone to call another tow truck? You know, I got this sales rep who has this gimmick. Every time he comes in he gives you something, you know. Makes it impossible for him to leave without an order. Sometimes it's wine, hockey tickets. This week he left me these. Looks like they'll fit perfectly. You said I had to pay up front. I said I wasn't willing to take money if someone didn't have any. -[Lisa] So you're saying-- -[Art] You can use that old car out there, pick this one up tomorrow night. I close at six. [Lisa] We'll pay you back. Sure. Soon as you're husband gets back on your feet. I can't depend on that happening. Keys are under the visor. Thank you. I meant what I said, I will pay you back, eventually. I can tell. [alarm clock] [Lisa] Was it bad tonight? Been asleep at all? [Eric] No. I'm sorry you get up every night and do this. [pouring sound] [Lisa] You want codeine? [Eric] God, yes. Could you, could you just-- -[Lisa] Sure, sure... oh! -[bottle falling] [kitchen timer ringing] -[phone ringing] -[air drill sounds] Maskin and son. Uh Mr. Maskin, it's Lisa McKeever. I'm running late and I don't want to hold you up, so can I pick up my car tomorrow? Um, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's done. Tomorrow'll be fine. Great. I-I've been handing out uh, samples of my brownies all day, your ideas working, that's why I'm late. My idea? About not going any place without a free sample Since nine this morning I've booked a luncheon and a baby shower and in another half, I might even have a whole bar mitzvah. You rent rooms or what? I'm a caterer. If I'm lucky and get a deposit, I may even be able to pay you. You sure my keeping the loner another day is ok? Oh no, that's ok. I'll switch'em on the way to work in the morning. Ok, I-I gotta go. Uh hey um, hang in there. Ok. [phone beeps] * [dramatic music] [crashing] Hey! Hey, hey, shoo, go! [knocking] Hello? * [dramatic music] She's not smoking again. Sorry. No, no. These are for you. I didn't get the bar mitzvah, I won't be paying you for awhile. You should see the garbage people buy out of these machines. They'll be gone by two.. [Lisa] I didn't make these for sale. I know but I-I can't eat all of those. I'll have some after lunch... why shouldn't you make some money? Actually, that's a good idea. Caterers spend most of their time waiting around for jobs. If I lined up a bunch of places that could sell fresh baked goods... You know I usually eat at the diner across the street there. Would you like to get a sandwich or something? I would, but I-I have a twelve thirty meeting. Right. Yeah well, thanks for the cookies. [sighs] -Ow! -Sorry. You know I've taken care of some very big people in my time. Like basketball players? Ha, I mean well known people. -What the hell is that? -[sound of leafblower outside] Just the gardener. We don't have a gardener [Mrs. Skinner] Maybe the Mrs. hired one. Somebody's gotta clean up the yard. * [dramatic music] [Lisa] I need commercial ovens. What if I rented your kitchens every night you're not using them, say from six to two a.m.? You have that much baking? Eighteen outlets, seventy two dozen a day. Wow! I could do more. But I gotta get home by two to change Eric's nutrient bag. How's he doing? Well. You know you and Gary could stop by any time you've got a few-- [crashing noise] What the hell is that? * [dramatic music] Ha. Just have to figure a way to dampen the noise a little bit. Why are you doing all this for me? Figure you could use a little help around here. With the trees and the raccoons. I would have got to the trees. I think taking care of a sick husband and working at night to start your own business that's a lot of work for one person. I know, but there's no... you just can't keep doing things for me. I like working with my hands, kinda relaxes me. Thanks. Who's that? The new handyman. [commentator on T.V.] I see you got the filling station guy trimming the trees. It was his idea. We got to talking when he fixed the Explorer. We paying him or what, what's the deal? No, he's one of my brownie customers. -Damn! -[remote falls] Hey, I dropped the remote. You drownin' there or what? Lisa you know how hard it is for me to get outta bed. Thanks, honey. I am so bored. [Lisa] Why don't you call some of those poker buddies. Or those guys from the track who've forgetten you exist? I never knew his name, that mechanic. [Lisa] Art Maskin. -[Lisa] Hi. -[Eric] Hi. I brought you three dozen brownies. Oh. Half walnut, half pecan. Good um... [laughs] you know, you know um, the other day when I asked you out to lunch, was that meeting just that meeting that day or you always kinda busy for lunch? One of the things about caterers it's hard work and you need lunch to keep going. Oh well you know uh, I'm gonna finish here one thirty, two. How about we grab a sandwich then? Earlier would be better. I should be home to relieve the nurse. Fine we'll make it a quick sandwich. Won't even spoil your dinner. I'd like that. As long as... Yeah? It's just lunch with one of my customers. Lunch means lunch. See you then. That new warehouse club's incredible. I got a pound of flower and two hundred pounds of baking chocolate. Twenty percent below wholesale. -[crashing noise] -[Mrs. Skinner] Oh! That woman missed her calling. She's born for vaudeville. I've gotta go out again. If Viv calls about the flower, tell her I'll get it out of her garage tomorrow. I thought you were off the rest of the day? No, I'm having a sandwich with a client. Well push it to tomorrow. We'll send the clumsiest woman in the world home and go see a movie. Sounds like fun. Wish we'd talked about it earlier. [Mrs. Skinner] Paper or plastic? Mark my words, plastic, paper does it to ya every time. Must be a big client. Some guy in the market for a couple of tons of brownies? We can do a movie on Saturday. What shall we have for dinner? -Oh... -[taps bottle] you know, New York strip medium rare, cottage fries, and a caesar with anchovies. -Right. -[Mrs. Skinner] What are you thinking of? He's got his drip. [Lisa] Oh. Old habits are tough to break. Nice to see ya so happy. I'm late. Tell him the trees need some more work, will ya? I uh, hope you like chocolate. [laughing] Ok, admit it. You were giving a formal luncheon and your twelve guests came down with pneumonia. I finished up the ambulance sooner than I thought so I closed up early. Some sandwich. You did all this yourself? I told you, I'm good with my hands. Um, you sure you don't want another lobster? No thanks, I'm stuffed. Couldn't your dad have spelled you at the station? Well I uh, never knew my dad. I'm sorry, I assumed from the way you answered the phone. No um, when I bought the station I had to come up with a name, so Maskin & Son. Sounds stable, likes you been around forever. Or, maybe I was just wishing out loud. How'd you learn to cook like this? I like to eat. When you live alone there's TV and cooking. Thanks. Mmm. * [romantic music] [Lisa] I thought you were taking me home? [Art] I am. In kind of a roundabout way. * [majestic music] Is it legal? Well as long as we stay under the commercial lanes FAA's happy. And you just do this? Look. Horseshoe Falls. When I was a kid I used to sit on a fence next to this old country airfield watching this pilot fuel up his crop duster. Kept asking him questions about how planes flew... I never figured he'd take me up for a ride. And when you grew up? I knew it was the one thing I had to do. [Art] Look, look, look down there. [Lisa] It's so great up here. You forget. You forget everything. That was the idea. [video poker sounds] Hi. How are you? Need anything? I'm fine. Nice lunch? [Lisa] It was ok. [Lisa] Business is picking up. We're putting on five party shifts Thanksgiving evening. I'm not quite sure what we're gonna do. We're having dinner with the kids. I meant about having time to cook. You know what drives me crazy about you? The way you think you keep pulling the wool over my eyes. I have no secrets from you, Eric. Oh no. You just come in whistling after a five hour lunch with the tree trimmer because there's a bright golden haze in the meadow. Art and I have an occasional lunch. We're friends. I'm not allowed to have friends? I got two more Thanksgiving dinners. Oh, big? -One's forty people. -Wow. [Lisa] I'm interviewing party chefs this afternoon. But I still gotta find a place to do the pre-cooking. [Art] Do it at my house. [Lisa] Really? [Art] Sure. [Lisa] That would be great. I can't get anything done at home. [Art] How's he doing? [Lisa] Better. Better but, not great? You have to understand the way Eric and I have been living. He's a man who never not once since we've been married ever cleared the table after a meal. When Sarah was born, we decided we should both have life insurance policies in case we were run over by a truck or something. He borrowed on the equity until the company finally cancelled the policies. Naturally he didn't tell me, when I found out I asked him why, he looked at me like I was crazy. "Native Dancer was even money" he said. He also loves his kids more than any man alive. [Art] You never thought of leaving? [Lisa] I thought about it. [Art] Just never did. [Lisa] There were all kinds of good excuses. Never be able to support myself... [Art] At least we're past that. You're already make more money than me. [Lisa] Wasn't really money. He was Bruce and Sarah's daddy. They were crazy about him. I was crazy about them. You just don't seem like the kind of person to put up with all that stuff. Affairs, gambling debts, stolen money... People change. I'm not the same woman I was when I married him. You know, when my wife left I realized what total strangers we'd become. The people who'd met and fallen in love... the ones with the private nicknames and the ones who stopped to pet stray cats, those people had just vanished! Why did she leave? She never really said. And nobody else ever came along? Not 'til now. I thought I was able to leave him. I can't now. I don't want you to. I just want you to know how things are. It would be really nice right now if you go wash your hands or something. * [dramatic music] [leaf blower noise] Viv picked her up, I don't know where they were goin' Viv? Can I uh, do something for you? Yeah, save my ears. Oh, sorry. You know uh, we really don't know each other. I'm Art Maskin from the garage. Uh, would-would you like me to uh, drive you somewhere? [engine starts] [brakes squeal] [leaf blower starts up] [Eric] Hey! I thought I told you... Hey! Hey! Oh did you know that Eric can drive? He can barely get in and out of his wheelchair. Yesterday while you and Viv were at Pittsburgh Plaza he drove himself out to the mailbox and back. He's always done that. He's milking his invalid routine. He's not nearly as helpless as he pretends to be. He admits he's lazy. Does he admit how angry he is? That's the question. Nobody likes what a stroke does to you. Angry about us. About us? There's nothing to be angry about. We're friends. We are, that's all we are. Well you have to grant the fact that it's after midnight and you're here could possibly suggest something else to him. I've been totally up front with him about it being over. Where's the pineapple? -Pineapple? Here. -I'm just taking care of him. He knows that. Maybe he does, but he doesn't like seeing me around. He's jealous. Ha ha. He lost the right to be jealous after about the first three women... after he lost all my money at the track. It's not about money for him. Whose side are you on? I think that would be obvious by now. I can't... yet... * [soft romantic music] [Eric] What time are the kids coming home on Wednesday? [Lisa] I don't know, they're getting rides. [Eric] When they were little remember we used to always go skating on Thanksgiving eve. That was the best night of the year. We had that rink all to ourselves. [Lisa] Could you put that down for a minute? I have all these dinners I'm doing. I'm gonna be cooking non-stop for the next three days. Well I could peel potatoes or something. You never peeled a potato in your life. Yeah well I could learn. To help. I've invited Art to have dinner with us Thursday here. I'm making all the dishes at work, he'll just cook the turkey and warm everything else up. That grease-monkey is not coming through this door into my house. I don't wanna hurt you. I will say this only once. I feel like a robot. I cater. I change your bed. I shop. I get up in the night to change the drip. Every minute of every day I think about the fact that I'm the one who has to earn the money for tuition, medicine, doctor bills, and I pretend to the kids everything's all right. I'm not a robot, Eric. I've said it's over between us. What you've done to me... it's just over. What are you really saying, Lisa? I'm saying, if you want Thanksgiving dinner served in this house, Art is going to do it. Forget Thanksgiving. You're telling me to my face. You're involved with the yard man. I'm saying I need help. The kids can help. The kids are great. Sarah can bake and, and, and Bruce and I can figure out the turkey. I want Art with me on Thanksgiving. Well what if that isn't possible? One way or another, it's possible. [engine stops] -[Art] Hello? -[door handle shaking] Eric, Eric, the doors locked Hello?! [Art yelling and falling] [Eric] You ok? Uhh. Yeah I'm ok. Just kinda had the wind knocked outta me. [Eric] She's not home. And I can't do much to help you. Anything feel broken, should I call 911? [Art] No, no I'm ok. Just, just gotta catch my breath. No don't do-- Whoa, hey, hey! Ha ha. Hey you on top of me. Sit back. [Eric] Look, why don't you just load me up before one of us gets killed, ok? [Art] Ok. [commercials playing on T.V.] Good God, look at that. I haven't had a beer in two months. You want a beer? Have one. Can't. Doctor says it's one of the many ways I did this to myself. [beer bottle opening] [beer bottle spraying] [laughter] [gasps] One more's not gonna hurt anything now. No, no it's just for the taste. One more's just wanna make you keep on going. So tell me, Art, what's in this for you? Besides the chance to torment a cripple. Nobody likes to be alone on a holiday. Well, to each his own. Being a fifth wheel doesn't sound too swift to me. I'll do whatever it takes. Whatever 'what' takes? That's my question. To be a part of her life. You're unbelievable, you know that. You come into my house and you just, say something like that. She needs help. She's about to snap. Don't tell me what my wife needs. Yeah well, you just don't seem to get it. The most important thing to her, is that you are taken care of. And you're gonna do that? Well don't waste your time, my friend. I'm a real pain in the ass. [laughing] Yeah well, you give it your best shot. But, it's an act. And you know that after just an hour, huh? I know it because she's loved you for twenty three years. I'm not gonna be able to eat anything but yogurt 'til Easter. [everyone laughing] [Bruce] Turkey was delicious, mom. [Lisa] Art cooked the turkey. [Art] Um... anybody want another cappuccino? [Lisa] No thanks. [Sarah] Mom makes it too strong. Could I have some regular decaf? [Art] Sure, I'll put a pot on. [Sarah] Someone wanna tell us what's going on here? Who exactly is Art? [Bruce] Come on, mom, he's gonna be back in a second. Who is this guy? A friend. Your mom's business is really taking off. She's going all the time now. But... I mean is he... when we're not here... I'll say it. We've been worried since the hospital about you two breaking up. We're not breaking up. There's no big mystery here. Art helps me. He helps you. [Eric] She's looking for someone to help full time at work. It's a temporary problem. That's what your mother's saying. No, it's not temporary. I'm thinking of looking for a cheaper house. Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is not temporary? Mom? Honey, this is our home. A ranch would be better for you. You could get around easier. Be simpler for you to eat with us. With us? With the family. When you guys come home. Made you something. I had this windshield wiper hose in my truck. Great. Now you're gonna feed me through something you found in the back of your truck. I sterilized it. Now we can hang two bags before you go to bed. No more waking up during the night. Lisa changes them. She doesn't mind. No, she loves gettin' up in the middle of her nightly five hours. Real chance to do some husband and wife bonding. That was her on the phone? Yeah. Apple pie's are cooling. She'll be here when the mince meat's done. When the phone rings in my house, Art, I'll take the calls, got it? -Oh whatever you say. It's your house. -[machine beeping] You know that ranch house you saw, the one with the separate apartment? -[Lisa] I took it. -[pouring] Well I was thinking you know I'm paying eleven hundred a month here. How about, I move into that apartment. You'd save six hundred a month. Well I think it's worth more. But besides, I could also chip into my share of the food. Well that's what you want isn't it? It was your idea... [Lisa] My idea was a cheaper house. A ranch for the wheelchair. [Art] Well we spend all our time together anyway. Plus, when Mrs. Skinner's out, there'll be somebody in the house. You think about him more than I do. I like him more than I do. He's in an impossible situation. And you think having you living with us is gonna make things less impossible? Well, if I lived in the apartment, wouldn't it make things simpler? -[Art] Hhm? -[Lisa] No. Don't you understand... how hard it is having you near me and having to pretend? Pretend what? -That we're just friends. -* [romantic music] Fine. We'll keep things just the way they are. That feels wrong too. Like we've got some secret from him as if we're waiting for him to die. Honey, I don't think he's gonna die. Not anytime soon. [Lisa] The house is partially furnished. Look at that great tree. The apartment downstairs has its own bath. The kids rooms are twice what they are now. [Eric] I thought the apartment was for one of the kids? [Lisa] No I rented out the apartment. For eleven hundred a month. That means we're living here for fourteen hundred instead of twenty five hundred. [Eric] Who are the tenants? I hope they're not noisy. [Lisa] One tenant, Art. You're moving in the guy you're having an affair with? [Lisa] I'm not sleeping with Art. [Eric] Oh yeah right. [Lisa] Never lied to you, Eric, I never will. I'm not sleeping with Art. The word I used was 'affair', Lisa. You care to comment on that? Eric I promised to take care of you. That didn't mean I was giving up the right to take care of myself, or be happy. And he makes you happy. You admit that. -He's moving in. -* [dramatic music] * [dramatic music] [Lisa] Eric? Honey are you in here? He must be in his room. Wait here. [Art] Lisa! * [fast dramatic music] [car screeching and honking] [Driver] You ok? -[Art] You all right? -[Eric] Let go of my chair. -[Art] Here, get in here. -[Eric] I said let go of my chair! Did you hear what I said!? You go back into the house! [Lisa] We will go inside and talk about this-- -[Art] Eric... Eric... [-Eric] We're not gonna talk about anything! I'm out of here! -[Lisa] Hold on. What are you playing chicken with cars? -[Eric] I am going to Sarah's. She will get me an apartment! [Lisa] Would you come inside and talk about this like an adult? [Eric] No! No I wanna talk about it out here! So that all of our new neighbors can see what my wife and her boyfriend are doing to me! Look at' em! [Lisa] You're impossible and I'm freezing. Do whatever the hell you want. [Eric] That's what I intend to do. Where are you taking me? Where are you taking me?! -[bar noise] -[laughter, cauging] [Art] Way I see it, you've got the advantage now. She thinks you tried to kill yourself over her so, she'll do anything you want. That was the idea. It'll never occur to her that you couldn't stop because the uh, wheels were wet. What do you want? How can you let her move you into my house while I'm still alive? I want her to be happy. And you're willing to share her? [thumps chest] Yeah. What is this, the Popular Mechanics version of Jules and Jim? You're one weird guy, you know that? Well this is, uh, one weird situation. Ok. Here's the deal. There are some obvious financial advantages to having a tenant. As long as he sleeps in his own room. And some major drawbacks. Like what are the kids gonna think for example. Bottom line, he's willing to do stuff for me and I'm willing to let him stay. Why are you suddenly willing to look the other way? I guess I realized out there today that, you were right. I don't have any other choice. * [dramatic music] I can't help myself. I have to be near you. [Art] Lisa and I are flying up to Toronto for lunch. There's the number in case you need it. A few catalogs. -[Eric] Spending the night? -[Art] Ah no, no we wouldn't do that. Ah, you're, you're sure you got everything you need? [Eric] Yeah. -Buy her a nice lunch. -[Art] All right. I'll see ya. [boat engine, seagulls] You think it was ok we flew over here and left him? Oh he's fine, he's got a stack of catalogs he's doing his Christmas shopping. You've become the expert on my husband. Next he's gonna have you walking in bets for him. He can talk to me. That's no reflection on you. I'm just saying he takes advantage of people. I'm not the one who misses him. Coming over here was my idea. He know's we're here. He said have a good time. You're the one who's talking about him. [Art] Lisa, Lisa there's no reason if he builds up his strength he can't come over with us. I thought we came over here to be alone. [Art] You can't have it both ways. I mean we can do what we can to make him part of our lives and just start living and enjoy ourselves. Or we can work shifts nursing him and get off from what martyrs we are. But you and I can not organize our lives, exclusively around him. We have to have something else. Who told you you get to 'organize' what I feel about my husband. [plane engine] -[Art] Give a little bit of it. Let of it, let go-- -[Lisa] Stop giving me advice. [Art] I'm sorry I did not mean to sound like I was giving you advice. [Lisa] You do it all the time. You love him. Admit you love him. I can wait as long as it takes. Honey I can. I mean I'll do whatever, whatever. Just love me. Don't try to understand me. * [dramatic music] [news on T.V.] Oh, hi. Would you look cold. Would you like a cup of coffee? Why are you being so nice to me? "Love me. Don't try to understand me. I don't remember when I had an afternoon as bad as today. I was awful to you. You're right I can't have it both ways. I can't ask you to love me if I never let you see how I feel. * [romantic music] [snoring] [Lisa] Mrs. Skinner, is he asleep? Oh I ah checked him about half hour ago. He was reading that Tim Clancy. [Lisa] Tom Clancy.. Torn Clancy. It must be exciting he uh, told me he wanted to be alone. Heh heh. Ooh... Thank you for everything. -Oh, thank you. -We'll see you tomorrow. Night-night. -* [dramatic music] -[Lisa] You need anything before I got to bed? Eric? Mrs. Skinner call nine one one and Mr. Maskin at the station! [sirens] [paramedic] Watch your step ma'am... -[Art] Another stroke? -[Lisa] Heart attack, a bad one. [Art] Could have happened at any time. There's nothing you could have done if you'd been there. -[Art] Hi. -Where is he? [Art] Ah, he's having angioplasty. Where's mom? She's on the phone with the insurance company. They want a second opinion. All right, I gotta find her. Where is she? [Art] Uh, down by the cafeteria. What are you doing hanging around her? You have no right to be here. Right? I was here with your mom 'til you and Bruce could show up. Our father loves our mother. People see you hanging around, they think we're trash. Sarah, I know you're upset, but believe me nobody thinks your mother is trash. Why can't you just leave her alone? I can't take this. I thought you said the insurance wasn't gonna pay? They aren't. It doesn't matter. I'll borrow the money. Oh no you won't. You're starting to climb outta that hole you've been in all these years. Can we talk about money tomorrow? [Art] Sure. How's he doing? He's asleep. Carpenter thinks the procedure worked. [Art] Good. I'll go see him in the morning. What is Maxflight Enterprises and why are they willing to pay you all this money? [Art] We'll talk about money tomorrow. Art... It's um, Ted. He's a friend. Come on, you hungry? Let's get something to eat. Oh my God, you sold it. Hey if I wanna fly I'll rent a plane. No big deal. You love that plane more than anything. No, not more than anything. * [dramatic music] [Art] Boy, we're gonna have to start fattening you up. Hi Sarah, it's mom. Sorry I missed you again. Please, one of these days call me. [Lisa over answering machine] Daddy's good. The doctor's amazed at the progress he's making. And I want to talk to talk to you. The way we used to. I love you. [Lisa] Where's that salad bowl? [Art] Uh, I think it's up top. Art and I are talking about sneaking off to the track on Saturday while you're doing that wedding. You're not strong enough. Oh that doesn't matter. I'm the newest project now that the garbage cans have been secured. Why do you say things like that? Is that supposed to be a joke? You work. Art drives me around and looks after me. I might live forever. A lot of guys would be bothered having their wife's lover living under the same roof with them. Not me. I'm finding it very broadening. I never ever knew what was on sale at Trak Auto. How did I live? [laughing] Why are you doing this? "Wheel of Fortune", I never ever knew when that was on. He doesn't make fun of you. I'm not making fun of him! We're the two amigos! I just don't want the kids to find out and call him Uncle Art. Stop it! I'm warning you. [Eric] This is no way for two married people to live. -[Lisa] This is a way for me to survive. -[Eric] What about me? -[Lisa] You have a choice. Accept it or say no. -Oh there's a no-brainer. But if you say no, you're going to a home. I mean it, Eric. Will you skip the noble wifely crap! You would love to put me in a home. You just don't have the guts to do it. I don't have the guts? Art lives here. I live here. What you do is up to you. You're my wife. This is my house. This is my house. I signed the lease, I pay the rent. I want him out! * [dramatic music] [Lisa moaning in the other room] * [music swells] [door slams open] I'm putting myself in a home in the morning. * [dramatic music] Come over here. Nobody wants you to leave. How was it last night, Art. No performance anxiety I hope. [Art] I think Lisa and I think that we need to talk. Fine I'll start. I am not living in this house with you two anymore. That's not what we want. Last night was about you and me, about the argument we had. You said some things about Art that just sounded so, vicious. After all he's done for you. Well excuse me. I didn't mean to offend Saint Arthur. -[Art] Neither of us is proud-- -[Eric] Do you mind!? May my wife and I have a word without you sticking your oar in!? -He's just trying to help. -Well surprise, surprise he's not. All right then I'll say it. We are sorry, Eric. I am sorry. It was my idea. It was a cruel, bad, unnecessary thing to do. [Art] I agree. But Eric, no matter what happens the three of us are in this together. So... you two just imagine that I'm gonna let last night slide? I'd say that ninety percent of loving is forgiving the people you love. I like you, Art. But I will never ever love you. Ok? [Art] Nobody knows the rules here. Don't you see that? We're all just makin'em up as we go. Yeah I thought we were gonna try and figure out something that had the remote chance of making us all happy. Well then we're all gonna have to work at it. Yeah, what does that mean? That means you gettin' off your ass and showing her you're alive. You don't think she knows that after twenty three years? I think for twenty three years you've driven down to the mailbox when you could have walked. Now I think that you better prove to her that you can walk. Yeah well, when I really do get better, you may just lose her. Possible, yeah. You wanna bet? [laughs] You're on. What are you doing? Oh, trying to prove to somebody or other that I can walk to the mailbox. This is your idea? No, our roommates. Said if I made it he'd take me flying. He's got no plane. You told me had a plane. He sold it to pay for your operation. You ok here? Put your coat on. I'm taking you out for an early lunch. [Lisa] I've been to the bank. They'll loan me the down payment. What'dya think? Can you get it up in the air? [Art] Well uh, it'll take a little work. I gotta stick the wing back on and we'll pick up a new engine but... oh hell yes I can do it. Then we'll do it. As long as it takes. You promised. Promised what? You promised my husband a plane ride. * [light-hearted music] [Eric] Go on. [Art] There we go. A little up, a little more to your left. [Lisa] All right. Ok, good. Now just hold her there darling. How long do I have to hold this? Oh, hour, two. [Eric] Get down! [speaks inaudibly] [clink] [laughter] Eric, have you seen my carving knife, the serrated one! Honey are you in the bathroom! Eric! Honey are-- Lisa, she just dropped by. It was a surprise. She lose her voice? My God, I thought you had another attack. I'm surprised you didn't call Art with the good news. [Lisa] Sarah you're being childish. Is everyone else in town being childish too? Dad says not even Vivian talks to you anymore. All I care about is your father. He misses you and Bruce. -I'm here aren't I? -So am I. Yeah well, I don't insist on bringing my lover with me when I come. -Some day you'll understand. -* [dramatic music] That my mother was attracted to greasy finger nails? Why every wife has to invent her own life. Even if that means torturing your own husband? I'm staying with your father because he asked me to and because I love him. Art makes me able to do that. You admit that? That's what you don't understand. Love for two men. There's a name for women who do that. Huh? * [dramatic music] Ok, today's the day. Outside, both of you. * [dramatic music] [laughing] Goddamit we're going flying. -[Lisa] There it is. -* [playful music] [Eric] That looks great. Oh hey no wheelchair. You said I had to walk and I'm gonna walk. Here take that. This thing doesn't even look used. [Art] Well Lisa sanded every inch of it. [Eric] I don't know. An airplane just doesn't seem like the ideal do-it-yourself project. [laughing] We sure this things gonna fly? [Art] No not really. We'll find out. [laughing] [Eric] So where are you taking me tonight? [Art] Lisa and I wanna show you something special. [Eric] You're not gonna throw me out or anything are you? [Art] No. Not that it hasn't occurred to us. [Eric] Ok. -[Art] Ready? -[Eric] Yeah. -[Art] Fingers and toes. -[Eric] Ok. * [inspirational music] [Eric] Wow! [Lisa] Isn't this spectacular? This is damn special. Worth everyone of those steps. I think. We thought of it on our first date. Oh please, give me break. Ok not exactly the first date but later when things changed, we knew we had to show it to you. Yeah, yeah. You just needed someone to hold the stick while you two neck. Not a bad idea. Come on, take over. Ha ha ha ha. Hey straighten it out. Straighten it out! [Eric] Art! Art! [laughter] Ok let go, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it. Eric it was never right without you. [laughter] [electric shaver] [Art sighs] Hey, how about you and me go see if the mail's come in? You go. Wanna drive me tomorrow. Get a racing form. Bring one back for me. Oh come on you're acting like an old geezer. Old geezer's have a way of knowing when it's time. [Art laughs] You keep an eye on those falls for me, will you buddy? [Art crying] We have to go to the hospital now. [Eric] Thanks. [Lisa] I haven't finished yet. [Eric] For giving me six months longer than I had any reason to expect. [Lisa] You know why cannibals don't eat clowns? [Eric] No, why? [Lisa] They taste funny. [Eric laughs] I could always make you smile. Someday when you and Sarah are watching our grandchildren play, you tell her something. Tell her that she and Bruce and all the others that cut us off, they really missed something. They missed a chance at one percent of what we had. I'm glad you have somebody to love. And I'm, I'm so sorry I'm such a lousy husband. You were the best husband, for so many years. * [sad music] You were a great father. The kids are going to be just fine. In seventy six, you made me laugh. [laughing] Remember the one about the wand and the donut holes. [laughing] It took guts all of it. A life in the movies. Living the way we have. Making it to the mailbox. The mailbox. You're crazy. No. No, I'm not crazy. I love you. I love you too. Tell the kids... that more than anything when this earth... * [sad dramatic music] * [somber music] [Sarah crying] Let's go home and have some lunch together. Got any party food you need to move? I was thinking something simple. A pasta, with one of your dad's favorite sauces. I can't eat in that house today, mom. * [somber music] * [light music] [Art] What'dya got there? He always liked looking at that apple tree. * [light happy string music] * [Multicom Entertainment Group jingle]
