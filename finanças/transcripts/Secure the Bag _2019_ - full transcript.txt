You are doing the same mess you did when you were a little boy. Just stop. Didn't you get tired of your daddy whipping your butt for taking stuff that didn't belong to you? My daddy only beat me because he was drunk. Your father gave up his hopes and his dreams for himself, for you. He was always gone. He was never there. He was working hard to make money to take care of the debt that you made. Well maybe. If he was at home working hard to be a father then it never would've happened. Don't you put that on him. Do not blame him for that. You were too greedy. You're too lazy to earn it and too greedy to let it go. We did not teach you that. I gotta use the bathroom. Man are you serious? Man, I gotta pee.

You have another female up in here? No, I don't have another. Look, it's just not a good time right now. What? It was just a disagreement. Why didn't you tell me to leave? I'm so sorry. What is he looking for anyway? I don't know. Well ask him. Ask him and give it to him. Maybe then he'll leave. I mean, we haven't seen his face yet. Hey man. Look, don't eat my food. Look, I can get you some jewelry if you could leave. We haven't seen your face or heard your voice so we can't say anything. Look man, just don't eat my food, bruh.

Just give him what he wants. Please I don't have it. Please stop it. No, I don't know what you're talking about. Just give him the money. How did you know that it was money that he was talking about? What else would it be? He put on his hand where is it? He never even said a word. It's only on his hand. Where is it? How'd you know that it was money? No. No. No. No. No, no, no, no. No. No. No. No. No. Wake up sleepyhead. Oh you wanna know how you got in this condition? Alright I'll talk to you. I'll tell ya, I'll tell ya. In Charlotte, North Carolina there was a little girl and she saw her mom get dogged by men until one day she met this good guy. For two years he was wonderful with the kids. Supportive. Then my mom inherited a house. And he convinced her to sell it and then stole all her money and from that point on that little girl decided that all men were thieving dogs. Let me go, please. I'd love to let you go. I mean I'll let you go. You just need to do one thing for me. Give me the money. I didn't take anything. I promise. What's that saying? Once you steal from me, you'll lie to me. Six months ago a bank was robbed for a whole lot of money and my boyfriend told me that he hid the money in the vents in the Marcus building and when I went and got to the building, I noticed that your company was there cleaning out the HVAC systems. So when I went and I looked, guess what? The money was gone. So I followed your company. To the company 'cause I knew that one of you guys had to have the money, but next thing I know you quit your job. Then your lifestyle really changed 'cause you went and got you a Mercedes Benz. So no job and you got a Mercedes Benz. So you went from bike to Mercedes Benz with no job. Now if that ain't magic, I don't know what is. I don't have it. Oh okay. Okay, we're still playing this, okay. I'm gonna need you to tell me where the money is. I don't know. Bae. I don't have it. What are you? What? You're a flunky. What's that? You're ready to talk? Alright let's go. You're her flunky. What? You just do whatever she says. Nigga shut up for I crush you. Is he really getting to you? Nah. Flunky. Bae, go check the rest of the house. Now. Okay, we gotta get out of here. What are you talking about? You thought that was real? Oh gosh. How does he know who you are? I'll talk about it later. I'm trying to get us out of here. Oh I love you. I made that whole thing up. But anyway love you, too. What are you doing? Try harder. But why don't you tell me where the money is so that we'll have some leverage? What are you? You think I'm stupid? You think I'm stupid. You're full of it. You trying to play me for a fool, too? Bae. Bae, what are you talking about? I almost had the money. She was about to run away with me and the money. Shut up. Bae, it's about me and you. You're her flunky. Just her flunky. Shut up. Both of you. I killed for you and this is how you gonna do me? Bae. Shoot her. Bae. Bae. If it wasn't for us, I mean I wouldn't even be here. I came here to make sure you were okay. She can't be trusted. Shoot her. Bae, I love you. I need you. No. Stop being her flunky. Shoot her. Bae. Flunky. I'm ready. For what? For you to put a baby in me. Huh? Now? Where's the gun? Why? So you can go find out where the money is. Do you believe in God? Sometimes. Sometimes? I heard that people start believing in God when they hit rock bottom because they feel like there's nowhere else to turn. You wanna know what I believe? No. I believe that you don't have to necessarily hit rock bottom to believe. It's pain. You can have all the money in the world and still feel alone. You can have all the money in the world and feel unfulfilled and feel empty inside. And even with all that money never getting the answers that you were looking for. And that pain makes you search for the truth. What are you saying? What I'm saying is it's not hitting rock bottom. It's the pain. And the pain that can help you and me get to the truth. What? Stop I don't know. I don't know where it is. Oh. You can do me one favor. And you can actually tell me where it is. I don't know. Please, I don't know. Okay it's alright. I got you. No stop please. I don't know where it is. I don't know. Please no. No, no. Please don't. I don't know where it is. I don't know. Please. Please, please, please. I don't know where it is. Where's the money? I don't know. Please I don't know where it is. Alright. Please. Where's the money? I don't know. Lies, lies, lies, lies. Ah! Okay. Okay, I'll tell you. I'll tell you where it is. I'll tell you. I'll tell you where it is. Oh you will? Yes. Okay. Bae. It's in the kitchen. Hand me the gun. Why? So you can drag him into the kitchen. You're right. Good idea. Okay. Alright. It's right here. It's right here. Here. $20,000. That's all I got. $20,000. Where's the rest of it? I spent it. Let's just take the $20,000 and get out of here. I didn't go through all that for $20,000. $20,000. Stacks is gonna kill me. Stacks? I thought that this was for me and you. I killed for you. I knew I shouldn't have trusted you. We're having a baby together. Well, I guess that means I have two plan B's. The pill and this. Aw baby. Don't fight it. I'll see you in hell soon. I really could've loved you, but couldn't have any evidence left behind and you shouldn't have taken the money. Don't do it. Please don't do it. Please. We gotta get you some help. No. No. She tried to kill you. Accusing you of taking money from some robbery. Ah man. I gotta at least call the cops. No cuz, no. Okay. At least let me get you some ice for the bruises. I'ma need your help. Port City welcome back to your Hot 97 and I have some I don't wanna say good but interesting news about the robbery. There are two new suspects. A Stanley Fisher and a Brooke Johnson have been arrested. They are also being charged with two murders behind the robbery of the bank, but out of all that money they only had $20,000 left. This is the crazy part. They had the police looking for a Daniel Key, but the police said that person does not exist. This is a shame and it's sad to see, you know two women period you know of color go through this. So I'm not trying to make light of this any situation or any joke anything. Greed man. Greed is serious. And not to get religious but greed it's spiritual and the things we put in our minds, the things we watch, the music we listen to influence and feeds that spirit and that's just not a good spirit. There's nothing wrong with having things and having money, but greed is something totally different. It's idolatry when you put money before your life, other people's lives, you put it before your relationship with God, and don't forget it's not money is not the root of all evil. It's the love of money. I'm sorry. Bro, I'm disappointed in you, man. You put your life on the line. My life. I'm sorry. You had us in that house knowing the money was in there. You gave us the keys. Don't tell me you sorry. Tell Unc. You know I never meant for either of you to get hurt. What more is it to life? I mean what's the point of living life and then dying broke? Our parents used to have us sitting up in that room for weeks eating those nasty beans just to afford some private school. Some private school that used to mistreat us because we were black. I hated that life. I wasn't going back. Cuz, I didn't say that I enjoyed eating those nasty behind beans and I also didn't say that being broke is okay. I need you to understand that money is a tool. It's not God. It's all about how we use it not how it uses us. People always get it mixed up that money is the root of all evil. No, it's the love of money that's the root of all evil and until you understand that, you're never gonna live a life that's worth living. Bull crap. How do you think that you're here right now? Luck. Luck? It's because of God that you're here right now this very moment. And until you understand that, you will never fulfill your life's purpose. Son. I have missed you.
