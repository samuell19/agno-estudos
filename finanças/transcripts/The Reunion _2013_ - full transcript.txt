- Do we have any more bottle openers? - I'm on it. Are the outdoor candles lit? - Malle? - Hi! - Wow! Great to see you! - This is so exciting! - Do you think everyone will come? - I hope so. - That would be so awesome! - Hello? Hi! There are drinks at the bar, so help yourselves. - You're looking great! - You too. Really! - Have you seen who's here? - Lena! I must say hello to her! Hi. It's been ages. - Anders! - Niklas! - How's it going? - Just fine! - Nice to see you! - You remember Fredrik S? - You look great! - And you've just had a baby! Look who it is! - May I? When are you due, tonight? - Three weeks to go. Ok, everyone, listen up! It's party time! Come forward, that's it! It's great to see so many faces tonight! - Cheers, everyone! - Cheers! As you know, it's been 20 years, since we left school... and, judging by appearances, you can tell! I think we should thank the three guys, who made this reunion happen. You know who I'm talking about. Anders, Erik, Ulf! Thank you, lads! Good initiative, good choice of toastmaster! - Cheers! - Cheers! It'd be great if some of you said a few words about our happy years together. - Cheers! And welcome! - Cheers! Let's party! Do you know where you're sitting? - Hi. - Hi, Anna. Welcome! Good to see you. Robban's just welcomed everyone, so... - It's been what, 20 years? - Yep, 20 years. - We were just talking about Robban. - Is he here? Yes. He's the toastmaster. - Would you like a drink? - I'd love one. The bar's over there. Nice to see you here! - Hi! - Hi! Camilla! It's been ages. How's life? It's good. THE REUNION Subtitle: sync, fix: titler PART 1 THE SPEECH - Cheers! - Cheers! - You can't get tired of London. - Well, after 15 years, you know... - Nobody else? - No. That's why it's great to meet up. Didn't you use to hang out with Robban? To think that we effectively grew up together, and that we get to meet here, now, 20 years later. I've thought a lot about, the hierarchy that existed in our class. And about how the time we shared shaped us. Why some of us were cool, while others were losers. Did we get these positions... entirely by chance? The reason for us meeting tonight is that we were classmates for nine years. I'd like to say a few words about what those years were like for me. I found it a constant struggle. This isn't about pointing fingers... but about my need to say now what I couldn't say then. I was the butt of the jokes, the one who got shoved. The outcast, the one you all hoped to avoid. I became a loser. I saw myself the way many of you saw me. Preferably not at all. In those days bullying was considered harmless. "It's just kids being kids. " But we weren't just kids to each other. I'm not blaming you. Ultimately, of course, it was the fault of our teachers, or maybe our parents. But I believe it was my fault too for not, giving up, for constantly trying to fit in. Yet at the same time I realised... as time went by, that something was wrong with me. Like the rest of you. I also wanted to avoid Anna Odell. Nine years together is a long time. And now we're grown up. After all, we were just kids back then. And today, I feel like I'm a person again. Thank you, Anna! Indeed, we were only children back then, but now we're adults. And... that's such a relief! Let's thank the great artist for her contribution! Cheers! - Cheers! - Cheers! Bottoms up! Wine! More wine... She just got up and left. - Hi! How are you? - I'm fine. God, I'm shocked, I have to say. I had no idea... I just wanted to... say what I couldn't say back then. I think that's great. Honestly, I mean it. It's so easy to just be, like, "Oh, what fun we had... " I particularly remember how the teachers were so... hard on you, weren't they? Mr Matsson... I don't know, I mostly remember how... Especially the boys... - Anders hasn't even said hi to me. - Hasn't he? Hi there, Anna! You're exactly like I remember you. You know, odd. I mean, it wasn't your everyday speech, now, was it? Right, Minna? I was just telling Anna that... I liked it! And that art project too! Was that suicide thing really so sensible? You used up resources that other people need for real. Damn, anyone got a tampon? Sorry! Not me! - Rikard! - Perfect timing! - There's Ulf... - It sure is! You're so fucking old! - There's food, so just take a seat! - Awesome! - Hi! - What's up? Minna! - Hello! - You look great, I've missed you. Hi! Can't wait for the food! Well, I'll keep it brief... It's time for a speech from one of our wonderful hosts, so let me hand you over to Anders. Camaraderie. That's what I feel was... the linchpin of our class. I mean, we're sitting here together after all these years. Some things bonded us as a group more than others. I'm thinking of that hiking trip we did. With tents and whatnot. I remember, we had four or five new couples after that trip! Holding hands... Mind you, we were in year six, so everyone had broken up a week later! And that night, we sat around a campfire by the lake. Robban... You wanted to show everyone how to carve wood with the knife towards you! - It's possible! - It's possible! A few times! - But it hurts like hell! - It hurt like hell. You cut your thumb so bad, that it bled and bled... And you just laughed! And, shit. That's what I like about you, Robban. No matter what happens, you just laugh it off. No matter how hard you fall, you just get right back up with a smile on your face. - That's what I like about you. - A toast to the toastmaster! Rikard. He was already trying to break gender barriers in year nine, by insisting on putting his name forward to be the school's prom queen! Pure feminism on my part! Absolutely. You claimed to meet all the criteria. You wrote on the blackboard. "Long Hair. Sexy. Rikard equals prom queen". That's true. I thank you all for your support! I have so many... I have so many memories from those days, and I'll close by saying that... it was a simple and innocent time. And... when I'm caught up with family life and my career, it's these times that I often look back on. And if there's one thing I wish for my own kids, it's that they experience the same sense, of camaraderie that we had. - Cheers, and thank you! - Cheers! Straight to the heart, Anders! Straight to the heart! Let's keep on partying! Anders! Anders! I think we have different memories... of our wonderful camaraderie. I can't recall you ever once, during this time, in any way acknowledging my existence. Despite being the host for this party... you've neither greeted nor even looked at me. You're finding it awkward me talking to you now, aren't you? You don't like it, do you? Come on, Anna, it's a party. It said so on the invite. "Party"! - It is a party! But surely I can say... - This isn't class therapy. It's a party. I recall our wonderful camaraderie during that hiking trip. How you boys, especially Niklas, Ulf... Erik, David and Rikard, worked hard for days to convince me that... Rikard was in love with me. And, fool that I was, because I so wanted to be part of this class... "Maybe it's true, maybe he is in love with me. " Then we're standing there one night, on the rocks. And, Niklas, you owned up to your little prank. "How could you be so stupid to think that Rikard is in love with you?" And I tried to play it cool. "Of course I didn't believe you. " I tried to laugh it off, saying, "Is that funny?" Is that funny, Ulf? Because that was your usual line, which you always said and which I stole. Or what was it that pissed you off so much when I said it that you had to... - Do you remember what you did? - No. What did I do? You kicked me hard in the crotch, which you others found hilarious. Remember? I think you and I have conflicting memories or conflicting perspectives on our camaraderie, Anders. - We get it now, Anna. - And Erik. Erik, do you remember middle school? What you used to say to me? - Do you remember? - No. "If I looked like you, I'd kill myself. " "Can't you just go home and oblige, so we don't have to look at you?" Do you want to know the only reason why I didn't do it? I was afraid you'd mock my corpse even more without its layers of makeup. Anna, this isn't really the right forum for digging up... Forum? What is the right forum? Only happy memories, is it? You can contact them afterwards if there are things you need to process... And you, girls, do you remember? There weren't many of us, and each dining table had six seats. If I was lucky enough to turn up before everyone had sat down... Well, then, it was already taken. "But I was first, how come I don't get to join you?" - Sorry, but... - Can I finish?! So if I sat down anyway, well, then, I was a bitch, because why should Camilla have to sit all alone at another table? If I refused to move, you'd change tables. - So you wouldn't have to sit alone. - We were kids, Anna! - Yeah, just kids. - Yes, we were. We were kids, all of us. Remember when someone was sick? When there was room? Well, then, someone's imaginary friend was sitting there. Then there were the days when I gave up... and went to sit somewhere else. But when you're sitting alone, you're more exposed. Forgive us. We can dance and talk later, but please let's enjoy the party. I remember that you... Do you remember? You even asked me out when you were new to the class. But you learned, from the others, I guess, that it wasn't cool. That it was wrong to be with Anna Odell. That's how cool you were. Right? Did you know that Rikard and I were together one weekend? - Congratulations. - You even wanted to have sex. "We can have pretend sex!" We were in year two! That's enough, Anna! Find somewhere else to rant! Rant? Sorry, but can I finish, please? - If it makes you feel better... - Feel better? - It's not exactly uplifting... - I want to tell you how it felt. I couldn't say it then. I never got a word in because you'd all laugh at me! Maybe that's slipped your mind? Why come here if you're so angry at us? No one forced you to. We're all here because we wanted to come. You're being selfish too, because we're here to enjoy ourselves. Just call the people you're upset with and go for a coffee... - Sure! I bet you'd love that! - I'd be happy to meet you later. Maybe we could go out? What the hell is all this? Remember the Secret Sisters, Cecilia and Lena? They were like a single bloody entity. Remember? So what? We were friends. If one of you was sick, then I got to play with you, and we'd have fun. Remember? And what about your "friendship contract"? - What do you want us to say? - For life! Remember? Where do husbands and kids fit into your lifetime contract? Come on, Anna, let's talk outside. - Can't I even say my piece? - I know what you mean, Anna. I feel terrible about this. I know what you mean, I understand you. More wine. Please! Do you even remember how you told me that my presence polluted your study time. That I should go home? That I ruined it for everyone. Do you remember? Do you... All I can do is apologise, Anna. What else do you want me to say? - I've also had to live with this. - You've felt bad? - Yes, about what I did. - Poor you. - Can't you just accept that? - I don't know what to say, Anna. - It's party, party, party... - Erik, you're needed inside. - You'll have to finish your chat later. - We're off outside for a smoke. - Got the smokes, Rikard? - Come on, Minna, let's talk old times! - I'll be right back. - Let's go, come on! This is so fucked up. - The artist... - The makeup's gone, at least! - She was cute! - She was a wreck. - A little weird, but cute. Funny. - Cute? Don't know about that... She looks good. Minna, I've always loved you. - If it wasn't for that... - If it wasn't for that... I'd almost have hoped you were divorced! But, Jesus, really, why do such a thing? Why deliberately spoil the mood after such a speech as Anders gave? I think it's... bloody stupid. - I'll never forget this party. - Me neither. You remember that hiking trip, that she talked about in there? When we convinced her I was in love with her? - You did that? - And I can do it again. It'll be fun. I'll do it again. I'll do it again. - Go and do it, then! - 100 kronor. She'll lap it up! We had a laugh together, but it was really hard going at times. You'd never say anything. It wasn't that easy! But, then again, it was brave of you to bring it up. - It'll calm everyone down again. - You want me to bet 100 kronor? I'll cheer her up, I promise. She'll be like... a kitten in my hands! - Like you. Like you were in school. - Who, me? Every time I touched you, you purred like a little cat! Just kidding! - I'm cold. - I'm freezing to death. Hey! Good luck. No sweat. She doesn't stand a chance. - Look at you, sitting here waiting for me! - Rikard... I've got to get warm. I need to sit down. Feel how cold I am, Anna. - You're frozen! - I need body heat! - Rikard, you're pissed! - No way, I've been on apple juice! You've drunk too much. Yeah, right, apple juice. Look, couldn't you go and get me and Anna a drink? We need to have a little chat. Is it going all right? - Does it seem all right to you? - Yeah. Sure. - You think I'm crazy, don't you? - No, I like you, Anna. Always have. Always. It's true. Do you remember the hiking trip? You mentioned it in there... It's ok. I've always... It's ok. I was in love with you, Anna. I was. I was. I just didn't dare admit it. You're beautiful... Look. Everyone wanted to throw you out. They were mad at you. But I thought you did really well. Really damn well. - You reckon? Fun, was it? - It was. It was great! Something happened! You deliberately stirred things up! I thought your reaction was... - You said therapy, right? - Sure, it's like therapy... Have you been in therapy? I went once. With my... - I have two kids. - You took your kids? Was it tough? Things were messy. But therapy's good. I've always liked you. Fancy going up onto the roof with me to look at the stars? Would you like that? - He's such a smoothie. - I know! Rikard always has been. He can take anyone and just... Let's party, eh? Dance... Get crazy... Let's get crazier than those idiots in there. What do you say? You and me... I'm on your side. Come on, let's dance. It's party time! Hey. Photo-model, five shots! An apple juice too. And a Virgin Bourbon for Minna. Minna, Minna, it's party time. It's party time! And we're one big happy family! Right. Here you go! And here, and here... Here's to the good ol' days! Here's to the good ol' days! - Cheers! - Cheers! Minna! Christ, how I've missed you! I've missed you so damn much! Minna! Minna, come here! - Love you. - Love you too. Tell us, wasn't it you two with that fire, or whatever it was... You owe me 100 kronor! You owe me 100 kronor! It was exactly like on the hiking trip! She fell for it! She's so desperate! This is so cool! Mix this guy a drink with a little of everything! Make it two... - Am I interrupting? - Not at all! Because... I don't really know, what to make of you. We had a great time when we were kids, don't you think? We had a great time! We'd dress up at Easter together, remember? You were so good at drawing Easter cards! Rikard called me "Anna the Planner", remember? But in actual fact, you were the careful one. I drew the cards because I could draw and you coloured them in, perfectly! I was so careful. You'd done them so well! So I'd take an eraser and make the edges perfect! People loved those cards! Why was it so important to only be two? - How come, how did... - It was all three of us too! It was only if one of you was sick that it was... We were at that "best friends" phase, as I recall. I can't remember that much... You and me could play, but when Cecilia was there, it was all friendship contracts. You thought it was OK for me to join in, didn't you? Sure, and you did join in. I don't see why you're going on about this. It just feels like you're a bit cautious, a bit pathetic. You're a coward. That's what I think. Why do you have to talk about this now, at a party? I think it's fun to be here, seeing everyone again. But when would we talk about it? It's been 20 years. Who'd want to? You'd never meet me if I called you. I would, but you never have! - But you and Cecilia meet up? - Sure, we do... But you were the real losers, weren't you? You were the losers! You weren't popular. - You were pathetic cowards. - Cecilia and I were on your side! I don't get why you're having a go at me like this! - I'm not. We had fun. - Exactly! So why get at me? I'm not getting at you. I just want to hear you out. Get your side of it! Hey, what's up? What's wrong? Is it Anna? Enough's enough, Anna. What the hell are you playing at? Playing at? I just wanted to talk to Lena. - That's enough now, Anna! - Lena! Lena! Lena? - May I speak with her, please? - Didn't you hear? I said enough. - Get your coat and go home. - Go home? - Go home. - Lena, I just want... - Can't I just ask you how you felt... - Anna! Show some respect for the guys who arranged the party. - Drop it. - Enough's enough. Am I infectious or something? Lena!? - She doesn't want to talk to you. - Why won't you listen? - Keep her away from Lena. - Why won't you listen to us? I just want to hear your side! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Lena! Lena! - Go home now. - She doesn't want to talk to you! She doesn't want to discuss your problems with you! You're the ones with the problems! It's OK to talk to me now, is it? Can you get out of my way? - Get out of here! - It's OK to talk to me now, is it? - That's enough! - Are you sticking your oar in now? She doesn't want to talk to you, Anna! Go! Take it easy now. Calm down. Calm down. OK? Just cool it. You can see it in her eyes. She's fucked up in the head. What was that? - You're talking about me. - You're not well, Anna. - I'm not well? - No, you're not. So what should I do now? Go home and kill myself because I'm so ugly? And then what? - Get a grip and get out! - Take your hands off me! - Wait! Wait! - Let go of me! Calm down, then. Come on, calm down, Anna. Sorry! Sorry! - You fucking nutcase! Get out of here! - Let's get you out, come on. I can go by myself! Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Let me go by myself. I don't want your fucking hands touching me. - Can someone get Anna's coat? - Call a taxi! OK, I'm going. I'll go. But not as long as you keep glaring at me. Back off. Come on guys, back off. - I will. - Good. Do so then. Go. I will. But by myself, I won't be thrown out by a bunch of arseholes. - Arseholes? - Don't touch me! - Don't touch me, I'm leaving. - Good. So, now you can go and get your coat. What the fuck? Let me go! You fucking... Let me go, you... Grab her legs! - Open the door! - Let me go! Go and get her things! - The taxi's here. - Come on, let's go. What a total fucking nutter! Could we have some music, please? OK? OK? I'm sorry. We clearly shouldn't have invited everyone to this party. It was a disaster. It's art. - Hello, Louise speaking. - Hi, it's Anna Odell. - Anna, hi! How are you? - Fine. Listen... - I'm working on a film. - That's great! Is it fiction or... Yes, it's a fiction film, about a class reunion. The reason I'm calling is that, I'd like to show it to the whole class. I see... Henrik speaking. - Hello, this is Anna Odell. Is this Henrik, who went to Enskede school? - Yes. - Hi! - Hi... - It's been a while... - Indeed. Time flies. Yes, it does. I'm calling because I've made a film about a class reunion. I was wondering if you'd like to see it... with Christopher, if he wants to. - Sure, of course. - That's great. - Christopher... - Hey, it's Anna Odell. - Hi! - Hi! I spoke to Henrik yesterday, and... Yes, I know. I see. So I guess he called you? - Yes, we've talked. - Ok. I was just wondering if you wanted to meet up, the three of us... Well, yes... What's it about? I'd like to show you my film, and hear your opinions... But if you've already made the film, why meet us now, rather than before... when you were starting on it? Because... What I'm wondering is why you didn't come to the reunion. It would've been... Because I didn't know there was a reunion. You didn't know? I only heard about it afterwards. - What, weren't you invited? - No. I didn't get an invitation, anyway. But sure, of course I'd be happy to help you... It's just that I enjoy my life as it is, and I don't want it disrupted by stuff like this. Your other project caused such a stir... It would really mean a lot to me... - Henrik speaking. - Hi, it's Anna Odell. - Hi. - Christopher has agreed to meet up. Thanks for the offer, but I'm afraid I have to turn you down. - How come? - I just want to say; No thanks, and end this. But may I just ask you what made you change your mind? - I'd prefer not to discuss it. - OK. I've given your last call some thought, and decided that my answer is: "No, thank you. " Goodbye. What do you hope to get out of the meeting? I have no expectations of them, only that we meet. I'd never look these people up just for my own sake. It's because this is a project. That's what makes me... call them up. But, of course, like everyone else, I've wanted to... somehow say that this or that upset or hurt me, but I'd never do that. It's not the done thing. But, I wanted to find out what happens when you actually do it. When you do what you normally wouldn't do otherwise. PART 2 THE MEETINGS - Here. - Thanks. Whoops! Don't worry, I've got it. - Sorry about that. - It happens. I filled the cup too much. I'll just give this a wipe. - Help yourself to a sandwich. - Thanks! I'm glad you could make it. I can't say that I remember much from our class back then. I had a lot going on outside school. I was very focused on sports. I had other friends outside school, and... I never really had any problems in school. I had fun. I liked our class. I enjoyed it. But I have my own idea of what I was like, and it would be interesting to hear... what impression you had of me. I'll get to that. But first I thought I'd show you the film. Because... In the film, I've been invited. So it's like, "What if?" What if I'd been there? What were you all trying to avoid? - Are we going to watch it now? - Yes. Then we can talk afterwards. I'll just dim the lights. - Do we have any more bottle openers? - I'm on it. Are the outdoor candles lit? - Malle? - Hi! - Wow! Great to see you! - This is so exciting! ...it's these times that I often look back on. And if there's one thing I wish for my own kids, it's that they experience the same sense of camaraderie that we had. - Cheers, and thank you! - Cheers! Anders! Anders! I think we have different memories, of our wonderful camaraderie. I can't recall you ever once, during this time, in any way acknowledging my existence. Despite being the host for this party, you've neither greeted nor even looked at me. It's OK to talk to me now, is it? Can you get out of my way? - Get out of here! - It's OK to talk to me now, is it? - That's enough! - Are you sticking your oar in now? She doesn't want to talk to you, Anna! Go! I'll just turn the lights back on. That was... exciting to see. In reality, I'd never have pushed it so far, but... No, I get it. It's your artistic choice, I suppose. Yeah, or rather, I guess I see it more as... I wondered, since you didn't invite me, what you were all trying to avoid. So I pushed it beyond everyone's boundaries. But what's your impression of me? As I saw it, you and Henrik, were at the top of the hierarchy, and... Yeah, but... To me, somehow... you were the worst guys. I understand... if that... seems unfair. It's just that you always had such high status, and totally ignored me. What's interesting is that I have no recollection of being nasty to you. - Yet you say I was one of the worst. - No, but that... But I can understand that Henrik... If anyone could be called a real bully, it was him. He'd hit and shout at me and fuck around with me, while you were the nice guy, but you stayed loyal to the bullies. I'm not placing the blame back on you, but on the situation. You were in your situation, and I was in mine... Because I'd never give it a second thought if someone was ignoring me. I felt I was bullied terribly... for the entire time I was at school. This is the first conversation we've ever had together. Isn't it? Yeah, perhaps. But did Christopher recognise himself in the film? It was weird. He didn't say anything or ask which one was him. - Maybe he was afraid to. - What could he say? - "Which one of those arseholes is me?" - Or he quickly realised... - I'm just as crazy... - You're the craziest! Did anyone like you calling them? - Yeah. - That guy did. What's his name? Peter. - Was he in the film? - I'll show you. - One of the girls was happy you called. - Kristina. Both her and Peter were curious about why I'd called. That's Peter right there. How many have you got hold of? What can it be? Eight? Seven or eight, so far. It's Anders! - Hello! - Hi! - Hi. Nice to see you. - You too. - How are you? - Just fine. Hi there. Good to see you. So you're here too? Yeah. I'm helping Anna with ideas for the script. How far have you got? We've started by contacting them. It's going a bit slow. They don't show up. They agree to meet, but then suddenly fall sick. How exciting. Have you met my character? How was that? It went really well, actually. - Did he get to see the film? - Sure. - I'd love to join you, but I have to... - Coffee? - No. I'm fine. - No? - I have to go. I just came for my jacket. - Yeah? - See you. - Bye. You know, Anna, that today you're up here. In a sense, perhaps. I think it goes both ways. I mean, all these... They still see me as the loser too. I doubt it. You're making a film of your past. You're a public figure with art projects. Of course, they don't see you down there. That's more a lingering feeling in you. OK, so it's not like a documentary. No, it's pure fiction. Cool! It sounds exciting. Sure, we can meet. Absolutely. Can't you call Sanna, and then we can touch base after that? - Hello, Sanna speaking. - Hi, this is Anna Odell. - Hi! - Hi. How are things? - Fine. Yourself? - Fine. I've just spoken to Linda. I'm working on... I'm out walking with a friend, - so I can't talk right now. So... - OK. - But... - Could you call me back in a few hours? Hello, you've reached Sanna's voicemail. Leave a message after the beep. This is so hard! I had to go home and shower, just to like... - Before you came? - Yes! My God... Dare we take a sandwich? I don't know. What's on them? Is it ham? Are they edible? What if they're poisoned? Here you go. I remember that your mum was there sometimes. - Yes. - We had meetings. - Yes. - With the school nurse or someone. Just us girls. - What kind of meetings? - I don't know. I don't really recall either. I remember getting the feeling, that we'd done something, but didn't quite know what. - At least, that's how I remember it. - So, what were the meetings about? They were about the fact we were a threesome... You mean you didn't want to be a threesome? I don't know, but there was a lot of talk about how we couldn't be a threesome. Although, I don't really remember feeling that way. The three of us played together too, but sometimes, you played alone. I found it hard to be with you at times. We couldn't tell if you wanted to join in. I've thought a lot about the hierarchy that existed in our class, and about how the time we shared shaped us. I found it a constant struggle. This isn't about pointing fingers, but about my need to say now what I couldn't say then. Cecilia and Lena. They were like a single bloody entity. Remember? So what? We were friends. If one of you was sick, then I got to play with you, and we'd have fun. Remember? And what about your "friendship contract"? - What do you want us to say? - For life! Remember? Where do husbands and kids... Oh my God! Why has she done this? - It feels really weird. - Really weird. Who do you think I am? - I don't know. - I think I'm... - No, that's me. - I thought it was me. - What does she want? - No idea. You can't just rationalise like this. We were kids! What shall we say? It's an incredibly emotional film, really. - I didn't even want to go to the reunion. - No, me neither. - So how was it? - I was one of the first to leave. You didn't miss anything. No, really. I don't actually know why I went in the first place. But... I've talked to a lot of our old classmates... And they told me that you helped with the invites. Me? No way! How strange that they said that. It's absolutely untrue. Honestly. - It's not true. - No. I mean, we talked in advance... and I had contact with someone on Facebook, but I had absolutely nothing to do with the invites. - It's just what I've been told. - Well, it certainly isn't true. This may seem like an accusation, but it's only because I'm curious. When I call people the first time, they answer. But when I call them again, they don't pick up. What do you think that's about? Speaking for myself. I find it tiring to talk on the phone in the evening. With everybody, not just you. - It's nothing personal. - No. I usually don't answer if I don't recognise the number. I just didn't recognise your number and didn't answer. I can imagine Louise backing out because of what happened in the past towards you. I imagine it felt scary having to meet you, not knowing what you'd do to her. I'm only speaking for myself, but if I had to guess, maybe that's why. Look, I spoke to Linda on the phone before coming here. So if you tell me I was mean to you, then I give in completely. Because... I know I could be a bit of a wind-up back then. So if you say I was nasty to you. then I hold my hands up. You weren't at the latest reunion. Was that a deliberate decision? I wasn't... I never got an invitation. - Sure you did. - No. - You must have. - I didn't. - Why would I make it up? - Really? Who was in charge of the invites? We... I was the one who arranged it all. I was there discussing it with them. - Who? - Me, Louise and Linda. We met up, and then called the ones they were in touch with... Linda claims she didn't help plan the party. That's bizarre, because... I don't remember exactly, but... I think, it was Louise, who was meant to contact you. I heard that she'd... got in touch with you, but you'd said you were too busy. This was... back when you were in the media a lot. Because she... I never spoke to her. But, I don't think you... Maybe that's the case. - I can't speak for Louise. - No. Henrik agreed to come here, at first. And then he backed out. - Why do you think that was? - I couldn't say... Henrik is... He came by my workplace and he's like. "Hey there, you big pussy!" - What? - Yeah! That was his opener. And I felt, "No. No way... " - She was cute! - She was a wreck. - A little weird, but cute. Funny. - Cute? Don't know about that... Which one is me? Him, Niklas. - That one. - OK. ...when we convinced her I was in love with her? - You did that? - And I can do it again. Did that really happen? Did... Did someone really trick you into believing they were in love with you? Yes, several times, all the way through school. Really? - Did I do that too? - Yes, you were also involved. That's... That's tragic. It really is... I just don't get it. - Hi, this is Anna... - Hi, Anna, it's Christopher. - Hi there! - Is this a bad time? - No, not at all. - OK, good. Listen, I felt we didn't quite finish our last conversation. So I was wondering if we could finish it over a cup of coffee? Sure, of course... - Hi. - Hi. I'm really happy you agreed to come, because I felt after our last meeting... I felt really bad the day after. It came as a shock to me, that you saw me like that. I respect that... even if I don't recognise myself in what you say. At first, I felt a little sorry for you. But then, to be honest, I got really quite mad, because I really don't see myself as a bully or anything. Neither do I. What I mean is... You said I was one of the worst. Yes, but objectively, you were no worse than anyone else. It's just that, like I said, you did nothing and totally ignored me. And with the status you had for all those nine years, at the top of the hierarchy, it hurt that you never looked or... I thought it was really nice to meet you last time. We spoke as adults... You say I was the worst, yet I didn't do anything. - It doesn't add up. - No... And, above all, if this film is to be shown in public... I was brought up to be nice. That was important in my family. So it distresses me that you see me... as that sort of person. I'm an entirely different person today to who I was then. I think it would be a pity... if I was made out to be a bully. - Hello, this is Linus... - Hello! - My name's Anna. Is your mummy home? - No. - Do you know when she'll be back? - No. Do you know if she's coming home tonight or tomorrow? Can you talk to her, Mummy? I don't want to any more. - Hello? - Hi there, it's Anna. Hi, Anna! I was just wondering if the time we'd penciled in still works for you. I can't say right off, my diary's at work. Can I get back to you? - OK... - Great! Bye! Oh, dear... Why doesn't she just say no? Well, like I said, it's about finding the time. Mondays are possible, they might work... Thursdays, too, possibly, if I can find an opening. But... but... In that case, what time works for you? I'll check my diary, and get back to you. Louise? Louise? Hi. - Hi! What are you doing here? - I know it seems strange... Excuse me, Anna, let me just round off here. OK, I'll run a check and get back to you on Tuesday. - OK, that sounds good. Thanks. - Bye. - Louise, can I just have a quick word? - Anna... - I don't have time, Anna. I'm working. - I understand... I understand if you think it's strange me approaching you like this, but... Yes, I think it's pretty strange. Weird. I just find it odd that you don't want to see me. If you'd invited me to the reunion... I did! Really, I did! So, why won't you see me if I... I'm sorry, but this is ridiculous. It's childish. What are we, back in the sandpit? But Linda told me, when she and Sanna visited me, that at the reunion, people were asking, "Where's Anna?" You said, "I talked to her, but she said she couldn't come, "she was too busy with her last project. " I never... I never said that! I'm really sorry it feels wrong for me to... It stresses me out, meeting you like this. I'd rather sit and talk in peace and quiet. - I understand... - I... But isn't it odd that people say that you spoke to me? - Yes, but... - That you said I said I couldn't come? Yes, but I can't help what other people say, can I? Do you want to know the truth of it? It was like this. Andreas and Linda arranged the reunion, not me. Then they asked me if I could help. So, I helped. I helped by tracking down people, and sending out invites. So, I sent everyone invites. - Daniel, Pia... - But I didn't get one. But I can't help that! You come here accusing me because... Of course I invited everyone to a reunion! Everybody I've met so far, more than half of us say they saw you as a kind of leader. Although that doesn't mean you saw yourself like that. People have very different memories of the roles we had at school. That's what I'm interested in, and why I want to meet you. You're important precisely because others saw you as having high status. But, the thing is... Sure, but I already know what you think of me, Anna. - What do you mean? - It's no secret that you despised me. - Don't give me that look, please. - But... Despised? That's not true. But you'd never even say hello to me! If I didn't, it was for one reason. And that was because I felt completely worthless. So if I didn't greet you, it was only because I didn't dare to. Because I felt... like a nobody. You could all acknowledge that I was worthy of a life. So why didn't you, any of you, say hello to me? It's terrible that it was, like that for you. It's awful, Anna, and I'm really sorry about that. But... So why can't we just talk? What the hell. Call me tomorrow, and let's try to arrange something. But, will you pick up when I call? - Of course. So, that's sorted. Bye. - OK. Bye. - Isn't that him? Is it him? - Looks like it. Henrik. Henrik! - Hi. - Hi. - How's life? - Good. You? Well, it's Friday, nearly the weekend. It is the weekend. - So, how's the film going? - It's going really well. Good. - Do you have time for a quick chat? - No, actually, I don't. I'm due for dinner, and I'm running late as it is. I think it sucks that you can't take a minute or two to have a chat. I understand... I've realised that... - Hi... Rikard. - Henrik. I've decided that, I don't want to. OK... I really would've liked to hear your side of things. But since you don't have much time, let me just say that... I remember you as the hardest, worst, cruelest of them all during my entire... As I recall, we hardly ever said a word to each other. Even if we didn't speak to each other, you always gave me a hard time. I don't know if you remember how you often were like. "Anna, if I looked like you, I'd kill myself. "Can't you go home and oblige? That'd make my day. " Maybe I said that, but hey, I was a dumb teenager. I just think it's sad that we were at school for nine years, and you've no time to talk. As I wrote in my mail, I don't know you. I never have. I thought you were a weirdo, and couldn't figure you out. I found you unpleasant, quiet. And then, suddenly, there you'd be. - I thought you were... I didn't get you. - OK. You're no different to anybody else. Hi! - All well? - Awesome. It's Friday. - Early weekend, all day. - I can see that. See you. It's just like if any stranger came and asked me if I wanted to chat for an hour. I wouldn't do it simply out of politeness, now. Would I? It's not quite the same thing. We were actually at school together for nine years. OK, if any strange kid from our school asked me to chat for half an hour. - I wouldn't do it. - What about the reunion? You didn't... So why did you go? To meet my friends, and talk to them. But you weren't friends with everyone. No, not everyone, but I no doubt said hi to the ones I wasn't. And then I went and talked to my mates. I hung out with them, asked them about the past ten years. - You don't want to meet new people? - I told you. I said hi to them. But I'm interested in the ones I was interested in then. I realised I'm not at all curious about the ones I didn't care about then, or now. - What if your daughter was bullied? - To start with, she wouldn't... I don't think she could get bullied. She's too strong, and wouldn't allow it. If she was, she'd give as good as she got, or would just play with someone else. I just want to tell you that I talked to many of our other classmates. And they said they felt that... you haven't matured that much. Maybe. That's for them to say. - But how do you feel? - I don't care. Well, anyway, now you've had your little chat. But... Rikard here, he's in the film. - Hi. - Hi. He plays Micke. - Well, I have to... Bye, then. - Bye. Bye. Shit, see that guy over there in the grey coat? - Excuse me... but you're an actor, right? - Yes... Weren't you in Anna Odell's class reunion film? - That's right. - You played me in it! - No! - Yeah. - Wow. - Can I sit down? - How weird. - I'll be damned. I was at Anna Odell's a few days ago to see the film and have a chat. But you must've tried to form some impression of me? Anna told me what she thought about you, showed me photos and stuff. So, I have formed some sort of impression. - But how did you... Thanks. - There's Facebook, you know. - So I just went into Facebook. - You checked me out on Facebook? You didn't go in to steal my identity, did you? Or like, copy it, somehow... and documentarily try to create... as accurate a picture of me as possible? You haven't done that? I hear you, but I think I've formed my own idea of things. - It doesn't feel special to you? - Not in this case, no. It's not as if you were playing someone who doesn't exist. Like, for example, Darth Vader in Star Wars, or... or Aragorn in The Lord of the Rings. You're playing a real person. That must count for something special? Except it's my own interpretation of this person. Although the real person is sitting here. It's as if Aragorn was sitting here. - Well, no... - It is. Though, I understand... I'm caught up in your impression, whether you or I like it or not. - True, true. - It was exciting to meet you. It's not every day you meet an actor who plays yourself. It's not every day you meet your role in person either. - I'll go back to my mates. Take it easy! - You too. Let X=X You know... I could write a book, and this book, would be think enough... to stun an ox Cause I can see the future, and it's a place... about 70 miles east of here, where it's lighter Linger on over here Got the time?
