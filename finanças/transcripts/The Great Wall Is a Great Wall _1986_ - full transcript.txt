(lion roars, snarls) (chatter) (chatter) (chatter) (chatter, water splashing) (man coughs) (chatter) (bell rings) (laughing) (patter of balls hitting paddles) (funky pop rock music) (electropop music) (electropop music continues) (shrill screeching) (music fades) (loud clattering) (kissy noises) (bird chitters) "My dearest niece." "It’s have been a long time..." (chuckles) (soft pop music plays) (boat horn blows) (indistinct chatter) ...tenth decimal. Oh, that’s it! Damnit! I’ve been trying to debug that program for the whole week. My God! I don’t know about your guy, but my guy should be a nice-looking Chinese guy who is perfectly circumcised. -Perfectly? -Perfectly. (laughing) (running footsteps) (heels clicking) Thank you, dear. (slurping) Mm. (sighs) What do you have to say about your report card, son? Nothing. Professor Chuang just called. He said you only showed up for his Chinese 1 class once. Ha. I have been going to Chinese class ever since I can remember. You know what? I never got to watch Bugs Bunny. Son, nobody should deny his own cultural background. Although we sent you to Chinese school every year, but you still don’t speak Chinese! (chatter) (soft patting) (muffled music plays) (water trickling) (makes honk noise) (sighs) Ahh. (laughing) (clears throat) (sings in Italian) (laughing) (continues singing) (panting) We’ve been preparing for a trip to Peking for the last five years. He has a standing invitation from his sister in Peking. And the China Computer Society. I even took him seriously once and took a class in Chinese. I thought you spoke Chinese. Can’t you tell? I’m an American. Right. No, I don’t know about our President Wilson. He’s so indecisive. Ah. I mean, it’s only natural. After all, you’ve been in charge of that PC Division for the past four years now. I only did the technical part of the project. You have done all this administrative work, haven’t ya? Well, somebody must mop the floor. Not that I enjoy it. I was told to do it. Hey, Jimmy! How are you doing? Hey, Leo. Congratulations, I heard the word about you becoming the new director of the PC Division. -Thank you. -You really deserve it. But it hasn’t been official yet. Today, we are going to have new lesson. Listen to me carefully. (laughing) "My hometown is a beautiful place. It stands beside a wide river at the foot of low green hills. It has many fine buildings and very wide streets. There are trees and flowers everywhere." "But it has not always been like that." "In the old days, it was a sad, dirty little town." (giggling) Do you understand that? (laughing) River. River. (bell ringing) (chatter) (inaudible whispering) (coin jangles on ground) (clap) (giggling) Ni hao. (insects chirring) Well, Jim here’s already discussed our income for the year. Keep it up, gentlemen, and Frances. Ah. Our PC computer, Comprecot, has been very competitive thanks to Leo, Neil, and their fellow workers. It therefore should come as no surprise that we’ve decided to establish a new PC Division. (screen retractor whirring) The new director of this PC Division is... Mr. Neil Mahoney. (indistinct whispering) And Comprecot’s inventor, Leo Fang, has been promoted to headquarters as senior member of the technical staff to our senior vice president. (telephone ringing) Five years ago, you told me I didn’t have enough experience to be the director. Now, Neil Mahoney has less experience than I had five years ago! There are other considerations. -Like what? -Well, such as youth. Neil is younger than you. Oh, you’re telling me I’m too old for this job. No, I don’t mean that at all. Now look, Neil has lots of good qualities. Now, listen to me, Leo! Neil. Neil doesn’t know the system well. He’ll learn! He’ll learn. Look, you have a real good job, very high up in the company. Hardly any hassle. Let me tell you what I think you’re thinking. Let me tell you. You don’t believe the Chinaman is good enough to be the director, that’s what you’re thinking. (soft music) (door slams) (telephone ringing) (dramatic music) (beeping) (forcefully sniffs) Forty years. (coffee pouring) (gasps) Damn. (music continues) (softly blows) (beeping) Mr. Wilson? Wilson! (dramatic musical chord) (operatic singing) (soft piano music) (singing continues) (singing continues) (insects chirring) If you want to study English well, you must study hard. (sips) That means memorizing the dictionary. (sips) When I was young, I used to memorize 50 words a day. (urinating) (grunts) (giggling) (moaning) Let’s get married. -Come on. -Now. Your father might come home early. He pretends he’s in China now. Paul, are you really going to China this summer? Actually, I don’t think we’re ever really gonna get there. Hm. You know what? What? I don’t think he really wants to go. Why not? Because... reality often produces disappointments. Funny old man. Hey, everybody! I have an announcement to make. I got tickets for our vacation. One month or even longer! -How’s that? -Pop! -For real? -You bet. (laughing) What--you-- we’re all going? We all go. We deserve it. You deserve it, I deserve it. We finally deserve it. Oh my-- You mean like all four of us? (laughing) Oh. (patter of balls hitting paddles) (sneakers squeaking) (soft music) Bay, B-A-Y. (giggling) "Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. We here highly resolve that this nation, under God, shall have not... shall have a new birth of freedom... and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth." (giggling, clapping) (chuckling) (tender music) Um, I’m leaving. -Hi. -Hi. I’m leaving. Hi, Mr. Fang. Have a pleasant trip. Bye, Linda. (groans) (football game plays on TV) What’s wrong, Romeo? Father. (TV chatter continues) Gimme a break. (sighs) Who’s playing? 49ers against Broncos. Hey, I thought you stopped seeing Linda. I will. When I’m in China. What ever happened to that nice Chinese girl, Margaret Wei? She’s going out with some white guy. (TV chatter continues) You know... Why don’t you like Linda as my friend? You know, the only reason why you don’t like her is ’cause she’s not Chinese. Come on, I never suggested anything like that. It’s true. All Chinese parents are racists. What are you talking about? Hey! You use the tradition and the culture to cover up the racism. Really! Why do we have to do everything the Chinese way anyway? It gets you nowhere. This is America, ya know? You’ve lived here for so long and you still talk with an accent. What’s wrong with my accent? I think it’s rather cute. What’s the weight limit on each suitcase again? (grunts) -44 pounds. -Yes, yes! Sack him! Sack him! Sack him--oh. Here’s an interesting paragraph about the city of Peking. Listen. "Peking is a city--" Peking is a city surrounded by walls. Big, thick walls. What? Why? To keep the invaders out or to confine the natives in. It is just as difficult to leave the city as to go back. What does your sister say in the letter? Oh...they still didn’t do anything about father’s grave. -Oh no. -(gong rings) (mellow electronic music) (traffic passing) Where’s the wall? "The Great Wall is located 60 miles northwest of the city." I don’t mean that wall. "The wall of Peking City was torn down right after liberation for the purpose of expanding the nation’s capital." Gee, what do you know? China expert, huh? The guidebook doesn’t lie all the time. Those damn high-rises. (music continues) (engine buzzing) (music continues) Leo told me all about you. Hey, Lili. (baby crying) Sorry. (murmur of chatter) (soft music) (birdsong) (insects chirring) (indistinct chatter) He’s asking about your cooking, your Chinese cooking. Oh! I only know how to cook beef noodles. What do you do for fun at school? Huh? Um...for fun? (giggling) We don’t play. We...study. Do you play sports? -Sports? -Sports. I play ping-pong. Oh, no kidding? That’s great. That’s great! That used to be my sport. They want us to move in. Well prepared. Leo, do you think they like me? Sure. They’re crazy about you, believe me. I feel like I’ve known them for a long time. Of course. You all belonged to the same herd of cattle in your previous lives. Dad? Hm? They don’t have a shower bath here. Too bad. Are you warm enough, Paul? Are you kidding? I’m hot. (insects chirring) They have squat toilets. Yeah. I don’t think I’ve quite developed the leg muscles for them. You need practice. Oh, shut up. Go to sleep, will ya? (click) (crackling) (commotion) (insects chirring) (sighs) (thunder rumbling) (gong rings) (mellow music) (tender music) (solemn music) Sonny? Come here. Here’s the old man I told you about. He’s funnier than you and I put together. Funny man. (birds chittering) (solemn music) (rumble of engines) (upbeat pop music) (laughs) (music continues) (overlapping chatter) (laughter) (grunts) (birds chirping) (flatulence) I can’t believe this. Look at this. She reads all your mail! Well, haven’t you ever heard of a thing called privacy? Privacy? -Privacy. -Privacy. (laughs) Yeah, all right. I guess there’s no such a thing in China. (patter of balls hitting paddles) (inaudible) Thanks. (indistinct conversation) (patter of balls hitting paddles) Thank you. (upbeat funky music) -Paul? -Hm? (giggling) Oh, hey, hey, hey, look at this. What do you think? "Put the... Put the Great Wall On Your Chest." (laughing) Hey? Look. This is just what Linda needs. Hey, I’ll buy it. (indistinct chatter, playful banter) He’s running, he’s zigzagging, he’s slipping through! What! It’s a touchdown! Oh my God! (birds cawing) The Great Wall was built thousands of years ago to prevent invaders from the north. Didn’t work. Nope. The invaders are from the south. (soft music) (wind blowing) (cicadas chirring) (leaves rustling) (cicadas chirring) (shoes clicking on tile) (indistinct conversation) (door squeaks) (equipment whirring) (keys clacking) (shrill whir of printer) Crazy. Ah-ha! This character is wrong. No, this only simplified version. (chuckling) (insects chirring) (laughing) He speaks Chinese all the time with his relatives and his Chinese friends in the States. He earns $0 now. (laughter) That was a cup of hot coffee. Very hot. Leo! What are you talking about? Never mind. (chuckles) Oh, Chinese fabrics are so beautiful. It’s too bad they don’t pay more attention to fashion design. Oh, it’s too short. Too short. Don’t you think it’s too long? Long? Too long? (she laughs) I don’t think I could fit into this. Gee, I’m too old for a maternity dress! Oh, you’re gonna sew it. (tender music) (snipping) (rapid clicking) Oh, it’s too big! I haven’t been this big since I had Paul! Look at me. I look pregnant. Oh, gee. It’s too--look at it! (tender music) Oh, there. Look. Look! (giggling) No, no, no, no! Oh, you look lovely. Wrinkles? No, you don’t have any wrinkles. Oh, when you were young. Oh, you had a lot of guys. Well, he’s a little overweight. (imitates loud sipping) Weekends, he watches TV all weekend. Watch football, football. Go, go, go! (tongue click) (snores) -Oh, Leo does the same thing! -Mama! (mellow music) Who’s Linda? Oh, she’s just one of Paul’s friends. Paul has many friends. He’s very popular. (cicadas chirring) (music continues) (pop music) (heels clicking) (giggling) (chuckling) (cicadas chirring) Hey, Mom! Here she is! (sings playfully) (laughing) (indistinct conversation) (cicadas chirring) (soft music plays) (murmur of crowd chatter) (soft music plays) (music quickens) (upbeat music) (clapping) (soft pop music) (tender music) (soft squeak) (insects chirring) (door slams) (soft erhu music) (murmur of crowd chatter) (inaudible conversation) (bell dings) (rumble of bus engine) (murmur of crowd chatter) (rumble of engine) (traditional music and singing) (giggles) -Listen, Dad. -Huh? (indistinct whispering) Running out again? (indistinct mumbling) What a guy! -Too much, Dad. -Hey, hey, hey, hey. (Leo chuckles) Sexually very active. (bell dings) (burps, groans) Gee. (indistinct, drunken singing) (laughing) (giggling) (dramatic drum music) (lively traditional music) (music continues) (upbeat pop music) (cicadas chirring) (handheld game beeping) Ooh, yeah. (beep, exclamation) Fourth down, 15 to go. You’re dead. -You want bet? -Yeah. -(beeping) -Hey, touchdown! -Lili. -Beginner’s luck. Lili! -Broken there? -Huh? Oh, this? No, you know, this, uh... this is the style, you know? It’s, uh, fashion. This is the best, really. Pierre Cardin, I’m not kidding you. (chuckling) (sighs) No. You know, you don’t understand. You know, these, uh... you know, these here, these are Calvin Kleins. (lively guitar music) Go Go, Johnny, go, go Go, Johnny, go, go Johnny B. Goode (birds chirping) (groaning) (patter of balls hitting paddles) How’s your ping-pong? My coach says I’m gonna be the best one in the bunch if I could just get my serve down. You know, that, um... that singles title coming up? No problem, man, I’m gonna take it. Wow, you gonna play against Liu? Lili, didn’t your boyfriend Liu win the title last year? All right, this is gonna be hot. Is it a major match? I don’t know. It’s major for me. Look at those two guys checking you out. Look at this, they’re really checking you out. Why is a nice Chinese girl like you hanging around with foreign devils like us? Mom! Your favorite niece is in a funny mood. Again. Stop teasing her. Give her some privacy. Oh, come on, I’m cool. When are we gonna eat? Ready to move back to the hotel tonight? Huh? Not really. I’m kinda getting used to this place. Developing my leg muscles. We’re moving back to the hotel. Your father told me this morning. Why? Just because of Lili? There is one thing in this country that causes more concern than the Super Bowl game back home. No kidding. The annual college entrance examination. I know, I know. It’s like a 1 in 100 chance and, um, if you don’t make it, then you have to sell tea in the streets. Well...I think Lili would make a beautiful tea peddler. Go inside and pack! Okay! (soft music) (soft dramatic music) (birds chirping) (indistinct conversation) (patter of balls hitting paddles) (music fades, ends) (indistinct whining) (siren wailing) (birds chirping) (murmur of crowd chatter) (bell ringing) (soft dramatic music) (sweepers whirring) (hammering) (murmur of crowd chatter) (insects chirring) (lively music and singing) (radio clicks off) So what? (patter of balls hitting paddles) (grunts) (indistinct conversation) (patter of balls hitting paddles) (murmur of crowd chatter) Next will be the final for the men’s singles. The competitors are Paul Fang, a Chinese American player, and champion of the Youth Ping-Pong Tournament and from Southwest California, USA. (whistling, applause) (tense, dramatic music) (tense upbeat music) (applause) (applause) (music continues) (applause) (applause) (music continues) (applause) (music continues) (applause) (patter of ball hitting paddles) (applause) (patter of balls hitting paddles) (murmur of crowd) (cheering, applause) (cheering, applause) The kid is killing it. Yeah. (cheering, applause) (patter of ball hitting paddles) (applause, whistling) (crowd quiets) (tense music) (music intensifies) (cheering, applause) (applause, cheering) (patter of ball hitting paddles) (applause) (patter of ball hitting paddles) (applause) (slow, echoing taps) (crowd roars with applause, cheering) (shower water trickling) How do you feel, dick breath? Oh, great. Super great. (sighs) You had a tough match today, didn’t you? You know, I play to win. I hate losing. I hate it so much. Listen, Sonny, see, you played the best game ever. Well, you didn’t win the championship, but you know, you gave the best performance and gave it the best shot, and that’s a victory by itself. Can’t you understand that? You see, in each tournament, there’s only one champ but there are many, many winners. I think today you’re one of them winners. And the ping-pong game you should look at this way: it’s not a game-- Hey, Dad? I’m kinda hungry, you know? So, uh...why don’t you save your bullshit? Okay. Okay. Let me treat you to one of those, uh, grand Peking duck feasts with warm Coca-Cola. Warm Coca-Cola. Okay. You know, if you want to say it right, you gotta say "penis breath." -Yeah? -It’s penis breath. How about, uh... turkey tits? (laughing) That’s kinda old. Yeah, I assume so. (soft music) Hi, Grace. Mr. Wilson. What a surprise. My, you look lovely. Oh, thank you. It’s a Chinese peasant blouse. -Elegant, elegant. -Do come in. How was your trip to China? Oh, it was wonderful. Oh, boy, you were gone for how long-- People in America think I’m too Chinese and then people in China think I’m too American. What do you have to say about that? (speaks poorly in Chinese) Bossman. No, not exactly. (speaks in Chinese) (giggles) (birds chirping) The Chinese doctor stuck needles in my back and there was this funny tingling sensation, but it works. Works like a charm. Magic, magic. Looking good, Leo! (birds chirping) (grunt, flatulence) (sighs) (rhythmic cymbal tapping and drumming) (indistinct whispering) (giggling) (whistles) (applause) (cymbal tapping and drumming continues) (chatter, commotion) (lively traditional music) (indistinct chatter) (soft traditional music and singing) Quarterback, get up! Game time. (music and singing continue) (soft drumming) (lively drum music) (singing and music continue) (music and singing continue) (music and singing continue) (singing and music continue) (singing ends) (music ends) (lion roars, snarls)
