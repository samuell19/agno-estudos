AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] AUDIENCE: [WHISTLING AND CHEERING] [GASPS] No vacancies. [INAUDIBLE] Lord Gallifet! Who's that? Oh! Honored, honored. The play is a classical story, but it happens to feature one of Pearse's spiciest young tarts. - [LAUGH] Yes, we like a, uh-- - Classical. -- story. As I was saying, one of Europe's most charming, erotic young actresses. Oh, excellent. Is a refugee. Hot, hot, off the boat from Mexico. Mexico! Oh yes, of course. Recently General Gallifet brought new honor to his country. Yes, quite. So is this "war zone" strong enough to take the weight of your young-- Fawn? This is very sturdy. She likes to straddle it. Yes, it's a creation of technical genius. It is not for nothing they call my theater the most highly mechanized brothel in Europe. [LAUGH] Such modesty in describing your art. Oh, thank you. And um, so how does this contraption-- Work? Yes, well, you pull the lever, et voila! Would you like a demonstration? Oh, yes. Go get O'Brien. So who's he? He's the master of this technical illusion. As a matter of fact, he happens to be, as my good self, one of your loyal British subjects. Go get O'Brien, do as you're told. Does your highness speak French at all? Ah, no. Yes, horrible language. Oh please, please, yes. A gift. I don't think so. But we'll be back to see your show. Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey-- shut up and sod off, you're spoiling the [INAUDIBLE] the village rabble. How dare you call my brothel a theater you syphilitic bastard! Ban that man from the live performance. Look, when he arrives, get in there and give them a bit of culture before the rubbish starts. [INAUDIBLE] the music! Go on, get on with it. [MUSIC STARTS AND CROWD CHATTERING] MAN: [SPEAKING FRENCH] WOMAN: [SPEAKING FRENCH] [CHEERING] ROMBARDE: Whoever you are, [INAUDIBLE] Come back here, you [INAUDIBLE] ANNOUNCER: [SPEAKING FRENCH] [APPLAUSE] AUDIENCE: [WHISTLING AND CHEERING] Why on Earth we have to sit through this dross first, I've no idea. All right, William. Now, after the real show, there's to be a champagne supper for, um-- Oh, good Lord. WILLIAM: Make sure that La Belle Mexican gets this, would you? AUDIENCE: [JEERING AND YELLING] AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] Complete secrecy, do you understand? Absolute secrecy. [SPEAKING FRENCH] AUDIENCE: [LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE] [SINGING IN FRENCH] AUDIENCE: [WHISTLING AND CHEERING] AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] Done. By Jove, Grafton, you've no idea-- [LAUGH] You really must be careful. All right, all right. The queen will not be amused. She might not be amused, but by Jove, I am. How much longer, do you think? GRAFTON: No idea. We have mutual friends and a mutual cause. You've been hanging around for days. What do you want? I'm Cluseret. General Cluseret, commander in chief of the Irish Feinian. Cluseret? Prove it. A personal gift from Samuel Cope himself, what more proof do you want? We'll talk later, let me work. My God, look. I could shoot the future English king from here. You can't shoot him now, she might fall off. Come on, what's one tart for more or less in this poxy whorehouse? Hey, hey! How dare you call my theater a brothel, fuck off. I am the only one who's allowed to cast aspersions on my empire. Cafe Anglais. Come and see what theater can do. I'll tell you when. [SINGING IN FRENCH] AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] [WHISTLES] Look at that, Grafton, look! My dear Grafton, no one will find us here amidst the splendors of ancient Greece. It is incumbent upon me to remind your Royal Highness that Her Majesty will not tolerate another scandal! Just sit on the swan and shut up! Damn. Now Grafton, don't move! [YELLING] [LAUGHING] Vive la Mexico! La Belle Mexican! Good evening. I've really no idea. I was sent. Oh, don't be absurd. It's a stupid play about a whore. How can you know? And what would you call this place? My dear, good man, there is a natural order to things, and that will never change. I got that one from my mama, and I got that one from my mama. And my mama gave me that one. And guess who gave me that one? My mama. [LAUGH] And who gave you-- [LAUGH] round. One step, two step, tickle you under there. Now tell me, how do I get out of here? [YELLING] KARL MARX: Men make their own history. But they do not make it just as they please. They do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given and transmitted from the past. The tradition of all the dead generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living. All facts and personages of great importance in the world history occur, as it were, twice. The first time, as tragedy. The second, as farce. [INAUDIBLE] CAFE SINGER: [SINGING IN FRENCH] CROWD: [APPLAUSE] Bonsoir. Perhaps some of you are surprised by the secrecy surrounding this gathering. Behind this curtain, there is a painting which has been decreed illegal. For reasons of security, it will be on display for no longer than 10 minutes. Who is that pompous idiot? CLUSERET: Before-- A man who wants to do business with me. CLUSERET: I wish to point out-- He's a Frenchman who's fought for liberty all over the world. With Garibaldi in Italy, against slavery in the American Civil War. Lincoln even made him a general. Now, he fights for Ireland. CLUSERET: Ladies and gentlemen, a coincidence, and a very happy one. We are pleased to welcome him here tonight, La Belle Mexican. [APPLAUSE] No more Mexican than I am. Shh. Only you know the truth. CLUSERET: Madams et monsieurs, the moment of truth for Napoleon's pathetic puppet-- [SPEAKING FRENCH], prophecy of things to come, closer to home. [CLAP] CROWD: [GASPS] Why did you bring me here? I don't want to get into trouble. If there's any trouble, I'll take care of you. But you should know what's going on in the world. CLUSERET: And now-- CLUSERET: -- we have a soldier-- who, having witnessed-- CLUSERET: -- The atrocities in Mexico refuses to speak his mother tongue. I'll tell you what they did in Mexico. We took no prisoners. We killed and killed and killed and killed and killed and killed! I have nightmares every night. Mademoiselle, this is about to become a scandal worth avoiding. Mon dieu, I do know you. You were with the prince. Come with me, please. She'll leave with me. CLUSERET: Things come in all societies when it's free. Who now in France can think, speak, act, write string quartets without this say so, without the permission of the Emperor? [SPEAKING FRENCH] It is a crime. It is a shameful crime! Thank you very much for being so intelligent and patient. We're now coming to the conclusion of our little soiree. [SPEAKING FRENCH] I wish merely to add that [INAUDIBLE]-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] -- decreeing joy for the people, there is nothing in the world like an Emperor. AUDIENCE: [CHEERING AND SHOUTING] [HORN HONKS] All right, listen here, you bunch of cunts. Can I bring to your attention a genuine, a perfect bargain. A beautiful theater situated in a prime site, performing the possibility for total redevelopment or complete demolition. Either ways, a fucking good bargain at six million francs. Yeah, well, it's a job lot, so you can take it or leave it, you stupid bastards - [LAUGHTER] I haven't got all day to talk tittle tattle with you blockheads. I'm off to run a successful theater. And by the way, pudding chops, I have and never will be bankrupt in my life. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Ramborde wants to have the street singer arrested. No, I don't think Severine's got anything to do with it. I was surprised to get your invitation after so long. Oh, there's been a change in my duties. But anyway, tonight's dinner is purely for pleasure. It depends where you were planning to go. Oh, I should have thought the answer was obvious. I don't think there's anything obvious about you, Monsieur Grafton. O'BRIEN: Aren't you taking a big risk, coming here where you're so well known? I'm now an American citizen. If I'm caught, all they can do is to deport me. What had this stuff got to do with the Irish cause? In the Irish cause it is not Ireland alone that I see, but all humankind. We're not ready for your world revolution, Monsieur Cluseret. We're still struggling to become a nation. Beware of nationalism, it speaks to our hearts but it turns governments to greedy killers. You forget our struggle is an ancient one. I am fighting for the ghosts of my ancestors, for the land that was stolen from them. I forget nothing, and nor should you. There is a deep tradition of sympathy for the Irish cause in revolutionary France. Slainte. [SPEAKING GAELIC] Is it not permissible for you to follow in your prince's footsteps? You're being indiscreet, my little swan. It's not totally an unpleasant memory. Ah. So you like to watch me on the stage. But, which do you prefer, to watch or to get closer, Monsieur Grafton? Depends on whether one's offered the choice, and by whom. CLUSERET: Did you know that the Englishman Milord is back in town, the prince's procurer? What of it? My contacts tell me he's after your actress friend. What's one more foppish aristo among so many? Today, Grafton, tomorrow, the Prince Imperial. And then? Grafton is just a fop on the outside. My contacts tell me that he's a senior British agent. You must say nothing to your actress. She cannot be trusted. GRAFTON: An introduction to the Emperor is possible. [SPEAKING FRENCH] He has commented appreciatively on your-- acting. Only his hand? What if he should asked to see you privately? Then I would repay the honor with a kiss on his cheeks. I happen to know some curious facts about the Emperor's amours. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Each new woman is undressed in an anteroom, and she's taken, naked, into the room where the Emperor, also naked, is waiting for her. But, she's informed before entering the room that she may kiss his majesty anywhere, except on his face. [SPEAKING FRENCH] AUDIENCE: [APPLAUSE] - [SPEAKING FRENCH] - On what? Well, I haven't expected to find you. Charming. France was just being tricked into a war, which she has no hope for winning. Where's Severine? The Emperor has been at the ministry of war ever since he left the theater. He sends his regrets. A reward? [SHOUT] Hey, hey, hey. See here, look, look. It's nice, isn't it? Look [INAUDIBLE], Berlin. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Don't stand there like a dog's dick, get it stuck on outside the theater. Come on, come on, come on, [TUTS] Careful, careful! I'm going to make a fortune out of this war. This time a new beast has been let loose; mechanized warfare. CROWD: [CHEERING] [CHANTING IN FRENCH] [SINGING IN FRENCH] AUDIENCE: [CHEERING] [CANNON EXPLOSION] AUDIENCE: [WHISTLING AND CHEERING] RAMBORDE: Defeat. Defeat! The best army in the world, defeated, oh god it's not possible. This war was supposed to make me rich. Your patriotic operas have filled this place and now you're paying the price. Oh go ahead, suit yourself. We've all been ruined by a [INAUDIBLE] generals, useless bastards. Now the abdication. I tell you, Paris will never be the same without the Emperor. Paris needs a republic. Oh, great man, great man, what did he say? Capital flow and flow, go forth, enrich yourself. I did. Now look what a bleeding state I'm in. [INAUDIBLE] How do you rate Mr. [INAUDIBLE] chances, my Lord? Oh, bless. The French are already suing for peace. Here are the documents. And if we're shot down? Do we burn them? No need, they're fully coded. Whatever happens, this one message must get through. If Prussia demands too much, there will be a revolution which could set Europe alight. I understand. I won't let you down. You nervous? My Lord, I'm shitting myself. Unwise in a confined space. It's time you were on board. [HUMMING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] On what? I have no opinion of it. [SHOUT] [LAUGH] We know we can trust you, A man who's watched his family starve in the famine is not going to betray the cause. Slainte. [SPEAKING GAELIC] I dreamt you were dead. I'm here. Starvation's doing strange thing to my head. I dreamt I was in the famine, that you were there. What is the most exotic dish you've had during this siege? Neck of giraffe. I wonder, if this idiocy should continue, shall we, like the rabble, be reduced to eating dogs and rats? I very much doubt that, Grafton. Ah. I'll join my guests. Ah, bonsoir, my dear. SEVERINE: Bonsoir. You have not disappointed me. I brought a guest. Be seated. Deprivation is never a universal condition. Champagne? We've come for the food. I have ordered roast swan. [SPEAKING FRENCH], you expect me to eat that? People are starving in the streets and you play this extravagant game. [SOLDIERS MARCHING AND BRASS BAND PLAYING] AUDIENCE: [SHOUTING] The government has fled Paris! [SPEAKING FRENCH] Central committee of the National Guard-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] -- is calling upon brothers and sisters-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] --to join us-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] --in forming communes-- [SPEAKING FRENCH] --in all the cities of France! [SPEAKING FRENCH] CROWD: [CHEERING] RAMBORDE: [BELCHES] [SINGING IN FRENCH] Revolution needs money. Where is all the money in this city? In the Bank of France, but our fools won't touch it. Call themselves revolutionaries and they won't pick a lock. I don't know what surprised me most, your invitation or my acceptance. Beauty and good sense. In harness at last, my dear, dear Severine. I knew you would come. I'm not here for the meal. Neither am I. Then a deal can be struck. Deal? Does it have to be business? [LAUGH] Where the hell do you think you're taking her? None of your damn business. I'm making it my business. I love her. But I can afford her. Not now. CLUSERET: There is more at stake than this private matter. Why the hell did you have to sell yourself again? And to that aristocratic bastard of all people. [CANNON EXPLOSION] [CANNON EXPLOSION] CROWD: [JEERING AND SHOUTING] [SPEAKING FRENCH] [DERISIVE LAUGHTER] CROWD: [MURMURING] [SHOUTING] No! CROWD: [JEERS AND SHOUTING] No! No! No! No! [SHOUTING] How long have you been here? Long enough. May I not come to see the result of my investment? Your investment has been repaid in a private room. The theater has nothing to do with you. You're wrong. All life has become a spectacle. I've just come from the start of an amusing and rather ridiculous play at the Hotel [INAUDIBLE]. Cluseret's trial? It interests you? Well. My guess is that citizen Cluseret will face a firing squad at dawn tomorrow. Perhaps they'll shoot his associates, too. You've already arranged that, you bastard. CROWD: [SHOUTING] CROWD: [MIXED CHEERING AND SHOUTING] CROWD: [MURMURS] [CHEERING] KARL MARX: History is built on tremendous forces of energy, which surge ceaseless for weak points in the social fabric through which it can burst. The commune, by not focusing the energy at its disposal, onto the point of battle, has forfeited the victory. So it is that the sweep of history is determined by the minutest detail. [GUNSHOT] Give me the gun, I've got to reach the theater before any more of these bastards get here. [GRUNT] [GUNSHOT] Come on. Work. The killer. The fucking killer! [INAUDIBLE] [SPEAKING GAELIC] CROWD: [SHOUTS] That bastard will do it, he will. This is my livelihood I'm talking about, especially Severine. Look, um. Couldn't you put the word in for her? You know, you know her. You all know her. They don't mean it, they're just a bunch of stupid fucking actors. They just get overexcited when they dress up. [PROTESTING SHOUTS] [SINGING IN FRENCH] [GUNSHOTS] This is where we must part. Where are we? Follow the catacombs through, then head for the coast. The way to the future lies through the past. Here, take this. What about you? Go. Go! [SPEAKING FRENCH] [GUNSHOTS] [GUNSHOTS] be [GUNSHOT] [GUNSHOT] [GASPS] Evening. Evening. [INAUDIBLE] O'Brien, is it? How very nice to see you. So you've discovered this place, too? I come here quite often. They're all here. All alive, including that vulgar little man who ran the theater. Me? My career goes from strength to strength. In fact I'm almost certain to be the next ambassador in Paris. Goodbye, O'Brien. Severine, you know her, don't you? She's waiting for me in the Cafe Anglais. I see her all the time. [GUNSHOT] GRAFTON: [CRIES OUT]
