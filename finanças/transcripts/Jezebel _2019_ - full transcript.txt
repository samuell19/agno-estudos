She writes it down. Okay... well... Someone's gotta watch Juju Dom? Hey. Look, you gotta watch Juju while we go see Mom today. Dominic! - Yo! Fine! - Thank you. Wow. Moving on in, huh Tiffany? Got your stuff all over the place. How's that floor feel? Snug as a bug. Mm. Dominic let me have the couch. No. You took the couch. Well, you can just have the couch while we go see Mom, okay?

Be good, girl. - Okay. And... - Hey. - Hey. Well, if you wear what you wore last time, I'm gonna be there like, 20 minutes early. - Dom... - Just so I can see you walk in. Dom. I gotta go to work. You gotta get off the phone. - I just got on it. - I don't care. I got to go to work. Dom... now. I got you. Give me a minute. Okay. It's loud in here. I'm tired. Did Juju eat? Uh. She fell asleep about 20 minutes ago, but I made this for her. So, when she gets up she can have it. - How's your mom? - I don't know, she um... She can't really talk to us 'cause they got her... She's got, like, this thing... Breathing machine. They put her on a respirator? Any more noodles? There's some more in the pan. Don't open a new pack, please. You can go have a nasty time on the phone now. It's not nasty, Dominic. Just... - Yes it is. - Just... Can you shut up? And I ain't gonna stay here to listen to it, man. I'm gonna go out. - Good. - I think I'm gonna go with him. Have fun guys. Have a lot of fun. No drinking outside of this house. No drinking, Dominic. Yeah. Finish it here. Hi. Hey, Daddy. Hello? Yes. What is it? Okay. Um... Thank you. I will. We got to get to the hospital right now. She's dead isn't she? You're right, Dom. Why didn't you call us? You guys weren't even here when we left this morning. And how were we supposed to call you? I don't even know why you guys were out so late anyways. You could have tried. Y'all probably left right before we got here. I think we had other things to think about Dominic. Like what? Who's gonna get her clothes? Dominic. What? You know that's all she left us. Hang on a sec. Hang on. We got something else we need to discuss here. Okay? Excuse me. Excuse me! Look, I'm sorry about your all's mama. Okay? I'm real sorry. All right? But she was sick a long time. Right? And now we've got some things that we need to discuss about the five of us all sleeping here. What is that? Give me that. No. And you know what. There's no use in lying about it, Sabrina. You know why? Because it hasn't been paid. Okay? You know how I know that? Because they don't stick these on people's doors who pay the rent. Well, maybe if you work some time, it would be paid. No! Serious. What do you do? You don't do anything. What do I do. What do you do? What do you do here except for make your brother sleep on the goddamn floor and prance around here like you own the place? You act like a princess, like you're better than everybody else. I'm just here to take care of Mom. You don't... Okay. So you say I don't do anything around here. Let me just clean this filthy place up. Would that make you happy? Look, I'm just saying we can't keep carrying you, Tiffany. Laundry! Look, I don't know. Why don't you figure out how to put some food in the fridge or something? Shit, that'd be more help than you... You know what? Consider this this week's rent. - With what money? - Dave. - Well, fuck you! - You know what... You didn't have to say all that to her. What did she say to me? You didn't have to say all that to her. - Sit down. - I'm sorry. You're right. She shouldn't say that shit either. It's bullshit. Sit down and be quiet. Hey. Thanks for doing those. Dave and Dom took off. So... Tiff... Tiff... Hey. Hey. Don't worry about what Dave said, okay? Tiff... I don't understand why you're even with him. What do you see in him? He doesn't do anything. He's a loser. No he isn't. He's not. Don't say that. Look, he's here... He takes care of Juju, okay? Well, you can let him know that I'm leaving after the funeral. You don't have to do that. Come on. Come on. Open up. You don't have to do that. I got something for you. Look. Right here. "Looking for Internet models. Nudity required. Great pay." What? It's a job. Okay? Look. Well, what do I have to do? It's easy. You don't have to talk like I do. Just... show off a little bit. It's not a big deal. You can make money, you can do what you want to do. Then I can stay here? You can do what you want. I got something for you. I've been saving this. Wow. That's for me? Yep. If you want it. Yeah. I've never had this type of hair before.

Um, hi. I'm here about the ad in the paper. - What's your name? - Tiffany. - What's your real name? - Tiffany. - How old are you Tiffany? - Nineteen. Let me see some ID. All right. Follow me. You got my check? You'll get your check after your shift tonight. So here's the deal. You get 15 dollars an hour, plus a dollar a minute for private shows. All right? We pay every two weeks. Okay? I need you to fill out these forms. I'm gonna need a copy of your ID. Vicky'll train you during your shift tonight. Important rules. No nudity in the free chat room. Not at all. You'll get fired for that. No sharing your personal information. No giving out your phone number. You'll get fired for that too. Plus it's just dangerous for everyone. Okay? Lastly, no penetration in the private chat rooms. Vicky's gonna show you some camera tricks tonight, but if you get caught doing any penetration, you're gonna catch a prostitution charge. This is live. This isn't video. All right? You got any questions? Um... wait, I start now? Sooner you start, the sooner you get paid. All right. Your normal shift's gonna be 10:00 at night to 6:00 in the morning. That's daytime Europe. You should do well there. - So, you ready? - Yeah. All right. Uh... Let me see your body. Um... Huh? - Do you want to work or not? - Yeah. All right. Lift up your bra. Pants. Okay, now turn. No scars. No tattoos. You can turn back around. You're gonna need to shave that. This isn't the 70s. - Hey, Chuck. - Hey. This is Tiffany. You'll be training her tonight. Okay. She's been here a long time. You're in good hands with her. You can pick up your check after your shift. Bye, Chuck. Come sit down next to me. I'll introduce you to all the guys. Okay. Hi everybody. This is Tiffany. Wait, wait. No. - Was that not your name? - No. No. It is my name. It's my real name. Oh. Yeah. You do not want to use that. Nobody here even knows my real name except Chuck. What do you want them to call you? Um... Jezebel. - Okay. Type it in. - Okay. Okay, good. So, normally all caps is considered yelling, but that's okay because you just started. And don't even worry about the keyboard. You'll be a pro in no time. I could be the president's secretary. That's how fast I type now. What? With those nails on? Oh, you'd be surprised what I can do with these nails. Mm-hmm. Hi, everybody. This is... Jezebel. Okay. So all the guys are on here to talk to you and they're gonna keep saying stuff like that to you. They're gonna say like, "Show me your tits", "Take your top off", and you're just gonna say, "Only in a private show." Only in a private show, because that's how you're gonna make your money. Now, you can get up, and you can turn around and show them your butt, but it can't be your naked butt because that would only be in a... - Private show. - Right. You got it. - Did you bring anything else to wear? - No. Because you either need to be in a bikini or a bra and panty set. - Okay, you ready? - Yeah. Okay. Come back and sit down. Now wave to the guys. Hey, Doug. Get a private... with my friend... Jezebel. It's her first night. And I know... you want to pop her cherry. Yeah Oh. Double trouble. Double fun. Those two girl shows are two bucks a minute. Easy breezy. You're gonna wanna bring your own sheets from now on just because some of the girls here don't really play by the rules, if you know what I mean, and you don't want to be rolling around in all that. Yeah. Okay. - Okay, so sheets, bikinis. - Right. - Oh, and what about those? - Oh, these? Yeah. You're gonna wanna get your own. But it doesn't really matter because nobody is actually using them. At least I'm not. That is so gross. Oh, my God. These girls... Jesus. Let me just wash this off. But, if they do want you to use one of these... Okay. - You're gonna want to spread your legs. - Oh You're gonna use this end first and you're gonna go... So you're just gonna move back and forth like that. Move your body around... and it's gonna look like it's actually going inside you. But it's not. And there's a huge delay, - so they won't even know. - Wow. And, if they're a really sick fuck, just put some of this on it... Oh, my God! And hold it up to the camera like it's all wet. Oh, okay. I mean, none of it's real, but it looks real. And that's really all that matters. - Okay. - And just make sure to do a lot of... You know what I mean? Really... Really sell it. Yeah. Sure, sure. There's no sound, so they can't actually hear what we're saying. So you could be calling them ugly fucks, and they'll have literally no idea. Oh! Ugly fuck! They'll never know. I know. It's like that. Okay. Okay. I think... I think I got it. Okay. Let's set up your show. Set up. You guys have fun. Keep him on for as long as possible, and see if he's gonna upgrade to two girl. - Okay. Thank you. - Yeah. No problem. Yes. And you are gonna pop my cherry. So? Where are you from? I have never... been to Gary, Indiana. Oh, yeah? Okay. Do you like them? Okay. So did you used to dance before? - No. - You're lucky. This is so much better. The guys can't touch you, and you don't have to see how gross they are in person. Yeah. Seems easy. Well, I didn't say it was easy. I said it was better. Most of the girls don't even last a month here. I've been here since we started. - We? - Yeah. Chuck's my brother. Family business. Oh. You feel good? Yeah. A little nervous. A little nervous but, I guess I'll learn. It's a job. So... Yeah, you don't have to look at anybody. No gross people. Yeah, and there's a lot of nice people there. This girl Vicky, she's really nice, so I'm making friends. Yeah, well I wouldn't trust her if I were you. You can't trust any of those girls, I don't care how nice they are. They're not your friends. No, they're not. The only thing you need... You got her doing that nasty stuff now too? Dominic, can you shut up and go back to sleep? I would if you two would shut up. Damn, it didn't take no time to convince you, huh? Little Miss Goody Two Shoes, not so innocent after all. Wow. Wonder what Mom would think of that shit. That's enough. My first night I got a private show. You couldn't even wait till she was buried in the ground. - Okay, let's go. Get up! - You've made me so proud. - Get up. Dominic! - Yo! What are you doin'? Do you have a job? - I've been applying to places. - I don't think so. Three a.m., drinking with Dave? I don't think so. We've been putting in applications at the casinos. - Yeah, right. - Exactly. - Okay. You want me go get a job? - Yes. Yes. Soon as Your Highness comes out of the bathroom. Hey. Little one, could you... Your Highness? Oh, Honorable One, could you please let me use the bathroom? Oh, and if you take a shit don't worry about it, we know your shit doesn't stink, so it's okay. Shut up, Dominic. Are you done primping and preening? Stop fighting. - When's Mom's funeral? - I don't know. - Who's taking care of it? - We are. I know what's being taken care of, and it ain't that. You need to go get one of those busboy jobs at one of the casinos. That's what you need to do. - I'll go with him. - Good. Did you hear me? Yeah, I heard you. I'm going. I'll go get a job. I'll go find a job. - I'll go with you, man. - No drinking. Who said anything about drinking? I just said I was gonna go fill out an application. Naw, that's all we do. All we do is drink. We just go out and drink. I'll go get a job. I'll go find one so I can be just like Tiffany. - Let's go, Dave. - Yep. Hey, do we have any money? What? We got to catch the bus to get some breakfast. Just... Please leave. Please leave, Dave. - That's a no? - Just go. Okay? Have to walk. No money for the bus. Shit. When is the funeral though? I don't know. We gotta sign some papers with the coroner saying we can't afford it. So... Who's gonna pay for it? The state will pay for it. Then what? Look, I get a... I get a check soon. I can give you money. No. You need your money. It's... It's just gonna take some time. That's it. We just gotta go through the process. So she's just gonna be there not being buried. I don't like it either. Okay. I have some stuff for you... that might work for... for your job. Just a couple of things in the closet that I have. The boys are gone so you can go check it out. - Okay. - It's like, in the closet, on the shelf. Behind those pillows up there. - The gold bag? - Yeah. Ooh. Sabrina, what is all this? Just a few things some of my little boy toys sent me. - They know where we live? - No, I have a P.O. box. You should get one too. - The bikini is nice. - Yeah. Try it on. - Doesn't fit me. - Okay. This is a pretty color. Okay. Wow. You look good. Do you like it? - Uh... - I see you hiding that body over there. Uh, yeah, um... just... it's different. I've never been really in a bikini before. So... So, you'll wear this... This is one of your options. And when you get paid, you can get a few more little items. Just so you keep switching it up. That's all that matters, you know, variety. - Yeah. - And you're gonna need to get some toys too. At least one. I don't need toys. They already have a bunch at Babe Net. It's okay. That's disgusting. That's gross. Why would you want to use their toys. No, it's not really gross. I mean, they don't even use it. You still need to get your own so, right up the street. You just go to the little adult store. Pick one out for you. - But, I don't have any money. - It's okay. I got you. Don't go telling anybody. Thank you. You can give it back to me when you get paid. Okay. Ugh. Sabrina, I'm so tired. Lay down. Here. Just, take a nap. - Okay. - Cool? - Thank you. - Okay. You're welcome. Woo! I'm back! - Oh, sorry. Ow. - Back already, huh? Yeah. He was a quick one. Don't worry, every minute counts. - Oh, this is Bianca. - Hi. - She won't be in here long. - Hi. Yeah, he should be logging on at any minute. She has this guy, he does 45 minute privates with her. Just with her laying flat down. Wow, that's it? Yup. Sometimes I fall asleep in there. There he is. Excuse me. Yeah, boys. Hi. - You wanna see her? - Yeah. It's so weird. What? Oh, my God. I think they liked that. - Go. Go! - Oh! Oh, Bobby. He's a fetish guy. Have you had one of those before? - No. - They like feet and stuff. We probably won't even have to get naked. Okay. This is my friend... Jezebel. Hi, Bobby. Watch this. Wanna see our toes? You are very polite. I knew you were bad. Mmm. Yes you do! I've been bad too. Spank me. Would you like that? Okay. Okay, look. So if you put it up to the camera. You don't actually have to do it. You just put it up and you hit. And it looks like, because of the delay, like you're actually hitting me. Right. Here, let's do it again. Well, don't hit it hard. Oh, my God! All right, girl. - Okay. - I'm sorry! I didn't know! Does he like it? Wait. Hold on. I have another idea. Do you wanna see us kiss? So, come here. Position your body like this. I'm gonna be just... Tilt your head a little bit, he can't tell if we're kissing or not. You can't laugh. He's gonna think we're laughing at him. - "I have to go back to work now." - No. Tell him he didn't ask. You didn't ask. - Oops. That was payback from before. - Oh. Wait! Okay, Bobby, come back soon. That was so easy! That was so easy. Yeah. Ow. Oh... Jezebel, may I please go back to work? No, Bobby. How dare you speak without being spoken to. Hello, Jezebel. You've been a bad, bad boy. I'll be... I'll be right out! - Ready? - Yeah. Where's David? He's not coming. He got a job. Starts today. - Oh. Where? - Stop being nosy. You know you don't want nobody to know where you work at. Okay you two. Not today. Let's go. Come on, Juju. Hey. Hello there. - Look at you. - You like it? I do. You look good. It kinda makes me want to write you a citation. Is that what you've been doing all day? Making sure nobody's hooking in the parking lot. How was the funeral? It was okay. It's over now. You working? Mm-mm. I need the day off. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Taking a night... for me. Maybe I'll call you up. - Oh, really? - Let you whisper in my ear. Mmm. Like you used to? Yeah. Tryin' to get a freebie? You gotta pay player. Two weeks until I get my check. I took the garbage out this morning. It's gotta be worth at least a minute. Want your free minute? Okay. I'll give you a minute. Hello. Hey, Vera. - Hey. - It's David. - Ah. Hey, Slave Dave. - Hey. What are you wearing? What am I wearing? Just a little nothing. I'm gonna need you to hike that little nothing up. Is that okay? Okay. I'll hike it up for you. - Will you do something for me? - Yeah. Tell me you want me inside you. I want you inside me. Want you to come dip in my chocolate. Beg me to dip in your chocolate. Please. Please dip in my chocolate. - Okay - Dip. Dip. You got it, Vera. Mmm. - Uh. What time is it? - Yeah, right. - That's a minute. - Stop. Why don't you go handle that in the bathroom? You're not serious, right? Yeah, I am. You can't finish that in here. You got to go to the bathroom. How long's this gonna go on for? As long as you're a horn-dog. There's people here. Come on. Come on. I thought you said your sister got a job. She did, but... you know... You said as soon as she got a job that you'd get her to move out. Shh... Quiet. That's not what I said. She needs time. Okay? We can't keep living here like this. - Okay. Shh. Be quiet. - I can't even sit on the goddamn... Go to the bathroom. Go. Fuck it. I'm too tired. - You're too tired? - This work business. Okay. Okay. Go to sleep, Dave. - Good night, Vera. - Good night, Slave Dave. Good night, everybody. Good night! Shut up. It's a slow night. You really want to know? - Okay. Well? - It's true, guys. But hey... I don't like big dicks. It's true. I like them smaller. Fits better. - If you are this size... - Oh, God. Or smaller, come get a private show... with me. No way. You're kidding me. Back to me. Hey, did you see that? Hey, did you see that? That's not okay. They can say whatever they want. No, no. He cannot call me that. We get called names too. No. That is different. That is not okay. He cannot just call me the N-word. Customer is always right. Chill. What? You don't think we get called names too? Fucking whore. Worthless pig.

You have to do something. - I... - You have to ban him! Did you not hear what just happened? - I heard everything, all right? - He just called me a nigger! - I know. I know. - I'm not gonna tolerate that! Look, look, look, look. I'm not banning him, all right? - What? - He's a good customer, all right? - A good customer? - Look! - If you wanna... - Oh, so you don't care about your...

We can't thank you enough for your great advice. Not only has our newfound lesbianism enhanced our friendship, but you've unleashed a whole new world of sexuality. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I bring you live lesbianism. - Oh, cock... - Oh, no! Oh, cock... Hey, Jez. Come here for a minute. I want you to see what we got going on in here. Ladies, Summer and Sky, I want you to meet the girl I was telling you about. This is Jezebel. - Hi, Jezebel. - Hey, Jezebel. - Hi. - Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Summer and Sky are award winning adult film stars. Um... - Do you recognize them? - Um... Sorry. - No? - It's okay. Um, do you do any video work? No. I just... I just do the web cam. Well, let us know if you change your mind. - Yeah. You'd be good. - You would be good. - You're super cute. - You are. These ladies are the best. So, if you're thinking about maybe adding to your resumé, I'd suggest working with them. You should come in here. You could be our third banana rider. Yeah. - Maybe you should join 'em? - Come on! What do you think? - Exactly. - Oh, my God. This is cute. This is gonna be great. I really think you should... - Chuck, come back later. - Do I have to? I probably should start work though. - Oh... - Oh. That's true. - Gotta make money. - Can we... Yeah. - Okay. - We'll come back. - Okay. Thank you. - We'll find you later. How do I... get off. - I know, right? Let's... - No, don't be sorry. - All right, ladies. - You're adorable. So, that Bobby guy really likes you, huh? Yep. What are you doing in there with him? Nothing special. Oh, I think you must be doing something special. You know that penetration is a prostitution charge, right? Yep. Your brother told me already. You know there's some of these guys in these chat rooms, they're undercover cops. They're just waiting to come in and get all of us. Bobby is not a cop. Be careful. I'm not going to jail for you. Good morning. Or is it good night for you? It's whatever you want it to be. Where's Sabrina? She took Juju in to the pharmacy. She got a little cold. Oh. - Where's Dominic? - Out there looking for jobs. Hey, I was just gonna watch a little TV. It's not gonna bother you, is it? It's fine. Damn, girl, you got some tiny little feet. So how's that job working out for you? It's fine. Yeah? Making a lot of money? I just started. Yeah, but you know the point of the job is to make a lot of money, right? Yeah. I think that's what it's about. That's great. Yeah, it'll come. It's good. So what do those guys on there want you to do anyway? I don't know. What did you want Sabrina to do when you used to call her? You really want to know? Hey. You sleepy, Tiff? Come on. Let's let her rest. It was good talking to you. Oh, here she comes. I think I hear her. Right? Is that her? - Oh, Jez. - Jezebel. Come here. Oh, hey. So... How did it go yesterday? - Oh... - Oh, great. - Yeah, no, really great. - Yeah. But we wanted to talk to you, um... for real. Um, look, I'm really not into any of the video stuff. I mean, no offense or anything, just not my thing. Oh, we totally get it. But we... like, we only do stuff together. Like, that's it. - Together? Oh. - Yeah. Jez. Chuck said that you've become his top performer. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. He said it happened, like, really fast, and that guys don't even want to see you naked. Well, actually, it's just one guy. Just one. Listen, we're gonna start our own site, okay, completely run by us. Girls only. Yeah. We know Chuck can be like, a total skeez, so... Jez. What do you think about coming to work for us? - We can do like, 20 an hour as a base. - Just for a start. Just to start. We heard about what happened. What that guy said to you. That would never ever happen with us. - That is so inappropriate. - It really is. - Yeah. - You shouldn't accept that. And your guys are gonna follow you. - They're gonna find you. - They'll find you. Who else knows about this? - No... - Just you. - No one. - But we are leaving today. So just, you know, think about it and call us. So when were you gonna tell me you were using my P.O. box? What are you talking about? You didn't see that box on the table when you just came in? Box? Oh. For me. Who's it from? Oh, my gosh. It's from Bobby. Sorry. I didn't know he was gonna actually send me something. Well he did, so open it. Okay. Oh, my gosh. Sabrina. Look. What? It says, "May I see you wear these next week when I'm in Vegas?" Try those on. Put 'em on. Okay. Oh, my gosh. They fit. Tight. Whoo! One down. Those are thigh highs. Can you walk in 'em? - Uh... - Get up. - Okay. - Let's see. Let's see. Don't fall. - Okay. - Okay. - Ooh! - Hot. - Okay. - Walk. Yes, yes. Yeah, yeah. What do you think Sabrina? You like it? Sabrina, do you like my boots? They look good. So you got this slave boy who wants to see you? - What's his name? - Bobby. Slave Boy Bobby. You got to get your own P.O. box though, okay? I know. And your own place. Not trying to put you out. It's just... I know. Dave has a job. You have a job. It's really crowded. - Dom's a busboy now. - Good for him. You should be able to get your own place. You know, something nice. Maybe even a weekly. I don't make enough for a weekly. You will. You're going to make enough. There's even a special right now. There's no deposit. Wow. Seems like you got it all figured out, huh? No, but we all got to figure it out. Wait. Let me get this straight. I have to go, but Dom and Dave, two grown men, can stay. Dave is my boyfriend. Dom just started working minimum wage. You're gonna be so much better when you have your own place. - It's gonna be better for you. - And how much does Dave make? - That's none of your business! - Huh? Five twenty... You know what? I'm just gonna go get my weekly right now. No one said you had to go right now. Yeah, you did. No one said you had to go right now. We just... We all have to figure things out. - Okay. - Okay. Whatever you say, Sabrina. I just don't want to be here when they come back. Tiff, you're gonna be better with your own place. Are you leaving? She... She's gonna be our neighbor, Juju. Don't worry. She'll be right over here. So uh, what did a porn star want with you the other day? Just be glad it was me that saw and not Vicky, who will tattle to her uncle. - I thought that was her brother. - Same difference. Found a boy. Go ahead. - Identify yourself. - Hello, Jez. - Identify yourself. - This is Bobby. - Wrong answer. - This is slave Bobby. That's better. I'm very sorry. You should be. Jez, I only did it so you wouldn't get in trouble, so they wouldn't suspect us. I sent you boots. I should choke you with my foot. - I'm completely yours. - Prove it. How? Jez! My office! Now! You yell at me? - Yes? - What? What the fuck was that? - What are you talking about? - What? You're ignoring Bobby? Our best customer? Oh. He likes it. He... He didn't look like he fucking liked it. Chuck, he does. And you're checking on our chats? Your chats? Those are my chats. This is my business. Well, do you look at Vicky's chats like that too? You can fucking go, all right? You're fucking fired! Get the fuck out! Leave! Open the door and leave. Hi, it's Jezebel from Babe Net. I'd like to take you up on your offer. Hello. It's Bobby. May we speak? Eight a.m. again. Very punctual. I kept calling and getting a busy signal. Yes, I was busy. Do you forgive me? No, I don't forgive you. But I'll tolerate you. I'll never get a show with anyone else again. That a slave boy. Can you get in trouble for this? You're already in trouble, Bobby. No. No. For this. For us talking. Well, as long as you don't tell anybody. Don't tell anybody. I worry about you. That's sweet. You like the boots? Yeah. I'm wearing them right now. I don't know if I'll be able to handle seeing you in those. We'll see. I can't believe that you will allow me to see you. Yes. But I'll expect a lot more from you. - Of course. - Mm-hmm. So don't book another show... a private show with anyone else. You send me that money. Five ninety-five a minute times... 90 minutes. That's 535 dollars and 50... Oh, you can add and multiply. Yeah. So are you gonna do it? Yes. I promise. Jezebel? - Yeah? - May I go now.? I'm on my work phone. Yes. Oh, so you're playing hooky with me again, are you Bobby? Yes. You are dismissed. Mmm. - It's not gonna be that good, okay? - Smells good. - You're that hungry? - Yes! Okay. How's your money? Um... I got fired. Are you kidding me? You got fired? But... hey, I found a new job anyway. So... You found a new job? Yeah, it's with these girls, um, Summer and Sky. - The porn stars? - Yeah. You trying to get into porn? Why? - No. - You don't have to do that. I'm not trying to get into porn. Well, what's going on? You're gonna have to explain this. No, no, no, no. It's a good job. Um... It's a good job because it's all women. I don't know. No, it's all women. And, like... You know, it's the same thing. Just because they're woman doesn't mean it's gonna be good. I mean, you have a good thing already. You need to move back in here? Is that why you're here? No, I um... I got everything under control. I have enough. - You sure? - Yeah. All right, well, eat up on that pizza. - Slim times coming. - Really? - No, I'm just kidding. - That is so mean. I can't believe you got fired. I can't... You know... You need to... This Bobby guy better be worth it because... - I don't know. You know... - He is. - He is? - He's worth it. How do you know? - I just have a feeling. - Those boots? - Those boots just got you just... - See those boots? - Yeah, those boots are pretty hot. - Mm. Bobby Boots. - Bobby Boots! Yeah. - Don't call him that. Bobby Boots. Bobby Boots. Bobby Boots. I love that! I hope Bobby can pay that weekly rent. It comes up real fast. - Real fast. - Okay, Sabrina. I'm here for my check. Look... Vicky and I did some... some thinking and uh... You know, I overreacted the other day. I got a little angry about what you said about her. And, I was a little out of line. I shouldn't have fired you the other day. - So we... we forgive you. - We forgive you. - My check. - Um... I think we both would like for you to come back and work for us tonight and work for us in the future. What do you think? I mean, unless you're already working somewhere else. Maybe a new site we heard about. Fine Chuck, I'll work for you tonight. But I have to wear this. This is what I have. Yeah, that's fine. And I want 20 dollars an hour now. Twenty dollars an hour? I want to make 20 dollars an... Can I make 20 dollars an hour? Can we all make 20 dollars an hour? Are you kidding me? Twenty dollars an hour, Jez? Is that what they were offering to pay you there? Is that too high, Vicky? - Yes. Yes it is. - Those back stabbing bitches! - Oh, my God. - We let 'em in here... - For a week. - One week. Fucking crazy. - Oh, my God. - How about 17 dollars an hour? That's more than anybody else makes here. That's very generous. No, that's not gonna work for me, Chuck. That's not gonna work for you? You show up for your first day in a fucking training bra. - Vic... - No. And now you have the nerve to tell me you're not gonna work - for 17 fucking dollars an hour? - Vic. Vicky. - That's ungrateful. That's ungrateful. - Go get a show. Go get a show right now. Lovely. It's fucking ungrateful. Look, Jez, you may think the grass is greener on the other side, but I can tell you there's some bad people in this business. If you're not careful, you'll get burned. There's people in this industry that will take advantage of you, and they will fuck you over and fuck you hard. All right. I'm looking out for you. Thank you for your concern, Chuck. Do we have a deal or not? Let's keep it between us. But, yeah. I don't even want Vicky to know about this. All right? And no more guys using those words. That word. I'll tell you what, um... How about this. They use the word we warn 'em. They do it again, we ban 'em. That's the best I can do. It's freedom of speech. It's the law. That's all I can do. All right? Come on. Do we have a deal? Come on. Thank you. They look pretty. What are you doing? - Sorry. It's... - Okay. Remember what I told you. Keep it... Sorry. Sorry. - Keep it sophisticated. Okay? - I'm sorry. Okay. - Be a lady. - I get it from you though. - Be a lady. - Yes. A lady. - Be a lady. - I'm a lady. - Hi, Bobby. - Dinner. Glass. Pinky. - Pinky. - Okay? Hi, Bobby. How are you? No, Bobby, you may not. I think you shouldn't let him talk at all. - Oh! Oh, that's good. - Don't let him talk at all. Who said you could talk? - Be quiet. Shh. - Be quiet. Here we go. I'm scared. Oh, don't be scared. I'm proud of you. Thank you. - Thank you. - I didn't do nothin'. Yes, you did. Hey. Don't mess up your wing tip. No. Don't mess up your wing tip. - I can't... - Hey... Hey, come here. Come here. - It's a date. - I know. - It's a date. - I know. And you... are... Jezebel.
