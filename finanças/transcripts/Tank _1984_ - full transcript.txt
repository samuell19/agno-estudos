[ men exclaim, whistle ] put it on that side. sergeant major carey! sergeant major carey! you calling me? sergeant major carey? yeah. i'm jerry elliott from soldier magazine. we'd like to interview you and take pictures. i just got here. how did you find me so quick? you aren't exactly the unknown soldier. what's a soldier's magazine's interest in interviewing me? you're the only one in the u.s. army who owns a fully operational sherman tank. i thought everybody had one. i knew a sergeant who made a lamp out of one. how long did it take you to restore it? close to 15 years. spare part here, spare part there. did it mostly with my sons. how old are they? well, billy, he's 16, and jonathan... would be 22. he's dead. i'm sorry to hear that. is this tank all original? everything except the loudspeaker and tape deck for parades. that way, it could be declared a public relations asset. why would anybody want a sherman tank? it's hard to shoot yourself while cleaning it. one, two, three, four, hey! one, two, three, four, hey! this is the way we start our day! this is the way we start our day! knockin' down doors and kickin' down walls! knockin' down doors and kickin' down walls! [ intercom buzzes ] yes. general hubik, sergeant major carey to see you. great. send him in. reporting for duty, sir. good to see you, general. well, well, for an old fart, you look great. with your permission, i'd say the same about you. how's ladonna? fine, sir. and your wife? she has her moments. all squared away? just about. there's a sergeant elliott looking for you. already found me, sir. he got me before i had a chance to test the latrines. we're going for a drive. you're creating quite a stir with that tank of yours. i pulled a few strings to let you keep your tank here. i appreciate that, sir. if i may say so, i'm glad my last assignment is going to be under you, sir. we're too young for last assignments. yes, sir, but i have made an offer on a fishing boat. if they accept it, i'll put in my papers. give me two years, and you may be the next sergeant major of the army. [ man shouting commands ] i can't tell you how much i appreciate that coming from you, but it gets complicated. i only have one son left. he's only got a few more years at home. that time won't ever come again. i've learned that, sir. there'll be time to talk about that later. pentagon duty isn't half bad for a family. neither is fishing, sir. in your hat, sergeant major. yes, sir, three bags full. rear guard, recover! next? kitchen. i've talked with your mom and dad. what about you? what's it like having a command sergeant major for a father? made me more religious. really? how's that? i've realized the problems jesus must have had, being the son of god. what sort of father is your dad? a cross between george patton and danny thomas. like he says, "shit rolls downhill. "if it's a bad day at the post, it's the wrong day to look like a ragbag at home." you call about the boat? yeah. you didn't tell me. you didn't ask me. it's like pulling teeth to get information out of you. what did he say? he'll call in a couple of weeks. probably waiting to see if they can get more. i hope interest rates don't go up. what if they do? they won't. what if they do? do i tell them they can't do that 'cause ladonna carey said so? you're as nervous about that boat as about that tank. go to the n.c.o. club. see if we know anybody on this post. you're a pretty good old broad. just watch who you're calling old. jesus, you're a nervous old woman.

"william carey-- "possession of narcotics, "possession with intent to sell same, "assaulting a peace officer, and resisting arrest." if i know the judge-- and he's my brother-in-law-- this could get that boy of yours two years on the county farm. all right, sheriff, like i said, you win. give me a number. i'll pay. you get to the heart of the matter. i'm going to let you come up with the number, but after you've visited our correctional facility. move it! move it! come on, boy! move it! move it! move it! come on, boy! come on, come on. hurry! we practice a modern form of penology here. we try to rehabilitate the prisoners through a system of positive and negative feedback. the work here, that's a privilege. and that's positive feedback. on the other hand, well... trustee jackson! yeah, boss! show us an example of negative feedback. right now, boss. you, boy! you're lazy! that's what's wrong with you! i get the point. you don't need to do this for me. no, sergeant, this ain't the army. here i say the "have-tos" and "don't have-tos." i say that youngster's malingering. that's antisocial behavior that calls for negative feedback. shut up! shut up! shut up! you're just lazy. that's all that's wrong! i hope you found our tour helpful. give me a number, and you got it. that's the trouble with your kind. you don't appreciate subtlety. you come down here to change our ways, because the supreme court's on your side. you're finding out we ain't broken-legged. want a number? $10,000. what do you think the army pays? i wouldn't know. i'm an ignorant cracker, but soldier magazine wrote a story on you. said you owned your own tank and just bought a fancy boat. that sounds like a millionaire to a poor boy like me. i bet you could sell that boat and raise that money. [ gate buzzes ] oh, sergeant... uh...one more thing. i think it would be inadvisable for you to bring some jew lawyer here to talk about civil rights. i'd have your boy on this farm before you can say "habeas corpus." okay, sheriff, you'll get everything you want, but remember, anything happens to my boy, nothing will prevent me from killing you. he's the only thing keeping you alive. and vice versa, sergeant. you remember that. billy, are you okay? i didn't do what they say. somebody's else's lock was on my locker. it has nothing to do with you. then why am i sitting in this jail? no, it's the sheriff. the sheriff's using you to get me. i'll do what he wants, then you're out. but why, dad? it's a long story. once you're out, i'll tell you everything. you'll get out, understand? okay. can you hang in here? yes, sir. that's the way to talk to these guys-- "yes, sir" and "no, sir." in a day or two, you'll be out of here, i promise. have i ever broken a promise? no, sir. i'm not gonna start. i promise you i will get you out of here. that's a promise. bastard! you rotten, filthy bastard! my baby's in jail, because you went whoring. we'll get billy back, then you do whatever you have to. oh, no. i've got this figured out. we can cut those bills-- no! we are getting a lawyer! our son will not be handled between good ol' boys. you have no right to talk. you don't understand. this guy's evil. we're not doing things his way or your way. i'm getting a lawyer. you have no right to tell me different. you left your rights on a barroom floor! ladonna! ladonna! all right, talk to a lawyer, but don't take any action without telling me first. i'll do the same. okay? okay? [ horn honks ] zack! [ horn honking ] zack! first sergeant, take over the inspection. what is it? i tried, zack. i didn't understand what you meant. i didn't believe you. believe me about what? about the sheriff. oh, christ! move over. he's here, sheriff. well, lookee who's here-- mr. stupid. you are as dumb as you can be. i told him not to bring lawyers in, but he wouldn't listen to me. we get some big lawyer in from out of county, we don't want to waste his time, so we held a trial. now you know what? your lawyer's in jail--contempt of court. we'll finish this conversation in my office. take the money. give me my son. please. oh, you do know the magic word. sergeant, it's my sad duty to report your son was sentenced to three years on the county farm. i'll take the money. it'll keep him alive for a year. after that, i'll take more. we made a deal! any more lawyer noise, and he'll be shot attempting escape. yes, sir. i got power to do almost anything on that farm, except stop the course of true love. that i can't do. you see, unfortunately, we do have some degenerates on the farm. unless i'm mistaken, they'll fall in love with your little boy. of course, it will be a learnin' experience for him. sheriff told me why i was here, before he beat me. 'cause of you and your whore! bill. was she worth it? look at me! [ telephone rings ] hubik. are you sure? well, stop him. block the main gate.

[ crowd laughs ] shit. don't let this take all day. here, sarah. handcuff him to that post over there. go on. go! can i go with you? i can't stay here. jump on. yeah. let's go. okay, now. you stay there. close the hatch. what are you doing? you're crazy! lie down, billy, i'm coming to get you. lie down. damn it, lie down! you're crazy! you'll get us killed! ooh! yea! all right! yea! hooray! okay! yea! well, where is this invading army we're supposed to stop? holy shit! i'd sure like to help, but-- governor, i got a crazy sergeant. i got a dope fiend, and a hooker in a sherman tank! they've destroyed three squad cars, two trucks, my office, and a '74 chevy! call out the national guard and blow that son of a bitch away! i suppose i could, but that would take a lot of time. see what the army can do for you, buddy. in clemmonsville today, there was an unusual prison break. sergeant major zack carey broke his son out of the county correctional facility using a sherman tank. all right. thank you, son. what's your big plan? we'll head for the tennessee state line over back roads and broken country. it'll slow them down. what's she doing here? bill, look, once you get across the state line, if they want you, they have to extradite you. that means a fair hearing in a court of law. what's she? my lawyer? at that hearing, sarah will testify that she was forced into prostitution, and you and i can tell our story. they'll believe us over a sheriff? that sheriff is not part of the system. in a fair hearing, a lawyer can work. we're not running away from the law. we're running t the law, bill. we'll win. they'll lose, general! they're going down in flames, and you're going to help. i can have the governor call your superior. either way, want to see some tanks rolling out of here to stop that maniac. i don't take orders from governors. sergeant major carey's resigned. he's committed no crime in my jurisdiction. he stole a tank! it's his tank. all he did was bust a fence. i'm the local civilian authority. i'm making a formal request of the military to do everything in its power to assist me in apprehending-- posse comitatus, sheriff. did you call me a pussy communist? the u.s. army is, by congress' posse comitatus act, precluded from enforcing civilian law outside the military reservation. pussy communist? i cannot provide you with military equipment or personnel without a direct order from my superior or the president. i can give you his address. sheriff cyrus buelton has deputized an additional 200 men to help apprehend the tank before it reaches the tennessee state line, apparently its destination, according to a cb broadcast from sergeant carey. now... a tank is not what you want to call a fuel-efficient vehicle. he ain't driving a toyota! it ain't far to empty on a sherman tank. i'm putting one of you in every filling station between here and the state line. he'll have to pump his own gas. when that happens, it'll be my pleasure to shoot that sergeant in his privates. [ dogs barking ] who's that out there? don't make any noise. i don't want to hurt you. i just need some gas. okay? you the one they talking about on television with that tank? maybe. my sister had a boy on that farm. he never came back. you're welcome to anything you need. [ liquid pouring ] all right, mr. gant. that ought to do her. i thank you, sir. thank your wife for her chicken. you're welcome, ma'am. best of luck, sergeant. thank you. sergeant, my wife's a church-going woman. she's praying for y'all. that's nice. thank you. okay, you guys. finish eating. we're going to move out. now, a few words about mr. gant. he has aided and abetted escaped felons. normally, i would arrest him. i can't do that because those same felons did destroy my jail. however... long about tonight, he'll wish he was in a safe jail, especially if some of his fellow citizens show up to express negative feedback on account of his helping escaped convicts, dope addicts, and prostitutes. isn't that an invitation to violence? violence don't need an invitation from me. that from sheriff buelton, clemmons county's chief law enforcement officer. meanwhile, the manhunt for the tank continues. this is ken billings in the tv-9 skywatch chopper. we were able to obtain these exclusive pictures. however, we were spotted, and the tank disappeared into dense woods. a tank should be easy to spot, but when carey doesn't want to be seen, he evidently will not be seen. there you are, jim. billy. we got them spotted. he's headed through that thicket country, then into them bogs. he's heading for the bogs. we got us a possum hunt! if he doubles back, nobody will give him any gas. not after what's going to happen tonight! my wife and kids is gone! you want to try and burn me out? you go to it! i'll tell you, i'll take two of you with me! this is the tank. you assholes better move! thanks, mr. gant. you're welcome, honey. help yourself to anything you need now. billy, here. take this. i know how you feel about me. nothing happened between your father and me. we sat at the bar, that's all. looks like that was enough. nothing happened because of him. he just wanted to talk. if he hadn't been there, this wouldn't have happened. if he took me out back, nothing would've happened either. if he would've been like any other guy with $20 that would've been the end of it. you should hate him for not taking me back there, or hate me for not being sexy enough to get him there. you can think of many reasons to hate, but your father deserves better. that's where the sheriff thinks you are now. that's where we would've been. you'd have been stuck. he's got 10 mack trucks blocking the road. how can we get around them? see that holler? that'll take you out. that's stump country, but that won't hurt that thing you drivin'. they're not in the bogs. they must've doubled back. that pussy communist. hold on, you two. we're going for a rough ride. [ engine stops ] wouldn't that just frost them? what is it? i do believe we threw a track. start up the tank. when sarah says, inch it forward. all right. sarah, get back. when i say it's okay, tell billy to move it forward. right. damn it! all right... okay! no! billy, he's hurt! i think i've broken some ribs. don't move, dad. oh, it's my fault. no, it isn't. get the first aid kit out of the tank. sarah, put this stuff back in the tank. i'm getting a doctor. you're coughing up blood. you two set out on foot. get me off to the side. i'm not leaving. billy, look, it's like a war. you lick your wounds after the battle. horseshit. i'm not leaving you. i'm not asking you, i'm ordering you. you order soldiers. i'm your son. i'm getting a doctor. no, billy. look, the sheriff will get all of us. we don't have any choice. then we're all getting out of here. i can drive this tank as good as you. i'll get us across that state line. billy, you don't have to prove anything to me. i'm not proving anything. that's you and johnny. i'm like mom. practical. i love you... more than anyone on earth. can you understand that? you put your life on the line for me for something that wasn't your fault. now you can lean on me. i love you, son. i just want you safe. that's all. i know. let's get on with it. let's get going. you okay? you sure you can run this thing? he helped build it. you better believe he can drive it. we're not going to move by night. we'll go on the main road. see that cracker stop a tank. [ engine starts ] 16-year-old william carey broadcast an s.o.s. his father was injured fixing a thrown track. william requested first aid instructions. since the battle of gant's farm, the tank's crew are becoming folk heroes, especially to school children. high school children are holding up signs that read, "right on, tank." and what does sheriff buelton say? these men are criminals. we're talking about an escaped convict and a man wanted for assault and a known-- excuse the expression-- prostitute. these people in that tank aren't heroes. but they do have a tank. the bible says, "might does not make right." that boy made a serious mistake when he came back up on this road. we're gonna stop him. we know where, when and how we're gonna do it. this is fort clemmons. we have mrs. carey on the line. how bad's he hurt? billy? billy! you have to release the button to hear him. mom, he's got some internal bleeding. you tell your dad... you tell him i'm sorry for the stuff i said. and i love him. and i love you. you're a pretty good old broad. don't you die on me, you son of a bitch. don't you dare die on me. this is jason price from the georgia state line, where hundreds are gathered with more every minute at what will be the finish line of the most bizarre race ever run i the tank can make it. we're with ladonna carey at the tennessee state capitol. why didn't the governor see you? the governor said he couldn't spare five minutes. what are you going to do? i'd like to ask every woman to imagine that it were her son and husband, and phone the governor. ask him to spare five minutes just five minutes to a woman who's trying to save her family. i'm going to stay here until he does. state capitol. state capitol. yes, he'll get the message. state capitol. 300 calls so far. who needs this shit? i say yes, i'm harboring an escaped convict. i say no, then i shot jesse james. [ intercom buzzes ] who needs it? yeah? do whatever you have to do. and keep me advised. state troopers office. 1,000 people have gathered on our side of the state line. senators don't have to deal with this shit! tell mrs. carey i'll meet with her. billy! billy carey! this is ken billings of wgaz-tv 9. we're above you. you read me? loud and clear. how's it going? how's your dad? not too hot. he's got some internal bleeding. will he make it across the state line? we'll make it across. what will you do then? will you surrender? i won't let the sheriff take my dad. that's some kid. that's some old man. if he wants to make this the last stand at the alamo, then that's what we'll do. because we've got a load of firepower. we'll get to the real law. for a long time, like every other kid, i thought my dad was wrong about many things, but not anymore. he doesn't have to prove anything to me. the bottom line is, he's my father and i love him. if that sheriff tries hurting him, i'll blow him away. [ cheering ] that little shit's running for governor. i have sympathy for your plight, but this is a delicate matter. i'm asking they get a fair hearing before you hand them over to buelton. it's not quite that simple. there are other considerations. what considerations? this is a very church-conscious state. i'm talking about a christian act of justice. in all candor, i'd find it difficult to put the prestige of the governorship behind two men in a tank with a 20-year-old prostitute. governor, that's my husband and son in that tank with that prostitute. if i have no problem with that, why should you? we look at it from different perspectives. well, my perspective has a dozen reporters from every tv, radio station and newspaper you can think of, waiting for me to make a statement. i'll either tell them they have a governor to be proud of who's willing to see justice done, no more, no less. or i'll say their governor is an asshole! which is it going to be? are you threatening the governor with blackmail? yes, sir, i am! euclid! euclid! euclid, will you come here? yes, sir. where's aavery? he's coming right now. you aavery? yes, sir. where did you get that? sheriff bucks loaned it to me. he had it up on his wall. they tell me you can shoot this. is that right? that's all i did in the army. here's the plan. the tank will come up this road. he can't get over those trucks. he'll veer off this road into this field. he'll get stuck in the mud. that'll happen. that's what i said! when that happens, you fire to immobilize the tank. i don't care if he can shoot. i don't want him to move. piece of cake. hit him in the track, blow that track. that'll stop him for sure. governor, have you talked to mrs. carey? yes, we have. have you made a decision? yes, we have made a decision. if mrs. carey's husband and son reach our jurisdiction, a complete hearing will occur in which we'll examine the facts before extradition is granted. where is mrs. carey? she's on her way to the state line. where i'll join her within the hour. hang in there, dad. i think we're home free. the governor will fight the extradition. zack, billy, you've won! all right! we are ready! euclid, get them water trucks out of here. everybody, get behind this dirt ramp. the road's blocked with trucks. i'm going around. go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! go! hold him there. hold him. now get him! that's all right. don't be nervous, squeeze the trigger. but if you miss again, it's your ass! keep going, son. we did it! we got him! i'm happy as a pig in shit! maybe you ain't a faggot after all. all right. the game is over. come out and surrender. no! no! no! drop on it, sheriff. get down, boys! down! that betrays a negative attitude, billy boy. but that's all right. we got all the time in the world and we can wait. [ gunfire ] fire away, billy boy. we got a long day ahead of us. just sit there and enjoy the afternoon sun. [ helicopter approaching ] move those people back. isn't there anything they can do? they've got no engine. they gotta be pulled out. what are you doing? stealin'. when it gets dark, you two go out through the hatch and slip across the line. i won't let you die. i'm staying with you. bill... sheriff. if i surrender, will you get medical attention to my father? i hear you, billy. yes, sir. you give up now, i'll see your daddy gets to the hospital. you got sheriff buelton's word. what the hell is that? cover me. shoot that hippie! let the governor through. good old son of a bitch! goddamn! pull! everybody, pull! pull! pull it! pull! pull! pull! pull! pull! shoot into that crowd! you shoot, and we'll turn this into little big horn. stop them out there! come on! grab that cable! haul that cable in! pull! pull! come on, governor! pull! we've got to try something else. follow me. [ cheering ] get those tables out of the way! move it! i got you, you son of a bitch. come out of that tank or i'll burn you out! i'll fry you alive! you hear me? i'll pour gasoline down that hatch, 'cause you have lost, sergeant, and i won! hook her up. hook her up! we stopped a sherman tank! we didn't get no help from the governor, army-- [ crowd cheering ] pull! pull! i'm coming, sheriff! sheriff-- you syphilitic bolshevik! you pervert! you pussy communist! pull! pull! come on! pull! pull! pull! pull! pull! pull! you did real good, old girl.
