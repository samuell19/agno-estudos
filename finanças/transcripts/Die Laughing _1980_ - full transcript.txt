Hey, you know, according to the 6:00 news, you're the murderer, not me. 6:00 news? Yeah. On every channel. Every time I switch stations, "pinsky, pinsky, pinsky! Homicidal maniac." So, uh... Did you kill two or three? One channel said three. Three? You, uh...Plugged a famous nuclear scientist in the back seat of your cab. You...blew up his wife after you shot her in the brains, and you knocked a guy off a building with your trusty guitar. Little man, you've had a busy day. I didn't blow up anybody's wife. Oh, that's a relief. Hey. On the TV, did they say anything about my music or my group? Pinsky, you have a one-track mind. No, they didn't say anything about your music or your group. Oh.

[Lock clicks] The authority. You don't know a damn thing about me. [Man] Pinsky... Daniel. Age 22. Height--6 feet. Weight--150 pounds. Eyes--blue-gray. Hair--brown. The perpetrator was abandoned--age 10. Placed in state institution. Ran away--age 14. Lived on city streets with street friends, including a year with a Chinese family named Lao fung. A long record as a juvenile. All petty offenses. Arrested for vagrancy. Placed on probation by the juvenile courts into the custody of his probation officer-- miss Katie Arnold. Employed as a cabdriver by Katie's son-- Arnold Arnold, who claims to have contracted a duodenal ulcer because of the accused. Pinsky's been having a thing with a female Caucasian-- Courtney Adams. The lady has no criminal record. Pinsky's stayed out of trouble the last few years, except for 78 unpaid parking tickets. [Man] Well, the little dingus is in trouble now, and this time, he won't work it off in traffic school. Maybe you should just turn yourself in. Hey, you got anything to eat in here? Warm beer and cold pizza. Thanks a lot. Well, I'm not a cooking major. My field is business. Your field is business, o.K.-- well, if you're innocent, you'd turn yourself in. And the nice, sympathetic cops will say, "hey, man, it's cool. "There's a corpse under the window of your apartment. "There's a dead man in your cab. "Your fingerprints are on the murder weapon. "But since you're in a very important contest this week, "you may go, pinsky, because we like you, pinsky." But, pinsky, if you're-- Amy. Amy, I've been on the streets all my life, see? And the one thing I learned is, cops don't like me. They don't like me. Well, let me help you, then. O.k. Tell me where Courtney is. She'll help me. I think you better just take a walk. You know what, Amy? I'm getting tired of you. [Scratching] [Whispering] What was that? What was what? They must have followed me here. Who? I don't know. It's the box. They came to get the box. Amy, the lights! Amy, be careful. Amy, no! Yaah! [Sighs] There's no one in the hall. Amy the ripper. What's in that box, anyway? I don't know, but if I'm going to get killed for it... I sure as hell want to find out. Yeah. What do you mean, "yeah"? It's got tiny little holes in it. Can you see in? Amy... Cut the strap. [Screeching] Get it off me! Aah! A monkey? [Chattering] Everybody's killing each other for a monkey? Oh, he's scared to death. Poor thing! You hungry? What's this, I wonder. You want something to eat? Are you kidding? Monkeys don't eat pizza. That will kill him for sure. Well, he's eating it. Man, inside this box stinks. "Ivan... "Skodbodni. "3 P.M. Saturday. "Igor zhukov. "Enclosed are three injections... To be used as sedatives."

Amy, you don't know what you're talking--aah! [Screeching] Amy! What did you do that for? Because I don't want to see you get hurt. Well, you got a weird way of showing it. Uhh... Huh? What are you doing? Courtney! Ooh! Come here. Come here, honey. O.k. Come on. Aahh. Aahh. [Door opens] Hi. You're home early. Cut it out. [Courtney] Amy, Steve. Steve, Amy. Steve has a house in the country. I just need my overnight bag. Want to see my bedroom, Steve? Ha ha ha! Hmm... [Thud] [Man] That's Daniel pinsky? It's pathetic. I can't tell what his face even looks like. How are we supposed to find him if we don't even know what he looks like, huh? Oh, that's lovely. Lovely work. My god, Thelma. Unbelievable. The camera work is substandard. Well, he was running so fast, and the day was so hot. My eyes were just stinging away with perspiration. Besides... You know I have no training at picture-taking, darling. Please don't call me darling. I no longer need a nanny. Thank you, Thelma. What kind of camera did you use-- an X-ray machine? That is so droll. Honey, will you protect me from my bloodthirsty son of a bitch? Let's just get one thing straight. Any criticism of this operation emanates from me, period. Is that perfectly clear? [Thelma] Well, yes, sweet pea. Oh, now you all mad at me... Just like when you were a baby. Now, you just relax. Don't touch me. Baby! Honey! Don't do that! Julikins. Thelma, please. You know nobody ever touches me. You also know my name is not julikins. I am really quite distressed with all of you. I'm afraid this little pinsky may be a problem. I want him worse than you do. Then why don't you use your brain, Mr. Bock? Ask questions, for heaven's sake. Find out who his friends are, where they congregate. See if he's dating anyone in particular. Get him, Mr. Bock... Before somebody else does. All right, now. Go ahead. Find pinsky. He has my monkey. Shoot. I'm getting a headache. Thelma, get that analyst on the phone. What did I do with my valium? [Pinsky] Amy, how could you lock me up in the closet all night when I should have been out there trying to clear myself? You're on the front page. Oh, man. See what I mean? Now I'm a murderer on the front page. If you knew what winning that contest means to me and my friends. Five years, we've been playing 15-bucks-a-night club dates in places like modesto and redwood city. Hot dog stand openings, election rallies, wakes... Yeah, wakes. And you really think you have a chance to win? If I don't get busted. [Tuning] [Chattering] Hey, what's going on? I don't know. Well, why is he acting like that? [Chattering] Maybe he's looking for a place to dump that cold pizza you fed him last night. Not likely. He's already done that several times. Oh, great! There goes my term paper on the federal reserve system. Now you'll get an "a" on it. He's just hungry. That's all. Oh, my baby just wanted his breakfast, didn't he? Yeah. He did. [Tuning] It's just gibberish. What did you expect-- Shakespeare? Hey, you know your breakfast is getting cold! Come on. Don't you want to eat something? Come on. Eat your tofu and wheat germ. Amy... This ain't no ordinary monkey. Hmm. Hmm! Ha ha! That tofu stuff will kill you. Ha ha! And where's my shirt? Right behind you. Don't you remember? I washed it. Thank you. Anytime the victim's blood gets on your shirt, just bring it on over. All right, men. Come on. Arm's length. Men, we have a mission. One of our men is missing in action. Pinsky's out there somewhere in no-man's-land, cut off from his outfit. The cops think he's a killer, but we know different. Pinsky's one of us. [Man clears throat] Uh-huh. Sort of. Men, wherever the battle takes you today, look for pinsky, from the halls of the cow palace to the shores of sausalito. 50 bucks to the driver who spots-- um, drop that. Um... 20 bucks to the driver who spots him first and radios in. Arnold... I want to talk to you. Oh... O.k. Dismissed! [Charlie] I think this is a perfect choice for your wife. [Telephone rings] For yourself, check that out. Revolutions are coming back in. Masquerade. [Pinsky] Hello, Charlie. Pinsky! Are you o.K.? Yeah. Yeah, sure. Listen. Did you get my note? Yeah. I got your note. Look. You're in jail, aren't you, pinsky? I knew this would happen. Don't worry. We'll get you out. We'll get a good lawyer, and we can do prison benefits. No, man. I'm not in the cooler. I'm safe. Call the guys and tell them, o.K.? Look. Here's what I'll do. I'll cancel the semi-finals. Charlie, we're not canceling anything. We play...Today. O.k. Look. I got a question for you. How are we going to get in and out of the building without being noticed? You take care of that. Do your stuff. What? Use the shop, scout the place. Oh... I got you. [Man] All right, Mr. Arnold. Would you like to try it one more time? [Arnold mumbling] Stand on your Mark there-- tape right on the floor. You ready? O.k. Roll tape. And just go right ahead. Would you kindly repeat the question? Did he ever give you any indication he might be a murderer? You think I'd hire anybody to drive for me who wasn't an o.K., straight guy? He never gave me no indication he could kill anything, except cabs. He killed my cabs... And me. He's killing me. Folks... I run a first-class operation here-- kourtesy, komfort, and kuickness. Just dial 390-9009. Red & blue's got a cab for youse. Pinsky wrote that, that little pecker. Cut. 390-9009. Uh, I told you, you can't use that kind of language on TV, Mr. Arnold. Ah, shit. Mr. Arnold, would you like us to write this down so you can just read it? No, no. Let me-- I can get it. O.k. All right. Ready? Roll tape. Just pick up where you left off. Oh, yeah, sure. Well, would you turn the camera on? Turn the camera on. Roll 'em. [Tires screech] [Ringing] Hello. Hello. Amy? Yeah. How's the monkey? Because I got to pick it up after the semi-finals. Well, where you going now? Bayshore and Geneva. That's where that guy in my cab--Dr. Stowe-- asked me to take him before he got it. Pinsky, be careful. Ivan skodbodni. Igor zhukov. Oh, man.

Chocolate milk? How is your head? It's great. 'Cause you and I are going to have a little chat, and I would like you to be as clearheaded as possible. Where is my monkey, Mr. Pinsky? Look, man, I'm not telling you another thing until you tell me who the hell you are and why you want the monkey! There's really no need to threaten, Mr. Pinsky. My name is Mueller. And I'm in the process of executing a plan that will eternally, indelibly, immortally burn my name right alongside the giants of history. You've got one hell of a plan if you can't make it work without a monkey. It's a perfect plan, Mr. Pinsky. It's an exquisitely perfect plan. There are many computers like this one all over the world, each one programmed exactly the same. Everything ever published in the field of nuclear physics you'll find right in here. One such computer's in Moscow. Another was at Dr. Stowe's disposal at the university. Dr. Stowe, poor thing. Brilliant physicist, stupid man. I was his best student. I duplicated this computer all by myself. Uh, actually, I've been building things like this ever since I was a... Little baby. That's really sweet. Last year, Dr. Stowe perfected the most magnificent formula for the United States government-- how to quickly and cheaply convert nuclear waste into weapons-grade plutonium. Unfortunately, Dr. Stowe wanted to share this information with the Russians also so that no one nation could become too powerful. Lame idea. The FBI found out his intentions, and they began watching him. They interviewed me, asked me if I'd watch him. I watched him. That's when I thought up my plan. Dr. Stowe taught his formula to a monkey? Precisely. So if you get the monkey... I'll be able to take cheap, easily acquired nuclear waste and build my own weapons-grade plutonium. Actually, I already have a warehouse full of rockets just like this one. I bought them from the Costa Ricans. They got theirs from the Ethiopians. The Ethiopians bought theirs from the Cubans. The Cubans got theirs from the Russians. The Russians won theirs in the Irish sweepstakes. [Snort] Ha ha ha! Hello. Mr. President. Yeah, uh, statue of Liberty-- in 5 seconds, my very own, rather small nuclear-tipped rocket will destroy the beacon in her right hand. Whoosh! Boom! Oh, my dear. Terribly sorry, Mr. President. Seems miss Liberty's entire right arm... Oh, my goodness. Part of that right breast, too. Now, naturally, I could hold entire cities for ransom. [Telephone beeping] Cities, not titties. Uh, you know. New York, uh... San Francisco, Washington. But, uh, what the hey. All you really have to do to save your nation, Mr. President, is fork over, say, 5-- ehh, make it 15 billion, uh, bananas... Artichokes... Uh, dollars. 50 billion anything. Doesn't really matter. I'm not impressed. Mr. Pinsky, join up with me, and I'll see that all your wildest dreams come true. I'll see that all my wildest dreams come true. And let me tell you something that might save you a lot of time. You can't blackmail an entire nation. Arabs do it with oil. Brazilians do it with coffee. No. You've lost, Mr. Pinsky. I'm the winner. Now, join up with me before it's too late. Where is my monkey? I'm not telling you anything, and I don't care what you do to me. What makes you think I'm going to do anything you? You little nothing. You little nit. All right. Make yourselves comfortable. Oh, by the way, tomorrow you'll talk, or you'll die. [Door slams] Daniel. Would it help any if I said... What? Well, you got a hell of a way with words. Roll over. Why? I'll try and untie your ropes. There's no way we're going to get out of this room. Well, escape isn't exactly what I had in mind. Oh, yeah? It's crazy. Yeah. Let's be crazy. Far out. Uh-huh. [Horn honking] We've got company. Company? [Katie] What's wrong? Won't this damn thing go any faster? Ma, the sun's in my eyes, the road's dusty, and I can't see where I'm going! You drive better that way. Come on! Faster! I'm leading this attack, ma! The left flank's getting sloppy, Fred, and the rear guard back there-- let's close it up. Let's do this by the book, men. Book! Huh! My Fanny. Slightly better, Arnold. Thanks, ma. Mickey, come on. Now, be careful. This could be a big one. All right, Jimmy. Let's go. Now, hold it a minute. Uh! Ooh! Punk. You guys go on inside. I'm going around the back. This is too much. My comput-- my comput-- if that little boy puts one finger on my machine, I don't know what I'm going to do. Pinsky! Oh, kind and loving sweet virgin Mary... Holy mother of god... Get out here, you son of a bitch! You pig! Pinsky! [Pinsky] Arnold? Pinsky! Arnold! These people hurt you? No? Then I'm going to kill you. Where's my fares and my cab? I'm the one who drove it here. Arnold, Amy. Amy, Arnold. I hope he don't treat you like he treats my cabs. He won't. Oh, Arnold! Enough of that! Come on! Lead the way, little lady. Isn't he great? [Katie] Get him! Behind you! Bring him over here! Ooh! Oh, my god! Aah! Ugh! My computer... Nobody ever touches my computer. Look, Daniel. Um... Could I just talk to you for one minute-- don't! Don't you dare! Hello, Mr. President? There's been a change in plans. Ah! Uh! Uh! Aah! Amy, where are you going? Across the farm! Come on! If you're going to go, go! Let's go! Move it! You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. You better have my money. What about Katie? Is Katie all right? Katie's all right. She's around here somewhere. Here? Well, what did she do with the monkey? Screw the monkey! What do you mean? Where's my money? No. I got to know about the monkey! Some guy stole the monkey. Some fat Russian commie took it. Amy, get in. [Engine starts] Hey! Come back! Where you going with my cab? Oh, not again! Damn! Zhukov's got the monkey! We got to find him, or I'll never clear myself. [Amy] Damn. The circus was here yesterday. [Pinsky] Ivan skodbodni, 3 P.M., Saturday. Ivan skodbodni, 3 P.M., Saturday. That's today. I know that. What does Ivan skodbodni do at 3 P.M., Saturday? Why don't we just find out what town the circus goes to next? Pinsky, this is impossible. Let's just go to the police. What did you say? This is impossible. Let's just go to the police. No, no, no. Where the circus goes next? It goes nowhere... Not with a hot monkey. Ivan skodbodni, 3 P.M., Saturday. Oh, come on. 3 P.M., Saturday. Oh, come on. Uh... Uh! Oh, man. Ivan skodbodni, 3 P.M., Saturday. It sails back to Russia. Come on. [Elephant trumpeting] Pinsky... [Muttering] O.k. [Muttering] Pinsky! [Muttering] There! [Whistling] Hide! Back in here!

Come on! Give me your hand! [Amy] Go, go! Comrades, get them! I don't believe it. I don't believe it! Take it easy, Mr. Pinsky. My name is Davis. I'm with the FBI. [Pinsky] FBI? All right. All right. Listen. She didn't do anything, o.K.? Well, neither did you, Mr. Pinsky. We know everything. I've been chasing you for days, trying to tell you that you're free. You're free and clear. I'm free? Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, young lady. Huh. Well, the local constabulary-- come on, darling. The local constabulary may have something to say about the 78 parking tickets, but you're all clear with uncle Sam. You've been chasing me for days, trying to tell me that I'm free? Ha ha! Don't try anything funny, comrade. [Pinsky] You know, you ought to arrest that guy. Now, you're right, Daniel, but they'd just arrest an American tourist in Moscow, and we'd have to trade. No. All we want out of this deal is this hairy little fellow right here. What are you going to do with the monkey? Oh, he won't suffer. What do you mean? Well, we'll just, uh, put him to sleep. Oh. You're going to kill him. Well, it's national security. He knows too much. Huh. ♪ Doing, doing, doing ♪ Hey! Look, pinsky. That monkey's under arrest. He's my prisoner. This is a Soviet ship. That monkey belongs to my government! Hand him over. Amy! Hey, take it easy, young lady. Careful. Just calm down. [Zhukov] Be very careful. Give me the monkey. [Davis] Don't do anything foolish, young lady. Don't get excited. Please be calm. Just relax. [Muttering] Young lady... I appeal to you. Don't listen to him. Think of your country. Why think about your country, my dear? It does not think about you. Don't take another step, or I'll drop him. That's o.K. It's only a misdemeanor to drown a monkey. [Muttering] O.k. Just loosen up. Just loosen up. How can you even contemplate persecuting a poor, helpless, downtrodden creature like that monkey? Misdemeanor? Downtrodden creature? Oh, you're both such big phonies! Loosen up. Uh, o.K. O.k. You want to kill the monkey so you can blow up the world, and you want to save the monkey so you can blow up the world. Well, you're not going to exploit this poor, innocent little baby anymore. [Monkey whimpers] Save it. Save it! Hurry, comrades. Hurry! Save it! Save it! Hey, don't just stand there. You make sure that damn thing is drowned and bring me the evidence. Hey, quiet, you. Just be quiet. Pinsky, the finals. Damn! Lulu... Oh, Lulu. What? How come you won't go out with me?
