A legend appeared amongst the Lithuanian people. How the sea waves, came to bring forth golden valuables. Welcome son! Don’t welcome me mother! I did not catch one fish. It is okay son. It is like it is. Happiness matters the most. If we realy are lucky tonight, I will return with a full boat. And why do we need that much? We will have to make a sacrifice for the gods. I will bring a lot and the gods can wait. Why isn’t there any smoke? Your altar? Woman! We did not sacrifice anything Perkunas. Wait untill the next catch. So be it. Don’t go to sea today son. Don’t fear for me mother. Take with you this luck-belt. Thank you mother. How it sparkles. With mother tears I made it. Save it for the last moment. What’s with you Jurate? It is boring in my amber castle. If you listen to me Jurate. I will make you a song that you will want to dance on forever. The evening song must start. Perkunas is waiting. I already sang. I won’t sing anymore today. But how can you...? You are abolishing the ancient law. You are his bride. Who are you? You did not recognize me fisherman? Jurate. I am the immortal Jurate. The sea is my kingdom. And the fish are my servants. Free them at once. But I am a fisherman, Jurate. Without fish I cannot live. Besides you are immortal a nd will live forever. For this kind of disobedience I must punish you. But I'll have mercy. Let my fish go and take ...my necklace. You agree? I agree. And I'm going home with you. Pitiful man. How do you dare to touch my princess? I did not even know his name. And why should I care? I won’t think of him anymore. Oh White Sea eagles. Is my Kastytis alive? We don’t know. We cant see him. That’s the fisherman that plays such cheerful songs. Let's take him to the princess. What do you want? The amber diggers found the fisherman. Nanny.. Bring him back to life. His life is in your hands. Only your kiss can bring him back. Where am I? In the amber castle of queen Jurate. We weren't introduced properly. What is your name? Kastytis, my queen. Have a seat and tell me about the land. The land is not as pretty as here your highness. But it’s better there. It’s warmer. If you would be able to see how the waves sparkle on the afternoon sun. If you would be able to hear the sound of the trees... You would agree with me queen. And when I return my mother will be waiting for me on the shore. Mother.. Servants cheer him up.. So that he can forget about her. He forgot about the land. Oh white sea eagles. Have you seen my son Kastytis? We have. We have. His boat sunk. Oh cursed fate. I have no more faith left. It is time for the evening song. Jurate. What? What is that your singing? Stop. Am I here long? Yes you are. The sea eagles are shrieking of your mothers pain. And you are here dancing all the time. I should get back to the land. Alright. I will help you. Sit here. They will take you to land. But where is Jurate? She will come with me. She is chasing you away... You’ve been here too long. Bring him to the black doom and kill him. Why are we going down? I should be going to land. Down is land too. I will bury you there. Who composed that song? The Queen, this nanny, wants to kill the man. Quiet. A man. A man in my castle. Forgive me Perkunas… I love him. Than desecrated your castle will be. Come with me.. they are bringing him to the black doom. I must save him. Where is Kastytis? Kastytis. Show him the way and I.... You will stay here Jurate. No. I will go to the land. But on the land you will become mortal. Let it be so. It’s better to be mortal. I want to know how is it to be happy. Look the amber. That is all what Is left of my amber castle. Kastytis. mother My only son has returned to me. And not alone, I brought Jurate. Perkunas. Damn you Perkunas. I am stronger than you because she loves me. She is dead. Jurate. Jurate. Kastytis.
