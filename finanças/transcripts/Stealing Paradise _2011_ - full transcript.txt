- Amanda, it's getting late. Don't you ever call it quits? - I'm leaving soon. Propeller diameter in relation to static thrust. - Yeah. - Shouldn't you be working on the injection system? - I'm waiting on the wind-tunnel test results, so I thought I'd just do this for fun. - Fun? - What can I say? I'm an aeronautics- engineering nerd. - Yes, which is why you're the company's rising star. - Hmm. - Now, look, don't be alarmed. Howard wants to see you. - And he had to send a messenger? - Word of advice. Whatever's on his mind, don't react. Just listen. And don't be intimidated. - OK, now you're alarming me. - You'll be fine. - Just tell me, Brendan. Is it good or bad? - You're a terrific design engineer. You have nothing to worry about. - Where is everybody? - Went home, I guess. : Surprise! - I'm gonna kill you! - Happy birthday, Amanda. - Thank you. - Hey, birthday girl! - Hey! - So, which one is it? - Sixteen? - Thank you for the cake. - Our pleasure. I hope we get to celebrate many more together. - I hope so, too. Elise, let's get lunch tomorrow. - Definitely! But only if you let me buy. I didn't get you anything for your birthday. - Don't worry. And, Brendan, watch your back. Next practical joke is on me. - Can't wait! - Hey, beautiful! - Neil! What are you doing here? - I got off early. Why don't I drive us to the restaurant so the birthday girl can drink as much wine as she likes? - Ah. I like a man who thinks ahead. Neil! What did you do? Oh my goodness, this is so beautiful! I love it! - Especially when you put it on. - I love it. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Are you OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You seem a little pensive, I guess. - Ah, sorry. I've got a lot on my mind. - Why don't you let me take you home and distract you? Just what do you think you're doing? - Opening my present. - Your present? But it's not your birthday. - It will be. - Do you realize that you're gonna need to pay for this present? - How's my credit? - Hmm... It's holding up. ♪♪ Even without my eyes ♪ I can feel every move you make ♪ ♪ In my direction ♪ It's a new force of life ♪ That will bring us together ♪ Again ♪ You're a treasure ♪ A game to play ♪ There's a gloom ♪ Under the moon ♪ Upon your land ♪ And if you beg for my secret again ♪ ♪ You're an overwhelming ♪ Treasure coffin full of diamonds ♪ ♪ Full of jewels and full of passion ♪ ♪ Full of love ♪ - Damn! Where is it? - I got you another present. - Phoenix? - It's an amazing opportunity, Amanda. They're giving me the whole package. They're doubling my salary, stock options, profit participation. Everything. - That's great. I'm really happy for you, Neil. - Well, I was hoping you would be happy for us. - What do you mean? - I want you to come with me. - To Phoenix? - Yeah, to Phoenix. - Well, look, I mean, it's an amazing opportunity for you, but... all of my opportunities are here... with Lonsdale. I worked really hard to get where I am, and I can't just start all over. - Your career is that important to you? - So is yours. - No, you're right. It's not fair to ask you to give up your dream just so mine can come true. I guess... I just don't wanna lose you. - Phoenix isn't that far. - I'm so sorry. - It's OK. I mean, long-distance relationships have been known to work out. - Absolutely. And if it's meant to be, you guys will work it out. - Right. I mean, I hope so. I do really care about Neil. - Do you love him? - Of course. - Well, then that should be enough, no matter what the distance. - Yeah. Listen, can I ask you something? - What? - Is there anything going on between you and Brendan? - "Going on"? - You know what I mean. - Uh... Yeah. Something really great. - I'm glad for you, I guess, but you do understand that it's-- - I know, it's strictly against company policy. - Yeah, I mean you report to him. - Believe me, I know it's a risk. It's a firing offence. But... I think I'm in love with him. - How... How did this... - Just working together, spending time with each other. - Right. - I resisted it for a long time. But the attraction is so strong, for both of us. - Just try and be discreet, OK? Because if I picked up on it, odds are someone else will, too. - I know. Are you going to tell Howard? - Of course not. I can keep a secret. - Thanks. Thank you. - Thanks. No! OK, tell me you're here to apologize for forgetting my birthday. - Ah, right, sure, birthday. OK, I am officially the world's worst brother. - Not the whole world. Come in. - So, did you have a big party I wasn't invited to? - I guess there was a mini, like, work celebration, but I did go to dinner with Neil. - Oh. How is Neil? - Moving to Phoenix. - Wow! Misery loves company. - Why? What happed? - Rebecca threw me out. - Oh, Steven... - Yeah. I thought this marriage would work, but... - Is it salvageable? Can you guys go to counselling or anything? - She announced her intentions with divorce papers. - Oh. - This is where you tell me how much you hate Rebecca and how happy I should be to have her out of my life. - Actually, I really liked her. - Yeah, me too. Well, what can I say? I was a lousy husband. I mean, she wanted a soul mate, not a workaholic who's never home. I would have thrown me out, too. - So, where you staying? - It's just until I sort things out. - Of course. - Thanks, roomie. Mmm... Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna go freshen up. - Of course. I assume you remember where your old room is. - That's the great thing about you getting Mom and Dad's old place. It's just like coming home. Wow! This is exactly like your room when you were 8 years old. - Yeah. - You never change. You're still a little boy. - Ha-ha! - Dad would have loved this room. - Hey, wanna see something else Dad would have loved? There it is. That's my baby. That's 3 years' work right there. - What am I looking at here? - OK, you know how airplanes reverse thrust to slow down? - Yeah, it jolts me awake every time. - Well, there are several different ways to do it. Propeller with variable pitch. Then you've got your flat pitch. Then you've got your reverse thrust, where all of the forces are going in reverse. And then there are the shields, standard on jets, our clamshells, flower petals. But with my new shield design, I figured out a way to deflect the air through the turbines before it's burned up with fuel. It's called directed-flow thrust reverse. - I could pretend I know what you're talking about, but I have no idea. - All you need to know is that if my design works, and I think it will, it would be like adding 1,000 feet to any runway. - And your design does that? - In theory, yes. - Sounds pretty revolutionary. - Mmm. We'll see. I gotta build it first. - You know what? It's a good thing I got all the looks in this family, 'cause you definitely got the brains. So, what do you do with a design like this? - You wanna take a field trip? - Sure. - I'll show you. And I will buy you dinner after. - Ah, now you're talking! I hope it's not too far because I'm starving! - Don't worry, it's not very far. - So, where are we? - Criterion Aerospace. - Yeah? It looks like the Emerald City. - Well, for me, it is. Lonsdale is just a subsidiary of Criterion. If I do well there, this is my next stop. - Corporate? Why would you wanna go corporate? - Resources, access, prestige. I mean, put it this way: Working at Lonsdale, if I want money for an R&D project, I gotta sell it to Criterion first. And they could very well assign it to one of their other subsidiaries or appropriate it themselves. I wanna be at the top of the pyramid, not the bottom. Plus, we just design the parts. It's Criterion that makes the planes. Brilliant and power hungry. - Ah, I'm not there yet. I gotta pay my dues. - So, the shield design, is that the dues? - If I get it right. - So, how close are you? - Close. Come on. Let's get you some food. You look hungry. - You have no idea. - Let's go! - Hey! Welcome home! - Thank you. - How was Phoenix? - I'm very happy to be home. But if you mean the Neil part, um... it was difficult. It was painful. Honest... we are now officially just good friends. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. He loves it there. He loves his job. I mean, we talked about ways to make it work, but ultimately we both know it's time for us to move on. So it's OK. - Still sounds like you could use a glass of wine. - Yes, please. What is that? It smells amazing. - Ah! We have freshly ground Kobe beef... plum tomatoes picked before 10:30, black-forest mushrooms, Vidalia onions, kosher sea salt. - Remind me why Rebecca kicked you out again. Oh my God, it's Brendan! - Hey! What's he up to? - Let's find out. Oh, looks like he's made some sort of... It's my design. - What? - It's my design! How did he get my design? - Could he have come up with it on his own? - No! I spent 3 years and hundreds of hours on that. I mean, Brendan may have seniority over me, but I am a better engineer. - Well, the article says he developed it in house. - That's impossible. I would have known about it. - Did you work on it in your office? Is it possible he appropriated it there? - No, absolutely not. I know better than to do personal work at the office. - Then Brendan or someone must have hacked your computer. I'm not an expert, but I read the news. Computers can be hacked. - That's horrifying. He'll have applied for a patent by now. - No, pending. It's not the same thing. Why would he do this, Amanda? - I don't know. I mean, it's a major breakthrough. It's a career maker. But we're colleagues! You just don't screw over your colleagues! - Yeah, we do all the time. - What am I gonna do? - Start with the fact that you're smarter, or he wouldn't have had to steal it. He doesn't run the company? - No. - OK, who does? - Howard Lonsdale. - We'll demand a meeting with Lonsdale with Brendan present. We'll confront him, see how he reacts. - We? - Yeah, you need a lawyer, Amanda. - You can't. I mean, you have a new apartment to move into. You already have a full workload. I can't... - Look, my new apartment can wait, all right? I'm never so busy I can't help my sister out. I may forget birthdays, but I'm there for the stuff that matters. And I won't cost you a dime. - Thank you. - You kidding me? If somebody came after me, I hate to think what you'd do to them. Mr. Lonsdale, I'm Steven Collier. We spoke on the phone. - Pleasure to meet you. Amanda... Mr. Collier, Amanda, this is Kevin McNassy, Criterion's legal counsel. - Hi. - You must be Brendan Cavanaugh. - We can talk over here. Please, take a seat. - So, in summary, I have an exhaustive paper trail documenting the genesis of my design, the research supporting that development, and I have various stages of the work in progress dating back over 3 years. This is my design and mine alone. - Brendan? - I'm impressed. - How do you mean? - That you would go to such lengths to document something so insupportable. - So insupportable how? - When I first came up with the idea of a radically new shield-- - You did not come up with the idea! I did! - I did ask Amanda to help me with research, and she was helpful. - I was helpful? - Go on, Brendan. - Thank you. Like I was saying, she was helpful, to the limits of her skill set. But when it came down to the heavy lifting, I took over as senior engineer. Now, what she has just laid out for you is basically a work product she's preserved. A Lonsdale product. - Did anyone else work on this in-house design besides my client? - Yes. Elise Shayne. - Elise? - Mm-hmm. - She didn't mention anything to me. : Did you know about the project, Mr. Lonsdale? - Yes, as Mr. Cavanaugh was preparing to submit it for a publication. - But not until then? - No. But that's not unusual. Our senior engineers have free rein to develop pet projects. - What I don't understand, Mr. Cavanaugh, is if this is a Lonsdale project, how come there are no signs of it on any of my client's files on the Lonsdale server? - Aren't there? - You didn't. - Why don't we have a look? - Let's. You can remote access your terminal from here. - All of the projects that I work on from Lonsdale are on these files. And if Brendan wants to look by himself, he'll find no trace of my personal project here. Here. - I guess the simplest thing to do is search under "shield design." You're wasting your time. You're not gonna find anything. - We'll see soon enough, won't we? - I made sure never to work on the design at Lonsdale. - Here we go. This looks like the master folder. There you are. - I didn't put those files on there. He did. - We need to resolve this. - We will in court. In the meantime, my client's taking leave. Let's collect your things. We're leaving. - Hey, Brendan, if this is your design, have you told them about the flaw? - What flaw? - Because there were no patents back then, da Vinci would sometimes protect his work by inserting a flaw into the design. So if someone stole it, the executed design would fail. I put a flaw in the design. Have you found it yet? If Criterion goes ahead with the design as it stands, you'll spend a fortune on engines that don't work. And you might even crash a few planes in the process. Gentlemen. - Hey! What's going on? - Did you do some work for Brendan on a new shield design? - Yeah. - Did he tell you it was his idea? - I don't remember. I just assumed. Why? What's the matter? - Don't trust him, Elise. Don't trust him. - So, is there really a flaw in the design? - Brendan... What's going on? Why is Amanda so upset? - We'll talk about it later. - Could she be telling the truth? - I don't know. She's a stellar engineer. But then again, so is Brendan. - Well, if she is and there's a flaw in that design, we got a big problem. - I know. - I'll advise Mr. Broderick to have the senior engineering team vetting that design ASAP. - Absolutely. - Once she settles down, let's get her in here. If it is her design, we gotta cut a deal. - I just... I cannot let Brendan get away with this! I mean, how can he live with himself? Thank you. - You rationalize or you deny. In the public defender's office, we see this all the time: rapists who blame the victim, murderers who are convinced they didn't do it. I've seen a lot of bad people, Amanda. And Brendan is right up there with them. - Well, they're not gonna give up. So what's our next move? - I get started filing a suit against Criterion in the morning, but the burden of proof is on them. With the evidence we showed, I doubt they wanna go to court. - What'll they want? - My guess is, they'll make you an offer to make this go away quickly. - I don't care what they offer! It's my design! And I'll be damned if Brendan gets one iota of credit! - That's what I wanted to hear. - My office... Oh my God... The hard drives! - Tell me you have a backup. - The backup was in here. - Yeah. - No, it's OK. Everything is stored on a secure web site. - We need to keep your documents in a safe place. - I'm gonna go talk to him. - Who? - Brendan. - That is not a good idea. - He can't get away with this! - I'm telling you, don't do this! You'll compromise the lawsuit. - Try and stop me. - Amanda! - What do you want? - You broke into my house! - Calm down! - Calm down. This is what I look like when I am calm. You do not want to see me mad! - What do you want? - I wanna know why you stole from me. I wanna know why you were lying to Howard! - Who do you think you are? You're a junior member of the team. I hired you right out of school. See, we're a collective. We work together. And you had the arrogance to develop something on your own? - Thank you. Thank you for admitting that I developed this! It is perfect! It is special! It is beautiful! It will revolutionize the industry and I did it! - I taught you everything. - Like hell you did! - I probably suggested the idea! - You're delusional. - I deserve to have done this. - But you didn't, and you know that! - Well, if you won't come to terms with the company, you're gonna have to prove that in court. - Don't worry. I will. - You wanna play the victim, go ahead. Nobody's gonna take you seriously! - Hey, I was just about to go looking. - Here, whoa, whoa, whoa. Let me do that. I'm an expert. - I reported the burglary. - Ah, thank you. - So, how did it go with Brendan? - I think it went great. - Yeah? - He pretty much admitted to stealing my design, which I already knew, but I still think it was worth it. You can say it. - Say what? - "I told you so." You said it yourself. My going over there wasn't gonna accomplish anything. - I'm your lawyer. It's my job to protect you, even if it's from yourself. But I have seen that look on your face before. I knew there was no away I was gonna stop you. - I didn't do this for the money. I didn't do this for the recognition! I did this because Dad never got a chance to see what I've become! I just wanted to create something that would make him proud of me. I did this for him. And now everyone is accusing me of trying to take credit for someone else's idea? I need to sleep. - Hold on. - Detective Usher. - Sanders. What do we have? Approximate time of death? - Pending confirmation, early last night. - I count 4 bullet wounds. - Yeah, 4 casings were found by the door. .45 calibre. Shot at close range. - So, who was he? - A Brendan Cavanaugh. He was an aeronautical engineer. - He live alone? - Yeah, but he had a girlfriend who stayed over occasionally. - Who found the body? - Neighbour across the hall. Cavanaugh's door was open when he was leaving. - He know the girlfriend? - No, not by name. He's only seen her. - Any sign of a struggle? - No. No sign of forced entry. Nothing in the apartment appears to have been disturbed. - So, maybe he was ambushed opening the door to somebody. - Looks that way. - Somebody he knew. - Brendan was with the firm for 10 years. He was an exemplary employee, and a friend. - We're sorry. - The evidence indicates Mr. Cavanaugh may have known his assailant. - Oh? - We understand he was in a relationship. Do you know who she is? - No. Brendan's private life was... Well, it--it was private. - Did Mr. Cavanaugh have any enemies? Anyone who may have wished him harm? - No, not really. - Not really? - Well, a situation has developed at the firm between Brendan and another employee. - What kind of situation? - A dispute over authorship of a design. - A dispute? - The employee claims that Brendan stole a design from her. - How serious is this situation? - Extremely. The patent on this design is potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars. - Ms. Collier? - Yes. Can I help you? - I'm Detective Usher. This is Detective Sanders. May we speak with you? - Uh, yes, of course. Please, come in. - Is, um... Is everything all right? - I'm sorry to inform you, Ms. Collier, but a colleague of yours was murdered last night. - Murdered? - Who? - I'm sorry, you are? - I'm Steven Collier. Her brother. - Steven, these are Detectives Usher and Sanders. - Who was murdered? - Brendan Cavanaugh. - Oh my God! Um... please, sit down. Now, did you say last night? Because I saw him last night at about 7:00. - Saw him where? - At his apartment. - Amanda... - What were you doing at his apartment? - He had misappropriated one of my designs and claimed it as his own. - As Ms. Collier's attorney, I'm advising her not to say anything. - I thought you were her brother. - I'm both. - I have nothing to hide. - You said you saw him around 7:00. How long were you there? - A couple of minutes. - Was he alone? - Yes, I believe so. - Where'd you go after that? - Back here. - I can confirm that. - And how about you, Mr. Collier? Did you go to Mr. Cavanaugh's apartment last night? - To his apartment? No? - Ms. Collier, do you own a firearm? - Yes, actually, I do. - Is it here? - Yes. It's in the other room. Um... please. It's just in there, in a gun box. It was our father's. I inherited it along with the house. Where is it? - There was a break-in yesterday. I reported it. - You reported the gun as being stolen? - No, because we didn't know that it was. - What kind of gun was it? - A .45. - What else was taken? - All my computer hard drives and the backups. - Was this before or after you saw Mr. Cavanaugh? - Before. I thought Brendan might have been the one to break in and steal them. That's why I went to is apartment, to confront him. - I'm advising my client not to answer any more questions. - OK, but this is an ongoing investigation. Don't leave town, either of you. - Do you mind if I take this? - Not without a warrant. - OK. Oh, one more thing. Mr. Cavanaugh was seeing someone, a woman. Do you know who? - You know, I said no more questions. Let's go. - Do you remember when I went to my junior prom with Dave Miller? - How could I forget? I still think you should have let me kick his ass. - Yeah, he was a jerk, but he was also your friend, so... Do you remember what you said to me when you drove me home? - Something deep and meaningful, I imagine. - You said that it didn't matter who he was. What mattered was that I was your sister and that you would protect me, no matter what the cost. - What are you getting at? - Did you go out last night after I went to bed? - Are you asking me if I killed Brendan? - No, I'm not. Are you gonna ask me if I killed him? - No, I'm your attorney. I don't ask questions like that. - I didn't. - I know that. I'm also your brother. I know I don't need to ask a question like that. - I'm sorry. - No... - I don't know where my mind is. - Direct-flow thrust reverse? - We talked to some aeronautics experts. Apparently, it's a major advance in design. - And worth millions. - Even though, technically, the design is work for hire, it's not uncommon for the engineer of record to be awarded a portion of the royalties. - Ms. Collier claims the design is hers alone and was planning on suing Cavanaugh over authorship. - So, we have a motive. - Twenty-nine, single, undergrad and post-grad from MIT, where she studied aerodynamics, materials science, avionics and propulsion. - And her academic record? - Top of her class. - From MIT? That's Impressive. - She went straight to work at Lonsdale Aeronautics. Cavanaugh recruited her. - OK, so, we have a reason to suspect that the victim knew his killer. And the number of bullets fired at such a close proximity indicates a strong emotional connection with the victim. It's either love or hate. Ms. Collier had motive. - And admits to seeing him the night of the murder. - But he was in a relationship. And until we find out the identity, we should never rule them out as a suspect. And we have no murder weapon. - Not yet. - Keep looking. - Mr. Collier isn't joining us? - He had to be in court, so I'll be recording the conversation. - Of course. I would have advised the same. - How are you, Amanda? - I've been better. - Yes. Brendan's death. I still can't believe it. - What did you wanna talk to me about, Howard? - It broke my heart to see you and Brendan lock horns over that design. - Hmm... - I like to think of Lonsdale Aeronautics as a big family. And why not? It bears my name. - I agree. That's why I was so devastated by what Brendan did. - Yes, but.... And I know how this is going to sound. So be it. Now that Brendan's gone, I was hoping we could come to a mutually satisfactory agreement with respect to the design. - What kind of agreement? - Criterion is prepared to offer you co-credit on the design. - Co-credit? - With Mr. Cavanaugh. - Why not give me full credit? - Because Mr. Cavanaugh is on record as having submitted the design. It complicates things legally. - So, I would effectively be giving away half ownership of something that I created. - Yes, but you would still profit handsomely, and we could put all of this behind us. - You mean Criterion and Lonsdale could avoid the negative publicity of a protracted and potentially ugly lawsuit? - I protect corporate interests. That's my job. - Well, then there's the issue of the flaw. Criterion's engineers... I assume you've put them on it. Have they found it yet? - No. - All right, so let's be crystal clear about what we're talking about here. You are not eager to bring me back on because it's the right thing to do, but because you need me. If you're interested, as you say, in putting all of this behind us, then credit me, and me alone, with what I rightfully created. You're a lawyer. If there are legal complications with Brendan's submission, un-complicate them. And then when you've done that, let me know. And then we can discuss terminating the lawsuit and bringing me back on board. Good seeing you, Howard. Elise... Come here. How are you doing? How do you think? - I'm so sorry about Brendan. - Who would do something like this? - I don't know. - Would you? - Elise, of course not! - I'm sorry, OK? I just... I don't know what to do. - Are the police still questioning you? - The police? - Do you mean they don't know that you and Brendan were together? - No! No, and neither does anyone else! Please don't tell. - Elise... - Please... - Welcome back, sir. How was your flight? - Never mind that. Where are we with the shield design? - Amanda Collier's not cooperating, so we're facing a lawsuit. - Who's her lawyer? - Her brother. Steven Collier. He's a public defender. - What's his reputation? - He's tough, tenacious. His clientele tend to be pretty hard core. Apparently, he does well by them. - Does he have any experience in civil litigation? - None that I'm aware of. - Well, he's gonna have to rely on tough and tenacious. And about the alleged flaw, is she telling the truth? - Well, we're trying to find out. - If she sues, the litigation could take months, years, during which time we lose out on implementing a revolutionary new design. - We could countersue, force her to reveal it. - Which would implicitly acknowledge that it's her design. - Right. - Let's keep the conversation open and hope she comes around. - We caught a break. - Where? - In the alley behind Cavanaugh's building. - We went through that alley with a fine-tooth comb. - We took another look and found it. - Tell me it's got a serial number. - Hey... I brought you some tea. - Thanks. - You know, you should take a break. - No, not now. This is all I've ever wanted. I mean, really, ever since I was a little girl. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, he overshot the runway. If he had just been able to slow the plane down by a few knots... You expecting company? - Not me. - Detective Usher! Open the door! - Amanda Collier, you're under arrest for the murder of Brendan Cavanaugh. - Whoa, hold on a minute! - You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used... - Don't say a word. I'm right behind you, Amanda! - If you can't afford an attorney, one will by appointed... - Steven Collier for the defence, Your Honour. My client pleads not guilty. Since she has no prior arrests, is established in the community and poses no flight risk, we request bail. - Collier. Any relation? - Yes, she's my sister, Your Honour. - I see. What's the people's position? - This was a particularly brutal murder. The prosecution has overwhelming evidence linking the accused. Given the severity of the crime, the State requests remand. - Bail is set at $500,000. - You'll have to put up the house, but you're free. So, they've got motive, opportunity, a murder weapon registered in your name with your fingerprints on it. - But no witnesses. And you can confirm that I was home before Brendan was murdered. - Time of death, like any scientific evidence, is open to interpretation. A good prosecutor, and Ainsworth's a damn good prosecutor, will find an expert testify it was earlier, exactly when you claimed to have been at Cavanaugh's apartment. Besides, as your brother and your attorney, my testimony is suspect. Ainsworth will do everything to compromise it. - Somebody's framing me. - I know that. - But who? And why? - Well, whoever actually killed him. - Can we win this? - I like to think that truth always prevails. - But it doesn't, does it? - Narcissistic rage. Now, a prosecution witness is gonna explain this to you better than I can, but this essentially can occur when pride... ego... and an exalted view of oneself replaces all decency and morality. Now, the prosecution will prove that Amanda Collier, in a narcissistic rage, murdered Brendan Cavanaugh with malice aforethought. - Opportunity? Perhaps. I have the opportunity right now to pour this water into Mr. Ainsworth's lap. Now... that doesn't mean I'm going to. The murder weapon... Ballistic tests have established the exhibit you will be shown, a .45-calibre handgun, was the one used in the murder. We won't contest that or the fact that my client's fingerprints are on it, because of course, they would be. She owns it... legally. What the prosecution cannot prove, however, is that the defendant fired that gun on the night in question. Because she didn't. And you've already heard what the prosecution will present in terms of motivation. - Narcissism is a personality disorder stemming from pride. Narcissistic rage can occur when something or someone frustrates or prevents an individual from realizing his ambitions. The design in question was conceived with a specific goal in mind: to impress, to gain attention, to outshine one's peers. - And if someone were to erase this achievement, if someone claimed they created it themselves, if someone claimed all the rewards-- - Objection! Counsel is leading the witness... all over the place. - Sustained. - He would have stolen everything: her past, her future, her best work, her life's dream. - Consequences? - Objection! Calls for a conclusion by the witness. - Sustained. - Could they have been fatal? - Objection! - Sustained. Mr. Ainsworth... - No more questions, Your Honour. - Your witness, Mr. Collier. - Have you ever been robbed, doctor? - Excuse me? - Have you ever been robbed? - I was mugged once. - Did you kill the guy? - Of course not! I don't carry a weapon. - If you had carried a weapon, would you have used it to kill him? - For that amount of money? No, of course not. - Well, how much then? - What? - How much would he have to take from you before you'd kill him? What's your tipping point? - I have no idea. - Really? Because you told this court what my client's tipping point was. How well do you know the defendant? - I interviewed her in preparation for trial. - For how long? - An hour or so, which is customary. I also reviewed the police reports. - Wow! That's impressive. Then again, you are a board-certified psychiatrist with an extensive list of credentials. How many times have you testified in court, doctor? - I don't know. Numerous times. - Well, more than 20? - Yes. - Fifty? - Possibly. Probably. - And always on the issue of narcissistic rage? - No, on a variety of psychiatric issues. - In other words, whatever the lawyer who hires you needs you to help prove. - Objection! - Sustained! - When you interviewed the defendant, did she say she killed Brendan Cavanaugh? - No! - Did she say she wanted to? - I didn't ask her that. - Well, what did you ask her? - I used a psychiatric diagnostic questionnaire, which is industry recognized. - But you didn't ask her if she killed Brendan Cavanaugh. Or even if she wanted to. - No! - How can you say what her tipping point is? You don't even know your own. Maybe you've never taken the diagnostic questionnaire! - Objection! - No more questions. - So, you're pretty good at this. - Don't sound so surprised. - So, that's good for us, right? - It can't hurt. - Where are we going? - My office. I finished drawing up the litigation papers against Criterion. I gotta pick them up so I can serve them today. - OK. Did he get my handwritten notes? - No, those are stored in a safety-deposit box, but I'm sure that's what he was after. - We gotta report this. - Later. I gotta get to Criterion to serve them with the lawsuit. I'll see you back at the house. - I'm sorry. - Amanda Collier? - Do I know you? - My name is Mason Cavanaugh. - Cavanaugh... - Brendan was my brother. And I know you killed him. - I didn't. I didn't. - Your brother's pretty good at what he does in there. Maybe he's fooling the jury, but he won't fool me. There are many, many ways that justice can be served. I'll be watching you, both of you. - Hey, you've reached Steven. Leave me a message, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Steve, it's me. Call me as soon as you get this. There you are! - Hey. Sorry, my cell was off. I got your message. So, the papers are served. Criterion is officially sued. What's up? - OK, listen, it turns out Brendan had a brother. He's been attending the trial. And after I left you this afternoon, he confronted me. - What do you mean, confronted you? - The "I know you killed my brother "and I'm keeping an eye on you" kind of confronted me. - Think it's the same guy who broke into my office? - I don't know. - Point him out to me. I'll make sure the bailiff watches him. - OK. - All right, I'll see you soon. Bye. - Thanks for calling. - Dispatch said this guy was part of your investigation. - You think this accident is somehow connected to the trial? - This wasn't an accident. You see any skid marks? - No. - Whoever cut him off accelerated to the point of impact from behind the bush. - Then fled the scene. - Thank you. Ms. Collier... Sorry to bother you. - It's fine. - How's he doing? - The doctors say he's gonna be all right. He has a broken ankle and a concussion but no internal injuries, thank God. - Well, he was lucky. - He was. What are you two doing here? - Our preliminary investigation indicates this wasn't an accident. - Someone deliberately ran in front of him. - What? Who? - Well, we thought you might know that. - I mean, he represents a lot of dangerous people, but he's on their side. - Their victims aren't. - We'll need his case files. - Sure. Wait, no. There was someone, yesterday at the trial. His name is Mason Cavanaugh. He's Brendan's brother. He threatened me. - Did you report that to the bailiff? - Steve was gonna do that today. - How did he threaten you? - He said that maybe Steven was fooling the jury, but he wasn't convincing him. But why would he wanna kill him? - To prevent him from representing you in court? - Well, we'll look into that. - If you think of anyone else, give us a call. - Ah, thank you for coming. - Of course. - I've been so selfish, so obsessed with hiding my relationship with Brendan. I am so ashamed of myself. - I understand. You didn't wanna lose your job. - It's not just that. I was here, Amanda, alone... the night that Brendan was murdered. I have no alibi. My prints, my DNA, they're all over his apartment. I'm the potentially jilted girlfriend. I'm your reasonable doubt. I could have been helping you. - Listen, I haven't exactly been a saint, either. I told Steven about you and Brendan. And he is going to be calling on you to testify as a witness. - Of course you did. You're facing life in prison. But that's not the worst of it. - What? - Brendan had a partner. - A partner in what? - The design. Or rather, the patent. - I don't understand. - He had no intention of sharing the profits with Criterion. Even before that article appeared, he'd already secured a patent. And somebody was helping him. - Who? - I don't know. Obviously someone from outside the company. - OK, so why do I need to know this? - I think that Brendan was planning to cheat the partner, to cut him or her out of the deal. One night, I was over at Brendan's place, and I woke up in the middle of the night and he wasn't in bed beside me. - I understand, but sole credit is strategic. - I couldn't make out exactly what they were saying, but he was defending himself. Something about "Sole credit is strategic" and "We'll sort it out later." - Yeah... - Clearly, whoever he was talking to was mad, really mad. - Yeah... - And then a few nights later, he was murdered. - OK, so you think that it could have been this partner who murdered Brendan. - It's possible. - You need to tell the police. - I wanted to tell you first, in case it might help Steven defend you. I should have told you a long time ago. Can you ever forgive me? - Of course, Elise. - Thank you. - Detective Usher. - Detective Usher, this is Amanda Collier. - Ms. Collier, what can I do for you? - I think I'm being followed. - Where are you? - Um... I'm downtown. I am near the Prudential Center. - And where are you headed? - Home. - All right, just keep driving. Don't do anything to arouse suspicion. I've got you covered. - OK, thank you. - Step out of the car and keep your hands where I can see them! Turn around. Put your hands on top of the car. Spread. So, Mason Cavanaugh, Milwaukee P.D., what are you doing in Boston? Call us next time. - Sure. - OK. - Well? - He's a beat cop in Milwaukee. He's licensed to carry a concealed weapon. - OK, so why is he stalking me? - He says he's not, just keeping an eye on you. There's no damage on his car, Ms. Collier, and he's got an airtight alibi as to where he was at the time of the attack on Steven. - Yeah? Where? - Having a drink with one of our officers. They were at the academy together. - OK, so why is it legal for him to follow me, to spy on me? - It's a grey area. We've advised him to keep his distance. - But you won't arrest him because he's one of your own. - Ms. Collier... Amanda, I know you're going through a lot right now. But did it ever occur to you that he is, too? His brother was murdered. Look, I'm not the enemy, just someone like you trying to get at the truth. Do you mind telling me what you were doing near the Prudential Center tonight? - I was visiting a friend, Elise Shayne. - Elise Shayne? - Yes. She also works for Lonsdale, and she has some information she needs to share with you. - Ah... - What? - I got a text from the precinct when I was questioning Cavanaugh. I have some bad news. - Usher... I found this just here. - Oh... That could have been there a while. - Or it could have fallen off before she jumped. - I don't think she jumped. The signs are subtle, but I think she was dragged out here. - I'll go tell Forensics to take a closer look. - Ms. Collier, Detective Usher. Tell me something. When your house was broken into, was any jewellery taken? - OK, I need you to get in here and double-check the door. - Mmm. OK. Did I pass? - You'll live. - Anything else I can get for you, Mr. Collier? - That depends on what you're doing after your shift. - We'll talk about it later. - OK. - So, did you get her number? - Not wet, but I will. - So, I take it you're feeling better. - I don't remember much of what happened, but they tell me I'm pretty lucky. - Yeah, you fared a lot better than your bike. - It's time I got a new one. OK, something else happened. What? - Elise died last night. - Oh... - She went off her balcony. I was with her half an hour before it happened. - Oh, Amanda, I'm so... Was she depressed? - No. I mean, she was upset. She was very upset. But I don't think she'd kill herself, and neither do the police. They think that she was murdered. And they found an earring of mine right near the balcony. - So, are they charging you with another murder? - No, it's actually kind of the opposite of that, 'cause I was with the police when it happened. - You were what? - It's a long story. Basically they are going to be recommending to Ainsworth that murder charges against me are dropped. - OK, so is he buying it? - We'll see. - We can't give him time to change his mind. We have to get a hearing as soon as possible. - Not until you get out of here. - No, that could be days! - It doesn't matter. The trial is stayed anyway until you recover. - No, we have to do this now. Do you have your mini recorder? - Yeah. - I'm gonna dictate a motion to dismiss. In the meantime, you need to bring me up to speed. OK. Right. Mr. Ainsworth? - I appreciate that the detectives have formed an opinion as to the facts surrounding the death of Elise Shayne, but they are unrelated to this case. - That's not true, Your Honour. It is the same attempt to cast suspicion on me for a crime that I did not commit. - As you say in your motion papers. - I believe she had evidence that supported my defence. - Hearsay evidence that is as of yet unknown to the prosecution. - I think Elise was killed so she wouldn't testify. I believe it was the same person who tried to kill my brother. - That is an awfully convenient bit of fiction. - And that remark is inappropriate, Mr. Ainsworth. It's hardly fanciful to conjecture that there may be some connection between an assault on Ms. Collier's lawyer, the suspicious death of a scheduled witness and the facts in this case. However, that connection is unknown to us at this time, and until it is, it is my judgment that the trial continue, pending the ability of Ms. Collier's attorney to return to court. Thank you. - Hey! Why are you doing this? - Excuse me? - My arresting officers think I'm innocent. Why don't you? - The facts in the case tell me you're guilty. - Well, then we'll prove you wrong. - We'll see. - To Rose. - Who? - Mmm... Rose is the angel who took care of me at the hospital. She's wanted to be a nurse her entire life. She's never been married. She thinks I am the most fascinating man she's ever met. And when I can drive again, we're gonna meet for coffee. - It's funny how fate works, isn't it? I mean that you might have to write a "thank you" note to whoever ran you off the road. Indeed! - To Dad. - To Dad. Now... let's get back in court. Were you present, Mr. McNassy, when Ms. Collier confronted Mr. Cavanaugh? - Yes, in the law offices of Howard Lonsdale. - In what capacity were you there? - As Criterion's legal representative. - The parent company of Lonsdale. - Yes, that's right. - Can you describe that meeting? - I'd say it was heated. Ms. Collier was adamant that the design was her creation, and she accused Mr. Cavanaugh of stealing it. - Did you form an opinion as to the merit of her accusation? - No, but-- - Objection! The witness's opinion is irrelevant. - Overruled. - But what? - Mr. Cavanaugh's claims of authorship were not entirely convincing. - In what way? - Ms. Collier had exhaustive handwritten documentation outlining her history of work on the project. Mr. Cavanaugh had copies but none of it in his files. - You're aware that any work done at Lonsdale is Lonsdale property. - Yes, I am. - Right, of course. You're in-house counsel. So, even if Ms. Collier had done preliminary work, even extensive preliminary work, Mr. Cavanaugh, as senior engineer, would have a right to claim authorship. - Yes, but that doesn't explain the lack of documentation, which is why, at a later meeting, Criterion offered Ms. Collier co-credit on it. - Did she take that offer? - She did not. - Did she give a reason? - She said it was her work. She saw no reason to share credit. - Now, on the day in question, you said the meeting was heated at times. Did Ms. Collier at any time threaten the deceased? - Only with a lawsuit. - Right, she didn't say anything like: "You'll pay for this" or "I could kill you for--" - Objection! - Sustained. - Did Ms. Collier threaten Mr. Cavanaugh with anything other then a lawsuit? - No. - That's all, Your Honour. - Let's go. I'm gonna catch him. Mr. McNassy, would you mind if I talk to you for a minute? I was hoping to ask your advice on something, maybe get your help, if you'd be willing. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Certainly. But I am late for an appointment right now, so... give me a call later. - Of course. - After 7:00. - Is there any chance you'd be willing to meet up in person? It's delicate. - OK. - Um, do you know Dunphy's in South Boston? - I know Dunphy's. 7:30? - Perfect. - All right. - Ah! Can't wait to start cooking again. - Yeah, you and me both. I'm gonna go, but I shouldn't be too late. - Call me if he comes up with anything. - Will do. Thank you. - Ah! - Mr. McNassy... - Hey, listen, I think I'm gonna have to postpone our meeting. You're not gonna believe it, but my car broke down. - Oh no, what happened? - Ah, I think it's a broken belt. I called a tow truck. They said it's gonna be an hour, maybe two. - Um, where are you? - Right at the entrance to Franklin Park. - Oh, that's not far. Why don't I just meet you there? - You sure? - Absolutely. I'll keep you company while you wait. - All right, thanks. I'll be here. I'll see you soon. Thanks for coming. - I should be thanking you. - For what? - Well, first of all, for your testimony. - I swore to tell the truth. That's what I did. - Thank you for meeting me. - So, how can I help? - I saw Elise Shayne the night that she died. - Poor woman. I understand she took her own life. - That hasn't actually been confirmed yet. - Really? - This hasn't come out yet, but she was Brendan Cavanaugh's lover. - Oh no! - Yes. She knew that Brendan had stolen my idea. And she told me that he had a partner in doing so. - Brendan had someone help steal the design? - No, but he had someone working with him to exploit it, to secure the appropriate patents. - Ah, OK. - So, anyway, what I'm thinking is, aeronautical engineering is such small world. What I'm hopping is that maybe you know some of the people who could help a person get such a patent. - Well, I probably know most of those people. - So, we were wondering if you could help us find out who it might have been. - You tell the police about this? - Yes, and they are looking into it. But we were really hoping to find out for the sake of my criminal defence. - I see. First thing the police are gonna do is go over his email accounts, cell phone records to see if he tried to communicate with a partner. - Right. I think they're doing that already. - But a smart partner is gonna use untraceable accounts. - Oh, that could be, but, I mean, that would really be thinking ahead, no? - The stakes are so high, the financial rewards are so substantial, you're gonna wanna protect your position, particularly with a partner as devious as Cavanaugh, with a girlfriend as pathetically neurotic as Elise. Oh, it's a good thing I did, because sure enough, Brendan tried to cheat me out of my share. Then Elise couldn't keep her mouth shut. - What? - Let's take a walk. - What are you doing! Ah! - If you raise your voice again, I will kill you. You work your whole life with a company. And then when it comes time to be made an equity partner, to finally share in the vast rewards you've helped amass for your corporate family, it doesn't happen! "Business policy has changed. "In the new austerity, "equity partnerships are frozen." - But why do this? - The only way to make serious money is to own a killer patent. When Brendan told me what he suspected you were developing on the side, it was my idea to steal it. - Just put the gun away! - I got him the patent. Then the maggot did what I feared he would do: took all the credit and tried to cut me out! He thought he had me by the short hairs. - Just put the gun away. - I couldn't call him out. I'd expose myself. That would have meant the end of my career. He was right. He figured he could throw me a bone and I'd just go away. But you know what? I was tired of bones. With him out of the way and you in prison, I figured I would have plenty of time to figure out how to secure the patent and enjoy the rewards because I am very good at what I do. But you had to put up a fight. Huh? Even when I offered to cut you in. Half a fortune wasn't enough. You needed it all. - OK, let's just make a deal now. - You put a flaw in the design, which Criterion may never find, which means my patent might be worthless. You know what, Amanda? I think you're the flaw. See, that's a problem that is very, very easy to fix. Ahh! - Ahh! - That was for Brendan. - Ah! - It's OK, Ms. Collier. I won't hurt you. - Milwaukee cops are tough. Takes more than a two-by-four to keep 'em down. - Thank you. So, how did he find me? - He put a tracking device on the underside of your car days ago. That's actionable. Would you like to press charges? - I think I'll let it go. - He heard enough of what McNassy said to know he killed his brother, but not much else. He said he'll do what he can when you call him as a witness, but there'll be a lot of "I don't know" and "I didn't hear that," which Ainsworth will no doubt exploit. - Well, I'm not too worried about it, 'cause it's all on here. I'm a little over cautious myself. - As you know, Amanda, the patent Brendan Cavanaugh secured for his alleged direct-flow thrust-reverse design was part of his estate, and that estate passed to Mason Cavanaugh. We have a letter from Mr. Cavanaugh in which he asserts that his brother's claim of authorship for that design is totally baseless. He uses more colourful language than that. - I don't think I have ever seen words like that in a formal letter. - No, it's a first for us, too. As you can see, he asks... well, demands... that we assign sole authorship of that design to Amanda. - Which we've done. You'll need to review that, of course, Mr. Collier, but we believe that you will find the profit-participation terms to be, by any comparable industry standards, exceedingly generous. - Of course, I did develop the design offsite, Mr. Broderick, so I may very well decide to take the design elsewhere. - Well, we understand that, which is why, as an inducement for you to sign that agreement, Criterion would like to offer you an equity partnership. - I thought that the equity partnerships were frozen. - Not for everyone, and certainly not for engineers whose visionary ideas will make our company a great deal of money. - We'll take that under advisement and get back to you. - We will, of course, need you to correct that design flaw. - Of course. - We'll keep in touch. - Malcolm. - Ah... - Not that it makes much difference at this point, but tell me the truth, Amanda. Was there really a flaw in the design? We'll be in touch! You know I don't care what anyone says about lawyers. I think you're pretty great. So, should we go celebrate or head straight home? - Actually, I got somebody coming to pick me up, so... - No... - Mm-hmm. She's gonna take me apartment hunting. That woman doesn't know it yet, but I am gonna ask her to marry me. - Are you sure that's a good idea? - No, I'm sure that's a terrible idea. But why should I let that stop me? - Well, if she doesn't say yes, I think she's a damn fool! - Bye. - Mmm! Thank you. But, Steven, you're in a cast! I mean... - It's like I've always said: I got the looks in this family, but you got the brains. - We're going to the Emerald City, Dad.
