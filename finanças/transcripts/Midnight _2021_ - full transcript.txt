IF SHE'S YOUR SISTER, SHE COULD BE HURT. Hurt? Where is it? Where is my sister? [Kyung Mi crying] Where is she? Tell me! Come with me, please. Don't go. But she must've bled a lot. Then I'll go with you. With me? [sighing] Thank you. [sighing exasperated] [police siren] Fuck, I was so close. Now, we don't have to worry. I hope she's fine. Nothing but a bike and the trash.

I'm not lying. You believe me, don't you? [Do Shik humming] Have you noticed this man keeps glancing at us? It's because he doesn't understand us. You know his sister is involved. He was devastated moments ago, but he's so calm now. She is not my sister. N-O-T M-Y S-I-S-T-E-R. [ominous music] Just got her message. Must've missed each other. He found her. Yes, I'm relieved now. [elevator door opening] Yellow blouse, denim shorts. White heels. Then where is she now? You don't know? And the man was wearing a cap and a mask? Then you didn't see his face? Gosh. Anything else you remember? How tall or... how big he was... I can answer that. He was about 170 cm tall and very slender... Sir, I'll get your statement later. Please wait. You're not supposed to interrupt other's statement. Yes, I'm sorry. [Drunk Man] Hey! Who do you think you are, interrupting like that? Mr. Cop will take care of everything. - Ruthless prick. - Sir. Don't pick a fight. Stay still! You think you're so smart? Sir. I heard you, so stop. How dare you stare like that when the elderly talks? Please, sir. Did your parents raise you this way? - Sir! - Bastard. [Policeman] Just go home if you sobered up. I feel sorry for your parents... We won't let you in if you behave like this. Behave, moron.

If your brother meets me, I will kill him, too! [Do Shik coughing in pain] [Jong Tak] Tell me! Where is my sister? Where is she? Don't get worked up. It will only make her die sooner. What is it?

He is a witness, witness! No, he is that bastard! I understand you are worried about your sister. But you shouldn't do this. No! He is that son of a bitch! Please help me! I can hardly breathe. You fucking bastard! [Jong Tak grunting in pain] Are you alright? What's all this about? What happened?

My... my sister. My sister... I told you not to get worked up. [Policeman] Sir. Are you sure you're okay? Yes, I am. I just feel a little dizzy. What is going on? I don't know. Sorry about that. You were just being nice. He must be worried about his sister. I understand. Let's not make a big deal of it. Would it be alright, sir? Thank you so much. It's okay, he is not hurt. You can be assured. [Kyung Mi trying to speak] He's fine, really. No need to worry. Sir! Please take care. Good night. Yes, he's alright. I've just told you we checked everything! Please, I ask you. Alright. We are so sorry. Only if you had told us... I kept telling you that bastard is the one! Yes, you did but... how could we believe you when you're brandishing a knife?
