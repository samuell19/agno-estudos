Hmmm. So you think you've seen it all, right? Until the moment when you realize you've seen nothing. Absolutely nothing. And I am not talking about seeing through your eyes, but through your soul. You think you know everything, right? Until? Exactly. Until the moment you realize you don't know anything. So let me tell you something. Millions of children are going missing every year around the world. Half a million in the United States alone. Yes, half... a... million. And they all have a story, but this one is special to me, because this is the story of my child. My name is Michael Watson and my daughter went missing. I was doing good, I mean I'm... I'm trying stay on my path. But last week, I got this paper from the hospital that made me very angry. It's like they all forgot that he died in their hands... in their hands. This is their fault, okay? Ayi-yai-yai. - What am I doing here? - And now they come after me. With what money? From where should I pay? - It's just me now. - Marcy? Marcy, are you talking from a place of anger or fear? No. This is not gonna work. - This is some bullshit. - Desperation maybe. I mean anger and fear, all of it together. I don't know anymore. Well, if you could tell Andrew something... Okay, that is it. I am out of here. - Sorry. - What? No, no, but no, no, no... this... Michael? This ain't right. It's okay. Hi, ma'am, I'm sorry to disturb you, but uh, any chance you've seen this little girl? No? Ah well, she's my daughter and she's missing, so would you uh... would you mind taking a flyer in case you see or hear anything? Appreciate it. I'm... I'm... I'm sorry again. Thank you. Have a good day. Call that number please if you see her. There is a big charity event going down tonight. Charity event? Fuck me, Jeff. Kid, if you don't want the work, I can throw it to somebody else. You haven't given me anything good in months, Jeffrey. I'm not interested in charity events. Christian, get your head out of your ass. That attitude is exactly why I can't trust you with bigger stories anymore. Get over yourself and start writing again. You haven't been delivering for too long. Fine, okay. You're walking a very thin line here, sport. Let it flow. Don't be so hard on yourself. Let it flow and you'll see. It all comes in. When you focus too much on it, you get frustrated. So, let's go. Come on. One, two. Come on, one, two. Chris, I need a better round, baby, - you gotta focus. - One, two, one two. Beautiful. Beautiful. - There you go. - Stay relaxed. Keep your hands up. Yeah, there you go. One, two. Come on, man, are you serious? Are you gonna fucking focus on this? We could do this all day. Do you wanna get yourself knocked out? That was good. That was good. - That was like four times. - Focus, man. Keep your hands up. You need to earn yours. Alright. This is better. You did good, kid. And here is another one for you. Can't wait. This one is gonna require more digging. This little girl, Monique Watson, disappeared from her apartment eight days ago. The parents are Michael and Tiffany, they have an older son, Andre. It's looking bleak on finding her. I remember something. - We reported on it, right? - Yeah. Is there something new? Well, the cops aren't pursuing it. I mean you know how it is, I mean a poor black family in a poor black neighborhood, bam, the cops just aren't interested, literally, they don't give a fuck. And why should they? They don't give medals for that, right? I've read the stories. I want you to do a follow-up on this. - Just check-in with the family? - No, no, no, no. I want you to get over there and see what you can dig up. You know, there might be something real obvious, that the police missed or haven't looked into or didn't really wanna look into. Now this is something I can sink my teeth into. This is a story. I wanna know what's really going on out there. I need you to do me a favor. Can you pull a file for me? It's a missing person. A Monique Watson. Yeah, she went missing eight days ago. And her parents are Michael and Tiffany. Look, just walk away I don't want 'em diggin' at us. Hey fellas. Fellas! Yo, what's up, young money? What, you got lost? No, I am just... I am looking for a little information. I was wondering if you maybe can help me out. Well, actually I am looking for a building. Yo, no fucking way. Eh, yo bruh, he looking for a building. No fucking way. Okay, actually no, I'm looking for a family. Name's uh... Watson. The daughter went missing a couple days ago. What, you police? No. News. My name is Christian. Christian, huh, bruh? That sounds um, royal. But look, bruh. Everybody heard about that girl, alright? But that's the hood business though, that ain't for you. Alright. Yeah, I understand. I know how things go around here. You do, huh? - I try. - Oh, you do or you try? Look, I'm just trying to get a little information. Now, it's my understanding that the police haven't been too helpful. Yeah, no shit. 'Cause all you motherfuckers coming around here say you gonna help, ain't nobody found that girl yet. And the only one that care about us is us, you feel me? Look, my newspaper reaches a lot of people. And sometimes it makes people pay attention to something they haven't been paying attention to before. And sometimes those people are cops. You get where I'm going with this? Uhuh. You understand how things go out here? Yeah. That's a nice watch, man. You can take it or leave it, 100 or nothing. It's the building on the back side, better walk around in the alley. - Right there? - It's right there. Alright, thanks. Do what the fuck you wanna do, bruh. Oh, don't you waste a free pass. Might be the only one you get. Hey, hold the door. Thanks. Who is it? Christian Baker, sir. I'm with The Chronicle. I am looking for Michael Watson. - Mr. Watson? - What exactly do you want? I'm just looking to get your side of the story from Monique's disappearance. I'm here to help. Help? You can help me by getting the fuck out of here. Mr. Watson? I'll get there as soon as possible. I'm in Brooklyn right now. Yo, no luck? Alright, oh wait. Hey yo, come here, man. - I have to call you back. - Don't be scared. Don't be scared, man. Come here, come here. Dededede. Yeah, you were right, they didn't want my help. I mean, look at you. Coming up to town, looking white as J. Lo all that fancy shit on, of course they didn't wanna talk to you. What the fuck are you gonna do? That little girl is gone for a week. You got new information for me or you just stopping me to bust my balls? Oh, you know how things work out here. Yeah. Son, sometimes people come up missing and sometime people disappear when other people come up missing. You follow me? So maybe there's a guy who went missing on the same day as the girl and maybe that's related. Maybe it's not, I don't know. Yeah, maybe that guy went on vacation. This nigga. Thanks, man. Hey, yo, yo, now hold on, hold on, hold on. Yo, check out where you at. Now, do we look like vacation people? You want more, I told you, I like that watch, man. This guy is a cab driver, right? Haitian cat. He lived up here in B6. Now he's supposed to be in that corner every day for like years, dog. I mean every fucking day he was here like clockwork. This nigga never missed one. Until one day he stopped being here. Now later the same day, the little girl pop come outside asking us if we seen her, feel me? Now I'm not saying these things are related, but come on, son, this shit looking mad suspect. You mind if I quote you on that? Son, fuck yourself. I ain't no snitch, man. But yo, maybe that girl is still alive somewhere. Yeah, maybe. Hey, time for you to be out, nigga, let's go. Get the fuck out of here, man. Skinny white guy. I need you to pull any missing persons reported within the 72 hours on Monique Watson's disappearance. Yeah, what... in her area. Well, if my information is correct, this is gonna make for a really nice story. Kid, it seems like a little bit of a stretch. Oh, come on, you have to admit it sounds really fishy. Again, we have a witness saying that he was there every day until the day the girl went missing. And then no one seen him since. On top of that I have a quote on record from his dispatcher saying that he hasn't called out in four years of working there And should that be enough? Well, it is for me. Listen, it's not like we accused the guy. He went missing. It doesn't mean he's guilty or has anything to do with the girl. But why nobody bothered to make the connection? Why nobody bothered to investigate it? Because nobody gives a fuck, that's why. We put it out there and then it'll open us up to a lot of follow-up articles. All we have to do is give the Department good enough reason to investigate the case. Okay, fuck it, let's run it. Mhmm, yeah. Alright, okay. I'm just finishing up. Okay, bye. So this is it? I should say so. That family is in for a big surprise tomorrow morning, huh? Jesus, if I was them, I'd hate to find out about this from a newspaper. Yeah, well, I'm on my way out. - See you tomorrow. - Have a good night. Oh! I see, I won't be home in time. Okay. Well, put her on the phone, I wanna talk to her. Okay, thank you. Hi, sweetie. I know, mom told me. But honey, that's no reason to fight. Different people have different ideas. That makes it special. Evans and I have lots of different ideas, but we don't fight. Yeah. Hey, how's your tummy? Oh, good. I'm glad. No, not tonight, but I'll wake up you in the morning, okay? I'll get you set for school. Alright. I love you, too, honey. Sweet dreams. Put momma back on the phone, please. So put momma back on the phone, you goofball. Alright. I love you, too. Okay. Hey, honey. Ah, she is fine, she just wanted to talk to me. I gotta go. I gotta go. Bye, hon. Ortega! Don't run. Please don't run. Ugh. What have I just fucking told you? You motherfucker! Ortega! Fucking asshole. Our Father who art in Heaven... I don't... Halloed be thy name, thy kingdom... I don't know what else to say to you. Will be done. I don't know if you are even listening. ...as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. God, I have nothing to offer in return. Forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass... So I surrender. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. All I know is I just can't quit on her. ...thine is the Kingdom. She's the light of my eyes. ...and the glory. God, please, why her? Give us this day our daily bread. And... I can't understand. Please, I beg you, please, please, bring her back. Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. Forever and ever. Amen. Mrs. Watson. I'm... I'm Christian Baker from The Chronicle. Mr. Baker, I'm sorry, but this is not a good time for us to talk. My family is under a lot of pressure right now. I just can't... Well, hey, it's just gonna take a few minutes. I'm reporting on how the police are handling your case. Nobody is helping us. Nobody knows anything. The cops came around, they searched the building, and then they just stopped coming. The newspapers just ask the same questions. I understand. I might be able to help. I have a couple of things that are just... I needed to talk to you about. It won't take long. But I can't do it out here. It's okay? You can uh, you can sit here. Now, we don't have any hard evidence, but I... I found a lead on a suspect that the cops don't know about. And my newspaper is gonna publish an article about it tomorrow morning and I thought that your family should know before it goes out. Please do not play with me, Mr. Baker. Okay, the last thing we need is false hope. No, ma'am. Now, what I can promise you is that when the article comes out, when people take notice, the police will be forced to reinvigorate their search. Hey, Tiff. I'm home. Baby, I'm in here and we have a guest. Baby, this is Mr. Baker, he... What the fuck are you doing in my house? - Get the fuck out right now! - Michael! I know who he is. I told you to stay away from my family. I understand you're going through... You don't understand shit. Michael, this man can help us. Nobody is helping us, Tiffany. Now, I don't know why he's here, but it's not to help. You tryin' to write a nice piece about a poor black family for all the people downtown to read over their morning coffee? Is that what this is? Man, my daughter is missing and the police don't give a damn about it. Do you care about that? Does that part of the story actually interest you, huh? - I have information. - Information, huh? Why don't you take your information and get the fuck out of my apartment? Baby? Michael? Get the fuck out! Can you please calm down, Mr. Watson? - I'm just trying to help. - Don't tell me to calm down. I'll calm down when you get the fuck out of here. Baby, please! Please. What if he can help us? Please, Michael. Look. I need you to understand that we are in hell. Do you get what I'm saying here? My daughter is missing and you know what the police did about it? They knocked on couple of doors, walked through the building, and then they left. That is the help we got. I... I... I guess they got better shit to do, right? My son, he can't even go to school anymore, because he keeps having panic attacks. We don't need any more reporters, because it's not gonna get me a single step closer to holding my little girl in my arms. I'm tired, man. And I'm scared. She was so brimming. She was my everything, man. You ever have everything and no money where all you wanna do is come home to your family and that was all you needed, and then all of a sudden somethin' comes and rips your heart out? Do you have any idea what that's like? And then you wonder, you walk the street and every child you see and every little child's voice you hear, you think just maybe it might be your little girl? Do you have any idea what that's like? Do you? So what are you gonna do about it, huh? You're right, Mr. Watson. The police don't give a damn about your daughter. But I might be the only person who can make 'em. Now... now I'm listenin'. Hey, Mike. Today's paper. Father, we come to you right now just thanking you for everything that you've done for us. And make sure she is okay. She is safe. And she is warm, and she's happy. Please. That's all I ask of You. We miss her and we need her back. In Your name, we pray. Amen. Yeah? Sam, it's fucking early, man. Found who? Yeah, no, I'll meet you... I'll meet you there. I'm... I'm leaving now. - Yo. - Hey, boss. Have you seen this little girl? You mind taking a flyer? No, I gotta run, man. No, come on, man, it's my daughter. Haven't seen her, I swear to God. Just... just... come on... Just in case. Hey, just take a look, man. I uh... Maybe your neighbors know. My colleague, Christian and I, wrote the story, Mr. Baker. We work at The Chronicle. - Baker? - Yeah, that's right, Mr. Baker. Sounds familiar. Sam Perkins. We work at The Chronicle. I really hope you find her, because this is a... - I hope... - ...it's a tragedy. - Christian! - Yeah, what's going on? Hey. Okay, is he in yet? No, he's not in yet. Well, have you heard anything? That's him. Get back! People move back! Move back! When did they bring you in for questioning? Yeah, where is the girl? When did they bring you in for questioning? Just uh, move back. When did they bring you in for questioning? Do you know where the girl is? Are there any charges at this point? Everyone stand back. Back off. Back off. Go on. It was just insane. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. Hmm. This was like people yelling, screaming. The car was halfway up on the sidewalk. And she's in the hospital fighting for her life. It's okay, Marco. You did good, you did very good. Thank you for sharing. Mr. Watson? No. Freddy, welcome back. Thank you. So what's going on in there? We're cracking him, Captain. He's soft, soft as shit. Now listen, fucking press called us out by finding this guy. They are making it look like we are not doing our jobs. So if this is the guy, let's pin him quick and let's wrap this thing up. And if he's not the guy, you make him the guy, hmm? I did not do anything. I'm innocent. Please, you have to believe me. Can you picture? I mean picture yourself, walking out the front door of this station. You think you can go back to your job? Nobody out there cares what you think you did or didn't do. All of New York City is looking at you. Every single person. They all know that you took that poor, innocent, little girl and had your way with her. I... I did not. I promise, I did not do anything. Plead temporary insanity. Induced by alcohol abuse. That's not a bad defense. I don't care. You get somebody. That is unless you want a fuck ton of monkey screaming in that zoo they call "the hood" out there. - You understand me? - And I don't want that. No, sir. I have enough headaches. So get back in there and break him down. Get creative. Improvise motherfucker, improvise. I drink a lot, too. And the fucked-up part about is sometimes my memory gets a little foggy, you know? Your memory every get foggy? I... I don't know. - You ever black out? - No. You don't think maybe you... you blacked out and you maybe did something you wouldn't normally do. Something involving a little girl? Please, this is not right what is happening. This is not right. And which day was that? Forgotten to mention it before. See, see, see... I've seen the girl before, but I did not know her. You have seen the girl? Yes. Before you were saying that you didn't know anything, but you have been watching her. No, no, no, no. Not at all, not at all. See, I park my car in the same spot every morning. And you watch Monique Watson walk by! No, I don't watch her. I see her walk to school sometimes. That's it. - I don't watch her... - Nah, ah, ah. I'll... I'll tell you... I'll tell you what you did. I know exactly how this went down. No. You watched that little girl every day for a month. - You learned her routine. - No. You couldn't wait for her to walk by in the morning. And then the day finally arrived, you got your phony alibi all squared away. And you waited for her to show up, you fucking monster! You told her you have something to show her. Like we all know she's a little girl and you seem like a nice enough guy. So why wouldn't she follow you? - Where did you take her? - I did not touch her. I did not touch her, I did not. I did not do anything, I promise. I did not do anything, I promise, I promise. - I promise. - Are you fucking crying? No, no. Are you fucking crying? I have seen the girl before, but I did not know. Yeah, no shit you've seen the girl, you sick piece of shit. How did it feel to grab her... take her way? Huh? Did it feel like you were doing the right thing? I did not do... I hope you like getting fucked in the ass, because that's exactly what's gonna happen when your skinny ass gets locked up. We have you on record saying you were following her. Might as well tell us the rest! And maybe... maybe we can cut you a deal. Hmm? What do you say? I... I never said that. I never said that, I didn't. Are you calling me a liar, huh? Say it again! Call me a liar, huh? - You say it again, huh! - Cannot breathe. Hey, hey. Easy, easy! - Cannot breathe. - You ain't nothing. - Easy! - You ain't nothing! - Take it easy. - You hear me? You are no-fucking body. Nobody! Sir, I finally got a hold of the rehab center. Guy's alibi checks out. Shit, give me that. His checking date is the day before the girl disappeared. You sure this is legit? The receptionist sent it and in fact Dr. Bolt confirmed he was there. You gotta be fucking kidding me. Fuck! He had likely already passed away before he was removed from the police station. And now we go to a press release at the rehabilitation center that Yann Abelard was attending days prior to his apprehension by the police. I would personally like to offer my deepest condolences to Mr. Abelard's family. In the little experience I had with him, he struck me as a good man. We have no further statement at this time. I fucked this up. You gotta let me make it right. We fucked this up and we can't make it right. We just have to ride it out. Go home. Lay low for a while. If this blows over, I'll put you back as soon as I can. If this blows over? If it blows over. You know what I'm saying? Like he's really interested. Jesus, man. Yo. - Did you... - Come on, bro. Who is it? Mrs. Watson? It's Christian Baker. I need to talk to you. I can't, Mr. Baker. Please leave before my husband comes home. He's real upset. I know that I might've made a mistake, but your daughter is still out there and someone has to find her. I have a friend inside the police department that will help. Mrs. Watson, please. That man is dead, Mr. Baker. Please, we don't wanna involve ourselves in anybody else's tragedies. We just want our daughter back. Please just leave before my husband comes home. Just go. Days like this get me wondering, you know? You ever think maybe we're not doing the right thing? That's your first mistake. I mean, you tell me if this is right. A guy is dead. Sorry, an innocent guy is dead. An innocent guy is dead and this girl is still missing. Fuck outta here. You are not going wobbly on me. No, I'm just thinking, wondering if maybe we went too far? Too far? No. Well... I don't know about that. How in the world is this fair? - Fair for who? - Exactly my point. We went too far, man. Way too far. Yeah, well, what if we didn't and this was the guy? The problem is he's not the fucking guy! That's the problem! Okay, fine. It's a 50/50 proposition. We might be wrong, but we're usually right. If we hesitate, start catching doubts, we'll never get the answers that we're looking for. The price is the problem. Everything's got a price. What costs you is doubt. I guess you forgot our first ride together. I just made detective, two weeks in the squad. We caught a bodega robbery in progress. Punk could not shoot straight. I could. Put two rounds in his belly and it was over. But I couldn't stop shaking. It was just a kid, maybe I should have done things different, but... you came over to me, you grabbed me, you shook me hard, you said, "Evans, get it the fuck together." That kid almost killed us. He would've hurt a lot more people if you hadn't stopped him. We don't doubt. We don't look back. It costs too much. "Two seconds of doubt will leave you dead." That's what you told me. It's the cost. The cost is always the problem. I know your daughter got you in your head thinking, but you cannot go wobbly on me. I'm a human, I feel for the guy too, but if you don't go that hard, how you supposed to take down the dude you know is lying to us? Ain't no shame in the game. No shame in the game. My baby. I just want my baby back. I want this case closed. I'm not risking my job, because some dumb black little bitch got lost on her way home. So you hit the family and you hit them hard. Here you go. - Egg? - Yeah. Good. What's wrong, man? Everything about this case, that's what's wrong. If you want to know, there you have it. Man, we already went over this. Let's just do our job. Don't get personal. Don't get personal? You know, you sound like the chief. "Don't take it personally." Got his voice rattling around in my head. Look, what are you upset about? We already agreed that we would go over there and to... No, no man. You agreed. I keep trying to tell you stuff over and over, but you are not listening. I don't like it. It doesn't feel right! We've got no evidence. The chief just needs us to nail somebody. Anybody. He doesn't care who. There's no eyewitness. We're just trying to save the chief's fucking ass. I get it. But I don't think we should ignore the possibility. We never looked at them, right? You said that. What if they did have something to do with it. If. Even unintentionally, but something. So let's go over there, see for ourselves then we can cross it off the list. It's just procedure, okay? Procedure, my ass. Okay, fine. But I'm only doing it, 'cause I wanna see it for myself. Well, alright. And no bullshit this time, okay? We go in there, yadah-yadah-yadah, no extra shove. If we feel the time is right, we go after the kid. If it's him, fine. If it's not, we let him go. Okay. Okay. This is a bagel. I told him to give you a white bread. Then maybe he doesn't like black people. Maybe he knew it was for you. Fuck you. Andre, baby, get the door. Morning, son. Your parents home? Terrible what happened. But now we know for sure that he didn't take her, so we have to start looking other places. So you starting a new search. It's about time. Watch your tone. What? We didn't have much to go off of before. Yann was our strongest lead. God rest his soul. He was troubled. Right, but now he's gone, rest in peace. So we are looking at other possibilities. You don't... Man, what is this? Why is your boy so nervous? You gotta be kidding me. My daughter is gone and we are all on edge. Is he being serious with this? Hey, you address me when you're talking. Son, do you know where your sister is? - I don't know. - What the fuck is this? - Michael. - My daughter is missing and y'all supposed to be out there looking for her and you come in my house, accusing me. You show a little fucking respect. Calm down and answer the questions. Where was your boy the day she disappeared? Said he came home early, did anybody see him? - This isn't right, Mich... - You are all fucking tripping! This is some bullshit. Brother, tell this man he being ridiculous. I'm not your brother. I don't know where she is. Boy, you're gonna wanna keep your voice down. Why can't you find her? Why can't they find her? Mom, why can't they find her? Andre. Boy, you need to relax. - She's not here! - You need to relax. She's not... she's not here! Hey Dre, stop it, I mean it. Hey, man! Hey! Just... just... just calm down, alright? I'm very fucking calm. She's not here, okay! Listen to your parents, Andre. Why can't you find her? You're coming with me. Try to stay calm. Show me both hands. - Oh baby. - Show me your hands. Shut up! Don't do this please. Come on. Don't... don't hurt my son. He didn't do anything, man. We'll see about that. Step back. - Woah, woah, woah, woah. - I'm sorry, officer, - my son Andre Watson, he... - It's fine, have a seat please. - Do you any information... - Sit down! Outside! Look, how long do you want us to wait? You cannot keep my child all day long. We're gonna keep him here as long as we need to, alright? Sit down. They better not be hurtin' my kid, man. He's fine. Just sit and wait. Sit down. Thank you. The door please. The door. Thank you. Hey, where's that paper I had before? Thanks. Yo, seriously, he comes back in here again, fucking cuff him. Is it good? Of course. Eat. I'm not hungry, pop. Eat. Oh shit. Bow, where you at? Okay. - It's good. - Okay. Boom, hurry up. It didn't kill you. Not yet. What is it? What's happening? I don't know. What's happening? Some cops. Now they wanna come. What are they doing? Why are they in the garbage? Why they... Hey! What's it look like? There is a homeless here. Take this man for questioning inside. Why are getting in there? Why are they getting in the dumpster? Why are they getting in the dumpster? Michael! Michael! Who is that? Is it... is it her? What is that? Is that her? That's not her. - No. - No, no, no, no. Hey, hey. - Who is that? - Stand back! It's our daughter, it's our daughter! - Wait here. - When it's over... I know! I know, I know. It's gonna be alright. Let us finish this. Let us finish this. - Let us finish this. - My daughter. I know, we're gonna get him. Take it easy. I wanna see. I wanna see. Let us finish this. - We gotta finish this, man. - Get off me! - Get off me! - Take it easy, man Get off me! Get off me... My baby. Oh my God! She's dead. Stand back. Police say they found the body of 10-year-old Tiera Reed. Tiera went missing more than eight weeks ago from outside her home in Brooklyn where she was living with her grandma and two other sisters. Her body has been discovered in a dumpster a few blocks away from her grandmother's home. The search for Monique Watson, another missing girl from Brooklyn, New York continues. Monique disappeared three weeks ago on April 2nd and the police are asking for the community's support. The authorities believe Monique is still alive. Mr. Watson? Michael? Michael? It's time, Mr. Watson. Oh well. My... my name is Michael Watson. My daughter went missing 20 days ago. And uh, we don't know what happened, that's... that's what's killing me inside. Uh, I don't know what else to do, you know. I'm loosing hope and each... each day that passes, I can... I can feel her getting further away from me. I'm losing her by the minute. Welcome. Welcome. Yeah, whatever just uh... I would appreciate it. Thank you. We're gonna have to go over there. Again? Yep. You ain't got no job. You living with your mama. And like yo, first of all look at your hair, first of all, look at your clothes. You know what I'm sayin'?

Well, he's friends with Andre Watson, he's Monique Watson's brother. He's kind of a bigger guy. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I know him, yeah. I mean that kid is a knucklehead but nah, man, he ain't no killer. You know what I'm saying? Did you ever see him around here with any girls or anything? Oh, I've seen him a couple of times with some girls from the block. And one of them named was ah, Keysha. Harris. I think she go to school with them kids. Keysha. Okay, Keysha or Keesha?

So you were supposed to be on vacation, right? Yeah. Thank you. You know, Jeff, think this one's getting to me. Look, uh, you're a grown man and I can't tell you what to do, but I'm gonna tell you what to do anyway. You gotta back off this story. I mean look at your face, for Christ's sake. I mean if you don't stop, this whole thing could be a huge kick in the balls for you. Yeah, maybe. You know, you're acting a little bit crazy here. You know that, right? You're right. You know, I should back off. You're right. You're damn right, I'm right. You're not supposed to be a problem solver. You're an observer. You watch and you write. Stay out of it. Keysha? Keysha, hi. Do I know you? Well, no. But I'm Christian Baker. I just wondered if I could ask you a couple of questions about your ex-boyfriend, Marcus. I'm just writing a silly little story about high school relationships. Marcus volunteered for it. You know Marcus, right? I do know him, but that don't sound like him. Well, it... it's just a simple set of questions. It won't take very long. Okay. Okay, well. Is Marcus a good boyfriend? No, that boy is a fucking asshole. Okay. Why... why was he an asshole? What did he do? He's just aggressive. Aggressive, what kind of... I mean... Like he's aggressive. I don't know what else to say. Aggressive, like he hurt you? He used to get rough with me when we was foolin' around and one time he went upside my head and I don't fucking play that shit, so I had to cut him off. And did you tell anybody about it? Cops or the police maybe. To who? Do you think anybody gives a fuck? My parents? Yeah, right. You know what? We airing our business right now? Please. I think he likes messing with little girls. No, go ahead, please. Just tell me what you know. My little sister, Briana, she has a friend, Amber. She used to come over after school all the time. I don't know, Marcus used to be real nice with her and I thought it was sweet, so I didn't even think nothing of it, but then one day she came over and she was just like mad scared of him. And then she stopped coming over completely. Like I didn't see her again for months until after Marcus and I broke up. Okay. You know where they live, right? Um, yeah, they... they stay on the east side. Would you mind giving me their address? Just wanna ask 'em. So Amber and your sister, they go to the same school? Yeah, they go right over there. The elementary school? Mhmm. Thank you. Whatever. Fuck that boy, right? Yeah. Okay. Think, Christian. The Watsons are in 4A. The Mitchells are in 4B. Okay. And that dude's in 4C. And now, dada, dadada. And then 4C, that... that he was out of town. Come on, alright think, Christian. Come on. He wasn't home. What happened? He was out of town. Who was home at 3:15? What happened? Who was home? What if she didn't go missing on the way home? Think, Christian, think, Christian. Dadadada. What if... come on. Christian, think. What if she doesn't... What if she went missing when she got home? What if... what if she... Wait a minute. And of course... Probably around 3:15. Now who would be there? Distance from school out there. She gets home around 3:15. Who would be at home at 3:15? He could very well have been there. And he probably talked to her. Of course, she wouldn't be afraid. She grew up with Marcus. Wait a minute. Hold on. Fucking son of a bitch. Makes sense. You, motherfucker. Yes. Good. Yo. Somebody just called in a tip. He said that you need to go down Something about Marcus Mitchell. We've been there, there is nothing to find. Hey. Goodbye, baby. Bye, I love you. See you tonight, baby. Sorry guys, I gotta go. - Bye. - Bye. Call me later. Bye, Amber. Bye, Amber. - Bye! - Yes, it's great for me. Coming tomorrow? Duh! See ya! Bye! Hi. Amber? My name is Christian. I'm friends with Keysha. Rihanna's older sister. Thanks for meeting me. Shit, you don't look to good, man. Yeah, I got a story for you. For real? See you later. Marcus, this ain't looking good for you, my man. You told us you were at school the day she disappeared. Three of your teachers said otherwise. And now we got these girls. These two little girls, who both said you did things to them... I don't know what you're talking about, man. And I don't know where Monique is. Something you should know about Spaulding is that he hates niggas. I do. Spaulding is a bad person. I am. And you know what he hates worst then niggas? - Liars. - Mhmm. Can't fucking stand 'em. So you think to yourself, think hard, boy. What can you imagine happen if you take a racist, angry nig with a badge and put him in the back seat with a lying nigga? You get me? Listen to me, you little shit. We know you have the girl. We know you can tell us where she is. You either give her up or you can start shitting out of a bag for the rest of your life, because I'm gonna take you behind a dumpster and shove a two-by-four up your ass. Tell us where the fucking girl is! I don't know, man. You're really fucking crazy! Get off of me! If you really wanna talk, you gotta trust me, kid. It's better if you come clean. I told you, bruh, I don't know. Get off of me! Now you get the fuck out of my car! Yo, y'all are fucking crazy, yo! My name is Michael Watson and my daughter went missing 23 days ago. My name is Michael Watson and my daughter went missing 24 days ago. My name is Michael Watson and my daughter Monique went missing 25 days ago. I am Michael Watson and my daughter disappeared 26 days ago. Why you got me out here, man? What's up? I found something out, I don't know if I should tell you or not, but I think you should know. Please, Christian, whatever it is you got to tell me it needs to be helpful. It's about Marcus Mitchell. Can't be right. I think that I have something. Michael... ...I talked with Marcus' ex-girlfriend and a friend of her little sister's. Marcus got violent with her and the little girl told me that he raped her. Seriously. Can't be right. Why would they lie, man? You know how kids are. They... they say something and then they regret it, you know? And you want to accept that? Listen to me, I talked to these girls and I believe them 100%. I have already gave the names to the cops, they are gonna build a strong case against him and they can probably get him to confess. Sorry, man. I really need to go home. Where's your boy? Is he in there? - What's wrong? - Is he in there? He ain't in here, calm down. I swear to God, if your boy took my girl, I will... Dig that nonsense! I want you to fucking listen to me. I want my daughter back. And if Marcus or you guys have anything to do with it... Listen to me, man, I'll fucking kill you. You're losing it, Mike! Listen to what you're saying! Yo, Mr. Watson. I know you know where she is. I don't know, man, come on, get off of me. If you took my daughter from us and so help me, if you hurt a hair on her head, I'm gonna fucking kill you. I'm gonna fucking kill you, man. Fuck, man! Ma'am, we have a search warrant for these premises. Please step aside. I guess you have the right to an attorney, too, and you better hope he's a good one, you sick fuck. - Fuck you! - Fuck you! Alright everybody, nothing to see here. Now we have a breaking story in the case of a missing local girl. Monique Watson disappeared from her home three weeks ago and today the police have announced a new suspect in the unsolved case. The family's neighbor, 16-year-old, Marcus Mitchell. The police have been under scrutiny since the suicide of Yann Abelard, a taxi driver who's been questioned about the case and took his life while under custody. Marcus Mitchell attends high school with Monique Watson's brother and his family lives in the apartment next door to the Watson family. Police continues to search for Monique Watson and have asked for the public's support. If you have any information regarding Monique Watson's disappearance who's been reported missing on April 2nd... You ready to tell us what happened? I skipped school. I went to the Watsons' house, I knocked on the door. Monique answered. I asked if anybody else is home. She said nah. Told her my mom needed to talk to her. I took her to my bedroom. Told her to take all her clothes off. But she didn't want to, though. I could tell she was really scared. She kept promising not to tell anybody if I just let her go. I didn't believe that shit though. And I picked her up, and I put her on my bed, and she barely even fought. Then my brain started working real fast, I thought, "Ain't no way she'd be able to keep that a secret." It was as if somebody else was doing it. Like I was just standing there watching it happen. And I hit her. Real hard. Boom! And I was watching Tyrell's crib. He's my neighbor and a good buddy of mine. He left me his keys, so it was easy to put her inside his apartment and after into the storage next to the body of the other girl. Nobody knew a thing. Every day I wanted to end her, but seeing the body of the other girl, I just... I wasn't ready to do it again. Just fuck that shit. It was funny though. I was giving her food and water. Took good care of her like she was my daughter, you know? I even forgot about the one in the box. Mhmm, the end. - Hey. - Morning, detective. What we got here. Hello, um, my name is Michael Watson. It's been seven days since my daughter Monique was found. It's been the hardest ride of my life, it was like I died, and went to hell, and came back a week ago. Every day we spent without her made me fall deeper and deeper into a hole. This really dark, cold, scary pit. And I'm embarrassed to say this, but I thought about killing myself more than a few times. I couldn't see past any of the madness, you know? Even now with my baby girl home, I still have these... these mind trips, these panic attacks when she's not near me, you know? And I wonder if... if it all really happened or if it's just a really, really bad dream. But something, something inside me kept me going, you know? My wife says it was God's grace. Had to be. I, by myself, I wasn't strong enough. When my daughter was safe, and we were together, and I can find her, and breathe. I needed to come here tonight to say thank you to each and every one of you for being here for me. You all will always be my rock and I hope I can be yours, too. It's a promise I've made to God and I'm damn sure will keep it. My name is Michael Watson. And I have two children. My daughter went missing six weeks ago and now she's found. And God is good, all the time. According to the FBI's National Crime Information Center, there are a total of 465,676 active missing person records. I am calling to improve measures to search for missing children. This is not just a Police Department responsibility, it is the people's responsibility. We need to be kind to one another, and we are not separated as we think. Kindness will affect the world and will help us find that common bond that we are very much searching for. Here is to all the kids that haven't come back home. Lisa Irwin. Polly Klaas. Jessica Lansford. Cherrie Mahan. Megan Kanak. Ethan Alexander. Walter Morrison. Lili Cosi. Peter Spencer.
