Here, we do have Dostoyevsky Wait, no, it's "The Brothers Karamazov" - I've been meaning to read that - I need to register you then - Of course - Are you registered? Your full name? Aleksandr Ivanovich - Ivanovich - Ivanovich The date is 29.10.1942 - I used to dream of other things. - What things? They were naive childish dreams About things that were light, pure, kind... About... "Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again" "There's a faint, cold fear coursing through my veins" "It's almost freezing up the heat of life" "I'll call them back again to comfort me" "Nurse. What is she going to do here?" "My dismal scene I needs must act alone. Come, vial" "What if this mixture do not work at all?" "Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?" "No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there" "What if it be a poison, which the friar" "Subtly hath ministred to have me dead" "Lest in this marriage he should be dishounour'd" "Because he married me before to Romeo?" "I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not" "For he hath still been tried a holy man" "How if, when I am laid into the tomb..." - Alright then, just make any move - Any move? Let's go with that You have to do something But I understand that move. If I do what you tell me... No, I'm not forcing you - What's important is... - What's important? It's important to make a choice and evaluate... The consequences, for example - Does this only apply to chess? - To everything It's a general principle Let's go like this Where's the Big Dipper? And there are stars we never see... You can only see them from the other side Sometimes what we see is actually an explosion that happened a few million years ago Yes, I know So what we're looking at could be from the distant past - So we're watching the past? - We're watching the past. Yes, exactly Beautiful, isn't it? See you tomorrow See you in the morning? See you I'll see you off with my eyes Alright When you're constantly getting news about people Friends or friends being killed While you're sitting here doing calculations... You don't want it any more. All you want is to grab a gun and go Stay here The war won't last forever. The war can't last forever What does last forever? Love "Shall I not then be stifled in the vault" "To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in" "And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?" "Or, if I live, is it not very like" "The horrible conceit of death and night" "Together with the terror of the place" "As in a vault, an ancient receptacle" "Where, for these many hundred years, the bones" "Of all my buried ancestors are packed" "Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth" "Lies festering in his shroud: where, as they say" "At some hours in the night spirits resort" My first meeting I'm looking forward to it Katya Come outside, let's go for a walk There's a dry flower in the vase Why am I carrying it? What's the reason? Can you walk up the stairs please How are you getting on? - How am I getting on? - Yes It varies - Meaning? - Life can vary a lot I can't say I live in a certain way. What do you mean? Are you happy? - That means no - Sometimes - I see - I can't say I'm happy all the time Someone who was happy would reply straight away I believe there is no happiness without suffering and misfortune One thing There must always be something acting as a counterweight Are you prone to falling in love? No No? - And have you ever loved? - Yes Loved or were in love? Loved And do you like the state of being in love? Yes - More than anything in the world? - More than anything in the world So you are prone to falling in love No It seems to me that it's a severe case of inspiration That's what being in love is Because the most incredible moment is the search - Of course - The most incredible moment is not when you're making love with a man you like It's when you're preparing to go on a date Yes. Prob... Well... - I don't know - That's why I'm a theorist, you see? Yes I'm waiting for a miracle to happen The French poet Stephane Mallarme once said... He said: "Come here, my friend" "I'll show you what hell is" "Boredom, that's what hell is" Good evening What a beautiful wife I have No checks? Vasya is also teaching me how to play chess Is he? Lena and I played Why were you held up at work? What were you discussing so long? Dima suggested it. Very interesting You're finally home We'll discuss it tomorrow. Come tomorrow. Shall I heat up something for you to eat? You hungry? Shall I heat it up? Let's try, Dad Just a second Let's choose who takes what Let's flip a coin Lena's the umpire and a learner Do you need this, Vasya? - I can't... - It's alright Let's flip a coin No, we won't be flipping anything Lena, who are you helping? No one Katya is really interesting girl. There is something about her I think she's too thin I'm not talking about sex. I mean in conversation, dialogue There's something... You should talk to her I'd rather talk to you Yes, of course. But she's not like the others [Let's think about this...] Really And he still covered our backs He's from the nobility He remains an intellectual at heart But we don't like intellectuals - Come on - Yes - Let's do it like this - Go on then Move your feet left and right From the left? I see And back again? Controllable choas is what you're used to And you think that you're in control of it But uncontrollable chaos is when your body rejects it It's like... Katya You can't control chaos, it just swallows you up "Artillerymen, the Motherland calls to us" I either have to replace the ribbon or repair it Because it... It doesn't type? It types the first line and then just blocks the letters So you can see where things are, what's not in the library, what we have That will never be possible You'll only know what's not in the Library Never? When I first started I used to specify where the books were May I? So the next day... Tango? Are you a scumbag, or do you just look like one in these glasses? May I try them on? Do I look like a scumbag? A little bit Katya, do I look like a scumbag? - Like who? - A scumbag - Because of the glasses - Can I be honest? - Shall I tell you honestly? - Of course, Katya dear Exactly. To talent Talented people don't know how talented they are Come through. Don't take your shoes off I won't Hello. Come through, Katya dear This is Katya. This is my mother, Valeria Matveevna This is Nora, Dau's wife We've met - What's happened? - Nothing. Why? Why are you so gloomy? - Not gloomy, just quiet - No We were just waiting for you - Shall we eat? - Are you hungry? - I wouldn't mind - Are you going to eat? Yes please. If there's any watermelon left from yesterday that would be great No, there's no watermelon I don't know how to work the tap Yes? Let's try then Just a bit of salt Salt? Just a second, I'll bring it You need salt, yes? - Here you are, Nora - If possible, yes Lena Sit next to me - Alright - Lena, have a seat Will you sit here? What do you want to drink? I'm having lemonade You're in check - Lena, where did Granny go? [- I'm here] Why are you sitting there? Come join us - Let me get you a chair - I don't need a chair All the chairs are there Vasya, how are you doing? Have you beaten Dad yet? The game's in full swing So where did you find Katya? In this life - No, I mean... - At the Institute, or just now? Now, at the Institute In D1 What were you doing there, Katya? Nothing, we were just sitting there talking to our physicists - Was it interesting? - Yes What kind of subjects are you interested in? Various subjects - I don't understand - You don't? - Katya is... - Eternal subjects The subjects of art, of love Art of love? In physics? Love and art are everywhere Otherwise there wouldn't be... - I wonder if... - People don't tend to do what's not supported by an emotion If it can't be expressed emotionally True. And who... That's why I'm so happy to see their love for what they do It's good to see - True - Even though I myself have nothing to do with physics - Vasya - It's alright We're almost equal. I'm only winning by one pawn - Thank you, Lena dear - Dad, Vasya Why are you standing over there, Gran? Why don't you sit somewhere - Come join us, Mum - Yes, coming Are you setting it up again? - Katya dear - Yes? - Have you eaten? - I will eat - You will, or you still are? - I will have more later Time to retreat - What's the matter? - I don't feel comfortable Why? She's your wife, and I... So what? When I got married I told her I told her: you know, I don't want to do it Not unless I remain free. I really do love her - I know - We're very close You know, I can't close my heart and stop falling in love Excuse me, guys, but let's go in at least Why don't you make up your mind No, I'm going - Let me talk to her - No, let's go home, you can talk there - Shall we, Katya? - No - Goodbye - You know what? You don't have to come But you must listen to me I think it's only polite I can listen to you here Katya, let's just go in Seriously. Let's go in and you'll just finish the conversation Then Dau will see you off Standing here, outside is just not right - Why not? - For one thing, there are cars driving around and we are standing in the road Shall we go in? Nora, could you chuck me my cigarettes? Dau, I have cigarettes You know what? It's very hard for me to have this conversation I find it hard too Because on the one hand dreams should remain dreams On the other hand, you can't be... How can I put it? You can't be a coward But if you start a revolution you have to stay very alert to make sure you don't end up with a totalitarian set-up like you were fighting before See what I mean? If we, you and I... If I weren't married and you became my wife and we had children there's a chance that we could start that revolution and stay in love for the rest of our lives We would never look at another man or woman, and would never dream of anything else because this would shine so bright... It's a possibility We're always hoping for this But mostly what we observe shows us the opposite that people want change There's a scientist who says we change so quickly that we should change our names every week Where is my youth? If dreams can never come true at least they're a recipe for happiness To be a clairvoyant of dreams - Excuse me - Sure I thought I'd bring you some wine - Thank you, Nora dear - Thank you Here's your cognac No thanks you, darling. I'd like some tea And some wine for you. I'll leave you the bottle Thank you Do you want tea? - Yes. Would you like some, Katya? - No I'm going for a walk - Are you waiting for something? - No I was smoking Do you have any more smokes? Yes, of course Shall we go and sit down somewhere? Listen, Katya You are unlike any of the girls my Dau was interested in before What I wanted to talk to you about was... It really hurts me Do you want to try it with him? Thanks I can't promise anything He's a complex person Honestly, I just... You're just curious, aren't you? You want to see what'll to happen next You just can't leave it I keep thinking about him, that's why... That's why I talk to him and spend time with him sometimes But when I come to work I think I might see him in the evening I keep thinking about it Are you sure you need this? How do I know? If you don't know yet I'd like to ask you to leave it If I could leave it I would have done it back there Back then, the day we first met But I didn't leave it I just saved your life - And mine - Yours? Oh, mine? And yours then. Ours I really like your hands Where are you going? I'm falling If only you knew how much I longed for this moment. To be with you - Lydia - Yes? Have you eaten? - Perhaps you'd like some borscht too? - I'm not hungry, Nora - There is no air in here - Air? Yes, no air... Why do I want both to reject you and let you in. Why? Dear friend Hello Hello. How are you? Fine - Could I..? - Whatever you need I'll take care of everything - Do you know Katya? - Yes Head of the library? - Yes - It is very nice to meet you - Likewise - Yes Katya, one second I have a big problem and I need your help My pleasure Except, I don't know, I feel little awkward [A delicate issue?] [Very] Slava Get up Get dressed One, two, three, four five, six, seven, eight nine, ten, eleven, twelve thirteen, fourteen fifteen, sixteen seventeen, eighteen nineteen, twenty Ready or not, here I come Not here There is no one here Well No, there's no... Right We found Grandma Why did you meow? That's no fun Scared? Show me your knickers Why? Why not? You're not afraid to show me your soul Knickers are less intimate than the soul Actually The time probably hasn't come yet The time when you can say, I am going to live At the moment you are waiting and watching You're not fully involved in it, you're just an observer Because you are afraid You know every step in life is wrong But at a distance at a point where different things cross it can seem right And vice versa Everything's right here but at a distance it's wrong Save my life - Hello - Hello We're playing lazybones Hello, we're playing lazybones - Hello - Who did you bring? - You lose - Why? Because you blinked Hi Katya Vasya is going to finish the last line and then we'll read our masterpiece Dad It doesn't matter if we're watching or not. Keep writing Just don't make any comments, Lena - What do you mean, comments? - About what Vasya is writing Come here, come to me How are you doing? Not tired, are you? - No - Great See, it's better to have lots of different games - Right, Lena? - Yes - Would you like some Borjomi, Katya? - No thanks Dad, you won't be able to fold it Wait, I'm just thinking how to What? One moment. This is an interesting set-up One moment Look, how beautiful. What is it? - We tried - Looks like buckwheat with chicken - That's it - Delicious Right, we have no time for this now - One moment. Yes, Dau? - Come on, sit down - Here. Read it again if you like - Can I talk to you? Yes, alright - Dau, come with me a second - Would you like some champagne? - I've already had some wine - Wine? - Red? - I think it's best not to mix them Very well. Lyosha One moment, Nora, I'll open it for you now So? You can talk and open it at the same time Yes, I can talk and open it at the same time Pass me the corkscrew, please Nora, can we talk for a second? Yes Here's the cockscrew There Here - Can I say something? - Yes I want to sleep with Katya How about the three of us together? - But where will I sleep? - Together We'll just sleep. Nothing else You'll stay won't you? Does it bother you? Let's have a try If you don't want to, just say But I know that you want to I want her to be near me And I want you to be near me I will be And what does Katya want? She won't agree to it She might - We'll have to ask here - Shall we bet on it? Fifty rubles I put a hundred on her agreeing I put a hundred on her not agreeing. Let's go That one was a 1947 edition I'm afraid this might be later, you know Let's try to find it, unless it's been edited out - Lyosha, what are you looking for? - There was a wonderful sentence Very funny One moment. If it's here I'll find it Lyosha, can we talk while you're looking for it? Yes, talk amongst yourselves while I look for it Go on, talk - It's impossible - Katya? We have Alexey's permission. Yes? Do you want to stay here to sleep with us today? To sleep in our bed, the three of us together Do you want to? Why not? Maybe you shouldn't actually Why? Are you scared? You scared of your own suggestion? - No, no. Very well - No Did you expect me to say "no" and run away? - Wonderful. Great - Good Katya, sorry, do you mind if Dau and I have a quick word? - Go ahead, of course - Thanks Perhaps someone else could spend the night wih us too Something's not right here Who knows who better - Yes, Mum? - You know I expect we'll head off to bed now You're off to bed? Well, sure, the children are tired Just let them play for a bit because the children definitely won't sleep with this music on They can listen for a bit and then head off to bed Just look how handsome you are - Almost like Apollo - My God. Like Apollo Why are you hiding? - Am I undressed? Am I? - One second.Yes you are - Well that's that - Ah, that's how it is? Very well Lyosha, wait. Katya and I will only undress to a Pushkin poem Yes, Pushkin - It can't be any other way - Alright Wait, are you going to undress at the same time? - Don't start yet, Lyosha - Yes, I know. I'll undress One moment One second. We didn't agree that you would watch us - Turn around - Ah, so that's how it is Precisely Wait, I'll just find what I want "We must also remember these, for example, The former poet, old Panzebitter" "Our right and honest priest, And the merchant Ritter" "Rezanov, the great Russian confectioner" "All Orthodox Christians from the city of St Peter" "The late Jupiter" "We must remember, we really must" "The Moscow Poet Veliashev" "His Excellency, General Ivashev" "And your cousin and my cousin in general" "Walter Scott Masalsky, Don Miguel" Dau's hungry. What about you? - Yes, that's be nice - We have... Perfect - I must have gotten it wrong - Me too Yes, well, what do you know I don't understand. I did my courses, I served at the Front I don't understand how it is. You're the Intelligentsia That girl in Kharkov was a prostitute, that's obvious You're a nobleman How many children do you have? A lot - Really? - Several villages worth [- You do look like Lenin a bit - I have blue eyes] [You do look like Lenin] [That's what saved you] [I knew straight away] [- Not that I... - It does save me] [You know] [I bet my father worked for your estate] To Marshal Voroshilov Better, to the Defenders of Leningrad and the Defenders of Leningrad No, Russia was full of roads and fools Really? Yes You should all have been Defenders of Leningrad with the exception of Karamzin Even the blind had fought You are always escaping. Aren't you? What is it, Katya dear? - You don't want me, do you? - I do I don't see that - What do you mean, I don't? - You don't You men. Look at what science does to you, just look No fighting - Go away, Lyosha - Go? - It hurts - It hurts? Again with the crying? - Stop it - Bring me some water. That's it, enough Go away. I'm going to kill you. Just go away Go away I knew there would be moments like these But I didn't think it would be you Perhaps you're hoping to trample on every single one of my dreams Is that what you want? And then you came Like an angel into that world to save me when my dreams were dying What happened to my dreams that were gently trying to sleep in your shell? What happened? Please leave Farewell, dear Katya Farewell Farewell How are you preparing for death? Do you think it's a gift or a release? Tanya What does death mean to you? Death? Liberation From what? From everything And what do you want to liberate yourself from? Your daughter? I'm talking about what you actually have in your life Ephemeral love? Is that what you want to liberate yourself from? Tanya What I actually have I would never define it as ephemeral love - Alright - If it's not reciprocal, it doesn't mean Did you do anything to make it reciprocal? Did you use your imagination? Your female intuition? It's no way to live That's not a decision in favour of living a wholehearted, fully-fledged life To be happy for just a few days Am I wrong? I wonder whether there are people who are always happy Are you ever happy? - I can be happy - I want to know what you No, I can be happy. Are you ever happy? Yes "Dressed for the road, the Tsar departed, The Tsarina, tender-hearted" "At the window sat alone, Wishing he would hurry home" "Day and night she sat and waited, Gazing till her dedicated" "eyes grew weak from overstrain Gazing at the empty plain" "One fond glance at him she darted, Gasped for joy with thin lips parted" "Then fell back upon her bed And by prayer-time was lying dead" "Long the Tsar sat lonely, brooding But he, too, was only human" "Tears for one sad year he shed And then another woman wed" "She, if one be strictly truthful Was born a Tsarina youthful" "Slim, tall, fair to look upon, Clever, witty and so on" "But she was... sur" "surly" "Stubborn, haughty, wilful, jealous" "Only with this looking-glass would she In a pleasant humour be" "Many times a day she'd greet it And..." And... I have forgotten What a memory Tatyana, what a wonderful child you have - Mummy, will you tell me the story? - Of course And you'll take me to the zoo? - And to the zoo - You'll even buy me ice-cream? - Yes - You'll definitely tell me a story? - Well, let's go - Good-bye, Comrade Masha Say goodbye to Katya Goodbye See you. Here you go Good-bye Alexander Viktorovich Let's go Let's go, let's go - Katya, dear - Yes? Have you got something to read I could borrow? Mum, I remember you promised to tell me one more fairytale Let me think what the fairytale could be about - What fairytale would you like? - Any - Doesn't matter which one? - No - Let's sit down - Who should it be about? I don't know Are you warm enough? - How about - Do you need the bathroom? - No - Sure? Come on, tell me a story - What about those arms? - About the arms? Who do you think could have three arms? - You don't know? - An octopus has eight I don't know Let's try to describe these arms. What are they like? - They're big - Big What else? - Loving - Loving hands? Well, I guess so, since he's holding something so tight - They love it, right? - Right - They love it, right? - Right The hammer, the brain and the sickle - Hello - Hello Hello - Who's home? - Kaledin and I Hello - Is everything alright? - Yes, of course - Alexey Yurevich decided to have a drink - In solitude? Trifonov's here Calm down, why are you reacting like this? Calm down, relax Look at you breathe What? I don't understand Get out of here, do you think I want to talk to you? I don't know what you want, you don't tell me anything You've said nothing, and I'm trying to understand you keep avoiding me When you're silent, I try to understand you through your eyes Judging by your actions, I must have misunderstood You did You see What do you want, can't you tell me? I want nothing from you, get out - Nothing? - Just go Are you absolutely sure? Yes One hundred percent? Don't confuse your desires with reality, now get out Go away, this is my bedroom, I'm telling you to go away Alright Well then Otherwise. Go, just go Otherwise what? Otherwise I'll go. Just leave If I'm not wanted I won't insist Alright, great Tanya Would you like your child to live the same way you do? - No - Then how? What do you want her to change? Shall I say the first thing? So she has no guilt - Yes - The second? - For her to love a real person - Yes But what's stopping you from doing that now? And being an example to her so that later, when she grows up, you can talk to her but based on reality rather than imaginary life and fairy tales You know, when I read fairytales to my daughter, it feels like I deceive her When I separated from my husband at the beginning they saw each other often Later he started a new family Another child came along I feel so guilty towards her You are not guilty She has you I'm not enough for her She barely sees me Recently she was drawing my portrait and was asking her grandma what colour my hair was I feel like you understand me You're beautiful I'll fall in love with you How about we Calm down I'm scared Katya, Katya What now? We have an orange. Ever tried tea with orange? We have a lemon There's the lemon Do you want attention? What do you want? I don't understand Katya I don't think you're hearing me You're right, what then? What did you say that I didn't hear? Did you say "Hello, Katya" the next day? I didn't hear that? Did you say anything to me the next day? Or do I just look like a... What do you think I look like? Like a piece of tissue or something? Why did you come and cry? "Thank you, thank you" And the next day I don't exist It's that easy And again you're silent I want to be alone, alright? I see How are things? Why are you so upset? Everything's fine It's spring Let's drink to love It seems the weather has turned for the better I saw three stars - To love? - To love To love I don't write poems, Kaledin Whenever I write poems I ... I may be a clown but not always "We'll drink the maiden's rosy breath" "Filled, perhaps, with plague and death" [He was complaining they took his lab assistant] Our staff aren't blind They see, they hear, they know things We're already dealing with Katya But what shall we do with you? What do you think, Tanya? What about me and Katya? You and Katya have a very good, if slightly unconventional relationship It's known as "Lesbianism" What? People took you away from the table You're trying to vulgarise it - I'm doing what? - Vulgarising it You're saying this to me? - Love is... - I'm the Party member Head of the First Department, and you tell me I'm vulgarising something I'm trying to put everything right and you're telling me I'm vulgarising it - This is hopeless. Thick as a brick - "I don't understand" Is something wrong with you? Why are you smiling? I think the first thing to be done is to shame you in public Pasha, we have to save her Save her from what? - From this sexual delinquency - Look at the way she's acting She's beaming from happiness, grinning from ear to ear What do you mean, save her? She's good now, she's all sorted. Right, Tanya? Everything's fine? We're happy to be in a lesbian relationship? And we don't care what those around us think Am I right? Am I? Is that the way you see it? It's depravity You're vulgarising it, Pasha Shall I give her one, after all? Shall I box her ears? How's your head, strong enough? Who dominates in your relationship? Is it Tanya or you? Let me tell you what a female penal colony is It's a world that's been turned inside out lesbian relationships, they've been made the norm there Even if you don't consider yourself a criminal I'll prove otherwise in just a few minutes. You understand? What are you, Katya? Go on, tell us, be honest A dyke or a decent Soviet woman? Fucking bitch Proud, are we? What's the matter, Katya? What a curious reaction she has Such a great day, isn't it? The greatest day ever What did she do, what do you think? - I don't know - What would you do? If you were a little star living so far away Look, how beautiful she is. You'd live up there, high up in the sky - I'd fall down - You would fall, wouldn't you? So she decided to fall down too She thought that somebody would surely notice her when she was falling That's what happened, can you imagine? First she thought about it for a long time, then suddenly she jumped from the sky While she was flying, we saw a beautiful bright trail It looked like sparkles You know, even passers-by paid attention to it Would you notice that? Of course you would Look, are there any shooting stars? Because it's April - Do you know when stars start to fall? - When? In the summer You can see them very clearly in August A meteor shower So the star jumped She fell down and of course she broke to pieces But at that moment she was noticed She was very happy What do you think? Is it a sad or a happy story? - A happy one - Why? Because a dream came true Do you think happiness exists? When I was little, I would always wait for it And I thought when I'd grow up I'd be very happy Naive childish dreams
