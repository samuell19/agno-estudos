Hear something? - Not coming yet. - Nothing. - It must come, sometime - We have to wait. Waiting so long for each train! Ridiculous! - Why talk that way, Mr. Mirko? - Isn't it fine when it comes in? - You're fine, too? - I'm always fine. - How about you? - Fine, fine. TOO fine. - You, Mariola? - Nice. - Fine, Mr. Mirko! - Fine, indeed. If it's not here in an hour or two, I'm going! IVKO'S FEAST based on the short story by STEVAN SREMAC They're happy like children when they see the train. I don't know if the railroad will do us any good. What do you expect, professor Sremac? I expect to see professor Canitz from Vienna. Educated man... yet a clown. Our first railroad... our pride. How was your trip, professor? I arrived... that's important. This is Ni?. In Roman, Naissus. The birthplace of the Roman emperor Constantine the Great. Whoever set off for Bosphorus had to pass this way. The crusaders too, on their way to liberate Chris's grave. - Oriental town, yes? - The Turks were here for centuries. Yes, but little by little, you go to Europe. Many of us came here from Belgrade, Prague and Vienna. - And from Sarajevo, too! - That lamb smells nice! St. George's Day is near. Everybody here is looking forward to it. - Everybody, including us, Muslims. - Wahrum? Why is that? Because of the hosts of many feasts. I'll be their host for my Bayram. - Bring in here that foreigner. - Later. - Feast? Was ist das? - Explain it to him, please. This is the first thing you should know about Serbs. Of all the Christian community, only the Serbs have the feast. I don't mind your "Ivko's Feast". But Kalca will sue you. Watch out! Ex-King Milan? Isn't he in Vienna? His son, King Alexander, has appointed him commander-in-chief. - He is often here. - When he's not in Vienna. Our first long distance line, between my Sa?a and me. Blessed it be. Directed by: Zravko ?otra Your Majesty, Your Holiness, ladies and gentlemen... The end of the 19th century brings miracles like the telephone! The telephone opens up a whole new world! Would you believe that here and now, in Ni?... ...we can hear the choir singing in Belgrade. This apparatus, the loud speaker will make that possible! Just a moment. Hello... Belgrade! Ni? here! Hello! - Can you hear me? - Hello Ni?, this is Belgrade! Can we hear on the loudspeaker the Belgrade Singing Society? Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Please, restrain yourselves! Forgive us, Your Majesty. Serbia is definitely going down the road to success. - Why does he want to sue you? - Kalca? I wrote a story, "Ivko?s Feast", based on true events. You added up a few things, and they found themselves in it? Yes. The story is very revealing, about the people and the feast. ...You will tell me the story, yes? - It's late. If you don't finish today, you can continue tomorrow, yes? The story goes like this... See that man in the middle, wearing a fur cap? His name is ?ivko. I called him Ivko. St. Georges Day is just a day or two away. Ivko, the quilt maker, is always looking forward to it. Scram! That day his door will be wide opened for everyone. All invited and uninvited guests will be welcome. Invitations are not required for the feast. Apprentices and his wife tidy the house from top to bottom. It will be like that bride in the Bible, awaiting her groom. I washed this morning. Don't come in here, it's clean. Go to the bar with your pals. Take your shoes off. Good morning. You know about my feast? You're welcome. You know about my feast? You're welcome. I'll be there! That's for sure! Don't you worry! MITA KRSTI? - WOLF DRY-GOODS Ivko has three lifelong friends. Wolf got his nickname because of his appetite. Hes a good cook. - Wolf! - Ivko! - Let's eat, I'm hungry! - I'm busy with the feast. Fish drinks by the barrels. Yet, no-one has ever seen him drunk. Let's go for a drink. And if you ever heard of the fabulous Kalca, thats him. Mikal Nikoli? - Kalca, brass maker, always telling hunting stories. They say he lies like a rug. Kalca never lies! Hello, Sike! Good morning, neighbor. Will you lend me your Mariola to serve guests at the feast? It will be an honor to serve in such an eminent house. True, Mrs. Paraskeva. Take care of her... she's mighty pretty. Soda for Ivko, beer for Kalca, and for you two, new vine. They're always together. Who runs their businesses? The apprentices! Who else? I just wonder one thing: How God joined them together? Look at this. - Yes? - Same as usual. Good morning. Who's this? Mr. Kalca... how's hunting? - The game just leaps in my arms. - You don't say? - I'll treat you with a free story. - Please, don't. - I can't listen to it again. - This is a new one. Please, tell us. We'll be much obliged. Who is this guy? I was sitting in my store. The sun was burning... Is this the store of Kalca, the haberdasher? I'm Kalca the brass-maker, there's no Kal?a the haberdasher. - I'm looking for that Kalca, then. - What for? The King is going tomorrow on a hunt. People say that your dog, Capa does wonders. The King sends his regards and asks to borrow your dog. Mister... I'll give my life for the King. But, Capa goes nowhere without me. We'll meet all your demands because of Capa. Be ready tomorrow morning. - Do you know who was just here? - Some officer, I guess. That was King Milan! The King! Classic... Excellent material for a stage play. - You lie like all hunters! - Kalca never lies. St. Georges Day... dawn. The young ones are already on the field for the awakening. May God bless us with a joyful St. George's Day feast. That beautiful morning gave them no reason to expect otherwise. God and St. George. Hello, Mitan?e. - Happy feast, Mrs. Paraskeva. - Thank you. - You got a haircut? - Yes, Mr. Ivko. Put this on, we're going for Matins. In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. - Sike... - Happy feast, neighbor. Please, come in. If anybody asks about Ivko, tell them they're welcome. - Have you offered the wheat? - Not yet. - Happy feast. - Thank you. - Happy feast. - Thank you, Sike. Offer the guests some wheat. Please, come in. Mariola, behave modestly, like a widow's daughter should. - Mother, please go. - I'll go. - You, dreamlike girl. - What was that? Julia! Ophelia! Desdemona! Milady... how shall I call you? Don't call me at all! Scram! - Young lady! - Her name is Mariola. What a beautiful name... Mariola! Mister... Has this ever happened to you? That one look from a girl strikes you like hundred lightning? Really... - What shall I do? - Go inside. - I can't. - Why not? I don't know the host. I'm not invited. Invitations are not required for the feast. - Going to the feast? - Yes. Go in... hurry! - Happy feast. - Please, come in. He can't take off his hat, his hands are full of candies. Happy feast. - Happy feast. - Thank you. Mariola... - Who brought you in here? - By love. By love, that first did prompt me to enquire. - I lent him eyes. - Get out of here! Mariola, serve the wine. Is everybody served? We hear you, all right. Happy feast! - What will you have? - Brandy! Bring some bread and old clothes for my little children and... Shut up, gipsy! We never meant this! It's all right! He's not ours. He's of some other Gypsies. There's Gypsies... Gypsies... and Gypsies. If it wasn't your feast... you could slay us all. I'll slay him, and his whole family! - Not good, this quarrel. - Not a good sign. - Let's drop by at Ivko?s. - We can't drop by at Ivko?s. - Why not? - We save Ivko for last. Come on! Thank you, please come in... Thank you for coming... Old guests, get up! It's time to let the new ones in! - What will I do with the coffee? - I'll help you out. Call me your darling, and I'll be christened again. You're not christened! Master Ivko, it's a nice day for your feast. - St. George's Day is always nice. - Nice! - Not always. I remember one year, we had to light the fire. It was so cold, the baby turkeys froze to death. Poor little baby turkeys. It didn't look like it would be so nice. I was terrified. I don't know if you noticed. - You got your coffee? - Yes, yes. Who knows, one might leave without a coffee. Ivko! - Come in! - Four or five feasts to go! Five more feasts to go, and we're coming! No, six! Mariola, bring some more wine. Who wants tobacco... - We smoke... - Yes, we do. Merci. No! I quit seven years ago! I smoke first thing in the morning. Give him a farewell coffee. If someone would offer me a steak or a cigarette... You'd take both! - Who is this tramp? - I'm trying to figure that out. He already had four farewell coffees... nothing. - Marko is dead... may God be... - You don't say? What I don't say? I mean... Mr. Marko... dead... too bad. What's it to you? Where was I? The late Marko told me, "You? Quitting smoke?" It's getting interesting. Please, continue. I can guess the rest. You made a bet. Then? Since you know everything, you continue! - Where is the host? - Ivko! - How long do you plan to stay here? - You never now. - We can't hurry up here. - We'll take care of the children. - Good idea! - Tell Capa, I won't be long. Ivko! It was about time. You know us. It's hard to bring us in. But you can never drive us out! You know the story about the bear? They plucked his ear to climb him up the tree. They plucked his ear and tail to climb him down! - Come, sit awhile. - Why just awhile? Your house is our house! - Please, stay! - Making place for the younger. - Where to? Is it so bad here? - On the contrary. One should quit when it's best. Is the company getting bad when we come in? When we come in, the company gets better! Please, sit down. Happy feast. Where are your ladies? We're no servants, we have no ladies. We have wives. I have no wife! Kalca, how is hunting? Haven't you heard? You'll hear now. It was mid-winter. Freezing cold. I shot so many of them, I had to rent a donkey. - Here, take a rabbit. - Thank you, Kalca. It was so hot, the donkey and I almost died. - Kalca, you're lying! - Take one! Kalca never lies! You went hunting in the winter, and came back in the summer? Forget it. - You don't need a rifle to catch a rabbit. - How come? You drop on the ground, pretend that you're dead. The rabbit comes near. When you feel him, start wiggling your ears. The rabbit starts to laugh, you catch him with your hands. You're starting to believe in your own lies. Kalca never lies. Woman! Children! Let's go! - Good-bye. - Thank you for coming. Kiss the lady's hand. You're welcome on the third Day of the Pentecost. Everything is sound asleep. Everything is put to a stop. Except for Ivkos feast. You can go home, child. Come, let's eat! Thank God! I can't, I'm too embarrassed. I don't eat at all. - Please... - Help yourselves. - Bring a little brandy. - Just a little? Why? Maybe you'd like some wine? We'd like both, wine and brandy. - We'd like everything! - Right. What did he say? A little! I came looking for Mariola. Ivko's gang and what's-his-name are still here. Come in. Sit down, Sike. - Why those jump? - A lady is present. That's new... Sit down, please. It will be our pleasure. - I just came for my girl. - Sit down! All right! - Would you like some wine? - Have a beer. Cheers. Sike... you're still pretty. But can you still sing as nice as you did in the old days? - Why couldn't I? - Sing for me, then. - Shame on you. - Why? A widow, with a grown daughter, is it proper? Yes, it's proper! If Wolf heard her singing, he would've jumped even higher. Sike, let's hear that one... "I'm a Rose in the Garden Without a Husband." Every party has its fool! I still long for you. Like a wounded deer! Look at her! Shy like a fawn! Mariola! Go home! Good night. Parting is such sweet sorrow, That I shall say good night till it be morrow. Good night. Don't you touch my daughter, you charlatan. Good night... She wanted to be my wife, but... her mother hated me. How about you two? Tired? - Like a dog. - Dead sleepy. - Ivko's gang can't leave. - One more drink, and they'll go. O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard, Being in night, All this is but a dream Too flattering-sweet To be substantial. - Run home! - Mariola! Don't go! Mariola, don't go! - The lad is an actor! - Nice young man... Who is this guy? A vagrant, invited himself. I got my eyes set on her. I felt the same for Sike, Mariola's mother. Her mother hated me. Yet, I could die for her. Kalca, you should be ashamed. You're a merchant's son. On the road, I can sing what I please. Don't urge the horse... - Drive that horse! - Stop! Sike, you're sweet as pie. Don't touch her, no good will come out of this! Take her! I'm not losing my arm for a girl! Sike was very fond of me. But I had my principles. Kalca, you're lying! I can hear you! Is this Kuzman? You were bothering Sike then, same as now. - How come? - You wanted her to sing. Why not? It's our Ivko?s feast! Isn't it so? Lady of the house... you fell asleep! We set you free for the night. Go to sleep. Good night, then. - You're all welcome tomorrow. - We're not going anywhere. It was a busy day today. - Where are you going? - Come here! Sit down! It's your feast. Sit down. Now you're going to see who are your real pals. To our host! Get up! The roosters cried again! Our Fish sings very nice. He has a strong voice. Yes, just like letting a fart go. - You, haberdasher... - Wait a minute. You call this a feast? We haven't had our supper. How come? We had our supper. - I don't recall. - Yes, we did, when Sike was here. That was just a snack! Give us a proper supper! Who wants supper, stand up! - Who's this man? - The host got up first. Not for that! Who the hell are you?! We have supper at home, but it's your feast! All right, but the hostess is asleep. We'll wake her up. No! You'll get to her bed over my dead body! - I'm not giving you the lady! - Which lady? That lady! Our lady of the house! In bed! Let go of the bed and the lady! I'm not letting the lady! No! Who are you to let anybody go?! Let him be, he's drunk! He's drunk as a skunk. Right, my friend? Who the hell is he?! - One of yours? - One of mine?! - What's his name? - I don't know. You were not invited, were you? Invitations are not required for the feast. - Shall we throw him out? - Please leave, sir! To throw a man out from a feast? That is not done. You want to throw him out from your feast? You can't throw a man from a feast. I'm going. Wait! Stop! You're not going anywhere. Come inside. - At your own risk. - Come, or I'll take your shoes off! Resistance is futile. Let him be one of us... a brother. Welcome, brother! My friend... do you have anybody? Father? Mother? Sibling? - No. - How is that? I have no father I have no mother Nobody in the world It's been a long time now since they rest in peace. I have nobody, my brother. No sister to hug her brother. Do you hear this, you quilt-making rack? He has no one, and you're throwing him out. Ivko... where's supper? Here's the kitchen, take what you please. - Go to sleep, you hen! - And I will! You sit down. I'll die for you. That's the way we are. Why don't you go home? Is it proper to have guests from yesterday on the second day? - Proper! - Proper! It's the day of the feast! Who wants red? Who wants white? The shopkeepers are up. It's sunrise. Listen, a nightingale is singing. It was the lark. The herald of the morn. Lark can't sing. Look, love, What envious streaks Do lace the severing Clouds in yonder East. Night's candles are burnt out. And jocund day stands tiptoe On the misty mountain tops. Get inside! I must be gone and live, or stay and die! It's not time to die! Well, mother... They're still here. Did you have some sleep? Not a wink. St. George, help us. Please, come in. Happy second day of the feast. Sorry we couldn't come yesterday. No problem, we celebrate the second day, too. Real Serbs celebrate the third day, too. The third day is already St. Mark's Day. - That's my patron and feast! - Go and prepare. - How will you meet the guests? - Don't you worry about me. Good morning, fair ladies! Happy second day. Don't let Mariola serve those men. Mariola, you'll serve the guests in the other room. You'll be served by Mitance! - Is that so? - So! You quilt-making dog! - Happy second day. - Thank you, Mr. Mayor. - Happy second day, Ivko. - Thank you. This is the Mayor of Ni?? I have references to give him. Mitance, see if these persons want something. - Do you need something? - Yes, we do! - What would you like? - Bring lamb meat. - How much? - Plenty! - Bring wine. - How much? - Ten liters! - Twenty! And beer, too! Why is Ivko being so rude to us? Mariola serves them, and an apprentice is for us. If I were a lifelong friend, I wouldn't tolerate such behavior. He didn't hire you to pick corn. You speak right, my brother! Come, let's embarrass him. - Happy second day. - Please... Where is the host? Ivko! How sweet is love when but Love's shadows are so rich in joy! - Happy second day! - Thank you. - Colonel! - Kalca... Mr. Mayor! You're here, too? I'm sorry... You're embarrassing me! Stay there! My brothers... - Did you see this? - Great shame. We'll sit with your donkey like other beasts of burden. - Like all poor folks. - We're not gentlemen. - Are we all together? - Here's my right hand! What's that drunken talk about poor folks? We don't want to bother you. You have respected guests. Colonels, Mayors, guardsmen, engineers... Here comes the Bishop, too. - Happy feast. - Please come in, Your Holiness. I apologize. This way, Your Holiness. Bless me, Your Holiness! - This way, Your Holiness. - Thank you. Why did Ivko throw you out? - Have you seen this, Mr. Jordan? - Yes! Now we know what kind of man and host he is! Don't deepen my wounds. Are we intruding? Not at all. It's the second day of the feast. Well, I see house cleaning. Some guest spilled wine on the rug. They had a drink or two... - That's normal on a feast day. - Yes, but... The feast has already ended here. Let's go somewhere else. Ivko hired you to beat the rugs? Ibro, my brother, help us! Bring us something to eat, we're starving. - And some drink, too. - I can't. We're going to Ivko?s feast. You have plenty of time. Ivko's feast has just begun! How long do you celebrate this? How long do you celebrate Bayram? - Three-four days. - We're no worse than you! - Please, order a lamb. - And grilled meat! - The Sarajevo way. - And hurry up. Go, call the Gypsies! I want music! It's feast day! Come here, and see disgrace of your household! Excuse me... Some host you are... what's wrong with you? Get out here. It's your feast, and we order food not to starve to death. You could might as well charge us for the drinks. How can you starve when you had two suppers? You keep records? I can't argue now! We even paid the Gypsies. Gypsies?! There is no music on the second day! - Get out of my house! - You're falling deeper! - It's indeed merry here, Ivko. - Yes, it is. Please, help me out. Tell them to go home! You can't chase people away from the feast. Don't you worry much. It's not the end of the world. - Bless you and your feast. - Thank you. - Where are you going? - Good-bye, Ivko. The Bishop said we can't chase people away from the feast. You can chase this lot! They're not people! Kalca! Jovan, you devil! Your wives and children beg you to go home! No use. They have no shame. Now what, Ivko?! My brothers, my friends, my pals... You have respected guests. You don't need Kalca, Fish, Wolf and what's-his-name... You call this goodwill? That's real shameful Serbian hospitality! I'm begging you... please, go home. Your house is opened for three days for the feast! That's a well-known fact! And today is but... Second day. Hear this? Second day, and you already had enough. Music! Go home, child. - Someone may come. - Everybody ran away. Look at her! Look at her! Like a rich jewel In an Ethiop's ear... Beauty too rich for use, For earth too dear! So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows. Child... go home! Oh, unfortunate me! She went... - I shall go, hence... - Go! - It's not possible. - Why?! I don't have my hat. Fish! Kalca! Don't you feel shame in front of your wives and children? Don't touch my wife. She's mine. My children have a father! They won't starve! Shut up! - How's my Capa? - A beast is a beast. Watch your language. Capa is not a beast. - Can we go home? - Go! Go! You too, my wife! What!? Chasing me out!? - Where could I go? - Go to your parents. My parents?! My parents?! I don't want you to watch this disgrace! Come home. Why? We're guest on the feast of our brother Ivko. Look... his wife is getting away. Real shame. Shame on Ivko! He chased her out, like he's chasing us! - Take the children home. - Go home. If I had a wife, I would've... ...went home right away! Let's eat something! I'm starving! Everything is sound asleep. Everything is quiet. Except for Ivkos feast. Our Fish is singing better all the time. Fart is coming out better and better. Here's a guitar, we can sing. - No, let's eat first. - No, let's drink first. Look at the moon, look at the stars. Are there people up there? Yes, there are. - You lie day and night. - Kuzman, you're like a vampire. Come here, let me tell you... there are people up there. There are no people. We're the only people. The ones that stayed, those are real people. People and wolves. Look at these bones... and Capa is not here! Where are you, my dear Capa? Look at these bones! - Where's the host? - He went to bed with the lamb! Ivko! - Where have you been? - Don't shout, you worm! Look at him, he's awake! - I'm wide-awake for two nights! - Come here, you have guests! You're missing a beautiful night of May! You chased everyone out of my house! Guests! Servants! Wife! You'll frenzy my donkey to death! Now you see who hasn't abandoned you. Come down. I'm coming down! - I'll jump! I'll kill myself! - He'll jump. Go ahead, jump. - I'll jump! - He'll jump. Jump! - I'll jump for real! - Jump, so we can all go to sleep! It would be nice if we all went to bed. Ivko as on a brink of a nervous breakdown. Would you do something for me? Anything for you, our brother. - You now I'm crazy about Mariola. - That's clear. Let's go to her house and sing a serenade. We're not a carnival to sing everywhere. - OK. I'll sing solo. - Beware of her mother. - I'll keep you company. - Thank you, my brother. I must admit... I'm crazy about her mother. About Sike? You're suffering. Stop the suffering. But how? Tell me what to do. First, you sing a serenade outside her window. - Then? - First things first. Thank you. You call that a serenade? That's the house of my craftsman Jovca. Was he at Ivko?s feast? I remember I've been there... but Jovca... Bravo! - Who's there? - It's me, Jovan... Fish! - What do you want from Jovca? - To take him to Ivko?s feast. - Jovca is gone. - Where? - He passed away three years ago. - Three years ago? What time is it? - I can't see. - Me neither. Keep it, I'll feel better. - Go to sleep, child. - I'm begging you. - Come in, have a coffee. - And a drink. - Ivko will be mad. - We have to drink for Jovca! For Jovca. Kalca... Capa! Mariola... Mariola! - Mrs. Sike! - Mariola! What do you want? - Love... - Love! That first did prompt us to enquire! Mr. Wolf, shame on you. Fine teacher you are for this lad. He's teaching me. I'm too shy. - I didn't expect that from you. - Mrs. Sike! I'm not shy any more. One more hour to go. Where's my watch? People, my watch is gone! Kalca, my watch is gone. Who's this? Who the hell are you? I'm your brother, my brother! - When did we become brothers? - I can't recall. - Last night. The night before. - Last, or the night before? - Last night or the night before. - Where is my watch? You gave it to a Mrs. Ru?a. Yes, to that old bat Ru?a. Jovca's wife, Ru?a. Jovca... Why should I give her my watch? What's this, my brothers? Requisition? This is the third day that you're in my house! Three days, that's the custom. Bear us one more day, and we'll part like friends. We don't need you, you're free to go. - Who the hell are you? - The lamb! Check if they need any help there. We can't do all by ourselves. Easy! That's better. Ivko, what's this? They're still here? See what they've done to my household? Wolf! You could prepare for us one rooster soup. Kalca! Don't touch that rooster! It wakes me up in the morning! This one has the voice of a herald. He's always surrounded by all the hens from the neighborhood! It will be a good soup, then. No use talking, Ivko. Your job as a host is obviously finished. I'll go fetch Capa. I'll be right back. Come to Ivko's feast! He'll be delighted! Professor... come inside, we have good lamb meat. - No, thank you. - We'll kill a chicken for you. I want to wish you a happy feast. - It's not my feast. - Who's, then? - s. - Where is the host? - He ran away. - From his own feast? This is unheard of. Very interesting case. He ran from his own feast. - Very interesting case. - A real case for an author. Look at Kalca. Sitting with a shotgun, like a local hero. That's my contribution for your book "Serbia, Land and People". - I hope for more. - That's for sure. Get out of the way! The soup is hot! What shall I do with these bandits? It's about time you throw them out. How? - Have you made up your mind? - Of course I did. Then you must use force. What's this?! Every quarter of an hour, you have a meal! Hello, what brings you here? Where are you at my feast? Sit down, have some soup. Woman! Bring a dish for Ivko! Woman? Where's my wife? Woman! She sits at home, like a real housewife should. - Where is she, then? - At her house! - Who's house is this? - Mine, who else? This? Your house? - Where is my house, then? - In your alley! Too much drink is killing you. Have some sleep. - That was just a joke. - No one jokes with my house. - I grant you, it's your house. - Yes! - I'll defend it with a gun! - It's yours. I came to invite all of you to my house, to eat and drink. Sit down! I'm not like Ivko, to chase guests from the feast! - Please, my brother, just one word. - Don't ask! I'm not chasing you away, but don't snatch my guests! Sit down. Let's finish the soup. - Get away, nothing's happening. - We want to see the fight. - There won't be a fight. - Yes, there will. You called the band? - Who the hell are you? - My father's son. I can't recall. You're not Capa's? - I don't know the gentleman. - Start playing! - What do you want to hear? - Wolf, what was that song? - "Insomnia". - That's the most expensive one. Kalca never buys cheap. Let's hear it! Ivko, come here. Have some wine. I don't drink. It's your feast. Come, drink with real men. I don't... - Bravo! - Music! Go away! Haven't you had enough?! You came, you ate, you drank! You had your dinner! Supper! You had your breakfast! You drank! You slept! You shot my chicken! You demolished my house! What more do you want?! Don't you have Christian mercy?! Get out of my house! Get out of my house! There he goes again! His house! Our folks kept the feast custom for 500 years under the Turks! - Now, Ivko wants to destroy it! - I'll kill him! Give me the gun! - They'll ask, who killed him? - Kalca, his brother! - Like a dog! - Faithless! St. George... My former brothers! The police will drive you out! I'll be your and my shame! I dont want to waste gunpowder. I'll set my Capa on you! Go to the Town Hall. There's no other way. I'm coming back with the police! Run, Ivko! Don't you come in this yard! You'll get killed! Ivko! I'm sorry, I couldn't make it to your feast. Don't be angry. Why should I be angry? - Next year, we'll make it all up. - I'm looking forward to it. - Why that long face? - You're tearing my coat. I'm sorry. Next year, watch out. When I start, I can't quit. No problem. I'm not rid of this year's guests, he's talking about next year. Ivko, don't say that. I'm your best friend! EVERYBODY IS AT IVKO'S FEAST EXCEPT ME Ivko, it's you. Poor Ivko, what has struck you... Mayor... - Poor Ivko is here. - Let him in. I know, Mr. Ivko just came in here. Don't you worry, we'll fix everything. What's going on in your house? Who's there? - Wolf, Fish and Kalca! - Nice company. - They're still there? - I can't stand that burden! I'm sorry. Jordan called the police for protection. - Look. He sued you. - I don't care about him! Did you try to tell them, 'Brothers, please go home'? They're drunk and mad! Kalca tried to shoot me! Enough! Nothing's on fire. Call the clerk. I'll use my head and deal with them. No trouble. You're in a tough spot, but you had it coming to you. I made some practical jokes, but not like the four of them! - Who is the fourth? - Some tramp, scoundrel. - Nobody knows who he is. - Wait for me here. My clerk will give you later the keys of your empty house. With God's help. - You really called the police? - He had no choice. Wait here. Look who's here! Welcome, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor... What's going on here?! - See what he has done to us? - Who's "he"? Our brother, Ivko. Please, sit down. That's not the way to organize a feast. We're left all alone here. Like orphans without a father. Like chicken, when a hawk snatches the hen. That's not right. I loved him like my Capa... - Ivko can't stand this any more! - Did someone get hurt? I see you're slaying the lambs. - We got tired of chicken. - We were not alone. We had company. Tell me... how much can you get for a lamb pelt? Five or six pennies per pelt. Wash the glasses, I'll go fetch the wine. - What are your cutting? - Lamb, Mr. Mayor. St. George's! The best! - Bring a chair for the Mayor. - Absolutely not! I'm here on official business. I can take a peace of meat, but I won't sit down. - One should eat this standing. - We'll attack this one, now! Everybody had something to eat. Please, have some wine. Wine? Absolutely not! I drink it only with soda. We know what the Mayor drinks like all law-abiding citizens. - All right, but just one. - Why just one? We have plenty. You're not cutting it right. Remember... you put the lamb on the table in one piece. Then you pluck it with your fingers. There's nothing better. Give me the knife. The Lord sent him here. We started to loose it. Warm up the dishes by the fire. That's how you eat meat. It's not good when it's cold. Some people like it cold, though. I like it both ways. Educated man, he knows things. It's easy to put it on fire. You have to cut it right. Like my father used to say: "The school is everything." Only an educated man can save Serbia! Sit down, help yourselves. I'll take just a piece of kidney... Delicious... - Some more wine and soda. - No problem. - Is this genuine soda? - Genuine. - Ivko drinks only the real thing. - That's good. This is how you eat ribs. - Take this piece, too. - And this. You should eat the head. You're the head of this town. - What happened? - It's tough. Did he drive them out? Not yet. He's teaching them a lesson. Is he teaching them a real lesson? A real lesson. Mr. Mayor! Allow me to make a mix of wine and soda for you. - Thank you. Who are you? - Nobody knows. He appeared like a stray cat. Now he won't leave. Allow me to introduce myself. Svetislav Ilic. Former actor, member of the theatre company. Dismissed county clerk, victim of the new administration. Leave the politics, make me a mix. I started as a bit-player. Just one line... "Have mercy! He's innocent!" Later I played Jovan, and then Boldrick. The audience awarded me with applause. They adored me! I remember now. I got a letter from Belgrade about you. That's why I came. I will show you my references. Not now. I'm among friends. This is private business. I know how you feel. I always have trouble with them. - I'll buy you one more drink. - Bring me one more soda. Ivko! Come here! Now! - Don't shout. - I want us to greet like men. Let's go. What would you say if Ivko stayed so long at your place? It wouldn't be the first time. My patron's feast is tomorrow. St. Mark's Day. He's welcome. You, too. Where is your head? Today is St. Mark's Day. - Today? - Yes. I know that my feast is two days after St. George's Day. - That was two days ago. - No. Yesterday, we... - People! What day is today? - St. Mark's Day! My brother! Happy feast, my brother! Wolf is celebrating his feast in someone else's house! Let's have a drink! This is a completely different situation. Svetislav... take my hat and the cane. Happy feast! Mr. Mayor, thank you, and welcome! Let's have a drink. That's a vain hope. - The Mayor won't help you. - Why is that? The Mayor is known for his merry nature. A musician told me once he is the heaviest drinker in town. Don't say that. He is a reasonable man. I remember his drinking sprees. Cheers. Mr. Mayor... There she is. Look at her, please. I see now what you mean. I'll be your best man. This is getting serious! Mariola! My beauty! You will take tomorrow half of your pay as my clerk. - How much is that? - That's 48 dinars. - Thank you! - Everything is going well! Ivko's feast is over, Wolf's feast is starting! It's not a proper feast without music. Tell that clerk to find a music band. Tell them to bring fireworks! Happy feast. Hopefully, next year you'll have a wife. You don't have to be lonely like a wolf. What's wrong? Nothing... Another feast without a wife. Not even in my own house. We'll find you someone, don't you worry! Cheers. Svetislav came only yesterday, and he has everything. And I... I'm tired of living all alone. Mr. Mayor... What's wrong? My feast, in someone else's house! - We'll make all arrangements. - We'll take care of everything. The band is on their way. And the dancers, too! What's this? Ivko?s still feasting? Mr. Ivko, bravo! Woman, when will this end? I didn't know Ni? had so many musicians. Is there no law and order in this country?! I left Kalca with a shotgun and I find fireworks! - My brother! - Come here! - Band! Let's hear one for me! - No, one for the Mayor. There's no song about wine and soda. - Yes, there is! - Let's hear it. A Gypsy kingdom in our own yard. The feast started with Gypsies, it will end with Gypsies. Ivko, come here! Don't you know today is our Wolf's feast? It's my feast today! St. Mark's Day! It's a shame you forgot about your brother! Happy feast! I wish you celebrate next year in your house! Bring a glass for our new guest! Sit down. You can't live without us. Say it's true! It's true. You went astray, but finally got reunited with your old pals. Look at these "bad" citizens. Each of them has a heart of gold. You can help us out. - It's your neck. - Anything, Mr. Mayor. Svetislav... sit down. Svetislav is my new clerk. - You know that girl is dear to his heart. - Mariola? You can have these people for another three days in your house. Or, you can go and ask if the maiden is apt for marriage. Because we have a right groom for her. Out of the way! That's Ivko's feast, Your Majesty. That's it... I heard something. It's nice! Your Majesty... Your Majesty... it's an honor to have you at my feast. - You are that... Ivko? - I am Ivko. I don't understand. Mayor? Ivko's friends came for his feast, on St. George's Day. - Today is St. Mark's day. - They overdid it a little. - A little. - A little? A little too much. They are celebrating the freedom you gave them. Long live the King! The liberator of our country! Nice... now everybody please go home. I already made arrangements to find a bride for my new clerk. This will be a good ending for the feast. - Mr. Ivko, are you going? - Right away, Your Majesty! Capa... what a dog this is! Real class! Kalca, when shall we go hunting again? As soon as I get rid of this Ivko's feast, Your Majesty. I take you at your word. Well, gentlemen... good-bye. So, Kalca is lying?! Where is that Kuzman?! Mr. Mayor, I'll go. Say that he is a government employee, and I guarantee for him. If she says "no", he'll be devastated. Silence! - That wretched word, "no"! - Don't mind him. You don't know what my heart feels! Calm down, or I'll send you to Belgrade, to a madhouse! What is life without her, but mere hell. I'll kill myself! - Ivko, say he'll hang himself! - I understand. He went out of his mind! Get back as soon as possible, if you want your house cleared. I'll do my best! Our brother is really something! Your house was not enough? You had to come here? Sike, you are a reasonable woman. Please, don't make fun of a poor woman. This is no joke. The Mayor will come, too. The Mayor? The lad is fine, nice, handsome, tall. And he's well mannered. The Mayor insisted to ask the girl first. Is your maiden apt for marriage? Yes, she is. Ask Mariola now. Mariola, come here! Mariola... how do you feel about that... lad? She's shy, like a widow's daughter should. She's shy. Speak freely, my child. He caught my eye right away. I didn't know about this catching of eye! I noticed the way she looked at him. Congratulations! Mr. Mayor, guess what? What? - We've done it! - Everything's settled! My brother! You'll be mine! Shall we go? Kalca, take five or six musicians with you. Dismiss the rest. You're paying the expenses now. - What are you looking for? - My hat! How about me?! - Look at this... - Mr. Mayor... I beg you. You're like a father to me. - Please, arrange my wedding, too. - Just point your finger. Mr. Mayor... Mrs. Sike? No problem. Let's go! Svetislav has no hat! - Where's mine? - He didn't come bareheaded. Like that man said: "Where was his head?" - I can't find it. - We won't wait forever. Where did you get that hat? Give it to him. It doesn't suit you, anyway. - What am I to do? - Find his! Let's go! The hat is on the roof! - Ivko, lead the way! - Music! Mariola, go make coffee for our guests. Mrs. Sike, you really mourned your late husband... Tance. He deserves more mourning... But it won't bring him from the dead. God bless the living. It would be a shame for you, so young, to abandon life. Like a mountain flower. No one to pick it up, no one to feel the fragrance. - Svetislav, go find your bride. - Yes, sir. - Why do you speak like this? - Come on, let's hear you! Mrs. Sike... I... Let's hear it! Did you see this? Sike, you heartless woman, the man is dying for you! - No more fooling around. - Mariola, do you love me? Let me go. I won't let you go 'till I die, my love. I'll take him! Like a hungry wolf, our Wolf snatched the most beautiful lamb. Our tiny Sike. He came to Ni? and was silent, and then he hurt my heart. I wish you all the best. - You'll get your hat tomorrow. - Thank you, my father. I ordered a coach for you. Go straight home. I'll patrol the streets myself, to check if you kept your word. Don't you worry, Mr. Mayor! Go! - Svetislav, go straight home! - Yes, Mother! Goodnight, Mariola! Goodnight, Mother! - Sike, I'll go home, too! - I hope so. God willing. Where to, now? It's not right to wake our families at this hour. Out of town, because of the Mayor. I know a place in Kutina. Driver... to Kutina! - What is it, Capa? - He wants to say something? Say it, Capa. The Mayor received a telegram from Kutina. Four men are held there in custody. Capa is leading the way. Capa shifted from a supporting role to a protagonist. Is that you? Ivko! Wait a minute. This is finally the end of the feast, yes? Let us finish the story. Everything was done according to the arrangement. Svetislav and Mariola got married on Pentecost. Wolf and Sike also wed on St. Pauls Day. Their ceremony was smaller, due to her second marriage. - Look! The gold coin didn't sink! - This is what I call good beer. ?or?e, come here. Sike, give him to me. Don't teach the child to be a drunkard. Like his father. ?or?e, you're so heavy... You're growing strong! Our unfulfilled Hamlet has buried his talent. But, whenever he sees a theatre poster... ...his actors blood starts to boil. Joan, the heiress of lord Talbot hath betrayed me for that rout! I'm not Joan, you devil! Svetislav! God help my daughter. And I loved her so! That's no way to behave in public. - I apologize. - Make a fool of yourself at home. Good morning, Mr. Mayor. Ivko... St. George's Day is near. When is that? St. ?ivko's Day. That's my feast. Forget about that St. George's Day. - Never again. - Shut up, you ill tempered fool. Look how many children became out of your St. George. - St. George is a good saint. - Like I said: Never again. - Don't speak like that. - He's a good saint. He slayed the dragon with a spear, they say. Every icon shows this... Writer... there you are... - I'll see you in court! - So many shameful lies! I just wanted to preserve a merry picture of Ni? from oblivion. A picture of one St. George's Day... ...how a mother and a daughter found their love ones... ...how their children came to be. - Let's go home! - Just a little longer, please. Or else, these happy days will be flown away by the river... ...and they will never return again. Just as our youth.
