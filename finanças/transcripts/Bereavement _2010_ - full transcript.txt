(wind whistling) (birds calling) (door creaks) Hey, he's right here. Woman: I've only read about it. I know it's extremely rare. So he can't feel or touch? No, he responds to normal touch and pressure. His body just can't recognize sensations of pain. CIPA is a very dangerous condition. He could bite his own tongue off and not even realize it. He could break a bone and keep on playing. Even hot foods have to be checked before he eats them. Of course. He has to be checked hourly for cuts and bruises, and not just his arms and legs, but his whole body, even inside his mouth. This is very important. Martin can't tell when something hurts. Hi there. I bought this new bike for my nephew's birthday, but he doesn't like the color. Can you believe that? I was gonna just throw it out when I saw you and I thought, "There's a kid who'd probably love a new bike." Am I right? It's right in my truck. Want to take a look? Do you like red? It's difficult and exhausting. I've been through two aides already. You don't have to worry, Mrs. Bristol. Whatever you need, I'm here. Would you like to meet him now? - Yes, please. - Okay. Mrs. Bristol: Oh my God. Martin! Martin! (distant dog barking) (rain pattering) (thunder crashing) (man grunting) (woman sobbing) Don't be afraid. It doesn't have any feelings. (woman gasps, sobbing) It doesn't hurt, see? (woman screams) (woman screaming) (continues screaming) No! It'll be over soon. (woman screaming) - (woman screaming) - (thunder rumbling) (thunder crashing) (birds chirping) (music playing on radio) (car door shutting) It's good to see you. How are you holding up? Okay. You know, you were here once before. You were about that big. Remember? Not really. So that's everything? Yeah. Okay. (music playing) “If I could see” “Beyond this moment“ “I'd hope to see you” “Looking...“ How long do I have to give up my room? Well, just until your father finishes remodeling the den. I'll be in college. They're here! Now remember, calm and compassionate. No, Wen-- Wendy. Hi. She's an only child. - Hi! - Hi. - Do you like mice? - No. - How about snakes? - No. I can do a cartwheel. Want to see? Oh, Allison, look at you. - Oh. - (Wendy chattering) Mom, get out of the way! You didn't tell me how pretty she is. My side of the family. - You must be starving. - Not really. Come on, Randy. This dog is always under my feet. Come on in. - Hey, Dad, need some help? - Yeah, I could use a hand. Mom, Dad needs some help. Do you really get up at 4:00 every morning? When I'm in training, yeah. Can't you use a treadmill? Dad's got one. He hangs his shirts on it. Wendy. Allison: I run distance. This is my room, or was My room. Now you'll be sleeping here just... until Jonathan finishes remodeling the den. You didn't have to do that. (squeaking) Whiskers, how did you get out of there? You naughty little boy. We'll be having supper in just a few minutes. If you need anything, just give a shout. This is your home too now. She's really taking it hard. Well, what do you expect? Her whole life's been turned upside down overnight. (music playing over radio) Hey, Melissa, are you leaving already? Yeah. Hey, can you cover my shift tomorrow? I have exams. I know. I have to take Jesse to the doctor again. How about Danielle? I asked her already. Yeah, okay. - Thank you, sweetie. - No problem. (heavy rain) (honks horn) Hey, you're blocking my car. (punch) (yelps) (doors slam) (thunder rumbling) (grunting) (Melissa moaning) (Melissa crying) No. No, wait, please. No no, please. What are you doing? Are you crazy? No. Ow. Ow. (screaming) Help! Ow. Ow. Please. Help! (screaming, sobbing) Door slams. (distant train horn blowing) (Melissa crying) Help. Woman: It's no use. Who's there? Hello? We're gonna die down here. No. No, we're gonna get out of here. What day is it? (screaming) (shrieking) (panting) Curiosity killed the cat. (distant train horn blaring) (rock music playing on radio) (truck approaching) - (horn blowing) - (gasps) (grunts) Ow. Whoa. - Are you all right? - 1 think SO. They wouldn't brake for the pope on this road. Yeah, I see that. Your-- your arm is bleeding. You want to come inside? You can wash up. It's nothing. Oh shit. - Are you sure you're all right? - Yeah, it's just my leg. You want me to give you a ride home? No, it's okay, really. It's not a big deal, just a couple miles up the street. How do you know? Small town. Come on. What are neighbors for? A few miles? That's hardly neighbors. Around here that's a next-door neighbor. Okay, sure. All right, I'll be right back. Ow. Uh, I think I'm just gonna walk. Are you afraid? I'm not afraid. Great. Then get on. What's your name? - Allison. - William. Slow down. I've never been on one of these things before. After my accident the doctor said I'd never ride again. I'm kidding. So where are you from? Chicago. I was there once. What brings you to this armpit? I came to live with my uncle. A problem with the parents? Family issues? Yeah. You too, huh? What kind of problems? They're dead. Shit, I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. Thanks for the ride. Keep it. You need it. Man on radio: Still no leads in the disappearance of college student Melissa Barnes who was last seen leaving her place of employment at the Charcoal Diner... Hey, how was your run? Interesting. (thunder rumbling, crashing) Woman: Melissa, I-- 1 think my hand is coming loose. (door opens) He's coming. Don't make a sound. We're gonna get out of here. Man: When steer are led to slaughter, they smell the stench of fear and blood and they panic. Sometimes we'd have to saw off their hind legs so they couldn't run. No. No, please. Woman: No. No. Oh God! - (knife tears flesh) - (woman screaming) Man: Hold her still. (woman continues screaming) Man: Get back here. (woman continues screaming) (panting) It's okay. Everything's under control. Looks like I got here just in time. (screaming) When something outlasts its usefulness, it gets discarded. (lock clicks) (thunder crashing) (hissing) Still here? (distant train horn blaring) - See you later. - Yeah. - Bye. - Bye. (clicks tongue) Are you sure you're all right? Yeah, gotta get it over with sooner or later. She'll be fine. Nervous? You think they'll have a decent track team? Don't get your hopes up. No chance of that. What is that place? That's the Sutter plant. It's been closed for years. I saw someone there yesterday while I was jogging-- a boy. A boy? Yeah, I thought so. Probably just some kids vandalizing the place. I kind of wish you'd stay away from there and jog on the main road. Yeah, and get hit by a truck. Graham's a pack rat. That place should be condemned. Someone lives there? Yeah, he stays mostly to himself. You know him? We're about the same age. He never went to school. His dad made him work at that place day and night. It was a meat-packing plant till they couldn't afford to upgrade the equipment to code. I'll tell you one thing: I don't miss the smell. I'll pick you up at 2:30. Silence is a sound of no fear... no pain... the sound of peace. (grunts) I envy your serenity. The path to redemption begins with forgiveness-- absolution. You're my witness. What did I tell you? I told you don't touch, didn't I? William: Yeah, the bolts are stripped. Cashier: $17.50. - Can I owe you the 50 cents? - Yeah, right. William: Thanks, Eddie. Jonathan, how's that extension coming? It's going really good. (engine starts) You know you've got drywall nails here? Hmm? Oh shit. Just cheer-leading. Unless you can kick a field goal. That's it? There isn't much of a demand for girls' sports in this area. Our cheer-leading squad did win Best Routine in the state final last year. (sighs) (girls cheering) Come on! Whoo-hoo! Yeah! Girl: Ready? (girls chanting) Let's shake it. Let's shout it. PHS! Let's shake it. Let's shout it. PHS! Let's shake it. Let's shout it. Aren't you scared of that falling and crushing you? How's your leg? Oh, it's better. So this is what you do-- fix cars? Guidance counselor told me my aptitude tests said either medical school or auto mechanic. I can't stand the sight of blood, so... Okay, well, I don't want to bother you, So... Hey. Yeah? Are you busy later? Um, I was gonna go home and stare at the ceiling until I fell asleep. Why? Well, I was-- I was wondering if maybe you wanted to-- Man: Billy! Excuse me. - Billy! - Dad? In here. - Christ. - God. I dropped the fucking remote. Be careful. - Ow, Jesus! - Sorry, Dad. - Oh man. - You're dead weight. Yeah, well, I'm not dead yet. - Oh. - Can I help? - Father: Just-- just lift me up. - Yeah, just hold his chair. - Okay. - Come on, just put me back on my chair. (grunts) You got it. - Allison: Here. (both men grunt) - Allison: Okay. - You could have hurt yourself. What do you mean, could have? (groans) - Thank you. - Yeah. Um, Dad, this is Allison. Allison, this is my dad. - Allison: Hi. - She's from Chicago. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - From Chicago? - Yeah. I hate Chicago. - Hey, at least you're not gay, right? - Dad. You know, he spends most of the time alone in his room, - doing who knows what. - Yeah, you should talk. Yeah, but it's about the only thing I've got left. Um, I should probably go. William: No, stay. No, it's getting late. I really have to get home. William: He's not normally like this. He's usually much worse. Well, maybe you should give him the helmet. Bye. (door opens, closes) What the hell is the matter with you? Can't she take a joke? Hey, come on. Hey, toss me my cigarettes. Hey, what--? Now what am I supposed to do? (scrubbing) What's your name? Hello? Can you answer me, please? Graham: If they have no feelings, they can't know fear. But if they can't know fear... why do they run? Let me go. All clean? Come here. What are you doing? Give me your arm. Don't. Run! He doesn't understand. Can't you see? Stop it. Stop it! His conscience is unburdened. You're crazy! Is yours? Let me go! You're fucking crazy! Let me go! Oh God. Where were you? Um, I'm sorry. You're sorry? Jonathan. I thought we said 2:30. I left early. We were beginning to worry. Well, I said I'm sorry. Let's not make it a habit. - Okay? - Okay. You've been to Paris? Yeah, a few times. Wow, you've been to so many cool places. Yeah, my dad used to turn all of his business trips into family vacations. He was great like that. I've never been anywhere. Well, maybe someday you can go to Chicago with me. - Tomorrow? - No. (knocks on door) Hi guys. Wendy. Can I borrow your camera? Yeah, there's a few more pictures left. You can finish the roll if you want. - (camera shutter clicks) - Dad, can we go to France? Sure. I'll cash in some stock options. See what I mean? How about Pittsburgh, huh? Wendy: How much longer do I have to give up my room? Jonathan: Not much longer. Wendy: Don't you think Whiskers needs a bigger cage? Jonathan: I think that cage is just fine. Do you think Allison's happy here? I hope so. I don't think she likes me. How could somebody not like you? - I know, right? - Right. (chuckles) You know, I'm-- I-- I-- I'm feeling-- feeling something. I'm feeling a little-- I'm feeling a little hungry. (Wendy giggling) Oh no. - I need a pillow sandwich. - (squeals, giggling) (imitates chewing) Hello. Can you talk? I can help you. You've just got to help me get loose first. Please. Help me. I've done everything you've asked me. You could make it stop. (heart beating) (whimpering) (screams) God damn it! (whimpering) (screaming) (Melissa screaming) (flesh rips) (continues screaming) (continues screaming) Now they can't trust you. You're gonna have to make it up to them somehow. They take advantage of vulnerability and weakness. Bury it. The furnace needs scrubbing. Graham: You caused all this. Be good, sweetie. I will. Whiskers, no. Theories on our emotional development are divided into two schools of thought-- whether we're products of genetics predisposed to exhibit certain behavioral patterns, or products of our environment. Evolutionary biologists believe that our inherited genes are what determine development. Opponents argue that our individuality is directly influenced by the patterns of behavior that we see and hear every day. In other words, a child raised in a loving environment will respond to the world in a much different way than a child raised in fear or taught to hate. Our children are in essence mirror images of ourselves-- our beliefs, our ideologies, our conscience-- ground control to Major Tom-- which brings us to psychotherapy-- the psychoanalytic theory of personality. This will be on the test, people. Hey, need a ride? Uh, I don't know. Come on, get in. Take a break. Have some fun. Are you starting your own pharmacy? I get headaches. I can't stay out late. Don't worry. I'll have you back by Monday. Yeah, I restored it piece by piece. I thought about opening my own body shop one day, but... Why don't you? Um, well, my dad-- he's not so good on his own. So how far do you run anyway? Five, six miles. I would have a heart attack. Yeah. These will give you a heart attack. I guess you never eat junk like this, huh? I'm not in training right now. Yeah, me neither. (insects chirping) (engine starts) So do you have any brothers or sisters? Just me and my dad. My mom died a couple of years ago-- pneumonia. Has he always been, um--? Yeah, he used to work construction. He lost the use of his legs in an accident in Chicago, actually. My father always wanted a boy. He was a track star and just missed qualifying for the Olympics in '76. He tried to correct that failure through me. They were driving home from dinner just a mile from the house and... an SUV blew a stop sign. It's funny how everything can change in an instant. A stranger can come along and in the blink of an eye just destroy everything. So you came to live with your uncle? I have a grandmother who lives in New York, but she's agoraphobic, a real freak show, So... it was her or my uncle. I bet you wish you went to New York now, huh? I hate New York. (truck approaching) Out of the car, Allison. - What? - You heard me. - I'm not going anywhere. - Yeah, back off, man. You shut your mouth! Come on. - What are you doing? - I'm taking you home. Allison. Your mother and father worked hard so you could be somebody. I'm not gonna let you derail that by hanging out with that trailer trash. You don't even know him. I know that kid better than you ever will. If your father was here-- Look, sports, college-- that whole thing-- that was my father's dream, not mine. I never wanted any of it. Well, what do you want? Do you want to live in the back of a... truck? Do you want to collect welfare? You think I wanted to come here? You think I wanted to come and live with you? My brother and 1 made a promise along time ago: Should something happen to either of us, we'd be there for each other's kids. It's not one you ever expect to have to keep, and I'm not going back on my word, but it's your life. You want to try it out on your own, go ahead. You want me to get out? I want you to make a choice. Okay, well, we'll do things my way for a while, just as long as we understand each other. (sniffling) (door squeaks) (sobbing) Woman: Oh no. No. I haven't done anything. I haven't done anything. Please. Graham: Like I showed you. Woman: Why are you doing this? How frightening when it's our own flesh. Woman: No! No, stop. Graham: Hold her still. Woman: No. - Graham: Do it! - Please, please. - I don't think your heart's in this. - No. No. (screaming) (woman continues screaming) (Martin gasping, coughing) Come on. Come on. I'm not afraid of you anymore. This is my house. I'm not gonna be like you-- condemned. I'm fixing what you broke! Go back to hell where your bed is made. This is my house! (panting) (panting) (hammer pounding) - My dad trusted me. - Jonathan will too. You just have to give him a chance. Besides, it's not you he doesn't trust. I can take care of myself. LI know you can. He's just trying to look out for you. Please. (sighs) What's he got against William anyway? Oh, we've known Billy since he was this high. He's had to deal with more than his share of problems. That's not his fault. I mean, I think it's wonderful how he takes care of his father, especially after what happened to his mother. Well, she did that to herself. You can't give yourself pneumonia. She didn't die of pneumonia. Billy's mother-- she killed herself. What? Hung herself in the garage. Billy was the one who found her. It was really hard on him. The doctors put him on all sorts of medication. He's gotten in a lot of trouble around town. I think Jonathan's just afraid he's a little unstable. And his father-- well-- Where are you going? I need to sort things out in my head. Hey, Allison, you want to play a game? Maybe later, okay? Where are you going? (sad music playing) (gunshot) (woman screams) Hi. Hi. Can I talk to you? There's nothing to talk about. (door opens) I came to apologize for last night. Not your fault. He's probably right. Whatever happened in the past doesn't matter. Nothing happened. Let's start with no more lies, okay? What are you talking about? I know. About your mother. You do, huh? And those pills aren't for headaches. What do you know? I know how hard it is to lose someone. I know that your mother wouldn't want you to feel responsible for her death. Hey! What the hell are you talking shit to my son for? Dad. Who the hell do you think you are? Dad, shut up. You're talking about his mother, that bitch? Don't. All she did was abandon us. She never gave a shit about you. Not now. This is my house, I'll say whatever the hell I want. Dad. What, I'm supposed to hold my tongue so some piece of ass won't get offended? Why do you always gotta be such an asshole? They always leave, just when you need them the most. Allison! Why, dad? Does it make you feel better to humiliate me like that? Good riddance. One of these days, you're gonna push me too far and then where will you be? Who will take care of you when I'm gone? You wanna go? Then go! Get lost! Get out of here! (crying) Hello? No, wait. (car motor) (flies buzzing) (music playing) (panting) (door opening) (music playing) Hello? Hey, are you okay? Wait. Are you okay? Are you in trouble? What are you doing down here? (door creaking) Are you in here? (quietly) Oh my God. Martin. (rattling) Hello? Are you down here? (car driving) Where are you? (Allison gasps) Wait. Come back. I'm not going to hurt you. I want to help you. Is your name Martin? Here, come with me. You can't stay here. It's not Safe. What's wrong? You don't have to be afraid. You can trust me. You shouldn't be down here. (Allison screaming) No! No! No! No! No! (screaming) (panting) Good work. - I'm sure she's fine. - How? She's just blowing off some steam. No 17-year-old wants to be told what to do. Not yet. I don't have any brothers or sisters 'cause Dad's lazy. And now he's chased her away too. Way to go, Dad. (crickets chirping) (rat squeaking) (screaming) (screaming continues) (distant train horn blowing) She never came home last night. I know. Where are you going? I'm gonna go find her. I need to speak to Allison. She's not here. It's important. - She isn't here, Billy. - We thought she was with you. No. Well she was, but- What happened? We had a fight. Oh Jesus. I thought she went home. Oh, God. She's been gone all night? Since yesterday. This is your goddamn fault. - Stop. Jonathan. - Stay the hell away from her. - Jonathan. - Don't push me. - Jonathan. - You're no good. You're just like your old man-- good for nothing. It's okay. Stay away from my niece! (car drives away) (Allison whimpering) Please. If they have no feelings, they can't know fear. But if they can't know fear... (Allison gasping) then why do they run? Anybody home? Please don't. Sutter! Uncle Jay! (whimpering) (knocks) (muffled screaming) Hello? (knocking) (muffled screams) Who's there? It's Jonathan Miller. I'm looking for my niece. She didn't come home last night. I've been looking all over for her. I thought she might have wandered over here. Have you seen her? No. (Allison screaming) Listen, do you have a young boy living over here? She said she saw a boy running around over here. Just get off my property. You mind if I come in a moment? I'm busy. Just a moment. Just a second. Uncle Jay! Allison? (gunshot) Uncle Jay! What did you do? You girls, you-- you never can keep your mouths shut. (screaming) No! No! (continues screaming) No. No. - (grunting) - (screaming) No. No. (continues screaming) No! No. (screaming) Leave me alone! (sobbing) (screaming) (motorcycle) Screaming (screams) (banging on glass) William: Hello? Allison? Mr. Miller? William: Hello? (water dripping) (screaming) Oh my god! Martin! Help me! Open the door! Come back! Help! Let me out, Martin! Allison? Hello? Allison! Allison! (knocking on door) I can't hear you! William! Open the door! It's locked! Hurry! (chains clinking) Turn around, please! Turn around! I'm gonna get you out of here I promise, its okay! I got it! Turn around! (smash!) (screaming continues) (chopping) No! (music) (crying) (panting) Forget it. Leave me alone! I don't care! Let them find out. I won't do it. I can't. You leave him alone. He hasn't done anything! No! No I need him! Who's gonna help me clean up? You know I can't stand it. No! Shut up! Shut up! (screaming) You're no better than he was! (smashing) (axe clinks) You promised me! I did everything you said! (crying) You win. You're wrong. He wouldn't dare. Don't look at me like that. You don't ask why. You just do. That's just the way it is. Do you think you owe me? That maybe I should grow eyes in the back of my head? They abandoned you. What would you be without me? Do you feel guilty or something? Don't feel guilty. A child shouldn't feel guilty about nothing. You... you don't feel anything, do ya? Guilt, pain, regret, nothing, do ya? Who are you to judge me? (stab) You have no soul to redeem. Do you? Don't try anything funny while I'm gone. They're watching. (door closes) (banging, panting) (door opens) Oh my God. What did he do to you? I'm gonna get you out of here. I'm sorry. (crying) (clink) You'll be okay. (panting, crying) C'mon. Come on, it's okay. 1... can't carry you. Is this what you're scared of? This thing? (kick) (loud crash) You see? It's nothing. When are they coming home? Soon. (knock on door) Finally. (door opens) Yes? (scary music) (screaming) Wendy, run! (screaming) Mommy! (slam) (screaming) (loud crash) (hysterical screaming) (struggling) (screaming) (struggling, punching) Mommy! Wendy, run! Run! (struggling) (door slam, heavy breathing, sobbing) (loud gasp) No, please don't! Have to. (stab) (shrieking) We're almost there. (dragging) (heavy breathing) Jonathan. (match strike) (fire burning) (clink) No. (ominous music) It's gonna be ok. I'm gonna get you home. (whimpering) (scratching noise) (turning knob slowly) (door opens) Randy! Oh, Randy! (scary music) (scream) (door slam) (whimpering) (door rattling) (banging on door) It's going to be ok. (door kicked open) (scream) (dog whimpering) Please! Don't hurt my animals. (knife drops on floor) No... Ate from my hand. Trusted me. Even at the end. (sobbing) Unconditional. He... He made me! (smashing) Mommy! (panting) I'm making things right. Lowe them that much. With each one. Another sin is forgiven. I... can't let it happen again. Not like me. You understand... Don't ya? Not like that boy. Worthless. (fire raging) (scream) Karen? Karen... Don't... ...let him get her. I can't stop now. There's still so much more to do. You... you come with me. Come with me. No. Please, come with me. Help me. Help me redeem myself! No! Let her go you son of a bitch! (stab) (grunt in pain) (stab) (loud cry in pain) (screaming) It does... I'm sorry. (stumbling, grunting) It's ok. It's me, it's just me. Where's Mommy? She's downstairs. (stumbling down stairs) (loud thud) I need you to stay here. Alright? Why? Just please do as I say. Ok? Don't leave! I'm not leaving, just stay here. (soft whimpering) (coughing) (fire raging) (loud scream) Martin? Oh no! (clink) (dialing) Martin! (police) 911, what is your emergency? Yes, hello? (stab) (shrieking in pain) (loud thud) (screaming) (scary music) (crying in pain) (slicing sound) (stab) (shrieking in pain) (stabbing and screaming) (stabbing) (soft gasping) (soft whimpering) Allison? (screaming) (ominous music) (fire raging) (coughing) (stumble and fall) (coughing) (stomping up stairs) (door crashes open) (coughing, grunting) Boy? (slow heartbeat sound) (climbing stairs) (stumble) (spit) (slow heartbeat sound) (climbing steps) I understand now. Why they run. Cause even a dumb animal. Knows when it's been betrayed. (footsteps) Do you feel betrayed? No... That's why you didn't run. Cause you knew you had it coming! (soft footsteps on stairs) You... You never ran. (ominous music) My boy. (music builds) (ax slicing) (thud) Thank you. (ax slicing) (grunting, screaming) (ax slicing) (screaming) (ax slicing) (guttural moan) (ax slicing) (gurgling) (ax slicing) (sputtering, coughing) (gasping) (music softens) (very sad piano music playing) We counted four bodies any idea what caused it? Tough to say. A stove left on. A cigarette left burning. Probably got trapped. Tried to call for help. But the flames consumed them. Yeah. (dog whimpering) Billy? (knock on door) Billy? (door opens) (bottle rattling Billy? Billy? (bottles rattling) (ominous music) (hammering) (hammering) (ominous music swells) (cold wind blowing) (music playing) (ominous tone) Help! (ominous tone) (chimes tinkling) (knocking) Hello? Is anybody here? Can you help me?
