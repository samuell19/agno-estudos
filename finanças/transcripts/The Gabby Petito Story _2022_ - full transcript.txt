I mean, like, that's what guys do, but you're just like, "oh, everyone's so nice." all those guys in here, they're just being goofy. You know, what is wrong with you? You always have to find something to fight about! Yeah, because I'm sick of this! I'm not dealing with this right now. No! No, no, no. You don't get to shut me out. I have every right to be pissed at you. Let go of me. I wanna get my laptop. Why? So you can read more comments about how hot you are? - Brian. - What? Let go of me! All right, we're gonna walk away from each other right now 'cause you need to calm down. [alarm chirps] [scoffs] I wanna get in the van! Well, you're not gonna, all right? Hey. Hey! Hey! Would you stop? Would you stop it? Stop... - No! - Ow! [grunts] [screams] - [ringing] - how do you like that, huh?! [gasps] [gabby crying] gabby, gabby, up, up. Hey, you're causing a scene right now. Causing a scene, so we need to get out of here right now. Get in the van. Gotta get in the van. Get in the van. Back up. [moaning] [grunts] [alarm chirps] [breathing heavily] come on. You're all right. You're all right. - You're all right. - Come on. [line rings] female dispatcher: 9-1-1. What's your emergency? Yeah, I'm on the corner of main street by moonflower. Uh, and I'd like to report a domestic dispute. [breathing heavily] okay. All right. Look, I think the problem here is that you're just... you're not understanding... You're not understanding how these guys are looking at you, right? Because, like, I know you think you're being nice. I know you think they're being nice, but they're not. - They're being... - [siren wailing in distance] - they're being... - Hey, you need to pull over. - Why? It's not for us. - Brian, you need to pull over. - There's no way it's for us. - The police are... that is for us. - He's right behind us. - I'm... I'm... I'm going... - Brian, you need to pull over. - Don't grab the wheel. - Don't grab the wheel. - Brian, you need to pull over. Please stop right there! I am gonna pull over, all right? - Pull over then. - I'm pulling over. - It's the law! - [siren wailing] [engine turns off] - now, like, I... - Well, I just... I told you that he was coming, and you needed to pull over. Yeah, I-I was pulling over, and you grabbed the wheel. No, you weren't. You pulled over when you heard the thing... Shh. Gab... Okay, turn your engine off for me. [engine turns off] go ahead and set the keys on your dash for me, all right? What's your guys' names? - Gabby. - Brian laundrie. Gabby? Brian? Okay. What's going on? How come you're crying? I'm just crying. We've just been fighting this morning. Some personal issues. Can I get you to step out of the vehicle for me, ma'am? Yeah. Go ahead and hang tight for me, all right? Why don't you walk over here with me? I have the female passenger separated from the male. - Excuse me, sir. - Yeah. - Hey, good day. - Hey. - Any weapons in the car? - No. Uh... So what's going on? I don't know. Sometimes it's just, like, like, I get really bad ocd, and I... I was cleaning and straightening up the back of the van before, and I was apologizing to him, saying, "I'm sorry for being so mean," because sometimes... Sometimes I have bad ocd, and I get really frustrated, and not, like, mean towards him, just, like, I don't know. So I was saying, "I'm sorry if I'm in a bad mood." it's just, I'm really stressed, and I had so much work to do on my computer this morning. What do you do for a living? Well... I just quit my job to travel across the country and I'm trying to start a blog. - Hmm. - But I have a blog. So... I'm building my website, and it's been really stressful, and... He doesn't even believe I can do any of it, so... That's kind of in my head, and I don't... I don't know. He's kind of a downer, and I don't know, this morning, we were just fighting, and he wouldn't let me in the car before. Why would he let you in the car? Because of the ocd? He said I need to calm down, yeah. But... I'm, like, perfectly calm. I'm calm all the time. This just really stresses me out, and this is a rough morning. [police radio chatter] oh. You, uh, you spoke to gabrielle, my, uh, fiancée? Yeah, I spoke to her. Why don't you tell me what happened? Um... Well, she just... you know, she gets worked up sometimes, and so, like, I try to... I try to keep my distance. Um... That's why I locked the car and was walking away. Um, but... So what... What happened this morning was that she was working on a little, like, website blog and everything. - [siren wailing] - so, um... I was, uh... Uh, I, you know, I was giving her time and everything, and... and, um... We really had a... like, a really nice morning, if anything. But she just got worked up because we were trying to get going 'cause we had to get our day started 'cause we were supposed to hike, uh, arches. - [gabby crying] - [police radio chatter] gabby, you have some marks on your face. Did he hit you? We have witnesses who say they saw him hit you. Well, I... Yeah, but... I mean, to be honest, I-I hit him first. [police radio chatter] so... What do you wanna do? [sighs] she says she hit him first, but... I mean, technically, she's the primary aggressor, but... How big a feather you need to knock this kid over? I really don't wanna take her to jail over this. If she said she had no intention of giving him any injury, we don't have to call a domestic assault. We could just do a 24-hour no-contact order. Yeah, I'm good with that. [sighs] yeah, so they took him to a hotel and said I could get him in 24 hours. - Are you sure you want to? - Rose. Gabby, I'm telling you, these episodes of brian's are not gonna stop happening. Well, you don't know that, and... and this... This was just a bad fight. I'm saying you should get in your car. Drive away. Come home to me. - Yeah, come on, rose. - I mean it. So what, what, you're saying I should just abandon him in utah? That's what I'm saying. [sighs] [sighs] [animal calls in distance] [sighs] [switch clicks] okay. [sighs] [touchpad clicking] [exhales deeply] [keys jangle] [engine starts] [brakes squeal] [sighs] [shifts gears] [van approaches] [sighs] [gears shift, engine turns off, keys jangle] hey. Hey. I'm sorry about yesterday. It's okay. Let's just forget about it, okay? Ahh. [camera shutter clicking] got it. [sighs] here. Set. Is that perfect enough for you? Yeah. It'll work. [train whistle blowing in distance] okay. You know, if you're so miserable, like, why are you trying to project to everybody, like, what a wonderful life you're having? I mean, I'm not miserable. I'm just a little... Confused by everything. Okay. So, like... What are you confused by? Um... I don't know. Just... Eh. It's just not as easy as I thought it was gonna be, you know? Oh. Are you... Are you talking about, um, the trip, or are you talking about us? I mean... Both, I guess. Okay, so what you're saying is basically you thought that everything would be easier with me? Easier with us. Don't you think? You can't expect everything to be sunshine all the time. I don't. Everybody has rough patches, gabby. Well, you don't deal with them very well, brian. Yeah, it's all me. [sighs] yeah, so you guys are getting on each other's nerves or... Kinda. You don't look happy. It's just been tough. I mean, I-I don't know what I expected, but it... Well, sweetie, brian's right about one thing. No one has a relationship where it's all fun and games. Then why even be in a relationship? Gabby, you gotta be kidding me. Of course I'm kidding, mom. It's just... It's... it's, like, so messed up. It's like one second, I'm... I'm so happy and in love and the next, he's like a total stranger. And it's so frustrating because, like, all we do is fight. And I... I've been thinking it over and over and over, and I-I just... I... I don't know. I just... I feel like... I don't know where this is going anymore. Well... Look, you are still young. You've got plenty of time to figure things out, and... It's not like you guys are married yet. Um, I know. You know, I look back on your dad and I, and well... As it turns out, we were better off as just friends. No, I get it. And I don't think we're that bad. And I don't wanna put all the blame on him either. You know? Like, I've... I've got my issues, too, but... Something's definitely not there that should be. [indistinct conversations] hey, bro. I ordered water, like, 10 minutes ago. Okay. [sighs] [crunching] - here you go. - Awesome. Yeah. See how easy that was? Chimp could do that. [laughs] brian. What the hell is the matter with you? Do you know how rude that was? How long am I supposed to wait? Like... You've been in a crappy mood all day. [indistinct conversations] [sighs] you know, I overheard you talking to your mom yesterday. What about it? Do you... Do you really not love me anymore? [sighs] I-I-I didn't say that. Of course I love you. It's just... I told her things are complicated. Okay. Well, you know that I love you, right? Yeah. Great. That's great, 'cause then we can work on everything else. - Right? - Yeah. Maybe. Probably, but... Um... Look, uh... [sighs] what... what happened in utah, I can't... No, no, no, no, no. We don't have to talk about that. That's over and done with. It's over. Yeah, but the thing is, though, brian, is it's not. Brian, you... you hit me. And I apologize for that. No, you didn't. I apologized. Okay. All right, all right. All right. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Okay? Can we try to remember, though, that you did a little hitting on your own? - Okay. - Yeah? Okay. Fine, and I-I admit that. But... Don't you think that suggests we're in, like, a toxic relationship? What is with these, like, what is with these buzzwords, huh? Like "toxic relationship." I don't know what that means. Well, what would you call it? Why do we have to call it anything? It is what it is. So why... why put a label on it? You need to stop yelling. I don't care what these people think. That... that's your problem with your blogs and your tiktoks. You're like all these other girls trying to be like a walking advertisement for how great your life is, but that... That is not how the real world works, all right? It's not my fault that I can't live up to this frickin' fantasy that you're building online, right? Real life... It gets messy sometimes. Dirt is going to get tracked into the van sometimes. I'm the real brian! I can't expect me to be the... the brian that you're just, like, showing off to the world! Can we get another basket of chips, please?! - [door opens, bells jangle] - I'm so sorry. - [door closes] - [exhales deeply] [exhales deeply] hey, you don't have to look at me like this. I... - I got it out of my system. - It isn't about today. Okay. So... What... what is it? You scare me sometimes. Gabby, I'm... Gabby, I'm not trying to scare you. It doesn't matter what you're trying to do, brian. You get these flashes of anger, and you scare me. Look, I'm... I just... [chuckles] I wanna give you a hug. We had an argument. Now it's over, right? Hey. Okay, all right. Okay, you're all right. You all right? Yeah? Okay, let's go. I'm really sorry. Okay? Okay. All right. Where to next? - [starts engine] - grand te-tons? "tee-tons"? You say it. Yeah? Let's go! [package rustling] hey, gabs. Gabs, could you open this for me? - Thanks. - [sighs] [rustling continues] awesome. [crunches] [mouth full] oh, you know what? We're making really good time. I think we're gonna get to the campsite before, like, sunset. You know, I was... Thinking about what I said back there? And, like, I think I've been looking at this whole blog thing wrong. 'cause some of these influencers... They make, like, bank, you know? How many followers are you up to? I don't know. I get more every day. That's great! So, like, how many more till you can, like, monetize? I don't know. Well, I think that the stuff that you're putting out there is, like, it's way better than most of the other crap, you know? Like, the dancing and the makeovers and stuff like that. I think I get it, you know? I think I'm finally getting it. We're... we're showing people america. Like, most people don't get to see this. Yeah. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm, um, just... I'm good. Okay. Oh! My god. Oh, my god! We gotta take a photograph of that, right? Come on. You in front of that? We gotta stop. We gotta stop. Come on. Okay, do you wanna, like, you wanna jump? - No. - Jump into it or something? No, just... brian, just take the picture. Oh, I'm so sorry. Excuse me. Do you mind taking a photograph of me and my fiancée? - Okay. Yeah. - Thank you. [camera shutter clicks] looks good. - Awesome. Thanks so much. - You're welcome. Appreciate it. Aw, look at that. [laughs] that's great. All right, what do you think? Is that for the blog? Or is that for us? I don't know. It's kinda creepy. Yeah, it's, like, the whole point. I mean, like, 'cause of the... Sign and everything, so... Yeah. You know, there's a really beautiful view of the mountains coming up, so you're probably gonna wanna get that for the blog, right? Probably. [chuckles] okay. Are you just not gonna talk to me at all? Or is it, like... I am talking to you. I just don't feel like talking right now. Well, if we don't communicate, we're not gonna get anywhere, so... Well, we're not getting anywhere, and you suddenly pretending you're interested in the blog isn't changing that. So, what, that's it? We're just gonna leave it... Brian! Give me a minute. [sighs] [inhales and exhales deeply] [birds calling] [fire crackling] [animals calling] gabby. I'm really sorry. And not just for the scene in the restaurant or for utah, but for... Everything. Look... I'm full of insecurity. I know that. I just... I think I hope that you'd never figure that out. You know, you... you have always been out of my league. Like, even back in high school. And when a girl like you tells a guy like me that he's worthy? Guys like me, we just start to worry that one day... You're gonna figure out the truth. So I tried. I tried really hard to be worthy of you. But I blew it. But... I want you to know that I have made the decision that from now on, I will be the man that you deserve. I'm gonna get back on my meds. I'm gonna make something of myself for you, because I wanna build a future together. So this... this is gonna change, and I just need you to give me a chance to prove that to you. Brian... I love you. I do. I always will. ♪♪ [sighs] [sadly] hey, mom. [upbeat voice] hey, mom. Um... We've just been... [clears throat] traveling for a few days, so, um... No, d... no, detective. We don't live in florida. Our daughter does. We're calling you from new york. Man: Oh, I see. Okay. How long has she been missing? I mean, we... we don't know, exactly. We just know we haven't heard from her since the 27th, and that's unusual. She's not responding to anything, not from me, not from my ex-wife. Well, uh, okay. Let me have her name and address. [clears throat] well, see, that's the thing. She's not in florida either. They've been traveling the country for the last several months. That's a problem. If she's not even in the state, there's really not much I can do. Yeah, but that's... [sighs] look, the last we knew, she was in wyoming. All right, that helps, right? It doesn't help me, but what you could do is get on the phone with wyoming. Who in wyoming? So... She's been missing a week and a half, and... We can't get anybody to help us. Like, the local police keep saying... I mean, she's been traveling the country with... with her boyfriend, and... Usually, she posts something pretty much almost every day, and all of that has stopped. This is from around the 20th. And how old is she? - 20... - She's... - She's 22. - 22. Yeah. [sighs] yes. I know. She's an adult. She can come and go as she pleases, and she doesn't have to check in with her mom, but she does, is my point. And she always does, with the both of us. [telephone ringing in distance] something about this is not right. I have one. Same age. I get it. - Hmm. - Okay. Tell me everything I need to know. Let's see if we can't find your daughter. [typing] [taps key] [sighs] joe: He's already back in florida? Since when? Almost two weeks. And gabby was not with him. Well, what did he have to say about that? Brian hasn't said anything at all, and they're only speaking through their lawyer. Their lawyer? They've already hired a lawyer? That doesn't mean anything definitively in and of itself. [sighs] but you need to know what's going on. Gabby is now officially a missing person, and he is a person of interest. Reporter: Been able to come up with a cure in two years. The government has beefed up the research fund by $2 million in hopes of speeding up work on a cure. Reporter #2: A north port resident has gone missing while on a cross-country trip with her fiancé. 22-year-old gabby petito left florida in early July, but according to her family, she hasn't been heard from in two weeks. Reporter #3: The disappearance of a florida woman is raising concerns. 22-year-old gabby petito and her fiancée, brian laundrie, left on a camping adventure cross country, but only he returned. [amplified voice] that is what we have so far from the various local law enforcement agencies. So at this time, I'm going to allow joe, gabby's dad, to come up and say a few words. [indistinct conversations, camera shutters clicking] - thank you. - Okay. [camera shutters continue clicking] [amplified voice] hi. What I need from everyone here is help. 'cause the goal is still not met, and the goal is to bring gabby home safe. I'm asking help from everyone here. I'm asking help from everyone at home. I'm asking help from the parents of brian. You know, there's a... There's a tip line that you can call in anonymously, whatever you can do to make sure my daughter comes home. I'm asking for that help. There is nothing else that matters to me. This girl... this is what matters. Thank you. [indistinct conversations] uh, what is brian's side of the story? Brian laundrie continues to exercise his fifth amendment rights to remain silent. All I can tell you is that two people went on a trip, and one of them returned. And that person who returned isn't providing us any information. At this time, I want to read a statement on behalf of the petito family to brian laundrie. If you or your family have any decency left, please tell us where gabby is located. Tell us if we are even looking in the right place. All we want is for gabby to come home. Please help us make that happen. We haven't been able to sleep or eat, and our lives are falling apart. Reporter: Dramatic video of missing person gabby petito and her fiancé brian laundrie has just been made available in this exclusive first look. Gabby: And it's been really stressful, and he doesn't really believe I can do any of it, so that's kinda in my head, and I don't know. He's just... He's kind of a downer. And I don't know. This morning, we were just fighting, and he wouldn't let me in the car before. Yeah. Officer: Why wouldn't he let you into the car? She's crying. He's laughing. Reporter: The couple were apparently pulled over after a 9-1-1 call... Don't you guys see what's going on?! The incident of domestic abuse. Reporter #2: In a story that has captured national attention, everyone seems to be asking the same question. Where is gabby? [crowd clamoring] man: Bring gabby home! [siren wails] - [helicopter blades whirring] - woman: Arrest brian! [siren wails] [clamoring continues] man: Where's gabby?! Ooh. We got officers on the scene. Okay. [clamoring continues] man: Come on! Speak up! [clamoring continues] where's gabby?! Where is she?! Woman: Get him! [crowd shouting indistinctly] give up your son! [indistinct shouting continues] woman: Bring her home! [indistinct shouting continues] justice for gabby! [clamoring continues] come on! [clamoring continues] get his face when they bring him out. Ooh, and go tight on the cuffs. [indistinct shouting] [clears throat] [helicopter whirring] is brian under arrest? Man: Did he tell you where gabby is? What are you charging him with? All right, listen, an arrest warrant was issued for brian laundrie because it is believed that he used gabby petito's debit card without authorization. So you are arresting him? Folks, brian isn't here. Man: Well, where is he?! - Everybody! - [clamoring continues] now... According to his parents, brian left a few days ago. - [gasps] - what? And... No one has any idea where he is. [helicopter whirring, clamoring continues] tell us about your friendship with gabby. What kind of things did you do? Uh, we pretty much just hang out and chill, and she would follow me everywhere. Uh, we have this joke that, um, she was my... Um... Uh... What do we call her? Uh... My emotional service human. [laughs] and just, she would just always be cheering me up, you know? Reporter: And what was her relationship with brian like? Uh, I'm sorry. What is it like? Thank you. Uh... On the outside, he could be very charismatic. I mean, there's no doubt in my mind that gabby loves him. But you know, just, like, any couple, like, they had their arguments. Reporter: Brian is not talking to the police. What is your message to him? If he just gave us any bit of information, anything that would... It would give us a place to start. I just wanna find my friend. Man: So now right there, you'll see brian's mother is heading to the shed in their backyard. Right here, you can see that she wants to make sure no one's watching. And there you can see him. Brian's in the shed. It's clear they're keeping him back there. I don't know why the hell the cops aren't taking this seriously. [sighs] man #2: I think all of them are wrong. I think she's still alive and out there someplace. I think they just got into another big-ass fight. I mean, this guy's a hothead, but he doesn't look like he could kill her to me. Now you can always tell a killer by his eyes. Always. Brian's got eyes more like you'd see in a wall street bad guy. I can see him driving away, leaving her stuck by herself. But nah, he'd never actually kill her. [sighs] woman: On August 29th, my boyfriend and I actually picked up brian at grand teton national park sometime that night. Uh... When I saw him on tiktok, I recognized him as the same guy. Anyway, he said that he needed to go to jackson, and we said, "hop in" because we were going there. We made small talk, and he said that he had been camping for multiple days without his fiancée. He did mention his fiancée and said that she was back at their van working on their social media page. Um, and then all of a sudden, he just freaks out. He's like, "I've gotta get out right now!" [scoffs] so we pulled over at the jackson dam, and he kinda, like, hurried out of the car. Um... He had some scruff, but for someone who had been camping for several days, he didn't look dirty. He didn't smell dirty. And that part was kinda weird. Weeding out all the nutjobs, we've got several eyewitness accounts that are clicking together to give us maybe a useful narrative. Let's talk about the couple that said they picked up brian laundrie hitchhiking. And let's assume for the moment he did kill this poor girl. He has just killed his fiancée. He's panicking. He decides to just leave everything behind, get the hell out of there. [panting] [whispers] okay. [exhales deeply] he's picked up by miranda baker and her boyfriend. He makes up an alibi about camping by himself while gabby is back at the van alone. Maybe his story's gonna be some stranger found her out there, killed her while he was away. Who knows? But at some point on his way out of dodge, he realizes this is a bad plan because he has left all the evidence behind. As she tells it, he freaks and decides to bail. Six minutes later, he gets another ride, this time taking him back to the campground he came from. But here's the thing. Not all the way. The driver said he was willing to take him further into the camp, which is a huge, spread-out site. But he says he'd rather walk. I mean, wouldn't want them to drive him right to the murder scene, would he? He buries her. He cleans the site best he can. He packs up everything that will show he was ever there, and he drives off. - [engine starts] two days later, he arrives back in florida all by his lonesome. So if these witnesses are credible, and I believe they are, if laundrie did, in fact, kill gabby, she'd be somewhere out here in these 5 or 6 square miles. See anything? Nope. - [dogs panting] - come on, boy. [dog whimpers and barks] and we are live in 4, 3... Searchers are trying to keep up hope, but so far, the search for gabby petito remains a frustrating dead end. Reporter: Officials from the national park service as well as local law enforcement agencies say they will continue ground surveys as long as daylight allows. Man: We spotted something about a half mile east of your location... Patch of earth that you might wanna take a look at. - [radio beeps] - roger that. [siren wails] [helicopter whirring] what do we got? Look. Hey, hey, hold on. [whispers indistinctly] [whispering] okay. [sighs] one moment. Come on. [cellphone rings] [continues ringing] [breathes shakily] hello? And we're out here at the wyoming command center in search for missing woman gabby petito, and I've just received some very sad news. - [sobbing] - I've just been informed that a search party has come across the remains of a young woman, and by all indications... [voice echoing] it appears to be the body of gabby petito. [continues sobbing] [birds chirping] [engine turns off] [breathing heavily] reporter: Since brian laundrie's whereabouts are still unknown, there's been speculation he may have received help from his parents to avoid questioning, and his parents are still not cooperating with the authorities. Man: Hand me those. It's just his damn mother. You need to tell your clients that they're coming dangerously close to an obstruction charge. Brian's parents, as I've said before, have no knowledge of their son's whereabouts. Right. His mother just happened to know where her son parked his mustang in 25,000 acres of wilderness. It would appear so. Did you read the coroner's report? Of course I read it. Official cause of death... Manual strangulation and throttling. I'm waiting for a point. The point is this is who you are protecting. [sighs] oh. Hi. - Um... - [chuckles] I'm... I know who you are, rose. Come here. [sighs] - I just... Uh... - [water pouring] [voice breaking] I just can't shake this feeling that I have in my gut that there was something else I could have done. There wasn't. - [whispers] thank you. - Um... [chuckles] I mean... I knew her relationship was rocky, and I just let her go. [clears throat] do you... do you think she would've let you stop her? [laughs] no. [crying] yeah, so... What could you have done? Look... Gabby... she, uh... [chuckles] she lived her life exactly how she wanted to. You know, that's part of what we all loved about her. Some of these, uh... Thoughts that you've been having, they've, uh... They've been torturing me, too. But we can't let them. You know, we're... We're gonna be... [crying] we're gonna be missing her for the rest of our lives, so... We have to figure out, uh, a way to live with that. How? [sniffles] um... Just... By remembering the good. [voice breaking] I mean, it's... it's, uh... It's... it's r... it's... it's rough. It's going to be rough. [sobbing] but... There are... there are a lot of us, rose. And we're gonna get through it together. I just have a lot of this anger that I don't know what to do with, and that son of a bitch is still out there. Mm. Yeah, well, for now. - [bell tolling] - woman: Such a tragedy. I wanna thank you guys for coming out and... And showing your respects for gabby. But I don't want you to be sad. Gabby didn't live her life that way. She always made people feel welcomed. She... She treated people with respect. She cared. She genuinely cared. [crying in background] my daughter lived a short life, but she lived an inspiring one. I want you to look at the pictures around this room and... I want you to be inspired by them. We've gotten emails from around the country from people that gabby touched... People who wanna live their lives bigger, people who wanna... [chuckles] they wanna get rid of the things that are holding 'em back. And that's the most important thing. If you're in a... Relationship... That might not be the best thing for you, leave it. Leave it now. [birds chirping] gabby's the most amazing person I've ever met. I could not be more proud of her as a... [sobbing in background] As a father. I really am sorry. Gabby, I need you to forgive me if I'm going to... [breathes heavily] [exhales deeply] you'd probably let me do it, wouldn't you? You'd let me do it if you were here. Okay. [exhales deeply] [gunshot] I mean... That's the question, isn't it? [chuckles] what finally made brian snap? I'm gonna get back on my meds. I'm gonna make something of myself for you because I wanna build a future together. So things are gonna change, okay? And I just need you to give me the chance to prove that. Brian... I love you. I do. I always will. But... We're not good together. - No, gabby, no, no, no. - Listen to me. - That's... - Listen. You're not a bad person. I'm not a bad person. It's just this trip has shown me what it would be like if we stayed together, and all we do is fight. That's not true. We don't... That's not all we do. We... Brian, we fight every day. And I don't want my life to be like that. And I don't... I don't know what I want it to be, exactly, but not... not that. And I... Ooh. I... [sighs] I need to be with someone whose life is more than just about me. You suggested this whole trip. I... I thought you wanted to travel and see the world together, but... It feels like you just want me all to yourself. You know, most girls... they... They would... They would love that kind of attention. Well, not this one. [scoffs] [sighs] brian... It's not your fault, okay? It's not. You don't have to want the same things that I do. You know? I think a lot of the time I was projecting what... what I wanted on to you, and that was selfish. And I'm... I'm sorry. That was my fault. I'm... I'm really sorry. Gabby, gabby, look, I need you to think about this, please. Brian, brian. This is all I have been thinking about for weeks. It isn't fair for either of us to hold on to something that we know isn't working. Brian. You have to know it isn't working. I think we should take the van back to florida, and I can get on a bus back home to new york. Brian? C'mon brian, talk to me. Hey. Hey, brian, it's not... It's not your fault, okay? It's not. It's not your fault. It's not your fault, okay? It's okay. It's okay. No. Brian. Brian. Brian. Brian. - No. - Brian. Brian! Brian! Brian! - [thunderclap] - [panting] [continues panting] [thunderclap] reporter: Flood waters that made the search for brian laundrie in the carlton nature reserve so difficult have receded, and brian's parents are now finally seeming to cooperate with the authorities. - [dogs barking] they've mentioned several places in the reserve where they think brian may have taken refuge. Searchers are now examining those areas. Over here. Joe: You wanna know what I got to say about him? What's there to say? [dog barking in distance] the bastard admitted what he did in that notebook they found. Like there was any doubt. Brian laundrie was a coward. I mean, how else do you define a guy like that? He destroyed a thing of beauty that brought nothing but joy to people. Then he ran away and took the easy way out. [flies buzzing] he won't be missed. Gabby, on the other hand, she... She'll be missed. I have learned so many things on this trip so far. I have learned that my country is beautiful. I mean, look at this. I learned that the people are beautiful. But the most positive thing I've learned is that we live in a really good world. I mean, yeah, bad stuff happens, but a lot of really good stuff happens, too, and it's up to us which to focus on, so... I choose the good stuff.
