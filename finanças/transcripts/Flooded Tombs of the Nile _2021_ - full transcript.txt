I start off by saying, "Hey, who wants to go scuba dive a pyramid in the Sahara?" And see what the reaction is. As an archeologist, am I curious to open up a tomb, and look and see what's inside? Absolutely, I am. But no one's done anything quite like this. How do you excavate tombs in the desert underwater? Sudan has an incredible and long history. For hundreds of years, people have been focusing on the really big, well-preserved monuments of Egypt, and overlooked what is today Sudan. You have pyramids. You have burial chambers that are probably unexcavated. You have dozens of kings, dozens and dozens of queens and princesses and princes. To have the opportunity to go in and excavate these things is really incredible. Aah! Oh, look at that! Look at that, look at that! That's gold! Every time you go diving, you're putting yourself at risk. We are using surface-supplied air. It's one less thing to deal with: having a big tank on your back in a confined environment where you're not entirely sure how sturdy the walls are. Just so we're all clear on the plan. We go down to the chute. Hold onto the chute, take a couple of deep breaths and just hang out there. Good to go? Let's do it! And right as I hit the water, as the cold water starts to infiltrate into my wetsuit, I look up and start to have this thought about, "Okay, this is somebody's burial place. "This is a place to be respected. A place to be learned from. A place to understand." And it just registers. This watery grave is the 2,000 year old burial place of a Nubian king named Nastasen. Tombs give us time capsules. Glimpses into the history of a people and place. Archeologist Pearce Paul Creasman is hoping to learn more about who Nastasen was, and the ancient world around him, from the secrets his pyramid still holds. More than nine meters above the dive, site inspector Fakhri Hassan and underwater archeologist Kristin Romey are positioned to receive buckets of mud sent up from the tomb floor. The goal of this season is to really begin to excavate the burial chamber of Nastasen. That requires moving a lot of material out of the burial chamber to be examined. Each bucket holds a promise to reveal new clues about the king, and how he was laid to rest. So while we have divers down in the tomb and pulling up the buckets, the sieving needs to be done topside, because we can't allow this material to dry out. Just in case there's something particularly fragile, because it'll... it could literally just turn to dust. Looking for gold, and bones, and anything that should not be in normal sediment. I have water if you want. Okay, I think this is good. - Enough? - But, um... Yeah, I think this is enough. Aah! Bingo! Five minutes in, and we already hit gold. It's gold foil, so imagine like aluminum foil that's been crinkled over time. It's paper thin. It's almost like tissue paper. Tissue paper made of gold. This is good. Good luck. Yep, good luck. Thank you, Nastasen! To the archeologists, the early find of gold is a good sign they're on the right track. Even more exciting is what they discover next. Oh! Hey, Fakhri! - What? - Who is this? A figurine, called a shabti, is traditionally carved in the buried king's likeness. This may be, maybe... Nastasen. Because it's the same face... but we will see. We will study to make a comparison. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. - We will see. That's wonderful. Yeah, that's wonderful. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah, that's a good one. Yeah. This is new information that lets us understand our history more. This site is important because it's one of the royal cemeteries of Kush. This is one of the most ancient kingdoms of Sudan. Beginning more than 4,000 years ago, the kingdom of Kush ruled much of the Nubian desert, including what's now Northern Sudan. From 650 to 300 BC, the Kushites buried their royalty near Napata, the heart of their dynasty at its most powerful point in history. Nuri is one of the most important burial grounds in this region, situated at the 4th cataract of the Nile. There were more than 80 burials of kings, queens, princes, and princesses here at Nuri alone. There are only about 300 or 400 pyramids total in all of Egypt and Sudan. And for so many of them to be concentrated at this one place, that is incredible. This must have been the creme de la creme of the culture and society at the time. Starting in 1913, American archeologist George Reisner excavated many Kush burial sites, discovering the tombs of its most prominent kings. Reisner was the first archeologist to excavate at Nuri. He really put Nuri on a map. He and his team moved from pyramid to pyramid, but they began to run into a problem... water. When the men arrived at what's now known to be Nastasen's tomb, they found it partially flooded, and with one of the chambers collapsed. Reisner, from what I understand, sent a very reluctant worker into this dark tomb. And from what it seems like, this worker kind of ran into the burial chamber, hastily dug a hole, pulled out a couple shabtis to confirm it was indeed Nastasen, and then they got out of there. They wanted to learn whose tomb it was. They ultimately got a couple shabtis that had the king's name on it, Nastasen, but other than that, no one has been, as near as we can tell, no one's even been in this tomb since Nastasen was buried there. In the centuries since Nastasen was laid to rest, the Nile river basin has risen at Nuri. Climate change, industrial agriculture, and construction of dams have changed the levels of the water, flooding many of the tombs. It's these waters that may have saved the rich burials from a common fate. Of course, the problem with pyramids is that they're big targets. They say, "Hey, there's a big pile of loot buried underneath me. Come get it." Even in ancient times, these tombs were being plundered left and right. However, at Nuri it seems that these chambers were untouched, because the water rose. It becomes exceedingly more difficult to get to. Being underwater makes it off limits to most of humanity. In 2018, Pearce Paul Creasman launched his first expedition to open Nastasen's tomb. He invited underwater archeologist Kristin Romey to join him. I've done shipwrecks, I've been in caves, but I think there is nothing, nothing in the world that compares to diving in a tomb under a pyramid in a desert in Sudan. Nothing. For the first time going into a tomb and not knowing, I really could not have expected better conditions, because the water level was not extremely high. The water levels change from year to year, but it was immediately apparent why the pyramid had spooked Reisner's team. The groundwater from the Nile had risen into all three chambers of Nastasen's tomb. The smallest first chamber was completely submerged. The roof of the second chamber collapsed at some point in antiquity, creating an extra air pocket. The third and final chamber is where the king would have been buried, surrounded by treasures for the afterlife. But for Pearce Paul and Kristin, braving the flooded chambers paid off. I think the big moment of realization of what we actually had in Nastasen's pyramid was when Pearce Paul led me to the third chamber in the back, and we were just waving our flashlights around, and he pointed to this little niche in the back wall, and the flashlight caught on little bits of gold in the niche, left there for centuries and centuries and centuries. It was incredible. And when I realized that there was just like gold lying around, that this is an untouched burial. If anybody had been in that tomb to rob it, stands to reason they'd have taken the gold shiny stuff off of the shelf at eye level. The untouched treasure is a hint that something else could be in the burial chamber. Something even rarer than gold. In the middle of the third chamber, there's a large mound. It's got stones all around it, and it is very conveniently about the size of a person. It's about six feet long and about three feet wide, and then a pile around it. This season, a year later, Pearce Paul is hoping to uncover the burial, and learn whether Nastasen is still inside. Pyramids in general, don't often retain their intended occupants. It's actually exceedingly rare to find a pyramid with the person in it. If you're looking at, really kind of untouched royal burials in this part of the world, the last really big one was about a century ago. It was Tut. And he was really a relatively minor pharaoh in the bigger scheme of things. Tut's famous because he's got an untouched tomb. Nastasen, on the other hand, there's all sorts of major political upheaval in the ancient world that he's part of. Being able to excavate the untouched royal tomb of Nastasen, I think is going to be an immense wealth of information. Nuri is one of the most intensive concentrations of pyramids anywhere in the world, across any culture and civilization. In Sudan, in fact, there are more pyramids than in Egypt, and this is a thing that people don't think of very often. Kush and Egypt have a long, interwoven history, one that is just beginning to be more fully understood. Most of what we know in the history books about the Kingdom of Kush, comes from the perspective of the Egyptians, because the Egyptians had writing. And the Egyptians wrote everything down. Everything. They pushed a phenomenal amount of paper, we would say in today's world. And we are fortunate to have a lot of those records. But those records frame everyone outside of Egypt as somehow not equal to, or lesser than. History is written by the victors, the one percent. And archeology tells the story of the underdogs. The other 99 percent. The best way to really verify or disqualify a historical account is to look for the facts on the ground. Sometimes it jives with the history books, and sometimes it doesn't. Archeologist Geoff Emberling has excavated many important Kush monuments, uncovering its past brick by brick. We know that from the very first moment that Kush appears in history, around 2000 BC, it was powerful. It was so powerful that the Egyptians at that time built a series of fortresses along the Nile to protect themselves against the military power of Kush. From its prime position on the Nile, the Kush empire controlled trade routes from the south up to Egypt, transporting ivory, leopard skins, precious stones, and gold. They had the connections with inner Africa that could bring these exotic products all the way to Egypt, and to the wider Mediterranean world. They were the go-betweens, and they became very, very rich and powerful off being in that position. Egypt relied on Kushite gold for their elaborate burials... and fierce Kushite warriors to supplement Egyptian armies. Eventually the Kushites gained so much power the Egyptians saw them as a threat, and invaded their neighbors to the south. For the next 400 years, Kush was controlled by Egypt. In the beginning, the Egyptians imposed their gods and temples on Kush. They were taking the elites of Kushite society and giving them Egyptian educations. But the Kushites eventually became even more devout spiritual followers than their conquerors. Even as the Egyptian empire began to lose strength and withdraw in 1100 BC, the Kushites continued building their tombs in the shapes of pyramids. The jewelry found inside the burials makes clear their devotion to Egyptian gods. We know that by at least, at the bare minimum, by the 8th century BC, Kush is on the rise. They have thrown off the shackles of their Egyptian colonizers, but they do retain some Egyptian elements. For the center of their kingdom, the Kushites took over a place full of spiritual significance to the Egyptians. A stunning sandstone butte rising high above the desert landscape. Jebel Barkal, or "sacred mountain." From here, the Kush kings were able to control an increasingly extensive territory. Ultimately, that rise of power led to the Kushites being able to conquer all of Egypt. And that's historically just remarkable. For nearly a hundred years, a succession of five Kushite kings ruled all of Egypt. From Napata, their capital, they controlled more area than any other Egyptian pharaohs, stretching from modern-day Khartoum to the Mediterranean. One of these Kushite Kings, a renowned warrior named Taharqa, established Nuri as a royal cemetery. In many ways, Taharqa was the most notable 25th dynasty king. The cemetery that he established at Nuri became the royal burial ground for Kush for over 300 years. So, he became the ancestor that the succeeding kings of Kush wanted to connect themselves to. Kings like Nastasen, who Pearce Paul is hoping may still lie inside his tomb. I would like to find evidence of Nastasen himself. I'm not saying I want to come up face to face with him in the middle of the third chamber, um, in the dark, but it'd be an experience. When Pearce Paul's team begins their second season of excavation, they find Nastasen's tomb in an unexpected, and unnerving condition. The morning of the first dive, I'll admit I was apprehensive. This was a completely different situation than it was last season. We were all really surprised about how much water was in there. The water table was considerably lower last year. This year we are now working with at least 15 feet more vertical of water. Last season, the team attempted to pump the water out of the burial chambers, but the water pressure coming from the outside of the walls puts the tomb at great risk of collapsing. When we tried to pump, it was just like a faucet running, and there's a hundred different faucets coming through the walls. I don't think it's worth the risk. It's more like putting a paper bag in the ocean, and then trying to take the water out of the paper bag. What do you think's gonna happen? The rest of the water is gonna rush in and try and... And it will crumple the bag. Regardless of whether or not we were able to safely and comfortably pump it dry and dig it, it's still a tomb. We don't want it to be a tomb for more than one person. Nastasen's plenty. So you're coming in as well? I'm coming in as well. Okay. So, today we're actually gonna do excavation work. Dave is gonna be on the outside. - Okay. - Manning hoses, air, emergency whatever. And I will go in first. If we touch hands, I might squeeze once. If you squeeze once, it means okay. If you do multiple squeezes, I'm gonna pull you out through that chute. Even though I kind of laid awake the night before, kind of running through my head, okay, you go down to this staircase. This is the way you enter the tomb. Then you hit chamber one, chamber two. And I'm walking myself through it. I knew that regardless of how many times I was looping that through my head, it was not gonna be what I was going to encounter. - You'll be standing. - Okay. So I bring in an empty bucket in, and I write down the number of... The empty bucket on the next line. ...The empty bucket on the next line. And then you figure out if it's A, B, C. By carefully keeping track of where each of the buckets comes from, Pearce Paul will be able to match up any objects they find inside to specific areas of the tomb. My bucket came from, you know, the northwest corner of that... Piecing together the burial, and laying clues to where Nastasen's remains might be. - Okay. - Does that make sense? Understood, okay. The biggest problem is gonna be panic. Of course, that's always what it is. You know, if something happens. Claustrophobia and panic are your biggest concerns. Yeah. If you're inside and you are panicking, - get to the air pocket. - Mm-hmm. - If you're by the front door, get out. - Yeah. Um, but get to the air pocket, sit and wait. Someone will come to you if you don't feel like you can get out on your own. It's not easy. You know, when you're topside, you're in this brilliant, you know, Sudanese sun, and you've got the desert stretching as far as you could see. And you walk down this ceremonial staircase, and it gets progressively darker and colder, and darker and colder. And once you're down in there, you're in another world. And it's a little bit scary, to be blunt. Okay. Kristin, you're going to be on this line. - Okay? - Yeah. Fire 'em up. The minute that your head goes underwater and you start pulling yourself through that steel chute into the chamber, and you kind of realize the gravity of what's going on. And then you realize that the visibility's shot. You have to kind of navigate your way through that first chamber to get into the air pocket in the second chamber. And it's just like every sense is 110%. You are just wired and just trying to figure out what's gonna happen next. So you're going in with 19 now? - 19A. - 19A, you got it. All right. See you in a few minutes. 10:30. Kristin notes the time, to track how long Pearce Paul is working in the third chamber. If he's gone more than a few minutes, she'll have to go in and try to find him. We know that the second chamber of the burial suite beneath the pyramid has already collapsed at some point in history. And so there's no reason why other parts of that tomb can't collapse. When we first got back here from last year, the water was crystal clear. We came in into the tomb and came up, we thought there was an air pocket, the water was so clear that we just hit our heads and looked up and saw our bubbles going against the roof. What's... What's going on here? It was phenomenal. At first, Pearce Paul could clearly make out familiar landmarks... The niche that had housed flakes of gold. Decorative blocks cut from stone, and the burial itself, a mound of rocks that may still hold Nastasen's remains. But now, the visibility is next to nothing. Because of the rockfalls, because of the collapses, because of the sands that have blown into it, as soon as you start getting in there, you start stirring it up, and very quickly once we start working, it's zero visibility. It's as if you're doing it blindfolded, sometimes upside down, and you're just trying to do the best you can to understand the situation, and make this mental map. You are trying to find important things solely by touch. You cannot use your eyes, you cannot use any other sense but your touch and your mental memory. Wow. This is a shabti. It's buried with the king. And it's a person to help him in the afterlife, so he doesn't have to deal with the drudgery of day-to-day work. I like that it's painted. Yeah. It's great! Incredible condition. - Thank you. - You're welcome. The season so far, I'm most proud of that we get out of the tomb every day safely. Uh, that is number one. Number two, I really do think we're making progress. I think we're learning more every day. We're getting information that makes this worth it. So, there's a major gap in our understanding in the transition of this one kingdom, the people of Napata. After hundreds of years of burying their kings here, they just stop. Nastasen falls at a really important time for us. He is the last king buried at Nuri. Why do they stop? Why do they then move from one place to another, to another? Who makes those decisions? Because you don't bury yourself. The 4th century BC in Kush was a little bit of a turbulent time, and we see this in a number of different ways, including the locations of royal burials. A king's decision about where to build his pyramid probably had a lot of different motivations behind it. To investigate these motivations, and what could have caused this tumultuous time, archeologists Geoff Emberling and Sami Elamin are turning their attention from the elite to the ordinary. Nearby the royal temple that hosted coronations for a long line of kings and pharaohs, Geoff and his colleagues are unearthing a town that hasn't seen daylight in thousands of years. I've always loved digging settlements. I'm always just interested in how everybody lived, and not just how the kings lived. I don't know, I kind of don't trust those people, those kings. And I would rather be able to tell history in a way that included all of us and all of them. Geoff has been excavating royal temples and burials around Jebel Barkal for 14 years. But he'd always wondered where the people who built the structures and supported the elite lived. He knew there must have been a town nearby, long ago buried under the sand. Those are the kinds of questions that keep me going as an archeologist. What is it that we don't know that's under our feet? As building walls, streets, and alleys emerge from the sand, Geoff and his team can begin to piece together what this ancient city would have looked like. Yeah. In the shadow of Jebel Barkal, at least 10 large buildings would have been anchors to different neighborhoods, dividing the city into districts. Homes are organized into city blocks, an early indication of urban planning. What happened inside the homes may give a glimpse into how prosperous the people of Napata actually were. The section of the city Geoff is excavating seems to have been organized around a big building, with smaller structures around it. We're looking at the outer wall of this building. It goes down, it turns a corner, and so the... the building is extending off in this direction. We're hoping to find whatever it is that they were doing and making in this building, and you can't predict what that's going to be. But we expect that underneath our feet goes down centuries, if not 1,000 years. There's a series of rooms in between these walls. And then, that's the outside of the building where the pile of sand is, and that's where we start to find objects that were related to the use of the building. That's where the, frankly, the garbage was, and that's what tells us what people were doing here. One of the town garbage pits indicates an ancient storeroom, which would have kept food, oils, and other essentials. Centuries later, the tossed away lids and labels that sealed the jars reveal more than meets the eye. Literally we found thousands of sealings in the pit here, which is very interesting. And I will pull one out here which was excavated this season here. It's made of clay and it's a jar stopper. That's on the top of the jar. You have cloth beneath and we have this lump of clay above in order to close the jar. And when you have done that, you will take your golden ring like this one here and you will stamp the jar stopper with your... with your ring in order to preserve the sealing here. So, if you look closely through the magnifier you will be able to see the seal impression once in a while. Each town official had his own ring, with its own unique image, a personalized seal to verify oversight and responsibility for the contents inside. But we have a nice example, one of the other sealings here. If you look closely here, you can see you have this elongated figure here and we think actually it's lion head over here. And you can see the half ring over here as well. That's another sealing as well. That would be the head of the crocodile, we think. For Geoff, the seal impressions are evidence of a complex economic system, that may help reconstruct the royal power structure at Jebel Barkal. As the team digs deeper, they'll reach older layers of the town, and even more ancient clues as to how society operated. This season, we've got down to probably the 3rd century BC. So, probably the next level down is going to be the time of Nastasen. And it's very possible that we might find seal impressions with names of kings. Maybe even names of kings we don't know about. So there are possible ways that we could fill in that history. Of course, we can't guarantee that we'll find those, but they're here somewhere. Soon after Nastasen's reign, around 315 BC, the Kushites moved their center of political power away from Napata. The forces behind this shift remain a mystery, but the archeologists are beginning to rule out one major possibility. You can get indications of how prosperous a time and place was based on the burials of people, right? Especially the burials of your kings. If the most powerful and important person in your society is buried in a very modest way, it would suggest that either there is a cultural shift of some kind toward this sort of modesty, or that the resources weren't available. Nastasen's tomb isn't that. There are pretty good indications that he had all of the needs and equipments and resources that a king would have, and that he was well-equipped for the afterlife. Good morning. How are you? - Good, how are you doing? - Good. We had a pretty good day yesterday. Yeah? How good of a day? Pretty good. You want to come see? Yeah, I do. We got some interesting things out. Oh, wow. Yeah. So... - I think... - It's still got some gold on it. It would have been gold-leafed. - Yep. - It's got some more here and once we have it cleaned, more will come off underneath. That's gorgeous. If this is what we think it is, I'm only aware of one other really prominent example of this. So, it makes it an essential discovery. Have you seen the Hemén and Taharqa statuette in the Louvre? - Yes. - It's got Taharqa sitting, making offerings to the bird god? I think that's what this is. So there should be a little statue - of Nastasen making offerings. - ...offerings. So, we need to go find - the pair of Nastasen. - Nastasen. Okay, that's the mission. - Yep. - The mission taken on here. Wow. Over the next few days, the team pulls an increasing amount of evidence from the tomb, pointing to a burial of a king who wanted to be revered and remembered. All righty, we've got another box. - Okay. - For eight, bucket is eight. Okay. Okay. Shabti. All right. - Yeah, and charcoal. - Charcoal. - Yeah. - Okay. Bits of charcoal could be evidence of a burnt offering made at the time of the burial. I've got more charcoal here. - I've got a good amount of charcoal. - Charcoal. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! - Whoa! - Yeah! That's the biggest piece of gold I've seen! Biggest piece of gold. Yeah. Gold foil that would have covered objects like the statue of the falcon god. - Beautiful. - I win? - No, you win. - Yes, you do win. You win. Yep. Gold, gold. That piece of gold. Oop, more gold. Here I'm leaving you a gift. It's the bag. - Day of gold. - Day of gold. - Ah, there's some more right there. - Yeah. Yeah. Day of gold. Oh, hey. The biggest bone I've found yet. Oh, yeah. As we get closer to the central parts of the tomb, we started to find pieces of bone that are darkened. And yes, this could be from having been burned or charred, but this can be what happens to bones underwater. See that, what, is that leather maybe, or...? - Here? - It's in the mud. Yeah. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. More leather. Yeah, that's leather. - Okay, that's beautiful. - Yeah. We got out what we think are some pieces of leather, and if these are pieces of leather, that would be consistent with the types of burials from this time and place, in which they might have been put on or wrapped in a hide mat. If that's what this is, then it's another good indication that yeah, the king was, or is, here. With each day of discovery at Nuri, Pearce Paul is getting closer to honing in on what might be the burial, and body, of king Nastasen. As of today, the tomb looks something like this. You've got the niche up here. The entry. So this is the third chamber. We have some... a very large slab. I think this is a fall from the roof. Now, yesterday, because we moved a lot of the blocks from inside the burial chamber, things got a lot clearer. What we have is a basically flat tabletop. It feels like... It's so-- It's so shockingly flat. It feels intentional. But this piece is big enough so that when I'm laying on top of it with my arms and legs spread out, I can barely touch the corners of all four at the same time. So it's massive. Through his finds and careful mapping of their locations, Pearce Paul is able to reconstruct what he'd be seeing in the tomb if the water were clear, centered around the area where Nastasen may lie. So you have a big slab in the middle of the room. There's one rock left here, one piece standing up against the wall. This fell after the burial, because there is a shabti stuck under the corner of it. So the shabtis are actually lined up along two walls. We found a bunch of them in place here. And then they've been along the wall like this, every couple of inches all the way down. The falcon deity was over here, and it wasn't directly on the floor. And through out of here we got bone fragments, and we got what looks to be big patches of leather. If the king is in there, it makes sense for him to be in the middle of the room, and so he should be underneath this slab. Progress has been great. The goal had been to... to complete the excavation this season. I don't think we'll make it, in part because we're finding too much, which is a terrible and wonderful problem to have. If you think of it in some ways, archeology is kind of like trying to figure out an ancient crime scene, right? Everybody's dead. Nobody can speak for themselves. And all you have is the physical evidence around it. But instead of spent shotgun shells, you've got pottery and inscriptions, and all these wonderful pieces of puzzle that you really have to patiently put together. Gosh, look at the visibility. I can even see bubbles - in there on occasion. - I know. So, you know... Pearce Paul and Kristin review some of the footage of Nastasen's tomb to assess whether there's a possibility he's still inside. - ...had been gilded... - Mm-hmm. ...that then got squished... The rockfalls in the tomb block them from getting a clear picture. But it could also be a stroke of luck. How many... How many falls you think you got there? At least two. What I'm hoping is is that the things coming down from the ceiling, yes, they crush some stuff, - but they also push it out. - ...from in. Yeah. We found some shattered parts of bone, probably human. - We found gold leaf, we found leather. - Mm-hmm. We found a little statuette of a deity. So essentially, you're dealing with a tomb tsunami, in some sense. Yes. It's great, because I think the likelihood is high that there's more there, there, because it's protected. - Mm-hmm. - Smushed, but protected. I can imagine that this gigantic slab has prevented anybody else since that event occurred from doing anything to get to whatever is underneath it... - Yeah. - ...which is in the center of the room, - which is where all these burials are. - Which is... Yes. Which is where Nastasen - should be if he's in there. - Should be. Yeah. Now we just have to figure out... What's the technical way to do it, if at all, which is also one of the questions. Is this a thing that we can do today, or is it a thing that we leave to someone else in the future? For immediate gratification, that's disappointing, because you've got a big rock in the way. But for our long term prospects, it's really intriguing. We may have Nastasen still inside that tomb. After Nastasen's reign, and the mysterious move from Napata, the Kushites began a new era. While still prosperous for centuries, the kingdom's power would never again extend as far as it had when it ruled Egypt. It is a really engaging time in human history and it's these foundations, these things that we look back in our own history books and say, "Gosh, these are important events in our world, too." For nearly 2,000 years, temples were built and rebuilt at the foot of Jebel Barkal. While the mountain's center of power didn't last forever, its spirit endures today. These places and these kings of Kush are still really significant in modern Sudan, but it's beyond just history. It's a very rich connection that Sudanese have to these places. They all know about their historical importance, but they're also a part of their daily lives. The people are very connected to the mountain itself initially. But in the recent years with the wave of archeological discoveries, the people have become more interested in the history and in the antiquities, and they now ask a lot of questions about the antiquities and the history and the civilization as well. One thing that archeology teaches us as we look over the centuries is that things really do go wrong. Cultures do collapse, civilizations disappear. One of the things I take from studying archeology and history, is that the decisions that we make really matter.
