Now, are you gonna tell me what this is all about? I think I can handle it from here. Catherine, what are you doing? That's not catherine, dad. That's a cop. Lieutenant laurent, paris judicial police. Lucy cunningham and antoine verdier, You're both under arrest. When I said some of them are in on it, I meant her. She's helping remy frame me, dad. Your daughter is paranoid, monsieur, and a killer. Get down to the ground and put your hands behind your head! -Run, honey. -Move from-- -Go! Go! -Stop! Move! Oh! Oh! You want to play the big american hero? Fine. -You can do it from a jail cell! -[grunts] [lucy panting] [antoine panting] I can't believe we just left him there. We didn't have a choice. He knew what he was doing. Getting himself thrown into jail? Protecting his daughter, like parents are supposed to do. What's wrong? I just remembered something your mom said. "I will do anything to help antoine." This is all about your mother. What do you mean? Don't you get it? She's the key. If we can convince her to turn on remy, That helping you means helping me, Then his whole plan falls apart. It's worth a try. But...How do we get her away from him? She'll have to go out eventually, And when she does, we'll follow. Okay. [birds chirping] Remy? [sniffles] [sniffles] So...This was your secret. Antoine. You wouldn't understand. Then explain it to us. Explain why you had to help remy frame me for murder. I'm truly sorry, lucy. I'm sorry, but you shouldn't be with him. You should leave here and forget you ever met my son. Excuse me? You know what I'm talking about. This...This whole thing between the two of you. We are in love, maman. Oh, please, antoine, what you're feeling isn't real. It's just the excitement of doing something That is against the rules. You shouldn't be with her. I shouldn't be with her? You shouldn't be with him. Oh, come on, antoine. You know the situation. No, I don't believe it! Whatever he thinks of me, I'm still his son. No. You're not. [cries] [gasps] gaston...Was your father. Your real father. I was already pregnant with you when I met remy, But I had money problems, really bad ones. So... Remy promised to solve them, But only if I left gaston for him. Remy knew I'd never stop loving gaston. So, we had our understanding. I would never see him again. And no one would ever know antoine was another man's son. As time passed, I grew lonely. And gaston soon refused to stay in the shadows. Remy...Remy threatened to tell the truth. You never told me. Never let me know my real father. I couldn't. [sniffles] Antoine, please forgive me. [exhales deeply] I couldn't bear to have you hate me. Antoine, please. [sobbing] You could still stop this. Tell the police the truth that remy did it And that you lied about what you saw because you were scared. Remy: That's right, madeliene. Tell them just how scared you were. -[grunts] -antoine! [grunting] Antoine! Tell them. [antoine coughs] What I threatened to do to your son If you say one more bad word about me, what I might still do. Lucy: Madeliene? Oh. Look at that. Fear is the most powerful motivator of all. You may scare her, but you don't scare me. No? -Let's see about that. -[gasps] Wait! Oh! Bring her to fontainebleau forest. If they find the body, I assure you, they will never find yours. Oui. [gasps] [gasps] antoine. [sobbing] antoine. Antoine. [exhaling deeply] Lucy. Where is she? You're awake. What did you do to her? Tell me. You mean, uh... The murderer you've been helping escape from justice? You are the murderer. You killed my real father. So madeliene told you. Did she also tell you That he was trying to extort money from me? That he was a 3-time loser? Common criminal of the lowest and most pathetic kind? Shut up! Or I swear to god I'll cut you! [snickers] Don't be ridiculous. Put that thing down before you hurt yourself. I'll do it! If you kill me... You'll never find her. She will disappear, Like so many other naive young women, Who are stupid enough to fall in love with the wrong man. Just ask your mother. Have you hurt her, too? I haven't done anything to either of them. But that could change. So, control yourself. Put this down. [panting] [clatter] [speaking french] Hmm? [panting] You've done the right thing for once, my boy. I just want to see her. Sure. Yeah. We'll talk about that when you wake up next time. [gasps] [buzzing] [thud] Maybe by then, you'll be a bit more reasonable. What's happening now? No. [gasps] no, no. Antoine! Antoine! It was just supposed to be the girl! You promised it was just supposed to be the girl! -It is just the girl. -You're a liar! You promised me! -I'm not a liar, madeliene. -You're a liar! -Calm down! -A liar! -Madeliene, calm down! -[buzzing] [sighs heavily] [under breath] so stupid. [engine turns off] [keys jangle] Psst. Wake up. Come on, hurry. Hurry! Hurry up. Stay here. Wait, wait, wait. Let's go. [telephone ringing, siren wailing in distance] [door closes] [footsteps] It's about time. Let me outta here. You seem to have trouble understanding What is happening here, monsieur. You are a foreign national Who has aided and abetted a wanted criminal. This is a serious offense. Now...I would like nothing better than To reunite you with your daughter, But to do that, I have to find her. So, you need to cooperate. I wanna talk to somebody at my embassy. And don't try to tell me that I can't. I spent a lot of time in foreign ports When I was in the navy, and I know my rights. You give me my phone call first, and then I'll help you. Finally, I found it again. Sit here. Sit here. Okay? Sit down. Yeah? Don't move! If you move, I break your pretty face, okay? Don't move. I just need to finish digging this, And then... We will do what needs to happen, okay? I don't wanna die! [sobbing] [thud] [continues sobbing] [continues sobbing] [sobs] [continues sobbing] -My god. -[continues sobbing] Stop crying. -Just stop crying, huh? -[continues sobbing] Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be. Stop crying, please! Okay. Aah! [grunting] Christoph: Where are you?! Come back! I'll kill you! Where are you?! [christoph grunts] I'll kill you! Come back! [christoph grunts] Christoph: Where are you?! [yells indistinctly] [engine starts] [yells] no! -No! -[shovel thuds] [laurent speaks french] Okay. [sighs] I understand. Uh, thanks anyway. [receiver clatters] I told you they wouldn't help. I had to try. She's my only daughter. All the more reason to help me find her. Oh, yeah, about that. I think lucy was right. I don't think I can trust you. So, if you want to find her, you'll have to do it without me. I hope you have a good lawyer. Oh, yeah, the best. His name is reuben. [siren wailing in distance] Monsieur... [speaks french] [antoine speaks french over recording] -[beep] -antoine, it's lucy. I knew you wouldn't recognize this number and pick up, but... [sniffles] I hope you're okay. I got away from remy's thug. [breathes shakily] I found this phone in his glove compartment, And... Don't worry. I... [sniffles] ...Ditched the car somewhere no one will ever find it. [sniffles] I'm going to get help from you-know-who, And then we're gonna come for you. I promise. [in french] [inhales and exhales sharply] Lucy: [over recording] I'm going to get help from you-know-who, And then we're gonna... I'm going to get help from you-know-who, And then we're gonna come for you. You-know-who. [sighs] vincent. [line rings] Yeah. I need you to do something for me. Lucy? What are you doing here? Antoine's in trouble. [breathing heavily] I would love to help you. I would, but I just can't get back to jail. I get that, but remy's the one pulling the strings. He's behind all this. You, me, and antoine, If we take him down, then all of this goes away. -[knock on door] -[scoffs] What else can happen today? Bernard: [singsongy] vincent. That's bernard. That's-- that's my parole officer. Antoine said he works for remy. If he finds me here... [pounding on door] Bernard: Open up, vincent! We need to talk! -I have to let him in. -I have to hide. Come on, vincent. I know you're in there. [door creaks] Oh, hi, bernard. Do you want to talk about something? Because I have some things I want... -Where is she? -Who? Lucy cunningham. The girl. Lucy? Lucy? You mean the--the american chick staying with my cousin? Don't play dumb with me, When I know she was on her way here, And I know she was at your little party the other day. Now, if you're hiding her... I mean, come on, man, what's your deal? You're branching out on harassing women now? -[loud smack] -[grunts] Shut your mouth! I own you. [grunting] Vincent. Vincent. Vincent. Now... Now we're gonna stay here and wait for her to show up. -Is she really that dangerous? -I said shut up. Because if she is, perhaps I should get a weapon, too. You know what? [dog barking in distance] It's actually a brilliant idea. [gun clatters] Nice, ah? [click] Go on. Pick it up. I said pick...It...Up. Really? You're going to kill us both because my uncle said so? You know, your uncle is a very influential man. I do that for him, I get a nice chunk of cash, And I'm out of this rat race. Now...Are you going to pick up the knife... Or am I going to plant it on your body after I shoot you? [exhales deeply] [sighs] Still worried about going to jail? [chuckles] [clicking] It's locked. [sighs] What? Can't you pick it? I thought you were a criminal. Well, I'm a former criminal. Can you pick the lock or not? Yeah, I can. Of course I can. [grunting] [breathing heavily] [footsteps approach] [door opens in distance] [footsteps depart] [grunting] [grunting] [thud] [continues grunting] [breathing heavily] [grunting] [clatter] Maman. [breathing heavily] [singsongy] lucy. Come on, lucy. [panting] Is that you? [singsongy] lucy! [clicking tongue] [panting] Lucy. [panting] Antoine? [panting] Um, I thought... I know. Lucy. [panting] [singsongy] lucy. -[thwack] -[grunts] [grunting] Don't you even think about it. Guys, I have him! [panting] [speaks french] You all right? Still breathing, cousin? No thanks to him. -Antoine... -I don't want to hear it. You tried to kill lucy, and you're trying to kill us. No. If I wanted you and your mother dead, I would have done it already. I just want us to be together. I want us to be a family again, Like we always were. And that can still happen. You just need... To stop with this--this girl And listen to me. I know I'm not your real father. But I'm the one who's always been there for you, Your whole life. You have to think about it. I'm the one who's always been there. So, please, when she's out of the way, Everything can go back to normal. No. Never again. Laurent: Drop it! Now! [whispers] good night, vincent. [thud] Excellent timing, you know. And now... This needs to disappear. I need you to take care of them. It depends on what you mean by take care of them. What do you think I mean? The girl who was desperate? She convinced the convicted criminal, vincent, To help her take me hostage. Misguided attempt to... Earn their freedom. You arrived while we were struggling, Saw their weapons, And you shot them both in self-defense. Look, planting dna And helping you manipulate the investigation was one thing, But now you're asking me to commit murder. Oh. How disappointing. [chuckles] That doesn't sound like someone Who wants to be commandant à division. You have to step up, you know. The hardest decisions are the ones Where what's right and what we want Are two different things. I wish the real world was as black and white As you seem to think it is, miss cunningham. Then do it. Lucy, please. Go ahead. Come on. Shoot her. [inhales sharply] Well... [gasps] Come on. Come on. [exhales deeply] I think it's time you clean up your own mess. Oh, yeah? Yeah, you're right. [both grunting] [gunshot] [gasps] [thud] Lucy... You shot a police officer. [clicking tongue] And then you tried to kill me. We wrestled for the gun, And in the confusion, it went off. You think they'll believe that? I'm an examining magistrate with the best prosecution record In the history of the ministry. Who will dare to question me? [laughs] Madeliene: I will. And I'll make sure they do it, too. I'll tell them everything. Every last sordid detail. You...Ungrateful-- [grunting] Antoine! [grunting] -[buzzing] -[yells] [thud] [panting] Lucy? [gasps] I owe you an apology, ma chérie. No. I would do just about anything for your son, too. ♪♪♪ So... Reuben at the state department. Yeah. It seemed right to call him, not the embassy. And he calls, and things get done. You were right. Of course I was right. I'm your daughter. -Let me help it. -Thank you, antoine. Thank you so much. Give me your-- Oh, one more. [grunts] I cannot wait to get home. After all the trouble we've caused? All right. Well, I'll--I'll hop in and let you guys say Your goodbyes in private. So... You're leaving? [car door closes] Yeah. There's an expression in english. "a picture is worth a thousand words." [exhales deeply] This is how I see you, lucy cunningham. I'm gonna miss you. Yeah. Until I get to america. What? Next semester. I decided I want to see the world. Time to get out on your own, huh? No, actually... I've realized... I never want to be alone again. Me neither. ♪♪♪
