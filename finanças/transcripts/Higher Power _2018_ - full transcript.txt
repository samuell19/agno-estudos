Subtitles by explosiveskull I know about your work. I know they turned their back on it. What if I told you I had a plan? A plan to finally see it come to life. Because I know for a fact that it's the only thing powerful enough to stop what's coming. The end. Joining us today is astrophysicist Michael Swaford from MIT's Kavli Institute for Space Research to discuss his new book, In the End There Was Light. Welcome to the show. This light you describe as, "The brightest and most violent event in our known universe", is what, exactly? It's a gamma ray burst or a GRB. And you believe, Mr. Swaford, that this light, this gamma ray burst is the last thing that mankind will see before we are blown out of existence? Yes. That's correct. Where do they come from, these GRBs, and how are they made? When a high mass star collapses, gravity crushes its core into a black hole. This black hole immediately begins to devour the dying star around it at a rate of 1 million Earth masses per second. Now that's far too much energy for the black hole to consume at once, so a majority of that energy is blasted back out into the universe. In the form of two narrow beams of intense radiation. And you believe, Mr. Swaford, that there is a dying star right here in our own Milky Way Galaxy, AWR104 - that could be a likely GRB candidate? - Yes, that's right. And that Earth is lying directly in the path of the beam zone. We are essentially staring down the barrel of a gun. Hey, you know, I've been thinking of a couple of names. Oh yeah? Let's hear them. What about Rhea? You know, like a ray of light? Rhea. Rhea Steadman. I love it. What about if it's a boy? Oh, that's easy. Joe Junior. - What? - Yeah, I don't think so. Yes! Come on. Uh-uh. Zoe Lorraine, let's go! S'more time. No, no, I got her. Wait, you forgot a prize. - A prize? - This one. It's got magic powers that make you strong. Thank you. I always wanted magic powers. I spy a secret light! I spy a secret light. Okay. - Is it that one? - No. - Is it that one? - You win! You know that's a lighthouse, right? Check this out. Watch how it blinks. One four three. That stands for... I. L. O. V. E. Y. O. U. One four three. - What does that spell? - I love you! I love you, too, baby girl. Primary subject: Joseph Steadman. Forty-five. DNA analysis concludes possible match. - Further testing required. - What's up, man? Anytime bro. Undergoing psychiatric treatment for depression, suicidal tendencies and recurring anger control issues. And the anger. Have we maintained control? Yeah. Yeah, definitely. I... - You remember what happened last time. - I know. Yes, it's... That's never gonna happen again. I'm doing work. I am, really. Remember, if it starts to happen you have to... Think with my head before my heart. - I know. - Precisely. - Precisely. - You're in control of your emotions. They're not in control of you. His condition remains unstable. Zoe Steadman. Daughter of test subject. Twenty-five. Unable to forgive her father after the mother's death, when he left. Surprise! I got take-out. Currently putting herself through nursing school. I didn't hear you come in. - She's headstrong... - It's okay. - ...independent and self-sufficient. - It's my favorite. A direct contrast to her younger sister, Rhea Steadman. Substance abuse. Started at seventeen. When she decided to follow in her father's footsteps. Zoe's attempts at reaching out have been met with resistance. Opiates, I'm afraid, have twisted her perspective. Lost would be the best way to describe her current situation. I know you're in there. Just one more time. I... I promise. Just don't do this to me. I told you I'm done with that shit. Pretty please? I miss your touch, baby. I've got eyes on Subject B. She just entered the library on 2nd Street. Intercepting the security camera feed now. Okay, the image should be up. What do we have here? The Anatomy and Physiology of Health and Illness. Oh, sounds like a page-turner. So are we done here? Can we go? There's one more. Oh, goody. So, Dr. Apocalypse, I um... Finally finished it. Your book. Oh, good. I'll just be over here... No, it's just you're... you're surprisingly chipper for someone who thinks we're all gonna get wiped out by... What'd you call it? A cosmic beam of concentrated energy? I'm impressed. That's good. But you know what? Uh, I've actually been doing a lot of thinking lately and don't tell anybody else about this but just recently somebody really inspiring came into my life. And they kind of changed the way that I look at things. - Really? How so? - Hmm. Well, I guess you could say that they convinced me of the possibility of a more optimistic future for mankind. Oh, shhh. Sorry. - Look! Fate page. - What? - What? - When a book falls like that it's a fate page. Me and my sister, we used to play this game. We kind of just dropped them on purpose And see what page they open up to. - Uh-huh. - Okay, wait. Just close your eyes. Just do it. Just close your eyes. - Okay, so you take your finger. - Mhm. - Pick it up. - Mhm. You move it kind of around the page. - Okay. - Circle it. And you just drop it down. Okay, don't move it. You can open your eyes. It's kind of like a fortune. You can see how it applies to your life. What does it say? During an infection, apoptosis, whatever the hell that is, can serve a protective function by killing off virus-contaminated cells before they spill over with virus particles. This act of self-sacrifice hampers the spread of infection and can save the whole organism. That is completely not informative. No, you have to look past the words. You know, like... Like maybe you're the apoptosis - serving a protective function. - Oh! Right. That is such a sound theory. You know what? I think I saw the mental health section back there. - We should probably just go... - Okay. - ...take a gander over there. What do you think? - Got you. And how is the job-hunt going? - Any luck? - I landed a front desk gig at this government funded facility. It's... I don't know I didn't even apply. They uh, I don't know, they got my name, They contacted me and... Thought it was kind of weird but... you know, whatever. It's good pay and benefits so... A year sober, a new job, a new man. It's all good stuff. Well, everyone, this is a special evening. Joe, come on up here and get your one-year chip. I guess I should thank my higher power. Um... I don't really know who or whatever that is yet. I remember when my wife was sick and uh... After she died I prayed all the time. There was no voice coming back to me. There were no answers, There were no nothing. And I ended up stranding my kids out to sea. I don't blame them for hating me. I mean, I'd hate me too. Uh... But I got to believe that in their hearts they still want their dad. I don't know. I can do better. I can be better. Buddy! Hello! Oh, where are my kisses? - Good boy! Oh, hello! - Hi. Welcome home, Dad! - You got a little taller. - Little bit, little bit. Where's your sister? - Oh, she's uh, she's up there. - Oh Dad, you stink. - What's with this? - It's for a school project. You wanna know what it's about now? No, no. Come here and give me a hug. No, you smell. - Look. - No. No! - Here. - Stop it. Don't chase your child. All right, so what is this report on? Uh, it's on professions and I chose yours. - Can I ask you a few questions? - No, wait, wait! - Wait. Here it is. - Abso... - Wait Rhea I was gonna... Just one second. - She baked a cake. Be right with you. Say your name and your profession. - You need to say it into the camera. - Hi. My name is Joseph Steadman. I am a deck hand on a commercial fishing boat. What do you do in your off-time when you're... When you're not working? Uh... Mostly I think about this. Being here. Being home. You know, you guys. So I'm just wondering, like, at one point you're gonna have to take, like, a bedpan test? - Like, do you guys have... - Do you... do you really think that's a real thing? You need to be pretty experienced at that. - I mean, it's a very delicate situation... - What do you think nursing is? ...just dumping them out there for ya. Just saying, things that will make you a better nurse - at the end of the day. - Yeah, that's abs... - Oh, shit. - What? - Hey, Zoe. - That's my dad. I got a year sober today. I uh, thought maybe we could uh... go to dinner, maybe talk. I got you something. Am I embarrassing you? Dad, why don't you go try this with Rhea? She needs it. You think coming here with presents is gonna help? Okay, no, no, no, listen, listen, listen. I... I'm trying. And you know, I... I can't get through to Rhea. Not by myself. Maybe we could, uh, do it together. Maybe the three of us like a family. Can we just leave? Can we go? Alright, well I just want you to have this. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Look, why don't you just give her some space? She's obviously just not into it right now. - Alright, listen. I just... - Hey, you are. - I am what? - You are embarrassing her. - Get your fucking hands off me! - Dad! - Dad, just stop! - What's your problem? Christ! - Stop! Stop! - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Jesus Christ! - I'm sorry! No, it wasn't him, it's you! It's always you! It's the same shit! You're never gonna change. Zoe. Zoe! I... Come on, Rhea. Pick up. I got you that phone so you would use it. Okay, please? Sis, I'm here. Just... Don't forget, okay? I don't understand. She was doing so well. We talked every Sunday for the last three months. She's using again. Look, just give her some time, all right? I know she's gonna call. You know? You don't know anything about me, Michael. I mean, why are you even still here? My dad just punched you in the face. No, look. Hey, it's okay. I'm here because I love you, all right? God, you don't wanna get sucked into this. I'm like a fucking black hole. No. You are not a black hole, Zoe. Your dad is. And unlike him I'm not going anywhere. All right? It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Rhea. Rhea, it's me. Uh... Uh, I fucked up. Can you call me? I, uh... I wanna fix this. Just call me. I'm not scared anymore, baby. I've accepted it. And I need you to do the same. You just have to believe like I do. Believe you're the man that I see. I need you to be strong for our girls. And you keep our family together when I'm gone. Don't say that. You're not going anywhere. Joe... Please. Promise me. I promise. I'm sorry, baby. I messed everything up. I lost 'em. Gentlemen. We are at zero hour. Open your eyes, Joseph Steadman. But everybody calls you Joe, don't they? What... When your wife died you reached out for a God. But no one answered. You wanted someone to tell you what to do. To tell you what to do. I remember when my wife was sick And uh... She died. I prayed all the time. And uh, there was no voice coming back to me. I did not know what to do. I did not know what to do. I did not know what to do. I did not know what to do. We're transmitting a data burst through a device we placed on your optic nerve. It allows us to see what you see. And you to see what we want you to. In this case your drug addict daughter, Rhea. Now you see the consequences of your actions, Joe. Look at how you influenced her. She's about to score her next hit. I've been watching your family for some time now, Joe. Why did you give up so easily? - No! - You're not fixing anything! - It's broken, all of it. - Stop! Lost because you weren't strong enough to hold it together. - Get out of my head! - Broken promises, Joe. Broken family, smashed down by your unstable hands. It's got magic powers to keep you strong. And I can help you find your strength to put those - pieces back together. - I always wanted magic powers. But first, you have to answer me, Joe. Do you believe in me? Come on, honey. Turn it off. Answer me, Joe. Yes. What do you want? Hello? - Help me! - What happened? I need you to lift that firearm And shoot this woman in the head. - Are you ok? - Call the police. Please! - Help me! He... - Tell me what happened. - Now, Joe. - I don't know just please help me. You're gonna be fine. Or I'm gonna put a bullet in your daughter's head. No! No, please! Okay, anything. - What? - Please, don't hurt her. Then do as I say. You've got exactly five seconds. - I can't do this. - Wait, who are you talking to? Five. - Okay, okay, okay, okay! - Four. - No, stop! - I'm sorry. - Don't do this! No! - Three. - I'm sorry. - Don't! Two. I'm sorry. I guess, I should thank my higher power. Honestly, I don't really know who or whatever that is yet. Remember this, Joe. I am your higher power. And you will surrender to me. We have big plans for you. - Report. - Ready, Doctor. Jesus Christ. Help! Help me! Oh no! Shit, shit, shit. 9-1-1. - What's the nature of your emergency? - Yes, I've been kidnapped! There's a man, he's watching my daughters and I... If you contact the authorities in any way again... - We will kill them. - Wait. Wait, no! Oh, fuck! - Do you understand? - Yes! Yes, yes, yes. I understand. I understand. Good. Now look inside the car. - You see the backpack? - Yes. You'll need a few items for this next assignment. Please just show them to me. Please, I just need to know that they're safe. - I swear to god, if you... - Shut up and turn on the car. - Just... Leave... - Now, Joe. Drive. Rhea, it's a grocery bagging job. They don't care how you look. They'd hire you if you had a nose ring - on the back of your head. - Hey, everybody cares what I look like. Besides, how much longer can you possibly stand me sleeping on your couch for? - That's very true. - Seriously, though. - Thanks for letting me stay with you. - Always. Look in the bag. Take out the tablet. You recognize this man? Yeah, that's Charles Margrey. He's the president of Redlock, where I work. Now you know who to look for. Grab your bag, we're moving in. Don't forget your mask. Place the small black box on the security panel. - All right, we're in. - It's time to see what you're made of. What am I doing here? You're insane. I can't do this. You're wasting time, Joe. Go upstairs to the third floor. - He's in the room at the end of the hall. - All right. Okay. Impressive, isn't it? Charles Margrey had a simple idea that put him on the map. How do we beat the Soviets in Afghanistan? We arm and fund the mujahideen to fight them. The politicians called it genius. Seven years later the Soviets were defeated. They gave this terrorist keys to his own weapons research facility as a reward. Thirteen years later two towers fell in Manhattan. Take a good, long, hard look around, Joe. This is what death can buy you. Look in the bag. You're gonna put that gun to his head. Threaten his life unless he opens his safe. Get him to open the safe on the second floor. - All right. - Now move! Get up! Get up! What the hell is going on? - Take me to your safe! - Take it easy with that gun. - Just take me to your safe on the second floor, goddammit! - Okay, okay, all right. - Get up! Let's go! - Okay. Come on. In the safe. Get it. The laptop on the center shelf. Get the laptop on the center shelf. Just grab it. Come on. - Tell him to authorize it. - Authorize it. Authorization Charles Margrey delta one zero two six. Put your finger on the tray. Back up. You were right, Doctor. It is him. Wow. - Look at that. - That's impossible. Take the small metallic LED device from your backpack. - Who the hell are you? - Place it on the laptop. All right. Okay, the data is transferred and I have a cloned copy of all your work coming up. Good, Joe. We have what we need. - Tell him to get on his knees. - No. You said no one was gonna get hurt. - I said no such thing. - No, I'm not gonna do that. - We lost his optics feed. - I need it powered on. - Give me a second. - Joe. Wait. Wait. No, no, no. It's me, Joe. Joe Steadman. - I work at the facility. - Joe? - Okay, the link is established. - You're the match? - Jesus. - Trust me. Believe me. There is a man and he's in my head and he's talking to me. You have to believe... Optics implant. You're watching me right now, aren't you, you crazy bastard? I shut down the program for a reason. - It's too dangerous. - Walk forward now, Joe, or he will kill you. - Tell him he's right. - He says you're right. - It is too dangerous. - It is too dangerous. For him. Now, take out the clippers. We'll be needing his thumb. - I'm not like you. - No? Then save your daughter's life. Take the clippers and cut off his fucking thumb! Joe! It's 8:40. - Man, where you been? - I know, I'm sorry man. - Everything okay? - Yeah. It's all right, I just... I got caught up in some stuff. - Sure? You sure? - I'm sure, Frank. Now take off. Alright, buddy. See ya. Grab the equalizing mask from your bag and put it on now. Yeah, that went well. Let's follow up next week. Hey, what's with the mask? What're you... what're you doing? It's called B-19... a classified undetectable chemical weapon. That immediately bonds with air particles on a subatomic level creating a controlled seismic vacuum. - Hey! Hey, make it stop! - Ironic. These men invested millions into the project. But you're missing the best part, Joe. Watch. Their deaths were necessary. Hers, on the other hand, can be spared. That's if you make it to the main facility in time. You have four minutes. That's not enough time! That's your problem, isn't it? Where do I go? No. No, no, no! What did you do? Their lives mean nothing in comparison to the bigger picture, Joe. Through this door here. Then grab one of their key cards. The main facility is straight ahead. The gas has dissipated. You can take off the mask now, Joe. We've lost audio. Hurry, Joe. 153 seconds. Hold on. I need to disable the alarm. - What? - Got it. Resetting audio now. Where do I go? - Straight ahead. - Where? What? I can't... I can't hear you! Where do I go? Where do I go! What? Alright, the link is established. Straight ahead, then left. Okay. Stairs dead ahead. Take the LED device and snap it in. - Sorry. - 43 seconds. Okay. The device to the right of the console is a thumbprint scanner. You'll need the thumb. That's where it goes. Doctor, we have access to the core. Is she safe? Is she okay? Answer me! Answer me! One last thing. Just inside there's a throw switch. Switch it on and she lives. Okay, we got it. The generators are up. Turn it over to me. I'm sending him in. Okay. My work deserves to be completed, Joe. Open the door. Open the door! Oh! Stop! Help! Why are you doing this to me? Because that's the way the numbers line up. - It's in your DNA. - Please! And when the universe decides what it wants... It's pointless to resist. In five... ...four, three, two... So just... One. ...embrace it. Was it successful? Zoe, it's gonna be okay. It's not gonna be okay! He's gone. I could have held him together. I should have never given up on him. If you are just joining us here is a recap of what we know right now. A horrific scene. A massive explosion that has destroyed a government research lab, Redlock. They have a long history of weapons research with the department of defense. Now early today authorities... ...acknowledged there were... ...rescue workers that have been... ...the cause of the explosion is still unknown. It was heard over a ten mile distance, shattering windows in the adjacent... ...they are still at this point searching for survivors. Senior management have refused to comment on whether or not weapons were in fact located at the facility, which could explain the level... You're here now, aren't you? What did you do to me? Where are you! The FBI has not determined whether or not... - Stop fucking with me! - There are four fundamental forces, Joe. - Gravity. Electromagnetism. - Why are you doing this to me! The strong nuclear force. The weak one. Weakness is something you're familiar with, - aren't you Joe? - I have to call... The weak force destroys, but through that decay we have the furnace of the sun that brings life. It's not work... fuck! Why are you doing this to me? I did what you asked me to! Let me see her! Let me talk to her... Leave us alone! What... What did you do to me? Oh God. Amazing. What's happening to me? I have blessed you, Joe. By taking your greatest weakness and turning it into a strength. The anger, the fear, the anxiety. That chaos living inside you that tore your life apart, I've harnessed it into a source of infinite power. And now I need you to use that power, Joe. To do what you've always wanted. To keep them together. To save your family's life. You were always meant for more, Joseph Steadman, But first you need to pass my tests designed specifically to unlock your greatest potential. But I need you to be strong. Show me how strong you really are. Now get on your feet. You have fifteen minutes to get to the next location. Alright. Whatever, you psycho. Just point me in the right direction. Fifteen minutes, Joe. And you'll need your gun. Alright, he's stabilizing. Where's my car? Where's my car? How do you... I can't get there without... Do you think there's someone out there? Your wife in heaven watching over you? There is no heaven, Joe. And your wife is dead. Look at that. The astonishing thing about electromagnetism... is that it has infinite range. Now you see how this works, Joe. The angrier you get, the more you unlock. Cause and effect. Now get on the bike. Alright. Where am I going? To see how far we can push it. Cause and effect. Okay. Then what? Once I'm at this place what do I do? You get inside and confront this man. - Who? - His name is Nico Sola. The man who took your daughter Rhea under his wing after you left. The same man who got her hooked and kept her that way. Cause and effect, Joe. Cause and effect. There are powers out there that are greater than us And we can't control. All we can do is... is let go. Back it up. Now! - You back it up! - Woah! - Relax. - Move! Hey! Hey! Are you Nico? Hey! Is your name Nico? - Smile! - Woah! Big bad wolf. Name! Steadman. Steadman? Steadman. You're Rhea's old man. Huh? Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. You don't understand. You just... There she is. You're gonna love this. You shouldn't do this. And... Action! You got some hero... fuckin' save the day thing going on, right? Oh!- Shit! That's your daughter, hero. You baked that? That's beautiful. And it has no egg in it, all natural. - That's the best. - Mmm-hmm. What the fuck are you? Somebody help! Die motherfucker! That's enough! What's happening! How am I doing this? You haven't done anything, Joe. - But I just... - You failed once again. The police are on their way. Turn yourself in. I need you to dig deeper, Joe. We need to unlock more. - Freeze! - Drop your weapon! - Okay, okay! Okay! - Put the gun on the ground. Now! - Get down! - Just don't wanna hurt anyone else! - I said get on the ground, now. - Stay away! Get on the ground! You don't understand. I'm dangerous. I don't know how to control this! You're making a mistake. Just wait! Wait! You don't understand! Gridlock was annihilated two days ago, taking out half a city block. Now this shit? Two blasts, two days. And we got you in both places... The third force of nature is the strong nuclear force. You've been lying to us for two hours. Destroy a single atom and you get Hiroshima. - Just shut up. - Hey, look at me! And you better start telling the truth. For Christ's sake I'm telling you the truth. What's that Nico Sola got to do with that research facility uptown? It looked like a war zone. - Who are you working for? - Tell them you're working for a higher power. - I'm working for a higher power. - What are you, a terrorist? - No! - People died, - you son of a bitch! - Now that's established, let them know you've left a rather advanced explosive device at the Four River Shipyard. - ...Jihad shit, huh? - He's got a bomb. - Who's... who's got a bomb? - Jesus. - Who's got a bomb? - There is a bomb at the shipyard. - All right, go - Go! - Bobby, get it out! - Go! - Go! - Alright, listen. Good. Now this is how this works. If you find that bomb first, everybody lives. But if they find it before you I would estimate 20,000 dead. That's an awful lot of blood on your hands, Joe. - Shut up. - The clock's ticking. You can keep whining and making excuses or man up and do something about it. Talk to me! God... Motherf... Stop! Stop it! Stop! Send several more to... Collateral damage, Joe. Let it go. If you don't get there in time a lot more people are going to be dead. Here's a clue, Joe. The bomb is in a shipping crate. With the police in hot pursuit, we are now being told, just coming into us, the man's name is Joseph Steadman. Dad? What? Suspect headed southbound underneath the wharf bridge. Reportedly, a security guard who was thought to have been actually killed at the blast at Redlock last night... It's not possible. What the fuck! We've never seen anything like this. We see a very disturbing live shot here, the only word I can come up with is some sort of a light blast going on from the vehicle. Ollie, dinner's ready. ...individuals are reporting essentially the same thing. Some kind of... Prepare the final phase. ...seen here. Contrail of energies are slicing through the centers of towns and of homes... What the hell! Hey! Hey! Hey, Zoe, just stay back! - Michael! - What're you doing! Hey! Don't fucking touch her! Zoe! Michael! I want these streets closed down now! Let's go, come on clear out! Bravo seven seven six. Zero one, perimeter secure. Where's the bomb? Sierra one. Sierra one. Delta seven eight five, do you copy? Delta seven eight five, do you copy? - Look out! - Look out! Zoe, baby. Zoe, are you here? See what you can become when you strip away all your excuses to fail? I swear to God... God? Let's see if God can save your daughter. This ends now. I think he's tracing us. You don't control me anymore. That's it, Joe. Now you see where she is. Come on, then. Get here. We got to get out of here. Dad? - Dad? - Zoe! What's... what's going on? Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry. - What happened to you? - You're safe now. - I'm gonna take you home, okay? We gotta get out of here. - But I... No, no, no, we have to go. Let's get your sister. Sweetie, you have to trust me. Can you do that? Okay. Good. Deliver us. We are essentially staring down the barrel of a gun. You're surprisingly chipper for someone who thinks we're all gonna get wiped out by... What did you call it? A cosmic beam of concentrated energy? I know about your work. I know they turned their back on it. What if I told you I have a plan? A plan to finally see it come to life. Because I know for a fact that it's the only thing powerful enough to stop what's coming. The end. It's time. Shoot her. No! No, no, no, no, no. - It's okay. - Oh my God. No, you're alright. You're alright. Zoe, Zoe. Zoe, look at me. No, no, no. Look at me. Zoe, Zoe, look at me. You're gonna be okay. Look at me. You're okay. We're gonna go home, okay? - I'm so... I'm sorry... - Sweetie. - I'm sorry. - Sweetie, no. Don't be sorry. I'm sorry. I'm the one who left. I'm sorry, sweetie. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm the one who left but I'm here now. I'm here now, okay? Hey. Zoe, don't go. No. No. No. No. I know you can hear me, Joe. You can hear everything. See everything. I've given you omnipotence. Through you I've created a God. Deliver us. You just have to believe like I do. Believe you're the man that I see. I need you to be strong for our girls. And keep our family together when I'm gone. Please. Promise me. I promise. Rhea? One four three. One... four... three... Subtitles by explosiveskull
