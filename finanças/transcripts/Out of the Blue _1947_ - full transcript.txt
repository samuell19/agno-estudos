(gentle music) (dramatic music) (bright music) Good morning Rabelais. Good morning Rabelais. Good morning Rabelais. (dramatic music) He's burying a bone in Mrs. Earthleigh's zinnias. Who's burying a bone, dear? That bachelor's dog from 10B. I think it's going to be hotter than yesterday. They found another. Another what, dear? Body, wrapped in a blood stained blanket. The fourth inside of a month. It must be a fiend. Women are warned not to go out after dark until the Greenwich Village Murderer has been caught. Greenwich Village Murderer indeed. He's probably from Uptown. I, for one, shan't set foot out of this building. We've always been safe so far. There they are now. - Who dear? - The Earthleighs. You forgot the sugar again! Oh, yes dear. He forgot the sugar again. He's so forgetful. (bright music) That old maid on the 12th floor's watching us again. She's there every morning at 8:05 like clockwork. Don't look now Arthur! Oh, oatmeal, oh yes. It's Saturday. Oh, we're in for another scorcher, should be cooler in Connecticut. I do wish you were coming with me. Now Mae. Well I was only thinking of your comfort. Cecelia does have that breeze from the river. The river gets that breeze from Cecilia. (Arthur hooting) Arthur, you know I don't like jokes about my sister. My train leaves at 6:30. You'll be there on time? Of course, dear. Oh, I hate leaving you alone. If it weren't Cecelia's anniversary, but you must admit in the seven years we've been married, I haven't left you alone very often. Uh huh, that's right, dear. And I appreciate it. Arthur, can't you read your newspaper on the bus? I like to read it sitting down. Arthur! You're not going to smoke? But this is not in the house! All right, if you must be technical I'll bring you an ashtray. Arthur, look! My zinnias! It's that dog, that artist's dog! I knew, you see, a bone, he's buried a bone! Keep that for evidence. Oh my poor, poor little zinnias. Arthur, that dog has got to go. This time you must be firm. (moaning) What do you expect me to do about it? What any man would do to protect his own home. This calls for action. Of course, if you're afraid. No, of course I'm not afraid. Well, I'll talk to him, here take this. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) Why don't you answer it? Hello? Galleo? This is your neighbor, Arthur Earthleigh. My wife just unearthed a bone in her flower box. Tell her if no one calls for it in 30 days she can keep it. The bone happens to belong to your dog. Tell your wife she can keep the bone, I'll get my dog another. But she doesn't want the bone! Then why did she dig it up? Now see here Galleo, you've got to keep him off this terrace. No, no, he's got to get rid of him. You've got to get rid of him. Get rid of Rabelais! I'll get rid of you first! Indeed, sir. And just how do you propose to do that? There are ways, Mr. Earthleigh. You've got to get rid of that dog today. Now, give him away, sell him. (Mr. Galleo speaking faintly) Mr. Galleo, please, such language! My wife is right at my elbow! Well I'll bet she is and gnawing on Rabelais's bone no doubt. Now look here, Mr. Earthleigh, I don't mind your wife stealing my dog's bone but if you return that bone to me in first class condition, I'm willing to forget the whole thing. What's the matter? He wants the bone back. Arthur, really. Mention the renting agent. Galleo, if you don't do what we say, I'll notify the renting agent immediately. Oh, come on now, Earthleigh, after all we're neighbors, we both live on the 10th floor. Do me a favor will you, jump off! (dramatic music) (phone clicks) Well? He hung up. Well don't just stand there like a totem pole. Do something! I'll do something. What? Oh, well, I'll see my lawyer. Fine! And tell him about the parade of women that streams through that bachelor's apartment day and night. Oh, those are his models. Well, some of them must be. (gentle music) Oh hello, pardon me. - Have you a Mister...? - 10B, step in. - I'm looking for Mr. Galleo... - I know, 10B. Step in. But how did you know I wanted Mr. Galleo. Well because you've got the face and the figure for 10B. - I have? - Mm-hm. (doorbell buzzes) Come in. Hello Rabelais. Well it's about time you got here. Mr. Galleo, I'm Deborah Tyler, I tried to get you on the phone but you're not listed so I... That's all right, I'll be right with you. Just take off your clothes. I beg your pardon? Get undressed, as soon as I finish breakfast we'll go to work. Just a minute, please. Oh, I bet forgot to bring a bathing suit, hm. Well, there are couple in there. Mr. Galleo, I'm not a model. I came to see you about Rabelais. Rabelais, did he bury a bone in your zinnias too? What? Did Arthur Earthleigh send you? Who? That guy next door, he just phoned me about Rabelais. Has he made you an offer? I'll meet any terms he may have proposed. You can have your choice, a flat rate, pick of the litter or both. Say, uh, who are you anyway? Deborah Tyler, I own Zantippy. That so? What's Zantippy. My prize Shepherd. Oh. When your Rabelais took best of breed at the Philadelphia show, I'm from Philadelphia, I decided then my Zantippy must someday meet your Rabelais. That's why I'm here. Just a minute, Miss Tyler. Rabelais, leave the room. (upbeat music) You see there's a little wolf in Rabelais and I wouldn't want him to get the wrong impression. Oh, I see. Now what's your proposition? Anything you ask. Anything? Yes, I'll give anything to arrange this match. Sold. [Deborah] You haven't named a price. Well you see Rabelais really doesn't need any money. He leads a very happy life here in the village. He has all the bones he can possibly handle and I don't want puppies. Mr. Galleo, I came here on business. [Galleo] Art is my business, I would like you to pose for me. You're not serious? [Galleo] Why not? You pose for me, Zantippy gets Rabelais and they live happily ever after. But I don't know the... You have an interesting neck. Your hands are good. Of course, the face could be a little longer. It will be a little longer if you don't get serious. We'll try some quick sketches just as you are... No, no, better get into a bathing suit. Now, but, I have a fitting at 10:30 and shopping and a luncheon date. I thought you were so crazy to have Zantippy meet Rabelais. Oh I am, but... Well, then let's not waste time talking, I think I can find a bathing suit that will fit you. (gentle music) Some iced tea dear? Oh, relaxing always makes me so tired. It isn't the relaxing, I think the heat takes it out of us. He's got another. Another what, dear? Another girl. This one's prettier than that redhead he had Thursday. In broad daylight, where do they think they are? Parading around like that. Nobody's forcing you to look, dear. Doris will never believe this. [David] Doris? A friend I'm visiting, we were roommates at Bryn Mawr. Oh, I think half profile will be better for this, the light in your eyes is nicer from that angle. Sorry. I just felt like doing what comes naturally. Naturally. I really must be going. Why, you've missed your fitting your lunch date and your tea date. I can still make my cocktail date if I hurry. Oh, phone them and tell them to come over, I'll whip up some cocktails. Please let me go. Doris is waiting. (gentle music) Ah, I wonder what we ever saw in her, Rabelais? She has ice in her veins. (dramatic music) (Rabelais whining) (dramatic music) [Conductor] All aboard! - Stamford, Davenport. - Mae, oh, excuse me, Mae. - New Haven. - You're late. I know, I stopped to get you a going away present. Oh, chocolates, Arthur, you know what they do to my figure. I'll bet you forgot to see the lawyer. [Arthur] No I didn't, saw him first thing this morning. You did! What did he say? Well, we may be better off than we thought. He's having the renting agent write a letter to Galleo. And if he doesn't get rid of his dog, we can have him evicted. Oh, wonderful. I've always wanted that apartment for Cecelia. (Arthur moans) Well I'll take back that better off. I, uh, bought you a book so you'll have something to do while I'm away. Above Reproach? By Douglas Lord. [Mae] Mm, it's quite good. I read the first three chapters under the dryer. Yeah, well then I'll start with chapter four. My train comes in tomorrow night at 10:15 Arthur and try to be on time. Shall we synchronize our watches? Now, remember, don't rush around in this heat, don't spend over $2 for dinner, nothing fried in deep fat and no spaghetti. Well, goodbye, and have a good time. [Mae] Goodbye, you have a good time. Yeah, where? [Conductor] Providence and Boston, all aboard! (upbeat piano music) (people chattering) Good evening sir. Hi. I guess there's no room. Oh, we've got lot of room, just wait 10 minutes. You can enjoy yourself by the bar. I don't drink. Well, you can eat some peanuts. Check the gentleman hat. Uh, this way please. (people chattering) Yes sir. [Arthur] Oh, no thanks, I'm just waiting for a table, on the wagon. Those are habit forming too. Above Reproach. I don't believe it. Sounds ghastly. Well, I haven't read it yet. Did I hear you say you were on the wagon? So am I. Technically. This is a health drink, made with lemons and cucumbers and juniper berries. Full of vitamins. Couple of these before every meal and you'll never have scurvy. Couple of those and you'll never have the meal. Danny, we want more vitamins. No, no, no. Not for me, just ginger ale. Ginger ale, oh that's very bad for you. Do you know what happens to people who drink ginger ale? Tsk, tsk, tsk. Fix him one of these, Danny. No, really, I... Do you want to have scurvy? Ew, no! You see, I've got to be very careful, bad heart. I'm liable to pop off right in the middle of a conversation. That's too bad, I'm awfully sorry. Well, here's to us. Good? Well it's like, like uh... It's like drinking a spring twilight. Say, that's very poetic. I used to write poetry when I first came to the village. Didn't pay. Then I drifted into interiors. You know my shop, Olive and Patricia Interiors? I'm Olive. If you ever need any chintzes, think of me. Well, it wouldn't take a chintz to make a man think of you (laughs). Shall we switch to martinis? Would they mix with this? They better or I'll complain to the management. Your table is ready sir. - Oh. - Oh no, let me. I invited you. Oh no, I wouldn't think of it. I insist. Well, all right. Charge it, Danny. Now, you must have dinner with me. I'll pay for dinner. Thanks. (gentle music) He's at it again. In all this heat? Nothing bothers him. Well, aren't you glad you stayed? Where else in New York could you dine so comfortably? Just how long will it take to finish this painting of me? Ah, who knows, Da Vinci took 20 years to paint the Mona Lisa. (gentle music) (dramatic music) You're right. It's absolutely wrong. (gentle music) [Waiter] Thank you sir. To us Duke. Know what they charge for that brandy? 90 cents a shot! Why I have a fifth of really fine brandy at my apartment and it only cost $6.60. Imagine the profits they make here, why there must be 100 shots of brandy in a bottle, at 90 cents a shot! Why that's $900 a bottle. Either their profit is enormous or my arithmetic is lousy. Did you say you had some brandy at your apartment? Olive, you have a fine memory. Would you, I mean, I'm just around the corner at 35 East? Would you, uh. You talked me into it, let's go. Well, I think it would be better if you follow me, I mean, our going in together might start the elevator boy talking. You make it sound very intriugish. 35 East. Apartment 10A. Oh, and uh, here's $1 for the cab. You better call a taxi. - Taxi! - Oh, not in here. Outside. Oh. Eh, well, au revoir. (jazzy music) Keep the change my good man. (upbeat music) (bright music) Nice poochy, nice poochy. My good woman, that dog is not a pooch. And I am not your good woman, so that makes us even. (dramatic music) 10? Yes, please. Greenwich Village Fiend still at large. Story on page nine. Would you like me to turn to page nine? Yes, please. A girl just isn't safe on the streets anymore is she? You're so right. Who knows where the fiend may strike next. On a deserted sidewalk, under a shadowy tree, or even in a crowded elevator. (bright music) Are you following me? I'm sorry to disappoint you madam, but I'm not the Greenwich Village Murderer. Well, you slay me. Touche. Sashay. (upbeat music) (doorbell buzzes) - That you Olive? - Hiya, Cookie! (bright music) Whoo! Are you that glad to see me? Well, it's a little late, Olive, and I was afraid... That I wasn't coming. - Uh huh. - Don't be silly Arthur. Oh, uh, how did you know. You forgot your book. Oh. Your name is in it. Arthur. Arthur of the Round Table. My knight in shining spectacles. So this is where you live. Your wife decorated? Yes. I like it. It's in such exquisite bad taste. I could have fun with this room. I don't want to have fun with the room I'd like to have a little fun in it. (laughs) What is it? Ew, put that down, Mae likes to find things just as she left them. Mae may not find anything the way she left it. I was enticed to this place with the promise of some very good brandy. Here it is. You know, brandy is very good for my heart. My doctor says it's a vascular dilator and my heart is liable to stop like that if I don't have brandy periodically. You don't think you've had too much? Oh, not too much. Or I couldn't say, periodically. (Arthur laughing) I like it here, with a few changes you could live in it. (upbeat music) (groans) What are you doing! Oh, it's a lovely piano Arthur. Why hide it. Did you buy it on time? (piano clanging loudly) Olive, it's after 10:30. No music. Oh stop acting like a babysitter. Oh, keep it there, my wife's pineapples. Relax Arthur and have some fun, you'll live longer. (bright music) Sit down Arthur and be comfortable. You know something? I'm beginning to like you a lot, you're cute. Well I like you too, Olive. And I like you too, Arthur. You know, if I really let myself go, I could fall in love with you. But I'll bet you're used to having women tell you that, aren't you? Well it's been some time. Has it? (upbeat music) Now we're alone. Could I get you some coffee? Caffeine is very bad for my heart. Well, I think I'd better make some for myself. Don't run away Arthur. Come over here closer. You're beginning to blur. Er, Olive. Yes, Arthur? Let's call it an evening shall we? Okay, it's an evening. No, no, I mean, I think I'd better take you home. That's taking a lot for granted. But why? How do you know I've got a home? Well, I... You're the cutest thing. Olive, I'm going to take you home. Say, are you trying to give me the brush off? Not exactly. If you want me to go, just say so. I can take a hint. (Arthur moans) A house doesn't have to fall on my head. I'll take you. Oh no, you won't. It's got to be a clean break. No long drawn out farewells. Oh, isn't that just like a man. To send me out into the night without my shoes. I thought you were the one friend I could call my friend, but you're just like all the rest. I'll get a taxi. Don't bother about me, I'll be all right. Get me a taxi, take me home. Gallantry, gallantry. Gallantry is dead. Cold stone dead. I hate men, all men. Cruel, heartless, hideous. Promising this and promising that. Then welshing this and welshing that. (bright music) (door slams) Hello? (bright music) (door thuds) (dramatic music) (doorbell buzzing) [Arthur] Oh, I'm coming. I'm coming. (door buzzing) ♪ La, la, la ♪ ♪ La, la ♪ ♪ Oo, oo ♪ ♪ Buh buh ba ♪ [Arthur] Who's that? - Come in. - Who is it? [Olive] It's me. [Elevator Boy] Special delivery. [Arthur] Open the door! I can't, it's locked. Not you, I'm talking to you. I'm not dressed yet! Is the lock stuck, should I call the janitor? No, I'll open it. [Olive] You don't have to, I'll be out in a minute. Good morning, special. [Arthur] Oh, thank you. I signed for it. [Arthur] Well give it to me and hurry up. Here I come. But my head is bending low. What are you doing here? Dressing. Zip me please. (gasps) That, why, that belongs to Mae, it's her favorite housecoat. Mine too. My dress is a sight. You shouldn't have let me sleep in my clothes, Arthur. Zip me. Oh, I'd thought you'd gone home, why didn't you? And leave you all by yourself to face the morning after alone? What have you done to the guest room? Why you've changed everything. Where are all the doodads? I mean the things that were on the things? You mean all those antimacassars and doilies? Oh, I stashed them away in one of the bureau drawers. Oh, I hope I can remember where everything was. Grouchy this morning, aren't ya? You need some breakfast. [Arthur] I'm not hungry! What a lovely, lovely morning. Let's go for a drive in the country, you do have a car don't you? Yes, I do, Olive. You want me to take you home? You should go home you know. Should I? If I didn't distinctly remember your asking me up here, I'd think I wasn't welcome. Don't you like me anymore, Duke? Oh yes. But it's Sunday. So it is. So it is. But it's a lovely Sunday. Let's have breakfast on the terrace. No, no, no. You mustn't. Why not? I'll bet it's a lovely view. You can't go out there. What do you mean, pushing me around? You can't push me around like an old beach umbrella. Look, if I give you breakfast will you go home? Fine, just some Melba toast and brandy. Don't go to any trouble. I'm going to have some black coffee and you're going to have some too. Oh no, you don't. Just because you're a caffeine addict, don't think you can drag me down with you. Ew, Olive, please stay sober. Doctor's orders, Duke. Hm. You forgot your special delivery. Hm. From Mae? No, my lawyer. What did you do? It's about a dog. A neighbor's dog. I'll start the coffee. Copy of letter to Mr. David Galleo. Dear Mr. Galleo, acting on the complaint of your neighbors, you must either dispose of your dog within 24 hours, Or vacate the premises immediately. (doorbell buzzing) Good morning. Come in, Deborah. This is Sunday, and you are Mr. Galleo, the impulsive young artist just panting to paint me? 24 hours, dispose of my dog. Why, I'll tear them limb from limb and let Rabelais bury their bones. Remember me? The name's Tyler, Deborah Tyler. We met yesterday, you asked me to pose. Oh, what are you bringing that back for, don't you know it's your death warrant? Here, read this, that's what's the matter with me! They can't do this. Or can they? You know what I'm going to do, I'm going next door and crack that guys' skull. I wouldn't do that. Why not, let them send me to jail. That wouldn't solve the problem. What do you want me to do? Gather up my dog, put my tail between my legs and sneak out? David, you've got to be sensible about this. Sensible? You mean let them walk all over me. Let them tell me how to live and where. (Rabelais barking) Go ahead, let off steam. But I think my way's better. [David] And what is your way? Well it's the dog they object to, right? Why not give Rabelais a little vacation in the country. While he's gone, we'll find a place that likes dogs. [David] What do you mean, a little vacation in the country? I know just the place, in Westchester. Zantippy was there for her first litter, it's very nice. A kennels! I won't do it. I won't put Rabelais into a kennels. - Thatta boy. - Come on boy. Give him Zantippy's quarters, those were nice. Goodbye Rabelais. You want anything, just bark. He'll be all right, really. And you'll have him back very soon. I'm going to be lost without him. I know. I've always had a dog myself. Debby, will you stick with me for the rest of the day? You mean, try to take your dog's place? I'm afraid you could never take his place. Well thanks for the trade last. Why Rabelais' almost human. So am I. Now seriously speaking, you don't know how much I think of that dog. Yes, I do. I'll stick with you. Good. (gentle music) ♪ You'll know where or when ♪ Olive we've got to go!

Oh, and what do I have to do? Get into striped pants and cutaway and wait for you at the alter while you drift down the aisle in orange blossoms and lace? Just for a kiss? Not at all. Just a simple country wedding would suit me fine. Debby, I value your intelligence to highly to insult you with any rational thoughts of marriage. (Deborah laughing) Are men still saying that to girls. And what makes you so wise, that college degree? Did they give courses in the technique of love? Yes, David, and I majored in resistance. (David laughs softly) (upbeat music) (doorbell buzzing) I'll bet you thought it was a special delivery. Surprise. On account of I drank all of yours up and I thought maybe your wife would ask questions. Look Olive, I've got to meet the train. I was just leaving to go to the station. Maybe you'd better keep the brandy. But we didn't have our farewell toast. Olive, please, the train! You didn't have to sneak out on me. Well I was nervous, I wanted to check up to see that everything was in order. Well, why didn't you say so. I'd have been glad to come back and help you. Well it's all finished now, shall we leave? Just one last one for farewell, Arthur. It'll only take a minute. But I washed all the glasses. (tongue clicking) No drink, no go. Olive, my wife's train is traveling in this direction at 90 miles an hour. I don't care if your wife's train runs right through this room, do I get my drink? (groans) Okay. If you leave as soon as you've had it. You know what I'd like to drink to, Arthur? I'd like to drink to Mrs. Average Housewife. The backbone of our nation. Is your wife the backbone of our nation? You leave Mae's backbone out of this. All right, then let's drink to... Eh, just drink, no conversation. All right, Arthur. Now, we're signing off. Hospitality is dead. Cold stone dead. ♪ Cut yourself a piece of moonlight ♪ ♪ Out of the blue ♪ ? Out of the blue? Olive, stop that! Arthur, I just realized something. I love you. You can't!

If you want me to I'll stay right here and explain the whole thing to Mae. Don't even joke about such a thing. You are joking aren't you? You men are all alike. Only thinking of yourselves. You take the best years of a girl's life. I haven't known you for years. Certainly not the best years. The principle remains the same. I'm not getting any younger, Arthur. That's completely irrelevant, a non sequitur. You watch your language, Mr. Earthleigh. Just because you picked me up in a public bar doesn't mean I'm not a woman with a woman's feelings. Oh Olive, will you listen to reason, we've got to get out of here. You pushed me. All right, I pushed you, I apologize, but get up, we've got to go! I wouldn't go anywhere with you. I wouldn't be seen walking in public... I'm going to count three and if you don't get out of here I'm, one. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, threatening me, you fiend. And me with a weak heart.

Extra, extra! Viola, the night air, my sinuses. Excuse me. [Newspaper Boy] Another body found! Hey, extra! Read all about it. Read all about The Greenwich Village Murderer. Extra! (dramatic music) Oh! Oh. Florence! Please dear, I'm concentrating. There's been a murder! Will you ever remember to shut the door? I saw the body, I saw it. Achoo! Oh dear, if I catch cold I'll never forgive you. Body? What body? Send for the police. Get me Mr. Galleo's apartment. (phone ringing) (gentle music) David. Phone's ringing. It does that quite often. Pay no attention. Better answer it. (David sighs) Hello. Excuse me for disturbing you, but I thought you'd like to know. There's a body on your terrace. A dead body. Oh, thank you very much. Just leave it there. (gentle music) (dramatic music) What's the matter? Oh! Is she dead? I don't think so. How did she get here? (Olive moaning) Get some smelling salts in the medicine chest. Ah, feeling any better? How did I get here? You tell me. Oh, I know you, you're the man with the dog. I used to be. There were no smelling salts so I brought brandy. I'll forgive you. Say do you know a man about so low by the name of Earthleigh? Sure, he's my neighbor. He struck me. He struck you? No! He knocked me cold or else I fainted. You see, I have a bad heart. And when I pass out I really pass out. People tell me I look positively dead. Then Earthleigh must have thought he killed you. So he dumps you on my terrace. Why that's terrible I never heard of such a thing. How do you like that. You can't even bury a bone on his terrace, but he can throw his old dead bodies on mine. Who's an old dead body! Well he thought you were. Oh, isn't he a heel though, that Earthleigh. Why I might really have been dead. We ought to report him to the police. Oh, no, don't do that. The scandal would ruin me socially. (sirens wailing) I'm afraid it's too late. Sounds like somebody's already called the police. Wait a minute, girls. This may be my chance to get back Rabelais. You'll have to help me Deborah, and you too. Anything you say, handsome. It's right in line with my good neighbor policy. Now listen. - This the place? - 10-4. We don't need the assistance of the junior crime club. Yes, but I'm the one who found the body. And I'm the accomplice. You're what? I mean, we live together, just above the crime. Okay you two. The rest of you go on home and listen to your radios. You'll hear about it faster that way. (upbeat music) (doorbell buzzing) [David] Come in. We're from homicide and we'll have to take a look at your terrace. [Officer] I'll take it. [David] Oh, was one of you ladies the one who thought she saw a body on my terrace? I saw it. I'm afraid the lady's mistaken. No, I'm not. I definitely saw a body. Is this the body? (bright music) Well, is it? [Officer] Come on, was it? Well it looked more dead. Hysteria no doubt. No, I tell you, I saw a woman's body lying prone on that terrace. I always lie prone after posing, it relaxes me. Oh, I'm sorry if I disturbed you. [David] Well, we're sorry we've disappointed you. We'll try to do better the next time. I'd have a sworn it. If I hadn't seen her alive, I'd have sworn she was dead. Come dear. [Viola] Nobody's got better eyesight than I have. She was lying flat on her back. (upbeat music) (both laughing) Success. (woman screaming) Oh, there's a body in there! A body? (Olive screaming) (David laughing) Girls, I want you to meet my first wife. I keep her here purely for sentimental reasons. How do you do? You ought to feed her better, she looks anemic. My first model when I couldn't afford a live one, given to me by an artist who could. Pillar to post, poor thing I know just how she feels. This whole thing has unnerved me terribly. I'm just a bundle of nerves. You don't mind if I take a little of your stimulant do you? Another minute in that closet and I'd have had an attack. I'll just have to start taking better care of myself. [David] You know Olive, I'm very glad you unearthed this dummy. They are about the same size. She's skinnier. She's our corpus delicti, she's been in that closet too long. It's about time she had a decent burial. Cecelia's coming in tomorrow to look at that man's apartment. I hope he is stubborn about that dog so we can have him evicted. Good evening. To bad you folks didn't get here sooner. You missed all the excitement. (suitcase thuds) Ow! Arthur, be more careful. What excitement? The police just left. The old maids on 12 found a body. The old maids? How'd it get there? If those old maids found a body, they wouldn't report it to the police. It was on the terrace next to yours. Galleo's. One of his models, I understand. You mean, she was murdered? Well it was... Er, wait a minute son, we don't care to hear anymore, this is none of our affair. - Yeah but... - But never mind. Okay. (bright music) As soon as I hang up my good things, I'm gonna call those two old maids and find out what really happened. Oh, no, no Mae, let's keep our nose out of this. Why it might be a nasty scandal. [Mae] Arthur, what are you so nervous about? Hm? You've been nervous ever since you met me five minutes late. Something wrong? Oh no, everything is lovely, it's uh, well it's just that I'm so happy to have you home. Oh how sweet. Did you have an awful time without me. Yes Mae, you have no idea. I think I'll get a little fresh air. (bright music) (tense music) Psst, Earthleigh. Good evening neighbor, uh, come here. I would like to have a word with you. If it's about your dog it's out of my hands. It isn't about my dog. It's about the dead body. The dead body? Yes, I found a body on my terrace about an hour ago. - An hour ago? - It was still warm. - You don't say? - Mm hm. How did she get there? Oh, you're brilliant Earthleigh. How did you guess it was a she? Oh, well, so many of them lately are. Exactly, and I might be suspected of all those murders. What do you suppose I ought to do about it? [Mae] Arthur? For one thing, speak a little softer. Neighbor, I'm gonna ask you to help me, to show a little neighborliness. What do you mean? Well you see I'm an artist. A bohemian, everyone's ready to think the worst of me. But you, you're a respectable man, you're in business, no one would suspect anything of you. Just think of what a story it will make if I'd told him the truth. What a switch that would be. [Mae] Arthur, what's keeping you! I'm coming. Really Mr. Earthleigh was dumping that poor girl on my terrace your idea of a decent Christian burial? I didn't have time to think. I had to get rid of her. And you're more accustomed to handling women than I am. Not dead ones. [Mae] Arthur! Did you call the police? They were here but I got rid of them. Uh, they don't suspect yet. What do you want me to do? Not much, just help me get rid of the body. I'll do anything you say. All right, I'll call you at midnight. Be prepared. Prepared? Yes, old clothes, there'll be digging to do. Oh, uh, and one more thing. Take care of this, my eviction notice. This is blackmail, Mr. Galleo. You're so right, Mr. Earthleigh. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) Yes. Yes, of course. Yeah, I understand, right away. Who was that Arthur? [Arthur] That was the boss. The big boss. Wants me to drive him to the airport. [Mae] At this time of night? [Arthur] Well, planes leave at all hours, Mae. (jazzy music) Oh no, Olive, that's going too far. I think she should have candles. - No, Olive. - Yes. Whose body is this anyway? Oh yours, you zombie. But I don't want it too well lit. That was my trouble when I was alive. Always too well lit. She does look like me though. Makes me feel kind of sad. Poor Olive. You were a good girl. No one can say you were ever anything but kind and good. Whose fault was it that you ended up like this? Men, that's whose fault it was. Men. (sobbing dramatically) Arthur, you're not going to wear that outfit to the airport. Why not? What would your boss think? You look like a tramp. Well maybe he'll take pity and offer me a raise. You talk to him tonight about that vice president's job. Tonight's the perfect time to get in some spade work. (dramatic music) Olive you shouldn't be here. Don't you think you ought to go home? In this? There are some dresses in the models' closet, grab one of those and beat it. I want to go along and see the fun. Maybe you can show us how that can be arranged. Whose funeral is this anyway? Go home, Olive. (door knocking) Oh, there's Earthleigh now. Into the closet, Olive. Into the closet, Olive. Out of my apartment, Olive. Go home, Olive. Pillar to post, post to pillar, where will it all end? Sh, quiet, Olive! I'll take this along for company. You do love company, don't you. Ah, what a well dressed gravedigger will wear. Please, I'm in no mood for joking. Well, there she is. You wouldn't want to have a last look would you. No, thanks. I didn't think so. As a matter of fact, I was counting on it. Well, what are you standing around moping for? Get a move on. Do you want your rod? Quit talkin' so much and do as you're told, of course I want my rod. Loaded? Sure, what do you think? Dope! Is that young lady to be trusted? Better be (imitates throat slicing) I know the most perfect spot down in Westchester where we can bury the body. - Westchester? - Mm-hm. Here's your rod. Oh, what's that thing for! Oh, better safe than sorry. Say you'd better have a drink old man, steady your nerves. There's a bottle over there. Are you still here, I thought I told you to get that freight elevator. I don't think I know how to work it. Okay half wit, I'll go with you. You stay here. (dramatic music) (Arthur coughs) (tense music) (Olive laughing) (door thuds) (Arthur screams) Galleo! Oh, is that you Galleo? The strangest thing just happened. What's the matter? [Arthur] Oh I feel faint now. Well you'd better have another drink. But the bottle's gone, it disappeared when my back was turned. [David] Ah, you're imagining things. No, no the bottle was there and then... Ah, you see it's still there. (Arthur moaning) Uh oh, too late. Oh come on, no time to waste. Give me a hand. Here we go, ups-a-daisy. (dramatic music) Oh, it's a sad world. Sic transit gloria... what was her name? Olive. Well, goodbye Olive. Goodbye boys. (dramatic music) Did you hear that voice? What voice? Earthleigh, you've got to steal yourself, you've got a tough night ahead. (dramatic music) Did anyone see you? Ah, don't talk so much. I don't know why I didn't just turn you in, instead of helping you out like this. I guess I'm just a sucker for a guy in a jam. Had some pretty close shaves myself. Never murder though, I draw the line there. Olive Jensen's death was a regrettable accident, nothing more and you know it. Oh, red hair. Evidence like this could send you straight to the hot seat. Oh, oh, uh, maybe we'd better put it in the trunk. No, just blow it away. Oh, well you blow it. Oh, you blow it. (Arthur blowing) (dramatic music) Case the street. Gotcha. Everything is jake. [David] Let's go. (man whistling) It's a cop. Cop? Do you want to get us all hanged? You want to get us all hanged? [David] Let's go. (box thudding) Sh! Butterfingers! [Arthur] Sh! (dramatic music) Well, well, if it isn't my friend Mr. Earthleigh. May I help you? Oh no, thanks. No trouble at all. Oh, thank you very much. That's all right, good night. [Arthur] Good night. (dramatic music) (sirens wailing) (Arthur moaning) [David] Earthleigh, pull yourself together. Come on. (Arthur moaning) (dramatic music) (siren wailing) I thought you said this car could do 90. No, no! Come on step on it, we can lose him. 90! (dramatic music) 95! No! - 100! - Oh, could you. Step on it. (dramatic music) (siren wailing) Driver's license. Where do you think you're going to, a fire? No, to a funeral. Very funny. What have you got in the trunk? A dead body. Oh wise guy eh? Judge will take care of you. No respect for the dead. [Arthur] Hey please, be quiet. Take it easy from here on, bud. Keep it down. Take care of that big shot, you got influence. (Arthur moans) (dramatic music) You're not taking Olive to a dog kennel? Not Olive she was a nice girl. I'm picking up Rabelais. (horn tooting) I called them to get him ready. Your dog? At this hour? An alibi my good man, in case anyone wonders what you were doing in the woods at this hour. And stick to it pal, even if they drive spikes under your fingernails. Remember, we're in this thing together, no squealers. - Hey you Rabelais. - Hi, Rabelais. [David] Come here, boy. Come on, get in the back. Get under there boy. (Arthur groaning) - Thank you, I appreciate it. - Good night. (dramatic music) Get out. (tense music) Bring the spade. Gotcha. (dramatic music) You go wait in the car. If you see anything, signal. I'll stand guard here. Gotcha. Two by 2 1/2 by 3 1/2 oughtta do, start digging. (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (rain drumming) Uh huh, that's just right. Ah, you take that end there. Well, one, two. Wait a minute. Wouldn't you like to say a few words, something short and to the point, but reverent. Well. She was a good girl. She had a good heart. A weak one, but a good one. That's right. No one could say anything but that she was good and kind. That's right, good and kind. Thank you Arthur, that's exactly what Olive would want you to say. Here we go. (men groaning) Wouldn't you like to do the honors? I think you should throw in the first spade. - Oh no, no, thanks. - Oh, go ahead. Go ahead, yeah. Olive Jensen, how long she been missing? - Four days. - Mm-hm. Four days. Ever stay out before? Never more than three days. Mm-hm. Suspicious circumstances. Description? Well I though this might help. It's several years old, but it's still very much like her. (men whistling) I'd sure hate to think the Greenwich Village Murderer mutilated that. I wouldn't worry too much, lady. A dame like that could be missing five days under the most pleasant circumstances. But you will try and find her. Will we? Well, here is my address and phone number. What's her address and phone number? The same. Oh I hope nothing's happened to Olive. I hope she's alive. So do we lady, so do we. (gentle music) (doorbell buzzing) Good morning, Deborah. Are you still here? I seem to be. Won't you come in? (gentle music) Where's David? Asleep. Asleep? Oh, we were up until all hours. He told me all about the funeral, I nearly died. Quite cozy aren't we? Won't you sit down. How 'bout a cup of coffee? I have some on the stove. No thank you, I had my breakfast hours ago. Cigarette? No, thanks. You know, I wish I'd been at my funeral. I wish you had too. Must have been a scream. Davy told me all about it. I never laughed so much in my life. You should have come back with him. I bet you missed me terribly. [Olive] You're not going? Davy wants you to pose, doesn't he? Why don't you do it? You have nice eyes, your legs are good, and that henna in your hair could be toned down. [Olive] If I didn't know you so well, I'd say that was a dirty crack. You don't know me at all, and it is! [Olive] What'll I tell David? Tell him Zantippy has changed her mind about Rabelais. She prefers someone more discriminating. (Rabelais whining) Oh no, please, not again. [Mae] You're not a child, you're a grown man. (Arthur groans) Honestly when I think of you out in the rain at midnight, changing your boss's tire, wallowing in mud up to your elbows, catching your death of cold It's not my fault if we got a flat tire. [Mae] I didn't say it was. You're always making issues, Arthur. Well I feel better now, I think I'll go to the office. [Mae] You'll do no such thing. If it hadn't been for your boss you wouldn't have this cold. I have a notion to call and give him a good piece of my mind. Oh, no, no, Mae, don't do that. [Mae] I'm going to get you some hot lemonade, you need something to make you sweat. Sweat? I've done enough of that already. (bright music) (dramatic music) (Olive screams) (Arthur yells) - Arthur? - Yes! Why Arthur, you look as if you've seen a ghost. A ghost, oh. Where are you going? I want to see my lawyer. - Like that? - Oh. Arthur I refuse to let you leave this house with that cold. Well then, I'll have to leave without it. I gotta see my lawyer. (Mae sighs) Hey, corpus delicti, come here, I've got something for you. Hiya, cookie! Deborah not here yet? My new dress. Hasn't she phoned? Oh David, it's beautiful. You shouldn't have been so extravagant. Oh, well shrouds come high this year. Say, come on and eat, I want you out of here when Deborah arrives. I could kiss you for this. Mm, I hope she's not going to be late. I want to try something new, something entirely different. I wouldn't waste time planning it if I were you. Deborah's not coming back. Back, was she here? Oh, hours ago. She's probably half way to Philadelphia by now. Well why didn't she wait? I don't think Deborah likes you anymore. She said to tell you Zantippy doesn't care for Rabelais either. - Oh, fine. - Oh, come on and have some coffee and forget Philadelphia, David. Go home Olive, you should have gone home last night. I didn't have anything to wear. Well you have now. Oh, I should have carried you home when I found you passed out, instead of letting you sleep it off here. You're just like all the rest. You take the best years of a girl's life... Olive, go home! If I find you here when I come back, I'll throttle you. Come on Rabelais we've got to square things with Deborah. I'll go. I can take a hint (crying softly). (dramatic music) What's that dog left on your terrace now, Earthleigh? I wish it were only a question of a dog. This is murder. Don't tell me you took the law and dog in your own hands and killed it. Well unfortunately it isn't that simple. Look, here read that. Have you seen this girl? Police are seeking the whereabouts of Olive Jensen, missing five days. It is feared she may be the victim of Greenwich Village Murderer. Earthleigh, have you murdered this woman? I won't talk until I see my lawyer. Well, who do you think I am? - You, oh you, of course! - All right. Now, when did this happen? Well it was done last night. What time precisely? My wife's train got in at 10:15. And I had to get rid of her. Well isn't murder going a little far to get rid of your wife? No, not my wife, this Olive person. If she was found in my apartment, my wife would have killed me. Don't you or your wife know any simpler way of getting rid of people? I mean figuratively. Figuratively, this is beyond anything figurative. Murder is a fact, a fact you can't recall. And without looking in any book in my office, I can tell you it's a crime to kill anybody in New York State. Well I'm not entirely ignorant of the law. Well, how long was her, the body, cold. Ever since I met her. [Lawyer] No, no, I don't mean cold socially, I mean cold physically. Oh, about 18 hours. And you failed to notify the police? Well I thought about it, but I didn't know what to tell them. I didn't want to get involved in this thing. Where'd you hide the body? I folded it in half, neatly, and put it in an old trunk. Are you serious? And last night, in Westchester, I buried the trunk behind The Man's Best Friend Kennels. Murder, concealment, attempt to evade the processes of law. Earthleigh, are you in your right mind? Don't get personal! I have to get personal! Do you think it's going to help my reputation if you go to the electric chair for this? Well then sue my estate for damages. Ordinarily I don't take criminal cases. Ordinarily I don't commit crimes. So if you'll make an exception for me, I'll make one for you. All right. Now when was the last time you saw her alive. About an hour ago. Well, her or her ghost. But you buried her in a trunk in Westchester last night! But I saw her in my apartment an hour ago. Even Houdini couldn't get out of a trunk buried in Westchester that quick. Well you don't know Olive. What shall I do? Do? You've done enough already. Now wait a minute, let me think. Listen. If you will follow my instructions implicitly, you'll have nothing to worry about. - Really? - Absolutely. I will take the entire responsibility and you can forget the whole thing. Oh, well this is wonderful. Now first, you must tell me everything. Deny it to everyone else. You never knew the woman, you don't know anything about a body, you've never seen a trunk. And if anyone questions you, you are to be shocked, hurt and indignant. - Well, it's about time. - Not interested. Oh Deborah, quit being so Philadelphia, I've been waiting for you all day long, I've done 20 crossword puzzles. Congratulations. I never asked her to stay all night. I just couldn't get rid of her. You can't blame me for being angry when I find a woman making herself at home in your apartment. I was just as angry, I practically threw her out. Deborah, she's not my type. Don't you believe me? Oh, this is beginning to sound like a domestic quarrel. Well, I wish it were. (laughs) I wish it were. Deborah, my tailor's just around the corner. I could own striped pants and cut away this evening. How about it? (Rabelais barking) Did you hear that Rabelais, your boss is proposing marriage. Let's make it a double wedding, Zantippy and Rabelais and you and me. Well, could I let you know at dinner? I'll stop by for you at 7:30. No, I'll stop by for you. Not that I don't trust you, but I'll stop by for you. (gentle music) Come on Rabelais. (bright music) (tense music) (David groaning) Ah, you're not going to wake up here. (dramatic music) (gentle music) I'm supposed to be playing this, dear. Excuse me. [Florence] If this comes out, I shall have made the greatest scientific contribution to the game of Patience since, since Canfield. Oh! Oh! What's wrong now, dear? Seeing things again? Oh! (phone ringing) Hello? Mrs. Earthleigh? There's a body on your terrace. Sorry, I don't believe I heard you correctly. There's a body on your terrace. On my terrace, that's impossible! (dramatic music) (doorbell buzzing) Can we help you? We thought we'd see you before we called the police. I can't imagine how she got there. Where am I? Hi, girls. - Oh, poor thing. - Poor dear. You're not dead. - No. - We thought you were. Help me get her to the couch. In the cupboard there's some brandy, bring it to me. Just lie down here, lie down here quietly. You've had an awful shock, haven't you poor dear. Do you think you could have a sip of brandy? I'll try. Don't mind the taste, just think of the good it will do you. There, feel better? Maybe just a little more brandy? - Oh. - Oh, do you think she should? Oh, it's a stimulant. Now don't try to talk, just tell us what happened? He tried to kill me. - Mr. Galleo? - The artist? - That bohemian? - That monster. Did he strike you? Oh please don't make me talk about it. Maybe she needs a little more stimulant. Just give me the bottle. You want us to call the police? Oh no, think of my family, my reputation. Oh are you a debutante, dear? Yes, I came out in '38 and I haven't been home since. Were you posing for that fiend? He begged me to pose for him, he told me he'd make me immortal. No punishment is bad enough for a man like that. I hope they string him up. Some ice water, my dear. Oh my, she's fainted again! Now, now what? Oh, I don't know, I wish my husband were here. He'd know what to do. (upbeat music) (dramatic music) Good evening Mae, I've got a surprise for you. (dramatic music) (gasps) Arthur! What's wrong! Maybe he's allergic to flowers. Is that what she meant when she said he'd know what to do? - Oh Arthur. - Oh, what happened? You fainted. I told you not to go out in your condition. How'd she get here? That Galleo tried to murder her then left her for dead on our terrace. Is that what she told you? I mean, she's not dead is she? Oh no, no, just unconscious. We gave her some brandy and I don't think the poor dear's used to it. I wish Galleo and his dog would stop dropping things on our terrace. [Viola] Shouldn't we call the police? Police, for heaven's sake no. Well why not? Oh, well, I don't want them to find her here. But why not? Well, they might want to question her. Our consciences are clear. Yeah, but think of the notoriety. After all, I'm a business man, a respected member of society. And a mother with a daughter of the American Revolution. This calls for action. What are you gonna do with her? Where are you going Arthur? - To Galleo's. - Oh no! He's a dangerous man, a murderer, he might kill you both. I'm not afraid. [Viola] My isn't he brave. Yes, but I think we'd better call the police. We might really need them now. [Viola] Oh, uh, let me, where is the telephone? In the bedroom. What have you got there? The body we buried last night, it's come back. But it's going to haunt you, not me. [Arthur] Oh, oh, what's that? Olive's twin sister, it's a dummy. That's what we buried in Westchester, pal. Why you double crossing... Uh uh, wait a minute, just a minute. Remember, you started all this. From now on keep your unconscious bodies off my terrace. I've got more to do than clean up after you. Well, why did you dig her up? Your lawyer dug her up and he kept the trunk for evidence. - Evidence? - Mm-hm. This wire came with the body. It seems you're about to sue me Earthleigh for blackmail, defamation of character, fraud, intimidation and trespassing. I ought to punch you in the nose. I ought to punch you. Leaving Olive on my terrace for my wife to find. Go ahead! You owe me a punch, I owe you one, let's considered blows exchanged. You have a black eye, I have a bloody nose. Honor has been satisfied. And Olive has a place to sleep it off. Oh no you don't, I'm expecting Deborah, I've had enough trouble on account of Olive, get her out of here. Where am I gonna take her? Back to my wife? She'll call the police. Can't you control that wife of yours? Oh, I don't know. - I've never tried. - I wish she was my wife. You know what I'd do? No, but I wish she was your wife. Well, that's your problem, but don't try leaving Olive here, because the next time I'll take her right back to Mae with a full explanation. Now beat it. And take her with you, I've got to finish dressing. (bright suspenseful music) What happened? What happened next door? Don't you worry about what happened next door. That Galleo isn't gonna bother us anymore. I told him what I was gonna do if he dumped any more of his old dead girlfriends over here. - But we've called the police. - We? - I did. - Police! Why don't you two mind your own business. If you two want to know what's good for you, you're gonna learn to keep your nose out of your neighbors affairs. You can get into serious trouble poking around where you're not wanted. Now go home! And stay home! - Arthur, what are... - You get your hat and gloves! - What? - You heard, oh, I'm sorry dear, I was carried away. Get your hat and gloves dear, I was going to take you out to dinner. That's a lovely idea. What about the police? We called them because we thought you were in danger. Mae, didn't you think I could take care of myself? What kind of a husband do you think you've got? I am beginning to wonder. Well, go get fixed up and I'll take you out to a nice air cool place. (upbeat music) Hey, where have I seen you before lady? I remember, she was the body in 10B. The artist model. That's right. Can't be you they've murdered this time. They found another body? It's them old maids again, this time it's in 10A. If this one's a false alarm, we're gonna lock them two old biddies up! (dramatic music) - Oh, too late. - Now just a minute you two. We've got some questions to ask you. What about? Well it ain't information Please? Oh David, I'm... David, she's still here! Oh, it's just a dummy darling, remember? Back from the grave to haunt us. (Deborah laughing) Olive! Dummy! Deborah, so help me, Earthleigh left her. Oh fine. Deborah, you've got to believe me. Make it a good story David, take all the time you want. Oh, what's the use. Come on. Help me bring her to, she'll tell you. Snap out of it, come on Olive. Snap out of it. We know nothing about a body. We're shocked, hurt and indignant. Those old maids must have been seeing things. Let's check their story with the old maids. Is that necessary? Yes, it's necessary and you can come along just to see the job well done. It's no use, she's really out this time. Shouldn't we call a doctor, her heart? Oh, she's got a heart like a race horse. There, she's coming to now. Davy, darling, I'm back. Was it all just a bad dream? Olive, tell Deborah the truth, tell her the truth now! I love him, you can't have him. Oh, that's all, Mr. Galleo. Listen to me, Deborah. I'll take you next door, I'll prove this by Earthleigh himself. She's out again, you'd better look after her. I'm leaving. Oh Deborah, stick with me, you've got to believe me. I'll show you what I think of Olive. I'll take her right back where she belongs. I won't be a part of this monstrous lie. We both saw the body. There was an attempted murder and Mr. and Mrs. Earthleigh knew it. They saw her right in their living room. We saw no attempted murder. We're shocked, hurt and indignant. These old ladies keep seeing bodies like black spots before their eyes. - Liver trouble. - He's lying. All of us saw the body. We saw it first from our terrace. That's right, come here and I'll show you. [Florence] I was in here playing solitaire. I stepped out for a breath of fresh air, crossed over to the rail, looked down, there it was. (dramatic music) Oh! There it is again! Now tell me you don't see that Mr. Earthleigh, tell me that. Uh, this is where I came in. (gentle music) And that's exactly how she came to be there, you've got to believe me. Look, Olive is Arthur Earthleigh's girl, she doesn't mean anything to me. There he is, David Galleo, arrest that man, Officer, he's the murderer. Murderer? He's the one my husband's been shielding, I don't know why. But I've kept quiet long enough, arrest him. [Officer] Better come along, Galleo. Oh, what for? If you did what this lady said you did, we've got enough on you to get your charcoal broiled. (dramatic music) Will you kindly tell me what the charges are? (door knocking) Oh you poor girl, are you all right? Cheers everybody, having a party? Will somebody please explain what's going on here? I can explain the whole thing with the help of my friend and neighbor, Mr. Earthleigh. You leave Mr. Earthleigh out of this. How can I, Mr. Earthleigh is very much in it. Aren't you, Arthur. If Arthur's done anything wrong it's all your fault. You and your dog and your women. I suppose you're the new favorite of his harem. My dear Mrs. Earthleigh. Why don't you climb down from that stepladder respectability and look at people at eye level. You might like them. Really? Has it come to this. When a decent married woman must stand in her own living room and be insulted by a woman of your type. (slap thuds) Oh! Arthur! Arthur, she struck me! - Well, I'm sorry. - You're sorry! I'm sorry I didn't do it myself. [Mae] Arthur! Sit down, Mae. [Mae] He's out of his mind. I said sit down. - What? - Sit down! [Mae] Oh Arthur, what's come over you? I don't know, but it feels good. It started when I said goodbye to you Saturday. I've had a very exciting Saturday and Sunday. Hectic, but exciting. Not a dull moment. I drank and dined and listened to low-down music with a very entertaining young woman. She was crazy, but fun. Oh, Arthur! Don't interrupt me! It was only by accident that she spent the night here and she changed that stuffy little guest room of yours all around. And it looked fine. But I put it back because you wouldn't have liked it that way. Well I'm gonna have the whole place done over by Olive and Patricia Interiors. That's a splendid idea. Yeah, and furthermore, I'm going to have a dog. I like dogs. Rabelais' about to be a father and I'm putting in my bid right now for the biggest pup in the litter. It's yours. And furthermore I've never liked this thing! (glass crashing) And there goes your pineapple! (glass crashing) Officers, officers do something, he's gone mad. You bet I've gone mad. I see a plea of insanity coming up. Of course I'm crazy, crazy to put up with this all these years. Let me at that other pineapple. Now look here Mister, we didn't come here to referee any family squabbles. Just tell us, who was murdered and by who. No one was murdered by whom and no one attempted any murder, it was all a big joke, a practical joke. Who are you? Olive Jensen's the name, Miss Olive Jensen to you. Olive Jensen? You're the woman who's been missing for five days. Yes, and why haven't you found me! What kind of a police department have we got? Why I might have been lost forever. (bright music) They found him. Found who, dear? The Greenwich Village Murderer, captured in a rooming house on 96th Street. I always knew he was from Uptown. There they are now, two minutes late. Who, dear? The Earthleighs. Oh. Mae, you forgot the sugar again. Yes, dear. (bright cheerful music) Oh. (gentle music) Good morning! Good morning neighbor. Good morning. Oh David, you've forgotten the cream again. Yes, dear. Oh, he forgot the cream again. He's so forgetful. (dramatic music)
