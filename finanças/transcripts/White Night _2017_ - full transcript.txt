Fuck. Good day and good evening to you all as we begin this occasion that is Nuit Blanche. As you prepare for this night in your hotel rooms and motel rooms, in your homes and your offices we ask-- One sec. What is it that you have come to find? Is it a love that eludes you? A sense of self in your time? Howdy howdy. Good to see you. Yeah. Let me just get my jacket then we'll go, yeah. This night carries a warning. There's a weight to it, a ball and a chain. It is not to be taken lightly. Hey, I told you I can't make it. I can't, I gotta work. Look, Peterson asked me to stay personally. No I can't, I'm sorry. Have a good weekend. And as you go off into the night be sure to keep this in mind. The journey is not about the destination. Hi, how's it going can I help you? What's your name? I'm sorry I don't have a Melanie Boudreau. Boudreau, Melanie. Boudreau. Yes I'm sorry, we're very busy. I don't have your name. Sorry it's pointless we're full. I can't help you. It is instead about the moments, the discoveries, it is about the truths we unsurface when For you, the few true believers. For you tormented souls who do not sit content beware of what you might find. All right guys let's stick to the parks and the inner core. The streets are gonna be crazy tonight and it's supposed to drop below freezing so always stick with a buddy and keep each other in eyesight, let's do it. Two, three, four! Now I'm cheap and you were sold and I am sick And you were old, I play the fool, drown in gold Time is money, so I'm told, look I've come undone again Darling I can't be your friend, you were lost I'll win it on my own Oh roll your stone Deep into the night your stone You're blocking out the light, your stone But can you sleep alone And now you're old and not right, It's not gonna go, your stone Deep into the night your stone Blocking out the light your stone Can you sleep alone and are you holding on Or are you just starting to go, your stone Your stone Your stone So even though my hands may shake I know the myth is mine to make 'Cause all of you just take and take And bend my back until you break my bones Oh roll your stone Hey man sorry. Just give me, just this. Debit. All right. Here you go. So it's bottom of the ninth. We're down by two, bases are loaded and of course Greg Wayland pops over nothing, played the right field for a second out. And of course you're up next. So the crowd roars as I step up to the plate. There must've been 2-3000 of them this was no normal game, this was offset, almost national. So I watched that first pitch coming for a strike and then I waited it out as he was beginning to count. I could see it in his eyes, he's throwing one right down the middle, so he throws it and I take a full swing and crack it. Deep right field, I mean this is going. The crowds on their feet, you know will it make it? It's going, it's going. And Rory McCartney snags the ball at the wall ending the game. What? No the ball sails into the bleachers, we win, I become a legend in our school. I get so much pussy it's not even funny. Fuck off I'm not some bar slut you can pass your bullshit stories onto. I was there, I saw Rory grab that ball and I blew him under the bleachers after the game. Northern boys always have bigger cocks. Whatever. Plus you didn't get laid 'til grade 12 by Lindsay Galespie. Oh yeah. I was kind of jealous. What, you were never into me. Girl can have a crush. Maybe I was looking for you after that game. Really? No, you couldn't handle me back then. Can't handle me now. Camera, check. 24 to 105 millimeter zoom lens and check. 50 mil primer to make everything look blurry and pretty, check. Foldable raincoat for the inevitable rain. Pack of beef jerky, Red Bull, check, check, check. Three caps of shrooms. Mm. Don't pussy out on me now. They don't know, they don't know shit. You're a fucking Beretta and they believe every fucking word because you're super cool. And note to self re-watch Reservoir Dogs because it's super cool. So it begins. Batman Begins. I'm Batman. Stop what you are doing. You shouldn't be drinking that. Jesus kid you startled me. You know nearly 100,000 North Americans die each year from alcohol consumption? No that can't be true. Not to mention the who experience alcohol use disorders. Oh no I'm just a casual drinker, I don't really-- Less common side effects from prolonged abuse include anemia, dementia, cirrhosis of the liver and impotence. You're like a walking PSA, where are your parents? I lost them about an hour ago. What, there's like a billion people here, they're probably freaking out. Yeah. No no, we gotta find them. You don't know how stressful it is to be a parent. And you have kids? Well no but that's not the point. Look we gotta find them. Dylan? Dylan? Hey. Is this your kid? Dylan! God. Where have you been? We were worried sick about you. Oh. Thank you very much. Oh, no of course it happens. Thank you. There's so many people here. You're our hero, you rescued our baby. No problem, I'm glad everything's okay. Oh, thank the man. Thanks man. Thank you. No problem, take care guys. Oh, oh hey you forgot your mask. Hero. Hey Mom. I'm at my thing. Yeah, I told you about this for Nuit Blanche. Yes, yeah I was selected for the event. Yes officially. It's going. You guys gonna make it? Yeah, okay well it would mean a lot if you and Dad. No I know. I know he's busy, just it would mean a lot. Okay, all right, well hopefully I'll see you guys later. Okay, bye. Sorry, no French. Oui, a little. Again? Sorry I don't think you're gonna find one tonight. If you're gonna spend the night wandering Toronto at least you picked the right one. Enjoy the art. Oh my god this festival is so mainstream. Yeah you're so right. Do you want a sip of my organic soy macho herbal organic tea it's organic. Oh my god I thought you'd never ask, can I have all of that? Mah, Ozington, mah, pizza Lauretto, mah, faux, ramen, Dundas West, streetcar transfer, mah. Hey, I got a present for you. What? Merry Christmas. You stole this? What can I say, I thrive on danger. I'd say you have pretty mediocre taste for danger. You remember how we met? Y'mean when you baited me out for shoplifting at Zellers? I didn't bait you out. You might as well have, I'm shoving a shirt in my purse, I look over and you're staring at me. And the security guard's staring at me staring at you. Bait out. I apologize for that, and he chased me too, he thought I was in on it. We had to hide in Bulk Brand until we lost him. I bought you Hot Lips to apologize. That was cute. That's not how we met. What? We had civics together, Ms Hawthorne. Fuck off, I didn't know that, why didn't you tell me? I could tell that you didn't recognize me, and I don't know, guess I was kind of shy back then. You were, had to do a lot of work to get you out of your shell. Look at me now. Work in progress. Oh aren't you just so goddamn funny. Thank you very much, yes I am. I remember you gave this speech on the disassociation of kids with their parents. You remember that? I remember thinking in that Zellers, how is the girl that wrote that speech, stealing a crop top in front of me right now. Fuck, can't believe you remember that. Ah it's funny the things that just sort of stick with you. What in God's name? Cardboard boxes; this is embarrassing. Yeah; oh, unless. Maybe cardboard is an allegory for how shitty this installation is. Maybe it represents the inner suffering of anyone who looks at it. Like the feeling you get right before you vomit. Like when you know you're not gonna make it. But it's coming and there's nothing you can do about it? Yeah. I got it, maybe these are the boxes that they ship the real art in. I love how much of a bitch you can be. What are you ah, what you making? What is that? Uh, it's, if you took, me and bought it to the outside and brought it all to. It's kind of tough to explain. Looks like a bunch of boxes. It's more than just boxes. That's why I asked; the boxes are sweet, I didn't mean it like that, the boxes are dope, I feel like the boxes mean-- Look it's fine, seriously, it's fine, it's literally no different than what everybody else has been saying, so. What has everybody else been saying? Let's just say people's vocabularies don't really extend too far past the word shit. Oh my God, okay does that bother you? Yeah. Why? Do I know you? I don't know man, it's just. You put yourself out there and you work really hard, it's really disheartening having someone sum up your work in one monosyllabic expletive. Isn't that what being an artist is all about? No, I think that's what people have turned it into. Excuse me. And then what happened? And then I told that pussy ass bitch that if he so much as looked at me again, I'd knock his ass back to last Tuesday. Yeah yeah yeah then I spent the rest of the day at the mall, you know, picking up chicks. Yeah but weren't you in Hebrew school on Saturday. Shut up Kyle. You shouldn't be drinking that. Oh my God. Or loitering. Shit man, you know, shouldn't be sneaking up on people. Is that a mask? Yeah, it's, well it's not important what it is. What's important is that you shouldn't be drinking that. Did you know that nearly 100,000 people die, oh shit. Every year from alcohol and prolonged use can cause problems of the stomach and liver and impotence. Too much information buddy. You really think that we're gonna take life advice from a random dude in a mask who can't get it up? How old are you guys anyways, let me see some ID. Woah are you a cop? No, I'm a lawyer, well sort of, I was. I got fired today. That sucks man. Yeah, that sucks man. Nah, it's okay, I wasn't the kind of lawyer I wanted to be, I wasn't helping people. I don't know about the mask, but. The world would be a better place if more people gave a shit. Yeah man, go out there and make a difference. Thanks guys, I will, starting with this. Dude. For your own good! Come on! Did that really just happen. Stay in school! See I think this showcases like the emotional maturity of the artist. I see balls. Pain, I feel pain, suffering, suffering suffering. Suffering and pain. See I think it's about hope in the face of pain. For sure. This one I think the artist is trying to show how traditional imagery and symbols don't convey meaning in today's world. I mean balls, I totally see balls, do you see balls? Balls. See this I understand. Alright, well fuck 'em. Like, like fuck 'em yo. Eh, eh, fuck 'em, no honestly, look. Next time someone criticizes your work, you walk right up to them, you press your nose against their nose, you look 'em straight in the eye, and you say fuck you, uh! Seriously? Or don't, whatever, I don't care, that's what I'm saying. Andy Warhol would not have put up with this, especially from a bunch of hipster mouth-breathers that couldn't think up a better word than shit. Although I feel like maybe he would've loved the simplicity and frankness of that. I don't know, I failed art history, I'm sorry I couldn't be a better son, Dad! I will say this, I read the description of your installation, Me as I see it, in boxes. Okay? It's simple and cool and unpretentious and it caught my attention. Okay, well have a good night. Okay look, maybe it's just the shrooms talking, but there's beauty in this, it's real and so are you. And I'm really sad you couldn't tell me more about it. You're weird. You're beautiful. Can I have one? No. Okay. Breathtaking isn't it? Jeff. Melanie. Ah, it's a beautiful accent, you from France? Chaunigan. Chaunigan, sweet. I really don't speak much French. English? No, sorry. Cool, you two look happy, happy. Yeah I know what that one actually means, you miss her? Wait wait wait can I see that photo again? I think I've seen that photo on an installation. No no I swear, it was. I think it was actually closer down to City Hall there. I can take you there, if you want? Come, come come come, come. Come, I'll take you if you want. You know this night, it just is so unpredictable. It's like it's about adventures and new beginnings. Wait, woah, sorry, no I swear I just saw your mother's exhibit, I'm being sincere I'm a good guy. Where are you going? So what do you want to do? I don't know, walk around and make fun of shit. You're so jaded; come on, I mean some of these exhibits look pretty cool. Sure. What, what's up with you. I don't know, I'm bored, I want to do something. We are doing something. No like something awesome, I want to get in trouble, I want to fuck shit up, I want to grab the world by its balls and shove them in its mouth. That's oddly graphic. Do you remember that time we broke into the condo being built and climbed to the rooftop. And you yelled at a security guard who chased us and I fell and almost broke my ankle? Or the time we went skinny dipping and you literally broke your ankle hopping the fence? Sensing a pattern here. Let's go skinny dipping. Okay. Gather up everyone we see until we literally have hundreds of people, we'll descend upon the Dunbath pool like a flock of naked seagulls. It'll be like our own installation, completely spontaneous, the way real art should be. I'm in. It's too cold for skinny dipping, isn't it? Way too cold, it's practically winter. I'm the one who is scared of the situation If I'm alone please don't stare I'm the one who gives in to avoidance I don't need your friends My heart and thoughts scream argue and chide Complain of the differences Initial thoughts, don't think, just speak, go. Okay, it's pretty psychedelic, and really immersive and cool, something really inviting about it, I don't know, sometimes I think art can be a little exclusive and there's something very inclusive about this. What do you think of it? Sorry? How does it make you feel? I hadn't really thought about it or looked at it per se. Okay well put the camera down, turn to face it and really take it in. Huh, it's beautiful. Am I right? I can feel it, it's like the colors are reaching out and pulling me in, connecting everything around it. See, now I'm sorry but you would not have had that experience if you had watched it back tomorrow. Am I right, it's like live music or historic sites, some things are just meant to be experienced in person. Can you say that again, but this time louder, and articulate with more passion, here we go. And, action! No, you're just going to have to remember it for yourself, I mean come on, this night. We're surrounded by an amazing amount of original art that might never be seen again, so. Connect with it; isn't that what this night's about? Stop, criminal! Fuck, fuck! Dude what are you doing? I'm stopping you from committing a crime. No the mask, what's up with the mask? I don't know, it's my secret identity. Sounding really lame, man. It's not lame, it's heroic. You having a mental breakdown or something? Why do people keep saying that? Whatever man, it's not worth it. Hope you find the help you need. Jimmy Rathburne? Yep. Luke Chan? Yep. Bobby Latan? No. Alright yeah. Jason Morganson. Oh, yeah. Oh no I don't think I want that anymore. Come on; alright, fine, your loss. Hypocrite. Oh I'm a hypocrite because I didn't sleep with our entire graduating class? I was young, you're telling me you wouldn't have done the same if this was reversed? Not Bobby Latan. Come on, seriously, if every girl in school is throwing herself at you, I dare you to say you wouldn't have made a pass. Yeah but that's different. Why? Because. Because why? Because it is, because there's a difference. I'm digging myself a hole here. Yeah, you are. You're a misogynistic asshole. Easy there Amelia Earhart. That right there, that was so misogynistic. I don't know I guess I just, I think that it's different for girls and guys. Okay but your slutty phase in college, that was fine? Fine, that was awesome. Right so a couple years after high school when you finally learned how to talk to girls, you were right where I was. So forgive me if I'm just a little more mature than you and used that to my advantage to sleep around with anybody who'd pay attention to me. Forgive me if that's who I was? If you could go back would you change anything? Yeah; you? Everything. Sorry I inferred you were a slut. I'm sorry you tried so hard to be a slut and failed. Friends again? Yeah. Friends again; coming? Excuse me sir, you look cold, can I give you a blanket? Back off, I fought for this space, my right, you got no right to take it away. I only want to give you a blanket. Ah, I don't need your pity, your pity, I fuck your pity. Listen to me it's going below freezing tonight. You need to think about it-- You need to think about it, I fought for this. Leave me, they all left me, get the fuck away from me-- Hey, hey; look at me. You've been hurt, I can see that, but I'm not here to hurt you, okay, I'm not here to change you or fix you, I'm here because it's cold and I'm worried that if you don't take this blanket, you might die. And I don't want you to die. Why? Because no one deserves to die alone in the cold. I have a shelter-- Fuck shelters. I know a lot of them are dirty and dangerous, trust me, I know, mine is safe. This has the address, and my name is Stacey. You can tell them that Stacey sent you by the shelter. Now I don't need you to go to the shelter, okay, but I do need you to take this blanket. We're halfway through; for some, the night begins to wind down. For others, for the brave, it has just begun. In the valley Underneath the town You will find me Wilting in my pit of golden hours Waiting for the sun to trickle down I wait for summer Drops from the wicker tree down, down down This too will stray, stray Do not let them tell me all I know Do not let them tell me all I know Do not let them tell me all I know Do not let them tell me all I know Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below When you look up and it's not like a week ago Not like a week ago Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below When you wake up with those gray gray ghosts Set my bed on fire today Whiskey makes the trouble fade Weightless as you walk away No curtains but the window stays Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below Do not let them tell me all I know Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below When you look up and it's not like a week ago Not like a week ago Do not let them pull me down to the deep below Down to the deep below When you wake up with those gray gray ghosts Branches from the willow round I'm only certain of my doubt My many hearts are calling out And every one is filled with sound And dust is what will build the town And dust will always be crown Do not let them tell me all I know Do not let them tell me all I know Did you ever think you'd live to be this old? No, though I think I always felt this old. Yeah you did, you had no problem letting people know, either. Hey do you remember when we were in grade 10 you and me had a pact that if we weren't married by 27 we'd do it, get married? What? I don't remember that at all, really? Yep. You actually agreed to marry me? Yep, well that was before I knew what a douchebag you'd become. Man that was last year. We missed our chance. God can you imagine how old that must have seemed to us, 27 like the idea that at 27 your life was basically over so you might as well settle down. Yeah it's like that moment where you realize that some of your teachers were in their 20s. And they seemed ancient. Ancient, like in grade nine I had this smoking hot Spanish teacher, she must've been 21; miss Julie. God, my 20s were a blur, it's just getting blurrier. Do you think my life is over? What, no way! We're in our prime, I mean this is the best age you can possibly be, we've still got our looks but we're distinguished, worldly. We've got an appreciation for the finer things, yet we can still fuck shit up if we want to. We do still fuck shit up. Don't get me wrong, 30's gonna suck. Oh fuck 30's gonna be the worst. I'm gonna be so old. Well at least we'll be old together. I apologize for being a year late, but Violet Rebecca Spalding, who I have known since the ninth grade and who sat beside me in science class and who claims to have beaten me at an arm wrestle although she didn't actually beat me at an arm wrestle. Will you marry me? Tell you what, if neither of us are married by 45 it's on. Thanks! You're the worst. Well it appears ladies and gentlemen that in a shocking turn of events, the lady has turned down what may or may not have been a fake proposal. The gentleman who was clearly trying too hard stands and protests but to no avail. Isn't that right Andy? That's right Margaret, what a shameful, shameful performance on display this evening, honestly one of the poorest attempts I've ever seen since the great rejection of 1867 when King Henry the Eighth was spurned by the rejection of Princess Victoria and then promptly cut off her head. That's right Andy, I do remember, classic rejection. That's right Margaret, what. What, what? Oh, oh dear, this is not good Andy. This is not good at all. Oh pretty girl I let my ball out I saw me so I pulled her deep within Soon I was passing a lust for dancing Saw my chance so we flagged a cab from there And a portrait stared back from a bedroom wall And I poured in work so I'd get what I deserve I'm not debating on whether or not we were racing. I'm just pointing out the fact that I won. That is all kinds of infuriating, that is 50 shades of infuriating. Alright, I know there's some more exhibits this way. You don't speak French. What, I'm speaking French. I'm working with about a grade 10 level French here. Can I have a beer? Yes, right? Where is at the bathroom. Right, good! Can I sit on your face; no? No. Show me your genitals? No! No? No I would keep those to yourself. No big deal, just a real life superhero standing in the middle of the park, you got to talk to him, you got to talk to him. You got to talk to him. Oh my God you're a real life superhero, you're a real life superhero; do you have superpowers, can you fly, swim, go invisible, if I touch you will I go invisible? Did I do it, did I go invisible, am I invisible, hey dude, am I invisible? No you're not. Are you even a superhero? Yeah I am. What's your secret identity? I, well I don't have one. You don't have one, oh my God. What about The Golden Sparrow, or, El Goldinho, Boolean's Revenge. What? Of course, as your sidekick I'm also going to need a super dope sidekick name, I was thinking just, Sidekick. It's minimalist. Sorry kid, I work alone. Fine, one crime, but let me do the talking and don't interfere. You got it El Goldinho, El Goldinbro. I know a girl that needs our help, our first mission, it's our first mission! It's really impressive, just the sheer size of it. I mean Moshe Safdie meets cardboard. Hmm, it's really all it has going for it though. Yeah, I mean it's a bit avant garde but without any of the intellect or meaning, just sort of a shell of true art. Wow, this is amazing, this is so great and amazing. It's really just a pile of-- It's honestly breathtaking, it's exhilarating. It's pretty-- Alleviating. It's not that-- It's fucking awesome, is what it is. Alright. Yes. You didn't have to do that. I wasn't doing anything, I was just appreciating your creation. You were coming to my rescue, and I appreciate it but I don't need it. Nah I meant what I said I think it's amazing what you're doing here, it takes a lot of courage to make something and put it out there for everybody to see and to put yourself out there. We need all of this, it's what keeps us going through the bad, through work, through debt, heartbreak, fucking taxes. We need to know that something else is out there. You know, something that's outstanding, breathtaking. Alleviating? I guess that last one wasn't so great, huh? What's with the mask. It's stupid. I guess I felt like I've never really made a difference and I thought tonight I could change that by being a superhero for the night. No response. No I think that's the coolest response I've ever heard. So you better get out there because crime does not rest for the appreciation of art, right? Right. Well folks that appears to be our show, now I don't know about you but I definitely learned something, I was a little worried about our hero at first but in the end he seemed to prevail. As for the girl, I think she's gonna be just fine. She learned the true meaning of self worth and that nobody, absolutely nobody. What, I'm sorry excuse me for one second, just one second, I'm being told that it's not over. What do you mean it's not over, I'm wrapping it up, so. Right, oh, okay. Well folks, looks like it's not over. I am in for the long one, we've only just begun. My head feels heavy with a tidal wave My thoughts keep coming like a tidal wave I was lost but now I'm saved Now it's safe to get lost again You walk like you're falling over And I'm caving under your hand Oh, did you see it in the corner of your eye Black shadow scooping up the sky Oh, did you see it in the corner of your eye A black shadow scooping up the sky Something underground has been awoken It grew as it slept for a very long time And where will you run when it comes a-rumbling Yeah there's nowhere to run from your own mind You walk like you're falling over And I'm caving under your hand Oh did you see it, in the corner of your eye, Black shadow, scooping up the sky Oh, did you see it, in the corner of your eye A black shadow, scooping up the sky Oh did you see it, in the corner of your eye A black shadow, scooping up the sky Oh did you see it, in the corner of your eye A black shadow, scooping up the sky Suffocating. Hey, it'll be okay, you'll find a place. People from Toronto, we're not all bad. Emily. Mom, I'm so glad you could make it. Run the numbers again, no I don't care if it takes all night. Hi Dad. If they aren't balanced by Monday, somebody's head's gonna roll. Very impressive sweetie; what, oh shut up. Okay so I'm not done, I still have to work around the back and it's going to be a lot bigger. Yes it is quite, big. I'm sorry honey, I'm not very good with this kind of thing. What're you gonna do with it after? He's going to be the death of me, he's going to be the death of this company, he's going to be death of life on this planet as we know it. Just gonna take it down. Don't you want to do something more, important? I'm sorry not important, I didn't mean that, but you know, lasting, or impactful. What's the point of all this if it's just so fleeting. That's the, that's the point Mom, that's exactly the point, don't you see the beauty in something that's just so temporary, it only exists to be taken down? No, I don't. I got to get going, Richard fucked up the cost benefit analysis and everyone I work for is a moron and to be perfectly frank, I need to take a shit. Ew Dad. Honey, it's so great, it's so so great. Okay, got to go. Sorry Emily, good luck. What was she saying before. Uh, she said you're very beautiful. Aw, tell her thank you for me! You didn't pay attention at all in French, did you? I didn't have to because you always gave me all the answers, perks of being as awesome as I am. I just felt sorry for you. Whatever helps you sleep at night. Why do you keep looking at me like that? Okay. No, that way. Shall we? Alright thanks so much for the help tonight guys. Yeah, you want a ride anywhere? You know what, I'm good, I'm just gonna walk, take in the sights; ciao. Bye! Get lost. Shit. Back off. She said back off. Let him go. Alright, we get it, you're big, you're bad. You've made your point, now move along. Ooh, fuck, you can do this all night, I am not leaving, and I am certainly not letting you get to her. Oh shit. Go on, get out of here. Look man we don't need to do this. Come on hit him. Where? Anywhere. Oh shit. You okay? Yeah, are you? Yeah. Good. Lay it to me, tell me exactly how you hate it. And how I ruined your night with my fucking albatross of an installation, and how shitty of an artist I am just, how it has no place here or anywhere. Just tear me to pieces because trust me I've heard it all. Okay, I'll be honest that's kind of a relief. Hey. Thanks. My whole life I wanted to make a difference and I wanted to affect people, I didn't know this, I was so stupid, that's all I wanted was to change people's lives and I never did that. I never did anything extraordinary, nothing I've done is special. And it's a bit of a letdown when you realize that you are decisively average. Especially to your parents. Your mother was an artist? You really love your mom, huh? I've seen her before; yeah, she has an installation here, right? This picture. I think it was somewhere over there. Okay go, go find your Mom. I literally got none of that but, thank you. What the hell was that? What? All that conspiring against me. What, I may not speak French but I know enough to know that that was about me. You're jealous. Am not. You are, you're jealous, and it's kind of awesome. How is that awesome? Because. Because why? Because it is, because you always have the upper hand with your shoplifting, and your spiked heels, it's nice to get a win. What did she say. Nothing. What did she say. Really it was nothing. Sully what the fuck did she say? She said I should kiss you. What? She said that you were into me and that I was into you and that I should just kiss you because if I don't do it now then I'll never get a chance to which is crazy because-- She said you should kiss me? Yeah. I want to watch the sun as it pours Through the door, and lights up the cracks In the floorboards and moves Through the room to where you sleep Where it lights up the cracks In your skin, near ears It's at night when the moon pierce through My windows and heart You're a doctor or something? Sort of, I work for a shelter. A non-profit in the East end so I end up patching a lot of people up; can you do this for me? Alright, well nothing's broken but you should probably get that checked out. Uh, what's with the? Oh, this. Yeah. I don't normally wear a mask. Oh no? I got fired today, it's a long story, I was a lawyer, but I never really helped anyone. So I thought maybe that I could help someone, thought I would try this out. Probably look like such a weirdo. Please I don't care what you look like. What you did was heroic. Honestly the world needs more people like you. Not lawyers, yeah. Yeah. I think it's charming, the mask. Yeah? Yeah. Listen if you're looking for a job and helping people's your thing, we could always use more people like you. We could all use more heroics in our lives. Thanks; Stacey? Yeah. Thanks Stacey. Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut up! Shut up. Who are any of you to judge me? What's given any of you that right, nothing. Absolutely nothing. And you all stand so high on your towers of anonymity but not one of you spare me your amateur critique. Don't fucking laugh, right. Because it's so lame and mediocre and boring and shitty. Well fuck you, fuck all of you. And your bullshit judgment. Because I didn't make this for you, I made this for me, not because I wanted to, because I had to, because I needed to put every ounce of me into something, and I don't judge it, I don't try to understand it, I accept it, the way that I would accept any of you. So you can all go fuck yourselves. It still sucks. Hey folks, well I guess it's about time for me to say something cool to end things off, right? To sum up the evening and bring us all a little closure, bring us in for a smooth landing. Hey. Stole my Buddha, that woman stole my Buddha. I don't know what you're talking about man! But I say fuck that shit; the sun is about to rise, it is no longer evening, there will be no closure, our airplane is headed for the rocky shores. Thank you. Stole my Buddha, give it back! Let me guess, duty calls. Yeah, looks like it. Be careful; bye. Hey, who are you? El Goldinho. Oh man that's stupid I'm going to think of something better. You are tired and bruised and battered and broken and bleeding, you have seen the unseeable and heard the unspeakable. You have traversed the masses, the upscales, the socialites, the lowbrows, the slum-stick gutters of tomorrow and for what? Stole my Buddha, give it back! El Goldinho, he needs my help! Art, love, just words to some, not all. And for those of you who tonight have truly lived, this is for you.
