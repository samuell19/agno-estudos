I love you. I can't believe you're cooking for your own party, and you look perfect. - I'm beyond jealous. - Thank you. Turning into her own Karen Taylor. Seriously, where's the TV crew? Shh, shh, shh. Okay, Ted's a little sensitive about his mom. I would be too. I'm just saying it's a good thing she's not here, because I'd be all up on her for an autograph. You really would. Perfect. Mmm, those look yummy. I have to feed him. Where's your bathroom? Oh, it's just down the hall. That's gonna be you soon. One step at a time. You guys don't want to hear the engagement story. Yes. All right, all right. Now that you're all drunk enough. Okay, New York City, sightseeing, we're at the Empire State Building. We're in line to get to the top. And I didn't even realize of course the Empire State Building has metal detectors. I don't know what to do. The ring's right here in my pocket. We keep getting closer and closer. I'm sweating bullets at that point. Em, why don't you finish it? - No. - Oh, come on. You tell it way better than me. You're right, okay. All right. Well, I am not even thinking about him. My stomach is doing somersaults at the thought of even being at the top of this building. She never told me she was scared of heights. Not scared, terrified. So, we're about to reach the metal detectors... And he is green, and I think, "Oh, my God, he's more scared than me." I try and go talk to the guard. I mean, I don't know. I figure I can maybe slip him a 20, he can pass it through. I think he's asking where the bathroom is so he can... This guard, he's a big New Jersey bouncer type. Not having it. Before I even know what's happening, he is down on one knee in front of this crowd of tourists. And she loves making a scene in public. So... did you say yes or what? Becca! I am so glad you're here. Mmm. I shouldn't be. I'm so mad at you for not telling me you're marrying a Taylor twin. - Shh. - Oh, my God. You were, like, obsessed with them. Okay, we're gonna bring that up? Seriously, though, last time I saw you you were single. He was a client and then... this happened. Illicit, I love it. Did you charge him more for that? - Oh! - Ow! Bruising's bad for the career. Fashion Week is over, so suck it up. Where's Gram? Oh, no, is she okay? She's old. The doctors don't want her leaving unless she has to. Mmm, well she'll make it to the wedding, though. I really hope so. So I was thinking maybe if I pull the wedding date forward... I mean, is that crazy? No, if it's right, it's right. And you're lucky that you found someone while she's still here to see how happy he makes you. What's the deal, though? I mean, I remember his brother was in an accident, and Karen Taylor's still MIA. Aren't there, like, lawsuits and insurance things? How are you dealing with all of that? - I'm not. - Hey! Becca, right? Hi. It is so good to finally meet you. You too, Ted. I can't believe you're here in the flesh next to my little kiwi. Shh. You know, this one used to tape every holiday special of your mom's show... How red is my face right now? The infamous Taylor Twins. God, you guys are like local royalty. Becca, just stop. She's just being shy. Em, what's up? Nothing. Let's get you some champagne. Yes! Ah! Oh, that was stupid. Oh, man. Hey. - Hey. - Frank... You're back. Hey, Teddy. Just Ted these days. What are you doing here? You know you can't keep me away for too long. This must be Emma. It is nice to finally meet you. - You too. - Oh. How long you in town for? Not sure yet. Maybe I'll stay a while. Well, I'm sure Ted is very excited you're here. Yeah. It's great to have you here. Anything you want to say? Hmm? You have not taken your eyes off your brother since he got here. I'm just really surprised to see him. Frankie! Welcome back, bro. Hey, Drew. - Mmm. - Long time. Mm, goddamn right. Can you believe Ted is getting married? But, hey, listen. I hope that you're not upset about the best man thing because... you weren't around, you know? Yeah, it's all good, Drew. - It's fine. - Yeah? Yeah. What are you drinking? Is that water? That's not the Frankie I know. How about a little shotski? I don't drink anymore. Come on, just a little shot. - No, Drew. No. - Just one, just do one. I said no! Okay? God, I'm... I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Here, I didn't mean to... - It's fine. - Hey, hey. Where have you been, Frankie? Just traveling. Yeah? I... Were you trying to figure out where your mom disappeared to, because that was just crazy, right? But I think that we all knew that she was just, you know... a little just off, right? - Hey. - Ugh. Aw! No! No! Do something! Stop, man, come on! What are you... Hey! Frank! Sorry. Sorry. I don't know what happened. I'm so sorry. Back in town two hours, and I ruin your engagement party. Well, you always knew how to make an entrance. He mentioned Mom. What am I supposed to do? He was drunk. Okay, he knows it's a touchy subject. You're lucky you didn't break his nose. Yeah, well... looks like we're picking up right where we left off. Golden boy and the screw-up. Don't do that. It's true. We look out for each other. Remember, it goes both ways. So, are you staying here while you're in town, Frank? Frank usually stays at the family home. I mean, I just assume. Sure. I don't want to impose. No, no, it's no trouble. No, I think you'll be a lot more comfortable there, and we're still settling in here. So, I think that makes the most sense. It's funny, I didn't realize you still owned that house. Well, until we know what's happening with Mom, I... it just didn't make sense. I can't believe Ted hasn't given you a tour. A lot of memories in that house. Should've moved in there rather throwing away your money on this place. It's a great spot to raise a family. This room's gonna make a great nursery. Is that what you think? And, what, I just lose my office? All right. All right, I guess. It's time we start thinking about building an addition. Why didn't you tell me about your mom's house? I... I'm sorry. Honestly, I put it on the market last year and nothing happened. And now with work picking up... I don't want any secrets. It's just a house. Besides, now we have a wedding to worry about. That's right. Can't back out now. Are you sure you want to do it so soon? The fall is so beautiful. Yeah, I know. It's just, I'm going to be traveling a lot over the next month. The German company loved my network solutions. Really? They want us to do the whole Frankfurt office. That's great. Not if it means you planning a shotgun wedding on your own. I'm not going to turn into Bridezilla. I just want something small. Just close friends and Gram. And Frank... of course. I'm sorry about tonight. What is wrong with him? Is he okay? Yes, yes, he's fine. He's just... he's always had a bit of a temper. But things got really bad after Mom left. He drank a lot, and then... the motorcycle accident. But... but they put him on medication. They got him evened out. Honestly, I haven't talked to him in forever. For him to just show up like that... But I'm happy that you finally got to meet him. You're family now. Wish your mom could be here too. I'm sorry, but it's weird. Someone must be in touch with her. Christmas cards, birthday cards every year, never a return address. I wish one of us had a parent who could be there. If Gram doesn't make it... Hey, she will. She'll be there. And it will be perfect. I promise. You're wearing my favorite shirt. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. You want it back? Yeah, I think I do. Oh, you do? Hey, stop. I don't think so. I'm serious. I saw something. Out there. Who cares? Em, this is amazing. It's one thing to look at it on paper, but to see it actually happening. Oh, please tell me this is good news. The city council couldn't be happier. We're on schedule and currently under budget, which is completely pissing off the other contractors. Well, I told them our budget. They overbid. Mm-hmm. Oh, Emma, you were just here the other day. You know I would be here every day if I could. Well, it's always wonderful to see you, my lovely girl. So, um, how's the park coming along? Oh, we started work on it today. It's going to be something really special. You know there used to be a soda shop there. Did I tell you this? Tell me again. Well, that's where I met your grandfather. Oh, he was such a gentleman. You don't see many of those these days. Like Ted. When I looked into his eyes, I knew he was special. I wanted to tell you... I picked a date for the wedding. Oh, that's lovely, dear. It's the 29th. For your birthday? I hope that's okay. Oh, sweetheart, that's... That's just perfect. I'll be back as soon as I can. Are you going to be okay on your own? I lived on my own for years before you. I think I got this. Five stars. Better have a charger. Go, before I don't let you. Call you when I land. You better. Frank! Did I scare you? What the hell are you doing here? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'm here to see Ted. Ted's out of town. Right, that's... that's right. He said that. And I forgot. I'm sorry. My mind gets a little unreliable sometimes. Were you in the bathroom just now? No. No, I wouldn't do... I got out of the shower, and the door was open. I don't know. I'm sorry. It's just, Ted and I... we've always had keys to each other's place. It's just a force of habit. Frank, this is my house now. You can't just show up. Sure. Right. I... I understand. Great. So...? Oh, I should... I should go downstairs and let you get changed. Thank you. Yeah. Frank? Are you still here? Frank? Frank! Frank. - Mom? - What? No, it's Emma. Oh, what happened? You passed out. Don't move, okay. I'm gonna call an ambulance. No, no. I'm fine. You were unconscious on the kitchen floor. You're anything but fine. Aw, I just need to go home and take my meds. Is this because of the accident? What did Ted tell you? Nothing, just... just that you lost control of your bike. Is that what happened? Yeah. I need to go. Don't worry about me, okay. Wait. Let me walk you back. Make sure you get home all right. I'd appreciate that. I'm really sorry about before. It's not your fault. If it's a medical condition, there's nothing... No, no, no, no. I... I'm sorry about lying to you earlier. I knew Ted was gone. I came to see you. I didn't realize how late it was. I just... I want to get to know you a little bit. You know, you're going to be my sister after all. But, hey, listen. If you don't want me to come around again, I completely understand. No, hey, that's not it. Of course... of course, I want you around. Just... Just promise me you'll start using the doorbell from now on. Sure. And here we are. Home sweet home. Frank? You lost? Yeah. Never was a good follower. Sorry, I had to grab these. You don't want me blacking out on you again. You know, I used to watch your mom's show religiously. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Never missed an episode. And when you and Ted were on... well, to be honest, I was kind of jealous of you guys. Why's that? Come on, your mom was beautiful and kind. And all those amazing little things she'd make. I never really knew my mom. So, Karen Taylor... she was like the next best thing. Yeah, well... she definitely put on a good act for the cameras. I mean, don't get me wrong. She was a great mom. It's just, she could be difficult. Unlike you. I better you're never difficult. Please, I'm sure Ted would tell you otherwise. You know... you look a lot like her. Especially when you smile. I'm sorry. Did I say the wrong thing? No. No, I'm flattered. You should be. She was stunning. You know, Ted and I... always shared everything. What are you doing? Nothing, I just thought... - You thought what? - Sorry. Please. - I got to go. - Let's just forget about it. It was stupid. Emma, wait. Let me explain! It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. No. You had to deal with that. kae I don't think he meant any harm. I guess he just forgot to take his medication. It just scared me a little. He didn't try anything, did he? What is this? They made me check it for the flight. This was my father's. Only thing he ever gave me. You never told me that. Yeah, well, that's about the only good thing you'll ever hear about him. I think that's where my brother gets some of his darker tendencies. I'm gonna go talk to him. Ted, you don't have to do that. No, this is important. Okay, he needs to know that he can't just show up like this. We're not kids anymore. You just got home. - It can wait. - No, it can't. We're going to start a family here. There are certain boundaries he can't cross. Because it's their job. Frank? What do you do all day? No, Marcus, Marcus. Figure it out! Figure it out, and don't call me back until you do. - Hey. - Hey. You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. Sorry. After what happened with Ted, I promised myself I'd stay calm, but Marcus just always has a way of pushing my buttons. You know people like that? Yeah, of course. Marcus, he's your...? Mom's business partner. He basically still runs things. Hey... I'm glad you came over. Ted told me to stay away from the house, but I wanted to apologize about the other night. The way I acted was crazy. Okay, I know that. I promise you I wasn't going to try anything. It's just... it was nice to have company for once. You know? It was like having Mom back in the house. Well, the whole night was really awkward. Yeah. I just don't want my problems to get in between you and Ted. I was just kind of hoping we could start over. - Clean slate? - Yeah. Yeah, I would really like that. What's that? Uh, how do I say this nicely? Your yard's a wreck. I was thinking maybe I could give you a hand. Your grandma raised you, right? That's what Teddy said. Gram, yeah. Yeah, now she's in the nursing home. I don't get to see her as much as I'd like. Well, she knows you're busy. Yeah. Wish I could see her more. I know she gets lonely in there. I try to take her flowers whenever I can. What? That's really sweet. Okay, so on her first date with my grandpa, she says he brought her a bouquet of the brightest sunflowers she had ever seen. Apparently, they were my mom's favorite too. So, you know, whenever I can. I bet she's really proud of you. Yeah, she's seen me working on this park project for years. And now the wedding. I'm sure she hopes you start a family. You know, she probably wants some great grandbabies running around. I don't know, it's like I'm finally getting to where I want with my career. I mean, sure, I would love that, but, I mean... wait a few years. I don't know if she'll make it that long. What's this? Can't a future wife bring her hardworking man a cold one? Come on, you're not that kind of wife. Don't tell me what kind of wife I am. Mmm. Ah. There she is. Okay, so I was thinking, I really want to do the wedding on the 29th for Gram's birthday. Babe, that's so soon. We're never going to find a venue that's not booked. Which I why I was thinking we could do it at your mom's place. I was over there today with Frank helping with the yard. It is so beautiful. You were... you were alone with Frank? Yeah. Why? Was he... okay? I mean, he was kind of weird. But that's just him, right? I think I just blew things out of proportion the other day. Still, I'd feel better if you didn't go over there without me. Why? You're the one who told me everything was fine. Why do I get the feeling you're not telling me everything? No secrets. - You promised. - Okay. Frank hasn't been traveling. What? What do you mean? Where has he been? In a hospital. What kind of a hospital? Psychiatric. What? You don't think you should have told me that? I spoke with the doctors the day after he showed up at the party. They assured me that they cleared him to check himself out... It's fine. It's not fine, Ted. We're about to get married. That's not the type of thing you hide from your wife. I wasn't hiding. Well, what was he there for? Did he hurt anyone? No, no, no. Nothing like that. It's just because of the blackouts. The doctor said that he'd be fine as long as he takes the medication. And what if he doesn't? Just... Just be careful, okay? I love my brother, but you are the most important thing in my life. And... if you want to get married at the house, I just want to do what makes you happy. And if that's what makes you happy, then let's do it. You're what makes me happy. When you're not working. Mmm, okay. Oh, let's just get married now. Okay. Be careful. Already starting to see some wrinkles. Hardly. SPF 110. What? They make that? I have the skin of a baby seal. I talked to the caterer, told 'em roughly 50 people. He gave me some B.S. ungodly number. But I argued him down 25%. He'll email you tomorrow. Thank you. I had no idea how hard this would be. You need a coordinator. But with the timeframe that I gave them, everybody's quote was double my budget. We will have someone on the day. Those Taylor genes are really something, huh? God, your kids are gonna have such great hair. Introduce me. Hey. You just waking up? Yeah, haven't exactly been sleeping great lately. You guys done for the day? No, no, we're just gonna take a quick break, go visit the florist. Oh, Frank, this is... - Becca. - Hey. We didn't get a chance to meet at the party. I'm... sorry about that. I... I've seen you around before. You're the model friend, right? Model and best friend. And notoriously single. Becca. Miss wants to keep the twins all to herself. Yeah, well, Chase is going to stay here and work while we go out. Sure. Nice to meet you, Frankie. Yeah, you too. You're the greatest maid of honor ever. Thank you. For everything. Anything for my little kiwi. Call you later. Chase? Hey. What are you doing here? Hey. Is Chase around? No. I helped him finish up out back, and he took off. Really? Did he say where he was going? No. Frank, are you okay? I just need to take my meds. It's not one of my good days, you know. Do you want me to hang around for a while? No, please, I'll be fine. I just need to rest. Do you want to come over for dinner? Thanks. Maybe another night. Yeah, yeah, sure. Later this week? It's the least I can do to thank you for all the work you've done. The garden looks amazing. That'd be great. All right. Oh, hey, um... I wanted to... Are you and Ted... Are you guys trying? I mean, you're not on birth control, right? Excuse me? I... I'm sorry. I know that's none of my business. No, it's not. It's just that I know how bad Teddy wants to start a family. You want kids, right? We're focused on the wedding right now. Right. Of course. I just don't foresee myself getting married anytime soon, you know? Be a shame if we couldn't pass down our mom's legacy. I think she'd really like that. Sorry. I should go. Chase, it's me. Thanks for helping today. Uh, I guess just gimme a call when you get this. Please. Looks great. Emma Kelly? Yeah, can I help you? I'm Detective Clark. I wanted to, um, ask you a few questions about an employee of yours... Chase Harris. Yeah, of course. I filed a report with the police last week. I hadn't heard anything. Is that why you're here? We think there may have been an incident in New York last week. We found his phone and a few other items in Bushwick. Looks like you were the last person he called. Yeah, well, he came into work on Tuesday. He was helping me with a project at my in-law's place. You're married? Uh, sorry, about to be. Ted Taylor, Karen Taylor's son? He was helping me get everything ready. I went into town to run a few errands. When I got back, he was already gone. Do you think something happened? It's too early to know. If you think of anything... give me a call. Oh, and congratulations on the wedding. My mom and I used to love watching Karen's show. Frank? Frank! Oh, this is a bad idea. Come on, Chase, give me a clue. Get out of here! It's not my fault. The detective said they found his phone in New York. You spoke to a detective? Emma, what are you doing? He has been missing for over a week. He knows how important this wedding is to me. No, something happened. You think Frank had something to do with it. That's insane. He was acting really strange. Like, maybe he... maybe he forgot to take his medication and something happened. Frank's a little off, yes. But he wouldn't kill anybody. I'm not saying that he killed him. What are you saying? You know, I feel like you're trying to rip us apart. This is an unpaid toll ticket for Frank's car from last week. How you'd get that? Frank was in New York right after Chase went missing. This is proof. He went to New York to meet with Marcus. What? Mom's business partner, Marcus Swinton. We're buying him out of a stake in the business. Frank went there to finalize the paperwork. I'm pretty sure he didn't have time to kill anybody while he was there. Come on. Hey, I'm sorry. Okay? I'm sorry about Chase, and I'm really sorry that I'm not able to be there to help you with all this. Just a few more days here, and then I'm all yours. All right? I love you. And I know I'm a little sensitive about Frank. I talked to a psychiatrist. I got a few recommendations. Things are going to be better. Were you there... when your mom left? Uh, Frank was there. And, um... I don't know. I keep thinking that maybe if I had been there I could've talked her out of it. Why? Nothing. It'd be nice to have a mom around. Hi, is this Marcus? Speaking. It's Emma Kelly, Ted Taylor's fiancée. Hi, what can I do for you, Miss Kelly? I was just wondering, did Frank meet you in New York last week? That's right, yeah. Is something wrong? No, no. I'm just updating the calendar. What day was that again? Must have been Thursday. So what was that? The 15th? Look, I'm sorry to bother you, but Karen was your business partner. You must have some idea where she is. I can't imagine she wouldn't have contacted you. Karen Taylor is dead. I'm sorry? I can't prove it, but only a crazy person would walk away from the empire that we built, and she was a lot of things, but crazy was not one of them. There must be some reason. Creative differences, financial problems? Show had the highest ratings that it had ever had. Things were perfect. And then poof. She just vanished. Anything fishy about that to you? Well, what about the police? No body, no case. Ted says he still gets Christmas cards. Yeah, me too. You know what's funny though? It's not her signature. I was her business partner. I must have seen her sign a thousand things. It's not her. Sorry, I shouldn't be telling you this. But you should know what you're getting into. Unbelievably gorgeous, like magazine-perfect. It's really happening. - Are you okay? - Yeah. You look like you're about to pass out. No, it's just it's... It's real now. You're not having second thoughts, are you? No, no. It's just... It's all this pressure. And where is Chase? I mean, he should be here. It's driving me crazy. You know Chase. Chase will turn up. He would die before missing your wedding. Oh, bad choice of words. I realize now. I think we all just need a girls' night out. I can get Tony to watch the baby. No, Becca, I already said no bachelorette. - Did you hear me say that word? - Never heard it. We can just go somewhere quiet, have a couple drinks. Becca, no, no, no. Oh, fine. Well, before we go, I got you a little present. What? I should be buying you guys gifts. Just open it. Thank you. It's beautiful. 10-7. It's the day you guys met. I am shocked you remembered that. Uh, she didn't. Ted mentioned it at the party. Well, I am shocked he remembered that. Mr. Details, yeah, right. Okay, I'm going to be the one that forgets our anniversary. After the first one, it doesn't really matter. I love you girls. Oh, okay. Just one drink. Oh, my God. Okay. It's just a few drinks. Honey, you had all the drinks. When did you get so heavy? I am a heavy clomper. Okay, down with you. Oh, ow. Oh, no! Thank you so much, Becs. You're right, I needed a night like that. You're just my best everything. You're my best everything. My little kiwi. Okay, you good? Kiwi, kiwi. - Kiwi, kiwi. - Okay. I love you so much. I love you too. Okay, I'll call you tomorrow. You need anymore water? No. No more drinks. I'm fine. You should stay home. I mean, go home. Go home, please! Okay, drunkers. Just get some sleep, okay? You got a big week coming up. Oh, my God! You're here. I missed you so much. I missed you too. Wait, why are you here? I thought you were coming home tomorrow. Is it then already? Oh, yeah, well, we finished up early, and I changed my flight around. You didn't get my text, did you? Uh-uh, uh-uh. If I didn't know any better, I'd say you're a little bit tipsy. What? No. Was this the unofficial bachelorette party? There were no strippers, I promise, none. Yeah, well, the night is young. That is true. I am really sorry about what I said about Frank the other day. Hey, don't worry about it. It's just you and me tonight. Oh, look what the girls got me. 10-7. The day we met. Because I remember. Come on. Come on! Wait. Where is it? Ted? Who was here when I was gone? I said "Who was here?" Was Frank here? No. No, no one else was here. Why? What's wrong? Is something missing? Nothing, just... just some documents from work. I... I probably just left them at the office. Hey, hey, I'm sorry, okay? I didn't mean to blow up at you like that. I'm just... I'm just stressed. I'm sorry. Do you forgive me? Well, it's not exactly the way I wanted to wake up after such an amazing night. Yeah, what'd you do? I guess I never told you. Becca and Jackie took me out. Honestly, it's a little foggy. We danced our asses off. I haven't had a night like that since college. Yeah? Well, it's good to blow off some steam. Especially before the craziness of this week. I think blowing off steam. I love you. I just have to take care of a few things, and then I'm all yours. Okay? Thank you. Yeah? Wow. Really? You do. I hit the gym every now and then. - Hey. - Hey, Em. Great party. Can I talk to you for a moment? Sure, hon. Don't go anywhere. - Be right back. - Okay. I know you think that he's kind of strange, but something's about him that just makes me want... Becca, you know I would never get involved in your love life. Do me a favor. Stay away from him. Come on, Em. You know I've dated plenty of guys with a medicine cabinet full of wacky pills. Yeah, I'm serious. I'm worried about him. He's had problems in the past. Haven't we all though? Becca, I don't want to lose you too. What is that supposed to mean? Nothing. Nothing, just... please? Okay. I'll be cool. Don't worry about me. You're not having any? I don't really drink anymore. Oh, come on. Just one glass. It's a special occasion. I... I really shouldn't. Oops. Too late. Can't let it go to waste now. Mmm, just so we're clear, tonight is just between the two of us. I don't need any lectures from Em. If it works out, it works out. If not... May I? Please. So, how long have you known Emma? From the beginning. When she moved here from New Zealand to live with Gram, I was the first kid she met. And we were... Insta-friends. She doesn't have an accent. Yeah, she lost it years ago. But I still hear it sometimes. It comes out when she drinks. So, was she serious with anyone? Before she met my brother? Em was serious about every guy. Bridal Barbie was her spirit animal. But I can see the way she looks at Ted. He's different. Good. Did she... she tell you about me? Are we just gonna talk about Emma all night? I was... I was just... you know, checking things out for Ted. I didn't... I'm sure you did the same thing, you know, for Emma. May-be. You know... You look a lot more beautiful than your pictures. Impossible. Real life's not Photoshop. That's what I mean, though. You're... a natural beauty. Mind if I use your bathroom? Sure. Upstairs to the right. Hmm. Hmm. That's a new one. Becca? Oh, you scared this piss out of me. You left the sink on. Did I? Sorry, I was looking for a hand towel. In the office? Busted. Your house needed my patented first date snoop session. I had to know what I might be getting into. You check my computer? May-be. Come on, let's just go back down... I'm just gonna go, okay? I can't let you tell anyone. Stay away from me! Somebody help me! Oh, my God. Oh... Let me get this. Oh. Then we only have to fix half your makeup. There you go. You don't think it's... No. No. No, you're right. It's probably just nerves. Where's Becca? Something's wrong. I know it. She'll be here. Thank you. Ladies, how are we doing? It's almost time. I'm not getting married without Becca. I've seen this far too many times. Look, when life gives you lemons, you take those lemons, and you throw them in life's face, and you say... "I ordered a martini, goddamn it." I'm gonna need a moment. I need a moment to myself, please. Oh, oh, oh. By all means. Five-minute warning. It's bad luck to get married on the hour. Knock knock. - It's bad luck to... - Frank. Relax. Can you give us a second, please? Hey. Hey. I just want to say that I'm really happy you're marrying my brother. You're a beautiful bride, and you're going to be a beautiful mother. One day. Thank you. Well, I'll see you out there. Frank? Yeah? Did you see Becca last night? At the rehearsal dinner. After the dinner. No. Why? Where is she? I'll see you out there. How are we supposed to explain this? You told me to find out what Emma told her. I was trying to protect you. I didn't know she'd go snooping around. You know, none of this would have happened if you would've just kept the video in my safe. Well, I was tired of you holding it over me. Stay in the hospital, or I'll tell people what really happened. You'd tell people I did it. Well, you buried her, didn't you? You filming this? I didn't kill her. Hey, come on! I told you a thousand times. She fell. She fell. But how would that have looked, huh? What was I supposed to do? I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I just want to make things right. Frank! He's lying to you. Where'd you put the body? I know you killed her, Teddy. She told me so herself. What the hell are you talking about? You killed her because she wouldn't give you the money to start your little company, and you held it over me with the goddamn video. Ted, what did you do? What did you do? You were the one always talking about wanting to come clean. You are a sad, weak little mama's boy. And I can never trust you. I still can't. Well, I deleted the video, Ted. - You didn't. - I did. But I made a new one for you. Do you want to see? Ted, you feel so good. This is the same knife I used to cut your brakes. Hopefully, this time you actually die. Help! Help! Somebody! Help! My brother! Hel... Babe? Babe, thank God. Frank attacked me. You were right. How could you? Your own mother? Listen, I don't know what you think you heard, honey. I saw the video, Ted. Um, it's not what you think. Where's Frank? He's... Well, he's dead, sweetie, but... You killed him too? I wouldn't have had to if you'd just left things alone! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, it's not your fault. It's not your fault. Frank. Frank was sick. He was sick, and he was obsessed with you. If you knew what he did... And your mother? That was an accident. Okay? I could explain everything. Let's just get married. Gram's here. Everything you want is right outside that door. Okay? Just come on. No. Emma, come on. Emma. Come here. Stay away from me. Just... get away. Emma, come here. Just stay away from me. Emma! Emma, come here. Don't make me do this! Come here! Let go of me! - Let go! - Ow! Ow! Bitch! Emma! Emma! Emma. Emma, baby? It doesn't have to be this way. Just talk to me. Hey, come here. - No! Let me go. - Come on. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen, listen. The only thing that matters is us. Please, listen, please. Please don't throw that away. - I love you. - Let go of me. I love you, I love you. Let me go! Let me go! Come on. We can be happy together. We just have to throw all that behind us. We can be happy together. Aah! Come here! - Ah! - Come here. Come here. - No, no. No! - Come here. Help me, Frank. She's gonna tell them what we did. Help... me... please. I'm sorry, mother. Aah! Ah! Ah! Aah! Ugh! Ugh! - Ah! - Aah! Grab me. Grab my hand. Hold on, Frank. - I can't. - Hold on! - Aah! - No, no!
