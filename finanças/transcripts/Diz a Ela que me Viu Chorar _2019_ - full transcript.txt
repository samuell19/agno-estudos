LET IT BURN SOCIAL HOTEL PARQUE DOM PEDRO SÃO PAULO, BRAZIL You should get a smaller ring, right? What, honey? Yours fell off. We should get you a smaller one, right? It slipped off. It was too loose. I told you it would happen, didn't I? Yes, you did, honey. I'll buy a new one. I'll get you another one. Don't get one too tight. Get one a little loose. A little bit like this. Bring it on Monday. Not on Monday. Tomorrow, when you arrive. I'll get you a larger one. What are you doing, honey? Let me see. I'll get you a larger one. Yes, a larger. It has to be larger. My fingers are thick. I'll get you a larger. Monday I'll do it. Right? - 1, 2, 3... - Go. Go, go, Andrea. Look, the cat's hair. You're strong, girl. You're strong. It's slipping. It's slipping. My hand is wet, and it slipped. Yeah, you're strong. I'm weak. - Now with the left arm. - Now I'll lose. Put your hand in the back so you can't lean. What a strong woman! Go, Andrea! When a vulture passes over, they say it takes away the bad energies. Where’s the vulture? - There, three. - So it's full, huh? They say vultures take away the negativity, the bad energies, the bad things. Once, there were vultures flying, but it wasn't bad energy. A woman had been dead for six days in the house. Still it was something rotten, that had to go. Six days... Six days... Look at the train. This week I’ll take some clothes to my mom's. - When will you go? - During the week. - Next week? - In the middle of the week. I’ll take some clothes to wash there too. You're so ridiculous. Sometimes, you get so ridiculous. – Didn't I already tell you? – A bunch of times. – I will always tell you. – A bunch of times. And you will never forget my words. – Never. – You stupid. – I'll never forget it, Andrea. – No, you won't! – I won't. – You won't. There will always be a little bit of Andrea everywhere you go, with everyone you see. – I'll remember... – Help us all. Going down. – Is this the fourth? – That's it. Going down? Go, bro! He's gonna put his hand on his heart and start running. Piti, go over there. Don't pee and shit here. Your father won't clean it. He doesn't even fold his sheets. Go over there! No, Piti! No! Over there! Over there, Piti! Over there! This carpet is not for you. Don't even think about it. Has a junkie arrived? I heard the voice of a junkie. No, it wasn’t. But I think I heard the voice of a junkie. I told you I heard from afar! That thing smells good. – Before I am humiliated... – Take your hand off your heart. I don't want to work as a doorman, I want to work at the bar. I am going to fuck with your high. If no one lets me get high, I'll fuck with your high. The doorman is deaf, the doorman is dumb I'll fuck with your high. All he does is wave He never went to school, he doesn't know how to speak Wait till midnight... Go! I'll have some tequila You'll know what, I'll drink Montilla. I'll fuck with your high! I told sargent William to go fuck himself. Don't start with that shit. Piti! Piti! Give it to me! If I had money I'd spend it all on ice-cream, and cocaine, like a playboy. The important thing is to buy Calvin Klein and Jequiti. He'll start babbling nonstop. The other one is paralyzed. At least he took his hand from his heart. And the other one babbles nonstop. I feel like buying a pipe. It's light. Do you know why? Get the booze for Fabiano. - Please! - Please my ass! You have to learn there's no children here! Do you think I'm a comedian? - Or an actor? - Now he's an actor... Actor my ass! If you continue to talk like that, I'll have to ask you to leave. Please. I won't even ask you. So, please. Get out. Leave me here with my Corinthians. My life is here. It's so clean! It smells like softener. Come on, Corinthians. Piti! Hey, bro. Are you ok? Hey, here. The mayor, the judge, the prosecutor, the priest, the lawyer… all the staff at the school, at the forum, at the hospital, all from the same family. It passes from generation to generation. Their names are all there. They’re written on the signs. So why should I study? I won’t study anything. Here nobody studied and they’re all doctors and engineers. I preferred to go fishing... fishing, hunting... learning to swim. Here’s the deal. I think I'm going to study now. Yeah, I’ll study now. The school of the future. Because working... swimming... playing ball... In fact, I've done all the good things in life. And the bad things as well. I just won’t talk about it, of course. But it's ok. I’m forgiven. At least I didn’t kill anyone and I didn’t die. And when they tried to kill me, I would say, "Okay. Since you're armed, I'm not going to die today.” And that's it. And the funny thing is I'm alive, I didn’t die. The guys kept thinking, "What's this guy talking about? We’re the ones with the guns, how does he know he won’t die?” I don't know. I guess I didn’t know, but I had to improvise. Because I wouldn’t die in silence. I think they thought again and... Words are powerful. Right? Ask her to call me Tell her that despite everything I haven't changed. I have called her a million times And she tells them to say that she's not home Tell her you saw me crying You can use the justification you prefer Try everything you can Ask her to get back to me Tell her that now I am Lonely without love That you only looked for her Because you saw my pain Tell her that I'm alone And that I'll suffer My pride is gone My life has changed I can't handle it Ask her to call me The longing is killing me It's bad Ask her to call me I no longer can live like this. Listen to me Mara. You are not at your home, you are at the drug den. Then what? I'm going there to pick you up, ok? I'm going to pick you up now, is that ok? Ok! I'm gonna take a shower and change. Can I go there? Ok then my love. Ok, my love, that's what I'm telling you. Ok. Ok, my love. Hold your head up, honey. And take your feet off my wall, you're getting it dirty. That's how I am. What can I do? I'm horrible... - I'm demanding, right? - Demanding. Things have turned around. Answer my question. Why have you... Did you fall in love with me? Give me a hug? - Give me a hug! - I will! No, take your hat off! My hair is messy, with no gel. Wow, did you put my spine in place? Oh, boy. You know what? Everything around me is saved... but few can save me. Go in there. Don't hit me, you have to be gentle. - What's up, brother? - Brother? My marriage is over because of you. I'll fucking break your head. Come on! I'm not scared of you. - Come on, then! - I'll beat you down! What is it? Fabiano! Fabiano! Fabiano! Fabiano! Stop it! What do you want from me you son of a bitch? What was that, Cris? Wait. Hi. There's a person unconscious due to a fight. Hello? There are people waiting with two knives. He keeps saying he's going to cut people. Bro, a closed mouth catches no flies. He keeps saying he'll cut me up. So what? Bro, I know you're right, they have a lot of issues. I'm totally right. - Fabiano... - He had an iron bar. The girl saw it. He was provoking. The crew girl saw it. Ask her. Stop protecting the wrong things in here. You protect the wrong things in here! I protect him just like I protect you. You don’t need to protect me because I'm in the right. Man, nobody's right, nobody's wrong! I am right! Tell me I’m wrong here! Tell me what I'm doing wrong! No one is just right, no one is just wrong. But I am right. I don’t do anything to harm anyone in here. Right? What about this, bro? He’s got blood on his head... So what? He deserves more. Why did he have an iron bar in his hand? You’re acting just like a cop! I'm not a cop, I'm a criminal. You're the cops. - I'm a cop? - I don’t know. I just know you protect the wrong guys. I protect you just the same... Then move the guy upstairs again... Is that what you want? Move him upstairs! What's going on? Now there'll be a lot of people wishing to buy it. Who wouldn't want a TV with a DVD player? - Do you want it? - I have no money. I have no cash now. Chokito... Excuse me. Give me some liquor, buddy? Give her some alcohol. - They're filming. - No, I want sugarcane liquor. - The liquor is there. - She wants that one. Let me see. It's the other bottle. - Let me see. - I got it. Not that one. That's water. - Where's the other one? - Right here. - No... - She wants sugarcane liquor. - That's vodka. - No. I'm not in a good day today. I just don't want you bugging me. But that's ok. Pour me some, please. Just a little bit. Now I remembered Mr. Fernando. Where's Fernando, Andrea? - Help us! - Where is Fernando? Is he hiding on the bathroom again? You're kidding. Where's Fernando? - Where's Fernando? - Where's Fernando? You help him, but you don't help me. I help everyone and no one helps me. - You never asked for my help. - I need some help. And what kind of help do you want, honey? - I need help. - What's your problem? Let me see if I can help you. One thousand bucks. That's what I need. I'm a doe, I can't help you with bucks. Lend me 500 reais. - Do you think I have that? - It wouldn't solve anything. It may not solve things, but it can help us. I want to eat our food. I'll eat later. So you're going to be hungry. Too many people in my place. Today is Friday and there is a good samba. There's a samba in Santa Cecilia. - Let’s go? - No. Hi. Come on. It's packed in here. - I’ll come by later. - Ok! - Hit the button, honey. - You do it. I just got home. I'm tired. I'll take a shower. - Sup, bro? - Sup, Corinthians? - This is a diehard fan! - Fanatic. Passionate! I'll take a shower and rest. It starts all over again tomorrow. I haven't told you, but I used to be married to a man. You were? Yes, and happily married. He passed. Because of the booze. He used to drink too much! When he got home, he wanted to fight and break things. You know that booze only brings bad things, right? Just like drugs. When you use drugs... God forbid! I don't even like to talk about it. He was always fighting, mom. I mean, honey. And didn't you hit him? What? I used to beat him silly! Once I made him pass out, “Wake up, for the love of God!" Fear of going to jail. Are you crazy? He passed out. He hit my head so hard against the wall. I hit him so hard, that he passed out. But do you have a ring and everything? I threw it out, love. Did you drop his last name already? I threw out the ring. But did you drop your married name? Marriage? Why don’t you do it? No, I threw it away. I left it for his relatives. Get out. I left everything for his relatives. It was a big party. But did you get properly married? I did, but I left everything for his relatives. But you have to drop your married name, you know? The man was retired... To take what's his? No way, I left everything there. - But you... - Listen. One thing I don't feel is greed. I don't feel greed. He had that because he worked, he struggled. I only want what's mine by the sweat of my brow. I'm asking if you drop his name off the papers. I did, but I left everything there. But are you free now? I left everything there. Any children? Beautiful children. Where are they? They’re with his family. I left everything there. I didn’t even think about going after that. I left it with the family. - Any girls too? - Boys. All boys? How many? About ten. You have a lot of kids! You fucked a lot! What can I do? I've already used that metaphor. Now! Your house by the beach. Great opportunity. Not far from the city. All the facilities you need and of course beautiful beaches. Look at your house! Two bedrooms, one bathtub, living room, american kitchen, open backyard. All of this at 3020-1070. Got it? Call us now! Tonight, 7:30pm. Love will win over prejudice. "Mother Slave" Open for me. It's me. Open up, please. I want to talk to you. Let me talk to you. Open up for me, Cris. Can you hear me? Cris? Can you hear me? Open up for me. She's alone. She's breaking everything. Cris, it's Éder. Open up so we can talk. She's a slut! What happened? What is all that blood? Did you cut your hand? Let me see. Where did all this blood come from? Where did it come from? Where did you get hurt? Is it your finger? Go get me some toilet paper. Cris, you can not do such a thing to yourself. There's a lot of blood. - Do you have something to clean her up, Eder? - No, let's wash her hand. Come over. The elevator is out of order. Careful with the steps. I'm all tore up. I've shown you. And you're saying that I beat her. We haven't said anything, we want to hear you. We haven't said anything, we're hearing you, Ronaldo. - What was that? Knife? - Cut. I'm the one who's wrong, I'm no good. And I'm picking aluminum cans like a fool every day. I have no father. We're not saying you're wrong. Let me speak, please. I lost my father, bro. My mom, forgive my language, is a real bitch. She sold my sister. I'm living in hell. My wife cheated on me with my robbing partner, right bro? I don't even blink, bro. Ronaldo, Ronaldo, look at me. I feel persecuted. Is it because of my skin? Or is it because I'm a screw up? You two are fighting a lot. But why? Pay attention. Listen to me. - Are you a psychologist? - No, I'm a pharmacist. A pharmacist? Then pay attention. Put together a vodka and a sugarcane liquor here. She drinks both. Medicine, she takes them. And if you place a crack rock, she transforms herself. "This is my pipe, give it to me!" May I ask you a question, Ronaldo? And you think I'm lying. No, we don't. I want to hear your version. I'm being totally discriminated against. - Who's doing that? - I said that today. Let me ask you. Don't you like her? Love is love. What about taking care of her when she's high? - Should I let her kill me? - I'm asking a question. - I'll die, look! - I know, it's awful. I'm asking you a question. Look at this! Look at this! Come on! Don't get me wrong... Excuse me, I don't need no boss. Come on, raise your voice. What was that song? If I want to smoke, I smoke If I want to drink, I drink I pay for everything I consume with the sweat of my labor I don't look for trouble, but I don't run from them either One day I'll straighten up because I have faith in what I hold dear I can only cuddle with whom caresses me Like the vampire and the bat, it's the man and the woman My language is clear, I'm not speaking Greek I have real lovers and friends in the places I go I'm feeling relaxed, it's not as if I've been drinking Nor smoked to talk about people's lives But I can honestly say the ugliest thing in life it's people who complain for no reason It's people who complain for no reason You'll stand there for a while. This takes time. Don’t you like funk music, love? All this love that you have, I want you just for myself I think I'll be an MC, what do you think? - What? - An MC. MC, honey. I want to be an MC. But do you think I'm going to be rich? If I become rich one day, you're going to come with me. I won’t forget you. We're going to make lots of money. It's even dangerous to make lots of money. Don’t you want me to be rich? No! - Why not? - I don’t want it. Should I spend my life pulling a wagon like an ox? - No. - I have to change this, dammit. You can, but be careful with the women, ok? Because you never know... And I should make money. Just be careful with the women, ok? You know, right? You know... What is this dance like? What do you do with your hand? Or you want me to become a thief, a dealer... - You’re not crazy. - Is that what you want? You want me to work at the den? I want to decide what I want. God forbid me. So that's it. God forgive me, I want to be an MC... MC... MC Benedita. How are you, my love? What happened? Why that voice? You sound so gloomy. What did you say? Really? You're better off on your own? Really? That's cool. Cool. I'm not worth anything to anyone. People are only worth when they're standing up. It's true. Yes, my life. You don't give a fuck about my human being. You don't care if I'm well, if I'm alive or not. Yes, it's true. You only care about... you know what. So why don't you say it straight, instead of giving me hope? Say it straight away, and break up with me. So is it really over? Is that it? If I see you at the drug den, I'll kill you right there! You'll see! You'll see, Mara! No one messes with this son of a bitch! You toy with my feelings. Do you think I'm afraid of your family? You play with my heart. You're cruel to me, Mara! You don't know how much I love you! You're too cruel to me! I'm the kind of person with whom you lived for so many years. See how much love I give you? Surrender yourself, body and soul, Mara! You'll see how happy we'll be. The day you did and we went to our little shack, we had wonderful moments! Damn it, why don't you? I'll change, I'll do anything you want, but, for the love of God, give me love! Give me attention! I beg for affection and love! I'm tired of living like this! For the love of God, Mara, I love you! Mara, don't do that! Don't make me suffer like that! I'm tired of suffering. I want you, I want to marry you! You'll see the crazy things I'll do for your love! So you believe that I love you! Mara... Mara... Mara, it's no use if I do crazy things for your love and you don't give it back. That's what's hard, because when I was getting love back you could see everything was working out. I would cater to your every whim. Take this, take this! I had willpower to go after things. Now I have willpower to go after smoke. Do you know why? To forget that I'm alone. That's what's hard. I was with you, but it was like being with a ghost. Hang it up. You see? I didn't get your love and affection. Got it, love? Think about it, ok? Send my love to the kids. Good bye. Thank you. You're awesome. Don't suffer, ok? That's cool. You were really true. - You showed... - Too bad you're married. Let me go. Where are you going? I'll do other things. Bye-bye. That's ok. If that's what life has in store for me... But I love Mara. A thousand women may kiss me, whatever... I don't care. I want Mara! Now I know That the love you promised me Was not the same love that you gave to me What you swore were a lie But that's ok I learned that you can't believe Everything someone tells us In a moment of pleasure Or of love But that's ok I know that the days come and go You shall find someone one day That will do to you what you have done to me And then During hard times I know you'll look for me With that sweet talk that made me fall in love For someone with false feelings And then You'll realize that I'm cool That I had no one for a while But some things in life are blessings in disguise But some things in life are blessings in disguise Do you love me? - What? - You love me, I love you. What is that song? - What? - You told me you'd buy it for me. What song? That song you told me you'd buy for me. Tell me what song it is. I don't remember the name. When we go there, I'll show it to you. I said, "Love, I want this." You told me you'd buy it for me. - Buy what? - I'll know once we go there. - Racionais? - I think it's something else. Racionais? Funk? I'm sick and tired of funk. It's something like that. I'll stop listening to funk, and I'll preach the love of God. Didn't you say you were going to sing and dance? I know, love, but it's a devil's thing. I like good things. I'll stop with funk. We can go to church to see if we can cure your head. Don't mess with me! I want to help you. You don't want it? Are you catholic? – I can see. – What? – Why? – To go to church. I won't go. – Haven't you got out yet? – We're taking a spin. I almost got hurt here once. Where are you going? No, I should go up first. Are you ok? Your hair is messy. Loosen up your hair. And you too. Excuse me, let me see mine. My hair is messy too. Excuse me. - Are you going up or down? - I don’t know. The elevator was here, I came for a ride. I have to press my floor. Not yours! Why didn’t you press it before? I've been meaning to ask you a favor... I don’t have it. What now? We're on the first floor. - Is this the first? - You're riding too? Nice. We're taking a spin. Why did you press the third floor again? Talita, don't stress me up. He's always on WhatsApp. There's room for one more. Are you going up? If you are, I'll go too. There's no room for you, Fabiano. It's better if Cabelo leaves. Let Piti here. Sir, you're taking space. What does this do? I went up today with an umbrella. Sorriso was in the car with no umbrella. - And it's raining. - He put on a jacket... You're not Piti, get off. What floor is this? This is the third. It's not this one. Piti, get out. Get out or it won't close. You're going to get your nose caught in the door. I'll go to the fifth. I know you are, the fifth gate of hell. No, the fifth floor. Turn this thing off, have some manners. - You're a stud, Fabiano. - God forbid me! - What floor is this? - Come, Piti. Fabiano is a stud! Are you staying? - Let her stay there. - Go, Pebbles. Pebbles is mean. We have an important issue and we need your help. Here's the thing, we need to welcome three families with many children, and the boys said you and Maria Aparecida... I won't leave the room. If that's what you're saying, don't even bother. - Fabiano, we need. - But I won't leave the room. I won't leave, that's it. - It's not like that. - Of course it is. Me and Maria are fine now. The idea is not to separate you. We would just transfer you and her to another room. No, I want that room. When I arrived here, I received a room to myself. Everything was fine, then they moved a guy to a room next to mine and I didn't have a break after that. The guy destroyed everything, so I had to move to this other room. I do the right things, I don't steal here, I don't break anything, I help around. I try to do my best. I'm even injured because I confront things. No one confronts anything. People are stealing and you overlook and say it's fine. Fine my ass! They'll steal and destroy even more. That's what happens. I'm not better than anyone, but the day the kitchen was set up I told them to lock things up. In one week everything was gone. They put a microwave, and now it's gone. Whose loss is it? Yours or ours? You know? It's hard, it's hard. I don't know, that's my view. Fabiano, for the sake of six people, with four children. - There are many rooms there. - There are no rooms! - The problem is the space. - Find another one. - I'm fine and I won't leave. - Not even temporally? - That's non-negotiable? - Non-negotiable. No deals are kept here. It's non-negotiable. Will you at least think about it, Fabiano? Ok, I'll think about it. It's not like that! You're wrong, Fernando. - Do you want to be radical, ok? - You got it. I'm gonna kick some ass! You're not going to do that because you're wrong. Yes, you're wrong. You're trying to convey that you're right. You're wrong. - I wanted to talk to you, but... - No! You don’t. I want to talk regardless of the camera. So you don’t want what I want? I'm not coerced and I have nothing to hide. So, what is it? What do you want to say? You want to smoke crack? What is it? You're either with or without me. What are you looking at? What are you looking at? Didn’t you hit me once, so what will it be, honey? Aren’t you going to be with me? - Not like this. - So go your own way. No. He said he wanted to be with me and now he walks away. Love... - Look at me. - If you want to do that, stand up. I'm sitting down. If you want, talk to me. Don’t turn your back on me. Sit here! Geez. I'm not going there. You’re mean to me. What? I'm not the mean one. Sit here with me then. Come! Tell me what you want to say. What do you get acting like that? - You! - What do you get? You, not me. Stubborn. Say, “Benedita, how are you? Are you okay?" "Are you alive?” Yeah right... Who? Yeah right... Sure. Look at how mad she is. You know I love you, right? You know it. You're grounded now. I told you. What? What did you say? I love you. - Kiss me. - No! You don’t even want to kiss me today. I brushed my teeth, it’s not smelling of crack. - Kiss me. - God forbid me. - It’s not smelling of crack. - God forbid me. No way! Not a chance. No way. - What do I do with this woman? - Not a chance. The new "My Lily" was born from Narcisu's petals. When you buy any of our perfumes, you could win a trip to France every week. Believe in beauty. Hi, guys... That's it. I don't have many ideas today. Actually, today I'm... I have a headache. I'm serious. My mood is a little sad. That's it. So many things to do, and I haven't done anything. I don't feel it's a holiday. November 2nd. And the worst thing... is that I don't even know if my father has died. Yes, I could call him, right? I don't know why but I don't remember. I remember, then I forget. When I remember, I'm high, and I put the blame on something. On someone or on something. I always walk away from it. But life is not quite like that. The day of the living, not of the dead. That's why it's good to think about the briefness of life. It passes by fast. Really fast. I don't have where to shower. My stuff are in her room. I have no soap, no cream. I only have these clothes. She doesn't help me. I buy things for us... She attacks me. I'm very down. I just can't stop. If I depended on the social project... She depends on the project for her things, R$ 130,00 once a week. Every day I have money, every day I help her. I buy things for us to eat. And that's how she treats me? I don't know why. When we're sober, it's one thing, when we start using drugs, she changes completely. She says I'm looking at other women, that I'm hitting on I don't know who. I don't care for anyone else, I only care for her. She's crazy. I'm no player to hit on any woman. I'm with her! I'll wait, I haven't seen her today. I won't even knock on her door. Appropriate for a family girl. Dad, I'm no longer a little girl. You are. For God's sake. Don't you understand? I want to be a normal 20 year-old girl like all the others. Don't you see I can't stand working at that bakery? That's it, grandma. I don't say anything, but no one sees me, no one notices me, no one realizes I'm there. No one even knows I exist! She's just like me. In that bakery, I'm like yesterday's bread. No, not that. I won't admit being treated like a child. Like someone unimportant. My mom understands me. Yes, grandma, only my mom. But she's not here anymore. And this is your fault! Hi. Who's there? Is Rita home? She left? It's her wife. I bought her medicine, but she doesn't come here to pick it up. Tell her… Tell her it's Benedita, she knows who I am. I think she'll be here tomorrow if I send her a message. She's not at home. She left. She's not coming here. It's late. Right? I should've told her to come tomorrow morning. Now it's too late. I didn't think of that. I didn't think... I won't even turn on the music. Merry Christmas, Dad! Merry Christmas, family! I'm sorry for not being able to be with you. But my feelings will always be with you. Merry Christmas. Not that one, or I'll be the one crying. My goodness... Black music here! You just can't cry. Listen... Fernando, listen... I'll take it off. It's better. I'll be gone, Eduardo. I'll be out for a few days. I'll go to my mom's. The atmosphere is tense. I'd better leave to avoid many things. Come on, Fernando! It's depressive. No, no! Only depressive songs. Look! Look what a man in love looks like. Hi, did Rita arrive, please? Did my wife, Rita, arrive? She came by, but I wasn't here. Dear God! That wretched! Close that damn door, please. Please, answer me. Man, this is so... I'm so... This shit hurts. It's not a simple pain. It's a pain that hurts. It hurts, man. It hurts in my chest. I feel like I'm about to have a heart attack. This is caring. My feelings for her are all true. All of them... It's all real. I'm a crazy guy. I'm totally crazy. Those who look at me don't have a clue. "He's hassling." I'm crazy, man. I don't depend on anyone. I don't depend on anyone. I'm down in the dumps now. The worst moment of my life. But I don't depend on anyone. I hustle, and I struggle. "Oh, you're so quiet." I'm not quiet, Andrea! I'm not quiet. "You do that sorry face!" Do I have a sorry face? I look like I suffer. I suffer, but I want to get ahead in life. I want to grab a load of cash to spend on her, my mom and my dad. I'll make it big one day. Wait! Wait! I've made it big several times. I've had the opportunity to be well-off! Take it easy. I'll make it big. These things have their own time. This is a sad story that happened to me I fought with my girl and she won't see me again Life has no value for me anymore I lost you, girl, and you used to be my love I try to reflect and reminisce the past Remembering the moments that caused an impression on me I know that it all started before I knew it I confess that I can't live without you Walking on the beach, next to each other Exchanging glances and passionate kisses Kisses of madness, kisses of pleasure Passion raves, feelings of power Body of a girl, mind of a woman Our love is ready for whatever may come Other moments like this will never repeat Because I was born for you and you were born for me For 20 months, Parque Dom Pedro Hotel housed 107 people through a municipal damage reduction program. During the shooting, that took place between August 2016 and January 2017, the life of the residents was shaken by the election of a new mayor that was against the program. Short time after, the hotel was closed. Most of its residents were back on the streets.
