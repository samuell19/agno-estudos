[Chuckles] Why do you have to be so mean? Hey, I'm your older brother. Being mean and heartless is part of my job. [Laughing] They're going to get you, little sister. Johnnie, now you're being silly and I don't want to hear it. Will you cut it out, right now? [ Barbara] You never know when to stop, do you? Never! [Johnnie Snickering] What's the matter, Barbara? You getting' scared? You're still scared of her, aren't you? [Scoffs That's why we're here, isn't it? No, that's not why we're here. Tell me something', will ya? Why do we have to put ourselves through this... charade? Because she is our mother! Can't you at least give her one day out of your life? One day? This is the fourth time we've been up here... in the three months since she died. I'm spending more time with her now than when she was alive. And you know why? Don't start. She couldn't possibly be buried in the city. No. That would have been much too easy. She knew I'd have to be the one to drive you up here. That's why she had herself buried 200 miles from the nearest glass of beer. Johnnie, now we're here. Will you just please stop it? Stop what? The truth? She drove our father to an early grave. She drove me away from home, and she damned near drove you into a convent. That's not true. When's the last time you had a date? That is none of your business! The one thing she never, ever drove... was 200 miles to visit anything. Johnnie, please. Now, I need you to stop talking like that. Don't talk like that. Not here. What do you mean, “not here”? Not here. Not in the middle of- Of what? Show some respect. Ha! You're afraid, aren't you? You really are afraid of this place. God, you never stop! [Sinister Laughing] For the love of God,Johnnie. Bastard! Jesus, you're weird. Let's just get through this, can we, please? Just get it over with. They're coming to get you, Barbara. [Car Door Slams] - Barbara- - For the love of God,Johnnie. They're horny, Barbara. They've been dead a long time. Look! Look! There's one of them now. He wants you! [Chuckles] He's getting closer. Dangerously closer! [ Laughing] Stop it john! He's going to hear you! It doesn't matter. He knows we're here. It's too late now. There's no escape! [Screams] No, Mother! - You bastard. - [ Chuckling] [Grunts] [ Screams, Gasps] Johnnie- I'm sorry. Very sorry. [Johnnie] Hey! I'm sorry. Hey, man, are you okay? Is there something we can do to help?

Goddamn all of you! Truck's on empty. We can't take the chance of running dry out in the middle of nowhere. We'll hole up here. Hope that some help comes. My name is Ben. What's your name? - Barbara. - Barbara. - Yes. - Now look here, Barbara. I don't need you falling apart on me. You understand? I see what you did over there. I know you can fight when you have to. Well, you have to now. Right now. Fight what you're thinking'. Fight what you're feeling'. The fight'll keep you strong, keep you thinking' straight. What's happening? I don't know. Nobody knows. Radio in the truck. All I heard was trash talk. Same as always. People trying' to sound like they know what's going' on. They don't really know shit! Same as always. One guy saying it's... escaped prisoners on the loose from up at Hennessey. Another guy saying it's... some kind of chemical spill making' everybody go crazy. They don't know shit. How do they explain... a man walking' around with his neck broken? A man shot full of holes... and still coming' at you? Assholes... down in Evans City out for a good time... with their guns and their six-packs. Assholes trying' to round them up and put them in the back of trucks. Like they know what they going to do with them. They had 10, 20 of them in the back of this panel truck. They opened the door to let another one in. They come spilling' out of there... like bugs. [Sighs] [Grunting] I was at a diner. Windows shot out. Lady next to me shot dead. Others too. I saw six or seven go down. Car exploded outside. My car caught on fire. It was like- like a war. Some of those things made it inside the diner. Started comm' after us. [Chuckles] Some good old' boy comes chasing' him. Mean son of a bitch got some kind of... hot-shit gun, like an M-16 or something'. He starts- [imitates Gunfire] shooting wild. Bullets tearin' up the place. I saw one of those things take 30 hits and keep on comin'. The damn thing had to be dead, but it kept on comin'... till it took a hit in the head. That brought it down. The only way to stop 'em- You got to- You got to... get 'em in the head. Look, I don't know what's goin' on, but I sure as hell know that it ain't no prison break. It ain't no kind of chemical that I ever heard about can make a dead man walk. This is something that nobody has ever heard about and nobody's ever seen before. This is hell on earth. This is pure hell on earth. [Frog Croaking] [High-Pitched Whining] Damn! Doesn't take long for the world to fall apart, does it? There's got to be guns in this house. Maybe upstairs. I'm going to go take a look around. You all right down here alone? There's something up there. What? [ Barbara] What is it? It's all right. It's nothin' to worry about. - What is it? - It's nothin'. It's nothin'. it's all right. [ Footsteps ] [ Door Creaks] [Screams] Ben! [Groaning] - [Gun Cocks] - it's all right. Don't shoot. Don't shoot, mister! - It's just us! - Who the hell is “us”? - Tom Bitner, sir. That's me. [Woman] Harry, what's going on? This here's Harry Cooper. That's his wife callin' down in the cellar. They got a sick little girl down there too. My woman's down there too, that's Judy Rose Larson. Um, that's all of us. Do you mind if we ask who the hell you are now? - Girl's Barbara. I'm Ben. - You damned near broke my arm, Mr. Ben. Harry, for God's sake! - Aren't you going to answer her? - Harry, please answer me! Uh, it's all right. We're all right. - There's some people up here. - Didn't you hear all the noise up here? - We could've used some help. - Hey, maybe you can see through walls. I can't. We heard some bangin' around up here. It could've been those things for all we could tell. Wejust heard some bangin' around is all. No, no, that ain't right. We heard the girl callin' out, askin' if anyone was here. We was just scared, that's all. Want to know the truth? We was scared to hell. You live here, Tom? No. This is my Uncle Rege's house. Him and my cousin Satchel. OI' Uncle Rege, he's dead. I seen him. I swear to God. I touched him. He was stone cold dead. He died today. - And that's the truth! - [Woman] Harry, please! Let's go. We can talk in the cellar. Me and Judy Rose, we walked on over to be with Satchel, you know? Radio said there was some kind of trouble. We didn't see nothin'. We didn't see nothin'. Home to here, we didn't see nothin'. Damn it! We have heard all this before! I didn't hear it before, Cooper. Go on, Tom. Well, me and Judy Rose, we walked on over like we said. We wasn't here more than 1 O minutes when Mr. Cooper there, he come bangin' on the door. How'd you get here? You don't look like neighbors. Oh, what? You tryin' to figure out if somebody's got a car? You don't think we've all been through this before? Mine is broken down on the interstate, and the kid here doesn't own one, if you can believe that. Damn! What about you, Mr. Ben? You don't exactly look like neighbors yourself. Truck- outside, out of gas. Gas? Evans City is five miles away. Hey, we can make five miles on freakin' fumes! Yeah, what if we don't make it? You willin' to take that chance? Besides, Evans City's a war zone, man. I know. I been there. It's going to take us a hell of a lot more than five miles before we find any real help. There's a gas pump out by the shed. Huh? But Uncle Rege, he keeps it locked. Do you know where the key is? No, but I could hunt for it. We will, but not now. It could take too long. Besides, we might never find it. We got to figure out what we're doin' first! - Finish your story, Tom. - This is bullshit. If we're going to do something, let's do it. If we're going to stand around and bullshit, let's do it in the cellar... where it's safe. I'm not so sure goin' down in that cellar is a smart move. What do you mean? I mean I'm not so sure... lockin' ourselves down in that cellar is such a smart move! I'm not goin' down there until I know what all the options are. What damned options? And who the fuck gave you the right to decide for the rest of us? I'm not deciding for you or anybody else, Cooper. I'm thinkin' about my own ass! Now, you want to go down in that cellar, go! Nobody's stoppin' you. For God sakes, Harry, what's going on? Damn it, Helen! Will you quit yelling at me? I can't think straight with you yelling at me! You know, I've only been around you a minute or two, but that's enough time for me to know that I don't like you. I'm sure you feel the same about me, so let’s just... try to stay out of each other's way, all right? Go on, Tom. What else you got to tell? Well, like I said, Judy Rose and I, we wasn't here more than 10 minutes, and... Mr. Cooper, he come bangin' on the door, you know. We let him in, him and his wife, and I seen their little girl was hurt, so I, uh- I tried to call for help, you know. The phone's makin' this funny sound. Tried and tried, and I couldn't call nobody. That's when Uncle Rege, uh, he come walkin' out of the bedroom, you know? He was dead a minute before. I swear to God. He was not dead. He couldn't have been. Y-You were wrong. You made a mistake. That's all. He was dead. I know he was. What happened? Uncle Rege, he went after my cousin Satchel. H-He- He went after him like, uh- I don't know. Anybody else in the house? No,just them. Tom, I'm afraid your cousin is dead. Uh-huh. I know he's dead. Shot himself. I mean, Uncle Rege comin' after him and all, you know? I run down here and got the shotgun, but what could I do? I couldn't imagine shootin' Uncle Rege. Couldn't imagine doin' a thing like that. And that's when I told everyone to go down in the cellar. Goin' down in the cellar, that's my idea. - It was a good idea. - Look. Look outside. - Into the cellar, quick. - No, that cellar's a death trap. Those things don't have much strength, but get enough together. they may be able to break through the door. Be cornered down there. No way out. We'd do better fightin' 'em off here where there's still some way to escape. A way out is a way in. T-The windows- Maybe we can board 'em up. There's no time. Those things are- Look, there's only three of them, man. I've handled more than that by myself. We found these two guns. I'm worried about more of 'em comin'. That cellar door won't hold 'em. - Oh, and the windows will. - Look, I don't need this! I told you before, you want to go downstairs, go on. Get! You can be boss down there. I'm boss up here. What you going to do, Tom? [Chuckles] Judy Rose, come on up. We need your help. You're crazy! You're out of your minds. This here'sjudy Rose. Go get them old shelves out of the kitchen. What are we doin' now? We're going to board up them windows. Tommy! Board up the windows? Are you sure we're going to be all right? There are more of them things out there. More of them things like Uncle Rege. Tommy! Go on. Do what I tell ya! I shut this door, I'm not openin' it until somebody comes who can get us out of here. [ Scoffs ] If somebody like that comes, we'll try to remember to call you. Idiots! You lamebrains! You're going to die up here. You're going to die. [Chattering] [Hammering] [Woman] You're going to be fine. We're all going to be fine. Daddy's found someone, and we're going to get some help. What's happening? They decided to stay upstairs. What about us? it's safer down here. - What about Sarah? - It's safer down here, Helen. [Sighs] [ Ben ] There's just that one hammer. Here. Use this. Nail 'em up quick and dirty. Get the windows covered as fast as you can. We'll go around later and reinforce them. Anybody find any keys, hang on to 'em. How many people are up there? There's two more. - And they've got the gun. - No, they've got two guns. They might have a hundred guns, for all I know. But it doesn't matter, because it's safer down here! We're going up. We've got to get help for Sarah. I'm not opening that door, Helen, and neither are you. And if you try, so help me I'll kill you. You'll what? That is your daughter lying there. We have got to get her to a doctor! There's no doctors upstairs, Helen. And there's no way out of here! None of those yo-yos has a car! [Grunts] What a place to be stuck! Middle of nowhere. Bunch of yo-yos. [Tom] Judy Rose, help me here! That's it. Grab this. Perfect. Fever's gotten worse. Look, she's going to be all right. Somebody'll come. We'll get out of here. We're all going to be all right. [Hammering] [Ben] Did you find anything? I'm done over here. They're crazy. They're out of their minds. You bunch of yo-yos! This is the last of the big stuff, huh? Not going to do it. Hey, Tom, give me a hand. Turn it over. Come on. Come on. Get the legs off. Shit! [Grunts] All right. We'll leave our gun here. I'll be back. Come on, come on, come on! [Grunts] Get over here. Okay, great. Bring my gun when you come back. Come on. Nail it up. Just get it up. We'll reinforce it later. They're so slow! We could just walk right past 'em. We wouldn't even have to run. We could just walk right past 'em. [Hammering Continues] We have the guns. If we're careful, we can get away. You told me to fight. Well, I'm fighting. I'm not panicking. This place is not safe, not upstairs or down. We should leave before it's too late. Look, I know you want to get out of here, and so do I, and we're going to do it. We're going to figure out a way to get to that gas, and we'll be gone. Now, you're doin' fine, all right? I'm doin' fine. We're all doin'just fine. We're going to make it, if we're careful. Like you said, we've got to be careful. Get them doors down and nail 'em up! That's it! Nice goin'! Is she crazy or what? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Tommy! Easy- Easy. [Pounding] [Judy Rose Screaming] Wait for Torn. Wait. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. All right. Nail it up. Nail it up! Come on. Come on. [Whimpering] Just get a few nails in. Okay.

Keep pounding. Get a hole for that one. Come on, Tom. Tom! Oh, yeah, another door. Let's get this baby off. [whimpering] That's good. [Hammering Continues] Easy, easy, easy. All right. [Moaning] Hit it. Come on! Hey, we're goin' upstairs for a minute. We're going to leave the weapons here, all right? [Hammering Continues] Hey, hey, Tom. Tom. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't go up. It's all right. Come on. Don't look at it. What is this? All new stuff in here? Uncle Rege was fixin' up the place. - No good. - it's better than nothin', Ben. No good.

[Coughs] [Squeaking] [Screaming] [ Man Over Radio] Do not attempt to reach friends or family. Do not attempt to reach any of the rescue stations... identified in previous advisories. They may no longer be in operation. Repeating this advisory number nine from the Office of Emergency Preparedness... dated 11:00 p.m. August 23, 1989. It has been confirmed that the bodies of the dead... are being reactivated by forces as yet unknown. [Chuckling] Got that right. [Man On Radio] These reactivated bodies are weak and uncoordinated, but are capable of inflicting damage on people and on property. They are to be considered extremely dangerous, especially when encountered in large numbers. These bodies can be disposed of in only one known manner- that is by incapacitating the brain. [ Chuckling] They got that right too. These reactivated bodies... will attack warm-blooded animals of all species, including human beings, without provocation, and will devour flesh of any prey. [Laughing] ltis' been confirmed that acts of homicide and cannibalism... reported through the afZe/'noon and evening... [Continues Laughing] of August 23, 1989... are attributable, at least in part, to these reactivated bodies. [ Radio Continues, indistinct] [Gun Cocks, Shot Fires] [Gasps] Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
