A man goes into a bakery and asks for bread. "Black or white?" asks the baker. "It doesn't matter," says the man. "It's for a blind person." A guy wants to buy a horse. The horse dealer asks him, "What kind of horse do you want?" "Doesn't matter!" he answers. "Just long enough for eight of us." I know one, too. An elephant meets a little mouse. The elephant says to the mouse, "How small you are!" The mouse replies, "I've been ill for three weeks." "How far is it to America, Mom?" "Shut up, my boy, and keep swimming!" As a man murders his wife, her eyes pop out of her head. The guy says to her, "Can't believe your eyes, eh?" - Isn't that funny? - Yes... WHY DOES HERR R. RUN AMOK? I had an accident today. So I saw. It was so stupid. - This guy drove into me from the front! - How do you mean? - Yes. - He drove into your hood? He braked so sharply, for no reason at all. And I... It wasn't my fault. - Was anyone else in the car? - No, I was alone. - Two hours ago. - Were you being careless? No, I couldn't help it. I know I was partly to blame last time. But he simply braked too sharply. - You're feeling a bit nervous, eh? - Yes. Of course. It won't cost more than 20 or 24 marks. It'll be more. 91 marks 30 or something like that. As much as that? And that's without the labour. You can fix it, though, can't you? - Yes, but only at the weekend. - Yes. Okay. Are you mad at me? By the way, Hanna is visiting us. - Which Hanna? - My old school friend. Oh, your old friend. She's waiting for us in the apartment. What do you plan to do? Go for a stroll, I suppose. She doesn't know Munich very well. I'd like to buy myself a skirt. Sure. But I won't come with you. I'll stay at home. Why? I'm feeling overworked. Was it bad? Did you have a hard day? What happened? Well, you know. Trouble? Was it your fault? No, just the general atmosphere. What does that mean? Hard to explain! Certain things... Is there talk of promotion? I'm not going to any more parties. Why not? I'm sick of them. Everybody just sits around... All those matrons showing photos of their kids. Just to prove they have something. When did you last go? Last Christmas. What do you have against them? Nothing! It just bores me. You think we're like that, too? No, I don't think so. We lead a very orderly sort of life, but I don't think we're stuffy middle class. But nor are we... What do you call the opposite? What a curious conversation! You think so? You're free, of course, Hanna. You can say what you like, and dress as you like. You have a nice hairdo, but... - Really? - Yes. A bit too much, maybe? My wife couldn't walk around like that, you see. We have certain obligations, close contacts with my boss. Maybe you don't understand, or don't want to. I understand you perfectly, but... I think your hairdo is great. - The question doesn't arise with us. - You couldn't run around like that. What do you mean? I like it, too. But she's probably independent. It's not interesting talking about us. I'd like to know what you do. - I was waiting for that. - I'm interested. Yes, what do I do? - What do you do? - Nothing really. Not bad. What else? And whatever else I feel like doing. That's even better. And then... I don't really know what I do. Well, if you can afford to. Sure! Otherwise... You're a step ahead of us. More independent. Now he's getting aggressive. I've never seen him like this. There's a stain on your lapel. - Where? - On the left. - Here? - Yes. It's not so bad. I don't know how anyone can say, "I don't know what I do." It's no joke any more, huh? Joke? You can joke about everything, I suppose. - Don't be so aggressive! - I'm not aggressive. I have to respond to what people say. I'm looking for a record. I heard it on the radio, but I've forgotten the title. It has a long introduction, full of feeling. And the lyrics are those of a young man singing of the girl who's left him. He says you shouldn't tell lies. In the middle, there are long instrumental passages and the chorus keeps coming in. Any idea what it could be? It was on the radio last Sunday evening. A pop music programme. The Hit Parade. I think that's what it's called. My wife and I really liked the song. I'd like to buy it to please her. Was it a male or female singer? Male, I think. It's hard to tell nowadays. And what kind of song? Funny? No, it's a very sad song, sung with lots of feeling and the singer sighs a lot. His voice goes over the top. Any idea what it could be? Could you show me something? If you'd care to have a look... One of Heintje's songs? No. I don't think so. He wasn't as young as that. Roberto? He sings foreign lyrics, doesn't he? Italian. No, it's not that. How about Freddy? - No... - You know his new song? No, it wasn't Freddy. My wife would have recognised him. Maybe... This is quite a hit. What's it called? Maybe it's that. Would you play it for me? No, that's not it. Not so much drive to it. The melody was slow, the music more tender. No, it's not that. The way people used to dance... When I met my wife, you used to dance close together. It was similar to that, maybe a foxtrot... Can you sing it? Sing it? Just a minute. The beginning, maybe. Then come the lyrics? Yes, immediately afterwards. Any idea what it might be? There's a drum roll. Roberto Blanco? It is a German song? Yes. With a bit of beat? Yes, but only slightly. Maybe this? It's new. Yes, that's it! You left out the beginning. I'll play it again. Yes. That's it! Do you remember that party at Willi's place? - When Willi left? - Yes. I don't like to think about it. You don't? I bet you don't! It was for Christian. For Christoph! Why do you always get confused? - There is no Christian. It was Chris. - There are two of them? No, his name's Christoph. Oh, it was Christoph back then? What do you mean "back then"? - The tall guy. - Yes. That was ages ago. It was Christoph. There is no "now". And all the time, I thought it was Christian. You've always mixed up those names ever since we've known each other. The tall, thin guy was called Christoph. Yes, and now please forget about Christoph! Why did you buy me this record? You did buy it for me, didn't you? - I like the record. - So do I. You remember the first time? We had gone dancing, I think. We often went dancing. I'm talking about the very first time. I remember it very well. It was the first time we ever went dancing. 10 or 15 of us. Toward the end of the evening, I said to you... - Remember? - Yes. Outside your door. But you didn't come in. You said your landlady didn't allow visitors. Well, you didn't come in? I was annoyed. Not any more, though? I just remember it so well. The way we kissed! What was so funny? I wanted to come in, but you said, "No, you can't. My landlady can be nasty." It really was impossible. It wasn't just an excuse. I believe you. Later on, I met your landlady. - I could understand it then. - Really? How long ago is it? Ages ago. You're a dear! How are things? I've heard about a promotion. No, not a promotion. Maybe a better position. After a raise things will improve. - A little bit. - He will get it. A little bit. Not much. Grandma's a bit stricter with him, eh? You can't always have coffee at my place, eh? - He doesn't drink much. - A little bit. Or would you prefer milk? Would you like some milk? Once in a while you can indulge yourself. We don't visit so often. A little of what you fancy! Let me have your cup! - Can I help? - No, no. Like some cake? - Do you have some? - Yes. Raspberry cake. - Did you make it yourself? - No. I'm not a very good baker. - Would you like a piece? - Yes. Just imagine... Sorry to interrupt! Last week I went to the theatre with Mrs. Rinbeck. - What did you see? - Othello. - Oh, lovely! - Yes, it was lovely. Is Mrs. Rinbeck keen on the theatre? Yes. I asked her if she'd like to go. So we went. We got all dressed up and off we went. What dress did you wear? The blue one with lace. After the show, we had a glass of wine. Did you go, Dad? No! - Why not? - That's nothing for him. - Do you like opera? - Yes, I do. Who was the director? No idea. You don't know? And who sang Othello? I'll bring the programme next time. Then you'll have a better idea. I've seen Othello. The overture was so loud! Yes, especially the last act! It's all serious in the end. I don't think you'd like it. You're too young and carefree. You don't want things like that. That's true. You'd want a bit of beat and dance. Yes, I would. Operetta and so on. What have you done with your chocolate? He's eaten it all up. What? Was it that good? Grandma should have brought more. How's your conjunctivitis? - Not so good. - It's a bit better though. - Have you been to the doctor? - Yes. We don't need the men when we go to town. You need our money, though. And how! That's what you're here for! That's where we play the main role. You always do that. You know that very well. - What's a woman without a man? - Yes. What's a woman without a man? And vice-versa, eh? I hope so. That's more your taste, eh? But if you had a nice love story... I'll try to remember. It can be something by Kolle, too. I watched it as well. You watched it, did you? What I wanted to ask... Did you see Alma Mater? I missed it unfortunately. - It was lovely. - Shall we sit down again? Really very nice. About a surgeon. Some lovely scenes. You can see it's true to life. You wouldn't think people like that could make mistakes! You think they're infallible. They make just as many mistakes. That was nice. It was quite long. ...then you can tell people out there in the world that you can reckon for yourself. If you can reckon well, no one can cheat you. You've done that very well. Next thing will be your Christmas grades. Don't you want to have a driver's licence? No, I'll wait till Kurt gets his. Kurt relies on his wife. You must get a car. We have one. I smashed up the old one. We have a new one now. - He should have one of his own. - One of his own? If the promotion comes through... He must have a driver's licence. I'll pay for it. Your mother will pay for it. It's not a question of the money. My son's intelligent enough. He's just a bit timid. He's a quiet sort. You can't be dreamy when you drive a car. He thinks I'm a careless driver. Yes, you do drive recklessly. I'm a bit nervous. You're a bit spoilt. - Really? - Yes. You can see you're an only child. Your parents spoilt you. You come from a good family. You're not a bad family, are you? Would you like a cigarette? Kurt, please. I'm so glad! My Kurt had the pick of the bunch. And he chose you! You were evidently the best. You must know. I can't say. Why don't you say anything? Now we're embarrassing him. - I'm not as bad as all that. - Of course you're not. It's beautiful, isn't it? Yes, it's lovely. The scenery is so pretty. Do you know what we did? We've put up a little house for the birds. Amadeus will love it. - In the garden? - Yes. You have your birdhouse, don't you Amadeus? I haven't seen it. You should have shown Grandma. The wild birds come into our garden. It's so pretty. It'll soon be Christmas. What are you giving Kurt? - We discussed it. You mean Kurt? - Yes. He needs a new suit. Have you put some money aside? A little. What do you mean, "a little"? I don't want Kurt being burdened with money matters for Christmas presents. He certainly wants to buy you something. Kurt gets a Christmas bonus. It would be better if you paid for your own surprises. I do. I always take a temporary job. Just a short period. But Kurt doesn't want me to work. I don't mean a regular job, but around Christmas it'd be better if you didn't bother Kurt and had your own money. I mean it well. A man should be able to support his family. Kurt can. So what's the problem? You could give him a surprise and say, "Look, I've bought this with my own money." That is much nicer. - Mom? - What is it? - Where's your son? - Where is he? Make sure he doesn't climb a tree! I'll look over there. Amadeus! You have to keep an eye on the boy. I was speaking with you. That doesn't matter. You have a son to look after. You can't rely on me. You can't expect me to look. You must be more careful. I'm meant to take him to my place! And he doesn't even listen! He'll probably climb up some tree. He's not wearing sturdy shoes either. Why do you dress him so lightly? No need to get angry. I'm not angry. I'm looking for him. Yes, I can see how you're looking. That's how you do it. Here he is! Is he there? What got into you? There he is. He just wanted to play hide-and-seek. You have to watch him better. You must look after him better. I'm always afraid when he's at our place over Christmas. Nothing happened, Mom. He was just trying to hide. At least he was not climbing trees. He's never done it before. He always runs around. Are you cold? Why did you run into the snow like that? You must keep an eye on him. I did. I looked away just for one second... And you are old enough... You and your seconds! Stop quarrelling! It's all over now. Now she's annoyed and runs off. I'm not annoyed, but I think our eternal squabbling is unnecessary. Can't I have an opinion of my own? I'm older than you. Don't get upset! I'm worried about the garage yard. Yes, the garage yard. Remember the bedroom tract is about this size and the second block comes here. I didn't want to say it in front of the others... You've solved the problem of the south and west facades, but the corner situation in the garage yard, here, the east face... - You know what I mean? - Yes. It needs to be reconsidered. Here's a satisfactory example. You've made a mistake. A drawing is only two-dimensional. We have to indicate the third dimension. You haven't solved the corner situation and the transition to the vertical volume. You have to consider that the main office will be working on the bedroom tract. And we need someone who can develop the scheme further. That's why I want to ask you to improve the spatial transition to the east block. And one other thing... Excuse me! Mrs. Eder? I'll do it later. Where was I? Yes. The link between the garages and the terrace area... And don't forget the two ash trees and the beech we want to keep. That's very important. Try to solve the problem with a model! We haven't much time left. It's a bit like Beyond Sing the Woods, part two, and we have to do the third part, forgetting Bj?rndal, of course. You understand what I mean? Technical perfection's not enough. You have to go beyond that. Only one of us can go to head office. - They haven't said anything to you? - I'm not so sure. Yes, there's a vacancy. It won't be me. - It's bound to be Mr. Raab. - Maybe. Or maybe Mr. Moland. I haven't been here long enough. Who's been here longest? Mrs. Eder, you've been here longest. I like it here. I'm staying here. They don't earn more at head office. Recently I was talking to... What's his name? Faltermayer. You remember him? Yes, I remember him. He told me it's not true. They don't earn more? I'm sure they do. He can't have been telling the truth. Stay here! There's more scope there. Maybe you have different tasks there. Don't you think so? It's more varied. - Why doesn't he drink his coffee with us? - Don't ask! Doesn't want to. - Did he complain? - Not at all. What are you doing? Can I have a cigarette? It's very nice, Mrs. Eder. - I was one... - Which one? Anything left in the kitty? You shouldn't ask. Everything out of the kitty, right? Do we have so much coffee money? Dishwater! Taste good? Why, can you hear it? Not exactly. Do you have any small change? Mine are finished. Can I have one? Say "pussyfoot", Moland! Pussyfoot. Not easy with a full mouth, eh? Have you finished your Esso hotel? No. It's a real headache. Especially the windows. Windows? Don't you like drawing windows? She's absolutely hysterical. There's no other word for it. She flipped out when they had that gas explosion. You wouldn't believe it. "What'll I do when my husband comes home? "It'll cost a fortune! I could have been killed! "Imagine if there had been more gas!" She nearly had a fit. I just don't get on with them. Always moaning and criticising. And they make so much noise. You're there only in the evening. I have to put up with them all day. Look! Would you like that in the apartment? What is it? Her husband's no better either. They go well together. Think of having to live with them! Oh, look at this! Isn't it pretty? Neoclassical. Shall we buy it? Or ask what it costs? You have no feeling for art. Oh, well, you can't have everything. Goodbye! Well, Mrs. Ullrich. I wanted to ask you about Amadeus. I'm glad you came. He's a rather difficult boy. He's weak in arithmetic. I know. - Do you help him at home? - I go through his homework with him. And I spend time with him afterwards. I think he's made progress, too. He's not bad at mental arithmetic if he concentrates. That's important in his case. He's often inattentive. Sometimes, when the class has finished an exercise, he hasn't even understood the question. The other day, we were doing multiplication tables. I asked, "What's 6 times 7?" The other children knew the answer. I asked Amadeus to repeat my question. He hadn't been listening at all. That shows he lacks concentration. It's not a lack of intelligence. I spoke to the psychologist the other day. She did an intelligence test with him. The result was quite normal. He has a good average IQ. He should be an average student. He just lacks concentration. And he's withdrawn. He has difficulty fitting in with the others. How is he at home with friends? He has two good friends, a girl and a boy. I haven't noticed anything. How does he behave when he plays with them? Is he often left out? No. He gets on well with them. I haven't noticed anything. You don't have the impression that they look down on him? No, although I was afraid they would, because of his speech impediment. He has difficulty saying "SH." I've noticed that in the reading and writing exercises. - Does he have problems in class? - Yes, but the class reacts in a friendly way. Nobody has ever teased him about it. I'm glad. If children are teased, they stop trying. That's when it gets difficult. Amadeus isn't afraid of the class making fun of him. We have another child who can't distinguish P and F and makes mistakes in dictation. They don't tease him either. In that respect, the class spirit is no problem. What's the situation at home? I don't go out to work. I really do have time for him. You don't go out to work. That's very important for children. Does he often ask you questions? He's a bit withdrawn. I have to ask him. He doesn't tell you himself? Doesn't he tell you about school or school outings? Yes, he has to, because he has to leave early. But you're right. He's a bit withdrawn. You could stimulate him by asking him specific questions and letting him express himself freely. It's very important for children to practise oral expression. That's what I do. Cigarettes? Help yourselves to the cigarettes! - Do you smoke? - Yes, thank you. - Don't put yourself to so much trouble! - It's okay. Very nicely furnished here. Quite expensive for a technician. - A draughtsman. - A tracer. I don't understand it either. She doesn't work, does she? - I can't imagine it. - It's possible. You think so? How do they do it? There, it's ready. May I pour you some coffee? It's just like our place. The apartments must be alike. We won't be neighbours for much longer. You already know it? Why not? My husband hopes to better himself. - In his job? - Yes. We'll probably move into a bigger apartment. What'll his new job be? In the administration probably. Most likely in another town. - May I sit next to you? - Sure. Will the pay be better? Oh, yes. Are there no opportunities here? Yes, but not as good. - Can you give me a light? - Of course. I shouldn't talk about it yet. It's still not absolutely certain. But he'd have much better pay? Yes, that would be much better. Your husband's really putting on weight. It suits him, don't you think? But he's in good health? His health's fine. If you move away, your son... My son said that yours isn't very good at school. He only wants to do things he likes. He doesn't like arithmetic, but he loves singing and gymnastics. Those are his strong points. I think that's all right. One should encourage it. He won't be a professional singer, but if he likes singing... I don't think it means much at that age. I don't think so either. You needn't worry. At that age, it's difficult to tell where a child's abilities lie. Ours are also a bit too playful. Chris will be upset. Yes, Michael plays so nicely with Amadeus. - Is the coffee okay? - Very good, indeed. Yes, very good. Will you be able to use this furniture in the new apartment? I haven't even seen it yet. Maybe you'll need new furniture. Maybe, if the rooms are different. And you're not so active culturally, are you? You don't go to the theatre much, do you? Oh, yes, I do. I love theatre and opera and so on. We simply couldn't live without it. It depends on your husband's profession, of course. And the new school for your son... Yes, it's difficult. But a better salary is also important. Our son is more important. But I hope he'll be able to adapt. Children get used to those things more quickly than adults. - Probably! - You shouldn't worry about that. Children bounce back easily. They're adaptable. You said it! Where did you go for your vacation? We didn't go far. To our parents in Alt?tting. Oh, God! Is there any ketchup? Cheers! Here's to our typist! The word "typist" is forbidden. It's uncivilised. Come on! - Don't you like dancing on your own? - No. Gerhard, don't squeeze my wife so tight! - It is not such an important event. - I feel so embarrassed. - Shall we? - What are you saying? Dear Mrs. Maron, dear Mr. Maron, dear Miss Maron, dear boss, my dear... My dear colleague... Dear colleagues! Allow me to say something on the subject of the working atmosphere, which I believe is very good. You might even say it's not just good, it's very friendly. That is to say, the atmosphere is friendly, and on the whole co-operative. But, as I said, we do not... Generally speaking, we are not just a body of people. Our office consists of individuals. I should like to single out one person in particular, our dear Mrs. Eder, whom I'd like to congratulate. You are a most friendly and helpful person. If anyone has done anything for the working atmosphere, then it is you. But also our Mr. Moland. He can be very critical... How can I say this? Very critical, but he's a very pleasant member of the team, as is Benjamin. His present state proves how happy he is with us. You must excuse him, dear Mr. Maron, if he's a bit drunk. It's nothing serious. We don't have to work tomorrow. And I should not forget to express our thanks to the boss. He can be very strict, but he has a kind heart. Dear Mr. Maron, won't you drink a toast of friendship with me? Well, I think we must be... Or won't you drink to fraternity with all of us? - We have such a... - Just take it easy! ...good working relationship. You may be the boss, but you can drink to our friendship. We must go, or she won't get home. I have to go so far. But why do you want... Mr. Raab, no... No, I'm sorry, but Sybille lives a long way off. One more drink. We must be getting home. I have to drive. And there's snow outside. Why won't you drink a toast to fraternity? It would be good for our work together. Please excuse us! You carry on. Don't let us spoil the party. We could have been buddies. You must understand, we have a long drive home. Do I have my cigarettes? Excuse me, Mrs. Raab. Bye, then! Carry on with the party! Bye, Mrs. Eder. - Enjoy yourselves, then! - Bye! Aren't you interested in promotion? - What did I say? - The way you behaved! There's a time and place for everything. What did I do wrong? The older you get, the more stupid you become, and fatter. Even the neighbours are talking about it. - The neighbours? - Yes, the neighbours. Mrs. Eder thought it was a good idea. Mrs. Eder is Mrs. Eder, and my neighbours are my neighbours. Don't talk with them so much! You must learn to restrain yourself. At home you can't find your tongue, and here you don't stop talking bullshit! Come over here! Read aloud to me! "The Eagle. The eagle is a big bird "with broad swishing wings." You must practise that, "swishing wings". "Swishing wings". Say "SH" on its own! Put your tongue further back! The tongue back still further. Say it again, "swishing wings". "Swishing wings". Still not right. Again! "Swishing wings". Whenever you have an "S-H", you must practise it. Otherwise you'll have difficulties later. Start again from the beginning! "The Eagle. "The eagle is a big bird "with broad, swishing wings. "It can fly very high. "From on high, everything seems small in size." - What's that? - "Z". A "Z". Read it again! "From on high everything seems small in size "and it can see very far. "When the eaglets have grown up, "they fly away "and never come back. "I saw an eagle in the zoo. "Locked up in a cage, "it is sad and doesn't move. "But when it is free, it soars into the sky "and circles there, this great black bird." Are you visiting anyone else? I don't know where they are. They've all moved out to the country. Oh, you want to do that at the same time? Maybe we could go there together over the weekend. I wouldn't mind seeing Straubing again. I haven't been there for ages. Everything's changed, I'm sure. - Mr. Raab! - Yes? With all respect for your artistic nature and your need to communicate, could you keep your phone calls short at this time of day? I've been trying to get Cologne for half an hour. - Yes, of course. Excuse me. - Be so good! I have to stop now. Till this evening, then. See you around 7:00. Bye! He didn't recognise me. He'd probably forgotten me. At the time, he wanted to sock me. - He chased you... - Yes, round the table. ...with a chair in his hand, shouting, "I'll get you!" You've never run as fast as that at work. At the door I turned and said, "Okay, I'm going to hit you." He hesitated for a moment... Didn't you throw an inkwell at him? The others were standing nearby laughing. He gave them a taste of the same medicine. Then he chased you again. He was mad because we laughed. Geiger was louder, and he whacked him. Then he chased you again to the dormitory. And Warscht... In the meantime, he was in a psychiatric clinic. He had a persecution complex. In the end, he was always going to the station telling people he was waiting for the train to Paris because he was being persecuted in Straubing, he said, not just by his students, but by the teachers. He said they were his enemies, and they were out to kill him. His neighbour... He said, she wanted to kill him, too. He was away for a few months, I think. But he's back now, teaching English again. Rabenbauer, "You're the president. Pull yourself together!" I remember him always looking for the person who broke the windows. It was all made up. He was always uptight. Whenever anyone spoke, when the students talked during his lessons, he thought they were talking about him. He thought they were mimicking him, smiling like Cheshire cats and winding him up. The funniest day was always Friday on the rostrum. Together with Geiger and Moland. You were always strict with us. You told us off when we made fun of people, or when we made reading mistakes, the Gospels or Epistles... Totally mixed up. And Moland, I think, always sang half a tone... Always sang off key. And the "A" you gave him... O Lord, you sacrificed your flesh and blood You just couldn't get him to sing any better. Yes, he didn't hear it properly. As a consolation, he was allowed to read the Epistles. You intoned the Canticles and we bellowed our heads off. Down below, the others didn't sing anyway. And at the altar, Utz left out the prayers because he was ashamed of us or of his students. Then he sang himself, very loud. Oh, where am I to turn? - Is that your boy's? - Yes, it belongs to him. We sang some beautiful songs. Really fervently! And we had to go to church on Sundays. You always told me to go. I was a bit lazy. I thought I could sleep longer on Sunday. I was firmly convinced... "Even if you don't believe, you've got to go," you said. Willi convinced me and I really went now and then, at least, on Sunday. Oh, where am I to turn when grief and pain oppress me? Whom should I tell of my delight when joyful beats my heart? To you, to you O Father I come in joy and pain You send us all the joys You heal our suffering My firm has sent me for a routine check-up, Doctor. The boss sends us every six months. It's a sensible idea. It has enabled us to spot the occasional serious illness. Any problems lately? Not exactly problems. I still suffer from headaches. Not too often? When do they occur? Mostly after work. In the evening, then? You don't wake up in the morning with a headache? No, mostly at home in the evening. You prescribed some pills for me. I have to take two or three. One doesn't help. Maybe I need stronger ones. We'll change the prescription. Let's see. Show me. That's okay. Does that hurt? No, just the beating. - I beg your pardon? - I just feel you beating. - Do you have pains here? - No. - And here? - No. Not here either? Maybe you're a bit overworked. How many cigarettes do you smoke? Forty a day. - Forty? - Yes. That's a bit too much. You should cut down. I'll check your blood pressure. If you'd remove your jacket. And roll your sleeve right up. Lay your arm on here. Your blood pressure's a little too high. The cigarettes are partly to blame. I advise you to quit smoking and your headaches will stop. Maybe you should also take things a bit easier. Sometimes it begins here at the back or near the temples. It's nothing serious, Mr. Raab. You have slightly raised blood pressure. It's certainly related to your smoking. And maybe you've been overworking. Take a fortnight off. Have a rest and stop smoking. That won't be so easy. I'm sure. But it's for your own good. Come to see me again in a month or two and we'll see if it's any better. - How's your wife? - Very well, thanks. She's coming to see you next week. Good. - Thank you, Doctor. - Bye! There's nothing organically wrong. - Everything's okay. - Good. Thank you. Bye! On Thursday I'll be at head office. Must see how to get in there. It's probably difficult. There aren't that many jobs. And with a new guy there... I had an offer the other day, better salary and better prospects. It's a bigger firm. Here in Munich? Yes. It would be quite an opportunity, but I don't know anyone except the friend who could get me the job. I'm not sure. - I must think about it. - Would it be better than here? Yes. The work would be more varied. Maybe less individual than here, though. Exactly. Yes, everyone knows everyone. It's so important how you get on with your colleagues. What do you think of Mrs. Eder? A bit funny. She always says she's feeling fine when you ask. I believe her. That's the impression she makes. A very unassuming woman, modest, and very kind. - A bit of an old maid. - I couldn't say so. I like her, too. I've run out of that, too. Does it matter? I was in town today. I saw some nice stores. You'll have them again tomorrow. Did you fix things with Fischer? Not quite. But I wouldn't let the matter rest. We have to continue our discussion. We can't do it over the phone. Don't you want that any more? Was Andrea here today? Did you play together? Have you done your homework? Yes? Did you look through his arithmetic? - Or shall I do it? - I had no time. Would you do it? Did it work out? I have a lot of homework. Don't speak while you're eating! What do you have? A lot of homework. And a written assignment? More movement! Up to 2.40 with the light. Could I have the green felt-tip pen? Here, but I need it afterwards. And because there's a basement, it's too expensive to put it there. If you create some height there... If the floor is... Maybe we could achieve a 2.60 bulkhead height. Mr. Raab, here! Thanks! With 2. 30 we could increase the storey height. We can put the rest in the parking storey. ...my ski vacation! I'm looking forward so much. For eleven months of the year I can think of nothing but skiing. I'm going with my friends. We're renting a house in a village. It's cheaper than a hotel. We'll drive there together. Eight of us altogether. When we go skiing, we get up at 7:00. By 9:00, we're on the slopes. There are still very few people. By 10:00 or 11:00, you have to stand in line for hours. It's terrible! We're at the top by 10 o'clock and do a big downhill run. It's really fantastic! It's unbelievable! All that snow, and the sun! It's a dream! There's a really long run to Klosters, 11 miles long. It just goes on and on. There are lots of routes to choose from. It's fabulous! At the top, it's ever so steep. Two years ago I was scared to death. I couldn't ski so well then. I had an instructor. I had to, of course. I took a ski course. I picked it up very quickly. It's no problem if you ski every day. I fell in love, of course. My boyfriend was angry. It was a real fight between him and the instructor. Marvellous! You start with the stem turn. - You know how it's done? - No. No, first you learn the snowplough with your legs pressed outward so you don't go too fast. When you've learnt that, you do the stem turn with your legs wide apart. It looks terrible. But when you can do that, you're over the moon. The second year, I started wedeling. It's marvellous! I flip out when I see Toni Sailer. You ski faster when you wedel. It's not easy, but it's better on a steep run. You ski over the bumps better. It requires much less effort. When the slope's flatter, you have to use your hips. It looks easy, child's play. But it's damned difficult, especially with my seven-foot skis. It's extremely long. I need them because I'm so tall, you know. I bought myself new skis, steel ones, and a new outfit. It's quilted. Not like the old ones with tight pants. You wear it over the ski pants and it's straight like a modern pair of pants. The same colour as the anorak. Real elegant! There's tremendous competition. I can imagine. So I've bought this smart outfit and the skis, absolutely fantastic. I'm looking forward so much... - There's just one thing... - I'll fetch some more. Thanks. I must tell you... Last time I was skiing with one of our clique and we had a race and a friend of ours broke a leg! It was terrible! I was depressed all day. - Finally the Akia arrived. - The what? Akia, it's the name of a rescue service. Two mountain guides with a kind of sledge. They hold it at the front and back and ski down... Come in! - Hello. - Hello! - Are you in charge here? - Yes. What can I do for you? My name's Hamm. Crime squad. We're looking for Mr. Raab. He works here. What's the problem? Nobody phoned to tell you? Phoned? Who? - Nobody told you? - I have no information at all. His son, his wife and a neighbour were found dead in his apartment. - Oh, my God! - Can I speak to him? You mean Mr. Raab's wife? - My God! - May I speak to him? Yes, of course. Where is Mr. Raab? In the bathroom. Inspector! Just imagine, he killed his wife and son. - What makes you think that? - You just said so! Nobody said that. His wife and son are dead, aren't they? That doesn't mean what you think. - Did he come to work on time? - As usual. He's usually punctual. He arrived at the same time as me. That was shortly after 8:00. Did he behave suspiciously? I wasn't here. - Were you all here at 8:00? - Yes. - And Mr. Raab arrived later? - No. No, he came in with me. Mr. Raab was alone? No, he came up with me. When did it happen? Last night. We're not sure. I don't believe it! Mr. Raab couldn't have done it. We don't know whether he did. Have you all worked here as long as Mr. Raab? No, he's been here longest. Are you a personal friend? Any personal contacts with him? No. I know him only at work. And you? He doesn't talk much. Have you ever been to his place? Do you know his wife? Yes. She's very nice. Have you ever visited him at home? And you? I've met his wife, but I've never been to their place. We hardly ever meet socially. But it's terrible news. Terrible! How long has Raab been with us? Eighteen months? Absolutely terrible! So you've noticed nothing out of the ordinary? He's been a bit quiet lately. A lot of people are quiet. He had a strange phone conversation recently. - When? - Some relative of his. A school friend. - When was that? - When was it? Some time ago now. Maybe a week ago, or was it a fortnight? Someone came to visit them and his wife phoned up. How do you know they had a visitor? They were talking about it. - On the phone? - Yes. Terrible! Not a sound in there. Mr. Raab? Oh, my God!
