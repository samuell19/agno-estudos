Fuckin' things! Where are you going? I wanna go home! Jan! Lead poisoning. Nothing you can do. Think you can bullshit us? You know how many birds are killed by traffic every day? No, how many? A lot. Asshole. Dieter, go with him. Can you hold this? Is it a buzzard? A common buzzard. A female. Thanks. Jan? Hey. Hey. Assholes! What were you doing? What now? Shit! Call my dad. Mailbox. - Give it here. - It was his mailbox. Christin, here. - I'll get the car. Wait here. - I wanna go home, man! - Forget something? - The tractor won't start. What are you up to? Maintenance work. Klaus, can you look at this? What's this about? I thought you could give me a ride. I could. Where you headed? Where are you going? Hamburg. Great. And where there, precisely? She won't pass inspection, anyway. We'll take a nice ride and... When's the date, in October? Yeah, she'll make it. Sure. Sleep well? Remember where you're going? A truck stop on the harbour. - Where precisely? - The first one. I need to deliver something. What are you delivering? Doesn't matter, right? Left here. Here? - Should I wait? - Nah. It sticks. I'll let you out. Well, then. Bye. Yeah, take care. Torsten! Christin? What are you... doing here? Can I get a ride? How did you get here? The train. Alone? - Did you want to scare me? - No, I had to take a piss. What ya doin'? Done with work. Come on, get in. Go ahead. Open that. Where were you? Hamburg. No shit! My mum's. You know where she is? Just found out. Funny, Caro didn't tell me. She doesn't know. Is that gas? Yeah, but keep it to yourself. NO ONE'S WITH THE CALVES Morning. Morning. Veggies? I'm in the office. Goin' to the city? No. 'Cause of the get-up. Where you goin'? Hello! - Leave her be. - Look how she's dressed... Like I said: Lead has nothing to do with it. Bet they didn't even send the bird in. Just threw it away, the assholes. You got anything to say? Hey, babe, what are you up to? My handsome hubby said he brought you home last night. You comin' over? Hey, sweetie. So was he hot? Was he? Oh, man, was he hot! And such a huge cock. Fuck me. Oh, come on. - Fuck me. - Idiot. Fuck me, fuck me. What did Jan say? Silent treatment again. You gotta understand. That thing with his mum was bad. Of course he worries. - My mum's gone, too. - But she didn't die. - Morning. - Hey! I'm going shopping. Need anything? We got any soda? It's on the list. Anything else? Nope. You doin' the calves? Great. It's always the same with women. They buy shoes for 1,000 euros. You can't even call it "buying", 'cause we pay. And if you don't buy them, they don't give you the goods. Why do they always want to be so tall? Ten-metre heels? Then they trip! - Hey, boss. - Danilo! Hello. Hey... And Jan? Where's Jan? He can't spend his whole life milking. It's awful you can't employ anyone. He needs to get out for a change! We've got Torsten. He's a sweetheart, sure. I thought he was in jail. - Who, Danilo? - Got released. Poisoned his stepfather's pigs. Poor devil... If I were him, I'd poison the old man. He's a pervert. Can I have the key to the john? But we got porta-potties. Only for you. I'm joining. Should I let you out? I'm fine. Unlock the door, bitch. May I? I'm overflowing and need to talk. What's this hobo up to? What? Can you please leave? Want some? Open the door, you cunt. - Fuck you, dude. - Watch it. Fuck you, dude. Fuck you. I'll get the door. Thanks. I'm in love, Christin. It's so... so... - bad! - Who is it? I'm goin' nuts. Absolutely nuts. Who is it? I gotta see him. Who, Caro? Diamantis. He's Greek. Wicked ass. - Torsten will kill me. - It'll pass. I don't want it to. I can't stay in this dump forever. Can you give me a hug? Can you give me a...? Give me a hug! Fuck, is that your dad? Sorry, sweetie! He arrived wasted. I'll bring you home. Drive them home, Torsten. - I just said that. - You're exhausted, anyway. Call me later, babe. My friends, you're my... I don't get it. I just don't get it... Help out. Help out a bit. What did I do...? Christin? Christin? Come here. Christin? Don't go. Go! Just go! I'll be fine. It's alright, I can manage... Let's drive into town later. Can you still hose down the crevices after? Hey. You back? What happened? Some dicks broke the lock. Which sucks. Is that a bat? A bird, I think. They get lost. How do they get in? How do rats get in attics? Who knows? I gotta go to the van. You comin'? Wait. I'll be right back. You work on the farm? We're supposed to take it over some day. Your boyfriend and you. But his dad doesn't like me. No? You don't like it there? Nope. And why not do something else? - It's all I can do. - I don't believe that. But that's how it is. What's your dream? City life. My own apartment. And what else? I don't know, maybe... something of my own. My own joint, say. What kind of joint? Who cares? I do. I'm off. Will you be back tomorrow? Caro? Where are you? Hey Christin! Where you goin'? To see Papa. We can do that later. We gotta go. You're comin'. - I told him I'm coming. - Tell him you'll come later. Why? Why? Cause we gotta go. Here we go, come on. In we go. Come on. That's right. Easy, girl. Easy. Easy now. Easy, girl. She's pregnant. More than three months. Take care. We'll take my car. - Come in, unless it's the Reaper. - Hey. What's he doin' in there? We brought you food. I didn't order any. You can take it with you. Man, man, man, what an honour. The whole family turning up... I said you can take it away! Look at the state of you. You're a slut like your mother. He doesn't even notice, right? You shakin' that ass in those panties. He's milkin' udders all day! What the fuck are you doing? Stop fuckin' 'round with the fridge! Where are your people? No idea. There's a barn where we store hay. You wanna go there? Lie down on that. Tomorrow at 8. Can you come? Where are you? At the beech tree. I'll get my wheel loader. I can drive you. Look. LOVE! I didn't think you'd come. We're going to Denmark tomorrow. There's a great beach we visit every year. We rent a wooden house, one of those red ones. It's really pretty. And the beach? No one's there. It's all ours. Last year, we built a hut with the kid. We have to pack but I don't feel like it. Torsten here. I can't answer or have no reception. Leave a message, thanks. You comin', Jan? C'mon! Prinz? You can't come with me. You can't come. Sit. Hey, Prinzy. Christin. Christin. Our barn burned down. Can you believe it? Fuckin' unbelievable. I mean, who would do such a thing? Shit! Shit, I need to go milk. Wait, I'll do it. - Morning. - Morning. You manage? I'm off. What a surprise! Hello, Christin! What are you doin' here? - Is it a bad time? - No. Come have a hug. Jeez! Come in! - I just wanted to see if Caro's in. - No, she's not. She's nowhere to be seen. Shoes off, that's right. You're lucky I'm in. On my lunch break. Have a seat. You're lookin' good. - What's my young lady up to? - Nothin'. - Nothin'? What kind of nothin'? - Nothin'. You're stickin' together, huh? Somethin' to eat? I ate, but you want something? No wonder you girls are so skinny. I tell Caro, "You've got to eat!" Oh, hello! Look, it's Wolfi. Look who's here! You remember him? Look who's here! This is new: He thinks he's a dog. Yes, sweetie! Watch it or you'll get a hiding. It's just like with people. They get worse with age. It's so great to see you! Really, he's goin' nuts. Don't laugh, it's not funny. It's a disorder: He thinks he's a dog. He gets so aggressive sometimes. You know I have Martha now? - Have you seen her? - Caro sent a pic. Ah, a pic! Then you needn't come by! Such a lovely girl. Incredible. Not like the others. And I didn't even want her. Here. Hit him with this. He's not allowed on the sofa. Hit him when he passes. What about you and Jan havin' kids? It's high time. Nope. "Nope?" Don't want any kids? Kids are the best! I'm so thirsty. It's so humid. Have a drink. Three litres a day. But I mean, you can't plan a child. Fate decides. Some couples try for years. You think they're great, they have work and everything, but it doesn't work and you wonder... But I tell myself: The Lord knows if it's to be or not. Now tell me: What's up with Caro? Is she in trouble? She's always in trouble. Really. Always bad, bad... I once said, "Get in the car. I'm swapping you for a nice boy at the market". That shut her up, I can tell you. She doin' alright? - Really? - Yeah. Look, I got one, too. Hey, Danilo. How's it goin'? Good. And you? You're real sweet. - Is it a Rottweiler? - A mutt. Part Rottweiler. You're so pretty. Thanks. You live here now? Opposite Caro's mom. She's nuts, huh? And what's your name? Pitbull. Pitbull! What are you up to? I don't know yet. We'll see. - I gotta go. - Sure. Maybe we can hang out. If you've got time. Text me. My number is the same. Come on, Pitbull! You're real cheesy. You're cheesy. Maybe I'd be with Anne now. We'd be married... with three kids. Or am I wrong? You knew, huh? What? Caro's lover. Her lover-boy. Left me a note on the kitchen table. Imagine that! After all the years, a note. What a cunt. What a cunt. I mean, just... Ah, fuck it. Go back to fixin' your roses. You women are good at that. Nice. Real nice. Alright, let's sing. Anne... Since this day is your birthday, we thought... Sing along. We thought that what we'd do Is sing to you a song so gay You'll like it, knowing you Please sing along. There's even a pretty bouquet of flowers For the birthday child that's you And if you put them in a vase They'll keep a long time, too And if you have a birthday cake As big as the wheel of a bus Plus plenty of chocolate with it, too Then share it please with us! Man, this is nice! Nice, just the three of... I think it's nice. Shall we? I know your secret, too. What? Let's drink to it, huh? To the cunts! She's been movin' like crazy all day. Want to feel? Prinz? Prinz. Where are you? Hello to you, too. You still there? I didn't want to talk about it. I thought it wouldn't come true then, you know? And your flat? That's just stuff. I have to tell you something. Maybe you already know. It's no big deal. RAT POISON It was Torsten and Mark. And Jan, I think, who vandalised the turbines. Not only on your field, but on the others, too. Really? That sealed the deal for me. I gotta eat. Let's talk tomorrow. I miss you. And don't tell Torsten anything. He has to cool down first. Sure. Take care, sweetie. Jan? Jan? Come on, let's go. Jan. On you go. - What's wrong? - Come on. You can't hold me. Come out and calm down. Can I help you, young lady? I wanted to see Danilo. Make him get dressed. I would if this asshole would get off me. - Get dressed, we're going. - We'll take this, too. "We'll take this, too". Always the same with you damn pigs! You all need to die. Right, come on. - Too late. - I know. - Can I take my keys? - You may. I'll have more time next time. Promise.
