HANK: Here is Korea, where the 1st Marine Division is holding the line against the North Koreans and the Chinese hordes. My name is Hank Dyer. And like most war correspondents, I'm writing a book between dispatches, not on the grand scale of Caesar's Commentaries, nor about master strategies in the triumph of giant machines, but about the smallest commodity of modern war: men. Particularly about the men of Gunnery Sergeant Hawkins' platoon. Gunny's got both fools and wise men here, but none who lacks guts and strength. Pete Kono, the veteran campaigner; Russ Waller, the quiet one; Newt Levells, the naive, likeable galoot from Texas. Quite a contrast to Skip Roth, with his glossy shrewdness, known to his confidents as The Brain. Or David Chatfield, the Back Bay aristocrat. It took some doing to trim him to the Marine pattern, and there's still some doubt that the operation was a success. And then there's that born leader, Let's Go McCaffrey, busted from sergeant to private, but don't let that fool you. It happened on furlough, not out here. The fields of war are the only circuit that can take that big fuse-blower. And for better or for worse, he's the guy these men follow. (jet engines roaring) (jet engines roaring) Let's go! We'll hole up here. Dig in. -McCaffrey. -Yo. Work your fire team down to that bunker; check it out. Hey, let's go! Let's go! You guys cover me and Skip. We'll get them out of there. Don't knock them off. We'll bring them in. Hey, Sarge, you want to take these guys along with yours? Sure, Mac. Gunny. Yeah? Who is he? Harper. -How many didn't make it, Hawkins? -Six missing. -Charley Harper? -Harper will be back. I hear Harper got it. -Tough break, Mac. -How would you know? He wasn't a buddy of yours; he was a buddy of mine. Why don't you speak plain, McCaffrey? Spare me that customary delicacy of yours for a change. Don't give me that college crapola, you pedigree pup! Come on, Dave, don't think anything of it. It's that kind of a day. No, it's routine. I get born in a bed with silk sheets, and he's dedicated to the principle of never letting me forget it! I don't care how you was born, just get that snoot of yours down out of the air, Chatfield! "Were born," Mac, not "was born." -Who you talking to? -"Whom," not "who," and a verb after it would further improve the syntax. Don't bug me, Skip. I don't feel like slugging you today. Come on. McCaffrey, such an act of physical violence -will soon be beneath your dignity. -What? I hear you're gonna be promoted for meritorious service, skipping the rank of corporal right up to sergeant. -Huh? -Oh, no. What, you're not happy about it? Promotions can lose a guy a lot of old buddies. Now, don't you worry, McCaffrey, you'll get busted again, just as you always do. (laughter) Yeah, it's kind of confusing to remember what my rank is. Well, anyhow, here's the rest of the news. This outfit's going into regimental reserve. Should mean a leave for the Let's Go McCaffrey Club. And that'll mean Japan! Yahoo! I'll bet you'll be glad to get the furlough. My wife's coming down to Yokosuka from Tokyo. She works there in the Department of Army Civilian Employees. And you know something? This will be our first chance for a honeymoon. We were called back into action five minutes after I said, "I do." Sounds like quite a change from this out here. Yeah, but there's a catch to it. Some of the men are going to Yokosuka for rest and rehabilitation. Lieutenant asked me unofficially to keep an eye on them. -McCaffrey? -McCaffrey and some of the other guys. He's up for decoration. We want him in top shape for the big brass. That's a large order for McCaffrey. Right. A headache to the enemy, but a real migraine to the MPs. (people speaking Japanese) Hi. (sighs) My prayers are answered. My brave one comes back. Not so brave, Song Do. McCaffrey's been having severe doubts about me lately. -The one you call Let's Hurry Up Go? -Uh-huh. Maybe it's his way to hide that he's not brave himself. Oh, no, you can't take that away from him. He's a wild bull, and that also goes for his mentality. For three days and three nights, I listen to the guns. I watch the sky red with fire. I felt the ground tremble, and I trembled too with terror for your safety. And when sleep tried to close my eyes, your face was always before me. And I would awake my grandfather with cries in the night. Is your grandfather well? Yes, but so old. This war has grieved him. He will not wake up someday. And then you'd be alone. You won't be alone, Song Do. I'll pull through alive. And no matter where else they send me, I'll get back to you somehow. (laughs) Lee-san. Sit down, my good friend. And, uh, don't think you must bear gifts each time we see you. It is you yourself whom we love. I heard a rumor that I might get a leave before long. And I thought you might need a few things while I'm away-- some canned fruit, chocolate, rice and tea. You will not pass this way again before you go? No, I'm afraid not. Then my letter will find you, care of postmaster. Your family would never accept Song Do. No, but I accept her. I love her, and that's that. I've broken with the past. It all happened when I wanted to be a Marine with my father holding out for desk commission in Washington. I wanted to be a Marine. Why do you not go to McCaffrey and tell him these things? Try and talk to McCaffrey? Never. And yet, a little while ago, you talked of him as though you admired him. You know, it's strange, Lee-san, but I do admire him. I think it would be one of the happiest days of my life if he ever walked up to me, shook my hand and said, "Chatfield, you'll be all right." (playing melody) * * Hup, hup, hup, two, three * Hear him call, "Let's go" * Come on, Marines, let's go * Hit the deck, leatherneck * Fall in line, double time * Hear him call, "Let's go" * Come on, Marines, let's go * We're going to make some history along the battle line. * So every officer and man in our services should appoint himself an ambassador of good will. Both in manners and speech, he should impress our allies and even our enemies with our sincerity and cordiality. Man, this whole thing's beginning to undermine your character. You just worry about your own character. I don't want my buddies horsing around on leave like a bunch of Navajo Indians. And you talk about Chatfield. Look at him moping. Probably over some flat-chested society dame who's cheating on him. I can read the mind of that punk like a skull with window glass. I can hear you. Yeah, you're brilliant, you are. Well, maybe you can tell me what we're gonna do for money. I um, guess you guys heard that I ran into a little bad luck against a pair of loaded dice down at the airstrip, and we are, as they say, flat on our honkers. But I'm thinking all the time. (chuckles) Yeah, that's it-- when old Skip starts thinking, we got nothing to worry about. So let's get down to the real tactical stuff. Levells, as usual, you'll do scout patrol. Only you got a tougher problem this time: finding a couple of kimono cuties who likes a guy for himself and not his dough. Deal me out. I got a gal, and she lives right there in Yokosuka where we're going. Your duty to your buddies comes first. Nah, come on, Newt, you can't let us down. Why, you got a knack for meeting more girls accidentally than most guys do on purpose. Maybe so, but them days are over. That's what you think. I'm not asking you; I'm telling you. Well, listen, you don't have to find a broad for me. I got my own. Well, I'll be happy to act as an interpreter for you guys. The language of love is universal, especially when the cherry blossoms are in bloom. And according to my calendar, the, uh, cherries should be ripe while we're in Japan. I cut this out of the, uh, Yokosuka American. Says, "Hotel Okamoto, "catering to the best, family trade, "has own bathhouse on premises, refined scrub girls, expert manipulators and certified masseuses." (laughs) I'd buy that! What with? You just keep thinking. You'll figure an angle, Skip. See that cigar? That's the same kind that Winston smokes. I remember I was coming back in a convoy with him, and I said, uh, "Winnie, how'd you like the trip?" And he said... (clears throat) "Well, jolly good, jolly good, except for one thing. (clears throat) "There were 11 of your American Marines "chasing three of our British nurses "up and down the deck of the ship. "And never (coughs) have so many chased so few, so far, and received so little." (laughter) Glad to see you chose a fine, respectable place. Are you sure your finances can handle it? Thrift will be necessary. Take it easy; tomorrow's a big day for Mac's decoration. Yeah, thanks for helping us with the transportation, Gunny. That's all right. I'll be using your driver once in a while. This looks like a pretty classy joint. What are we gonna use for money? Relax, Mac. I got a little gadget in here that'll take care of the room rent in nothing flat. What is it, a bomb? Nope. It's a much more modern work of science. Pete, you stay here and do like I told you. Ten-hut! (speaks Japanese) Greetings and salutations from my distinguished commander. He will require a private room and bath, plus two others for his staff. Who is he? (shushes) Military secret. His code name is Red Fox. Family hotel, catering only to respectable, married families. My good man, we are here on a mission of the utmost delicacy which can only be accomplished in a hotel of the most peerless respectability, and yet you refuse to aid us. Very sorry, very sorry. "Very sorry, very sorry." Well, Captain Sampson and the chief of staff will be keenly disappointed to hear this. Red Fox calling Blue Boy. Blue Boy. Blue Boy. Red Fox calling Blue Boy. Blue Boy, Blue Boy. Come in, Red Fox. Over. Red Fox, sir, there are no accommodations available in the hotel that General McArthur selected. Over. Who say so, the manager? Put him on. If the honorable Japanese manager won't cooperate with the honorable American intelligence units on a secret mission, then he's put his country in a very dishonorable mess. Over. No, no, no, no. Japanese people always cooperate with great hospitality. Japan very much love occupying American. -How nice. -Yes, yes. Commander? (clears throat) Red Fox. No more? (shushes) Ah. (bell dings) -Where are the phones? -You got phones? -There, sir. -Crazy. (over radio): Red Fox, Red Fox, don't forget a double bed for Blue Boy. Oh, Blue Boy's quite a joker. You'd be crazy about him. (chuckles) -(typing) -"Don't forget a double bed for Blue Boy"? Well, what is it? What is it? Captain Sampson, sir, I just picked this out of the air, and I'm a little confused by the code names. "Honorable hotel, Red Fox, Blue Boy, General MacArthur." I swear, Captain, I took it down verbatim. "Intelligence unit on secret mission, a double bed for Blue Boy." Intelligence's coding system must be all fouled up. Tell them to run this down and call it Operation Gainesboro. Aye-aye, sir. We have very finest bath in Japan on roof. Very strong and pretty girls for scrubbing, you know. Big room with fine exposure. Great American-family-sized beds for supreme comfort. Get very happy sleep. Well, boys, I can be chummy up to a point, but this is ridiculous. But for Mr. Red Fox, a private room, fitting for commander of expedition. Nice joint you got here, Yoshida. When I get back to Washington, I'll tell the president all about it. No, no, no, no, please. This room is booked for soon coming honeymoon couple. Yes, I see by the vase of flowers. Cherry blossoms, aren't they? Artificial, but nice sentiment. Yes, it is. Uh, Hotel Okamoto wishes your mission success. If you need help with secret spy work, call on Yoshida. Just consider yourself one of us, Yoshida-san. Bountiful thanks. And you will not be disappointed. I was once house detective. (speaks Japanese) Grab a mattress and sleep on the floor, Chatfield. You won't catch cold. How could I? I brought my silk sheets with me. (whistling tune) Well, I got a phone call through and struck gold. You did? Where? No place you could cut it. This is a hideout deal. And you leave big footprints. You know, there's something crummy about you, Waller. Look who's talking. You ain't no angel, McCaffrey. No, I'm not, but I don't hide nothing. My hands are always on the table in plain sight. But not yours. I get the feeling they're kind of dirty. You know, if you wasn't apt to be my sergeant, I'd flatten you. Well, come on, chicken, I'm still a private. Now, come on, fellas, cut it out! The matter with you? We're gonna have some fun, huh? What's the matter? Thanks, Skip. I-I got to be careful and get that promotion. Yeah, that promotion. But you're not very happy about it, are you? (chuckles) No, it just won't be the same old happy life. Well, I wish I could help you, but who am I to challenge destiny? Hey, Newt, what's the score with you? When's the wedding? I gave the clerk her address and we looked up the phone number, but she's moved. My nerves are jumpy, Skip. I think I'll get me one of them baths, let one of them cuties give me a massage. Why don't you fellas go up, keep an eye on him. He's liable to start massaging those cuties himself. I think you got something there, Skip. Well, this mattress is no good without a pillow. Poor old McCaffrey. What do you mean? Uh, I should've let him put Waller in the hospital and lose his promotion. He'd be happier, I'd be happier. We'd all be happier. Maybe he'd even take it easier on you. Yeah, I know what you mean. I guess the man wasn't born for responsibilities and restraints. Only when the guns are firing. When McCaffrey's on furlough, he just doesn't fit in. You know, I'd almost be willing to see him wreck this joint just to save him the misery of that promotion. Well, I'll see you at the baths, huh? Yeah, I'll be right up. I, uh, just want to catch up on my correspondence with Mother. Private McCaffrey, Hotel Okamoto. -(child giggles) -Hello there. Hey, what am I offered here?! (speaking Japanese) Yeah, I'll take anything you got. (laughs) Letter for Private McCaffrey, requesting quick delivery. Red Fox McCaffrey, that's me. Who'd know I'm here, Skip? Well, we had to leave a temporary address at the air station. Yeah, maybe it's something about my promotion. Uh, my hands are wet, honey. Read it to me, if you savvy the lingo. Um, "Dear Desmond." -Desmond! -(excited chatter, laughter) Well, I think that'll sound rather dashing, Sergeant Desmond McCaffrey. -(laughter) -Nobody ever calls me that name. Somebody must have been looking in the files. Desmond! (whooping) "Dear Desmond, for a long time, I have wished to express "my secret admiration for you. "I withheld the impulse, "fearing that the deep emotion you inspire in me might be "misunderstood by a person less sensitive than you and I. -(men whooping, laughing) -"At last, however, "when I saw you here, revealed in all your masculine Greek god magnificence..." (laughter, whistling) Where'd that letter come from? I found it on the reception desk. Perhaps a lady in the women's bath took an admiring peek. No, some crumb-bum in here wrote it. I got a notion to wreck this joint! You got the right idea, Mac. I'd make a United Nations case out of this. Wait, read some more, honey. I'll get a clue to who I'm gonna murder. "I fled to the retiring room and penned this missive, "which I hope you will never discuss with your coarse and vulgar associates." -Whoops. -All right, Skip, who's been out of here? Who's been out of here long enough to write that junk? Gee, I don't know, Desmond. I guess I was too relaxed. You keep reading, honey; we'll look for a clue. "But for the present, I must remain anonymous, "dreading that you may think ill of me, "languishing for some future moment when I can look "into your great, blue eyes and know the true poetic tenderness that you conceal beneath your gruff exterior." -(laughter) Poetic, huh? Tender, huh? How's it signed? "Lonesome." (laughter, whooping, whistling) All right, I'll find that joker! -I'll knock that lollypop off his stick! -Attaboy. What kind of a joint are you running here? I'll rip this place wide open. It'll take all the plumbers in Japan to put it together again! Now you're talking, buddy! (laughs) Wait a minute. Why didn't I think of this before? Think of what before? I got it now. It was one of these cuties in here wrote it. Did you girlies go to school and learn your English real good, huh? Or maybe you were right, honey. Maybe some dame did take a peek in here and remembers me from my last trip to this burg. (laughs) Sure, I'm always blowing my stack without analyzing things. (chuckles) Hey, honey, you've been scrubbing me real nice. -Let me scrub you. -(woman shrieks) (laughter) (playful shouting) Uh, miss, bring me a bottle of cognac. I'm expecting a lady friend. -Cognac. Cognac. -Fine. Cognac. Okay? Yeah. -Thank you very much. -That's all. Hi, lover boy. Hi-ya, kid. You've been on my mind ever since Honolulu. (chuckles) Oh. Mm. I managed to get away for a little while, but I got to be back pretty soon. What is this, always having to get back to somebody? The same way in Honolulu. I've been wondering about you. You just keep on wondering, big boy. Maybe that'll keep you interested. Stop bugging me. What's with you, anyhow? Why don't you have me up to your place? My place is anywhere we get together. You know what I mean-- your home. (laughs) Social climber, huh? Mm-hmm. Okay, you got an invitation for tonight. I'll leave the back door unlocked. You big ape. Why do I take these chances for you? You know why. Yep, I guess I do. Oh, uh, no, miss. (speaking Japanese) (speaking Japanese) Come on, baby. Uh-huh. Let's go. * What is the soldier's pleasure? Well, I ain't feeling much pleasure, miss, but I'd be obliged to learn where Grace Blake has moved to. I used to write her at this number. Grace, did you say? Are you by any chance her brother? Uh, no, ma'am, I'm her feller. We're gonna get married. I believe Grace did mention something, that she had some sort of a misalliance with an American Marine. Well, no, ma'am, we didn't mess around none. Oh, she was one girl I sure respected. Come into the parlor. I'll see what information I have about her. Here we are. Blake, Grace. Brunette, age 28. Height: five-foot-six. Excellent figure, lady-like manners. Yeah, and to think a lady like Grace had to live in a Japanese prison camp. We won't discuss that. I'm sorry, she didn't leave a forwarding address. Well, this is a terrible disappointment to me. See, ever since I left Texas, I've been dreaming about somehow getting to Japan, and-and instead I landed straight into Busan, Korea. Well, I have a wide social acquaintance in this city. There are any number of nice girls to whom I could introduce you. Sit down, won't you? No, ma'am. Thanking you all the same, but I ain't feeling so hot. Ah, youth-- its broken hearts can be quickly mended. Sit down and tell me about your exciting young life. You're a Marine I see. Your pay amounts to a great deal in Japanese yen. You are a lucky boy, really. Money is only a little material thing, and yet it compensates for many sorrows. I spent my last pay two months before I got it. How naughty of you. You are a prodigal, perhaps because your pay is only a trifle to you. I believe you mentioned being from Texas, that great, rich American state of oil, cattle and millionaires. Yes'm, but my folks are only poor cotton sharecroppers. Really? That is most unfortunate. Well, I hope I haven't detained you too long. And life ticks away so fast, doesn't it? Not a precious moment should be wasted. -(phone ringing) -Good-bye. Yes? Oh, doggone, my bad luck's got me so loco, I don't even know where I'm going. Maybe your luck change now, solider boy. Me, Su Me Sagita. Me, Sio Sagita. Me, Toyo Sagita. We all three sisters. He pretty nice. Nice for Marine. Big dreamy-eyed boy. Sagita sisters share everything with each other. Yeah, where we going? To Yokosuka Gaiety Club. No, no, I wouldn't do you no good there. -I got bad troubles. -Aw. But there's some buddies of mine who are raring to go. They've been counting on me for something like this. If you're all gonna be at the Gaiety tonight, I'll bring them on over. -Happy times! -(giggling) We keep honorable get-together. -Sayonara. -Sayonara. Sayonara. (chuckles) That dumb little cookie that wrote this, Gus-- why didn't she tell me to my face she's nuts about me? I ain't hard to talk to. Yeah, I wonder if she's got a girlfriend. What if she has? What do we do? Invite them up here for a dinner of sea rations? Wouldn't that make a swell impression. More dames out there in the Ginza than snowballs in Alaska, all just itching to make my acquaintance, if I had a little scratch in my pocket. And with all due respect to that Greek god physique of yours, let's not underestimate the power of a little money. Ah, why'd I bother to take a bath anyway? From the look on your kisser, I guess you didn't catch up with that broad of yours. She's a lady, and don't you be calling her a broad. You never seen a lady till you've seen that broad of mine. I've seen the place where she used to live. It's a real nice boarding house run by a real lady. The last thing I'm looking for is room and board. What else you got to report? Su Me, Toyo, Sio. Cut the Japanese lingo. Don't try to cover up you blew your mission, Levells. But I didn't; that's their names. Three of the cutest little bunnies you ever seen. Yeah? Family type, not gold diggers? Well, I'm afraid this ain't exactly Lin Leese. They seem to know their way around. They said to meet them at the Gaiety Club tonight. The Gaiety Club? Why, coffee's a buck a cup there, and we're so broke, we're eating kettle rations. And now, gentlemen, I am going down to the lobby, and I'm gonna hit old "Ahso" for about 200 bucks worth of yen. Oh, come on, you'll have this whole hotel down on our heads. That's what they said to the guy who built the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Just take it easy, Skip. We got to remember tomorrow. Mac, will you relax? I have just gotten a scheme that is so brilliant that it took me five minutes to think of it. Look... Boy, that Marine is a genius. You give him a Rock Island timetable and an Ingersoll watch, and I bet he'd be president of the road in 20 minutes. (speaking Japanese) That is honeymoon couple I mentioned. Ah, so. -Fine, young people. -Oh, yes, sirree. But cannot rent a room in respectable hotel to show marriage certificate. Well, naturally. It certainly is a comfort, Yoshida-san, to know that we're in such incorruptible surroundings. It, uh, sort of lightens my other cares. What's the matter? Is Red Fox operation not proceeding as planned? No, no, not quite. Has headquarters phoned us? -No call from Blue Boy. -No call from Blue Boy? Well, there's just too much red tape. They're all tangled up in it. When I get back to my desk in Washington, there'll be some fur flying, I can tell you. Blue Boy, Blue Boy, Blue Boy. Red Fox calling Blue Boy. Come in. This is Blue Boy. Come in, Red Fox. Over. Uh, Captain Sampson said, uh-uh-uh, Blue Boy, sir, uh, we left you in such a hurry that, uh, we forgot to pick up our expense money. Over. A very understandable oversight, Red Fox, but we have no messenger available at the moment. Tell you what you do. Have the management of the hotel advance you the equivalent of $200 in yen. $200-- that is very much yen! I heard that. Who was it, the manager? Put him on. Uh, since you're one of us, Yoshida-san, I feel free to divulge that, uh, Blue Boy is none other than Chester Sampson, the captain in charge of our military police here in Yokosuka. And I can assure you that, uh, Chet will reimburse you for any money advance, no matter the amount. (speaking Japanese) Over. (speaking Japanese over radio) Uh, don't be alarmed. That's merely the, uh, staff interpreter. (speaking Japanese) Very well, very well. Extremely proud to help. Oh. Everything all over. (laughs) Oh, thank you, Yoshida-san. (speaking Japanese) Uh, just for, uh, incidental expenses, huh? Say, by the way, what was it the, uh, captain's interpreter said to you? He say, "Cooperate or Uncle Sammy will cut off reconstruction funds." My hotel would lose thousands of dollars. (over radio): Now, don't you worry Yoshida-san. Captain Sampson's heart is as big as Mount Fujiyama. He'll back you win or lose. Perkins! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now, that's better. I'm heartened by your response. You do know your name. I was about convinced that everybody around here belonged in a psycho ward. Yes, sir, I'm-I'm afraid you're right. Here's the latest I picked up on Red Fox. And Blue Boy? Yes, sir. Blue Boy is supposed to be a captain. They're still chattering all over the place, and now a couple of Japanese are getting into the act. Blue Boy says to Red Fox, "Have your hotel manager loan you $200, and he'll guarantee payment." Very generous fellow this Blue Boy. Oh, very, sir. The 200 was only a starter. Pretty soon, it got up to thousands. Did you gather who this philanthropist might be? Speak plainly, Perkins. Who is Blue Boy supposed to be? You, sir. Get me Intelligence. The place we planned to spend our honeymoon when you were called away. It's just as lovely as I imagined it would be. Not a care in the world this time, darling. Just you and me and the little cooing doves. Welcome. Wait a minute. This looks like a old Army game again. Don't tell me we're not going to get in. Well, young woman can get in and you can get in, but not together. Now, see here, we're a perfectly decent married couple. Well, wedding ring is very applicable for present situation, but a marriage certificate is more convincing. Now, look here, Charlie, we been married two years. I don't carry a marriage certificate around in my duffle bag. Well, here, this is who I am-- Marine Gunnery Sergeant Howard Hawkins. What else do you want to see, my good behavior medal? I tell you, I'm his wife. His wife. (horn honks) (speaking Japanese excitedly) (speaking Japanese excitedly) Honey, you understand Japanese. What is he saying? Your men have acquired a lot of money and are going on a bender at the Gaiety Club. What I'd like to know is: what's that got to do with us? It's just one of those things, honey, I've got to straighten out. Two years a bride, but never a wife. Ah, so, now truth come out in the wash. Baby, I just got to look after them. Talk to the man in Japanese and get us a nice room, and I'll be right back. * * Two bottles bourbon, two bottles gin, one bottle of rum and a case of beer for chasers. And some scotch. And some scotch for my buddy. They all look good to me. They all look alike to me. Which three did you pick out, Newt? I don't know. I can't spot them. (applause) There they are; that's them. * Good scouting, buddy boy. You could get rich running a lonesome heart's club. * (applause) (whistling) * * (whooping, cheering) (music ends) Levells, get backstage on the double and get them out here for a drink, along with any other little knick-knacks you might run into. Skip, order us some champagne. Champagne? You never used to go for that fancy stuff. Yes, I did, every time I got promoted. Well, you're not promoted yet this time, and I've been hoping it won't happen. Boy, you're getting a hopelessly split personality. That's jealousy talking, buddy. No, it isn't jealously. Just wouldn't appreciate my type of genius. That's why I've been avoiding promotion. Believe me, you'd be a lot happier if you avoided it, too. (speaking Japanese) Uh, me friend of, uh, three sisters. Uh, sisters. (speaking Japanese) Grace? (speaking Japanese) Grace? Grace? (car drives off) What's the matter, jughead?! Haven't you got any manners?! Oh, begging your pardon, but you don't look like any etiquette expert to me. Looks like we'll have to run a red Chinese through this dump to fumigate it after this sea crab gets through smelling it up. Well, I guess that's gonna call for a little lashing. -Who's first? -Go get him. Take your best shot, Marine. Come on, what are you gonna do? We got to be careful, Skip. I got to remember tomorrow. On your way, sailor, on your way. Our dear Desmond abhors violence. Navy's landing, boys. Situation well in hand. How do you like that? They're even stealing our slogan. Yeah, but we got to be careful. We got to remember tomorrow. But, Skip, I know it was a tough pill to swallow, -but I can't go... -But, but, but, but what? Boy, you've hit a new low. I'm telling you, you keep this up, you can go to Demark and get one of those operations they do, and when you come back, we'll call you Peaches. Pardon me while I wash my hands of you, cutie. Well, boys, have fun. I got a man's job to do tonight. Never trust a guy that keeps his lip buttoned like that one. Yeah, he's an oddball, all right. Give him a couple of whiffs of cheap perfume on some chesty broad, and he'll go right over the hill. Hey, baby, wait a minute. (whistles) That gentleman there... ...with the bottle... (chugging) you take. I go. You come, right? Wonder what happened to Levells with those, uh, three chicks? Ah, who cares? I'm too ashamed to even face it. They might have went back there and got the birdie from that sailor. Just consider the source. "Just consider the source." What's that? How should I know? (laughs) -Hmm? -It's another load of mush from that Miss Peekaboo at the bathhouse. Listen. "My Desmond, I have counted the lonely hours "since my last missive to you. (laughs) "Your gorgeous image continues to float before my eyes, "that tawny ripple of muscles "like the waves which softly kiss the golden sands. -(laughs) -Got a real seafaring flavor to it. Yeah, she's pretty salty, huh? "A short while ago, I passed close by you and was tempted to touch you." She's here somewhere! Hey. I got a hunch that note's a rib from that sailor over there. Hey, bellhops, have fun. Nah, only a broad could get this poetical. Listen. "So perhaps the time draws near "when we shall meet in breathless rendezvous, "alone in some exotic bower beside the sea. (laughs) Yours forever to be." How's it signed this time? "S-Sea Nymph." (laughs) Sea Nymph, all that nautical talk. Let me see that thing. This is undeniably a man's handwriting. Look at it. Yeah, well, it does look like maybe some guy wrote it. Yeah, yeah, now I get the picture. The locker room, the baths-- I saw that same sailor in the locker room. -That guy? -Yeah. Why, that crumb. Yeah, crumb. Well, wait a minute, how did he know my name was Desmond until you just mentioned it a couple of minutes ago? Well, he-he could've been on some transport with you somewhere. -Go get him. -Yeah, he remembers me. He's trying to get even, huh? Well, sure. Are you gonna let him get away with this thing? Go get him! Break up the joint! Ah, wait a minute. I can get him anytime. I want to have some fun tonight, Skip. What happened to Levells with those three chicks? -(applause, fanfare plays) -Nothing ever gets done around here unless I do it myself. (upbeat jazz music playing) I give up. I give up! Ought to retire and become a scoutmaster. Listen, Skip, I hope he becomes a general. The further it takes him away from me, the better I like it. (speaking Japanese) ...uh, three little pussycats. Ah? Pussycats, three. (speaking Japanese) (women giggling) On your feet, Sea Nymph. I've got a love letter here for you. Get lost, Desmond. You don't want to make me mad. Oh, you're a tough guy, huh? Yeah. Well, you don't fool me, buddy, using these three girlies to cover up. Buster, what have you been smoking? I don't read you. -Oh, you don't, huh? -No. Well, don't you like my gorgeous image? Are you still counting the lonely hours, or are your waves too busy kissing the golden sands? (grunts) I don't take that kind of talk from nobody. Oh, come on, sailor boy. Don't play foxy with me. We read each other now, don't we, huh? You tipped yourself off when you waved nighty-night at me with your limp wrist, daffodil! -Daffodil? -Daffodil! -Limp wrist?! -Limp wrist! I've killed guys for less than that. (women gasping) Come on, cowpoke, get up and fight. Yeah, put it right here, right here. See what you can do, come on. Right there, come on. Right... Come on, get up, will you? Come on. Come on. Come on. (women shrieking) MAN: Go on, baby, hit him! (cheering) (clamoring) (women shrieking) -We send you in there! -Oh! Look, you hide me, and if I get out of this, I'll marry you. -(women giggle) -Get under the table! (women clamoring) Hide him! Looks like he gave us the slip. (chuckles) All right, McCaffrey, let's go. (groans) Well, I guess it's just as well you found me here. I can show you more hospitality than I could've in our old hometown. So many of these little luxuries were frowned on there. What's yours, Newt? Bourbon? Or I have some sake if you want to go the Oriental route. I don't want anything. Well, here's to the age of innocence, Newt. The old days back home. That-that man I seen you with tonight-- who was he? Who knows? Who cares? Yeah, but what about all the letters you wrote me? They sounded just like you used to be. I was preserving you, Newt, as a hope of last resort. A dream of a day when I might kick this all off and come home to the poor but pious respectability -of being Mrs. Newton Level. -(phone ringing) But you had to find me like this, didn't you? That was a pretty shoddy trick of fate. But what does it matter? I probably never would have gone home anyway. Yes? Yes, I remember. Where are you? All right. It'll take me about 15 minutes. I have to change. Bye. See you. Newt, you better pour yourself a drink. I'm going to tell you a few facts about life in a Japanese prison camp. It was nothing at all like I wrote you. A bit rough at first, especially when mother died. But after that, the commanding officer took a fancy to me and moved me to better quarters. And then... there were other officers, of course. And finally, that quaint little country girl named Grace was only a far-gone memory. Oh, yes, it seems that nature so favored me, there wasn't even any more prison camp for me. I was moved to a higher echelon of comforts in Tokyo. And then, when our American conquerors arrived, I suffered no obvious hardships. That, of course, is why I moved to Yokosuka, to be near the larger base of operations. For as you know, their... generosity and their affection is legendary. And you know something else, Newt? I'm with it. You'll get a good, long stretch in the brig, McCaffrey. I'm preparing my report to your commanding officer. Gunnery Sergeant Hawkins will be the chief witness against you. Right, sir. He was up for promotion, but of course that's a dead issue now. I've been watching you ever since Guadalcanal, through Iwo Jima and Okinawa to the landings of Inchon. And I've never seen a better fighting man or a more troublesome citizen. I'm sorry, sir, but like I always say, furloughs is my worst enemy. There's such a thing as battle fatigue. Doesn't that bother you? No, sir, just furlough fatigue. For a long time, I've shared the delusion with Gunny Hawkins and others that there might be noncommissioned officer material in you. Although, you never were quite my idea of the all-American boy. In the well-rounded Marine, the guts to storm an enemy position is essential, but that isn't the only requirement. He must reflect credit on the service in the public walks of life. I realize that, sir. However, you won't be deprived of your medal. You won that before your trip to Japan. I understand your commanding officer has requested these decorations be presented here. Yes, sir, Captain. And it will soon be time for the formation. Well, then you'd better be on your way. And get that hangdog look off your face, McCaffrey. At least you've earned this chance to be proud. March out, McCaffrey! * Thank you, sir. Gunny, you don't figure they'll carry this -as far as a court-martial? -How should I know? You've been in trouble before; you ought to be an expert on these things by this time. Yeah, well, my intentions are always good. There's an old saw that says the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Meanwhile, the provost marshal is allowing you to remain on technical liberty. So be careful, Let's Go, and don't dig yourself in any deeper. Or let me put it this way. I've never had a real honeymoon, so do me the personal favor of allowing me to spend a few hours with my wife. Hey, come on, buddy, let's shove off. Time's a-wasting. Well, that's all over, Ellen. Let's shove out of here and have a real honeymoon. Our marriage certificate. Why'd you dig that up? Just to jam it down the throat of that stuffy proprietor at the White Dove. I'm going to make him let us in, even without our suitcase. Attagirl, Ellen, you tell him off. All right, where's the driver for this heap? -Let's go! -(horn blaring) Sorry to hear it, Mac. Looks like you lost your promotion. Yeah, it's a load off my mind even if does mean the brig. Well, it's made him a real buddy again. Frankly, I haven't been so delighted since that widow in Manila named the twins McCaffrey. Well, that's the motto of the McCaffrey club, isn't it? All for one and one for all? Don't be a wise guy, Chatfield. All right, you guys, come on now, ante up. We got to pay that hotel bill while we still got some dough. Speaking of dough, where I'm going, I don't need it. -So long, boys. -Okay, yeah. Boy, he's still talking like a gyrene that's about to go over the hill. Pete, you better bird-dog him. -Okay. -Yeah, Pete. I promised Gunny no more foul-ups. Now we're gonna leave this truck at the hotel. I'd appreciate it if you'd do a little cruising tonight -and keep an eye on the guys. -I'll have a guy on the Red Fox shortwave in case you need us. Right-o. Where you going, you Plymouth Rock capon? Why, just so I shan't disappoint you, McCaffrey, I thought I'd go to the blood bank to see if mine's still blue. Very funny. Snap out of it, Levells. Keep looking for that broad; you'll find her yet. I found her. What a bunch I got here-- busted Romeos, free lovers, financials wizards, and that cutie Chatfield who come over on the Mayflower. To say nothing of the big balloon brain who keeps us all in a jam. Come on, give me some dough. Yeah, well, no more. I've had it, boy. -No more pub-crawling for your uncle Mac. -Oh? Just a nice quiet evening at home with a nice family. You mean those, uh, Sagita sisters from the, uh, Gaiety Club? (laughs) You guess good. Oh, I can see it all now. Just them and you and me sitting around with our shoes off, drinking tea. Not you, buster. Go shoot your own quail. You'll miss me; I'm the life of every party. Like you were in Honolulu? Telling every ugly broad on Waikiki Beach that you were me? (laughs) My phone never stopped ringing. Oh. But seeing what a fall guy you made out of me, -I'll let you get yourself on the hook. -Hmm? -I'll give you a buildup. -Hmm? They want to get married. Oh, no, thanks. I'll do my own selling. Okay, write them a note, and I'll deliver it and tell them how great you are. And if they want you aboard, I'll give you a buzz at the hotel. But right now, buddy, I'm gonna make a date for yours truly. Ahso. Ha, ha. Hey, Boy-san, psst, come here. You got the writer paper? Write-oh? (speaks Japanese) (speaking Japanese) Hello. Uh, which one is this? Oh, Su Me. Hello, baby. This is big, handsome Marine boy, remember? Oh, big, handsome under table boy? No show tonight. You come here, our house. Okay, baby, will do. Start cooking up the tea and the sake, and I'll be right over as soon as I can change my socks. Sayonara, baby. (kisses) (whistling tune) Give this to those three dollies. That note will get me in anywhere. -(laughs) -(engine starts) Go. SONG DO: "My dear one, I'm happy that you are away from danger, "though my heart cries out for you. "Each day, I stand looking across the torn land "where I first saw you, "and I try to dream that you are there. "But it is strangely empty now, "and there is a great and frightening stillness, "as though the world were catching its breath "to make again the fire and thunder "more terrible than before. "And so I fall at the Lotus throne "and pray that my visions of terror are false, "that there will be life and peace "and the nirvana of our love forever. (playing melody) "Then suddenly again, I'm filled with the faith that sings in my heart to the happy music of the komungo." (melody continues) * (speaking Japanese) (laughter) Marine boy very good with Japanese custom. (laughs) You can say that again, baby. We're gonna have quite a night tonight, huh? (laughs) (speaking Japanese) (laughs) (speaking Japanese) Our bother, Fuji. -Brother? -Yes. We're proud of him. He's a wrestler, champion of all Japan. (speaking Japanese) (conversation continues in Japanese) Did I? Yeah, that's... Oh, yeah, I did. (chuckles) Uh, uh, Su Me, Su Me! Yeah. (speaking Japanese) Sake? Yeah, I could use one. You got one? (women giggling) Trophies of brother Fuji, all for victory in many festivals. Gold samurai sword presented by the government for breaking neck of Chinese champion. (both laugh) (speaking Japanese) (women speaking Japanese) (women giggling) Have a nice, big home in America? Yeah, yeah, Camp Pendleton. (women giggling) Well, this is quite a setup you got here, Fuji. Uh, wrestling racket must be pretty good here. (laughter) Here, have a cigar, Fuji. Old man Churchill sends me a box of those every Christmas. We're buddies. (laughs) (sighs) Fuji, how would you like to have another American for a brother-in-law? He's not as good-looking as I am, but he's got a lot of money. He's got a big estate called Fort Knox. (speaking Japanese) But, you see, he's a little shy. He likes to send in his references first, see, so he don't get his feelings hurt if he ain't welcome. Uh, dig this. "Most lovely and illustrious flowers of Nippon, you are the blinding beauty in the secret garden of my heart." (speaking Japanese) Yeah, he really hates himself, doesn't he? Uh, dig this. "I pine to make your acquaintance "and hope the following qualifications "may strike a note of-of response in you. I have often been referred to as the Greek god type." "Greek god type." I've heard that one before. He make nice word music. Yeah, honey, but I got a hunch this guy's only got one tune. "However, if it is the higher ideal of manhood which you seek, "gentile of manners, profound of mind, "and with the rippling muscles like the waves which kiss the golden sands..." "Rippling muscles." "Golden sands." "...then I shall feed your heart's desire "in some breathless rendezvous with only the pale moon to spy upon us." Rippling muscles, huh? Golden sands. That's it. He's the Sea Nymph. Where's the telephone? In trophy room. When I go to America, I bring whole family. Hotel Okamoto. R-Red Fox headquarters. Skip, this you? Hey, listen, buddy, I don't know what you wrote in that letter, but you sure hit the jackpot. Get over here on the double. It's 318, just around the corner from the hotel. And, listen, the door's open. Walk right in. Okay? See you, buddy. (whistling quietly) Yeah. Well, folks, I got bad news for you. -The wedding's all off. -(speaking Japanese) My buddy just tipped me off on the phone that the provost marshal's on his way over here to arrest me. For fighting in club last night? Yeah, that's right. Just when I thought I had it all squared away, too. And then this copper, he frames me just because we had an argument about the wrestling racket. (speaking Japanese) That's what I told him, Fuji. Naturally, your name came up, and that's when I chewed him out for calling you a big phony. (speaking Japanese) (grunts) (speaking Japanese) That's right, Fuji. Give him the full treatment! Rip, bam, wham! (speaking Japanese) SKIP: Hey, McCaffrey! (grunts) What's he doing? Getting ready to break neck of your enemy. Hey, McCaffrey! Hey, Mac! Ahso. Uh, hi there. (laughs) Uh, uh... Roth! Uh, Roth, my name. Uh, U.S. Marine Corps. Glad to meet you. I seemed to have, uh, stumbled into the little old wrong doorway here. I guess I'll be going now. Uh, uh... Good night. Um, so sorry. (yells) -Hey, now, look, you got the wrong idea, buddy! -(grunts) Hey, now, let's talk this over, bud. Let's get to know each other. I mean... -(grunts) -(screams) Now, wait a minute, buster! I don't want to lose my temper. -I don't want to have to hurt you. -(yells) Hey, McCaffrey, this guy is gonna kill me! (laughter, shouting) Get him, Fuji! (laughter, shouting continue) Don't forget your shoes, Roth! (laughter) No more trouble. We have wedding soon. Yeah, yeah, uh... (chuckles) I think I'll go get the license, honey. (laughter) (laughs) * Frisk him. Come on, honey, let's dance. I don't want to dance. Come on. (laughing) Poor Skip. Give me the pass key. I lost mine. -Yes, sir. -(laughing) Ah, Mr. Red Fox employee create system. Very good. Yeah, I'm using my old noodle tonight, Yoshida. (laughs) Mr. Red Fox very clever. Smart as famous Japanese detective, Mr. Moto. Have nose like bloodhound dog, huh? (burps) (shouts in Japanese) (shrieking) (shouting in Japanese) You demented baboon! What are you, nuts, trying to get me killed?! Oh, that'd be a big loss to the art world, wouldn't it, you privy poet? What are you talking about? "Greek god." (laughs) "Kissing the golden sands." (laughs) "With only the pale moon to spy on you." -(laughs) -You dirty, double-dealing, Sea Nymph! (laughs) Okay, okay. You can't even take a joke. You had to set a hired bone-crusher on me, huh? Well, let me tell you this, buster, I finally caught up with that Oriental tub of lard, and I laid him out flat. Ha! Tell me another fairy tale. Okay, come on, that does it! Hey, McCaffrey, Blue Boy's calling Red Fox, and it sounds like an S.O.S. Hello, Blue Boy. This is Red Fox. Over. (over radio): I hear you, Red Fox. Listen. Newt's been nicked and they're all at the All Nations. We've been trying to get his money back, but we met heavy enemy resistance. Over. The All Nations, you say? Griff Plummer's joint? Yes. We need reinforcements on the double. Reinforcements on the way. Out. -All right, get your gear. Let's go. -Right. So the keeper of the White Dove wouldn't go for our wedding certificate. Well, this is my idea of a honeymoon heaven. The chief didn't even ask us to register. Well, you talk like you've had experience in such matters. Always glad to have Marine boy back again. He don't know what he's talking about. I've never been here before. So sorry, so sorry. Much apology. Have room key. Boy, these guys, I don't know. They see one guy in uniform, and then every guy they see is the same guy. On my word of honor, I've never been here before. (speaking Japanese) What's he saying? They're in trouble again. They've left the hotel with a walkie-talkie. Where are they? (speaking Japanese) Right off Takari Street on the Ginza. Tell him to go find them and then call me at headquarters. I'm sorry, Ellen, I'll be right back. (speaking Japanese) (sighs) * Hold it. This place is out of bounds for you fellas. Beat it. How do you like that, Pete? (women shrieking) Go to sleep, you bum. Hey, McCaffrey! Take it easy, Mac. Long time, no see, Plummer. Not since New Zealand when I knocked your brains out. Oh, you got lucky. Get out of here before I call the MPs. You'll call the MPs? Why, you big, cheap, jugheaded louse. Headquarters, headquarters, Blue Boy, Blue Boy. Red Fox calling Blue Boy. (over radio): This is Blue Boy at headquarters. Proceed, Red Fox. Say, Captain, we're in a clip joint down here. The place looks like a nest of red female spies. They knocked down one of our men with cheap liquor and rolled him. Over. Select some good samples, and I'll run them through the lab. And pick up the suspects. Bring them in, and I'll interrogate them personally. Over. Will do, Captain. Out. L-Look, you guys, I-I got real 90-proof here. -Yeah. -Leave me alone, I'll give you some. Okay, we'll take a couple of cases of scotch, a couple of cases of bourbon and some gin. And if it checks up all right, we won't put you off-limits, Plummer! Pete, go with him! All right, you in the gold dress, and you, and you, Red! Come on, all of you! You're all under arrest. That's good intelligence, McCaffrey; they all look guilty. And we'll take that jukebox, too. That looks like it might have a few hidden documents in it. -Come on, out! -All right, ladies. Come on. Let's move along now. -Out, out, out! -Come on, here we go. Captain, sir. Red Fox again? Yes, sir, Blue Boy, sir-- I mean, Captain Sampson, sir. Self-control, Perkins, self-control. Don't break down. Look at me. I'm doing fine! Yes, sir. But wait till you hear the latest. They've just raided a nest of spies. What's that? Someone going over my head? Oh, no, sir. They say you're gonna test the liquor and personally inspect some females. You don't believe that, do you, Perkins? Oh, no, sir. Oh, yes, you do. How long has it been since you've had a good rest? Captain, my last leave was over a year ago, but I'm all right. I-I'm all right. That is, I think I'm all right. Captain Sampson, sir. I just received a telephone call, and I believe it's the answer to the problem he's discussing. (men murmuring) -You okay? -* Oh, when the saints * Go marching in -No, no, no. -* Oh, when the... Extreme purities, motto of Hotel Okamoto. Woman characters very shady-looking. Cannot permit. Oh, now don't blow your cork, Yoshida, till you hear the good news. Tonight's a night that'll go down in the history of Japan. We wrapped up the spy ring. -Spies, woman species? -(speaks Japanese) Yeah, they're the most dangerous kind. All right, Skip, take them upstairs and interrogate them and search them. Come on. Go. Congratulations! Congratulation to me? You're an honorary member of our successful mission. Ah, delightful honor to be member of intelligence secret service. Yeah, and it's an all-American custom to throw a victory ball. Now, bring all your friends, okay? Our party is your party, okay? -Yes. -Okay? -Okay. -Okay. (bottles clinking) (siren wailing) (laughter, excited chatter) Hey, hold it, hey! Pipe down! Quiet it down! Hey, hey, everybody! Hey, hold it! -Pipe down, Skip. -What? -(chatter quiets) -Hmm. I want to give a toast. Here's to the wonderful... wonderful, uh... Wonderful friendship between America and Japan. Yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah. And also to Yoshida, who made our wonderful stay so wonderful in his family hotel. -Yoshida. -(cheering) That boy, Yoshida... Hey, al-also, also, to this wonderful honeymoon couple, who-who I'm sorry hadn't much chance to get acquainted! (laughter) Mac, that was wonderful. -(laughs): Yeah. -Now, can all this noise and let's get down to some serious drinking here. Yeah, drink up! Drink up! (laughter, excited chatter) (whooping) I tear up remainder of hotel bill, in name of international goodwill. (cheering) Yoshida! Mr. Moto! -Wonderful! -A very gentlemanly thing to do! -Hey! -I want you to know that we appreciate it. Let's have some music. Let's have some music. -Yeah, play... -Pete, put some more yen in the jukebox. Play "My Melancholy Geisha." (laughter) -(upbeat music playing) -(excited chatter continues) -Here we go, here we go! -(rhythmic clapping) Do-si-do! Hey! Come on. Yee-haw! Come on! (whooping, laughter) (music continues inside) (excited chatter continues) Swing it, baby! Yeah! Come on, McCaffrey. -(music stops) -(shrieks) So it's Red Fox McCaffrey and Blue Boy Roth. I should have known. (laughs) Look, Captain, I'm sure I can explain... You can do your explaining at a court-martial. Well, in a very few words... Shut up, you barracks Confucius. -Uh... -And you needn't even bother to bring your gear along, McCaffrey. By the time you get out of the brig, your uniform will be out of style. You make serious mistake. Mr. Red Fox capture these Mata Hari spy girls. Mata Hari hookers. Lock these men up, and let's get some sleep. Report to headquarters. Tell them to secure the rest of the patrols that are out on this operation. Yes, sir. Diamond, Diamond, this is Diamond Six. Over. (over radio): Get off the air. This is a priority message. All leaves of the U.S. Armed Services are canceled. All officers and men report immediately to your base. This is an alert from the supreme command. It looks as though these men may be shipped out, and that's a break for the peace and quiet of Yokosuka. Take your men with you, Gunny. My report will follow them -back to the division. -Aye-aye, sir. -Okay, let's go! -(clamoring) Let's go! (speaking Japanese) All right, come on, you guys, move! Let's go, on the double! Let's go, come on! Where's Waller? I got him spotted and he's close by. Okay, let's go get him. All very confusing! Please come back again, solider boy! -Going over the hill, Waller? -Don't let them stop us, Russ. What do you mean, don't let him? He's got the gang with him, -and there's only one of me. -That would save you from making your own decision, wouldn't it? But you're gonna have to make it by yourself. I'm not a cop; neither is any of those men. The provost will put out a tracer on you, but still you might get away. Come on, Russ, let's go. Sure, who else but you would want a bilge rat? Take his decorations in the morning, then go over the side at night. Well, not me, not my platoon. You've got him, and he's right for you. Well, that's all I stopped by for, Waller, just to give you a load on how I feel about you. Wait a minute, Sarge. Don't be an imbecile, Russ. Can't you see what he's trying to do? He's trying to get you to swallow the bait, hook and all. You keep out of this. Well, so long, Waller. Remember what I told you, and live with it. -Hold it, Gunny! -Russ! Sayonara, tramp! * * * Okay, McCaffrey, you and your men make that patrol to the right front like I briefed you. Let's go! If you guys can find a better hole, get to it. Missed us again, Navy! That's better, sailor boy! Keep trying, you'll hit us yet, you dummy! Who you calling dummy? Who was it that kept hollering, "Let's go," when we got lost from Gunny and the rest of the squad, huh? What do you expect on recon patrol, tourist maps? That joker on the guns thinks he's ranging in on a nest of red goons. Well, we're about a mile inside the Chinese lines. I suppose that's a big laugh, huh, genius? Well, that's real tough. Looks like we're still gonna have to go before the mass to face the C.O. That's means five years in the brig for me. That's what a furlough does to a man. (laughs) Those guys will burn them out! Come on, let's go! -Skip? -Huh? -See that hill? -Yeah. Take your men and circle around. Pete and me will go straight ahead. We'll take Chatfield with us so he won't get lost. Right. * That'll drive the red buzzards back into the hills. Chatfield, stay undercover of those woods. Work your way down to that valley of Koynam or whatever they call it. You spot any red goons, get back here on the double. I've been wanting to look at it. Be careful; don't get your pants blown off. Pete, cover him. He'd walk right in to a Chinese patrol and ask for a bowl of chop suey. Don't forget this position. We'll meet back here. * (explosions continue in distance) (man groaning) Anything I can do? (weakly): No. No, I've had it. Where are the people who lived here? Most got away, in the wood. Are there many Chinese patrols? Yes. Yes. Watch out, Yank. McCaffrey sent me to cover you. He wouldn't trust me with anything, would he? Well, I got information for him. (explosions continue in distance) * (groans) (gunfire continues) (quietly): Pete, there must be more of them around. Our best chance of getting back is to separate. -Yeah, but how's your shoulder? -It's okay. Now, look, you go that way, and I'll go through the woods this side. Now get back to McCaffrey. Okay. (explosions continue in distance) My dear one? My dear one? Song Do. Lee-san. My friend. Just as I thought. What'd softy boy do, stop somewhere for tea? No, you had him all wrong. This guy is tougher than a 50-cent steak. We were dropped by a red patrol. When they busted his shoulder, he still blazed away at them. Yeah? Where's he at? He made it into the woods. Well, he's on his own. I ain't gonna risk a detail to save his hide. Just to find you alive, it's better than any medicine. I've got to get back to my squad now. You stay hidden here. Our forces are moving up; you'll be safe then. You stay here, too. The wound is bad. You must rest. No, there's no time for that. (sighs) (woman shouting in Japanese) The Chinese soldiers come. All right, get your people out of here. Come on, get them out of here. You'll all be shot for this. -And what happens to you? -I'll just give them the McCaffrey treatment. Song Do, go! Go, Song Do! My love, remember, our lives will be joined together by what these fools call death. (gunfire) McCaffrey! So you found yourself a chick out here and got yourself all shot up so you can go back and set up light housekeeping. I'm not going back anywhere. Shut up, punk! When our guys come through here, you get yourself back to an aide station and take all these people out with you! All right, Pete, knock that red gook off. Go ahead! Hold it! We'll take him back with us. Maybe he'll do some talking. All right, all you people, out! Come on, out! (explosions continue in distance) What the hell are you doing here?
