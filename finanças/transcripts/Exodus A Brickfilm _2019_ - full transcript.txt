These Hebrews are a plague. Multiplying, infesting... If we let them go on like this, they will bring trouble to all of Egypt. They will anger our gods by filling this nation with their talk of their God. They will eat all of our grain reserves and become a burden to our economy. They could even become a mighty army. A might army that joins our enemies and fights against us. We have to make sure that doesn't happen. It's time for the Hebrews to earn their keep in my land. Put them to work, building my storage cities and, Vezir, make it hard, so that they know the power of Pharaoh, just to make certain that they don't become even more of a threat. I want every Hebrew boy that is born to be taken from his family and thrown into the Nile. Faster! Lord, you promised to bless us. But, we're slaves, have you forgotten us? Oh God, deliver us. Blessed are you, Lord, our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with his commandments, then commanded us to bring our sons into the covenant of Abraham, our father. How will we keep him safe? I don't know, but God will help us. He'll help us find a way. You are my beautiful son, and God has much more in store for you than to be drowned by Pharaoh in the waters of Egypt. Go with God, my child. Look, there's a basket floating in the water. Slave, bring it to me. What? A Hebrew baby boy. My father will not get this one. He is my son now and I will call him Moses because I delivered him from the water. Moses. Moses. Moses was raised in Pharaoh's household and educated in all the ways of the Egyptians. And this is? Osiris? Horus, Moses, the god of the sky. And he became a powerful man, both in his words and in his achievements. But, deep in his heart, he knew that he was a son of Israel. One day, when he was 40 years old, he decided to go and visit his people, and he saw how much they were suffering. Get up, you dog! Stop, stop, leave him alone. Why do you care about some dirty slave? I said, get up! Why? Because he is one of my people. Look, it's Moses. Get off, you! Hey! Hey, you guys are brothers. Why are you fighting against each other? Are you our leader now? Did somebody send you to be our deliverer? Or are you just going to kill us like you did the Egyptian? Everyone knows what I did! I need to get out of here. Everyone did know, including Pharaoh, and he tried to have Moses killed. But, Moses escaped and fled from Egypt. He traveled for days through the wilderness under the hot, desert sun, until he came to the land of Midian, where he came upon a well. Get out of here! This is our water. But, our flocks need water. Who cares? Hey! Huh? I suggest that you go find water elsewhere. Let's go! Oh, thank you, I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come along. Our father will be grateful to you too. Please, you must come and meet him. Father, this is the man who rescued us from the shepherds at the well. Peace be with you, my son. I am Jethro, priest of Midian, and I am grateful for the kindness you have shown to me and my daughters today. Come, you must stay and eat with us. Moses told Jethro his story, and Jethro invited him to settle there for a while. So, Moses made his home in Midian, and Jethro gave him his oldest daughter, Zipporah, as his wife. And he worked as a shepherd, taking care of Jethro's flocks for 40 years, but back in Egypt, the people of Israel continued to suffer, and they cried out to God for deliverance. And he heard their cry. Moses. It's not burning up, that's strange. Moses. Here I am. I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. I have seen the suffering of my people in Egypt, and I am going to deliver them and take them to the land I promised to your fathers a long time ago. So come, Moses, I am sending you to Pharaoh, and you will lead my people out of Egypt. Me? Lord, this deliverance is a great idea, but who am I to go to Pharaoh? Who am I to lead your people? Moses, I will be with you and you will be bring the people to this place, and you will worship me here together. But, Lord, they're probably going to have some questions. They're going to say, which god sent you? What is his name? I AM who I AM. Tell them that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob has sent you to them. They will listen to you, and when I show my power in Egypt, Pharaoh will let the people go. But, what if they won't listen to me? What if they just say, "Come on, Moses. "God didn't appear to you." Moses, what is that in your hand? My staff. Throw it on the ground. Now, pick it up. What? By the tail. Wow! So that they will believe that the God of their fathers has sent you. Lord, that is impressive, and I am sure they will be amazed, but talking to Pharaoh is a whole different story. You see, I've never really been very good at, at speaking. I will be with your mouth. I will tell you what to say. Can't you just send somebody else? I will send your brother, Aaron, with you, and you will take the staff with you and you will use it to perform miracles, so that Pharaoh may see my power. So, Moses took his wife and two sons and he returned to Egypt, and he carried the staff of God in his hand. Ah, Moses, I was told you had returned. Why are you here after all these years? The God of Israel has appeared to us, and he has sent us to tell you to let his people go into the wilderness to offer sacrifices and worship him there. I don't know this God of yours. I am the son of Ra, and I make the decisions in Egypt. Besides that, you aren't here because any god has spoken to you. You are here because the people are lazy. They are just trying to get out of work. No, I will not let them go. But, let me tell you what I will do. I will teach you all a lesson about who is the real lord in Egypt. From now on, I will no longer give the slaves straw for making bricks. They will have to go out and find it for themselves and they will continue to make the same number of bricks as usual, not one brick less. Some deliverer you are, Moses. Pharaoh's gonna kill us now, thanks to you. Lord, I knew this was a bad idea. You brought me here to help your people, but all it has done is make things worse. Moses, I promised Abraham that one day, I would give his people the land of Canaan, that I would be their God and live among them. I repeated that promise to Isaac and again to Jacob. When I make a promise, I always keep it. I am about to put my power on display throughout the land of Egypt. I am going to bring judgment against Pharaoh, and deliver Israel from his hand. When I do, the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. Go, tell these things to the children of Israel and tell Pharaoh to let my people go. This is what the Lord says to you, "Let my people go so that they may worship me." The Lord of a bunch of slaves? I see no evidence you even have a god. It's a snake. That's a nice trick, but it's nothing I haven't seen before. Magicians! Show our visitors some Egyptian magic. Moses, it seems your god is a bit outnumbered. Our snake is swallowing up the others. I don't care how many snakes your staff eats. I still will not let your people go. In the morning, go and meet Pharaoh on the bank of the Nile. Take your staff with you. This is what the Lord says, "I have sent my servants to tell you to let my people go. Yet, you haven't listened to me, but when I turn the waters of the Nile to blood, then you will know that I am the Lord." Look! Once again, simple magic. Magicians, show them that these tricks do not require the power of their so-called god. I am not impressed, Moses. The answer is still no. The Lord says, "Let my people go." Not a chance. Flies, flies! This is not a trick. This is the finger of God. Maybe you should let them go. Don't talk to me about this Hebrew God. The slaves are staying right here, every last one of them. Let my people go. They are not his people. The Hebrews are mine. Look, the ash has become boils! Pharaoh could take some wine. It would ease his pain. My Lord, these men are destroying Egypt. Please, just let them go and serve their god. I will not let them go. Fire! Locusts! Who's there? Show yourself! Pharaoh, this is what the Lord says, "How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me? "Let my people go so that they can worship me." Get away from me, Moses, get away from me. And don't ever come here again. The next time you see my face will be the day you die. Pharaoh, listen to what the Lord says, "I have sent these plagues on you to show you my power. "But you still exalt yourself against me. "At midnight tonight, I am going to pass through the land "and strike down the firstborn "in every Egyptian household, including yours. "All of Egypt will wail and mourn "while the sons of Israel rest peacefully. "And when this happens, you and your officials "will be begging me, begging me "to take the people and go." The Lord has told us, tonight, each family must take a perfect lamb and kill it. And then, take the blood of the lamb and smear it on the doorposts of your house. When he sees the blood, it will be a sign that you belong to him. He will pass over you and not allow the destroyer to enter your home. Stay inside your homes and eat the lamb together, but be ready to travel because tonight, the Lord will bring you out of Egypt. That night, at midnight, the Lord struck down all the firstborn sons of Egypt. There was not a single Egyptian household where someone had not died. Bring me Moses and Aaron! Get out, leave my people, all of you! Take your flocks, your herds and everything and go worship your God the way that you want to. But, bless me as you go. So, the people of Israel gathered their belongings and went out from the land of Egypt. The Lord went before them, in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night. I am going to harden Pharaoh's heart, and he and his army will come after you, but don't be afraid. I planned this to display my power, so that Egypt will know that I am the Lord. What was I thinking letting all those slaves get away? Gather my army and make my chariots ready! Those people belong to me. Pharaoh, it's the pharaoh's army! Oh no! The Egyptians! Why did you bring us out here to die? There weren't enough graves to bury us in Egypt? It would be better to be a slave in Egypt than to be a corpse in the wilderness. Don't be afraid. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord. After them! Yeah! Why aren't we moving? We're stuck, my lord. Turn around. The Lord is fighting against them. Now raise your hands over the sea again. They traveled until they reached the desert of Sinai. And they camped at the base of the mountain, where the Lord had first appeared to Moses in the burning bush 40 years earlier. Speak these words to the people. You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I rescued you and brought you to myself. If you will trust me and obey me, you will be my own special possession among all the peoples on earth. Now consecrate yourselves and get ready because in three days, I am going to come down to meet you on this mountain. Moses, you speak to us and we'll listen, but don't let God speak directly to us or we'll all die. Don't be afraid. I will go up and meet him and he will speak to me there. Moses, take these commands that I give you and tell them to the people. I am the Lord your God who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt. You shall not have any other god but me. You shall not make for yourself an image or idol of any kind. You shall not misuse the name of the Lord your God. Remember to observe the sabbath day. Honor your father and mother. You shall not murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony against another person. You shall not covet anything that belongs to another person. Moses has been up there a really long time and we don't know if he's ever coming down from there. Maybe a wild animal killed him. Maybe he saw the face of God and it struck him down dead. Whatever happened, we can't stay here forever. Aaron, make us a god who will lead us to the promised land. Listen to me everyone. Get us much gold as you can and bring it to me. The people brought their gold to Aaron and he melted it down and formed it into the image of a calf. Look, this is your god, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. You shall not have any other god but me. You shall not make for yourself an image or an idol of any kind. We worship you, O God, with sacrifices. Moses, go down to your people whom you brought from Egypt. Their hearts have become wicked and they have made an idol for themselves. Aaron! What were you thinking? You know how these people are. They came to me and said, "Make a god for us "who will lead us on from here." They brought me all their gold. I threw it into the fire and out came this calf. Aaron, prepare the people to dedicate themselves to the Lord. I am going... I am going back up on the mountain and maybe I will be able to convince the Lord to forgive you. Take the people and leave this place, and go to the land I promised them. I will send my angel before you, and he will drive out all your enemies, and make sure that you have everything you need. But I, myself, am not going with you. But, Lord, these are your people. If you are not going with us, then please, don't send us from here. How will the nations know that you are God if you are not with us? Isn't it your presence among us that makes us different from everyone else on earth? Moses, because you have kept your heart pure before me, I will go with you and the people. Go back down the mountain and take these new stone tablets with the commandments on them, and tell the people to be very careful to obey everything I have told you. Build me a holy sanctuary so that I can live among my people. You will worship me there with your offerings and when you have sinned, you will bring a perfect lamb and offer it to me to make atonement for your sins. I will forgive you. I will keep my covenant with you, and I will do miracles among you like no one on earth has ever seen. And wherever you go, people will see my power and glory. The Lord led them faithfully, but the people complained continually. There is no water. How can we survive in a land with no water? What is the point of bringing us out of Egypt if we're all just going to die of thirst? Strike the rock and I will make water come out of it, so the people can drink. It's water, praise God! Moses, now there's no food. Did you bring us up here to starve us to death? In Egypt, we had meat and bread every day, as much as we wanted. What is it? It's some kind of bread. It's breakfast! And the Lord provided manna from Heaven every day for 40 years. I'm losing my appetite. In Egypt, we feasted on meat and fish. And cucumbers and melons and onions, ah, and garlic. But, ever since we started following Moses, manna for breakfast, manna for lunch, and manna for supper. I am tired of manna. Ah, why is that we have to wait for the word of the Lord to come through Moses? It's not like Moses is the only person that the Lord speaks through anyway. Hasn't he spoken through us too? Who do you think you are anyway? As if you're so much greater than us. We are all the Lord's people. We are all holy. He is with us just as much as he is with you. What good have you done for us? Sure, the land of Canaan is beautiful, but have you heard the reports from the spies we've sent? People there are too strong for us. We'll never get in. It's true, I was there. They are huge, we even saw giants. Compared to us, we looked like grasshoppers. Did the Lord deliver us from Pharaoh's army because he prefers to kill us with Canaanites? Listen everyone, listen. Egypt is a land flowing with milk and honey, flowing! And we didn't need to fight anyone there. We already had our own houses and land. Let's go back. Let's choose a new leader and go back to Egypt. Since they don't trust that I am stronger than the people of Canaan, they will never enter the land of Canaan. They will wander around for 40 years and die here in the wilderness. I will keep my promise to their children and I will lead them into the land. Oh, how long will these people reject me, after all they have seen me do for them? Why did you bring us to this terrible place? There is no grain, there are no grapes, and there is no water to drink. Gather the people together and speak to that rock over there, and I will bring enough water for everyone. Listen, you bunch of rebels! What are you doing? I'm so sick of these people and their complaining. When are you going to learn? You want water? Just watch, I'll give you water. Moses, I told you to speak to the rock, but you didn't trust me. You took the glory for yourself as if the power to bring water came from you and your staff. Because of this, you will not be the one to lead my people into the land I have given them. Out of all the peoples in the world, the Lord has chosen you to belong to him. He didn't choose you because you were bigger or better. He chose you simply because he loves you, and because he had made a promise to Abraham long ago. The Lord has protected you and made you into a great nation. He has blessed you and multiplied you, so that your number is like the number of stars in the sky. The Lord demonstrated his power and glory before Pharaoh and rescued us from slavery and brought us out of Egypt so he could give us this land he had promised to our fathers. From the day you left Egypt, you have constantly rebelled against him, but the Lord your God is a merciful God. And he has faithfully led you through the wilderness for these 40 years, humbling you and testing you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna. He did it to teach you that people do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of the Lord. Because I disobeyed the Lord, I will not be the one to lead you across the river. Joshua will be your leader from now on. And the Lord himself will cross over ahead of you and he will give you possession of the land that he promised to you. So be strong and courageous, and don't be afraid. He will be with you, he will never fail you... or abandon you.
