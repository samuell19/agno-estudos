Sarbati... Sarbati... There... Over there under the cot. Oh. Under it... Mummy! They're leaving. I'll be right there. Wow, bro. Is your mother able to recognise one from the other? Of course. She's educated not from Bihar. Silly girl. What are you doing? Don't you know it has to be delivered tomorrow? You guys are the limit! It's heavy, Sarbati. - I'll manage. - Let me help you. Let me take this. Not my fault. No problem, aunty. - Pick them up, 30-second rule. - No. I'm an honest woman. Forget the ones that have fallen on the ground. I don't want to serve these and burn in hell. Have you resigned? Mummy, madam is back. You guys, leave. Who are you? Why do you want to go inside the house? Mummy, please... Don't call me Mummy. I'm not your mother anymore. Mummy, I want to go to the bathroom. Stop this drama. Jerry... Jerry... Mummy... Have you given up that dirty job? Let me go, Mummy. Or else, I'll do it here! I know you're capable of that. You can do anything you want. Your parents don't mean anything to you. Why are you bringing Papa into this? He is dead, Mummy. You talk too much. No, he isn't. He's standing right here in a sari. If I don't guide her, who will? Sarbati... She has to work to earn money. Don't speak to me about money. I could've cooked non-vegetarian food if I wanted. I'd earn ₹4 more for chicken dumplings. But I didn't. I only make vegetable dumplings. I'm not doing this for you! I'm doing it for myself, to earn money, so that I can get out of this rat hole. Rathole, huh? Rat... Rat... Come out, I want to talk to you. Sarbati, patience. Get some water for your mother, Cherry. She works in a massage parlour! And you want me to be patient? Has the ceiling of your house fallen? - No. - What are you doing here then? Go home. She has become so selfish, Mummy. I can't get married because of her. Your massaging is ruining my future. Mummy. Will you stop this drama? I'm aware that I'm a girl, Mummy. When to smile or to cry when to talk or to keep quiet... I know. I'll manage. Dumplings are originally from Darjeeling. They're being made by Biharis and being gobbled up by Punjabis. Just like my fate is gobbling me up! Papa died in a stampede two years ago. That's when our lives ended as well. Ever since then, we've been trying to get our lives together again. Every day there is a new struggle. Instead of waiting for others to say it, I will say it. Uncle, at least add some milk! Sure. So, Fatty, what's up? The usual. Rinku, I heard you got rejected by Khatri's daughter too. Never mind her. Rinku has high standards. Have you seen her teeth? Her face looks like a kitchen grinder. Her teeth grind together every time she smiles. How can she reject Rinku? I've lost interest in studies, Mummy. Please get me married soon. This is the house. Is there a wedding? I've lost interest in studies, Mummy. Please get me married soon. Where are the guests? I'm going in. Every time I close my eyes, I see you. I can't live without you. Aunty, I want to marry your daughter. I'm ready to marry her. Look, I'm ready. - Marry her off to me. - Hey! Who the hell are you? How did you get in? My love wasn't receiving my calls. I got restless. Get her to talk to me, please. Go! You! I know how to deal with chickens like you! Understand? Get lost. I'm not leaving. I will marry Cherry. Marry me, Cherry. - Get lost! - Please. - I'm not leaving without Cherry. - Hey... - Oh, Cherry? - Yes. - Cherry? - Yes. Mine... Jerry. Oh, my brother-in-law! You're so cool, man. What "brother-in-law"? Are you crazy? You think there's no "man" in the family to protect them? Aunty, let me marry Jerry. - What's going on? - I'll take care of everything. I'll be the man of the house. What's happening? Who are you guys? Uncle... I am Rinku. I don't care whether you're Rinku or Pinku. Get out or I'll call the police. Police? What will the police do? Beat me up? I'm in love, uncle. And lovers are not afraid of anything! Yeah, right. Get out or I'll break your legs. Hello, who are you to intervene? Why are you hitting the poor guy? You're a neighbour, act like one. Who do you think you are? That doesn't matter. Who the hell are you? I love Jerry. I love Cherry. And I love Sarbati! Sarbati? ♪ You're as cute as a flower ♪ ♪ That's so beautiful ♪ ♪ Sparkling like a firefly ♪ ♪ As precious as stardust ♪ ♪ Don't shy away Like a touch-me-not ♪ ♪ Don't fly away Like wisps of cotton ♪ ♪ Even if you float away ♪ ♪ You will return to me ♪ ♪ You're as cute as a flower ♪ ♪ That's so beautiful ♪ ♪ Sparkling like a firefly ♪ ♪ As precious as stardust ♪ - You give me a massage. - Go inside. ♪ Your eyes hide tales ♪ ♪ Of sweet sorrow ♪ ♪ Rare to find nowadays ♪ ♪ Is your sweet innocence ♪ ♪ You're lost in your thoughts ♪ ♪ Do you ever laugh out loud? ♪ ♪ Do you ever express your feelings? ♪ ♪ Which song do you hum to yourself? ♪ ♪ You're as cute as a flower ♪ ♪ That's so beautiful ♪ ♪ Don't shy away Like a touch-me-not ♪ ♪ Don't fly away Like wisps of cotton ♪ ♪ Even if you float away ♪ ♪ You will return to me ♪ You'll find it spicy. I told you the ones near our place are better. Fine, you can go there. Don't get offended. He adds chemicals. It tastes synthetic. Since you're in the food business, you should take feedback positively. What happened? Do you want water? Did you make it too spicy? No, she's having the sweet ones. Please give some water. Do you have a chair? Look, she has lung carcinoma with mediastinal lymphadenitis and multiple lung opacities. In simpler words she has lung cancer, stage two. But there's nothing to worry about. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are available. Certain cases require both. - And... - The cost? Do you have health insurance? No. Each sitting will cost up to ₹150,000. In total, it'll cost around ₹2 million. The initial stages of treatment will show how your mother is responding. As the sessions progress, her health should start improving. I know you need it. Please keep it. We need ₹2 million. Do you have that much? No need to act so generous. If I had ₹2 million, would I be running this massage parlour? Please, ma'am. I'll pay you back. How will you pay me back? That too such a large amount? Mummy... - Let's go. - Come on... Such an expensive hospital. I don't want to go. - Where are you going? - Mummy. One minute. I can only help if aunty has HIV. See this one. An important announcement by the police. There's a 20% discount. Help the police stop terrorism. If you see any suspicious bag... He's hiding here in the market. Or a suspicious person, inform the police. Sir, I'll call you back. You there! Catch him! Don't let him escape. Stop! Catch him. Stop! Stop! Nab him. Trying to escape? Sorry, sir, I didn't realise while opening... No problem, miss. He's a criminal; He was running away. You helped us catch him. I'll take you to the police station and beat you up. Where have you hidden the drugs? These guys hide the drugs in all sorts of places. I can't discuss this in front of the ladies. - Take him away. - Come on. - Thank you. - Let's go. Uncle... What about our reward? He's a petty thief. If there were rewards for catching these guys, I'd be a senior officer by now. Uncle, but you said he's a criminal. Cherry! Move away! Hey, you! Why were you arguing? He's a cop. So what? Hurry up. Go! Go, go... But... And you are? I'm Jigar, he's Daddu, and the one with the broken neck is Timmy sir. Careful. And this is my gun. Jigar. - Put it away. - Sir... We don't have anything, sir. This is not even a gold chain. We don't want your stuff. We want our stuff. Get to the point, bro. Look, miss, remember the guy you banged into? The police caught him. Amazingly, he hid our stuff in a toilet before that. You will go and get it for us. Simple. - No thanks, excuse us. - Cherry... Do I look like I'm begging? You won't be excused. Jigar respect the ladies. Sorry. The police are inside; Our boys can't go in. They won't suspect you. Please go and get it. - Your sister stays with us till then. - No... - Jigar... - Yes? Buy her an ice cream. - Please, sir... - Bro... - Go... - It was by mistake. - Come. - It was a mistake. It was an accident! Please... Do you want one or two? - Hey! - Sir... - Get our stuff. - Give us ice cream. It was an accident, sir. Go. Sir... - Search them. - Sir. Please let me go in, sir. It will only take me two minutes. We're searching the place; You can't go in. - I'll be in trouble, sir. - No. - Pavan. - Yes, sir? What's the problem? She's saying she left some paper inside. I'll be in big trouble, sir. Sir, please. Let her go in. - Go. - You can go in. Listen carefully, miss. Our guy has hidden the stuff inside one of the toilets. You have to find it and get it. Simple. Gents toilet. Fine, give me two days. I'll call you in two minutes. I'll call you. Tell me... Timmy, she's here. Sis... What do you think? Can she save you? Got it? Take it out. I won't look. Take it out. Inside the bag? Sir, it's in the tiffin box. Tiffin? Tiffin. Those cops can smell our shit from miles away. Sorry, please excuse my language. Sir, the tiffin box... Want it back? Daddu do you have a plastic bag? - Jigar... - Yes? Get a plastic bag. Give me a bag. Take it. I'll close it. Let me close it, sir. Listen don't tell anyone about all this. You better not blabber to your boyfriend... I don't have a boyfriend, sir. You don't? No, sir. May I go? No, Timmy. No. Don't. Listen... Yes, sir? Leave that strand of hair as it is. You look pretty. - Jigar. - Yes, Daddu? - Go... - Sis. Bye-bye. Have you lost your mind? What if he'd shot us? It's wrong, Cherry. And what about the rubbish we have to deal with? Is that all right? It's not wrong! I simply picked up what had fallen on the ground. There's a lot of money in it. Exactly. Jerry, wake up. Go and freshen up. Comb your hair nicely. - Come in, son. - Rajinder, come in. - Come in. - Hello. - Hello, ma'am. - Come in. I want two photos, son. One, a family photo - of the three of us. - Sure, ma'am. - The other one is of just me in it. - Okay. Put my photo in a nice, cheap frame and write the date... No, don't write the date. Mr. Anil will tell you which date to write. In the shop... Why don't you die today itself? You brought him, didn't you? I didn't know she called him for this. What are you trying to prove here? Would you have done this drama if I were a boy? Jerry let's get the photo taken today. My face is still okay now. I'll look haggard later. Aunty... Aunty we can use Photoshop to... Oh, you'll use Photoshop, will you? You'll use Photoshop? - Get out of here! - Don't... - What are you doing? - You'll use Photoshop. You're not dead yet. You're alive. So am I. And as long as I'm alive, I won't let you die. Right... Left... Daddu, I heard something snap. It's nothing... - I heard... - Do the exercises. Left... There it is! I heard it again. Okay, enough. Take this off. Bro that girl is here. Rita? The new one. The pretty and innocent girl who'd got our stuff out. The one you fancied. You! You talk too much. What does she want? She got our stuff out for us. She deserves a commission. How did she know how much it was worth? I told her myself. She asked me and I told her. - I'm all for honesty. - Of course. How did she get our address? Timmy, is he mad? Don't you have any brains? No wonder you're not the boss! Do you have any common sense? Remember, I'd lost my wallet? She found it. My visiting card was in it. Personal... it had this address. Oh, my God... I checked her background, bro. It's clear. Her father is dead, sister is a student, mother has cancer. Poor thing sells ducklings. - Sells what? - Ducklings, those small ones. Idiot, they're called dumplings, not ducklings. Get her in. Sister come. Close the window, Jigar. Sit. Sir we want to work. "We"? How many of you are here? No... Bro, she's from Bihar. That's how they speak. She actually means "I". My mother is ill. I need money for her treatment. I'll do whatever you ask me to pick up and drop packages deliver... Timmy she thinks we're into illegal stuff. You're mistaken. That packet contained flour to cook samosas. We sell them in our shop. You should try them; They're delicious. Have one before you leave. It's too dangerous for a girl. But I had safely got the packet out that day. No one suspected anything. The cops can smell your shit from miles away, can't they? It's not as easy as it was that day. Sir, please. Try and understand this is a risky job. So is crossing the road. Love is also very risky. It can break your neck. I'm putting my trust in you. Don't betray me. Your mother won't die of cancer... I'll shoot her. Go. Come tomorrow. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Listen be back. Get a hold of yourself, bro. Daler sir, I've checked her background. Why are you taking my clothes off? Are you mad? Her background is clear. Her father is dead, her sister is a student. What have I done? Are you crazy? Her mother is suffering from cancer. Poor thing sells dumplings. What? Ducklings? - Put me down. - Yes, sir. So? She is an innocent girl. Lal won't have a clue. We've hit the jackpot. Don't worry. Remember, Timmy she's a girl, all right? Use your brains. Okay? - Catch him. - Be careful, Joginder. Daddu! Hey, listen to me... We will hear you tomorrow. You fatso... Tell me where you've hidden the drugs. Or else, I'll thrash both of you. - The drugs are nowhere in the market. - What? I'm telling you... - You're known as Danger Lal, sir. - Really? I swear. Boys get high on kerosene nowadays. - Do they? - Yes, sir. Wow! - They must really fear me. - Yes, sir. Idiot! These two won't submit easily. Then let's help them with that, shall we? Cocaine, heroin, smack, stuff they're known by different names. They're worth more than your life. It's a simple job. I'm the supplier, and Malik is the distributor. You have to pick up the stuff from me and deliver it to Malik. Where I get the stuff from and where Malik sends it none of your business. Do the job well to stay alive. Killing someone is not a big deal for us. With Baba Mardanda's blessings get started. Sir there's a girl here to see you. Send her in. Wait, what? Timmy sir has sent me to... Fish is the queen of water. And water is her life. If you touch her She'll get frightened. If you take her out of the water... She'll die. Roast her in an oven. And it'll be delicious. Squeeze some lemon juice. And she'll make a tasty dish. Sir! My phone... Fish is the queen of water. Even the walls have ears. Police. This is how we can be safe. Right. Has Timmy cast a spell on you? - What? - Are you aware of what you're doing? It's only flour. Awesome. A round of applause, please. He's clapping for you. Who are you clapping for?

She thinks she's an angel! I don't think she's any good though. She came and fell at my parents' feet, saying, "Uncle... aunty..." "Rinku and I belong together." Then she pounced on me saying, "Rinku, promise me you're mine!" I looked at her, and said, "Jasmine..." "Come on, stand up..." "What does 'no' mean?" "'No' means no. Okay? "Now, go. "And listen, take your cell phone with you." "Don't use it as an excuse to meet me, okay?" "Go." Jerry her face fell, you know? No... Jerry, don't... I am yours... only yours. I rejected her, didn't I? It's okay... You can go. She's crying... Oh, God! Such innocence! Hello... Inspector Lal, the city is flooded with drugs and you're sleeping? - Who is it? - Never mind. There's a girl who's making you - look like a fool every day. - A girl? How? Punjab Roadways. Bus number PB-05-7474. What does she look like? Where does she board the bus? Listen... do you have her photograph? You go back to sleep. People say, "Inspector Lal is a dangerous guy." Nonsense! Listen... Hey! Pavan! Slowly... Come on... - Stop the car. - Slowly. Stop. Stop. You guys, go check. Search everyone. No one should be left out. Sir. Everyone each passenger will be searched. Be quiet and sit patiently. - Madam, you search all the women. - Okay. - You search the ladies. - Yes, sir. Check properly. Take your bags out, everyone. Madam, show me your bag. Open your bag. Check properly. Whose bag is this? Open the bags and search them. Hello, madam! I'm talking to you. Hello... Sir is asking you something. Hello, madam, look here. Are you trying to avoid getting searched? I know Inspector Lal. Kusum, move aside. I'll check. Give me your bag. - I... - Please give me your bag, madam. Take your bag. What's inside? Comic books... What's this? It's just food! Come on, leave. You got away because I was there, Timmy. Otherwise, Lal would have hit the jackpot. Okay, bye. Stop crying, Jerry. Okay, sir... Nothing happened. Jassi is one of our guys. It could have gone wrong, sir. Timmy has a lot of enemies, one of them must be behind this. No, sir. Even I have a lot of enemies. Everyone is jealous of me because of the way I work. Or else how would the police get to know of my trip? I'm really scared, sir. Daddu... Use your brains, Timmy! Jigar. - Whose phone is this? - It's mine, sir. Mine. Come here. - Where's the call history? - No, sir... No... it wasn't me. No... No, sir. I like her. Madam... It wasn't me. Madam. I swear on my mother. It wasn't me... Sir... Sir, it wasn't me. Did someone use your phone? Yes. Joginder had used it in the morning. He must have called the cops. One of you has informed the cops. You tell me why he would've done it. And you tell me why he would have. Sir, I swear on Baba Mardanda... I didn't make any calls. I'm sure this rascal did. Shut up. Why will I inform the cops? Because you need money to take your girlfriend out on dates. He has been sitting idle ever since she has come. He's lying, sir. - My girlfriend is rich; She pays. - No, sir. Madam is from Bihar and he has a problem with that. Let me explain, sir. Jerry is a girl, and he's insecure because she's earning more than him. That's why this dog has informed the cops. You know what, sir? He wanted to be the boss. When he saw you giving all your attention to her, he tried to get her out of his way by... Sir... He is such a big liar! Ditto, sir. Don't copy my line. - Go on... - What? Nothing like that... Hail Baba Mardanda! Hail him. - Take him away. - Clean the mess. Thank you, sir. Thank you, madam. Sir, I'm not convinced. What if he's behind this and you have shot the wrong guy? No, Jerry my instincts are never wrong. Oh, please. You thought Rita would marry you, but your instincts were wrong. That's right, sir. Instincts can be wrong. We can't take a risk. There's no hurry. You can take a break. Don't let her talk you into this, sir. She's talking rubbish. Don't believe her. She's a girl! My uncle lives in Thailand. I'd rather die than betray you. No way. Don't listen to her. Shoot him, only then I'll leave. No, sir... Don't listen to her. No, sir... I know you didn't do this. Exactly. But it's impossible to find someone like her. She's great at her job. I can lose 10 guys like you, but I can't lose her. No, sir... Don't believe her. Don't listen to her. Sir, she'll get me killed! You'll need me! Please don't, sir! Please, sir... Sir! Should I spare him? No... Sir, I'll die! Don't listen to her! No, sir... Sir, don't listen to her. She'll get me killed! Trying to avoid getting searched? Open your bag, madam. You'll need me. Don't, sir! I'll die, sir. Please, sir. Madam... What do you want to discuss, Jerry? Sir, I... Timmy. Mr. Timmy... I can't work for you anymore. Please settle my dues. What's wrong? I just killed two guys for you. That's what scares me, sir. Your men think... I'm stealing their jobs. What should I do, Jerry? Should I kill them all for you? His Poor Majesty enters. Look at him... Fool! Stop, Timmy. Why are you hitting them? No, let's go inside. Be careful with your neck. Sit down. - Sit. - Let go! Take care. There are only two ways you can quit this job. Either get shot by the cops or by us. What should I do with you? You're a good girl. I'll let you go. You're a good man. Come and take your money tomorrow. Listen come tomorrow. What's wrong? Why are you sulking? I'm not. Mummy! Are you crazy? I have ice cream up my nose. Oh, come on! Cherry, don't... Cherry, please! You're so serious these days. Hello, Mr. Timmy. How are you, Jerry? Take the bag. Thank you, Mr. Timmy. You think I'm a nice guy, Jerry? Yes. Are you sure? You've helped me so much, Mr. Timmy. You're leaving; You'll lead a happy life. What about me? Sir? Timmy. You're very clever, Jerry. You know exactly when to call me sir, when to call me Timmy or Mr. Timmy. - Mr. Timmy... - Quiet! You work in a massage parlour, don't you? Yes, but... Give me a massage now. Mummy! Mummy, Cherry, we have to leave... Dumplings with spicy chutney. Press harder. Hurry up, aunty. Or else, you'll miss the train. So, where are you going? Patna or Darbhanga? Daddu... I'll shoot her. Should I? Should I shoot her or not? - Quick, tell me. - Wait. Wait... Move away. Wait... - Come on. - Go. Daddu... Mr. Daddu. My name is Mohinder Singh Chandal. Mohinder Singh Chandal. Mr. Chandaal... Not Chandaal! Chandal. Mr. Chandaal... Not Chandaal! Chandal. She did all this for me. For me... Keep quiet, aunty. Sit there. Aunty, sit. Sit down. Poor Timmy... He will be bedridden for life. It's not what you think, sir. I didn't do anything. I really didn't. I just pushed him. His pants were down. He tripped and fell. Why are you laughing? I knew it right when I saw you you're a shrewd and... Yes, Uncle? Yes, she is here. - Yes. - Move, Daddu. Uncle wants to talk to you. Hello... Hello, sir. Hello, my child? How are you? I didn't do anything, sir. No, no. Don't be scared. It'll be an easy death. Painless. No, sir. Please don't do this. I give you my word. So, tell me... should we start with your mother or your sister? No, sir listen to me. I'll do whatever you want. Good boy. That's like it. The powder will reach your house tomorrow. You have to deliver it to Malik's farm. Then you're free. I'll do it, sir. I'll do it. Okay. 100 kilos. How can I deliver 100 kilos, sir? No problem. Put me on speaker. Okay, sir. You're on speaker, sir. Daddu... Yes, sir? Hail Baba Mardanda! Hail Baba Mardanda! No! No, don't! I'll do it. Good. Okay. See you, buh-bye. What have you done! Sarbati, what are you doing? She's your daughter! But, Sarbati...

Know your place. - Please leave. - I won't. What do you mean you won't leave? - I'm not going. - Leave! I'm not going anywhere. This is my house too... - My family... - No. Quiet! Listen to me carefully. See there's no difference between food delivery and drug delivery. The only difference is fear. You won't be scared when you're delivering dumplings. But when you're delivering drugs, you'll be scared. It'll show on your face, and the cops will notice it. So you need to control your expressions. Pretend to be totally innocent. If anyone asks questions, start crying. Get it? Yes. I understand. - Okay. - Jerry, listen... Don't get smart with me. I am not Timmy. Start with your drama. The vehicle will come outside your house. My driver will get off, and you have to drive the vehicle. Why do I have to drive? Take a look at my men. Now look at your people. Now think like a cop. I get it. Can you drive, Anil uncle? I used to be a truck driver. I even have a licence. Are you all right, Sarbati? - Do you want water? - Mummy. What's wrong, Mummy? Mummy, what happened? I'm just acting. Me too. Is this okay, Jerry? Mummy! Help! Please help. Mummy is sick. She is shivering. We need to take her to the hospital. Please... Help. Jigar, let me check. Are you crazy? Come out... Come out. - What is it? - It was an accident. Come out. That girl was shouting for help, so that's why we are here. Sorry. This girl is mine. The neighbourhood is mine. And you'll help her? - How come? - Why? What's the problem? - Problem? - Yeah. Get lost. Rinku, no... Try your luck elsewhere. - Why are you doing this, Rinku? - Come out of the car. What if I don't? Watch it! - Hey! - Shut the... This is Rinku's neighbourhood! Let go of my hand. I'll teach him a lesson. What are you doing? Don't... Rinku! Rinku... Mummy is sick. We have to take her to the hospital. That's why I'm here, baby. Oh... we can go in that car. Why will you go in that car? You can take this one. Have you seen these guys, baby? One look at them and the patient will die! I'll get you... Rinku try to understand. Yes. Is he mad? You're so shy! Always worried about what people might say. No one will find out about us. Promise. I'm having an affair with her. I'll go and get your mother. Mummy! Go. Don't bother, Rinku. She's my mother-in-law. Silly girls. No, Rinku... - Mummy... - Wait, you don't understand...

Shoot, Jerry! - Hail Baba Mardanda! - Hail Baba Mardanda! Hello? Get the stuff to the restaurant. We have to go to the restaurant. Move... Yuck, this one's peeing. The van disappeared? Are you crazy? How can the van disappear? We were following them. They were right in front of us, and we were following them. Find the van! The cops haven't caught them. The cops have been searching for them all day. Are you double-crossing me, Malik? I'm not a loser, Daler. Had I been interested in the girl, I would've told the world about it. I'm not a cheater. I'm straight. Get me the real stuff and take the money. Else, get lost! Enough for now. Bablu. Yes, Bablu? Brother... it's not salt. That's great... Double profit. Superb! Brother... Yes!

That should convince you. Should I shoot her? Please call my mother and sister here. What if your men hurt them? They'll do no such thing. I'll be very worried about them. Please get them here. Won't it be awkward? In front of them? They're here too. - Move. - I'm not with them. I just hitchhiked. Go in. Shut up! I haven't done anything to her. She's crying already!

Mummy. Find something to hit him with. No, son. I really respect you. I won't hit you. Will you hit me? No one will hit you. We will. Kill us instead. Jerry... Cherry... Sarbati... Hi, Uncle. Jerry! Sir... Daler sir, good news. Jerry and her family were trying to flee, but I've caught them. Then get them here. - Sure, sir. - Take care. It's done, sir. This is the only way you and your family can be safe, Jerry. Help us catch Daler, and you and your family can go free. Listen to me carefully. As per the plan, you'll reach the restaurant with Jassi. Undercover cops will be there, and they will give me updates. Check. Everybody in position? Yes, sir. - Copy. - Position two copy. Both of you will go upstairs and engage Daler. Jassi will give me a signal when Daler appears, and we'll nab him. This is all you have to do. Get it? Where are you? Daler sir. Where are you, sir? Hello... Hello? Keep quiet. Give me the gun. Move. Hello? Have you reached, Jassi? Yes, sir. Left the family behind? Mummy... Why isn't this working? Hello? Hello. The police are surrounded on all sides. Put your weapons down or you'll get your ass kicked. Till they are red! Form a circle. Well done. Uncle, you come here. This way. You, go over there. What are you doing? Want me to shoot? This is not a circle, bro. Form a perfect circle. Don't move or I'll shoot. Situation under control? Uncle you can come out now. Took me for a fool, didn't you? Shit. Mummy. Mummy. Move back. Do you know who the real fool is? There. He's the real fool. Your admirer. Drugs? No, sir. Sir, I know we're safe as long as we have the drugs. Let us go. You'll get the drugs. Fine. You can leave. I have your mother and sister. Introduce us at least. What's your name, child? Cherry. What? Chhaya Kumari. Chhaya Kumari. And you? Jaya... Jaya Kumari. Welcome to Punjab, Miss Jaya Kumari. "Ji aaya nu" as they say in Punjabi. Come here, earn a living and enjoy life. Or don't. What did you think? That you're the boss now? No, my child. I'm the boss here. Mummy. I'm a non-violent guy.

Daler? Over here, on the left. What are you doing? Wait, stop! We're on the same team. Ram Malik is not on anyone's team. Malik is single! You're the distributor, and I'm the supplier. Of course we're a team. Look, we've even got the powder now. Come, let's sit and have a chat. Come on. Are you trying to fool me? Not at all. You're like my elder brother. Come with me. Here you go. You were worrying unnecessarily. All the powder is here. Happy? Like the taste? It's flour. It's what? It's flour! All the drugs... It's flour!

I know where the real drugs are. Where? Your house. My house? Hello. How are you, aunty? Please come in. Is she getting the pressure points? Make sure she's satisfied. Massage her legs properly. You don't know who brought it? I fell asleep after the massage. Fell asleep? The house could've been on fire! Check the cupboard! May I leave, sir? Won't you wish me good luck? Let's go. A new world awaits once you conquer your fears. You don't need to take a cab to get there. All you need is a little bit of courage. But once you reach there, I swear you'll love it. Luck favoured me. That's why I'm doling out wisdom. Otherwise, I'd be dead along with those gangsters. Before I sign out, all I want to say is... Hail Baba Mardanda!
