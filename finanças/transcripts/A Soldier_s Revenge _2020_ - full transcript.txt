Stay down! Get a count of the dead. No! You sons of bitches! You havin' those nightmares again? Frank. Frank, you're scaring me. Hey! You look awful. You need to go to town to see that doctor. You ain't the only Civil War veteran that seen the elephant. How do you know anything about it? Trash. You wouldn't understand. I'm not saying I understand, I'm just telling you, you need to get some help. Things I'd done. Things I've seen. Ain't no doctor can cure that. I ain't been to war, but I've had my fair share of battles. Don't belittle me, Frank! That's all right, darling. Hey. It's just a little out of your depth is all. Just stop. Oh, god. You think you know what it's like seeing... someone's head getting blown up by a cannonball. Huh? You ever seen a man with his scalp torn clean off? Hm? Where you goin'? Gonna take a piss. Is that all right with you, or should I call a doctor? Well, I'm goin' home. Okay. Screw you, Frank Connor! Don't bother callin' on me. Somebody get me the steward! We need a stretcher! - Hudsons, you go ahead! - Hey! Hey, Jake! Jake, listen to me. Listen to me. You're gonna be all right, okay? Think about your kids. You think about Betsy and your kids back home, all right? Tell my family I said I love them. No, no, no. Hey, listen. Listen to me. You're gonna tell them. We're gonna go back, I'm gonna bring you back before... - Just tell them I love them. - And you're gonna - tell them yourself. - Tell them I... - No! Jake! - All right, men! Jake, no! No! You sons of bitches! Come get it! I'll kill you all! Hmm? God, I thought you went away! It's time, Mr. Frank. - Who is it? - It's me, Sa'ani. Yeah. Yeah, you're right on time. Where to tonight, Mr. Frank? Ranch in Three Rivers, just south of the town. It not safe there. Yeah. All right. Fifteen minutes, meet me right back here. Yes, Mr. Frank. Goddamn stupid bastard, there's dynamite in there! Go on, get the rest of those boxes. Jackass. Chet. Chet? Where are ya? Is he there? You goddamn jackass, you messed up here. What the hell is this jackass doing? Are you Walsh? What the hell do you want? Artemis Walsh. Who the fuck are you? Are you Walsh or not? Well, that may be for me to know and you to find out now, ain't it? You've been stealing from the wrong people, Mr. Walsh. Wyatt, Chet, get in here! Wyatt! Nope. Why don't you just turn your ass around and get the fuck out of here? We can do this in here, or go outside. Your choice. Come on, Walsh. Die like a pig in here, or like a man outside. It's time. Good business, Mr. Frank? Yep. Let's get out of here. All right, come on. There's nobody in there. Frank, he's a boy, damn it! On your feet, come on. Let's go. Come on, soldier. Time to go. - Let's go. Come on. - Nothing left - to see here, it's all over. - Come on, soldier! - Get up! - Leave him! - We gotta go! - Let's go! - Come on, soldier. - Hey, there. We gotta go. Watch your back! Get down the road. "Bureau of Indian affairs." "Second Texas Rifle." Frank Connor. Knows me too well. You didn't think you two could actually get away? My safe! Violet. Vi, who opened my safe? Sir, I don't know. I didn't open it. - You didn't open it? - No, sir. Did the children open my safe, Violet? No. I mean, I don't think so. I don't watch them all day long. You got one job, to watch my kids. And not only are they gone, those little varmints robbed me! Mr. Connor, are you there? Mr. Connor! Mr. Connor? Hello? Please, sir! We need to talk with you. Mr. Connor, are you there? Mr. Connor? Mr. Connor, are you there? Mr. Connor? We need your help, sir! - Come here. Get in here. - Ow! Quick. - Hey, watch it! - Come on, stop! Who the hell are ya? Start talking, now. Look what you've done! I said who the hell are you? Ow. We'll find another way. Come here, come here. Hey, watch it! - Sit. - Ugh! Now, let's try this again. I said who are you, and what the hell are you doing here? - I said who the hell are you? - Okay! Okay, we'll explain. Just please don't hurt us. Please don't hurt us. Please, you're the only one that can help us. Who are you? Grace, and this is my little brother, Ethan. Okay, well, that's progress. Grace, Ethan, what are you doing out here? Well, we took a horse. Where's your parents? It's got a lot to do with our parents. You don't say. Well, it all started when our momma got married five years ago. Where's your daddy? He died. - Sorry to hear that. - He was a soldier. He was killed in the Simpsonville Massacre. Our momma said he was a hero, that he sacrificed himself to save five men. Sounds like a great man. Grace says that she remembers him, but I think she's lying. - I do remember him! - Sure. Hey, cut it out, you two. I don't really care. You best spit it out or get to the goddarn point. So, like I was saying, our momma got remarried five years ago. But, at first, we liked our stepdaddy, but soon, after they got married, he started treating us all real bad. Yeah, real bad. Our momma's been doing everything she can to hold things together. You know, for us. And then, last week, our parents went out of town. We went out on a school outing, but then, out of nowhere... we saw our stepfather. - So? - So? So they were supposed to be in Dallas together for a couple of days. And we hadn't heard from our mom for a week. She would never do that. Well, I tell you something, I feel so bad for both of y'all. I do. You're just tugging at my heartstrings. But why don't you tell me what this has to do with me, huh? Our stepfather locked a safe in his house, but he don't know we stole his combination. And Grace found some papers inside. - And with a little research... - We found you. Come on. There. Where the hell they'd go? There ain't nowhere to hide. They couldn't have gone far. Let's check those outbuildings we saw coming in. Let's get moving. Ain't nobody around for miles, they couldn't have gone far. Back up there to the right. - Come on, come on. - Let's go! - Do a once around. - All right. Hyah! I'll circle around. Watch my back. You see anything? - Nothing. - Let's go check them out. Where is he? They couldn't have gone far. Let's check the shack. Come on. Where the hell are those kids? There ain't nobody here. Hey! I don't see nothing. Briggs ain't gonna believe they just vanished into thin air. That don't matter, 'cause we ain't gonna tell him that. - What do you want to tell him? - We can say he wasn't here. Ain't no way I'm telling Briggs we had a busted flush. Right? Right. Well, let's get back to town. Maybe we'll see Connor there anyway. All right. Now it's my turn. What kind of information led you to me? Well, you were on a list. What kind of list? It had all these names, and then... and they had yours. And it had your birthday, your location, a drawing of you. And even your shoe size. Is that so? Why y'all come to me? Why didn't you go to the marshals? Because our stepfather works for the government. Yeah, he's a federal agent working for Congress. With the war department? No, I think he's something more high level. With the Bureau of Indian Affairs? Yeah, yeah. Let me ask you something. How do I know you two ain't lying to me, huh? There's a lot of names on this list. Yeah, and if you look to the right, it's very important. It says... - "Eradicate." - I looked it up. Eradicate means "pull it up by the roots." Or "do away completely as if pulled by the roots." Yeah, I know what it means. Think they'll leave us alone now? No, I don't suspect they will. I expect they'll be back before long. Where are we gonna go? "We"? Well, I expect that you two dummies would just die if I sent you back out on the prairie. All right. I'm gonna go back to the cabin and get us some supplies and figure all this out. Stay quiet. Okay? It's okay. Mr. Briggs. Don't call me that, Mr. Danziger. Appreciate you making your way back to the Compound after supper. I don't like to miss dessert, you know it's the best part of the meal, and she was pretty too. How many times I gotta tell ya? Don't salute me! This ain't the military! - Not now. - Who's got the wagon set up? Where's his stuff? You should do a check. I'll go on out and I'll be right back, and we'll make sure it's written. Okay, I'll be right back. Take the paper with you. And read it. Okay, I'll be right back. Get it all done before the boss sees it. Say, Danziger, you don't have a, uh, a light, do you? With all due respect, there's gunpowder residue everywhere. Whole building could blow if you drop that cigar. You don't think I'd be stupid enough to blow up my own infantry, do you? Could you imagine if somebody told Ulysses S. Grant that he couldn't smoke a cigar in the White House? No, sir. So... You wanna talk about something? Yes, sir. Yes, sir, I do. Uh, well, first of all, let me just say... Ah, cut the ceremony, this ain't the army. You can speak freely. In fact, why don't you take a seat? Yes, sir. Go get them horses from the water! Sir, Washington D.C. is beginning to question some of our activities. Oh? They've already contacted captains in three of our operating arenas, and just last week, an agent from the Bureau of Indian Affairs contacted me directly and had some very... ...specific questions about our procedures. Uh-oh. They seem to believe that we are selling weapons to the Natives, when, of course, we ought to be selling to the settlers. And if I may continue to speak freely sir... Go on, Robert. Sir, I think maybe this operation ain't under the law. And, uh... I got a family to tend to, and, well... I feel I've done some good time here and, with your permission, of course, I'd like to get while the gettin's good. Say no more. You have a family to tend to. Yes, sir. Well... I suppose... if you can't ethically and morally commit yourself with a hundred percent of your being to this arrangement, then I have no choice but to release you from your responsibilities. Sir. Well, sir, that is, uh... Thank you, sir, I... I do appreciate it. And my wife and children will surely appreciate it too. There's one thing you should know though, Danziger. You should know there's only one way to leave my operation. Sir... Please, please. You are dismissed. Lousy bootlicker. Hey, Briggs. Feldman and Kennedy are on the wire. We're just finishing up here. What we got? Connor is not home. We'll find them. He just slipped his hovels. "No, sir, we'll find him. He just slipped his hovels." What about the kids? Kids, question mark. Uh... They were not there either. "Kids not there." Don't stop looking for 'em, and when you find them, you hold them, and you let me know immediately. "Keep looking." "Hold them. Be quick." He got away, we'll find them soon though. Period. - "We'll find soon." - I don't have soon, Feldman. Feldman. Do what you have to do to bring my kids home. "Find those kids... now." That's it. Let's just pack that up and go. Ay-yay-yay. Damn. What? Your mother's somewhere between here and El Paso but you don't know where, huh? Yes. Well, we figured you'd know where she is. Yeah? What makes you figure that? We know all about you. You're a part of the Second Texas Mounted Rifles. Hey, look, Mr. Connor, we know you're living out in the boonies, but you're a real hero in the war. - I weren't no hero. - Sure, you were. There are no heroes anymore, kid. But you saved lives, and you, you helped people. No, I watched men, women, and children die right in front of my face, and there was nothing I can do about it ninety-nine percent of the time. That ain't no hero. Is he okay? What makes you think I can find your mother? Because you've got to! What's your mother's name? - Heather. - Heather. Heather. Heather what? Heather Powell. You do know her. Mr. Connor, how do you know our mother? Mr. Connor! Wait, Mr. Connor! Where are you going? Wait for us! What's going on? Is this some kind of joke, huh? No, sir. You tell me the truth. How'd you know where to find me, huh? Y'all two ain't been honest with me! How do you know who I am! Hey, what! He gave this to our mom. You were the only Frank on our stepdaddy's list, and we figured it was you, and we were right. Now you tell us, how do you know our mother? Please, Mr. Connor. Your... Your mother was the only one that I ever truly loved. And we were together for a very short while, but, uh... But what? It didn't work out. Why? You're too young to be asking those kind of questions, all right? Why didn't it work out? 'Cause I wasn't good enough for her! 'Cause I was a horse's ass. Because I, I just, I couldn't handle real life when I got home from those bloody battles. What happened? Just stay the hell away from me! Here they come! Where is the little lady? The safe. Well... Bring her out. I'll get her for you. I don't want to see him, tell him to go away. Just hobble your lip and come on. I refuse. What the hell is wrong with you, Travis? How are you, sweetheart? Are my men taking good care of you? Oh, do not trifle with me! What is going on? Heather. You need to settle down. Everything is A-okay. You. You... You are a madman! Where are my children? Where are they? Where are they? Where are my children? They're fine, Heather. Although, Grace did get a B on a spelling test for which she was punished. We are an A family, as you know. And Ethan tends to be quite the crybaby, but we had a little talk. If you hurt them, I swear to God... I swear to God... Now, why would I hurt my children, Heather? They are my children. That's not what she said when we married. Travis... Please, I... I don't know... I don't know what you're up to here, I don't care. But if you just, please, let me go home to the children. I... I swear you... You'll never have to hear from me again, I will go away forever. - Please. - "Forever"? Unfortunately, it's not that simple. You see... You have more value... to my mission. Your mission? Am I ransom? Uh, is that what I am? Is that all I am to you? I mean... I... I knew... I knew it. I... There was always something. There was always something wrong about you, about us. Uh-oh. Well, I'm afraid that might be my cue. Well... Little angel. I'll be back to check on you later. Oh. I almost forgot. I bought you some of those revealin' petticoats that you like so much. Why don't you go back inside, and... change into something a little more comfortable? I'm sure my boys would enjoy that. You son of a bitch! Kickin' ain't gonna get you nowhere, unless you're a mule. Remember that, sweetheart. Get off me! Stay the hell away from me! Stay away from me! Get off me! - Let's go, boys. - Get off me! We've got a fighter. Get off me! Get off me! This is good. We can stop there. Get on down, come on. Hey. Thought you should eat something. Thank you. We'll sleep here tonight, continue on in the morning. Mr. Connor, where are you taking us? A friend of mine. I'm gonna make sure you're both taken care of. But we wanna stay with you. You ain't staying with me, nah-uh. A friend of mine is gonna make sure you're safe until I can figure out what's going on. But, Mr. Connor, we can't just... Don't question my decision. Otherwise, I'll leave you out here in the middle of a desert to fend for yourselves, you got it? Finish your eatin' and get some sleep. Come on. You two sleep a lot. Momma said kids have to get a lot of sleep to grow big and strong. Well, then you two growin' to giants. Come on. Gotta get going. Come on, lazy slug. Get up. Well, I'm up. Come on, come on! What do y'all want? I didn't do nothing! What are you chasing me for? Come on, come on. All right, all right. I'm here, what do you want? I didn't do nothin'! Come on, boys. What's this about? Tell me what y'all want! You boys got a problem? All right, all right, game over. What do you want? Tell us where Frank Connor is. You couldn't just ask me that without all the scare tactics? - Where is he? - I don't know! Where have you been hanging out with Frank Connor? I don't know where he is. I left him a week ago, I ain't seen him since. You're lying, you're getting off that horse right now. - No, no, no, no, no. - Yes, you are. - No, no! - Get off that horse. Get off! - No, no, no, no! - Get down here! Do yourself a favor and tell us where Frank is. Look, I'm telling you the truth, I don't know where he is. I don't know, I promise! - I don't know where he is. - Tell us. Where is he? - I don't know! - He's a killer, ma'am. - Where is Frank Connor? - I don't know! - Please, I'm telling the truth! - Where is he? I don't know where he is! - You lyin'... - I don't know! Dispose of her! How do we get her? Grab her legs. Come on. Good to see you, Mr. Frank. How are you, old friend? Alpana! Hope you don't mind us dropping in for a visit. Mr. Frank. I made some good old sage bread, and rabbit stew. Mm, thank you. You don't mind taking us in, do you? Of course, Mr. Frank. Our home is your home. Go on. Hello. Hello. What's your names? I'm Grace, and this is my little brother, Ethan. Nice to meet you. Good to meet you, Grace. Good to meet you, Ethan. Come, come in. I'm not trying to be rude, Mr. Connor, but how did you make friends with an Indian? Sa'ani here is one of the best, uh, translators I've ever known. One of the bravest men I ever met as well. He saved my life once. - Really? - Mm-hm. How'd he do that? Well, um, so Sa'ani and I, we were, uh... We served together in a unit. We were soldiers. One day, Sa'ani was, he was serving as a scout, so he was charging up ahead of the group, and there was a sharpshooter, and he had a bead right on my forehead. Would've got the drop on all of us. But Sa'ani snuck up there with his knife, and... ...ended that sharpshooter right quick. That fella's rifle went off, coming for him, so we had to ride to his rescue. Mr. Frank saved me. Yeah, but only after you saved me. For that, I am... eternally grateful. No, we will always be indebted to Mr. Frank. I didn't do anything. How many people have you two killed? I think that's a story for another day. No disrespect, Mr. Connor and Mr. Sa'ani, but we really need to find our mother. Please, Mr. Connor. You've got to help us. Time's running out, she can be in a lot of trouble. Y'all two don't be rude. Eat this here food they've prepared for you. We'll move on soon. Very tasty, thank you. Well, well, well, Frank Connor. - Well, good to see you, hoss. - How are you, pard? Ah, we're alive and well. How are you? I'm okay. I'm okay, I need your help with something. Name it. Had two kids show up in my shack out of the blue followed by two men working for a man named Briggs. - You heard of him? - Heard of him? I work for him. He's a no-good scoundrel, and one of these days I'm gonna get him. Okay. You heard of a woman named Heather Powell? Blonde hair, green eyes? That's his wife. Pretty young thing. Yeah. She's been missing for a week and I need her found. - Can you do that for me? - For you? You betcha. I'll try and cut a trail. And if I find her, I'll get word to you. Appreciate it. Take care. Get you a whiskey next time. Come on. What are you doing? Miller, get out of my way! I got Briggs's orders. Get your parcels. You're coming with us. I'm not going anywhere. Not until someone tells me what's going on, and where you're taking me. It's none of your business. Just leave me the hell alone. All of you. All of you nasty men. Don't any of you animals have a heart? I've got two children who need their mother. Do you even know what Briggs is doing, huh? He's not working for the government. He's taking advantage of all of you, you're all damn fools for that beast of a man. So stay the hell away from me. You married him. Who's the bigger sellout? Take this dirty, filthy, disgusting, disease-ridden whore away from me! Oh! - Get on that horse! - Stop! No! Ow! Let's go. Captain McCalister. - To what do I owe the pleasure? - Major Briggs. Yes. There seems to be some discrepancies in your reports regarding the resale of weapons. Now, I'd like a little explanation as to what's going on with your activities. Well, then why don't we start by discussing my activities? Please. Now I must say, with all due respect, from my vantage point, the operation is rolling along just fine. Weapons are selling to the settlers, although perhaps I should remind you, the southwest is quite expansive. Sometimes, it just takes a bit more time to make contact with each and every American. There have been a series of unfortunate events that lead me to believe that your guns have wound up in the hands of the Natives and the Mexicans, and not our American settlers. Now... in fact, we have tracked some of the weapons that attacked our army back to your stockpile. Hm. Would you care to share some thoughts on that? Well... Captain McCalister, if I may, uh... - speak freely. - Please. But don't waste my time with excuses and apologies. No, no, I'm not a time-waster, nor do I offer excuses. But I will tell you this much. If you don't stop crawling so far up my asshole, I will be notifying President Grant of your continued ongoings with a sweet little something named Jenny. Hard-boiled eggs are yellow on the inside, Mr. Briggs. Are you sure you wanna run around spreading gossip like some big-city reporter? I'm gonna give you one more chance to clear your name and show the White House that your weapons are making it into the hands of our settlers! And not the Mexicans and the Indians! And I hope that these instances of malfeasance or anomalies are not the norm. And if I don't see production from your little outfit here, I will take it away from you, and send you back to South Georgia where you belong! Oh, and Mr. Briggs. I will make sure you see Valdosta again. Only this time, you won't be wearing a uniform. You'll be target practice for the Union Army who still doesn't know the war is over. - Good day. - Good day, Captain. Always a pleasure. Don't you start a war with me. I'm afraid you might not like how I fight. Round up. Violet! Travis Briggs, huh? Where'd you come up with that one, huh? Did you get it from some soldier you killed? Connor. Is that it? Hm? "Connor?" That's all you got to say to me, huh? After all these years, after everything we've been through together, after everything you've done? That's all you've got to say to me? You can go to hell. Well, I see you haven't changed, Henry. Except maybe your name. Yes, "Travis" does sound like less of a traitor than Henry. Heather sure as hell likes it better. Well, finally, after all these years, I found out who she ran to. Mm, let's be honest, Connor. You were out of the picture a long time before that. Plus she never even loved you. Well, it don't matter anyway. Oh, no? How's that? 'Cause I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. I'm sure you are. I know what you've been up to since the war. Meanwhile, I've been getting rich, you... become a gunman. Now, how are you gonna explain that to your kids? You know exactly what I'm talking about, Connor. A mother and her two babies that you walked out on. Where are they? I know you got 'em. I didn't walk out on no one. Oh, no? What would you call it? I roll my own hoop and I am tired of the job of some shadow rider. Now take a seat. Now think this through, Frank. You can't kill me. Oh, yeah? Why not? 'Cause I got Heather. You hear that, Connor? You didn't think I thought this through, did ya? I'm gonna have this place surrounded. They see everything. Connor, come out with your hands up! You're gonna get a bullet you ain't gonna be able to digest! Hello. Hello. They know who you are. Ain't no secrets here. Where the hell you scissorbills been? This traitor damn near killed me. Sorry, sir. We got here as soon as possible. As soon as possible? Thought you was tracking me. You said you didn't want to be tracked. Yeah, no matter. Get him out of my house before I blow his guts out. Let's go, come on. - Let's go! - Go! Keep it movin'. And find my kids! Come on, you two. All four of you. He's just taking advantage of you. I mean, you know that, right? You know all this. Killed his own men. I mean, you know what Briggs is up to, don't you? I mean, I have to assume you all know that Briggs ain't even his real name. See, Connor, nothing you say is gonna convince us. I suggest you keep your mouth shut, or I'll have no choice but to gag ya. You broke the law, you're going to prison. The law? Oh, we're way, way above the law here. I mean, you do realize that boy, his real name is Henry T. Bartlett. He's a wanted criminal for killing innocent women and children, but y'all are too stupid to even know that. Just ignore him. Is that what Briggs is up to? It ain't none of our business. He's probably even screwing your wives. Whoa! My wife? Pete, gag him! Pete, what the hell? Connor! Don't let him get away! Right there! Damn it. Connor! Don't let him get away! You can't hide from us! Go to the back, Pete. Where is he? Over here, over here! Anybody see anything? Circle around! Circle around, and listen! Circle around! Fire a shot if you hear anything. I don't see him, Feldman. Don't shoot him. You hear me? Don't shoot him. Briggs wants him alive. You boys see anything? I see something over here! Circle that way. Go around to the left and to the right. And then come back this way. Come back towards me, just flush him out towards me. Connor? You see him? He didn't go far. Everybody shut up for a minute! Flush him out! Don't fire your guns! You see him? Don't fire, just listen. Flag him. Stop it! Briggs is gonna be pissed off! Did you get him? We gotta find him, boys. Yeah, but we're going nowhere goddamn near. - He can't be that far away. - Make him go to the back towards me. Briggs is gonna be one pissed off son of a bitch if we don't find him! Man's tied, can't go far. Come on, boys! Anything? Hold your fire. Quiet, quiet, I hear something. Be quiet. - Check that! - Over here! I don't see him, I don't see nothing! Come on, hurry up! Briggs is gonna kill us. Couldn't have gone far. Come on boys, let's go! He's getting away! Come on! You okay, Feldman? Sa'ani! Alpana! Grace! Ethan! Ah, shit. Sa'ani! Alpana! Grace! Ethan! Sa'ani, Sa'ani, Sa'ani. Hey, hey. Mr. Frank. I'm sorry. Sorry. I let you down. No, no, no, no. No, Sa'ani. I'm gonna take care of you. Okay? I'm gonna fix this. Mr. Frank. I'll be okay. All take good care of me. Sa'ani. Sa'ani, you stay with me, all right? You hear me? You stay with me. You stay with me, hey! Peace comes within. Do not seek without. Who the hell are you? It don't matter. Well, at least tell me your name, so I can kick your ass in the afterlife. I'm like you. Been left behind with nothing to do with my skills, but to kill. Briggs send you? All right. Why don't you pull that trigger? The government made us who we are. You can either fight it, or embrace it. You can go to hell. Mr. Frank. No, no, no. Sa'ani! No! Sa'ani. I'm sorry. He loved you like a brother. I'm so sorry. He was a great and honorable man. Who is he? Someone I used to know. Alpana, we have to go. We can't stay here, it's too dangerous. No. I will not go. You go. Are you sure? I, I... I can't leave you here. I will stay here. Where are Grace and Ethan? They are by the creek. I'll be back for you. Hey, you kids okay? Strange how a... How a cowardly wolf like myself... don't have the guts to tell two little kids how he feels. I just hope the two of you know how sorry I am for not being there for you and your mom. And you might not believe in me, but I, but I did write your mom a lot more letters than the ones you found. She never returned any of them, but... you two have been on my mind ever since. Ever since I walked out. Anyway, we'll get your mom back. Maybe... just maybe, I can convince her to take me back, and we can be a family again. What do you say? Does that sound like a plan? I... Anyway, nothing wrong with dreaming. You're one pretty little filly. No. No, no, no. I think she's the best blanket companion around. Ain't she, boys? Get her off the horse! Please, please, please, no! Please, no! No! - No! No! No! - Come on. Come on. No! Relax. You're gonna have a great time. Here you go, boss. No, please! Please, please. Believe me, little lady. You're gonna like it. Come on! Move! Move it! I don't have time for this, let's go. Now. Now listen! Quiet. Stop fighting me. Now listen. I want you to climb over that mountain. Tomorrow morning, there'll be a stage coming in. Carson will be driving it. Now get on that stage, he'll take you in safely. What are you... Why are you helping me? Who are you? That's not important. Here. This will help you get over the mountain. Now go, get out! Thank you, thank you! Oh, boys! Where's the woman? Just mount up, the party's over. What do you mean the party's over? She ain't fit for a drinking man. She slapped me, I killed her. You killed her? Ah, Briggs ain't gonna be liking that. It don't matter. - Now let's go, mount up! - Mount? "M-O-N-T"! Mount, now! Oh, boys. She killed you too. Frank! Is that you? Yeah, Paw. It's me. What the hell are you doing out here in the middle of my land? Long story. Put the rifle down and I'll explain it to you. Sure. Love what you've done with the place. Hey, Paw, long time. Ah, Frank! My favorite son. Hey, just keep your voice down, okay? Why? No one can hear us from miles around. Hey. Hey, whose are those? They, uh... Well, I think they're your grandkids. I told you, you ain't fit for adopting. It's a long story, but they're kin. Can you help me get them inside and I'll explain? Mm, sure. Come on. Come on. Ma'am, are you all right? You look like you're on the wrong coach. I'm fine, thank you. You can talk to us. We ain't afraid of no issues. There ain't nothing we haven't experienced. Young lady. I've been riding on this coach for three days, and I am sick and tired of your dribble. I didn't mean to start a fuss. I'm just trying to get back to my children. You ain't whorin'? I thought Mr. Carson stopped and picked you up 'cause you're going to town to work with us. No, ma'am. Uh... Then what are you doing on this coach? If it's all right with you, I'd rather not say. I'm the madam of the saloon that this here coach is heading to, so you best be telling me, or I'll tell Mr. Carson to pull over and we'll throw you out, and you can die in this godforsaken desert. I was kidnapped. You don't look like you've been kidnapped to me. I was kidnapped by my own husband. Your husband kidnapped you? That's exactly why I ain't ever getting married. I just use men for money. Ain't nothing a man's gonna do for me that I can't do for myself. All right, missy. That's enough, you hush up. You know, I think you might be right about that. Well, your children are the most important thing in the whole world. My parents didn't pay no attention to me, now I'm 18 years old, whoring all over the west. That's enough, you hush up! Or you're gonna be out with her. No more whoring for you. You have a daughter? Yes. Her name is Grace. Well, ma'am... I want you to go find Grace and educate her real good, so she don't end up like one of us. Okay? You seem like a good woman. I wish my mom were more like you. Those kids of yours are real lucky to have such a strong woman for a momma. Thank you. Jake! No! Die, you sons of bitches! What are you doing? Down, buddy! What are you doing? What are you doing? I hit at least three more of those blue bellies, they were mine! You're gonna get yourself killed! - Get us outta here, Frank. - Hey! Listen up! We got two other men left up there on the outside, haven't we? We're gonna go get them. He's empty, Frank, ain't going no place. We're gonna go get 'em. Gibson! Hey! We're gonna get on top of that hill and give us some cover, all right? Start firing down on those blue boys. You're gonna go get those boys on this side of the hill. You get up there and you start fucking firing, now. I ain't going no place, Frank. This ain't a fight, this is suicide. This command does not run from a fight, and we do not leave our men behind. Grow something that looks like a spine and you get up there, now! What the hell are you doing? Where are you going? Hightailing it out of here! You come back here, you yellow-bellied coward! What are you doing? Ow! Grace! Ethan! Woo-hoo! That's nice. You're a natural! Hey! Hold your fire! Hold your fire! Give me that! Give me that! Why'd you do that? Guns aren't for kids, okay? Well, Mr. Connor said that you owned your first gun at six years old. Well, things are different now. - Okay? - What's different? Seems to me nothing changed around here in the earth. I'm different. Okay? Besides, I've seen what these things can do when they fall into the wrong hands. Would you... Would you kids go inside, please? I need to talk to my pop. - I'm gonna beat you! - In your dreams. Ah, you showed them. Well, that's the way you taught me, I guess. Bluster. Anger. And listen, son, you... You have some bright kids there. Yeah. Now I'm just happy to find out I'm their grandpa. I just want to make sure you don't screw this up. I just want you to be a family again. I think you need to fix this, son. With all due respect, you just don't know what you're talking about. Look, Dad, that life... That life is dead. It's... It's gone. Okay? It's just... I can't. What the hell you talkin' about? Remember that, the man who knows how to die standing is the one who keeps it coming, you know that. What happened to you? He's a kid, okay? Will you look after them for a while? Leave them with me, that'd be all right. I'm the only one here for a hundred miles. Yeah. We're gonna make this right. All right. What the hell you mean she's dead? So the report is, Miss Powell was killed by one of the men when they were moving her. Where are you gettin' this from? Harrison, sir. Hmm. Bring him in. Harrison. What'd you do with my wife? Well, we were setting up camp. She had to relieve herself, so Sharperson took her over to some privacy. She pulled his gun and shot him. And she ran back where McCabe was making the fire, and she shot him. What about you? I was tending horses. When I heard the gunshots, I came running over, but she pointed the gun at me. I gave her a lead pill. I'm sorry, but it was her or me. Where's the body? I buried her. Left the other two for wolf bait. Don't worry. I said a prayer, over them. Easy, boys. I don't think I'm gonna let you kill me today. You lousy son of a bitch! Don't shoot, don't shoot! We'll never find his weapons if we kill him. Don't worry, sir, we'll get him. What the hell kind of rinky-dink operation are we running around here, huh? I'm truly sorry about your wife, sir. Are you some kind of idiot? I don't give a damn about my wife! You don't? I want Connor. Sir. I'm just not clear on why you want Connor so much, why you care about him so much right now. Frank Connor... works for a specific faction of our government, who's interfering with my distribution channels and killing 'em off! That is a major conflict of interest, and all-on war department. Do not let appearances fool you. Once we kill Connor, we cut off one of their major legs. But, sir... Why don't we just find out which department he's working with, and work it out? There is a faction of the government that is fucking with my business, and I ain't gonna stand for it! - And, whoa, whoa, whoa! - Whoa! You a friend of Harrison's? Are you Frank Connor? Yes, sir. I have a passenger for you. What's going on? Mr. Carson, why are we stopping? You keep this coach rolling. Heather. Uh... It's, uh... It's me, it's Frank. How? Where did you come from? How did you find me? Uh, well, um, I... I have the kids. I have your... Your kids, Grace and Ethan. You have Grace and Ethan? Where... where are they? Are they safe? They're at my father's house, they're safe. But we gotta go. Take me to them. Ma'am. I know you don't like me much. But please take care of that one for me. Would ya? Take me to my kids. Oh! Ladies. Come on. I tell you what, it's strange little Grace and Ethan showing up at my place, some story about how you'd been kidnapped, and you ain't been seen in a week, and they're all worried and think something happened to you. So, they asked for my help, that's all. Ain't no... Ain't no mystery to it. Well, I'm thankful that you have them and that they're safe, and I'm thankful that you are taking me to them now. - Yes. - So please do that. Look, I'm not trying to weasel my way - back in your heart, I... - Aren't you? - No, I... - Aren't you though? No, no. I'm just, look, I'm trying to help you out, is all. Take me to my children, that will help me a lot. Listen, Frank, I am very grateful. But you can't just come back in my life, into my children's lives like you weren't gone, a dead man for ten years. I'm not trying to get back in your life, Heather. I'm just trying to help you out. I'm not. I think you're misunderstanding me. I'm not misunderstanding anything. I had to create another life, Frank. I, I had to have stability for the children. - What was I supposed to do? - I know. I married Briggs, and he treated us terribly, but at least there was stability and food on the table, and a roof over our heads. So please forgive me if I'm a little bit hostile. Did he hit you? He provided for us. He put a, a roof over our heads and food on the table. That ain't what I'm asking you. Did he hit you? Heather, did he hit you? Frank, I just want to go see my children, please. I ain't letting him get away with that. What are you gonna do? Why are we stopped? I want to see my children! No, we're going back to the Compound. - What are you talking about? - We're going to the Compound. I'm not letting that man get away with that. What, we're going to see Briggs? - No, no, I wanna go see... - Yup. I want to go see my children! We'll get you to your children afterwards, but this is gonna end here and now. Come on. Frank! Captain McCalister. Back so soon. Cut the shit, Briggs. After your last little threat, one of my men did an inquiry into you and found out some interesting information about you and your little operation here. Let me stop you right there before you go too far and embarrass yourself. Mr. Briggs, it is time for you to stop with the lies, and stop with the stories. Now, I don't know how you rose to your position, although I have my theories. But aside from that, you are hereby under arrest for multiple infractions of the law. Firstly, for selling US government firearms to the hostiles! Arrest him. I don't think so! You best just back off. Go on, holster your weapons. Or I will shoot and kill your sweet, dear Captain McCalister. Are you sure this is the right thing to do? You can't walk away from this. I could do whatever the hell I damn well please, and I believe you are in no position to be making demands of me! What the hell are you doin', Briggs? Remember that faction I was telling you about, boys? Here it is. But, Briggs, sir. That's Captain McCalister, you can't, you can't do this. Sir, you shoot him, the whole operation goes to hell. Yeah, well, I'm doing it, boys. And now for my demands. Firstly, I want guaranteed safe passage south of the border to Mexico where my compadres will pick me up. And, secondly, I would rather have to not deal with this fool! Now would you both please get out there and do me the privilege of finding Connor! As soon as Frank Connor gets here, I will make the exchange. Then I suppose in the meantime... Captain McCalister and I will just wait patiently. What a country. A farm boy like me can rise to such high power! To be operating such a major operation. And the best part is, none of ya ever questioned me. Which is exactly why I'm the stud duck in this pond. Shoot him. Not bad, huh? Now while all of you are gonna be working hard trying to get the bad guys, I'm gonna be sittin' pretty in Mexico, making sweet, sweet love to some sexy señoritas and fandango-ing the night away. Cat got your tongue, Captain McCalister? Sir, I highly recommend you think twice about this. Please, think about everything you worked for. It's not the way to do this. Sir, please. No, you get the hell out of my way. - Damn it, Briggs! - No! Get back, all of you! This is my camp, and I want you to get the hell out of here! Briggs, calm down. Now, Feldman, you listen up! As soon as Frank Connor gets here, I want his hands tied behind his back. I want my horse ready to go! And then I will make the exchange. Well? How's that feel? One of your men dead, another done run off. You feelin' lonely? How does it happen, Mr. Briggs? How does a farm boy from Valdosta, Georgia, become... this? A disgrace to our country. It's pathetic. I got a bad feeling about this. You're gonna have to trust me. Why don't you run into that brush and hide. Don't be scared, I'll be back for you. Well, let me off the horse. Well, okay, then. You see what I see? Hold up, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yes, yes. Hold, hold, hold, hold, hold. Mr. Connor! What's going on? Well, it appears Briggs is looking for a dog to kick. He's got Captain McCalister hostage. He wants to switch him out with you. Y'all mind if I take care of some personal business? Be our guest. We're done. He's all yours, Connor. Come on. All you sons of bitches! - Get down, Connor! - What the hell are you doing? You're gonna get yourself killed! If you weren't wearing that uniform, I'd swear to God you're protecting them. Now get up there and start shootin'! That's just like you, Frank. Before you go into a canyon, you should know how the hell you get out. So that's what this is all about, huh? Go on, you kill yourself. Hi, Frank. Nice of you to join us. Show me you're not carrying a packing iron. All right. Henry, why don't you let that Captain go and you can have me. Come on, Frank. You know me better than that. Why would I let him go? Henry, you listen to me now. You let that Captain go. It's between you and me. But I don't want you, Frank. I want to kill you. Travis! What's this? An apparition of my dead wife? What the hell's going on, Travis? Where are you, what are you doing? You know this ain't gonna lead to nowhere good. You can let the Captain go, please. Frank, she never loved you. You done deserted her a decade ago. Matter of fact... She don't give a crap about you. Travis. You can end all of this right here, right now. You can end it all. Please, just stop. Let him go. Heather. Do you love me? Of course, I love you. You're my husband. You hear that, Frank? So run away with me. We'll go someplace nice. And the children? Sure. I'll send for 'em later. We'll live happily on top of a mountain somewhere. Oh, on a mountain. Okay. We'll send for the children later. Later. And maybe there will be a river... near the mountain. I like that. So you can just let the Captain go. I'm all yours. As a Captain in the US Army... I now sentence you to die. Heather! You're gonna be okay. Frank. Listen to me. I forgive you. I'm so sorry. You're gonna be okay, all right? And be strong for me. Can you do that for me? Yeah. Harrison, you used to be an army surgeon, right? I've mined some lead before. It's been a while, kid. It's gonna be all right. Hey. Hey. It's gonna be all right. I need you to be strong for me, all right, baby? Frank. Do us both a favor and go outside. Now, missy. You're gonna be okay. I'm gonna make a little incision, and then I'm gonna dig for that bullet. Now it's gonna be a pain you've never felt before. Hang on. You did good. You'll be okay. Hey. Is Ma gonna be all right? Uh, she's recovered, but she got hurt real bad. And, uh... Well, Harrison? Is she all right? She lost a lot of blood, but I patched her up. She's strong, she'll be okay. - When can we see her? - Soon. But remember, you need your mom, but your mom needs you. Harrison! Get over here. Excuse me. Grandpa told us everything. Yeah, Paw. Why don't you two go pick your momma some flowers, huh? I'm sure she'd like that. - Go on and get. - Yeah. Hey, kids, I got something outside for ya. Really, is she mine? She's yours and your brother's. - She's mine too? - Yup. Oh, my gosh! - Wow! She's so cute! - Oh, she's so cute! Aw! - Can't wait to ride her. - She's soft too! All right, who's gonna ride her first? I think I want to ride her, but I think I'd be too big. Aw. Yeah, go on ahead. Hop on. I want to ride her first, sis. Here, Ethan, get on it. Oh, she's so sweet! You gotta put more effort into it. Wow. It's way different from being on a normal horse. It's just a bit lower. - All right. - You gotta be careful with it. Come on, come on. - Yeah, just tug her along. - Come on. - Just gently guide it. - Gently. - Come on. - We love all God's creatures. Be nice. Look at that. You ever seen something so pretty in all your life? I missed you, Frank Connor. Hm. I never want to leave you ever again. Well, then, don't.
