I should've met him We were in Shanghai then In 1943. he was transferred to Canton Somehow I felt he tried to avoid me I yearned to know where he was The Gendarmerie asked me about my relationship with him As it was more than 6 months since I made the enquiries I told him he is a friend I made when I studied in Japan They asked me about the subject I took and I lied that is was medicine Anyway I'm now making a living as a wine merchant After debunking my secret. they asked if I graduated from Nagoya's No 8 Senior School and got a BA degree from the Imperial U Tokyo Obviously they knew I'm Yu Ta-fu They asked if Yu Ta-fu was my real name I complained that they'd wasted so much time finding that out without asking me They said they knew Yu Ta-fu is a famous writer I knew the more famous I was the more trouble I would be in I frankly told them my background when asked I lived in Tokyo in 1913 My brother was a judge in Peking assigned to inspect legal affairs in Japan As I. at 17 was unable to find a suitable school and had to study Chinese classics at home he took me to Tokyo to sit for an exam Don't disgrace us Chinese overseas Memorize these Don't overeat Japanese rice 1s hard to digest Wear clothes according to custom Be polite when going in or out of the room Pass water or defecate in utensils only Wear wooden clogs in the toilet only Don't wear foreign shoes when in a kimono ALUEO Ka.
