This film tells the story of a time as it must never happen again. The screenplay is based on historical sources and accounts of survivors The Final Act Your papers, Herr Hauptmann (Captain)! Hauptmann Wuest? Has just been sent for rapport, Untersturmfuehrer! Four men. Only two by now. Colonel Hartwig and one sergeant were killed by an aerial attack. Your arms, Herr Hauptmann! Still the 20th of July? Your papers! We are packing. Leaving for Berchtesgarden. Thanks! Is this the way to General Burgdorf? Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann! You wait in the canteen. Jawohl, waiting in the canteena. Hauptmann Wuest at your service to report to the Fuehrer. Colonel Hartwig and another man were killed by an aerial attack. I demand obediently to report to the Fuehrer instead. Considering the situation General Busse needs information urgently. Papers? Jawohl, Herr General. You are breaking the chain of command Herr General... General Busse has given me direct orders Allright, show me. Yes? Yes! I'll be there immediately. Herr General... The situation has become critical, especially in the Wriezen area Herr Wuest, I am informed. Wait for me in the corridor. The Fuehrer awaits me. I will see what I can do for you. Jawohl, Herr General. Snowy Rose Ten... yes, connecting to Snowy Rose One Major Wenner speaking Some Hauptmann Wuest has just entered the bunker Why is he here? Aha... thanks, over. Finally! It will start anytime.- I had troubles on my way. Everything ready for Kuland? - Yes, excellent! Doenitz provided the ships necessary for the transport back. Koller provides the Luftwaffe. The operation will take no more than fourteen days. We will gain 500,000 men to defend Berlin Great, the commanders of the 9th Army will be relieved. Any news from Busse? - Yes, a Hauptmann of his just arrived. He gave me this stuff here.- And what does he want? Troop enforcements. The Fuehrer took away his tanks and gave them to Schoerner The second line is made up of mere children, ammunition and gas are scarce. - The old story! He is afraid of being encircled. Indeed, he will be soon! If the Fuehrer allows the pull-out of the Kuland army we can enforce the 9th Army If it isn't gone by then! Berlin stays under German rule, Vienna will be again The whole of the German people is looking at you, warriors in the East and counts on your steadfastness and fanaticism on your arms and your leadership in order to drench the Bolshevik attack in a blood bath. This is today's Fuehrer order for the soldiers of the Eastern front. Within 14 days, the last man of the Kuland army can reach Stettin Enough, Jodl! And you, Keitel? Krebs? Burgdorf? It won't work this way, my genius Generals. You tell me to withdraw the Kuland army to support the 9th at the Oder. In order to defend Berlin I tell you, I am not defending but attacking! You tell me the withdrawal can be done within 14 days Jawohl, mein Fuehrer. I tell you: I will need this army in no less than eight days! Exactly here where it stands! At Kuland! I know, that you, as usual in the recent years... consider the situation as eminently dangerous To calm you down - I have not only expected this attack I have almost wished for it! Once the Russians march towards Berlin the trap closes behind their backs! The 9th from the West, Steiner from the North Wenk from the South The only way to escape will be towards Northeast where the Kuland army waits - which you Gentlemen want to throw into the water - and destroys them for good. It is impossible, mein Fuehrer, to maintain the Kuland army from a distance of 400 miles by the Navy and the Luftwaffe The army maintains itself! It is encircled! -That's what you say, Herr Jodl! But I say it keeps half a dozen of Russian armies in check! And if it will be annihilated? There are 500,000 men Then let it be annihilated to fulfill its fate! Why did you become officers? To receive medals? To become Generals? Gentlemen! One becomes an officer to die an honorable death. How sad that it takes a nameless private to tell you this. - Mein Fuehrer! About 50 officers are falling each day by now If you care to look at the reports, please. I hate reports! They only put sand into my eyes! How can you see the bigger picture? If nothing matters to you but captured lieutenants and destroyed vehicles? Stop bothering me with trivialities! Master the situation instead! I am not interested in what you cannot do. I forbid you this cowardly and petty defeatism! Withdrawals! Retreats! I hear of nothing else for months! Where is your sense of vigour? Or are you telling me how incompetent you are? Learn from the SS! Learn from me! Dismissed! How can he talk of a 'bigger picture' and not look at the number of destroyed vehicles? Not to mention the lieutenants. - Treating us like school boys! Herr General... Look, it's Busse's man! Get yourself a bed and try again tomorrow C'mon, spare a bottle of Cognac for me, I'll pay! Too late, it is all paid for, ask again at Berchtesgarden Packed your things already? Always fresh as a daisy and chirpy as a puppy, huh? Don't let him spoil your mood. We'll be in trouble soon enough. Lily calls Snowy Rose Tulip in need of Acacia Are you still talking? I cut! Herr Hauptmann, you must not receive any calls You must not even enter this room! Herr Hauptmann, may I speak to you? Yes, I am connecting! Are you still talking? Herr Major?- Busse sent you to report to the Fuehrer? Jawohl, Herr Major! - Cut the show! Stop saying 'Herr Major'! Is that an order? If you please: yes. One cannot be careful enough in here! It is not necessary with me. I know you. But in front of everybody else - Utmost caution, clear? - Jawohl, Herr Major! How long will you stay? No idea, I have orders to take a bed and wait until the Greatest Commander of All Time is in the right mood The bed comes in here, so I can watch over you! That you have different political opinions nobody must know! You shut up! I don't want to see you being put against the wall. A quite honorable place nowadays. Not for my brother! We have the same mother after all. But not the same father. You... know what to do. Jawohl, Herr Major. Mein Fuehrer! Fate has spoken! Roosevelt has died today! Victory! Victory! Victory. Achtung! Mein F?hrer - I announce the representatives of the Party, the government, and the Wehrmacht We salute you on this celebration day with a triple Sieg - Heil! Thank you. Thank you also for your presents. But today is no day to think about things like that. I have just left my working desk and in a few minutes I shall return to this working desk. I stand before you to tell you this: In these grave hours I need only one gift: Your unflinching fanaticism! We have had glamorous birthday celebrations Up in the glorious ballrooms of the Reichskanzlei Today we are down here, amidst bare walls But it is exactly this atmosphere that shows the iron-hard will of the German people! By a monumental act of strenuous effort it shall turn the wheel of history! So Germany shall rise to the top of Europe! That is our mission. And you, Gentlemen, are chosen to aid me in that mission. Thus I ask: What are you waiting for? For me? I am here! I am here, as never before! I tell you: As Fate itself guides my steps as Fate has judged that war-monger Roosevelt so that all the world may see so Fate will provide that Berlin will become Russia's Stalingrad! Thank you. Mein Fuehrer! In the name of the Wehrmacht I have to bring forth a request Your moral strength and your will will guarantee our victory! Please spare us the dread to see you here in Berlin exposed to the risks of combat and move your main quarter to the South! We must consider a possible unification of American and Russian armies Germany would be split in two parts in such a case. The Southern part would be far more suited for a counter-attack You dare suggesting this. After I have demanded fanaticism from you. Is this your birthday present? Flight. Flight! A tactical displacement must not be adressed as 'flight'. Yes, it is. It would be an admission that the war is lost. Is it lost, Speer? Jawohl, mein Fuehrer. So! Speer. The civilian. The artist. Your very dress is a symbol of lacking courage I suppose everybody thinks like him? Gentlemen- Your reaction to my words finally proves to me how right I have always been. Hereby your troops are under the command of SS-Obergruppenfuehrer Steiner! Steiner will attack this very night! And as for myself, Gentlemen - - and that is my unflinching decision! - I shall stay in Berlin! At the gates of the Reich's capital Russia will suffer the greatest defeat of her history! You are doing what is right, mein Fuehrer! I came to you with empty hands because my present is the fanatical belief of a young generation that passed its baptism of fire today! Mein Fuehrer! Hereby I present a division of young, dedicated soldiers and I ask you to reward these heroes personally Colonel Scholl and seven men obediently at your service! Men of Germany! I am full of pride and joy to see you on my day of celebration and reward your courage! Grenadier Schalke charged a Russian T-34 by his own initiative and successfully stopped it. How old are you, boy? -Thirteen, mein Fuehrer! How was it like? Well... I... Where was your company? Company? There was no company anymore. So it was a platoon? Jawohl, mein Fuehrer! We lay in the street, when the tank approached We had to shoot, or it'd have turned us to jelly 'Turned us to jelly'! Grenadier Luschke! Grenadier Bergmann. Grenadier Goerlitz. Wounded?- Jawohl, mein Fuehrer. Send him to the bunker hospital! Grenadier Weiss. He always loved children. Especially in uniform. Dismissed! What's next for the boys? - Defending Berlin of course! These camps must be cleared now, the Americans will arrive anyday. Question: How can we remove 50,000 prisoners without any space for transportation? It will be less than 50,000. My records say so. - I say, there will be less. 10, 000 are quite a lot already. You mean, we should order directly-? No, no. Why should we? We can rely on the lower departments. Out of 50, 000 inmates, only 10,000 will be moved. And they can walk by foot. And those who can't - By the way, I almost forgot. For the Fuehrer just in case - Do you understand? Just whom we waited for.- Let him stare! Don't worry about him, girl! Just look at his face. - What a sourpuss. He can't stand us having fun. "I know, miracle is gonna happen..." (Zarah Leander song) Don't be so squirmish, join the fun! Dear and estimated audience! Next, the freshly imported international dancing duo Gustav & Co! 'Co' is my partner, Anita. A negro broad who eats lizards and snakes Everybody listen! Berchtesgarden is cancelled. We are all staying in Berlin. That's it. We are caught in the mouse trap. Well, then get the goods ready! It doesn't matter anymore. Let's get wasted! Champagne, anyone? Or a lobster? Bring the booze! I need a license, I can't do without. Shall we leave the goodies untouched, then? Good day, Doctor! How... are you? Busse has arrived! Wuest! Where is Hartwig? Colonel Hartwig is dead, I had to take over. What have you achieved? I spoke to Keitel, Krebs, Jodl and Burgdorf, but- Rubbish! I could have done that on the phone! I don't need to send you to Berlin for that. You must try it the other way around. You have to see the Fuehrer and tell him that everything depends on the enforcement Herr General - Stop the excuses, I want you succeed And success means only one thing: The 9th army will be removed from the Americans and sent off to support the Eastern front, understood? Jawohl.- You are no wet towel, you wear the Knight's Cross! Succeed, no matter how! If you don't, the army will go to hell! Over! Jawohl, General, succeed, no matter how, over! What does he say? I shall do everything to reach the Fuehrer directly. So Wenk's army will be moved to the East. But it is too late! Everybody knows Steiner is a paper tiger. Don't you know he has no more troops left? Yes, I know. But it makes no difference whether I do or not. My job is not leading Germany, but this information unit. I will do my job, until somebody else takes over. Or absolves me of my oath. End of discussion. What will you do now? Try it the other way around, as Busse put it so neatly. Talk with his secretary, talk with his adjutant... Why do you ask? An order is an order! Excuse my intrusion, Obersturmbannfuehrer. But you are the Fuehrer's adjutant. I need your help. I'm at the end of my wisdom. First advice: use the door, not the window. Cigarette? You allow smoking? I command it! So, what's up? I have direct orders of General Busse to see the Fuehrer How nice. And so simple. Why? The 9th army. We are getting their daily reports. - So? Are you aware we are outnumbered 10:1 at Wriezen? If the Russians break through, they'll be in Berlin quickly. And then the city is done for! Why didn't you report this?- We did, ten times at least! The supreme command knows it better and removes our tanks Listen, the Fuehrer would... - The Fuehrer! I see dozens of Generals, but never the Fuehrer! Well, these fine Generals! Come again in two hours. I'll announce you to the Fuehrer. I promise you will see him. Goodbye. See? Finally a man from the front, and they keep him off. Those fine gentlemen! Did you hear that? These are no bombs, but artillery. - Impossible, you are crazy. It's just a single battery!- Artillery alone cannot break through. Has the railway been fired at? - Impossible! One can hear it, calibre 12.2, long-distance guns You better find an agreement about what it is actually Watch out for your answer! I demand an explanation! Why is Berlin under fire? Where is Steiner? I've been asking for hours, yet nobody can tell me where he is. Go and call Koller! He shall immediately find this battery and destroy it! We might as well search for a needle in the hay. Hey, you! Is that artillery fire?? Jawohl, Herr General! Already now? Why? The Russians have taken Bernau and Strausberg and have reached Landsberg forest. That is an air-line distance from the Reichskanzlei of just 10 miles That's close enough for a long-distance battery Landsberg forest, allright. What about Steiner? The Fuehrer wants Steiner! Damn! What does Steiner say? He says, he can't attack without troops The supreme command has taken one division after another from him now all is used up. You think, Steiner has...? Not even started to attack. We can't possibly tell him this! - Herr Feldmarschall! The Fuehrer awaits you. Off the wall they go, one after another. The Americans are lining up on a demarcation line in Havelberg area Not more than that - so we don't need the 12th Army. In the area of the 9th Army, Soviet tanks... - Cut the blabbering. I want to know, where Steiner stands. At Liebenwalde, mein Fuehrer. So! At Liebenwalde! That's where he was yesterday too. And the day before yesterday, and the day before... Is that an attack? Why so quiet, Gentlemen? Why is he still at Liebenwalde? Why not at Werneuchen? Has the attack broken down? The army destroyed? Open your mouth! Mein Fuehrer.... Steiner has never started to attack. 'Never started'... 'Never.... started.' The SS too, then. The SS too has betrayed me. Mein Fuehrer, the SS has not betrayed you. Guensche! Leave us alone. 'Fuehrer'! 'Fuehrer'! I am no 'Fuehrer' of cowards who is being lied to by idiots and scoundrels! It is an open secret that this Wehrmacht was never worthy to be led by ME. But the SS...! In the SS I still have believed! But that is over now! Cowards! Traitors! Criminals! All of them! All! This army- rejected the opportunity I granted to gain immortal glory! It is nothing but a bunch of cowardly traitors! I don't want to be its leader anymore! The war is lost! It makes no sense anymore! Go. I put down my leadership. Let somebody else take over. I will put an end to my life. I can't let you go with that arm. And there is no vacation here. Not even a way out. Your mother lives at Roon Street, no? There is a hospital at Marien Street, nurse. I will give you your packages. You will hand them over over there. Your ID papers are stamped with today's date. You will be back until noon, understood? Jawohl, Herr Doctor! I'll be back at noon. Your word? Ouch! It's true, the rascal has permission to leave! Where you wanna go? - It's written here: Home! Richard! I thought it was the doctor. - Do you know where my mother is? Mother is really sick. Father got a special permission to leave. He is one day over time, and still has no hospital place. The few civilian hospitals are all full. People are lying on the floors. You really don't know where my mother is? Your mother? No. I don't. They went all away. Father has stayed. He doesn't dare to carry mother, with no doctor present. She could... Johann! Help me. I am going now. I will find a doctor, I promise to you. And he will come with me, you can rely on that. Just a few minutes, Maria. Frau Panke! Do you know where my mother is? Look, it's Richard. So they put you in a uniform too. - I cannot find my mother. She is with your brother. With Josef? He is in Berlin? Yes. They say he is wounded. He is at the S-Bahn train station with the others. Everybody is at the S-Bahn. Only that Knight's Cross guy is still up there. That's no "guy", Frau Panke. The major is a noble fellow. I know him from long ago. You must not say anything against him. He is a decent man all through! I'll see you at the S-Bahn, OK? - OK. May I ask for your papers, Herr Major? Have you got the bacon? -Yes. Mother! - Richard! Josef, old boy, what happened? Both paddles! Where do you come from? - From Kuestrin. We have been chosen to see the Fuehrer. I can see how manly and grown-up you feel Calling my arms 'paddles', talking like a real soldier What a great leader, this Adolf, sending children to the slaughter. You over there, what did you just say? Nothing, he is feverish and wounded I have heard what he said. I will report this! - Just go ahead. He doesn't know what he is talking about, can't you see? Look at him! You know how people talk when they are despaired. Despaired? Despair is high treason! It is my duty to report this. Your name? I understand. And you - he offended you. What's his name? He is my brother. Maybe, but... we are all brothers in here. United in the mission of the German people. What's his name? Richard, why don't you tell this rat my name? He's more of a brother than I am, your rat brother. You have heard it too, didn't you? Nothing at all. - Don't lie! You heard it! Nope. But you have! - I don't know anything. What? But you! And you! I have heard you say that the war is lost. W-what? Me?? Sure! And that there's no vigour left in the German people! You impudent rascal! - Richard! He is totally right. That's just what you said! I heard it with my own ears. Am I right, Frau Stepke? - Of course he has! And what's your name? - This is outrageous! Buzz off, will you? Don't you realize nobody needs you? Scram, you laughable old geezer! I insist on law and order! All of you will have to answer for this! Buzz off! Oh, Herr Wuest. I didn't work out. The Fuehrer has had a nervous breakdown. He cannot see anybody. I'm sorry.... but I won't forget. We have been sitting like this for hours. It can't go on like this. Somebody must give orders. - Well, he won't listen to us anymore. We are on our own now, are we? He said, let somebody else take over. We could.... I mean: You, Keitel, could.... No way. And you?- Out of question. The Fuehrer lays down his command. If only Rommel lived to see that! Let's rather not talk about Rommel! Even in circumstances like this we as soldiers have no right to make political decisions. I see only one way, Gentlemen. We must get the Fuehrer back. We will go and see him again I will cite historical examples I will talk of heroism and how the Nibelungen saga is the German people's destiny And in the end I will say: Behold your last faithful stalwarts. Put yourself ahead of them and lead us to the final outbreak which will not give us the liberty of life but the liberty of honorable death on the battlefield And history's eternal glory. - Is that all what you can propose? Mein Fuehrer, am I not talking according to your will? You do not! What do you think would happen if I would not get killed but merely wounded? And fall alive into the hands of my enemies? That is unthinkable, Jodl! They'd put me in a cage! They would drag me to carnivals, put me on display for money That's what your pretty ideas will lead up to, you.... hopeless theoretician. Rather stick to your tactics. I won't head for an outbreak! We stay in Berlin! Berlin must be kept! Your proposals - The Americans stopped at the Elbe Now we could withdraw Wenck's troops from the Elbe and make them march towards Berlin Wenck. That would be very good. Americans and Russians would meet on a broad front line and we would stand apart in the North. And Wenck could join Reimann at Potsdam. That would add up to a considerable force Wenck. Yes, Wenck. There could be a possibility. No, that IS the possibility. Keitel, you go to Wenck at Wiesenburg. Burgdorf, you pick some officers as charge them with the undertaking Jawohl, mein Fuehrer! I expect your proposals in two hours. Have you seen the Fuehrer? No. Greater German Reich's diva has had a nervous breakdown Likely because of Steiner. Well. I guess you'll never see him. Why not? Because Busse is done for. Encircled. Finished. I'm sorry. 'If you fail, the army will go to hell.' Then I have to leave. - You can't possibly go back! Between Busse and us are the Russians. It doesn't matter. Anywhere else. Where responsible men are and no Generals and above all no politics and no Fuehrer No outbacks left anymore, just front lines all over Pull yourself together. It's not your fault. - Who else then? So you admit that HE is to blame. - He has just bad advisors. And why? Why does he keep these slimy yes-men? Because he can't stand the truth. Hiding in his concrete bunker, playing 1000 year Reich while Germany is croaking. Why? Because he is a coward! Have you ever heard of a supreme commander hasn't even once seen the front during six years of war? Who has not even once seen a city bombed to pieces? Pulling down the curtains of his limousine so he won't see any ruins? That's how he is. That's how you all are. 'The Greatest Commander Of All Times", huh? His gestures of genius are enough to move imaginary armies over his map, thousands of miles And five wimpy generals stare at him and say 'Jawohl, mein Fuehrer'! And you with your telephones transmit this criminal nonsense You have sworn an oath after all. Then you lay down in your beds while thousands die in the real world! Goodbye, Herr Major. Can't you convince the boss to leave for Berchtesgarden? That's not my business. He stays, and he knows what he's doing. As always... for him, there is no reason to leave anyway. He will be recognized everywhere. But me? You could really help me to escape to Bavaria. But you are Himmler's representative! So what? I'm doing nothing that's important. Meanwhile your sister in Bavaria is expecting a child... Now listen, Hermann! You won't betray the Fuehrer, will you? Come on, Eva darling! - You will remain loyal? Unto my death! But I can die in Bavaria as well. Do you still believe in victory? Unswervingly! Then you might as well stay. We are staying too. (spelling) R- J - O - F- N - X R - X - N Herr Major, here are the latest news about the Americans 55, 135 equatorial distance Go ahead.- 45, 706 706? You mean 406, no? Seven - Zero - Six, Herr Major! Torgau. The Americans and Russians have united. Why are you so terrified? It's all according to the big plan! Or have you imagined it otherwise? You petty disbelievers! A tiny backlash, and everybody is losing his guts! It has all been planned for years, see?? The Fuehrer always knows what he is doing. What do you mean? Exactly what I said, It'd be high treason otherwise. You can read it tomorrow in the latest issue of "Attack!" Dr. Goebbels will explain it to you. Berchtesgarden is finished for good. - What shall we do now? The Fuehrer assured you, the final battalion will be German. And he always keeps his promises. You can all join this battalion now! I won't. What do you mean?? How dare you??? You are talking to a Knight's Cross bearer! Straighten up! Stand still! Let's sing. 'We were close to Madagascar, and had the plague on our ship..." Louder! In the middle of Germany they join their dirty hands. Torgau... the place of your victory. And I shall perish by it. I had my Czarina die, too. But she has no son who idolizes me this time. It will take only five seconds... Five seconds can be very long. Too long! There is a shorter way. Just because these dogs have encircled me. Dogs! That's what they are. If they were honorable enemies at least... but they are just race-less subhumans And the Jews! This pestilence... these vermin. Covering the planet with their slimy web Unbelievable. Always evasive... I let too many of them get away. I should have exterminated them. Exterminate them, to the last suckling! There should be a weapon which would require just the push of a button to blow up the whole world. And by God, right in this moment I would not hesitate and atomize this damned globe full of human scum You... why don't you tell me? Tell me! Tell me what to do! Tell me! Go tell me! Mein Fuehrer... an important message! Conflicts between Americans and Russians, even at their first encounter! Tomorrow they'll shoot at each other! The enemy broadcast confirms it. I knew it. I ... knew it. You see? Victory will be mine! Just as it was yours! I will save my Germany! I will build up my Germany! A new Germany! A Germany of my kind, of my spirit, of my taste! A Germany, bigger, better and nobler than ever before! A Germany as I promised to you! MY.... GERMANY. (Cardboard: 'Deserter') Jutta! He is no deserter. He just wanted to get a doctor. He was dispensed from the front because of his injury. And he went by his own free will. Just because he stayed one more day with Mum. Upstairs. She sent me to look for father. We must take him off. I have to go now, Jutta. They expect me at the bunker. But I'll be back. I promise. So, who is going to take this hot iron in his hands? What about this Hauptmann Wuest? Why don't you let him do it? Excellent idea. You should get a medal for that. - Wuest, of course. Let him crack the nut. Never mind. You look miserable. Get yourself a schnaps from the canteen. What's up, can't you watch out? Bend your knees! Up! Down! Up! Down! We'll make a man out of you. Jump! Go ahead! Are you unwilling or unable? Get up. Pardon me. Two Cognacs, please. At ease. Cheers! Breathe deeply! I didn't tell you to cough but to breathe deeply. Why are you looking at me like that? The major... he had the Knight's Cross as well. - What major? They hanged him. In front of our house. Hanged.- A quick trial by the patrol, possibly. If they deem somebody fishy, he hangs on the next lamppole. Hauptmann Wuest! Yes? - General Burgdorf wants to see you! You are hereby assigned for special disposal at the main quarter. Task: processing of all incoming reports considering Wenck's army. 'Are you accepting my proposal to take over the leadership of the Reich?' 'If there is no message from you by 10 p.m. I'll assume you have been taken in custody...' 'Signed: Hermann Goering.' A rat, believing that the ship is already sinking... This ridiculous drug addict, whom nobody takes serious anymore Don't waste your time on him. Don't you want to refute this ultimatum? It would look better with four diamonds. The Reichsmarshall's telegram is an ultimatum, mein Fuehrer! Ultimatum. I don't tolerate ultimatums. If you please look again at the second paragraph... How can he be as stupid as that? 'If there is no message from you by 10 p.m....' That is clearly an ultimatum! It means: if you, mein Fuehrer, do not react until 10 p.m he is going to dispose you. That fat sloth, he would vegetate in filthy bars without me He wouldn't even have gotten as far as major. And I make him Reichsmarshall. You have to act, mein Fuehrer. There is no other way. - Put him under arrest! Yes. Arrest. Away with him. Greim will get his post. Greim shall report to me. Arrest Goering. Strip him off of all his titles. Put Generaloberst Greim in his place. Order him to report Berlin. Make sure that all caught US terrorist pilots will be shot. The same goes for all commanders of fortresses, who failed Close all interpreter schools and shoot all interpreters. I have always hated them. Who speaks two languages is not reliable. And the public, mein Fuehrer? How to make it understand why the Reichsmarshall... I prefer four diamonds. Greim will never get through. But we reached him? Yes, cost us 30 fighter planes. What? 40 were sent off for escort, 30 have been taken down. How beautiful. Imagine the mothers of these pilots. Died right before closing time so Greim can join this loony bin. That's what I call a heroic death. Stork calls Snowy Rose I count so you can tune me in: 1, 2, 3... Specify your location. Answer! News from Greim? No, Herr Major. No message since five minutes. No signal. Another one gone. He was a good guy. What did you expect? One liasion plane against 100 fighters... He will get an honorary grave at Charlottenburger Chausee... I connect, I call Hage... Line is busy, try later, I cut Minister Goebbels' apartement? I call! Who? Who?? Kids, listen to this! (Russian voice) Uncle Adolf! Thank you, Holde! Hilde. Helmut. We left our house, in order to triumph or die with you. And the children? They shall share our fate. They are too precious to live in a time when you, mein Fuehrer, will be no more. I have worn this medal - for many years. Nobody has earned it more than you, Magda. The most glowing example of a German wife and mother. Greim broke through! He is wounded.- He really got it. - Hey, me too. What's happening? What does he say?- Greim is here. -He really made it?? I have ordered you to come here... to advance you personnally to General Field Marshall and supreme commander of the Luftwaffe. To tell me this - Luftwaffe, Luftwaffe... there is no Luftwaffe anymore. From the little that's left, 30 fighters have been shot down during my flight I have just been outside. It's over. It's finished. - Courage! Greim! I saw it. Germany Smoke, ruins, smoke, ruins... Bombed streets Corpses, corpses, corpses... A desert A graveyard Allow me to die in here. Is that all, Greim? I know you think I'm crazy But I'm not. I see the situation all-too clearly. And still - it is right there where I see a new beginning. All great things were born out of disaster All glory was born out of destruction The tide will turn, Greim! Why did fate shield me from all danger until now? This is history's Iron law! And were I not an embodiment of this law I would have died long ago. That I am here... I! That I AM HERE proofs that I have a mission. But the Russians are just a few miles away from the Reichskanzlei. - It must be this way! Do you think it was my stupidity that let them get so close? The Russians at Berlin! Do you know what that means for the West? I withdrew Wenck, so the unlikely allies would meet on a broad frontline But Wenck - has 100,000 enthusiastic, fanatic, young soldiers at his command An army, insufficiently equipped? Outnumbered by ten to one? Against elite troops? With tanks... airplanes... gas.... ammunition.... I know, I know... but I'm telling you: Wenck will reach Berlin! While on his way, Americans and Russians will start to fight each other by the gun Until then we must defend Berlin! We are the ones to tip the scale. In the end we will dictate our conditions. Be it America or Russia the one, whom we will help will have to pay our price. And the price will be Europe. Do you understand now, Greim? Do you understand, that even a weakened air force can help? We are closer to Final Victory than three years ago! I'm not making any insane demands. I know you can't bomb Moscow, Paris or New York. I don't ask for that! I just need your help to defend this city. You must liberate Berlin. And myself. Yes. Mein Fueher. - You will fight, Greim. Fight! Fight! - Jawohl, mein Fuehrer. Wenck and you - are the pillars upon which I will build my Europe. Europe. Europe! Europe. Jawohl. Mein Fuehrer. Mein Fuehrer. Important news! Read it. -Mein Fuehrer. It's...- What's up? Go ahead, read. - It's... Why don't you read? London and New York report that negotiations were made between Count Bernadotte and the Reichsfuehrer-SS Himmler offered a separate peace to the Western forces He deemed his step legitimate as Adolf Hitler is either dead or will be within 24 hours the most. That's loyalty. Loyalty. Loyalty. Loyalty. What are you waiting for? Take your gun and shoot me down. Is there poison in my food? Has Goebbels already reported my death? Everything is possible now,no? You are from the SS too, aren't you? SS! First Steiner now Himmler tomorrow Guensche. We took our oath on you, not on the Reichsfuehrer-SS We shall all remain loyal unto death. - Unto death, yes. My death... don't you dare to come closer! Go! Go! Go already! Stop! Is not his representative in here? Get me Fegelein. Get me Fegelein! Obergruppenfuehrer Fegelein! Sorry, we don't serve that anymore. Obergruppenfuehrer Fegelein is not in the bunker. Not in the bunker. Not in the bunker. So he ran away. Arrest him! Search every house, every cellar for him! Every channel... arrest, arrest.... Arrest, and bring him to me! Arrest, you hear me? From now on no one must leave without my special permission Everybody who opposes me will be shot immediately Shot Immediately! - Jawohl! No one leaves the bunker! Somebody must leave this city, find Himmler... Arrest him and have him shot! Shoot Himmler! Shoot, you hear? Shoot! - Jawohl! Greim will leave the city, and shoot Himmler! Greim flies to the West, this is an order! Greim flies to the West and shoots Himmler! This is an order! This is an order! This is an order! They got him, over. - They are bringing him. Where was he? - In his apartment. Why no uniform? - I don't know. Can you tell me, why I am being treated like a criminal? I have no idea. Report you to the Fuehrer, uniformed. - Uniformed? So it's not that bad after all. You... If your boss commits treason, you have to follow him, huh? I had no intention to... - Your intention was to desert! Just as Schuetze Mayer did Because the war lasts too long You just wanted to desert a little Mein Fuehrer, I was about to return, I needed to see Gretel, she's having her child any moment! She is Eva's sister after all.- Don't speak out this name while begging for your pathethic life! Everything you are, you are because of me! And now you are heading for a last-minute escape You have my word of honor... - Honor!! You, the lowest scum of all! You have no honor! You traitor! Slimy traitor, just like Himmler! Whom you represent, right until the end You thought I was dead already, didn't you? Herr Fegelein! Herr Himmler! Herr Judas, with thirty silver dollars You will die before I do. Flail-elein, Himmler! Judas! I will die. This instant, you will die. You have only a few minutes left. A few minutes. Away with him. Shoot him. Do me this single favour. Send this paper to Fraulein Braun. You can do this, can't you? Two minutes. You know, this my precious time. You hear? Fraulein Braun can do nothing for you. Nothing for me... Can do nothing for me... The war is over, isn't it? The war is over and you know it! The Fuehrer will shoot himself today or tomorrow! So why me? Why me? Let me go in two hours! All will be over in two hours! You can't shoot me two hours before it's all over! Be a man. Go. - This is madness. The war is over! It's madness! The war is over! So the Russians are just 2,000 yards aways. They could also approach through the tunnels of the subway and the S-Bahn By these tunnels they could reach the Reichskanzlei in no time Blow up these tunnels! Wait, that's not enough. They could remove the rubble and climb across We must make them unusable for a longer time. Let's blast them at several places. - That won't make it any better. There is a much better way. The Spree!- The Spree? -Yes! We have two spots where the subway line crosses the Spree We must put the explosives here! The river will flood the tunnel making any progress impossible Yes, but... the tunnels are used by the people as air raid shelters. There are also many hospital facilities. They must be removed. I can't wait that long! We could manage in two or three hours... - Two or three hours?? I can't take such a risk. While we evacuate, the Russians will get us. - We could get the tunnel defended. We could put up a few anti-tank weapons. - What for?! Are you crazy? This is our strongest point of resistance! No, no, we will flood the tunnel! The biggest problem is that the rubbles might block the water. I need a savage flood, that will take only a few minutes. - But... Such a flood will drown thousands of civilians. - So what? That's no objection! The best of our people have already died on the battlefield. What is left after six years of war is just rubbish You can't just sweep them away. - Of course we can. A few thousand lives more don't matter anymore. And the women, mein Fuehrer? Burgdorf, you will guarantee that the tunnel will be flooded Jawohl, mein Fuehrer. - Very well. Send some more ammunition to Naumann, though he doesn't do as well as he should. Axmann is the only one I am pleased with. These 14 year old boys! Have proven extraordinary vigour! How many casualties? -500 out of 5000 left. That should teach a lesson to the grown-ups . All they can think of is their own dirty little life. The explosives will handed out to you. - Jawohl, Herr General. Come closer. The tunnel must be blasted here and here. Take care that the rubbles will not to block the waters. Confirm the operation until dawn. You are going outside. Can't you take me with you? What are we gonna do? - Blow up the S-Bahn. - Why? To make the Spree flood it and drown the Russians Oh boy! - Shut up. - Hey, you! The tunnel is full of wounded and women. So what? They will get away in time. But... my mother is down there as well. Take me with you. Please! Count! - 1! 2! 3!.... 8, through! Pick it up! Forward march. I have always believed, deeply and purely... in the Fuehrer. The idea... Germany... but... but this thing with the tunnel... You must stop this order. Listen, think about this objectively and cut the human sentimentality If we are able to blow up the tunnel and let the Spree flood it while the wounded are not evacuated yet. What do you think will happen? They will drown of course! Right, they will drown. Now think a bit further. The war is lost, we know that. Chaos will follow, we know that too. Isn't it better if the people are spared this? - No, no... We must not talk this way. It's not ours to decide. It's inhuman! - Inhuman? A nice word, must be invented by the ministry of propaganda Just... just to let them drown... Schnaps is bad for you, stop drinking, if it weakens you Inhuman? Life in general is inhuman. Right from the beginning you kill to stay alive yourself Even as a vegetarian you have to murder plants on a daily basis What deserves our pity more than a nice, decent cabbage? Or the little Grenadier Gottlieb Mueller... - No, no... Cut it. You won't convince me that it is right to drown women and wounded people. What's wrong with you? You'd be better off at the salvation army. And you are serving at the General staff of Hitler. Now, that changes a lot. Did we ever live according to the bible? There is just one law... the law of the strongest. He had Roehm shot... He raced Udet to his death, put the gun on Rommel's desk He is to blame for the death of millions. I think he has no conscience at all. Conscience is weakness. Believe me, weakness. I can hear the waters gargling... Then calm yourself with this. And deal with the fact that we won't be regarded as saints. We rose up by blood, we lived by blood... and we will croak in blood. Cheers to that! To croaking! - No, I refuse. I won't drink to this. Then drink to blood, Mr. Grief. No. I... I only ever drank to victory. Always to victory. And now... Now! Burgdorf... we sent the boys into their deaths by thousands. At this very moment they are dying on the streets... for nothing. Nothing... nothing! And if we... must ever answer to this Answer? To whom? We can answer to the Fuehrer. And after the war the victors we won't live to see them. Take your gun... a brief pressure of the index finger Klick! There goes your answer. - Yes, but... on the other side? Nonsense! We will see. If HE really exists. Who the hell you mean? God. Nope. He doesn't exist. Because if he did, we wouldn't. By the way, Krebs, strictly among us... when I was a boy, I wanted to become a priest I would, but my old man wouldn't allow it. Me, a priest! Imagine! Me, a priest! - Stop laughing, Burgdorf! We must stop this order, understand? Stop the order! Stop the order? - Yes? Too late anyway, The platoon went off an hour ago. This is pure murder. Look at that. 300 casualties on single day at Scharnhorst division The Russians at Beelitz with 50 tanks, counterattack failed. 17 year olds, fighting against walls of steel with their bare hands and few bazookas. So Hitler has a few more hours to live. No answer, Herr Major?- What shall I say? You are right. Are orders all that matter? One cannot say 'Jawohl' all the time. I have to go. - To the Fuehrer? They won't let you pass. Today they will. Today, yes. Herr General! I have asked you a week ago to report personally to the Fuehrer. Yes? - So far I haven't seen him. Great. Bad Luck. After that you ordered me to take care of Operation Wenck. I remember...- As Wenck succeeded, I failed again to see the Fuehrer. The General has personally reported to the Fuehrer. Are you drunk? - Certainly not me, Herr General. Are you crazy?! - News just came through, that Wenck's attack broke down. Wenck... broken down. Pha, what else did you expect? That was clear from the start. Come, Krebs. Will you allow me to break the news to the Fuehrer myself? As no success is concerned, but the end. - Wenck. That means... - Yeah, yeah, we all know what that means. We knew it ever since. And Herr Wuest has put it so accurately. Great idea, you reporting yourself. I will announce you immediately. Finally you'll get to see the Fuehrer. My cordial congratulation! Just a little patience, and you will get what you ask for. Herr Hauptmann! They are blowing up the tunnel. My mother... my brother... they can't do that. At the S-Bahn... where all the wounded are... everybody will drown. - Who is blowing it up? The SS! They have parted already, and they won't let me go... I must warn my mother.... I must. Go already! Come on! You wait for me here. I'll be back immediately. Hauptmann Wuest reporting about the Wenck army. Mein Fuehrer, is it true that the S-Bahn tunnel is about to be blown up? Yes. Where is Wenck? Yes? - Yes. But are you aware that the tunnel is packed with wounded? With women and children? - How is that your business? Answer my question. What about Wenck? Wenck's army does not exist anymore. Doesn't exist anymore? It never has. It was just a phantom of your imagination. Berlin is lost. The death of the people in the tunnel is no sacrifice, but murder. Wenck exists... what nonsense is this? Wenck marches... Wenck will liberate Berlin. - Nothing can stop our defeat. We must surrender. - Surrender?? Never... never... It is about Germany. It must cease to be bombed and devastated. I have ordered its destruction! Its complete destruction! You don't exist anymore! You shouldn't exist anymore! The Slavs shall rule over you. You are not worth it... let no stone be unturned. A field of ruins... a desert shall remain. Come on doll, let's get to know each other. Just watch out. Let him play. What happened to the Hauptmann? You see, if officers drink to much, they need a doctor We have to vomit all by ourselves. Tell the guard to check for the marriage registrar. Medic, the doctor! No wonder, he hasn't slept for days. Administrator Wagner? No, not yet. Just 50 tanks left, and we have to give away one more just to deliver this stupid bunch We got hit very badly on our way We left the corporal at the door, nobody can help him now. Bring the boy into the hospital And this is the precious parcel we were supposed to deliver Man,you are being expected, come on. Dear bridal couple It is my duty to accept your decision to marry. I ask you hereby - mein Fuehrer - to earnestly take the present Fraulein Braun as your wife. Yes. Fraulein Eva Braun is it your true will to accept the present bridegroom - our leader Adolf Hitler - as your husband. Yes. Thus, in the name of the Greater German Empire I legally declare you husband and wife. Concerning your marriage, this certificate has been prepared and this certificate I bid you to sign at the marked spaces. Come with me, I have work to do. I have decided to end my life by my own will because I have realized that the German people is unworthy of me. Write. My political testament. I wish I'd have lived to see peace. You will. Do you know, what peace is? If you get it let it never again get taken away from you. Stay alert. Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann. Don't say 'Jawohl.' Never ever say 'Jawohl' again. This is how the whole mess started. Stay alert. Is he dead? And me... I am to blame. No. You are not. But still he died for you. Always remember him, if you get out of this alive. But not the Hauptmann with the Knight's Cross Think of him as your brother. Big Richard and little Richard. A brother is worth more than anything. There is nothing above him. No idea no people no nation and certainly no Fuehrer Your brother A single human being is the most precious thing on this earth Now the scum is coming to the surface Lights off! - Shut up. Music! Turn the ventilator off, it stinks in here. Do it yourself, you shit of a General. - What was that?? 'We'll keep on marching, while the world falls to pieces...' 'because today Germany is ours, and tomorrow the world.' Where were we at? In order to avoid defeat and dishonor me and my wife are choosing death. Death. Yes, death. It is our will to be burnt immediately at this very place where I have been serving my people for more than 12 years. 'Oath of Allegiance' Wenck? No news. And the Russians? - Just two blocks away. Into your hands I put my last will. Make sure all of Germany will know it. The time has come. Make sure my incineration will be complete. Not even my ashes must remain. This is the last service you can do for me. 'Be silent.' We want Uncle Adolf!- Be quiet. Uncle Adolf has no time for you. 'Be alert. Never say Jawohl again.'
