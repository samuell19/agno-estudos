STUDIO SWAN (IMJ-E) The time is the middle ages, when gods and demons reigned over a larger dominion than humans, before humans came to rule over the entire world. THE BLOOD OF REBIRTH Hurry, faster! Harder, dammit! Before the sun goes down! Move it! Move it! You deaf? Get moving! Who're you? Where do you think you are? I'm Oguri, the masseur. The Lord called for me. Come in. Damn, it's hot! That's nice. Real nice! You're a good masseur. A really nice touch. Your reputation's well-earned. Feels like the poison's getting sucked from my nads. Caught something from a woman, you see? Look what happened to my poor nads! Like pumpkins, I tell you! Seems you've got some ailments. No way to tell which tramp it was. So, off with all their heads. Chop. I feel much better. I'll live longer, for sure. Stay a while, until the poison's gone. You'll be handsomely rewarded. I appreciate it... but I prefer to stay footloose, doing as I please, day by day. So you're going to abandon me to die? To see the poison reach my head... as I grow demented, writhe around in agony and vomit blood... Is that what you want? Oh no, nothing of the sort. I'd just rather not be in anyone's care. All I want is to rely only on my very own arm. - Just call upon me anytime... - I'm calling upon you, aren't I? So you'll stay. Yes, sir. There's already another Lord ruling over the next world... and I don't like being bossed around. I see. Terute, try his massage. - No, thank you. - Do as I say. Yes, sir. This one hasn't got any disease, so I'm saving her for when my balls heal! Well, here I go... Nice being in good health, huh? Oh, I don't know, sir. Between this world and the next, there probably isn't much difference. Death isn't something to fear. Our time will come in due order. Just wait for my turn, then? God can work something out in return for money, I'm sure. If you stay here, you won't live long. Yes, sir. So get out of here. Yes, sir. If all you say is "yes", you'll never get anywhere. Join us for a meal, at least. Or a drink. Terute... take some of our special sake over to the masseur. Off with the fish heads, ha! Here's to the masseur's footloose, carefree life. Cheers! Cheers. What, you drank the whole thing? You OK? Trying to get away? You're not going anywhere. Couldn't wait for your turn, eh? God sure won't be happy. I'll see you in the next life, for another massage. You had a good life, Oguri. Where am I? Heaven's that way, hell's this way. Have a seat. What'd you do? Drank too much? Well, not exactly... Leave any family behind? My mother, back home. Too bad you're dead. Not much you can do. Say, want to invite your mother? No thanks. Don't worry: You'll see her again. So, which side do you want to go? You can go to heaven if you want. Neither. Why?! You get to go to heaven! It's too early to die. Most folks who come here can't wait to get it over with and go to heaven. I'd like to go back and take care of some unfinished business. Don't bother! It's more trouble than it's worth. Heaven's real easy, you know? The land of the living is hell. Hell, huh? Worse than hell. As long as I've got my hands, I'll always find my way. It's fine with me. Is that what you want? Yes. Want to go back like that? What? In that form. This form? Like that. Like this? - That! - This? That. - This? - That! Oh, the cruelty of God... turning this poor man into a Hungry Ghost. What could He possibly be testing? "He who brings this man to the Spring of Rebirth... "shall be blessed with fortune, love, "long life, bounty, safe delivery, "and all other manner of benefits". You there! If you pull this cart, you can go to heaven. You'll be blessed with children, too. I pray I'll catch lots of bears, find a wife with a nice big rump, have lots of children, have them grow up and take care of me, and I'll live a long and comfortable life. What is it? It's the infamous nose of the tengu demon slayed by the great god Susanoo. A priest who admired Susanoo had long possessed this treasure, but bestowed it to me by his special grace. Does it work? Drink it as tea, and it'll cure anything, as if awakening you from a nightmare. - Terute, go grate this. - Yes, sir. You sure it works? - It works like a charm. - Charm, my ass! - Just try one sip, sir. - Better not be poison. Not to worry; my trade is dependent on earning trust. You drink it first. Oh no, I'm not worthy of accepting such a treasure. Pretty damn suspicious! Just try a sip and you'll be convinced. If it isn't to your liking, I also have a kappa scalp... - Then I'll have that, too. - Just a moment, sir. What else do you have? I have some honey made in heaven... Honey from heaven, huh? That sounds great, too. Hmm... That pain again. Damn, it hurts! Ow, ow! Terute, hurry and bring it! Terute! Bring it, hurry! Terute! Damn, Terute - just you wait! You're not getting away from me! Hurry, faster! Keep working, got it? Hey, lower your heads! Bow to the Lord! C'mon, full speed! Dammit, Terute - wait till I catch you... We're going too slow. A bit shaky there. Where's that tengu nose, anyway? C'mon, pick up the pace! We'll never catch her like this. Now hurry! As fast as you can, dammit! Some water for you. That feels great. Thank you. That bastard! Where'd the merchant go? Everyone's disappearing. Terute, that bastard, my damn tengu nose... Now hurry, morons! - You're the slow one, keep up! - What did you say? - Shut the hell up! How about you trying walking, sir? I would if my balls didn't hurt, asshole! Here: Some honey I stole from heaven. Try some; it'll give you energy. Thank you. A Hungry Ghost, huh? I once died, crossed over, and came back as a Hungry Ghost. This world is hell... an ever-deepening darkness. Everyone's too blind to notice, because all they see are themselves. Selfish, Hungry Ghosts only looking out for themselves. They're pathetic, hopeless creatures. That's why I sell them just a moment of hope. It's just consolation, of course. But a lot of 'em want consolation. They refuse to look at the reality of this world. This place is finished, anyway. Hard to see that unless you've crossed over to the other side, I suppose. There's a Spring of Rebirth at the end of the dragon's land. - Curious? - Please, where is it? I'll tell you if you marry me. But not with that face. First, cross over and come back with a spotless face. Don't be afraid of dying. Close your eyes, jump, and it's over. No, why should I have to die? Don't worry, it's not scary. I'll go with you. - I don't believe you. - Believe me. Can't enjoy life with a mark like that. I'm trying to save you. Go away! I don't want to die... You and I, we'll be reborn again. Don't bother coming back next time. You're pretty just as you are. Thank you. Feeling much better, I see. Terute! I told you, the only place you can escape to is hell! Terute... Harder. - Like this? - Harder. Firm enough, sir? You need to, like, press deep down to the core. Deeeeeep down. No, more. Not bad, but something's missing. Harder, deeper... This hot bath is an elixir of life and rebirth that will turn... even a Hungry Ghost back into human form. I've brought it from its spring, so that Your Majesty may bathe in it. Does it really work? Please try smelling its scent. If it doesn't work, I'll throw you in the pot and turn you into stew. Hmm, what's this smell? Is this an aphrodisiac? Whoa, my tongue's turning numb! Maybe this will cure my balls, too! Damn, that's some kick! Why's this making me numb? What'd you put in it? If you can't cure your illness in this world, cure it in the next! Lord! Where do you think you are? So, which one's the Lord? - This one. - Yeah? - No, this one for sure. - I think it's that one. What do you guys think? - The top one. - Which is it? - The top, probably? - Maybe the bottom. I'd say the top. - I think it's the bottom. - Me, too. - It's one or the other. - It might be the top. It might be the bottom. So which is it?
