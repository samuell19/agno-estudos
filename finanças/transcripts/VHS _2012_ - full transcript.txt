Will you come out here and tell me what happened? What happened just now? Um... Well, somebody knocked on our door and I answered it, and it was a girl... Well, I don't know. She was like, young, but not... Not, like, a girl girl, like, a college-age girl. And... She asked if we could give her a ride... - Tomorrow. - Where? I don't know. It didn't get that far. It was, like, really creepy. That's so weird. I know. It is really weird. My only guess is that she must be just going door to door and asking everybody, but why wouldn't you, like, wait for people to be getting into their cars tomorrow to ask for a ride? It's, like, really... - Maybe it's an emergency. - It didn't seem like an emergency. And also, she's, like, not... She wasn't physically intimidating, but I got instantly... Nervous. There's something really scary about her, even though I wasn't, like, afraid she was gonna hurt me, but she was just, like, weird. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( crickets chirping ) STEPHANIE: She's gone. SAM: What? She's gone. She's not there anymore. That's good, right? Yeah. Do you think we should still call the police, though? ...no. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( clears throat ) Why not? I don't know. I wouldn't really know what to say... - About it. - Oh. And also, I just don't feel like it. Haven't you noticed there's, like, way more hitchhikers here than you've ever seen? Yeah. And also I think this is, like, a part of the country that has drug problems... - Like, meth problems. - Mm-hmm. So I feel like I would rather just let it... - Go. - Okay. And if she's still there in the morning, then maybe we can think about... Doing something about it, but right now... I'm happy to let it drop. That's fine. Do you want to sleep over here with me? Um, no. That's okay. I'm fine. All right. - Good night. - Good night. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( air conditioner hums ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( click ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( snap ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( distant thunder rumbles ) STEPHANIE: I hope it doesn't rain. Does it look like it's gonna rain? Yeah, it looks like it's really gonna rain. RADIO ANNOUNCER: As far as you can see, we've covered... Tents, trucks, trailers, whatever you can think of, for our fifth annual rain dance festival. Mini casinos, fortune tellers, helicopter rides, games, games...! Did you take money out of my wallet? No. Yeah, you did. LAUGHING: No, I didn't. Well, you must have because I had $100 in here... - When would I do that? - And now I have zero dollars in here. Well, I didn't, so maybe you didn't actually have that money. What'd you buy? I didn't buy anything! I have my own money. I don't need to take your money. Are you serious? - Did you...? LAUGHING: What do you think I did? Well, I don't know... I've been with you... - ...because the money's not here! - ...this whole time! I've been with you this whole time. I have no idea what you could possibly be imagining right now. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( clears throat ) Well, it wouldn't be the first time... You decided to treat yourself. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( wind howling ) SAM: How far can you go? I could probably go farther, but I'm too scared. Here, I'm gonna go a little further. Okay. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( wind buffets camera microphone ) STEPHANIE: Are you alive? Did you fall? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( far distant voice chattering ) STEPHANIE: (CHUCKLES) It's just a lady... Out there having a conversation on a cellphone, but it's so quiet that I can hear her even though she's about 50 yards away. CHUCKLES: Oh, weird! I don't think I can get back up. - Do you need help? - Maybe. Can't quite find anything to grab on... AUDIBLY EXERTS: Nice work. - Thank you. - Thanks. SAM: All right, so, babe, I'm thinking... That we could drive home on 40 and spend the night in lake Havasu, and sort of break the trip up so it's not so brutal... Or... My new idea is we could go a little bit out of the way and spend the night in Vegas and still break the trip up, for the most part, but also have, like, one more day of... Fun. I just really badly wanna play craps. - Yeah? - Yeah. I had so much fun playing craps last time, and I haven't done it since. It's, like, the really fun game. Real group participation game. Well, whatever you want to do. You... you get to pick. All right. That is definitely what I want to do. I'm feeling lucky. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( brochure thuds ) Can I turn off the light?

What the fuck was that? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( videocassettes clattering ) What's so special about this tape, anyway? I don't know, maybe it's uh... {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( objects clatter ) Maybe it's a tape of a senator fucking his daughter or something, and we're gonna use it for blackmail. I don't know, as long as they pay us, but I'll tell you this, we're gonna make tapes... - Copies of the tapes. - More money. Can you not put that so close to my face? It's so annoying. Wait a minute... You go to this lake every year? - Yep. - By yourself? WENDY: Um... yeah. But this year, I have you guys, so it's gonna be fun. SAMANTHA: What do you do, just, like, walk around the woods and play with yourself? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( overlapping reactions ) If... if that's what you do, can I play with Samantha? SAMANTHA: Get it out...! WENDY: Guys, let's scare this guy. - Where? - This guy over here. Are you ready? Wait, wait, wait, what is he doing? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( car accelerates, horn honks ) Shit! Oh, shit! Ho ho ho! You almost fuckin' killed that guy! SAMANTHA: He was kind of cute, though. - What? - He was. You are... you seriously want to fuck anything that has two legs with a third tripod in between. I would never fuck you and I would never fuck you. - Oh. - Take it back. Take it back. - I might fuck you one day. - Yeah, what kind of guys are you into? I'd fuck me. Would you, Spider? - Fuck you? - Yeah. Eh, probably. SPIDER: I don't understand. You go to this lake every year. It's just, like a tradition-type thing, or what's the deal? No, it's just fun, and not many people go up there, so we'll have the place to ourselves. SPIDER: Wait, I'll get the door. SAMANTHA: It's good, right? JOEY: I want to see you get it. WENDY: Can I have a piece? SPIDER: I just got a piece for you! Because when you told me about this trip, you said it was just gonna be us girls, but now we're... JOEY: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I need to document this, okay? You told me, Wendy... Wendy, my sweet... That this was just gonna be you and me, and now you've told her that it's gonna be all girls trip. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( indistinct remark ) SPIDER: I'm just glad I'm with some people and not alone. SAMANTHA: I don't want to hear a word about you jerking off. SPIDER: I don't jerk off that much, but... - Not that much? - Come on! SPIDER: Is this it? JOEY: I don't know. Is this it? Oh, okay, yeah. This is... DRAMATICALLY: Ooh, dead end! Let's take the left! Really, Wendy? ...to go, so fucking go, man. I can't catch that thing. Just get it. You have your bowie knife, right? Oh! Get him, get him, get him, get him! SPIDER: Do you got him? - What is that? - It's a barracuda. - A what? - A barracuda. - That's a fish, you idiot! - It's a barracuda... Fly. Oh, seriously? I don't know. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( spider chuckles ) You wanna see me eat it? SPIDER: Yeah! Oh, fuck. You're not really gonna eat it, are you? Oh, my God! Oh, my go...! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughing ) JOEY: ...I mean, I was here to fuckin' boink her. Yeah? What are you...? Wait. I have a question. What are you doing here? Huh? See that, uh, blonde goddess up there? - No, where? - That's what I'm here for. I don't see much of a blonde goddess anywhere. Or, uh... Blonde crack whore, according to you. - Hey, give me the camera. - She is a crack whore. You're not gettin' the camera, bro. - Just gimme it for one second. - Why? - 'Cause I wanna do something. - No. Go fuck yourself. JOEY: Wedgie? WENDY: Joey... Joey... JOEY: Did she wedgie you? SPIDER: No. That's more like it, dick-wise, right above your head. Look. Stop-stop! It's coming right out of your head. It's about the size of your dick, and it's moving! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughing ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( indistinct remark ) ...We're walking around the middle of the fucking woods. Where the fuck are we going? Can you get a shot of this? Yeah, sure. Of what? What, of the wall? Yeah. Just humor me, okay? It's tripping me out. The last time I was here, my friend fell over it. JOEY: All right. Well... Hi, wall. "Hi, Joey." - Good? - You're so... soon as you get back up. SAMANTHA: Why are you carrying around grass? Okay! God! Jeez...! You mother fucker! I didn't do it! Wendy did it! Well, I... You shoulda ninja'd that shit! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( blows ) - Oh, fuck me! - Did I break it?

SAMANTHA: That reminds me of your mom! Oh, that's funny. That's really funny. WENDY: You guys are fucking disgusting. SAMANTHA: Seriously, that's gross! Stop poking it! JOEY: Oh, my God, it's not gonna hurt you. - Oh, look! - Yo, that's filled with nutrients. Just suck on it. Bite into it! What are you doing over there, crazy girl? What's with this camera? Whoa, whoa, look at that! Look, this! - Look at this. - Oh, wow. - Isn't that awesome? - Yo, we could trip all day on that. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughter ) Yeah. SAMANTHA: Oh, yeah. - You like that? Yeah? Dream on. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughter ) Joey... You're all gonna fuckin' die up here. What? - Tell me you got that. - Nice! That one skipped, like, 20 feet. Nice, dude!

SPIDER: Are you guys doing drugs? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( samantha laughs ) What? He fuckin' calls it drugs! Wait, I gotta get this. No, oh, my God, Spider, the look on your face right now... Are you guys doing drugs right now? Seriously. - No, seriously. - Spider, can I tell you something? - Okay. - You're a fucking dweeb. Whatever. I don't... I don't do drugs. How 'bout that? How's that sound? SAMANTHA: Spider, what's wrong? Why do you look so scared? I'm... scared of getting the fear. JOEY: What? SAMANTHA: What? The fear. You never heard of that? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( joey and samantha chortling ) Don't laugh, don't laugh! I'm serious. The fear. You know, when you do too many drugs and then you get, like, all freaked out and crazy? Spider, there's no fucking such thing as the fear. JOEY: Just take a hit, bro. SAMANTHA: Take a fucking hit and chill out! - I'll take a hit if you don't film it. - Promise. JOEY: Okay. SPIDER: Yeah? WENDY: Scout's honor. - Alright. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( indistinct mischievous remark ) - Ahh. - No, no, no. You've got to, like, breathe it in... - Through my nose? - Breathe through your nose.

JOEY: Careful, bro! - I'm sorry! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughs and coughs ) Oh, my God, my throat's on fire. Wendy, what the fuck were you saying before about us all gettin' killed? SPIDER: Wait, what? SAMANTHA: When did she say that? We were over by the mushroom tree. When we were standing over by the tree, she was like, "you're all gonna fuckin' die!" SPIDER: What do you mean, like, here? Like, here-here? JOEY: Here? - Did you guys not hear about this? - ...No. Why the fuck would I come to this lake if I heard about some damn murders out here? Yeah. It was pretty bad. - Wait. - Are you being serious? JOEY: You're fuckin' with us! Get outta here! No, I'm being dead serious. SPIDER: Well, what happened? Um... You know, the weird thing is that I don't remember what he looked like. SAMANTHA: What do you mean, you don't remember? SPIDER: What who looked like? What are you talking about? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughter ) - What? - Fuck you! Fuck you! I told you guys! - What the fuck?! - The fear! You see! SAMANTHA: She gave me the fuckin' fear! - You know what? - Fuck this! Fuck this! - I'm going swimming. - Seriously? - Yep, seriously. - Go for it! WENDY: Will you strip down for me, Joey? - I don't care. - Oh, yeah? SAMANTHA: Are you sure you wanna see that? Like I said earlier, 2-inch cock. SPIDER: (LAUGHING) Mmm... Probably gonna be two inches in a minute! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( spider laughing ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( indistinct remarks ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( spider laughing ) Aah! Oh, fuck! - Oh, it's fuckin' cold, man! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( spider laughing ) Oh, my God! You...! That was crazy! That was fuckin' beautiful. WENDY: I'll join you in a minute. Or not. We'll see. Ohh! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( audibly struggling ) SPIDER: Are you se...? What the hell? Is he...? - I'm fuckin' with you! - Fuck you! Dude, I've got to take a shit. You just scared the shit outta me. Can I come with you? SAMANTHA: Spider, did you bring the fucking camera? SPIDER: No. Yeah. So, what was the deal with Wendy... - And all that killer shit? - I don't know. That fucking story was creeping me out. - She is weird. - I know, right? That's what I'm talking about. The fear, right there. What are you doing behind there? It really stinks. Spider, you wanna see something sickening? - Sure! - It's fucking disgusting. This is my new tryout, Spider, just for you. No one has seen this yet. This shit is red hot. Prepare for awesome. Wait, what? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( whooshing sound ) SAMANTHA: What the fuck? SPIDER: Oh, my God! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( wheezing ) Oh, my God, your eye! Look at your fucking eye! What the fuck? Oh, fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( spider groaning ) WENDY: Hey, Joey. Oh, hey, what's up? Oh, God, it's gettin' fuckin' cold. Where are the other guys at? They left. Wanna fuck? Uh... {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( chuckles ) - They left? - Did you hear what I said? Uh... so they just left their stuff? Joey, please do not tell me you're a virgin. What? Come on, I think we should get back into the lake, fuck each other's brains out, and we could even film it for prosperity. Wow. Uh... Turn that shit off. Don't you wanna fuck me? You were serious earlier, weren't you? About the murders? I remember reading about it now. It was, like, four kids were killed, and the guy... They said the guy was, like, insane. He was beyond insane. He was evil. This lake ran red with their blood, and I came back... To move on. I-I get it. It's some kind of, like, post-traumatic stress therapy or something. No, it's not therapy. I brought you back because I needed bait. Bait? They never caught him, Joey. They never believed me, how... How he was everywhere. How he could be at two places at once. That wall back there... My friend smashed her head open on it. Wendy, this is crazy, okay? I think you need help. Maybe we should just get the others and get the fuck outta here. - They're dead, Joey. - He's back. No. And this time, I'm ready for you. Get that shit outta here. I think you need help. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( gurgling ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( wendy panting ) Unh! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( wendy panting ) Give it to me. Shit. Come on!

You came... Back... For nothing. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( wendy panting ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( heavy thud ) If you're watching this... DISTORTED: Don't come here! WENDY: Joey? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie gasping sounds ) Joey? WENDY: What are you waiting for? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( heavy clank ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( garbled laughter ) WENDY: I beat you, one on one, asshole. Oh, fuck! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( gasping ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( heavy blows land ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( sigh ) Where the fuck did those guys go? Where the fuck did they go? Here you go. I've got a flashlight. Probably fuckin' each other downstairs. Dude, we were just downstairs. They're not downstairs. Where do you think they're at? I don't know. I'll go look for 'em. You look through these fuckin' tapes, okay? No, no, no. Just... look... Just like that, you're gonna leave me in here with this dead fucker? Sorry if your vagina hurts there, sister, but someone's gotta do it. Just get outta the way. Just... fuck it. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( sighs ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( vcr whirrs ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( crickets chirping ) - Hey! - Hi! How was... How was work? It was fine. One of the other girls, uh, called in sick, so I was the only one answering phones all night. Also, my... my arm's been really bothering me. It's like I bruised it or something, but I don't remember how. I think you can see. There's a bump there. Can you see? Mnh-mnh. Well... I know I said I didn't want this, but when you're a doctor, could you just support me, and I'll just... Stay at home? I guess, yeah, if you want that. LAUGHS: That was easy. I mean, do you want me to make it difficult for you? Like, um... I don't know, Emily. I guess you'll have to convince me here. Really? I mean... maybe a little convincing, or... Well, how 'bout now? Maybe a little more? How 'bout now? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( laughs ) Well, now I can show you my apartment. Yay. I mean... I'm gonna see it soon enough. Well, fall break's not soon enough. Um... I know. All right, so this... Like, right here... Uh, this is where I heard the footsteps. Um, back there? Yeah. Right. I mean, could it have been coming from upstairs? No. I mean... I know... I mean, my neighbor always wears heels, so I know what that sounds like. It was weird. It was like, while it was happening, it didn't seem like it was real, but I was awake. And you didn't check? Are you kidding me? No way. I can't believe I was even, like, able to fall back asleep. I mean, it sounds like you were asleep. Okay, well, next time it happens, I'll call you and you can watch me, and maybe I'll be brave enough to open the door. 'Kay. Okay. Emily? Hello? Hey. Hey. Hey. What's? What's going on? There's something at my door. Listen. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct sounds ) Did you hear that? What was that? Shh. Did you see that? Emily, what are you doing? I'm going to open the door with you here. That's stupid. Why? No, no, this is just like before. Hey. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct voice ) See? I told you. My apartment's haunted. It's not haunted. I'm sure there's a reasonable explanation. No, no, this feels really familiar. What do you mean? Well, remember the first time that you got... you got transferred off the base when your father got transferred to fort Leonard wood? - I was, like, 12? - Yeah. Well, that was when things got really bad for me, and I had... you know, I had my big accident and I had to have surgery, and it was the first time we were apart since I was really little. - Mm-hmm. - I mean, now is the first time... We've been apart since high school, and I just... I just... Emily! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( emily screams ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( sighs ) So, you think you saw... Are you sure you saw, like, a little kid? I mean, I-I think I saw something, but it could have been anything, Emily. Like, you know, maybe it was, like... A breeze or something like that. Breeze. Man, of all the times for you not to be recording our chat! I'll record it next time. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( chuckles ) I need to find out if a little kid died here. I'm gonna ask my landlord. Um... I-I don't know if you should do that. I-I don't... I can't imagine he'd be thrilled to have that conversation. Yeah, well, I think he has to tell me. I think it's the law or something. The law? Why are you messing with your arm like that? What's wrong? It's not... It's not getting better. It's like this... Like, a lump under my skin or something. You shouldn't do that. It's not good for you. Just stop touching it, and when I come and see you, - I'll check that, okay? - Okay. You're right. Hey, Emily, what's going on? I'm hearing the noise again. I'm gonna go check it out. Okay. Um... Do you have a weapon? No, should I? Yeah, I think that would be a good idea. Okay, okay, hold on. Okay. Be careful. Yeah. W-w-wait. Look... look towards your living room. Well, I don't... There's a lamp... {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( indistinct remark ) Okay, well, do you have a flashlight? No. Oh, I have... I'll use this. You here? James, are you there? Yeah. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( camera shutter clicks ) I didn't see anything. No. - See anything? - Mnh-mnh. Aah! Emily! Emily! Close your door. Are you okay? I should talk to him. I should have talked... Are you all right? Hey, were you recording that? No. What do you mean? I just got caught up in the moment. James! Next time I call you in the middle of the night, please press record! Okay. All right. I promise. Will you stay up with me tonight? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Thank you. So, I talked to my landlord today. He said no one's ever died in my apartment, ever. That's not exactly something he'd want to advertise, right? Yeah, but he said, like, no kids ever lived here. It's always been student housing. Uh-huh. What's that? What are you doing? Oh, well, I felt that lump move in my arm today. Emily, what the fuck is that? Don't do that! Thought it might be a spider bite. You know, how you hear about...? That's an urban legend. That's not real. It's right under there. Look, look, I'll show you. Stop! Stop that! Don't do that, okay? That's not good for you. This is like your leg, like seven years ago. You still have a scar from that. Emily, what the fuck are you doing? Well, I think if I just... No, no, no, no, no. Put that away. Seriously, Emily, look at me. Emily! Emily, look at me, okay? You need to put that away, all right? Digging around in your arm is not gonna do any more good. You just need to put some alcohol on that or iodine or something like that and... and... and put a bandage on it 'cause otherwise it's just gonna get infected, okay? You know, I'll be there in a week and I'll look at it, but for right now, just leave it alone. You're acting really crazy, all right? Okay, okay. Okay. I mean... Can you go to the bathroom and clean that off? Yeah, yeah. I'll be right back. - Emily? Are you there? - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I gotta... I gotta do some work, so what's going on? I know. This'll only take a minute. - What's up? - He's outside my room. I can hear the little boy's footsteps. That's really scary, Emily, what are you talking about? Well, I just... I need to talk to him, and I need your help. - Um... I mean, I'll help in any way that I can. - Okay. Great, great. So, I'm gonna close my eyes so he doesn't scare me. - What? - I'm gonna close my eyes so I don't freak out... And run back in here, okay? So you're just gonna tell me if he's there and if he's paying attention to me, and then I'll talk to him. I'll find out what he wants... If he wants me to find his body, or... whatever. I just. Uh... I don't want to look at him. He's a ghost. He freaks me out. What?! Um... Okay. All right. Okay, can you do that? Yeah. Okay, okay. So, as soon as... as soon as I open the bedroom door, I'm gonna close my eyes, and then you'll tell me what's there, okay? All right. - Okay, are you ready? - Yeah, yeah. All right, I'm closing my eyes. Hey. Hey. What's there? Uh... I-I don't see anything. It's just your hallway. 'Kay. - Anything in here? - Um... no. No, it's... Go in your living room. Okay, I'm not looking. Listen, I don't see anything, okay? Yeah, you should go back to your room. See him? No, I don't see anything. Maybe... he's done for the night. I'm almost disappointed. - What are you doing? - What? - Emily! - What? Close your eyes. Oh, okay. Is he here? Back to your left. - Okay. - Emily! {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( unearthly sound ) {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( emily groans ) Emily. Emily. JAMES: You're telling me part of this thing is human? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct response ) Well, how many more times are you gonna have to do this to her? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct response ) I don't know if she can survive that. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct response ) I mean, you're telling me. She thinks I'm in Michigan. That's far away, okay? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct response ) And that tracking device in her arm, does that have an expiration date? Good, well, take care of it. We're gonna have to make this look like an accident again. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( eerie, indistinct response ) It's fine. We have people that can take care of it. I'm just gonna have to break some bones. For fuck's sake! Hey, how's it going? Made it back okay? Yeah, yeah. The drive was fine. Are you all right? Uh, yeah. So, your professors aren't mad at you? No. Um... I haven't spoken to my advisor yet, but, uh, I'll explain it to him. It'll be fine. How are... How are you? Okay. Um... I went to see Dr. Aberdeen today, like I told you. Yeah, she came very highly recommended from my colleagues, so... did things go well? She seems really professional. She... she diagnosed me as schizoaffective. It's a mild form of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Okay. I mean, it explains a lot... You know, why I thought I'd seen ghosts, why I don't remember running out into the middle of the street that night. I'm just crazy. Don't say that. Well, anyway, she's got me on some medications... Um, perphenazine, and, uh, I don't... I don't remember. Listen, you're gonna be okay. - You don't know. - I do. You're gonna be fine. You deserve to be with someone normal... You know, someone who doesn't have so many problems. What if we want to have kids someday? You know, um... You're the only person I've ever wanted to be with, Emily, so just... stop acting like I have a choice in the matter, all right? I don't know what I did to deserve to deserve someone... You're so good to me. Get some rest. I love you. Talk to you later. All right. How's it going? {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( distorted audio ) ...Parts. I have, like, a sore spot or something. Did you... did you hurt it on the hike today, or...? Maybe. Maybe I bumped it. I don't know. I keep fiddling with it. Well, don't do that. I'll look at it when I get there. Okay. What are you doing? Changing into my jammies. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. You can keep going. I miss you. There was a lot of couples on the hike today, and I just felt alone, you know? Alone? Yeah? How's that? Sit back a little bit. There. Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. What were you saying? Uh, nothing. {\pos(375,5)}{\a7}( approaching footsteps ) GARY: Zac? Hey, Zac. I can't find any...
