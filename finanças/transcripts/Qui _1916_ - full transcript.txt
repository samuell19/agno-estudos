"Who?" was restored in 2003 by Gaumont and the Cin?math?que fran?aise with the participation of the CNC and the Ministry of Culture, using a safety copy preserved by Henri Langlois. Only the start of intertitles appeared at the beginning of this incomplete work. (Seven shots from one sequence were missing.) The restoration consisted of re-creating the intertitles by filling in incomplete phrases, thanks to a contemporaneous script deposited in the National Library of France, Dept. of Performing Arts.
