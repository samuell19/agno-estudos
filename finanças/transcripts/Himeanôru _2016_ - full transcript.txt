Okamura, stop! Um... It's Okada. Sorry. Okada, your feet. Huh? Oh! The mortar. What the hell... Things are already falling behind. Don't make extra work. Sorry. You think, "Sorry" solves this? What the hell... You're a team leader. Keep an eye on your man. Sorry. What the hell... You say, "Sorry", but I don't see sorry anywhere on your face. Nothing about it says sorry. Sorry. I was born with this face. What the hell... Mr. Ando, I'm really sorry. Forget it. I suck so much. I can't do anything right. Don't take things so seriously. It's not just this. It's other things too. Other things? Mr. Ando. Do you have any hobbies? Not really. Do you have a girlfriend? No, I don't. So, what do you do after work every day? Well, what do you do, Okamura? It's Okada. My life is abysmal. I go home, eat, and then sleep. I putz around all day. No hobbies. No girlfriend. What's worse, I worry about it. Don't you feel like that too? A kind of uneasiness. What are you talking about? Everyone is dissatisfied. In fact, people can't live without dissatisfaction. Isn't ridding themselves of it why they work hard every day? No one is completely satisfied. So, you're not weird. Don't torture yourself. Oh, it's Okamura, right? Sorry. It's Okada. Mr. Ando, that's quite profound. Not really. So, you fight your worries and laze around every day like me? No. I don't putz around like you. But, you said you don't have a hobby. What is it you do every day? Every day, I am in love. Where is this dream girl of yours? - Don't look around. - Huh? There, by the counter. Water? No thanks. That's a lost cause. Lost cause? She's young and pretty... Much higher up the food chain than you. She's everything I live for. You know what happens to those who lose hope? Right. She's the one for you. I'm sorry. Crap, that blondie is here again. Huh? He's always here. Does nothing but give my angel perverted looks. Is that Morita? Friend? Well, maybe. What's he like? I don't know. I've never really talked to him. Talk to him now. I don't know about that. What if he's planning something bad for my angel? Well... Sure. Um... Morita? It's Okada. We went to high school together. Okada? Long time no see. You seem different. Your hair... Is it strange? No, looks good. Mind if I sit? Sure. - You come here often? - No. It's just that my co-worker over there says you're here often. Must have me confused with someone. I see... Why don't we exchange contacts? You sure it was Morita? Maybe it was someone else. No way. Now, we have to start an investigation. An investigation? How can I ask him about that? Not blondie. I mean my angel. Why her? I'm worried that she might be in danger. To prevent that, I need to know more about her belongings. That's stalking. You'll get arrested. You'll be the one doing it. What? Why me? No choice. She knows my face. Give me a break. Come on... Just see if she has a boyfriend or not. What's that got to do with it? Come on... After today's mortar, isn't it the least you can do? That's a cheap shot. Mr. Ando... It's like... I can't do this. Look, I understand your feelings, but... I really can't do it. Mr. Ando, I'm super sorry about this. Excuse me. What are you doing there? Didn't you come here yesterday? Yes. Did the man with the bleached hair send you? No, he didn't. Are you sure? Yeah. I hadn't seen Morita in years. We're not close, or anything. I see. Is he, uh... Yes? No, never mind. Did something happen with Morita? He's kind of like a stalker. What? He started coming to the cafe about a month ago. Since then, a lot of weird things started happening. Weird things? I get a ton of prank calls. And I suspect some of my mail has been stolen. That doesn't necessarily mean Morita is responsible. Just recently I saw him hanging around my place. Twice. Seriously? So, could you convince him to stop? Oh... I wouldn't know what to say. It's impossible? No, I didn't say that. Can I ask you a question? What is it? Do you have a boyfriend? Huh? Why? I was just thinking if you have a boyfriend, it would be effective against Morita. I don't have one. Is that right? I'm Okada Susumu. What's your name? Abe Yuka. Abe. I told you! I won't forgive that bastard. Did you call that blonde dumbass yet? There's no way I can call him. What do I say? "I hear you're a stalker, Morita. You should stop"? - Yes, precisely. - No way! Loser. It's stake-out time as of today. And that includes me? Of course. Oh! I asked her last night. She doesn't have a boyfriend. - Boing! - Boing? Really? Yes. Nice. Um, did Morita come by today? No, he didn't. I called him a bunch of times but couldn't get hold of him. I see. And... here are our numbers. Thank you very much. I'll keep you completely safe around the clock. Contact me anytime. Oh, okay. Two for lunch. Not picking up the phone means that bastard is on to us. Well, I didn't actually call him. I'm relieved he's not here. That'd be scary. Come on, call him. Tell it to him straight. I can't do that. Then not straight out. Just say it roundabout. Fine. Say, there's no smoking here. Mind the rules, okay? I don't smoke. Smoking is prohibited in this whole area. I don't smoke. It's just forbidden. There's no fine. I said I don't smoke. I just saw you smoking. I don't fucking smoke. Sorry to call out of the blue. Whatever. Did you move to Tokyo after graduation? Yeah. I'm working part-time at a cleaning company. What do you do? - Some part-time things. - Like what? Just things. Got it. You know the girl at the cafe from the other day. Who? The young, cute one. Don't know. Really? What about her? I thought maybe you like her. Why? Did she say something? No. Um... Remember my co-worker who was there with me? He seems to kind of like her. He's worried. I think he sees you as some kind of rival or something. Sounds like a fucking creep. Is he nuts? Right? Why are you even friends with him? Well... That guy always struck me as being a douche. He always looks suspicious. Always? Didn't you say it was your first time there? Yeah. - You just said always. - No I didn't. Really? So, Morita, what do you do on your days off? Not much. I don't really do anything either. Recently, I've gotten to feeling anxious about it. I talked to my creepy co-worker about it. He said, even rich people live with anxiety and dissatisfaction. He said no one is completely satisfied. It convinced me into believing everyone is the same. What? No one is the same. Huh? You and I, our lives are over. The have-nots got no hope of escaping from the bottom at this point. The rich live in another world. We occupy the lowest rung. But, even those at the bottom can find happiness, no? Stop daydreaming. Only people who can strive to be happy think like that. We're at the bottom because we lack the talent. I see... So, did you tell it to him straight? I couldn't say anything, let alone say it straight. It was just mentally exhausting. We'll have to keep a lookout then. By the way, I'm thinking of asking her out. What should I say? I don't know. I think it's too soon to do that. If I bide my time, another rival will rear his ugly head. You may be right. Isn't it best to leave it to the natural flow of things? How so? I don't know. Hello? Hey, Wagu? What's up with this month's cut? It's not in yet. Sorry, I've been busy. I'll send the money soon. You do that. Come on. This'll be the last time. Just find a way. I can't. If we're caught we'll not only be fired but possibly arrested. It'll be fine. My dad wouldn't go that far. Just another 500,000 yen. Then, you'll have to tell me why. Why do you have to pay this Morita guy so often? Because... we're friends. That's a lie. This is beyond that. Even though it's your father's company, this is a crime. Please. Talk to me. We can't get married like this. It's been a week now. He's not coming back. Don't give me that exasperated look. I'm sick of the donuts here. I think it's okay now. Please don't feel obligated to come by every day. It's not an obligation. We like the donuts. - Right? - Sure. But... Speaking of likes, I like sake and am well-informed. What? Do you like sake, Yuka? Uh, I can't drink sake. Oh. How about having sake together soon? Huh? Sorry. If sake is out, how about Disneyland? Well... Sake, together with all of us? Yes. You want to drink too, right? Yeah, sure. Mr. Ando, you really did pull it off. To be honest, I'm surprised too. The way you asked was pretty unnatural. I'm sure you know, but don't get between me and Yuka. Same to you. No matter how pretty her friend is, you can't waver. Don't worry, I'm single-minded. But, if it's a friend of hers, I'm sure she's pretty too. That's true! Look! I'm telling you now, I don't have much time today. I forgot to record "Best Hits" on TV. - Ai? - O-Oh, okay... Well, what about you, Yuka? - I'm... - Oh-ho! Not happening. - Say, Yuka. - Hm? Doesn't Okada look like my ex-boyfriend? Huh? Oh, I don't think I met him. No? I guess I never introduced you. In any case, I thought he looked like him the moment I saw him. He moves like him too. Is that a fact... I dumped him right away. When I broke up with him he cried and begged me not to break up with him. He gave me the willies. Okada, looks like the type who cries too. I don't know. So you've dated guys before, Ai? Huh? - What was that? - I didn't mean anything by it. You hear that, Yuka? He's underestimating me. No, I'm not. Now, now. Yuka, what's your dream for the future? To get marri... Our dream is to open a cafe that has great cake. Yeah... What's your dream, Okada? I'm ashamed to say but I don't really have one. Figures. You're just the kind to be dreamless. Like the world you live in is a narrow one. Yeah, maybe it is narrow... Somehow you just strike me as a small person. Ai, don't say things like that! You think so too, right? He's like a tiny, little bean. Look, we just met today. How can you know so much? I just know. I'm a good judge of character. Listen, people only live a few decades. There's no point in being wishy-washy. Ai, cut it out. I'm saying this for his own good, right? Mr. Ando, can I leave now? Don't take her so seriously. It's her way of kidding around. I'm not kidding. Say, Mr. Ando, you like Yuka? Huh? You look at her unnaturally. They're just protecting me from a stalk... I'll tell you straight, Mr. Ando. Ain't never gonna happen. She's in love with someone else. What are you talking about? I can tell. We've been friends since kindergarten. I'm super sensitive about these... Ai! One more word and I'll get mad. I guess I really don't have a shot, huh? To know that, you'd have to ask her. Would it be possible for you to ask her? Again? I'm sorry. But, Mr. Ando... he loves you to death. Is the answer still no? I'm sorry. So, you really are in love with someone else then? Yes. Okay! Well, if by any chance, you were to fall out of love with this person, then would you potentiall... - I'm sorry. - I see. Okay... I understand. I will tell him. I'll be going now. Wait... Yes? The one I'm in love with is... Okada. Oh, me... and him share a name. No. (Me?) For real? For real. Um... W-Why? We've just met. It's like a love-at-first-sight thing, or rather... you're my type. Is that bad? No, it's not bad. What is this? Is this a penalty game? Not at all. Are you sure? Are there cameras? Mr. Ando! It's some kind of mistake. Mistake? What I mean is... Keep it down! - I'm sorry! - Hold on! Mr. Ando, you're too loud! Yuka, calm down! Please calm down! - Shut up! - Sorry! Yuka! Mr. Ando! What the hell? Ando has been absent without notice for a week. Do you know anything? Uh, no. I see. It's getting time to fire him. Mr. Ando! Mr. Ando. Okada, what's up? Come in. Are you here because you're worried about me? Well, yes. Thank you for worrying. - That's what best friends do. - Yeah. But, I'm okay now. I'm over it. Really? After thinking about it... there's no way my best friend Okada would take away the one for me. I mean, she's the one for me. Right. If you did something cruel like that, I'd have no choice but to... chop you up with a chainsaw and flush you down the toilet. You don't want to be chopped up, right? Of course not. I was about to call and turn her down. Good. Okay. I understand the situation. I'm sorry. It's just that getting chopped up would be rather inconvenient. And? What do you think? I want to know what you think of me. You mean, how I feel about you? Yes. Well, in all honesty, I think I like you. Really? Is it at a high enough level where you could date me? No... I mean... It's at the level where I would absolutely love to date you. But, you feel bad for Mr. Ando and find you can't date me, right? Yes. That's unfortunate. It's so unfortunate it's killing me. Wait, does that mean it wouldn't be a problem so long as we're not discovered? Well, yeah. I guess so. It'll be fine. If we date in secret, he won't find out. You think so? As long as we keep our mouths shut, it'll be no problem. Yes, perhaps. Maybe you're right. Yes. Then... would you be my boyfriend? Yes. What are you doing? You startled me. That Morita guy again? No, not him. Then, what is it? Well, you know... It's him, right? You promised that the last time was it. I said that we'd split up if you broke your promise. Come on, don't say we'll break up. Then talk to me. Not coming to me for advice is what hurts the most. Do you think I'm of no help to you? All right. I'll tell you. Morita and I were always bullied in high school. This guy Kawashima did a lot of things to us. Every day was a living hell. The only thought on my mind was... how I could die. I told my parents I wanted to quit school, but they wouldn't hear of it. So, I just killed my feelings. I tried to put up with it. Then... a week before graduation... Morita suddenly showed up at my house and said... "I captured Kawashima. Let's kill him together." You're late, Wagu. Get yer ass over here. Okay. It's really funny. If you choke him, he passes out again and again. His eyes roll around and he twitches like a fish. This isn't good. Go ahead and smack him one. I don't want to. Say what? Didn't we swear to kill this guy one day? B-But... If we let him go, we'll be the ones killed. All the things he's done to you... Remember them and do it. So, I hit him. His face, his stomach... His entire body, over and over. Each time I hit him, a bad memory came out. I couldn't stop my hands. Then in the end, Morita strangled him. Kawashima died. You killed him? I did. Buried the body. After that, Morita changed. He became arrogant and even acted violently towards his parents. In time, he started squeezing money from me. The guy's insane. You're lucky. The boss was so pissed, he was ready to fire you in one more day. I'm sorry to have worried you. I'm okay now. I understand now. Understand what? That Yuka's the only one for me. I'm thinking I should try again. Really? Yeah. She is probably feeling lonely after you turned her down. So I might have a chance now. Huh? You did dump her, right? Sure... Then now's the time for me to strike. Let nobody tell you that something is absolutely impossible. I believe this. For real... - Come on, let's go. - Sorry, I can't. Let's go out to eat. You're here by yourself, aren't you? What's the problem? Come on. Okada! Oh... Bye. That shrimp? W-What? Am I doing it wrong? No. Eating together like this feels like we're actually going out together. Yeah. We are dating, right? Yeah, we are. Hot! That was hot. I want to do lots of things with you. Things? Yeah, lots of things. Lots of things, huh? When you say lots of things, do you mean... I mean, what's the size of the framework? Like, how broad is it? Framework? I mean, going to karaoke or an amusement park. Oh, okay. I got it. Yeah, I want us to do lots of things. Oh, by any chance were you imagining something erotic? No. Not at all. Nothing inappropriate like that. That's out of the framework. Oh. For me those things are within the framework. FAMILY PLAN CONDOMS Which one is good? The red one. I'll get the red one. I got 'em. Thank you. Hold on. Sorry. Isn't that the top? Right. By any chance, is this your first time doing this? No, it's not that. Sorry, it is my first time. Hey, Wagu. What's wrong? I sent you the money. No, I need you to come over. What, now? Why this late? There's just someone I want to kill so I need your help. What?! What do you mean? Remember Okada from high school? I'm going to go kill him now and bury him in the mountain. H-Hold on a second. That's impossible. - About Kawashima... - Oh... I don't care if I get arrested, but you'll be in hot water. If you don't help, there's no telling what I'll do. Come on. Give me a break. Sorry. I wasn't very good, was I? Don't say that. Hey. Look. It might creep you out if I ask this. What? Before me... how many guys did you do it with? You don't need to know that. I know that. I know, but... I'm an adult and I think I'm an understanding man. I just want to know more about you. Well then, let's see... Around ten, or so? Ten... or so? See? Knowing makes you upset. No, I'm cool. It's totally fine. How about this? How old were you the first time? Uh... fifteen? Fifteen. Oh, fourteen. Fourteen... Sorry, I shouldn't have told you. No. You're really turning yourself in? I'm sorry, Kumiko. I can't take it anymore. Find someone better. Well... I should go. Let's kill him. Huh? Let's kill Morita. It's not your fault. It's all his fault. But, I actually helped kill Kawashima. I want to be with you forever. I can't let you do this. Are you serious? I'm serious. Let's kill him together. Let's take back our life. I'm sorry. I know it's a shock. Please don't be mad. I'm not mad. From now on... we'll do lots of things. You're late. Hurry when I call. Kumiko! The rope. Hurry! Now! Hurry! What are you doing? Hurry up! Hey, that really hurt, Wagu. You missed. Before dawn today, a fire broke out at an apartment in Tokyo's Ota Ward. Two bodies were found in the first-floor room, and three in the one above that. In total, five bodies have been discovered. The bodies on the first floor remain unidentified. Police and fire officials are investigating the cause... There's a real crazy guy here. What? He spoke to me. Talk about scary! Make a sound and you're dead. Don't move. Someone hit the jackpot today. Looks like you racked in 150,000 yen. Hand it over. Hand it over? That's straight-forward. Too rude. Oh wow! A razor! You watch too much TV, asshole. That shit won't work. Try it. Psych and kick! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Say... I went shopping... and got this. What's that? No way. Just a little. No way. I'm not sure how I feel about those kind of fantasies. Haven't you used one before? I'm not saying I haven't. You mean, like by yourself? No! With an ex-boyfriend. Oh, sorry. It's cool. I'm sorry. That was before you met me. I don't care. You do care. I said I don't. Then face me. Does it matter which way I face? Okay... Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I really am small. Hm? The other day. Your friend said I seemed small. I really am. That's not true. Don't hate me. You're in booth A-31. Which course do you want? The night one. It'll be 1,530 yen in advance. Uh, give me the 3-hour instead. Then, it's 910 yen. Hey, Morita! Stand straight! Don't move. I said don't move! Here, here, give me. You missed. Morita, stand still. Stand still or I'll kill you. There you go. Come on and eat this shit. Here! Hey! Quit fighting so hard. Now eat it. Come on. Holy shit! He actually ate it. You too. Get over here. Eat it. Eat it now! What does shit taste like? Tell me, fucktard! Come on, tell me! Good morning. Morning. A weird guy was in front of your apartment last night. Is everything okay? What? He just kept on kicking at your door. I think you should call the police. Okay. Look, I have a favor to ask. Again? Yeah... It's embarrassing to do at this age. But I'm thinking of confessing my love for the first time. To Yuka? Of course. The thing is... I know what you want to say. She'll turn me down. She surely will. Still... no matter how often she turns me down, I won't give up. I'll express my feelings over and over. I see... You see, love and faith... are not bound by time. Love will find a way. The first step is to ask her out to an amusement park. Actually! What? It's extremely hard to say this, but... You don't mean... she has a boyfriend? Yes. Seriously? Who could it be? To be honest... It's me. When? Around the time you bought the chainsaw. You mean... you've kissed? Kind of. Don't tell me, you've squeezed her boobs... and inserted and extracted your penis in her. More or less. Okay. I see. - Fuck you, shithead! - Whoa, now. - You've been lying to me! - No! - Laughing at me behind my back! - No, never! Fuck you. You're not my fucking friend anymore! Mr. Ando! Wait, Mr. Ando! Don't touch me! Calm down, Mr. Ando. - Cool it. - You're terminated! Really... You think he'll be okay? I'll take care of him. More importantly, are you okay? I think you should tell the police. Well... I've talked to them before, but they can't do anything unless there's actual harm or evidence. No. Once actual harm is done, it's too late. Yeah. Come to my place for now. You shouldn't go back to your apartment. You're right. I'm home. Did you make curry? Huh? Who are you? What the hell are you thinking? Are you nuts? There are no company rules about hairstyles, right? Even so, I could never allow you to work like that. Mr. Ando, what happened to your head? This? This is to remind myself to never fall in love again. Are you really okay in the head? Oh yeah. We are friends no more, so would you mind not talking to me? Come on... Boss, could you terminate my partnership with Okada? Your partnership is not the issue here. Don't show up until you've fixed that head, okay? Hello? Hello? Sorry to bother you. Mr. Inoue, you have a minute? I rang the bell a couple of times. Sorry, but can you open the front door? Thank you. Someone reported that they can't get in touch with the Inoues. Who might you be? I'm his brother. I see. Where's Mr. Inoue? He's sick and in the hospital. Really? Which hospital? Nearby. Nearby, you say? Nearby. Do you know the name of the hospital? I see. May I enter? Sure. Excuse me. I was wondering. What's up with the front yard? Huh? It looks like some digging is going on. I guess so. Has it been there long? I guess so. Recently, there was a case where a wife buried her dead husband. Just in case, do you mind if we dig it up later? Be my guest. Someone like you should die right now. Die! You're a worthless creep. Die already, you piece of shit. I said die! Cool down. Yeah, we should kill them all. Fucking kill them! You're the one to die! Calm down. I want to eat meat. I said die! Fucking trash them! Kill! Where's the bitch named Abe who works here? Oh... if you mean Yuka, she quit yesterday. Hey, you. Should I call the police? That was fucking loud! Thought I aimed at the head. Whoa, whoa. Don't move an inch. That whore really moved, huh? I told you, didn't I? Hey. Hey. Where did she move to? I told you, I don't know. You do, right? I really... I really don't know. Hello. Hello. What happened? See, there is a pile of newspapers. I'm pretty sure it's Morita. You mean Morita Shoichi? Yes, he and I went to the same high school. Then, you know Wagusa Kosuke? Yes. What about him? He and his fiancee... They were found burnt to death in Morita Shoichi's apartment. So... Did Morita do that too? We can't say for sure yet. Boss. What? Why is Okada off? Don't know. See you. Take care. Oh... Hey, aren't you the guy who's stalking Yuka? What are you doing here? Where's Okada? He's off today. Hey, stop right there. Don't tell me you're still stalking her. Hey. Wait. Where are you going? Hey. Stop. Where does that Okada guy live? You know his address? Why? I'm thinking of killing him. What are you sputtering on about? I knew you were off your rocker. Yes, I am. A model gun. I can tell at a glance. He'll be okay. There's no way Mr. Ando will die. This is all my fault. What can I do? It's not your fault. It is my fault. Morita came to kill me. It's because I'm seeing you. It's not your fault. I am to blame too. You are? Actually, right after I entered high school... I became friends with Morita. We liked the same kind of games. But, then... this guy Kawashima started bullying Morita. I began to distance myself from Morita. After that, he stopped coming to school. Then, this Kawashima guy... got bored of having no one to tease. He ordered me to bring him Morita. I told him that Kawashima wanted to apologize for what he'd done. I lied. Then, I brought Morita to school. Come on, get it up. Your dick isn't hard at all! Hurry. Fuck, everyone is watching! What a dunce! A fucking riot, no? Sure is. Gross! Rub that shit harder! Do it right! Hurry it up! It's totally limp! I laughed along with Kawashima. I watched on with contempt. But, that's... I still can't forget those eyes of his. Those hopeless eyes. Those dead eyes. They didn't look human. Mr. Ando. Hi, Okada. Mr. Ando. Thank goodness. Mr. Ando. What's wrong? Don't cry like that. Sorry. Mr. Ando. I'm sorry. You went through this because of us. No. This is something I did to myself. I am sorry. Huh? I terminated our friendship. Don't even... We are... best friends, right? Of course. Thank you. Mom, what's up? Susumu? I saw the news. That murderer is your classmate? Yeah. It's the talk of the whole neighborhood. I heard there's going to be an explanatory meeting. Explanatory meeting? Yes, this evening I got a call from your classmate, Yamamoto. There was no Yamamoto in my class. Maybe I heard it wrong? He wants to send you documents about the meeting, so I gave him your address. Really? I'll call you back. Stop! Your call has been forwarded to the voice mail service center. Hello. Metropolitan Police Department. State the nature of your emergency. Listen. Noisy bitch. I won't mind fucking you after I kill you. Let's stop now, Morita. I'll stop after I kill you two. If you commit further crimes... Huh? I'll be sentenced to death anyway. You're mad about that day, right? I truly regret all of it! That day? When you were forced to masturbate in front of the class. I laughed along with everyone. You're upset, right? Oh, that? Were you there? You don't remember. I don't remember. Whatever. Stop! Get back! Any closer and he's dead. Halt! Stay away. I see you again, he's dead! Out! Get out! Stop! Morita, let's call it quits. Shut up! Morita. You weren't the kind of guy who would do something like this. Why? Why are you doing this? The real you... is kind and... I said shut up! Okada? I didn't know you were here. What? Oh yeah, I have to return the video game you lent me. What? Where did that game go? Morita? Mom! Can you bring us some drinks? Okada... Visit me anytime you like. Okay. So, your name is Okada, right? Yeah. Okada, what junior high did you go to? Uh, West Third Junior High. Oh, okay. I'm Morita, from Konuma Junior High. Oh, Konuma? Yeah. Have you talked to anyone yet? No, you're the first one. Really? Yeah. Shoot! You're catching up to me. Mom! Can you bring us some drinks? Subtitle translation by Norman England, Kenichiro Shimbo
