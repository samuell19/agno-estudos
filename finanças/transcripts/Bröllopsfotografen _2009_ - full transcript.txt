Hi, bro! Did you hear about the ultrasound? Yeah, Mom said it had a vagina. That's great. Here, take a picture of my back. - Bobby, pull the shirt up. Wow, it turned out really gorgeous. It's alright. I was thinking of doing a spider tattoo. A black widow climbing towards the ear. Real awesome. It'll be sort of a death symbol. That depends on if we can afford it. Our wedding is going to cost a bit. Fuck that. You have to live your life, don't you? -Can I watch a movie with you? -No, it's cuddle night. -Bobby was gone on cuddle Friday. -I got kind of drunk. I'll come with you, I need the walk. Wait, it's that guy! Jonny Björk, that guy from TV. He's hilarious. Let's get tickets. I can't see things like that. I bet it goes on for two hours- -and I need to smoke, you know. Forget this. There's no point in doing this. Where is everybody? ls there some other event in this village? Anything else going on? Are you talking to me, or is this part of the show? -I'm asking you. -I see. New DVDs come in on Wednesdays. Maybe that's why there are few people here. -What's that smell here? -The sulfate factory. I guess I go 400 kilometers back to Stockholm. Can't you do the beginning of the show? It's not a show, it's a play. Forget it. -Can I take a picture, then? -Sure. Just one more. THE WEDDING PHOTOGRAPHER Come on, cut that out and focus on your work instead. -We don't want accidents. -We're waiting for a delivery. -Can't I shoot in the meantime? -No, it doesn't look good. People say you get special treatment for being my son. We don't want that. Move away from your parents already. You'll be 29. Why? I'm not ashamed. I have my own entrance, my own money. -My own fridge. -Thrilling. Robin, I know what we'll get them for a wedding present. -A baby carriage. -I have a better idea. Good lord. Bobby and Malin are going to go nuts. That's great. -Everyone here can chip in. -What a swell idea. -Ove, listen to this... -Wait, wait. This is Ove. Yes? Yes. I see. Alright, I'm coming up. -Robin! It's starting! -I'll be right there. You've reached 100,000 crowns. Here's your tenth question. For 100,000 crowns, here is the question. The Eiffel Tower in Paris was built for the World Fair... -March 31 st 1889! -Damn. I can't do a thing next week. There are good shows every evening. -Quiet. -He looks so dour. That's just pathetic. Frighteningly easy. The Eiffel Tower was inaugurated... -...in 1 889. -You should be on this show. I don't have a need to show off. -You know everything. -I like being in the background. As they say, working without being seen. The steel for The Eiffel Tower came from here in Värmland. And it's held up for 1 20 years. There's a one bedroom available in the new HSB houses. I'm thinking of moving down there. -You thought about World War One. -It went through my head. What's the matter, Dad? Did I say something stupid? This thing about moving to HSB... I don't know. -It's only 1 50 meters away. -Yes, I know, but... This is not the right time to start increasing your expenses. What? Are they firing people? They're closing down. That's the way it looks. -How much does it look that way? -A lot. Those pigs in Stockholm... Keep quiet about this. We don't want to start a panic. Don't tell Bobby and Malin. That'll ruin their wedding. And I need to look calm. After all, people look up to me in the village. -So, are we going to have to move? -Dear Robin... Are you insane? Didn't you learn anything in school? The government will bring in something new or give welfare. That's nothing to be ashamed of. We can't help it if the jobs disappear. We haven't done a thing. We're victims. Get in closer. Sit down. I'll just snap one. Come on, sis. -Awesome! -Perfect. -That loader belongs to the factory. -I know. -I'm responsible if anything happens. -So? They're closing down. -Not a word about that tonight. -Right. -I thought I was going to miscarry! -Never mind that. It's fine. Come on, Bobby and Malin's wedding picture! -Welcome, Jonny. How are things? -How can you live in this stench? Can't you smell it constantly? It's the factory, and they're closing down anyway. Don't mention that. I'll take you in through the kitchen. You're supposed to be a surprise. Ove is making a speech! Ove is making a speech! Shut it! Us Värmlanders can be found all over the world. Did you know that Julia Roberts, from "Pretty Woman"- -is descended from here? Buzz Aldrin, that guy on the moon, he has Värmlander blood. -Zarah Leander. -And Kenny Bräck. And soon, there will be another Värmlander born- -to be proud of. This will be a racially pure värmlander. I guarantee that. Oh, beautiful Värmland You lovely land You crown among the Swedish lands Yes, if I ever end up in the holiest of lands Hi, Jonny. Figured out what you're doing? I brought some poems by Jan Øyvind Salberg Gagnef Brøjs, a Dane. Can't you just tell dirty jokes, like you used to do on TV? -Dirty jokes? Isn't this a wedding? -Well, yeah... But the groom Bobby loves that kind of thing. I don't really have the same taste. I live uptown. -Uptown? -That's right. Dad's a foreman, so we ended up living on that nicer street. -With a sea view and stuff. -I see. Oh my. Did you get my pics? Being a photographer is my dream. -So wake up and become one. -It's not that easy. You need a studio and a better camera than this. I guess you'll have to take a loan. -I don't think there's a market here. -So move to where there is a market. I like it here, it's really beautiful. Shut it! - Malin, you're not just fine. You're smart too. Probably the most intelligent girl I've ever met. And I've met a few. Which is why I was thinking... A toast! Sis, Bobby... I think we've all chipped in for this present. It's an almost unreal present, to be honest. A memory to cherish for the rest of your married lives. Hang on to your hats. - Welcome, Jonny Björk! -So there's a wedding here? -Yep. Before Ingvar Oldsberg's latest marriage- -he wanted to look nice and went to the hairdresser. The hairdresser was embarrassed- -and asked what Mr Oldsberg wanted done to his three hairs. -Wait, I'm not quite done. -So, why aren't you on TV anymore? We could make a petition and send it to the network. I don't want to do TV, it's that simple. Not everyone does. I don't. Say something funny now. Regarding this stench that you all live with around the clock... According to Robin, if you've grown up with it, you don't think about it. Maybe you want an outsider like me to describe it to you. That smell means work, you know. I guess there are positive aspects to the stench. Like not having to blame the dog if you have bowel problems. But you may not have to blame the dog once they close the factory. Dad! Are they closing the factory? Yes. -But you're on child leave. -What about after that? Good, that's good. Excuse me, Jonny, but... -But I want my fee. -They want their money back. It's 1 0,000 whether they get the jokes or not. It's not my problem if they lack a sense of humor. Okay. I can come to Stockholm and take pictures to repay you. -I'm thinking of starting a business. -What kind of fool talk is that? People get married all the time, and I could handle the entire thing. Photographs, music, food... Don't take any loans, Robin. The banks are treacherous. But not to me, because they wouldn't dare. -You and Mom could co-sign the loan. -I guess so. What if it doesn't work out. How's that going to make you feel? -Is that a risk you want to take? -So what are my alternatives? I mean, they're closing the factory. I have to make a living. Yes, and this is how it works: You fill your freezer with as much game as you can- -do as much work under the table as you can and wait for better days. We're not going to let Stockholm get their way. They can't make us move. No, right. -What did that thing cost? -I didn't know you were home. -It was 80. -80,000? Good lord. -98,000 with the lens. -98,000? So you got a loan? What about co-signers? It was a telephone loan, they don't require co-signers. I'm taking out an ad so the work will start pouring in. MOLKOM FACTORY SHUTS DOWN Robin, you should photograph happy people, not exploit their misery. Hey, bro. Has anyone called about the ad? It's been a week. Sell that camera and get your feet back on the ground. I took out another ad. It'll be fine. ls that the dream? Photographing weddings- -when you can't find a bride for yourself? Fine. Don't come whining to us when the repo man comes. -I think your dad's right. -It doesn't concern you. Of course it does. He'll be my kid's granddad. Don't mess with granddad. And now, for 100,000 crowns... Hi, Robin. Jonny Björk here. About that debt, I need some photographs taken. Get in touch. -Where are you going? -To do a shoot. -In Stockholm. -Stockholm? I have to. I need to pay the debt to Jonny Björk. Wait just a moment. Not with my car. Not in that traffic. Can't he just take the car over the weekend? You get things when you deserve them. -I think you should let him take it. -He has to learn to earn his keep. By doing work under the table, you mean? Damn. Excuse me. Perfect. Really nice. Can I just snap one? -Who are you? -Hi. I'm Robin, wedding photographer. Taking some cool pictures of the wedding. -Who invited you? -Jonny Björk. He'll be giving the bride and groom the pictures. -We wear tuxes here. -Like I can't tell. You're in the way here, and we don't need pictures from in church. Hello! I'll wait right here and do the portrait after church. Hip hip! Hip hip! Nice try. Excuse me. Wait...damn it. Wait! I'm doing the portrait first. I found just the spot for it. -We've already had portraits taken. -We did it yesterday. -I'll just join you in the car, then. -Listen, you know what? Bye! Excuse me, but why are you at our wedding? I'm a wedding photographer. I'm Robin from Molkom. I had quite a way to go. -When did you guys meet? -Three summers ago. Yes, it was the best summer of my life. Slow down. You've embarrassed me enough. -To the happy couple! Hip hip! -Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray. A toast! Shouldn't it be four hoorays? -Not here. -How silly. Welcome, everyone! -You left this. -Thank you. -So, you're a photographer too? -Yes. I was hired by Jonny Björk, the guy from TV. -Did you get any good pics in church? -Yes, but with slow shutter speeds. That faggot wouldn't even let me in. You'd never catch me dressing up in 1 9th century clothes. So, who hired you? Wow, this is one amazing party hall. Isn't it? Robin, it's not a party hall, it's a home. The little piece of plastic that closes the bread bag - it paid for this. Classe's family are entrepreneurs. And put your shoes on, we're not savages. Hi, Dad. Have you checked the answering machine? -If anyone called for the ad. -Where are you? At a wedding in Djursholm. At Tax Evasion Lane 4. It's like in a Bond movie when they're at the villain's house. -Right. -Nope... There's champagne and garlic food being carried by models. Stop that. You can talk to your mother. They live in a damned castle. -With columns and everything. -Columns? Hello? What kind of wedding is it? -Who are the people there? -Multi-millionaires. So, my friends. No more time for small talk. The dining room is ready! -Robin... -Hi, Jonny. I'm starving. -Can you get me a seat? -You're done here. -Okay. How do I get back to the car? -You're on your own. -I'll get in touch. Thank you. -You two are there, and mom there. -We can get you a seat. -No, I gotta go. -What, did you get a seat? -Yes. So why didn't I get a seat? I've been working too. The first hypocrite of the evening... Sorry, I meant to say speaker. He requires no introduction. The Don Corleone of the packaging industry. The Last Tycoon. - Go ahead, Classe. I say, Jonny Boy. Are you really going sailing with us this year? Elsa, you've had many infatuations. Your first great loves were mom and dad. But that passed. And then it was Pontus in Torekov. Or was it his vespa you were in love with? The next infatuation was Justin Timberlake. Yes, good lord. It cost me a pretty penny- -when you traveled all over the US to see every one of his concerts. We even had to delay our kitchen refit that year. Tough on the faggot to have such a pissy daughter. Astrid, don't do what your sister did. Fall for a Swedish rock star instead, to save daddy's wallet. Why didn't you say anything? That's mean. Anyway, Filip. We've spent many good summers together- -and we'll see many more. I'll let you sail with us. I'll teach you how to pilot a proper 54 foot boat around Tjörn Island. VÄRMLAND IN MY HEART Have you checked the answering machine for work? No, not on the cell phone either. Damn. I'm coming home, right after l deliver the photos to the customer. Hi, here are the photos. -Aren't you going to look at them? -What day...what time is it? -Eleven AM. -Damn, the christening. Wait, you still owe me, and l haven't bought a christening present. -I can lend you a suit. -But I have to go home. What are you going home to? Hi there. Up and at 'em again. -Are these the folks from yesterday? -So? It's free food and booze. -I can get you in for lunch. -I'm going home. -I don't like their attitude. -It'll be fine. Just make an effort. -I can't be anyone but myself. -Yes, sadly. I brought one of Sweden's best photographers- -to shoot the christening as a present for little Ludvig. I see you've ordered great weather again today. I brought Robin. He took pictures at the wedding. They were going to be my wedding present. I'll take that later. I can't be lugging things around now. -So how are things? -I have to sail the boat up. I see. Do you need any assistance? Assistance? Aren't you touring with folksy comedies on the weekends? -These pictures are fantastic. -Do you think so? -Better than the wedding portrait. -The photographer is in high demand. Especially in my business. Everyone wants him. Come on, smile. What do you look like when you're happy? Come, I'll show you something. I used to live in that white house. Houses here cost upward of 1 0-20 million. So why did you move? I got tired of lawns, furnaces and stuff. Alright, lunch is served. -You sit there. -Are you here? You've seen me all along. Please sit down. -Astrid. -Robin. You can pour a bit more. I saw your wedding pictures. They were great. Do you have a portfolio? -Portfolio? -A binder with your photographs. That you use to sell yourself. The bill for the whiskey tasting came to my house. You and Jonny can stop talking for a bit. -Is this for real? -Yeah. -That's how they do it...sometimes. -Do you know them? -No, no. It was just a job. -You could exhibit these. Who buys wedding pictures of unknown people? -You have an original style. -I do? -Am I good enough for here? -Give it a shot. -What would people pay? -We're leaving. -Shouldn't we eat first? -No, we're going. We're done here. Classe's old lady is good looking but she can be so stupid. A working class battle axe, but you can't say that. But it's not easy to hide with that dialect of hers. Thanks for the ride. Drive carefully. Wait, Robin. You've got my suit. Just send it to the dry cleaner at home and send it with the photos. You have a dry cleaner there, right? Don't let it hang outside and get that stink on it. Hi, do you know where I can rent an apartment? In this town you don't rent, you buy. If you have a million- -you can get 1 5 square meters in some old bike shed, or something. I was just wondering. -I'll be going, bye. -Wait. Are you just going now? What a great generation. As soon as things don't go your way, you leave. If your girl dumps you, you call a psychiatrist- -and two days of work burns you out. Your generation wants it all free. Sneak into the subway for free and download stuff online. You make demands on everyone else but want it all for free. Who the hell is paying for my retirement? I haven't done anything. I haven't even been in the subway. I'm sorry to fly off the handle. It wasn't aimed at you personally. I have a room you can borrow. I haven't had time to clean it up. Well, the cleaning lady hasn't. She has too many other things to clean. Should you take those with alcohol? Of course. Otherwise they have no effect. Damn... Tomorrow I'm going to Grums to play "Doktor Glas". -Isn't that what you want to do? -No, I want to be on a real stage. I don't want to ride around like some buffoon... But never mind that, I've got great things brewing. Many great things. I reject nine out of ten offers. These are my nine headlines. You get hounded everywhere. You're never left alone. I try to keep them at arm's length. You have to have some integrity to survive in this field. One more makes ten. Once you're in the ten club, you're immortal. 5,000 a month, and that's being nice. I can't go lower. Alright, 3,000. But then you can't use the tanning bed, because it uses so much juice. I'll get you a better bed than that. Then we usually... You always pay three months' deposit in Stockholm. 9,000. -The styling is better than the photos. -I see. This is more event photography. - Thanks. Did you check with the papers? They always need paparazzi. Yeah, I checked, but they were full up. This is really well done. But you don't feel like the kind of photographer we're looking for. I can't go home before I've fixed the dent in the car. -I have to solve that. -I can give you a tip. If you ignore the problem for long enough it tends to go away. That's something you learn working in TV. I have to go. Can you take this? We'll work it out later. -What? -I'm in a hurry. We'll settle it later. It's just a few beers. I have to meet a movie producer. Talk to you later. Hello? Hi, Mom! What are you up to? I'm sitting with a cup of coffee, trying to accept things. We've paid your first loan payment. 6,000, 18% interest. -When will we see that money? -I'll deposit it as soon as I can. -I hope so. -Bye. -I'll give you 30,000 cash. -Absolutely never under 40,000. 40,000 or more. It's just a door. Never mind, then. Alright, then! -Hi, can I see your portfolio? -Hello. I think I've moved here. So, can I come in and see the portfolio? Sure. -Are you going to a party? -No, I just got home from work. -Is that how you dress for work? -Evidently. Here's a fashion shoot Jonas let me do on my own. -Jonas? -Jonas Molin, I'm his assistant. These pictures are great, totally. Man, you're really talented. He should be your assistant. I'm not so sure. What's this? A curtain? -That's my sister's wedding. -Right, I see that now. Want to start a business? We could rent a studio and just go. We could do great together. Screw that Jonas guy. -Right. -Or not. -Is Stureplan far from here? -No. -I want to see it. -I don't know. Come on, I want to see it. -And where is Stureplan itself? -Right here. This? I thought it'd be a bit more...impressive. Big. Neon signs, and that kind of thing. -I think we could work well together. -I think we're too different. Different? You're the one that's different, if anything. -Can you fix an exhibition? -Mom's having one. She's an artist. Without my pictures. She says photography isn't art. Can't you get your own exhibition? -I can't afford it. -You're hilarious. You have money. -I have to make do like everyone. -Sure. Your dad's smart. That plastic thing for closing bread bags is genius. My family alone has probably bought 1 0,000 loaves through the years. It was my grandfather's idea. Dad just inherited it. How rich is he? He could finance us. If you want to date my dad, why don't you just call him? Boy, did she get angry. -Robin. -Hi, Dad here. You're an uncle. -Malin gave birth last night. -That's great. -Tell her hi from me. ls she alright? -Yes. And I need the car back. We have to sell it, for the mortgage and your loan. Just give me a week, and I'll get you the car. I'm just starting my business. Don't expect too much and get disappointed. If you can't drive the car here, I'll send Bobby. Hello? -Hi. -Lead role, The City Theatre! -Wow, that's great. -Yes. -What's the show? -It's not a show, Robin. I'm no dancer. It's a play. It's called "The Soul". Some actor got sick. Maybe he got a touch of hubris, or something. ls it a comedy? Does "The Soul" sound like a comedy to you? I'm done with comedies now. Humor is a perishable item. Misery lasts much longer. -What have you been up to? -I've been to see Astrid. I was surprised to hear that she had no money. Don't talk money all the time. The upper classes never do. -Why not? -Here, read this. "Good Etiquette". People who have read it say that it's great. I don't need to read it, because I already have it in me. They're good looking, upper class girls. Generations of breeding. Damn, I don't have time to tan now. What do you mean? Breeding? All rich guys want good looking old ladies, right? After a few generations they all look the same. Long, thin, blonde and thin. And then they just get better looking. It's like where you live, except the other way around. I don't have time for a shower either. Classe and Cecilia have a party tonight. -Again? -Everyone wants to go. But Cecilia thins the herd. She guards Classe's money like it was her own. She's a bit worried about Classe's various business plans. -Like what? -All sorts of projects. I have good business ideas. Can you arrange a meeting with Classe? Classe? You call him Claes, I call him Classe. Have you had time to get money? You still owe me for the rent. I haven't fixed my ATM card and need to buy a present. I hope you're not using me. I don't like parasitic life styles. -9,000. -Hot damn. Great. -Can I come along to the dinner? -Absolutely not. I'll run out to buy a present. I'll be right back to change my clothes. Nice, nice. A fantastic Chablis. Come on in. It's open. -Hello. -Hello? -Don't you recognize me? -You've cut your hair, right? -Yes. -Sit down, I'll get you some wine. -That was that photographer. -Really? I guess Astrid must have... -Astrid hasn't showed up yet. -Amazing. -I painted that. -Amazing. -Do you want to see more? -Yes, please. -I have a studio upstairs. -So you paint? That's nice. I usually listen to talk radio while painting. So my art is always a comment on the world we live in. And right now, the greenhouse effect is a hot topic- -so I only paint greenhouses. Right, the greenhouse effect. A pretty unpleasant effect. And the colors you've chosen. Incredible, just amazing. I'm having an exhibition soon, which is a bit nerve wracking. -This country doesn't like talent. -Indeed. It's that classic Swedish envy. You can tell where Astrid gets her artistic side from. -Do you think so? -I think Astrid and I could do well. If we could just find an investor. Because you need your own studio, which isn't cheap. How well do you know Astrid? It's through the photography. -So you're friends? -Right. We looked at my paintings. He really liked them. -Wow. -Yeah. Jonny invited me. I mean, I couldn't say no. -Hi, Daddy. -Hello there. Glass of wine? Astrid invited me. I mean, I couldn't say no. Then you'll have to behave, because it's my reputation... -You can't do wet snuff here. -Why not? -Don't they use snuff? -Yes, but... They know it's not high class, so they can do it. Because they know. -Now I know it too, so I can do it. -No, because you're not upper class. So they know you don't know. Come on. Here's the deal. For the upper classes there's no such thing as upper class. You just are. You don't talk about accomplishments or important people you know. You don't talk about politics, feminism or money. Nothing that you could disagree about. -So what do they do? -Go boating, hunting and drinking. And go hunting. -Hi there. -Hello, Jonny Boy. -For Pompe. -Thank you. How about more salt? And maybe just a touch of sugar. I see you've been picking buckshot all day. -Yes. Do you hunt? -Of course. Anything you can kill. -Buck? -Yep. Always ready at buck season. -What do you use to shoot pigeon? -Not Holland & Holland, like you. Hold on, I'll show you something. -Barrels? -Side by side. Damn it. Come here, let me show you something. Watch the pot. - This way. I went to Christie's, you know. In London. I won the bidding on these. Look at the shape they're in. Feel them. They were made in 1 927, you know. -Amazing. -And they've been re-stocked. -Easy to open. -Yes. -They can't have been cheap. -I'll take that. You know, I have a hunting lodge in Sörmland. What do you say to a weekend there? -And try out the guns? -Yeah. -You shoot air rifles, right? -Oh, yes. As a photographer, what do you say about Astrid? -She's incredibly talented. -Do you think so? We're talking about getting a studio. I have some great business ideas. You know, I might need your help. Astrid seems to listen to you. She can't end up like her mom and pretend to be an artist. Photography is just her way of avoiding responsibility. She gets burned out in a week at a regular job. She's been turned into some sort of...security junkie. Anything difficult has been removed for her. It's all a game. -Where do you live? -I rent a room from Jonny. In my apartment? I see. -Is he getting paid? -No, he's not. Good, because he doesn't pay rent. Not that he can afford to. Here you go. Go for the left one. If you could talk to her and let her know photography isn't for her... I've already spoken to this Jonas she's working for. Or not working for, she doesn't even get a salary. So, if you write a few lines about your business idea... If you help me, I'll help you. So, now it's time! To Pompe! -A toast. -Cheers. -Pompe? -Classe's grandfather's old horse. It's buried in the garden. They have a silly ceremony every year. Thank you for the photos, they were great. -Thank you. -Yours were nice too. But you couldn't tell it was us getting married. It's okay. We can take a hint. Robin, if you want to show your photos, you can join my exhibition. No, I don't know... -Do you want me to reserve tickets? -What? -For opening night. -What opening night? "The Soul". I told you about that. -I got a lead at the City Theater. -Oh my. -"The Soul". I play the soul. -I see. A dream part for all serious male actors. A classic, written by Jan Øyvind Salberg Gagnef Brøjs, a Dane. -What do you say? -Can you reach the water? Excuse me, I have to... Sorry, I had to keep it turned on- -because this Danish director was going to call me. This is Jonny Björk. Yes, okay. No, you called at just the right time. The theater...how boring. And the City Theater, aren't they a tad liberal? I think it's so silly when they run around on stage and stuff. Yeah, really. Like no one can tell it isn't real. How is he going to learn his lines? He hasn't learned to sail in ten years. Stop talking about Jonny. There's nothing wrong with Jonny Boy. Cecilia, could you get more wine from the cellar? -Robin, do you want to come along? -I'll go. - Come on, Robin. I'm sorry, but I really had to take that call. I'm kind of busy at the moment. Why don't you want to exhibit with my mom? -It's not the right forum for me. -The right forum? I don't get it. First you're some cheery Värmlander- -and now you show up like some...l don't know. I want to exhibit with you. You invited yourself to meet Dad, right? They always have some nutty priest or actor around to entertain them. A rustic Värmlander will be perfect. Astrid. That just won't do. Time for the oats. Three hoorays for Pompe. Hip hip! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray! Thanks for a great evening. It was amazing. -I had a great time, but I have to go. -I see. Please, come on inside, so we can continue. Where are you going? I don't know. Me neither. So maybe we're going in the same direction. -You're right. Do you want to try? -What? We'll make a combined portfolio, get our own studio. Let's do it together. Now you don't want to? It's all you've been talking about. Good morning. I'm sorry for being so...suspicious. But that was because of this person before you who... ...worked a little too hard to get close to my dad. Okay. Come here. There. Wait, look at me. There, and look out the window. Perfect. -Great. -Come here. -What's this? -That? I'm having it removed. -Let me see. -I'm removing it. Move. You could show some courtesy and at least close the door. That's private. I shouldn't have to feel like a boarder in my own home. Then again, if you only think about yourself... We have to start planning the exhibition, show the portfolio. I have to make some money. Where do you get your money from? -Robin here. -Claes Axelsson, Filipstad News. We hear that you're a big success in Stockholm. Your mom tipped us off. You're exhibiting your photos and live with that Jonny Björk. So what do you think of Molkom and your old life? Do you miss us? Isn't the pace a little much in Stockholm? Jonny wanted to join us hunting, but he just can't shut up. He'd scare off all the animals. I was thinking you could handle the entire deal. From wedding photographs and maybe even choosing the hymns. Do the seating charts, pick the music, the food and outfits... No. I don't think that sounds like anything. There's no market for that kind of thing. You know what? I think we should stay at the hotel instead. I can't be bothered making the beds at the hunting lodge. -I can't afford a hotel. -It's on me, of course. And moving pictures too. You film it all, from the bachelor party- -and then the wedding and the party afterwards. And then you get your own wedding movie. You can put it up online for family members to check out. Let's stop talking about that. It sounds like one of Jonny's ideas. Excuse me? Could we have two single malts, please? Well... Here's the deal. I get you a studio, a car and a few month's wages. I go in as half owner and you do what you want, okay? You're not playing both ends against the middle? You shouldn't get too emotionally invested. Astrid is off to the London office in three weeks. That's what I was thinking. Cecilia looked like that when I picked her up at a night club years ago. Kind and patient. Like a draft-horse. You know what Jonny thought? That he was getting her. Jonny Boy... I like him. -Right. -Thank you. -I think I have to go to bed. -I'll stay up a while. Thanks for a good day. Look me in the eye. You look people in the eye. You know what I like about you? You're a very good listener. Everyone else just wants to talk about themselves, but not you. -You're talented. Did you know that? -Thank you. Well, good night. Hey. That exhibition isn't happening, right? -No, it isn't. -Good. Hello. I'll just move here. Sitting alone is so boring. Dad here. l am so disappointed in you for staying away like this. l need the car tomorrow, the day after at the very latest. I've sold it for 40,000, so you have to bring the damned car home. Damn... Hey there. -Where have you been? -Pigeon hunting with Classe. I thought his name was Claes. I'm sick of his damned pigeons and ducks. If you're going to hunt it should be something worthwhile, like a moose. I think Classe got a bit annoyed when I didn't want to come hunting. -I couldn't say no when he asked. -Right. You've turned into a parasite, Robin. You're worming your way in, stealing other people's friends. If you keep sucking up to Claes you can move out of my apartment. But it isn't your apartment. Anyway, I'm not going hunting with Classe anymore. I see. It's not that I'm jealous of you, not at all. It's just... You've got to look at yourself in the mirror. It's a dangerous world. Society has turned into some sort of Disney movie. You try to tell the kids that lions are nice, but they aren't. You've got so much crap ahead of you, like marriage. When your old lady leaves you, she'll steal your money, kids and friends. And in the end you're passed over for some less qualified hag at work. No... We're living in dark times, Robin. A time for hags. Hi! I put together a joint portfolio. -Ouch. -What's the matter? I'm removing the tattoo with laser treatment. What? I spoke to my mom about the exhibition and I told her- -you'd share my wall there, so she asked if we were an item. And I said no. Nothing to do with you, it's Mom's problem. Did I pick the wrong pictures? No. No, you didn't. ls something wrong? ls it about us? -Robin. -Hi, Claes here. -Can you talk? -Just one second. Cecilia will call you today. I want you to tell her- -we spent the night at the lodge, not the hotel. -Why is that? -It's because... -What do you mean? -If I'm lying, I'd like to know why. But... I think you understand what happened at the hotel. -So you want me for your alibi? -That's one way of putting it. I don't really feel comfortable lying. Okay. What do you want? Tell me. Tell me. -Cecilia, a picture? -Of course. My daughter is also exhibiting. -Hello. -Hello. I'll take that one. And that one. -See? -Yeah. They're nice, after all. Classe always has agents buy his wife's ugly paintings. There's one. He'll switch them up so you don't recognize them. I'm going home to Värmland tomorrow. -Just for the day. -Right. Bring Alice along. Astrid? She'd die if she went there. No, they'd die of envy. Use the opportunity to shut them up. Don't you want to show me things? Like your old school? No. There's nothing to see here. Just one thing. I'm not responsible- -for all the dumb things my mom and dad will say. Hi! You're looking great. -Hello. -What is this car? It's your car. We're taking the train home. -And where is my car? -Screw it. This one's better and more expensive. -How could you afford it? -Welcome, Astrid. I'm glad you came along. -I hope you like Thai food. -Of course. -Ove Johansson. -Astrid. It's nice here. -What do you mean? -Everything. The scenery is lovely. You say that, but I'm sure you've seen lots of pretty things. Astrid, let me show you the house so Ove can talk to Robin. -I'm going to have a talk with you. -What about? We'll do it round the back. -Can you take this? -You take it yourself. MOLKOM IS DEATH It's a joke. "'The factory closing was the best thing for Molkom."' "'You grew up in a fart bubble. Why have a barbecue-"' "'-if everything smelled of ass?' says Robin after moving to Stockholm." -But it's true! -"Rural folks want it all." "If they lose their jobs, they won't move and want money." That's how it is here. Should I have lied? You don't know what we've sacrificed to give you a good life. Not that easy on two workers' salaries. But we did our best. And here is where I'm supposed to be ashamed. -Are you like the upper class now? -What do you know about them? -Maybe you've seen them on TV. -I'm not jealous, you know. I don't want to be like them. I'm a simple person. Simple person? Who the hell wants to be a simple person? Not me. It was so odd, let me show you. I was thumbing through... Let's see. I don't usually buy these magazines- -but the last name is unusual so I figured it was you and your mom. Wonderful picture. Lovely dress. -They didn't photograph Robin? -He didn't want to. That's just like his dad, you know. I have to admit, I was very nervous about your arrival. Robin has been calling, scolding us about how to behave. We're not to... We're not to do this or that. You can only be yourself, after all. He doesn't want you to know that we're out of work- -and that he lives at home. But here's how I see it, you're like anyone else. -I hope so. -Except much prettier. Her grandfather was a swine. He moved his companies abroad. I've checked that out. The wallet is not the brain. Mom's father was a Nazi. Not on the inside. What a bad response, Robin. They're the ones paying for the welfare you're on now. Think about that. I know what it's like when people think you're putting on airs. Ove used to be a foreman here. -And this street is called "uptown". -I see. But I always try to treat people as equals. I try to talk to and interact with everyone. It's important. It's kind of a philosophy that I have. The way I figure it... -When we die we're all the same. -That's true. It guess it sounds a bit cocky. I do try to find the time. What kind of business is Robin doing with your dad? Anything exciting? He hasn't said anything to me. And not to you either? -I really don't know. -That will be Bobby and Malin. Listen, one thing... I don't really know how to say this. Bobby is a bit special. He's not from uptown, so to speak. -He's very emotive, but we ignore it. -Not a problem. Go ahead, Astrid. -Is that your look now? -Is that your look? -What's your problem? -What's yours? Never mind. Do you get any sleep or does little Metallica keep you up? -Metallica? -She's so cute. Are you really calling her Metallica? Poor kid. We want her to be unique. Everyone is born unique. That's the cheapest luxury you can give your kid, a cool name. -If you're not swimming in money. -What does that mean? -I think it's beautiful. -Right. You're just saying that. No. Must you chew that loud? She just fell asleep. We shouldn't sit here all night. It's about to begin downstairs. Bernt, here's the question for 50,000 crowns. Who founded H&M in 1 94 7? -Do we have to eat in front of the TV? -But "Millionaire" is on. That's really nice. There, just dig in. Before we start eating, l...or we would like to give you a present. Thank you. How nice. -What did it cost? -You don't ask that. -90 crowns, I think. -I see. Then I want to show you something. Come with me. You answered correctly and have 50,000 crowns! Man, she never stops grinning. And what about his lordship over here? She made him that way. Her dad has like 200 million. -Crowns? -I think so. Gunnarson bought this for us in Germany, an entire wine cellar. It's no wine cellar. It's a laundry room with bag in box wine. Guess what he paid? 4,368 crowns. For all of this. It's the equivalent of 1 68 bottles. 26 crowns per bottle. Why spend 90 on one bottle when you can get a wine cellar... Maybe because it's a better wine? It's not a competition, is it? I just thought it was a fun thing to show you. I hope you survive. What the hell is it? -A toast to sis and her baby. -And to Bobby too. -A toast. -Hip, hip! Hooray, hooray, hooray, hooray! -Actually, it's just three hoorays. -Are you dumb? Of course it's four. Read up on it and you'll find it's only three. -Of course it's four. -Right. I have something to say. We're not afraid to move away from here. -Nope. -We want to live here. -Yep. -We don't want to go elsewhere. -Nope. -Not me, anyway. -Exactly. -Interesting. ls anyone taking notes? Quiet, it's starting. This is for 50,000 crowns. In what film did Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro first collaborate? -"Taxi Driver". -"Mean Streets", maybe. No, that's not a Scorsese movie. -..."Taxi Driver" or "Dödspolarna". -It's not even an alternative. "Dödspolarna" was the Swedish title and "Mean Streets" the original. "Dödspolarna"is correct, you have 50,000 crowns! The Swedish title is what counts in Sweden. -Good excuse, Dad. -Stop it, Robin. l want to know what Abraham Lincoln's nickname was. -Honest Abe! -Little Lincoln, Accurate Abraham... -...Honest Abe. -l'm going for C. I bet you're real proud coming here to show her off, all rich and snobby. Ove, do something! Stop it! Who do you think you are with your pissing contest? We're all going to die one day. And then it doesn't matter what color your hair is- -or how much money you make, because then, death is all you have. You think about that. Pathetic. Honest Abe! You have won 100,000 Swedish crowns! I thought you'd be happy now that I'd made it. Thanks for your hospitality. Five questions to one million, two lifelines left. -Only two for you answer. -If the others get it right. Right. Exactly. -Want to go on? -Of course. Astrid? I defended you when Bobby attacked you. Bobby is such a loser. He got a tattoo in Thailand- -of the Chinese symbol for "fear". When he came home, the waitress at the Chinese restaurant- -asked why his arm said "foot massage". -Don't ignore me, you stuck-up bitch! -What are you saying? Just trying to get a reaction. Stop playing the bumpkin when it suits you. Don't you see? You provoke them when you come off like some lord! -But they're retarded. -That's your family! You can't get rid of your background! Your mom said you do business with my dad. -We don't do business. -What paid for the car and studio? -I told you. Loans. -I don't believe you. Where the hell is the station? -Let me put my luggage... -Don't ride with me. Take another cab, damn it. I've never heard anything so silly. Would l do business with him? No way. Did he tell you that? Well? "Do you know what life is?" "Life is that misery between benders." "Why despise the man who walks numbed through the horrors?" "Why exalt a painful trudge over glass into something noble-" "-when comfort eludes you, sneering at you as you writhe in pain?" "Smile, mortal. Borrow from the future, intoxicate yourself." -Amazing. -This will be magical. Me, this script and the main stage of the City Theater... Rage! Rage against youth unknowing of how to really travel through life. Whisper! Whisper it to youth: approach life as a love dance. Love...so deceitful. Work, so sincere. Known to anyone that has stared into the bitter maw of pointlessness. You speak as if all were at an end. Love! Love now, Wolfgang. How can I love when I have never tasted love? Words only someone demanding could speak. Someone exacting. Where are the open arms? Now l know life is but a poor background. Are you speaking in riddles again? Why can't you see life like it is? A simple melody. You demand, but you never give. In a mist of self-pity, you've wandered alleyways so damp... Do you know what life is? Life is that misery between benders, Jonny! Life is that misery between...between benders. Why despise the man who walks numbed through the horrors? Why exalt a painful trudge over glass into something noble when comfort... Intoxicate yourself. Borrow from the future. There is no meaning, there is no God, there is no... ...plan! Smile, mortal, smile. There is only a brief second of joy on this Earth. Smile, mortal, smile. A toast! A toast! -Thanks for the show. -How do you feel? -Well...it's alright. -I thought it was awesome. I was super touched at the end when you killed yourself. I'm sure some people thought that was a relief. -Was Classe here? -Was he supposed to be? I sent him two tickets, so... It's just as well, never mind. -I'll see you dumpling day. -I'm not invited. -Cecilia hasn't invited me lately. -She asked me to invite you. -Did she now? -Dumpling day? Classe makes potato dumplings in August every year. It's open! Come on in! Hello. We visited Robin's parents in Värmland. Go with Mom and I'll be right there. -Hello, Daddy. -Hello. -I invited Jonny. -Yes, I heard. Could you get wine from the cellar? There's the list. So, what do your parents do? Mom runs a kitchen and my dad is in industry. -As a representative. -I see. Excuse me a moment. Hi, Classe. -You're a real cockroach, you are. -I'm sorry I forced you to... They're great survivors, cockroaches. I've noticed your talents. You show no fear. No. -You're a hell of a survivor. -Yeah. We're going to have a talk later, you and me. Okay. -So, what do his parents do? -They're unemployed. That's not what he told me. He said they were bosses of some kind. Why do you think he picked you? Why did you pick Dad? -Where's Jonny? -Probably licking his wounds. That review was a frightening read. It was more of an assassination than a review. It was awful. But that theater is subsidized, so who cares if no one shows up? How can theaters get state money when a painter can't get it? -Where was the review? -In the Culture section. Where reviews usually are. Let me go get it. Does she need to go get it? How tiring. "Jonny Björk as 'The Soul' is the most hollow thing-" "-ever seen on a professional theater stage." -How awful. -"It raises the question..." "...if he's even chosen the right stage entrance." -That's what it says! -You even underlined it. The writing really got to me. You can't write things like that. -Robin, you were there, right? -Yes. How did he do, Jonny Boy? Well? He was... He was god awful. "When it comes to timing and interplay-" "-Björk's acting is like a lost Santa Claus on Midsummer's Eve." -Hello, everybody! -Jonny Boy! Welcome! -Hi there. How are you doing? -Great. -A bit worn out after the show. -Should I heat something? -No, I'll do it myself. -Grab yourself a beer. -I'm just trying to be nice. -You sold him out. I don't want to make a scene, is all. -Did you already eat, Jonny? -Nope. I'll just fill up on drink. Jonny, want to help me sail the boat up next weekend? -I perform on weekends. -Too bad. Especially considering the reviews. -Really? I haven't read anything. -No? -No one else either? -No. -Cecilia? -No. -Robin? -No. I see. I see. For those of you who have an interest in culture- -I can tell you the play has been canceled. Last time was tonight. -That's too bad. -Do you think so? Reviewers just have opinions and never create anything. -And what do you do? -My opinions are just a hobby. Stop grinning before I make you wear your own cunt like a hat, bitch. -Relax, Jonny Boy. -I'm no Jonny Boy. -Never have been and never will be. -Do we want a tenant like that? He means nothing by it. -Astrid, you need a bigger apartment. -Shut up, Mom. Mrs Cunt? Do you know Claes sends agents to your exhibitions- -to buy your ugly paintings, since no one wants them? To make sure Mrs Cunt doesn't get sad. Are you coming, Robin? He's a nobody. It has to hurt to find that out. We went too far this time. There's nothing wrong with Jonny Boy. It'll be fine once he's... He'll be back when he gets thirsty. -Let's go. -I think I'm staying. I'll sleep here tonight. Didn't you notice what just happened in there? And where do you stand? If you lie about your parents, what else are you lying about? Let's have a talk. Are you tanning now? Sorry that I didn't leave with you. Jonny? Jonny? -Don't become like me. -No. Time to get up! I have ideas about how to solve the apartment situation. Jonny? Jonny? Jonny? -Where is he? -They're treating him right now. -Was it an accident? -Don't think so. But we can pretend. -Excuse me. How's Jonny doing? -I'll have to get back to you. I've been lying to you all along. I did what Claes did and paid people to buy your photographs. The car and studio came from your dad. He wants me to work for him. -You're the most deceitful, sickest... -I know, but dump your dad instead. Don't let him support you. Take pictures or toss the damned camera. You can run your own life too, can't you? It's not about my dad, it's about you using me! I went behind your back so you could keep doing photography. Why can't you treat me like a normal person? What did I ever do to you? You're afraid of leaving your background behind. But that's what I did. -I did all the work. -How swell of you. The perfect victim. The young worker who sees through the upper classes- -and protests. Bravo, applause from the audience. Guess what, Robin? You're afraid. You'd never dare speak your mind to Claes. ERASE CONTACT? JONNY BJÖRK DEAD FRIEND: "HE WAS DEPRESSED" REST IN PEACE THE DJURSHOLM FRIENDS We are gathered here today to say goodbye to Jonny Maximilian Björk. I'm sure many of us thought we knew Jonny. Many who say, "This is what Jonny was like. This is what he thought." But maybe we didn't really know Jonny. Maybe we didn't know what burdens Jonny carried. There is only one who can know how Jonny really felt. And that's Lord God the Father. So why didn't he do anything? What was that? Life is a gift from God. But life is also fragile. One day, the body grows tired and the heart stops beating. But sometimes, the soul grows tired. What are you doing? There. Keep going. -You can't do that! Who are you? -Someone who knew Jonny. Go out there right away and bring it back. Otherwise, you can just leave. I'm not continuing until you get it back. Where are you going? I don't know. Me neither. Then we might be going the same way.
