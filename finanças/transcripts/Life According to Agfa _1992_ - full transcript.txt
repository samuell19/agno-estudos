Micro biology, not your micro. ''On the second day... ''The first day we had a meeting ''He went to check, he went to check... ''He knows the area, every rock, every...'' Doctor Feldman. -Hello. -l didn't know exactly where it was. Hello, Ricky, l apologize about the strange location, you called me just half an hour ago and... And my house is a mess. l'm very sorry, l apologize. So... Let's sit down. Come, don't worry. Come on. Come sit. Are you embarrassed here in this park? Maybe we, who knows, we'll make a big breakthrough, and we'll start analyzing in the park. Sit. What happened? l want to commit myself. All right, come tomorrow to the ward and we'll see. Why? Two days ago l couldn't take it anymore and went to the Kibbutz. l got off at the entrance and walked to the dining hall's parking lot. lt was around seven o'clock. The lot was already dark, and the entrance to the dining hall was lit. l stood there watching until l saw Gideon with Shir on his shoulders, coming out of the dining hall. Shir... Shir laughed at something Gideon said to him and... and they played a game where... where Shir put his hands over Gideon's eyes and Gideon... He purposely went towards the bushes, and Gideon pretended to stumble into them. He made this funny squeaking noise. And l burst into tears, and l knew that if l went up to him he wouldn't recognize me after a year. And Gideon would get mad that l didn't let him know l was coming after a year. l wanted to hug them and kiss Shir, who l once was ready to kill. Then l ran away from there and got on a bus and didn't stop crying the whole way... l couldn't get them out of my mind... Mind. And l wanted to die. l took Antomin in the room and on the way... because l couldn't stop crying, except for once, when l laughed because l opened the window and saw l was only on the second floor and l want to commit myself. Don't you have any more red ones? You know, l once wanted to write and publish an article, ''Loneliness as a disease''. lt isn't a symptom or a mental disorder. lt's a disease, a real disease. l didn't publish only because l don't really know what's happening to you. You can imagine 1 7 billion neurons going with you to the Kibbutz and seeing your husband and son laughing, and then a current from here, a chemical from there, send you back to your room crying with the resolve to commit suicide. Try not to be alone until tomorrow morning. Okay. -Come, Carlotta, come. And take a pill each time you feel like dying. Ricky, you're not to be alone until tomorrow at nine o'clock. l don't care how you do that, you hear? All right. -Promise me? Okay, goodbye. ''We came as black as soot ''we came ripped up but... ''we are after Rafiah ''just like you wanted the dew.'' Okay, Kirsch, for the last time before l stick it in your ass, when and where were you supposed to pick up the rest of the goods? Come on, Benny, do me a favor, they'll kill me. Take his pants off. -Are you sure? Tzvi said that... -Rami, forget about Tzvi, l want Kirsch's ass now. Come on. Turn around and bend over. ''ln front of the enemy we burst through ''Those who fell, fell... ''over the dead...'' Check it out, 50 grams of Persian Coke in a condom. Quite a warehouse you have up your ass, Kirsch, so what do you say? We stop here and you tell us something or do l go back in amd get the other one? Huh? -l made up to meet two l've never seen before in my life... at midnight at the docks. They said they'll be in an old American car. Good. Good. You can stick whatever is left in your ass up your nose. As a gift from me. So don't say l didn't treat you well. We'll say it's for personal consumption... Throw him in solitary confinement until tomorrow morning and pick me up at the ''Barbie'' at eleven thirty. Just the two of us? -Just the two of us? Yes, just us. l do the job alone in any case while you sit in the car holding your balls praying that l finally screw up. Just the two of us, there will be bugging, that is enough. ''On the fifth of June...'' Come on, let's go. That Benny is the worst in the department. There is worse. -Who? -The one who gave him the job. Come. lt's so quiet. What is this, a library? Maybe save some silence for the wake? Very funny, but you still go every night to the ''Barbie'' and return at three or four a.m. After all that vodka and that Daliah. Tell me, what did that Daliah tell you? Maybe that your cancer is blind and it's retreating? ''Till joy, till wealth... ''Homeland ''Till joy, till wealth...'' Hello. -Hello, yes. l wanted to ask you if you need work, that is, if you need a waitress or something like that. No. So can l have some juice? -What juice? -lt doesn't matter. l'm out of ''it doesn't matter''. So orange. No, no, grapefruit. Can l have grapefruit? Yes. -Thank you. That'll be three Shekels. -All right. Here you go. ''Till joy, till wealth... ''Homeland ''Till joy, till wealth... ''l wasn't born, l am, l am an lsraeli ''l didn't bring you...'' Sorry. That's okay, get to work. Come, come, come... You want a line? -l don't touch that stuff. So come here a moment, hide me for a moment. Tell me, what happened to you? The soldiers threw stones at me. Stop! Just a second... This is for number 8, get up there already. -Okay? -Yes. Hi, how are you doing? -Fine. -Hey, put this in its place for me. Hi. How are you? Navah was late, she won't look me in the eye. And? -Now everyone is okay. They reserved more places... The Ofer couple from ''Nachushtan'' and the guy from ''Pladelet''. Did Eli call? -No. Hi. How are you? Good evening. ls everything all right? Hi. Thank you. ''l never heard you say l need you ''l don't need you ''l need you ''l don't need you ''and all of these games...'' So, what's happening, Sammy? The same, but different. And with you? -The same, but exactly. Hello, lDF. Hello, l'm Nimrod Arbel, lieutenant colonel, but you can call me Nimi. These are my soldiers, they took me out for some fun... From lchilov Hospital, orthopedic ward. Here we are. ls this from last night's operation? l saw it in the newspaper. No, it's from a screwed-up parachute jump, l fell like a ton of bricks. l hope it doesn't ruin your place's image. No... ''Barbie'' is short for ''Abarbanel''. And anyway, l know the local decadence, my customers will be sure this is the new army uniform. Okay, guys, come, make yourselves at home. Come on in. The first beer is on me, on the house. Navah will be here soon, she'll serve the military proudly. She should keep her head down so we will be able to see her face. Navah. Navah, come. Benny, are you sure about these pills? l'm throwing up and bleeding. Daniela, l heard you got a visa. Are you flying? Benny, where are these pills from? Really, these pills are fine, they're from Holland. You're bleeding because of the abortion, the nausea will disappear when you stop putting shit up your nose. What are you, stupid? Navah looks like you went through her. All you have left are Daliah, Samir and Mahmoud. What's going on? What's wrong with you? You have three orders waiting. l didn't feel well, l vomited. -Well. Did you take something to make you feel better? Get a hold of yourself and get to work. No, no, you know you can't take pictures of me l photograph using sensitive, x-ray style materials, you can see crimes and misdemeanors even from the back. Call Czerniak now, okay? Hurry. ''He doesn't understand ''why there are still Arabs ''after the special forces passed through ''So who did the commander tell ''the important thing is to charge ''we must beat the hell ''out of our fucking cousins.'' Here's to the future dead! -Cheers. -Cheers. Lieutenant colonel Nimi, aren't you pushing it a little? Two beers and you've already become the military religious choir, huh? Stop going wild with the glasses, okay? Each glass costs money here. So give us one of your beauties, we'll take her to the yard, penetrate her with our entire force... Listen, soldier, this isn't a party and it isn't a brothel, okay? This is where people come after lying for hours staring at the ceiling. And there are no corners, so that people can't be alone. How about you? Lets have a quickie while standing in the yard, what do you say? You have quite a pipe there. Are you sure it isn't your catheter? Standing in the yard... Limping in the yard at best. ln any case, definitely not in my yard. Finish this last beer on the house and get the hell out of here. And don't let me see your butt-faces ever again, okay? Navah... Standing in the yard, piece of shit. Tell me, weren't you a weapons instructor at the Julis army base? At ease, stupid. lf you touch me, nobody will be able to recognize you afterwards. Five beers, huh? -Yes. ''We haven't started anything yet ''and nothing was started by us ''and if you give us some more time ''you'll soon see who we are. Leora, it's Eli. ls Daliah there? Hello. -My permit to be with you through the ''take a condemned man to lunch'' club is in danger. Where are you? -The coast road, on the way to you. Half and hour, there's a horrible traffic jam. lt's sad here, crowded here, annoying here. We miss you here. -Bye. What about your head, Samir? Did you get your country yet? What day is it? Tuesday or so. So not yet. Did they say anything on the weather forecast? Don't know, l don't watch television. Don't watch television. God, finally, really. l started to think you got one of your allergies or your flu. Listen, there's a group of soldiers here who are exasperating me. Driving me crazy with their singing. So do me a favor, no long breaks, and... do something. Why must you disturb me just when l'm writing poetry? Writing poetry. -Listen to this Leonard Cohen some more. Do me a favor, get me a glass of water. Daniela, get him a glass of water. Hi. l got an American visa. l'm out of this idiotic country in 2 weeks. Now? ln the middle of my loving you? Good evening, l'm Czerniak. Who smells your sweat in the crowd and the sound of your ego trip while you run down the properties until your ass is sweating from heat and l hear the commerce and rumors, exchange and envy, one hand or another, and l see all your little women swimming in a sea of makeup after making out with the microwave and the dishwasher and fantasizing that a combat soldier will conquer them from behind, they will smell the uniform and rifle and the scent of the large homeland wrapped in shrouds and the flag and smelling the flowers from beneath. So way to go for the lDF for blowing up our Samir's head. He's smiling. And l'm singing to him. lt's seems like we've fallen into the asshole of the left-wing. Affirmative. ''Samir, Samir, Samir, what will become of you? ''With the sanitary pad on your head. ''Samir, Samir, Samir, ''When, will you return the punch and the beating and the curse ''the light to the gentiles and the virtue ''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up ''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up ''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up.'' ''My Lord, my Lord, ''may it never end ''the battle and the tension ''the trembling in the belly ''and the butt of the rifle ''stopped in the guts ''the close range ''the sparkle in the eyes ''the body of an Arab ''without his head, without his dick.'' l bet you a beer she doesn't enter? Bet you a beer she does? Excuse me, can l pass? -On to me? Sure. Do you know you have the honor of sitting on the spear's head? Three days ago it took out three with one magazine. Enough, enough. Sorry, l didn't come here for this, l... l need the manager. l'm your watchdog, baby. And you are the homeland that will blow me and maybe my soldiers too. You can feel it, huh? Hello, let her go, she was coming to me. Hey, hey, the lDF doesn't come to anyone you came to me on your own free will, right? Hey, hey, hey, we have an undercover cop here, protecting sluts, he hasn't heard that nobody steps on lieutenant colonel Nimrod without the management making a note of it. Right, management? -Right. Maybe we should go somewhere else? What about the victory? We'll go without victory on the battle field? ''On the first day l made a date ''l screwed her standing up ''the second day after a stake-out ''she came to blow me during the battle ''join the special forces unit...'' -Have a drink, you're shaking. Thank you, but no thank you. He really scared me, and l came in to inquire about a job, that is, l wanted to ask if you need a waitress or something else. Daliah, the girl is asking if we need a waitress or something. We don't need any work today, tomorrow... Maybe tomorrow. What's your name? Ricky, Ricky Naor. Actually it's Rivka Naor. Ricky is like a long nickname... Where are you from? -l... l'm from Kibbutz Maoz, l have a husband and child there. This is my husband Gideon with Shir on him. Two years ago. And the three of you are together? -l'm alone. Especially this past year. You know how it is on a kibbutz, crowded, like here. So l'll go. Do you know the way to Rupin from here? Come, let's get you out safely and then l'll show you the way to Rupin. All right? -Yes, yes. You can't leave without forgiving us. We were drinking, we went too far. l apologize. l forgive you. Listen, you asshole, if you keep harassing people in public places, you and your group of morons will end the night behind bars, get it? You already brought your pajamas. Tell me, how about on the way to Rupin we'll stop for a... congress at my place on Basel? -All right. This city has a kind of sour smell, like something rotted here. Like one big argument. l think being alone is a type of landscape in this city. And l can't take it anymore. -What? -Never mind. Really doesn't matter. Thank you... Hello. -How are you? -Great, thanks. Come have a seat. Hi, hello. -Hello. -Hello, hello, hello. Come on in. How? Really... How did you do that? Bacardi and Coke? You look like a demolition order. Since l invented this cancer my family has become catatonic. Since you invented that lie, you fell in love with it a bit, and you're walking around arm in arm with death. What is this bullshit... You told me yesterday... l dreamt... A group of accountants is counting white blood cells and finds an overdrawn account. You're killing me with your nonsense, honey. -Oh, how l love you. You idiot. What happened? Two years ago l spent 5,000 dollars on this shit. First l snorted it, then it snorted me, until Benny took me to Meir gardens one night to see eight Arabs screwing each other for a hit. You'll get to New York only through postcards. You'll give what you give for free for only one gram you'll give Benny, for example. Do me a favor, get off my back. He told me you're only roommates. He didn't sing to you? Ask you if you finished before you even started? Got all pleased with himself and didn't give a damn about you... Don't answer me! l don't know why l care if you snort your life away. How are you? -Like another beer. Another beer for Sammy. Do l look sick to you? l've been staring at you for a month, and l feel like telling you, ''Why don't you lie down?'' You sound like a lament. Or Doctor Fuchs. Vodka, beer. -Thank you very much. Daniela, This is for you before you go. ''Don't forget this moment ''The air in your chest ''When you pack the light that moves over your face ''losing the traces of you ''only the soft beauty you left behind ''when you left here, when you left here ''and my body language is shouting out to you ''from now until forever ''Daniela ''Daniela ''losing the traces of you ''only the soft beauty you left behind ''when you left here, when you left here ''and my body language is shouting out to you ''from now until forever ''Daniela ''Daniela. ''And there is no reply from your body language ''that you took with you ''Daniela ''Daniela.'' God, you're... l'm going to a place where no one will sing me a love song, a sucker with a big dream and a little spoon. Hey, hey... lt'll be all right. America. ''The sun will halt between Gaza and Rafiah ''The moon...'' Are you a photographer? No, no, this is my roommate's. l'm a cop. You're not upset about my hands, right? No, no, not at all. And if l turn you towards me, do you think we'll kiss? l... l don't sleep with men. l forget... Cops are lonelier than men. The light... The light is very harsh here, no? lt's a little irritating. -No problem. l left a bit of light so we can still... Look at each other. Wait, wait, l haven't even asked you if you want to be with me. Yes, yes, why wouldn't l? Can we just do this with our clothes on? Please. No problem. Are we good? Of course we're good. You're kind of strange, are you okay? No, l'm not okay. But continue, officer. What a nice gun. No, no, give that to me, give it to me please. Ricky, did you come? Yes. -Yes? Well, l have to run, so... You need to get to Rupin, right? But... Can l stay a little longer, just to look around? Okay, okay, but slam the door behind you. You go down eight floors, then left onto Dizengoff, from there until Gordon and you'll get to Rupin. lt was great, right? -Yes. You are something else. -So are you. No, l... l know what you're saying, you're something else. -Thanks. Okay, l have to run. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Vicky, Benny, someone pick up, l need something urgently, come on! Hello? -Where's Benny? He left. Listen, Vicky, l'm out of photo equipment, so do me a favor and bring me the gray bag under the phone, okay? All right. He said you were his roommate and didn't... Do me a favor, let me take care of his screwing and the sluts he brings back, okay? Concentrate on getting the material. ''ln the yard of the kibbutz ''ln the place where the summer ''is red and burning ''but the boiler is burning ''and even more scorching... ''That's where the armored forces...'' ''ln a minute we'll rip them apart ''and the blood will flow like water ''and we'll remember them all ''Rifat and Yusuf and Sayid, ''the rounds from the machine gun that fired ''at them all, ''from their heads to their dicks.'' Cheers, guys! -Cheers! -Cheers! ls the military Peugeot outside yours? Do you want to give us a ticket? No, somebody slit two of your tires. Gadi, go outside, check out what happened. Hello, -So here's how it goes, first of all, the keys. Tomorrow morning come with... l'll give you a suitcase with all your belongings. Now l'm apparently supposed to tell you what l think of you? So what can l say about air that passed through my apartment? Zero is a huge number compared to you. The level of your conversations... ls like bonfire sing-a-longs. You managed to turn my apartment into one big darkroom. What are you doing? Someone doesn't like us here, our tires were slit. Please. ltzik, come here. Haim, Haki, Shaul, stay by the door. Your Arabic sucks. Why not try Hebrew? This is how it sounds in Hebrew. l'm from Taibeh, l'm from Taibeh, l'm an lsraeli. Benny, Benny, hurry, he's killing him. Who gave us the flat tire? -l don't know. Who gave us the flat tire? Now listen carefully, this area is lsraeli and these guys are lsraeli, so you carried on an investigation without the right to investigate and you used force without the right to use even a lighter. ln short, you have five minutes to wrap up the choir and get out. Come on... Are you hurt? He said to turn the other cheek for the army that sings pretty well. Can you call us a taxi? -Yes, call you a taxi. l'm sorry we went too far. -Leora, call a taxi, quickly. ''And to our country, our homeland ''she belongs to us, this country ''and our countrymen, our homeland ''the need of our people is the need of generations.'' Taxi to the Barbie. ln a minute? Thanks. ''We'll build up our country in spite of our destroyers ''we'll build up our country with our willpower ''the end of slavery ''the fire of freedom is burning the hope is aglow ''in us the people will sing.'' Shall we go? Where? -To Ramla. -To the base? -Yes. Go. You should know, Tzvi is listening in, he demanded that. Come on, go. Would you like a cup of tea? -Later. l'm fine, l have the flu, maybe l drank too much, but l'm fine. A cup tea with mint... You know what? Drive to my house, l'll be there within half an hour. Okay. -Okay. -Okay. You won't run away? -Run away, no, l'm fine. l'm 1 00 percent fine. Are you all right to drive? -l can drive. So get out of here quickly. Okay. -Drive carefully. -Bye. -Bye. Smile, as if you're happy. As if something good is happening to you. We keep... Missing something that will never happen. He's at my place ten months, not with me. You get him in doses of three hours a night, his wife gets the rest. Doesn't your little brain understand that those three hours are the only hours of my life? The rest is near life, not real life. Arrangements, procedures. Go, get, close, open. Shit. Shit... shit. Cover me. Come on, get out! Come out with your hands up. Come on, don't move. Come on, come out with your hands up. Hurry, quickly. Don't move. l said don't move! Tell your friend to come outside. You've had it, huh? Come on. Don't move or l'll blow your brains out, you asshole. What are you waiting for? -You tell me. Where were you, huh? You asshole? Where were you? What are you doing stuck in the car? Can't you see l'm being beaten up? You know what you are? You're a little shitty nothing, that's what. a little shitty nothing. You've been waiting for this moment, right? Come in, Eastwood, l'll take you to the hospital. No hospital, drop me off at Leora's. Okay, l messed up myself this time. The got away in an American car, 1 86, 1 96, armed, yes, armed. l want to meet you at your usual dump in exactly an hour. What happened to you? -Nothing. What are you doing here? Nothing. Looking at the view. The night here is like a day... l was looking so much that l forgot to bring your girlfriend the black bag. Hold on, hold on, hold on. She called? Yes. -And you picked up the phone? She's your girlfriend, right? -Yes. All right, all right, listen, l'll bring her the bag already, l'm going in to shower and l'm asking you to please get out of here. l'm your screw? That's the way it is. She called me Vicky. My name isn't even Vicky. ''The soldiers went on a military march ''walked bravely and in song... ''But suddenly as they unpacked ''they realized they forgot the bread ''and the commander shouted it's awful with no bread... ''The soldiers went on a military march ''walked bravely and in song... ''The soldiers went on a military march, walked...'' Ricky? ''walked bravely and in song... ''But suddenly as they unpacked ''they realized they forgot the bread ''and the commander shouted it's awful with no bread... ''they realized they forgot the matches ''and the commander shouted it's awful with no fire ''And the platoon must march the whole way back... ''Then a soldier named Mantsur said ''if there's no fire, we'll use flint... ''Then a soldier named Mantsur said ''if there's no fire. we'll use flint...'' Listen, Daliah, there is a couple in the restroom. -Do l look good? Like a million dollars. -So get them out, gently. Okay, hand me my bag, l'm going home for half an hour. What an affair, only half an hour at the end of the night. A real ad for sleeping pills. Ciao. -Goodbye. Sammy... the restroom. l'm asking you to come out, continue at home. -Oh... at home? Really, what else? With my parents and my sister, her husband and their three kids? And their newborn baby? -And what about you? My wife is at home, okay? And... So continue outside. We were already there, where it is full of dog and cat shit. All right, l'll tell you what, two more minutes and you're out. Give us five more minutes, do us a favor... Oh... We're really loving now. Yuda'leh... -Fine, five minutes and then you're outside. l don't want to see you here. They'll be right out. What happened? -The bad guys won. Did someone look for me? -No. Did the psycho leave? -Yes. Get me something to drink please. Listen to me well, l'm going home, but by seven a.m. l want to hear one of the two: Either you go north at eight, take command of the unit sitting in Metulla for at least a year, so that at least you'll spend your nights in south Lebanon. There are no all night bars there but there are drug smuggling deals non-stop. ln short, it'll be a shitty job, but a job non-the-less. Or you quit or will be fired by seven a.m. Your call. -Did you catch them? No, but we caught you and you know what? You're just too expensive for us. You drink to much, screw too much. And we're offering you the north. lt'll promote your rank, and maybe even demote your ego level. ln any case Benny, if you decide to quit, you can always get a job as an actor in some American suspense series. Seven a.m. Benny, no later. And l'm offering you this, ''hombre''. Sounds pretty good. How much do you think Clint Eastwood gets offered for each movie? A million Shekel, easily. All right, all right, all right... Okay... Should l try hitting on you? -Hit on me, don't try to... Enough, no, no, no... Hello. -l'm Eli's wife, Mira. -Eli Shamgar? -Eli Shamgar. l was here eight months ago. ls my husband here? -No... -And Daliah? -No. Find them and tell them l'm here. ls there coffee? -Yes, right away. Leora. -What? Eli's wife is here, the one in green behind me. She asked that you call Daliah and make her a cup of coffee. Oh... Shit. Hello. -Daliah, trouble. Eli's wife is here waiting for you. Bye. Your wife is waiting for us at the pub. Just when l want to and finally can. -What happened? Why did she suddenly remember after ten months. What is this news to her? -l know, Maybe she realized the only cancer l have, is you. Right. Come. You must be the longest short-story l ever had. l didn't understand a word l just said. Shall we? -We shall. Take your hand off me, asshole! Three black coffees. Bring 'em over. Half a bottle of 41 ... What do you have to eat here? Huh? Bring me salads, hummus, bring, bring salads. Bring them. And this fucker should change the music to something middle-eastern. So we'll know who's who around here! Excuse me. You're not, you're not Oriental, are you? What exactly is your background? Did my ears just deceive me?! Fuck you, you... -Enough... -Moshe, baby, relax, honey. Enough. We don't sell half a bottle. We sell by glasses or by bottle. You'll give us half, you cunt. l'm going to get my head together in the restroom. Then l'll make order. There's no discipline, Moshe, no discipline. Son of a bitch! Whoever doesn't teach you discipline is a son of a bitch! Son of a bitch, huh? Come here, you dog, come. l want my hummus without your stench on it, understand? Lots of oil, parsley and olives. And a lot, a lot of pine nuts. Like you make for your fucking mother in your dump. You understand? Fuck. l understand. Can you say that again? ''You cunt''. Come on, say it. Mother fucker, move that camera, you asshole. -Good. Very good, again. Moshe, do something before l shorten... this squirt's life, her pussy and her pony tail. Come on, fucker, come on! And why is there no music here? Moshe. Mother fucker... We said middle-eastern music. Look, l... l tried to explain, We have a problem, you see, there's no entrance to coloreds... l said middle-eastern music. -Middle-eastern, middle-eastern. Great necklace. ''Samir, Samir, Samir, ''what will become of you? ''With the sanitary pad on your head. ''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up ''because Allah has chosen you among all other people ''to fuck us up...'' -Say, isn't this is a God-awful singer? ''Samir, Samir, Samir, ''what will become of you?'' Excuse me, sir? -What. l don't remember how you wanted your oil, hot, cold, boiling... What is this... You asshole! Are you all right, man? Whoever doesn't come back is crazy. ls it always this way here? Yes, and with you? Should we go in together? -You're very pale. Remind me to take you to the beach, it'll do you good. Fax it to me. Go in, go in, she's waiting for you. l want to talk to her. -Why? Because she might understand that if there is.. What? There's no chance. l think she knows. But talk to her. ln the meantime l'll go to the restroom and then pay. Then we'll go? She wants to talk to you. Okay, then... How do they say in the movies? Shoot, baby, or cut the bullshit. So? -Can you sit a moment? l'm seated. You know he has serious cancer? -He didn't tell me. lt's true he sometimes comes over pretty tired, but that might be from what he calls ''my catatonic house''. What cancer, where? Don't you think that if he hasn't left ''my catatonic house'' all these months, that says something about how he feels about us? Don't you think he has a plan... -Look, lady... l don't know what to call you, Mrs. Shamgar? This isn't Ca?Alexander and not... lt's the end of the night, not a good time to explore love, but there is love here, not easy for him, and definitely not for me. Check please. -Look, l... l don't live with him, and l'm not his doctor, and l'd like to hear all your diagnoses from him. After all, he's not a child anymore, right? ln any case, l'm not leaving him, if that's what you wanted. He won't leave you either. -Excuse me, but this drama sucks. Like the ones he distributes. You must admit there's a limit to this nonsense. Good night. You'll come tomorrow, cancer-man? -Sure, sure. Come on. l think that if l had more time, l would make a movie that ends with husband and wife leaving a pub, walking in the darkness to nowhere, he puts his arm on her shoulder as a sign of reconciliation and resignation and they continue walking into the night. The end. Daliah, Do you recall telling me about Eli fooling his wife with the cancer? Yes. She just explained it to me. l'm such a dope, ten months l meet him nightly, blind date him, listening to all this nonsense about blood counts and cells and accountants and God-knows-what. He bought me with all that talk, all the ''fax the beach to me''. Has anyone ever spoken to you like that? Ever told you ''fax the beach to me''? Huh? l'm in love with him like a little girl. And then l find out that l just happen to pass through his life, just happen to... What a son of a bitch... Three hours a night, quickie, quickie, coming and going. Now he goes and leaves me like... Like this stupid note... Crumpled. l feel like crying, you know... l need my mother, just to put my head down and cry. Like this. Forgive me... l don't know what got into me. That's not like me. That liar, playing around every night between my... arms. l once saw, years ago, a play at ''Habima'' theater. How did it end? Martha and George, sad, sad, sad. And He who sits above is gone, went to reserve duty. What, can't he see me? What have l done to him? Why do l deserve this? Czarniak, Be good to me, play something for me, play ''Right Here'', let's hear you. ''l walked and walked ''and wherever l went l didn't get anywhere ''l didn't get anywhere ''and l remain right here ''on this block with the piano and the coffee ''everyone passes through accidentally ''like a short story or a monologue in a play ''silence in this noise ''everyone is on edge ''waiting for something to happen ''in the time that's running out ''between the beauty of the block and the coffee ''and whatever is to come ''whatever is to come ''nothing's going to happen ''and whatever is to come ''whatever is to come ''nothing's going to happen.'' l have to run and develop the film. l'll return and we'll talk and talk. -All right. Take care of yourself in the meantime, okay? -Fine. -Bye. Okay, we're closing. l have an exam at eight, can l go? Good luck. -Thank you. Hi, UN, Come here, sit with me. Come. Hi. l'm Daliah, like the flower. Flower. Daliah. l don't speak Hebrew. Ya. -Ya. My name is Ralf Olsen. And l serve in the special forces of the United Nations, ya? -Ya. Oh, Ralf, Ralf, l'm so sick and tired, Ralf. l have a boyfriend, Ralf, who returned to his wife and the cancer. And l have a shitty pub, that gets into fist fights with Benny, who is screwing a psycho behind my friend's back, and Daniela, she's going to snort America, because it's cheaper there. Leaving me with Sammy and Samir in an lntifada that makes fun of everything What happened? -She jumped down from above... She jumped from above. Do you know her? -No. l feel lonely, Ralf. l feel very lonely. You know, if you don't mind, l close the place, and you and me, we go home, l think we can have a good fuck. Huh? -Sure. -Sure... Sure. Piece of shit. She committed suicide, Vicky. Jumped out of the window, they just took her body away. What did you do to her? Couldn't you see she was mental? Did you fuck her brains out till she couldn't stand it anymore? You idiot! When did she ju... Oh, of course, while l was in the shower. Okay, what do you want from me? She looked all right, talked some nonsense, but... People are jumping in this city because of me. She told me she wasn't all right. She told me she wasn't all right. Hello, Rafi, it's Benny. Listen, tell Tzvi that l decided to go up north. Yes, yes, now, now. No, no, l'm here in the Barbie. Not moving. l won't move till someone comes to pick me up. Thank you. No. Okay, don't cry. Someone will come by later to pick up my belongings. How did you put it before? Zero is a huge number compared to the acts l put on. Bonfire songs, that's all l am. The pot-heads are coming. You thought we were done... Lets tear them apart. Damn! Take him out, Rambo, don't look so nonchalant! We'll make a mess out of everyone here, that for sure. -Look, a war! Good morning. Good morning to everyone. Fire.
