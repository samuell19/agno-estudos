It's really delicious. I'm very happy. After eating greasy food twice in a row I need a meal of rice Okay No problem I wish I could buy you guys something nice here But I don't have enough money. So I can't treat you to anything special Sorry I just want to eat a meal of rice without being too fancy I spent all the money I earned from my part-time job Yes, it can take up to a week here. It can be expensive. Hm. It's about $3,000, I'd estimate that much. We may only be able to eat these But we all have our own sleeping room So let's do our best Try to understand. Money is tight. I understand. Where did you get the money? Hmm. I've spent all my savings Thank you. Thank you for what? I should be thanking It's great that you're here. Still, I'm thankful Buying us meals and snacks Thanks Have you two always been this close? How long has it been? I'm not sure it counts as close But we get along well, don't we? I always respected him as my senior. - I see. - Hm I never knew you two had such a good relationship He's so shy. At school, he barely played with anyone. So how does he know people like you? He didn't even tell me. Can you believe that? We're very close, aren't we? Hm. Yes. You agreed to be in his movie and came all the way here. Just now she was very obedient to your instructions I was really surprised. She's really good to you, really. Thank you. It's nothing. I mean it! Thank you If I make a movie in the future, maybe you can... Of course! That would be great. - Really? - Really. Call me. Then I'll really hit it. - Great. As long as it fits my schedule I'm really happy to meet you. It's great! Yes. Are you cold? A little. Oh, really? It's very windy here. After eating a sandwich and cold milk, it's even colder. Yes. Can I ask a question? What made you decide to direct a film so suddenly? I'm curious. You have always insisted on acting rather than directing. I'm curious, too. Spend $3,000 of your own money It's for the honor Honor? What do you mean with Honor? I want the honor. That's what I want. Although I'm not sure I can get it So that's it. Doesn't everyone want it? It's either money or honor. I feel the same way. I'm not the kind of person who makes movies to make money I did not have the skills to do so either I just want to get the credit Through acting or directing Appreciation. I get scared easily and that's why I can't act anymore. I think I should continue to work hard on my acting So many things I was afraid to try... I want to do something for myself before it's too late. I'm curious how it will turn out I want to know if I still have creativity in me Okay, I understand. I envy you. You've made a lot of films. But I am now no longer shooting I think you did a great job. Really? Thank you You work for a film company now, don't you? That's just work. To make a film, I need to give up everything else and focus on it. Even so, it may not turn out well I need money now. You have more talent than you think Don't doubt yourself so much. You really have a gift. Oh, thank you. Hi there Hello - I'm changing towels. - Okay. I don't see anyone else. They went to the supermarket. - Supermarket? Yes.

He has a story about an actress in his head. Really? What's the story? Nothing. It just came to me one day. I'll figure it out. Sure. Keep thinking about it. But I like that idea. It's good. Why didn't you tell me? Because there was no decision at that time Felt very dead and dull Like copying other movies I don't want that. What's the point? Of course, I thought about it a little more. So we're not shooting today? Most probably not But maybe we can walk around Ok? We've seen it all here. Maybe we can go somewhere else? Where to? I don't know, I'll think about it. I'll go take a shower then. - Okay - Good I better have a cup of coffee. I'll have a smoke. You want to smoke? I'll leave them here. But you don't smoke, right?

It's cold, isn't it? Hmmm. That was a great stretch you did this morning. I saw you. You've seen it? Yeah, it's not something everyone does. I do stretching exercises every day. I need to. My back is not good Really? You did a great job from start to finish If I don't do it, my back hurts. I'll never be able to sleep on the floor Is that why you need a room with a bed? Yes, Sungmo lets me stay there. Sorry about the best room. You are an actress. You have every right to be in this room. I used to practice taekwondo. Really? Yes. They do this in Taekwondo... Stretching exercises. I learned it at that time How high is your rank? Third degree black belt. Three degrees? - Really? - That's the highest level I've ever reached.

But now it's enough? - You're really good. Wow! I'm going to go down there for a minute. - Down there? - Wait for me Really? Shall I go with you? No, no need. Wait here. Okay. Excuse me Excuse me, please. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you something. Hello Hi What would you like to ask? I saw you working here from above. I'm curious how you came to do this I'm just cleaning up the trash. I see. I'd like to know why you are doing that. Because there's too much garbage here, among the rocks. Someone should clean it up. Garbage among the stones? All full of cigarette butts and garbage All kinds of trash. You're right. It's a lot, indeed. Is that all you wanted to ask? Do you do this every day? How often? Not very often, maybe twice a week? Come by, if you have time for a walk I live nearby That's great! You are great! I'm just cleaning up. You're really good. It's not easy to do this kind of thing I'm not doing this to get praise, but thank you. Okay So can I continue cleaning now? Of course. Thank you. Why are you walking so fast? There are a lot of restaurants here, right? - You can see it everywhere - Yes Are you guys hungry? Want to buy some sashimi? Sashimi? That's good. I like sashimi. How about buying some on the way home? Good idea. On the beach, we should eat raw fish! You're right. How about buying it and eat it in the room? - Good. - That's better. It would be nice if it was just us. Finally, sashimi! Do you like it too? Of course, I like it. - Great! - Yes. I can't drink shōchū, but it's really good with raw fish. They really go well together They do match, don't they? You want me to hold it? Drink from my cup I'll drink my own - Why all of a sudden? - You're not drinking? Okay, I'll just try. I like that tradition, you know. I want us to try it together We should drink it normally, it is more comfortable. Cheers - Cheers! - Cheers! Did you also hear strange noises late last night? - What? - Strange noises? I woke up to go to the bathroom And I was walking towards the kitchen when someone yelled behind me "Pull yourself together!" Really? Really? Didn't you hear? No. The voice came from right here, "Pull yourself together!" It wasn't one of you? Really? "Pull yourself together"? Yes, someone shouted at the top of their lungs It came from over there. Really? That's strange. I forgot to ask you guys this morning. You didn't ask, did you? Then I thought maybe it was a dream? But no, I must have heard it. I turned the corner, went to the bathroom, and then I heard it again "Pull yourself together!" "Pull yourself together!" Like this? No, the sound was much louder! It's weird, isn't it? Not one of you? Pull yourself together... I couldn't hear whose voice it was, it's been too loud. One of us? Not you? Me? Why would I shout loudly in the night? But you snore too loud, even in my room I can hear it. You sound like a tank. Did you hear that? I do snore. I get it... I thought it was one of you. It's really too loud. I have absolutely no idea. People usually don't talk so loudly in their sleep. I was so shocked, I thought it was directed at me. You heard it right here? Not a dream? Of course, it's not a dream. The strangest thoughts came to my mind In that brief moment I thought one of you knew all my sins and shouted at me Scary. Do you want more? I think I have committed many sins At that moment, I was really anxious. I was too scared. But then I suddenly felt guilty It was really disturbing. What's going on? It's so strange. Really loud - Really? - Really? - It's weird, isn't it? - Yeah. What are you doing? Check out some stuff I'm glad Sungmo's in a better mood Now that he's made up his mind, there's no more frustration. You're right. But there's no script for tomorrow's shoot I'm a little worried about how things will turn out He said it was too easy, no need to write I'm really curious He should at least tell us something If he wants to start shooting tomorrow Feels interesting Why did you decide to help him shoot this? I've said it before, but I think I believe in him. His personality? Yeah, that's why I'm helping him. That's very kind of you. Going for a walk on the beach? Okay, good. Let's go. We should go check it out. Good. But since yesterday, the weather can be terrible at night. Are you scared? Yes, a little. I'm here. Don't worry. Sure. And you also know taekwondo Kick! How can I fight with ghosts using Taekwondo? You can't beat a ghost? No, that's not possible. Do you believe in ghosts? I don't know, but I'd like to see one someday. What? Why? Then I can know with certainty whether they exist or not Once I'll see a ghost, I'm sure of that. You mean that? I believe there is a world that we cannot see I need to see it for myself. So, at least one thing is certain That's good. Come out, you ghosts! I'll head-butt them. So your plan is to head-butt them? Sure, with my head, I'll kill them all. Hi What's up? Long time no see Yes, long time no see. Is it okay to talk? Are you currently abroad? I am now in Malaysia But what happened? Are you doing well? Yes, thank you. I have something to ask you. Can I talk to you? Sure, I'm having breakfast. I have one request What is it? I'm traveling now, making movies. I've come up with an idea, but I'd like to ask your permission. You're making a movie? Yes, I'm making a short film. But I need your help. What kind of help? Remember the song I wrote for you as a birthday present? The one you wrote? Right. You sang the song, accompanied by Jungwon. Of course, I remember. So you remember I'd like to use that song, if you don't mind. Really? That song? It was my birthday present. Yes, I know. I think I should ask for your permission before using it Would you mind? Use it. You wrote it. Really? Can I put your voice in there too? No problem. It's a good song. But it's sad. You write very well, and the lyrics are very good. Right Thank you very much. I'll put it to good use I'll do my best Hmm. Good luck with your movie. Take care. Thank you. You take care too. Of course, I wish you happiness. - Have fun! - Yes! - Good. Let's do it. - All right. Start shooting Shall we begin? Wait a minute. Shall we start? Just keep it fixed. Then I will let you out of the picture Okay, let's do it. Hmm. Cameras! Action! Cut! Cut! - Be careful - I will It's slippery here. Walk carefully! Better be careful. Are you ready? - I'll do whatever comes to my mind - Hmmm Just do it naturally Okay. Get started - Let's shoot! - Prepare Camera! Camera ready Action! Excuse me, if you don't mind... What is it? Do you mind if I ask a question? What do you want to ask? While I was sitting there I happened to see you at work. I was curious. That's it! Stop! Stop! It's best to keep your hood on Sorry, I'm a little hot! It's hot with the hood on. You didn't tell me. Sorry! It's okay, I didn't tell you. - I'll keep it on. - Okay. Let's do it again. Ready? Shall we start? Oh, and you have to say it louder. You can hardly be heard Okay, I'll speak louder! - Let's get started. - Ok! Let's get started. Ready! Cameras Cameras ready! Action! Excuse me Do you mind if I ask a question? What is it? Sorry, I was sitting up there earlier. And happen to see you at work I was suddenly a little curious What are you curious about? Why do you want to do this? I'm curious Me? What are you curious about? You think it's weird to pick up trash? Not at all. I was impressed. You rarely see this thing. Really? I'm just picking up trash and cleaning up the place. - Because I live nearby - I Understand I forgot my lines Sorry - Let's do it again. - Yes - We can leave right now. - Or should we take a look? Happy with the progress so far? Hmm. But I was wondering.. Maybe we should shoot again? Is it going to be difficult? No, I just want to know what you think. I think we should know I'm sorry. - Let's do it again. - Okay My thoughts... It's a little blurry, so I was going to tell you about it as I shot it. But to explain, it is because of the people up there, the visitors I wanted to shoot them for a long time Then we shoot the woman below who's cleaning up the garbage alone Hm. Tourists having fun in their own world And that woman picking up trash by herself I saw that and the emotions hit me, so I went down and interviewed her. - You want to show the contrast? - That's right. The people above are distracted They get caught up in the illusion of life And at the bottom of the cliff a woman Cleaning the by-products floating downstream without any return So the person caught in the middle of them sees the woman, feels very touched and comes down He wants to spend time with her After seeing her up close, he likes her even more. The woman who cleans up the by-products That's very good. Yes. But the man does not want to go up again After meeting her, he wants to stay with her. So he starts following her She might be annoyed But he follows her closely At first, the woman is very friendly to him But after that, she becomes more and more distant Later, she becomes completely indifferent to him So he can't follow her around anymore He's left alone, watching the woman disappear. Now he can't go back up. But he can't follow her either So he goes to the beach I get it. It all makes sense. I don't know When this man walked into the sea, he was trying to die. Really? Actually, I do feel that way. I've never asked to be born I have to fight to get things done. People can only live once But I don't know why life has to be so hard I have written some music about this Really? Music? It's a song I wrote. But I wanted to use it in a movie When I walk into the sea, I'll play it by the camera. Mixing with the sound of the waves Do you have music now? Yes, it's on my phone. We can play it on the speakers - Sounds good. - It is! Let's finish it properly Hmm. Anyway, I want to finish shooting today. Do you have a hangover? No, I'm perfectly fine. - I have a headache. - Really? Let's do our best. - Let's do what we can - Hmmm - We have to shoot well - I'd like to Thank you Action! Are you ready? Hm. Let's start! Camera!
