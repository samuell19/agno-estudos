Brother Visitor, welcome to the school. Thank you. How was your trip? Not too bad. Always a pleasure to visit your lovely part of the country. Indeed. DECEMBER 1948 Oh! Brother Cyprien! -Hello. Meet Brother Roséa. How are you? Very well. What have you prepared for us? It's a surprise. Brother Jean kept it a secret. Sit in the middle. -Thank you. The place of honour. Meeting! Meeting! Come here! Everyone here is afraid. That's normal. It's called stage fright. Even Chouinard is afraid. Me? I ain't scared! Alright, so Chouinard isn't afraid, but he's an exception. Before going onstage, all actors have stage fright. All of them! And you know what? That's why they're so good. Courage... True courage isn't about not being afraid. True courage is being afraid and going ahead anyway. Everyone. Are we afraid? -Yes. Are we going ahead anyway? -Yes! Stand up! Let's go, Indians! Mr. Dubé, are you still afraid? Good. Stay like that. Lights. -Alright. I'm afraid, but I'm going ahead. I'm afraid, but I'm going ahead. I'm afraid, but I'm going ahead. You're on! Akanaka! Akanaka! Akanaka! A boat is approaching the coast! -Iroquois? No, great chief! Their hair is yellow like wheat and their boat has a monster head. Leif! What is this land that stands before us? I do not know it, but it is not Greenland. The wind tossed us far to the west. Let us set course for that deep bay where we can berth. Go explore the area. Leif! Wild wheat! Everywhere on the lowlands! The hills are covered in wine grapes. I, Leif Erikson, discoverer of this new-found land, will call it Vinland. Mr. Chouinard! -Land of vines and grapes. You're on! Uh, yes, it is I, Leif Erikson himself, who discovered this new land. Greetings, people! My name is Cristofo Colombo. I was born in Genoa, Italy, in 1451. Perhaps you know me better as Christopher Columbus, the discoverer of America. How dare you declare yourself the discoverer of America? I, Leif Erikson, discovered it 500 years before you. Lies! -The truth! Bald-faced lie! I won't allow a barbarian to steal my discovery. You're the thief. Leave before I cut you to pieces! Come back! Here it is. The true story. It's here, in these sagas. VIKING SAGAS It's a gift from the past. I leave it to you. Brother Visitor. You may sit down, Brother Jean. Your play was a great success. It wasn't only my play. Your pupils showed great gumption. They were perfect, despite the mishaps. Which you cleverly rectified. Your portrayal of Christopher Columbus was... very entertaining. It was improvised. I expect so. But... the script wasn't improvised. It's surprising, however, that our textbooks say that Christopher Columbus discovered America. And we long taught that the sun revolved around the earth. I must say that when I left Quebec City this afternoon, I did not expect to watch a pagan spectacle, devoid of moral value. I should have recalled that with you, it's always one surprise after another. Should I take that as a compliment? I'm told that Viking stories are a large part of your class. When I walk into the classroom in the morning, I see a lot of boys who want to be somewhere else. So I try to take them there on occasion. Learning should not be about amusement. A teacher should show students how to put in the effort. That's true. But it's also to infect them. With the desire to learn. Once they have that, they put in the effort. Our pupils are the workers and farmers of tomorrow. Our job is to teach them to read, write and add. I'm well aware of that. We're here to prepare them for adulthood by instilling in them Christian values. It's not by putting frivolous ideas in their heads that we'll do that. They're not frivolous ideas. Researchers speculate Vikings sailed the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Brother Jean... Let's leave learned speculations to the researchers. Our task lies elsewhere. If we don't ensure Christian values are maintained, who will? We hear things at the theatre and on the radio that would have been unimaginable in the past. And what happens when morals decay? Societies break down. Those are the matters that concern me, Brother Jean. I understand. -Very glad to hear you say it. I know that the Brother Director and Brother Cyprien share my way of thinking. Since I have several hours to travel, Brother Jean... Brother Cyprien, I wish you a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Thank you for everything, Brother Visitor. You have a talent for getting noticed. Do you like teaching here? See that it stays that way. Émile, bottom drawer. Come on. -What? Did you look at it? You'll look like a rag picker. Hand me the one you got for your birthday. You'll see, you'll get used to it. You'll make new friends. We'll write each other often and share our news. It's what your father would have wanted. Dad would never have sent me to boarding school. I'm doing this for you, Émile, not for me. If you don't understand now, you will later. Now get some sleep. We have an early start. Hello! JANUARY 1949 You won't get another chance like this. Promise you'll try your hardest to make it work. Say you promise. I promise. Alright... We'll drop this off on the way. I'll write you! So he goes, "Stop talking back!" So I shut my trap. But he didn't like that either. He goes, "Nothing to say for yourself, Mr. Chouinard?" I almost said, "Make up your mind, Fishface, do I answer or not?" You almost said or...? -Yeah. So you gave in. Looking for a fight? -You scared? He told you. -Yeah, yeah. Who's Fishface? Brother Cyprien. You'll meet him soon enough. Hey, don't we take baths here? No, just hand showers. Are you nuts? -Go for it, Chouinard! Lulu's here! What's going on here? He didn't know how the sinks worked, but now he does. No messing around, understood? -Understood, Brother Lucien. Making trouble already, new kid? No. -"No, Brother Lucien." Understood? -No, Brother Lucien. I mean, yes, Brother Lucien, understood. I wasn't scared. I swear! That's not allowed here. If you get caught, you're done for. Can I see it? Where'd you get it? My dad. Chapter 2: Having a humble image of self. Every man naturally desires knowledge. But what good is knowledge without fear of God? Shun too great a desire for knowledge for in it there is much fretting and delusion. Scholars delight in passing for clever. The more you know, the more harshly you'll be judged if it does not lead to a more saintly life. The arts and sciences you possess should not be a source of vanity. Mr. Chouinard. You've outdone yourself this time. I mean, did you see the trajectory of this aircraft? A perfectly straight line. An admirably stable altitude. He understands that to keep a plane at a certain altitude, its lift must equal its weight. Had he used a larger sheet of paper, his plane would have been heavier. He would have needed a wider wingspan to fly like that. To make sure everyone understands the way it works, you will write a composition on how to make paper fly. It shouldn't be too hard. Science will have the answers. 1,000 words should be enough. Take your seats. Now that that matter is settled, I'd like to welcome your new classmate, Émile Lacombe from Quebec City. Let's tell him what we've learned in the last months. So... Nothing? Yes, Mr. Bergeron? About North American explorers? -Very good. What about these explorers? -Christopher Columbus's travels. Magellan, Cortés, Cabot. Very, very good. Yes? -They often got lost. One thought he was in China, but he was in Newfoundland. What was his name? -Jacques Cartier. No, it was Cabot, Giovanni Caboto, an Italian. What was Cartier looking for in the Gulf of St. Lawrence? Yes, Mr. Bergeron? -A passage to India. A passage to India, exactly. You can't get more wrong. Mr. Dubé? We also learned the Vikings arrived well before them. Yes, Mr. Bergeron? Erik the Red left Norway because he was accused of murder. Mr. Lacombe. Any questions? -No, it's fine. You'll see, the more you learn, the more questions you'll have. It seems as though the strike... Hey, mail boy! Come here! ...asbestos and other major mines. In Thetford Mines... You look like you did something wrong but don't know what. Negotiations between the union and company representatives... This one's for Brother Gonzague and this one for Brother Jean. Don't look like that. For you. ...a political and economic alliance to thwart... From the university. Pull out Émile Lacombe's file, please. The university in Quebec City. L as in Lacombe. ...as the mood is heated. Premier Maurice Duplessis announced that he would not tolerate an illegal strike and would... Have you heard news of your brother? His wife is worried. He's involved, he's never home. There's bound to be trouble. The Archbishop of Montreal, Monsignor Joseph Charbonneau... You've got some reading to do. Thank you, Brother Lucien. ...if the strike were to begin. Monsignor Charbonneau declared that it was his duty... Mr. Lacombe. Did you enjoy doing this assignment? It was OK. -In your opinion, is copying word for word from an encyclopedia valid? Why exactly did you come to this school, Mr. Lacombe? Because if you're just putting in the time, the next few years will be tiresome for you. I won't even be here next year. When I turn 14, my uncle will get me in at the paper mill. My mom works hard and still we can't manage. THE FISH FACE BROTHER JEAN THE PEACOCK It's good you want to help your mother. But you're here till June. Not at a paper mill. You deserve zero. But I'll pretend you didn't hand it in. Start from the beginning, look at more than one source and make an effort to understand what you read. Write it in your own words. You have three days. There's a space for you in the Vinland Club. Tomorrow, 10 a.m. Try to be there. The university approached you? -Yes, the history department. They're organizing a symposium on the pre-Columbian period. And they invited you, just like that? Prof. Thompson from the University of Baltimore put my name in. Who will be there? Professors, students, guests from all over. It's quite prestigious. What exactly will you talk about? My theory on Viking settlements along the St. Lawrence. You don't seem convinced. They're used to hosting academics. Not mere teaching brothers. -Great. It'll make for a change. What will you do about the Brother Visitor's warning? He was concerned about Vikings in my class, not my free time. But you're taking pupils. -Only the Vinland Club. And since it's a Saturday, they won't miss class. And why do the boys need to come with you? They've never set foot in a university. I want them to know it exists and boys like them can go there. Most of them will never get another chance. Brother Cyprien! I'm sorry to shout at you. Have you spoken to the Brother Director? Unfortunately, it won't work. Your brother isn't sick. He's not on his deathbed. He's on strike. My sister-in-law needs help. They have six children. I understand. But this is not force majeure. We can't authorize it. Sorry. "They hoisted the sail. They sailed past fine beaches and a point. When they arrived at Straumfjord..." That's the Strait of Belle Isle, which you know. "They headed southwest, hugging the coast." This is where the new translation is fascinating. It gives us two very precise pieces of information: a direction, southwest, and the fact that they hugged the shore. It starts at 10:00. -Sorry. Sooorry. You underestimate the virtue of silence, Mr. Chouinard. As I was saying, the new translation mentions that they sailed southwest, hugging the shore. Starting from here, at the Strait of Belle Isle, there is one trajectory that matches the description. The North Shore. The North Shore? -Yes. But afterward? Where did they stop? That's less clear. But the new text gives us a precise description of where they stopped. "They sailed for a long time to the estuary of a great river. There were tall sand banks that prevented boats from entering except at high tide. Far off on the river, they saw a high waterfall flowing into a small lake." They talk of a tributary that narrowed to a bottleneck, then widened to form a kind of lake into which the river flowed over a high waterfall. You see? It's very specific. I reviewed all the confluences on the North Shore, and one exactly matches the description in the saga. Here. Our school is here. Really? You think Vinland could be there? I don't know. But one thing's for certain. We're going to find out. We need to practice removing earth one thin layer at a time. An object buried for centuries is fragile and easily broken. What are we looking for again? A nail. You should've hidden quarters. We'd find them faster. The Viking artifacts found in Denmark and Iceland were tools, buckles and cooking utensils. Like a toaster? My old prof in the U.S. will send us a real Viking artifact. You'll see what it looks like. What do we win if we find it? If you find the nail, you can keep it, Lacombe. Take your trowel and go gently. Wow! Are you serious? The other day, my cousin and I were skipping stones. And he threw a rock at me on purpose. Quick! -Pass the puck! Good job! He's behind the line! Block him! Over here! Here! Pass the puck here! Skate! Over here! Pass! Pass! Come on, it's my turn! Come on! Whoops! Sooory! Over here! Pass! Pass! Pass! Pass! I can do it! I can do it! I can do it! Well played, boys! Don't worry about it, Mr. Dubé! Hey, didn't your dad teach you to skate? Hey! Let him go! I said let him go! You're crazy! -What's your problem, Émile? Émile! There was a fox. It took off. It might come back. We could wait for it if you want. Show me. Let me see. Try not to get caught with this. I don't think it'll come back. Mrs. Lacombe? Sorry, the train was late. Please sit down. Your son did something unacceptable. It's unfortunate, but in the circumstances, he'll have to leave the school. Can't you give him a chance? Just one? He injured one of our brothers. And he showed no remorse. We must think how his behaviour could affect other pupils. Of course. Thank you for trying. I'm sorry, it's just that I can't manage. Sorry? He's a good boy, you see. He just keeps everything inside. I've tried everything to help him. Being kinder, stricter, studying with him, punishing him, but nothing works. Since we moved to Quebec City, he wants to work to help me out. I just wanted him to stay in school as long as possible. Longer than his father. Longer than me. I was hoping it would work out here. Mrs. Lacombe. Could you wait outside? Yes. He's been to four schools in three years, all in vain. You heard her. She tried everything. Perhaps no one's found a way to talk to him. Perhaps there isn't one. Give me a month. I've never lost a pupil and I never will. One month. The Brother Director wants to speak to you. You'll be here till June. Once it's summer, you can do what you like. You're a smart boy, Émile. And talented. Those are gifts. Don't waste them. Take your seats. Question: Who's heard of the miners' strike in Asbestos? Very good. You have an hour to read what the paper wrote about it. Great! I'll take the comics. Take notes, there will be a debate afterwards. ASBESTOS GENERAL STRIKE So many of them have died in the last few years. The families end up in the street. Our wages are so low, the government puts signs at the U.S. border announcing that Quebec labour is the cheapest in North America. That's why companies come here and give you jobs. We'll give you 5 cents, no more. This is a joke. We'll ask the president of Johns-Manville what he thinks. Uh, well... As we said, we can't... What's happening is a scandal! Our guys are getting beaten by the police. You think you're strong with Prime Minister Duplessis and the Catholic Church behind you! May I remind you that Monsignor Charbonneau, Archbishop of Montreal, who is present here, has given his support to the miners! He even asked his parishioners to send food. And clothes! The boys aren't mature enough to understand this complex issue. Does he want them to turn them against their future employers? It's true that his methods aren't very orthodox. But they've always worked. And I'm worried about his influence over Brother Mathieu. You should have seen him on his high horse, so angry. Brother Mathieu has a good head on his shoulders. He can think for himself. When we find an artifact, it's like communicating with the past. That object has been asleep for centuries, sometimes even millennia. But when we wake it up, if we can listen to it, we learn a lot about its time and the people who used it. What did they find? You'll soon find out. Is that you, Brother Jean? -It is. What did you find? An arrowhead. How long were they? Are they Iroquois? -Hey, Chouinard! Do you think that could kill someone? Did you also find the bow? -No. Just the arrowhead. Because it's made of stone. I refused his request, and adamantly, but still he went ahead. He informed us... Informed us, imagine! He informed us that he'd be back in a week. More of Brother Jean's influence. You refused his request? -Absolutely. You didn't think to ask my opinion? It seemed clear, Brother Director. I didn't want to bother you. Alright, thank you, Brother Cyprien. I'll have a word with him when he gets back. What? Hang on! Look at that! -I'm way stronger than you. Hey! I lost my snowball. Hang on to it better next time. Watch this! I'll throw it higher and farther than you. Brother Jean? Can I see how it works? -Of course. You look through here. -OK. And you press this button to start. This button. Like this? -That's it. Look over here! Look over here! Look over here! Émile! Film me! Film me! Come on, Lacombe! I'm filming you! -Film me! Did you see my throw? It was a great throw! Were you watching me? Marlborough's off to war Mironton mironton mirontaine Marlborough's off to war Who knows when he'll be back Who knows when he'll be back Who knows when he'll be back He'll be back for Easter Mironton mironton mirontaine He'll be back for Easter Or else for Trinity Or else for Trinity Or else for Trinity It's here. Can anyone describe the landscape? Well, there's water and rocks. Anyone else? I see... Mr. Bergeron, let Mr. Lacombe speak, please. There's a waterfall. Nice one, Lacombe. Shut up, Chouinard. The waterfall flows into a kind of lake. Then the lake narrows. Then it widens before flowing into the river. The Vikings! This is where they came! -The Vikings! In the estuary, there's a creek sheltered from the wind and northern waves. It's a natural shelter for boats. The creek was long used by local residents. The Vikings would have had plenty of room to anchor their boats, or knorrs, near their encampment. Is that where we'll dig? Later on when the snow melts, absolutely. We're going to dig there! -Right over there! Tell me, how is your brother? Fine. It's tense on the picket line, but he's holding up. Your sister-in-law? -Managing. With no income and six children, she does her best. She's lucky to have neighbours who help. Look, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have left... Normally, I would write a report. I understand. Since it's a major infringement of your vows of obedience, the Brother Visitor always receives a copy. Another possibility is putting a note in your file. But when the congregation wants to grant you your final vows, it could work against you. The third option is that at your next obedience, I recommend transferring you to another school. Brother Director, I... But... since it's your first offence, I won't do any of that. That's all. That's all? -That's all. I won't keep you any longer. Thank you. Thank you very much. Brother Mathieu. In future, as long as I'm here, if you need to ask permission, you come to me. Understood? -Understood. Brother Director. He still needs to discover the virtues of silence. But in my experience... I'm practicing to get better. What's your favourite part of school? Um, well, the weekend, I think. Brother Jean. -Hello. Practice your framing during the break. But if he lost or broke it, I could never reimburse you. I trust your son, Mrs. Lacombe. And it's mine, not the school's. Don't worry about it. What do we say? -Thank you! I'll be right back. Hi. -Hi. I don't know how to thank you. I'm so happy! He hasn't been like this since his father died. It's all thanks to you. That's kind of you, but Émile's the one who decided to put in the work. I'm so proud of him. He really misses his father. It's never easy. Have you thought of remarrying? Isn't that funny. The parish priest always asks me the same thing. He says at my age, I should have more children and do my duty to the nation. Do you think so too? I'm more concerned about paying my rent than looking for a suitor. Look, I... I'm sorry, I didn't mean... I just thought, with a man around the house... For Émile. It wasn't my intention... Once again, forgive me. It's alright, I know you didn't mean anything by it. We have to get going if we're to make our 5:00 train. Émile! My mom's calling. Happy Easter. -Happy Easter. See you Tuesday! -Goodbye. What a nice camera. Let's go, Mr. Dubé. It's all very well to study openings. But you only improve by playing against real players. I haven't played in years. But don't get too excited. It's like riding a bike. Hello, Brother Jean. -Hello, boys. Let's go. Hello. We'll be back in time for dinner. Try to make sure no one embarrasses us. They're a good group. Everything will go fine. Quebec City! Quebec City! Quebec City... Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? Going to Quebec City Going to Quebec City Ding ding dong Ding ding dong Brother Jean Brother Jean Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? Going to Quebec City Going to Quebec City Ding ding dong Ding ding dong Brother Jean Brother Jean Are you sleeping? Are you sleeping? Going to Quebec City Going to Quebec City Ding ding dong Ding ding dong Those who were here yesterday had the pleasure of hearing Prof. James Thompson from the University of Baltimore anthropology department deliver a talk on the likely encounter between the tribes of Baffin Island and Scandinavian explorers at the turn of the millennium. A fascinating presentation. Today we'll have the pleasure of hearing from a former student of Prof. Thompson, our own Brother Jean Picard from the St. Antoine de Charlevoix school. For years, Brother Picard has taken an interest in a potential Viking settlement along the St. Lawrence. Today he will talk to us about the various theories on the highly controversial matter of Vinland. I'll mainly be talking about my theory on the matter. Well, that's wonderful. Then Brother Picard, I'll pass you the lectern. Thank you. Director, members of the faculty, Dr. Thompson, students... Researchers have pointed out that the harsh climate of the Gulf of St. Lawrence does not correspond to that of Vinland as described in the Icelandic sagas. They do speak of a relatively mild winter, but especially of the grapes that gave Vinland its name, "land of wine." But what if they'd gone farther west? Remember that in 1535, Jacques Cartier named Île d'Orléans "Bacchus Island" in reference to its many wild grapevines. May I present vitis riparia, the riverbank grape. It bears a strong resemblance to grapes cultivated for wine. But it is much hardier and grows abundantly all along the St. Lawrence. By taking the direction and duration of their journey from Greenland, where the Vikings had settled, I deduce that they first sailed down the coast of Labrador before venturing into the Gulf of St. Lawrence, then into the estuary, following the North Shore. The saga mentions a southwest direction, then straight west, Sept-Îles, Baie Comeau and farther west until they found a settlement site. They then speak of majestic salmon rivers, meetings and trade with the Indians and even a deadly attack. Certainly, to this day, all archeologists have failed to locate Vinland. But we could look for 50, 100 years and never find anything if we look in the wrong place. But if we look in the right place, who knows what we could find? Thank you for your welcome and your interest. Thank you, Brother Picard. I'm sure this lecture will raise many questions. Mr. Grégoire. I just want to congratulate you. It's inspiring to see people undertake such research outside of the usual channels, so thank you. Until a university, yours perhaps, takes an interest in archeology, we manage as best we can. Professor Dubois. Thank you, Director. And thank you, Brother Picard, for the inspired demonstration. But if I understand correctly, your hypothesis is based mainly on stories passed down orally for many centuries until someone finally wrote them down as tales in a language that no longer exists. Allow me to rectify, Professor. Most researchers recognize the texts' historic value. Then why is it that researchers contradict each other by situating Vinland near the Strait of Belle Isle, on the Atlantic coast or even in the American Midwest? As I explained, it all depends on the interpretation of the descriptions in the texts. Of course. What's more, I'm sure you're aware that at the turn of the century, a Harvard professor by the name of Eben Norton Horsford also went to great interpretive lengths to prove that Vinland was located right next door, in Cambridge. You'll agree that was rather convenient for him. Yes, I know Horsford's work well. When he began digging, the fellow found stones several centuries old, old enough to convince him they came from the home of Leif Erikson himself. And to fully convince himself, he had a statue of Erikson erected in Boston. Now all of these lovely discoveries were based on nothing but pure speculation. To the point where no one takes them seriously anymore. You see, Brother Picard, Prof. Horsford wasn't an archeologist. No, he was a chemistry professor. Mostly famous for his development of the formula for baking powder. Like you, he was motivated by, how shall I put it... ...eclectic interests. In his defence, 19th-century researchers didn't have the writings we have today. The latest translations... -Regardless. Some researchers, alas, have the unfortunate habit of falling in love with their hypotheses. Hence, they lose all objectivity and stubbornly seek to prove that they're right. That said, perhaps you're not familiar with the phenomenon since, after all, you're not really a researcher. I'm glad you're taking it so well. As I understand, you're no longer satisfied with re-writing history books, Brother Jean. You're now trying to imitate Brother Marie-Victorin by strutting around the university. In all humility, Brother Visitor, I would never... Humility, Brother Jean? I'm very happy to hear you say that word. However, I'm not convinced that you grasp its true meaning. Out of humility, our community set itself the task of educating working-class boys. And we're proud of that. Our schools may lack the lustre of classical colleges, but our reputation is important to us. And I will never, ever accept that we be ridiculed because a vain Brother acts like a fool at the university. These boys will leave here to go work on farms and in factories. They'll never go to university. And you get their hopes up. You're preparing them for bitter disappointment. You're setting them up for failure. Brother Director, I want no more mention of Vikings here, is that clear? Trust me. You will focus on religious instruction and the core subjects. Forget everything else. We want our boys to become responsible heads of families. Strong, proud men. Not disappointed dreamers. You are dismissed. I know it's hard. I can still see the boy who arrived here with his little yellow suitcase. Shy and worried. Eager to find out if it would suit him here. You've come a long way since then. You may not like hearing this, but... The Brother Visitor is right. Religious and moral values must guide the lives of people and communities. That's the core of the Gospel message. Have I ever claimed otherwise? We must sometimes remind ourselves of our duty. Our society is changing. It's worrisome. The Church is losing ground. Young people are turning away from religion. They're even talking about a "Refus Global." There are agitators and communists everywhere. It's a real threat. I perfectly understand your interest in history and science, Brother Jean. But we're in the province of Quebec, not in an American college. You're right, Brother Léon, our society is changing. However much we resist we can't change that. The entire world is changing. The Church may believe that it can turn back time. But the world will still change, with or without us. Are you saying the future is your Viking stories that happened 1,000 years ago? Being open to new ideas and science, yes, that's progress. Our boys need to know we believe that. Hold on there! We can't put any old nonsense in their heads. While young Anglophones are getting educated, we keep wasting our pupils' talent by taking them out of school at 14 to send them to farms, mines and factories! But they're no worse than the others. We need to tell them that knowing about the world will get them out of poverty. We need to tell them they're allowed to dream. Otherwise, what is our purpose? You've always been hard-headed. But after what happened, you should keep a low profile. Where were you? -Detention. What did you do? Fishface? He doesn't let up on you. What's that box? None of your business! He gives you presents? He doesn't give me nothing! Leave me alone! What does he want from you? Give me it! Give it! If Lulu shows up, we're all in shit. So shut your traps and go to bed. What is the purpose of thinking deeply if you are not humble? Noble speeches are not what makes a man just and saintly, but a pure life that gives thanks to God. It is but vanity to amass ephemeral riches. Vanity to follow the desires of the flesh. Vanity to aspire to honours and to want to rise up to the highest rank. "The snow lay thick on the road also," comma, "and on the fields," comma, "and on the fields," comma, "for the April sun sent... for the April sun..." Mr. Lacombe. What are you doing? Give me that. You know this is not allowed? You stay here. Everyone else, leave your dictation on my desk. The last one out closes the door. What are you up to? Émile, I'm talking to you! I trust you, let you keep your knife and this is what you do? You think you're special because you don't care about rules? You want to show off in front of the others? You never really believed it. What are you talking about? The Vinland Club! The dig! You keep telling us we should never give up. Your bosses tell you to stop and you say nothing. You just give it all up. I understand you're sad and frustrated. So am I. But should we sit down and cry? Destroy our desk with a knife? You'll have frustrations in life. Things don't always work out. You find it unfair. But you pull yourself together. You lift your head up and keep moving forward. There's no sense crying. You may go now. And who said we're stopping the digs? Close the door on the way out. A sweater's a good idea. Got everything you need? -Yeah. It's cool in the cave. -I have snacks. Hey, wait for me! Come on! Hurry! Across your chest, that's it. Are your shoelaces tied? It's very important. There are holes in the road. Are your water bottles full? There you are. Your bags seem empty. Mr. Bergeron, did you tie your shoelaces? Oh no, I forgot my water bottle. Here, take this. I'll get another one. Thanks. We're waiting for Mr. Lacombe. We'll head this way. Really? The trail to the cave is this way. I'm fed up. -Me too. Brother Jean, how much longer? We're almost there. There are mosquitoes. -Hurry. What's that? Isn't that the school truck? -Yeah. Where are we going? -I thought we were going... Get in, it's faster. Where are we going? Will we all fit? Change of plans. -Look at this, François. Watch it! -My legs were sore. Me too, I was sick of walking. Am I the only one who's excited? No, everyone is! But where are we going? To the cave. -Anyone got an idea? I have long legs. I don't have enough room. I can't move! There's no room. You can go back to the school and say you didn't feel well. I don't want to cause you problems. It's riskier for you. Perhaps. Let's go. Hold on tight! We're off! Yay, we're off! I made the quadrants yesterday. By digging here today, it's like we're planting our flag. Anyone who comes after will know we were the first ones to believe that the Vikings stopped in Charlevoix. After all the work we did, it's the least we can do. Come and get your tools. The rakes. -The saw. I want the square shovel. Thanks. -I want the small one. The heavy artillery. -Thanks, Mr. Bergeron. Thanks. You know the drill, three per square and get digging. Come on, Émile! -We'll be a team. At the end! -Turn left. Hurry! Coming. -Put your things in the corner. Should we start from the left or the right? Whichever. I'll bring you a sieve. Hey, Chouinard! Wanna come with us? OK. What do you want me to do? Uh, the left side? It's important not to go over it again. There's nothing in here. -Nothing in here. Nothing. Come in. Sorry to bother you with this, but... It's no bother, Brother Lucien. What's going on? I went to the shed to get some tools, but it's almost empty. The shovels, rakes, trowels... They're all gone. Plus the pickup is gone, and no one asked for it. You'll never guess what I found. What? I found mussels. Want some mussels? In the mud. Back to work in five minutes. -Yay! It feels like we only just stopped. We can't do this very often. And look how motivated they are. Can someone help me close my water bottle? Did you find anything? -Yeah, mussels. We should get going. Or we'll be late for dinner. Another half hour? Having a nice hike, I see. You're mixed up in this too? I can assure you that Brother Mathieu knew nothing about it. I organized it all. You will stop immediately and bring the boys back. Hey! Come here, quick! Brother Jean! Hurry! Where did you find this? I found it. It was right there. There. Here? -Yeah. It's a bronze buckle. The Vikings used them to attach their capes. It's incredible. You found it, Chouinard. -We found it. It's incredible. You must admit it's extraordinary. Everyone will benefit. The boys, the school and even the whole province! You disobeyed a direct order from the Brother Visitor. Don't expect his compliments. -He's an intelligent man. He'll realize it will benefit the congregation. We can't sit on something like this. People have to know! What's so funny? The Brother Visitor's face when he finds out what we found. Nice framing, Mr. Lacombe. -Thanks. Look at Brother Jean! He's wondering what's going on. That's me! What a find! Stealing my spotlight, François? You worried? We look good, don't we? We do. I can't believe he filmed all this. Leif Erikson had already converted to Catholicism. Really? So he was a missionary? Exactly! The Norwegian king asked him to return to Greenland to convert the people there. So you, Brother Jean Picard, teacher in a small school in Charlevoix, think you have evidence that the Vikings came here to the St. Lawrence, near Malbaie. It's almost unbelievable. -It is! The mysterious Vinland described in the Icelandic sagas could well be located on our territory. Place it at a right angle, please. Very good. Don't forget the fact sheets. The drakkar! The centrepiece! Be very careful, it's fragile. Put it gently on the table here, please, gentlemen. Go get me a velvet cloth for the table, Mr. Chouinard. Mr. Lacombe. Do you have everything you need? -Yes, everything. Good. What are you doing here? Where are you going with that? Brother Cyprien wants to see it. -What? I told him what we did. Show me that. Does Brother Jean know? MODEL FOR THEATRE PLAY DECEMBER 1948 WORK AND HOME LIFE BRONZE VIKING BUCKLE Come on, honey. Ma'am, sir. May I introduce Mr. Chouinard, the first one to get his hands on the artifact. All year, Brother Jean showed us how to sweep and remove dirt layers, like archeologists. Please excuse me for a moment. A package from the U.S. It must have arrived two or three weeks ago. Yes, I got that. I gave it to the mail boy. Little Jérôme, your student. He didn't give it to you? Tell him! Tell him what you did with the package! I wanted to keep it for a bit. I'd have given it back. It's not his fault! It's mine. I'm the one who buried the buckle. What? I wanted to show you were right about Vinland. I didn't think it would go this far. Do you realize... You knew he would be here. You must have known what would happen. Why didn't you say anything? We were told to keep quiet. By whom? Come this way. It's right over here. I need to talk to you. Certainly, Brother Jean, with pleasure. The artifact was buried by some students. I heard about that. It's a real shame. When you found out, you kept them from telling me? The only one who could open your eyes was your friend Thompson. Don't you see the damage this will cause? The damage you caused. Take responsibility. Don't lecture me. You were vain and insolent. You never thought of the consequences for the school and the entire congregation. Yet you were warned. You must be proud of yourself. You wanted to put me in my place, and you did. But how will this benefit the pupils? It's a bit late to think about that, don't you think? For years, you've lorded over the school. For years, you've acted as if you're owed, as if you were better than everyone else. You have no humility, no respect for your vows of obedience. You deserve everything that's happening to you. And I'm glad. Stop that! Stop that! Stop it this instant! Mr. Dubé. Mr. Lacombe. Chouinard. Do you know what's going on? Pupils, brothers... I've brought you together at the request of Brother Jean, who has an important message to convey to you. Brothers... Pupils... I have some very bad news to announce. Yes... The Viking artifact is authentic. But it comes from Iceland. It was buried here by someone... ...who didn't realize what he was doing. It was you, Chouinard. It was you! Excuse me! Silence! This is in no way a witch hunt. The person knows the damage he did, and that's enough. Tomorrow we'll publicly set the record straight. I know you're disappointed. You went along with me in good faith. I'm guilty. Guilty of a lack of critical thinking. Guilty of lacking caution. And humility too. And I sincerely apologize for the hurt I've caused. Now... We need to look forward and draw lessons from this experience. Boys! Back to your dorms. That will be all. In silence. What you did had dire consequences. I thought about it and made a decision to expel you. You would be a distraction. This time it's definitive. But after discussing it with my colleagues, I'll allow him to take his year-end exams. Thank you, I appreciate it. That will be all, Mrs. Lacombe. I wish you good luck. Brother Jean, you will need to stay. Go pack your bags. Due to your lack of judgement, our congregation is the laughing stock of the province. We've even had reactions from Europe. As if that weren't enough, you felt entitled to attack one of your colleagues. You'll go to the Quebec City archives. You will leave today. Excuse me. Is Brother Jean still here? He was sent away. This was his last day at the school. Jérôme. I'm going ahead. I'm going ahead. I'm going ahead. Jérôme. Mr. Dubé! Mr. Chouinard. Mr. Dubé. Mr. Bergeron. Mr. Gamache. Mr. Dufour. Mr. Simard. Mr. Ouellet. Mr. Côté. Mr. Gagnon. Mr. Tremblay. Mr. Pichette. Mr. Harvey. I'm counting on you to stand up to Brother Cyprien. I'll do my best. I recognize that one. One doesn't meet many men like you in a lifetime. I don't know what will become of the school without you. Well... You know... No one is irreplaceable. That's not true. We only say that to console ourselves. Brother Jean? Someone to see you. Thank you. I'll be right there. She's not answering. Can you imagine how worried she must be? I don't deserve to have it. Don't be like that, Émile. Don't feel sorry for yourself. It will get you nowhere. Would you do me a favour? Keep it. And use it. Film. Film the people you love and the things that deserve to be remembered. I apologized. I'm proud of you. I have something to tell Brother Jean. OK. I'm going to stay in school. I'm going to take my exams. This fall, I'll start at another school. Won't you stay a bit? It's getting late. What will you do now? For now, I'm in charge of the archives. Afterwards I'll see. I enjoy the archives. They leave me alone. They don't tell me what to do, or not to do. It's so unfair. I'm not out on the street. I have a room, laundry and three meals a day. Many are worse off than me. You've done so much for Émile and you're paying the price. He did it to help me. I wish it could have gone on longer. The school. You. I'm not worried. I have faith in him. And he has a big advantage. You. You're brave, Marguerite. Whatever you do, I'm sure you'll find what you're looking for. Both of you. Please. Thank you for everything. I hope everything goes well for you. My thoughts will be with you. A package for you, Jean. Dear Brother Jean, Forgive me for calling you that. It's out of habit. Here is some footage I shot. I thought you'd enjoy it. I talk about you a lot to the archeology team here in Newfoundland. It's a shame you're not here. I wish they were lucky enough to meet you, the way I was lucky to know you. I will be eternally grateful to you. Best wishes, Émile. In 1961, two Norwegian archeologists discovered the foundations of a Viking settlement in L'Anse-aux-Meadows, northern Newfoundland. The dig lasted several years. While it is impossible to determine whether it is the Vinland described in the sagas, researchers all agree that it is the first European settlement in North America.
