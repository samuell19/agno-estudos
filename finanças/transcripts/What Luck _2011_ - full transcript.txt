Key jingle can be heard. Followed by car starting sound... Unknown voice [os] oh, man. Guitar strums, outdoor sounds. Voice [os] hi. I'm John. I live out in here in lovely barstow, ca. You know, some people call barstow the armpit of the world. That is so....Totally not the truth. More like the butthole. Well...it's not a butthole, it's an armpit. Or butt-arm-hole. They say there's only two ways you can get out of barstow... A] Death. And 2] Win the lotto. I think I'll go for #2. The year... well that's unimportant. Just know that it's Tuesday. I think it's Tuesday. Could be Thursday. Feels like a Thursday. Alright, we'll split the difference and say Wednesday. Anyway, job #7. Not quite as shitty as job #2... But it's a job. I feel like this might be the one. My girlfriend Holly, she disagrees. You know she does always talk to me about - how I should focus on something and get my life together. But she hasn't had seven jobs. So screw her. I'm gonna go down to main street and buy me a lotto ticket at the liquor store. That's what I'm talking about. I mean , you know if the statistics are right I'm in good shape cause they say every year the califlornia lottery generates over 3 billion mother- fucking dollars! But enough about me. That's Holly. The love of my life. Yeah, I really think she's the one. And she thinks that I have the potential to be the one. With a little work. Yeah, whatever. I'm due for an over- haul anyways...But, she is a little sassy though, I mean, c'mon look at her. I'd totally hit that. Well, I have hit that. I do hit that. Yeah, we been going through some rough patches lately... But who doesn't right? We'll get through it though I'm sure. I hope. I don't know...Then there's my best buddy Tim. Well, sort of my best buddy. I mean we've known each other forever. But he's been totally trying to swoop in on Holly. What the fuck right? So I was like dude, and he's like dude? Look, if she leaves you she's fair game. It's like hhmmm, I agree. I shouldn't have. I mean friends don't date friends ex-girlfriends, right? Isn't there some sort of bro code about that? I don't know what sucks more, that or walking to the bus stop. Just to go and borrow grandma's car... What luck. Yeah, what fucking luck. My mother always used to say - I have the luck of the Irish. And I always used to wonder... What luck? Shit. [Holly]: I'm hungry again, seriously. I think I might have a tapeworm. [Lance:] Yeah... [Lance:] I can see that. You eat like a horse. John [os] - Oh, speaking of douches , I almost forgot about this guy. Lance.... sir Lancelot. He's a thespian. Okay, right there that should be a sign that somethings... Just I don't know. She says "oh,we're just acting buddies." Yeah. Right. Acting. Fucking actors. Huh? Yeah, more like fuck buddies. I don't eat a lot - just frequently. Hmm,mmm. Although, I don't really have an appetite right now. Luckily you have the metabolism of a 14 year old. So does your mom.... Seriously, I can tell there is something wrong. What's up? Oh....I'm just...Really, annoyed with John. I don't know what to do, I don't know if I should call him back, or if I should make him wait it out...Because, he's clearly not making an effort for me. [Lance:] Uhmm....Duh. That is exactly what I've been saying the whole time. I mean he, doesn't ... spend time with you. He's always at one of his 6 jobs... [Holly:] Right. 5 that he's been fired from obviously, so, I mean... I don't know. You're just two different for him. I know, you think that it would be great though... Yeah, 'cause you're my girl. Hello!? [Holly:] Right. I mean but, he is pretty great. It's not that...It's all bad. You know there is a lot of good. That's why I want it to work. [Lance:] He does have really good hair. And soft hands. I still don't understand how you guys have sex though... I mean, he's got to be tiny, right? He is hung like a light switch, but there's more, uh.... I don't... I mean he's probably, really good with cunilinguous. Well, you've seen how big his mouth is... Hmmm, I just hope your pussy's not that big. My shit is tight. Thank you very much. [Lance:] I'll take your word for it. God knows everybody else has been down there. So... Tim 'Kay I'm almost ready. Hold on... hold on... [Holly:] Are you sure this is good? Cause the wind is kind of moving my hair into my face... [Tim:] The trailer is perfect. [Holly:] Okay. I just feel like I've got a lot of hair in my face... [Lance:] How about my hair? Is it good? Yeah, sure. Great, see. Right there, see. Perfect. Alright... Tim ready to go...Okay, okay. Set.... action. [Holly:] We're so close. [Tim:] Okay, good. Tim alright, I don't see your eyes. And... action! John [os] Good old Tim. Always wanted to be a "filmmaker". Yeah, right. Got to admire his tenacity and perserverance though... I mean, phew, wow. Which should make up for his lack of talent. It doesn't. [Tim:] Okay, keep it close. Ready, 3,2,1... Both shouting [Lance:] It's the new trailer! [Holly:] It's a new puppy! [Lance:] It's not a puppy, no. Hello. Hey, hello. You're... Right there. [Holly:] Oh, god. [Tim:] Pefect, cut! Cut! That was so perfect, I absolutely loved it! For the next scene we have up is the bedroom scene. You're gonna be... Are you sure this isn't some nc- 17 porno, because I did not sign up to do that. No, it's going to be a legitimate film. We've got pasties and everything. Pasties... I don't think John's gonna be okay with that... He's a 100% on board. We're doing this together. He wants me to make my film. We're in it to win it. Professional films dude? Is that even a real camera? Does it shoot film? Black and white equals art film big boy. Just be happy I didn't make you learn your lines in French. Now, I really gotta get going to my next job. Meet you at base camp. Okay, um...You forgot your camera. I gotta go get our next scene ready, so just, just work this out and get the camera for me. Get the camera for you? Are you kidding me? What a douche. Okay, I'm...Right. I'm gonna... We gotta bring the camera back? Oh, okay! I guess you gotta bring the camera back. What a dick. [Lance:] Me? I'm gonna... You're stronger than I am. Techno music plays. Techno music plays. John [voice over] This routine is so tired. Sucks. My balls. Everyday. Same thing. Get up. Go to work. Spend my last dollar on a lotto ticket - hoping that maybe it'll change my mundane existence... Store beep sound uh, can I have one lotto ticket please? Cashier yes, just one? Just one, yeah. Maybe it's your lucky day. Oh, yeah. I hope so. Alright, thank you very much. [Clerk:] You're welcome. Alright, you have a nice day. [Clerk:÷} You too. Buenos dias. [Clerk:÷} Hola, tardes. Buenos tardes. [Clerk:] Yes. John vo seems so mundane doesn't it? Life. Just repeating itself. Day in, day out. Day after mother- fucking day. Until you die. Sighs. Answering machine beeps: John, are you there John? It's just your mother, nobody important... You think you might call me once in awhile, normal kids call their mothers you know. You talk to Tim all the time. His mother Betty told me. How are you and Holly? She still around? Nevermind on getting back to me until you got friggin' fleas in your fluff. Then you'll tell me what you and Tim are up to. Machine ends. Beeps again. New voice. Holly's voice. John are you there? You better not be screening my calls. You're probably listening to records, that's alright. But when you get off work tomorrow at noon I'd really like to see you. [John mumbles:] Fuck.... You're gonna have to make a decision John. It's me or that stupid job of yours. I mean really, you're spending all your time at that stupid place or with your stupid records and not enough with me. This is getting really old, really fast. You need to decide John. It's either that burger joint, or me. If you want a second chance - don't forget our lunch date tomorrow. 3 pm. Do not be late. The phone hangs up with a loud click. [John:] C'mon lotto. John vo my therapist keeps asking me...Are you doing what you're doing today because you did it yesterday? Huh? Yep! Pretty much. Phone rings c'mon John, pick up. Pick up.

Stereo? Isn't it awesome? Holly...this is fucking great, man. I've been looking for this thing all over and every- where I go they seem to be out of it. [Holly:] Wow. Okay, wait. Wait, wait...Why you buying me a gift? Why, what do you mean? Why wouldn't I? I mean, I know... You're on like your 6th job in 3 months and, um, I really have a good feeling about this one. So I'm trying to do something nice for you... Uh, it's like the 7th...Job. What do you mean? Charlie fired me. Why? What happened? I don't wanna talk about it. But I got mine though... I locked him in the freezer. [Holly:] You did what? I locked him in the freezer. He deserved it. Oh my god... I mean I was feeling I was in the moment, kind of postal, and he just really rubbed me the wrong way, man. I did good shit for him. Well, what am I gonna do with you? I don't know. [Sighs] What am I gonna do about Lance, Holly, huh? [Holly:] What do you mean? Well, uh, I don't know, you guys are, you know, you're close, and you guys are always talking on the phone and you're like best buds and now you're shooting a movie together, and I just, it just makes me feel, I don't know... Insecure? [John:] No,no, no... I'm not insecure, it's just, I mean, look let's face it... Lance is uh, one of those model types who should be on the cover of one of those romance novels. He's kind of like a cross between a Tom Cruise and a fabio. So...Uh, you know excuse me if I can't imagine him slipping you the bone! What? [John:] Yeah. That's ridiculous. You're being a totally douche about this. No,no. I don't think I am. [Holly:] Yeah, I think you are. No I think you guys are playing hide the salami. [Holly:] Are you serious? Behind my back! You guys haven't you know...Done the old 2 step boogie? Nooo. [John:] He hasn't slipped you the salami? [Holly:] Oh, my god. I can't even believe you right now. You haven't opened up your mountain cabin for him? Ewww. God you know what, this was just a waste of time. I don't even know why I even bothered. I don't even know why I did any of this. You know what John, forget it. Holly...wait just... [Holly:] No. You're being an asshole. Holly.... Holly! C'mon babe... I uh....Check. Anybody? Guitar music plays with a harmonica... John vo: So, I'm just hoping, I win the lotto - my life will be good. My life will be simple. Yeah. And then, Holly will really love me. Not just for my looks. You know.

[John:] [Sighs] [John:] Alright, how about this... You let me borrow your car, you loan me 200 bucks... And the next time you call, case you want me to get you... Out of the clutches of the old ball and chain... I won't be such a douche. [Tim:] You're supposed to be doing that anyways... I thought you were my friend. [John:] Well, yeah, but you ask me to do it all the time... With no reciprocity. [Tim:] I live with her all the time. [John:] Yeah, well, not my problem. [Tim:] It's my problem, you're right, I'm the one who... Married her, she's my problem, this is Tim's problem, whatever. Point is, if I'm gonna loan you 200 bucks... The next time that I call to get me out... You're just gonna give me any shit, you're gonna say... "Okay Tim", you're gonna call back, so I can... Get the fuck out of there. Is it that hard?

I saw it as an opportunity to fuck with John. Oh god. Using my training gear. I'm sorry your what? My training gear, I'm moonlighting now at the pickled tuna. You know, extra money, free boners. [Holly starts laughing] Oh, good so you can stop trying to give me one then. Probably won't. Do that. I'm gonna just keep bothering you. Oh my head is killing me. Do you have anything I can take? Ah, if you were a guy I would offer you a blow job, but... Not really. [Holly:] How would that help my head? Release the stress. Is that Lance and Holly? Fuck! Fuck me, what the fuck? Fuck. Really not helping me with that... once again. Ah, that's kinda rude. Honking can be heard. So does he have a big dick? [Holly:] Excuse me? Lance. You know does he have a big dick? A kielbasa. A dripping yellow submarine!? Why don't you go fuck yourself? 'Cause that's the only action you're gonna get... Oh, really? Unlike you hoochie- mama Holly! Excuse me? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, I think you know what I mean. Giving free rides like a Tijuana whore! Ack, ack, ack, ack. Unh, unh, unh... Lance is gay. You insecure fuck. What? [Holly:] Penis envy much? You know what? Why don't you grow some hair? Grow some fucking balls. And next time you're in the shower don't forget to turn on the water cause you stink... He's gay.... but, aw...Fuck. John vo: Damnit. She's always right. I am going nowhere. Just wasting away in a dead end job, wasting my time, for what? How can I find the time to chase my dreams when it all goes... Into surviving. Day to day. I mean Holly might be an ass- hole sometimes, but goddmanit, I'm a dick and that's just the way I like her. I may not change my ways tomorrow or the next day, I may not change at all, but I can try to change. And I'll keep trying because as long as I have Holly, I have a reason to try. I have a reason to live. I mean, what luck? I'm fucking lucky to have Holly. Holly! Damn it, damn it John, what are you doing in here? I love you. [Holly:] You know what, we can't talk in here. [John:] I just... [Holly:] Let's go outside. You know, I love you to. But you've got to stop being such an apatethic loser stuck in mediocrity, okay? I know. [Holly:] You're better than that. I mean, all you do is work these dead end jobs, it's like you're waiting for a free hand out or some dead relative that you don't even have to die. You're not going to win the lottery. Okay John? You've got to be the one to make the change. I know. I just don't know how. You know? Don't know or haven't tried? Do or do not, right? Right. Do or do not. There is no try, see I taught you that remember? Hnnnh, look I have to get back in to work, but I'll walk you to your car. [John:] Alright. I love you Holly. [Holly:] I love you to John. John vo: That kiss - it was the same kiss we kissed everytime we made up. Her tongue wrapped around my blue puppet uvula, kissing like a horny fluffy teenager, oh god...But was it going to change anything? I mean was it gonna work this time? We have broken up more times than we've made up. I...I don't think it's gonna work this time. I mean, she's just not happy with who I am. Right? You heard it.
