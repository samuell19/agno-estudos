(SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull Every minute of the day, we have a free choice. Every one of us has a right to choose. Our choices affect the rest of our lives. Some of these choices are more important, and some are less. I believe wholeheartedly that all is foreseen, but freedom of choice is given. We all have endless possibilities within the lives we lead. I'm sure you think to yourself all that time, what if? What if I had proposed to my first girlfriend? What if I had moved to New York? When we step outside of our comfort zone, amazing things can happen to us. But what does it take in order for us to actually get out of our comfort zone? Good morning. I hope this is how you take your coffee. Did you eat anything today? No, but... coffee's a good start. Today's lunch is on me. I want you to take it. I've got to go. (RELAXED MUSIC) All right guys, I have got amazing news. Cleveland came back to win after being down three games to one. Nobody's ever done that before! We just made a ton of money. We don't have to work for like six months. The timing was perfect, 'cause I could really use a rest. It will be very good for my health. What? Don't you have anything to say? (SQUEAKING) Hi, I need to make an appointment with Dr. Adams. Three weeks? All right, what about the alternate? Okay, make an appointment with her. No, I need it as soon as possible. Can I get in today? No, it's okay, I'll just come in and wait. All right, thanks. WOMAN: So how late did you stay last night? Seven. I got it all done, though. Everything is covered for the meeting. Is it okay that we let them have the recipes? We can save all the recipes on a hard drive. We managed to keep up with our deadline. We're just waiting on a final call to set up the meeting for tomorrow. Well, all the recipes are done, and we'll just wait for them to sign the contract. I know you don't want to see him, but we're going to have to invite him to the meeting. I don't mind seeing him. He's still my best friend. You're the best. I'll call him right now. (GENTLE MUSIC) I will have you know that kids carry lots of diseases and viruses that they get from other kids at school. You bring home new germs every day. All right, I'm sorry. I'm just not used to being around children. I think it's very unhealthy. (COUGHING) Did you get all your shots? You're betting on the wrong team. This one? Yeah, they're gonna lose. Yeah, that's a lock. - No. - Look. Look at that. That's how much they made me last time. It's never gonna work. No, I'm not gonna bet against them. If you want to lose. All right. KID: There's no way. MAN: All right, I'll do it. KID: Hi, mom. Hey, sweetie. How was school today? KID: Good. Yeah? Is your cough any better today? I think so, I don't know. I hope so. Do you mind sticking around for one more patient? Okay, sure. I'm sorry. Mr. Wiley. Yeah. Hi, I'm Dr. Kareem. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. You too. I can take you in back if you're ready. I am ready. Right this way. Okay, deep breath in. Good. Again. Okay, one more time. Good. I know you. Right. No, really, we've met before. DOCTOR: Mm-hm. What? I'm not just trying to pick up on you. Well, not just trying to pick up on you. I'll figure it out. April and David's wedding. You're the sister, right? Yeah! Wow, small world! Yeah, David's a good friend of mine. Oh, okay, yeah. I'm sorry, I don't... I don't remember meeting you. Ah, that's just 'cause your brain's full of all that medical knowledge. That is true. Look, I'm not offended that you don't remember me, even though I did ask you to dance. I feel bad. I'm sorry. Oh, man, my heart rate. It's just beating like a mother! Well you're good! Yeah, all your results are normal. Do you think I need to start taking beta blockers? No! Besides, how do you even know about beta blockers? Well, I read. A lot. (GIGGLING) Well you have nothing to worry about. You're actually in really good health. You're fine. Come on, I'll walk you out. After you. Oh, thank you. (LAUGHING) (SAD MUSIC) Hi, April. How are you? APRIL: I'm fine. Come in please. Where is David? Oh, he's not here. I had the feeling you were gonna give me some bad news. Well... Your studies came back. And... unfortunately... they're not normal. Do you remember the miscarriage that you had? Because of it, there is extensive damage to your uterine wall, and you have a syndrome called Asherman syndrome, which make pregnancy very, very difficult. I'm sorry. Can I get you some water? What? Can I get you some water? Oh, um... Sure. I mean, I was starving. Starving! And yet I gave you the last apple even though I knew you just had a huge sandwich two hours before that. Oh, man, your stomach was growling. And you're like, "No, baby, you should eat it. "Don't worry, it's gonna go bad if you don't eat it." We really should have gotten a map for the road. How was I supposed to know we'd run out of gas in the middle of the desert? You're the man, you're supposed to take care of these things. I'm supposed to pack the meals, and you're supposed to take care of the road. God, I've missed you. How long this has been? 16 days. Still sure you want to file these papers? Look, I don't want to waste your time, okay? I'm not ready for kids. I respect your decision. I just think it's a huge mistake. You deserve someone who's gonna fulfill your needs. Okay, don't give me that face. What face? You're a face. Stop. - Thank you. - Okay, I'll cover my face. That's better. Listen, guys, it's very simple. We went over the details many times. All we have to do at this point is sign the contracts. What about paragraph 57? Can we revise it? I feel like Mrs. Rogan's recipes are not being protected. Do you have any other concerns other than that? Nope. No. All right, may we have the room? We need a few minutes. (TENSE MUSIC) Let them change 57. We just need them to sign the contract, revised or not. Come see this. They'll have no way to protect those recipes. I checked. All right. Okay. I want nothing to do with them. That's okay, I'll go tell them the deal is off. Do we need to find another factory now? Either another factory or another sponsor, but don't worry, we've got plenty of time for a solution. Oh my god! Four years of all that work, just gone. I could really use a drink right now. I actually really need to talk to you. You two grab a drink, and we'll figure something out tomorrow. All right, yes! Oh, hey, it's you! Hey, I won because of you! Check it out. How did you know? Next time, we go 50-50. Huh, we'll se about that. Believe me, I can use the money. All right, deal. So, uh, what'd your mom say? Are you contagious? Oh, oh, hey! (CHUCKLING) Mr. Wiley, how are you doing? I'm doing a little better, but I think I'm gonna have to set another appointment with you very soon. Oh, yeah, well, I can see that your pulse is racing fast again. Huh, right. (CHUCKLING) This thing. Mom, can we sit with him? Oh, honey, no, I don't want to bother Mr. Wiley. Wiley Oh, no, really, it's no problem at all. Please, have a seat. No, no, seriously. I mean, there's other tables open, and he still kinda has a cough, so we'll just sit over there, it's okay. Take care, Mr. Wiley. Thank you. So glad we got desert for later! Looks good, huh? (LAUGHING) We'll save it for when we get home. So, I've never seen you guys in here before. Do you eat here often? Yeah. I mean, we like the food. It's good. Yeah. Oh, honey! - Let me get you a kleenex. - Thank you. You're welcome. So, is your dad joining us for lunch today? (GIGGLING) You don't stand a chance with my mom. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) Looks like you're having a worse day than I am. I'm Steven, by the way. Nice to meet you, Steven. I'm Sharon. Did you have anything to eat today? No, but I've lost my appetite. That makes both of us. You want to talk about it? Something really unpleasant happened to me today. But I feel like... your troubles are bigger than mine. It's embarrassing to talk about. Well you seem like a good person, and... my troubles aside, you can talk about it if it'll make you feel better. (SIGHING) I just realized the people I was supposed to close a deal with were planning to steal from me. I didn't even see it coming. Nowhere. It's the end. But did they actually take anything? You saved yourself from these thieves. It's a pretty good day. I think I'm relieved. I don't even need to see my therapy. You know what? Let me give you something. Take this. You deserve it more than he does. I'm serious. You could use it. And you know, this more importantly, I want you to have my business card. It has my office number, my address. It's just right around the corner. Please don't hesitate if you need anything at all. Thank you. So you did well, huh? Yeah, I won big. Yeah, I'm on fire. And what's with this place, by the way? We never come here. Oh, well I ran in to Lisa once here, and I was kinda thinking she might show up. I'd really love to see her again. Well you know she's got a child, and you don't like kids. She's got the whole package. Yeah, but this kid's not like most kids. This kid's a freaking genius. No, he is, and he's really good at sports. Oh, that's important. It is to me. You know it's like my life. If only I could get her to go to dinner with me. Good luck with that. So what can you tell me about her? Speaking of which. All right, go time. Hey, Lisa! (CHUCKLING) It's you again. Yeah. I wanted to give you Holden's cut of the winnings. Oh, no, please, keep your money. Seriously, I just, I don't think it's that educational. All right, well at least let me buy you lunch. Oh, I'm actually in a hurry, but thank you. All right, well, how about you let me buy you dinner sometime next week then? (SIGHING) Come on, just think about it. Okay, I will think about it. All right. Well, David's here. Really? You should go talk to him. Yeah, he'll tell you what a great guy I am. Huh, I'm sure he will. (CHUCKLING) I mean, look at the two of us. We'd be perfect together. Young doctor and a hypochondriac. Come on. My mother would be so proud. (LAUGHING) I'm sure she would. Lisa. David! - Hi. - How are you? I'm good, how are you? I'm good. How is April? She's doing good. I miss her so much. I know, I'm sorry. You guys are both such amazing people, and I love you both. I know you're gonna work this out. Promise? Yes, just hang in there. (LAUGHING) Okay, I will talk to you next week. Yeah, great! Okay. I'll get your number from David? Yeah. Sounds good. Well one thing's for sure, my son sure likes you. He's a cool kid. He likes him too. I don't understand these instructions. It says identify cables and wires. Okay, honey, honey, it's okay. We'll read it again. Okay, all right. Don't be hard on yourself. All right. We'll get this. Do not install GFCI receptacle. Right. - Okay, so maybe the... - Hello? Hi, honey. Oh, Peaches! It's great to see you! Oh, great to see you too. I've missed you, kid. I've missed you too. (LAUGHING) Okay, I'm gonna put these groceries away. Oh, honey, don't forget your jacket. You left it here yesterday. I put it on the chair. APRIL: Okay. Okay. Okay, so, sweetheart, I think you need to maybe turn it the other direction. You think? Yeah, well why don't you try it. All right. The other direction. All right, that's good. All right, so now let's look at the picture. Is that the same? Maybe turn it... Well, no, the picture's like that. Peaches! You're home! What a surprise! I've missed you, kid. APRIL: I've missed you as well. You know, why don't... Why don't you look for another screwdriver? Maybe these are the wrong ones. Why don't you go check your toolbox and see if you can get a different one? Is Lisa coming as well? She should be stopping by some time this weekend. Ah, good. (SOFT MUSIC) How was your day? It's getting worse. He left food on the fire today. We have to get the caregiver in more often. I need help. It's not a problem, okay? I want you to be able to go to the grocery store and live a normal life. And don't worry about the money. I'm gonna take care of it. Thank you. I miss my grandson. And I know she's busy. I do, I know, but... You have to make time every now and then to see your parents, don't you? Isn't that... I know, but she's a single mother. She works all the time. She barely even gets to see Holden. She sends her love, and she misses you guys. I'm sure she'll stop by this weekend. That's what you said last weekend. Maybe we should check on dad, huh? Yeah, yeah. Dad? Good seeing you. Good seeing you too, honey. I'm gonna take care of the money, okay? Don't worry about it. Please. Please, don't tell Lisa. I won't. I won't say anything. Okay. - Bye. - Bye. See you tomorrow. Be careful driving home. I will. Are you all finished? (KNOCKING) Oh. Hi. Hey, good to see you. APRIL: Good to see you too. How are you doing with everything? Michael! MICHAEL: What's up, buddy? Lisa will be here in a minute. Oh, cool, sounds good. Come sit with us. You bring your laptop? Of course. I got something I gotta show you. All right. That. April, come look! We're gonna win again! Double up. Last week we won $7,000 from one game. Is that true? It sure is. So if I wanted to place a bet, what would I do? Well you just tell me how much you want to make, and my man here will make it happen. Mom thinks it's very un-educational. That's okay. It's our little secret. Hey, guys. I am so sorry I am late. Ugh! Got holed up at work. Hi! Did you get your homework done? - Mm-hm. - Yes? Good. Thank you. No worries. - For picking him up. - Of course. Where did you park your car? I didn't see it in the driveway. I sold it. What? Yeah, I got a great deal. April. You did not even tell me that you were thinking about selling your car. Don't worry about it. I needed the money, so I'll get another one. You guys have fun. Holden and I are gonna go. Come on, baby. Good to see you. Hi, yes. Sorry, I got held up at work. (LAUGHING) Don't worry about it. Hey, you look exhausted! Oh, yeah, thank you. Tell you what, why don't we just stay in and relax, and we could order some sushi? Really? That would actually be wonderful. That is the best thing I've heard all day. Thank you. Yeah, cool. But we're gonna have to do it soon, because my blood sugar's starting to drop, so. Okay. Yeah. Sure, I'll grab my phone. All right, let's do this. So. What'd you guys do while I was gone? Ah, we just played on my laptop. No! You didn't make bets in front of Holden, did you? He's a genius, you know? Yeah, I know. He knows sports better than anybody that I've ever met. But I knew how you felt about it, so we refrained. Really? Good kid. Yeah. All right, show me. Okay. See? You just got the games, there's the betting line, and you can bet whatever you want. Hm. Wait, what's that? Did April make a bet? Oh yeah, she asked me to set this up for her. I think she's gonna start trying it. What? God, that's so weird. I don't know, I think there's something going on with her. She made this bet, she sold her car. She obviously needs money. She's been going through a lot lately. Yeah, I know. I just wish she would take money when I offer it to her. It's like... I have an idea. She won't take money from me, but she will take it if she thinks she won it. Mm-hm! Michael, will you please just tell her she hit it big on one of her bets, and I'll give you the money to give to her. Okay. If that's what you want me to do, then I'll do it. Thank you. There's actually something else I want to talk to you about. Actually, I don't even know how to say this to you. What is it? Is it my blood work? Yeah. It is your blood work. I don't know how to tell you this. Michael... You're completely healthy! Yeah, you have a complete bill of health. Healthy? Yes, you're like 100% healthy. I don't know, I'm gonna have to get a second opinion. Well you're like a super-young doctor. Right, okay. Well I was thinking about kissing you tonight, but I don't know if that's gonna happen anymore. (CHUCKLING) Heart rate picking up? Yeah. (LAUGHING) You gonna be okay? Yeah, I'm good. Luckily I have a doctor in the house. You do, a young one though. Still better than nothing. (LAUGHING) Now you're really not getting kissed. (LAUGHING) (GENTLE MUSIC) 95 miles per hour, ah! (EXPLOSION NOISES) Hi, sweetie pie! Everything okay? Yes, everything is fine. Can I please have dad's guitar? Sure, sweetie. Super ultra beginner strumming, nice and easy, with lots of patience. (PLUCKING GUITAR) Hi, it's me. Hello, Steven, are you okay? How are you? How is he? How's he doing? He has you guitar again. It's just so awful. First he lost Natalie, and he's lost you. He's watching videos on the internet. He's trying to teach himself how to play the guitar. He misses you so much, Steven. Okay. I, uh... I have to go. (SOFT MUSIC) I only did what you asked me to do. (CRYING SOFTLY) I'm sorry. What have I done? I miss him so much. Good morning, my beautiful princess. Good morning, my love. Really? (CHUCKLING) Love? Define love. What? It's not like you to be so insecure. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) DAVID: Seriously. Define true love. Love is... Okay, so if the universe lined up all the men in the world, and I had to choose, every single morning I'd choose one man. Every single morning, I would choose you without a second thought. You are the most amazing woman I've ever seen in my life. You always knock me off my feet. And I had a little production planned for us tonight, but because of what you've said, I've changed my mind and I'm gonna do it right now. Hold on one second. Oh my god! Will you marry me? Yes, yes, yes! I guess we're not going to work today. (LAUGHING) JAMES: I don't think so. - I love you so much. - I love you. (LAUGHING) Wait, we gotta try this one first. Oh, yes, make sure it fits. There we go. What do you think? I think you're my wife. I love you. (CRYING) (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC) SHARON: There you are! Sharon. I've decided to have lunch with you today. It's tuna! You want it? Sure. Are... Are you in a hurry? No. Is there something I can help you with? Yeah. (SOFT GUITAR MUSIC) There he is! With the red backpack! His name is Adam. Here. I want you to give him this guitar. Okay. Hi, Adam. Hi. I know you problem don't know me, but I have something very special from someone who loves you very much. Is it from my dad? Can I see him? I miss him. I'm sure you're gonna see him soon. What? Listen. I know you probably shouldn't be talking to strangers, so take it and go straight home. So. You have a kid, huh? Okay, lay it on me. What, is mom complaining about me again? No, she just wants to see you. You know, her doctor. (CHUCKLING) I know. I don't know, maybe we could go visit her next weekend. Mm-hm. Yeah. Well, no matter what I am, you will always be her favorite. Oh, no, they're so proud of you. Mom always calls you wonder woman. I have to agree. I mean, I can barely get through the day, and I don't have children. I know, I felt like there's been something going on with you. You just, you haven't been yourself lately. You look sad. Yeah. There's something that I've been meaning to tell you. Last time when I went to the doctors, they told me that, because of the miscarriage... I can't have kids. What? Are you sure? I mean, did you get a second opinion. Of course. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. What did David say when you told him? David wanted kids. I wanted that for David. I couldn't tell him. April! I hate to tell you this, but you have to tell him the truth. Promise me that you will! I mean, I'm not trying to tell you what to do, but trust me on this one. He deserves to know. Honey, this did not just happen to you. It happened to both of you. Okay. I know what you're thinking, but it's more complicated than that. He's better off this way. Ever since I got back from Afghanistan, my... My mind has been wrestling with the things that I've seen. And I can be difficult to live with. And a few months ago, Natalie was diagnosed with cancer. I lost the will to live. I wish it wasn't true, but he's better off with his grandparents. I believe every problem can be solved. Whenever you're ready, please come and visit me at my office. I could really use your help. I know. Unless we have more pieces that have gone into the abyss. Yeah. (CHUCKLING) I give up. You give up? - It doesn't look like that. - We just started! We're off to a bad start. Hi, guys. Hi, April. Oh, hey, April. Did you talk to David? No. April! Okay, that's it. You are coming with me right now. Why? We are not coming back to this house until you tell him the truth. Yes! Michael? Do you mind watching Holden for an hour or so? Yeah, sure, this'll take us at least an hour to build. Thank you. Okay, let's go! April, yes! I give up. So what else do you want to do? I'll get the laptop. Ah, not so fast. I got a better idea. Now, have you thought about becoming a doctor like your mom? I haven't decided yet. Well can I get you to check my pulse? No, I don't really know how. Ah, it's super easy. I'll teach you. All right, take your finger, put 'em right there. You're gonna hit that main artery, and you're gonna feel my heartbeat. Now, just the fingertips. Now, can you feel it? Yeah. Okay, now, I'm gonna have you count that for 15 seconds. And go. (GENTLE MUSIC) All right, what'd you come up with? 16. Okay. Now you multiply that times four. 64. 64. See, I knew that this thing was off. Annoying. We should do it again. Mike, if you ever want me to make you a hot chocolate, I know how to make the best hot chocolate in the world. Well do you have almond milk? 'Cause I can't have dairy. Yes, I think we do. All right. Okay, ready? Go talk to him. He deserves to know. You can do this. Okay? I love you, April. Mm, here, taste it. Not after you drank out of it! No freaking way! Come on, drink it! My bacteria are super friendly. You know I like you, kid, but I don't like you that much. Drink it! Fine. Okay, you got me, it's good. (LAUGHING) it's a little gross though. (LAUGHING) May I help you? Hi. Yeah, does Sharon work here? Here, come on in. Take any seat you'd like. Cool, yeah. So... I have this friend who might be able to help you out. His name is James Marver. We served together in Afghanistan. I heard he's a pretty successful businessman, and he's dabbled in stocks. I don't have his number, but we might be able to find it. M-A-R-V-E-R, right? Yeah. Is that him? Yeah, that's him. Look. I know you're the one that told Michael to give me the money, okay? And I'm not taking it. April! I'm just trying to help you. I know. And I love you so much. And I'm so lucky to have you in my life. You know, I'm not saying things aren't hard. I want my husband back. LISA: I know, sweetie. I love you. - Oh, honey, I love you too. - Seriously, take this. Okay? LISA: Okay. I'm gonna be okay. (KNOCKING) Steven Leary. James Marver. God, it's good to see you, man. You know, I've been trying to reach out. You're impossible to find. Yeah. We need to catch up. But first, this is Sharon Rogan. She made this whole thing happen. Hi. Hi, pleasure to meet you, Sharon. Pleasure to meet you. Thank you for making this all happen. Thank you. It almost didn't. Please, have a seat. Okay. This is it? So I looked everything over, and apparently your products are very unique, and you're stepping into an untapped market. I mean, I'd say you're lucky that contract fell through. You really should be with someone who's gonna give you full control. Now, Great Foods Inc. recently dropped their fresh produce market, and they're looking for someone with zero competition. The CEO and I are already in business together, so I think if we show him this plan, within six weeks you'll pick up right where you left off. I don't want to sound pathetic, but you're my hero! I'm here to stay. How about refills, huh? Coffee. How do you take it? Cream, sugar? Yeah. Leary, why don't we grab some dinner and maybe head back to my place? We got a lot of catching up to do. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Of course, yes, this is gonna be great. (SOFT MUSIC) All right! You know what, I probably shouldn't. Thank you. Oh. You know what, you're right. Let's stick to water, right? Keep the minds clear. I love it. Thank you. JAMES: I will be right back. Perfect. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey, to you, man. You must doing all right for yourself. This is quite a place you've got here. And tell me what's been going on with you. Tell me more about your kid. He is so talented. He just took up the guitar, and he's teaching himself how to play. He's a chip off the old block. He's so smart. Good, man. Good for you. Listen, I'm sorry again to hear about Natalie, man. It's just awful. She seemed like such a great girl. I mean, based on all those video chats you used to have back at the base, remember? (CHUCKLING) Yeah. She used to call every weekend. What a girl. It's gotta be pretty tough raising that kid on your own. He's got a great dad. Well, you know, Rita, Natalie's mom actually has him... a lot of the time. And that makes it easier. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that's awesome. Good. Good, good. So, uh... Sharon said she could use you in the office tomorrow. That's cool. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. You never had good taste in clothes. (LAUGHING) Ever. In this history of knowing you. (LAUGHING) STEVEN: Shut up! No worries, man, I got you. Yeah, let's take a walk, let's take a walk. STEVEN: Okay. JAMES: Need a refill? STEVEN: Let's top her off. Now when we clothes that deal, we'll go shopping. But for now, I want you to have a few things. All right. Either of these look good? Thank you so much. Boy, it's so good to see you. Of course, man. Of course. You do need to do one thing for me. I mean, I thought you liked the beard. No, I do. Distinguished. No, I like it man, just... I'm messing with you, dude, come on. Thank you, thank you. Fresh start. Fresh start. Sharon. Steven? Is that really you? That's the man underneath the beard? Wow, this is... You're all cleaned up! Right? How good does he look? Yeah? Pretty snazzy? Really? - It's okay, it works? - You look amazing! Right? Wow, Steven! Looking sharp. Quite a stud we have here on our team. Come on, let's get back to work. Let's get down to business. I'm getting used to it. It's good. You're very clean cut. It's a great image for you. Yeah, you think it'll suit the company? It's exactly... That's what we're going for. Fresh and original. (SOFT PIANO MUSIC) How did you know where to find me? You know me. I've got my ways. I can't let you go. If we end this, then I'll be staying young forever in your mind, and I don't want that. I want to grow old with you. I want to create our own family. I don't care if we can't have our own children. We can adopt some. Do you know how many kids out there would love to have you as a mother? You're in my family forever, and I'm not letting you go. Come back home. Of course you are my family! (GENTLE PIANO MUSIC) (KNOCKING) May I come in? Yeah, sure. Hi. What's the matter? Um... Something wrong? Yeah, I have something to tell you. Okay. All right. Well, you know how I said that our plan would take about six weeks to unfold? SHARON: Mm-hm. It's happening now. You mean as in right now? As in right now? Oh my god, James, this is unbelievable! You're a genius! No, no, no, your product did all the talking. Wow, I can't... I am just astounded. I can't believe it. Before you head out, I was wondering if you would consider being my business partner. I don't have to consider. I will be your business partner. And I want you to consider... going to dinner with me. I don't have to consider it. I'll go to dinner with you. Pick you up at eight? - Tonight? - Mm-hm. Sure. Great. STEVEN VOICEOVER: That man sitting on the bench is me. I chose to be here. Every single morning, I choose to be here. I've lost all my drive. I want to tell you a secret. None of this really happened. True, all is foreseen, and freedom of choice is given. We have the freedom of choice and the opportunity to decide, but what are the chances that each of us will leave our comfort zone? Sharon never really stopped next to me. She was too busy feeling sorry for herself. Michael, as a hypochondriac, is too self-centered to let someone dependent into his life. April never got the courage to tell her sister that she needs help. So, yes. We can decide to a certain degree how our life will look. So from now on, pay attention to the next choice you make, because you never know where it might lead. (GENTLE ELECTRONIC MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull
