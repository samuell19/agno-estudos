-I am going inside. -Okay. Yeah. I'm on my way. I'll be there in half an hour. -Bye, dear. -Bye, mom. My, oh my! Be careful. Surprise! -Naina Teacher! -Naina Teacher! Okay. Come on. Go to your desks, everybody. Go to your desks. Hi! Naina! Thank God you are back. We thought you would be back next week. But it is good to see you back. -I hope you are feeling better. -I am. Yes. Much better. I was missing these devils. Isn't it Niharika's birthday tomorrow? -You remember! -Of course! I remember everyone's birthdays. But actually, Niharika and I are birthday buddies. -What? -Yes. Oh my God! Happy birthday to you in advance. Thank you. -Happy birthday. -Thank you. You know I was thinking since tomorrow is a bank holiday followed by the weekend. We'll miss celebrating her birthday. Is it okay if we celebrate it today? Naina, it's getting too late for me today. -That's why... -Hold on. I will order cake and snacks. Don't worry. Is it okay to just... for your driver to bring it over? That's so sweet of you, Naina. -I'll just... -All right. Hey! Aakash, what are you doing? Savitri Tai, why are you standing upside down? You will fall down. If you break your head, I will be held responsible. It's okay, Savitri. Children are very tough. -He doesn't listen to me at all. -Savitri, is everything all right? -Yes. -Yes? Ma'am, I have to change my address on the Aadhar card tomorrow. Sorry. -It's okay. You can go today. -How could I leave today? You are back after three weeks. How could I leave today? It's okay. I will handle them. You can leave once you get them settled. -Are you sure? -Yes. Hold on. Wait a minute. -Keep this. -What's this for? Keep it. -Thank you. -What? You're welcome. Okay. Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Rohit! Hello. -Hey! -Good morning. Good morning. Don't you have to go to court today? It looks like I will be at my client's factory the whole day. It's three hours away. You know that Jeevanjees Industries merger. What are you doing on a corporate case? Honestly, I don't know what I am doing. But they have evidence of fraud. And it has turned into an all-out criminal case. You never listen to me. Just take your frustration out in front of me. Really? Get the Jeevanjees to liquidate their assets. All their assets. So that the conglomerate cannot buy them outright. And you will find out if there is any fraud activity. What are you looking at? -You didn't hear a word I said. -No. I am listening. I want to listen up closely. You don't have to come so close. There are kids... -What? -Crummies! You still eat like a child. -It's okay. I will clean it up. -No. It's okay. You know you would have been a solid... Prosecutor? Yes. I know. But I am happy being a teacher. And I am happy being in love with one. Cheesy! Cheesy or whatever, but it is the truth. Anyways... Naina... Okay. I know what you feel about birthdays. -Very good. -Right? You have no intentions to celebrate your birthday. Absolutely not. Naina... It's your thirtieth birthday. -Yes. -What yes? It calls for a small celebration at least with friends. Please? Please... Pretty please. How many times do I have to say please? Such a drama queen! -Okay, go! -Fantastic. I will sort everything out and make the arrangements. And I'll see you tonight. -I love you. -Yes. I love you too. Maya Rajguru will be arriving at Mumbai airport shortly. It's estimated that over a million people will be attending her rally at South Mumbai's Azad maidan. Man, this PM is fantastic! She is the only one who can truly change our country. -Hats off to her! -You are so overly dramatic! What? Why? Salute the people who deserve it. In fact, I think I should do something for our country too. Yes. You are doing it already. You are doing enough. Now, leave. All right. I love you, and I'll see you tonight. -Okay? Bye. -Bye. She has already apologised in her tweet expressing regret for the traffic jam caused due to her rally. -Good morning, class! -Good morning, Teacher! What should we do today? Poems? Alphabet? -Or cartoons? -Cartoons! -Cartoons! -Come on. Come on. Have a seat, everyone. Be careful. Okay. Are you ready? Let's go! -Hello. -Hello, Colaba police station. I am calling from Little Tots Playschool, Colaba. My name is Naina Jaiswal. I am the teacher here. I have taken 16 children hostage. And I have some demands. I have reached, dear. Wow! Oh no! Oh God! Where is my phone? Oh no! Good morning, ma'am. Renuka madam sent me. I brought a cake for Niharika and some sandwiches, ma'am. Ma'am, should I just keep it here? No. Please come in. -Okay, ma'am. -Hurry up. -Ma'am... -Yes. -Driver uncle. -Hello, dear. Which way, ma'am? -Straight ahead. -Okay. This is nice. If you let children watch cartoons, -they sit quietly. -Keep it over there. -Where should I keep it, ma'am? -Over there. You have a lovely house, ma'am. It is a school and a house. Amazing. -Where, ma'am? -Over here. I'll keep it here. Oops! I am sorry, ma'am. Ma'am, a gun? What's this, ma'am? What are you doing? -There are children here, ma'am. -Be quiet. Quiet. Be quiet, or I will kill you. -Ma'am, let me go. -Quiet. -I won't tell anyone. -Shut up! No, ma'am... Ma'am, what you are doing is wrong. There are children here. I didn't ask you for advice. Keep your opinions to yourself or else... Sorry... Oh no! What a nuisance! Ma'am, why are you doing this? Think about the children, ma'am. Let me go, ma'am. I won't tell anyone. I won't tell anyone about this. Hello, Savitri! Ma'am... I am back, ma'am. They will need an OTP for the Aadhar card. I left my phone here. Found it. Who dropped the sandwiches on the floor? Ma'am, how did it fall down? The doorbell had been turned off. Ma'am... -Who is that man, ma'am? -Quiet. -Ma'am! -Quiet. No, ma'am! No... -Oh my! Is anyone there? -Quiet! Tie your legs. This is not who you are, ma'am. This is not nice. Is someone making you do this? Tell me. Ma'am, let me go. Let me go home, ma'am. Ramesh is at home, ma'am. Please let me go. Ramesh? Are you talking about that alcoholic? If you die today, he will find out after 2 day. Ma'am... It is so funny. Ma'am... Ma'am... Okay. Come on. No more cartoons. Now, we are going to eat sandwiches. No. Please... Teacher, please five more minutes. No five more minutes. If you don't eat your sandwich, the cartoons will come out of the TV and eat it up. Cartoons are fake. How will they come out of the TV? -Yes! -Okay, smarty pants! Get up. Come on. Come here! -One second. -No! Come here. Yes. Come here. Did you take one? Look at my hands. Excuse me, sir! Wait a minute! What's the matter, sir? Is there a problem with the playschool? It happens every day, sir. Children come here and make noise, and then they go home. Not that. Are the children being held hostage by Naina? Sir, Naina is the only one who can handle these devils. Stay right here. Darn it! The children are watching cartoons. I simply wasted my time here. -Tell me, Lokhande. -Ma'am, everything is fine here. I think it was a prank call. Lokhande, it was my day off. I even delayed my doctor's appointment. I am so... so sorry, ma'am. You love to waste time. Ma'am, get back. Ma'am, I don't think it's a prank anymore. Get out! Out, everyone! -Do you have her mobile number? -Yes, ma'am. Call her! -Her name is Naina Jaiswal. -Okay. God-damnit! Get in the car. Hello, Naina. This is ACP Catherine Alvarez speaking. How many children are inside? I want to speak to Javed Khan. Javed? Why Javed Khan? I want to speak to Javed Khan. Look, Naina. Whatever demands you have... Nothing can happen without my permission. I am Javed Khan's boss. How many children are inside? 16. Who else is at home? My helper Savitri and one of the kids' driver. -What is the driver doing? -Driving the car. -Naina, listen to me. -No. You listen to me. I want to speak to Javed Khan. You have one hour. Naina! Bitch! Lokhande, call for backup. "PAIN" Not her again Hello. Talk softly, ma'am. You are pregnant. Yes. I am listening. Yes. What? What did you say? When did I become so famous? I wasn't kidding... Don't yell at me, ma'am. I am not deaf. Yes. I'm on my way. I'll be there. Naina Teacher, susu! No! What do we say? -May I use the washroom? -Yes, Teacher. Washroom susu! Okay. Who else wants to go? Come on! I'll call Savitri. Get in a line. Savitri, the children want to use the washroom.

If anyone dares to act like a hero, I will shoot them! Ma'am, why are you doing this? What are you lacking? Please tell me what's wrong. -It's charging. -Wow! Cool! Do you want to know? Flush! How many times have I told you? You must always flush after using the washroom. Who's next? Tell me. Oh Lord! How did I end up here? You shouldn't have forgotten your mobile. What was the driver's fault? His bad luck. Next. -Lokhande! -Yes, ma'am. -Take over this coffee shop. -Okay, ma'am. -What's this? Is it a theatre? -Yes. -Set up a base here. -Come on. What are you looking at? How much time will it take to move this civilian car? Whose car is that? -Park it elsewhere. -Hurry up! Move that tanker. I want more space.

Lokhande, call for backup! -How many people will you handle? -Yes, ma'am. -I asked you to clear that building. -Yes. -Get the neighbours out of here. -I will ask them to leave. To be or not to be. That is the question. You too! Move, drama company. Empty the hall. Get up. -What's going on? -Uncle, we'll tell you everything. We are having a prayer meeting. How could you do this? -What's the matter? -There was a gunshot! Didn't you hear? Sir, this room is soundproof. It is soundproof, not bulletproof. Get out! Get the set up. -Okay, sir. -Hurry up! We will tell you. Let's go. Come on! Tawde! Take him to the coffee shop. Close the gate. Hey, guys! Sorry for the last-minute invite. We are celebrating Naina's birthday tonight at 8 pm, so be there. Don't be late. See you guys soon. Hi! I have some demands from the police. That's why I held the children hostage. I don't have anything against the children. But if the police don't meet my demands, things might go wrong. The police are responsible for the lives of the children. This will be in the news soon. I don't want anyone to take it as a joke. Don't try to act smart or the children might lose their lives. Thank you. You will block the exit. And you keep an eye at the door. Come on. Hurry up. Stop recording! Are we having a party here? Yes, Sid. I am sorry, but I had to cancel the doctor's appointment. What do you mean by why? There is an emergency at work. It is my f**king job, Sid! F**k! Bro, what's up? I hope you are coming tonight! What? You think I will fall for your prank! Fine. Disconnect the call now. I'll see you in the evening. Crazy! Hi. I have some demands from the police. That's why I held the children hostage. What the... F**k! Calling Naina Come on, Naina. What are you doing? Pick up my call. Teacher, I want water. Okay. Go get your bottle. One, two, three! Your mom just called. She is running a bit late today. No problem, teacher. I will watch cartoons the whole day. Really? The whole day! Oh my God! Go on. -Ma'am, please have a seat. -Be quiet. -Where are the neighbours? -They are at the coffee shop. Come on. Over here. Sir is here. Do you want me to get yelled at? Take it away. Patil, go over there. Thank you. Thank you for coming here so soon. You shouldn't have assigned night duty to me, ma'am. Encounters at night and negotiator by day. What's this? Why does she want to talk to me? How would I know? Now that you are here, find out yourself! Then at least tell me. Who should I talk to? Naina Jaiswal. We are going to talk to the neighbours now. Oh! You are going now? Go ahead, ma'am. I am with you. Sir... Where could she have bought the gun from? Shall I trace it? You've been spending a lot of time with ma'am. You want a medal too! The gun and the culprit are together, right? Yes, sir. Why do you want to increase your workload? Come on. Medal ma'am is waiting. Naina is holding 16 children hostage. -What? -What? That's impossible! Well, it is possible because it is true. -Does this house belong to Naina? -No. It belongs to her fiancé Rohit Mirchandani. Naina runs a playschool here. You mean they both are involved. No, sir. Rohit left for the office in the morning. Where does he work? Chelaram associates. He is a reputed criminal lawyer. -Could someone call him right now? -Yes, sir. Mrs Joshi calling Aunty, could you please tell me what's happening? -What happened to her? -Rohit. This is inspector Javed Khan. Listen, sir. Naina is disconnecting my calls. Is she fine? Is she okay? -I am really worried about her, sir. -Where are you? Sir, I am far from home right now, but I am on my way back. Send your live location and your car number plate to this number. Come soon. The weather and the situation here are getting worse by the minute. Sir, may I... Sir! Let me go in. My daughter is inside. -Please calm down. -What the hell is happening? Call your officers now! We've been waiting for a long time. No one is giving us any information. What's going on? You've been saying the same thing. We are their parents. You can't stop us like this. -Please call them. -Are you the one in charge? -Call your officers. -Sir! Sir, I understand what you are going through. No, you don't! Let us meet our children. Sir, I can't let you go inside. We don't know what's happening inside. We don't know who Naina is or what she wants. But, ma'am, please try to understand. Sir, I cannot allow that. If you have any information about Naina, -Please tell us. -Ma'am... Naina was on sick leave for three weeks. She came back today. This means the playschool was shut. No. I was the substitute. Actually, Naina wasn't supposed to return for another week. But she called me last night and told me that she was returning today. Ma'am, Naina is a good girl. -This is very shocking. -What shocking? She has sent a video on the parents group. She uploaded the video online. Sir, please wait for some time. Give me some time. I will have you seated inside. Lokhande, take them to the coffee shop. -Or the media will hound them. -Yes, ma'am. Remove the barricades. I want only the parents to come with me. She sent the video to the parents! She called the police herself. She is nothing but a bloody attention seeker. Dheeraj, check Naina Jaiswal's social media pages. -Okay. -What was she doing during the last three weeks and where she was? I want all the information right now. -Hurry up. -Connect my phone. Okay, sir. Come on! Move! -Hurry up! -Tactical team? These people? You... Why did you call them here? There are kids inside, right? I know there are children inside, but they are at gunpoint. And you want to put more guns in there? Cathy, the children will be blown to pieces! Have you lost your mind? Don't you dare talk to me like that. Don't waste time. The target is right here. Storm the bloody house and get this over with. Don't talk about precautions. I have never seen you use the safety lock on your gun. Because my gun is always in my control. This operation will also be under my control. She called me here. I am the one in charge. I will make decisions and give orders. Do you understand, ma'am? Captain, on my orders only! Copy that, ma'am. Come on, guys. Hurry up. You just have to make a call. Why is it taking so long? Sir, just a minute. Please. Please send two more men to the barricade. Quick! Naina -Headset. -Ma'am. Hello, Naina. Javed Khan. Look, no one is interested in waiting around. There are children inside who are unaware. Their parents are pining for them. The police are worried because we are under pressure. If you want, you can put an end to all this. Which idiot told you that I wanted to stop all this? The show has just begun, Inspector Khan. Fine. Let's talk. In such a big police force, why ask for me? I don't think we know each other. Correct, but there is always an article about super cop Javed Khan. Should I take this as a compliment or a challenge? As you wish. Fine. Let's get to the point. -What do you want? -50 million. Done. What else? You should have my background information and bank details with you. You can transfer it there. You will let the children go after that. I will let only one child go. Naina, how this works is, after I transfer the 50 million, to your bank account, I will pay, at our own cost, for a chartered aeroplane, and you can go wherever you want. The children will stay right here. This is what we should do, right? One hour. 50 million. Should I repeat myself? Just because she praised you, doesn't mean you accept her demands. You agreed to give her 50 million! There are 59 minutes left. Shall we get the money ready? What if she asks for the Taj Mahal next? -Damn it! -58 and a half minutes. Ma'am, those blueprints are ready. There are three entry points to the house. The playschool. This is the main entrance and a backyard. The kids should be at the playschool. Their house is at the back. Sir, look at this. Naina posted this video just now. I asked the police for 50 million. As soon as I get the payment, I will let a child go. The police have 49 minutes left. If they don't meet my demands, I will kill one child every hour. In alphabetical order. So, first, it will be A for Aakash. Aakash! Shekhar... Please save my Aakash. Please save him. Our respected Prime Minister Mrs Maya Rajguru will be arriving at South Mumbai soon. This is Shalini Guha from Public News and Broadcast channel wishing all of you a very good day. And we are out! Shalini, your phone is ringing non-stop. Our producer is after that breaking news girl! Shalini, shush! Talk to Malcolm about your promotion. Him? He is an as***le. Hi! I have some demands from the police. -What's happening? -There is a piece of breaking news. Someone is holding children hostage. Damn sad! I don't have anything against the children. It's not like I'll be giving the breaking news anyway. Shalini, where are you going? Take your phone. What is it? Who's calling? Hello? Yeah! No. Not today. No, actually, she's leaving now. I have some demands from the police. That's why I held the children hostage. Okay. I don't have anything against the children. -Come here tomorrow. If the police don't meet my demands... -I'll call you later. -...things might take a bad turn. -Shalini! Shalini... -Shruti, -this is Yash's school. -What? Shalini! Listen! What are you saying? Call the driver, quick. Hello. Driver, get the car ready. Ma'am is coming downstairs. Okay, guys. We are going live in one minute. Everyone, be ready. Okay. Make it very emotional. I want full melodrama. Make it clear that Shalini Guha is our journalist. Everyone should feel sorry for her. In every sentence, -bombard PNBC's name. -Yes, sir. -Okay? -Yes, sir. Let's go! Going live in 5, 4, 3... Our sources have confirmed that Naina Jaiswal has demanded 50 million from the Mumbai Police. It's 12:30 pm now. A while ago, Naina Jaiswal shot at the police. As you can see, super cop Javed Khan and ACP Alvarez are handling the situation. Today's breaking news is coming from Mumbai's posh Colaba area. A playschool teacher is holding 16 children hostage. What you are witnessing here is shocking. We have to see who's going to win, the police or Naina's craziness! Close your eyes and look up in the sky. And imagine stars. -Twinkle twinkle little star. -Twinkle twinkle little star. How I wonder what you are? Up above the world so high -like a diamond in the sky. -Like a diamond in the sky. Niharika! Niharika! Niharika! Niharika! You have 32 minutes left. Ro? Why didn't you answer the call? I have been trying for half an hour. What the f**k is going on? Has Naina lost her mind? How would I know? I don't know what's happening. Who else would know? You were going to marry this psycho, right? You think I am not trying! I don't give a f**k, Rohit. You have to get my son out. You know... Rohit, you know that Yash is all I have. Please... Please, Rohit. Just... I am trying. Hey! Have you lost your mind? What's wrong with you people? Just leave us alone! Sir. -The money has been organised. -We have 25 minutes. Javed, she won't do anything. Sir, she won't shoot the children. Can you guarantee it? She already shot once. Your team is not equipped for this situation. Javed, she is only one woman. Let's move in and get this done and over with in two minutes. You... Sorry, sir. I... -Javed! -Sir, let him go. Catherine, it's been three hours. Firstly, the PM is in town. So, we are under pressure. Now, all this is happening. If we make a mistake, the PM, the PMO and the media will not spare us. -Sort is out. -Sir. Now! Dheeraj, come in. Except for her phone line, I want you to disconnect her data, -Wi-Fi and TV transmission. -Copy. Move in. Okay, listen. The A team will go in through the front and the B team will come with me through the back. A team won't attack. That's only for backup. The children might be in front. -Clear? -Yes, sir! Move! Sir, the footage is amazing. Start the live broadcast. As you can see, the brave cameramen of PNBC have captured this exclusive footage. The police tactical team are at the area behind the building. The children will be released soon. Maybe this step might cost them dearly. Be careful, boys. Halt. Ma'am, we are in position. What the hell! Our children are inside! We have organised the money. Give me ten minutes. You disconnected my internet connection and TV transmission. -No, Naina. Listen to me. -No. You listen to me! The police are trying to come in even though I warned you. No. No one is trying to come in, Naina. If you don't stop this drama in two minutes, watch what I do. Now! Check it. What are you doing? -Please... -Open the f**king door! What's this? Cathy, what are you doing? Have you lost your mind? Back off, Javed! You... Check again. It seems the tactical team has entered the house. Ma'am, she's shooting at us. You... Javed! Back off right now! Copy. Back off. See what you did! Kids... There are some bad people outside. I will handle them. Okay? Just shut your ears. Shut your ears, everyone. Sir, the door is opening. Don't fire at the door. The children might be around. -Lokhande! -Yes, sir. Tell everyone to back off. Back off! Bullets are being fired! Back off! Get the media to back off! Tell them to back off! Sir, her phone is back online. How? Didn't you disconnect everything? There are two more people inside. She must have used their hotspot, sir. Aakash, come here. I want to show you something. The rest of you can watch TV. Come on. Let's go. Now, can we play that game? -The shooting game. -Yes, teacher. I will play with you. -Yes? Okay. Go and stand there. -Okay. Yes. Like that. Naina Teacher, shoot me! Naina Teacher, shoot me! Shoot me! Naina Teacher, shoot me! -Naina Teacher, shoot me! -That's Aakash! Do something! -Please save him. -Naina Teacher, shoot me! Naina Teacher, shoot me! Shoot me! Naina Teacher, shoot me! Javed Khan, I warned you. A for Aakash. Let me go! No! Stop! What's your next order, ma'am? Hmm? Catherine, leave now! But sir... A child was shot on national television. Do you know what this means? -But, sir, I was... -Enough! Take a team with you and do the groundwork. I want to know everything about this girl. What? Dismiss! There are 15 children left to be sacrificed. But go ahead and do that which gets you another medal. Cathy, thank God we never had a child. Our marriage ended, And you have moved on. You are going to be a mother. Try to have some empathy, Cathy! All okay? -What happened? -No... There were some bad people, -and I pushed them away. -Yay! You guys watch cartoons. Okay? The internet has been restored. The money has been transferred. I know. Let one child go. Write these two names properly. There should be no mistakes. Rakesh Mathur and Charan Kumar. I want them both. They worked at BWC School in Goregaon. If your silence means yes, shall we continue? What games are you playing, Naina? Why don't you say everything at once? There are 15 children left, Inspector Khan. Why don't you make an estimate? I want to speak to the Prime Minister of India. What? What did you say? Should I repeat myself? Naina! Sir, she will post her demand online any second now. Block her account. -Communication... -We saw what happened when we disconnected communications. There is only one way. But will the PM talk to Naina... I'll do something. Sir! Lokhande, write these two names. Rakesh Mathur and Charan Kumar. They worked at BWC School in Goregaon. If they are dead, forget them. But if they are alive, bring them to me. Yes. Okay. My first demand has been met. This is my next demand. I want to talk to our Prime Minister. If she doesn't talk to me, she will be responsible for the death of the next child. She has one hour. -Ma'am! -Ma'am! Ma'am, would you like to say something about the hostage situation? Did you speak to Naina? -You only have one hour. -A child might lose his life. Did you meet their families? The citizens of Mumbai are holding the police responsible. -Give us an answer, ma'am. -Please tell us, ma'am. -Ma'am... -What's going on here? Ma'am, we are looking into this situation. We are trying to figure out, -but... -But what? Why are they asking me about the hostages? But, ma'am... -I need answers. -Okay. Why does this girl want to talk to me? Ma'am, if you want, I can call the chief minister. No. Cancel everything. I don't want anyone here. Get me the NSA and the Home Minister on call. And get me the police commissioner here now! -Okay. -I want a detailed report. Why are you doing this, Naina Teacher? Why aren't you letting us go home, Naina Teacher? Please let us go. -Teacher, please can I go to my mom? -Please let me go to my parents. Don't kill me. It's my birthday today. Only a mentally unstable person could have done this. Look at this woman's face carefully. This woman took a kid's life on national television... -She took a child's life. -A woman took a child's life. A school teacher shot the child dead. This women is crazy The police must take action soon. Unbelievable, guys! What about the poor parents of Aakash? The woman who was to take care of Aakash... She is the one who took his life. Giving so much importance to that woman was a bad idea. She did such a terrible thing for the sum of 50 million. Aakash's life was... As you can see on the screen, Naina allowed Dia Jaisingh to go. She brutally murdered this child Aakash Desai. What game is Naina playing? Looking at the numbers, India definitely doesn't want the Prime Minister to talk to this cold-blooded... 60% of the population don't want the Prime Minister to talk to a dangerous woman like Naina Jaiswal. 75% of the population don't want the Prime Minister to call Naina. If you want the PM to talk to Naina Jaiswal... Go to our website and... Ma'am... Ma'am, the Home Minister and the NSA Chief are on a video call. Good afternoon, ma'am. Greetings, ma'am. How are you? Let's get to the point, please. Ma'am, you cannot speak to Naina Jaiswal. Ma'am, there is a system in place. We have to follow protocol. If you speak to her today, someone might try to do the same thing tomorrow. People will start demanding things from you. This is an act of terror. No one can control the future. But today, 14 children are being held at gunpoint. You want to talk about protocol and procedure! IC 814, Kandahar. How can we forget? Ma'am, those were 176 passengers... -And this... -These are children, Home Minister. Their lives are equally important. Ma'am, she has been making demands every hour. As a safety, we should give the go-ahead to 52 SAGs. Mr Singh is right. NSA has their protocols in place. Ma'am, we have to move in and move in now. No! We have to make decisions keeping those children in mind. Not your bloody protocols. The police have tried once. The rest, you know. Keep the commandos on standby. Bear in mind. I don't want any news to be leaked to the media. -Is that clear? -Copy that, ma'am. -Prakash. -Yes, ma'am. What are you thinking? Ma'am, in today's world, the name Maya Rajguru has given people hope for a new India. According to the poll, the same Indians don't want you to speak to Naina Jaiswal. That's all, ma'am. Rohit! Rohit! Let me go! Rohit! What happened? Did you find anything? No, sir. During the last three weeks, there were no deposits in her bank account nor any social media activities. -She looks clean, sir. -Does she seem clean? You have been staring at the computer. Find something. Clean! Sir! You... Sir, I am Rohit Mirchandani. I... Actually, I want to talk to Naina, sir. I have been trying to call her. But I am unable to talk to her. Sir, I don't know how or why this happened, but let me help you. I want to talk to Naina. Please. I don't know... I am so confused. I am also confused. Have a seat. Sit down. I don't smoke. Shalini Answer it. Shalini F**k! Your gun's safety is off. Yes. I always keep it off. You seem to know a lot about guns. Sir, I am a criminal lawyer. I have seen a lot of guns. But I never used one. But Naina is using one. Did you give it to her? -Since when do you know her? -Who? I won't keep taking Naina's name. How long have you known her? 7 years. Who does she have in her family? Naina's dad passed away 15 years ago. I am asking about those who are still alive. Naina's mom. -She lives with her. -Where is she? -Her mother. -Sir, how would I know that? She should be at home. She could be anywhere. How... Speakerphone. The number you are trying to reach is currently switched off. "The number you are trying to reach" -is currently switched off. -Unnati, come in. Please try... Is she at home? Are you sure? -The last dialled number. -Listen. You cannot... Find out the location. Do you have her mom's photo? It's a new phone. There are no photos here. The old photos are backed up on the desktop. Right! Mr Lawyer! What happened three weeks ago? What do you mean? She was on leave for three weeks. Why? She was sick. What other reason could there be? Sir, it's not what you think. There has to be some logical explanation for this. This is why I have been telling you that I want to speak to Naina. I could help you by talking to her... Tell me, Inspector. Naina... Naina, this is Rohit. Naina, please listen to me. I have been trying to reach you... I'll send some tea. As promised, I have released a child. If the PM speaks to me, I will release two more children. Prakash. -Did you watch the video? -Yes, ma'am. Give me a solution, Prakash. Ma'am, the public doesn't want you to speak to her. And we should listen to the majority. And all of you are encouraging this drama? We cannot stop this either, ma'am. The elections are around the corner. You cannot upset the voters. Will I get more votes if I visit the graves of those 14 children? After this incident is over, let's build a memorial for the children. We will get the public's sympathy along with their votes. No, ma'am. -The children are also important... -Enough! Listen. Let's be practical. If I talk to her, she will let two more children go. And we will find out what her next demand is. Or else we risk losing another child. Who is this? Sir! Sir? Sir! Dheeraj! Patch this call right now! Come on. Fast. Hello. Hello? Hello, Naina. This is Maya Rajguru speaking. Hello, ma'am. I am sorry that you have to speak to me under such circumstances. You created these circumstances, Naina. What did you want to talk to me about? Tell me. Ma'am, as promised, I will let two children go. I can let the others go too, ma'am. If you come here and speak to me face to face. Make it fast, ma'am. The traffic in Colaba gets worse in the evenings. The metro and flyover construction has been going on for ages. The children are also tired. Thank you. Hey! Have you lost your mind? What game are you playing? You want to sit face to face with the Prime Minister of India and want to discuss things with her over tea! I voted for her. I have the right to speak to her. I also voted for her. Millions of people voted for her. You think everyone can join her for tea and biscuits. She has to, Inspector Khan. The children are still with me. Don't forget. You can keep your suggestions to yourself. You have one hour. Look, Naina... Naina! F**k! Search the house thoroughly. -Lokhande. -Yes, ma'am? Akbar! Get me access. Yash, Dhuni... Teacher, where's Aakash? Aakash is sleeping. Okay, listen. Your mom and dad are here. Yeah? Pack your books. Let's go. Ma'am, I got access. Yes. Tell me. What? Okay. I'll be there. Ma'am, take a look. It is a booking invoice for a meditation centre in Igatpuri. Search the name of this medicine. Ma'am, we have leads on Rakesh and Charan from the BWC School. -I'll go and take a look. -Keep me updated. Okay. Ma'am, these are antidepressants. I found the pictures of Naina's mom from her house. She is at a meditation centre in Igatpuri. I have informed the teams there. I found pills in Naina's room. Antidepressants. -How old are they? -They were bought recently. This means Rohit is hiding something from me. -Sha, listen to me. -No, Rohit. You listen to me. I want my son, and I want him out right now. God-damn it! She is not answering my call. Don't you understand? You scoundrel! You think you are a great lawyer! Rohit! Why did you hide her illness from me? Answer me! Why would I hide anything from you, sir? -You are lying to me! -No! Why is she taking antidepressants? Answer me. She was taking them 5 years ago. We found some pills in her house that were bought recently! You lied to me! Answer me. Sir, I don't know about these pills. Trust me. I don't know. Naina couldn't cope with her dad's death, sir. She went into depression. She started going to therapy and... That's when she started taking antidepressants, sir. But that's the thing of the past, sir. For the last five years, nothing of the sort has happened. That's all I know. She is finally happy. We are happy, sir. We are going to get married, sir. That's all I know. These are the scanned copies of the medical bills for the last 15 years. What's the doctor's name? Ma'am, Dr Juneja's name is on all the bills. BD Juneja, Dr Juneja... Hello. I want the details of all doctors who go by the name Dr Juneja. Dad, I am trying my best. I need to talk to the person who's in charge. Yeah. Door! That's my son! Go ahead. -Yes, sir. -Javed. I spoke to the PM. She won't agree to Naina's demands. Sir, that girl is capable of anything. Inspector Khan, this is the secretary. Diffuse the situation now. You have the support of the PMO. The commandos are on standby. Sir, there are children inside. We cannot use force. Hello... F**k! Naina. The PM has refused to meet you. Please don't take any drastic steps. Don't do anything rash... Kaizan, come here. Come. -Shall I take your picture? -Yes. Yeah? Okay. What do we say? -Cheese! -Cheese! Our respected Prime Minister has refused to meet me. You will see three faces in my next post along with a poll button. You decide who lives and who dies. Our respected Prime Minister refused to meet me. Come on. Block the video. You will see three faces in my next post along with a poll button. You decide who lives and who dies. Prakash! Who decided that I wouldn't meet Naina Jaiswal? Ma'am... Ma'am, we did what we felt was right looking at the situation. This situation will never end. The Home Minister and NSA Chief also said that we should take action immediately. That's why you decided that the PM wouldn't care about the lives of 12 children! It's not like that, ma'am. But in such situations, you tend to behave emotionally because you are... Go on. Say it! Say what you wanted to say. Because I am a woman! A mother! -A grandmother! -No, ma'am. That is not what I meant. That's exactly what you meant! If you are not emotionally invested in the matters of your own country, there is no point in working for me. Emotions can be an asset. You'll learn with age. And don't you ever override me! I am not a puppet! -Yes. Tell me. -I found two Dr Junejas. Okay. Send me their details. Yes, Lokhande. Tell me. Ma'am, I found Rakesh Mathur. Okay. Send me the location. I'll be there. -Okay, ma'am. -Okay. Sir, Naina couldn't cope with the death of her father. She went into depression. She started going to therapy and... That's when she started taking antidepressants, sir. Good Lord! This is gold, Shalini. I think we should break this news immediately. I am ready. I am not moving. This is my segment. Of course! Of course, darling! Come here soon. Listen. Cut this recording and save the therapy dialogue. Play it in every break. Move! Sweetheart, it's all yours. Kill it. Okay? Lights. Going live in 5, 4, 3... I don't know how to introduce myself today. A fortunate mother whose son was released from the playschool! Or as Shalini Guha, the reporter from PNBC news who was waiting with other parents with bated breath hoping that our children would return to us safely. I've stumbled upon a piece of information that will truly shock everyone. I got this information from my childhood friend. I got this information from Naina Jaiswal's fiancé. I got this information from Rohit Mirchandani himself. Cue the recording. Listen. Naina couldn't cope with her dad's death, sir. She went into depression. She started going to therapy and... That's when she started taking antidepressants, sir. Did you know she has anxiety? As we all heard, Naina Jaiswal is mentally unstable. She is suffering from mental problems such as anxiety and depression. But today, this madness has taken over her. And she took Aakash's life. He was an innocent child. It could have been my son Yash. Naina, I know that you are watching me right now. You are listening to me. As a mother, I have some questions. Do you have the courage to answer my questions? Use the graphic of the child now. Quick. -Naina is calling. -What? Shalini, we have a caller. I am patching it through. Just tap the table if you copy. At least tell her that it's Naina. Get out! Out! Now! Ladies and gentlemen, we have a caller. Hi, this is Shalini Guha. Who am I speaking with? Hello, Shalini. Naina here. What do you want to ask me? Hi, this is Shalini Guha. Who am I speaking with? Hello, Shalini. Naina here. What do you want to ask me? You know this is the first time that I am live on TV. I finally understood why people look so confused. Everything works on a 7-8 second delay. It's like the delay between the government and the police. The delay between the police and newsmakers. The delay between the newsmakers and the public. During which, people like you, spice up the news and ruin people's lives. Naina, we are just stating facts. You termed anxiety and depression as insanity. How is it a fact? Your own fiancé called you crazy. What is the meaning of this online poll? Isn't this madness? You got the prime time slot of a big channel. Why are you asking such childish questions? Your poll didn't get a single vote, Naina. The citizens of India have united today. They don't support this game of yours. Nice! Didn't I tell you the entire country is running on delayed mode? Can't you see how much the public is enjoying this? They are playing the game of death. Didn't you take advantage too? I let your son go. That's why you got the prime time slot. To increase the TRP, you have called a person who is undergoing therapy "crazy". I didn't call you crazy. Your actions have proved it. Really? Now, you will see just how crazy I am! Hello! Naina? Hello! Shalini, we are still live. For God's sake, stop blanking out. Say something! I don't have any words left. A chameleon like Naina might change her colours. Who leaked this news to the media? Let's join hands and pray for those kids. -Over there. -Okay. Come on. Kusum Jaiswal? Hello. Yes. We found Kusum Jaiswal. We are bringing her to Mumbai by a chopper. It will take maximum 45 minutes, ma'am. Okay. Good job. Okay, listen. Get all the clearance from ATC. You cannot trust the rains in Mumbai today. But I need her here now! Okay. It's nap time. Who wants to listen to some good music? -Me! -Me! Okay. I want to hear it too. Come on. Put on your headsets. Very good. Lie down. I am going to play some really nice music. No cheating! Look. I put her and a kid as an option too. But this country didn't like your face. Ma'am, let me go. Ma'am... Ma'am! -Ma'am! -What is it? Bathroom... -What? -Bathroom... -Bathroom? -Yes. I want to go to the bathroom. We've heard another gunshot from inside the playschool. Did Naina Jaiswal kill another child? If the police cannot handle this situation, is it time to call the commandos? This wasn't my fault. I told him about the public poll. He tried to escape. Look. I am fed up. I am very frustrated. If the PM doesn't respond, I will kill the three of them. If you do it again, I will really kill you. -It's your thirtieth birthday. -What should we do today? It calls for a small celebration at least with friends. -Teacher, where is Aakash? -Is someone making you do this? What's this, ma'am? What are you doing? There are children here, ma'am. It's from Rohit Mirchandani himself. Why Javed Khan? Ma'am, why are you doing this? I didn't call you crazy. Your actions have proved it. Aakash is sleeping. Don't kill me. It's my birthday today. Now, you will see just how crazy I am! Mr Mirchandani, I have seen you on TV so many times. That's fine. I am going to say this to you, officer. You cannot hold my son here. He is neither the kidnapper nor the accomplice. -What? -Accomplice. The one who helps the criminal. Huh! Sir, just for my information, who is the criminal here? -Naina Jaiswal. -How is he related to her? -Fiancé. -Correct. So, sir, he has helped the kidnapper by withholding information from the authorities that she is on antidepressants. And that Mr Mirchandani makes your son an accomplice. Shall I explain it to you in Hindi, sir? Put it on speakerphone! -Hello. -Hello, sir. I am calling from Andies Cake Shop. Your cake is ready. When should I send it? -Hello, sir. -I... Yes. Please. -Cancel it. -But, sir... Her birthday is tomorrow, right? Yes. -So? -We were going to celebrate her birthday with a couple of friends. Exactly my point! Now, you think an accomplice could plan a kidnapping and a birthday at the same time! Should I call your superiors? Or is the law enough? Sir, I have a direct line to the Prime Minister of India. If there is anyone who has a higher authority than her, call them. -Listen, you just cannot... -Shut up! I gave you enough respect. I think you should order the cake. Both father and son can eat the cake together. Kids, wake up. Look what I brought for you! -Yes! -Yes! Come on. Come here, Niharika. Come this side. Come on. Okay. Let's go. -Happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday to you! Come, let's cut it. -Happy birthday to you! -Blow the candle. Happy birthday, dear Niharika. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! -May God bless you. -Bless you. May God bless you. Happy birthday to you! -Happy birthday, dear Niharika. -Happy birthday, dear Niharika. -Happy birthday to you. -Happy birthday to you. -Happy birthday to you. -Happy birthday to you. -Happy birthday, dear Niharika. -Happy birthday, dear Niharika. -Happy birthday to you. -Happy birthday to you. Yes. What do you say? Lokhande! -Did you find him? -Yes, ma'am. He is at the paan shop. Take a look. Okay. Go this way. -I'll flank him. -Okay, ma'am. Let's go. What kind of a friend are you? I'll pay you later. -I said I would pay you. -Rakesh Mathur. -Who is it? -Your father! -How dare you! -Why did you run? -Why did you run? -Ma'am... -Why did you run? -Ma'am... Why did you run? Motherf**ker! -Ma'am... -Take him away. Put him in the car. Ma'am, are you all right? Okay. -Hello. -Hello, ACP Alvarez. Dr Juneja speaking. I just got your message. Doctor, I hope you've been made aware of what's happening with Naina Jaiswal. Sorry. I was at a conference. I just got the information. It is truly shocking that Naina would do something like this. It is what it is. We have to do something soon. Could you tell me why she was on antidepressants? I have been treating Naina since she was 16 years old. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sir, Naina's mom is here. Okay. Everybody, come here. Everybody, make a circle. Those bad people have come back again. But don't worry. I'll handle them. If you stay quiet, I will give you a lot of chocolates. -Yes! -Shush! No noise. Shush. No noise. Come on. I am sure you know why your daughter is doing this. Sir, do you really think that everyone who knows Naina is involved in this situation? You left the city at the right time. Hmm? Now might as well tell me. What do you know that we don't? All right then. The commandos will go in shortly. Nothing will happen to the kids, but I promise you that I won't even let you cry over your daughter's dead body. I won't cry over Naina's body. My tears have dried up, Javed Khan. Because somewhere you are also responsible for this day. It's me... Jaiswal case... Case number 122. Goregaon Police Station. 2007, BWC School. Yes, sir. I know it is a high profile case. Don't worry, sir. The whole force is working on it. They will be caught soon. Yes, sir. Thank you. Sir, Case 122 is come again. Not again! Send her. Come in. Sit down. Sir, my husband is now no more. How many times do I have to come back here? I am tired, sir. We are trying our best, ma'am. Sir, it's been two and a half years. Now, we cannot catch any random person and bring them forward, ma'am. Then please find Rakesh and Charan. Please apprehend my daughter's rapists. Did you find my daughter's rapists? This... Javed! Javed! Javed, listen. Dr Juneja told me that Naina was raped as a child. BWC School rape case, Naina Jaiswal. We were assigned that case. 2007, case number 122, Cathy. Na... Naina Jaiswal. Yes. We just remember the case number. Case number 138. Sugar King Bhosle, shoot-out case. It was a high profile case. We wanted to make a name for ourselves. That's why we got busy with that case. Do you remember? We earned that name, Cathy. But we neglected a child's trauma because of it. Today, I am responsible for whatever Naina is doing. This is absurd. How can the Prime Minister of India succumb to the whim of a crazy woman? Do they know something that we don't know? Why is she even here? It seems Naina Jaiswal has forced the Honourable Prime Minister to give in to her demand. For how long will we continue to give in to the demands of criminals like Naina Jaiswal? Ma'am, Naina's IP address is back online. -We are trying to hack in. -Copy that. I am coming there. Ma'am, Inspector Javed Khan. He is the person in charge of this operation. Javed. Ma'am. What's the plan, Inspector? Ma'am, before that, you need to know something about Naina. Tell me. Write these two names properly. Rakesh Mathur and Charan Kumar. Now, we cannot catch any random person and bring them forward, ma'am. Please apprehend my daughter's rapists. Did you find my daughter's rapists? Yet another victim of our system. All this is happening because of that. Call her. -Hello. -Hello, Naina. I am outside. I know, ma'am. Thanks to our live media. Come in. Naina, you know this is not possible. Then why did you come here? To show people how much you care about an ordinary citizen! No. I care about those 12 children. The police force, commandos, public, no one trusts you, Naina. -What about you? -How could I? You've killed a child. Hold on, ma'am. Hello. Naina! Hello. She has opened the door. Shekhar, that's Aakash! Can we play that game? -The shooting game. -Yes, teacher. I will play. Don't move at all. I will give you lots of chocolates. I promise I won't move. This is breaking on PNBC. As you can see, Aakash is not dead. He is alive. He was just released. Do you trust me now, ma'am? That I am not a murderer. I just want to talk to my Prime Minister face to face. That's all. Naina, I will come in with the PM. The hostages will be released, and we will talk after that. One more thing. Your mother is with us. Inspector Khan, the time for negotiations is over. You can keep my mom. No. I didn't mean that. Your mother told me everything. What happened with you... Whatever happened... Everything. Did you find Rakesh and Charan? Rakesh is in custody. We are looking for Charan. He will be found. Naina... -Naina. -Fine. You have to do something for me. This will be my last demand, Inspector Khan. Savitri, are you all right? Sav... Savitri! Tell me. Where are the children? Are they in front or at the back? Sa... No... Savitri, tell me. -Where is Naina? -Naina... -Naina... -Savitri! You are all right. You are safe. Nothing will happen to you here. Ma'am, please take a look at this. Just wait. Savitri, you are fine. -Stay here. -But, ma'am... That's an order. Javed. We don't need to do this. Put the gun down. Naina, you got what you wanted. I am here. Where are the children? They are safe. They are locked in a room inside. Ma'am, once we finish talking, you can take the driver and the children. Please, ma'am. This way. Sir, please save me. -Sir, please save me. -Please have a seat. Sir! Sir, help me. Yeah. Sir, help me. Sir! Sir, please save me. Sir! Ma'am, she has logged into her bank account. Ma'am, click on the send button. What is this? This is the list of NGOs for rape rehabilitation victims. The 50 million was for them. Ma'am, she is transferring the money. Should I stop it? We have to take a call right now. -Ma'am. -Don't stop the transfer. Let it be. Is this why you did all that? It's just a start. What do you want? Capital punishment for rape. I've studied law, ma'am. I know that you alone cannot pass such a law. But a convicted rapist can be hanged to death. You can help by passing such a law, ma'am. Naina, you know it's not that easy. Why don't you say that you will not do anything about it? If you talk sense, you will get a sensible answer. Do not forget who you are talking to! Yes. You know about POCSO Act. The Protection Of Children against Sexual Offenders Act, 2012. You took a step in the right direction. But why was there an age limit? Girls as young as 8 months to women as old as 70 years have been raped! As per official statistics, one woman is raped every 16 minutes in India. Official statistics, ma'am. Unofficially... Their blood doesn't run in their head, it runs elsewhere. That's why you have to instil fear in their hearts. So, all I ask you is to give me and the women of this country something to hold on to. I admit that what happened to you was an injustice. But what you are doing with these children today, isn't that injustice too? People in this country pretend to be deaf. Unless you don't yell into their ears, they conveniently choose to ignore. I am a woman. I know exactly what you are saying. But do you know what it feels like, ma'am? Do you know what my parents went through? My father... I... Even today, when Rohit hugs me, it takes me a moment to feel it's okay... It's safe. Then, I think that if he ever found out about it, he would leave me. Some people manage to get a hold of themselves, ma'am. But the rest, they hang themselves. Do we victims deserve only a f**king candle march? I completely understand, Naina. But what did these children do wrong? Today, had I not used these children, the police wouldn't have arrived so soon. Javed khan wouldn't be here. You wouldn't be sitting here either. Nor would Rakesh Mathur have been caught. And he wasn't even the man who raped me. What? Then why Rakesh? I can never forget Rakesh's face. He... He pinned my hands down. His big eyes kept looking at me while I was being raped. Naina, I promise you. I will find your rapist. That won't be necessary, ma'am. He is sitting right behind you. Do you remember? BWC School Bus! You would never find Charan Kumar because he has been with me for the last 9 hours. Three weeks ago, this animal holding Niharika's hand entered my playschool. He tells me, "I'm Niharika's new driver." I... I just froze, ma'am. What if someday he... Charan Kumar managed to change his name and live a free life. I didn't have a choice. I could not let him walk free. Again! Isn't it Niharika's birthday tomorrow? I will order cake and snacks. Don't worry. Is it okay to just... for your driver to bring it over? -Naina! -Ma'am, she is talking nonsense. She has lost her mind. -Sir! Please, sir... -Shut up! -Tell the truth. -I didn't do anything. Naina, you know the law doesn't work on feelings. But you do. That's why you are here. -Naina, don't do this. -Tell the truth. Did you rape me or not? Naina, don't do it. The commandos will be here in a flash. Please, Naina. Did you rape me or not? Naina, I will get you justice. Let me help you. Calm down, Naina. Let the law handle it. It's you who will die, not me! Level one clearance. Take the shot. Secure the PM. -Don't shoot! -Secure the PM. -Secure the PM. -Drop the gun. -Drop the gun. -Don't shoot! -Don't shoot! -Hold your fire! Hold your fire! You are overly dramatic! What? Why? Salute the people who deserve it. For the last 20 years, your gun's safety was off. But today, it was on. My mistake. Fine then. You may as well write the incidental report. Cathy, take care of yourself. -Good night, ma'am. -Good night, Javed. I stand before you today not just as your Prime Minister but as a female citizen of this country. I would like to say something. The proposal in front of you can change the lives of the millions of women in our county. Honourable Speaker, this is about everyone's self-respect. Even if you are a man, this is about all the women who are a part of your life. Your daughter, wife, sister, mother, it could be anyone. Was Naina Jaiswal right or wrong? Not just the parliament, the whole country is debating about it. She is paying for what she did. The issue that she took up wasn't wrong. History is witness that a lot of great men and women have broken the law. Be it a queen who stood against tyranny or a man who walked for kilometres to lick a grain of salt. That's why I just have one request. Don't let Naina Jaiswal's demand fall on deaf ears. A THURSDAY WHEN INDIA WOKE UP Good morning, class. Good morning, teacher!
