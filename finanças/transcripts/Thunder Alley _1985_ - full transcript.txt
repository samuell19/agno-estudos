Mornin'. There's coffee on the stove, Richie. I'll fix you some breakfast. Oh, I'm not hungry. You gotta eat somethin'. Maybe later. I want you to go in town and pick up some grease for the cotton pickers. I'm really beat. Can't it wait till Monday? You should've thought of that when you stayed up half the night playing that guitar. It's Saturday, Jesse. He's been workin' with you all week long. It ain't a nine-to-five job. You want that kind of job, you go out and find one. Yeah, but he's gotta have some free time-- I don't wanna argue about it. That machine's gotta be lubed today. I can't do it without grease. Hey, one pot pie to go. Hi, Richie. Hi. What are you doin' in town? Oh, I had to get some stuff for my dad. I haven't seen you in weeks. Whatcha up to? Oh, workin' mostly. What a drag, huh? Well, it beats pickin' cotton. Oh, maybe, but at least you can't eat cotton. I bet you I put on ten pounds since I started workin' here. You look okay to me. Well, my boobs got bigger. At least that's what Donnie says. I guess you should know, huh? Yeah, I guess so. Where is Donnie? Went by his house. His van wasn't there. Oh, he's in Thunder Alley. The band's auditioning for the Rat Trap. They found a new guitar player, huh? Mmm-hmm. Some guy Skip used to play with up in Phoenix. You ought to go down there and check 'em out. Yeah, maybe I will. - How much? - It's on the house. Yeah? You sure? I'm sure. I'm just promoting the product. It's good business. All right. I'll see you later. Okay. You tell Donnie to call me, okay? All right. ♪ Do you feel all right? ♪ Do you feel all right? So, what do you think? I'll give you two days next week. If the kids like it, we can talk about more. Two days? What the fuck is two days? It's better than a sharp stick in your eye. Hey, where'd you come from? The lonesome guitar strangler! What do you say, bud? Come on, give us your best shot. Come on, right now. Come on. -I'm here. -Come on. -Come on, bring your lunch. -Hey! How'd you find me? What about Mr. Freezy? "Mr. Freezy"? What do you think? You guys sound good. Who's your new guitar player? Skip got him. He thinks he's hot. But see, I think he's shit. And you know something, buddy? I think you should be up there. Skip don't think so. Hey, well, what does Skip know? He just shakes his ass and sings. He thinks I'm a hick. You are a hick. But you're the best damn guitar player in town. Donnie, I wanna get out of here. Will you give us a hand? Hey. In a minute. Come on. So, listen. I'm gonna come downto the Palace tonight. You wanna go? I don't know. You know, you are really becoming a spud head. Give me a break. I've been working. Come on. I'll pick you up at eight o'clock. -Okay. -All right. Call Lorraine. Did you see her tits? They're Nortons, man. You could use 'em for Buick headlights. You're an animal. Yeah. Rock and roll! They're gonna put you away, boy. I hope they do, buddy. Real soon. If Hannah doesn't pick this year, then it's good for us, ain't it? That depends on whether we can handle the extra work. What about that fellow in Yuma? He was willing to team up with you. Maybe. I gotta go. -Who is it?-Donnie. We're going into town. -You need some money? -No. -I'll try not to wake you up...-Hey. What about my pie? Night. Looking good. Want any? Are you gonna get crazy? Probably. I got it. -I've never seen it this crowded. -What? It's crowded. I know.It's been like this all summer. I wanna play here so bad, buddy. I can taste it. Who's the band? Surgical Steel. They're from Phoenix. They're not that good. Hey. Let's go find the girls. What girls? What do you mean, "girls"? Lorraine's got someone for you. Why didn't you tell me before? 'Cause you wouldn't have come. Damn right, I wouldn't have. Donnie, I don't like blind dates. She's not blind. That's not funny. Hi. My name is Brad. What's yours? Brad. Take a hike. Hi. My name is Brad. What's yours? You're late. I know. We got hung up. Richie, hi. He's a little pissed off because we didn't tell him about his date. Oh, no. Richie, you're gonna like her. I swear. What'd you do with her? She's in the bathroom. She'll be right back. Well, look, let's go dance. You'll be okay, huh? What do... What do I say to her? Look, just don't talk about agriculture. That's funny, Donnie. Her name is Beth. It's really funny. Are you Richie? -You're Beth. -Yeah. Lorraine's out there, dancing. I know. I see her. So, you're a friend of Lorraine's, huh? Yeah. -I hear you play guitar. -Yeah. I feel really stupid. What? I said, I feel really stupid. Me, too. So, I... I thought the machine or something was busted. But I guess he didn't believe me. Because when he opened the valve, the seal or something must have broken, and ice cream shot all over the place. He was covered from head to toe in three different flavors! Are you cold? No. I always do that when I feel good. I should get going. It's getting late. -I'll get Donnie. -Well, that's okay. I just live a few blocks on theother side of the riverbank. I can walk. I'll walk with you. How come you don't play in his band? That's a long story. Is it because... you and Skip don't get along? Well, that's definitely one reason. What's the other? Those guys are really committed to music. I'm not sure that's what I want. What are your choices? Well, my dad kind of expects meto take over his business. And my mom's been pushing me to go back to school and... What do you wanna do? You sure ask a lot of questions, you know that? I'm sorry. But I was just thinking... if you're as good as Donnie says you are, it seems like a waste not to take a shot at it. This is it. Pretty crummy, huh? I had a nice time. Yeah, me, too. You're fun to talk to. So are you. You get in this house, girl. I gotta go. We weren't doing anything. Like hell you weren't. It's not what you're thinking, sir. I ain't blind! Please, Daddy, don't-- You get your ass in the house, now! I was just walking her home. That's all. You get off my property, you hear me? Or I'm gonna call the cops. Now! He's an asshole. I don't understand. We weren't doing anything. Well, he beats her, I mean, you know, she came by and she showed Lorraine her bruises. I mean, you're lucky he didn't kick your ass. Did you know that she's half-Indian? Lorraine met her mother and she's a full-blooded Navajo. You like Beth, don't you? She's okay. Hey! Where's the band? Come on, give us some music! I knew he was gonna drink too much. Fuck! What are you guys doing? They're screaming for you. It's that new guitar player. He's passed out in the shitter. Skip talked to Fatman into coming down here to check us out. He is sitting up there and he's waiting for this next set. If he likes what he hears, he'll book us into the Palace. What are you gonna do? We only got one shot, buddy. You are gonna sit in with us. Are you crazy? I don't know the arrangements. Look, you can fake this better than that guy can play sober. -What about Skip? -I'll handle Skip, okay? Just do this for me, Richie. Yeah, you gotta do it, man. What the fuck's going on here? -He's sitting in for Jimbo. -Like hell he is! This isn't a country and western band. Hey, he can kick-assrock and roll, and you know it. Jimbo's the guitar player in this group. Hey, I don't give a shit about Jimbo! - We have to do this set. - Hey! Hey... I can do it. All right, but you better not fuck up.

The fucking Palace. You guys already got a lead guitar player. -He's outta there, man. -And you're in. We all agreed. -Even Skip. -Come on, Richie. Look, you can't sit in that barn practicing the rest of your life. This is your chance to find out if you really wanna rock and roll. I don't know. I don't know! All right, look. Well, make up your mind, okay? Because we gotta bein Albuquerque by Monday night. And that's three days from now. Think about it, Richie. What's wrong? I'm sorry about tonight. I let Lorraine talk me into it. It wasn't fair. I put you on the spot. It's not you. I'm glad you came. Will you walk me to the door? What about your father? It's okay. He's not home. Yeah. Will you write me? What makes you so sure I'm going with them? I watched you tonight, Richie. You're good. Really good. I was so proud of you. The way you play, it makes people feel good.

But you understand that he's not keen on this guitar thing. He gave me my first one. I know. But we never thought it'd come to this. We sort of figured it like a hobby. Does that mean I can't go? No. You can go. All right! But on one condition. That you start paying your own way around here, and that includes room and board. Agreed? Huh! Agreed. Understand something, honey, it isn't the money. What's important is that you get a feeling for what it's like to earn a living with that guitar. -That's fair. -Well... You better start packing.

It's Fatman's idea. He's like a road manager. Yeah, well, I don't like it. First we gotta rent an extra van, and we gotta carry this guy and it's all coming out of our money. It's business, Donnie.We're not playing high schools. Yeah, well, I still don't like it. Well, why don't you tell him? Here he comes. Let's go. We're running late. Come on. You really told him, Don. Check it out, guys. Stand back. Big time, here we come. Okay, listen up you guys. The guy that owns this place is a real prick, so you let me do the talking. Hey, come on, we've handled club owners before. Let's get one thing straight, right now! You work for the Fatman, this is his deal. I'm here to make sure nothing fucks up. Now you play the music, and I do the talking. Understood? Good boys. Let's rock and roll. So, that's how you spell "Magic," huh? I'm joking, okay? I know how to spell it, all right? I'm joking. I want 45-minute sets. You start cutting 'em short,and you're out and you're axed. Now, just so we understand each other... I think this kind of music sucks. But the kids like it, and that's what pays the bills. But if I gotta tell you more than once not to play so loud, you're in deep trouble. What about fringes? There ain't any. No free drinks and no drinking at all unless you're old enough. And no drugs in this club. I've got you put up at a first-class motel. You wanna party? Party there.

I like that. You sure you can't play another week? Yep. Well, I run a top club. Lot of groups got their start here. Yeah. We got other bookings in the corner. Well, that's too bad. What is this shit? What's the matter? Right amount, ain't it? It's the right amount. It's the wrong way. Meanin' what? Meaning, we get paid in cash. That's the deal we made going in. Yeah. Well, it's been a slow week.

That's great. Because you know why? You're not gonna sing it. Richie's gonna sing it. Oh, great. What am I supposed to do? -Come on, Skip. -This is bullshit. It's the perfect song to open with. -It's bullshit. -Hey, what's going on? Yeah. As if you didn't know. You open the show, daddy-o. What are you doing? Look, it's a great song.

I don't know. I've heard about the Fatman's parties, I never expected nothin' like this. Let me give you a little advice. Don't trust him. I've seen guys like Skip and Donnie before... He eats 'em alive. What do you mean? He's been straight with us. Put us on the road to see how we do, then he booked us at the Palace. He put you on the road to get you out of town, Richie. 'Cause you guysare better than Surgical Steel. That's why you went on the road and that's the only reason. Why are you telling me this? You guys are special. I'd like to see you make it. Thanks. Yeah. Be good. Donnie wants me to go skinny-dipping with him. -Are you? -Are you kidding? With all those creeps out there? Besides, I haven't seen him in over two weeks. Who knows what I might do if I get naked in the pool with him. Hey, guitar man. I saw you play tonight. You're hot. Thank you. Wanna come here and cool off with me? Uh, I'm with somebody.

Oh, he's with the Fatman. Donnie's been acting weird since I joined the band. You know how some people just know... what the other one's thinking? That's how it used to be with us. It's not like that anymore. People change. Everybody's got their reasons. My dad used to take mefishing here when I was little. I'd do belly flops from this rock. My job was to scare the fish in his direction. It's kind of hard to picture you and your dad fishing. He wasn't always the way he is now.

Now, Donnie's been shooting his mouth off all over town and I don't like it. God damn it, boys. He getting to be a pain in the ass. He doesn't show when he's supposed to.

By your glorious power, give him light, joy, and peace in Heaven, where you live forever and ever. Amen. Give him eternal rest, O Lord. And may your light shine on him forever and ever. Amen. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Oh, God. Donnie... Man, I hate funerals. Richie's taking it really bad. God damn it. I don't know what we're gonna do without old Donnie boy. We don't have time to work in new keyboards. Richie's gonna have to take up the slack. I don't know. He looks pretty freaked out. He'll get over it. Your mom said you were out here. I've been worried about you. I talked to Butch, he said the rehearsals sounded good. It's not the same. I know it's not the same. It's hard. I know how much you loved him. I hate him for what he did. Yeah, it's a green truck. Thank you. Thank you, I appreciate that. What happened? He's a fucking lunatic, that's what happ-- Why don't you just shut the fuck up. Richie flipped out. He'd been drinking all night on stage, they took a break, I come back here, and he's beaten the shit out of Skip. Why? Skip said something about Donnie. How they're playing just as well without him. Fuck you! You fucking bastard! Look, I'm sorry, all right? Fuck. Where is he? Uh... He, uh... He left. He left with a woman. Look, Beth, I'm sorry, -I never-- -It's okay. I don't own him. For a while there, I didn't think we'd ever connect. It was worth the wait. What is that? Relax. Trust me. I guarantee you like it. I never had any complaints from Donnie. You gave that to Donnie? The first one's always free. After that, it's strictly COD. Where did you get that shit? No, you goddamn-- Where? Where? Come on, come on, come on! Say, maybe we'll go get a big steak, huh? And then, swim over at my house, okay? We got company. Get rid of them. This is between you and me. Hey, what the fuck is this all about, Richie? Huh? You stupid son of a bitch! No! What the hell do you think you're doing? That's my car! Stop it! Where the-- Wait a minute. Just hold on now. Stop it, or I'm gonna cut down your ass! God! Are you nuts, Richie? Why are you doing this? Settle the fuck down. What the fuck-- Ask Star. She'll explain it to you. You stupid fuck! You can forget about the Rainbow Festival! Shit! Good afternoon. Hi. Richie around? Richard! Somebody here to see ya! Heard about last night. He's not gonna press charges, though. I don't think he wants to make a big deal out of it. I didn't figure he would. You, uh, talk to Beth yet? You know, she showed up last night. She knows all about it. You really hurt her bad, Rich. Look, you didn't come all the way out here to talk about Beth and me. What do you want? Okay. Fatman tore up your contract. He's gonna keep Skip around, try to work him into Surgical Steel after the concert. But you and the others are out on your ass. It's a tough break for Wolf and Butch, isn't it? There'll be a lot of record company people there. I'm not interested. Well, I can arrange for you to play that concert tonight. There's gonna be a lot of people backstage. They won't even know what's happening. As soon as Surgical Steel finishes their set, you guys can come on when the lights are out. No. Wireless guitar, mic and a backstage pass in there. -I'll make sure the amps stay high. -I told you. I'm not interested. Richie, you know I'm putting my ass on the line here. You understand that? If Fatman found out about this,he'd tear up my contract, too. Don't do me any fucking favors. I ain't doing you any favors! Boy, you got the talent to go places. And I can help you get there. We got a future together, but you gotta want it. I don't. Hey. You know, when I first met you, I really thought you were something special. I guess I was wrong, huh? Guess you were. Shit! Here. In case your boy changes his mind. If you wanna pull this off, you better get here now. Everything's set. Weasel just called and said he's on his way. It's about goddamn time. All the way out here I rehearsed what I was going to say. And now, I can't remember any of it. Why haven't you called? I didn't know how you felt. At first it hurt. I cried a lot. When I couldn't cry anymore, I tried to understand why you did it. I thought I meant more to you than that. Beth, I'm sorry, I was screwed up. Were you ever gonna call? Or are you just gonna end it like you're ending it with the band? There is no band. Why? Because Donnie is gone? No, 'cause I don't wanna play anymore! You're scared. Aren't you? Ambition and talent, one's no good without the other. You and Donnie, depending on each other. Only he let you down, didn't he? And now you feel guilty because you hate him for it. -That's not it. -Then, prove it. Look, I don't wanna play the concert and I don't wanna talk about it! What do you wanna talk about? What's important to you? Is it friendship? What about Butch and Wolf? Don't they count? And what about Donnie? It's his music, too, and if youdon't play it, no one's ever gonna hear it. Is that what you want? To bury the music with Donnie and his memory? Is that idea of your friendship? God! Can't you get it through your fucking head? I'm not gonna play anymore. Just leave me alone, Beth. I loved you. But right now, I can't think of a reason why. If Surgical Steel gets the recording deal, we can tell the lead singer. Look, Skip. Why don't you just let me worry about that. Say, uh, just go get us all some drinks, okay? Hey. These guys will be done in about 20 minutes. Soon as the lights go out, you guys hit the stage. Hey, where are you going? Gotta make sure everything's set. Have fun. What's the bet the show's a regular with a couple of real assholes out there. Won't be the first time. Very funny. You're a very, very funny man. What happened? Nothing. You mean, he's not gonna do it? No. I don't believe it. He won't even do it for you? He told me to leave him alone. You okay? What about Wolf and Butch? I didn't have the heart to tell them. -Where the hell have you been? -I had some business. You had business? Yes! Let's hear it for Surgical Steel! Thanks a lot, good night. We love you. -So, how did I do? -Who cares? Come on, boy. Well, now what do we do? What is going on? Who let those jerks out there? It's nuts, man. He's not gonna show up. If this was your idea, Weasel, you're fired. Come on, let's get out of here. Son of a bitch! Yeah! It's him! Jesus Christ! He's there! Hey, he's good, isn't he? Yeah! Come on! Glad you could make it! I'm putting an end to this shit right now. You go out there, it's the lastthing you ever do, you fat fucker. Come on!
