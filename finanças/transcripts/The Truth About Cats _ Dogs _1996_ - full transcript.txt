Thank you. Wait, wait, wait. Oh, great. Thanks. Excuse me. Don't touch that dial. It's not Texaco's hour at the Metropolitan. It's Dr. Abby Barnes with "The Truth About Cats & Dogs" and you're on the air. - Hello? - Hi. Oh, hi. This is Charles from San Pedro. And, okay, my question is I'm worried about my basset hound, Clothilde. - She doesn't wanna seem to eat. - Doesn't wanna eat. Well, you know what, Charles? Usually, Basset hounds don't wanna eat what they can't smell. - Does she have a cold by any chance? - Oh, she is coughing a little bit. Okay. Is it a dry, wheezing like... ...type of cough, or is it a wetter, phlegm-based cough? It's like the first one, more like the wheezy one. - Okay. Can you put her on? - The dog? On the phone? - Yeah. - Okay. Clothilde, come here, baby! Come here. Okay, here she is, Doctor. Oh, baby! Yeah, she's got a cold, Charles. You're gonna have to take her to the vet. - Right now? - Right away. - Yes. Hello? - Hello? Yes, my name is Dan, okay? And I have a cat. And he licked up and down my face, and now I got this awful-lookin' rash. You see what I'm sayin'? - You're allergic to his saliva, Dan. - No, no, no, I'm not. I mean, you know, I never have been prior to this occasion is what I'm talking about. But you're saying he licked your face and now it's all gross, correct? - Well, yeah. - Okay. How long did this tongue-bath last? Well, let's see, it started at 1:00... - About three hours. - Oh, Dan. No, no, it doesn't seem to hurt him any. Right, because that's... he's a fur person, Dan. He chases imaginary bugs up the wall. Are you gonna do that, too? - Imaginary? No. - No, no. Okay, this is a good time to talk about limits. You can love your pets, but just don't... love your pets. You know what I mean? Repeat after me. Us, them. Hi, babyhead! How are you? Wanna come read with me, huh? Sweetest of all possible sweet cats in the world? Huh? Huh, sweetie? I think we're gonna paint this weekend. Yes. You're going to paint, and I'll watch. Now you can watch me read. Well, can I have a kiss? You didn't kiss me when I came home. Kiss. Thank you. Thank you, my lovely. Noelle? Down the hall! Come on, baby, open up. - It's me. - Ass. What an ass. - You're not Noelle. - Not today, no. But try again tomorrow. Who knows? - You might get lucky. - Is she... I mean, is she... Over here, Roy! Aw, man. - Sorry. - It's okay. Hello. My fish, he's depressed. My vet said to bring in a blood sample, so I tranquilized him in a 10% Diazepam solution, but he's not moving now. And I wanna know if you think I should take him out. Absolutely. You're sedating him, not poaching him. You gotta get him out of there. We're gonna take a little break, and then answer some more of your calls. Don't go away. - Ready? - Bring it on. Fan mail, fan mail, fan mail, horse too fat. - Oh, my God. - Bad dog, mad dog, sad dog. - Stinky cat problems. - We're back in 30, Abby. Thank you. Oh, my gosh. Hey, hey, Mario. I know her. No, you don't. Women like that don't really exist. Yeah-huh. This one exists in my building. Abby, you've got a caller on line 3 who says his dog is hysterical. Hi, this is Dr. Abby Barnes. You're on the air. This is Brian from Venice. Hi, Brian. What's up? Well, I've got a dog here that's a bit out of sorts. Mm-hmm. And what's wrong with your dog? This is gonna sound strange... He's wearing roller skates. I see. And how did your dog end up in roller skates? Well, actually, he's not my dog. I got him from the pound this morning. I'm a photographer and it's all part of this shoot that I'm doing. I thought you said this guy was a professional. Oh, no, no, no. He is a professional. He's just used to dealing with Chihuahuas and poodles. It's the dog that's unprofessional. Everyone, it's gonna be fine... if we all just stay calm, okay? You've got to help me here. All righty, let's help the dog first, and then we'll help you. Right now your dog is feeling very, very threatened, so if you wanna get close enough to take the skates off, you're going to have to approach him in the submissive position. - I'm sorry? - Get down on all fours. You want me to help you, you have to do what I say. Okay. Okay. All right, now crawl toward him with your head hanging down and cocked to one side, and do not make eye contact. Don't make eye contact. Okay. - Okay, how are you doing? - He seems interested in me. Now, you have to make him feel comfortable. You're gonna have to soothe him with your voice. You hear how I can make my voice sound very, very soothing? Yes. Good boy. Okay, now reach out your hand with your fingers curled under like a paw and try and touch his coat. Shit. Jesus. Are all your digits intact, Brian? - Yep. - Okay, now move forward. Just gently stroke his ears, putting pressure at the tips. That's an acupressure point. Okay, just take it easy. You're doing good. Okay, careful. Go for the ears. - Go out to the tips of the ears. - Okay. Gently. Okay? - That sounds good. - It's incredible. Good boy. Thank you, but we'll be leaving now. Oh, no, no, no. You don't have to leave. You've gotta understand what these dogs are getting paid. They're in the union now. They're hard to work with. - We appreciate the opportunity. - Can you leave the child? - No, I don't think so. - You can't turn your back on art. Let's get these things off you. Who put these things on you, eh? Brian, I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate you on the newest addition to your family. What? No, I can't have a dog. - Well, why is that? - Well... Well, I live alone. Trust me, you're gonna like this a lot better. - Maybe, but it's a big responsibility. - Is that a bad thing? No, not necessarily. It just depends on what you want. He's a big dog, which is gonna take a lot of... Give Eric your name, and we're gonna send you some pamphlets on canine dental care. ...which I obviously haven't got time to do if I want to... - And, Brian? - Yeah? I forgive you. Yo, come on, man, let's roll. We're ready to roll. You've got the shot. You've got millions of shots. No, I think this is better than the thing with the boy. So, what are you gonna do? You gonna meet us over there later? Yeah, maybe. I don't know. I've got to make him his dinner, then get his bed ready, and then I don't think he should spend his first night in a strange place alone. - Do you? - Don't get too attached to this dog and get weird on me, all right? And plus, his mouth is all juicy like his gums sprang a leak or something. It's meant to be juicy. They dribble when they're hungry. Hank. So what do you think? What would a girl find more romantic... tulips or roses? - Well... - Forget it. Susan will know. - A messenger just dropped this off. - Thank you. - And line 2's for you. - Thank you. - What? - What's more romantic... tulips or roses? Oh, that's so cute! This is Abby. - Hello, this is Brian. - Yes? We slept together. Me and Hank. Did you get the picture? Yeah, yeah. I'm looking at it right now. - He spent the night. - Oh, that's so great. How's it going? Yeah, well, he snores, which was a problem. - But we solved it. - How'd you do that? Well, he slept on my face and I couldn't hear him anymore. That's a good solution. I'm glad he decided to keep you. Yeah, so am I. I just wanted to say thank you. Oh, you're welcome. It was my pleasure. And I'd really like to say it in person. How about you meet us for a drink? Um... Or a walk, a walk along the canals. Why would I meet a listener I know nothing about except he puts roller skates on his dog? Good question, good question. Well... I didn't want to say this upfront, but I've got this really bad case of mange. And it's terribly itchy, you know. I just can't stop licking it. - Oh, hmm. - So, I was wondering if you could recommend an ointment or at least have a look at it. What the hell? Okay, how about the Washington entrance at 5:00? - Great. Well, I'll see you there. - Okay. Me, too. Great. Okay. Bye. No, wait, wait. I forgot to ask you what you look like. Why do you need to know that? Just so I can recognize you. Oh. What do you think I look like? I don't know... if the voice is anything to go by, you look great. I'm 5'10", blonde, thin... hard to miss. Okay. I'll see you there. Okay. No, you won't. Can we just go? Just go back inside and change your dress, please. I look fine. Your friends aren't gonna complain. What are you doing? You look fat. No, come on. Don't be like that. Let's just go. - Noelle, shut up and get back inside. - What are you doing? - Get back inside. - Look, I've already changed my dress three times, and I just really... No, I know, but you look fat in that thing. So go in and change the dress, and do it now! - Roy... ahh! - Dumb bitch! - Did you call me? - What? I'm sorry, I heard "dumb bitch." I assumed you were speaking to me. No, I'm talking to her. You're kidding. Your name is Dumb Bitch, too? No wonder I've been getting all your mail. Do you think we could be related? Because there are a lot of us dumb bitches here in LA. Hi. Hey, cat lady, mind your own business. Why don't you leave before I use this bow on you in a way you've only imagined? Here. Imagine that. You know what? You're not just a dumb bitch, you're an ugly dumb bitch. Oh. And you... later. Wow, that was... I don't know what that was. - You all right? - Yeah. God, I'm sorry about the violin thing. I'll buy you another one. - That was your boyfriend? - I go out with him. The thing is he's also my manager. You pay him 10% to treat you like that? 15. Hey, he says that's normal. I don't know. He used to be sweet. What are you supposed to do? I mean, you gotta have a boyfriend, don't ya? Otherwise it's just you and a cat, and the next thing you know, 40 candles on your birthday cake. - What does that mean? - Oh, no! - No, I didn't mean you. - Forget it. This is absolutely none of my business and I will not be interfering again. Sorry. I didn't mean you. Do you have a computer yourself? No. My husband does. And he's on the thing all the time. He doesn't even play with the kids anymore. What does he do with the computer? - She's right over here. Okay? - Okay. Uh-huh. Hi. Did you know violin bows were like cars? Meaning? Well, they go from your basic low-end bows... something like a Geo or a Hyundai, which I personally drive, all the way to your high-performance Porsche-like bows, which play like the devil. I... I got you this... well, it's like a Toyota, which was all I could afford. Aw, thank you. Just give me some time and I'll upgrade your bow. Don't worry about it. It wasn't your fault. This is really nice. - Wow. - Yeah. You wanna sit down? - Can I? - Sure. - Promise not to laugh? - Sure. I'm taking broadcasting lessons myself. That's great! Newscasters... you know, they're so dignified. They always know everything. Yeah, it's the news. They get the information beforehand. No kidding. That's why it's so cool. You find out before everyone. - Usually, I'm the last to know. - Oh. Hey, how about you play hooky and we go score ourselves a cappuccino? All right. That sounds pretty good. These are leaking on me, though. I'm gonna get a vase. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Come here, come here. Let's go. Testing. Good evening, Riverside. This is the news at 5:00. Okay. Hey! I know that dog. I don't think he likes me. Can you get him away? Come here! Hi, sweetie! Why do I know you? Why do I know your sweet face? Oh, my God. Oh, my... Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Um, um, um... you have to help me. There's a guy out there and I was supposed to have a date with him, and this is his dog. And I just want you to be me when he comes in here, okay? Sorry. He ran in and then the door was locked and... - Sorry. - Brian, right? - Yeah. Hi. Abby? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. It's lovely to meet you. You, too. This is my friend, Madon... - Donna. - Hi. Hello. Hank. You didn't show up yesterday. No, I'm sorry. We had this emergency thing, didn't we, Donna? - Yeah, cat emergency. - Dog... it was a situation. - Feline panleukopenia. - It happens, but it's okay now. - What? - Nothing. Sorry. It's just you sound completely different on the air. Oh! You should hear me in the shower. Microphones, darling... they work wonders. Yeah, I've heard that. I just didn't want you to think that I was some weirdo. Oh, no. And that's why you didn't come yesterday. It's just that what you said to me on the radio was so clever and perceptive. And if you hadn't said what you said, then I wouldn't have kept Hank here. And... I just wanted to say thank you. - That's so great. - Yeah, that's great. Thanks. I've taught him a trick. Do you want to see it? Mmm. Okay. Come on, Hank. Up you come. Yes! Good boy. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss, come on. Come on. Yeah, I've gotta do something about his breath. Anyhow, I don't suppose you want the drink now? - Guess again. - Great. How about tonight? There's a bar on the corner of Main and Pier. Meet me there 7:00? Wild horses couldn't stop me. See you there. Come on, Hank. Come on. You like him and he likes you. - Don't pretend you don't. - I don't! Did you hear what he said to you? I wish a guy would say that to me. - He did say it to you. - No, he really said it to you. And now you've gone and confused everything 'cause you're a scaredy-cat. I may be somewhat trepidatious, yes. I'm not some big, dumb dog that goes bounding after the first guy she sees. - I'm not dumb. - I didn't mean that. - Besides, you're the dummy. - I am? Yeah. A nice guy like that with that accent, arty, and you won't even have a drink with him? You. Then he sees me. Over. I love the way you look. You've got a pretty face. - Oh. No. - You're a celebrity. I don't expect you to understand this. You burp and guys think it's adorable. You puke and they line up to hold your hair back. I can tell you for a fact that's not true. Whoo hoo hoo! Nice trick, moron. - What? - "What?" Oh, my God! Really? Three years, no sex? One can survive, you know. This is the electronic age. But even cats have more sex than that, don't they? Not mine. Are you gonna eat that? I don't eat. You don't eat? You ordered it. I love to order, I love menus, but I gotta keep the calories down. - God, how can you live like that? - I know. - Do you believe you are what you eat? - I guess. See, that's what scares me. I don't eat anything so I can look good on the outside. But on the inside there's nothing. Oh, I see. Whereas you, on the other hand... you're very rich. Thank you. - Do you hear a bzzing? Bzzz? - Just a bee. Is that a b-bee... bee bee bee bee! - Aah aah! - I'll get it. Aah! Hey! Hey... What are you... You! Stop! It's dead. No kidding. - I killed it. - You certainly did. You're gonna be all right now, so... She's fine. We're fine. Everybody's fine, right? Great. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. What's wrong, Abby? Nothing that a rooftop and an AK-47 won't take care of. - You okay? - Mm-hmm. Good, good. It'll be fun. It'll be easy. No problem. - Hey! - Don't want to see him. Come on. - It'll be fine. - It's not gonna be fine. It'll be just fine. What is this? Is this cat hair? I'm shedding. I'm extremely nervous. Okay, just head up. Be proud. - Feeling good. - Yes, sir. This makes all the difference. Thank you. - Hello. - Hi. - Remember? - Hi. - Donna. - Right. - I'm gonna go and, um, freshen up. - Okay. Oh, and Donna's got this loopy story to tell you. Actually, it's funny. Maybe you can help her with the punch line? Okay. - I'll have a J&B and a Corona. - Okay. Can I have a J&B and a Corona, please? - Sure. - Thanks. Of course. Of course I would do that. So, what's the funny story? Oh, I don't know if it's funny so much as interesting. Men and women and how they interact. We have societal pressures and even the media feeds into it and we have our own insecurities, me especially. You have a little fuzz. - Got it, got it, got it. - Thanks. - So, you're wondering why I'm here. - No. I mean, y... no, not at all. I mean, I think I know why you're here. - You do? - Mm. And it's fine. That's great, 'cause I was... I think it's really nice that you've come along to screen me for Abby. Abby. Right. There's a lot of very odd people around, particularly the types who phone into radio shows and then ask the presenters out for a drink, which is honestly... it's not something I normally do, but... - I really like this woman. - You just met her. I know, but you know when you speak to someone, and then you meet them? And then there's really no choice. Nothing you can do about it. You just feel it. So what do you do, Donna? Do you work at the radio station? - I make cheese. - Cheese? - Yeah. - Really? I've never met a cheesemaker before. So, what sort? Goat cheese. Oh, that's the stuff that smells of vomit. - No, that's Parmesan. - Yeah, of course. Mine's more of a fromage, really. And it comes from the south of France, the Pyrenees, where I have acquired a number of goats through a freakish inheritance. Occasionally I'll take trips out there and sometimes Abby accompanies me to check on the general health and well-being of my goats. - Really? - Yeah. - Hi. - Hi. Everything out in the open? Oh, you mean about? Yeah, sure. Totally understandable. You see? She thought you'd be all bent out of shape about it. Not at all. I think friends should look out for each other. Although, flying across the Atlantic to check up on her goats is... You know, when you come with me to check on the goats for the goat cheese that I make for a living. Her cheese balls make excellent Christmas gifts. - Here we are. - Great. I don't know... I was mesmerized by his eyebrows. They say so much about a person. Did they say "goat cheese" on them? Why didn't you just tell him? I don't know! I was staring at him. He was so uninterested in staring back at me. I don't want that kind of disappointment. Disappointment doesn't kill. Right. Rejection kills, disappointment only maims. Okay, here we are. Just go through. - This is it. Château Brian. - Nice. Hi, baby! Ooh. The dog really likes Donna. I can't seem to get ahold of him. He's just jealous. Dogs, they can sense... you know. - Really? - Yeah. Oh, are these yours? Yeah. Don't look at those. They just pay the rent. There's not a lot of art in a catalogue shoot unless roller-skating dogs qualify. Dada meets Fido. That was funny. - Roller-skatin' dogs. - Hey! - I'd like to see that. - Hey, look at these. - These are beautiful. - Yeah, but they don't pay the rent. Hmm. What do you think? Ask Donna. She knows more about this arty kind of stuff. Brian, this is a beautiful shot. - This one? Really? - Yeah. Yeah. I love those textures right there. Yeah? That's one of my favorites. Yo! Can we come in? Of course you can. Ed, this is Abby. - Hi, Abby. How are you doing? - Hi. Abby. - And Donna. - How are ya? Yeah, all right, all right. Oh, this is my niece, Emily. What? Oh, yeah. You can ask her yourself. - Is it okay? - I forgot to ask. Ha. Hi. What is it, sweetie? Aah! Oh. - I'm sorry. - No, it's fine. When they heard that there was gonna be a real vet in the house, I just assumed they could come over. - That's a really beautiful tortoise. - He's got pneumonia. - Aw. - Yeah, we took him to the vet and he gave us this hypodermic full of antibiotics. We're supposed to give him a shot underneath his arm, but we can't seem to keep him out of his shell. So we were thinking that you could help us out. Sure, you can. You can do that. Of course. Um, let me just go wash my hands. Donna? She is all that and a bag of chips. - Who's the other one? - She makes cheese. - I hate needles. I hate turtles. - Shh! Why don't we just tell him now? He was definitely into you when you were talking about his photographs. He's amiably tolerating my presence till he can be alone with you. Now, all you have to do is grab the turtle's leg, hold it steady, and give the shot. - How do I get ahold of his leg? - Very simple. You're gonna poke him in the butt with your finger. You want me to stick my finger up a turtle's ass? Hey, what's this? Your palms, they're sweating. - Malls make me nauseous. - I did the turtle for you. Yes, you did, and you did a brilliant job. You and I combined make the perfect woman. No, you and I combined make the perfect political prisoner. What we really do well is act self-righteous and starve. - Hello. - Hi. Okay. We need the spring-bride blush and the Absentia pore minimizer. I'd actually like a pore maximizer if you have one, because sometimes you just wanna put loose change somewhere, or keys. There's this TV station in Riverside. They're looking for a weekend anchor. They've asked me if I'd audition for them next week. That's so cool! That's great. Would you listen to my audition piece? - Yeah? - Yeah. 79 people drowned and another 200 were in... Wait. Okay. Just cool. Okay. 79 people drowned and another 200 were injured when a passenger ferry caught fire last night just off the coast of Scotland. Stymied by a dense fog, rescuer workers could only hear the desperate screams of the victims as their four-mile journey turned into a tragic and watery end. That was good. That was really good. But you might wanna make the carnage a little less upbeat. Oh, I know. I just get tense and I... You're right, you're right. No, it was great. And you might wanna breathe more. This is nice, but it's a little bit smelly. We also have this new face cream which neutralizes the free radicals - that attack the skin. - Ooh. Let me ask you... what's your skin regime? - My regime? - Mm-hmm. The regime from which the radicals are trying to get free? Are we selling face cream or staging a coup? Let me show you something. Do you see how dry and discolored you are? Do you see the irreversible sun damage? You haven't been taking care of your skin, and it's only going to get worse. God, I can't believe it. I can't believe I let her do this to me. I know exactly what she was doing. Shit. Do you have a tissue? I think she might have put one in the bag with your gift-with-purchase. Oh, God! Men don't go around buying all this expensive crap, hoping women will want them, you know. If I was a guy, I think women would be lining up to go out with me. I'm smart, I have a good sense of humor, I make a great living. I'd fuck ya. Thank you, honey. I know you would. I'm just confused. One minute she's one thing, and the next minute she's something else completely. Yeah, but women are like that, though. No, but I mean there's something off-balance about her. On the radio she's confident and articulate. And then you get her in person, and she's just... I don't know... she's scatty. - Oh, she's scatty? - Yeah. Anybody that fine... it doesn't make any difference. - Yes, it does. - I'm telling you, it doesn't. You know what your problem is, right? You're letting your brain do too much of your thinking. I've got something for you. "Loser Guys and How to Spot Them." Are You a Victim?" - No. - Wait. Question one: "Do you feel you need to be punished for how you look?" I don't need to be punished. I am punished. That's why you can't tell Brian. It's low self-esteem. I don't even care about Brian. That is history. - I think it's more of a current affair. - What does that mean? Last night before we were leaving, I told him to call me. To call me? You gave him my number? - Your number. - Why would you do that? Why did you do that? You like him. You like him. - I have a boyfriend. - Oh, right. Who'd want Brian when you could have Roy? - Here you go. - He likes you. You know, the way you talk, the things you say. - You're the voice. I'm just the body. - And what a body it is. Hello? Hello, this is Brian. Could I speak to Abby, please? This is she. - What are you up to? - Nothing. Just hanging. Well, listen, I was thinking maybe I could come round and take you out for dinner. How does that sound to you? Oh, that's not possible. Right. Go for a walk? Sorry. Can't do that, either. Well, how about we just talk? Talk. Okay. Fine. Let's talk. But could you talk to me in that radio voice of yours? Could you do that? Yeah. - Yeah, that I can do. - Great. You know what kills me about him is he just lays there and lets me rub his stomach. He's totally trusting, knows I'm not gonna hurt him, loves me unconditionally. That kills me. People are never that cool. No, they hardly ever let you pet their stomachs. Mm-mm. And I really like smelling his cat breath when he yawns. - You think that's weird? - No, not at all. I've done the very same thing... probably... once. Your voice is muffled. What are you doing? I just took my shirt off. - Really? - Really. Is that portentous or merely noteworthy? It's rank, actually. I went for a run earlier and I have this remarkably manly, animal-like, pungent stench. Look, I know we're not eating or walking, but what would you say to having a bath? - I was shy, too. - You're kidding. You don't strike me as the shy type. No, I was, really... painfully and desperately shy. And thinking about it, I suppose that's why I ended up taking pictures, as sort of a detachment thing, you know what I mean? Ah, yes. Oh, he knows you're talking to me. He's probably jealous. I doubt it. Salt, pepper, granulated garlic, mayonnaise, of course. Of course. Now for the important question: Do you have a position on pickles? It's more of a deeply held belief, actually. Oh, really? A pickle conviction? - Mm-hmm. - Go ahead. When it comes to tuna fish, I am emphatically anti-pickle. Hmm. Do you know, I knew I could trust you. "My mother leant herself to the photograph." Fearing that refusal would turn to attitude, she triumphed over this ordeal of placing herself "in front of the lens with discretion." Now you. So, you are? Yes. Are you? Yeah. Say something. I want to make love to you. Sorry. Never on the first phone call. No, don't... don't do that. If you do that, we'll chicken out and we won't do what I think we're about to do. Okay, just let me do one thing. Oh, God! Okay, hi. Hi. Okay. So, where's your hand? It's nowhere. Where's yours? Nowhere. Wow. Hello? Abby? Abby? Abby? Hello? Sorry. Sorry. I dropped the phone. I was afraid you'd met somebody else. God. Just give me a second to collect myself. Man. I've never done that before. Me, neither. It's almost time for breakfast. - Yeah. - I wish you were here. - I wish you were here, too. - Okay. Brian? Brian. Brian! Brian, no! ♪ Pull over the car, pull over the car ♪ ♪ I think I see a five-fister ♪ ♪ Pull over the car, pull over the car ♪ ♪ My dad wants to break up with your sister ♪ ♪ I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna ♪ ♪ I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna, I don't wanna... ♪ Abby? ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah. ♪ - Abby. - Over here. - Hi. - Hi. Look, I brought some... some breakfast. - Can I come up? - No. Why not? Because first, it will be awkward, and then strange, and then weird and then awful. - What? - Tonight has been so perfect. Let's wait for another night to screw it up. Can I at least see your face before I go? No. I have a pore-minimizing mask on. Well, then, throw something to me. Throw something you've been wearing, and then I'll go. Wow, it's a Ked. - Will you shut up? - What's your problem? - It's 4:00 in the morning. - You'd better go. Okay. Good night, sweet Abby. Pleasant dreams. 79 people drowned and another 200 were injured when a passenger ferry caught fire last night just off... Sleeping here, Noelle. Can't you see I'm sleeping? Sorry, Roy. Sorry. Just off the coast of Scotland. Stymied by dense fog, rescue workers could only hear the desperate screams... I said shut up, Noelle! Jesus! - Hi. - Hi. I had the most amazing conversation with Brian last night. We spoke for about seven hours. - And I'm telling him today. - Seven hours. - What's wrong? - Nothing. What? Tell me. It turns out Roy is a loser. Tell me something I don't know. Oh, oh, I was kidding. I'm sorry. Oh, no, no. Don't cry. Oh. It's okay. You are no longer allowed to read this destructive literature. Don't read that. Oh, no. Please don't cry. You're okay. - How are you gonna tell him? - God, I don't know. I was thinking about it all last night. I just wish there was a way I could do it without actually having to doing it. - Is your show on today? - Yeah. I'll go to his house and I'll turn on the radio. And? Have you ever noticed how Superman and Clark Kent are never in the same room at the same time? Hi. Can I come in? Yeah, of course. Come in. - Oh! - Sorry. - So... you came over. - Yep. Last night was... - Yeah, it was, I know. - Wasn't it? So... Buttons? - What? - Sew buttons? - I don't... What? - It's nothing. It's just something my grandmother used to say. - Really? - Yeah. So... buttons... could I get you something to eat? - Tuna sandwich or something? - I don't eat tuna. - Yes, you do. You ate it last night. - I did? I did, I did. In the car, on the way over, I quit. - Dolphins. - Dolphins. Right. Well, there's plenty of dolphin-friendly food in the kitchen. - Good. - I'll be right back. Okay. Can I turn some music on? - Uh-huh. - Okay. - Okay. Bye. - Bye-bye. "Afternoon Becomes Eccentric." KRWW... talk radio and more. What do you think of that? What do I think? Yes. - It's nice. - Mm. - It's kind of dark. - Yes. You know, I was in a dark mood that day when I took that. If you'd let me, I'd really like to take your picture. Maybe tonight. Maybe. Or whenever. This stuff's left over from a shoot that I did. I hope you like sweets, 'cause that's all there is. Oh! I don't eat that stuff. I order it, but I can't eat it. Of course you can. You take it one bite at a time and it all goes down. - No. - No, really. - Mm. - Is that nice? Mm. Mmm! Mm. This is so good.

It's just that... no one's ever given me a book before that didn't have pictures in it. Well, I'm glad you like it. I love it. Wow, I mean... it's... - A book. - A book! It's funny how self-conscious we both are, considering... What do you mean, self-conscious? I mean, you have to admit you're not the same person you were on the phone last night. - That's true. - Why? Is it because we did? It's because I'm stupid. Well, me, too. Completely feeble-minded.

I can get you there in time. - It's... - I've got... - I've gotta tell you something. - What? - I'm... - What? I'm... I'm late. What am I doing?

Let's just see what they're doing. No! Let me. - Oh! - Give me that. - Shit. - Oh. I'm sorry. It's okay, it's okay. I can get another one. It's all right. Leave it. I can get another one somewhere. I think they still sell them in Bolivia. God, you should clean this place up. Oh. Thanks for the ride. Here's your button. So she's been licking her belly. Is she really sensitive in that area? - No, not really. - She's not sensitive in her belly. Sorry. Hey, on Tuesday's show I wanna talk about potbellied pigs. Come, come, come. That was scary. We started with the show on tape. It's okay. Uh, Abby? You're on in 60. Is it okay if I hang around and watch? No! - You need to concentrate. - You need to concentrate. You... you need to concentrate. - I need to concentrate. - Okay, I understand. - I'll see you later, then. - Bye. So I guess you didn't tell him. Take him. I don't want to fight. I refuse to degenerate into some misogynistic cliché. Having said that, how could you do this to me? I was gonna tell him. I was all set to do it. The show was starting and I just couldn't. - Why not? - Well, he wouldn't listen. - What was he doing? - Nothing. Then why didn't you let him find out when the radio show started? Maybe it was all the cake he fed me. What is that? The Twinkie defense? He gave us a book. Which one? Simon somebody's letters to John Paul somebody. Simone de Beauvoir's letters to Jean-Paul Sartre? - Exactly. - Aw! Don't you see? He said I was smart. Nobody's ever said that to me before. I just couldn't stand to tell him it wasn't true. Smart and beautiful, though, right? Okay, I've got two ideas how we can fix this. We find out how he really feels about us, but in a roundabout kind of way. So we go over to his house, and I just sort of casually ask him something like: If you were stranded on a desert island... - Trite! - Okay. If you were stranded in that bubble thing in Arizona... - Biosphere? ...who would you take with you? "Time" magazine's Woman of the Year or "Playboy"'s Playmate of the Year? I object to those categories on both our behalves. What's idea number two? We go over there, get shit-faced and see what happens. Okay. Hello. What...? - Not so fast. Hello. - Hi.

I am hammered. I gotta go home. Oh, I'll go home with you. No, you're having fun. He really likes you. What? What about you? No, I don't even... - You don't what? - Is everything okay? Yeah. I just remembered I have to be somewhere. - Secret rendezvous? - You know it. What about you? Are you gonna stay? Hi. My dog, Casey-Kay, she's getting kinda old and slow and just not what she used to be. And I was wondering if there was something... Right, so you're telling me she's no longer young and attractive, so you're seeking my approval to have her put to sleep? Well, no. Actually, I was gonna ask about vitamins or something... You know who I think should be put to sleep? People like you who only want cute dogs. And I hope that aesthetically unpleasant dog of yours bites you in the ass and moves on. - Wait a minute. You got the wrong... - Next caller. Hi, this is Abby. Please don't hang up. I hate hang-ups. Leave it. Good evening and welcome to the 6:00 news. Noelle Slusarsky suffered a major setback in her ongoing quest to become an adult this week when she tried to steal her best friend's boyfriend. Abby, please pick up if you're there. There's something I need to tell you, but not on the machine, okay? Okay, I'm going out of town on a job. I'll call. Hi. It's me, Noelle. Please pick up the phone, Abby. Abby? Okay, so you're not gonna pick up the phone. This is what I had to tell you. I didn't sleep with him. We started wrestling around and kissing, but he kept calling your name. "Abby, Abby, oh, Abby!" And I could hear it in his voice. He meant it. So, I stopped. I told him it was all moving too fast for me. And I haven't called him since. Hi. Did you ever look in the mirror so long that your face doesn't make sense anymore? It just becomes all these shapes. Just shapes. Not good or bad. Remember when he took our pictures? You looked really good. Did I tell you that? I'm reading two books at the moment, if you can believe that... the one that Brian got us and a dictionary so I can understand the one that Brian got us. I'm avoiding a guy who calls me "Abby" and I'm very frightened that I screwed up a friendship with the nicest woman I've ever met. When I come home, I'm gonna fix things. I'm gonna fix everything. I'm sorry. I just miss you. Hello? Hello? And deep cleanser. I really appreciate you taking this back. And I really appreciate your attitude taking this back. Donna. Donna. Donna. - Donna? - Hi. I was calling your name. Oh, I must be in a daze. I didn't hear you. Department stores. - I get that, too. - Yeah. - Sorry, you were buying something. - No, I was returning something. Oh. Well, I just bought a present for Abby. Look at this. It's a photo album and I had her initials embossed. See? Abby Barnes. - Oh, that's pretty. - Do you think she'll like it? - I do, yeah. - Great. Are you finished? - Mm-hmm. - Right. Can I walk you out? - Yeah. - Thank you. Did she tell you that she's not talking to me for a week? - Is that right? - Yeah. It's driving me mad. You see her all the time. I don't suppose she's mentioned anything about... Mm-mm, she hasn't said a word to me. No, of course not. I heard her on the air today. She was brilliant. - Brilliant? - Yes. Oh, that's a bit much, don't you think? Are we getting jealous? No, trust me, that's not even possible. You know, before I listened to Abby on the radio, I never really would have given a cat the time of day. I think I'm beginning to understand them a bit more. - Or maybe not. - Whoops. Well, you look like a cat-lover from way back. - Hi. - I think she likes you, too. - Do you know much about animals? - A little bit. Of course. You've got all those goats, haven't you? When you go to college, do you have this thing in England called the Freshman 10? - No, we don't. - Do they have that? It's traditionally where most girls who go off to college gain 10 pounds. - Although, when I went, I gained 40. - 40? 40 pounds, and I'm 5'1 ". So four times the required amount? So you can imagine how popular I was with all the 18-year-old boys. What has happened to me in the past is that I meet a woman... - Do you mind that I'm telling you this? - No, sir. I meet a woman I'm attracted to and hopefully she's attracted to me. And it's very exciting, and then I get to know her, and we have nothing in common. Or the opposite happens. There's lots in common, fabulous woman, but there's no excitement, there's no sparks. Okay, so say you meet one of these no-sparks women and you really take the time to get to know her, and then you become intellectually stimulated by her. You just really enjoy her personality, thereby igniting all your lust and passion. Have you ever thought about that? Are you going to eat that? - Are you cold? - No, I'm fine. You're shivering. Here, wear my coat. - So chivalrous. - Yeah. - Thank you. - Okay. Seriously. I'll just get the buttons. - Sorry. - It's fine. Your hands are freezing. Come here. Put them in the pockets. There's nothing disgusting in there, is there? Who did that? Who put that piece of chocolate in my pocket? You're missing it. Look. - Are you warm enough? - Getting there. Do you always watch sunsets with your eyes shut? - Yeah, it's kind of a religious thing. - Really? No. Do you know, if you listen very carefully, you can hear the moment when the sun hits the hills? Shh. Not today, obviously. - I'm having a... - What? - Nothing. I had a really nice time. - Oh, me, too. I gotta go. Okay. Okay. Thank you. - Thanks for the walk. - Thanks. Bye. - Donna? - Yeah? If you see Abby, tell her... tell her I miss her face. Yeah. Abby? Hi. I just need to talk to you. 10 minutes. 10 minutes. So we can clear everything up. 5:00? Your place. Great, great, great. All right. See ya. Bye. Aah! Jesus, you scared me. I thought you'd be coming from over there. - Mm-mm, I was watching you. - You weren't. I was practicing looking relaxed. - You looked relaxed. - Did I? You look gorgeous. - It's my job. - Is it? Speaking of work... This was a little bit too much for me. - Was it? - Mm. I had to read each page, like, three times. I'm more of a mystery kind of girl, or maybe a romance. I bet you wouldn't have guessed that about me. No, but that's okay. I mean, romance would be fine. Did I ever tell you I used to only date guys who couldn't speak English? I've missed you so much. It took ages to find out it wasn't working 'cause I couldn't understand what they were saying. - I speak English. - And then I dated this guy, Roy. - I hated everything he liked about me. - You have the most beautiful mouth. We have to stop. Abby, I love you. You love a girl I could never be. - You don't love me. - Yes, I do. I don't understand what you're saying. Just tell me what's going on. - You need to know. - Yes. You do. So make a list. Make a list of everything you love about me. A list? Oh, I gotta go. I have an audition in 20 minutes. - An audition? - Yes, for the news. I wanna read for the news. - What about "Cats and Dogs"? - The cats and dogs are covered. So make a list. Bring it. 5:00, my place. 79 people drowned and another 200 were injured... ...their four-mile journey came to a tragic and watery end. 79 people drowned and another 200 were injured... Abby? - Abby! - Coming. Hang on, I can't hear you. It's me. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hi. - Donna. Where's Abby? - She's not here. No, what are you talking about? I just heard her voice. I know she's here. Right. She's not here here. She's in the bathroom taking a bath. But I will tell her that you came by, okay? I've got an appointment. I don't know that that would be a very good idea right now. Uh, but I'll tell her that you're here and perhaps she will come out... eventually. It's Brian. He wants to talk to you. Tell him to come back in half an hour! I don't think he can be dissuaded. Tell him if he doesn't come back in half an hour, I will call the whole thing off! You're the boss. What did she say? She was acting so strangely before. - Is she all right? - She's a little bit out of it. - I think that she'll call you later. - Okay. Abby, it's me. I wrote down the things that you asked me to. Listen, could you do me a favor? She's worried that I don't love her, so... Sit down. You be Abby. - I'm Abby. - I've made this list. It's a sort of lover's list. Now, if I could just run it by you once to get a female opinion on it, then we can make any adjustments you think that it might need. Sure. I love the way you walk into a room and it lights up. I love your eyes. When they fix on mine, they burn into me, and I forget what it is that I wanted to say. I love the way we think of things at the same time. I love the way you make a tuna fish sandwich an event. The way you talk to me on the phone and... Shit, this is ridiculous. No, four and five aren't bad. You know, maybe she's right. Maybe I am rushing things. No, I'm not. Abby... I love you, because I can't stop thinking about you for one second, and because I stay at home every afternoon when I should be working, just to hear you on the radio. And because I want to read you to sleep every night and wake up to you playing violin every morning. And because you're so beautiful. You forgot to say, "I love you because you're so beautiful." No, I didn't. And yes, she is, but that's not why I love her. I love her for who she is. And if she weren't, it wouldn't matter. Of course it matters. It always matters. - No, the truth is... - The truth is Helen of Troy. - What? - Helen of Troy... men die for that shit. The truth is you would not be so enamored with Abby if she looked like... if she looked like... What? What are you talking about? Look, you know how someone's appearance can change the longer you know them, how a really attractive person, if you don't like them, can become more and more ugly, whereas someone you might not even have noticed, that you wouldn't look at more than once, if you love them, can become the most beautiful thing you've ever seen? All you want to do is be near them. I love Abby. It doesn't matter what she looks like. What's the matter? I'm happy that you said that. Well, I'm glad you like it, 'cause she hasn't said a word. It was you on the phone that night. Yep. That's your window... your violin. Yeah. And that's your cat. Hi. Is this a joke? It was a mistake. - Who are you? - That's Noelle. - Noelle? - Slusarsky. - Who's Donna? - There is no Donna. What is this? Is this some kind of weird game you two play for kicks? You pick up a guy together and see how much you can screw him up? - No, it was just a mistake. - A practical joke. - A joke? - No, no, no, not a joke. - Not a joke funny ha-ha. - Funny strange, if anything. No, I get it. You're a comedy duo. Actually, we never met until just... You're dumb and beautiful, and you're smart and... I have to go. Brian! He doesn't wanna see me. He doesn't wanna see you. Why did you send him back to me when you could have had him for yourself? I know you wanted him. Because I wanted my friend back. Besides, he's got this small personal habit that just drives me crazy. What's that? He loves you. - Well, how'd your audition go? - It didn't. Didn't make the cut. Still not dignified enough for the news. Well... they're looking for someone at the station. It's not the news, but I think it's interesting. - Are you serious? - They're expecting your phone call. - Thank you. - You should give it a shot. You should give it one more shot, Abby. Just go and talk to him, you dumb bitch. - I'm a dumb bitch? - That's right. Well, you're a dumb bitch, too, you know. Yeah, I know. We're related. Hi, sweetie. I'm glad you're here. Hi. - I came to return your jacket. - Thank you. You can just leave it on the stool there. I'm really sorry that I lied to you. It's just the situation got completely out of control. It's mentally exhausting, feeling really bad about something you can't do anything about. Right. That explains everything. - No, Brian... - What? What do you want? I want you to look at me. I'm looking at you. You know the conversations that we've had and the violin and the radio show and that incredible night on the phone? That really meant something to me. It was really important to me. But all of that stuff doesn't come in a perfect package. It comes in this one. Why didn't you say that in the first place? I didn't feel confident that you'd give me a chance. Now we'll never know, will we? - Okay. - Okay. I'm at the mechanic's and I'm getting my tune-up, and I look up on the wall and there she is looking back at me. But you know what tipped it off was when she was dealing with that turtle and she was like... That ain't professional. You're right. But then, we didn't have much to compare it to. Yeah, you're right, you're right. But you know what? It's not your fault, brother. I mean, who knew? My German shepherd is driving me insane. I left him home alone for one afternoon and you know what he did? - He peed on your bed. - No, in my bed. He peed in my bed. He took his teeth, pulled back the sheets first. That's very considerate of him, but are you sure that's all he did? Have you checked inside your favorite shoes yet? No. Hold on. I'll go look over there right now. Oh, my God! - Pinky, you're a bad, bad, bad dog! - Listen... ok... okay, listen. Don't worry about it. I wanna explain something. Dogs don't like to be left alone. It's not like when you leave, he goes "Great." Time to finish writing my novel." No. When their humans leave, dogs get depressed and they show it. - Yeah, in your shoes. - Mm-hmm. Listen, people are very good about hiding their misery. But your dog tearing up your apartment... he was trying to tell you something. What? - I wanna be with you. - You do? With me? No, I don't wanna be with you. What am I supposed to do about this dog? Am I just supposed to put on my poo shoes - and go out shopping? - I have absolutely no idea. Pinky, Pinky, you sit there and listen to the doctor! I have absolutely no idea what to do. - Wrap it up! - Oh, wrap it up! We're gonna wrap it up and I will talk to everyone tomorrow. I've been waiting 45 minutes! - Hi. Hi. Do you think he's here? - I didn't see him. He could be here, right? Okay. Stop. Please, please, please. Oh, my God! Whoa! Oh! Whoa. Okay, okay. Whoa! Oh! - It's cool, it's cool. - Sorry. Sorry. Okay? - Can I take these off now? - Yeah, of course. Over here. I'll help you. Thanks. - I'm fine. Thank you. - Right. Ahhh! Now, should I get down on all fours and then gently apply pressure to the tips of your ears? - I won't bite you. - No. So, is this humiliation on skates staged for your amusement, or am I missing...? No, no, of course not. I just wanted to get you out here in private to discuss a few things. The humiliation was just a bonus. What are we discussing? Well, there's the issue of Hank, who's in a terrible state without you. Weren't you, Hank? Hank. Come on, boy. Come on. Terrible state. Oh! Oh. No, this is beneath you. Never stoop. No, really, he couldn't sleep. And he kept me up all night, wanting to talk about why it took us so... why it took me so long to understand what was really going on. And then we wrote some extraordinarily bad poetry together. No, no, mine wasn't that bad. Hank's was... pathetic. And then we fought over which one of us got to carry your shoe around in his mouth. And... Abby... I only ever loved one woman, and I don't want to lose her twice. I gotta tell you something. What? That night on the phone? Yeah? I'm pregnant. Darling... Are you sure it was me? Actually, I don't know.
