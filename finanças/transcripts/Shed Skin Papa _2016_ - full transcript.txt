This is a story about a man who soared to the sky, and then fell to the ground. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama's funeral was just a few days ago. Looking at that man before me, I don't want to have the same life path as him. But I don't know why everyone says I look like him. I want a banana. - Because, - Banana. he's my dad. If he's sick, get someone to care for him. Don't let him out messing around like that. How shameful. So shameful. Maybe it's because Mama left him, his dementia got more serious. - Will I become like that? - Mama. - Have no one to rely on, - Mama. and have nothing left. [Shed Skin Papa] Sir! The pilot of the Tianlu Type plane is standing by. End of report. Every day, you pretend to be a pilot. Ready for takeoff. So annoying. My fellow soldiers are sending liquor. Are you Mr. Tin? Here's a registered letter. Damn you. Why don't you deliver all the mail at once? Do you want funeral money, Director Tin? Director. Sign this agreement. No cash? Repay me with your flesh. That's not good. If you really don't have money, cut out your organs and sell them. You can even help those in need. May I choose which organs? It's me. It's me. Find me a cheap funeral home. I'd be most grateful. Movies can make or lose money. Once your masterpiece comes out, we will make a comeback. You're just lacking a little luck. You can do it. I'm awake now. You can have a dream, but you can't just dream. You're so unlucky to have me as your partner. Don't say these things to me. You can do it. I worship you like my idol. And you talk to me like that? Sorry. - What's with your face? - It's special effect makeup. I'm planning a zombie movie, so I'm trying on some makeup. I'll wipe it off. Too busy? Why don't you open it? It's good that you came. I haven't cleaned up since we moved in, help me. You don't want to open it? How busy are you?! You need to shoot many films? Sign it. Let's go our separate ways. Here. I made a mistake. I signed your name. Excuse me. How many did you get? You know. There is something that I don't know how to say. Like what? It seems like if I sign now... Open the door. You're closer. Hello. I'm Elaine from Great World Funeral Home, here to follow up on our services. I saw you at the funeral home. - Is your father here? - He's sleeping. I'll explain it to you then. - Please come in. - What is it? Actually that day I had been observing your father, and have a perfect proposal for you. Please have a seat. I can start explaining now, right? - Sure. - Not a good time. Why don't you read these booklets first? We're discussing important family matters. This is important, too. The funeral home also has a senior home? Yes, for our widowed clients, who are now alone and has no one to depend on. We provide this support service. So, does your father live alone? No. This gentleman right here, will always take care of him. I'd like to ask about the times when you two are together. We don't need that any more. No. We will seriously consider your services. I can arrange a 3-day, 2-night experience Package for your father. Just sign here. Sign again? I always sign the wrong name. I have many copies. Don't worry about mistakes. We don't need it. It's all right. I'll leave these booklets for you to take a look. We don't need it. If you change your mind, contact me any time, thanks. Goodbye. I just want to pick an auspicious day. There are almanacs at the newsstand, I'll go get one. Funny. This nail clipper cannot cut fingernails, but so many fingernails come out of it. That's a stapler. Are you kidding me?! Again? Mama… Mama. - You're always like this. - Mama. Garbage. How could it possible to break off when it's that thick?! Mama… Mama. What's wrong with you? I'm taking a poop. Did your parents teach you to knock? Why didn't old man next door tell me that he is borrowing our toilet? Dad. What's wrong? The only Hong Kong female athlete is called Lee Lai-shan. [Idiot] Don't you know that? I only know Sarah Lee, everyone else is just garbage. Hong Kong athletes are not garbage. Kids, your mama is calling you home for dinner. - Old man, stop talking about my mama. - No fighting. - Don't talk about others' mothers. - He's crazy. Hong Kong athletes are not garbage. Lee Lai-shan. Not Sarah Lee. Remember that. Get up. Young people, you did very well. You stood firm on your beliefs, but in the end, you lost to me. Let's go, he's nuts. What? Did you see that? I alone lectured to these kids and convinced them all. Dad? Yes? Are you feeling okay? Do you feel anything wrong? You mean about my skin. People peel seasonally. Old folks peel from their hands and feet. Just this year I'm peeling a bit more, all over my body. I know seasonal peeling. I know sunburn peeling. But you're moulting. That's unique in all the world. I'll take you to the hospital. I can kill a tiger, why should I go to the hospital?! What are you doing? Are you afraid I'll lose my way? Why are you hanging on to me? You're no longer a child. Let go of my shirttail. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and hold. [Idiot] Cheung. Half a catty of roast pork belly, and a strip of barbecued pork. You pay, I am going to buy other things. Dad. He's a bit insane. Sorry. Weigh it up. Give me a bigger one. Add a pineapple. Thirty-five, forty-seven, sixty-two, seventy-five. - Two hundred and nineteen. - You're amazing. Give me a discount. - All right, 20% off. - 20% off is $175.20. Stop shopping, Dad. - Hung, you're brilliant. - Sorry. Ok, I'll stop. After this is enough. Give her $180 for me. Keep the change. You're so generous. Why don't you settle your old accounts? You owe her money? - No, you owe her money. - Do I owe you money? These are all your signatures. You have a lot on credit. A total of $2,568. I owe you that much? Hung, you do have money to pay for that, right? Give her $3,000. The few hundred extra dollars are interests. - Pay off this, too. - And this! I only have $98.90 at the bank. If you can transfer $1.10 to me, I can get $100 out. - No more shopping. - All right. I know everyone at the market. Ask Butcher Wing to come out. You guys are heartless. My dad passed away a few years ago. So you're Ribs Lin? You've gotten so fat that I can't recognize you. You were thin as a mosquito. - Now you're fat as a pig. - Sorry. Your dementia didn't make you talk sweeter. You're the one with dementia. I calculated faster than you just now, Pork Belly Lin. So you were pretending to have dementia? - When did I do that? - Sorry. - I don't have dementia. - Sorry. For the sake of your wife, I won't beat you up. That's right! Pay me back! Stay right here. What nasty people! - They used such a big piece of pork to hit the back of my head. - Let me see, don't move. - It's okay, I'm fine. - Don't move. It's minor, I don't need a doctor. No, I'll go home now. - I'm not sick. - Next, Tin Yat-hung. - Here, Tin Yat-hung. - I don't need a doctor. You are… I'm Tin Yat-hung. Just a checkup, right? - Yes. - A checkup is good. Wait for me here. - Where? - I'll take you over there. Let me help you. - I'm fine. - You lead the way. The nurse can take me. - Excuse me. - I'll take you. Nurses are so kind. This is a profession of merits. Hold your head straight. Sorry. What is it? You're taking advantage of me. You have to be responsible. Dad, sit down first, sit down. You drink and smoke too much, and sleep too late. Of course you'd have that heaty cough. - Fritillary illy and loquat stewed with snake bile. - Excuse us. - Right? - Be quiet, you. Nightlife is bad for kidneys, - and causes cold sweats. - Yes Don't say any more, okay? Boil rhubarb with sunroot and eucommia. - Yes. - This works so well. Hit your kidneys, left side... - Shut up. - It's not just talk. I want you to be quiet. Sit down, sit down. "Troubles come swiftly if you ignore elder's advice." Be quiet, okay? How is it, Dr. Chiang? The report shows that Mr. Tin's dementia is improving greatly. One can say he's younger by 20 years. Wait, he wasn't like that before. Is it dangerous that he's changed that way? I only have one conclusion for your father's disease. I'm really busy. - You brought me a different guy, are you trying to scam the insurance company? - Dr. Chiang… What are you saying? Who is trying to scam? Don't you recognize him? Look. He's a great director. - What is he trying to scam? - Get out. How much can it be worth? Next time, don't bring his younger brother. Bring him to see me. You've got so many problems of your own, how can you be a doctor? What are you doing? Collecting my skin to bring to the dump. You can't do that. Why not? It's your own skin. Exactly. Why can't I deal with my own stuff? Why not? - Why should I keep it? - Just no. Tell me why I should save it. For you to wear to Lan Kwai Fong on Halloween, to meet Western girls? Let me keep it for a movie prop. Movie prop. You don't have any movies to make. I told you to get rid of that thing. You've scared people. It's more scary if you throw it out. No, don't throw it out. Maybe it will be useful. - How? - How? Skin graft? You'd be the first person in the world to have spare skin. So what? Of course you use the new skin while you have it. Would you carry the old skin around? You idiot. I'm hungry, get me something to eat. What's this? You think I'm a monkey? Feed me? You loved it yesterday. You know, all these years, I've never tried my daughter-in-law's cooking. How about you cook us a meal? Sorry, Father-in-law. I'm done with this guy. Done with? What? He failed in his business. He's drowning in debt. And cheated with his university classmate. That doesn't count as cheating. Rekindled love, right? Call me when you've signed this. Honey. This is good. Father-in-law has a new life. Daughter-in-law. Chase her. What are you up to now? I should be asking you this question. Your home is full of divorce agreements. It's not that simple, right? Don't keep frowning. You'll look prematurely wasted. I can't be more wasted than I am now. I'm wasted as hell. It's only the two of us now. Vent your frustrations to me, son. Then we must start with Mama's feet. I was inspired one day, and made a 15-minute short film. 13 of those minutes are of Mama's feet, walking around the home. Surprisingly, it won an award. Your mother's feet were pretty. Lawrence Lau presented me with the Best Director Award. Hong Kong Youth Film Festival. You two treated me like a star. The Best Director goes to "My Mother's Feet", Tin Lik-hang. In a couple days, the whole community knew I had won. My hand was tired from signing autographs. But the Director Cut is of 980 mins. That long? It will take a whole day to watch. You can watch it yourself. I did well the first two years in Beijing. I thought I could be a director, who could make any film he wanted. The situation made me bold. I followed the trend and opened a company in China to capture that market. That is how I met Lai-wah in Beijing. But the reality was very different from the dream, my first commercial film, you won't believe this, broke the record for shortest theatrical run. We have no money to keep them. Tell them to go home. It died stone cold at the box office. No one dared to finance me ever again. I told Frankie to borrow money for my film. Action films were popular then, so we made an action film. Shot entirely in Taiwan. What are you looking at? Hurry, see if it's ready. Sorry, director. Bo, excuse us. Let's go. That cigarette was the start of the tragedy. Hi. What are you doing here? I have an artist agency now. Some of those are my actors. What a coincidence. No. It's just destiny, between you and me. In your deepest grief, someone came to comfort you and she was your first love. And... and she was on fire. That fire burned for 3 days and nights. All that was left of Taiwan film studio was coal. You got burned. Such a shame. You disgraced everyone. You deserved it. Sorry. What did you say? Are you even a man? You think a "sorry" will let you off the hook, and you won't be held responsible? Is that so? Sorry, don't just say that. Save it for a very, very, very crucial time before you say it, so it doesn't become a pet phrase. Didn't I teach you that? How did I get a son like you? You drove your mama to an early grave. Mama. You're up so early. Dad. Dad. Don't be so small-minded. Dad. No way. He's moulting once a day. Dad is moulting again. I don't know what is going on. He has disappeared. Call me when you get my message. Sir, we've banned smoking here long ago. Put out your cigarette, or come with us to the police station for a chat. A smoking ban? The British Hong Kong government won't let us smoke? - The British Hong Kong government? - You are invading... Sorry. Sorry, he's insane, he always talks nonsense. - Sorry. - Protest the British Hong Kong invading tax payers' rights! - That's enough. Sorry. - I pay tax every year. - Sorry. - I know what tax payers' rights are. That's enough. His idea of rights and interests is, he rules. Sorry. Keep a close eye on him if he's sick. Yes, sir, I won't let him smoke. I won't let him smoke. I'm sorry. Watch him closely. Don't tell me to see a dermatologist. You'll kill yourself smoking like this. Whatever. You don't know what happen tomorrow. One can't be sure about so many things. Get prepared. Who knows how the next moult will be? I'll smoke while I can. Then, while you're still young, finish the whole pack. I really must send you to a senior home, but they won't take you in like this. I may have to take you to kindergarten eventually. Do you remember we watched a classic match together? The National Team (China) versus Hong Kong. Yes. You want to tell me how great you were to get the tickets? There is nothing to brag about. I was working at an electronics shop. They were my boss' tickets. You stole them? You whined about wanting to go. If I didn't do this manly thing, how could I be your father? In the end, I worked overtime for a month to repay my boss. Your mama thought I was having an affair. Back then, watching soccer at the Hong Kong Stadium was so exciting. There were all kinds of foods. Ice cream man. Over here. Do you have frozen pineapple? Two pieces. Come on. - Take it, eat up. - Eat. You insisted on frozen pineapple that day. So cold. It was cold and sour. My teeth almost melted. If only we had... - Chicken feet. - Chicken feet. Braised Fai. Braised Fai, Braised Fai, come here, come here. Two spicy-sweet chicken feet. Here. Extra sauce. It's dripping. Back then, were we eating sauce or chicken feet? You had sauce all over your mouth at that time. It was all red. Wu Kwok-hung. Wu Kwok-hung. Twist. Pass to Wan. Wan Chi-keung Header, head it in. - Chu, stay on him. - Pass to him. Block him. Chu, block him. Plug up Wan's gap, don't let him in. Chu belongs to the National Team. Hong Kong versus the National Team, I support both teams. - Wan Chi-keung. - Wu Kwok-hung. Pass it to Wu. - Wu Kwok-hung, block. - Cross him. Cross-pass to Wan, great, shoot. Yeah. It's tied, zero to zero. Hurray. After zero to zero. The next round in Beijing was even more exciting. Which team won, Hong Kong or National? What was the score? I'll tell you after dinner. Mama! We're home. Mama, is dinner... When you came home exhausted after work, Mama would massage you like this. Does this get harder after moulting? It's so hard. Otherwise how can I support the family and raise you up? I'm not like you, running away from everything. You even attempted suicide. How did you know? I'm your dad, I know everything. Sorry. Can you kick that habit? "Sorry" is already a pet phrase for you. Just say "excuse me" for minor stuff. "Sorry" means you have to be responsible for it. You must change after you say it. Otherwise you will be sorry to the word "sorry". What's the point of that? As a person, you need to be borderline mean, but not really mean. Then others will respect you. Understand? Almost. Got it. Keep going, don't stop. Lower. Need a back stepping? Or scraping therapy? I've got some coins here. I can do a scraping therapy for you. You can save it for yourself. After the moult, things just don't look right. This home didn't look like this. The outside world didn't feel like this either. How long have we last cleaned the windows? This handle is broken and not repaired. Come here. Let's fix it together. - I'll pry, you turn. - Ok, go. Ready. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. When do you want to watch TV till? Have you finished your homework? Mama. I want to watch Gundam. I want to watch Gundam. I want to watch. [News] Do your homework. I want to watch Gundam. I want to watch the news, do your homework. I want to watch Gundam. You can't have what you want. Who bought the TV? If you're so great, why didn't you buy two, idiot? What did you say? I dare you, say it again. You! Stand here. Come out. You called your dad an idiot. You called your dad an idiot. Stop beating him. Who taught you that? Sorry. Your son said he's sorry. Come out. Is this yours? Is this yours? It hurts. You bought these porn magazines. You're giving your son the wrong message. I haven't bought it for a long time. I bought them long ago. I left them under the bed. I didn't know he would dig them out. Oh mine! Betrayed me? Messing with your dad. Both of you. Can't you behave a little? ♪ Thanks to that courage. Thanks to those arms of steel ♪ ♪ Into the sky I fly, fly, fly ♪ I'm making bamboo kneaded noodles, want some? Yes. Yes.

It's messy. Hope you don't mind. You two have a chat. Needs to be mean, but at the same time, not too mean. Was that your father? My younger brother. My father's younger brother. Things haven't changed much here. It looks the same as before. We used to sit here and watch movies. The masterpiece you made, "Bomb Girl". That was a long time ago. Those were good times. I remember you used to love to sneak into the film academy room to sleep. And I loved to, when you were talking about film, put my hand somewhere on you. Do you remember where? That warm place. I loved to put it on the back of your neck. What do you want? I am unlucky enough. I am fallen to the bottom. Leave. We were so happy to meet up in Taiwan. It was my fault. I was a mess at the time. I couldn't control myself. It was terrible of me. I beg you. Leave. Please go. It's so hot. When you're like this, everyone wants... Everyone wants what? Everyone wants to have sex with me? Not Frankie. You were looking for Frankie back then? You're jealous. Leave. I will go, after I offer incense to your Mama. Leave. Leave now. Hurry up. Open the door. I don't know how. You're kidding, right? Stop it. How's Dad? Where is Dad? Dad. Dad? Hi. Sorry for disturbing. By the way, when he was in school, he made a weird film, called something "Bimbo Girl". It was a musical film, "Bomb Girl". It was the fruit of our love. I'm committing suicide, go away. Really? She really is angry. I beg you, leave. If you don't go, even suicide won't help me. Nothing is my problem any more. Where is Dad? A dead body. It's a prop. A dead body. - It's a corpse! - It's a prop. Call the police. My phone. Please calm down. Where is my phone? What is it?

What did you do with your skin? Throw it out onto the street. You can't save it for clay pot rice. Even if it's just the skin, I won't let my dad be dumped on the street. Don't you get it? Your dad is here. What are you doing? Dad? Sometimes I really don't know what Lik-hang is thinking. Everything would be settled by just quickly signing the divorce agreement. You agree too? Reluctance won't bring happiness. You're so cavalier about it. That's great. Sasa, you're single, right? I have a son. You're married? I'm divorced. I wouldn't have known. Sometimes I really don't know what you two are thinking. The rascal Lik-hang is fine when things go his way, but falls like mud in the face of adversity. You both are so young, why must you hang on to the mud? Break up with him. I'm joking. I'm just trying to make you laugh. But joking aside, there is one thing the three of us can do together, form a band. Yes! Keep dancing. Don't let it stop. Dance until you don't regret this lifetime. Don't regret. What? You're worried? Dad. Is my terrible son calling me? Is he calling me? It's ok. What do you like about him? I wouldn't feel bad about throwing it away. I have no problem with throwing things out. How about you? I have a house full of dolls. I have never had a favourite. I would cuddle with whichever I wanted and cuddle whichever was comfortable. All right, I should go. That is mine. He loves movies. The look from his shining eyes moved me. His talents. His qualifications were surely better than mine. So, I could give up my dreams to fulfill his. No matter how much my parents objected, I had to follow him to Hong Kong. He opened his company and I taught dancing. We also had a common dream. What are you doing? The doctor said it's hard for me to be pregnant. So, for those few days every month, as soon as we're done, I would do handstands right away. Everytime we had sex was like a routine. But… Get back down. The blood will rush to your head. You even had alcohol. Are you okay? Forget it. We can't go back. Hey. Don't be sad.

Be careful of my lucky shirt. It's like a dead rat. Don't bring it back here. What will you use it for? So disgusting. Heaven, please don't let me moult again. It's enough to keep me like this. Because this stage is the funnest golden era of my life. Back then, in this lucky shirt, Seto, Bill and I were drinking champs, the Three Musketeers of Clubbing. I wonder if those two have died yet. Hey, excuse me. Are you collecting skins now? Is it collecting all four, you can get a free bowl of noodles? Do me a favour, go get me a horse-racing newspaper. Let me quietly hatch out a good quinella combination. That is the key in horse-racing. If not for that, I don't know if I could have settled the hospital bill and bailed you and your mama out on the day you were born. Bastard. You can't call me that. I'm your father. You're my father? You betted away all our money. When you lost, you would take it out on us at home. All day long you were stinky drunk. Mama hid in the room, crying and not daring to make a sound. If not for her assembling plastic flowers, and painting dolls for a living, I'd be dead. I was too young to know and Mama never told me, but you cheated on her. What are you saying? What do you know? I neglected my family? Who sent money to China every month for the whole village? Who scrimped and saved for nine years, to apply for your mother to come here? Without her, you wouldn't have existed. Those of us from other provinces didn't know anyone or anywhere. We had to socialize with the local gangsters to get on their good side. There would always be women next to you. - It's unavoidable. - I don't have a dad like you. Yes, at my age, I was not yet your father. You weren't even my sperm. You're not much better than me. You made those two women into a mess, you know? They didn't dump you, They are walking farther away while you are walking in place, it's you who abandoned yourself. You spermless weakling. Lai-wah told me everything. I hate you. I don't want to see this dad. Moult. Moult. Moult. Moult. What are you doing? Are you trying to fight? Are you done scratching my itch yet? Can't you fight me like a man? Always crying like a woman. Go away. Go away. Are you crazy? This home is still under my name. If anyone should leave, it should be you. Leave! Go! Why are you still crying here? I don't want a son who is not like a man. Also, Lai-wah left this bobby pin. Take it, give it back to her. Don't scorn the small stuff. You wouldn't have existed without the bobby pin. Go. Go! Guys. What are you drawing on my back? Make it look nice, don't scribble. You won't die without one kidney. My kidneys are not good. They're not worth any money. We can take your heart too. I'll die without my heart. We'll die. Take mine. People die without their hearts. All my organs are healthy, take mine. Such a good buddy. I'll cut you up first. I said, let them go. Who are you telling to let them go? I'm telling you, let them go. Obey, and you might live to go to a senior home. Let them go. I'm just passing through. I thought you were filming, so I stopped to look for a job as an extra. Excuse me, thank you. Fine, it's all right. If you say you're sorry, I'll let you go. Thank you so much. Excuse me for disturbing you. What is this "excuse me"? Can't you say "sorry"? Everyone, excuse me. How hard is it to say "sorry"? It's not. It's just an apology, just like "excuse me". Right? Excuse me. I want you to say "sorry". It hurts. Excuse me. Excuse me. You dare say "excuse me"? - Excuse me. - Sorry. Can't you say sorry? I will say sorry for him. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Don't hit him, sorry. Run. My childhood toy. What are you doing? Don't. I can't. No. You calm down. That swing was great, do it again. We hadn't started. Come back, let's try again. Watch the steep stairs. Come back here. We haven't started. I'm just passing through. I didn't see anything. I couldn't control myself. I didn't initiate. Excuse me. I came back to explain our senior services, hoping your father would consider them. I'm a bit surprised at how things turned out. It's no surprise. I can accept anything now. - Please continue. - No, listen to me. We were just discussing a plan, that is really inspiring. Discussing like that? - Fake marriages. - Fake marriages? Yeah, fake marriages. This I cannot accept. Everyone says Hong Kong is paved with gold. Just bend down and pick some up. I know what we're doing is not good. But I am working hard every day, and clients always take advantage of me when I'm selling, and I get yelled at by my boss when I go back. If I cannot be a pilot, I will not make my dream happen; I cannot become a soldier. All Hong Kong women now are hard to find men. Many have married mainland men. There are many opportunities in the mainland. Of course there are more opportunities in Hong Kong, but the Touch Base policy takes a long time. I want to get my identity card quickly, so I need a fake marriage. With a fake marriage, I can go to the Mainland, and not be cooped up in Hong Kong. Your thinking is wrong, Comrade. Hong Kong is the centre of East and West, and is a fishing village. It faces a vast ocean. It should be a bigger, better world, right? Why not staying in Hong Kong? The Chinese Yuan is worth more than the Hong Kong dollars now. Take me back to the Mainland. No, wait a moment. Have you clarified who is taking whom away? - He is. - She is. Why don't you both take me away? I don't even have a home now. What are you talking about? This is your home. This looks like someone else's home. Sign this, so she can meet her quota. Help her so she will help me, it's simple. I am willing to sign that. You're younger than I am now. I'll go stay there. No, you must understand, both of us are in the fake marriage, but you must sign the application form. After you sign, we can get our physicals. Right? Actually, that's not for this procedure. Why don't I go now? I'll come back in a few days. No, do it now. I'm in a hurry. I want to get my identity card. I beg you. Please, I want my physical now. May I? Please? Are you sure you know that's my dad? The incontinent one. You're crazy. It wasn't easy for your brother to come to Hong Kong. Such an innocent man is a very rare find in Hong Kong. I'm going to leave now. Why do I seem to be in a dream? But the decoration inside is very strange. Mainland people really are different. I will do anything to bring Ji-miu here to enjoy life in Hong Kong. I don't understand why that lady told me to take off my shirt for my physical. I think, to work in Hong Kong, I must put on extra shirts. Dad, your memory is really confused. Mama has passed away. Do you remember that? Those were hard days, you know? For three years. Your mother and I starved. We suffered so much. We decided I would go first, and send for her when things settled. Shockingly, it took me nine years to send for her. But when she came… After she came, I couldn't give you or her a comfortable life. If she hadn't married me then, she may have had a better life. If you two didn't marry, I wouldn't have existed. To live in this world, it's like cicada. I lie there and waiting, waiting for the sun to go up. I look around, and see that they are all nymphs. Stop. I'm scared of those. I'm itching all over already. I suddenly feel something moving under the back of my collar. It itches! I reach over to touch it. It is a cicada nymph. I look down at my pants. They are covered with those nymphs. I watch one of them, slowly, slowly moults its shell, just like you. Cicadas moult, so they can fly, while you, for my sake, to be reborn. Hey. Hey. I'm freezing. I need to get some clothes. It's like being awakened by Sergeant at dawn. So you're in your teens? I will proudly serve the China Air Force! I will become an excellent pilot. Pilot? So everything you've been saying is true? Yes. You know it well. You were a handsome heartbreaker then. Do you know when you were drunk, you would keep talking about flying airplanes? It was my dream to fly a Tianlu Type. The Tianlu fighter jet was the first Chinese high-performance jet engine fighter plane, it has the fastest climbing rate and speed. It can soar all the way to 16,000 meters in height in the shortest time. Would you like to try it? Sure. Can I bring my drink? I'll be flying very fast. So this is the Tianlu Type fighter plane? Sit tight! I fly very fast. I'm really flying in the sky. May I shoot a selfie with my cell phone? Yes. But you shouldn't be able to do anything. Get ready to land. So soon? Why did only one wheel come out? What do we do? Pull that wheel back in. We'll land on the chassis. Why can't I pull that switch? Can you please explain what the current situation is? Our current condition is very dangerous. We may die at any time, because we cannot land. How can you be so calm? Possibly because I'm a genius pilot. Don't laugh, think of a solution. Which switch can't you pull? I'll help you. - Hurry, where is it? - Don't touch. - Is it this one? - Not here, no. Not here. It came off! What do we do now? What can we do? There's nothing we can do. Look. The Taiwan Strait. You're playing a tour guide? Think of something, hurry. There's nothing more to think. We're out of fuel, all the lights are on. While the plane is in motion, we will glide down on the airstream. Sit back down. The plane is losing balance. What do we do? Explosion? No. Fortunately, we were out of fuel, but the impact force was great. When I woke up, I was in a bed. My left eye was injured. It compromised my vision, I could no longer fly airplanes. It's all right not to be a pilot. It was all because of this hairpin. It was left on the plane floor, I wanted to pick it up, and lost balance. I'm home. We all must have a meal as a family today. Mama. Why are you staring? Clean up the place. Ask Lai-wah to come over. Is it really hopeless between you two? Lost things are the most precious. She really is a good girl. We go shopping together. She has been taking good care of me. You are both alike, very tough and very strong. And very soft-hearted. Yes. In all those years, no matter how much I pissed her off, she never ran off and always stayed with me. So you knew. You really knew, right? - Yes. - You better. - What did you know? - Yes. I know that Ji-miu is a miracle, and fated. So dramatic. This hairpin made me lose 20% of my eyesight, and killed my dream of becoming a pilot. I wouldn't take it lying down. I heard the culprit was working at this factory. Can it be... the hairpin was Mama's? Of course not. Perhaps the hairpin was not intended to lead me to the culprit, but to meet Ji-miu. I was starving, so I went to a snack shop. Was this a meeting of destinies? It's a meeting of our fates. It was lunch time at the factory. I was very hungry, and went to my usual snack shop. Was this a meeting of destinies? It's a meeting of our fates. No way... We happened to be hungry, together at the same place, at the same time. He wooed me with that line. Our first date was at the movie theatre. I knew he was up to something. I didn't know they would show a scene like this. It's just a kiss. Even children today wouldn't find it special. Do you still remember the day I took the courage to hold your hand? Of course. You were so nervous that your palms were sweaty. It took me great courage to hold your hands. I had decided then I would never let go of you. Although I lost my chances in the military, I never stopped, because I found my next goal in life, to fight for a better life for Ji-miu. I told myself, we will be together for life. So everything you've said is true. Before Mama passed away, you never left her. All right, be a good boy, go buy me some scallions and garlic. Yes, Mama. Scallions and garlic. Does it hurt? Mama. Remember, you must get back up no matter how badly it hurts, and be a man. Be a courageous man. Be careful. The bamboo-kneaded noodles are ready. Who the heck stuffed my skin in the cabinet? My whole body stinks. It's because you are ugly, your skin will frighten people. Look who's talking. I'm not as scary as you, fooling around in front of the altar. You're the one who slept around. Nonsense. She took advantage of me. Didn't you see that? - If you were wronged, why didn't you call the cops? - What is the number? Don't fight. Come eat noodles. Eat noodles. Where are you going? Looking for a banana to eat. Sit back down now. I want to eat a banana, Mama. Behave, eat noodles first. Why will I become an old man with dementia? It's not me. It's him. Please start, Dad. Please start, Mama. Let's start. Don't stare, eat up. Yes, eat. I'll feed you. No need, I can eat myself. Then please do so. Can you pass me the scallions? Please? Get it yourself. You are me. I am me. You are you. But aren't you me, too? Ok, I'll get you the scallions. It's delicious. I want more. May I have another bowl? So what if I say you can't? You're already helping yourself. Save some for our son. He's a growing boy. He can't get enough food. Let him eat. Keep eating. I want to eat banana. No, you must eat noodles. Eat noodles. You can't only eat bananas. Mama is upset again. When I met Ji-miu, she never lost her temper. What happened? It's because this dude slept around. Ji-miu lost her temper then. Don't just dig up old stuff for the heck of it. I did sleep around, but I never had another woman. He didn't and he didn't. I look so good now. If I don't sleep around now, when will I? We relied on you as a last stopgap. How did you end up like this? You blame me because you messed up your life? It's your fault. I was counting on living in a mansion. Thanks to you I'm in a housing project. If not for you. You'd be in trouble. So I alone messed up your lives? Take your time. I was going to be a pillar of the nation. How did I become these useless guys? Bro. Do you remember what your goal was, in the beginning? To fly airplanes; be a pilot. And in the end? You wielded a pen in a commune. And you dare to criticize me? I dared to sacrifice myself for the country. I failed in the end, but am not ashamed. That's better than you, you, you and you. No ambitions. Nothing to do all day. Getting Alzheimer's in the end. You can't say that. Your logic is flawed. It's because he slept around, which caused him to fail in everything, which caused me to have nothing to do, which caused the Alzheimer's in the end. Get the cause and effect straight. You're brainless? Whatever. That's a lifetime. Why did you let him play with the pepper? Stop arguing. Speaking of which, whatever you say about me, I suffered the most in this lifetime. Think about it. It was so stormy that day that the boat capsized in thunder and lightning. Who was so determined to keep the faith, struggling to swim, hanging on to a watermelon, until arriving in Hong Kong? It was I. Yes, you're the best. Living the good life as soon as you landed. In the end, I worked hard to raise Lik-hang, the ungrateful kid. I had to take care of the family. You only earned money for the family. You didn't take care of them. You didn't consider why I had to take early retirement. I was thinking of taking care of Ji-miu. Having sons and grandsons with me. So smart, aren't you? Who will take care of me, Mama? Behave. The key person in my life is me. Think about it. I married Ji-miu. When we were dating, it was my happiest time. Really? Of course not. I was still needed to work hard to woo Ji-miu. Right? Shut up, young kid. If not for your inability to fly planes, by my age, I'd have 4 stars on my uniform. Old guy, don't even think about it. Have you thought about the previous me? Life would have been hard, you know? You shouldn't come to Hong Kong, right? No way, not coming to Hong Kong? I would never have any fun. It doesn't matter whether you came. In the end we had the Handover. Shut up. All you Mr. Tians. Stop bragging and blaming. Do me a favour, shut up and eat. Thank you. What's so funny? Mama. You're amazing. You stuck it out with all these Dads for all that time. It was not easy. You are incredible. It's all because of your Dad. He may be neither here nor there, but his life is full of difficult situations, and he fights so hard to get through each time. I know I never did well enough. Sorry. Good boy. Help me take out some noddle. go. I need to pee! I must pee. I have to go. I must pee. I gotta go. I have to pee. I have to pee now, now. Why do you need to pee at the same time? Of course we do. We're all the same guy. Must pee, it's great to pee. Somewhere over the rainbow By the clouds I once To chase our dreams Held your hand and flew Somewhere over the rainbow Skies are blue I look back at My thousands of dreams Blown away Look. I'll fly. I'll fly. I live to make a living And run out of time Finally, in the era I lose myself I take a road with no return Let's fly together. Finally, in time I weep with exhaustion I didn't say what I should have said And regret it. Finally. Wait for me. Wait for me. I'm coming. Drinking makes sadness sadder Hands that have let go Finally, in my dreams I run from myself That's what growing up is about That's what growing up is about I cannot cry out So I continue to find happiness Finally, in reality I let myself go I cannot laugh out loud Cannot hide the fakeness Finally, in my lies I despise myself That's what growing up is about Waiting for blossoms of the future Proud, youthful flowers Our lives are recorded in Short yet touching novels That's what growing up is about That's what growing up is about That's what growing up is about That's what growing up is about Too many mountains I cannot climb Every exhausting day I think of that dried-up flower Smiling as it greets each day That's what growing up is about Dad. Dad. It was like I had a deep sleep. Everything that happened this week was just like in my films. It was real, yet fantastical. I think this experience is what my dad wanted most to leave for me. final credits final credits final credits final credits Excuse me. I couldn't make it to your Dad's funeral. You understand right? I do. You're so determined this time. One must face facts, sooner or later. Please give this to your lawyer. I have something for you. Registration of Marriage Are you crazy? Yes. Because I've discovered there mustn't be so many "sorry" s in one's life, or in the end, one will be sorry for oneself. Also, I'm filming again. Frankie risked his life to get me a job. Tai lets me repay him while I work. With such a great chance, I must give it my all. Sorry. Type Tianlu Fighter Crashes to the ground. No, it lands. When a paper airplane falls, it may be crashing to the ground, but looking at it optimistically, it may be just landing. When it takes off again, it will be a fresh start. Well, Seung? Walkie Talkie. The cameras are ready. They're ready, all set. Remember to tell him not to track so fast. He's like rushing to his death every time. - Always in such a hurry. - Got it. - It must be done slowly, with feeling. - Okay. Sean, are you ready? Attach his mic now, quickly. These things always happen just before a shot. Hadn't you rehearsed already? We're rehearsed, okay. When you run, don't go too far left. Or you'll get in trouble, if you can't follow. Why are you so good at male artists' make up? Ready? Airplane? How long? Five more minutes. We'll finish this shot in fifteen minutes. - Okay? - No problem. We don't have to work overtime today. Careful. - Gaffer Yun. - Sir. Are you done? Ready as always. Okay. Has anyone seen Costumes? Call Costumes to Central Control. No problem. Do we need a rehearsal? Have you forgotten how to make films? No, sir. - Do I need to get up and help you? - No, sir. - Hurry it up. - Yes, sir. - Hurry, Mr Lik-hang. - All right. No rehearsal, let's shoot this. Ready. Shut up! Quiet. And roll. Rolling. Action. Ready? Teddy, he's quite good. He works hard and is energetic. You didn't have to tell him off like that. Nowadays, few people can take a telling-off, and still forge on. Next year I plan to make a few more films. Let him direct one of them. What's going on? Take all day? Ready. You want me to be blamed? Okay, it's ready. I know that director. It's Nicholas. Nicholas, I love watching your dad in the movies. That's not Nicholas. Nicholas. His name is Douglas. What? Douglas. Not bad. His movies are good as well. That's not his name at all. His name is Lucas. Not Lucas. Marvis, don't you know anything? Stupid kid. You don't need a DNA test to show you're my son. You work just as hard as I do. Be quiet. You're in a movie set. Your yakking disturbs Nicholas directing his film. Stop talking, or they will record all your voices into the movies. Come on, Nicholas. Are you done with makeup? Okay, done. Take all day for it. - Should I keep to the camera left? - Yes. - Okay. - Okay? Get ready. - Ready? - All set. Take it back to the start point then. Move, pull back. You want to be blamed? Hurry up.
