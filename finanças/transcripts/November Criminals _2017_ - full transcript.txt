ADDISON: My mother died six months ago today. At the hospital, they told us she'd had an aneurysm. There was nothing I could do for her. I guess I've gotten pretty good at pretending to be okay. (SIRENS BLARING) PHOEBE: I don't think this stupid thing is even working. ADDISON: You turn it on? PHOEEE: Of course I turned it on. ADDISON: Did you take the lens cap off? PHOEEE: Yeah, that probably would help. ADDISON: Okay, Phoebe, ean you just... PHOEBE: Okay. ADDISON: Ready? PHOEEE: Rolling, and action. Video Diary, day 18. Now, today is an extremely important day. Why? Because here is my applieation to the University of Chicago, where I'm hoping to study Classies in the fall. Have you ever heard of the Internet? I know nowadays you can submit this stuff online, but personally, I prefer the more traditional route. As you can see, this envelope is seriously thick. Why is that? Well, question seven on the application asks you to tell them what your best and worst qualities are, but they only give you three-and-a-half inehes. Addy, watch the road. Three-and-a-half inches on a page. I'm sorry, but my worst qualities took up a lot more than three-and-a-half inches. So I decided to throw in a few extra pages. How many? - Twenty-two to be exact. - Wow! - I realize that might seem a bit exeessive. - It does. However, how are you expected to express the very essenee of your being and your views on how insanely crazy this world is in such a tiny space on a page? - I mean, it's absurd. - Okay, Addy, shut up already. PHOEEE: There's a mailbox right there. ADDISON: Great. Phoebe? Can you please film this? - (CHUCKLES) - ADDISON: You're on me, right? Right. And now the moment we've all been waiting for. I know it's a moment you're very exeited about, Phoebe. You're very excited about this, aren't you? I'm excited to get some coffee. Just put it in the box already. Okay, give me the camera. Oh, Jesus, he's still not done. - Do it. - (SIGHS) - (HORN HONKING) - MAN: Hey! Move it! You know what? No. I'm not too worried about the extra pages because wasn't it Virgil who said, "Fortune sides with him who dares"? Or perhaps even more apropos are the immortal words of David Bowie, "I don't know where I'm going from here, "but I promise it won't be boring." PHOEBE:They're never going to read 22 extra pages, Addison. ADDISON: Well, for those of us who didn't get into Yale early, Phoebe, we have to put in a little extra effort. Two medium Americanos. What's your name? Add... Screw you, Brandon. Are you seriously with this guy? Do you seriously imagine I give a shit what you think? Yeah, but the whole school thinks you lost your mind, so... - Hey, Kevin, two medium Americanos. - Got it. - Are you going to pay for that? - Nope. Two medium Americanos for Addison coming right up. - What's going on, brother? - How you doing, man? - Good to see you, man. - Good to see you. - Did you read it, yet? - Oh! What? Dude, how are you so fast? I don't understand. What did you think? We'll talk about it after you've read the James Baldwin. Come on, man. I'm not as fast as you. Oh... Have you guys had your first kiss yet? ADDISON: No, I'm waiting. - Of course you would. - ADDISON: You should've seen this guy in philosophy class the other day, he nailed Miss Keneally to the wall. It was incredible. - Why? - Because she was giving a stupid lecture about why students cut class. And he said, "You're the reason why students cut class." - PHOEBE: Kevin. - No. I said, "People like Miss Keneally are the reason kids cut class." I was joking obviously. He wasn't joking. It was incredible. No, she is what's wrong with the education system. - Dude, I got to work. Okay? - ADDISON: Okay. Okay. Thank you. Good to see you, Phoebs. You got it. You stand up for the people, Kevin. You're a good man. - Here you go. Sure. - Thanks. KEVIN: Phoebe? - Huh? What's up? - How's he doing? He's okay. I'll see you later. (SIGHS) It's chilly. - Can I ask you something? - Mmm? I feel like you hanging out with me has, like, a detrimental effect on your standing with the cool kids. We've always hung out, Addison. Not really. I mean, we haven't really since eighth grade. I sort of went invisible there for a while. Okay. Well, maybe it's because I find every guy in high school to be completely dull and predictable. And why is that? Are they predictable because they want to hook up? Can we just get some music or something? Wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on. I feel like you see me as somehow sexually neutral from the Latin "neuter," as in, without testicles. (SCOFFS) No, I don't see you that way. I hate to break it to you, Phoebe. I don't want to disappoint you. But guess what? I want what all the other guys want, too. That's okay. Really? Actually, I've been thinking about this a lot lately. And I guess now is as good a time as any to tell you. I don't want to go off to college as a... As a what? Without having, you know, done it. Done what? (CHUCKLES) - Screw you, Addison. - (CHUCKLES) I wanna get it over with. All right? I want to have sex with a guy who I feel safe around. You know? Who won't judge me. And who is definitely a virgin, too. You're talking about me? Wait, what? What makes you think that I'm a virgin? Addison, shut up. So, my mom is in a meeting with the Secretary of Commerce until 6:00 p. m. - You want to do this right now? - Yeah. While there's a meeting between your mom and the Secretary of Commerce? Addison, I swear to God, if you ask me another question, - I'm gonna change my mind. - Okay, okay, okay. (ENGINE TURNING ON) (SIGHS) (TIRES SCREECHING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) - (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) - (GUNSHOT) Um... Do you think we should kiss? Uh... I think we should kiss. Okay. Here. (OPENING WRAPPER) (BOTH CHUCKLE) - Shit! Be careful. - Sorry. Okay. There. Okay. So... That's what this whole thing is about, right? There? That's all you're gonna say? There? I just gave myself to you. (CHUCKLES) There. Should I keep going? Sure. - Sure? - Yeah? Yeah? Okay. - Can I keep kissing you? - PHOEBE: Okay. Yeah, I wonder if you can. My son is making a film with my old video camera and he only has one tape left. And your website says that you sell new old ones, so to speak. Yeah, VHS-Cs. Sixty minutes. Yeah, I'll hold. REPORTER: We're here at the Seven Stars Bakery, and as you ean tell, it is a very active crime scene. And what we've learned is that at least one person has died. We'll continue to bring you information and details as it beeomes available. Now, there has been significant discussion about whether or not this could be gang related. PHOEBE: Hey. Hey. So, what do you think? That was okay, right? Yeah. I mean, that... That's gotta be some of the best sex I've ever had. (BOTH CHUCKLE) I can't believe we just did that. Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah. You know, I feel like... I feel like I just checked a really important box. I feel like I just checkmated it. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (PAGER RINGING) What's that noise? - I think it's my pager. - Oh... (PAGER RINGING) Okay. You should probably get that. I can't believe you still actually use that thing. My dad. Can I use your landline? - (CELL PHONE BUZZING) - Yeah, sure. My mom's calling me. Oh, God, she never calls from work. - Do you think she knows? - That's weird. I don't know. I swear to God, she has a sixth sense about this stuff. Hello? Yeah. Wait, wait. Mom, slow down. What? FIONA: There was a shooting at Seven Stars. A kid named Kevin Broadus was killed. Oh, my God. When? (WHISPERS) What happened? It's Kevin. FEMALE REPORTER 1: Kennedy High School student Kevin Broadus was gunned down today by an unidentified assailant. MALE REPORTER:...fled the seene of the crime on a red Honda motorcycle. FEMALE REPORTER 2: Only one person was targeted. No money was stolen. This has all the hallmarks of a gang killing. FEMALE REPORTER 1: We're gonna take you now live to the Metro Police press conference, where Deteetive Thompson is taking questions. THOMPSON: Still very early at this point. We're not ruling anything out. Thank you all. We'll be with you when we have more information. Thank you. (SIRENS BLARING) Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you know if Detective Thompson's here? No, I think he just left. (PANTING) - Do they have any idea who did it? - I doubt it. You know, these guys usually tend to close ranks. Who? Which guys? Whatever gang he's in. They'll just hide him until no one cares anymore. Why is everyone saying this is a gang thing? It's D. C. (SIREN BLARING) (DOOR CLOSES) Addison! Addison, why the hell didn't you call me back? - I paged you twice. - (GROANS) Something happened. (STUTTERS) I know what happened. It's all over the news. And I know you go to that place. What? Was he a friend of yours? Oh, no. I'm sorry. Son. I'm sorry. I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna go to bed. Okay. REPORTER: This is a eommunity and neighborhood that is coneerned about the killing of a 17-year-old. THOMPSON: Well, this community should know they can rest assured that the Metro D. C. Poliee Department is doing everything in our power to find the people who did this. - And we will find them. - FIONA: Phoebe? Honey? You almost ready? I thought I'd take you to school. No. I can... I can drive myself. It's fine. - Just, please. - Mom, can you leave it on? Please? No. It's really... It's not good for you to obsess about this. I'm not obsessing. Listen, I called Denise last night, and we both agreed that you should see her for just a couple of sessions, that it would be... Mom, you're overreacting. Just drop it. I'm not overreacting. I just think it's a very traumatic experience - and I think that you need to... - I'm not traumatized. Well, I am! I'm traumatized. Just call her! Okay? I've had experience in this, you know? I've learned the hard way that you really can't pretend that this never happened. You need to talk to somebody. And, clearly, you don't want it to be me. (DOOR CLOSES) (MUSIC PLAYING) (KNOCKING ON DOOR) THEO: Addy. Yeah. Hey. Morning. Hey, Dad. If you want to stay home today, it's okay. You know, I get it. No, it's fine. I'm going in. Well, then, why don't I drive you? No, I can drive myself. (SIGHS) Mmm... You... You all right? Not really, but... You want to talk about it? No. Thanks for this, by the way. Oh, yeah. I'm glad you could find a use for it. You know, when I pulled it out of the box, I found all this footage of you, you know, when you were little. The three of us. Uh-huh... Probably take a look at it sometime. All right, well, I don't want to be late, so... All right. All right, Dad. Take it easy. Love you. (MUSIC STOPS) (INDISTINCT CHATTER) KARLSTADT: Grief eounselors will be available throughout the day. For those of you who knew Kevin Broadus, please proceed to the first floor, where the police are taking statements. Go on in. FEMALE OFFICER: Did you notice anything out of the ordinary inside or outside the coffee shop before the shooting? ADDISON: Um, no. - Is there anything else you can tell us? - Yes. Kevin Broadus was not in a gang. How do you know that? Well, if you knew Kevin, you would know he wasn't in a gang. He wrote poetry, collected books, he was in the jazz band. Okay. Thank you. Um, did you get all that? We appreciate your time. Will you please send the next person in? (SIGHS) Uh, can I speak with Detective Thompson? He's not available right now, but if you remember anything, you should get in touch with us. I'll be going home See the light, see the sun I'm just going home (EXHALES) I don't suppose any of us got much sleep last night. Like most of you probably, I wept a little, I prayed a little. Kevin will be missed by the teachers for his diligenee. He will be missed by the jazz band, who is short one excellent trombone player. - Trumpet, but it's all brass. - A dear friend to many of you. Mostly, he'll be missed by his loving parents. I'm sorry. Sir! I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to be disrespectful or interrupt, but I just had to say something - that's really important. - Addison. I saw Kevin at the coffee shop yesterday right before it happened. Actually, Phoebe and I both did. And then after I heard the news, I went back to coffee shop, and one of the news crew guys told me that they're going to write this whole thing off as a gang killing. Which means they probably won't even go after the guy who did it because there's such a small chance of them actually solving the case. Addison, could you sit down please? I mean, if anyone here knew Kevin, they knew he wasn't in a gang. Addison, please, enough. I think this is something we should talk about. Why am I the only one saying anything? Addison, please. I've asked you politely. Sit down! Does no one care? I want to hear everything you have to say, in my office! All right. Okay. See me later. (ALL MUTTERING) Our emotions are raw. Everybody in this room is hurting. (WHISPERS) Really? Respect is important. So what's going on with you? What do you mean, sir? (GRUNTS SOFTLY) Look, there has been a marked deterioration of your behavior and your attitude lately. How are you doing? I'm fine. (SIGHS HEAVILY) Loss of a parent is a big deal, Addison. This has nothing to do with my mother, sir. All right. Here's what I suggest you do. Cut the theatrics. Let the police do their job. And you work your ass off. Make your mother proud. And I'll talk to Chicago. Tell them what an asset you are to the school. (SIRENS BLARING) (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) - Hey, no cameras in here. Turn it off. - ADDISON: Sure. I'm here to see Detective Thompson. OFFICER: I still see the red light. Turn it off now. ADDISON: Sorry. Sorry. You have an appointment? Not particularly, but I need to speak with him. He's very busy right now. Okay. I'm going to wait, all right? (DOOR SLAMS) (DOOR OPENS) Hi, Detective. So you're the kid with the camera. Yeah, that's right. We've got your statement. I understand that there's something that you'd like to add. Yeah. Um, you guys know that Kevin Broadus was not in a gang, right? We don't know that. How do you know that? Um, well, I mean, I went to... You know, I've been friends with him for a while, and I know that he wasn't in a gang. Who told you that he was in a gang? I thought you came here to tell us something. I mean, I am here... I just... I need to know what's going on. I don't have time for this. Could you deal with this kid? - Yeah, I got it. - Please sir, listen! My friend just got killed. And you can't expect me just to sit around and not do anything about it, okay? Listen, son. I know he was your friend, and believe me, we want to catch whoever did this just as much as you do, but right now, we're dealing with 24 homicides in this district alone, and that's just in the past two weeks. I'm sorry, but if you don't have anything new to tell us, I have to get back to work. Take it easy now. PHOEBE: Hey. I was looking for you. You okay? Yeah, I'm all right. Do you want to talk about it? Or... The police have already made up their minds. What? You don't know that. Listen, Phoebe, one second we were talking to him, and the next he's gone. It just doesn't make any sense. Everyone is just moving on like nothing happened. Addy. Someone needs to do something. Addy, I know after what happened with your mom... You know, sometimes bad things, I don't know, Addy, they just happen. Phoebe. That's really deep. I feel so much better. Thank you. Addison. I'm just trying to help you. (SCOFFS) (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Nowhere to run The whole world won't find you Six degrees of Separation from you I'm not moving Till the sun shines on me Said I've been longing Longing for apricity I'm not moving 'Til the sun shines on me I've been longing MS. ARANGO: Addison? Hi. Can I help you? Yeah. Uh... (STUTTERS) Mr. Venderleun needs toner. Again? (CHUCKLES) - (SIGHS) You wait here. - Okay. You tell Mr. Venderleun from me that these resources are for the entire school and not just for his class. Okay, I will. Thank you so much. Call out your name I said I'd find you Hey! Hey, there's something... There's something I gotta show you. I have Mandarin in, like, five minutes. - Mandarin? No. This is really important. - Yes. Look, I can't. I skipped it last time so I could sleep with you. - So I have to do it today. - Come on! ADDISON: Look. This is from Mrs. Strauss. "Kevin has begun to show signs of emotional trouble. "The recent slide in academic results suggest "he may be dealing with significant emotional difficulties "outside of school, "which he is reluctant to elaborate upon in our sessions." Christ, Addison. What do you think that means? I don't know. I think I should talk to Strauss. And say what? "Hi, I stole your file, "and, you know, I would love if you could talk me through it"? No, obviously not, but I think this could lead to something. What if we could figure this out? (SIGHS) Don't you even care? That's not what this is about. Phoebe. Come on. We... Like... I saw your posters today outside of the gym. - I tore them down. - What? Why? 'Cause, Addison, everyone's making fun of you. - They know it's you. - So you're embarrassed by me? No, I'm not embarrassed by you. It's okay to have sex with me, but you don't want people to know we're friends? Of course not! I mean, of course it's okay that we're friends. Listen, if you're ashamed of me, just tell me, okay? No, you idiot! I did it because of in spite of how stupid you're being, I actually give a shit about you. (PAGER BEEPING) Um, can I borrow your phone? This could be a lead. (SCOFFS) Jesus Christ. Come on! Let me borrow your phone. (SIGHS) (TELEPHONE RINGING) - Hello? - ADDISON: Hello. Addison? (PHONE HANGS UP) Addis... - Who was it? - I don't know. They hung up. Addison, you don't seem to realize that I'm going through this, too. And I can't stop thinking about it either, okay? But... (SIGHS) It's not about you. And there's nothing you can do to change it, okay? Now I'm late for class. I gotta go. (TELEPHONE RINGING) (TELEPHONE CONTINUES RINGING) (RECORDER BEEPS) ADDISON'S MOTHER: Hi, you've reaehed the Sehaeht family, Sarah, Theo and Addison. We can't come to the phone right now. So leave us a message, and we'll get back to you as soon as we ean. (RECORDER BEEPS) KARLSTADT: Uh, hello. This is Principal Karlstadt at Robert Kennedy High. I would like, if you ean, for you to eome in tomorrow at 8:30 into my office. It's a matter of some urgency. FIONA: Parents and children should be in touch with each other. THEO: We are in touch with each other. FIONA: Through a pager. Except, he had to use my daughter's phone to call... All kids borrow each other's phone all the time, don't they? - He doesn't have a cell phone? - No. Is that a problem? Why didn't you get him a cell phone? Okay, let's all calm down. Let's stay very calm. It's not a problem. It's a matter of... - It's a safety issue. - Could we calm down please? I'm just trying to make sense of this. So, his son has put himself smack dab in the middle of a murder case. - Am I right? - Well... Listen, my son is a good kid. Can I just say that? I mean, he's been through a lot this last year. Yes. He's lost his mother and now he's lost a friend. What I'm trying to say is that I think he's just trying to help. Right. I am not gonna let his kid jeopardize my daughter's life, nor her future for that matter. Okay. I'm gonna stop us right here. This is a very, very precarious time for all of us. So I'd like you to keep that in mind when you discuss this with your children. Yes. Of course. Thank... Thank you for the meeting, Mr. Karlstadt. It's been very educational. Thank you. Okay, I'll speak to you again after you talk to your children. Thank you very much. I'll talk with him tonight. (CLEARS THROAT) - Hi, beautiful. - Hi. You doing okay? (SIGHS) Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Um, so, what's up with your asshole boyfriend? It's just that I heard some weird stuff, that's all. Do you want to talk about it? No. Not really. Oh... Okay. - BO: Hi. - Hey. Uh, could I have a word with you? Yeah, what's up? Can I talk to you in private? Yeah. Sure. Um... Hey, Alex, will you just watch my stuff? I'll be right back. Yeah, sure. PHOEEE: Thanks. I kind of wanted your advice. Yeah? Something to do with Kevin. Yeah. Um... I was in the coffee shop when it happened. - Really? - Yeah. I saw something, and I don't know if I should tell Addison. Tell him what? Addison. Mrs. Strauss. Do you have a minute? Sure. Come in. The guy who killed Kevin was white. I saw his wrist when he pushed the door open. I know something was going on with Kevin before he died. And I heard that you and him were talking because he was going through some emotional difficulties. So, what do you think it means? I don't know, but I told the cops, but I don't think they're looking in the right place. Why? I mean, I heard Kevin was hanging out with that kid Noel. - Noel? - Yeah. And I know he's mixed up with some heavy people. They're dangerous. What we talked about was confidential. Just like the conversation we're having right now is confidential. Yeah, of course. But I just want to know if there's anything, you know, if you had any idea of what was going on with him. Addison, if you want to talk about how you feel about what's happened, we can do that. No, I'm all right. Thank you. Look, just promise me you won't tell any of this to Addison. Just not right now, okay? Yeah. Okay. - Thanks, Bo. - Yeah. I'll see you. Yeah. (SIGHS) THEO: I was at your school today. And I was catching a lot of shit about you. About this. What's up with this, hmm? What's going on? Addison? Remember that day that Kevin was killed? Yeah. I drove back to the coffee shop after it happened. That's why I didn't call you. Okay. And I... I saw his body. Yeah, I saw Kevin. Like, I saw them wheel him out. Here's this kid. He gets murdered, and no one cares. That's not true, Addy. You know that's not true. No, it is! That's what it seems like. People care. They do. They just... Will you just do me a favor? Just stop this nonsense. This is... This is crazy, Addison. It's not nonsense. I'm just trying to do something good. Yeah, I... I understand, I think I do, what you're trying to do. But this is a murder investigation. You don't know what could happen. Nothing's gonna happen! Well, I couldn't take it if anything did happen to you. Just... If you can't do it for me, do it for her. All right? Yeah. ADDISON: Video Diary. Day 23. I don't know, maybe my dad's right. Maybe I'm not thinking straight. Maybe I shouldn't forget about the rest of my life. ADDISON: Phoebe! Hey. What's up? Hi. (SIGHS) What? Look. So, I know the other night was purely a practical thing for you. And, you know, I have nothing to compare it to, except for maybe porn and stuff. But I just have to say that it really was sensational, in the original meaning of the word. And I have a strong and overwhelming desire to do it again. (SIGHS HEAVILY) That's bad, huh? Well, you know, when I woke up this morning, I... I looked over at the pillow where your head had been. Uh... And I... And I kind of wished it was still there. (CHUCKLES) I don't know, we're probably - just romanticizing it. - Romanticizing it. Yeah. That's classic. (CHUCKLES) But, uh... Maybe if we did it again... What? It might break the spell? - That works. - (LAUGHS) - Should we... - Yeah. Okay. PHOEBE: Are you sure your dad's not home? ADDISON: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure. He's out shooting bridges for a Belgian tourist brochure. Long way from the Washington Post, huh? What? (CHUCKLING) That... That was pretty good. Right? I mean, what do you think? Better, same? Worse? Not worse, but... Okay. I mean, the spell is definitely broken. Yeah. Really? (GRUNTS SOFTLY) No, Addy. I want you to hold me. (LAUGHS) (CHUCKLES) (GRUNTS) Is it just a one-time thing? I mean, like... I mean, if we do do this again, which I hope we will, I mean, like, do you want to usually do the holding afterwards or beforehand? Usually afterwards, I'm guessing. That's good. I'm just curious, you know. - I want to be... - Shut up. Okay. Okay. Um... So, what? I guess we just keep... We keep doing this until the feeling wears off? Yeah. Yeah, I'll call you. Okay. How are you getting home? I'm gonna grab a cab. Don't worry about it. It's fine, okay? FIONA: Hi. PHOEBE: Hey. I brought dinner. Um, I already ate actually, but thank you. Okay. How was your trip? Good. How was class? Fine. I learned five more ways to say "hello." (CHUCKLES) It was eventful. Should we talk about Addison Schacht? Wow! - You really have people everywhere, huh? - Really? Addison Schacht. Okay. What? What's the problem? We moved up the hill and they moved down. I went in to your school yesterday, and I had a meeting with Karlstadt. He told me about Addison's so-called "investigation" into the Broadus murder and your involvement in it. (SCOFFS) I'm not involved in it. He's a friend of mine. That's it. So he's just a friend, huh? What does it matter? What do you have against him? It's not his fault that his life has been so shitty. His mom died. I'm not talking about his mother dying. I'm talking about you pulling this shit with your friend. And I just don't want you to get involved in something that will most definitely hurt you. Only memories remain Only memories remain For a time There by the sea There was only you and me In a land that time forgot You uttered sweet forget-me-nots And you know yeah, I never will But sometimes life has otherideas And though we both know... WOMAN ON PA: Addison Sehacht, please report to the Principal's office. Addison Schaeht to the Prineipal's office. (SCHOOL BELL RINGING) That's it, Addison. Last chance. What happened? They're suspending me for a week. What? Because they looked in my locker for posters and they found Kevin's file. Okay. Well, what are you going to do about it? (SIGHS) Now I've got nothing to lose. Addison, they didn't expel you, okay? Just go home and... And chill out. They might not put it on your record. FEMALE REPORTER: A suspect was arrested on Thursday in connection to a separate robbery. MALE REPORTER: Sunday morning at 4:30, violence was unleashed downtown on a taxi driver. FEMALE REPORTER: In other news tonight, police are still looking forleads in the case of slain Kennedy High School student Kevin Broadus, whose killer fled the scene on a red Honda motoreyele. (TV CLICKS OFF) (SIGHS) (DOORBELL RINGS) - Hi. - Hi. Um, is Addison home? No. Well, he should be, but no, he's not. Phoebe? - Yeah. - Oh! - Hi. - Hi. Well, why don't you come in? Yeah, yeah. Come on in. Yeah, okay. Um... Don't mind me. It's chili night, and things tend to get out of control. Oh, it's fine. Don't worry about it. So, how are you doing? Um... I'm okay. You know, considering everything. Yeah, I'm sure. Do you want to sit down? Yeah. - Sure. I don't mind standing, though, it's... - Here. No... Some of this stuff out of the way here. Don't mind the mess. It's okay. How's your mom? - You've known her for a while, right? - Mmm-hmm. Yeah, since... Well, since she first came to Washington. That's almost 20 years now. Was she always so... I don't know, like that? (CHUCKLES) Your mom's a perfectionist. But she's had to work real hard to get where she's at, and you seem to be turning out pretty good. How do you think Addy's doing? I don't know actually. You know, I hope he's okay. (INDISTINCT TALKING) Addy? - Hey, Dad. - Hey. I saved some chili. Uh, I'm not really hungry. I'm just gonna go to my room. Hi, Addy. (CHUCKLES) What are you doing here? Oh, we're just having some ice cream. Want some? Just waiting on you. Addison, come on! - Hey! - (DOOR CLOSES) (KNOCK ON DOOR) PHOEEE: Addison? (DOOR OPENS) Can I come in? (DOOR CLOSES) You have a nice little chat about me with my dad? Come on, Addison. Look, I'm just worried about you. Well, if you came here to try to talk me out of doing anything crazy, - don't bother. - That's not why I'm here. I just came back from the police station. And it was a complete waste of time. I'm kidding myself. No one's gonna solve this case, and there's sure as shit nothing I can do about it. All right. I heard something. And I don't know if it's true or not, but I've thought about it and I can't not tell you. - What? - You can't overreact, all right? Because I don't even know if it means anything yet. I'm just giving you the information. Yeah, what is it? The guy was white. The guy who killed Kevin. Bo saw him. He said he was white. What do you think, it was a race thing? I don't know. Honestly, I don't think so. Bo said that Kevin was hanging around with some pretty dangerous people. Who? Do you remember that kid Noel? Fat Noel from eighth grade? Yeah. That's who Kevin was hanging around with. Phoebe, just because Noel listened to gangster rap when we were younger doesn't make him dangerous. All right, Addison. Well, look, that's what Bo told me. He said Kevin was mixed up with some pretty heavy people. So there. I told you. Wait, hold on. Hold on, hold on, hold on. Um, do you have Noel's number? Why would I have Noel's number? I don't... I don't know. Do you think, um... Do you think Noel still has a Facebook? Okay, so it's Tuesday night, around 11:15. We're on our way to see our old friend Noel. Earlier tonight, Phoebe told me that he might know something about what happened to Kevin. So, he invited us to this address, 267 Otis Street. Um, this is... This is Otis Street here. Wait, who are these guys? Maybe this is it. PHOEBE:I don't think this is it. ADDISON: Oh, no, no, no. We're good. We're good. PHOEBE: Addison, this is super sketchy. If they see that we're, you know, stressed out, they're gonna think it's weird. Just, you know, stay calm. (OVERLAPPING CHATTER) - Shit! Shit! Shit! - PHOEBE:Go! Go! PHOEBE: Oh, my God! Why the hell are we down here? ADDISON: Just give me the address. What's the address again? - Addison, why are you turning... - ADDISON: No, that's it. That should be it. PHOEBE:There? That's an alleyway. ADDISON: Relax, okay? It's gonna be fine. PHOEBE: I'm not gonna relax. ADDISON: It's gonna be fine. We know him. - We don't know Noel. - ADDISON: Yes, we do! We went to school with him for so long! - You saw Noel five years ago. - Five, so what? - Five years ago. - Do you see where we are right now? Fine. You can wait in the car then. PHOEBE: No way. I'm not doing that. ADDISON: Is this really where Noel's friend lives? What's his name again? PHOEBE: He said to ask for some guy named D. Cash. (HIP HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Yo, you got visitors. Come on in. Take your hands out your pockets, man. You're making me nervous. - So, you're Addison. - Yeah. - I'm D. - Hey, man. Good to meet you. What's your name, baby? Who is this? You brought me a little gift right here? I'm Phoebe. - Phoebe. - Yeah. - You want to have some fun? - PHOEBE: I'm okay. She's with me, man. Mmm? - I'm okay. - What'd you say? She's... She's with me. Man, I will slap your nose off your face, man. Shut up, Addison. Yeah, you heard her. You better shut up, dude. All right. Hey, your friend's here. Noel, wake up, man. Hey, get your ass up, Noel. They're here. Wake up. (GROANS) Is that Noel? Who's this bitch? Hey man, it's Addison. Addison, yeah. Good to see you, man. (SCOFFS) You look like shit. D. CASH: Well, sit down, man. (SMACKS LIPS) ADDISON: Uh, so, how you been, man? You high already man. I'll take this. Put that shit down. It's crazy, right? It's been, like, five years, six years. Why are you so interested all of a sudden? Well, um, the reason why I'm here is because I wanted to ask you about something. - Okay. Uh... - Uh... The shooting in Northwest at Seven Stars. I don't know if you know or not, but this kid Kevin Broadus, who we know, he was the one who got killed. Yeah, what are you asking me for? Well, I... I heard, you know, you guys were hanging out. So, what do you think happened? I mean, we just heard that the guy who did it was white... D. CASH: Enough of this shit, man. Enough. Noel, you got this kid's number? No. I have a pager. (SCOFFS) You got a pager. Where you live, son? Uh, we're actually from Philadelphia. We're just visiting. I know where he lives. You're still at the same place, right, Addy? Yeah. Same place. Good. I think you kids better get going, man. Get out of here. No problem. If we hear something, who knows? Maybe we'll give you a call. All right, white boy? Okay. Thank you. I'll send him my number. Get your ass home, man. PHOEBE: Why the hell would you tell them where you live? Noel still thinks we live in Chevy Chase. We used to be rich, remember? Well, that's just great. Phoebe. I'm really sorry. - I don't want to hear it from you. - Okay? I... I am. - I don't want to hear it! - Okay. I need a break. I can't keep doing this. I can't be a part of this anymore. (SLOW INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING) (PAGER CLATTERING) (LINE RINGING) Yeah, hello. Who is this? Oh, yeah. Yes. This is he. Yeah, no. Thank you, sir, for calling. Yes. Okay. Okay. I'll see you then. FIONA: Phoebe! Hi. I'm in here. Listen, I'm hanging up, all right? Call me if you start to panic. Bye. - Good morning. - Hey. Can we talk for a minute? We can talk later. I gotta go. It'll only take a minute. Okay. Well, Addison Schacht's father called me last night. Yeah? It was kind of illuminating. I have to admit. I didn't... I hated the fact that he knows more about what my own daughter is doing than I do. Did you like it over there? I mean, yeah. I don't know, Mom. It was... It was fine. Theo's a nice guy. Yeah, he's a nice person. It's true. - Okay, well... - I just want to say that I'm... I'm... What? What I want to say is I apologize. I'm very sorry for not listening to you. Sincerely, my intention was to help. (SIGHS) I'm gonna head out. I love you, Mom. I gotta go. I love you, too. ADDISON: Okay. Here we are. Uh, 775 McKinley. Kevin's house. Uh... (SIGHS) (DOORBELL RINGS) Hi, Mr. Broadus. You must be Addison. Come inside. Would you like something to drink? I'm okay. Thank you. So, you're a friend of Kevin's? Yeah, I'd definitely say we were friends. Enough of a friend to go to all this trouble? Sorry to be blunt, but the fact is we'd like to know why you're taking such an interest. Do you think the police aren't doing their job? - But... - Then why are you so interested? Well, I... I guess it just doesn't really make any sense why anyone would want to kill Kevin. (PAGER RINGING) Sorry. I'm so sorry. It's my dad. I'll turn it off. Walter? Come with me. Come with me. Walter. My son valued his privacy. He kept us out of here for the last year. We had to break the locks. Then when my wife could finally face coming in here... She had to find this. Open it. Open it! What is this? You want a reason? - There's your reason. - What is that? - Look at me! - I don't know what that is! - Why do you have a pager? - What? - Are you a dealer? - No. Were you supplying my son? - No. Absolutely not! - Tell me! Walter, stop! Please. Stop! Please! (SIGHS) What do you want from us, Addison? You want to know why my son was killed? I don't know why. But maybe we're just going to have to learn to live with that. (WHIMPERS AND SIGHS) I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to make it worse. It's a god-awful small affair To the girl with the mousy hair But her mummy is yelling "No" And her daddy has told her to go But her friend is nowhere to be seen Now she walks through her sunken dream To the seat with the elearest view And she's hooked to the silver sereen But the film is a saddening bore For she's lived it ten times or more She could spit in the eyes of fools As they ask her to focus on Sailors fighting in the dance hall Oh, man! Look at those eavemen go It's the freakiest show Take a look at the lawman Beating up the wrong guy Oh, man! Wonder if he'll ever know He's in the best-selling show Is there life on Mars? (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) PHOEBE: Ni hao. DELEGATE: Ni hao. (BOTH SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) FIONA: Uh, Phoebe's been... Has early acceptance into Yale next year. Um, excuse me. (SPEAKING IN MANDARIN) - Hi. - Hey. - Hi. What's going on? - I need to talk to you. - Addy, this is a really bad time. - I need to talk to you. Shit. Okay, just come on. Addy, what? What's up? (SIGHS) I just came back from Kevin's house. You know he was into drugs? Like, serious drugs? - Wait, what? - Yeah. I don't know. Maybe that's what Strauss meant by "emotional difficulties." FIONA: Phoebe. Uh, hey. I'm sorry, Mom. Just one second. - Addy, I gotta go. I... - Wait. I just... Phoebe! Please. Addy, what is it? You know, I never told you what happened that day with my mom. No. She was fine. Nothing was wrong with her. That morning, we were having breakfast, and then I went to school, and when I came back she was... It's okay. She was still sitting in the same seat where I left her. At the hospital, they told us that she'd had an aneurysm. (SIGHS) Then, last week, we see Kevin at the coffee shop. - He gave us our coffee. - Addison. He gave me back my book. It's not the same thing. Yes. It is. It is the same thing. He was fine, too. Don't you understand, Phoebe? I couldn't do anything about her. Addison. I don't know. Maybe I'm trying to solve something that can't be solved. Addison. (DOOR CLOSES) (MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYING) (PAGER BEEPING) NOEL: Addison. Uh... D. CASH: Man, give me the damn phone. Yo, it's D. We got something you might want to know, man. Meet us in an hour. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Hey. No alcohol for minors. D. CASH: No, we're good. Kid's with me. (CHUCKLES) (SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) So, where's the girl at? You said you got something for me? We got something for you. It's right here. Just little errands, man. No big deal. Look, you do this for us, you get a name. That simple. Are you kidding me? I'm not... I'm not gonna do that. Do I look like I'm kidding, hmm? Hmm? Okay, well, you don't want to know nothing, man. I'm out of here. Go back. Hold on. (TISKING) Thatta boy. Yeah. Now we talking. You're saying if I do this for you, you're going to tell me who killed Kevin Broadus? No. But I will tell you the guy who knows the guy who did it. Okay. And... Where do I have to take it? Back to your neighborhood. We can't go down there, man. Not in Chevy. Police would be on our ass so tough. Sniff us out. But a kid like you? (SIGHS) Golden. Yeah, and crispy. (CHUCKLES) No. I'm gonna need a little more info. I told you. I told you. Addy's a quick learner, man. He's a quick learner. He ain't even got hair on his nuts. Look at him. NOEL: Give him... Give him a taste. D. CASH: Give him a taste. Okay. Let me tell you. There's a guy, you know. He comes down, hangs out sometimes. Smack dealer from Maryland. He's out of his mind. He's... You know, he comes into D. C. and he parties at the clubs. - That's what he likes to do. - Yeah. And according to our friend, Kevin was down there to buy some shit. So dealer was sitting in his big chair, you know. He's sitting in the room with all his homies at a table. You know, he see Kevin. He decides to pick on him a little bit. Nothing too serious. The next thing you know, Kevin went right back at the guy, and shit, man. Like he was going back and forth. It made the guy look bad. Bad. Real bad. This kid disrespected the wrong guy. D. CASH: Disrespected him, man. I don't even know what Kevin said, but he said something because he got a big laugh. I mean, he... He signed his own death warrant. Shit. When... When was this? A couple of days before he got shot. You're saying that all he did was say the wrong thing to the wrong guy? D. CASH: Wrong damn thing, man. (SIREN BLARING) (SIGHS HEAVILY) Oh, my God. (DOORBELL RINGS) (DOORBELL RINGS) Addison? Alex? - Uh... - What the hell are you doing here? Is this 27... I think I have the... Shit. Really? ALEX'S DAD: Alex, who is it? Uh, okay. Okay. Um... Just act normal like I left my sports bag at school and you're dropping it off as a favor. This for you? (SIGHS) Just give it to me for God's sake. All right. Thank you. Bye! (CHUCKLES) No, you're funny. Get the hell out of here. Go. All right. See you later! ADDISON: Hey, D. I did it. What's the name? D. CASH: What name? What are you talking about, man? ADDISON: Come on, D. What's the name? We had a deal. D. CASH: Don't rush me, man. Now, the guy we told you about, his name is Mike. Mike Lorriner. He was there when Kevin got into it with that dealer. ADDISON: (STUTTERS) And what's the address? (LINE RINGING) - PHOEBE: Hey. - Phoebe! Phoebe. Mike Lorriner. Write this down, okay? Mike Lorriner. 9756 Fork Lute Road. This is the guy who knows who did it. D. just told me. Okay. So you already ealled the poliee, right? No, no, no. It's fine. I'm just gonna go talk to him. Addison, don't be stupid. Do not go there. Just give the poliee the address and let them go. - Phoebe, I got it covered. - Addison! (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS IN THE DISTANCE) Hey. Uh, hi. Are you Mike Lorriner? - (SIGHS) Who are you? - Um... I'm sorry. I don't mean to bother you, but... I heard that you knew something about what happened in D. C. a few days ago. You know, the kid who got shot at the coffee shop. D. C.? I don't know anything, man. It's about Kevin Broadus. Uh, he was a friend of mine. I don't know what you're talking about, man. Get out of here. I heard that he pissed off a drug dealer or something, and you... Do you know the guy? I don't know, I just... I just... What did I just say to you? Did you hear me? I... I said, I... I... I don't know nothing. - All right? Now... Now just get... - All right. Get off my property. Okay. Sorry, man. I'll go. I'm leaving. Hey, wait, wait, wait. Wait. Who... Who gave you my name? Who... Who told you to come here? I'm sorry. It's just a mistake, okay? Of course it was a mistake. Who told you? Uh... This guy I know, D. Cash. He just... He said that you were there when... D. Cash? D. Cash gave you my name? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Uh... (CHUCKLES) Okay. Well, you... You... You tell D. Cash that he probably shouldn't be running his mouth. - You got it? - Okay. I'm gonna just go now. Okay? Whoa, what... What is that? What is that light? MIKE: Are you... are you filming this? (MIKE LAUGHS) My man. Are we making a movie? Well, I... I guess I'm ready for my close-up. Look, man. If you don't know anything, it's fine. I can just leave. Do you think I will not use this? Bang! (CHUCKLES) That was pretty good, huh? You don't even know who that dealer was, do you? The one your boy Kevin pissed off. That was D., you idiot. Oh, he played you. (CHUCKLES) See, now I'm in a spot. (STUTTERS) Uh, you know, I... I... I did that ungrateful asshole a favor. And this is the thanks I get? Well, fuck the both of you. - (GRUNTS) - (GUNSHOT) (PANTING) Why is that? Well, question seven on the application asks you to tell them what your best and worst qualities are, but they only give you three-and-a-half inehes. Three-and-a-half inches on a page. I'm sorry, but my worst qualities took up a lot more than three-and-a-half inches. So I decided to write a few extra pages. PHOEEE: How many? ADDISON: Twenty-two to be exact. PHOEBE: Wow! ADDISON: I realize that might seem a bit excessive. PHOEBE: It does. ADDISON: However, how are you expected to express the very essence of your being and your views on how insanely crazy this world is in such a tiny space on a page? (EXHALES) He's fine. - He's very drowsy, but he's stable. - Okay. Yeah, he's going to be all right. (CHUCKLES) Well... Hi. Sorry. He's asking for Phoebe. (CHUCKLES) Okay. Hmm. FIONA: You want some coffee or something? Coffee? No. (CHUCKLES) NURSE: Phoebe's here. Thank you. Hi. Hi. You smell nice. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Did they find Lorriner? Yeah. They caught him. Somewhere in Virginia. He still had the gun on him, Addy. They think it's the same gun he used to kill Kevin. And they got D. Cash and Noel, too. The Broaduses know. They know who killed their son. You talked to them? Yeah, they came by. (SNIFFLES) They left that letter for you. I'm still so mad at you. I know. I should thank you. Why? Because if it weren't for you, I'd probably be dead. Really? Because I totally thought you had it covered. (BOTH CHUCKLE) (CAWING) (WAVES CRASHING) ADDISON: Video Diary, day... I don't even know what day it is anymore. (CHUCKLES) But guess what? Someone must have read those extra 22 pages because I got into Chieago. You know, these past few months I've come to realize that I don't have to pretend to be okay anymore. Because for the first time in a long time, I am really excited about the future. CHOIR: Amazing grace, how sweet... ADDISON: But at the same time, it's never easy to say goodbye. That saved a wreteh like me I once was lost But now... ADDISON: Well, I'm... I'm glad we could stay for that. Yeah. I can't believe we're leaving for college already. How do you feel? Well, you know, I just... I feel weird, I guess. What are your plans for the holidays? You think you'll be back? I don't know. - I'll... I'll walk you to the door. - Okay. - So... I guess... - Listen. I... I got you something. Maybe you can use it. (MUSIC PLAYING) Love me, love me love me, say you do Let me fly away with you For my love is like the wind And wild is the wind Wild is the wind Like the leaf clings to the tree Oh, my darling eling to me For we're like ereatures in the wind And wild is the wind Wild is the wind Wild is the wind Wild is the wind Wild Is the wind (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)
