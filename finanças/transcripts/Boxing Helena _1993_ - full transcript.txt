You were watching me, weren't you? Hi, Lawrence. Hi, Nick. I ordered for you. Thanks. So to the end of another fine one. I hear you made history in surgery today. I had some very good help. Well, people are talking, and Pollin is ecstatic. Just glad the little boy will be all right. Nick? We've got to get out of here. Lawrence, let's go. She's here. I'll see you outside. Check, please. There you go. Hello, Anne. I'm going to keep mother's house, move into it. Chicken sounds fine. I'll have to stop by my apartment first and pick up a few things. Well, if you get there before me, there's a spare key under the mat. Me, too. Here you go. Thank you. Do you think she ever thinks about me? Does it really matter? No. Thanks for the drink, Lawrence.

Hello, Helena. It's Nick. How are you? Hello. Goddamn it. Hello? Christ. Baby, what are you doing? Come on. We're not finished yet. I hate being hung up on. Just so fucking rude. I hope you're not planning on lying there all night? Not alone, no. Now, come back to daddy. Never. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Gee, Ray, what could I possibly mean by that? I believe I meant get out of my bed. You bore me. I bore you? No, I don't. Look, I'm in a bad mood. You need to lighten up. And you need to pay closer attention. I'll keep that in mind. Good. Check, please. What are you doing? I'm going out. Oh, get me some groceries. I'm not your goddamned errand boy. I'm going to the club. Why? Gee, Helena. Why would I possibly be going to the club? I'm going to get laid. I'm out of here. Sam. Hey, it's Helena. Fine, thanks. How you doing? Listen, I need a delivery, ok? Bottle of Sterling vodka, bottle of Rose's lime juice, and two large pomegranates. Ok, three medium. Yes, please. Ok. Thanks. Good night, Helena. I've told you-- the money doesn't matter. It's most important that I'm fully moved in today. Yes, I understand. 312 Gatcombe Lane. Mm-hmm. All right. I'll expect them. Thank you. 7:00 onwards? Oh, great. Bring her, too. 312 Gatcombe Lane. And take a left on homestead road. You can't miss it. Yeah. It'll be lots of fun. And don't forget the video. See you then. No, no, no, no. Solamente. Ha ha ha! Si. Hasta pronto. You shouldn't leave your door unlocked. It isn't safe. You never know who may stop by. No kidding. Do you want something? No, thanks. I'm in a kind of a hurry. Listen. You know, it's a big night at the club. I want to see you there. I'm busy. Right. Here. Yeah. Wear this. Ha ha! Ray. I'm going to a party. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. So what's the suitcase for? Going to Mexico. What was that? I said I'm going to Mexico. I leave in the morning. Ah, Mexico. A little party, then we're off to Mexico. What is this shit? I don't like it. Ray, I'm sorry. I'm not fucking around. I want to see you. You're going to have to change your plans. I don't have to do anything, Ray. I'm not one of your employees. "You're going to have to change your plans." Who-- Know what? This whole scene's getting old. You're getting kind of old. Good-bye, Ray. You're going to miss me when I'm gone. Doubtful. Oh, yeah, you'll miss me. Fuck you. Watch who you say that to, Helena. Hasta whatever. Enjoy yourselves. Hi, Nick. Hi, Jean. Drinks are through there. Thank you. I'm very impressed. This was a good idea. Everything is fine. People seem to be having fun. Sure they are. It's a great party. Nick. I didn't know you were such a party animal. This is... This is great. Nice to see you, Dr. Augustine. Russell. Is that a full bar down there? Yes. I'll catch up to you guys later. What are you drinking? Vodka tonic. You want one? Just a sip of yours. Thanks. Good evening, ma'am. There he is. Hi, Nick. Helena. Yes. You're here. Nice place. The barman will mix your favorite drink. I bet he's going to pop the question on you soon. You think so? Who else could all this be for? I'm so glad you could come at such short notice. So you live here? Yes. This is my new home. I was brought up in this house. My mother passed away last week, but it's ok. I'm fine about it. Lawrence. Nick, what's this? Look, if you're going to follow me around, hold this. Thank you. Who is that? What's her name? Helena. Look at you. Give me that. Who is she? She's Helena. Mmm. What do you think maybe we-- Russell, I'm wet. I'm going to go change. Then we'll go somewhere and really eat. Ok. Did you come here alone? Yes. Well, who do you know here? Hmm. A little boy named Nick invited me. Oh. Well, that's-- that's great. That's wonderful. Maybe you and me could go get some champagne together. Ok. Nick, what in the hell made you do that? Do what? Invite her. So you invited her here. Are you sleeping with her? I'd better go. I'll see you later, Nick. Isn't this a wonderful party? So? So? Nick, are you sleeping with her? Come in. Hey, Nick. Helena and I are taking off. I wanted to say thanks. She's leaving? Yeah. She's not your girlfriend or anything, is she? She came on so strong. She's someone special. Of course not. Don't be silly. Go on... Have fun. Thanks, Nick. I'm leaving. Oh, come on, Helena. It's Anne, Nick. Damn. Oh, Nick. I meant to tell you. Thanks for the flowers. It was a wonderful party, Nick. Ha ha ha! Hello. This is Dr. Cavanaugh. Please leave your name, number, and any message after the tone. Thank you. Hello, Nicholas. Are you there listening? Look, I left my purse, and I need it. I'm going away. Don't be a curious George, Nicholas. I want you to bring it to the airport tomorrow at 10:15 a.m., terminal B, second level. Oh, and, Nick... Russell says hi. This is the last call for flight number 126 to Guadalajara, Mexico. Flight number 126 is now boarding at gate number 31. Give me my purse! I know I'm late. I'm sorry. Just give it to me. I'll get you on another flight. It's my fault. Do you realize I sat at that fucking gate waiting over an hour for you. I asked you to do me a simple favor. Where's my address book? Come on, Helena, I tried to be here, really. Let's change your ticket. Where is it? I didn't see any book. I don't believe you. I didn't see any book. Go get it. I swear I wouldn't recognize it. You'd have to come with me. You make me sick. You're coming? I'm coming to get my address book. That's all. Then you're driving me back here. Fine. Fine. Here we are at the house, Helena. I'm so glad I got to tell you that story in such depth and detail. I'm really sorry, Helena. Well, we'll find your book. Let me fix you lunch. Then you can go to the airport, home, whatever. You don't get it, do you? What is it gonna take, Nick, for you to realize I don't want anything to do with you? Wasn't last night enough? Please. Just have lunch with me. I'm not hungry, Nick. Well, just a drink then? Please. Oh, shut up. Let's just get it over with. If you go into the living room, I'll look for your book. Nick. Just let me look, and--and you'll relax. Hurry up. Your mother didn't die inside the house, did she? No. She was at the hospital when she passed on. Now that it's mine, you can come here as much as you like. My home is your home. Nick, this isn't a game. Where's my book? I'm not playing a game. Here's your drink. Had my drink. Have some food. What is wrong with you? I told you I am not hungry. I want to... You son of a bitch. You had this the whole time? Don't be upset. I'm leaving. Wait! Helena! Wait! Helena! What? I'm sorry. No! Please don't take this the wrong way, Anne, but I thought you might know whether he plans to return to work. It's been several weeks, and I'm without my chief surgeon. I'm sorry. I haven't seen Nick-- Dr. Cavanaugh-- since his party. I see. Well, if he doesn't return, I can only assume we've lost him to another hospital. That's a tremendous loss, but perhaps he could submit a letter recommending another staff surgeon as his replacement. If you hear from him, please have him call me. Very good, Dr. Pollin. Dr. Binford to the coronary care unit. Alan... What a beautiful day. How nice to see you. Iced coffee? Yeah, uh... Yes, sure. So, what can I do for you besides quench your thirst? Ahem. Well, I, uh... I thought you could recommend me for your job at the hospital. You are leaving? Alan Harrison... Chief surgeon? Look, I... I simply thought you could write Pollin a letter. You... I'm more than qualified. But I have until Monday to return. Am I right? Yes... As far as I know. Well, then, we'll know Monday. Sure, fine. Ahem. So have you-- uh, have you been enjoying this time alone? It's very pleasant, yes. I, uh... I remember-- What the hell is that? Stay here, Alan. ...Onto the roadway. The highway patrol has all northbound traffic... Helena. Oh, did you want to hear music? ...Develops into anything more serious. Boy, it's a real mess out there. Again, that's all northbound traffic at a standstill. Remember, no matter how much traffic there is, you've still got time for nutritious, great tasting maple sticks-- crunchy, flaky sticks-- What the hell's going on here? She was hit by a car outside. The driver never stopped. When I got to her, she was hypoxic and cyanotic. Her blood pressure was life-threatening. I had to operate here in the lab. Nick, this is unheard-of. Why isn't she in the hospital? I took care of it, Alan. Now I'm taking care of her. I was going-- listen to me. I'm calling the hospital and have her brought in. I know that you meant well by caring for her-- don't send anyone here. She needs to be looked at. Listen to me, Alan. I want to take care of her. I can do it. No one else will understand. A woman like Helena wouldn't survive in a hospital with all those constant reminders of her loss. She's happy here. She doesn't want to be with other patients. I care for her. It's not that simple. She needs 24-hour care. What about your life? I love her, Alan. She's happy here. I was about to resign so I could be here for her. Take my job, Alan. I told you it's not that simple. It is exactly that simple. I'll call them Monday and tell them I'm not coming back. No. I... I don't know. I... You'll, uh... You'll write that letter, huh? The job will be yours. I promise. She'll be safe... And you're the ideal choice for my replacement. I'll send the letter right away. Good-bye. If anybody... I was never here. Good-bye, Alan. It's warm. It's sore. Helena, you're looking much better. It's a dream. Really quite beautiful. Everything's ok. Helena, it's Nick. Everything's ok. Listen to me, Helena. It's a dream. There was an accident. Can you hear me? It's ok. Everything's ok. Look at me, Helena. Look at me. It's a dream. It's a dream. Helena, it's ok. You'll remember. Oh, my legs are burning. They're burning. Th-they're burning. They're burning. They're burning. Good morning. I want you to get that thing out of here. But it's for you... So you can get around. I'll help you get into it. Your help is what put me here in the first place. No. Yes! I wouldn't be here if you hadn't been late to the fucking airport! If you hadn't been so incompetent and so fucking stupid! Helena! At least you're alive. Shit! Hey, Nick! Nick. Nick! You're pathetic. I just want to take care of you. You're everything to me. You're nothing to me. I'll never let you care for me. No one ever has, and no one ever will. Leave me alone. Let me explain. It was just-- leave me alone! Do you want to scream? Right! Let me hear you scream. You want to scream, Helena? Come on then. Scream! Scream for help! Let go of this chair! No! Go on, scream! Scream! Scream to those people in that window. Let me hear you! I can't hear you! Come here, Nick. Scream! Please, Nick... Please. Come to me. Shh. Shh. Help! Help! Help! Help! You know what, Nick? I never had an orgasm with you. Not one. You shook the entire time. Remember, I had to tell you what to do? Hands everywhere. Sloppy. Shaky, shaky, shaky. I was afraid. You still should be. I only wanted to make you feel good. You haven't the faintest idea how to make me feel good. I know you now, Nick... How you think, what makes you panic. I know your little secrets. I can hear you crying and moaning. I can hear you jerking off. You're sick. Oh... I'm sick. I don't want to talk about anything like that. No? Not in that way. Maybe that's why you don't fuck that way. You're horrible. You're a failure. Good evening, Mr. O'Malley. How you doing, Sam? Listen. I need a favor. I'm looking for Helena. If you see her, if she calls, if anybody calls, you call me. It's important. Here's my card... And here's your incentive. Anytime. And I've made you a delicious pudding. Nick? Hello! It's Anne. Hello! Sorry. I have to do this. Hello! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Hmm! Hmm! Hello! Come on, darling. Shh! Shh! Nick? I'll let myself in, ok? Please! Anne... I'm sorry. I was working. Is everything ok? I was worried about you, about us. I missed you, Nick. I tried calling, and I couldn't get you on the phone. Ohh... Everything's fine. I didn't know what to think. Ohh... So what have you been doing with yourself? Dr. Pollin asked me about you. I didn't know what to say. Anne... Oh... Hmm! Hmm! Hmm! Anne! Just relax, Nick. Oh! Anne! Come on, Nick. Relax. You like this. Anne. There you go. See? Oh. Fuck me, Nick. Ahh... Oh! Oh... It's ok, honey. It's ok. It happens. Ohh... I don't mind, Nick. We were rushing it. We can try again in a little while, Nick. No. Hey, I'd like to. It's ok, Nick. Let me get you a drink. So let's just sit together and talk for a while. I don't want to talk. Ok. We don't have to talk. We can just be together. I want to be alone. Did you do that? Well, yeah. I thought it came unplugged. Did it occur to you that it might be unplugged for a reason? That maybe I don't want to be bothered. I'm sorry, Nick. I didn't know. Anne, I think you'd better go. Now. If that's the way you feel, Nick, here's your key. I'm sorry, Anne. I'm sorry, too, Nick. Madeck's flowers. May I help you? Yes. This is Nick Cavanaugh. Well, hello, Dr. Cavanaugh. What can I do for you this evening? Send something extravagant to the usual address. Something big. And the card should read, "I miss you, Helena." You must have spent most of your life feeling ashamed. You're pathetic. What did it take you, a whole three seconds? Oh, and apparently, "that's ok, sweetheart, because it happens..." Again and again and again. I can't say I don't know how she feels. You must have lasted, what, a whole two seconds with me? You're a goddamn joke. You don't understand. I love you! If you were a real woman, you'd lie to me about our sex. Real women lie all the time. Real men lie all the time. Real people do a lot of things, and you bet they lie. But when they lie about sex-- bedroom lies-- it is out of love and respect for certain feelings, and I don't give a shit about your feelings! Uh! Oh! Why lie? "I miss you, Helena. "Where have you been? Please call me. Love, Nick." I'm sorry. I forgot your medication. I'll be right back. Nicholas. Nicholas... You have done a very, very bad thing. Helena, these will make you feel better. I'm sorry. I know it's hard, but you do look beautiful today, and the flowers are fresh. Go ahead. Good. It doesn't matter. It doesn't change anything. Looking good, Nicholas. Thanks, Barney. See you later. Right. Don't you ever leave me alone here again. I'm sorry. I thought you were sleeping. Someone will find out, you know. Ray will kill you. He'll kill you. But do you really want that? You need me. I'll never need you. You need me now. None of those other men ever cared for you, but I always loved you. And I'll take care of you, no matter what. You don't love me. You think you can't be a man without me. But I have you. Make a wish. They never come true. Mine has. Helena. Helena. Yes. I'd like to reorder a prescription. Dr. Cavanaugh. Midtown general. Yes, the same-- 75 milligram capsules. A-u-g-h. Nick! Yes. Nick! Just a minute. Yes. Send them over. If I'm not home, please leave them in the mailbox. Add it to my account. Nick! What? Nothing. You're not going to answer your own phone? I don't want to answer it. You're hiding? I would if I wanted to. No, you wouldn't. Watch me. Hello. Lawrence. Hi. Um, well... In the middle of something. Helena's here, Lawrence. Well, we're very happy. You sick bastard. She's such a kidder. I don't know if that's such a good idea. She may remember you from the party. Do you remember Lawrence from the party? I'll put her on. He wants to know how you are, Helena. Tell him the truth. I'm a fucking prisoner here! You should see what he's done to me! Hello. Are you there? I hate you. I don't hate you. I'm getting to know you better all the time. I wish you were dead. But I'm all you have, and you want to destroy me. Everything we have! If I lose, you lose, too. Why don't you tell me about the accident again, Nick? The terrible, terrible accident. What, did I have a few scratches? A sprained ankle? Look at what you've done to me! How can I ever look at myself and think of myself as worthwhile? Worth something! You did this to me! I never meant for it to be like this. I love you! You're a liar! I love you! Liar! I swear I love you! For you! No! No! No! No! Helena. No! Helena, look at me. I can do it. I can make you happy. Kill myself! Kill you. Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me alone. You really are that frightened, aren't you? Of everything-- of women, of me, of yourself. Aren't you? No. You are. A woman is something soft, something warm when you feel her... When she is naked... When she is touched... Discovered. You see the things happen inside of her. She opens up... Sometimes a woman is sad. Sometimes she is angry, helpless, beautiful. Sometimes she is strong. She's still only that one woman. Talk to her... In deep whispers. Tell her what you're doing, what you see. Move slowly. Tell her you're inside of her. Tell her how it feels. Touch her. Use your tongue. Your breath. When she's about to come, she'll grab for you, but don't let her come. Make her wait. Tease her. Play with her. Make her feel. She may touch herself. She's so sensitive now. You can't be afraid. Take her. Take her. Look at you. Your bath's running. So? So what? How did I do? What do you think? I thought I was pretty good. Mm-hmm. Talk to me. It was good. Wasn't it? I wasn't paying much attention. Fine. I only did it for you. Here... Have a taste. Nick, I need to ask you something. What? Helena. Do you love me? My god, of course. I never stopped loving you. No, no, no. How do you love me? I'm not sure I understand the question. Do you love me as a woman or as a possession? Tell me. I love you as a woman. I love who you are inside. Nick... I don't want to be alone. I don't want you to be alone. I want to feel like a woman again. Please, give me back some of what you've taken away. Kiss me. Kiss me. Helena. I'll be back in a moment. Chalet Bordeaux. How can I help you? Dr. Cavanaugh, hello. Sure. That'll be no problem. Vodka... Lime juice. Mm-hmm. Pomegranates. Sure, doctor. It's on its way. Mm-hmm. Touch... Me. Remember me? Your goddamned errand boy! Get out of my house! I don't think so. My god. Helena... What happened? What the hell happened to her? You! You did this! You made her a freak! Get out of my house! Leave him alone! Don't hurt him, Ray! Don't you hurt him! You want me to stop? Yes, I want you to stop! Stop! Stop it! No, Helena. No! You don't know what you're saying. You're messed up. You need help. Look at you. I'm fine. You don't belong here! Get out of here! Don't you fucking move! Sorry, Helena. Ray, Ray, put the gun down. This is none of your business! He should die. Put the gun away. We don't need you here! Go away! Damn you! She was beautiful! She is beautiful! Please! Don't hurt him! Get out of here! You don't want my help? No! Fuck you. Nick, I need you! I love you! Wake up! Nick, wake up! My god, Alan. Back with us, Nick? Where's... Helena? Listen, the operation's over. She's recovering in room 308. She was on the table for 6 hours, my friend. Anyway... Whenever you're ready, go on in. She should be waking up soon. I got to run. It's 308, ok? Oh, Anne. I just came to see that you were all right. Nurse Anne Garrett... I'm... Nurse Anne Garrett to radiology. You come and find me later. Dr. Cavanaugh. You did this to me! You made her a freak! Aah! That's it. You're going to be ok. I'm with you. Get her in. Get her an I.V. Stat. She's lost a lot of blood. Let's get moving. It's going to be fine. Just hang on. I'm coming with you. Let's get moving! You were watching me, weren't you? No! I'll never need you. I... Hate... You. Leave me alone! I am still haunted by my love for her.
