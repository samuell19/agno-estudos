\ Amazing. - Once upon a time-- - Do I know this one? - No. - Okay. Okay. Now, there was a fair princess... whose father, the king, went off to fight in a foreign war. When does the young knight come? - He just did. - Yes, he did. And it better hold him for the next ten days. We can always sneak off to a motel, can't we? You've promised. Keep talking. The king had placed his daughter in atower room... where there were no windows and no doors. She was left there for long. Slow. Slower. Time. Many years passed and she began to forget... what the king looked like. And all she could do was dream. Michael, when you meet him... give it time before you jump to any conclusions, all right? He's your father, I'm in his debt already. I mean, without him I wouldn't have just had the best train ride of my life. Attention, please. Arriving Grand Rapids, Track 6. Express Metro Line... Michael, this is my Aunt Vera. - How do you do? - You are welcome to us. -It's always good to be welcome, thanks. - You're welcome. Come this way. So, how is he? Florian works too hard. The business, the politics, all too much. - You don't expect him to change, Vera. - I know. And now he is involved in the Congressional election. He's quite a powerful guy, huh? You'll see for yourself, Michael. You go in, I'll park the car. - Michael. -ls this the one? Yes, Father, this is Michael. Irina's Michael. I'm lrina's Florian. Irina hasn't told me a thing about you, sir. I was born at a very early age to poor but honest parents. Me, too, sir. You must call me Florian. Only, not right away. I enjoy to be called "sir" for a little while longer. - She's myjoy, this one. - Mine, too. To be the joy of two men, what more could a girl ask for? I think I have one ofthe answers to that. Oh, it's an Aubusson. Late 16th, early 17th. From La vie d'AIexandre series. - She's good, no? - Better than me. Made for the royal family. You like it? It's gorgeous. Needs a little work, but it's all double. It's yours. Your wedding present. Tata, it's much too valuable. It's a paltry thing compared to you. Where did you find it? Where did it come from? Romania. Good things are coming out ofthere now. \ - Where should I take these? - Upstairs. -L'll get some food for you. - No, we're fine. -It's no problem. - Who's this? Don't you recognize your namesake, the Archangel Michael? - The slayer of evil. - Ah, that St. Michael. "Towards the unclean heart I mercilessly point my sword." I'll be good, I promise. Come on. Better be good. But you tell me I'm always good. That's what you tell me. Yeah, then make sure you'll be staying in my room alone. I told Bishop Dancu... that you were going to talk to him about a very important matter. I'm assuming you have no objections... to being married by an Orthodox bishop. Bishop? I've kind of strayed from the flock for the past 20 years or so. For the privilege of performing lrina's wedding... he'll overlook almost anything. How did you meet our Irina, Michael? I followed her. - Excuse me? - He did. - I saw her in the street. - I was going to the museum. So I followed her, but she disappeared through this door marked "staff only." He'd wait outside till the museum would close. And it was cold. Every day after work there he'd be, shivering. He'd ask me if I'd have dinner with him. Actually, it was an egg cream and a cannoli. You asked her before even you're introduced? - Yeah. - And what did you say? I said no, I thought he was strange. But I kept coming back. I'm interested, Michael... how did you protect your pride, each time she said no? Yeah, that was a problem. See, where I come from, a guy doesn't do that kind ofthing. A girl doesn't want you, forget her. But something about her... I don't know, she just kind of hypnotized me. What can I tell you? - I like him. - Me, too. I think they should have been introduced. - Hi. - Hi. Just wanted to come in and check on you. How come you're still up? - I was talking with Florian. - What about? About everything. We were speaking in Romanian. How do you say, "l wanna be inside you"? It's kind of hard to translate. Not one ofthose common Romanian phrases that your parents used at breakfast? My mother never spoke Romanian. She may have tried to learn. I can't remember. I was only five when she died. What you said at the station about Florian not knowing we are lovers. I know we're not going to sleep together. I mean, not here in this house. You're not gonna pretend we don't get it on, are you? Florian comes from another country, another age, another culture. Things like that are not taken for granted by him. Not by me, either. You know I want to show my respect. Being a part ofthis family means a lot to me. A lot. But I don't think I wanna lie about anything. You won't have to lie about anything. Just don't be too eager to tell the truth. You're running away, Michael. Yeah, but only in a circle. I'll be back. We must talk, you and I. Yeah, I've been working on my speech asking you for lrina's hand. The hand we can come to terms over. The whole woman, I'm not so sure. What a sight, to see you coming through that door. And to see you sitting here, pondering the problems ofthe world. And to see you sitting here, pondering the problems ofthe world. So, is it good to be all grown up... and live far away from home... and visit your father only on his birthday? Sometimes it's very good. Sometimes it scares me. Imiss you. - Hi. - Hi. - Great diner. - Yeah, you should try working here. - Do you know how to make an egg cream? - A what? An egg cream. It's a drink. It's got seltzer, chocolate and vanilla syrup, a little milk. - Yeah? -l'll just have a coffee. - Okay. - Thanks. Hi, how's it going? - You've run a long while to get here? - About four miles. - You have no car? - No, I like to run. You can run, but nowhere can you hide, right? Yeah, I guess. Thank you. - Can I get you something? - Just water. - You are not from here? - No, just visiting. L, too, am not from here. I'm just now from Romania. You guys got things pretty shook up over there. - You see any of the shooting that went on? - I saw enough. Now I am here. Are you visiting, or are you gonna stay? To visit Romanians here. - My girlfriend's father is Romanian. - What is his name? Stroia, Florian Stroia. Do you know him? - From Bucharest, I know him. - Yeah? I know him from Bucharest. Here we do not know each other. - Good day to you. - Yeah, right. What's your name? So I could tell Florian that we met. Kayatsa, he will remember me from Kayatsa. Kayatsa. I'll take your coat, Christina. - You look very well, Irina. - Thank you. She is too thin and too pale. So, where is he? Can't wait to see what you went all the way to New York for. - He went for a run. - Running? He's a fitness freak? He teaches physical education. That's his job. - How do you teach that exactly? - Hey, good morning. - Good morning. You have a good night? - Yes. - Hi, I'm Michael Rossi. - Glenn Popescu. - How do you do? - This is my wife, Catherine. Pleased to meet you. Good morning, sir. This is our daughter, Christina. Hi, Christina. You're a very groky number. Irina, why don't you show Michael your photo album? Tata, do you really want to get into all that? I think he should see your past. - Are you married? - No. What is "groky"? It's a word from a sci-fi classic, Stranger in a Strange Land. It means total communication. - I hear you are a sportsman. - Sort of. Maybe you'd like to come hunting with us. Hunting? Maybe I should take a shower first. I'll only be a minute. This is really pretty. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I won't be too long. Come on. I moved around a lot as a kid. My father died before I was born and my mom raised me. When I was eight, she was killed in a car crash. - Do you remember her? - Oh, yeah. She was funny. I remember her smile. She was terrific. This was his mother's. - What a beautiful ring. - Yeah. Who's this? That was my mother. - That's the only photograph we have of her. - What happened to the others? There are no others. Is that you? That was the Romanian festival, part of our summer camp. It is you. I don't believe it. This looks like a Nazi salute. No, that cornball thing is 100% Romanian legionnaire. The legionnaires were patriots. Most ofthem got wiped out by the Germans. Florian was lucky. The festival honors the memory and the spirits of our heroes. It's real creepy. They call out the names of the dead and everybody yells "present." These traditions keep the movement alive for us. Things like that are important. \ And now, let me welcome... a man we all know and respect and love... a dear friend and a true patriot, Florian Stroia. I want to thank Bishop Dancu. These are indeed wonderful times for those of us... who have kept the faith... that Romania would again one day be free. And now, my friends and fellow countrymen, from me, no speech. I am much too interested to learn who will win our raffle. Now, the winner of this magnificent 21-inch color TV... is number 93. Bishop Dancu, this is my daughter's choice of a husband, Michael Rossi. -It's a privilege to meet you, sir. - Michael Rossi. Irina, you look beautiful. I always forget how lovely you are. Thank you, Bishop. We leave you now, to find out what you can about my future son-in-law. This is your first visit with lrina's family? Yes, it is. - Be seated. - Thank you. Michael, ifl may call you Michael? Fine by me, Bishop. Florian is a great man... but to be his son-in-law will be sometimes an arduous task. That's nicely put, sir. I've known him for more years than I care to remember. He will test you. That's the kind of man he is. And you're marrying his Irina. A very interesting young man. But I fear he would keep you from us. That depends on if you frighten him. He's not so easily frightened, I think. Well, you haven't tried, have you? Not yet. And I'm very grateful. I love him very much, Father. And I love you very much. I sense you are a man who's sure of himself. May I suggest, it is not always necessary to win... in order not to lose. Bishop, the only thing worth winning, I've already got. Anything else, I can go along with. Welcome in among us, Michael. Now go and dance. Don't let him dominate her all night. Thank you, Bishop. Excuse me, mind if I take a turn with your lady? - You want a drink? - Yes, please. Two red wines, please. I was watching you and the Snow Queen dancing. Talk about groky. Total communication seemed to be occurring. - What did you call Irina? - The Snow Queen. - Why? - That's what all the guys used to call her. Nearly drove Glenn crazy for two years. Wouldn't put out, got nothing. - Thank you very much. - Guess she's melted some, Michael? - That would be telling. - Yes, wouldn't it? Watch this. This is the guard on parade. I've seen so many live through that nightmare, while I was safe here. - You would be dead if you had stayed. - Perhaps. But here, all those faces from our homeland, it is wonderful. I met a guy today who just got out of Romania. But he wasn't there tonight. - Where did you meet him? - In the diner. He said he knew Florian from the old days in Bucharest. What was this man's name? What was it? Kayatsa. No, he said you'd know him from Kayatsa. That's right. - What did he look like? - He didn't look good. Kind of sick. Maybe that's why he wasn't there tonight. - Why did he talk to you? - I don't know. And what did you tell him? Tell him? He was a guy in a diner. I told him what you tell guys like that. I said, "l'm visiting my girlfriend's family." What's everybody so uptight about? \ You see, Michael, Florian has people who do not wish him well. There are still many bitter ones... left over from the Communist regime. There's a whole network of spies. Spies? This guy looked pretty harmless. You didn't tell him anything? - What would I tell him? - Are you sure? - About what? - You didn't tell him anything personal? No, honey, I didn't say a word about our sex life. How could you say that, Michael? How could you? In front of Florian? - I made a mistake, all right? I'm sorry. -lt was totally uncalled for. Look, Irina, I spoke out ofturn, but you get so jumpy around him. What's so bad, anyway, that he knows we like to do it? Are you trying to hurt me? No, honey... I made a mistake. Baby, I'm sorry. Look, I'll apologize to your father. I'll apologize to your aunt. That's fair... but I don't need to apologize to you... because it's not my fault your folks don't know how much we like to... What the hell are you doing? Stop, you sick... Did you call the police? Don't you think you should? I called my friends. This is the best way. Look, I know I'm an outsider... but I do intend to be a member ofthis family. Would someone like to tell me what's going on? Yes, Michael, perhaps it is your right. Irina, I will speak with Michael. It's not fair. You've been through this enough. We have been through it... and if it is God's will, we will come through it again. Come, Michael. Since you asked to be member ofthis family... I must burden you with some of our troubles. Make yourself comfortable, Michael. You're sweating a great deal. Can I get you a drink? - No, thank you, sir. - Please sit down. You probably know... very little of Romanian history. To be honest with you, I'm not even sure exactly where it's at. I saw the stuff on TV, but that doesn't tell you much. Romania... was an ally ofthe Nazis during World War ll. That is, we were occupied by the Germans. If you ask me what I did during the war, I can tell you quite simply I was a guest... ofthe Nazis at one oftheir... luxury resorts, it was called... Buchenwald. I came to this country, Michael. I was a refugee from political persecution... first the Nazis, and then the Communists. America was a haven to me. Years later, I met lrina's mother. We were married, we were happy, Irina was born. It was like... the dream of every immigrant. And then, it began. People whom I did not know accused me... of collaboration and worse. Irina was just a child. So it's still going on. That stuff on the wall, that's the same thing, right? But the war was over 45 years ago. Who's still doing this? Crazy people. Like this guy, this Kayatsa guy. Kayatsa was a labor camp. I was there for a time. When I was taken away, perhaps... someone there thought it was because I had helped the Nazis. Men cannot be blamed for wanting to blame. Mr. Stroia... I'd like to apologize for what I said in the hall. It was rude of me. I'm sorry. And I would be sorrier if I thought you were going to call me Mr. Stroia. From here on, my name is Florian, you will use it please. Okay. Thank you. Michael, this is Stellian. He will be guarding us for a while. I'm glad you told me. I'd hate to run into you without a formal introduction. And I think maybe it will be good for us... that this has occurred while you are here. It will make you part of our family in a very special way. - That's what I want. - Good. - Very impressive, your old man. - I know. \ He's a very strong man. Must have been a tough time for you when they accused him before. It was a nightmare. I couldn't go out to play... and my mother wanted to take me away but Florian said no. I can see your mother's point of view, I mean... -you were just a kid. - No, you don't understand. Everybody was after him. People were picketing the house. People were put up to it by the Communists and Jewish people who didn't know... that Florian was also in a concentration camp. He stood right up to them. All ofthem. He wouldn't hide, and he wouldn't let us hide. He was magnificent, my father. So what do you get for a magnificent father? You don't have to get him anything. My gift can be from both of us. No. Maybe I'll give him a book, that's always safe. Book section is that way. I have to do some shopping for Vera. I'll meet you there? There you go. Hi. I'm looking for something on antiques... or those hanging rugs. - Tapestries? - Yeah. - Try the corner or center island. - Thanks. Find anything? No, I got sidetracked. Did you get what you were looking for? - Yes. We have one more special stop. - All right. Excuse me, we'd appreciate it if you'd leave the books with the covers facing out. I'm sorry. List us for service for eight... and we'll take the soup tureen... and the gravy boat. The name is Rossi. R-O-S-S-I. Can I see your price list? Be right back. - You pulled that shit this morning. - Did you ask Stroia about Kayatsa? It was you, right? - I am someone who survived Kayatsa. - Yeah? So is he. - So is Florian Stroia. - Oh, yes, he survived. All those with guns survived Kayatsa. - All finished. -l'm not. Something caught my eye. It's not for you, honey. We can go back tomorrow. All the stores are closing. You go on, I've got time. I'll get a cab. - We're closed. - I know what I want. We're closed, sir. Look, I have exact change. What's the state tax? I'm sorry, sir, ljust locked the register. Come on, man, it'll only take a second. Come back tomorrow. I'll be happy to put the book aside for you if you want. Jerk. - Sir, did you just come from the bookstore? - Yes. - Come with me, please. - All right. I left the money, right? I mean, tell him. - I wasn't going to steal the book. - The book was $30.89 with tax. - So for 89 cents I'm a thief? - Relax. We'll have all this taken care of. We'll have a little chat with the security chief. It's a well-known fact around these parts that Norm keeps a tight tail. Sit down. Relax. - You work here? - Oh, yeah. This man tried to remove a book without paying. - Paying properly. - I made a mistake. I was in a hurry. But I wasn't trying to steal the book. I left the money. Well, most ofthe money. I was trying to learn something about Romania. I mean, I am marrying into the place, right? I'm sure we can work something out, Norm, and to everybody's satisfaction. I owe you 89 cents. If you don't mind, let's not mention this to Florian or Irina. Don't worry. I'll be the one that holds it over you. Thanks again. \ Nice break. Now we see how you play. - It's really not my game. - I won't beat you too badly. - You two aren't betting against each other? - Not yet. I spoke to the Bishop Dancu. He can see us tomorrow about setting a date. I'd like to talk with the bishop by myself. I wanted to explain to him-- Why you haven't made a confession in over 20 years? Yeah, something like that. The Bishop understands our little falls from grace pretty well. - Nice shot. - Thank you. - You have fired before in the Army? - Not much. I was in intelligence. Its choke is full. It'll lock a bird down cleanly. What are we killing? Whatever moves. You know, the club has provided us with pheasants. It's a beautiful bird. Very colorful, very strong, very clever. Knows how to hide. So now we flush them out. Bishop, you've been very kind about the business of my disbelief. Thank you. Well, you have until death, my son. Although a little advanced booking is not a bad idea. - Hi. - You have meet Stellian? Yeah. He stood watch, I guess, at Florian's house. He came to us directly from the Romanian wrestling team. He defected after winning the... The light heavyweight division. So far, he has made no progress with his English... but he's beaten all our nuns in Greco-Roman. Bishop, I wonder if might ask you a question... that has nothing to do with religion. Well, I'd be very happy to hear such a question. Well, last night Florian and I were playing pool... and I couldn't help but notice he did not have a tattoo on his arm. I mean, didn't everybody in concentration camps... get tattoos on their arms or their wrists? Not all of us had numbers. - You were in a concentration camp? - I was. Not the same camp, nor for as long as Florian. The fact remains the Nazis kept that little habit for Jews... and what they considered other sub-humans. We were just their enemies. Come to my study, Michael. Thank you, sir. Now, if you would like to... why don't you tell me? What's troubling you, Michael? The business of the tattoo... is a symptom, I feel, not the disease. Am I right? Bishop, do you know what happened at a place called Kayatsa? Yes. There was a massacre of Jews, a terrible massacre. Men, women and children. When I asked Florian about it... he told me it was a site of a concentration camp. Kayatsa was a village. There was a labor camp nearby... and the massacre took place just outside the village. Michael, why do you ask this? Since I've been here, I've been... contacted, I suppose. By the man who has painted Florian's wall? Right. And Florian has told you about such men? How they've hounded him? - Right. - And you do not believe him. - No, it's not that I don't believe him-- - Michael... tell the truth and shame the devil. - My mom used to say that. - Michael... why do you not believe Florian? Have you thought about that? I ask you this because I think you are in a very delicate position. Irina is a wonderful young woman... and clearly you love her very much, and you came here to meet her father... who, I need hardly tell you, loves her very much also. Excuse me, are you saying that I'm jealous of Florian? \ Michael, what I'm trying to say is that a human mind... is a very elaborate mechanism... that operates sometimes outside its own knowledge. I cannot answer all your questions, but I can do two things for you. This man who has been contacting you... perhaps he knew someone in Kayatsa. Many died there, many more remember... or perhaps he's just a Communist from the old regime. Things are still difficult for the country. They're still trying to sow dissent among the emigre community. Maybe simply he's a crazy man. We got plenty of those. Whoever he is, whatever his motives... I'm going to show you that this man's allegations... concerning Florian Stroia are incorrect. I'm going to reveal to you a copy of an FBI report... on Florian. I have no right to do so, so I depend on yourjudgment... to make sure that I'll never regret it. Is that understood? A promise is best spoken out loud. I promise that you won't have any cause to regret it, Bishop. Here. "The Euro investigation concludes that the alleged... "Nazi collaboration has not been substantiated. "It is therefore the opinion ofthe Bureau that Florian Stroia... "be permitted to remain in the United States without prejudice." Thank you for your trust, Bishop. Now that second thing. I told you that I've known Florian for a long time. And he's one ofthe most opinionated, arrogant... manipulative sons of bitches I've ever met. Do not give him any reason to oppose your marriage to Irina. Do not give him any reason to oppose your marriage to Irina. If he did, he could exert a terrible power over her. - This, too, I'm telling you in trust. - Thank you, Bishop. Actually, he reminds me of you in certain ways. He's a bit more of a warrior than I'd see myself. I don't know, I think you're quite the samurai in some departments. Are we about to break the rules under your father's roof? Maybe we should talk about that. I was right. You are quite the warrior, lover. All for my Snow Queen. - Who told you that? - Catherine. She said you put Glenn through the wringer. Do you think he ever got over you? Could you? No. I met a psychologist once in New York. He told me that I had lowered my sexual energy... so I wouldn't have to look for a man to compete with my father. What did he say about your mother? He didn't say anything about my mother. Little boys want to do it with their mothers. Little girls want to do it with their fathers. But I'd rather do it with you. Good answer. Why don't we go visit your mother's grave? And maybe take some flowers. - Her grave? - Yeah. I know I always feel good when I put flowers on my mom's grave. I don't know where her grave is. You don't know where she's buried? I don't get that. You don't have any pictures of her... you don't talk about her... and you don't know where she's buried. She left us, Michael... when we needed her the most. She just left. She left. She walked out? You mean she might not be dead? She's dead to me... and to my father. She abandoned us. And I haven't forgiven her for it. She must've had her reasons. I mean... a mom just doesn't leave her child without reasons. Don't confuse your mother with mine, Michael. It won't bring either ofthem back. Snow Queen is certainly looking radiant tonight. I'll tell her you said so. Wonderful what a motel shot can do for a girl, isn't it? What did you say? I can tell when somebody's got the "just fucked" look. And I know Irina wouldn't dare in Florian's house. Glenn and I used to have to go out of town to make sure we weren't spotted. My mother had a sixth sense about that sort ofthing. Now, Glenn... he wouldn't notice if I went to a motel six days a week. Did you know lrina's mother? Are we changing the subject by any chance? Yes and I'm just curious. I was just a kid, but I knew her. She was a nice lady. She wasn't Romanian, but that's not all bad. What was her name? - Emily. - Emily what? - Emily Stroia. - No, her maiden name. I don't know. Ask Irina. No, wait, I do. It was Bellefontaine. She was French-Canadian. - Did you like Florian's song? - Yes, I did. - He's got a good singing voice. - Yes, he does. I will let you two to discuss Florian's voice. Remember what I told you, Michael. What did she tell you now? That if you couldn't get enough from me, she'd be happy to help out? She wasn't really that specific. Catherine's the biggest tease in town. I wouldn't take everything she said so seriously. Good morning, sir. \ What do you want? What? The truth be known. He must be punished. And you want me to believe you know the truth? I know one truth, but nobody wants to hear it. All right. Let's hear the truth. - Come on, let's hear it. - Get in. Why don't you get out? Because it's easier to get shot standing on the street. You want to know or you don't? My name is Jakob Bercovici. I have come to find Florian Stroia. And you're going to tell me he was involved in the Kayatsa massacre, right? So you know it's a massacre. You've been doing some research. What I know is he had nothing to do with it. He was cleared by the FBI. Cleared by the FBI, well then, that's all right, huh? What, you think everybody is lying except you? The government, the FBI? You think you know your government? Do you know... that after the war, they let in all kinds of Nazis, butchers... criminals, executioners, anyone... if he said he was an anticommunist? And your FBI helped them. Bishop Dancu believes he's innocent. Octavian Dancu, priest to the Iron Guard. Do you accuse everybody who doesn't agree with you? - I don't need Dancu. - Slow down. I don't need anybody to agree with me. Watch out. Get on your side ofthe road. God damn it! You Okay? I was at the Kayatsa massacre. You were there? It was early in the morning, cold... and suddenly, men are breaking into my house. They drive us out into the street, they chase us to a field. And my mother, she says to me: "Run, Jakob, run to the trees." And she slapped me. And so I ran to the trees. And then I look back... and the men ofthe Iron Guard are beating everybody with their clubs. They stripped them naked and they cut them with their knifes. And then, they shot them and they fell on the ground. And the snow, it turned red from the blood. My sister's, my mother's. All this I saw myself. I was there. And so was Florian Stroia. He was in charge ofthe Iron Guard. He gave orders. He was there. Michael, is that you? Yeah, it's me. - You must be hungry after all your running. - No, I'm fine. - Where's Florian? - He's with Bishop Dancu. There's some kind of political rally tomorrow night and Florian's arranging. Why? What's the matter? You know people should not run before they've eaten. No, I'm fine, Vera. Is there a car I can use? - Why, where do you want to go? - Just want to take a drive. There's Florian's van. It is in the garage. I'll get the key. - Is something the matter? - No, I'm fine. - Here is the key to the van. - Thank you. And you, you come and have some breakfast. - What do you want? - What? What do you want? I'm looking for Sam Murray. What good you think that's gonna do you? I've been reading his articles on Florian Stroia in The Courier. Sam Murray doesn't write for The Courier anymore. - Are you Sam Murray? - Get your ass off my porch. I met a man who says he saw Florian Stroia at a massacre. So Stroia offed a few hundred innocent Jews... one chilly Romanian morning. Nobody's perfect. You're Sam Murray, right? I'm what's left of him. Get in. \ What were they exactly, these legionnaires? Not your average Romanian. Your average Romanian is not a bad guy. But these legionnaires were an idealistic bunch. This is the guy that founded the movement back in the '20s. One of their symbols was... a cross with a Bible on one side and a gun on the other. Another one was the Archangel Michael wielding his sword of vengeance. During the war, in the Iron Guard, some ofthe more fanatical ones ran amuck. Declared open season on Socialists, pacifists, homosexuals... but particularly the Jews. And Florian Stroia was a part of that? He was a legionnaire, a member ofthe Iron Guard. And now you know somebody who saw him in Kayatsa. He said he was in Buchenwald. He was at Buchenwald, not in Buchenwald. He was billeted there... because the Germans thought the Iron Guard was nuts... that they were uncontrollable, even by SS standards. So how did Florian get into the US? He just joined the crowd. We couldn't liberate those fuckers fast enough. Scientists, engineers, chemists, anybody who could build us a bomb. You remember Wernher von Braun, the ex-Nazi who headed up NASA? "L aim for the stars, but sometimes I hit London." You're kind of bitter, aren't you? If you've been looking up history's assholes as long as I have, you'd be bitter, too. Tell me something. Why are you so interested in the stories about the good old days? Iam going to marry Florian Stroia's daughter. Congratulations. She believes in her father's innocence. She wouldn't be the first person to look a bunch of facts in the face... and see what she wanted to see. Did you ever meet her? No. But I met her mother. Now she quit toeing the party line. She was even going to take the girl back up to Canada. Then she cracked up. Went into some kind of clinic. I never heard what happened. Why didn't you follow it up? I got sidetracked. I got real interested in hospitals and traction... and rehabilitation therapy and what it takes to make it through the night. I'm sorry. What happened? I learned how to do it with alcohol. Emily Stroia was taken to a clinic called Mercheson House. It's up north somewhere, near the Canadian border. It seems we were not so strict in those days about... committals, review boards... regular visits, multiple commitment signatories and that sort ofthing. Here she is. "Emily Bellefontaine...Straia?" Stroia. "Admitted: April 12, 1968. "Released: August 22, 1971." She was committed by her husband, Florian Stroia. Three and a half years. Do you know where she went then? She went to the county coroner's office... from there to autopsy, and from there to the cemetery. She was released dead? Her body was released, yes. What happened to her? She opened her carotid artery with a fork, it would appear. My God. What was wrong with her? I don't know. It was her fourth attempt, so we may assume she was serious. \ You have a lovely daughter, Emily Bellefontaine. Once upon a time, when I was younger... we had a birthday party at the church. The old one. And Irina gets up to sing me a very special song, you remember? While she is singing, this little dog... wanders in from who-knows-where up onto the stage. Of course, she does not see it. Everybody started to laugh, I had no idea what was going on. It's a very serious, sad song... about a marriage between a goat and a deer. But she just keeps on singing. Jakob, it's Michael Rossi. Michael, I wait for you to call. I'm coming to see you with someone. I want you to tell them what you told me. - This is not the police? - No, it's not the police. The police are not to be trusted. Meet me at the Torch Motel, I'll be about half an hour. Irina, will you do something for me? - What? - Just come with me, no questions. All right? - Say yes. - Okay. Wouldn't you agree? That's why only once a year angel food with poppy seed-- - We're going out for a little while. - Now? But we'll be back soon. Well, drive carefully. I feel really terrible just walking out on everybody. - Where are we going? - We're going to the Torch Motel. Michael, I really don't think this is the time. It's not for that. - I want you to meet someone there. - Who? We're gonna meet the man who said he knew Florian from Kayatsa, you remember? - I don't want to hear this. - His name is Jakob Bercovici. He was there. He saw it all. He was seven years old. He saw Florian, honey, he recognized him. How can he know? He was a child. He's mistaken. He's lying. Just listen to him, if you don't believe him-- You'll forget all about it? If you don't think he's telling the truth, yes. I'll forget the whole thing. That looks like his car. We're losing him. - I think it's him. - Who? - Michael, where are you going? - Who's in charge here? - Stay back. - I know him. Knew him. He's dead. - Oh, my God! - This man's name is Jakob Bercovici. - I think I know how this happened. - What's your name? Michael Rossi. Who's in charge here? - Wait right here. - All right. Michael, what are you doing? Irina, I don't think this is an accident. We're on our way to see him, and suddenly he can't tell you anything. What are you saying? He picked up the phone, he called somebody. - Who picked up the phone? - Your father. - That's crazy. - He's put us under surveillance. - You hear what you're saying? - Tell me this: How did Catherine know we'd been to a motel the other day? - Did you tell her? - Of course not. - But she knew. - Michael Rossi. - We have to take you to the precinct. - Why? Hey, listen up. - Am I under arrest? - Yeah. - What's the charge? - Shoplifting. - This is bullshit. - Wait a minute. Where are you taking him? Please. Michael! Let's go. Coffee? Good choice, that's bad coffee. I don't give a shit about your coffee. - Why are you holding me? - You know the charge. Florian Stroia is who you ought to have here... asking him who he got to kill Jakob Bercovici. We got a name, a lot of names there. You're getting ahead of me here. You said Jakob, "Jacob Bercovici," yeah. He's a lousy driver. He was involved in two moving violations since he got into the US. His license is questionable. The road was slick. Tire marks indicate that he swerved and lost control. When we get the lab report, we'll know if he was drinking. - That's bullshit. - No, that's police work. How did you get me in here so quick? They phoned you. Admit it. Don't get so paranoid about Romanians, they are good people. All right. What about the ones who got Sam Murray? - You know Sam? - Yeah, I know Sam. Who got him? - There's always some rotten apples. - Who got him? We didn't catch them. So, if I were you... for safety's sake and for the health of your legs... I think you ought to stay right here tonight. You're bullshit. You crossed the line here. And if I can prove that Florian Stroia... was part ofthis probable accident, I'll arrest him. It's all I can do to keep dickheads like you from getting the shit beat out ofthem. I've never seen him like this. The things that he's saying, the accusations. Irina, come. Sit down here, please. Come. Who is this Bercovici person? Someone I must have known a long time ago. Was he trying to hurt you? No... Ithink... I must have hurt him. I thought we had laid to rest... this ghost, but it is not so. Ihoped... I would never have to speak to you this way. I would never have to speak to you this way. When there was the madness in Romania, I was in the middle of it. But it wasn't like what Michael said. It couldn't have been. It was a different time. A different world. There was no pity then. But you weren't one ofthem. You wouldn't have been. There was only... those who killed... and those who were killed. L--- was not killed. What I did was what I thought I had to do. Then there was a reason, an explanation. Reason was dead. What I did was wrong. - You did those things. - Some ofthem, yes. But you told me it was all lies. That was the lie. How could you? Why did you lie? Lie to me? How could I tell a child such things? The child whom I loved with all my heart and soul. I told your mother, she left us. I tried to explain then. I was a different man. I don't know what to do. I will answer to God for what I have done. But I have been... as good a man, and as good a father... as I know how. In this I have done no wrong. I love you more than life. It will break me to lose you. - You catch anybody yet? - Bercovici had been drinking. Coffee, a lot of coffee. Michael, come on. Get out of here, go back to New York. - Only if I can get my girl to go with me. - She's waiting for you. She put up bail. Not that we would've held you. - Thanks. - Yeah. Look, Michael... Sam Murray was a friend of mine. If I could catch the bastards that crippled him, I would. These are dangerous people, don't ever forget that. - Excuse me. Department of records, please? - Third floor. - Hi. - Hi. Thanks for bailing me out. Anytime. I guess we have some talking to do. - You want to do it here? - Not particularly. - We could go home. - No, I don't think so. - Florian really wants to talk to you. -l'll bet he does. I bet he's got a story pretty well rehearsed by now. He told me he was involved in the Kayatsa massacre. He said that? It wasn't easy for him to say, or for me to hear. Easy? He murdered women and children. You weren't there, you don't know how things were. What does it matter how things were? How does it have to be before it's all right to kill? -It's in the past, it's done. -lt's done? And now that he's told you you can forget about it? - He suffered enough for it. - He suffered? He lives in a big house and gives away TV sets to old ladies. He drives around in a big car and he sings at parties. - Tell me how he's suffered. - He has. - He's different now, it over. - No, it's not! What about Bercovici? You can't tell me Florian had a man killed... so I wouldn't find out what he himself was willing to tell me. Florian told you because... he knows you won't use it against him. And you won't, will you, Irina? No, I won't. And you're going to ask me not to do anything about it either, right? I think Florian wanted to ask you that himself. I'd like to hear that. If you're going to listen to him, Michael, you can't judge him in advance. Otherwise there is no use to it. Please, it's very important. Not just for Florian, but for you and me, for us. Please? Yeah. Come up. - You coming? - No. Sit down, Michael. I don't think so. Makes you feel too much like I'm being interviewed. Why don't you just tell me what it is you have on your mind? I have Irina on my mind. - Not the 800 who died in Kayatsa? - No. Nor the six million in the Holocaust... nor the 10 million that Stalin killed... nor the 17 million killed by the Spanish flu. Just Irina. Just one person still living. Not any of the dead. What about Emily Bellefontaine? \ She was your wife. Irina's mother. Did you care about her? You are a very outspoken young man, Michael. Let me be just as forthright. I'm not a man with whom you can take liberties. I welcomed you into my home... even though you're not suitable for my daughter. She would have found it out in good time. Now she finds it out. In bad time. But you will not hurt her. And you will not come between me and her. She will not let you. And I will not let you. Do not mistake me. What happened then... you cannot understand. Nor do you know what you would have done... during those times. If you can put out of your mind the past, which neither concerns you... nor is comprehensible to you... I will not prevent you from marrying Irina. But if you cannot or will not... then there is no place for you in my house... or in lrina's life. You really think you can dictate those terms to me and Irina. Where do you get the idea that you own her... or can silence me? You are free to go. You were a murderer. God damn you! You are a murderer. A murderer and a liar. Irina, I think we should leave. - You don't understand, Irina. - Yes, I do. No, you don't. You don't know about your mother, how she died. - That doesn't matter. - It matters to me. All that matters is us and you are tearing us apart. No, Irina, your father is tearing us apart. - Why are you doing this? - Because it's right. What are you suddenly, the conscience of the world? When did you care about the Jews before? I care about us. I care about our children. About the kind of people they'll be, and I don't want this man... -as a grandfather. - This man is my father. Honey, let's leave here. I love you. Let's just go. We came here to plan our wedding. And now you are making our divorce. You can't stay here. He'll do to you what he did to your mother, do you realize what he did? He locked her up in a mental institution... -until she stuck a fork in her neck-- - Stop it! You're not gonna listen to the facts, are you? - You don't care. - I do care. Why can't you understand? Florian is my father. I love him. Did you think I could stop loving him? He is in my life, Michael, I can't just destroy him. Michael, please... don't make me choose. You have chosen. Florian over your mother. Florian over the truth. Florian over me. If you believe that, what are you waiting for? I blew it. The way I told her was all wrong. The way I told her was all wrong. There may not be a right way to tell somebody... their father is a mass murderer. No, I wasn't on her side. There's some way I can prove to her what's going on. They were cold-blooded killers and they still are. Look what they did to you, Sam. - Look what they did to Bercovici. - Yeah, and to a whole lot in between. They've been keeping an enemies list for a long time. Those files in the basement. There must be something in there to show her... this isn't all just ancient history. An enemies list like you said. Blood oaths, Nazi training camps for kids. - All part ofthat racist bullshit. - Yeah. Why don't you get good and drunk and tomorrow things'll look a lot worse? - Something that'll prove it to her. - Michael, stop it! You can't just prowl around over there at Dancu's... and think that all they'll do is call the cops. You don't get it. I lose her, I lose everything. Bullshit. That's just whiskey talk. No. It's the truth, Sam. Now, I could go down to some bar, I could get drunk... I could pick a fight, smash the goddamn place up... -or I could go get those files, right? - No. - Right? - No. Right? \ Irina? Are you all right? Irina, don't frighten me. Tell me you are all right and I will go away. I'm not all right. I think you must come with us tonight. I don't want you to be alone. Your pain will pass. I know. You sure you wanna go through with this? Maybe the crowd will help. I mean, they might not notice me. I'll be back. You look good, Irina, as usual. Thank you, Bishop. Would you excuse me, please? - Is she going to be all right? - She will find her strength. Boy, you really are a mess. Yes, I am. I'm sorry, honey. You just gotta let him go. Look, he didn't fit in. Florian raised you to be royalty. Michael was a commoner. It just wasn't meant to happen. If he endorses you... you will be well and truly endorsed with this community. That's what a politician likes to hear. Allow me to introduce my daughter, Mr. Marshall. Kenneth, please. Irina, this is Kenneth Marshall, who I confidently expect... will become our new Congressman. - How do you do? - Good to meet you, Mr. Marshall. It is with great pleasure, my friends... that I introduce Kenneth Marshall... and ask that this community extend its support and its votes... for him to become our next representative... in the Congress of the United States. \ Now that Romania is experiencing the first tastes of freedom... it should make us here in the United States more aware... of our own traditions ofdemocracy, traditions that we must vigilantly preserve. Hi. Damn it! Now freedom doesn't mean you can do anything you want. Just as when raising a child... we encourage him or her to be independent. Yes. But within the realm of respect, discipline, and the laws of the land. You can'tjust go around shouting "fire" whenever you want. Or burning the flag. Or mocking the country and its leaders. This isn't freedom. This is anarchy and it leads to dictatorship. And as ethnic Americans from Eastern Europe... you personally know the dangers of such regimes. As avid anticommunists... you have held on to the rights ofpeople to determine their way of government. And when you vote for me... I will exemplify these ideals in this state, and in Washington. Thank you very much. Irina. What's going on? Your father is taking care of it. Stop him. Irina, please. - Tata. - Stay back. It's nothing. Michael! Irina! \
