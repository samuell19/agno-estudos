Give it to me. You've got it, and I want it back. Aah! Let's try this again here. Where is my money? Aah! Timothy, I'm sorry. I gotta stake out the Targesons' apartment again tonight. Can't it wait just one night? No, it can't wait one night, not if I want to get paid. Have you looked outside lately? I think this whole global warming thing hasn't quite made it to Albany. Donald... Damn it, it's my job. It's what I do. You know this. I know, I know, but... But... But what? Well, maybe it's time you considered another line of work. And give up skulking in dark alleyways and spying on cheating housewives? Come on! We can't make dinner plans with our friends. I don't remember the last time that we went out to a movie. And it's dangerous. Some nights I can't sleep, worrying that someone's out there bashing your brains in. You worry? Of course I do. Well, that's it. There's just one thing to do. You gonna quit? No. I'm gonna take you to a movie. Tomorrow night. I don't even know why I bother. Come on. Just let me finish one more divorce case. I'll take a few days off. Promise? I promise. Let's go someplace warm, please. We can frolic on the beach, maybe. I like it when you frolic. More than when I skulk? Much. Tim, you're not gonna believe what... Senator. Uh, sorry to interrupt. Not at all. We were just... Morning, Senator Platt. Don. Nice tie. I've got some terrible news, Tim. The state appropriations committee just pulled the Safe Zone program. What? They can't. Yeah. How much? All of it. $3 million. It's the thing with the kids. At-risk youth. Runaway shelters, after-school programs... I'm sorry. I know this is your pet project. There are 13 centers across the state. There are hundreds of kids. They can't just shut them down. You have an idea? Here's every donor who's given us anything in the past three years. If I have to, I will call every one of them until I find that money. I love it when he gets like this. My little robotic pit bull. Yeah. And then he gets that 'don't screw with me" edge to his voice. Yeah, and if he gets really upset, you'll see... 'cause the hands go... And he sort of pulls this? Yeah. Mm-hmm. See? See? Enough. Enough. You two aren't allowed to talk to each other, ever. Hmm. Call me if you need help. I love you. Go get 'em. Arf arf arf! Mifburns Industries. This is Ann speaking. Hi, Ann. It's Tim Callahan with Sandra Platt's office. Oh, hi, Mr. Callahan. I need to speak with your point person for charitable donations. That would be Richard Sears. Let me transfer you. Please hold. Mmm! Try Valium with your morning coffee. Takes the edge right off. Kenny, I gotta tail Arnie Targeson's wife again tonight, so let's find out when her last appointment is, okay? All right. You seem a little cranky. Everything okay? Ah, it's Timothy. Thinks I should change jobs. Quit the private investigation business? Well, let's face it. All I really do is ruin people's lives for a hundred bucks an hour plus expenses. I may as well be a tax collector. Well, honestly, Don, I mean, not to criticize, but you're doing a lot of things wrong. Wrong? "Client contracts should be executed "before any actual work begins. Retainers should be cashed..." I get retainers. "While the remainder of the fee is placed into an escrow account." Private Investigator Training Seminar? I started a night class. Detective school? I plan to be fully prepared when you make me partner. I work alone. And that's working well for you, huh? Okay. Out. Out, out, out! You've raised $220,000 in less than five hours. That's a real accomplishment, Tim. Not when you're still $2 1/2 million short. You know, I haven't seen you this worked up about anything in a long while. This isn't just political, is it? No, not really. I guess you could sort of say it's the settling of a debt. All right. I'll see if I can call in a few favors. We'll go after the money till we get it. Thank you, Sandra. Good night. Good night. Tim Callahan? I was... till the heart attack. But you're Tim Callahan, right? Sorry. Have we met? You called today looking for money. Oh, you mean the... The Safe Zone program. I'm an attorney. I represent an anonymous donor. He wants to stay that way. Well, that's no problem. The Safe Zone program is an incredible... It helps kids, right? Yes. That's what he wants to do... help. You have to promise me this money gets directly to the kids, not caught up in a lot of bureaucratic red tape. This money needs to do some good. How much money does your client want to donate? 3 million. Dollars? It has to stay anonymous. Look, we can't accept that kind of gift without knowing where it came from. No! Don, I need your help! Tim! Timothy! Don! Oh! What is going on? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm... I'm fine. Oh, God, Don, it was terrible. Whoever it was had a gun. And I think he killed that guy! What guy? That's what we'd all like to know. It figures you'd be mixed up in this, Strachey. What's going on? Someone was killed? Well, so says your boyfriend, only we got no ID, no body, and no vehicle. He said he was an attorney. You know this guy? Well, no. He... He said he had... he had a client who was gonna invest some money, but... And then this motorcycle came outta nowhere... Yeah. And you didn't get a plate number, and you didn't get a good look at the driver, maybe? No. Look, I told you, it happened so fast. It was dark. He had a helmet on him, and he pulled out a gun... Calm down. Look, Detective, I gotta take him home. Sure, fine. Doesn't look like I got a crime scene here anyway. You two belong together. You know, he kind of scares me. Just do what I do. Picture him on the beach in Provincetown wearing nothing but a thong. See? It works every time. You okay? You need to go to the doctor? No, I'm fine. I just... The only prescription I need is you and a stiff martini. That I can do. With that low-pressure system moving in from the Midwest, we're expecting this cold weather to continue through the week with showers and freezing rain possible, making our roads through the greater Albany region pretty treacherous. So if you have to get in your car today, be careful. You don't wanna know. I've been thinking about that $3 million. That's an awful lot of thinking this early in the morning. He said he was an anonymous donor. You think maybe that was who killed him? We don't know he's dead. He could've just run off. I saw him go over the side. Yeah, you know, you did. From now on, no going in the parking garages alone. In fact, no more going anywhere by yourself. Well, you don't think that whoever did this would come after me? Okay, upstairs. Get dressed. I'm taking you to work. I'm a marked man. Mmm. Yes. You know, I was thinking, with everything going on, maybe we should take our vacation a little early this year. Ah, but I love winter in New York. 'Cause you're insane. Oh, I get to wear sweaters, scarves, and gloves. Tim? Fires in the fireplaces. Tim? Yeah? That the guy? Oh, my God! I'll take that as a yes. He's... He sure is. Don? Yeah. They know where we live. They sure do. Inside. I'll call Bailey. Well, at least this time you actually got a corpse. Yeah. And what exactly is it they want back? I don't know. Are you playing games with me, Strachey? Look, whatever it is, we don't got it. Yeah, well, I don't think whoever did this is gonna like that answer. There was no ID on the guy or nothing? We'll check his prints, see if he's in the system, flash his picture around a little. And we'll be taking the car, too. Come on. How am I gonna go to work? Well, it's part of an ongoing investigation. If it doesn't fall apart before we get it back to the lab. I need to get to the office. No, you don't. You're not going there. Not until we figure out what's going on. It's the state senate building. I'll be safe. You stay indoors until I figure out a car or something to come get you. You promise? Yes, yes, yes, yes. Hey, Bailey, make yourself useful, huh? Give him a uniformed escort. I would do it myself, but I seem to be without transportation. We look like a taxi service to you? Hey, Morris. Hmm? Drop him off, would you? Well, I should probably ride along with you. So tell me again, exactly what did this guy say to you? He said that he had $3 million from somebody who didn't want to be named, and that it was very important to him that the money went to the kids. He say why? He didn't have a chance. I need a car. Not exactly a news flash. Rent me a car. What kind? Whatever's got the best heater. One hot car coming up. Strachey. Yeah. Oh, y-yeah, I'm on my way. I gotta go down to the station. What's up? Hey, Kenny, get outta here, okay? Just take the day off. Don't come back till I call you. Are we in some kind of trouble? Aren't we always? You ID'd the guy? Yeah, it wasn't hard. District attorney knows him. I know him, too. I just haven't seen him in over 12 years. Who is he? Jake Lenigan. Mean anything to you? His grandfather was, uh, Brian Lenigan. Lenigan & Lenigan? Lawyers to some of the biggest names in the city. So Jake... I take it he's family. He worked there? Yeah. Him and his brother Eric. His father worked there, too, until he was murdered 12 years ago. Supposedly by their mother. She disappeared during the investigation. She hasn't been seen in over 10 years. You don't think she came back to knock off her kid, do you? No. No. Joan Lenigan was one of the most decent people I ever met. Other than the "killing her husband" part? She was never charged with the murder. Wasn't enough evidence. You seem pretty sure about that, bub. It was my case. I spent a lot of time with her. How come she disappeared? You sure you have no connection to Jake Lenigan? No. How about your boyfriend? Met him for the first time last night. I'm more interested in who Jake's anonymous donor was. Another Lenigan murder. Things are gonna get ugly. I understand. You've selected your charities for the year. But I... I think if you just reconsider this particular project, you'll find... Yes. Yes. Yes, I know. Money is tight right now. But the Safe Zone project is very important for our young people. And, really, aren't our children our most valuable natural resource? Jim, I'm gonna have to call you back. Mm-hmm. What the hell is this? You said you needed a car. A car, not the Batmobile. Didn't they have a class in your little PI school about blending in, being inconspicuous? That must've been the night I skipped to go to the Madonna concert. Indulge. Madonna still does concerts? See that? That's a GPS navigating system. It'll show you the routes. It's linked to... Hey. Magnum P.I. Hey, honey. Okay, slow down. Take it easy. I'm... I'm on my way. Don, you just need to, um, unlock the... unlock the door. I... Don't worry. I'll take the bus. Morning. What is going on? Just get me home. Lock it. What is going on? Tim? Timo... Will you talk to me? What... What is in the envelope? Timothy, you are freaking me out. What... Shh! What's going on? Tim! Eurobonds? 3 million dollars' worth. Just like cash. Completely untraceable. I take it you didn't get a raise. Where did this come from? They were delivered to my office this morning. I want to hire you. What? To find out where those came from. You are not thinking about keeping this money. I thought about it... all afternoon! The attorney... He wanted the kids to have it. The Safe Zone needs the money! It's obviously stolen. We don't know that. Somebody got killed because of it! Which means it's dirty money! Which means in the right hands, that money could go to do so much good! Here. Wh... What? Your retainer. Now, we should have some kind of PI/client confidentiality privilege... Less speech right there. This is the largest retainer I've ever received. Just... Just find out about them for me. If it's stolen, we'll give it back. But if we can use this to help the kids... Please. Strachey. You have something that belongs to us, yeah? Who is this? You'll save yourself a lot of problems by returning it. I-I'm sorry. I don't actually know what you're talking about. But maybe if you wanted to tell me, I could... Wrong answer. Go! Oh, shit! Cover the back! We should just give them the money. They'd kill us anyway. It's our only leverage. Get the fire ladder now. Go! Don, that's a long way down. Yeah, it's better than a bullet. Get down there now! Don't move. Ah! Hurry. Go! Donald, hurry! Tim, go to the car. Uhh! Good job. Now car. Yes, one king bed. Thank you. You said that we should take our vacation early. I didn't think you meant Albany. All because someone is trying to kill me. You really gave that guy quite a wallop. I did, didn't I. Yes. I didn't even think. I just reacted. Amazing what'll happen when your body wants to stay alive. My whole body feels like it's... It's tingling or something. It's adrenaline. It'll wear off. Is this what it's like for you? This sort of rush? Sometimes. I think I get it. Yeah? Get what? Why you love what you do. It's... Okay. Okay. It's intoxicating. Tim, you, martini. Me, work. I got to go. I'm sorry. Mm-hmm. Tomorrow. Tim! Wha... Or I'll get my shovel. We got to get guys to shoot at you more often. Hello, Lilah. Be sure to smile this time, yeah? I'm like, "What, are you kidding me?" So, I tell him, if you want some blow, you got to blow, you know what I mean? Somerville. That is not a happy face. We didn't get it. God damn it, where's my fucking money? We'll get it back. We know who's got it. Well, we knew who had it before and that didn't help a whole hell of a lot, now did it? 'Cause I still don't have my fuckin' money back! You will. Very soon. Soon. Right. Get out. Get out! Go! Hey. Hey. Morning, bruiser. God, all that really happened, didn't it? Seems so unreal. Sitting here thinking about all this work you're doing on the Safe Zone Project. How much of that do you think has to do with your sister? I was never really there for Kelly when she needed me. I supposed it's kind of ridiculous to think that I can make up for that now. Maybe it's time I start looking for her again, hmm? It's been a while. It's like looking for a needle in a haystack. I know you told me that she was battling with your folks when she left, but what exactly set her off? Oh, who knows? Kelly was always getting into trouble. She was always battling with my parents. In the end I think it was the tattoo. She got this circle with an "A" in the middle of it, the symbol for anarchy, on the back of her neck, and my parents just freaked. I mean, they really came down on her bad. She was only 17. I should have done something about it. I was her big brother. Come on, now, you cannot blame yourself. Well... when she left the house she just disappeared. And that's what happens on the streets... Kids just disappear. Maybe I'm just being naive thinking that we can help these kids. Come on, now. Where's my pit bull? Hmm? I'm not feeling very pittish. You're going to stay here today, all right? Order up some room service, watch some movies, stay here. Where are you going? You're my biggest client. I got to go do what you pay me for. Oh, right. Hi. I'm here to see Brian Lenigan. I'm sorry, Mr. Lenigan has canceled all of his appointments for today. I'm a private investigator, actually. I'm wondering if I could just get a couple minutes of his time. It's okay, Annette. I can talk to him. I'm Brian Lenigan. Ah. I'm really sorry about your loss. What is it you needed, mister... Strachey. Don Strachey. Maybe we could find a private place to chat? I only have a few minutes. This way. We can use the conference room. Strachey. Yeah. You know, the police told us that Jake's body was found in your car. I'm afraid so, yeah. Did you know Jake? I didn't know him. I was hoping you could tell me about him. What was it you wanted to know? Anything that would be useful. What sort of cases was he working on? That's confidential. I'm looking for the person who killed your grandson. I think we want the same things here, huh? You couldn't be more mistaken, Mr. Strachey. You see, Jake gave you something that didn't belong to him, and I need you to get it back to me. Why don't you tell me exactly what you think Jake gave to me. Don't play games with me, son. You don't seem so choked up about the death of your grandson. Hmm? I loved the boy. I was like a father to him after his own father passed away. Was murdered, you mean. You're in way over your head here. You give me back what Jake took, or more people are going to die. Is that a threat? That's a statement of facts. You son of a bitch! You're the reason my little brother is dead. Eric, stop it! I suggest you listen to the old man. You talked him into it, didn't you? Jake never would have done something like this on his own. Enough. Now let him go. What did you say to my little brother? I never saw your brother before I found his body in my car. Yes, you did. The night before, you were at the parking garage with that other guy, talking to the police. I know you were there. What did you say to him? Eric, shut the hell up. You were there. If you care for your life and the lives of the people you love, I would advocate returning what was stolen immediately. Really? Is that your legal advice? Let me ask you this... If something was stolen, how come a bunch of lawyers aren't just going to the cops? Going to the police would be very unwise. The district attorney's an old and dear friend. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. When I get pissed off, I have a very bad habit of doing incredibly stupid things. And I'm getting really pissed off. Yeah. You know how much I don't need the D.A. calling me to complain about you harassing his friends? Look, Brian Lenigan is dirty. You got proof of that? He threatened me. You generally have that effect on people, me included. That's him. Somerville. Yeah. What do you got to do with Somerville? You know him? He's a lieutenant for Frank Zaillian. Organized Crime's been after him for years. Pornography, prostitution, God knows what else. Why haven't they taken him down? He's careful, very well protected, and because anyone who speaks out against him tends to disappear... Permanently. Print it. Hey, it's me. Meet me at the office, all right. Don't go in. Just wait across the street... Hey. Hey, Strachey, I know you like to think you're a tough guy and all, but Zaillian's crew, these guys are out of your league. Detective, it almost sounds like you care. Well, I've got enough corpses on my hands without... Joan. Joan. Hello, Sean. What are you doing? You shouldn't have come back. It's true, then? About Jake? Yes. Come on. There... There's nothing you can do now. You... You need to leave the city before... No. I'm not hiding anymore. We never officially closed the investigation. You could be arrested. I lost the boys, I lost you. I thought there was nothing worse that could happen. And now this. I promise you, I'll find out what happened to Jake. Poor Sean. I was never very good for you, was I? I'm not running anymore. I want to see my son now. All right. Come on. Oh, darlin', you can't do that in here anymore. Right. Times change, hmm? Are you okay? So, um, he was killed when he fell off that building, then? Actually, no. What do you mean? The coroner says the fall didn't kill him. Well, then, how did he die? Three hours after his fall, his neck was broken. He... He was just a teenager when I saw him last, Sean. He was just a boy. Anything? Uh... Uh, location has been under surveillance for 36 minutes. Three vehicles have arrived in that time period... A sky blue Toyota Highlander, license plate number HRC... What are you doing? My instructor said details are important. Kenny, is there anybody in my office or not? Um, no. Doesn't look like it. Good. But what if I'm wrong? I'll shoot 'em. Shh. Nice surveillance work, Kenny. Sorry. Lock the door. Who exactly is after you? I need you to do a little digging. A law firm called Lenigan & Lenigan. See if you can find any connection to a man named Frank Zaillian. Okay. What are you going to do? A little digging of my own into a 12-year-old murder case. Got it. The other name on the deed is a Timothy Callahan. The guy with the bonds? Yeah. We ran his credit cards. One was used last night at this hotel. There's not much. Lenigan & Lenigan keeps a low public profile. A few court cases and some IRS appearances, but mostly they tried to settle everything out of court. And I can't find any mention of this Frank Zaillian. Well, he's connected. I know it. Strachey and Kwon Investigations. Just a sec. I just thought I'd see how it sounded. Hubby on line 1. Hey. Strachey and Kwon? It sounds like a figure skating team. Yeah. I'm about to try our first throw right through the window. I'm bored out of my mind. Just a while longer. We're not finding too much. No records of Lenigan clients, no connection to Zaillian. So we still don't know where the money came from? No, but we're just getting started. What are you going to do? Uh, honey, I'm going to have to call you back. Get back. Maybe I should come back another time? Joan Lenigan. Sean said... Detective Bailey said that I should speak to you. He... He seemed to think that you might know something more about Jake's death. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Come in. I need to know what happened, Mr. Strachey. Uh, let me buy you a cup of coffee. Please, come in. Coffee. No decaf. Excuse me. I'm wondering if you could help me. I'm looking for a friend. I arrests you in the name of the law. Madam, the case is solved. My hero! He must have taken it with him. Are you certain? All of those? For the entire office. We drew your business card from a bucket, and you lucky guys won. Some place I can put these? Um, I-I suppose the kitchen. All the way back. Okay. Pizza! Why don't you come and have a slice? Everyone, come on in. It's free pizza! There's sausage and pepperoni and... and mushroom, cheese. We all love cheese. Have as much as you like. Enjoy! Thank you. Whoever you are. $3 million? Yeah. He wanted it all to go to an organization called the Safe Zone. You have any idea where that money could have come from? No. But Jake wasn't a thief. There wasn't a deceitful bone in his body. Kids grow up, they change. I know my son. He was always... more like me. Then again, you're supposedly a murderer. Now, I know Bailey doesn't think you did it, but I have to tell you in everything that I've read, I never once saw where you said you didn't do it. I'm not ashamed of what I did. I did kill my husband. Daniel was so handsome and successful... and had a very dark side. And anger that didn't come out till after we were married. Mostly I learned to live with it. But then I discovered... he was hitting the boys. Jake showed me horrible bruises and said it had been going on for years. He was 12, Mr. Strachey. And I... I didn't know anything about it. How can a... How can a mother not know? Okay, so what happened after you found out? I confronted Daniel, and he threatened me. He said he would kill me... If I tried to take the children away from him, and I just... I lost control, and... I grabbed a marble bookend, and I hit him. And afterwards I panicked, and I tried to make it look like a burglary. Bailey was the lead investigator. Did you seduce him because you needed someone on your side? You're a jaded man, Mr. Strachey. I prefer to think of it as realistic. I'm sorry. What? You sent me to voice mail? I'm kind of in the middle of something. Well, I'm kind of in the middle of Jake Lenigan's office. What are you doing? Detecting. I found a file with Frank Zaillian's name on it. You broke into his law firm? Well, it seemed like something that you'd do. Just tell me what it says. Did some kind of corporate work for him, setting up offshore companies. Okay, we need to know what kind of companies. What do they do? Looks like internet, mostly. Some media. There are companies in the Bahamas, The Netherlands, Venezuela... Is there an address? They're mostly out of the country. Hold on. There is one that looks like a personal residence. Give it to me. Uh, number 14 Neff Lane. What else do we need? You to get out of there right now. Was that about Jake? The Lenigan law firm. How much do you know about the business they do? N-Nothing. Daniel never shared that part of his life with me. Oh. Well, I'm afraid your family's been working for some very bad people. My son was an honorable young man. If he stole anything, I promise you it was for a very good reason. Hey. Thank you. Oh. You're welcome. Come on, guys. Let's get a move on. We got two shoots tonight. What? Get this done. Get it done. Hey! Well? He was there. Someone must have tipped him off. So what do I pay you for anyway? Hey. Jesus! Over here. This way. Hurry up. It's fucking incompetence is what it is. We've got a man on the hotel. We'll know if they come back. I want to talk to Lenigan, all right? If this fucking prick had better control over his family, none of this shit would have happened. Now find me this Callahan asshole and get me my money back. Thanks. You look pretty young to be in a place like this. You live here? You're not with the crew, are you? I'm more of an independent contractor. Did, um... Did Jake send you? How do you know Jake? Why were you sneaking around? Do you ever answer questions? To a guy that's been sneaking around the hallways grilling me, and has a gun pretty poorly concealed under his jacket, no. I'm almost 16. I live where I want. Besides, you smell like a cop to me. Let's not start calling each other names, now. I'm Don. I'm not a cop. I'm a private detective, and yeah, I know Jake. Is he coming? Jake helping you out with something, somehow? Oh, shit, they got him, didn't they? Is he okay? I told him. I told him that it was too dangerous. Well, what's your name? Lilah. It's pretty. Yeah, do you like it? Frank Zaillian gave it to me. Zaillian put you in the movies? Yeah. I'm a fucking star. I'm going to get you out of here. I tried once, and they hurt me. They're not going to this time. That's what Jake said. Hold it. Lilah. What are you doing? You're supposed to be down in makeup. Get your ass downstairs now. Now! You got to get out of here. They'll kill you, too. You're coming with me. No, I can't. They think I'm trying to leave, then they'll know I helped take all that money. They'll hurt me again. I can't let that happen. They're not going to hurt you. What do you know about these bonds? Well, I told Jake how he could take them without Frank realizing it for a while, but if I hadn't told him, then he wouldn't... Jake was trying to do the right thing, all right? I'm going to help him finish it, but first we got to get you someplace safe. No, wait, wait, wait. Just let me check in case somebody's there, okay? Uh-uh! I wouldn't try that if I were you. Get him. Frank would like to talk to you. Sock him. You know who I am? Yeah, you're a scumbag. Ouch. You hurt my feelings. So you prefer slimeball? Sleazebag, huh? I want my money. I don't know where it is. Give it to me. You've got it, and I want it back. Aah! Ha ha! Hmm. Let's try this again here. Where is my money? The cops have it. Bullshit! If the cops had it, you wouldn't be sneaking around here, You make all this money on kiddie porn, or is that just a sideline for you? Hey, I just make the movies. Plenty of people lining up to buy them. Fuck you. They're kids. Ahh! They grew up way before I found them. Besides, nobody misses them after I'm done with them. Hmph! See, you might find this surprising, but, uh... I'm actually a very conservative businessman. Very. No loose ends, no... unnecessary risks. And I suppose your lawyers help you with that, huh? Some shell companies move your fucking money around? Well, Lenigan is the best cover-your-ass attorney in the city. Has been for decades. Well, actually... actually except for his grandkid, you know. He, uh, he got all self-righteous on us. So you killed him? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Huh? Ah, yeah. Well, I haven't killed anybody this week. Uhh... You might very well be my first. Because, you see, I... I'm running out of patience here, and I'm getting pretty fucking ticked off, you know? Zap him. Rrrh! So... I'm going to ask you this one more time. Where's my fucking money, you cock-sucking piece of shit? It's so far away, you won't see a penny of it ever again. Yeah. Yeah? Let's just see what your boyfriend has to say about it. Leave him alone! Aah! Hello, handsome. Aah! Don? You want to see Donnie boy alive again, get me my money back. What did you do to him? I haven't killed him yet, but his life's going to be a living hell until you bring me back my bonds! Please don't hurt him. Be outside your hotel in 30 minutes. Hey! You call the cops, he dies. Don't give them anything! Excuse me. I left a package here. I need to pick it back up. Annette, I'm going to go. Be sure to forward the phones. I don't want a repeat of what happened last time. Mom. Eric. Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Mom, Jake is... I know. I know. I know. Get in. You're making this very difficult for me, Lilah. Yeah, well, I can't help it if I have to go again. All right, listen up. I want everybody out of here. What? Huh? But, Frank, we're just supposed to start. We... I don't c... Get them out. You got five minutes. How about it? Guys, that's a wrap! You know the drill. Move it out fast. Come on! Let's get out of here. That's it, guys. You heard the man. If you get your hands loose, I'm going to shoot you. I bet you'd miss. You look pretty stupid to me. Mm-hmm. You know, I'm going to have fun hurting you. I figured I was too old for you, that you like them little kids, huh? Fuck you. That's just for fucking perverts. Don't tell me they don't give you free copies of those movies to take home with you. It'll be a lot healthier for you right now if you just shut the fuck up. I promise you that! Yeah? What about telling me the truth? Your kennel's full of those tapes, isn't it? Fuck you. Uhh! Don? Find something sharp to cut me down. Hurry. Can you get me out of here? Yeah. Come on. Come on. Get out. I said get out! There's no need to be rude. Where's Don? I want to see him. Which piece? Come on. Let's go. Inside. Detective Bailey? I'm calling for Don Strachey. Bring it to me. How about that? They're not here. What? You son of a bitch. I have them. I have them. I do. Just not on me. You fucking pouf, where are they? Close. Very close by. Once Don and I are released, they will be delivered to you. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think this is, some sort of a negotiation? Maybe I'll just cut off one of your hands and see if you bleed out while we wait for it. Well, it's not a perfect plan. But it was the best I could come up with under short notice. Do you want the money or not? Let's just kill one of them, yeah? That's a good idea. I vote for you. Man, this thing is just getting more and more fucked up. Don, let's just give them the money. They'd still kill us. No loose ends, isn't that right, Frank? Uh, Donnie boy, I'm sure we can work something out. Why don't you listen to your girlfriend here, huh? Tim, go! God damn! Get Strachey! Damn it! What... Aah! Come on. Callahan! Go around in front of the house and wait for me. I will come back. What are you going to do? Go get my boyfriend. Callahan. Oh, I'll find you. Don't move! Shit. Shit. Fucking get out of here. Put it down, Strachey. You hear those sirens? They're about a minute away. It's over. Oh, yeah? Well, that gives you 60 seconds to tell me where the money is. Hello, Lilah. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. Somerville! Let's go! Aah! Stop it. You'd better do it. No spine. It's all right. I got enough for both of us. Aah! Don, you okay? Yeah. I'm sorry. For what? I couldn't... I couldn't pull the trigger. That's why I love you. It's okay. Where's Zaillian? I don't know. He heard the sirens and... Lilah. Get... get... No! No, no! Hurry up! Get on the floor. Get on the floor. What? No, please! I don't want... Get on the floor! Lilah? Lilah! Who's Lilah? Girl I made a promise to. There's going to be paperwork on this one, Strachey. Let's find Zaillian and the girl first. Put out an APB. He was heading west. Airport, maybe. Alert the airlines. Come on, he's got so many ways to get out of the country, you know that. Yeah, well, there's not much else we can do. The Lenigans. They know more about him than anyone. Yeah, well, Brian Lenigan's a friend of the D.A. Come on, he's protecting a child pornographer. The D.A. is going to get so far away from him. Connect me through the law offices of Lenigan and Lenigan. Where are the bonds? Kenny's got them. They're in the seat of my ride. I'll go get 'em. You're not gonna be able to keep this money. I don't want it. Not like this. You all right with getting a ride in with Kenny? Not really. Where are you going? Finish this. You'd better goddamn well do something. I swear to God, if I go down, I'm taking your entire family with me! Yeah, I'll be out of the country within an hour. Handle this! Fuck! Fuck! Right now, you're worth more to me alive than dead. But screw around with me, and that changes fast. I should've left you in the street where I found you. I remember when he'd get really angry, he'd... It was like he just lost control. I know. I remember, too. I was so angry at you for what you did. Your grandfather threatened me. I was scared, and then it just seemed like you were probably better off without me. We were, all of us. You're as much to blame as I am for Daniel's death. You created the monster that was your son. I taught him how to be strong. Same way I taught his children. And Jake was strong, wasn't he? Strong enough to do what he thought was right. Eric, we need to talk. The police phoned. They're on their way over here. We're already here, Mr. Lenigan. I see. I hope you don't mind. We let ourselves in. What's he doing here? Strictly as an observer. We need to know how Frank Zaillian travels when he leaves the country. How on earth would we know that? I mean, even if we knew this Frank... You know damn well exactly who he is. Mr. Lenigan, we believe Zaillian is a client of your firm. Anything you can do to help us? Our clients lists are confidential. Shall we call the district attorney so he can explain that to you? Look, you can call whoever you need to. Now we've got a teenage girl whose life is in danger. As a good, upstanding attorney, I figured you'd do everything in your power to help. I'm afraid I can't help. Brian, if you know anything... Shut up, Joan. For God sakes, Frank Zaillian's probably the man who killed your grandson. No, he isn't. Isn't that right, Eric? What? How would I know? Because you killed your brother. It's absurd. Eric, we're leaving now. First I assumed it was Frank Zaillian. That doesn't add up. Zaillian's the kind of guy that would brag about killing your brother and stick his corpse in my car as a threat. He takes what he wants, just like he tried to do. No, this was someone who's afraid of confrontation. It was also someone who knew where Jake might have sent that $3 million, just like you did. Because you were watching me and Tim that night in the parking garage, weren't you? You told me so yourself. How'd you know where to go? I didn't, I just... Your brother tell you what he was thinking about doing? Did you follow him? He was going to destroy the firm. We... Eric! Don't say another word. I understand your father used to hit you and Jake. Did you get his temper? Is that what happened? Are you good and pissed off? Shut up! Slap him around a bit, try to teach him a lesson, huh? I loved Jake! It was an accident. I didn't mean to... Eric, no. No. Must've destroyed your brother to find out that his family was protecting drug dealers, child pornographers. I demand you to get this man out of my office. The only decent person in a whole mess full of vipers, and you killed him. Keep your damn mouth shut! Frank Zaillian's got a girl with him, Eric. A girl just as innocent as you once were. Get him out. Now tell me where to find him. Eric. If you know, if you know... Eric. Tell him. Eric. There's an airstrip. There's an airstrip on Conklin. He flies there so there's no paper trail. You idiot. I'm this man's legal representative. There'll be no further questions. Stay in here. What the hell's going on? Can't you do this any faster? If we have ice on the wings, the plane won't even fly. If this storm gets any worse, we're never going to make it at all. I'll get you to Canada, Mr. Zaillian. Don't worry. Yeah, don't worry. Any units in the vicinity of Forest Road, officer needs assistance. Vehicle on the shoulder westbound, code 83. Joan, you need your coat. Please don't do this. I'm sorry, Joan. Let's go. Let's go. Get up! No! Get up! No, I... Please! Please! No, I don't want... Stop it! Let's go. Shit. No! Donald! Start the engine. Let her go! Like hell. How much is it worth? You got $3 million of untraceable bonds. Fuck you! Show me. Frank, we got to go. They're right here. No! Settle down! Let her go, and they're all yours. How about I just shoot you and keep the money and the girl? How about I put a bullet in the side of your plane and you go nowhere, and I promise you the cops are right behind me. Frank! Hold on! Let's go, Frank. All I want is the girl. Please don't hurt him. All right, bring them up. But I swear to God, if you try something, I'm going to fucking kill you! Stop it! They're right here. Nice and easy. Nice and easy. Here you go. Strachey, 3 million bucks for a throwaway kid? Swear to God, I'll never understand you people. All right, get me out of here. It's okay. It's okay. It's over. It's okay, Lilah, it's going to be okay. Amy. My name is Amy. Dispatch, this is Bailey. Do you copy? Roger, Bailey. This is dispatch, go ahead. Bailey, do you copy? Bailey? Stand by. I thought it was quite convincing that grief-stricken over the death of one grandson, the arrest of another, family patriarch takes his own life. You didn't have to do it. Somebody did, and I'm the only one left. Don't worry. There's no evidence for you to clean up this time. Bye, Sean. This is Detective Bailey. We're going to need a coroner's wagon. The deceased is Brian Lenigan. Roger that. Looks like a suicide. 104. I don't know. Hey, come on. It beats the streets, right? I did okay on the streets. Before Frank found me, I was fine. Please, just give it a shot. I'm sure there are people out there that care very much about you, who'd be completely destroyed if anything was going to happen to you. Maybe just for a few days, then. Excuse me. Hi, this is Amy. Maybe you could show her around, get her started. Proud of you. Thank you. It's going to be okay. We're going to be here for you, okay? Okay, bye. Bye. You see? You do the right thing, and the world just has a way of looking out for you. Yeah, if you give it a good shove in the right direction, maybe. Well, everything turned out for the best. That's what's important. Eric Lenigan donated the money inherited from his grandfather to Safe Zone. We're actually thinking about building a new center and naming it after his brother. So I guess Jake got what he wanted after all. Yeah. $5 million in the building. These centers are going to be running for years. What is Kenny doing here? Come with me. I gave Kenny his first official assignment. Dude, I'll see you in the center. So what did you give him? Shooting pictures of cheating spouses? No, I sent him to pick something up for me. You know how I was telling you how much I admire that tenacious spirit and positive attitude of yours? Yes. I could be something of a pit bull myself. Bullheaded bully. Maybe. There's nothing I like more than finding a needle in a haystack. Is that... Why don't you go say hello to your sister? You all right? She was arrested seven years ago at a protest in New York City. So her tattoo was registered in the criminal tattoo database. What if it wasn't? We would have just kept looking for her. So you still think about quitting the private investigation business? On a beautiful day like this, not today, Kenny. Not today.
