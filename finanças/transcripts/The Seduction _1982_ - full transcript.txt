Brandon, you're a cynic. No, I'm not. I'm just old enough to know that just because you're rich and successful is no reason to be happy. [phone rings] Let it ring. [phone rings] Might be important. Hello? [Woman] Hello? I watched you today. What? [Man] You look beautiful. Who was it? Um, just an admirer. [indistinct chatter, various office equipment] Oh, thanks. [phone rings] Newsrooms. [Man] Lisa, we need Jamie in ten minutes. Okay, hold on one second. Jamie, they're calling you from the stage. Thank you, Lisa. Tell them I'll be there in just a minute. Clear the decks! Bingo, baby. Flowers from Brandon? Nope. They're from Derek. I don't know any Derek. [sighs] [knocking at door] [knocking at door] Yes? Derek, Mrs. Wilson and Ricky are here. Julie, would you mind taking this session for me, please? Okay. [Derek] Thanks. Commercial's up in one minute, Jamie. Let's move it. Okay. Okay, Jamie. A couple things. Your operator on Camera Three's not here today, so be careful. He's a little fuzzy. What happened to Bill? Bill will be right back, don't worry. Great. Zoom in tighter, Camera Two. That's good. Stand by, tape. Here we go. Roll tape. [Man] This is Channel 6 News, the news program watched by more Los Angeles viewers than any other station. Featuring the award-winning Channel 6 News team, with Jamie Douglas, Frank Bilson, and Pete Pierce with sports. And now, here's Jamie Douglas. Good evening. I'm Jamie Douglas and this is the 6:00 report. At the top of the news is the discovery of yet another young victim in the so-called Sweetheart Murders. [Woman] Ricky? Come on, smile for Mom, Ricky. [sternly] Ricky. Come on, smile. Mrs. Wilson, please. I don't wanna go through this again. Ricky, smile. Please, Mrs. Wilson. Hello, Mrs. Wilson. Everything going all right? Hiya, Ricky. [Mrs. Wilson] I'm trying to get Ricky to smile. Oh, I'm sure everything will be just fine. Julie will get exactly what you want. I hope so. If you'll excuse me, can I see you a minute? Sure, excuse me. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMm-hmm. How can anybody smile with a mother like that? Look, I'm gonna run and get a bite to eat. If you finish up in time, you're welcome to join me. Give me two seconds. [phone rings] Newsroom. [Man] May I speak to Jamie Douglas, please? Uh, hold on one second, please. Bobby, phone. They wanna speak to Jamie. [sighs] Thanks. Yes? [Man] Hi. Jamie Douglas, please. I'm sorry, she's on the air; may I take a message? Uh, just tell her Derek called. Is there a number where you can be reached, Derek? No, no. Just, uh-- I'll call back later. Smells like Jamie's got herself a new boyfriend. We'll have more on that story about the disastrous fire in Chicago when we come back. And Pete Pierce will have the sports and Frank Bilson will fill us in on all the weather for this weekend. [Man] Commercial's up. [Man 2] This is the voice of God, guys. We're still ahead in the ratings and I'd like to keep it that way-- What? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hPhone call. Derek. It says, "Derek called." I can see that. Derek who? The same Derek that sent you a bouquet of roses. Hey, come on, Jamie, you can tell me. Who's the new boyfriend? I don't know anyone named Derek. [Man] You're out, Bobby. Well, he sure seems to know you. Go on. Dig in. I can't. It's huge. Aw, come on, now. You deserve it. You know, you've been doing a great job. You really think so? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYeah. Thanks. Mmm. It's so good! I hate it. Have you ever really liked someone, even loved someone, and were afraid to tell them? Yeah. Once. I had a crush on my college art teacher. I-- She was a few years older than I was, but, uh-- well, it didn't matter, I was so crazy about her. You know, for years I took every class she taught. I never spoke to her once. Why not? I don't know. I guess because as long as I didn't say anything to her, she couldn't tell me no. It was safe. You mean you never told her? Nope. You should have told her. I know. Listen. One night if you're not doing anything, would you like to go see a movie or something? Oh, I'd love to if things were different, Julie. You see...there's someone I'm seeing. There's someone I'm going with. Hmm. So. Tell me. Who's the lucky girl? Just someone I know. [Woman on answering machine] Hi, Jamie. This is Robin. Give me a call when you get home. [call ends] [beep] [man on machine] Hi, honey. They upped the deadline on my column, so I'm gonna have to work late. I'll try and get there as soon as I can, okay? Bye. [call ends] [beep] [man on machine] Hi, Jamie? Uh, you don't know me, but my name is Derek. [sighs] I've been trying to reach you all day. Um...did you like the flowers? Look, um...why don't I-- I call you later, when you get home? Maybe we can talk. Okay? [phone rings] Hello. [Derek] Hi. It's Derek. Look, I-- I hope you don't think I'm bothering you, but...I really think we should meet. How did you get this number? [Derek] It wasn't very hard. Who are you? Well, like I said, you don't know me. Look. Why don't we get together for dinner, and, uh...I'll tell you all about myself. Look. Derek. I'm-- I'm sure you're a very nice person. But I don't know you at all, and I don't think meeting you would be a very good idea. So I'm gonna hang up now, okay? Goodbye. [drops phone] [Robin] Hello? Hello, Robin? Can I come right over? [Robin] What's wrong? I'll tell you when I get there. Just have a strong drink ready, okay? Oh, thanks. What rattled your cage? You get a facial by mail or something? It's this guy. He keeps calling me. Following me. Watching me all the time. I haven't the foggiest idea who he is. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h[phone rings] Excuse me, honey. Hello? Uh, this is Derek. Is Jamie there, please? Yes, she is. It's for you. Who is it? He says his name is Derek? Should I hang up? Yes. How would he get your phone number? I don't know. [phone rings] I won't answer it. I will. [phone rings] What do you want? To talk. About what? [Derek] About us. Jamie, you've gotta see me. Would you please just leave me alone? You poor darling. [phone rings] Look, bucko. If you don't leave us alone, I'm calling the cops. Get my drift? [Brandon] Robin. This is Brandon. Oh, shit. It's Brandon. Where are you? [Brandon] Waiting for you. I'll be right there. [hangs up phone] Thanks for the drink. Canteen's open any time, darlin'. [rustling] [warbling bird] Oh! God, Mrs. Caluso. You scared me. Oh, I'm sorry, Jamie. It's just me and Butch, lookin' for a place to poo-poo. Oh. Well... [laughs] \h\h\h\hgood hunting. Bye. Come on, good dog. Come on, good doggie! Momma's little tiger. Come on, good boy. Brandon? Brandon? Brandon? Brandon? Brandon? [running water] \h\h\h\h\h\h\hJamie? [gasps] [panting] No! [panting] I'm sorry. Um... [crying] I just thought you... [Derek] You can't keep your eyes off me, can you? Oh, uh, tell Fred to put these on the VTR. I wanna work this into the sweetheart segment, as soon as possible. Okay. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hThanks. See you later. Rough day with the civilians? Oh, no more so than usual. Now tell Miss Rona. What's the real scoop? Are you seeing this Derek person or what? Yes and no. Does that mean yes? No. Well, which is it? It's "no"! I don't even know this man. Look, as far as I can tell, he picked me up on television. He sent me some flowers. He bothered me on the phone a few times. That's all there is to it. Some of the world's greatest romances started out just that way. Do me a favor. Take your history lesson, Put on your bee wings, and buzz off. Bzz... [sets down bag] Hi. Who are you? I'm Derek. Jamie, listen. I-- I just came to apologize. How did you get in here? It wasn't hard. Look, I didn't mean to scare you last night, with all the phone calls. I'm sorry if I bothered ya. It's candy. It's-- Man, it's just something to let you know that I won't be bothering you anymore. Jamie, I-- Well, I guess I'll let you get back to work. Derek. Thanks for the candy. Handsome devil, isn't he? [elevator bell] Can you spare a dime for an old lover? Hi! I was just gonna call you. That man was here. You mean Derek? Yeah. He brought me this. He came here? To apologize. And, uh, to tell me he won't be bothering me any more. Seems to me, if he wasn't going to bother you anymore, he wouldn't have come here in the first place. [camera shutter clicks] [camera shutter clicks] Oh, shit. [engine starts] [squealing tires] Hey, there. [doorbell] [camera shutter clicks] Hi, Jamie. [camera shutter clicks] What are you doing? Please. Derek! Jamie, I just wanna take your picture. I don't want you to take my picture. I want you to get out of my house. Now I mean it! Stop it! Your eyes are so exciting. Look. I'm not kidding around! Would you get out of here? God, you're pretty when you look at me that way. Derek! Stop it! Get out! Good expression! Get out of here! Leave me alone! Come on! Wet your lips! Damn you! Get away! \h\h\h\h\h\hCome on! Let's get-- Stop it! Will you stop it! Leave me alone! Get out of my house! [Jamie, distant] I'm warning you! [cutting engine] \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hGo ahead! Scream! \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hThat's great! Get out of here! \h\h\h\h\h\hScream as loud as you can! I'm warning you! [slams car door] Damn you! Get out of here! Come on. Scream. Get away! Stop it! Scream as loud as you can! Get off me! \h\h\h\hCome on, Jamie! Keep it up! Loud. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h[Derek] Come on. Scream. [Jamie] Leave me alone! Scream! Stop it! Leave me alone! [jumbled shouting] Oof! Get your ass out of here! Brandon? Who in the hell do you think you are? Brandon! Stop it! Listen to me, slug! No more candy! No more phone calls! No more nothin'! You understand? [gasps] Brandon! Brandon! Stop it! Let him go! [panting] Next time, I won't stop. Thank you, Jamie. I shoulda killed him. [electric stapler] [phone rings] [knocking at door] Come in. Hi, Maxie. Oh, morning, Jamie, Brandon. Oh, still rearranging unimportant papers, I see. Well, that's the price you pay when you become a paper-pusher. Now what was so important that we couldn't discuss it over the telephone? Maxie, there's a man that's been harassing me. I thought he was just an admirer, up until yesterday. The guy's a nut. He's been following her around. He's been making phone calls and giving her presents. And yesterday, he barged into her house and chased her around with a camera. Well, this lover boy, do you know him? Maxie, he's a total stranger. Has he threatened your life, Jamie? No, not really. Jamie...Jamie, you're a public figure. I mean, the guy's probably just an overheated fan of yours. Max, we're not talking about a simple fan. Now this guy is crazy. I think Jamie needs police protection. Police protection? We haven't got anything on this guy. I mean, I could have gotten him for trespassing or something like that. We're not talking about trespassing. This guy is dangerous. He stormed into Jamie's house yesterday and terrorized her. Max, I was gonna kill the guy. Brandon, there's not a hell of a lot I can do about it. I'm sorry. Look, I know this is gonna be difficult for you to understand, but as far as the law is concerned, the guy really hasn't committed a crime. Jamie, if he shows up again, you give me a call. I'll do what I can. I am sorry. Robin, will you just listen to me for one-- All right, all right, stay calm. You could be doing baby pictures. Just give me a minute. I know exactly what I'm doing. [sighs] All right. All right, look, Robin, this is a very expensive location, and I'm not shooting a Rome ad or some commercials for designer jeans; I am creating art. Art fart. Look, Fernando, I work with the worst and I work with the best, and I'm good at what I do. But if you expect me to climb up there and straddle that swing with my ass, you can kiss it, honey. Just kiss it! Okay, Robin... Robin, take it easy. We--we can talk this over, Rob-- Just, will you relax and wait-- Robin? Ro-- I can lower the swing, Robin. [clears throat] Art fart. Guess that puts it nicely. [knocks] Excuse me, Robin Dunlap? Look, if you're one of those schmuckaroos from the ad agency, I'll tell you the same thing I told "Bonsai" Fernando out there. I am not busting my buns on that swing. Tinkerbell I'm not. Well, I'm not from the ad agency. You're not? No. You look like you are. Well, actually, I'm a friend of Jamie Douglas. Oh, yeah? What's your name? Derek. See, there's been a terrible misunderstanding about me. That's why I'm here. I thought maybe you could help me to clear things up. See, Jamie, she-- I don't know, she thinks I'm some kind of crack pot or something, but I'm not. She just hasn't given me a chance yet. You know, I was thinking that, well, if you could talk her into having dinner with me, look, she'll change her mind. She will. Once she understands how much I love her. Okay... I think it's time you took a walk, Romeo. You're afraid of me, aren't you? No. I just can't stand slimy creeps, so why don't you just slime your way out of here, okay? You'll regret that. Shit. [Robin] You know, honey, this Romeo of yours is a heartthrob run completely amuck. If he ever got you into bed with him, he'd probably screw you to death. [Jamie] Look, Robin, I am trying to forget about him. I mean, that's why we're here. Ooh, sor-ry. I guess I better keep my trap clapped if that's what you want. That is exactly what I want. Just clap your trap. Oh, look at those purses. They are gorgeous. Probably cost a fortune. Jamie Douglas. I watch you all the time. Oh, thank you. How 'bout me, soldier? I'm in commercials. I avoid commercials. Did you ladies have anything special in mind? Yes, we'd like something very expensive to get our minds off our troubles, if you know what I mean. I usually seek the advice from a bottle when I have that problem, but maybe this is what you want: a 55-pound cigarette lighter. Good Lord! That's the most ridiculous thing I ever seen. Isn't it? Sells like hot cakes. Well, that's not exactly what we had in mind. It is expensive; solid silver, you know. Will take your mind off all your problems. I don't think so. All right, don't go away. ♪ [music box] This is lovely. You got one that plays jazz, honey? Would you like me to put that on your account, Ms. Douglas? Oh, it's very pretty, but I really don't need it. Um... Okay, thank you very much. Bye! Bye. ♪ [music box] [Man] What's the price for it? [Clerk] It's very modest. She'll greatly appreciate it. [Man] Well, it's a gift for my girlfriend. May I help you? [Man] Okay, I'll take it. Do you have a box? No, no, no, no. Thank you very much. [Man] I think she'll like it. [Man]I'm trying to find something for someone very special. [Man] We've known each other for a while. [Man] I just wanted to get her something that would mean something. [yelps] \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAre you all right? Yeah. Yeah. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh, good. Tell me, is this me? Definitely you. [laughs] It's on sale. I'm gonna buy it. [beep] [Brandon] Hi, honey. I'm going down to the station to see Dr. Weston. I'll see you at home later. [beep] [Man] This is Tony, Ms. Douglas. I fixed the pump on the spa. I'll come back tomorrow and clean the pool. Okay? [beep] [Derek] Hi, Jamie. It's Derek. The pictures I took of you are just fantastic. I can't wait to show them to you. Hello, Jamie. I bought this for you. Well, I watched you admiring it. ♪ [music box] This can be our song. You stay away from me. You can't seem to get it through your head, but I can't stand you. Tell Frank to stand by five seconds, coming up. Will somebody get me a cup of coffee? Heads or tails? Heads. Tails. You lose. All right, but what's your point, Dr. Weston? Odds were 50/50 you'd win. And from your description of this Derek character, I'd say these are the same odds that's he's a clinical psychotic. On the other hand, there's this mental disorder known as Clerambault's syndrome, sometimes humorously referred to as "erotomania," where the victim is under the illusion that the love he gives to someone is returned. Now, this Derek is in love with Jamie and he probably thinks that she's just as much in love with him. She doesn't even know the man. That minor detail doesn't matter. He is in love with her. Come on. You see, you'd all be shocked if you knew just how many lonely people are out there with nothing in their lives but fantasies to keep them from despair. And what better target for their fantasies than a beautiful woman, like Jamie, who talks to them every night on television? See, love from a distance is safe. In fact, love is probably the noblest of all emotions and that gives him permission to do just about anything he wants to win her affection. What? Do you think he might hurt her? God forbid she should reject him. There's no telling what he'd do. Frankly, I think we've entered a new age of madness. That's why you have a pop psychologist like me. [laughs] Mass media shrink to solve mass mental illness. Just how dangerous could this guy get? I don't know. He probably seems like the average guy on the street, but who knows. Push the wrong button, he could kill her. And then, all of his friends would swear up and down that he was the kind of person who couldn't harm a flea. What can we do? Don't cross him. ♪ [music box] [shower] I think I'm gonna move in with Brandon. Just for a little while. I don't believe you, Jamie. You swore you'd never do that. You told me that would be the first step in letting a man control your life. Well, what the hell do you think this Derek character is doing right now? He's practically got me dancing in the palm of his hand. \h\h\h\h\h\h\hWell, then, \h\h\h\h\h\h\hget the control back. How? Don't let him drive you out of your house. If you let him do that, he won't stop until he gets everything of you that he wants. Robin, I'm scared of the man. Max? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hNo. Come on, Max. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hI said "no". Max, this guy is dangerous. You don't know that. Look, you have got to put someone on her. I'm tellin' ya. Brandon, I've had a real slice-o-life day and I'm tired, but if you don't let go... All right, you wanna make it hard for me, I'll make it hard for you. If you don't assign someone to her immediately, I'll write a front-page yellow sheet on your department that will wipe out every member of your force above the rank of trainee traffic cop. You probably can't even spell "trainee traffic cop." Max, I'm scared for her. Don't you think I'm just as concerned about Jamie as you are? Believe me, if there was something I could do, I would. But I can't. There's no way you can stop these kind of people. They're crawling all over the Goddamn place. Even if I put Lover Boy in jail, the minute he got out, he'd start all over again. Come on, Max, isn't there something I can do? \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hYes. What? Get a gun. You want me to kill him, don't you? I didn't say that. I'm a cop; I can't say that. I just said, "Get a gun." Take my advice, Jamie. Don't put up with this creep. Turn it around on him and you'll see. He'll hang dog tail and snake right out of your life as fast as he slid in. I'm not gonna become like him. That's very noble. And very stupid. He's not gonna disappear just because you want him to. You have to do something. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hLike what? What am I supposed to do? Take karate? Pack a gun? Become some kind of street thug? I can't do that. Even if I could, I wouldn't. I'm not a violent person. You might have to become one, darlin'. Come on. [sighs] ♪ [music box] [laughs] Oh, no.

Oh, I'm sorry to come by unannounced like this, but you left this at the studio and I thought you might need it. Oh, thank you. Oh, don't worry; I didn't look at it. I know how protective you are about your work. Insecure, Julie. What? Well, it's not that I'm protective about my work, it's that I'm insecure about it. I wanna make sure it's good before anybody sees it. Well, I--I appreciate you coming all the way up here. Well, that's not why I came. I came to talk to you. Well? Well, I came to tell you-- I wish I could just-- What? I must seem really silly just coming up here like this. Look, Julie, I think you're a very sweet girl. And, you know, sometimes I really wish things were different. What do you mean? Well, I hadn't planned on telling anybody yet, but I-- I'm engaged to be married. Pump... Point... [click] Pull the trigger. Brandon, I'm not gonna be reduced to a common vigilante. You might wanna change that policy unless you want this jerk to maybe kill you. Look, he may succeed in frightening me, but I'm not gonna be reduced to his level. I'm too strong for that. Strong don't mean jack shit when you're dealing with crazy. [phone ringing] I'll get it. No, I'll get it. I'm not gonna let him make me afraid to use my own phone. Hello? [Derek] That friend of yours is there, isn't he? That reporter? I know all about him, Jamie.

I'm Jamie's friend. [Brandon] You realize you've been reported to the police? I thought you're supposed to be a hot-shot reporter and have all the facts, but you don't know anything. You don't know me. You don't know where I live. You don't know anything about me. Listen, you wimpy little bastard, you leave Jamie alone, do you hear me? I love Jamie. I love Jamie... and she loves me. It's that simple. [dial tone] I'm gonna kill him. Brandon, look what he's doing to us. You're talking about murder.

And if Lover Boy ever so much as shows his face, I'm gonna blow his pecker off. Well, I hope your aim is real good, because you'd lose all your charm if he blew yours off instead. I'm talking about taking the law into my own hands and you sit there and give me a smartass remark? Brandon, don't get your Phi Beta Cappa gander up. I did you a big favor. Oh, yeah? What? Well, there's this ex-con. You see, I got him on a parole violation. I keep him out of jail and he keeps his eye on Jamie, maybe finds out about Lover Boy in the process. An ex-con? That's the best I could do. That's great. First I get stuck with some reject from the Don Juan school of romance, now you throw in an ex-con. Thanks, Max. Well, what do you want from me for Christ's sakes? Protection. Simple protection. Is that too much to ask for? Maybe I'm wrong, but I always thought that was your job, to serve and protect. To serve and protect? Well, here, I served you. And now I'll protect you. Go ahead, eat. [Max] Eat! [Brandon] I'm not hungry. You see, I'm a by-the-numbers cop. I do my job as best I can. I used to think that counted for something. Now I'm beginning to think it doesn't. Put that thing away, will ya? Law and order depends on people playing by the rules. But somewhere along the way, a bunch of people figure out they're not gonna play the game anymore, much less by the rules. And as a result, this country's in the grips of a crime wave unlike anything it's ever seen. Crime in the streets is the new national characteristic. And you know what? There's nothing to turn to. Not the courts or the law-makers. Not church, not punishment or rehabilitation or the jails or treatment. Not the politicians, not Daddy, not Mommy, not even God Almighty himself. And when everybody else has failed, society turns to one guy: the cop. They expect him to have all the answers. Well, I've run out of answers, Brandon. And what can I do about that harmless lover boy of yours when I can't do anything about the rapists, the thieves, your everyday mass murderers? Now why don't you just leave me alone? I just wanna eat my eggs like everybody else. Okay. This is Jamie Douglas at the Baldwin Hills Cemetery, where this morning the body of another young woman was found by two caretakers. At this point in the police investigation, homicide detectives are speculating that this is yet another in a series of the so-called "Sweetheart Murders". As in the first six cases, the victim was found-- This is terrific stuff, Jamie. Ought to have 'em squirming in their seats. How can you say that? I think it's horrible. Yeah. But it's great for the ratings. Look at these people. [laughs] They look like extras from Night of the Living Dead. Bobby. At this stage in police investigation, homicide detectives are speculating that this is the last in a series of murders, which has come to be known as the calling card of the Sweetheart Killer-- Wait a minute. Stop. Go back. Right there. Stop. Now, go forward. Sweetheart Killer. \h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hStop. Can you slow-mo it back? What is it, Jamie? Right there. That's Derek. What's he trying to do? Maybe he's the Sweetheart Killer. Jamie. Jamie, I didn't mean that. Listen, it was a stupid thing for me to say. I'm sorry.

Arson investigators are looking into the cause of a fire that destroyed a manufacturing company in east Los Angles today. The fire broke out around 3 a.m. this morning.
