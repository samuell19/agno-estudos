A Shochiku Film Kimi no Na wa Part 2 (Always in My Heart Part 2) Cast KEIJI SADA KEIKO KISHI CHIKAGE AWASHIMA YUMEJI TSUKIOKA YUJI KAWAKITA TOSHIKO KOBAYASHI HITOMI NOZOE KEIKO AWAJI Director: Hideo Oba I, too, understand how precious life is for the first time in my life. Thanks to you. No, I'm alive thanks to you. I'll never forget this night. Where do you live? Yotsuya. Then maybe that air raid last night... Yes... Then you must hurry home. Go. Quickly now. - Thank you so much. - Not at all. Oh... I don't know how long this war will last, but if we both survive I'd like to see you again to remember this feeling. If in six months we're still alive, let's plan to meet here on the night of November 24th. Yes, lets... If we're still alive. On November 24th, then. Eight o'clock at night. Yes, I will definitely come. Great. Hey. Most importantly... What is your name? I'm... Another air raid! Go quickly now. I'll be here, six months from now. Let's not tell each other our names until then. Good bye. Six months later... A year later... Machiko did not come. Then... On November 24th 18 months later... It was a foggy night. You came. It's been a long time... So you were safe. You, too. I... I waited for you for a long time. Now we've finally met. I came last year, and this May and waited. I kept waiting for a girl I only met for a single night while running from the air raid. I may be stupid but I kept waiting. I staked my whole life on that night's promise. Haruki, I wanted to see you, too. And now I know that you were waiting for me feeling the same way. Were you in Tokyo all this time? Tell me everything tonight. Haruki, I'm getting married tomorrow. I see. You're getting married. Haruki, I didn't intend to see you again. But before I got married, I wanted to see this bridge full of memories one last time. Thank you. I'm glad you came. I hope you'll be very happy. Haruki, perhaps you're already married? Goodbye, then. Machiko got married. But her marriage was not a happy one. Her husband Katsunori, who was transferred to Tokyo Headquarters, met Haruki Atomiya who worked there, too. Katsunori was jealous. Machiko was tormented by her husband's jealousy and mother-in-law's hatred. On a rainy night, Machiko left Katsunori and returned to Sado. Fate reunited them on the cliffs above the sea. Haruki. What am I to do? Machiko. You... Perhaps you should go back... to Hamaguchi. For the sake of the baby. We have to forget each other. Haruki. Machiko. You have to go home. Alright? Oblivion is to forget completely. The heartache of promising oblivion when one cannot forget. Sorry to keep you waiting. You bought a lot of things. It's Uncle Kaseda's celebration. I'm so glad they released him early. Is it true you're going to Hokkaido? Yes, my friend invited me. - Why? - You know why. He's lonely. Isn't that right? I met you on this bridge and many things happened since then. So take a good look. There's no Sukiya Bridge in Hokkaido. Hi, kid. Is Uncle back? Mr. Nishina. Sorry I'm late. We were waiting for you. This way. Good boy. Uncle, Mr. Nishina is here. Great. Please come in. I just got home. Everyone's celebrating my return. I see. Congratulations. Welcome. I should have gone to greet you but I had urgent business. Please. Mr. Nishina, this is Haruki Atomiya. Hello, I've heard a lot about you. I'm Nishina. Nice to meet you. I'm Atomiya. Same here. He's my army buddy and is now an executive for a produce company. He sent me things in prison, too. I see. Thank you. Not at all. Please, Mr. Nishina. Thank you. Here's to your health. Thank you. I don't want to rush, but it's about the fruits store I mentioned before. We found a suitable store. It's in Ningyo-cho and with a little fix-up, it's ready to go. I see. I appreciate that. Mr. Nishina suggested we run a fruits store together. Oh, is that so? Since I work for a produce company, that's the only thing I could come up with And I think I can be of some help. It's too good an offer for the likes of me. But I'd like to give it a try. What do you think, Kozue? If you want to, I'm all for it. But we've had bad experiences with kind men. Don't say that. Asa? Were you referring to me? I know I haven't been able to help you in any way. Although I talk a lot, I was too concerned with myself. I'm very sorry. But better days are just around the corner for you. You'll do your best, wont you? Mr. Kaseda, I'm counting on you, too. I can go to Hokkaido now with no worries. Mr. Atomiya, remember what we talked about? About the good will of people? - Yes. - You were right. At one point I stopped believing it. And I stooped to smuggling. But when I see you all, I've a renewed trust in people's virtue. So please don't worry. I'll do my best. Yes, I will. Oh, Atomiya. Hi, Aya. I'm glad I didn't miss you. Why didn't you tell me you were going? I'm sorry. I wanted to leave quietly. I haven't begun to thank you. Sorry I couldn't help. Machiko's leaving for Sado tomorrow. Do you want me to give her a message? Aya. We promised we won't talk about her. I guess so. We're all going to be in different places. You take care of yourself You, too. I'm so sad... Doesn't this look like lovers parting? Oh, this letter came to you from Toba. All right, then. Good bye. Take care. I have to apologize to you again about your sister. Yukie left Wagu without telling anyone. Has she contacted you? I'm worried but I'm in the hospital right now so there's nothing I can do. I've made Yukie unhappy again because I'm weak. I am also responsible for Nami's death. It happened several days ago. Nami, what are you doing here? Where were you? Did you go to see Yukie again? No, I was working late. - Let's go home. - Liar! You've always regretted marrying me. Isn't that so? You're always thinking of how to get rid of me. Nami... It was wrong for us from the start. Let's go home. We'll talk here. Dear? Nami! Nami, don't do this. Nami. Nami... Nami. We were cursed. She's been acting strangely lately. I suppose it was only natural to come to this since we married because we had sex. Kengo. I'm responsible, too. I kept saying I couldn't forgive you, but I wanted to forgive you. I made my unhappiness too obvious. I cast a dark shadow on you and Nami. I should have left a long time ago. I know how Nami was suffering. Kengo. I won't see you again. That's the least I can do to atone to Nami. And with that, Yukie left Wagu. Perhaps she's gone to Tokyo. I pray that she is safe. Hamaguchi I'm afraid she's not here. She left for Izu yesterday with her husband to visit a sick executive. Oh, how nice for them. They left an old woman to mind the house. Young people these days are so inconsiderate. But since Machiko has finally come home... It's not as though I asked her to return. She came back on her own. So... I hadn't seen her for a while since I saw her in Sado, so... I see. Thank you for coming. You were there with a Mr. Atomiya, I understand. I see. Could you give this to Machiko? It's a good luck charm for a safe birth. You may not believe in it, but it's the thought that counts. Thank you again. Excuse me for asking... but did someone ask you to do this? No... I see. Then I guess it's all right. I'll be going then. - Sorry to have bothered you. - Not at all. Is it true that Mr. Atomiya is now in Hokkaido? Yes. I know everything. Look, you... You're worse than I thought. I'm shocked. Kasuga How is Hokkaido, Atomiya? What do you do every day? I miss you now that you're not around. I went to see Machiko, but she had gone to a hot spring. I met the hateful mother-in-law. Sorry, you went to Hokkaido to forget. I'll stop meddling and start thinking of myself. Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend. Someone great like Atomiya. Welcome. Welcome. Hey, wait. You can't put her in the private room. Can't you tell what she is? Be more careful. You. Come with me. I'm not going to report you to the police, so don't look so scared. Sit here. You came once before. I know why you come here. You pretend to be a customer, but you're looking for a john. Don't use this place for that. I don't want rumors to spread that high-class prostitutes frequent this place. It's not much of a place, but we're very strict about things like that. Here's for ruining your business tonight. Take it. Come on, take it. You used to be a housewife. Are you a war widow? It's not that. I'm unsympathetic. I'm human after all. People have to do anything to survive. But you have to be strong. You can choose to a different life. It was just when I arrived in Tokyo. Lady. Are you looking for work? You're a war widow, right? I saw you at the employment agency. I can find you a great job. It's perfect for a war widow. You don't have to act proud. You can wear nice clothes... Eat great things... Know what I mean? Hey, wait. I'm trying to be nice. Go away or I'll call the police. Police? Sure, take me there. Come. I said come. Hey, you. What are you doing? That's no way to treat a lady. Who the hell are you? What do you intend to do with this lady? It's none of your business. I have lots of guys who'll come if I call. - You okay with that? - So what? You go now. Don't worry. - What's going on, Nozoe? - Oh, Professor. This man was bothering the lady. You'll regret this. Foolish man. Thank you so much. There are bad people in this world. Be careful. Let's go, Nozoe. Are you from the provinces? Yes, I was looking for a job, and that man... He's not that tough. You must find a respectable place. But it must be tough, living in a inn and looking for a job. The hotels must be expensive and there's always men like him. Professor? How about Hakka Hasteâ€œ!? Well, let's see. There's a hostel that is run by students who work part time. It'll be easier to find a job there. But will they take me in? An introduction from Professor will do the trick. Why don't we have him give you his card? Here we are. This way. So they were in cahoots. Yes. There are bad people in this world. We're planning to leave tomorrow. Why don't you stay longer? It's your second honeymoon. You only live once. Enjoy yourself while you can. It's the end if you need to come for the cure. Being here with you, the past seems like a bad dream. Bureau chief said this was a second honeymoon and he may be right. Tomorrow you'll come back home and live with Mother again. You're prepared to do that? Yes. I shall. I'll do anything for my child. That's why I came back. I see. Machiko, I wasn't a good husband to you. The only way I could express my love for you was through jealousy. I'll be more mature from now on. But you have to forget Atomiya. All right? Yes. For the sake of the child, we have to be on good terms. And we have to repair the gulf between us. Machiko, I don't want you to get cold. Let's go back to our room. What's the matter? You're still not well. Dear, we will be happy won't we? That all depends on you. Machiko, let's be happy. Let's try, Machiko. Machiko. What's wrong? Sorry, you went to Hokkaido to forget. I'll stop meddling and start thinking of myself. Hey, what's the matter? You must be missing Tokyo around now. I was thinking I want to stay here forever. Were you? Then settle down here. I can always use another hand. I have this many cows and horses. Haruki. Want to come? I'm going to Akan. You sure I can come? Is it okay, Suenaga? Sure. Atomiya, go with her. Go to the forest and get rid of your old dream. "The snow of faraway mountains" "is a white flower." "Red flowers are in bloom in my village." "Spring is here again." Yumi, you're a good singer. All Ainu are good singers. Haruki, have you forgotten the mainland woman? Suenaga told me... why you came all the way up here. Haruki, forget the woman. I'll make you forget. "The black lily is a flower of love." "If you give it to the one you love," "They will eventually become lovers." "Shall I give this flower to the gentleman?" "Because I really love that gentleman." Oh, Mother. You're awake. How are you feeling? I was meaning to come sooner, but I'm busy because I have to manage all alone. I'm so sorry. Machiko, I heard you had a miscarriage. You must feel better... in more ways than one. But to kill an unborn child from carelessness... Although you may have intended to all along... How could you let it die before it came into this world. Oh, Machiko, Aya came to see you. She brought a safe-birth charm. That man Atomiya probably asked her. You should have given birth for his sake, too. Atomiya must be very disappointed. What do you mean? That's what I'd like to ask you. Mother, that's so cruel. Machiko, let's not fight anymore. - We're not fighting. - It's fine now. You took responsibility for what you did. Don't get excited or you won't get well. Rest. Once you're well, we'll talk. - Leaving already? - I have to go back to the inn. What's the matter? Does it hurt? No. Nurse, I'd like to send a telegram. It's to my aunt in Sado. Urgent. Please come ASAP. - Welcome. - Hello. Oh, we met at Mr. Atomiya's... So this is it. Atomiya told me you had a fruits store. It's a nice store. How's business? - It's going well. - Oh, good. Could you give me ten of those apples? Thank you. Don't go far. Welcome. Does she work here, too? Yes. Anything wrong? Do you remember me? I met you near Sukiya Bridge. Oh, yes. You know her, Kozue? Yes, I said unkind things to her then. I'm so sorry. I apologize. I should think before I talk. I've forgotten. Good. So you know Atomiya, too? Yes, very well. Since he went to Hokkaido we miss him. Me, too. I got a letter from him yesterday. Oh, good. And he's well? - Yes, it seems so. - Is that right? Please come in. What a coincidence. That we all know Atomiya. Speaking of coincidences, Atomiya's sister is staying with me. You mean the sister from Toba? That's right. I think I'll come in. So I'm trying to find work for her. I'm about to see someone right now. I see. So she is an unfortunate person. That's right. So would you keep your ears open? Kozue, why don't we ask her to help us here? I suppose... Why don't we talk to Uncle Kaseda? Sure. It's Atomiya's sister after all. Machiko, you aunt is here. Machiko. Aunt. Machiko, what happened? How awful for you. I don't know who contacted you, but thanks for coming all the way from Sado. She's fine now. She's going home today. The miscarriage happened after they had fun at the hot springs. That was careless of her. Did you apologize to Katsunori and his mother? Machiko, since you're so sincere, you must have apologized, but apologize to her again in front of me, please. It's not necessary. Machiko hasn't spoken to me for a while. She hates me. I was hoping to have a talk with you. It's good to be young. You can get away with anything if you cry. Ma'am, I'll talk to Machiko and have her mend her ways. I know you're angry but please forgive her. All right. She may not be able to speak freely if I'm here, so I'll go back to the inn. Katsunori will be here tonight, so we can all talk then. Machiko, I guessed as much when I got your telegraph. Aunt... I can't. I can't stand this anymore. Look, Katsunori. If you really love her, could you live apart from your mother? Live apart? You're throwing me out? I gave birth to him and raised him until now. How dare you say that to me! Katsunori is a dutiful son. Would you please stay out of this? I'm asking Katsunori. Katsunori, you have an important job, but when your own wife is being accused unjustly you can't do a thing? I'm amazed you can do your job property. You're a good-for-nothing. You should be the one person who takes his wife's side. But you side with your perverse jealous mother. You may say you're being dutiful to your mother. However, if the mother is irrational, it's your duty to make her see reason. What makes you think I'm unreasonable? Be careful what you say. That's my line. To accuse your daughter-in-law of adultery... I'm not cultured like you, just a fisherman's wife from Sado. So maybe I don't talk the right way. But I know right from wrong. So, Katsunori, which is it? Are you going to live apart or not? Well, Katsunori? What are you going to do? I see. Then it can't be helped. What will you do, Machiko? The only way is divorce. Machiko, why can't you be more patient? You said you'd endure anything. It's natural for a daughter-in-law to obey her mother-in-law in any house. You're selfish. Katsunori, do you think your mother is rational? I'm irrational? And you're reasonable? Katsunori, haven't you had enough? If she wants to leave, let her go. Machiko. Let's discuss this calmly. Just the two of us. If we do, we'll find a solution. Why don't we take a walk? Settle it so there's no future trouble. Machiko, come back soon. You're fortunate to have a devoted son. Yes, thank you very much. You, too, have a fine niece. She runs away, then comes back... When she has a miscarriage, she wants a divorce... I've never seen anyone so self-centered. If Katsunori agrees, I would like her to leave this very minute. Then tell Katsunori that. It's a miracle Machiko endured for so long. So you came back just for the child. Not for me. You probably thought a lot about this... Are you sure you won't change your mind? I'm sorry for you. But I can't do this anymore. I said I would try if we lived apart from your mother. But even if we did, we've hurt each other too much. Isn't that because you won't try to understand me? That may be true. But now, I don't have the energy o even try. Machiko. You've become a cold-hearted woman. I went through a lot. Are you blaming me? Machiko. What will you do if I won't give you a divorce? What would you have me do? Look, why don't you let me go back to Sado for now? I want to think in peace. If you must go, I'll allow it. But even if we are apart, I won't let you go. As I said before, I don't want to lose to anyone concerning you. I don't want to lose to you either. Don't forget that. Haruki! What is it, Yumi? I came to get you because you're late. Get down. Let's play. I want to tell you something. So let's go. I want to take you someplace special. This is Lake Mashu. For us Ainu, it's Kamui's lake, the god's lake. The men and women of our village say our vows here. If we break it, the gods will punish us. But that's probably superstition. Haruki, it's a superstition, isn't it? I don't know. But it's a beautiful custom. Once a person makes a pledge, he should try to keep it. Lake Mashu. No wonder they call it the enchanted lake. It's beautiful. Haruki. Haruki, don't you like me? Well? - I don't dislike you. - Then you like me? I like you. Haruki. I want to make a vow with you here. Please, can I? Haruki! Haruki! Don't, Yumi. Haruki, I made a pledge to the gods of the lake. I said my vows. Yumi! Haruki! Let's go home. Hey, Atomiya. Yumi's telling everyone you're going to marry her. Is that true? Not really. She asked me if I liked or disliked her. So I told her I liked her. So that's it. Up here, there's no figure of speech. Like is like. But think about it... It won't be bad to marry her and immigrate to Hokkaido. Why don't you decide your future here and now? It's not good to fixate on your past. It'll be a good way to forget Machiko. What a beautiful voice. Guys. Hurry up and finish and go to bed. I saw you. What were you doing at Lake Mashu today? Yumi, don't you like me anymore? What about our vows at Lake Mashu? That was then. I like Haruki better than you now. I'm going to marry Haruki. So go. I said go. If you don't, I'm going to call for help. Go. I hate you, Sabu. I really hate you. Yumi. Aren't you afraid of the god's punishment? Yumi, aren't you afraid? Yumi. You made a foolish marriage. Machiko, you might never be happy unless you marry Atomiya. I wonder how he's doing. I wonder, too... I'll deliver the rest once they come in. Thank you. How's your new job? It's great, thanks. You really work hard. Excuse me. Oh, Yukie. Yukie, did Mr. Kaseda speak to you? No. Never mind then. Please tell him I'll come by soon. Excuse me. Mr. Nishina is a good person. Yes, really. He's so kind. But he's especially nice to you. He probably likes you. - I don't think so. - I bet he does. Because he's a bit too attentive. See, he's still looking this way. Nishina lost his wife in the war. He's been raising his child on his own. When he met you, he thought you could be a mother to his child. He came to me four days ago and I've been thinking... Nishina has gone through a lot, so I thought it was fine to make the introduction. But a woman like me... Even if people are down and out, if they really want to, they can start over. All of us here did it. I want all of you to find happiness. That's right. If you find happiness, we can, too. I have that kind of... Hope, you mean. That's right, we can hope. Hope, huh. You see, Yukie, both Kozue and Asa think that happy or unhappy, what happens to you will happen to them, too. So please think about it. What are you thinking about? It's a strange world. Remember I told you about the sad love story on Sukiya Bridge? I got letters from both of them. The woman is in Sado, the guy in Hokkaido. And their letters came together. The woman wants to divorce her husband but the guy may marry another woman. And she's an Ainu girl, native to Hokkaido. Why are they so out of synch? Their stars won't align. I guess. It's too bad. I've had enough. I can't keep trying to get them together. Aya, don't be mad about others and find one of your own. I'm not mad... Oh look, this is strange. When I tossed the letters they landed apart but now they've come together. Maybe someday they will be together. That's just a coincidence. Aya, you have a guest. Oh, Yukie. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch. How are things? Are you well? Yes, thanks to you. That's good. I've been meaning to visit you. I need your advice. What is it? Come on in. I see. It sounds like a good match. So you're going to have a marriage meeting in Itako? But should I accept without telling him of my past? That's not a problem. Get married without telling him. What's there to gain by you owning up? You'll just disappoint him. Look, Yukie. Everyone is entitled to get married. Isn't that so? Mr. Kaseda? She has no children? That's what I understand. But that doesn't mean she can't be a good mother. Of course, she would be perfect. Mr. Nishina, I'll vouch for her. She's a good person. But if she had a dark past, what would you do? Is there something in her past? No, I think she's led an upstanding life. But the few years after the war ended, there are things we all did that we wish wouldn't come to light. Because I did what I did, it sounds like an excuse. Same goes for me. Perhaps not asking about our past is the etiquette these days. Etiquette? I agree. Hey, you. Long time. Where are you going? You look like you're in the money. Looks like you made a good catch. What does that mean? What do you think? There's a lot I want to say. Let's go. - Excuse me. - Hey. Is she asleep? - Yes. - Thank you. Yukie, come over here and relax. - Sorry to have troubled you. - Not at all. So do you think you want to be her mother? - Yes. - That's good. - Right, Mr. Nishina? - Thanks to you. Asa, you, too. Mr. Nishina, I'm so glad. - Congratulations. - Thank you. I'm so glad. This is auspicious. Please have one, too. Is one of you Miss Yukie? A Mr. Yokoyama is waiting downstairs. Yokoyama? Isn't that the man on the boat? I don't know. I'll go see what he wants. If that's the man, I know him well. I'll go see him. Yukie, you and Mr. Nishina have a decision to make. So talk it over well. Why do you want to see her? I bet you're up to no good. You're right, of course. Yokoyama, this is an important time for her. She's on the verge of finding happiness. Don't mess things up. I'm surprised your Excellency is acquainted with her. You know, don't you? I don't know what story she's putting about, - but she used to be my... - What of it? Oh, nothing much. But we invested money in that woman. What? Hey, Yokoyama! You're throwing your weight around. Let's be friends. It's nice to see you doing well. I read about your smuggling in Okinawa. You always did things in a big way. Not like us, chasing around a woman or two... Shut up! Shut up? Are you kidding? You're still on parole. Hey, Yokoyama. Why do you only think about making people unhappy. I still have affections for that woman. Forget it. I won't get anywhere talking to you. I'll talk to her directly. Hey. Yokoyama, stop. - What? - Damn you. How dare you strike me! We're not at war anymore. Old man. Do you think you can get the better of me? You're not young any more. Oh, wait, wail. Hey. Yokoyama. Yokoyama? Uncle. Uncle Kaseda. Uncle? What happened? What did the police say? They know the victim is an unsavory character. But Mr. Kaseda won't say what happened. Then they won't release him? The victim is hospitalized in serious condition, so it may take a couple of days. Uncle Kaseda was still on parole. I should... I should go to the police and talk to them. This all happened because of me. Yukie. Are you telling me that you know why those two were arguing? Mr. Nishina. I'll... I'll tell you everything. I was. Yukie. Don't. You can talk to the police to save Mr. Kaseda. But don't tell me about it. To tell you the truth, I knew I've known for some time. It's only natural I'd be careful about any prospective wife. I did some checking. At first, I was shocked. But when I saw how hard you were working, I could tell which one of you... the past or the present, was the real you. No matter what's in your past, all that matters is that now, you're leading an honest life. Right, Yukie? You will marry me? Please make my daughter happy. Please. Then, let's go to the police together. And you tell them what you know. If they know the reason, they will release him. Mr. Nishina... Shall we go? About the same time... Sado What fine weather we're having. It will be cold soon. Machiko, I see you got a letter. Is it from Katsunori? - No. - Then who? It was from Aya. Aya? What did she say? Aunt. Mr. Atomiya. What about Mr. Atomiya? Oh my. Mr. Atomiya's getting married in Hokkaido? Is it true? But what's Katsunori thinking? He hasn't said anything. He should make his intentions clear whether he will grant you a divorce or not. Does he still think you're coming back? We have to settle this before winter. Agreed, Machiko? Nobue. Hey, Nobue. The bossy man is home. Nobue, didn't you hear me? I heard you. Then why didn't you answer? Idiot! You kept me waiting. - Good for nothing. - What? I'm talking about Katsunori. Section Chief Room. Reception Room Machiko. It's been a long time. When did you come to Tokyo? I just arrived. I shouldn't have bothered you at work... So you've come home? I have a favor to ask you. What is it? It's about the divorce. I want it now. Why? Did you come all the way to tell me that? You must know what my answer is. We should talk about that at home. I can't talk about that at the office. I'm in a meeting right now. Go home and wait for me there. Your room is just the way it was. Let's talk about this tonight. Okay, Machiko? You car will be here momentarily. It was a grand affair. Congratulations. I hope you both will be very happy. Thank you. Uncle, there's more sake. Yukie, Brother Atomiya is here. What? Mr. Atomiya. It's been a while. Same here. I'm so glad you came. I should have come sooner. Sister, congratulations. Thank you. I owe it all to them. I see. Thank you all. Mr. Nishina. Please take care of my sister. I will. Mr. Atomiya, please sit. Let's celebrate. Have a glass. You haven't change. Is it true you're getting married in Hokkaido? Say it's not true. Come back to Tokyo and live with us. Asa, don't interfere. Look, Sukiya Bridge. I kept waiting. I staked my whole life on that night's promise. Haruki, I wanted to see you, too. Now I know you were waiting for me feeling the same way. I want to know everything. Haruki. I'm getting married tomorrow. Was that the last train today? When is he coming back? Are you going back to the ranch? Can you take a passenger? - She has business there. - Sure thing. She'll take you. It was good timing. - Get in the back. - Thank you. Why are you going to the ranch? I understand a Mr. Atomiya is there. Haruki? What do you want with Haruki? I want to see him and talk to him. What's your name? Is it Machiko? I'm right, aren't I? Yes. Haruki's not here. He's in Tokyo. When he comes back, I'm going to marry him. Scared? Haruki wouldn't be scared. Welcome. I hear you were on a business trip. - I just came back today. - You must be tired. Hamaguchi, I'm here tonight because of your wife. Machiko? I hear you're still separated. I didn't know. She's a self-centered woman. She comes and goes as she pleases. I don't know what to do. I hear she showed up at the office. Who knows where she's got to now. Chief, why do you want to talk about Machiko? Well... I met her. At Hakodate Station on my way back from Sapporo. Hakodate? So Machiko is in Hokkaido? Chief, are you sure? Yes, I met her. What a woman! Chief, did you know that in Hokkaido... We didn't have a lot of time. But she told me the gist. I don't want to interfere in matters between a husband and wife. But she sounded very unhappy. She was crying. I don't know what she told you, but that woman always cries for effect. I see. I have a soft spot for young woman so I sympathized with her. It wouldn't do to just hear one side of the story. I'm sure you have your say, too. But she asked me to help. To think she'd bother you with that. I'm ashamed she aired our dirty laundry in public. Katsunori? It's your fault. Because you're indecisive. You should divorce her. You must know why she went to Hokkaido. She went to be with that man. What an awful woman. Chief. I am Machiko's husband. I will handle Machiko. Sakakibara Law Offices Yumi. Yumi. - Yumi. - Yumi. Let me take you home. I said no, Ma. I won't leave. But the festival's tonight. - Let's go. - No! Yumi, don't be stubborn. Your ma and Sabu came to fetch you. So go with them. I don't care about any festival. I'm going to wait for Haruki here. Are you serious, Yumi? What about Saburo? I don't care about Saburo. I'm waiting for Haruki. Atomiya won't be back for some time. When he comes back, you can see him right away. It's a holiday after all. Go home. No! Haruki will come back tomorrow. I won't budge until Haruki comes back. Yumi! Why are you being so stubborn? I'm going to get angry. Go home! Boss. You want me to leave because that woman came from Tokyo. I won't leave. If I do, she'll take Haruki from me. If I can't have Haruki, I'll die. Yumi, don't be so unreasonable. Yumi, let's go. Please, let's go. No! Stop making this difficult. Go home. - No! - Go! You stubborn girl. Don't make me force you. Understand, Yumi? Understand? You must be surprised. As you can see, Hokkaido is a wild uninhibited place. I shouldn't have come. Yes, for Yumi's sake. But for Atomiya...? I'm not so sure. He'll be back tomorrow. Good evening. I haven't see you in a while, Constable. It's getting cold. It'll be snowing soon. - I'll make some tea. - This is fine. What is it? Nothing serious. A cow from the next ranch has gone missing. I'm looking for it. I see. It probably went to see the festival. Please come in. You have a guest. She's from the mainland. She's beautiful. Oh, is this her? Machiko Hamaguchi? Yes. What of it? It's nothing. There's an inquiry from Tokyo about her. It's fine if you're here. It's nothing important. I guess I'll continue to chase the cow. Sorry to have bothered you. It's going to get cold. Yumi, you insist on going to the station? Then you refuse to marry Saburo? Lake Mashu is God's lake. Are you prepared to break your vow? Lying to me or to Saburo, that can't be helped. But if you lie to God's lake, something awful will happen. Lake Mashu is the guardian deity of the Ainu people. Aren't you afraid of God's wrath? I'm not afraid. Not at all. Haruki said he'll marry me. I love Haruki more than God. Yumi, don't you know? That woman from the mainland... Boss Suenaga told me about her. That woman is Atomiya's beloved. That's right. Boss Suenaga told me, too. Now that she's here, Atomiya won't give you a second glance. Yumi, you're a woman of this village. Keep your promise to God. Marry Saburo. That's where your happiness lies. Our happiness lies with each other. That is our fate. Please try to understand. No. I'm not going to lose out to that woman. I won't lose. So don't stop me. Yumi! Yumi. Saburo. I have a feeling something horrible will happen. Haruki! - Yumi, you came. - You're late. - I was here every day. - Is that so? Let's go. Atomiya. She's been waiting for you. Machiko. Why are you here? I wanted to see you. You can talk later. Let's go. Shall we go? - Let's go. - Yes. Haruki. I brought you a present. You won't come with me? I have a guest today. Yumi, take this and go home alone. Yumi. See? Machiko. I came here to forget you. I intended to die here, and tried to love that girl, Yumi. I was on the verge of losing you forever. Machiko. I'm glad you came. I couldn't help myself. I had no idea what would happen, but before I knew it, I was here. But now that I've met you, I'm really glad I came. This is the northernmost place in Japan. Is this the only place for us? Haruki... Saburo. Saburo. I was wrong. I was wrong to break my vows to you and the gods. Yumi, let's go home. Forget the man from the mainland. This is God's punishment. I can't go back to the village. I'm in love with Haruki. Saburo. I'm sorry. Yumi! Yumi... Saburo... Well? We didn't find them. Once you go under, you never come up again. Atomiya, you must be tired. I'll draw a bath for you. It's my fault. I shouldn't have come. I caused this to happen. Machiko. You're not to blame. The fault is all mine. I led that girl on. Atomiya, a word? This came for Machiko. It's a court summons. Machiko. It's an order for restitution of conjugal rights. He's determined not to divorce you. Machiko. You must return to Tokyo. It's a court order. After I do what I have to for Yumi, I'll come back to Tokyo. We'll figure out what to do then. It's hard for me to say this to you. You've come such a long way for me. But, Machiko, we should do the right thing. No matter how long we may suffer, if we keep our hearts pure, someday we'll be together. Let's wait for that day. Will you, Machiko? Yes. Oh... It's snowing. No matter what happens, don't despair. I won't. But I never expected to part again in misery. Haruki. I don't want to go. I don't want to let you go. Haruki... I'm going. Machiko. Haruki. We'll meet again? I have a feeling I'll never see you again. Machiko. Let's be strong. Yes. Take care. You, too. And thus, Machiko and Haruki, parted in sadness once again. When will they finally be together?
