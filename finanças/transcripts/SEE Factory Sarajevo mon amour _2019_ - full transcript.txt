Why did I wait for you so long? My luggage came first, believe me. Your father fell in love. What? Your father fell in love with another woman. What a beautiful day! I was thinking of taking some flying lessons. I am fed up with the traffic in this town. I have all the predispositions, good motor skills, intellectual abilities and talent. - Are you hungry? - No. Where are we going? Whose house is this? You'll see. I fix my hair. Where we are going? Come with me. Let's go. At least tell me who is it! Don't be scared. I am here because my husband cheated on me. - Why do you say that? - She has to know. It will be better. I already feel better. I really do feel better. Do I look better? Will it last long? You'll be better God willing. Don't worry about it. Your hair is beautiful. I am not sure I should cut mine - Or let it grow. - Don't cut it. Why? Do you have a hair band? - Mommy's little... - Don't. Please, stop it. I missed you so much. A lot. I am really feeling better. Believe me. Before coming here, I was a little... I really feel a lot better. Your heart is not lost, don't worry. Go and look out as far as you can to feel all the benefits. - Are we going? - Yes, I just need to pay. Thank you very much. I feel much better. Really. Like everything has... disappeared. You will be better. Here you go. Let's go, mom. - Mom. - Just a second. - My head is tingling. - It can happen. My head is tingling. I can't see you clearly. My head is tingling... Let's go out, you'll feel better. Wait a second. What is going on? I can't see you properly. Let's go out. You'll feel better. What did you do to me? I was better when I arrived. Suddenly, I don't feel good. It went to my head! All of a sudden, I am cold. Let's go for lunch. - What have you done to me? - Let's go. Mom, please. Turn me back to how I was before. I don't feel good, my head tingles. My mouth is dry and I don't see very well. I don't feel good. Just turn me back to... Get out! Don't feel bad, she'll get better. Here you go. She is a little bit... She'll be fine. She is a little bit nervous. She just needs to sleep and she will be okay, trust me. Goodbye. What are you doing? - I am looking for my fucking keys! - Where are they? I don't know. I put them in the bag. Where the fuck are they? Where did I put them? In your hand, mom. Let's go have lunch. Let's go. Hello. Anja was right. Thank you for coming. - I am Damir, nice to meet you. - Elma. As you know. Anja gave me this for you. Don't stand there. What will people think? Go ahead, start eating. Don't be shy. You haven't eaten yet, have you? Did you prepare all this for me? Sit down and eat. It's bad luck if you don't eat anything. Why such a hurry? I have a concert. Here it is. I always carry it with me. Really? Sorry, I can't make it. Please, play something for me. Now? Alright, fine. A short one. I don't want to get beaten up by your neighbors. Wait a second. I told you it was loud. Thank you. One second, I need to check on the baby. Baby? I didn't know. Why didn't you tell me? She would sleep even with a whole brass band playing. Come. I don't know how she'll learn the colors it's all blue or pink, here. What's her name? Alisa. She's a year and a half. It was difficult in the beginning. I didn't have anyone to help me. I don't have anyone. No siblings. My parents were killed... When you have a baby, you feel insecure. Sometimes, I have a feeling I'm surrounded by murderers. Do you want coffee? I'm sure you do. Good luck! He's a keeper. Anja. I'll put some music on. Sure. John Coltrane! Yes. A friend introduced me to it. I like it a lot. He is my favorite musician. There's a church in San Francisco that is devoted to him. He is a saint there. They use his music and lyrics as a liturgy. We should all convert to music as a religion. What about the girl's father? Immature, as usual. Fear of commitment, love, normal life. What about you? Do you have someone somewhere in this vast world? No. I just broke up with a woman. A French woman. I'm learning French, you know. Really? One black coffee and a coffee with cream, please. Where have you been? One black coffee, and a coffee with cream. And chocolates from Anja. Thank you very much. Is this copy of "Raspberry Jam" yours? I must have read it a hundred times. I lent it to Anja last summer. She made me read it. She told me I'd like it, she was right. When you read it, you fall in love with Sarajevo. Maybe that's why I felt like coming back. It worked out for you. I stayed here thinking it'd be easier among my own people. You hope for the best but nothing ever changes. How long are you staying? Until tomorrow. I only came for the concert. That's terrible. It means we won't see you again. We would have come tonight, but they won't let Alisa in the club. My love. Come here. What have you brought? She is so cute. - Did we wake her? - No. Kitty. This might be a weird question, but would you mind if we came to Paris with you? You and Alisa? Are you back, my boy? Yes, mom. - Is everything ready? - I'm almost done with the ironing. - You made your cookies. - Yes. Just got them out of the oven. They are so tasty, amazing! I'm sure she will like them. She'll love you straight away. Don't worry about me, dear, as long as she's the right girl for you. She definitely is. You'll see for yourself. Here are your pants and your shirt. And the blazer? It still smells of smoke. I left it out on the balcony. Fine, but I look better with it. You are gorgeous anyway, my dear. Just like your dad when he was young. How was your day? It went well. I wrote 17 fines, today. God bless you, my boy. 56 more, and I will get the bonus my boss promised! God's will! What is the name of the girl, again? Iva. Ivanka? No. Just Iva. Remember it, please. You look sexy. You're not so bad yourself. Welcome to our home. Come in, come in. You can leave your shoes on. Sure? I'm sure. I didn't have time to clean the floor, anyway. Please sit down. I am very glad you are here. It's very nice to meet you. I heard a lot of nice things about you. Well, don't believe everything he says. He is a policeman, after all! I made coffee and cakes. I am sorry but I can't have coffee. No coffee? Why? I already had three cups since morning. I could have a tea. Iva is a journalist for Balkan Internacional. International! Yes, I cover cultural events. Anyway, they say too much coffee is not good for your health, right? I have some chamomile tea, is that Ok? Yes, thank you. I missed you. I didn't miss you at all. No? Stop it. My mother is here! So what? What, so what? Here you go. It smells delicious. Did you make them yourself? Of course, honey. It's not that difficult. One day, I will show you. You would need to. I've never learned how to cook. I never have time. Every night there is a play, a movie, so many events I need to write about. God bless you and your work. It must be very tiring. But you're still young? How old are you? Twenty-four. Same as when I met my husband. He wanted kids right away! You understand, don't you? Have you thought about it? About children. I don't think about children at all. I work a lot and I don't have time. I just want to say that children are a blessing. Ok, mom. I didn't say anything. He's very sensitive, just like his father. He has his beautiful blue eyes. May he rest in peace. Milos told me you are Slovenian. Yes, I am. But I travel a lot because of work. I was in Paris and New York. I'm going to Tokyo in a month. Nice. Tokyo. Really nice. Excuse me for a second. I thought only us girls always need to go to the toilet! Please, help yourself. Everything Ok between you two? Yes. We are in love. That's good. Very good. I am glad Milos is changing with you. It seems that culture is helping him. What do you mean? You know... When he was younger, he had a temper. He was a bit too harsh with girls. They wouldn't like that and would leave him. He wouldn't do it on purpose. He is just like every other man, you know. Just like his father. I can see he's becoming better with you. Thank goodness, because his father never did change. He did put up a good face until we got married, and then... Your husband was in the army, right? Let's not talk about it, sweetheart. I will go and heat up some of my famous pie. Where are you going? I need to go. I remembered I've an important meeting. Wait! Can't you cancel it? I can't. Thank your mom for everything. Here is the pie! Where is Iva? You tell me. What did you tell her? I didn't tell her anything. I was just fetching the pie. She left like that, without a goodbye? It's her, right? What is she saying? She doesn't want to see me anymore. My boy, she cannot be the right one for you. Listen to me, You are young, handsome, and you have a stable job. There are so many great girls out there. Not to mention, it was rude to leave like that. She is bad mannered. Am I right? Here. Have some pie. It turned out great. Where are you going? I need to buy cigarettes. Milos! Look, there she is. When you beg, you learn how to count! I got an E in mathematics. Maths are hard for me too. Stupid teacher! It's too hard for me. Mathematics are so easy! Easy? - How did you get this? - Not telling you. Fucking tell me! - You need special skills for this. - What skills? The older they are, the less they see. Is she better? She'll be out tomorrow. We'll see for how long. For God sake, can I have 5 minutes? When are you gonna be here on time? I've some problems with my mom. And please do something with that hair. Mister, do you have a coin? - I am cold. - Go away! - I am sorry can you spare a coin? - We are hungry. Please. Thank you very much. Give it! Did he enter without knocking again? Did he enter without knocking? What do you think? What a douche! Let's sabotage him. Let's mess with our hair. With his hair. The Gipsy girl. Stealing. Haven't seen your mom recently. Girl, do you have money for that? Don't want to see you out there today! Understood? Hey, kids. You should leave for a while. Our boss is gonna inspect us, it would be better if you don't... Spoil the picture. You can come back later. Ok? I've been calling all day! I told you, I'm working two shifts, today. Can't you stay with her for one day? She is your mother too! You only show up when you need money. Mister, do you have a coin? Mister, do you have a coin? Miss? This won't do. This one should be on top and that one down. Was everything Ok, mister? It's not Ok. Get those Gypsies in front of the store to leave. - That's right. - Disturbing decent folks. Make them go. I thought we agreed you would leave. I'm always nice but now you're pushing it. You can't get me fired! Money is good today. "I can't get" many things too. Get out of here, please. Now! Go or I'll call the police! Fuck you! The street is a public place! It's everyone's. Tell it to your junkie mother, you gipsy brat! What is wrong? Nothing. I got an A in maths. Come on, you worthless shit! Nothing. Crap, this is a sign. - Andrea, this is a sign! - Stop it grandma, let's go. This is a bad sign. Aren't we here to ask him for a sign? You're annoying me. Are you sure you know the way? Will you stop with the questions? Yes, this is it. No, it is not. Where are your glasses? You forgot them again. I can see. You can't see your nose without them. Show me how you write Jakob. I could be of some help, at least. Now you want to read Hebrew? You should have learned as a kid like I asked you to. We would not be here, wandering around like fools! This man used to disappear without a word, while I would worry at home. I'm sure he's still here. How would you know? Were you there when he left me and I had to take care of your father? Listen! This is crazy! I'm leaving. I'll wait for you by the car. Go! You're free! It's a free country! Do what you want. Go play with your phone. Put some like, Do some Twitter, Do some Face... some Face... She's such a pain, she has no manners. Wait. Here it is. That's it. Buenos dias. Oh, my Jakob, if you only knew what I've been through. I haven't visited in a while, she's always been a tough one. Can you imagine, she'd get sick in summer. Who the hell is sick in summer? Then, at school... Leave me out of this, it's not my fault you didn't visit. See? This come from your side. Stubborn. She got this from you. Anyway. I came here for an advice, Jakob, For a sign. She's getting married. She showed up and said she was marrying Edin, a Muslim. Not enough good men in Sarajevo, she had to find one in Brcko! Stop it! I am trying to be nice, but we won't have this argument again. I am talking to my husband, not to you. If you want to go. Did you hear, Jakob? I was saying, if she moves to Brcko, what will I do alone in Sarajevo? I just came for your advice, I came for a sign, give me a sign. It's easy for you. I had to bury you, I buried all of them. There is one thing you can do now. Please, give me a sign. Come on. Now. Here... I'm waiting. What's that doing here? What? Maybe you forgot. Someone messed with the grave. I didn't forget. I would never put such a thing there. What is this? Maybe it's a sign? Make fun of me. Excuse me. - What are you doing? - Someone messed with my grave. Rabbi Jakob's grave? Rabbi, no. Jakob, yes. - What? - What, what? I'm his wife. Rabbi Jakob didn't have a wife. Isn't it Jakob Benami's grave? From the train company, who died electrocuted. Rabbi Jakob died from diabetes. I am pretty sure about it. No, no, no! He was electrocuted. He was working on the railways. That very day, I told him not to go to work. But he didn't listen and boarded that broken train. That's why he's lying here now. I'm sorry. Can I have the vase back? Excuse us, we'll replace it. What is a vase doing on a grave, anyway? Stones are not trendy anymore? You put a stone like this! Excuse my grandma. Don't apologize for me. If you only had learned Hebrew when you were supposed to, we wouldn't be here. Are you Jewish? Yes. Do you speak Hebrew? Yes. Sepharad? Ashkenaz. - Nobody's perfect. - Stop it. Are you healthy? I have a bit of a cold actually. What do you do for a living? I work here, and in my spare time, I help my grandpa. He is a watchmaker. This is a sign, Andrea! Are you married? Grandma, stop it. Actually, not yet. She annoys me sometimes, but she is a darling. I know her, I raised her. Her parents died during the war. If you don't stop, I'm leaving. Your grandfather sends us a nice Jewish man for you. For the last time I am marrying Edin. Accept it. Over my dead body. Did you hear me? He's here because he didn't listen to me. This wedding is cursed. You will listen. You will not marry him! I will. You will not. You don't have to come to the wedding. Can I help you find his grave? Andrea! Benjamin and Rebecca. A couple. How fucking nice. Grandma! Are you Ok? Did you fall? I just sat by Benjamin and Rebecca, I couldn't find the fucking exit. Your watch is working again. The sign. I will die soon. Given that next time I come here I'll be in a coffin, you might as well leave me here. Stop it, it's not funny. Really! You won't put me in a retirement home in Brcko! Are you insane? Are you insane, what Brcko? Come on. I could shoot that Edin of yours in the head, you know. Look at the exit! It's really badly signposted. But it is nice. I like it. When you find that damned grave, burry me next to Jakob. There're no burrials here anymore. Nonsense! What are you talking about? You will bury me wherever I want!
