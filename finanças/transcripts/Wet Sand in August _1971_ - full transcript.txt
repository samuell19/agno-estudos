Hey. - When did you get back? - Just now. Do you miss the school you left? You've changed. Have I? Isn't it awkward if you're seen with me? We're already being watched. WET SAND IN AUGUST How many men raped you? I'll drive you home. Where is it? Tell me where? Well, all right. This is my brother's tea shop. No one's here now. Wait in here. I'll bring you something to wear. Where have you been this early? I went for a ride. Study hard! Good morning, sister-in-law. You got up early. Hey, wait, Kiyoshi! Give me a lift! No, I can't today. - Why? - I can't today. - But I'm asking you. - No. Help me! I just killed my mother. What? - Really? - No, just kidding. You went too far! I get it now. She had her clothes ripped off, huh? That often happens to young girls. Maybe she was raped while still only half awake. Was she gang-raped? Not that. Don't feel so down. I'll find you a cool girl. What's your type? Tell me! Damn it! Hey! Stop it, Mamoru! He wiped off the sweat again, with my sister-in-law's dress. Nishimoto, I just recalled an example sentence for the verb 'bear': "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." In this case, 'bear' means 'give'. It's worth remembering. Nogami, it's been a long time. What's that, mark-grabber? I feel depressed. Look! - Shall I open it for you? - No, thanks. I can't stand the sight of blood. You should lick it for her. A holy woman's blood will be spilt. What a waste! You may love him, but don't disturb him in his studies. Stop it. We're not in such a relationship. What do you mean by "such"? Yes, what do you mean? Kisses or petting? I wonder what "Thou shalt..." means? "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour." Have you slept with him? - Stay quiet, expelled man! - I left. Don't talk stupid. I'm going. Have a nice day! - Stop it! - Come. Come! Are you going to leave her alone? Yes. You'll regret it. Hey, wait! Sit down. It's been ages. Yes, indeed. Let me touch you. No! It's simple, isn't it? Tell Shuji I touched you. Be sure to tell him. - Hello teacher. Are you peeping? - What are you talking about? If I'd known you were there, I would've shown you something better. - I'm short-sighted. - Don't play dumb! Stop it, Nogami. Take off your glasses. - Put them back on. - Huh? Put on your glasses. You look just like a specter lemur. - Which table is this Coke for? - The fourth one. - For that woman? - Don't bother, Kiyoshi. I won't fail my exams just because I take it to her. Who are you? What's your name? But you dropped it yourself. Tell me anyway. I need to know it. Where did you stay until this morning? What about the change? It's for the glass. Let's have some Chinese noodles, Marina. - Ouch! - What's wrong? I'm sorry. What should I do? Stupid! Send for a doctor! You're following me because you have a guilty feeling. What did you do to Sanae last night? - Sanae? - My sister. I see. You won't believe me if I say there was nothing between us. I need to know about it, not to believe you. I'm responsible for her while she's staying at the villa. There really was nothing between us. - Did you kiss her, at least? - Yes, I did. And then? Lots of things... We walked on the beach, rode my bike and... Well, all right. Will you get in? Get in! Were you riding all night? Exactly. - Are you a virgin? - Huh? And are you a virgin? Where are you taking me? You don't understand yet? To the police. The police? But why? I can know almost anything about my sister at a glance. She came home at 7am, barefoot, with her clothes torn. - That was... - Explain it to the police. I don't know why she talked about me, but I'm innocent. You'll be sorry when the police confirm it. Let's go! Come on! I'm doing what you told me. Aren't you coming? Were you just threatening me? Don't make a fool of me! Say you're sorry! I'm sorry. Move aside. Where are you taking me? You don't understand yet? You'll have a good reason to take me to the police. I'm angry. You're nasty. I mean it. Damn it! I'll stop. What's wrong? You look pale. It's nothing. Don't lie to me. You don't look well. - Don't I? I'm seriously injured, then. - Me, too. I'll treat you to a drink. It should heal such an injury. Welcome. - My mother? - In the back room. Okay. Sit down. Some beer? Moron. Give us some Napoleon. Chameleon's Napoleon. Are you sure? - What's 'Chameleon'? - A reptile. Drink. No need to hesitate. I sold my mother. Such brandy is nothing at all. Go away. She goes to bed with anyone. Why not sleep with her? You haven't found that girl yet, right? She's not like that. Then, sleep with that woman. Here she comes. - Already revived? - Well, yes. - High school students can't drink alcohol. - I'm no longer one! - I'm talking about Kiyoshi. - I'm sorry. Just joking. Drink as much as you like. Ah, it's Mr Kamei's Napoleon... "Speak of the devil..." Watch carefully. A bar in the countryside is also fun. Yamada, section chief of the Construction Ministry, and clerk Suzuki. Welcome. This way. Would you see to that business? All right. I'll call him tomorrow. - There's no need to worry. - Please. Hello. You've become sun-tanned. - Do you want to go to school again? - Yes, if it's a girls' school. You haven't changed one bit. Give me a glass. It's good to have a drink with young men sometimes. And you? I'm Kiyoshi Nishimoto, his former classmate. - Did you like the liquor? - No, not at all. I'll go home. Why not stay a little longer? My heart hurts. It's serious. Wait, Kiyoshi! You're cold, virgin boy. Ken! Do you want me to call you 'father'? You definitely do, Kamematsu Kamei. Hey, Chameleon! Tell me! How did you manage to cajole my mother? He's always like this. Ken, I traded up to a bigger yacht recently. Come and see it. You belonged to the yacht club until last year, right? Yes. Please. Can I sit down? Yes. I've been looking at your sleeping face. Will you get me into trouble once again? You were having a bad dream, weren't you? - No, I wasn't. - Shh. There's someone. There's no one... Hey! Did your sister tell you anything? No, nothing. Won't you do to me what you did to her? I haven't washed my face yet. - I'll see you home. - No, thanks. It's just over there. - You're Sanae? - Yes. Goodbye. Is Kazuko Inagaki there? I have something to tell you. "And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad, "that he said, 'Escape for thy life; ""look not behind thee, neither stay thou in all the plain, ""escape to the mountain, lest thou be consumed."" Please continue, Kazuko. No. You'll need to repent. No, I won't. So, did he really touch you? Yes. I could have gone all the way. Damn it! Are you going over there? Yes, I am. Good-for-nothing! Bring it on! Bugger it! Stop it, both of you! You mustn't lose this fight. Stand up! Please stand up! Okay, stick with it! Can I actually do her? - With the cross on? - You're shameless, filthy! Don't be so vulgar! Please stop it! Help! Hey! A castaway up ahead, on the left. Stop the left oars! Hurry up! Help! Hey! Over here! Quick! Stand the oars! Grab my hand! You do it! Perform CPR on him! One, two, three... Where do you want us to take you? Beyond that promontory, please. Has he joined the navy? Maybe it's so hot he went mad. - Hey! - Hi. Come with me! Hey! What's the matter? It was them. Who are they? Don't touch it with your dirty hand! What are you doing? Watch out behind you! This bastard! Stop it! What's wrong? You bastards! Hurry up! Wait! What are you doing? Get in! Hold it! - What's all this about? - Ouch! Who is this girl? Don't get it? Ah, I get it, fool! Come back! Come to my house. - Your sister? - She went to Tokyo. That's perfect! Hurry up here, someone! Upstairs. Who is that man? Why is there a stranger in here? Maybe he has lost his way. I'm sorry. I didn't do anything. No. Don't let him leave. You bastard! Hold him down! This bastard! Don't struggle! - Stop struggling! - Here it is. - Hold his legs! Stop it! Did he die? Bastard. Man, you came at the wrong time. I heard only two women live in this house. You're unlucky. Are you listening? Only two women. If I were you, I would have done better. With this kind of thing. Don't move! Hold him by the neck. Will you kill him? Give me it. Let me do that. Give up! Hey! - What should we do with him? - Ask your girlfriend. I can put him in Goro's kennel. It's still in the shed. - Goro? - A Great Dane. It bit a man and was put down. Then he is Goro II. What's wrong, Goro? I'll walk Goro on the beach every morning. He'll massage my shoulders when I get tired. He'll bring me some food when I get hungry. - What do you think? - Good. Very good. What should we do with him? What should we do? That's enough for a sneaky thief. - How about sinking the car and him together into the sea? - A good idea! Be docile. Have some. Oh, Goro is shedding tears. That's my sister. - What's going on? - Hello. What are you doing? It's you, again. Come. - What? - Call the police. - Do it yourself. - The police again? Because I don't know the circumstances. Don't associate with these people, Sanae. But they saved me. - Who is that man? - He's a sneaky thief. I'm disgusted. Don't move, you bastard! Is that okay? He'll come back again. Maybe he'll do more harm next time. Shall I help you? You fools! This is all right. You're always involved in such things. I bet you'll get in real trouble someday. Sister-in-law. Yes? When a woman is..., or when you are... What are you talking about? When a woman is raped by a man, can't she forget about him? I'm sort of curious about it. I don't know - I've never had such an experience. An experience... Kazuko. Kazuko. Inagaki. Come downstairs, Kiyoshi! Quickly! Kiyoshi! Who are you? Bastard! Okay, that's enough. I bet you'll get in real trouble someday. Takada of the Trade and Industry Ministry talked about that recently. I don't understand how young people these days think. I heard you were attacked? You look so depressed. It's not like you. - He doesn't have a fever? - No. I'm relieved you aren't seriously injured. They can easily break an arm or two. It's terrible. Please. Okay. Ken, I think you should have various experiences while young. Try things with wild abandon. We well understand the circumstances in which you left school. You're Mr Nogami's son. I wouldn't expect anything less from you. You were right to hit the school-master and leave school. What are you trying to say, Chameleon? Well, Chameleon thinks you shouldn't exchange true liberty for trivial liberty. What's the use of causing hooligans to beat you up? It's frustrating. I understand. If you want to try something, let me know. - I'll give you some money. - I have nothing to try. Ken! - Nothing? - Nothing. Fine. How about sailing my yacht with us when you get well? I'm free at weekends. It was brave of you to fight three yakuza in an open space. Could you repeat that? I couldn't hear you very well. You fought three yakuza, didn't you? But I won't touch on that any more. Get him something delicious to eat with this money. - Please don't... - Take it. Kiyoshi. Hey. What has become of Ken? It's been a week now. He's gone away. Without a single word to us? It's no wonder - he's a grown-up. I'm rather relieved. - Really? - Yes. Come here, everyone! Get up! Who did this? Suntan Contest - Alone? - No. With the guardian. - Where? - At your brother's tea shop. Look. That's a PTA. - Shall we swim? - Okay! Wait. Damn it. Is it hard? Do you still remember the rape? I forgot about it. It must be impossible... to forget it. I forgot about it. I see. It has been on my mind. Be honest. I love you. Where is Kiyoshi? - Kiyoshi is out. - Where is he? Maybe at my tea shop. - Welcome. - Eggs, please. - Are these okay? - Those larger ones. The end of the world is approaching. The Sun will stop shining and large waves will engulf the earth. Property and honour will be no help to you. People will suffer severe hardships one after another. Like in the tale of Noah's Ark, you will remain unaware of it until just before the moment. Are you alone? - I just accepted for a drink. - I know. I'll shout. Shout. - Are you a yakuza? - Yes. I've got angry. You bloody bastard! Stop it! Set me free! Stop it! What will you do? What will I do? Here he is. Hey. I thought you were gone again. I'll go away sometime soon. This will be the last summer I'll see you. Without you, I'll feel sort of lonely... Don't be a spoiled kid! Did anything happen to you? Yes, just something... What? I heard he started learning kendo recently. - Kendo? - Swordsmanship. I couldn't believe it, either. - It's tough being a man. - So is being a woman. - Huh? - Look. Oh my goodness! I didn't promise you this. - Let me hold you. Give me all of you. - Don't touch me! Let's go. Set me free! No! She's resisting. Resisting courageously. She's shaking her head and twisting her waist to shake off his grasp. Stop it! Her well-shaped breasts are now exposed clearly in the moonlight. Great. He took off her panties. Enough! If you don't want to listen to me, look at them yourself! I'm through with you! Set me free! Well done! Well done! Damn it! "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Stupid! Who is it? You're dirty! Hey! - I've been looking for you. - What's up? Kazuko died. - You kidding? - It's true. I want to die. Me, too. I'll die. And you? I'll die, too. We can't easily die. No, we can't. - Are you afraid? - Afraid of what? Staying with me. Yes. Do you love that girl? Do it to her. And what then? And what then? Then? You'll become an adult. Bring her next Saturday. We'll go sailing on Chameleon's yacht. All right? It's dangerous. I'll shoot sea gulls, grill and eat them. They'll be delicious. No kidding. - Your friend hasn't come yet? - He'll arrive soon. He's late. Perhaps there was an accident? Don't worry. You should worry about my father. Ah, you called him your father for the first time! Was I finally promoted from Chameleon? What's he doing? Ken, I'm now fully ready. Sorry. You're slow! - Her guardian has also come. - Well, it's all right. Get on, please. Thank you. Ken, it's impossible to let three more on. - I thought it was only Kiyoshi. - Hurry up! - Kenichiro! - Quick! This isn't good. Shall we cancel it? That would be better. It's risky. Then get off. - Ken. - What do you mean? Get off the yacht! You, too. Be serious, Kenichiro. - Did you plan this all along? - Yes. You must know why I'm putting you through it. Let's set off. Start the engine! Okay. This is just for fun. There won't be anything serious. You'll regret it, Kenichiro! I would like to, if I could. - How are you feeling? - With that mess at the start... I had to make a choice between you and them. You liar! You acted on your plan. I hadn't included you in my plan. Am I a bother? No, not at all. I heard you were attacked by hired yakuza. Yes. I nearly died. I said you would get in real trouble someday. At first, I thought it was you. - I've got lots of enemies. - Only natural. - And that man was behind it? - Right. It was Chameleon. - He used them to brainwash me. - How did you... - He confessed it, while giving me a lecture. - Really? He said I had fought three yakuza. I never told anyone who or how many they were. Next time, he'll hire a killer. Maybe. - Do you still care about it? - About what? What I said in the sea, back then. I said the rape was still on my mind. If I cared, I wouldn't have come. Oops! - It's hot. - Why not change into a swimsuit? I'll do so. - Do it right now. - Can you get out? Oh, sorry. Oops, a love scene. Just kidding. Are you so worried? You're awful. I just tested you. - Get out. I'm going to change. - All right. - The wind has shifted. - Shall I do it? This should be okay. She's a nice girl. Are you going to just look at her? You shouldn't. - I didn't bring her just to do it. - But... Okay, I'll replace you. Go to the cabin. And try to gain her sister's favour. - How are you feeling? - I'm fine now. It's hot down here. - Want some? - Thanks. I'd like a juice. A juice... Here's your juice. Where are we now? Near Oshima? Not so far! - When will we return? - It's up to the Captain. It depends on food. There's still a lot left. - Won't you go up on deck? - I'll stay here a little longer. Are you afraid of getting sun-tanned? You say what we don't dare to say. Here it is. It's cold! Sanae. Yes. The skin on my back hurts. That's no wonder! - Go back to Tokyo once we return. - Huh? That's what we promised. It's finished. Ouch! Right. Fresh paint. Don't lean against the walls. Or we'll be covered with blood. I have nothing to do with this. I tried to stop you. All right. You always try to stop us. You never do anything yourself. Don't you think? No. She did something, just once. She untied the sneaky thief, against our wishes. Yes. That was great. But in fact, you were afraid of his revenge, weren't you? - What do you mean? - Nothing. In short, you don't have to take any responsibility. That's kind of you. It's like a sauna. Where are you going? - It's cooler outside. - Too late! Stubborn! You'll be sun-tanned. How about swimming? What are you doing? Hey! It's different. Come! The one outside, first. You mustn't! No! No! Kiyoshi. Quick! What are you doing? No! You first. Quick! "Turning my sea all red, "the setting sun is bleeding. "Where have the summer light and shadows gone?
