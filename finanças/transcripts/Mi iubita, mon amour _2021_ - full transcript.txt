Just kidding. There'll be go-go dancers though. Plenty of little Romanians in line, for you. Who planned this trip? Who's to thank? - What? - Not just you. - Seriously? - What? It's true. You're acting like you planned everything. Why're we even talking about that... Since I organized everything! If I hadn't, we wouldn't be here. She'd never have had days off and we would've stayed in Paris, gone to dinner and maybe... had a drink. Why did we start fighting? I don't get it. She talks as if she did everything! "I organized everything"... - I did! - "I made the choice." - But it's true. - Who cares! - We helped you. - Yes, we did. You make it sound like we did nothing. Just jumped in the car. It's not true! Who made all the calls and all that? You planned activities, that's nice, but still... You're really pissing me off. - No more cigs. - I'm stopping. - Really? - Yes. - You're stopping where? - No, look! It overtook us and you weren't even stopped. They drive crazy here. You're actually the one putting us in danger. - Fine, I'll speed up. - Good. Lola? Yes? Is Lola in a huff? - She's sleeping. - I'm talking to you. Could you please keep your mouth shut? Dance, dance, dance. Dance, dance, dance. No hands! Just kidding. Is the Romanian driver license valid in France? I don't know. In one month, I'll be a married woman. And from now on, things are getting unserious. MI IUBITA Should I ask or you'll ask? They're French. I'll ask. They're just filling up. Hi girls. - Hi. - You're French, right? Yes. - Where are you from? - Here. How come you speak French? Hurry up! I'm coming, just a sec. - How come? - What? - How come you speak French? - Romanians speak all languages. We live in Paris, but we come here sometimes. Anyway, do you have a cigarette, please? - How old are you? - 15. How old are you? I'm 11. - You can't smoke at 11. - It's for him, not me. Can't you ask yourself, like a big boy? Excuse me, can I have a cigarette, please? How old are you? I'm 21. - Here. - Thanks. What are you doing here? She's getting married soon so we'll have... A hen party. Wait, that's a Moldavian accent. - You're Moldavian? - Yeah, so what? You allied with the Ukraine. - Shit, the car! - It's our car! - Help! - Stop! Follow the car! - Come on, get out. - Jeanne, get in! Fast! Can you drive faster? Because there's no way we'll find it... No, my mom doesn't like speed. What do we do now? What will happen? Do you know if there's a town with a police station nearby? So we can report the theft. Everything's closed, you'll have to wait till morning. I'm sorry, it wasn't meant to be like this. It's all right... - No, it's not. - It's not your fault. Yes, it is. Did we leave the key inside the car? Who locked the car? - I locked the car. - Are you sure? I did, I'm sure. I remember. You locked the car? Yes, I did. - Great. - Well, I think. What'll we do with them? Where will they sleep? We don't have enough beds. They'll sleep on the floor. - Where? - On the floor! You think they'll be okay with that? What language do you speak? It's Romani. Why'd we get in that car? They're gypsies. - Have a better idea? - Than dying, yes. Stop whispering, we can hear you. Come on, don't be fussy... You're going to sleep here. Come on. I can't believe this. We're not all sleeping here, are we? I'm so thirsty. Shall I open the window? Everything was in that car. There's no point in stressing out. Let's get some sleep and... Which one do you prefer? They have insurance. It won't change anything for them. Something's off about them. They'll take us back tomorrow, it's all right. We don't even have our IDs to go back to France. We'll have to go to the Bucharest Embassy. We don't even know where we are. I'm craving a smoke. - Did you hear that? - Relax, it won't eat you. - It's just a dog. - Yes, a wild dog. Be quiet. - Do you have a phone, please? - Yes. Can I borrow it to call someone? I don't have much credit. Thanks. Hello, Victor? Darling, it's me. I can't speak too long, I borrowed someone's phone. Our car's been stolen with everything inside. We're staying with some people for the night. It's all right. Don't worry, we'll manage. - Are you sure it's safe? - Don't worry. I was supposed to join you this weekend, it was Katia's idea. - I'm coming to fetch you, all right? - Okay. - I love you. - Love you too. Thanks. What's this house? It's my future house. You want to live here, not in France? I don't know. And what do you... What do you do in France? I'll ask the questions. You came to my house... I'm asking you. To get to know you, that's all. - You don't want to tell me? - I sell stuff. What do you sell? Clothes. What do you do in France? I'm an actress. I act in movies. What kind of movies? Movies... Feature films, TV films, it depends. Action movies, love stories... - What are you doing now? - I'm off work. Why? Because I'm tired. Making movies is tiring? Yes, a bit. If you're tired, then go to bed. All right... Good night, then. Check this out. Did you sleep well? Since when do you need a t-shirt? You never get changed in the summer. - Shut up. - Stop. Come on. What's for breakfast? Nothing for them. - What do you mean? - There's nothing for them. - Where's dad? - He's not here. I'll join him. Where do you want to go? You're not allowed. - Let me go. - I just said no! Do you want a slap? You're not going there! Where is your father? He had stuff to do, he's on his way. Well, let's go. We're not going to wait. There're scorpions around here. - No there aren't. - Under the stones, I saw them. - What're you saying? - They were dead. - Want to see? - There're no scorpions. - There, under the stone I lifted. - There're no scorpions. What do you do in Paris? Study? - No, I work. - Meaning? Well... I used to live on the street, near Republique. There were a lot of concerts... on the square. I'd buy cheap beer somewhere and sell it for more at the concerts. And during the day, I dug through the trash. Why don't you do that in Romania? Because you don't realize how much stuff you throw away. - You waste so much. - In trash cans? What do you find in our trash cans? Well, shoes, clothes, gold, phones... - Gold? - You don't keep it for yourself? Sometimes I do, but I can't keep everything because I need money. Coming with us? Without our papers, he can't do anything. File a complaint, as least. We need it for the insurance... We'll make a statement... Stay around here for 48 hours. If we find it, we'll call you. Do you sometimes find stolen cars? Yes. How can I reach you? Here's my number to call them. - They're staying with you? - Yes. Let's do that. Thank you, goodbye. I'll let you know. A pack of Camels. She says we can buy a phone across the street. How much is it? It's 32. We're making a mess. What do we do now? Let's wait, what else can we do? There's no hotel around here? No, there's not. This is how I crush garlic. You don't want to eat? The girls aren't hungry. Excuse me, is the tap water safe to drink? Of course. Seriously? He just started pulling and you throw stones? Sorry. Can we swim here? Do you swim here? Yes, but be quiet please, we're fishing. You can swim over there, but here, we're fishing. There're tires, bottles and stuff, that's why I'm asking. Yes, you can swim. Do you eat what you fish here? Yes and this will be your dinner. You eat what you get from this water? I told you. This will be your dinner tonight. - What's going on? - Help me! - Pick him up. - I can't do it by myself! Drag him. Are you all right? Are you all right? You know that if we find humid soil and if we hit it with a stick, we can find bigger worms. Yes, but not here. Fear of predators makes them come out... when you hit the bottom... - This is how we used to fish. - Why not anymore? Because we found this in a box, and we took the small worms. Yes, sorry. - You're anti-marriage. - I didn't say that. - You've kind of changed your tune. - No, I just don't care. I said I don't care about marriage. I really don't care. I'd just feel like I'm imprisoned. It's just administrative, I don't see how its binding or how it makes love stronger. - It's just paperwork. - It's not. It's also a shared moment with your friends and family... Something like a ritual. You celebrate it in the here and now. You never forget it. - But you don't need marriage. - It's a commitment. I guess it's reassuring. You're actually looking for something that gives you... stability, protection. I think this debate could go on and on until tomorrow. You're just different, that's all. - That's okay. - We have plenty of time to debate. - Can we take a shower? - It's so big. Excuse me. Can we take a shower? What do they want now? They want to wash. All together? You can go. What did she say? She said you'll never fit in the shower together. They're really weird. - In the shower? - Yes. Together? Maybe they want to save water. Go! What are you doing? I'm shaving my legs. Come on, you can't use their razors! Girls, hot water's running out. It's cold! I got soap in my eye. It's hot. Can you hear the storm? - Do you feel better? - I'm fine. His name's Tarzan. We used to make money with him. He pulled the cart. So? He didn't want our car. He wants his money now. I told you not to take the car! I thought he'd take it. - What do I do? - What did you expect? - Of course he wants money! - Calm down. How can we calm down? We're screwed! We'll find a solution. There's nothing more we can do. This is bad. How much does he want? Is something wrong? I'll go and talk to him! You heard about our car? I know you're talking about it... Who do you think you are? - What's your problem? - I don't understand what's going on! We've got a family problem! I'm talking with my parents. You're being rude. Snap your fingers and that's it? If you're not happy, just get out. We're helping you here. Right, get out. Did you bring them here to have them shout in my house? What the hell is that? I don't want them in my house anymore! Here, our share. Can I clean it now? - Yes, just rinse it. - All right. What are you doing here? Come to the house. We'll eat... We're having a barbecue... We'll chat... We'll get to know each other. Come on. Let's drink together and enjoy. Cheers. How are you feeling? Is the wine good? Help yourselves. Eat. I'm not hungry. Just a bit. I've heard your story, what she told me... She sings in the bathroom. You could translate for the girls, what he can't say in French. Dad, she's writing. She told me she's already in high school. You told me you were an actress. You work in... a cafe? - A bar, something like that. - And you, you started slowly. Very slowly. I lived in very small room here. There was just the room here at first. Then I worked... My son and I, we sold clothes. Not beautiful clothes, clothes from the trash. I tried to go further away. If I'd stayed in Romania, I'd have nothing. I can't progress. - You couldn't find a job here? - Not here. I only worked here a little bit. - Is it harder to find a job here? - Yes, because... Actually, Roma are poorly regarded here. - It's even worse than in France. - Yes, that's right. In life, you can only start step by step. Because nobody will come knock on your door, "I've got something for you today." Nobody does that. Life is a game. Life is a game, even if... I feel like I'm going to cry... I'm going to cry because... I let my children live on the streets, while my wife was hospitalized. You ask questions about me. It shakes me up. Thinking about all that... You think we got all this easily? We've had a hard time. I don't know how to say... Life is a game for everybody. I said to myself, I can make it. It was good to talk. He feels good because he... He let a lot of things out. When you're a foreigner, nobody helps you. It was a bitter life, until my husband found a job. Tt was like a horror movie for us. That's what she's been saying. Look at us... We're being completely overdramatic. It's ridiculous! What are you doing here? Get up, it's dangerous. Trains pass here. You want to die? Fine, I'll die with you. Why are you sad? I'm not sad, I'm neutral. You're here to party, aren't you? Tell me what's wrong. Why are you doing that? I don't know, no reason. A train's coming! You're not allowed to smoke. I'd given it up, but I started again. Do you come here every year? No, only when we have money. What do you do when you're here? We rest. From Paris, the street. But this time we came for my mother's operation. Why didn't she have the operation in Paris? Because... If anything happens, we have to die here. On our land, in our house. Come on, we'll just stay quiet... for, let's say, 10 seconds. And we see if we hear something. I'm too scared. There can't be any ghosts in an unfinished house. Nobody's lived here. Still, it's reassuring to believe in ghosts. - It means that... - There's an explanation. It helps you interpret all the stuff you don't understand. No, it's not that. It just means there's something after. Right... You see? It means there's not nothing. I'd rather not be a ghost after I die. Why not? It's horrible. You die, that's it. Ghosts only scare people. - It must be fun though. - Fun? You're allowed to be an asshole. What are you talking about? You've got to enjoy life. It's so short. You only live once, but if you're a ghost... If you know you'll be one, you can be like, fine... when I'm a ghost, it'll be cool... I don't understand. You have one life and if there's nothing after... There's something else. For human minds, we're not smart enough to understand that it's infinite. Nothingness is not thinkable. It's horrible, that's why we fill ourselves up with pot, booze, and a lot of bullshit. And now on France Culture, an interview with Lola Freud. It's not Freud, it's Sartre. Let's play a game. - What game? - Come on. - You chat me up. - But I'm not free. There must be some difficulty. You're crazy. - You're a serial killer. - And so she can't... She's your prey and you fall in love with her. There must be something... - Improvise. - Three, two, one, go. - Hey you. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good and you? Do you fancy a drink to get to know each other? Can I have your digits? Give me your digits. Excuse me, can I have your Snap? Modern pick-up. I'm not really good with girls. Or maybe you don't want to hit on me. You could say that. I'm kidding. You're very cute. There's someone else who wants to hit on you. You know... I think you're very beautiful and... very charming but... I'm a vampire. So our romance cannot go on. It actually never started. You're losing it, it's been a while since you drank blood. Which one should I jump on? Can I suck your blood? - Which blood? My blood? - No, her blood. You want to suck her blood? - Yes. - Jeanne's? She doesn't have much. - Less than anybody else... - Just a taste. Take a real swig. Do you have a girlfriend? In real life? I'm not playing right now, it's a real question. Are you married or anything? No. And are you happy with your marriage? I am. You think it's the right choice? Are you sure of yourself? I'm just asking... Excuse me. Can we stay one more night? - Until we have news of the car? - Yes. Today's my son's birthday. - Really? - So you be nice with him. Happy birthday, Nino. - How old? - 17. He's 17? That's not what you told us. Thank you. You take this. Over there, there's no room here. Here is my space. You see the leaf? Take it like that... You see? Look. That's it. Now you go like this. Then, like that. Let's make them smaller. But why? Here in Romania, we eat big. Not small like that. Why so small? - Look, you see? - My leaf is a lot bigger. Maybe tomorrow you'll do it better. What's your tattoo? My husband's name. How long have you been married? Where's my knife? How long have you been married? - It's been 21 years. - 21 years? 20 years. - That's a long time. - Yes. Can't you see... We have big children. Go and have a rest. This will cool the fever. Go to bed. I'll come and see you. If you're ill, let them do it. They don't do anything, not the cooking, not the cleaning... - This one's too big, Nino. - This one? The leaf's too big. You should've cut it in half. Hand me the knife. Don't waste the cabbage. I took out some clothes for you to get changed. You're not well-dressed enough, for my son's birthday. Look. This is for you. This, for you. This is for you. This is for you. I'm going to fetch some earrings. Tonight, you'll be like Roma girls, not French girls. Got it? We'll wear this. She doesn't like our clothes and this is her son's birthday... She wants us to be pretty like Roma girls. Not like French girls. What? Nothing... I can't fit into this... I have no panties. You too. You two get together. You look like a real Roma girl. Excuse me. - Please, take a seat. - Thanks. Any news of the car? No. Come on, it's no big deal. Are you okay? I can see in your eyes that you're not okay. Can I do something for you? Come here. Move a little bit please. What was it? It's like... A traditional thing. You don't feel good, so I woke you up. Do you want to eat? Happy birthday to you! Come on, chill out. Freedom! Happy birthday! Drink up! Happy birthday, Nino. Careful girls, he's underage! The memories have hurt them You, my love, tell them What was has not been lost Do you know why the guitars cry? The memories have hurt them You, my love, tell them What was has not been lost The chords cry in the night The chords, the crazy ones You, my love, tell them What was has not been lost The chords cry in the night The chords, the crazy ones You, my love, tell them What was has not been lost Good evening. Bring him a drink. Yes, bring me a drink. Can you move over please? Here. I've got a job for you. I'm not interested. I'll pay you back. - Are they French? - Yes. - They're beautiful. - Yes. - You want to do it? - I'll sing a song. - The girls come with me. - No. I told you they're coming with me! - Why'd you get up? - They stay here. They're not going with you! Stop! Back off! Let me pass! Stay back or I'll shoot. - I'll kill you. - I'll get you for that. You're a dead man. - Why did you do that? - What? You're stupid! Can't you see he has us by the throat. He's always asking for more. He'll never leave us alone. He'll come and kill us! Don't worry. Help us. What are you doing? - Who was that? - Protect us from Evil. Amen. What did he want? Talk to me. Why do you keep asking questions? What do you care? Of course he'll show up. He wants his money. We won't have it. We're going to go. - You aren't staying longer? - Bye. Bye. - Where are you going? - We're leaving. - Where? - To the station and then... We'll see. I'm coming with you. I'll see you off. What are you doing? I'm going this way. This way. You don't know how to whistle? Don't look, turn around. You almost got it. Thanks. Let people get off first. Yes, she's fine. Take care. You should call Victor to reassure him. MY LOVE You shush us, but you keep talking louder. It's so funny. They're just crazy, she's crazy. It feels so good. Do you have a hairdryer in your room? Nino? Girls, Nino's here. What are you doing here? I followed you. - No way. - We told you not to come. - You don't give a damn. - I jumped on the train. My parents will kill me. They don't even know. - How are you? - Good and you? Good. You won't give me a hug? Come in. We told you not to come! It's pretty cool. I think the contrast could be nice with... It's not the right size. I've got something better, look. What about an inner tube? Awesome! It's a watermelon, give it to me. - Is it nice? - Let's get it. Let's go to the tube if you're scared. If I get married one day, but I don't think I will, I'll have fun choosing one of those awful dresses. You know, the ones they sell in Barbes. - Those hideous ones. - That's what I'm buying. She bought two in case she ruins the first. That's where Roma buy their wedding dresses. That's why I said that, their parties are so tacky. You are so checking him out! - No, I'm not. - I saw you! - Earlier, in the water. - You fancy him? - You do. - Come on, stop it. - Got you! - You're talking about me? Yes, we are. What were you saying? - Scoot over. - Why'd you lie about your age? What are you talking about, I'm 25. Why did you lie about your age? Because... I thought you wouldn't give me the cig. Just to smoke then? Don't even think about cigarettes now. - Come on. - It's forbidden by law. Why did you lie about your age? I didn't tell you because... I'm 17 but... You know, in my head... I don't have the same mind as those youngsters. I've experienced so many things. I don't think like the others, you know. I mean, like people of my age. That's why you like us? You took all my chocolate. - It's gross. - It's so good. You took all my chocolate. What flavor is that? Like Lola but the other way around. In her head, she's... She's 17. Not funny. - I'm 15 or 16, it depends. - Give me a puff. He's not allowed to, he's under 18. It's wrong! I'll tell your mommy. Mommy and daddy won't be happy. They won't even know. We'll tell them everything. That you took drugs... I'm going to tell them that... You made me smoke... - And we'll see... - You're singing it! You made me smoke and we sang and we danced... You'll see, they'll hit you. And how's it going with girls? Well... It's coming along. Do you have someone or not? - Do you have someone or not? - I have many. Many? Right now you have four around you. I have someone but it's complicated. Got a squeeze? Is that what you say at 17? Yes, I've got someone but it's difficult. It's difficult, if you know what I mean. I have nobody and... That is difficult. Having someone is not difficult. Have you had many girlfriends? Quite a lot, yeah. How many? Five. I'm kidding... You said five? I'm kidding, I didn't count them. - How many, seriously? - More than five? When did you start? You don't start counting after so many... Of course, your girlfriends from first grade don't count. It doesn't count, but I mean... Kissing under the slide doesn't count. No, but starting at 11... You had girlfriends at 11? Not real girlfriends. It's just girls you hold hands with after school. Have you ever kissed someone on the lips? - Do you want to know? - Yes, I'm asking you. Can I kiss you? It's been a long time since a boy kissed me, so let's do it. How is it going with men for you? It's complicated. - Why? - I'm complicated. What do you mean? I like boys between 16 and 17... I'm right here. - I'm just kidding. - I'm here. You're so sweet. - Have a nice evening. - Seriously, tell me. I can't... enjoy. Did you see someone? I thought it was... my father over there. - Nino? - Yes? What do you think of her? Just to... She's a beautiful woman. Except she has a little moustache. What moustache? - I don't have one. - Jeanne doesn't either. - It's just fuzz. - She does. - No. - There are little hairs. Of course, on the entire body. - You have a moustache too. - She doesn't. - I don't have one. - Katia does. You're blond so it doesn't show. Facial hair is dark for brunettes and blond for blondes. Let me see? Seriously! She's my sister, you can't do that. So tell us. Nasty boy! I saw you earlier in the water... "No, don't splash me! It's cold!" Who? - These two. - Nonsense. Yes, on the inner tube. - You were there too. - Just having fun like you. I was with Katia, with... Jeanne. - You forgot my name? - No. What do you mean you want to? Are you asking beforehand? Have you already slept with a girl? Did you sleep with the girls you dated? Yes... Yes or no? Tell me the truth, it's important. Yes. How many times? Fifty times. You've never slept with a girl. I have. Honestly, you're being a pain. Okay, I've never slept with a girl. - Is it true? - No, it's not. Is it true or not? Tell me, I can never know for sure with you. Have you slept with a girl or not? I'm not judging you or anything. - Tell me. - I've never slept with a woman. - Is it important for you? - No, it's not. - So why do you... insist? - Because I want to... Because it's important to know. The first time is important. I don't know... Why is the first time important? Because there's only one. Where can we get something to eat? Over there. Put it against your heart. Let's get something to eat? Where can we get something? Here's nice. It's broken. It's not, let me fix it. Let me fix you. Done. I'm going to fix your heart. - Let's get something to eat? - Yes. - Over there? - Yes. Six sausages... Come over here, it'll be simpler. Six sausages, six kebabs, six zucchini, what else? Address, phone number, Facebook, WhatsApp. You want my number? She doesn't like beer, but let her try it. Taste it. It's gross. - Let's clear out! - No, stop. It means "I love you" in Romanian. Where do we go now? You go back there. I don't want to. I want to go with you. It's hard to take it off. You can touch, but you don't dare. Why are you laughing? I'm not laughing. What's wrong? You need some help? My hellish trousers. All good. My love... You're beautiful. What are you doing? Where are you? Why didn't you pick up your phone? He came back. He bumped off the horse! You've got to find a solution! Ask them to help us. I don't know... And then, you come home, okay? I'm talking to you! We helped them... There's something I have to tell you. What? I have something to say, but I don't know how. Tell me. My parents... You saw that they have money problems. They couldn't even pay for the car at the mechanic. Not long ago, we asked someone for money for... For my mother's operation... Now the man's asking for much more money than we owed him... I've been asked to ask you help us. If you could give us some money. I don't even remember how we got back here. Lola, did you kiss that guy? Come on... Will you see him again before we go? You should've gone home with him. Damn, I missed that? Forget about what I said. He was cute. - Right, Helena? - Yes. I don't want you to go. I don't want to go home. - You have to go home. - I don't. I don't want to go home. I want to stay with you longer. Your parents are waiting for you. You have to go. I don't want to. Me neither. I don't want to. I won't go home. What then? You want to stay here? Yes. Why? Because... I'll only see ghosts of you there. I love you. We're going to take him back. What are you doing? Victor's coming! I'm sorry, but someone has to say something. I don't want to ask them again. They won't agree. There's nothing else I can do. So what do we do? I don't know. Think it through. Hey, Victor, how are you? Hello. I'm Victor. Hello, Ma'am. I'm Victor. Thank you very much. For the girls, and everything. You're all right? You didn't eat anything. I'm not hungry. Are you sad? You know, life is long. Look. This is the lifeline of your life. You're only at the beginning of it. And you'll move forward... It'll be very long. You're going to fall in love with a lot of people. I only want to love one. You say that because you're young. I know what I want in my life. With all the stuff I've been through, I know what I want. You think that because you're young. You don't know yet... what you're going to live, and with whom. I only want to live with one person. You say that now because you have no idea. Look at you. You're handsome, smart. You've gone through hardships. I'm afraid of losing her. Don't be afraid. It's hard to imagine that I'm going to lose the one I love. Yes, it's hard. It's too hard. It's hard, but look at me. Our memories are the most precious things. What we've lived together and what you've lived with her. It's the most beautiful thing. Come here. What's wrong? Nothing. - There's something. - No, nothing. I'm tired, that's all. You know I drove 2,000 km. It's quite a long road. No one's ever done that for you? Came and fetched you? I don't think so. I have to get some sleep. I want you to... have the life you want. The best life. Because life's too short. I want you to be happy. To do whatever you want. And to dismiss everything else. I want you to trust your heart. I want you to be happy about what's happening right now, for you to live how you want to. So you can be more free, you know. Because you don't know what can happen. Burn like rats! What's happening? Stop! Wait. Stop. Go away! Go back home, leave me alone. Leave me alone! You're crazy, stop. Stay out of it. Stop. Stop.
