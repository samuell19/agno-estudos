No, no, I'm telling you, something is off. Yeah, I-I've been over these numbers a thousand times. I didn't authorize these transactions. Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. Listen... Call a meeting in the morning. I want everyone there. I think I know who's behind this. I, Richard Washington, being of sound mind and body... not acting under duress or any influence, hereby make, publish and declare this document, my last will and testament. And hereby revoke any and all wills heretofore made by me. I hereby bequeath the entirety of all my property, both real and personal, including all shares and interests of Washington Incorporated to my last living relative, my brother's daughter, Anna Washington. - I should have known. - What the hell! - Who is Anna? - So, what does this mean? You know exactly what this means. - Means we have a new boss. - Like hell we do. I've poured my soul into this company and I'll be damned if I let some greenhorn come and take it over. James, let's talk about this... Janet, there's nothing left to talk about. Brian, you get this overruled immediately. I don't care what you have to do. I can't. He listed me as the executor of the estate. It's a conflict of interest. Then find someone else. Who the hell is Anna? And this is our final piece, titled Facing Future, from the Heartstring collection by Pamela Celestine, my former art teacher. She inspired me to become an artist. This piece along with all of the other work you've seen today, including some of my original work, is available for purchase by digital download. Just scan the QR code under any piece in the gallery. And that concludes our digital exhibition. Oh, and before you go, just please remember, all contributions help keep this gallery in operation! Thanks for coming. Hey, girl. Sorry I'm late. Where's everybody at? They're gone. The exhibition just ended. - They buy anything? - Not this time. Damn! Why did I spend all this money on refreshments? I know. Thank you for grabbing those. I promise I'll pay you back. Don't worry about it, tax write off. - Another notice? - Thirty days. Kendra, I'm gonna have to sell this gallery, I can't afford to keep it open. Anna, I told you stop doing this donations at the door crap and start charging an admission. This ain't community theater! What you need to do is set up some strobe lights, a pole, then let ya girl show off these dance moves, that, or we need to set up an OnlyFans for you and them pretty ass feet! - No. - That's your money maker. Hell, no! Hey. I had a few meetings with some high rollers who want to sponsor the gallery. All we have to do are two Instagram posts... No, no. I told you, I'm not interested... Anna, these corporations are all about looking good on social media, and what better way than to sponsor a thriving black-owned business? You better take these white guilt checks! Kendra, look around. What is thriving here? I don't want to get in bed with big business. Yes, I want to be taken seriously, as an artist and an entrepreneur, but I want to do it my way. You better act fast. Money doesn't just come calling like... - Damn. Again? - Who is it? I don't know, but it's the third time today they've called me. That could be money. Or it could be a stalker. - You ain't got no stalk... - Hey. I've been called for worse. You gonna answer that? You're the one that's been calling? - You are Anna Washington? - She is. I have some sensitive information I need to discuss with you. Alone. I don't know what Richard was thinking. He was thinking about his legacy. And I think we should give her a chance. You and I both know we should be the ones deciding the future of this company. Oh, so now it's we? - Yes, we. - Oh! And why are you okay with him giving this company to a family member no one knew existed? I knew she existed, and maybe that's why he wanted Anna to take his place. Since both he and his brother are gone, it just feels right that... No, save it, Janet. Richard's brother was tanking this company. And if Richard hadn't let him go when he did, Washington Inc. would be bankrupt right now. And if Anna is anything like her father, you and I might find ourselves in early retirement. James, she lost both of her parents at a young age, and was left with nothing. And now she's lost her last living relative. Bitch, you have a whole ass rich uncle you never told me about? My uncle and I haven't spoken in years. He and my father had a falling out, and after my father died, we never reconnected. So, I pretty much didn't have any family at all. Except you, friend. Aww. Girl. Me and you, step apart. Okay, girl, this is cute and all, but let's talk about this payday! This is next level! I thought this only happened in movies! See, this is why your ass needs to be answering your phone! I told you it was money calling! Maybe I can speak me up a damn sugar daddy... - Of course, I do wish you could. - Listen, I am alive. Thank you. Mhm-hm. I got you... this time. But you can pay me back when you get paid. Speaking of, you are going to accept everything, right? I'm still thinking about it. What's there to think about, Anna? It's not just the money and the house, he's leaving me the controlling interest of one of the biggest tech companies in the country. I don't know if I'm ready for something like that. So just take the money, girl! It ain't that deep. When are you supposed to see the attorney again? I'm supposed to meet Brian at the mansion tomorrow. Perfect. Anna, I'm sure your uncle still cared about you. Why else would he leave you everything? I don't know. And why didn't he leave anything for his business partners? I say let's find out. You coming with me? Ooh! Girl. We made it! - Wait. - For what? A marching band? Come on. Damn, hurry up. Well, hold on. We're here a bit early. Let me call Brian and make sure he knows were here. Oh! Oooh, it's open. - Come on. - Kendra, wait. Kendra, stop. What are you... Brian? Maybe he's not here. - He knows we're coming, right? - Yeah. Damn, this place is huge. Don't touch anything. Girl, shut up. Look. Come here. Look at this. That's a 14th century porcelain. - It's... priceless. - Priceless. - Careful. - You need to cut that out. You're gonna mess around and somebody's gonna shoot yo ass one day! My apologies, ladies. Let's talk inside the office. Let's. Girl... So, just sign here, and here for the house and all assets. And sign here for your shares of Washington Inc. If it's too much, you can always sell your shares to the remaining partners. Or designate an acting CEO until you've made your decision. But she still keeps the house and the money, right? Of course. Once signed, we'll begin the transfer process later this week. You better sign that paper before I sign it for you. Ooh, bitch, we rich! Would you like to discuss the transfer of shares now or later? Truthfully, I don't think I'm fit to be a CEO, but... this is my family's legacy and I don't want to just... give it away without giving it some real consideration. Take all the time you need. Until then, you can expect the funds to be wired within the next 72 hours. Congratulations, Ms. Washington. You just secured a bag. Now, boy, who taught you that? By the way, Brian, how did my uncle die? Let's see... Ah, the county medical examiner ruled it a heart attack. Possibly induced by an overdose. Actually, he died in this very room. Damn! Oh. Good. You're still here. I hope you don't mind I let myself in. Hi, Anna. It has been a long time. I'm sorry. We've met? Well, we haven't seen each other since you were a little girl, before your father passed away. I'm Janet, chief content officer of Washington Inc. As I'm so sorry for your loss. If there's anything we can do to make you more comfortable, don't hesitate to reach out. - Thank you, Janet. - Yeah. I wanted to personally welcome you to your new home and to your new position with at the company your uncle and I worked hard to build. - And my father. - Of course. And I haven't decided if I'm taking the position or not. Well, in any case, I think it'd be a good to acquaint you with the company and its lenders so you can make an informed decision. Actually, most of them will be at the Empowerment Event this weekend, which you should definitely attend. What is that? It's an event your uncle hosted every year. We do business updates, scholarship giveaways. It's always a wonderful time. And this year, we will be honoring Richard's memory. - Sounds beautiful. - And fancy. It always is. You know what, actually, it would be lovely if you spoke on Richard's behalf. Uh, I'll think about it. In the meantime, there's someone here I'd like you to meet. Anna, this is Darren. Nice to meet you, Ms. Washington. Please, call me Anna. Darren was Richard's assistant and house manager. Now... he's yours. Hey. I'm Kendra. Hi. Ooh, you work out, don't you? Okay, so, Darren, you wouldn't mind showing these ladies around and make sure Anna has everything she needs to be ready to board meeting next week. Anna, it was a pleasure seeing you again. - Welcome. - Thank you. Hi. I'm still here. Now that everyone has met, I'll leave you ladies in Darren's hands. I'd love to take you on a tour of the house, if you'd like? Why, yes, we'd absolutely love that. Absolutely. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. All right, I'm gonna head out and file the paperwork and get the transfers ready. And I think that's about everything. Well... almost everything. Who the hell is this? Victoria Washington, meet Anna Washington. Your niece. Niece? Hey, auntie. I didn't know my uncle was married. I bet you didn't. Typical distant relative trying to rush in to collect a quick check. When was the last time you talked to Richard? Victoria. You didn't even come his funeral. I didn't know... You don't deserve any of this money. Victoria! Let go. Now. Sorry. You okay? Yeah. Let's just go. Okay, that's all of it. Wow. Everything is so... extravagant. You'll get used to it. I'm going to tell the chef to start dinner. If you need anything, give me a holler. I'll be close by. Thanks. How you feeling? Honestly? Disconnected. There's not one touch of personality in here. And you know what else I've noticed? Not one family photo. I don't know, this place just kind of... reminds me what my relationship with my uncle became. Distant and unfamiliar. Don't overthink things, Anna. I'm sure you meant something to him, even if it doesn't feel like it. Look at everything he left you. Hey, I'm gonna give you a minute. I'm sure there's a hot tub around here somewhere. - Let's go. - Girl. I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'm Emily, the housekeeper. - Oh. Hi. I'm... - Anna, Anna. I know. I was the one who buzzed you and your friend in. I just wanted to make sure everything was tidy for you. I figured you'd use this room, so I put Richard's things away. They're boxed up downstairs if you want go through anything. And, for what it's worth, I'm sorry for your loss. Richard was a wonderful man. Thank you, Emily. You painted that, didn't you? When I was five. I'm amazed he kept it all these years. Yeah. Well, I'll leave you to it then. Hey, uh... There's no way he died from an overdose, right? What did you just say? Brian said my uncle died from a heart attack, but that it was caused by a drug use. Anna, I've worked for your uncle for over ten years. He enjoyed his whiskey, but he didn't use drugs. So, there's a chance he didn't die from an overdose? Dr. Jones speaking. Sorry for calling so late. My name is Anna Washington. I have some questions about an autopsy. How can I help you, Ms. Washington? Yes, I received the autopsy report for my uncle, Richard Washington. Oh! Yes, I heard about his passing. - So tragic. - Yes. I have some questions about the report. I was wondering if you might be available. Do you want a second autopsy performed? Uh, not exactly. Tell you what, I'll run a couple of more test, then be in touch. That would be great. Thank you so much. Didn't want to interrupt your call, I'm sorry. Dinner is ready. Okay. Thanks. Bitch, you know you rich when you can't pronounce what's on the plate, but you know food about to be bomb. What's wrong? - It's... nothing. - Hi, ladies. I was about to head home, but wanted to check in. Is there anything else you need? You're leaving? Why don't you stay and have dinner with us? - I'm sorry? - Dinner. Food. Have some. Yeah, we ain't eatin' all this by ourselves. - You too! - Mhm-hm. Well, if you insist. A brother is hungry. No. Okay, wait, wait. Five years working for my uncle. How was that? Some of the best years of my life. Richard was very good to me. Were you two close? I mean, we weren't best friends or anything, but... I'm really gonna miss him. So, now what? You spent five years dedicating your life to someone else. Where do you go from here? I want a chance to prove my worth. Maybe become a partner. I just want to be taken more seriously. Me too! But, as an artist. I was about to be nominated for a content creator position, but that plan is gone now along with Richard. Why is that? My uncle. James. The CFO of Washington Inc... and your number two. Oh! Your uncle's the CFO? Yeah, I don't know why, but he never supported me. If anything, he only held me back. It'd be your own people. Okay, wait, so, there is something I want to ask that's been bugging me. - What's that? - Why didn't my uncle leave anything to James or Janet or anyone else? Probably because he knows what they're capable of. And what exactly is that? What the hell are you still doing here? Enjoying my food, niece? You know you're not supposed to eat out here. None of the staff is. I asked him to join us. And he knew better than to accept. You know, it's funny, Darren. She's taking my money and my house and she's taking your opportunity for a promotion. And all she had to do was show up. - I'm sorry, Darren. - She's right. I should go. But thank you for dinner. Will you ladies be staying overnight? No. We should probably get going. Thank you so much for dinner. And please help yourselves to whatever's left. Wait! What? Why are we leaving? Because of your fake auntie? No, I'm just ready to go home. - This is your home now. - No. It's not. Let's go, Ken. Dang! Hey, girl. I got your text. What's going on? The money transferred to my account this morning! I now officially own this gallery. Paid in full! Oh, and one more thing... Little something for you. Are you for real? It's the least I could do. Thank you for always being there for me. Being your friend finally paid up! Girl, shut up! - Thank you, girl. - Of course. What's wrong? I don't know, Ken, I have mixed feelings. A part of me just feels like I would give all of this back if I could have just fixed the relationship with my uncle instead. Anna, this is what your uncle wanted! We should be celebrating him, celebrating life! Come on. You're right. You're right. - We should celebrate. - Mhm-hm. And I know just the thing. Oh, we gonna have some fun. Hey! Perfect. Nice. Very nice, little more shading. Right there. Yeah. Beautiful! Nice. Ooh, girl, I'm ready to party. Hey. - Hey, girl. - Hey. So... When you said we should celebrate, I was picturing a pool party, something, ratchet, but this? This is... This is perfect. Yeah, I'm gonna go change. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Looks like you're settling in nicely. Yeah! I figured why not do something fun? - Hey, about the other night... - Don't worry about it. You have to have thick skin in this business. Plus, I get inspiration from seeing other's success, too. Okay, well, today, let's just put that all behind us. Please, grab a canvas! Teaching is kind of my jam. Actually, I think we could use a different subject, Anna. We could? Yeah! I mean, still life is fun, but I think we could use a live model. - Oh, yes. - Yes. Uh, Darren... would you mind modeling for us? Uh, okay. Sure. Yeah, go on and lose the shirt, player. Yeah. Here we go. Damn, girl. That thing is thangin'! Oooh! - Ooh! Listen... - You are so bad. Phew! Nice job. Thanks. And thanks for modeling earlier. Sorry to put you on the spot like that. But you'd actually make a pretty good model. You think I'm good enough to be on GQ? Okay, I ain't say all that. What in the hell... Here we go again. What do you think that you're doing? Excuse me? You heard me! - What do think we doing? - I'm not talking to you! You need to pack all this stuff and get these people out of my house. - Your house? - Your house? That's right. Last I checked, my uncle left this house to me. Well, check again, honey. I'm taking your ass to court, and when I do, you'll be crawling back to the slums where you belong. You need to lower that finger if you wanna keep it. Are you threatening me? Victoria, please don't do this. Shut up. You and your worthless boy toy here need to get all these people out of my house before I come back or... Or what? How about this? You don't come back and you pack all your shit and get out of my house. And I'll have your papers served in the morning. - Okay. - Yeah, okay. Mhm-hm. That's my girl! Okay? Hmm. - Bye. - Wow! That... I am so sorry about that, everyone. Please let's get back to it. Mhm. Yo, that's the first time I've ever seen Victoria rendered speechless. I have to be honest, I kind of surprised myself with that one. That's the attitude you need to be a CEO. If that's what I decide to be. What's stopping you? I don't want to be a corporate shark, and I'm the least qualified person to be CEO, so... But then I see women like Rosalind Brewer and Thasunda Duckett, CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, so... I guess why not me? Hey. Maybe this time next year, your name would be right there with them. You think so? - Expecting an important call? - Kind of. I'm waiting for Dr. Jones to call me back. The overdose thing? I overheard your call the other day. I'm glad you're looking into it. It was... hard for me to believe, too. Yeah. I cannot believe that bastard didn't leave me anything! How am I supposed to support myself? This is ridiculous, Brian. - You have got to calm down. - Do not tell me to calm down. Listen. I'll fix this. How? I have an idea, but these things take time. I got you. You promise? I promise. Exactly what drugs were in his system when he died? I couldn't get a definitive answer, which is why the state listed his death as an overdose. Well, did you see anything that could have caused a heart attack? Maybe. While there were small amounts of drugs found, it wasn't clear if the heart attack was induced by drug use or if it was natural. Is there any way to check again? I ran the report twice. Look, Dr. Jones. He was my last blood relative and I just really want to get closure on what happened to him. I'll check with the lab to see if there are any samples left from the autopsy. If so, I'll run another test and email you the results. I really appreciate it. - Going down? - No. I need to lock up the office. - Thank you again. - No problem. Somebody! Help! Okay. What do you think? Eh. I've never been to anything like this before, I don't know what we should wear, Ken. Have you decided what you're gonna do about the CEO gig yet? I think... the position should go to someone a bit more capable than I am. Hm. Whoa. That's an interesting choice. Why, thank you, darling. It's Avant Garde. More like Savage X Fenty! What's all this? Come take a look. These are beautiful! Where did they come from? From me. Listen, I know how hard it can be trying to find the right dress. Thank you, Janet. This is so generous. Do not thank me. I'll see you in a few hours. Don't be late. - Okay? - Yes. - Okay, girl, me first. - Okay, all right, all right. - Wow! - Hey, girl, thank you. Yes, thank you. Hey. I'm... I'm sorry. No, it's okay. What do you think? I think you're amazing. I guess we should get going. Definitely. Okay. Thanks. ♪ Such a flower in the night ♪ Got me blooming in temptation ♪ ♪ You are the flashing light ♪ ♪ But it's all hallucination ♪ ♪ Time is frozen ♪ ♪ And there's only you and me... ♪ Girl, it smells like money in here. Lemme go find me a sugar daddy. Well, have fun! And don't break nothing! I'm finna break the bank, sweetie! So, most of the people here are board members or top executives from either Washington Inc. Or one of our company partners. - Got it. - Darren, good evening. You must be Anna. You look lovely. Thank you. And you are? James Buchanan, CFO. - Number two, right? - Right. Anna, I hear you'll be delivering a rousing speech for us this evening. - I might say a few words... - Terrific. I can't wait. Darren, why don't you make yourself useful and introduce Anna to our partners. That's what I was doing. Just don't screw it up this time. - Hm. - Anna. So... my nemesis is Victoria, and yours is your uncle. What a tangled web. Come on, let me show you around. Ah! - Nice to meet you. - My pleasure. - Hi, I'm Anna. - Nice to meet you. Thank you. Thank you so much. Hi. Nice to meet you. You good? Yeah. So many people... They're about to start dinner soon. Great, I'm starving. Oh, look. There's Janet. Darren! Anna! Wow! You look absolutely stunning. Thank you. And thank you so much for this dress. It fits perfectly. Yes, it does. May I see the whole... Yes, it does, honey. It's perfect. - Thank you. - Yes. You're welcome. Okay, let's talk more. What you working with? What you working with? I see your friend is enjoying herself. Yeah, that's my girl over there. We livin' large and takin' charge, baby. We finna take over this thang, okay? Started from the bottom, now we here! Tell me, is that, um, is that dress from the collection that I sent over? Well... Mhm-hm. So what do you intend to do about her? I'm not sure, yet. You think shell announce her decision about her being CEO next tonight? If she's smart, she will. She actually had the nerve to show up. Richard always made poor choices when it came to the women he kept around. That's funny. Looks like your nephew has the same problem. My nephew is none of your concern. What you should be worried about is, how insignificant your life is now that Richard's gone. Could I have everyone's attention, please? Tonight, we are here to celebrate the memory of Richard Washington... and continue the legacy of what he started here at Washington Inc. Leo Tolstoy once said that, everyone believes in changing the world, but no one... believes in changing themselves. Richard always believed in change. In fact, he challenged every one of us around him to keep growing, and keep changing. And here at Washington Inc., we will... keep growing, we will keep changing too. Yes, we will. Thank you, James. Um, I really wanna thank... all of you for joining us tonight. Um, it is especially hard with the loss of our dear friend and leader. Richard was a forward... Who's that? Oh, that's one of the dudes I'm shortlisting on my sugar daddy hunt. A little quiet, but he cool. Mhm-hm. Anna? Would you join us, please? Thank you. - You got this. - Okay. Good evening, everyone. My name is Anna Washington, and, as most of you know, I'm Richard's niece... and the daughter of William Washington, who co-founded this company with my uncle. My father often spoke about the importance of legacy. He told me... the most important thing you leave behind are the memories left with those whose lives you've touched. Washington Inc. Has been improving and touching millions of lives all over the world for more than 20 years now, with a history of leading the advancement of technology through continued innovation. As James said, my uncle wanted this company to grow. And nothing represents growth more than a new CEO. I want to ensure that the next leader of Washington Inc. Will continue my uncle's legacy of helping others reach their full potential. And so with that, I'm announcing that the new CEO of Washington Inc. will be... me. Yo, that was dope. Did you plan that? No. In fact, I need some air. Okay, bathroom's right over there. Okay. Wow! Ah! What? If this is just a sneaky link thing, that's fine. Just let me know, so were both on the same page. Oh, it's good sex, but... let's not complicate things. It was hard enough keeping it from Richard. What makes you think he didn't know? Who are you? Just hold on a second, hold on a sec... - Hey, hey, hey... - Stop! Get off me! - Listen to me. - Help! Help! Shh! Look. This is important, okay? These people aren't who you think they are. What-what do you mean? You cannot trust them. All right? Don't trust them. Hey! What the hell is going on here? I'm telling you the truth, don't trust them. You can't trust these people. - Don't trust them... - Get him out of here. Don't trust them. I'm telling you. Watch your back! They can't be trusted! Who is that man? That man is Carl Lee. Your uncle fired him before he died. He's probably trying to shake you for a check. You're gonna come across a lot of crazies like him. Just be careful. You're swimming with the sharks, now. Come on. May I help you? Anna, there's a detective here to see you. Ms. Washington, sorry for the intrusion. My name is Detective Briggs. Homicide. Homicide? Okay. How can I help you? A few days ago, you went to see Dr. Lori Jones, is that correct? That's correct. And what did you see her about? I had some questions about my uncle's autopsy report. Why, did something happen? Ms. Jones was murdered. What? And you were the last person to see her alive, that is.. In addition, all of the information regarding your uncle's death was stolen or erased from her computers. Ms. Washington, did you happen to notice anyone suspicious that evening? Anything out of place? No. Nothing that stood out. Well, if you think of something, give me a call, please. Ugh! - Girl, what are you reading? - Sinful Confessions. Girl, Bernie just walked into the courtroom but Victor said that he didn't know if she gon' tell the truth, so, Brookes might deny her bail... Kendra, Kendra. Remember I told you about that doctor I went to see? Mm-hmm. Well, apparently she was killed. Killed? Damn! Yeah. That was a detective at the door. Was he cute? Just checking. What's that face saying? You don't think it's odd that she got killed right after I asked her to check my uncle's results again? Maybe... Well, I do. It screams cover up. It's almost like... there's something someone doesn't want me to see. Okay, what does this have to do with the CEO gig? I don't know. But I think it might be a good way to find out what they're trying to hide. Okay, so now you're a CEO and Nancy Drew? It's not too late to turn around. What do you mean? Call the suit and split the shares with your girl and Darren's uncle. If someone is really out here murkin' for your seat, just sell the bag. You can always buy a new one. No. My uncle didn't give up on me, so I won't give up on him. I know. That's right. Get 'em, girl, I'm with you. I support you. You got this. It's pretty simple. Um... Did you... One second. I'll be right back. - Hi, good morning. - Good morning! Morning. Here is... your badge. And your key card. Try not to lose that. They take forever to issue. Got it. Welcome to Washington Inc! Come on, let me take you on a tour. That won't be necessary. I'll take it from here. Thank you, Darren. Oh. Um, all right. Call me if you need anything. Okay, come, Anna. Let me show you around. So, these are the executive offices. James's office is over there. My office is right there. And this... is your office. This was Richard's home away from home. He literally spent more time here than his actual house. We'll have another one made for you. So, how are you feeling? Hm? Well, last week, I was on the verge of filing for bankruptcy, and all of sudden, I'm a CEO of a major company. I don't know, I enjoy a come up as much as the next girl, but this is... - A lot. - A lot. Darren was telling me that James owned his own company before merging with Washington Inc. Mhm-hm. What is he doing here? Between us? He didn't have a choice. His company was sinking and he had to save face, so... Richard approached him with an offer that made sense at the time. Listen, I know James's is an odd fit, but he really is a good business man. And Richard was doing him a favor. Your uncle was a good man. I'm sorry to interrupt, Anna, you have a meeting in five minutes. Well, then I better get going, we don't want to make the CEO late on her first day, do we? Listen. You'll be fine. See you in there. Thanks, Darren. All right. The board is already in the conference room. You don't have much time. James is ready to start. This should be a quick and easy meeting. James is going to discuss projections and financials for the upcoming quarter. That's it. Okay. Don't worry. You got this. - Good morning. - Yeah. So, what will we be discussing today? Uh, yes. Uh, well, I know were talking... for the upcoming semester... Quarter. That's right! Quarter. And, uh... it looks like, were doing well! And we are gonna keep doing well! And so... I don't see any reason why anyone should worry. - Amen! - Not amen. James, why don't you lead for this meeting just to give Anna enough time to get used to our formats. Gladly. If everyone could open up their prospectus... to the second quarter, page two please. Anna, a word before you go. Your uncle had huge plans for this company. And as we all know, this type of work isn't meant for everyone. So, if it's too much, I can get Brian to transfer your shares over to Janet and I right now. You really should walk away before you embarrass yourself any further. Anna. I know. I'm not cut out for this. That's not what I was going to say at all.

Darren! What are you doing here? I've been trying to reach you. Kendra said you didn't come home after work and suggested I come check on you. I was worried. I've been very distracted lately. Everything is happening so fast. I can tell your uncle hates seeing me sitting in that chair. Maybe he deserves to be there more than me. I didn't mean to worry you. It's okay. I'm just glad you're all right. So... what's all this? Oh, um... Just a project I'm working on, but I was about to head out. You heading back to the mansion? I'm not sure. As big as that house is, I still feel suffocated. I could use a drink. You wanna join me? Sure. Where to? ♪ It's not the way you handle me ♪ ♪ Crazy how you get away ♪ You just entice me with the things you say ♪ ♪ Trying to stay strong ♪ - They are great. - Yeah. ♪ Hypnotizing my heart with your love ♪ You mentioned that James doesn't trust you. Why do you think that is? It's always been that way. Feels like he hates me sometimes. So... You gonna tell me why you have pictures of board members all along your wall? Don't tell me you're drawing caricatures. This is gonna sound ridiculous. Try me. Remember that call you heard me on with the doctor? Well, we met the next day... and... she was found murdered shortly after. Now maybe I'm overthinking it, but it just feels like there's something someone is trying to cover up. What do you think there is to cover up? That's what I'm hoping to find out. Hm. My uncle's put a lot of trust in me. And I... I really don't wanna mess this up. I think you're gonna do great. Cheers. ♪ Giving into you again ♪ Ohh back of one mistake My hand, this could be like... - Ahh... - Oh, my gosh! - Really good night. - Yeah. Thank you for joining me tonight.

I just wanna talk to you. That's all. Make it fast. I'm sorry about the party, okay? I didn't mean to scare you. But there's something you need to know. I was hired by your uncle to do an internal investigation. I found out that Brian, the attorney, was involved in illegal transactions using your uncle's name. I tried to give this information to Richard but he died before I could. I was told you were fired by my uncle. Richard didn't fire me. James did. Here, let me show you something. "I think Richard is on to us. We need to do something. Fast." What the hell is this? It's an email exchange between Brian and an unknown account. Where's the rest of it? You expect me to just believe this out of nowhere? No. That's why I'm giving you this. On that flash drive is proof that Brian is working with someone that has access to everything, including what you just read. I was caught downloading this information and fired before I could get all the files and email exchanges. There's a server manager that I programmed to automatically download the remaining information. All you have to do is plug that into any computer directly connected to the network. How do I know I can trust you? You can't. Trust the evidence. Anna? Everything okay? Yeah. Everything is fine. Damn! Homie has receipts on everybody. Look at this. More emails. And a list of transactions in Richard's name a few weeks before he died. A lot of the transactions were processed to an offshore account. But there's no name attached to the accounts. Just numbers. Hm. Check this out. Looks like he also has a history of taking down companies. This is from ten years ago, when your uncle's company took over your boys. James? No, he didn't take it over, it was a merger. Not according to this. Evidence supports that Washington Inc. Absorbed all controlling interests of TechNinth, thereby forcing the CEO, James Buchanan, to merge all remaining shares with Washington Inc. Since then, Buchanan now serves on the board of directors for Washington Inc. And there's a photo of him and the homeboy. Wait. That doesn't make any sense. Why wouldn't Janet tell me about that? I just didn't want to paint your uncle in a negative light. Richard absorbed as many small businesses as he could. James, unfortunately, became one of the casualties. But what I didn't know was that Richard and James made a surety agreement behind my back, which ultimately meant that James would take a position higher than mine. Um, Richard intended to fix this, but... Uh, here we are. Let me assure though, I'm still doing everything in my power to make sure this company stays afloat. What made you look into this? Well, I wasn't looking into James's company. I was investigating some other information I came across that he just so happened to be connected to. Brian. He was making illegal transactions in my uncle's name. And I think he's been embezzling from the company. What? And there's a chance James might be working with Brian, but... Okay. These are major accusation, Anna, that have to be addressed. Do you have any other evidence to prove this theory? No. But I do know there's enough information to make a case. So, what do we do next? Ah, not we, Anna. You. Being a leader means having to make difficult decisions. By the way... Where did you get this information and can you trust them? Well, I got it from Carl Lee. That guy that chased me down at the party. And you are sure you can trust him? No. But I have to trust my instincts. Okay. I can't believe you told her. Relax. I'm calling a meeting tomorrow and everything will be fine. I told you not to trust anyone. I trusted you. I trust Janet. Before Richard hired me, he knew something was happening and days after I handed him the information, I was fired and he... he died. It'd be really convenient if he just died on his own, wouldn't it? - What are you gonna do? - Smoke him out. Once Brian realizes I'm on to him, he's gonna run to his contact, and when he does, I'm putting an end to all of this. Hi, everyone. What's going on? Don't bother sitting. This won't take long. What's this? Look familiar? These are various transactions under some of my accounts... that I didn't authorize. What's going on here? Money laundering is a federal offense. You put this entire company in jeopardy with your actions. Brian, I'm terminating your position with Washington Inc., effective immediately. Money laundering? That's crazy. James? Janet? You're making a huge mistake. No, you made the mistake thinking we wouldn't find out. You can't fire him without an HR investigation. I'm more worried about the feds than a lawsuit. And last I checked, HR works for me. Where did you get this information? It doesn't matter, James. Aren't you the CFO? You should have caught this. You should be grateful I stopped this company from going under due to your negligence. Your father was impulsive like this, too. And look where that got him. Do you think I made the right decision? It's not about right or wrong. You trusted your intuition, did what's best for the company, and that's all that matters. Your uncle would be proud. Who does that bitch think she is, firing you? And for what? Doesn't matter, because it's not true. Well, whatever you've got up your sleeve, now's the time to use it. I definitely won't be letting them get away with this. Them? Her! Everything fell apart since that bum ass came to town. We need to finish her. All right, I'm sorry, okay? Is there anything I can do to make it better? As much as I would love to take this office for one last ride, I really need to pack up and be out of here. Okay. Well, um... how about I stop by your place and... throw on something sexy? That sounds great. Hmm. All right. Hello? Mhm-hm. I'm getting my ass out of here. What are you doing here? Came to rub it in, huh? What the hell! No, please... Afternoon. I'm gonna need to ask you all some questions. I'll assume your company has a representative I can speak to? An attorney maybe? Oh, okay. Um, well, can any of you tell me if there was any suspicious activity here in the last 24 hours? Well, his last day of employment here was yesterday. He was here cleaning out his office, so there wasn't anyone else here. That we know of, anyway. Okay. Well, when you've designated a replacement, have them reach out to me. I'll be in touch. - You! - Victoria, not now... No! This is your fault! That was for Brian. - Hey. - Get off me! Come on. No. No. You wanna press charges? No. I just want to go home. I'm sure you do. Hell of a first month on the job, huh? Let's get outta here. So, looking at the numbers here and you have to see if... Hey, Anna. James wants to see you. - I'll be right back. - Yeah. Hi, everyone. What's going on? Anna, I'm going to ask you this one time. Who was the source of your information? Something tells me you already know the answer to that. Anna, I tried to give you a shot. I really did. But you've proven to be even more reckless than your father and your uncle. Excuse me. Also because of your actions this corporation is under criminal investigation and now, because of you, a man is dead. James, the evidence... Came from a man that tried to blackmail this company with information that we previously determined was false after an internal investigation. That's who you were getting your evidence from. This doesn't make any sense. He said he was working... He wasn't working for your uncle, Anna. He was working with him. Anna, before Richard died, he was under investigation. We suspected he had been moving shares to overseas accounts, but we couldn't prove anything yet. Yes, we had our own suspicions we were going to remove him as CEO until we could conclude our investigation. - You're lying. - I wish I were. When Richard died, we decided to keep it quiet. I never wanted you to find out like this. Anna, your actions have put us all in danger and there's no telling what other consequences will come from this, so, Anna, we, the board, have voted and decided that due to the impact of your actions... you are hereby ordered to step down as CEO of Washington Inc. Effective immediately. - Wait, what? - You can't do that. We can. And we have. Anna, I'm-I'm so sorry. I had to say something. It's no wonder my uncle didn't leave you anything. You really can't be trusted. Neither of you. - Hello? - Girl. Turn on the news. In other news, authorities have arrested 32-year-old Victoria Washington, widow of recently deceased Washington Inc. CEO, Richard Washington, as a suspect in the killing of Brian Lancaster, whose body was discovered inside the corporate offices of Washington Inc. After the murder weapon was discovered in her vehicle... See! I knew that bitch was crazy. Just hours before his murder, Lancaster had been fired by Washington Inc.'s newcomer CEO, Anna Washington... Hm, they could have used a better picture of you. - Kendra, I gotta go. - Wait, girl... No, ah! Every time this game. Come on, come on, come on. Forget it. I'm going over there. Carl? Carl! What do we got? Ms. Washington, you and I are overdue for a talk. Once again, I have a dead body and you're the last person seen with them. What are you saying? I'm saying, unless you can provide some solid answers and alibis, I'm gonna have to take you down to the station for additional questioning. Why would I need alibis? Am I a suspect? Not yet, but you're a person of interest. Like I mentioned in my statement, I found Carl like this. So what other questions would you have to ask me? For starters, why do people at your company keep ending up dead? And why you seem to be at the center of it. Anna, I need to know. Is there anyone else you think could be in danger? Hey, Anna. It's me. Um, I feel really horrible about what happened earlier. I just, I want you to know I understand how you feel and, um... hope this doesn't change things between us. I mean, I'd actually still like to be there for you if you'll let me. So, just, um, give me a call when you can. And then he told me to not leave town! What? Girl, bye! Carl was on to something and... I'm still convinced Brian wasn't working alone. But whoever he was working with killed him and possibly killed my uncle to cover this up and I could be next. But we can get all the proof we need with this. "We?" Are you sure about this? Well, no, but... I'm sure my uncle was set up. And this is the only way to find out. Girl, why I always gotta be caught up in your Shelby Woo mess? Fine. Where we going? Ohh! I know you lyin'! I'll be in and out! I promise! We both know that's a damn lie. How do you plan on getting in? They are not gonna deactivate until tomorrow morning. Shh, it's Darren! Don't answer it, don't answer it. No! - Hey, you. - Hey! I just saw the news and wanted to check on you. Aw, you're sweet. I'm fine, really. You sure? I can come over later, if you want. Um, sure. That would be great. Okay. Are you home right now? I-I have to go. Kendra's calling me. Okay, we don't have a lot of time. It's now or never. Anna, this is crazy. You don't work here no more. This is breaking the law and you're trespassing. When you got to jail, I can still live in the mansion, right? Just checking. I had to ask. Okay. Okay, bye. Hurry up! Bitch, run! Come on! Come here, come! Go, go, go, go! - Here we go! I'm going. - Go, go, go! Okay. Now, let's find out who's name is linked to all those transactions we saw before. This too much! How do you narrow it down to the one person? There has to be a database that matches a name to one of these. Can you search by name? Look, transaction records from Brian, but they don't match the IP address of his computer. Which means these emails didn't originate from his account. That means the attorney was... Innocent. So, Brian was set up? By who? Nothing. I-I-I don't understand... Run that back! Ain't nobody that clean! No. James is clear. What about your girl? Janet? There's no way. Damn. Guess not. So, who's left? Maybe someone else on the board? You never know when you're dealin' with the opps. It could be anyone. I'll give these files to Detective Briggs in the morning and let him figure it out. That's a good idea. Well, this has been fun. I'm going to bed. Yeah, I guess I should go to bed, too. No. - Hey! - Hey. You. Everything good? Yeah. Why? Just checking. I called you, but... it went to voicemail. Yeah, my-my phone died. Let's go to bed. Come on. Let's go. Goodnight. Goodnight, Darren. Shh! Anna? What's going on? I don't have time to explain. I need you to call the police and meet us out front. Hurry. Okay. Kendra! Kendra. Kendra, wake up! - The hell! What's wrong, girl? - Shh! - We have to get outta here! - And go where? Girl, ain't nothin' open but legs and liquor stores! - It's Darren! - What about him? - He's the one! - You sure? Yes! Get dressed and I'll explain. Come along. Dammit! - What about Emily? - She's meeting us outside. Um. You sure about that? No. - Anna, wait... - Let go of me. Aww, damn! Oh! Oh! Ah! You dropped something... at the office. James? Where's Kendra? You just couldn't be... happy, could you? A big house, millions of dollars, and you didn't have to lift a finger. But you just had to have more. I tried to keep you safe. I didn't want you to end up like your uncle. How could you do this... to me? You did this to yourself. I was just following orders. Following orders? From who? From me. - Janet? - Yeah. And your uncle made a lot of promises he didn't keep. Especially the ones he made to me. So I got rid of him, by putting Oleander in his whiskey. And that's why it didn't show up in the autopsy report you were looking for. And-and framing him, that was even easier, using Brian's cloned IP address to generate the overseas transactions. Ah, it was perfect. But once Darren told me you were still investigating I realized that I had to move fast, even if that meant a few... casualties in the process. But you did help a sister out once you fired Brian, made him just a easy target! Right? And here we are. However, you did good... by bringing us all of the evidence, so the police will never be able to trace it back to us, And for that, we thank you. Hm, and when it's all said and done... you'll be the obvious... scapegoat. I mean, you... killed your business partner and his last blood relative in a fit of rage so you could run the company. You know, the headlines will eat that up, right? Hmm. And as for you... Once you are out of the way, then I'll take over Washington Inc. as CEO... and your uncle's legacy will be ruined forever. It's a shame, really. 'Cause I like you, Anna. I do. I like both of you. Thanks for everything, D. But I'm gonna, I'm gonna take it from here. Janet, no! Shut up! Just pull it, Anna. This is your moment. Do it for your uncle. Freeze! Freeze! Let me go! Thank you so much. - What's this? - Evidence. They were draining the company. Moving money overseas and trying to frame my uncle and Brian. Money laundering, too? Where'd you get this? Carl Lee gave it to me. Before he... you know. You just made my job a lot easier. Thank you, I'll be in touch. What'd you have on me on that thing? Ha! Surprisingly, nothing. Huh... Losing my company was one of the hardest things that I've ever done. Hundreds lost their jobs... but your uncle made sure all of us were taken care of. We didn't always see eye to eye. But I respected him tremendously. And I hope he knew that. Thank you for clearing his name. I'll speak with the board first thing to make sure... that you are reinstated. Thank you. I was so scared you were dead, Ken. Bitch, me too! But I came back like the Undertaker on y'all's ass! While y'all were talkin', I was able to call the cops and get them here. I guess that means ya girl Victoria is off the hook. Wish I could see her face when they let her out. The next time yo ass gets rich, I'm staying home. No, you know you lying. Besides, I don't have any more family you have to worry about. Good. Keep it that way. Hm, girl, look at his fine ass. I-I-I gotta go.
