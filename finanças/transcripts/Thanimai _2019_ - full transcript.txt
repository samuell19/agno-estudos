This is the camp I told you about. This one is it? You know about the places that even I don't. Officer will be here Come on, let's go and have a look inside. This is the A O office. Please come inside and take a seat. Please sit. What made you come over here? In 2009, May Month... I became unconscious during the time of my delivery. Looking at my critical condition, a lady doctor... had taken me by airlift to Malaysia. I recently got to know that the baby had survived during the delivery. That's why I've come in search of it. You've come back after 9 years. That's not a baby He's a boy who's now going to school. Sir, it doesn't matter whether it's boy or a baby. The mother who gave birth to her child has come in search of it. Please just tell us where the child is, we'll go and find it by ourselves. According to the government rules, information regarding the people inhabited here, can only be provided to the police and revenue department. We can't share that with someone else. You can write to the police and find out through them, only then we can share the details about your child. Oh! I'll go to the police station like you said But can I see my child just for now? Okay, I understand your curiosity. I myself have only been here for 6 months. Many people were shifted to Chennai... and Trichy after the storm that came in 2012. Like you said there aren't any children here, but only a few people and that too only old people. Anyway, it's better for you to give a complaint to the police station. Oh! Brother, let's go to the police station. Okay, thank you. If you find any details about the child, then please do call and inform us about it. Okay, will surely do. Thank you. Even after 9 years, there's no big change to this place. The camp is just the same. It's about how this place was built, that's why there are no major changes to it. Whatever, if you get your child back, that's enough Come on dear, let's go Come. You do know where the police station is right? Hello, I'm asking you only! When I look at your problems, my problems are nothing, dear. But, whenever you speak I can't figure it out. I can never be like you, dear. I want to learn to be like that. You want to go to the police station right? I'll take you there. Come, let's go. Come, let's go. 'Mandapam, police station' Sir, we need to give a complaint. Please sit. So tell me, what's the complaint about? Flashback is being narrated... Oh! Okay, please do write and give us a written complaint. Brother, do you have a pen? Sir, do you have a pen? Dear, you don't have to be in a hurry. The current inspector has been transferred... and it will take 3 days for the new inspector to come He is take investigate about the issue. Sir! What's the case about? It's nothing much, sir. It's about a child missing. Madam, you please leave now and come back after 3 days. Come dear. Due to the compulsion of the hospital management, I forced people with normal deliveries to do a caesarean. Repenting for my sins I came to Kasi and Rameswaram. When I saw you in that situation, I saved you and got rid of my sins. When you were unconscious... the government too helped in airlifting you. You survived and so did your child. That guy, Thangadurai who came along with you was the... one who told me not to inform Yazhini about the child Or else she'd go back to Sri Lanka to fight. That's why I didn't tell you about your son Please forgive me. Here dear, take some Pori. I'm giving her the Pori to eat and she's throwing it for the fishes to eat Maybe foreigners are like that. Dear, the Pori vendor told me That for all my problems to solve, I should go in the morning and take a bath in the ocean, followed by a bath in the temple with 21 pots of water. I thought I'd do that and go home tomorrow. Only when the new inspector gets back, I will get the information from the camp. Can you give me some company till then? I'll pay for the overall charges. That's okay dear, I will be with you. If you want shall I book a room for you too in the hotel that I'm staying in? There's no need of that dear. Why do I need a room? I'll sleep in my car. Dear, if too you take a bath in the ocean in the morning, then you will get back your long-lost son. I'll come in the morning. Is it? You'll come right? Okay. (Chanting) Can we keep the bag here? Give it here, dear. What are you just keeping it and going like that? Sir, we're just going to take a bath in the ocean Please take care of this bag for a little while. Okay, go and come back soon. - Okay sir, come dear. - Let me remove my slippers. Oh! Yes, please remove it, dear. Come. Oh! So we must bath here and also take a bath in the temple is it? Yes, dear! They'll pour 21 pots of water. Oh! So after this we must take a bath in the temple as well. Dip yourself three times nicely in the water; let all your problems go. All my problem comes to end. (Chanting) You people came to the police station yesterday to give a complaint right? Who are you? He's the inspector we saw yesterday at the police station. I couldn't even recognize him. He said that the child was missing. From when was the child missing? She gave birth to her baby in 2009... when she was unconscious and then left the child and went to Malaysia, So she's come here to get her child back. Yeah, who are you though? I am a taxi driver. I've brought from Madurai. Okay! Who told you to give a complaint? I only told... (Interrupted) I went to Mandamp camp; they insisted me to give a complaint. When each of you go like that, they'll tell you to follow the procedure. What to do, sir? They make us wander about like this. You people go to the temple, finish your prayers and get back to the police quarters I'll go to the camp and have a check. You won't be coming to the temple is it? I only go to the Perumal temple. And also maintain some distance with such drivers. He's not the way you think. He's a very nice person. After you worship the God go to the quarters to have break fast I guess that the temple will be very crowded today. I'll do one thing, I'll send my constable along with you and he'll take care of you. Okay? Here, sir. Come on let's go, dear. Constable, call me after you're done. Okay sir, I'll take care. Go! It's only been 2 months since sir came here. When he came he was normal. Don't know what the priest told him... that he start growing a ponytail and became very holy. The superintendent of police didn't like that and transferred him to Chennai. What did he tell you, dear? He told me that you've come here alone, so be careful. Policemen always see everything in suspicious way. He didn't say anything like that Come let's worship God. Sir's wife is a sub-inspector in Chennai. Oh! So he's been living alone in the police quarters. That's why sir eats at the mess. Oh. Hey driver, go have something to eat in the nearby hotel and come and wait here. Okay. Sir? Come in! Greetings sir! Did you people finish the worship? I showed them everything in the temple, just like you said. Can I take your leave, sir? - You may leave now - Okay sir. You please come inside. Come.

It seems that she had left her child here in 2009. She came here yesterday And after that I searched for the records, But only the records after 2014 are available here. Then what about the records before 2014? They were sent to the Chennai office to computerise them. Where's the person who dealt with the records of 2009? He's now a deputy director in Chennai. I spoke to him yesterday on the phone. What did he say? Because of madam's complication in her pregnancy, she became unconscious... and was later admitted in a hospital in Madurai. Due to her critical condition, a Malaysian lady doctor had taken her to Malaysia. Then what about my child? It seems that the premature baby was very serious at first, But it later got recovered after few days. How do we gather information regarding the boy? You can find out the details about the boy in the Chennai office... or the Sri Lankan high commission office. Okay, thank you. Thank you. I'll join you after I change my clothes.

But, he's having some debt issues He's a good guy, that's why I gave him some extra money. So you're feeling pity for the driver.

Okay, bring 2 lakhs and give it to me at the station. I have a lot of expenses. Hmmm... You're very popular. There won't be anybody else asking for a share right? You'll only get 5,000 rupees. Greetings sir! Yeah, I got information that a Sri Lankan family has come from Rameswaram. Do you know where they are? There was a family but they have gone back to Sri Lanka Okay. It has been many days since they have gone. Are you doing fine? I came to your house to meet you, but you weren't there. Is your phone number the same? Hey! I had asked you to have a check on Munusamy's matter, did you? Yes, sir Stop whiling away the time. Go now! Okay, sir. You don't see any fair person. You seem to be worse than my 3rd husband who ran away. You made me come up to the police station. Hey? Will 50,000 come from the air? You got to work hard for it, got it? Look here... That guy is trying to make a 2 lakhs out of us, so we have to foil his plans now. Okay? Sir! I last saw you while receiving the money. Sir, I have the money intact. - What is she saying, man? - Sir I was about to tell you that she's scared that if she gives you the 2 lakhs now, then with the 6 lakhs that was received, she had to sign for receiving the 8 lakhs. For what should you be scared for? Shall I give you an idea, sir? If you change the house agreement to your name, then even if that lady vacates, you will still be able to maintain that house sir. Then what should we do with the old agreement? We can tear that off, sir. If you wish anything can happen. I'll get it signed from, sir. Take it out soon. Sir, keep this 2 lakhs with you. Give that agreement to me, dear. Let's get it signed from sir, before the auspicious time ends. Sir, please put your signature here. Dear, you too put your signature. Here, sign it. Okay sir, you keep the copy of what she signed. Here you keep this with you, dear. Sir, keep it safely at home. You go, dear. Sir, I will send her off and come. Okay. Here, drink milk. No, I don't want it, you drink it. I finished drinking, I got this for you. I'll drink it later. Didn't your astrologer tell anything about your tattoo? Okay, turn off the lights and come sleep on the bed. No no, I'll sleep here itself. You think that your purity will go away by sleeping on the bed? Now, what do you want? I want everything, whatever I have been giving over these years, I want all of that. The child is sleeping outside, please talk softly. Only now you realise that she is sleeping outside? So many days in her presence, you've done so many things? Hey Raji, come here! Are you trying to cause problems? What is it mom? What happened? Nothing sweetheart, you go sleep. Go. Your dad thinks that his purity will go away by sleeping on the bed. He seems to say that I'm a different caste and he is a different caste. Now, when did I tell you all that? Why are you lying to her? Hey fraud, if I give you milk you aren't drinking it, you're not eating at home. What are you pretending? Whatever it is, let's talk in the morning. Go sleep. What? What do you think of yourself? Fraud! Get out, man! You're hitting me is it? Eating my food and living in the house that my father bought, you're hitting me? Get out, man! If you stay here even for a minute in this house, I'll stab myself with this knife. Get out, man! Mom, please don't do it! Dad, please go outside. Get out! Go outside! You said that it's your father's house right? Next time if I come here you can say, dog, why did you come here? Eating my food and living in the house that my father bought, you're hitting me? Get out, man! Fraud! Get out, man! It's fine if he did his atrocities when he had his hair on, I thought he'd change now after his head shaved by keeping a ponytail and looking holy, but he's turned out to be even worse than before. He brought a fair lady and even got a home, and that too he caught an NRI person. He will never change. Searching for him has become my duty now. Has he been sloshed inside the car? Where has he gone? Has he committed suicide or something? He's not one that does these things. He'll only do that to others. Will the 2 lakhs be on my head now? Sir! I had to search for you everywhere. Everyone's searching for you, you've also kept your phone switched off. Sir, Yazhini madam is also in search of you. You told that you'll be taking her to the Sri Lankan consulate, regarding her son. Sir, please come. It must surely be Yazhini madam who's calling me. Hello! Hello, I'm Yazhini speaking. Yes, tell me madam? Where are you? Sir is sleeping on the steps by the pond of the Kothandaramar temple. Oh you've come is it? Please wait, I'll come there. Please come, madam. See where he's sleeping. What happened? Why is he sleeping over here? Sir's wife is a sub-inspector. That lady chased him out of the house. For what? Sir's a Brahmin that lady is of a different caste. She kept quiet when he wasn't much into the religion. One day, when he suddenly came home with a ponytail, she got very pissed and cut his ponytail off. Come! I'll stay here, you bring him and come. Okay, madam. Sir, Yazhini madam has come. Come! She's calling you home. Please come, Sir, this happens in every house. Now, please come. Madam, look how badly she's cut his ponytail off by causing a wound. Oh my, what kind of a woman is she? Sir, please wear your slippers. Come sir, let's go. Sir, you take madam and go home. I'll take the jeep and leave it at the police station and will come back and take my bike. Okay, sir?

He's going to wake up. You morons, you'll have stolen my car! I started driving the car, because the video camera was broken these thieves have even taken the car away from me. How will I sort out my debts? If my owner gets to know about this, he'd chase and hit me all the way. I couldn't pay back my old debt, that's why I started driving the car. Greetings, madam! What is it? It seems that there's a file inside the TV cupboard. Sir, told me to bring it and give it to the writer. Where is he? He's gone to Andhra for work. It's a 3:30 train, madam. Wait! She's taken it and is grilling me. Mom, move! Keep watching TV all the time. Fraud! He's made a lease agreement without me knowing about it. Why has he taken this house? Hey! Tell him to come and see it himself. Okay, madam! It's always like this. I'm stuck here like a little calf. I chose to join this profession. Hey! Turn off the TV and leave. Who are you?

Hey dear, wake up! The warden has asked me to take you to the doctor. Doctor, there were a lot of wounds in her body on the day she was remanded.

Take her back to the cell once the trips are done. Yazhini, we must go to court. Come, get inside the van. "Fear is but foolishness." "Courage is a trait of the Dravidians." "Whether your death is at 6 or 100," "it is your duty to protect your motherland." "it is your duty to protect your motherland." Sir! Tell me, dear? There's a person I know that has been arrested. They aren't giving us a bail. Only you can somehow help us in getting a bail from the high court. Please help us, sir. It's nothing, don't worry. Sir, they won't be able to pay much for the fees. That's alright! Thank you, sir. Hey, don't act too much. Yeah, where did you go in the morning at 3 o'clock? - I went to Koyambedu, sir. - Koyambedu?

Sir, he's begging you to somehow change these notes for him. How? Shall I keep this coat aside and join your profession? Brother, you brought your money and came here listening to this guy.

It seems that we have a nation for ourselves with Tamil as our mother tongue. You come take me and go with you. I wish to see how you look just for once. Everybody says that I will look like this. I thought that only I am a big activist, but your son is really great. Born to prove! I'll post the matter for mediation.

He'll do anything for money. I feel so bad that they've suspended us But he isn't even bothered about it. You both fell in love and then got married right? He's a Brahmin I'm a Non-Brahmin. His house is right next to mine. I've been cheated. I've learnt a good lesson. In these 8 years there's not a fraudulent work he hasn't done. I only kept bearing up with him for my daughter. When I met him in Rameswaram, I thought that he's a very good man. He keeps cheating all the girls with that look. Govindhan is my classmate. He will take care of you properly. If you say that you've excused them, then they will remove the suspension. What for that? I'll ask the advocate to make a compromise. Please return all of her things, including the DD and passport.

What to say? Mom, why did you scream at me without any decency in front of everybody? You told that I was dancing without wearing a dress in front of my friends. What will my friends think of me? Why are you sitting like a statue? Look at what she's saying. Now what did I do so wrong that you're screaming at me for? Every time you keep proving that you're uneducated. Yes lady, I'm uneducated. That's why I married a man who's 15 years older to me and running a family. Now, what are you trying to say? You were talking for so long, why aren't you saying anything when she's here? She's brought disgrace to the family. Before she runs away with anybody, stop her studies and get her married, because she needs the company of a man. She's an educated girl And her friends are with her. Why did you have to speak like that? I only spoke about what you said. You said that I didn't bring her up properly. Okay, but for that you'll speak like this is it? Okay, okay, you go console her and call her to eat. What is this? Where are you all going? What is happening here? I didn't think that our son would do like this Givindhan showed your ancestry attitude I felt ashamed in front of the lawyer What man, the function went well right? It was great, brother. Yeah, why did the two of you come back without eating? Even though your father's a cobbler, he had his own respect. Now, what happened? Your father's heart is very broken. I've never see him like this. Why did you do like this? Mom, now what has happened that you're speaking like this? Nothing happened When you were carrying advocate sir's daughter... and dancing with her without knowing your status, I couldn't see their faces. You've disgraced us nicely. Mother, you're talking like I willfully danced like that. That girl came by herself and started dancing with me. And what is that status? It's nothing, son. Just know about one thing, mother. In this world everybody's equal. I told you right? Ever since he started studying law, his behaviour has been changed. He says that everyone's equal. If that lawyer sir wasn't there for us, we won't be having anything, Including this house. Father, if you keeping talking like this, there's going to be no meaning for me to stay in this house. If you really do care about your son, then come to the place where I'm going to be in. The cop's daughter is feeling better now Sister, since then he's always been like this. He keeps drinking and blabbering all the time. Can you promise me one thing? Tell me sister, I'll do it. I feel so bad to see him blabbering at night. You must somehow join him back with his mother, only you can do that. I'll surely do it sister They'll surely reconcile together. Only I know the pain of a mother and son being apart from each other. Tell him that I told you to take him to the village, okay? Yeah, I'll surely take him and go. You started drinking is it? Hey, hold this. I need to speak with you. Yeah tell me, what is it? You should come with me to Sri Lanka to find my son. Sri Lanka is it? Only you can help me out. Okay, we'll talk in the morning. You please leave now. You must do me another favour. What is it? You must go and meet your mother. Why? Your mother must be feeling the same way, the way I'm dying to meet my son. Whatever it is, we'll talk in the morning. Please go. We'll talk in the morning, go! You take Govindhan to Sri Lanka. He'll be very helpful for you. He's not like any other person. He will take care of you properly. Sister, tomorrow morning you go to my travel agent I will come there along with him after he meets his mother You can go to Sri Lanka after he gets the passport Give this to your parents. Why all this? Give this chain to your mother and ask her to wear it on. You never wore it till the end. Whether you're going to wear it or not, let this be with you. I'll take your leave. Hey, the car isn't getting started. Get down, we'll see to it tomorrow. Why brother? No, no, you sit inside. I'll push the car from behind. Velayudham, you too come. Yeah, coming sister. Push it. Start the car. I told you right. The car isn't getting started. The car itself doesn't like me going to the village. We'll see to it another day. No, no, you must go meet your mother and come back. But the car isn't getting started. Brother! Come brother, let's go in our vehicle. Hmmm. Okay. I'll go and come back. Hey! Come buddy! What buddy? Where are you going? I'm going to meet my mother.
