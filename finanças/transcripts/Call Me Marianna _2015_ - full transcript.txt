OK, let's start. He and she are in bed together. -"What time is it?" -"A bit past eight." "I need to get going." "Please stay." "I can't. My parents are waiting." "Why don't we make a baby?" "What?" "That way we'll always be together." "Always?" "Yes." "For better and for worse, for richer and poorer, "in sickness and in health, till death us do part." CALL ME MARIANNA That's not for cats. You won't like it. That's right, kitty. Poor, little cat. Sunrise at 7.32am, sunset at 3.38pm. At exactly 8 hours and 6 minutes, the day is one minute longer than the shortest day. 10 days till Christmas. 17 days till New Year's Eve. You're listening to "Neither Here nor There." ENTRANCE You want to cover the costs. Not to burden your parents. So we will file an application for you to cover the costs. Right at the beginning of the hearing. Yes. It will send a good signal. That's what I want. The judge is going to like it. After all, this is about my life and my gender. My parents were sucked into all this, because the legal system is what it is. I don't want them to have to pay for any of it. Precisely. Now, this way. That's why I want to do it. Today will be the final hearing. I wonder what they'll ask me. You had preliminary hearings before. You need to confirm your previous testimony. You need to say you want this ordeal to be over. That you want to proceed with sex reassignment, and that your decision is irreversible and final. You will have 5 or 10 minutes. You need to make them see your anguish, your trauma. I also want to say that I realize this is also traumatic for my family. Focus on yourself. Talk only about yourself. Your family will also give their testimony. Wojciech Klapczynski vs. Ewa and Adam Klapczynski. Hi, Mom. How are you? How is your health? I've been better. I just wanted to talk. If you want to talk, then speak normally. -I'm not speaking normally? -Please talk to me like a son. I wanted to call you. I made the effort to call. I dream about all of you, Mom. I think about you all the time, day and night. I worry about you. You think I don't care? I know you and Dad are both ill. And we might never see each other again. You tell me to act normal and be a child to you. Do you even remember it's my birthday today? -I do. -I'll never call you again. I'm sorry I called today. I promise this was the last time, OK? He needs to update his legal status. He needs to formally change all his papers. To become a woman in the eyes of the law. So the court rules that he needs to sue his parents. That's when the big conflict between them begins. By being a party to the proceedings, do his parents have any actual power? Can they refuse their consent? -They can refuse. -What happens then? They start threatening him. They tell him they will place him in a mental institution. That really scares him. Let's get back to the scene. If he's being so emphatic when she says: "Will you still love me a year from now?" He says: "Even more." "And in ten years?" "Even more." "And in a hundred years?" And then he says at the end: "I will always love you." Yes. It's true. What's true? He wants to... He desperately tries to stay with her. Forever. Hello? Hello? Yes? May I speak to Kasia? Hi. Who answered the phone? Was that one of the girls' boyfriends? Why? It was a man, that's for sure. Why do you ask? Just asking. Wondering if you've settled down with someone. I'm doing my best. Can I ask you something? Could we get together and talk? What for? You know... Of course, I'll understand if... Like I was saying... I just want to talk, no hidden agenda. I know, but I don't think we should go back to this. Let's just drop it. Do our girls ever want to talk to me? -Could you ask? -Ask them yourself. They don't want anything to do with me? Listen, you're an adult. So are they. "One with cheese and one with ham." "Thanks." "I'm sure you'll do great. Call me later." "I will." She fixes his tie and pecks him on the cheek. "Have a good day." He leaves, then comes back. He takes off his shoes. "Are you all right?" "I hate this tie, this suit, and this job. I hate all of it!" "What are you talking about?" "It makes me sick just to look at myself." "Honey, you look great. You'll be late for work." "Please help me." -Now, it's 25 years later. -Yes. So how old are we? -Almost forty. -Forty? More or less. When he says "Help me," he means it. He doesn't know what to do. Or how to cope with his problem. All he knows is that he can't live like this anymore. CHECKROOM -How is your hormone therapy going? -Fine, just fine. -All according to plan? -Yes. How often do you apply the patches to your skin? -Twice a week. -As we agreed. -And you're also taking... -Estrogens and blockers. Excellent. And your court case is about to close. At last! You will finally feel... When it comes to sex change proceedings, the whole medical procedure, the hormones, the preparations for surgery... All that is important, yes. But in reality, you don't really feel comfortable, so to speak, with your new identity, until you have the right papers. The right ID in your case. Now let's focus on preparations for the main surgery. SRS. Sex Reassignment Surgery. Have we discussed your Adam's apple surgery? I'll do it in a separate procedure, after SRS. I'll finally be able to look at myself in the mirror naked and not feel disgusted by my own body. There are men and women. There's male and female. The world doesn't really allow any third options. If you have any doubts about whether you fit this division, too bad for you. You are an outcast. -You are seen as a troublemaker. -Must live up to the stereotype! Yes. You disrupt the divine order, as some people phrase it. Except that these situations have been noted in all cultures, throughout history. Distribution across all human populations has been similar. There's one more thing I wanted to tell you. I recently got a confidence boost. I met someone. I wouldn't say it's a relationship yet, but... I've started seeing a man! "You went through my stuff?" "You say you want to be with me, yet you want to be with men." "That's just a questionnaire." "Who are you lying to, the doctor or me?" -"I need to answer this way." -"Why?" "Because it's normal that a woman wants to be with a man." "If you really loved me, you would continue being a man." "I could become a man for you." "That's impossible." "You said you would always love me." "I do love you. But how can we be together?" "I don't know. Together, just like that." Do you think there's a chance, hypothetical or not, that if he wanted to save his marriage and stay in touch with his family, he might give up his real self, to keep things as they were? To continue being a man, even if his family knows that he really isn't? He has this... There is this feeling... His sense of his true gender identity is very strong. There's no hiding from it in the long run. So in the four scenes we've read, the situation is like this: He is more and more alone. Everybody disappears. There's the conversation with his wife, she's already kind of... There are the children, and we know they shut him out. Then there are his parents, also out of the picture. Are there any new people in his life? He met someone similar. An interesting person. Someone who had the same problem, only in reverse. A woman who wanted to be a man. She helped him. She started helping him. Here you are. Wait, this will be even better. Let's spice it up a little. Look what we have here. Now it will be nice and spicy. You haven't come to visit me in a while. Let's do something about that. Once you start your internship, I'll visit more often. How's that? Weekdays, too. Depending on my schedule. I have the court verdict here. Finally! I noticed that you've changed since you got it. Sure, it gave me an enormous boost. You are somehow different. -More self-confident. -I know! More dominating. Sometimes you get angry with me. And I get it. We have become very close, as friends. And... So when the time comes that one of us meets someone, either you or me, it could be hard for the other person. Feeling like "She doesn't need me anymore." Women should stick together. -You know why? -Why? Because they are on the same wavelength. Women understand one another. People judge me. They take me for a weird dude. But do you think I have a man's brain or a woman's? A woman's. Definitely. Exactly, we're on the same wavelength. We can watch TV together, or watch a rom-com. We can gossip. We can even have a catfight. You helped me out when you didn't even know me. When I was homeless, remember how I would come to your place? You let me crash on your couch, take a shower, just relax. Like a normal person. You and two or three other friends really helped me through this. To be honest, if it wasn't for your friends from work, I'm not sure if I would have helped you. Thanks to them, I knew that you were a normal person. That I wouldn't hurt you or rob you? Like some weirdo? That you are a sane person, with a job. If you didn't have any friends... So it's good that you met them! Yes. They helped me realize you are a good person to have as a friend. Get in and turn the key. Done! Good. Now start in second gear! Well? -Thanks! -Bye! Shit, the engine choked! Is it broken? I don't know why it choked. Just like that? It just died. Out of the blue! Why on earth! In the middle of the road like that! All right. -Did you fix it? -I don't know. The starter's broken, too! Thirty-two, permission to leave the garage. Thirty-two: you are clear to go. What does he do for a living? He's a railway man. He chose this job because he always loved trains. Then he became a Traffic Controller. That's the person in charge of train traffic safety devices. There aren't too many people capable of doing this job, right? It sounds like a really rare profession. In a way, you're responsible for people's safety. So when he gets this present from his work mates, they're not just making fun of him? It's actually a gift? The stuff was in fact second-hand. Used. "A present from my colleagues." "Can't you see they are making fun of you?" "That's not true. To them, I am Marianna." "Is that why they gave you their wives' old lipsticks?" "They're as good as new." "Can't you wait until after Ewelina's wedding?" "Then there will be a baptism. Or other family gatherings. "There's always something." "What if we went to the seaside? You could dress up." "It's not about dressing up." "Then what is it about?" I'll hold this. One second. Like a glove! I don't want them to spill over. No, it's your size. The C-cup is bigger. Don't wear it over your other bra. You need to try it without your top. Don't wear it over your other bra. But this one is bigger. No. It's exactly the same. It's just over the other one. -It's too big. -A nightgown should be loose. I don't like when they're this bulky. It's not too big, really. Does this come in any other color? I have it here, in grey and blue, or peach and red. -That's a great color. -Could I see that one, please? It's for the hospital, so, you know... I don't want them to think I look too flashy. How about one of these? All right, I'll take both. MEDICAL UNIVERSITY OF GDANSK The surgery we scheduled for tomorrow, it's irreversible. -You need to be aware of this. -I am fully aware. We will surgically remove your testicles and penis and shape the female genitals. This procedure is absolutely irreversible. I'm happy to hear that. It's good that you're so determined. We used to shape the vagina using a piece of the intestine. Nowadays we make it using skin from the penis. We will try to make your vagina look as authentic as possible. I need you to sign the "informed consent" form. The procedure is called "neovaginoplasty." "I have been informed that the procedure is irreversible "and I am aware of the consequences." -Do I sign here? -And write today's date. I'm on my way. Hi. Hey... So? Tell me about it! How did it go? I had the surgery yesterday. And guess what? I have a pussy now! Oh, God... -Have you seen it yet? -Not yet. I'll see it today when they change my bandages. When I woke up yesterday, I had the dressings on already. But I feel that... that "thing" is no longer down there. I can't feel it. There's more room! Now I have what you have! It's awesome. I feel my body is really my own. It feels like I was born again. Yeah. You know how great that is? I'm telling you... It's absolute bliss. The things they come up with! -It doesn't really look like a... -But it gets the job done. Look how expensive it is! If I found one on the street I wouldn't know what it is. It's for you know. It's really soft to the touch. And you can use both sides. It helps stretch the skin. But I'm going to buy something else. Because I never have any time to exercise with this. I'm just too sleepy at night, when I need to exercise. I'm gonna buy a plug like this. You just stick it in, and you can walk around with it. Women walk around with these plugs? Don't know. But I need to stretch it out. You know... Maybe it's time to try the old-fashioned way? You could get together with Andrzej. For now, the doctor told me it's a no go. Maybe you should try. Whatever. Look at this! You're going to university? I'll be a student! Check out my schedule. Are you happy to go back to school? Sure. Are you? -About your studies? -Are you rooting for me? You'll no longer feel inferior, that's for sure. Look. -Tell me, how do I look? -Really nice. If you passed me in the street, would you think I'm a weirdo? Or just a normal, tall lady? Be honest. You look normal. Calm down. Just calm down. Let's lie down. That's enough. Lie down! What did you write? "I fear the night." I'm going home now. I'll be back tomorrow. Can you hear me? OK, great. Now say: "Good night!" Say: "Good night!" "Good night!" Or say: "Bye-bye!" "Bye-bye!" Come on, say "Bye-bye!" You can do it! Say: "Bye-bye!" I'm listening. Say: "Bye-bye!" -What kind of disease was it? -He had a stroke. By then, he was taking more hormones than prescribed. That could have caused his illness. He was lucky to pull through. And now... Maybe he'll recover in a while. He would like to have his life back again. I don't want... this situation and this disease to make me lose my faith. -I'm so scared. -Don't be. I've believed in God my whole life. But now I'm about to break. You can't. I'm wondering, has God forgotten me? No one has forgotten you. Everything is fine. -"Happy New Year!" -"Did you have fun?" "It was great." "Everyone told me I have killer legs. And great hair. "I danced all night." "I'm glad you had a good time." "It was the best New Year's Eve in my whole life." "Then you'll have to choose "who you want to spend the next one with." Tell me, who was the first to say: "We can't go on like this." He did. So they split up. And what happens then? He moves out, right? You said he went to live with his parents? -Yes. -So at that point, they... They break off all contact. -He moves in with his parents? -Yes. And that's when the conflict begins. They try to force him to keep his masculinity. How long does he put up with it? A month, maybe six weeks. He just couldn't stand it anymore. So one day he came home from work. He took all his bags which were already packed. He got into his car and drove away. He parked in a random parking lot and went to sleep in his car. I had my whole future planned! I enrolled in university... Yes, you told me. And this stroke got me back to square one. But yesterday you told me that you might go back to school? I'd like to try. But I don't know if I'll be able to. After a stroke, 75% of success is about physical rehabilitation. I've told you this before. After all this, I feel so low right now. Hello, I have one more request. It's about Marianna Klapczynska, you remember her? -A woman, age 47. -Oh, sure. -Can we get her into physiotherapy? -ASAP? -The doctor has to sign it? -Yes. Everything is fine. We're sorting out your physiotherapy. And we will see what happens. You might have a more demanding exercise regime. -I hope that... -Yes? I hope that all this... you know the stroke... will make my parents' anger towards me go away. I'd like to make peace with my Mom. So that she would... -Accept you? -Yeah. -Hello? -Hi, Mom. How are you? I worry about what's going to happen to me. Don't worry, we'll see. We'll figure it out. It's all in God's hands. We are praying for you and you should pray, too. You know what? Why don't you come for a visit? -Well... -When can you come? What about Kasia? Wojtek, have you talked to her? Don't call me Wojtek. I'm a woman. What did she say? I've asked you again and again not to call me Wojtek. It is... a male name. You still don't treat me as a woman. So he's living in his car? In the back seat. For how long? About three months. -What time of year was it? -Winter. And spring came early. How do his children take it? Does he know how they feel about it? From then on, they are ashamed of him. Open wide. One more time. Wide. One more time. Start with "A." One more time. Snake. Toad. Pigeon. Sheep. Clock. Scissors. Wooden spoon. In a shell like this... -What is it? -You tell me. You can cut it into slices. A hazelnut? No. -It's bread. -Right! -Is your foot on the ground? -Yes. -Now shift your balance. -All right. Yes. And stand up. -Hold on! -I am holding on. -Everything OK? -Yes. Now sit down. Lower, lower. Slowly! My foot got caught. I can't do this. My foot is sore. And my toes. I don't feel too stable. Now take one step. -I'm standing! -OK, don't twist. -"Is this where you live?" -"Where should I live?" "You have a decent salary. Why don't you rent a place?" "I'm saving up for my surgery." "How are the girls?" "Fine." "And the wedding?" Everything is ready. Ewelina is very happy. "I'm sure she'll have a gorgeous dress." "Will you come back with me?" "I wish I could." Did she actually ask him to come back? Yes. But he didn't want to... He couldn't bring himself to do it. It would... It would mean admitting failure. It would mean that all he ever said was a lie. It would look like a passing whim. Do you remember our birthday cakes? Every year. What about candles? Candles? How old are you? A little oldish. Exactly. I don't have enough candles. On my birthday, I said: "No more candles!" Kiwi. Don't you remember my cakes, baby doll? Remember how I made them? I was always in such a rush. These days I make them using store-bought sponge cake. Store-bought? -What? -Like ladyfingers? It's good. How do you make it? You don't remember? It takes two to tango. We always did things together. You were the bricklayer, and I was the one handing you the bricks. Remember when we were fixing the roof in winter? Remember how I said I'd drop you, when you were held up by that rope? -And do you remember... -How I caught you? When I was hammering the planks in the... I remember. Your blood is still on that wall. -Really? -We painted over it. I hit myself with the hammer! Remember how you slipped and landed in my arms? That was funny. But listen, let's not dig up the past. You know what, Kasia? Let's be honest with each other. Do you have any regrets about your life? Sure I do. Believe me, I would have found myself a different man. A "real" man, if you say you were a "woman". And we would be together not for 25 years, but forever. She will always be in my heart. Probably forever. I can't just erase that. We went through so much together. We shared all our troubles. -Come on. -It hurts! -Hurts? -Yes, my hip. I know, but what can we do? We're a long way away from you being in shape again. Thank you, honey. You are so helpful. Lean on your crutch. You should sit in your wheelchair. Take a short break. We'll see. Just a little more. All right. And now the doorstep. Oh, God! My favorite shoes! Yeah, yeah It's great to be here Yeah, yeah Set yourself free Yeah, yeah It's great to be here Yeah, yeah Let the party begin Goodness gracious! This is torture. I'm sorry, Andrzej. You'll have to give me a back massage. Sure I will. Promise. -Are these dog-roses? -Look, it has fruits! The ones on the beach are even more red. Can you use it to make rose hip tea? The fruits should be more ripe. She invited me to come to the seaside. She said I'd be able to relax, lie on the beach. And now I have to push her up these bloody dunes! As payback, I'll take her to the mountains next year. No wheelchair! She has a whole year to prepare.
