Welcome to Venice, the most beautiful city on earth. Her trading empire built from the marshes. A maze of canals carved from a lagoon. Water is the lifeblood of Venice. But has the potential to destroy it. There is a fragile equilibrium between Venetians and water. Especially for those who work closest to Venice's lagoon. Venice has always flooded. HE SPEAKS ITALIAN But the ferocity and frequency of floods is a new phenomenon. The Venetians must find a solution... ..or risk losing their city to the deep. The world is in the grip of a global pandemic. And Venice is closed for business. No tourists, no cruise liners. The city is silent. Returned to its title, Serenissima. "The Serene". But the pandemic has given some Venetians a once in a lifetime opportunity. The space and time to restore and prepare the city before the next floods arrive. Across the city, engineers, scientists and restorers are all working towards one goal, to save Venice from the upcoming floods. And this will be the first year that Venice's colossal new flood defence will be tested. But to understand how and if the flood waters can ever be tamed, you must first understand the genesis of this remarkable city over 1,600 years ago. 10km outside of the city is the marshland where Venice first began. Venice was born in the lagoon because the lagoon was useful to Venice. So, Venetians shaped the lagoon the way they wanted. Environmental researcher Alberto Barausse studies this area. It's hardly changed since the arrival of the first settlers. This is actually the kind of landscape they saw back then. So, very low lying land, marshes, some islands, but, in general, very wet, swampy soil, such as this one. I just want to show you how soft this mud is by trying and walk here. I'm not that heavyweight. I weigh 65 kilos, but I'm sinking like this. If this mud can't even support a man, how does it support some of the most iconic buildings on the planet? The secret is very simple. The idea is to do a little experiment. When you plant many poles, they compact the mud between them. The water is pushed out, and the compaction of the mud itself make the mud more capable of supporting weight. Excavations under Venice show they use this system across the city. On top of the wood poles, they placed wooden planks. And then they were ready to build. You see, I'm lightweight. More than him. He can also try. OK, you see Omar is not sinking because of the effect of the poles that compacts the mud between them. So it changes from more I would say fluid-like to more solid-like. And the proof of this is when we put the plank over there and do the same thing on the mud without the poles underneath. You see, there's a difference. Using this system, a cluster of mud islands in the centre of the lagoon grew into an empire. Venice is standing on mud. It was built on mud, and it will stand for many, many years onwards. If the whole of the city is built on wood submerged in water, how long can the foundations of Venice last? Wood is not a long lasting material. It's not durable. And when the conditions are good for rot, it can attack and destroy wood in a few years. Nicola has been investigating the risk that Venice's fragile buildings will collapse. He is studying one of the most iconic structures in the city, the Rialto Bridge. Using long drills, Nicola's team took cores of the wooden piles. And with radiocarbon dating, he made a surprising discovery. Some of the poles of the cores were of the same age of the bridge, around the end of the 16th century. But the cores taken from the Riva del Vin, on the other side of the bridge, were dated around the year 1000. Nicola wants to know how pieces of wood over 1,000 years old can support the Rialto Bridge. Back in his lab, he studies the cell structure. This is a cross-section from the foundation from the year 1000. And we can see that the aspect of the cell walls of all the fibres is grainy. The shape of the fibres is still visible. That demonstrates that this part of the foundation is still in good state of conservation. Over 1,000 years, bacteria should have destroyed the wood. But something has protected the piles. It was fixed in depth in the mud, and there was no source of oxygen. And so there is not the availability of oxygen for the bacteria to accelerate, to speed up the decay. The mud cuts off the supply of oxygen to the bacteria that digest the wood. Water then leaks into the cells and inflates them, holding the structure of the wood. The pressure of water is maintaining each fibre. The foundation of Venice is not only made of wood. It is a system made of three materials - wood, mud and water. This system gives Venice's foundations remarkable longevity. I can say that I will not see the Rialto Bridge collapse in my life, probably even my grandson, if I will have. Venice sits on solid foundations. But building so close to water is precarious, particularly as sea levels are rising. Clues that this has been happening for hundreds of years are hidden in the work of Venice's greatest artist. This is a painting by Canaletto who made several views of Venice, and they were very accurate. In this painting, you see how was Venice three centuries ago. Canaletto used to trace the scene first on a screen using a primitive kind of camera, the camera obscura. This allowed him to achieve unparalleled accuracy in his paintings. The camera obscura is a camera in which there is a reflection of an image, like a modern camera, and they draw the contour lines and had a precise shape of the building. Thanks to Canaletto's precision, Dario can study a detail that is normally overlooked. The algae level. The algae live in the belt where there is a daily wetting and the sunshine. By comparing the black line in the paintings with its current position on the wall, Dario can measure how water levels have changed since 1730. Today, the level of the algae is here. At the Canaletto time, the algae are in this position, three or four rows of stones below this white row. So the algae level has moved by 80 centimetres since then. This painting was made around 1730, so that, in three century, we had this change in the sea level. And we have tested all the Canaletto paintings, and all have changed the same amount, within 10%. But Dario was able to go even further back in time. This building was built at the end of the 15th century. And now you see that the stair is going under water. This is not a design flaw. Originally, the lowest step would have been above water at high tide. These green steps cannot be used because who walks on these steps arrives to the bottom of the canal and not on the boat. Measuring the distance between the last step and today's algae line, Dario can estimate how much the water has risen. Seven. Eight. Eight steps are underwater. He has tested buildings around the city, and they all show the same result. We measured 82 buildings, and we found that, from the 14th century, the sea level rose by one metre and 30 centimetres. It's a lot. Venice's unique location enabled it to prosper into a seafaring empire. But it also made the city vulnerable to environmental changes. At its height, Venice is the most powerful state in the whole Mediterranean. But when you study the history of the city, you see that they're also at the mercy of the waters that they're surrounded by. Marin Sanudo is a Venetian nobleman who, for about the first three decades of the 16th century, kept an almost daily diary of all kinds of things that were happening in the city. So he's a kind of gold mine for Venetian historians. On November 16th, 1517, he wrote about an event in the city's central square, Piazza San Marco. He writes that, on Monday morning, as it had rained a lot, both during the night and in the morning, the water rose very much, so much so that St Mark's Square from the Grand Canal to the Rialto and all the streets were full of water. It was neither possible to travel, nor by land nor with boats. And it was terrible to see the water which also continued to rise, so much so that nobody remembers anything similar. It destroyed many goods in the shops and in many poor houses, on the ground floor, it flooded all they had, causing them great hardship. I wish to leave this event to posterity. It's an extraordinary passage to read now because it's very evocative of what it's like to be in the city when there's an acqua alta, when there's a high water. It's really the first time he writes about one of these great floods in the city, and he's really struck by it as something that hasn't happened before. But as the years go on, he writes about these kind of floods happening more and more often. For hundreds of years, floods have swept through the city, becoming more frequent and severe as the sea level rises. Today, floods pose a deadly threat to the Venetians' livelihoods and risk wiping out even the city's most revered profession. Fabiano Amadi is one of the last glass makers in Venice. But Fabiano's way of life was almost destroyed during the great flood of November 2019. Fabiano was not alone. The 2019 aqua alta caused 870 million euros of damage. And images of the devastation were shared around the globe. The world is focusing on the very visible effect of flooding. But there is another problem hidden from sight, something that is eating away at the very fabric of the city. Elisabetta Zendri and her team are monitoring the concentration of salt in Venice's walls. Venice is known as the city of canals, and it means that all the historical buildings are in direct contact with sea water. All the building materials are porous and sea water rises up the walls. But this is not only water, this is salty water. And when the water evaporates from the walls, the salt can crystallise into the pores. The crystallisation pressure causes cracks of the pores. And this is the final consequence. We have powdering of the materials, detachment of fragments, and all the facade is compromised. This problem is present in all the buildings in the city. Along the canali, along the streets, the buildings are subjected to this phenomenon. Salt is the enemy of Venice. So how do you protect the city from the destructive power of salt? Across Venice, teams of workers attempt to remove salt from buildings and statues. It takes over two years to remove the salt from just one staircase. And teams are repeating this process across all of Venice's precious buildings. The biggest restoration project is taking place in the most symbolic building in the city. San Marco is really the most important church of the city. It almost gleams like a kind of jewel box, this building, particularly when you catch it in a certain light. It's really like nothing else in Italy or in Europe. It's so unusual in terms of its architectural and its decorative elements. But the awful truth about San Marco, one of the most famous and one of the most beautiful buildings in Venice, is that it's also at the lowest point in the city. And it's really at the most terrible risk of flooding. And, obviously, this also does really terrible damage to the building. Teams of restorers are dismantling the mosaic floor of the cathedral. Taking each individual piece, removing the salt, and then relaying them. Today, after years of painstaking work, the team is laying the mosaic into position. It's a first small victory for the team, but the task of renovating this mosaic floor will outlive everybody in this room. This workshop has been operating for 200 years, and will continue until a solution is found to stop the floods. But there may be a way to stop the water. A design so bold and ambitious... ..it's taken over 20 years to build. The scale of the project is immense. 78 colossal gates are arranged in four barriers across the inlets to the lagoon. At Chioggia, Malamocco... ..and two barriers at Lido. All are controlled from a small man-made island. When a storm is coming, the engineers trigger the gates to rise up from the seabed. Each is the size of two tennis courts. This design makes the MOSE revolutionary. Most flood barriers are always visible. But when the threat of flood has passed, the MOSE sinks out of sight. The MOSE is now in its final testing stage. With the flooding season approaching, the team is getting ready to deploy the barriers. As the Covid restrictions are gradually lifting and the city prepares to welcome back tourists, Venice needs the MOSE to work. This huge feat of engineering takes time to be fully operational. So it's vital they accurately predict when the floods will arrive days in advance. Venice is a special city. We have to protect it because otherwise generations will lose their history. Georg has spent a lifetime studying the weather around Venice. He conducts his work on a meteorological platform out in the Adriatic Sea. We go out 15km. There is this oceanographic platform where we do all the measurements that can be used in forecasting. It's a very lonely environment. You don't have telephone. You don't have internet. It's just out of the world. I like to go out there. It's very beautiful. He studies the exact conditions that will cause the city to flood. And the analysis of past floods reveal they are caused by a specific storm system. When you have a low pressure system, then you always have the wind circulation which is anti-clockwise. The closer you get to the low pressure system, the stronger the winds are. And so, once this is moving now closer to Italy, the winds also in the Adriatic Sea get stronger and stronger. Basically, they push the water against the northern part, and they push the water against the lagoon. Then you have also the atmospheric pressure. If you have lower pressure, the water rises up. When you combine high winds, high tide and low atmospheric pressure, it's a recipe for disaster. If this happens on top of the astronomical tide, then we get extremely high contribution. Then you have the atmospheric pressure, you have the winds, you have the tides, and, if you add up everything, then you get these exceptional high water events. Exceptional high tides in Venice are classified as water level higher than 140 centimetres. We saw in the last 150 years 18 events. In the last three years, we saw seven. So something is changing, clearly. And the only reason why that could be is climate change. Georg's dedication means his forecasts are one of the city's very first lines of defence. At the beginning, I was just doing my numerical models. Now a lot of people rely on this operational forecast. There's a lot of responsibility. It's a burden. It's a burden because, if you make it wrong, people will feel it. Today, Georg has spotted the early signs of danger. This is a forecast we issued the 30th of October. Based on what we have here, we can see that, at a certain point, just before the 2nd of November, we should expect an event. We are sure that something will happen here. It's time to alert the city. Georg predicts that, at 8:45pm, a flood will hit the city that could submerge the lowest lying areas under half a metre of sea water. This will be the first acqua alta of the season. Ciao. Ciao, ciao, ciao. At the MOSE, engineer Davide Sernaglia is in charge of the team that will lift the barriers. We have 70 guys that work together here. And all have to work like an orchestra. We have to check the compressor, valve, the transmission system. It's not possible to lose time. But it's not simple. In the city, workers are preparing in case the MOSE fails to lift. Across Venice, there is a sense of apprehension. The approaching flood is predicted to inundate nearly half the city. Kiosk owner Walter Mutti is anxious. Last time, his whole livelihood disappeared into the lagoon. Back in 2019, after the last big flood hit, his kiosk had to be pulled from the bottom of the canal. Only thanks to the generosity of the locals, Walter was able to restore his newsstand and start again. A crowdfunding appeal raised 25,000 euros to pay for the restoration of his kiosk. But Walter knows that another flood, like the one expected today, could spell financial ruin. To protect the city and its people, Davide and his team need to raise all the gates before the surge tide arrives. But there is bad news. The wind has changed direction, pushing the storm towards Venice and causing the tide to rise far faster than expected. Davide orders the immediate lifting of Treporti, the northernmost set of gates. With all the Treporti gates safely deployed, Davide orders the lifting of the other barriers. But two of the San Nicolo gates aren't rising. Each gate has safety valves to prevent it accidentally rising up. They have to be open to allow air into the gate, otherwise it won't lift. Davide suspects that the safety valves haven't opened on these two gates, and they can't rise into position. And the storm is inching closer and closer. Davide decides his only option is to risk rebooting the system. The lowest parts of Venice had been forecast to be submerged under damaging sea water. But the only water in Piazza San Marco is from the rain. The MOSE has passed its test, and the people of Venice are safe. The following morning, the mood in the city is positive. HE HUMS TUNE Just 36 hours later, Walter is proved right. Piazza San Marco is flooding. Corrosive sea water is bubbling up through the drains... ..and pouring into the basilica. Inside, sea water is coming up through the floor. The reason is because the MOSE hasn't been deployed. This is not because of mechanical failure. The barriers are only raised for extreme high water, storm surges that will flood at least 46% of the city. But smaller acqua alta can still inundate the lowest-lying parts of the city, like the historic Piazza San Marco. Why has this jewel of Venice been left to the mercy of saltwater? Giovanni Cecconi is one of the scientists who have made it their mission to save this city. He studied the lagoon for over 40 years, including 20 years working on the MOSE. He knows that raising the flood barriers too often will threaten the city and its people. If we stop the tide, if we use the MOSE too much, then the lagoon will die. A healthy lagoon make the Venice city healthier. And the secret of a healthy lagoon is the tide. Twice a day, we have a cycle of inflow and outflow. Because of the tide, this water is mixed. If you don't have the stirring, the same old water will get more and more polluted. This water will lack oxygen, and then there will be a die-off. All the fish will disappear, you will have a bad smell. Venetians rely on the lagoon's tides for one of the most basic pieces of the city's infrastructure. In Venice, you don't have a septic sewage system. So the waste is discharged into the inner canal. Because of a lack of space in the city, there aren't enough septic tanks to collect all of Venice's sewage. When the MOSE is closed, there is no tide, and human waste starts accumulating. It is very important that the sewage system is flushed by the tide. Because without the tide, Venice will die in its own waste. Shutting the inlets too frequently could jeopardise the health of the city's population. If the MOSE can't fully protect the historic heart of Venice, scientists need to find other solutions. One answer lies in understanding how the water enters the piazza. Underneath the piazza is an old drainage system for rainwater. It connects directly to the canals. So when the tide rises, water floods back into the piazza. The authorities plan to insert valves to stop this from happening. But that is not enough. Waves can still jump over the quayside and reach the square. Scientists Luca Martinelli and Piero Ruol are studying ways of preventing this from happening. The image of having a device like the MOSE, that is in operation and still having San Marcos Square flooded, is something that is not so nice. This volume of water entering San Marco is really very high, and it is difficult to think of a solution, of a drainage system that is collecting all this water and pump it outside. To solve the problem, Piero and Luca have built a scale model of the San Marco quayside in their laboratory, and then recreated the exact conditions that caused the water to crash over the top. What you see here are waves that are generated by our paddle. We have a flume that is 36 metres long and it simulates the wave that propagates towards the quay. This is not a wave coming from the sea. This is a wave generated inside the lagoon. And these waves are not so big, maybe 30 or 40 centimetres, not more than that. The team use this experimental set-up to investigate ways of blocking waves. They have found one simple system works the best. One way to mitigate the load produced by the waves is to create a barrier. And we will see what happens to the wave. The barrier absorbs some of the energy of the incoming wave. The wave that heads towards San Marco now isn't powerful enough to jump over the quayside. The idea of using a floating device that is attenuating so efficiently the wave, because if you come again, now you don't see... Almost no wave is passing over the limit of the pavement. So the idea is correct, and this is the way we suggested to approach the problem. Because without this device, the flooding is too high. Many scientists are focusing on the immediate risk of flooding. But over the next century, sea levels are expected to rise dramatically. This will be catastrophic for the city and will make many current solutions obsolete... ..including the mighty MOSE. The MOSE cannot last forever. So now we have really to start doing something else. Pietro, an engineer, believes we need a more radical idea. He dreams of raising the whole city. The idea is by injecting sea water into deep aquifers or deep reservoir below the lagoon bottom, to try to uplift the city of Venice around 25 centimetres. This is something that can really be done, and in practice it works. Beneath Venice's lagoon are deep aquifers, full of highly absorbent sand, that act like a sponge. Injecting sea water directly into these aquifers will cause them to swell and push up on the layers above. This will cause the whole of Venice to lift up. It's a very ambitious plan, but it is a proven technology. We know that this can be done because there are other sites all over the world where fluid is injected and the land uplifted. In the 1930s, oil was pumped from the Wilmington Oil Fields in California in such vast quantities that the land began to subside. In some places the ground had sunk nine metres. The authorities began injecting sea water under the ground, which lifted the land back to its previous levels. The idea is, let's put ten wells around Venice, cantered on the Bridge of Rialto. We inject different amounts of water into each well. And we adjust the pumping rate in order to have, as uniform as possible, uplifting of the city, but without generating any kind of cracks or fracture. We reach this maximum uplift of about 20, 25 centimetres in ten years. Raising Venice would greatly decrease the impact of high tides and the rising sea level in the city. Venice cannot be saved in one way only. Several ideas must work together in order to maintain the city is safe with respect to high tide. Bold engineering could provide part of the solution. But some scientists believe they should look to nature and the lagoon. Within the lagoon is a mosaic of salt marshes... ..a natural flood barrier to block the waves. And unlike man-made defences, they will never become redundant. Because as the water rises, the marshes grow. The lagoon is a system that keep pace with sea level rise. The more the water is rising, the more the salt marsh are compensating. Because of the salt marsh, they are fitted to survive. They are very tenacious because if they do not succeed, they will disappear. These two plants are cooperating to keep the soil higher. The roots are very important because they hold the soil together. At the same time, they push the plant a little higher. This is the first mechanism of counteracting sea-level rise, producing more volume below. The plants form a thick carpet of vegetation, which traps mud and debris brought in by the water. The more it is flooded, the more it grows. Each year, it is growing now more than one or two centimetre. The lagoon is not a dead system that is frozen, but is an evolutionary stage, continuously. Constant evolution can allow an ecosystem to survive. But when humans mismanage nature, there can be dire consequences. Here in the lagoon, a small foreign sea creature is threatening the future of the natural flood barriers. This is a 3.5km-long bridge... ..and it is clogged by oyster. It come from the United States, one century ago, with the ballast of the ships, and it can grow very rapidly. Now we have two metre of oyster like this. The problem is not just in one arch. Across the three bridges, there are 223 arches, and all of them have an oyster infestation. This is blocking the water circulation in the lagoon, and stagnation is threatening the entire ecosystem. It is damming the tide. When they grow too much, they stop the flow and then they die. So it is a cycle. In the shadow of this structure, 100 square km of lagoon is in deficit of oxygen. And when there is a lack of oxygen, there is a die-off of the vegetation that sustains the ecosystem in Venice. This is very, very unusual because it's nature that is causing problem to the human. But the human contributed because of lack of maintenance and control and monitoring. The maintenance of the lagoon is very important. This is not the first time Venetians have contributed to problems in the lagoon. Vast engineering projects from centuries ago have left an unwelcome legacy. This is Jacopo de' Barbari's map of Venice, which was made in the year 1500. And it shows the entire city in incredible detail. Venice in 1500 is at the height of its power and wealth and size. We can see all of these ships at what was then really a bustling port - ships coming from all over the Mediterranean and Europe. By the beginning of the 16th century, Venice is controlling vast swathes of the Mediterranean. And the driving force of the city's dominance was an area called the Arsenale. If we look around now, it's a really quiet, kind of serene place. But the Arsenale was the Venetian shipyard. So this is really the kind of the engine room of Venetian power here, because this is where they produced all of the ships that they used for war and for trade. By the 16th century, this is the biggest industrial complex in Europe. There are thousands of workers coming in here every day to work on these ships. But the lagoon was undergoing a dramatic change. Sediments brought in by the rivers had accumulated over centuries... ..and now the canals were silting up. It actually became more difficult for them to navigate through the lagoon, so they had to come up with solutions like dredging the soft mud out of the bottom of the canals, and also divert some of the rivers. Access to water was their source of power. So the Venetians embarked on a massive engineering project to reshape the environment and keep the lagoon from turning into dry land. It was backbreaking labour to dredge out these channels. Really hard work and constant effort of maintenance so that they could actually keep these ships moving, keep the trade flowing, keep people coming in and out, and also sending galleys off to war when they needed to. Altering the lagoon came at a cost, because it created new problems in turn, because it allowed more sea water to come into the lagoon. And that meant that flooding in the centre became more and more of a problem. Venetians modified the lagoon to grow their influence as a commercial sea power. But by the turn of the century, the map of international trade was already being redrawn. New routes towards the Americas and stronger competition within the Mediterranean spelled doom for Venice's sea-faring economy. To survive, the city had to reinvent itself. Venice has been, for centuries, a place where people were drawn to it as a kind of magnet. People used to come to Venice in the early periods as traders or as pilgrims, even as refugees or migrants to work. Increasingly, they come, really, to see the city itself, but also to experience spectacle and leisure. Exploiting its appeal to foreign visitors, Venice transformed itself into a Mecca of entertainment. The travellers who come to Venice increasingly are not only drawn by the desire to see the city and to experience its culture, but also by the promise of illicit pleasures that they might find. We have the casinos... ..gambling. High-class courtesans as well, and some of the most famous brothels in Europe. The city built on water became an essential travel destination for nobles and artists from across Europe. If you'd visited these coffee houses around the city in the 18th or 19th century, you might have seen Rousseau in one corner discussing philosophy, or at another point Balzac, Dickens. Venice's identity is really changing. Tourism has become absolutely the main industry. By the 20th century, Venice wasn't just enjoyed by the wealthy elite. With the advent of mass tourism, the number of visitors boomed. And today, millions come here every year. But this popularity comes at a price. FOGHORN BLARES In recent years, the size and number of cruise ships have been increasing. And in 2019, a liner ploughed into a dock. HORN BLARES SHOUTING Miraculously, there were no fatalities... ..but there were growing protests against these ships sailing through the very centre of Venice. In 2021, the authorities banned these colossal vessels from the city. But has this decision made flooding even more likely? Cruise ships are now banished to a narrow channel west of Venice. Far from being an unused stretch of the lagoon, this was already a busy location. Oceanographer Luca Zaggia is worried cruise liners are only going to place more stress on a natural system already in peril. This navigation channel was built at the end of the '60s and goes to the...to the industrial port, which is over there. This channel links the sea to Porto Marghera, one of the busiest ports in Italy, dealing in nearly 25 million tonnes of cargo every year. So, starting from the '60s, they doubled the sites. Today we have ships as long as 300 metres, which is quite a lot for this channel. The same length as six Olympic-size swimming pools. And when it comes to ships, size matters. This is a big wake. Well, that was not bad. So now on the side, you see the water bounces back and forth for about 15, 20 minutes. And the erosion created by the ships, it's undercutting the shore. And we lost here essentially 150 metres since the construction of the canal. The larger the ship and the quicker it's moving, the bigger the waves it produces. Large ships generate two different destructive waves. First, a depression wave that sucks water towards the vessel. And then a displacement wave generated by the hull, pushing water out of the way as the vessel powers forward. The power of these two waves combine to destroy the land close to the channel. The ship wakes, they arrive until this point, they undercut the cliff, and finally slabs of soil will collapse. This is kind of very fast process. Over a year, you can lose about four metres of shoreline. And on the other side of the channel, the waves from large ships are scouring out mud from the seafloor. Since the 1970s, erosion has caused the lagoon to become over half a metre deeper. And when the lagoon gets deeper, it increases the risk of Venice flooding. This is a buffer between the land and the ocean. We have no idea of how many problems you can have on the coast without this buffer. So we need to limit the erosion if we want to save Venice. Luca thinks Venetians face a stark choice - saving their city or letting cargo on cruise ships inside the lagoon. Nature is paying for a business that is unsustainable, and that's not correct. So we must be correct with the environment because we inherited it from the past and we are in charge of it. And this is what protects Venice from further damages. My opinion is the lagoon is not suitable for large vessels. The natural defence systems that are so important for the survival of Venice are failing to cope with the increase of water traffic. And the effects of this increase are not limited to the outer lagoon. Today, Venice's waterways are teeming with small motorboats. Similarly to big ships, they also create damaging breaks. And these are slowly eroding the walls of the canals. But the city's services are heavily dependent on motorboats. So how can Venice escape wake pollution? A startup from Sweden believes they have the answer. OK, so now we're going at five knots, 8km an hour, and this boat is just like a regular boat at this speed. When going through the water, that water has to go somewhere and it creates a wake behind the boat. That wave is dangerous to the structures here in Venice. But if I start to push the throttle forward, we start to gain speed... ..and as soon as we... ..hit 60 knots... ..you'll notice that this boat starts flying. Instead of punching through the waves and displacing a lot of water, we use a technology called hydrofoil. When the hydrofoil, or wing, is moving through the water, water on the top side travels faster than on the underside, and this different pressure lifts the whole wake up. To make it all possible, complex software constantly adjusts the foil's position. The boat is stabilised by computer power, so the foil moves 100 times per second to account for waves and side winds and people moving about on the boat. We're doing 20 knots and there's no spray and there's no noises at all. We're just flying quietly above the surface. And as you see behind us, there's no wake at all. Halving the friction with the water allows the boat to consume much less energy. For Venice's wider waterways, regularly travelled by speeding taxi boats and ferries, Mikael thinks this technology could drastically cut down wake pollution in the city. HORN HONKS But some believe that to address its present problems, Venice should also look back to the practices of the past. THEY SPEAK ITALIAN FANFARE Venetian rowing is undergoing a renaissance. And once a year, thousands of devotees get the chance to showcase their skills at the Regata Storica. Since at least the 13th century, boat races have been part of the city's own identity. Today, this is once again a chance to celebrate Venice's history... ..but also to demonstrate how this city could look, free of motorised boats. CHEERING THEY TOAST IN ITALIAN Venice was born out of its environment, grown from the mud of a lagoon into a wonder of the world. Now, 1,600 years later... ..the people of Venice look to adapt the same lagoon to secure the future of their city. HE SPEAKS ITALIAN Faced with rising water... ..the Venetians are turning to revolutionary engineering... ..the natural environment... ..and knowledge from their past. Venice is a great laboratory of adaptation, because it has been able to survive over the centuries, transforming the environment according to its needs.
