Police believe two men and three women became the latest victims of the recent rafts of mysterious kidnappings when they vanished from the parking lot of the Good Sports health club late last night. Bringing the number of disappearances over the last month to a total of 23 14 men and 9 women. As with all previous disappearances the victims were last seen either going to or coming from their usual workout. See you later. - Bye Catch you later. - Bye. In the mean time people are urged to use their gyms only during daylight hours. If you must go at night travel in groups and carry big sticks. Hey, I was watching that. Hi, Kathy. How's it going? Barbara, I thought you quit. When I finally looked so good, no way. I've just been coming in the mornings. I know what you mean. I usually try to get out of here before dark myself. Well, keep it up once you've been at it as long as I have. You'll really look good. Thanks. You're an inspiration. Stop it. Mom, Chris keeps making dinosaur noises at me. - Christine, stop making dinosaurs sounds at the breakfast table, please. - You started it. - Did not. - Did too! - Did not! - Did too! - Did not! - Mrs. Powell's cat put in our yard again. - Yeah, well, he did up here. - Ew, that's a daddy job. - You know, Dad, if we had a dog, he'd keep that cat away. - Yeah, but then I'd be cleaning up a dog poop instead of cat poop. - If Chris gets a dog, I want a mouse, a white one. - Nobody's getting a mouse or a dog, and I'll take care of that cat myself. - Oh, yeah? How are you gonna do that? - Daddy, you wouldn't! - Of course he wouldn't. - Would you honey? - I don't know. - Yeah. What's the body count? - OK, gimme that address. - Here he is! - I understand we have a witness? - Yes, sir. Security guard found her hiding in a locker. - Where is she now? - County Memorial under heavy sedation. - Before I could question her, whose bright idea was that? - Lieutenant Wisnowski. - Shit. What the hell was he doing here? - I don't know. - Is Yamata here yet? - Women's locker room. - Thank you. - How you doing, Trev? - Hey, Sully. What a mess, huh? - Oh, boy. - Hey, Sully, what's happening? - I don't know. You tell me. - We've got one Kathy Carpenter. - Best damn body I've ever seen. - Dead or alive? - I got one. - Purse is in that locker. - Anything in it? - Just the usual compact lipstick, hairbrush. - Condoms. - You're kind of girl. - Why, 'cause she's easy? - No, cause she's dead. - Oh, that's funny. - So what about the others? - Well, my professional medical opinion, they're dead too. - Looks like he used a 22. - Yeah, that would be my guess. All the wounds were small and clean. - And all headshots, right? - Yeah. - You better hope you never have to shoot it out with this guy. I hear he took a few with him. - Yeah, about a half dozen or so. - Jesus Christ. - Well, at least he knows I'm taking him alive. - What the hell is he doing with them? - You're gonna get this guy. He left tracks this time. I don't know, Phil. It's gonna be hard to... You know that guy? - What guy? - What you didn't see him? - No, he's probably one of the guys from uptown. - Yeah, maybe. - First of the month. - Hey, Wyznowski What's the deal with you sending my witness to the hospital before I could even question her? - I tried talking to her. It's a fucking waste of time. Just keeps blubbering. - Uh-huh. Well, next time you should try a more sensitive approach, like, uh, beating her with a rubber hose. - Hello, Phil. Hey Sully, my dog just had puppies. What do you say? - Wear a condom next time. - I thought you just might want one for the kids. - Smart ass. - No, thank you. - Come on, Sully, every kid needs a dog. - What to piss on my carpet and chew on my shoes? - Uh-huh. You just described my date last night. You got to start going out with a better class of a woman, Phil. - All right. Tell your sister I can't see her anymore then. - Can't, we don't talk. - Now Medina says that you haven't send over the bullets to ballistics. - How come? - There aren't any. - What are you talking about? - He must have dug them out before he took off. - Dug them out of the corpses. - Yeah. And they weren't just regular headshots, either. He shot him either in the ear or the eye. - Holy shit. - What? - Well, I had this friend once, Kevin, something and, uh, he used to stuff animals as a hobby, and he'd always had to shoot them in the eyes so there wouldn't be any bullet holes in the hide. You know what I mean? - You think our boys got a trophy room? - Sullivan, Yamada... Wyznowski My office, please. Gentlemen, I just got off the phone with the chief, and my ears are still ringing. So give me some good news. I wish we could captain, but our boy covers his tracks pretty damn well. We don't know dick, except that he's a dead shot, and he's very discriminating about his victims. - Let me have that with you. - Sure. - So, uh, you don't agree, huh? - No, sir, I don't. I got that these guys are generally discriminating, you know, zeroing in on a specific race or gender, but this guy is all over the map. He'll hit men, women, black, white, spics, chinks, - Hey - I mean oriental people, sir. The only constant thing, sir, is where he kills them. And that's in health spas. No, if they're the wrong size, he leaves them behind, neither too heavy or too thin. Our boy wants people in perfect physical condition. So, why did he leave the weightlifter behind? Or that perfect ten in the shower? I don't know, but there is a reason. You bet there's a reason. The reason is you're wrong. Well, you look at this, am I giving this too much water, or..? Maybe there's not enough sunlight. Yamada, what do you think? Well, um, I'm no expert, but have you tried those little fertilizer steaks? Oh, no, no. I mean, what do you think about Sullivan's theory? Oh, I think it makes sense. I mean, I don't know what our boys do with the bodies, but he does want him in perfect condition. You only saying that, because you like him. No, I'm only saying that because I don't like you. You see, sir, that's what I was telling you. These guys are constantly talking about me like that in front of the man of that undermines my authority. The only thing undermining your authority is that suit. And the tie. Well, yeah, the tie goes that same. Oh, right. Look, that's enough, okay? Now, tell me about the witness. You got a statement yet? She's on a sedation and will be unconscious until morning. All right. I want Wisnowski and you to be the first things she sees when she wakes up. And Wisnowski. Try getting a little closer to your razor tomorrow. I should have said there was a memo from my dermatologist about the rash on my face. Yeah, well, you got till the weekend, okay? Now, everybody get out of here, will ya. I'm going to figure out what I'm going to have to say to the press conference tonight. Puppies make great Christmas presents. - Fuck you, Phil. I just wanted to throw that out there. Thanks for your support, guys. Hey, it's a jungle in there. Is it just me or is he fat? Bye, Amy. - Bye! Bye. Yeah, Lieutenant Sullivan. Hey stranger, I'm heading home. Should I keep it warm or are you going to be late again? Keep what warm, honey? Dinner, of course. You're such a tease. Look, I was just about... Honey, I'll call you back. I got to go, OK? Oh, OK. Love you. I love you, too. Hey, Sully. Caught me in the middle of dinner. Christ Phil, how can you eat in here? You've never eaten in the cafeteria. What's up? The weightlifter and the dead woman in the shower. I haven't gotten to them yet. Good, let's check them out. You mind telling me what you're looking for? Scars. Like this one. Appendectomy. Speaking of scars. Did you ever find out what caused that rash on eh, Wisnovski's face? Could be the stress of the case. It either that or he's had his head up his ass so long he finally caught something. No scars. Can I turn her over? Lift up her arm. Oh, yeah. - Implants. Primo piece of work too. Mm-hmm. Must have spend 15 grand. A piece? No. You've got to buy him in pairs like shoes. You're developing a nice pair there, Phil. What is that on your neck? Is that... a hickey? No, it's a birthmark. Mm-hmm. Sure whatever you say, Phil So how'd you know about the scars? A Missing Persons file. All 20 of the original victims had no distinguishing scars. So do we have a taxidermist here? You think he's mounting trophies? No, Phil. I don't know what to think. This is a loss. Hi, baby. Hi, baby. What's up? Ah, just grading papers. Miss Azbel's out with a flu, so I'm handling her third graders for a few days. Christ. 2 a.m. I was waiting up for you. Why what's up? Well, I took the kids to your mother's. Mm-hmm. Everybody okay? Everything's fine. I just took them to your mother's. Is that a fact? Well, I just thought maybe we could have some time alone. You tired? Well, actually, yeah. How tired? Well... tired, tired. Okay. I said I was tired. Not dead. I think I just felt the eh... Earth move. Maybe we should continue this upstairs, huh? Okay, well, you go upstairs and I'll clean this up. You've got to be kidding me. Mrs Brewster. I'm Lieutenant Sullivan, and this is lieutenant Wyznowski. Yeah, we'll be, uh, serial killer task force. But I already told the other officer. I didn't see anything when I heard the gunshot. I hid in my locker. Other officer? The one who was just here? You just missed him. Excuse me! Stay. Stay? What the fuck is that? Out of the way! Out of the way, police! Go away! Get out of the way! Hey! He didn't go that way! Trust me! Hey, Wyznowski you alright? God damn it! Let's go! Best damn jacket! New this week! God damn it! God! You lost him! Great! Ah, come on! Let's put out an APB. I didn't know where you were hiding, but I knew you'd have to come back out. You got him! Is he dead? Well I'd put three rounds through this punk. Yeah well, will generally do it. I thought you said you shot him. Okay, I can't just hear myself, folks. You know, as much as I do. You know weirdo, you starting to get on my nerves. At least tell us where those bodies are so families can give them a proper burial. You better start talking shit face. Or I'm gonna give you a 9-millimeter enema. I don't see a lawyer in there. Has he been Mirandized? Yes, he has. But he hasn't spoken since he came, too. I'm not even sure he speaks English. What is that smell? I'm sorry, sir. I fell into the trash can. Oh, good. Good. I was afraid I was over-fertilizing. Did he have any id on him? No id. He had stun gun, sunglasses, a watch, and a key. Probably to his apartment, wherever that is. What about his fingerprints? You ran them through the FBI? No, Prints. His fingers were smooth. As a baby's butt. What do you mean? He took them off with acid or something. You find that unusual? Take a look at this. Ah, Medina, what's a matter with you, man? The question is, what's the matter with him? You claim this device rendered him unconscious, correct? Yeah. Well, this was modified to only transmit 10 volts, This contraption wouldn't have stun a laboratory rat It's probably why it wouldn't stun you. I know, you gotta check out the jacket. I think it's bulletproof. Why don't you just admit you missed? It's the jacket. It isn't even scorched. Well, perhaps inside. It's chemically treated or... Synthetically woven or something. Yeah, perhaps I'm Miss America. Listen, why don't you take a bath, huh? And let's just see if we can't find out who this guy is before the awards ceremony. Awards ceremony? I'm getting an award. Last night, the city slept a little easier because the alleged health spot killer spent the night behind bars. Lieutenant Mike Sullivan of the serial killer task force, who apprehended the suspect after a harrowing foot chase, was presented with a special commendation. My hero. You talk about me like I'm some kind of Rambo. Lucky me, yeah. Well, if you play your cards, right? You might get lucky again. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. - Yeah? Yeah? Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Yeah? Mm-hmm. OH baby. Tada! What is that? Daddy's a hero! Yeah, so we made you breakfast in bed. Wow, ain't this is great, honey? Yeah, this is great. Uh, thanks, guys. Thanks, guys. Dad? It's for you. Yes? If Superman and Mighty Mouse had a fight, who would win? Yeah, dad, who? Well, I think that's a mommy question. I mean, mommy gets a teacher, right? But she told us to ask you. Really? Superhero falls into daddy questions category. Is that a fact? Mm-hmm. Okay. Well, um, Superman is a person. And Mighty Mouse isn't a person. And people are smarter than animals. Well, lab mice have proven to be very intelligent, sweetheart. Really? They're smart? But they're not as smart as people. So Superman would win then? Absolutely. But Mighty Mouse could fly right up Superman's butt, and rip his heart out. Kathleen Sullivan, you know better than that. He couldn't fly up Superman's butt? No stupid. Superman can just squeeze his ass cheeks together and squish him. You think this is funny? No, no, no. You two, where you get language like that. Ah! Honey look at the time. I've got to go. Mommy, daddy's a hero. Isn't he just like Superman? Oh, yeah, he certainly is. Definitely. But it hasn't been treated with chemicals. Are you sure? Sully, I did my undergraduate studies in the 70s. I know my chemicals. So you're saying this is not real leather? No, no, it, uh, most definitely is real. I just can't seem to place the exact species. It's probably some kind of crocodile. Medina, crocodile is not bulletproof. Sully, if you brought me a dodo skin jacket to examine, for example, I would be able to place it either. Well, wouldn't have anything to actually compare it to. I mean, we know the dodo bird existed. We even know what it looked like, but, um, we don't have an actual specimen. Just a head and a foot at the British Museum in London. So you're telling me this animal is extinct? It's at least an endangered species. It's probably from Africa, most likely from Egypt. What a waste. Don't worry, buddy. Our perpetrator is killing humans now. Sullivan. Morning. Captain. Wyznowski is taking over the task force. Another health spot was hit late last night. Now the press hasn't gotten hold of it yet. But when they do, they're gonna tear Chief Dawes and the Mayor new assholes. Oh, my God. You got the wrong guy. Now we're gonna have to cut him loose so he doesn't sue for false arrest. False arrest? Well, there's nothing to hold him on. What about impersonating a police officer? The witness at the hospital said that she only assumed he was a cop. But he never actually flashed a badge. Well, let's hold him resisting arrest. Wyznowski tells me that you never identified yourself as a cop. Seems like pretty sloppy police work to me. You can't let him go, Captain. He's involved, I know it. I love seeing you on your knees, Sullivan. So does your wife. You. Hey, hey, hey. No yelling. It's bad for morale. There's nothing wrong with my morale. Not yours, the plants. And get the fuck off my wandering Jew. Sullivan, I'm sorry. Hey, do the words earlier retirement mean anything to you. Do the words blow me, mean anything to you? Lieutenant Sullivan! Sully, it's Phil, I got something for you. So what does that look like to you? I don't know. Looks like a tracking beacon. But I never seen one this small. It was on this guy. No, in him. Upper vertebra right here. Wow. Why? Why? I can't even tell you how. I mean, there's not a surgical scar anywhere on this guy. Why would anybody want to track a CPA anyway? I don't know. But I'm going to find out. Wow. The HANGAR gentlemen's club Live NUDE girls Good evening, there's a 20 dollar cover charge... Oh shit! Hi, what'll you have? What is this guy? A vampire? Whoa. Holy shit! 9-1-1 state the nature of your emergency. All units in the vicinity of Mannheim and Foster proceed to the Hangar gentlemen's club, possible sighting of the health nut. This is the Police, throw down your weapon.. This is the Police, throw down your weapon and come out with your hands away from your body. Unit 5 joining pursuit of the health nut. Be advised suspect is turning towards Memorial parkway Move it pal, catch up! Swinging around to cut him off. Damn it, I'm boxed in Can you cut him off, unit 5? Negative, there are too many civilian vehicles Dispatch, where the hell is our backup? Unit 12 and 7 are responding, but their ETA is aproximately 5 minutes Go to flank, cut him off again unit 5 See if you can perform a hit manoevre that forces him to slow down Mother What the fuck? Let's go. Holy shit, is that a gun? There he goes, onto the highway. Get me close enough so I can shoot out his tires. You can't even see his tires. Yes, I can. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. This is wild. That's it. That's it. Now hold steady so I can get a clean shot. Oh, Christ, he's got a fucking Cannon. Faster, he's getting away. I'll do the driving, you do the shooting. Catch up so I can get another shot of his tires. Fuck his tires, kill him. I can't. You can try harder. Remember, I want him alive. Holy shit. I thought you said you couldn't kill that son of a bitch. I can't. Can't? Or wont? Stay. Don't talk to me like your puppy, all right? - Jental! Depos su armoey. - Shoot him! Shoot him!! For Christ sake, shoot him! - Sayonara, son of a bitch. - All clear. - He's already gone. Nobody packs up that fast. - Are you sure this is the right place? - Sullivan, what are you doing? - I'm looking for something. - By Braille? - But there's nothing here, come on. - That fuck bitch - Ah, Yamada, I'm glad you could make it. - Sorry. - Getting through those reporters is like parting the Red Sea. - All right, here's what we have so far. A perp has changed his MO, Probably because every health club in this city is now closing at dusk. And he's left behind every stripper with augmented breasts. - Is there any other kind? - Well, the three left on the cart, we're all natural. Sully says that our original suspect actually helped him pursue the health nut. That he may be a cop from another country, and that the health nut is maybe from the same place. - What are you saying they're both aliens? - Definitely. - From where? Europe? - Europe? - That might explain the exotic leather jacket, but I mean, who manufactured those sophisticated weapons? - Yeah, now, what about those? - I've never seen anything like them before. - All right, I want every hospital in a 200 mile radius checked out. If our boy doesn't get himself some medical attention, he's gonna take care of our problem for us. - Now, Yamada, I want you to take the perp's arm back to the morgue, keep it on ice. - You guys get prints off of it yet? - Has no fingerprints. - Oh, deja vu. - I don't get it. If this guy was a cop, why didn't he tell us when we had him in custody? - Maybe he's under cover. - Well, what have to be a fucking deep cover? - So maybe it's a fucking deep cover, what the hell you want from me. - Well, that one from you was the fucking truth. - The fucking truth! - What are you saying? That I'm holding evidence? - Well, you said it. Not me. - It's because there's too many syllables for you. - You alright, Sully? I need a favor. I need you to do an autopsy on that arm for me. I already know what it died of. Separation anxiety. - I need you to look for anything wrong or unusual about that arm. What's going on? Was Wyznowski right? Are you hiding something? - Okay, I remember that homing beacon we found on the CPA. - Yeah. - What if it's sort of a gaming tag like you put on wild animals to track their migration? - Are you serious? That's all part of that. - No, man. One thing people aren't migratory. - So were you born here? - No, Chicago. But I didn't migrate. I moved. - And you spend the winters in Florida. What do you call that? - Christmas vacation. Listen, if you want me to help you, you gonna have to let me know what's going on. - Okay. This sounds crazy. But I don't think those guys are from another country. I think they're from another planet. Let me guess. Uranus, right? - Phil. The killer was bulletproof. And that Van disappeared right in front of me. It was a dark van on a dimly lit highway and you can't shoot worth a shit. I know the difference between hard to see and invisible. Maybe you should get that head when you look that. Phil, just do the autopsy for me, okay? Please. All right. Thanks. You're gonna think I'm fucking crazy. Honey, what do you know about that woman who did the studies on the apes? Which one? Dian Fossey or Jane Goodall? I don't know. The one who was in the jungle with them. Well, let's see. There was Dian Fossey, who spent 20 years with the mountain gorillas in Rwanda. And then Jane Goodall's been living with the chimpanzees in Tanzania for 30 years. When did you become miss Britannica? Okay, something's bothering you. What is it? You know, I hate when you do that. But let's say you're Jane Goodall. And someone is killing all the chimpanzees. You'd stop him if you could, right? If I could. Would you kill them? No, of course not. Even if it meant saving all the chimps? Look, as much as I love animals, and you know I do, they're still only animals. You know, Dian Fossey had that same problem. Someone was trying to kill all the gorillas? Yeah, I mean, she almost got them until they murdered her. They murdered her! So what you're saying is... The gorillas have to take care of themselves. Right. Lieutenant Sullivan. - Sully it's Carlos from vehicle impound. Carlos, what you got for me? Not much, I'm afraid. That Van is nothing but a burnt-out shell. Nothing weird about it? Like what? High-tech, alien-type shit. It's a Van, Sully Not the space shuttle. Okay, thanks for calling... Carlos. This is a bullet from the suspect's smaller handgun, normal over-under barrel. What was it? Two-five? Actually, it's closer to the caliber to 2.7 and 2.8 Custom jam. Assuredly so. As evidenced by this. What the hell is that? Oh, dear! The closest I can surmise is a, a gyroscope? An electronic homing system of some configuration. Modified to microscopic proportions, of course. But, you know, we all know your college educated, just say it in English. He means it's a mini guided missile? That would be my hypothesis. Based on the data and the physical evidence presented to me. Well, that would explain all the fancy headshots. Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Are you saying that this bullet is capable of chasing people down like a... like a heat-seeking rocket? Precisely. Do you have a better theory? Yeah. You're full of shit. How about that as a theory? Listen to me, Einstein. Have you actually fired this bullet? - Of course not. I figured, under the circumstances, it prudent to more fully examine the bullets in a cable field. Oh, yes. But listen, I may not have a degree from the University of Scientific Smart Asses, but I do know guns. When I point this barrel at that target and pull this trigger here, that's where the bullet's got to go. Don't fire the gun..! - Homing system or no homing system. Oh, shit, man! That was gunshots Where you going? Die, you little bastard What the heck is going on. God, who's that? What the hell are you doing here? I knew he'd come back for these weapons. Don't do that again. Stay out of the way and let me handle this. Holy shit! Time you got off the fucking fence ET. You gonna kill this piece of shit or not? Because poach is not a capital offense, right? Yeah, that's what I thought. Where's these other weapons? The big gamer. The Cannon? I don't know. The prop room, I guess. Where's that? Oh, shit. Right there. Let's go! Warden: We gotta get the rest of these animals out of here! Warden: Please get the safety, I'll use this one. Aw, fuck you, you ten-dollar piece of shit. Out! Voltage! You guys can't handle high voltage. Warden: What is that? A taser? I'm gonna fry his ass! Warden: Where you going? Warden: Thinking you can sneak up on him, are you? He'll never expect me to come after him. When was the last time a monkey out, spotted you? Oh, fuck you, Obi-Wan. Let's go! - What kind of leather is that jacket? Warden: Stegosaurus As in dinosaur? Now you know why they're extinct. Chief Dawes, Chief Dawes. Do you know who is responsible for the attacks? Was it a militant terrorist group? Could it have been a lone individual. Come on. Well, the good news is, uh, no broken bones, but you're gonna be sore for a while. Daddy! Oh, baby, hey, hey, hey, come here. Oh, hey. Okay, where's mommy? She couldn't keep up. Well, it's part of the course, isn't it? Oh, thank God. Oh, sweetie. When I saw the news, I thought you were... You okay? I'm okay. You okay? Really? Sure you're okay? I'm really fine, Okay? Oh, sweetie... oh, sorry. - Aw! Oh, baby. Okay, you know what? Just try to get some rest and take a aspirin for the pain. Thanks, Doc. Thank you so much, Doc. I could've told him that. Listen, Chief Dawes is out in the waiting room. He's waiting for you. And he wants to see you as soon as you get done with this Leather. Shit. Mom, dad said shit. I know honey. How come he doesn't get a lecture? Shit. Ew, he's done it again. Honey, what is it? I just realized that the kill has been hiding. I need your car. Wyznowski will take you home and I see you tonight. Keys. - What about Chief Dawes? Aren't you gonna take backup? He's already there. I love you. I love you... ..I love you. If you get yourself killed, I swear I'll never speak to you again. Warden: Lieutenant, what are you doing here? Looking for you. How did you find this place? Well, I figured he must have reason for coming here the other night, and then you were here waiting for him. Warden: I had a trap set for him until you showed up and ruined it. What is this place? Warden: The human blind. What, like a duck blind? Yes. Warden: We have thousands of them all over the planet. Warden: So we can study humans unobserved in their natural environment. It's like a game warden. Warden: Something like that, yeah. So we're just animals to you, even you and I are talking like this. Warden: Your scientists communicate with apes and dolphins. But that's hardly the same thing. Warden: You ever heard of a gorilla named Koko? No. Warden: Well, your scientists have taught her sign language. Warden: Now, she's able to communicate like a deaf mute human. Warden: She even asked for pet kitten, describing great detail of exact color and type she wanted. Warden: She named it ball. Warden: But she's still only an animal. Warden: Isn't she? Well, yeah. Warden: We've been found! Warden: Are you alright? Yeah, thank you. Warden: You'll be safer in the back. Warden: He can't use his Big Gamer without destroying his own camping ship. Warden: He can only use his poach gun. That was one of those guns that shoots many guided missiles, right? Warden: Yeah. Greg, I'd much rather be killed by one of those. Warden: Here we are. Where? Warden: His craft. Warden: I'm going aboard to set his auto-destruct mechanism, so he can't escape. Warden: You stay out here and keep an eye out for him. Warden: Alright, you've got five minutes to get out of here. No way, I want him more than you do. Warden: I'm not the one in danger. You ever heard of Dian Fossey? Warden: We're not barbarians, human. Warden: We don't kill one another like you do. No, you're just destroying entire species. Warden: And you don't? Warden: Why do you think we made your planet a protected game preserve? Warden: Why do you think I'm trying to save your life? Well you're not trying hard enough, if you ask me. That? No, stop, no. No. No! You son of a bitch! Mother fucker. Oh, man. Phil! Ow man! Warden: You're all right. Warden: That's good. Yeah, but you're not. We have got to get you to a hospital. Warden: No. Warden: It's nothing your doctors can do for me. We won't know till we try. And don't give me any crap about I wouldn't let a monkey operate on me. Warden: You wouldn't! Shit! The auto-destruct. - Girls, Daddy's home. - And he brought a surprise. - Oh, oh my gosh! Is he ours? Can we keep him? - We can. - What's his name? - His name is Warden. And... He brought a little friend with him. - Yeah, what's his name, Daddy? - His name is Warden two. - Well, wont that be a bit confusing? - No, just call him Warden the puppy and Warden the mouse. - Yeah, I like that. Um, it's kind of cool. - Well, the ayes have it. So why don't you light up the coals and I'll go get the burgers. - Honey, I'm not really in the mood for meat right now. How about we go in the house and we boil up some pasta? - Say you guys want spaghetti? - Yeah! Look at him, he's so cute! I love him. - So... a dog and a mouse. - Yeah. - Why the sudden change of heart? - Now whatta you saying? I've always loved animals, you know that.
