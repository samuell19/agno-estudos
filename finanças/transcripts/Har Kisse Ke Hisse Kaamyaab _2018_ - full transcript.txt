Let's get a glimpse of the career of our guest for the day. Where's my stuff? The package has reached Madh Island. The cops have seized our stuff. JOURNEY WITH THE STARS He's getting better, sir. I don't need the money, you silly girl. I just need some love. No! No! No! JOURNEY WITH THE STARS Tonight's a full moon. And tonight-- Uncle! We're not scared of your silly ghost stories. We're stuck here because our car broke down. Why don't you guys freshen up? I'll get some food. JOURNEY WITH THE STARS How is he, Doctor? -I'm sorry we couldn't save him. -Sometimes... Sometimes, the rich father of the bride... Or sometimes, the butler. Our guest for the day could play any role. But his most popular role was that of -Daaga's henchman, Shera. -JOURNEY WITH THE STARS Mr. Daaga, I only have one principle... "Just enjoying life, you got a better option?" Ruby! "Just enjoying life... you got a better option?" Just enjoying life... you got a better option? A traitor deserves death! You can enjoy your life up in heaven. I can't think of a character he hasn't played! JOURNEY WITH THE STARS And their lives shine as brightly as the stars do. So, we're here today... to get a glimpse of this heavenly home... this life filled with happiness... ...and this effervescent character. A star shining brightly in our city's skies who has brightened up our lives. We welcome... Mr. Sudheer. -Hello, Mr. Sudheer. -Hello. Look here! Hello. Can you please recite your iconic line for our audience? Just enjoying life... You got a better option? Bravo! -Mr. Sudheer... -Yes. why do you think this line has become an iconic line? I've no clue. There was nothing special about it. But Mr. Sudheer, do you know... this line from your film Band of Robbers... is still a rage on WhatsApp. People, even today, put up Facebook stories on weekends. "Just enjoying life... You got a better option?" I guess it's just dumb luck that it got so famous. I don't think it was that special. You're being modest, Mr. Sudheer. "Dumb luck" does not fetch you hundreds of films. Those days "potatoes" were in great demand. Potatoes? Yeah... I mean... Character actors like me were called "potatoes" back then. Really? Potatoes compliment everything. Veggies, chicken and even soup. Whether it was a comedy, a thriller or a romance... no matter who the lead actor was... potatoes like me could fit anywhere. But Mr. Sudheer... the audience still loves you. They still remember you. No. The audience only care about the "Heroes". I am a nobody. -Cut it. -Oh, come on! No, no. My mood is perfectly fine. Sir, our show is meant to inspire people. Now if you say, "I am a potato", "the line was dumb"... how can we inspire anyone? So, what do you want me to say? Tell us some stories from the many films that you did. I have a list of 490 films that you've done. How many? Sir, you know better. Here. It's 499! Not even 490! I've never counted my films. How do you know? Sir, this list is available online on IMDB. IMDB is a website. and of all the people who work in films. I got this list from the website. This is the list of all the films you've done. Your debut film in 1978. -What is it called? -499 films? Yes. It also mentions the name of the character you played. Beside Heera and Moti in Hong Kong it says... That was you, right? Your actor friend... Mr. Manmauji... he entered the Limca Book of World Records last month. Why? for featuring bald in 300 films back-to-back! International journalists had come to India to cover him. A world record? Yes! Can we please read these resumes later? -Let's shoot. We're losing light. -Yes, come on. Let's shoot! -Hello, friends! -Sir, wait a minute. Check the focus. We're rolling. Hello, friends! Hello. Namaste. Good evening. Let's go! -Mr. Sudheer... -Yeah. Many wish to come to Mumbai. Any advice for them? Bombay is full of colors. It's a world that enlightens-- -What happened? -The power-- This doesn't happen normally in Mumbai. -Is it a power cut? -Yes. Just give me two minutes. Please be seated. Manisha, what the hell is this? -Hey, Yadav! What's wrong? -What's wrong? -He says-- -Sir! The sun is going down. We'll have to pack up soon if there's no power. -No, no. I will fix it right away. -Sure, sir. Yadav! -Come on, guys! -You have no manners! Yadav! How long will it take? Just give me some time, sir! There's a problem! Sun is almost about to set. Hurry up! I'll kick you out of the society! -I knew this would happen! -What happened? He's not talking to anybody. He's doing both the voices. I can hear everything! There's nobody down there. He'll be done soon. -I've an idea! Let's have some tea? -No, no. Superstar Amjad Khan was addicted to my tea. Sit. Sit. I'll make some tea. Great! Sit here and enjoy the tea! Would you like black tea? -What the hell! -It's good for health. We can't shoot like this! There is no light. It is tough to shoot. -Get the mic -Can I keep this file? This one? I'll take it when I see you the next time. Goodbye, sir. -Thank you, sir -Thank you. I'm free on the weekends. You can come for the interview. Okay sir! I'll give you a call. -Okay. Bye. -Bye, sir! The code word is Operation Black Cobra! Alright, Shera Partner! What are you having for dinner? How come? I'm allowed to drink cola as well! Wow! Is that Grandpa? Yeah. Can't I miss you guys? -Generally, you don't. -But today I did. Then, you should have visited us. I will come on the last Saturday of the month, as usual. It's not a doctor's appointment, Papa! You should come every week, meet us. Come on, Mrs. Complaint Box! I called you to give you some good news. I have some good news as well. Ashok has been promoted and they've made him the All India Sales Head. Wow. Good. Great. Best wishes for Ashok. Best of luck to him. So, what was your good news? No, nothing. I just said it... just like that. Are you drinking again? No, absolutely not I heard some glasses clinking. Can't I drink some milk? Yes, milk is very important. Okay. Someone's at the door. I'll call you later. Who was that? Did you ask about moving in? Yes, but he ignored it, as usual. That's amazing, Sudheer! I wish I could delete some films from that list. Why? There are howlers like, "Lonely Honeymoon"... "The Tall Mafia", "Passionate Revenge". They keep a record of every single film! -Really? -Yeah! But, Sudheer... Why did you stop at 499? Why didn't you do one more? How would I know. I never kept a count. I would've completed 500 otherwise. So, why not now? Why don't you round it off! Really? After all these years? How will I get a role? Why wouldn't you? Some are dead, some have joined politics. Some are doing theatre and others are ranting on Twitter. Sudheer, your path is clear. I could make it to the Limca Book of Records as well. Of course. What a great accomplishment it would be? I would finally feel like I've achieved something. Just do it, Sudheer. I promise you... this one is going to be your best role till date. Maybe your most special one! Shera! Shera! One, two, three, four... One, two, three, four, Five, six, seven, eight We've seen this guy somewhere! How's your hair so silky? Acting is an emotion. It's a feeling. A passion! My dream is to play a character... with a multiple personality disorder. I'm yet to find it. They offered me the father's role. Why would I to the gym? -Nice. -There? Seniors, that side. If anyone can change my destiny, it's GCC! Who's that? Come inside. Come inside. Okay, action. Yes, I drink. I am a drunkard. Everybody's days are numbered. Yes, I drink. I am a drunkard. Remember me? I'm Bachchan! Were you born a Bachchan or is it your screen name? We played dacoits in Gangs of Ganges! I drink whiskey and I drink rum. I can drink gallons! The cops arrested me. I told them to stop! Even my father's an alcoholic! I don't do auditions. I'm here to meet Gulati. Your boss. Everyone out there, is here to meet Mr. Gulati. You are not special, sir. -He is "The Sudheer"-- -Please, stop talking. Just check my name on the IMBD list. Is your name on this list? Bro, if you are an actor... please give me my space. Please wait outside. Lonely... I'm Mr. Lonely I have nobody for my own My guru! Am I dreaming? How are you? Really? I owe it all to actors like you! Come... I'll show you the office. Mr. Gulati... one chance! Sir, where have you been? Really? I'm told you're now a big-shot casting director. Are you still acting, or just casting? That David sir's film, was my first and the last as an actor. -Since then, only casting. -Why? Ever Heard of Steve Bucknor? He used to be a batsman. He saw that batsmen around the world were facing injustice. Any idiot umpire would declare them out, just like that. So, he gave up batting and became an umpire. They call me the Steve Bucknor of this industry. I take care of all the actors now. Great! It's about the casting we spoke about. Dude, he's like family. Sir, we have a code. Whenever an actor bothers me, he pretends Mr. Sighania has called. Sighania sounds like the name of a big producer, right? Actors realize it and they leave. He's always been a sly rascal. That's how I welcome my actors. An applause is what an artist lives for. Right? Come, sit. What will you have? I think after veterans like Lalita Pawar... Mr. Pran, Shakti Kapoor... and that south actor Prem Nazir, you might be the only one. I know, right? Gulati, man... I need something big for my 500th film. People should remember my last film as my most special role. Memorable! I will figure something out. Hold on! I'll talk to him! Yeah, alright. Sir, remember we cast Mr. Avtar Gill in the remake of that South Indian film? The film is about to release next week. Mr. Avtar's scenes need to be dubbed right away but he's vacationing in Thailand! What the hell is he doing in Thailand? Is he still alive and kicking? And ever since Thailand has started giving subsidies every idiot from Mumbai shoots there. This Avtar Gill still calls himself a "Bhatt camp" actor. But I've gotten him every role he has done for the past 10 years What do we do now? Weren't you good at imitating people? Come on... That was ages ago. Sir, let's give it a try. -No, come on. -Yes sir, that's a great idea No, no. Definitely not for Avtar. Sir, please do this for me. And I'll get you your 500th role. A solid, fabulous and memorable one! Please, help me, sir. Mr. Sheikh... this desert refuses to end! I think we might be lost! Have faith in Allah, Habibi. I will get you actors who look more tribal than the forest tribals. Yeah, okay. Isn't he that actor? From that C-grade film controversy? What happened? Some cheap-ass film. The director asked him to do a few push-ups. And he inter-cut it with shots of that bikini model, Shehnaz. Push-ups inter-cut with the model's face and her expressions. -Can you visualize? -Hey! Hey! What are you? An encyclopedia? Stop gossiping about such a senior actor. Go for it! Gulati, I have a suggestion. Yeah? We'll get caught. Think about it. We got five scenes to do. There are five scenes, sir! I can do ten scenes in that time. And we'll have some tea as well. Now that's an old school actor! None of that digital nonsense. Yes. Yes. Have faith in Allah, Habibi! Wow! Why did you have to run out? Yeah? Yes, why? -You live in this building, right? -Yes, why? Do you have a locksmith's number? No, why? I ran out to get her and locked myself out. I left my phone inside as well. Did Mehra get you this apartment? I'll call him. Mehra, can you come here? 102 needs a duplicate key. He lives nearby. He'll be here. No, no. I have her for company. What's the "company" called? Because I'm from the city of Roorkee. She reminds me of my city. Okay, bye. "You got a better option?" No. I'm an actress as well. -Really? -Yeah! Who's making this film? It's not a film. It's a show on YouTube. The duplicate key is here. Okay, bye. Do you have what it takes? Yes! That's all that matters! And the name is... GCC. Film Stars can only do one film a year. But character actors can break records! They're more sought-after than Kim Kardashian! Here we present... What's my schedule for the day? First up, a period drama. Then, a motivational speech at a Senior Citizen Center! Then, dance rehearsals for a wedding song. A premiere screening in the evening. Hear that? Acting and actors, now have a newfound respect. We support the entire story. We're not "Side Actors", the ones who can be kicked away at any point! No more playing nameless cops, and faceless Doctors. "Drop your weapons!" What about that, sir? I hope he never wakes up! Throw away the lab coats, the lawyer's robes, the politician's suit, the business blazer, the butler's shirt, the helpless father's coat and the villain's sidekick's hideous scar! Wow, sir! What a dialogue! But this is your script for the day! But this is your script for the day! But this is your script for the day! Am I talking to Mr. Sudheer? Sir, I'm Raju Hirani, the director of 3 idiots and Sanju. Gulati told me you are back in the game? Yes. Yes. Sir, I have a role just for you. I need your dates. Oh, Raju! I mean-- Come on! You're embarrassing me. Tell me where do we meet? Sir, I am here to meet you. Just step into your balcony. My balcony? Right. Of course. -Two cups of tea, quick! -Okay. Asshole! Come here! You moron, you pissed over my 20 days of hard work! I ran up and down in the furnace of that desert till I broke my back! And now the bloody producer refuses to pay me because you did the dubbing! Avtar, man! Bollocks! I was shooting in a no network area. -I just did what Gulati told me-- -Shut up! Did Gulati ask you to dub it in your own voice? You could've at least mimicked me? No! You wanted the industry to know that... Mr. Sudheer is back! Right? Get your ass here, you English clown! Come on! Why are you recording this? Sudheer, he's calling you. Come down. What are you recording? Is this a circus? Mind your own business! You could have come upstairs. We could have talked. Give me my money. Buddy... The same way you got the balls to do my dubbing. Or, I will drag you to Actor's association for the fraud. He is in a meeting. -Now he'll slap! -No, he won't. What is this? Some tip? -Don't block the view! -Move on! -Is this some tip? -Stop touching me? Let me go. I'll give you the money Go inside! What? Hey, Guruji! Avtar insulted me in front of everyone. And they recorded it! What will people think of me? I have some self-respect. I promise that no one will tarnish your name. Have you heard of The Prince of the Battle? -Who's that? -Hey, pass me the tabloid. Had you been there, I would've thrashed you! Look at this, sir! Superstar Rahul Chopra's next film. Holiday release. Would you like to play the prince's father? -Will they stop the shoot if I say no? -Of course, they will. You have your own style when you take these potshots as well. Have this. After all, the 500th role is about to begin. When's the audition? Your audition will be on Saturday at 02:00 p.m. No, I won't-- I told him shortlist 50 if you want! First you got me to dub, now auditions. Come on. -Buy a bucket of paint. -What for? Because you are going to paint the town red! Mr. Manmauji, show them your photo with the award. -Come on! -Right away! This is the photo. Yeah! -Wow! -That's nice! -A superstar! -Yeah! That's a great picture! Really? Manmauji, what happened to that monster movie? I passed it on to Birbal. -Really? -Yeah. Don't remind me of that movie. I have grown old waiting for that payment. Back then we were paid on time and there was always work. Now everyone wants us to audition first. Why are you afraid of auditions? Everyone has to go for auditions! Do one thing. Bribe the director with some expensive liquor. -You'll get a call back! -Exactly! I could never fathom how Avtar keeps getting work? The producer that he is sitting with has been accused of molesting. Also, he's thick with that Gulati. Beware of Avtar. He can steal anyone's role. Come, let's have a drink Where to? Code word is, Black Cobra! -What's this? -The witch's mane! -This hair looks real. -This is real as well! This will be our secret. But isn't your birthday next week? Today is the dress rehearsal for my birthday. Just like the ones the have for your school play. What's happening? -Well you've surprised us today! -Yes. Last night Ashok and I were talking... about fixing your bedroom wall. -The one at the back? -Yes. Come on, that looks like Modern Art! Please, Papa! It looks really shoddy. Mehra Uncle must think that the daughter lives like a queen. And treats the father like a peasant. Why don't you move in with us? Here we go again, Mrs. Complaint Box! Tell your mother that your grandpa has his own life. He's here to tell you that he won't be visiting you this Saturday as he will be working. -What work? -Some work. Like what? Like when I had quit, I did not know that I had done 499 films. -Really? -Yes. So? -Rahul Chopra? -Rahul Chopra! -Really? -Maybe. Namrata... get Anu ready. Go with her. -Come, baby. -Come on, go with her. We have to get ready for dance class. Of course. You remember what happened during your last film? This is not that kind of a film. This is a big film. It has Rahul Chopra. Chandra Barot. It has a big holiday release. Once I do this... I would be amongst legends... Lalita Pawar, Pran, Shakti Kapoor. But you promised me, you'd quit. Why do you need to do it? Do you really need money? For myself. It has always been about you. Here's the rent from the store. And this is for you. Dp they still sell these? Why did you call these two at the same time? I had called them half an hour apart. Sudheer sir must've come early because he's excited? Should've called them half a day apart. Now handle it! So, Mr. Dubbing artist? Mr. Sudheer, Mr. Gulati wants to see you. Devika, please cast him as my side kick. See, I still look out for you. The kingdom of Mewar still bleeds from history's wounds... Sorry sir, for the other day. I didn't know... Are you here to kill me? No sir, this is to get you in the zone. Wear it. Now's the right time... Hey-- Just a second Where do I look? Not in the camera. -What is that place? -Mewar, sir. The kingdom of Mewar still bleeds from history's wounds! Remember! Mighty wars are won not by valor-- You're just warming up, right? What was this? Warm-up, right? Let's do one more. Yes, sure. A little softer, sir. Ready? Ready. Yeah. The kingdom of Mewar still bleeds from history's wounds! Remember! Mighty Wars are won -not by your valor-- -Sir, just one minute. Sir, this is a conversation between a father and son. The son is eating an apple, you're having a drink. It's a conversation. Just a conversation. I thought we're going for a war! But before the war, they must eat as well, right? Gulati, isn't the screenwriting a little off? Maybe this is what they call "realistic writing". But this is what the director wants. So just communicate. -Father-Son? -Father-Son. Conversation. Yes. -The kingdom of Mewar still bleeds -No, no! Cut! Cut! -from the wounds of history! -One minute! Might wars are-- You're a sophisticated king! But the dialogue is so heavy. Heavy dialogues need a soft touch to leave a deeper impact. Just have a conversation, sir. Less is more. Give me two minutes, Gulati. Please? Man, this old shoe won't fit, no matter how much we shine it. Keep the camera rolling. -Ready? -Yes, sir. Please come. You see this sword? Look at its shine and say your lines. -Yes, dialogue. -How? Forget the son. Just look at the sword. We'll just try a rehearsal and let's see the impact. We'll record it later. Just say the lines. Yes. The kingdom of Mewar still bleeds from history's wounds! Mighty wars are won not by valor, but by those who hold their nerve. Victory comes to those who wait for their moment. But today... the situation isn't favorable. Cut, Got it! -What? -Come here, sir. But I didn't do anything. Play it. You recorded this? from history's wounds! Look at the goosebumps! Victory comes to those who wait for their moment. But today, the situation isn't favorable. -That's your, natural? -Yes, that's natural. -Soft and subtle? -Yes. Okay, let's do another take. But sir, I got it. Sir, this is what I want. It's done. I'll give you another one. What about me? What about the actor's satisfaction? Your daughter isn't wrong either. If my wife was alive, she would get me. It is impossible to talk to my daughter. Hey! Your wife's favorite radio still works? You haven't scrapped it yet? Mehra, all things old are not useless. Wow! Did Marlon Brando ever wear a wig? It's open. My fridge screwed up, can I please get some ice? We might be short on whiskey but never on ice. In the freezer. Why don't you come join us at the party? No, my dear. We oldies will bore you guys. -Yeah, that's true. -You enjoy, my dear. My boyfriend, Jai, is a die-hard fan your movies. You know what's common among all of them? They play guitar? Every single one of them committed suicide, exactly at 27. Mass suicide? No, individually. Why? It's a mystery... You mean, we're useless, if we don't die by 27? How old are you? Whenever I am asked, "What's up?" I always say "Enjoying life... you got a better option?" I remember a rare film of yours. -Which one? -Earth meets the Sky. Don't you love that film's song? -These clouds, this season... -To be in love, we need no reason He always sings it. It's my favorite film. I loved you in the film, sir! He had these facial scars... Everyone thought he was the killer! But in the end, he turns out to be the good guy! Earth meets the Sky? -That film was a flop. -You know why? Because it wasn't typical. Why did they always cast you in typical roles? The producers would do it to save the film stock. They would call artists like me and say, "Mr. Sudheer... just repeat what you did in the last film. Yeah, ditto. Totally! And then they called us "One Take Artists." They saved film stock, we got roles, "You got a better option?" That's just amazing! Mr. Sudheer... there's a small problem. The Director liked Avtar Gill's audition. What? I insisted that he watch your audition. But he said I don't want any confusion. I forced him... Sir, you still alive? And just as he saw you performing he started jumping! He started screaming "I have found my king!" He Said, "Gulati, you've found a rare gem!" Sir, you've been selected! Congratulations! This is your 500th role! Gulati, you aren't pulling a fast one on me, are you? No sir. The Producer wants you. Congratulations. Party hard! I'm sending you the script. An old oak tree had faded Out into the oblivion Out of the blue There's a bud budding Seeing the bloom Its withered branches Have started to unravel This new hope Has brought in fresh ideas This hope's writing a new story This new hope Has brought in fresh ideas This hope's writing... A new story Lonely dark nights Have discovered cheerful days The tired sun... Which was about to set Has awakened with hopeful rays Yes, it's bright and sunny out there! Come see it The grumpy postman Has a spring in his step as well It's late. Come join me Come on Yes, tell me? It's midnight and it's your birthday. What are your plans for your birthday? I'm shooting tomorrow. I had told you, right? Yeah. With Mr. Pawan Chopra. Can we do it tomorrow? Papa, will you be done by evening? Yeah, why? Because we're throwing you a birthday party at our place. Okay, I'll see you guys tomorrow. Okay, Papa. Alright? This new hope Has brought in fresh ideas This hope's writing... A new story This new hope Has brought in fresh ideas This hope's writing... A new story No... I said the break is over! You feed bloody sandwiches to stuntmen and say, "Break's over." I'll get you some more on the set. Let's go now. The sword in my belly is making me starve. You promise us a lavish meal and feed us sandwiches. Come on, please. The break's over. Is this the set of The Prince of the Battle? Yes, but the lunch is over. Please come. I'll take you to the makeup van Yes, sure. Please. It's a pleasure to work with you. You're on the right track. This country needs good directors more than doctors and engineers. Good. Make sure you give me your number. Sir, please come. Hello, sir! Remember me? Tipnis? We worked on The Yogi's Robe? -Remember? -Yes. -Sir, is this the same old wig? -Yeah. Great! -How're you? -Good. Good. What about you? I'm doing great. We know how to hide wrinkles, how to shine dimples. You're right. Old age is such a bitch. Why? The comedian from yesteryear. What happened to him? His body was found after four days. No one noticed he was dead. He used to live alone. That was the right thing to do. You live alone as well, right? Hey, Rahul! I'm good sir. I've your blessing with me. Kapil! Yeah. Yeah. Come in. Come. Come. Have a seat. No sir. Please, finish your make up. And, I'll have a smoke and come. How respectful was he? -Sir, your shot is ready -Now? Let's go. Shot is almost ready. Come on set in five minutes. -Trim it a little. -What's going on? Look here, sir. No, sir. Please have a look. What's this? Wow! That's Ms. Tun Tun! I got to know you are playing the king. Hey, that's Bob Christo! Keshto Mukherjee! That's me! He remembered all the dialogues from the 70s and 80s films. Your dad has an invaluable treasure for you. Sir, one autograph? One? Take five man! The selfie generation is asking for an autograph. And that of an artist and not the star. Where the hell are you? Kesto reminds me of... -Do you have the scene? -Yes, sir. What was your name, Dheeraj? Shibu Das! -I'm from Orissa. -Same thing. Listen... Can you score a 30 ml for me? I mean, I am back on set after a long time. And this book got me excited. I just need some. -Just get some. -I'll ask the production controller-- No! Stop! Let me try. Just some whiskey. Get it? Of course, the food will be over if your guys eat lunch twice! What are talking about? You're feeding them sandwiches! -I'll do something. -Mr. Lucky... -Yeah, tell me? -Sir... Mr. Sudheer is asking for a drink. Now? It's 02:00 p.m. -What do I tell him sir? -Say "No." Are you crazy? Yes, tell me. What do you need? Step behind. Please. Oh, wow! Cinema is blessed to have you back! In fact, as soon as I saw your audition... I saw my king come alive on screen! So, the first shot... -It's the moment right before -Okay. -your son goes to the war. -Alright. Sir, the thing is... First, we'll do your close-up. -What happened? -Nothing Right! Then, Rahul's close up. Then, exactly at sunset... Not there. Here. As the sun sets, I will take a wide shot That's a great shot! I mean... I love it! Hey! -Let's go! Ready? -Go where? Hey... how're you? We met last year at Diwali! Let's go, guys. -What about my close-up? -After him He behaves as if his father owns the film. But his father does own the film. Can you give me my script? Hey, somebody give him the lines, please! Leave it! Here, sir! Always keep the script handy! -Sir, your phone? -What? I hope it's on silent mode. And keep it with you. Come on. All set? Come on, guys ready? Going for the take. My brave son... the moment to crush your enemies is here. Those cowards have challenged the brave hearts of Avantikapur! Your victory will be the resolution to this war! Take this royal sword! What the hell! Sorry, the sword is stuck.
