A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for a time of adversity. Let's go. Sorry. There you go. Here we are. So... The house is a bit cold but it will get warmer. How are you? Are you alright? Would you like some water or anything else, Javi? You'll see, you'll be great here. The two of us. You'll see how great. AMIGO You have to drink it off.

He has told me about your lungs. Ready? OK. Here it goes. Strong, strong, strong. Alright, very good. Don't worry, it will get better. It will be better next time, you'll see.

This way you can call me when... He's right there, how embarrassing! Don't worry. Wait! Fuck wait! That's it! Come on! Shut up... Hey... I'm alone this weekend. He's taking the kids to his mother.

He has only me. Yeah... Sure. See you. Radio Hora... Keeping you up to date with what is happening every hour in Spain. A wave of cold weather is coming. There will be heavy snowfall during the weekend. Provincial Deputations have set as a major priority that no town becomes isolated by road. Come on, you're doing great, Javi. Get some rest. Do you see how easy it is? If you do this once a day, it will improve. So if you do it a couple of times, even better. I'll see you on Tuesday. Come on. Here we go. That's it. Let me get the towels. Javi.... This is Diana. Hi, Javi. David has told me a lot about you. I'm going to leave you two alone, OK? That's right, so we have some privacy. How handsome. Very good, Javi. We are going to have fun here. Javi, I'm going downtown, OK? I'll be right back. David. It's Lourdes. We need to talk. David? David? Some roads will be closed during the day due to the accumulation of ice sheets. -Yes? -Bed... pan. The bedpan? Here we go! There you are. I'm coming! Coming! Damn it. What... What's wrong? Why did it take you so... long, huh? I've been calling you for half an hour. If you are not... going to come when I ring the bell, maybe I should write to you a letter, or what? Like you were a Minister. It's been half an hour. -Sorry about that. -This is cold. It's cold... And bring some milk... Milk for the coffee... It's too strong. The cold weather wave expected for this weekend is coming ahead of time and it will be here tonight at heights of 200 meters. Come on, Javi! Come on, Javi! Come on, Javi! You got it! Getting better every time, you see? Come on! You're all set for the Olympics games, honey. Come on! Let's go! Will you shut up? Please? What's wrong with him? Damn it. What... What's wrong? She won't pick up? No... No wonder. Because you have plans? What did you expect? This chick, man. You know what? Better so. So it's the two of us. Sure... Way better. You will all die, whores! Whores! Fire will burn you for all eternity... and you'll be fuel to the flames! You will all die! I will kill you! Hi, David, it's Julian. -You ordered Stilnox 50 mg for today. -That's right. OK, well, we won't have it until Thursday at the very least. -Until Thursday? -Yes, the roads are closed. -I don't have a supply. -I see. As soon as we get it, we will let you know. I can call you back. Yes, please... Hello? Yes? What? What are you talking about? Coming! What? Wait... It looks like you are inspired tonight. Bastard! What is this doing here? What is this doing... Why would you put it there? -I didn't do anything. -Sure, you never do anything. You are always there, quiet, and you never do anything, right? So it got there by itself. It plunged on its own. What are you talking about? I'm sorry, man. But be more careful, OK? Damn it, man, Javi. Fuck, man. Now I have to clean it all. Look what you have done! Why didn't you call? What did I bring this for? -Why did I give this to you? -You don't get it. I don't want to see you. Don't touch me. Don't touch me! I want to die. I want to die! Finish... Finish what you started. Get it done. You killed her. You killed her! It was an accident, Javi. Please... I could try and... I can't get them! Just wait, Julián, please. -No, David, David. -Maybe I could... No, no you can't. Not even the police are driving. I don't have your pills nor I can get them. What do you want now? Who's there? So how did you sleep? Well? How was your night? Did you get some rest? Are you... How are you? -Did you wake up? -No... So... -Hello? -Hi, David, it's Julián. Hey, I still don't have them. As long as the roads are closed, we remain isolated, so there is nothing I can do. Are you alright? It was just her... Coming! David... Damn... Hey, I'm very happy that you came to my place. ...getting my work mixed up with my private life. Many brand me as a psycho... They are wrong... Sorry. Put that down. Put that down! Where is the missing part? Where is it, huh? Put it down, bastard... Where is it? -Where is it?! -Don't touch it! You will never forgive me, right? You killed her. It was an accident, Javi. You can't put that on me. I can't put that on you? I think I have every right to put that on you. Don't you think? Son of a bitch. Asshole. I can't put that on you? I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I think I have every right to kill you. Hello? Guys? David? Guys? Javi? Javi? Javi? But... What are you doing here by yourself? Let me. Come on. And David? Come on. Let's go to the bedroom. Come on, champion. Go. Come on. Exhale... Come on, that's it... Very good... Don't move! Don't even breath! The slightest movement could make us plunge into the abyss. -Look what a cute butterfly. -No! No! Radio Hora! Keeping up to date with what is happening every hour in Spain. I heard a voice from Heaven, saying to me: "Write: Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord. From henceforth now, saith the Spirit the may rest from their labours, for their works follow them." Today, at this special time of the year before Christmas, we wish to remember those who are no longer with us, our dear departed who have gone to a better place. I am going to help you, OK? I am going to help you. Javi, it doesn't make any sense to keep on living like this in your condition. I finally get it, OK? You don't have to keep doing these things. Come on. Javi! Come on. There you go. Come on, Javi. Eat it. Come on. I'll give you some water now. Come on. You see? Come on, just a bit more. Javi! You need to eat, Javi. They can't think I wasn't taking care of you. Do you understand? Would you like me to get in trouble? Would you like them to put me in jail? Come on, man. Help me out a little. Are you mad? They'll find out! Hi! Hey, I'm sorry, Eva. You... You won't need to come anymore. Well, the insurance won't cover it, you know? How come? And... And you know, Javi is doing so much better now. Plus you have taught me how to perform the exercises properly -Yes, do them once a week. -Yes, sure. Anyway, if you need anything, at any time, call me. Sure. Well, thank you, OK? -Bye. -See you. David! I'm going to have to tie you up. Eva... -Can I kiss Javi goodbye? -He's asleep now. I'm sorry I didn't tell you anything, I made you come here... Don't worry, I live nearby, you know that. Eva... Eva... Eva... If your ever need something, anything, call me, okay? Yeah, sure... Let me walk you outside... I need to grab some straps for the horses... and we can talk. Eva... Eva... Help... Help... me! Oh look, he's calling for you... Wait a minute, I'm coming! He's getting nervous... But in any case, I will call you after New Year's Eve, to check up on Javi... Yeah, sure, thank you... I'm coming! He's honking. He might leave without you... I'm coming! I mean, he keeps honking... It's so annoying... He is honking... Imagine Javi wakes up, he has real trouble falling asleep... Well, I've told him already to wait... I will call you after New Year's Eve. By the way, what's your plan? On New Year's Eve? Nothing... We'll hang out, the two of us... You could come down to town and celebrate in the square! So we could eat the grapes together! Us? No way, no, we'll stay here, it'll be great the two of us... Javi needs quite, you know? Yeah, sure... poor him. He is so lucky to have you... I mean, you know? The important thing is that you are together... What else could we ask for? What else could we ask for? Wait a minute, I'm coming! We'll be here like Marquises... Well, ok, I'll go now... But hey, if you need something, anything, call me, okay? I could bring you some marzipan! Oh no, no marzipan... Or some, torrijas, I can make the best ones... No, no, we are not into sweets... Javi doesn't eat sweet... It really is no problem, I will bring you some, I mean it... No, no, thank you, you don't need to bring anything... We don't have a sweet tooth anyway... -Ok, well, I'll get going then... -See you! Help! Here! Here! Will you just wait, I said I'm coming! Here! Eva! I'm coming! And thank you again for coming, really. Eva! Wait! Thank you, guys... Happy New Year! Happy New Year! A good transition into the year, that's what we really need... Good health... Bastard! -Good health and work, right? -Sure, we need lots of that... -Take care, you two! -Thank you and see you! Don't forget to remove the seeds to prevent Javi from choking. Yeah right... Happy New Year, see you! -Yeah, bye... -See you soon, okay? Come on, let's go inside. Tonight. We have to do it tonight, Javi. Do what? Your death... You're crazy. What? You're crazy. No, you are crazy. No, you... You! You! Don't worry, I won't leave you alone, OK? Should I turn on the TV? At Christmas, the warmth of friends makes you feel something special. It makes you feel that you will never be alone. It makes you laugh, it makes you dream. That is why. ...wishes you the happiness that only a friend can give you. At Christmas enjoy friendship. I'm going to miss you. What will I do by myself now? What? What? Nothing, I just wanted you to come closer. They go for just 4 seconds... and then come the great 12 golden strokes that will bid the year farewell. It's almost time, it's a few seconds past 59... I will say nothing further to leave you with the bells... Ladies and gentlemen, let's await the chimes of the Puerta del Sol clock. Listen up! I love you... Well, among the good time these people are having, a new year has been born. It has been a happy delivery. Happy New Year! Congratulations! And please allow me, on behalf of TVE to wish you a new year full of peace, hope, love... Love and joy! Blessed be it and you too. I hope for health, peace in the families, and also joy for the next 365 years... And after that God will provide. Let's not forget that peace should be the most important thing for all of us, besides joy. AMIGO
