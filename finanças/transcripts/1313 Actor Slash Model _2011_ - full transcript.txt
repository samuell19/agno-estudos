Hey, how'd the audition go? Interesting. Oh yeah? They like you? Who knows with those guys. But there was this dude, he came barging into the casting room and totally flipped out. What? He was upset he didn't get a part? Pretty much. You serious? Oh yeah. He got right up into the casting director's face. Started threatening him and stuff. They had to call security. That's what I keep telling you man. This business will wear you down until there's nothing left. Hello? Hello? Hello? Guys? Hello?! Guys? Hello? Guys? Guys? Hello? [intense music] How you doin'? Hello? Hello? Guys! Some party! [door creaking] Hello? Matt? Hello? Hello...? [slicing sound] [splash] [electronic music] [indistinguishable teasing, laughing] [mysterious music] [heartbeat] I don't care if the shoot was rained out for three days. That's not my problem! My problem is money. So you can tell the director if that pilot doesn't come in on budget I'll fire him and shelf the production! Damn it Brad. So. Have you decided if you're going to renew another season of "Fall Boys?" Don't worry, Babe, I've got you covered. I know it's just...I was thinking maybe I might take a break. You know, from the show. What are you talking about? I just figured I've been playing the lead role of Jake for three seasons now and I'm thinking I might want to take a break. Check out my options. Are you kidding me? You want to quit the lead role of successful television series? And do what? Oh, don't tell me you want to pursue movie roles! Because I can tell you right now, you may share Brad's name but Brad Pitt you're not. Suzy you wanted to see me? There's my new leading man. Come in, come in. I was just getting ready to review your tape again. Brad. Why don't you make yourself available later and maybe we'll finish this up, hmm? Yeah. Jerry? I knew it was my roomie. What's it been like two, three years? Three. Well how've you been? Been better. Still pursuing the acting career? You could say that. Hey I told you then and I'll tell you now. Follow me. I could get you in to see my modelling agent and then, bam! I guarantee you'll start getting called in for all sorts of roles. I'm an actor, Matt. Not a meat puppet. Well this meat puppet's landed recurring roles in two Suzy Prescott series. Don't you think that's messed up? I mean all these shows. They don't care about casting quality actors. They just want to make sure you look good when you take your shirt off. So. What's the big deal? I mean Hell. I think I'm a pretty good actor and...I look pretty good with my shirt off. Relax. Have some fun. And call my print agent in the morning. Make yourself available. Like Hell I will. You're Brad May. Yeah. So what? I auditioned for your role. That's right. Three years ago. Before they called in all the model-slash-actors they auditioned real actors. Are you insulting me? Because I really couldn't care seeing as I'm done with that role. As a matter of fact you could probably take another stab at it. I got to go sweat this out before I hurt someone. I couldn't agree more. It's like she thinks she owns me, you know? Yeah she gave me my break but that doesn't me I get to be her boy toy until she decides she's done with me. And believe me: The next hot thing is right around the corner. You know, that's what irks me even more. How ungrateful you are. I mean. You're a model, you're not an actor. You should never have been cast in that role, and now you're complaining about it. I just want out. No strings attached, no threats from Suzy like that 'you're never work in this town again' crap. I just want a nice clean break. Well I think I can help you with that. [metallic swish] Poor ungrateful Brad. Just wants a nice, clean, break. [stabbing sound] [Jerry's voice, echoing] Before they brought in all these actor-slash-models, they auditioned real actors. So Kerry. Now that you're working for me I want you to know that everything you see here, is at your disposal. I'm not like other producers. I am very involved with the process and I treat all my leading men as family. Understood? You bet. Good. Suzy. I heard another actor was promised my role... Oh don't worry about him. He's been taken care of. So you just enjoy. After all, this party's for you! That's funny. I thought it was for both of us. Seeing as we're both on the new show, right? Just kidding. Of course the party's for Kerry. He's the leading man. I'm just his trusty side kick. The comic relief. Whoah. The party is for both of us. It's for everyone on the new show. Thanks buddy. You know how many auditions me and this guy have fought for? It's guaranteed. Everytime I walk into that wait room. There's Kerry. And guaranteed, he always gets the gig. He's like my doppleganger. Very cute. Trent, if there's going to be a problem with you sharing the spotlight with Kerry, I want to know about it right now. because if there's something I can't stand, it's set problems. I don't have the time and I don't have the money for them. Hey, easy. I'm not a problem. I told you: Comic relief. Yeah, I'm in hysterics. Hey look, Trent. You gave as good of an audition as anyone. But, as we know, they probably flipped a coin. It picked the star. It picked the co-star. Sure, whatever. Flip a coin. But personally, I take my career a bit more seriously then that. [door slam] [tapping] Come on, Kid. Get out here. You don't get invited to Suzy Prescott's and sit in the car. I told you. This is my turf. My playground. So I get to choose who gets to...gets to...Damn it! Who gets to stay and play. Thanks. I don't why I can't seem to remember these lines. Maybe I can help run some with you. Really? That'd be great. How'd you know that? The line? I auditioned for that role. Really? I didn't see you. At the audition. I was called in on an earlier round. Look, Dude. You're too stiff. You need to relax into the role. Really feel the action. I mean in this scene, it's hot. I mean these guys have been waiting around in this hundred degree airless, windowless warehouse for two hours. Only to get screwed around. You're right. Of course I'm right. Now, let's take this off. Much better. Exactly. See? Are you ready? Yes. Alright, here's the deal. My boy comes and works for you and I collect commission. I told you. This is my turf. My playground. So I get to choose who gets to stay and play. And your boy there. He's not welcome 'cause... cause...damn it! What the Hell am I going to do? I can't remember my lines? Suzy just said she hates set problems. Well maybe she should have hired a real actor then. I mean, no offence Kerry but, wasn't your last gig modelling for an underwear ad? Hey. I got this fair and square. Really? Because last time I checked, I got this role fair and square. You're the other guy. The other actor. That's me. The other actor. Or as I like to see it, the only actor that was and should have been cast in your role. Listen, I heard that they haven't cast it yet. Didn't you? I mean, I'm pret ty sure I just heard you talking to Suzy about it. But you know what? It doesn't mat ter. It looks like I'll be doing Suzy a favor. I mean if she doesn't like set problems and you obviously aren't cut out for the job, well then I guess cutting you out isn't such a bad idea. [stabbing sound] [echoing voice:] 'Well maybe she should have hired a real actor, then.' 'I mean, no offense, Kerry, but wasn't your last gig modeling for an underwear ad?' 'Of course, before they brought in all these "actor-slash models" they adutiioned real actors.' 'Last time I checked, I got this role fair and square.' 'Well maybe she should have hired a real actor, then. I mean no offense, Kerry but wasn't your last gig modeling for an underwear ad?' 'Last time I checked, I got this role fair and square. 'All these TV shows, they don't care about casting quality actors.' 'They just want to make sure you look good when you take your shirt off.' 'I'm an actor. I'm not a meat puppet.' Ah, the best casting agent in town. How are you Paul? Been better. What? Business is slow? It's pilot season. Had a bit of a problem at the casting house the other day with that actor you cast and then dumped. Had to get security to escort him out. Thin skinned. People shouldn't be in this business if they can't hack it. And who's this? Logan Branch. You may have heard of him. Of course. How could I not, seeing as you were just listed on EW's list of hot new up and comers. That's right. And he just landed the lead in one of RHN's new pilots. Really? Why didn't you didn't bring him in for my casting? What? You're not happy with your new cast? [phone ringing] I've got to take this. Why don't you get yourself a drink, take a swim, enjoy yourself. Aah. The smell of new meat. Trent Oxley. Or I should say Ox. They said Oxley wasn't catchy enough. Logan. Or rather Mike. That's my real name. I guess it wasn't catchy enough either. Well Mikey, sounds like you've hit the big time. RHN. Not bad. But are you ready to take on the bigger role? Excuse me? You know, the role of the big star, celebrity. Kiss ass. All that's way more important then the role. I mean for that all you got to do is memorize your lines and show up. But for the rest of it, it's a dance. A dance you'd better learn quick or else you'll be eaten alive. And Suzy Prescott, she's one of the hungrier ones. You know. I get the sense you've got a lot of anger brewing inside of you. What are you talking about? I mean, I've known you since we dropped out of college. There's something really biting at you. Ever since you came here, you've been sulking the kitchen, and the Jer' I know, he would have been the life of the party. Talk to me. You want to know what's biting at me? You. And all these other actor-slash-models. No this again. Come on, Jer, you can't fight it. I mean it's what the public wants. They don't want to see ugly faces when they get out of their crappy jobs. They want to see us beautiful people. And that's us. And you. And you need to learn to work it Jer. I know you can do it. Instead of being a hater, you could be a joiner. Wow. What an inspiring speech. You know, you could make t-shirts with that slogan. 'Don't be a hater. Be a joiner.' Jerry have you met Trent Powers? He's a bit of an over achiever, to put it nicely. Hey if you're happy being an underachiever that's your deal. Not underachiever, just not willing to step on whomever it takes. You still pissed about that gig I beat you out on? You didn't beat me, you told the casting director I had a conflict of interest. Well you were repping that jean company weren't you? Yeah, but that was for the client to decide whether it was a conflict of interest or not. My agent was in the process of working on it until you stepped in. Why, are you going to sidle your way into Kerry's lead role, too? Who knows. Maybe the trusty sidekick will steal the show. Jesus Trent! Sorry about that. Better go top up. That guy's a Jerk. Poor Kerry's got to work alongside that goon. Yeah poor Kerry and his leading role that should have been mine. What are you talking about? I had that role. Of Lee Saunders before Suzy Prescott decided she wanted one of you sell outs to play the part. Look, that sucks, and I'm sorry about your luck Jer but you got to let that all go. That's right. Be a joiner, I forgot. What about being a sell out? You know, I'm done with this Jer. If you want to wallow in your bad luck, go for it! I'm done. That you are. [stabbing sound] 'You want to know what's biting at me? You, and all these actor-slash models.' 'I had that role. Of Lee Saunders before Suzy Prescott decided she wanted one of you sell outs to play the part.' 'Before they brought in all these actor-slash-models, they auditioned real actors.' 'I'm an actor. I'm not a meat puppet.' 'Last time I checked, I got this role fair and square.' 'Maybe she should have hired a real actor.' 'I had that role. Of Lee Saunders before Suzy Prescott decided she wanted one of you sell outs to play the part.' 'You want to know what's biting at me? You, and all these actor-slash models.' 'You know, all these TV shows, they don't care about casting quality actors.' 'They just want to make sure you look good when you take your shirt off.' Hey kid, why don't you relax? Have a swim? Suzy likes seeing her guests have fun. So how long does RHN have him for? At least a season. Showing off the goods are we rookie? Let me show you how it's done. Ah, look at that idiot. He'd better not make me sorry I cast him. Yeah, why did you cast him? You know he likes to stir things up. I know. He just rated so damn high with the female viewers. Why don't you go find a room and sober up? Hey Rick it's Trent. Look I got a line that the lead role in that show I just landed might be back up for grabs... don't worry about how I know, just make sure you get the jump on this, alright? If you do I'll bump your commission. You are bit of an over achiever, aren't you? What do you want? I want exactly what you do. Fine. That's cool. I'll make a deal. You get the lead and I keep my gig. Sound good? Hmm. It would, except I'm not sure if I could trust a co star who won't even report it if he found me all chopped up. No. The more I think about it, you'd probably just stab me in the back. [stabbing sound] Like what you see? Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to snoop... Not at all. Feel at home. Who knows? Maybe one day you'll be on one of my shows. Let me ask you this. Did you get a call for an audition for my latest show, 'Fallen Men'? No. I mean I heard that you were casting and I even asked my agent, but he said RHN really wanted me and that I shouldn't overexpose myself. Overexposed? And you believed him? Of course you did. Logan did Paul say anything to you to make you believe you had the part? Not really. But he did say he had an in with one of the producersat RHN, and that I shouldn't commit to anything until I'd heard from him. That little weasel. Excuse me? You might want to put your clothes on, seeing as that your ride's about to leave. You shut me out. Of what? You know what. That hot new thing that RHN just scooped up. You made a deal with Gary that if you brought him Logan you'd get a cut. Okay, so you got me. But just so you know, I'd do the same for you, as long as you offered me something a little extra. You're a snake Paul. I've been casting out of your house for ten years! I put you on the map in this town when you were just a backroom casting upstart no one had heard of! And I''ve thanked you time and time again. 'Thank you' does nothing for me. What would have helped me and my ratings, is if you had brought me the next hot thing and not sold him from under me to Gary Klein! Now why don't you get Hot Shot and yourself and show yours door. Bitch. Logan? Hello Paul. Sorry, do I know you? Hey you're that guy I had kicked out of my space. Yeah, that was completely unnecessary. You threatened me and my staff. Well don't worry. I'm past that. What the hell are you doing? Didn't you hear me? I said I was past threatening. Now I'm on to doing. Where the Hell is Brad? I don't know what you're playing at here. But I can tell you, you're killing any chance you have at a career in this town. You know, that's funny, ' cause I thought that was your job. Hey, I had nothing to do with you losing that role. You were only too willing to bring in another round of actors, or should I say models, because we all know they're not really actors. Even though you knew somebody would get screwed. Hey, I only do what the clients says, and Suzy wasn't happy. She wanted to see more faces. And you were more then happy to oblige, even though you knew somebody would be getting screwed. And that someone just happened to be me. You know, I've always wondered what it would be like to run a casting session. I mean, what really gets you the role? Is it your look, the lines, or just the mood in the room? Let's take you for example. Let's say I was casting the role of the guy who gets killed. Am I looking for someone who looks scared? Am I looking for someone who looks defiant? Come on. Show me what you've got. That's it. Not bad. Very believable. In fact. Congratulations. You got the role. [stabbing sound] Hello? Hello...? Hello? Hello...? [metallic swish] [echoing voice:] 'I'm passed threatening. Now I'm on to doing.' Hello? Hello?! 'We all know they're not real actors.' Hello? Suzy? Hello? Hello? 'Come on, show me what you've got.' Hello? Is anyone here? Hello? Hello...? 'I'm an actor. I"m not a meat puppet.' Hello? Is anyone here? Come on, guys, this isn't funny. Hello? 'Before they brought in all these model-slash-actors, they auditioned real actors.' Hello? Hello? Hello. [stabbing sound] Hello? Hello? Hello...? Hello? Anybody home? Hello. Is anybody here? Yoo-hoo. Is anybody home? Hello? Hello? 'I'm passed threatening. Now I'm on to doing.' Shooie. 'We all know they're not real actors.' 'I'm an actor. I'm not a meat puppet.' 'All these TV shows, they don't care about casting quality actors.' 'They just want to make sure you look good when you take your shirt off.' Oh shit. 'Come on. Show me what you got.' [stabbing sound] Brad? Brad, are you in here? Miss Prescott. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. What is it? I can't seem to find Paul. Well I can't seem to find anyone. It's as if we're the only ones here. Why don't you come with me to my office, and uh..we can talk some business. So. Your good friend Paul screwed me from getting my hands on you. I'm sorry... He made a deal with Gary so no one else could snap you up. I didn't know I... Of course. And I'm not accusing you of anything. But, just to show you there are no hard feelings, I'd like you to come on board and play with me and my boys. I could offer you, maybe a guest role. Or even a recurring character. But whatever you decide, I want you to know... That you're going to be very well taken care of. [laughing softly] Who the hell are you? You're not serious now, are you, Suzy? Take another look. I'm not into playing games. If you haven't been invited I suggest you leave. Oh, I was invited. In fact. This party should be in my honor. You know, as your new lead on Fallen Men. Of course. You're that actor, the one we cast and then replaced. So what? You're here to try and convince me what a bad mistake I made? We made it perfectly clear to your agent we've recasted. And you were compensated for the time you were on hold. I'm just going to get going... No, actually I think you should stay right there. Because I'm pretty sure I can convince Miss Prescott that I'm the one meant for the role. Okay, um, fine. If it's more money you want for your trouble, then I'm sure we could cut a deal. I don't want the money. I want to act. Because unlike all these model-slash-actors you have roaming around here, I've honed my craft. I've been working towards my big break since I was a kid. And now I'm ready for it. Here you go! You're going to want this on tape. Because it's going to be the best damn audition you've ever seen. Please! Feed me my lines. Please, you don't have to- Do it! If you leave now we can cut a deal. There's nothing you could offer me that's going to get me off the hook. You know that. I know that. There is. I mean I could get you the role. Any role. Whatever you want. I mean look at you. This is some of the best acting I've seen. Please. Why would I trust you? Because you're right. I need actors. Real actors. Like this! [stabbing sound] [impact] What? You didn't think I'd leave anybody behind, now, did you? Let's make that deal. 'Before they brought in all these actor-slash-models they auditioned real actors.' 'I'm an actor. I'm not a meat puppet.' 'Last time I checked, I got this role fair and square.' 'I'm passed threatening. Now I'm onto doing.' 'I mean, all these TV shows, they don't care about casting quality actors.' 'They just want to make sure you look good when you take your shirt off.' [indistinguishable voices on the TV] Hey, go back. [sirens on TV] Television producer Suzy Prescott is known for her hit TV crime dramas. But today, her own home was the scene of a real crime: A series of horrific murders committed by local actor Jerry Heinz. More news on this topic later in our program. That's the guy. You know the one I told you was taken away by security at my audition. You know maybe you should think about quitting the business. I mean look at that guy. It's put him right over the deep end. And I've seen how it gets you down. I mean hell, the rejection could make anyone crazy. Maybe you're right. I mean my uncle's been bugging me to go work for him. Steady work. Steady paycheck. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad. [phone ringing] Hello?...Yeah...Really? That's awesome. Great! Thank you. That was my agent. That audition I went to... I just got the role. [dramatic music] [music continues] [music fades]
