[ORGAN PLAYING] [POLKA MUSIC] [THUNDER] DJ (ON RADIO): IT'S 3:31 AM and a brisk 67 degrees in Burbank. You're listening to the late night sounds of Larry La Ci√©naga on KLT FM, reminding you that the all-night theater is still running that terrifying new movie by Corman Rogers, "Enema Vampires." Sheer terror, as only Rogers could give you. That will be playing continuously through Thursday, so all you horror fans go check it out. And now back to the music on KLT. Remember, for the sound that pulsates, keep your ear to the KLT. You wanna party? You got the bread? And the mayonnaise too. Get lost, freak. [ORGAN PLAYING] [SPLASHING] [FLUSHING] [FARTING] [CREEPY MUSIC] [FUNK MUSIC] Hey! What you be doing with my woman? [CREEPY MUSIC] What you looking at, bitch? Yeah, now you're talking. Oh, mama! [BELCHING] - Papa, you forgot Dupah. - Oh! MAN (ON TV): And now-- ANNOUNCER (ON TV): --concludes this test of the emergency broadcast system. If this had been an actual emergency, you'd have been blown to shit by now. [STATIC] - --serves up. It's this week's Movie Mac, "The Fearless Vampire Killer." [EVIL LAUGHTER] [CARTOON MUSIC] [EVIL LAUGHTER] [OWL HOOTING] [CARTOON MUSIC] - Ow, ow, ow, ow! [GROANING] FATHER: Dupah? Dupah! In here. I should have guessed. Here's your breakfast. What? Enjoying your meal? Well, it is a little cold. You were sleeping late again, weren't you? Papa, please don't start this again. How can I help it? Every night you do the same old thing. You wake up late, pee, then watch television. From sun down to sun up, you doing nothing worthwhile. You should be out at nights, roaming the streets, pounding the pavement, attacking young ladies, piercing necks. Look at you! You're a full grown vampire, and you've never bitten anyone in your life. When I was your age, I sucked more blood than a California landlord. Dad, I don't have to hear this every night. Well, you're not going to hear it anymore. You want to know why? Because you're going out tonight. You're going to seek out the victim, and you're going to bite it. [THUNDER] Bite people myself? Ewwgh! No, ew! You do it! I have been the blood winner long enough, now it's your turn. I'm-- I'm teething. And I'm serious. We had the same problem with your older brother, Sphincter, Lucifer rest his soul. [THUNDER] I will not tolerate another loser in the family. Dad, that's disgusting, actually biting people like that and then sucking? Ewugh. [SCREAMING] You will not turn out like Sphincter. I want you to look at how nice your sister turned out. She goes out at night. She gets her own food. She bites 15 to 20 people a week. Yeah, and god knows what she picks up. Yvonne, I you to take him out and see to it that he bites someone tonight. Dad! Yes, Papa. And don't bring him back till he has truly lost his virtue. Oh, act like a vampire! Oh, and please, lay off the ethnic humor, would you? DUPAH: You know, I really don't think I can do this. Relax, there's to be a first time for everyone. Well, my fangs are too small. I don't even think I could get them in. Size means nothing. You have to understand, Dupah, Papa does not want you to turn out like Sphincter. He never could succeed, even though he tried. Sphincter, Sphincter, that's all I ever hear about. Was he really that bad? Much worse than you. He even hated the sight of blood. DUPAH: Well, what exactly happened to him? I don't know. I was taking him out on his first blood drive many, many years ago to show him how to do it, basically like I'm taking you tonight. As I recall, he was even more reluctant than you. I won't know what to do. I've never seen anybody do this before. Watch me. I took him to the fanciest place in Burbank. He had this habit of wearing these ridiculous caps, which really didn't help his appearance. Not that anything could. Well, I reasoned that if he could actually watch me in the act of penetration, then he'd see how easy it was to do it himself. - Good evening. YVONNE: I thought I'd warm him up by ordering a Bloody Mary. I knew she was going to say something like that. YVONNE: We then scanned the bar for some likely candidate. Then we spotted him. If a weasel could have a face, that was the man. So making sure that Sphincter was watching, I went over and made my move. Good evening. Good evening. Excuse me for being so bold, but are you waiting for someone to join you? I have been, and now she's just arrived. YVONNE: It was much too crowded in the bar to be intimate, so I asked the [INAUDIBLE] if he had an automobile. He said he did, so I convinced him it would be much more exciting out there alone. [BREAKING GLASS] We went out to the man's car, and under the moonlit sky, I had my way with him. [THUNDER] [CREEPY MUSIC] Oh, I can't believe my parents would ever do that. Oh, Yvonne, wipe off your face. You look like a pig. Oh, not on my jacket. That's my new new jacket, I just had it washed. Now get back in there and do just what I did. Oh no, I'm not snuggling up with any guy. With a girl, imbecile. Oh, that's different. OK. YVONNE: So back he went in search of a victim of his own. [MUSIC - "MY BABY'S BACK"] (SINGING) Don't care what you wanna to do. Everything that's cool is cool. Don't care what you gotta say. And my baby's here today. My baby's back. My baby's back. Gonna have a good time. [SCAT SINGING] My baby's back. Said, my baby's back. We got lots of time, and I'm feeling fine. 'Cause my love has finally come around. [SCAT SINGING] YVONNE: Sometimes, things don't go quite right on the first attempt. Anyway, I looked off in the distance, and no sooner did could say contrived, I spotted her, a perfect victim. Then Sphincter saw her, and was more than willing to give it another try. [CREEPY MUSIC] Hi there! Hi, how's the family? Did you know Jesus loves you? Oh great, I was-- oh no, put that away. That's right, he loves you, and he loves me. You maniac, but that cross away. VICTIM: It's really wonderful-- SPHINCTER: OK, yeah, I know. --that Jesus loves everybody. SPHINCTER: Yeah, but just-- yeah, I know. VICTIM: Oh, the Bible tells us-- No, not the cross, you maniac! 10 million people in this city, and I-- - He died on the cross you know? - --get a lunatic. Yeah, I agree. YVONNE: The humiliation was just too much. That's when I had to leave. We never saw him again. I guess he was just too ashamed to return home. Oh, he was such a waste. But you, Dupah, you can do it. - You think so? You have the desire. All you need is someone who can be gentle. And we shall find that person tonight. [CHATTER] That was the worst movie I've ever seen. For god's sake, Ernie, all you do is complain. I just thought it sucked. Well, I liked it. You would. Vampires, shit. Only you would be sympathetic enough to care about an idiot vampire in an idiot vampire movie. Well, I like vampire movies. I suppose you get off on the idea of getting bit, huh? Ernie, bite this. You are just too weird for me. I've had it with you, baby. - You liked the movie? - Hmm? The movie? Oh yeah, I love horror films. And-- and vampires? Especially vampire films. No kidding? I do too. Vampires are neat people, huh? They sure are. I must have seen "The Horror of Dracula" 20 times. - 20 times? - Yeah. Wow. Oh, it's great when Christopher Lee bites his victims. Oh, it just gives me chills. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Me too. - No kidding? No. Really? YVONNE: You're doing fine. Oh, what's your name? Delores. Delores what? Lane. Delores Lane? Hey, has anyone ever told you your name sounds almost like Superman's girlfriend? Never. Never. What's your name? Dupah. Dupah? Is that Polish? I don't know. YVONNE: Come on, Dupah, make your move. Can I buy you a drink? No, no thank you. Oh, come on! Well-- well, it's coffee or something. We could talk more about vampire movies. Come on, please? It would be fun. Well, OK. [ACCORDION MUSIC] [NON-ENGLISH SINGING] So he's ready to pounce on her. The theater's quiet. The tension is mounting. Eroticism is oozing in the air. So what does the jerk I'm with do? He belches loud and clear. I mean, the whole mood was lost, oh! He is such a jerk. So why do you see him? He gives good head. [CHATTER] However, Ernie's history now. There's plenty of nicer guys around. Yeah, and some of them even like vampire movies. Oh, god, yeah! Have you seen "Enema Vampires" yet? Not yet. Oh, it's great. I got so turned on when the vampire went for the girl's throat, oh! [GROANING] Yeah? Some pretty good bite scenes? Pretty good? When he looked into her eyes, oh, I warped my seat. And then when he opened his mouth and showed those large fangs-- Oh, he had large fangs? Well, certainly, whoever heard of a vampire with teeny fangs? Yeah, who? Oh, and his castle was so atmospherically Gothic. I live in a castle. You do? Well, I've lived in Burbank all my life, and I've never seen a castle. 2450 Spasmatic Lane. It's the only castle on the block, you couldn't miss it. Well, how long have you lived there? All my life. My dad built it years ago when my family emigrated out here. Where are they from? I never asked. Oh. Oh, it's almost light out. It is. Um, look, I really like you a lot, and I'd really like to see you again. What are you doing tomorrow night? Well, I-- let's see, I have to work till midnight. Work where? Oh, I work at the Holiday Health Spa. It's over on Piggle Street. I'm an instructress there. Can I come by and see you? Well, sure. [ROOSTER CROWING] What? What was that? I think it was rooster. In the city? Poetic license. I've really enjoyed this a lot. I'll see you tomorrow. You're very sweet. Oop! Excuse me, I'm sorry. [BREAKING GLASS] [INTERPOSING VOICES] [ORGAN PLAYING] Where have you been all night? I met a girl. A girl? Excellent! Did you go all the way? Well, not yet. But I will, Papa, I will. FATHER: I think you will. What was her name? Delores Lane. FATHER: Hey, she has almost the same name as-- I know, I know. It is wonderful, son. Now you get some sleep. You need your strength. I always knew sooner or later, you would come around. And I want you to know that your father is very, very proud of you. Just remember, it's always rough the first time. But once you get used to it, ha, ha, you'll love it! Good morning, Papa. Good morning, son. [ORGAN PLAYING] Hey, Dupah. Dupah, it's me, Sphincter. Hey, wake up. How's it going, Dupah? Sphincter? You died. Thanks for the progress report. What are you doing here? Keeping an eye on you. I know you've been going through some rough times. I'm here to help you. Help me? You couldn't even help yourself. I would have eventually gotten the hang of it if I hadn't of died on my first time out. How did you die? I'm so ashamed. It was only my second attempt. DUPAH: Oh now, not another flashback. SPHINCTER: Don't worry, this one's not as long as the last one. Anyway, it was that girl's fault. After Yvonne split, then hell started popping. You mean you don't believe Jesus loves you? I never said that, lady. Put that thing away, please. You don't believe he's our Savior? SPHINCTER: Please, lady, I never said that. Let me think about it. You don't believe he died on the cross for us? Let me think it over, I'll tell you about it later. Oh Lord, give me strength to beat the Holy Ghost into him. CHOIR: (SINGING) Glory to Jesus, he's our man. Throw the bum in a garbage can. Hee ya! CHOIR: (SINGING) Judo for Jesus day and night. He [INAUDIBLE] [GROANING] [INAUDIBLE] Now let's kick his big [INAUDIBLE].. We do [INAUDIBLE] when Jesus calls. We [INAUDIBLE] SPHINCTER: The pavement was kind of hard. I could tell it was hard by the sound my skull made when it hit it. Well, after all that dyke's abuse, I couldn't even move. I was out all night. Well, when I came to, the sun was rising. You want to talk about a legitimate pisser-- I couldn't muster any strength at all. I tell ya, those old vampire movies were right. When the sun gets you, hang it up. You want to talk about pain? I started splitting and burning up. Shit, I felt like the main course at Benihana's. [GROSS NOISES] Hey, that boy's on fire, Martha. Sure is. [GROSS NOISES] [BELCHING] DUPAH: Wow, it sure was rough for you. SPHINCTER: Yeah, but it doesn't have to be for you. I saw you tonight, you and that cute little tomato, Lois? Delores. SPHINCTER: Whatever. She loves vampires, she'll love you. I saw it. Play up to her. I'll try. Good. OK, I got to go now. I'm due at a poker game with Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. Thanks, Sphincter. It's all right. I'll see you later. Now don't panic. [ORGAN PLAYING] [SITAR MUSIC] - Om. Om. Home on the range, where the deer and the antelope play. Like, where you been, like? Om. Mm, I met a man tonight. Well, like, what happened to Ernie? I thought you were supposed to be seeing him tonight, like, for sure? Every time Ernie and I get together, all we do is argue. The show-- that's all we did, we argued all night long. I had to sit there and listen to him complaining all throughout the show. I can't stand it. I don't want to see him anymore. But he's so cute! He's also a jerk. Yeah, but I hear he gives really good head. I'm going to bed, I'll see you in the morning. Wait! Tell me about this new guy. Oh, he's so sweet and sensitive. And he loves vampire films. You and your vampire films. Like, when I get to meet this guy? Well, he said he'd come buy the spa today. You can meet him then. Would that be cool? What's his name? Dupah. MISTY: Is that Polish? DELORES LANE: Uh, I think so. Hey, what are you doing up at this hour? Poetic license. Om. Om. [SEXY MUSIC] [GROANING] [SQUEALING] Motherfucker one. Motherfucker two. So has this real sensitive guy called you yet? No, I haven't heard a thing all day. I think he was kind of like, toying with your affections. Mm. Hey, after work, do you want to like, go to the Stugat Club and watch the male strippers? And then like, wait till they let the real guys in, and then like, get them to buy us drinks and stuff, and then like, leave without like, doing anything? Hi there! How are my two favorite instructors do-- Ted, get off. Do you wanna? Hey, I heard you and Ernie had a fight last night. Our final fight. TED: You mean it's finally over? - Mm-mm. You mean you're available again? Ted, please. Hey guys, Delores is finally available! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Tacky, Ted, tacky. I guess that means you won't have an escort to take you to the pool party this weekend? Pool party? I told you. You know, fun by the pool, Friday night? I don't remember you mentioning it to me, but you probably did. Well, if you need an escort-- You'll be the first to know. So you and Ernie split up, huh? Is it true that Ernie gives great-- Hello, Delores. Dupah! I am so glad you came by to see me. Dupah? Is that Polish? I'm pretty sure that it is. I'd like you to meet some of my friends. Dupah, I'd like you to meet my best friend, Misty. Hello. For sure. And this is my friend, Ted. How you doing, Dupah? Listen, I have a couple of more hours on my shift, so why don't you hang out in the Jacuzzi or something, and I'll see if I can get off early? Okey-dokey. I'm sure there's some gym clothes in the men's locker room. That's fantastic. How do I find the men's locker room? Oh, it says like, men's locker room on the door. Come on, I'll show you. Bye. She left Ernie for him? Well, he may have some great redeeming value. Yeah, like what? Well, who am I to judge? I mean, maybe he has a great personality. Yeah, well, I think she just got tired of macho guys like me and Ernie. Besides, I think she's out to make a fresh start. Hey, guys, Delores has a new boyfriend. [GROANING] See it. Well, it's never too late to make a fresh start. After all, today is the first day of the rest of her life. If today is the first day, then tomorrow is the second, and next week-- wow! It certainly is hot in here. The bubbles tickle my nipples. I've never been in one of these before. Better still, you'll last longer. What kept you? I was beginning to think that you wouldn't show. Hm? Tell W the charade is working. Everyone out there thinks I'm a real actor. I beg your pardon? But I don't think I can pull it off much longer. Some people are beginning to detect my phony accent. Hopefully, I'll have this assignment wrapped up by June. Any questions? Yeah, who's W? Our boss. Our boss? Aren't you Felix Matches? No, my name is Dupah. Is that Polish? Isn't this the Happy Day Health Spa? No, this is the Holiday Health Spa. Shit! [SPY MOVIE MUSIC] How's it going? Did you get around to biting her yet? Sphincter! You going to bite her or not? Later. Don't be nervous. Just kiss her a little bit. And when you get her hot, stick 'em in. I don't want to hurt her. Oh, it only hurts for a second. After that, she won't be able to get enough. DUPAH: How do you know, you never got any? Hey, hey, let's not get personal. (LAUGHING) How'd you do that? Hm? I never even saw your lips move. No, really, that was very good. I know, I used to practice ventriloquism myself before it happened. [ORGAN PLAYING] It? I used to play, sing, dance, bowl, ski. I did it all before it happened. [ORGAN PLAYING] And thank god there's no full moon out tonight. What's wrong? You'll think I'm crazy. No I won't. Well, I'm a queerwolf. A what? A queerwolf. You see, years ago during the full moon, I was bitten by a queer. Ever since then, when the moon rises, I become one. Uh-huh. You don't what it's like. I go through a change. My eyelashes become longer, my lips become redder, my hair becomes curlier. I-- I have trouble keeping my wrist straight. I'm really sorry to hear that. You don't know the worst of it. Every morning after the transformation's taken place, I wake up with the worst pain in my backside. Uh, there's no full moon out tonight. Half moon. Half moon? That makes me bi. Heh, heh, that's-- that's good. OK, [INAUDIBLE] nice talking to you. Oh? Listen, I got somebody over there. Even a wrist that's strong and firm, and holds itself up high may become limp when the moon is out and the owner becomes bi. [CREAKING DOOR] [THUNDER] [MOANING] [THUNDER] [PANTING] [MOANING] You gonna do it? Yes! Now? Yes! Go for it. Oof. I'm sorry. Don't worry. Stuff like that's happened to me before too. It has? Sure. Try it again. Give it a shot. Don't fuck up. Will you get out of here and let me do this myself? [GASPING] [CRUNCHING] Oh, Jesus. Hey! Hey! Hey! None of that in here. We're not smoking. You would have been in another minute. I just can't get-- USHER: This is a family theater. DUPAH: I'm sorry. Sorry? Is that all you got to say? We got fucking kids in here. They sees youse doing what you're doing, they get out of here, and they get ideas. they want to try it too. And they go home, and there's nobody for them to do it with. So they watch television, and they're frustrated. Then they go out and get a stranger. And the stranger gives them VD, and they get really sick and hate women altogether. So then they get a hacksaw. Deviants! (YELLING) Put that out! Do you know how many people get lung cancer every year? Children see you doing that, and they go home, and they try it. And they get hooked. They smoke, get cancer, and they get a hacksaw. You see it on tele-- [EMERGENCY BROADCAST TONE] Movie finish early? No, we decided to cut it short. Oh, that's far out. Do you guys want to like, be alone and fool around and stuff? No, I just came in to say goodnight. Uh, Delores, there's something I've been thinking about all the way home, and I really have to tell you. Either of you guys want some cold chicken? Because like, I bought some earlier, but I couldn't eat it all. And besides, I hate dark meat. No, thank you. Um, there's really something I think you should know. See, do you-- do you like me? , Oh, yes, very much. I'm glad. Delores-- MISTY: There's a six-pack of Gatorade too if you want any of that, like. Meeting you was the best thing that ever happened to me. And well, I want to make sure I keep no secrets from you whatsoever. See, I'm different from other guys. Now I'm a little apprehensive about saying this to you, but I know you'll accept me and, you'll accept-- Hey, is that only outfit you own, like? I'll talk to you tomorrow. Uh, but my pearls? Moody, isn't he? What are you watching? Television. Real boring movie. You're watching a test pattern. God, If I thought it was a test, I would have studied. [ORGAN PLAYING] [THUNDER] Thanks for the help. Well? Maybe. You blew it again, stupid. Papa, please don't nag me now. I'll do more than nag you. How would you like to wake up with garlic in your coffin? You're a disgrace. And you won't get any more food from me. You can starve yourself for all I care. Maybe if you get hungry enough, you'll do the right thing. Tomorrow. I'm going to tell her tomorrow. You don't tell her! You bite! Her! You don't ask for permission, you just do it. She may not respect me afterwards, I'm going to tell her first. You're so stupid. Stupid! You're going to wind up just like your brother, another loser. Tomorrow, I'm going to tell her tomorrow. I just need more time to warm up to her. You couldn't warm up to her if you were cremated together. [HUMMING] How's it going? Hey, Misty? Misty? [SQUEALING] - Oh, god, Ernie! - Ooh! Hey, you're looking good, girl. How you doing? God, didn't you know that every time you startle a person, that person loses like, five minutes out of their life? - Sorry. Well look, I'll let you have 10 minutes of mine. So where's your roommate? What are you doing here, anyway? Well, wasn't it nice of Ted to invite me to his party? Is Delores coming tonight? She's not interested. Who said I was? You did. Like, every time you mention her, like, your pants get tighter. Well, I'm maybe just a little interested. Mm-hm. She's seeing someone else. She is? She thinks you're a jerk. Then why did she go out with me so long? You give good he-- Hey, hey, Ernie, how you doing? Hi, Ted. Fine, how are you? Good. Good to see you.

Fickle. Don't touch me. No, it's not what you think, really, it's-- What was that all about? Well, that's because there's a moon out tonight. You see, I'm not like other guys, honest. But I mean, he does that. Oh, Dupah, please don't be a fairy. I don't think I could handle it. DUPAH: I've got to do it. I've got to do it now. [LOUD HEARTBEATS] I don't know what's the problem with me. DUPAH: One little bite. You can do it. Sometimes, I get so moody. My period started two days ago. DUPAH: That could make things easier.

[CREAKING] [WATER DRIPPING] [CRAZY STOMACH GROWLING] What are you doing? I'm sharing in your kinky fantasy. You obviously went to a great deal of trouble to impress me, so the least I can do is patronize your ambitions. [CREAKING] DUPAH: You mean you'll let me bite you? DELORES LANE: (LAUGHING) Uh-huh. DUPAH: Honest? DELORES LANE: (LAUGHING) Oh, I'm sure. DUPAH: You're not afraid? DELORES LANE: Uh-huh. DUPAH: Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. OK, I'm going to bite you now. OK. - OK, here goes. - OK. [LAUGHTER] This isn't funny. Now come on, relax. (LAUGHING) I'm sorry, it tickles. I'm going to try it again. OK. [LAUGHTER] Why are you laughing? What is so funny? What are you giggling about? I'm sorry, try again. (LAUGHING) I promise I won't laugh. (GIGGLING) It's just so funny and so theatrical. The coffin, the castle. Oh my god, you're biting me. [MOANING] [MUSIC - "THEME FROM ROCKY"] CHOIR: (SINGING) Sucking blood now. You're a stud now. Suck out blood now. Yeah! Yeah! I'd like to see Dolores? She's not here. Well, where is she? I don't know. She didn't show up for work. She's probably spending time with her boyfriend. Do you mind if I come in, Misty? Sure. I was just going to roll a joint. Want some? Yeah, yeah, maybe just a little. Was I good? Mm, you were fantastic. I've never felt so fulfilled. Do you want to hear a secret? What? You were my first. Honest? Mm, I'm so flattered. [CHUCKLING] Do it again. Again? Now? Now. Now! [WILD LAUGHTER] [ROCK MUSIC] Oh god. [INAUDIBLE] [GIGGLING] Yah, blast off! [SQUEALING] I never thought it could be like this. I never even imagined. The touch of your teeth, the feel of my blood becoming yours, the beating of our hearts in unison. Oh, Dupah, you're so wonderful, so sensitive, so caring. How was it for you? [SNORING] Dupah! You're all alike. Da, da, da, da, da, da, da. [GROANING] [LAUGHTER] [BLOWS RASPBERRY] [CACKLING] Ah, heck, Misty. I love her, you know that? I know. Do you think she loves me? Nope. [GIGGLING] Why not? Because you're a jerk. [LAUGHTER] Well, I'm not a-- I'm not a jerk. Yeah you are. Am not. Are too. - Am not. - Are too. - Am not. - Are too. - Am not, I'm-- - Are too, are too, are too. D2. [WILD LAUGHTER] But I'm-- I'm kind of a nice guy. I've got everything a girl would want. What? Well, I've got-- well, geez, what do I have? I have-- You've got me. I have Boardwalk and a hotel. I have poise. Uh-huh? And good looks. I have hair on my chest. Delores loves that. I think I'm going to be sick. You know, she's been gone an awfully long time. Maybe we ought to call the police, what do you think, Misty? Guy, don't be a dumb jerk. She's out with Doofus, and they're probably fooling around or something. Yeah. She'll come home when they're done. [BELCHING] She probably won't be too happy to see you here, either. [STRANGE NOISES] I think I'm going to go to bed. How about a Lay? [WILD LAUGHTER] Don't forget this. Ooh, my Rubik's Cube. You can let yourself out. Oh. Oh, god, what time is it? Can't just-- oh, these are getting heavier here-- [CREAKING] Huh? [CHOIR SINGING] Oh, gee. [WIND BLOWING] Hi, Delores. Oh gee, I missed you, baby. Hey, come on, look, I'm sorry I condemned your taste in movies. Right, we all make mistakes. Now look, you want it, I want it. Let's let bygones be bygones, huh? Come on, baby. You're talking to old golden tongue. [CREEPY SINGING] I knew you wanted me. I knew it. [SCREAMING] [YAWNING] How's it going? [SCREAMING] Will you learn to knock or something? Where's Delores? I saw you do it, you son-of-a-gun, you. Do what? The old fang bang. It was great. DUPAH: Where is she? Oh, she stormed out of here about an hour ago. Stormed out? Yeah, I guess she wanted to bask in the afterglow. Women, huh? Now where are you going? It's almost light out. I've got to find her and bring her back here. You can't go out now. But you can! Sphincter, would you find for me and bring her back here? Why? The sun is going to come up. She'll need a coffin, she could die. Don't be an asshole. Forget her. You got your piece of neck. And you'll find other people, and they'll be just as much fun. Listen to me, you four-eyed boner. Now you better help me out, OK? Now you go to the health spa, check her apartment, but get her back here! Yeesh, you do like to give orders. Maybe what you need is a bony foot up your ass, and I'm just the-- oh, shit-- I'm just the one that could-- [ORGAN PLAYING] Wait a minute. You're in love with a girl you bit? (LAUGHING) That's absolutely ridiculous. You can't keep biting the same person over and over again, you know? You mean I have to do this again with somebody else? Oh, shit. What did you think? One person has an endless supply? I'd rather die than have to go through this again with somebody else. You will die you don't go through this again with somebody else. You'll feel better after a good day's sleep. Sure. [CREAKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CREAKING] Did you find her? - Well, sort of. - Well, where is she? Is she all right? Hi, Dupah. Delores? Well, I guess it's true what they say about sunlight and vampires, huh? Is that all you can say? How about oops? Oh, Delores. Don't worry about it, kid. It's a natural mistake. Let's go. Where are you two going? Among the corpses, where we belong. And what am I to do? Dupah, you're being a big baby. You don't need me, and you don't need her anymore. Just go out there and bite on, you know? Put more notches on the old fangs. What we had was wonderful, Dupah. And I'll never, ever forget you. I love you. Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Do you know he's called me a four-eyed boner? [PIANO PLAYING] [DRAMATIC MUSIC] [POLKA MUSIC] Wait for me! [SQUEALING] Hey! [CHOIR SINGING] Now I'll never get to jump her bones. [DOG BARKING] Huh? What the? Hey! [DOG GROWLING] Hey! Hey! Git! Get away from that! stop that! Where's your owner? That's a person's foot you're chomping into. Hey, hey! Come back here with that! [DOG GROWLING] [CARTOON MUSIC] Come on, give me my foot back! You get your tail back over here, you no good puppy of a bitch. I mean it, I'll make a Chihuahua out of you. Listen to me, I am going to-- uh-oh. Ooh, wait a minute. Oh, hold on, no, I was just kidding. No-- [DOG BARKING] Let's talk this over-- whoa! Now this really pisses me off.
