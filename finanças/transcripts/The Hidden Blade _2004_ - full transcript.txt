Money can buy you lots of girls in Edo. She'll hear you! No matter. I'll take my leave. Take care. Get yourselves posted to Edo, too. Thank you for coming. He's a man who'll rise in the world. Let's hope so. Why do you say that? I just have a bad feeling about all this. May I come visit? You're expected. My sister's got the house in an uproar making the cod stew her hubby likes. I'm not her 'hubby' yet. Whoops, I'm sorry! No, you're not married yet, are you. No. That was good! It was? Did you make this stew, Miss Shino? Yes. With a little help from Kie. 'A little'! Listen to her! Mother! Kie! Who made this cod stew? Miss Shino, of course. The secret's out. Kie made it, didn't she. I sliced the radish! Any child could do that. What'll we do with you! This? You sliced this? Very well done! You didn't have to say that! You're horrible! Sir, you shouldn't... ..make fun of her before Squire Shimada! Kie! You poor thing! Yes, you're right. I'm sorry, Shino. Come on, pour Samon a drink! Squire Samon... this is a good time to ask. Do you mean to take this girl to be your wife? Why do you ask? When her father was alive, our stipend was 100 koku of rice. That is not so much less than yours. But after he had to commit suicide, we were reduced to 30 koku per year. Our prospects for advancement are not good, either. Are you not worried about what your family will think... ..if you marry one of us? Don't be concerned. I choose who I marry. That is good to hear. There's just one thing that displeases me. What? You'll be my 'elder brother'. I don't look forward to that. Fool! It'll go to your head. Kie, did you hear that? Agh! Yes, sir. He's not making sense! I understand perfectly how Squire Shimada feels. What?! See? Drink up, 'kid brother'! Kie watched over my sister as she was married to Samon. Next it was her turn to leave us... ..when she married into a merchant family. It was as if the light had gone out in our house. Three Years Later. Kie! Hello, sir! I thought it was you! Are you well? I'm sorry I couldn't come to your mother's one-year memorial. It was rude of me. Shopping? Yes. For cloth and thread. Let me buy you a kimono collar, then. What have you got that would suit her? You've lost weight. I was in bed with a cold last month. That's not good. Are you better now? Yes. How's this one? We'll take that, then. Why, thank you! I'm so pleased... Are you happy? Yes. Why are you crying? I'm so happy to see you again... ..the tears just came. Is your husband taking good care of you? Are you sure? I'll treasure this collar. Excuse me. Um... You're married by now, aren't you, sir? Uh, no... I'm afraid not. Since Mother died the house is a mess. Perhaps you could come and do some cleaning. I promise I will. You know, Kume... I saw Kie today. Oh. I thought she was happily married into the Iseya family... But today... she'd grown so pale and thin in the shoulders... She was always so cheerful and healthy... Now she looks ill. Oh, dear! I asked if she was happy... ..and she started crying. The poor girl! I wanted to help her, but I didn't know what to do. Perhaps I should have just brought her back here with me. I've cared for her ever since she was 16... ..like a younger sister. And now she's... I'm going home, sir. You are? Good night. I couldn't help but worry about Kie. I was also feeling guilty about my inability to understand... ..the principles of the new western artillery. Now, this is vital. Wearing the fingerstall, you insert the right forefinger into the vent. This prevents air from being expelled when the shot is loaded... ..which could be disastrous. Bang! A premature discharge, causing burns and even death. I had a colleague die that way. Next occurs the 'ranging' of the gun. This involves four techniques: One: Quadrant. Two: Tangent Scale. Three: Breech Sight... ..and Four: Pendulum Hausse. You learned these yesterday. Questions? Yes? This book says the English 'Armstrong' cannon... ..has a vent piece, so you don't have to stick your finger in it. It costs more. One Armstrong costs as much as 500 of your old matchlocks. Wars now are won by the most expensive weaponry. By money. Such is the age that is upon us. Sensei. Yes? I'm sorry, but... I haven't the foggiest idea what you're talking about. It'd help if you'd speak the way we're used to... He can't! Then why get an instructor from Edo? Could you at least translate all those English and Dutch words? They put my head in a whirl. The longer I sit the stupider I feel! You find this amusing? Is this a time for levity? To prepare you to face an emergency with modern artillery... ..your clan has summoned me from Edo to this backwater! This is no laughing matter! With all due respect, sir... a 'backwater'? We are hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa shogun. At the Battle of Sekigahara our first chieftain... I am well aware of that. I apologise. We will pause for a moment. Stupid back-country samurai! Not that far! Left... Left! All right! Plaatsen! 'Post'! Laadde! Load... Watch, you men. When he shouts, you all move. That's the western way. Don't stop to bow! See what he's doing? That's 'aiming'. Vaardig! 'Ready to fire'! Ready! Vuur! 'Fire'! Bang! Sailing far over the castle wall, the shot lands amid the enemy ranks... ..killing dozens of samurai! Hurrah! 'Post'! 'Load? I will explain, Milord. When the gunpowder explodes, the gun is thrust violently back. This mound of earth will bring it to a stop. It is then returned to position and reloaded. Stand back, please. You're in danger there. 'Post'! We will now fire the cannon. Target: The enemy castle tower! 'Fire'! Be careful! Watch out! The north-country spring, when leaves burst forth... ..as if waiting for... the snow to melt... ..was a time I passed in an empty, barren state of mind. Fire! Watch out! Get back! Get back! Thank you. Uncle! You've come far, Uncle, to attend this memorial of my mother's passing. I am truly grateful. Thank you very much, Sir Bunemon. Has your health been good? Damn your civilities! What was that disgraceful performance before His Lordship the other day?! Aye! What is a samurai doing... ..welcoming these confounded firearms! Firearms are not for samurai! Disgraceful! In battle you stand ready with sword or spear. 'I, Kanbei Katagiri, do challenge you!' Thus you announce your name, and let the skills you have mastered... ..decide the victor. That's how it must be! The westerners are barbarians. They feed on beasts! With all due respect, Uncle... ..we have fought since the Genpei War with sword and spear... ..and bow and arrow as well. But in those 700 years the west has devoted its ingenuity... ..to creating new weapons of war. Aye! Inventing new things, discarding the old. That's the way of the west, and perhaps one of these days... ..we'll have to change how we think about war, and everything else. Discarding the old?! It's those western airs you put on... ..that keep you from finding a wife, you young oaf! 'Oaf'? I have a wife. It's Munezo here who doesn't. It's you? What's the connection between firearms and a wife for me? Everything's connected, you fool! Featherbrain! No-account! Disgrace! Uncle... The refreshments are ready. Who are you again? Munezo's sister. The tea's ready, 'Father'. They really lit into you, 'Elder Brother'. And you, 'Father'. I've always hated that man. He's so full of himself! He had no call to talk like that, spraying spit all over the place... It's my own fault for not finding myself a wife. Aye. You can't beat me yet, 'Father'. Kane, bring my sewing box. Brother... What? Your cloak's ripped. I couldn't take my eyes off it at the ceremony. Well, they do say single men breed maggots... But still, he's getting really scruffy. He wasn't like that when Kie was around. Oh, Kie... how is she? I'm worried. I think I'll... Is something wrong with Kie? She's in bed sick. She's sick? Is it bad? It looks that way. The clerk from the next store was here, and he told me... ..that from the day after her wedding Kie was up before everyone... ..cleaning and cooking for all the apprentices... ..and bathing last at night in everyone's grime. The clerk said anyone would get sick that way. That's a real shame. He said she miscarried last fall and they gave her no time to rest. And now she's ill they won't spend the money for a doctor. That's terrible! Her father came to see her. They said Kie was of their family now, ..and he wasn't to interfere. They turned him away. They are terrible. How long has she been in bed? She hasn't been seen in the shop in two months. If you knew that, why haven't you been to see her?! I couldn't go to a merchant's house! Where are you going? I've been worried about her all through the winter. I'll go see her. Hey! I'll go, too. Well! What can I do for you? Your daughter-in-law once served in my house. My name is Katagiri. Oh, yes! Kie's told us all about you. I've heard Kie is ill. I'm here to see her. That's very nice of you. Yes, she is ill... But I'm taking good care of her, so you need have no fear. Once she's recovered, I'll have her come and thank you. Is she very ill? Not seriously. A circulatory problem. It's quite common. But I'm told she's been ill for two months now. Has a doctor seen her? Of course! Our family doctor attends to her. Since I've come all this way, I'd like to see her once before I go. Kie is my son's wife. I can't have a man visiting her, former employer or not. The very idea! You refuse? Yes! I have young people working here to consider. I will see her. Samurai or not, the answer is 'no'. Now leave, please. I'll see her whether you like it or not! Shall I call the Constable? Where is Kie? Take me to her! Hey! She's no use to us anyway! This room's freezing! Kie... Do you recognise me? Your house... I didn't come to clean your house. Forgive me. I do. I was so busy... ..all through New Year's. Then I got sick... ..and I couldn't get up. No? I'm afraid if I go on like this I'm going to die. But... I wanted to see you first, sir... ..and apologise. That's fine. You can tell me all about it later. Let's go. Come with me. What did you say? I'm ashamed... to be seen like this. Don't be. It's that old witch's fault this happened. I'm taking Kie. Write a statement of divorce. I'll come for it later. You're in the way! Move! All right, Kie... hold on tight. Hold onto me. She's ours! Where are you taking her? You listen to me! Kie trained as a maid with us for three and a half years. From my late mother... She learned housework and deportment... ..so she could go proudly as a bride into any house. It enrages me to see her... ..in a pitiful state like this! File a complaint if you wish. I'll protect her if it takes my sword to do it! Milksop! The basket, Naota! What are you doing? The chicken got away! Shino! I'm glad you came. Naota told me everything. Where is she? In the back room. What did the doctor say? That she's weak, but not badly ill. Really? He says with food and rest she'll be fine. Kie... It's me. Do you recognise me? You poor thing! You're so thin! We should have come sooner! No, don't get up. Just lay back and rest. I'll wipe her down. Heat some water. I already am. I'll get her one of Mother's robes. Where are they? I'll do it. Shino! I thought we could make her some chicken broth. Get busy! You can't feed her anything as oily as that now! Make some rice gruel. How do you make that? Boil a little rice in water. Kane, you do it. Munezo, heat me some water! Oh, yeah... Kume! Go somewhere out of the way! What can I do? You're in the way, too. What are you doing?! I'll do it. Don't let go! Kume, look in on Kie before you go to bed. I'll come back tomorrow. Sorry to keep you here this late. What's going to come of this? A samurai carrying a girl on his back... ..in broad daylight! People will talk. Here, Kie. This'll warm your feet. Tomorrow I'll go back to the Iseya... ..and settle everything. There's nothing to worry about. You just rest here. Think of this as your own home. All right? Hello... Hello! Is this Squire Katagiri's house? I'm Kie's sister. I've come to see her. Good day to you. In there. Sis? Bun! Pa asked me to come see you. You came all the way, and by yourself! I'm so glad you're all right! I was so worried! Who are you? What are you doing here? No, that's not necessary. Who are you, child? Do I seem such an ogre, then? That's a surprise to me. It's not that you're an ogre, sir. Samurai scare her. She's never seen one up close before. Why do we scare her? Because you carry swords. I grew up thinking that if I offended a samurai... ..he'd cut me down right there on the spot. That's just not so, Kie. A sword is something you hardly ever draw. I've never drawn mine except to tend to it. Is that the truth, sir? Of course! Killing is frightening, even for a samurai. That's something I've never heard before. So were you afraid of me when you first came here? My heart was pounding, sir. I thought I might die any moment. Is that really what you thought? And here my heart was pounding... ..over this young girl who'd come to our house. Is something wrong? I'm fooling with you, sir. Well, of all the nerve! Making fun of me! Can you imagine that, Naota? Now, that's a big mouth! See, Bun? Your sister's laughing. Watch your head! Naota! No sleeping late tomorrow, now. You've got to grow up right and make a good wife of yourself. Will you go as a bride again? No. I've learned my lesson. When I'm better, I'll just look after the master. I owe him my life, after all. Will you marry the master, then? No. The master and I are of different castes. Different what? 'Castes'. What does that mean? I don't really know. I've never thought about it before. Hello! Hello! Who's there? Who is it? It's me, Samon. There's trouble. Hazama's been sent down from Edo for plotting rebellion. He'll be caged here in the domain. Hazama? Caged? He was involved with some reformers inside the Shogunate. Senior Retainer Hori found out. Some got off with hara-kiri, but Hazama wasn't so lucky. He's on the Ou Highway now... ..being brought here in a prisoner's basket. When does he arrive? In two days. Who told you? My father. It's all being kept very secret. Anyone who talks is guilty of an offence. My father knows we were friends with Hazama... ..so he warned me. I was afraid he'd get into trouble down there... ..but I never thought he'd come home in a prisoner's basket! In 1861, Unasaka Clan samurai in Edo plotted against the Shogun. Fearing the Shogun would find out... ..the clan dealt with them in secret. Yaichiro Hazama was not allowed... ..the privilege of suicide. He was held in solitary confinement... ..'caged' in the clan's domain. Watch him! On your feet! Damn rebel! Let him rot here! Let's go. Is Squire Katagiri here? Katagiri! You're to report to the Head Overseer for questioning. The Head Overseer's here? He arrived by swift-palanquin from Edo yesterday. This must be about Hazama. What does Squire Katagiri have to do with him? You don't know? He and Hazama studied fencing under Master Toda. They were an even match. So is Squire Katagiri mixed up in this plot? Shh! Don't talk about that! You'll lose your head if you do! The head came off! Munezo Katagiri, of our Training Corps. I will begin. You know Yaichiro Hazama of our Edo Horse Guard... Tell the Senior Retainer of your connection, omitting nothing. We studied fencing together under Master Toda. We are brothers of the sword. "Toda"? Kansai Toda. Under our late Lord he surrendered samurai status... ..and became a farmer. Oh, that madman... So were you and Hazama... ..very close friends? May I enquire... ..of what crime Hazama stands accused? Silence! You will answer the questions you are asked! Such impertinence to the Head Overseer! 'Katagiri'...the son of Hanbei Katagiri? Yes, sir. He committed hara-kiri over the Goken River improvements. He has his father's insolence. Continue. I am told Hazama left in anger when Toda chose you over him... ..to learn the esoteric arts of his school called 'The Hidden Blade'. Is this true? I am sworn to silence about 'The Hidden Blade'. I beg your indulgence. Now, now. You won't get anywhere losing your temper. Katagiri... Who is the better swordsman, you or Hazama? Hazama, I would think. That's strange... You competed before His Lordship some years ago, and of three matches... ..you won two. Had we fought with real swords, Hazama would have won. All right, then. Have you received letters from him since he left three years ago? Two or three times, New Year's greetings and the like. Katagiri... Don't write this. Who among the retainers here is Hazama close to? You must know that. This is a list of those who have studied under Master Toda. Your name is among them. Tell us who else here is friendly with Hazama. I wouldn't know. And even if I did know... I could not say. And why not? A samurai does not inform on his fellows. Milord! No! This is important! I won't take this from a low-caste samurai! Remember to whom you speak! You insolent cur! Squire Hazama, time to eat. Squire? Welcome home, sir. Mother didn't teach you how to chop wood, did she. I'm just not strong enough. Spread your knees and hold the wood straight in front of you. Don't lift the wood into the air. Lift the axe, take aim... ..and bring it down. Hold the axe loosely, then put your weight behind it. Can you do that? Yes, sir. How was your work today? Why do you ask? You're so pale I thought perhaps something made you angry. Those things happen every day. One must bear them like a samurai. Um... Here. Thank you! But because one is a samurai there are things one must not bear! Excuse me... I've brought tea. I hate to interrupt your studies, but could I ask you to stand up? Why? I'd like to see how this kimono of your father's fits you. Your mother often said how it would suit you... ..and that she was going to adjust it for you. Why, it's perfect! The sleeves and the length. You could wear it just like that, sir. I guess I have my father's build. Do you resemble him in the face, too? No, not at all. My father had a face like a crab. When he got mad, the spit would fly. Nothing ever scared me like that. If he were alive, he'd be 60 now. You've heard what happened, haven't you? Yes... Father! There was a problem with the accounts for the Goken River bridge. My father took responsibility, and committed suicide. He left me a letter. 'I have not sinned...' '...but I live to obey my liege lord.' 'Though you be young, you are my son.' 'This you will understand.' It's a very sad thing. We were driven out of the big house we'd lived in... ..the very next day. So we came here. Our relatives would have nothing to do with us. Those were wretched days for my mother, Shino and me. Then you came along, a ruddy-faced girl... ..fresh off the farm. I didn't know how to behave, or how to speak properly... Mother certainly took a shine to you. She said you were brighter than Shino. She taught me everything I know. How to clean, lay up preserves, make miso... ..how to cook, sew... ..weave, grow flowers... ..calligraphy, poems... She taught you poems? She spelled them out so I could practice them. What poems? Different ones. Chant one for me. Oh, I couldn't! Your master commands it. Well, all right. 'Methinks you hunt by morn...' 'Methinks you ride now to the hunt...' 'The sound of your catalpawood bow...' '...comes to me...' You have a beautiful voice. Keep singing! No! Even if your master asks? All right. 'You who rules this land...' 'By morn...' '...you caress me...' Hey! 'At eve you stand by me...' Kume! Kume! Go take your bath. 'I hear the sound...' '...of the golden string...' '...of your catalpawood bow...' Once again! Eyes...... Left! As you were! Why can you not move 'click-click!' on my order? If you retainers cannot... ..however will you instruct the foot soldiers? Sensei, why do we have to move 'click-click!' like that? As I have explained... Before a gun crew is instructed in artillery... ..it must learn to respond 'click-click!' to orders. That is the reason for this drill. We will move on to marching. Front rank, forward, march! No, no, no, no! Left foot forward, then swing the opposite arm! Like so! What's so funny? What?! This is the new English style of walking! Now you try it. Front rank, forward, march! Squire Katagiri! Swing your right arm as you raise your left foot. Why can't you people do this?! Right! Left! Right! Left! Don't make me say this again! Swing your arms, and you will naturally run much faster. You first five, on my order, please run. Ready“. Run! What's wrong with that, Sensei? You'll get shot if you don't run faster than that! I thought we were running pretty fast... All right, we'll compare. We'll have a race. You're on! You run in your old samurai style, and I will run in the new English way. Go get 'im! Ready? Run! Faster! Go! Quick! Go on! Go! Squire Hirota, are you all right?! Where's the Sensei? He's tired. He's laying down in his room. I feel sorry for him, you know. An instructor from Edo... Up here shouting at us bumpkins all day... We should take him into Mugiyamachi for a drink. Good idea! We'll set him up with a girl. Through for the day? Aye. Well, I'll be on my way. Leaving already? Katagiri's not very sociable lately. Always rushing off home. He's got a sweet little maid waiting there for him. That's right. The lucky dog! Left foot, right arm! Een, twee! Halt! About turn! Forward, march! Not like that! So what's on your mind? Captain Takamine called me to his house the other day. He's looking for a husband for his youngest girl... ..and asked if I might know of anyone. I suggested you. I've met her twice. She's a nice girl. No, thanks. I don't need the trouble. I'm fine as I am. Fool! You don't have to say no. He already did. And that's not all. He gave me hell for my effrontery in suggesting you... ..as a husband for his precious daughter. Why did he do that? Don't you understand? Your father had to commit suicide. His son took the young Iseya wife, and keeps her like a mistress. My father did nothing wrong! And there are many who sympathised with him. But what about Kie? It's caused talk among the retainers. My parents take it out on Shino. She was in tears last night. The poor thing... I speak as your friend... Do something about Kie. Do what? That's up to you. But things can't go on as they are. I have to hear this from you, too? There is nothing to provoke scandal between Kie and me. She is a kind and good-natured girl. I know that very well! That's why I'm telling you this! You won't listen to sense! Have you ever seen the sea? No. I've dreamed about seeing it all my life. I'm off-duty tomorrow. Shall we take a lunch and go? Really? You'll really take me to the sea? Yes. I'm so glad! It's been a while now since you came back. You're healthy again. It's about time you went home... ..to your parents. I've been happy to take advantage of having you with me... ..what with you knowing our house so well... ..but that can't go on forever. Being with you, and taking care of you... ..suits me very well, sir. Can we not go on as we are? No. We can't do that. Why not? You are young, bright... ..good-natured and beautiful. You need to find a hard-working man who will cherish you. Have children. Be happy. I've no intention of marrying again. I've learned my lesson. Rather than suffer that again... I'd much rather sit watching you... ..eating the food I've made you with a hearty appetite... ..and studying late into the night. If that doesn't please you... I've never said that. Then would you allow me to stay with you... ..until you find a wife? I don't know when that will be. That's fine by me. You have your own life to live! You can't waste it as my maid! So Kie... Go home. Is that... ..what you wish, sir? Yes. That is my command. All right. Then I have no choice but to obey. Thank you very much for all you have done for me. Got one! You did? A Manual of Infantry Training. Kume, could you come here? Now, the unlined summer kimonos are in the top drawer of the chest... ..and the winter ones are in the bottom drawer. Socks are down here. Every so often make sure... ..to look at his socks. There might be holes in them, and he won't care. Don't forget to turn the preserves so the rice-bran doesn't go off. It'll be rainy season soon. Turn the tatami mats. And always watch the fire. Don't burn the place down. I'd meant to take Kie back to her parents' home... But when I got up the next morning... ..she had gone away on her own. Squire Hazama, time to eat. Squire? Is he dead? Squire? Give me the key or I'll break your arm! All right! Killer on the loose! Halt! Assistance! Assistance! What? He's dead! Take his feet! Squire Katagiri is here. Something serious has happened. Yaichiro Hazama has escaped. As you know, he is very skilled, and crafty as any snake. He has barricaded himself in a peasant family's hut... ..and is holding them hostage. Behind him is a range of very high mountains. It's impossible for him to flee across them. And he doesn't mean to try. We know this because he had the guard... ..bring a letter to Senior Retainer Hori. 'I will neither run nor hide.' 'Send a force against me.' 'One by one I will cut them down...' '...until I have built a mountain of corpses.' What pure gall! The Senior Retainer is furious. Even weakened by long imprisonment, Hazama is still... ..the best swordsman in the clan. He would injure or even kill foot soldiers. That is why your name came up. You are the only one who can cut Hazama down. By doing that... ..you will erase any suspicion that you have plotted with him. Go out and face him. Those are the words of the Senior Retainer. Well? Will you do it? I am being ordered to kill an old friend? If you do not, you will be considered in league with him. Well? Will you do it or not? Is this an order? Yes. It is the order of your clan. I understand. I will go. Very good. I'll report this to the Senior Retainer. We'll dispatch a squad of riflemen today, as well. Make your preparations tonight. An official will call in the morning. Good luck. Toda sensei... Forgive my neglect of you. Are you well? Munezo Katagiri... Yes. It's been a long time. Something worries you. What is it? Would you remember a man named Hazama? We studied together. Yaichiro Hazama... It has come about that I must face him in combat. In a fight to the death... You against Hazama.. I always thought that this would happen someday. Everyone tenses when swords are drawn. You can tell a man to stay calm, but he won't. He is tense in body and mind. There's no help for it. Now... Try to make your body relax. Go loose. Concentrate on parrying. If he attacks, step back. He will grow angry. That is your aim. But while the body retreats, the spirit does not. The spirit is always attacking. I yield. Now let me show you something. Come at me. I will. I yield. Once more. Unlike 'The Devil's Claw', which I taught you long ago... ..this is meant for use in a real swordfight. It's a dangerous trick. Be ready to die. I thank you. Take your eyes off your opponent... ..and turn your back. Will I really be able to do a crazy thing like that? Hello? A woman... I'll go. Who is it? I'm sorry to bother you this late at night. Is this the home of Squire Munezo Katagiri? Yes. I am he. Do you remember me? I am Yaichiro Hazama's wife. I have a favor to ask concerning my husband. Please, come in. No. It's not seemly for me to be calling on you at all. I'll just sit here, if I may. How may I help you? I'm told he has fled from his cell. The man is truly hopeless. I was always afraid something like this would happen. You have my sympathy. I'm also told you have been chosen to stand against him. It is an order from the clan. I have no choice. When will you go? Tomorrow morning. Could you possibly let him escape? Escape? Over the mountains lies Ugo. My husband was born there, in Satake. He can survive there somehow. You ask the impossible. He intends to kill whoever is sent after him, and then to die himself. If an old friend like you were to reason with him... ..that wouldn't happen. You know him well. If he lives he will become a powerful man. It will not hurt your prospects then if he is in your debt. Madam, please! My gain or loss is of no consequence. If you wish... I will offer myself to you. Whenever you say the word. You mustn't say things like that! Hazama has made this a fight to the death. He will die, or I will. Our lives are both at stake. I will forget what you've said. Please do the same. You're an honest man, just as my husband said. I'm sorry to have disturbed you so late. Good night. Let me give you a light for your lantern. The road is dark. Take care. I'll go to Lord Hori, the Senior Retainer. The Senior Retainer? Why? I'll ask him to order you not to kill Hazama. No! You can't trust him! You'll be wasting your time. I know that. Madam! Don't! Naota, I'm going to write a letter. If I die tomorrow... ..take it to Kie for me. Understand? Take the letter to Kie. Aye. Thank you for coming, sir. That house? Aye. There's a lot of smoke coming from it. It looks like he's eating all the rice they've got. The old man's come out. Poor old Kamezo! Hazama's holding the old man and his grand-daughter hostage. He's got a sword he's holding on the girl... ..so our hands are tied. Would you like to watch for a while? I'll get ready and go. How long should we wait? We have orders to shoot, even if it means killing the hostages. No. I'll have it settled by dark. If I'm not back by sunset, the rest is in your hands. Yes, sir. Well, if it isn't Katagiri! They sent you after me? Let me talk to you. Go in. Are you well? How do you think I'd be... ..locked in a dark cell on two bowls of gruel of day? Let's not waste words. I guess you're right. So what are you here to do? Kill me? Commit suicide, as a samurai should. I'll be your second. And if I say no? Then I must... ..kill you. The clan orders it. The clan! Hori sent you, didn't he. 'Go kill that rebel, ' he said. Aye. That meddlesome old fool! This isn't the time to argue about opening up to the foreigners or not. What we're doing is for the clan, and for the country! There's nothing disloyal about it! The one who should be struck down is Hori... ..who cares only for filling his own pockets. He's the traitor! Hazama... What? There are riflemen all around this house. You'll never get out of here alive. So they're going to kill me with guns, are they? Hey... I'm sure you haven't forgotten, four years ago before His Lordship. I lost to you. 'Hazama lost to Katagiri, ' they said. 'Serves him right!' The whole clan laughed at me. But... I was holding back. If I'd meant to, I could have smashed your skull wide open. I didn't because it was before His Lordship. I knew that. You did? Fine, then! We'll settle accounts with real swords now. Those bastards will think again when I kill you. I am the best swordsman in the Unasaka Clan! Draw! Some farmer'd had this hidden for years. It's rusty, but it still cuts. Use your head, will you? If you kill yourself according to the law, you keep your honor. Killing you in a fight will keep me my honor. Wait! Think of your wife! If you don't kill yourself, she'll be the wife of a criminal! I've told her to cut her throat and follow me. You don't have to fret over that. Cut her throat? Why make her do a thing like that? Since when is my wife of concern to you? Draw! Draw, will you! You always were good at getting out of the way. Do you insist, Hazama? Have you ever killed a man? No. I've killed several, in Edo. Just to try my hand. Hurry! What? Why don't you attack? Are you afraid? Are you going to use 'The Hidden Blade'? That 'Devil's Claw' trick that Toda-sensei taught you? He should have passed that down to me! Come on, then. Show me 'The Devil's Claw'. If that's how you mean to kill me... ..then try. 'The Devil's Claw' isn't something you use in a swordfight. And I didn't learn it to use on you! Damn you! Enough of this! Kill yourself! After I kill you! What, you're running? What was that? 'The Devil's Claw'? No. That wasn't 'The Devil's Claw'. That was a coward's trick. I'll kill you! Wait! Hold your fire! Hazama! Hazama... I'm sorry! You wouldn't have wanted... ..to die by the gun! I'm very sorry. I pray you will not hate me. I have some things to tell you of how your husband met his end... ..but first I must report to the Senior Retainer. I'll take my leave. Squire Katagiri... ..did the Senior Retainer not tell you to spare my husband? What?! He promised me he would. You really went to the Senior Retainer's home last night? And he told you he would spare Hazama? You've been a fool! I told you not to go! I knew that would happen! He said nothing to me. You've been deceived. Here they are. He was standing at the front door. I had to drag him in here. Well, here you are! Well done! I was sure you'd beat him. No, it was the new guns that got me out of a tight spot. Oh, you used the guns? We'd never used them on a man before. They're very effective. Far better than matchlocks. They were expensive, but I guess they're worth it. Katagiri, come here. We'll drink a pledge. This man has just killed a samurai in a duel. His opponent was the greatest swordsman in the Unasaka clan! That's awful! We'd certainly like to hear about it, but this is not the time. You may greet the Senior Retainer and withdraw. There'll be a reward for you. Hey! I said you may leave. I have something to ask the Senior Retainer. What? Did you receive a visit last night from Hazama's wife? How did you know that? Hazama's wife came to my house last night. She said she was going to see you. Yes. She did. She's beautiful... ..so they say. She is. I wondered what she wanted so late at night... ..but as she was so attractive, I brought her here and heard her out. What did she want? His life. She asked me to order Katagiri to let Hazama escape. Imagine a criminal's wife asking such a thing! Out of the question! So you refused? Of course. But, Koda, she was very beautiful. She turned her charm on me, and I couldn't say no. What man could resist a woman like that? So you and the lady... Yes. I enjoyed her to the full, there in the next room. But sir, I received no order from you... ..to let Hazama escape. Of course not! She knew very well she was asking the impossible. As proof of that, she enjoyed herself immensely. A fine body she has, too. And? What is it you wish to say? Senior Retainer or not... ..to take advantage of a wife pleading for her husband's life... ..was a foul thing to do. To Hazama's wife! You presume upon my kind words to you. I did what she wanted! Your impertinence knows no end! I'll deal with you later! Fool! Sir! I wanted to see Hazama's wife and tell her not to be rash... ..and that life was a treasure not to be lightly discarded... ..but I was too late. Square formation! Prepare to resist cavalry! Fall in! Right turn! Forward, march! Not a damned drop! Go on! You bother me! After all the money I've paid that quack! Damn it! Katagiri? What do you want? Sir? Sir! What's wrong?! Are you ill? Sir? Sir! What's wrong? Don't move him! Bring the doctor! Doctor! Hurry, please! Doctor! Help him! Well, Doctor? It's as if something's been sent straight through his heart. Certainly this wound is the cause of death. How could that happen without any bleeding? Yes... what caused the wound? Could it have been... ..something other than human, perhaps? I wouldn't move him. Inside he's probably a sea of blood. I have taken vengeance for you and for Hazama. May you rise to Buddha. But why... ..do I feel so empty? What will I do now? I resigned my position and abandoned my samurai status. I never want to kill again. I'll leave you here. Ezo... that's a long way to go. You poor man...all alone in that wilderness! If only you had a wife to go with you! Shimada...take good care of this crybaby, will you? We'll be fine. Don't you worry about us. Is this the last we'll ever see of you? Shino, I'm going. Goodbye. Sis! A visitor! The Master! Oh, my! How have you been, Kie? What brings you here? And why are you dressed like that? Are you going on a journey? Or maybe Kyoto? Are you going to Edo? Now, now, calm down. That's why I've come to see you. Let's sit over there. Is farm work hard? We're about to start planting, so it's the busiest time of the year. But compared to the Iseya, with that old witch yelling at me... ..and working so hard until I had no time to eat... ..this is nothing. It's child's play. I see... I'm sorry about coming to talk to you at such a busy time... What is it? Have you made any arrangements for a marriage? My father's brought any number of offers... But you haven't accepted any? It so happens... I'm going to the island of Ezo. Ezo? Way up north? I'm sick of being a samurai. I've renounced my status. I'm a townsman now. I'm thinking of going into trade in Ezo. How long will it take you to get there? A month, two if the seas are rough. But then I'll never be able to see you again! Kie... Will you come with me? There's no hardship I can't bear if I'm with you. That's what I've come here to say. Will you be my wife? Well... this is all so sudden... There's nothing stopping us. If I love you, and you love me, that's all we need. And I love you. I always have..ever since I first saw you. Kie... What do you think? I've never ever given it a thought! Would you give it a thought now? Well? Have you thought about it? Is that... ..what you wish, sir? Yes. That is my command. Then I have no choice but to obey. Directed by Yoji Yamada
