[man] The ball is my life. It gave me everything. It made me who I am. I owe everything to soccer. Since my first day with Juventus my teammates welcomed me. I felt like a member of a family. I believe that the ball is something we have to tame. As soon as it touches my foot it belongs to Juventus. If we treat it well we will succeed. [theme music playing] [narrator] It's early fall. Serie A is resuming after a short break for the nationals. With six wins and one draw, Juve is still undefeated. But Coach Max Allegri knows that his team must keep improving to keep up with the leading teams. Guys, today we are looking at things we did right and things we did wrong. [man] We need to play between the lines, behind their players. Our defenders need to have more courage going forward, going... [man] They need to be more proactive. In this situation... Fast forward a bit... As the ball comes back, Cuadrado shouldn't stand still, he should move up to shorten the field. Matuidi should be here and Claudio a bit forward. It should be the opposite. Claudio should be out and this one in. Here we need: Higuain, Matuidi and Douglas Costa. We need to attack the area all together. [Allegri] We work hard on technical and tactical stuff, but, above all, on the improvement of individual players. [Allegri] Wait a second! Mario! From there, you have to move outside! Let's do it right! [Allegi] And maintain the order! [Miralem Pjanic] Allegri is someone who... who is obsessed with victory. He prepares us to win every single match. Gonzalo, I want a good, solid, ten minutes! Ready to go there! When he sees the team sitting or resting on their laurels he is always able to find a catchphrase, a particular thing that makes all of them react. [Torricelli] I think this is his greatest quality. This proves that we are too haughty, we think we're too good and we don't have to improve! We have to pay attention to these details! [Allegri] These things drive me nuts! [narrator] Juve's next Serie A match is against Lazio. A team they lost to at the end of last season in the Super Coppa. To better prepare, Allegri invites an amateur team to simulate Lazio's style of play. [Murriero] I am Marco Murriero, and I am the goalkeeper of Calcio Derthona. Our team plays in Serie D, the amateur national league. [Murriero] Today we had a practice game against Juventus since they will play against Lazio on Saturday. We had the honor to help them prepare for this important match. [narrator] The primary concern for Juventus has been their inability to stay focused for an entire match. We have everything under control, the team plays very well... ...but then we start to lose a little bit of concentration and if you play against a team like Lazio, who is very strong in my opinion, they will kill you. Out, out! Go get it! C'mon! [narrator] When the night of the match comes, Gigi Buffon and his teammates are confident. But Lazio's striker Ciro Immobile wants to take his personal revenge. After playing in Juve's youth team, the strong Neapolitan forward was sent away. -Coach: Massimiliano... -[crowd] Allegri! -Number one: Gianluigi... -[crowd] Buffon! -[commentator] Number three: Giorgio... -[crowd] Chiellini! -Number six: Sami... -[crowd] Khedira! -Number 17: Mario... -[crowd] Mandzukic! [commentator] Under way! Let's go, guys! Till the end! Lazio plays first, in goal as number one, they have Strakosha. Matuidi sprints, he creates a hole in the center... Then Asamoah gets in and kicks out outside to Mandzukic. Douglas Costa starts from the other side, good passage for Kwadwo, watch out... Back cross for Khedira and great save from Strakosha! Empty net and it's goal! Scored by Douglas Costa! Juve one, Lazio zero! Khedira has space, he looks up, he wants to shoot but changes his mind, Khedira! Great extension by Strakosha. The goalie is challenged by Gonzalo's attack. Watch out, it hits the crossbar! What a mistake. Strakosha was about to fail big time. Juventus is putting tremendous pressure on Lazio. Watch out, Luis Alberto in a one vs one, Immobile... Goal, Lazio ties. Once again it's him, Ciro Immobile brings the team to a tie at the 46th minute. Higuain in front of the goal, strikes! Strakosha pushes it clear! Strakosha! They're confident... Watch out! Immobile, opportunity to score, he dribbles Buffon and he is down. A penalty kick for Lazio, unbelievable! He definitely didn't touch him with his legs, maybe with his arm, but Ciro Immoble was already about to fall. Ciro will take the penalty, watch out for Gigi. Recently, Gigi is very good on the right side. Everybody is out of the penalty area. Buffon is very focused. Immobile is carefree. Immobile shoots, and Buffon picks the right side. Two, one, 53rd minute. Juventus one, Lazio two. [narrator] On the verge of their first home loss after 41 matches in two years, Juve scrambles to attack. Allegri finally makes the fans' most anticipated substitution, letting Paulo Dybala in. Bianconeri's number ten has been red-hot this season, scoring eight goals in his first four matches, including two hat tricks. [commentator] Replaced by the number ten, La Joya, Paulino Dybala. Matuidi to Dybala. Dybala left kick, Dybala hits the goalpost! Watch out, Nani on to Buffon, Caicedo! Buffon saves them from a three-to-one. Asamoah crosses, it's deflected. Header from Bentancur, he finds Higuain, to Bernardeschi! This is a penalty kick! Referee! Mazzoleni! Mazzoleni! No, come on, guys. No, no, no. There's something wrong here. This is a clear penalty kick. It's a penalty kick. Yellow card for Patric. [narrator] With no time left on the clock, Dybala has one last chance to tie the match. [commentator] Paolino about to shoot... Strakosha saves! Lazio conquers Allianz Stadium. The first team to win against Juventus this season. [reporter] The other day, Barzagli said that you have often trouble staying focused. Would you agree? Thank you. I believe that focus is not our problem. It's understanding the dangers within the match. Sometimes it feels like it's just too easy due to our skills. I don't say this to be presumptuous, but to be honest. [Chiellini] I say this with respect to Lazio, who deserved to win, they are great players, but there's a huge gap in skills between our teams. And sometimes it feels too easy. As soon as you start losing that fear, that healthy fear, you can lose to anyone. [Chiellini] Losing is tough, but losing at home is much harder. But in my opinion, these defeats we suffer now must be the catalyst that will push us to win in May. [Chiellini] Victory may be a burden for some, but for us it is an obsession. [Dybala] In order to miss a penalty kick, you need enough courage to kick one. [narrator] It has been 15 years since Juventus' home defeat against Lazio. It's an extraordinary event that reverberates all across Italy. And on television, the comedy program Striscia la Notizia takes no mercy on the fallen. -[Staffelli]] Sir Chiellini, how are you? -[Chiellini] Come in. [Staffelli] ] Are you alone? Ah no, the usual foursome! Since you are not at your best, I am giving you the Golden Tapir for good luck. [Staffelli]The Golden Tapir is an award from Striscia la Notizia, a comedy show on his 30th birthday this year. And Juve said: "You shall not pass!" This is what defense should say! It's an award that we give to who has an eccentric, odd behavior, or their hand in the cookie jar. How did you feel when Dybala missed such an important penalty kick? Gigi is a friend, he knows how to handle jokes and was very good on answering the question about the missed penalty kick. I think that my teammate was brave to take such an important kick. I prefer to look at the bright side of life. What a philosopher! If I'm born again, I want to be Sir Buffon. Me, too! If I'm born again, I want to be myself again. You should've said you want to be Staffelli! You expected him to say he wanted to be you, right? I knew he wouldn't. It is not easy to be 40 years old in these physical and mental conditions. [Buffon] In the end, it is all about fate. Everything has a beginning and an end. [Daniele Rugani] Playing with Buffon is an honor. Sometimes I don't even know how to behave with him since I see him as a sacred figure. [Rugani] A player like that is obviously... a legend. I admired him when I was growing up and playing with him now is incredible. [narrator] Playing for Juve comes with many perks... Among them, the opportunity to pop to Paris for a sponsored obligation, on a private jet. The ex-Milan Mattia De Sciglio and the Colombian Juan Cuadrado are no strangers to international notoriety, also because they both play for their national teams. But rock star treatment is something different. [Sciglio] We are flying to Paris for the opening of Adidas' new soccer store, where we'll meet the Tango League guys. We are hoping to meet many Juventus fans, they are everywhere in the world. And to find nice clothes so we can get something for ourselves. -[Sciglio] Where is Armero playing now? -[Cuadrado] Brazil. -[Sciglio] In Brazil? -[Cuadrado] Bahia. [narrator] The Tango League players are some of the best young footballers in France. But the Juventus players represent an entirely different level of celebrity. Very good. -[photographer] Here. -[Cuadrado] Here? [photographer] And you, you're gonna be here. -Where are you going? -You sign here. -[man] These are for you. -[Cuadrado] Okay. -[man]You should sit there. -[Cuadrado] I sit here? [man] Yes. We are going downstairs, sign some autographs, take some pictures and leave. -Thank you. -You're welcome. [reporter] You both played for big teams. What makes Juve different? One difference is the tradition of this club, for sure, therefore we play better and with more joy on the field. Do you prefer winning the World Cup or the Champions League? Champions League. [narrator] To rank the Champions' League ahead of the World Cup may be surprising. But this shows how badly the Bianconeri want to win this trophy: the so-called "big ears cup". After last month's crushing loss to Barcelona, to qualify, they must defeat Sporting Lisbon at Allianz Stadium, tonight. [Medhi Benatia] Sporting likes to play like the Spanish teams. After the first game lost with Barcelona, we can't lose another game, so we have to be really concentrated. [commentator] Everything is ready for this big Champions League game The team that Coach Allegri is putting on the field tonight is very strong offensively. This is the first leg of a head-to-head, so a must-win. Kick off... till the end of the first half, go Juve! Here is the first touch. Alex Sandro, next to Martins, tries one on one, but Martins wins. Almost Alex Sandro's foul. Fernandes ends up keeping the ball. Martins escapes! Alone before Buffon, a miracle! No, own goal by Alex Sandro, unbelievable! No! Sporting Club is ahead one to zero after 11 minutes. Gigi's despair. [narrator] Alex Sandro's own goal 12 minutes into the match, puts Juve in a psychological hole. [commentator] Coach Allegri is going to get really mad now. Dybala, one more time! Left-footed shot! And it's out. The audience is cheering the team. Come on, guys, go! Watch out... Alex Sandro again. Alex Sandro crosses to Mandzukic! Manduzkic's header. Pjanic heads again, gets hit really hard! Free kick, referee, this is worth a yellow card! That was a hard hit! Pjanic! Hits and goal... Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! [narrator] Sporting would be happy to come away with a draw, so they take their gloves off. [commentator] Watch out, referee! This is yellow card. Another huge foul on Mandzukic! Sturaro passes the ball to Cuadrado... who is taken down by Fernandes' fouls while pressing. Dybala... Referee calls no foul, surprisingly. [narrator] Sporting's strategy is brutal, but effective. The score is still one to one with ten minutes left. [commentator] Let's stay ahead, guys. Be strong, go for it. Heart and technique above all. Alex Sandro, from the opposite side, Douglas Costa. Douglas Costa cross kicks and it's goal... Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Douglas Costa splits the match! The ram rips the gate off! Another goal in Europe! Mario Mandzukic! [Allegri] The strength of a team is to remain calm in good times and bad. We can't just get excited when things are good and depressed when they are bad. I always say: "It needs balance." A great team must have balance. And at the end, people will only judge us by the final score. So I know that the score is all that matters. [narrator] Juventus' win against Sporting, even if difficult, was the only acceptable outcome. Even when they are missing one of their midfield key players Claudio Marchisio, one of the team's most authoritative 'senators,' is ready to play again, after struggling for more than a year to recover from a torn left knee ligament. A Turin native, 31-years-old Marchisio was raised in Juventus' youth sector. He started playing with Juventus' jersey when he was just seven years old. Well, my career started when I was very young, in 1993. I tried out for Juventus here in Turin and made it. [Marchisio] My career stated there. And now that I'm 31 years old, I have realized my childhood dream. Just in time! Okay. I use moka so the coffee is really nice and intense. Not everybody uses it because people are more and more in a hurry. A real coffee in Italy is made like this! When I come back home, usually the house is quiet because the kids haven't come home from school yet. My wife is out running errands so I can have a moment for myself with a nice coffee. I either read a book or watch TV. Growing up in Juventus's world taught me since I was a kid, to be a man first and a player second. I see you! [Marchisio] Come here! I'm coming to get you! [Marchisio] This is where our winning attitude begins, the idea of sacrificing yourself for every practice, for your teammates, to reach your common goal, that is to win together, because there is no "I" in "team". [Marchisio] I'm not sure if Santa will come this year. You weren't very good. -Were you? -[child] Yes. -[Marchisio] Are you sure? -[child] Yes. Tell me something good you did, this year. See, you don't know. [Marchisio] In your career, you have to take in account that there might be some setbacks. I had this injury and it hasn't been easy. But when you are not playing, you might notice things that you can't tell on the field. Let's see. Do this... Oh, it's growing. And there is another one here. Look at this one! It's moving. I miss playing very much. I hope I'll never have to sit out again. So not only will Santa come, but also the Tooth Fairy. [narrator] In early November, Juventus celebrates their 120th anniversary by wearing old-fashioned jerseys without names on the back to commemorate generations of mythology written in black and white. From North to South, everybody love Juventus, unless they hate it. So they hate it or they love it, as we say today: "It's a matter of black and white." We say, "There are no stronger colors than black and white." [Bettega] It looks almost easy, that new players arrive and suddenly the quality of champions is passed onto them. Could it be that this quality is passed onto them by history itself? [commentator] Brothers and sisters, welcome to the Allianz Stadium, 120 years in 12 days, happy birthday Juventus! The choices are made, there is no turning back now. [narrator] Juventus' anniversary match is being played against Benevento, which is in last place in Serie A. Claudio Marchisio is finally ready to test his knee on the pitch. And the goalkeeper matchup is intriguing: for Juve Buffon will rest, giving his backup Wojciech Szczensy a rare start. And for Benevento, Alberto Brignoli is playing with a personal edge. He is on loan from Juventus. [commentator] The ball goes above the goalkeeper, who deflects it... Brignoli. Douglas gets it inside, the goalkeeper deflects the ball on the post, unbelievable! Shoots the corner back. Marchisio shoots and misses! Claudio Marchisio... But the linesman raised the flag. Too bad, great shot. Rugani's header, but Ciciretti is free, foul. Watch out, Ciciretti shoots... and it's goal. Benevento scores, incredible! [narrator] Shockingly, last-place Benevento, after 11 consecutive losses, has struck first. Now Juventus must find a way to equalize. [commentator] Higuain on the edge of the area... Ball deflection, Cuadradro shoots! Another deflection. Miraculous block by Benevento! Good move in the midfield from Higuain, ball to Dybala... Dybala, Dybala! Dybala gets in the penalty area and shoots! Brignoli, miraculous! Cross... Brignoli clears it! Cuadrado gets the ball. Cuadrado double step, Cuadrado in the penalty area, Cuadrado shoots with his right foot, Brignoli! Empty net, Higuain... deflection, Brignoli miraculous. Nothing goes in, nothing! To score today, we have to shoot seven times! [narrator] Brignoli is playing the match of his life which only inspires Juve to raise its game. [commentator] At Juan's feet. De Sciglio runs to the end zone, crosses over Brignoli. Backward header... Higuain, goal... Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Alex Sandro again crosses the ball. He touches it with his shoe, and...goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Goal! Juan... Guillermo... Cuadrado! Juan Guillermo! Two to one. Time's over. [narrator] Szczesny contributed to victory by defending the goal. But that doesn't mean that Juventus is ready to turn the page on the Buffon era. In the locker room, and in public appearances, their great captain is still the heart and soul of the team. Are you angry? No, I am not. [cameraman] Is everything under control? Everything is under control, I am focused. When will you stop playing? Probably this year. [cameraman] What will you do? Maybe something outside of soccer, like becoming a singer? [sings] [cameraman] Nice voice, you are in tune. I even sing in the church choir... [cameraman] How do you see yourself in 30 years? In 30 years? First of all I see myself alive! Given that in 30 years I'll be 70! [cameraman] Okay. Can you tell us a joke? Well, there is... No, I can't tell this joke. Somebody will get offended and it'll cause drama. You see what it means to be wiser, be more aware and adult? Never would I think about being cautious 10 or 15 years ago. [cameraman] The day after... Exactly. [cameraman] When was the last time you cried? I cry often and I cry alone. Crying helps, it frees you and make you feel human. [cameraman] After a defeat is crying important? I never cry for soccer... -[cameraman] Really? Never happened? -Not for a specific defeat. I can be touched, but it's not about the defeat itself, it's something more complex and romantic. -Thank you, guys. -[cameraman] Thank you. [narrator] Whether or not he actually retires from Juventus this spring, Buffon has already made plans to play for Italy his sixth World Cup this summer. One of his many records. Until the unthinkable happens. [commentator] And the full time whistle is blown in Milan, a historic humiliation for Italy. There will be a World Cup in Russia next summer, and there will be no Italian persons there. [narrator] Managing only a tie against Sweden, Italy's national team was eliminated from the 2018 World Cup. A disaster that has not happend for half a century. Buffon, Barzagli and Chiellini may never have another chance to play in the World Cup. A week after the elimination, even the tough Giorgio Chiellini, like all Italians, is simply trying to move on. We are headed to visit the basketball national team for their pre-game training session. Tomorrow they are playing their first qualifying match for their World Cup. I've always had a great love for basketball. -[Chiellini] Hey, are you okay? -Yeah, don't worry. Sit with us for five minutes. Do you know Carlo Recalcati? [Chiellini] Well, you know, it's a shame, on an emotional level it was a big letdown. Also, I'm 33 now, so that was my last World Cup. It's tough... People who understand sports know that these things happen. But when you put your heart and soul into it, it's hard to swallow. Sometimes only a painful defeat can give us the strength to reset everything and start over with more energy. [Allegri] C'mon, with strength! Like that! [narrator] As Juventus heads into the most difficult stretch of the early season, serious doubts are mounting. In the Champions League, they simply cannot lose another game, if they want to advance to the next round. And in the Serie A, their path to the seventh consecutive Scudetto will be increasingly difficult as they trail both Napoli and Inter in the standing. [Allegri] C'mon! Give 100%! Faster... [narrator] And Juve is facing a new reality: there has been no turbulence in the goal for 16 years, but Gigi Buffon has sat out two games in a row, and change appears inevitable. Heading into their most difficult stretch of games, there is a new question, not just who will play goalie next year, but who might be ready to step in next week.
