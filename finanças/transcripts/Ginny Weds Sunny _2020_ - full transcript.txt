DEDICATED TO THE LOVING MEMORY OF MY MOTHER, LATE SMT. SHANTIDEVI NETFLIX PRESENTS Simply delicious. -You have a great talent. -Papa, don't patronize me. -I'm already making you some. -Who's patronizing? -You're a good cook, Sunny. -Oh, really? Give me the shop if you like my cooking so much. -Let me open a restaurant. -It's all yours. -I'm not stopping you. -Give it. -Take charge. -Give it! Get married and it's yours. -What would I get out of marriage? -Some sense like everybody else. I'll be ready after I meet Sanya. Don't back out when it's time to hand over the keys. All talk and no action. It all depends on whether she says yes. You should be ashamed, Papa. You think my in-laws will give me a dowry to cover the expenses of my restaurant? How can I expect you to get a dowry when no one's giving you their daughter? I'm ready to give them a dowry if they agree to marry you. So tell me, should I book Noor Mahal for next month? What's Noor Mahal? It's our destination wedding venue. -A wedding venue? -It's a great place. You'll be mesmerized by it. Okay. But don't you think... We should spend a little more time, get to know each other? We'll have our whole lives for that. Let's get married. Once I get my restaurant, we can run our lives and restaurant, together. You want to marry so you can open your restaurant? Not just mine... ours. Papa will make you a partner. But I don't want to marry like this. Alright, how do you want to get married? Look, Sunny, you're a really nice guy. I mean, I really like meeting you, chilling with you. But I think we should see each other for at least a year and then we should take a decision. You want to get married after a year? If you fulfill your boyfriend duties, then yes. What if you think I haven't? No marriage. Your parents didn't name you right. -What do you mean? -Your name should have been Gita. -Why? -"Do your duties. Forget the results." How do you expect me to invest a year without guaranteed returns? Returns? Why don't you invest in Mutual Funds if you want guaranteed returns? You won't do well in relationships. CONFUSION: YOU SEEM TO BE IN A BAD MOOD? I'M ALWAYS HAPPY WHEN YOU'RE AROUND. -BRUNCH@SUTRA? I'LL PICK YOU UP AT 11? -YES. Is Didi here? No, Mama. It's Sunday. Go back to sleep. She is late again. Call her up and ask her to come immediately. -Why? -We are expecting guests. What guests? MATCHMAKER SHOBHA JUNEJA RISHTE HI RISHTE Ginny, you may speak to Pawan privately in the next room. It's better here, Mama. I might lose control if we are alone. He's so handsome. She's kidding. She is very modest. Please have some. A look at Pawan and I've lost all modesty, Mama. Pawan is the boy... I want to marry. Chips! Thank you. I have three conditions. I wouldn't even mind four. In fact, four is my lucky number. -Isn't it, Mom? -Let me finish. So, the first condition: We'll have an agreement that you won't force me to have a child. I'll have a child when I think I'm ready. You'll have a full medical check-up. I've heard you frequent Bangkok. And if the results are clean, I would like to test-drive Pawan. He has the body of sports car, but what if it's a lemon under the hood? It could ruin my life. Let's begin with the third condition tonight. We'll discuss the other two later. Right, Mom? -Ginny, stop! -Didi. -Yes, ma'am. -Stop. Stop or I'll overdose on sleeping pills. They aren't strong enough to make you sleep. They won't kill you. What's wrong with the boy I've chosen? This is the kind of boy you choose. You bring a cow pie and I'm to eat it like cake? You don't like him? I'll find another. Mama, I've told you, I want to have a love marriage. With whom? Nishant? Don't rub it in. -Didi, some water. -Anyone but him! I'll run away if you bring another tool like him. Tool? Can you not chew with your mouth closed like a normal person? If you must go out do it after you're married. Will do. Now, send the Bangkok biscuit back where it came from. Ginny! Ginny, stop! What's up with Aunty? Just drive, yeah? Still wanna see Kabir Singh? I got tickets. Only for you. Thank you. -Hello. -Hello, Ma'am. -I think your mother wants to hit me. -No way. -Look at that hottie. -She loves you. Let's sit over there. This chair is broken. Okay. -I swear, I'm never... -He's so dramatic. -talking to another girl. -What happened? -I'm done. -Poor boy. Back in college-- It's okay, it happens. I got friend-zoned in school and college. I'm gonna stop talking to girls. Oh, what a loss! Why do you guys keep doing this? Doing what? Stop acting like a cheesy couple. What's cheesy? We're friends. Close friends! A little too close. You have a dirty mind, Prerna. Only you think this. Right, Timmy? I think it's weird. Friends don't act like this. How will you guys move on if you keep doing this? You're all crazy. You're lucky you don't have to choose between us. Oh, so this is for us? Such a sweet! I have three things to say. This is our personal matter. Ginny is screening marriage prospects. You can't speak of all of society. And we have moved on. Right, Ginny? Aunty is right to worry about you. Stop nagging. The day Ginny decides to marry, all the guys in the capital will line up. Like the suitors lined up for Panchali in Hastinapur. Panchali was the princess of Panchal. That's where she got married. And you're the princess of New Delhi. He's back in the kitchen. Half the week we eat two dinners a day. Mama, Let him cook. It's the only thing he's good at. Then why doesn't he cook all the meals. You don't need me. Rita, have a drink and calm down, here. He'll use up all the groceries. What're you worried about? Your son or the groceries? Sunny! Don't be discouraged. How can I not, Mommy? My heart is broken. Anyone else would have become a poet on Facebook. Hey, Romeo, enough with the drama. This is a part of life. -And a recurring part of your life. -Stop it. -My son doesn't drink. -Oh, really? Brother, you're as bad at flirting as you are at tennis. Papa, find him a girl for an arranged marriage. That's the first sensible thing she's said. Have a roti. Papa, since you're insisting, you do the hard work. Find a suitable match for me. You should talk to Shobha. She even married that high-school dropout Jonty. My son is a graduate. He scored 58%. All mothers think their sons are great. But I'll talk to Shobha. We'll see what she says. What do you think, Nimmi? You should meet her. You had a crush on her daughter. What? No, that's not true. You never told us. Papa, it's not true. It's just that we were classmates in school. -Not true, really? -No. That's ridiculous. Sometimes it's Monday, sometimes Tuesday, right? -You going home? -My kids have exams. I get really tense in this class. Ms. Shobha! -Mr. Sethi. -Yes. -Bye! How are you? -How are you? Good, by His grace. I have an important request. -What is it? -I'm looking for a girl to marry. Mr. Sethi, I still love Mr. Juneja. You are so mischievous. Very funny. I need a nice girl for my son, Sunny. -He's grown up? -Yes, by His grace. The children grow so fast, right? True. Drive, we'll talk on the way. -Yeah? -Yes. So, what kind of a girl does Sunny want? Beggars can't be choosers. -Beggar? -My son is a very simple boy. We just want a girl smart enough to take care of him and his business. I'll also make her a partner in my shop. So you want her to forgo her career for your son's sake? -Your thoughts are so outdated. -No, we are very modern. In fact, I have an automatic car and a phone with 4G. Really. Come on. Then I'd suggest you ask Sunny to meet me. -Monday. -Monday. -Alone. -Alone? Boys aren't honest in front of their parents. They just nod to what the parents say. Fine, I'll send him over. We are very modern. And you drive an automatic car. -See you. -Bye. -Bye. -See you. Bye-bye. -Hello, Aunty. -You finally decided to show up. Come on! I spent two hours getting this food for you. -Show it to me. -Have a look. I'm not joking. Thank you. You don't need to thank me, Aunty. I'm family. You know I'm always here for you. I know. Why don't you come by tomorrow? I'm making karela curry. Oh, your delicious karela! That would be awesome. You know I count my fingers every time I eat your karela curry? To make sure I don't eat one while licking them. Enough with the flattery! I swear. By the way, where's Ginny? She's with her friends. Great. It's been a while since we talked. I'll go see what she's up to. Okay, can I eat this? -Enjoy. I'll go find Ginny. -Alright. JASWINDER WEDS HARMANPREET -They have spent a lot. -It's their mob money. You're better off single, bro. Why? After every wedding, there's a bet placed on whether you will be the next one to marry. I always bet a 1,000 that you won't. You know, I've won 15,000 so far. Your loss is my gain, bro. You shouldn't be joking about this. Don't lose hope. You'll get married. Jonty is getting married because his father opened a showroom for him. If opening a restaurant would get one married, then all single men would have already done so. I have spoken to Shobha. We'll get you married. Yes, Mr. Ahuja? No, I haven't wet my whistle yet. Where? In the car? I'll be right there. -Papa, come on! -Go. Come along. Have some. Go ahead, Papa. -Go ahead. -Right. Son, a fire that feels good -can still burn. -Enjoy your drink. Suit yourself. You look gorgeous, Aunty. Good day, my Lady. Hey. That's quite the greeting. Aunty! Oh, you recognized me? -Sunny Sethi. -Yes. -Real name, Satnam Sethi. -Yes. Bachelor in Business from Deshbandhu College with 58% marks. You're an excellent cook, but having trouble getting married. -I'm-- -That's good. That's good. You're my last hope, Aunty. Please, marry this bachelor immediately. I'll talk to you the after tomorrow. -I am quite busy right now. -Okay. Coming! Where'd she go? -No boyfriend? -Yeah. -Coffee. -Hi. -Two cups, please. -Remember me? Two cups of coffee, please. Yes. Just one cup, please. You can have this one. I had them add chocolate. Are you one of the servers? You're all talk and no show You're the Eminem of the poor I am India's Madonna, I shine I tend to ignore your kind Forget my heart You won't even get my autograph You have become a laughing stock I won't waste my time on you So don't even think about talking to me I am not your alcohol Once my beats play Your drums will bust You're a laughing stock Sorry for the inconvenience Oh my beloved, don't make me a laughing stock For in my eyes, you are precious Why don't you spend some time with me? Why don't you spend some time with me? So many boys are single because of me I have hunted many hunters like you So many boys are single because of you You have hunted many hunters like me You can try all the tricks you've got You won't get me There are many like you -But there is just one me -What? You have become a laughing stock I won't waste my time on you For in my eyes, you are precious Once my beats play Your drums will bust You have become a laughing stock Oh my beloved don't make me a laughing stock So don't even think about talking to me I am not your alcohol Why don't you spend some time with me? -Nice car. -It's a Beamer. Did you pay the deposit, or is this daddy's as well? Hey, not everything's from Papa. Mama paid for it. It's a nice gift. Let's take it to lunch tomorrow. We'll have to cancel it. Papa wants me in Manesar. He says it's important. And I'm not important? Ginny, you're being possessive again. We're friends now. You need to give me some space. Prerna's right. We should stop this completely. I've told you to find someone else. I can help. If you're so worried about me, why don't you marry me? Back to marriage again? I'll say three things. What would we get from marriage? Okay, so we get married, have kids, then what? Think about their lives. We've yet to live ours. It's better this way. -What about my feelings? -You don't care about my feelings. I got a new Beamer. I'm elated. It's got a V8 engine, 12 airbags, and the roof opens with a click. Ginny, please don't do that. Hey, it's a Beamer! Marry Ginny? You must be joking, Aunty? You had a crush on her in school, right? The whole school had a crush on her. Many bought a ticket, but you're winning this lottery. Aunty, I don't see Ginny around. You will see her soon enough. I made paneer fritters especially for you. Hang on. Paneer fritters, please. Come. -Hello. -Put them there. -And the sauce? -Here. Aunty, you should call Ginny. -Ginny's at the office. -Then why am I here? What're you doing? It's a secret, that's why I moved closer to tell you. Okay, now tell me. Ginny wants a love marriage. So why would she marry me? So sweet. You're a darling. You have a clean past. You have a bright future. And more... more importantly, Ginny doesn't hate you. Yes, but she doesn't love me either. I'll make her love with you. Just do as I say. Aunty, do you know my relationship history? -I don't. -I don't have one. If I have to convince the girl, what will you do? I'll guide you. Don't worry. Just do as I say. Okay? Ginny's my daughter, my DNA. I know her. Don't worry. Here, have a fritter. Look, I'm telling you, I have a 100% matchmaking record. I've matched everyone in the city. None have separated or divorced so far. Say yes. Her mother is guiding you, isn't she? Then she will pull you through. What's the problem? Mothers know everything about their daughters. Oh, please, Mama, don't lie. You don't even know my shoe size. -I'm going to pull your tongue out. -Come on, now. I think you should drop it. It's not your cup of tea. I'll meet Shobha tomorrow. Papa, why meet her? Just call and talk to her. -Yeah? -Here. -No, wait. -Is it unlocked? -No, wait. -Hey! What are you doing? What's with him? Sunny, what're you doing in the kitchen? -Lunch is already made. -It's okay. You can make rice pudding. Just make sure to add slivered almonds. Mommy, you should make him meet a new girl every day. You won't ever have to cook again. -Good. -Listen up. Now, I'm making rice pudding and I'll make Ginny your sister-in-law and his daughter-in-law. I swear upon the one who made me. Hey, why is he swearing upon me? You didn't make him alone. You'll woo Ginny easily. -You're quite confident. -Take this. She has my DNA. She takes after me. Aunty, a child has the DNA... of the father as well. It's not fair. Women should get a majority of something. It is true... God is a man. Oh, come on. Why did you ask me to meet you here so early? Get used to getting up early. Ginny takes the 8:45 train to the office. The metro isn't the most romantic place. We'll take it one step at a time. First step, friendship. To avoid suspicion meet her on the train. -What'll I do on the train? -I'll let you know. First, get to the station on time. Come on! You're so slow. This fatso is a brisk walker. The train is here! -What? -The train is here! -What's your problem? -Your train! Just left. I take the next one. I'm not blind. Sorry. Aunty, dot. First impression failed. Dot, dot. When I told her she'd miss her train, she rebuked me. Exclamation mark. Sad smiley. Sent. It's okay, Son. You can make a good impression on the train. -See you then. -See you. FOR SENIOR CITIZENS &amp; PERSONS WITH DISABILITY -Are you from Hansraj college? -Yes, what's wrong? -Didn't they teach manners? -What's wrong, bro? A senior citizen is standing and you're sitting. Up! -No, it's okay. -Move it, man. -No, Son, please sit. -You sit, Uncle. -Please sit, Uncle. -I don't want to! Have you lost your mind? Try to understand. I have piles. My rear hurts when I sit down. Why are you forcing me to sit? I don't want to sit. Sit down, Son. -Hi. -Hello. If you snooze, you lose, my boy. Right, Ms. Shobha? You'll have to do more, Son. If not, you'll be here forever sipping tea with us. -Did you pack the samosas? -Yes. And give me six Kachoris as well. -Three pieces each of these. -Okay. I'll take this as well. -Cancel the Kachoris. -All of them? -Hello, Ms. Pooja. -Hi, ma'am. Give me two plates. Make it spicy. Is the water cold? Give me the sweet sauce and extra potatoes. Hello. -Hi. -Hi. My friend Prerna. Sunny. Hi, Satnam. I've seen you somewhere. -At Jonty's wedding! -Yes. You are a good dancer. What brings you here? I'm getting samosas. Mama loves Haldiram's samosas and bhujiya. Their Golgappas are also very good. They add ginger to the sweet chutney. I know. That's what we're getting. They'll get cold. -What? -The Samosas. Right. Bye. What's going on? That's him, right? TILAK NAGAR TANDOORI NIGHT CHEF SATNAM SETHI Take a good look. Don't drive her. Here, go. Here's the next one? Come. Stop! Barakhamba Road! Stop! Barakhamba Road! Come on, man! Stop! -Hi. -Hi. Trouble catching a ride? Yeah, I can't get one. Where do you want to go? -Barakhamba Road. -I'm going that way. Let me drop you. -No, thanks. I'll manage. -Are you sure? There might not be another one. I keep running into you. What's going on? What do you mean? Life's mysterious. You never know where, when, who you'll meet. -So you're a philosopher. -The streets of Delhi make you one. I see. Please, some food? She loves to do social work. If there's an opportunity, take it. These poor people break my heart. Wait. People like you encourage them. It's a scam! Haven't you seen Slumdog? -Yeah. -He can work, can't he? Yes, you're right. Then? -He can certainly sell fritters. -Of course. Buzz off! Don't be so rude. Sorry. -Get in. -Bye, Papa. -Go. -Thank you. Drive. I don't know who's jinxing me. I'll miss the target by just five polices. People just don't get that we can make them rich after they are dead. Can you help me? -I had no clue. -Ginny, someone's here for you. Show me Chawla's policy… -Hello. -Hello. Yes, sir, how can I help you? I would like to insure my wife. Of course, this way please. Where are you from? -Noida. -Not far from here. Ma'am, we're here to get insured. Prerna? Could you please take them to the conference room? -Yeah, sure. -Please go with her. Yes, ma'am. They're my employees. Now, you'll meet your target. Papa might kill me if he sees no one's at the shop. Ginny? Coming. Carry on. She's loves Badhshah and Mika. She'll wanna go with you. We've spent 5,000 on these tickets. Make sure you don't waste them. These tickets will bring you closer. What do you say? SAVE EARTH SAVE LIFE Hurry up. Go! All the best. Hello. -Hi. -Hi. Are you stalking me? You're asking me? So, what do you do on the weekend, generally? Generally, I chill with my friends. Hey, I love to chill! I like listening to music. I am a huge fan of Badhshah. -Really? -Yes. He has a show with Mika on Saturday. The Magic Moments show. I'm going. -Okay. -Who's calling me now? Yeah? Go on. Yes, I have VIP tickets. What? Hang on. You're going to the temple instead! That's not right. Okay. Fine, I'll see what I can do. My friend, Montu. We were going together, but he bailed. What will I do with these tickets? -Sell them. -No, I want to go. I won't sell them. -Then take someone else. -Good idea. Will you come with me? -Are you hitting on me? -No. No, I was just generally asking. To chill. I already have plans with someone else. Okay, bye. What did you eat before his birth? Pumpkin. MAGIC MOMENTS Coming through. -Excuse me. -Hey! What is she doing? It's so crowded. Concerts tend to be. Why are you here? Come on, I couldn't waste that ticket. I'm at a concert with a prospect's mother. You can come with Ginny after marriage. Boiling milk Will give you the results as desired Your dancing in the rain sets the stage on fire Sets the stage on fire Sets the stage on fire I'm impulsive, I'm explosive My beauty is off the charts I am known for stealing hearts I always have secret admirers stealthily clicking my pictures If I turn around and look at them Doomed are those risk takers Social media is talking about me Both young and old are crazy about me There is fire in the rain, oh my heart There is fire in the rain, oh my heart Listen up, you crazy and enchanting girl I didn't sleep a wink I didn't sleep a wink, oh my heart There is fire in the rain, oh my heart Your beauty made my jaw drop When you danced in Delhi You made Agra rock When you came to meet me Society started to conspire When you went out in a red dress The news spread like wildfire You have vowed to spare none You are controlling All the boys just for fun You have the world following you on TikTok You have left no stone unturned You have caused havoc You have come wearing flowers in your hair You have so many boys Competing for you everywhere I have come wearing flowers in my hair I have so many boys Competing for me everywhere Where do you finally end up? Your body is like a heater, I hear Someone will get burnt, I fear I hope I don't end up doing... I hope I don't end up doing something naughty, oh my heart There is fire in the rain, oh my heart Listen up, you crazy and stupid boy Listen up, you crazy and stupid boy I won't let you sleep a wink I won't let you sleep a wink I won't let you sleep a wink, oh my heart There's fire in the rain, oh my heart There's fire in the rain, oh my heart There's fire in the rain, oh my heart You knew it! But had me go after her. They broke up over a year ago, but were clearly hugging. You've made a fool out of me. You got me into this mess! My mind wants me to stop right now. But my heart says to go on. You'll be alone forever if your mind rules over your heart. Keep working on your friendship with Ginny. She'll melt once she sees your goodness. Don't you think this is manipulation? This way Ginny won't love me for real. What is love? It's just habit. She just needs to get familiar with you, and you with her. Love will happen automatically. Come on, drive. There's fire in the rain, oh my heart... Ginny, I gotta say something. Go on. We'll have to cancel our plans for Mussoorie. Why? I have just three things to say. My parents are making me meet a foreign girl. I agreed for their sake. I'm only meeting her for them. She's a family friend's daughter. Sorry. That was four things. -Is it yours? -Yes. By the way, you dance well. I saw you yesterday. You and your friend. I told you, I had plans with someone. He's an old friend of mine, Nishant. You don't need to explain. It's your life, your decision. Hey! Wanna get coffee? -Are you hitting on me? -No, I am just generally asking. Not coffee then, dinner. -I get to choose the place. -Will do. -Will do? -That would be great. In fact, that would be awesome. Have some onions. -Thank you. -Thank you. What kind of a name is Princess Simran? Papa loved me, so that's the name he registered. What's the connection between Princess and Ginny? It's only love not logic, when Punjabi parents name their kids. CONFUSION Amazing. Nishant just hates this place. He doesn't like anything remotely Indian. Really? Then what made him like you? So you've dropped the formality. Hopefully, we will soon drop... all inhibitions. By the way, is Nishant your boyfriend? Ex. We have the same friends, so we see a lot of each other. That sounds confusing. That's the big problem with our relationship. He is confused. I am confused. What's your current status? We... are just good friends. So, you are single? -But not available. -No problem. -I'm not hitting on you. -Don't even try. My state of mind is all messed up, even if I were interested I'd probably say no. Really? So you're somewhat interested. Eat your dinner. -More roti? -I'm good, thank you. I don't want an affair. I want marriage if you're interested. What will you gain from marriage? Tilak Nagar Tandoori Nights. My restaurant. A loveless marriage is okay? I am over the romantic phase. I wanna get real. -You are crazy. -Why? Life is... no fun without romance. Those... little coincidences... like us meeting at the Metro Station? Like rajma and rice at your favorite restaurant? Isn't this also a coincidence. PRERNA'S BIRTHDAY SURPRISE -I need to go. -Where? It's my friend Prerna's birthday. Let me tag along. We're friends now, your friends are our friends. Don't push your luck. Look at the effort he's putting in for you. They all do at first, then later turn into confusion. You offer to get married and they keep you hanging. I like Sunny. Ask him to come on our Mussoorie trip. Don't even think about asking him. This one's too eager to get married. He's cute. Mom's been making tinda every day. -Can I have some of your rajma? -Sure, help yourself. Tried a new entrée for my menu. Let me know how it is. Aunty, your tinda is delicious. Simply great. Ginny doesn't know how lucky she is. Honestly. Is the movie so bad you're watching me? You're so cute I can't watch the movie. Cheesy. I'm in for 50. Since Nishant's not going we'll have to get a hotel in Mussoorie. My uncle Mr. Chadha has a hotel in Mussoorie. We'll book it, don't worry. You two planned a trip to Mussoorie? We're all going. Except Nishant, of course. We planned this a while back. Wanna come? I'd agree to die if you asked that nicely. Still with the cheesy lines. If you want, I'll stop right now. My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us The eyes express what the heart desires Yet it remains unvoiced My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us I will keep finding you With my heart on my sleeve No matter how many times you dishearten me I will never give up on us My prayers have been Finally answered We might have come together a little late But we at least met My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us CONFUSION Ginny! -Tired? -Not at all. You're panting. Oh, it's nothing. Thanks. May I ask something? Go ahead. You shouldn't refuse kada prasad. I know. Why didn't you take it at the gurudwa? Drop it. We're close friends. You can tell me. There you go. Keep talking yourself up. Ginny, I know you're very strong. But some burdens should be shared. What if I don't want to? That's cool, your call. Fine, listen. Every year... Papa planned something new for my birthday. He'd take me to an orphanage sometimes. Early in the morning, we'd feed the kids. Your father made you do social work on your birthday? Sorry, go on. He used to take me to Appu Ghar. I heard it's closed now. And this relates to kada prasad how? No matter where we went in the morning, later we'd always go to the gurudwara. And Papa used to make... kada prasad for all the devotees. Wow! It tasted heavenly. On my tenth birthday... Papa went out to get flour for the kada prasad. He never came back. I never went to a gurudwara again. I've never taken kada prasad ever since. I am so sorry, Ginny. I shouldn't have brought it up. I don't know why I asked. Have you always been like this? My convoy and my destination is you You are my companion too I know what love is Only because of you I know the destination Is still a little far away But we have at least started Proceeding there together My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us The eyes express what the heart desires Yet it remains unvoiced My love's close to me Yet there's some distance between us Thank God Mama doesn't know about Sumeet. Who's Sumeet? He's my next door neighbor. Mama always invites him over for meals. She thinks he's like a brother to me. But actually, he was the first person I ever kissed. So you were dating him? No! It was just an experiment. Ten years ago. I'm sure you've kissed someone. Oh sure, lots of girls. I hope none were as clingy as Sumeet. Don't worry, Ginny. I am not like that. Even after marriage, I'll give you complete freedom to do what you want. You will give me freedom? Really? I mean... There he goes again. Talk about something else for a change. At first, I wanted to get married, so I could open my restaurant. Now, I'll have no regrets... restaurant or not. Why? You came. I really like you, Ginny. Marry me. I am asking you. You should meet my mother. I am ready. Just let me know when. You're both obsessed with marriage. That's all she ever talks about. I have it all planned out. A Bandhgala suit from Manyavar and a destination wedding at Noor Mahal. And now? Now, I don't care as long as it's with you. How do you want to get married? Something unique. Everyone does destination weddings. I want something different. Oh, my Maggi Sauce, I want to devour you. Don't cross the line. Or you'll get slapped. There... you slapped me. I'm crossing the line. Prerna has lost her mind. She wouldn't tell me where you were. But who can stop a local? Excuse me, bro. Ginny! What are you doing here, Nishant? Ginny, your absence got me thinking. I have just three things to say. I love you. No one understands us like we do each other. We are perfect for each other. When I realized this, I got in my car and drove to you. Here, look at this. Now. GINNY JUNEJA, WILL YOU MARRY ME? PRINCESS I won't play the fool anymore. Tell me what happened! Your daughter is crazy about Nishant. Forgive me, I am sorry. It's not certain. They won't marry. She will come back to you. I know my daughter. Like hell you know her! You know she smokes weed? You know Sumeet, who you invite over all the time? -He was her first boyfriend! -Nonsense! She doesn't smoke weed. Sumeet is like a brother to her. Ginny said her first kiss was with Sumeet. And she made me smoke weed! It's simple, Aunty. Your daughter and I are not compatible. If she is milk, I am lemon. Why don't you get it? My life has curdled to paneer. That's all we Punjabis have: feelings and paneer. -Sit down and listen. -Listening to you got me here. You kept goading, and l kept dreaming. But not any more! No more goading. End this adventure. You've done all you can. I've had enough. Thank you, I'm through. Listen to me. Sunny! -Sunny! -Oh, I see. -Is Ginny home? -What do you want with her? You sound angry. Is there a problem? -I can fix any problem. -What's your business with Ginny? No business. I'm just wondering how she is. She's not answering my calls. What did you do to make her do that? -I didn't do anything. -You were dating her? -No. -You kissed her! -No, Aunty. -Have you nothing to say? -No, Aunty, you should rest. -No more karela for you! -I'm good with rajma. -I'll fix you! There's no rush, Ginny. Take your time. I'll get my parents to meet Aunty only when you ask me to. So, where do you wanna eat? That dhaba is good. The Radisson is close. Let's eat there. Why bother asking me if you've already decided? Don't get upset. You know I don't like dhaba food. That food is unhygienic. Let's eat somewhere decent. We'll go to the dhaba whenever we wanna get sick. Will you go there if I want to? If you want to, of course we can. Let's go then. Lost again. Ginny isn't the only girl in the world. The Swift Drycleaners sent us their daughter Neha's proposal. I was saying no because of Ginny. What? They're mobsters! He'll marry the girl not the family. Got it? She's a smart girl, Papa. I've seen her at the parlor. She's from a good family. Each month, her mother feeds the temple devotees. And the jail feeds her uncle each month. -Jail? -He's a union leader. Doing good sometimes comes with a price. -Even Bhagat Singh went to jail. -Right. PRINCESS CALLING Didi took the day off. I made potato paratha for you. Can you get some yogurt? You okay? He always has this sour face. It was better when you argued with me. -At least talk to her. -What's the use, Aunty? She's made up her mind. I can't change that. You could if you talked to her. Don't give up so soon. -Siddharth! -Yes. Get the cement! How many times do I need to tell you? I can't force her to marry me. Mr. Sethi, talk to him. Ms. Shobha, he should've listened to me. Papa, don't baby me in front of people. Son, bitter pills and elder's advice take time to manifest. Correct. Sunny, we're saying this for your own good. You two have done enough. Stop it. I chased her for a long time. If it had worked, she'd be here, not with Nishant. "For my own good!" Hey! Come upstairs. Did you see that? Tell me what to do. -Sit down. -No, thanks. -Please, I beg your pardon. -I don't want to. The number you have dialed is currently busy. You're not talking to me? -Siddharth! -Yes. Get a banana milkshake for the lady. She likes driving people bananas. Cut the crap. We need to talk. He proposed out of the blue. -I was surprised too. -This is what you wanted. Yes, but he didn't do it when I wanted. So, what do you want now? Tell me. I want to be with you. -To spend time with you-- -Not with Confusion still in the picture. Honestly. What do you want? Ginny, you need to decide. Your mind's half here... and half with Confusion. That won't do. You have my address, my phone number, my email, everything. Let me know when you get rid of your confusion. Tea? Thanks. What's on your mind? I'm confused. You always are. Tell me, is it Confusion? What do I tell Nishant? Do you want to marry him? I don't know. Do you love him? I don't know. Then know this. Hopefully, you'll only marry once. Over the years, you and Nishant have broken up and patched things up. When you're married, it's harder to patch things up after a break up. I'm ready to introduce my parents to your mother. But I don't want to marry you. You kept telling me, "Move on, move on." So I moved on. Of the 36,405 things I must have said, that's what you dwell on? And move on to what? Sunny? I don't constantly require a man in my life, Nishant. Sunny's trouble. He's trouble. From the time he entered your life-- Nishant! You proposed to me. You came so far for me. You planned everything. I loved it. But now... I don't feel the same about you anymore. Don't mistake infatuation for love. You're gonna define love for me, Nishant? What're you doing? I'll drop you off. No, it's okay. Ginny, listen to me. You're unsure about marrying me. Okay. But we've always been friends. So let's be friends. Please. Let's go. Ginny, I wanna say three things. You should reconsider. I can wait. You won't find our chemistry anywhere. You know... nowhere. -Mama? -Yes? I want to introduce you to someone. Who? Nishant? Nope. Then who? A boy. A friend, he's nice. -What's his name? -Satnam Sethi. Satnam Sethi, okay. Where'd you meet him, the office? No, Mama. You know the Sethis from nearby? -The Sethis? -Yes. -Oh, the ones with the hardware store. -Yes. His son. -Sunny. -Sunny? Tell me about it! This love story that's been brewing under my nose. How long have you been seeing him? He's coming to dinner tomorrow. You can ask him then. That I will. I'm introducing you to my mother so that you know I am serious. You take a few steps. I'll take a few more. One day, we'll reach the altar. It's just dinner. We aren't engaged, so chill. Just introduce me to your mother. She'll fix everything from engagement to honeymoon. -Ginny? -Yes? Turn on the air conditioner. Okay, Mama. -You're looking good. -Think so? He's not coming here to see you. -I hate that doorbell. -You're looking hot. Hello, Aunty. You? What are you doing here? Aunty, Ginny? My parents are in town, so I thought I'd introduce them. -Hello. -Mama, this is Ginny. Hello, please come in. -Hello. -I can take that. Ginny? Listen, Sunny, Mom's not feeling well. She'd prefer you came tomorrow. What's wrong with her? Why would she cancel dinner? She's unwell. Sorry... Tomorrow? Okay, Princess. Take care. Okay, bye. Hello? Hello, Aunty. Yes, hello. Ginny asked me to come tomorrow. Nishant and his parents showed up. -What? -It's better if you come tomorrow. Is your daughter crazy? She invites me then cancels and invites him instead? Is this marriage or musical chairs? Don't get upset, Son. You're coming tomorrow, right? If Ginny said tomorrow, come tomorrow. -Okay? -This isn't right. Son, I have to go, bye. Hello? We run a transport business in Rohtak. I see. Son, you're not planning to join your family in Rohtak? No, Aunty. I want to stand on my own feet. Initially, my family helped out but I've expanded my insurance business. We've hardly helped him. We just got him a house in Saket. And he took our old Mercedes. He's paying for a new BMW with his own money. I see. We just paid two million for the down payment. We offered another million, but he refused. He's a self-respecting man. Our Nishu is very independent. Stop it, Mama. -Some rice, Nishant? -No, I'm on a Keto diet. I see. I'll get it. Excuse me. This is delicious, Aunty. Have some more. -Sunny? -Good evening, Princess Simran. How are you? I dropped by for some advice. Sorry for disturbing your dinner. -Sunny, let's talk outside. -No, let's talk here. We can get a public opinion. It's a serious matter. Let him talk. Even I can help. We haven't been formally introduced. I am Nishant Rathee. And I am Satnam Sethi. The sooner you know me, the better it will be for you. Go home, Sunny. We'll talk tomorrow. I have a friend, Veeru. He loves a confused girl named Basanti. So what's the problem? That he's in love or that her name is Basanti? Veeru truly loves Basanti. But Basanti's ex-boyfriend, Gabbar, is manipulating her and continues to re-enter her life. Gabbar the ex-boyfriend? Has he asked Basanti to dance on broken glass? Aunty, Veeru's love for her is not enough. What also matters is what Basanti wants. If Veeru really loves this girl, he should give her time, to process her confusion. He wouldn't impose himself. -I'm not imposing, Ginny. -Then what is this? You came uninvited. That's rude. Don't blame him. You invited him this morning. Nishant and his family came uninvited, not me. -Sunny, you're upset. -What's this, Nishant? Mr. Rathee-- Go wait in the car, Papa. -I'll be out soon. -Let's go. I don't know this version of Sholay. We didn't come here to be humiliated. -Hey, Confusion! -Alright, kitchen boy! Another word and you're going home in a doggie bag. You threatening me? Stay back. I am a Rathee. We're warrior caste. I'd have wrecked you by now if we weren't in Aunty's home. Such manners from an uninvited guest. Hear that? Aunty, Ginny invited me. I am talking to him. You begged me for years to bring my parents over. You… Sumeet? I didn't tell your mother about us because you asked me not to! You've been ignoring me for too long! What's going on? -Are you insane? -What have I done? That happened ten years ago. And I've lived with it for ten years. Trust me, Ginny. There'll be a bloodbath... if you marry anyone else. Did you say bloodbath, Mr. Peanut? What are you doing? -Stay back. -Let him go. -Let him go. -I won't. Don't do this! Nishant, bro, please don't do this! You're gonna hurt him! -Who's that Chhota Bheem? -What's wrong with you? Your Sunny's is driving me insane. -I can do more. -You're out of control. You're out of control. You invited us both! I didn't invite him. Shobha Aunty did! Mama? How do you know Sunny? His Papa and I have a yoga class. Stop it, Aunty. Drop the yoga. I'm already in the cobra pose. The truth is, six months ago, she made me go after you. Wait... the villian of our love story is your mother! Listen up, genius. A love story must have love. That's not what you two had. Don't worry, Ginny. Now that you know, we'll sort it out. Sort what out? The drama you created! You are the drama in my life! I asked to get married, but you wouldn't budge. But as soon as I got closer to another boy, you show up with your parents! -Ginny, three things-- -No, I have three things, so listen. It's time to pack your intentions in your BMW and go to Rohtak. I will no longer live my life based on your decisions. Now buzz off. Don't mock the way I talk, it hurts my regional feelings. Nishant, just leave. This isn't right. You're leaving me... for this liar? Think again. I'm done thinking. Now get going. Ginny. It's for the best. Now that Confusion's gone, we can start over. -Right? -Yes, everything will be alright. You have been following mother's instructios all along? No, Ginny, it's not so. I swear, I was going to tell you. I don't know what made me listen to your her-- "Listen to your her"? You wouldn't be here if not for me. I worked hard, Aunty. You can't hog all the credit. Why can't I? It was my idea. Anyone can have an idea. I did the hard work. Don't talk to me-- Stop, this! Leave. -Ginny? -Get up. -Please-- -Don't touch me. -Leave. -Ginny. Hear us out, Ginny. I'll talk to you later. Our relationship is over. Get out of here, you fraud. -Ginny-- -Out. Get out of here. -Your mom-- -I don't want to hear it. -My love is sincere-- -Go! -Let me just say once, I love you. -Go! Ginny! -Just leave! -Alright. This is the last time then. For the last time, do you want to marry me or not? Tell me, do you want to marry me... Or not? No. Don't come crawling back! How dare you kitchen boy? I'm serious. I don't care. -Crazy woman. -You're crazy. Show your face again and I'll end you! Scram! The one who was once accordant Is upset The one who was once a companion Has now a different path to tread Why is the story of my life Being penned By tears? Why does what once felt so good Feel so bad now? I have already lost everything I have nothing to wait for Once again The heart treads on the same path Once again The heart treads on the same path Neha Gulati's mom sent Sunny another proposal. I think we should drop it. Have you seen the state he's in? I don't feel like it... Aiming for a win, it lost My dreams made me lose my heart My shattered dreams remain undisclosed My companion's location remained unknown I ventured out to do the right thing But it went all wrong I don't know what I have done wrong unknowingly Once again The heart treads on the same path Once again The heart treads on the same path Son... take the shop. Open your restaurant. Just don't be so sad. No, Papa, the shop is fine how it is. I don't feel like cooking anyway. Papa? Tell Mama to fix a meeting with Neha Gulati. Won't it be hard for you to adjust to that family? I'll marry the girl... not her family. Talk to her. In this battle of fates Relationships were defeated Someone ask the poor heart What would make you happy? What do you desire? The house that was so lively Stands empty now The once treasured dream Lies shattered now SATNAM - NEHA I sent out WhatsApp invites. But I wanted to invite you personally. Of course, a personal invite to watch a person writhe in pain. This place isn't on WhatsApp. You chose the perfect date. A day after Ginny's birthday. You could have made her choose another date. I wouldn't dare, Aunty. By the way, where's Ginny? Did she go to work early? Okay, all the best. You can go, now. I figure you wouldn't dare show up? The invite is a courtesy. We'd go if it was in the city. We can't travel to Noor Mahal. You aren't that special. Don't be rude to the poor kid. It's just an invitation. Why don't you adopt him and leave me alone? What is your daughter saying, Aunty? I know we won't marry, but I wouldn't make you my sister. Are you done? -Now leave. -You leave. Aren't you late? It's my house, go. Adopt him. Enjoy the dessert. Ginny, please hear me out. Nishant, there's nothing to talk about. Please stop creating more confusion in my life. Ginny, I... I apologize. I'll just say three things. I'm sorry... for hurting you again and again... for asking you to move on but not letting you move on... and for proposing marriage... out of insecurity. This might be the last time we talk, so let me say one more thing. If you feel that Sunny is perfect for you... then don't worry about it not working out because we didn't. Every relationship has its own destiny. You'll learn what it is if you give it a chance. Am I right? Hey, let me take you home. Let's take things slow for now. Maybe some other time? Fine, I won't force you. Take your time. But... friends. -Promise. -No more confusion? No more confusion. Mr. Sethi, we're their elders. We're smarter. Yet we did such a stupid thing. Both of them are stubborn. They'll cry in their rooms, but never acknowledge their pain. The question now is: Who will blink first? You want to apologize? Yes, dear. I'm sorry for meddling in your personal life. I learned one thing. after Sunny entered our lives. I don't know you as well as I thought I did. It's okay. At least you know that now. Please don't cry, Mama. Do one thing. Burn the invite. We won't attend that idiot's wedding. I cannot bear to see my daughter sad, to see her insulted. That dog thinks I can't see him marry another, right? Dear... Dogs also think their bark can stop a car. Don't stop your car. Burn the invite and close the chapter. No, Mama. I'll attend and celebrate his wedding. Start packing. You won't be able to handle it. Mama, he won't be able to handle it. Start packing and hold onto this.

What? Can't you convince Sunny? Can you convince Ginny? You can't, right? I wanna show you something. I won't go with you. Come with me, Ginny. Please. I've something to show you. I don't want to. Listen to me one last time? I won't ask for anything else. I already said. Not with you. Why not go with him? He's asking nicely. He won't hurt you. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Princess Happy birthday to you Thanks. For all this. Thanks. For thanking me. No matter where we went in the morning, later we'd always go to the gurudwara. And my Papa used to make kada prasad for all the devotees. It tasted heavenly.

It's already too late. I want you to be sure this time. Okay. Come now. Now, apologize to me. I was right and you were wrong. How cruel. I'm so worried, and you just want to be right. We wouldn't be here if you'd listened to me. Want some? I don't drink on Tuesdays, Mama. Fine. Does it look good? This is all your fault! The heroine had a change of heart. It's gonna get crazy. What did I do? You shouldn't have colluded with mother and lied to me. -Excuse us. -Seriously. What do you want? That's what I'm asking you. Come on, man. I always knew you were out of my league. But then your mother asked me to marry you. Like someone serving me my dreams on a silver platter. But I was right, Ginny. I could never reach you. Then why take me out yesterday? Why spend the whole day with me before your wedding? I don't know... Hope from a lingering dream? What's stopping you now? Fulfil your dream! You have the stage, the guests, the suit, the Noor Mahal. What more do you need? Let's get married. Have you lost your mind? I am not the Sheikh of Dubai! There's no way I handle two wives in my life. And what about her? Call it off. No, you're unpredictable, Ginny. What'll happen when you change your mind? You're also stubborn. If my mind changes, you can change it back. Don't think so much. We'll apologize to everyone. I'll talk to Neha's father. They'll understand if we explain the right way. Let's go. Society will humiliate us, Son. We cannot ruin our lives out of the fear of humiliation. And Neha? -What about her? -Uncle. Neha will be upset. But I am sure she'd do the same if she knew the truth. Yes, Uncle. Uncle, please try and understand. You are such kind people. -If you-- -Just because we're kind -doesn't mean we'll ruin our reputation. -Gullu! Uncle, what's the use of a loveless marriage? We too had an arranged marriage. And we get along. -They too will get along. -Uncle. We could have eloped without your permission. You take us for idiots! "We could have eloped." Like we would let you! -Try to understand. -Your mother's a renowned matchmaker. Find someone else to torment. Watch your language, Uncle. Show some manners. -I'll teach you manners. -How can-- It's been decided. You must marry Neha. Gullu, escort him to the venue. Uncle, please. -Let's go. -Where? To the wedding venue. You know, the guns we carry aren't toys. And you both have small families. -Wait. -Just six bullets would do the job. Move it. -You can't force him. -You can't do this. Uncle, open the door. Wait, Mr. Gulati. No! Come on! -Sunny. -Papa, it's okay. Calm down, Mr. Sethi. Proceed, Pandit. Sir, please get the bride. Put the safa over his neck. Tie the knot with the bride's pallu. Wash your hands. Please wash them. Now, the groom will take the fourth vow. Ginny! Ginny, you cannot marry him! I warned you there'd be a blood bath! My boy. You're at the wrong place. That's not Ginny. That's Ginny. Ginny is not here. Go look somewhere else. -Uncle, that's Ginny -That's Neha. Lift her veil and check! They're all fooling you. Please, hurry or she'll marry him! It would be inauspicious, Uncle. He's just bluffing, Uncle. -Stop your nonsense! -Shut up. Uncle... Ginny! What are you doing here? Gullu, where is Neha? Papa? Neha, have you lost your mind? You're so desperate that you forced someone to marry me? Neha... You've dishonored your family. Is honor more important than my happiness? We are doing all this for your happiness. How could I be happy with him? He'd remember this forced wedding every time he looked at me. I can do better. He's no Shah Rukh Khan. I'll easily find another. But what will society say? Mr. Gulati, what society? You can never please everyone. Thank God Ginny came to me, otherwise you would've married me off to a mule. Pandit, continue the mantras. -Marry them. -Hey, no! Pandit, don't say anything. Move Neha! There will be a bloodbath. Are you threatening her! Are your threatening our daughter! I'll teach you some respect! -Neha, move aside! -Please, let him go! -I'll kill him! -Please, don't do this! Don't do this, Uncle, please! You little twerp! Run! Neha... You shouldn't have betrayed us. Uncle. It is not Neha's fault. She sacrificed her happiness to help two people she barely even knows. And, Uncle... for all of this... no one's to blame. But us. We are very sorry, Uncle. We couldn't see... past our egos. We didn't realize that our break up was breaking up our families too. And my stubbornness... dragged you all into this confusion. Uncle, we are idiots. We are very-very sorry. Neha... We are very sorry, Neha. -Save your sorries for the temple! -Gullu! -No marriage-- -Enough! What's the point of fighting for her if she doesn't wish to marry him? -Papa. -Let them get married if they want to. -Papa. -Let go of me. Get married now or you'll forever remain almost married. Can you be happy with a fraud? Can you keep this crazy woman happy? Thank you. Thank you, Neha. Can I say something? -I'm not a mule. -No, she was right. Don't worry, my dear. Your parents will eventually come around. I'll help with your father. And your wedding, promise. If she can get this mule married, then you'll have no problem.
