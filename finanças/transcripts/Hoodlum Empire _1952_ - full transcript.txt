HOODLUM EMPIRE Good evening, Commissioner. Oh, Commissioner. - Senators. Gentlemen. This is Inspector Willard of our department. Senator Stephens. - Inspector. Senator Blake. - How are you? Senator Tower. - How do you do. The police department have been helpful to us, Inspector. - Senator? This is Ralph Foster, chief counsellor of this committee. How do you do, genteman? - How do you do. Here's the witness list, Senator. There are 23 main witnesses on this list. We've been able to serve subpoenas on 19 of them. One of those served is Joe Gray. There's nothing much on Gray, except in the back files. We've got a lot on him, inspector. But I'm sorry to say that we have not been able to serve Nicholas Mancani. He's still out of the country. And he won't come back for a long time. You pay, Frankie. Add 50 for gettin' up in the middle of the night. Ok, Miss Williams. They're in your office, sir. Take that valise upstairs. Hello, boys. We've been doing a little night work. - Oh, yeah? That's good. How you feeling, Charley? - He don't feel. I'm worried about you being here. - It's not safe. Why not? What's the matter? Every cop in the country's looking for you. Nobody sees me. If you use a bat on them, they still don't see me. You don't see me now, either. - Honey, I see you. Here. Suppose I'm asked by the senators to tell your whereabouts? Tell them I'm still fishing. You've got to use a little imagination too. Imagination in court is called perjury! Well, look... what are we all going to do, huh? Join a Sunday school just cos some people ask questions? I think what... - Counsellor, don't think. You do what you get paid to do - protect the interests of your client, Ok? I was merely trying to do that. Go upstairs and get us some breakfast. I'm starving! Oh, Floyd... - Morning, Miss Williams. Get the boss's breakfast. Then go back to bed. You look awful. Yes, Miss Williams. Ah, you did a nice job on these books. You boys should get yourselves a couple of hours of sleep. You don't want to be sleepy when you're talking to the senators. Charley, you've been getting a lot of bad publicity. What's the matter? Why can't you forget what a tough guy you are? Now, when you get on the stand, I want you to be nice to the senators. Say you want to help them out. You want to tell them everything, but... you just don't remember. You're sorry, your brains don't work. They'll believe that, if they believe anything. Be smart, Charley - act dumb. When the senators put the finger on me, you lambed out. Why did you come back now with all the head on, Nicky? You worried about Joe? Why? Why should I be worried about Joe? He wouldn't blow the whistle. I'm not as sure of that as you are. Or maybe you're worried too? Ok. I'm going to tell you why I'm here and I want you to remember it. I came back to make sure that Joe won't be killed. Unless, of course, it's... absolutely necessary. 'Joe Gray has just come in. Joe is Nicky Mancani's nephew.' It is believed that he is still 2nd in command of Mancani's organisation. 'This committee will now come to order.' Is Mr Nicholas Mancani present? Nicholas Mancani. Senator Stephens? - Yes, what is it? I am Benjamin Lawton, attorney for Mr Mancani. I want to tell the committee that we have had no success in process for committee. My office has not been able to contact Mr Mancani. Your office advised us last week, Mr Lawton, that Mr Mancani was in Cuba. He was in Cuba. We were told that he was on a fishing trip. There is no radio on the boat he chartered. Fishing? I sensed there might be something fishy about his trip to Cuba. Enter Mr Lawton's statement on the record, please. I'm sure that if my client knew of your desire to have him appear, he'd be anxious to comply with the committee's request. Will you call the next name, please? Charles Pignatelli. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. Sit down, Mr Pignatelli. For the record, let it be said that the witness appeared with Attorney Ben Lawton. Your name is Charley Pignatalli? - Charles K Pignatelli. Do you know Nicholas Mancani? - Of course. How long have you known him? - All my life. Do you know Joe Gray? - Sure, I know Joe Gray. How long have you known him? - Since he was a kid. Are you in business with Nicholas Mancani? I'm not in business with anyone. I'm retired. You have a large income, I believe. I get along. From what source do your earnings come? Investments. What kind of investments? Different kinds. Are any of these investments legitimate? I have advised my client not to answer because the inference is that there may be activities of my client that are not legitimate. Weren't you and Mancani in the booze business during prohibition? We sold a little whisky, yes. - A little? You sold it by the boat load. - I can't remember exactly how much.. The truth is, that you and Mancani are still in iligaly businesses, don't you? Businesses that are dirty and rotten. And you use the same violent methods, correct? I told you, Senator. I'm a retired man. Are Nicholas Mancani or Joe Gray investors with you? Maybe. Maybe not. I don't know. Tell us what you know about Joe Gray's activities. I heard he had some partners - local fellas in Central City, some kids he met when he was in the army. 'That's right. We did get to know each other in the army. But they weren't kids. They were men... 'real men.' Flat out. Keep it down. Medic! Medic! Dawson got it. Keep those ropes down. Keep flat, Ted. Don't give them another crack at you. It's Mike. Get down! Sucker. Dead man over there? Yeah. Take it easy, kid. We'll pick you up once it quietens down. They're warming up, I think. I thought the artillery would be up by now. We don't need those slobs. Keep your ears tucked in. Is the sergeant calling turn? Report and move on. Pleasure. Be still. It's all right. I'm a friend. Is that you, Padre? - Are you bad, Joe? She knocked off that Kraut that tried to finish the job. Compre English? Yes. You stay here. I'll get help. I just want to say... You mustn't. - I just want to say thanks. Your arm getting tired? Any better, Joe? That must be good blood. Maybe one of your friends back in the States gave it. - Not a chance! My friends don't give blood to anybody. How's the pain now? Ok, we'll fix that. That oughta do it. What are you doing here, Captain? We got in from the road when we saw you hit that farmhouse. Thought they had you guys stopped. Nobody stops me and my mob, captain. Never did, never will. That machine gun made it look pretty bad. - Machine gun? I knew about machine guns a long time before I saw this man's army. You took quite a gamble. Any kind of gamble you want, sucker. Horses, sucker luck, blackjack, dice. You name it, we do it. Just locking you in, kiddo. Ok, Copper. Don't forget we've got connections. I'll break you if you don't keep your nose out it. You putting the collar on me? Fine pal you are. Don't talk now. I owe Silk. You're lousy, Copper. Stop rousing me. Do you hear? Stop rousing me... He's asleep now. He was delirious. Maybe. Baretti and Dawson got hit. Bad? Dawson is. Dawson was from your hometown, wasn't he? Most of them are. Dawson's a member of my church back there. That's the tough part of the national guard outfit - you know your men, maybe even their wives and kinfolk. Sometimes, I hope I don't have to go back and tell them what happened to all these men we've lost. Sorry, Simon. That's the wrong thing to say, I know. Dawson and Baretti joined the Guard when they were boys. Wanted to spend their summer vacations at the encampment. To tell the truth, I joined when I started in politics - to get votes. Gray here didn't join. Guess he couldn't fix the draft board. Sorry, Captain, but I don't believe that. When a New York racketeer comes to you as a private first class with a bunch of National Guard replacements... you don't think that's the way he wanted it, do you? The lieutenant's a good solider. Well, maybe that's because he was used to this kind of fighting before he got in. The captain will have to admit that he's earned his rank. The captain?! Don't formalise it, Simon. I admit he earned every promotion he got, in spite of me. I suppose he'd say, he made his point the hard way. I'm sorry, Simon. All I meant to say was, politics and war... they make strange bedfellows. Padre, we're leaving, sir. Run him nice and easy, Tracey! Mouchoir, s'il vous plait, mon oncle? Oui. Merci. Hi, Marte. Hi. Bonjour, Monsieur Dufor. Hi. Pour vous... Merci. Merci. Ok, Uncle. You're a little early today. You usually get here about 4 o'clock. We left sooner. Vous prenez les fruits? Merci. Merci. Ok, keep. The lieutenant's waiting for you at the hut, Marte. Voulez vous? - Oh, thanks. All right. Let's not rob her. She's brought this stuff for the lieutenant. How's the outfit? Ready to move? Well, the replacements have started coming in. - And as green as we were. For a bunch of green men, you did all right. Every one of you. - Your Sunday visitors are here, sir. An old friend of yours, Padre. It's Marte. Marte! I'm so glad you could be here today. Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory forever. Amen. # God of our fathers # Whose almighty hand # Leads forth in beauty # All the starry band # Of shining worlds # In splendour through the skies # Our grateful songs # Before thy throne arise. Home, boys. Hey, Padre, now you can tell the folks back home what heroes we are. How Company F is winning the war. I can tell them that, all right. If you run into Amy, you can tell her... You know what to tell her. Say, you'll be back there in time to christen the baby. Amy'll like that. I like it too, Ted. But just a temporary baptising. Just long enough for us to get back and give the kid a real christening. With music and food... Mama mia will cook the food. And can she cook! That ravioli, that spaghetti... Don't wake me up, boys. I'm living. The baptising will be a good one, eh? Yeah, they're really dreaming it up. You're going to be there too, no? I don't think so. You'll be godfather. No. You've got to be George to be godfather. Only if your name George? No. George is a way gamblers have of saying someone's Ok. You know, all right guy. Good. George means good to gamblers. George for good. I'll remember that. Then YOU must be George? No. Not like they are. Not like you are. You see, they all came from the same state... province. Most of them have been friends since they were kids. Small town kids. Village kids. Peasants? No. That means farmers. They just came from the same small city. Provincials? Yeah, that's right. But, er, don't let them hear you calling them that. Oh, no. I won't. When I was first sent to this outfit I thought, "What a bunch of apple knockers to fight a war with." Oh, apple knockers means hicks, farmers, you know? Provincials. But they have something that big city people just don't seem to have. You've heard about men who would be willing to die for each other. They would. A lot in this outfit have. Look at the chaplain. You boys know you don't need me. God will look after you if you just remember him. He talks about God as if... well, as if God grew up with the gang. Maybe he did. Maybe they grew up with him. I've missed a lot of things. But I didn't know how much I'd missed until I met these boys. And you. Me too? You rich American have so much. I'm sure there's nothing I... You live in a big city. I am... apple knocker. Peasant. You just miss your home in New York City. In New York City, Americans are... are rich. They have everything. Americans that live in the little towns have a little business, little house, a small car... have more. They're not rich Americans. If one owns all that, then he must be a very rich American, no? Would you like to live like that? Oh, I think so! I don't know. Lieutenant? Joe, I have to get back to base hospital. I think they're going to ship me home in a few days. Well, good luck, Padre. Thanks, Joe. Maybe we'll meet in the States sometime. There's a good chance. Goodbye, Marte. Goodbye. I guess we'll never see each other again. Would you like to take 8-500, Padre? - I'll pray for it. So long. 'I hear that Joe Gray and his partners run a gas station and garage. ' We're interested in businesses other than that gas station? How can I talk about what someone else does? I'm sorry. That would be repeating a rumour. Oh, what a ham! - No. He's doing pretty good. Was Joe Gray ever a partner of Mr Mancani? The $64 dollar question. I don't know. Oh, he should've ducked that one. What? Are you a lawyer now, or something? We're on TV, so everyone's a lawyer. I know perjury when I hear it. When did you last talk to Joe Gray? - When he got back from the war. 'What did you talk about on that occasion? - I don't know. 'Hard to remember - It was a long time ago. ' 'That part is true. It was a long time ago. 'A long time ago... ' How does it feel to be back in the old home town? New York is your home town, isn't it? It was. Will be again, I guess. I was through with New York. Yeah, but that was back there. Now you're back here. It makes a difference. You did apply to disembark here, didn't you? A few things I have to get cleaned up. Personal business. You run home and don't waste any time getting yourself elected. Good luck, sir. Thanks. So long, Mark. Be good, Joe. Hey, Joe! So long, Pete! So long, Joe. We'll be seeing you soon, huh? Very soon. I only have to spend a couple of days here. Well, so long. Hey, Captain, where you going? I thought you was coming home with us. Ain't you and Marte getting married in Padre's church and settle down? Ain't we going into business like we talked? Don't worry, Louis. Everything will go according to plan. Boy, you had me scared for a minute. So long, Captain. It wasn't a bad war, was it? Just ended too soon. - Ended too soon?! Oh, my aching back! Joe! Captain Gray! Joe... Oh, Joe... Are you all right? - Yeah. I'm Ok, Connie. I... I don't know what to say. Imagine me speechless! - Oh, you look great, Connie. Are you happy, honey? Oh, I was so proud of you standing there, talking to those other officers. I said to myself, "Get that Joe - best looking guy in the crowd." You tired, baby? Oh, no, Connie. I'm just trying to get used to being back home. - I know. You've changed a lot though, Joe. Your face is thinner and... you seem quiet... Connie... - Have I changed much? No. You haven't changed a bit. And we're going to make up for lost time. You're going to forget there ever was a war. You're only going to know there's me. Oh, we're going to start just where we left off, Joe baby! We're really going to live it up. You're home. Kid... Kid, am I glad to see you! That's my boy - that's Joe! Look at him. He looks good, huh? Well, he just had an ocean voyage. - Nicky, it's great to see you. Huh, wait a minute... Look at all the stars. How come you let those square heads blow you? - I forgot to duck. Tell all your old pals. They dropped by to have a drink with you. They're still the same. - Here he is! Hello, Joe. - It's good to see you, Joe! Joey, do you remember Judge Lawton? - Yes, I do. He's quit the Bench now and heads our legal department. Nice to see you. Very happy to be here on such an auspicious occasion! This is Louis Draper. - Louis. Quite a welcome you got! - It sure is! - Louis heads our tax department. Boy, you look Ok! - Hey, I like your ribbons! He didn't get those ribbons in a dance bar, I tell you that! C'mon, kid, everybody knows you Here he is, gentlemen. Hey, Judge! ...Eddie... Frankie. Here's our boy. You all know him. Don't he look great? What is this - a meet?! A conference, Joe, and these gentlemen are all my associates, colleagues. And everything that runs these days, we run. Look, when you left town, I was nothing but a bum with a million bucks. But what's a million bucks now? It's just peanuts. - Some peanuts! What we don't own outright, we control outright. We got New York locked tight. And Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington... What do you mean, you got? We GOT, that's what I mean. We got the parts of Florida that count, Chicago, Cleveland... Now, Las Vegas and Reno, Nevada, all the protected areas of the West Coast. Down here, New Orleans is ours as are parts of Texas and Arizona. You get it? I'm beginning to. In all those parts, slot machines, gambling establishments, big city horse books and wire services we own and run. How much did our horse book business do last year? Tell him. With straight playing and lay-offs, a little over 100 million. 100 million. There isn't that much money! Eddie, what was YOUR gross? - About 80 million. Eddie handles the slots all over the country. It must all be everything wide open. Well, if it ain't, we open it! Tell him. We have friends, we have enemies. A lot of cops and officials that don't care about a buck. But we work it all very high class. We keep lobbies in some state capitals and one in Washington. The lobbies people take care of our interests. They see that Honest John politicians don't throw a curve. We have publicity guys who build up our charity work, or keep our names out of it. And the campaign funds... - We give it to any candidate who'll take it. Some say no, but some say yes. We're in everything that people want. And we're all working together like that! Which finger is the Chicago Mob?! Don't say "finger" when you talk about me! - Why not? Cut it out, Joe. ...Sit down, Charley! He's got a right to ask questions. I called a meeting three years ago down at Hot Springs. Me, Charley, Larry and the others. Anybody come out alive?! - You bet. I made 'em two propositions. "What you want, I told him? To play cops and robbers or you want to go into business? There's a war on!" I told 'em. All the suckers got dough and nothing they can buy, no new cars, no new homes, nothing! They all wanted action. We give it all - plenty! And the man with the whiskers? Smart! "Pay the man with the whiskers his taxes!" I told them. "Pay Uncle Sam on every bit of dough he's got a chance of finding out about. "Let him pay you something back like we was chums." We got the best taxman, best lawyers. One misses, the other jumps in. I didn't know classy lawyers handled people in the rackets. They all fight for our business. And why? Because we're all retired and respectable citizens. Everybody wears a nice clean front. I'm in real estate, Charley's in oil, Sporty's an art dealer. He's got a plush showroom full of Rembrandts and Picassos. Everybody's got something that's strictly legal. Now, the boys and I, we got a little business to talk. Connie! This won't take long. ...Now he's all yours. You're gonna be so surprised! Captain, your new barracks! How do you like it? I supervised the job myself. I wanted everything to be just right for you when you came back. Joe, what is it? What's eating you? Joe, act like you're glad to see me! You're my guy, remember? ...Connie, I met a girl in France. Oh-h! So that's what it is! Is your conscience bothering you? Forget about it! I figured you'd meet lots of girls in France. Connie, this is THE girl. She saved my life the night I was wounded. After I got to know her, I fell in love with her. I would have written you about it, but I thought maybe that you'd... That I had found somebody else? I wasn't looking for anybody else, Joe. I'm gonna marry her, Connie. I hate to tell you like this. I'm sorry. Don't be "sorry" for me! I blame it on the war, like everybody does about everything else! Later on, I guess I'll wish you good luck, but... right now, I could kill you! Ok to come in? Sure. Ok. We got to have a drink together. Everything went smooth as silk and you, my boy, are set for life. Yeah, you are gonna be in the big money now, kid. When his mother was alive, I told her, "Don't worry about Joe. He'll be Ok. He's got his Uncle Nicky! "I will take care of him better than his old man would. "... Drink up! No, thanks, Nicky. Not just now. What's the matter with you? What's... what's the trouble, kid? Talk up! I'm leaving, Nicky. I don't want any cut. I don't fit in any more. Oh, a little too big for you, huh? Don't worry. It'll be bigger than that! You're gonna be a big guy! I don't want any part of the deal. I made up my mind long time ago, if I did come back, I was coming back to something different. It's not for me. Not any more. No? Well, uh... what's for you? I'm going legit, straight. You got something to do with this? - Not a thing! You know too much now. You can't just walk out. You know I'll never talk about what I know. Nicky, there's nothing personal in this. You've been in the rackets, figuring the angles since you was a kid. Now you expect me to believe you want to be a chump! Why?! - I lived with chumps the past four years. Real chumps. Chumps enough to like the way they live. Even big enough chumps to fight and die for. - Ok, hold the soap box. You're gonna do what I say! What I say! So long, Nicky. Bye, Connie. Did you and Mancani put up the money to make Joe Gray your representative in a slot-machine company? I refuse to answer! Did you personally invest the sum of $100.000 in the slot-machine company? - I don't know. Mr Pignatalli, the Chair directs you to answer, and I warn you... failure to do so will cause me to seek a citation for contempt from the United States Senate. I still refuse to answer. - How much did you take out of the slot machines? I didn't say I took anything out. I didn't say I was in on the deal. But you were in it and it was a rotten deal. You had slot machines all over the city... in stores opposite schools. Children lost their lunch money! You had boxes put in front, so little ones could reach to put money in! Come on, you! You were the chief nickel-nurser. How much did it amount to? How much did you pay to politicians and corrupt police officials? I don't know. Yes, you do. When you go down the scale of evil men, there's none more evil than one who robs, exploits and corrupts the innocent mind of a child! How much silver did you sell your soul for?! I'm not saying anything. - The Chair is directing you to answer this question. No answer! You must some day answer to this transgression, this transgression of the rule of all good men to protect the young. You defied the rules of our Lord and the rules of our country! Never in all my years have I looked on one so low as he would fatten and batten on such unholy food! I nudged you with my knee. Why didn't you answer the simple ones? - Why should I tell him anything? To give the impression you're co-operating with the Committee. He was just trying to needle me! Robbing kids! What am I, their fathers and mothers?! Your answer on Joe Gray wasn't very wise. - Look lay of me, tell it to Nicky! That was his idea. "Gotta be smart, gotta be smooth!" We also gotta sweat in case Joe gets mad and starts talking. In the old days, he wouldn't be able to talk! Joe's all bottled up. Don't worry about him. - Hear that? Don't worry! We're being very, very smart. Maybe so smart we ALL wind up in jail! I don't like it. I trust nobody! And nobody trusts you, sweetie pie, so that makes it even! Dinner's ready. Come and get something to eat. I don't WANT anything to eat. - We got broiled senators on toast! Sounds pretty good to me! - Mr. Grant keep her company. I don't want no company! Charley will be up when he feels better. - Oh, good! Joe! Marte! Why didn't you let me know you were coming? Oh, I came by plane this morning. Our children are all right. This isn't gonna be very pleasant for you. Oh, I don't care about that, Joe, as long as I'm with you. I'm glad you're here, Marte. If a man's in trouble, his wife should be with him. I'll get you registered and tell boy to take your baggs. Hey, why don't you look where you're going?! Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realise! - It's all right. I should have watched where I was going. It's all my fault. You got the connecting room, Simon. Hello. Simon Andrews? Who is it? A cab driver. Did you just come up from the court building? I found a wallet in the cab. Just a minute... Simon, where's your wallet? - Right here. I must have lost it! - It's his, all right. Can you bring it up? I can't leave my cab, mister. I'm right outside the hotel. End of the line. Ok, sir, I'll be looking for you. Cab number 149. You the fella that found a wallet? I don't know anything about a wallet! Hey, looking for a wallet? Yeah. Over here. Ok, Gray, the boss wants to talk to you. Don't get cute or you'll get hurt. Go on in, Gray. He's waiting for you. Hello, Joe. What kind of a dumb deal is this?! - Relax. I just wanna talk. - About what? They're gonna sweat you pretty good on the stand. You saw to that today! - I wanna make a deal. I don't want any deals! - Maybe I can change your mind. Your wife's coming up, too. She's right behind you. Maybe with her here, you will wanna make a deal. Oh, I hope nothing happened. There's a car in the alley. She doesn't like it, Joe. She's trying to get away! Charley, NO! Come here. I told you what?! I tried to make a deal. He wouldn't go for it! - I said no! Upstairs! Go on! You - oh-oh! You must be pretty dumb to fall for an old gag like that! I'm surprised at you. You know Charley! When he gets nervous, he develops bad tendencies. You want a drink? No, I think I'll go back to the hotel. I don't want Marte to worry. I don't come in when I come in - you don't go back to no hotel! You down on the sidewalk with a whole crowd around you trying to figure out did he jump or did he fall? - I know that. Thanks. - Uh-uh! Charley's nervous! He's afraid you're gonna talk. You can't talk, Joe. I got the hooks in you. No matter which way you turn, you're still on the hook! Remember that. But... maybe that's better than being down there, huh? Good night, Miss Williams. - Good night. Don't forget what I told you. - Oh, don't worry about me. They can ask me anything they like. I'll tell them anything I please. - As you will. Joe! Connie... - Outside! What're you doing? - Don't play dumb! C'mon, let's get it over with. If you got something to say, say it! If you haven't, it's my turn to brush you, remember? Yes, I remember. You know what they're trying to do. You're gonna help them, aren't you? Well, aren't you?! I don't know anything about anything and you'd better stick to the same tune! Going down? You drink this about every 20', you won't worry about anything! I only worry about one thing, Charley. I'm not smart. Somebody say you were? That's pretty good! But why should they? What I mean, Charley, is I handle all kinds of money for you boys. Keeping money. None of it is keeping money from me. You get paid. Sure, but not off the top. Now, if I was cut in... Wait! Why should YOU be cut in? To keep me happy. I might be called as a witness at this hearing. And? I can forget everything I know... if I'm happy. You need somebody on your side around here. Nicky's Ok, but... - You said it. Nicky's Ok, but... "But" is right. I'll take care of this, my friend. I'll never forget it, Charley. All right. I'll talk to Nicky tomorrow. Tonight's no good with him. I'll take care of this. I want you to remember this. Whatever you get, you're gonna get it from Charley Pignatalli, nobody else. I'll remember. - Tomorrow, you'll be Ok. I really think I deserve it, don't you? - Sure. A man that keeps quiet deserves anything. And you're gonna be very happy and very quiet after tonight. Draper... this is from Charley. Miss Connie Williams. Raise your right hand, please. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? - I do. Can't you stop those fellas before I go blind?! I think you've had enough pictures for now, gentlemen. All right mr. Foster. - Your name is Connie Williams? - That's right. Miss Connie Williams. - Miss Williams, do you know Nicky Mancani? Yes, I know him. - You know his present whereabouts? How could I? I'm his friend, not his nurse. As a friend, do you know? Certainly not. He could be any place. Did you know that Morris Draper was found murdered this morning? Yes, I knew him. But I don't know where he is now either! How well did you know Draper? He did some income tax reports for me, that's all. A book-keeper. You've had some investigation of your tax returns, haven't you? Are you kidding? I've been questioned by so many taxmen, I think they break the new ones in on me! Tell us the source of your income, miss Williams. Here we go again. I play the races, I bet on basketball or football. Some fellas I know give me tips. Sometimes I win, sometimes I lose Is that your sole source income, young woman? Fellas give me money and presents, just like a lot of fellas give a lot of girls presents and money! You're rather well known for the parties you give. - I like parties! I give 'em to get my friends together or because I feel like it! Don't everybody give parties? Don't senators? You spent over $14.000 in Miami... in two weeks. - Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. Can you tell us the names of some of these fellas for whom you've arranged these parties? Nobody special. I don't burn up my own money feeding these freeloaders. If you pay the bills, I'll give YOU a party. She ought to be an actress! - Radio comedian. Do you know Joe Gray? - Sure. I know him. Did he give you money, too? - Sure. Cars, jewellery, fur coats, everything. What's Joe Gray's business? - I don't know his business. You seen him lately? Not since he's been married, about five years ago. He hasn't given me any money since then or any presents, in case you and his wife are worrying about it. Or any tips on horses or bascetball games? - How could he? I haven't talked to him or even heard anything about him. She's covering him up! She's supposed to refuse to answer. She's nervous. That's all. Here's a list of the gambling places that you bet with. I don't know anything about those places! But you've made wagers by telephone with them, miss Williams. Maybe I did bet. I don't know. They wasn't all in one place, I try another. Some of those places are a name, and that name is Joe Gray, isn't it? If Joe Gray had anything to do with those places, I'd never bet with them! Sounds as if you dislike him. You finally caught on! I don't like him. He's just a fella I use to knew! She's covering him up! I thought she was smart! - Quiet. You never heard even any rumours about him in connection with the places on this list? No, I did not. She's still stuck on him. Listen to her. Any further questions, Mr Foster? - No. - Senator? Gracious, no! I've no more questions! Let her step down. About time. Oh, for heaven's sake! Get out of here. Let me out. Get me Judge Lawton's office. - I got a question. How come I'm the only one to put the finger on Joe? And Conny protect him all the time. - Judge Lawton, please. Nicholas Mancani. Hello, Ben. - Mr Mancani? Do you think it wise to call it? Oh? Oh. Yes. Tell them I'm sorry I didn't know about it sooner... I will be glad to appear tomorrow, or any time. That's right. Just got in town. MANCANI APPEARS TODAY Wants to Co-oprate with Senate Committee. Will answer all Questions Mr Mancani, are you financially interested in any gambling enterprises? I refuse to answer that question on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate or degrade me. If the question means gambling activities prior to six years ago, beyond the statute of limitations... Prior to six years ago, were you in the gambling business, Mr Mancani? Prior to six years ago, I had some gambling interests, yes. Do you know Joe Gray? - Naturally. He's my nephew. Prior to six years ago, was Joe Gray part of your gambling deals? No harm in saying it. At that time, he was. You made a good deal of money during prohibition, didn't you? I made some. - You were a bootlegger. Didn't you know bootlegging was illegal? Senator Tower, I know there was law against it. It was an unpopular law. As a metter of fact, we bought a lot of applejack from farmers in your own state. You know that gambling is illegal? Yes senator, I know that, but... nobody can operate a gambling business unless people make bets with him. Anybody who runs a gambling business has got to have plenty of partners. People gonna bet. A lot of good citizens bet, you know. When did you last see Joe Gray? The day he came back to the States from the army. You've not seen him since? - No, I don't recall that I have. You know why he moved to Central City? My counsel tells me that I may refuse to answer the question. I don't want to answer questions about somebody else's activities. Are you a part of his activities? I refuse to answer that question, on the grounds that it might tend to incriminate or degrade me. Then tell us, without tending to degrade or incriminate yourself, what you can about the operations in Central City. 'It's an easy one for you to duck, Nicky. Tell 'em you know nothing about... What d'ya need, bud? - Fill her up. L&W? First time I've seen that round here. You new on this route? - Yeah, first trip. Say, where's Bremer's Warehouse? Turn at 48th Street. Right turn. - Thanks. 48th, right turn. We got special rates for truckers. Best lunch room this side of Chicago. You got quite a load back there. One-armed bandit, huh? One-armed bandits is right. - Hey, how much do one of them slots weigh? About 100 lb, empty. - They're always empty when I play' em! What do I owe you? 5.40 less 10, that's 4.86. - Keep it. Thanks. Want a bill for this? - No bill. Ok. Give us a try when you really need service. Yeah, yeah, sure. Come on. Let's go. I gave the guy our regulation 10 off for trucks. Might be a good customer. Hauling bandits? - What's he hauling? Slot machines. - Where's he going? Florida? - No, Bremer's Warehouse. Must have had 500 of them. 500 slots? Are you sure? - It's a 10 ton truck, loaded up. Bremer's has been closed for years. Well, it must be open for business now. That's bad. - What, Joe? Moving in slot machines. It's a big racket. Nickel and dime stuff! - Nickel and dime stuff, huh? Multiply 500 by 10. - 5.000. - Now by 7. - 35.000. Now by 52. That's 1.820.000. - That dollars? Yeah, dollars. Each machine must do $10 day, seven days a week for a year. The graft grows. Then they move in the punch boards. That's penny, nickel, dime and dollar stuff. That'll add up to a million a year, easy. Mamma mia! We're in the wrong business! - The wrong town. That's grocery money, gas and oil money. And it's only the beginning When you see slot machines, someone is taking crap for protection. We ought to put a couple in here, and pick up some of that easy dough too. Being with you guys made me wanna get out of the rackets, and now you wanna put me right back in. Clout him with a tire iron. Joe, I'm a little bit worried. - Anything special? This slot machine business is really growing. They have them all over town. - Yeah, they're doing it big. Can't you go to the mayor or the chief of police? Tell them what it means. - No... I can't. When I quit, I quit both ways. I won't help them, Simon, but... I can't be a stoolpigeon. - Goodnight, daddy! - Goodnight, little sight! Here... Are you ready to hit the trail, partner? Sure. Here we go! Hang on! Duck, partner! Left! Up the hill! Hello? Hello! Hello, Louis? What's the matter, kid? Can't you talk? I'm here, Louis. What is it? Joe, come on over quick! There's a couple of guys... Hello! Louis! You're a wise one, eh? Does it take two of you to whip him? - Shut up! Put one on each side of the jukebox. Girls, this play is for you. It might win you a buck or two. They hit him, Joe! Are you all right, Louis? - Yeah, Joe. - Easy, Louis. You think you're pretty rough. - We'll show you how tough we can be. There's trouble, all right! All right, all right, all right! All right! Now the machines! All right, get 'em in the car. How did it start? - I told him we didn't want the slots. He said they had a lot of pull around here. They could stop trucks from coming and ruin our business. He told me nacker off. The big guy shat me and I went to the phone. It's all very businesslike, isn't it? - Why not? It is a business. We have a very good checking system. That machine separates the coins. Each bag must weigh a certain number of pounds. We know how much per pound nickels are, dimes are, quarters... Then they come over here. They get a count of the rolls. Then they check one against the other? - They'd better check. Tommy, take those two machines up to the repair room. What happened? - We tried to locate the machines in a smart guy's place and he threw them out. - Threw us out - him and some other yokels. Don't tell me there's any trouble about locating the machines, Charlie. I understood there would be no strong-arm stuff. We don't wont anything so bad around. I know people at City Hall... Where was it? A service station run by a guy called Joe Gray. Were there many people there? - Commissioner, please, Nothing to worry about. A little window dressing, that's all. I will warn you boys. Rough you up a bit, did they? Good enough. - Well, here you are... Take care of Tommy, will you? Charge this one up to me. Joe Gray can't afford to have those machines in his place. Has to protect our friends, like the commissioner. To protect me? - Yeah, make him look good in case there's ever a question. Joe Gray's the boss of the outfit. He's the guy you're working for. So, Mr Mancani, you disclaim all knowledge or participation of any of Joe Gray's activities in Central City? Well, I know he lives there... and he does some kind of business there, but that's all I know. When were you in Central City last, mr. Mancani? To tell the truth, I never stayed overnight there. I just passed through once in a while on motor trips. - Try to remember exactly. Did you ever see Joe Gray on these trips when you just passed through? Of course not. If I did I would remember it. 'I remember it. I can't stop remembering it. ' Nick! Hello, kid. What are you doing here? I never thought I'd see you in this town. Oh, Marte... This is my wife. Marte. Hello. - Hello, Marte. You must excuse me for breaking in like this. I was just passing through. I thought I would come and see what kind of a niece I have. I'm your Uncle Nick. Yes, I know. Joe has told me about you. Ah. You're a nice-looking girl. It's a nice little place. You're looking good too. I hear you've got some little ones. - Yes, a boy and a girl. They're upstairs asleep. - Ah... All right if I take a peek? I don't want to disturb them. It's all right. - Sure. I'll take you up. Oh... that's some boy! Look at that! Looks like her - the wife. She's almost... Sh... We'll wake her up. They don't wake up that easy. How you been doin', Joe? - All right. I've got a nice little business going. Making money? Some. A nice little business... You must stick to it. - That's what I'm doing. You're busting into mine. Oh... I see. That's why you're here. Charley was pretty steamed up about what happened last week here - you harassed a couple of our boys. They tried to move in on me, slugged my buddy. - I know about it. You know how it is when you move into a new location. There are always arguments. You're moving in here? This is a kind of small town for a big operation like yours. I thought you just went for the big spots. Things change. We don't operate on only the big towns. Now we have the little ones in-between. They link up. How did you get sent here? The usual way. I bought protection Oh, you know... But right now, we could use a little help. No, Nicky. Count me out. Not for me, never mind me. But a lot of your old friends are in on this. Nicky, my real friends are here. They're the people you're going to hurt, the people of this town. I'm not going to help you do that. - Ok, don't help. But don't stand in our way! - Let's get this straight, Nicky... I don't want any part of your deal, or anything to do with anybody that has any part of it. You're a lucky guy. You've got a nice home, wife, kids... You got a lot to lose. Take my advice... Don't try to stop us. On any of these trips, did you look over any of the gambling outfits there the slot-machine company, the casino, the lay-off officers? No reason for me to do that. But you do know there are such places runing there? Oh, I'd heard there was, but I can't swear it's true. Just tell us what you do know about gambling in that city. 'You ought to tell him, senator. You knew all about it. MAJOR "BILL" STEPHENS OPEN CAMPAIGN Gambling Foe to Expse Billlion Dollar Racket in Rally Speech Most of us gamble on something, a little bridge, a little poker, a day at the racetrack - but some of you place your $2 bet on a horse with a bookmaker, give it to the man on the cigar stand or to someone in the office who knows someone who will take a bet. That $2 bet seems like a small thing. But that $2 bet and the nickel slot machine are two things I wanna talk about. These two apparently harmless actions, practised by people who think they are law-abiding, provide a crime syndicate in the United States with over $20 billion a year in revenue. 20 billion! There are other national sources of revenue pouring into that same stream. The punchboard, the numbers racket... sweepstake tickets... the football-pool tickets and wages... That stream of revenue permits these hoodlums to corrupt politicians, police officers, judges, and even up to the higher echelons of public servants. These hoodlums do this by contributing to election funds and campaign funds. These people deal in evil... and murder. They do their deeds for money. And when you gamble with them, you are their partners. Partners in a system that leads to crime, corruption and murder. I want you to remember that. I want you to think that over. I want you, instead, to become my partners... and fight this vicious system. You were great, skipper, great! - Thank you, Louis. Hello, Simon. - Hello, Bill. It's quite a surprise seeing you all here. When we heard you were opening up your campaign, we thought we'd get you off to a good start. Thanks... - Joe said, "Let's hear what the old man has to say." It was a great speech, Bill. - Joe... Mrs Stephens took me up to see the children. They're adorable. The big one woke up. How old is he? Mike, he's 10. - He looks at his mother and asks, "How did Papa do?" When Alice said "fine", he answered "good" and went back to sleep. How many do you have, Bill? - Three. Mike and the two girls. Let's get to the food. What's the sense of saving it?! So you liked what I said tonight, huh? Yeah, I liked it. - I meant it, Joe. I know you did, Bill, and I think you got a lot of votes tonight. You got mine. I'll even make a campaign contribution. I'm not gonna stall around about this, Joe. You're pretty smart, coming here and telling me what a great speech I made and that you'll contribute to my campaign fund. Is that smart? - Joe... you're part of what I'm fighting. - You're wrong. As wrong as a man can be. No, I'm not. You're running pretty strong in Central City, Joe. All I'm running is a gas station and a garage. What about the Flowers Club? - What about it? - I understand it's yours. I've never been in it. - And Blinky's Book? I've heard of it. - You own it, or part of it. You're in on the slot-machine deal a partner. - Bill, you're not talking sense! You rent six notorious houses around the Sportsman's Bar and Grill. I don't even know where the Sportsman's Bar and Grill is! All right, forget it. If you don't own or operate any of these places, you bring me the Joe Gray that does and I'll apologise. I'd better be getting back to the others. The boys will think I'm making a deal with you. Alice, do they look like the boys I've been talking about all these years? The best patrol in the army! Paesano! We'd better get started back, honey. Hello. - I'm afraid I don't know you, sir. What's the name? Gray. Joe Gray. - Oh, Mr Gray... Excuse me. I'm sorry, Mr Gray. Come right in. How do you do, Mr Gray? How are you, sir? - Fine. I expected to see you around here long before this. Hello, Joe. - Hello, Lonnie, when did you get into town? About three months ago. I wanted to look you up, but they told me that wasn't the way we were doing it. Glad to see you, Joe. Meyers is in the cashier's office. Doing wonderful. Just doing wonderful. I've got the books here to show you. This is the weekly tally. We burn this every week. Of course, we're losing money on the restaurant, but that's in another set of books. I figured it was. How are you handling my cut? Like I was told. Pollack picks it up every night, when we close. Something wrong, Mr Gray? No, nothing's wrong. - I didn't think so, with Pollack handling it. Well, I just thought I'd look things over. Much obliged. So long. - So long, Mr Gray. And if there's anything wrong... - Goodnight. I'd like to know how the bills are paid at those addresses. The meter's in the name of Joe Gray. I thought they were. All on the first by cash... I see. Thank you very much. I'm just checking on Gray's credit. What's up? You've been on that phone all day. Gonna buy some real estate? Look Louise, can go home, I look up a while? I wanna go out for a little while. - Sure, sure. As a matter of fact, I may be gone all afternoon. Go out and enjoy yourself. We'll make it. I don't believe you know me, Chief Tayls. I'm Joe Gray. No. I know a lot about you. What's on your mind? I find that my name is tied into some things that are going on in this town. So do I, Mr Gray, and if I had my way, I'd throw the book at you. We have an anti-gambling squad and a vice squad that's supposed to do that job. I just run a desk, instead of running you and all your kind in. The only business I have is a gas station. I want you to understand that. I know you want me to understand that. I've been on this force 22 years, and I and a lot of others on here are just waiting to get our hands untied. Then we'll show you and your mob that we understand how to take care of the lot of you. Get out of here! And don't you ever come back in here until they bring you in with cuffs on you! Ricky's bookmaking joint, the slot machine outfit... I'm tied into everything, like Bill Stephens said. Wherever you look, you find Joe Gray. But those signatures will be forgeries. Yeah, but good forgeries And all the grapevine talk has me tagged as the boss. What are you gonna do about it? Get out of this town. And tell no-one where we're going. You don't mean we have to leave our home, leave our friends, leave here because we are afraid? No, Joe, we can't do that. - What else can we do? We'll stay here. You told me so many times that people have no fear in this country, that the cause is just, that a man's rights are protected always. What do you think? - She's right, Joe. Of course I am right. We have people here who know us, like Simon, like the boys. They'll help us in our trouble. If we run away from here now, we'll be like the poor people on the roads during the war. They left their homes to go out and die in strange places. It didn't help them to run, Joe. It's not going to help us. What about the racing wire service that goes there, the lay-offs that are handled? I'm retired, senator. I hear this and I hear that, but I can't be sure if what I hear is true. In that regard, Mr Chairman, I'd like to say something to the witness. We can't tell from your testimony what's true and what's not true either. We know that words are frequently woven into a web to deceive, and we know that the signs of deception are sure signs that anyone with any sense can feel! Your evasions, sir, have about them, the smell of falsehood and the stench of lies! You pretend you want to aid us in finding the truth. And I say pretend! Because no such purpose. Mr. Mancani, we're not misled by your manner, impressed by your arrogance, nor beguiled by your plausibility. I know that at this moment, you feel victorious, you feel like a winner. A slimy tricky man of cleverness and cupidity, but so far as I'm concerned, sir, you are so apparent, that your artifice and your guile serve only to show the shallowness and the stupidity of one who tries to confound the truth with smirks and grimaces and a tawdry imitation of frankness and sincerity! We're not yet done with you, mr. Mancani. You may step down, Mr Mancani. The committee will adjourn at this early hour to permit its members to meet in executive session tonight The meeting is adjourned. If he didn't like that tongue-lashing, it'll only make him tougher tomorrow. If you give the impression he's covering up for me, he'll get me in deeper. Suppose you get on a stage and tell the truth. Stephens wouldn't believe it. He has cheques made out to me, records of payrolls - all rigged, but... all convincing. There must be some way you can prove they're wrong. Stephens thinks he can get Nicky through me. Mancani lied about not seeing you in Central City. How can I prove it? Let me tell that he did come to our house. No, I can't get you mixed up in this. I know what they're like. Why can't they leave us alone? When you know too much, they won't let you get out. I'm afraid of a lot of things - things I've told Simon, but no-one else. Not even you. Have you made up your mind what you want, Simon? I'm not hungry, Joe. I'd kind of like to be alone. Will you be Ok? I can see better without my eyes than most people can with them. Goodnight Marthi. - Goodnight. So I looked pretty good on television? - You were great. And I got no beef for the way you handled Joe. He was frying. That senator gave it to you pretty good, too. Well, he was very interesting to me. He has a large vocabulary. What is it? - Reverend Andrews to see you. He says he has some word from Joe Gray. Send him in. Is that the blind preacher from Central City? Yeah. Those Holy Joes always bring me bad luck! You better see him. Come in, please. - You're Mr Pignatalli? That's right. - Mr Mancani's not here right now. - Friend of mine... I know you're not alone and I'd like to talk to you privately. Sorry, boys, this is private. I would rather meet with nine cross-eyed black cats than bump into one of those crows! Every time I see one, something bad happens. What can I do for you, Reverend? I'm not asking for anything from you and Mr Mancani. I'm demanding it. Strong talk, mister. I'm not frightened by you or any of your people. I know a lot about you, mr. Pignatalli! Unless you right the wrong that you have done Joe, I'm going to ask Bill Stephens to let me testify, and tell him what I know. What'll you tell? That Joe's a good boy, he goes to church? I'll tell how you took over the racing wire, what happened to Jelly Cohen, where the bottle money's cached and how much it is! I'll tell what I think happened to Draper, and I'm gonna prove that Mancani perjured himself when he said he didn't see Joe in Central City. Shell I go on? You can prove it? - The FBI can prove, cos' I'll tell 'em where to start. Joe wouldn't do that. He has some idea about loyalty to Nicky Mancani! I have no such idea! Did Joe send you up here? - Joe and no one knows that I'm here. You framed Joe. They won't believe him, but they'll believe me! Preacher, it looks like you've got me over a barrel. Nothing I can say but yes. We'll clear Joe. That's all I want, but you're gonna start clearing him tomorrow! Eh, this way is closer. You don't mind if we handle this in our own way? All I want to know is that it's done. - All right. You can tell Joe that it's settled. I'll talk to Nicky tonight. Operator, would you take this gentleman down, please? All we had to go on was this hotel key, so we called the hotel. Is it... Simon? Being blind, your friend probably stepped into the open shaft. It's an easy place to have an accident. Is there anything else you want from me? No, sir. If be, we call you. Poor Simon seemed so sure of his steps! It wasn't an accident. They killed him. - They wouldn't! They did. I want you to go back home right away. But you'll be alone... - You've got to get out of here. Take the first plane out. - I can't leave you now! Don't go back to the hotel to pack. Go right to airport. When you get home, tell Dawsons to stay in the house with you and the kids. Oh, Joe! Driver, take this lady to LaGuardia Airport. She's in a hurry. Driver, I'm not going to the airport. Please take me to the Federal Building. Hurry up. Is Senator Stephens here? - Does he expect you? No... I'm Mrs Gray. I must see him. Hello, Marte. - I'm permitted to come here? Is it all right? - Of course! Come and sit down. - Thank you. I came to tell you that... that Simon is dead. Simon? Dead? But... how? - Joe said he was killed. Murdered. Why? Why would anyone want to kill Simon? Because he believed my husband is honest. Because he wanted to help him. He gave his life for him. You don't think my husband is honest. Maybe you won't understand why... Simon did. Simon always did believe in Joe. And... you never will? I can't. In the face of his past, the records... the testimony. Marte, I'd like to... I'm sorry, Miss Williams, the boss said he wasn't to be disturbed, not to let anybody in. You don't think he meant me, do you? Why don't you call, see if it's all right? You should have been a traffic cop! The boss tells me to do something, I do it. You can't call me a cop for that. Well, that was smart! Joe, listen, get out of here! They're looking for you. - I'm not supposed to be spunki. Is Nicky in there? Don't let him see you! Joe, listen to me! You're walking right into it! 'I know you killed him! Let loose of Charley! Nobody killed nobody! ' Just because some fella had an accident... It wasn't an accident! You killed him! - How can you say a thing like that to me, or to Charley? Information? Get me Senator Stephens' office in the Federal Courts Building. Hurry, it's a emergency. I... I want you to let me testify. The others want to make my husband ashamed by saying what his life was. I want to make him proud when I tell how decent, how honest his life is now Marte, I'll consider calling you. I want to tell how Mancani lied today. While he was on the stand? - Yes. He did come to Central City, he did see Joe. I heard them talk. I am not afraid. I want to tell everything that happened that night. I'm sorry, Senator, but there's a call I think you ought to take. Excuse me. Yes?.. Who? Connie Williams. Joe Gray is here now... In Mancani's office! I've got a tape recorder going, getting everything they're talking about... Upstairs in the study. I'll show you when you get here. Yes, I see... I will. He's in bad trouble. Hurry, please. Cool down. I had to tie you in on those deals, otherwise something much worse would have happened to you. Try to make everybody be nice, everybody wants to be rough. Oh, Connie. Come in, come in. Say hello to one of your old playmates. What are you doing here? Connie, Joe says we are all bad people and we tried to do an accident to some friend of his. I didn't know you and Draper were friends! Don't be making dumb cracks! We're talking about somebody else. Draper's no news! I don't want to be any part off jobs yuo pull. Draper asked for it! Did Simon ask for it? Is that why you killed him? You told that Holy Joe too much about us. He was gonna talk. Charley and I don't like people that squeal, and nieder do I. I knew it was you. I'm gonna nail you and your whole mob! You're too smart to do anything like that. You don't know what you're saying, you just cut. I'm gonna talk, Ncky! I'm gonna spill everything I know. All bottled up? He'll blow the whole thing wide open! He's just blowing off steam! You couldn't do that to me. We go too far back for that. You've changed. You think you're bigger than anyone in the world! No matter how fancy you talk or how legal you say you are... inside, you're a killer. And that's all you are. You're like Charley. Anyone gets in your way, you push! Nicky! Joe don't mean that! He's just upset... Nicky! - Get him! Maybe that will remind you when you was a kid, when I bought your food, when I sent you to school! When I... took care of you! Ok. You don't wanna be smart... good! Let him be dumb! No, Nicky! Don't do it! You can't! Stephens knows he's here! So what? So we all saw him go up to his room with Brinkley. So he killed himself because he was afraid of what would come out in the investigation! - They won't believe it. because they've heard every word that's been said in this room! How do you know that? Hm? How do you know that? They're upstairs right now in your study, listening in. You got an ear rigged up in here?! - Wait! Why didn't you tell me this before we spill everything? Before. You let them in. Connie... you crossed me up? Why? On account of Joe, Connie? You crossed me up on account of Joe?! Joe... So they're listening in? Alright, let 'em hear this! Who's Joe Gray? - I'm Joe Gray. We got a call from Senator Stephens. What's going on here? Ask him. He's dead. Asking him won't do no good. Joe Gray. For the record, I would like to state that we have positive proof that Joe Gray was a victim of his former associates. I would like to say here that we'll need the help of Mr Gray as we'll need the help of all of you if we're to break this corrupt and ruthless gang of hoodlums. Laws are not enough. There'll be other Mancanis and Pignatellis if you permit it. Only you can stop it. The committee, Mr Gray, has revoked your subpoena. As chairman of this committee, we regret the pain and embarrassment you have been caused. And to this, Joe, I would like to add my public apology for the personal injustice I've done you for so long Simon always told me I was wrong about you, but he had to lose his life to prove it to me. Forgive me, Joe. Call the first witness, please. - Silky Tanner.
