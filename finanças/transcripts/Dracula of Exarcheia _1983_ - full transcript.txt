The Dracula of Exarchia Laying supinely against the rail tracks and the moon over me is lit Night, Winter, Apnoea Mournful music And I'm a carcass, alive and waiting Images of fake loves and beaches my last cigarette is bitten Junkies and ticket conductors, hysteric grannies From the rails into my veins the screeching of the brakes So, do something! Help me miss the train ... Do something! Help me miss the train ... Aphroditen, play Taking Heads, Remain In Light Second Song on the first side Ya! Stonehead, stop frowning, I can see you! Give it some primes and increase the volume That's it. Ya! Excellent! Very nice! That's exactly what we need! Just a bit more oriental... Aphroditen...

Listen to the dead lieutenant that fought in Albania I was made into a poem by Elitis I won't be unburied by any Average Joe We need to repel that ruthless orthopedist Victor Papadopoulos that has deprived our community of its most precious parts and by the term "parts" This is what I mean... Both hands of Jimmy Hendrix Seven fingers of Manolis Chiotis And the trunk of Manos Hatzidakis We have to face the problem overall, comrades. It would be a terrible mistake if we draw any conclusions judging solely by our personal problems and the problems of our own cemetery I understand your worries But let us not forget that besides all odds... ... we have at least a grave while thousands of comrades from Chile to Poland stay unburied and rot I condemn the attempt of political exploitation... ... and disorientation, by the previous speaker In Poland Comrade, ... ... it's not the regime to blame that corpses stay unburied ... which on the contrary, implements a necrophiliac policy ... ... but due to the imperialist secret agents ... ... which create an orgy of grave robbing and vandalism We don't care about the political differences of the previous speakers Let's face the reality eat the living ones! Right now! There's one solution: Vote for Virginia! Comrades... Calm down I have a very clear proposal that will help us communicate our problems to the world I suggest that we organize a festival and a protest concert having on stage the band that has been created by Victor with the stollen limbs that belong to our Comrades Let us set aside all minor differences, Comrades to confront with the vast problems of our field I absolutely agree! Let us be united! Let us abduct the band from Victor's Laboratories Let's stand up for out rights! Stand up, damned of the Earth ... Stand up, prisoners of hunger, Reason thunders in its volcano, This is the eruption of the end ... The placard reads: "Back to graves" Where the hell have you been? Did Juliet go to sleep? She did after watching the news Good! Stonehead, Aphroditen, come this way How I hate racism and niggers This time I'm absolutely confident on my success We got the best parts! I'll create a top ten striker band in Europe and USA Fancy that! The fingers of Manolis Chiotis Manolis Chiotis fingers playing new wave Enough! Get back to work! Very interesting, huh? Is this a proper face for a singer? We don't care about the looks moreon but the quality! Bring me the corpse of Manos Hatzidakis Careful, Manos Hatzidakis is too big to fit in there. For 48 hours they have to listen to the new trend in music We'll be checking every one hour whether the earphones work And we let musical hypnopaedia do the rest I'll fix your little hands ... ... your little legs ... ... and your head My sweet chubby, I'll turn you into the best singer Now I'll give you daddy's batteries ... and if you wake up, we'll leave to travel around the world This clock is really weird it strikes whenever it wants Interesting Bfff!
