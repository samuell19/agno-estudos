Of course it??s wrong. Fuck! Pick the bun up. What is the matter? Stop fighting! I let you go this time. If you say it again... I will beat the shit out of you. Children, come back and eat. Your grandma asked me to bring you soup. What are you looking at? Go eat. Hello, Principal. How can you start a fire here? It is no big deal. Don??t worry. There are lots of students. It??s dangerous! It??s okay. There won??t be a fire. I??m here. What if the house catches fire? It??s wooden. Don??t worry. No. No. Please leave. No worries. Come... One bowl for one person.

What happened? Did You fall in a ditch? Why are you so muddy? Go take a bath! Go! Madame. Water. Is it hot? Yes. I say we boil water for them everyday... Let??s not do anything. Why are you so dirty in the first day of school? No bags. Just take their shoes and hats. Get dressed. Dinner is ready. Withstand hardships. Work with our shovels. Shovel the ground, build the roadway, pave the road with gravel. Hey, you are so annoying. Grind through the ground along railways. Quiet. Or Grandma will be angry. Grandma. I don??t know this one. Teach me! What? I don??t understand this one. It says there are three chickens in a cage. Three chickens. The other cage has five rabbits. And then, two chickens in the cage... are put into the rabbit cage. Two chickens are in the rabbit cage. And four rabbits in the rabbit cage... are put into the chicken cage. Four rabbits are in the chicken cage. So, how many feet are in the chicken cage? How many feet in the rabbit cage? Let me do the math. What??s the answer? How to do it? Why do they put the rabbits to the chicken cage? I don??t know the reason either. Grandma, they are fighting! Who are fighting? Don??t fight. Don??t fight. Get up. What are you fighting for? Stop! You two are older and should stop them. They wouldn??t listen. Airight. What??s wrong with your eyes? Who hit you? Did you do this? Not me. Then who did it? Somebody had to do it! I don??t know, Grandma. You don??t know. Let me see. The medicine is here. Ok. Wait. I will cast a spell first. Grandma, sorry to keep you waiting. I know children have quarrels sometimes. But, Principal, look. This was quite a punch! My kid would be blind if it was harder! I don??t want to make a fuss. I just want you to warn them. To settle the scores and bury the hatchet. Whatever your reason is, apologize first. It??s wrong to hit people. Is that right, Madame? Yes. You are right. Bees. Ma??am Sorry. Do you want to go outside and rest? Or go back first? I will take care of this matter. All right, I am going home. Children, stay. Help me drive bees out of the room. Quick! You take care of the door. Principal, stand over there. No hurry. Slowly.

I am Mrs. Wang. Mistress. The general is back! He is back! He is in Kao Hsiung now. How is his condition? The doctor said he??s fine. Come inside. I will wait here. Wait for me. How is he? When did he arrive in Taiwan? His shoulders are hurt. It??s not serious. He??s in the military hospital in Kao Hsiung. Mother, I might stay there for a while. We only have these left. Safe keep them. I say... Take this. No, mother. You might need it. No. Take it. The government will take care of us. I will bring him back when he??s better. I am leaving. Take care. What??s the noise? Nuts! Hurry up! Hurry up! What are you looking at? You will be like me when our troops come. Give me a popsicle. I will die gratefully. Don??t talk. Bummer. Ma??am, you are so clever! Put a tub of water under the sun. The boys can have a hot shower when coming home. So smart. Yes. What are you laughing at? Stop the kids when they are back. They can??t escape this time. The water will turn cold again. Yang, did you send the letter I gave you? Yes. I sent it. Ok. Guang He, who are you giving it to? Guang Qi. Hurry up! Hurry up! Can I use it please? My brother will bring me the inkstone later. Please! No! You use mine every time! Please. This is the last time. I??ll show you my dad??s shotgun after school. I don??t believe you. Teacher. No talking. Quiet! Practice calligraphy. Grandma. I am not buying it. Why do you need an inkstone of your own? Grandma. Please. I can??t cut the hair like this. I might cut off Guang Fu??s ears. We run and pass the inkstone every time. Other students have their own instones. Other students get an A in writing. You never get an A and I never yell at you. We already have two big inkstones and a bronze ink box. We have enough for you. Take turns. Or ask your mom when she??s back. Grandma, I can??t run for it anymore. I can??t play during breaks and still can??t finish my work. Don??t argue with me. Ask your teachers to rearrange your classes! This school is ridiculous. Grandma, you are pulling my hair out. Sorry. See. A lot to buy. Where??s the money? Ok. Go play. Grandma, we are having a sports event next week. All the parents are coming. Good. The teacher says you are in the PTA. So you have to go. Okay. I will go. Then you have to provide the prize. Why? The teacher says each grade has our kids. So we have to bring silk banners. How many? How much will that cost? Your school asks you to buy so many things! Desk pads, inkstones... And now silk banners! Isn??t this pretty? Pretty. These are from Mei Li Lu, A Ji Chang and Yi Lian Chang. Their parents gave these to us. The principal asked me to thank them. Hopefully other students requested... will bring the prizes to the school soon. Ma??am, the sports event is coming. Many parents ordered silk banners from me. Have some tea. What do you think? How much is it? Thirty dollars. Thirty dollars? Ok. Let me think about it and the number. I will be back. I can give you some discount. Are these paintings? Underneath, maybe. Yes, this one. Unfold it, so I can take a look. Unfold it. Stand back. Ma??am, this is different. It is a sports event. This is too big. Let??s look at another one. Grandma, we are back. What is this? How is it? Not bad, right? This is called recycling and saves money. What? Grandma, the old marks are too obvious. It looks awful. Yea, and the material is falling apart. This looks awful. Grandma, can it be smaller? You are picky. I??ve been busy all day. I didn??t even drink water. Shush. Stop whining. Go wash your dirty feet outside. They smell awful. Look at this great flag. You are being picky! I promise you it??s presentable. Go! Ma??am. The general is back! What? The general is back. How is he? He??s good but with his shoulders bandaged. I see. Sorry, sister Ma. My son just got back from the hospital. So I can??t... It??s ok. I am going next door. Bye. Ok. Bye. Tidy up. Mother brought the kids back. Don??t stand there. Come see your dad. Guang Hui and Guang Jie are still at school. Grandma told us to line up. The younger ones are in elementary school. Come.

Good. Come. Take your shoes off. Come. I am Guang Chi. What grade are you in? Fifth grade. Fifth. You aren??t much taller. Eat more so that you can get taller, ok? Keep it in mind. Dad, do you want to try this? What is this? Guava. Can you eat this? The neighbor gave this to us. You are? Guang Chiang. Guang Chiang, what grade are you in? lam a first grader. First grade! A starter. Work harder! Yes. Come up and take your shoes off. You are Guang He? Yes! Study hard. Work hard. Hi, Dad. Guang Fu, you are the eldest. Take care of your siblings. Good. Come up. Let your dad rest. Take your shoes off. Have some rest. Come eat dumplings. What are you doing here? Telling ghost stories. Ok. No more stories. Eat the dumplings. Who is down there? Get out. I don??t wanna go out. It??s scary. Don??t be afraid. Come out. Dad is home. If you don??t behave, you??ll get a smack. Are you used to here, mom? Yes. I am used to everything. Great. Thank you. When I just got here, I felt dizzy sometimes. Probably because of seasickness. I ran by feet before. I took boat this time. Not a comfortable ride. Maybe next time I??ll flee by flight. No, mom. This place is good, with electricity and tap water. Only it??s too hot, and too many mosquitoes. Eat. Why aren??t you eating? You are all growing. You should eat more. Thanks, dad. Ninth grade. Seventh grade. Eighth grade. No. Guang Hui is in ninth grade. Guang Jay is in eighth. Guang Fu is in sixth grade. Didn??t you just ask them this afternoon? Do you not remember? Commander, we??d like to drink a toast to you. We wish you a speedy recovery. Take us back to our hometown soon. Don??t call me that. We are civilians now. I shouldn??t drink, so I??ll drink this. Thank you. Thank you for looking after my family. Too bad Fu Shun isn??t here. Lieutenant Feng. Yes. Advisor Ma has a job for you. Are you interested? Commander, I want... I want to be a civilian, like you. I like being a civilian. Bottoms up! You needn??t drink though. To civilians. We will talk about it later. Thank you, commander. Twinkle twinkle little star, when brothers and sisters... You are so good today. Look. Grandma has a new invention! New invention? Wha is it? desk pads. Your handwriting will be improved with it. The teachers will give you good marks. Come on, everyone gets one. What has grandma invented? Xray films. Xray films! So many bends and curves. How to look at it? Are these bones here? Yes! They are all lined up! Are these real bones? Yeah, look at here. Look! There??s a bullet hole! Where? This is where the bullet came in. Brother. If it had been a little further, it would have shot the heart. My dad??d have been KIA and gotten a medal. What is KIA? Dummy. It means killed in action. Let??s switch. I don??t want to. I will buy it from you. Brother, sell it. Five cents! Give us a treat. Officers. Now I will talk about this mission... in great detail. We will leave this island for Mah Gong. After that we will gather on the sea and wait here until... We can reach our people inland. We proceed based on their intelligence. Leave us alone. We are at a meeting. Officers. According to our men inland... and the intelligence they provided... Madame, have some noodles. Okay. Yang, take these bowls and wash them. Ok. We are good here. Yes. Mother. Noodles are ready. Ok. Ok, kids. Eat some noodles! Still playing? The noodles are getting cold. Mother, I think there will be military action. Mr. Tong wouldn??t come afar this late if it??s not important. We are here in Taiwan. What more can we do? Mr. Chiang must have given instructions. Stay quiet and watch out. Don??t let Lieutenant Feng intrude. Let??s look at the deployment of the enemy. Come here, Guang Jay! What are you doing? No peeking. Go eat your noodles. Your dad will smack you if he sees you. Eat! Guang He, what did you see or hear? I saw dad held a huge map. He used a red pen circling things on it. He also used a magnifying glass. What are they doing? Don??t speak about it. This is a secret meeting. We are taking China back! Thank you, teacher. What? Wait, I??m looking for something. Take this as a souvenir. Because you are my good friend. If you swear not to tell, I will tell you a huge secret. I swear! Does it explode? No. We might be going back to China soon. You can??t tell anyone else. Ok. Why are you going to China? What about our summer plans? So when I get back, I will write to you first. Promise me you??ll write to me. Promise! I will write you letters! Can??t you say you haven??t recovered yet? Why do they always pick you? This is an order. I am a soldier! What kind of soldier are you? You??ve fulfilled your duty! You are a civilian! Millions of people are left there. We have to bring them here. Those areas belong to us! It??s not dangerous. The higher-up has thought it through. If something goes wrong, they will bring us back immediately. You have to take care of home. Yes. Won Jia Fen... Won Jia Fen... What? I have something for you. No! You always scare me with frogs. No, it??s a Christmas present. Thank you. Thank you. You??re welcome. Bye, Won Jia Fen. Goodbye. Welcome. Hello. Welcome here. Have some candy. One for each person. Thanks, little boy. It??s you, Sister Ma. I didn??t recognize you. You are an old man now. You are busy. Sorry, our whole family is here. The celebrations must cost a lot. It??s Christmas today. Christmas It is our important day. Come in. Can I? Of course. Is it okay? Of course. Holy Communion. Amen. I want it too. Holy Communion.-Amen. Holy Communion.-Amen. Holy Communion.-Amen. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Don??t go far. Don??t worry. You can bring these back. No. Other people didn??t have these. I can??t take them. You know I am not a Christian. It??s Ok. You have lots of young kids. Nutrition is important. But we don??t need that much. Save some for others. It??s Ok. No worries. Thank you so much. Grandma, I am so tired. Let??s rest here. Have a rest and then move. I??ll ask Yang to add milk powder into flour. He can make buns. It will taste great. Really? Really. Is it really delicious? Grandma. Of course. I want to eat a lot. Ok. What are they doing? I don??t know. What are you doing? Yes. It??s easier to pull like this. You are so smart. Grandma. Grandma. Sit down. What? You ask me to sit here? It??s ok! Sit here. Ok. Fine. Does this work? Grandma, we will protect you. Ok! Slowly, pull steadily. Go. What is this noise? You are back. How long have you had this? So cute. It??s sleeping. Where did you get all these chicks? Mrs. Lian can teach us how to raise chickens. Hi, Mrs. Liang. Take some buns. Goodbye. Bye, Grandma. Ok, bye. Bye! Grandma, goodbye!-Ok, bye. I have a stomachache. I can??t go to school. I don??t believe you. You just want to skip school. Quick. I won??t believe you. Did you wipe your butt with the writing paper? No. Put your shoes on. Grandma, why are there two left shoes? I can??t go to school. It must be the idiotic Guang Yuan. It??s ok. Put them on first. You can change it at school. Ok, hurry! Two right foots? That kid didn??t feel weird? You forgot your bag! Goodbye!-Goodbye! And buns! Gosh! He forgot this too. Nineteen. Twenty. Twenty! Is it right? Yes. Mistress, this is the money from charcoal briquettes. Lieutenant Feng. Yes. Ithink you should take one more share of the money. The nanny can have an allowance. Don??t worry. Yang still has his share. I will take less. Thank you, Mistress. Mistress, how about buying another iron mold? Good, but I am afraid you??ll be too tired. No, I can wake up early. Ok. Mister is back. Commander, allow me. Commander is here. Mister is back. You are back. Thank god he??s back safely. Thank god we are all safe. Quiet. Airight. Ready? Yes. One, two, three. You moved. I did not move. Yes, you did like this. That didn??t count.-You be the ghost now. Why don??t you sleep more? Did the kids wake you up? It??s time. So many chickens. How many eggs can you get per day? It depends. Eggs are sold by catty. We have 17 or 18 catties per day. It??s not bad. Maybe the price will double next year. Raising chickens needs patience and good care. If chickens catch diseases, it will be awful. When chickens are old, they??re of no use. Tired? It??s Ok. I am used to it. This isn??t necessarily bad. You spent the whole life in battlefields... and didn??t achieve what you set out to do. It??s time to care for this family. Mr. Chiang is ill tempered. Despite all the right things you do... You make one mistake, and you are done. Yang and Feng can??t be with us forever. Feng is interested in the nanny. He has a wife back home. She has a husband. It can??t turn out well. What do we tell their family if we go back? Find a job for him. What? Give me my clothes! Give it to me! What are you doing? You can??t wear this. Don??t you know? Come here! Do you understand? You can??t wear it. Do you understand? Who else? And who else? What did you do? You can??t wear that. Don??t you know? Don??t cry. You should have behaved. You have grown up now. I told you so many times. Ok. Don??t hit him.-I told you so many times. Don??t hit him. You are so naughty. Come here. See. Don??t cry. Come over here, all of you. You shouldn??t have done it. See you??re all punished. Don??t you know you can??t wear these for fun? Especially kids. You can??t touch them. This is a bad omen, a taboo. Understood? Grandma will wear these clothes in the future. By the time, Grandma will look very, very pretty and fly into the sky. I will meet our God. Ok. You will understand sometime. Don??t cry. Go check if the buns are ready? Let??s kowtow to Grandma and wish her a happy Birthday. Happy Birthday, Grandma. Happy Birthday, Grandma. Hope you all live to a hundred years old. Have some peaches. One for each. Ok. Be good. These children are adorable. Mom. We wish you a happy Birthday. May you have great luck and live long! Very good. Thanks. Mom, for your good health. Madame. I want to give you a toast. Happy Birthday. Bottoms up! Excuse me, Commander. Advisor Ma and General Chen are busy today. They couldn??t come. They sent me here. It??s Ok. They are busy. Thank them for me. Yes, yes. And Advisor Ma mentioned the report to me. He??ll send someone to take it few days later. The higher-ups are rushing it. I see. Please take a seat. It??s Ok. I??ll leave soon. I??ll just say happy birthday to Madame. Please. Advisor Tseng Please. Thank you.-Drink a toast to them. Thank you! Thanks! Take a picture. No. Let??s take a picture together later. So we have a group photo later. Okay. Come on. Thank you.

I will give her a ride back. Thank you, Sister Ma. You brought me a lovely cake! Yes, I also have to thank the Lord. God bless you.-God bless you. Take two Birthday peaches with you. Thank you. Please sit down and enjoy yourself. Enjoy it. Are you leaving? Mrs. Liang, please stay. Guang Hui. Guang Jay. Let them eat. It??s fine. You two... walk Sister Ma to the church. Thank you both. Bye Sister Ma. I walk them to the door. Eat! Ok. Thank you. Do you want a cigarette? I don??t want to smoke. I want to say something. Ok. Madame wants to speak. I have so much to say. I hope you drink more and enjoy dinner. And thank you all very much. Mother, you had too much drink. You can??t even talk. No, I didn??t drink at all. You smell like alcohol. Don??t say you didn??t drink. We are taking pictures. Give her some soup. Pictures! Sister in law! Sister in law! Don??t go! You come today and leave today. Have some hot tea. See, you are drunk. I am not drunk! Look, I am singing. Don??t bother her. Do you want an orange? I can bring one. I am singing. Don??t interrupt me. You fan Grandma. You come today and leave today. Grandma, your feet stink! Your feet stink! I can hear something! Yes. Hurry! Bring Grandma here! Who??s playing with the gun? Is anyone hurt? Hide it. The radio! Who??s making a radio? Who started it? Dad, big brother made it. So Grandma can listen to Chinese opera. For whom? For Grandma! For Grandma??s Chinese opera. You are not hurt, are you? Stop playing. Go to bed. I wish he??d go to war again. Shh! Did he not submit his report yet? Why is he writing one now? What happened? Did they not like his report? Mom, I never thought things would be like this. I have made you worried in the past years. This weighs heavy on my heart. You suffered more. It??s a difficult time. I heard that you wouldn??t leave our home. You hid for days. Now we moved to a place so far away. I don??t when I can bring you back. Chin up. Nothing is real. Just take care of your kids. Only a safe and stable life is what??s real. Nanny. What??s wrong, nanny? Sit down. What??s wrong? Sit here. Ok. Don??t be afraid. Wife! These are the pens. Mr. Lin said we can make money from these. Why doesn??t he sell them? We don??t know him well. Why is he so nice? You worry too much. I trust Advisor Ju. I trust the man he introduced too. Who will buy this? These are imported. Advisor Ju is very smart. He said all government and military agencies would use these pens. Also, the president uses this kind of pens. For official documents? How many official documents does it take to finish a pen? Give Advisor Ju a shot. Maybe he can use his connections. Mr. Lin said he will import carbon papers. Did You order it? I ordered four boxes. Order fewer. Let??s see how it goes. Why are you so reckless? You both are married back home. What do we tell the commander now? Talk to the nanny. As for the commander, I will talk to him. It??s too late now. You two pick a date to register... and worry about the future later. Yang, this is for you. What is this? What is it about? What do they say? You??re recommended for a job in Yangmingshan Administrative Bureau. It??s not much, not like the old times. I will double it when we are better off. Open it! Put it on to the bride! Put it on! Lieutenant Feng! The gold bracelet! Put it on... I put it on for her... Thank you! Thank you! No, it??s a your big day. Get up, get up! Today is a happy day. You can??t cry. The commander is here.

Please send my regards to our old colleagues. Thank you. Guang Jay. This is for the groom. Thank you, Commander. This is for the bride! Thank you, sir. Open it. Yang. Open it. I have one too! Commander, I was married back home. I am sorry. You??ve worked hard. You deserve a pair of new shoes. Yes sir. Yang, when you go to the new workplace, you should clean up a little. Yes sir. Drink less, talk less. Commander, don??t worry. When I start my new job, I will keep the kitchen very tidy. Commander, I won??t embarrass you. Very well. Lieutenant Feng, when you are on board, check which court you are assigned to. The law marshals are just like us. Obedience is most valued. Read more when you have time. Law marshals have to take tests. It??s his wedding day. Why are you saying this? Yes, I??m too serious. Everyone drink more! Thank you, Commander. Drink more! The dorm is for single people. She had better stay home first. Come pick her up when you settle. Yang, you sleep in the kitchen tonight. Commander, I already sleep in the kitchen. Ok. Enjoy drinking! Thank you, commander. Thank you. Slow down. Give it to me. Come down slowly. Be Careful. Why did you climb up the ladder? Slowly. Be careful with the baby. Where are the kids? They are out on the parade. Oh dear. Are you all right? May I ask if this is the Wang house? Yes, my dad is inside. How may I help you? The boxes are sent back from the headquarter. And a receipt. Put it here. It??s not bad. At least they sold few boxes. What is it? Nothing. Check! What are you playing? Ok. Stop now. So many pencils! Pencils! Take some. Look. Aren??t they pretty? Here, three for each person. Red and blue pens! Grandma, I want one! You two can??t have them. Only when you??re older. If you run out of them, there are more. But you can??t buy more pencils. We can??t use these to write our homework! No, the teacher won??t be happy about it. Why not? Why aren??t teachers happy? Isn??t this a pen? Can??t you write with it? Grandma, teachers will be angry. They grade our homework in blue and red. We can??t use those colors. No. Why can??tyou? I haven??t seen anyone using it. No. Who says you have to write in black? You are so unreasonable. Why don??t brothers and sisters use these? Yes. They use fountain pens in middle school. Who syas middle school students should use fountain pens? Right. You never do your homework. You spend the money on candies, not pencils. So be quiet. I always buy sweet potatoes. Yui Fei had no money, nor pens or papers. He learned to read and write on sand. Yes, yes, yes. You are picky about pens? So immature. Do you know that... your parents are worrying about these pens? If your teachers really are unhappy, I will talk to them. Come here. What? Are you the new principal? No, the principal just went out. I just cover for him for the moment. Please sit here. Thank you. How can I help you? Just a little thing. You are absolutely right. We encourage the spirit of Yuie Fei. Yet, students?? homework and teachers?? marks... should be different colors. If they are all red, it would be confusing. Does that mean yes? I??ll ask the kids to use blue ones. Can you ask them to sharpen the pencil? Otherwise, it would look like scribble. It??d be easier for teachers this way. Ok. Thank you. I notice you grade papers with red pens. If you need red and blue pencils, let me know and I??ll give you a discount. What do you think? See, writing in blue looks good. Nice. What are you doing, Guang Fu? Why aren??t you doing homework? You are weird these days. Grandma, he??s in love. His girlfriend is Wong Jia Fen. He wrote her love letters with red pens. He??s angry now... because his girlfriend hates him. Ok, shut up. He??s very angry. What??s wrong? Hurry up! Nanny. Bring a chair. Ok! Madame. Madame. Slowly. Sit down slowly. I am calling a rickshaw. Take it easy, madame. Don??t worry, I am fine. I am experienced. Is Ms. Guo??s family here?(Dialect) Is Ms. Guo??s family here?(Dialect) Is Ms. Guo??s family here?(Dialect) Is Ms. Guo??s family here? I am. Is my wife safe? Both the mother and the child are safe. Congratulations, it??s a boy! Thank you. Mom. You are all here Look at the baby. Your brothers and sisters are here. These children are all yours? 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.10. Good job, man. You can look at him without touching. Yes, father. Does he look like your mom? No, he looks like you. He??s like his dad. Guang Chiang, don??t point your gun at people. Take aim at the air like this. Here, put it together. Nanny, the chicken soup is ready. Put some noodles in it. Madame likes it. Yes. And I saved you half a chicken. Thank you, Ma??am. You??re welcome. Have some. Why are the chickens all dead? Dad! Come here.-Our chickens are dead. What happened to our chickens? They are all dead. Quick! Take the medicine. Give every chicken the medicine. Catch them! Don??t mind if they are dead. What??s wrong? Our chickens are dead. What happened? What is happening? Guang Fu, Guang Chi. Help them out! Ok. They escaped! Hurry up! Here, give me some medicine. Here, take it! What are you two doing here? Get out. You are messing around. Guang Hui, Guang Jay, go to school. We adults will take care of it. Don??t worry. Go to school. Come on. Open your mouth and take medicine. Guang Fu, here! Grandma gives you extra five cents. Walk slowly. The road is slippery. It is slippery. Be careful. Be careful. It is slippery. You have had a rough time these days. Sorry, I didn??t take good care of you. Thanks to these poor chicken. We have managed to get by. It??s all right. We can think about something else to do. We shouldn??t be like those veterans... who work as farmers with low income. This house is worth some money. If we fix it up, it??s worth some money. Maybe we can rent it to the US military. Rent it to Americans? Where should we live then? We can move to the quiet countryside. What do you think? The kids are growing. The house is not big enough. We will have to expand it later. It??s better to live in the countryside. In this way, one house for living and one for leasing, our life will be securer. Where do we get the money? I have some jewellery we can sell. If you say yes, I??ll find a land in the countryside. And then ask Mr. Chen for help. Mifune Toshir. Guen Ho, someone is selling persimmon. Do you want some? This. Grandma! How much is it per catty? Very cheap. One dollar. One dollar. How many do you want? Grandma, let??s come back tomorrow. I need to go to the class now! It??s okay. I??ll just get a few quickly. We can come back tomorrow. Tomorrow? Tomorrow. Where are you going? Sorry, we will come back tomorrow. Thank you. Grandma, let??s go. Guang He. Mifune Toshiro didn??t wielded his sword. but the man died, how come? He even smiled at him. Grandma, you missed it. Mifune??s swords are too fast. He jumps up, wields his sword... and thrusts it into Sasaki Kojir??s stomach. The billboard won??t move. You can??t see it. Let??s go home. I have to go to school. I will watch it with you again. It won??t be out in theaters for long. Grandma, someone is following us. It??s strange. Walk faster. Bad people don??t show up in broad daylight. Don??t worry. Maybe he??s going the same way. Ma??am. It??s Fu Shun. I think I am right. I am Fu Shun. I am Fu She, Chou. Do you recognize me? When you were buying movie tickets, I recognized you. I didn??t call you... as I didn??t want to delay you from the movie. Fu Shun. Yes. You really are Fu Shun. Yes, Ma??am. It??s Fu Shun! Fu Shun. Madame. Fu Shun. When did you come to Taiwan? Sit here! How have you been? We??re good. Come inside and sit here! It??s fine. Here is fine. How is the commander? Good. Great. He is healthy. He went to Taipei. Maybe he will be back soon. Don??t go. Have dinner with us. He. Bring some tea and cigarettes. Who is this? This is Ding, the youngest, born in Taiwan. Come, meet brother Fu Shun. Brother Fu Shun. Look at the guest. Brother Fu Shun. What a good boy. Don??t stand there. Have a seat. Please sit down. Ok. Here. Thank you. Bring it to another room. You are skinny. What happened? I have a weak stomach. I got a stomach problem due to poor diet. Do you smoke? I can tell from your yellow teeth. Come on, have a cigarette. The fifth son is not as chubby as he was? He grew taller. What grade are you in? I am in eighth grade now. He??s not as smart as his siblings. He only likes painting. He didn??t get in a good school, so he goes to the night school. Ok. Go to school now. There??s still time. I haven??t seen the kids for a long time. I probably won??t recognize them. They will be back soon. Only Guang Hui doesn??t come back often. She is studying in a teacher??s college. How did you come to Taiwan? I didn??t make it onto the boat. I was pushed away by the crowd. Ma??am I brought your painting here. I will go get it now. Fu Shun. No rush. It??s fine. I live right behind the theater. Five generations in a family. Chi Bei Shi is such a good painter. Yes. It??s not easy to bring this painting. Guang He, look at the strokes. Look how vibrant the painting is. It??s a pity that it??s torn. Guang Jay, Guang Fu. Give me a hand. Commander. I am Fu Shun, Chou. Fu Shun! Yes! Dad. Take it. The commander is back! Fu Shun! Ma??am Are you tired? No. Fu Shun. I give you a toothpaste and a toothbrush. Yes. Brush your teeth. Yes. Maybe you can bring a wife back to China. I brush my teeth from time to time. I have toothbrushes, but I always forget to use them. How come the commander has toads? These aren??t toad but bull frogs imported from the US. I heard they are expensive. All the restaurants want them. The military sent two boxes to us. Does the military raise bull frogs? Don??t be silly. It?? the man from the military... Who is that... The military restaurant gave them to us. Yes. Mister wants the kids to take care of them. Maybe we can sell them for a good price... and pay for their tuition fees. Fu Shun. Take a break. Yes. Have a cigarette. Yes. Fu Shun. What is your tattoo? I haven??t told you the story yet. No. I became the red army back then. I was sent to fight the war against the US. Oh. At the time, I was throwing grenades. We threw a few, but... The American planes were approaching! They fired the machine guns at us. We hid in the bunkers... for three days and two nights. There was nothing to do. Later we were captured by the Americans. They searched my bag... and found your painting. I never figured out... why they didn??t take it. Maybe he thought you painted it. Yes. The he smiled at me and gave me a thumbs up. He gave me the painting back. And then I was at the POW camp. I had to fill out a volunteering form, but I couldn??t read and write. Someone asked where we wanted to go. Some wanted to go back to China. Some wanted to go to Taiwan. A few instructors analyzed things for me. I thought it over. I decided to come to Taiwan. Yes! However, someone messed with me. He suspected I was a communist. I swore over and over, but it didn??t work. We got to show our loyalty by action. So we copied Yui Fei and got tattoos. Tattoos of loyalty. Back then, some people tattooed the national flag or Taiwan. I got the national emblem. Liu, that little bastard. He thought I was too skinny to tattoo. He tattooed only ten rays, not twelve. That time, I was afraid that people would suspect. Intentionally I started afight with Liu... to prove to the officials my loyalty. Fu Shun. What about the scar? I had a stomach sugery by an Indian doctor. He almost cut the tattoo in half. I told you to extend the lease for an extra year. I wanted to lower their rent so they??d stay. Great. Now they don??t want to rent the house. What do we find the money for the deposit? We have to pay the children??s tuition. You could tell the older ones to quit school... and go pull rickshaws with Fu Shun. Or tell them to go to the military school. Is anyone getting off at Wo Long Street? Yes yes! Yes. Is everything all right? Is Father all right? How can you drive a bus? I??m sorry. Sorry. Sorry! Don??t put too much water into the pit. Ok. Don??t talk. Or the bull fogs will all jump out. Jump! Let them jump. Gosh. Bring this to your dad. What a bad luck. Have you finished the translation? Done. Brother, what does ??for rent?? mean? Is this correct? ??For rent?? means renting things out. Dad, this means renting things out. What a terrible brush! Grandma, the frogs are out. Dad, the frogs are out. Hurry! Let??s go! Be careful. I know! There??s a ditch! Ok. Let??s go. Where are they? Find a net to fish them out. Quick! Where? Where? No. There, there. Guang Jie. Here! There is one! Hurry up! Help him! Quick! Commander. All the frogs are gone. Whatever... There are some painting from Chang Shuo Wu. Let??s look at his paintings first. Chang Shuo Wu. This should be the one. This is a fake. Maybe a student imitated his painting. It??s not worth much. Fake? That??s not possible. My father was a painter. He examined these painting before. Yes, but we??ve seen so many paintings. We know if it??s a fake. Although it??s a fake, it??s a good one. No many people can afford paintings though. If we take these to Hong Kong, maybe we can sell one or two. There are real ones and fake ones. We can??t only pick real ones. Right? Right. How about buying them as a whole? How about that? Greetings Ma??am. Ma??am Can I see that painting inside? That one is my mother??s. It??s not for sale. The Red Persimmon by Bei Shi Chi. A famous painting. Mr. Tsang. There are so many paintings, good ones and bad ones. It??s better to evaluate them individually. I have already said that... if you are selling them together, we will think about it. You know at the time like this... these are hard to sell. Guang Hei. Close the trunk. How about this? Ten thousand and three hundred dollars. If you sell the Red Persimmon, I will buy them for fifteen hundred. What do you think, General? The kids have to go to school. Someone is here for the house. Wake up. Someone is here. Tidy it up. Coming. Is your house for rent? Yes. Please come in. Don??t take off the shoes. It is dirty. This can be the living room. This is the living room. Hi, nice to meet you. Hello. This can be the dining room. This is the dining room. I lived in a house like this in Japan. Really? I like Japan. The cherry blossoms are very pretty. The Fuji mountain was very tall. Have you been? No. I wish I did. What were you saying? Oh, it??s big! Do you like it? He??s nice. What else would he like to see? How much is the rent? 120 USD per month. 129 USD per month? Ding. Did you thank the lady for the gum? It??s too much. Too expensive. 120 USD? Houses near Chong Shang north road... are about the same price. How about 80 USD? Don??t worry. I have asked around. I won??t fool you. If you are willing to... pay twice a year and sign a two year contract, I??ll give you a discount. We??re both Chinese. There is the best we can do. Right. The Filipino family this morning... Are they coming again tomorrow? Yes. Yes. Tomorrow. They agreed to pay for six months at once. 120 USD. Ok. However, can you only charge 100 USD? 100 USD? You know, we can do business again, If you want. Tomorrow I will bring the contract. Ok.-Call me if you have anything. Ok.-Think about it. Ok. I know. I understand. Thank you for your help. Can they pay some down payment? Down payment? They want some down payment. No problem. Around 100 dollars. No problem. 100 USD is fine, right? How about the deposit? I won??t let you two down. Call me. Ok? Everything is good? Ok. Can I shake hands with him? He wants to say thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Congratulations! Call me. Ok. Call me! Say goodbye to uncle and aunt! You guys did very well. It??s not a waste for you to learn English. English advertisement was very useful. Do they need to pull rickshaws for money? No. No rickshaws. Don??t eat like a pig. Study English harder. So we won??t be bullied by the translator. He got a ten dollar commission from us. I think you have to study abroad, if you want to be successful. Yes. Painting or playing basketball is of no use. Famous paintings are of little value, even sold at a discount. Famed painters can??t compete with a translator. I am so angry. Ok. Calm down. We are in luck now. I will show you the US bill. Who is that president? Li n Coin. No! Lincoln has a beard. This one doesn??t. The one who chopped off the cherry tree? That??s Washington. Lincoln liberated slaves. Yes. Ok. Anyways, forget about cherry trees or slaves. Have some watermelons. Don??t be afraid. It will be done soon. Almost done. Don??t argue. I am not going. Grandma.-Look, what time it is! I will fix it for you. Ok. Stop badgering me. Grandma. You are too old to hang around me. Look, it??s raining. The rain stopped. Stay at home. Grandma Or ask your mom first. I can??t do anything. Grandma, an old film is playing again. The film stars Guang Bai and Jun Yan. Today is the last day. Tomorrow there will be a new movie. It??s now or never. Yes! What now or never. Will you die if you don??t watch the movie? No, but Fu Shun said it??s good. He says Guang Bai is so hot in it! What? Grandma. Guang Bai is killed in it. Who killed her? Anyways, Guang Bai just got killed. It??s very exciting and thrilling. When??s the next movie? (Give it to me.) (Why did you hit me?) (What do you mean?) (No one would do this but you.) (If someone finds this,) (we would be very embarrassed.) (I am Hong??s wife anyway.) (What??s to be embarrassed for?) (What did you say?) (I am telling you from now on,) (never mention Hong??s name.) Don??t be afraid. It??s fake. (Have you been?) (Yes.) (I??ve done everything as told.) (Have they promised us money? Or the person?) (I told them to respond in ten days.) (If anyone stops you, talk to me.) (Thank you, dad.) (Don??t call me dad.) (I might have to call you mother in law!) (Will you repay my favor?) (Of course.) (You are naughty.) Give me some light here. Be careful, Grandma. Ok. The wind is so strong. Umbrella! The wind is too strong. Guang He, take care of Grandma. Ok!-OK! Be careful, grandma. Grandma, the bridge is very short. Come... Be careful at the back. Quickly! Grandma, careful! Go up first! Wait. Ok. Grandma, are you hurt? Don??t shine the flashlight on my face. I am tricked by you again. Grandma, you tricked yourself. Pick Grandma up. You wanted to take the short cut. Shush. Fine. Pick me up. This medicine again? Everyone takes some. If you are sick, your mom will blame me. Here, give them the water. Amen. Why did you say Amen? So bad! You are... You are having a fever. Grandma, I am older now. Don??t touch me. You needn??t fuss. I am checking if you have loose balls. Are his balls loose? Shut up. Grandma, he mentioned the hot actress again. Grandma. Look at this. Do you like it? You want my honest opinion? The painting is a lot like the real person. It lacks something though. What does it lack? The charm of the person! You didn??t capture the charm. This painting is a waste. A waste? Guang He, if you want to go to art schools, you need to improve yourself a lot. It??s Ok. I can join the army if I fail. The older sister is back! Are You playing? Grandma, are you enjoying the sunlight? What do you think about my painting? You are very good at torturing Grandma. It??s only been a few weeks and you are back. You forgot, I am an intern now. I am actually teaching. I have a friend whose dad owns a watch store, so I bought you a watch on discount. Do you like it? I am too old to care about time. It??s so new. So pretty. Let me help you to put it on. Where did you get the money? I stole it. That was a joke. I earned it by teaching. You can hear something. By the way. Guang Hui, I am giving you this bracelet. It can be your dowery. No, grandma. I still have time. Breaking news. The death of Lieutenant Liu has caused serious conflict between the police and civilians. American embassy was destroyed by crowds, and the American news center was also attacked. When the crowd destroyed the embassy, four rioters were arrested by the police. They were sent to the police station. Two of them are students from xx college. The crowd then turned to the police station, and asked for the four rioters to be released. The police refused. The crowd shouted and set the police cars on fire. Shall we ask Fu Shun to bring the kids back? How could he find them in Taipei? Many were injured. Did Guang He go to school? He left a while ago. Many students gathered, and are having a stand off with the police. The police chief has arrived at the scene... and made an announcement... that the marshal law was enforced immediately. Mom, stop smoking. The doctor said smoking is not good for your windpipes. Why are you like a child? They are not back yet? Grandma, I am hungry. Stop there! You still remember your have home? This is for your mom and grandma. While you were being patriotic and protesting, they??re worried without eating or sleeping. Look at you! You must have followed people, yelling and fooling around. If you are any good, Write something to voice yourself. That??s what really works! Fine. Go inside. Give me your repentance letter tomorrow. Tell your mother that you??re home. Ok. Good that you are back. Go eat and then get some sleep. Leave your dad alone, ok? Don??t go tutoring tonight. Your dad doesn??t want you to go out these days. Okay. Have some food. Grandma. You are back. Good. Eat! Sit down. I saved you some tofu and fish. Eat some. You two really deserved to be punished. You don??t know... how worried your father was. He sat in the yard for the whole night. He didn??t want to tell you. He was so angry that he smacked you. He??s a soldier. Eat. Right. Do you like my watch? Yes. Your sister bought this for me. We??ll keep some money from our tutoring fees. We can go to a restaurant in Taipei... and go to the movies. Okay. When I get better... When I feel more comfortable... We can talk about this later. You eat. I am going to bed. Eat slowly. Hui! Bring some water. I am getting the medicine. The medicine. Mom, we ran out of the medicine. Go get the doctor! Hurry up! I am going with brother. Hurry! What??s wrong with mother? She??s sick. She was fine yesterday! I don??t know. Ask the kids to get the doctor! I already did! Guang He, Guang Yuan Go find the doctor as well! Yes. Forget about your shoes. Go now! Dad, the doctor is here. Doctor! Finally! Please come in.
