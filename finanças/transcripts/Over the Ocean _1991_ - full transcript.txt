Marek Rosenbaum and Ronny Ackerman present: ﻿A Yankul Goldwasser film ﻿OVER THE OCEAN ﻿Arie Muskuna ﻿Daphna Rechter ﻿Moti Giladi ﻿Sinai Peter ﻿Uri Alter as "Haim" ﻿Milly Avital ﻿Oshik Levi ﻿When I was born. 10 years and 8 months ago. ﻿My parents couldn't agree on a name for me ﻿Mom wanted to name me Leib, after her father ﻿who had been murdered in the ghetto. Dad preferred Haim. ﻿after his father. who had been gassed ﻿by the Nazis in Auschwitz. They finally met halfway ﻿and named me Haim Leib. ﻿Dad likes to call me Leibush ﻿1 plead with Dad not to call Leibush ﻿in front of the other kids. But Dad always forgets. ﻿Dad told us that ﻿Grandfather used to own huge stables ﻿in Poland. ﻿He also told us that he was a boxing champion there ﻿In the final match, the antisemitic referee ruled ﻿in favour of the Goy. so that no one could say ﻿they had been beaten by a Jew. ﻿My story starts long before the summer holidays. ﻿During the Passover vacation ﻿TEL-AVIV. 1962 ﻿I don’t like meatloaf -Why do you say that? ﻿Can't you make spicy food, like Gabis mother does? ﻿Gabi's mother doesn't work in the shop all day long. ﻿Children in India don't even dream of such food. ﻿Where is Mirale? -I don't know ﻿Didn’t she tell you? -We haven’t been conversing ﻿in a long time. -Don’t talk like this -How. pray? ﻿-Don’t use that language -Would you be so kind ﻿as to pour me some soda water? ﻿She's with a girlfriend. ﻿I thought you two weren't speaking. ﻿Somebody nearly cracked my skull open ﻿It must be the Rozenberg kid ﻿As long as we don't hear from Income Tax. we re fine. ﻿You criminal! -It was as hard as a rock. ﻿You don't throw food around! -That meatloaf's a week old. ﻿Why are you defending him? ﻿In the camps we ate potato peel ﻿What does that have to do with the child? ﻿Don’t you ever do that again! -Calm down. Rozinka. ﻿Ok. then. Eat up your rice. ﻿How come you closed shop so early? ﻿I got sick of being cooped up -It is our living ﻿After you left, people were just wandering in. ﻿not buying a thing. ﻿Whenever I leave the store you drive the customers away ﻿Well? Is it that bad? ﻿Which reminds me of a hysterical joke... ﻿This Jew returns from his wife's funeral. ﻿At his doorstep, a bird drops you know what on him ﻿Shit. ﻿So he looks up and says... -Sure-Beile... ﻿you got there already? ﻿Morns Greenspan always used to tell that joke. ﻿He's flying in next week Rappaport told me ﻿Rappaport? The one you rescued from the Germans? ﻿Who did you rescue from the Germans this time? ﻿Isn’t it true Dad rescued Morns and Rapppaport? ﻿Who’s there? -Income Tax! Open the door. ﻿Open up! ﻿And you thought it was Income Tax! -Come in ﻿What brings you here? -I popped over for a few days ﻿Once in every five years I get a chance to hold you. ﻿You don't object, do you? -Rosa is a big girl ﻿Weren’t you planning to come next week? ﻿I got hold of cheap tickets. ﻿Dad knew Morns back in Poland. ﻿He rescued Morris from the Gestapo. Or so he says. ﻿Morris emigrated to Canada 10 years ago ﻿Today, he so rich, he can even afford a hotel ﻿When Morris entered Dad suddenly came to life. ﻿and became as merry and frisky as tigger ﻿in Winnie the Pooh ﻿Dad is a restless man. As Mom puts it; ﻿"He can’t sit still on his behind for 2 seconds” ﻿Just look at how your Haim-Leibush has grown ﻿Don't you remember Uncle Morris anymore? Come here ﻿Take a look at the gift I bought you ﻿Don't be shy. ﻿A transistor radio! -Thank Uncle Morris. -Thanks. ﻿I have something for Mirale. too. Where is she? ﻿At school. -With a girlfriend ﻿I'll put them in our room ﻿It doesn't work. -You're so helpless. Menachem. ﻿There you go. That's better. ﻿Take a drag. ﻿How are things in Canada? -Thanks God. ﻿Open the parcel. ﻿Let's drink a toast. -You bet! ﻿So what brings you here? ﻿I have a deal going with Fischel. Rappaport’s cousin. ﻿I've been missing you. -Come on... ﻿I've been longing for you. ﻿I’ve forgotten ail about it. ﻿But I haven’t forgotten. -What haven't you forgotten? ﻿What we've been through The three of us. together ﻿What a pretty dress! ﻿All the best ﻿O God full of mercy Who dwells on high. ﻿Grant proper rest on the wings of the Divine Presence ﻿In the lofty levels of the holy and pure ones who shine ﻿like the firmament, for the soul of Aaron. Arale ﻿Arale? -Who has given his life for ﻿the sake of the holy name the people and the country. ﻿May he repose in peace on his resting place Amen ﻿The late Ahrale. Mom’s and Uncle Leizer's kid brother. ﻿was a paratroops officer and took part in the reprisals. ﻿He was killed behind enemy lines. ﻿and was decorated posthumously ﻿Beautiful job! ﻿I loved Arale the way you love a brother. ﻿During the holocaust he was a just a boy ﻿and already extremely brave He managed to rescue Mom. ﻿his elder sister, from the clutches of the Nazis ﻿My other uncle. Leizer. was a pioneer settler ﻿and emigrated to Israel before the holocaust. ﻿He has not left the country since, not even on holiday. ﻿"I like it here in the Land of Israel" he always says. ﻿Come and visit us again. ﻿Arale promised me that when the time came. ﻿he would recommend that I be accepted by the paratroopers ﻿After he died. Uncle Leizer promised to speak for me. ﻿but I'm not sure he has the right connections. ﻿Me and Gabi, my best friend, plan to cross the border ﻿over to Petra, to see the City of Red Rock ﻿I had my doubts about the trip, but Gabi said ﻿that this would be my only chance of proving myself ﻿worthy of joining the paratroopers ﻿After all we'd been through. Arale and I. ﻿he had to die in Israel of all places. ﻿Why didn't Mirale come to the memorial service? ﻿She’s studying for an exam. ﻿You like it? -It's ace. ﻿My mother will kill me -Why this time? ﻿I missed the memorial service and stayed with you. ﻿I’ll speak to her about it. ﻿Wait a minute! ﻿It sounds like my uncle Leizer's pickup van ﻿It isn't. ﻿You’re dropping combs all over the place. -It's broken ﻿What do you want? -You know very well what I want ﻿Scrub hard. Make it gleam. -I'm scrubbing hard. Dad. ﻿After this, scrub the grill till it gleams. ﻿Look! Your friend is back from the farm ﻿I’ll speak to you later. ﻿There's no arguing with your brother He knows everything ﻿No. You do. -Good for you! ﻿Where are you going? Haimke! ﻿Fuck! My parents Hurry! ﻿Into the closet! Hurry! ﻿The left back Pettalora stands ready. ﻿Goldfarb whizzes swiftly past him and finds himself ﻿facing the huge goalkeeper ﻿Stop it! Are you crazy? ﻿Will you come tonight? ﻿We ll see ﻿Haimke. now you've had it! ﻿Where are you? I’m confiscating your ball ﻿What's the smell? ﻿Where is the little bandit? He’s wrecked the apartment ﻿Hide that ball away once and for all. ﻿Take it easy. Leizer This is not a cowshed. ﻿I’ve had it with this country. ﻿Anybody who has any sense packs up and leaves. ﻿Arale should hear you speak -Stop squabbling. ﻿At least on this day ﻿Very tasty, your meatloaf ﻿Did you read the paper? ﻿The Nazis are designing missiles for the Egyptians. ﻿Are we to sit around and wait for the bombs to fall? ﻿What else? Run away? We’ve known harder times ﻿One more word, and you’re both out on your asses. ﻿Let’s hear what the petit- bourgeois have to say ﻿I have nothing to say?

Don't let her stop. ﻿Oh God! Look at those knockers. ﻿Let me take a look. -There’s nothing to see yet. ﻿Oh God! ﻿What?! ﻿Gotta hand it to your Dad. -Maybe she ordered a taxi. ﻿You'd need a truck to move those knockers, not a taxi. ﻿Where is Menachem? Did you go to the embassy? ﻿He had business to take care of and I had a rendezvouz... ﻿Full house! ﻿Did you get the visas? -No problem. ﻿Everything is being taken care of. ﻿Remember ? ﻿Remember how I used to sing this to you during the war? ﻿Goddammit! ﻿No harm done.

I'll take you for a ride. ﻿Fuck! ﻿Say: "Home!" -Fuck "home"! ﻿Ever seen a gyroscope? -What's that? ﻿An airplane compass. -He's a sharp one. isn't he? ﻿What's it good for. anyway? ﻿For example; say I'm whizzing along. ﻿the police is at my heels and a hill looms up ahead. ﻿The car turns over. I don't know where I am ﻿What do I do? -You check the gyroscope. -No ﻿I draw this -It's just like the gun that was stolen ﻿from my father. -What a coincidence! ﻿I hear you're leaving the country -No way ﻿They're taking a trip. -Shut up. ﻿I know everything.

Leizer. ﻿Next year I’ll send for the whole family. ﻿Go to Toronto. There you can build castles in the air. ﻿Castles in the air? I'm going to be ﻿a major building contractor. -Why don’t you build here? ﻿Do you know what the problem is with this place? ﻿Too many Jews in one place. ﻿Everybody's trying to con everyone else ﻿Times will never get better and peace will never come ﻿I won't stay and listen to this. ﻿Aren't you tired of being Ben-Gurion's cannon fodder? ﻿I won’t be cannon fodder I'll be a paratrooper. ﻿See? -Don't you butt in! ﻿Mr. Leizer.. ﻿In my home Morris can say whatever he likes ﻿The Jews belong here. ﻿In the State of Israel -The State of Israel indeed! ﻿This is just another ghetto, only instead of Yiddish. ﻿we speak Hebrew. -You'll be speaking Yiddish over there. ﻿in Canada. ﻿You said we were taking a trip. ﻿Sure We’ll stay a year or two.
