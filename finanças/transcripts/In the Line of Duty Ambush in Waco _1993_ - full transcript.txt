And what do the churches do about it? Nothing. People sit in their padded pews every Saturday and Sunday, and make pious noises about the return of Christ someday off in the future. Oh, thank you, darling. Now, how are we supposed to respect a church that rejects those with gifts from God to spread His holy word? Tell 'em. - Four years of college, almost two years of graduate school, and then they tell me I'm not needed. - You're not the first good person to be turned away by the so-called ministers. They disfellowshipped me when I was 19, because I prophesied a present truth, and they just didn't wanna hear it. Don't you all love Adrian? (crowd murmuring) - [Girl] Yeah, we love you Adrian. - [Vernon] Bill, how can I ever thank you enough for finding this guy? - Well, you could let us stay here. - (chuckles) Well, Bill, I would if I could, but God's told me that you and Lily need to come and be where you can live the message everyday. Need to gather the faithful around me. - Carol. What do you think? Should your father and I go to Mount Carmel? - Do you have a choice? - I know it's what Vernon wants, but I... - Mother, you sent me to be his wife when I was 17. Do you have so little faith that you wouldn't answer the call yourselves? - You see the Bible tells us that Jesus is going to return to the world. - But before that can happen, the world and all its churches have to be purified, and that's where prophecy comes in. You've heard the Book of Revelation, Ezekiel, Daniel? - Well, I haven't read the Bible much. - Don't worry, most people don't and those that do most don't understand it. You see Jason, a prophet is a man... - Or a woman. - Or a woman sent by God to warn His people to stop worshiping false idols, and accept His word. - Do you believe in the Lord? Do you believe in the message he's given to me? Well, he's given me another one, a special message. A message about you, Libby. - Me? - He's told me to give you my seed. Do you understand what that means? It means that God has chosen you to give Him a grandchild. Psalm 127 says, "Lo, children are an heritage of the Lord, "and the fruit of the womb shall be his reward". Because that's what he needs, lots and lots of grandchildren who will except His message and be purified, and come back to earth and live with you and me in paradise. Will you do that, Libby? Will you help me give the Lord what He wants? - I'll do anything. - To sell everything and move to Waco, Texas. You know, I'd have to leave my job. - Which you hate, almost as much as I hated selling computers. - I know. Do you really believe he's a prophet? - I felt something, didn't you? Look, the church doesn't want us. This is our chance for a ministry in music. It's what we've wanted. What have we got to lose? Can we at least think about it really hard? - Can't sleep? - Ah, my mind's you know. I've been thinking about going with you guys, but. - Maybe think about it this way, what are you leaving behind? Not much. - Not much, yeah. Some family, I guess and... - Mount Carmel, we're a spiritual family held together by the love of God. Jason, I was born a bastard. Never went beyond the ninth grade. Couldn't hardly read until I found the Bible. And then I didn't stop until I memorized it. I saw panoramic views of the scripture, and that's when I understood that I'd been called by the Lord, and in this world is falling apart. It's important to be with people who believe in his word. Look here, you see this? - Yeah, it's slow. It's almost one. - No, no, Jason. It's an hour till midnight till the return of the Lord. Accept His word. Accept His message. Please, come with us and be saved. ♪ Rise up to meet him ♪ ♪ Rise up to greet him ♪ ♪ Rise, rise, rise ♪ ♪ When you are falling ♪ ♪ He will be calling to rise, rise, rise ♪ ♪ Rise up to meet him ♪ ♪ Rise up to greet him ♪ ♪ Rise, rise, rise ♪ ♪ When you are falling ♪ ♪ He will be calling to rise, rise, rise ♪ - [Woman] Hey! - Hey, big boy, come here (lips smack). - Hey, how was your trip? - Oh, it was good. It's good to be back with the family. How you doing? - Meg, oh, I'm so happy to see you. - Welcome to your new home. - And your family. - Oh, thank you. - Did you see any movie stars? - No, but I saw the Hollywood sign. - Hi, welcome. I'm Gloria. - Hi, Gloria, I'm Adrian. - Adrian. - [Adrian] My wife, Michelle. - Hey, welcome. - I want you to meet, this is Adrian, Michelle. - Welcome, I'm Glenn. - How are you doing? - (indistinct) great, yeah, it's beautiful. - There they are, hi! - Hi, welcome to Mount Carmel. - [Man] Can you give them a hand? - Welcome. - [Woman] You're welcome. - Hi, welcome to Mount Carmel. - [Mary] My name's Mary, hi! - Hi. - Hi. - I'm Laura. - [Man] Welcome to Mount Carmel. - Jason. - [Man] Here, let me take that. - [Woman] Just go over. (engine roaring) (tires screeching) (sirens wailing) - [Officer] ATF, get 'em up, get 'em up! Hands in the air! Where I can see 'em, come on! Keep them there! Get out, get up against the truck! Get up against there! - You got a search warrant? - Read it and weep slick. - We've been watching you guys for weeks. - Bring him up. - Oh, lookie what I see here, Where'd you get the machine gun? - I don't know, man. I'm just making a delivery. - You can play hell with your parole, Frankie, but we have to have a little talk about your future and our needs. - I don't know nothing about nothing. - I'll tell you what, you take your time and think about it because I got time. Read him his rights. Get him outta here. - Come on Frankie. You have the right to remaining silent. - My guy says it's his right to bear arms. Look at this. That he is selling drugs for guns or guns for drugs. - Doesn't matter, Danny. It's way too much of this stuff. We gotta get it off the street. Triple, are you telling me you're going to tie our hands? - I am not telling you anything. I am a messenger, remember? - Oh yeah. Well here's a message you can take back to treasury. Our bad guys kill people, including us. - And your idea is not new. You may recall we've tried telephone hotlines to report illegal weapons. - They covered too much territory. - We're talking about a system on a local level. You get an 800 number. They make a call, it rings here and letting people know about it, advertise. - Excuse me, but you know what that costs? - Oh, come on. Bumpers stickers, billboards, community stuff. It's not that expensive. - We've got to let the good people know we're here. Then they'll help us. - You know, Lasson, when these ideas don't work out, it's the special agent in charge that usually loses a few friends in high places. - I'm willing to take that chance. - It's an idea that'll save lives, Dribble, kids lives. - All right, let's go, come on. The pastor's gonna be here. Let me get your books. You're gonna be late. - Adrian, Vernon wants you to take a look at our computers in the chapel. - You bet. - Okay buddy. Let's do it. So there is still lunch. - Okay. Vernon's got a thing for monkey soft bananas. - How about raisins, fresh fruit. - Sorry, dietary rules. Vernon says we have to get used to different conditions. Changing the rules, it's like discipline. But the only things absolutely forbidden are pork and chocolate. You okay? - Yeah, I guess, I just can't figure out what I'm doing here. - Come on. I'll be your tour guide. Now, Glen and Meg, they're kind of the love birds. He's kind of Vernon's second in command. Eating lean's good. Prepares us for the famine. But takes some getting used to. - Famine. - When the apocalypse comes, the four horsemen. Famine, war, pestilence, death. - Watch your step. - The kids all go to school in town. And some people Vernon sends into work. Me too some days. I'm training to be a teacher's aide. So when we have to teach the kids here, I can help out. - All right. - Around there is the shooting range and out there is the exercise field. Oh Lord exercises, (indistinct) is gonna kill me. ♪ I don't know but I can count ♪ ♪ I don't know but I can count ♪ ♪ Babylon will go to hell ♪ - Babylon. - Babylonians, the world. With all this will protect us from, like that part in the middle, we call the tower so we can see what's coming. Before I got here, they even buried a bus which leads to an underground shelter the men are still working on, along with tunnels to connect all the buildings. It gets easier to understand what all the sacrifice is for when you realize that at the end of the world, the only people who will be saved are those who have accepted Vernon's message. - What does saved mean? - After everyone dies, we'll be the only ones who return with him to live in a better world, a new world, sinless paradise. (piano music) - Hey, how do you like it? - It's fabulous. - You wanna try it? - Yeah. - Here we go.

Guard duty your first week. That's what you get from being such a good shot. - Yeah. - Oh, I brought you this. - Thanks. - Is he gonna play all night? - He might, the spirit's on him. Sometimes he preaches 15 hours. - I got a question for you. Does he have more than one wife? - People shouldn't gossip. It's kind of a secret because people on the outside wouldn't understand. - Yeah, no lie. I'm sorry. Look, all this stuff is new to me. I mean, I've only been here a little while and I'm already guarding something. I'm not even sure what. But like you said, takes some getting used to. - Rebecca is his official wife. But in the Lord, he also has Carol and Dory. - And you? - I haven't been called yet. He only gives us his seed when God tells him to, to women who have found the light. At first, I thought it's 'cause I'm not divorced yet. - You're married. - I was. My husband thinks I'm crazy. But most outsiders do. - I don't think so. - Even my parents do. They accepted the message in Vancouver where I'm from. When Vernon called them to the states, they just couldn't bear to leave their comfortable lives. Even though they know Jesus said, you have to give up everything to follow him. - I don't know if I can do that. - I do. I knew at the minute I saw you. You're one of us, just keep telling yourself what Paul said. Faith is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of things not seen. - Sir, ma'am. What's matter, sir? Are you afraid of the truth? - Crack pot. - Now that's just the kind of thing that the children of Israel called Ezekiel. Crack pot, fool. What, do you think that the Bible is just some dusty old dry book telling stories from the past? It is about what is happening right now, today. - You're just gonna stand there, Russ. - He's just talking Charlie. - [Man] Real nice... - Hear the word of the Lord. - Now Vernon. - My prophets are like the foxes in the desert. - Ezekiel 13:3. - 13:4. - You do know your Bible, I'll give you that. Why don't you just gather up your people and go back to Mount Carmel. - Dave, all I'm trying to do is save these people's souls. - I know, but we heard you last year at the conference. I don't think you're going to convince anybody here today. - What, you think there are no living prophets? Repent or I will come onto thee quickly and I will fight against thee with the sword of my mouth. - Vernon please. - We'll be back. - Sure. - All you do is clip on. Get the screw here, a couple of turns and that's it. Go ahead and try it. (rapid gunshots) - Like I said, they're bit good neighbors and all. A little weird maybe, but still those sound like automatic guns and that don't seem right. - No, I know what you're saying, Louis. - Once again, 11 West Lafayette. Everyone got their assignments. - Yeah, but boss, could you tell Elizabeth to stop running on my back? My bunker's heavy. - You gotta move that thing. - All right, folks, I want you to meet Pat Carver from channel three. He and his cameramen will be coming along with us and hopefully spread the word about our telephone hotline program. Pat, I want you guys to stay in a van until we hit the porch. We're gonna be moving pretty fast. I don't want you to get in the way and I don't want you to get hurt. - Gotcha. - They're not gonna blow our cover, are they? - Hey, I don't mind. - Just put this on. - Let's do it. - Yeah. - Yeah, I wanna make sure (indistinct). (suspenseful music) - ATF police, open up. Do it. - Go, go, go. (police yelling) - Way to go, Bob. - Yeah, you're public enemy number one. - Along with the squirt gun, which is legal. This raid by agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that at a half dozen high powered automatic weapons along with $100,000 in cash. - Camera loves you buddy. - Our cameras were there to record the third raid in the New Orleans ATFs new 1800 gun program designed to help law abiding citizens who want to report any information they may have regarding illegal weapons. - Thank you, Pat. Well, Lingling the pen. (officers applauding) - He's good. - All right guys. Calm down. I know you think the TV is just for the public, right? Wrong. It's a game film and it's showing us every little mistake that each one of you made and we're gonna watch it over and over again. - Come on boss, we're great. - And now with TV stars. - Todd, they put your picture on dead or alive. (phone rings) - ATF. - Bob, they're all lighting up. - ATF. - ATF. - This thing just might work. - That's why we gotta get better. - All right. Thank you Jack. - You know Russ, all you had to do was come out there and see for yourself. - Well, I just didn't want you bar feeling harassed. You know, I gotta be careful with your touchy, religious types, ain't that right? - Yeah. Well, I don't know what you've been hearing, but every gun we got out there is legal. And so is this. - What you got there. You got a hellfire? And what do you need one of them things for, Vernon? - Look, we got a right to protect our home and it shall come to be in the final days. - Oh, come on Vernon layoff, will you? I mean, I ain't convertible. Remember my only interest is to keep you from scaring people so they won't think you're dangerous, man. So you and yours can live in peace and you can do your own thing. - That's all we want. - And take this to daddy okay? Come on, sweetie, take it to daddy. Go on, take it to daddy. It's okay. - Matthew, bring it here. - Go sweetie, go. - Did you hear me, son? - He's just a little scared, that's all. - What are you talking about? I'm his father. - Well, I know he just, he hasn't seen you very much. Come on sweetie. - Matthew, get over here. No, by himself. - Come on, honey. - Do you wanna go to bed without supper? - Matthew, honey, please come on. - Then you bring it here. - I'm right here. Come on, sweetie, please. - All right, no supper. No, no, you stay out of it. Matthew. - Vernon, you're scaring the boy. - What, do you think your pity is gonna make him obedient? You think it's gonna save his soul? Hector, we still got rats in the shed? - Yeah Vernon. (suspenseful music) - Kneel. Matthew, kneel. - Vernon, please, he's gonna get bit. - Hold your hands. I am praying for you, Matthew. I am praying that the Lord will give you courage and strength because you are gonna have to be like Daniel and the lions' den if you stand with me and lead the purified into paradise. Do you wanna live in paradise? Well then even if the rats come, you be strong and brave. And never cry out. Can you do that Matthew, for me, for the Lord? Stay on your knees. (suspenseful music) - Do you know what it's like to be tortured like that? To have someone pull off your wings like you're some kind of fly. I don't care who hears me. - Well, I do. - Me too. You know, Jason, the army was your family. They threw you out. You're here now and I want you to stay. We all do. There's a lot of love for you here, Jason. But you were a soldier. You understand the importance of obedience. If we're all just gonna go off and do our own thing, then what's the point of being here. And if we're not obedient in the little things, then when the time of testing comes, we fall apart. Instead of going to live in paradise, we go to hell. You understand? - Yeah. - You know, sometimes I hate the things I have to do. Well, come on, let's go study the word of God. Thou art worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou has created all things. And for that pleasure, they are and were created. Betsy. Betsy, begin Revelations five. - And I saw in his right hand that sat on the throne a book written and on the backside... - A book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. Did you memorize the chapter? - I had homework. - This is your home. This is your work, the work of the Lord. Leave. - I'll pay attention. - Not tonight. You're not ready. You think I enjoy your scorn, your mockery. Vernon's too strict, you say. And you're right, I am strict. Revelation 3:19, "As many as I love, "I rebuke and chase him." Vernon's a hypocrite, you say and why? If I am deceived, why don't you show me where I am an err. Why don't you do that branches? Why don't you show enough Christian love to show me where I am wrong as far as the doctrine. Vernon likes Dory better than me. And you're right, sometimes I do, but don't tell me that because I slept with this person or I used to drink beer or smoke cigarettes. That stuff won't hold over anything in the judgment. And yet you revile me. That's right. Jeremiah 20:10. "I've heard the whispering of many. "Perhaps he will be deceived that we may prevail "against him." But it goes on, "The Lord is with me like a dread champion. "Therefore my persecutors will stumble and not prevail." Now what I need to know is are you ready to live the message? Are you ready to live by the book? Are you gonna bitch and whine because it's too hard to be holy? Who wants to live forever? Who wants to live in paradise? Revelation 2:10, "Be the faithful unto death "and I shall give thee a crown of life." You ready to die for Christ? - I think so. - Are you ready to kill for him? Another weak Christian, all of you weak. Weak and it is killing me to know the price you will pay if you do not follow me. Philippians one, "I am appointed for the defense "of the gospel." Will you follow me? - [Congregation] Yes. - Will you follow me? - [Congregation] Yes. - Lucy, get up, come over here. Lift up your dress. Higher, higher. Go on. Look at her. Now, how many of you lust after her? The truth. Raise your hands. Now, how many do you of the rest of you lust after your wives forgetting that in the paradise to come, you will have a perfect mate made for you out of the rib of your own body as God gave Eve to Adam. Go on, sit down, Lucy. God has spoken to me. He has told me that Vernon Howell is dead. That I am the lamb and that my name is David, descended from the singer of Psalms. David Koresh, which means Cyrus after the king who freed the Jews from Babylon. He told me that all women, not just the unmarried, the married too, all women now belong to the lamb and shall bear the fruit of my seed. I was deeply troubled by his message and I prayed on it and I asked the Lord, why for must I do this? And he gave me a new light. He told me that just as Cyrus freed the Jews from the sins of the world, so must I bear the sins and the distractions of the flesh so that all of you will be free to seek the kingdom of heaven. This way was chosen for me by the Lord. That's right, you're mine. And you and you. And from this moment onward, if you lie with your so-called husbands, know this, it's adultery. Thou shall not commit adultery. Now go on, live in this new life. - Are you sure? - No. Are you? But I don't see any other way. If we're gonna hold together, we've gotta make sacrifices, all of us. Help me. Give me your blessing. It's your love that's giving me the strength. - And God's. - Delivery for David Koresh. (suspenseful music) (people chattering) - I want you to take this guy, funny looking guy. - Well, thank you Jessica, looks just like me. - You're welcome. - Ooh, I got gumbo for the boss. Whoa, what did you put in this? I had some last year, couldn't taste food for a month. - Hey, you talking about a prize winning recipe? - Yeah. - All right. You show us, hot shot. Come on. - No backboard, no real. Out. - Very nice. - Folks. Can I have your attention please? A toast to ATF guns. (audience applauding) Guys, we got the bureaucrats to buy it. And all of you who helped to make it a success, 100 reads and not a scratch. (audience applauding) And for our wives and girlfriends and our kids too for all the crazy hours and worry they put up with. To the new Orleans special response team. Here, here. - [Audience] Here, here. (audience applauding) - Danny, that was Triple. Our 800 number idea is going national. - All right, congratulations. - He just wanted us to know how much the department appreciated our innovative diligence. - That sounds like Triple. What else? - He's faxing us some information on some religious sect in Waco, Texas. - Monday, Bob. - Okay now, close your eyes. Now open. You know what it means? - The house of David? - Not yet, but you're promise to the lamb. Now you just wait for him to call. - Vernon Howell, AKA David Koresh joined the branch Davidians in the early 80s as a handyman. Here he is with Lois Rodin, the preceding prophet and ther son, George. Word is Vernon slept with the old lady, ended up in a fight with George over control of the sect. And here they are in 1987 in exile at a place called Palestine, Texas. Eventually they staged an armed raid to try to get the sect property back, which ended up in a shootout. But Rodin was such a nut case, he made Howell and his people look like one of the mill fundamentalists and they all got off. They even had to give 'em their guns back. Since then, Rodin got sent to jail, Koresh built this place. - So is he a nut too? - Not all the time. We don't know a lot about his recent activities, but we do know he received a shipment of grenade holes. - Hey David, come on, look at this. - I'll take 'em both. - I thought we were looking for musical equipment. - You got a problem, Adrian? - Yeah, I came here to make music, not war. - Yeah. Well, I kind of figured you came here to make love, seen as how a lot of times when you should be practicing, you're too busy committing adultery with your wife. - Come on, David. - She hasn't moved outta your room yet, has she? Has she? - Hi. - Hi. - We're just talking. - Great. See you later. - He's a false prophet. He has to be. - Yeah, but what if he's not? - You're changing your mind. You wanna join the house of David? - No, the thought of him touching me. - I'm sorry. I know you didn't wanna come. - It's okay. Just when I think of actually leaving, I'm scared. If he's the one, we'll burn in hell. - How can he be the one if he's having sex with little girls? (gunshots) - Look, all I'm saying is there's some things going on around here I don't think you know about. - Like what? - Like Vernon and Betsy coming out of his room. I saw her. And it turns out Libby was only 14 the first time and then all the weapons he's got you buying and digging the tunnels and he underground shelters. Jay, something's wrong. - Sure, the end's coming. - You really believe that? - Don't you? - Yeah, I do. But what I don't believe is that Vernon's a prophet. Not anymore. Not with what he's doing. I can't. And since I feel like I'm at least partly responsible for your being here, I wanted to tell you, we're leaving. And I wanna ask you, please not to tell anyone. Not even Laura. You wanna come? - Jason, you shouldn't even be here. - I know, but when am I supposed to talk to you alone? - You're not. All right, listen, no matter what people say, God doesn't care about a girl's age. He sends David to her or her to David when He, God thinks she's ready. - If she's 12 years old, come on Laura. - Since women is Vernon bound by the Babylonian laws. - What are you trying to say? He has the right to have sex with kids. - What are you trying to say? He's a prophet of God. He has a right to do whatever serves God's purpose. - And what if he's a false prophet? Laura, I love you, but it's driving me crazy. - I love you and I'll keep loving you. A pure love with my heart no matter how many babies I bear for the lamb. Please, don't be jealous. - I can't help in it. - It's not David I'll give myself to. It's God and God's future. Jason, I love you, but I don't wanna be selfish. If you have to go, I'll understand. It won't change how I feel. You'll always be here. - They're gone. - They left everything, clothes, books. - Hector said he saw 'em driving away. - The world is dying. It's like some great raging beast and it will try to destroy us too before it dies. And the Babylonians will offer their 30 pieces of silver to the Adrians and the Michelles of this world. People who will lie about me, about us. And they will drag me away and crown me with thorns yelling, crucify him, crucify him. - Jesus had one Judas, David Koresh already has two. Will there be more? Will you be my Judas? Will you? Will you? Will you die in the field of blood? - Mr. Blachet. - That's me. This is Mr. Cole. - How do you do? - Sue Lamas with the children's protective services. The people I called you about are in my office. They've been telling me some very interesting things about Vernon Howard, some of which I thought you should hear. - He's building an arsenal in there, weapons of all kinds. - Could you be more specific? - No, I'm a musician. We didn't have to handle the guns. Look, all I know is you gotta do something soon. If you don't get those people out from under his control, I swear to you, some of 'em are gonna die. - [Children] Chocolate. - Good. So y'all have my number in case anybody wants to talk to me. - Any other recommendations Ms. Lamas. - Running water. Mr. Howell. Better sanitation facilities. - Yeah, well as sure Adrian mentioned, we're working on it. - And is your room still the only one with heat and air conditioning? - Well, yeah, right now. Why, does that count of child abuse? (dramatic music) - They're coming. Can you feel it? From now on we teach the children here. - Of course we'll cooperate with you all we can, but I gotta tell you, Bob, I think you guys gonna have one hell a time building a case against him. - Why's that? - Well, a lot of folks in these parts got guns. You know that. Some of 'em got lots of guns and they're legal last I heard. I know that David or Vernon or whatever he's calling himself these days. He's a strange bird, I understand that. But our local children's service worker couldn't find anything wrong and she tried. Believe you, me, she really, really tried. - What about that girl? One of his dad's claiming she's brainwashed. - Yeah, I know Betsy Lynn. Well, in my opinion, it's just a run of the male custody dispute. I mean, that's the way I see it. - And the grenades? - They're holes, Bob, grenade holes. They're not illegal and those hell fires they got out there. They're not illegal. As far as I know, nothing going on at Mount Carmel. And if there was, I'd be right out there. - I know you would Russ. Look, we're not here to cause you any trouble, but of course he's stashing illegal weapons. It's our job to find out. - Well, like I said, we'll cooperate. - I appreciate that Russ. (dramatic music) - So where's Vernon? - He's busy. He sent me instead. - What is it that you're looking for? - Well, he wants to make a business deal. - He wants to buy wholesale, is what he wants. - You've got a firearm license and we've got cash. He wants to be partners. - Oh yeah. Tell him I'll give him a call. - David. David. Dory said that you were gonna California. - Carol. - Yeah, I am going to California, LA. Check out some musicians, replace the one we lost. You know what, why don't you both come with me. - Carol. Carol, please listen to me. I saw all you girls with your beautiful babies being born for the Lord. I envied you. I wanted to be a part of it. And when David said that if I believed, really believed that God would give me a child. I know part of me thinks it's silly, but another part. Oh, Carol, David's the lamb and the lamb can do anything. Heal, raise the dead, why not give me a baby? Don't hate me. - Mom, I don't, but I've gotta tell you something, I'm leaving here and I'm not coming back. - No, I... - Please, just listen to me. It's not that I don't believe in Vernon and what he says, it's just sharing a man with your mother. It's just not normal. You know what I mean? More and more I've become to realize that I wanna be normal again. Not special or divine or God's soldier, a concubine. Just ordinary. - What about your father and me? - Daddy thinks he's gonna burn in hell. He'll never leave. I'd really like Isaac to have a grandma. - Me too. - Oh, good morning. - More? - Aw. - Man, these chemical salesmen are worse than doctors. - Try shipping orders. Just keep your eyes on the prize, boys. This is how we build the case. - So I hear you claim to be a prophet. - No. I claim you're not the only one God talks to. - Since when does God talk to Judas? - Vernon. - David. - Whatever your name is, you're a false prophet. - Then why are you so nervous? If I'm a man like any other, then what have you got to fear? - Because... - Because of what? - You're out of control. - Oh, how's that? - Libby for one thing and Betsy, that's rape. - You think young girls aren't ready for sex. When I first slept with Libby, it was like hunting her soul. I could feel her little heart beating under my hand. Once she started man, she couldn't get enough. - Okay, that's fine. Whatever, but I'm out. - Why have you betrayed me? Why have you and your whore led the faithful into sin when you know, you know I am the Messiah. Come again. - Are you crazy? - Jesus was pure the first time, Jesus was sinless the first time. But me, I'm impure return to live among the people as a sinner so that when the time comes to judge, I'll know the temptations of man. His lusts, his desires. God wants me to be fair, but how can I be fair if I don't know what you've suffered? Please, Adrian, for your soul's sake, come back. Be one of us again. - So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many and unto them that looked for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation. That's the Bible. Hebrews 9:28. - Who are you to interpret the Bible to me? Who are you to place yourself above the simple Messiah that I am? Hang yourself Judas and hang your whore. I know your deeds, that you have a name and that you are alive, but you are dead. - I thought you'd be gone by now. - Faith is a substance of things hoped for. Isn't that what you said? - But if you're just hoping for me, how can you bear it? - Maybe the fact that I'm still here is the proof of my faith. The evidence of things not seen. If this were just about you, maybe I would be gone, but it's not. Sure, I'm still hoping something might happen between us. God works some mysterious ways, right? There's something else here for me too now. It really is a family. I'm starting to feel like I might belong. - Wanna know what I think, the Davidians are cult and little Vernon Howell from Tyler, Texas has become a megalomaniac who calls himself David Koresh and is gonna save his people from the sinful world, especially people like you and me. And I know he is messing with those kids. - Sexually. - Probably. There've been a number of babies born out there to mothers, some of 'em just girls who refuse to put the father's names on the birth certificate. - Well, that would fit with what we know about Koresh's other wives. - I know he is doing it, I just can't prove it because not only is he messing with their bodies, he's messing with their minds. When they talk to me, they're all smiles. It's like they were saying their catechism. But underneath secrets. I know you need evidence. Best I can do are these. I didn't see any guns. Not much of a photographer. - Home sweet home. Looks dark. - It is. It's like a rabbit warren out there. Howell's always got them building. There are places I probably didn't even see. - Well, thank you very much. If there's anything else you can think of, the local Sheriff's office can put us in touch. - I'd rather contact you directly. There are things I reported to the Sheriff's department about the kids that I heard back from Koresh. - We have to cooperate with local law enforcement or we can't do our job. - I'm just telling you, don't underestimate the man's influence. - Like what? - Member of the Sheriff's department has a niece with the Davidians. Howell can be very charming. And the more he is adored by his followers, the more powerful he becomes. - And the more powerful, the more influence he has. Now, we hear he's saying he's Christ. - I say bury him under a rock. If he comes up in three days, then I'll believe he's Jesus. - Amen. Thank you. - What's going on? - Go get David, go get David. - (indistinct) are you ready to go? Well, it's gonna be all right, don't you worry. - [Man] Who's gonna be judge. - She's my daughter. They have no right. - According to Babylonian law, they do. - She is your wife, aren't you gonna fight for her? - We're not ready. - Will we ever be? - Dory, the signs are all there. The end is coming. Babylon is still strong and remember Revelations, "He shall make war against the lamb "and he shall overcome them." But we mustn't give them any reason to attack before we're ready to defend ourselves. - Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Howell. - We're law abiding citizens, Ms. Lamas, even when faced with an injustice. - You just don't get it, do you? - Look, I know you're anxious, but we do have some constraints. We have to legally establish probable cause before we can justify a search warrant. Now we're moving as fast as we can. - Not fast enough. I've told the sheriffs, the newspapers, you. - The newspapers. - In Waco, they're doing a series on him. - Oh great. - Nobody understands. You're gonna take on a man who believes he's Jesus Christ. - We understand that. - No, you don't. He wants to take you on. See you're the guys that he's been preaching are gonna come and martyr everyone in the final battle. The one he's preparing for. And every day you wait, the more prepared he gets. And the more dangerous. - We need to know everything we can about the layout, the routine, weapons. So when they come to convert you and they will, it's their business. I want you to go along. Now, who's religious? - Well, I'm a recovering Catholic. Does that count? - I was raised Presbyterian, sort of. - God help us. Okay, Louise and Stan, you're our converts. As far as you two guys are concerned, you want nothing to do with them. Now there's the compound. Let's figure out how to get in. (dramatic music) - Morning. - Hi, morning. - Trouble. - Yeah, it's this damn battery. - I'll give you a jump, if you got some cables. - Oh, that'd be great. Yeah, we do. Dale, why don't you go get the cables? - Stan. - Louise. - Hector. I live over there at Mount Carmel. You guys should stop by sometime. Maybe have some dinner. - Great. - Yeah, I'd love to. - Him too. - Yeah, I don't know about him. Somebody told him you were Jesus freaks. - So what are you guys? Baptist, Jews. - Grad students. - Yeah. - I'll pull up. - Great. - Can you really see with that? Is somebody living in that house, down the road? - College students, Glen says they're spies. Where's Dory? - With David. She's depressed. I let her have my place. I'm sorry. Dejavu, remember. - Everything. - If you'd left, I could have dismissed you as weak, as a nonbeliever, but you didn't leave. And when he called tonight, I was glad to have an excuse not to go. To come out here to see you. Which means I'm probably not ready for the house of David, but he wouldn't have called if I'm not. I shouldn't have done that. It wasn't fair. You're relieved. - You're right, I am. - Did you fornicate with her? - No. - Did you fornicate with him? - No. No? No? - It was just a kiss. - Just a kiss, when the enemy is at our gates. Now is the time to choose. Lust or obedience. - Obedience. - Lust or obedience. - Obedience. - Do you wanna live forever? - [Congregation] Yes. - Do you wanna live in paradise? - [Congregation] Yes. - Will you die for me? - [Congregation] Yes. - Will you kill for me? - [Congregation] Yes. - Will you kill for me? - [Congregation] Yes. - Will you kill for me? - Yes David, I would. - Laura, I'd like to see you later in my room. (suspenseful music) - No, sit down. - No. - Sit down. - Adrian told me that David has lots of secrets. - But I promised not to tell. - How come Betsy? - You're gonna kill them. - No, I'm not, no. But I am afraid that they might be hurt because of all the weapons David keeps around. - They're locked up. - But you have seen them, haven't you? - Sure, some. The one David wears, I even held it once. - He let you handle a pistol? - Sure when I... - When Betsy? When he was teaching you how to shoot? How to load it. When Betsy, when did David let you handle a pistol? - It wasn't just me, it was all of us as kids. One day in the chapel when he was telling us about the end, we'd all come back to live in paradise with the lamb after we... - After you die. - He taught us the right way to shoot ourselves, like this. That way we won't miss or get captured or end up vegetables. - Koresh has guys out to gun shows and flea markets all over Texas. - Buying machine gun. - No, mostly handguns, rifles, a few semis, every now and again, some parts. - He must be converting the semis. Neighbors are hearing machine gunfire. - I know. - And it looks like he's had this Jason kid hire a gun dealer as a front. - Tracing the firearms transactions at the shipping records. It seems that in the last 15 months, he spent just about 200,000 on weapons, related equipment and ammunition. - In the gun department, he's bought everything he needs to fully automate semi-automatic weapons. We estimate he's got 100 machine guns. - I assume none of the folks inside have a license for that. - We checked, National Firearms Registration in DC and our own firearms licensing section. Search came up negative. - He's accumulated considerable amounts of potassium nitrate, aluminum powder and magnesium. In the proper proportion, that's an explosive and illegal. Also those grenade holes are easily modified with parts he has. Add black powder, which he's bought 40 pounds over the past year, working grenades. - Plus a 50 caliber anti tank rifle, grenade launchers, silencers, body armor, night vision equipment and radio controlled airplanes to carry explosives. - I'd say that gives us probable cause, Bob. - Agreed. - So all we have to do now is serve the warrant. - What about picking him up at a gun show? - Well, he's not going out like he used to. I think he's feeling the pressure. - Well, it's gonna get worse. Turns out Bob's information was correct. The Waco paper is working on a series. - As if he wasn't paranoid enough. - I'll have a conversation with the editor. For now, I'll mobilize the other teams. - This is the best information we have so far people. What we know is where the weapons are. Here and on the overview, it's here. We also know daily routine. We know when the men are separated from the women and children. Now this is important, not only for their safety, but for yours. There's over 100 people in here. All of the adults have had firearms training and some of the kids have been instructed in suicide techniques. Okay, Steve Willis, you'll lead to Houston and Dallas teams through the front gate, through the front door. And you'll secure to the ground floor. - Sir. - New Orleans, you'll go around to the east wall. You'll go onto the roof and into the weapons room. Jackson, you and your men will secure the trailers where the old ladies are. It won't be so funny folks if they open fire. Myerson, you and Robo. You'll cover us up onto the roof and then you'll get to the warehouse in the kitchen. And you'll get there before anyone, anyone can get to the cyanide. We're gonna protect these people even from themselves. - We appreciate what you've already done delaying this, but it would help us out a lot if you'd hold off on publication a while longer. - If we do, will you guarantee to take action? Well, like I told you before, the only thing I can guarantee is we're investigating. I can't tell you any plans, but whatever we do, we don't want Koresh spooked. - We've talked to him several times. He was gone. - Yeah, but he didn't have his name in the paper yet. We just don't want our men anymore danger than necessary. - We've already held this thing for a month. - What's a few more days? This isn't the Pentagon papers. Okay. Let me put it to you this way. When are you gonna publish? One to two weeks? - Sooner. - One to seven days. - Stands to reason. - Okay. Thank you. - Gotta be Sunday. That's the biggest circulation of the week. - Monday's still okay. Give 'em only one day to get crazier. - All right guys, let's do it. - Ready and (whistle blows) (officers yelling) - Federal agents with a search warrant. Open up. (officers yelling) - Time. (whistle blows) - Listen up. How long? - Minute six. - Too long, Paul. 30 seconds people. 30 seconds. Let's do it again. Move! (indistinct) The way Koresh has this people trained and disciplined. If he was a Marine (indistinct) they'd probably give him a commendation. - If they didn't kick him out for being crazy. - All the guys wanted to do was get under my hood. - Let's see. Well, you can put that on a T-shirt. I'll take two. - Yeah, but do I get three wives? - Nope. You just get one perfect one from right here. - Waco paper just called, they're publishing tomorrow. - Who'd start a series on Saturday? - Give him two days. He'll be jumping. - It's too late to get anything ready for tomorrow morning. Let's go on Sunday after Bible classes. The men will be separated from the women and children. Huh? - Sounds good. - You guys sure you won't stay for the movie? - Ah, sorry, I got a calculus test. - I'd sure like to come back for Bible study though. - Anytime. - What the hell's going on here? Bible study, rock and roll? - War. (gunshots) (indistinct) (men yelling) (suspenseful music) - If the Bible is true, then I am Christ. But so what? What's so great about being Christ. A man nailed to across a man of sorrow, acquainted with grief. You know being Christ ain't nothing. Well, they've twisted my words, mocking me. They're laughing at us, holding us up to ridicule, but they cannot stop the message. It's here. They'll try to kill us, but they cannot hide the light. It is here. I am telling you, Babylonians are coming. (suspenseful music) - Doug Cameron, Deputy Tactical Commander. - Nice to meet you. - This is Retor, Sprague, and Callway, they'll be the forward observers. - Okay, come on in, I'll get you set up. (dramatic music) - We just left the staging area. Any frantic activity? - No, sir. He's ran about the newspaper saying Babylonians are coming for him, talking Bible riddles. Same stuff every day. - Put Cameron on. - Yes, sir. Sir. - Yeah. - What do you see? - No movement. Nothing on the ground, nothing in the window. You have a green light. - That's him. (dramatic music) - Remember, no blind firing. You have to see your target and he or she has to be an immediate threat. (suspenseful music) - Got a man in the front door. - No matter what happens. Say focused, do your own job. - They're here. (suspenseful music) - Federal agents with a search warrant, open up. - Search warrant, open up. (rapid gunfire) - I'm hit, damn it, I'm hit. - (indistinct) get out of here. (explosion) - Damn it, the bastards were waiting for us. (gunshots) - Go, let's go. Hurry. - Now, go to the tower. - Move, get out the way, go. (gunshots) (suspenseful music) - Go, go, go. You guys take that side. - All right. (suspenseful music) (gunshots) Man inside. (explosion) (rapid gunfire) - I'm hit. I'm hit in the leg. (gunfire) - I'm out of ammo, you all right? - Yeah, I'm all right. - Man on the water tank with a gun, moving to the left. - I see him. - Door, door. (gunshots) - I got it. (gunfire continues) - Hey, come on out. Get off the roof. (gunshots) - I've had bad guys. - Danny, where are you, Danny? - Inside on the ground. Direct down the air condition outta a satellite dish. I'm losing blood fast. - All right, hold on, Danny. We'll get there as quick as we can. (gunshots) Right now we're pinned. (groans) (gunfire) - Do you read me? I'm losing a lot of blood. - I'm calling in. We gotta stop this thing. It's Doug Cameron with the ATF. - What you doing here? Go away, leave us alone. - We're here to serve a search warrant. - Get out, just take your people and get off our land. - [Doug] We need to talk. - We don't need to talk. We just want you to get the hell away. - We can work this out, but first we've got to stop shooting. (gunfire) - Jason, Jason, they wanna cease fire. - No they don't, David's right. The enemy's at our gate. Don't worry honey, I never take you for the back... - No. - Get back, get back. (gunshots) - No, no. - We got some men down, we need to get 'em out. - Hold the fire. Come and get 'em. - One's inside. - All right, but no more than four to get in. - I'm negotiating a cease fire. I think we've got something that'll hold. Only take four when you get Danny. - You trust these crazy peggers? - Hell no, but it's all we got. - I'm gonna go get Danny. Cease five, hold your fire. - Cease fire. - Paul, I'm scared. - Honey, so am I. - Medic, get a medic over here. (suspenseful music) All right, Bobby? - Yeah, I'll be alright. - You two. Come with me. - Get me a medic. Hang on. Hang on, buddy. - Guns up. (dramatic music) All right, Danny. All right Danny, we're here How are you doing? Easy, easy. - I'm not dying with my face in this mud. - Get the ladder. - Yeah, I got him. (dramatic music) Up. - Roll it, roll. - Take it easy. - I got him. - Yeah, slide him back. - Take him back up. On the trailer there. - Yeah. That's good. - How you doing Bob? - All right, outstanding. - Shot up pretty bad, but I'll think you'll make it. - Lebleu? - No. - How many others? - I don't know. - That's not good. - You've got no right to be here, but it's prophecy. You've made it come true. The lamb of God knew the end was coming and we've been preparing for this armed conflict for a long time. - That's okay. - Now, how are we gonna resolve this? - You need to walk out and give up. We're not leaving. - No, that won't do. This won't be all over until I'm crucified and dead. But if you can solve the mysteries of Revelations, the mysteries of the seven seals, we'll come out. - You know guys, we could be here for a long time. (dramatic music) - [Narrator] The raid on Mount Carmel was the bloodiest day in the history of the ATF. 15 agents were wounded and four, Steve Willis, 32, Todd McKeehan, 28, Conway Lebleu, 30 and Robert Williams, 26 were killed in the line of duty. On April 19th, 1993 after 51 days of standoff with federal agents, the tragedy of Mount Carmel continued. David Koresh and at least 71 of his followers died by fire as he had willed. The confirmed dead included 17 children. (dramatic music)
