I can't take anymore. A complete waste of time. That's enough, Kate. It's really enough. - Okay girls, let's just stop for a moment. The hangman wants to talk to us. [ominous music] So you don't like this one either, huh? - It's the same old stuff. There's nothing original about it. - Hmm, I know, it's the violin, but it's essential to the sound. - No, it's not the violin. It's the whole song that doesn't make it. There's something missing. I know the difference between a hit and the mundane. - Oh, really? Let's hear it then. - If you knew what it was, we wouldn't be here discussing it. If you ask me, your creativity has fallen on its ass. You keep doing the same stupid things over and over again. - I cannot make million selling records all the time. I just can't! - Yeah, but this one wouldn't sell a thousand, Kate. It's anonymous, boring. I'd rather not even record the thing. - Well I have to record it now, Lavinia. People are already asking for it. - Yeah, but this isn't it honey. Find another song. Something new. Something mind-blowing and sensational. That's what people expect from you. Another hit, not rehashed bullshit. - Oh, my god, I don't know. I can't seem to come up with anything else. I don't know! - Then find someone else that can write a new song for you. Someone that can do what you no longer seem capable of. Or maybe you're all washed up already, finished! - Finished? I'm not finished and I'm gonna show you. - Okay kids, that's it for today. Okay, you finish too, Paul. [ship horn blaring] [ominous music] - Wait here for me, I'll be right back. - Okay- - Mr. Pickett? - [Mr. Pickett] Daniel? Come in, I'm over here. - Hi, Mr. Pickett. Couldn't we have met somewhere a little less out of the way? - No, Daniel, this place is perfect. We have a transaction to make. A very particular one. Did you bring what I asked for on the telephone? - Yes, it's right in here. - Good. Yes, it's, it's light, it's very, very light. It contains only one thing, but it could mean a lot to the person who possesses it. Right, Daniel? Check it, if you like. The combination is 666. On each lock. Go ahead, open it. (Mr. Pickett laughing) (eerie music. See, it's just what you asked for. The original score. With his own personal seal. [bright piano] [Daniel chuckling] [Mr. Pickett chuckling] [bright piano] - This is the song for Kate. Do you like it? - Yeah, sure, that's nice. We should be able to come up with a winner out of that. Right, Kate? - Yeah, I like it a lot. - But where did you find it? - It's a long story. Let's just say that there's an interesting little secret behind it. - What secret? - It's a song written by Nicolo Paganini. I have the original parchment. The real thing. - Do you mean Paganini, the famous Italian violist? - Yeah. - Oh, really? But that means it's well-known. Even though it's public domain, we can't use it. - Hold it, Lavinia. This song was never published before. - Never published? - That's right. Paganini wrote this song 200 years ago for some secret use, some secret sect that held mysterious ceremonies at night. Don't you know about it? - No. - They say he sold his soul to the devil in exchange for fame and wealth. Hey you guys, don't you realize what this means? If Daniel really has the original, we can use the title Paganini Horror. It's gonna be fantastic, sensational. I can see it, people are gonna love the music. No one has ever done anything remotely like it before. Except for Michael Jackson with Thriller and his fantastic video clip. - We could do the same. - Yeah, it's a great publicity idea. We hire Mark Singer, the director. The King of Horror. - Uh, are you serious? - No one else could do justice to it. We'll shoot the video clip in some lonely house. The kind that scares you just to look at it. - I know just the place. La Casa De Sol, The House of the Key of G, where musicians and composers lived many centuries ago. - Yes, I know it. And I know the girl who bought it, Sylvia. She's a reasonable woman, I think. That's it, that's our house, my friends. The house of Kate's video clip of Paganini and ghosts. [ominous music] - Where am I? What am I doing in this house? In this dress? [soaring violin] Who put this dress on me? Where's that music coming from? But this is my music. Paganini. Where's it coming from? [ominous music] - [Paganini] Kate. Come to me, Kate. [door clacking] [door creaking] [ominous music] - Today in this house, a contract has been stipulated between Nicolo Paganini and the devil. Wherein the musician is granted eternal fame in exchange for his soul. Signed, Paganini and Satan. [coffin cracking] [Kate screaming] No! [screaming] [knife thudding into flesh] [Kate screaming] - [Mark] That's it, that's great! Hit her again, harder! Now angle the blade a little more this way, up. Great. - According to the legend, it was right here in this venetian house, that Paganini sealed his agreement with the devil. And then killed his bride Antonia. And used here intestines as strings for the violin that he played from then on. In fact, Paganini's violin had really a unique sound. Maybe because the strings played forever the screams of his poor bride. - It really is a horrible story. - Mm, just one of the many concerning the great Italian violinist. But they're only fairy tales. - Of course, I don't believe any of it either. [Kate screaming] - [Mark] Okay, that's it. That's enough. - Thank, God. I was stifling inside there. - You were fantastic Kate. - Oh, hey thanks, Elena. - You were both great. This scene will knock 'em dead. - You sure the censor won't decided to cut it out? - Well I mean, it's a video clip. It's not one of your horror movies, is it? [group laughing] - Don't worry about it. I know what to do. You and the girls go change, Kate. We shoot the song next. - Okay, girls. Let's go, that's a good idea. - Mark, would you come here - Who do you think you're - a second. - calling a girl? [women laughing] - This is Sylvia, she owns this house. - Hello. - Nice to meet you. Do you know that your last picture kept me awake nights? - Really? - Mm-hmm. - That's my job as a filmmaker. To scare people. [Sylvia laughing] - Then there's my job, to pay and pay and Pa)'- [Mark and Sylvia laughing] [ominous music] [bell ringing] - Go, go, go, go, go all you little demons. Little demons. Little demons. [ominous music] [Mr. Pickett laughing] Little demons. Little demons. Little demons. Yes. Little demons, little demons. Little demons. Little demons. Little demons. Yes, fly away, little demons. So that the real ones can take your place. So that what happened with Paganini will repeat itself this time as well. That the price for fame be extracted by the one to whom it belongs. His majesty's, Satan.

If you don't, Sylvia will charge me a full day's rent for the house, and I'm already way over budget. - [Mark] Hear that, Sylvia? Anyway you can help us out'? - Well maybe we can work something out. How about half a day's rent if you have to work tomorrow, okay? [ominous music] - [Elena] Whoo though, that's hot. - [Elena] There isn't a hell of a lot of air up here either. - [Rita] That's for sure. - [Kate] I can't wait to get this jacket off. - It went fantastically, didn't it? - Mark's a genius. - Yeah, really. - Hey little Rita, get ready now 'cause we're going downstairs. - Okay, I'm almost ready. - That's good. - Bet they're yelling. - The director's waiting for us. - I like the movements he made us do there with the dummies. - Like I say, he's a genius. Talented genius. You ready Elena? - Yeah, I'm ready. Rita, see ya downstairs. - Tell Lavinia not to worry. I'll be right there. - Okay. You got it. I'm gonna love telling Lavinia not to worry. - [Kate] That's like, oh, I don't know, telling a fish not to swim. [Elena laughing] How's that? - It's been used before. - [Kate] Well it expresses the concept. - [Elena] Honest to God, I think that brawd could have hysterics over a tenth of second. - [Kate] Tell me about it. Did you ever here what she pulled that time in Chicago? - [Elena] Hear about it? You gotta be kidding, it was me she pulled it on. - Ah. - And you weren't even there. - [Elena] Oh, my God, I think you're right. [ominous music] [footsteps tapping] [dramatic music] - Hey, Daniel. How come you came back up? - [Paganini] I am not Daniel. [blade clinking] [Rita gasping] And now you will pay. [Rita gasping] And you will pay in the only coin I ever accept. [Rita gasping] [Rita screaming] [blade hacking flesh] [dogs barking] - I don't know, I just don't know. - Lavinia, she's nowhere to be found. She's not in the makeup room. She's not in the dressing room. She's, she's gone, she's disappeared. - That puts in shit, in deep shit. What the hell ever made me accept this deal? Come on, Mark, do something. Come up with an idea. - What idea? - Uh, I'm supposed to tell you considering what I'm paying you? I don't know what idea. Something that will let us finish this video without Rita. If she wants to take off, there's nothing we can do to stop her. Anyway, I'll worry about her tomorrow when I can talk to my lawyers. But in the meantime, we have this video to finish. - We can't finish the video with just the two girls. It's not enough. - So you replace her, Daniel. You play the girl, right? The third girl. - Right, with a wig and lipstick. Look, Lavinia, I love you, but don't talk bullshit, okay? [Sylvia and Elena laughing] - I'm not kidding, Daniel. Better you than nobody. - You know that I'm under contract to another record label. Playing the role of Paganini is one thing. I'm covered by a mask. I'm no more than a mannequin, but to appear in person, Lavinia, forget it. - You said it, Daniel. You said mannequin. - Yeah, well? - Well, mannequins. That's the solution. - Mannequins? - Yes. - What are you talking about Mark? - You sing, Kate, backed up by Elena, in the midst of an entire orchestra. An orchestra of dummies. Mannequins. I saw even more, lots of them. Through there, in one of the other rooms. - You're right, I saw them too. - A whole orchestra of mannequins. - Yes, it'll add a touch of the weird to the video clip. Mannequins backing Kate, enveloped in smoke. You'll let us use them, won't you? - All right, no problem. [Elena and Kate chuckling] - I'll go get 'em. You guys rehearse in the meantime. - Sure. - Whoa. - Well, that was a close call. - [Elena] I told the world you were a genius before, this time I'll scream it! - [Kate] Amen. - [Lavinia] Now, is there a handy place nearby where I can faint? [group laughing] [ominous music] - [Rita] Daniel? Don't you recognize me? - Hey, Rita? Is that you? Why are you dressed like that? Rita? Rita? Rita? Rita? Rita? Rita? Come on, where are you? Uh. [electronic pulsing] [footsteps tapping] [Daniel screaming] - [Mark] Rita, Daniel? Where are you? [dog barking] - Daniel? Rita? ' [Mark] Rita? - Where are you? ' [Elena] Rita? Daniel? Where the hell are you guys? - [Mark] Daniel? - [Elena] Well this is just a waste of time. They're not out here. - Yeah, you're right. - [Elena] Let's go back inside. It's freezing out here. - [Kate] I'm really worried. Where can they be? - [Elena] I don't know where they are, but I do know that we'll find 'em. Let's just give one more yell, okay? - [Mark] Yeah, sure. It can't hurt. Daniel? ' [Elena] Rita? Oh, let's just forget it, come on. - I would have never expected these pranks from Daniel. - I just don't understand it. He's so, I don't know, he's so predictable. - Oh, there's Lavinia. - [Lavinia] Well, any news? - Not a sign of them. - Nothing. - Are you positive? - We've looked everywhere for them. - What about you? - No, I've checked everywhere. There's nobody. - They've just gotta be around here somewhere. - They're a couple of jerks. - You know what I think? I think the two of them took off together. Daniel's been on Rita's track for a while now. - Oh, come on, that's ridiculous. - Well at least it's a theory. It's more than you've come up with. - Lavinia, all of you, come here. I have to show you something. Quickly. - What is it? - What happened? - I was looking for them, and I found, hurry. It's in here. - What a strange light. - It's coming from over there. - [Lavinia] It's more than strange, it's weird. - Yes, I can't explain it. Anyway, let me show what I discovered in this strange room. Look, can you see? It's in a human shape. Daniel, it's still warm. And this, this is ring he wore. Do you recognize it? - I get it, Daniel's playing a joke on us. Right, Kate? - Yes, he would do something like that. Wouldn't he? - Right, a man doesn't turn into a pile of ashes in a matter of minutes. Not even if the devil himself suddenly popped out, out of the ground. [Kate screaming] [floor crumbling] - Look out, the place is falling apart! The floor must be rotten, hurry! Help her, we've gotta do something for Kate! Help her, Mark! [dramatic music] - Hold onto my hand. Hold tight! I'll try to reach her. Kate? Where are you? Kate? No, I don't see her. - [Kate] I'm here, Mark! _ we got her! Kate! [electricity Zapping] [Mark screaming] Oh, my God! [Sylvia whimpering] My hand! [screaming] My hand! [electronic whirring] [group screaming] ' [Emna] I'm gonna go crazy! [electronic whirring] [group screaming] [Sylvia gasping] - Oh, God! [Lavinia gasping] I can't take it! - If we stay here, we'll die! You guys, let's get out, let's get outta here! We gotta see if we can still find Kate. - We're not leaving here without Kate. - Get off! [Mark gasping] [car door closing] - [Lavinia] They're getting away. We gotta stop them! [car engine revving] [electricity zapping] [car exploding] Get away from the car! - [Elena] Oh, Mark, Mark! Wait, Mark. - It's too late, Elana! - Mark, oh, Mark! - Stop it, Elena! - He's dead. - Mark, Mark! Oh. [crying] [fire roaring] Mark. [Sylvia crying] - What happened? What caused the crash? - I, I don't know. Well, there was a wall. An invisible wall. - A wall? Are you crazy? - It blocked the only way out. It blocked us out. " [Kate] Help me, help! - It's coming from the house. - It's Kate. - Yes, hurry. - My God, you're right. - We've got to help her. - [Elena] Come on, come on! [Kate screaming] - It came from there. [Kate screaming] [Elena gasping] Oh, God. - [Sylvia] Now it sounds like it's coming from the end of the corridor down there. - [Elena] That's the room where the floor fell through. - [Sylvia] Only the light's changed. It seems more normal now. - [Lavinia] Let's go see. Quiet. It's empty. Be careful. Kate? Kate? Oh, it's too dark, I can't see a thing. I'm going to look for a flashlight. - [Sylvia] In the kitchen. - Sylvia, too many strange things have happened. Too many things that go beyond logic. - I know. - But haven't they happened in the past? - No, absolutely not, never. But you know, this house has always had the reputation of being haunted. Only now I'm afraid - Haunted? - That something truly evil has happened. Something monstrous to spark things off like that in my house. [Sylvia and Elena gasping] - Just me. [water dripping] It's just earth and nothing else. No trace of that strange light. Wait, wait, I see something. It's a kind of tunnel. Kate must have gone in there. I'm going down there to check it out. - Are you crazy? You can't go down there, it's dangerous. - I don't care. There's no point in just standing around waiting. You two stay here and don't move. If anything happens, believe me, I'll let you know. - Lavinia, be careful. - Yeah. [water dripping] The tunnel curves out of sight at a certain point. I'll go see. - Please, Lavinia, stay here. - I'll be all right. [ominous music] I'm going on. - Be careful, Lavinia. [water dripping] - Kate? Kate? [screaming] [dramatic music] - But the scream came from upstairs, not from the hole. - You stay here. Don't move. I'll go up and see. [ominous music] - [Elena] No, what is it? [water dripping] - Kate? [ominous music] - Kate? [dogs barking] [eerie violin] Kate? Kate? Are you here? Kate? Where are you? Kate? Daniel. Daniel! [dramatic music] Daniel, wait for me! Daniel. Daniel? Daniel? [dog barking] Daniel? [Kate groaning] [Kate groaning] Kate, Kate. - Who are you? - Sylvia, I'm Sylvia. - Sylvia, oh. Oh, God, my head, Sylvia. I'm so confused. - What happened to you? What happened? - I don't know. I was walking and all of a sudden, I fell into this damn hole. Then I found myself here. Where are we? - In the pool by my house. - Your house? Sylvia, this house is haunted. Please, we've gotta get away from it, quickly. It's got a terrible secret. We've gotta go. - Yes, you're right. We have to at least try. - Quickly, quickly, help me! Let's get out of here. - Yes, of course. [Kate groaning] Let's go find the others. [electronic pulsing] [Lavinia groaning] [sighing] - What? This is the room I started out from. Oh, I know that damn tunnel didn't tunnel back. I know it. Elena, Sylvia? Elena, Sylvia? Where are you? [dog barking] Elena, Sylvia? Where are you? [ominous music] [footsteps tapping] What's happening in this place? What's happening? - Lavinia. - [gasping] Oh, Kate. Oh, you're alive. - Yes, I don't know, but I am. - And Elena, what's doing with her? - Isn't she by the hole? - No, she isn't there. - That's impossible, she must be there. - No, listen, if you don't believe me, just go take a look for your own self. She's disappeared. There's something maddening in this house. Something monstrous. Time and space have their own rules here. [Kate screaming] [Lavinia screaming] - Look over there. [Sylvia yelping] [Kate gasping] - What is it? - It looks like blood mixed with something else. Oh, it's disgusting. - Let see where it leads. Careful, though. - Yeah, all right. - Mm. [Creepy music] - Hey, it's that way. Toward the makeup room. - It looks as if someone had a very, very hard time dragging themself along here. - Yeah. - Let's take a look. [Elena groaning] Do you hear that? It sounds like breathing or like gasping or suffocating or a wild animal. - It's like, it sounds weird. [Elena groaning] [woman screaming] [Elena groaning] Elena! No! No! [Elena groaning] Elena! Oh, God. No! Elena! Oh, no! Oh! - Elena's dead. - But how? Who could have got her to look like this? I, I don't understand. - I think I know. This, this mold, I've seen it before. - Where? - It's a special fungus that they discovered in the 18th century on logs that were floated along certain European rivers. Wood that was used to make the most precious violins. Guarneri's, Stradivari's. - Yeah, you're right. I've heard of this special wood before, and its special sounding violins, but, oh-- - What does it have to do with what killed Elena? - I don't know. I honest to God don't know. But this is the fungus for sure. I saw it enlarged in a TV documentary. - Listen, a wood fungus can't attack a person just like that in a matter of minutes. When I left her, she was all right. - Well this house was normal when we first arrived. Just the day before yesterday. Now there's some terrible curse that's out to kill us, one by one. And all this, all this comes from the music. From the violin. - And from Paganini too. - Right. But how can we stop a monster that isn't even part of this world? [Sylvia gasping] - I know how. - [Sylvia] What? What did you say Kate? - Yeah, it sounds like a crazy idea, but everything's really strange and crazy tonight, so what the hell? You see, we have to fight the monster with his own tools. Because he came into this house with Daniel's music, so the only way we have to send him to hell is to use it as our own weapon. - I don't know. What do you say? - I don't know. It could be possible if it's really the music that's the key. - I'm convinced. There's some secret behind all this. Something that winds it all up. It's something like a mathematical problem. A formula which binds the monster to our world. It's really strange. - But mathematics, it's just like music. Music is five lines and seven circles, the notes, and with those elements, you can get all music. From Bach to Paganini to your songs, Kate. And do you know what? The old scientists thought that the universe was founded on a musical structure, which they called the Harmony of the Spheres. And now, the new scientists, through their enormous radio telescopes, have discovered that the old theories were right. Stars, in their revolutions, make really their own sounds, which are incredible music. - But I still say there must be another reason. Something specific. All this can't have happened just because someone sold Daniel a score of cursed music. - Oh, but you don't think he sold his soul to the devil, do you? - No, because Daniel was killed. - There must be a hidden secret in here. - And we'll find out playing our music. - But how? We're in a complete blackout. - Lavinia, you're forgetting that we have a violin. - Oh. - Let's go. Where's my violin? I don't see it. - [Lavinia] On the floor, behind the drums. - Yeah, there. - Oh, and the bow? - [Lavinia] Here, I've got it. - I'll play the melody now. - Yeah, Sylvia, cross your fingers. - Evil spirit, leave us, go away! Go to hell! One, two, one, two, three. [eerie violin] [ominous music] Now we'll see what happens. - Nothing's happened. Things are just the same as before. - It seems so. But we have to go and check it out. - Yeah, we'll have to go out and take a look, and see if the invisible barrier has disappeared. If it has, the nightmare is over, and Paganini has gone to Hell. - Let's go have a look. - Yeah, let's go. [dogs barking] What do you think? - It feels normal to me, but the only way we can be sure is to go and see what's with the car. - That's for sure. Is the barrier still there? - Who knows? It could be that playing that music did the trick. Maybe you were right, Kate. - [Kate] I hope so. - [Lavinia] Let's go. [dogs barking] - [Sylvia] Oh. - Oh. - That's Mark, Kate. - This is the point. This is where the terrible crash happened. - If it's gone, we're all free. ' [gasping] It's free! The barrier, it's free! Lavinia, it's free. [electricity Zapping] [Kate screaming] [Lavinia screaming] - Stop it, stop, stop, stop it, Kate! Oh, no, no, it's all right. - Why, why can't we leave this place? Why are you doing this to us? That is completely senseless. [Kate sobbing] What is it? [crying] [ominous music] - I still think the music is the key to the problem. What is it that's going wrong? Is it the way we're doing the music? Dammit. Of course, of course. Why didn't I think of it before? What a jerk. - What? - All right, when we have the gate open, the music is played normally, so to close the gate, we just have to play the music to the contrary. - You mean play it backwards? - Exactly. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Oh, why didn't I think of this before? - What, I don't understand? - Lavinia, you get it? Would you listen? It's the only way we have to get Paganini and his fucking music out of here. - What do you mean it's the music? - Yes, I heard, Lavinia. Out of this fucking nightmarish place here. - What are we waiting for? Come on. - Let's get out of here! ' Go! ' Yes! Hurry, hurry, get the violin. - There it is. - Can you play the music backwards? - I can try. - You've got to do it. - Get the parchment, quick. - Hurry. [violin tuning] - Have you got it? - Hurry. - Yeah, here. Like this. - Backwards, backwards. Okay. [electricity zapping] [Kate yelping] [wind howling] Lavinia! - Oh, no! [fire roaring] [Lavinia screaming] - Be careful. - No! [dramatic music] - No! - Oh, my hand! [bones cracking] - Lavinia, no! [Sylvia screaming] [Lavinia screaming] [bones cracking] - No! [bones cracking] [Sylvia screaming] [Kate screaming] [Lavinia exploding] [blood spurting] [violin thudding against head] [dramatic music] [Sylvia gasping] - Don't you move, you bastard! [blade clinking] Bastard! Stay there. Don't move, you bastard! Stay there! [screaming] [dogs barking] [latches clacking] [soaring violin] [Kate gasping] [hand pounding on case] [Kate screaming] [fire roaring] - Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Oh, I'm burning! Oh, burning! [screaming] I'm burning! You bastard! [clock chiming] [ominous music] [dramatic music] [Paganini groaning] [wind howling] [fire roaring] [Kate coughing] [violin banging on floor] [Kate coughing] [car engine whirring] [ominous music] ' Sylvia? 'Hmm? - You? [dogs barking] I thought you were dead? - Uh-hmm. - But, what happened? I don't-- - Understand? It's not difficult, dear. You didn't play the music backwards, did you? - No. - So everything goes round and round in a circle, and the circle holds you prisoner. - Hello, Kate. We meet at last. - Who are you? - Daniel knew me as Mr. Pickett. - Pickett? - Perhaps I don't have a name, or perhaps I have a thousand names. Do you understand? - What are you doing here? - Let's say I'm the organizer of Sylvia Hackett's own private hell. - Mm. - Own private hell? Sylvia, what is he talking about? - Oh, it's all very simple, Kate. Many years ago, in this house, I killed my mother [soaring violin] By throwing a hairdryer into the tub while she was taking a bath. The night you just lived was the night he punished me for my horrible crime. I have been condemned to relive this experience for all eternity, with all new people to punish and play the other parts. - You mean, that this place is Hell? - The people who come here have already been condemned. - Oh. - Ah, the new tenants. They can't see us. They're living in another time layer. And so it all starts over again. Good looking family, aren't they? And considered to be highly respectable. Actually, the only innocent in that nest of vipers is the little girl. We might consider sparing her. - You mean, you kill the people who come in this house for punishment? And I'm not dead, I'm alive. So I'm not being punished. That means I'm safe. I can go. - Apart from one little thing, which I'm sure you've forgotten. You see, Kate, I don't like people who sell their souls [ominous music] For money and success. [flesh squelching] [Kate gasping] Goodbye, little sinner. [eerie violin] I must get back to work. Go on, Sylvia, talk to them. Don't play hard to get. - Hi, sorry to be late. I'm the owner of the house. Please call me Sylvia. This place has a very strange name. They call it The House of G, from the musical note G. Paganini lived here once, and he had some pretty strange ideas, they say. Anyway, I know you're just going to love living here. You're just the right types to enjoy a place like this. I know this house will be an enchantment for you. A real enchantment.
