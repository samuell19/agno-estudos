Come on, Marcel. I left this. What is it? For Lili. That's kind. What's this stuff? My flea market finds. Your father... We said we'd travel light. Go, Ferdinand! Summer holidays are here! THE TIME OF SECRETS First one there! - I win. - Cheat! Marcel, Paul! Fetch your sister. It's the winter damp. I'll fix it tomorrow. You seem pleased. You've no idea. What's wrong? He always waits for me. It's lunchtime. Marcel! Hi, Marcel. I'm writing to say I can't wait for you like usual. I'm helping my father in the fields. We'll set our traps as soon as I'm free. Yours, Lili. See, no need to worry. Look, Dad. You'd give him a zero. Don't make fun. Shameful. Not everyone can attend school. Despite the mistakes, you know where he is. Birds don't care about spelling anyway. Can I come? No, you're too tiny. Jules and Rose arrive later. You told me! Lili! Marcel! Come on! Hi, Marcel! Lili! What do you say? I'm happy. What about you? I'm happy too. What does Marcel say? That I'm happy. Yes, he's happy. Make yourself useful then. Three will ease the work. Let's go. Got my note? You write badly. I did my best. Climb on. Let's hurry. Lovely. You knew I liked these. We're friends. It's a kind thought. Here, boys. Look, Mum. Holy Mary! May I? They're for you all. I love them. I was eager to see you. I was too. Coming, Marcel? You saw? Dad wants me to help nearly every day. So you won't waste your summer, you can set the traps alone. I'll join you when I can. I'd rather help you than be alone. I thought so, but I'm glad to hear you say it. Flying ants are ideal to lure birds. They see the wings shimmer from high up. So they come down to eat and... The trap snaps shut. Try it. A real city-dweller. I'm out of practice. Let's set some more. You'll remember. - Know what I'd like? - No. To live in the hills like you. You, in the hills? I could be a hermit. A hermit? Alone all day in a hut. - Doing what? - Thinking. The villagers feed you and, as a thinker, you pay with wise words. You have some odd ideas! I'll be the Hermit of the Hills. More like the Buffoon of the Hills! Look! - New birds. - What are they? They're like thrushes or larks, but aren't. Where will they nest? No idea. We'll need to watch them for days. Or maybe... He's called Flutterby Ed. He's mad about butterflies. Or the Keeper of the Hills. He knows all their secrets. Why do that? He hates being disturbed, so there are rules. Maybe he's out. He's in. Here goes... Hey, Ed! It's Lili. Who else imitates a partridge that badly? He's happy to see us. Shrikes, your birds are. They're rare here. You'll need to set your traps over there, near the Taoumé ridge. Careful... Be stealthy. Those birds are magical, almost wizards. They hear a shot before it's fired. Any danger, they hop it and head south. We'll camp in the Taoumé cave. Wretch! Never go in there! It's the beast's lair! Old Félix, the shepherd, came back as a snake. Ask Pétugue! Poor Pétugue... One day, he sheltered from a storm in the cave. Just then, he heard a voice... "Pétugue..." "Pétugue..." "Is that you, Félix?" Pétugue asked. All of a sudden, he saw two yellow eyes in the dark and, with a foul hiss, a huge beast appeared, twice his size! It tried to devour him. By Mary's grace, he managed to flee. Now, he's lost his mind, poor fellow. He says the beast has cursed the village. If we keep bothering it, it'll come at night to devour men, women and even children. So, I tell you... Never enter the Taoumé cave. Understand? Never! Thief! Look, Mum. Beautiful! He stole my horse! He wanted to play with you. Go outside now. Thanks, Magali. Pierre has grown! That's true, and as stubborn as his father. You're beautiful, sister. - I put on weight. - Lovely. Here we are! - Sparkling wine! - From home. So, Marcel has a scholarship. Second in the exam. Well, his father is a teacher. That could be a handicap. He's off to middle school now. Let's celebrate! It'll be odd, not seeing him in your class. He won't repeat the year just for me. His scholarship provides free schooling, his midday meals and textbooks on loan. Marcel, you're indebted to France. - Be worthy. - He will be. - Not for me. - I forgot. Heathen, a killjoy and teetotal! - Every quality! - That's not all. Here's to Marcel. To you, Marcel! Above all, don't forget catechism. Am I deaf? I spoke to my nephew. The Scriptures never hurt anyone. Except public education. - It manages fine on its own. - What? - Don't start! - Not on our first day. You've brought enough for a siege. He hates to go short. What have you made, Jules? Hold on. Let the chef work. All right. "Let the chef work!" I know! Provençal beef stew. What? Provençal? Catalan beef stew. My poor grandma's recipe. - You never knew her. - Precisely. Poor woman. Come on, say good night. Good night! Good night, children. It's good to be together. Any news of Fifi? No. Not really. My dear sister must be busy training her "women citizens". Heavens, women's rights! I bet she'll come to nag you. She's determined. Fifi is brave. Few women run schools. Well said. Right, Dad? Wait! Let me say grace. Bless us, Lord, bless this meal and those who made it. Fill our hearts with the joy of sharing. Amen. Saying grace won't kill a pagan. Ridicule neither, so I hear. No heaven for you. Too bad. Heaven? I have it right here before me. The view may be the same in heaven. But you don't need to die to enjoy mine. - So, the stew... - Catalan-style. All right. To your grandma. Poor woman. Delicious. - She cooks well. - Who? - Your grandma. - Poor woman. Want to hunt the ghost? Seriously? Imagine killing Pétugue's snake. We'd be in the paper. In the paper! Maybe they'd even put up a statue to us. Why not? But hunting ghosts creates a din. You heard Ed. The birds will clear off. Maybe you're right. Game first, then the ghost. That's it. Game first, then the ghost. But we're not scared. No, it's just... logic. Exactly, logic. You know, I like logic. I like it too. Just think, Marcel. Thank you, Ed! He won't hear from here. Thank you, Ed! The echo lasts longer this way. Come on. Thank you, Ed! Look... The Taoumé cave. Hey, Félix! We're here! You're barmy! Totally barmy! Beautiful. I told you so. How did you know? Ed said where to look. He knows these hills. - Mum will be pleased. - You bet. Some rosemary now? Oh, Lord. - What? - I know her. She and her mother came to buy eggs. She's so stuck-up... Wait. What? She looks lost. My foot. She just wants attention. Hello. Which way to Les Bellons? You lost? I've strayed from my path. It's no reason to be familiar. Well then... Les Bellons... Take the path to the fork, then turn right. Thank you kindly. Thank you kindly! Totally stuck-up. She lives at Les Bellons? Let her manage. Come quick! I don't believe it... A tarantula. Highly venomous. Step back slowly. Nothing to fear. So you say. A gallant boy doesn't leave a young lady in such danger! 4 o'clock at your place. Good luck! I have to take my mother thyme for lunch. For helping me, you may be less formal. A few times. So you're Marcel? - Yes. - It's not bad. Isabelle is prettier, but it's not your fault. You're Isabelle? Isabelle de Montmajour. You're nobles? My father, Loïs de Montmajour, is a famous poet in Paris. But I suppose you've never read a poem. Of course I have. Rare for a peasant. I'm no peasant. My father teaches at Chartreux, Marseille's biggest school. He's not a teacher, but a schoolmaster. Not as good as a teacher. - Do you like grapes? - Not stolen ones. They're better. You'll be less proud in jail, with your name in the paper. My father works for a paper called Le Petit Marseillais. - Is he the editor? - Much more. He corrects the others' articles. You may be more familiar as we walk. Why not make the most of it? It's too late now. Admit I impress you. Me? Certainly not! It's true. My beauty intimidates you. Like all the boys. I make them blush when I want. Give me grapes. But you said... Now, I want some. Gently! One by one. Delicious. Another. Enough! Don't overdo it. There's a house here? Few people know. We cherish our privacy. There you are, Babette! Coming, Mother! I thought a wolf had eaten you. Mother, it was a close call. Very close. This is Marcel, the one who saved me. His hands are dirty, but he's very brave. With his stick, he chased off at least ten snakes. His hands are very dirty. But you shouldn't point that out. - I was picking thyme for my mother. - Yes, for his mother. Welcome to our home. Babette, fetch grenadine cordial, crystal glasses and straws, from the living room. Come and help, Marcel. I'll show you our living room. Your livigroob? Come on! What are you doing? Is this the livigroob? Of course. Haven't you ever seen one? - I have, but... - What? I'm pleased you like our home. It's true, it's all so beautiful. We like pretty things. And your home? What's it like? It's... different. You may return to play but... Oh, yes, Mother! May he come this afternoon? Please. If his hands are clean and he speaks nicely. Come on, sweetheart, time for your nap. See you later. Bye-bye, Germaine. Lovely, but I managed without. - What's wrong? - I found a girl on a rock. What? - Dead? - No, lost. Even more dangerous then! She was scared of bugs. I had to take her home or she'd have died right there. You saved her. Maybe. She lives at Les Bellons. In a château. - A château? - At Les Bellons? It's beautiful. Like in a tale. Is she as beautiful? I don't know. She's twelve... It's odd, she calls her mother "Madam". - She can't be her mother. - She can't be! She is. And her mother calls her "Miss". What else? Her father's at Le Petit Marseillais. - The paper? - Yes. He even corrects others' mistakes. The printers' mistakes, not the writers'. And he's a poet, well-known in Paris. In his neighbourhood, at meal times! It could be true. Hold on a second. What's his name? Loïs de Montmajour. - Montmajour? - Sorry? Loïs de Montmajour. - He's a noble. - Nobles? At Les Bellons? It's obvious, with that château. Know what a "livigroob" is? - A "livigroob"? - What? It's not Provençal. Turkish? Maybe a sort of strange grub! Like a lounge, only bigger. A "living room". English. It's English. Exactly! Dad, you love furniture. Theirs is from around the world. Local furniture suits me. You haven't eaten. Want something? No, I'm not hungry. I have to go. Perhaps he has a crush... Are you seeing her again? Maybe, if I have time. I have so much to do with Lili. A crush, I tell you. I thought you'd forgotten me. You play the piano? You ask stupid questions. - I never saw one played. - So sit. - There? - Yes. Do you know who owned that sofa? No. Pauline Bonaparte, in person. You look funny there, with your shorts and stick. You tell lies. Lili told us already. - Already. - What? You saw that idiot scared of spiders. She's not an idiot. She's scared of spiders, but that's normal for a city girl. Rose is scared of them, my mum too. Maybe, but she's too snooty. She walks like a mason scared of breaking tiles. I bet you find her pretty too. Not especially. Ever spoken to her? She doesn't speak to me. Even my mum doesn't understand her. Your mum's French is poor. Your hut's not bad now. We'll finish tomorrow. I'd like to sleep in it. Me too. Stop copying me. I bet you didn't check the traps. I guess they ate well. Who? There! We'd caught a jay. If we aren't on time, they are. We'll make up for it tomorrow. Sure. You don't catch a jay that easily. - Look out! - What? A spider! I'm scared of spiders! Help! Help! Poor Marcel. It's a talent for trade. Some have it, others don't. - Can you haggle, for instance? - No. So watch and learn. Buddy, plums at 15 a pound? Think we're Americans? Here we go... They're from Languedoc. So we pay for the trip? - Mr Pagnol! - Yes. I'd never shown you this. Good, isn't it? The rock partridges! I'm pleased with it. My moment of glory! Ever since, you're a local hero. Hey, I did my bit too. - Dad shot them! - With my help. So handsome! You've grown a lot. It's for you. I have another for the presbytery hallway. - What an honour! - It depends. Joseph... Very kind. Thank you, sir. - Thank you, Father. - God bless you. There's no need. - Your best price, joker? - As before. I'll fetch the bread. Can I come? If you want... I'll pay for their trip, but not first class. Three to make ten... - Thank you. - Goodbye. Hello. Fancy! Mr Joseph is back. That's nice. Yes, indeed. For the summer. Until September. Lovely. You'll make the most of it. Yes, indeed. So, what can I do for you? Ladies... Ma'am. Finished? You're very observant. What can I get you? Bread. I imagine, but... Three loaves. Three loaves. The children? The what? Yes, a few buns too. A few buns... He often forgets his children. Fancy... We're back. Yes, indeed. See, you needn't have worried. Only yesterday, she was wondering where you were. She's not like that with everyone. Staying long? Until September. That's nice. You'll make the most of it. Indeed. Is the baker's wife as lovely as ever? What? You're not lying to me? Nothing happened with the baker's wife. She imagines things. Talk to her. Maybe we exchanged looks. At the same time? What? Looks are exchanged at the same time! How many looks? How should I know? Do you count your looks? No. That's true, I don't. Were they separate, short looks or one long look? It was a look... Who cares? A single look, long or short, is enough to get Augustine suspicious. They have vivid imaginations. - I'll go. - Where? - To talk to her. - Don't. Don't do that. Go on then. - But... - Go on. Are you ok, Marcel? Dinner might be late. Really, Augustine, darling, you're imagining things. Maybe there was one look. But when you buy bread, you look at the person looking at you, don't you? It was just a brief look. Me with a crush on a baker's wife? Joseph! Stop or I'll leave! Don't play that game. I don't care what happened. I'll say this once only. Never mention it again. - Ever. - But... I have work to do. You're looking at me. Yes, I looked at you. With an odd air. You didn't see that. I can sense it. Does it bother you? Yes, it does. You're feeling guilty, then. About Lili? How did you guess? You don't care about him. Does he care about me? He's my friend, but I'm not his slave. He's upset because I don't help him. Would he help with my homework? You don't do homework, you play with that girl! It's my holidays. The last before middle school. So I'll enjoy them as I see fit. If you saw her, if you knew what her place is like... you'd understand me. Will you take me one day? We'll see. I hold you, you hold me by the chinny chin chin... My daughter... So this is the knight who hunts the viper and lambasts the spider deep within its lair. Pages of my castle, sound the horn in honour of the hero who saved my first-born. A few lines for you, Marcel, for coming to my Babette's rescue. He's so brave, Papa. A real hero. I didn't do anything extraordinary. Modest too. A sign of greatness. Let's celebrate this archangelic encounter. The thing is... I have to go. This boy is a blend of Bellerophon, Parsifal - and Ulysses. - I know him. My father made me read the Odyssey. A man of taste then. Perhaps you've heard of him. He's famous for shooting rock partridges. What's wrong? My father loathes hunting. I loathe it. A barbarian practice. I'd sooner shoot a hunter than a rabbit. Meanwhile, Infanta, for the poet you must without delay prepare the green-eyed absinthe, that nectar, pray. Right away, my poet. A liar, a real liar! Yes, a liar! Why? He said he was seeing Lili, but saw that girl instead. Rubbish! Everything's nice and clean at her place because she's his girlfriend. You move fast. I agree. Before getting engaged to Rose, I courted her for months. Seven months and 21 days. If it's serious, you must introduce us. He won't! He's ashamed. Not true. It's... They're not like us. Like us? Meaning? They hate hunting. Her father calls it barbaric. He'd sooner shoot a hunter than a rabbit. Glad you warned me. If I meet him, I'll start munching a carrot. So, did the "great poet" recite for you? No, he composed. To say he wanted absinthe. - Absinthe. - He drank? Yes, for inspiration. It'll make him loopy. Absinthe is a poison. In excess only. Isabelle doesn't drink it. I hope not. Good! She plays the piano so well. She's at the Marseille conservatoire. She played for an hour, without a break. That's a long time. A song says it all in three minutes. Remember, Rosette, when I serenaded you? What a lot of nonsense! In vain, my beloved They try to make me despair Before your door that remains closed I shall stay and say my prayer Suns may go out Night may chase day Hold on! Lie down. Do you want another pillow? - Shall I undo your dress? - No. Is that ok? Breathe. Don't tell anyone. Not a word. You need to rest. We'll find an excuse tomorrow. An excuse? - You're in no state to go. - Rose! - What? - I'll go. - You won't. - I will. - You won't. - I'm going. I won't play ill. But you are ill. We'll work it out, as usual. Things work out. Let me see your hands. You're so grubby! Long live obligatory washing! - They love it. - Good. Don't empty the tank. You never thought I'd install running water. It just shows... Not only Christ works miracles. Ferdinand? He's on time. Bye, children. - Bye, dears. - Bye, Mum. Where are you going? To Aubagne. To shop. Dressed like that? How should we dress? Such fancy clothes might seem disreputable. No worse than shooting innocent animals. Hunting feeds us. - Shopping does too. - Ignore them. Sweetheart! Mummy's beautiful! - You too. - Stop copying me. - I'll come. - You abandoned me yesterday! It's women only. Let's go. Goodbye, dear. - Doesn't it seem odd? - No. Why odd? - It must be me... - Yes, it's you. Mum! What is it? Let me help you. Please. We're stopping here? Why a doctor's? About time. Marcel... Hello. No kiss for Aunt Fifi? Do you mind him attending? Not at all, but... What will Joseph say? Marcel can keep a secret. Especially if no one's hurt. Meet Madame Dromard, who is kind and brave enough to host us today. - Ma'am. - Please... Call me Huguette. Welcome. Come on. You've no idea of my fight with the education board gentlemen, who could not bear the idea of a female school head. A female school head, yes. But only after obtaining my husband's permission. School head, yes, but a woman and inferior citizen for the law. School head, yes, but with no legal authority over her own children. School head, yes! But a woman who defers to her husband, as "head of the family." In Finland, women already have voting rights! They can stand for election. Just think! With La Fronde, we shall fight for a fairer world for women. And embark together on this inexorable march for progress. I'm a princess imprisoned in a castle guarded by two dragons. I'm waiting for a knight brave enough to free me. I'll be the knight? Who else? Why would he save you? Because they're in love with each other. He could hunt for treasure too. Castles always have treasure. I'm not enough for you? Will they marry? Don't rush things. It's a long game. To ensure the knight is worthy of her love, the princess sets a number of tests, including the two dragons. Who'll play the dragons? You have to imagine them. Your parents maybe. That was a joke... It's not funny. Let us wassail and feast. What a banquet! Eat well, my liege lord. You're welcome, Majesty. My hero! You're looking handsome! Is that cologne? A little, by accident. I'm ready! For what? To go to the château with Marcel. No, not today. You promised! I said, "We'll see". You promised! I said, "We'll see." He wants to see for himself. It's normal. See what? We read, do plays... He'll get bored. No, he's bored without you. Look. Just this once then. Great! Thanks, Marcel. Let's get you ready. You can't go in your underwear. - Hello. - Lili. We don't see you much. Is Marcel here? No, I'm afraid not. What's wrong, poor kid? Marcel forgot him. He forgets everyone. He's that age. Augustine! Youth is no excuse to act like a fool. You never acted like a fool? Marcel promised to show him the château. The château... Not a sound! - Like Indians? - Yes. That's her. I don't see Marcel. Fetch, boy. What the hell? Good dog. Good dog. Again. That's very good. You get your bowl now. Nice, isn't it? Yuck. I've seen enough. Me too. Am I a girl or a boy? A girl. What else? Look around me. A young girl. All alone. You're slow to catch on. Tell me. Everyone has secrets. Where do you live in Marseille? Where's your school? Pass the last test and you'll know everything. What is it? Carry out a feat. A truly heroic feat. Whatever you want. Hurry. We leave tomorrow evening. Tomorrow? But the holidays aren't over! As if my parents cared. If you want to save me, succeed! And I'll be yours. Did I say what I paid? Yes, three times. - And three times too much. - Here he is! Well, time for walkies? Lost his ball? You wouldn't take him to the show, so Lili did. I hear it was worth it. Save me a front-row seat tomorrow. Count me out. I'm too old for the circus. Marcel, wait! - He forgot his bone! - Please... Happy now? Proud of betraying me? I didn't mean to. Why did you take him? He wanted to see the château. But we saw that. It was a game. A game to mock you! I don't like my friends being mocked. As if you care! You wish you were me because you find her beautiful. Maybe I do, but I don't wish I was you. You never could be anyway. City folk and country folk are different. I know we're different, but we can still be friends, right? Tonight, I'll brave the Taoumé snake. Are you barmy? I promised. I gave my word. Promised? Who? That girl? With that stick, the snake will have a laugh! Can I borrow it? I'm coming with you, then. No need of a traitor. Marcel! Your brother couldn't play Horseman and Princess? Knight and Princess. Knights rarely run on all fours. And never bark. It was a game. The princess is bored and plays with her dog. No game is innocent. She treats you like a fool. My son won't play the clown for a drunk's daughter. I'll have a word with him. No use, they leave tomorrow. Never mind. You were ashamed to introduce us. Now I see why. Don't go back there. - Even to say goodbye? - Even for that. She lives in Marseille, doesn't she? - I don't know where! - Good. You hate me being happy. Marcel, really. You mock her, me and her family without knowing them. I offered to invite them here. Dad didn't want to! You know why. They're nobles with a château and fine furniture. They're rich! He's jealous and wants me to stay like him, counting money, haggling over apricots or buying junk furniture! Isabelle doesn't need a scholarship for school meals or to buy books. Enough! - It's the truth! - The truth? You little idiot! You don't know what you're saying. Do you? More than you. So tell us about the baker's wife. Go to your room. Right... Who's doing dinner? I think it's your turn. All right. I'll show you. Excuse me. No, he's grounded. He'll spend the summer studying. It's normal at his age. Age has nothing to do with it. I was his age once. I did stupid things too. But I respected my father. All to your credit. Your father and you is one thing. You and your son is another. Spare him the burden of your exemplarity. You know... if I'd had to follow my father's example... He's been in your class, drinking up your words... Now, he's growing up, looking at girls, having his secrets... Like all of us. You're angry and upset. Your father and me too. You shouldn't talk to him that way. But he doesn't want me to be happy. No, it's the opposite. You'll realize one day. One day... You always say that. I don't care. I'm big now. Not yet, fortunately. I'm lucky enough to see you grow. I make the most of it every day. If only you knew... - I'm scared. - Of what? Of you being ill. I heard you with Aunt Rose. Oh, Aunt Rose... She exaggerates. You promise? Don't fret. Dad and the baker's wife, is that bad? They're grown-ups' problems. Things always work out. What if they don't? Then we live with them. French Republic Scholarship Done your grammar? I'm tidying my workshop for winter. Dad... I want to apologize. For what? Talking that way. Meaning? As if... As if I'd... Felt ashamed of us? I'm ashamed of myself. We have two days left here. Off you go, grub! Lili's at the fair with his father. - He didn't say? - When will they be back? They're there all week. I won't be able to say goodbye. Lili will be sad too, you know. You'll be glad to get back to the city. Yes. "My father, moved Handed his loyal hussar a flask of rum and said 'Give that injured fellow a drink.' Suddenly, as the hussar bent down to him, The Moor aimed the pistol he was holding At my father's brow, shouting, 'Caramba!' The shot passed so close that his hat fell And his horse jolted back. 'Let him drink all the same,' Said my father." Victor Hugo. Captivated, Mr Lamb? Lamb! Me? Lamb is your name, isn't it? Quiet! Despite appearances, this isn't a sheepfold. Who was Hugo talking about? Marcel's father. Marcel's father... Zero. Recreation, gentlemen. Exit in silence. Sir... Could we learn a poem by Loïs de Montmajour? Montajour? Who's that? Loïs de Montmajour. Never heard of him. But congratulations. You made Hugo's father sound like yours. Lamb wasn't so wrong. I told you so. I'll erase your zero. - Seriously? - Scram. Let's go. I prayed the Lord I'd sit next to an ace. He granted my wish. I'm the Lamb of God! The Lamb of God, but... They'll see I let you copy. For my father's sake, I can't lose my scholarship. I'm not stupid. I'll leave a few mistakes to mislead them. - I have my tricks. - Your tricks... With you, I might not have to repeat the year again. Try working. Finish the year well. That's my seat. Sorry, we didn't know. Sorry who? Pégomas... Mr Pégomas. Mr Pégomas. Clear off. You too. Why does no one resist Pégomas? So as not to wake up in hospital. And the supervisor does nothing? He doesn't want to wake in the hospital either. What do you want of me exactly? Just come with me. - That's all? - Yes. - Nothing else? - No. That suits me. Seen this? Get lost, you! They're just sardines. Sorry, no Isabelle de Montmajour in the piano class. Maybe it was the accordion. Thank you. Do you want to enrol anyway? Not at this paper, son. He corrects others' mistakes. Pujol! Heard of a proof-reader called... Montmajour. What's that, an aperitif? He writes poems too. He's a poet. Sounds like that drunk we fired. - Cassignol? - Yes, Cassignol! He must've drowned in a barrel since! But Montmajour, no. I'd remember. Sorry, son, someone's teasing you. Come on. It hurts to see you upset. Are you after the girl or her father? - The girl. - Damn! It's serious then. - Why? - Because I say so. I'm useless at school, but I know girls. Not the one I'm looking for. Dear Lili, It'll be Christmas soon. Like we said, I'd like you to come and see Marseille. I'm sending this tram ticket so you won't have to pay. I can't wait to see you. Marcel. What's that? A ticket for the tram. That's kind. A bit too kind. I could have paid. It's kind to invite your friend for Christmas. Your grades plus Church and State separating made my year. That's the lady who brings the bed for Jesus. Where does baby Jesus go? - Want me to tell you? - Joseph! Traditions. Superstitions. Let's line them up to welcome baby Jesus. Even the sheep. Pagnol! I asked you a question! Pagnol, are you with us? I repeat... Master of the house, in the genitive, singular and plural. "Domini, dominorum." No idea. Here we have someone who started the year well and... lets himself go. He's letting himself go. Might you be a bit simple? Zero! Your first zero! Well done! - What's wrong, chicken? - I don't want to go. You don't? I'm scared it'll make bad memories. Don't fret. We'll say you were sick. I bet he isn't really sick. How do you know? He didn't want to see you. Shut your pie hole. Chase two hares, you lose both. - Who taught you that? - Sleep. Uncle Jules taught me that. A snail climbs the trunk of a tree, covering three metres each day. I repeat, three metres each day. But... Each night, it descends two metres. - Why? - Think in the corner, Mr Lamb. Not fair. I was interested for once. Two hours' detention. What distance will the snail have covered after a week of seven days? Who cares. Four hours, Mr Lamb. Your parents will be glad to see less of you. I'll collect your work in 20 minutes. I asked Nguyen to make a caricature of the teacher and... - What's wrong? - Pégomas! He said, "Scholarship pupils are rats eating off our money." I called him a big pig. And bam! He called us what? - Rats? - Yes. That's funny? Enjoy this. Marcel, don't screw up. Scholarship pupils are what? Miss Scholarship's got her knickers in a twist. She's riled. If you don't get it, I'll explain. The supervisor... Go home to your mother. If you know her. You're a hot shot. - Where is he? - You scared him off. You have a scholarship? Show me your card. A savage like him shouldn't be at school. We agree. That said, young Pagnol, a savage... Look at my son! Of course. I demand exemplary punishment. Exemplary! Count on me! Pagnol, Joseph. Your father teaches at Les Chartreux? What'll he say if you lose your scholarship? Will I lose it? You, alone. - That's what happened. - Are you sure? You were far away... A few metres. Do you confirm that? - Papa, scholarship pupils are... - Shut up! Show him in. My boy, bravo for defending your honour against this privileged fool who dares to humiliate those weaker than him. I request that this boy should not be punished. As for you, after apologizing to your two classmates, we'll have a long talk at home. My cretin of a son shames me! - Papa! - A real cretin! All right... That's settled. Return to your classmates. Say hello to your father. Do you know him? I was in his class. You never forget a teacher like him. She's been ages. Stop worrying so much. Consultations are always busy. That's true. "Mr Seguin never had any luck with his goats. The goats are bored here." See how well I read, Uncle? You know Mr Seguin's Goat by heart. It's too easy. Here, at random... Read this. "La Fronde." Crumbs... "A women's newspaper made for women." What's that? What is it? Meeting Sweet Jesus! Joseph! With our surnames. Both of them. Present at meetings! And what meetings! It was hard to tell you. I'm dishonoured! Dishonoured... Jules, wait! - Where are you going? - To drown myself. What a joke... What's wrong? - What did the doctor say? - Nothing much. - I need air and rest. - Is that all? That's all. You all look so odd. - I should have told you. - Yes. After all, I'm not Uncle Jules. For me, women are my equals. I won't attend again, even if I support the cause. I don't want it to harm you. The education board can be spiteful and jealous. Why jealous? Your father is an upstanding and free man. They hate that. Imagine when he gets his decoration. The decoration I've been promised so long... What decoration? A reward for an exemplary career. When is Fifi's next meeting? Why? I won't be going. Want to make me happy? Go. Sorry? Go. Above all, don't forget over the summer, that there isn't just one consul, there are several... Have a good summer. Have a good summer. Pagnol. Congratulations on rallying so brilliantly, my boy. Your last report proves it. I'm truly sorry I said you were simple. I thought you didn't like me. How funny. I thought it was you who didn't like me. Today was my last day here. Enjoy the summer. Hey, hot shot! Detained again? Until the bitter end. Guess what. I'm moving up a year. Don't bother. Are the shrikes back? What do you care? Do you have to keep following me? I'm not. I spotted three hares around here. - Where? - As if I'd tell you... Marcel! You're barmy! The other way! Grab him! You had him. He's getting away! Come on! Marcel? She's back on Sunday. I couldn't care less. I'd be ashamed to go there. She'll think I'm a coward. You have to see her at least once. Or she'll haunt you like a ghost. Prettier than the Taoumé one, but a ghost anyway. I'd need a good reason though. Maybe I know where your good reason lies. Carry out a feat. A truly heroic feat. And I'll be yours. Pétugue's snake. Wretch! Never enter the Taoumé cave, understand? Never! Why a net? If ever we capture it. Who? Félix? Yes. Well, his ghost. The snake. Gently. Say if you're scared. I won't mind. We'll come back. You too. I won't mind if you're scared. We'll come another time. I'm ok. I'm ok too. See that? There! The snake? Félix, is that you? An eagle owl! It was an eagle owl! A huge owl. Shall we go back? - Maybe not. Look. - Oh, no. We have to wait. Would you like him to come or not? The main thing is to have fun. Marcel, wake up. Lili! Marcel! - There! - Your dad and mine. Oh, Lord... Jules too. We'll get a thrashing. They'll get the thrashing they deserve. - Do you know where they set traps? - Not really. My son knows these hills. Almost as well as... - Maybe he's out. - He's here. Here goes... Ed, it's François! Who else imitates a partridge that badly? Our kids are missing. Your kids? As long as I live, nothing goes missing here. Watch this. Coming? That's a dumb game. Dumb like me. Wait. - Look. - What? Near the rock. A snake. Impossible. It has ears. Not its own. It's swallowing a hare. It's huge. Sweet Jesus... The snake... It's Pétugue's snake. Pétugue's snake... It's too risky. We'll send it to the Marseille zoo. People will remember us. And put flowers on our grave. There, it's tiring. You've done your feat now. Marcel! Boys! A fine specimen for the Marseille zoo. Let's applaud our heroes. Let me through! It's Pétugue! Good Lord! That's your snake? Mine was twice as thick and three times longer. Compared to mine, this one's a bit of string! Let's be charitable. Absinthe rots the brain. The heroes on the cart. Come on! This one will be in the paper. All right, don't move. A big smile! - Drat! - No... Well, well. - Bravo, Father. - Just our shoes! Just his shoes! Sweetheart... Stop it. It's all right, we recognize your shoes. Poor Marcel! Unless she recognizes your shoes, what can you show her? - I'll show her nothing. - What? If she wants me, she takes me as I am. Or I'll leave with my head held high. Bailiff 16,000 francs without funds. It's you, Robert. - Marcel. - Sorry, I get confused. How dare you? You can't talk like that to Loïs de Montmajour! Impostor! Swindler! A swindler! Isabelle is upstairs. Go up. Pen-pusher! You're nothing but a petty little Javert, sir! Sounds like that drunk we fired. - Cassignol. - Yes, Cassignol. He must've drowned in a barrel since. Cassignol. It's a fiasco. It's scandalous! Outrageous! You must vacate the premises by morning. Final warning. - Vermin! Scoundrel! - Tomorrow morning. My father fell out with the paper's editor, a jealous idiot. He's been hired in Paris, in a much more important position. We leave tomorrow. I looked for you, even at the Conservatoire. - How dare you? - They don't know a Montmajour. You were misinformed. I won the top prize. - Is that your name? - Call me a liar! I asked about your father. No one knows him! You want to ruin everything. - Why not tell the truth? - The truth? My father is the victim of a plot. If you can't understand... What can I do? Weep. That at least. Weep? I'll help you. A farewell piece will make you weep. Especially if I play it. Mum! Dad! - Sonny. - What's wrong, angel? You seem pensive. Maybe he loves us, deep down. You're Marcel? How do you know? I saw the priest take your photo with the snake. You're really brave. She's a fine girl! Come on. Even without our photo in the paper, people recognize us. Maybe we'll get our statue. You're keen on that. Don't be so dumb. C'mon, don't be dumb. Let's go. Marcel! Watch this. Come on, Marcel! Lili! The Pagnol family in 1905 at "The Time of Secrets". A few years later, Augustine died of her illness. She lies in the cemetery at La Treille, a few steps from the country house. Young Paul became a goatherd and raised his flock in the Etoile hills that he always refused to leave. Lili of Les Bellons, whose real name was David Magnan, died in battle in 1918 in a trench in northern France. Until his death in 1951, Joseph regularly frequented his son's film sets. The majority of Marcel Pagnol's films were shot in the hills of his childhood. Subtitles by Ian Burley
