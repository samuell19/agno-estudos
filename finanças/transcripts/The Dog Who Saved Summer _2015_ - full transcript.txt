Ah, summer. The kids are out of school, the parents are out of patience, and the sprinklers are ripe for playing. That's my house right there, and this is where our story begins, just another Saturday afternoon for the Bannister family. That's Belinda. She's quickly becoming one of the top party planners in town. - Where's George? - And she's got her hands full. George? What is he doing? George? George, I'm talking to you. What? Belinda, I'm in the weeds over here. What are you doing? You look like a campfire. My eyes are burning. I thought the girls might want some Bannister bacon buffalo burgers. Honey, that sounds very heavy. Well, they're char-broiled. I need you to go inside and check on the kids, and get yourself cleaned up. Okay, but you relax. I think the party's going great so far. That's me, Zeus, you know, like the Greek god. Anyway, this is the story of how I saved summer. This is Agent Bannister reporting to command. I've reached the objective. Stand by for recon. All right, let's see. Looks like a member of the royal family. She's being guarded by some sort of mutant. Seems to be dripping acidic slime from its mouth. Whew. I'm going in. - Ben! - Princess is down! - I repeat, the princess is down. - Dad! - Abort mission. I repeat, abort mission. Ben, are you terrorizing your sister? - No. - Will you please tell him - to leave me alone? - Yeah. Leave her alone and go get lost, okay? And Kara, it smells like Riley needs a diaper change or something. - Can you take care of that? - That's gross, Dad. - Why do I always have to do it? - Because - I have allergies. - You do not have allergies. Yeah? Talk to my doctor. Come on, Versace. Let's get Mommy some clients. And of course, I wanna thank my dear friend Belinda Bannister for throwing the best baby shower I could ask for. - Thank you. - Thank you. You are so welcome and I'm just so glad that everyone's enjoying themselves. We'll do dessert and gifts shortly. - Okay. - Perfect. Oh, boy. I smell trouble, or maybe it's just too much perfume. Excuse me. Just one minute, okay? - Lovely shower, Belinda. - I know why you're here. I can't come to give a friend a little support? You just want to check out the competition. - And the grub. - Don't even think about it. Heh! Thing is, in order for you to be my competition, you have to be in the same league as me. Oh, call Marilyn for all your party needs... Weddings, showers, bar mitzvahs, quincea√±eras. I love your dress, by the way. You look beautiful. Okay, okay, fine, fine. Poach all you like, but everybody here is having a great time. Come on, Versace. Let's go mingle. I smell frosting. Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get down from there, now. Life is a banquet, and most poor suckers are starving to death. - Don't you dare. - Why? It's not chocolate. I mean it. Would it upset you if I just took a little nibble? - Oops. - The cake! Zeus! Pardon me, ladies. Do you have any Grey Poupon? Hey, you. Get back here. Where are they going? Oh, look, presents. Are those for me? Not the presents. Can't stop to smell the roses. Belinda's been working on this all summer. My garden! Nice shoes. Now I've got you! - Zeus! - Uh-oh. - You are in trouble, buddy. - Best party ever. It is a little funny. - Come on. - My nice party's ruined! You should have seen it. Everything ended up in the pool. And then George made the kids dive in to get everything out. And you thought your party wasn't going to be memorable. Ha! In the Bannister house, every day's a memorable one. Mom, it's not funny. This was supposed to be the kickoff for my big, new career. I mean, who's gonna hire me now? Don't you talk that way. Come on now. You've just made one little mistake. No one's going to even remember it. Oh, wait. Lillian Bland just tweeted it. Mom, I told you to stay off the Twitter. How else is the Firefly troop leader going to get the announcements out, huh? Mom, this is serious. Oh, honey, all you have to do is make sure - that it never happens again. - Heh. Famous last words. And how am I supposed to do that? Well, take the dog to obedience school. All he needs is a refresher. - Hey, go faster. - Stop. You go faster. - Hey. - Boys! Well, I guess it couldn't hurt to check it out. Oh, keep your chin up, sweetheart. Things always have a way of working out. Yes. Well, they can't get much worse, now can they? - Hey, we picked this for you. - Oh! Thank you so much. Isn't that sweet? Why don't you go with the other kids? Oh, Belinda, you'll never guess, two of the troopers just gave me a beautiful plant. Wait a minute. Is this poison ivy? Noah, Remy, this is poison ivy! Oh, my God, Belinda. I've got to take myself to the hospital. Do you know what I had for lunch today? Yeah, what, no. - Neither do I. - It doesn't matter. What we need to be doing right now is planning out our next score. Now you're talking, Ted. Got one of your great ideas? Two words, boys. Princivali Jewelers. Home to a very, very rare diamond. Medium rare? Passed down from Italian royalty rare. Tony Rosas will give us three mil a piece for it. - Oh! That's a lot of mils. - We're rich. So when do we boost it? Just as soon as we get out of here. Hey, I got the entire thing planned out right here. That's my Ted. Good news, fellas. Judge Martin says there's not enough evidence to hold you. - You're being released. - Oh, ho, ho, ho! - Let's do it now! - We're free. We're free. We're free. We're free. - Okay. - Not so fast. Not enough evidence to hold them. We got your face all over the security cameras. - What, no... - Pop a squat. You're going nowhere. - We'll be back for you, Ted. - Don't worry about it, Ted, because we're going to take care of that thing. - No! - We're gonna get the money and then we're going to come back and get you. Wait, no! You can't do this without me. - We'll be back, Ted. - We got this. We got this, Ted. They're doomed. Doomed. I love going to the mall in the summer. The families, the smells, the sound, the... Obedience school? Belinda, I don't think this is necessary. It was just a little mistake. George, a little mistake? Did you know that I have lost clients because of this? No, I didn't. Well, honey, if you were paying attention, you would know that this could cost me my entire career. Okay, okay, So I messed up a little, but who hasn't accidentally destroyed a backyard soiree once in a while? Is Zeusy in trouble? Honey, Zeusy just needs to learn how to behave better when mommy has guests at the house. It wasn't my fault. I was trying to stop Versace. The two of you sit down. Wait here for your father and I. Behave and watch your sister. I don't like this. I'm worried. The last time Zeusy did something like this, they talked about sending him back to the pound. Ben? Remote control helicopters! Glad to see you're worried, too. We're a small, selective school. Vernon only accepts a handful of students at a time and he never accepts a student he doesn't feel he can turn around. Oh, well. It was worth a shot. Let's go. Can you tell us just a little bit about the program? It's four days of intensive training followed by our annual Fun in the Sun Showcase. Ah, showcase. Well, that sounds like fun, - doesn't it? - It sure does. I can't wait to sit on the couch and watch it on TV. It's a chance for all our students to showcase what they've learned. It's a big production. I was telling Vernon we should hire someone to coordinate it. Well, you know, Belinda here is a party planner. - You are? - Yes, lam. If you're serious about needing some help, I would be happy to offer my services. I don't know. We already had a bid on one planner, - and Marilyn's got a lot of experience. - Marilyn? Uh-oh. That touched a nerve. - You know her? - How about this? I will do it for half of whatever she's offering. Belinda, half? You don't wanna seem desperate. Honey, this is a chance to redeem myself and prove that Katherine's baby shower - was just a fluke. - It was a fluke. Wait, you did Catherine Clancy's baby shower? The one where all the presents ended up on fire? Actually, they got dumped into the pool. - George! - It's funny. Okay. How about I will do it for 25%? How do you feel about a summery theme, like Hawaiian? - I feel great about Hawaii. - Belinda, Hawaii, it's so hot and there's all that lava flowing. Honey, honey, we're not going there. It's just a theme. But if it's, you know, authentic, am I gonna have to wear a skirt? Terrific. I will get started on planning that right away. - Good. - And in the meantime, - we will enroll Zeusy. - We will? Don't bring me into this. Yes, we will. Hey, Mom. Hey, Mom. Listen, I just want to thank you for referring me to that obedience school. Not only are they really trying to help Zeus, they hired me to plan the party for their big showcase. Anyway, thanks for the help. Talk to you soon. Bye. Oh, that sounds like everything is going good. Okay. Let's see. Rash may last five to 12 days. Oh, boy. Your canine does not know defiance, do they? - No, Vernon. - Your canine does not know fear, - do they? - No, Vernon! Your canine does not know failure, do they? - No, Vernon. - What do we learn here? - Vernon's way, sir. - And what is that? - Sit. Listen. Obey. - Louder. Sit. Listen. Obey. - Sorry, we're late. - You're in trouble, newbie. Yikes. Who is this guy? He's the PIC. What's that supposed to mean? You know, the person in charge. - Quiet, mongrels. - You. - Me? - No, the rocket scientist behind you. State your name. I'm George Bannister. And, uh, this is Zeus. He's a former K-9 police dog. Aw, isn't that redundant? - I don't know. - George, why don't you wipe that grin right off your face? Let me make something clear here. If you're looking for a sweet little doggie daycare center, then you get your little hindquarters over to Alice's across town. What I offer is a very serious, very intense behavioral training course. Well, there's any hope of a hind massage. And since you can't tell time, we meet every morning at 9:00 AM sharp. Am I clear, George? Yeah. I actually can tell time. I just tend... Am I clear, George? Yes. Yes, sir. Good. You hear me, Zeus? I'm going to break you so hard, you're going to be able to sniff your own butt. Anyone ever tell you that your breath smells like rotting mayonnaise? Apollo, let's show these new recruits how we do things the Vernon way. - Now, jump. - Yes, sir! Big deal. You can do that blindfolded, Zeus. Um, sure, of course. Blindfolded. Everyone, welcome to Sit N' Stay Obedience and Agility. Stewey, here's your disguise. I'm not wearing this, Fred. Quit whining. Ah! Look at the beautiful couple. Love is in the air. I can feel it. It is... electric. - Yeah. - How may I help you? Well, me and my girl here have decided to take things to the next level, and so, this little birdie told us that Princivali Jewelers was the best jewelers in town. That little bird, he knows his jewelry. Now, what style of diamond were you looking for? Something like in a diamond shape. Uh... A sense of humor. This guy is a killer. Why don't you two lovebirds browse around Mr. Princivali... he pick out a few selections just for you. Great. I'm going. I'm going. I don't want to do this. I don't want to do this. - Would you just stop? - I don't want to do this. Look, look, look. What? I'm gonna tell Ted you ruined the plan. - Huh? - I'll do it this once. Pull it together. Would you just... Just keep it together, will you? How come I always got to be the woman? Because you are the most beautiful eyes. - Really? - Would you knock it off? Okay. Here's the plan. He's going to come back, you're gonna distract him, then we're gonna go look for the diamond. Plain and simple. I'm sick of this. You do it. - I'm not going to do it. - Here we are. I have some wonderful selections that I think will look very nice with your particular... Repertoire. I'll tell you what, honey, why don't you try a couple of these on, and I'm going to go look at the rings over there. Please, I could not help but notice some tension between you and your fiance. - You're not kidding. - Because... if you were open to other options... Mr. Parvacelli, I'm a lady. Hmm. Bingo. Shall we? Your fingers are so thick and very European. - What do you think? - That's beautiful. Just shimmers. It is as lovely as you. - How does it fit? - It's a bit... tight. No problem. We just try the next size up. I just slip this right off of you. Look at the security in this place. Got cameras, motion detectors. What's next? You got lasers, too? It's just a diamond. But it's a big diamond. I found the diamond. I found the diamond. I have something in the back. It come right off. No. no. no, no. I got it. I'll pull it off. It happens all the time when I eat chocolate. We're so rich. Oh! - Did you hear something? - No, no. Ah! - Oh, no. - Please, let me help you. - Are you okay? - Yes. Here. Let me help you with that. - There you are. - So, next size up. No, no, no, no. I think we're good. Thank you very much for your time. - You can put that on layaway. - Bongiorno. Why do the good ones always end up with losers? One of the key steps in the Vernon way One of the key steps in the Vernon way is to instill a reward-based behavior in your canine. Oh, yeah. That smells delicious. If your dog does the instructed test, then he should be rewarded. Uh, Georgie? - I missed breakfast. - Bannister, will you and Zeus assist me with the demonstration? Not at all. That's what I'm here for. Come on. Sit. No, no, no. I mean, the canine. Oh, yeah, sure. Why don't you give the dog some commands, Bannister? Okay. Good idea. You okay, Georgie? You don't look so good. Uh, I just don't feel too good. What kind of treats are those by the way? - Those were dog treats. - Dog treats? Why would you give us dog treats? I didn't give them to you. They were for the dogs. Oh! Well, I should've put two and two together, but I just thought you were giving us treats - for being such good trainers. - How many did you have? Ah! Seven or eight. That doesn't sound too good either. - Uhh... - Um... Okay. Here's a command. Zeus, come with Daddy. Heel, heel. Come with Daddy to the bathroom right now. Or lay down and Dad will go to the bathroom. Okay. I'll see you in minute. I expect more movement from you, Bannister. Oh, there's going to be some movement all right. I'm Colby and this is Buster and Relish. - Pleased to meet you. - So you really 5-0? - Yes, sir. - Then how come you're so bad at this? K-9 police dogs, all a bunch of wimps if you ask me. What makes you so special? - Apollo's a former marine. - Really? Semper fi, my friend. Until you sniffed the sands of Afghanistan looking for unexploded ordinances, you don't have the right to call yourself a hero. This dog here is all puff. I say he's phony and has no skills. What do you got to say about that, meter maid? - You sure do drool a lot. - You're in my world now, K-9. You better get used to doing things my way. Like that nice dog collar you got. - Hand it over. - I'd rather not. I wasn't asking. What the... Hey, my collar! What are you going to do, officer? Arrest me for stealing? Isn't he just a dream? More like a night terror. Mm-hmm. I thought a K-9 never backs down. Oh, boy. You've gotta be kidding me. What are you guys doing down here? Okay. ls that better? Can you hear me now? I got you. I'm a 2A. I tried to get an A in the front door's way, it's impossible's way. What? We tried A, in the front door A but we couldn't get in it. What? I don't understand what you're saying, Stewey. I think what the good Father is trying to say is... ls that we need a new recipe for grandma's apple pie because the one we have now is too complicated. You ever heard the saying if you can't climb the fence, dig a trench. No meshuggah not. No, 'cause I just made it up. All right? All right, look, the point is this. Okay, maybe you could look at the joint next door. What I meant, I bet you the recipe at the doggie school - is much simpler. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. What dogs? You know I don't like dogs. No dogs. - The one with the apples. - Oh. What you gotta do first is you've gotta get survey of the mall before you go. That will tell you how to find the apples. Why don't we just buy an apple pie and get it over with? What he's saying is we go down to the city hall and we get the plans to the mall. Then we dig a tunnel into the vault and then we get the diamond. - Sorry. - So are you two numbskulls gonna go make Uncle Ted a pie? He always knows how to make me happy. I want you guys to make me happy. okay? And get me out of here! Ted, I miss you. Well, how did Zeus do? Not good. He didn't listen to one word I said, and he lost his collar. Remember the collar? That's genuine leather. Lost? More like stolen. I can't listen to this. No one believes me. Zeusy... Maybe you just got off on the wrong foot. Belinda, this has nothing to do with my feet. I'm not going back there. Discussion over. Look, George. I am now planning their annual showcase. I mean, how is that going to look if you quit? Like I have common sense. And Zeus. What about Zeus? I mean, let's not forget the whole reason that we're doing this. We? What's this we stuff? I'm the one down there dealing with Sergeant Slaughter. I'm not going. I'm fini. - Really? - If you quit now, there is a very big chance that I'm going to lose this account and then Marilyn is going to get the job. So, please can you just do it for me? There are only three more classes. Okay, but can we re-evaluate after two? - Yes. - Great. Come on, Mom. I was supposed to hang out with Gage - before the sleepover tonight. - Honey, Gage can wait a half an hour. And Katie and I were supposed to go to the movies. Kids, I just need to get a few supplies for the party. I don't get what's so important about this. It's just an obedience school. Okay. Well, you know what's so important about it? It's my only client. Okay. - Hot pink or sky blue? - None of the above? Mom, if you're going to throw a Hawaiian party, then you can't get the cheap plastic leis. Everyone gets those. Come on. They keep the good stuff over here. What? Oh, since when has she been here? Here. These are silk. They're stronger, more durable, and don't look like a Kindergarten luau. Sweetheart, you are very good at this. Do you think I could convince you to stay on and plan a party for Mommy? Well, well, if it isn't my best friend, Belinda. Planning for the big shindig over - at the obedience school, are we? - Yes. Well, at least there's one client left in town who has good taste. Hmm. Well, since I've managed to snap up pretty much every other gig in town, I suppose I can let you have this one. Let me warn you. You mess with the bull and you will get the Bannister horns. Go, Mom. All right. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Just let me do the talking, okay? How come you always do the talking? Because I'm the only one with brains. - Can I help you? - I love you. I mean, what I mean to say is I love you. What, my colleague, Don Juan is trying to say is we're looking for the survey for Lot 23, Block 1133. Well, you've come to the right place. I just need a driver's license. Stewey McMahon. I'm Marsha. That's a beautiful name. We're in kind of a hurry. Do you live around there? Actually, I'm looking for a place since I got out. Got out? I was in jail for a little while. - What? - Nothing major. Credit card fraud, extortion, hijacking, breaking and entering, impersonating a circus clown. Do you believe in love at first sight? I have astigmatism. - Can you bake? - I'll put you in a sugar coma. Right, the survey. Um, it's normally $5 but this one's on me. Thank you. You're beautiful. Oh, and, um... - It's pig's head. - My favorite. - Au revoir. - We'll be seeing you. - Come on, Zeus. It's easy. - I don't know, George. Looks a little dark in there and, you know, I'm a little claustrophobic. You're a disgrace to the uniform. Come on, buddy. Follow me. Don't get stuck in there, George. You're unfocused, Bannister. You need concentration, discipline. Oh, man. Whoo. It's hot in there. I felt like I was in a lower intestine. I'm sorry, were you saying something? I couldn't hear you. Yeah, focus, concentration is the key to proper command training. You can all thank Bannister and his so-called K-9 police dog for allowing me to give you this assignment. I need 10 laps around the perimeter right now. - Really? - Let's go. Come on. Hut, hut. Let's go, Apollo, hut. Show them where to go. Let's go. It's not me. It's Zeus. Zeus nothing. If your wife was not giving us a good rate for the party, you would not be in my class. Move out. Come on, everybody. Keep those legs up. Come on. Keep those legs up. Get those dogs in heel position. Come on. Come on, Georgie. You can do it. Mush. Mush. I don't know, Zeus. I haven't run like this since that sale at Black Friday. Ah! Just pretend Vernon is a brand new 70-inch TV, half off. We gotta catch him. Come on. You're keeping us all late. Come on. - Yeah, I don't know. - Gotta pick up the rear. Come on. - Okay. Okay. - Come on. You can do it. All right. According to this, all we gotta do is get in the work tunnel behind the obedience school. Just let me do the talking. - Fred. - I'm stuck. So am I. Just back up. I'm trying. - After you. - After you. - After you. - No, after you. That's it. Hold on, hold on. - Really, Stewey? Come on. - I fart when I get nervous. Well, there's nothing to be nervous about. Sure, there is. I hate dogs. Big dogs, little dogs, skinny dogs, fat dogs. Why does it gotta be an obedience school? Because it's the only way into the vault. Can I help you? Yeah. We're here to inspect the pipes. The pipes? Well, a few stores in the area reported smelling... gas. Now that you mention it, hmm, yeah. That is pretty bad. Well, that's why we have to check the pipes downstairs, make sure everything is copacetic. What do you need a sledgehammer for to check the pipes? Rats. Big ones. Go ahead. Just please take care of that smell. We intend to. - After you. - After you. What are you going to do with the $3 million? Stewey, I don't know. Okay, everybody. Get up. Keep the canines at a tight heel. Make sure you keep them at attention. That's everybody. We're the last two. Hope you learned your lesson, Bannister. All right, everybody take five and make sure you hydrate. I'm gonna sit here and just pass out for a minute. Zeus, give me some water. Oh, poor Georgie. Vernon's really picking on him. Face it. You two aren't just Sit N' Stay material. Maybe you're right. Oh, and if you're looking of what's left of that collar, I'd check the basement if you want it. Maybe I can get it back while Georgie takes a nap. You rest. I'll be right back. Sucker. You know where we're going? I know exactly where we're going, Stewey. - I can read a map. - I'm a little scared. No, it's this way. Last time you told me you knew where you're going, you didn't know nothing. Well, that's odd. I don't see my collar down here. There he is. Uh-oh, I smell an ambush. Buster, Relish, get him! Where do you think you're going? You can't hide from us. Wait, shh, you hear that? - Quiet, I'm thinking. - Fred, I hear dogs. Stewey, I just said, "Quiet, I'm thinking." Just passing through. - That dog looks familiar. - They all look the same, Stewey. - Ah! Fred. - Don't say it. - I hate dogs. - I hate when you say that. Let's go get the diamond. I hate dogs. Help! Georgie, Vernon, anybody! Hello? Over here. I found him. This was way too easy. Hey, hey. hey... wait for me. What's the matter, flat foot? Did someone hurt their head? Look at him. He's out cold. Apollo's gonna put you in a doggie bag. Some K-9, huh? Book him, Danna. Hey, I think I hear someone coming. Look, it's that custodian guy. Get out of here. Let's go. It ain't worth it. This ain't over, Zeus. Uh, where am I? Who are you? Not one for conversation, huh? My collar! Yes. Thank you. Oh, it looks great. The big one. Mr. Vernon's dog, he picks on you, doesn't he? Maybe a little, but I can take care of him. You're just too proud to ask for help. I know you mean well and I could probably use some help. It's just that, no offense, mister, but you're... - You know. - I know what you're thinking. "Mr. Lee is an old man. What is he going to do to help me," right? I feel like I let Georgie down after everything he's done for me, and I can't even roll over? What kind of dog am I, Mr. Lee? I can't face him. Not now. What should I do? Well, help Mr. Lee plug in the radio. That really wasn't what I had in mind. Need music. Pull the cord. Okay, but if we're going to listen to music, you should know, I'm partial to Three Dog Night. That's a boy. We'll just go through these boxes here and here and this way and that way. Yeah. That'll do it. Here goes nothing. That's it! Oh, baby! Good music. Well, now I tell you what I'm going to do, huh? I'll teach you how to stand up to Apollo if, in exchange, you be my assistant. What do you think? Do you offer health benefits? Do we have a deal or not? - Put her there. - Okay. You come back tonight at 10:00 and I'll teach you lessons, all right? You bet, Mr. Lee. I won't let you down. Good dog. Bye. 10:00. This is gonna be great. I can't wait until tonight. So, Mom, when you said if you mess with the bull, you get the Bannister horns, what exactly did you mean? - Well... - You said that? I had no idea - you were so tough, Mrs. B. - Well, I'm pretty tough. Well, it's just an expression, honey. It means that if you antagonize the bull, then, well, you know. Whoa. Who are you and what did you do to Belinda? So you're the bull? - Yes. - So if someone were to ruin your party, you would have to get even? - Exactly. - Wait a minute. What exactly are we talking about here? - Oh, honey? - Yeah? Um, were we going to try the grilling again? Yeah. I thought we'd have some delicious BBB & B. - The Bannister bacon... - Buffalo burgers, yeah. Ooh, I'll take two. You know, honey, the last time they were a little bit charred. Oh, it might have been the meat. - Dad, watch out. - Duck! - The burgers! - No! I think we should take a moment of silence. That's it. You're going to get this back after dinner. Aw... - Honey, are you okay? - Yeah, I just tweaked my back in obedience school. Oh. This class is really something. On a scale from one to 10, I'd give it about a 15. Have you considered just talking to the man? Belinda, that man is a monster. You just tell him that his opinions have no effect on you and that he should pick on someone his own size. Yeah. Well, easier said than done, honey. Okay. Honey, why don't we just order a pizza? Ooh, ooh, extra pepperoni for me, please. Okay, sounds like everyone's asleep. Nice night for a walk. Mr. Lee? Are you here? Hello? Mr. Lee? Hut, hut, hut! Color pole. - This guy is not messing around. - Hut, hut, hut! Oh! Well, are you ready to begin lessons, my friend? Am I? Well, then, follow me. Let's get started. Come on, Zeus. Come on. Yeah. We're going to have a lot of fun. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. Come on. Let's go. Now, lesson number two. You go over there. So, what are we gonna do first? Learn some canine karate? No, plant paw on the box. Or I could just help you close a box. - Plant paw. - Sure. That's right. Now, wait a minute. Back straight. Now, firm like a rock. - Like that? - Hold it. How am I doing? Don't forget your packing slip. So when do we get to the good stuff? Now, plant paw again. - Okie dokie, Mr. Lee. - That's right. Back straight. 20 more boxes coming. - You're gonna have fun. - This isn't what I had in mind. Hey, buddy. Why do you look so tired? I spent all night packing boxes. I'm tired, too. I only had eight hours of sleep last night. Must be nice. This is called weave walking. Note the poles. The goal here is to navigate the obstacle course without knocking them down. In order to succeed, your canine will have to utilize self-control and speed regulation, and, most importantly, grace. - Apollo, weave. - You got it. To the left, left, right, left, bam. - Like taking candy from a baby. - Good boy. Don't worry, Zeus. I'm sure you used to do this all the time down at the police academy, right? I mean, you should be able to do this with your eyes closed. Oh, yeah. Eyes closed. - You bet. - All right. Okay, here we go. Oh, here. Okay. Okay. Here we go. - That's it. Mind your pole. - Left, right, left. That's it. Good work, Relish. - Hey, I got little legs. - Slowly, slowly. - Bear with me. - Don't skip any poles. - I'm not skipping any poles. - Very good. Whoa. Whoa. ls the room spinning or is it just me? George, I've been thinking. I don't think this whole school thing is jiving. Why don't we just go home and you can rub my belly? Come on. Come on, Zeus. Zeus. Come on, Georgie. Don't make me do this. Come on. Come on. Hey, George. Watch out. George, are you okay? - Come on, Zeus. - Stop! Watching you is so painful, I think I'll rub my eyes with a scouring pad to ease the pain. You know what, Vernon? This whole thing is so silly anyway. Having a dog zigzagging out of here. - Zeus is a very intelligent canine. - Couldn't have said it better myself. This is more like, you know, K-4 stuff. Stop it. Stop laughing. I needed that. I needed that, George. Thank you. Do you mind if I retort? No. Go ahead. Retort all you want. Unless you want to spend the rest of your summer tasting the gum on the bottom of my boot, I suggest you learn to respect my authority. - Do you get it? - Yeah, I get it. I'm just not a gum chewer. I like mints, peppermints. What kind of cop were you anyway? - Meter maid? Good one, Apollo. That is not funny. Why don't you go and write yourself a ticket? 'Cause all you do is sit there and this is a no parking zone. Well, it looks like three out of four of you are getting it. Class dismissed. You know, Zeus, I can't wait to get home, plop down on the couch and eat a big bowl of popcorn. Can we stop at Redbox on the way home? You know, Barrister? Bannister. Whatever. I think I've seen garden snails with better spines than you two. Thank you. I can't wait to see you make a fool of yourself at the showcase in two days, meter maid. Listen now, Apollo has an appointment with a fire hydrant. I'll be right back. Don't touch anything. Hut! You know what, Zeus? Popcorn can wait. - I got some work to do. - Where are you going? Right here. You sure that's where it's at? Yeah. According to that map, the Vault's right on the other side of this wall. Get it, Stewey. Ah! Why don't we just go around the front? Wouldn't be that the easier way? You're kidding me, right? I mean, you do realize that the mall security would grab us within 10 feet. This way, we go through the wall, we open it up, we take our time. And I'm not just talking about the diamond. I'm talking we're gonna clear out everything. Do they got ice cream in there? Yeah, of course they have ice cream. All jewelry stores have ice cream. You gotta know when I break in, I get hot. When I get hot, I sweat. When I sweat, I want ice cream. - Yeah, maybe. - Mint chocolate chip? Give me that. What was that, Vernon? Are you talking to me? Huh? Well I'm the only one here. Are you talking to me? Huh? You do know that's just a bag, right, Georgie? Why don't you taste the gum on the bottom of my boot? Whoa, Georgie. Where did that come from? Man, Zeusy. I don't even know my own strength. Maybe these classes are paying off after all. Oh yeah, Vernon? You know what you get when you mess with the Bannister bull? You get the horns. Way to go. This one's for the money. What's wrong? My hand's killing me, Zeus. I think we got daylight. Fred, how did I ever doubt you? - I wanna look inside. - No, wait, wait, wait. I think it's appropriate that we take a moment to reflect on what lies on the other side of this wall. - Yeah, a big hunk of diamond. - No, no, no, much more than that, my meager-minded companion. It's an opportunity for a brighter tomorrow. It's a chance to break the constraints of our sparse, criminal existence and prove once and for all that two moderately intelligent guys like us can make it in this cold, cruel world. I'm Verklempt. I'm going in. Get out of the way. Come to Uncle Stewey. Fred! It's not the vault, Fred. What do you mean it's not the vault? - It's not the vault, Fred. - It said so right on the map. - It's not the vault. - You said it was gonna be easy. Oh! I was reading it upside down. Don't worry about it. We'll get it on the next one. We better get Ted. We better get Ted. So how are we going to break my brother out of jail? I'll think of something. - Oh, come on. - Thank you. Let me know if you want another. Stewey, you've got to be kidding me. That's your third helping of pancakes. I think better when I eat. - I got it. - Let's hear it. We take a van. We drive into the back of the place, right? Boom. First you get out and make sure the coast is clear. Then I make the move for the ladder and I climb through an open window. Once I get to the cell block, I'll make my way to the guard. Then I'll give the Vulcan neck pinch. Hold up. You're going to jump through the window? - Yeah. - What? You're going to make me say it? Say what, Fred? You can't jump through the window because you're... you're scared of heights. You're right. You know what? I'll keep my eye on the guards. You go through the window. Go, Fred. Go, go, go, go. - We've got this, Stewey. - Come on, hurry up. Go. Ready to get out of here, brother? You're the best, Fred. You are strong. Come on, come on. Let's go. Come on, come on. Guys, come on. Let's go. Freeze! You've got to be kidding me. Might as well tie chains to the bars and have it pulled off with four horses. This isn't the '30s, Stewey. There's cameras everywhere. - So what's your plan? - I don't have one. Wait a minute. You know what? When I was a kid, my mom had to break my Uncle Joey out of prison. All we had to do is get the tools to him inside so that he could get outside. So you're gonna break the tools into the place? No, no, no, no. Not break. Bake. What do we got in the fridge? Hmm. Got some tuna, some mayo, a bag of pork rinds, Dijon mustard, a little salami, a little bologna, a little liverwurst, and a can of fresh sardines. That's disgusting. Well, it doesn't matter because no one's gonna eat it. Our only problem is how do we get it inside to Ted? You know what? Leave it to me. You got a visitor. Uh... and you are? Marsha. I'm a friend of Stewey's. Wow, I really must be cooped up in here too long. Uh, well, what are you doing here? Your friends made you a cake. A cake? You know, a cake. Oh, a cake. A cake, yes. Hold it. Hold it. Why don't you eat some of that right now, tough guy? Uh, well, I had a big breakfast. No. No. I insist. - No, I'm trying to watch my figure. - No, no, no, no. You want it or not? Yeah. Yeah, all right. Of course I want it, yeah. - I mean, it's just a cake, right? - It's just a cake. Little creamy cake. Oh, yeah. Yeah. It's a cake. Um... - Take a bite. - Okay. I'm gonna take a bite. - Just a cake, right? - Yeah, let's see. I can't wait. It's going to be... Oh, gosh. That's good. - Okay. It's a cake. - It's cake. - It's a cake. - It's good. You want some? No. Oh, it's got a kick. Kinda fishy. Compliments to the chef. - Yes. - Thank you. Oh... That's my baby. Hey, I'm Mario Lopez and tonight on "Extra" we're going to take you to Miami. The wildest summer hot spots, the... Who is this guy? I like his style. The hottest summer fashion trends. We're also going to show you how to dress like... George, what are you doing? Watching TV. No. I mean, what is going on here? Are you giving yourself a manicure? Of course not. If you're referring to my hand, I think I fractured my pinky. Okay, George. I think it's time that we discuss the fact that this whole obedience school thing just isn't working out. Zeus hasn't learned a thing and you are a mess. Belinda, there's no discussing it. I can't quit. I quit, Vernon wins. And I'll have you know, Zeus looks up to me. I don't have any choice. You're four feet taller than me. And man to man, I will not let him down. You know, I love you no matter what, Georgie. Hey, what are you doing with my phone? Shh! I don't think things are going too good with the obedience school. All right. Give it back. - No. - It's my helicopter. No. I need to hear this. Zeus is in trouble! What? Remember when Mom said if you mess with the bull, you get the Bannister horns? Yeah. Well, she said if someone were to ruin one of her parties, she would have to get even. So? So if Zeus doesn't pass this class, she wants to take him back to the pound. You really think so? Okay. I'll see what I can do. - Just give me the controls back. - No, no! No, no, no, no! Did you just hear that? I don't know. I'm hearing a bunch of stuff. I think I might have a slight concussion. Okay, George. Why don't you take all the stuff off and come downstairs and we'll watch a movie together as a family? Well, honey, I need a little me time. Okay. I'm going to go and see what Mr. Lee is up to. Good night, Georgie. So what kind of awesome self-defense are we going to learn tonight? Well now, tonight's lesson is catching a rat. Rat? What do you mean rat? Rat trap on the other side, see? We catch and we free. What do you want me to do? You scare the rat, he hear you bark, he run across the room and right into the trap. I am not going in there with a rat. Mamma Mia. If you cannot handle a rat, how do you expect to handle Apollo? Fine. What do you want, you beast? Look, I don't want to impose and you look like you're busy, could you please do me a favor and act scared? No, not gonna happen. Now, scare rat. Bark like a dog. - My ears! - Good. Good. Good. Keep barking. Scare rat. Scare rat. Uh, later. Ah! That's one rat. Now we've got 25 more to go. We're gonna have a great day today, buddy. All Zeusy and me... Hey, Zeus. Where are ya? Come on, buddy. We're gonna be late. We have to stop at Grandma's on the way. What, you out chasing squirrels all day? Come on. More like a rat. - Ready to go? - What do you mean? - Coming with you. - No, you're not. Why not? It's just obedience school. I just wanna scope it out. No, no, no. Did you put him up to this? No. He just said he's genuinely interested in going. Okay, fine. If you wanna go, you can go. - Thanks, Dad. - We're gonna go set up for the showcase, okay? - Kara's going to help me. Bye. - Bye, guys. - I think I left something upstairs. - Zeus, where are you going? Come on, buddy. You can't play hooky. Go get him, will you? Don't give me the eyeballs, okay? I have a bad hernia. Ben, you and Zeus wait in the car. I'll be five minutes. Hey, Eve. How are you, girl? How do you like staying with Grandma? - What's up, guys? - Oh, hey, Uncle George. Yeah, I'm watching the boys while Randy and his wife go to their bowling league. - Look at this. - What's in the box? - Yeah, let's see. - This is amazing. Yeah, I told Grandma I'd bring some cool stuff over - from where I was in the Fireflies. - How nice. Wow, look at this backpack. I can use this on my hiking trip. Can we set this tent up in the backyard? Why not? And feathers go perfect with my uniform. - Yes. - Hey. guys. Why don't you go say hello to Ben and Zeus? They're in the car. - Oh, please do. - Tell the boys I said hello. So, the kids treating you all right, Annie? Of course, they are. Oh, those are great kids. I love them really. They're no problem at all. Everything all right there, Annie? Hmm? Oh, this. Oh. This is just a little poison ivy. I'll be fine. The doctor says she should be fine tomorrow. Hey, listen. How is obedience school, huh? Yeah, um, well, it's tough. I gotta tell you it's the most grueling thing I've ever done. I mean, I come home. I'm tired, I'm bruised. - Okay, but how is Zeus doing? - Oh, Zeus? - Yeah. - Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good, yeah. Although I don't think he wants to be there. - Really? - Yeah, I get that feeling. You know, some dogs just don't change. Oh, that's a shame. Look at me. I've been told a million times, but I still drink out of the toilet bowl. There's just something about that fresh, cool water. Ooh, I think I need a drink. All right. I'm gonna get going because Ben and Zeus are in the car waiting and class starts at 9:00 and I can't be late. Oh, gotta get there on time. Okay. Well, thank you so much, George. Oh, jeez. Okay. All right, well, uh, you be good, Annie. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. This is gonna be great. - Okay. - I love you. - All right. Get some cream. - Okay. Here we are people. You made it to the last day. We almost lost Bannister here in the process, but sometimes, even the tortoise finishes the race. Slow and steady wins the race. Ah, and today, you brought some help with you. Maybe he can teach you some pointers, yes? The final lesson is walking the teeter totter. This will teach your dog balance and precision. Apollo. Just like this, boys. Show off. I can't wait to see you fail, meter maid. Begin. No sweat. All right, here we go. Apollo, watch this. Very good, very good. Do I really have to do this? Lam exhausted. - What's his problem? - It's a board thing. He's doesn't like teeter tots. He doesn't like diving boards. I definitely don't like tall buildings. Zeus, follow me. Like this. Uh, hey, George. I think I'm supposed to do that. - Hey, Zeus. - Hey, George, you're pulling too hard. You know, Bannister, I regret ever giving you a seat in my class. That seat should have gone to a more worthy student. And, you, a guppy would have benefited more - from my instruction. - Yeah. That's right. Zeus. - You're a fish. - Dad? Listen here, puppy Rambo. I got news for you. You can push me around, you can mock me, you can make me jog until I puke. But don't ever, ever, ever de-animalize my dog. Yeah, Georgie. You tell him. Let me tell you something. Zeus has more talent in his hind than your little wolf dog does. - Really? - Really? Really. - Prove it. - Let's not and say we did. - Name the place. - Tomorrow's showcase. Well, that's not fair. Apollo's not even a student. You got it. You're gonna be seriously embarrassed. Yeah, we'll see who's embarrassed. Dad, what did you just do? I don't know. I don't know. I'll be honest, Zeus. I thought you were the dumbest one in this class. Apparently, I was wrong. You just wait until tomorrow. He can't even go on the teeter totter. Okay, mongrel. I'll play your little game but when I beat you, that collar is mine. And this time, I'll tear it to smithereens. And if I win. I want an apology from you in front of the whole school for the way you've been treating me. Okay, Zeus. Anything you say. Oh, boy. Buddy, I don't know what's going on. I don't feel good. Quick, George. Let's make a run for it. We'll join the doggie protection program. I think I'm gonna be sick. Mr. Lee, we have a problem. Come on. That's right. Boy, I really have problems now, Mr. Lee. When I say throw away, you'll throw this away. Got it? Yeah, look, I'd really love to spend the day helping you unpack boxes or catching rats, but this is serious. Throw away. Mr. Lee, we Bannisters always recycle. Good boy. Come back. This isn't what I came here for. - I need to learn. - No, more work. - Work? - Throw away, huh? We have 20 more boxes to open. I can't help you throw away bubble wrap. George is upstairs puking up his nerves and I got a showdown with Apollo at the showcase. Well, you are concerned? Whatever gave you that idea? You're nervous about tomorrow, huh? - Oh, boy. - Can you help me make out a will? Fear is only in your mind. It is your heart and spirit that will help you defeat Apollo. Now, come back tonight and we will finish your training. - All right? - Oh, I wish I could share your confidence because right now, I don't know how this day - could possibly get any worse. - Goodbye. Come on, Zeus. Jump over the hurdle like we did in class. Oh, I'm sorry, George. Let's try it again. Okay, buddy. Come over here. Come here. Here. This is what I wanna talk to you about, all right? I'm really sorry about bringing you in on this whole Vernon thing. Just for a silly little bet. - You're more important than that. - Believe me, this obedience school has been hard on the both of us. And by the way, don't ever listen to anything that jerk says. I don't know how we're gonna do it, but we're going to do it tomorrow. I know you're gonna try your hardest. Thanks, Georgie. You know I won't let you down. Here's the thing, buddy. You're not a normal dog. You're special. You got great genes. And most of all, you're a Bannister. What do you say we call it a night? Poor Georgie. It's not his fault I can't balance on a teeter totter or crawl through a tunnel. I can't let him down tomorrow. And I know just the person that can help me. Okay. The coast is clear. Ready to finish your training? Yeah, about that, I know I helped to catch rats, unpack boxes and even plug in your radio, but shouldn't I learn some real skills? I'm gonna get my hindquarters kicked tomorrow. Let's review scare the rat. I don't get it. You run through the tunnel and scare the rat like last night. That's just like the tunnel George crawled through. Wait a minute. After that, pull the cord. And the weave poles. And then plant the paw. And the teeter totter. Then throw away. Remember, throw away. I never realized. All right, you got it? You got it now. Get all pumped up. Heart and spirit, here we go. Let's begin! Pick up the pace. Come on. No, not fast enough. Do it again. Weave, weave. Come on, come on, come on. Throw away, throw away, throw away. Atta boy! Okay, boy. Hut, hut, hut. Come on. You're gonna have to do better than that if you're gonna beat Zeus. This is steep. I've got the pedal to the metal. Come on. You can do better than that. Faster. Up. Down. Up. Come on. Up. Down. Tunnel, tunnel. Yeah. Whoa, very good. One more time. Come on. Scare rat. - Keep going. - This is heavy. Wonderful. Atta boy. Let's go. Teeter totter. Yeah. Okay, now that'll win. That'll beat Zeus. I don't like Zeus. Come on. Let's go. That's it. Faster. Faster. Come on, faster. That's it. Good dog. Come on, sweetie. Hurry up. We have to drop off Riley at Grandma's on the way. Okay, Zeus. Big day today, buddy. I hope you're ready. Uh-huh, uh-huh. And then right before the nap, he needs a bottle, a warm bottle. Well, not too warm, but, you know, warm. Yes, and then he also loves to sleep with the little bear, the one with the floppy ears, not the long ears. No, floppy. Not long. And then also he wants that blanket with the little tags on it. He likes to have it right on the side... This isn't my first rodeo, you know? No, Riley and I are gonna be fine. Aren't you, Riley? Bring that little food dropper over here. I know. I'm sorry. I'm just... I guess I'm just so nervous. I keep remembering the last party with all the presents falling in the pool. Well, did you bring your scuba gear? - Not funny, Mom. - Don't worry about it. I've got all the kids over from the troop making beaded necklaces. Aren't we, kids? Yeah! What is she doing here? Oh, she's... Waiting for me to fail so she can pick up the pieces. Mom, I've gotta go. Give Riley a kiss for me. Talk to you later. I love you. Bye-bye. Oh, yes. What do you think? What do you think about that? Uh-oh! Whoa, did somebody give Grandma a present? Oh, yes, you did. Hey, where is your brother? Oh, um... I think he said he had to go to the bathroom. Right now? This is Agent Bannister reporting to command. I've reached the objective. Stand by for recon. Ladies and gentlemen, the moment we've all been waiting for. The man, the myth, the legend, Mr. Vernon. Hello, everyone. Thank you all for being here on this special day. Our canines can now show you what they have learned from our new program. And as a special treat, five-time champion Apollo has returned from retirement to challenge the new class. - Apollo. - You might as well - give up that collar now. - Stay gold, pony boy. All right, our first challenge will be the tunnel. Apollo, tunnel. Military coming through. That's my boy. Just like training for Desert Paw. Show off. - Colby. - Come on, Colby. I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. Whee-hee-hee! - Zeus. - Mr. Lee, which skill is this again? Scare the rat. Scare rat. - Come on, buddy. - Here we go. - Yeah. I did it. - Yeah! How did you pull that one out, Bannister? Well, folks. It's been a heck of a contest here. We're gonna move on to the teeter totter. Buster. Come on. Come on. Good job, Buster. Apollo. - He's just the best. - Yes, he is. Zeus. He doesn't even know how to do it. Plant the paw. Plant the paw. Atta boy. Whoo! Go, Zeus. Shall we move on? Jump! Relish, fail. Throw away. Stewey. We don't have all day. What are you doing? That's odd. Where is he going? And now, folks, we'll move on to the speak command. Hey, what are you guys all barking at? - Buster. - Sorry. - Fail. - Can we go home now? All right, give me the survey. Give him the survey. Stewey, really? I didn't have a napkin. He's a messy eater. All right, this looks good right here. Plug this in. - You stand watch. - Aye, aye, captain. What did I tell you about calling me that? I forget. Let me know when we're good to go. Good to go. Ted, Ted, Ted, I could do this. - No. - Come on, Ted. Let me do it. Fine, but don't do anything stupid. Have I ever let you down before? Do not make me answer that question. Watch this. - Ah! - No, no! - Way to go, Stewey. - You can do this, Stewey. Uh-oh. - What is it? - I thought I heard something. I'll go check it out. Hey, what are you doing down here? I'm, uh, stealing diamonds. Uh-uh. - Oh, uh-huh. - You better watch it. I was Bruce Lee's teacher. Oh... Chuck Norris. Well, folks, our final challenge is the weave poles. And it seems that we only have two dogs left. Something"; wrong. Mr. Lee wouldn't miss this. I think he might be in trouble. Okay, buddy. We've made it this far. Right? Ready for the next trick? Sorry, George, but I've got to save Mr. Lee. Mommy, where is Zeus going? I don't know, sweetheart. - Zeus! - Bannister. You walk off and you are disqualified. What? Belinda, stop Zeus. Let's go, hon. That dog isn't getting away that easily. You go bring him back. And Apollo, if you get a chance to finish him off, - sweep the paw. - But, sir? - You have a problem with that? - No, sir. I'll get that coward. Zeus. Where is that dog? Zeusy! Let's go. You can do this, Stewey. Careful. Careful. Whoa! Whoa! I can't do this. I can't do this. - You can do this. Come on. - Pull it together, Stewey. I can do it. - I don't think he can do it. - I don't think so either. Oh... Good job. - Good job, Stewey. - Way to go, Stewey. Mr. Lee, are you down here? Mr. Lee? My canine senses are detecting something. You can run but you can't hide, Zeus. I never knew he was so agile. Good job, Stewey. Go, Stewey. Do it, do it. Ted and Fred? You have gotta be kidding me. What's going on? What are you doing? - Apollo? - I knew you were a coward, but I never figured you for a quitter. You think I came down to quit? I came down here because it looks like we've got a crime in progress. - What did you see? - Two perps and it looks like they're trying to steal something on the other side of that wall. Maybe I was wrong about you, Zeus. You might just be a K-9 police dog after all. - What do you say? - Wanna lend me a paw? A joint task force... The police and the US government? - I love it. - You find Mr. Lee. I'm going to go save summer. Mr. Lee has to have something I can use. This will work. Mr. Lee, where are you? Mr. Lee. No, no, no! Stewey, it's a weighted scale. You have to take the diamond off and put something else on at the exact same time. - Like this. - Like a balance. - Stewey! Come on. - This is no time for condiments. - Stewey, put away the fruit. - Jeez. Okay, a sandwich. That's good, that's good. But it's too big. It's too big. Take a little off. Take a bite out. A bite. Don't eat the whole thing, Stewey. That's too much. You can do this, Stewey. Come on. Are you ready? We're gonna be rich. We're gonna be rich. He's gonna do it. He's gonna do it. Come on, Stewey. On the count of three... One, two, oh! Yes. Yes, Stewey. - Yes. - Way to go, Stewey. Stewey, get out of there. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, Stewey. - Come on. - Ted. Ah! Check the food court, okay? Look... oh, check the dumpster in the back. We gotta find him now, Belinda. I would. I would, but vicious Vernon won't let me leave. If I leave, Zeus fails the class. And listen, I'm not going through another week like I just went through. It was brutal. Okay. What? Hello? Hello? Ugh! Good job. Let me see the diamond. Let me see the diamond. Let me see it. Oh! - Oh, yes. - Way to go, Stewey. Look at that. Peek-a-boo, you robbers you. - No. - It can't be. Zeus Bannister. I'm gonna grab him, I'm gonna smash him. - I'm gonna make you pay. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Good idea. - Ted, where are you going? - Where are you going, Ted? Your brother just left with the diamond. Well, guess that leaves just the two of you. Don't just stand there. Let's go get him. Oh, there you are. Let me get this. Thank you. - Come on, Stewey. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Oof! - Trip wire. Nothing a little plastic surgery can't fix. You should have told me about the trip wire. - I tried. - I tripped. I tripped. I tried. - Well, come on. Let's go. - Let's go. Dah-dah, dah-dah! Wait a second. He's always got something waiting for us. An egg could drop on our heads or snow will blow on our faces. Let's get him, but be careful. Well, what are you, a man or a mouse? Let's go. Up here. - Fred. - Watch for traps. I got it, I got it. Look. You're right, Stewey. He put kibble all over the stairs. He's probably trying to make us trip. I told you, Fred. Don't underestimate this dog. Yeah, well, no more funny business. Now it's time for business business. Let's go. Okay, Zeus. What's the plan? You take Fred. I got Stewey. - Get that dog! - Take that. ' ' Oof! ' ' Oof! You wanna run, dog? Yeah, come here. Come here. Wise guy, huh? - Right in the family jewels. - Hope you're wearing a cup. Ah! Beautiful. Shoo. Shoo. Go away, chopper. Shoo. Shoo! - Get off me! - Ah! - Get off me! - Ah! - Freeze. - Thank God you're here to save us from those rabid dogs. Come on, hands behind your backs. I saw the footage from my vault security system. This is the man who took my diamond. What are you talking about? We haven't seen this guy before - in our lives. - He's the guy who tied me up. It wasn't me. It was a girl with green eyes. I skin you like... - Nuh-uh. - Uh-huh. I didn't... ow! He kicked me. Zeus. Here you go, buddy. You rescued Mr. Lee and you stopped the robbery. That could have ruined summer. You know me. I could never let that happen. - Apollo. - Mission accomplished. Speaking of which, where is the diamond? I got him. Get away. Shoo! Leave me alone! Oh, he's going down. Shoo! Shoo! Get out of here. Okay. Uh, no, no, no. Oh, I'm sorry. Were you going somewhere? Ah! Shoo! Shoo! Oh, oh, oh! Oh, busted! Yeah. I found this, uh... - Ted, stop. - It was just sitting out here. - What? - You are under arrest. I... no, I... I didn't do anything. This is that nail file bandit who just broke out of prison. Ow. Oh, really? You want my autograph or something? No, but my wife wouldn't mind a manicure. Ha, that's funny. Ow! All right. You write that joke yourself? - Yeah, I did. - I know how to do this. I've done this before. Ow. Zeusy, there you are. What is going on here? We wanted to make sure nothing got in Zeusy's way, so he would win the showcase, so he wouldn't have to go back to the pound. Honey, the pound? What are you talking about? You said if you messed with the bull, you get the Bannister horns, and Zeusy ruined your party and... Oh, sweetheart, Zeusy is a part of our family. I would never send him back to the pound. Ever? Ever. Oh, come here. Come on, everybody. The show must go on. Yeah, he's doing really well. And get this, he even foiled another heist. He foiled another heist? That's amazing. Yeah. You remember those guys Ted and Stewey? The two that robbed your house. Yes, yes, those guys. They follow us around all over the place. - They must have a GPS on us. - I never want to see those two again. I swear, if I ever do... I hope this time they're going away for a long, longtime. Bannister, we're waiting. Oh, okay. I gotta go, Annie. They're calling me, okay? Good luck and I'll see you when you get back. ' Okay-Bye-bye. Sounds like your brother came through once again. Of course he did. He's a real hero. Ladies and gentlemen, sorry about the delay. Let's try this again. We're down to two dogs in our final challenge... The weave poles. Apollo and Zeus. - Apollo. - No mercy. Apollo, weave. Come on, you can do it. You know what, Zeus? I've had my time in the sun. It's someone else's turn. Apollo, what are you doing? Retiring. Zeus, weave. Here we go. Come on. Zeus, this is it, buddy. You do this perfectly, we win. Pull the cord. And weave. Yes! Yes! Well, folks, it looks like we've got a new top dog here in our Fun in the Sun showcase... Zeus Bannister. Good dog! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Atta boy, Zeusy. - You bet. - Heart and spirit. I couldn't have done it without you, Mr. Lee. I don't know how you pulled this one off. I believe in miracles, sir. Great work, kid. That was some bravery you showed today. I'm proud to call you my friend. Thanks, Apollo. I'd like to take a moment to chat about next year's party. Personally, I feel your sensei deserves something of a higher caliber as opposed to this tacky, grade school Hawaiian theme. Mr. Vernon and I were thinking the same thing. Glad to hear it. And we'll be sure to discuss that with Belinda. I guess I kind of misjudged the two of you. Yeah, well, we all make mistakes. Yes, but you two seem to make more than most. I know. Belinda tells me every day. I was thinking of bringing in someone new to teach these special skills to a future class. Oh, I'd be honored to, sir. Just let me clear my schedule. No, I was talking about your canine. You bet you, Mr. Vernon. Zeus Bannister reporting for duty. Oh. Yeah. Okay, sure. But, you know, I'm gonna have to drive him, so I'll be there, too. It's a deal, George. Now let's kick off this summer on the right paw. My eyes are burning. I thought the girls might want some Bannister bacon buffalo burgers... Let's keep going. Let's keep going. Can you go change the diaper? Why do you always have to do it? I mean, why do... Man to man, I will not let him down. Or my cucumbers. - You all right? - Yup. Sorry about that. Cut. Good luck, Elisa. Thanks, Gary. No. He said he really wants to go. Kara's said... Shh. Almost have it, almost have it, almost have it. Come on, come on, come over. Move your legs. Good girl. Take it to him. Take it to him. No. Throw away. You missed the first one. Go across. Teeter totter. No, Buster. If you get a chance to finish him off... sweep the leg. Great. Good boy, Zeus. Yeah. You did it, buddy. You rescued Mr. Lee and you saved the... There goes the sequels.
