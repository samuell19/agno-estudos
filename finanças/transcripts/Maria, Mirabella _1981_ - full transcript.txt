Croak! Croak! Croak! Oh, it's so good that the spike is a spike, That the elephant is big and the the rabbit is little... little... That the coq is a coq and the lobster is a lobster That the butterfly is flying... flying... and I take a bath in the lake. Croak! It is so good that the Earth is turning always slowly And the water it is not spilled, so I won't drift in the abyss. It's so good that a spring does still exist and a lake is cleaner, And the lake reflects the sky all covered with stars! Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful, Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful, Oh, it is so good when the bees meet the flowers, When the crickets talk with the stars during the nights, When the frisky rain with grains of silver Ties up the blue, blue sky with the sweet, sweet earth. Oh, it is so good that there still is water in the lake And the cuckoo sings "cuckoo" and the frog sings "croak", "croak", And If I want to reach the moon, I would fly with a kite, Because there are all kind of fairy tales in this world and I am part of one of them. Croak! Croak! Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful. Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful. Croak! - Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful. - It is so good, it is wonderful. - Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful. - It is so good, it is wonderful. - Oh, it is so good... so good... - Croak! It is so good... so good... - Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful. - It is so good, it is wonderful. Oh, it is so good, it is wonderful! Ah! I'll be damned! He is "Sc?p?rici", my friend. - Oache! - Oh! I didn't know it was you! Again? It's such a barbaric custom, Oache! - To swallow your friends! - Forgive me! Forgive me! I've seen something great! Would you like to see it too? Come on! Come on! If my memory is still good... of course! These are our girls! - Our girls! - You talk too much, Sc?p?rici! They are just our girls! That's it! Yes... our girls! Sssh! Shut up! Omide! What a beautiful day! Isn't it? You've scared me a lot, you guys! You rascals! Hello, Oache! Bonjour... - Omide... - What's new... Sc?p?rici? - Oh... Omide... - Take it easy, boy! What about the girls, Omide? Have they recognized you? No... they forgot all about me. Maria said: "What a beautiful butterfly"! And Mirabela said: "There are a lot of butterflies like this one in here"! They forgot all about me... and I can't stand it! - I can't stand it! I can't! - Don't cry! Don't cry! Don't you cry anymore, Omide! Please... don't cry, Omide! - Don't cry! - They forgot all about you! - This is not possible! - Oache! Oache! Why can't we Turn back time? I wish everything could be like the first time! All those times are gone. They won't come back. We can only remember it. - And that's that! - Then... let us remember it! - Then... let us remember it! - All right. I will tell the story! Actually, the story began with me... It was... once upon a time... But it was really happened. I will never forget... That fairy day... I remember how the proud sun stood as bewitched in the sky Because at my place... at the springs... who do you think that came? Who do you think that came? The Fairy... The Fairy of the Forests! Croak! Croak! - Spring... - Autumn comes after summer... And winter comes again after autumn! And winter comes again... This is the nature of things! And it must be obeyed! - Thank you, Oache! - What for? Any child knows it! - It's for your gift! - Yes... but... what for? What is the gift you are talking about? I tell it because the frogs, in this world, Are good for nothing... Croak! Croak! That's a blazing lie! It makes water be frozen! It makes water be frozen! It makes water be frozen! It makes water be frozen! Croak! Croak! Croak! Croak! Hey! He is frozen! Oh! Oh! - Croak! Croak! - Croak! - Croak! - Look out! Here I come! Croak! - Croak! Croak! - Croak! Maria! Come on! Let's play! Look out! - Maria! Come on! Let's play! - It's a frozen spring! Have you ever seen a frozen spring during the summer? A spring... made all of ice! I don't care about the spring! Give me the ball! It's a frozen frog... The poor frog... he has frozen... Hey... the frog moves his eyes! It's a real frog! Come on! Let's play, Maria! - He is frozen! - Good evening, Maria! - How do you know that my name is Maria? - I've heard her calling you! Mirabela! Come here and you'll see a frog who speaks. Atchoo! Good evening, Mirabela! What do you know? So the frogs can speak?! Maybe you're a prince charming... yes... Yes... I am charmed... that's sure. But, unfortunately, I am not a prince! Oh... that's life! Eh... my name is Oache! How did it happen, Oache? How come the water has frozen? The Fairy of the Forests came here. She drank water... and she said: "I thank you, Oache... for your gift". And then... I've asked her: "What are you talking about? What gift?" And she was very mad... she got mad... she got mad... Look at me! I don't understand. I don't understand... How can I be useful? - I don't understand! - Maria, come on! Let's go home! I smell troubles! I tell you! Mirabela, do you know why the frogs are useful? They are good for nothing! The bees give us honey, the sheeps give us fleece The hens give us eggs and the frogs... croak! It can't be true. I am sure that the frogs must be useful in some way! Maybe you're right... but only the good Fairy knows it. - Maria, come on! Let's go home! - I can't leave Oache here like this! - We must talk to the Fairy of the Forests! - Maria, it's no time to joke! - You want us to find her?! - I would go to her, but I can't! That's the problem! Atchoo! - Croak! - Croak! - Croak! - Croak! Come on! Come on! Stay how you are and tap harder the ground! Come on! Come on! Up your feet and the ice will crack easy if we join our strength, Keep it like this... Don't give up and we will crack it! Come on! Come on! Stay how you are and tap harder!

And if you lose, we will go home. What do you think? - I agree! - Here! I have two prunes. And this one... I mean... I must hide both of them at my back! And you must guess in what hand is the squashed prune! It's in this hand! I'll give you one more chance! - Do you want to give it one more try? - Yes! - Come on! - It's in this hand! Hmmm! - Maria! Let's go home! - No. I'll find the Fairy of the Forests! I'll come with you too. It's raining! Maria, it's raining! Maria! Maria, it doesn't sound good for me! Let's go back... and find a shelter! Oh, my God! Wait for me! - Come on! - It is so beautiful! Look! There! Up... we are big stars, And as we come down... we become smaller stars and we are fireflies. The snails and the hedgehogs, the crickets and the ants are happy. They are happy Because they can see us everywhere spreading little stars. The big stars are burning... and the little stars too... We are fireflies. When everyone else is glistering, I get fried, I go up in flames on sight... on sight... I wonder what kind of life do I have since I am burning like a straw. Oh, my! This can't be called life! This is Sc?p?rici... the firefly! I am a firefly... without any glister... And my name is Sc?p?rici. I am Sc?p?rici, but I don't have any glister... I don't have any glister... I splash here and there I splash in the water... I'd rather be a hedgehog... What a firefly... without any glister... What kind of firefly am I? When everyone else is glistering, I get fried, I go up in flames on sight... on sight... I wonder what kind of life do I have since I am burning like a straw. Oh, my! This can't be called life! Sc?p?rici! Sc?p?rici! Come here, boy! Come on! It was just my impression? Or someone has actually called me? It's me... I am Oache, your friend! Say, Oache... who are those beautiful little girls? The little girls... ah! We go together to see the Fairy of the Forest! - I want to ask her to forgive me! - But what happened to you? Oh, my! I said something stupid and... look at me now. What am I going to do? My feet are frozen! Ah... I still don't get it! - And how did that happen, Oache? - I said to the Fairy of the Forests That "I was good for nothing" and she got mad... and punished me! Hm! What about a firefly... without any glister? That's the problem. We need her... both of us! Only the fairy... can help us! I think that only the Fairy of the Forests can help me to find my glister again! - Hm! Maria! Maria! - The hell with those beasts! Mirabela, we can't do this! We must help them! He is Sc?p?rici... my friend! Mirabela! Mirabela! Think it over before you do something! Oh! Oh! Mirabela, I am a frozen frog... Mirabela I am good for nothing... - Mirabela... don't hurt me! - Mirabela! [Echo] Mirabela, where are you? Mirabela! Mirabela! Mirabela! Sc?p?rici, have you seen Mirabela? Mirabela is a bad girl!

But the caterpillars... will die! - Why should they die? - They will all die... from hunger! Then... what can we do? We'd rather let the tree die? Or the caterpillars? I think that the caterpillars should die! Mirabela! That's right! Go away! But... why can't you eat something... better? Good girl... beautiful girl... don't joke on us! What could be better than a fresh leaf? - The pollen... from flowers! - Ah! Papa! The nectar... from flowers! - Oh! - And with spicy sauce! You make jokes on us, pretty girl! - We are ugly... and we crawl! - Ho! Ho! - Shut up! - Papa, that would be swell! And I would eat with such an appetite the nectar... from flowers!

Listen to me and do what I tell you to do! Swing now! And fly, children! Fly! Oh, my! It's something sublime! It's charming! Do you want to know something? We were also pollywogs Before becoming frogs! - I didn't know it. - Well then... I will explain it to you! It is something really exquisite! After the lightning it thunders And after the thunder it rains And after the rain... flowers can grow... And from flowers you can fly again towards the sun Butterfly, butterfly, - Butterfly, butterfly... - There are so many butterflies - So cheerfully colored! - Butterflies you may fly... These are silk staples! Can you see now, Sc?p?rici? The Caterpillars are useful in this world too, isn't it? That's the problem! Don't talk about it now! Just... look! And the little one will become strong... and the strong one will become grandfather... - Butterfly... - You have a new life when you're grandfather And even then all the butterflies are "running" in the grass...
