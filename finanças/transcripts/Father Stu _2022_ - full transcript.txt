In my thoughts and in my words. In what I have done. In what I have failed to do. ...failed to do. I don't know about this one. Through my fault, through my fault, through my most grievous fault.

You should've thought of that. Son. You can't fool God. Maybe no one's done it good enough. FATHER: Let us pray. STU: Cool to sit here? MAN: Yeah. Ham. Oh, that's beef. I'd know. No, my name.

You wanna do this with an audience? So how'd you know my name? You look me up? You wear a name tag at work. How did you find me? I asked God to show me the way. He took me down Santa Monica, left at the light and into this very lot. What do you know? What are you hoping to accomplish here? Well, hope ain't a tactic. I come to find the light. I'm looking at it. Does this tactic usually work for you? Stalking your prey and smothering them with cheese? Most things taste good like that. You like nachos? You say that because I'm Mexican? Is that right? I wouldn't know. I can't see shit, you're so bright. You like that one, huh? I have to teach. Well, I got a lot to learn. At Sunday School. For kids. I'm an actor. I can be whatever you need. You don't take "no" for an answer, do you? I don't need a "yes" to know I'm right. What do you think you're right about? You wanna let me take you fishing, but you're scared. I made a living reading fear in people's eyes. I was a boxer. What am I scared of? Getting knocked off your feet. Might take 12 rounds to get them on their back, but I'm a patient guy. Get me on my back? I'm a Catholic. No sex before marriage. Well, ain't that what confession's for? I thought that'd be the case.

Well, he said "porn." Kids, do you wanna read from--? It's the same thing. No. Get your Bibles out, please. STU: God wants us to give things up, he ought to stop taking from us too. He killed my little brother Stephen when he was 6. Took a nap, never woke up. How you square that one, huh? We can't understand why God does what he does. That's why I liked to box. How it went was up to me. I can't accept when I ain't got no say in shit. Our world teaches us that there's comfort in knowledge and fear in the unknown. What if the unknown was greater than we could possibly imagine? Hmm. I bet it could be. I believe in you. TIM: Confession. Acknowledging our sins in word, action, and omission, and resolving to not sin again. For this, we do penance, and are granted forgiveness. Like doing laundry. That's a Sunday thing too. [CHUCKLES] Here I thought it'd be all complicated. Well... I'm afraid it's not that simple. The essential part of penance is a firm and true repentance, motivated by faith, and the love of God. This is called perfect contrition. Imperfect contrition arises from a less pure motive, such as common decency, or fear of hell. Our whole lives, we're taught to be good, avoid bad. Eat your dinner, or you don't get dessert. Share your toys, or you get timeout. You're trying to undo years of wiring. That's a good observation, Stuart. Take heart. God is the ultimate programmer. I leave you with this task: Consider the changes you need to make in order to receive more abundant graces to sin no more. Cool. [PHONE RINGING] KATHLEEN: Hello? How come you ain't teach me how to tie a tie? Where'd you get a tie? My court appearance. Your dad never did like dressing up. Always said he wanted me to shine.

Can you hear me? [GROANS] [♪♪♪] [GRUNTS] Can you squeeze my hand? He's starting to come out of it. Damn thing ate my dollar. As if folks in here ain't paid enough, you gotta bleed their pockets too. Ain't you brought your own beverage? Son of a... Uh-- Where you going? What's it to you? Your mother told me you were dying. What the fuck? You sound disappointed. Well, I took off work to be here. You seem all right. Wait up, Stu. I forgot to give you this. St. Joseph. For the operation. Who's this? CARMEN: Who's asking? BILL: Stu's dad. I'm Carmen, Stuart's girlfriend. She know you're an atheist? He's baptized. He ain't dead. He can speak for himself. Is that true? Yeah. You know St. Stephen? CARMEN: Of course. Patron saint of coffin makers. There's pictures of him with a big pile of rocks on his head. Who'd have thought, you give your boy a nice Christian name, in a world full of fruits and nuts, you'd sentence him to live right on up to it? Or down, as it were. Into the ground. That ain't how names work. Let me drive you home, Mr. Long. Hey, you got yourself a worrier. Well, God will put me where he wants me to be. What's it to you if I'm in hell or Hermosillo? "Sillo." STU: Can we go? [♪♪♪] STU: You recall the guy who was drinking by me, last time I was here? BARTENDER: I haven't seen him before or since. He was probably just passing through. BARFLY: You ain't owed nothing, but you're getting a chance. Don't go driving now. CARMEN: I thought I could help. Answer your question, you know. Yeah? What you think I'm wondering? "Why me? Why did God make or allow this to happen?" He doesn't promise your stories will make sense, but he does promise they'll find their greater purpose. If we're patient. Patient? You an expert on that. What's going on with you? Most things get squished on a road, end up stuffed on a wall. I'm doing pretty good, considering. I know, but I'm concerned. Look, I got a lot on my mind, all right? Let me help you take it off. Don't do this. I know what I'm doing. STU: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been six weeks since my last confession. I can't... I can't give you details on account of there's a conflict of interest. The sacrament of confession is inviolable. I cannot, under pain of excommunication, reveal or act on whatever it is you confess to me. I did something I ain't supposed to do. Something I been thinking about, praying I could get to happen for months. Something I wanted more than anything else in this world. Then I had it, and all I could do was think about disappointing God. This is good news. It is in discovering the greatness of God's love that our heart is shaken by the horror and weight of sin. No, this ain't about fucking up. It's about being fucked with. Another term for that is "grace." God's grace. It appears you are the recipient. What's he expecting me to do with his grace, huh? You could start by... cleaning up your language. Don't be a wise-ass, Father. Answer the question. He expects you to spread his word, advance his kingdom. He ain't making house calls asking that. He must have made a mistake. No. Heh. God doesn't make mistakes. Father G thinks maybe I could serve God. You believe that shit? Like an altar boy? I've been thinking that since the day I met you. You have? No. But I'm sure he had good reason. My whole life, I felt like I shouldn't be here. That my brother Stephen should instead. But after that night, I felt different. Like I might be good for something after all. Perhaps the world needs another Rhinestone Cowboy. I think God saw something in you worth saving. But it's up to you to decide what you've got to offer. [♪♪♪] I thought it'd make sense being back here to do this. It's the place you told me you believed in me. I'm gonna be a priest. [CHUCKLES] What do you mean? It's five words. I've practiced them a hundred times. What part is unclear? Every part. You're gonna be a priest? Stop saying it like that. Like what? Like it's insane? So was the idea of the man upstairs pulling strings, but you bought that like a pair of shoes. God saved me and forgave me to show me that there's a reason I'm here. We need to have your head examined. Trust me, Carmen. I tried every way I know to talk myself out of it, but the truth is... I ain't never been more clear. Have you considered all this entails? Heh. Abstaining from booze and beatings, not to mention sex? You showed me I could do it. No, I showed you, you could wait. A vow of celibacy means never again. Then you die. There's more to life than sex. I can feel it. Most people know that, Stu. Only most people find that other meaning in a passion, or people, or a family. You're setting yourself up for failure. No. I been testing myself. If God's willing to forgive me, I got to be willing to forgive others. Whoever hit me, I wanted their dicks on a stick. But with God's help, I've forgiven them. And you think the absence of the instinct to dismember someone qualifies you for priesthood? You're delusional. Know what it takes to win a fight? You gotta turn off the animal brain, use logic, humility, good judgment. That's the struggle of man. I can do it. I can help. You got near death and found God. That's great, Stu, but... this is a little extreme. No, I didn't find him, Carmen. I felt him. I felt her. Mary. Well, that don't sound... Look, the feeling she gave me, I can't even explain it. For the first time in my life, I knew I could stop fighting. I knew I was safe and loved. I disgraced myself before God, so that you could have another flight of fancy. I know you're mad. You can hit me if you want. It'll make you feel better. I don't wanna hit you. I wanna marry you. I thought that's what you brought me here for. I can't do that. I'm sorry. Carmen... Car-- Damn. Your son is about to make a huge mistake. He don't usually warn no one, so I guess that's progress. You talked him out of boxing, right? [DOOR OPENS] Hey, Mama. Is someone gonna tell me what's going on? I was gonna find a better time. You're doing a porno? No, God, no. No, I'm gonna be a priest. For Halloween? No, not for fucking Halloween. For real. Oh, Stu. You can't be serious. This is your fault. You'd think I said I wanted to be a serial killer. My son don't do half measures. He's a dog with a goddamn bone. If you're so fucking enlightened, you should've seen that. Had you been awake enough to dignify his place in this world, in spite of the loss of your other son, he wouldn't be so desperate to find himself. STU: Baby, don't... I'm doing this. [♪♪♪] "To whom it may concern, "consider this application to the seminary. "Enclosed you'll find my résumé, "and half the fee. God will provide the rest cause." Cause? Oh, "'cause I'm praying for it." [CHUCKLES] 'Cause. Hey, Mama, I'm home. Hey, Stuart. I just been admiring your artwork. You invite him here? He came to check on you. You look about as holy as a healthy deuce. You had to tell him? It's a sin to lie. You ain't the Catholic here. You've had some nutty ideas before, but this is like Hitler asking to join the ADL. All these years, I was looking for the wrong father's approval. It turns out, I never needed yours. I always loved you for the piece of shit you were. That's unconditional. It's obligation. KATHLEEN: You're punishing yourself. You've both been, since Stephen died. It's not punishment, Mama, it's purpose. Let me do one last thing as your dad. -[GUN CLICKS] -Give you something you always wanted. KATHLEEN: What the fuck, Bill? You gonna disgrace me and your brother like this, you might as well bury me too. I'm turning my life around. There ain't shit you could do to stop me. Unless you wanna shoot me. Huh? Dine out on two dead kids. Oh, to hell with both of you! I trust we'll both find our way. You both better be gone when I get back. [KATHLEEN CRYING] [MUTTERS] Handle the trash.

Do you have an appointment? Yes. Take care, Jeff. All the best. Go on. [HANGS UP PHONE] Hey. You're the IOU. You know something, Father? There's a sign on the wall of my gym back home. "Hope is not a tactic." I took that one to heart. Fought for everything I earned. This ain't no different. I know what God's doing here. Seeing how I respond, I don't get my way. I got to be honest. I'd be red-assed about it. But I ain't giving up. Not on him or me. I want you to reconsider your rejection. There's nothing on your résumé or in your references that speaks to behavioral conformity with Catholic tradition. You are a pugilist with a criminal record. Look at St. Matthew, St. Augustine, St. Francis. I mean, some of the most remarkable figures in the history of the Church are reformed men. Yes, but I think what the Church needs now, more than ever, is to elevate the standard for a priest. No, the Church needs somebody who's gonna fight for God. That's me. Besides, if the Church's choices don't celebrate a person's capacity for change, then what else does it stand for? This may sound contradictory, but sometimes the best path to serving God is to step out of the way. With all due respect, monsignor, you're getting in my way. God wants me here. Priests become the financial responsibility of the Church. Now, by admitting you, we'd be agreeing to subsidize you as the face of Catholicism, something our board would be very reluctant to do. First, it's admitting you're afraid I'll succeed. If you so sure I'll flame out, Father, what you got to lose? [♪♪♪] HAM: My man. Hey. Look at you. What? The first of many inappropriate displays, I trust. Outward sign of inward grace. And a hug from the heart. Hugs are healing. Jesus hugged a cripple, that mother-hugger would walk. I need another one. [WHOOPS] Entering these gates, you surrender any personal means of purchase. We rely on our sponsors for money. You do have one of those, don't you? Don't worry about me, brother. I been getting sponsorships since I could swing. [CHUCKLES] By the time I leave, I'll have Jesus' name on my trunks. You can keep your driver's license and insurance card. They took my license, canceled my insurance. You doubted me, and I'm a step ahead. God bless you. It is my great privilege to welcome you to the stewardship of theology. You are here to learn that you will one day be a teacher. An advisor. A confessor. Indeed, a Father. Hey. Hey. Hey, I guess we're gonna be roommates. [BOTH CHUCKLE] Sixteen? Sixteen. [RINGING] They must've given me a faulty one. It's user error. And it's like 2 in the morning. I ain't going down till I get this right. [SCOFFS] There is no MVP of Consecration. Of course there is. Jesus. Hey, you wanna sleep, help a brother out. And be complicit in your ruse? Not over my dead body. I'll ring your bell, show you how that's done. You're a fraud. I found God. I ain't here for fellowship. I'm here for worship. That's a great bumper sticker. [RINGING] MONSIGNOR: "Take this, all of you, drink from it, for this is the chalice of my blood, the blood of the new and eternal covenant." STU: I been thinking. Hmm? Probably wise to keep a vice on hand. Somebody too perfect, they a target for the devil. "Better to be silent, be thought a fool, than to talk and remove all doubt." While we're bandying idioms. If Jesus wasn't afraid to look a fool, why should I be? [SCOFFS] If you seek to be Christlike, give us something worth repeating. That is the duty of a priest. One that you prove daily you're incapable of performing. HAM: Not just what he does that makes a man a priest. It's also what he doesn't do. He ain't laid you out yet. Oh, that's charming. Not yet. Watch your man. Oh, no, Stu. Oh, no, Stu! [LAUGHS] HAM: You look tired. STU: Give me a second, man. I'm out of shape. And you're Black. I thought you were an athlete. I'm gonna take five. Sub in for me. What? Let me catch my breath, man. Shit. Hey. You want in? Does it look like I want in? Trying to rise above here, man. A priest is penitent, not playful. How you think Moses lasted in the desert 40 years? He must've been in shape. Priest got to be prepared. I don't suppose Jesus appreciates your mockery. God gave us a sense of humor so we'd use it. I don't know how to play, all right? My father didn't see the point in teaching me sports. I was always gonna be a priest. It ain't never too late to learn. Not everyone is as eager to humiliate themselves as you are. Through his own son's shame was God's glory magnified. Jesus set the bar, brother. No one wants to hear the Gospel from the mouth of a gangster. Maybe that's exactly what they need. I'm coming back. GARCIA: "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only son, "so that everyone who believes in him might not perish, but might have eternal life." The Gospel of the Lord. CONGREGATION: Praise to the Lord Jesus Christ. It is a great pleasure to introduce a member of our parish family, now a seminarian, to deliver today's reflection. Hey. "Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do." That's what Jesus said on the cross. As a kid, I saw a dude in a diaper getting it worse than me with my daddy's belt when he was drunk. But I figured, I could never screw up as bad as Jesus. Whatever he did to deserve that. And as a man, I thought, "You know what? It serves him right. "Trying to lie to the world, make us think we gotta kiss his bloody feet for a pat on the head." Look, now, we've all been wronged, and we've all done some wronging. Some of us worse than others. But with them words I said up top, Jesus asked his father, God, to forgive the folks tacking him up. He ain't come to condemn the world, make us cower in shame for our sins. Uh-uh. He came to forgive us. Think about it. We ask Jesus to forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. God's forgiveness is contingent upon us forgiving others. That's the deal. It ain't easy to do. Truth is, we ain't got no power to do it ourselves. None of us, not a one. It's all God's grace. That's the man, right there. You just gotta let him in. He'll do the heavy lifting. CONGREGATION: Amen. Hey. Hey, wait up. Hey. You're out of shape. I'm out of practice chasing after you. You're spiritually blackmailing me. What? Reminding me that God forgives those who forgive others, chasing me down to demand it, all for you to make yourself feel better. It'll make you feel better too. There's nothing to forgive. We serve the same God. You seeing someone? You really are a glutton for punishment. You asked to see me, Father? Oh. Yes, yes. As a matter of fact, I did. Uh... It's come to my attention that there was a woman in your life, prior to you entering the seminary. I was wondering, are you still in contact with her? No, not really. I mean, she don't want much to do with a man she can't marry. You know how Catholic girls are. Or maybe you don't. You strike me as the kind of man for whom rejection only strengthens resolve. Oh, don't ask me where I got that notion. Do you still think about her? Of course I do. Sexuality's a gift from God. And denying it is denying something he wanted us to have. It's what you do with it that matters. Well, I appreciate your candor. Anyway, I just want you to know, I'm always here, if you need to talk, or you're struggling. Too kind, too kind. You know, it ain't a giving up, it's a giving for. Like anything, Father, it's the struggle that brings you closer to God. I ain't never shied away from no fight. Teaching priests to rat on suffering men, they're getting closer to Judas than Jesus. We both know how that story ends. Don't we?

[GULPING] Oh, my God. Oh, Stuart, I apologize for the delay. I had several specialists conferring over your lab reports. No worries, Doc. I got the feeling back. I think I'm good. Okay, look. Uh, there's no easy way to deliver this news, but um, you don't strike me as somebody who needs sugar coating. All right? You have a progressive muscle disorder. It's called inclusion body myositis. It's very rare. Symptoms are like ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease, where the muscles continue to weaken until they cease to function. Yeah, and... unfortunately, there is no cure. Well, you could've put some sugar on that shit. I'm sorry. Listen, it's very rare to see in somebody as young as you. Then I got a better chance to beat it. Yeah, well, like I said, th-there's no cure. All right, Stuart? But the rate of progression, it varies from person to person. How long? The first things to atrophy will be the quadriceps, finger flexors, foot dorsiflexors. Then, later on, the facial muscles, especially those that control eye closure, speech, and the muscles that facilitate your swallowing. The good news is that you could have as long as a year before you're going to need any assistance with basic daily activities. Like what? Like taking a shit? Patients find that preparing for a future with some home augmentations eases the transition. Take this shit out of my dick. I'm gonna send for a nurse, okay. Can't cure my disease, can't take a tube out of my dick, what can you do, Doc? I understand, Stuart, that you are angry. Oh, God. Is there anything it doesn't fuck with? Yeah. Erectile function.

Can't think nothing else. Yeah. But in case you don't, you ought to move back home. Spend what you got left doing things you enjoy. Eat your favorite food, see your friends. Hell, you might even box again. Ma. Sorry, baby. I'm just scared. Well, look at Mary. Watching her son getting whipped and nailed. She probably looked good doing it. That's a fucking fairytale, Stu. And if it ain't? This God of yours, you've given up everything for him. And what's he do? He punishes you. When God wounds us, he calls us closer to him. You couldn't get any closer. You're already in the goddamn bed with him. Couldn't you make some kind of deal? He lets you stay around, you be his bitch? Otherwise, take your business elsewhere. I'm not gay, all right?

We're not human beings having a spiritual experience, we are spiritual beings having a human one. This body don't mean nothing to God, therefore nor should it to you. Unfortunately, it's not up to me. The Church will not endorse you for ordination. At first the Church couldn't afford to subsidize me as a face of Catholicism.

You couldn't wait till tomorrow. Maybe that's God saying you ought to share your shit. Or else. Yeah, well, she's all yours now. We ain't that far. I could walk. Yeah, and I can fucking fly. Where you going? I gotta get your ass to church on time. [GRUNTS] [ENGINE HISSING] BILL: There you go. Ooh. STU: Breathing heavy already. BILL [COUGHS]: It's the bad air. STU: You gonna have a heart attack. BILL: Well, then it'll all be right. I'd die before you. STU: Yeah, you ain't that lucky. BILL: Shut up. KATHLEEN: Hi, baby. Hey, Mama. Wanna tell me what's going on here? What you mean? Dad is in a tie. He looks nice. Y'all think since I can't be a priest, I'm gonna marry her now? Y'all bless this? You're in no state to protest. You called her a housekeeper. What's wrong with housekeepers? Yeah, that's good for her. In three months, I'll be in a diaper. BILL: You're gonna need someone to clean up your shit. That's your job. I'm gonna subcontract. KATHLEEN: Oh, cut that shit out, you two. Here. Let's go. Mind your back, Bill. Okay. [♪♪♪] Our parish petitioned the diocese to ordain you as a priest. Monsignor made sure it was heard. Turns out, I had one good fight left in me. We all believe in you, brother. That's Father to you. [ELVIS'S "WHERE COULD I GO BUT TO THE LORD" PLAYING] ♪ Living below ♪ ♪ In this old sinful world ♪ ♪ Hardly a comfort ♪ ♪ Can afford ♪ ♪ Striving alone ♪ ♪ To face temptation so ♪ ♪ Now won't you tell me ♪ ♪ Where could I go But to the Lord ♪ Someone once told me I was bad advertising. Imagine that. [ALL CHUCKLE] He was a boss of mine at the supermarket. I kept coming in with a face looked more like raw meat than what I was selling. Of course at the time, I thought that man was wrong. Whole world was wrong when it came to me. Every brawl I had was beating back at a world I thought had done me wrong. Yeah. Every bruise on my face, every drop of blood I shed was proof of my war against God's injustice. I look worse now than I did then, that's for sure. Difference is... now I know my suffering's a gift from God. Now, I know it sounds like bull, but it's coming from a man in a wheelchair, so you got to entertain it. [ALL CHUCKLE] Hear me out. All our outer nature's wasting away. But our inner nature is being renewed every day. This life, no matter how long it lasts, is a momentary affliction preparing us for eternal glory. We shouldn't pray for an easy life, but the strength to endure a difficult one. Because the experience of suffering is the fullest expression of God's love. It is a chance to be closer to Christ. Now, no one suffers perfectly. For sure not me. Even Christ had his moment of despair. "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" He asked from the cross. Christ felt betrayed. You see, in that moment, he who was sinless... took on all our sins, and got judged by God. He took what we deserve, because he loves us. And that love... it could make the baddest man a believer. Because that love is a feeling like no other. To lead you all to find and feel that love... is why God is giving me the scenic route to die. And for that, I thank him every day. Amen. ALL: Amen. [♪♪♪] NURSE: Hi. How you doing, darling? Great. And who are you here to visit, sir? Father Stu. [CHUCKLES] You and everybody else in this town. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Good morning. Good one to be in sin, I suppose. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been seven days since my last confession. But no matter how many I make, these hands that touch the troubled are still themselves unclean. You having doubts? A doubt would imply that I ever wanted this responsibility. My father did. [SCOFFS] It was expected of me. I'm angry at God. For failing to make me man enough to defy the expectations of me. And I'm envious of you for having the balls to do just that. All I ever prayed for was a way out of this life. And to watch you given an out by God, and refuse it... I-I can't understand it. But I do admire it. For these and all my sins, I am sorry. I wasn't given no expectation, except to stay alive. I ain't coming too good on that. Whether by offering his son, or for watching one die, a father's just looking for love, like the rest of us. Imagine how it must've felt for Joseph... to be the less important father. In his name, you pray for penance. Goodbye, Stu. BILL: Bill Long, alcoholic. ALL: Hi, Bill. [EXHALES SHARPLY] I feel like I'm putting my dick in a woodchipper. MAN: We've all been in your shoes. Sometimes, too drunk to put 'em on. You've made the first step, admitting you can't do it alone. ALL: Amen. Yeah, well, I could've used God's help for a lot of things, but never could find him. My son said, that's because God wasn't lost. Wise-ass. [ALL CHUCKLE] Anyway, I sure as hell ain't got the road map. Um... I'm here because my son asked me to get baptized. [SIGHS] I killed every hero that boy ever had, hoping one day that hero would be me. Never gave him a single reason why it should be. [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE] I guess we're both late bloomers. [CROWD CHEERING] FATHER LONG: It's a profound experience, suffering. And the struggles of this disease helped me, and help others, to learn the way that we should have been living all along. It's taught me a little humility. It's taught me dignity, respect for others. And sometimes people like me-- there's an extreme example-- we need things like this to be able to make those changes, and decisions in our life that are gonna help us become better people, become the people that God has created us to be when he sent us to this planet. ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ That's all right That's all right ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ Since my soul's gotta seat Up in that kingdom ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ [CLAPPING IN RHYTHM] ♪ My, my mother How you're walkin' on ♪ ♪ Your feet might slip But you're soul ain't gone ♪ ♪ Since my soul's got a seat Up in that kingdom ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ Y'all help me ♪ ALL: ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ That's all right Yeah, that's all right ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ Since my soul's got a seat Up in that kingdom ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ Hush little baby Now, don't you cry ♪ ♪ You know your momma's Been born to die ♪ ♪ Since my soul's got a seat Up in that kingdom ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ Now that's all right Yeah, that's all right ♪ ♪ Yeah, that's all right ♪ ♪ It'll be all right ♪ ♪ Since my soul's got a seat Up in that kingdom ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ ♪ Since my soul's got a seat Up in that kingdom ♪ ♪ That's all right ♪ [BRETT YOUNG'S "LONG WAY HOME" PLAYING] ♪ Everybody's got a story ♪ ♪ Everybody's been hurt ♪ ♪ Everybody's got scars And broken hearts ♪ ♪ They don't deserve ♪ ♪ Everybody is a dreamer ♪ ♪ Until they wake up ♪ ♪ Everybody's made of stone ♪ ♪ Until their bones Return to dust ♪ ♪ You're never really lost If you never stop lookin' ♪ ♪ You gotta keep movin' If your heart's on fire ♪ ♪ Love is gonna find a way To find you wherever you go ♪ ♪ When the clouds get dark And you can't see nothin' ♪ ♪ Sun still shines On the other side ♪ ♪ Everybody gets to heaven On a broken road ♪ ♪ Some of us Gotta take the long way home ♪ It's all about deception.
