Now, that's an awful lot of noise coming out of there. Hey, well, it's big night for the kid. And he got the girl he wanted. - Yeah? - Yeah. After we got rid of her pa. Yeah. We can't have the kid go to jail for killing a floozy. - Hmm. - She was worthless anyway. And how about the pathetic sheriff that came along with her? Yeah, and you know what, Pa? I could have taken him face on. Well, what would've happened then? Oh, you aren't good at math, so, you know, he wouldn't have had a bride then, would he? Well, he sure got her now. And you... you know, you've been taking care of that kid since the day he was born. Now that he's got a real woman, he ain't got a clue what to do with her, so I'm thinking maybe... you know, maybe I should give him some pointers. Oh, I got a brother gonna outshine another brother. Are you kidding me? Get the ruler out. - I should. - Sure. - We got a ruler in the bedroom. - Ruling brother. I'm shining my shoes there every night. Hello. Well, speak of him, here he is. Through a doorway, won't you? A brother, a bit lit up. - Oh, no, look at you. - Gentlemen. Dear God, please help me. Come on, come on. Say, I'm looking for a woman, about yea tall, blonde, white dress, prettiest damn thing you ever seen in your life. You already lost your wife. Where do you think she is right now? What? She's doing something you have never had nor will have, except her. Getting prettied up for you. For you. Look at that pathetic face. She getting prettied... That guy is kissing wood. Oh, Jocelyn. Oh, Jocelyn, my lady. She'll never touch your lips, son. She'll never touch your lips. Silly drunk. Cheers to that. To the Callahan boys. Congratulations. All right. Thank you, Pa. Let's get you some coffee. Whoa! Whoa. Well, howdy, pilgrim. You play that thing? Sure do. Where are you heading? Meeting a friend up at the next station. Rhyker's station? Well, that's where I'm headed. Red Linstrom. Billy Tyson. Billy, good to meet you. Why don't you tie your pony up to the wagon and come on board? - I could use the company. - All right, then. - Come on. - Yeah, Billy. I saw you down in Mesilla. Uh, you were gambling with some Mexican kids, letting them win. I'm from Tennessee, myself. - You're riding the grid line? - Sometimes. Yeah, I used to do that when I was your age. Then they pinned a badge on me. I was that way for a couple of years. A young lady hog-tied me. I started a freight line, had to feed the wife and kids. What about you? Got a girl? Nope. Don't want to settle down? Mm-mm. Don't like responsibility? Nope. Yeah, I had a couple of kids like you. Always having fun. So, what are you doing at Rhyker's? Just meeting a friend at the next relay station. Well, it's good to have you aboard. Help. Please stop. Help! Whoa, whoa. - Help me! Please... - That looks like... Miss Miller and Sid Callahan. Jocelyn! Oh, sweetheart! We missed your reception. It's time to come home. Help me! - My brother's waiting for this... - Let her go. Oh, back off, son. This here is my brother's wife. Ow! Goddamn! She bit my hand! I said, let her go. Listen, sonny, she's coming back with me, all right? Let this go, Sid. Excuse me? That there is Billy Tyson. Billy Tyson? Never heard of him. Never heard of him. He'll take you down. Oh, is that right? Get on your horse and get out of here. Well, I suggest you slap leather and get the hell out of my way. Sid, you're more gurgle than guts. Now leak out of the landscape. Old man, you just mind your own business. Backing off, sonny, or what? No. You are. Ah! Dang! Now you can die... or we can talk about West Texas and the Bonneville Ranch. This ain't over. Mm-mm, not by a long shot. And I'll be seeing you, sweetheart. Find my pa. Meet us back at the ranch. Come on. Hyah. You okay? Yeah. You're okay. Ma'am, it's okay. Easy now. You're riding a dangerous trail. So are you. And I got no answers. But that lady is Jody Callahan's wife, and he's putting together his own posse. I've got you. You're gonna be okay. You know, Sid's never been treed before. Seemed like it was about time. Let's get her to the wagon. I got some blankets in the back. It's going to be dark soon, so we can set up camp in that canyon over there. It's got a spring. I'll get her some water. I'll get her some food. We'll be at Rhyker's tomorrow. Here. Callahans will be here in a couple of days. Go easy on the water. Here, get some rest. Don't worry about a thing. You'll be okay. Thought old man Callahan was with you. Nah, he left couple of hours ago to check on Jody, back at the ranch. Where's Sid? Went back home to change his clothes. What the devil happened out there? Some kid stepped in. Billy Tyson. Ain't never heard of him. Sid take him down? Hmm, there was a standoff for a bit, until Sid put his fist in that girl's face. You know, Sid got a temper, ain't he? Yeah, yeah, but I'll tell you, you ever seen a rattlesnake sunning itself, real peaceful-like, and then you throw a rock at it? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. That's Billy Tyson. Hmm. Mm-hmm. Get on with it, then. You know, it got hot. Sid went for his gun first. Billy was faster. Hell, Sid, barely has his Colt halfway out the holster before he was staring back at Billy's. Yeah. Kid could have shot him dead right there. But he waited, made him sweat. I think old Sid shit his pants. Where were you when all of this was going on? I was staring down that old man's rifle barrel. Yeah, I figured they went to that relay station over on Wild Horse Flats, Rhyker's? Well, we got Hardy hanging out over there. - You keep a watch out for. - Yeah. We'd best get back to the ranch and give our report, because Callahan is gonna want to call the shots. But I don't think he's going to want any trouble there at Rhyker's. - Let's go see the old man, then. - Let's go. Whoa! You know, that was a pretty amazing thing you did, putting your life on the line for that woman. Now we're going to Rhyker's. You're going to meet your friend there? He's not going to be there. You still coming with us? Okay. Let's go take care of her. Hey, sunshine. Time to get up. I think you need a drink. I know I do. - Here. - Thank you. Okay, that's enough. You're gonna founder. How long have you been out here? Almost a week. My horse threw me and ran off two days ago. Left me without food or water. Well, that's pretty rough. Where are you going? I have an uncle in St. Louis. Oh. We'll get you a stage at Rhyker's. Can I pay when I get to St. Louis? You don't have to worry about that. I got a load of goods here for Rhyker's. I'll get you something to wear. Here, come on down. I hope this fits. I know it's going to look good on you. Thank you. Why don't you go over there somewhere and get dressed? Billy and I will get the camp set up. Well, now that's the girl I remember. Your daddy, he was a sheriff at Three Wells. You used to hang around the office. Here, have some coffee. It might be cold, but it... it'll be wet. - Thank you. - So you married a Callahan, eh? They're a pretty rough bunch. I heard they came up from Texas in a hurry. Jody said they had some problems with the rangers over their brand. So they ended up selling their ranch and moving up here with their herd. Jody's a lot younger than his brothers, so they give him anything he wants. Guess that includes me. I heard there were seven brothers. There were. Three of them died in the war, and two were shot down in Texas after the war. Squatters, Jody said. West Texas? I don't know. My mother died a few years ago. And then a couple of months back, my father was shot down in the middle of the night. I was so lonely, and Jody was so sweet. A week ago, we got married at the church. The reception was that night at Callahan's ranch. Everyone was drinking too much. Oh, no. Well, speak of him, here he is. - Gentlemen. - He needs pointers. We'll drink to that. Join the club. My dress was so hot, and I was so tired, and it was loud and crowded, and I couldn't breathe. I stepped outside alone for a breath of fresh air. - Don't y'all think it's noisy in there? - Yeah. I could hear the voices, but they couldn't see me. Well, it's big night for the kid. And he got the girl that he wanted. After we got rid of her pa. It was Sid and Mr. Callahan... talking about how my father was killed so Jody could marry me. Something about stopping him from arresting Jody from murder. Can't have the kid go to jail for killing a floozy, though, can you? "A floozy," they said. She was pathetic, that girl. I stayed out of sight and was too afraid to go back inside. You can have them arrested and hanged. I think they said it was Sid who shot my father, but no one will believe me. It's my word against the Callahans', and they'll just deny everything. But it's the truth! I know it! I took a saddled horse with a canteen and bedroll, and I just rode away. Where would you go? North, to the stage road, but I got lost somewhere in the hills. Ended up on foot with no food or water. I'm sure they know we're heading to Rhyker's. Now I've got the two of you in trouble. Don't worry. We'll be safe at Rhyker's. He's a good man, a tough man. And his wife is a Mescalero Apache. She's tough. She won't let anything happen to you. Thank you. And thank you for my dress. It'll always be my favorite. You were the brave one. He's a kid. They're not too smart. Is he blaming me for what happened? Not at all. He's got his own misery, whatever it is. He wanted to kill Sid so bad, his hand was turning white. When Sid hit you in the face, that was just too much for Billy. It was more than that. He looked like a left-handed guy. I'm grateful, all the same. Well, you're never going back to the Callahans. You're with us now. Honey, we got a stage coming. Hold! This is an outrage. You were for sure in the lead when they were handing out tongues, Mr. Potts. Ma'am. Hey, Joe, we've got a real problem. - I mean, a real problem. - How's that? Well, we were going down there to old Holy Grail. I hit some rocks and broke that rear axle support, tore up the undercarriage. I mean, we're not going to make it to the next stop. We're going to have to fix it now. Well, then maybe he shouldn't have been going so fast. Well, Mr. Potts, if I wasn't such a good hand with my lines, we'd be at the bottom of that mountain, in a heap. That fresh team from the last station could have hardly hold them back. Looks like we're going to have to put you folks up for a while. You'll get your luggage soon as we get it down. And I suppose you expect us to carry them? Yeah. This could never happen in Boston. Joe, this is going to take a couple of more days. Well, northbound ain't due for another week. Give Chauncy some time to work on it. Yeah, Chauncy? - Yes, sir, boss. - All right. What's the squaw doing here? Oh, that's my wife, Nellie. She's the cook, so you'd better watch your mouth. Unless, of course, you want to end up with a real bellyache. And I'm expecting he's going to carry our luggage for us. No, he's a customer, just like you. We'll get your luggage, sir. Go on inside. ...because he'll talk all night long. Ho! Ho! Hey, Joe. - Hey. - This is Miss Miller. - Ma'am. - That the southbound stage? Yeah, it's busted. You got my goods? Yes, sir. Chauncy will help me unload. - You bring my apples? - Yes, sir, I did. All right! Don't worry about the wagon. He'll take care of your team. That is, if you're staying a while? Oh, we're staying. When's the northbound due? Oh, about a week. They cut back on their runs, even though I told them the Mescaleros never come out this far. Would you help her down? Sure. Ma'am. There you go. And that's my friend, Billy Tyson. Howdy. You hungry? They are. Well, let's get on in there and get a meal. Let me take your horse, son. I'll put him away. Thank you. All right. That's right. Who's that? Customer. Name's Hardy. He's waiting on some friends. Figures. Don't turn your back on him. You know something I don't? I'll tell you later. Right now, she needs some freshening up. - You got any luggage, ma'am? - No, sir. All right, let's get you on inside. - There you are. - Thank you. Who's that pretty young thing in there? We picked her up a while ago. Sid Callahan was trying to grab her. The kid stepped in and made him cow down. You're telling me that kid is faster than Sid Callahan? Hands down. The way I look at it, Sid had to run home and change his clothes. But I got to get rid of that girl. I'm gonna take her north in my wagon. They'll just track you down. And you'd be all by your lonesome. You'd be safer here, Red. What about the kid? He ain't afraid of nothing... except that girl. As for the Callahans, he's got a heat in him that's gonna boil over. How much time we got? I saw that Hardy ride off. He don't matter. They already know where she is. All right, let's get some grub. Come on in. Think we got this almost ready. Okay. You ready to put this on? - Here we go. - Okay. All right. I wish I drank more coffee this morning. Well, that Nellie, she sure is a good cook. I thought they could keep me safe, provide... - Thank you. - Thank you, Miss Nellie. And then when I heard Sid and Mr. Callahan talking that night... - Let's see if your boys will eat. - Sure. You boys hungry? Hey, boys, there's a rider coming. I've been sent to make a way for Jody to see his wife. What for? He wants her back. Well, she believes the Callahans murdered her father. Why the hell would she want to see him? Well, he figures she owes him an explanation. He had no idea why she left, what she knows. All right. We'll bring her on the porch, but Billy and I will be with her. And that's all. No one's going to touch her. Not ever. Billy, you got to know. The Callahans are planning to hang you for shaming Sid. Figured as much. All right. Friend of yours? He's the only gun I could ever turn my back on. Sounds like you don't trust anyone. No, sir. All right, let's load up. Honey. Honey. Why don't you go outside, get some fresh air and take a walk? It'll help. - What's going on? - Ain't nothing you need to worry about. If there's gonna be trouble, that's something that we... You'll be on the southbound stage this afternoon, so mind your business and eat your meal. Don't talk down to me, mister. I own half of Boston. Then maybe you ought to go back there. I don't like your attitude. I'm just saying, if you don't like it out West, go home. - I'm gonna report you to the company. - Be my guest. There's something going on. Yeah, well, whatever it is, you're not helping one bit. You. Who are you to judge a man like me? You're a woman. Where's my pa and brother? They'll be along tomorrow. How many men they got over there, Hardy? This old man works there, Rhyker and his Apache wife. The freighter, two passengers, Billy and the girl. And the stagecoach driver. But it's pretty wide open all around there. Twigs is right. The only cover is the high ground behind the house. There's a shed. I think we can get some men in the gullies around the place as well. There's a spring one canyon over. We can camp there tonight, get a closer look in the morning. I say we camp three men at the south, three to the north. You and the rest come with us. Yeah. Okay, now it's pretty wide open. You can find a spot, right? Keep them from leaving? Yeah. We'll figure out a plan. Wiley, let's go. I wore my best new hat for her. Oh, well, she ran out on you. Yeah, it's all that talk she heard. Yeah, all true. But don't forget, you were the one who beat up that floozy down at Mimi's, - left her dead. - She laughed at me. Yeah, I know. She also lived long enough to tell the sheriff, and that's why Sid bushwhacked him. And your blushing bride knows all about it. Now what she does is, she cuts the apples real thin. And then she takes them and she soaks them in whiskey. That's the secret. - Sounds pretty good. - Yeah. You're gonna have some pie. You're gonna love it. It's delicious. One of the reasons why... - We got company, boys. - Yeah. Honey! Whoa, whoa. Honey, you in there? Honey. Oh, my God! Yeah, that's far enough. You stay right there. Now, look, I don't want no trouble. - All right. - All right? I just want to talk to my wife. I got a right. Honey... Honey, what in the world did you run off in the middle of the night for? You know what you did. She heard your brother say that you killed a woman. What? And her father was going to arrest you, and they had him shot down. But there ain't no truth to any of it. That's why you run off? Over a bunch of damn tall tales? Oh, come on, honey. - Just... Just come with me. - I'm not coming with you. She's going to have the marriage annulled. What, is that what you want? What, just like... Just like that? No! Let me tell you something right now. You don't come with me right now, a whole lot of innocent folks are going to die. - Meaning? - You know who I am? My pa and brother could have 30 men around this station by morning. We'll be here. You want to die in this rat trap? All for keeping a man from his wife! That's my wife! You save a whole lot of lives you come with me right now. I'm not coming with you! I'm gonna get you back either way. You're mine! Tyson, boy. You ain't nothing. You're a slug. You got lucky with old Sid. We'll see how you come out in the morning... when we string you up. Unless y'all want to turn tail. We'll be here. Shit. It's on you, honey. It's on you! He means it, Billy. - Well, they don't have a lot of cover. - No. There's a gully back there. Then those mountains go straight up. We'd better be prepared. What are you thinking? I'm thinking we could use a drink. Me too. Let's go. Remember to watch the crossing at Cibecue Creek. Chauncy, is that the last one? - Last one? - That's the last one. All right. Sir. - Ma'am. - Thank you. Team! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Good riddance. You got any dynamite? Yeah, buried behind the barn. But they were already sweating, so they could be real dangerous. You know dynamite? What's there to know? When it's wet, it's nitro. Well, if it's wet, Red, we won't touch it. I seen it done. All right, let's go see about it. Where are they going? Off to get some dynamite. They could get hurt. Here, come on, let's sit down. Rest a bit. You really like Billy, don't you? He looked like he was going to kill Sid and was upset he didn't. Why is he like that? Before I got hitched, I was a lawman for a long time. I saw a lot of men with a lot more than you could share. Billy's just like that. This is a rough country. It builds hard men. You don't have to worry at all about Billy. Ho! Put your weapons down! Who the hell do you think you are? You can't stop the U.S. mail! Let me tell you something, Mr. Mailman. Until someone delivers me my lawful wedded bride, nobody's getting in or out. Your wife's back at the station. We have no business with you. Stand aside! I know my rights. Let us pass! Get back inside! Let us go. We're not hurting anyone. Now, gentlemen... Ma'am. The Callahan boys always get what's ours. Now, whether or not you want to be bleeding out in the dirt here... well, I guess that's up to you. We're going through! You shot him, you son of a bitch! Turn around. Hyah! Now head directly back to Rhyker's! You ever blown anything with these before? Once. What are they doing? Well, that's not good. Whoa! What happened? That Jody Callahan and that customer of yours, they ambushed us looking for that girl. In fact, they're not going to let anybody leave until they get the girl back. I say, give her to them. We're not going to give her to them. Yeah... No, we're not. I'm sorry about this, ma'am. Why don't you go on inside? Nellie will fix you something up nice. Sorry. This is not good. I don't know. You think they'll hit us all at once? Not right off. They'll probably cause enough trouble to bring her out, but... I don't think they'll do any more killing. Too many witnesses. Well, I hope your plan works. Let's go. All right, listen up. Now as soon as my pa and the men get here... Well, we... We know what most of them likely to do. Except... What about Tyson? What do you think, Twigs? Well, I don't know much. He never seems to work for anyone. But he's the fastest gunner I ever seen. You go face on, he'll take you down. He let Sid walk away. Maybe he had his reasons. But ain't nobody going to beat him to the draw. Then we'll take him out any way we can. How's that getting my wife back? We're counting on the passengers to throw her out. Don't worry, kid. You'll have your wedding night and your honeymoon. I don't like this, Red. It's bad for business. You better tell Chauncy to be careful. - They'd love to find a hostage. - Yeah, I already told him. Those passengers, they're gonna be trouble. Uh-huh, I know. We should always look at that draw. They might come down there. Maybe they're arranging to get to the fence line. Let's go in for some coffee. We'd better fortify this place. We can build some cover out front, board up the windows. Do y'all like Boston? It's quite lovely. Keep your eyes on your own cards, please. Mr. Potts, you could be more of a gentleman. We don't have all night. Don't rush me, Mr. Potts. Two pair, kings over eights. Straight flush. - I fold. - Of course you do. Will y'all excuse me? Of course, honey. You go right ahead. If people are killed, that'll be my fault. My own father was killed by Jody's family. I still feel so much guilt. Your father was killed because Jody killed a woman, and your pa was going to arrest him for it. I still feel awful. Nothing's your fault. Except being too pretty for your own good. You know, you ought to go back inside. They could probably get their hands on you out here. Not with you here. Well, I'm just one man. More like 20. Mr. Linstrom said your pa was a good sheriff. Yeah, he was. Didn't like Jody much. But you did? When my father died, I was alone, and... But you're here now. I'd better go inside before I say something foolish. And before I forget you're a married woman. I'm not married. Not like that. He never... You know what I mean. Billy. You got to a lot of learning to do when it comes to women. You almost done there, Chauncy? Yes, sir. All right, follow me. Tell you what, after you feed the stock, leave the gate open. There's plenty of graze and feed out there. Well, if we do, they'll just kinda drift away and disappear. Yeah, but I don't... don't figure they'll go further than the creek. That way, we won't lose you so easy. Lose me? I feel like an old fence post, I'm kind of permanent around here. Let's hope so. You ought to get some breakfast. I was just figuring why we're here. You know, like knights of old and chivalry. Chivalry? Doing the right thing, protecting women. And getting killed. You scared? No, sir. You're here. Hope she has some bacon on. Thank you. Thanks, Miss Nellie. This is incredible. And no one seems to be worried. And that squaw over there seems like she's ready to knife us. No. No, Mr. Potts. It's you she's watching all the time. I think she's admiring your hair. Make a great scalp to go over her stove. Why are you even here? I mean, if you hate it so much, why are you even... Listen, I've told you, I'm my own salesman. Own my own clothing company. Make good money at it. Looking to expand. Looking for opportunity. Well, I'm selling some beef cattle. You interested? Not a chance. Besides, I don't work with ranchers or farmers. You have a wife? Kids back home, Mr. Potts? Absolutely not. Wives spend too much money. And they're always wanting something. Besides, when you're gone, they spend every last penny you worked hard to get. Nope. No wife, no kids. How about you? Yeah, we do. Four boys and a girl. Well, ain't you a peach. That Mr. Potts would sell me off if he could. Don't worry. Anyone talks bad to you, I'll put salt in their pie. - You're really very nice. - Only to people I like. How long you been married? Five years. Uh, and no children. A lot of men wanted me. I did not like them. How did you end up with Mr. Rhyker? Joe was trading with my brother. When he saw me, he wanted me. So Joe brought horses. My brother said, "Not enough." It went on for a long time. My brother was just playing with Joe. Finally, he said yes. You speak so well. Did you go to school? No. Joe taught me. And how to do numbers, and to read. But we have no children. Joe wants children, but he doesn't think it can happen. He might be surprised. I think he will be. When are you going to tell him? Soon. Congratulations. That's so exciting. You're going to be a great mother. Thank you. Hal, a couple of horses came off the hitch rack, and they're looking for new grass. Oh, criminy! I got a bad feeling. No, they're not here yet. They'll wait for nightfall and come down that hill. We just don't have enough men to cover that gully. What's Mintz doing? A couple of horses got loose and he went to gather them up. Take the shot, Wiley. Mintz, get back here, now! Damn it, what the hell was that? Warning shot. Hurry up! They're shooting! Take cover! That's a warning shot. Let's go! Poor Mintz. He was a family man. We can't let this go on. What the hell's going on? Wiley's getting soft, or can't see for nothing. Jesus Christ. And you know who you can count on to finish this. I just... I don't... I don't feel right about this. Like what are we...? What are we waiting for? Your pa sent word. We was to wait for him and your brother. Yeah. We'll get her back, Jody, and then we're going to hang that little bastard. I think now's the time. Yeah, just lay down a barrage. Hit the stick near that cabin on the ridge. What kind of man keeps another man from his... his woman? Yeah, you definitely got some unfinished business, - but we have to talk about this later. - Yeah. Jocelyn! Catch, Dylan, go after him now! Jocelyn! What was that? I think I'm concussed. Christ! - Pa! - What are y'all doing in here? Go on out there. Go up on the ridge. They took over all the ridge. Come on. Come on. You don't hide in a house, for Christ's sake! We're in a war! - Grab that for me. - Sure thing. Well, that's enough of that stuff. Good thing you got a hard head. - You all right, kid? - Yeah, I'll be fine. Did that hurt? Oh, man. We got to find a way to turn this around and get the advantage here. That's right. But we got to turn it around, so it's fair for us. - That's right. - And they lose. Yeah. That's big artillery they're using. I got an idea, Pa. How about we send Twig to make a deal? - That's a good idea. - Thank you. I could end up a hostage. Please, don't whine about every goddamn thing. You're bright, you're smart. You'll work your way out of it. Go get it done, son. - Get down. - What's going on? If you're not gonna fight, just stay quiet and get down. You can watch the back window, at least. What happened? The driver tried to get away on horse, but they shot him. So we blew up some dynamite up on that ridge. Well, did you kill them? Not likely. Well, they're gonna want to kill all of you. They don't want no witnesses. They're after the girl, Potts, so just sit down and shut up. Well, all I got's this derringer. You know what? Come nightfall, you can sneak out on foot. Sneak? You give me something to shoot with. You know how to shoot? My grandpa Ines and my uncle Alfred taught me how to take care of myself. - You give me that gun. - Here you go. I don't want to be a target. It's up to you guys to do all the fighting. - I'll cover the back. - All right. Don't you worry about him, little girl. It's them out there who got to be worried if we turn him loose. Just stay down. Billy. They're giving you one more chance. Yeah? They want to get blasted some more? You send that girl out and come along so they can hang you, or they're going to shoot this place full of holes. How many are out there? Well... we got men to the north blocking the road. Another group to the south. The Callahans, Hardy, and six more guns. How about that buffalo hunter? Wiley, he's out back behind the station, but I don't know how long he's going to hold out. He's got a big appetite. Why are you here? Well... I wasn't sure... till now. You coming over? Yup. You know you'll be the first one they hang. Why should we trust you? Me and Billy, we go way back. And we got plans. What do you think, Billy? We go way back. What now? Sure could use a decent cup of coffee. Well, if Billy can trust you... you're all right with me. I'd like to have a word with Twigs. I reckon we ought to make this look good. Then you'd better take me prisoner. You notice Sid didn't flinch when you brought up the Bonneville Ranch, but he'll start thinking about it sooner or later. We know they done it. What in the hell? What is Twigs up to? What's he doing? He's trying to make the peace, Pa. Well, he knows we want the girl, right? - And Billy Tyson. - And Billy Tyson. You know, if he don't come out soon, though... Is he still talking? Damn it. I want my wife. Yeah, we know. Just relax. Question is, does she want you? She's just scared, that's all. All those raids, they had their faces covered, but... there was a dead horse with the Callahan brand, and a rifle with the same brand on the stock. When you wrote for me to meet you here... I was hoping you might've found out who'd done it. I was with him long enough, but didn't learn anything for sure. But... the smell is there. I hear Rhyker's wife's a damn good cook. Is she gonna feed me or knife me? Don't be in such a hurry now. Come on, let's go in. I'll speak out for you. He's okay. Yeah, Twigs sure went in easy. Maybe he's in there still talking. Bet the passengers are going to have something to say about that, - I'll tell you that. - Hmm. And maybe they'll send Twigs out with the girl. You know, maybe I ought to just go back in there and give it another try. No, son. It's too late for that. No, look, I sweet-talked her once before. - It's too late for that. Hear me. - Yeah. We may have to hit them with everything we got. Now, come on, I don't want my wife getting hurt. She's not gonna. You can't go down there! You can't go down there! I'll tell you one thing I don't get about this whole thing. Billy Tyson. How is he in the mix in the first place? Well, the girl bit me. She drew blood, so I hit her. - She bit you? That was it? - Mm-hmm. Well, he also brought up West Texas. You were young, but we hit about 12 places in West Texas. But none of them was Tyson. He brought up Bonneville Ranch. Yeah. I lost two brothers there to shotguns. They put up a fight. Squatters. They really put up a fight. When we left there, there was no one left, and we burned the place to the ground. So how the hell could Billy Tyson know anything about that? I don't know, Pa. Maybe he's kin or something. Well, kin don't matter. He's got no proof. No, he doesn't, but I don't think he needs it. What is going on here? Twigs is a friend. And what about when your back is turned? If he's a friend of yours, we sure as hell can't trust you. - Mr. Potts. - What? I suggest you take a seat and stop being such a... such a Yankee carpetbagger. I'm just trying to stay alive. I suggest all of you do the same. Well, any friend of Billy's is a friend of mine. Thank you, Chauncy. Do you mind taking watch? I speak American, old man. Old man, is it? Ah... I could smell that beefsteak cooking a mile away. How are you doing, Twigs? - Which side are you on now, Wiley? - You know him? Yeah, he's okay. I'm on her side... with them beefsteak. Got a feeling you might be showing up here sooner or later. Well, I got hungry. This here is Billy Tyson. - Good to meet you, son. - Any more out there? - Who's this? - This is Wiley. Twigs says he's okay. I saw about six of them sneaking into your barn. But other than that, no. All right. I'm Jed Wiley. This is incredible. Huh. Hello, ladies. I've seen your tracks out there quite a bit. But you didn't tell them? You sure are trusting, Billy. Well, anything Twigs says, I trust it with my life. And why is that? He's my cousin. Keep that under your hat for now. I figure they must've pulled in some more guns. Probably ten hard cases over there with the Callahans and Hardy. - But I know how we can lower the odds. - And how's that? Me and Billy, we clean out that barn. There's not a lot of cover out there. We have to move fast. We could take Wiley with us, but he might slow us down. Well, that might be so. I bet I got a bullet to outrace all of you. Listen, men, whatever you're planning, I'm in. Miss Perimeter, you could get hurt. I'm a much better shot than you think I am. All right, ma'am. We got it covered, but Potts here has to fight. Now we got Wiley, Rhyker, me, Chauncy... and this fine sharpshooting lady. And Jocelyn? Well, her daddy was a sheriff. I figure she knows how to handle a gun. So does Nellie. Good. Now let's get to work. Twigs turned on us. Yeah, and Wiley too. I saw him go in that back window, and there weren't any shots fired. Well, it don't matter. He's just an old turd. He lost it a long time ago. He's no matter. Now what do we do? Take a couple of men, take them up there on the road, and put them where Wiley was. And then at sunup, we're going to give them everything we have. Look, we don't know where the rest of that dynamite is. Well, it doesn't matter. They can't see it in the nighttime, and we're gonna hit them before daylight. All right, I've been patient... but, Pa, I don't want my wife getting hurt. Shut up! This is not the time to bring that up here. She's responsible for this whole goddamn mess. Well, I want her cute like I married her, not all mangled up like you fixing to do. It ain't about your wedding. It's about us not dying in a clan fight. Come on, boys, I dug this tunnel. It'll get you to the barn. All right, here you go. It's a long way, boys, but you'll get there. Billy? Please be careful. You scare him half to death. I hope I get to know him better. Someday. He didn't tell us it was a crawl space. Well, at least he was kind enough to leave some lanterns down here. I think I see the end. We should probably kill the light. They're all around us. Just take out as many as we can and get the hell out of here. - Well, better get to it. - After you, Billy boy. - Anything? - Nothing. Jocelyn, you see anything? Wait, hold on. What if it's not them? Right. Didn't think we'd see you two again. Well, welcome back. You all right? Well, now that was something. You should've seen her. She got real concerned, trying to go after you in the hole. Wiley had to pick her up, carry her out. She was screaming like a stuck pig. She's sweet on you. Well, we got five down. Still got all the Callahans, Hardy. Probably six more guns over there. Well, what now? What do you think, Billy? Well, we've still got two more sticks of dynamite out there on the ridge, and a Southern sniper in here. It'd be a waste to use them now. All right. Let's hunker down until they come back. Nellie's got some hot coffee. You want some apple pie? Come on. They hit us hard. The ones who weren't killed ran away. So they're all gone? What? Just like that? They got lucky, that's all. So wait, you're telling me we got nobody out there right now? - No, sir. - Well, it doesn't matter, because in the morning, we're going to hit them with a barrage that's going to wipe that place out, every window, and the front bay, and everything else. Kill every goddamn one of them. Can't you just call some more men? They were just a bunch of clowns anyway. You don't have time for more men! We're here because of one reason. We're all risking our lives in a clan war for your almost-bride. Get those guys back. Pay them double, if you have to. Get a gun and kill someone. Yes, sir. Mr. Potts, are you in? Um... Sorry. Billy, you and Twigs should get some rest. I'll take first watch. They'll hit us hard at daybreak. All right, Chauncy. It's time. - All right. - Let's go. Wake up, wake up. Wake up, wake up. There's danger. Come. Go, go, go, go. Hey, Rhyker. Rhyker, take over. Got to reload. Careful, don't hit her. Oh, for God's sake, shut up! - Do you see her? - I don't see her. - What you shooting at? - Shut up! Damn it, Sid, don't you hit my wife! - Shut up, man. - She's lying on the floor. You seen her hit the floor, right? Nah, if she's standing up, she's got five bullet holes in her head. What? No! Don't you hit her! - You see those cans shining? - Yeah. That's where we hid the dynamite. - Shoot for them. - Yeah, I see it. Ah! Son of a... Hey, Jody. Jody. Jody! Oh, shit. Jody! Jody, Pa! Jody ain't breathing. Jody! Jody! Pa, are you all right? You all right? Go kill every goddamn one of them! All right, all right, I will. Leave no one alive. Oh! You don't look too good, Blair. Oh! Right after the war, you were raiding all the small ranches outside West Texas. We needed the grass. One of them was the Bonneville Ranch. You killed my pa and his ranch hands. So what? You pistol-whipped a boy. Threw him in a well. - Yeah? - But I wasn't dead. Twigs here came and pulled me up out of that well. That was you? Then you dragged my mother behind the house. That was Hardy! That was Hardy! You're going to shoot at a dead man? That was Hardy. Where is he? Well, wherever he is, he's running away, trust me. So I was the... I was leading them. And I shot. And he went down. Tumbled like a steer. He went down like a steer. Bye. You take care, young lady. Ma'am. - You were wonderful. - You too. Ma'am, such a pleasure. Bye-bye. All right... - Stage is leaving, boys. - I'll miss you. Hyah! Hyah, team! And it's done. Nothing's changed. Nothing at all. Sure, it has. Nellie's got some hot apple pie. Who wants in? Is that what it's come to? - Apple pie? - That's about it, son. It's all about hot apple pie. And I can already taste it, gentlemen. Wiley gets there first, there won't be any left for us. Don't worry, Nellie always hides a piece for me. - Best wife a man ever had. - And every man should think that. That's why my wife is the best. She sent the apples. That she did. Oh, Red... Well, it's all over, Billy. Oregon's waiting for us. Well, now we can have some peace and quiet. - Not for long. - No, Nellie. It's over and done. Back to the same old routine. Not anymore. You're going to be a daddy. What? I said, you're going to be a daddy. - What? - Before snow falls. Oh, what? Boys, I'm gonna be a daddy! Come on! Billy! Billy, I made a baby! Whoo! Everybody! You can get on back inside, now. I will not. What's next for you, Billy? Oregon. Twigs and I are getting a spot. Is that his real name? No, it's Jess Bonneville. And yours? Billy Tyson Bonneville. Jocelyn Bonneville. I like it. Whoa, whoa. I... I didn't ask you. - You can't just... - You save a girl's life, you have to marry her. Now, you... You get back on in there now. Never.
