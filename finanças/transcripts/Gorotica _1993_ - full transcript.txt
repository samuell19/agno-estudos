- You're on Race and Reason. - Fuck you, Nazi. Okay. Hold on, man. Fuck! Come on! I don't know what went wrong! You cut the wrong wire, man. That’s what went wrong. I could've sworn it was the red one! That’s what my cousin told me. Fuck your cousin, man. The place is crawling with cops, let’s get out of here! Man, we’ve got protection. Ah, fucking shit. Makes me feel a lot better. All right, I got another idea. The main point of this burglary was for this piece. Yeah, so? - The rest of this shit’s just bonus, right? - Yeah. Cops can’t take us in without any evidence. Let’s dump the rest of that shit and just take this with us. So now we can walk down the street like nothing happened. Tomorrow, I'll have to take a serious shit. We’ll be back in business. Okay. Let’s get out of here. Police officer! Freeze! Put your hands up. You too, pal. Put ‘em up real slow. Max! Hey, pal. Let me help you out. - Oh, thanks, buddy. - Is this your car? Yeah…yeah. That I…just got it today. - You just got it today? - Yeah. An…a Buick. Well, thanks. I’ll be seeing you. Ooookay. Drive careful! Be good. Nice car. Bye! Bye! Be careful. What a nice guy. Get me the fuck out of here! And on the seventh day…he rose from the dead. “One job,” you said, you know? One job! Why did I ever let you talk me into this? I mean, who cares if we’d have stayed a no-name band and hit town? I mean, how many bands go to California to make it big? I mean… We’d have probably died in California anyway. How in the fuck, man, are you gonna play drums with a bullet in you? Well, you’re the answer man, say something! Say something! Hey there. Hi. I’m not interrupting something, am I? No, my friend just had a…just had a few, he’s, uh…sleeping it off. Yeah…he’s really out of it, all right. Well, we gotta get going. Okay? Look, I don’t think your friend here is gonna wake up. I think I can help you. Death is a funny thing, but nobody’s ever laughing. Although, where do we put him? Take him in the bathroom. We’ll put him in the tub. Uh…look, I don’t have any money or anything. So…I don’t know what you want… Wait. Sorry, pal. I may have some money. A lot of money. Oh, wait a minute. It probably wouldn’t be a good idea for me to call from here. So, uh…I wanna step out, okay? I’ll be back. I swear. I’ll take care of your friend. Mmmm…you’re so fresh. I’ve never had one this fresh before. He'll pay a good price for you. But I think I’ll keep you to myself for a little while. When you’re born into this world, you’re so helpless. Completely defenseless to what they may wish to do. It’s the same when you die. I’ll be gentle. Hello? Ah…yes, I’ll accept the charges. Max? You sound different. Why in the hell are you calling me here? It’s not Max, it’s Neil. You know, uh…we were working together? Getting the piece you were talking about? I know exactly what you’re talking about. I’m very disappointed in the way you’ve handled this. The person I represent is no longer interested in purchasing the item. Entirely too much has happened. Look, you don’t know the half of it. I’m willing to negotiate. I…I just need some money to travel. I’ll see what I can do. Call me tomorrow at one. I trust the item is safe? Yeah, it’s safe. No one’s gonna touch it. Love affairs never last. They deteriorate…they decay… They fall to pieces. See, we’re not so different. You just can’t complain about it. I do not call it a mistake. A mendacity. I call it sin. I have sinned against you, my Lord. And I would ask that your precious blood… …would wash and cleanse… …every stain. Hey. Looks like he’s trapped. Just like Jeff was when he blew him away. Look! I found a gun. Man, that’s not my gun! - At your feet. - You’ve got the wrong person! Motherfucking cop killer. Come on, blow me away! That’s not my gun! Guys, you’ve got the wrong guy! Calling me stupid? Tell Jeff’s wife tonight that her husband was blown away by a two-bit punk! - I’m gonna go back tonight, and tell her… - Shit! Ah! - …that we blew you away! - Stop it! Ah! So you better take this gun… You’re gonna take this gun, and you’re gonna shoot it, and my partner is gonna shoot you! Simple, ain’t it? Now bite the fuckin’ bullet. I’m not gonna…kill anybody! Fuck you! Kill the police. Kill the pigs. Hate, hate, hate. Fuck! At one point, maybe I could’ve stopped this, but now it’s a fuckin’ snowball! It can’t stop! What’s going on, and what’s he doing? He’s not doing anything. He’s dead, remember? Well, why is he lying there? I thought we were gonna cut him up, not cut his hair. It’s all right, I’m cleaning him up. He is starting to get stiff. At least the good parts are. Jesus. Ahhhh…god damn. Tomorrow, one o’clock… …if I can keep my fucking sanity until then… …I am getting the hell out of here. My daddy died when I was seven. The funeral was so beautiful. All those flowers, and that beautiful casket. Everyone showed up to pay their final respects. I didn’t understand. My father had always been such a tyrant. Always yelling, always mad. And now, he seemed so peaceful. My mother told me to go and kiss him goodbye. I couldn’t understand why. But he seemed so nice. That was the first time I actually felt love towards my father. I wanted to be with him. Tomorrow, I’ll go and introduce you to someone. You may not like it—I sure don’t. But, you’re starting to smell and he knows how to prevent that. And I have to pay the rent. Sad. You even get fucked when you’re dead. Are you in there? I wanna be cremated! Hello. Yes, I’ll pay. Neil? Well, do we have a deal? 25,000. 25,000? It was originally 250,000! No one wants to handle the item after what you and Max have done. The only reason I’m able to get rid of it is because my client has a collection, and he needs that piece to complete it. We’re lucky to get that. Ahh…okay, I don’t care anymore. What do I do now? You need to meet me in Buffalo. My client will be taking the item directly across the Canadian border. Buffalo? Do you know that’s a 20-hour drive from here? Look, I’ll reserve a room for you. You want to call this off, we’ll call it off. Or do you want the directions? All right, okay, fine. I just want to get this over with. Blake. Yeah, I got a fresh one. Just died yesterday. Blood, not embalming fluid. Look, this one’s gonna cost you a little more. Okay. I’ll have him there in about an hour. What’s going on? Shit! You scared me. I scared you, that’s a good one. What are you doing? I’m getting rid of the body. What, are we through playing with it? Look, don’t help me anymore. I’ll handle it from here. What are you doing with the knife? I’m going to cut him up and dispose of him, it’s easier that way. Look, why don’t you let me handle this? I know where we can get rid of him in one piece. This guy will make sure he’s never seen again. Look, he’s my friend, and I say we cut him up. Now get the fuck out of my way! I’m sure you’ll see it my way when you wake up. You won’t have a choice. Look, why don’t you let me handle this? I know where we can get rid of him in one piece. This guy will make sure he’s never seen again. You are right. This one is better than the others. I should be able to preserve him longer than the rest. I think I’m in love. I think I’m gonna be sick if I don’t get some money. Sick… I used to be admired by the men. It was considered an honor to bed down with Blake Lords. And I will continue to be in demand. I don’t want to be in jail for giving some unsuspecting fool this dreaded disease. I’ve read that people have been put in jail for having sex in my condition. Death is a small price to pay to bed down with a Lord. I would think you’d like to go to jail. That’s where all the real studs are, aren’t they? Yes, for a healthy young man. They wouldn’t touch me. They’d treat me like…like… Like you have AIDS? Touché. So…do you want the extra money? Blake, you’re a real pain. We go through this every time. I admit the friends you bring are nice, but… they show little emotion. I need…a touch. A…human touch. Or I’ll go fucking crazy. All right. Just let loose of me. The stuff’s in the back bedroom. I know where it is. Prepare yourself, I’m in a nasty mood. Yes! By now, we were supposed to be out on the beach, living the good life. Instead, I’m chasing my dead friend around the city. “Friend.” I don’t even like that fucker anymore. Hey, I can take you to Memphis. You’re dying of AIDS, you’re fucking dead people, and you want me to beat you every time I come around. Most people would be on their deathbeds crying. Dying would be the easy way out. Don’t worry. All right. You’re not in hell. You’re still in God's sight. God damn, this gets better all the time! I thought I’d lived a full life. I seem to have missed so much! You’ve been walking around in a daze. Most people walk away from trouble. You just keep following it around. You must want to join your friend in heavenly bliss. If this is heaven, I want to live forever! Hey, buddy. Don’t do anything else, and I won’t blow your head off. Now, I know you don’t want any trouble with the police, so I’ll trust you to walk out of here, not say a word, and not come back. - Blow his fucking head off. - All right! I made good my grand. He’s mine now! I can’t take any more of this. Look, I hope you two are very happy together. All right? I hope it was worth it. I mean, I was disposing of your friend. I was taking all the chances. All you had to do was walk away. Now look at you. A prime candidate for AIDS! What are you talking about? He had AIDS, you idiot. I sold him dead people to fuck! He wasn’t satisfied with blow-up dolls. He liked the real thing. He’d preserve them as long as he could and then I’d sell him another one. You’ve got open sores on your face. Shit, you’ve got his blood in your mouth! You’re the walking dead! Looks like you’ll be joining your friend after all. We may need company. All right, pal. Time to take a serious shit. All right. Your carrier had some guts. They fuck you when you’re dead, and they fuck you when you’re alive. Come in. Are we comfortable? What is that smell? Jesus! Smells like the Old Spice ship wrecked with a tanker. I haven’t been feeling well. Do you have the money? I ran into a few problems. But I can get you 5,000 easy enough. For some reason, I knew you were gonna say something like that. Got a light? Look, I know it’s not much. That diamond is really hot. It is very hard to get rid of. You know, they fuck you when you’re dead, and they fuck you when you’re alive. So when I die, I want to be cremated. Yes. So do I. That’s good. The flowers smelled so sweet. Sweeter than peppermint candy. Then Red Riding Hood heard a gruff voice say, ”Yes, they certainly are beautiful flowers.” She turned and saw the big greedy wolf of the forest, standing on top of a rock. Red Riding Hood had never seen a wolf before, so she was not afraid. God created boys and girls able to have children by about the age of twelve years of age. Think of that.
