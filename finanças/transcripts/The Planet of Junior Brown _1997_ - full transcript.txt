(machinery ticking) (mysterious piano music) - Spare some change, ma'am? Merry Christmas, thank you very much. Spare some change, sir? Spare some change, ma'am? (mysterious music) (machinery ticking) - Junior? Junior? Junior? (mysterious music) Come and help your mother with her medicines! ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm ♪ And all is bright ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child ♪ Holy infant ♪ So tender ♪ So mild ♪ Sleep - Check it out. One hallowed evening, a 10th planet materialized in the night sky, lit up everything, just like that. How come no one else saw it? I guess you gotta be in the right sphere. But now, this misunderstood brother, he saw it, he jumped up and down, pointing up to the sky, trying to get people to take notice. But you know Homo sapiens. People just walked on by. I didn't see what this misunderstood brother was seeing at first, but I found if you look hard enough, real hard, you might just see. The closer we get to the year of our Lord, 2K, the more people are peepin' on this 10th planet. Crazy? Maybe. It feels like a world spinning, like some celestial religion, all because this one young brother, who incidentally is like a prophet, he is like a prophet, in exile from humanity. And when I inquired as to his name, he replied Junior Brown. (laughs) Behold, the Planet of Junior Brown. (laughing) - Junior Brown. (chuckles) But you still didn't tell how come it didn't cause disasters for the other planets. - Man, how come you always gotta spoil shit, huh? You know how long me and Mr. Pool worked on this thing? - Yeah. - [Junior] How come? - Asteroids, alright? Happy now? - Where? - Where? There's 30 asteroids balancing the orbit. - Where? I don't see no 30 asteroids. - Yeah, and you don't see any moon around the Earth either, do you? - Yeah, I meant to ask you about that too. And that Sun you made? I mean, it's too small. I mean, if the real Sun were that size, we'd all be frozen to death, and there'd be no plants, or insects, or nothing. - Have you ever tried to fit a 10th planet into a nine planet solar system? Yeah, I didn't think so. It's a lot harder than it looks, only Mr. Pool, me, and God know how to do that shit. - Yeah. - I just didn't see no 30 asteroids, that's all. - Yeah, well, use your imagination, man. I had enough trouble stealing the motor to run this whole thing. (captivating jazz music) - [Junior] Hey, I see them! - Yeah, nice. - Asteroids. (laughs) 30. (laughs) (captivating jazz music) (Junior laughs) - Yes, that's right, Junior Brown. A whole mess of them. Alright, that's it for today. Come on. School's out. Be careful on your way out, alright? Don't let nobody see you on your way out. See you on Monday. (bell rings) (mysterious music) - [Kid] Hey look, it's Free Willy! - [Other Kid] Yo, Fat Albert! Hey, Oprah, how's the snacks? (laughing) (wind chimes rustling) - [Mr. Pool] A 10th planet materialized in the night sky, lit up just like that. I found if you look hard enough, real hard, you just might see it. - Man, what are you looking at? (somber piano music) - Yo, let's go in. Derrick says come on. Maybe they're sure that Tanaka's not there. (somber piano music) (clapping) - [Derrick] Come on in, it's cool, the man's not here. How you guys doing? - Man, Junior was fretting himself all the way over here. Thinking today was the day you sold the baby grand. - Oh yeah? Well, Mr. and Mrs. RSP over there are certainly thinking it over, but they're not gonna buy shit. So you don't worry about it, Junior, okay? - She was playing Chopin like it was Mozart. She got the style all wrong. - Hey, you know, I would let you play it, but you know, Tanaka. - Yeah. You know, Chopin has more silences between the notes. - Yeah, he does. You're right. You know, nobody buys pianos anymore, Junior? You know, soon they're gonna be extinct. - I got one at home like Fats Waller had, but this one, it's best for classical. - This one, this one's gotta be played by somebody with something to give. - Derrick. What did I tell you about letting these kids in the store? - Well, I didn't see any harm in it, sir. - [Buddy] We were just leaving anyway. Come on, Junior. (slow classical violin music) - You know, I can tell you like that girl, J. But you gotta, you know, talk before you touch, man. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna hook you up. I'm gonna hook you up, Junior Brown. Let's go, you're gonna be late for your piano lesson with Miss Peebs. (slow classical violin music) (car honks) Yo, Junior! - Hey, stupid! Hey! Where are-- - Man, who you calling stupid? - Get out! - Who you calling monkey ass? You can't see him walking here? You don't see you just got hit by a car, almost? Huh? What are you, stupid? (Junior hums) Yo man. You know what I was thinking? I was thinking, maybe I'll come with you to Miss Peebs, check out your lesson. So, what do you think? - How many times I gotta tell you? Miss Peebs don't like nobody coming up to my lesson but me. And what do you always gotta follow me around for anyhow? - Man, one time I won't be around, and you're gonna get your assed kicked, man. You know what I should do? I should let you travel to the other side of town by yourself, see how you like that. - I'd like it just fine. Maybe then I'd get some peace in my brains. (Junior hums) - Alright, man. I'll meet you back down here in like an hour and a half. - [Junior] Yeah, okay. - You want me to go in the lobby with you? - No. Say, Buddy, I'm gonna ask Miss Peebs if you can come up to my lesson next Friday, so you can hear me play if you want. - Alright, cool. - Alright. (woman sobs) (man laughs) (woman sobs) (knocking) - [Miss Peebs] You can't have your lesson today, Junior! - Let me in, Miss Peebs. - [Miss Peebs] Junior, your instruction has been canceled. Now, I will talk to your mother about reimbursement. - But I have some new music from the library, a new piece of Prokofiev. (woman sobs) (ominous music) Miss Peebs? - [Miss Peebs] Why can't you leave me be? - Miss Peebs? Miss Peebs? (knocking) - Oh, honestly, Junior. You're like a dog sometimes. Come on. Now. Which Prokofiev did you select? - [Woman] And what about her? That squeegee kid. - [Man] Nah. Nah, she's too young, too green. Let's go see if the blonde is still at her usual spot. Get the money ready. - [Woman] Cold enough for you? - Is it cold enough for me? Yes, it is. Can you make it stop now? My lips are falling off my face. - [Man] (laughs) Maybe someone should downsize old man winter, huh? - Yeah, maybe. So, what are you guys up to tonight? - [Woman] Oh, we're just out for a drive. - [Man] Driving around. - [Woman] And maybe this can help. Santa said put this in your hand. Take it. - [Man] It's no big deal, take it. ♪ It's like butter, baby ♪ It's like butter ♪ It's like butter, baby - [Man] Yo, see you later, kid. - Yeah, thanks. How come you're always spying on people, Buddy? Huh? Who the hell are you, 007 street kid? - Who were those people? - [Butter] They're friends. - Friends, huh? You gotta watch the company you keep. Listen. Why don't I come check you later? Let you know if we can hang out on my planet. - Going back up to your planet so you can feel me up like some undersexed teenager? No way. - I just want to hang with you, that's all. I thought we could, you know, catch Jerry Springer. - You don't have a TV, Buddy. You don't even got electricity, you can't see to read a TV guide in your shit. - Candles. I got enough candles. - Yo, Killer! Wam youth, come here man. Come here, I'm on patrol man, looking for this rat named Sweetpea, you see him? - Nah, man. - Ay yo, you see Sweetpea? - What'd he do? - Yo, man. Communicate with officers of the law, man. You know what I'm saying? Gave them some intelligence about one of our planets. You didn't you hear about it? Where you been, man? Yo, man. Babylon shot it up last night, and now we have what, refugees on the street? Know what I'm saying? Just the season, right? - Yeah, man. - Sha. Hey, Butter. - [Butter] Mhm? - Let me borrow Killer for a little bit. - I thought you liked blue. - Come on, man. (fly buzzes) - I'm sure you haven't forgotten, Junior. - Yes, ma'am. - You do remember I had to destroy the piano. - Oh, that's not a problem. I could sit right here-- - And beat out your lessons on the table. Very good, Junior, very good. But first, I want you to have some tea, and then I am going to get you some fresh baked Christmas cookies. - Yes, ma'am. Thank you. Miss Peebs? - What is it, Junior? - Maybe you'd like to tell what really happened to the piano? - Be sure and wipe your fingers, I don't want any grease on my mahogany. (loud buzzing) - You see the streets? It's like an undiscovered country, man. Nobody knows we're here. Am I right? Alright. So, listen. You gotta remember one thing. Now, a refugee comes to you for help, you do what? - Help. - Ah, see it there? Help, right? Now, look. Somebody did that for me, and who did it for you? - You. - Whoa, see? - You schooled me good, Duckie. - I school it right. I got something to teach you yet, Buddy Clark. (finger tapping) - Oh, the third sonata. (fast paced piano music) - Ay, yo. We got a rat at 12 o'clock. - Oh. The game is afoot! Yo, look over there, look, look! (fast paced piano music) (Miss Peebs hums) - Now, remember. Prokofiev, not Chopin, and... (intense music) - Certain rules to the streets, son. You just broke rule one. In South Africa, they put a tire around the offender's neck, and put gasoline in it, and burn him a new necklace. Sounds reasonable, right? Now, listen. Babylon threaten to hang you by your nipple ring on a meat hook. You tell them what? - Nothing. - Nothing. But that's not what you did. You tell them somethin'! Buddy. Come here. You know something about fire, don't you? Light this bitch. Light him. - Please, Duckie. Don't do this. - Please, Duckie. Go, light him, light him. - [Sweetpea] Don't do this, please! - [Duckie] Light him! - [Sweetpea] Don't do this! (baby cries) - Hold on. He looks like a weenie roast. (laughing) Alright. I tell you what we're gonna do, alright? You're the wilderness for 40 days and 40 nights, right? No contact at all. When you repent, come back to the fold, all is forgiving in the world. See? - That's cool. Thank you, Duckie. - Alright, alright with you? Alright. Cool. Beat this piece of shit. Oh, dat hurt! (fast paced piano music) (groaning) (fast paced piano music) (groaning) - I want to play a real piano. - I have told you so many times, Junior. You can't play the piano. You were doing just fine. So few students become concert pianists, only one in a thousand. - I mainly want to learn the theory and composition. - Then you won't have to practice on my piano, will you? That is a concert piano for concert pianists! I didn't mean that, Junior. - Miss Peebs, do you have some more cookies in the oven? Because I think I smell something burning. - Oh my God. As a matter of fact, Junior, I have a relative visiting with me at the moment. He's been here for several weeks. And I don't know what to do. - I could get my pops to help. - Shh. You aren't to tell your father or anyone else about this. - Okay, I won't. - He's not well. He's not well. I thought that I could nurse him back to health, but I don't have what I need here. And he's stubborn! I mean, filthy and stubborn. You can see for yourself. And if there's one thing I can't stand, it is an intrusion. What gave him the right to-- - Miss Peebs, I can help you. - No. I think it's best that you go. I don't want you cutting yourself and getting an infection, I am in no position to be sued. - All I need is a sponge or something. - Shh. He's hiding again. - No. No, no, no, no. I think he went out before I came in. - You don't know him, do you? - No. Ah! (loud clang) God damn you! You filthy beast! Oh. You will not get the best of me! I will pulverize you! Look! Look! - I think you got him, Miss Peebs. You got him. - I think you better go now. I'll give you a proper lesson on Friday. It'll all be settled then. - Okay, okay, okay. But I'm bringing my friend Buddy. - Junior, I've told you-- - Or I'm not coming. - Fine. Fine, but hurry, hurry! (baby cries) (woman laughs) - Hm. I spoke to Miss Peebs today, she says you could come up with me next Friday to my lesson. She's got someone staying with her. - Miss Peebs? She got a man? - He's a man. But he's a relative. Like, this relative tried to break a piano, or maybe make Miss Peebs do it. Yeah, he made Miss Peebs do it. He was so dirty and nasty. Stank up the whole hallway. I think he like, busted his finger when he was trying to break the piano, and he just shuffles around scaring people. - Did he scare you, Junior? Let's get you out of here. (somber piano music) (melancholic music) (mechanical ticking) Hey, how come there's no strings in your piano? - It gets on my mom's nerves, so she asked my dad to cut them out. - So, where's pops? - Well, he was here, right? But he had to go away, like on some business, you know, but he says if he can get away, he'll be here on Saturday. If he can get away. (somber piano music) - Junior? Junior? What are you doing? Come on in here and get yourself clean. Junior? None of your foolishness, Junior. - Sorry. - You have to learn something about sacrifice, Junior Brown. You can't get through this life without sacrifice. (water splashes) ♪ Oh, holy night - What time is dad coming? - He said he'd be by in time for breakfast. - Who's gonna make me breakfast? You or him? - I'll make breakfast for all of us. - Is he gonna stay all day? - That's what he said when I called him. - You'll see, you'll see! (chuckles) He'll stay all day. We'll go to the piano store, and we'll go have pizza, and he'll stay all day with us, we'll have fun. (chuckling) - Aw. Come on. (choral singing) (loud commotion) - Do you guys know someone we can stay with for the night? - [Kid With Glasses] We just heard about you, man. We heard you were cool. - So Buddy, we can stay with you? - Stay here? Nah. (somber choral music) - Yo. Welcome among the infidels, Killer. What up, youth? - Look, I'm on a hit and run, Duckie. I want to leave these two immigrants with you. - What's wrong with your planet? What, no fire insurance or what? - Man, I got no room. - Bullshit. - You gonna take them or not? Been to two planets already. There's no room at any of them. You're the only one left. - There's a natural order to things seen. The older ones teach the younger ones. Been like that since, for eternity. You know something? I thought I taught you everything, but it looks like one or two things don't catch yet. Refugee! What's your name? - I'm Lesley, this is my brother Doug. - Alright, look. I'll go and provide economic asylum for the youths, seen? - Look. Don't come back to my planet, alright? Duckie's gonna school you. - But I wanna stay-- - Nah, I'm out. Alright, peace, Duckie. - Yeah. (catchy music) (phone rings) - Hello? Hi, Junior was wondering what time you were... Oh. He can't get away. He tried. No, no, no, I understand. Right, right. I'll tell him. He's not coming, son. Breakfast is on the table. Get yourself dressed, we'll go out, we'll enjoy the day. - What'd you make? - Something special. I'll go down and get the laundry. Go sit. (whimsical piano music) - Does that make you happy? - I don't know. - Then why do you persist? - I can't help it, I can't help it, I like to eat, alright? I'm sorry, Mom. We can go to the piano store, we don't have to wait on Dad. I mean, he can come with us next time. (chuckles) - Next time. Next time, you'll know what his promises are worth. Yes. We'll go to the piano shop, and then we'll go to the record store. Junior, if you're as talented as everyone says you are, you'll manage. And then we can take in a matinee, I hear there's a great film downtown. And then we can window shop, just the two of us. (calming music) - I came to take you away from all of this. - Really? Unless you're Tupac reborn, you ain't got no place to take me. - Maybe. Listen, you like Schwarzenegger movies? He has this new one where him and that little dude play two elves who save Christmas. Thought maybe we could catch a matinee. - Are you paying for the popcorn? - With extra Butter, baby. - Dinner afterwards? - I have the coupons right here. Look, I'm just kidding. You can choose the place. - Okay! (melancholic piano music) - My mother's buying sheet music from Derrick. - I have an idea. Why don't we go to my office, and we can talk about the service we offer with the piano. - He always wants me to play for customers. That's why he makes me stay here all day long. Apparently, he's having trouble selling things one, but I think he's got it sold this time. I've seen you play before. You are the best piano player I've ever seen. You are Junior Brown. - Yeah, Junior Brown. - Too bad my father won't let you play it. No one is allowed except me, and it always has to be Chopin. I know I don't play as well as you, but most of them don't really care anyways. - No, you play it okay. It's just a little like Mozart, you have to let it breathe. It's sort of like crying, I mean, I don't know if you cry but-- - I know what you mean. - I have the new sheet music, we can go. - Okay. - Say goodbye to your friend. - Bye. - Nice to meet you, Junior. - Nice to meet you. - Bye. Bye. - See, I told you. No one's better than Arnold blowing away them grinches. (laughs) Merry Christmas, asshole. So, why don't you take off your coat and stay a while? - Where did you get all this stuff anyway? - Five finger discount. Why? It's your first winter of discontent? - Yeah. How come you're always wearing long sleeves? Is it true you're all burned? Are you a good thief, Buddy Clark? - I only steal what I need. - Well, what's your next caper? - Your heart. I'm gonna steal your heart. - You want to steal my heart? You want to steal my heart, huh? Well, that's gonna be really hard. - Why? - You see, cause first of all, you've got to tear all the skin off my chest, you gotta rip the muscles apart, you have to shift the lungs over to one side after you've broken open my ribs. Only then could you get at my heart. You think you could do that? - Yeah. Take good care of it too. Keep it in a little jar over there beside my bed, so I could, you know, it'll be the first thing I wake up and see. - Right, you would too. You sick bastard! - Nah, really. You can trust me with it. - I don't trust you. You're a man. Men have dicks, I don't trust dicks, okay? They're always trying to get into your mouth, or wherever. - You trust mine. - Bullshit. You have a dick between these legs, Buddy Clark? Look at that, there it is. Oh, it's already getting hard too, well I better get out of here before you do something stupid and try and stick it some place. (somber music) Let me go that easy, huh? Aren't you gonna sit there? You're not gonna try and force me? Knock me down? Rape me? What's wrong with you, you sick bastard? You think I can trust you? You say you can pull my heart out of my chest, huh? Would you keep it? (somber music) - Okay, alright, check it out. Now, the universe is the same everywhere in all directions. Our solar system's average, nothing special, boring as solar systems go. Now, the planet of Junior Brown is no different than any other planet, only bigger. Space, matter, time, energy, gravitation, cannot, my fellow Earthlings, be measured alone, but only in relation to other elements, you understand what I'm saying? You are late for class. - Sorry, my-- - Now, nevermind the excuses, just have a seat, I'm almost done here. Everything dies, all Earthly things. Including your precious little planet, Junior Brown. That means no more shopping trips to the mall, that means no more bungee jumping, that means no more quests for perfect abs. All that shit dies. And if you think that there's a possibility of travel to another galaxy, you got another thing coming. Because even at the speed of light, Andromeda, our nearest galactic neighbors, two million years away. And the youngest star in the Milky Way? Well, when our youngest star here in the fabulous Milky Way is extinguished, so too are we. God damn it. Must be in the tracks. - So, you have a nice weekend with your pops, man? - Yeah, that's got it. God damn it! - He buy you something else you don't even need? - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Go easy on him, Buddy. - Whatever. - Yeah, well, he came on Saturday. - Yeah? - Yeah. But my mom made a big breakfast for all of us, right? And I had scrambled eggs, and you know, and toast, and bacon, and my mom had like yogurt, and wheat germ, and grapefruit juice. My pops just had toast and coffee like he always does. Then we went to like, this recital and... ♪ Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes ♪ ♪ Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes ♪ ♪ Silver white winters that melt into springs ♪ ♪ These are a few of my favorite things ♪ ♪ When the dog - And then afterwards we went to the movies, and my dad stayed all day man, yeah.

I got a surprise for you. - Surprise! - So, any of you guys want a beverage or something? Snacks, you know? - Buddy? Can I talk to you in the other room please? - Yeah. No, wait here, Junior. I'll be back in a minute, aight? - Yeah. - I told my father I was gonna see a movie with my friends. I have to be back by 9:30 though. - Buddy goes to the movies all the time. - I go with my mom sometimes, my dad never comes. But sometimes he takes me to... Taco Place. I'm fat. - I know. Is Buddy there your best friend? - Yeah. Yeah, he's my best friend. He's all alone in the world, not like me and my moms, you know, cause he lost his family in a fire when he was a kid, right? That's why he has like these scars on his arms, but I never look at them because, you know, he's never ever once called me fat, and I mean, Mr. Pool said that people say he started the fire, but I don't think he did because he never told me, and he would've, right? Because he's my best friend.

So, why did you run this morning? - I didn't run, Buddy. I left, okay? - Listen, why don't you come check me later? - No. - Why don't you just come back to the planet? - No, Buddy. Okay, yeah, whatever. I'll see you later. - See you later, aight? - Okay. (somber music) Excuse me, could you please spare some change? - Merciful Father, thank you for the food you provide, we nourish and sanctify our bodies in your holy name. Amen. - Amen. - [Buddy] Amen. - Junior. You may pass the sweet potatoes, and the gravy. Buddy Clark, begin by passing the broccoli please. I expect you like turkey wings? The bony part? - No thanks. - Which do you prefer? - I don't eat meat. - I'll have what he doesn't want. - Junior. I expect you're some sort of black Muslim? - I'm not Muslim, I just don't enjoy eating flesh, that's all. - Nonsense. Fowl is not flesh, it's meat meant to be eaten. We have plenty of meat here, please feel free to help yourself. - I'd appreciate some water if you have any. - Goodness. Of course. I didn't think, since Junior seldom has any with his dinner. Excuse me. - I hate water. (chuckles) - Here you go. - Thank you. - Welcome. Junior? - Junior and I were thinking of maybe going to see a movie. I'll have him home safe if that's a problem. - Oh, what is the matter with me? I forgot the salad. - I'll have some salad, Mom. - Yes. Excuse me. Junior! - Damn it, Mom! Buddy, come and help me. Hold her, hold her! (groaning) - Damn, your mom's a junky, man? - Diabetic. - What's in the needle? - Glycogen. She didn't watch her sugar today. Hold on, hold her head up! Sorry, Momma. I'm sorry. (groaning) (mysterious music) Hey, don't forget. You promised to come to Miss Peebs with me on Friday, to my piano lesson. I mean, you promised. - Alight, I'll be there. Tell your moms I said thanks for dinner, and I'm sorry she got sick. - Yeah. - Aight? - Alright. (siren blares) (calming choral music) - [Woman] Cold one tonight, ain't it? - Yeah. I've seen colder though. - [Woman] You shouldn't be out here. Why don't you come back with us for a while? It's warm. Just for tonight? - [Man] Just for tonight. No pressure. (calming choral music) (moaning) (somber piano music) (moaning) - Junior. Junior, I'm going to go mad listening to this racket over and over again. David, will you do something about this God damn racket? (somber piano music) - [David] I gotta get going. We gotta leave early, take the kids to see the in-laws. Now, tell Junior I'll try and come around and see him before Christmas. - Why don't you stay and tell him yourself? - [David] Here, I got these for you and Junior. Don't open them before Christmas. (somber piano music) - Did you get her the same thing in a different color like last year? (somber piano music) - [David] I'll see you soon. - He said that you shouldn't open it before Christmas, and that he'd try to come by and visit before Christmas, if he could get away. Get up. - I gotta go. I'm gonna be late. Buddy's waiting for me outside. - But you haven't finished your breakfast. - I'm not really hungry. Buddy said to thank you for dinner last night, and he's sorry you got sick and everything. - I'm just sorry he had to see me in that state. - Oh, it's not your fault, Mom. I gotta go. - Junior, give me a hug. - Bye. - When our youngest star here in the fabulous Milky Way, is extinguished, so too are we. (wondrous music) - [Man] Bingo! Now who gave you this stuff? - I didn't do nothing, let me go! - Who was it? Who was it? - Buddy! - Don't make me sit in the class today, Buddy! I can't sit in the class today. - You two! With me now, let's go. Let's go. Now who's that kid outside? Obviously you guys know each other. - What kid? - What's your name, son? - Just tell him your name. - Junior. - He's Junior Brown. I'm Glenroy Clark. - Junior, does your mother pronounce her name Junella or Juneela? - Sir, you really don't have to call Junior's mom. She's sick, she's a diabetic. - Glenroy, I'm gonna ask you to step outside for a minute, please. - Buddy. - [Buddy] Sir, you really don't have to call. - Outside! - I want to go with you, Buddy. - You can handle this, alright? Look, I'll be right outside. Don't worry about it, alright? - I can't stay in here with him. - You can handle it. Don't worry, I'll be right out there, okay? Okay? - Okay. - Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown. This is Carl Roundtree, calling from your son's high school. It appears that Junior hasn't been to class in just over two months, and I'm wondering if you're aware of this. Please give me a call at your earliest convenience. Thank you. (heavy breathing) - Joyce. Is Mr. Roundtree there? He wants to see me. - Oh, he's just finishing up. I think he'll be right with you. - Come on, Buddy, come on back in. Ah, Mr. Pool, I'm glad you're here. Give me a couple of minutes, I'll be right with you. - So, did he ask you anything about Mr. Pool? - No. - [Mr. Pool] Fellas. - Yeah, we're here. - So, what did Mr. Roundtree want? - He wanted to know why me and Junior weren't in class all the time. I told him some story. But he called Junior's mom. - Uh oh. - [Buddy] So, what did he ask you? - He wanted to know how come he could never find me when a toilet needed cleaning. Can you believe that? I asked him, under my breath, what are you doing snooping around the boys room? Well. Looks like I'm gonna have to dismantle the whole rig. - You know this is the last time we could ever come down here. - Yeah. - Junior? You're to wash the dishes this evening after dinner, Junior. I will call you when it's ready. - Yo, what are you doing here? You making this a habit? - They took her, Buddy. - Took who? What are you talking about, man? - Lesley, she's gone. Duckie took her. - You stay here, alright? Yo man, you seen Duckie? - [Kid] No. - Alright. Butter. So, you ever think about going home? - Home? - I don't know. - No. I miss my bed, though. You know? I had the best bed. When I was really little, I used to wake up every morning and, I don't know, I'd go downstairs, and crawl under the kitchen table, and eat sugar right out of the bowl. This one time my dad was there... (chuckles) You know what a hard on looks like when you're five years old? It's as big as your arm. I just went back up to bed and... No. I'm not going home. I miss my bed, though. - Look, I'm sorry. - Junior? Junior? I'm going to go crazy if I keep hearing this racket over and over again. (loud creaking) Junior, I want you to know that I'll no longer be subsidizing your drawing. You've shown yourself to be irresponsible with what you choose to commit to paper. I will not have those pictures in my house. I don't care what you see on the street, or what your friend Buddy Clark might put into your head. I won't tolerate that kind of filth, do you understand me? (mysterious music) Junior! (groaning) Junior! (coughing) (groaning) Junior! Junior. Get momma's medicine. Junior. Junior. Oh, hurry, baby. Hurry. Oh, Junior. Junior. - I'm going to a movie. It's downtown, okay? - Junior, don't leave your mommy. (sobbing) Don't leave me! Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. (sobbing) (dramatic music) - Yo man, you seen Duckie? - I think you should like, locs it. Yo. What happen? Buddy? Hey ya'll, make some room, seen. Our good pal Buddy Glenroy Killer Clark is here. Yo, come here man. Yo, man. Everywhere I go, people telling me, yo, Buddy's looking for you, man. Buddy's looking for me. Yo, I said to myself, yo, why? The bitch must want more favors, right? You didn't hear man? Three strikes, you're out. Seen? - Hi, Lesley. - You know something, man? Me and Les, man, we were just chilling. You know what I'm saying? - Lesley. Why don't you come stay with me now, at my planet. Come on, your brother's waiting for you there. Let's go, I changed my mind, Les. - Les is so young, man. She doesn't even know the first Cosby Show, you know the original Cosby Show? Oh, shit. I'm sorry, man. That's right, your sister was about her age, right? Refugee comes to you for help, what do you do? Come on, don't disappoint me Buddy, what do you do, come on. - Help. - You help! - Lessons learned, Duckie. You schooled me good, man. Come on, Lesley, let's go. Let's go, Lesley. - Yo, pass is pass. Right, my brother? You know what I'm saying, Killer? You don't mind if I still call you Killer, right? Alright. Yo, man. I'm just here, you know, celebrating the birth of what's his name. (chuckles) - Alright, Merry Christmas, Duckie. - There's always room at the Inn. Always room. - [Derrick] This ain't a good time, Junior. You gotta go. - Where's the piano? It's gone. He sold it? He sold the piano? - Yeah, listen. You gotta get out of here, okay? - He sold the piano, where's Sandra? - Look, Sandra's not here, but you really gotta go. Okay, Junior? You gotta get outta here. Listen, I'll talk to later, okay? Go on. I'll talk to you later. (knocking) (ominous music) (knocking) (phone rings) - Hello? No, I haven't see him, he's not here. Fine. If he comes by, and I doubt that he will, I will certainly call you and let you know. Certainly. Goodbye. (fast paced piano music) (knocking) Don't get it, Junior. - But it's Buddy, though. I thought you weren't coming. - [Buddy] Sorry, Junior. I'm here now. - Come on in. - Hi, I'm Buddy Clark. - Let's just go in. - He's here, Junior. - I know. - Can you feel him? (classical piano music) This is the first piece you mastered. Remember? You played it over, and over, and over, and over-- - Again. I'm going to go mad if I keep hearing this racket over, and over again. - Oh, you thought it was so difficult. It was easy. (classical piano music) - David, will you do something about this God damn racket! (emotional piano music) ♪ Silent night ♪ Holy night (strings plucking) - Why can't you help me just a little bit, Junior? Why can't you learn to sacrifice? - Why can't you help me, Junior? Why can't you help me? ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child - No, no! No, no! (Junior screams) He's in there, Buddy. He's in there. ♪ Sleep in - Can your friend help us? - What? What is it? ♪ Sleep ♪ In heavenly peace ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ Sleep ♪ In heavenly ♪ Peace - Well, I went with him over to Miss Peebs house, and she started to play, and he got more scared than I ever seen him. - So, what happened? - They had this spot covered up on the rug. Her and Junior were about to die over it. He had to see what it was, and when he did, he almost fell apart. All it was was a dead rat, I saw it for myself, it was just a dead rat. - Alright, okay, Buddy. We just need to get us a plan, we need to get him some help, we need to just take him to the hospital. - [Buddy] No. We can't take him to the hospital. - [Mr. Pool] I don't want to hurt Junior, but he needs some professional help. - [Buddy] He's not hurting anybody. - [Mr. Pool] He might hurt himself. - No. I'm not taking him to the hospital. They'll take one good look at him, and they'll never let him out. They won't let him out. - Just listen to me, Buddy. We gotta get Junior some help. - Hey, remember when I told you my dad came that Saturday morning and stayed all day? - Yeah. - He never did come. - I know, man. Junior, remember that fire when I was a kid? (laughing) - I know. I know. (somber music) - Damn. (lighthearted music) So, this is your planet, huh? (lighthearted music) - Junior. - [Junior] Huh? - Junior. - [Junior] Huh? - Wake up. Wake up, man. I got a surprise for you. - What kind of surprise? - [Buddy] Don't worry about it, let's go. - Surprise! If Chopin's gonna be played, it oughta be played by someone who knows how. - Look, I know it's a little early, but Merry Christmas, Junior Brown. Well go ahead, Junior. I still haven't really heard you play. (somber classical piano music) (mysterious music)
