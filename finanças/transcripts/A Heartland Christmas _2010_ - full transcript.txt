23.976 English SDH DVD Subrip NTSC ? 29.11.2019 (snorting) (neighing) (rumbling) (neighing) (neighing wildly) (soft music) - The left. (indistinct chatter) - Left rein! Left! - I'm pulling left! - Other left! We're gonna end up in a ditch. - Got it. Here we go. (laughter) - Remind me to check my email for RSVPs to the Christmas Eve open house. Oh, and did you tell Caleb I need him to get all of the outside lights out of the shed? - He already did and he put them up. - Without me? Great. Cowboy decorating. Can't wait to see that. - So who's coming to this open house thing? - Some of Amy's clients and a whole bunch of potential new customers. There's gonna be sleigh rides, hot apple cider in the barn, ice skating. - You are so transparent. - Excuse me? - Oh, come on. Christmas is less than a week away, Peter's in Estevan with his sick dad, and you, you're keeping crazy busy trying to escape reality. End of story. - That is not it at all, okay? I made the open house plans before the whole Peter situation. Mallory, can you be careful? You're carrying precious cargo. - Whatever. - When do your parents get back from Halifax again? - The day before Christmas Eve, right after my dad's last concert, but hopefully they can get a flight in earlier. - Yeah, hopefully. - Nice. So that's the thanks I get for being your indentured servant. - Cry me a river, Mallory. You've been a pampered houseguest all week. (Mallory scoffing) - So? - So? - So what did you get me for Christmas? - Like I'd tell you. - Come on, just give me a hint. - No way. What'd you get me? (grunting) (panting) - Maybe I didn't get you anything. - Well, maybe I didn't get you anything either. - You are so-- - I can't tell you. - It's a secret! - Please, Ty, I just dragged a tree with you. - Do you think you coulda got something a little smaller? Something that would maybe fit through the front door? - What are talkin' about? She's perfect. - Yeah... Took your sweet time gettin' it. Phone's been ringin'. - Well, Scott's forwarded his vet calls to me. - He's away on holidays. - Well, I let it go to message. - All right, well, I better check it out. - Jesus! Could use your help here. (Amy laughing) - Come on, Grandpa, you can do it. - You see this one? It was my great-grandmother's. And every year they go on the tree in the exact same order and the exact same place. - Same place, same order? - It's a Bartlett tradition. - Sounds fun. - Come on, Amy, lift your end. Don't let it drag. - Looks a little small, don't you think? It's gotta touch the ceiling. As long as it's gonna touch the ceiling. - I personally guarantee it'll touch the ceiling. - If we can get it through the door. - I can't get it through the door. It's stuck. - No, you have to pull it in the other way. - Let me try. - Okay. Ashley! Ah! (Ashley laughing) - You all right? - Yeah. - Okay, other way. - Okay, a little to the left. (Amy and Jack grunting) - Yeah? - No, no, back into the corner, back into the corner, I think. There you go. Um, can we spin it around? I wouldn't mind seeing what the other side is like. (phone ringing) Maybe it's... maybe it's fuller on the other side? No? Hello? Peter, hey! Shh... One sec. Hey, how are things? - Lou. - Well, how's your dad? Tsk. Really? Well, when are you coming home? - Lou. - I miss you... - Lou! - Aw... it's so nice! Our first tree together. Our first Christmas. So... do you know what you're getting me? Something special to remember this Christmas would be nice. - Ash, I really don't want anything. We both know we don't have a lot of money. I mean... Heck, we don't have any money. - Well, I've got a way to buy a few little things. - No. You're not using your mom's credit card. - It's just not happening. - Why not? She won't even notice. - And she's in Florida. - Yeah, well, that's not the point. It's just not right. So... let's make a pact. Since neither of us can afford to get each other something, let's do without gifts this year. - I guess. Okay. - You're all I want for Christmas. (both): Whoa. (laughter) (voice mail): To delete this message, press-- - I'm calling from Pike River. This mountain pass got cut off by a snow slide and some horses got trapped. - You'd not believe Lou and this tree. - They're starving to death. Someone's gotta get them out before it's too late. They're north of Pike River, in Claw Valley, just below the falls. I thought someone like a vet should know. I hope you get this message. (beep) - I'm gonna call Scott. - No. You can't go anywhere right now. Look, me and you were gonna build grandma Lindy's gingerbread house. I already baked the pieces and Ty promised to clear the pond for the skating rink. Which reminds me... Grandpa? - I will decorate the barn and the cabins at the dude ranch. I know, I know. - Thank you. Do you really think I can pull off an open house all on my own? - Well, you thought it up all on your own. - We all agreed we were gonna do a traditional family Christmas this year. - Okay, we still can. I'll help you build the gingerbread house when I get back. - Mallory, you can't just throw them on, okay? It's not where that one goes. - Please... - Lou, I don't know how you can be thinking about decorations and open houses when there's horses out there starving to death. - I need you to help me here. - Grandpa... - Look, Pike River is way off the beaten track and you might have trouble with the roads. - Okay, there's no room for discussion here. I just talked to Scott and he needs me to check it out. So I'm going. - I checked the avalanche reports. There's no warnings right now. So conditions are stable in that area. - Good. Thanks. - Make sure that you can come back in daylight. Don't go driving those icy back roads in the dark. - Jack, I'll try. - You'll do more than try. And watch out for deer. - Grandpa. Don't worry, okay? We'll be fine. - See ya. - See you, Lou. We'll be back, okay? I promise. See ya. (engine starting) (music) - Well, that's Claw Valley over there. This is as far as we can go in the truck. - All right. Let's do it. - All right. (engine roaring) - Think this is the place? - Let's check it out. (snuffling and neighing) - Oh, my God. (neighing wildly) - Go, Amy! - You okay? - Fine. I'm fine. (soft dramatic music) - Amy, it's not safe! Amy, stop! (neighing) Amy, would you just... (snuffling) - Hey. Hey. Good girl. Hey... Oh... Hey, you're okay. You're okay. (snuffling) Good girl. - This mare's pregnant. - Ty, these aren't wild horses. These are just quarter horses. - What are they doing here? - Who knows. Good girl. Hey, girl. - They all have frostbite. Where you going? - To get hay and blankets. - Okay, that's... good, Mallory. Just slice the nuts a little bit finer. Okay? (door opening) - Did you get them? - Yes, I got them. Have you heard anything from Amy and Ty yet? (Christmas music) - Amy called when they were on the road and she said they'd call back when they got into cell range. You know, I still can't believe you let them go. I needed all hands on deck and now I'm totally stressing and I think I'm breaking out. - Peter called. It's not looking good for a happy Christmas homecoming. Hence the mood. You should just get on a plane and go to Estevan, cancel the stupid open house. - I can't. How unprofessional would that be? - Lou, why do you set yourself up like this? Do you have to be on all the time? You need a dimmer switch. Just like the ones you sent me into town for, just like the ones I went to seven different hardware stores to find... - Grandpa, Hudson doesn't have seven different hardware stores. - ... packed with crazy Christmas shoppers. - Okay, they're important. - They make the lights look pretty. - Hmm. Dimmer switches... - You gotta love the Christmas spirit just oozing out of everyone's pores. (panting) (neighing) - Here. Ready? One... two... three! Well, maybe there's another way outta here. I'm gonna take a look around. - Okay. Baby. - So it's not good. Nothing but dead ends... waterfall, cliff. - There's gotta be some way out. (music) (whinnying) Come on. (clicking tongue ) Come on. - Come on, boy. (neighing) Come on. There you go. Come on. (snorting) Come on. (neighing wildly) Oh, Amy! Hey, you all right? - All right? - Yeah. Whoa... Easy, boy. - Amy, this isn't gonna work. The snow's too deep, they're gonna break their legs. - It's all right, buddy. We'll find a way to get you outta here, okay? - Amy, look... they're trapped. This is an impossible situation. - We gotta try. (Ty sighing) - Okay, well... they have enough food for tonight. We'll come back tomorrow and we'll figure it out from there. - Okay. - We should get going. - Yeah. Good boy. (snorting softly ) - Are you hungry? - Starvin'. - Here, let me get that for you. (country music) - What can I get for you? - Some menus, please. Thanks. - Thank you. All right, you call him. - I'm not calling. It was your idea, you call. - Wuss. Great, there's no reception. - There's a payphone over there. - It's not working. - Oh. Do you... have a phone I could use? - Long distance? - Yeah. (sighing) - Then pay me ahead. Ten dollars. - There you go. (whispering): Ten dollars? - I tried to get a hold of Amy. Does anybody know where she is? (phone ringing) - Don't ask. - Could be Lisa. (ringing) - Hello? (sighing) Amy. - Where are you? - Would you just listen? - I told Ty to head back early. - We found the horses. And we probably could've got them out, too, but... there was another avalanche. - Another avalanche? - What? Where are they? Wh-- - Pike River. - Amy, you tell Ty that he can go back tomorrow if he has to, but I want you home and I want you home now. - No, we're not coming home tonight. Okay? It's too late. We'll just stay here and tomorrow we'll go back and feed the horses and try and figure out a plan. They're in really bad shape, Grandpa, okay? Maybe we can get some of the townspeople to help us out. - Great, horsy people. - Where do you plan on staying for the night? - What? Staying? Together? No. Give me the phone, Jack. - Just let me handle this. - Like you've done such a good job so far. Give me the phone. Put Ty on the phone. - For you. - Yes, sir... Absolutely... Okay... Your dad's in a good mood. - Uh, excuse me. Is there a place in town we can stay? - No. - There was a hotel that we passed on the way in. - It's closed for the season. - Uh... you sure there's not somewhere? Just really don't wanna spend the night in our truck. - Sam. Where have you been all day? I could've used your help here. - What about the house? They could stay there. They can't stay in their truck. - Sorry, I didn't catch your name. - Joanna Hawke. - I'm Amy Fleming. - I'm Ty Borden. (flicking light switch) (door closing) - That'll get your fire started. There's more wood outside. I'd like the rent in advance. (sighing) Make it 50 a night. - Fifteen? - Fifty. - Fifty! - And about those horses out in Claw Valley? Just stay away from there. That'd be my advice. It's dangerous. (howling) (snorting) ? Deck the halls with boughs of holly... - The snow conditions out that way are terrible. - No, they aren't. I checked the report. - On what? Your old ham radio? Why don't you try the Internet, Jack? They got snow out there the day before yesterday. (Lou sighing) - It's gorgeous. Best tree ever. No, no, no, no. It's perfect... just the way it is. - Of course it is. (cellphone ringing) - Finally. Hi, Dad. Where are you guys? Can't you catch a flight home earlier? - For crying out loud, will you give it a rest? - No. No, because I still don't get it. Why would you even let them go? They got out there day before yesterday. Fresh snow on top of packed snow: deadly combination. Those two could get buried in another avalanche. - The weather's gonna be fine tomorrow. I'll drive out there and get 'em packing. - Good idea. - Great. I'm going. - No, you're not. - Hell, I'm not. - I'm not gonna be cooped up in a truck with you for three hours! - Look, I don't care who goes, but I am disowning all of you if you are not back ASAP. - There's, um, a massive... snowstorm in Halifax, so... my mom and dad won't be home for, like, days. - So much for the supply of wood that Joanna said was outside. I just chopped up an entire tree. Come look at this. That kid Sam? He's Joanna's son. They must've lived here. This is Grade 4 probably, what, five years ago? You cold? (Ty chuckling) I'll make you some tea. It'll warm you up. - All right. - Or not. - Ah, forget it. I got a better idea. (banging) Oh. - Oh, gross. - Yeah. All right. Oh, thank you. - Welcome. - All right. (Amy laughing softly ) Comfy? - Mm-hmm. (creaking) What was that? - It's the damper! Argh! (Amy laughing) Oh, man. (coughing) Oh, God! Argh! (coughing) Whoa! It's like your dad rigged the place! - What are you lookin' at? - Nothing. Is it me, or is it really cold in here? - Now that you mention it... I'll check the heater. It's, uh, stone cold. (knocking) - Mallory? Mallory, you okay? Are you okay? - I don't mean to be such a baby. I've just never been alone on Christmas before. - Well, you're not exactly alone. You're a pretty important part of this family, don't you think? - You're not alone, Mallory. Is there anything we can do to help? - There's nothing anyone can do. Well... there is one thing. If I had some of my own Christmas stuff, it'd make me feel a little better. - Sure. No problem. - Thanks. (rooster crowing) - Okay. - What are you doing here? - I'm going with ya. - Ah, no, you are not. I told you last night. - Just get a move on. Okay? I got the truck warmin' up for your old bones. - Well, we're not taking your truck. - Well, we're not takin' that heap of yours. (neighing) - Ty. - Wolves? - Yeah, it looks like. - There's nine left. - Your friend over there, she's definitely pregnant. - She can't foal here. Not with wolves and coyotes and... - You should tell her that. - Hey, Ty... we could... we could start digging and, like, make a trench. - A trench? - Yeah. Doesn't have to be huge, just wide enough to get the horse through. - That'll take us forever. - We could get help. - Hey! What are you doing here?! Just get the hell outta here! - Those horses are gonna die! - We're just trying to get them out. - Well, don't! Just get outta here! This is private property! Are you deaf?! - I said... now! - Okay! - Lou! - What? - You promised to drive me to my house to pick up my stuff! - I will, I will, okay? Just let me get a couple more things done on my to-do list. - I've been asking you all morning. - Hello! Sorry to just drop in. - Yeah, heater's busted in the trailer. - So is it okay if we stay here till the guy comes to fix it? - Uh, well, I kind of-- - He said he was gonna do it today. - Okay. - Oh, are you making fruitcake? - Caleb, I need a favour. Can you drive me to my house to pick up my stuff? I've been asking Lou and she says she will, but she never does. - Sure. No worries. What kind of stuff? - Hey. Saw you down with the horses. - I got a call about them. - That was me. I was out there right after the slide and... I knew they needed help and no one would listen to me. Then I remembered this vet guy from Hudson. Scott Cardinal? - Yeah, I work for him. - So... what about the horses? - Can you help them? - We'd like to. - Except for some old guy just aimed his rifle at us, told us to get off the property, so... - Oh... that'd be my grandfather. - Your grandfather? - He owns the land. - So can't you just talk to him, tell him what we're trying to do? Just make him understand. - I can't. - Why? - My mom and me... we don't talk to him. Haven't for years. No one talks to Will Vernon. I... guess I wasted your time calling you guys. Sorry. - I don't know why you didn't turn off back there. -'Cause there's a better road just west of here. - I'm telling ya, I'm lookin' at the map-- - Is there any more coffee? - No. I've only made enough for me, and you had the best of that! - Well, why don't you start by holding the map the right way around? - It is the right way. - Okay? 'Cause that's gonna help. - Ah... Watch, watch, watch, watch! - Jesus! - Watch, watch, watch, watch! Ah, jeez! - What the heck? (tires spinning) What the hell was he doin', drivin' down the middle of the road?! Hey! Hey! - Will Vernon? It's been years. Jack Bartlett. - Okay? - No! No! - Yes or no? - Back it on up, Tim. Do you want me to do this?! - You know what? Just put the thing on there... - All right, you're good to go. - Okay, I know what I'm doin'. - Go!! - Easy on that bumper. Oh! - Ah! - There you go. Stay on it. Good, Will. Good, Will. Should've done it myself. - Well, lucky we had my truck. Guy's lucky we're helpin' at all, I'm tellin' ya. - Just keep your shirt on. He's an old friend of mine. We used to rodeo together. - Who drives down the middle of the road on a curve! - You're good to go, Will. Hey, it's good to see you. What, you live around here? - Nice friend. - Shut up. - Took my tow hook. - You're welcome! ? Children playing in the snow ? Santa laughing ho ho ho ho ? Frosty Frosty make a smile ? It's only winter - What the...? ? For a while (laughter) - Look at this guy. (laughter) - Uh... - Hey. - What is this? - A mini beer mug. My dad got it at this Oktoberfest thing he was singing at. But this is my mom's favourite. Just squeeze it like this... (laughter) - So gross! - That's awesome. - Thanks, Lou. I feel so much better now that my stuff is here. - Lou, is it okay if we stay here tonight? - Yeah, the heater guy had to send for a part. Can't get it till tomorrow. - I guess that's a yes. - That's great. - Hmm. (laughter) (background chatter) - Hi there. I'm, uh, Jack Bartlett. - Hi. I'm Tim Fleming. - Joanna. - Nice to meet you, Joanna. - Maybe you can help us. We're-- - We're looking for my daughter, Amy Fleming. - And she's got a friend, Ty. Do you know where we can find 'em? - Dad? - What the heck is going on here? - What were you thinking? - Excuse me? - What are you doing here? - We're bringing you home. - The horses are still trapped. - Then he can stay and deal with it. - Jack, hold on a second. We're doing this together. Amy is helping me out there. Can we at least show you what we're dealing with? So what we thought we'd do, is we'd dig a trench right through it. - Right through it? - A trench. - Well, you got a month or two of free time? Doesn't really matter, we don't need to talk about it, 'cause it's not doable. - Trench, huh? - Crazy. - Might be the only way to get these guys outta here. - Jack, you'd need a whole crew; I'm talkin' about a big crew. - Then we need to get the town on our side. - The only problem is, the guy who owns this land basically pointed a rifle at us. - Pointed a rifle? Who pointed a rifle at you?! - Sam's grandfather. - Who's Sam? - Sam Hawke. - His mom owns the bar and grill in town. - Guy have a name? I'd like to have a word with him. - Will... - Vernon. - Will Vernon. - Hold it. You come lookin' for money for that tow, you can forget it. I ain't got no money for you. - The tow was free, Will. Can you put that thing down? - Okay, what do you want? - Well, you gotta admit, it's... it's a small world, huh? I remember that rodeo. I was there. You beat me by a point. It was... a pretty wild time on that circuit. Remember that pickup band we started? Graham Tuttle and I couldn't strum a guitar worth a damn, but you played a pretty mean fiddle. - What do you want? - Well, I gotta admit, Will... I'm not too happy with you pointing that rifle of yours at my granddaughter and her friend. - That your granddaughter? - That's Amy. She just trying to help those horses. - Well, she's trespassing. - Will, just give 'em a break. I figure you owe me. We could've left you stuck out there in that ditch. - They're my horses. I'll do with my horses what I please. - Your horses? - That's right. So just get back in your pickup truck and go back where you come from. And don't go rattlin' on about any old days. Old days are dead and gone! - Well, I could care less whose horses they are! They're in trouble and I'm gonna do something about it! - What do you mean, you've got a job to do out there? - Lou-- - So, what, I'm on my own with this open house? - Simmer down. - Okay, well then, what about Christmas? Are we still gonna have a family Christmas together or-- - Of course we'll have our family Christmas. - Well, I hope so. Huh... Fine. ... Yeah, okay... Goodbye. (crackling fire ) They're not coming back. Not today, maybe not even tomorrow. Well, that's it. I'll just cancel my open house, I'll just send out a mass email and that'll be that. I have no choice. - It's just as well, Lou. - You know, you're right, Mallory. It probably is just as well, because look at this place. That is the ugliest Christmas tree I have ever seen, bar none. - The tree is ugly because of my decorations?! Oh, is that it?! I'm sorry, Lou, I've ruined your perfect tree. I'm sorry your ordered little world was rocked. How do you think I feel being stuck in this house with you and everyone else being gone?! Thank God for Caleb and Ashley! At least they have a sense of humour! You're the most horrible non-Christmas person I've ever known! - Okay, that is not true. I love Christmas. - No, you don't! All Christmas means to you is being a control freak and having everything perfect! Oh, I'm sorry, Lou, I didn't know that great-aunt Ruby's hummingbird - made with real, authentic parrot feathers.. is supposed to go next to grandma Lindy's silver freakin' star! - I don't have to listen to this. ? It's a time of love and joy ? It's for every girl and boy (Lou huffing) ? Children playing in the snow ? And Santa laughing ? Ho ho ho ho ? Frosty Frosty ? Make a smile (Lou grunting) (song skipping) ? It's only winter for a while ? Well you're still here (music fading) - You killed Frosty?! - Joanna, can we talk? I talked to Will Vernon. He's your dad, right? He says those horses that are trapped out there are his. - How would I know? - Small place. I bet you have some idea. - He's a guide. Not so much anymore, I guess, but I know he took a bunch of hunters out there in the fall. Those horses have probably been out there ever since. He obviously decided to let them fend for themselves and save on the cost of feed. Typical. - I want you to know that I knew your dad. A lot of years ago, we... we rodeo'ed together. We were pretty good friends. Let me tell you about the Will Vernon that I remember. He was a great guy. Generous guy. He had the biggest, craziest sense of humour of anyone I ever met. - Sorry, I got customers. - Hey, Joanna. - Thanks for the use of the phone. - I remember the guy you remember. I do. But he died five years ago. - You could knock. - What are you doing? - I'm moving back to my own house. I will not live under the same roof as a Frosty murderer. - Okay, Mallory, you know what? Whether you or I like it or not, you are in my care until your parents get back. - You gonna kill him too? - You're staying. End of story! - Fine, then just don't talk to me! - Fine! I never thought I'd live to see the day where I didn't have to listen to you blather on. - Okay. Talk later. Uh, Lou, we couldn't get our heater fixed. Guy couldn't get the part, it being Christmas and all. - Thanks for letting us stay the night. (soft music) (crackling fire ) (sighing) (grunting) (neighing) - Hey, Sam. - Hey. - You wanna help? - Sure. - You can help me take these bales down. (Jack): Okay... (grunting) - Thank you. Hey, guys, what do we got for ya, huh? Wanna grab the other bale? - Um, sure. - What's going on here? I told you to get outta here! - Will, what do you think you're doing? - I'm just gonna shoot these horses, put 'em outta their misery. - No, you're not! - Get outta my way! (gunshot) (neighing) - Grandpa, no! - Sam! (neighing) (rumbling) - Guys, watch out! (neighing wildly) - Get off to the side! - Go! - Sam!! - Ah! - Sam! - Ah! Grab on! - Help! - Sam! Sam! (rumbling) Sam! (all): Sam! Sam! - Hold on! Hold on! - Sam! Sam! - Sam! - Sam? - Here! Here! (alternately): Sam! - Come on, guys, get him out! - Hold on, hold on. Easy, easy. - Thank God. (Sam gasping) - Get a blanket! - Let me see. You all right? - Grandpa. - Okay. (neighing) - You're okay, son. You're all right. - How dare you involve Sam? He shouldn't have been out there in the first place! Two slides in two days! What are you thinking? - The horses, they needed-- - The... the horses?! You put my son at risk for some senseless mission? - It's not senseless. - Look, Joanna, it's probably your father's gunshot that triggered the damn avalanche. - Gunshot? - He was bent on shootin' those horses. - I told you not to go out there and you're never going out there again, do you hear me?! I already lost your father to that damn valley, I am not gonna lose you too! - What did your mom mean, about losing your dad? - I was nine. It was Christmas Eve. My dad and three of his buddies went snowmobiling together. Out along the riverbed to Claw Valley. And there was an avalanche. They were all killed. My dad and me... we were supposed to go get our Christmas tree out of the bush. He said he'd be right back. - I'm so sorry. I never would've asked for your help if I had known. - I wanna help. I'm gonna help. I'm glad you came. Even if there's nothing we can do. - Answer the door! You hear me?! How dare you have a gun anywhere near my son? Haven't you hurt him enough? Say something! I don't want you to go anywhere near him again. Ever! Do you hear what I'm saying to you?! (neighing) (panting and grunting) - Come on... What are we doing? This is crazy. - We're not crazy. - Yeah? - We're gonna do this. - Really? Well, we're gonna need some help, because otherwise we're gonna be here till spring. (panting) - We should go home. This is crazy. We should just forget about it. - Come on, Amy, this doesn't sound like you. - It's two days till Christmas. Lou is at home alone and... it just isn't fair. - I think we need to try. - Tim's right, we gotta get some help. (background chatter) Okay, we've got something to say. I hope you'll hear us out. As you know, there's some horses stuck up there in Claw Valley. - And they're in really rough shape. So we have a plan. We're gonna dig a trench right through the slide and we're gonna get them out. - A trench... You're kiddin', right? - We're not kidding. We need help. We need people to dig. I... understand there's a lot of bad memories up there, but maybe this is a way to do something positive. - Jesus H. Murphy, you people are beyond stupid. - Hey, you got a problem? - Yeah, I have a problem. Do you know how dangerous it is out there? You start disturbing snow and you're just asking for trouble. Four men died in Claw Valley five years ago. Friends. Neighbours. We don't need any more tragedies. - I understand what your concern is and... and I know it's dangerous. But there was 12 horses there and now there's nine. One was killed by wolves just the other night. - Yeah, well... those are Will Vernon's horses. - So? What does it matter whose horses they are? There's a pregnant mare out there and she's probably gonna lose her foal if we don't do something. All we're asking for is... is your help! Wow. - If you have a change of heart, you know where we'll be. (soft music) (door closing) (incoming email) - Yes! (Christmas music) - He's worse. Peter's dad. - So we're speaking? - Yes. - Just get on a plane and go. - I can't, Mallory. You know I can't. Well, Caleb and I can stay here with Mallory. Really? Are you sure? Go. Why should all of us be miserable? Hey, it's Christmas. (sighing) - Hi. Anybody around? Joanna. - What can I get for you? - Oh... some coffees for the troops. Maybe, uh, muffins. Look, I can understand you being mad at us for maybe using your place as a bit of a soapbox... but don't turn away our business. Come on. - How many coffees? - Four... and a hot chocolate. It's pretty quiet in here. - Well, you guys have a way of clearing people out. - It's just... we don't know when to quit. It's a family problem. One of many. What colour are your eyes? You've got beautiful eyes. Sort of green or... sort of blue. - How many coffees... was it? - Uh, two more. And a hot chocolate. So you haven't talked to your father for five years, since the accident? Uh, Sam told us. Well, I got you beat. My father-in-law, Jack, well, my ex-father-in-law, we didn't talk for 10 years. It took us a long time to work things out. - Sounds like one big happy family. - Yeah... I wouldn't go that far. We try. - Yeah, well, I tried too. With my dad, I did. In the beginning, I did. But he closed the door on me and he never opened it again. (sighing) And I never blamed him. What could he have done? The men, my husband, they were gone, so... - Why would I blame him? - Blame him for what? (sighing and muttering) - You can... just pay me later. (Jack groaning) - Took you long enough. - Your try walking up the side of an avalanche with four hot coffees, muffins and a hot chocolate. Here you go, buddy. - Thank you. - Boy! Dad, look how much we've done. (panting) - Yeah. I hate to say, your trench looks like a gopher hole in the back 40, honey. - Ah, Tim! - Oh, come on. You know it does, Jack. (Amy sighing) (distant voices) (indistinct chatter) - We're here to help you! - They got shovels. (indistinct chatter) We need to build ramps. The horse will never make it up without 'em. - Could we get some wood cut in town? - Absolutely. - Okay. Some plywood, maybe cut to six feet. Two-by-fours for cleats? - Okay, sure. Sounds good. - Thanks. - Amy! (neighing) He's barely breathing. (soft snorting) - It's okay. Shh... It's okay. It's okay. Shh... (soft snorting) (indistinct chatter) - Hey, Jack? (neighing) - Are you happy now?! Maybe they'll all die! Is that what you want? (knocking) - Oh. Hey, Sam. - Hi. Uh, it's... it's for you. - That is the cutest little tree I've ever seen. Thank you. Where should we put it? - How about there? - Sure. - I'm... sorry I ran off. - It's okay. - I was embarrassed... in front of all those people. - They all hate my grandfather. - For what? Why? (soft music) - I miss this place. Since my dad died, my mom, she hates Christmas. We don't even have a tree. We used to. It always stood right there. - Sam... I understand what you're going through. I do. You may not think so, but... (door opening) Sometime I'll tell you my story, okay? - Hi. - Hey. - Merry Christmas. (choir music) Excuse me. Joanna! Come on, I know you're not closed. It's cold out here. I'm hungry. Hi. - What do you need? - Well, actually, I just wanted to talk to you. - You said that you were hungry. - Here, let... let me help you. - No, it's fine. - Let me help you. I'll take it. I got... Oh! Ah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Be careful, be careful. - No, it's fine. - No, I-- - Oh! - Be careful, there's glass. Be careful. - I'm fine! I've got it. - Well, you're cut. Here. - I'm an idiot. - No, you're just... - ..you're just bleeding. - No. I got it. It's fine. Ah, I don't know what's wrong with me. I wish that choir would just quit it. It's Christmas Eve tomorrow and... I just wanna go to sleep and... wake up to find that it's all over. - You know, that's understandable. - Poor Sam. He's the one who suffers. - No family, no Christmas. - Well, you can change that. - I told you, I tried. I did. Do you think I like this situation? It's a mess. It's a total mess. - Joanna... You know, you've got your whole life ahead of you. You just... have to decide to move forward. - That's easy to say. - Remember that ten years I told you about? Well, that was ten years that I did not spend with my daughters, that I was not a part of their life. That was ten years that I will never get back. So I can tell you that there is a big price to pay for isolating yourself. So I'd really like you to come out. We could use all the help we can get. - I can't. I can't. I haven't been up there since... - Maybe it'll help. I should go. - No, it's fine. Leave it. Really, it's fine. - Just... just come. - We've hauled out rocks, now we've got a tree trunk... People are gettin' tired. We got a problem here. - Cheer up, buddy. I think your problem's solved. (vehicle approaching) (cheering) - Well, look who's here. - It's about time! - Whoo! - Hey, Mom. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. I'm fine. - Look, I'm sorry, I know you said not to, but-- - I knew you were here all along. Who else was the hot chocolate for? - Hi. Hey there. Um, I know it's Christmas Eve, but is there any chance that you guys are still open? Yeah? That's great, 'cause I'd like to buy a charm. The star? It's the one from your newspaper ad? And how much is that? It's that much, huh? Okay, well, here's the deal. Do you guys do buy-and-sell? Yeah? Th... that's great. Thank you very much. I'm gonna be right over. Thank you. Bye. (background chatter) - You got it? - Yeah. - There you go. - This is amazing. - Yeah, it is. - You're crazy. - You know, speaking of crazy... ... Lou's at home and... it's Christmas Eve... We're not even there. (background chatter) - Won't you let an old friend in, Will? I saw you out there today. - Good for you. (music playing on radio ) Well, it's my land. Why wouldn't I be up there? Huh? You know, I should've just thrown all you idiots off of there. I mean, who do you think you are? Comin' in there, makin' a mess of everything with your machines-- - For crying out... You know what? I'm wasting my time here. - Did I ask you over here? No. And make sure you pull that outside door shut when you leave! - What the hell is wrong with you, huh?! Wasting your life away holed up like a hermit! What happened? I remember you. You were the guy that always got people together. It wasn't a party till Will Vernon showed up! - That's right. Party never started till Will showed up. And look where that got me. In the end, you know, what goes around comes around? You've heard that? Well, it sure came and bit me pretty good in the end, didn't it? - I know... all about your son-in-law. The accident, I know all about it. - You don't know anything. You don't know me! Gee, you come in here... You don't know me! We rodeo'ed together, we partied together, we were half in the bag, that's another life. - Another life. It's over. - You're right. I don't know you. - Goodbye. (music playing on radio ) Ah, for chrissake! Goddammit, Christmas! It was me that took him up there! It was me who asked him to go up there! It was Christmas Eve! Christmas Eve, for God's sakes! All these young guys, they were all supposed to be helpin' their wives out, you know, and gettin' the trees in and puttin' 'em up in the house, all the usual Christmas crap, and I promised them a good time. "Let's go grab ourselves a couple cases of beer, "let's get the machines and let's head up there to the valley, there's new snow." It was beautiful. So fine, it was like brill dust. And they all came along. They all came along because I asked them to. (kicking something) Well, we were havin' a real good time. It was good. I gotta tell ya, we were drinkin' and laughin' and jokin' one minute, and then the next... Jack, it was like... white. It was like a tidal wave. I was so lucky, there was a tree right there. I grabbed it and I managed to, like, stay above the snow, eh? And then by the time it sorta cleared, I looked back... and all them guys were gone. They were just gone. (sniffling) And then I heard it, there was a slide comin'. I was terrified. You know what I did? I ran. I just ran for my life. - What else could you do? - No, no, no, no, no. You know what that feels like? All these young guys, they had their whole lives laid out in front of 'em, everything to live for, and they're all gone, they completely disappeared, and the only one left alive at the end of the day's me. The old man. I'm alive. Well... No, maybe not. Maybe... Maybe I'm dead, too. Yeah. Yes, I am. I'm dead. Wish I was. - Well... ... might as well be, the way you've cut yourself off here. - I didn't cut myself off. They all left me. (sniffling) My wife left me... (sniffling) My daughter doesn't even talk to me no more. And she won't even let me see my own grandson, for God's sake! - That is BS! You couldn't get past your own guilt to be there for her! Look, Will, I'm gonna say this and you can throw me out again! You have to take the first step to make this right. (sniffling) - It's too late in the game. It's too late, Jack. - Then take it from me... it's never too late. Merry Christmas, Will. (sighing) (circular saw) (background chatter) - Excuse me! Could I have everybody's attention just for one second up here? I'm the one responsible... for these horses here. And I just wanted to thank you... for helping them. It's a wonderful thing you've done here. That's about it. Thank you. All of you. - Well, then, pick up a damn shovel, old man. (laughter) - Come over here, Will! - All right. I'm on it. (music) (background chatter) - Hi, Tim. - Hi. Well, it was my turn to get you coffee. - Cheers. - Ty. Ty, watch out. (cheering) (cheering and applause) - Here they come, here they come! - Good job! - They all look great! (cheering) (music) (distant chatter) (country music playing) (background chatter) - Hey, Jack. Just wanna thank you, all of you, for what you did out there. Especially for sticking to it the way you did. Thank you. Young lady, I promise I will look out for those horses from here on. Cheers. - Right. Give the horses back to the guy who abandoned them in the first place. Great idea. - He'll look after 'em this time. He needs 'em. (Amy sighing) - Jo. Can I talk to you? To both of yous? I got somethin' I wanna say. It's just... It's just wrong, how... how I've left things get this way. Been, uh... I've just been an old fool. And I wanna fix it. Is there any way that... you'd be willin' to give me... give me a chance to do so? What about you, Sam? Is it all right with you? We could find a place where the light's still strong Everybody's longing for the feeling That's awesome to believe in (Caleb laughing) (Ashley): Mm. - So I managed to book a flight out first thing in the morning. Are you guys sure you're okay with this? - Absolutely. - Totally. - I'd kinda hoped that grandpa and the rest of them would make it home by now, but... I guess not, so... Christmas is officially cancelled. - Yes, it is. My parents just phoned and they can't get out. - Oh, Mallory, I'm so sorry. - So since Christmas is cancelled, I'll be in my room. (Christmas music) - Early flight. - Well... my Christmas isn't cancelled. Is yours? - Not at all. - I know we said we wouldn't get each other anything, but-- - Ash. - Look, I found a way to get you something I knew that you'd love. - Okay, I actually did the same thing. - Really? You're kidding me. - No. Not at all. (Ashley laughing) - Merry Christmas. - Thanks, babe. - Oh, my God. Caleb... It's exactly what I wanted. - Oh... Ash, this is amazing. It's... It's just that-- - But... I sold my bracelet to buy you that belt. - I sold my All Around Cowboy buckle to buy you that star. - Oh, my God. This is an O. Henry moment. - O. who? - He wrote a story called The Gift of the Magi and it's basically about this woman who sells her hair to buy her husband-- - Come here. (Mallory): Ah! - Oh... (Lou): Hey, what's going on? (Mallory): Come on! (soft music) (whinnying) - Aw. - Wow. (foal snorting softly) - Aw. (whinnying) - Foal's yours if you want her. - Well, looks like the power's out everywhere. It's pitch black out there. - Hey, did we turn the water off in the trailer? (Caleb sighing) - No, I thought the heater guy would get it. - Well, what if he didn't. The pipes might burst. - We gotta go. - No, you guys promised you'd stay and watch Mallory. - We'll be back in the morning before you leave. - Yeah, we'll see you tomorrow, all right? - Ah... - Bye. - Well, I think there's some candle holders in the china cabinet. - Any particular style or colour? - Don't push it. Mallory, look... I'm sorry I was so-- - Christmas-spirit challenged? - I didn't mean to be. I just... I really wanted this Christmas to be perfect. Like it used to be. - You have to admit, this Christmas kinda sucks. - Yeah. Kinda does. - Well, at least you get to see Peter tomorrow. - No, I... I'm not going to Estevan tomorrow. - Yes, you are. - No, I'm not. I wanna spend Christmas with you. Peter will understand. - Well, you must be happy about one thing. - Oh, really? What's that? - You can't see the horrible deed I did to your tree. (Lou laughing) - It actually does kinda look better in the dark. - Yeah. (laughter) - I miss my mom and dad. - I miss Peter. - So you have to go? - See ya later. - Yeah... I wanna make it home for Christmas. - Thanks, you know... for everything. I'm really psyched about that foal. - Yeah. - Grandpa says it's my Christmas present. I'll miss you. - I'll come back and visit. - If you ever get sick of him, there's always me. - See ya. - Well, it was good to bump into ya. - Yeah, literally. Drive on the right side of the road from now on, you crazy old fool. (Jack chuckling) - I'll try. - Thanks. - Hey, uh... take care of your family. - I will. Thanks. - Let's get this show on the road. Where's Tim? - So... - ..stay in touch. - Well, I have to. I'll miss your coffee. I gotta come back. (laughing) - Well, you would be more than welcome. - Really? You mean that? - Yes. (door opening and closing) (all): Bye! - See you later! - Later! (honking) (music) - Okay, so... you just load it up, just like that. - Mm-hmm. - Mm. It's pretty good. - Yeah. Me and my parents never really got around to making the actual gingerbread house, so we made a family tradition that every Christmas morning, we would make our gingerbread house sandwiches. - Good idea. - Merry Christmas! - Hey, anybody home?! - You're back! Finally! - Guys! You're back! - Hey. - Uh, Lou? What are you wearin'? - How are you guys doing? - It's a Wells family tradition. They're awesome. - Ah... looks great.
