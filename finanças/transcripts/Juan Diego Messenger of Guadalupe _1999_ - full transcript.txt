(bird chirps) (upbeat exotic music) (cat hisses) (cat growls) (baby crying) (cat growls) (baby crying) (baby crying) (intense music) - Juan Diego! (cat growls) Juan Diego! Let's rest for a moment. - Sorry uncle. I got carried away. - I know you want to get to mass early, but your uncle Juan Bernadino, he's getting older and Plata Loco is a long way off. - Well, I'm not so young myself and I just hope to be in your shape when I... (baby crying) - [Uncle] What was that? - It's coming from up there. (cat hisses) (baby crying) It's a baby! And in this cold! Oh little one, are you all right? (baby crying) Now, now. - [Uncle] I'm afraid she wasn't left here by accident. (man sighs) - Right. Look at her closely. (baby coos) - [Uncle] She's beautiful. - She's mestisa too, born of an Indian mother and a Spanish father. - That's true. It's so sad to see more and more mestiso babies being abandoned like this. - And all because Spaniards and Indians haven't learned to get along. - And probably never will. - Don't say that. We mustn't give up hope. - And what about her? We are too old to take good care of her. - Let's take her to Frepedo Degante at his boarding school in Mexico City. - That's a good idea. - Look at her. Her life is in our hands. And we don't even know her name. I know, he we are on the hill of Tepiak in what the Spaniards left of the temple of Tunansen, the goddess we called our little mother. - [Uncle] Yes, but so? - Well, now that we are Catholics, we know our real little mother is Mary, the mother of God. - I see. So we'll call her... - Maria. - Maria. (baby giggles) (upbeat exotic music) (people yelling in foreign language) - Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please! Step right up and discover the best tilmas in the city of Mexico. Yes, only the tilmas of Mateas. Your humble servant combined the artistry of the Mexican-Indians with the incredible textile advances of the Spaniards. (bird squawks) That's right. - Chocolate! Chocolate! - Quiet, Lalo. Not now. Sorry folks. As I was saying, it's the best of both bickering worlds all united under the exclusive signature label of Mateas. So what better way to celebrate unity than to proudly wear a tilma with the Mateas signature? They must be very expensive, you might say, but no. - Chocolate! (bird squawks) - Lalo, I said no. (people yelling in foreign language) Wait! Don't go! I not done. Look what you've done. (bird squawks) You can forget about your chocolate now. - [Lalo] Chocolate! Chocolate! - Say, is that a talking parrot? - Yes. Hello gentlemen. Mateas at your service, but nevermind the bird. You came just in time. - In time? For what? - For the sale, of course! Say, you've had this tilma for awhile, haven't you? - Yes. - But, a tilma can't last forever. Look at this one. Fit for a nobleman. Doesn't he look sharp? - But I am a man of the country. You know that to an Indian, a tilma represents who he is. - But that was before the Spaniards came. Now our traditions mean nothing and a tilma is just a tilma. - Not for Juan Diego. - Thanks anyway. Uncle, we need to go. Father Gante is waiting for us. - Chocolate! (bird squawks) Lalo wants chocolate! - And Lalo there is waiting for his chocolate. (man sighs) (upbeat exotic music) (kids giggling) (dog barks) - Hey! Sedlaly strikes again! - What a great jumper. - Antonio, will Sedlaly get the measles? - Oh Maria, only people get the measles. - Antonio, look! Uncles! Uncles! - Maria! Hello Maria! Antonio. And you, Sedlaly. - I'm so happy you came, but you mustn't go inside. Father Gante has all the measles people in there. - Maria's right, my friends. (man gasps) The sick are here. So many, I can hardly care for the children now. - We heard. - That's why we're here. To help. - I couldn't let you. It's dangerous. - That is why you need all the help you can get. - Besides, someone needs to take care of the children. - All right then. God reward you. - Yay! Now we can see uncles every day! - Antonio, could you go to the marketplace for me? I need some things for the sick. - Sure, father. (upbeat exotic music) - You! Indian! Where's the bishop's house? - I don't know. - Uh oh. Trouble. - What do you mean you don't know? It's supposed to be in this area. - I am new to this marketplace, but even if I did know where the bishop lives, why should I tell you, Spaniard? - You dare speak to a Spanish soldier that way? - Excuse me, sir! I can help you. - You get away from here. - But I know the way to the bishop's house. - You an Indian should not help a Spaniard. - You have no idea what you're getting yourself into. What's your name, Indian? - I am called Tisok. - Tisok. That means the bleeder. - Well, I'll bleed the bleeder right now if you... - But you need to get to the bishop's house, don't you? (man growls) - So where is it then? - It's that one. Over there. - Now go away, the two of you! - Yes sir. (mysterious violin music) (knocking) (dog barks) - Stop that, dog! (dog barks) (knocking) (dog barks) Okay, don't answer the door. What do I care? (dog barks) (suspenseful music) (dog barks) (boy gasps) (dogs bark) - Quiet, Ronco! You'll scare someone. (dog barks) Don't let Ronco scare you. Thanks for this scroll. It must be for Bishop Zumaragai. (dog barks) - Bye. - See how you scared that boy and his little dog? (dog growls) - [Pedro] Spoken like a true bishop, uncle. - An Indian boy brought this, your excellency. - Oh? Thank you, Father Juan. - Is it from anyone we know? - It is from Donvasco Dekiroga of the new ruling counsel. He is deeply worried about the disunity in this place. He wants to meet me and see what we are doing about it. - You certainly do your best, uncle. - Yes. You always defend the Indians. - But it never seems to be enough. Nothing ever seems to be enough. (dreary music) - I know we are sad that so many of our people are sick and dying, but we must trust that God always loves us. And now that Christmas is coming, we must get ready. That's why Father Gante has thought of deposadas. They're a lot of fun and you'll learn about Christmas, too. - Is that why we bought all this fruit? - It's for something Father Gante calls the pinata. - Look, a flower. (girl giggles) How do I look, Antonio? - Silly. That flower's pretty ugly. There are no nice flowers in December. - You're right. I just throw it away. - Wait. Give it to me. (man sniffs) - Why are you doing that? - Every flower is a sign that God is here. Our ancestors said flowers are from heaven. (birds chirp) See those birds? Their song is also a sign that God is with us. - I never heard that from the padres. They say that stuff our ancestors said wasn't from God. (dog barks) - But aren't flowers and birds gifts from God? (bright music) There. The perfect Virgin Mary. - And the perfect St. Joseph. - [Juan] That's right. - Why did you have to choose Maria? She's too little to be Our Lady. - Maria is perfect to be Our Lady because she is the littlest. To us Indians, the littlest one means the dearest one, and that is what Our Lady is to me. (dog barks) - Sedlaly! My tilma's all spotty now. - My friend, always keep your tilma clean. A tilma is more than clothing. It's a symbol of yourself. - Is that something our ancestors said? - Yes it is. - Juan Diego. Could you please come over here, Juan Diego? You're a good Catholic, the most prayerful, devoted, charitable Indian I know. - You are too kind, padrecito. - But some of these things you tell the children, you like a lot of what your ancestors believed and it did not come from God. - Father, before the Spaniards conquered us, we believed in many Gods, but we also believed in one good and almighty God, ometioto, the God of the near and far. And now we see, thanks to you good friars, that this one true God is Jesus. Many things from our past were very wrong, like the killings, but there were other things that were good and beautiful. - Juan Diego, you shouldn't teach here anymore now. You're mixed up. Go home, why don't you, and pray to our Lord to help you understand and be sorry. - If you say so, padrecito. (dreary music) - My friend. Are you sad? (man giggles) I have just the tilma to put a smile on your face. - No. Thank you. I'm sorry, senor. I did not see you. - Wait. Do I know you? - Me? - It is you. Cuatla Tuatsen. It's me, Tisok. - Tisok, my old teacher from the Colmecack school? - I left there before the Spaniards finished wrecking our world, but you're here, my best student, the bravest warrior I ever knew. Your name fits you so well. Cuatla Tuatsen, he who speaks like an eagle. - You are too kind, but I have another name now. Juan Diego, after two great apostles of our Lord Jesus. - So, you have sold out to the Spaniards, the destroyers of our temples, the cruel hypocrites? - My teacher, the Spaniards do have many faults, but so did we before they came. And they did bring the full truth in Christ. - I defile your tilma, Juan Diego, for betraying our people as our Gods betrayed us by letting the Spaniard barbarians take over. (dreary exotic music) - Dear Jesus, since I was a boy, long before I heard your name, I tried to serve the one true God, the Lord of the near and far. Am I wrong to think it was you, Jesus? I'm so mixed up. Still, I gladly offer you my troubles for my people, for the Spaniards, for the children they have together. So all might come to live together as one. (upbeat exotic music) (birds chirp) So beautiful. (birds chirp) Am I in paradise? (birds chirp) - Juanito, Juan Diegito. (man gasps) (choir sings) My littlest son Juanito, where are you going? - My Lady, Queen, my little girl, I got to Traotoloco to learn the things of God from our priests. - My littlest son, I am the ever-perfect Virgin Mary, mother of the true God for whom everything lives, the creator of every person, Lord of the near and far, master of heaven and of Earth. I want them to build a church here. I will give him to all the nations through my love, my help, my salvation because I am the merciful mother of you and of all who live as one in this land. Those who love me and look for me and trust in me, here, I will hear their crying and their sadness to cure their sufferings and sorrows. Go to the bishop of Mexico and tell him I sent you so he would know I want him to build a church here. I will reward you for helping me. - Yes, my Lady. (bird squawks) - Yes. There's Juan Diego. He looked so sad yesterday. Hey, Juan Diego! Look what I've got! The perfect tilma to cheer you up? Was that a smile on his face? - That is everything I heard and saw, my Bishop. - Juan Diego, I will consider what you have told me. After that, please, come back to see me again. - Yes, your excellency. (man hums) (bird squawks) - Here comes Juan Diego! (man giggles) I'm going to get him now that he's in a good mood. Juan Diego, look! You won't believe this new material! It won't shrink and... - [Juan] Not now, Mateas. - What's with this guy? (choir sings) - My little daughter, the Bishop isn't sure. If you sent a nobleman instead of me to talk to him... - My smallest son, I have many who would help me, but you must be the one who helps me. Go see the bishop tomorrow. - My lady, I don't want to make you sad. I'll go. (bright flute music) - You know, I miss Juan Diego. - Me too. - I am glad that the brothers are back. - So am I. There is so much to be done. Thank you for all your help to the sick. - It was nothing, Father. - Now go home to our dear Juan Diego. I am sure he needs you. - Thank you for your latest report, Juan Diego, and for answering all my questions. I know you are sincere, but I still need a sign to prove that the Queen of heaven did send you. - What kind of sign, Lord Bishop? - That is up to our lady. (dreary music) (man giggles) What are you laughing at, Pedro? - Certainly you don't believe that Indian? - As a matter of fact, I am beginning to. He seems so sincere. Would you two be so kind as to follow him and see what happens? (man sighs) - But uncle. - Are you afraid that what he says is true? (suspenseful music) - Juan Diego. (dramatic music) Juan Diego. (man yells) Juan. Diego. (upbeat exotic music) (men breathing heavily) - He sure can run. For somebody his age. (dramatic music) (man yells) - Are you all right? - You. Enough of this. I quit. - Me too. We'll never catch up with that Indian. - All right my son, come back tomorrow to get the sign for the Bishop. I will repay you. I will wait for you here, tomorrow. (upbeat music) - Uncle. You're home. (dramatic music) Uncle! What's wrong? - Juan Diego. I don't feel very well. - You caught the measles. (rooster crows) My lady, I know I was to meet you today to get the sign, but my uncle is sick. You know I must stay here, my little girl. - Juan Diego, I think this is it for me. - I will go look for a doctor. - No. Juan Diego, what I need is a priest. (dramatic violin music) - My uncle, I will go right now and hurry back with a priest. (upbeat exotic music) Wait. If I go another way, the little Queen might not find me until after I help my uncle. - Where are you going, my smallest son? - My little girl, you are here at dawn. I've made you sad, but my uncle might die. I'll do what you ask me as soon as I find him a priest. - Remember this, my littlest son, let nothing worry you. Do not fear this illness or any problem. Am I not here, the one who is your mother? Don't I bring you joy? Won't I protect you? Do you need anything more? Do not let your uncle's illness worry you. He will get well. - Then my Lady, I'll take your sign to the Bishop. - My littlest son, go. Cut flowers on the hill where I first spoke to you and bring them here to me. - [Juan] Roses of Castilla, so beautiful. (bright piano music) - My littlest one, these flowers are the sign. Tell the Bishop he will see my wish in them. You are my messenger. I trust you. I command you, show only the Bishop what is in your tilma. (bird squawks) - See? What did I tell you? He's happy today. Just like you, Lalo. One moment you're happy and cheerful, next moment, you're sad. Just like that. No reason at all. Hey, Juan Diego! I got a new batch of... - Not now, Mateas. Not now. - What's that? A rose of Castille? Where did he get one of these in December? (suspenseful violin music) (knocking) - Here again, Juan Diego. What's with you this time? What's in your tilma? - It's something for the Bishop. I must see him. - He's in a very important meeting. Hasn't he heard enough of your stories by now? If you'll excuse me, I have to go back in. (upbeat exotic music) - Not you again. Hombre, you may be crazy, but you're persistent. (knocking) (dog sniffs) - Pedro, Donvasco Dequiroga is here. - Ronco, let's go! Ronco! - Juan Diego, you're still here? - May I see the Bishop now? (man sniffs) - I smell roses. Are those flowers in your tilma? - Let me see. (dog barks) Ronco, what is the matter? - Don't worry, your excellency. I will personally do everything I can to help you bring unity. - Thank you, Donvasco. - [Pedro] Ronco, are you listening to me? - Will you excuse me for a moment? - Of course. (dog growls) - Father Gonzales, what is going on? - Your excellency, you'd better see this. (dog barks) - Ronco, get off me! Have you gone crazy? - Juan Diego, you are here? Come in. And Pedro. - Yes uncle? - Please, stop whatever you've been doing to upset poor Ronco. - My Bishop, here is the sign. Our Lady, beloved mother of God, told me to lay the proof at your feet so you would obey her right away. - Our Lady? A sign? - So he says. - Pedro. Juan Diego, I'm sorry. Please, continue. - She told me to cut flowers, yet it is the wrong season, and on that hill grow only thorns, prickly pears and mesquite, but I obeyed and when I cut them on the hill of Tepiak, I brought them to her and she arranged them in my tilma with her holy hands. She told me to show them to you as proof she wants her church built. Here they are. Please receive them. (bright piano music) - Roses? (bright piano music) - Our Lady. (bright piano music) God forgive me for not doing Our Lady's will right away. - But why do you all kneel? - This is why. (choir sings) - My little Queen. - [Maria] She wears tilma like me! - Holy Mary of Guadalupe, that is her name. She told me herself when she appeared to me and cured me. - And to think that I didn't like your tilma. - [Tisok] Just as I didn't like you, Juan Diego. - [Juan] Tisok. - I thought you were a traitor by trying to be both a true Indian and a good Christian, but I was wrong. - We were all wrong, but now, God has shown us that we should all be one. - But there's another problem now. - A problem? - Yes. Now Juan Diego doesn't have a tilma to wear! - Huh? - Yes. So, here is my final offer. I'll give you a tilma free. This, you can't refuse. (laughter) - You've got yourself a customer. (laughter) (dog barks) - Come on everyone. Time for the posadas. - Yeah. Let's go.

Within the next five years, more than eight million people embraced the Catholic faith. A church was built on the hill of Tepiak, and today, the tilma of Juan Diego still bearing our Lady's miraculous image rests in a beautiful basilica. Every year, more than 14 million pilgrims from around the world come to pray to our Lady of Guadalupe. (upbeat exotic music)
