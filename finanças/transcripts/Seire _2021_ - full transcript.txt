SAMCHIL-IL, KNOWN AS "SEIRE," REFERS TO A BABY'S FIRST 21 DAYS. THE HOME IS PROTECTED WITH ROPE TO KEEP OUTSIDERS OUT... ENSURING THE INFANT'S SAFE PASSAGE INTO THE WORLD, AND NO TABOO SHOULD BE BROKEN. Honey, what are you doing? Apples... I'm craving apples. Honey, I brought apples. Come on out. What for apples? I mean, didn't you--? - You said you were craving apples. - Huh? Did you daydream or something? You're not supposed to eat apples at night. Maybe you had one of those conception dreams? I'm just messing around. Why don't you put that knife down? Just come to bed. Let's go to sleep. SEIRE Did you sleep well? Oh, did I-su wake up? You look very tired these days. Yeah... I just had a really weird dream. What kind of dream? Remember the other night? You asked me to get apples. Huh? I-su was sitting in front of the fridge and said: "I'm craving apples." I-su did? And then? Then I-su started crying like something was hurting. Stop talking nonsense... - ...and get going. - Okay. Be careful today. Don't do anything unusual. If anyone asks, tell them I had a bad omen. Nobody will ask me anything unusual. Mommy is at it again, isn't she? Tell her, I-su. "A nightmare is actually a good omen." Just in case, behave yourself. Should I ask my sister to give Mom a ride? That's right. She's leaving today. Don't act surprised. I asked you before. Out of all days, he had to call today. Could you give her a ride? How? With I-su in my arms? Of course not. Could you ask your sister instead? I'm so sorry. "Daddy, please come home early." This time, Mommy would love some dahlias. I'm leaving. Sweet I-su knows what Mommy wants. BABY IS SLEEPING PLEASE KNOCK ON THE DOOR I'm sorry but I need to take care of my baby. I won't be able to meet up tomorrow. I see. It's been a little less than three weeks. I'll send you some conceptual designs then. Yes, thank you. Mom, I'm so sorry. It's okay. I just need to get to the terminal. Make sure to eat the seaweed soup I made for you. I'll come back in no time. Take good care of the baby. Stop worrying so much. Mom, hurry up! Wow, your sister is so antsy. Mom, why would you make a pregnant lady wait outside? - Why can't I go in with you? - No way! Don't say you waited outside when you live next door. I'm also pregnant with your grandchild, you know? Boohoo, your grandma doesn't give a damn about you. That's why she made us wait outside. No outsiders should visit until Seire's over... ...when there's a newborn in the family. Why am I an outsider? How about you? I'm the mother of the mom, so it's fine. I'm sorry, Sis. You must be uncomfortable. - Mom, have a safe trip. - For sure. - No need to get out. Be careful. - Stop with the back and forth. Let's go. See you. Yes, the doctor on the third floor asked for the same thing. Yes. It's for the son who gave you money for the wedding. Sure. I'll make sure to deliver the usual stuff. Okay, bye. You need it by Monday? That's such a rush. I know. Who knew doctors could be into herbal tonics? We have good stuff. It works like a charm. Marriage is like a competition. You need to have kids once you're married. Only then you can walk around with your head up. Stop talking nonsense. Give a hand over there. Go ahead. You can tell the difference between families with and without kids. That's why our stuff is flying off the shelves. Having kids or not is none of your business. Go make the tonic. He's right. Your stuff is good. I don't know if we can fill the order by Monday. Anyway, give me a heads-up before you come by. - Sure. Sorry to bug you on a weekend. - No worries. - I'll get going. - Bye. I heard you recently had a baby. - Give this to your wife. - No, it's okay. - You've already been so generous. - Take it. I've prepared the usual stuff. You know our carp tonic is the best for childbirth. - Give this one to your sister-in-law. - You added one for my sister-in-law? I appreciate it. - Thank you. Take care. - Bye. Honey. I-su. - Shush. I-su's sleeping. - I see. I told you to wash your hands when you come home. - Okay. - Why would you do that? What are these? The tonic place gave them to me as congratulatory gifts. One of them is for your sister. It's good for pregnancy. My sister never takes herbal tonics. Why did you bring hydrangeas when I said dahlias? Huh? You like them a lot. Aren't they pretty? I needed them to make a sample for an order. Even I-su would've known. I-su, Mommy is coming. OH SE-YOUNG PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY, 19TH. - What's going on? - I received an obituary. Don't go to the service. Just send condolence money. Okay. - Hey. - Oh, it's you. - You're home early. - Yeah. You already got everything else except meat, right? Yes. - Excuse me. - How can I help you? I'll have three pounds of ribs and sirloin. - Some tenderloin as well. - Okay. Lean meat is supposedly better for pregnancy. - That's correct. - You're okay with beef, right? Of course. Here you go. I wish I could drink wine with it. Should we grab drinks without the wives later? I don't mind driving, you know? That's okay. You paid for everything after all. I'll take it. - Give me one more. - It's fine. When are you gonna start addressing me more casually? It's a force of habit. Because of Mother. Anything your wife doesn't like? Nothing. She devours everything. Bro, would you take these? I'll be there with her soon. - Come right over. - Okay. Honey. Hey. You're not supposed to eat the lettuce. Please, don't be Mom. I'd been wanting for her to leave so badly. - What about Mother? - You don't know? Mom won't let us eat lettuce during pregnancy. She thinks it causes seizures in babies. Because of that, I couldn't eat barbecue. That's too much. Nobody believes that kind of stuff anymore. Right, she wouldn't even let you in here, you know? I know, she's into all kinds of superstitions. But... it turns out to be true sometimes. - No way. - Don't you remember? Dad got caught lying about going to a funeral. Mom had a nightmare and insisted he didn't go, but he went anyway... ...and our home was broken into. Thanks to Mom for redirecting our misfortune. We could have been in big trouble. Gee, you're your mom's daughter. Woo-jin, isn't it too much... ...your wife and mother-in-law being so superstitious? It's not too bad. - Sounds like Father shouldn't have lied. - Maybe. Anyway, don't eat the lettuce. - Fine, I won't. - I'll take it. I-su looks just like Hae-mi when she was a baby. Such an angel, right? How sweet. I-su, why do you cry so much? Please, stop. We can hear you next door. Your cousin can't sleep at night because of your crying. I-su, tell your aunt you're sorry. Say: "I'm sorry, Cousin." Maybe you had one of those conception dreams? Honey? Honey? Huh? - Make sure you eat some too. - Okay. I'll bring them right over. So cute. I hope my baby is as adorable as yours. I'm sure yours will be even more adorable. OH SE-YOUNG PASSED AWAY ON FEBRUARY, 19TH. PLEASE SHARE YOUR CONDOLENCES. SERVICE: YEON-WON FUNERAL HOME I thought you were sleeping. Where are you going this late? I told you someone passed away. - Who is it? - A friend. - What friend? - Someone I went to college with. Do you have to go? I should. It's for one of the few friends I kept in touch with. Don't go. You shouldn't go to a funeral when there's a newborn in the family. I'll pay my respects and come home right away. I won't be long. My name is Jin Woo-jin. I went to college with her. I see. Woo-jin! You came. I don't remember when I last saw her. It must've been years. I didn't see her after graduation. Wait, maybe I saw her with you once. That was still years ago. I barely talked to her. I think Woo-jin saw her most recently, right? By the way, is it okay for you to come here, Woo-jin? Why would you say that? Whatever happened was a long time ago. Not that. I'm talking about the baby. You recently had a baby, right? You got married? When? Right, you guys didn't know. He got married. Hey, congrats! Why didn't you invite us to the wedding? We were in a rush. I couldn't reach out to everybody. Enough about the wedding. This punk had a baby not too long ago. Congratulations, Daddy. But seriously, you're not supposed to go to a funeral after having a baby. - Right? - Are you drunk? Nonsense. People even bring their babies to funerals. - Congratulations, Woo-jin. - No way. You need to be careful. Woo-jin, ask for some salt from the kitchen when you can. Thank you all for coming. I know you guys had lost touch with Se-young. How sad we had to reach out for such tragic news. If there's anything we can do to help... ...please let us know. Everything is taken care of. Thank you. Oh, I... Shall we make a toast? - We shouldn't. - You're right. Ye-young. Excuse me. Hey. I mistook her for Se-young when I first saw her. Is this the first time you've met Ye-young? Yes. I knew Se-young had a sister but had no idea they were twins. Seriously? Even for twins, their resemblance is uncanny. - That's what I said. - It freaked me out a bit too. Thank you so much for coming. It's pretty late, so have a safe trip home. Ye-young... ...you must be exhausted. Get some rest. We'll be here for the burial as well, so don't you worry about a thing. We will take care of everything, okay? Just tell us what you need. Whatever it is. You don't need to see us out. Bye. What? See you. You're absolutely hammered. She's Se-young's twin sister, so she's our friend. - Okay, just go. - I told her we should be friends. They look exactly the same. I know! Do twins always look so alike? I didn't know Se-young had a twin sister. So imagine the shock when I saw her. Did you guys see that? Ye-young did this eye-twitch thing. Se-young used to do that. Right? By the way... ...has anyone heard what happened to Se-young? I heard there was an accident. - What kind of accident? - I don't know. I heard it from Ye-young but I don't know the details. It's rude to ask those questions at a funeral. - Let's go home. - Yeah, I'm leaving. - Bye. - See you at the burial. How's your baby doing? Well. About what I said earlier, I didn't hurt your feelings, did I? No, don't worry about it. I thought you wouldn't come. You and Se-young broke up not too long ago. How long has it been? A year? Of course, I had to come. I guess. Anyway, did you hear about it from Ye-young? I heard it from Se-young. What? I got a message from Se-young's phone. You're Jin Woo-jin. We've met before. Really? I don't remember... I heard so much about you. She told you about me? She didn't tell me anything about you. I knew everything. Twins don't keep secrets. I've been wondering, though... Can I speak casually to you? Yeah, sure. You dated Se-young for a long time. How was it after the breakup? How was Se-young? I'm not sure what you're asking. Sometimes, twins have a connection with each other. It's pretty amazing. We have our similarities in what we like or dislike... ...but the connection is nothing like that. It's hard to describe, but it's almost like a special network between us. But after you guys broke up... ...something didn't feel right. I couldn't figure out what Se-young went through... ...and I was hoping you could tell me. I really wanted to see you. And that time has come, at last. Gosh, it's cold. You should go in. It's pretty late. Yeah, let's go. Thank you for listening to me. Sure. Se-young must be elated to have seen you. What is it? Can you make it to the burial? The burial? We need people to carry the casket but I have no one else to ask. Tae-ho and other guys said they'd do it. I was hoping you could also help. Please. Of course, I'll be there. - See you then. - Okay. YOU DATED SE-YOUNG FOR SIX YEARS. YOU SHOULD COME TO THE BURIAL. What are these? When did she sneak them in? Seriously... Why are you still up? Why are you so late? You said you wouldn't be long. Sorry, I had a lot of catching up to do with my college friends. - Did anything strange happen? - Would you please stop? When did you put red beans in my pocket? The fact that I went to the funeral doesn't worry me. But you acting like this is disturbing. Is I-su sleeping? Don't you dare. You can't touch the baby after coming back from a funeral. Go wash your hands. Don't even think about coming into the room tonight. Woo-jin. - Yes? - What are you doing tomorrow? Tomorrow? I'm off. Why? What's going on? I'm pregnant. I-su? Honey, what's going on with I-su? Would you make the baby formula I asked for? Okay. Damn it. - What is it? Did you forget? - I'll go buy it right away. I'm here. Give me a second. Honey? Honey. Is I-su okay? What's going on? - Did you bring the formula? - Huh? - I asked about the formula. - Yes, I did. I'm making it right now. I'll bring it. I-su... ...you do look like your dad... ...but have Mommy's eyes. Is something wrong? I-su has a fever. What's with you? I had a dream. - Is I-su okay? - Wait. Don't come in. What? Turn around. I'm supposed to do it forcefully. You had a nightmare? I think you broke the taboo. What taboo? You must've broken the taboo by going to the funeral. I just went to pay respects to my dead friend. We need to be extra careful until Seire is over. Babe... With one cry, I instantly know what I-su needs. But today, it was different. I'd never heard I-su cry like that. You definitely brought something from the funeral. I didn't bring anything. You didn't see anything strange? What was the nightmare about? - My parents used to avert crises... - Welcome. ...by stealing things from busy places, like a pub or a store. That way, your misfortune is redirected and can't find a way back to you. I'm asking you to do this, just in case. It won't harm anyone and we can stop being so anxious. The last thing should be a personal item. From just anyone? I know you're not comfortable, but do this for I-su. If it's still too much, remember that you're putting my mind at ease. Three items, from a bar, a store, and a person. Excuse me, are you okay? I'm sorry. I'm terribly sorry. Jin Woo-jin? So you got spooked because you thought I was Se-young? Yes, I'm sorry. I haven't had a chance to grab my stuff. Then I finally got some time, so I came home. Have a seat. - Why are you standing like that? - Uh... no reason. Give me a sec. I'll grab your stuff. - What is this? - I don't know. I found it when I was going through Se-young's stuff. I can't take this. Woo, it's bitter. It's also very fishy. What is this? You shouldn't have. Can I give you anything in return? I'll tell you if something comes to mind. You probably want something big. I always give and I never ask for anything in return. However, I'll give it some serious thought this time. - Seong-tak? - Hey, Woo-jin. What a surprise. - Where have you been this late? - I had some errands to run. Give me the bags. - What are these? - My wife had this sudden craving. But it's so late. Where did you get these? I have a few tricks up my sleeve, bro. - Take some for your wife. - There's no need. Just take it. We're good. - Are you planning to have another baby? - Another one? I think the second time will be easier. Maybe. This is my first after all. - What is this? - It's... I get it. - Bro. - Okay. Honey, I'm home. - Come in. - Okay. Where did you get these in the middle of winter? Whatever my baby wants, my baby gets. - Is she taking the herbal tonic? - Of course. Did you get them? - I didn't know you were here. - I helped him with the bags. Babe... Can I talk to you for a second? - I think I'll go home. - Don't. You gotta take them. It's okay, I'll just go. Why would you bring him home this late? I just bumped into him... What will he think of me? It's so late. Honey, I'll do it. Like this? Babe, would you order some herbal tonic for me from your usual place? Since I took a long leave... ...I want to give them to my colleagues. I heard they make good stuff for women. What kind do you want? I place the orders, but I'm not familiar with their stuff. I'm not sure. If you give me their number, I'll ask myself. Why don't we go together next time? They even gave us the stuff for your sister. We should thank them together. If they know your sister got pregnant after taking their tonic... ...they'll pay extra attention to your order. There you go. Did it really work for my sister? The pregnancy tonic? No way. People praise it because they hear about how good it is. Is that so? - Hello. - Oh, it's you. You really don't need to give us freebies. By the way, is there a pregnancy tonic? One of my clients is asking. You need to take two at a time. - How much do you need? - So you have it? Sheesh, you made a mess. Are you trying to cause a miscarriage? What was the order again? - Was it for pregnancy or miscarriage? - Get your shit together. We can't mix these up. It's here. Make sure they don't get mixed up. Wow, I'm in trouble. I'll get yelled at if they get mixed up. People look for all kinds of stuff, don't they? For sure. The miscarriage tonic is popular these days. There's no such thing. Was it Se-young's funeral? Huh? Sorry, I saw Tae-ho's text earlier. I mean... - I didn't want to upset you. - Why would you lie to me? I'm mad about the lie, not because you went to the funeral. You've been acting so irrationally. You wouldn't have allowed me to go if you'd known. Lower your voice. I-su is sleeping. - What's that sound? - What sound? There's no sound. Don't change the subject. No, wait. Guys! Guys! - Please help! My wife is-- - Sis! Are you okay? - One, two, three. - Wait. - What's happening to her? - She's been like this since morning. - Help us! - Take it easy. Are you okay? Help! - Almost there. Hold on. - She's having contractions. Please see her. - No! - Babe, are you okay? Ma'am. Ma'am, please try to be still. Ma'am, are you okay? - Is she having contractions? - I'm not sure. Babe! Try to be still, Ma'am! She shouldn't pull... Hold on, babe. Why won't it come off? Ma'am! Let's untie this line first. She bled quite a lot and needs to rest. Please, stay with her and let us know if anything happens. Okay. By the way, how did this happen? I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like this before. I don't think she experienced any external trauma... ...but maybe she ingested food or medicine... ...that didn't agree with her. I'm sorry to bring this up... ...but she was a little over 25 weeks pregnant... ...and we can make arrangements for the funeral if you want. What happened? Tell me what happened. She had a miscarriage. What did you say? I'm coming, I-su. I-su has a fever. What should we do? Let's go, hurry. I think... ...that this is happening because you went to the funeral. - That's nonsense. - What is it, then? The doctors can't figure out why. We transferred the baby to the NICU. We need your consent... ...to run some tests... Did you do what I asked last night? Of course, you didn't. Why? Because you didn't want to curse anyone in case it's real? All you had to do was take something from a stranger. Tell me. Please, tell me that you did what I asked. You stole those things last night and I-su will be just fine! Could you please tell me that? Just checking in on I-su and my sister-in-law. Also... ...please take this back. It's not ours. Wait. Wait. Hey. Come on, Seong-tak. Brother, let me explain about the knife. Don't call me brother. I don't believe that shit. Go stay with your wife. Please... Stop following me. You creep me out. Why are you carrying this knife? It's not what you think. I accidentally put it in my pocket. Accidentally? I get it. It's her. She followed you from the funeral. Seire's not even over, yet she's stealing I-su's breath. What else could it be? Answer me. Se-young. I'm sorry... ...but it wasn't you, was it? Would you let go of my baby? Please? I'm Woo-jin's wife. I felt like I should pay a visit. Thank you. I'm leaving now. By the way, how did she die? Suicide. She got pregnant. Then she lost the baby. She didn't get an abortion. It was a miscarriage. She was in so much pain. We didn't know why. We didn't know what we did wrong. So I've been searching for an answer to figure out why. But Se-young didn't want it. Maybe she turned a blind eye after learning the reason... ...or she didn't know... ...but she was scared to find out. She seemed better after a while... ...then she killed herself. Honey. I told you not to go to the funeral. Stay away. Stay away from me and I-su. At least for now. What are you doing? Why are you still here? Has everybody left? Your parents? I told them to go home and rest before the burial. What about you? I was going to stay here until the burial. When I saw her today, it felt like she was alive. Right. That makeup made her look... ...as though she was alive. Like she was going to wake up real soon. It felt so strange. Her face was so cold... ...yet it looked exactly like mine. I felt like I was looking at my dead body. At the same time, I wondered... ...if she was really dead. They say reality hits you as the funeral continues... ...but not for me. I feel like she's more and more alive. That's the tie I gave you yesterday. Right. I was in a hurry. You always told me... ...you'd give me everything I wanted. Except for a baby. What's wrong? What did you just say? Huh? Nothing. Never mind. I'm going to rest my eyes for a bit. You should, too. Nobody will come this late anyway. The burial will start early in the morning. Se-young. You're stealing a baby's breath. Our baby's breath. Please give it back. I'm begging you. What did I do so wrong? Stop being so blind! We were both worried. You were just as scared as me, right? Please, stop. Please, let go of my baby. Hey. Woo-jin! Did you sleep here? Are you okay? Why are you sweating so much? - What time is it? - Wake up. The burial will start soon. Already? It's time. You must've been sound asleep. This is a funeral home, you know? - Can we have everybody gathered here? - For sure. Fix yourself up a bit. What time does the burial start? We should go soon. Tae-ho... I have to go. Why? Something happened? Yes, I have a family emergency. Would you please tell Ye-young? I mean, you should tell her yourself before you go. Woo-jin, are you leaving? Yes, something came up. I'm sorry. I was hoping you'd stay through the cremation at least. Is this how you're gonna treat her in the end? - We will move to the funeral hall now. - Okay. Hey, just stay till the end, would you? I'll be at the funeral hall. She was not well. Remember how she told you about the miscarriage? She kept thinking about that moment. She wasn't well after that. By the way, congratulations on the baby. Even though you never wanted children. Still, congrats! We will now start the burial ceremony. Woo-jin... I had a miscarriage. Honey. Hae-mi. You're home. How is I-su? I-su is fine. That's a relief. The doctor said we should monitor him for a few days, though. Okay. I need to leave. Would you finish making the formula? Also, feed I-su if he wakes up. - Okay. - I won't be long. Make sure you're not making it too hot. Have a good time with your son. It's been a while after all. Retail-Resync by jantoniot
