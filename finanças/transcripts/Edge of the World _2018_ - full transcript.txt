Subtitles by explosiveskull We have some new additions to our home, Jay and Willy. They'll be sharing a room with Jeremy. Jay and Willy, we all chip in to keep things running smooth and comfortable to keep the house clean, so feel free to help out. And remember, we're you're house parents, we're here for whatever you need. Now we can bow our heads. Father, bless this food. Thank you for the nourishment it provides. We welcome Jay and Willy into our home, and we thank you that they can be with us. As we enjoy this meal and after help us be mindful of the needs of others. Amen. Where you going? What your back, bro, something out there, and it ain't friendly. Represent. Represent. Represent. Represent. Represent. What's up, man? Good morning, Mr. Tibbe, we're glad you're here, welcome. Okay, class, you have a choice this semester. For your extra credit assignment you can either keep a journal or you can write a letter every week. Yes? If we write a journal, that's like a diary, right? Right. You're not gonna read them? No, no, I'm just gonna flip through it, make sure you did it, everybody gets an A. And what about the letters? Are you gonna read those? No, same thing. Good, 'cause I don't think you should be looking at our private stuff. I agree, Angela. But, you know, I think you should mail those letters. Letter writing is a lost art. I think that they will have a big impact on whoever reads 'em. So, where you headed? I'm Willy. I have stuff to do. Stuff, I like stuff. Hey, Angela, you're looking good today. You know that guy runs like a girl. I'm a girl, and I could run circles around you. Um, uh, I'll see you later. You need to be in school. You need structure and stability, and I can't give that to you right now. I don't understand why I just can't go on the road with you. We tried that approach and we both got in trouble, so we're trying this now. You can't keep me here. First chance I get, I'm gonna leave. Yeah, looking good, champ, looking good. I give you another mile before you pass out from heat exhaustion, the way you're dressed. Also, you got no water, got no form, you're sucking wind after one hill. What do you care? Who are you anyway? Coach Davis. You know if you like to run, you can come run for me. Practice everyday at four. Of course from the looks of you, I'm not sure you could hang with my runners. Whatever, man, I smoke those dudes. Oh, you smoke those dudes, cool. You're welcome to come prove that if you want, but please, carry on. Have a nice day. Yeah? Got a sec? Yeah, Chaplin, come on in. Listen, Mitch, I wanna apologize about this morning. We didn't have time to speak. I am sorry about Michael. I know you loved the kid. And I know Jeanie loved him too. Yeah, actually I'm glad you came in because I wanna talk to you about this new kid, Willy-- Hold on a second. Davis. Coach, Andy Andrews here from the Brentmoor Mustangs. Hi, how are you? Good, good, we're good, ranked number one in the state again, happy about that. Oh, congratulations. Thank you, sir, well, listen, I'll cut to the chase, I'm moving up to athletic director next year and I'm looking for a cross country coach to replace me. I've been looking at your program there for a long time, always been impressed, and I'd like you to come visit us here. Yo, your mom's on the phone. I'm not here. Come on, bro, it's your mom. Hey, mom. You know I love you, right? Mom, I can barely hear you. I found your dad's information, gonna send it to you. My, my dad? - I - love you very much. Mom, what? You're my only man. Mom, mom? Mom! Jeremy? It's okay, you know, this is the house of God. You don't need to break into it. How'd you know I was here? Well, it's our job to know things, son. Don't forget to lock up. Hey, what's up? Hey. So, where are we heading? You never let up, do you? Well, I'll see you at school. Oh, I was gonna walk you home. Sorry, cowboy, no boys pass the stop sign. Yeah, I'm not very good at following rules. I can tell. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Bye. Stretch out those shoulders, extension, flexion. How's everybody doing in school, good? - Good. - I'm not gonna hear about how you're falling behind? No, Coach. Turn in your homework? Yes, Coach. Oh, hi, Jay, what time you got? I assume you're all warmed up since you're not stretching with the rest of us, is that right? Yeah. Ah, okay, good. Well, I guess you're gonna run well. Let's go, line up. So we got two new guys who're gonna get their wristbands, gonna represent. On my whistle. On set. Good effort. Good effort, Jay, good effort. Grab some water, get ready for the next lap. What? I said grab some water, get ready for the next lap. I just ran. Yeah, you ran the warm up lap. You got three more. Grab some water. Stupid. All right, guys, come on. That right? Let's go. On my whistle, runners set. Good job, how're you doing? What's going on. Run another lap, how you doing? You okay? Give me your best effort? - Yeah. - That's all I ask for. Don't worry about them. You wanna go again? Yeah. I'll run this one with you. Come on. You okay? Yes, it's hard to breath sometimes. Jay, come on buddy, wake up. Let's go. Get over here. Please. Hey, how's it going? So, Jay, I hear you're from Lubbock. I lived in Lubbock for two years, I went to Tech. It was pretty cool. Um, the, the sand storms are crazy out there. I'm originally from Houston, so it was definitely a culture shock when I came here, for sure. You can force me to come here, but you can't make me talk to you. That's all right, just sit and hang out. We'll talk when you're ready. Boo! What ya doing? Homework, how 'bout you? I'm about to go feed the horses. You wanna come? Yeah. You like horses? Yeah, who doesn't? This is Buttercup. Yeah, she's pretty. And this is Stranger. Nice. This is Dash, but I call her Starlight. I don't know, I just like it better. Do you wanna feed one? Yeah, of course. Here. Keep your hand flat. There you go. You're a natural. Yeah, thanks. And that's Goldie, by the way. She'll be at the prairie ride. Hey, Goldie, me, you, tomorrow. Got it? You're the man. Will you be there? Maybe. Okay. Okay, guys, when we get to the gate it's an invitation to grand silence. Now grand silence is not about being quiet, it's about being still. It's about looking inside yourself, and letting go of whatever burdens you have. Now when we get to the edge of the world, there'll be another invitation to take those burdens and lay them down before God. Now adjourning scripture is Matthew 11:28 through 30. Jesus said, "Come unto me all you who are weary "and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest. "Take my yoke upon you "let me teach you, for I am humble and gentle in heart, "and you will find rest for your souls. "My burden is easy, my yoke is light." Shh. Represent. Represent. Represent. Goal posts. Represent. Hey, Coach. Represent. Excuse me, Mr. Purple Shirt, come back here. You, come on. Go, hustle back, jog back. I was pacing myself. Uh huh, does this mean you would like to join the team? Yeah. Yes, Coach. Yes, Coach. In that case, you show up on time, every time, not a half hour late. You listen to what I tell you, and you never quit, no matter how tough it gets. Understand? Yes, Coach. Good, my mailbox woke me up in the middle of the night on Tuesday. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Nah, nah, no. No, that's good. But I will find out who did it. Meanwhile, get on the line, you owe me three more laps. What? You owe me three more laps from last week, remember? Let's go. You're thinking way too much about your technique, Jay, relax. This isn't track. Try to run too straight up and down. That's better. Relax your hands, too tight. Good. Gotta stop thinking, don't think when you're running. There you go, that's better. That looks better. Remember this isn't track, it's cross country. Get out of my way, man, get off. So slow, get out the way. Oh, you're not about to beat me. Get outta my way, man. Hey, pace yourself we're on the same team. I finally got that horse smell off me. Yeah, it's not off, I can smell it from over here. I mean at least he doesn't look like his horse. You could be your horse's twin brother. At least I live here and wasn't sent here. All right, none of that. You don't know anything about me. I don't belong here. That's what they all say. I don't belong here, I didn't do anything. If you didn't do anything then why are you here? You wanna start something? That's enough! I don't wanna hear this, I don't want bickering. I want support. Dwight, you've been here for two years. What are you talking about? You know better than that. That's not what this place is about. If you guys put as much energy into running as you do bickering with each other, we might win a race. Speaking of which, this scrimmage tomorrow, it's gonna be a challenge. It's 3.1 miles, and it's against Brentmoor. Brentmoor. Yeah, Brentmoor High School, defending AA state champions. Are they fast? Yeah, they're fast. They beat a couple of AAAA teams outright last year. Good. I think we can beat 'em. In fact, I'm sure we can beat them if we work as a team. But I can't tell if we're a team. Are we a team? Yes, Coach. I didn't hear you. Yes, Coach. I didn't hear Dwight, I didn't hear Jay. Are we a team? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah what? Yes, Coach. All right, let's eat. Who wants to lead us in prayer? - Why don't you go ahead, Will. - Me? Jay, don't. Um, dear Lord, Willy here. Thanks, amen. Amen. Hey, you, pass the crackers. Yeah, come on, pass the crackers. Yeah, thanks. Who taught you to eat? I guess my dad. Well. He's a trucker. There's more popcorn on the floor than in the bowl. Geez, the last time I invite you to my house. Yo, Coach! Yo, Willy. Why you got this big house and you live in this corner? Bring me that box by your feet. Yeah, sure. Don't look inside. I told you not to look inside, didn't I? All right, it's official now. Ah, sweet! What are these? William. Aw, dude, it even smells good. Ha, got it. Represent. Yeah, we need to change that word. I can help you. Three, four, five. One, two, three, four, five. Go take your warmup. Coach, how you doing? Good, and you? I'm good. Hey, boys, you all go warm up. Yes, sir. Hey, did you get my offer? I did, I did. Wow, it's really generous, thank you. There's a lotta guys interested in this job, but I want you. You know, make that call. Well, I certainly am flattered. Thank you very much. Well, let's get after it. Okay, let's do it. - All right. - See you down there. Set. Oh, you gonna sprint this out? Jay, pace yourself. Good luck, buddy. Come on, come on, come on. What are you doing? Get away from me, ugh! I'm sorry is the finish line right there? Where's the finish line? Dwight, where's the finish line? Come on. Why did you not run through it? Are you injured? Did you not see what happened back there? Yes, you quit running! I tripped, he tripped me! Oh, well, gosh I hope you don't trip in a real race because then we'll just give up, how 'bout that? Hit the showers, you too. Why don't you run back to the showers? Hustle! Okay, guys, we've got a long way to go before we can compete with schools like Brentmoor. They're experienced, they're focused, and they're very well coached. Are they as well coached as we are? And they don't beat themselves, Dwight. All right, let's warm up. One lap around the pond, and then we're gonna do some drills. Let's go, get at it. Jay, Dwight, come here. I don't know what's going on with you two, but it gets worked out today. We're gonna win, we're gonna win as a team. It means out there, we gotta have each other's backs. So get up there and work it out. Up where? Finally, dude. man, this is fun. No, I like it up here. Hey, maybe you should ruin our meets more often, so we can come out here. Aw, what, you silent now? Are you just mad 'cause I'm faster than you? In fact, next meet, I'm gonna run backwards, so I can beat you while running backwards. Oh, hold up, nah, I'm not gonna do that 'cause I don't wanna see your ugly face when I win. Get out here to the middle, and let's get this over with. I'm coming, come now. All right, help me across. Come on, hey. Hey, man, what you doin'? What you doin'? I'm not doing anything. Yeah, you are, you're shaking the pole. I'm not shaking the pole. That's exactly what you're doing. You have to lean back more. I'm leaning, I'm leaning. Oh, geez, you're face is even uglier up close. Hey, Dwight, what was that? Coach, this guy's crazy. Mom, what is coach's problem with me? What do you mean, did something happen? I do exactly what he wants me to do, but that's never good enough. He cuts Willy and Jay so much slack. I feel like I'd be better off if I had gotten in trouble. Hey, I don't wanna hear you talk like that. Too bad. Dwight. I'm done! Dwight! Hi, Debra, how are you? - What's going on? - What's going on with what? Dwight's upset. And I know him well enough to believe there's a good reason for it. Well, I understand your concern, but can we talk about it at a different time-- No, we can't, Mitch. - Now is not a very good-- - No! It's gonna be fine. Runners set, go. Oh, yeah, exactly. Now, stay on lane one. By the way, Sarah wanted me to invite you to dinner tonight. Tonight? I'm there. We were also thinking about inviting Debra. Absolutely not. It's been five years, Mitch. So five is the magic number? I didn't know there was a statute of limitations on grief. You're right, I'm sorry. So, big day tomorrow. It's the interview, right? Ah, I'm just gonna test the waters. Mitch, I've known you a long time. If you're going, it's more than just testing waters. Well, why shouldn't I go down there? I deserve to be happy. And these kids, every year there's a new crop, and you and I both know that they need our help, but none of them actually want it. I'm sick of it. I'm sick of them. Idiot. Where's Willy? He's not here. No kidding, where is he? He quit. Did he tell you that? Yeah. Okay. Hey, Jeremy. How you feeling? A little nervous. Yeah, so am I. So is everyone else. Listen, this course is built for you. It's flat, everything we worked on together. It's gonna work out for you here if you just trust yourself, okay? All right. All right, go get 'em. Thanks, Coach. Mm hmm. I love you, Jeremy. I knew this place was stupid. Stop it, Willy. Stupid Boys Ranch. Shut up, this place saved my life! Yeah, well, it ruined mine. There they are. Hey, Willy, we won second, silver medal, baby! You would've gotten first if I was there. Willy! Willy! Willy! Hey, Willy, get over here now. What's going on, what happened to you? Seriously, I'm just making it easy for you. Easy for what? Quitting. Quitting. Man, I heard you. I know you're taking another job. I know you're sick of this place, sick of me, sick of all of us. Sorry you had to deal me. Hey, wait, don't walk away from me. I didn't know you heard that, I'm sorry. You did hear right, I am considering another job next year. This year, right now, I've got this job, and I'm gonna finish it. That has nothing to do with quitting. Man, whatever. I've never quit anything that I've started before, ever. Can you say the same thing? Is this how you're gonna live your life anytime someone says something you don't like? Anytime someone offends you, you're just gonna say I'm, I'm out, I'm finished? 'Cause it's gonna happen a lot in life, I'll tell you that. Have people quit on you before? I think they have, but I'm here to tell you that I am never gonna quit on you, ever. Man, I don't care. Don't you? Why'd you paint that wall then? Man, you think an awful lot of yourself. I tagged 57 walls in L.A., was that all about you, too? No. No, that's about you. Mr. Tibbe, this is Debra Everett. And, uh, I know that you've been missing your appointments. If there is anything that we can do to help you, will you please call me. Hey, Dad, did you get that picture I sent? I wish you would call me. I mean, maybe you have called and I missed it. You could email too, but probably can't figure out how to work the computer. Anyway, Ms. DeMarco says I should mail you a letter, so, uh, here it is. I'm doing all these stupid activities to keep me from dying of boredom. I mean, I'm so far ahead of the students here, I rarely make it to class on time. I mean, why should I? Ms. Everett signed me up for some science club. It's probably boring too. I know I made it hard on you sometimes, I guess hard on myself, too. But don't give up on me. Anyway, I wish you were here. Drive safe, love you. Does this rocket work? Of course it works. How high does it go? 18,000 feet. What? What? Yep. I heard you're not going to the rocket launch. Oh yeah, who'd you hear that from, Debra? Hey, check this out. It's the offer from Brentmoor. That's a lot of money. I know. You never cared about the money before. Well, I've never been offered that much before. Sounds like a done deal. What? I didn't say anything. Yeah, I know you didn't say anything, but I know you too well. Just because you don't say anything, doesn't mean you don't have an opinion. What? I'm asking you. Well, if you're asking me, okay. I think you're wrong about the kids, and you know it. They do want our help, Mitch. Yes, we lose some, and it hurts. But Jesus said in the book of Matthew, "A shepherd that has a hundred sheep, if one goes astray, he'll leave the 99 and go after the one that got lost." That's what we do. And again, since you're asking, I think you're lost. I think you're living in fear. Now if you're too blind to see what's right in front of you, if you have lost that ability, then yes, maybe you need to move on. Well, that's the last time I ask you for your opinion. Do you ever lose faith? Faith, you mean faith in God? No, I mean faith in the work you're doing. Faith in this place? Faith in people, I guess that's what I mean. Well, I would consider a loss of faith in people equivalent to a loss of faith in myself, and in God. I believe in the inherent good in all people. It's just an expression of the love of God. And everything else, all the shakenings and the doubts? They're just tests of that love. Yeah, I just feel like, uh, I feel like I'm failing all the test, you know? Well, welcome to the party, we all do. Mitch, everything you do here, it means everything to these kids. Well, I hope you're right, I really do. So how's things going with you and Debra? Mitch: I have faith in it. You have faith? Hi, there. Hey. Hey, is Dwight here? I'd like to speak to him, if I could. Yeah, come on in. Thanks. Come in. Hey, Dwight. How are you? Can I talk to you a second? Talk. Well, I tell you've, uh, you've noticed that I have not been the best coach this year. And I need help, sometimes even coaches need help. I was wondering if you could do me the favor of helping me out with the team? You know, um, maybe you could run some of the captain's practices yourself? Take the roll of a leader, even a bigger leader than you already are. Why me? Well, you have the most experience, you know the terrain better than anybody, and frankly, you require the least amount of coaching of anybody on and off the course. What do you say? Okay. - Yeah? - You got it, Coach. Great. And a great favor to me, thank you. You could also, you know, help out with the laundry. I'm kidding. I'll see you. Thanks, Mitch. I know he needed that. Were you eavesdropping? He is my son, you know. Mitch: He's a great kid. Yeah, he is. I needed it too. Good. Yeah. I, uh, oh, well. I'll, I'll see you. Okay. You going to the rocket launch? Oh, yeah, yeah, I wouldn't miss it. Good, I'll see you there. - Okay. - Okay, bye. Bye. That's 2:20 right there. That's a good job, that's an improvement from last time, isn't it? Well done, it's a good pace. Good effort, guys, keep it up. What's up? This is gonna be cool. That's it, you got it turned on. Insert tiny screws. Pretty boring this weekend. Yeah. You gonna do anything next weekend? I don't know. Now let's get the radio tuned in. I don't plan ahead much. Take this out. And we've got a beacon inside the nose cone. Oh, do you like rockets? Yeah, what about you? Sure, yeah. Okay, rocket's ready to launch, Charlie. Five, four, three, two, one. I'm sorry, I'm not very good at this. At what? Just sitting still without, you know, filling the space with words or, or movement. Would you rather go for a walk instead? No, no, no. I think being still is not gonna hurt me, right? No, not at all. It's totally exhausting though. You know, there's nothing that you have to do, nothing you have to accomplish, not right now. And especially, not with me. Thank you. Right now you're running like you've been told one too many times to keep your chest out and your head over your hips. Those are all fine things, good cues, but nobody runs straight up and down, 'kay? You look fine, I just want you to relax a little bit. Mitch, can I see you a second? Man, I don't think we're gonna be cool. Jeremy, why don't you go talk to the chaplain. Go join the others. Coach, what happened? Just go ahead. What's up? Look son, there's no easy way to tell you this, but I'm sorry, look. This is how you answer my prayers? All I've asked for is for you to take care of her, and this is what you do? Jeremy, look, I know it doesn't make sense sometimes. I didn't come here for a sermon. Okay, if that's what you're here to do, then you can take these back. I didn't come to preach at you. I came to say I'm sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry too. I'm sorry my mom was an alcoholic and a crackhead. I'm sorry she thought a car was a good home. And that it was okay to get dinner out of a trashcan. Hey, dad, I mean, um, Mr. Harris. What can I do for you, Jeremy? Um, I'm just calling to let you know that, um, mom died today, just thought you should know. I'm sorry to hear that, but I'm not surprised. She had a, I guess you could say she had a hard life. So you live in Chicago? I do. So what do you do. Look, Jeremy, I'm sorry about your mom, but I gotta go, good luck. All right, listen up guys. We've been to the Lubbock regions before, you know how it works. It's a little warm today, but that's all right. We've got the Falcons coming, they're on the up and coming, but that's all right. Rough Riders, we know about them. Hey, I need to talk to that coach. Hey, you guys warm up for a minute, all right? Coach! Be right back. Hey, how are you? Good. Good. Congratulations on your season, you've made something out of nothing one more time. Thanks. Hey, give us a call. Yep, that's the guy that's trying to steal coach. Coach wouldn't leave. Money changes a lot of things. Yo, D, check it out, it's team orphan. Hey, hey, it's boy's camp, right? It's Boys Ranch All right, same thing, whatever. Is it true what they say about you guys? That Father's Day is the hardest time of the year 'cause none of you know who your parents are? You got a problem? Got something to say, tough guy? Say it, tough guy. Yeah, that's what I thought. I will destroy you! Jeremy, calm down, hey, calm down. Save it for the race, Jeremy. Jeremy, what's going on? Hey! I'm outta here. Jeremy! It wasn't his fault. What wasn't is fault? - It was that Brentmoor kid. - He was standing up for him. He was only standing up for Jay. He was talking trash. What happened? Jeremy punched him in the face. Jeez. Come here, come on. Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please. Boys Ranch competitor number 1351 has been disqualified for unsportsmanlike conduct. Chad, pace. All right boys, come on. According to your grandma, you quit everything you do. You always give up. This how you're gonna live the rest of your life? Go Jay, go! It's Boys Ranch! Coach Andrews, hey, uh, what was all that stuff before the race? We're just playing by the rules, Coach. I mean, what your boy said to mine before the race? Did you hear it? Yeah, I heard it. Boys will be boys. So you approve of that sort of thing? I approve of winning. If you don't wanna win as bad I do, maybe working together is not such a good idea, Davis. It sounds like maybe you and I have a different idea of what winning is. Well, maybe we do. Well, this is life in the fast lane, Coach. You're either in or you're out. I'll see you at state. This year and next. All right, look at you guys, huh? How you feeling? Thank you. Well, done, that's a great effort, great effort. Look at you, huh? Well done. Woo, how you feeling? Guys , all right, let's get on the bus. Hey, hey Coach, I blew up your mailbox, sorry. I know, come on, let's go. Whoa, come on, guys, that's what I'm talkin' about. Good job, bubba. Thanks, man. Just gonna leave me hangin'? Hey, man, I just, uh, wanna say thanks for gettin' my back today. Dude, Jeremy did most of the work. Hey, Jeremy, thanks, man. Hey, Jay, how's that personal best feel? Feels good, I just, uh, kinda wish my dad was here to see it. Yeah, so do I. Man, this stop sign again? This stop sign is stupid. It's not stupid to me. My mother had me when she was 15, and here I am. I like the stop sign. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, I didn't know, I'm sorry. I'm leaving in two weeks, Willy. What, why, where are you going? My mother wants me back. We're moving to St. Louis, or outside of St. Louis, but we Skyped for like two hours. And how is this good news? Aren't you happy for me? Happy for you? Why does everybody have to do this to me? I'll still be here for state. I can still see you run. I'm not running anymore. I was only running for you. Father, bless this food. Thank you for the nourishment it provides. As we enjoy this meal and after, help us to be mindful of the needs of others, amen. Do you know what one of your best qualities is, Jeremy? You always try to do the right thing. I didn't do the right thing. No, no, you didn't. And though I admire your courage, I can't condone violence. It's a path that leads to pain and unhappiness. I think you've had enough of both. I could've kept hitting him. I wanted to keep hitting him. If they hadn't pulled me off, I would have. It scared me. It should scare you. I don't see myself that way, Chaplain. That's the flesh in all of us. And we could feed it with anger and fear, or we can quench it with love and compassion, but it's there. Is it in you too? We're all made of the same stuff, but it's our choice who we become. It's not who you are, or where you've been, it's where you're going that counts. I can't tell you how proud I am of all of you. When you get out there on that course, and you get tired, I want you to remind yourself how far you've come. If you guys run with a purpose in your heart, if you give every ounce of your strength, you're already champions. Subtitles by explosiveskull
