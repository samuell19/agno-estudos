THE WILD SOCCER BUNCH 4 THE ATTACK OF THE SILVERLIGHTS Lightning and thunderdust! What a year that was! Maxi, who kicks harder than anyone, was my brother. And we'd beaten everyone! We were ready for the big final. We were ready to win the cup! The Freestyle Soccer Cup Contest that takes place tomorrow at Ragnarök, in the legendary Wolves' fortress, from which no one has ever returned. No one! All is well and good. - As long as you're wild. Where are the others? - We're here! Of course we are. And if you can sleep till midday, you can also help out. He wasn't asleep. He was looking for his pants. Ha ha! What do we need that for? - For Mr. Top. - And Mr. Secret. We're inventors. - Didn't you know? Ragnarök lies at the end of the world. Behind Thunder and the Adder's Cave. Here. At the forest's furthest corner, on the border of Nothing. On the border of what? By the pus of Never-Neverland! I bet you're all wetting your pants. And if you're not, then the Wolves certainly will, when we turn up on these monsters. Markus built them. If you're very nice to him, you'll get a machine from hell of your own. And the first one's mine! - Stop! Not like that, boys! They're not for free. We have to buy them. Here! With this I vanquished Fat Micki, Gonzo Gonzales and the Beastly Beasts. That's a lot. Not for one of your bikes. Here! Leon gave this to me when he was 3 years old. The Witch's Eye of Staraja Riba. The Joker-X of the 7th Cavalry. I'll give you all that I cherish. And that I, too, cherish. And that which bonds us. My five star-stones. "Forever... wild." Are you sure? - I swear by my legs I am. Okay. It's a deal. By star-spangled dragon slime! But Markus, one's missing. I know. You're too small. What? - You're too small for a motorbike. But... - I'm sorry, but... you'll ride this! Raban and I built it. And this is what you're to wear. Do you like them? Let's go! Let's go win that cup! The cup of cups! Ready, brother? - Wolves, here we come! Ragnarök, here we come! Watch out, Wolves! Here comes the Wild Soccer Bunch! We're off to Ragnarök! We're off to Ragnarök! Now we're off! We'll win that cup! Step on the gas! Ragnarök, here we come! FreestyleSoccer Contest! The cup of all cups! The final's on! Yeah, a soccer bonanza! Watch out, Wolves! Here comes the Wild Soccer Bunch! We're off to Ragnarök! Watch out, Wolves! Here comes the Wild Soccer Bunch... Stop! They're all asleep. They're already in bed! Then we'll have to wake them. Nerv! With pleasure, Leon. Truly sorry, cutesy-tootsy Wolves. But destiny commands me. Now! Stink bomb cannons! And silverfish mortars! The little beasts are already licking their slimy lips. Worse! It's an evil brew of lice and roaches. Mad mayhem! I'm too old for this. - I know I am! Hello, Erik! It's me! Leon the slalom-dribbler! And I'm Marlon, his brother, number 10! We've come to play soccer. - But if you're wetting your pants, we'll go home this instant! Did you guys hear that? Here's a Wild Soccer Bunch of cowards! Say that again and I swear: I'll show you the sideways flying volley steamhammer booster! Then I guess we have no choice! Open up! I don't know. But they're very afraid of something. I swear by my legs on it. - A pity they're not afraid of us. Hey, Erik! I believe I like your Ragnarök already. And even more when we win tomorrow. Hey, I was only joking. You're allowed to laugh! Come on, let's set up camp. It'll be dark in an hour. Ragnarök, you god-forsaken backwoods! Raban, Joschka, I need power! One moment! - Almost done. - Tinkerbell, firefly and starry bear. By almighty Top and Mr. Secret! Unfortunately it won't last long. - What? We may starve, do you hear? - What's up? Will we or won't we eat? - Of course we will, right away. I've some popcorn-pizza-candy. Ham-salami and Hawaii pizza. And you can choose what you'd like to drink. Raban's and Joschka's latest invention. Soda with whatever flavor you wish for. That works? - Check it out. - Just close your eyes and rub the label. - Okay. I wish for... marshmallow... Smartie... and jelly-bear soda. You see? - Now you have to drink it. It's good. Hey, Erik, you want to try it? Or do you want a pizza first? No, thanks. I want to talk to Leon. - Okay. We're all ears. I mean in private. Sorry, Erik. We're all one team. - I know. And you should stay a team. As you like. But I'll take another pizza with me, okay? It's very nice here. Why don't we stop for a picnic? What do you know about Ragnarök? Nothing. I've never heard of it. Hey, I was only joking, Erik. You are the champs. You won the Freestyle Contest 3 times and have the biggest cup ever! The very cup we'd like to win. Which is why we'll kick you to the world's end tomorrow. - And what will you do then? Leon, Ragnarök is the world's end. Come with me. Well? Do you believe me now? The mist descends every year before the cup final. And it draws closer every night. Every night? I get it. And it claims whoever wins. No. Not the mist. That which lives beyond it. Awicked, hairy monster, right? No, Leon. Only a girl. But she'll destroy all you cherish. So why tell me all this? Because you're like me. I don't want you to suffer as I did. I don't like this, Maxi. - Tronje! Run! Close the gates when Leon returns and double the watch. - Creepier and creepier. Oh! It's only me, Limpet! No one gets rid of me. - Well, get you! Tell her I don't talk to girls. - I'm not a girl! She's not a girl. - Yeah, sure! And I'm the Emperor of China. Oh! Hello, Emperor! Hey! She said, "Hello, Emperor!" Like I said, "No one gets rid of me." She said... Vanessa! - Okay! I'm off, Your Majesty! It will be a pleasure to beat you tomorrow! Oh! Excuse me. So, what did Erik want? Leon? What's up? No secrets, huh? You're right. He tried to scare me. But really, he's just afraid... ...of losing tomorrow. What's up? Come on, let's hit the sack! Or you want to miss the big game? What shalll do now? Aml risking everyone and everything? A pity no one can tell me the answer. I have to risk it. I'll never chicken out. Tonight is the big night. Bythe waning of the moon, the onlything that counts, is thatyou trust me... What did Erik say? ... when you look at me... No matter whatl decide... He said, if we win tomorrow, it's all over. My heartis with you... Over between us too? I don't know. Do you want me to lose on purpose? Gordian-knotted midnight knots! What is this? It's still dark. - Wakey, wakey, sleepy-head. Here. Freshen up. Or we'll kick you out, stinkpot. Don't make me laugh! Awild boy never stinks. Awild boy perspires. He glows. D'you hear? - And wears his pants as a hat. - What are you after now? - I can't help how I am. Aren't your legs cold? - What if they are! I won't talk with you. You're a girl! I'm not. No more than you are. I can see that. Intergalactic Never-Neverland! I thought you didn't talk to girls. Hey! - What do you want? - Your underpants. How I hate that! Hey, Erik. As you see, here we are. And we will beat you, no matter how much mist shrouds Ragnarök. Erik, the Silverlights! Stay put! What are you afraid of? I came alone. Leon, who is it? Who is it? Cat got your tongue? I came especially to see the contest... And all I see is a bunch of speechless boys! By the adder's triple-forked tail! - Wait! I'll ask you one more time, Leon! Will you fight? Or go home? Remember the mist and all that I told you. - Okay. You already know my answer. I am like you. Then the dice have rolled. Coyote Karl-Heinz! Did you all hear that? Greet our opponents! Greet the world's wildest Soccer Bunch. And now, listen to me. Today, everything is at stake. Today... will change your lives forever. Today, not only will Nerv's world be turned upside-down. For he who wins today, wins everything. This year's Freestyle Soccer Contest. And, yes... also... of course... the cup! The cup, the cup, the cup... Well? Do you want it? Yes! - Yes! There are 4 solo rounds, which you hopefully know. The sideways volley target shot. You're playing against me. - No! You are. And I will beat you! The test for the world's hardest kick, the relay penalty duel and the hanging slime-bag slalom race. You'd better lose that. Each victory is worth 2 points. If you draw, the points are shared, and the result carried over into the final round: The crucial decisive round. Which will, as always, whether fair or not, be played with all the mean cunning of the Wolves. Do you accept? Dumb question! That's what Freestyle is. - But now you're in Ragnarök. Seems like you prefer talking to playing soccer. Nerv is up first. Nerv kicks off for the Wild Soccer Bunch. We have to win all the solo rounds. - Yeah, or we don't stand a chance. Hey, Nerv, you can do it! - With one hand behind your back! Sure, she's just a girl. Talk to my foot about that! - You have 15 seconds. Triple-oiled pus-plague! Nerv, up there! On the tree! Leon! - Go! - Go, little brother! Your brother, yeah! D'you hear? I'm Maxi's brother. - Here! The brother of the hardest-kicking guy in the world. - The other tree! Yes! - You can do it! - Nerv, on the platform. Yeah! - Yeah, that was good! - Number two. Now up on the tower! Yes! - Super, Nerv. Great! - Here. - 3! And the fourth is on the wall. Yes! - You did it! - 4 in 15 seconds. - Hot! She'll never beat that. Never. - No way! As I said, she's just a girl. My foot will do the talking. Coyote Karl-Heinz! Now! - And she's off! One... Two... Three... - Now two at once, Limpet! Four... and five! Well? I told you so. Five hits! - So, the Wolves have... - Two points! And the Bunch has how many? None! Leon? - Hey, it can happen to anyone. Come on! Maxi is sure to even the score! You'll have legs of jelly when I'm through with you. Inky-sulferous forest window crap. That was more than one Mach. That was more than supersonic. Enjoy yourself! Thanks, I shall. Maxi! It's only a game. It's okay to lose. Yes! - But to win is even better! The world's hardest kick ever! The score is two all. - Now Markus'll win the next 2 points. Get ready for the relay penalty duel! Here, this one's for you! It's ours! Markus! Markus! Markus! - Markus! Markus! - Markus! Markus! - Markus! Markus! Markus! Geliad! It's yours, Markus! Yeah! - And the score? The Bunch has... Four! - And what about the Wolves? Two! And Vanessa'll take care of the rest. Won't you now? On your marks! Vanessa, I'm counting on you! If a slime-bag should hit you, you've already lost. Don't forget! If you want to keep Leon, you'd better lose. Vanessa, the slime-bag! You can do it, Vanessa! Faster! You're catching up! - Watch out! Yes, Vanessa! Run, Vanessa! Run! Yes, you can do it! Run, you've got her! Go! - You're ahead! Great, Vanessa! Now back again. You're halfway there, Vanessa! Vanessa, run! You're faster! Faster than her! Vanessa, yes! You can do it! It's in the bag! I'm counting on you! No! - Vanessa, do you want us to lose? What are you up to? Vanessa? Yes! Four all! Come on, Leon. Let's go. Vanessa! You did it! I wish I'd lost on purpose a year ago. Four all. Take a rest! The game begins in one hour! Raban! Joschka! I need your help. Here's the pitch. The goals are here and here. And all around and between them, Coyote has buried fat surprises. Like at Adders' Cave? - Or Thunderbolt? No, even worse this time. The Wolves won 3 times, though they were 8 points down after the solo rounds last year. Can you do it? Build something that'll take the Wolves by surprise? Hang on, it'll take a moment. I'll fetch the Invent-o-Mat. Only 50 minutes to go. 48, to be precise. Raban! I know. But if we hurry, the machine will be just perfect. Joschka, come on! Wait a moment! If anyone else is planning to lose, he'd better say so right now. Okay. Now I know where we're at. Leon! You gave us your answer already! Oh yeah? And do you know why? 'Cause I also saw something! Okay, Joschka. We need an ironing board, a lamp and our old frying pan. Now I know what to call you. I'll call you Horizon. Are you love-struck? - Pardon? - Are you or aren't you? Get outta here! He's no idea what you're talking about. Okay, then I'll ask him instead. He's love-struck too, already. Isn't he, Vanessa? Ready, Raban? Joschka? You bet we are! - We're almost done. We had to improvise a bit. Its only disadvantage is... it will only work one time. What? Well, that's great. Without a frying pan, we'd be lost. It's not a frying pan. - As I said. All is well and good. As long as you're wild. - Be wild. - Dangerous and wild. One, two, three! By the secret pillow-sucker! And now she's back again! Raban! I see cannons, trip-wires, net-traps and those bullets up there have a reinforced-steel core. Turn the wheel! The wheel of fate! For that will tell us, what the final score shall be. It's four all now. If the wheel stops at 9, time's not an issue. You can study our traps all day long. But if it stops at 5... tough luck! Oh! Now the first goal will be decisive. The Golden Goal in the Freestyle Soccer Contest. Which starts now! Markus! The cannons! Fly, Markus! Yes! - Run! Tronje! - Markus, it's yours! Now Maxi! Run! - But he won't get far. - Erik! One! Two! - Run! Stop him! Three! - Leon's free! And now we attack! Freya, Tronje is free! Maxi to Erik! Marlon to Run! I'll cover Tronje! Now! - Take it away, Erik! - Maxi! - Shoot, man! Marlon, this one's yours! - Run's not covered! Yes! Great one, Markus! - Leon, watch out! Don't let him shoot! No! - Hurry! Yes! - I love you, Nerv! - Yes! We love you too! - Now we'll show 'em. Maxi, Marlon! Coyote! - No fear, it's in the bag! Leon, the knockout-crusher! It's right behind you! - Leon, watch out! He won't make it. Raban! The net-traps! - Leon! The net-traps! Yes! So? What will you do now? You can't shoot any goals now. The net is blocking our goal. - Erik, this one's for you! No, it's Maxi's! - Raban, Joschka, hurry! The frying pan! - It's not a pan! - Whatever. Go, Maxi! Hold the thing as tight as you can! - It's not a thing either! This is the world's first portable tractorized-laser-beam ball-catapult! That's wicked! No! - I said we're not finished. - Joschka's right! Get up, Giliad! We're not finished yet! Yes! - Yes! That was the fifth! - We've won, Maxi! Yeah! - Yeah! We won the Freestyle Soccer Contest! Now the cup is ours! Here, brother mine. Yes! - Yes! Right. I am like you, Erik! We're going to party! - Come on over! We'll celebrate together! What about you? Leon and I would be glad... - Leon and who? Hey! Where are you going? Horizon! Wait! Horizon! Horizon? That's what I call you. Like the sunrise, you know? And longing. The longing for what lies beyond it. Horizon, come on. We won. Yes, I saw you. We won it all. We're the champs. Wow, I see. Then you're surely good enough to beat me too. Let's check it out. It's child's play. Nothing to it. So, your turn now. What is it? Or should I ask him to play for you instead? I told you. They're love-struck. Well, obviously you haven't won everything yet. Decide whether to hide, as the Wolves do, or whether you dare... I'll wait for you, Leon and... Marlon. I'll wait for you, beyond the mist. Beyond the mist! But be warned. I won't be alone! Forget her. Celebrate, then go home. She's out of your league. Really? What do you know? - Erik! You promised. You said you'd warn them. Coyote Karl-Heinz! Tell what they don't want to hear! Should I, really? What do you think, Nerv? I... I... I don't know. But you should know! For if I tell, the party will be over and all was in vain. And this cup is as worthless as your frying pan. It wasn't a frying pan. - Perhaps not, this side of the mist. Get on with it! Okay. As you like. One year ago... 12 moons and twice 12 victories ago... We won the Freestyle Soccer Contest for the third time. Then the Silverlights appeared from out of the mist. Yes, Marlon! Horizon is one of them. Not that she has a name, actually. She has no name because horror has no name. Yet Erik and Jaromir followed her nevertheless. Erik, our leader, and his older brother, Jaromir. They were both in love with her. But only one of them ever returned. He lay one morning at the gates of Ragnarök and his memory was a blank. This is all that remains and will always remain! This is the fate of all, who lose against the Silverlights! "Loser, Traitor". What about Jaromir? What happened to your brother? We do not know. We know only this: Beyond the mist, everything ends. Can we talk? About what? And you? What will you do? What d'you think? We're leaving. - Holy Thunderbird! You gave up once before. Remember? When we played the national team. Okay. I hope you still have your cowboy-suit. And you, your pom-pom costume! Man, he's totally love-struck! He's no idea what he's up to. - He's not accountable, Leon! You're all just chicken! What do you want from me? I want you to stay. Hey, Leon, the Silverlights don't belong to our world! Then why were they here? They challenged us. And tattooed a cross on Erik's chest. - Yes! Loser. Traitor. Is that what you want? We shall see. But why? We won. We'll win next year too. We're the champs! We're not. Horizon's better. Leon, I beg you. I love you. - That why you lost on purpose? - Leon! No! If I chicken out now, I'll no longer be true to who I am. And neither will any of you! Okay. But when you return, nothing will ever be the same again! Say, what happens to a relay man when he loses? Terror-touristic coffin-lid nail! "When you toss and turn all night, this magic drink will see you right". Hadji bin Hadji's "Choco-Courage", the best... ...cocoa in the world. Where'd you get that? - I saved some. Oh, man! Then you've had it for ages. - Yes. Since we played the national team. Right. Do you remember? Hadji wanted to comfort us. To comfort us because... Because Leon had disappeared? Do you think he's also love-struck? None of your business. Darn it! It's none of your business! Hey, little brother! What's up? Do you want to go home? There she is. What did I say? She's the horizon. And she's waiting for me! Y'know, Leon, the end of the world is the best place there is. Hello, Horizon. As you see, here we are. And we're not afraid. - Not even a teeny-weeny bit. I don't believe you! It looks to me as if you're about to pee in your pants. At least you, Marlon! I'm sorry. We're not used to playing with dolls! We only play soccer. So, where's the game? Everywhere, Leon. Wherever you like! You see, on this side of the mist we don't play on a pitch. We don't play at all, Leon! We take things very seriously. Or did Erik not show you the tattoo on his chest? But first, you must find me! Tronje, we're leaving! Where are you going? Hey, Erik, what's going on? Ragnarök now lies in your hands. - But where are you going? Home! And you should too. Forget Marlon! And you, forget Leon. Don't make the same mistake as me. You've already lost Leon to Horizon! I'll scout around. Perhaps I'll find something that'll help us decide. - Hey, wait! Markus! - We're coming too! Well? What's your name this time? Horizon. Like the horizon and everything beyond it. I know what a horizon is. Hey, Marlon! What's this about? I don't like this place. - I do. I can smell her, Leon. I can sense her. I'd find her even if she were a pin. Like a voodoo doll, huh? A pin? Avoodoo doll? More and more romantic. - Not jealous, are you? You had your chance, Jaromir. So when do we attack? Oh, come on. Marlon? - I don't know. Tonight, perhaps. No! I'm not going in there! It's too much like a horror movie. No, it's worse. It's for real. Then it's just what we were after. Who on earth lived in this place? That Coyote, no doubt. No! It was Jaromir's house. I told you you'd never get rid of me. Nor of that either. Now you know why you won. Without Jaromir, we were all useless. Yet he lost against the Silverlights. - I'm not so sure about that. I think Jaromir fought against Erik. - What? Ever imagine how Marlon feels? I mean, he's the older brother. Just like Jaromir. Yet his kid brother is the boss. It's he who gets the limelight, reaps all the praise. - And Jaromir gets the crumbs. Just like Marlon. "Erik and his brother conquer Ragnarök". "Erik and his brother are the champs". - "Erik's brother, the top scorer". Then along comes Horizon. And Jaromir falls for her, just like Marlon. But Erik won't stand for it. - Just like Leon. No way! Leon is with Vanessa. He wants to help Marlon! Are you sure about that? No! Limpet is right. Leon can't stand losing or being second-best. - And he's love-struck. Sly and sneaky steppenwolfs! Leon and Marlon are enemies. How about finding some firewood? Help out a little here. As you command, big brother. And then I'll massage your feet. Right! And hurry up. I'm hungry. I wish for... sunset-maracuja flavor. And I wish for... a crystal-clear lake. A lake worthy of your reflection. Hello, Leon! Fancy a dip? What's up? Are you afraid? Are you chicken? Come on. Come here. Forget your brother. I want the best guy, Leon. And you're the best. Or am I mistaken? We'll soon see. We'll see when we beat you tomorrow. Where've you been? Me? Nowhere. Did you go swimming? - Huh? I worked. And cooked. Raban and Joschka's latest hit: Wine-gums turned chicken-wings. Hey, what's eating you? Nothing. Nothing? Then everything's okay. Right. Have you ever wondered what happened to Erik and Jaromir? No. Why? I mean, they both loved Horizon. - What has that to do with us? I saw how she looked at you. Leon, you're my brother. Right. Forever. Darn! You can't force anyone to love you. Horizon will have to decide. What if she wants you? Tough luck for her, that's what! Hungry now? Is there any cocoa left? No, that was the last. Too bad. Darn! I don't believe a word he says, Maxi. Do you understand? Would you have left? 'Cause of Horizon? No. I'd never have left you. My God! I never knew. You were never meant to know. What shall we do now? I'm going home tomorrow, I don't want to be here when it all goes wrong. Darn! I never thought this'd happen to me. I always thought girls were stinkers. Even Vanessa. - Hey, watch your mouth, brother! But now, everything's changed. Now you're scared Horizon stinks. - Hey! That she has flakey and sweaty armpits. Or smells like... like hippopotamus propeller-tail manure and slimy, jiggly toilet-brush salad. All mixed-up! Say that once more! - Okay, as you like. Well, I'd say you took a dip today. May I ask with whom? Everyone here? Yes. We await your orders. So? How does she smell now? Okay, you win. But you have to tell me. Do you want to be with Horizon? Yes or no? - Now! Marlon, quick! Outta here! Hello, you two. I'd like to present your opponents! The choice is yours. We'll show mercy tonight, but if you're still here tomorrow, beware! Especially you, Leon! Or you'll share Erik's sorry fate! You're like him, aren't you? Where are you going? - Maxi? We're going home. - What? But why? - Because they're in love. I saw them last night. They were kissing. Maxi won Vanessa over. He's glad that Leon is gone. Is that true? - They ran away first! So now you dump them. - They're with Horizon! Take my advice. Come with us, or the Wild Soccer Bunch is finished forever. Just like the Wolves? They're finished too. They chickened out. Maxi! I thought you were my brother! You're a coward! You're both cowards! And so are you! - Perhaps. But I'll not wait here to find out. I'm going beyond the mist. That's the spirit! What are you waiting for? Yes, Markus is right! - Let's go! What's up? Turned to stone? That's my cart! - Right. And I'm the driver! Hey, stop! Hey, wait! Stop! That's my cart! Forget them. I'm sorry. I should never have lost. Then you must go. And you? Go! Thank you. And good luck. Good luck to you too. There she is. She knows we're coming. Jaromir! I believe that this time we've found two worthy challengers. We accept the compliment! And we've another surprise for you. We will beat you. The two of you? There are seven of us. Then get ready! As there are eight of us! - And no one will lose on purpose. On the contrary, Jaromir. - So, when and where do we play? Where's your stadium? - You're standing in it. We play cross-country. There, behind the forest, are the goals. You can choose one. Yet I warn you, Leon: Everywhere else, anything goes. Okay. When does it start? Tomorrow. The ball will be catapulted into the steppe at sunrise. And whoever shoots the first goal wins. Oh yes, I almost forgot one thing, Marlon. Before you join the losing team, you should ask your brother this. Where he was last night. At a moonlit forest lake, perhaps? What's up, Leon? And you, Vanessa, should ask him which of us he wants. I thought you were my brother! I trusted you. I think we've a new team member. At least one. And you, Marlon? Which side are you on? They'll never get over this defeat. Forget it! Not even the world's best cocoa will help you now. Dad? Who else? Expecting someone else? It's over. Great Ragnarök is sinking into the mist, and the Wild Soccer Bunch is finished. Right. Just as you'd always hoped. Are you satisfied at last? You made it. You know, Maxi... nothing lasts forever. Everything changes. Every moment, every second. Yet it never ends. Which means it gets even better. And bigger. So let's go home! Or are you going to run off and help your friends? Maxi, it's time to grow up. Can we talk? What's there to talk about? Vanessa, please. Don't react like Marlon did. Horizon was lying. I'm supposed to believe that? Oh, Vanessa, it was just a coincidence. I was fetching firewood. And there she was, alone in the lake. Forget your brother. I want the best, Leon. And of course you walked away. How dumb do you think I am? I saw how you looked at her. - And I still do. She's the strongest opponent I ever faced. And I admire her for that. I'm supposed to believe that? - Yes. But together, we can beat Horizon. I need you. Vanessa, we've already lost Marlon and Maxi. Not quite true. What's up? What are you waiting for? You want to end up like the Wolves? Or go home to Mom and Dad? Or shall we make a fantastically foolproof plan? Maxi's right. Let's move! We can beat them. No, we will beat them. And with their own weapons. Raban and Joschka, one of us must fly tomorrow. And land too, presumably? - And even survive it? Raban, I'm being serious. Okay. One moment. This could work. Nerv, we need your cart. What? Take every man you need. The rest come to the steppe with me. We'll dig two holes, here and here. And you? What do you want? It depends on you. You can decide. You can take revenge on your brother by defeating him. Or risk fighting against me. Like Erik? Yes. And like Leon, when he fights me tomorrow. But no one has ever beaten me. What's that? - The tattoo machine. The loser's punishment. And the traitor's. Think about it carefully. What about Jaromir? Why aren't you together? Jaromir defeated his brother. He chose revenge. Are you sure we'll win? - I'm never sure. But we'll do all we can. Here! You'll need this tomorrow. Come on! We'll all need this. Only this can help us. All that we cherish. Our treasures. Thanks, Markus. But I can't force anyone to stay. So whoever wants to leave should leave today. The rest come out to the steppe. We'll start out when night falls. When you left, Ragnarök sank into the mist. I don't want that to happen to us. That's why I came back. And because you and the Bunch are for me the most important thing in the whole world. And Leon feels the same. I swear by my legs on it. Well? Running away? No. I think I'll hide. I'll get in the hole. Maxi, where are the others? Gone. Just like you said. Why wait? Let's go beat them with their own weapons. Well, that's the only way. Their penalty area is mined with booby-traps. Flying's the only way through. Only this many left? There were eight of you! - What about you? I thought we'd begin at sunrise. Did you oversleep? We were waiting for somebody. Recognize him? He was once your brother, Leon! And he now has one goal only. To see you lose. That traitor! Can I tattoo the cross on his chest? He's your brother. He used to be. Maxi and Raban, go to the left. Markus comes with me. I've got it! - You've got it? Forget it! Get closer! - You're way too slow! - Maxi and Raban! Cover Horizon! - No chance! Today, you lose. Jaromir! Markus, stop Jaromir! I'll stick with Marlon! Jaromir to Horizon! - With pleasure, Marlon! Raban, Maxi! Don't let them get it! Darn it, Leon! The goal's wide open! In goal, Markus! I'll take care of Horizon! No, now Marlon's not covered! - Right. And this is for you! Maxi, you're not covering Marlon? That was your mistake, traitor! - Markus, where are you? I'm right here! - That won't help you! Markus, call Vanessa and Joschka! - Markus! - No, not yet! This'll be the goal of a lifetime! Markus! - Come on now! Vanessa! Joschka! Out of the hole! Go, Marlon! Shoot! Put it away! - Yes! That was brilliant, Markus! Maxi, to the right! Vanessa, watch out! Horizon! Come on, baby, do it! Markus, pass to Maxi, to the right! And now for some soccer! Maxi, forget the bikes! We're more agile on foot! And you step on the gas! Attack! Maxi, look out! Behind you! Vanessa, I'll drive round the left! Darn! Maxi needs help! Raban's free! - No! Pass to Joschka! Show him the world's hardest kick! Watch out! They're coming at you! Raban, spin those wheels! He needs your help! I'm right there! No, play to Leon. He's free! The game of all games! Now everything's at stake. Anything goes. No rules. Anything goes. The game of all games! Now everything's at stake. Foul! - The rules say, anything goes. Now I've beaten you twice. But only one man can win! - And it won't be you. Get used to losing, traitor! - You're the traitor! We have to stop them. Joschka, there's Horizon. Maxi, keep an eye on Jaromir! Pass, Marlon! Marlon, pass! Forget it! He never will! And he couldn't, even if he wanted to! Then I'll do it myself! How d'you like being second best and losing? - Leon, you can get him! What are you doing, Leon? - You want us to lose? I've already lost. Do you hear, Marlon? You're better than me. Only 'cause I'm playing without you. Don't listen to him! - The same goes for you too. Darn! Don't you feel it? Don't trust him. - Marlon... - He only wants to win! You're my brother. Without you, I've lost everything. But with you, they haven't a chance. And you can finally show her that you're the best. - Now run, Marlon! Run! Come on, you want to tattoo him. Now let's shoot the Silverlights to the moon. Show what you can do, Maxi! After it! - You stay there, Marlon! Markus, Marlon needs your help! You'll pay for this! - But only if we lose today. Jaromir! It's serious now. - Hurry, Markus! To Maxi! Get that ball! Run, Maxi! - Run for your life! The Wild Soccer Bunch is unbeatable! We play our game as a team! Leon, they're too many! I'm right here! Maxi! You can do it, Maxi! - Maxi, Leon is free! Faster than light! As wild as wild can be! Oh, can you feel the power? By hook or by crook! This is how it is, when the Wild Soccer Bunch plays soccer, when the Wild Soccer Bunch plays soccer. Together, we're unbeatable! The unbeatable Wild Soccer Bunch! Markus! Hurry, Markus! Remember! One of us has to fly! What? - Just shout for Limpet and Nerv! That won't help! Jaromir! Raise the spikes! Limpet, Nerv! Where are you? Here! Where else? Now the supports! - Now! Come on, Marlon! - Now cross it! Fly, Marlon! Fly! Yes! - Yes! - Yes! Did you see Marlon? - Yes, we did it! - It worked! Yes! - Yes! Darn, Leon! What a goal! - We thrashed them! We certainly did! He flew, Leon! - And landed too! - And survived! Fantastic, little brother! So? Are we good enough now for you to celebrate with us? Hey, Marlon. What's up? We won twice. We beat the Wolves and the Silverlights. - Yes. So here's the best our kitchen can offer. Our Surprise-Snack Lucky Bags! Just rip open the bag. Mmm! Spinach dumpling in tomato sauce. And I've brussel sprout-balls in herring aspic. Hey, it was only a joke. - And it wasn't too bad. Can we talk? In private, I mean. Darn! What are they doing? What d'you think? She's asking if she can come along. You did it. You did what no one ever could. You defeated me. You're the best, Marlon. You spurned revenge, and chose love. Or am I mistaken? Yuck! Puke and choke! And now I'll ask you? What? - If I can come along. Oh, no way! You're a girl. Are you quite sure about that? Of course! Hey! What are you doing? I'm peeing. That's no proof. Even Vanessa can do that. Then you'll have to take a look. - No chance. Ha, you don't have any choice! Or you want me to do what they did? Marlon? Horizon? Darn! Where are you? Holy apollo-calyptic blindworms! Leon, Maxi, Vanessa! Marlon's gone! She asked if she might come along. Do you think he's gone with her? Leon? We're leaving. It's about time. I thought I'd be here forever. What about Horizon? - She's coming too. And so is Limpet. All is well and good. - As long as you're wild. And that's how it should stay. What are we waiting for? That was the spirit! We left Ragnarök and the Silverlights behind us. And nothing stayed the way it was before. Behind every horizon lies a new horizon. And as long as we chase it, we shall always be wild! The world's end And all that lies beyond it, Is the most awesome place of all. The world's end Is the most awesome place of all. Come on, our journey's just starting. And this is the way. THE END Wild until the end of time Until the world's end I wantto be so wild, As wild asl like Wild until the world's end Until the end of time I wantto be wild, As wild asl like... I wantto go where the sun always shines... On the first day we beat The unbeatable victors. On the second day, Gonzo Gonzales And his skater-gang. On the third day it wasFadi And theBeastlyBeasts. On the fourth day, theRagnarök Wolves and theSilverlights... And now to Maxi. Maxi to Leon. He sees Marlon's free. A header. Goal! The Wild Soccer Bunch is again causing mayhem. Phenomenal, these guys. And great fun to watch. Ladies and Gentlemen! This is soccer at its best! Good morning! Or you want to see our biggest coffin? Yes! Oh, no! No! Yes? No, it's getting worse here. The Wolves have lost 3 times already. Did I say the wrong thing? - Yes. Joschka, we need an ironing board, a lamp and our old frying pan. The mist comes ethery... ...and the Adder's Cave. There, in the furthest corner of the... the secret forest and... Here, in the furthest corner, on the border to Nothing. Just rip open the bag. Mmm, I've tomato dumplings... And it works? - Check it out. Just close your eyes and then... Just rub your eyes...
