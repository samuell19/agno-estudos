-[projector whirring] -[light music] [light switch clicks] [light switch clicks] [cars passing] [woman] We got this letter in the mail today from a very angry customer. [somber music] "After leaving Cambodia for everything America has to offer, then why would you want to change our government to that system of government? Would you have had that success with your restaurant in Cambodia? You seem to blame President Trump for COVID. If we would have shut down completely any longer, your business and most others would have failed and our country would be in a depression. Of course, you could return to Cambodia for opportunity. You are right that many of your customers are Trump supporters, but Bad Axe isn't changing from traditional American values. My family and many will be changing our restaurant routine, and Rachel's is no longer a choice." And about ten exclamation marks. I feel like exactly what we were afraid of happening by... I guess, sharing our family's story and speaking up is happening. Everything we were afraid of is happening. [somber music] [Trump] My fellow Americans, it started in China and is now spreading throughout the world. This is a global pandemic. [woman] Every day, we keep reporting increasing numbers of cases and deaths here in Michigan. [man 1] Michigan is currently fifth in the nation, and in deaths we are currently seventh. [thunder rumbling] [woman] Asian Americans are reporting an increase in racist encounters. [woman 2] And the state's case count now jumps by the hundreds. There are now more than a thousand confirmed cases of coronavirus here in Michigan. [man 2] ...restaurants, coffee shops-- all ordered by Governor Whitmer to stop normal business to prevent the spread of coronavirus. [woman 3] The surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans only getting worse. [man 3] The number of coronavirus cases at home and abroad... [wind whistling] [car door closes] [Governor Whitmer] If you're not an essential business, you need to close and you need to protect your employees, and we're confident that the vast majority of people are gonna do the right thing. The carry-out/dine-out option is still something that is available to people. This is an essential service, which is the feeding of the people of our state. So the restaurant where you can get your takeout, those will all still continue to serve the public. [liquid dripping] [woman] We spray our car doors before we even open 'em. We spray 'em when we get back in. -[woman 2] Wear freaking gloves, please. -We are! We will wear masks, glasses, gloves. We know. We're not stupid, Jaclyn. You have high blood pressure! Three-fourths of the people that have died, three-fourths all have had high blood pressure. That is their preexisting condition. Can-- can we just stop for one moment? I'm going home. You just go do whatever you've gotta do. David, why are you filming me right now? [David] I've got a lot of free time. You can work at the restaurant. Dude, I definitely, like-- you can't really post these because you really don't want people to know that you were just on a cruise. I bet Mommy and Baba never thought they'd have all four kids living under the same roof again. And you guys just moved into a new apartment last week. [David] Mm-hmm. And I don't really want to be in New York right now, so... That's true. Bad Axe is probably a lot safer than New York right now. It's probably a good thing you guys got out when you did. But it's crazy to think that literally one week ago we were on a cruise ship. And now, like, things are, like... starting to get really bad. [axe thudding] [gentle music] [man] Why are you filming everything, David? [David] I just think it's a... it's an important time in history right now and I just wanna document everything. [man] And why are you filming me? [David] I don't know. [hissing] [Rachel] Am I gonna be in your way over here? [David] No, but it's-- it's the sound, Mom. Sound is the concern. -I won't make any sound. -Even the footsteps. -Oh, okay. -[David chuckles] [David] Tell me about these photos. Just make sure you show them to camera, to me too. Show it to the camera like this? Yeah, just talk about them and show them to me. [somber guitar music] [Chun] This is what a piece of land is right before any footing going around. Here's a picture of Rachel with our children, Jaclyn and Michelle. Our baby at the time, David. Here's the three kids standing in front of the front entrance. It didn't take a whole lot to keep the "childrens" happy. Just tell 'em this is gonna be our future donut shop. It "felts" like building the American dream, having come into this country as a refugee from Cambodia. Raquel was born right after the opening. As business keep growing, children keep growing, the minute they're old enough to work, there they are. Part of our family business. I'm proud of these kids. [voice breaks] Really proud of them. [phone ringing] [Jaclyn] They wanted ketchup with your kids' tenders, okay. They want ranch, and then we just need a kids' quesadilla, all right? Raquel, is there any salsa and sour cream in there? [Raquel] Quesadilla with french fries. [man] Raquel, is it busy right now? We're actually not super busy right now. But we're not used to doing this many takeout orders, so it's a bit of a learning curve. [sizzling] -[Raquel] Hot food coming out! -Okay. [broom clatters] [David] So where are we at right now? Well, this is pretty much my second home here. Uh, I've been working ever since I was a little girl and we were making donuts. I actually have a whole 'nother life and career in Ann Arbor. I have a corporate job that I work at, you know, on the weekdays, but I always come home on the weekends to help the family out. With COVID and everything going on now, my husband Mike and I are able to work from home, so we decided to move back temporarily to help my parents kind of run the business and hopefully they can stay home more where they're safe. Mike? Can you come get new mop water? He's pretty good about helping out when you ask him to. -[Mike] I came right back-- -You did come back and do dishes. -[Mike] So, yeah-- -I'm very proud of you, thank you. -You really need new mop water? -I really need new mop water. [chuckles] No, Mike's good. He helps out. I mean, he obviously didn't, like, grow up in a restaurant like we did, so... Ah, cricket! Oh, come here, little guy. We've all put a lot of blood, sweat, and tears into this kitchen over the past 20 years, but that's kind of how we got to where we are today. [light somber music] [TV playing faintly] [man on TV] ...investigated 25,000 restaurants and bars. Business leaders say a comprehensive restaurant rescue plan will be needed. -I mean, I don't know what else to say... -[Chun] Mm. ...other than you're kind of gonna have to have that talk of unemployment. It-- it's not-- you have no choice. They're just gonna have to. Who would've ever thought a freaking virus would put this whole world and country in a halt? Nobody. [woman on TV] ...if you completely sideline it for, let's say three months, is $1 trillion enough? That is the conversation... [sizzling] I'm just going back and looking at parties that we were supposed to have, you know, this month. I mean, I have a couple people that are great with keeping their deposits and rescheduling, and then I have a couple people that are, you know, "they're not on the same page as us" type of thing. They're like, "Well, this shouldn't be happening," and, you know, by law, we can't open, so there's nothing we can do. [coins rattling] [David] How much did we make today? [Jaclyn] Let's just say it was a really bad day. Probably the worst day we've had... in, like, five years. Probably more. [Rachel] Our whole lives just changed, shut down, no longer have customers come into the building. [Jaclyn] It's not because we're, like, making bad food or not trying or anything, it's... obviously out of everybody's control. It reminds me of when we literally-- like, we're just struggling to survive, trying to make money off of donuts. [somber music] Our lives were completely different growing up. Back when the restaurant was still a donut shop, there were multiple times that I remember we almost had our electricity shut off, both at the donut shop and at our house. There were seven of us living in a two-bedroom, like, 1,000-square-foot home... and we all shared one bathroom. David, actually, you slept on the floor the first ten years of your life because there was only two bedrooms. [David] Yeah, that was pretty rough. [Jaclyn] I guess when you grow up knowing what it's like to have nothing, you're always afraid of going back to that point. [David] I know. I think we'll be okay, though. [wind whistling] [Jaclyn] So, sushi night, or sushi day. First time that we're gonna be serving sushi starting at noon. Hopefully, today helps make up for a lot of lost business over the week. Also, we really have to figure out an organized system, though. I'm actually really stressed out about that. Becca, go sanitize yourself. Go dip your hands in bleach, wash yourself-- everything. I'm a little nervous, but I think it's just the nervousness of sushi night in general. I think Jaclyn's precautions are very necessary. [Jaclyn] Emily, I need you to take it really, really seriously. A lot of people who are coming in here are either trying sushi for their first time or their first time trying sushi was at our restaurant. [Rachel] It's a new system for us. We've never ever, ever done it this way and so we're just trying to get in the groove. Hello, Chilinger-- Chilinger. -[man] Yes. -All righty, it's gonna be $14.84, please. [Jaclyn] All of our sushi-- it's like sushi but with our own twist on it. And once people try it, they're like, "Huh, it's not what I thought it was." And then it's like a thing. It's like its own event now that a lot of people in our community look forward to. -[phone ringing] -[Rachel] Okay, where's that freaking phone? Hello, Rachel's of Bad Axe, how may I help you? -$44.52, please. -[phone ringing] It's not in sync yet. -Maybe rice-- -Why don't you take orders? -I was taking orders, Jaclyn! -Shut up. [Jaclyn] Come on. It's not time-- -You're wasting more time bitching. -[Jaclyn] No, you are, Mom! -I top-- I top them with avocado. -Look at it. It says "avocado." -[phone ringing] -[Rachel mockingly weeping] -Don't drop it. -Whose is this? What is this? -[phone ringing] -[Rachel sighs] -[woman] The sushi kitchen has a ball in here. -[workers cheering] You guys rock, man. Good job. Could not have done it without not a single one of you. This was something that people appreciated and so forth. -Sorry for being mean to you. -I'm sorry for being mean to you too. -[woman] Pip, where does this go? -Oh, my gosh. [wind whistling] [gentle guitar music] [Mike] With the restaurant being slow, we're trying this new delivery thing. When I'm done working, I-- I'll make runs for the restaurant. I know this town so well, you know, growing up here. Bad Axe is a place where, like, if you grew up here, you really couldn't wait to get out. All we did as kids was, like, play basketball or football or hockey. But there's really not much else to do. It's got a theater that shows two movies. It's got two stoplights and it's got a Walmart, so it's not-- it doesn't have a whole lot of things to offer. We've talked about moving back here just 'cause it's a-- it's a nice place to raise a family. You know, it's safe, it's, uh... Everybody knows everybody, so it's a-- it's a sense of community in that way. All right, have a good day. Thanks. [car ajar beeping] $10 tip, I will take it. Yeah, the CDC recommends everybody wear masks when they're out-- out in public around people and apparently it's getting a lot of backlash in this community. People don't like to be told what to do. So, uh, they will fight that as much as they can. [Chun] Making a homemade face mask. It's not a bad-looking mask. [Jaclyn] So, the best thing for Mom and Baba to do, instead of him sitting here, hanging around all of us, is to go home. You know how Dad is. If I just said it, he'd be like... [scoffs] "What do you know?" I have to, like, get mad about it and, like, fight. Do you understand what the mask does? [Chun] These are so your spit doesn't get all over the fucking place, okay? If an N95's not even effective unless you wear it perfect, then these masks are not gonna be effective... -Okay, here. [exhales forcefully] -...unless you wear it perfect. -You're so cool. -And that's the fucking thing, okay? [Chun] God damn it. Do you need to be here right now? I know, I know. I'm going home. -And bring Baba with you. -I know, I'm going home. [Raquel] It's more effective than any mask. -[Jaclyn] You're panicked! -[Chun] I'm panicked! I'm scared! -[Jaclyn] So you-- I know! -Okay, and you know what? I'm scared because I don't want three of my kids to take care of me when I'm sick! Then stay quarantined and stop going places! You were literally at the restaurant from 10:00 until 7:00 tonight. -[Chun] I'm sewing masks. -Baba, what don't you understand? That if you get sick, it doesn't matter anyways. -If-- if who gets sick? -You! If I-- if anybody gonna get sick, okay-- [voice breaks] It's gonna be you. That's fine... but then-- then we stop being positive and we stop caring about making anything work. Why don't you understand that? If something happens to you, it does-- nothing matters anymore! I don't care if we're poor. I don't care if we even lose the restaurant, and I love the restaurant. I don't care about any of that stuff! You know that! Come here. It's okay. I know. Obviously, Baba and I are both really scared and worried. We just have a different way of dealing with-- -like, dealing with our fear. -[cat meowing] It's okay. It's okay. He just always goes into this survival mode. Like, his every thought becomes, "What am I gonna do to survive?" And that's all he can think about. Like, the safest thing he can do is stay at home. That's what's gonna minimize the risk the most. -[cat meowing] -[grunts] Ow-w-w. Goo, go away. [chuckles] I know, I know. It's okay. [Chun] When they say a fruit don't fall far off from its tree, it's almost true when I look at Jaclyn-- how passionate she is toward life and how dedicated she is to her family. She's taking care of this cat that was born handicapped, paralyzed from the waist down. I think Jaclyn remind me a lot of her grandmother, which is my mom. When Rachel and I would struggle with the donut shop, thank God we had my mom at home help raising the kids. [indistinct chatter] [Chun] Shortly after she passed away, Jaclyn was just a young teenager. She just stepped right in. [Jaclyn] My Ma, which is what we call my grandma, is the one who taught me what it means to sacrifice for your family. I just always grew up thinking if she could survive a genocide and come to this country, the least I could do is help my family run a business. [Chun] We couldn't survive just selling coffee and donuts, so we had to turn the whole business into a family restaurant. We don't know what we are doing. After Jaclyn graduated from college, she have a full-time job and she took that income to help support and invest in the family business to make us successful as we are today. Taking care of her job, taking care of her family's business, taking care of her family. Now, that is Jaclyn. -[both chuckling] -[Jaclyn muffled] Sorry. [Jaclyn] Seriously. -[Mike mumbles] -Fine, I'll dance with you, but usually you dance like... [chuckles] other ways. [TV playing in background] [Jaclyn sighs] This concrete was poured in April of 2000. Raquel would have not even been two years old yet. Now she can run the whole restaurant. [guitar music] [professor] A few announcements. Final papers are gonna be due next Tuesday. -Thanks for coming. Hi, Raquel. -Hi, sorry. No, that's all right. We're just getting going. All right, so... [Raquel] This year, I'm graduating from University of Michigan. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic, I have to finish my classes online. But that's okay. In between classes, I get to hang out with my family. And my boyfriend Austin also works at the restaurant, so it's nice to be surrounded by the people I love. -Uh, we've got the Alfredo pandemic of 2020. -[both chuckle] [Raquel] Whenever somebody asks me what my plans are after graduation, I always get nervous because I'm not exactly sure. But all I know is, like, right now I need to help at the restaurant and be here for my family. [David] So do you think you're gonna take over the restaurant one day? Um... I don't know, I... It's not-- I'm not exactly sure what my future plans are. It's not always easy. Not everybody knows what their passion is right away, -like you, David. -[David] Yeah. -This good? -[woman] Yeah, okay. I'm pretty sure you just lazily put that mic on your shirt. I did, but that's because I don't think we're gonna use this footage at all. We should use this footage. You're part of the family. [guitars playing] [Chun singing "Champa Battambang"] [Kat] Are you happy that you came to Michigan? I am. I'm very happy I came to Michigan, um... Yeah, I-- I can't imagine being in New York right now. [singing continues] I love coming home. Being able to spend time with family... -Hey, what's up? Welcome to, uh... -[Jaclyn] David... And she got two. ...for all that it is-- the good, the bad, the ugly... All right, ready, guys? -[all laughing] -How much did you drink? [Kat] What made you wanna make this documentary? [David] I don't really know yet. Right now it's really observing the story of our family, of how this pandemic is affecting us. [singing continues] [David] But I've always felt my family had an important story to share, especially my dad. [singing continues] [David] His stories about surviving Cambodia has shaped so much of who I am as a filmmaker. We even made my first short film together about his childhood in Cambodia. And the more I learn about my family's history and how far we've all come in this country, the more I just want to share those stories. [Chun singing continues] [Chun] You know, I am scared to death about this pandemic. I never get that scared during the Cambodian Killing Field as what I am today. -[somber music] -[explosions] -[Chun] April 17, 1975... -[people screaming] ...when everything changed in Cambodia. Now we're dealing with a brand-new government -that are full of hate and anger. -[indistinct shouting] They forced everybody from the city into the countryside. Get out, get out. If you can't move, decide not to get out, they would just kill you right there on the spot. That is when the Killing Field begin. [music continues] This is the last place that I saw my father. My mom survived with six children, make our way to arrive in Romeo, Michigan. The nature of all-- everything what we did is through survival. It's no different when I'm talking to just two of you. I'm talking to all eight of you all at one time. I'm gonna close the restaurant down. Okay? Once I get done, I'm trying to get a little bit of money from the bank first. How long can we afford to stay closed? [scoffs] Ha! Right now we've got nothing to lose. But I can't make another one of you or you or you or her or me. Yes, a lot of people have died from it, -but a lot of people have also been okay. -Yes. Yes. That's what we say the chances are. I still have really high hope that none of us is infected. Don't push it. [soft music] Think really hard. Does Baba actually mean that? -We all want to be healthy. -But you have to be logical. Okay, I know. I'm not saying that we close the restaurant-- -What does... -[overlapping dialogue] [Jaclyn] Even as a kid, I worried about money. Being the oldest child, I always felt that I had to do everything I could to make sure I helped the restaurant so that we would have a house to live in. It was never an option to give up. They're gonna start closing gas stations too, like the convenience part. -Just if you want gas, you just pay out at the pump. -Oh. Credit card only. [Rachel] I wanna know why you wanna stay open. [Jaclyn] Because I think that you and Baba are panicking, and I'm not saying that people shouldn't be concerned. That is not what I'm saying. Baba can't even be happy when things are good, and you think he's gonna be happy when things are bad? Jaclyn, what about if just you guys open? -You told me you-- -I just want you guys to stay away from us. -[Rachel] Okay. -And don't bug us when we're here. [Rachel] I won't, I promise. Pssh. -[Jaclyn] What is, uh... -Chicken burrito one time, b-mac quesadilla. Give me a buffalo mac, please. -We just need those shrimp tacos. -Yeah. [Jaclyn] This is the first time in 30 years that my parents can actually take a little break and not have to worry about waking up and going to run a business. [Rachel] We don't have to see anybody, we don't have to talk to anyone. Just enjoy the drive, the view. [Jaclyn] Even with all of the craziness going on in the world right now, I think it's important to appreciate the little things in life that maybe we took for granted before. [Chun] Easter Sunday, April the 12th, 2020. We make the best out of it. -I didn't go there-- -He has every right to build the road there. -[Jaclyn] But I didn't go there. -I'm gonna burn this game. [Rachel] Well, this is the first recipe made out of a cookbook at home. [all] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ -[laughter] -[clippers buzzing] -Why are you going back there already? -[all laughing] [vacuum whirring] Bam, bam... [both laughing] You weirdo. -What? -[Jaclyn] Mike? -[chuckles] What? -[Kat] You look like a porn star, bro. [Jaclyn] Why, Mike, why? [laughs] [Mike] Tensions are high right now. I gotta bring a little comedy to the house. -[laughter] -You look like-- my gosh. -Mike, what is going on? -[Austin cackling] -Why? -Why not? Austin, do you like it? It looks like you should have about four or five kids running around here. I should. I'm 34 years old. -Should have at least three. -[Rachel] At least. -[Jaclyn] Oh, my God. -[chuckles] Why are you still on my face? [David laughing] Can't get over it, man. [birds chirping] [emergency alert blaring] [Rachel] "Emergency alert from the governor's office. The state of Michigan has extended the 'Stay Home, Stay Safe' order until May 15th." [Chun] You know, this whole entire pandemic thing is just so scary. People dying every day. You're talking about hundreds if it's not thousands of people dying. And I get so angry to the people that don't take this serious enough. Everywhere I go, I still wear a mask. I mean, I-- I just not quite "understands" how this whole entire "wear a mask" thing become a political issue. You know, just the other day, get out of the Walmart, I-- all masked up, I have my safety glass on, because I take the safety precaution really serious. And I get a group of kid sitting in a pickup truck, roll the window down, and you would not believe what they tell me. "What the fuck are you doing? Go back to where you come from." -[turn signal clicking] -For that moment, its make me think that someone like me, been live in this county for over 20 years, and I still have a really small handful of the ignorant individual... that I will never change. [gentle music] [Jaclyn] The fact of the matter is a majority of Huron County are Trump supporters. Speaking up against Trump could be detrimental to our restaurant. If this community turns against us, then our whole lives can be wiped away like that. We would never treat anyone any different because of their politics. We have people walk in here wearing MAGA hats all the time and we treat them the same. Because, at the end of the day, we're all still a part of the same community. Even some of our best customers are Trump supporters. Some of our employees are too. [whispers] But I think we've changed them a little bit. And that's what matters is that people can change. You just can't force it on them. [light music] Hi, how are you doing? I've been working here for about six years now and before meeting the Siev family, I really wasn't exposed to that much diversity. Since I met Raquel in fourth grade, I look at the Siev family as kind of being part of my own. I feel like if I hadn't met Raquel, I probably wouldn't be the same person I am today. Raquel's last day of school, last exams over with. Now it's time to celebrate. It's by far her favorite shot. [ice clinking] I'm done! -[Raquel coughing] I'm done with school forever! -[Austin laughs] Unless graduate school, but I don't know yet. [birds chirping] [Rachel] Well, I'm just curious of, like, where can we, like, put the direction -of what you wanna do? -[Raquel coughs] I just wanna know if you're going to go 100% with the restaurant or go 100% finding another job somewhere else. That's all I wanna know. Okay, you said you didn't want an answer from me right this second, and I don't have an answer for you right this second... -Okay, I just want you to think about it. -...so ask me tomorrow. But everyone can't just hang on a limb, wondering, like, "Is she gonna help out for a couple more years or is she not?" [Rachel] Make a decision on what you wanna do as an adult, period. I mean, it's a really good thing and we're not-- it's not a bad thing, what we're talking about. [light music] [Rachel] I didn't have the opportunities growing up like my kids have today. I'm Mexican American. My dad was a factory worker in Detroit and my mom didn't even get a chance to finish high school. I started working at restaurants and that's how I met Chun. [Chun] She just fall right out of the sky one day and I say, "Oh, who the heck is that? Oh, that girl named Rachel." [Rachel] Chun was a tae kwon do instructor at the time, and I started taking his classes and that's how we fell in love. [Chun] Rachel and I didn't go to schools like all our kids did, so we do what we have to do to survive. We were just two passionate people that tried to run a donut shop and a tae kwon do school. [no audible dialogue] I've been teaching martial art for the past 37 years. My teaching year was some of my best year. And I always made sure to teach my kids about self-defense as much as possible. [music continues] [no audible dialogue] -Here in Huron County, everybody have gun. -[gunshot] I think education and teaching and, you know, make sure everybody understand how to use a gun and use it properly. [gun clip clicking] So when you feed it... you've gotta do this. -Gotta let it go smooth, okay? -[Mike] Okay. And then all you do just now, empty it and then... -[gunfire] -[David] Aw! -[Mike laughs] -[David] Aw! [Chun] See what I'm saying, though? [David] Aw, shit, I can't hear. [Chun] No, it's just, uh... me too. -I don't have one ear. -[David] Oh, God. So I say, "You know what? Get down on your knee. Get down on your fucking knee right now." Okay, you do exactly, right? -Mm-hmm, as they say. -Do exactly. Now you can pull the trigger. There's nothing in there because I already showed you a dozen times. -Keep pulling that. -[trigger clicking] Okay, good. So now... the hammer's not there. -The gun you hold like this, okay? -Mm-hmm. -I am... like this. -[chuckles] Now look at where the-- where the peoples at, 'kay? I-- make sure-- what I would-- you deflect it. Wherever you deflect it, you know, that's where most likely that's-- that's where it's gonna go off. -Mm-hmm. -Okay? What in the hell are you guys doing? -Can you stop? -[Austin chuckles] I agree. -What? -[Rachel] Chun! Stop. [sprinkler clicking] [dog barking in distance] There's no more recycle in the whole county. So you either bury it or burn it. [guitar music] When I first came to this community from Cambodia, I know how to farm with a fucking-- a team of water buffalo and I come here, I have to listen to these farmer complains about there's no air conditioning in the tractor yet. I always have some fun conversations with farmers and they say, "Oh, I'm just one little city kid, don't know a whole lot of anythings about farming." I was laughing. And when I tell them what I used to farm with, they say, "You didn't do that." I say, "The fuck I am." ["Champa Battambang" playing] -[fire crackling] -[crickets chirping] [Mike] You have-- a lot of people can congregate in this area. Okay, here. Here's-- take the chair and chair. These are the same family, okay? -[Mike] Table right here? -You could. -[Chun] No, you-- -Depends on where this table's at. No, you don't want to-- you don't want to put a table here. Okay. Just move all the rocks over, put a-- put a, like, a rug or something. You can't. The ground is not level. Well, I want you to tell me why, not just "you can't." You know what, I'm fucking going home. You guys deal with it. If you just shut up and just listen to the actual thing that you should do instead of wasting your breath on stupid things like that. That's what the actual thing-- that's what I'm gonna do. I understand-- okay, go. -Go, go, go. Yep. You got it. -Right? You know what you're doing. [light piano music] [Chun] When I first went to the doctor's 30-some years ago, he said, "Chun, you've got some type-A personality." [Chun grunting] I said, "What was that again, Doc?" He said, "Type-A personality." I said, "What's that 'A' stand for?" He said, "You really want to know?" I said, "Yeah, Doc." He said, "Asshole." Do I have post-traumatic stress, something from where I came from? Think of what a human being as from 15 years old to 18 years old live during the Killing Field, get beat, starving... watching so many people -get killed... -[inaudible screaming] ...and cannot say one word, being tortured... ...what it would do to a human being. I don't know. [music continues] [Jaclyn] Oh, I mentioned that I pay for stuff, and Baba makes it seem like I complain about money 'cause Baba wants to go spend all the money. And, oh, I have no right to any money, ever. Oh, I spend my money on my cat. My money, my money. [Raquel] Baba, let her spend her money on her cats. [Jaclyn] I don't spend it on stuff trying to show off. -I'm gonna-- -[Jaclyn] I actually have freaking stuff to do. -I'm gonna be as fucking as mean as I can be. -[Jaclyn] Good, good. I have stuff to do, Baba, because I don't have time... You know what? Take your fucking thing and head out the door. -Why don't you? -[Chun] This is not your fucking place. -You should pack your shit and start to get out. -[Jaclyn] Yup, yup, okay. I close this fucking place down and burn it right down. Good. Exactly, just out of spite, because you're a child. -That's right. -Good for you. -[Chun] This place will run with or without you. -Good for you. Yeah, good for you. Keep going. -I'm gonna sit right here until the fucking cows come home. -Okay, well, then I'm gonna... I don't even know what that means, but okay, I'm gonna listen to music and get work done because I have stuff to do. -Go for it. -Okay. [piano music] [Chun] Every day is a battle. I can be wake up in the greatest mood and all it take is freaking glass of milk tip over, my whole fucking day is ruined. [Jaclyn whispers] He's such a jerk. [piano music] [Jaclyn] I bend over backwards every day, 'cause if I don't, who's going to? I don't want them to have to. They're just oblivious. If she thinks I treat her the way I was treated by these people, she doesn't know what it's like to be treated bad. Why do I, after all these fucking things I go through, come here and put up with a brat like that? [Rachel] The truth hurts. And the words that you used and use on your daughter are wrong. 100% wrong. To say that... I didn't have a problem, I'd be lying. I do. I do. Every day. [birds chirping] [gentle music] [Chun] If anybody asks me, "Do I have a moment that I'm not proud of myself as a dad?" I have more than a moment. Am I giving her enough credit? Probably not. But deep down in my heart, I know what she have done. There's a difference between you know it in your heart and you show it through your action. I didn't show enough through my action, probably. [birds chirping] [emotional music] [man] We begin tonight with America at the threshold of a heartbreaking milestone. Nearly 100,000 lives lost to the coronavirus pandemic -in this country alone. -I'm in trouble. There's an African-American man threatening my life. [woman on TV] There are new developments in the death of George Floyd, the unarmed Black man in Minneapolis who died in police custody. [man] That is an American television reporter Omar Jimenez being led away by police... -[man] Don't shoot! -[explosion] -[crowd shouting] -[man coughs] -[explosion] -[crowd shouting] [Kamala Harris on TV] This is not just a moment, it is a movement fueled by the beautiful diversity of who we are coming together as a unified body. The voices of peaceful protest are being hijacked by violent radical elements. [Obama on TV] There is a change in mindset that's taking place, -a greater recognition that we can do better. -[crowd cheering] The looters should not be allowed to drown out the voices of so many peaceful protesters they hurt so badly. [man on TV] "When the looting starts, the shooting starts," the President of the United States. [Biden] This is no time for incendiary tweets. It's no time to encourage violence. This is a national crisis. We need real leadership right now. It's time for us to face that deep, open wound we have in this nation. We need justice for George Floyd. It is Blackout Tuesday. Maybe you noticed on social media black squares shared on Instagram over and over to express solidarity with those protesting the murder of George Floyd. [Jaclyn] We have had to bite our tongue, like, how many times in Huron County? -[Raquel] The last four years. -Screw it, we're gonna do it. Post a black picture onto Rachel's of Bad Axe! First time Rachel's profile picture has ever changed since, what, 2015, 2014? -Where's my headphones? -[Skyler] You should keep the profile picture like that. [Jaclyn] On the Rachel's page? I mean, yeah, forever. It looks really cool. Wait, did I see that someone in Bad Axe organized -a Black Lives Matter? -Stephanie Butch. ...like the thing of protest march -starting at the courthouse. -[Jaclyn] How cool is that? Someone that works here is the person that starts it in-- Like, but, like, that's who needs to start, like, a white, homegrown-- like, a white woman that was born to, like, a white probably conservative family. Like, coming from us, it's like, "Oh, the Siev-- well, it's 'cause they're, like--" Oh, shit, I have a team meeting. I have a meeting right now. Sorry, I'm gonna-- I will finish it. I have a meeting right at 1:00. Thank God that thing popped up. [crickets chirping] [man on TV] What happens now? [woman on TV] We have to help all people, regardless of race, unified in understanding the significance of this. [woman on TV] That is the Los Angeles Police Department. There was a much more sizable police presence that just suddenly advanced off of that one block. And what's been happening is that at... [music continues] [Austin] Honestly, I recognize that I'm different in only one way and that's my skin color. But other than that, man, I'm pretty much the same as everybody around here. [David] And you're adopted, right? [Austin] Right, yeah, I am adopted. You know, my parents, they're white, so that probably helps a lot. [Raquel] I think it's hard for Austin to talk about his Blackness because he grew up in this white community, but when I talk to Austin about my experiences of growing up in this community as a minority, I think he realized that racism comes in many different forms. [Austin] I hate that Huron County is judged as, like, racist. People are usually nice to me when I'm around, but maybe when I'm not around, they can be a completely different person. [Raquel] So I'm just trying to let him know that it's okay for him to have those conversations about him being Black and how that makes him feel. [Austin] It's just not fun to talk about at all. Anything related to being a Black person, any questions related to being Black, man, just I hate talking about it. [crickets chirping] [Jaclyn] Part of me is, like, scared of like-- not scared of going-- but, like-- I'm scared to see our customers. Like, I'm gonna be in front of-- Like, I'm scared to see our customers, and I'm scared that it, like, for it to be held, like, against our family. Like, I-- I want to go. Just show up and show your support. I think they're gonna have a couple of speakers... [Jaclyn] I feel like one of the reasons why my parents are able to make the restaurant successful is because they assimilated in the way that people expect them to. Come to work, get your stuff done, don't open your mouth, don't say too much, make sure you don't speak up too loud. My parents are good at biting their tongue, but I don't think I can be that way. [sizzling] [Chun] As a businessman in a small town, the art of winning the war is not always, you know, get out there and expose yourself. I'm not gonna expose myself. I'm not gonna go on top of a stage. I am a Asian American. You are the Mexican American. Trying to do business in this community, try to learns about this community, fight all the adversity from the beginning, why now, all of a sudden, you just want to stick your head out to be the-- might be the target? [birds chirping] Austin? Hello? Are you coming? Yeah. I'm sure I'll be in the area. -[chuckles] What does that mean? -Who knows? -What do you mean you're gonna "be in the area"? -I'll be in the area. -Why don't you go with your parents? Maybe then-- -You might see 'em. [somber music] Where is it? [exhales] There are just cops stationed everywhere, so... [David] It's crazy. Are you, like, nervous at all? 'Cause I am. -Yeah, I mean... -It's like... We're also gonna be-- not only am I Black coming up there, you've got a big camera. -We're gonna have eyes on us. -[turn signal clicking] Right here should be good. -[Rachel] Hello. -Hi. -Hi, Rachel. Good, how are you? -Hello, how are you doing? I'm okay. [Raquel] It's so weird having this happen in this environment. Like, I'm more comfortable, I guess, in Ann Arbor at a Black Lives Matter protest versus being in Bad Axe at a Black Live Matters protest. [Skyler] In the 2016 election, I voted for Donald Trump. I had been surrounding myself with very conservative Republican people-- families, friends-- and it took me a really long time to realize what type of a person he truly is. I really dug deep into my soul and thought, "I can be my own person." This will be the first step that I've taken publicly and I'll be able to look back on it one day and tell my children, you know, it takes every ounce of your soul -to stand up for what's right... -[indistinct chanting] even if your family doesn't agree with you. [protesters chanting] Black lives matter! Black lives matter! [Chun] Am I stick my head out there to put myself as a target? No, I don't. I'm not silence about this whole thing. Let these kids express themself. [protesters chanting] I can't breathe! -[woman] No justice! -[crowd] No peace! [Austin] Before the George Floyd thing, did I really pay much attention to police brutality? No. I don't pay attention to really anything. [protesters chanting] Black lives matter! Black lives matter! -[protesters] George Floyd! -[woman] Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -[man] White power! -[protesters] George Floyd! -[woman] Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! -George Floyd! -Say his name! [woman 2] We're unarmed! We're unarmed! Why do you feel the need to be armed? We have a right. We have freedom of speech. -And we are protecting your right. -Right, good. They're fucking cowards, that's why, that's why, that's why! That's why you have your fucking guns! 'Cause they're fucking cowards! -[woman 3] You ain't shit with that gun! -[protesters shouting] -[man] That's why! -[woman 3] Are you scared?! -You're a tough guy! -Ignore them. I'm out. -You don't need that fucking gun! -Hold that in their face. Some people are dead! They're dead because I've been silent because I didn't have these conversations. Another death happens. [Jaclyn] Wait, who are they worried about inciting violence, though? The protesters or the fucking little bitches here? You tell me, look around you. I could've been gunned down, died the next day. And it wouldn't have mattered to him, but it made me feel like my life didn't matter. [cheering and applause] [man] Sieg Heil! [protesters chanting] Knowledge is power! Knowledge is power! -[woman] Black lives matter! -[protesters] Black lives matter! -Black lives matter! -Black lives matter! -Black lives matter! -Black lives matter! -Would you be willing to say Black lives matter? -All lives matter. It's Black people right now in America that are crying out for our help. All lives matter. [protesters shouting] [man] You, sir, serve your country! -It's fucking disrespectful that you're here. -[masked man] Quiet, gook. [man] What? No, you're talking to me right now, fucker, come on! -No, he called me a gook. -You don't wanna speak out against me. [Jaclyn] I think you mean a gook, you fucking dumbass. You can't even fucking pronounce it right. -[Jaclyn] God! -[protesters shouting] [woman] Black lives matter! [Mike] Cowards! You think you're tough. [Raquel] Take that mask off! Take those sunglasses off! -[masked man] We are supported by the establishment. -[man shouting] [Jaclyn] Fuck you and fuck you, fuck you and fuck you! [protesters shouting] I can't breathe! [protesters chanting] I can't breathe! -I can't breathe! -[siren blaring] [man] I can't breathe! -I can't breathe! -[blaring continues] [protesters] Black lives matter! [man] Everyone off the roads. There's gonna be traffic coming through. [protesters] Black lives matter! [Jaclyn] Standing up for other people is not something that should be political. It's just doing the right thing. Like, how can you stand silent and not do the right thing? This right here, this guy first. Oh, oh, one, two, three. Master, master, master. We are trying to figure out who-- one of the Nazi wannabe, Hitler-loving piece of shits from yesterday it was. Sorry, we were trying to figure out who that little kid in the middle was. Well, that was-- that kid is-- know... they know us. I promise their names are gonna come out. Well, you know, send his ass to the FBI and have them keep an eye on him. [protesters chanting] Black lives matter! Black lives matter! Black lives matter! -Black lives matter! -[indistinct chatter] What did he say to me? Right there, do you see when he yelled out? And he went to say "fuck something," probably, I don't know. -[ominous music] -[chatter continues] [Jaclyn shudders] Brr, it, like-- it's freezing out. Here, this is what it looks like right at this moment. This is what it's seeing. [Chun] They're looking at you right now. I'm just, uh, always look out ahead of time because, you know, time's tough. You never know what's gonna happen. [Jaclyn] This woman's saying that she can no longer support us because she heard this location supports the Black Lives Matter movement. So-- If so, she will not be able to support us anymore. We need to do our research. It's been a really tough couple of months for us, I mean, for all restaurants, but it's nice for things to start getting back to normal. [Governor Whitmer] Under this executive order, businesses that resume in-person work must, among other things, develop a COVID-19 preparedness and response plan. Going to work is going to feel different for a little while. [Rachel's voice breaks] We're getting ready to open. [laughing, sobbing] Maybe it was just all bottled up, I don't know, but I feel very... [sniffles] alive. -[chuckles] I know, it's weird. [sniffling] -[David] Aw, Mom. -[David] This is your place. The doors are opening again. -I know. I know. Well, just look at the sun shining through. I mean, when's the last time you saw that? In the morning. I mean, you see it in the afternoon 'cause the sun's blaring in, but... [sniffles] It's just-- it struck my core. Aw, I missed you, and I'm telling you, you didn't disappoint 'cause I knew you were gonna be the first ones. Um, I'm sure Stephanie or Skyler will be right with you. -Thanks for everything, Rachel! -Okay, yup. -[indistinct chatter] -[woman] It's good to be home. [Rachel] Aw, yes, thank you! [silverware clinking] [crickets chirping] Ma planted these flowers when we first moved here, so that'd be, like, 22 years ago? Because Ma loved flowers. Baba always tells me that he wishes she was still alive today 'cause she would be able to buy whatever flowers she wanted. When the petals start to fall, like, the whole yard will be full of like petals. You pull in the driveway and the first thing you think of is Ma. Or Ma's peonies. I wish she was still here so she can see how much our family has grown and how much the restaurant has changed. [gentle music] [Governor Whitmer] Effective immediately, groups of 100 or less can gather outdoors so long as they maintain social distancing. [all] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ -[cheering] -[indistinct chatter] -[man] Whoo! -[indistinct chatter] "Graduating class of 2020. University of Michigan." There I am, Raquel Lucille Siev. -[cheering] -[Jaclyn] Here, it's a little mini graduation/celebration for you. I'm just so proud of you guys. I'm so happy to have you guys as a part of our team. Don't forget, guys, I'm a dad, okay? And I'm looking at all of you guys just like my kid, and I'm really grateful. [Jaclyn] "To the staff at Rachel's, thank you for your generous and delicious gift of meals for our staff at McLaren Thumb. Sincerely, McLaren Thumb and ER staff." -[man] Come on, Mike! -[Austin] Damn straight! Yes! Birdie. [Chun] First member of my family showed up... It take a pandemic for me to develop my sense of empathy toward the people that have less fortunate than I do. Hi. -Give me the elbow, man. -[laughter] It's just the two of us for a really long time. [laughter] [Governor Whitmer] So while Michiganders are no longer required to stay home, we must all continue to practice social distancing. If you choose to go to a restaurant, be smart. -We all have a responsibility here. -[grunts] -[indistinct chatter] -And I think that that is really good news. [uplifting music] [ominous music] -I am deaf. I have to read your lips. -I understand. Put your shirt over your face. -Okay, sir, you're walking out or... -I cannot hear you -unless you take your mask off. -Why are you not covering your mouth, A, or leaving, B? -You have two options. -I'm going to the bathroom. Okay, but we're asking you to cover your face. [Austin] Here, I'll just get you a mask. Is that cool? -[Rachel] Yeah. -I really don't know what you said. [Austin] I'll just grab you a mask and you can use the bathroom. -Then you gotta exit, please. -Please respect us. -I am respecting you. I am. -No, you're not. You're not. Put your shirt over your face or go out. -[Jaclyn] Somebody call the police, please. -Call the police, please. -He's acting like he's deaf. Like, he's not deaf. -Ready to go? -Go where? -Go leave the restaurant? -[Rachel] He's not welcome here anymore. -He's not? -Here, or leave. No, he's not. -It's time to go. It's the simple thing. You just cover your mouth. We appreciate it. That's it. [overlapping chatter] They told you to leave, now you have to leave. -So tally us out so we can go. -Yeah. -Tally us out. -We will. You go outside and we'll bring it right out. It's not a law that you have to wear a mask. [Rachel] I don't care if it's not a law. It's our policy, period. This is a bunch of bullshit. Bullshit. Can you see it? Bullshit. -[man] We'll take five stars on Google, though, please. -[Rachel] You know what? Screw you! Tell him to shut the fuck up. -He started it. -Okay. [overlapping chatter] -[woman] I'm not touching him. -[man] I'm not touching him. -I'm not touching him. -[chatter continues] -Get in there! Get in. -[Jaclyn] And don't talk to my mom like that. [yelling] Screw you, smiley fucking face. [Jaclyn] David, stop. [Raquel] Bye! What's your name? -You know what... -[man] It doesn't matter, right? [Raquel] They won't tell you their names. -[chatter continues] -[Rachel] That's enough. -Okay. -[Jaclyn] David, you fucking idiot. [David] What? We're going to have more stress with, you know, bringing the people on the premises and waiting on 'em and taking care of 'em. You got a problem, just get it done and out of the way and move on. Does anyone have any questions? No? Okay, well, I hope the morale picks up because right now, I just feel like I'm just down here low. I feel low. I don't wanna feel low. [emotional music] What if I don't want you to go to the restaurant? You okay with that? When do you see me happy? Like, I feel like-- -With your pets. -That's true. And if you had kids, I think you'd be just as happy. I'm... don't doubt that kids would make me happy. If I-- We're thinking about what's in the best interest of like our family, like, and like Raquel, like... I truly think that she should do the restaurant for at least a little bit. Well, what if there's a possibility for you to be in Bad Axe and do your job and then... you don't have, like, the full ownership of the place. -Or you just help out. -I mean, I think a big part is, though, like, what is Raquel going to decide to do? 'Cause I know, and I don't want to, like... I know restaurant business is so hard. I can't do it by myself. I can't. I don't wanna be like my parents, and I don't mean that in a bad way. [music continues] [Raquel] Jaclyn's been asking me a lot about what my plans are, and my mom's been asking me. But it's hard for me to make a decision 'cause who am I to not help the family when they need it? They take a lot of pride in the restaurant and that our family was able to get to where it is today. [Rachel] Seriously, David? What are you doing? Why do you do that? -[David] Aren't you gonna miss the camera in your face? -Oh. [laughs] Mmm, I don't think so, honey. What are we gonna do now? What are you gonna do now? -Put it all together. -Now you gotta go work for somebody else for a little while. [Mike] Yeah, David, what are you gonna do now? [David] Finish this movie. [dramatic music] [crickets chirping] -[somber guitar music] -[computer mouse clicks] [keyboard clacking] [message dings] [dings] [dings] [dings] [dings] [computer mouse clicks] [Brianna Keilar] Racist rhetoric against Asians and Asian Americans has become a real problem in the US amid the coronavirus that originated in China. The president is promoting this kind of language. He refers to and has referred to the virus as the "China Virus," as the "Kung Flu." "What a nice video about your family and living the American dream after leaving Cambodia for everything America has to offer. You were right that many of your customers are Trump supporters. But Bad Axe isn't changing from traditional American values. My family and many that we've discussed your video with will be changing our restaurant routine, and Rachel's is no longer a choice. Of course, you could return to Cambodia for opportunity." [Mike] That's what a small community should do. You should be able to disagree and still support each other. And not just be like, "Oh, if you don't believe the way I believe, I'm not coming to your restaurant and neither are any of my friends." I guess they just don't understand. They don't know because they don't ever go through that. They don't-- They're not in Walmart parking lot getting called an Asian slur at them like you have and your family has. When you come out and say things like you have, they can't understand it because they don't think it exists. "We'll support you if you stay quiet and just act the way we want you to act. And if you don't, then screw you." [wind blowing] David, this whole-- this whole filming thing that you do, I am really proud of you, okay? -But at the same time-- -Okay, but it also feels like you're so proud of me, but, like, don't say how you feel. -[Rachel] Uh, that's why we-- -Actually, at the end of the day, it's my love letter to Bad Axe. [Mike] If you think this is a love letter to Bad Axe... -[David] Mm-hmm. -...that-- You need to rewrite the love letter. And that can be up to you, how you can end that film. It's gonna be up to you if you think that it gonna be a love letter you want to wrote to Bad Axe. [emotional music] Baba's just afraid that your "love letter" to Bad Axe is... not gonna be taken as a love letter by some people in Bad Axe. -[David] Yeah. -Our Bad Axe and our experience in Bad Axe is different than probably most of the people that grew up here. Like, Bad Axe is still our home, and we still love it. [David] Right. Like, for me, what I love about Bad Axe is just being home and being here. It's not necessarily all of the small-town things that every small town has. It's home because family's here. Yeah. [music continues] [woman on phone] The thing is, right, you're making a movie, and you have them in this movie, you know, making it out to be, "Oh, we're being attacked by white supremacists." [Rachel] Did you not show up and did the Nazi salute? Are you that one? [woman] Yes. We were there first, correct? And, you know, the little Asian bitch came up when they weren't even there for you. -[Rachel] Who were you there for with hate? -[woman] Black Lives Matter. They weren't even there for Asians, but you guys decided to go up and start some shit just to get... [Rachel] No, I'm-- I don't think so. I don't really think -that was the intention at all. -[woman] ...footage. [Rachel] The local picture was in the newspaper. Did you call the newspaper and have them remove it? It was in the-- it was in the Huron Daily Tribune. [man on phone] No, they were not making an image. They were putting it how it was. They had no... no agenda. -[Jaclyn] Mom, you know... -[Rachel] Okay. Now there is an agenda behind the movie against racism, literally talking about it in the description... -[Jaclyn] Say, "The filmmaker will call you." -...in the link. I'm in the front of it. I got doxed because of this shit. -[Rachel] Well-- -[Jaclyn] Race-- racism is not being a Nazi? -What? -Yes. Okay, I'm sorry, if you wanna talk to the filmmaker, talk to the filmmaker, but you're not gonna talk to my manager like this. Leave the note. That's all I'm asking. Don't tell me to leave the note, I will leave the note. [woman 2 on phone] You're getting involved with things that you know nothing about. You're going to end up digging yourself your own grave. [Rachel] I'm digging a grave for myself now? -[Stephanie] Rachel, you don't owe them anything. -Wow. -[Rachel] I'm pretty sure... -She said we're gonna end up digging our own grave. I am not here to bring up or digging myself into a grave or anything like that. I'm trying to make sure there's a conversation so that we can live together, you know, among one another. I just want you to know that it's better to have conversations than threatening some restaurant that is not a part of it. [automated voice] If you'd like to make a call, please hang up-- [phone beeps] Mom, you have to dissociate yourself from that-- -You need to calm down. -[Raquel] No, Jaclyn, 'cause you're too hot. -Okay. -[David] Do you think we can call the police, though? I just got like a call from the-- the-- [clicks tongue] You know, the kids' face, the Nazi kid? He kinda made a threat, so, um, I was gonna call the police. But I wanted to let you know first. -I really don't wanna do this anymore. -[Jaclyn] Are you scared or not? 'Cause if you're scared, then the better thing to do would be dissociate yourself. I'm scared for the "Asian bitch." That's what I'm scared about. -I'm not scared for myself. -[Raquel] Jaclyn, well, you should be! I knew this was gonna happen the minute the backlash came from David. -I just-- it's-- -[Raquel] Exactly... David, you don't live here. You have no clue. [Raquel whispers] So stupid. -[David] Mom, I grew up here just like everyone else. -David, David. -But you really don't live here. -I don't, no-- -Exactly, so it doesn't cost you a damn thing. -[Raquel] Mom... [David] What happened today is gonna happen again when the film comes out itself. Like... do you want to carry through with this? As long as nobody gets hurt, then it's worth it. Like words... and threats and phone calls and mail and letters and messages, it's like those are just things. Like if that's the worst it's gonna be, then it-- then it's worth it. [Mike] You gotta stop thinking that they're dumb. Please! Because if you think they don't know this stuff, you're wrong. Okay, I'm not literally here to get my ass chewed out by Nazis and then by you. Jaclyn, you don't know what these guys are capable of fucking doing when you're by yourself. -I agree. -Okay, stop, stop, stop. -You belittled, like rightfully so... -Okay. Okay! ...belittled those guys in front of a lot of people. But like why-- do you think I really want to get like bitched at right now? You're mad 'cause I fucking care? Like, you-- No, I'm mad because, like, you're making it... because like you're making me feel worse and I just... I don't know what to do 'cause I'm scared the next time you have an interaction with them. I'm not thatstupid. [somber music] [Jaclyn] Who do you think you are walking in here with your guns and your fucking combat gear? And I guess I just wanted to make it a point, like, "You don't scare me." 'Cause in that moment, I wasn't scared. [chuckles] And I don't know if anyone else in this town could understand that. So I don't wanna have a long discussion and I don't feel like getting lectured. I just want to know if Mike and I can put a shotgun in the room upstairs that we sleep in just-- just in case. If you can't prove to me you can shoot... You want me to go load it right now? [keypad beeping] [Jaclyn] Safety is on. [clicking] -It's loaded. It's ready to go. Yeah, safety off. -It's loaded. -It's ready to go. -Lean, lean into the guns like this. Right there, just waiting. -[clicking] -[Chun] Just remember, even if a block that big, that still can save you. -Just like that. -[Jaclyn] Thank you. [music continues] [wind blowing] [car horn honking] [light dramatic music] [Chun] Yep. [gun clip clicking] [music continues] -[Raquel on phone] Dad? -I'm right here waiting for that guy. Walk out there all by yourself, get in your car, and drive in this way. You can make a big loop. -Go back to the front of the restaurant. -Okay. Baba, don't do anything dangerous. We want to make sure that somebody is not actually look for you, follow you. If there ends up any shooting, you stay down to the lowest floor as you can. -Is it her? -[Rachel] Yes. [music continues] [Raquel] There's not even as many of them as there usually are. [Rachel] There's two trucks coming right now. [Chun] Okay, now follows that truck up. They're right behind those guys. [Rachel] Yeah, they're following her. [Mike] They're also going straight. [Chun] That's okay, I'm right behind him. You'll be fine. [Rachel] They know I'm following them. -[Chun] The guy... [mumbles] -[Rachel] Oh, my God. [Chun] Piece of shit. [Chun] Just a bunch of high school kids -who got nothing better to do. -[phone dings] [Rachel] Well, I hope that's what it is. [Chun] That's all they are. [indistinct chatter] The last two nights I've come home, those... trucks that hang out outside the restaurant with their Trump flags and Confederate flags and All Lives Matter have tried following me. I think they can tell that they... freaked me out 'cause I definitely stepped on the gas. And they turned the other way, and it was just very uncomfortable, I don't know. I've just been very paranoid ever since, so... [chuckles] [TV playing in background] [Chun] They will come after you. Not likely right now. And if Trump happens to be in the office, you got a bunch of racists that can't wait. We have to constantly worry every night. I hope and pray that they don't hurt any of my family members because... I'm not the kind of father that can sit down and watch a trial. So be careful what you do and what you say. -We don't want you to not be passionate about... -You can't reverse it. That's-- that's probably one of the worst kind of hate ever. -But there's other ways that you can fight it. -[sniffles] If I have to explain to people why Black lives matter, tell them to take a look at that and what our country has suffered. [gentle music] [upbeat music playing over speakers] [Jaclyn] Oh, my God! -[Jaclyn] Where's my mom? -[Skyler] Out on the patio. -Is there anybody out there? -Yeah. -[indistinct chatter] -[Mike] What just happened? [Raquel] The Nazis got arrested. [Jaclyn] They just got arrested, two of them, Michigan State Police, got arrested yesterday, four felony charges against them. One of 'em is the ringleader of a white supremacy-- The guy is 25, Justen Watkins, he was just arrested. It's an ongoing story. They're going to prison. Holy shit! What a day for America. I was telling her, I'm-- like, we could be terrorized. And I'm like I'm not even worried about me. I'm worried about, like, you and them keeping an eye on you. And then you find out that these two guys actually did terrorize a family, like... That's how close I think this was. Put your camera down. The cops are coming. [David] What's that right there, Mike? That's the house. [wind blowing] -[officer] Morning. -[David] Hi, officers. -[officer] How we doing? -Good, how are you doing? I'm okay. Okay, and your-- I'm sorry, your family -owns what restaurant? -[David] Rachel's. Okay. [clicks tongue] All right, good enough. So, uh, potential that somebody might wanna talk to you -and maybe see your... footage. -Sure, sure. -Would that be all right? -Yeah. In the name of their white supremacist beliefs, FBI agents arrested 25-year-old Justen Watkins of Bad Axe and 35-year-old Alfred Gorman of Taylor this morning. Investigators say the two belong to a neo-Nazi group called the Base, which aims to carry out violent acts and incite a race war. The two are accused of terrorizing a family in Dexter mistakenly thinking they were at the home of a man who runs an anti-supremacist podcast. [announcer] Weekdays at noon and 5:30, coverage you can count on. -[guitar music on TV] -[man on TV] Michigan... a place where people respect each other. Every single person that went online and defended those people saying that it's their right -to show up... -[Mike] I have screenshots... And it is their right to show up. It is not your right to run a frickin' Nazi training camp to train people how to exterminate everybody except white people. Like, that is not your right. So all those people defending, and all those people who defended those Nazis, I hope they feel like frickin' asses. [somber music] [Chun] Some people will never understand what the power of hate and evil can do to a human being. But I do. Many people in the village died. But you don't care. You see people die all the time. You see people get shot. You see people get slaughtered. You see corpse floating around. And that's when my father began to say that if he stay there, he gonna be dead. He might as well try to get out, try to escape. I put my dad on a canoe, paddle him all the way across that river, drop him off, and hope that someday we'll meet again. But I never even get to shed one drop of tear. He never returned. All a sudden, one night they make a run for it. You can hear the bullets just flying across your head. Keep going, keep going. One day, next day, the following day. We made that journey to Thailand's border. For everything that I did, my mom and all six children survive. When we get into the Red Cross camp as a refugee with no country, where do you want to go? That's when Mom say United State of America. You can't wait for the plane to land. The flight attendant say, "Okay, you can get up now." For the first time in our life and probably... almost five years that we was greeting by a flower, hug, kiss, with love. With care... and with our dream of what America is. [music continues] [wind blowing] [Kat] Your dad is right. [chuckles] You need to re-write your love letter because it's not to the people of Bad Axe. -Yeah. -It's to your family -and what they've gone through... -Yeah. -...in Bad Axe. -Yeah. I think-- I think even just, um... growing up in Bad Axe has just shaped like so much of like who are family is. It's helped create this bond and, you know, for that I, like, I'm thankful, you know. It's a love letter to Bad Axe because... like, yeah, even though, you know, our family has our frustrations with Bad Axe, we still wouldn't be where we are today if we didn't have the community of Bad Axe, and that includes the people that have supported us and the people that haven't supported us. Because it's the people that supported us that continue to support our business and allow us to, like, achieve this American dream. And it's the people who haven't supported us who have only forced us that much closer together as a family and, you know, for that I'm thankful and, um... I'm thankful for Bad Axe for-- for doing that. That's why it's a love letter. [sentimental music] [Jaclyn] Bad Axe is home for me. It's hard to describe. And it's a place that I can one day maybe raise a family, kind of like how my parents moved here with their young kids and started a life. You want it to get better. You don't wanna just, like, write it off. And it's a place that I, like, see hope in it. [Skyler] I'm gonna take a lot away from how my parents raised me in a positive way, you know... I don't agree with everything on them, but... they really are good people, and I love them so much. Love conquers all. -[David] Why you drinking Fireball, Austin? -I... It's like tailgating season. It's chilly. [Raquel] Are you a little nervous? -Your first time voting. -[mumbles] [Raquel] It's okay. I was nervous my first time voting. [David] Do you feel like your vote's making a difference? This, like... [Austin] Well, not necessarily my vote, but the collection of votes this year, I think, is gonna make a difference. [David] Show me what you got, Austin. [Austin] A sticker. Voted, first time. [Jaclyn] How's it looking so far? Well, Iowa looks good. The margins are huge compared to like Clinton's. [man] You're seeing the map right now that's gonna make democrats nervous. If you look at this map right now, the name of the game, if you're Joe Biden, is takeaway because Donald Trump, the incumbent president, who won last time... -[David] How's it going so far? -I don't know. [light guitar music] -Feels a little, like, a bit like 2016. -[Jaclyn] Mmm, no... This feeling in my stomach, it does. [Raquel] Yeah, I feel that. I feel like I'm gonna wake up tomorrow and it's gonna be... [music continues] [man 1] Joe Biden has vaulted into the lead in the crucial swing state of Michigan, you can see it right there. [man 2] If Joe Biden wins Georgia or Pennsylvania, there is no path to 270 electoral votes for President Trump. We are currently in day four of election watching. [music continues] -[cat meows] -[David] Raquel wants to talk to you. Mike. Boo! Come on... [mumbles] [Raquel] Pennsylvania! [Jaclyn] Finally! God! Joe Biden's president. [Jaclyn] Oh, my God. What a long four years. [Raquel laughs] What a long four days. [both laughing] Oh... [man shouting] No! No! -Get that on video. -[David chuckles] [shouts] Fuck Joe! And they already know how we think. I guess if you're gonna make a stand and make this film, then you gotta... stand by it. I know times have been challenging, especially the last several months. But we've also witnessed your courage, your resilience, and the generosity of your spirit. And the road ahead will not be easy, -but America is ready. -[crowd cheering] Because we, the people, -have the power to build a better future. -[Jaclyn] Whoo! -[woman] Yeah! Wow. -All right, ladies and gentlemen. -[phone dings] -[Rachel] How'd you like to stay in that motel, David? -[David] Nope. -[Rachel] That's been there since I was a little girl. [emotional piano music] [Chun] Well, Mom, we miss you every day. [music continues] Been, uh... dreaming about you. So I thought it was a really pleasant dream. And, uh, when we drive by today, I just wanted to come visit. Come to visit you. I miss you. Miss you. -[music continues] -[indistinct chatter] This is the mom that brought all six of her children out of the Killing Field in Cambodia. It's incredible woman. She is incredible. [dramatic music] -[David] Can you read that? -Mmm... Yeah. Where did you find this? It was under a bunch of old photos. [Jaclyn] Come here. [exclaims, grunts] David, whenever I talk about Ma, I cry, like, instantly. "Dear Ma, I guess first and foremost, I miss you more than anyone could ever imagine. [voice breaking] I can't believe that it's already been a little over four years since you died. Often you come to me in my dreams, and I want to thank you for that. Thank you for everything you have done for me, and I promise I'll continue to try and make you proud. Love always and forever." I can see a lot of Ma in Baba, actually. They both have this strong will to survive and keep going no matter what. And I think that deep down Baba knows that me and him are very much alike. [David] Do you think that you and Baba are so similar in so many ways because of Ma? I guess I never really thought of that, honestly. [chuckles] That would make sense. What do you think you learned this past year? [Jaclyn] I don't think it's anything that, like, I learned. I think it just became more, like, cemented. I just know that I like being around my family all the time, but that's not new news. Like, I've always done this. I've always, like... Like, I just want to... be there for as many moments as I can. [uplifting music] [David grunts] -What does it say? -I don't know. Read it. [laughs] "David, ew, David." -What does it say? -What does yours say? Kat, you can put yours on too. [Kat] Just hold it up. This is for Kat. -Oh, my God. -Read your shirt. [chuckles] -[sniffles] -[laughs] [Jaclyn inhales] -[Jaclyn] I promise-- -Oh, I just ruined all my makeup. Okay. What do our shirts say? -Cat mom, cat... Dog mom, dog... -[chuckles] [Jaclyn giggles, laughs] What does your shirt say? [sobs] You swear to God? Why would I lie? [Raquel sniffles] [Jaclyn chuckles] [Raquel exclaims] [Jaclyn gasps, giggles] Careful. [Raquel sobbing, laughing] No way. Are you serious? She's for real? Oh, my God. -Oh, for real? -[Jaclyn] Mm-hmm. [music continues] I hope you're ready for this, babe. Wha?! [sobbing, laughing] [screams] What?! Ah! [hyperventilates] Did you see that? Did you see that? -[screams] -[Jaclyn laughs] -[Rachel inhales, exhales] -"Mommy and Daddy are get us -a human baby." -[Rachel laughs] [music continues] [Rachel cries, laughs] [sniffles] -[Chun] I love you. -[Jaclyn] I love you too. [chuckles] -[sniffling] -[Chun] Mm. [David] One, two, three, four. [upbeat guitar music] [singing "Champa Battambang"] Can I get two calamari, a fish and chips, and seafood bowl? [music continues] And order up! Pickup! [singing continues] -[Raquel shouting indistinctly] -[singing continues] Well, baby, we're waiting for you. You're in there right now. [Raquel] You're coming down the birth canal. You're coming down the birth canal, and, uh... -honestly, we can't wait to meet you. -Jaclyn! Jaclyn! Jaclyn! -[chanting continues] -[screaming] [cheering] [indistinct chatter] [all cheering and whooping] [Rachel] Oh, look at her eyes. They're really cool. -Hi. -Hi, beautiful. Look at you. [singing continues] -Yes. [giggles] -[cheering] [light guitar music]
