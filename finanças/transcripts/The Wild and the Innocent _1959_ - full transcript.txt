Soulless Den "Beautiful as the moon and the roses In soft and white dress Dancing with an angel all night long She's young and beautiful with a ribbon in the hair And a touch of rosy cheeks. A touch of pink on the cheeks A touch of red lips A touch on your blue eyes that matches the color of the sky A touch of pink A touch of red A touch of blue showing that her love is pure. I'm in paradise For I am the husband And I'll have her in my arms In your white and tidy house She walks with small steps And everywhere a touch of pink A touch of pink on the cheeks A touch on your red lips A touch of blue ... A touch of pink on cheeks A touch of red lips A touch of blue in your eyes that match the sky." Don't move, old man! Let's just say I have to decide Whether I'm going to kill you or not. Why don't you do it. Who are you? Lije Hawkes. She's my wife, Kiri, and my nephew, Yancey. Hawks? Does my name bother you? I'm willing to change it. Don't you think we deserve to see the ones who want to kill us? If we show ourselves we run the risk of killing each other. How about offering them a scotch? You have a shotgun pointing in the wrong direction. She's not even pointed in the right direction. One moment. I know that voice. What a dangerous joke! We could have killed you. You'd better sit down, Lije. You were scared. You're lucky to to be alive. I don't even know why. You don't sees nothing far from your nose. You've grown up, boy. How old are you now? I certainly don't know. Uncle Lije he can only count his fingers. Where have you been this whole time? Boy! We discovered lands in that no one has ever been. Mountains so high, you can see the state of Wyoming to Salt Lake. You see how far, Yancey? Us 80 km. His eyes still are not developed. I found thousands of skins to give to the mother. Thousands? More or less. Let's say eight hundred. Five hundred. A little more or less ... Healthy all first-rate. Come on, I'll show you no Ogilvie. We're not going. to the commercial warehouse. We're going to California. California? What can we hunt there? We want to be ranchers. They're going to trade the mountains for the ranches? You don't catch anything anymore. You need to go too far to find furs. But they will still be free to do so. Free to starve to death, also. There are no bison. Come with us, Lije. We're going to sowe grain. When I go west it will be because we lost everything. What about you, Yancey? There's enough land and a shortage of labour. You. Take. This conversation is leaving the whiskey sour. Let's go before we stay drunks and we plant turnips. Left! Left. California? California. Did you hear that? Let them go. They're going to regret it. Farmers! We're waiting for you. As long as they take off their shirt. I knew they were rats from the earth since I met them. Easy, girl! Calm! Easy, girl! Easy, Sal! What's the point with her? It's probably because you keep yelling. You're right, you're right. You said we only killed five hundred beavers in two years. It's true, it's true. It still hurts. In 1840, I hunted five thousand skins only in one season. And that was repeated in 1870. At that time, there were beavers in droves. And we captured all of them. By the millions. Yes, sir! We captur?vamos. Drug. I bet there will be so few hunters this year who won't even take care of of drinking a barrel of Bourbon. I'll have a drink with you if you want. You're not too young to drink yet. And besides, it tastes terrible. It's Sal again. She makes me nervous. If we hadn't killed many beavers... I don't know, i don't know If you want to be a rancher, Yancey ... I don't give a. Rancher? Why would I want that? You're an adult now. Soon You're going to want to get married. Absolutely not. You're strong. You'll soon want it. Let's see. You need money to get married. If you'd gone to a city, you'd know. Women like to beautiful things. Some don't even agree to live in a house with no windows! The Bible says: "Wherever you go, I'll go." So if she loves me, she'll wherever we go. Perhaps. but the Bible doesn't talk about us. What if she doesn't love me? Then no one could love her. I'm going to go check on Sal. - You're so agitated you're going to cause a colic in the foal. Easy, Sal. Ten Lije! Good aim, boy. In fact, it was best shot... i've ever seen. He's not going to die, is he? Pours. How's he doing? Like last night. I want to see him. No! You've been up all night. We spent a lot of time together. I was happy. Hunters wanted to have me... But don't marry me. He was married to me. I'm the only one taking care of him. I'm hungry! Come on, I'm really hungry. That bear made me lose dinner last night. Tell Ogilvie, that I want a real whiskey. You gave me a list. Remember? Look not to lose her. There will be no loss. Spend a week there if you want. I like bear meat. You want to receive something, special, Kiri? Yancey. She likes surprises. Swallow something extravagant. Let me go! Come on, stop it! You want to kill me? Let me go! What do you want? Let me go! I told you! Mr. Ogilve! What's the matter with you? Let him go. I haven't even started yet! That's it, that's enough! That's enough, Mr. Ogilve. I should have killed him. Useless garbage! Look what they've done. And a lot of drinks. They arrived yesterday in a wagon with children and with a barrel of whiskey. They traded with the Indians on the sly and they went crazy. They burn down the warehouse? They were singing and dancing. Only the blanket of one of them caught fire. I've never seen anything burn so quickly. When I found him here, I wanted to kill him. It wouldn't change anything. But it would make me more satisfied. Sell homemade whiskey to the Indians! I've never sold even mine best whiskey. Three and a half liters to a dollar. Goodbye, young man. Goodbye? Where are you going? Return to civilization and Quiet Chicago life. Let's go! We need food! Where can I sell these skins? Em Casper. In the general warehouse. Casper? Good afternoon. I want to thank you for what you did. He almost broke up with me. My name stocker. Ben Stocker of Kentucky. Have you ever been there? No. I had a farm there. The rains destroyed her. Then I came to Ohio. It was the drought. Tell me, these are the skins? So in Iowa I produced feed. But I hurt my back. Now we're going to Oregon. I hope to open a store there. They're beautiful. They're top notastage. Where do you sell them? Em Casper. It's two days away from horse. When do you plan to go? Tomorrow, mules need rest. Maybe I can avoid your trip. Do you like a good drink? I don't drink. I understand. unless have something to celebrate. I have homemade whiskey... I said I don't drink. No offense. I'm looking for make a deal. These are, in fact, good skins. Are you married? No. What's your name again? I didn't tell him. Irrespective of. Let's make a deal. Rosalie! Rosalie! It's mine. Rosalie... I hate having to give it up, but for half of their skins, You're going to have a beautiful wife. A wife? Clear. She knows how to sew, cooking and plowing land. Come closer, so that he can see her. Do you see it? She talks little and eats little too. What do you say to that? Agree? People don't get married like that! Why not? It must be love, First of all. Love? That's a good one. Who told you that? Forget it. Believe me, that's silly! Stay away from me. Wait a minute. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe half of these skins be a lot. I'm willing to renegotiate. Get out there! No, have mercy. Let's go although. We're leaving tonight. Don't hit me. I'm sick. I have a problem with my spine. God was wrong to leave people like you have children. Now, get out! The only thieves I I know are the coconuts. And I always shoot them. I wasn't stealing. Honestly. my wagon It's right over there. We'll be right there. No, have mercy. Don't shoot me. I was just lending it to you. some furs for my wife. She never had any, and I thought that she would gladly ... in having some ... Skins. For your wife. God. You're amazing. If you need anything, get me Say it and I'll get it for you. Sure? Don't move, don't move! What are you doing here? I was going to prepare your breakfast. You're Rosalie, aren't you? Am. What are you doing here? I was going to prepare your breakfast. Why is that? Why aren't you with your family? I ran away from the wagon while they slept. It was the stupidest thing. I've heard. Your father must be coming back, to beat him up. And he'd be right. He would be happy to get rid of me. Why is that? Dad lied. I eat a lot. Stop talking so low. Dad lied to you. I have a big appetite. One thing was true, You're not very talkative. I speak a lot yes ... when i don't I'm scared, i'm scared. So don't be afraid, okay? I mean, look at me. Look at me, look at me! Say-me because You're back. I would be traded with the first one that appeared ... Come on, talk about it. You said you were going to Casper, and I figured who could get a job there. Not to marry a stranger. If you take me. Para Casper? I can't do that. Why is that? I have things to do there. I can't take you. Go back to your family. Come on, let's go. Listen. I don't admire your father, But you're his daughter. And if necessary, I'm going to take her myself. I'm not going back. Very good. No way you want. You can stay here alone. I don't give a. I don't give a. Stop looking at me like so. I told you to stop! I can't take her. Never I took a girl nowhere. What would I do with you? You're too dirty. We had soap, but the baby ate him. I don't care what the baby did. I have to go to Casper and be back in a week. Stop looking at me like that. Don't stand there like that. If you're going to make breakfast, Do it soon. Where did you learn to play the harmonica? With my Uncle Lije. We've been singing all night. It must be wonderful. We never listen to music. They don't even sing? No, Dad doesn't like songs. Only if it's prayer. But I could listen to music without stop. I don't know why. Music is like wine for thirsty souls. I read that in a book once. Can you read too? A little. I've read the Bible, The Pilgrim. And Ivanhoe twice. There are beautiful things in the books. I wish I could read. Maybe one day you can learn. I'd like that very much. It's not easy. Uncle Lije taught me with tobacco boxes. Could you teach someone? I think so if i had time. No matter how much time lead, Yancey. You must leave for Casper before noon. Have you ever been to a big city? No. Me neither. I'll be busy to worry about you. Do you know how to look for a job? I ask people, as my father does. I can't imagine your father. looking for work. One day he asked, but was arrested on the train for stealing a horse. If we hadn't begged and cried, he would have been hanged, That must have been awful. Terrible. We really we needed that horse. "Welcome to Casper and the National Festival of 4 july" What a party more noisy that one. Wow!! What an amazing thing! What? It's going to be a rodeo, a ball, a lecture ... about amusement fairs. True celebration. I've never seen anything like it. Me neither. This should be fun. You know what? If I sell the skins and find a place for you, Maybe I'll go see what it's like. On this day of national celebration, we must renew ... Wow!... it's a city. Wyoming Great Territory belongs to the United States. Vote for Jack Spear, ladies and gentlemen. What a crowd.

They spend several months with the cattle and then come back looking for beautiful girls. They're not bad. That guy wanted to... A man can look that same animal. Chip? He's not a man. Not yet. He's just a drunk, with a gun in his belt. Why do you allow he carry a gun? It's not prohibited by law. That's not right. There are dangerous animals here. I could shoot anyone. That's embarrassing. Are you badly hurt, Yancey? Nothing. Marcy will disinfect. Marcy? Marcy Howard. She saw the fight from the window. She was worried about you. She's in there. Between. No, I'm fine, sir. I have to sell the skins and go home. Why don't you stay for the festivities? Your wife will like it. She's not my wife, we're traveling together, that's all. She came looking for a job.

I have to find her. Come back here. Let him go, Richie. Miss? Miss? Are you okay? You again. Get the hell out of here. I just wanted to thank you, for asking the sheriff to save me. Thank you very much. But I confess that ... I wanted to meet her, too. You're the most beautiful woman that I've ever seen in my life. I hope you ... Miss? You're doing much better. You're very good. Do you know why? Because I'm selfish. Because I have it just for me. I like to see the wind blowing in your hair, And see the brightness of the sun on your face ... and the color of the eyes, when is surprised. As they are now. They're common brown. I have the best seen throughout the county. And I don't see anything common in you. What I see is very nice. Hello. How do you feel? A little dizzy. What time is it? The sun's set. Rest more, you're tired. Drunk. Was completely drunk. You took care of of me all this time? You helped me when I needed it, Miss Howard. Miss Howard? Why are you so polite? I'm not intimate to call you, Marcy. But I'd be honored if I could. You are Being honest, aren't you? Of course I am. Why did you do that? What is your name? Yancey Hawks. Yancey, you can't imagine that made me feel. Here, no one believes in education. I can't imagine why... With you. What? It's the first time I've been out of the mountains. I don't know anything about cities. The last time anyone had That care for me was my mother. Not because I was of hangover. When was that? It must be a hundred years ago. Looks like the ball it's going to start. I've got to get back. 'M late for work. Thank you. What would happen if you don't work one night? Nothing, why? You want to come with me at the dance? Here? Oh no, it's impossible. Because of me? You can tell me if it is. No, it's not that. I'd like to go with you, but... Women in the city ... yes, what happens to them? Are not much ... friendly with me. I'd react like this if it looked like with them. There's nothing to be afraid of. No, I'm not afraid. I do what I want. Only... I dream about it ever since I saw her. It's okay, it's okay. You've done well. Goodbye, Yancey. I can't go without you. Why not? I don't know how to dance. You're going to find someone to teach you. Listen. I'm very clumsy. I need to learn from someone who's not afraid of anything. Come. Get up there. Is it better this way? Vire-se, Rosalie. It's perfect. You look beautiful. Sew like this tomorrow Della. Tonight. Tonight, huh? Della can't sew and cook at the same time. She's going to cook and you will sew. I haven't sewed in twenty years... Of. Take all the time you need. I want a special dinner, okay? Yes, Mr. Paul. Count me in. Thank you. You look beautiful. Incredible. An important night. Everything to tidy up and I have to sew. Go up again. Let's see what I can do. What's the thing with you? I do not know. It's not appropriate at all. Sometimes I give myself evil and it's for real ... Do you know how lucky you are? No, you don't know. Take a good look at yourself. Look. So if you're dressed, Think you can become better? If you were a cook or cleaner? No, ma'am. I'm sure you don't. Even if i worked to life all. I don't intend to work your whole life. So what do you have in mind? I hope to get married one day. Actually? With whom? Did someone ask her to marry him? No, ma'am. What if they never ask? Have you thought about it? Listen. The young women who work For me, they make good money. They have a percentage of every bottle sold at the bar. That's all I ask. Only make customers drink. Any way you want. If they're smart, save money. And if they're foolish enough to want a husband, for example, this is with them. Is it better? But I never convinced someone drinking. You learn. Place the tray on the table and take your eyes off her. Did you see it? It is easy to convince a man drinking. This one's for you. Courtesy of the boss. It's from the private reservation. I thought you was the boss. No, really, i don't. The boss is Paul. One, two, three. One, two, three... How am I doing? Very good. One, two, three... I think I understand now. When I tell Uncle Lije That I danced, you know what you're going to say? I have no idea. "You should have brought the girl here!" He talks like that. What am I supposed to tell him? I would say ... she's a city girl who doesn't want to get out of there. Never? Not this girl. I hope to change your mind. Come on, I think it's ready to really dance. Do the count. One, two, three. One, two, three... Quietly. Shame on you. It's a scandal. Let's go. What's the big deal? Why did you stop dancing? I tried to warn you. Let's go. If you want to look as long as we have fun, let them look. Yancey ... Let's show them what they're missing. If you don't go with me, I know what Uncle Lije will say. "If this girl is all you said, it would be foolish not to go back to her. " You wouldn't do that, would you? Would, if you are not ... You can't say that. Then come with me. Nobody gives me cake, least of all you. I've been sick. But now it's better. You're with me. Lady? Did you hear him? The lady! Please. You never said it, did you? He's an ass, but you should know.
