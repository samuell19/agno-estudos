A perfect day for dying. Already 38, but no wife or kids. No home. No money. And of course... no job. Absolutely nothing. What I do have is... a debt of 3.2 million yen, and a criminal record. Saitama Music Station. Fax from Spring Breeze in Koshigaya. "Hello, Jumping Smash Yamada." Hello. "The cherry blossom viewing season is upon us." "I'm inviting someone I like that's indifferent to me. Advice, please!" That's easy! Force them to the ground under the tree... and confess your love to them! "Darling, darling, let me embrace you!" It's worked for me for all of my 39 years. It's most important to use force. Making good sushi also needs a bit of force... Awful! It stinks! Do your farting in the toilet! Who? What's going on? Going to prep school. So get going! It's too late. Then go home. Get out of there! What are you doing? This little brat has a cell phone, I can't even buy cigarettes. Go home, go home! No way, no way! I ran away. Ran away? Yeah, I brought my stuff. I faked going to school. Forget that, just go home. Where do you live? Right there. House with the big garden. That place? To get big money fast, my surprising advice is to kidnap. Don't tell anyone, but it's easy to take from the rich. All my blood, sweat and tears as a... greatly-feared thief have taught me the rules of sure success. It is a perfect kidnapping. Hey... Come and listen. I'll tell only you. What's your Dad do? Owns lots of companies. Company president... Rule One. Get hold of a cell phone. One that can't be traced. Got one. Rule Two. A kid who doesn't know you. I don't know him at all! Rule Three. Not in your neighbourhood. What's your name? Jyo. Your surname? Know what that means? Shinomiya. I see, nice name. Your age? Six, but I'll be seven soon. Really? A good age. Mister... Your cheeks are twitching. Because I'm sick. So... can I use your cell phone? Sure. Rule Four. Kill the kid right away. Never forget that. It's the most important thing. That's how I messed up. Compassion got in the way. The kid knows your face. If the kid's alive, they'll chatter away... You're done for. Here. Hey, can you read this? What for? I hate tests. Test? Right, it's a test. Listen, if you pass this test, we can run away together. Really? Really. Great, I'll do my best. I know! You can read it? It's a simple character. The difficult characters... No way, I can't read them. Alright, you pass! I did? Good job! Not really... Next, describe features of my face. Features? How would you describe me to people? A mouth under your nose, eyes above your nose, and hair on your head. You're amazing. Actually, two eyes. Good, you pass! Really? That means... everything is okay! Hello, how may I help you? Mrs Shinomiya? Yes, who is calling? Well, who can it be? Fujimoto from KO Prep School? Sorry, you're wrong. To tell the truth... Maybe it's from Jyoto Bank? Wrong again. I know, Mr Fukuzawa from Congress? I guess your son isn't home yet? Not yet, but he'll be home soon. I have your son with me. I'm sorry, so that's why he's late. Is he bothering you? I'm so sorry! That's not it at all! I have kidnapped him. Kidnapped! Cock a doodle doo. I abducted your kid. Such a joker! It's no joke! That's impossible. Of all things... My son? Prepare cash for his safe return. Is he alright? For now. However... His voice, let me hear Densuke's voice. Densuke! Densuke? Hey kid, who's Densuke? That's my name. Didn't you say Jyo? That's my nickname. I look like Jyo Poppo in Samurai Game. Prepare 10 million... no, 20 million yen. By evening. What? 20 million yen? Well, I do have that much here... Okay, 50 million yen! Oh my, that will take time. At least let me hear his voice. Oh no, Jyo Poppo was beaten! Your Mom is on the phone. Talk to her. Hi there, Mom! I'll call again. Do not contact the police! Why'd you call Mom? Well, I... Was she mad? I should have gone to prep school. You understand your situation? Situation? I've been fooling you. Actually, I'm a bad guy, real bad! Don't laugh! Don't seem like a bad guy. But I am. If you behave, you'll return home. But if you cause trouble... it'll cost you. No! I'm being good, so don't send me home! Huh? Right, you ran away. In that case, I'll help you run away. Things happened, I'm moving around a lot. I'll take you with me. Really? Really. Good! How much do I have to pay? But you just said so, "it'll cost me." Oh, that's right, running away takes money. So, how much you got? Not enough? Bit short, but it's okay. Plus your phone. Sure. Mister... thanks. Thank you. Let's go! Let's go! Good! Shinomiya Sir. What's up? Well... Boss? My son's been kidnapped. Kidnapped? Your boy? It can't be! Really? Contact the police... We can't! Shut up. Another gang? Sorry to trouble you with this. Search for my son. Please. Boss, don't beg us. We'll catch that kidnapper and kill him! Just search for him. I'll do the rest. I want to go to Granny's house. First we'll sneak far away. If we stay here, your people will come searching. That's true. Pee time! Hold it in. I'll leak! You can go there. Huh? Not in a toilet? Never peed outdoors? Never. Can't believe it! All guys do it. Here's a good place. Not facing me! By my side! Hang on. Check the wind. Can't stand downwind. Good. Get ready, pee! Shoot! Shoot! Shake it off. Shake, shake... More, shake, shake! Search harder, idiot! Search. Through search! Let's get going. The boy stays within this red line. Shall I get the boys to do a thorough armed search? Idiot! What if the cops see? Stay low. Yes, sir! Can't we do a lost child search? It also uses GPS, SEARCH: Densuke but the phone's turned off. What'll we do? Wait until the phone's on and they call us. Nothing but wait. Come here! Quiet down! Get out! Kishida, you ready? Yes. Hello. Shinomiya residence? Y... Yes. Shi... Shinomiya here. The husband? Y... Yes. Not the police? N... No. R... Really. R... Really, I am. Got the 50 million yen? Well, somehow I managed. For the sake of the kid, don't call police. I... I understand! I... I understand! Okay. I'll call again. Within 500m radius of Ikebe. Ikebe! Good, let's go now. The boy may not be with him. Sakurada! Continue to monitor all calls. Right. You all understand? Catch him during the cash pick-up. Not like doing solo crime. Sir! I'm starving! Be a man, put up with it. I can't stand it! You're so spoiled. An only child? Correct! How about you? Had a younger brother. But where is he now? Where? I don't see him. So, what is your Mom like? Mom? Well then, your Dad? Scary! Don't be so scared, resist him sometimes. "Resist?" Stand up to him. It's important in life. If you just do what you're told you'll end up being a loser. Be a man and show courage. How do I do that? Lots of ways, like run away on a stolen bike. I can't ride a bike. I see... Well, for example, leave home. Hey, I am resisting him! Oh, that's right, great resisting! Resist? Boy soldier Jyo Poppo resisted the King, and met a legendary hero. But resisting makes me hungry... Convenience store! Yeah, convenience store! Yes! Convenience store. You like them so much? I've never eaten one of their box lunches. Let's go! Wait! Wait! You can't go, stay here. But why not? Remember the security camera. If your parents see you, your resisting is over. True. Yeah. After trying so hard. So hard! I'll wait here. Good. Okay. A disguise? Well, yeah... Now I get it! You also ran away from home. That's right. Just wait here. Sorry. Welcome! Welcome! Warm it up? Warm it up? No... Okay? 1,860 yen. 1,860 yen. You okay? You okay? Here, Mister. "Hideyoshi Date" Hey! How may I help you? What's this? I'm Jyo Poppo, rescuing the legendary hero. I said to wait! I have a disguise. Back to the car! Alright. Now! 1,860 yen, please. That was great, like everybody says. Really good! Thank you. You don't want to go home? A little bit... But I ran away from home. I'll put up with this to resist Dad. This is fun, like camping. I'll call Mom to say goodnight. No, you can't, they'll find us. That's true. But I wonder, was running away the best thing? Couldn't talk it over? Why not? To talk to Dad I'd have to sit straight, and explain it logically. Dad, please allow me to go to Tetsu's school. The purpose is fun, please permit it. And then he'd say, Fun is no reason! Wham! He's hit you? Course not! Slammed the door. When he left the room. Mom just says "Do what your Dad says." Said he'd take me to Granny's, but never did... Hey, go inside to sleep. They're pretty. Really pretty. It was fun today. Hey, go inside, you'll catch cold. Just a bit longer. What was your Dad like? A drunk. Hit, kick and rampage. Good for nothing loser. I see. So you resisted and ran away. Wish he were alive. Can't resist a dead father. You look foolish. That's noisy. Buenos dias! You can play catch anytime. Even if your Dad's busy, he'll do that much. No, we've never played. Really? So you can't play? I can so! Anytime! With who? The wall. Sounds lonely. We'll play catch sometime. Really? Here's some breakfast. Thank you. The boys will help. You idiot! Help her! Being busy keeps me calm. This is all I can do. Forgive me. Listen up! We'll track him in real time with this. Money. Listen, handing over the money is our best chance! Don't let the kidnapper escape. Right. Now eat! Thank you. Please help... Make it work... 50 million yen... What's that? Octopus? Mom. Drawing takes more than hands. Well then... Wrong. Head. Use your head to draw. With my head? Like this? Wrong again! So what do I do? Close your eyes, imagine what you want to draw. What I want to draw? Right. Draw your Dad. Dad? This is Fujimoto, KO Prep School, where genius begins. Densuke was absent today, if this continues... Fujimoto here, call got cut off... He really bugs me. Should worry about himself. What a nuisance. Shinomiya? Is the money ready? Y... Yes, 50 million yen. Family restaurant by Route 16. Go there at 11:30 exactly. Get a window table. You must go alone. Do not contact the police! I mean it! Really mean it! B... But let me hear his voice. Please. Mister, look! Don't attract attention! Who's that? Dad. Water please! You sell cigarettes? Excuse me! Excuse me, water refill... Certainly, just a moment. Yes. Hello? Hello? Didn't contact police? O... Of course not, I didn't. Is that true? Alright, listen carefully because I won't repeat this. Leave the restaurant and get in your car. After you leave there I'll instruct you. You got it? Yes? Signal from 300m radius of restaurant. Understood. Within 300m radius. Search! Endo, the rear. Right. Way to go! Everything's going well. Next step is crucial, Rule Five. Taunt and irritate them. Let's go! Yes, Shinomiya here. You love the kid. From Iwatsuki Interchange, drive north east. Then head north, driving 80kph in the slow lane. You got it? Where is that guy? Not where he said. But he's close. Lost the signal. Crap! Everything's going well. Oh, not good. What's going on? This "M&M play" is no fun. Guess not. What's "guess not" mean? Well, it's almost time. Where is here? Is Granny's near here? Yeah. O, gracias! Thank you. You didn't forget our promise. Course not. Promises are made to be kept. Promises are made to be kept. Cool! Think so? Yeah, cool. "Saitama Police Dept" Something stinks. Smell it, Inspector? Diabetes? Not talking about that! I mean the Shinomiya gang. That? All gone since yesterday. Maybe cherry blossom viewing? But also the Sakurada and Endo gangs. I see... We'll report to the Division Head before taking action. Today we'll observe. Wait! What are you doing? Let's get going. Where? To observe the situation. Go alone. Wait! My animal instinct tells me this is major. We'll get promoted! Really? Let's go. Wait! I gotta crap! Inari sushi, octopus, tuna, mackerel... Kurosaki here. Hi, Honey. It's you, dear! What's up? Sorry, I'll be a bit late. What? Tetsu's school entry event is today. I know, I'll be home as soon as possible. You sure? Please try. Keep your promise to Tetsu. Number of times I've broken promises to Tetsu is... quite a lot. See you, bye. Ciao. O, rio, ancho rio! What'd you say? Spanish for "Oh, river, big river!" But can't read Japanese! Que sera, sera. What? Oh, train! Musashino Line 205 type! You know a lot. I love trains! Want to ride trains! Never rode a train? I have! Many times. Kindergarten first year, second year, and final year. I want to be a conductor. Not a driver? No. Won't run your Dad's company? I can't, second generator can't take over. Generator? Oh, generation. That means you're like a... Yeah? A kabuki actor? Hello? Reached the service area? Y... Yes. Exit at Tatebayashi Interchange, take Tohoku Railway towards Oyama. Go back? Don't want to? It's okay. Which train should I take? Arrive at the station by 3 PM. Then take the first train leaving. Densuke, got some balloons. Thanks, Mister! Let's go see trains. My job is almost done. One, two, three... four. Bad luck, four is death! Lend me the pencil. Fixed that! Long time since I rode a train. Kids are a nuisance. I don't have a family. I failed as a yakuza. But you're a good Dad. Mr Shinomiya? Yes. Move to a window on the left side. I did. Want me to drop the money? Right. Smart guy. My son? I won't pay until I get him back. Ready? Listen carefully. Didn't call the cops, but my thinking has changed. Hey, you hear me? Yeah. Think this old fashioned way will work? Tell me your bank account number. First I'll deposit 10 million yen. After he's safely returned, I'll pay the rest. I promise no one will hurt you. No way. Why? It's a nuisance. Then this transaction... What? What's up, Dad? That's enough! I'll decide things now, otherwise... Otherwise what? Please, take me in his place. Please, return my son. Please, please... I will if you do what I say. He's near Shinagawa Park. Wait here, don't move. Hey, where you going? Train's coming. Really? Yeah. Train, train! Train, train. Hello? Drop the bag at the next crossing. My son? Holding red balloons. Almost there. I understand, red balloons. Densuke... Wait! You promised! Hey, stay there. Promised! Mister! Where? Kishida said around here. Kin, red balloons! Right! I did it, I did it! Bastard! We'll kill you! Stop! Stop! Hey! Ouch! You lousy! Sorry, sorry. That hurt! Why'd you come back? What's wrong? Quick! Your seat belt! Hey you, stop! Stop! I'll kill you! That was close, they almost caught you. But why were Kin and Taka there? Who is Kin? You know, the guy chasing you. Taka was behind him. How do you know their names? With Dad's company. Maybe they were searching for me? Company staff? Densuke, tell me something. Yes? What's your Dad's occupation? A company. Not that! What does he do? Contractor? Money? Gambling? "Robin Hood." Dad calls it that, but most people don't. He takes pride as "Robin Hood." What do most people call it? I forget. Starts with ga... Gasoline? No. Garages? Not that. Gallery? Wrong. I know! Garbage collection! Almost, you're getting closer. Ga... Gang... Gangster! Right! You win, you win! Get out. Get out now. Huh? Why? Why?! Wait! Tell me why! You can't stay. You said we'd take a trip! Get out! I'm a really bad guy. A kidnapper! A kidnap? Alright, I'll take a nap! But let's go now. Conditions have changed. What does the word conditions mean? Please, everything will work if you're not here. "Hideyoshi Date" You draw better now. I won't go, I won't go! Don't want to go home! How do you know my name? Saw it at the convenience store. Picked up your driver's license. But you can't read... Learned historical names at prep school. Like Hideyoshi Toyotomi and Masamune Date. Densuke, don't tell your Dad who I am. No, you broke your promise, so I will too! What promise? You said you'd take me to Granny's. It's mean to forget. Like Mom and Dad! You promised! Promised, promised! But you... Promises are made to be kept. Right? I'll do it! I promise! I promise. Kishida, where's the kidnapper? Seems the GPS isn't working. There's no signal. What? I'll die to atone! I will too! Die! Die! But first, did you see his face? Boss, it's ready. Search here for his face. Y... Yes. Stop! Yes. That's him. Zoom in. Yes. Definitely him! It's him. Good. Print this out and give it to everyone. Yup! Not yup, idiot! Sir! You guys, go to Saito Construction. Go? How'll we find? How? Telephone book, idiot! Read the license plate? Can't read the start, sorry. I think I know this logo... Beside the highway. Brown haired guy... Right. Endo, you go. I think it's there. Let's go. The rest of you look for this car. He's probably nearby. Sir! Lousy punk. Something's going on when this many bosses meet. Okay, tell the Division Head and request back up. But we don't know yet... Go back, we'll act when something happens. Something happened! I knew it, serious trouble! What you doing? We'll get promotions! I have to keep a promise. Kuribayashi, stop! For our promotions! Old hag's a loudmouth. Always that Osaka dialect. So loud. I'm sure this is it. Excuse me, we're coming in. What's going on? Relax, sit down. This your car? And this man? It's Hide... Knew it. Where's the kid? Is he here? Hey, boy! Stop that! Tell me where! Endo, stop! Kurosaki? Mr Kurosaki' to you. Sit down! Why are you? What about you? House repair... Illegal to enter without a warrant, and caused damage. Madam, file a damage claim? Want to claim? No? You're lucky. Goodbye... Kuribayashi, see them off. Let's go. Faster! Excuse us! May I ask some questions? Did they cause that cut? Course not, I just fell. Hide did it. Hide? I'm sure those guys are searching for Hide. He borrowed money from some bad people. Maybe he was in trouble, and hit my husband to get money. I just fell, you stop that chatter. Is Hide your boy? Our employee. Hideyoshi Date. But he treats him like a son. Even so... Stop the chatter and tidy up! But you're... Shut up! That's enough, but where's Date now? So we were... Don't know. He's on holiday. Gave him time off. And lent the car. Could you tell me details? There are no details! Now get out. Throw purification salt! What's going on? They don't seem to be involved. Kurosaki! Boy? Eel, egg, soybean, Inari sushi, octopus, tuna, mackerel... Hello? Hi, Honey. Darling? Sorry! I can't make it. What?! Have to work late? That's too bad. Are you mad? I'm not mad. You seem to be mad. I'm not mad! I love you. Who are you guys? Really bugs me. It's ringing. Woman? Don't touch! Shut up! From Kishida. Huh? What's this mean? It's that guy. Should be easy. Grab 50 million yen. Take over gang. Want to get him? Let's do it! Yakuza will manage to find you anywhere. Slash open your jugular. Blood spurts and spurts! Crap! I can tell you. You'll run away, break your promise, Densuke will be mad. He'll tell his Dad, who'll pursue you. Blood will spurt. Turn myself in? Turn yourself in? Break promise, make Densuke mad. Things happen, Dad gets mad. In the end, blood spurts. So making Densuke mad is the end of me? Try to keep him happy. There's nothing in my rules about a yakuza's son. Anyway, good luck. That's not fair, Shige! You told me it would be okay! It'll be okay, good luck. You said it was a perfect plan, you fool! Darn it! Idiot! What's wrong? Nothing. It's okay. Densuke, let's go to your Granny's house. You mean it? Yeah, but in return don't tell your Dad my name. Alright. That's a promise. Promises are made to be kept. So, where is Granny's house? Nanakuri. Where's that? Let me think... Only been there once. I can't remember. Sure it's called Nanakuri? Could be Kurikuri instead. Kurikuri? Found him! Come here, come here. Here. It's just like Jyo Poppo! What? Come here, let's play. I'm returning Densuke, here. Densuke? I don't know these guys. Huh? Don't work for your Dad? Hey boy, let's play! Take it! Densuke, what are you doing? Densuke, Densuke. Mister, pass! Forget passing! Huh? Densuke! Stop! Where'd you learn that? Cherry taught me. Cherry? Stop! Where are you? Can't be! Densuke? Don't fool us! Crap! Don't fool us! Take that! Give it to me. Run, Densuke, run! Mister, the bag. You had it? Shorty! Densuke, run, run. Give it to me! This? That! Here. Did it, great! Got it. Densuke. Did it! Here, Mister. Brought it again? Fooling us! You guys! Thanks. I understand, put the bag down. Drop it, it'll be over. Really? You promise? I promise. Promises are made to be kept. Right. Quick! Get going! Densuke, run. Run, run, Densuke! FROM: Masaru SUBJECT: Success! Got money, 2 escaped. Wait hideout. Densuke! Densuke! Come! Hey, Densuke! We did it. Densuke. Mister, you fought such scary guys! Your friends are more scary. We're like a brave legendary hero and a boy soldier! Right, let's go! Tomorrow... School entrance event. Let's go. What'll you do? Don't steal! It's not stealing, just borrowing. I'll return it later. One night rental, like a video. In that case it's okay. Here goes. Great, like a real thief! Stop admiring and get in! I am, geez. Excuse me a moment. Hey! Smoking? You're to blame! What? Carrying a gun you can't use, loser! Ouch! Stop that! Hey! What's going on? Sorry. Boss, it's moving? Kishida, what's this mean? Kishida did it! We found the money, but there's no boy. Sorry. Kishida asked us to do it, sorry. Alright. He wasn't there. Raise your head, fool! Hey! Kishida, I'll ask one last time. Are you involved in the kidnapping? Like I told you, I just tried to grab the money. You were giving away 50 million yen for your kid. Isn't that really our money? It's all over now, Dad. It's all over! The boss of the entire Shinomiya gang, pushed around by an irrational amateur. Having a kid made you an old fool. Kishida, enough! Let me say my final words. Time for a change. If I was head, I'd change everything. If you love your kid so much, better retire right away, Dad. I'm sorry. I wasn't a good Dad. Hey. Get him out of here. Sir! Get up! Where's Granny live? There is no Nanakuri. Wait, I'll try hard to remember. Huh? Where was that place? Kazushi Ito, 29 years old, I'm hungry! Convenience store box lunch! Okay, I'm Kazushi Ito, going to buy a box lunch. Who's Kazushi Ito? That's my name. Kazushi Ito, 29, living in Omiya Ward, Saitama City. Not true, you're Hideyoshi Date. Who's that? Your name, Mister. My name is Kazushi Ito. Try to get it right. I saw your license. This one? Da... can't read the next. Or the next, that's weird. I know, you read the first letter and felt like you read it all. You said keep it secret from Dad. But keeping a name secret isn't good. Your Dad may get mad, but I'm Kazushi Ito. Truly get mad if you must! I am Kazushi Ito! Kazushi Ito, Kazushi Ito. Understand? Right, a name with Date and Hideyoshi is funny! Ridiculous! It sure is! Kind of... Let's eat something good. Like it? Some rice. Thanks. Octopus, tuna, mackerel... Don't hold back, order anything you want. What'll I choose? Fatty tuna! Deluxe fatty tuna. Sorry, deluxe! Coming up! What are you celebrating? Well... We're taking a risk. A risk! That's special! Really? Here it is. Thanks. Here we go! Dad, Dad! Rice on Dad's face, too. Thanks. Like father, like son. Excuse me, squid please. Squid coming up! That was good! Glad you liked it. Can I buy you something? I'd like a ball. That's all you want? Come on! They've got them! This one. Mister, this one. For playing catch. Good idea. That's everything. Hold the box. Fool. Loof! Funny. Here! "Densuke Shinomiya." Are we at Granny's? How can we go when I don't know where it is? No more running away. Go home. Stop resisting. No way! What's stop resisting mean? Well? We can't resist more! Resisting has an end! I'm a loser, that's all. Oh! It's Tetsu! Who? Tetsu. He's my friend. Hey Tetsu, come here! Densuke, where you going? Granny's. I want to go too! Really? Yeah, I'll go. Okay, let's go! Resist! Yeah! Wait! What are you up to? Tetsu? What's so funny? Okay, get in. Tetsu, he's Ito. Amazing guy. A great fighter and he can break into cars. And good at peeing outdoors. I'm not so great. He is Tetsu. Hello. Hi there. You're returning from school, won't your family worry? No. They may think a bad guy kidnapped you. No problem. Why? Because his Dad has a pistol. You're Dad, too? Actually, Tetsu's Dad is an Inspector. Policeman! Bam, bam, bam! A policeman? His Dad? Inspector Kurosaki! He is? Amazing! I am so amazing! Poo! Poop! Just a moment... this one! He looks good here. I'll borrow this one. Okay. Detective! Hideyoshi had some bad luck, but he's a good guy. What happened? Tell me. They'll commend us! Pay raise! This idiot kidnapped Shinomiya's son! Kidnapped? No way... If so, we have to find him before they do. Let's go! Cherry blossoms! Come on! Let's go see. Be careful! Come on. Mister, not coming down? Dried up river below. Let's play! You go ahead. Okay! Mister! Mister Ito! I can throw farther. Stupid! Cell Phone Power Off Hey Mister, take our photo! You don't have a camera. The cell phone has one. That's true... Come on, hurry up, a photo! Hey Tetsu, pose for a photo! Mister! One more photo. One more, one more! Mom. Quick! Hold on. Kin, Taka, come here. Hello? Receiving Signal Hello, Densuke? This is Fujimoto of KO Prep School. Go. Isn't that Densuke? Yes. What is it? Sorry to trouble you, is that his father? Yes, it is. Well, is Densuke... alright? I was concerned he might be ill. He's fine. Let's go! Okay? Go! Did it! Where is Densuke now? We're hiking today. He's playing catch. You're a great father. No, teaching baseball is the least a father can do. I'm relieved to hear that. By the way, sir... To be honest, Densuke... is falling behind the other students at school. He can barely read characters, only Level 2 in multiplication. Forget reading and math. Such things are not important. What does matter is... well... to put it simply... Did you know he can pee outdoors? No. He does it great on his own. And a great shake after. His drawing has improved. He took in everything I said, and simply understood. Innocently, earnestly. In the end, it's not easy to express, but those are the important things. Even though not useful, and not profitable, that Densuke does that with such purity, makes me proud. Please tell this to Densuke, I'll see you tomorrow. It is definitely him. But there were two boys. Two? What were they like? One was quite respectable looking, but the other wore a Tigers cap, and seemed mischievous. Tigers? That's a smart boy! He was a bit ugly. Ugly? Oh yeah, the boy in the Tigers cap, seemed to be called Tetsu... Tetsu? Tigers cap... Kurosaki... Thanks. Get a task force! That'll take time. Back to headquarters. That's a waste of time! Out of my way! Get out the red light! Right. Hey, get the ball for us. Alright. Quickly! It'll drift away! It'll drift! That's great! Great! Great. Good, you got it! Thanks. Oh, it's Cherry! Cherry! Hey, son! Been a while! We meet at last. I'm glad. Dad? You go over there. Don't get mad at Mister, it's my fault. Mister Ito... Mister Kazushi Ito took me on a trip. Ito? Right, Mister Ito. He treated me to a box lunch and sushi. He played catch with me and took me to see trains. It's all true. Really! Alright, I understand. I'm not mad at all. No, I just wanted to thank him for looking after you. So head over there. Alright, I see. So go play over there. Okay. Poop! Let's go, yeah. Boss? Get to work! Dig deeper! It's getting dark! Dig faster! Cherry! Hey! Who are you?! Move! Excuse me. Stop! What's up? Cherry blossom viewing? Kurosaki, what about you? I'm searching for a kidnapper. By the way, what's he doing? Digging a garbage pit for our party. Impressive! You're done for! Kidnapper! So I have no choice but... to take him. We're not joking! Please take him. Kuribayashi... Okay, come on. Mister! Densuke. Oh yeah, better thank Densuke. He talked to Tetsu, called my house on the cell phone, and told my wife you were in trouble and needed help. You did. Right? Let's get going. Mister! Shinomiya, got any cigarettes? Densuke, come on. Here goes. Catch it with your body. That was fast. Caught it with my chest. That's it! Not bad. Too fast... Getting better! Good one! Wow, fast! You okay? Wet ball. Catch it! Shall we go now? Alright. Mister! Densuke! Dad, you lied to me. I know when you lie because your eyes flatter. "Flatter?" That's flutter, don't forget. O, que sera, sera. Densuke... I lied too. It was a lie to say my name is Kazushi Ito. My really real name is Hideyoshi Date. You shouldn't lie. Okay? Okay. Densuke, talk to everyone. Make them mad a lot, make them hug you a lot, and resist a lot. To you? No, to your Dad. Have courage, like a man. You can do it. Take a risk? And with your Mom, too. Good, that's a promise. Mister, where you going? On an adult's... risky trip. Okay, let's go. Mister! Mister Hideyoshi! I'll wait under the cherry trees. Promises are made to be kept! O, que sera, sera. A perfect day... for a new beginning. Shoot! Shoot!
