MERRY-GO-ROUND -Hello. -Hello. -Waiting for anyone? -For you. -Where are you from? -Zamora. I don't know it. Is it nice? They say it's best during Holy Week. Really? I love processions. The best is the one by the Brotherhood of the Brown Capes. I'm a Brother. -Do you parade? -Of course. -With the pointy hat? -No! I show my face. And why are you in Madrid, if I may ask? I've got some papers to sort out at the Ministry. -Will you buy me a drink? -What Will you have? -What are you having? -Whiskey. I don't like il. lt tastes like Wood. Do you mind if I have a champagne cocktail? No! Waiter, a champagne cocktail for the young lady. Right away, sir. Where are you from, what's your name? I'm from Madrid, and my name is Pola. -Very modern. -That really is my name. I was called it because my father loved the song "Amapola". Amapola... -Pretty Amapola. -It's true, you're very pretty. -Thank you. My name is really Maria Pola. Well, Maria Paula, because you can't call someone Pola. And you? -Here you are, miss. -Thank you. -What's your name? -Pepe. Like everyone. To you, Pepe, -And good luck with the papers. -I certainly need it. -Want to dance? -No, I'm a terrible dancer. I can only manage a pasodoble. This boogy-boogy is... Come on, I'll show you. It's easy. It's like a pasodoble, but apart, and with your fingers like this. -Hold them up. -Like this? -What a lousy streak! -Tough luck. -Cut the cackle, come on, Hare. -I'm in. Cards, gentlemen. -One. -He's bluffing. -Give me two. -There you go. And two for me. Let's make it another fifty pesetas. We'll see if he's bluffing. AS I'm bluffing, we'll make it 100 pesetas. Hare, northern province of Argentina, five letters, ends in y. Juluy. My 100 and another 100. I'll match your 200 pesetas, and raise you another 200. Be careful, Fortune favors fools. So, it's 400, and another 500. I'm broke... Can I put in two tickets for the Christmas-day game and a lottery ticket? Madrid-Boldkluben Copenhagen, or whatever it's called. A big game. The tickets went like hot cakes. "Marca" says Madrid is going to sign Scarone as coach. -Can I put them in? -GO ahead. Here they are. ROW 2, seats 107 and 109. And the lottery ticket, it ends in 7. That's my 500. Let's see your cards. -Full house, kings and jacks. -Aces. -Good. -Forget that. Four eights. -You're on a roll today. -Just today? What a lucky streak! -He beat his aces. -Yeah, aces. -We keep going, right? -Shit, it's 5:30. I'm happy to keep going. -Tomorrow is a tough day. -I'm leaving. Josito is sick. What's wrong? He keeps coughing and he's got a temperature. The doctor says it's just a cold. Sure, that's all it is, don't worry. Come on. Hang on a minute, Santi. I presume it's all ready for Don Jose Pedro. Of course. Apart from the suit, the musicians and everything else is arranged. -Half and hour. -Wait a minute, Santi. Listen, Don Marcelino wants you to pass by the theater tomorrow. A minute and a half at most. Are we playing or not? Meri, 1:00 in Florida Park. I want to see you there. Thanks, Higinio. If we're not playing, I'm going to work at the church. Can you wait a minute? We're trying to work here. Tickets for "White Heat", Sunday afternoon and evening. Forty for each of you. Twenty in the stalls, twenty in the dress circle. Your forty, Valen. Yours, Santi. Your forty, Hare. And yours, Oswaldo. -And "Gone Wilh The Wind"? -Tomorrow. Try to tidy yourself up tomorrow. You know Don Jose Pedro. We could've played another half hour. -Shit, Hare's kid is sick. -That kid is always sick! An extra half hour won't kill him. He's with his mother, isn't he'? Watchman! Hey, watchman! Coming! Hurry up, it's the same story every night! I'm coming! Donia Justa says you're to make her coffee right now. Tell her I'm on my way. "If I were king, oh, my love, if I were king, I would lay such treasures at your delicate feet." Good morning. See you tomorrow. Were you taking your time today? If you'd seen the mess they left behind. -See you tomorrow. -Yes, goodbye. Good morning, Mr. Estévez. Good morning, Monte. Why are you here so early? I'm in training. Of course, I'd forgotten. I won't bother you. DANCE ACADEMY They say he's very good. From the Banesto, right? Arjona, or something like that, -Orders and Transfers. -Arjonilla. Outstanding Debts. From the Vizcaya. Listen, Mr. Estévez, you have to help me. I've got a big problem. Where are you spending Christmas Eve? In the boarding house. We're having bean stew, with all the trimmings. Salted pork, garlic sausage, bacon, blood sausage... Well, Donia Dorita is from Gijon. -And you, Don Oswaldo? -I don't know. Anselma wants us to go to her parents' house, as always, but I think I WONT go this year. Since the war ended, her father hasn't said a word. He just doesn't speak. And his wife doesn't stop, even when she's got her mouth full, so you get splattered. By the time you leave you're ready to kill yourself. Good Lord, and I loved these celebrations when I was a kid. It's true, we had a great time back then. We laughed so much. What a pity. Hey, you'll see, we'll soon be laughing again. I hope so. Happy birthday! YOU remembered! Here. You're to keep it in your office, on top of the desk, so that every time... you think of me. Another thing, Don lrineo. Remember to call me and tell me in what city you want us to have dinner tonight because, depending on the city, I'll dress up one way OI' another. YOU want fritters? Sure, you see me as I am now and you don't believe I was a child who skipped rope and had a spinning top. But it's true. And, for your information, all the men said that I was very pretty and very pleasant. But I've always thought that men are such brutes. Except one, but he didn't like me, so there you are. Donia Anunciada! Donia Anunciada! Open the door! I know you're in there! Donia Anunciada! It's so hard to live. Live, live... Carmen, bastard. Carmen, bastard. Tell me something, Romualdo. Do you understand young people today? Balbinita... I say to her: "Where's the fire?", because she races out every morning. "Love", her mother says, "sit down for a while". "Have breakfast With US." "| can't, I'm late." Al night, it's the same. She has supper, if you can call it that, because she eats like a bird and then, right away, "I'm going to bed, I'm tired." I understand that, because she's always on the go, with her job and her classes, but she was doing all that before and she was a chatterbox. She's probably in love. That's what her mother says. What are you listening to? Get a move on, go back to work. And close the door. Anyway, it seems that she's talking to a boy. But what I say is, when you're dating someone, you're happy. When someone gets a girlfriend, he's delighted, "am? All that is so long ago I can't remember. Either I'm stupid or there's something wrong with that girl. Eusebio, you may be a lot of things, including stubborn and bad tempered but you're not one bit stupid. -You have to talk to her. -Sure, if she'll let me, because I can't get a peep out of her. Blll talk to her without that grumpy look you always have. Yeah, yeah. It all has to be like those films that always end well, the ones you and Rufi like. You're wrong. What the use of being so bitter all the time? It's better to be optimistic than pessimistic, to laugh than to cry. I'm telling you. If I go round all day with a long face, Will that bring Romu back? I know. Fucking war. 23 years old, Eusebio. He was always laughing. But, here we are because we have to keep going. Come on, let's get to work. Vézquez, telephone! Line one. From Banesto, it's urgent. Someone from Clearing House, an urgent call from the Zaragozano. COMO in. -Good morning, Don lrineo. -Good morning, Montesinos. -Was my office aired? -As always, Don lrineo. The cleaners open the windows when they leave at night and I close them in the morning when I arrive. You know that. If I insist every day about airing the office, Moniesinos, it is because, as you will have observed, the cleaners smell very strongly of sweat, is that not so? What can I say, Don lrineo? I know they sweat because they work, but they do sweat. Take this away and bring me some coffee. Right away, Don lrineo. The usual transfer, Don Porfirio? Yes, to the account of Donia Rosalia Fraga in the Banco Pastor in Mondonedo. In Mondonedo. You know, my mother-in-law was from Galicia, from Rébade, -near Lugo. -And...? Nothing, just that. It's a lovely part, very green. It used to be. It used to be lovely. It used to be green. It used to be the way it should. I'm from La Carolina, in the province of Jaen. It's not because it's my town but there's nowhere cleaner. And it's got the straightest streets in Spain. Or so they say, I haven't travelled. Carlos Ill built it. That's why I always thought it should be called El Carolino. I think that's nonsense, but... Here. I'm very keen for you to smoke this cigar to my health on Christmas EVE. Thank you very much, Don Porfirio, and happy Christmas. Likewise. -Good morning, Donia Anunciada. -Good morning, Vézquez. I've brought you 37 pesetas and 60 GEMS. I've counted it all. Change as much as you can into new notes. Where did you get so much small change? "By little and little the bird makes his nest". -What's that on your face? -It's just a cold sore. Be 08TH“. I knew a bank clerk who spent all day working with coins and touching his face, and he got covered in cold sores. The verdigris. Nothing happened him, but he had three children and all Of them drooled the whole time. You've ruined my morning. Well, that's how it is. -Yes? -Donia Dorita, it's Higinio. What is it? Would you let me make a phone call? -All right, but be quick. -Yes, yes. Thank you, Donia Dorita. -Morning, Petri. -Morning, Mr. Higinio. Hotel Palace? Good morning. I'd like to speak to Mr. Jose Pedro Cervantes. Don Jose Pedro, you have a phone call in the hall. Very well. Get me an appointment with the barber for a shave and haircut. And a manicure, to see if we can fix this. -Here. -Thank you. -I'll be right back, Manolo. -Yes, sir. Hello? Yes, speaking. Hello, Higinio. No! like that. AS a bullfighter. Very well. I'll see you here at 11 :00. Goodbye. Hare, as a bullfighter. Listen, how's your son? Well, don't worry. Listen, listen... Listen, dammit. Drop by Chicote's Bar at about 1:00 and ask for Fermin. Tell him you're a friend of mine. He'll arrange the penicillin for you in no lime. If he asks you about money, which he won't, tell him I'll square it with him. All right. Don't worry, once he gets the injection he'll be jumping around in a couple of days. Don't mention it, Hare. See you later. That's two calls! Shit. How was it? Fine. Your father rang me last night at the club. The lawyer {Old him they haven't pardoned your brother. He might be executed next month. Fuck. It's not definite, but it's possible. Yeah. He wants you to go see him at work tonight, to talk about it. I can't go tonight. I could go, before I go to the "Pasapoga" Club. -You know where it is? -Yes, where they're building houses at La Cruz de los Caidos, near the CEA studios. He'll be there around 12:00. No, earlier. He said they've fired the other watchman. He'd stolen a load of bricks and until they replace him your father is on double shifts. Move over. Listen, if you do go, take a taxi. And don't wear your work shoes, they'll get covered in plaster and mud. That place is a mess. What do I tell him? Tell him that I'll take care Of it. The world was and will be rubbish, I know, in the year 510 and in the year 3000 too. Did they bring the egg? YES. Hugo, did they bring the egg? I said, yes! Do you think that guy will get the money? Banks are the same the world over, like the military. Penna, don't get on your soapbox. Put the egg in your hair and rinse it well so it doesn't affect your brain. Then, just smile and let me do the talking. You know, the star, the best, the most glamorous, the most marvellous, the most charming, but not a word. I know what you're like. WNW.! WNW.! -Yes, Don César? -Get a taxi and, first of all, take this envelope to "Arriba". In the same taxi, take this one to "ABC". On the way back, stop at the Madrid Casino and ask Julia, the cigarette girl, for Don César's filter tips. Pay her and come back here. Take 100 pesetas. -We'll sort it out later. -Very well, Don César. Whatever they say, with every year that passes Madrid is becoming more European. And more uncomfortable. Nothing is close anymore. It's never been better than it is now, Don Luis. Madrid is dynamic, European. Madrid is fast-paced. It's starting to grow upwards, like New York, like it has to be. But we're losing the essence. What ESSENCE? What ESSENCE? Was Madrid better when it smelled of "chotis" and doughnuts? For heaven's sake! In my opinion, the Old traditions of Madrid weren't bad at all. But of course I'm from Madrid while you, Don Ramén, -are from Teruel -I've lived n Madrid since I was thirteen. That's what's good about Madrid. It accepts dual nationality. You say we're getting like New York. But I say we're getting more like Caracas. Take a walk around the area of Nuevos Ministerios. Caracas . Madrid is Caracas. And then... Well, of course. To know if it's a mechanical or an electrical failure, tell me first if you heard... of... Mechanics has a mystery of its own. Now, if the noise before it stalls is not... but more like... it could be the carburettor. But if it's... that's the coil. It's the carburation. The carburation is bad. The Dodge leaves the factory with a good carburettor, but it's delicate, nothing like the one in the Cadillac, of the Chevrolet or the Sunbeam. When it's been rewed up too much, and that's what you've done, you have to get it checked right away. We'll send the tow truck immediately. And another thing. You can be sure that this is going to cost you quite a bit. Well, I'd say it'll be at least... 1,000 pesetas. YES. Now, tell me the street and the number where the car is. Kid, write this down. Donoso Cortés, number 14. Don't worry, the tow truck will pick up the Dodge in two ticks. Don't mention it, really. Goodbye. -Shit! -Just what I thought. It's obvious. After the... it could only be the carburation. Yeah, but at the start he was saying... -It had to be the coil. -No. -No, Mr. Romualdo... -The carburation. The coil would have gone... It had to be the carburation. The wing nut must have broken so he's got problems with the mixture flow. Yes, indeed! Well done, kid! Knife grinder! I'll sharpen your knives, scissors, blades! Knife grinder! Thanks. -Hello. -How are you? Are you coming to the house for Christmas? My parents are so keen to meet you. I can't. I'm going on a trip now, to La Rioja, Aro, Calahorra, and then Palencia, Aguilar de Campoo. This is our busiest time of the year. But when I come back, it's a date. When Will that be? The 3rd or the 4th. For the Epiphany. Do you love me, Honorio? Of course I love you. Really? Really. It's just... You know, I've always had a glass of milk in the morning. Now, just seeing it, so white, makes me retch. My mother insists that I drink it every morning. "It's full Of calcium". She keeps on about it. If you knew what it's like trying to pour it down the toilet without her finding out. You're not...? It's just come on. But what's wrong with you? I don't know. I think it's nerves. I've got a premonition, a bad one. I'll write as soon as I arrive. Thanks. The thing is, I'm getting married on the 28th, at noon. We're having the reception in the El Bosque Banqueting Hall, in Almansa Street, near the Metropolitan Stadium where Atleti play. And I have to open the dancing. I've been refusing, but my fiancée and her family are insisting. Apparently, when one of them gets married, it's a tradition that the couple open the dancing -With that waltz Of the bat. -Die Fledermaus. Yes, that one. And I... I've never danced in my life. Out of shyness, I guess. But I do like dancing. The other time I got married... This is my second wedding. My first wife, Antoniita, died four years ago. She choked, on a fishbone. Horrible. Al the first wedding, in 1941, there was no dancing. We didn't celebrate it. Antonita's family was still in mourning for her brother who was killed at the battle of the Ebro. So I didn't have to dance. Do you think that with three or four classes, there isn't time for any more, I could learn? I'm warning you, Delia, I'm very, very clumsy. I can't ride a bicycle or swim or whistle. Of course, Mr. Poyatos. There's another problem. I work in the Boca, near here, in Jose Antonio Avenue, in Current Accounts, and I leave, at the earliest, around 7:30 or 8:00. And all my time is taken up with the wedding. In order to come here now, I had to take half an hour Off. But I said I was going to the doctor, because I wasn't going to say to my boss: "Don lrineo, I'm going dancing". My dear Mr. Poyatos, don't worry. No matter when you come, I guarantee that on the 28th, when you take your wife out to dance the Die Fledermaus waltz, your friends, your relatives, everyone, will be amazed at how well you doll. God willing, because I'm haunted by the thought that I'm going to stand on Maribel's dress, or on her, which is even worse. You see that gentleman? -Which one? -The smaller. The other is Jacobo, my brother, the teacher. Brother on my father's side. That gentleman has only had three days of classes. Trust me, Mr. Poyatos. Shit, three days? He dances better than Fred Astaire and Niiinsky together. Your papers, please. Are you the police? The BOOK. Come with us. Where? Where do you think? I've done nothing. I warn you, if you resist you'll make it worse. I'd just like to know what I'm accused of. They'll tell you there. Let's go. I live at 6, Apodaca Street, in the attic. I've got a dog called Cocktail. If you could do something for him... The janitor, Carmen, will let you in. You mean the janitress. No, the janitor. HE'S called Carmen . I heard you say one day that you liked dogs. Let's go. Thank you. Madrid isn't Madrid anymore, or New York, OI' Caracas. Madrid is Moscow. -Where are you going? -To our room. Perlita, come here, don't be nervous. He'll be here any minute. What do I tell him if you're not here? It's rude. It's rude to keep us waiting for an hour. You know what to tell him? Tell him go to hell. He can take his contract, roll it up and stick it up his fat ass. -Perlita, come on. -Stop calling me Perlita. Perlita! Hugo! Forgive me! Forgive me! I'm sorry. The Dodge broke down just when I was coming here and it left me stranded. It went... and that was it. Don't you think it's funny? -Good morning, Fulgencio. -Hello, Donia Anunciada. Not again! Allow me. There's some joker, not to call him something worse, who keeps pouring ink in the holy water font. And there's no way we can catch that "pain in the ass". -I'm sorry, but it's driving me crazy. -That's all you needed. And are you still suffering martyrdom with your bunions? It's terrible, Donia Anunciada. As bad as the collection from the faithful. It's clear that in this world there is less devotion every day. Everyone and his brother has become... -You know. -Communist. Capitalist, which is worse. They hang on tight to their pesetas and won't let go of them. No one wants to contribute to the Church. Let's see what capital you've brought us today. We need fewer faces of Franco and more notes. It must be the will Of Divine Providence. It's very little. Don Natalio, who is a saint, always says that what matters isn't the pesetas but the intention of the giver. Here you are, and keep trying, Donia Anunciada. Keep trying- Encourage the parishioners to be more generous when they're making their contribution. Remind them that they gain indulgences. I do remind them, Fulgencio, but they don't care. Don't you see that Spain is becoming atheist? Something has to be done or three quarters of Madrid's population will go straight lo hell. As for me... I'm from Astorga. Those wonderful biscuits! -Goodbye, Fulgencio. -Goodbye, Donia Anunciada. A pittance. A lousy... Thank you, Mr. Méndez. I'll see you this evening. And... Higinio told me you could help me with penicillin. My son has had a very high temperature for four days and he keeps coughing. Well, he'll see us in the bank this afternoon. So all this business of the Spanish cinema being in crisis again with less films being made than before is not true? Of course not, my dear Hugo. Our cinema isn't in crisis again for the simple reason that it's always in crisis. How funny! Don Acisclo, the mayor of Cogolledo de la Sierra, my town, is married to my cousin Laurita and they have a boy who is about eight years old, and he's called Acisclo too. -Acisclito. -Let him go on. Well... Poyaios, in Current Accounts, is getting married. -Again? -It's only the second time. -Are you putting in anything? -I'd love to be a widower. Put me down for 50 pesetas. Povedano, 50. Put me down for another 50. No, no. 40. Ansorena, 40. -What about you? -Hang on. Lecifiana, Colmeiro, Berberana... Poyatos! Here he is. 30 pesetas. 30 pesetas. The same as he gave when I got married. Estévez, 30 pesetas. Tell me one day how you got hold of your wedding list. Rueda, have you heard anything about an extra payment, -as well as the bonus? -No. I wish I had. Go on. Anyway, the boy got very sick, double or triple pneumonia, and the doctor said he wouldn't pull through. The doctor in your town, Cogolludo de la Sierra. No, Cogolledo. The doctor said he was dying. Laurita asked me to send her a picture of the Holy Jesus, and I did. They put the picture on the boy's bedside table and lit a candle beside it, and I'm so unlucky that the boy went and got better. As they'd promised that if Jesus worked a miracle they'd come to Madrid to give thanks and kiss his feet and leave a donation, the three are coming. I don't get it. What do you care if the mayor of Cogollete de la Sierra comes? Cogolledo, Cogolledo de la Sierra. All right, whatever, HO matter. What do you care if the mayor, your cousin Laurita and the kid come to see the Holy Jesus? I don't care if they come to see Jesus or the Blessed Virgin. But they're coming to see me at the bank. And? Shit, "And?". I told them, and the whole town, that I'm the director of the bank, not the porter. Samueye, my friend, when I tell your bankers at... Boca? -Yes, Boca. B-O-C-A. Banco Occidental de Credito y Ahorro. Boca. When I tell your bankers at Boca how I see the film, the crisis is over for you. They'll recommend the immediate authorization of the loan. I love hearing you talk. "Your bankers". So delightful, so strong. "When I tell your bankers..." That is thinking big. It's great, so different from here. And now, if you agree, I've rented a large car to go to Segovia, to visit the aqueduct, the cathedral and eat suckling pig at Casa Céndido. How lovely! As, 12, 12. Yes, I'll give Mr. Porrifios the message when he arrives. Thank you. You're welcome. Goodbye. -Who was it? -From Cifesa Films for Mr. Porrinos. Do you want the glass of Benedictine now? No, later. Finish the rooms or you'll be at it all day! There's a lot of scheming in the film world. Without a recommendation, forget it. It's always the same actors. Nowadays, either you have lots of curly hair, broad shoulders and look like a lamb going to the slaughter, or you can forget it. Because what's here doesn't matter. They're dubbed... You've seen Antonio Vilar. He speaks like this. "The love I feel for you, my lady, is even greater than your beauty". But as he's dubbed, and people don't know... Olives like in the old days, Paco. These ones may be stuffed with anchovies but they've got no taste. "Stuffed" is saying a lot. Have you seen what's inside these olives? It's very odd, like a little worm. Anyway... I hope you win. That's more difficult. The fortune teller in N° 15 said it would end in 9 this year. No one you know ever wins the lottery. It's always someone from Bilbao or Albacete. And they keep it quiet. Dear Rosalia, You can't imagine how much I miss you. Every night, at our time, When I start to caress and bite your little cinnamon colored nipples, I repeat what I said to myself as a child. Life is a scam, a real swindle. We just made your transfer and like every year at this time, I'm also sending you a ticket for the big lottery. Maybe we'll win. Let's be honest. With money, everything is better, everything becomes simpler. -Hello, Vicente. -Hello, Hare. I've come to see Don Marcelino. Governed, corrected by control, nine letters. Regulated. One minute, one minute and a half, for the end of the first act. I thought it could be set in France, to avoid problems. A couple are in bed. He says to her: "Veronique, have you ever been unfaithful?" She says: "Jean Pierre, how can you ask that after all these years?" "I need to know." And she says: "Jean Pierre, my love, three times." "Three times?" "Yes, but I always did it for you, my love." "The first time?" "That was when we built the HOUSE and we were very short of money. You were so keen that I... Well, with the contractor..." "And the second?" "That was for you too, love. Remember when you wanted to do the garden, we were short of money? You were so keen that I thought I'd do it with the bank manager, and I did." "And the third?" "The third, my love, was for you too. Remember when you ran for mayor and were short of 73 votes?" That's it. Here. 200 pesetas. If it gets past the censor, I'll give you another 200 next Friday. Thank you, Don Marcelino. Send the girls in. Yes, sir. Girls, Don Marcelino wants you. You're very pretty. But they'll ban even the dress rehearsal. Let's see. Put On the hats. Take them Off. Tell Ricky we're starting the rehearsal in five minutes. Katia, wait a minute. -Don't! -What's wrong? -Last night? -Last night, last night... I had to go home. I told you it was lnmaculada's birthday and I was dining with all the relatives. But tonight... Tonight I'm free. Don't! As soon as the show is over, I've got the Moet, and the hors d'oeuvres from Lhardy that you love. -Well, I can't tonight. -Why not? Shit, why not? There's a birthday party. Whose birthday? - I can't remember. -Come here. Hey! You haven't forgotten the meat rolls. No, neither the meat rolls. Nor the gelatine for your thighs and all the rest. Fm not defending scripts with the classic Aristotelian structure, presentation, development and outcome, much less now, with all the neo-realism. But, believe me, all the sub-plots mean that the main story loses interest. -We, however... -Samueye, please, let the gentleman express himself. Thank you. This, the script, is your best guarantee, because written herein, and never better said, is the success or failure of your venture. For me, a good script is the one that comes with a solid guarantee. The boca can't take a risk if the script is not solid. And at this moment, it's not. But it could be. We're listening. -Can we speak truthfully? -We'd like nothing better. Your Hollywood films are as good and as well made as the ones you made in Argentina or Mexico. "Bloody Pampa", "The Bride's Tresses", "The Local Store" or "Vile Redemption", in which you, Perla, were sublime. Thank you. As that woman condemned to death and in love with Arturo de Cordoba, the insane prison governor. Where is the failing in "Empty Streets" or "Terror in Madison Square Gardens", with Macdonald Carey? In the scripts. I'm a great admirer of yours, Mr. de los Rios. Hugo. Thank you. I would like your first film among us, Hugo, to be a great success. But the character Of Gerardo Durén and above all his socio-professional condition isn't authentic. Not to mention the title. "Red Sky". -Do you really think... -Let him speak, please. I'm sorry to interrupt you, Don lrineo. What is it? Mr. Poyatos wants to speak to you, it's urgent. Send him in. Excuse me, Don lrineo, I have to go to the doctor. -Yes, of course, go on. -Thank you. You're going to shoot a film in present-day Spain, the modern Spain Of the start Of the second half of the 20th century. But don't be mistaken. In Spain today, it's impossible that a priest, whatever crisis of faith he may have, should fall in love with a woman and have an affair with her. And with a man? Perla, that's enough, please. What are you saying, my dear Méndez? Are the priests here not men? What have they got in their veins? Holy water? My admirable Perla, personally I believe that you, and I say this in front of your husband with the greatest respect, could enamour any man, even Cardinal Segura himself. Thank you. But you know what they say, and it's true. They say we are the spiritual reserve of the West. -They say... - They say of me... They say that Pm ugly and going to ruin, that Pm bow-legged and step it out. -Where is the toilette? -on, yes! BIND'. Across the hall. She's marvellous. She's a star. Now, as I was saying... If, instead of Gerardo Duran dying alone, she were to die in the fire too, that's a different matter. My dear Méndez... ""160. Thank you. My dear lrineo, with the same sincerity, I have never met, not just a banker, but a critic, producer or scriptwriter with a greater sense of cinema than you have. So I ask you... If we change the title, get rid of "Red Sky" and put -"Red Sin"... -But, what...? We modify the structure, we forget about the sub-plot and, in the final scene, Gerardo and Alarica, enveloped in flames and clinging to each other, die together, which as an ending is much more... If we change all that, Will Boca go ahead with the film? If they both die enveloped in flames, in punishment for their red sin... Red Sin, Scarlet Sin, whatever. If they die» but not clinging to each other, the Boca will go ahead with the film. It's incredible! Why aren't you writing for the cinema, lrineo? You want the truth, Hugo? I don't have time. If you work in a bank in a position of responsibility, you don't have time for anything else. And I work. But the truth is I love cinema with a passion. I should have been a director, of films, I mean, not of a bank. One last suggestion, Hugo. Basilio. -Basilio? -Yes, Basilio. Fernén-Gémez would do it much better than Fernando Rey. COMO in. Toast with butter and jam. A large coffee with three sugars for the prettiest box office clerk in Spain, France or Hollywood. Stop talking such rubbish. Well... The tickets for Christmas Day. 80 stalls and 80 circle. Total, 160. Count them! I don't need to. -You know what we have to do? -Get married. Don't say it like that. I'm serious. Get married. And set up a ticket sales business With 20%. It's legal and it makes money. We'd have the best seats for the cinema, the theater, soccer, bullfights, boxing, everything. You and me together, you out front and me on the telephone. -We'd make a fortune. -Yeah. -Can I have two seats for tonight? -They're in the front row. -And upstairs? -Just the front row. Thank you. And no shady dealing, know what I mean? You're saying that because you know I'm married. -Otherwise... -Get unmarried. You look after Pola, she's the best girl around. How is she? Fine, you know. Give her my regards. Being a scalper is all right when you're in your twenties, like I was after my army service. But you get tired of being arrested every other day. Well, looking for an office and selling seat tickets isn't a bad idea. Golidia is doing great. And as for getting unmarried, we'll talk another day. What's wrong? Again? I don't know what to do. -He gives me his word. -Son of a bitch. But after three days, he starts again. Last night I said to him: "The next time, I'll take the child and leave... Carmencita notices everything now, she's getting scared of her father. Two for the dress circle, please. I just have the front row of the stalls. You should see him when he's drunk. He's a different person. They say man is the only animal to make the same mistake twice. It's not true, Higinio. Women do it at least three times. Anyway, you know... Come on, Teresita, don't get upset. And eat up, your coffee's getting cold. I'll come and get it later. ...stragglers from both armies. The last they'll do is take your horse... Where can we find a place around here that we can afford? Save up, and I'll keep my ears open. Now you shall go home. Anyone who did what you've done today can take care of Sherman. Come along, Scarlett, stop crying. Blow your nose like a good little girl. The Ibiza. "The Diary of a Chambermaid", with Paulette Goddard and "The Drums of Fu Manchu" You could splash out and take me to "Gone With The Wind". It's always full. I hear Clark Gable is... Remember him in "China Seas", when they tortured him With the Malay boot? The Narvéez. "Down Argentine Way", wonderful Technicolor, and "Notorious", with Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman. -Someone's ringing. -That one. That one, Eusebio. -Good evening. Donia Anunciada. -Hello, Donia Rufi. A body gets out of breath on the stairs. Come in, come in. Sit down and have a rest. -Just for a minute. -Hello. Would you like a drink? You know I never drink, but thank you. -How are we doing? -Just as you'd expect. Getting worse every day. I don't know why everyone wants to grow old. I just don't know. That Virgin is Portuguese too, isn't she? Yes, indeed. Nueskra Sahara as Desconsmados. "Os" Desconsolados. Yes. What does that matter? It matters a lot, Anunciada, because it's the second Portuguese virgin you've brought in here. The first one was last year when you brought the "Virgen dos Oyos Grandee". WhiCh means the Virgin of the Big Eyes and how Nuestra Senora Os Descosolados. What's going on? Are there no Spanish Virgins? What about the Virgen del Pilar, the Macarena, the Moreneta? And the Virgen de la Paloma and the Virgen de Puy de Estella, which happens to be mine! Where are they? Don't you work with them? Well, take note of this. As this is a Portuguese virgin, the people who have to give offerings are the Portuguese, not the Spaniards. That's for sure. So you can tell the people in your parish church on behalf of Eusebio Cascajero y Esparza that if they want offerings they should bring Spanish virgins. And while you're at it, tell your friends in black, also on behalf of Eusebio Cascajero y Esparza, that Fatima is a big lie. Yes, yes, I heard it On Radio Independent Spain, short wave. A little plane was flying around and when people saw the sunlight reflected on its wings they thought it was the sun that was dancing, and the Portuguese were spellbound. But, no! A little plane, that's all. -Are you still making paper roses? -What a life! It's better than slaving away on the Singer. Have you left Bilbao for good? I've been a pen pusher at RENFE for two years, and writing whenever I can. By the wav, tonight I'm reciting here in "Early Morning Verses", with Manuel Alcéntara, a young poet from Malaga. He's very good. I'm telling you because I'd be so happy if you came. Tonight? I don't lhink I can. On the 3rd, I'm giving a recital in the Segovian Center. You never stop. And next Wednesday, the 2am, I've got a wedding. A second cousin of mine, Maribel, is getting married, to a widower. They're having a big celebration. Look, I've just received the menu with the invitation. If you want to come with me... "Ham rolls, consommé with egg yolk and a dash of sherry, bream, chicken..." Chicken garnished with vegetables and French fries. Naturally, white and red wine, liqueurs, cake... -I don't know what to say. -Champagne... Claridad Publishers, Argentina, published in 1944 and possibly out of print. -If it's not, shall I order it? -Yes, please. It'll take a while. I have to write to the publisher. It's in Buenos Aires, 1621-1645 San José Street. -Shit, what a memory! -Not one paper. It's all here. -And "Fiesta"? -Diana, Mexico. I think it was published 18 months ago, but it sold very well. You're referring to what is called in English "The SUI'! Also Rises". Yes, that's it. See if it's available. I've taken note. I nearly forgot, another "Canto General", by Neruda. So, one Amer“, mo max Mm and two “Qankos Genemes“ . Will it be very swanky? I need to know what to wear. You always look wonderful. I'd be there as your... what? As you wish. Well, as a friend. That explains this date. No, it's got nothing to do with that! I'll explain. There's a literary contest in Catalonian, in Brazil, in Sao Paulo. Poetry Festival of the Catalonian Language in Exile. The Xandri Award, with an X. This is the cutting. My brother sent it to me. You know he had to get out of here fast and go over there. “'5 true. "Xandri Award. Poetry Festival of the Catalonian Language in Exile." I'm going to take part. It'll be hard, because all of America will be competing, but I've got nothing to lose. Twelve sonnets. I still don't know if they'll be about the sea, about love... I'll write them in the language of the Empire and you put them into Catalonian. The prize is 2,000 cruceiros. If I win, you get 200. Do them about the sea, the love thing is old hat now. An allegory between (be sea and liberty would be good, don'! you mink? -What? -I'm sorry. You should do them about the sea, the love thing is old hat. Something like Valéry's "The Graveyard by the Sea". An allegory between the sea and freedom would be good. Terrific. That's it. So, if we win, 1,000 cruceiros for you, and 1,000 for me. Agreed? Agreed. Are you all right, champ? Troncoso told me that Arionilla took the adding machine home every night, to do finger and handle work, and the bets are 4-1 in his favor. This isn't the time to tell Estévez that. It is, because he thrives On difficulties, right, Estevita? I'm a friend of numbers, and numbers are my friends. What? I'm a friend of numbers, and numbers are my friends. And prime numbers? The most important of all! -Ansorena -What? Povedano... This is no time for jokes. -So you're not staying, Don lrineo? -I can't, I've got an engagement. But take this... and, in my name, bet 10 pesetas on Estévez and... another ten on Arionilla. I'm putting a few pesetas on Estévez. -Don't forget to open the windows. -Don't worry, Don lrineo. Windows... Ready. Eyes ahead. Little fingers in position. And... "Obeying a decree of unprecedented depravity comma Christ was despoiled comma unmitigatedly comma of His woven garment by coarse, criminal henchmen to be flagellated or fustigated cruelly with barbaric whips comma and comma in their uncivilized way comma with extreme irony and cruelty comma they crowned him with thorns full stop... You may remove your masks and sign the exercise. YOU have a five-minute break. Balbina, will you come to my office? Thank you. The thing is, Balbina, over the last few days you've shown a lack of interest. Your work is getting worse. You've gone from 315 keystrokes to 170. I'm afraid that if you go on like this your chances of getting the position in the Inland Revenue are minimal. Is anything wrong? Do you have a problem? No. I don't know. -I am interested. -But not as you were before. And it's a pity. You have a gift for typing. Your hands are special. If you want, I can give you private classes. -It's... -No, don't worry about the money. When you get the post, we'll sort that out. Well, the thing is, I work and I don't have much time for some classes. As well as preparing for the state exam, I'm finishing Commerce. Balbina, when one wants, there's time for everything. All my hours in the day are filled, from 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. But if both of us are interested... What time do you start work? Some days at 7:00 a.m., others at 3:00 p.m. It depends. I'm a ticket clerk in the Subway, in the Retiro Station. What a coincidence. I live close by, in Jorge Juan. Well, the days you start at mo, come at 6:00, and when it's an afternoon shift, come at 2:00. That's when we stop for lunch. Well... Did you break a nail? No, it's nothing. Does it hurt'? A bit. Balbina, it's a pity. With these pianist's hands, you could win the Miss Underwood contest in Chicago. DOGS that contest exist? No. The war in Korea, however distant and exotic it may seem to us, has done no more than give further credit to Franco. What would have become of the West, of Europe, of the World, dammit, without our Crusade? Fourteen years before, fourteen years, which is nothing, right? Well, fourteen years before the world realized what the communists were really like, it was our breasts and our arms that were breaking lances in defence of the Faith and of the civilization that was under threat. Is that not so? That's why it isn't strange that Franco is the person most admired by President Truman. Believe me. Truman doesn't make a single move without phoning Franco beforehand. And then they say that Franco is this or Franco is that. General, when you're ready... Good evening. Follow me, please. This way. The people who go to the terraces in summer are not café people. People who go to terraces are amateurs, they're not like us. They drink beer and "horchata". Believe me, I've never sat on a terrace. It's horrific. I don't know how they stand it. Harassed at all hours by beggars, by tie salesmen who are even worse, by photographers, by candy sellers. And what about the pests who sell those wind-up toys? And the ones selling lighter flints? Hush! Terrace-goers have got nothing to do with cafés. They go to the terraces because they can't go to the spas. But, really, can you imagine... I don't know, Don José Ortega y Gasset out on the street, in full view of everyone, besieged by those people who sell liquids for removing stains? What's more, it's a lie, because they don't work. The cafe is the cafe and the terrace is the terrace. Paco, another jug of water, please. -Don Antonio Miguel! -Hello, Julia. -It's lovely to see you. -How are you? When I come here, I always feel I'm in a dentist's waiting room. It was my father's surgery. He was an urologist. For you, and happy Christmas. Good lord, Don Antonio Miguel, why on earth did you bother? -Sit down, please. -After you. Thank you. I know you like these chocolates liqueurs. And I promised you those stockings, for the prettiest legs in the Salamanca district. -Clippers! -Clippers? The everlasting stocking. Well, how is business? Just so-so. This year, just so-so. Why is that? It's simply because less people are dying. -You don't say. -Better food, better hygiene. It's not like the Forties. And the price of good wood is sky high. You wouldn't believe the price of a coffin that's merely decent, with no decoration. Well, Don Antonio Miguel, don't get annoyed with me, but I've made my mind up, quite firmly. I don't want any pine box. They can burn me. That's another thing. There are more cremations. It's more modern, it's cleaner, there are no bones or skulls. What's more, I've heard they put your ashes in a little porcelain jar and give it to your family. You must admit that it's quite different. But to think that one will be reduced to a simple jar of dust left on top of a sideboard is not very... Don Antonio Miguel, the lady from Cordoba says that when you're ready... -You know, the usual place. -Thank you, Angustias. Dust. IS dust worth the trouble? It's up to you, Julia. DONG! DONG! Arionilla, two minutes, two seconds. Estévez, two minutes, four seconds. Partial winner on times, Arionilla. Gentlemen! We'll now move on to the totals. Arionilla, 112 million, 970 thousand, see, and 22 GEMS. Estévez, 112 million, 970 thousand, see, and 22 GEMS. There is a mistake, a difference of 27 pesetas. He's screwed up. The tens are inverted. A mistake in the 28th number by Arionilla. The correct total is Estévez's and he has WON the contest! Estévez! Estévez! Arionilla, you're phenomenal, congratulations. I want to take this opportunity to tell you that if we exercised our brains more we'd halt the invasion by machines. If we don't do it, my friends, the day will soon come when all of us will end up as their slaves. Shit! Estévez knows it all! With a one and a two and a one, two, three! Estévez, Estévez... After class, I took a walk around the Plaza Mayor and looked at the stalls selling Nativity scenes. -On your own'? -No, with Pili. What were the Nativity scenes like? What do you think? The Holy Family, with the donkey, the straw, the shepherds... Eat up, love, your soup will get cold. And it's your favorite. What was Pili saying? How's her mother? She's better. Pili hasn't been here in a while. YES. Listen, Balbina, I was thinking that, now that it's Christmas, why don't you ask your boyfriend to have a drink here, in OUT home? Well, I wouldn't exactly call him my boyfriend. No? Well, your... Your suitor. -He's not that either. -Then what are you? Well, we're friends. Friends. Tell me, that ring... Did your friend give you that? YES. LETS have a |00|(. -May I see it? -Yes. -It's lovely. -I'll say. Is it gold? Yeah, in a pig's ass. Don't say that. Give it to me! Let's see. Look, it says here "GIG". What (1065 it mean? German GUN. Even if you are just friends, ask him home. We'd just like to meet him, nothing more than that. -What's his name? -Honorio. He's going to be away at Christmas, working. But he'll be back at New Year, before the 6th. Your mother says that HE'S a commercial "WHEY. Yes, that's the problem. Why? Because he's always moving around. -Oh, of course. -He doesn't have a steady job. Now he's going to La Rioja, Ezcaray, Aro, and then Palencia. This is the busiest time for biscuit orders. RED SIN Oh, my God! Happy birthday, my dear Mr. lrineo. -Are the children sleeping? -Of course, Mr. lrineo. Out cold. -Are you sure? -Of course, Mr. lrineo. Absolutely. Would Mr. lrineo like me to pour him a glass of champagne? Yes, of course. But first, would you like to do a little tasting? I appreciate it. I don't like having to tell you to pay, especially at a time like this, but, apart from this month, you also owe October and November, and the landlord complains to me, and I'm just the janitor. Before Christmas Eve, I'll pay for October, and at the end of the year, November. And tell Don Porfirio from me that I always pay, late, but I pay. God will punish him for being so uncharitable to a poor old woman with no one to defend her. LOOK, take this. It's a holy picture of Our Lady of the Unconsoled, so that she'll grant you health. You're coughing a lot recently, Carmen. Take my advice, put a hot poultice on your chest. TO hell with the holy picture. Give it to someone else. I don't believe in those things. And I don't know why you say I'm coughing a lot. I had a cold and now I'm fine. Damned if I'll use a poultice. Anyway... I'm sorry to come so late but I've called on several days and either you weren't in or you wouldn't open the door. Good night. Today "Marca" said that Madrid was bringing Escarone as coach. Escarone, world champion in 1930. He took 117 penalties and put 116 in the net. The one he missed bounced off the crossbar. But being coach for Madrid is a different matter. Madrid is a difficult team for coaches. Bernabeu decides everything, even how they take corners. Hare, go get the taxis and bring them to the door. -We'll be down in ten minutes. -Very well. What a surprise, Don Jose Pedro. We weren't expecting you until the spring. I was keen to come. The money's in my coat. No, there's no hurry, maestro. It's all agreed. They'll be paid when you finish the fight. They're going to sign a receipt, so you can claim expenses. No paperwork. Leave US alone. Don Jose Pedro, this may not be the best time, but... You've got a lot of influence, you're well connected. You were at Franco's side when he took Barcelona. What is it? I've got a brother, he's older than me, a good guy, DUI HE'S a bit Of an extremist. He's been in jail for a while and WE'VE been l0Id that he may be shot next month. For being a communist. He's not a communist, he's an asshole. After the war, he got a job as a lathe operator and he was very good, but they fired him. For being a communist. I don't know. Then he went to France. I wrote to him not to come back. Give me all the details afterwards. Don Jose Pedro, I don't know how to thank you. -What are the bulls like? -The bulls? One is a marvel. The horns... Maestro, horns are horns. Bright eyed, not heavy, but very strong. We've called him "Birlaor". I like it. All the ones that end in "or" are good and charge to the right. -The second one? -The second one... He's black, but really black, like a black telephone. Powerful muscles, fearless, well-positioned horns... We haven't named him yet. "Barberito". Congratulations. You couldn't have been luckier. It's as if this were your birthday. EVEN better. It's as if you'd won the Christmas lottery. They're only going to ban your novel. That's all. You can carry on appearing on the radio and you can continue to write, under a pseudonym, your novels about cowboys, romances and monsters. And they told me clearly that no one will stop you writing another serious novel or submitting it for the "Nadal". And they're not asking that the protagonist should be a priest or a Falangist. But, neither should he be an undesirable. Let him love his country a bit, dammit, and go to mass occasionally. I mean it, Ricardo, you should be happy, because they even talked about locking you up. One of the censors, Fr. lbarra, was insisting on it. That's when I spoke up and said enough was enough, if we'd gone to war it was to defend the freedom of all. IS that not SO? I'm saying all this so you can tell Chuchi. I know your wife is saying that her fascist cousin won't do anything for the family. That's why I'm saying this is your lucky day. Go bet on the game, I'm sure you'll win. To celebrate, we'll have a glass of brandy. My treat. Paco! By the wav, a little bird told me you're learning to tango. Now, I really like the tango, especially "La Cumparsita" and "Yira". But the tango has got a bad name. A lot of people think it's obscene. Can you not try something more normal? A jota, a sevillana, a pasodoble... Something normal, dammit. Yes, indeed, it's very simple. If you've lost a leg on the nationalist side, you're a glorious mutilated gentleman. If it was torn Off on the republican side you're a lousy cripple. But, tell me, if you've lost both, like me, and each one on a different side, what are you? You're an asshole, that's what. Thank you. Good evening, Don Jose Pedro, what a night. Good evening. Jose Pedro, you've sold every seat. TO the bullfight! Hell, who taught you to drive? Sorry. Look how pretty Anunciada was. What would that idiot Carmen say if he saw this fortune? Just look, Don Porfirio! You have to save, Pipo, you have to save for tomorrow. WHO KNOWS when if" arrive'? Come on, bull. Olé! HE'S wonderful. Hook him on the snout. "The day has ended, no one interrupts the peace now. There only remains next to the anvil misery on its knees." This is dedicated to a very special person, from Barcelona. "When..." "When the faces, do you remember..." The important thing, as Estévez said, is that the mayor, your cousin and the kid arrive at the bank at 10:00 on the dot. No earlier, no later. Al 10 :00. Otherwise, we're all screwed. If you tell them exactly what I told you to tell them, there's no problem. Laurita, tell that Acisclo I can fit you in at 10:00. Before that, I've got a meeting With the Risk Committee, and at 10:30 the Management Executive. But, despite the work I've got and the fact it's Friday, I'll be delighted to see you from 10:00 to 10:30 because, cousins, the family comes first. Very good! One thing, don't say "Tell that Acisclo". Say "Tell Acisclo", and give it a bit more rhythm. LOPS see it. A bit more slowly, look the bull in the eye. Torero, get him in position. Come on. The same again. This bullfighter has got style. -Torero! -That's it, keep going. Finish it with style. Bravo, maestro! Music! Torero! You're phenomenal! Here we go. Know what I was thinking? If he finally gets the money, which I had doubted, but after meeting lrineo who's mad as a hatter, anything could happen. So, if the film goes well, we could come and live here. -In Spain? -Yeah. -What's got into you? -My mother. It would be nice to bring her home. “'5 her life's dream. And she's got relatives here. In Vigo, she's got nieces, cousins... And Madrid is pretty. I like it. It's dry. My back doesn't hurt me here. We could bring your parents too. No, not them. No one could snift them from Barrio Norte. And they're Old. But they do have relatives here. Anyway, let's wait and see. I've still got commitments with Paramount. Stop messing around with Hollywood. That was torture. I'll never go back there. They treated you like a doormat. You have to have patience with Hollywood. Like hell! The Yanks want your talent to sort out the rubbish written by their own mediocre people. You waiting at home all day in case they call. And here they speak the same language. At times I don't understand a word, but it's the same. So they say. They'll appreciate you here. You'll see, you'll be like Gardel. Gama and Lepera. Peron over there, Franco here. We'll change barracks. Zully and Fatty are coming. -Who told you? -Babsy. Amadori got a great offer. Look, at the Embassy dinner, whatever happens, we'll ask them to sort out our papers. There are so many stories to tell about Spaniards. We've got enough already for eight films. The ships, the misunderstandings, the waiting... Their joy when they arrived, how they kissed the ground in the port. My grandma looked at the bread every day with such fondness. She stroked it, as if it were a kitten. And she ate it all, she didn't leave a single crumb. Hunger must be a terrible thing. We've got no idea what real hunger is like. When we are really keen to eat, we call it "appetite". The people here went hungry, and it's not over yet. Am I as big an ogre as they say? Well... yes and no. Yes, because you are. And no, because I don't care. COMO on! Wait till you see the electricity bill! Don't worry, Rufi. Look, I was thinking that this... Honorio... Honorio is a good boy and he's doing well selling Maria biscuits in La Flioja or Fontaneda biscuits, or whatever he's selling... We still don't know what biscuits he's selling. Anyway... If he really loves the girl, if he does, Rufi, I'd prefer that to winning the Lottery tomorrow. Well, if we can choose, so would I but if we could maybe win a little something. And now, wait till I'm asleep before you start the concert. Hey, hey, I don't snore. I've told you a thousand times. I breathe deeply... -Good morning. -Good morning. Pepito... Good morning, Donia Justa. Tell Paco to bring me a coffee. Did you see? At mass they were all ink-stained. -We just can't catch that idiot. -Thank you. Why don't you go to the chiropodist? Because he can't help. I've gone. All he does is give you ointment that does no good and change your insoles every three months. There's no solution. My problem is I've got bunions like quails' eggs and the big toe on each foot overlaps the other toes, and then I can't raise my heels because if I forget and lift them I see stars. You can't imagine the agony, Don Natalio. I wish I had bunions. -You want to see my bunions? -No. Bring me some cut tobacco, Fulgencio. -And paper too? -Yes, paper too. Cifesa Films? Good morning, I'm Francisco Porrifios. Don Vicente Casanova left a message for me to call. Thank you. Mr. Casanova? I'm Francisco Porrifios, I was told you rang me. Would I like to? There's nothing I'd like more, especially if it's in Cifesa Films, the home of successes. Shooting next week? No, the thing is, I'm called Francisco Porrifios, but my stage name, the one I use in my letters of introduction, is Cesar March. Yes, Cesar March. It's for the famous Alfredo May. Alfredo May, Cesar March. No, no, I don't care. If you think it's necessary for the tone, I'd be delighted. Between "Tenorio" and "The Mayor of Zalamea", How aboutt the end Of the first act of "The Mayor..."? Now? "Estate and life must be given to the king, but honor belongs only to the soul, and the SOUL." Hello? Don Vicente? Mr. Casanova? Hello? You can laugh all the way to hell, bastards! Shit! Nothing, not a hint of a fever. 36.5. That penicillin is a miracle. -One injection, and that's it. -Then do the drawing for me. Come on. Let's do that drawing. Vézquez, telephone. Branch One. The liquidator at Banesto, he says it's urgent. Someone from the Clearing House. -Donia Julia, happy Christmas. -Happy Christmas. Yes? Yes, speaking. What? But that's... That's impossible! Run over? Your wife has been taken to San Carlos, to San Carlos Hospital. To Casualty, I guess. I'm a neighbor of yours, I live at number 12, across the street from you. 1,500. You could have put on a clean shirt. And another tie. IS thiS the suit? The Sunday suit? I'd say it looked better on its late woner. Put on mine. Take my pants. -What's your shoe size? -7 1/2 Listen to me. Take a breath, a deep breath. Like that. And now, repeat after me, I am the general director of Boca. I am the general director of Boca.
