Well, it's not important now and there really isn't enough space to paint here. Wait a minute, wait, didn't you tell me once that all you lived for was to be a great painter? To get your name in-in goofy magazines, like this one here? Well, I didn't mean that. All I want now is to marry you and be with you forever. Uh, wait-wait a minute, not that one, that's mine.

You're from, you're from Kansas, right? - Mm-hmm. - I'm from Boston. It's-it's just outside, about 60 miles from here. Do you have, do you have your baggage claim? I-I think I lost it.

I have a cousin there that I'd like to visit. -Oh. -Yeah. Is there a way that I could get down there? Um, there's a bus that you can take in town, but I don't think you'll have time till after Thanksgiving. Mm-hmm. Oh. Now, are these your folks? That's my dad and my stepmother. -Hm. -That's my mom.

Uh, yeah, it's, uh, over that way, past the water tower. -How far is that? -Uh, about ten miles. -Do you have a car? -No. Well, thanks anyway. What we stress to our incoming students is the importance of taking risks, exploring new horizons, testing yourselves. This is your first year, first milestone, but please don't be afraid to take chances. If you discover a course that interests you, talk to your guidance counselor. I hope you don't mindI borrowed your coat. No, it's... I told you it's okay. Thank you. Each of you has already met with your guidance counselor and we want you to develop that relationship. So, um, do you think you couldgive me a ride later into town? Yeah. Why do you need to go? I'll tell you later. Okay. Hey-hey, sweet thing, over here! The science department faculty has two Nobel Prize winners and over 30 members of the National Academy of Sciences. It's located in the oldest building on campus. But before I take you there, I'd like to take you all the way up the hill to show you our newest building. Hey, Jimmy, what are you looking at, man? Come on, get to work! This is our brand-new art building. Built at a cost of nearly nine million dollars. We've tried to create an ideal working environment for the artist using natural light, large areas of unobstructed wall space and partitioned work areas for the more advanced students. We also have the sculpture bay. And several of our graduates have worked in the permanent collections at the Whitney Museum, the Guggenheim and the Museum of Modern Art. Two currently have paintings in the Whitney Biannual. Brianne, are you alright? Yeah, I'm just not feeling very well. Oh, I'm sorry. Do you still need to go into town? Oh, I changed my mind. You know, I was thinking about, uh, what the counselor said,how we could change our courses. Oh, no, she was talking about next term. This term's classes are already locked in. We start Monday. Hm. Yeah. Well, let's go to dinner. I'm not very hungry. Well, we could go later, that's okay. No, I don't thinkI'm gonna have dinner tonight. Well, you could just come down and have dessert or something. You know what you have to do? You have to make some friends around here. There are gonna be lots of people down there. So go down and eat, okay? Yeah, okay. -Hi! -Give it up for Claire! Do you ride? No, but I wear hats. So what's your first class? Orchestra. Hm. May I see your violin? I used to play. You can have it. I'm nota musician, I'm a painter. Well, then why did you sign up for Orchestra? Because my parentswouldn't sign for my scholarship unless I agreed to keep studying violin. Hm. My dad doesn't tell me what to study. He's more concerned with my image. You know, clothing and so on. You-you can't tell, let your dadtell you how to dress. You have to be your own person. -Like you? -Mm-hmm. I'm on my own now. And if I don't wanna play the violin... I won't. Hm. Right. What are you doing? Whatever it takes. I need to change all my classes from music to art. You'll have to make anappointment with your counselor. -What's your name? -Brianne Dwyer. That'll be Mrs. Donelly. She's in the office right behind you. It says here you had a personal interview with her in July. I'm sure she'll remember you. -Um, is it, uh, vertical? -I think so. -I wouldn't know. -Okay, lady. I can fix you in tomorrow, say 2 o'clock? -Great. -Okay. Okay. -Where is that? -Right down the... We were only married one month, and then one night he just took off. I really hate to get rid of these. But I'm pregnant and I need the money so bad. We're going to haveto forgive her. Get this,the police checked the computer, the parents of Darcy Palmer reported her as missing six months ago, they don't knowanything about a wedding. They don't even know where the bitch is! -She set me up!-Quinn, Quinn, please calm down. Now, I know you're feeling pain,but you need to heal. No. You know what I need? I need a drink. You know where I'm gonna do? I'm going to a bar, the same sleazy bar where I met her six months ago. Quinn? We'll move you to the 2 o'clock class. Alright, buh-bye. -Yeah, of course. -That'll be great... -That's pretty cool. -Yeah. You like it? -Somebody... -God, she's dead. -Over there! -...there. -Ah! -Call 9-1-1! We're here at Wynton College in New Hampshire where a counselor has been seriously injured after using a bottle of eye drops. Details are sketchy at this time, we can tell... -Hi. -...we do know right now... Jeanelle, have you seen this? -I just heard. -Ah, it's so sick. ...it was sulfuric acid in that bottle of eye drops... Oh! Well, have you metZoe, Sabrina? ...blinded in one eye... No. Well, this is my roommate, Jeanelle. Hi. -Hi, hi. -Hey. Hm. ...at least save partial eye sight in that other... Look, there I am, look! Did you see? In the mean time representativesfrom Ekhart Pharmaceutical have arrived here at the collegein New Hampshire to try to determine exactly when the acid may have been put into the... This is gonna give me nightmares. Why would she have brain damage? The sulfuric acidate right into her brain. ...across the country to return any unopened bottles of the allergy-relief eye drops with the... I wonder how many other bottlesthey messed with. Well, that's really nice. Here. What you wanna do to that line is let a little highlight show up more. Good, good. Just bring up the sponge tool and even that out. Nice. And what is abnormal behavior to one person makes perfect sense to another. That's why it's so difficult to define abnormal. And that's why I asked you to be analytical in your description of an abnormal personality. I enjoyed the rigorwith which most of you took to the challenge,particularly, Marney'simpeccably-researched dissection of the soul of Catherine the Great. Now, one of you decided not to follow my instructions and struck out on her own in a direction Would you please stand and read aloud your, I'm not sure what to call it, your, uh, portrait in words, I suppose? Am I in trouble? No, proceed. "There once was a little girl "who lived in a nice little house "with her loving, normal little parents. "But she just couldn't be the nice little girl "they wanted her to be. "So why did all the dolls end upwith their heads twisted off? "Why did all the pets die? "She felt likethere was something dark "living inside of her "making her do terrible things. "And she couldn't stop it. "Her parents stopped being so nice after a while. "They tried to rip the evil out of her. "But that just made the darkness inside of her "bigger and stronger and angry. "That dark thing took a deep breath "and blew those little parents right out of her life. "The little girl looked just the same... "but she wasn't the same anymore. "What was left "could not be stopped. "Just let them try. "Just let them try... to stop me." Though that certainlywasn't the assignment, maybe it should have been, imagine what it feels like to be an abnormal personality. Yeah, that's an A for creativity, Brianne, but an F for the assignment. I'm sorry, but you're just gonna have to master a few of the chillyunemotional facts of psychology if you're gonna pass at midterm.Understood? -Oh, God, I am so sorry! -Oh! That's okay. Hey, you know what,I liked your poem. -Well, thank you. -You want to join us tonight? We're meeting some Harvard guys downtown. Oh, I'd love to, but I havethat F to make up. Why don't you give Jeanelle a call? -She has a car, you know? -Oh! -Hm, a car! -Yeah. -Okay, have fun! -Alrighty! See ya. Dear mom and dad, it was raining today, so I'm staying inside to catch up with my correspondence. Here's a picture of me and some of my friends in the dorm. I feel funny going with your friends if you're not coming. They're your friends, too. Hey, don't be depressed about psych class. Professor Gnap is simply a jerk. That is so true. I mean, it's just such a load, all that crap about taking creative risks. -They're all such hypocrites. -Oh. Hey, Bri! You've got a phone call down the hall! Hello? No, this is a friend of... Well, probably in the library. She practically lives in the library. Usually, pretty late. Would you like to leave a message? -Was that your parents? -Mm-hmm. You know, you can give them the number to the room here. Uh, it's okay, if my parents knew I had a phone in my room, they'd be calling every night. Oh. You don't want the hassle. Nope. Oh, God. I wish I could do that,you know? My dad, just, just tune him out. If my dad were rich, I wouldn't tune him out. Do you want me to close the door? Please. I took notes all week! How am I supposed to writemy paper if I lost my notes? You're the best student in the class, Marney. But how am I supposed to grade you if you don't turn in the assignment? I'm telling you, Professor Gnap gave her an F. It wasn't her fault. That was so unfairwhat happened today. Tell me about it. Wow! Where'd you getthat jacket? Uh, it's Jeanelle's. I helped her get ready for a big date with her dad. She has the most amazing clothesthat she never wears. -I hate her. -So why is her dad in town? He comes about once a month to lecture on economics. I've heard him speak. He's incredibly smart. And he's gorgeous.And he owns half the campus. -Owns? -Helped finance it. Especially the newer buildings. The new dorms, the art department. You know, you should meet him sometime. He must know everyone in the art world. Gallery owners, collectors. -Everyone. -Ah-hah. Well, is he coming to pickJeanelle up here? No, no, she's meeting him over at the lecture hall. Jeanelle! -Hi. -Hi What you doin'? -We're goin' to dinner. -Oh, you're so lucky. I stayed late in the art department. I'm starving. Dad, this is Brianne, my roommate. You didn't tell meyour dad was comin' to town. Well, it is a pleasureto meet you. My pleasure. I've read about you. You helped buildthat new art department. Well, my wife was the driving force behind that one. We have, we have to go, we have a reservation. Hm. More wine, sir? Thank you. No, no. Are you driving yourself home? I'm quite sober. You're planning to come homefor Thanksgiving , aren't you? I suppose. I feel badly for him. I just get so depressed around him. You know, he just sits in his study and broods. Oh, it's because he's living in the past. Hm. I'm sorry. What he thinks is the past. He spends all of his time brooding over a woman who never loved him. All she wanted was his money. That's a horrible thing to say. -Why? -Well... Because she's dead. And he loved her. And now he's alone, so I guess I can't not go home for Thanksgivin'. Why not? Oh, because he's my father, and I love him. And he's a colossal bore.You said so yourself. Yeah, I have an idea. -You do? -Mm-hmm. Why don't you invite some of your friends to come home with you? Sabrina and I would love to see how rich people live. Okay. And Zoey and Marney, too. This must be a really big house. It's a very big house. Oh... ♪ The horse knows the way to carry the sleigh ♪ ♪ Through the white and drifting snow oh ♪ ♪ Over the river and through the woods ♪ ♪ Oh how the wind does blow ♪ It tickles your toes and lifts up your nose ♪ ♪ As over the grounds we go ♪ -Whoo! -Whoo! Wow! So this is the house. Okay, everybody getstheir own private room. The keys are in the cars. And there's a tennis courtaround the back if you care to play. This is John. -Good afternoon, miss. -Good afternoon. If you need anything,you just ask John, except on Sundays when the whole staff is off. Heathcliff lives over here in the north wing, so we'll just leave him alone in his own century and get into trouble! Come on. -Alright. -Okay. Let me take that for you, ma'am. The peasants have been getting a bit too haughty lately, don't you think? -Oh, off with their heads. -Mm-hmm. -Cheers -Indeed. And, uh, bring us another roast pig. Yes! And throw the bonesto our husbands in the dungeon. Which one do we castratetomorrow? -Oh, John, John! -Oh, John, give me some more. -Oh, John. -We won't castrate you, John. -Oh, thank you, miss. -I promise. Is this the 19th century? Something like that. What are you doing here? I got lost. Well, the 1960 are, uh, straight back down the hallway and the rest of the 20th centuryis right around the corner. Do you wish we weren't here? I'm happy that Jeanelle is having a nice Thanksgiving. She wants the same for you. And she's so proud of you. She tells everybody that you're just the greatest. What are you doin' up here? I'm lookin' around. Hm... Well, come downstairswith us, please. -I will. -We're havin' fun. -Hey. -Oh... -Ho. -There. Alright, alright, alright. Come on, you can't... -Yeah! -Whoo-hoo! Oh... Do you like that painting? No, not really. But I'll bet it's worth a ton. It's worth two tons. My wife bought that painting in Paris. Hm. First or second...wife? Second. Well, she certainly hadexpensive taste. I don't like it either. You know, I-I noticedyou watching us outside. You could have joined us. Nah, I'm not in a very celebratory mood these days. What are you looking at? D-do you know that you almost havethe perfect Roman nose? Turn sideways, just like that. Yeah. That's it. Do you knowwhat I'd like to do with you? Brianne! Come on, you guys! Let's make some hot toddies! -Hello, girls. -Ooh, let me see. There you go. -Hey, that's good. -Thank you. I like the way you gave hima haircut. I hope you fixed the bagsunder my eyes. Oh, what bag? We've been looking all overfor you. You'd look good with short hair. Oh, thanks. Why don't you go aheadwith your friends? I, I got some thingsI should do. Okay. I'll show it to you when I'm done. Now, I'm hoping this will convince him to let me cut his hair. Heh-heh. You should. What-what are you doing here? I've come to cut your hair. What on Earthare you taking about? -Cut. Snip, snip. -Huh? Mm, come here. Turn around. Just like Samson and Delilah. -Russell? -Mm, let's see. Uh, in the bathroom, darling. Come on in. I'm giving your fathera haircut. He really needs one. Okay. I-I see. Well, I'll have John send you up some champagne. Sound good? Good. You know, your father's really coming out of his shell. Yeah, he is, and he's makinga complete fool out of himself. I hate him. He's just starting to come around after losing his wife, that's all. He's really not such a bad guy. -Jeanelle. -Well, he's not your father. That's why I can do things for him that you can't. -Such as? -Get him to lighten up. Stop living in the past. You know what? This is between him and me. And I really want you to leave him alone. Period. -Fine. -Fine. Only... I invited him to join us for Thanksgiving dinner. Sorry. See you, guys. Go down to aisle four, it's in an amber-colored bottle. -Uh-huh. -It's on the fourth shelf. Free pizza! Free pizza. Anyone who wants it, down the hall. -Yes. -Ooh! Follow that girl. Jeanelle, want some pizza? -Oh, wow! -Oh, that's horrible. Oh-ho! I can't believe you did this. I have to go out to dinner. Who you going out to dinner with? -My dad. -Oh! You didn't tell me he was comingto town! -Yes. -Sure? Well, maybe I'll just have one little piece. -Nice scenery. -Yeah? -Ooh, ooh.. -Ha-ha-ha.... Are you sure you don't want meto call a nurse? No. I just wanna sleep. Here you go. Look, I don't thinkit was the pizza that-- Don't mention food. My dad... when he calls me... Mm-hmm? Do you think that she's alright? I mean, maybe I should call a doctor. No, it's justa little tummy upset. She just wants to sleep,that's all. And I knew if you'd callthe room, you'd wake her. Well, that was very thoughtful of you to come all the way over here to tell me. Mm, I don't mind. I didn't have anything to dotonight anyway. So Wynton College is just a stop for me. You know, a chance for me to build my portfolio on my way to New York. You're so sure of yourself. My first wife was like that. -Jeanelle's mom? -Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, Jeanelleis nothing like her mother. She's much more like me. I guess that's whywe have such a hard time. Uh-uh. No way are you as insecure as Jeanelle. Where do you come from? I mean, what, did you springfrom Zeus' head, fully formed? I mean, you have to besomebody's little girl. I don't belong to anyone. I blew off my parents a long, long time ago. And I plan to never see them again. I am nota little girl like Jeanelle. You're right, you're not, I agree. I'm sorry,I didn't mean to patronize you. I just meant that I have long-range plans. My parents just didn't understand it. And you can't set limits on yourself when you're an artist. You know? Maybe after dinneryou can show me your paintings. I'd love that. God, these are very...powerful images. You must, you must realize how much they contradictyour appearance. Mm, no, I never thought of it like that. When I paint, I deal with forcesoutside of my rational control. I don't even remember painting that face. Where do images like that come from for you? A woman crammed into a box. I don't knowwhere they come from. I don't know what they mean. I don't care. God, I wish I could go with my imagination the way you do. Oh, but you could.Don't you know that? Come on. When it comes right down to it, all we are is energy. And when something truly moves you, when you feel it deep down inside... you shouldn't fight it. You should go with it. What's important to you at this very moment? I guess,what comes to mind is Jeanelle. You were sick! I didn't want him to phone the room and wake you! I mean, God, I try to do something nice for you, you just jump down my throat! I'm not jumping down your throat. I just asked. How was I supposed to know thathe would invite me to dinner? And what's so wrong with saying yes? So he wouldn't have to eat alone, huh? I don't know. I'm just, I'm confused, you know? Obviously, I don't understand what's going on here. All we did was talk about you. How proud he is of you. Then what did he say? Just how you and him are so alike... and how you never let him down. It used to be that way. Look... I just feel lucky to have the chanceto know the both of you. Well, I've never had a friend quite like you myself. I have some really good news. You do? Your father wants to sponsora gallery showing of my work. Oh! -Congratulations. -Thank you! Brianne, another message from your mom. Thanks. When I paint, I feel like Brianne just crumbles away... and a creature emerges that's a stranger. You know, the other night... you said that sounded a lot like being in love. Well, it's actually more like sex. What are you thinking about at this very moment? I, I can't even tell you. Why not? Russell? Oh. Hi. You were supposed to meet me at 3:30. I'm sorry. I know I completelylost track of the time. I've been waiting for over half an hour. -See you Monday. -Okay. Jeanelle? Have fun. Jeanelle, I just stopped by totell her about the photographer who's coming on Monday, and we got to talking. If you wanna be in therewith her, that's fine. -But don't make plans with me. -Jeanelle, don't be silly. This is not about me choosing between you and Brianne. I didn't mean to have an outburst, I apologize. I know I'm not a great athlete or artist, but my consistency should count for something. I want you to love me for who I am. And if that's being selfish,then I'm sorry. You're not selfish. Wait, wait. You're not selfish. Brianne is simply a girl with talent who needs a break and I happen to think she deserves it. She's a beautiful young woman, yes, but I have no other interests in her. Man, that's good, I hope not 'cause you're old enough to be her father. Anthony is gonna select one of the slides for the ad and place it in the major art publications. Oh, and also, there's an art critic coming from "The Boston Globe" to talk with you tomorrow afternoon at 3:00. Oh! The newer pieces have a kind of sinister elegance... Don't care what they thinkof your painting. -Just go out and have fun. -Oh, I like that. Just have the conversation. Have the conversation with them and hear what they think. I mean, look at all these people. -Oh, hi, Dan. -Maybe he's truly fond of her. Is that so terrible? How would you feel if it was your father? Have you ever seen her father? -Heh-heh. That is true. -No, I've not. You know, maybe he really thought she's talented. Very comfortable with my talent. The other thing I wanted to tell you is that there's a man here tonightfrom The Renwick in New York. Now, if everything goes okay,he's gonna invite you to show there in April when they have a little gapin their schedule. -What do you think? -Oh! Thank you! Girl, how you doing? Are you enjoying the show? It's raw talent. I guess that's what people respond to. -What about you? -I think I'm gonna drink. -Right on. -Alright. No good. Congratulations. I heard you sold something last night. Three pieces. All undervalued. You must have been out celebrating. Is that where you were all night? Now, that isnone of your business. It is my business. He's my father. Did it ever occur to you that perhaps there's somethingin this for him, too? That perhaps I can offer him things that no one else can? You should know that I can haveyou expelled from the school. I decided to clean your side of the room last night. You mean, you went through my things. I did. And guess what I found. I found Marney's missing notebook and test papers. None of them belonged to you. I think Dean Kirkland should know. I'm sorry. I got ya. What are you doing here? Did you thinkI was gonna miss this? Huh? Who the hell is Brianne Dwyer? A pseudonym. Oh... Guess who came to the wedding? All my friends, my family,everybody, except for you! You were gone,with my money, my rings! And your family and your parentsdidn't even know about it. How did you know that? A detective called them. Yeah. You ran away from home,didn't ya? Just like you ran awayfrom me! Why? -I was scared. -What? Of me? No. Of everything. I was afraid that if I told youthat, you would hate me forever. And the minute I left, I wanted to come back. I tried to write you. I wanted to be with you. I really did, Quinn. You expect me to believe that? It's true. -Where are my rings? -Aah! Quinn... They're in, they're in my room. I, I saved them for us, for us. Go get 'em, now,or you're gonna get hurt. -Okay. -Do you understand me? I'll wait for youunder that tree right outside your dorm. You go get me those rings! Okay. Okay. Maybe then I'll believe you. Okay. Okay. Okay. Why did you lock the door? Did you tell the dean? She wasn't in. Look, I'm in a lot of trouble. And it would mean a lot to me... if you would try to understand. I'm listening. Things will get even worse if I don't go out right nowand take care of something. Jeanelle, we were once friends. Can't you give metill tomorrow morning? Okay. Thank you. -Did you get 'em? -I got something better. Look, I owe $5000on those rings! God bless America. So, um... trust me now? Aah! I had that coming. Take me back? Quinn? You know, uh, maybe we shouldn'tstop so close to the college. Why? You thinksomebody's following us? You think they're after us? Alright. You're right. They probably won't notice that the stuff is missing until tomorrow. So what are you worried about? Nothing. Mm! Hey, cut it out! Darcy, what are you doing? -Give me the keys, Quinn. -Aah! Quinn, give me the keys right now. I don't like the way that you've been treating me lately, sweetheart. If I had known that you were a wife beater, I never would have gotten engaged to you. I'm calling the police. -What for? -To report you for stealing. I guess you can explain that, too. You just saw me put them back! I know it's hard for you to understand because you've always had a father who you could go to, who-who would just go and fix anything for you. Alright. I-I owed a guy some money. A lot of money. He's been calling meand threatening me. Jeanelle,I couldn't steal from you even though I have nowhere elseto get the money. Why didn't you ask to borrow it? Because you were so angryabout your father, I did not think that'd be a good idea. Your new counselor wants to see you tomorrow morning. On Saturday? Did you tell her? Nope. Haven't told anyone yet. But she sent a yellow slip, so it must be important. Come in. Good morning. -You wanted to see me? -Well, yes. Don't you two have anything to say to each other? That isn't my daughter. I met your daughter at the airport. She was running away, and she asked me to help her. Brianne was unhappy at home. But she'd just gotten her scholarship. Why would she run away? She was pregnant. She was running offto San Francisco to get married. But her boyfriendwas from Indianapolis. That's all she told me! That is all I know! Who are you? My name is...is Darcy Palmer. And I came here from Nevada. I ran away from home, too. My family hates me, and I didn't know what to do. And then I met Brianne and she... she offered me this opportunityto come here and to paint. It's been five months. Anythingcould've happened to her. Did she say wherein San Francisco she was going? No. No. She, she said she was gonna call me, but she didn't. She never wrote. I never heard from her. I'm glad you're here, though. I knew this couldn't last. It was never supposed to lastthis long. I promise you. You sent us pictures. You wrote us letters. You signed her name. I-I-I have to find my daughter. -I-I'm gonna call the police. -Please, let me handle this. We must report your daughter's missing, but I'd like to speak with the dean first. You'll have to vacate the dorm immediately. Beyond that, I don't know what will happen. Could you call Russell Polk for me? Mm. I would've figured this out. I would've told you. Did you think I could keep it a secret forever? Well, it's too latefor that now, isn't it? So what? We're just gonna go on hating each other forever? What difference does it make? It'll make a difference when you come home for visits. Your father invited me to stay with him at the house until I get back on my feet. When did you talk to my father? Ms. Perry's office. And after what you did, he invited you to stay? Well, at least he had the decency to offer a little compassion. -Hi, John. -Brianne? You and Ihad better have a talk. I'm surprised you're still speaking. Come on. John will take careof your things. I wanna show you the spacethat we fixed up for you. -For me? -Mm-hmm. Excuse me, is Jeanelle Polk there? Come in. Hi. I'm Evelyn Dwyer. Brianne's mother. The real Brianne. I-I need to talk to you. Well, please, sit down. I-I'm just trying to figure outwhat happened here. We had our problems. But Brianne wouldn't do this. I-I don't thinkthat my ex-roommate is telling the whole truth. Oh. No. Neither do I. But I don't think that counselor's telling the whole truth, either. You see... Brianne was here over the summer for a face-to-face interview. That woman knew what she looked like. So what... H-how in God's name could she not have known? I'd like the directory assistance for Reno, Nevada, please. I don't want you to think that this means that I approve of what you've done. Obviously, I don't. But I do understand your passion for art,. for painting. You must've boughtthe whole store! Ha-ha! Well, I didn't know exactly what you'd need. You probably know that Jeanelleisn't gonna approve of this even though it's temporary. That's putting it mildly. She feels quite threatenedby you. I hope you'll be sensitiveto that. Of course I will. -I love her very much. -I know. And if she doesn't want me here,I'll leave. Oh, no, no, I don't want that. I'm Jeanelle Polk. I'm lookingfor the parents of Darcy Palmer. -What for? -Who am I speaking with? I'm her uncle, Noah Palmer. She said she ran away. Who, who is this? -I'm Brianne's roommate. -Who? I'm sorry. Darcy. She said her name was Brianne. She's in New Hampshire. Well, it isn't exactly a professional studio, but at least it's a place to hang your imagination until something else more permanent comes along. What's the matter? What? It's just thatyou've done so much for me. I've opened a few doors, that's all. How do you know it's her? Can you send us a picture? Uh-huh. Uh, I don't think I have one. -Can you send me one? -I could do that. Okay, listen, my fatherhas a fax machine in his house. You can send it directly there. Do you knowwhat I'd really like? Brianne... Darcy, you don't... You don't, you don't have to, you don't owe me anything. This is for both of us. Don't stop there. Come here... Heh-heh. Okay. That was my mother's. These are allmy mother's things. Not the robe. This belonged to Samantha. -It suits you. -Hm. Look, if you're gonna make this a battle between the two of us... who do you think your father's gonna choose? Who did he choose last time? This could be so terrific for-for us, for the both of us. I mean... we could be like sisters. Jeanelle, I tried to call you this morning. What, to warn me? Jeanelle? Jeanelle? Jeanelle, what was I supposed to do? -Throw her out on the street? -You know what? -You don't owe her anything. -Jeanelle, believe me. Believe me, you come first.You always-- I am not jealous! I'm not asking you to understand. Then don't explain it to me. I'm just asking younot to judge me or her. She's stolen things, she's cheated, she's lied. -Maybe worse.-What do you mean "Maybe worse?" -And we don't even know-- -Jeanelle... What she did was wrong,but that doesn't make her an evil person. -What does it make her? -She's misguided. I-I... She can be helped.I can help her. Oh, Jeanelle... Don't walk away from me when I'm talking to you. Who are you? What do you mean? I talked to your unclethis morning and he sent me this picture. Can I see it? He said that you, she disappeared a year ago. This is me. You know, I was beginning to think that that would always be me,you know, just like all the others. What others? I lost count. They all disappeared just like Brianne... just like you. They'll say you were jealous, that you were angry at your father and that you ran away. Ow! Ah! Daddy! Daddy! Jeanelle! Darcy! Daddy! Daddy! Da... -Jeanelle! Darcy! I'm coming!-Daddy... I'm here. Coming! What is it? What? I'm here... It's okay. It's alright. Everything is okay. Jeanelle is very upset. She came after mewith a pair of scissors. No, I didn't! She tried to kill me and tell you that I ran away! She slashed my canvasand then she came after me. It was like, it was likethere was another person inside of herthat was about to explode. -Russell, she needs help. -Huh? I-I really think that she needs a sedative. -What? -And I'll stay with her. And you call the hospital, okay? Shut up! Somebody else didn't do this!You did this! This is who you are! You killed Brianne and you probably killedDarcy, too. -You're lying-- -I am not lying! And I don't even think that you know you're lying! -But you're lying! -Jeanelle, my God you're hurt. Daddy, don't let her go!Don't let her go! She did that to herself right there! I am an artist! And you tried to set limits on who I can be! And I don't allow anyone to do that! You hear me? -I gotta get out of here. -You don't let her go. -Calm down! Calm down! -Don't let her go. And just relax, just relax. -Ow! -No! Don't... -Stop it! Stop it! -Let me go! Let me go! Nobody, nobody is going to hurt you. -No! She's a... -Don't let her go. But this is nowa matter for the police. You just don't understand, do you? But that's okay... 'cause nobody understands my secrets. I don't even care if you call the police... 'cause no one can touch me. Brianne Dwyer, Darcy Palmer, both gone without a trace. The dates of disappearance mesh nicely. She killed Brianne and Darcy, too, probably. -She said there were others. -Well, let's see if we... Yeah. Bingo. There it is. It's a special alert across ten states. Looks like there's been a stringof unexplained disappearances over the past six years all leading back to a blonde teenager, Barbara Richards, who is described as "Childlike" and walked away from her parents' burning farmhouse in Indio, California. Parents were still inside. God, I guess we were lucky. Well, we won't know for a few days, but I'd say you caught our killer for us, Mr. Polk. Allen? Excuse me. Look, I know we got to charge her, but it's hard to believe that this little girl is the one that started the fight. Yeah, well,this little girl is dangerous. So make sure you cuff her. Who are you? I was almost you. Dispatch, this is unit 31. Do you need any backup at the Polk residence? You are very precious to me. You don't believe me, do you? It's your word against theirs. They have all the money, I have nothing. It doesn't mean he can spit on the law. What can I do? And they're gonna say terrible things about me. Can you help me? If they can't find any hard evidence against you, you got nothin' to worry about. Are these handcuffs really necessary? Once we're down the road, I'll take 'em off.
