[Poignant classical music over dialogue] [Narrator] The first world war, one of the bloodiest conflicts in human history. 10 million died, its killing field stretched over 3 continents. Many people think of the conflict as a predominantly European white war. But in fact over a third of the manpower under imperial British command were non-whites, drawn from Asia, Africa and the Caribbean. Forgotten men who fought and died for king and empire. Through the testimonies of surviving veterans and the evidence of secret records we reveal the story of the British west indies regiment. 16,000 men who served on every major battlefront of the war. [Narrator] This is a story of war and the fight for freedom. It is a story of loyalty to empire. [Julian Putkowski] If you want to measure a mutiny in terms of its seriousness you only have to look at punishments, which were meted out to men involved in Taranto to realise that it was taken extremely seriously, these men were treated in an exemplary fashion. [Narrator] It is also a story of betrayal which ended with a violent mutiny. This is the story of that mutiny, and its repercussions for the British empire. [Jolly violin music] In 1914 after 300 years of slavery and colonial rule, most black people in the British west indies were loyal subjects of the empire. At the outbreak of the first world war in August that year the Caribbean colonies immediately forwarded pledges of support. In Jamaica 24 year-old farm worker Clifford Powell, was eager to fight for king and the country he is now 110 years old. [Narrator] In the Caribbean the press kept black people informed of war news. West Indians though few in number gave generously for the war effort, raising 2 million in cash alone, approximately 60 million at today's rates. Throughout the islands west Indian men made repeated attempts to volunteer to fight for king and empire. Many were encouraged by the charismatic leadership of Jamaican black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who was campaigning for greater rights for black people. [Glenford Howe] At the outbreak of the war Garvey was very quick to express his support for Britain. Garvey even sent a telegram expressing his support for Britain in the war. [Narrator] We the members of the universal negro improvement and conservation association hereby express our loyalty and devotion to his majesty the king and empire. [Narrator] Garvey hoped honourable sacrifice on the battlefield would earn black people the right to political power after the war. Meanwhile in Trinidad CLR James, who went on to become an eminent journalist, historian, and author, tried to enlist. Later he wrote of his experience. [Narrator] Though I was dark I was tall and very fit. I went to the office where one of the big merchants examined would-be warriors. When my turn came, I walked to his desk. He took one look at me, saw my dark skin and shaking his head vigorously, motioned me violently away. [Putkowski] It was very difficult for black men from the west indies to volunteer to serve in the British army, some went to extreme lengths smuggling aboard ships and coming to London, trying desperately to demonstrate support for the empire. And basically the British would not have anything of it. [Narrator] Clr James did not join the army, it was an incident he never forgot. [Marching] James like many other would-be soldiers had been the victim of a secret policy to prevent black men from signing up. The colonial office told recruitment personnel to discourage coloured volunteers. In a confidential memo circulated in 1914. The war office also wanted to prevent black soldiers from fighting alongside British forces in Europe, under its leader lord kitchener it sent a series of memos spelling out his opposition to black recruits, they argued that in the hands of such natives guns would make black soldiers a greater danger to friends than the enemy, and that there was a common sense objection to enlisting black men as their colour would render them conspicuous in battle. [Julian putkowski] There was always a danger that German propaganda machine may turn around and ridicule the British army for having to rely on black troops to fight for them. In other words that they were such inadequate lousy fighters they had to get what they saw as the racial dregs of the British empire to come and fight the battles for them. [Boom!] The generals believed the war would be over within months. [Farrar-Hockley] British expectations of the way the war would be fought were the same as that of France, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Russia, that it would be a matter of manoeuvring armies in the field which came upon one another and clashed, [canon fire] There is tremendous spilling of blood and as the beaten army runs away and the victorious army then advances to the next strategic objective until there is a victory it did not happen like that. [Narrator] Instead it quickly bogged down in the stalemate, muck and slaughter of trench warfare, the soldiers endured horrific conditions in the trenches and thousands of men met their death as they went over the top. By 1915 the enormous numbers of men being killed and wounded had created a severe shortage of manpower, throughout the empire kitchener had the war office recruiting mass-armies of civilian volunteers to replace the decimated ranks. In the circumstances the colonial and war offices could no longer dismiss the patriotic requests from patriotic men in the west indies especially as their case had now come to the attention of king George V. [Glenford Howe] Fortunately for the west Indians king George, who was very much in tune with developments in the Caribbean, heard what was happening and indicated to the war office and to the colonial office that the west Indians should be allowed to participate in the war. [Narrator] On the 17th of April 1915 the king George's secretary, lord Stamfordham, sent a letter to the colonial office stating that: His majesty cannot help thinking that it would be politic to gratify the wish of the west indies to send a regiment to the front, they might be usefully employed in Egypt. A week later kitchener agreed to the king's request but stated that he would dictate where they served, and they must go where they are ordered. In may 1915, a month after king George's intervention, the war office finally agreed to formation of a west Indian contingent, and in late October the new west indies regiment was formed. Once the way was open black patriots rushed to answer the call for volunteers. In British Guiana 18 year-old Gershon Browne, now 101, saw the chance to fulfil his boyhood dreams. [Narrator] However, not everyone was driven by idealism. 18 year-old Clennell Wickham was recruited in Barbados. His sister Barbara was 10 years-old at the time and remembers the reasons for him leaving. [Barbara Wickham] Well they wanted to get out I guess, I think it was good for them to get out under any circumstances, you know to change the conditions, because it was a slave mentality in the place you understand. [Narrator] In the early 1900s blacks in the west indies were primarily agricultural labourers working for for starvation wages, there was high unemployment. Eugent Clarke volunteered as a 21 year old he is now 106. Between 1915 and 1918 over 16,000 men joined up to serve with the new regiment. But more than 13,000 were rejected. Many white west Indians refused to allow the war to blur the rigid colour barriers that dominated colonial life, rather than serving with black men, they formed their own contingents. The British west indies regiment was to be mainly black and coloured men who would never be permitted to rise above the rank of sergeant. All of their commanding officers would be white. Once recruited the soldiers faced a tough regime of basic training. Clifford Powell is the British army oldest known WWI veteran, and remembers his training vividly. By October 1915 the first British west indies contingent was finally on its way to England. [Barbara Wickham] The boat was supposed to leave in the evening, and my father told my mother the boat had not left yet, so she dressed and came down. And she tied some money in a handkerchief. It seemed that he had a premonition that he would see her so he came out on the deck and he was looking around and then as she saw him she waves and he waves back, and she threw this money and he caught it. [Narrator] Even as the soldiers were leaving some locals did not take the regiment seriously. [Narrator] But newspaper reports of the time captured the mood of the overwhelming majority in the Caribbean: We will be fighting to prove to Britain we are not so vastly inferior to whites, that we should at least have political equality with them. Citizens of a world empire whose watchword should be Liberty, equality and brotherhood [civil rights song] Negroes everywhere, negroes in this hemisphere, come come in crowd, come let us all be proud. [Narrator] In march 1916 the troopship Verdala set sail for Europe carrying soldiers of the British west indies regiment. [Narrator] Although the soldiers had high hopes of catching the kaiser winning glory on the battlefield, their illusions were cruelly shattered long before the war zones. In early 1916 the troopship Verdala had set sail for Europe carrying soldiers of the British west indies regiment. On board were 1,115 black soldiers and 25 white officers in the Atlantic, German submarines had become a deadly menace to allied shipping and so the Verdala was forced north via Halifax, Canada, there it ran into a blizzard. Although their ship was unheated the soldiers had only been given lightweight tropical uniforms to wear. Eugent Clarke was fortunate to survive. [Narrator] In fact the British army winter uniforms were on the ship, but were not issued until it was too late. Lieutenant colonel wood hill, a white officer serving with the British west indies regiment took the unusual steps of not only speaking up for the black soldiers under his command but also challenging his senior officers. From the outset wood hill bombarded the war office with letters and memos which he subsequently incorporated into his war memoirs. [Wood hill] Many west Indians lost their life on the ship from the west indies to England and this was entirely due to the fact that they were unsuitably clothed, no warm underclothing, no overcoats, and sick accommodation totally unsuitable. [Narrator] The disaster did not make the British press but it was reported in Canadian papers which were also received in the west indies. More than 600 men were badly frostbitten, 106 stayed in Halifax to have amputations 200 survivors, including eugent Clarke, were taken to Bermuda to convalesce. [Narrator] Eugent Clarke recovered sufficiently, and was able to continue on the journey to Europe. In 1916 by the time British west indies troops had crossed the Atlantic and were ready to fight the British army was waging more war on a number of fronts, in Africa, Europe, the Mediterranean and middle east. 3 battalions departed to Egypt, the rest were sent to sreve on the western front, in France and Belgium, at a secret meeting of British officers held in Cairo, which was attended by wood hill it was decided the British west indies regiment would not be allowed to fight on the frontline in Europe. Wood hill tried to make his superiors reconsider the decision: [Wood hill] It is absolutely essential for the war office to drop the idea that the role of these men should simply be to carry ammunition and to do the general work of labour battalions. [Narrator] But hit was an apply that fell on deaf ears. And so British west indies troops on the western front were never allowed to serve as combat soldiers. Instead, their role at battles like the Somme, Arras, and Ypres was to help unload and transport the mountains of ammunition and food needed to sustain the imperial forces, and supply the millions of tons of high explosive shells fired by the artillery. [Gunshots] Eugent Clarke served at Ypres and the battle of the Somme, here for men from the tropics the Germans would not be the only enemy. [Letter] Dear mother and father, I hope this picture of your soldier boy will reach you without any trouble on its way home. [Narrator] Letters from the front were the only means of communication with those left behind. [Letter] I thought it best to get my photo taken and send to my friends at home. I hope that you have not forgotten to write me, as I am longing to get a word from you with love and kisses for all, yours Frederick. [Narrator] Other letters told of added problems facing the west Indian soldiers. From the western front Harry brown, a chaplain serving with the regiment, would write: [Harry brown] I visited the barracks today, and discovered German prisoners warm and comfortable, their rooms adequately heated by stoves, and in the same barracks west India boys on the extreme top floor without warming apparatus of any kind, cold and suffering. [Narrator] It had become obvious that they were suffering racial discrimination. Their mood of disillusionment was captured in more poems like the black soldier laments: With deep lament we did our job, despite the shame our manhood robbed we built and fixed and fixed again, to prove our worth as proud black men and hasten sure the kaiser ends stripped to the waist and sweated chest, midday reprieve much needed rest we dug and hauled and lifted high, from trenches deep towards the sky non-fighting troops, and yet we die. [Narrator] In the middle east, on the Mesopotamian and Palestine fronts the remaining battalions were finally allowed a combat role. Under the command of general Allenby, two British west indies battalions were fighting the Turkish army in deir El Belah in Palestine. [Julian putkowski] The one occasion upon which west Indian troops took to the field fought alongside the Australian light horse, some of the finest fighters in the world, and stood up extremely well, they were deployed against Turks, this was not seen as contradictory because of course the Turks were seen to be a lesser race as well. [Narrator] Gershom Browne was with the fighting force which captured the strategic bridge over the Jordan, cutting off the Turks retreat. [Bang bang!] [Narrator] The British west indies regiment were congratulated by general Allenby: Who wrote that such a complete victory has seldom been known in history of war. And 16 soldiers from the regiment were decorated for their bravery. [Farrar-Hockley] The Turks were important allies of the main combat impasse Germany and Austria-Hungary and when they were defeated just before the end of the war in the rest of Europe, the Germans realised this was yet another factor why the war had been lost. So the effort in the middle east is something we cannot pass over as being entirely a British, or a British and white commonwealth effort. It was not. [Excited crowds] [Narrator] On 11th November 1918 two months later, armistice was declared and 4 years of war had finally come to an end. And with the war finally over many British troops were on their way home. But the British west indies regiment never saw Blighty for them there was to be a further brutal twist in the tale. The British west indies regiment from all fronts were finally assembled at Cimino, a military camp in the port town of Taranto in southern Italy. They were housed in barracks which still stand. They were more than 8,000 British west indies troops waiting to return to the Caribbean. After the euphoria of victory, the British west Indians regiment sensed to change in attitude from their white counterparts. A British west Indian sergeant painted a damning picture of the camp in an anonymous letter. [Letter] We have no rights or privileges, are treated neither as Christians or as British citizens but as west Indian niggers, with anybody to be interested in or look after us. [Narrator] After enduring months of discrimination then came yet another injustice. British soldiers were given a pay rise of six pence per day: [Julian putkowski] That pay rise was denied the British west Indian troops. They were upset by this because they felt they were being discriminated against, and more importantly that complaints on this issue were not treated seriously. [Narrator] Coming on top of treatment they had suffered on the journey to the war fronts, and the shame of being in a war but prevented from fighting, on 6th December 1918 the situation reached boiling point. Incensed by orders of not just to wash the dirty clothes of of white troops and Italian labourers, but to clean the toilets as well, members of the British west indies regiment refused to obey the command. They attacked their offices and severely assaulted their unit commanders. A bomb was thrown into the tent of colonel Willis, the officer who had issues the inflammatory orders. For a further 3 days there was open rebellion, as the black troops were the majority at Cimino, they effectively had controlled the camp. The mutineers continually defied their officers, there were violent reprisals against those who tried to enforce military discipline, they stabbed and shot at anyone who tried to restore order. On 9th December, brigadier general Crowe, base commandant at Cimino, sent an urgent telegram to the war office: [Telegraph sound] [Julian putkowski] First news was communicated to general headquarters that something wrong at Taranto occurred with the sending of a telegram: Disaffection and acts of insubordination spreading amongst west indies battalions, strongly urge same battalions be immediately embarked to Egypt, Malta, Salonika, or Marseilles where other troops present, am hoping to affect disarmament today. That is a worried man. [Narrator] Secret telegrams, some only made public in 1998 reveal the sense of chaos and panic at the camp, that shook the British army. After 4 days, the mutineers ended their protest and surrendered. The entire regiment was humiliatingly disarmed. Although the battalions had been disarmed, the situation was still unsettled. The following day on 11th September, Crowe sent another telegram to the war office: [Crowe] Disarmament completed of all British west indies battalions, situation still unsettled, white personnel all quiet generally. [Narrator] His final sentence was telling: [Crowe] Battalion of white troops absolutely necessary here! [Narrator] The following day the war office in London telegraphed army HQ in Italy: [War office] Please take steps to deal with above situation, including dispatch of troops if necessary to restore order at Taranto. [Narrator] By now, the senior British officers in Italy were desperate to restore their authority: [GHQ Italy] To restore order at Taranto 1 infantry battalion and half machine gun company are being dispatched there today. [Julian putkowski] They were so worried about the situation at Cimino, that 40 machine gun company was mobilised to overawe the troops with machine guns and probably to use them, and also artillery was put on standby, if necessary the authorities were prepared to go and shell the camp flat. [Narrator] The British army were determined to punish the men for their actions but the mutiny had set in process a new attitude. Members of the British west Indians regiment were now convinced their only way forward was to fight for civil rights for black people on their return to the Caribbean. What followed would shake the foundations of the British empire. After the mutiny general Crowe was relieved to his post, and a tougher man brought to restore order. Brigadier general Cary-Barnard the new commander was South African, and the man to be feared. Captain Cipriani, a white officer of the British west indies regiment, wrote of the the racial bigotry of the new commander: [Cipriani] Brigadier general Cary-Barnard stated that he had no intention of treating west Indians like British troops, that they were only niggers, and better treated than any nigger had a right to expect, that he would order them to do whatever work he pleased, and if they objected he would force them to do it. [Narrator] Cary-Barnard's attitude was also reflected in the rules of the camp, the west Indian soldiers were prevented not only from using the camp cinema and recreational facilities, but their movement was also restricted. Cary-Barnard was given the task of dealing with the mutineers through a wave of court martials that quickly followed. Most of the soldiers who led the resistance were convicted of mutiny. They received sentences of either 3 or 5 years in prison, one man received 20 years. One of the mutinees had been shot and killed, and a second, private Denny, was executed by a firing squad. [Julian putkowski] If you want to measure a mutiny in terms of its seriousness, you only have to look at punishments which were meted out to the men that were involved in Taranto to realise that it was taken extremely seriously, these men were treated in an exemplary fashion. [Narrator] A week after the mutiny, on 17th December, 60 members of the BWI regiment held a secret meeting risking severe punishment by Cary-Barnard, they discussed how best to advance civil rights for black people in the Caribbean on their return. The meeting led to formation of an organisation called the Caribbean league, the men were determined, and that the meeting they agreed that: The black man should have freedom and govern himself in the west indies, and if necessary force and bloodshed should be used to attain these aims. [Julian putkowski] It is an act of great courage, it is certainly an act which one of the sergeants realised, could end up with them in a great deal of trouble. At one meeting one of the sergeant standing up and saying look fellows, we have just seen the British Tommies annihilate the Germans, if we carry on in this way this could also happen to us! [Narrator] But the league were betrayed; one of its member informed commanding officers that the league had seditious designs on return to the west indies. In effect, accusing them of revolution. For a world recently shocked by workers seizing power in the Russian revolution, this was a serious charge. It was now 6 months after the war, British west indies regiment were impatient to go home But unknown to them, the authorities were considering extending their army service for and indefinitely period. In an internal memo a colonial office official, Gilbert Grindle recommended that: [Grindle] The British west indies regiment should serve a further term to punish them for their misbehaviour, as they are cheap compared with white troops. If they are in a truculent state they should be brought to their senses, before they are let loose in the west indies. [Narrator] But the war office finally decided decided on repatriation. By September 1919 the last of the west Indian troops were allowed to leave Taranto. However, the colonial office advised the admiralty that 3 cruisers carrying royal marines with machine guns should be stationed at Barbados, Trinidad and Jamaica in case of unrest. And the white ruling class in the Caribbean thought it unwise to give a heroes welcome to the mutineers on their return. [Ben Bousquet] The colonial office were terrified when west Indians were returning home, because they were returning home, they were well-trained soldiers, they were politically aware, they knew what the problems were, they were aware how they were treated, and they were able to relate that with the conditions of people in their own country. [Narrator] On their return to the west indies veterans like Clennell Wickham now refused to accept the racially based social and political systems of colonial life. [Barbara Wickham] First Sunday that he was back from the army, went in the church very early we all baptised at, but they used to have the coloured people sitting in a certain row. He had just come back from the army, he still had his soldiering uniform on. He walked in and sat down without looking to see if he was on the right or left side and our sexton came and told him he cannot sit there. Our sexton is black too, but he had to do what he was told, so he told him he cannot sit down there this is where the white people sit, he cannot sit there. So he got up, he walked out of the church and he never went back to church again. [Narrator] Clennell Wickham went on to become the editor of the campaigning newspaper the Barbados herald. The paper became a powerful voice for black civil rights, leading many campaigns including the fight to end child labour in the cane fields. Many veterans took up the struggle to improve situation for black people in the Caribbean among them were captain cipriani from Trinidad, and private Norman Manley who 40 years later would lead his country, Jamaica, to independence. [Ben Bousquet] Manley and cipriani were shocked into becoming politically aware from what they actually saw, when they saw how their people were being treated and they suddenly saw their role. They went home with a desire to get a degree of political autonomy out of the British government. [Narrator] The immediate post-war years saw mass unemployment and economic hardship, there was a mood of dissatisfaction which quickly began to worsen. Strikes and riots erupted throughout the west indies, and to quell the situation the British chose a desperate solution, encourage the veterans to emigrate: [Glenford Howe] Plans were put in place to ship them to Cuba, packages were offered to the soldiers to remigrate to Cuba, and that was one way in which the local authorities attempted to deal with the situation. [Narrator] Over 4,000 men, a third of veterans who returned home were relocated to Cuba, which at the time was an American controlled territory. Eugent Clarke was one of them. [Narrator] Eugent lived in Cuba for 12 years before returning to Jamaica. But many men like Clifford Powell, would remain to stablish part of the thriving community of west Indians. [Narrator] Colonel wood hill was one of the few in authority prepared to admit to abuses which black the soldiers of the British west indies regiment had suffered: [Wood hill] There have been west Indians employed on various duties in France, Italy, Egypt, east Africa and Mesopotamia, and whether one speaks to officer, NCO or man it has always been the same heartbreaking tale of humiliation and disillusion. In the Caribbean the British west indies regiment is well remembered, but in Britain their contribution has rarely been acknowledged in the history books. [Ben Bousquet] Our right to be heard for the role our fathers played in the first world war has to be drummed into hearts and minds, and into history books thank god now we have got so many young historians pushing these things across [farrar-Hockley] If you take an island like Jamaica which sent a battalion to France, and what was behind it in terms of getting people trained and supplied and so on, from the Jamaican peoples point of view that was quite a considerable effort, it gets dwarfed or swamped one should say, by the effort of the greater populace and the greater numbers in the theatre of war. [Julian putkowski] What we have here is actually a white officer view of world war 1 and that view I would argue predominates certainly until the last 20 years, it is only in the last 20 years that things have begun to change. It is not political correctness, it is a matter of identifying something more than the narrow sectional exclusive view of the war. [Narrator] It is clear that the mutiny and its repercussions are still uncomfortable events in British history and perhaps the answer lies in a memo sent in late 1919 by Gilbert grindle to other colonial officers: [Grindle] Nothing we can do will alter the fact that the black man has begun to think and feel himself as good as the white. [Narrator] There are plans for a memorial gate honouring the commonwealth war effort to be erected in London in the year 2000, but to fill the gap in the history books we have to rely on the fading memories of the veterans themselves.
