Sir! Some girls have come to meet you. Girls? What do l have to do with girls? You might not. But we want to meet you. Greetings. Greetings. Who are you? - We are the students of A.V. College. What do you want? - We don't have a girl's hostel in our college. We have come to ask donation for that. - How much donation? We are sure you'll give us at least 5,000. - 5,000? You can give more if you wish. You are a very rich person and a barrister of our city. And you always give donation for good work before anyone. First show me your list. Let me see who has given how much. You are asking 5,000 from me. And you've collected 500 - 1000 from others. Who has given this 2,500? - My father. Shivcharan Sharma? - He is my father. That of Indore? - Yes. That engineer? - Yes. Are you his daughter? - Do you know him? l know him before you were born. When did you all come from Indore? - It has been 2 years. You've been here for 2 years, and he didn't even inform me? He didn't tell me for 2 years that he is here. You're his daughter? - Yes. What's your name? - Mira Sharma. Mira! l will collect the donation from your father now. - Yes? Here. l am coming to your house with you. Don't go from here. l'll go change. According to the opinion of the doctors.. ..l had to bring her here urgently. You've done the right thing, Shivcharan. She'll get good treatment here. But l ask you.. ..why didn't you inform me when you knew that l live here? You should have at least told me.. ..that Bhabhi is not well since last 3 years. She has an iniury in the backbone. She can't walk.. Bro, it's my mistake. But believe me, l was too tensed. So much that you couldn't even call up once? Bhabhi, now you decide. Either our friendship will end today.. ..or we'll have a lifelong relation. lt is a matter between you 2 friends. What do l say? Just tell me, have you promised Mira's hand to any one? No. Why? - Then from today Mira is my daughter in law. l hope you don't mind, Shivcharan. Why do you need to ask when you've already decided? That's it. - But the boy should like the girl. Bro, l haven't let my boy be influenced.. ..by the modern lifestyle as much as l could. Yet l'll send him over. So that both can meet each other. Shyam, you're going to England. Let's have a party on this happy occasion. Sure. Who's giving the party? - You. Who else? My dear, you always rob me. You're always looking for an excuse to have a party. This is a good excuse. Bro, going to England is a big deal for us. All right, l'll give a party. But after coming back from England. Now talk about something else. Talk something else? Talk about girls! Talk about love! Shut up, fatty! What do you have to do with girls or love? Has any girl talked to you till now? - That's the bad luck. Whenever l look lovingly at a girl.. ..either she turns away, or starts laughing at me. Hey, leave it. Hey, get up from here. And go to some other table. Why? - Because this is our table. We sit here every day. But we are sitting here today. So you go to the other table. And please, don't bore us. - What did you say? Are you deaf? You, wicked.. - Hey, mister! Aren't you ashamed to hit a girl? Oh! You're a girl? Forgive me, but looking at you getup l thought you were a boy. Baby, you shouldn't mess with such manner less guys. Don't mess, but at least you can hug us. Guru, she seems to be a foreigner. - No. Then she must be one of the Beatles. - No. Then some hippy. - Wrong. Some Shippy. - Wrong again. Then you tell us, guru. - Shall l tell you? Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? Speak. Speak. Speak. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? Cutting the hair short, powdering the cheeks.. ..she has made a mess of a good face. Cutting the hair short, powdering the cheeks.. ..she has made a mess of a good face. Bare hands, bare forehead, kohl in the eyes. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? Speak. Speak. Speak. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? O Lord, this beauty. It is all fake. Whoever marries her, will be unlucky. O Lord, this beauty. It is all fake. Whoever marries her, will be unlucky. lf you want to save yourself, wave them goodbye from far. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? Speak. Speak. Speak. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Woman was considered a goddess in this country some day. Now a 20 year old girl is called a baby! Woman was considered a goddess in this country some day. Now a 20 year old girl is called a baby! What sort of queen is this, who imitates the foreigners? Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? Speak. Speak. Speak. Crazy of fashion. These are Japanese dolls. Who will call her an Indian girl? Forgive me. You might be thinking.. ..that why did l interfere in your matter. No, l was thinking how to thank you. There's nothing to thank for. - There is. lf you hadn't held her hand, she would have slapped Radha. What did you say her name is? - Radha. It's a surprise! - What? My name is Shyam. - Shyam? Yes, what a nice coincidence! Radha, come on. - Yes. Greetings. - Greetings. Guru, are you on the right track? - Shut up, fatty! Guru, my track is too big. Congratulations, Radha. - What for? Radha has found her Shyam. l didn't find the guy so bad. Wow! Good that l found you here, Radha. - Come on, Shanti. Will you go walking when l am here? l've just bought a car today. Come, l'll drop you home. - There's no need. Who is he? He lives in my locality. Always keeps following me. Shyam! - Yes, father. Shivcharan is a very old friend of mine. Go to his home tomorrow. This is his address. Anything special, father? - You'll know when you go there. Bro, did you meet father? - Yes. Did father tell you where you have to go tomorrow? At Mr. Sharma's place. - That's it? Didn't he tell you anything else? No, why? What's the matter after all? The same matter from which no girl or boy has been able to run away. What? - Mr. Sharma has a daughter. Father saw her. And he chose her for you. Do you get it now? Why did father think of that? l have got to go to England yet. Yes, father has decided to set the matter before you go to England. And then the wedding. All right, l'll see the girl. And then tell him that l didn't like her. Don't fool me, bro. You're also exited. Rekha, don't bore me, and go from here. Telling me? - Yes. You? - You? - But how did you come here? Will you believe it? It's written in my Janamkundali. Written what? - That l will see you as a stranger in the 1st meeting. And that as a life partner in the 2nd meeting. - What? Why are you scared? Am l so ugly? What are you saying? Without know who or what l am, you.. Radha, l only know that you are going to be my wife. And l like you very much. But l want to know that, how did you make.. ..a lifelong decision by a meeting of few moments? This is not my decision. It is that of destiny. And this is called luck. - You'll make me go mad. And l've already become one! Only between yesterday and today. l feel like doing something crazy. Radha, madam is calling you. Yes, mother. - Radha, doctor had forgotten a book yesterday. lt's in Mira's room. Go and get it. - Yes. She looks after me so well that even a trained nurse cannot. You've done a good thing by appointing Radha here. She is an educated girl from a humble family. She can live here respectably. And at least she'll be saved.. ..from the tyranny of her stepmother all day. She should marry a good boy and settle down. Madam, l've advised her many a times on that. l'm even ready to find her a boy. But she is crazy. - Why? She says she wouldn't let.. ..the shadow of her bad luck fall on someone else. Radha, a girl's fate is someone else's as soon as she is born. Getting a husband is also written in her fate. And that is called luck. This restlessness is not without any reason! - What? lt is a Sher by Ghalib. And it suits you well. Bro, you didn't report me how my would be sister in law is. But l have understood seeing your plight. You have understood nothing seeing my plight. The one who marries that girl will either be a fool or unlucky. You mean? - l mean she has a face like Papaya. Eyes like radish. Nose like a potato. Cheeks like desert. And don't ask about the complexion. lt is like blackberry. Complete black. - And her voice? Like the one you hear when one breaks a chestnut with teeth! l got it, bro. The one who is described with ..so many fruits after 1st meeting must be full of juice. Must be very sweet, right? - What? Here's her telephone number. - So? What do l do? At least say thank you. - Thank you? - Yes. Looks like it's Radha's voice. - Who are you? - Shyam. Ok, listen. Cancel whatever program you have tomorrow after 8 o'clock. What? - Yes, cancel because we're going on a picnic. Forgive me, but l can't come. - You will surely go. - But.. l'll look after mother. Tomorrow is Sunday. Where's the picnic? Ok, l'll be there. Ok, one more thing. - What? Tea, father. - Keep it there, daughter. Where is Shyam? Bro left early in the morning. - He is a strange boy. Didn't meet me last night. Goes off early this morning. He should inform me whether he went to Shivcharan's house. Whether he liked the girl.. - l had asked as soon as he came. What did he say? - He was praising her so much.. Greetings, mister. - Come, hunter, Banne Khan Bhopali! Where had you been? - Had gone to Bhopal. To hunt. Sit. What did you hunt? Did you hunt many deer? l don't lift my rifle on small animals. l've hunted down such a big cheetah this time.. ..that you'll iump of joy when you see it. How are you Rekha? - l'm fine. Brothers, why have you stopped outside? Come in. Come in. Here. Put it here. Wow, uncle Banne! Wow Banne! It actually is a big cheetah. But why did you bring it here? Bro, if l had left it in the jungle, the vultures would eat it. Wow! You've done a good hunt. l haven't seen such a mischievous cheetah in life. You mean? - Played hide and seek for 3 days with me. The wretched didn't give me time to even eat lime. But l wasn't going to let it go. l saw it the 13th time. And l fired the 13th bullet. And you know the aim of Banne Khan Bhopali. The bullet hit it in the chest. Forgot to play hide and seek. You killed him with one bullet? - Yes, one. Banne Khan, say the truth. - Bro, l shot 5 bullets at it. But why did you bring it to my house? For you. - For me? - Yes. Banne Khan, you must have spend much money after it. Don't talk about money, bro. It is a gift from Banne Khan. lt will stand in a corner and remind you of our friendship. Banne Khan, come, let's have tea. No, no tea. l've shut down my shop and come here. People must be waiting for me. l'll come some other day. Greetings, bro. Come on, guys. Greetings. How are you? Come, Bhabhi. - Greetings, auntie. God bless you! lt is dead. - Oh! It is false? lt's a Jugadari cheetah. Banne Khan has shot him. Whoever might have shot him. It's still a cheetah. How's your health? - l'm alive! Doctors have refused me to eat. So l'm surviving on these gram and Kurmure. Raian was coming this way. l thought l'll go along and meet you. Good. Come, Raian. Sit. Raian, you'll have to handle.. ..the office alone after Shyam goes to England. Will you be able to handle that? Don't worry, uncle. l'll manage everything. lt is a big responsibility.. Let him do it, brother in law. You always consider your sister's son Shyam capable. Actually the brother's son has the 1st right. That's right, Bhabhi. l'm talking about the responsibilities. Not about the distribution of the property. It's early for that. You've taken the matter on wrong track. l don't know how to put forward my thoughts. Then keep quiet, mother. - All right, Rajan. Rekha, where is Shyam? l don't see him. l don't know where he has gone since the morning. Radha! Where are we going this way? To a nice place where there is no crowd. No noise. Only you and me. - You go if you want. Shyam! lt's a nice place, isn't it? There's no crowd, no noise. Only you and me, and this mud. And you look like a lotus in the mud. Don't ioke. - l am telling the truth. Madam, come out now. You've had shower and your clothes are washed, too. First you move from there. - Why? How can l come in front of you in these wet clothes? Ok, you don't come. l'll come in front of you. - No! Were you scared? - Look, don't irritate me. l'm feeling cold. But l have no intention of moving from here. Please, you are under my oath. Now l will have to move. l've gone, madam. You are a strange girl! Is anyone so shy of his own people? Our own ones don't bother us like this. Promise that you won't come up with any new pranks. l won't. First swear on me. - l swear on myself. Not on you, swear on me. One does not swear on those who are lovelier than the moon. So, you don't believe me? Look, Radha, for the 1st time in my life l've loved you. And to make you believe that.. come with me. Come. Look, it's a God's temple. l swear on it and make you mine. Do you believe me now? Go and dry up your clothes or it'll soon be evening. And listen! l've made you mine in front of God. But you also accept me now. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Now we have to fulfill only one dream. l want to give you the Iove of many lives. Since the day l met you, l've started believing in destiny. l wanted to be yours. And l've become yours now. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Don't look at me like this with a smile. l feel shy. lf l control my body, my mind strays off. One receives love for love. Why are you shy of me? Our eyes have signaled to each other. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Your eyes are pretty. Your cheeks are blushing. Your lips are like flowers. l am not content, no matter how long l look at you. Good that l met you. This black hair, these fair body. l've found the support of life. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Whether people believe it or not.. ..the one who was stranger till yesterday.. ..has become dearer than my own life now. ..has become dearer than my own life now. Shanti, l'll take my clothes later. But, Radha, you didn't tell me how your clothes got wet. l'll tell you later. l'm getting late and mother might be upset with me. Here. - What's the need for this, Shankar? My housework is going fine. - This sari has become old. Get a new sari. And you also need uncle's medicines, right? Shankar, all that you've done for this family.. Auntie, l've done it considering it my own. Am l a stranger? Ok, l'll leave. Come again. - Yes. Back from the picnic? Wow! Changed the clothes, too? Who was with you? - Shankar! You don't need to interfere in my matters. Aren't you ashamed? You go to picnic leaving your ill father.. ..at home, saying that you're going for the job? Why are you staring? Every word of mine pinches you like a scorpion. Enough, mother. l got a bit late today. And it'll be too late tomorrow. lf you make some mistake, you'll defame us. - Mother! Radha, go in. - And stay at home from tomorrow. You won't go for the iob now. - Why? Because Shankar doesn't like it. And l've promised Radha's hand to Shankar. Father, l don't like Shankar. l'll kill myself before l marry him. Did you hear that? Send her to college to study. Send her on job. She doesn't respect parents at all. lf she were my daughter, l'd cut her tongue. There's no need to send Radha. Perhaps l'll recover. Perhaps l'll be able to repay Shankar's debt. Father and l had gone to Mr. Sharma's place. - Really? But you hadn't met him. - Why do l need to meet him? Ok, tell me, how did you find your would be sister in law? Would be sister in law? - Yes. Shall l tell you how l found her? - Yes. Very bad! Her face is like Papaya. Eyes like radish. Nose like a potato. And cheeks like desert. l tell you bro, refuse her. Or you'll be trapped. l'm already badly trapped, Rekha. l cannot refuse now. Father has promised Mr. Sharma. And it is my duty to obey father. Shyam! Yes, father. - Here's your plane ticket. You have a flight early next morning. Where were you all day? - l had gone for a picnic with friends. Shivcharan had invited you on dinner. There's no time left now. But call him before you leave. Go and rest now. You've got to wake up early tomorrow. Let him rest now. l'm Shyam. - Yes? l've got the ticket. And l'm leaving for the airport. l'll meet you first of all as soon as l return. Will you wait for me? And listen. l'm sorry for yesterday. l hope you'll forgive me. Doesn't matter. - Shyam, come fast. We're getting late. Ok, l'm going. Mira! What is it, mother? - Whose call was it so early in the morning? Mr. Shukla's son.. - Shyam? He was apologizing for being unable to come to dinner last night. l want to meet him once. - You'll have to wait then. He is going abroad today itself. - Today? Yes, right now. Look, bro, l've never been to London. But l've heard that the English madams keep following you. You save yourself. - Don't worry, uncle Banne. You're very smart. But the thing is that it is only your father whom l call brother. He might forgive you. But you know my anger. Bro, what are you teaching Shyam? Are you teaching him hunting? No, bro. l was telling him about the lifestyle of London. Tell him not to bring along any madam. - l've told him. You've already told him? - Yes. - Come to the airport with us. Wait. l've come leisurely on my cycle. l'll take a shortcut and reach the airport before you. Come, let's have a race. - Yes, you guys sit in. l'm so iealous. And you don't feel anything? - About what? Brother in law sent Shyam abroad. And didn't send you till Jumri Talaiya either. Uncle is the master of his own wish, and also his property. You are the actual heir to that property. You are the son of his own brother. And Shyam is his sister's son. Look, mother, l'm doing an important job. l don't have the time to hear any lecture. You'll do clerical work all your life. And one day brother in law will give away all his property to Shyam. The same matter again? Mother l am so talented that l can put lakhs of rupees at your feet. l'm iust waiting for the right chance. l've become old listening this. ls it done? Here, child. Shall l tell you something? Taking the advantage.. ..of Shyam's absence, butter your uncle a bit. And talk nicely to Rekha sometimes. After all she is your sis. And the dear daughter of brother in law. - She might be. But l want to keep away from such a sis. She goes out of the house saying that she is going for studies. And then flirts around in parks. And that, too, with a 3rd class boy. What are you saying? Such a cold sigh? Why? - l've caught God's mistake today. What? - Why didn't he get us born in a foreign country? Where two love filled hearts don't have to get tortured. We'd have seen each other in the morning.. ..engaged in the afternoon, and wedded at night. And divorced the next day! But we would at least be wedded before the divorce. Rekha, think over my plight. And tell me when, where and how will we get married? My mind has failed thinking over this matter. And now one day my heart will fail, too. Talk to my father before it fails! - The same thing again? Am l going to marry you or your father? You are an idiot! - Every lover is an idiot, Rekha. Hey, Rekha! Rekha, listen to me. - Don't you dare follow me! Rekha, listen.. - Let madam Rekha go, dear. You stand here. Am l sitting? Leave my neck. Who are you? You talk too much, dear. If l had married on the right time.. ..l would be having a worthless child like you now. What do you want? First you tell me your name. - My name is Deepak. lt's a good name. But why are you roaming around Rekha? We study in the same class. What class do you have here in the park? Uncle Banne! - You don't need to say anything, child. l've seen him following you. No, the thing is.. - Is he your uncle? You talk to me, dear. Rekha, child, you go home. Go. l'll go, too! - Where are you going? lf you had a class in the park, Iearn a lesson from me, too. What? - The lesson is that, if l ever see you with Rekha again.. What will you do then? - Don't argue with me. Or your bones will be broken and l'll be in jail for six months. So run away from here. Run. Run! Radha! - Dinu uncle? There's a Ietter for you. For me? - Yes. l was going to the market. l thought l'll give it to you on the way. And why did you stop coming for the job, child? l won't be able to come now, uncle Dinu. Mother doesn't like me doing a iob. Ok, l'll leave now. - Have tea. l'm in a hurry right now. l'll come some other day, child. God bless you. Queen of my heart! l'm going abroad for a few months. Please, don't feel bad about not meeting you before leaving. l'm forced to go so far after being so close to you. Yet you'll always be with me. In my heart, in the hearbeats. Wait for my return. And whenever you remember me, remember that.. ..with our bodies, our souls have also become one. We have become one forever. We'll get married as soon as l return. And then l won't say. Think for yourself. Yours and only yours for many lives, Shyam. Mother? Can you hide your feelings by hiding the photo from your mom? How long will you worship her secretly? Take me to Mira's mother. l'll talk to her. What will you say, mother? There's nothing to talk about. Then why do you keep seeing Mira's photo day and night? Just like that. l like her. She is good, worth having as a daughter in law. Mother, all beautiful dreams don't change to reality. Fearing that l haven't let Mira know till now.. ..that she holds a very special place in my heart. lt's possible that she likes you, too. Have you ever tried to find that out? This is that beautiful dream, mother, with which l amuse myself. Hoping that it will turn true some day. You are crazy. You are supposed to visit Mr. Sharma's place today, right? Yes. - Then talk to Mira's mother today itself. Mother? - Yes, you have my blessings. Come, doctor. Greetings, madam. - Greetings. Have a seat. You look quite well today. - l've improved a lot with your treatment. Madam, l want to say something. l'll surely listen. But have these sweets first. Sweets? What's the occasion? - Mira's marriage is fixed. We've found a decent family. The boy has gone abroad. The marriage will take place as soon as he returns. Congratulations, Mira. Sweeten your mouth. - Yes. Oh yes, you were going to say something, weren't you? Yes. You'll recover fast if you get the operation done. l'll get it done as soon as Mira's wedding is completed. Mr. Mehta, l won't be coming to the office from tomorrow. Why, uncle? - The doctor has told me that l should rest now. And l get tired very soon these days. Send the important office work to me with Rajan. l'll see it. As you say, sir. You shouldn't worry about the office work, uncle. l will take care. You should rest now. l also wish that. Let Shyam come from England. Then you brothers handle the work together. Take this. - Here. How come you're here? - You like Hotel Evening Star, don't you? You mean? - It is mortgaged with me for 1 lakh rupees. Here's that agreement. It owner died the day before yesterday. l changed the document. - What benefit do l get in it? A 60 - 40 partnership. 60 mine and 40 yours. But, pal, take care of one thing. - Which one? You've come to this office today. But never come again. Uncle is a very strict person. lf he sees you in the office, l'll be in the same plight as you are. l'll be bald! Show me what it is. Looks like you didn't find any work today also. Did you go at Dr. Kailash's place? - How could l go there, mom? l had to leave the iob he gave me because of you. But l had also told you to marry Shankar. l've already given the answer to that. That's why Shankar has stopped giving money. We haven't bought your father's medicines for 2 days. And we also have to pay the rent the day after tomorrow. But what do l do, mother? - Accept the proposal, Radha. l'll convince Shankar. - No, mother. It is impossible. Rascal! Shameless, scoundrel! Whose sin are you carrying? Speak up! Answer! With whom did you sleep? Speak up. Mother! - Don't you dare call me mother! Are you listening? There's good news for you. You're going to be a grandpa! What? - Ask your dear. Now l understand why she is refusing to marry. lt's fine. Why bother about marriage.. ..when you can have everything without it? Radha? Forgive me, father. - Go away from here. Destiny had destroyed everything of mine. l only had prestige left. You've ruined it, too. Get up. You are dead for us now. We have no relation with you from today. Get out from here. l say get out! Get out of here. - No, mother. Where will l go? Are you sure he won't cheat you? Yes, Shanti. He has promised me. Men always promise, but are unable to fulfill that. Specially that promise which is called.. ..a man's mistake and a woman's sin in our society. l've fallen from the eyes of my parents today. And tomorrow you'll from the eyes of the world. Shanti, l've come as a helpless to you. Tell me what do l do now. Where do l go? Will you listen to my advice? Go to Dr. Kailash immediately. Only he can free you from this sin. This would be better for you. Doctor! - Radha? At this hour? What's the matter? You give life to everyone, don't you? Give me death! - What? Give me some medicine that might sleep me forever. Here, drink it. You'll feel pain, only for 5 minutes. Why don't you drink? You want death, don't you? lt is easy to say, Radha. But it's not easy to die. l can't tell you about my helplessness, doctor. You don't need to say either, Radha. l am a doctor. lt is no surprise for me that an unmarried girl is going to be a mother. You've already made a mistake. And now you want to commit this crime? - What? lsn't it a sin to play with your and that child's life? But, doctor, it is also a sin to give birth.. ..to the child who is a sign of its mother's mistake. Radha, only God is the master of life and death. Come. Come with me. She is my mother. Not only mine, but also of all these kids. Radha, try and be a mother of one such child. And then decide whether they have a right to live or not. Enough, doctor! Forgive me. On one condition. Till you are helpless, you won't go from here. You'll live with mother. Radha, how old are you? 22 years. A life which took 22 years to be build, is very precious. lt is a big crime to try and crush it in a moment. Remember this. Rekha! - Do you have a sore throat? l had. But it's ok now that l've met you. lt's ok. You are calling my name so loudly! What will others think if they hear that? lf he's a smart person.. ..he'll understand that l am following uncle Majnu. He used to call Laila. And l am calling Rekha! Don't blabber! l'm tired of you. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. ..l've forgotten to eat, drink or sleep. l was a useful man. Now l'm worthless. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. ..l've forgotten to eat, drink or sleep. l was a useful man. Now l'm worthless. Since the day l gave you my heart, l've made you my killer. Since the day l gave you my heart, l've made you my killer. You make me restless day and night. You make me go crazy. l'll also have a chance to take revenge one day. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. ..l've forgotten to eat, drink or sleep. l was a useful man. Now l'm worthless. This love is quite expensive. l'm waiting for marriage. This love is quite expensive. l'm waiting for marriage. l have faith in God. l've though over. l'll get the fruits of my hard work. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. ..l've forgotten to eat, drink or sleep. l was a useful man. Now l'm worthless. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. Rekha, O Rekha! Since the day l've seen you.. ..l've forgotten to eat, drink or sleep. l was a useful man. Now l'm worthless. Master, does a lion die with one bullet? Forget the lion. And fix this puncture. Shut up! l'm not a coward like you. Master, will you take me with you this time to hunt a lion? Dear bro, the thing is that when a lion roars.. ..in the iungle, even the bravest of all is scared stiff. See? You're scared at hearing the name. Come on. Blow the air. Uncle Banne! - Rekha! How come you're here at the shop? There's a telegram from bro. He's coming back from England. l thought l would inform you. - Good. How's your father? - He's fine. So, dear, do you also whistle like this looking at your sister? ln which school is it taught to whistle when you see a girl? Forgive me. l won't do this mistake again. Look, you seem to be from a good family. Learn good things. Rekha, go home. Give my regards to your father. And tell him that l'll reach at the airport. Go now. Brother! Mister Shyam! Thank you very much, bro.. ..that you didn't forget your sis after going abroad. But, bro, 2 dresses of the same color? One is for you. And the 2nd? - For someone else. l know. That means for the one who is going to be.. Come, have food. - l'll have it later. l wasn't able to meet Mr. Sharma before going abroad. And father was very upset with that. l think l should go and meet him. - Only Mr. Sharma? You mean? - You've iust returned from the airport. And you want to go to your matrimonial house so soon? The meaning is clear. - Silly, these are just formalities. l'll be right back. - The truth is that, you came and you're going. Bro, you forgot this gift. lt is nice. Master, Mr. Shyam has come. Shyam! Greetings. - God bless you. l apologize, son. l couldn't come to receive you.. ..at the airport as Mira's mother was not feeling well. Mira! Mira, child. Shyam has come. Why are you so shy? He is Shyam. Shyam, the doctor has come. l'll go and meet him. You both sit and talk to each other. ls your name Mira? Yes. Do you have a sis? No. Why? - No, l was asking just.. Shyam! Mira's mother is eager to meet you. Mira, didn't you offer any tea to Shyam? Go and make a 1st class hot tea for Shyam. Come, child. Mira's mother, Shyam has come. - Greetings. God bless you, child. Doctor, he is Shyam. Glad to meet you. Ok, madam, l'll Ieave now. Greetings, Mr. Sharma. Sit, child. - No, mother. l'll take your leave. - Why? l've come directly from the airport to meet you all. l'll come some other day. - Child, this is your house. Yes. Greetings. What a nice boy! - And shy, too. Listen! Are you leaving? Wouldn't you have tea? - No. Yes, Radha was a servant here. Do you know where she lives? ln the Jawahar Nagar, near the post office. Listen! Do you live in this area? - Yes, why? l'm looking for a girl. Perhaps you might be knowing her. What's her name? - Her name is Radha. Shankar, note the name he said. You were already one. Now we've found another lover of Radha. What? - This is nothing. Don't know how many more lovers we'll find of Radha. What rubbish are you talking? A girl named Radha lived in this locality. She's run away after losing her prestige and defaming this locality. Shut up! l only asked you the address of Radha. You could have asked anyone the address of that wicked. Go straight. Turn left. It is the 1st building, on the ground floor. Looks like he's deeply hurt. Come on, guru. We're getting Iate. Start the car. Don't defame yourself.. ..by saying the name of that immoral girl. You seem to be from a decent family. Don't know how many boys' lives that witch has ruined. But you must have asked whose child she was carrying. Whose child? Tell me, is the water of this glass from a tap, a river or a well? What? - An immoral girl doesn't have only one lover. Do you know what a girl.. ..who is going to be a mother without marriage is called? Degraded! Can a prostitute tell whose child is she carrying? You are saying such bad things despite being her mother? Don't ever come here again. Are you ready, Syam? Why is it dark? You're not ready yet? Father, l.. l have a headache. l won't go, father. You're giving an excuse. What will l say to Shivcharan.. ..if you don't attend your own engagement party? What happened? - l don't want to get married so soon, father. Why don't you want to marry? l want to help you with the business first, and get settled. You can do that after marriage, too. ln fact, a person settles down only after marriage. And don't forget, Shyam, that l've promised Shivcharan. And you also like the girl, don't you? - Yes, father. Get ready then. l'll be waiting for you. Don't be so annoying, bro. Get ready fast. We're getting late. Have sweets, dear. Yes, Bhabhi have it. - No, you take first. Shivcharan, you're free now. - How's that? Your responsibilities will be over.. ..as soon as Mira's marriage is completed. Responsibilities never end. She is to be operated as soon as we do Mira's marriage. l want Mira's wedding to be done as soon as possible. Why wait then? l also want to get her married as soon as Shyam's marriage is done. Father! Bhabhi, there's some magic about you. Bro was having a headache. Now he's ok after seeing you. Will you have coffee? And you, bro? - No, Rekha. Please, have some. - No. l want to ask you something. l wanted to ask yesterday. But you left soon. We both are educated. And we are brought up in this new era. What do you want to say? That l'm an Indian girl. l can't go against my parents' wish. You are a man. There are no restrictions for you. l don't get you. This party today is a lifelong decision for you and me. lf you love someone else, iust say yes. l'll refuse the marriage. You'll be freed. Shankar, note the name he said. An immoral girl doesn't have only one lover. Do you know what a girl.. ..who is going to be a mother without marriage is called? Degraded! A girl named Radha lived in this locality. She's run away after losing her prestige and defaming this locality. And you also like the girl, don't you? You didn't answer me. Believe me, l want to be your wife, not a burden on you. You've got me wrong. - l felt as if you didn't want to marry. Yes, l didn't want to marry. Because l didn't know you. But suddenly in these few moments l've known you well. Don't ever let this thought pass your mind.. ..that there can a place for anyone except you in my heart. ls he sleeping? - Yes, he went to sleep just now. What will you name him? - Haven't thought yet. lt is the father who usually names a child. Radha, l haven't asked you anything till now. Today l only want to ask that.. ..will his father back off from accepting you? l fully trust him. But he has gone out of India. l only want you to marry him and live a respectable life. And yes, it's Mira's wedding today. l forgot to tell you. l got the invitation card this morning. Ok, l'll leave now. You're going to attend the wedding, right? - Yes. l can't give Mira anything right now. But say congratulations on my behalf. - Sure. Shyam? Mira? No, l can't believe this. This is not possible. Not at all. l won't let this marriage take place. l'll never let it take place! Drive fast, brother. Drive faster! l have to reach there quickly. Reach me there quickly, bro. Drive faster. May God give everyone a daughter like you! Just remember this advice of your mother. Husband is God! Accept his faults and cover them. lt is a woman's religion and duty. Come, child. Everyone's waiting. Be happy, child. Take care of mother, uncle Dinu. Uncle Dinu, whose child is this? Many people have come to the marriage. Must be of one of them. Sister, what was mine till yesterday is yours now. Your husband Shyam.. ..had accepted me as his wife in front of God. And this child is the sign of that. l don't know for which mistake of mine is Shyam punishing me. lf l could reach before the marriage circles.. ..l would have never let this marriage take place. But my life was to be ruined. And it is ruined. May God always keep you happy! When you might be reading this letter.. ..l would be far away from your life. This is a request from an unlucky woman. Accept this child and get him his right. Because your husband is his father. l have only one proof to make you believe me. Shyam's letter, which he had written to me from England. l am writing this letter at the back of that letter. Banne Khan! - Yes, bro. The marriage procession is going to leave from here soon. Someone should stay there to receive the groom and the bride. l'll go then. l'll keep the garlands and other things ready. You bring along the groom and the bride. l was iust going to say that. Take my car. Bro, the car gets trapped in the traffic. A cycle comes in handy while in hurry. Just paddle it and you reach where you want. l'll go through the shortcut. Here, bro, take the ioker. - Forget the joker. Look at that queen. Who are you? Let go of me. l say leave me. What will we do if we leave you? - l will tell you what to do. First you leave this girl. - Move forward. Look, mister, if l move forward.. ..you'll find your teeth broken in your hands. ls it? Here, take care of the queen. Misters, you are acting smart. Save yourself, or you'll get smashed. l redden my mouth with a Paan. And that of others with a slap. O Lord! Scared so soon? Did you see that Bhopali trick? Run away! You are strange, child! Is this the time to go out at night? Thank God that l came over. Come, l'll drop you home. Thank you very much. l'll go by myself. Don't act childish. l'm bringing the cycle. Sit on the carrier. l'll drop you home. Till now Mira was crazy of Shyam. But from today Shyam is a devotee of Mira. You're comparing me with that goddess? You're no less than a goddess. l had understood it in a single meeting. Your beauty is as clear and pure as your name. Come. Let me add 4 stars to your beauty. This is a gift from my late mother. lt was her last wish that her daughter in law wears this. Before accepting mother's gift, l want to tell you something. Yes, tell me. First promise me that.. ..even if you find my words unpleasant you'll forgive me. l promise you and l forgive you. Think well. It's easy to promise. But as much difficult to fulfill. Try me. Just say what you want. l'll listen with a smile and forgive with a laugh. l.. l am a mother of a child! - What? l am a mother of a child. lf you hadn't promised to forgive me, l wouldn't have said this. Keep quiet! - You said just now that.. ..you'll listen with a smile and forgive with a laugh. l'll be ruined if you break your promise. Please, save my prestige. Accept this child and give him a father's love and a child's right. A father's love? Go away from here. Bro, father is not feeling well suddenly. Come fast. Where's she? - Who she? Bhabhi? She's with father. Enough, Shyam! Look at me, too! l'm not well. How are you now, father? l'm fine but this doctor says that l'm not well. You shouldn't take it as a joke. You need rest. What else am l doing? - Look, child, don't let him get out of bed. How many restrictions will you lay on me? You stopped my practicing. You stopped me from going to the office. You don't need to work while Shyam is here. You need rest. Take this doctor from here. - l'll come back at 3 o'clock to see you. Why are you after me? Go! Come, daughter in law. Sit. l'll bring iuice for you. - Wait! There's no need for the juice. Can you bring milk with almonds? Then l don't need it. Give it to Shyam. Look, child, grief isn't lessened by crying. You've been crying a lot. Why did you save me? l wanted to die. l am a criminal. How can l believe that? You told me your name is Radha. A person with such a name cannot commit any crime. Yes, the day Radha commits a crime, the whole world will be a criminal. l want to go from here now. - But first tell me where will you go. l don't know myself. - Then stay here. l don't have a sister. You be my sister. Let me be your bro. l swear on God l won't let you complain. l will give my life for you if needed. Test me. Brother! - Child, l had been wanting a sis since childhood. But fate didn't give me one. Now God has given me. You are a guardian of all. l've heard a lot about you. You are a guardian of all. l've heard a lot about you. But l'll believe you only when you solve my problem, Shyam. You are a guardian of all. Listen to my request. Just do me this favor. Return the person from whom you've seized his right. To save the dignity of my promise.. ..is your duty now. You are a guardian of all. l've heard a lot about you. Those who come to your refuge meet success in life. l'm unlucky even after getting married. What is my mistake? O Lord of the world, O God, l bow down to you. You are a guardian of all. l've heard a lot about you. But l'll believe you only when you solve my problem, Shyam. When you solve my problem, Shyam. You are a guardian of all. Father? God bless you, child. - Father, the doctor has told you to stay in bed. Please, rest. - l was resting. Listening to the Aarti after so many days, l remembered my sister. She also used to do the Aarti here. Subhadra, she was my only sis. She and her husband were killed in a motor accident. Shyam was 6 years old at that time. Child, l haven't let him feel that lack of anything till now. lf you have any problem, you can also tell me. Father! - What is it, child? Why these tears in your eyes? Father, l'm in a dilemma. That's what l want to ask you, child. What's the dilemma? Father, l had a friend. She married last year. And her husband left her within 6 months. She couldn't bear the shock. She died leaving with me an 8 days old child. Father, l don't understand what should l do? Where's that child? - With my mother. And she's going out of town for her operation. Have you thought what you want to do? Yes, l think l will send him to the orphanage. Orphanage? Your friend could have done that if she wished. But your friend trusted you.. ..that's why she handed over the child to you, right? Yes, father. - What's the confusion then? Bring the child here. Here? - Yes, your confusion will be solved. And l'll also have a good time. This is better, daughter. Bring the child here. Strange! People think of going home early after marriage. And you're still here? Go, bro. Bhabhi must be waiting for you. Shut up, Raian! - Why? Did l say anything wrong? l'm not in the mood for a iest. Tell me if you have some work. The thing is that the staff wants a party for your marriage. There's no need for a party. Sorry, Raian. l'm very tensed at the moment. Please, go. How are you feeling now, father? l wasn't well, but now l'm fine. See. Daughter in law has brought me a nice toy to play with. Whose' that child? - It is daughter in law's friend's orphan child. Father, l want to tell you something. What is it? Why are you upset? Take the call. Shyam? Look, child, l've taken the cardiogram of your father today. The condition of his heart is not ok. - What? His condition is not ok? There's nothing to worry. He only needs a lot of rest. Yes. Ok. All right. Whose call was it? - Doctor's. l know he must have said that l need rest. - Yes. Shyam, l have nothing else to do except rest now. All my worries are gone after daughter in law has arrived. l wish God gives such a nice daughter in law to every one. What were you saying at that time? - Nothing, father. l forgot. So it wasn't something important. - Yes, father. Then go and change. Daughter in law is waiting for you. Dear, don't know whose child you are. But l've become your grandpa! How dare you bring that child in this house? l was forced by my maternal love. l couldn't live without the child. lf you weren't ashamed of telling me.. ..why did you hide the reality from father? He is a father. And you are my husband. lt is my duty to respect father. Duty? Teach me this nice drama, too. So that l can also play the role of your husband forever. lt would be better if you forgive me. l am ready to repent the way you ask. Go and drown yourself. And also take that child along. He cannot live here. - He will stay here. l've taken the permission of father. Father treats you like a goddess. l could have shown your real self to him. But l'm helpless. He cannot bear such a big shock. And you want to take the advantage of his helplessness. No. l only want to ask that, who does not make mistakes? lf you had done a mistake.. - Mira! What is that child's fault? lt's not written on his fate who his father is. You can consider him your own if you wish. lt is impossible! Child, come out. Here. - What is it? - These are saris. You don't ask anything by yourself. So l brought them. But why did you bring them? You can do with old, dirty clothes. But people will blame me. Yes, child. People will say that .. ..hunter Banne Khlt is the iniustice of naturean Bhopali is a scoundrel. Doesn't care for his sister. How many more favors will you to do me, bro? How long will l be a burden on you? You are mocking the relation between a sister and a brother. Are you embarrassing me? - It's not that, bro. l mean, what else have l done except resting after l came here? You've done wonders! You've turned this shed into a house. l don't see any cobwebs. Mosquitoes have run off besides the bugs. Joseph! - Yes, master. Was a stove burnt in this house before madam's arrival? Only the rats ran here and there, master. - See? l forgot the rats. Bro, will you accept my request? - Just tell me. l want to do a iob. How did you think of that? Why would you work? l am bored at home. l don't have anywhere to go. l don't have a friend either. As it is all the girls work nowadays, bro. lf l work, l'll feel better. - You are right. Shall l start looking for a job from tomorrow then? Why should you look? l'll get a job for you. - You? Just see, child. l deal in cycles. But l have friends who own motors. l'll take you tomorrow morning. Come on. Get me tea. - l'll get it right away. Come. - Why did you bring me here, bro? My friend lives here. Come in. Come. Don't cry. Drink milk. - Greetings, bro. Come, Banne Khan. Look what a trouble l am in. What is this, bro? - Grandchild. What are you saying? Our daughter in law arrived in this house just a few days back. Where did this child come from? - It's not my grandchild. lt is daughter in law's friend's orphan child. l've made him my grandchild. Here. He's gone to sleep. lt is the iniustice of nature. lt has given bottle to such a little child. That's the sad thing, Banne Khan. Give him to me. l'll drink the milk to him. Be careful. Here. Who is this girl with you? - Radha? She is my sister. Your sis? - Yes, bro. Just the way you made him your grandchild, l made her my sis. She is well educated. She was going to commit suicide tired of her step mother. l brought her to my house. Have l done the right thing? You've done a very good thing. Come. Sit. This is great, Banne Khan. l have a grandchild. You have a sister. But the thing is, bro, that l have a problem now? What problem? - She says she is bored at home. She wants to work. Convinced by her, l agreed to that last night. So l've brought her here to you. But now l feel ashamed. Ashamed for what? - You are strange. Would a sister work as Iong as bro is alive? lsn't it shameful? You considered her sister and gave her a place to live. Now if she wants to work for amusement, what's wrong with that? You've relieved me, bro. Now do me one more favor. Tell me. - Get my sister a job somewhere. Why somewhere else? l'll give her a job in my own office. You said she's educated, right? - Yes. Then send her to my office. l'll talk to Shyam about her. Did you hear that, child? The arrangement for your amusement is done. You've got a iob in brother's office. Yes, come. Lay him in the pram. Here, bro. The bottle's empty. Did you give him all the milk? - Yes, he's also asleep. She's done wonders! She made him sleep like a mother does to her child. After all, it's girls who become mothers. - That's true, bro. You? l'd thought l would find you here. But l didn't expect you to recognize me. Congratulations for your marriage. Radha, l don't want to see your face. But now that you've suddenly come here.. ..tell me why did you cheat me? Why were you disloyal to me? Very good! You ruined my life. And now you are accusing me of disloyalty? Don't try to fool me, Radha. As soon as l came from England, l looked for you. Whatever l heard about you from Shankar and then your mother. You believed it! And forgot the one who had trusted and surrendered to you. You went away after amusing yourself for sometime. And l was unable to face the world. l was going to be the mother of your child. Don't try to accuse me for someone else's mistake, Radha. Accuse you? And what if l prove that that child is yours? Where is that child? - Will you give him his rights? Will you be able to accept in front of everyone .. .. that it is your child? Why are you quiet? Answer me. Mr. Shyam, forget your child just as you forgot me. lt wasn't your fault. It was mine. l've got the punishment. Only God knows whether it is you or me who got the punishment. l couldn't forget my child. l found the excuse of a iob to go out of the house. But look at my misfortune, Shanti. Brother Banne took me to the house of the same person.. ..who ruined my life and forced my child to live like an orphan. Now tell me, how can l work in that office? What will you answer bro Banne if you don't work in that office? l don't understand anything. How much more will l pay for a single mistake? All problems would have been solved if l had died. Silly, what do you have to do with Shyam now? l think God has sent you purposely.. ..to that office after listening to your maternal call. Either with bro Banne.. ..or through office, you can see your child and take care of him. You are alive for that. Start going to the office from tomorrow. And if Shyam ever tries to fall for you again.. ..remember that he is Mira's husband now. l'm already blemished. But l'm not so low.. ..that l'd have an affair with the husband of that goddess.. ..to whom me and my child are indebted for life. l know that, Radha. Darling Rekha, l haven't seen you since yesterday. What's your good name? - Who are you? l am Rekha's Bhabhi. - Bh.. Bhabhi, greetings. l am Deepak. - How do you know Rekha? We're in the same college and the same class. Keep speaking. - Keep speaking? Ok, l will. Bhabhi, Rekha and me, me and Rekha.. we both.. Hasn't Rekha told you anything about me? No, have you told anything about Rekha to your parents? No, not yet. But they understood everything. How's that? - l don't feel much hungry. l can't sleep at nights. l can't concentrate on studies. When we asked the doctor.. ..he said he doesn't know what's wrong with me. l got it. There's only one cure for your ailment. Bring your parents to our home. Thank you. The day l meet you, l'll bow down my head at your feet. Here, talk to Rekha. - Who is it? - Some guy called Deepak. Why did you need to call here? Yes, l'll return your book tomorrow. Which book? What book? Don't call here again. He's such a bore! He studies with me. Rekha, you shouldn't call one a bore.. ..with whom you're going to spend all your life. What? - Deepak has told me everything. Do you like him? Look, you shouldn't hide anything from Bhabhi. After all it's me who'll convince father. Bhabhi, where's uncle? l've some important work with him. He's gone to the court. Well, doesn't matter. l'll come back in the evening. Wow, Bhabhi! That's good. - It's my notebook. You write poems? Well, l.. iust iot down a few lines. Give it to me. Now l'll return it only after reading. - But.. l'm coming back in the evening. l'll return it then. l'll leave now. Greetings. Have you answered the letter from income tax department? - Yes. Have the notices arrived from the court? - No. Radha, it has been quite some time since you joined here. But l haven't heard anything except Yes and No from you. Have you vowed to keep quiet? - No. Then say something. Talk to me. You'll be relieved. How can one be relieved to whom life itself is a burden? Radha, you think there's no grief in my life? There shouldn't be. What do you lack? You have wealth, prestige and fame. And a wife like a goddess. A wife like a goddess? Bhabhi! Bhabhi! Are you Rekha's Bhabhi? - Yes. Hadn't l told you on the phone that.. ..when l'll meet you, l'll bow down to you? Like this. You're Deepak, aren't you? - Yes, l'm Deepak. But Rekha had said that you were going to come with your parents. Yes, l've come. l mean l've brought them with me. But l've left them outside. - But why? Because if you don't like me,.. .. l'd be insulted in front of my parents. l see. Come. l'll call them in. - Yes, come. Come in. Father, they are Deepak's parents. - Sit. Sit down, Deepak. Daughter in law, bring Rekha here. Do you own some business? - Yes, with your grace l own a small clothes shop. What are you saying, father? - It's a shop measuring 100 x 60. lt has 6 doors and is filled with goods. , Silk, Suti, woolen, Khadi terrylene, terry coat.. ..there are many goods worth lakhs. Deepak, keep quiet! l won't speak now, father. You tell the matter now. The thing is, Mr. Sharma, that we've seen Rekha. We like her. Now if Rekha and Deepak get married, it will be our good luck. Mine, too. l mean ours. Come, child. Sit. Look, Mr. Devidayal.. ..when the boy and the girl have chosen each other.. ..they must have already decided for marriage. We are only supposed to agree to that. Here, sweeten your mouth for that. Yes, child, take one. Have it. - You have, too. - Yes. Hey, you haven't gone yet? - l had some important letters to type. Then type one letter for me, too. Tell me what you want to write. Write, my sweetheart. You can write darling if you like that. Mr. Raian! - l'm telling the truth, Radha. Since the day you ioined this office, l've given you many hints. But you've never answered to any. Look, l don't like such conversation. Why? Do you have any boyFriend? l don't forget so easily, Radha. l'll remember this slap. And also remember that my bro's name is Banne Khan. Hunter Banne Khan Bhopali! Hey, bro! Greetings. - Greetings. What brings you here? - l've come to invite you. - For what? Tomorrow is the child's birthday. You have to come. l'll surely come. - And also bring Radha with you. You don't need to say that. My sis will come with me on every happy occasion. Ok, l'll leave. - How can you? Have tea first. l've very little time. l've got to go to many places to invite. That's not possible, bro. l won't Iet you go without having tea. Ok, come. - Bro, bring tea fast. Come, bro. Sit. Come, Kailash. Come, doctor. Bro, he's doctor Kailash. Congratulations, Mira. Wow! What a lovely child! Give. You've done a good thing by supporting him. Mother, looks like Dr. Kailash and Mira know .. .. each other quite well. Congratulations, daughter in law. May God give us the chance to truly congratulate you! Yes, daughter in law, he is a stranger after all. Why stranger? He is also our own. Don't feel like letting him go, Mira. But my patients must be waiting for me. l'll have to go. At least have some sweets before you leave. Yes, l'll have to sweeten my mouth. Be careful, Deepak. What's this big thing you've brought? For your child. - Yes, l know. Hey, what are you doing? Forgive me. - Where's your father? - He's gone. - Where? To home. Did you think something else? He'll be here soon. Here, take this in. - Yes. Where did this wall come from? Rekha, congratulations on your nephew's birthday. And may we engage soon! - Keep quiet. Come. Congratulations, Bhabhi. l searched the whole market before getting this gift. The child will play.. but he is too young. Ok, you play with it. Come, Radha. - Congratulations on the birthday. But what took you so long? The thing is, bro, that Rekha told me something. - What? She said that it's the child's birthday. And there must be some singing and dancing. l liked the idea. So l brought them along. Come, brothers. You go in. l didn't recognize them. - This is Nazakat Ali. He is Sharafat Ali. They're very mischievous. Will you sing? - Yes, sir. We'll sing praises for the child. Not now! - Come in. Bring the child here. Kids, come this way. Come here. Blow the candles. Clap! Shut up! If you sing like this, you'll embarrass me. Looks like you had come from sheet. What did you say your name is? - Sharafat and Nazakat. Forgive me, but your parents have made a mistake. Your voice neither has sincerity nor delicacy. Move back. l'll sing myself. - Banne Khan, do you also sing? Bro, you haven't yet seen this side of me. Have you heard the name of Shakila Bano Bhopali? - Yes. She's my disciple! - Really? l taught her to sing since her childhood. She moved ahead in life. So l backed off. Come on. Back off! Come, let's see this side of yours. l'll sing such a song, that the party will keep clapping. Or l'll change my name Banne Khan Bhopali. - Wow!

Do you expect me to sit there to be insulted? What happened? - That what you wanted. l had to welcome everyone to hide your sin. And had to accept congratulations.. ..for the child of don't know which scoundrel. ls anything left to revenge now? - No, it's not what you think. Then what was the need to celebrate the birthday of that child? Father considers him his grandchild. He gave the party. What is my fault? - It's not your fault. It's mine. l couldn't be the father of my wife's child. Go away from here. Go! Sir's calling you. You? - Yes, me. Shyam won't come today. The door's closed and the office is sound proof. Neither can you go out nor your voice. Are you out of your senses? - You've made me go crazy. l'll revenge for my insult today. - Leave me you scoundrel! l never let go of 2 things. Money and woman! You touched me with your lips after all. But why only my writst? Stop! l said stop there. Scoundrel! Shame less! Mr. Raian! Mr. Raian! Leave her. You should be ashamed. Come, child. Come out. Don't be scared. What are you thinking, Mr. Mehta? Call up sir. Wipe off your tears, child. That rascal Raian has tried to defame you. l'll kill him. Come. Come with me. Mr. Mehta, what's the problem? Why did you call me? A terrible thing has happened. Mr. Rajan.. Raian what? - Mr. Raian.. - Speak up! What did Rajan do? Come here. l'll tell you. So, mister, where are you going? Take the prize for your filthy behavior. Listen, Banne Khan. - What should l listen? See for yourself. l had sent my sis to work. Not to be raped. l'll kill him. - l feel sorry for what has happened. l apologize on his behalf. - Uncle, you are apologizing to him? The one who insulted me in front of every one? This goon? - You are a goon. And also a scoundrel. Go away from here. Go. - All right, l'll go. But l'll remember this insult, uncle. Come in both of you. - No, bro. We will go home now. Come, child. May that Banne Khan be ruined! How badly he has hit my child! Enough, mother. l say, why did brother in law keep quiet when you got beaten? He was watching the show, mother! And when l asked him to do justice he slapped me.. ..in front of everyone, and got me out of the office. May his office burn down! How could he behave this way with his own nephew? l will surely revenge for your insult from brother in law. Don't you worry, mother! l'll take the revenge. Such a revenge that.. ..uncle and Shyam will not be in a state to face the world. So Raian told you that the child Mira.. ..has brought here is not her friend's but her own? - Yes. l know why Raian told such a thing. Now l want to know that how could you believe him? lt is a matter of marriage.. Yes, l know it is a matter of marriage. And you should ask this question. Now you can break this relation if you want. - What? Look, Mr. Devidayal, l don't want my daughter.. ..to be married in a family where people believe in gossips. Don't feel bad. After all Rajan is your relative. Whatever he told us, we've told you. Forgive us, Mr. Shukla. - You know Mira well. Only the lucky ones get such a daughter in law nowadays. lt was she who arranged the marriage of Deepak and Rekha. Yet if you are hesitant.. - What are you saying, Mr. Shukla? We only have to fix the date for engagement now. Shall we leave now? Greetings. - Greetings. - Come. Stop! Please, stop for God's sake. This child cannot live in this house now. What happened to the child, Shyam? Where are you taking him? Why don't you answer? - l'm going to admit him to an orphanage. Orphanage? Why? Rekha's engagement was going to end today because of him. That's why you're taking him to an orphanage? lf people are stupid, it's not this child's fault. People bring up the kids of even cats and dogs. This is the child of a human. Daughter in law, take him in. Father, we haven't started an orphanage in this house. When l adopted you, this house wasn't an orphanage. At least you shouldn't talk such things.. Thank you, father. l had forgotten that l am an orphan. Good that you reminded me. What happened to Shyam? Why does he mind this child living here? Take him up. Can l come in, brother? Come in, Banne Khan? Why did you stop there? l hit Raian in your office. l am embarrassed for that. l've come to apologize. But what could l do, bro?" It was a question of my sister's dignity. l couldn't control myself. l understand, Banne Khan. l, too, said such a thing today. l couldn't control myself either. - What happened, brother? l said something to Shyam which l shouldn't have said. He's upset now and gone out. You're tensed for such a small matter? l'll go and call him right now. You.. - But first tell me that you've forgiven me. There's nothing to forgive for. Can a friend like you make a mistake? You've made your friend your slave by saying this. Not a slave, Banne Khan. You're my friend. Leave me, bro. l'll go and bring him right now. l want to say something. l can't see anyone sad. l quench the thirst of eyes with my eyes. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. l'm the cure to all the grief of the world. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. l'm the cure to all the grief of the world. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. l'm the cure to all the grief of the world. Dear, look at me. Don't be shy in this party. l know what's in your heart. Enjoy the drink and the life. Dear, look at me. Don't be shy in this party. l know what's in your heart. Enjoy the drink and the life. Those who are depressed have no one of their own. l make them mine. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. l'm the cure to all the grief of the world. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. l'm the cure to all the grief of the world. Your face is sad. There's sorrow in your eyes. What's happened to you? Smile a bit. Forget what has happened. Your face is sad. There's sorrow in your eyes. What's happened to you? Smile a bit. Whether it's the thirst of sad eyes, or some fire in the heart. l quench both. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. l'm the cure to all the grief of the world. l'm not liquor. Yet l'm intoxication. I'm the cure to all the grief of the world. l don't have cash. Take this necklace. Take off your hand! How much is the bill? Here, take this. Uncle Banne! Greetings. My dear, you were trading daughter in law's necklace for liquor. Daughter in law? Whose? That of father? He takes her to be a goddess. And because of whom l had to leave the house today. Only l know the real face of that goddess, uncle Banne. That child is not of her friend. But her own! Shame on you! You're out of your senses. lf you drink filthy things, you'll have only filthy thoughts. Uncle Banne, l'm a human being. Not a saint. l cannot accept someone else's child as mine. Look, son, the liquor has totally disillusioned you. Now come with me or l'll slap you. And you'll come back to your senses. Come on now. Father, are you all right? l'm fine, child. What is it? Father, l've sent the invitation of Rekha's engagement to all. Good. Have you sent at Bhabhi's place, too? - Yes. l didn't want Raian to step in this house again. l still feel embarrassed in front of Banne Khan.. ..for what Raian did in the office that day. Do you know what Raian told about you to Deepak's parents? l can't tell you what he said. - Whatever it might be, father. This is the occasion of Rekha's engagement. What will people say if we don't invite our close relatives? Please forget whatever Raian has done. Forgive him. You really are a goddess, daughter in law. You've done the right thing. Come, uncle Banne. How are you? - How are you, son? Greetings, brother. - Come, dear. Congratulations for Rekha's engagement. - Same to you. Why didn't you bring Radha along? l had gone out on some work. l had told her to come by herself. She must be coming. Come l'll introduce you to Deepak's parents. Yes, let me meet them. Come. Come in, Raian. Why are you standing out? l've iust brought a gift. - Rekha is in. Come in and give her. Not for Rekha, it's for you. - For me? You'll be pleased to see the gift. Come with me. This is my gift. - Whose letter is it? - Read it for youself. Raian, this is my Iast letter to you. Since the day l told you that l'm going to be.. ..your child's mother, you've turned away from me. Only then could l understand your real self. l wish l had realized your deceit that day.. ..when you secretly married me in a temple.. ..so that there would be no proof of our marriage. Well, leaving behind my mistake and your deceit.. ..l'm starting a new life by being.. ..the daughter in law of a rich family. l have nothing to do with you now. Don't try to look for me. Mira. lt is your wife's letter. Don't you recognize her writing? The destiny sometimes plays dangerous jokes. When you got married, l was shocked. But l kept quiet because it was a question of our family's dignity. But today l want to revenge for my insult." "What will you do, Rajan? Haven't decided yet.. ..whether to go to court or get this printed in the newspapers. Everyone's present in today's party. Your wife, my child, uncle, Rekha and her in laws. Why not inform them all together? Come with me. Raian, what a terrible thing you are doing! Today's Rekha's engagement. The guests have come. And.. And it is a nice chance for me to take revenge. Rekha's life will be ruined. After all, she's your sis, too. This relation ended that same day when uncle.. ..insulted me in front of everyone by slapping me. And you kept watching quietly? - Forgive me, Rajan. Let Rekha's engagement finish. Then we'll do what you want. lt is a question of our family's prestige. My dignity is more precious than that of the family. Raian, l am ready to pay any price for that. Then sign on this cheque. l'll fill up the amount of my dignity myself. Deepak, you're getting engaged now. l don't want to see you in the parks then. Brother! Forgive me, barrister, but l want to say something to you. ls there some problem? - l want to talk to you privately. Why? You can say that here. What happened? lt is a warrant to arrest Mira! She has already married before? - Yes, to your nephew Rajan! Raian had married Mira secretly? They also have a child, which she calls that of her friend. This is false. Totally wrong. l see everything, bro. Raian has played this trick to defame you. That might be possible. But l'm bound by my duty. She will have to come with me right now. l understand. But how can you take her now? You see we have.. Let her go, father. Whatever the inspector has said is true. She had a relation with Raian and it is her child. How can you say that? - Read this, father. You'll know all the evil deeds of your daughter in law. And you'll also know why she requested you to forgive Rajan. You keep quiet. Daughter in law, have you written this letter? Since the day l told you that l'm going to be.. l'm starting a new life by being the daughter in law of a rich family Father, this is my handwriting. But this letter is false. Whatever is written in here is wrong. Believe me, father. l have no relation with Raian. - Then whose child is this? You had told me yourself that it is your child, hadn't you? Yes, l had said that it is my child. But l have no relation with Rajan. What is this that l hear, daughter in law? Banne Khan, do you hear that? lnspector, take her. And take along this bundle of sin also. Take her, inspector. Don't worry, Mira. l'll soon bring the lawyer for your bail. You still want to get me a bail after l am accused so badly? The moon doesn't become dirty even if we throw mud at it, Mira. This is the matter. Brother's dignity is ruined because of daughter in law. This is false! All this is false. Father, all this is wrong. - What is wrong, child? Mira is not the mother of this child. It is me! l am the mother of this child. And it is not Raian who is his father. It is him! l thought my son had got his rights in this house. You made him your grandchild by adopting him. But l didn't know he would hate his own child. That he would hate his own blood. That he would hate a goddess like Mira who accepted.. ..his child by listening to my request and covered his mistake. Now you tell me Shyam whether what she said is true or false. Answer me, Shyam! - It is true that l wanted to marry Radha.. And that child is also yours. Believe me, father, it is his child. l believe you. But why didn't you tell me all this before? Banne Khan, are you listening this? - Yes, l am, brother. l doubted my daughter in law! l doubted.. Brother! - Father! Bro, God forbid, if something happens to you.. ..l'll kill Rajan. My trick has worked. l've revenged for my insult from both uncle and Shyam. You haven't revenged. You've proved how low you are. Mother! - Your mother's dead. And it would have been better.. ..if you had died as soon as you were born. Worthless! Wretched! You played with the dignity of the family for a trifle revenge? Do you know, that the child's real father is Shyam? And his mother is not Mira, but Radha. Radha is the mother of that child? - Yes, Radha. You've accused Mira so amully.. ..that brother in law will never forgive you. Mira's statement tomorrow will get you in jail. Mira will not reach the court. Come on. - Raian, what are you going to do now? l won't let you go. - Let me go, mother. l said, l won't let you go. - Leave me, mother. Thank you, lawyer. Come, Mira. Come, child. Get a bail for daughter in law now. And take her back home with respect. Come. Mira! - Yes. - Whose child is this? lt is my child. Everyone has believed that. But l don't believe it. It is a sin to think such a bad thing about you. Whose sin are you trying to hide by accepting this child? Raian's disgusting accusations have taken this matter to the court. lf you still keep quiet, Shyam and his father will be blemished. And your mother? She has recovered after a long ailment. Do you want to lose her? No, don't say such thing, doctor. Sometimes even the duty becomes helplessness. Only God and l know what was my helplessness. l fulfilled my duty at the risk of falling.. ..from the eyes of my husband. But Raian has forced me.. ..to tell the secret of this child by accusing my purity. Shyam is the father of this child. l don't know who his mother is. Come, Mira. What happened, mister? - That.. that.. You take care of the child. l'll deal with them. Kill Mira before she regains consciousness. Not a bad idea. The doctor will be accused and you'll get out scot-free. Sister Mira! Sister Mira! Leave me! Brother! Shyam! Radha! Back off, Radha. Move aside, Radha. There's a ditch behind. Radha, move aside! Get hold of him. Radha? Shyam, move the car behind. Silly, you didn't care for your life to save mine. What if something had happened to you? lf l could sacrifice my life.. ..for a goddess like you, all my troubles would end. lf you had written your name in that letter, Radha.. ..you wouldn't have had to go through all these troubles. And neither would l have had to show that l am Shyam's wife. Why did you do this, sister Mira? l had only requested you give the child his rights. l could have done that anytime, Radha. But how would you get iustice then? God knows that l never considered Shyam my husband. l lied that the child is mine, only to save your husband. l was sure that the memory of the child will keep his mother alive. And one day she'll surely come to me. That day has come, Radha.. ..when l should return your child and your husband to you. Mira, what are you saying? - l am telling the truth, father. Before bringing the child to this house.. ..l had vowed in front of God that.. ..along with the child l'll get his mother her right. Why didn't you think before vowing that you were married to Shyam? But before my marriage.. ..Shyam and Radha had already become one. We can respect your feelings for Radha. But we cannot allow you.. ..to take any step against the society or the religion. The religion teaches us humanity, father. lt does not allow us to snatch away someone's rights. Shyam is the child's father. And Radha is the mother. lt is impossible for me.. ..to interfere between them after knowing this. Father, tell me, who has the right to be his wife? Me or Radha? Answer to that, Shyam. Why did you marry Mira when you had accepted Radha? Father, l had accepted Radha as my wife.. ..in front of God thinking her to be Mr. Shrma's daughter. And thinking that l'm going to marry her. l had no bad intentions when l accepted Radha. Nor did l want to cheat her. But it was my bad luck.. ..that l misunderstood Radha and married Mira. Do you know what a big mistake you've done? But what is your decision now? lf Mira can forgive me, l am ready to accept Radha. Never! We have no relationship now. And there can't be one either. Father, if l'm ready to Iet go of my right.. ..if Shyam is ready to accept Radha.. Shameless! Do you realize what you're saying? You would understand what l am saying, mother.. ..if Radha was your daughter instead of me. Just think, mother. You're a wife and also a mother. Would you want your child.. ..and your husband to be seized away from you? Stop talking rubbish, Mira. Believe me, father. If you refuse my request.. ..which even God has accepted.. ..l'll break all the rules of the society by killing myself. But l'll never remain happy by shattering the dreams of Radha. This is my decision. And this is my vow. Shivcharan, you should be proud of such a daughter. The world has many stories of a woman's sacrifice and greatness. But no one has ever heard of a woman sacrificing.. ..her nuptials to give another woman her right. Your daughter has reached the greatness.. ..of a woman to that peak which is matchless. Shivcharan, l've agreed to her decision. You agree, too. One should get what is his right. You are right, Shukla. Child, we've agreed to your decision. - Father! Child, you came to this house as a daughter in law. Today you're standing in front of me as a goddess. Radha, your maternal love will never be restless now. Sister Mira! Mira, child, if we were allowed.. ..to worship anyone except God, l would worship you. lt is the duty of a human to be of service to others. Only his life is successful who knows this secret. Only his life is successful who knows this secret.
