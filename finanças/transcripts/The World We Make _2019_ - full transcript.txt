[woman] All right, so just watch his ears, okay? So... who's he paying attention to right now? He's listening to me. See his ear? Oh, a little sass! You see that? He's trying to get out. All right, when he does that, I'm just gonna make him work a little bit harder. Okay? So, I'm keeping him moving. He disobeyed a little bit. Keeping him moving. I'm teaching him that when he disobeys, he gets work, and when he obeys, he gets rest. So, when he obeys and he's trotting well and he's listening... Good, Cody. Turning my back to him, giving him a break. And if he's learned his lesson... Let's see. Is he gonna come? -Good boy, Cody. -So cool. Good job, sis. What you wanna do is you wanna make your loop big. And then you wanna hold it where the ropes go. You wanna grab it with this hand. You gotta be the boss, right? Because the horse always has to have a leader. And if you're not gonna be the leader, then he's gonna be the leader, okay? [grunting] [laughing] I'm not a steer. Hold on. Now hold up. Pull back hard. Pull back towards your belly. Come on, yeah, pull it. There you go. Perfect. High five. Thank you. Thank you, guys. I'll see you Wednesday, okay? So good to see you. [woman] Lee. I just wanted to thank you so much. Bella loves her lessons. Thank you. You're really doing amazing, Bella. I can't believe you only have six months left of high school. -Yeah. -Do you know what you want to do when you graduate? No, not yet. [horse whinnies] If I hear one more person ask me what I wanna do when I graduate... It's like I'm being slowly tortured every day by the mothers of my students. You'll figure it out. What if I don't? You're lucky. You already know what you want to do. Why don't you just go to college like everyone else? You didn't. I know. I'm not like everyone else. I wanted to be here, not in a classroom. You get way better grades than I ever got. You can probably go to any school you want. Yeah, but I don't want to waste all that time and money if I don't know what I want to do. Well, there's nothing wrong with staying here, training horses and giving lessons. The kids love you. Yeah, and I love it. [sighs] I just want to do something big. You know? Something epic that'll really push me, that's unique and... significant. So you want to be a person of distinction? [scoffs] Gross. Now you sound like Dad. I used to get so sick of hearing that growing up. Well, he doesn't really say it anymore. Yeah, I guess it has been a while. I just wish I could figure out what I'm supposed to do. Hey. Dreams take time. Sometimes you find your path when you least expect it. That's easy for you to say. [horse blusters] What's that? Okay. Chief says he's tired of listening to your problems and he wants to go run. Isn't that right, Chief? Okay! What's that? What? Oh, okay, I'll make sure I tell him. Cody's concerned that you're not gonna be able to handle losing to your baby sister again. [laughs] Again? That's never gonna happen. Okay, all right. Come on. Let's go, Chief. [laughing] All right. I'm already winning. I don't remember any time you've ever beaten me. Come on. [both chuckling] [panting] Did you let me win? No. I would never do that. Let's go again. Well, that was the warm-up. Okay. Oh, you want to actually race for real? Yeah. [laughing] It's two out of three anyway. [video game beeps] Dude, come play. I can't kill all these undead things on my own. In a minute. [Lee] Hey, Jordan. Hey, Lee. Done shoveling you-know-what? Can I say that to a Southern belle? I am not a Southern belle. And there's a lot more to keeping horses than that. Casey, how can this guy be your best friend for so long and still be so clueless about horses? Oh, he hates horses. He's scared of 'em. [scoffs] I'm not scared. They're just all stinky and scratchy. How would you know? You've barely been around them. I just know. What, are you a horse-ist? A what? I don't know. It's my word for someone bigoted against horses. [chuckles] Good try. It's not a word. Don't mess with the etymologist. Oh, okay, well, impressive vocab, college boy. But you should probably just stick to football. Happy to. And that whole little wingback thingy you do. I'm a tailback, and your brother was a fullback. Neither of them start with "wing." I don't know why she can't remember that. Okay, whatever. I... He just got a scholarship offer to play at the best school in California. Wait, really? Jordan, but... Wait, how does that work? You're already in college. D2 transfer. You're gonna have to explain that to a horse girl. I'm transferring from a small school to a big school. That's huge. You've got the next two years of your life figured out. Any beyond that, too. They got a pretty great business school. I'm so happy for you. Thanks, Lee. [sighs] [Casey] Jubilee! What? Jubilee! Get in here. I forgot that was her real name. Are you ready to play yet? What? I figured it out. We're gonna ride our horses cross-country. What are you talking about? You remember those riders that stayed on our property when we were kids? Not really. That's what they were doing. It took me a while, but I found a whole bunch of routes on the web. It's gonna take us about three months. But as soon as you graduate, we're gonna jump on Cody and Chief and we're gonna ride west... until I can throw my lucky horseshoe into the Pacific. Come on, Lee. It'll be epic. Y'all have lost it. I mean, what are you gonna do? Get on your horse and ride down the freeway? No, there's a system of trails, back roads, and farms that people have already trekked. That's incredible. [Jordan] That can't be safe. That's the whole point. That's the adventure. -We could run out of water. -[Lee] Or food. -[Casey] We could get lost. -[Lee] Our horses could go lame or get sick. Some days we could ride for 30 miles and not see another soul. I mean, think about the challenge. This would be the hardest thing we've ever done. And you'll get time to get away and think about your future. Yeah. I love it. But what will Dad think? Who cares. What do you think? This is about something big, Lee. Let's do it. Let me show you something. Okay, all right. I don't get you horse people. Logan! Your brother's stuck in horse land. Help me kill these ghouls. They're zombies. Whatever, just help me win. All right, see ya, Dad! Gotta head down to the group home for a bit. Hey, whoa, was that that Big Brother thing you're talking about? Yeah. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I'm proud of you. And, um, just so you know, your name's written all over that one over there. Oh, wow. When do you think that'll be done? I don't know. Whenever I finish this one. Thanks, Dad. Well, no hurry. I like my old truck. See ya, Dad. Yep. Have fun, son. [music playing on radio] Wha... [tires squeal] [branches snapping] -[glass breaks] -[horn honking] [sighs, sniffles] Okay. Come on, buddy. Let's go. [cell phone beeps] [bell rings] Mint chocolate. Your favorite. Thank you, Brooklyn. See? I know my girl. You are the best. You didn't answer my texts last night. You all right? Yeah. I just got a lot of work to do on the farm right now. Sorry. It's keeping me busy. Hmm. Yo, Lee. What's up, Brooklyn? What's going on, ladies? Hey, so, our band's got a gig this week at the barn. Y'all should come. We're debuting. We're called Black Eye Culture. It's gonna be awesome. Everybody's gonna be there. Oh, thanks for the heads up. Yeah. And I know that you don't get out much, so you should come. Yeah, I've got a lot going on right now. But we'll see. It'll take your mind off things. So I'll text you. Okay. Yeah. He can't handle that you turned him down last summer. He's totally still into you. [laughs] No. He flirts like that with everyone, Brook. Girl, you cannot be that clueless. What are you eating, Logan? What? That's all there is. Uh, why don't you just ask Dad to get more food? How? I never see him. He's either at work or in the garage. Hey, Dad. Hey. Uh, I really need you to make Logan's lunch for tomorrow morning. He's been eating junk all day. You know where the wallet is. Give him some money. No. Dad, I mean I need you to go get him some food from the store. There's barely any left. Fine. Dad, he's still just a kid. You need to make him a meal every once in a while. I have a test tomorrow. And I have twice the amount of work to do at the barn. I can't do it all. You know what? Then why don't you just sell Chief. What? Lee, I don't know anything about this horse stuff. But what I do know is he'd be a lot less work if you got rid of him. [scoffs] You know what? Why don't you let me handle the horses and you work on being an actual father and taking care of your son who needs you. [door slams] [clicks tongue] Come on, buddy. Good boy. Don't worry. I'm not gonna let them sell you. Okay? [kisses] [Lee] What are you doing here? You all right? Yeah, I'm fine. Just working out some of the horses. What's up? Just wanted to come by and see how you and everyone else was doing. You guys were kind of like a family to me when I didn't have much family to go home to. Just wanted to come check in, see if I can help out with something. Don't you have football stuff to do? Not now. Just conditioning. I can do some of that here, you know. Throw around some of those hay cubes, or whatever you call them. Uh, I guess I could use the help. Uh, maybe just a little, you know, filling in for what Casey used to do. Yeah, 100%. Maybe you could come by Saturday, if you wanted? Yeah. I'm up early working out anyway. 5:30 a.m.? Wow. Uh... I guess I could go to sleep a little earlier. It would only be three mornings a week and maybe Saturday, if you have the time. Yeah, consider it done. Thank you, Jordan. So much. Maybe you could use this time to yourself... just to process everything, you know? I know I needed that when my mom left us. I'm fine, Jordan. All right. [chuckles] All right. [sighs] Now, remember, I'm a city kid. Don't get your expectations up too high. I don't know the first thing about a barn. And you know I hate horses. But I can shovel. Well, if that's what you like, I've got plenty of that to do. Or maybe something cleaner. [laughs] I like the idea of staying clean. No such thing when you're with horses. I'll see you Saturday? Yeah. Bright and way too early. All right, sounds good. [sighs] Dad! Dad! Yeah! Yeah! Come on. Breakfast. I'm making your favorite. Get up. Let's go. What? Come on. Breakfast. I'm gonna do a cross-country ride. [Logan] Can I go? No. Jordan said he'd help just with the chores, so I will have time to train the horses. He'll get sick of that fast. He hates horses. Well, either way, I'll still figure it out. So it's just like the time you built that tree house in the backyard, right? What are you talking about? You go out in the backyard to try and build a tree house, and who ended up fixing it? Casey. I was 12. It's not like that. This is gonna be different, Dad. Whatever. I'm doing this, Dad. [horse whinnies] Logan, it's time for bed. Logan? Good night. Hey, this is the first night I haven't had to pry you away from the video games. What, are you sick? I'm just tired of being by myself all the time. I want somebody to hang out with. What's gonna happen when you go? It's just gonna be for a couple of months. Dad will be better by then. Are you sure? I miss how Mom used to put me to bed. Remember how she'd tuck in the covers real tight? Come on. Let's go. [laughs] Hey. Don't worry, okay? I'm here for you. No matter what. Good night, Logan. [horse whinnies] Whoa! [Lee] Yeah, I specialize in physical therapy using horseback riding. [woman] I didn't realize you could. It really works well with kids that love to ride. This is great. So, I'll teach you some exercises that you can do with her. First make sure her knee brace is on tight. Okay. Open it up and pull it snug. Cool, so you wanna go for a spin? All right. I'm gonna take these reigns from you. We're just gonna come on in here. [chatter continues indistinctly] Hey, Dad! Wanna play some basketball? Maybe later. Mr. Grove. Hey. Hey, uh, why don't I take this up to the house, and you maybe play some basketball with Logan? It would mean a lot to him. Yeah, yeah, sure. I bet you're really good at basketball. [scoffs] What makes you say that? Uh, just because you grew up around it, and, uh, I just-- Because I'm black? Well, that, and you're an athlete. Well, maybe you should be careful with your assumptions. You might hurt some people. Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Won't happen again. I'm actually pretty bad at basketball. [laughs] Okay. So he'll probably beat me. Okay, cool. Thanks. If it gets too bad, I'll be running in the house. [laughs] Hey, check up, little man. Whoa! Ooh! Oh! Okay, all right, pressure's on. Money! [grunting] Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Let's go, baby. Yeah, winner takes all. Next point wins. Oh, take that! [grunting] Oh, no! What you got? Pressure's on, bro! Five, four... You sure about this? ...three, two, one! Whoo! Ha ha! Ah! Ah! He makes it! Whoo! Whoo! Yeah! Oh, that was awesome! Yeah! [sighs] You're getting good, man. Thanks. Yeah. Hey, have you ever, uh, seen your sister like, really sad about your brother's death? Like... Like, let out a big, ugly cry. I don't know. Maybe a little. I mean, at the funeral. We just don't hang out that much. Ah. You know, being sad's okay. It's how you get through it. I had to learn the hard way after my mom... left us for some rich guy. Took years for me to finally let it all out. Then I finally wasn't so mad anymore. I cried a lot... about Casey. That's good. Your family can learn from you, little man. [chuckles] All right, I got one more in me. All right. I start. Yeah. Let's do this. [panting] Hello, pretty lady. Oh, I didn't forget about you, girl. [Lee] A granola bar? Really? You're spoiling them, you know. Just trying to butter these old ladies up. -You know I'm a flirt. -They're boys, you know. Right. [scoffs] I thought you hated horses. I'm trying to give 'em a chance. I don't want to be a horse-ist since we're all gonna be in the same work space. Okay, well, just no junk food, please. I'm trying to get 'em trained up. Sure thing, boss. Whoa. What's he doing? That's Chief. He was Casey's. I think he likes you. Yeah, I'm still getting used to these things. [laughs] You are scared of them. Okay, maybe a little bit. But, uh, I'm all done, so I was gonna take off. Thanks. You know, for spending time with Logan. I haven't seen him smile like that in days. Pleasure's all mine. So, what's all that stuff on the table? I'm gonna do the cross-country ride. Just after graduation, like Case and I planned. Really? Yeah. So, how does this work? You're just gonna get on a horse and ride off into the sunset? Well, I mean do you just put on your wingback helmet and jump on the field? [laughs] No. It's tailback. Well, it's like prepping for an ultramarathon, so I'll have to train three horses: Cody, Chief, and a packhorse. You have to get them all ready just in case one of them gets hurt. Are you really gonna do all of this by yourself? Well, I mean, I'll have the horses. And I'll meet up with some riders on the trail, I'm sure. Oh, that sounds really safe. Toothless mountain men coming out of the woods with guns and stuff. Oh, shut up. This is my dream. I'm all about dreams. Talk to me. I want to prove I can do something big. To my dad, to Case, and to myself. I just need to get out of here for a while and think about my life. Figure out my place in the world. You gotta do it. Me and Case always talked about, you know, dreams aren't easy. But they're worth fighting for. I believe in you, Lee. I really do. I'm so sorry. I don't know what that was. [chuckles] Uh, don't worry about it. I should... I should probably just go. Yeah, yeah. Okay. See you Monday? Yeah. Monday. Bright and way too early. Yeah. Pop, when's that salt coming? It's on the way. [sighs] When you gonna get me one of them smart TVs so I can see all your touchdowns? [scoffs] Maybe if you'd stop gambling so much, you can afford one yourself. What'd you say, son? Pop, you know I'm saving my money for school. You need to tell those recruiters to get you some cash under the table. Or a Corvette. Yeah, you said that a dozen times. It's a scholarship, Pop. They're not gonna pay me. Look, I'm just trying to help you get ahead. Don't be too proud to take some advice from your old man who's been there and done that. You understand, son? Yes, sir. [groans] Pop, when are you gonna get the faucet fixed? Can't afford it. They cut back my hours at the factory. But you can afford Internet poker? Last time they cut back my hours, this hustle kept us afloat. Yeah, well, maybe you could try, uh, blackjack. [scoffs, laughs] Statistically, the odds are higher. Statistically. Blackjack don't take no skill. Yeah, well, you been losing more than you've been winning. You got a great job with a decent wage. You need to stop. You need to stay out of my business. [knocks] Kim. Come on in. Good to see you as usual. How's school? It's good, sir. Thanks. Jordan, Kim stopped by. Hey. I, uh... brought you some salt. Yeah. Sorry to bother you about that. It's no problem. It's not hard to walk 100 feet down the sidewalk. Hmm. What were you doing up so early the other day? Been working at the Grove's farm. [father] Yeah, that family's been through it. Wife gets cancer. Casey gets-- Dad. All Jeff Grove's radio station money can't fix that. Just goes to show: Tragedy shows no favorites. His sister is in my grade. Were you helping her? Yeah. A little bit. Oh. Well, that's sweet of you. Uh... thanks for the salt. Anytime. [chuckles] Bye. Bye. Gotta get you in shape. Pay attention to me. Ah. Get your butt in. [clicks tongue] Get up. Good boy. Good boy. Day one, right? Yeah. Hey, sorry I'm late. Don't worry about it. Uh, so, what do you want me to do? Maybe you could get some hay and get them ready to feed. Okay, sure. Okay, thanks. Yeah. Okay. [sighs] About the other day? What about it? [laughs] Uh, the kiss? Oh, yeah. Uh-huh. I don't know, I just wanted to bring it up so it didn't create anything weird between us. Yeah, I could see how that would, uh, be kinda weird. I mean, I'm fine. But I just... Yeah, that would be good. Uh... I don't even know what that was. I don't know. I mean, I know you miss your brother. And maybe I represent something. Or maybe you want to be close to someone you know when you're sad, or... maybe it was for me. I'm pretty sure it was just for you. Okay, that's good. Uh... It's all kind of unexpected, I guess. [laughs] All right, well, uh, what do we do now? Should I just grab the hay or... Yeah, and I guess I will just wait for a chivalrous young man like yourself to one day ask me out on a date. Well, I'm not really sure this chivalrous man has the means to impress a fair lady like yourself. I think he underestimates her. She is but a fair country girl with simple taste. Well, if that's the case... I shall no longer delay, my fair maiden. Would you mind joining me for dinner in a fortnight's time? Two weeks from now? No I just like the word "fortnight." Okay. What about this weekend? I would be delighted. Jordan Bishop. What is going on? When did this happen, and why did I not know about this? Okay, it literally came out of nowhere. And he's just so smart and solid and sweet... And in college! Yeah. Isn't that weird? He works the front desk at my gym. Yeah, weekends. And he's... African-American? Yes. Oh, really? I had no idea. This is blowing my mind. I gotta sit down. Morgan isn't going to be happy. [Lee] Please. Morgan couldn't care less. Are you sure you're ready for the racial drama? I had a friend-- It'll be fine. It's not like we're in the 1960s. We've had a black president. Everyone is all progressive and everything now. Okay, whatever. So, when is he taking you out? Friday night. Wow. [laughs] Well, you look very dapper yourself. [chuckles] Thank you. Join me for an evening stroll, my lady? Are you gonna tell me why I wasn't allowed in the barn all afternoon? Ah, patience, my fair maiden. We got the only reservation in town. [chuckles] [laughs] You might want to wait until you taste the food. [laughs] So, he plays football and cooks. [laughs] Well, I guess you pick up a few things when you grow up without a mom. My dad never saw you do any of this? Nope. Why doesn't he ever come down here? He bought this whole place for my mom. I think the horses remind him of her, so he hasn't come down to the barn since she died. Well, it could be worse, given what he's been through. He's a good man. Yeah. You just don't see it too much these days. I remember all his speeches about being a man of distinction. They were kinda cheesy, but it worked. It got me thinking. You know? It made a difference. Really? Well, then you need to tell me: What are your plans to be a man of distinction? Well, I start at a new college in six months. I'll be there for two years, finish my undergrad in business. Then, Lord willing, I'll go to the pros. But the average career only lasts 3.3 years, statistically speaking. Wow, you must love statistics. [chuckles] Numbers are everything. After my 3.3 years, I'll save that money and go back and get my MBA. Avoid debt. Probably get an executive job, work my way up the corporate ladder to some executive suite. [laughs] Very impressive. So, where did all that come from? All my pop ever wanted to do was gamble. I don't want to be like that. Gonna be the first person in my family to earn a degree. Only 56% of students finish. Statistically speaking? Exactly. [laughs] Well, a toast. To big dreams. As a dreamer, somebody who's always looking to the future, it's kind of hard to ignore the fact that you're leaving in May and I'm leaving in August, right? It's only our first date. True. [laughs] Uh, are you hungry for dessert? Always. Well, we're gonna have to go to the store because I might have given all the ice cream to Cody and Chief. -You didn't. -[laughs] Hey, I'll be right in. I just gotta respond to Brook. Something with mint chocolate? Of course. -[door opens] -[bell dings] [door closes] Hey, did you get it? What's up? The store owner is following me. No, he's just checking inventory. Stay here. Watch this. Okay. Oh, my gosh. You're totally right. What's his problem? It happens all the time. Look, don't worry about it. Don't let it ruin our date. No. We have to do something. Come on. Okay. If you want to. Let's go. Hey, sir, were you following me because I'm a male? Uh, I'm not-- Let me give you a tip. So, I attend the local college where I'm taking Sociology 210. And there I'm learning that women are more likely to engage in retail theft than men. Statistically speaking. I didn't mention any stats, but it's at 4% and rising. Really? That much. Yeah. Read it in a scientific journal. Wow, that's fascinating. I thought so myself. So you should probably follow her next time. Probably so. Now, I would love to purchase these items. You can take them. I don't-- No. I want to pay. Like everybody else. I don't need any special treatment. Okay. All right. I'll ring them up for you behind the counter. [cash register beeps] [sighs] Is that what it's always gonna be like? [sighs] That's probably as easy as it gets. You down for this? 100%. So, here's how you throw it. All right? Okay. The wind caught and moved the ball. [male singer] ♪ 'Cause I know that I've found forever ♪ ♪ In the love that we have... ♪ Yeah.

Have you ever thought about, after your trip, just staying out West? Being in LA with me? [laughs] You wanted to do something big. Yeah, I'd love to. But I mean, I never thought I'd be the kind of girl that'd chase a guy across the country. And it's really just not something I can think about, you know? It's really just not a good time. I'm so behind in my training as it is, and my dad is still a wreck. Hey, did you ever tell your dad about me? Yeah. You did? No, no. I... No, I didn't. Are you listening? [sighs] Have they been staring the whole time? Yes. Well, can't you just look at me? We'll make our own little world right here. Okay. [sighs] So, uh, did you tell your dad? I've been thinking about it. But it's not really a great time, just with everything that's been going on at home and... Jordan? [sighs] Can we just get out of here? I don't want to sit here watching people stare at us all night. Sure. [chattering] Hi. Uh, Kim, right? Yes. We had math freshman year. I remember. What's up? Have you even thought about what you're doing? [chuckles] Maybe you're not as woke as I thought. -I'm sorry? -[scoffs] You know, girls like me don't have a lot of options around here. You could have any guy you want, but you wanna chase the one good guy in my neighborhood. So if you're trying to ease your white guilt or be all progressive or whatever, you just know you're making it worse. What was that about? Uh, she just wanted something for class. You have class with her? All right, so I got the big show tomorrow night. -Will I see you both there? -Yeah. Totally. Yeah? And what about you, Lee? Uh, I don't know, Morgan. Well, I'll make sure you have a good time. Hopefully I'll see y'all there. I'll shoot you the address. Come on, Lee. You have to take some time to have some fun. It's our last few months of high school. Okay. Okay. [Morgan singing] ♪ Got 50,000 fans Want to hear me sing, girl ♪ ♪ I can go buy any, anything It's true ♪ ♪ But I'd trade It all for you ♪ -[music ends] -[cheers, applause] [Morgan] Thank you guys so much. Up next we've got Edge of Reality. Let's give them a big round of applause, guys. He's good. He's okay. Look at this. Lee has finally graced me with that beautiful presence. [chuckles] You know, I'm out all the time working. Just not with you anymore. Maybe we should change that. Where's Jordan at? He is with Kyle and Paul. He finally let you off your leash? Jordan doesn't have me on any leash. Good to know. Well, maybe I could pick you up tomorrow night and take you out? So we can catch up and talk about what happened last summer. Just give me a chance. No, thanks. Coffee? I have a boyfriend now, Morgan. I didn't realize you guys were that serious. I figured you were just experimenting, you know, since he's... [scoffs] Lee. It's not a big deal. He didn't know. Are you seriously taking his side? Look. I tried to tell you this would be hard. You didn't want to listen. Yeah. I can't deal with this right now. Jordan, will you please take me home? You all right? Yeah, uh... Are you sure we're doing the right thing? What do you mean? Like, you and me. Are you sure that this is okay? [chuckles] Yes. Definitely. Okay. I think you've had too many 5:30 a.m. mornings. [chuckles] Yeah, you're probably right. I haven't had nearly enough time to prep the horses. But I think it'll be okay as long as I don't have anymore distractions. Oh, well, don't let me stand in your way. [Logan] Hey. Hey. What are you doing? Well, um, I kinda need some help with my science project. It's due tomorrow, and there's no foam core. Why are you just telling me this now? 'Cause I just thought of it now. [scoffs] And what, did you think the foam core was just gonna fall out of the sky? No, I thought you'd drive me to the store. Dad's gone. Okay. Yeah, let's go. You know, I'm a little hungry, too. [scoffs] So now I'm your driver and your cook? Yeah. You're the best. Uh-huh. All right, you're just saying that because you want me to do your science fair project for you. [Jordan] I can't believe I finally did that. [laughs] Dad. What are you doing out here? [Jordan] What's up, Mr. Grove? [sighs deeply] -Oh. -Dad. That's amazing. [Jordan] That thing looks brand new. Well, then why don't you two take her out for a spin tonight? No. That's okay. Why not? Cars are meant to be driven. Go. Go ahead. You were gonna go to co-op for me anyway. You... You're not gonna come with me? No. I've got so much training to do and I'm so behind. But you should go and have fun. You sure, Mr. Grove? This car was supposed to be for Casey. I'm sure he'd want you to drive it first. Hey. Just go drive the doggone thing. Hey, do you want a granola bar? Right? I know I'm a sucker. I know. Don't tell Jordan. [softly] Don't tell him. [bell tinkles] Hey. You work here? For about the last two months. Can I help you? Nah, I'm just looking. Are you sure? You been looking at those. They're pretty cool. Especially for someone who likes horses. [scoffs] Yeah, I can see that. I... I wonder if someone like that would really understand what you've been through as a black man. Should I ask someone else to help me or... No, I just like to educate my customers on their purchases. -Can I take a look at that one? -Yeah. Morgan. Well, I guess you give a brother a scholarship to a D1 school and they just give him anything he wants now, huh? Classic Benz. It's nice. -Yeah, let's not lean on the car. -Sure, man. You know what? Let me get the smudge off for you real quick. Hey, man. I'm serious. Back away from the car. What? You're not gonna offer your boys a ride? In this really, really... What do they call it in your neighborhood? Swag, right? We'd love to see how a swag car this good drives. Not now. I'm late. What you rushing off for? Got a date with Lee tonight? You know, what does she see in you? Morgan, I'm serious. Move. You want to know why you got the better scholarship? Affirmative action. Yeah, that's right. I had similar numbers to you this year. That's the only reason why you're ever gonna get anything. That's funny. I would've thought it was because you were no good. [grunting] -[thuds] -[cracks] [groans] Dude, dude, we gotta go! Dude! Dude! [cell phone ringing] Dad? What? I'm right in the middle of something. My son was just looking at that car when that thug attacked him. Dad, it's just a fractured wrist. It's really nothing. [father] It could've been your throwing arm. Hi. What room is Jordan Bishop in? [nurse] 240. 240. Thank you. [machine beeping] [sniffles, sighs] I'm here, Jordan. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Let's just give her a little time alone, okay? [Logan] Is he gonna be all right? I don't know. Let's go see if we can get some answers. Come on. [groans] Nurse? Nurse! He's waking up. [groans] Are you okay? What happened? Let's see. Oh, my head. Hey. Yeah, I just wanna let you know he, uh... he has a concussion. But, um, something's going on with his knee. I'm not exactly sure what. Excuse me, Mr. Grove? Hey, Thomas, let me call you right back. Hi, Officer. Mr. Wallace, the other boy's father, said you may be wanting to file a grand theft auto charge? What are you talking about? Well, your Mercedes was at the scene, and the suspect-- Are you talking about... Are you talking about Jordan Bishop? Yes, Mr. Bishop was driving it. Mr. Bishop was driving the car because I gave Mr. Bishop the keys. Officer, do you have anything else? If not, I'd like to call the boy's father. No, Mr. Grove. I was just following up for Mr. Wallace's information. That's all. Thank you. Have a good day. [sighs] Good night. Hey, Thomas. Sorry about that. [sighs] [clears throat] How is he? He's good. The doctors just finished checking him over. So he's sleeping. Is his dad coming? He's working the double shift. He's gonna come in the morning. We should stay with him. Where's, uh... Where's Logan? Uh, he crashed in Jordan's room. I'm gonna go grab a snack. Okay. So, um, how are you? Hmm. I've been better. You know, I, uh, kinda connected the dots. What do you mean? Between you and Jordan. You're obviously more than friends. Why would you keep that a secret from me? I was gonna tell you. But it's not like you're ever around. Besides, I knew you'd be angry. [scoffs] So that's what you think of me? Everybody else seems to have a problem with it. I'm sorry I didn't tell you. I was worried you'd be upset... because he was Casey's best friend. Well, one good thing about your big brother: He... He always was a good judge of character. Hey, it's late. Just go get Logan, and maybe Brooklyn will give you a ride home. All right? Maybe she'll even stay the night. I'll stay here. He's gonna be fine. Okay. Get outta here. Go. Thanks, Dad. Mr. Bishop? Here's what we have. The MRI shows that you have a tear in your ACL. Now, I don't think you'll have to have surgery, but you're gonna have to undergo some intensive physical therapy once the swelling goes down. It'll recover in a few months if you take care of it. Okay, good. But what I'm most concerned about is your concussion. The CT scan shows some internal bleeding and some signs of scar tissue which may have been from a previous concussion. Probably from playing football. You don't want to have more than three. So, I can play ball? Uh, it's tough to say. Worst case, with a few more bad hits, and you could wind up with CTE, which could lead to mental breakdowns, erratic behavior, premature dementia. The only way I have of paying for college is that football scholarship. So, what am I supposed to do, Doc? I'm, um... I'm sorry. I can't answer that. Only you can make that decision. [sighs] Folks come back from torn ACLs. Happens all the time. My knee is gonna heal. It's my head I'm worried about. Oh, them doctors don't know what they're talking about. You're a Bishop. You're built like a brick. With some hard work, you can get back on that field. Pop, I love football. But this isn't about that. It's about everything else I want to accomplish in life. -One more blow-- -You can't afford college without that scholarship. Look, son... you're really good. You got a chance to play on Sunday. And get paid. Is it worth me risking my brain? No risk, no reward. Look, you either man up and show 'em you still got what it takes, or... well, I can probably get you some work down at the factory. No, I don't want to work at the factory. You think you're too good to work at the factory. You think you're better than your old man? No, no, no. I just got other dreams. Yeah, you're a sharp kid. In ten years or so, you could work your way up to supervisor, make a pretty good wage. Mm-hmm. No, I'm gonna get some loans. Pay for it myself. Nah, nah. See, that's exactly what the government wants. Get you 150 grand in debt. Take you 25 years of working for the man to pay it off. It's all over TV. College ain't worth that kind of debt. Well, I started it. I gotta finish it. Then you best get back out on that field and pretend like nothing happened. I would have had the money if you hadn't gambled it all away. [grunts] [panting] [screams] [sobbing] [engine stops] [knocks] Hey, babe. How are you? I'm glad you're here. You don't have to stay long. I know you got horses to train. There's nowhere I'd rather be. That's my girl. [laughs] I may have to take some time off my job at the farm. [chuckles] I will talk to management and see if I can get it approved, okay? [both laugh] Oh, hey, how's your concussion? Doctor says it's fine. Nothing to worry about. Good. That could've been the end of football for you. I'm just ready to get back and start rehabbing. I think I can get back by the fall. I don't have all the money I need for PT, but maybe I can watch some videos online or something. We'll figure it out. Can I hire that girl with the bad knee on the horse? Um, I think she's a little busy with sixth grade homework. But I think I could do it. I mean, I remember everything that we did. No, no. You've done enough. Your plate's full. No. This is your dream. Football's the start of it. Look, I can push my trip back to the fall. I'm way behind in my training as it is. No, no. No, you're not doing that. Your broken dreams are worth putting back together. Yeah. They are. Besides, I gotta get you back to playing wingman. [laughs] It's wingback, you wing nut. Okay. [chuckles] [sighs] You know, my dad's gonna be home soon. Um, you might want to take off. I just... I just don't feel like dealing with all that today. Yeah. I get it. But, hey, at least you're gonna finally ride a horse. I don't know what's worse, a stinky horse or a bad knee for the rest of my life. [chuckles] Okay, you are definitely a horse-ist. [laughs] [shutter clicking] [Logan laughing] What are you laughing at? You. [laughs] I don't know about this. Come on. What's the matter? Me falling off. Come on. I thought you said you weren't scared. Well, I lied. All right. Come on. Just get ready. On three, okay? All right. One, two... [grunting] What are you doing? Looking for your seat belt? [laughs] Oh, okay. You got jokes, huh? What, are three people gonna see that on there? It's 12. [shutter clicks] All right. Don't be afraid, Jordan. I got you. Come on. Whoa. Just hold on. I don't know about this. [Lee] Come on. It's easy. Okay, so, when you ride, every muscle in your legs are gonna be worked. It's gonna slowly break through the scar tissue that's limiting your mobility. You sure old Chief is ready for this? Oh, trust me. He's loving it. I promise. All right. Let's go. Uh... [chuckles] Okay. -Come on. -Come on. I'm a regular old cowboy now. See? Much more fun than PT. Plus, the view is better. The view is outstanding. There we go! Yeah!

Just in case you don't know which way to go. Thank you. Giving jewelry is pretty serious, right? Well, I did work pretty hard for it. So, I guess this means it's finally time to meet your dad? I don't know. He's not too happy about me bringing up how he gambled away my college money. Oh. It's just not the right time. It's never a good time. I can't do anything about that. We're from two different worlds. But I thought we were gonna make our own little world. I'll see what I can do. Okay. Hey, Pop. Hey. You smell like a barn. You've been spending an awful lot of time at the Grove's place. Yeah. They're helping me out with my knee. They, or that girl? Don't start with me, Pop. Oh, so, you got you a white girlfriend now. I have a girlfriend. Her name is Lee. And I don't care about the color of her skin. Well, I guarantee she cares about the color of your skin. Trust me. I've been around this town too long. People are talking, Jordan, about who did this and who did what between you and them white boys. Well, Lee's different. She's no different. You think you're special? You think she's gonna want a future with you if can't play football, if you can't afford school? You haven't even told her, have you? I didn't think so. The second you don't have some flashy future, she's gonna drop you. You'll see. She's got money, son. Ain't nothing wrong with that. But she ain't gonna wanna be with nobody can't pay for her horses. That's just the way it is. You don't even know her. Because you're ashamed to bring her around your old man, because you figure if she knows your roots, she might not stick around. -I'll bring her by, then. -All right, you do that. I'm sure she's a... she's a nice young lady. Yes, she is. But she's gonna break your heart. She's not Mom. I'm just trying to look out for you, son. You're from separate worlds. Ain't no future for the two of you. Looks like Jordan's all better. Time to get back to work. [cell phone beeps] [Lee] See, whenever you're steering him, if you want him to go this way, you want to pull back towards your hip. Just like that. You never cross over his neck. So, bring him around this way. Good. Now loosen up. [indistinct chatter] [male teacher] Historians have traditionally divided the war into three phases. -Hey. You need any help? -Hey. Yeah. Uh, maybe you could grab a brush. I need to get ready for school pretty soon. Yeah. [Jordan] Oh, yeah. You like that, huh, boy? You look tired. Just what every woman loves to hear. [chuckles] I just worry about you. You know, you've been pushing hard. That's what you have to do to accomplish your dreams. How you doing, Chief? You miss your buddy, don't you? Hey, Lee, have you ever really grieved Casey's death? Yeah. Of course. It just seems like ever since it all happened, you've just been running ragged, you know? I'm fine, Jordan. I don't know why you always keep bringing it up. Okay. Never mind. Prom's coming up, right? Guess so. Do I, like, have to go to that? Or am I too old? Will they let me in? I've never really cared too much about prom, so... Okay, good. I know it doesn't compare... but I was thinking I could invite you over for dinner with my father. Really? Yeah. I think I'm ready. I don't know what'll happen, but... I just want him to realize that we're different. I'm sure I'll love him. And I can make him love me. Come on, come on. Keep up, keep up! Uh-uh. Careful. Good boy. Easy. Good boy. One more time. Come on. [sighs] [Jeff] Looks like you've been training those horses hard. Yep. You still planning on doing that trip? Probably have to delay a month or so, but, yeah, I am. You still gonna ride it alone? Sure am. You know, you, um... you actually proved me wrong. I thought you'd lose interest. Like you did when you were a kid with the tree house. But... you impressed me. Thanks, Dad. Listen, you know, I know I haven't been the best father lately. And you can take this for whatever it's worth. But, um... I just don't want you riding cross-country. Now, listen. You're gonna be out there all by yourself. Going across the country, okay? It's not safe. I don't know if I can handle losing someone else in my family. Can you do that for me? [doorbell rings] Hey. Wow, you look great. Are you ready for this? Yeah. Let's go. [both sigh] Hey! Hey, Pop. This is Jubilee. [laughing] Hi, Mr. Bishop. Wow. You sure have grown up since the last time I last saw you, sitting in the bleachers, watching your brother play football. Yeah. He was a heck of a player. You guys chat. I'm gonna check on the food. Yeah, I spent a lot of time sitting in those bleachers. Yes, you did. [chuckles] Jubilee. Jubilee. You know, my father sang gospel in a jubilee quartet. Really? Mm-hmm. You ever heard of that? That kind of thing? No, I don't think so. Sorry. Ah, no reason you would. -[chuckles] -[knocks] Would you get that for me? Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Kim? Yeah, hi. [Thomas] Hey. Hey. [door closes] What's up, Kim? Uh, your dad said you needed hot sauce for your dinner. Yeah, we're out of hot sauce. Dad, I made chicken Alfredo. Everything goes with hot sauce. Mm-hmm. You like hot sauce? -Sure. -See? See? How about you stay for dinner? You know what, I only made enough for us three, so... [chuckles] Maybe next time. Thanks. [scoffs] Nice necklace. [door opens] Why don't we all sit down. [door closes] And there are so many who have so little. Thank you for this food. Amen. Amen. So, Jubilee, what do you want to do after you graduate? You know, I don't really know. She's going on a cross-country horse trip. Doesn't that take a lot of money? Not once you have the horse. It'd be a lot of money for this family. Not if you do something called saving. Must be nice being able to take all that time off work. Do you have something against riding? No, no. I'm just admiring your privileged life. You should be grateful. [chuckles] Well, I'm not going anymore. What do you mean? It was too much for my dad. Everything I want gets taken from me. [Thomas] Mmm. Yeah. Welcome to our reality, young lady. Well, that's what happened to me. That's what happened to Jordan. That's just ordinary life outside of your ivory castle. Dad. So you think you're the only one with problems? You think that just because my dad makes a decent income that my dreams aren't valid? [inhales] No, you don't get it. [scoffs] Jordan still has hope. He's almost recovered. Not from the concussion. I thought you said that wasn't a big deal. I didn't want you to worry about it. You got enough going on. Dreams can definitely die when white boys jump you because they're jealous of a borrowed car and... your white girlfriend. Dad, it wasn't her fault. [Lee] Jordan. Would you please take me home? I don't think I'm welcome here. Hey. [door lock clicks] [line ringing] Hey, Pop. Think you could get me an introduction with the foreman down at the factory? I can do that. Hey. [sighs] You okay? Yeah. I'm fine. You don't have to lie to me. I know you're not fine. But you can lie to me about your concussion? Why didn't you stand up for me last night? I'm sorry. I didn't know that was gonna happen. But you snapped at a grown man. I'm so sick of people saying that I need to learn this, that I don't get it and I don't understand. And maybe I don't, but I'm trying. Maybe trying's not good enough. Do you really want to go through life having to deal with this all the time? That's your dad talking. Not you. I decided to quit football. Wow. But that's okay. We can figure that out. [sighs] Broken dreams are worth putting back together. I don't know if I believe that anymore. I think we were just being naive. The world doesn't care about our dreams. That's why we have to fight for them. No, I think we were both just going through a whole lot at the time, and we just forced it. No. No, don't do this. Our worlds are just too different. I just don't see a good future for us. This is what's best. For you. Can't I decide what's best for me? I can't believe you're giving up. Just never forget you were one of the best things that ever happened to me. I'm sorry about your ride. [screams] [sighs] [horse nickers] [shutter clicks] So, he was trained for endurance, so he should be able to do anything you need him to do. Okay. How old is he? Fourteen. Fourteen. How long have you had him? Uh, about seven, eight years. Good. All up to date on his shots, I assume? Yes. Yes. There you go. Thank you. I'll come get him in the morning. All right. Sounds good. Bye. Thanks, Lee. [sighs] I did what you said. I sold Casey's horse. [sighs] ["The Light Below" by Zia playing] Come on, buddy.

[Jeff] I just, uh, hope he has a good home. [man] Yeah. My kids are gonna love him. Thank you very much. Bye. Thank you. [Jeff] Be safe. Hey. Hey. Let me know if you need me to tuck you in tonight. -Think I will. -[engine starts] Mr. Bishop. Could you please make sure Jordan gets this? Thank you. Hey. How about giving your old man a shot, huh? No way. Yes way. Your ball. Where'd you get that? I dug it out of the drawer. This is my old one from 1990. Let's go. Come on. You ready for this? I'm ready for this. Let's go, old man. Ah! Dude, you pushed off! Ooh. You like that. Yeah, that's a good one. Why are you always spoiling them? [chuckles] Don't tell anybody, but I'm gonna miss a few of these stinky things. I don't think I'm a horse-ist anymore. I, uh... I got your letter. Good. You sold Chief? Yeah. I did. But it was good for me. I finally did it, you know? Let myself be sad about Casey. That's good. I'm proud of you. Lee, that's a lot of money. I can't accept it. No, it was Casey's. He would've wanted you to be the first in your family to graduate college. And you did that even... even after I ended things. Yeah, well, just because you don't want to fight for us doesn't mean that I can't still love your dreams. Well... it's enough for one year at a state school. If I work hard enough, I can afford the next. And if I get good enough grades, which I plan to... I could earn a scholarship for my master's. You know, statistically speaking, 78% of minorities with a GPA of 3.8 or higher earn full scholarships. Wow. Sounds like the math wiz has a plan. What about you? What do you want to do after you graduate? Guess I'll just stay here. Give lessons, board horses. Hang with Ghost and Cody until I finally figure out what I want to do. Well, I missed enrollment for fall semester. So I have to wait until the spring rolls around. I have some downtime. And I figure there's nothing else I'd rather do than get on a horse for three months and... head towards the Pacific Ocean with you. [both laugh] I missed you. I want to fight for this. Your broken dreams are worth putting back together too. Yes, they are. So, about those toothless mountain men. Oh, my God! You are still scared. I'm just worried. I just think there's power in numbers. That's all I'm saying. Is that too much to ask? Yes.
