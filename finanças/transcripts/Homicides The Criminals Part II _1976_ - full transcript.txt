Well, may be a dead body Don't scare me People these days have no civic awareness Putting things in the middle of the pavement There's no harm moving it away Open it and have a look "Corpse hidden in a carton box" Today's news in Hong Kong This morning at around seven close by Wong Nei Chung Rd. Tram Depot, Happy Valley a shocking murder case was discovered A girl was killed and dumped in a carton box Her name was Qi Xiao Ying a Form three student of a night school She was found dead in nude in a Hitachi TV carton box Move over please... Move over... Court in session Bow This is a very horrible and mysterious case because there's no eye witness at all The murderer seemed to be calm, and has destroyed all evidence after committing the murder Detectives in charge of this case are helpless The point in question is the absence of the motive So now the police can only rely entirely on circumstantial evidence and results of scientific evidence to go ahead with the prosecution There are only two possibilities in this case If there's a reasonable doubt about the case the suspect will have to be released The other possibility is without any doubt in which case the jurors have to reach a consensus Hence the jury would have to bear in mind that this is the first time that scientific evdence is used in a trial That's why special care should be taken Logical thinking must be exercised to analyze the case Your Honour, Members of the Jury Qi Xiao Ying left home at 5:30 PM on December 16 last year Her classmate, Wang, received her phone call at 6:30 PM and they arranged to meet at the Happy Valley tram terminal When Wang arrived she didn't find Qi The following day, which was the morning of December 17 A cleaner found Qi Xiao Ying's dead body inside a carton box This carton box was left on the road outside Ya Mei Company The murderer intended it to be treated as trash to be sent to the incinerator and be burnt Then he would be able to get away with it Detectives in charge of ths case based on the time of death, location and whether the victim made contact with the murderer investigated electrcal appliance shops in Happy Valley and looked into the source of the TV carton 750 people, including the suspect, were questioned, During the 3-month investigation circumstantial evidence were collected and analysed There were altogether 269 items all from the working room behind Ya Mei Company, from the victim and from the carton box which contained the body The fibre particles we obtained from the defendant's suit were are enlarged for reference by the court The police with the strong evidence in hand arrested Situ Bing Jiang on March 27 and charged him with murder I swear... everything I tell in court would be the truth... and nothing but the truth... Situ Bing Jiang I'd like to ask you since when did you start working at the Ya Mei Company? Last August Is Ya Mei Company located close by Wong Nei Chung Rd., Happy Valley tram depot? Yes Tell me about the nature of your work and how you get to and leave work? I work as a clerk at the factory in Kwun Tong After I get off from work from 6 to 10 in the evening I sell ice cream at the Ya Mei Company managing the vending machines and doing some cleaning You start work at 6 o'clock every evening at the Ya Mei Company? No, I usually arrive there by 5:45 PM You leave at ten o'clock every night? No, usually a little after ten, not later than 10:30 What's your routine before & after leaving work? Cleaning up the vending machines count the money put it on the table "London Ice-cream" Then I would go out and turn off the light "Ya Mei" lock up the iron door, take a bus and go home Do you mean you have the key to the ron door? Yes, I do On the night of the murder, what time did you get home? Around... it was after ten, not later than half past ten If you don't believe me the security guard can be my witness When you went home, did you go out again? I don't remember. Even if I did it would be going out to eat with my wife If you don't believe in me, you can ask my wife In Ya Mei Company where exactly is the phone kept? In the loft of the working room If the phone rang, and you were downstairs how could you answer it? Usually it rang for a while before I picked it up You were the only one over at Ya Mei Company then If you answered the phone there would be no one downstairs Weren't you afraid of having an accident? No. Before I went to answer the phone I'd first lock up the door How many doors are there in Ya Mei Company? Two Which is the one to the working room? The second one Just now you said you would lock the door is this safe? Yes Did anyone use your phone? What time are you referring to? During normal working hours Yes but I don't usually allow others to use it Why? You see... I didn't want to have unnecessary trouble Some scumbag might use the excuse for robbery No further questions Situ Bing Jiang, do you know this girl in the picture? I don't Had she been to the Ya Mei Company to buy ice cream? I can't clearly remember Do you consider her pretty? Pretty subjective, I find her so-so On December 16 the nght of the murder what did you do going to and leaving work? Same as usual, I arrived at 5:45 PM and left at 10:30 PM Were there other people there that night? No So you mean you were the only one in the company Is that correct? Yes On the night in question, did she try to use the phone? No, absolutely not I've already said that I wouldn't let anyone use it You lured her upstairs to the loft You tried to rape her but she resisted and you strangled her No, there's no such thing You've made this all up Your Honour, I object to this assumption Your Honour Sustained Your Honour... Jurors I don't know the girl and bore no grudge against her Why would I do such a ruthless thing? Your Honour, I really didn't do it Please believe in me Is this black suit yours? Yes, it's mine On December 16, the night of the murder did you wear this black suit to work? It can't be I bought this for social occasions I only wore it for banquets. Besides my job requires me to clean the vending machine as well as the company, so what I wear is only uniform I also have to... Just answer me "yes" or "no" No This TV carton box was left inside the work room of the Ya Mei Company Have you seen it before? No There were some bruises on Qi Xiao Ying's ears and neck Her face & neck were charged with blood; eyes bloodshot her nails were blue, a sign of asphyxiation Qi Xiao Ying was proved to have been strangled to death The time was last December 16 between 6 PM and midnight Her nternal organs healthy but her nipples were cut Her hymen was found intact and no sign of intercourse Parts of her nipples and pubic hair were burnt Forensics officer Jiang Zhong Hai In your earlier report you recorded the time of death as December 16 at 9 PM Why did you later advance it to 6 PM? Later we found that she was being strangled to death What's the reason for all this? Oh, you see It's judging from the body temperature of the dead Since she was strangled to death and for this reason her body temperature would rise Is it because of some particular need that you had to advance the time of death? Absolutely not According to what you said just now, her pubic hair was burnt by fire or cigarette butts? Neither They'd been scorched by some high-heat apparatus How could you tell? There an obvious part which showed signs of being burnt And according to analysis of her skin cells she was dead before her pubic hair was burnt by the hot apparatus According to the autopsy report there was a serious fight between the dead girl and the murderer The murderer used his right hand and grabbed the dead girl from behind That's why there were bruises on both sides of her neck The dead girl was screaming at that time but the murderer used his left hand to cover her mouth So there were finger marks on both sides of her mouth In about 30 minutes, she was suffocated and passed out and in anotherfive minutes she was dead Let's come to how the victim got into Ya Mei Company Going by the time and place of the murder she'd have requested for the use of the phone there Then he... immediately lured her into the room locked the door, and brought her into the working room Mister, can I use your phone? Use the phone? Miss, we never allow strangers to use the phone Please, I have some urgent business it won't take too long Well... since you are a girl alright then, not for anybody else Thank you Where is it? Upstairs, go up yourself Hello, be there in time to wat for me How come you are so troublesome? Alright, I know you are always late don't let me wat too long Alright that's it, 'bye Stop the noise Scraps of paper, hair, paint found in the working room of the Ya Mei Company match with those found in the carton box The same kind of fibre was also found in the dead girl's hands and nails They match with the material and colour of the defendant's suit The red rubber particles found on the dead girl's hair are those from an electric wire Such an electric wire was also found in the room All the above circumstantial evidence is enough to prove that the dead girl was in the Ya Mei Co room Your Honour A lot of suits have the same kind of material as mne How can you be sure that the fibre are from mine? Besides, in a working room it's not unusual for electric wires and tape etc. To be available So how can you be sure that that dead girl was in the room of the Ya Mei Company? Situ Bing Jiang, what is this? This is a soldering gun from the work room Is there such an apparatus in the working room of Ya Mei Company? Yes On the night of December 16 did you go to the working room? Yes, but... On the night of December 16 Situ Bing Jiang strangled the girl in the working room Stripped her clothes off burnt her pubic hair with this soldering gun You're trying to frame me I've never done such a thing I went to the working room to get some tools to repair the vending machine I didn't touch that soldering gun I really didn't touch it You are lying Your Honour, Jurors This is an extremely cruel murder case This soldering gun was found in the working room of the Ya Mei Company Members of the jury, the forensic officer stressed that the victim's pubic hair was burnt by an apparatus which is this solderng gun Your Honour, there must be solid proof for everything No conclusion may be reached at by mere coincidence Your Honour, the prosecution requests to call a witness to the court Go up I swear that what I say is the truth, nothing but the truth Miss Zhou Has your skirt been burnt by someone? Yes, twice Is he the same person who burnt your skirt twice? Yes Is this person in court? He is here Can you please point him out?

Miss, I'm sorry, it's an accident Look I'm so sorry I'm sorry, Miss You burnt a hole here Look what you've done Why are you burning my skirt? You are crazy Your Honour, no further questions Miss Zhou, have you made up the story about the burning skirt? No, it's true It's been two years since ths happened Can you still recognize that person? Yes, it's him Tell the truth have you been persuaded by someone to be a witness? No Have you ever used cigarette butts to burn Miss Zhou's skirts? No, there's no such thing at all I won't do anything that low The dead girl was brutally tortured before she died I suggest Your Honour and the jurors to visit the site of the murder Alright Your Honour, Members of the Jury I believe you have all looked very carefully This is the soldering gun This is what the murderer used to burn the pubic hair and nipples of the victim The box which contained the girl was placed here before Your Honour Prosecution's strongest evidence against the defendant is that Qi Xiao Ying had asked to use the phone But as per what the friend of the dead girl states is that it was more like a noisy background when she received the call from Qi Xiao Ying This indicates that the place where she was killed could not be the quiet room of the Ya Mei Company Secondly the defendant worked from 6 PM to 10 PM at the Ya Mei Company There were a lot of people either comng from school or from work between 6 PM to 7 PM A lot of people who were waiting at the tram station would get a drink from the Ya Mei Company The defendant could never kill and do business at the same time Thirdly, the autopsy report originally stated the time of death as between 9 PM to midnight and she was dumped into the carton box half an hour after she was dead It's the prosecution who, for the sake of charging the defendant, put the time of murder forward i. E. From 6 PM to midnight This is an important point Fourthly, the two cases about burning skirts are doubtful Why didn't Miss Zhou have the defendant arrested right after the second incident? In fact, I really have some doubts about Miss Zhou's memory Fifthly, until now the prosecution cannot determine the motve of the murder Besides, we've no eyewitness to the incident On the night of the murder, the defendant left Ya Mei Company at 10:30 PM Being a busy street there should be many people around Even if he pulled the carton box out to the street a lot of people would have seen it Sixthly, according to the autopsy there was some food left in the dead girl's stomach The prosecutor could not find out where she might have ate on the way from Shaukeiwan to Happy Valley Receiving her call at 6:30, her friend was supposed to meet her at Happy Valley five minutes after We should note the time element Seventh, the defendant's manager and his female colleagues who had been with him for six years all confirm that he is a hardworking person Polite towards women Moreover, the defendant is married and has a good family He's normal, and doesn't have any bad habits no criminal record Your Honour & Jurors, please judge with perspicacity Your Honour, working at Ya Mei Company for so long I've never been to work in a suit There are really too many coincidences in this case I'm innocent Result of the trial will be announced next Monday Do you think that your husband did that? Please share your views My husband is a good man, he's innocent We have all agreed that Situ Bing Jiang is guilty as charged The court proclaims Situ Bing Jang guilty of murder and is sentenced to death by hanging
