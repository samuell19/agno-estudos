- Get inside... - Let us go! Leave us... Hey... Take her with you. Once you are done with them, we'll dump them in the river. Leave me. Who the hell are you? There is no one around, who has not heard of me... And to let someone go without bashing... Is not this 'Mauli's' style. Generally, people run the moment they see me enter. Since, you have decided to stay back... I promise to not disappoint you. When a girl is educated progress is assured... And when a boy is not educated... He turns into a local goon. Can I teach them a few lessons? Sure! Let's start with History. When someone misbehaves with a lady... We thrash them right there. That was my History lesson. Now the second one... Mathematics lesson. If a single brick can break 8 teeth... How many teeth can be shattered with 2 bricks? Sixteen! Thirty-two. Let me show you. Now let's learn a 'Marathi' lesson. Let's start with idioms. Once bitten, twice? Shy! And... they will fly! Be your own bodyguard... Here, take this brick. If you find someone misbehaving with you. Just smash it on his head. - Sure. - If someone questions you. Jus say, 'Mauli' is in me. How is the idea? Simply superb! Everyone knows it. Hey, wait... Greetings! Greetings! Hey... what are you up to? She is the one who told me... to colour you, the moment I see you. She is back again for the 'Holi' celebrations. (Festival of colours) "On this beautiful Holi celebrations day..." "Where are you off to my dear?" "On this beautiful Holi celebrations day..." "Where are you off to my dear?" "Show me some love, I am the one with super swag." "Tag me as your lover." "Show me some love, I am the one with super swag." "Tag me as your lover." "Now don't be upset dear..." "This colour will go off," "once you wash your sari with 'Surf'(Detergent)." "Why are you angry my dear?" "Here, I say sorry!" "Let's play with colours and" "post a story on your 'Instagram'." "I spent some money..." "To get some eco-friendly colours." "Even Krishna and Gopika will make this hash-tag trend." "Now cheer-up and do not wipe your colours," "Splash the remaining colours on me." "Now cheer-up and do not wipe your colours," "Splash the remaining colours on me." "Now don't be upset dear..." "This colour will go off," "once you wash your sari with 'Surf'." "Just stop for some time..." "Let me tell you something." "This continuous dancing is burning my calories." "Everyone around is like a king here..." "They are my dear friends." "Now that they are here to celebrate with me." "And the DJ has stopped playing music." "I will simply now, shout..." "And you do not doubt... "Kindly give me your lovely pout, right now..." "I will simply now, shout" "And you do not doubt..." "Kindly give me your lovely pout, right now..." "Now don't be upset dear..." "This colour will go off," "once you wash your sari with 'Surf'." Hey Mauli. Where are you off to? Do you think, you are my only priority? I am done with this... Now I have some other task to attend. We have reached 'Kaapur' village... Money? No I don't want... We have reached 'Kaapur' village... Very tasty tea... The taste of Kerosene was amazing. Hey you free-loader... pay for the tea... I have a 15 rupee note, will get some change and pay you soon. - I'll get you change - Or else take a 30 rupees note tomorrow. Oh! a cop, here? - Greetings! - Greetings... Come, let's go! Are you okay to ride this? Of course... What's wrong in that? Let's go. Okay... I don't mind. Where are you from? This village... I can be seen here, there... everywhere. Yesterday the bus went over me. I escaped death, very narrowly... I was sitting under the bridge and the bus went over the bridge. I got lucky! You arrived at your destination. May I take your leave? Didn't he hear what I said? May I take your leave? Sure! Give me whatever you feel like. Either a 20 rupee coin or a 40 rupee note. And I will dismiss this case... A cop like you is asking for a tip? I am not a cop sir, I am just a street artist... My name is 'Kadaknath Kalele' I have just one demand, stop defecating in public. Okay... pay me quick. It's my father-in-law's wedding, on 32nd of this month, I have made some salted sweets... Have fried some Indian bread in kerosene. I made some bright white soap rice too... All guests will surely enjoy. Oh I see... Tell me something more about this village. Villagers are mute, The village deity is a mere guard. Pilgrims get subsidy, drunkards get hand-cuffed... Water is available 24x7, but criminals get jailed... You have a job, but you will be jobless. Where do I park this? Why do you ask me? Is it not yours? He already started questioning before the theft. Theft rate goes up when cops are around. I will take your leave. What about this? The rightful owner will take it. Glad it had some fuel in it... No, it's not that, Sayyed... Working as a cop is simpler... But, playing cards at work is tough. If you lose the game today, your wife will make you starve. Shut up! don't remind me of her. Your turn! Let me explain... deal the Jack of spade... Who the hell are you to instruct me? idiot! This idiot... ... is the new in-charge of this place. Sir, my name is Sayyed... This is Mr. Salunke, this is constable Rane... And he is our senior most cop Mr.Bhanudas Thupe. I am 'Inspector Mauli Sarjerao Deshmukh' I have completed 6 years of service... This is my third posting. I worship my duty... And I treat criminals as humans... I have never let a case go out of my station... I believe... Police men are meant to solve problems... and not to create one. If you say so! This is of no use to me... He is one amongst us. I am fine with your behaviour... But no more playing cards in front of 'Bapu'. Oh! Sayyed! Move 'Bapu's' picture out of this room. Sir, he is the only one who can adjust with us. Sir, this is for you... How much do I owe you? Sir, please help... What's the matter? Just look at her... Hey, hold on... Ma'am what's the matter? You may ask... Ask this entire village... Who is the one to sell the authentic spices? Renuka! Oh! Who do you think gave him and his brother my spices to sell? Renuka! Who caught him red handed adulterating my spices? Renuka? Very impressive. Sir, If I lose my spices I will get it back... What if I lose my trust? Be it spices or humans... This Renuka can spot the genuine and fake... Fake products can never match up the real one. I will bash you black and blue... Hold on. I will teach him a good lesson. Hey... aren't you a responsible citizen... As per IPC Section 272, I can imprison you for 6 months, with a fine up to Rs.1000. Now... Arrest him right away. Else I will whip him in front of all. Ma'am... Let me explain... If you punish him... You will be at loss. People will come to know about the adulteration. You will lose business. And eventually you will have to shut shop. Just think about it... 'Anger' is one letter short of 'Danger'. Do you agree, Thupe? You are right sir... I received the same quote this morning. Quite possible... Okay... forget it... Be kind and forgive him... Forgive me please, sister. Go, say sorry. Forgive me please, sister. I will never repeat this, ever. See, what I had to go through because of him. Very impressive. Come on, pick it up! Dharma... Will they listen to us? Who cares? We will stick to our guns. Who are they to decide? Okay... see you later. Hey! Uncle! He is fine now... You come with me. Sir! A water-tanker driver knocked him down, I witnessed it. I saw 'Blessings of Hanuman' graphics on the tanker. People were just watching. Not a single person came forward to help. Then I brought him here. You are so kind... That's the need of the hour. Kindly lodge my complaint. You may go to the outskirts of this village. All water tankers are parked on a ground there. I will look into it. Thupe! You wait here... Record his statement when he wakes up. I will go and enquire. Sayyed, let's go. [Men playing Kabbadi] Sir, are you sure? [Men playing Kabbadi] Who was driving this tanker with 'Blessings of Hanuman' on this? He is the new guy in our village. That's him... What's the matter? He knocked a pedestrian, he is expected to visit us for an enquiry. We are busy with our game... Let him come for an enquiry... If he is not guilty we will let him go. He can't come... go to hell... If he doesn't come, I may have to step in... Oh... sure... Come just touch him... and he is yours... Let me explain... Now that you have stepped into our court... Let's play for a while. Come dear... Touch him! If you ever try to show off your power and position. I swear I will strip you... ...and bash you up in front of everyone. It's not as easy as you think. You are new to this location... It's not too easy to get everyone under control. You need to evaluate the situation. Okay... forget it. Thankfully they spared you today. And that man Mr. Dharma Pawar, he is too over-smart. Hey, you... Don't you feel ashamed of yourself? His wife mentioned, it's not a mere accident... It's a property issue... And this guy took bribe from him. Hey... It's not just my money... My boss too has a share in it. What? My share? Yes of course. Oh! that explains... Now I know... Every cop posted in this village changes in a day. And you showed your true colour a little too soon. Put up your rate-card here and make it an official business. And you call yourself 'Inspector Mauli'? You are disgusting. Everyone is just the same. Sir, this is your share... This is just the beginning... Open the gate! [Men playing Kabbadi] Allow us to fill water We have been waiting since 2 hours. Atrocities of these goons will not be tolerated. Atrocities of these goons will not be tolerated. So... you back again? I have realized... to beat someone in their own field has its own kick. I heard someone's pot crash... Oh gosh! What I heard yesterday seemed so unreal... What I am seeing today looks real... How did a bomb blow out of a small fire cracker? Move aside... In the future if someone asks for your maker's name. Tell them, it's... 'Inspector Mauli Sarjerao Deshmukh'. A cop like me is in control till the time I am in my uniform. The moment this uniform is off, I am the biggest terror you shall ever encounter. Remember, from now... whenever you see me... You have to salute... And say "Hello sir," "what can I do for you?" Hello sir... what can I do for you? This is how... a strict cop takes action. Arrest him! Hey come... Very impressive... Hey... do not stare at my moustache. It's real... oh Almighty." Oh Lord, you punished one to be a stillborn... ... and you blessed the other with life. Aren't they both your children, then why do you discriminate? Oh Lord Panduranga... You are our protector. Where there is cloud, there is rain... Where there is a river, there is water... Where there is a tree, there is shade. Where there are children, there is Mauli (Mother). Looks like he is born to protect his brother... They are blessed kids. Hey dear... ... what about their father, where is he? He is dead. Everything is gone... I see a dark future for myself. There will be utter darkness during our journey. But the almighty will light-up our way. The one to gives rise to questions... Is the one to provide answers to all our questions. Now, you may have several doubts. I am a single mother, new to this place. How am I going to raise these kids single-handedly? Only Lord Pandurang can help me... Saint Tukaram had answered this many years ago. We are the devotees of Lord, we follow him blindly. We don't differentiate between anyone, we are all one and the same. We may have different bodies, but we have the same soul. Whatever be your problem... Mauli is the answer to everything. You may have different bodies, but your vision will be the same... Mauli. We devotees of Lord Pandurang, wherever we meet each other... ...how do we address one another? - Mauli! - Exactly... Which is the word that can transform a person into a devout pilgrim? Mauli! Mauli is the one to guide you through every darkness of your life. Mauli! Mauli! They both will share the same name... 'Mauli'. How do I look? Super! Boys! Who intends to go to school today? The Mauli dressed in shirt, or the one without? Let him go... As it is, our teacher will be asking us to recite multiplication tables. Brother... you go today. Our financial condition forces me take this decision, dear. You are two different individuals for me, but for the world, you will have to live like one... ...only then we can survive. Let's have some fun... Hey... please don't hit me... please don't hit me... Where is he going? I looked for you all around, and here you are... I got bashed up in the school... If you get scared of getting beaten up, you can never be successful in life. Okay... tomorrow is my turn to visit school, in full form. Why so? Because, tomorrow is my turn to give it back. Mauli! No bloody fights... Bloody, no fun. from now... whenever you see me... You have to salute... And say "Hello sir," "what can I do for you?" What did I say? Hello sir! what can I do for you? Hello sir! what can I do for you? Hello sir! what can I do for you? Hello sir... Please come over... What can I do for you? Hello sir... Please come over... Hello sir! what can I do for you? I hope the injury is not too bad? Me? No, not you, I meant those guys, you bashed. Nope... I just touched them. So now, do you want to treat them? You wait, I will check. Careful... Oh! there she is... back to stare at my moustache. What is it? I have got some spices for you. So? Earlier when we met at my shop, we had some misunderstanding. Did we? Also, I soiled your uniform. Oh uniform? So I decided to get some special spices for the special cop. Come on in... This indeed is your special cop's home...! You never mentioned anything about this babe. Who are you talking about? The spices girl. She is waiting outside. Oh! You were never so thrilled to see me... Hi there... You changed so soon? What? I mean your clothes... I felt little awkward to wear such clothes in front of a lady. It looked so good on you. You feel so? I couldn't get your face out of my head. What amazing stunt you performed. And your masculine moustache spiced it all up so well. Will you please twirl your moustache once for me? We are not supposed to twirl moustache at night... ...it results in hair fall. Oh, is it so? Yes! Okay! Also, I wanted to tell you... I pounded you in front of everyone, for no reason. Now you are used to pound spices, so that's fine. No, nothing like that... I thought you are like 'Goda Masala' (Maharashtrian spice blend) But you turned out like 'Kala Masala'.(Hot and spicy blend) Oh! what's the difference? You find it out. When I saw you fight in the market. It was like I discovered something special in a coal mine... I have never been to a coal mine. I meant, it was like discovering a diamond in a coal mine. It was like spotting a lone tiger amidst pack of wolves. That was my pressure cooker, I guess. Do let me know if you need more. Spices I meant... I saw a spark in her eyes... She called me a 'Tiger'... She doesn't know... there are two tigers... one that eats grass... ...and the one that hunts. Greetings! Hello sir! What can I do for you? Oh! you are quite injured. Sir, you've bashed us... Didn't I just touch you? Okay! Sometimes I lose my cool, in a fit of rage It's perfectly fine. Okay... Tell me your names. Note it down! Dharmaraj alias Nana Londhe. I have been living in this village since last 15 years. My network is spread across this region. My business is not mere a business, its my pride... If someone attempts to ruin my reputation, I will not hesitate to kill that person. I am here to meet the boss. Take your seat... Give me the phone. I can't accept gifts... It's for your official work... So you get proper mobile network in my area. Samba... He is my dog... Who did he bite the other day? - It was me... - Yeah... Sometimes he feels he owns the house that he guards... That's when... We cover his face with a black cloth, tie him to our vehicle and... drag him all around the village. It almost kills him... But he should know, he is just a watch dog... He shouldn't act like the owner. Keep it there... This is my 'Kaapur' village. These are my liquor dens, This here is my water-tanker business... Land development... Here... on this land... I will be setting up the first distillery. The first one in this region. All of these belong to me. You are here to just guard it... I will rule it... So stay in your limits. Tupe, if he claims all of these to be under him... What area comes under our jurisdiction? It's simple from this table to our main gate. Tupe says, this village is Nana's homeground... I expected this to be a quiet village when I was transferred here. Silence in the woods... means there are dangerous beasts dwelling inside. We don't have to worry... In two years I will be Transferred out of this place. You haven't changed a bit... You still can't tolerate any crease on your uniform. No cop can tolerate any crease on his uniform. Then how do you tolerate such injustice in this village? Let me do a round of this village... I want to see to what extent Can this beast go to. Sir, did you recognise me? Hello sir! I met you when you First came to this village? Why the hell is he trying to get so close? Sir please keep me with you... Hey... I don't have any such vices. Sir, please hear me out. I wanted to be a real cop like you... But I ended up becoming a fake constable. Yesterday, after seeing you bash up the goons. I felt, if an outsider like you is protecting this village. Let me at least be of some assistance to you. I can be your informer. Please accept my services. If not a constable, at least hire me as a 'Commissioner of police'. Is it? and should I twiddle my thumb? Listen to me please. You straightened Nana's water-tanker gang. that is commendable. Now people of this village Get water frequently. But I will respect you more, if you put an end to this mess. What are you talking about? A liquor shop in front of the temple? Nana's illegal empire is connected to this place. He was a small-time goon in Pandharpur. He worked for a liquor seller and was very short-tempered. One day he killed his boss and falsely implicated his friend in the crime. And moved in here with all his loot. He started his liquor shop, right in front of our temple. This infuriated the local boys. Shantai's son Dinu and his friends shattered Nana's shop. In the brawl Dinu slashed Nana's face. But Nana's ego was hurt. That same here the villagers had Decided to reinstate the village deity. While lighting the lamp-tower, Nana hacked Dinu to death, in front of everyone. Shantai saw her son die Right in front of her eyes. Nana warned the entire village... If anyone attempts to light even a single lamp of the lamp-tower. The entire village will be set on fire. The temple has been shut since then. Our deity is banished outside the temple. And every villager here is in fear. After Dinu's death, Shantai vowed, That she will never enter the temple, Until God decides to come and end this evil. That's why she makes one garland everyday Waiting for her Lord to arrive. The entire village was Thrown into darkness by Nana... But she is the only flame of hope, Burning.. Right outside this temple. We are so fortunate to have you in this village. Hence I urge you, to ban Nana's illegal activities. And clear this mess. Your duty is about to begin... I came here to help my brother... But I am going stay back for the village. Sir, what are you doing here? Just... I came to attend the fair. Oh, is it? Sir, Mr. Dharma Pawar... Please don't. I think you are the only one who treats a farmer with respect. I heard about the fight in the market. You have come like our god, our savior. God? No... let me be a simple human being. Is everything alright with you? I had saved some money to buy fertilizers, I had to use that for my medical expense. But that's ok. What you did boosted my morale. From now on you have our house That you can call home in this village May I take your leave? Let's go. Is there anyone who can hit the bulls-eye? Three rounds for just 10 rupees. Is there anyone who can hit the bulls-eye? Come! Now! I am sure you are an expert at this. Hey, give it to him. He will hit the bulls eye in one go. No! I heard about Nana's visit at the police station. But... what was the purpose? What did he say? He apologized for his mistakes. He must've sensed your strength. Our bullets are bigger may be that's why I am unable to. Here... take it. Go for another round please. Hey reload the gun. No, I feel you should let it go. You don't even have to pay me. Hey shut-up and reload. Okay! Sir, try one more time. Here, sir... Please. Hit the balloons please. Earlier, I called you 'corrupt', that triggered you, right? Tell me the truth. Did my words have that impact on you? Tell me... Tell me... Oh God! Perfect aim! Very impressive. "Be bold and come to me dashingly." "Come over to my place dressed like a groom." "Go on your knees and propose to me, oh my love." "I will surely come, and surprise you." "...and propose to you at your doorstep." "When I do so, do get a bit shy and coy, my dear." "This grace of yours, I have never seen..." "and I get lost in this beautiful moment." "I don't care about the world." "When I lose myself in the beauty of your eyes." "Don't give the same old excuses." "Get lost, I don't want to hear it again." "I have fallen head over heels for you." "So don't let me yearn for you more." Hey, unload it... Kadaknath reporting sir... Yeah... tell me. The consignment has reached here. So what do I do? Sir, you wanted me to inform you about it. What? When did I say that? Sir, please recollect... Oh! Yeah... I did mention that to you. So where do I come? To the temple lane, sir. Okay... you wait for me. - I will be there soon. - Yes sir, over and out... You all wait here... I will handle it alone. Good you confiscated this vehicle. Yes of course... This is the only way to recover from the defaulters. It's quite simple... Okay let's get a garland... Do not touch my garland, keep it back. Leave my hand, you old hag. Don't you understand? I said put it back... - Just let me go, you old hag. - Put it back. Aren't you ashamed of yourself, to misbehave with an old lady... How dare you touch me, nobody touches this 'Bhairavnath'. Hey... what are you guys waiting for? Smash this shop to pieces. I am going to shove each one of you, like a sugar cane into this grinder... And pull your pulp out from the other end. Hey, take down my order... One full glass, one half... one jumbo... and one with ice in it. Oh Lord Vithal... I waited for you all these years... Here you are... And in this form... Oh Lord... Go and tell everyone. Liquor is banned from now on in this village. I swear I will ban liquor in the entire region. I, Mauli Sarjerao Deshmukh swear by my words. I will reinstate our Lord back in his temple. If someone has the guts to stop me, they can try their might. Nana... Nana... There is a problem... The inspector has shut our liquor shop. He has confiscated our possessions. He shut our shop in front of everyone. And he re-opened the temple doors. He will ban liquor is what he said. He has announced to reinstate the deity. I underestimated his might... He proved me wrong. Now to get a grip on villagers, we need to set an example in front of them. Why don't you slaughter him now? Not now... I will do it in front of everyone. The thrill to flash our power... ...in front of the entire village... Has its own kick. Wow... it's beautiful. People say that, a divine person like you, can transform every village into 'Pandharpur'(Holy place). Oh! Renuka... I have something to confess... Please tell me. No... Sister... Yes... Let me explain. Once you reinstate our deity... you will become a public figure... you will get busy with all social activities. We will lose contact owing to your busy schedule. Very impressive... That's why please tell me What you have to say now, Mauli... Renuka... The 'Mauli', who is protecting this village is not... Sir... here our mobiles don't get proper network. And you are creating more issues by reinstating the village deity. I came to remind you... You bashed up my water-tanker drivers... You didn't stop there... ... you bashed up my liquor shop boys too. You seized my possessions... Banned liquor. And now you are planning to reinstate the deity. You displayed your power... We can't just wait and watch. Hence, here I am to show you a bit of my strength. So you wanted to reform this village? Try getting up first... Treat him like 'Samba'. Start it. Mauli... He is not just my brother... He is my life... And you dared to take my life away! Hey get up... To hell with these local goons. Having a few dogs around doesn't make him any powerful. Remember... they can break our bones... But not our will... Get up... Look into their eyes and tell them... When you stand in front of 'Mauli'... bow your head down in respect. and shove your tails between your legs. Thanks for reminding me who I am... This local goon has hacked you in front of these villagers. And I have sent back your pride and strength both to your Lord Vitthal. From here on, in this village... 'Mauli' the name, will not evoke devotion. It will spread fear. Brother... Brother... Brother... Brother, are you okay? No! Sir, your loss is very unfortunate... I have been praying to the almighty... ... to get you out of this situation at the earliest. Which God are you talking about? The one I worshiped has left me and gone forever. "Life is helpless, and sky is pouring relentlessly." "Your door is shut, whom should I ask for help." "My spirit is drained, I feel so lost." "I am devastated, recovering is not possible." "Will you come back to me, and eradicate this darkness?" "Life is helpless, and sky is pouring relentlessly." Your father wanted you both... ... to be a policeman, just like him. This uniform will protect him... And your father's belt is for you. Mother! Your buttons are all messed up... Oh gosh! Sorry. "Will you come back to me, and eradicate this darkness?" "Life is helpless, and sky is pouring relentlessly." Your door is shut, whom should I ask for help." "I have lost my path..." "I want you back." "My destiny was entwined with yours." "This sadness is killing me." "There is no one to protect me, from this fire burning around me." Mother! You please lie down... "The bond is severed, only your memories are with me." What's wrong with you dear? Please speak to us mom... What's happening to you? Promise me, you both will live like one soul. You will never abandon each other... ever. Mauli promise me, ...you will always protect your brother no matter what. Mauli! Mauli! Mom! Mom! Sir! Please come in... I am here to warn you... What? If you don't repay your debt in next two days... Your land will be seized... This is Nana's order... But why are you playing his messenger? Hey... it's very simple... Sir is on our side. Now I know... Go tell Nana, it's not possible to repay in two days. I need to reap and sell my crop to earn money... I need minimum 8 to 10 days... I am helpless... I will have to forcefully throw you out. Dharma! Please don't force me to resort to this action. Okay, you go ahead... Let me see who throws me out of my house. Get out... You go inside. Good job... I am glad you joined us... I wish you had shown such loyalty earlier... Then your brother would've been alive. I would like to reward you for your loyalty. Here, take this... Please take it... You will need it to pay For your brother's last rites. Check that out... my picture... Isn't it very royal? This square is my homeground... and this distillery will be like the capital of my kingdom. I swear I will spread my liquor business In the entire state, that's my promise. Renuka, I need to speak to you... You are too late now... Please leave this village... What's the purpose of leading such a life? Nana has threatened me... What? If I leave this village, he will not spare anyone here... I lost my brother while reforming this village. Where do I go from here? So, do you intend to go through this torture? I have to get used to this... I don't have a choice... Earlier I did bear it for my sake Now I will bear it For this village. Will this self torture do any good to this village? If you think so, then you are wrong. You may leave now... Sir! [People wailing...] Uttam... Dharma's farm is on fire... I need a water-tanker urgently... Hey... look... ...how desperate he is... I need a water-tanker urgently to extinguish the fire. Do you want a tanker? Is this your father's property to claim ownership? Get out! Sir, I beg of you... Kindly give me one water-tanker to extinguish the fire... Do you want water? Yes! Hey, give it here.. Here gulp it down... and I will give you water... What are you staring at? God drank poison to save People from death... can't you drink just one bottle of alcohol? Come on, have it. Have it. You can do it... Have it... Bottoms up... You have to finish it up. That's nice... Give him some water. Hey... We are the one to set the fire, how can you come to us asking for water? Have you lost it? Here, take this... Go extinguish the fire... I thought you are omnipresent. I thought I will find you here. So, I came here looking for you. I have worshiped you all my life... Today, I need an answer from you... Every single person in that village thinks... You are here inside their temple.. They struggled for over 15 years to re-open that temple door. And gave their life for it. Now I feel... ... it's good your temple doors were never opened. They would've discovered... ...your non-existence. You give with one hand... And take away from the other... You took away my father... You gave me my mother... Then you took away my mother... And you gave me a brother... When I needed him the most, you snatched him away... You never gave me the strength to fight... You also took away my spirit to face difficult situations. Every insect and bird is blessed with an instinct to protect themselves... Why have you not given me any strength? I am here to tell you... Your temple may stand here forever... But no one will ever believe in you from hereon. I have lost everything I had... There is only darkness That's left behind. How do we live in this darkness? Can you please tell me? Brother! Sir, some villager spotted you entering the temple. To protect you from Nana's goons... ...I had to bring you here. How many more dead do you want to see? Do you think your silence will safeguard this village? This is the result of you keeping quiet. Remaining silent is not going to help anyone. Everyone knows the real mind behind the fire breakout. I wish to remind you that, you too are responsible for this. And you will have to Pay for it one day. Keep moving... Keep moving... Hey show me the money... You are responsible for the fire at Dharma Pawar's field... You confessed yesterday... Of course... I did... What the hell are you going to do about it? Get out of here... You idiot! Hey, throw him out of here... You go... I will handle him. Mr. Deshmukh... You are out to ruin my reputation. Your fists are not meant to just crush onions? Time to show your strenght. Looks like he is still high from yesterday's drinking... Hey, give him a dose... There is not a single brick on earth that can hurt 'Mauli'. Come... Hey leave me... Let me go... Hey, have you lost it? Do you know who you are dealing with? Have you lost your mind? Hey what are you doing inside? Hey you locked me up here... Brother... Hey what are you Doing there? Sir, of course I will enter from the door, and not the window. So, Mr. Deshmukh... As kids I used to seek you. Now you know where I am hiding, yet you fail to know where I am... There you are... Brother, what is going on? How did you come back? Please speak up! I had given my word to our mother... To protect you always, so here I am. What is this? Magic... or an illusion? Consider this an association, that's all... How did I fight them? I don't have the strength to do so. Wood is never aware of it's capacity. Till a small spark can sets it on fire. You have my spark in you... Today, you showed it ... All I know is, you saved me today. I would've got crushed under the bricks. I wanted to tell you much earlier... Mr. Deshmukh... But since we were busy fighting, there was no time for dialogues. You saved me this time... What about the future? We fought them with our fists... Now its' time to use our heads. What do you mean? We got Bhairavnath today... Half the battle is won... Rest... Brother... I hope you are with me. If you believe in me... I will always be there with you. Hey, get up... Let me explain... I will ask you to confess, You will deny... Nana will come to your rescue... And I will have to let you go. Nothing of that sort will happen now... I have spent 6 years now doing this duty. It's finally time to use my service revolver. Hey... Come out... Hey Tupe! Hey Tupe! I will shoot you right in the middle of the village. Get inside! Have you lost it? Hey... what are you up to? Let's discuss... Hey Tupe... Get down. Are you planning to kill me here? Sir, have you lost it? How can I dare to kill you? So why did you get me here? To clear some misunderstandings... I lost my senses in a fit of rage. Are you crazy? I have no clue why I behaved so weird. Please be kind enough and forgive me. Okay! I request you not to inform Nana about this. He will treat me like his dog 'Samba'. Please... Okay... I won't tell him. Brother. Please do not inform Nana. He gets only the information that I pass on to him. It's that simple. You leave now. Stitch something that will suit my pride. 17 and half... You wanted to see me? Where were you yesterday? Your cell-phone was switched off too. Did you go out of our coverage area? Nothing like that. Come over here. That inspector had jailed me last night. Okay...Nana Get his measurements too. Why me? Let him or should I volunteer? Okay go ahead. You are my most trusted. So why did he arrest you? There was some misunderstanding. He is a crazy guy. You don't bother. Still, I am sure there is something fishy. Nothing sir. I believe you blurted out that we were behind the fire incident. Didn't you? You forced him to booze, he bashed you up... he jailed you... only... to release you later? For no reason? Yeah... I was confused by his behavior too. But he just let me go. I swear I didn't say anything. How dare you attempt to ruin my reputation? I won't repeat it ever. I will never let you repeat it, ever. Note it. His neck measures 16. What's that? Come on in... We need to go. Where? To the factory. Nana wants to meet you. He has not been receiving my phone calls since morning. Is he upset? Nothing like that. May be he was busy? So do you think I am sitting idle here? I work for him, yet he doesn't value my loyalty. You are wrong. What nonsense! Thupe... My confessions will ruin his empire... I know him inside out. Exactly, for that very reason, Nana felt he should not take any risk. What do you mean? If you try to go against Nana, you will not be spared... It is as simple as that. They are 8 men after him... What will he do now? That's the difference between us dear. You count the people, I count my victims. Let's go Mr. Deshmukh... It's time to get physical with them... Twirl your moustache and get ready. He doubted my loyalty... It's stupidity to stay loyal to a cheater. I have done everything for him. I was the one to raise the army of men. I stole the government funds and created a Tanker lobby for him. I helped him to set up his liquor shop. I also set fire to Dharma Pawar's field to make space for his distillery. You set his field on fire and he committed suicide. No he didn't commit suicide. He was murdered. Nana murdered him... right in front of my eyes. I witnessed it all. And today he doubts my integrity. And if Nana doubts anyone's integrity, then it's the end for that person. You record your statement. I will finish his empire for good. Mr. Thupe... you did a great job today. Sir, I supported these criminals all my life. Today I felt like safeguarding our law, from these criminals. Let us show Nana his real place. And you don't worry about this guy. Sir, why have you got me here? You wanted to be a real cop for a day, didn't you? Yes! So, it's your day today... We are here to clear this garbage all by ourselves. Put on your cap. Now he will know, how an honest cop can shatter a local goon's pride. Stop this nonsense. I have a warrant to arrest you. Is it? You may go now, come back tomorrow. Is it so? You have killed someone to grab this piece of land. We have gathered proof for it. Also... I have broken your liquor shop to pieces. We have seized your illegal liquor dens. Your illegal water-tanker business is also shut from today. I will follow the rules and regulation. You may try your influence. If you try to safeguard him, your names will appear with this criminal too. Keep that in mind and act. You came here to inaugurate this land... and your own homeground doesn't exist any more. Come, it's 'Jail time'. Go get my bail. I will be out of the prison in just 2 hours. Let me explain... I will arrest you now. Your men will go to the local court. They will take an hour and half. The court will be shut by then. It's the weekend from tomorrow. You will spend the next two days inside the prison. And in these two days, I will destroy the rest of your businesses. It is impossible... I will never let it happen. Hey... what are you guys looking at? I don't use it, doesn't mean, I don't know how to use it. I will shoot his head off if anyone even moves. Come! After all these years, I will reinstate the village deity back in the temple. From now, our Lord will rule this village. "Lord Vitthal is earth, water and the universe."

This is my place, only I will rule here. Forever! It's been 15 years now... People who spoke against me, are all buried here... Is there someone? Someone... who has the guts to light up a lamp in this lamp-tower? Not a single one! Demolish this place. Please stop... No... sister, if we get scared of him today. This darkness in our lives will never be expelled. Go! Hey get up... To hell with this local goon. Having a few dogs around doesn't make him any powerful. Mauli is the answer to all our questions. You may have different bodies, but your vision will be the same. They can break your bones... But not your will... Brother... will you be with me? If you believe? I will be there for you always Look into their eyes and tell them... When you stand in front of 'Mauli'... bow your head down in respect, and shove your tails between your legs. When you stand in front of 'Mauli'... bow your head down in respect, and shove your tails between your legs. I will finish the terror you have spread before finishing you. You may try as hard as you can... But today my courage will remain unbroken.
