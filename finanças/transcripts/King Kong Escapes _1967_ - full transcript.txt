(ROARING) (ROARING CONTINUES) (MACHINE BEEPING) (MACHINE BEEPING) Lieutenant! Good morning. Boy, with a good-looking nurse like that on board, I wouldn't mind running a fever. Just remember, sailor, I've got lots of castor oil in sickbay. And you, too. Yes, sir... Ma'am. Lieutenant! Thanks. Oh, a gorilla. Are we going to make surveys of animals on this trip, too, Commander? No, this is just for our own amusement. This has nothing to do with our report to the UN. Well, I don't see how you can be amused by gorillas. I think they're dull. Well, this one is 60 feet tall. What do you think of him? 60 feet? (LAUGHING) That's right. This is Kong. The strongest living creature on Earth. Oh, yes, I remember. A legend. And yet, underlying that old legend is some truth. Are you saying that Kong is not just fictional? Yes, I'll show you. I've devoted a good many years to research on Kong. Data I've obtained shows that a giant anthropoid had lived on an island in this area. It still may be there. It may. See this picture? Right here. These are steps from some ancient stone ruins. I thought so, too, when I first saw it. But those steps are each 10 feet high. No human can climb that high in one step. What do you think, Commander? What I'm trying to figure out is... Who built it? And for what purpose? Do the islanders really think this was done by a giant ape? The natives of the Java Sea most definitely believe in Kong. And, Susan, look at this tunnel. This is also Kong's work. Which island is it? The island is Mondo. Right there. Just a little way off our course. CDR. Nelson, take us there for a look. Sorry, we have no time to spare. We're hereto seek oil, you know. We have our orders from the United Nations Research Council. I wish there were some way, but... DR. WHO: He's exactly like the original Kong. With this, the world is ours. (GRINNING) It's still not the original. You sure you just didn't build a giant toy? A toy? That's an insult. How can you say that? It is the strongest thing there is in the world today. Need I remind you how I feel about that? How does it help my government get Element X? DR. WHO: This robot can do anything I program. You can see that I had it constructed exactly as Carl Nelson planned it. This man, Nelson, is interesting. Will you get on to the point? Most certainly. The giant Kong was Nelson's model. This famous scientist researched the legend and he reconstructed the strongest creature on Earth. You stole it. Mmm-hmm. I took his drawings and my genius translated them into a robot Kong that can certainly do anything the original Kong would have done. That ego is showing again. Remember, my country buys results. Doctor, we do not underwrite your precious ego. I quite understand. I shall soon let my Kong show you that he can certainly do the job. Obtain Element X, Dr. Who, and you succeed. My government insists you succeed. You understand that? I do, Madame. We are all ready to start. You'll observe my creation doing now what's never been done. (MACHINE HUMMING) We'll go outside. MAN: 42,000. Mark! The rays of Element X are strong. You are aware the entire world has unearthed the total of only three ounces of this rare element. No one could mine, until now, this crater. Down there is a deposit of tons. DR. WHO: My robot Kong is in position. After all these years of labor, success has come. He will bring out 10,000 tons of X, this robot. We are ready, Doctor. Test results? Excellent, sir. Shortly, your country is going to gain nuclear domination of the universe. America and the Soviets can never catch up. Shouldn't we count on this taking years, Doctor? A hundred days, Madame. That soon'? Element X is unparalleled. You'll create a nuclear arsenal fast. I predict you'll rule the entire world in time. This is an historic day. It's quite a treasure you turned up at the North Pole, huh? Shall we get underway? All right, you may start. Right. (MECHANICAL HUMMING) (THUDDING) (THUDDING) (EXPLOSION) That robot is extraordinary. The real Kong couldn't do what it can. What's happened? It's nearly there now. (THUDDING) You did that? No, sir! Get out. (BEEPING) What's wrong? The magnetic mass has destroyed his circuits. We will start again. I want you to redesign this circuitry and shield it. You are to work day and night. We shall start right now. Where are you going, Madame? Don't you know, Doctor? Don't desert us now. It's only going to take us a short while longer. Do what you want to. Our country is withdrawing all aid, Doctor. You can't do this. I must ask that you reconsider. You force me to delay the new construction, and the source of Element X is mine. Only I can take it. What if another country gets it, not yours? Should I take that as a threat? Your country already has a huge stake in the robot. I don't suggest you quit. All right, I'll request that we grant you the extra time you want. Dr. Who, I should mention this. More of your blundering, and you're through. (THUDDING) Control Guard. (ALARM BLARING) Control! Turn it off! Hey, get him out. Hurry! Come on, give me your hand. Up you go. Come on. Secure the engine. (ALARM BLARING) All stations, report your damage. How does it look down there? Hey, something's wrong with the rudder. Water pipe on the port side broken. What happened? Rockslide down the canyon wall, sir. Commander, we should take a look at the rudder. All right. Surface for repairs. Control! Aye, aye, sir. Surface, 15 degrees. We'll have to check the nuclear reactors. (SIGHS) Sir, we're getting the repairs underway. Thanks. That rockslide was made to order. There's a perfect bay for anchoring on that island. Let's take advantage of it while the ship is being repaired. You're hurt. Why didn't you come for treatment right away? It's nothing. I wish you would do as you're told. First chance I get to do my job as a nurse, and you... Oh, my. What are you laughing at, sir? I can't help it. You've got your wish, and I'll get mine. We'll be landing on Mondo Island. (BIRDS CHIRPING) That's funny. There are no villagers here this time. Was the island inhabited? (MAN SHOUTING IN JAVANESE) (YELLING IN JAVANESE) Do you understand? Yes. It's a Javanese dialect. He's warning us not to enter. He says that it's taboo, and that it must not be broken. Kong? Wong. That means, "King." The natives call him King Kong. He says we're trespassing on Kong's home. Do you mean he actually exists? We'll soon find out. Let's get hold of the old one and see what else we can learn. Susan, you'd better wait here. Alone? You're safer here. Watch yourself. (BIRDS CALLING) (PANTING) This way. (SUSAN SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (GASPS) (SUSAN CONTINUES SCREAMING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (ROARING) (SUSAN SCREAMING) (KONG ROARING) (GROWLING) Over there. (ROARING) (SCREECHING) (ROARING) (SCREECHING) (ROARING) (SUSAN GASPS) No, don't shoot. Wait. SUSAN: Kong! Look. Put me down, Kong. Put me down! Down! Kong, put me down! Please, Kong. Down. (GASPS) Susan! (sesame) (GROWLS) (GROANING) Let's get out of here. Wait. We can't leave him like this. It's our only chance. Now come on. (GROWLING) Hurry. We're lost if he catches us this time. (BELLOWING) (ROARING) Look, starboard. He jammed the controls. (SCREECHES) Look, there's Kong. (GROANING) I think we stabilized it. Hang on. Here we go. NELSON: Take the controls. Stop firing! Stop firing! Hold it, men. This is your commander. We're coming aboard. Give the order to dive. Prepare to dive. Rig to dive. (GROANING) (ROARING) All right, sir? Yes. Stand by for emergency dive. We can't, sir. The rudder's not working yet. Well, then, we'll just have to make... Hey! How are you doing? Are you through? Not yet, sir. How much longer? Should be about 10 minutes more. That long? All right. Hurry. I don't think he means to sink the ship. Is he playing a game with us? No. I don't think he is. What do you intend to do? He wants us to get out there, so I'll go out and quiet him down. Commander, I'll go out. I won't let you. Kong let me go when he had me in the palm of his hand. Commander, let me go, please. He wants me. (BANGING) ls there any other way? (BANGING CONTINUES) All right. See if you can win some time for us. We've got to get out of this inlet. Make preparations to dive. Make emergency repairs. Aye, sir. Susan. You Okay? Take care. Kong, please! Don't shake the ship. I sleep and I eat on this ship. Engine rooms, A-okay. You'd better stand watch outside. When we're ready to dive, call Susan in. (GASPING) Put me down. Please! No. No, Kong. Take me back. Take me back to the ship, Kong. Let's go to the ship. Please. I don't want to go with you. Thank you, Kong. Susan, we're all ready. Goodbye, Kong. You gave us quite a scare out there. (ALL LAUGHING) Your attention, please. We're dropping everything and heading directly for UN headquarters in New York. Our report will create a sensation among the world's scientists. And you'd better get out of those wet clothes. Kong is back on shore. This is Mondo Island, the home of Kong. And in addition to Kong... There are mammoth reptiles living on the island that have long since become extinct on other continents. This island could be called a living museum of the prehistoric age. (ALL EXCLAIMING) This concludes my report. Are there any questions? (PEOPLE CHATTERING) At the meeting of the scientific committee this morning it was decided to send the Explorer out again. Is this for the purpose of capturing Kong? No, not to capture him, but to study him in his natural habitat. It would be, to say the least, difficult to care for him here in New York. Will you be accompanied by the same crew? Yes. Essentially the same crew will go on the expedition. Especially Lt. CDR. Nomura and Miss Watson, sitting here beside me. They are very well-known to Kong. Kong was apparently gentle with It. Watson. May I ask why? Miss Watson, do you know a reason you can tell me? It's very easy for us to understand. You see, as ridiculous as it may sound... Kong is a male and Miss Watson is... Well, see for yourselves, gentlemen. (ALL LAUGHING) If there are no further questions, I will now turn the meeting over to the Chairman of the Council. Thank you very much for your kind attention. (BEEPING) Code signal, LCM3. Go ahead. My country is going to grant you more time. Nelson sold you on the Kong, huh? We can now use his Kong to do the digging for us. The real Kong's a mammal. Could he stand the radiation, Doctor? Kong can resist it better than anything. He cannot stand it forever, though. We will only need the big beast a day or two, you know. I think that, that will have to do. I agree. Now I shall go after him. Can you get Kong to obey you? You should consider that, Doctor. You should know that I do. You should also know, we can't go on without your aid. You can do this without additional aid. You can control Kong as Nelson did. A woman is the secret. Susan Watson got Kong to do anything she asked. Might I ask, what do we do with Watson and Nelson when we're through? (LAUGHING) That is quite easy. Merely a dirty detail. I'll support you 30 days more. How you do it is your concern. I want you to succeed. I should hate to hear that you had died. Must proceed quickly. The Explorer, with Nelson, will be here any day. Your copters should be ready right now. Yes, sir. There he is. (SNARLING) (GROWLS) All right, get ready. MAN: Ready, sir. Away. (GROANING) That's good. Let's land. (GROANING) Excellent Hook up to him. (CLAN KING) (CLICKING) (MAN SHOUTING IN JAVANESE) (SPEAKING JAVANESE) Yes, yes. Kong's mine now. Ready to go, sir. That's good. Prepare to land. (BIRDS CHIRPING) This proves Kong's still on the island. Yeah, I think he's still here. Had a recent donnybrook. He must be near here some place. We don't want to excite him, so just the three of us will go on from here. Aye, sir. Let's go. Kong's opponents were human beings. It smells like ether. Lieutenant... Have the men collect samples of these shell casings. Then let's spread out and search for Kong. We should be able to find him easily enough, if he's lying around some place. Okay, get going- It looks like Kong escaped after putting up a terrific battle. Yes. Still, I don't know. (GASPING) Carl! Carl! Here. He's been shot. Is there any chance? (MUMBLING) What did he say? He said that an Oriental skeleton... A devil with eyes like a gutter rat... Kidnapped Kong and took him away into the skies. Lieutenant, see that he has a decent burial. Yes, sir. Was he the only one here? It looks that way. Wish we could have talked to the old one sooner. He told us enough. I have an idea who the kidnapper is. It must be my old friend, that international Judas, Dr. Who. (MACHINES BEEPING) Send this rush to New York. Aye, aye. "Proceed immediately to Station 6318, north." "Start investigation at the nearest field office." Right here. That's Tokyo. It looks like an Asiatic country is tied in. A check in Tokyo will tell us where this came from. I don't know. Do you really think we can locate Kong? Sure. We'll find him. As long as they haven't taken him to the North Pole. All right. Come down. (YELLS) (METAL CRASHING) (GRUNTS) Knock before you enter next time. All right, state what it is you want. New York, huh? The UN has begun to ask a lot of questions about us. The members of the UN Science Council already know this name. Don't worry about them. You sure you removed all evidence? Yes. Worry not. I can outwit the UN any day and anytime. Did you see our giant ape? My thought is that under ether he won't be much use. You underrate what a genius I am. I can control the ape. Will he do as you order? Hypnotic susceptibility. That's the secret. Hypnosis? A creature with Kong's intelligence is easily handled. That's another little thing I learned through Carl Nelson. (LAUGHING) Recall, Doctor. You agreed that you would get Carl Nelson's crew... So that they could handle Kong, yes? Nelson and his crew will be on their way soon. This is their last trip. They will aid us as needed, then we will just do away with them. (INTERCOM BUZZING) MAN ON RADIO: A Japanese aircraft is calling the commander. I will connect you, sir. Roger. Put him through. Over. JAPANESE PILOT: An emergency has arisen. I have been sent from the UN Field Office to transport you to Tokyo as fast as possible. CDR. Nelson, It. CDR. Nomura, and It. Watson are requested to immediately collect all pertinent evidence and transfer to this aircraft. Over and out. (MOTOR WHIRRING) Right here. What is this emergency situation? The Kong has gone ashore at Hokkaido, sir. Hokkaido? Yes, early today. We're under orders to take you and your crew there right away. I don't trust the pilot. And I don't think they're Japanese. (KONG ROARING) (BEEPING) Release him. Is it all right? He'll do whatever I say. (BEEPING) Kong, you are to obey these orders. Listen. Element X is in the crater. (ROARS) You will go out there and dig it up. That tunnel will take him right into our crater. Let's hope that nothing goes wrong now. (ROCKS CRUMBLING) DR. WHO: Kong, you must dig faster. Kong! Continue. (ROARS) Go ahead. Remember, you're to dig it up. My Kong could never dig like that. Kong, what's the matter? You're slowing down. Wake up! Dig! Kong, you must do as I order. Dig. Continue to dig. Kong! (GRUNTING) Wake up. You shall not sleep. Wake up! Dig! Dig, Kong. Dig- Can't you hear? Go on, you idiot ape. Kong. Kong, wake up. I command you. (ROARING) Dig, you dumb beast. Out. Get away. (BEEPING) Let's go again. Kong, once again. Dig! (ROARING) The beast has escaped. (GRUMBLING) Close the tunnel, quick. Right. Just as I thought. Kong could very easily stand the radiation. Unluckily, we couldn't maintain the power that we had. (BEEPING) Now what? Sir, Nelson's in the laboratory. Oh! Carl Nelson is here now? Aye. They constructed a robot just like ours. Looks like Dr. Who wasn't satisfied with a robot. He wanted the real Kong. Carl, glad you could come. Nomura, you, too. Been a long time. Obviously, not enough years to suit me. What is this all about? Is Kong here? Yes. That's where he is usually kept. What do you think of this Kong? (BEEPING) Do you recognize your brainchild? You'd steal Niagara Falls for a drink of water. But... You want the real Kong to do something the robot can't do. Right? I'm after X, Nelson. Element X? Mmm-hmm. Under the ice here is all I want. Only Kong's muscle can get it all out. You know what we can get from him. You can't use the robot, huh? And Kong won't do what you want him to do. That's why you brought us here. You are so right. You think we'll agree to help you? I predicted you would not. Will you, It. Watson? I won't help you, either. We shall see. Come. Well, this is great. It's a pretty odd lab. So this is Dr. Who's guest room. With no color television. At least we can joke a little. Actually, I'm awfully afraid. We all are, Susan. If Who manages to extract the Element X... There'll be no object in keeping us alive. Nelson, you are to come. Hello there. (DOOR CLOSING) Won't you sit down? Would you like a drink? Yeah. Why not? You know, I'm slightly confused. You take your typical Oriental Mata Hari, now... What are you saying? Let me put it this way. If you'll excuse the corny cliché... What's a nice girl like you doing in a place like this? My answer is a corny cliché. Did you ever hear it? Don't judge a book according to its cover. Or a snake, by its color. That's well-put. What's your connection with Dr. Who? Business. But you should know that I don't really want to go on in it. Tell me one thing first. Do you work for him, or does he work for you? Does life here in the North interest you? My clear, we can easily get all the world capitals. London, Paris... I can arrange it so this lab is yours. Please stay here with me. You can run the whole thing, Carl. If the money holds out. What if there's no country to buy Element X... Once you mine it? You don't have to be worried about that. You're not Japanese. Chinese? Thai? Vietnam? Burma? You're getting warm, Carl. Getting too warm. All right. He's a hard one to handle. Nelson's an unusual man. He is not the kind of man that you are used to. That's why he appeals to me. An idealist. But I know how to make him do anything we want. Susan. Look at it this way, it can only get better. Because it certainly can't get any worse. (LAUGHING) Carl, look. Carl, may I see you outside? What is it this time? Torture? It's been too long since we've had a game of chess together. Your two friends are quite affectionate. They could be happy, if you don't interfere. Susan. Now the cell temperature is zero. (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (PANTING) You know they can't stand the bitter cold. You know what will happen, unless you rescue them. Only a little cooperation will do it. Susan, here. This Will... No, Jiro. It's better this way. (WIND HOWLING) If you'd just cooperate those young people could be enjoying a little hot tea right now, Carl. Kong will listen more to those two than to me. Check. Those walls are being turned into ice. Why won't you save them? Why should you endure this when it is not necessary? Nelson cannot aid you any longer He's been canceled. You dog. I am a realist, and I need you. So I am going to be generous. I will let you go without a bit of trouble and with lots of cash. You just have to do one thing for me. (SCOFFS) You think I wouldn't kill you? I could and I would. (SUSAN SCREAMING) Susan! Susan! (PANTING) Jiro! Jiro! (GRUNTING) Do you think you can change your ideals now? Are you ready with an answer right now? Susan, don't do it. Shut up. Let's see how your hero likes you when you're disfigured a little bit. Let's see what the ice will do to your lovely skin. JIRO: No. Susan! (ROARING) It's Kong. It's Kong. Kong's escaped. Get the keys. Hurry, Susan. (ROARING) Kong's escaped! Look out! (ROARING) (ALARM BLARING) The robot is ready. Go get that ape. (BEEPING) (BEEPING) You're still alive. How did you get out of the chamber? Dr. Who left the keys on the desk... Talk later. We've got to go. This way. (ROARING) (SCREECHING) (HELICOPTER WHIRRING) (MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO) Don't worry, there's no poison in this. It looks like we have all failed. Let's forget Element X and enjoy a drink. Stand up. Can Kong stay in the water a long time? Yes, he can swim a little. More than you can. He travels from Mondo to other islands as he pleases. Don't you realize that you are through, Doctor? We're all through. We are all leaving now in pursuit. Get ready to go. You're a failure. Not a chance of that. You'll see when I get Kong, and this girl will do what I say. Get going. Ready. Lower. MAN: Let it down. The radio just had some interesting news. Kong swam ashore, near Tokyo. Don't go. Don't take that robot into Tokyo. I cannot permit it. Wait. It could be our last chance to get Kong. At sea, our robot Kong cannot get him. On ground, the machine will take the real Kong without any doubt. I'm not concerned about which one wins. There's too great a risk. It just can't be. Why are you so highhanded, Madame? If those two fight in Tokyo, thousands would get killed, and you and I know it. Suddenly, you're such a moralist. Tell us, how come? Element X is a real killer. Not millions, not 10 millions... 100 or so millions would get killed this time. It's just that my country... We can't stand an international incident right now. Dear Madame, let's talk inside. (SIREN BLARING) MAN ON PA SPEAKER: The giant Kong has swum ashore... And he's approaching the center of Tokyo. The Defense Agency urgently requests all citizens to take shelter immediately. Take shelter immediately. (SIRENS BLARING) (MACHINE WHIRRING) (BEEPING) (GRUNTS) Please, we should hurry. Why are you helping us now? My work now isn't so important, but you are. Something happen between you and Dr. Who? I can't tell you. When you get to shore, lead Kong outside Tokyo. Otherwise, thousands will get killed. You're coming with us. Sorry. I can't do it. You can't stay behind, you'll be alone. You don't know what Dr. Who will do. Don't worry about it. The things you're going to need are in the next cabin. We just can't let you stay here. You should know that I represent a certain country. I'll take full responsibility for you. Thank you. I'm so sorry my country wasn't right. Now hurry. (BEEPING) Thanks. Thanks. Good luck. Hey, you! Where are you going? Hey, you! Don't use that gun. You'll get the whole country out here. Don't do it! Don't! (GUN FIRING) (MOTOR WHIRRING) (SIRENS WAILING) (ROARING) (TELEPHONES RINGING) Here's where he came ashore. He first appeared in the bay, here. Stop your attack immediately. If you force Kong to fight, he'll destroy the city. Who are you? I'm... Well, I'm out of uniform... But I'm CDR. Carl Nelson, captain of the UN submarine, Explorer. Yes. Now, we'll do everything we can to try and calm him down. But you must hold off your troops. (HELICOPTERS WHIRRING) (ROARING) (ALL CLAMORING) Let me go. Please, don't. He'll get angry. Then he'll destroy the city. Headquarters. "MAN". Turn off lights. Fall back. Fall back. That's right, sir. Hold it! Hey! It's all right. Kong! The UN? Yeah. Take this. Here. Kong! Kong! Is she insane? She's all right. Kong is always gentle with her. Calm down, Kong. SUSAN: We're your friends. (ALARM WAILING) Hey! Look at that! Oh, no. Come on, take shelter. Hurry! Where can we go? Look at that. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (ROARING) SUSAN: No, Kong, run away. You mustn't fight him. It's not alive, it's a machine. You can't defeat him, Kong. (ROARING) (GROANING) (BEEPING) (HELICOPTERS WHIRRING) Kong! Run away! Run away! The real Kong seems quicker. My Kong won't tire. Behind you. Get the girl. (SUSAN GASPING) Kong! Kong! (ALL SCREAMING) (SIREN BLARING) DR. WHO: Kong, listen! You will return quietly to the ship. If you don't, I'll drop the girl. Help me. Kong! (GROWLING) We will get him now. Prepare to dock the ship. You each know your job. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. DR. WHO: Well? My plans were really correct. We're a success. A gun, Madame? You're going to die. Step back there and turn around. What did you do? Nothing. (GRUNTS) (ROARING) (GROANING) (SUSAN SCREAMING) (ROARING) I'm Nomura with the UN. Yes, sir. I need a ranger unit, order it. Right. (KONG ROARING) (KONG ROARING) On the double! Susan, wait. Wait there. Jiro. Hold on. Go on. Easy. Go get them a rope. Susan, don't worry. We're just about there. Kong. (KONG ROARING) (GASPING) Susan! Jiro! (SUSAN SCREAMING) There they are. (ROARING) Susan. Quick, the other control. (GRUNTS) Stop it, let her go. (GROANS) (GUN FIRING) Hey, get out of here. Let's go! Go! (SIREN BLARING) (ALL CLAMORING) Susan! (SOBBING) Commander! Thank God, you're alive. It's all right. It's all right. It's all over now. (ROARING) Weigh anchor right away. What's wrong here? Shouldn't we wait till Kong is brought here? Moron! The real Kong is lost to us. Kong's coming! He's here, on the docks. Kong's on the docks? Yes. (EXCLAIMING) We have to go. You said we were here... To get Kong and the girl. No, get us out of here now. Now! Do as I say. (ROARING) (SIREN WAILING) (BRAKES SCREECHING) Kong, stop that ship. Get the ship, Kong. (ROARING) Sir, hello. Will he catch it? Yeah. I think he will. On deck. Let's go. There he is. Let's get him. Keep firing. Let's go. (GROANING) (ROARING) Kong! Kong! King Kong! Don't call. Yeah, let him go. But he's going... He's going home. I think he's had enough of what we call civilization.
