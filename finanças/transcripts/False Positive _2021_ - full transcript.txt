Well... womp-womp. Hey, come on. Stop it. I can't. I-I can't. I just wanted it to be natural. It will be natural. Just let me call him. Look, he's one of the top five fertility specialists in the world. As a woman, this is the one thing I'm supposed to be able to do, and I can't do it. Well, let's just find out if we can get pregnant. And if we can't, then, you know, we'll blow the college fund on some of the best vacations of our lives. Call him. Really? Oh. Oh. You're gonna love him. Wow. - Hello. - Hi. - Hi. - You must be Lucia and Adrian. - Yes. - Um, I go by Lucy, but... Can we get a name change from "Lucia" to "Lucy," please? Oh. I'm Dr. Hindle's head nurse, Dawn. Let me just get you started with some paperless paperwork. And Rita... can help out with refreshments. Do you want a, uh, espresso or something? Sure. Enjoy it while you can. Go ahead. Take a seat. I'm changing the file name now. Thank you. Here. Rita recommended that for you. Mmm. Gonna be good. Adrian. Hey. So nice to see you. Yeah, it's been a long time, hasn't it? Yes, it has indeed. Hello, Lucy. - Hi. - Lovely to meet you. Such a pleasure to meet you. So... you two need a little help. - Uh, y-yeah. - Yeah. We've been trying pretty hard for two years. Yes. I know. Adrian told me. I don't get it. I... thought I have been doing everything right. I eat well. I exercise. I haven't even had a drink for two years. I don't want you to have to question everything you're doing. I will give you the best possible chance of getting pregnant. How does that sound? That sounds great. Good. Oh, thank you, Dawn. Hm. Did you know that Adrian was the most talented surgeon I ever taught? Oh, God. Stop it. There was this one woman, she had breast cancer, and the hospital wouldn't pay for a post-mastectomy augmentation. So your husband, he just goes and does it without telling anyone. Well, I-I told her. Yes, and the board wanted me to let you go. I told them, "If he goes, I go." I was sick of teaching at the hospital anyway, so I quit. We should've started our own practice right then and there. Yeah. Would've been great. Lot of work, though. Mm, I know it's hard. Sometimes I wish I could clone myself. It's the only way I'd get the job done. Okay. - Your architecture is great. - Oh. Problem is low hCG levels. We'll give you a little boost post- and pre-insemination, monitor your numbers from there. That's it? Yes. Really? I've just been tested so many times. All these women... All these women here had troubles. Some... Some worse than you. All happy mums I've sent home with babies. We have IUI and IVF. IVF makes babies in a test tube. IUI makes them inside of you. I've invented a method that's a little of both. I like to call it, um, in utero Hindle fertilization. You can help me with that one, as you're the marketing genius. Okay. Oh. Well, then, thank you, John. - It's a pleasure. - Yeah. Thank you so much, Dr. Hindle. Thank you. Luce? Got five? Dirk's considering making you lead on the Wyth account. Oh, my God! - Are you serious? - Yes! Mihail's managing four clients. I've got six, and I was like, "What about Lucy?" Greg, you said that? Thank you so much. Of course. He wants to see Bryon's ideas before pulling the trigger. Of course. But you're what this pitch needs. Some female intuition. Although I like to think I cover a little of that myself. Now, if this works out, it's gonna come with more responsibility. Travel, more money. Luce, I'm fighting for you. Also... I'm thinking Dig In for lunch. What do you think? I'm obsessed with Dig In. - I'll start an order. - Great. I'm gonna do the, uh, grilled tofu market bowl and a side of wilted beet greens. - Yum. I'm gonna do the same. - Mm. Is there anything else I can do for you? No. Uh... thank you. Okay. Lucy, would you like to watch? - Oh. No. - Here you go. Perfect. Okay. Okay. - Mm. - Rita. Good work, son. This is powerful stuff. Mm. Oh. Brilliant. Hmm. She looks like a smart shopper. Why are you fighting me on this? Okay, Luce, what do you think of her? She's kind of too runway. I think of Wyth as more "girl on the subway" hot. Thank you. That's what I said. We need subway hot, not runway. Subway hot? Okay. What about this one? Um... I'll be back in a second. You are... 100% pregnant. Oh, my God! Oh, thank you, Doctor. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Thank you. Thank you, Dr. Hindle. Come on. Stop it. I'm almost done. Alright. You go. - After all that? - Yes. Okay. Fine. If we have a girl... Mm-hmm. ...Wendy. Oh, Luce. That's perfect. We can make Wendy a little Peter Pan costume, in honor of your mom. - That would be nice. - Mm. Okay. I'm only gonna do boys' names from now on. Okay. What about... Adrian? As in Junior? Kind of cool, right? Hey. Um, I will take orders in just a couple minutes, um, but I wanted to talk to you about something. Sure. Are you, uh, feeling nervous about the pitch? Actually, I wanted to let you know that I... am pregnant. I knew it! I seriously have some sort of women's-intuition thing going on. You have been glowing! Oh. Thank you. Alright. What's up? - Oh. - Tell him. Go on, tell him. Okay. I'm pregnant. - Yes! - Aww! No wonder you've been glowing. That's what I just said! I literally said that to my wife last night. I was like, "Lucy is glowing." You guys, thank you. That's so sweet. Hey, let's get a really good lunch today. Whatever you want. Even better than Dig In. What about Wyth? You know, it might not be a bad idea to let them know you're expecting. Make them feel bad if they don't hire us. Yeah, and, I mean, if you're not showing by then, we'll just plump you up with a pillow. Yeah. Wyth has really nice pillows. That's right. Mm-hmm. Thank you, Dawn. Oh. Wonderful, wonderful. Hm. Right. Here we go. Oh, my God. Is that a... Yep. And there's the second. Twin set. Males. We have twin boys! Twins. And... the third. Female singlet. Wow. Just relax. Just relax. Water, please. Relax. This is absolutely normal for how aggressive we boosted your numbers. I was not gonna send you home empty-handed. So, we've got twin boys and a female singlet, total of three. Now... selective reduction. Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but with your history and these elevated numbers, we're looking at an increase of possible complications. Preemies or, worse, miscarriage. By reduction, uh, you mean... an abortion? We'd be making a sacrifice to ensure a successful birth. Either the boys, because they share the same sac, or the girl. Now, I would strongly recommend we keep the boys. They look healthy. And the girl? Well, she's a bit small. Um... C... Uh... Could we... Like, is there... - It's okay. - Sorry. I-I just don't want to make the wrong choice. Lucy, Lucy, Lucy. I will not let that happen. Yeah. The odds of you having a baby have just increased 100%. But yes. You do have a decision to make. Thank you. Adrian, can I have a word? Okay. I know, sweetie. It's a lot to think about. Yeah. Thanks. I heard we have a celebration this evening. We did it. I'm pregnant. Yes, we're pregnant. Come on. It's expensive. Do you want to talk about it? I'm still processing the whole thing. Aren't you? Yeah. But I agree with Dr. Hindle. I think we should have the boys. You do? You said you've always wanted a sibling. You know, a lot of your quirks are from being an only child. Uh... Two at once is a lot. Look. What do you think the chances are of us being able to get pregnant again? Slim. I-I'm saying that for myself, 'cause I'm getting up there, too. What about Wyth? I'll just take on more clients if you want to quit work. I don't want to stop working. I'm just starting to get ahead. Babe, we've always talked about having more than one. Yeah, that was before we couldn't have any. Yeah, which is why I'm saying that we should have... You asked me my opinion, so I gave it to you. I want the girl. I've always seen her, pictured us lying together in bed, staring at each other. And she would see through me with these clear eyes, right past me to some better version of myself. Come here. I hear everything that you're saying. I just don't want you to regret your decision. Are you serious? Would you like to hear this evening's specials? Uh, yes. That would be great. Tonight we have a pan-roasted duck. It is in a persimmon glaze served with a side of roasted local root vegetables. We also have a homemade tagliatelle pasta with black-pepper cream sauce with foraged mushrooms on top. I'm sorry if I made you feel bad. It's okay. Let's have Wendy. It's what you want. Are you sure? I mean, if you are. Oh. Thank you. I love you. I love you, too. What? John wants me to present him with some big award. Probably just wants to embarrass me with a story or whatever, but... Well, you have to do it. That's some real exposure. Yeah, then I have to write a speech, then I have to... I'll write it for you. Duh. Are you serious? Of course. He got us pregnant. You owe him. - Yeah. LUCY: Well, can't argue with that. Lucy, you're not gonna be doing this on your own. You should join a mommy group or something. - That's a great idea. - Yeah. I wish one of my friends was pregnant. You know, Eden doesn't even have that boyfriend anymore, and Alyson is like... Alyson's Alyson. Come on. You know you love them. They're just... Loud? I was gonna say young, but they are also loud. Mm. So then I got into part-time food styling. I was just like, "Fuck it." - That's awesome. - Good for you. - Yeah. - That's great. Um, well, I'm Corgan. Uh, I'm a paralegal, and I'm 17 weeks pregnant with Rafe, like "Ralph" but French. Oh. Cute. My husband, Brad, is a lawyer at Goldman, in house. Um, and we're just so excited. We did a bunch of rounds of IVF, and, you know, third time's the charm. - Oh. - Oh. We tried two times, and this one finally stuck. Good, good. I kind of went a little off the deep end. Mommy brain is a real thing. Oh, girl. We did IVF, too. Oh. Who'd you go to? The Hindle Women's Center. Oh, my God. I was on a wait list there for a year and a half before we gave up. Oh. Wow. Can I ask how long you had to wait? Um, I actually didn't because my husband, uh, was his student in medical school. - Oh, my God. How lucky. - Wow. Well, what kind of doctor is he? Adrian is a reconstructive surgeon at Sloan Kettering. Uh, does he do mommy makeovers? Yeah. Can you get, like, a Hindle C-section and a tummy tuck all in one shot? I never thought about that, but I'm gonna ask him. I would really like to get in on that plan, right? - Uh, yeah. - Can we get a family discount? Yeah. But you're so tiny, you probably won't even need it. - Oh. - You are gonna be huge! Thank you. Lucy. Are you ready? Yeah. There's no need to be worried, Lucy. I've done this procedure thousands of times over the past 30 years. Dr. Hindle is an innovator in the field. You are with truly the best in the biz. I swear I didn't tell her to say that. You are in good... and hopefully warm hands. Okay. You're gonna feel a little pinch. Just breathe deeply. Very good. Breathe. Deeply. In through your nose. And out through your mouth. Breathe. I've perfected the technique. Do you think she can hear us? No, no, no, no. She's out cold. She'll get her fairy-tale ending. Wendy. Wendy, it's time to go, sweetheart. Hey. You zonked out on us. How are you feeling? Okay, I guess. Well, you can just rest up now. Lucy, I want you to think of this as a fresh start. Okay? - Okay. - Good. Oh, Dawn. Okay, sweetie. You might not want to tell anyone about this. You know, there's so much judgment and misinformation out there. Yes. You feel free to call us any time. Visit any time you wish. What happens to... the twins? What do you mean? The, um... reductions. Reduced fetuses attach to the placenta and get extracted with the afterbirth. So they won't affect Wendy? No. No, no, no. She's all taken care of. Thank you so much, Doctor. Oh. Let's have a hug, shall we? There we go. Mm! You rest now. Adrian? - Thanks, man. - Yes. Good man. Good man. And when is she gonna start calling me John? - Well, that's up to... - Oh. - Thank you, John. - Bye, now. Try to enjoy some quality mom time. You deserve it. Remember, you're pregnant. You know, I... thought I heard these weird things during the reduction, you and Hindle talking about... I don't know. Really? Must've been dreaming. Right up here, Mohammad. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. The Internet is full of misinformation. I don't want you getting paranoid. What you have is called OHSS... ovarian hyperstimulation. Actually, it's a good thing. Your uterus is making room, so it stretches, sometimes a little too thin, and it bleeds. So you're not concerned? No. Now, there'll be no more googling. Understood? The choices Wyth have made are subtle but powerful, elevating yourselves in a marketplace full of basics. We here at Liegler want to re-fashion your consumers, your "fans," as co-creators. You fucking killed it! I did, didn't I? I've known Coraline for decades, started a crew together, and she's a, um... How do I say it? Let's say, uh, tepid. Exactly. For her to say, "I like it"? - Wow! - No, no, no, no. She said, "I like it very much," and that it was very smart. That's a big compliment coming from a... let's say genius. I didn't even hear you come in. Okay. Guess what. What? I nailed the pitch, and I get to lead the Wyth account. That's amazing. Am I gonna be one of those women who has it all? My career, my kids, my old man by my side? Who you calling old? Whoo! Oh, my God. That's so scary. Apparently, umbilical cords are supposed to have two arteries, and mine only has one, because of course it does. I'm so sorry. Half the babies born with this have all sorts of awful complications. I mean, horrible things like deformities. - Oh, God. - I just can't... I just... Dr. Davis says I essentially have to be on bed rest from here on out, which... I guess is okay, 'cause I can quit now and not have to waddle into work for the next five months. You're... You're gonna quit? Oh, Brad and I decided. I mean, if something happened to baby Rafe and I hadn't done everything that I could, I wouldn't be able to live with myself. Maybe you could do a little work from home. Oh, please. I'm so ready to check out. At least you won't have to figure out where to pump. Right? Like, "Oh, excuse me, guys. I'm just gonna go pump in the broom closet real quick. Pump on the toilet." I'm actually gonna pump on the subway 'cause it's less awkward than at work. Oh, thank you for making me laugh. Do you have your notes? Yes. Thank you, by the way. Use them. Don't read them. Yes. I know, I know. Just get that centered. Did you hear that? Yeah. I'm gonna take a look. Nothing. Oh. What can you say about a man who has fundamentally changed fertility? The truth is, you can't really say enough. Not in words. But you can see it. You can see it in the eyes of a mother looking at her newborn for the first time, seeing her purpose, her destiny. You can see it in the giddiness and that nervous energy of new parents bringing their baby home, full of wonder and awe. I'm filled with an enormous warmth tonight, being with John's peers, of course, and honoring him for the fifth time in a row. Dr. John Hindle. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen and honored guests. Basic science. The fundamental foundation of our economic, social, and environmental progress is under attack. Hi, Mama. Hey, Daddy. I got you something. Adrian. We are nowhere near being able to celebrate yet. I don't want to jinx it, mister. I'm celebrating... because we've been through so much already. It's different this time. Adrian. You deserve it. These are difficult times, challenging times. But there is no greater reward than to see a young mother who has toiled with a burning desire to give life and who now lies before me with her infant on her breast, spent with exhaustion and euphoria of birth, to look into that child's eyes and to know that I've been part of their existence in this life. That is the true gift of my work. I'd like to put it on you. Okay. It is... very beautiful. Honestly, thank you so much. We are building a generation, progressing families, and giving mothers their fairy-tale ending. It's why I'm here. Tonight... and always. On behalf of all the families whose lives I am now forever part of... I humbly accept this award. Does your doctor claim to know more about your body than you do? That your body is high-risk? Hey! Whoa. Hey. Relax. - What are you doing? - I th... I thought I-I heard someone. Oh. It's alright. Come here. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. We managed to get a second opinion, and we're feeling so much better about Rafe and everything. - Are you serious? - Yeah. - That's such a relief. - It is. Oh, I'm so happy to hear that. How are you? I'm good. I'm okay. Are you? I-I just... I'm starting to feel nervous. Oh. A little... crazy. I-I'm seeing things. Honey, me too. I'm having the wildest mommy brain lately. I don't... I don't think it's mommy brain. Something's... not right with Wendy. What do you mean? Did Dr. Hindle say something? No. I-I-I think Dr. Hindle... did something to Wendy. Lucy. No. I mean, that's... You're just... This is a lot. Have you talked to Adrian about how you're feeling? - I really think... - No. I think Adrian's in on it. In on what? That's why I'm... I'm thinking of using this midwife instead. Lucy. This is not like Rafe. Unless something is really wrong, you should not be making sweeping changes to your birth plan. Yeah. Hey. This pregnancy shit is no joke. - Right? - Yeah. Okay, it's really scary. But you are not alone. Thank you, Corgan. I'm gonna hop on the bike. If you want to pass out before I come back in, I'll be quiet when I come back in. - Okay. - Alright. Unless you want me to stay. No, no. Enjoy. Alright. Does your doctor claim to know more about your body than you do? That your body is high-risk? Do you feel disenfranchised by what swirls around us regarding motherhood, trying to get pregnant, work, your birth plan? Feeling connected to your changing body, longing for a deeper experience? Hi. I'm Grace Singleton. And I believe that women are gifted with the highest-potential purpose for humankind. I became a midwife because I wanted women to connect with this planet's most powerful and phenomenal instrument... their bodies. We have a spiritual current that flows through us. We are vessels for a cosmic feat. That privilege makes women the strongest people on the earth. Modern gynecology stands on the shoulders of men who thought the womb was an unruly creature inside a woman's body. Doctors said labor was traumatic and that we needed to be subdued. Suddenly, we can't handle the pain as our ancestors did, billions of women before us, as if birth was broken before these men came up with the solutions. They fear, loathe, and covet that power, and always under the guise of concern. We've been robbed of experiencing the richness of this process in all its messy, complex, awesome entirety. Letting them make the decisions for us... That's what I call high-risk. Lucy, how do you feel right now? I feel like my head is spinning. Confront whatever it is that's blocking you from you. Let it out. From your gut. Go. Go, Lucy. Let it out. Remember how you're feeling right now. Empowered. Free. Lucy. You alright? Yeah. I thought I heard you scream. I-I... I must've been dreaming. Okay. Um... Well... time to turn off your iPad. Go to bed, you millennial. Well, most pregnant people have had medicalized entry into care, especially if you've had IVF or IUI. Pregnant people are not ill. They're pregnant. How is that even within the realm of possibility? Thank you. Well, we sent the portfolio two... over two months ago. Yes. Lucy. Dawn. What are you doing here? I came to get the magazine. With Dr. Hindle on the cover. Oh. Well, he's been working for... oh, for 30 years to get on that cover, and he doesn't appreciate you taking it. I was only borrowing it. I'll bring it back. Oh. Mommy brain. Totally fine. Really? You don't need to s-see her or... Nope. Responding normally. Reflexes, heartbeat. You'd be surprised at how resilient they are. It was very good that you came in, Lucy. There you go. I'm really sorry about the magazine. Mm. Well, I'm sorry about Dawn. She's very loyal and proud of my work. Dawn has worked for me for the past 18 years and fiercely defends her family. Mm. I'm so embarrassed. I really only meant to borrow it. Oh, I know that. Yes, there's a lot of voodoo out there. We just want to make sure that you get the best possible care. Thank you, John, for seeing us so last-minute. Oh. Thank you, buddy. Yes. Okay. Have a good night, hon. So? So... after talking to Mihail and Dirk... we worry about losing momentum. We think Bryon should lead on the Wyth account. Really? You're gonna need time. It's a marathon. Luce, you don't want this to be your first one out of the gate. Are you using m-my deck, my ideas? They loved you at Wyth. We love you at Liegler, Lucy. Come on. Don't take this the wrong way. We just want to make sure things go smoothly. I think I'm gonna need at least a three-month buffer. Yeah. Well, she's gonna need me. Huge change, yeah. J... Hey, you know what? Uh, c... can I call... can I call you right back? Thanks. Bye. You okay? No. Well, what's going on? They're using my deck and my ideas. I got the Wyth account, and now I'm not allowed to work on it. It's okay, it's okay. I just had to get out of there and come see you. I got you something. - Lucy... - It's really, really good. We got it at work the other day. I can't believe we haven't had it yet. What the hell's going on? What? I can't bring my husband lunch? You just brought me lunch. Mommy brain is a real thing, Lucy. Prepartum depression hits about one out of five women. Listen to Dr. Hindle. You should be enjoying this process. We now know that Xanax is safe at .25 milligrams starting the third trimester. This won't affect Wendy? Wendy? Mm, no. No, no. Try and take care of yourself, Lucy, hmm? Can you do that for me? Smile, Lucy. It actually makes you happier. It's scientifically proven. There you go now. Lucia Martin? Yes. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe I'm actually meeting you. I'm a really big fan of your words and your videos. Your whole thing inspires me. It is highly unusual for me to take on a client this late in the process. But you seem vulnerable. This time should feel special and exciting, not a constant uphill battle. You have a lot to unpack. My mom died a few years ago. And I've been hoping that, with Wendy, I might get a piece of her back. But maybe it's wrong to put that kind of pressure on her. See yourself with Wendy, loving her, nurturing her. Laughing with her. Giving her all the strength you have been given, have earned. And look at her. Strong little lady. Hey. How you doing? You're all set. Room 1992. Thank you very much. - Hi. - John. Ohh. Room 1992. I found this in Adrian's safe. What is this? Read this. Do you see that? I-I-I'm part of a study? What study? I-I didn't sign up. Do you see that? An injection. Of what? Look at... Look at this. Look at these photos of me. I-I know they did something to Wendy. I've known it the whole time. This is crazy. I am not crazy. They're trying to make me think I'm crazy. Can I take this and show this to Brad? Why? To get a lawyer's perspective. I mean, he's gonna need to see this for himself. He'll know your rights. Right. Okay. Thank you. Just until we know what this is, you have to act like everything is normal. Hey! Hey, look at me. You okay? What did you do? I think I s... I swallowed water. There's no shame in it. Morning. What's happening? I'm gonna quit. Eating? My job. Everything. Even Dr. Hindle. You're joking. No. I-I want to see Grace Singleton. Sorry. Who? She's this midwife I found, and I saw her yesterday, and, Adrian, she was magical. She was just... amazing. She's just more natural. Hindle and them, they feel so... Ugh, like... Yeah. Look, Luce, we've been seeing him for months. I've known John for years. He... He's the one that got us pregnant. He got me pregnant, Adrian. I don't know. I'm just more comfortable with Grace. Dr. Hindle gives me a bad feeling. So you're basing this all on a fucking feeling? And what am I supposed to tell John? I don't know. He's your friend. No. No. No, no, no. I-I-I have to draw the line somewhere. Well, not around my birth story. Your birth story? So, what, you saw a post, and now you're... you're basing our entire baby's life on a fucking Instagram trend? Let's not forget, this is my baby we're talking about, too. Um, I invited Eden and Alyson to the shower. It's gonna be really fun. - Mmm. - Oh. - This is delicious. - So that's it? Yeah. Do you want some? Did you send the sonogram over to Grace? Yeah, I told you. John is really mad and disappointed. Oh, my gosh. - Oh! Oh, my gosh. - Take it. That is gorgeous. To Lucia from me. Oh, thank you. What is this? It's a first-edition copy of Peter Pan. It's the same one that your mom read to you. I just wanted to do a little something besides the shower. Thank you. Luce? Earth to Lucy! How did you know my name's Lucia? What? I'm sorry. Is it baby brain or is it mommy brain, right? Lucy, are you okay? Hey. Is... Is everything alright? You go to John. What? You go to John. I've had three miscarriages and tried IVF three times, Lucy. I didn't have a choice. When did you go? We were really worried about you, and... and when I told Adrian about my complications, he got me in. After everything I told you, you went to Adrian? You were scaring me. You were obsessing, and... and you seemed really not well. I just thought that your husband should know. Wait. You gave him the file. That was my proof, Corgan. Lucy... Adrian said there is no safe in his office. Oh, my God. Push! Push! Push! Push! Here she comes! Here she comes, here she comes, here she comes. It's a boy. It's a boy. Oh. Oh. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're crowning again. Okay. Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm having the twins! You need to go to the ER right now. She's experiencing a full placental abruption. You need to go. Now! - You're doing great, baby. - Doing great, Lucy. Just push now. Push. - Push, Lucy, push. - You're doing great. It's amazing. You're doing just amazing. It's coming. It's coming. The baby's head is crowning right now. Push. And here he is. Our second baby boy. This is hard, and it's difficult to understand, but we will work through this together. But these are ours, and it is a critical time to create a bond. You know, we have been through... a lot. And... this is not, um... You've been through a lot, Luce... these last couple days, and... It's overwhelming. It's overwhelming. I know it seems hard right now. But this is a good thing. Wait till you see how special these boys are. Such beautiful blue eyes. I can't believe this happened to me. I know, I know. It's crazy. What happened to your office? Wasn't it more culturally, uh... Weren't there, like... masks and... Even your outfit looks... different. No. Nothing has changed. Really? Mm. I am not your mystical Negress, Lucy. I'm sorry. Fuck. I don't even know what to do with myself. Be better. How? I don't have the answers. It's not my job. It's yours. I need to talk to John. Do you have an appointment? I need to talk to John about reducing the wrong... This way. You have two babies and a wonderful husband. If I were you, I would go home and spend every minute with them... mothering them. Just let Adrian and Hindle do the good work they're trying to do. What? Oh. He didn't tell you? Oh. I thought you two were closer than that. Uh, Rita, can you bring in the Martin-Hindle paperwork, please? Oh. Hm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. Adrian's joining the practice. Just think of all the good work they're going to do. Welcome to the family. You poor thing. What Grace did, morally reprehensible. And for her not to have an affiliation with a hospital should be illegal. I just want Wendy. Okay? This world just breaks my heart at times. I don't know what's going on with people these days. We've got pedophiles running the government, terrorism in our schools. Sometimes I feel like there's no hope, no containing the onslaught. Most people don't understand what's best for them. They search for solutions, but God, money, magic... none of these things can fix our problems. None of them cure disease. Science does. We have a saying around here. "God doesn't make babies. I do." Oh, my God. When you and Adrian came in here, you said you wanted a baby. I gave you the best genes there are. My own. You raped me. Oh, please. Lucy. There's no need for hysterics.
