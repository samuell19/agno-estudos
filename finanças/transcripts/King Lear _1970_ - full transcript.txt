BUDRAITIS I thought the king had more affected the Duke of Albany than Cornwall. It did always seem so to us. But now, in the division of the kingdom, it appears not which of the dukes he values most. For equalities are so weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice of either's moiety. Is not this your son, my lord? I have so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am brazed to it. I cannot conceive you. This young fellow's mother could: She had a son for her cradle before she had a husband for her bed. Do you smell a fault? I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it being so proper. But I have a son, sir, by order of law, some year elder than this. Attend the Lords of France and Burgundy, Gloster. I shall, my liege. Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. Know all. Know all: We have divided in three our kingdom. Tis our intent to shake all cares from our age, conferring them on younger strengths, while we unburdened crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, and you, our son of Albany, we have this hour a constant will to publish our daughters' several dowers, that future strife may be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, great rivals in our youngest daughter's love, long here are to be answered. Tell me, my daughters... which of you doth love us most? That we our largest bounty may extend where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril, our eldest born, speak first. I love you more than words can wield the matter. Dearer than eyesight, space and liberty, beyond what can be valued, rich or rare. No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour. As much as child e'er loved, or father found. A love that makes my speech unable, beyond all manner so much I love you. What shall Cordelia do? Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, we make thee lady: To thine and Albany's issue be this perpetual. What says our second daughter, our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak. I am made of that self metal as my sister, and prize me at her worth. In my true heart I find she names my very deed of love, only she comes too short. And find am alone felicitate in your dear highness' love. In your dear highness' love. To thee and thine hereditary ever remain this ample third of our fair kingdom. Then poor Cordelia! And yet not so, since my love's more richer than my tongue. Now, ourjoy, what can you say to draw a third more opulent than your sisters'? Nothing, my lord. Nothing? Nothing. Nothing will come of nothing. Speak again. Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave my heart into my mouth. I love your majesty according to my bond, nor more nor less. Cordelia, mend your speech a little, lest it may mar your fortunes. Good my lord, you have begot me, bred me, loved me. I return those duties back as are right fit: Obey you, love you, and most honour you. Why have my sisters husbands, if they say they love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, that lord shall carry half my love with him, half my care and duty. Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters, to love my father all. But goes thy heart with this? Ay, good my lord. So young, and so untender? So young, my lord, and true. Let it be so, - thy truth, then, be your dower! For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, here I disclaim all my paternal care, propinquity and property of blood, and as a stranger to my heart and me hold thee, from this, for ever! Peace, Kent! I loved her most, and thought to set my rest on her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight! Call France! Call Burgundy! Cornwall and Albany, with my two daughters' dowers digest this third. Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her. Ourself, by monthly course, with reservation of an hundred knights, shall our abode make with you by due turns. We still retain the name, and all the additions to a king, the sway, revenue, execution of the rest be yours. Royal Lear, whom I have ever honoured as my king, as my great patron thought on in my prayers... The bow is bent and drawn! Make from the shaft! Let it fall rather, though the fork invade the region of my heart. Be Kent unmannerly, when Lear is mad. What wouldst thou want? That duty shall have dread to speak, when power to flattery bows? Answer my life my judgement, thy youngest daughter does not love thee least. Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound reverbs no hollowness. Kent, on thy life, no more. My life I never held but as a pawn to wage against thy enemies. No fear to lose it, thy safety being the motive. - Out of my sight! - See better, Lear. Now, by Apollo! Now, by Apollo, king, thou swear'st thy gods in vain. O, vassal! Miscreant! Dear sir, forbear. Hear me, recreant! On thine allegiance, hear me! If tomorrow thy banished trunk be found in our dominions, the moment is thy death! Fare thee well, king! Sith thus thou wilt appear, freedom leaves hence, and banishment is here. Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord. My Lord of Burgundy, we first address towards you, who with this king have rivalled for our daughter. When she was dear to us, we did hold her so, but now her price is fallen. Will you, with those infirmities she owes, dowered with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath, take her or leave her? I tell you all her wealth. Pardon me, royal sir. For you, great king, I would not from your love make such a stray, to match you where I hate. Must be a faith that reason without miracle should never plant in me. I yet beseech your majesty, if for I want that glib and oily art, to speak and purpose not, that you make known it is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness that hath deprived me of your grace and favour, but even for want of that for which I an richer, - a still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue as I am glad I have not. Thou hast her, France: Let her be thine! For we have no such daughter! Time shall unfold what pleated cunning hides: Who covers faults, at last shame them derides. An hundred knights to add to retinue! A hundred knights to add to retinue! Saddle the horses! Call the train together! Saddle the horses! Call the train together! The barbarian that makes his genera- tion messes to gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom be as well relieved, as thou my sometime daughter. Thou, nature, art my goddess! To thy law my services are bound. Wherefore should I permit deprive me, if I'm 12 moonshines lag of a brother? Why bastard? Wherefore base? Why brand they us with base? Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take more composition and quality than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed, go to th'creating a whole tribe of fobs? Well, my legitimate! Kent banished thus! And the king gone tonight! Subscribed his power! All this done upon the gad! Edmund, how now! What news? So please your lordship, none. Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter? I know no news, my lord. What paper were you reading? Nothing, my lord. Why, then, that terrible dispatch of it into your pocket? Let's see. Sir, pardon me. It is a letter from my brother. I find it not fit for your o'er-Iooking. Give me the letter. I shall offend, either to detain or give it. I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote this but as a taste of my virtue. bitter to the best of our times, keeps our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish them. I find an idle bondage in the oppression of aged tyranny, who sways, not as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to me, that of this I may speak more. If our father would sleep till I waked him, you should enjoy half his revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your brother, Edgar>>. Hum... Conspiracy! O villain! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested, brutish villain! Where is he? Suspend your indignation till you can derive from him better testimony of his intent. Edmund, seek him out, wind me into him. These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend no good to us: Brothers divide, in cities, mutinies, in countries, discord, in palaces, treason. And the bond cracked twixt son and father. We have seen the best of our time. - When saw you my father last? - The night gone by. - Spake you with him? - Ay, two hours together. Parted you in good terms? Found you no displeasure in him? None at all. Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended him. And at my entreaty forbear his presence till some little time hath qualified the heat of his displeasure. Some villain hath done me wrong. Have a continent forbearance till the speed of his rage goes slower. Retire with me to my lodging. There's my key. If you do stir abroad, go armed. Armed, brother! He hath no good meaning toward you. What I have told you is nothing like the image and horror of it. By the surfeit of our own behaviour, we make guilty of our disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars. As if we were fools by heavenly compulsion, by an enforced obedience of planetary influence. And admirable evasion of whore-master man, to lay his goatish disposition to the charge of a star! Fut, I should have been what I am, had the maidenliest star in the firmament twinkled on my bastardizing. Let me not stay a jot for dinner! Go get it ready! Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my fool? Go you, and call my fool hither. You, you sirrah, where's my daughter? So please you... What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back! Where's my fool? I think the world's asleep. Where's that mongrel? He says, your daughter is not well. Why came not the slave back to me? He answered me, he would not. He would not! My lord, to my judgement, your highness is not entertained with that ceremonious affection as you were wont. But where's my fool? I have not seen him this two days. Since my young lady's going into France, the fool hath much pined away. No more of that. Go you, and tell my daughter I would speak with her. Go you, call hither my fool! O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir. Who am I, sir? My lady's father. My lord's knave! - I'll not be struck, my lord! - Nor tript neither, football player. I thank thee, fellow. What art thou? A man, sir. A very honest- hearted fellow, and as poor as the king. If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou? To serve you. If I like thee no worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet. There's earnest of thy service. Let me hire him too. How now, my pretty knave! How dost thou? - You were best take my coxcomb. - Why, fool? For taking one's part that's out of favour. This fellow hath banisht two one's daughters, and did the third a blessing against his will. If thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb. Take heed, sirrah, the whip. Truth's a dog must to kennel, he must be whipped out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink. A bitter fool! Dost thou know the difference between a bitter fool and a sweet fool? No, lad. Teach me. That lord that counselled thee To give away thy land, Come place him here by me, Do thou for him stand. The sweet and bitter fool Will presently appear, The one in motley here, The other found out there. Dost thou call me fool? All thy other titles thou hast given away, that thou wast born with. This is not altogether fool. Fools had never less grace in a year, For wise men are grown foppish, And know not how their wits to wear, Their manners are so apish. When were you wont to be so full of songs? Ever since thou madest thy daughters thy mothers: For when thou gavest them the rod, and putt'st down thine own breeches. Then they for sudden joy did weep, And I for sorrow sung, That such a king should play bo-peep, And go the fools among. Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach thy fool to lie. An you lie, we'll have you whipped. Thy daughters will have me whipped for speaking true, thou'It for lying, and sometimes I'm whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any kind o'thing than a fool. And yet I would not be thee, nuncle. Thou hast pared thy wit o'both sides, and left nothing in the middle. Here comes one of the parings. How now, daughter! What makes that frontlet on? Methinks you are too much of late in the frown. Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to care for her frowning. Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue. So your face bids me... though you say nothing. Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool, but other of your insolent retinue do hourly carp and quarrel. I had thought, by making this well known unto you, to have found a safe redress, but now grow fearful that you protect this course. Which if you should, the fault would not scape censure, which might in their working do you that offence, which else were shame, that then necessity will call discreet proceeding. For, you trow, nuncle. The hedge-sparrow fed The cuckoo so long, That it had its head Bit off by its young! So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling. Are you our daughter? I would you would make use of that good wisdom, and put away these dispositions, that transform you from what you are. Doth any here know me? Why, this is not Lear! Doth Lear walk thus? Speak thus? Where are his eyes? Either his notion weakens, or his discernings are lethargied? Ha! Waking? 'Tis not so... Who is it that can tell me who I am? Lear's shadow. I would learn that. [Skipped item nr. 368] Knowledge, and reason, I should be false-persuaded I had daughters. Your name, fair gentlewoman? This admiration, sir, is much of the savour of other your new pranks. I do beseech you to understand my purposes aright. Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires, men so disordered, so debosht, and bold, that this our court shows like a riotous inn. The shame itself doth speak for instant remedy: Be, then, desired by her, that else will take the thing she begs. A little to disquantity your train, And the remainder, that shall still depend, to be such men which know themselves and you. Darkness and devils! Saddle my horses! Saddle my horses! Call my train together! Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee. Yet have I left a daughter. Woe, that too late repents. Saddle my horses! Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses. Pray, sir, be patient. Detested kite! Thou liest! Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in, and thy dearjudgement out! Go, go, my people! I am guiltless, as I am ignorant of what hath moved you. It may be so, my lord. Hear, nature, hear, dear goddess, hear! Into her womb convey sterility! If she must teem, create her child that be a thwart disnatured torment to her! That she may feel how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child. Away, away! But let his disposition have that scope that dotage gives it. What, Oswald, ho! This man hath had good counsel: A hundred knights! On every fancy, he may enguard his dotage with their powers, and hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say! Well, you may fear too far. Safer than trust too far. What he hath uttered I have writ my sister. If she sustain him and his hundred knights, when I've showed th'unfitness. Take you some company, and away to horse. Inform her full of my particular fear. This milky gentleness and course of yours, though I condemn not, yet, under pardon, you are much more attaskt for want of wisdom than praised for harmful mildness. A fox, when one has caught her, And such a daughter, Should sure to the slaughter, If my cap would buy a halter, So the fool follows after. Old fond eyes, beweep this cause again. I have another daughter. With her nails she'll flay thy wolvish visage. I'll resume the shape which thou dost think I have cast off for ever. Thou shalt find it, I warrant thee! Go to the Duchess of Cornwall with these letters. If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you. I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered your letter. Nuncle, canst tell why a snail has a house? No. To put's head in, not to give it away to his daughters, and leave his horns without a case. O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven! Keep me in temper: I would not be mad! Brother, a word! Descend: Brother, I say! My father watches: Fly this place. Intelligence is given where you are hid. You have now the good advantage of the night. I hear my father coming. In cunning I must draw my sword upon you. Seem to defend yourself. Fly, brother! Torches, torches! So, farewell. Father, father! Stop, stop! No help? Where's the villain? Here stood he, his sharp sword out, conjuring the moon to stand's auspicious mistress. Look, sir, I bleed. Where is the villain? Fled this way, sir, when by no means he could... Pursue him, ho! Go after. By no means what? Persuade me to the murder of your lordship. How now, my noble friend! I have heard strange news. If it be true, all vengeance comes too short. How dost, my lord? O madam, my old heart is cracked, is cracked! What, did my father's godson seek your life? Your Edgar? O lady, shame would have it hid! Was he not companion with the riotous knights that tend upon my father? I know not. Tis too bad, too bad. Yes, madam, he was of that consort. No marvel, then, 'tis they have put him on the old man's death, to have the expense and waste of his revenues. I have been from my sister well informed of them. If they come to sojourn at my house, I'll not be there. Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father a child-like office. - Is he pursued? - Ay, my good lord. For you, Edmund, whose virtue and obedience doth this instant so much commend itself, you shall be ours. You know not why we came to visit you. Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister, of differences, which I best thought it fit to answer from your home. Lay comforts to your bosom, and bestow your needful counsel to our business, which craves the instant use. I serve you, madam, Your Graces are right welcome. Filthy coward! Draw, you rascal! Come your ways! Help, ho! Stand, rogue, stand! You neat slave, strike! You come with letters against the king?! What is the matter? With you, goodman boy, an you please? Weapons! Arms! What's the matter here? Keep peace, upon your lives! He dies that strikes again. What is the matter? The messengers from our sister and the king. - What is your difference? Speak. - I am scarce in breath, my lord. No marvel. You cowardly rascal. One-trunk-inheriting slave, a superserviceable rogue, one that wouldst be a bawd in way of good service! Speak yet, how grew your quarrel? This ancient ruffian, whose life I've spared at suit of his gray beard. Let me tread him into mortar, and daub the wall of a jakes with him. Peace, sirrah! You beastly knave, know you no reverence? Yes, sir, but anger hath a privilege. Why art thou angry? That such a slave should wear a sword, who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these renege, affirm and turn their halcyon beaks with every gale and vary of their masters, knowing naught, like dogs, but following. Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool? What, art thou mad, old fellow? How fell you out? Say that. No contraries hold more antipathy than I and such a knave. - What's his offence? - His countenance likes me not. No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers? Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain: I have seen better faces in my time than that I see this instant. Fetch forth the stocks! You reverend braggart, we'll teach you! I am too old to learn. Call not your stocks for me. I serve the king, on whose employment I was sent to you. You shall do small respect, stocking his messenger. Fetch forth the stocks! There shall he sit till noon. Why, madam, if I were your father's dog, not messenger... Sir, being his knave, I will! This is a fellow of the self-same colour our sister speaks of. Let me beseech your Grace not to do so. The good king his master will check him for it. I'll answer that. Put in his legs! I am sorry for thee, tis the duke's pleasure. I'll entreat for thee. Pray, do not, sir, I've watched, and travelled hard, a good man's fortune may grow out at heels. Give you good morrow! The duke's to blame in this. This strange that they should depart, and not send back my messenger. As I learned, the night before there was no purpose in them of this remove. Poor Tom's a-cold... The foul fiend follows me... Away! Croack not, black angel! I have no food for thee. The foul fiend vexes him. He hath led him through fire and through flame... Fie, foh, and fum! Bless thee from whirlwinds, star-blasting, and taking! Hail to thee, noble master! He wears cruel garters. Horses are tied by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by the loins, and men by the legs. When a man's over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden nether-stocks. What's he that hath so much thy place mistook to set thee here? It is both he and she, - your son and daughter. - No. - Yes. - No, I say. - I say, yes. No, no, they would not! Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way. Fathers that wear rags Do make their children blind, But fathers that bear bags Shall see their children kind. Fortune, that arrant whore, Ne'er turns the key to the poor. O, how this mother swells up toward my heart! Down, thou climbing sorrow, thy element's below! Where is this daughter? With the earl, sir, here within. Follow me not! Stay here. How chance the king comes with so small a train? An thou hadst been set in the stocks for that question, thou hadst well deserved it. Why, fool? Let go thy hold when a great wheel runs down a hill, but the great one that goes up the hill, let him draw thee after. Where learned you this, fool? Not in the stocks, fool. Deny to speak with me? They have travelled all the night? Mere fetches. My dear lord! You know the fiery quality of the duke, how unremovable he is in his course. Vengeance! Death! Confusion! Fiery? Why, Gloster, Gloster, I'Id speak with the duke and his wife! Well, my good lord, I have informed them so. - Dost thou understand me, man? - Ay, my good lord. The king would speak with Cornwall, the dear father would with his daughter speak: Are they informed of this? My breath and blood! No! Tell the hot duke that... No, but not yet. May be he is not well, infirmity doth still neglect all office. I'll forbear. And am fallen out with my more headier will, to take the indisposed and sickly fit for the sound man. Death on my state! Wherefore should he sit here? No, this remotion of the duke and her is practice only. Give me my servant forth! Go tell the duke and's wife I'Id speak with them, now, presently: Bid them come forth and hear me, or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum till it cry sleep to death. I would have all well betwixt you. O me, my heart, my rising heart! But, down! - Good morrow to you both. - Hail to your Grace! I am glad to see your highness. Regan, I think you are! O, are you free? Some other time for that. Beloved Regan, thy sister's naught. She hath tied sharp-toothed unkindness, like a vulture, here. Thou'It not believe of how depraved a quality - O Regan! Take patience, sir, I have hope you less know how to value her desert. Say, how is that? I cannot think my sister in the least would fail her obligation: If, sir, perchance she have restrained the riots of your men... My curses on her! You should be ruled, and led by some discretion that discerns your state better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you, that to our sister you do make return. Say you have wronged her, sir. Ask her forgiveness? Dear daughter, I confess that I am old; age is unnecessary. On my knees I beg that you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed and food. Good sir, no more. These are unsightly tricks. Return you to my sister. Never, Regan! All the stored vengeances of heaven fall on her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones, you taking airs, with lameness! You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty, to fall and blast her pride! O the blest gods! So you will wish on me, when the rash mood is on. No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse! Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give thee over to harshness. Thou better know'st the bond of childhood; Thy half of the kingdom hast thou not forgot, wherein I thee endowed. Good sir, to the purpose. Who put my man in the stocks? I set him there, sir. But his own disorders deserved much less advancement. O heavens, if you love old men, if yourselves are old, take my part! O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand? Why not by the hand, sir? All's not offence that indiscretion finds and dotage terms so. I am now from home, and out of that provision which shall be needful. Sojourn with my sister, dismissing half your train. Return to her? And fifty men dismist? No, rather I abjure all roofs. Return with her? Persuade me rather to be a slave to this detested groom. - At your choice, sir. - Daughter! I prithee, do not make me mad. I will not trouble thee. Farewell, my child. We'll no more meet, no more see one another. But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter. Or rather a disease that's in my flesh, which I must needs call mine, thou art a boil, a plague-sore in my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee. Let shame come when it will. Mend when thou canst. I can be patient. I can stay with Regan, I and my hundred knights. Not altogether so, I looked not for you yet. If you will come to me, I entreat you to bring but five-and-twenty knights. - I gave you all! - And in good time you gave it. Made you my guardians, my depositaries, but kept a reservation to be followed with such a number. What need you five-and-twenty, ten or five, in a house where twice so many have a command to tend you? What need one? O, reason not the need. Our basest beggars are in the poorest thing superfluous. Allow not nature more than nature needs, man's life is cheap as beast's. You heavens, give me that patience! Patience I need! You see me here, you gods, a poor old man. If it be you that stir these daughters against their father, fool me not so much to bear it tamely, touch me with noble anger. No, you unnatural hags, I will have such revenges on you both that they shall be the terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep? No, I'll not weep. I have full cause of weeping, but this heart shall break into a hundred flaws, or e'er I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad! Most savage and unnatural! I like not this unnatural dealing! I have received a letter and locked it in my closet. These injuries the king now bears will be revenged. We must incline to the king. I will seek him. Go you, and maintain talk with the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived. Pray you, be careful. This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me that which my father loses. The younger rises when the old falls. End of Part One
