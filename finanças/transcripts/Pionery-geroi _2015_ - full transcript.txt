Children, let's start. A little silence, please. Sergeyev, where are you going? Can you explain to me what you are doing? What is happening ? Come here. Tell me what's wrong. I want to click my tongue, like the others. You can not do that. You are the lead singer. The others can't sing. But you sing very well, Sergeyev. Go back to your seat. All in your places! Eliseeva, this is not your row. Stop changing places. Stay calm. It's good. Above all, don't forget your positions, it's important. Very well. We'll start with the horses. Slowly. Then crescendo. The 1st group remains silent. At "plains of Russia" you start clicking your tongue very softly, very softly. When Sergeyev starts singing, you start piano, pianissimo. Is it clear to everyone? Eliseeva, Krasko, do you want me to get mad? Katya, let's go. Across the vast plains From Russia The heroes ride endlessly These are the heroes of the Soviet Red Army Stop. Sergeyev! What's happening ? You sleep ? I do not want. - What don't you want? - To sing. What do you want to do, then? What is the problem ? What's the matter with you ? Are you going to sing, yes or no? No. In this case, you come to see me right away and you say out loud in front of all your classmates: "I don't want to sing." I don't want to sing. Louder, Sergeyev. They should all be able to hear and understand that you betray them for no valid reason and on a whim. Just yesterday, your mother was crying in my office! You have no respect for your parents or your friends. You don't really care about your classmates. And you want to be a Pioneer... I don't want to sing! I will not sing! I want to click my tongue! That's all ! I come to see Dr. Gorsky. - You have an appointment ? - Yes, Olga Krasko. I call him. Dr. Gorsky, a lady is asking for you. Olga. Very well. 1st floor, office 301. - Put that on your shoes. - Thanks. It's not really a fantasy. When I ask you to tell me about your first fantasy, it's more a question of evoking a moment great sexual excitement which would have eventually led to masturbation. This word disgusts me. Don't be embarrassed. It is normal for children to explore their own bodies. Masturbation is natural, a necessary step in discovering your own body. I have never... Have you ever masturbated? Perhaps touched, caressed? No, I've never done that. Have you ever played doctor? I remember my first orgasm. Olga, for now we are talking about your experiences from 1 to 6 years. I say. I had my first orgasm at 4 years old. At what age ? 4 years. I thought you had never masturbated? It's true. It's a vocabulary problem, I think. But how could you have an orgasm at such a young age without using your hands? Everything happens in my head. Since I was little. I just squeeze my thighs and... So tell me about your first orgasm. I was lying on my bed. I imagined that I was going to school after being tortured by the Nazis. I was on the partisan side. I had crutches, bandages on my hands and legs, I was covered in blood... There, I arrive at school and all the children surround me and cheer me: "Olga, well done!" "Olga, you are one of the heroes!" And I feel so proud, so heroic. They all yell at me that I'm a hero. Did you enjoy? Please excuse me. So you had an orgasm at 4 years old? Yes. And very often afterwards, but in other contexts. When you masturbate now, is it always in the role of a partisan? No, I'm not completely crazy. It's all about my childhood. I just wanted to be one of the Pioneer heroes. - Who ? - You know, the Pioneer heroes. Valya Kotik, Marat Kozey, Zina Portnova... You are surprising, Olga. To be honest, I had never heard of anything like it. Girls, come see. Gorshkov says he saw a Volga, black and with the letters "M.E.S.". - It's not true ! - I can not believe. They are everywhere. They spy on Soviet children... and run them over with their car. Gorshkov talks nonsense. My uncle Kolya has a Volga. - You think he's a spy? - Maybe. - Did you look at his passport? - Nope. You are idiots. Forget Uncle Kolya, There are cars like that in every city. All with the same letters: MY. : "Death to Soviet Children". It's written very small. You can barely see it. I'm going to look at my uncle Kolya's passport. Imagine if it's a spy! I'm scared, girls. I have an icon in my pocket to protect me. How can she save you if Soviet children are hunted down all over the country? Are we going back together? I'm afraid. We have to find them and call the police. We will denounce them all. Gorshkov saw the car where? I didn't ask him. I didn't even change. We'll talk about it in the canteen. Don't tell anyone. Katya, hurry up, Palych is going to be pissed. Sergeyev, I was calling you. - Are you deaf or what? - Wait a second. You coming to eat ? I want to finish this level first. It's getting cold. What are we eating ? Meat, Sergeyev. Sergeyev... Eat vegetables, it's good for the brain, okay? Turn on the TV. I'm tired of staring at the back of your chair. Wait a second. You are really crazy, Sergeyev. - 150/100. - Normal. You can go, Andrey. I'm going to sleep. - Wake me up for the news. - OK. - Do you want cabbage soup? - No thanks. Grandma, can I take the last one? Alright, but don't wet your finger to turn the pages. I promise, but they are not easy to turn. I manage very well, me. Don't dirty it, otherwise I won't lend it to you anymore. Katya! Hush, pretend like we're not here. Look who it is. - Who is it ? - It's dad! Dad, it's you! I rang several times. Hello Sweetie. Are you still playing partisans? Shurka, you scared me. I just started distilling. I suspect it, it smells even in the hallway. - Go do your homework. - And don't open the door! What a stench! The raid lasted 12 days and revealed the deep failings of a society whose indifference only opens the way to all vices. Police recently dismantled a network operating in an unnamed Soviet apartment. It is a thriving business. This smuggler will be severely punished for his crimes. According to the penal code, he not only incurs a heavy fine, but also a prison sentence. In red, towns particularly affected by the vice of smuggling. These organizations often operate in the heart of the city and multiply the methods of operation. Police services are currently engaged in an all-out struggle against smuggling. This subject should not be taken lightly. We ask you, we implore you, not to turn a blind eye to such acts. If you know of someone breaking the law, contact law enforcement immediately. Why do you say nothing ? I just emptied my bag at your shitty shrink. I feel really fucked up. So, what does he recommend? He says I should find myself a farmer. Why a farmer? To make me plow three times a day. And what does it say about your panic attacks? They are due to the fact that I do not know a farmer. Therefore, I have many pent up desires. What a bastard, this Gorsky. He is boring and clearly lacking. - He helped me. - You kidding. He advised me to attend a surgical operation. And when I remember what I saw... It was awful, Olga. 50 kg of bloody meat right in front of me on a table... The surgeon asked me: "Are you okay? Do you feel like throwing up?" I said no. When he used the scalpel, I was not afraid of blood. I was looking at the exposed organs of this woman. They had their hands in his entrails. Was the operation long? - Within 40 minutes. - I were not able to. I wasn't scared, it's just that... It's not really... a human being, on the table. It's just... a piece of meat under anesthesia. It's just that... The concept of an immortal soul is bullshit. Some poetry. Gorsky is a jerk. He shouldn't have sent you there. He says I live in limbo and need clarity. So what ? Did you find any? Not really. Sergeyev, it's your birthday. We should go out and celebrate. We could invite Katya and Olga. I said no. Yes ? So what ? Let them stop their bullshit. It remains in the first person, it has been approved. If they don't want to make money, too bad for them, they'll end up working for free. Come on, Sergeyev. You really don't want a party? Why are you like this? We should celebrate that. Go yourself. We could go to Novgorod. Fuck Moscow! Stop moaning. I don't want to do anything, so let me go. Sergeyev, you weren't like that before. This is your fucking job, right? Who cares about this job. Resign. We can leave Moscow. You only have one word to say. It's your birthday. What's the use of money if you're lonely and unhappy? - Do you want to talk? - Yes. Well, not me. Hi Vanya. We have the green light, we can do whatever we want. Don't forget to send me the watch links by tomorrow, 8:30. Find catchy titles, it will avoid questions. We're throwing it on the air tonight. See you. Sergeyev... Why don't you write anymore? You have completely stopped. Leave me alone. I don't write anymore, because I'm tired of words. Words, I still have to find 4,000 by tonight. I don't want to go anywhere to celebrate anything. It pisses me off. I am fed up with all that. Come on, leave me alone. Like that. It bypasses the liver and the lungs to go directly to the heart. Then it dissolves and passes through the veins, direction the brain and the organs. What was that filth under the tub? The smell was unbearable. This stuff was rotting in my jar. I had a hell of a time cleaning it. Did you empty it? Grandma, no! Did you throw it all away? Of course, I threw it all away! What was I supposed to do with it? Why did you do that ? Are you gonna cry for that? It was for school, right? - Nope. - Then stop crying. - It was what ? - Leave me alone ! You really are the spitting image of your father. Where are you going ? You have to eat, first! Oh, and then shit... Olga... Thanks a lot. You have the script for tomorrow. The driver is late, he will be there in 15 minutes. OK. - Do you want some tea? - No thanks. - I'm going, then. - Hi. I turn off the TV I write you a letter To tell you that I can't watch this bullshit anymore I can not stand him anymore I drink and I think of you The phone rang I had to get up That I get dressed and go out for a run But I don't care I'm exhausted and sick I didn't sleep last night I'm waiting for an answer It's the only hope I have left Soon summer will end This summer... GLORY Why ? Are you up, sweetie? Everything is fine. I have for a second. What are you looking for ? He's there ! It's okay, we can go back to sleep. POLICE DEPARTMENTS Alright... And how is Olga? How are you. We got drunk not long ago. The class. Why are you depressed, Sergeyev? I don't see why we celebrate birthdays. We're supposed to be happy that day. Boy, you were. No it is wrong. Why should we be happy? Because we're alive. But it brings us closer to the end. What did you dream of when you were little? To perform a heroic act. Yes me too. - Did your dream come true? - Nope. And yours ? I came to Moscow. Like everyone. As a child, I wanted to invent a pill that would prevent people from dying. I was making sketches to show how she would reanimate the organs. I was experimenting in a jar. I would like to find these sketches. I could have saved humanity. I should perform a heroic deed. Save a life... Or become a heroic Mother. "There is always room for heroism in life." No, there is no room. For a heroic act? For life. You're in a mess, aren't you? No, I'm just fed up with it all... My life is just beginning and I'm already... at the end of my life. Stopped. It's the season, everyone is depressed. - How's the house going? - Nope. I do not have money. And then... I am fed up with everything. Stay. We'll take a beating. I can't, I have the millionaires' exhibition. Are we exposing the millionaires now? No, we're just exposing overpriced crusts for them. Well, okay, one shot and I'm off. That works. There is a car near the market. Marina saw one near a store. And you? Nothing for the moment. In my opinion, we should talk about it at school or call the police. It's super scary. What if they're here to hurt us? "What if..." If grandma had balls, it would be grandpa! It's too early to talk about it. Sergeyev, you watch, the girls and I are going. No, I don't want to go. - We should talk to the police. - Stop being a wimp! - It may be nothing. - Nope. The one near the market has the acronym "M.E.S." written in white. Bug ! Osipova, are you okay? You're an Octobrist, hide that. I have to pee, I'm going to the school bathroom. Coward! Okay. You stay there, I'll watch the door. If necessary, call the police. Hello. I'm in traffic jams. I'll be late for the audition. In two hours ? In fact, I had a little accident. No, nothing serious, but it might take some time. Shooting is tomorrow? In two days, then? OK. Thanks. Goodbye. Sergeyev, I believe it's an M.E.S. ! It's scrawled on the door. We must follow him! We are waiting there, he will eventually come out. Who ? Father Christmas, cretin... The spy, of course! We should notify the school, do you think? Go tell them, I stay here and watch. OK. What do we do now ? I can help you ? No. So move on, please. I am leaving. No, you are not leaving. Come on, push yourself. No. Here. Come on, take it! Why are you looking at me ? I don't want your money. What do you want ? Move over, I said. Where are your parents ? - They work. - Why aren't you at school? Are you OK ? I take you home? Sergeyev! Leave her! The police arrive. We know who you are. Stop this immediately! For Octobrists, this is shameful. I'll give you money for ice cream and you're off, okay? We stay until the police arrive. If you touch us, we scream. Why are we waiting for the police? - You kill Soviet children. - We know everything. - I see. - You'd better confess everything. That's enough, this little game. - Get away from my car. - No way ! My job is very important. I track spies. If you waste my time, they'll escape. Who are you ? Do you want to see my papers? MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR Can I go now? What's written on your door? It's nothing, fools have scratched it. I have to go, Pioneers. We are not yet Pioneers. Don't tell our school or we'll never be Pioneers. I will not do that. But stay on your guard. I could have been a spy. You have an M.E.S. Do you come across a lot of them in your surveys? I'm in a hurry. Goodbye. Goodbye. Well done, Sergeyev. You and your M.E.S... Here's the salad! Guys, stop working! - We're ready to party. - Kolya, pass the bread. You make room. Do we cut it now? - Girls, wine? - Yes. A whiskey. Wine, for me. Andrey, I would like to tell you... Raise a toast... You're the mastermind here. Thank you, Oleg. Happy birthday ! It is good, this wine. I said anything. It didn't come out the way I wanted. Good... Andrew. We have a little present for you. Thanks. - It's a dumbbell that wakes you up. - Cool. Open it. It's a dumbbell. That way, you can work out and know the time at the same time. - Great, thank you. - It took us a long time to choose. It will help me stay in shape. Happy birthday ! Andrey, I need you at Gazprom tomorrow. OK. It's your birthday ? Hold on. We should make a birthday calendar. Thanks. Happy birthday, Andrey. Many good things. Thanks. Will Potanin's text be ok tomorrow? - It will be ready for 8 o'clock, will you be ok? - Okay, but not later. Have fun, sorry I had to talk about work. - Enjoy! - Thanks. We eat? Give me a plate. Hello, Olga. Thanks. Katya came to see me. In the office. Yeah... Yes, I already have it. In Novgorod? I do not know. Maybe this weekend. OK Bye. Thanks. - Have you ever had a drink? - Yes, but we can start over. Come on, let's have a drink. Cheers ! - How are you ? - Thanks very much. Hello. What are you doing here ? You are waiting for someone ? No. I'm here, that's all. I leave you then. - Excuse me ! - Yes ? Do you hurt criminals? Are you a criminal? - Not me. - Which then ? Why are you not responding ? Are you hurting them? But no not at all. I do not believe that. Goodbye. Go back to work. You again? What are you doing here ? Let's go to my office. Do not be afraid. Tell me what's going on. Someone hurt you? No. Say, if I knew about a crime without reporting it... could I still become a Pioneer? What crime is it? I can not tell you. Good... It depends on what it is. If it's really a crime, you could not become a Pioneer. - Is it something serious? - Yes very. Do your parents hit you? No. - Do you want tea ? - No thanks. You are a very polite little girl. I'm going to make tea. So that no one has to die. Hello Katia. I can't hear you. OK that works. Hello ? Listen, Katya... I have a bad feeling. Can you come, please? Yes, I took quite a bit. I don't know. But I'm completely freaking out. Are you sure ? Tell them you forgot to turn off the iron. OK. No it'll be fine. I've just... a very bad feeling. Alright... Hi. Sit down. - Does everyone have them? - Yes. Take out your boxes, and put them nicely on the tables. You put them very nicely... on the tables. Stop giggling! - Are they all signed? - Yes ! - Dr. Lena, come in. - Hello. You can take them. Where is your box? - I left it at home. - What do you mean, you forgot her? Bring me your notebook. I'll write it down so you don't forget. BRING EXCREAMENT IN THE MATCHBOX Did you really forget? She will kill you... I can't. I managed to poop a little this morning, but I couldn't catch it. Bug... What do I have to do ? It's too shameful. Try to push harder. But don't you understand? I can't! Do you have a box? - Yes. - Give it to me. What are you doing ? Watch the door. Don't let anyone in. Katya, that's cheating! - Do you need it or not? - Do you think it will pass? - Katya, how are you? - Yes, wait a second. Here. What if they find out? But no... I won't say anything. Word of Octobrist. Katya, you are my best friend. How's work, Olga? What work ? The TV series. You may be tired. Yes, I'm tired. You should take a break. Rest. Dr. Gorsky, I can't take this vicious circle anymore. Do you remember the tale of the golden goose? They all end up clinging to her out of greed. A long chain of people clinging to each other and the golden goose. I feel like part of this chain. Except the goose is made of shit, not gold. I don't know how the story ends. Do you feel like your life is crap? It's not an impression, it's just a fact. Change jobs, then. Focus your energy on something else. What do you want to do ? No idea. Something that makes sense, I guess. I think I'm completely clueless. Look elsewhere, okay? Do I annoy you ? Go ahead, tell me what they deleted. I didn't even watch that shit. Here's what we're going to do: let them show me places that might suit them and I'll see if it's possible or not. If we're stuck, we'll do without, that's all. We have no reason to do it for free, anyway. Listen, go somewhere else, okay? Do something. Read a book. I can go to another room, if I'm in your way. Stop staring at me. My love, why don't you play a little? Take a break. Finish it later, it doesn't matter. I'm going to Novgorod. - Now ? In the middle of the night ? - I'll be back tomorrow. I can come with you ? No. Please. - Sergeyev, please. - I said no. Wait, at least take some clean underwear and socks. Why are you crying ? I like you. And you suffer. Goodbye. Do not drink too much. Here we are. Let's go! - Did I lock up? - It's red ! Come on, come on. Don't cross, it's red. Let it go ! Let's go. - Where are we going ? - I will not tell anything. What are you up to? It is a surprise. You will see ! Don't be afraid, you'll soon know everything. - Really ? - Really. - Good evening. - Good evening. I made reservations for 10 p.m. on Katya's behalf. Perfect. Have you made your choice ? Can we take a look together? We have 3 rooms available: cave, cosmos or gothic. - Can we see them? - Sure. The cave theme. Cool, right? There is a fireplace. What do you think about it ? Not bad. - And you ? You like ? - Yes it's not bad. I like. Look at this ! We are in space! Cool... Look, it's the Big Dipper. - Where ? - Just there ! - So what do you think? - Not bad. Cool ! It's a vampire room! We take this one! We take her. - And a bottle of Chivas. - Sure. The shower is great! - Really ? - Yes, there are handcuffs! I am your prisoner. Are you going to bite me? Come on, let's have a drink. Be careful. Come here, evil vampire... Come suck my blood. Go on ! It doesn't, does it? No, this place is nice. It's just that I'm knackered. Do you love me ? Yes a lot. You'll never leave her, will you? Never. We should go. Me you. Me you. GLORY Kill me, Katya. Kill me. It hurts too much. Thanks. No I do not want to. I do not want. Nope... You're welcome. I do not want ! Whore... Sorry ? What did you say ? I said, "Fuck." I perform a heroic act every day. I take the subway, or at least I try. I try to drive... and I panic in the middle of traffic. Imagine not being able to move around this huge city. I spend my time wondering how to avoid these panic attacks that destroy me every day. Who are destroying my life. Despite my phobias, I perform a heroic act every day. Why don't you say anything? I'm listening, Olga. I just want to be normal! Can you cure me? Can you cure me or not? You want a magic anti-phobia pill. But that pill doesn't exist, Olga. So work on my phobias with visualization exercises, or whatever you usually do. But stop dissecting me. My sex life has nothing to do with these panic attacks! You seem to question my professional abilities to treat your panic attacks. The fact that you say so vehemently that I'm doing it wrong shows how unwilling you are to do work on yourself. You constantly talk about your illness, but you refuse to part with it. It is she who feeds you. Because you are an empty shell. Olga, you are an actress. You need to break down every day. - Hello. - Hello. You are ? Olga Krasko. Olga, welcome. This is Oleg, the director. - Hello. Sit down. - Thanks. Have you read the script? The one you sent? Yes of course. Tanya, give her a copy. This is the story of a female doctor. Forensic pathologist, more precisely. The screenplay is still being written. Do you have any questions, Olga? Olga, is that it? That's it. No, no questions. We can start then. Misha, the camera. Should I read the text I received? I was told it might be another episode for the audition. Do you know the text? - Yes. - So go ahead, say the text. Misha, come on! Talk to me, not the camera. Am I just reciting the text? No, go sit over there. Misha... Misha! - You are ready ? - Excuse me, where is the body? - Sorry ? - The corpse. The corpse is right in front of you, okay? Misha, higher. - You are ready ? - Yes. Good grief, Misha! Unknown man, around 40 years old. Estimated death at 6:30 a.m. Penetrating brain injury, complicated by cerebral hypostasis syndrome. The medical examination revealed trauma associated... No, more like "unassociated trauma." The medical examination revealed unrelated trauma, a penetrating injury to the brain and a fracture of the temporal bones. The contusion is on the convex surface of the right temporal lobe. Hemorrhage from the ventricles, blood spots and abrasion on the left side of the skull. Stop. Ok good. Thanks a lot. Very well. I can try other replicas. These were a bit... No, it's useless. She obviously knows what she's talking about. It's okay with me. Goodbye. Nice to have met you. Also. Thanks. Goodbye. Help me ! Are you crazy? What are you doing ? He is drowning! Stop, let me go! He is drowning ! Help me ! - I do not know how to swim. - Shurka is drowning! Help me ! Shurka is drowning! Help me ! I beg you, help me! Shurka, hang on! This way ! Hurka! Help him, I beg you! Oh my God, it sank! Hurka! Jump! Jump! What are you waiting for ? Go get it! Jump! Go get it! Hurka! I, Andrey Sergeyev, join the ranks of the Pioneer Organization by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in the presence of my comrades, and promise to cherish my homeland, to live, study and struggle as the great Lenin intended, as the Communist Party teaches us and as required by the law of the Pioneers of the Soviet Union. Katya, what's going on? You are scared ? No. ... in the presence of my comrades... It's almost our turn. I really have to pee. I, Olga Krasko, join the ranks of the Pioneer Organization by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in the presence of my comrades, and solemnly promise to cherish my country, to live, study and struggle as the great Lenin intended, as the Communist Party teaches us and as required by the law of the Pioneers of the Soviet Union. I, Katya Eliseeva, join the ranks of the Pioneer Organization by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in the presence of... I can't. Me, Katya Eliseeva... Me, Katya Eliseeva... I can't. Me, Katya Eliseeva... I, Katya Eliseeva, join the ranks of the Pioneer Organization by Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, in the presence of my comrades, and solemnly promise to cherish my country, to live, study and struggle as the great Lenin intended, as the Communist Party teaches us and as required by the law of the Pioneers of the Soviet Union. - Get ready. - Always ready ! Are you fit to go home? Yes. I have to be in Moscow tonight. You know... You should rest instead. We had trouble resuscitating you. Drink vodka, take a nap. Are you from Moscow? No. I live there, that's all. Do you have a place to go? - Yes, my mother lives here. - Good luck, then. We'll wait for the medical examiner. Go have a drink. Thanks. - Olga? - What ? I have something to tell you. What ? Promise you won't tell anyone. Word of Octobrist. Word of Octobrist. But wait. You are a Pioneer now. Pioneer Word. I don't know salvation. Like that. Now you say, "Pioneer's Word." Pioneer Word. My grandfather is a smuggler. So what ? - You do not understand ? - Nope. He's a criminal and I protect him. - What do you say ? - What do you want me to say? - Are you still my girlfriend? - Sure. - Promise? - I promise. Don't tell anyone. Promised. Pioneer Word. Hi, Sergeyev. You can congratulate me, I finally finished this damn article. Yes, just in time. We should celebrate! I'm going to Olga's there. So what's up ? Seriously ? You're kidding ? A new job? Where ? OK, you tell me all about it. See you. It's me. Hi. Let's go ? It's so weird, seeing you like this. How is it ? The first two years were very hard. After the tonsure, it got a little better. To be honest, it freaks me out. Are you a monk then? We can say that, yes. What's next? Are you going to spend your life in a monastery? It's very strange... And super sad. Do not take it badly. No one can know what will happen. They allowed me to join the seminary. - I see. - I'm going to try. Are you going to become a priest? God willing. And you how are you ? I'm fine... I'm fine. How are you. - Are you going to see Katya? - Yes. In 3 months, it will already be 3 years. You will come ? I will try. It's a pity that she was never baptized. But she's in heaven, I'm sure. Yes, Katya is in heaven. She would have refused for it to be otherwise.
