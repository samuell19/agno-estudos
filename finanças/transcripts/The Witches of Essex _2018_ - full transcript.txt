Spooky music. Spooky music, nature sounds Spooky music. Spooky music. welcome to my latest para documentary which actually starts in the village of kanuda in Essex why kanuda I'm hoping to focus upon the ghostly legends associated with this church the Church of San Nicolas and also its neveress reputation for witchcraft and to examine more closely in detail the background and origins of some of the legends attached to the church which if to be believed would make canoed n' one of the most actively witchcraft infested areas in the entire world but of course as one knows through life that quite often once you've separated truth from fiction the true reality of these places is nothing more different than perhaps to other locations within the county of Essex and elsewhere and of course I'm hoping to examine them in much more detail but firstly let's look at the church here of San Nicolas it is of late medieval origin and this magnificent tower which stands on the hill promontory rises 123 feet above sea level and gives unparalleled views across a valley and certainly perhaps through history it may have been used as a possible defensive position and more certainly as a lookout and the tower was constructed as celebration for the English victory over the French following the Battle of Agincourt in the year 1415 and certainly today the tale can be seen from many locations at great distances as you approach this area and in sir she was safe quite a landmark which most people and particularly so boats using the nearby river have used as a navigable feature the actual origins of lean canoe Dhin dates back to sex and times and means basically hill of cannas people certainly King Canute on his campaigns across England had a base camp nearby and we'll have used this promontory as it afforded such a good view across the neighboring valleys and hills but firstly that's deal with why I'm here I'm hoping to after I visited the village of kanuda to travel over to Felton and Essex which has a personal association with me perhaps with a possible witch and witchcraft and to the village of monetary and miss lis in Essex which was the home base of Matthew Hopkins self-styled which find a general in the 17th century who during his time dispensed or should we say Cyril murdered where his assistant mr. stern over three hundred innocent women but this firstly look at the alleged reputation for witchcraft associated with this church and the village if we examine the court records and testimonials of actual witchcraft trials here in the village of kanuda we have to look firstly in the year 15 85 when a local spinster by the name of rose pie appeared before the court here accused of bewitching to death a 12 month old baby with a name of Jonas snow who lived at nearby scald hearse farm on this occasion the corpse showed leniency because the evidence to convict was insufficient but by cruel twist of fate although she was acquitted she actually died in prison because she wasn't able to pay her release fee and sadly five years later a lady by the name of Cicely making or good wife making appeared before the court here charged with practicing witchcraft here of course on this occasion they showed a degree of leniency they gave her five years to mend her ways and to return back to the teachings of Christ suffice to say that five years following she was back again before the same Court where instead of being executed or being imprisoned or tortured on this occasion by modern standards they showed a degree of leniency because she was excommunicated from the church but by the standards of medieval England that meant her soul was going to be consigned to hell as Cicely Macon was obviously a practicing Wiccan that wasn't much of a threat and as far as where we're from that period onwards she was able to live her life out peaceably after these two trials in canoed and there appears to be no further records indicating that any other citizens of this village were brought to trial accused of witchcraft which of course cannot be said for other parts of England and particularly in this county of Essex and Suffolk where witchcraft was considered to be quite a prevalent and common offense but what canoed in' is particularly known for or its legends associated with witchcraft and the rituals of witchcraft that are connected to this village of course to this church one of the most interesting characters that could be connected to the village of kanuda was a man by the name of George P king Gill who was born in 1813 and died in the village in the year 1909 and it's believed that he's buried somewhere in the churchyard but without the headstone George was known as a cunning man cunning in this case meant that he was a witch and had practiced he's worshipped to a horned God allegedly and during his lifetime although employed as a farm worker many people used to go to him for cures for many ailments and walks and also to improve crops and so on and so forth which he could give some kind of potion or make some kind of spell it is said that he walked along a hedgerow and touched it with a stick all the animals in the hedgerow would run out and they could easily be captured and caught again it was also said that if anyone crossed swords with George their life and indeed their prosperity in life could be severely hampered by what George could do in the manner of witches and spells the problem with the legend of Jaws picking Gil is that despite all his grand claims that are added to his reputation most of those were actually discovered as it were some fifty years after his death might a writer Eric maple who went around many old age people's homes interviewing some of the elderly residents to get their take upon the legend of Jaws peeking Gil and of course as one gets older one's memory tends to fade and certainly in this case his reputation was she would say somewhat elaborated by those who he spoke to it was said that if you went to his cottage just on the outskirts in the village I looked for the window during the evening time you could see his familiars in the form of mice suckling at his nipples and a manner of weird and wonderful tales associated with this man were researched by this writer of folklore Eric maple and of course going further into I believe the 1970s an American by the name of the thurb also added more to the reputation of George picking gel and so as a witch and as a cunning man he somehow tion out from all of the other witches there recorded and known who were operating within the county of Essex but George picking go was no fault and he was also a person that went to rewrite the rituals of his worship to witchcraft the Horned God and was also a man who was known to make some fairly grand statements for example he claimed that he had nine covens across the county of Essex and also believed in neighboring counties such as Hart this year and that on one occasion he had to showdown with another witch where he struck this witch down dead and of course all this added to his reputation as a man to be feared and certainly the villagers and indeed the church did fear him regardless he claimed that he could sit quietly smoking the pine why he would employ imps to bring in the crops from the farmer's field and that farmers would pay him extra money to be able to perform his miracles on their behalf another reputation added to the legend of Aleister Crowley for example was that he was at one time a disciple of George picking Gill and that he was eventually thrown out from the sect for his behavior which was considered to be outside their teachings and practices however further research in later years by other researchers can find no evidence of any connection between Aleister Crowley and George P Burdell and yet we can prove here that in later years people have added more to the legend of George picking Gill which today has given rise to the fact that kanuda is regarded as the focal point of witchcraft in the county of Essex and indeed if one needs further proof that the reputation of witchcraft in Canada was a concoction of the 19th century there's a local rhyme which says that there are always be six which is in the village three of cotton and three of silk well if that had been something which was claimed to be a medieval saying then surely it would not have been cotton it would have been war cotton was a discovery of the 19th century and certainly during the era of George picking Gil without going into more detail about his national claims and what he could do what he cannot do in his victims it was quite clear that he had a grudge against the church and that many times had run-ins with the local priest it is claimed that when he died he was walking through the churchyard at kanuda when at night daylight suddenly appeared from behind across a stone cross in the cemetery which reflected upon him and struck him dead nothing could be further than the truth he actually felt ill at home and he was taken to a hospice but eventually he died of old age and was subsequently buried in the churchyard certainly there are many many legends and attachments between the church and its association with witchcraft it is alleged that should a stone fall from the tower of the church it would indicate that one of the six witches inside the village had died and that another was due to take their place still adding to the legend of the tower and the witch is that so long as the church tower stands there will always be which is in the verge apparently anyone who walks around the tower at midnight could be forced to dance with witches and apparently at Halloween if you go around the tower seven times you will see a witch thirteen times you will become invisible if you run around the tower anti-clockwise on Halloween the devil will apparently appear before you and more interestingly if you run around the tower backwards three times a portal will appear before you and you will be able to travel back through time now of course I have yet to find any reference to any person has a claim to have experienced any of these experiences inside the church errotica Newton and again it's something that people have welded to the legend of George picking Gill and to which is inside the village which has made it such a fascinating place for study and particularly for folklore and local anecdotes I certainly don't feel that canoodle is perhaps any more haunted with witches or infested with which is whichever way you want to look at it and anywhere else in the country but why I find particularly intriguing about the whole deal is that if we go back to the 17th century we have the Witchfinder general Matthew Hopkins persecuting innocent people accusing them of being witches and in the 19th century we have George picking girl doing exactly the reverse but this time on church members of a local congregation a certain irony perhaps and one which of course has stuck quite firmly in my mind since I started to research this particular ah q mentoree I find these legends and local anecdotes to be fascinating but by and large I regard them as just that anecdotes and stories nothing more but they do add a rich character to the fabric of what the village of kanuda is to this day and sadly because of it it attracts a lot of people there at night and the church have been forced to add security gates to prevent people from entering at night and it is also fair to say that some people have gone into the churchyard and have seriously damaged headstone because on one portion of the churchyard the cemetery it is absolutely devoid of any headstones which have been ripped up and smashed up in the past which perhaps is a tragedy to the history of the village and our knowledge of the past apart from the church and the villages association with witchcraft the church has two notable ghostly legends attached to it the most notorious has been seen on a number of occasions a lady wearing a pope on it hat who has no face who's been seen to pass through the West Gate into car park at the front of the church and disappeared down before the river and on one night a lady was parked outside who had no knowledge of his ghostly reputations when she saw this apparition she saw that it had no facial features she was petrified and she fled in flight from this sighting and never to return again to the church no doubt today probably to recall that situation with horror and fear of what happened to her on that particular night but apart from that there's also been an alleged headless ghost seen inside the churchyard who's been known to deposit his victims in neighboring ditches quite how true any of these legends are one can only conjecture eyes but I would have thought that the occasion of the lady who saw the figure with a pope boniface is probably one of the more truthful elements attached to any of the ghostly sightings here but what is more particularly worrying and frightening for any visitors to this churchyard are its associations with witches and some of the rituals which have been seen and performed inside this very active churchyard I'm actually standing outside this rather delightful timber-frame building in the village of Felsted on Essex which as you can see was built by George boot in the year 50 96 certainly today it stands out as an interesting feature and particularly so when its opposite the guild hall and the beautiful church here and of course Felsted is noted for its public score but coming back to this building it also has an addition which you don't find on any other buildings in this area and that is known locally as the felch did hang and allegedly depicts according to the Builder a carving of his wife she being a rather plain and ugly woman he decided to display that more as a joke rather than with reference to anything else but if you look more closely at this figure which is actually a support bracket you'll notice that she has cloven feet and she also has exposed breasts and appears to be restrained or held back and contained on the side of the building I think the truth here is that the figure was carved as a grotesque to ward off evil we have only got to go back three years earlier in the year 1593 when a local spinster at the age of 59 years a woman by the name of Alice Albert was declared to be a witch according to a local farmer she had hexed a number of his animals which fell ill and diet and she apparently had bewitched them and in order to gain retribution against her he complained to the local magistrate here who issued a warrant for her arrest and she was taken to Chun soo decisis where along with a number of other innocent women she was judged guilty of which car and she was Punk one can also imagine that she was probably tortured a great length where under torture under pressure she may have admitted to anything at all but there the story doesn't quite end and this is where I come into the picture a few years ago I came to this village to shoot a piece on George boot house and some of the other buildings and the church and as I was carrying my camera across the road to get a better view of George boot house I was standing in a central position as you can see from this short clip here when I recorded the most unusual EVP if you listen closely the background audios completely wiped out and its substituted by this very evil sounding voice a number of voice analysts have listened to this at live and have declared that they can find no logical reasonable explanation for that voice to be there and so I think it's fair to say a most certain to say that that is EVP or electronic voice phenomena which was inadvertently recorded by me as I carried the camera across the road could there be an association between that EVP the legend of George boot house and the poor spinster Alice Albert and of course today I can't answer that question I can only surmise that there may be a tenuous connection perhaps many centuries ago when George boot built this beautiful house that Alice Albert had lived very local to where the restaurant is today and pants Alice Albert spirit still reigns supreme in this part of the village of Felsted as I said I'm only speculating it's just idle speculation that only from what I recovered on camera certainly a strange place to recall evey in the middle of the busy road but it happened and so did of course the legend of Alice Albert and the self dead hag which today still intrigues and fascinates many tourists that come to this area and so now we move on to another area much notably witchcraft but in later years in fact in the 17th century the final part of my documentary on the Essex witches actually brings me to the villages of mists near Manningtree in fact I'm standing within the grounds of mystery towers Manningtree miss lis will always be connected with one man the Nemesis of all witches in the 17th century a man by the name of Matthew Hopkins the son of a Puritan priest who was born in great venom in Suffolk in the year 1620 and following the death of his father who was quite a wealthy man owning tenements at framlingham Castle in Suffolk he came to this area with a hundred marks as part of his father's will where he purchased the mystery forum Hotel today there is still a mystery for hotel but unfortunately it's not the original building that Hopkins purchased it was torn down much earlier and a later version was built in the year 1735 whilst here he came across an alleged witchcraft trial that was being prosecuted at the behest of villagers by a man of the name of John Stone he actually appeared at the trial and listened to how stone presented his evidence and obviously at that point decided to throw his bottom with Stern to carry out their own investigations into witchcraft because it was paint ly obvious that people were willing to pay for the death of other people and before long they had actually formed a company which involved three professional which identify as these were women who knew the signs of the witch and stone employers of which pricker they were certainly psychopaths they had no feelings or remorse for their victims and they were handsomely rewarded not only to dispose of alleged witches by identifying them but also innocence that other people were prepared to pay good sums of cash for to be rid of them in fact by the end of his reign he had accrued the princely sum of a thousand pounds which by modern standards were placing within a level close to being a millionaire so it was certainly a very very profitable exercise and the sad part about all of this was the fact that this occurred during the English Civil War so there was no proper lawful jurisdiction by authorities because some could be under the controlled Royalists others could be under the control of the parliamentarians and so Hopkins was able to work within this grey area and he even had a letter of Good Conduct to allowing through two different areas in order to carry out his alleged persecutions of witches it is believed by the end of his reign that he had murdered over 300 women and also some men too and on one occasion had persecuted an elderly priest who he accused of being a witch quite clearly Hopkins had gone beyond his dream it is a Witchfinder general and was a psychopath completely out of control now why would people want somebody persecuted as a witch well most of his victims were poor painless elderly widows easy victims to torture and to confess to alleged crimes and as a result of their prosecution they would receive a financial settlement from the grateful villages and the reasons behind all of this mostly were the fact that the great play existed during that period of history and of course there were a number of ailments and diseases affecting livestock which all could be attributed to the work of a witch nobody really understood the mechanics of science at that period of history it was still very much in its infancy and particularly with medicine and so if somebody fell sick or if their animals fell ill it had to be the work of a witch of course there is no testimony following any of these persecutions that any of these animals or people recovered from their alleged ailments as a result of a witch being persecuted and wired and certainly during their early days here in Miss Lear Manningtree they prosecuted and had hung 19 women from this area who were completely innocent of any crime of witchcraft in fact during the early days in the year 1645 most of their early victims were tried by water at the infamous hopping bridge which can still be seen today along the walls at miss Li and here victims were tied to chairs and thrown over the side into the pond below if they died they were clearly innocent but if they floated back to the surface they were obviously guilty as a witch and they were later taken to Colchester where they were tried and hung and indeed today in the castle basement are the remains of the cells in which a number of his poor women were incarcerated but it can be considered that they would have been cold they would been damp and the victims would have been stripped naked and beaten other methods to detect witches could be signs of a witch particularly if people have walks or moles these are normally the signs of witches apparently or if people have an extra nipple which is definitely the mark of the devil and so on and so forth I in fact have a birthmark on my back which quite clearly could indicate that I'm a witch because if you look at this birthmark it actually resembles a witch on the broom stick so had I lived in the 17th century and was wrongly unfortunately accused of being a witch I would not legally have been able to defend myself such was this savagery and the bigotry of that period of history Methos they employ to extract confessions and to prove their guilt that was simply by using a blunt knife placed against their arms and of course a blunt knife would not cut their skin and with not draw blood which was a sure sign of witchcraft or by using a knife with a retractable blade so that the knife will appear to pass through the victims arm and be retracted with no trace of any blood or indeed any customers skin which was also a sure sign of witchcraft it's believed that Hopkins drew his inspiration from the works of King James the first who wrote the book on demonology it is also suggested that for a period he was employed as a clock in Holland where he learnt much of the continental methods of detecting which is all bar one of his victims were hung only one was burnt at the stake whereas that practice of burning at the state of witches was fairly commonplace throughout Europe one of the questions that arises is why didn't Hopkins visit Keynesian and Essex and the suggestion is that he was too terrified after which he's there well as I've shown in the earlier part of my documentary the alleged witchcraft in the village was more a confection of the 19th century and he had no reasonable call to go there and I'm very sure that someone like Hopkins would not easily be dissuaded from attending a village which was noted to be haunted with witches it is interesting to note that Hopkins produced in the year 16 47 the discovery of witches which he used in his defense against the priests John gall at Great Staunton in Huntingdon Sher who denounced him as a witch Huntingdon was perhaps his last final battle and he was forced to retreat and suffering from an illness of a chest infection he went back to his home in Manningtree in south street which in fact today is an empty lot next to the red line public house where he died of his illness within hours Hopkins have been buried in the grounds of miss lis church not this churchyard but another church which sadly no longer exists today and so we are unable to place exactly where Hopkins is interred but suffice to say that he legacy lives on for eternity the discovery of witches was taken across to America by the early settlers to the town of Salem in Massachusetts where it was put to good employment in another reign of terror which is known today as a Salem witch trials today the legacy of Matthew Hopkins still lives on in the form of his ghosts apparently he has been seen at hopping bridge walking along the walls area facing the river store also ghostly and mysterious screams have been heard coming across from the salt marsh which is believed to be the spirits surface on his victims he apparently has been heard inside the mystery horn hotel on the upper floor walking up and down as a restless spirit perhaps and lastly at the White Hart Hotel a Manningtree where his spirit is allegedly said to haunt quite how true any of these stories are I cannot attest but I can say that for a long long time thereafter the legacy of Matthew Hopkins will live on in this area perhaps as a vessel to sell tourism more perhaps for people to come and reminisce over the terrible deeds carried out by two men in the 17th century [Spooky Music] Horse gallops [Spooky Music] well I've arrived to a church which for me has many fond memories having been here on numerous occasions in the past I'm actually asked some evans church on the island of mercy and essex and this is actually the eastern side of the island there is another church at the western end this particular church has an interesting history it took over 200 years to construct and dates from the 12th 13th 14th and 15th centuries respectively so there's been an ongoing development here over the centuries which has brought us today to this fine church that stands here as testament to the craftsmanship of the medieval past and very light and airy has a wonderful ambiance and it's certainly something that I'd love to come back to whenever I have the occasion and it's great to be back here today and usually perhaps it's sunny outside and there is very little wind which gives me great opportunity to share with you one of the legends outside associated with this church let's have a wander around this church has probably got the most unusual pulpit which I've seen anywhere the notice of the pulpit and it's hourglass shape is actually created on top of a column and the reason for that simply was up until 1920 this church was filled with box pews so the height of the pews would have touched just below the actual paneling here from which the priest would stand please are a rare sight in churches mostly ones we find are made from wood but this is a casting brass and probably dates to the 19th stroke early 20th century it's a particularly fine piece and obviously well looked after and well cleaned one can just imagine the prohibitive cost even for that period of history but nevertheless it's quite beautiful with no [Music] there are are two interesting exhibits I want to share with you now part of the church furniture isn't work one is this wooden frame plaque to the memory of the tenor Colonel Edward Bellamy citizen and fishmonger late of this parish who deceased the 28th of August in the year at the age of 59 and considering its age and how far actually goes back and the fact that it's still here and it's so well perfectly preserved this is indeed an enjoyable rarity to actually see inside a church today and next to it we have a staircase a medieval staircase in stone which goes up but comes out at the top there which was originally access to the rude loft and the Rood screen used to literally run across here separating the chancel from the nave and of course the Rood screen has long since disappeared but there are still references to the fact that it actually existed and to see it as a curiosity is quite fun really a detail which I always appreciate particularly so in medieval churches and it are these large archways which separate this part of the Church of the nave from the adjoining chapel from the detail that I can see these would probably date to the late 14th early 15th century and even to this day the preservation of the detail the carving is is still there there's virtually no damage and it seems to have survived history fairly well and certainly accredit to the Churchill authorities here which maintained this building in such a high state of renovation and repair [Music] just over here we have a rather attractive late 14:30 15th century medieval font with ecclesiastical carvings around the tunnel sides which is particularly interesting this has much closer look certainly just looking at this piece listen fine carving here of arches and here is an empty space I can only assume at some point this may have contained an image of a now prescribed Saint which may have been taken away there's certainly other panels which attests to the fact that there may have been something else there originally but having said all that the detail was still very strong it's albeit slightly chipped and damaged and after centuries have used them bearing some signs of graffiti it's still very much here today and very much used and enjoyed by the people that celebrate at this church there are two historical characters attached to this church which I wish to go into some detail with one I will need to travel outside to two grave of a 15 year old girl and the other perhaps to a famous author and was also the priest here in the nineteenth century but let's wander outside first and let's look at the legend of Sarah wrench [Music] one of the most unusual and perhaps one of the saddest burials here in the church art at some edmonds Church in East mercy and Essex is an iron cage grave burying the legend of Sarah wrench who died May the 6th 1848 aged 15 years and five months but she is buried alone in unconsecrated ground nobody actually knows who sarah wrench was and certainly there's no record of her birth which in those days wasn't particularly unusual unfortunately but for a burial to take place here in East mercy from somebody from Feldon and there's no record of her death or birth then it seems rather odd to say the very least but anyway I digress a lot of people believe that this grave had this iron cage or more safe placed over it to prevent a group of people known as resurrectionists or burkas from removing her body and selling it for medical research first of all let's examine the fact that the Resurrectionist as they were known may have been intent on removing her body to be sold to a medical school either in London or Cambridge which would have been the nearest medical schools for that period of history where obviously they would have received a bountiful price for her corpse that to me is a rather fanciful explanation so now we must look at the facts in more detail Sarah was a native of children village which in those days would have taken by a horse a cart probably around 40 minutes only terribly unmade roads which existed in those days and say just for example if it was a grave robber he would have to know that she had recently died he would also have to know that she has been buried here for him to even dream of removing the corpse and taking it by cart to the nearest railway station of that period which was cultures there which would have taken probably two or three hours on the roads that existed and then the long journey into London but then having to explain to people why they're carrying a cadaver of a young girl and then of course if you're a resident here on Murray Island you would have to know somebody in a medical school in London who would be prepared to break the law on by this corpse and I'm coming back again to what the locals believed that she was at the time of her death it was suggested that she was which and that was the reason she was buried with an iron cage to prevent her from rising again and tormenting the locals by modern science and understanding of the world this is a completely ridiculous notion but understandable when you look at the mindset as I've explained of the people from that period I find the whole event surrounding her death and also the the grave robbers evolved highly repellant really and quite sad when you look at things and examine them under a modern light we have to remember for example between 1506 and 1750 to such was the interest in the human anatomy by medical schools that the supply human bodies cadavers had completely dried up and so they decided to introduce a piece of legislation which was known as the murder Act which allowed convicted felons who were executed as part of their punishment for their bodies to be taken away for free by medical schools for their medical classes and of course as the interest in medical science grew and blossomed and particularly so in Edinburgh and in London where medical schools they were receiving students from all over the world such was the interest the supply of convicted bodies grew less and less because also at the same time it reflected a social change insist no longer were people going to be executed for the most minor of offenses and so that ready supply of bodies completely dried up there so the only course for further action to enable them to continue their business was to employ or to do business with these people that were known as resurrectionists or burkas burka comes from Messrs Birkin hare who were Irish immigrants living in Edinburgh or I believe between 1827 and 1828 murdered I believe up to 16 people and solved their bodies to an unscrupulous doctor at an Edinburgh Medical School and that these supply of bodies were taken without question by the said medical school and when they were eventually caught and convicted and executed no punishment was dealt out to the doctors involved that the medical practices and in fact in the case of Burke his skeleton was placed on public display his body was deceptive book covers were made from his skin and also appointment card folders were also created from his skin the end result was that after Burke and Hare were arrested and convicted there was a huge landslide in change with regard to the care of bodies after death because up until then nobody had really given it a second thought after they brought in legislation they decided that in future all deaths should be properly registered with certificates that accompany each corpse to ensure that those who had control over a corpse had the correct paperwork giving them authorization to do so which obviously cuts out the middleman the tomb robber who would remove these bodies for sale so in 1848 here in East merci I can give you a rough idea of what life was like here which it was fairly harsh there was mostly farmers and people who made their living from the sea they weren't particularly wealthy of course there there were landowners but importantly this she was a forgotten corner of United Kingdom wine earth would anybody want to place a mock safe over a young girl's grave my view whichever the legend is with regard to Sarah wrench is that she was not a witch she was a victim of a narrowed social mentality which pervaded in England at that time I think that an according to the facts that she was indeed pregnant I think that in her village she was confronted over her pregnancy and she obviously didn't wish to name the father of the child and so she lied and she may have said something to the effect that she had been raped by demon or or something like that what you have to understand is that in the year 1848 and despite the Witchcraft Trials of the 17th century people still here and particularly so in Essex and in Suffolk had these deep-rooted fears of the devil and almost peasant virus as it were which completely possessed the minds of most god-fearing Christians who lived in these remote rural districts and if proof be needed the last witch trial occurred in Essex actually in the 1860s in the village of still heading them where the villagers decided that a deaf and dumb mute who was believed to be French a man by the name of dummy was a witch and he was tried by being doused into water as a result this poor man caught pneumonia and died but best beside the point it shows though that this mentality surrounding the paranormal and surrounding the works of the devil still held very strongly in people's minds and regardless of whatever people would say to this day it's a very very sad story but one which I'm sure you will find interesting if not a little sympathetic to this poor young lady and thank you Sarah and I hope that you can spend the rest of your time in peace and away from all those people who perhaps misjudge you so badly and now we return back inside to the church [Music] that was indeed an interesting tale albeit rather sad and perhaps sadder for the fact that nobody knows very little about this young lady but at least by being buried here in this beautiful quiet country church or at least give her centuries of peace from a torment that she must have suffered as a child and that brings me on to another famous incumbent of this church a man by the name of Sabine baring-gould who was the rector here between 1871 and 1882 and what can I say about this man he was probably one of the most prodigious rioters of the period in fact the British Library can record at one period that the majority of submissions for registration by a library were actually works written by Baron Gord he came here as he believed as a form of punishment and nobody knows what the punishment was for it was certainly known that he was a very open-minded free-thinking individual and probably may have travelled on some toes somewhere in the church hierarchy but he certainly wasn't happy about being posted to this church he found the Islanders very difficult people to get along with he found them to be very suspicious and wary of outsiders for which of course baring-gould was certainly a very interesting man while he was here as part of his presumed punishment he was able to write a very famous hymn but the name of onward Christian soldiers which to anybody associated with the Christian faith may have heard over the years being played literally anywhere in the world a very very popular tune he also wrote a book on the island and characterized the people on the island as part of this thriller which he wrote and certainly even to this day people can attest to some of the descriptions of the characters in this novel to people that actually existed during ferrying God's time and perhaps that was his form of revenge against them I personally feel that the church rather than in punishing him by sitting here they realized that this man was a literary genius and thought that perhaps by sending him to a very quite post such as here it would enable him to get on with his work I don't think that they particularly prescribed against him he was certainly a very interesting man he was entirely self educated and traveled freely across the continent on his many travels where he acquired great knowledge picked up some interesting items which I believe some of which are still here in this church today during his period here he actually renovated the church for his own personal expense he was certainly a man of certain means and if you look in a number of the windows you will see some sixteenth and seventeenth-century round doors which I believed to be of a continental origin and perhaps baring-gould acquired these on his travels and had been put into the windows here because often there there is no sign of any medieval glass and the chancel window as beautiful as it is is certainly a late Victorian masterpiece but let's carry on with the tour inside you'll have to excuse the rather strong light that's coming for the church windows but here is an interesting exhibit which is a reconstructed niche and you can see that there are cracks in the stonework where it's been completely rebuilt this unfortunately is not an uncommon phenomenon in many churches of this period as I've already explained on earlier videos when the church went through a period of Reformation many things that were regarded as idolatry or to Catholic were destroyed by the Protestants and it would appear that in the early days at least this was actually removed and broken up but fortunately it's been recovered and it's been put back into place but here of course would have stood a statue probably of one of the Saints and fortunately only the other day I was able to travel over to fingering her Church which has such a statue of some Margaret which had been removed a head was partially broken and she was buried into the rubble at the back of the niche and filled in and it was only during the period of renovation inside the church that she was rediscovered and put back onto display which is such a terrible shame these beautiful objects of artwork these handcrafted by people these were painted by artists and yet they were so unceremoniously disregarded and discarded as refuse but here at least the lesions that exist in this hope that perhaps one day the snatcher which originally filled this dad made me rediscovered and put back on to display there's a story I want to share with you an anecdote about baring-gould and he had apparently 15 children in fact he had so many children that on one occasion he had a party at the vicarage and he picked up a little girl he went oh you're pretty whose little girl are you and she burst into tears and exclaimed but I'm yours daddy he was so wrapped up in his work and his life they'd actually forgotten the identities of his own children this shows you the eccentricity of that man but a really nice story [Music] below through here this wave of energy all the time might be cold in here it certainly feels warm in some way beautiful on a spiritual level I'm actually feeling and I can actually see on the altar area an impression in my mind of a man and priest and a boy and the boy wearing a white surplice as though he may have been in a choir whether this was a vicar and his son or some other relation I don't know but they feel very warm nothing negative here at all well unfortunately time is drawing to a close here it's starting to get dark and this beautiful light naturally illuminated Church is slowly drawing into darkness I hope you've enjoyed the towels that I've shared with you today and particularly appertaining to Sabine Barry gold and of course poor Sara wrench and had been able to enjoy the beauty of this building which for me is crucially important [Music] Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Hadley was first constructed by hubert de burgh in 1215 and the site chosen was in the high natural ridge constructed from London clay de Berg realized the site afforded good views across the Thames Estuary and the castle would help to protect London from raids by French warships the Kentish rag stone used was brought by raft across the Thames from Kent from where it was quarried and a ramp was constructed to haul the stone from the foreshore which was until the 18th century at the base of the hill land Reclamation's pushed the sea much further back which exists to this day as cultivated farmland Hubert was a trusted follower of King John and custodian of two important role castles at Windsor and over a Dover he was soon to prove his great military skill by successfully defending the castle during a fierce siege in 1216 de Burgh was later given a license to Crenna late in 1230 under Henry the 3rd but by 12:39 his relationship with the King had deteriorated to such an extent that the Berg was arrested and had his possessions including Hadley stripped from him the castle by the 1250s had fallen into neglect and despite some investment after it was given to Queen Elinor in 1273 it remained in relatively poor condition a new hall and an adjacent solar complex were built at the castle around 1290 but collapsed due to subsidence shortly afterwards in 1299 the castle was given to Queen Margaret and Edward the third acquired the castle in 1330 and between 1361 and 1363 the internal buildings were renovated which was completed by 1365 after 1540 for the estate began to be broken up first the parks were sold and then the castle itself bought by Lord Richard rich from Edward VIII 6-4 700 in 1551 rich dismantled the castle for the value of its stone primarily between 1551 and 1575 and the castle now thoroughly ruined passed through Rich's descendants the English painter John Constable visited Hadley in 1814 and made a drawing of the castle as preparation for ten old sketches and a single painting the old painting Hadley Castle was produced in 1829 and exhibited of the Royal Academy in the same year William Booth Purchase Hadley Castle and its surrounding site in 1891 for the use of the Salvation Army which established a farm to Train the English poor prior to them being sent overseas to the British colonies considerable so science and slippage on the ridge occurred between 1898 and 1923 causing a collapse of the southern curtain wall The Salvation Army gave the castle to the Ministry of Works in 1948 and it is now owned by English heritage and classed as a scheduled monument and a great one initiative building subsidence and land slips have continued the north east tower largely collapsed in the 1950s and further major slippage ease occurred in 1969 1970 and 2002 today I'm fortunate to be able to visit the ruins of Hadley Castle and Essex very recently I featured a para documentary on Essex witches the center of which was based upon the village of kanuda which of course was central to that particular documentary and also featuring the arch nemesis of all which is self-styled Witchfinder general Matthew Hopkins and of course it wasn't long before comments were raised as to why I never featured perhaps Essex is most famous cunning man a man by the name of James Merle and the reason simply for that was that the para documentary was essentially rooted in kanuda and also miss Lee Manning Terry because the two fitted quite nicely within the sense of one group of people that were alleged to persecute church-going people and then an alleged churchgoer persecuting alleged witches and so it featured quite well but of course within the remit of that there was not enough time to talk about James Merle and his life and his claims James Merrill was born at Rochford in Essex in around the year 1780 won and in 1785 he was baptized and grew up to become a fairly well-adjusted normal young man except for his material gifts accorded to him according to legend but a fact that he was the seventh son of a seventh son and these gifts were pivotal for what James Merrill became in later life a well-known cunning man a man who was alleged to have gifts which included in the empowers herbal remedies divining for lost objects astrology and clairvoyance to name but a few in around 1812 James decided to become a cobbler and set himself up with a shop at Hadley in Essex as his client base grew his knowledge grew and more more people including the wealthy were travelling from much further afield traveling down from London Suffolk half Fisher and even further abroad to seek him out because of his acclaimed reputation as a seer and cunning pair he possessed a tremendous knowledge of herbal remedies medicine and astrology and owned an expensive library of magical books and papers although none of these have survived his library is said to have contained the works of Henry Cornelius Agrippa nichelle Nostradamus and William Lily for his consultation room he allegedly used the front room of his cottage which was festooned with all types of curves tied to the beams and slowly drying out for future remedies and clients in the corner of that room he had an extremely large wooden chest which contains various texts and books relating to his craft as a cunning man he also had a magical knife a human skull and a writing desk but what was interesting amongst his collection was a large brass telescope now one can assume that the telescope was used for looking at the sky and that the Stars but as I believe part of his reputation as a cunning man relied extensively on local intelligence information that he could pick up or quire locally either directly from the individual themselves quite mean obviously or by a third party or in this case by observing people through his telescope seeing what people were up to in a day to day basis so that when they came to him he may have had copious details of notes pertaining to that individual which he could then reveal which would obviously amaze and surprise the person concerned and reinforced his belief in him as a cunning man or mount witch on a day-to-day basis morale would often be seen wandering around the town of Hadley as it became or wandering to the ruins of the old castle where Deeping thought he was seeing muttering or whispering to himself as he walked along no doubt thinking about particular clients or causing his thirty was occupied with at that particular time but one thing about Merrill people didn't fear him people adored him because if he's wiseness his wisdom and his ability and creativity in the way that he could help or assist people now bearing in mind as i've always mentioned in all of my paradox men thérèse people were deeply superstitious and of course talking of the black magic and the black arts with frightened people particularly devout church-going folk and of course Merle was a man who had deeply held religious beliefs he was a devout Christian he was perhaps so well-versed on the Bible New Testament that he could quote word-for-word a particular psalm much better than the local priest it would have to research anything that Merle had told him as quotes from the Bible such was his ability and his memory and his memory is certainly key to his ability as a cunning man he challenged me services usually Halfpenny for curing warts and other simple herbal remedies half a crown to break a spell cast by another witch and the same one for his famous which was all spells but if he was asked to call upon the aid of high spirits he were charged even more though that magical cure was required then he was set about by raising spirits or good angels as he described them certainly most cunning men of that period were eccentrics and James Morel was second to none and his own eccentricities how would people describe him there are certainly no photographs they exist to this day there are drawings based upon his description but nothing more and this is how he was described he was a small man in stature but had an aura of great authority with piercing blue eyes the ruddy complexion went out and about in the village she wore bobtail coat and a fashionable hard hat and always carried an umbrella he was a married man and then also allegedly had up to 20 children although no records can be verified to actually establish that as a fact he also had what he called a magical mirror which is something that he used to stare into as a seer to be able to draw more closely into a particular problem brought to him by a client and the mirror also served as a lost property finder allegedly because of his divinations he was able to see and locate the missing item and had a great thought and the claim for that particular reputation as an astrologer he was incredibly accurate and many of his predictions did come true maybe not in the immediate future but certainly many years hence with regard to anything spiritual there was nothing that James Merrill could not do and nothing of course he he would refuse to do to help other people certainly a far cry from the reputation of George picking Gill who came later here we have a man that was very deeply associated with the local village and with the church people held him in great respect people didn't fear him people came to him for help and for assistance and in return he gave their systems he never claimed to call upon imps or demons to fight a particular enemy or evil instead he used what we would call today as white magic perhaps a predecessor of the modern Wiccan movement perhaps one of his claims was that he had a magical telescope now whether it was the brass telescope that I mentioned earlier or some other telescope this telescope was able to see through walls now remember as I came back to earlier about James Morel taking notes and observing people I think that was the purpose it was one of the same items which he used to observe people from a distance from the telescope because if he looks at people from a great distance they would never have seen him and so anything that he could attest to a later date was obviously a magic a divination which has come to him through the white forces that surround him he was never a man who was regarded as being Woolley and his predictions or his conduct he was somebody that people very deeply admired of local Fisher perhaps he also had a talismanic copper bracelet with which he was able to detect evil online people I think in truth that James Morel was a uniquely gifted psychologist I think that the people he came across he could get vibes off them he very quickly was able to work out whether somebody was good or bad and obviously there was a level of success attached to that because certainly for here the copper bracelet that he wore was one of the popular gimmicks that he employed and his trade as a seer and I certainly think that people that had a guilty secret were no longer to hold that secret if they were in the presence of James Morel he had that cunning ability to find and seek the truth an interesting story which I think is largely apocryphal but relates to James Morel and that concerns one of his which is bottled now his witches bottles were made out of metal they were cast by local blacksmith they weren't particularly easy to make as many could break in the firing process but they use an effectiveness particularly on a psychological basis around the town of Hadley was particularly effective one particular famous case was a young girl who was barking like a dog maril diagnose that she was suffering from witchcraft and so using one of these Oh spirit bottles will which his bottles he heated it up in the fire intending to give the sense that burning back to the person that was hex in this young girl legend has it that the bottle exploded in the half of the fire and the following day the which the center of this evil upon this young girl was found dead half burnt by fire but there was no trace on a Caesar fire so people were scribed her death to the actions of the spirit bottle of the witch's bottle which James Morrel had placed earlier in the half of his fire whether this was true or not it certainly aided his reputation and increased the number of people who would come to him on a regular basis seeking help another story was that he killed a witch using the powers of magic white magic against this evil force which allegedly came from the village of kanuda now as you recall in later years George picking Gil allegedly struck a witch down dead could this story be lifted from the reputation of morale and transferred by somebody else to George speaking Gil and I think certainly there are a number of claims ascribed to pagan girl which in fact could be ascribed to James moral in December of 1864 'el became quite seriously ill and foreseen his death which he said will occur on the 16th of December of 1860 and he's fine Wales the village Vicar tried to minister the last rites but when Morel could stand it no longer he fixed his piercing eyes upon him and roared I am the devil master at which point the Vicker gossip terrified and ran for his life he was later given a proper funeral in the churchyard at the church in Hadley unfortunately there is no market to this day as to where he is buried and of course later he was joined by his family who two were also buried in unmarked graves and allegedly on his death certificate of time of death was written his occupation as a quack doctor perhaps rather insulting for the reputation and the enjoyment that his presence gave to the people of Hadley but unfortunately there's always been this psychological battle between the church and people like James Merle and George pecan girl although I hasten to add and I will underscore that James Merle did not worship any horn gods as pick and go did he was a deeply devout Christian this was an extension in his mind of his teachings and understanding of the Bible after his death the landlord of his rented cottage where he lived placed all of his books in the chest and buried it in the garden they were later dug out by his son but Merle and certainly they were believed to have survived until a roughly the year 1956 when they were largely taken out and burnt since his death stories have proliferated about James Merle as indeed with draw picking Gayle as indeed with any of the other more notarized witches that were extant in essex over that period of history and of course it's people like Eric maple and a few others that have stepped into the bridge picking up secondhand stories from other folk which were rightly or wrongly attributed to Eva George picking girl of James Merle I'm inclined to believe that much of the legends associated with James Merle were later adopted by others to include installation of Jaws peaking girl I absolutely no proof to prove or disprove this but it is a theory which I think hold reasonably well in the circumstances one of the most enduring legends that's held to this day about James Merle is a fact that he prophesized that there will be which is in Lee for over 100 years I think that would probably be quite a safe bet particularly today with people's more wider interests in esoteric arts and beliefs and perhaps in me today there are still those witches of old who knows it is a story in the legend of the story which I find fascinating and certainly one could say that with regard to James Merle he was certainly a wired and cunning man and certainly a person whose reputation and good name will probably live on for centuries to come Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. Spooky music. This is the front room of the cottage. just generally where you know where we spend most of our time I'm not sure in relation what this what this room had to be on which is present but it is certainly part of it I don't think the witches were actually kept in here well that's in the next room there but in this room certainly it was 70 parts not prison I'm saying in this room London I'm fitting anything but of course as the night comes in things changed and they and the rooms next door here is it Rwanda fruit so what room are we actually in now this is the room what the ladies I know men that many prisoners were kept in in the holidays especially cage and shove it up to these walls here so they have literally have been hung like this and in those days a very small area you can imagine how that by 10:30 in cramped Scranton all packed in this small space but they were shuttled up to the islands and all the waters the interesting observation here when poverty sometimes become troublesome and indicate it can be a number of factors but the one that striking me very strongly at the moment is all of this is being rebuilt wasn't it what happened was because the building was so so old these bricks and new bricks it was exactly the same dimensions but it's funny I know Levi's they would have a reason money to do but sometimes when you rebuild something if there's a spiritual presence in a property that sometimes I'm happy with what you've done or what was done was this done before you arrived or after before I arrived and out of interest you've lived here in total 150 for three years seven general activity would be the tap some way so only one enough so me up and down the stairs all the time the door latches actually as consequently going you know night yeah you'd see figures all at the time or just bright flashy lights that German sit sit on race swing TVs going on and off things moving about I mean just just constant all the time things would disappear and then turn up in a placement when I swear I put it quite classic from what I understand about these things but all the time very upset constantly and if they frighten you to the degree that you thought it was too many singing for you yeah I mean I basis five three years the first year I was with my family Cole and then John moved in as I have boyfriends and then I was living with Nicole and John and to be honest it was very active there but it's kind of okay when you're living with somebody in the house it it's not as scary then they moved out and I was on my home it didn't take long before I you know because it's kind of when it happens if there's somebody there then not not so much about you wait a bit mmm but you can it's not as scary when on your own I was terrified I succumbed every single night from work straight up the stairs not myself in a bedroom I never came downstairs and so I literally had a cup of tea upstairs and I mean she lived upstairs for every year you clear all things like temperature yes no absolutely my god you could feel straight harsh you sit and then also wow that's freezer and you could actually feel it go past the inside areas and you can see as well dark dark I mean I've seen three ghosts in here which had four as if I can see you know absolutely oh yeah I've seen that too and when you see it you know you're looking at something which is paranormal and one time you're right this ain't real that have a side your brain is saying this cannot be right and you have that kind of confusion in between the middle ground to be honest I was new I saw it because it was always during the day it wasn't sort of an evening class someone with friends or anything I always in you because it wasn't for two seconds I could see them for quiet you know for a good half a minute or maybe longer and your brain has the time amazing this yes I am and then you actually look at the features and then you say that you kind of you know frozen it was always trained the day to be honest what roughly during the day it was a permission time one was 2:00 in the afternoon late afternoon around half past five and the other one was about 1:00 today and you've been pushed more yeah one day I was brushing my teeth bending over the bathroom to get ready for work in the morning by 8 o'clock the one washing my teeth and I got hit so hard and it was like a full brain was smack a really really hard whack and I was completely on my own I've been pushed as well many people in here many people are these have been pushed or slack for have the hair ruffled and things scratched even there's this actual footage of actually you know to scratch this there's roots laying on with this house you see one fitting in this room at the moment it there is a negativity that I can feel it's not overwhelmingly impressive negativity but it's here but what stands more strikingly in the middle of that is a man and a figure now I'm thinking as I'm standing here could this place also be haunted by retain presence of a jailer somebody who has techniques people practice I have had many parallel groups here and it seems like he controls the spirits are here here's something he's a nasty one he's the aggressive one when people do investigations and they shout in when they ask him or they say to him maybe he gets very angry and that's where things fly about he really really does hit he holds it it is like being challenged from what I understand is on tasting a child here the other step back 22 there's lots of children here as well maybe we've caught on using our voices EVP and floats across which is you look fantastic but they're very very simulated way and it's kind of like popping pop out and they're very and when he makes an appearance the, they are scared they sucrry away. I think he def...from what I understand about this type of thing he controls what goes on here, still, even now. 500 years later There is really really heavy atmopshere, here I know. As soon as I stepped on this step. as soon as I got off the starecase I could feel it very very much stronger and I am being drawn into this bedroom. Is this your bedroom or the kids bedroom? This was my old bedroom. You can feel, can't you? It's horrible, That's what I mena you can feel it. It's very bad in here. it makes People feel sick. I am feeling quiet sick. Yeah, exactly that is what happens, yeah. let me just. it's actually brining up wind, it's so powerful yes it is constant, the door is always like. making the cubbard doors fly open. I was here one night can of coke on he bed side table. flew straight on the cup flew. this this is a core this is the core area of the property this is the each house has its core point it's here in this room and I can fill this male presence I know I'm aware I mean the stuff you put here is for the church child spirits but I'm not fitting them at the moment and it could well obviously be his own children he might be a say he might be a killer but this mainline I'm fitting him very very strongly in here and when I walked in here when I got to the landing that almost gnaws his fearless withdraws from the ins my body only pain I haven't felt any female strong female presence is other than downstairs his presence seems to surmount everything it seems to be encapsulate everything that's here I know you're picking up on but there's also another male presence I probably will find ya but how can I say one thing this month I will probably from across there and this another room here is dead we have huge this room is awful. we have massive, huge black energies in here children see what your fireplace I would imagine I don't know maybe the Jamis up here in the old days this was his kind of place the prison was downstairs but this room is hybridizes Victorian yes yeah there would have been some form of Ypres via some kind of a fire downstairs pushing the heat through the building I'm not sure but this room is you know you're talking about children now I can feel very vaguely at this moment I think the two children but I'm not hitting him but I'm feeling this terrible sadness of fear of what is in that room coming into this room the matrons have seems to be there's someone ruling all those presences that terrified the rest and is word oppressive it's very very sad and there was a lots and lots of fear in this house and I know that you know this reason I left left Lots up the house and left left it for years and didn't stay in it anymore there's really lots of things are under this house but that's interested in the there is a connector between the third on what we're going to do tonight just basically sit through positive rooms measuring and evaluating waiting to receive hopefully capturing something interesting to camera I feel confident things are going to change this this room this whole building has a certain own business about it but the interesting thing about it is that it's very distinctive in certain parts of the building it's not like you walk into the house and the whole building feels just the same some rooms as with the sitting room downstairs those are quite pleasant and in that room and this room and to a lesser degree the cage really on the key areas but the the core area of activity the route is in that room okay it's n o'clock now I return back to the haunted house the cage and some O's if and already just wandering around the property the atmosphere is certainly starting to change so very shortly it's lights off and we are going to commence what could be one of the most interesting paranormal investigations that I perhaps ever been able to carry out just do not go up there oh my god it's getting closer that sounds very heavy it's the door the doors opening look jeez oh my god this is incredible this is fantastic thank you can you do something can you come through please it's starting to get a lot more interesting we just heard steps coming footsteps coming up the staircase and onto the landing a very short landing door is opened there's nobody there nothing has come through I thought it might be Vanessa the owner of the property coming back for some reason but she would have shouted out and said something but nothing has been said and instead we've had this incredible event of the door actually opening and actually hearing the footsteps on the staircase it is absolutely fantastic. there is something i can still feel the energy, it's still here, still in this area. let me take a couple of stills nothing oh my god there's a weird light anomaly coming through make sure it's not a reflection I'll take that one and it's still there but it's got smaller there's a strong energy reading and it's gone completely that's the first one to show on camera you can see this you can see that yellow light anomaly as you can see clearly here it it looks like it looks like a hockey stick and it light appears to be coming down with the energy weaker at the top very very odd indeed nothing at all I'm gonna sit here for a while. it feels completly dead in here. yeah nothing at all do you think we should just round up I think we've done enough up here she would just round up with the page we haven't actually done that yeah well no that's a problem we do the cage and then we reconsider where we go from there the only active area and this building so far tonight has been on the staircase and that bedroom but there's been no real activity anywhere else is it but it's just kind of weird to say the least any friendly spirits any persons trapped in spirit here could she make yourself known to us please I picked up a man called Joshua Josh are you here I'm just seeing a light flick across the beams and going to the opening what the beep. what the hell was that oh yeah that was over I can see it here that was over there why is it widget board. what the hell is it doing down... OK. I'm getting the impression whoever whoever is here at this moment wants to make a contact point with us however I'm not prepared to double with Ouija board I think they're very dangerous things to use I think that they can draw through even more trouble activity in an already troubled property and there is absolutely no way I'm going to use a Ouija board and I recommend anyone not to are now saying the experts can use them and I might be an expert but I still don't trust them but this is profound this is an indicator they're twine say something this is a signal let's see where we go from here what is Paul back well it would comfort well I think it was behind that old table in the corner yeah I think well I've read those things though it gets around there wow this is a very interesting property very very interesting there's a lot going on here she's said man you John I think overall tonight it's been good we've been investigating for over three hours and we've certainly got some very good activity to share and that is not including the possibility of course of any electronic voice phenomena and I'm hope I can return there late today
