Utajima is an isolated island with more than 1,400 people surrounded by the sea. From long ago people here lived off the ocean. People used to gather on this small island to shelter from storms. Over the past 20 years, demand for fresh water from the island's only spring has increased. Therefore a roster was created to determine in which order villagers would draw water. Carrying water is women's work, and the island's women all have their own buckets. Early again tomorrow!

It's only natural that an island of fisherman pray to this god. They pray for calm oceans and bountiful fishing. Is anyone here? Ah, Shinji is here. This is for you. ~Father! Shinji brought us a big fish. ~Thank you so much for always bringing us something. I'm so sorry, you're always taking care of us. ~Oh, stay here for a bit. ~Yes, Chiyoko wrote a letter. She's coming back on spring vacation soon and said to pass her regards on to Shinji. Goodbye. Don't bring that up, as soon as you mentioned it, he left. ~It's not so good. ~Talking about Chiyoko? Shinji is really a serious kid. By the way, Mum, do you know of an island woman who's very clumsy at carrying water? I don't know! Who would know from such a description? Hey! When are you going to have the school trip fees? ~I still haven't got it. ~Then when? Shinji's had a long day. If I were still diving for Abalone we'd have more. ~But we have enough to eat. ~That won't pay for the school trip! Quiet down! He'll definitely get the trip fees. Hiroshi, I'll definitely get the money soon, So you can go on your school trip. Shinji, did you know Miyata Teruji's daughter has come back to the island? You didn't know? Sadly his only son Matsu died, so they want to find a son-in-law to take on the family name. His other three daughters are already married. Her family might be the richest family in the village. Hatsue is an accomplished beauty. Shinji, are you tempted? How about a marriage meeting? ~Come on! What do you say? ~Nothing to say. This guy is a little embarrassed. Miyata Teruji is the richest man around, you should try! Miss, leave us to do the work. But I like to keep busy in my free time. Miss Hatsue, look here! So cute! Miss Hatsue, Miss Hatsue, look here, look here! Miss Hatsue, Miss Hatsue! Bastard, what are you doing here? Where did these idiots come from? Hatsue, you have to be careful! Thanks to the gods for granting us smooth fishing, and keeping the village safe. I hope to get married and have children in the future. I pray that the sea, the fish, the boat, and the weather, Are all in harmony, and that everything goes well. Please also keep my gentle mother and young brother safe and sound. Next is my own selfish wish, When will I be able to meet a Beautiful, generous, and charming bride, Like the daughter of Miyata Teruji who just returned to the village. Oh, why are you so late? Nothing special, I went to the shrine Waste of time! That's just wishful thinking. There we go. How about the firewood you gathered? ~Oh, I left it up on the mountain. ~OK I'll fetch it now. You are Hatsue, right? I am Shinji, Kubo Shinji ~Thank you for helping me the other day. ~What? ~When I was carrying water. ~Ah. ~How did you get here? ~I got lost on the way to the Lighthouse Keeper's house. ~Many village girls are going there. ~Oh, the ikebana and homemaking classes, The lady of the Lighthouse used to be a teacher. ~I thought it would be fun to go. ~Good idea, with her and the others. ~What's this building for? ~Target Observation Tower. Over there is the Gulf of Ise. Our ancestors came to this island by boat from there. Were you even listening? Shinji's face looks burned by the sun. Your face is too white! I returned two years ago to help out. If I'm working on the island I'll gradually get darker. If I'm diving, the sea protects me. ~Were you a diver? ~Yes, on Oizaki Island. Is that right? ~People on the island like to gossip, right? ~They sure do. So let's not tell anyone we were here together? Let's make it a secret, only the two of us know. Only the two of us. This path will take you to the Lighthouse. ~So I just keep walking along this path? ~Take care! ~Hello. ~Hello. ~Goodbye. ~Goodbye. Ah I did it! Hey, did I tell you I talked to Miss Hatsue daughter of Miyata Teruji? ~No. ~Naturally only I could do it, ~only I have talked with Hatsue. ~What did you guys say? I said "Hello", and then she said "Hello" to me. I said "Goodbye", and then she said "Goodbye" to me. You just said "Hello"? ~What kind of talk is that? ~You idiot! Right, we're starting late but it can't be helped. ~President, we're late! ~Really late. We’re here to talk about next month. Everybody, as you were. The underground plumbing planning is coming along. We'll soon begin the plumbing construction, According to our budget from the beginning of the year. Oh is that the time? Sorry, no matter what I must attend this next meeting. You guys continue the discussion. ~What's the story with Yasuo? ~You don't know He's going to marry Miyata Teruji's daughter Hatsue. ~This guy is really good looking. ~And fashionable. ~He's the son of a capable family. ~How come I didn’t know this? And you being the guy who said "Hello" and "Goodbye" to Hatsue! That's right! Cheers! Shinji from boat Tairyo Maru Is Shinji here? The result of your hard work, Four thousand yen. Oh, if it isn't Shinji! I heard that Yasuo is going to marry Hatsue. It’s so disappointing, life always brings people pain. What's wrong with you, you look very uncomfortable. I'm fine, don't think about it. Three thousand five hundred yen, three thousand five hundred yen. ~When will we save enough? ~Don’t talk nonsense about it. I still have to study hard. "Murasaki Shikibu was very studious when she was young" "Her elder brother was studying Chinese classical literary novels" "She listened to her brother reading and learned it by heart" "She can be said to be outstanding" Why do you look so down today? "This child was 'Aspiring to Become a Great Scholar'" Hiroshi, come here. I'm studying now. Let's talk about the school trip. Look, I should have 3,500 yen here… ~What's wrong, ~Where's your money? Shinji! ~Hey! Am I going on the trip or not? ~Don’t bother him! Good Evening! You are Teruji's daughter? Is Shinji at home? He only just got back, but he went out again. I found this on the beach. ~Oh? ~With Shinji's name written on it. Hiroshi, you're going on the school trip! Thank you, thank you so much. It's not there, it was over here. Your money fell down here. ~I've already given it to your mother. ~Really?! When I was looking for your house, I asked many people the way. So that no-one would think anything strange, I showed them the envelope with your name. What's wrong with you? I really want to know - Yasuo, Is it true he's your fiancé? What's wrong? ~Yasuo, is it true? ~Idiot, all lies! But I've heard many others say the same thing. There's nothing. Ah, it hurts! I laughed so much it hurts. ~Just a little tightness in the chest, ~Are you okay? Everyone, welcome and thank you for waiting. Now preparing for departure. You must pay attention to safety. ~Ah, aren't you Hiroshi? ~You're Chiyoko from the Lighthouse. ~Are you on a school trip, where are you going? ~Yeah, I'm going to Kyoto and Osaka. ~Amazing! ~It's OK I guess! Oh, how's your brother? ~Hey Hiroshi, what are you doing!? ~Goodbye! ~You are Chiyoko, right? ~Yasuo, right? Spring Vacation is it? Different from the city lifestyle if you haven't been to the island for a while! ~You slowly get used to it. ~That’s right. The island will also have changed since last you were here. Hey, isn't that the Tairyu Maru? Shinji is still on it. Shinji! Oh, Chiyoko from the Lighthouse is calling you! Ah, coming back for the university holiday. Bringing her sophisticated lifestyle with her. ~Anyone home? ~Coming! Welcome. Mum, there's a girl from the village here. ~Oh it’s Hatsue. ~Hello. This is a little souvenir. I'm sorry to always put you to this trouble. A little something from Shishu. I'm back now, so everyone needn't worry about my parents as much. ~Then I'll take my leave ~Stay here for a bit ~Come on, be our guest! ~Right, there's only one of you, it's fine! ~Please come in then. ~Please come in. Then I'll come in. Mum, do you know about Hatsue and her fiancé? ~Is it true? ~No, that's all rumours. ~I didn’t know that. ~Living up here near the Lighthouse, You do get a bit isolated from it all, don't you? ~Welcome ~Hello I'm so sorry to always be accepting your gifts. ~Mother, I'm going up to the Lighthouse. ~For work? Yes, Chiyoko, how about you come with me. The other day some guests gave us some gifts. ~Gifts?! Show me! ~Chiyoko! ~I'd better go back home too then. ~It's fine, sit for a while! By the way, how about dinner for Hatsue? Ah yes, I love to eat, but I can’t cook so well. ~Then maybe you could cook? ~OK There's something you should pay attention to. ~What do you mean? ~Don’t spread rumours. ~You mean about Hatsue’s fiancé? ~You've only just returned, respect other's feelings. Oh that, I heard many people talking about it. ~Don't talk nonsense if you can't confirm it. ~OK I get it! Hatsue has a good memory. After three years, I still can't remember all the lyrics by heart. Well it's almost the same as the song we sing on Oizaki. This looks delicious. ~Hello. ~Hello. ~This is for you. ~Scorpion fish, this is rare, so sorry to trouble you! ~Do you guys know each other? ~Ah, yeah. Oh, small world isn't it? ~Shinji, you're finally here! ~What were the gifts your father showed you? Just some weird pumpkin no one wanted to eat. ~That's just like your father! ~Come with me! I brought a present for you, To thank you for always bringing fish. Hurry up, hurry up. Well then, would you please take care of these as well? This is your present. ~Oh, do you smoke? ~I don't smoke. Then you should have chosen another gift. I put a lot of thought into choosing this lighter! I'll show you. Got it? You try! It's okay, you do it like… pacchin. Look, it's burning! ~What is burning? ~Is it oil? No, I'm talking about this fire. This! What is this? ~It's a flame. ~There's another meaning. This flame represents passion, just like my heart. Chiyoko, what are you saying? ~For you. ~I can't. ~I'm giving it to you, take it. ~No, I don’t want it, I don’t want it. Ah, it hurts. Hey, hey! What happened to you? Are you okay? What's wrong? I stabbed my hand while making fish. ~What are you angry with? ~I'm angry with Chiyoko. ~Silly! ~There's nothing right? ~Right there's nothing! ~Really nothing? Believe me. Then why do you always bring fish to the Lighthouse? ~There's a reason for this. ~What's the reason? ~It’s a long story ~Of course it's because of Chiyoko San! It's not what you think, silly! Then you tell me why. In my last year of high school, I did really badly. The Lighthouse Keeper put in a word for me with the school principal. ~I only just managed to graduate. ~You don't like studying then. ~I'm a bad student. ~Then what are you good at? Nothing much. I can work hard. So there is nothing I'm particularly good at. Nothing to speak of. Amongst the Utajima men, you are amazing, Shinji, you're good enough just like this. Then, when's your next day off? I get the day off whenever there's a storm at sea. Then on the next day off I'll be waiting for you at the Observation Tower. ~OK I'll be there! ~Please do! ~I can't lie about such a thing. ~Maybe there will be a storm tomorrow. Impossible, the sky is full of stars. Come on. You are still young. Hey, you won't get a good rest. ~I'm going out ~During such a big storm, where are you going? ~Not telling. ~Oh, you are blushing! Looks like you're about to eat something very delicious! Have fun with your friend! Don't open your eyes, don't open your eyes. I said don't open your eyes. Why are you backing away? I feel so ashamed. I'll show you my body. So you won't be ashamed. Now there's nothing to be ashamed of. Why? You aren't completely naked yet. Then I'll take everything off. Hatsue. You jump over the fire, jump over! I can't! I can't do this now! ~Why? ~Not now. Wait till I become your bride. Will I be your bride? Are you really willing to be my bride? ~Yes! ~Then I will marry you! So not now. Chiyoko, great day for painting now it's cleared up. Look at the beautiful scenery outside. What a nice view. Let me carry you. ~No? ~It's fine! Like a bride. Miss Chiyoko. ~Are you bored? ~Not especially. The men from this island that stink of fish must be hard to accept for a young girl used to staying in Tokyo. But the fish here is very fresh, don't you think? Oh! The Hinode Maru! That Hinode Maru is a coastal freighter from this area. It makes a lot of money! The owner Miyata Teruji has been looking for a son-in-law to take on the family name, which will be me. But what if you can't marry Miyata Hatsue? ~Oh, that's already been decided! ~Oh really? ~Are you so sure? ~What do you mean? I saw something. ~What did you see? ~Nothing. (Water Roster - Three AM Miyata Teruji) Ah, it hurts. I scared you. Because you were scared, you picked up the stick. Oh, it's Yasuo. ~What are you doing?! ~You better listen to me or I'll tell everyone! ~You and Shinji have been found out! ~There's nothing with Shinji. ~Somebody saw it and told me! ~Fool, let go! Liar! What did you do with Shinji that day? Was it to spite me? Let me go! Do what you did with him! Do it with me! No, no! It hurts. No! It hurts. Oh you climbed up there! Come down, I won't do anything now. What are you doing, that's dangerous! You mustn't tell your father about this! Please, I'm begging you. I got carried away. How can I make it up to you? Carry the water to my house! ~You want me to carry it? ~Yes! Hiroshi, that's enough. You haven't told me anything about the school trip yet. ~How was the Nara Daibutsu Buddha? ~So big! ~Did you go to Kyomizu in Kyoto? ~Mmmm. ~How was that? ~So many shrine gates! Wow, you've been to all of these locations! ~I'm off to play ~Hiroshi ~Oh! What's on your face?! ~This is what an Indian looks like. ~An Indian? ~We saw it in a movie theater in Kyoto. One trip away and this kid completely changes his personality! Chief! What caused these big waves? It's because the God is angry! How can we satisfy the God? You have to offer your tribute first. Of course we dare not anger the God. Chief, why is the God still angry? ~Because of an immorality! Because of a sin! ~Then tell us what it was! It's because of your Shinji and that Hatsue! That's what made the God angry! What are you saying about them? That's not why the God is angry! Really? It's because that man and woman slept together! You stupid bastard! ~This bastard! ~Get him! About you and Hatsue, Do you know that everyone is talking about you behind your back? ~Did you sleep with her? ~No! ~So everyone in the village is wrong? ~Yes! ~Is that true? ~It's true! Ah, if so then nothing more need be said. So much gossip going around. Have you heard about Miyata Teruji's family? He needs to pay attention to his daughter! Yeah, I heard she did it with with Kubo Shinji. I heard they did it at the Observation Tower! Hatsue! ~Hatsue! ~Yes. You're confined to the house from now on! Got it? Hey, Hatsue isn't stepping outside again… Watch her closely! Uncle! Help me forward this. Forbidden to meet, reduced to love letters! This was pressed into my hand this morning! Very excited to get a love letter at my age! But then I saw it had Shinji's name on it. I was so disappointed, I was gonna throw it into the sea. Let's have a look! My father was very angry when he heard the rumours about us. He said I'd never be allowed to meet Shinji in the future. Whatever I say my father doesn't believe it. All I can do is write a letter to you every day, and hide it under the stone behind the house. Shinji, if you take it yourself, I'm afraid it will be dangerous. Please ask a friend you can trust to help you, Hatsue. Ah, I see! Okay, from tomorrow you can be the trusted friend! He's so late, maybe he couldn't find it. Oh look! Your postman is here! I risked my life. Maybe I could be a successful thief? Idiot, you should have got here earlier. Okay, let's sail. Shinji, no matter what lies people say, We must strengthen our hearts. I pray every day that Shinji will be safe and healthy. Shinji. Shinji. Shinji, wait, My husband has something to tell you. It’s really weird. It’s not like Shinji to just leave the fish and run. His ears are full of rumours and he must be in pain inside Then he should tell us. ~He's not that kind of man. ~I suppose you're right. No matter how much pain he was in, he didn't forget about us. Such courage is commendable. Shinji has been hurt by the rumours, must be nearly more than he can bear. But… How did the rumours start? Must be such a gossip. Isn't this more and more of a scandal? This gossip is a disgrace to the island! Isn't this more and more of a scandal? This gossip is a disgrace to the island! Chiyoko felt that she had betrayed the island. Chiyoko will probably never visit Utajima again. There are too many painful reminders on the island. Tomorrow my father will meet some very important guests. He'll retire very early after drinking with the guests. Let's meet at Yatsushiro Shrine tomorrow evening ten o'clock. Hatsue! You come with me! Quickly! Sneaking around like a thief. Stop thinking about him, it’s impossible between you. Hey! Come over and tend the fire. This matter is closed. Got it? Ok thank you. If it isn't the Captain of the Hinode Maru! What brings you to the island? Some small matter with Teruji. Working hard again? Speaking of hard work, how about you do some? So charming, you must have many girls. Are you recruiting female "trainees"? Like that one in Nagasaki? This tobacconist's daughter is still joking at such an old age. Don't over exert yourself! See you! For the Monk at the Buddhist Shrine, I only have this humble food. Why are you giving them our gyoza? Of course we have to give them something! I'll go. Be careful! Hey, cheer up! Mum, what do you think I should do? There's nothing you can do! ~Why? ~Yesterday, I noticed you are still in touch with each other? I saw the letter you were holding. You still like Hatsue, right? ~No matter what, I can’t change my feelings. ~Just let it go. It’s no big deal letting go, didn't you know? This is what it's like for poor people. But maybe you can't let it go? Good evening. Oh, it's your boss. ~I brought a guest! ~Good evening! ~Oh, it's the Captain of the Hinode Maru! Shinji stand up! ~No need! No need! I came to ask Shinji to take part in maritime training on the Hinode Maru. Although the maritime training is very difficult, it really develops young men. Then, Captain, this idea was yours alone? ~No, Miyata Teruji also suggested it. ~How's that possible? Shinji, what do you think? ~How about it? ~You mustn't go! Don't fall for their trick! Hinode Maru is Teruji's ship, that man only means to harm you, got it? If you care about Hatsue, then for the sake of Hatsue you mustn't go! What are you talking about, be serious! ~Yasuo will be training with him! ~How can that be? Shinji, this is a chance for a man to display his courage. ~Think about it carefully ~Don't be tricked into going! ~I'll do it! ~You can’t! Even if Yasuo is going, there's some trick! For the sake of Hatsue, you can’t join the Hinode Maru training. Don't you get it?! ~I've already decided! ~You've decided despite your mother's refusal?! They're making fools out of poor people like us. You agree to Teruji's tricks! But you don't listen to your mother? ~Tomi San, don't be so stubborn! ~Leave me alone! So stubborn and hot tempered! Shinji, what do you say? I'll do it! ~Good! ~As expected of Tomi's son! Come, let's drink! I've come to meet Teruji I'm Kubo Tomi Auntie Good evening. ~Oh thanks for your help the other day. ~No need. ~What do you want with my father? ~Ah… Oh, the master is a bit busy right now ~He doesn't want to see me?! ~Yes! You think our family is too poor, right? You rich people always think you're so virtuous! Teruji! Listen carefully! My Shinji truly loves your daughter! You're not so amazing just because you're rich! Your girl is very cute, but my boy isn't below her! He won't lose to anyone! If Shinji doesn't come back I couldn't bear it! Even your precious daughter agrees with me! ~No one here stands up to you! ~Aunty. I have nothing to say to you. With your expectations, and those of the family upon me, I will strive to do my utmost. Thank you for taking time out of your busy lives to be here today! That guy waffles on, doesn't he?! Shinji, Hatsue is here too, hiding behind the boat. Don't worry about me, I will come back safely. Look after Mum. Listen to her. ~The boat is about to set off. ~OK Shinji. Be careful out there. Come back safely, good luck. We are departing now, goodbye folks. Return safely. Excuse me Uncle. Please give this to Shinji. Shinji, you forgot something. See you again! Good luck! Come on! Another bucket. Feeling nervous? Don’t you know that smoking is banned? Read the sign, fool! After we go back, I'll be Teruji's son-in-law. This boat will be mine too. ~Hatsue, come over here in the sun! ~Thank you. ~Hey! Look after her. ~She should look after herself. It seems that the rumours are true. ~Hatsue and Shinji? ~They did it for sure! Is that right, everyone knows they did it? OK everyone! Let's compare breast size! ~Prepare to get them out! ~OK this time I'll show you all. ~What do you think? ~What are your hands doing there? That's cheating! Let everyone see yours then! Mine were so proud and upright a long time ago! Mine would definitely not lose to yours! Come and have a look! ~Take a look at mine! Look! ~Hatsue, you also show everyone! ~Um I dont really… ~Come on! Everyone take note! These are the breasts of a girl who has never experienced a man. Now that everyone understands, stop talking nonsense! ~Hello everyone! ~Hello! I didn't scare anyone? Instead of a breast competition, how about an Abalone competion! No interest? Come see the amazing goods I have here! You're always diving, now inspect these! I'm so heavily laden today, I'll offer one of these as a prize! First prize is the latest vinyl handbag. These vinyl products are very popular in the big cities. White if it's a young lady. ~Brown for middle aged, Black for old people. ~I'd better have white then! Come on everyone! On this day! We've unexpectedly had an Abalone diving competition, which reminds me of many years when I was a school principal, Watching the annual athletics day, first place going to the most skilful, We are now waiting for the result… That's about enough from you, hurry up! Who got first place? Ok then I'll continue, First place with 16 Abalone is awarded to Miyata Hatsue San. The second place with 14 Abalone is awarded to Tomi San. ~What kind of prize do I need at my age? ~Hatsue come and receive your prize Painful losing to that young lady, as if she hasn't got enough already! This is for you, congratulations! Hatsue, that's the middle aged one! Why not the white one? Aunt. Why me? Because my father is always rude to you, I want to apologise. I always wanted to apologise to you. This would be the first time. ~Eh, what a warm hearted daughter! ~Tomi, aren't you going to take it? Fool! What a fool! Aunt, please accept it. Thank you. I want Shinji to know that you are so good to me. What a big wave, are you OK? Hurry up and tighten this rope. Come on, the water's coming over! ~How is the Hinode Maru? ~Anchoring outside Port Okinawa. ~They're still OK. ~They'll ride out the storm there. Okay, the storm is getting worse again. Why is this wind so strong? Hurry up, come on! No! It's broken! Captain! Captain! Broken! ~What's broken? ~The rope. The rope is broken? We must fix it! Can anyone swim out to the buoy to attach the line? Can anyone do it? No volunteers? Then I'll do it! Captain! I'll go! You must swim out and fix the rope to the buoy, got it? Go! Are you OK Shinji?! Shinji, do your best! The rope started to move. Shinji, are you OK?! Hurry up and secure the rope. Summer is here, Shinji and Yasuo have returned to this peaceful island. Shinji is still fishing on the Tairyu Maru as before. ~I heard you did something great, Shinji! ~It was nothing. You'll be able to succeed this time! ~Did you hear anything from Teruji? ~No. ~Hello. ~Thanks for your work. I'm home. What is it? Chiyoko, she… Do you remember the day of the big storm in April? On that day I saw Shinji and Hatsue together at the Observation Tower. I told Yasuo about this. I feel I have committed a great sin. Without realising, in my heart, I always think of the wrong things I have done. I feel more and more sad, it's very painful. How long will I endure this way? As your daughter I feel so embarrassed. How could I do such a dirty thing? I hope to be able to reform. But I can’t change what I did. Life can only drag on like this. Please, Father and Mother, I hope you can help Shinji and Hatsue get married. I pray for them to be happy. Otherwise I can never return to the island. Please, I hope I can use everyone's strength to help. Let's go to Miyata Teruji to speak in support of Shinji and Hatsue. Okay, what are you all waiting for, let's go! Hurry up, let's go! Thank you all! Though we've arrived unannounced, we have something very important to tell you. What do you want to say? So many distinguished women together! Then… I’m going to talk about the matter of Hatsue in your household and the Kubo family's Shinji. ~Hatsue and Shinji? ~Yes. ~This matter has already been concluded. ~What kind of conclusion is this?! ~What did you say?! ~Shinji has tremendous courage! ~How can that Yasuo win…?! ~Fool! Hatsue's fiancé has been determined to be Shinji. I heard all about Shinji and Yasuo's performance on the Hinode Maru. And from that, Shinji won. A man must have spirit, if he's got spirit that's what counts! That's the kind of man this island needs. Family and fortune are secondary. ~Don't you agree? Ladies? ~Yes! Thank you very much for allowing us to fulfill our wish. Although I can't do too much right now. We must work hard together and take care of both parents. Ah, Shinji, I rushed here as soon as I heard. ~What are you guys praying for now eh eh? ~Why are you talking nonsense? Be more respectful! What are you waiting for, go drive your boat! Wait! Take your fiancé along! Alright. Finally a smile appeared on the young lady's face. She thought her photo had protected him no matter what storms or waves he had encountered. But this was just youthful naivety. He knew that his own strength had brought him through that difficult night. (End)
