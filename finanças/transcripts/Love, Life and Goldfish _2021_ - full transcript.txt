Hey, buddy! Where are you going? Come on, hop in. No, thanks. I'll walk. It'll take you 2 hours! Don't be shy. I'll call a taxi. Do you think it'll come, out here? What are you doing here, buddy? Nothing. Enjoy your stay, buddy. As a rule, I don't trust people who call me "buddy". He looks suspicious. A truckload of goldfish. I ended up in a country town full of mystery. No department stores, no multiplex. Chemical-smelling lime fragrance. My future totally redrawn by a single mistake. From the heart of Japan to the middle of nowhere. Yeah, I am... a demoted bank clerk. Just like falling from past glory Swept away shaking in a strange town Even the birds Are laughing at me I can hear them singing "Welcome back home" In the warm wind The sky is blue and clear I want to go back to Tokyo A town I can call home Nothing but an unfamiliar view To an exciting place Go left here. I'm going straight. Thanks. "Kotoya" This way, buddy. Buddy. Take your time and enjoy yourself. Enjoy myself? A seductive fragrance. Obscene lamps. This is definitely... Er, no. I just wandered in by mistake. Don't be so nervous. Let's play together. Wha-? Play?! She whispered those lewd words with such an innocent face. My mind's shouting "Don't!" But my body feels like a puppet. I lost control. In Fairyland I'd be a troll. Is this your first time? Er, no... Here. Huh? What? Let's start. Time limit's 3 minutes. Ready, go! Where am I? Who am I? I'm in the sticks. I'm an ex-excellent banker. Goldfish. Just goldfish. What am I doing? The only thing I can say is... I didn't come here for this. Really? What did you come here for? Well... I wanted to play together... To cross the line... Hey, buddy. I knew it! She must be the lady who lures the customers in! This is a place of sin and free love... I see. You're the new tenant. The apartment block's over there. We're neighbors now. This is the company dorm? Make yourself at home. The smell of rush, the battle's over. Dropped out from the race, deprived of a pleasant company. From a luxury condo in Aoyama to a room in the sticks. I could never imagine such a hopeless day would come. Now I'll gently confine Loneliness into my heart If just one mistake Can change your fate I don't need anything I won't ask anymore I'll just sleep quietly alone The guy from the head office starts today, right? I've heard he's really smart. He may be from Tokyo, but he's still a rookie here. We must show him who's boss. Stop! Diana'll get fat again. You gotta eat more, Elizabeth. I wonder if he's handsome. He may ask us out. That would be great! This is Kashiba. He'll work with us from today. Inhabitants of a smoky world. A line of faces, all look the same. I'm Makoto Kashiba, from Tokyo head office. He's handsome. Not quite. Looks full of curiosity, jealousy, envy, feasting on me. Acting tactfully and flawlessly is my forte. I'll hide my real thoughts. Capitalizing on my experience at the head office, I intend to carry out my duties quietly with the motto "Numbers never lie". I'm looking forward to work together. He's emotionless. Your desk's over there. Fist off, can you input this data? Yes, Sir. This is reality. I understand. This is my current position. I can only trust the numbers. Let's go! Where? To visit our customers. We gotta get at least one new contract today. It's not necessary. The customers are already here. A total of 12 changes in contract details and new contracts. I'm impressed, Kashiba. Numbers never lie. Let's go visit the customers. The decor's all over the place as usual. You shouldn't talk. Don't slack off, Big Bro. Come help me. OK. The usual countryside pub run by siblings. Lazy service. Look at those killer legs. Who's this boring guy in a suit? He's my junior. Don't look at me with those leering eyes. I feel sorry for him, sent out here in the sticks. He's an envoy from the head office. Really? He's an elite banker! Here you go. Asuka's Special Napolitan pasta. Thank you. So? What do you think? It's a Napolitan. That's it? She's starving for a compliment I feel pity. What she wants to hear is... It's delicious. Right? Makes you wanna eat it everyday. In truth, it's just above average. And super easy to make. I'd cook it for you everyday. Stop chatting him up. You can't date a Tokyo guy. He's out of your league. Excuse me, may I ask you... Wanna know about me? Asuka Yamazoe, 27 years old. Pisces. Blood type O. Not that. Size of the store, rent, live music fee, price and cost of all dishes. Could you also give me the data for equipment expenses? Sorry to be rude, but I can't say it looks like a successful business. I'll propose an improvement plan. My junior's a hard worker. It was negligence on our side to leave you in this situation. I'm really sorry. He looks much more reliable than you. What did you say? By the way, since you're new... you guys will do that, right? Of course. We made a reservation at Kotoya. Excuse me, do what? Kashiba, it's a 3-minute challenge. Goldfish scooping is a full-fledged sport. Time's over! Oh? Kashiba. You haven't caught even one? No. You're really an amateur. I'll teach you. Listen. First, your right hand... Getting excited for a childish game. A futile feast of commoners. Yes. Thank you. Don't make that face. It's your welcome party. I'm sorry. Don't need a welcome. Didn't ask for it. Any way you slice it... It's a waste of time. Kashiba? I'm a bit tired. I'll excuse myself. Please feel free to continue. Kashiba. Fish stock. Sorry to bother you. The door was unlocked. I brought you some food. I'm glad you like ohagi rice cake. Not quite... Here's some tea. It's excellent. She could start a shop. Ideally around Kiyosumi Shirakawa. It's an area full of cafes, popular with young people nowadays. Daily production number... You're an interesting guy. No, I'm a boring bank clerk. I can't even scoop goldfish. The people from this town go back being kids in front of goldfish. They all look so happy. I inherited my shop, Kotoya, from my father. I've got to go now. But, we haven't yet... Come whenever you like, Mr. Kashiba. I'll be your playmate. My playmate? You can't get better scooping dried sardines. Goodnight. Goodnight. Wake up, Kashiba. That's dirty, clean it up. If you came to help, work. I'm sorry. Why do I have to...? It's part of the job. Did I say it out loud? It was all over your face. What's this? The improvement plan for your pub. I summarized the prospective yield. First of all, the interior design concept feels rather confusing. In short, inconsistent with zero taste. It's the mixed style that's in fashion now. The ticket price for live music seems too low. And the cost is too high for your budget price lunch. The townspeople love our pub. When you hear that cliché, put reason first. At this rate, this pub probably won't last 3 years. Right. I'll start preparing the curry. You should face reality. Reality, reality. You can dream as much as you like, but reality will hit you in the face. Only people like you can get by in Tokyo, I guess. I went there too. About 7 years ago. I wanted to become an actress. I ran away from home. I kept on longing For that lowering sky I looked up without an umbrella The city was so big Every time I felt sad I sprayed a smile on my face Longing for tomorrow Wearing away The soles of my shoes I pretended to expect nothing But I did have expectations Goodbye Ephemeral dream of my youth Seasons go by Without turning back Those days ran past They were brilliant The worries, the doubts An irreplaceable Treasure, but Seasons go by I want to forget my dreams But deep in my heart Almost cruelly I wonder why They keep shining The sky I look up to Is already far away Just kidding. Are you crying? You... are letting your feelings out... with no sign of embarrassment, sublimating them in a beautiful song. Even if... it may not be socially acceptable, it still is a wonderful thing. That doesn't sound like a compliment at all. I... kept holding my feelings inside without being able to express them. Because of that, I made a huge mistake. I was working on a loan for an AI-based robot massage parlor at the time. 500 million yen to finance the startup. But, my boss said... Sounds like a bunch of massage chairs. Massage has sense... only when done by human hands. So you can feel their warmth. That's so last century. He didn't listen to my "human skin system" explanation. And didn't even look at the data. Healing comes from human contact. Massage conveys the warmth and kindness of a human heart through the hands. It's the same for our job. It's all about human connection. Contact? Warmth? The hell with the old approach. Reliable data is king. Money over sympathy. I'll show you the new method. You've got horrible taste. Nicotine teeth... spitting nonsense. Take the train and go home. You're too fat, lose weight. Shut up, old man! Cut it out! What?! Er, no... I didn't mean it. It's not like that. Wait! I'm sorry! I'm really sorry. You messed up big time. I couldn't believe it. I didn't even know what I've said. You held everything inside for too long so you finally burst out. That's why you're here? I couldn't survive at the head office after pissing him off. I'm like you. I was kicked out of Tokyo. So, since we're both rejects... let's be good friends. Working like you should, rookie? I really hate your lack of tact. That was a close shave. Well, it's not like I was in danger. Or maybe we can say I was. Or maybe... Mr. Kashiba. What are you doing here? Er... Well... Um... I came to ask you to train me. Really? Yes. So you finally fell in love? What? Oh, not yet? I left such feelings in Tokyo. But, don't you find 'em lovely? Lovely? So small and red. What? The fish used for goldfish scooping are all small and bright red. They're Japanese goldfish that can't be sold. They failed the selection. You're rejects too? You should have been praised and valued for your beauty, but you got kicked out of the elite because of a tiny mistake. Ruined and lost... You can't go back. Lovely. You're right. You think? Um, er... I'm glad... that you've shown interest in goldfish scooping. Here's the scoop. Thanks. First, look closely and pick the one you want. The one I want... Thanks. Let's see... This one is really slow. I should be able to... Urk... Then... This one looks weak. I'll pick this. You mustn't chase it. Just wait. Wait... Yes. You wait for it to come over the scoop. Wait. Wait. Wait... Wait. It did! Scoop! Congratulations. It's just one catch. The first catch makes you feel really happy, doesn't it? It was uplifting to some extent. Oh, sorry. Thank you. Er... may I have the goldfish? The one I've just caught. Yes, but... it got mixed with the others. W-wait! May I borrow this? It's this one. I'm positive. This is the one. I don't know why, but I don't feel like going home. On a day like this, I feel the need to go drinking with someone. On a night like this, a guy who can't drink has no other choice but to make do with something sweet. What did I do when I was in Tokyo? Damn. I wanted to get sentimental all by myself. Oh? The goldfish guy! We've met before. Right? Who knows. You like goldfish scooping. Not particularly. I can't see the fun in pursuing fish. It's the feeling that it's beyond your control. Life is full of things beyond your control. I don't feel the need to go through even more trouble. It's huge. That's the same type of Japanese goldfish as yours. Really? The first one I've ever scooped. Her name is Sakura. She's 27 years old. Do they live that long? If given tender love and care, even the small ones will grow up. Also, the fishbowl is important. Right... If you keep them in a small bowl, they won't get bigger. If you keep it in a big fishbowl, it'll grow fast and big like her. I've got the perfect one for you. I'll give you a good price. There's chlorine in tap water. Make sure you purify it. Add vitamin C. And... You're the guy I gave a lift the other day! Jeez! Why didn't you tell me? I don't like him. This is for you, buddy. Be my guest. I can't drink alcohol. I thought so. It's alcohol-free. I'm driving. I don't like him. Cheers. You can't make any money selling goldfish nowadays, can you? No. A loser's carefree smile. I'm surprised you know about this place. You're like a local. Not particularly. Even this jerk's singing is taking my breath away. I've gotta go now. Grow that little one into a big beautiful fish. It's up to you. It looks cool, right? Yes. It's less shady now. Is that a compliment? Of course. Where's the owner today? My brother? Just roaming around, I guess. I see. I shall excuse myself now. It's a bit early, but... why don't you have lunch? Er, no... Come on. Take a seat. OK. "Performers Wanted" Can you sing? No, it's not for me. Do you take also piano players? Not her. Yoshino, right? She doesn't play in front of people. Why? She's so good. It's a shame. How do you know she can play? I saw her in the storehouse. So you fell in love. Me? I have feelings for her? What are you talking about? She looks pretty, brave and wistful, and you fell for her. No way. You should give up on her. As I said, er... I'm not particularly... As I keep repeating, I don't care about love. I shouldn't, but... what's up with me? In my heart... Shaking feelings Restless eyes My heart flutters Shaken by a feeling I can't name You pretend not to notice She puts up a brave face I wonder why She's waiting in vain again today Always lonely somewhere She's thinking about him I'm not going to fall any lower The only thing I'm in love with is work I've decided to live my life alone Hey, I'll always be by your side Getting closer, hesitating Little by little Let's melt together Dream or reality An ephemeral illusion I want to forget but I can't Hey, listen to me Here in front of you I dedicate to you My love song What's wrong? What is he, a girl? Hey rookie, working hard? Yes, I am. What's up with him? What? What? What? What was that? What's going on? Let's get to work. For you, Kashiba. Ranchu's concert tickets. Huh? I can't... It's your client, right? I'll give you two. No, no, er... If I go back there, she'll approach me again. The pub's name... sounds like "raunchy"! Hey. What's up with him? Who knows. I can't stop thinking about the black-haired vision who's taken over my heart. I like to chase better than being chased? You mustn't chase it. Just wait. What did I come to this town for? Don't tell me... He's got a life? I'm leaving early today. "We'll take a break of 1 minute and 20 seconds" "In the meantime, please listen to this song" A guy from the business elite has come from the head office His looks ain't bad And he's an ace at work I won't be beaten by a Tokyo guy See you tomorrow. I'm nice and tough More than anyone I'll keep going In spite of her rejections I lack of tact And my contact lenses hurt But I love this town My life is here All right. "Enjoy the second half of the movie" I can't concentrate on work at all. Yoshino! Faintly reflected Dancing cheerfully Secretly fragrant Shining fleetingly Reaching the fingertips Her neck turning red Wavering steps Singing lips Faintly reflected Dancing cheerfully Secretly fragrant Shining fleetingly You already know Why your heart is aching In the instant we touch each other Your heart starts pounding I still don't know Where this pain in my chest lies If I look in your eyes I hear a melody If we put our hands together And follow our hearts We'll melt together and flow away Far away Endlessly Why...? What do you want? Did you know? According to a 2013 Keio University experiment, goldfish have the ability to distinguish sounds. They use a system of organs called lateral line to detect vibration... Another experiment proved that radish sprouts grow better listening to Mozart. It's fairly possible that it'd work with fish too. So...? So, could you please play for my fish? The piano, I mean. I can't. Why? My childhood friend was a piano prodigy. When I was 10, we both performed in a concert. But, when I got onto the stage, I couldn't play. I didn't want to be compared with my friend. I was afraid I'd come to hate the piano if I lost face performing together. I couldn't move my fingers. How silly of me. I stopped playing in front of others since then. It's a shame. I'm perfectly happy playing here. I love the piano. Really? Yes. If you love the piano... Er... Are you free tomorrow night? There's a concert at Ranchu. My colleague gave me tickets. Maybe it doesn't sound like a good idea after what you've just said, but... I was there earlier, and the band wasn't very good. Maybe it'll make you feel like playing there. For future reference. Shall we meet there at 7? Yes! Your ticket. As for your goldfish, please leave it there. "Summer Festival" Here you are! Kashiba! Can you go visit Yokoyama Store, Arai Trading Company and Takamura Fish Farm? 3 places? Now? They said they'll only sign contracts with you. Yes, Sir. I'll borrow this, then. Good luck. Thank you! Thank you I'll excuse myself. When did you get back in town, Big Brother? You're so mean. Sorry. Didn't I tell you? Are you staying here for a while? Who knows. But, I'm happy to see you're doing fine. Did you grow a bit taller again? No. I'm not a child anymore. Really? How have you been? Good as usual. Just going where the wind takes me and my goldfish. Going our way, I guess. Your performance was amazing, as one would expect. I wonder when I'll be able to listen to your piano again. Whenever you want, Yoshino. You say that now, but then you'll just disappear like you did last time. Stop that annoying childhood friends talk. Makes me cringe! If you love each other, just kiss! What are you talking about? If you keep wandering around, someone'll take Yoshino away. What? A great guy's after her now. You've drank too much, Asuka. Big Brother, can you pass me that water? Don't want it. Stop calling him like that. You ain't even related! Big Bro! Gimme water! Are you OK? You've grown up, Yoshino. Idiot. I'm sorry. It's OK. About yesterday... Don't worry, it's OK. See you. There's no doubt... that, since I saw you in a dream... you've stolen my heart, to a certain extent. But that was most likely just a mere fancy. Falling in love with someone you saw in a dream. There's nothing to it. Happens all the time. Was it a dream? Doesn't matter. In cases like this, just put yourself into your work. Yeah. To hell with love, affection and goldfish. The only thing that supports me is work. Makes my life worthwhile. I know. Deep inside I'm lonely. I feel sad and miserable. So I must work. Throw yourself into work. Forget everything. I feel like going drinking. But, not alone. I don't want to ask her. But, I do want to go... Now, that's unusual. You wanna go drinking. I never said that. You just did. Cheers! You can't drink? Pops like soda. Feels cool down the esophagus. Bitter, fragrant aftertaste. Lacks the original punch, but the taste's extremely similar. Alcohol-free beer, gentle on non-drinkers. Bon appetit. The onion feels nicely crunchy on your tongue. The noodles are soft and chewy. Lightly flavored with ketchup, a taste loved by everyone. What? In central Tokyo you'd pay 1,200 yen for a pasta like this with coffee. Considering the different cost of life, it should be 750 yen here. No... How about 820 yen, served with a side of salad? Excuse me? Kashiba's always mumbling lately. I can often hear him at work. Don't tell me... I'm letting my thoughts leak out? Did I bare my heart and all the bad thoughts I had? Did I blow it again? They're gonna send me even farther away? No, there's no place more remote than this. Then... Kashiba, we've got to talk. The branch manager! I've got a call from HR. It's here, then. The demise of my banker life. Finally, the end... It's a shame for us, and we'll miss you. The head office appreciated your efforts. From next month... Don't tell me... Oh my god! I can go back to Tokyo? I'll say goodbye to the sticks? My days crammed in a tatami room, covered in goldfish, are over? Look. This is the face of the bank clerk that has made a miracle! I'm really glad you're so happy. I'd have never thought you'd open your heart to us like that. Kashiba? Kashiba? Kashiba. What happened? Yoshino. I have something important to tell you. When I asked you to play for my fish, that was just an excuse. In truth, I really want to hear you play. So... could you please play the piano for me? Mr. Kashiba... You won't? No. I have no choice, then. I'll sing. I will sing over the melody of my current feelings. "Only You, Only Me Words/ Music: Makoto Kashiba" I'm not myself anymore That's all Your fault That's too sudden. I can't. Don't say that. Come on, it's your turn to sing. The melody has already started. You, with your sad smile In this boring little town I'll be your vitamin C If you want Don't suffer Vitamin C? Why? Vitamin C can free the water from chlorine. If your goldfish struggles to live in tap water, you can boil the water, keep it overnight, or... add vitamin C as a first aid. I want to protect you I want to save you Only you I'll hold you tight In my arms Even if you feel you're breaking down Don't leave my side I want to protect you No good! Yoshino. I'll go back to Tokyo next month. Come with me. Mr. Kashiba... I can't do that. You should have smiled and said yes. What are you talking about? It looked like that kind of mood. I have to run Kotoya. Just foist it on someone else. Don't be selfish. I like it here. I love this town. Then... At least play the piano in front of everybody. Why are you so obsessed with that? When you play the piano, you have the same expression as your customers scooping goldfish. You look "so happy". I want to see that expression on your face. I'd keep worrying about you if I went back to Tokyo like this. Perform at the Summer Festival next week, please. Otherwise, I'll abduct you and take you to Tokyo with me. You're talking crazy. I want to save you. I'm doing just fine the way I am. OK, I got it. It went as planned. Being an elite banker, I never neglect risk management. If I'll win at goldfish scooping against that guy at the festival, please perform there. "That guy"? Yes, "that guy". Can I ask you something? How many goldfish can you scoop in 3 minutes? Let me think... I've lost my touch lately. In your heyday? 100. Really? More or less. Excuse me? I'll scoop 101 goldfish at the Summer Festival! After I scoop 101 goldfish and win against him at the festival, you'll play the piano there. It's a deal. OK? Come on... 101 in 3 minutes makes it one fish every 1.8 seconds. It's not impossible. I can do it. That's completely impossible. Besides... Big Brother won't accept such a challenge. I want you to accept my challenge. Nope. Normally one should accept in this situation! I don't like fighting. I just want to enjoy myself. Sometimes life is about winning or losing! Sometimes you have to face reality even if it's painful! A guy singing alone like this on a hilltop must have... something on his mind! Don't try to hide behind that smile! I'm not. Just once. 3 minutes of your time. That's all I ask. Now I'll gently confine Loneliness into my heart If just one whisper Can change your fate I don't need anything I won't ask anymore I'll just sleep quietly alone Why are you wearing a suit, Kashiba? He's not going there to have fun but to fight, apparently. You're in a good mood. Are you sure you can scoop 100 fish? As opposed to you, he's very talented. He can do anything. Not 100, but 101. Same difference. It's not the same. Numbers never lie. Temperature 31℃. Humidity 67%. Atmospheric pressure 1007.28hPa. Good. I'll go with plan G12. How many does he have? Is that guy gonna show up? Who knows. He's the phantom uncrowned champion, after all. He's here! The festival's in full swing, huh? It's so much fun. Fun? Don't kid me. This is a serious challenge! Let's have 3 minutes of fun, Kashiba. Come on, Kashiba! Don't get nervous! Amazing! So beautiful. What are you doing? Kashiba! You gotta speed up. I was doing much better during practice. I didn't take tension under account. I can't believe I made such a mistake. I can't lose! I'd be a laughing stock all my life. I have to make my Tokyo comeback in style at any cost! It's checkmate... The battle is over. Why can he still scoop? How? Even though the scoop's broken... Why is he having so much fun? A loser's... carefree smile. Where are you going, Kashiba? You can't waste time! You have 100 goldfish to go. 100? You can't save anyone if you obsess over numbers. You've always said the opposite! Buddy. Come here. Now I'm not afraid to sing with all my heart I'm not afraid I'm not lying If I sing now With all my heart This moonlit night Will see the dawn I just pretend not to look Always take the long way around A tear Hidden in my chest But now my heart is pounding I can't stop I'm just so happy In the shining, falling wind If we're destined To get lost in each other's eyes My heart shakes Shouts and sprouts Bares itself And starts to dance If you swim well in this world Scooping is just a dream? If you swim well in this world Scooping is just an illusion? We've almost reached the end The end credits will start soon Please stay with me Just a little longer Try scooping too "Love, Life and Goldfish" Now I'm not afraid to sing with all my heart I'm not afraid I'm not lying If I sing now With all my heart This moonlit night Will see the dawn Dance all by yourself Talk softly about love Sing more to the sky Scoop everything up Matsuya Onoe Kanako Momota Hayato Kakizawa Nicole Ishida Based on the manga "sukuttegoran" by Noriko Otani originally serialized in the monthly magazine BE LOVE by KODANSHA Ltd.
