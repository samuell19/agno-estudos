Hey! John. The town of Westberg had 5,000 people. 3,000 die from the virus. 1,500 of the infected was taken care of. So you do the math, yeah? That's 500 missing. 500 potential contagious bearers. The town was clean. I don't care about your opinion but I do care about facts and I'm gonna give you the chance to share some with me. Tell me where the townfolks went. John? I'm gonna count to 10. One. I don't know where they are. Two. Three. Four. Let her go. Let her go. Five. Six. I don't know. I don't know! They all left by the time my squad got there. Seven. She's got nothing to do with this. You're really gonna sacrifice your wife for a bunch of strangers? Eight. Nine. Kill me instead. I beg you. Kill you? Please stop this. The time for heroes is over, John. Remember. Look at me. Look at me! I love you, I love you! You chose this. You chose this! I don't know where they are! No! Get down. Stop! Leave them alone! Stop! They're innocent. Traitor! Remember. Please stop this. You're really gonna sacrifice your wife? Let her go. You chose this. Your wife was infected, John. She had to die. And you know the rule we cannot let one person be responsible for a million dead people. She was not infected. She wasn't? You could've tested her. Oh, we did, John. We did. But I always found those things highly unreliable. I'd rather trust my gut, or as they say stay on the safe side. How many innocents are you gonna kill for the common good? Innocent? Don't change the subject. Are you at least not a bit interested in what's in store for you? No. No? You're immune, John, and we want to find out how. So maybe you'll get the chance to save some more lives after all. Cheer up, little boy. If this was Lapland, you'd be boiled in a sauna and thrown into a frozen lake until the skin came off your bones. Now you're only getting pin pricks. The only prick around here is you. Fuck you. Save your jokes, comedian. You might be needing them later. Seal the ship. Seal the ship! Seal the ship! Contagion subject 5788 is loose on the vessel, apprehend on sight. Contagion subject 5788 is loose on the vessel... Buckle up, boys. Take him alive. My name is John Wood. So you've made it this far? Hey, asshole! Get over here, you little fucker. Goodnight! Please. Help me. Hide me. It's OK. I'm not going to hurt you. Your wound is infected. We have to remove the bullet. It's for your own good. Drink it. That's why it's gonna hurt. Wait. What's your name? John. Are you a doctor, John? No. Aren't you gonna ask my name? Maria. Porca Puttana cazzo Madonna. Che cazzo! Military grade. Who's after you? And how did you get here? You can stay here for a few days then you have to leave. I don't want to have any problems. I want to live in peace. Give me the axe. You need to rest. Nice clothes. Keep them. I will! Hey, timber man. We're looking for a girl. You have anyone pass through? Oi! I'm talking to you. Have you seen a girl? She's a threat. Infected. With the virus, you know. You're the first fucks I've seen in ages. Since the virus, you know. Search the place. I found it under the mattress. I know. That's some guns. You're not just a random timber man... are you? I like to prepare for war... and pray for peace. A riddle? You're the only mystery around here. So, what's next? You tell me. You're the one they're after. I can help. Start with this. You made a bloody mess. The mercenaries should have been back by now. Yes, they're dead. Oh, what makes you so sure? Well, they're not at a Sunday school reunion, are they? I'd be surprised if these... guys even finished kindergarten. They're only ever good for two things affordability and disposability. So we send another squad? Yes. And wait with reporting to Commander Stone until we know what's going on. Break it up! Attack me, come on. Your best move, now. Come on! Stop! What the hell are you doing? Your job. I'm supposed to train them, not kill them. Then step your fucking game up. I want to know how you got here. I can try. The next thing I remember is waking up here at your cabin. I fear there are more coming. They shot you with a tracking device. Not a real bullet. Do you want me to leave? Not anymore. Thank you. They said you were infected. But you have no symptoms. It's a long story. They won't give up, they're just... They... These people, the ones that's after you they killed my wife. John. You chose this. I'm sorry. You'll be safe here. Come in. Come out. Hey, how did you become so tall? Your favourite cake. Easy on the sugar, babe. It's supposed to be sweet. The only sugar I need is you. The romantic mechanic. How's the yard? Why do you think I came here? I told you you have to build the fence yourself. I'm done, silly. Fence, too? Materials arrive tomorrow. Don't worry, I'm not letting you anywhere near it. I've seen your carpentry. Praying for peace? More will come, and hell with them. You don't seem too worried. Fear is an illusion. This is very real. Pain is real, death is real. So is love, John. And life. Love ends, life ends. But death is forever. They found the cure. He wants to have it. It will change the whole world, John. The one controlling the vaccine controls the virus and the one controlling virus controls life. The vaccine belongs to the people, not one man. Why are you telling me this? Because I am the vaccine. It's in my blood. I don't want to give it to them. I want to give it to the people. It's my redemption. You just brought a lot of problems to my cabin. There's going to be a bloody mess. I need you to help me. You have to. I don't want this. Damn it. Do it for your wife! Do it for good. Help me to get my blood to the people. It needs cleaning. What? The wound is fine. The gun. What's your story? I told you, I am the vaccine. Not that. How you handle weapons. Orphaned as a teenager after my parents died turned juvenile went from jacking ATMs... to an armed robbery. Got pretty good with that. Well, before I got caught. Sentenced 10 years in a women's penitentiary. Survived the virus as it swept through the pen. Then I was sent to the lab for testing. All the rest you know already. A jailbird, huh? I figured as much. Is it that obvious? Barcode tattoos tend to tell their own stories. You know the saying you shoot like a bank robber? I was trained not to kill. Can't kill a can. I can. Go ahead. But what if it's a hostage? No one is innocent. No one is innocent. Legend has it a mighty timber man lives in these woods. He kills the enemies of nature and he himself cannot be killed. He was born from the ashes of a forest fire where 100 people died. And he eats babies for breakfast. I can smell the shit in your pants from here, boys. The look in your eyes, priceless. That's not funny. Target in sight. Call for backup? Negative. We split the bounty three ways. Since when are we fucking bounty hunters? Since there was a prize put on the girl's arse. Focus, guys. Kill the logger and bring the girl. Easy. Nature calls. Stay alert. Time to say goodnight, Boogeyman. Goodnight. Easy. Easy! Easy. I'll kill the girl if you don't let me leave with her. I don't negotiate. There's only one road leading to this cabin. We got 30 minutes before the dogs arrive, bloodthirsty. Get your weapons and your gear. Sir, yes, sir! Up and out! Look alive! Move it! Move it! Move it! Do we have a plan how to stop them? I think we can hold 'em off until winter. But after that, a little bit harder, but doable. Time is ticking. I used to play with these when I was a kid. This won't be no play time. Good. Cos I ain't no kid no more. Hey, John? You're one bad motherfucker. Sure I am. Grab some water, things are going to burn tonight. Yep, it's her. Commander Stone, the target is finally in our hands. I told you to bring water, not mercenaries. We are under attack. The girl has escaped, send backup. It can't be that hard, you morons. He lives by a lake in a small fucking cabin and chops wood. Find that timber man, now! The fellow living here is helping her. Listen, Timberlake is going down, not the girl. I repeat, not the girl. You harm one hair on her precious skull and you're as dead as him. Got that? I have orders not to kill you but I can and will hurt you. Bad. Ciao, bella. Kill the timber man whatever the cost and me bring back my golden cargo. I want a coordinated siege of the cabin. Block all roads, seal all entrances and attack in small units from all angles. The girl can under no circumstances get away. There shall be no escape routes. We're half a click from target location. Approaching from the south. Is it really just one man? Seems like a special forces soldier to me. The efficiency, the way he kills. Then why the axe? Fuck knows. Probably wants to make it personal. OK, hold. Fuck. We need to clean up all this mess before supper. What's the point? Not finding your dead comrades is worse than finding them dead. How many have we lost? Awaiting confirmation. Awaiting confirmation? My empire is crumbling! Find out now! We've lost comms with Delta Team. Find out what happened to them, and stay alert. Granite. Come in, over. Listening. There's a tunnel, an underpass under the cabin. What do you mean? They're all dead? Where does it lead? Straight to hell. Good job. Thanks. Hey! Where are you going? Hunting. Come in. Over. Fuck. It's an old mineshaft. A tunnel system. Do we know where it leads? We do now. Prepare for all scenarios. Tunnel extraction on the cargo. And should that timber man slip inside you take a small group and you flush him out. And I will make sure he gets a very special warm welcome on the other end. Target approaching. - Well, well, well. So, this is where you've been hiding all these years, huh? C'mon! Stop! Drop it. Get your hands in the air. I have eyes on the package. West side of the cabin, by the waterfront. Freeze! Target acquired. Going underground. Rendezvous coordinates, 057. Copy that, Feltspat. We're en route to that location. Keep the cargo safe. And you guys will never believe who our timber man is. Come in, Feltspat. Our timber man... Repeat? Is John Wood. John. Come in. The good doctor is out of radio reach but has acquired the target. Rendezvous at the coordinated pickup site for surface extraction. Gentlemen. Yesterday, you were all lost sheep and today we rejoice towards the future as shepherds. They say one man cannot rule the world but with an army of leaders this desolate landscape we now call the world shall be rebuilt again in an image of impenetrable rule of furious... Sir. Sir, sir. Feltspat wasn't there. And neither was the cargo. Three, five. I should be here. I am here... Oh, shit. Shit. Good to see you again, Doctor. You. You really need to learn how to die. Reinforcements. Send 'em in. Get him, flush him out, kill him and get the fucking girl. Now! Let's go. How many? All of them! You need to learn how to kill. John. John. Fan out! - Go around the ladder. - Go, go, go, watch his back! Two minutes. That will be the two last minutes of your life. They're catching up. It's like an infinite supply. They're like cockroaches. That's why the world made exterminators. Shots fired, shots fired. - They're heading for the... - Got the target! Put 'em down! - Secure the exits! - Move out of the way! Move, move, move! Get down! Take cover! Down! Back up, back up! I'm out, reloading. Get ready. Behind you! Take the shield. We've got to get out of here. Go, go, go, go, go. Stay close, stay close. Move. Go, go, go, go! John? Go, go. Keep moving. Go, go, go! Stop. Get in here. Boys, come on. Move! - Go, go, go! - This way! Stay here. No. You need to trust me. There's no time. No, I don't want to lose you. Life is nothing but lies. All we can do is live. I don't want to live without you. You will. John Wood, what a surprise. Our dear timber man is John Wood. The defector who escaped his sentence. Now I know why this woodpecker was such a pain in the ass. It was John Wood. Welcome home. Nuh-uh-uh-uh, don't kill him. Not just yet. He's an old friend. Friend? Is that what you call family these days? Ah, yes. Friend. That's as close as you will ever get again my dear... brother. And you should be honoured by that notion. You can change your name but you can never change your blood. Wood. I always thought that sounded too soft. My name's Stone. Commander Stone. Besides, Father always favoured you. His favourite woodsman. But he's not here now, is he? To save your ass from another beating this time. And actually, you can change your blood. That's the whole reason why we're here. The girl! Where is she? The girl, John. Hand her over. I killed her. There were two things you were never really good at. Killing innocents and lying. Where is she? I killed her. We can't find her, she's gone. Then she's missing, not dead. And I'm pretty sure she's around here somewhere. So, please, with some conviction here my dear brother will tell us exactly where she is. Guys, beatdown time. This can be easy, John. It doesn't have to be high school all over again. Enough! Had enough, tough guy? Are you ready to speak now? You ready to talk to me, John? John? She's dead. Gone. For fuck's sake! This is pointless. Kill him. Coward! Are you afraid of a half-dead man? Last man down, you and me! Oh boy, we're really back in high school again, aren't we? You really want to do this? You and me. Come on! You never knew when to quit, little brother. Did you? Always wanting to impress, always struggling to catch up. But guess what? Today, you did catch up. Catch up to your own death. But you've been dead to me for many years. But it's about time that you join your wife in hell. Give me a gun. Give me the fucking gun! John, turn around. Turn around! Turn around. You chose this. I was planning to do that myself. Thank you for saving me the trouble. Go fuck yourself. You're the only one getting fucked around here. Stop! Back away from him, you assholes. Or you will be wearing my bloody antidote to your own funerals! No. I'll come with you... but you let him live. Don't. Good girl. Take her to the chopper. Yes, ma'am. I'll find you. The new blood of the future has arrived. Hello. Sovereignty is never given. It is claimed. Taken. We must let go of the old and embrace the new. The children of yesterday will adapt to the revised constitution. These laws will be governed by the select few. Mainly us. Spring has a way of welcoming all of us but only the fittest survive the winter. To the north. The new dawn. The beginning of a new era... that is ready to greet you. Dear John if anything happens to me you will find three vials of my blood in your fridge. Promise to give my blood, the antidote, to the people. That is my last and only wish. Yours, Maria.
