Respectful Children-sending Goddess, please bless Xianyun and her family so she could have a baby boy soon. Grandpa... I have something to do, you go back first. We've made some money, 10 yuan for you. Still 10 yuan after all these years? Well, you did the same thing every time. Prices have risen for everything. I know, but you didn't have to do much. Just take it. Make sure you're home to eat fish bladders. Sorry, the number you dialed is powered off. If you want a callback for Hunan Mobile users please dial 1259 as prefix. I'm going to check my stocks. Dude, you do that every day. Fuck this shit! It went down 4 points. Because I'm working on this case today I've lost several months' salary. I'm going to kill the rapist as soon as I catch him. He's such a jerk. Relax man. Heavy rainfall flushed garbage into the river jamming all river channels in Meicheng with strong cold air blowing from the north. The weather in November will be unpredictable. There will be sudden heavy rainfall. Even rarely seen winter-thunder in southern mountain area. We expect to see winter arriving earlier. Wash your parts yourself. Don't push me, big sister. It's annoying. I can't go with you now. Why? Mom doesn’t want me to go out. She's worried after our schoolmate's death. Will your mom give your cellphone back? No idea. But it's not me who got raped and murdered. Come have dinner! No! Lynn, get your cousins. Come on! Rascals, you have to eat! Get them! Don't... Don't what? Go. You did so badly in the exam. Why are you still on your cell? You can have your phone back at the end of term. You will soon be in senior year. Don't bring shame on No. 1 High. My keys. Show me. You bitch... It's hard to enter a top-class university. And there's intense competition for the police academy. Lynn needs extra classes to get in. The typhoon stopped our work in Zhuhai... Please allow me a few more days to pay you. I'll pay the fees with next month's tuition. OK then. Lynn's here studying. Shall I call her? Lynn, it's your mom. She won't answer. Then let her study. Fine. See you. I'm going out. Remember to shut the door. OK. Here's the money. Just one box? I'm not hungry. Don't. Come on! You little thief, don't be shy. Don't... please... You can send this to your mom. Why? I don’t miss her. You can have this again when I get mine back. You don't have to give it back. It's a gift. Have some. Feed me. A big mouthful. Open your mouth. You are hungry! Let’s sell this phone. To whom? Some nerds. There are so many... You can sell yours, but not mine. I mean you could steal a few more. More? There's no difference stealing 2 or 100. I can't. The cellphones are locked up. And not everyone has this kind of photo. We can copy this photo on to other cells. Give me some money. Give me some! Let me go. What do you wanna do? Can you do me a favor? I'd like to send a message in your chatroom to sell this phone. Don't annoy me. You can use the public phones at school. My mom is looking for me. Where is my comb? I don't know. Grandpa, have you seen my comb? You liars! Don't hide my stuff! Grandma, I'll stay the night at May's. Dance with me... If you won't dance why did you get me here? I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the wings he bought me. Kick the fat man off. Come on. Shit. Useless pig! Calm down. I don't know why you're so angry. Screw him! Beijing fatty... I can't come to meet you. Mom wants me to stay with the retard... These hi-tech healthcare products can deal with your chronic diseases. Hypertension, Diabetes, Cancers... I can't let you in. Why? You have to be 45 or above. We're here to see her grandpa. Do you have tickets? Can I buy one now? It's sold out. I just want to take a look, OK? Chen! You have to leave! Sorry. Manager Xu, there's a lucky draw today again. Please help me make a big fortune. Here's 2880 yuan. Uncle, just give the money to the staff. I don't trust them. I only trust you. I'll only do it if you do this for me. Otherwise I won't join in the draw. OK, I'll get you a lucky number. Here's the money. Take it. Thank you so much! I wish you good luck. The purifier can really help your granddaughter do better in her senior year. There are also many other gifts today. You're the only person I trust. Don't forget to take your gifts. I'm here. Have you brought the phones? I'm not that silly. I was worried about you. I think we'll make the deal. Why would he choose this place? He sounds like a young man. This is the hairstyle I chose for you. It's a good one for long hair. I don't think so. Is that him? I don't know. You need to buy tickets. We are waiting for someone. The bus is about to move out. To Yiyang? 42 yuan. You have to get off. Liar. Give me the phone. The Samsung one. Hurry. Don't look back. Curly hair goes with your features. I have such a round face. That's cute. I will go see your friend now. With your hair out of your eyes, a whole new world appears before you. I'm opening a Changsha branch. You'll be my models. I'll put your photos in the salon so customers can see the before and after. You are the best examples, the best models - would you like that? Sounds good! And you? Good. Then let's take a photo. Drink more. You hold your drink well! Wow, bottoms up! You should drink more, come on. You hold your drink really well! This beauty too. Both of you hold your drink well. Don't pretend you can't drink more. I can't compete with you! Shake a bit so the sugar melts. Make a pose and take a photo. Would you like to take one, too? Come here, Corn. Take Lynn to my room. May? When did it begin to rain? Why did you leave? I slept in the next room. I'll pick you up after school. Bite it! Open your mouth! Fatty. Hold her. Don't move! Mannie, she spit it out. How dare you? Tell me, who are you dating? Who are you trying to seduce with the new hairdo? You're wearing jeans inside. Don't move. Cool! Fuck! That’s my chili sauce! Red underwear! I'm scared... She thinks it looks nice. You're one who didn't want to answer. Now you have to bear this. Let me help you get dressed. Don't shout! Let her go. Leave her alone. Auntie... You can go. I won a prize and many gifts! Really? I'll get my husband to enter too. The air here is pretty good. The subscriber you're calling is busy now, please try later. The subscriber you are trying to reach is currently unavailable. Hello? I only have a Xiaomi. Mmm... Are you really a student at No. 1 High? This was confiscated by the school, right? Give it back. You're not the one who called me, are you? Follow me. Take it. Why are you so in with the police? My dad is the police chief. May? May?! Your cousins are on the way to school. You're really too slow! Why didn't you knock? I don't do that in my own house. Get out. It's so delicately made... Have you flown in a plane? No. Does your father want you to be police? I want to be a pilot. Police can go nowhere. My mom wants me to be police. You can use this phone. Why? A thief cannot become a policewoman. I'm not a thief. You should return the phone to the teacher. Take it, I'm about to buy a new one. "No photos" May, I can see your home from the Pagoda. I'll send you a photo. It's so small. I'll find you more. You are such a chicken. Take this one. Your reward. Here. Serious? Take this one. Is it good? Try it. It's very sweet. So tart. Eat up! Eat them both! Hey my schoolmate, I'm just too busy now. It's the opening party for my E-mart. Don't call me big boss, I'm just "serving the people". OK, see you tomorrow at 10 a.m. Can I open the bag? You can open it later. Take it. Auntie, thank you. Where is your big cousin? I'll call her. Lynn? Mom? Why aren't you at your extra class? It's almost vacation. Thanks, mom. You should trim your nails. Have some tea. 300,000 yuan is a huge number for me. With that I can buy 30 vans. There are two supermarkets in Meicheng, but with the new E-mart I just started, customers can shop on their cellphones. It's so convenient! I'm short of cash, so my business is stuck. I can only continue if I pay the mortgage. Only close relatives will lend you money. The money will be for investment, you know I'll pay 30% interest. I see. My construction project is starting soon. It'll be profitable so I can pay the mortgage. I'll personally thank you for granting the loan. Is the new sweater I bought too small? What's wrong? I'm taking a shower. Would you like something to eat? No. What's wrong? Stomachache? Let me see. Would you mind if I take off your pants? What medicine do you want to buy? Do you have pregnancy tests? Yes. 1 yuan. You should consider his suggestion. Come back home to be with your daughter. She'll have a better future. You've been working in the south for so long, working so hard with no support from your husband. You don't have money for the big project. And the smaller ones won't sustain. Just come back, shoulder my burden. I'll be your guarantor. What more can I do as your father? I'm just an old man... Sign it, please. Work hard on your classes. I'll deal with the money issue. You take care. I have been waiting so long. I'll take you to meet my dad next time. You nearly got it. Go and buy rice noodles for me. Three bowls. Hi. Where are you? I'm in an internet café. Buy 3 bags of betel nut. My dad's back. May I borrow 500 yuan? May, I'm out of town. I'll give it to you when I get back. You could e-transfer money, I need it now. Did you sell the phone? Don't mess it up. Why do you want to enter the Police Academy? Because it sounds safe. Bingo. So quick! I just let you pass a few minutes ago! Is it inappropriate for me to stay? No, it's OK. Have an orange. What did your dad say? He said he has a friend who's a teacher at the Police Academy. And... You made a good impression. Really? You did well. Here's my treat. Do me a favor. Here? I don’t want to. One more time? Not today. I just did you a big favor. It's your turn. I really don't want to. Just one time. Hurry up. Just do it for me. One last time? Undress yourself. May, could you look at my friend's test? There seem to be two stripes. Is she pregnant? May, could you look at my friend's test? There seem to be two stripes. Is she pregnant? Are you May's classmate? I'm her friend. Is this place far away? I'll take you there. Thanks for coming, Teacher Mo. They are the Taoist Priests. Thanks for providing the funeral venue as it can't be done in Meicheng Amitabha. Please come in and have some noodles. She was adopted to be married to this boy who is a cerebral palsy patient. She didn't want to marry him. Jumping off the Pagoda was to get revenge on her adoptive parents. What a pity, such a beautiful girl. Teacher Mo, we lost our adopted daughter suddenly, will the government compensate our loss? Not possible. What about the school? But she didn't die at the school. She didn't go to school. I called you many times but you never answered. Mom, I want to pee. Mom, pee! Mom, pee! Mom, pee! I'll take you. Get... up! Why are you here? Try and stand up. You are not welcome! We’re off. You can come back tomorrow. We’re off work. What did you do that day? That day? That night. What did you do to May? Who is May? You've forgotten? You forced us to drink. I don't know what you are talking about. Did you rape me? Are you nuts? You should know if you're raped. You're crazy. Nuts. You say you don't know us? There are photos on your phone! So what? What do you want? Give it to me. There are photos on your phone! So what? It proves you knew us and forced us to drink! And? Give me my phone. You killed May! Rapist! Murderer! Give me the phone. I will tell everyone! You have a venereal disease! It's broken. You have to buy me a new one. I bought it a month ago. Do you have the money? Do you know how much it cost? You need to pay me. You know? Don't run! Can I use the toilet? Sure, over there. Dawei, what are you doing? Can you call me? The standard rooms have gone. Will you take a luxury one? How much? 158 yuan. OK? Can you make it cheaper? No. OK. I need your ID. May I use my grandpa's? Has he stayed here? Yes. Name? Lin Zifan. I don't want to give you a blowjob today. Hear me? I don't want to do it today. Then why did you ask me to come? No reason. You know the rapist hasn't been caught? It was you, wasn't it? You'd be fine even if it was. Your dad is the police chief. No one will dare touch you. Blowjob! That's all you know! Rape me if you dare. Fuck. I thought you were a virgin? Why didn't you bleed? How come? Tell me. Liar. Excuse me. Lynn, come with me. The 11.12 homicide case has been solved thanks to the police. Our condolences to the family of the victim... Come in. We also suggest that everyone should protect themselves in the era of social networks where people meet strangers easily... Take a seat. Grandpa and Lynn, the police agreed for us to handle this quietly. You are lucky that money will solve the problem. How much did you get from selling the phone? Are you dumb? How much did you get? 400 yuan I give you the money, you go get them back. Get the phone back. That's not possible. You have to use money. The Samsung is 2500 yuan... The VIVO... 1000 yuan Xiaomi is 800 yuan 4300 in total. Make it 4000. I don't need to take a look. I know nothing about phones, but since they're all used... Can I pay half? 2000? That won't work. I have no access to that much money. I have to lie to her mom for more money. Please let them know that I'll pay. Who gave you a phone?! I stole it, OK? How dare you! I'll go to hell then! Go to hell! You lied to me! I want to die! Give the phone back to the teacher! Enough! She's no longer a child! Then you take charge of this! Return the water purifier, get the 4000 yuan back. No, I won't! I want to be their star! That way I get more gifts! Don't take it out on me! If the school can guarantee that nothing like this happens again, I can forgo the money. We'll work on our disciplinary measures. So you're OK with this? What about Juan? I'm fine if you don't tell my parents I am addicted to my phone. No problem. How about Mannie? Me? I say we send her to the police. Don't be so mean to your classmate. Stealing is against the law! In Burma people are beheaded for stealing. She stole our privacy. It's criminal behavior. You must take her to the police. What’s your opinion, Grandpa? Don't be so stubborn. Listen to your teacher. No. The police should deal with this! That's what our teacher tells us. Don't be so mean to your classmate. You can use the money to fix your failed double eye-lid surgery! My eyes are none of your business! You are so ugly! Better than you! Don't you hit her. I never hit her! Let's calm down and find solutions. OK, I'll talk to her. Do you like my double eye-lids? Big problem! How dare you hit Mannie?! She started it! You thieves! Nonsense! Old fool! Now 2000 yuan is not enough to settle this. Grandpa, please prepare 4000 yuan. I'll try my best to convince them not to go to the police. Please take Lynn and your bird home. Hello. Where is Manager Xu? He went back to Shenzhen because his father fell ill. He told me you can get your refund. We only need your receipt and ID card. I have them here. He had a message for you. We've increased our advertising budget to 300,000 yuan. You can get the new product for free. But if you take the money back now then you'll miss all these great gifts. Would you like to think it over? I see... Here is the gift from the manager. It’s a precious jade that can bless your good health. Thanks a lot. Don't worry. Our company will treat you well. Take this bird as a gift to the manager. I can’t take it. It's nature's bounty. Thank you. You are so generous. Well, guess I won't ask for my money back. I'll take a photo to remember this bird. Where did you dump the corpse? The exact spot? Tell us! Tell us quickly where it is? Over there? Where is it? Hurry up! The yard used to be here, and the room there. The house is demolished. So where is it? Hurry up. Get off, boys.
