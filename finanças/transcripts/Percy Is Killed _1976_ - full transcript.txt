You know, Luca, I think my father only lives for the business. I've worked for him for years and I think the business has consumed him. But we have all the fun. To think, there are people who play ping-pong. Not everyone has the courage to risk their lives on the track. - That a challenge? - No! Your father will fire me if I win. You're kidding. You're indispensable. - I can always work for you. - You already do. Friendship isn't a job, it's a privilege. - Of course, I'm forgetting. - If you lose I'm telling everyone. - Good luck. - That's a jinx. - Then I take it back. - Shit! 'Why They Kill Themselves' - The Shit - My father's going to fire you. The boss can always do that. Anna. Hi. What do you mean, who is it? Were you sleeping? You sound strange. I'm having lunch at home, we're celebrating an engagement. We can meet this afternoon. Sure I do. Then I'll see you later. Such an occasion should be celebrated by the family first... because, as the old proverb goes... keep the bottle at home and throw the cork out the window. You're always so witty. Alessandro, you can call me dad, if you like. - It's a little early. - There's no need to be formal. It's you youngsters who always do everything in a hurry. Right, but she's very shy and jealous of her private life. You need to understand her. I wonder if she'll have the courage to tell me she loves me. - That will take some nerve. - In what sense? In the sense that when you tell someone you love them... One of the two ends up believing it. That's a good one. Where did you hear it? Experience. Alessandro will have a modern wife in Gianna... but he won't need to worry about her morals. Talking about these things while we eat... it sounds like you're comparing our feelings to food. It's a valid observation. That's what happens, feelings get treated like a dish. Disgusting, perhaps, but appetising for the vultures. Instead of doing anything my son finds pleasure with words. I was telling Luca that I didn't set up the business just for myself. Tradition is tradition, I propose a toast to Gianna and Alessandro. May they have a long happy life. Don't be so disrespectful, we're celebrating your sister's engagement. You see, you remember some things after one glass... - But after a bottle you forget. - You don't like me, do you? - Not as much as champagne, I'll admit it. - Why must you ruin such a beautiful day? - That suits you very well. - Is this the way to talk to your father... after I've worked all my life? Then I got it all wrong. Say it. I got it all wrong! No, you've never messed up at work. Andrea. Come, let's make love. I don't love you anymore. - Anna, who is it? Do I know him? - Yes, it's my father. - Don't lie to me as well. - When have I ever done that? You know what my father thinks, he spent his life working for you. I don't give a damn about the business, everyone knows that. But he's just a simple worker, and he hates me dating the boss' son... You're just a dirty capitalist to him. Is that the only reason we're splitting up? No. But I can't say anymore. You see Luca is the right man in the right place... He fits in perfectly with his surroundings. He's reserved, quiet, patient... - He's diligent. - You remind me of Freud... He knew nothing about himself and wanted to know everything about everyone else. - An interesting character. - I don't think my observations are wrong. But Andrea really is a fish out of water... He walks around the house like an animal in a cage. Yes, that's what everyone thinks, but he was born here, it's his house. Listen to the last chapter, I think it's highly appropriate. I get the impression some men aren't born where they should be. Chance has thrown them into a determined location... but they still miss the homeland they've never seen. - That's right, isn't it? - It applies to you as well. I never questioned my existence. My brother lives in total isolation, he isn't even a friend to me. Just as he isn't to my father. Except for Luca he doesn't have any friends. But not even Luca can make him see how lucky he is. - He lives here like a guest. - An unwanted guest. While you're like a column in this house. You prop up the weight of an old man who could fall at any moment. I bet if I opened a window you'd turn to dust. You're not funny at all. Excuse me, Paola. Cheers! What do you see in that photo? It isn't the first time you've looked at it. It's probably because I like the uniforms. It's true, we all have our own secrets. - Are yours pleasant enough? - It depends on if you understand them. Andrea, your father is going to the chapel. He's alone. Go to him, you can take my place quite easily... It isn't me he needs anyway. What can I tell you that you don't already know? Perhaps you understand me more than my son who never met her. I never met her either. But the most incredible thing is that her death avoided another one. Sometimes I don't think it's right that we're the only ones who know... and that Andrea is so distant. Andrea is closer than you think. Bad day? We try to at least make sure the night is different. You're already off to a bad start. Not very original. You don't have much imagination. Stop it. Don't ruin everything. This isn't why we're here. Sorry, but try to understand. I don't want this to start and end just like everyone else does. It would be too simple, too stupid. I thought we were going to make love, not do crosswords. You're right, it's my fault. I should've told you. You see, I'm not like all the others. I'm not who you're looking for. I'm different. Perhaps it's better if you see for yourself, come with me. Going somewhere nice? A masked ball? - What gutter did you crawl out of? - Given the place, I'd say it was hell. - My name's Judas. - And you'll sell yourself for 30 dinars? No, also for less! My mother gave me this great name because I was born by mistake. Who knows? It might have been the plumber or the postman. Let's go. Have fun. Be very careful about what you're going to see... Something about it fascinates me, and I'm sure it will fascinate you as well. Satan we suffer for you. I do not know your face, or your voice... but through pain you will be reborn. What's wrong? Don't be like this. Did it get to you? - Fuck you! - I got you wrong. You're just a spoilt kid, worse than your father. No, you idiot. I don't believe in God so why should I believe in the Devil? You'll believe when he comes back, you'll see. The night our Lord of Darkness has created for us tastes of burnt flesh. Tell us we are worthy... because the body will restore your sanctity of pleasure! Is this all you've got? I haven't stepped out of high school. This is just a taste. - As long as you're not shooting up. - Why limit yourself? Because I'm not like you. - Where's Paola gone? - Come, let's find her. According to custom, you must kiss a stranger... transmitting what is left of you into her. Now leave her to me. My brother will never be a good disciple. - What about Anna? - I haven't heard from her. And you don't understand anything, right? Yet it isn't so hard to understand. Nothing lasts forever. Eternity is a myth. Sometimes I think about the randomness of meetings. Why are we so surprised when we break up? Sure, but Anna had no reason to leave me. She just left with any explanation. Your problem is you ask too many questions. I'm not a mole. Well sometimes it's better to live in the dark. - You as well? - Sure. The candle never really goes out. Even when you know it's a failed relationship. Take me and Luisa. Your typical love story. A daughter. Then it all turns to dust. All I have left is Stefania, even if, at times... It's all nonsense. Let's forget about the past. It really is true... we're all forced to live our own truth. Andrea, let's go. Luca, do you want to dine with us? I'm sorry, but I can't. I have to pick up Stefania. That's good, Luca... Even if you aren't married, you're a great father to Stefania. And that makes Luca the perfect man. It's always Luca. Luca is a trusted colleague, furthermore, he's also a friend to both of us. I can't even tell you treat him like a son because you treat him much better. - Are you missing something? - No, I have money, a car... I'm not missing anything. But you talk to him. And I'll talk to you as well, to get things straight, once and for all. I was the commander of a platoon during the war. Before your mother died at headquarters, she made one last wish... She asked me to save someone's life as hers was about to end. They were executing a French soldier in the courtyard. It was Luca. I spared him... respecting your mother's wishes. It may seem strange, but that's why I wanted him to work alongside me. We've been expecting you. Stefania's ready. - She can't wait to go out with you. - At least somebody does. We're too old to play games. What part of life isn't a game? I just play with my memories. I'm not hurting anyone. That's what you say. Everything okay at work? Yes, fine. It's just that Andrea... Andrea isn't your son. Please try to think about Stefania a little more instead. I have to go. - Is that you dad? - No, it's Andrea. Come in. Listen... Did you know the story about dad and Luca? - What story? - Surviving the firing squad. I thought firing squads never missed. I'm sure you know something about it. Who cares about what happened in the past? You're right. The present is often more surprising. - When are you getting married? - Next month. Congratulations, little sister. I've seen Anna. It sounds crazy but I saw her! And I'm telling you you've got Anna on the brain! But I saw her face. It was her, and she wasn't alone. Go and freshen up. It might straighten you out. - Haven't we met? - Where is she? Who? - I don't like ghost stories. - But ghosts exist. What have you done? Why? Son of a bitch! Get your hands off me. You might be upset to learn that Anna prefers miracle water to you. It may not be holy but it's a different kind of miracle. You can use it everywhere, even in the toilet. Andrea, I was waiting for you. You don't know it, but I'm happy. Don't leave me. Come with me. - Have you seen Andrea? - Yes, he left. - Alone? - No, with some kids. - You know them? - Never seen the girl before... but the guy is a real low-life. They hang around the old cemetery. I don't know how someone like Andrea... If I could make you disappear off the face of the earth... Don't you know shitheads are the hardest ones to get rid of? And anyway, their stink sticks around like incense in a church. And, if you get any funny ideas about attacking me... Remember, those carcasses, as you see them... with what I give them to stick in their body... wouldn't think twice about killing you. Now go, go to your sleeping beauty. How can we... How can we go back to how we were before? How we used to smile. Perhaps there's only one way. There's only one way, Anna. Have you finished, doctor? As the family doctor, yes, but by law I should report this. Why? Because some kid drank too much and threw up? You surprise me, Luca. I'll be blunt... That kid injected a high dose of methedrine, he could've died. What can we do? You're his friend. Listen to me, don't ignore him. For now I'll pretend I didn't see or hear anything. Thanks. I just hope it's the last time for him, for me, and his father. - How do you feel? - I was happier before. Imbecile. No, you don't get it. When I was there, in that world... I was close to him but I felt so distant at the same time... Sometimes, I'm worse than your father. I'm glad you're devoting the necessary attention to the family... that I unfortunately cannot allow myself to do. Perhaps I was wrong to talk to you about Andrea... but you see he frequents the same places as my friends. Even in front of Alessandro, I don't think it's right. No, you did very well. Come in. I only have five minutes. The first numbers are coming in. I'm not at all interested in the business this morning. I hear Andrea's been behaving very strangely... and it's also happening when he's with you, getting drunk in nightclubs. He's tarnishing the Viotti name. What are you getting at? That I'm corrupting some irresponsible kid? Let's be frank, I'm not a cop or a social worker for that matter. It isn't what I meant, but your friendship means a lot to him. I know exactly what you meant. You want me to take your place because you can't accept the responsibility. Well it's too late for you and for Andrea. You can do what you like to me. Let's not argue over this. Excuse me. I was distracted. You're forgiven. Living alone, you forget certain things. You think it's too early for me to retire? You used to be a lot more careful. You haven't kept count of how many times I've lit your cigarette. No. But I did keep count of all the times we made love. What does that mean? My regret at not being enough for you. What is love, daddy? Finish your ice-cream, Stefania. - Love is caring about someone. - Then you love me, daddy. - Of course. - Stop it, Luca. - For the girl. - Also. It isn't working out? Yes, of course, from the moment we're together... and even if it wasn't like that. Do you remember what you said? Love is a season. Is it still summer for you? I think autumn's about to start. Look at this, the prodigal son has returned. What brings you here? Take me to her. You never go to your woman empty handed. I don't have any problems. The gentleman doesn't have any problems. Okay, great, but you've got to understand me, the stuff costs. Tibici, come here, I want you to meet a real gentleman. Good evening, I'm Tibici, but only in appearance. It may not look it but my business requires an exceptional temperament. If the introductions are over, out with the stuff. This is all I can give you tonight, you should be happy, it's quite a lot. Don't be greedy, there's no such thing as private property here. I'll look after it. Come, let's find Anna. This is another planet. The gentlemen here are U.F.O's. Anna. What did you think? That I'd trip without you? This time we'll trip together. Gently, like you do. Be honest, are you doing it just for me? I don't know, maybe for you... for me... maybe for no one. I commanded a platoon during the war. No! Go away! I hate you! Good evening, Mr. Giro. - It's time we got to know each other. - Who are you? My friends call me Judas, but you don't know me. I don't mix with high society, except for Andrea Viotti. A dear friend. You know that kid isn't so different to my friends. He scores, shoots up, he says strange things... The only thing that's different is his surname. An important name. Rich! Your name doesn't kid around either. That's right, I'm not kidding. And I don't think Mr. Viotti will be happy to see his boy in all the papers. Photographed at a particular moment. - Do you want money? - A lot. Cheque okay? - Your signature. - Then write 'fuck you'. Now it's going to cost you a lot more. Need a hand? I know where your father keeps his money. Isn't it funny. To get out of the family... and away from the wealth you hate so much... you have to steal your father's money. You don't mind being a Viotti now. Remember, you're just an employee, you have no authority here. You just have to stay close to me because, if my father pays you... That's all he pays you for! What happened? Accident at work? - I hope you're insured. - You sent them. You were behind it. You wouldn't have given a damn if they'd killed me. Anything to get that junk! Well I'm here! It was a nasty surprise... - but Luca isn't Luca anymore! - It wasn't me! - Look me in the face. - Stop, it's me, Andrea. It wasn't me. I would never have done something like that. You've got to believe me. You've got to. Tell me the truth. This isn't about Anna anymore. Yes, it's true. Anna doesn't exist anymore. But that stuff makes me forget my loneliness... my father's face, my sister's hypocrisies... the home I've always hated. - I destroy... - Only yourself. There aren't just secrets of love, right? There are also those between brother and sister. Provided they remain a secret. Goodnight. I'm glad we came here. It was a good idea. Give me your rifle, I'll load it. Mine's already done. Right, you're an expert in the field. You don't need a war to learn how to shoot. - Just pull the trigger. - To kill? You go hunting to kill, otherwise what's the point? I'll go ahead, I know the area. Andrea! - Good day, thanks. - Goodbye. - How did it go? - Hard work but very productive. They welcomed me like a real saviour in Munich. I helped them, yes, sure, that's what they were expecting... - but I removed the major... - There's something more important. - Andrea's disappeared. - Disappeared? What do you mean? Just that. A lifetime spent working and this is the result, a junkie for a son. I've always given him everything. Whatever he wanted he got. I never refused him anything. And how does he repay me? He'll pay for this. Perhaps we should be asking ourselves why Andrea ended up like that. Reasons? Like there could be reasons. If his father had been a simple worker, and him a dustman... Daddy, don't get angry. We can always send him to a clinic. Yes, sure. Why trouble yourselves? But he doesn't just need a clinic, and you know that better than me. No, we don't know. Go on, you tell him. Hold on. I think Gianna's right. First of all, Andrea needs to kick this foolish habit. I'll call them. You won't win his trust just by picking a phone. Trust? Trust in what? Don't be so melodramatic. Right now Andrea is just a pathological case, that's all. The only pathological thing around here is your indifference. Our morals are our dignity in front of the world, don't forget that. Where are you going? I'm going to look for our mutual acquaintance, but I call him a friend. Once again another season ends. What brings you here? - Is Luca with you? - No, I'm alone. - Surprised? - Yes, in a way. You're always together. Has something happened? I need to be alone. I'd like to stay here for a few days. Don't say no. - And don't ask me why? - Sorry, Andrea, I can't. I'm scared of what you'll do, and the people around you. And if Luca found out. Who is this Luca? I don't know him. What are you doing? Stop it. - Don't you like it when I touch you? - That's enough. You're crazy. Just go. You're ridiculous. If you think you're better than him you're mistaken. Wait! Where are you going? I didn't mean to upset you. Don't be like that. You've got it wrong. I want a bit, just a bit. Don't leave me like this. Please, give me a bit. Damn it, give it to her. - You got the money? - No. No money, no shit. Judas has got some, it's not true. Go on, give it to me. Come on. Okay, there's no need to fight. Judas has taken care of everything. Andrea, come here for a moment, before you get high. Everyone out! What do you want? Can't you just leave me alone? The situation is very simple and you can't change it. You don't have any money, and if you don't have any... I gave you the drugs but that's also going to run out. Anna will suffer again, and so will you. So will my little orphans, and I need to take care of them. I need to feed them something. So we need to find a way to get the shit without paying for it. Okay, but that's enough now. I'll do what you want. She stole my dose! It was the last one. Don't let it get to you. - It isn't our fault Anna's dead. - Yes, I know. - Thank god I've got you as a friend. - Good. Now your friend Judas is going to take you somewhere nice. Let's go find the others. - Shall I put these next door? - Okay, then get some rest. I'll be here all night. - Who is it? - Open up. Hi, Tibici. - We want some condoms. - We're closed. You shouldn't come here. You know that. I know, but we really want to fuck, and we're scared of diseases! I can't give you anything they're doing more checks now. So they should, with all those junkies out there! Besides my assistant is next door, you don't want to ruin me. - Andrea, go and shut her up. - What are you doing? Leave her alone. She's sleeping. Now let's have a little chat, man to man. Look! The lady's scared, we need to do something! Where the fuck is it? Not the money! Where is it? Are you going to tell us? That box there, on the other shelf. See where good manners gets you. The money? Excuse the mess but she wouldn't let me medicate her. We've also had our problems but it isn't over for you. - Why? Is something wrong? - Yes. You don't understand us. But we want to be understood, and there's only one way to do that. - Get it ready. - Yes, I already took care of it. What are you going to do? Are you crazy? - I could die! - No! Come on, behave. Take this medicine for your brain. - Then you'll understand. - Don't fool around. You wouldn't hurt an old man! When the old man is a son of a bitch like you, yes! And now, let's get on with the show! Go on, do it. We're waiting. What do I have to do? I have to teach you everything, like a kid. - That'll teach him. - Piece of shit. - I wonder if Snow White wants some? - Let's ask her. - Holy shit! - Get out of here! We wouldn't be searching a public toilet if it wasn't for that tip-off. I'm not doing anything! I'm here with Anna! Let go of me! I'm okay with her! Luca, let go! Where are you taking me? I never want to see you again! Will you shut up? You're busting my balls. He really is sick. I hope you haven't done something stupid? He should be in the infirmary. The shit! I can't take it anymore. - Take him to the toilet. - I want the shit. I'll pay. - I need it. - He wants shit. Let's give him some. - I can't take it anymore. - Dinner is served. This is the starter, this is the main course... and this is desert. He can tell them he ate real well inside, when he gets out. Don't let it get to you. It's not your fault. You mustn't torment yourself like this. You've got Stefania. I'm here. Yes, I know that. But you still don't get it. If you want me to come back... I need to know what I can do for Andrea. No one's ever helped him, and perhaps... Perhaps not even me. I don't think you really mean that. He didn't recognise me. I have to see his doctor. Yes, the usual scream therapy. You surprise me, our clinic is famous for its use of modern therapy. Our cures work miracles. Don't you get it? We need to get Andrea out of there. I don't think that's necessary. They're looking after him and there's Gianna's wedding in a few days. What about it? You're scared of Andrea, especially now that he's sick! It's easy for a man like you to get rid him like that. I'm trying to save him. You're only trying to save your reputation. - How dare you? - No, it's over. No more diplomacy, compromises. You must face the truth. - Come with me, the business can wait. - Where to? The hospital. - What's wrong with you? - That kid got to me. - You always fall in love. - Yes, but he isn't willing. - I know a way. - Yes? If you really needed something, what would you do? - I'd do anything. - Such as? You're asking me? Hold on, doesn't this little tube remind you of anything? Want it? Take it. You've crossed the line! Because, you see, doctor... sometimes a father's feelings can seem unreasonable... but Gianna's getting married next week, and you know how it is... I'd like to celebrate a wedding and a recovery. It's Luca. Are you listening? It's over now. You'll be out soon. I'm also tired of all of this... and I don't know how much you've suffered in here. It sure isn't a nice place. Well, I didn't... sleep well last night. What are you doing here all alone? I think you're right. It all seems like a happy funeral. The important thing is that we're together again, like before. We were never friends like we are now. Thanks, for everything. Is this where they're celebrating Gianna's wedding? Yes, it's here. Are you a guest? Let's just say I'm a friend who wasn't invited. I'm Lawyer Tabulari, I brought a gift for her. If you wouldn't mind giving it to her. No, I shouldn't. I'm better now. Then why am I thinking about it? LSD opens your mind... and I've always been scared of myself, of what I don't know... fear of the unknown. Something about it fascinates me. Another present just arrived. They saved the best till last. Let's see what it is. - Strange, I feel so emotional. - Must be the box. It's from your brother, open it. Congratulations. What's wrong? Don't you feel well? You're sweating. - Have you seen Andrea? - Yes, sir. - Where? - He was heading for the hills. - Was he alone? - Yes, but Luisa followed him... She looked concerned. Is this where your life gets better? Or is this where you destroy it? And not just yours. But also the lives of others. The people who tried to help you. What do you want to happen? For your father's business to fail? For Luca to disappear? What do you want? Do you know at least? Enough, Andrea. You're pitiful. Where's your dignity? Throw that stuff away. You've always been a burden to everyone. Stop clinging to your friends. Luca never needed it because he's a real man. Why did he do it?
