Of course, this follows the boycott of over 50 advertisers of The O'Reilly Factor after a New York Times report of sexual harassment allegations and the report that Fox and O'Reilly together spent about $13 million to settle those allegations from five different women. -So, the story... -Job well done, Emily. Thanks, Dean. And you, Mike. Excellent reporting. BOORSTIN: ...not be returning to his top-rated cable show. Are we talking solely corporate misuse of power? No, we're talking all workplaces where sexual harassment might happen. Also, let's look for the enablers. Fox kept O'Reilly on for quite some time after our story broke. And for decades before that.

(busy chatter) JODI: Hey, do you guys have a minute? MATT: Sure. So, I spoke to Shaunna Thomas, the head of UltraViolet, a feminist group. She said the wrongdoing in Hollywood is overwhelming. She's in touch with an actress, Rose McGowan, who has tweeted about being raped by a producer. Thomas says it's Harvey Weinstein and that McGowan is now working on a book about it. Wasn't he charged with something couple years ago? Yeah, um... Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, an Italian model. She claimed Weinstein groped her in a business meeting. The NYPD investigated it, but he was never charged. Talk to Rose McGowan. Try to talk to other actresses he's worked with. Yeah. And I'll try to reach ex-employees. JODI: Hi. My name is Jodi Kantor. I'm an investigative reporter for The New York Times. We're looking into sexual harassment in the workplace. I believe you were an employee at Miramax and worked for Harvey Weinstein in the '90s. WOMAN (over phone): Are you recording this? No, absolutely not, and I won't quote from this conversation without your permission.

Shaunna Thomas suggested you might be willing to have a conversation with me about Hollywood, and specifically Harvey Weinstein. -Are you writing about him? -Yes, I am. Look, I don't feel that inclined to talk to you about it. JODI: Could I ask why not? ROSE: I've been treated quite shabbily by your paper numerous times, and I believe the root of it is sexism. I'm sorry that was your experience. I've talked in the past, and nothing happened. I spoke at a political meeting recently, and The New York Times put it in the Style section. It does damage to shout, and no one listens. I'm investigating systemic sexism in Hollywood. How many pages have you got? No. I put myself on the line before, and it made no difference.

We wrapped up, and he said he'd walk me out, and I thought, "Well, that went well." It was my first big meeting. He walked behind me down a hallway, then he said, "This is the Jacuzzi room." And I looked in, and he pushed me inside. He stripped me, and he was suddenly naked. I left my body in some way. And he raped me. I went into survival mode to get out, and I faked an orgasm. He told me to get dressed. He left me messages telling me I was his new special friend and that he'd done a lot for other actresses. Did you report it? Can you see the law taking my side on that?

I went over to The Peninsula Hotel, and at reception, I asked, "Is Mr. Weinstein in The Belvedere restaurant or is he on the patio?" And they said, "Go to his room." (over laptop): And I went upstairs, and Harvey was in his bathrobe. And he asked if he could give me a massage. "No," I said. And then, um, he asked me to help him pick out his clothes for the day. He, you know, started asking for all these things, increasingly more sexual, getting closer and closer. And I just said no so many different times and in so many different ways. And then he finally, um, asked me to watch him take a shower. And I said, "Harvey, "when I win an Academy Award in a Miramax movie, I will give you a blow job." And I got out of there fast. What did you do? I told my dad, I told my agent, I told the people with whom I was filming that night, and Harvey punished me. I mean, he blackballed my career because I had the wherewithal to refuse him. How do you know that? I would be standing with other actresses, and he would blank me. There were roles for which I was up that I mysteriously did not get, and I know today that it was Harvey making a phone call. You know I did an article about it, and nobody did anything. You didn't identify him, but did industry people know who you were talking about in your article? Absolutely. And the abuse came raining down on me, not on him. You know at the Women's March when I did the "Nasty Woman" poem? I lost a huge advertising gig because a small group of people complained that I was quoting the president. He used that language and got elected. I quoted him, and I got fired. It is decades later, and it's still the same sexism.

I guess my question is just, like: Is this the best use of our time? Like, as opposed to other people we could potentially be covering. People who can't speak out. Actresses already have a voice. But they could also fear being punished by the film industry for using it. Sure. But what is it exactly that we're looking at here? We're looking at extreme sexual harassment in the workplace. These young women walked into what they all had reason to believe were business meetings with a producer, an employer. They were hopeful. They were expecting a serious conversation about their work or a possible project. Instead, they say he met them with threats and sexual demands. They claim assault and rape. If that can happen to Hollywood actresses, who else is it happening to? Do you think his employees were targeted, too? I do. I could search for any police complaints against Miramax. Or court records. Should I? Yes. MEGAN: I found records of a complaint against Miramax from 2001, but the report was closed out the same day it was made. It says, "complainant elected court action," but then no court documents exist, which seems inconsistent. Do you have any more information on that? WOMAN (over phone): No, those records would have been destroyed. Really? Why? It's agency policy. All records are destroyed after three years. Why is that? As I said, it's policy. So could you please tell me who filed the sexual harassment complaint? No, I cannot. -Because? -It's policy. We are prohibited from giving you that name. Is that everything? This is very important. It's about someone who's still very powerful in the workplace. Who could still be harassing someone. Is there any way you can help me? You could ask me the name of the government investigator who was assigned the case. I could give you that information. -Just a name. -Thank you. MEGAN: I've made 20 calls to track this investigator. What did Lisa Bloom say? JODI: She just talked as though he was kind of naughty. She was talking to me kind of Jew-to-Jew and including Weinstein in the gang. Oh.

They rarely come up in open court. Law schools don't teach them. Also, the attorneys who represent the victims can get up to 40% of the settlement. That's a big incentive to keep that system going. Most sexual harassment cases are settled out of court. And most of them have a confidentiality clause. And the women who sign these contracts have to give over all of their evidence: their diaries, emails, phones. It's cash for silence, and it enables the perpetrators to continue. MEGAN: And these clauses are standard practice. The women want to close the case. They need the money. They... They don't want to be branded as liars or flirts. I mean, I'm sure it-it often seems like the only recourse. And I imagine some women see these settlements as a confession of guilt. They think they've scored a victory when it's actually a gag order. And if you try and take a case like this to court, the sexual harassment laws are so weak. They're actually nonexistent if you're a freelancer or if there are fewer than 15 employees in the workplace. Also, most lawyers prefer settlements 'cause it's less of a financial risk for them. How close are any of these actresses to going on the record? We're introducing the idea. I'm afraid we have these horrific hotel room accounts and no corroborating evidence.

It's pressure we can do without, but we just keep going, and we continue to be thorough. Pardon me. Excuse me. Hello. Hi. Hello, everyone. Uh, did you, did you see my friend over there? He-he said hi. Could you leave us? -We're talking. -I absolutely will. I totally understand, but I was just thinking maybe I could just have a moment of your time. All right, man. We're having a conversation. So, if you could just... You should be doing something else, though. -Fuck you. (scoffs) -Fuck you? I would bend you over... Fuck you! Fuck you! Get the fuck out of here! Fuck you, man! Get the fuck out! (man laughs) -Wow. -Frigid bitches. MAN: Frigid bitches. (laughs) -MEGAN (whispers): Sorry. -Don't apologize. (scoffs) -(traffic rumbling) -(footsteps running) WOMAN: There was an incident in Venice at the film festival. It was '98. What happened? (sighs softly) What makes me most angry is the silence. No one spoke out then, and no one is talking about it now. He built the silence, and people complied. He produced fear and intimidation. The only alternative, seemingly, was to quit and throw away everything you worked so hard for out the door. You were terrified you were gonna be the next target, so people looked the other way. -Within the company? -Yes, and outside of it. I mean, he played the press. He played the agents. How did he play the press? By promising them access to stars in exchange for hushing up some incident. What sort of incident? (chuckles) Where do I start? Harvey had this-- what did they call it?-- "a physical altercation" with a male employee at a conference. Then they settled with the guy. And with women? He pursued them. Endlessly. What happened in Venice? I don't want to be quoted. Period. Understood. We were in Harvey's suite, and (sniffles) there were a bunch of people in there. And there were these two assistants, and they were sitting there trembling. And Weinstein was there? Yes. He was talking film and ignoring them, but they were literally vibrating. One with fear, the other with anger. Can you tell me their names? Yes. And there's another woman you should, you should call. The two assistants are Rowena Chiu and Zelda Perkins, and we have a third name, Laura Madden. And none of them are returning our calls. So? Show up in person. Yeah. (chuckles) They live in London, Silicon Valley and Wales. Can you get on a plane? (laughs) Let me work it out with Ron. But yeah, of course. Documents, verification.

Can I give her a message? When will she be back? My wife's out of the country for a while. (chuckles) I see. I did try calling her. This a work thing? No. You must be Andrew? Andrew Cheung? I'm Jodi Kantor. I'm from The New York Times. Okay. So, what did you want to talk to Rowena about? We're researching a story about Miramax. I flew in from New York. -You came all this way? -Yeah. (Andrew chuckles) Um, could we talk for a minute? Sure. So, I've been speaking with people who worked for Harvey Weinstein. You're going quite far back with Rowena's time there. We're writing about his treatment of women. Right. And Rowena fits in how? Your wife worked at Miramax for some years. Yes. Mainly in Hong Kong. Like to hear about her experiences working for Weinstein. I'm confused why you can't discuss it on the phone. (laughs) I did try. It is always better to actually meet. So... And this is off the record. My understanding is that... (stammers) that Weinstein possibly victimized your wife when Rowena first worked for him. Rowena's never mentioned anything like that to me. What-what do you mean by "victimized"? Can you be more specific? I was told that your wife may have received a settlement from Weinstein. (scoffs) Do I look like a guy whose wife got a settlement? Could you have confused her with someone else? I-I... I apologize for taking up your time. I'm... Will you just please give this to Rowena? If you're talking to these other people, why do you need to talk to Rowena? And if you turn up in my driveway, what kind of victimization? It's complex. I'm asking you to expand on it. I really think it would be best... ...if you asked Rowena. Have a good day. (engine starts) JODI (over phone): I just couldn't lie to him. And then it turns out he didn't know. What if London is a repeat of this? It won't be. I spoke with an employment lawyer in the U.K., and he told me that it was irresponsible of me even to ask about breaching NDAs. No one does it. They would get sued. Fuck that guy. Honestly, Jodi, fuck him. He has no idea. I wish I smoked or something. I'm staring at an actual brick wall, and all I can think is, "Fuck." That's okay. Fuck.

And we're not gonna let that happen to us. Are you okay, Zelda? Yes. So, you started working at Miramax when you were 21? Yes. I was an assistant at the London office. -And how was it? -It was great. But it would shift when Harvey came to town. In what way? Everyone became on call to Harvey. And what would that entail? Script meetings, discussions and more personal stuff. Like? For instance, I would have to go to his hotel and wake Harvey up. Run his shower for him. Get him out of bed. He would usually be naked. And he might try to pull me onto him. What did you do? I'd fend him off. I found humor or aggression worked best. Harvey was either excited or furious. You never knew which it would be. Did anyone on the team give you advice about him? Yes. (chuckles) Once, one girl told me to always wear my puffer jacket, um, and to always sit in an armchair, never the sofa next to him, which helped. And that's how I knew that it wasn't only happening to me. What was happening exactly? Bullying. Emotional abuse. I was just too young to understand it. Harvey wanted people to submit to him. And if they didn't? Well, then he'd roar. And he'd spit. He could destroy someone in seconds. Were you scared of him? Yes. We all were. So, three years into this, you were at the Venice Film Festival. I resigned after that. (sniffs) -What happened? -I can't tell you all of it. What can you tell me? ♪ Let's sway ♪ ♪ Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight... ♪ ZELDA: There was a new assistant. She was my age. She was great. (both chuckling) She was very smart. And she was doing Harvey's evening script meeting alone for the first time, and I told her to call me if he got difficult. -Was he pursuing her? -No. (chuckles softly) Harvey said, "I don't like Jewish or Asian women." -But that night... -She called you. No. (knock on door) The following morning, she came to me, and she was sobbing. -I mean, she was hysterical. -(sobbing) Rowena, what happened? Sit. -And I held her. -What is it? Did she tell you what he did? Not exactly. Only that no one must know. But I knew. I knew that he must've... What? She was so upset. I knew that it had to be the-the worst possible thing. I calmed her down, and I went straight to confront Harvey. He was in a meeting, uh, with Scorsese, who, you know... who hated him, so it was a really big deal for Harvey. And I went straight up to him, and I said very clearly, "You need to come with me right now." You went right up to them and confronted him? Yeah. I was so angry. And in front of everyone, he stood up and... he followed me like a lamb. And then I knew. Then I knew he did it. And then? He denied it. He said, "I swear on my wife and kids' lives that I did not assault that young woman." (chuckles) And then I knew that he was lying. He always used that line as a "get out of jail free" card. Always. Did the assistant report it to the police? Mm. She told no one. We came back to London. We both resigned. I told my direct superior, who suggested we get ourselves a good lawyer. I had no idea where to get one. I found a company close to the office, and-and then I thought it would be simple. Criminal proceedings. But our lawyer said we had no chance and the only thing to do was to agree to a settlement. And I said categorically no, that no money should change hands and that we just wanted to stop him. And no U.K. police were involved? We had no case. We had no evidence and no police report from Venice. And, you see, with rape, it is impossibly difficult to get a prosecution. And the lawyers kept saying damage limitation was the only way to go. So I said, "All right, then. We have our own very real demands." Conditions that Harvey would have to meet if we were to sign. And what were those conditions? We demanded that if Harvey had another settlement within two years, that it had to be reported to Disney or else he would be fired. Another was that he would go to therapy, with me present initially so that he couldn't lie to the therapist. We demanded that HR would put in a system to protect the women and staff. And it felt like if we could achieve all of those, then that's what our silence was paying for, that we were paying for him to stop. So we signed. And they had their own insane conditions for us. What were they? I tried to commit them to memory. Um, they wouldn't give us our own copy. What? I was only given visitation rights to my own settlement. That's in... (stammers) That's incredible. But you memorized them? I asked for letters, too, which stated some of the conditions. One said, "We will make best endeavors to not help the police in a criminal or civil case." We weren't allowed to talk to our family or a doctor. So finally we signed. They gave us some money. And I felt completely broken. ♪ ♪ I interviewed for other jobs afterwards, but everyone kept saying, "Why did you leave Harvey?" They all assumed that I'd... ...been with him, you know. It was horrible. What did you do then? I went to visit a friend in Guatemala, and I stayed for five years. (chuckles) I had no chance of ever working in film again, and I couldn't speak freely, so I worked with horses. You've lost a lot. (sniffs) These are the original letters. I had to have their permission if I wanted to contact a therapist or speak to an accountant. I was "never to speak to any other media, now or hereafter existing, about it."

(laughs): Yes. Yes. She's 13. (chuckles softly) You grew up in Ireland? I did, yes. And your first job was wrangling extras in '92? They were shooting near us. I loved it. And then I heard that Miramax were making a film nearby, and I got a job as a runner on that. I was ecstatic. It was great. And you met Harvey Weinstein when? Soon after that. I was going to be working directly for him. Doing errands, answering calls. I was very happy to be asked. He was charming. He was saying he'd heard how hard I worked. And I was just excited. I was 21, you know, very young but incredibly keen. So when he said he'd give me a permanent job at the London office, I felt so happy. JODI: He said that in the meeting? LAURA: Yes. He was in his bathrobe when he opened the door, but I thought that was maybe very Hollywood. But quite soon into talking, he said, would I give him a massage? I-I said no. He was very matter-of-fact. He said it's not a romantic request. Everyone does it for him. It's part of the job. So, I suddenly thought that I was the problem, you know. That I was the one who was sexualizing it. That I was just young and uptight. So, I... ...I put my hands on his shoulders, but I couldn't actually move them at all over his body. I just stood there. My hands wouldn't move. And then he said he would give me a massage first. To relax me. And he said, "Look, all the girls do it. It's just work." And then he said, "Take your top off." Very matter-of-fact. "Take your bra off." And I did. I was terrified, but I just thought, "Get through it. Do it." And then my trousers were off, and he was standing over me... masturbating. I asked him to leave me alone, but he kept asking for different things. And then he suggested a shower, and I got up. And he carried on... masturbating. And I kept crying. And I was sobbing, and the water was pouring down, and he was still masturbating. Then he got angry. I think my crying was so loud it put him off. And he left the bathroom, and I locked the door. (shower running) And I could still hear him on the other side. Still the sounds of him masturbating. Finally, I went back into the room itself and grabbed my clothes and belongings, and I just ran. I ran down the street. I've never run that fast in my life. How do you feel about it now? (sighs): I... I... I feel like it dictated a certain direction my life took. That-- I just felt that it was this huge e-error of judgment that sort of marked me and all my decisions. And... ...I felt such shame... ...that I let him do that. Did you think that he had done the same to other girls? I thought that he must've tried it. (voice breaking): But that they'd all s... ...they'd all said no. It was like he t-took my voice that day.

Dean, I heard someone was working on a story about me. Yes. If you'd like to talk to the reporters on the record, -they'd welcome that. -I want to talk to you, Dean. Well, talk to my reporters about your concerns. I'm sorry. I have work to do. Are you gonna hang up? Unless you have anything else to say. I love the truth. People make up stories a lot. Be careful of that. That's fine, Harvey. Goodbye. ♪ ♪ -Hi, Chanel. -Hey, Dean. Hey, Tim. -Matt, you got a minute? -Yeah. DEAN: So, what do we have? Well, the biggest thing is the documents that Jodi got from Zelda Perkins in London. Rose is still off the record, but she has given us permission to write about her settlement. We're just trying to figure out a way to confirm it. Harvey offered her a million dollars recently for her silence. -And? -Rose refused, but she doesn't want us to quote her. There are still no on-the-record sources. NDAs are a problem. MEGAN: Laura Madden didn't sign one. She's the only ex-assistant who is technically free to speak. Ashley and Gwyneth didn't sign one either, but they're not ready to go on the record. But Laura Madden has to deal with something -very different right now. -She has breast cancer. She has to go into surgery, so it's not likely. I'm still leaving messages for Rowena Chiu, but there's no engagement. So, no more proven settlements. Ambra Battilana Gutierrez almost certainly settled. And John Schmidt confirmed that Miramax settled with the woman I visited in Queens. Anything more on the article from The New Yorker? No. Lanny Davis and David Boies want to come talk to us. What do you think? Don't we want to wait and push for an on-the-record interview with Weinstein? It's your call, Binky. I'd like to talk to Lanny at least. See what he has to say. LANNY: Harvey's not always that rational. The reason I'm here as his representative is not to try to kill anything. I want to know that if you're including something like Rósa McGowan's claim, then we can defend that. REBECCA: Of course. Please. I know you'll be investigating with due diligence. -Lanny... -Mm-hmm? ...you'll have every chance to respond. Oh. Uh... And I trust it's okay to record this? Oh, of course. Sure. I don't expect you to name sources, but if it's possible for you to let me know overall what your story's about? We're looking into problematic behavior towards women by Weinstein. Okay. (inhales deeply) Harvey adamantly denies any allegation of rape or assault. Nothing criminal. But he is aware of complaints about his treatment of women, and he is working on that. Powerful men of an older generation are changing their understanding of the meaning of the word "consensual." Why women don't feel it's consensual even if a man convinces himself it is. Do you want to expand on that? Uh, I believe (chuckles) there's a story to be told about the evolution of men. And, in particular, Harvey on this subject. Uh, would he be willing to talk to us about it? On the record. He has to deal with his wife and children before anything else. You're adamant Rose McGowan's rape accusation is false. Why is that? Did she tell anybody right away? Did she show any signs of distress? She told her manager and a lawyer. Harvey was aware that there was a problem with Rose, but not that she was accusing him of rape. So I draw a bright line on the word "rape." Anything below that line, uh, he was aware of feelings, concerns. Of what kind? I'm sorry. What... If the concerns were not about rape, what were they about? The only way I can answer is, um... ...a sense of exploitation because of that disparate power relationship. There's mental coercion that isn't physical coercion. Lisa Bloom has been working with Harvey to help him recognize the difference. Lisa Bloom? Yeah. MEGAN: If Harvey had been made aware of McGowan's concerns at the time, how did he respond? I think he had dealings legally with her about them. And how would you characterize those legal dealings? I think he became aware that she did not regard what happened as okay with her. I'm not talking about rape. I'm talking about the effect he had on Rose McGowan. And that rather than fighting... "Rather than fighting"? Then... then what? I-I think he has agreed to settlements rather than litigating what might have been litigated. As Harvey saw it, it was better to settle, even if you haven't done anything wrong. He preferred to settle. Were there other cases of questionable intimate relations with women in which Weinstein settled? Let's say for now, even on a background basis, that I need to find out what my limits are legally. Even if on background, I'm confirming settlements. But the-the answer is yes, there have been. How many? (softly): No. (Lanny chuckles) To admit to settlements this early, they're in real trouble. -We need to find out a number. -(Megan chuckles) We need to corroborate each one. -I'm on it. -(phone vibrating) Have you guys had any dealings with Diana Filip? -No. -I said no to speaking at a women's conference. -She just keeps on calling me. -Did you have her checked out? Security consultant says she's legit, but who has time for these random people? (phone vibrating) Hello? WOMAN (over phone): I worked at Miramax. Talk to Irwin Reiter. He hates Weinstein. (line clicks) (phone vibrating) Hey. Are you okay? JODI (over phone): Did I wake you? Um, yeah. What's up? JODI: What do you know about Irwin Reiter? Hang on. I put together a file on him. I need to write a good fucking email. Hi. Thanks for meeting me. You want to get me killed? So, Irwin, you've been an accountant for the Weinsteins for 30 years. (pours drink) I pick up the check, and I reserve the right to leave after five minutes. (clears throat) So, um... what do you want to know? We have information on several settlements that Weinstein made in the '90s, paid to actresses and ex-employees. Could you tell me anything about that? Could you confirm those settlements and how it was from your perspective? My perspective? Would it be company money that was used? You wrote that we're from the same tiny world. Yeah. Summers at bungalows in the Catskills. Meals at Lefty's and Pop-Ins. What do you remember about those holidays? Gosh, I remember so many things. It's the first time I remember seeing my grandmother's arms bare. I knew those tattoos meant something seismic. Yeah, h-how did you know? I just sensed it. Did your family discuss it? Who else are you talking to? I can't disclose that, Irwin. You know, my parents, uh, they couldn't go there. They rarely discussed it. It's so mysterious, isn't it? Why some families talk. Some don't. The money Weinstein was spending was, you know, crazy. I tried. I tried many times to get the board to do something about him, but they just kept ignoring his behavior and keeping him on. Why is that? Have you talked to L.O.C.? Or, uh, Z.P.? Who is L.O.C.? There was this memo. Let me ask you something, Jodi, that's really puzzling me. Why are you asking about the '90s when Weinstein has committed so many more recent offenses? I got to go. -I'll give you a call. -Irwin. ♪ ♪ (breathes deeply) (door opens) (crying): Mom.

It would just be great for background to know a number of the other settlements that you're aware of. -I'm not a bad guy here. -I know that. My profession is to get the facts into the hands of reporters, but... (laughs): you know, I can't help. I keep getting 40 in my head. (sighs) Which would be ridiculous, right? Right?

We heard that Ronan Farrow is working on a story. No, no. That is done. Over. I don't see you as a bad guy, Lanny. I-I don't. I never have. I respect you. Uh, I respect you. (sighs) This is all gonna come out, Lanny. Publicly. Generally does. (chuckles) -(laughs): Okay. -(laughing) Wh... What am I laughing about? (both laugh) (sighs): Oh, Megan. Lanny. I'd say eight to 12 settlements. (sighs softly) And do you think that's normal? For men to make so many payoffs? I do. Yeah. It feels like we're so close. Do you think we'll get it? What if we don't? I'm having nightmares about him. -Oh, my God. I have them, too. -Yeah? I'm terrified we know all this and we might go to our graves knowing it. The story will run. My worry is people won't care. And he won't even be slowed down, let alone stopped. It's like an ocean of wrongdoing. I mean, can you imagine how many Harveys there are out there, every day? I sometimes wonder... ...when I had Mira, if... ...if all the trauma, not just in me but in... but in all w-women I talked to, if it just... this darkness, this constant violence, if it just sort of imploded.

(smacks lips) It was, uh, from an ex-executive, and it was extensive, scathing. She sent it to the board. When was this? How did they react? Oh, it was a short burst of behind-doors mayhem, and then she left. What did her memo say? That the company was a toxic environment. Would anyone have a copy?

Can you tell me anything about what happened in Venice? This is off the record, yeah? I had the evening shifts, going through notes on screenplays with Harvey. One night, we were working, and he kept trying to touch me. I didn't want to make him angry. He's a very big man. I kept trying to get back to the notes. And that went on for a few hours, just trying to avoid him. How did you do that? I would just fight him off. I'd worn two pairs of tights to buy me some time if I ever needed it. But finally, he held me down. Not forcefully, but like it was a game. (stammers softly) Then he parted my legs, and he said... "Please, just one thrust, and it'll all be over." I got away. I was traumatized. I was a Christian. I was still with my first boyfriend. And you shared this with Zelda? Zelda was completely enraged and very brave in facing him. We both resigned. (inhales deeply) But I couldn't get a new job after leaving Miramax. (sighs) Everyone kept saying, if I worked for Harvey, why would I leave? The NDA that we signed, it stipulated that if I ever had trouble getting a job in film again, I was to go back to Harvey or his lawyer Hutensky for help. I asked them for a reference, and Hutensky, he kept repeating... (sighs) What? What was he saying? How much Harvey valued me. We agreed I would return to Miramax under strict conditions.

I am a 28-year-old woman trying to make a living and a career. I am a professional. I am sexualized and diminished. I have been fearful about speaking up, but remaining silent is causing me great distress. He told me, "I'm a bad boy, but what's important is that I'm honest about it." He said the only thing I was good for was making babies. An assistant told me Harvey made her give him a massage while he was naked. It was horrible to see her so upset. When I complained to their human resources executive, the response was, "Let us know if he hits you or crosses a line physically." Harvey Weinstein is a 64-year-old world-famous man, and this is his company. The balance of power is me zero, Harvey Weinstein ten. Go write. MATT: You've got the story. Once we publish, everything else will come out. And talk to Lauren O'Connor. -Yeah. -DEAN: Get ahold of the Weinstein Company board for their response. Let me call Lance Maerov. Write it. Let's get ready. NICOLE: My client does not want to be named. That memo was never for public distribution. REBECCA: Lauren? NICOLE: My client is here, but she's too upset to speak. REBECCA: Lauren, I'm sorry this is difficult for you. We're not gonna publish the whole memo. And we will make it absolutely clear you were not the source and that you declined to comment. But we do intend to use your name for its credibility. If you were a victim of sexual assault, we would absolutely keep your anonymity. But as a witness to what went on, it would make this story much stronger to name you. Hi, Lance. This is Megan Twohey from The New York Times. We have a memo here from Lauren O'Connor to The Weinstein Company. -What? Sh... -MEGAN: We want to know, -what did you do about it? -Shit. What did the board do about it? (breathing heavily) Lance? We did try to change things with the police complaint in 2015. What about this memo? It was there and then it was gone? Look, we were all worried about Harvey's behavior. Can I quote you, Lance? Yes. Yes, you can. So, Lauren's complaint? It was withdrawn days after it was sent. So, yeah, I let it go. Well, why do you think it was withdrawn? I really don't know why. Look, are you sure that this isn't just young women who want to sleep with a movie producer to try to get ahead? We have decades of allegations, accusations of harassment, assault, rape and multiple settlements. I know you're gonna need to speak to the board, but could you wait until after the weekend? Is that possible? (clears throat) Okay. Ashley, I know that ideally a lot of women would be jumping together, but that's not what's happening. But we do have a series of incidents and a predatory pattern. You would be coming forward alone, but you would be standing on a mountain of evidence. Ashley? ASHLEY: Yes. I'll think about it very seriously, Jodi. I promise. Thank you, Ashley. (line clicks) DEAN: We go with what we have. I know we need to be mindful of The New Yorker, but couldn't we wait just a little longer, just-just for these women to commit? No. We need to publish. It's nothing like the whole story. This can be the first arrow. More women will come forward afterwards. It could be so much stronger, Dean. It's solid. We need to go. How much time will we give Weinstein to respond? -24 hours? -I'd double it. 48 hours. -That's fair. -DEAN: Two days? How many people could Harvey and his team talk to in that amount of time? David? I'd go with Rebecca. We want to be irreproachable from the legal side. DEAN: Good. Let's call Lanny. We'll ask to speak to Harvey and his team at 1:00 tomorrow.
