[music playing] MAN (ON PA): Lockdown tonight has been delayed one half hour to 9:00 for Cell Block C. C Block innmates will have dinner one half hour earlier at 8:00. Mr. Jacobs, call Central, please. Officer Jacobs, call Central. The lockdown tonight will be delayed. Three years in this dump. I can hardly remember the last time I played the sax. [sax music playing] Ah! Thank you. That's all for tonight, folks. Hope you had a good time. Drive safe. Good night. Richardson. [beeping] Mr. McElroy, I do hope you're not going to give me any bad news. You know how much it upsets Mr. Fisher. Don't worry. Tell Fisher I have the merchandise. Good. And the other business, the gal? Yeah, well, our friend in Oakland couldn't take care of the leading lady. This is very disheartening, Mr. McElroy, but we'll deal with that later. Right now, we're waiting for you and the merchandise. You have 30 minutes. There's one small problem. I'll have to call you back. Oh, he's hung up. What do you think? Oh, God. It was beautiful. - I'm glad you liked it. I wouldn't want you to endorse something you didn't believe in. "Endorse?" It's called "Lisa's Dreams." Oh, baby! Mwah! Mwah. [inaudible] I'll be back in a minute. I just gotta change. Bye. OK. So when do I get one of those? Honey, they don't make 'em like that anymore. Great, thanks. Sax-man. Mackie, I don't believe it. I remember when that thing was bigger than you. Upon a time, it was. Hey! It's been a long time. How the hell are you? I'm good. You're looking at one of the busiest real estate brokers in the Bay Area. If you're so busy, what are you doing in LA? Hey, I came to catch your act. Shit Bullshit. You haven't seen me play for years. Yeah, right. Mike, I got about 30 minutes to make a very important business meeting. This guy's a real stickler for time. Anyway, it turns out I meet this girl on the way down here. This chick is a real lush. We must have hit every bar on the coast. Right now, she's in the back of my car, totally crocked. I can't pitch up at the meeting with this chick. Can you give me a ride? Sure, but what about the girl? Hey, she's outlived her usefulness to me. Now I remember what it was about you I didn't like. OK, you ready to go? Yeah, just let me get a ride home for my girlfriend. MACKIE: Your girlfriend? Anyone I know? No, thank God. Well, you know what they say. Once they've had Mack, they never can go back. I gotta make a call. Sweetheart, an old buddy stopped by tonight. I gotta give him a ride somewhere. Now? I couldn't get out of it. OK. Could you give her a ride home? I would hurry up if I were you, Mackie. Let's not upset Mr. Fisher. Richardson? Richardson! Everything OK? Yeah, fine. Who's Richardson? Oh, he's a pain in the ass. Let's go. Sir? So I'm sick of his fuckups. It's about time we got-- it's about time we got rid of Mr. McElroy. I just gotta get some stuff out of my car. Looks like the car. Fuck, man. Mackie, you're not gonna leave her like that. Come on, man. As soon as I take care of business, I'll come back for her, OK? So where are we headed? Down Malibu. God, this is so beautiful. I remember I did some of my best fucking in these hills here. Yeah, I got a good chance at a record contract. If it comes through, Lisa and I are getting a house, right here. [unzips] [deeply sniffs] I think we got a homicide. You secure the crime scene. I'm going after the car. [siren wailing] Control, this is [inaudible] 4. I'm in pursuit. 187. Suspects heading westbound for [inaudible] Canyon of a white, late model Mustang. Mike, I gotta take a leak. Pull over. [radio chatter] 10-4, control. OK. [siren wailing] The suspect's vehicle [inaudible].. Fuck! It's the cops, man! Fuck it, drive! Come on! Mackie, what are you doing? Come on, move it! This is crazy. Shut the fuck up, Michael, and just drive. What the hell's going on? Come on! Fucking drive, man! Come on! Who's in command at the road block? CONTROL: Detective Marsh. I'm patching you through to him. Stand by. - Roger. - Marsh here. Go ahead. Over. OFFICER (ON RADIO): Are you ready to intercept? Yeah, ready and waiting. What the fuck was that? I knew it, man. I'd lay it 8-1 it's that asshole. Richardson. Well, I think we should get the fuck out of here. Start the bloody car. Come on, move! Let's go, man, faster! Control, be advised. We're almost at the road block. Come on, put the gun down, Mackie! Shut the fuck up Michael. - ETA is 20 seconds. - Come on, Mackie. This is nuts! Come on! Shut the fuck up! Michael, I'll blow your fucking head off. 10 seconds, Control. Move it! He's no stopping! Get off the road! [gunfire] Hands on the wheel! JUDGE: In consideration of your clean record, I sentence you, Michael Keller, to five years in state prison with the possibility of parole in three years. Take him away. Looks like you're history, killer. You're out of here. Let's go. OK, let's see. Michael Keller, number 3724891. Manslaughter, huh? A cop. Well, well. Who'd you suck off to get out early? Your mother. Hey, just cool it. Let's get him out of here, all right? You better hope I never see you on the outside. Hear me, cop killer? You know, this is really funny. I-- I thought I had so much that I wanted to say to you, but I can't seem to think of anything. You don't know how hard it's been for me, not being able to see you the past few years. I mean, not that I didn't understand your reasons for making me stay away. Because I did. It was just hard, you know? Michael. Michael, please talk to me. - What do you want me to say? - I don't know. Say anything. Say whatever you want. Just talk to me! You want me tell you how wonderful it was living in Disneyland? Shall I tell you about that? Sorry. I didn't mean to press you. But I understand. You can't understand. You're wrong, Michael. I do understand! I understand your pain completely, because I've had to live with that same pain. It's like every day I've been in prison just like you. Now we're free. We're free to start over. Michael, for both of us. That is, if you still want me. [badly playing saxophone] [playing saxophone] You know, when I saw you, all those old feelings started pouring back into me. Guess all this time I've been setting myself up to play the victim. That's why I stopped you from coming to see me. But when I was walking around, I realized the only way that's going to happen is if I let it. I have a choice to be whatever I allow myself to be. And I choose to be happy. And the only way I'm happy is when I'm with you. That's very good. Police, open up. Everybody stay where you are. Get dressed. I got some people downtown who wanna see the show too. Read 'em their rights. Why don't you pigs mind your own business? We're only giving the people what they want! Tyrone, Tyrone. I've been wanting your ass for a long time. He's going to love this. I hope so. Now, look, guys. If you could play that way tonight, [laughter] I'd be a happy man. That sounds real good. Hey. I don't believe my eyes! If it ain't the real sax-man in the flesh. Wow. How you doing, Mike? Fine. How are you doing, Frank? [inaudible] Hey, guys. I want you to meet one of the hottest sax players in this town, Mike Keller. Hi, Mike. How are you, guys? Hey, Mike. I heard about your misfortune. Must've been a real drag, eh? Yeah, it was a bad deal. Listen, Frank, I need a gig. Could you use me? Absolutely, man. Wow. And how's the chops holding up? Better than ever. You want me to prove it to you? Hey, you don't have to audition for me, man. I know your word. God knows we've played enough gigs together. Yeah. I'll tell you what to do. Be here tonight about 10:00. Then we'll give it a go. Everything goes well, I'll speak money with management, OK? I appreciate it. A friend of ours has been waiting a long time for you to hit the streets again, pal. He wants you to know he just hasn't forgotten how bad you and Mackie fucked up. He wants his money back. What the fuck are you talking about? I don't know anything about any money! I told you he was gonna need some coaxing. Let me have him for two minutes. I'll help his memory. No, that won't be necessary. You better watch my partner, pal. He's fucking crazy. Right! So do yourself a favor, huh? No more games. Otherwise, next time, I might not be able to hold him back. Look, our friend, he's a businessman. When he lays out half a million for something, he expects delivery. When he don't get what he expects, it's only natural he should want his money back. But to show you he's not completely unreasonable, you have 48 hours to come up with the bread. OK? We'll be in touch real soon. Give him the tape. For your viewing pleasure. Goes great with popcorn. Enjoy the show. MAN (ON TAPE): By now, I'm sure you've got a good understanding of the situation. Oh my God. MAN (ON TAPE): So I see no need to go on about it. It's simple. You give us the money, and we'll give you your girlfriend, Lisa. What money? MAN (ON TAPE): So be smart. Don't fuck with me. Because if you do, you're gonna force me to make your girlfriend into a moving picture star. Shit! MACKIE: I just gotta get some stuff out of my car. MIKE: What the hell was in the briefcase? Money? No, he was carrying porno flicks. [gunfire] Where the hell could a half million dollars go? REPORTER: Early today, Detective Marsh led officers of the LAPD in the apprehension of long suspected pornographers operating from this 29th Street motel. Detective Marsh, was the raid the success you had hoped? Yes, we've made some important arrests, and we're hoping they'll lead to further information and more arrests. REPORTER: Does that mean the ringleaders were not among those who were apprehended today? Well, we have Tyrone Richardson in custody, but we're considering the possibility that Richardson may be part of a bigger outfit. REPORTER: In the meantime, Tyrone Richardson and company are in custody. And channel 3 News will be watching that story closely. From South Central Los Angeles, I'm Sheila Hall. MACKIE: Richardson! Everything OK? Yeah, fine. Who's Richardson? Oh, he's a pain in the ass. SONG: I was trying to live my life alone, refusing to believe that love could make me whole. Still, it seems no matter how I hide, something in my heart won't be denied. It's the lonely love that turns the world this way, changing night to day when I lose my way. It's the lonely love takes away the pain and brings me home again. It's the only love. Mike, I gotta take a leak. Pull over. OFFICER: Guess who made bail this morning. Richardson. Already, huh? Yeah, he's being processed right now. Any instructions? I think his boss got the message. Next time I speak, maybe he'll listen. Put Stoke and Haber on the watch. They know the routine. Got it. Does that feel familiar, you rat's ass? You tell your boss I got his money, but he's gonna have to play the game my way. What's his name? Fuck off. I said, what's his name? Fisher, Jack Fisher! You give this to Jack, and you tell him what I said. You got it? I got it. So where is he? Hey, this is where the note says to meet him, all right? Sir! Thank you very much. That's for you. I see your boyfriend has a sense of humor. It seems like you and I will be taking a little ride. You two stay behind. Richardson? Well, surprise, surprise. I knew your boss wouldn't have the balls to come see me himself. Well, he's a very busy man. Get moving there. I assume you have the money? Well, then, there's no problem. No! No! No, stop it! [screaming] [knocking on door] Sergeant Philip Keller, US MC. I'm Michael, Phil's baby brother. Sure you are. What the fuck happened to you? I need some help. Well, get your ass in here, boy. On the double! So is it OK if Jennifer comes over tonight? No. No, it is not OK. I am sick of that bitch hanging around here. The answer is no. Why? What's she ever done to you? Because I said no! Marissa, you are beginning to piss me off. Why don't you go shopping? But I just got back from shopping! Then just go, will you? I need a break. Will you just go? Do you understand that? Go. - All right. But we're going to Maxwell's tonight, right? I can't tonight. Something just came up. I need to work. Aw, Jack, you promised you'd take me out. How am I ever gonna show off all those beautiful clothes you 'buy me if you never take me anywhere? What, are you deaf or something? Look, take Jennifer, will you? Just-- will you just-- I don't give a fuck. Just go. Jackie. You're so Jackie Jackie, Jackie. Yeah. Well, you take this. And you just go. You're so good to me. I'll never ever leave you. - You're welcome. You what? No. Nobody ever leaves Jack Fisher, baby. No. Yes. [beeping] Do you know what this is? Do yo? It's your death warrant. [unzips] Isn't that [inaudible] Apparently, your boyfriend didn't give a shit whether you lived or died. And now he's dead. I'm stuck with you, aren't I? Agh! Do you like movies? I hope you do. Because I got a new one the other day. I would like your opinion on it. We can watch it together. And then we can get to know each other. [sobbing] [screaming] [laughter] Harry, if anything happens to her, I don't know what I'll do. Well, don't you worry about that. We'll take care of that. Well, you know, I don't think there's a day goes by I don't think about your brother. We were real close, you know? I mean, I can honestly say I think he's about the only real friend I ever had. You were in every one of his letters. Man, he used to crack me up, you know. We were almost on that plane home. Four more miles. Four more stinking miles is all I had left on this tour. I had this crazy notion that I wanted to drive, you know? And-- as I-- you know, I really don't wanna talk about this shit. I really don't. Besides, we got some business to take care of, anyway. Well, this looks like a good spot. For what? For finding out what these guys are up to. Then I'm going. No, you're not. If we both get caught, where does that leave Lisa? What if something happens? No buts! If we're gonna do this thing, we're gonna do it right. Now, I understand you're worried, but you've got to trust me, OK? I know what I'm doing. OK. All right. [inaudible] It's a really great [inaudible] downstairs. Give me a lift. Be careful. Always am. Well, almost always. What you reading, Einstein? I've told you before, Willie, not to call me that. Oh, so sorry! [chuckling] If your nose wasn't always stuck in a book, it might have saved you a night in jail. [chuckling] I think now would be an appropriate time to warn you of my mood, William. - Oh, look at me. I'm shaking. Willie, just cool it. No, I'm getting tired of taking orders from this Oxford faggot. All he ever does is fuck up! Hey. What am I running here? A day nursery, you fucking idiots, huh? Huh? Big John, go get the car. I've got some unfinished business for him to sign. And you two, you two stay here and watch the girl. Don't mess up. Did you see her? She's up there, all right. Where are you going? I'm going to get her out of here! No, you're not! What are you, crazy? You think these guys are messing around, huh? Do you? You think this is some kind of game? Gonna be dark soon. So why don't we go back to the shop and think this thing over? You're sure you don't wanna go to the police? I'm not going to the police! I'm gonna this by myself. OK, Michael. OK. Hey, Chuck. Where's my sandwich? I'm starving here? CHUCK: Relax, Willie. It's coming. WILLIAM: Yeah, when, next week? MARSH (ON RADIO): 1 Mary 12. This is Marsh. Do you read. Over? Here we go. You deal with him, Stokey. He makes me nervous. Pussy. Mary 12 here. Over. MARSH (ON RADIO): How's it going over there? Yeah, everything's quiet, sir. MARSH (ON RADIO): Well, I hope you packed a lunch, because you're gonna be there for a while. How long is "a while?" Until I say so. That's how long! Something's going on over there, and I wanna know what it is! I shouldn't have to remind you of what the consequences will be if anything goes wrong with this project. One slip-up. and we all go down. And if that happens, I will rip your heart out. That goes for your partner too. Do you read me, Detective Stoke? Yeah, I read you. It's starting to get a little out of hand, wouldn't you say? [knocking on door] [groaning] Help me, help me, help me! What the hell happened? Help! Don't even think about it. Should have worn your bib, Clyde. Turn around. What the fuck is this? Where is she? Where's who? You've got five seconds to tell me where she's at. It's behind those mirrors. How do I get in? Getting There's a code number he punches into the phone, but I don't know what it is! I swear to God, I don't know what it is! You girls having fun? Fuck you! You two all right in there? Yeah. Watch out, Harry! Harry. Get out of here. Get the hell out of here! I don't like this. Something's wrong. Yeah, who the hell are those guys? I don't know. Better check this out. This is the key to the house out back. OK, now what? You wait here. I'm gonna make a phone call. This whole scene is starting to get fucked up. Yes? It's me. I have to speak to Fisher right now. Fisher, the girl escaped. She's with her boyfriend. Marsh doesn't know anything yet. Forget about your boss. You get those two back for me, and I'll make it more than worth your while. Do you understand what I'm trying to say? Yes. FISHER (ON PHONE): Good. That's very good. Will you make me a line? [sobbing] Must be one of Fisher's men. God! Listen to me. Honey, you've got to get a hold of yourself. I'll call Harry. [phone ringing] Yeah. Now, listen, just calm down. Are you two all right? All right, now listen to me. I got a small cabin up at Turtle Creek. It's about four hours north of the city. I'll meet you out back. And just be careful. 1 Mary 12, this is Marsh. Over. 1 Mary 12, this is Marsh. Come in. Over. 1 Mary 12, come in. Over. Where are those clowns? Fisher, it happened so fast! [moaning] [sobbing] Oh, oh. Marissa. I swear I shall go shopping for those bastards for you. Oh, fuck. If they had any hopes of calling the police, they can't now. Not with a dead policeman on their hands. The logical assumption would be that they're seeking a place to hide. The question is, where? The answer to that question is sitting over there. When he tells me what I want to know, I'm gonna cut his balls off. I think that would be unwise at this time, Jack. Not only could he be useful in helping us locate Mr. Keller and his friends, but he might make an excellent decoy when comes the time for us to learn the nature of their defenses. Mr. Keller has proven himself quite resourceful. And I'd hate to see any of your men, myself included, get hurt needlessly. Yeah. Yeah, you could be right. You call Lou. And you tell Lou that he owes me a favor. And you tell him that I want four of his best men, now. It's time that our Detective Haber showed us want we want to know. Isn't it, soldier? Yeah, right. There was something you wanted to tell me? Oh, yeah. We still haven't been able to contact Stoke and Haber. Any suggestions? Well, let's aggravate Fisher, and see if he can help us out. Look, you tear this place apart. I want some answers. How you doing, Sammy? Fill it up, would you? [music playing] Harry. How you doing, Mel? What the hell are you doing here this time of year? Bass don't run for another two months. You know that. I know. I just had to get out of the city for a while. Yeah. Mind ringing this up for me? Sure. Let's see. Well, fill 'em up. Oh, God. Sick son of a bitch! Put out an APB now. I want this animal. Yes, sir. Tom, there's something wrong. How do you mean? I don't know. You just seemed preoccupied. That's all. What's bugging you? - Oh, I don't know. I don't know. I guess it's just tougher to deal with scenes like this. Come on. We got work to do. Thanks, Harry. Man, this place is great. Just the bare essentials. Hey, Harry. - Yeah, Mike. You think he's coming here? Let me tell you something. If that guy was a rat, he'd find food at a Weight Watchers convention. Now, let's get cracking! Come on! What is he up to? I have no idea, but I trust him. Hey, Harry, what's that for? It's kind of oatmeal. It helps the gasoline stick to your ribs. I could really get used to this. I always had something a little bit more tropical in mind. Sounds good. I always kind of fantasized I'd have my own nightclub. Mhm. Nothing too fancy. Just a place where I could play my sax. Maybe a little recording studio next door. Now, wait a minute. Your fantasy's getting awfully expensive now. And then if we had the money-- I mean, if you're gonna dream, dream big. Yeah. Jack, what makes you so sure they went this way? Hurry up with that line, will you? Big John, pull over. Get Lou's men to get rid of the bodies. Tell 'em to tidy up. Jesus, Harry. This place is starting to look like Fort Knox. What are the lights for? The garden party. Yo, hey, hey! Where do you think you're going? First, I'm gonna go to the head. Then I'm gonna get me something to eat. OK? Is that OK with you? Well, you won't mind if I tag along, then, right? Fucking asshole. [giggling] It's pretty wild, what Fisher did to Freddie and Chuck, huh? Guess this city's out one car, huh, Haber? Hope they don't raise my taxes. Yeah. [giggling] That's why I hang with Big John. The man is my idol. He's too smart to get in a position like that. He made me smart too! Now we're just like Kareem Abdul Jabbar and Magic Johnson. [snaps fingers] Hey, let a guy shit in peace, man. We're unstoppable, man! [flushing] Shit. Yeah. Bet that's a load off your mind. You're fucking right, it is. [giggling] [sniffing] Jack, don't you ever get enough of that stuff? Richardson, you're beginning to piss me off. What'll it be, sir? I-- I'm sorry, sir. $5 for you. Your change, sir. Thank you. And what'll it be for you, sir? Hurry up! Yeah, it's good news. We just got a call from a Mel's Trading Post on highway 40 in Morgan. Seems like a guy came into his store 10 minutes ago and hands him a note stating that he is Officer Haber. The note goes on to say that he's being held against his will. From the description of the cars they were driving in, it sounds like it could be Fisher. We're running a plate check right now. Did he say where they're headed? North on 40. Get me a helicopter and some men. We're going up. And get me a fix on the exact location. I'm not gonna stay in there. It's gonna be the safest place in these woods in a short while. Listen, Harry. I appreciate the thought and everything. He's right. Look, I'm not gonna stay in there. I wanna be with you. I wanna help you. You know, it's up to you, of course. But I already got one woman's death on my hands. I really don't want hers too. I promise you, I'm coming back. What are those? These are very special shells, Michael. What are they for? They're gonna help us harvest our garden. Well, now we get to test your theory, Mr. Richardson. Where's Haber? Get me Haber. Haber. Well, my friend, now you prove to me that I didn't make a mistake when I put you and that lame partner of yours on the payroll. Why me? I was just following orders. Yes, don't you think I know that? I know that. It's just, Haber, that there comes are time when, in every man's life, when he's got to start earning the fucking money that I believe that I'm beginning to waste. But I'm just asking you to go up to that house, knock on the door, and you see if anybody's in. And how the fuck am I supposed to do that, Jack? [chuckling] You're a policeman, aren't you? Do what a fucking policeman does! Oh, don't worry. Like a policeman, I'm not gonna ask you to do it alone. Oh no. I'll send somebody with you. They can-- they can hold your little pink hand. Isn't there a better way to do this, Jack? I mean, couldn't we-- I didn't seem to be getting through to you, do I? You see, Haber, I'm not asking you. I'm telling you. You go up there. Or I'm gonna fucking put an end to your career right here and now. Move! You move! [click] Now. Wait, I'm a police officer! Officer Haber, Officer Mann, Officer Ruben. We'd like to speak to you about a man named Fisher. Far enough! May we come in? You can come forward, but those two stay where they are. [gunfire] Help! Help me! Help me! Well, it appears we have underestimate Mr. Keller again. Shut up. Keller, just give us the money, and we'll go! Just like the original deal! Yeah, was rape part of the original deal? Just call that a fringe benefit! No extra charge for that, soldier. I'm sick of playing with those assholes. [gunfire] I'll get the others. Let's go. We've lost. I think we should pull back and regroup. What are doing? Turning chicken, right? I knew you were nothing but a pussy. I'd much rather be alive. [laughter] I'd much rather be alive, wouldn't you? If you wanna regroup, then fucking regroup! Richardson! You think you're smart. but you're not. What? You're not smart. You of all people should know that you can't leave me. Oh, Jack. [gunfire] Does anybody else want to leave? Hm? Jack, Jack. Look, I was thinking. If-- if we could put those lights out, it'll be a little easier for us to get around. Shit! Now what? I don't know, Michael. I guess we think like bats. Something's moving out there. John, look out! Come on, John! No. John, please. Get up! No! Motherfuckers! [yelling] Little prick! Hey, Harry. Do you like the beach? What the fuck are you talking about, Michael? I was just wondering. Ow! Ow! I smell gas. Yeah. Shit, it's on fire! Michael! Whoa! I finally get to meet the great musician. Let her go, Fisher. She's got nothing to do with this! Oh, on the contrary, she has everything to do with this. You see, when I have finished with you, she's gonna be covering for the Marissa. I no longer have. I can get the money. This is-- this is not about money anymore! This-- this-- this is about family. See, you took my family from me. Now you've-- you've got to pay. Hey, dip brain! Lisa, come on! Michael! Down there! [screaming] It's the last body, sir. Is there anything else you want us to do before we go? Tom? Huh? What did you say? Is there anything you want us to check on before we leave? No, I guess not. [coughing] Aw man, I sure used to love this fucking place. [laughter] Here we are. Thank God. How about some breakfast? How about some fried eggs? What do you think? [laughter] Sounds great. Oh, God. Oh, Harry. So much for "home sweet home," huh? And what is this? It's called "money." How's the Caribbean sound? Great. Michael! Are you serious? Remember that boat we talked about? Yeah. We're getting it. Hey, this is Fisher's money. We earned it. It's our money. Wrong. It's my money. Ah, who the hell is this? Hand it over. Chief Detective Thomas Marsh. You forgot to add, formerly of the LAPD. Thanks to you, this money is my ticket out. I can just see the headlines now. Chief of detectives linked to gangland figure in graft probe. Not to mention accomplice to how many murders, huh? Ah, yes, yes. Well, unfortunately, money rather than duty calls. After all, this is America, is it not? Yeah, now you know why they call 'em "pigs." You, pass me that money. Easy now, cowboy. Nice and easy. That's very funny. Well, it was nice meeting you. Harry! MICHAEL (VOICEOVER): Well, I knew it would take a miracle to bring Harry back. And that's just what happened. You know the old saying, "old soldiers never die. They just go to the dogs." On the beach, that is. Who says revenge isn't sweet? [chuckling] SONG: I was trying to live my life alone. Refusing to believe that love could make me whole. Still, it seems no matter how I hide, there's something in my heart won't be denied. It's the lonely love that turns the world this way. Changing night to day when I lose my way. It's the lonely love that takes away the pain and brings me home again. It's the only love. It's the lonely love that turns the world this way. Changing night to day when I lose my way. It's the lonely love that breaks away the pain and brings me home again. It's the only love.
