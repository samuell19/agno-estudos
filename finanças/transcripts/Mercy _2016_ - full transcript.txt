[instrumental music playing] [car door closes] Who are you? Mr. Mitchell? Yeah. What do you want? We spoke on the phone several times. I'm Dr. Turner. Yeah. Well... nothing's changed. I'm very sorry to hear that. That's it, then. It doesn't have to be this way. Listen, you have no right to get involved. My wife is dying and she-- Your wife is suffering. It's within your power to stop that. You're not coming in. Do it yourself, then. -Any of you. -I told you before-- I've included instructions on how to operate it. We're not interested. -What about the rest of your family? -They're not either. We're talking about your wife here, Mr. Mitchell. -How can you not be interested? -[sighs] You have a safe and effective option available. Use it. [sighs] Get off my property. [lock clicks] [country music playing over car radio] [cell phone ringing] [volume lowers] [music continues playing softly] Hello. Yeah, what? [stutters] I know. You'll get your money. I need a week. [music playing loudly] [EKG beeping] [engine stops] [keys jangling] [sniffles] [EKG beeping] Here. I'll give you some time alone with your mother. [T.J. sighs] What's that doing there, Pop? That doctor came by earlier. -The one who's been calling? -Yep. [T.J. clears throat] [stutters] Why'd he give it to you, Pop? Said we could do it ourselves, any one of us. What about Brad and Travis? What about them? They want their cut, too. You really wanna have that conversation now? No. Yeah. Yeah, I do, actually. Use your fucking head, Ronnie, will you? Hey, I am using my fucking head. -What's the matter with you-- -No, no! You're not. [sniffles] [sighs] Your mother got a lot of money when Travis and Brad's father died. A lot. Yeah, Pop. We know. -That's why we're here with-- -Shut up. Shut up. Now, that money has been locked up in a separate account for years. And I made it so that when she passes, that money goes to me. That means... that when my time comes, by law, that money will all go to you two. [Ronnie] What are you... [grunts] [chuckles] [stutters] Yeah, I don't know what you... Fuck. What are you talking about, Pop? -"When your time comes"? -Yeah, that's right. Not to that degenerate outside, not to his asshole brother. But if you keep running your mouth about inheritances and whatever else, they might just change their minds about all this. And if that's what ends up happening... well, I hope you know a good lawyer. -[T.J.] You think it still runs? -[Ronnie sighs] [sniffles] Don't know. I'd take it with me if I had time to ride it, but I'm busy working all the goddamn time. [T.J.] Then maybe you should sell it. [clears throat] Hopefully, after all this, I won't have to. -Now... -Well, then don't. -...can you settle? -I'm settled. What do you... -Stop fiddling with everything in this... -I'm not... [Ronnie] Hey. Hey. [Ronnie] When'd you get out? [sighs] Couple weeks ago. What was it this time? B and E? -Assault. -Hmm. [Ronnie scoffing] You okay? I don't know, T.J., are you? What are you doing for work? Things. [Ronnie] Oh, yeah? What kind of things? [Travis sighs] What do you care, Ronnie? Well, me and T.J. just talked to Dad. [Travis] Your dad, not mine. Whatever. He's holding all the cards, you know. -Especially yours. -[T.J.] Ronnie. [Ronnie] No, no, he should... he should hear this. He's, uh... He's... he's cutting you out. You and Brad. -[T.J.] What are you doing, Ronnie? -Shut up. Shut up. Why are you telling me this, Ronnie? Because you're my brother. So, yeah. Those things you're doing... hopefully they pay good. [sniffles] [cell phone buzzing] You can take that. It's just work. That part I don't miss. [Brad breathes deeply] [Melissa] I'm sorry to ask this, but... we're gonna be okay after this, right? Yeah. [engine stops] [T.J. talking indistinctly] Yes. I hear you. Right. Okay, I... I'm telling you, I'll pay you next week. [stuttering] I can... All right. Okay. [stutters] I gotta go. Bye. This is Melissa. Hi. Hi. These are my brothers. T.J., Ronnie. Half-brothers. Um, Brad's told me a lot about both of you. He shouldn't have told you anything. [sighs] Who's this? She's a friend. Do you understand what's going on here? I'm just here to help Brad through this. This is none of your business. Where's, uh... where's Travis? [EKG beeping] [Grace whispers] Travis. [footsteps approaching] [Brad sniffles] [Travis clears throat] [Brad exhales heavily and sniffles] [footsteps receding] [sighs] [exhales heavily] [softly] Brad. This is Melissa. [groans] I found this up in the attic last week. It's your mother's old diary. But before we get to that, let's get something else out of the way. Because I know you all saw the bag. You all know what's in it and you all know what it will do. [sighs] But being able to do it ourselves doesn't change a goddamn thing and that's that. "June 10th, 1982. I'm trying to move on, day by day. The church has been so supportive, but I'm still struggling. I know it's horrible to say, but Bradley's death was like a gift. I certainly prayed for an accident like that enough times. And now, as I'm struggling to move on, I'm being told that I have to decide what to do with his remains. Whenever my time comes, and that decision has to be made for me, I can only hope it's made by someone who cares about me. And not by someone who's glad I'm dead." So... we should discuss her arrangements for once this is over. Well, I'm not ready to think that far ahead yet. The hell does that mean? Okay, I don't know what you two are trying to pull... but whatever it is, it ain't gonna work. No one's trying to pull anything, Ronnie. Maybe he just cares about his mother. Well, maybe you should shut up and mind your fucking business. How about you fucking try that for a fucking change. [Brad] Shut up, Ronnie! [Melissa] Hey, hey, hey! [T.J.] Ronnie, come on. [Melissa] Get off of him! [George] Knock it off! [Melissa] Hey! Hey, stop, stop! -Stop. Stop. -[T.J.] All right, back up. Back up. Okay. This ain't gonna end good for you. You either. And you. You, whatever you think's going on here, you're wrong. What are you doing? [Travis] Nothing, man. Just looking around. I remember that. Mom and her religion. Hocus-pocus bullshit. She always thought I stole the missing piece. She never said it, but I know she thought it. Man, you don't know that. Yeah, well, I wasn't you. [sighs] You made your own choices, Travis. Yeah. I know I did, Brad. I still do. I accept who I am. What, and I don't? You say you're not ready to think that far ahead yet? That's fine. I mean, it's bullshit. But it's fine. But don't pretend that actually makes you any better than the rest of us in all this. It doesn't. It makes you worse. I'm gonna, uh, set the alarm for 7:15. Whatever you want. [clears throat] [Brad exhales heavily] I'm sorry about all that stuff earlier by the fire. [Melissa] There's... there's something I need to ask you. [sniffles] What did Ronnie mean when he said that I don't know what's really going on? [Brad] I'm sorry, I should have told you this. [Melissa] So, tell me. [Brad] Her pain. My mother's pain... there's a way to make it go away. [Melissa] Is that what's in the black bag? [Brad sighs] Yes. Then why wouldn't you? [chuckles] It's not that simple. [Melissa] But if the end result is the same, why would you let her suffer? Good night. [EKG beeping] [Ronnie] We should replace the truck, too. Thing's a piece of shit. Oh, it's not the truck, it's the economy. [Ronnie sighs] Okay, how'd it go at the bank? Not good. [clears throat] [Ronnie] Okay, what about the other place? The credit union? Well, no. That's not gonna happen there either. Nobody's giving out any loans. Well, we gotta do what we gotta do, then. [T.J.] Oh, man. What? It's Mom's wedding photo. From her church. I've never seen Brad Sr. before. Me neither. Did you know anything about him? Only that he used to beat the shit outta Mom. -Explains why Mom wanted him gone. -[sighs] Explains a lot of things. -We gotta do what we gotta do, T.J. -[sighs] [EKG beeping] -[man grunts] -[clattering] [footsteps thudding lightly] [floor creaks] [lock clicks] -[whispering] Travis. -[Travis] What? -Travis, wake up. -What? -I need you to put your shoes on. -What's wrong? I don't know. Maybe nothing. Just put your shoes on. -[sighs] What's going on? -Shh, shh. Listen, I'm not sure. -I woke up, right? -[sniffles] I came down here and the TV was on. -That's why you woke me up? -No, no, no. No. I think someone was in the house. The side door was wide open. Travis. [Travis] Weather didn't do that. [Brad] How do you know? [Travis] The barn light's on. [clattering] [Travis breathes heavily] Listen. Listen, listen. You go check and see where Ronnie and T.J. are. I'll go look at the breaker. [clattering] [clunking] [clattering] [footsteps thudding] [Brad] Jesus! [breathing heavily] Our tires are slashed. -Where are Ronnie and T.J.? -I don't know. -What do you mean you don't know? -I mean I don't fucking know. They weren't in their beds. You think that they slashed the tires? This is crazy. -[Melissa screams] -[Brad] Melissa! [Melissa shrieks] [panting] Melissa! [EKG beeping] [breathing heavily] -[leaves rustle] -[gasps] Who's there? Brad! Brad, where are you? [Melissa] Help me! Help me! Help me! [Brad] Melissa. What happened? What happened? Talk to me. What happened? Come here. [Melissa breathing shakily] [Brad] Ronnie? [breathing heavily] Hurry. Go. Go. Go. Run! [Travis] Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Hurry! -Let's go. Go. Go. Go. -[Brad] Go. Run! [Travis] Come on. Come on. [Brad] Go. Go. -[Travis] Oh, shit! -Come here. Come on. [Brad] Go, go, go. Go, go, go. [banging on door] [Travis] Grab the table. Hey! Come on. [Travis] Let's go. [Brad] Where's Melissa? [Travis] Let's go! Come on! [Brad] You okay? [Melissa] Yeah. I'm okay. [Brad] What's this doing here? [Melissa] I don't know. It was on the bed. [Brad] What happened? [Melissa] T.J. was in the woods. [whimpers] [glass shatters] Get the bureau. [Brad] Come on. [Melissa shrieks] [Melissa breathing heavily] [footsteps thudding] [Travis] They're coming. Hold on! [banging on door] [EKG beeping rapidly] She's scared. You're scaring her! -[banging stops] -[breathing heavily] [breathing heavily] [breathing heavily] [footsteps receding] [beeping steadies] [mouthing] Shh. [exhales heavily] They're gone. -[bangs on door] -[Melissa shrieks] [breathing heavily] [footsteps receding] [gasping] [Brad] There you go. There you go. [Melissa breathing heavily] What is happening? [Brad] I don't know. I don't know. We should have just let them do it. Do what? Hey. Who's "them"? Did you make enemies in there, Travis? -Is that who this is? -No. That's not who it is. [Melissa] Would they do that? Your family, would they-- [Travis] They're not our family. [Brad] Hey, look at me. -I'm asking you a question. Who is it? -Don't touch me. -What aren't you telling us, Travis? -Don't touch me. -I'm asking you a question. -[Melissa] Stop it! [Travis] Get off me! [Melissa] Stop it! Stop it! [EKG monitor beeps] -[powering up] -[Melissa sighs] [breathing heavily] [sighs] [Brad breathing heavily] [EKG beeping] [Brad] What the fuck? What do they want? [Travis] They want us to give her this. [Brad] They can't get in this room. Stop. Travis. Stop it. Fine. You don't wanna do this, then why don't we just pull the plug? No. You're a fucking hypocrite. She's suffering, Brad. I'll do it. [Brad] You don't even know what you'd be doing. -No, you cannot get involved in this. -I'm already involved. What is she talking about? -How is she involved? -[Melissa] Uh... -Is this about the money? -This isn't about money. -What are you two angling at? -We're not angling at anything. He's cutting us out, Brad. -Who? -George. How do you know that? -Not about the money, huh? -How do you know that? Ronnie told me. -Well, he's playing you. -Maybe. And maybe we can't fix that. But we can fix this. Listen to him. But if we do this, what? You think that they're just gonna let us go? Yes. They're offering mercy. We can't just go pumping God knows what into her. It's experimental. It's not fucking heroin. Who are we, huh? We're not doctors. We're her sons. It'll work. [Brad] I know it will. And when it does... then what happens? What? To her? To us. -What're you doing? -I'm gonna go for help. -No, you're not. -What else are we gonna do? -Well, we'll try the police. -On what? -My cell phone. It's on the bureau. -[Melissa] No. [Brad] I can go get it. [Melissa] No. No. My room's closer. No. No, no, no. No, no. It's too dangerous. They're gonna get in this room eventually. Fuck. -It's okay. -No, it's not. I have to try. Fuck, man. Hey. I have to try. [sighs] Damn it. [floor creaking] Shit. [Melissa] There's Travis. There you are. Where's the other guy? [Brad] What's that right there? [Melissa] What? [Brad] There. [Melissa] Where? [Melissa screaming] [Brad and masked man grunting] [Melissa groans] [motorbike starting] -[engine revving] -[grunts] [Travis grunts] [Travis grunting] [gun cocks] [Travis groans] [Brad] No! No! No! [church bell tolling] [church bell continues tolling] [tolling stops] [door opens] [door closes] [country music playing over car radio] [sighs] [door creaks] [EKG beeping] [footsteps thumping] [both grunting] [George screams] [masked man panting] [creaking] Come on. [water flowing] [wolves howling on TV] [upbeat music playing on TV] [man on TV] Step by step, as the mill prospered... -[sighs] -...the farmers got more money. Until they, like the miller and his helpers, could buy automobiles and radios and electric... ...and the other conveniences to make farm life easier and happier. Today, in industry, the money invested... [man on TV continues speaking indistinctly] ...make it possible for him to produce more and thus to earn more. No wonder the American workman has become the highest paid in the world, with the greatest amount of leisure time. No wonder, too, that we consumers have benefited through the production of continually better goods at lower prices. Yet it all seems so natural... [T.J. sighs] Hello, and thank you for choosing to learn more about the New Life Church where worship and devotion, both to Christ and our fellow members, serve as the foundation of our belief. At the New Life Church, we cherish the opportunity to serve the Lord as part of his flock. But we also consider ourselves shepherds in our own right, dutifully protecting one another from the wolves of the world who might wish to prey upon us. Our parishioners include lawyers and doctors and school teachers, young and old. All races and backgrounds, people from all walks of life. We are all the same in the eyes of God. Each of us is special. And so are you. So join me now for a more in-depth look at... [Grace groans] [man] Grace. [Grace] It's okay. [man] Grace, what is it? Your nose is bleeding. -No, it's okay. -[man] No, it's not okay. Look at your nose. This is... Look at me. And the bruise. Look! Did he-- [Grace] Bradley, he just... It's okay. Look at me, look at me. He can't keep hitting you. -Do you understand? -I know, I'm sorry. [man] You have nothing to be sorry for... All right, that's it. Turn the camera-- [thudding] [door creaking] [curtain hook clatters] [T.J. groans] [T.J. grunts] [masked man groaning] [T.J. grunting] [whispering] I'm losing my mind. Jesus Christ. [sighs] [urinating] [toilet flushing] [both grunting] [toilet stops flushing] [thumping] [masked men breathing heavily] -What's going on? -Shh. Listen, I'm not sure. [clatters] [Brad] Go on. [masked man] Go, go, go. [T.J. grunting] [masked man 1] Mark, Peter. Peter! Come on. [masked man 2] Shit! [masked man 1] No, no, no! Oh, man. Oh, man, oh, man. Okay, okay. Oh! Okay, okay. [masked man 3 screams] Oh, God! [masked man 1] Oh, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. [masked man 2] What do we do? What do we do? [masked man 1] Take him to the hospital, Peter! -What do you think we do? -What do you mean, the hospital? [masked man 1] Stop! Help me get him up! Come on. [masked man 3 groans] [all grunting] [masked man 1] You got him. You got him. [footsteps thudding] Jesus! [breathing heavily] [Travis] Our tires are slashed. -Where are Ronnie and T.J.? -I don't know. -What do you mean you don't know? -I mean I don't fucking know! They're not in their beds. You think that they slashed the tires? Brad? [Travis breathing heavily] [Melissa screams] [Brad] Melissa! [screaming] Ah, fuck! [Melissa panting] [screaming] [panting] [continues panting] [whimpers] [grunts] [gasping] [panting] -[T.J. grunts] -[Melissa screams] God! [both grunting] [T.J.] No, no! [choking] [Travis] Brad! [Travis] Come here, come. [Brad] Go, go, go! -Go! Go! Go! Come on. -[Travis] Go, go, go. [banging on door] [Brad] Where's Melissa? [Travis] Let's go! [gasps] [Travis stutters] Get the dresser. [Travis grunting] [Melissa] Brad? You're scaring her! [banging stops] -[EKG beeping rapidly] -[sighs] [sighs] [breathes heavily] I'm sure he's fine. You don't trust him either. [Brad sighs] I want to. [Melissa] What kind of family is this? -I told you about my father. -[Melissa] Yeah. [Brad] Well, I don't think his death was an accident. I think it was my mother's church. He wouldn't stop hitting her. So they made him stop. [Melissa] Is that who you think these people are? I'm sure of it. [Brad exhales] [Melissa] There's Travis. [Melissa screaming] [glass shatters] [motorbike starting] [engine revving] [Brad grunts] [Travis grunting] [grunting] [both grunting] [gun cocks] No. No! Help! Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, God! [sobbing] [yelling] Oh, God! -It's okay. Hey. -Oh, my God! [Brad exhales sharply] Oh, God. I'm sorry. Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh... [grunts] [masked man] You're okay. [Melissa gasps] [Brad] Motherfucker! Come on! [Brad grunting] -[Brad continues grunting] -[banging] [sighs] [sighs] I know it might seem like what we're doing is wrong. But it's not. [sobbing] I... I didn't think it would come to this. They gave us no choice, Hank. [stuttering] I can't... I can't do this any-- Hank. It's okay. [breath trembles] I'm sorry. Hank! [breath trembles] [sighs] [masked man 1] What about the girl? [masked man 2] She's innocent. [masked man 3] Not after all she's seen. [Dr. Turner] We can't lose sight of what's going on here. We can't give up on Grace. Look. I didn't want this either. I was hoping we'd get in and get out without anybody getting hurt, especially not one of us. But that... It's not what happened. If anyone else wants to go... [stutters] I understand. [EKG beeping] [Melissa] Let's just forget about the money. I don't want to. [Melissa sighs] And they're not gonna stop me from getting it. No. Brad. No, no, no. [Melissa breathing heavily] Come on! Come on! [breathing heavily] [alarm beeping] [Melissa] Okay, go. Run! [Brad] Come on! Come on! [Melissa screams] -No! -Come on. Come on. [breathing heavily] -[Brad grunting] -[screaming] I'm sorry. No! No, Brad! No! [screaming] [banging on door] Okay! I'm gonna do it. -[banging continues] -[Brad breathing heavily] I'm doing it. Okay? [banging stops] [gasping] [coughing] [gasping] [Brad] It's done! All right? Do you hear me? It's done! She's alive! All right, you got what you wanted. I gave her the cure. [breathing heavily] Answer me, goddamn it! She's alive! [EKG beeping] [door opens] [footsteps approaching] [gunshot] [instrumental music playing] Synced by Peterlin
