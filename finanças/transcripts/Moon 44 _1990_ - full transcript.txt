We're under the attack by Pirite. We finally analyzed their system. The spacecraft are drones! I repeat, drones, piloted by robots. Do you read me? We'll all be killed! Mayday! Mayday! At least we finally know what we're dealing with. - Any survivors? - No chance. So what's being done about it? Pirites are capturing one of our moons after another, and we're going broke. Those bastards used to buy their fuel from us. - I warned the board before. We can't defend the mining operation if you keep cutting my budget! We're not a military operation like Pirite. Our money is spent on research, equipment... There are no alternatives left. We have to defend ourselves, do we not? We're listening. They've already captured 51, 47, 46... The only one left up there is Moon 44. And they'll be next. It's ironic, we already had a working defense system up there. And you canceled it. Because too many pilots got killed in training. Those pilots were having to navigate in extreme weather conditions. Pirite obviously managed to deal with it. - And so will my men! Two weeks ago I've set up a new group of navigators. They'll make it a hell of a lot safer for the pilots. Look, Stevens. Your 'navigators' are barely out of their teens. - They're kids. - I tested them. They're the best! But, I'm having a hell of a time finding pilots. No one wants to volunteer for the outer zone anymore. We had to send up prisoners. Convicts? You're putting our prime assets in the hands of prisoners... and a bunch of computer wizkids? - Baker is right. As usual. We can't afford to take chances. But I've taken certain precautions. Let me remind everyone... What's at stake here is not Moon 44, but our mining shuttles. Without them, Galactic Mining is finished. That's why I've ordered the station commander of Moon 44 to launch all shuttles at the first sign of attack. You gave him control of the shuttles? But what about the crew? Mr. Chairman, their only chance to escape is hitching a ride on the shuttles. I'm afraid that's impossible. They'll have to stay and fight. - They would get massacred. - We're all making our sacrifices. Or would you prefer to encourage Pirite, to go on and on with this takeover? Ladies and gentlemen... Mr. Chairman... Moon 44. We've got a problem. Contact Internal Affairs immediately. Get me their best agent. No one's gonna go up there on a mission like that. It would be suicide. Even an Internal Affair's agent doesn't need to know... everything. Yes, sir. "Welcome to the western quadrant of Galactic Mining's Earth headquarters." "All passengers with Alpha clearance..." - Rise and shine, we're home. - Fuck you! You know something, Lieutenant? You've got a real attitude problem. Unlock me, or you'll gonna have a real problem. Fuck up and I'll take you with me, I swear it. Dad, look! - Come on! But that man... ! - I.A. - Internal Affairs. I know who you are. Who's he? That's Lieutenant Gallagher. - Captain... You guys will never change. It wasn't even loaded. - You're crazy! You're nuts! God damn cop! - You really enjoy this shit, don't you? - No. "Galactic Mining wants you to enjoy your stay..." "...but reminds you to be cautious..." "Do not reveal the nature or location of your assignments to strangers." "Report any of irregularities or suspicious persons directly to Internal Affairs immediately." Three months on a double-bonus job. - How did you finally catch him? - What's the difference? I got him. - You're short! - Kickback for your next job. I don't pay kickbacks! Stone, this is Brown from Headquarters. We want to see you immediately upon your arrival. This is an extremely important matter. We've already informed Internal Affairs... ...to relieve you of all further duties. This is a top priority. Your records show you graduated Yeagle Flight Academy with distinction. Fifth in your class. - Have you flown much since then? - No. Why...? Why did you quit the military? I'm not very good at taking orders. Then what made you join Internal Affairs? They let me operate alone, the way I like it. You've made several requests for termination of your contract. - Why do you want to quit? I arrest them and lock them up... But your kind of prison system just makes them worse. That's no way to change people. Come on Stone, you want changes, you do something about it! You don't quit to... study classical literature. What's this all about? Is this an interrogation? - No! We have a proposition for you, Mr. Stone. A critical assignment. You complete it... ...and we'll grant you release from your contract. You'll be free to do as you please. I'm listening. Moon 44. The most important mining operation in the galaxy. Over 100 mining shuttles operate there. Robots, machinery... Worth billions. They dig around the clock, fill up... Then they shuttle millions of tons of raw material back here. And we convert it into solid fuel. It is our prime income. Our livelihood. Recently, Mr. Stone, someone meddled with the primal forces of nature. Someone tempered with our very existence. Two of these magnificent shuttles disappeared in transit. Lost in space. A technical defect. So we thought. But to our surprise, we found out they were actually stolen. We have reliable information from a navigator stationed on Moon 44. His name is Tyler. - A whistle blower? We want you to go up and investigate. - What's the catch? - Catch? There's no catch. But you'll have to go undercover with a group of prisoners. They're in training to become fighter pilots. - Are you expecting an attack? - Certainly not. This is merely a routine training exercise. Well, Mr. Stone, do we have a deal? Jake O'Neal! Moose Haggerty! Scooter Bailey! Come on, come on! Move out! Come on, let's move it! All right, fall in! You assholes! You think you've hit the jackpot! You're gonna come crawling back here, begging me to take you back! You gonna lick my stick to get in here again! "This is Moon 44 base, you are clear to land at Galileo canyon." Don't push me! "Automated docking sequence released." "Manual mode engaged. Proceed to the dock..." "Mining shuttles now clear of all passengers. Commence operation." "Welcome to Moon 44." "One of Galactic Mining's most valuable mining resources" "for solid fuel. The output per year amount to..." Do you know this guy? "The loads are transported immediately back to Galactic Mining headquarters." - Moose, who is the Einstein? - I never saw him in the yard before. "Galactic Mining wishes you a nice stay." Up and at 'em. - Hey Cookie, new pilots are here. - No, man, new customers. - You're sick, you know that? - Thank you! Alright, ladies. Come on, up and at 'em! We've got company! And how are you today, Alfred? "New arrivals please assemble in landing dock." The prisoners? Fall in! Attention! My name is Sykes. I am your training sergeant. Before you men got into trouble with the law some of you were pilots. The company is giving you a chance to reduce your prison sentence. I think this is very nice of them. Do exactly as you are told and you will leave here free men. Screw up, and you'll be sent back to prison for the remainder of your incarceration. Jake O'Neal. You're a real beaut, Jake. Stealing military jets. - Murder one. - Self defense. Is that so? Do you really think that I care? Put that god damn cigarette out! Well, Mr. Stone. I see that you're an ex-fighter pilot. Refused orders. Insubordination. You some kind of tough guy? - Maybe. - Shut up! Now you listen to me, shit head! And you listen good! I've been holding my breath for a long time for somebody like you. Got anything to say to that? Answer me when I talk to you. I think you got me confused with somebody who takes you seriously. Shut up, god damn it, before you piss me off! - Man's got a death wish. - No. Man's got balls. Sex! I need sex, not boots, huh. Hey fellas, looky here. We got some real pussy! Hey... - That's enough. - This is your Station commander, Major Lee. May I talk to you, major? - Sargent, throw them some raw meat. - Yes, sir! You've heard the Major! The Major is a very kind man... - Who are those morons? Welcome to the real world. Listen, it's a company decision. Prisoners come a hell of a lot cheaper than pilots. Yeah, well, our lives depend upon those people, Major! - That's the way this company does it's business. - Well, how can you accept that? You should just take it easy. Every thing's gonna work out OK. "All new arrivals report to crew quarters!" Sergeant! Sir? Put Stone on the first training flight. With pleasure. Hi! Welcome to Moon 44. My name is Tyler. - Shit! We only have just the one air conditioner in the back. Great. Hi. Welcome to Moon 44. My name is Tyler. Have I ceased to exist? - Do you masturbate a lot? - Come here, pretty boy! You wanna move in with me? Hey, kid, don't worry. Scooter's a music lover, just like you. What are you looking at? Get that rat out of here! He wants you to play first trumpet in his band. Yo, fighter pilot. I want you to bunk next to me... ...you know, read me bedtime stories, tuck me in. What do you say? Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing, man? That's my bunk! Would you tell that guy to stop it? That's my bunk he's playing with. Was, buddy. Was. You think you're pretty tough, huh? Well, we'll see how tough you are. Wait 'till the end of the week. If you're still alive. Are you threatening me, propeller-head? - I'm just telling you the facts. - Hey! What facts? What's going on? - Sarge, these guys stole our bunks. - Your bunks? This isn't a sand box, little man! Where's the smartass? I'm talking to you. Congratulations. You've got the first training flight. Good luck. "Felix Stone, report to hangar 3." What are you waiting for, Mr. Stone? Have a nice flight! "Open bay doors." "Clear for take-off." Alright, gentlemen, step this way, please! Alright, now listen up. Stay cool, concentrate, you just let old Tyler take care of the rest. - OK. Well, this looks pretty basic, Tyler. - Try the red button. - Red button? - Starts the engine. Hey, I'm impressed! - Okay. Listen up! - You're the boss. Our defense system is based on the perfect interaction of pilot and navigator. You are separated but you function as one unit. So these wimps sit on their skinny butts while we risk our necks? Your life depends upon you listening to these guys. - Great. - Ready? Right. Ready! I'm counting on you. Alright. Pull her up, but... ...take it easy, cowboy. Cool, let's see if nature boy can really fly. Hey, not bad. Listen, we always get trade winds here. So stay away from the rim of the canyon. Roger. Come right to a heading of 2-6-3. Jesus Christ, there's nothing but walls! That's why you got me here, pal. Let me be your eyes. Get a feel for the bird. Okay, good. Now turn left. Tighter... Good. Now keep copter leveled. Leveled! - Right. - You're on-line but you're hanging too low. Pull up! - Stone, do you read? - Roger. - Watch the robot, straight ahead. The robot? The what? Up, god damn it, up! Take it easy. It was a near miss. That was a near hit. Now listen, you're heading straight for a wall. Just pull up! Pull straight up! Alright, ahem... Alright, forget it, forget it... Just let it fall! - Let it fall? Do it now! Good. Alright, but slow down a bit. This thing turns into a dead end. Slow down a bit! - You must listen to his commands! Listen to his commands! Stone! Hit the brakes! - Well, this looks like a dead end. - No kidding? - You figured that out all by yourself, huh? - Return to base. - Brilliant, lady. - Nice job, Tyler. Next time use the lighter built into the dash. It's right under the red button. - Where's the ashtray, wiseguy? Ashtray? What do you think this is, a limo? I'm coming in. Don't be so hard on yourself. You didn't do too bad. - What do you know? - About flying? Everything! What the hell's going on out there, huh? They ran out of suckers. That's why they had to go and draft you guys. I got news for you, pal. We're sitting ducks here. - Oh yeah? Why's that? - Are you kidding me? Galactic Mining has lost one planet right after another. Everybody massacred in surprise attacks. They don't even know how it happened, cause there's no survivors. - How do you like that? - I don't. You're the snitch, huh? - I'm no snitch. - Your name is Tyler, isn't it? So what do you know about the hijackings? So you're the specialist? You're supposed to be an undercover agent, you know, cool, unobtrusive. But you've been in nothing but hot water ever since you got here. Are you gonna cut the crap and tell me what's happening or what? What's in it for me? What do you want? Well, I discovered that someone was stealing mining shuttles, right? I reported it, I got the proof. That's gotta be worth something. - How about we split fifty-fifty. - Fifty-fifty of what? Don't you guys collect special bonuses for kamikaze missions like this? Partner? Hi, guys! What's up? Nothing, sarge. I was just debriefing Stone. - Debriefing him from what? - The training flight, sir. - You think you're funny, don't you? - No... err, yes. - I mean... if I say no, does that mean I'm funny? - No. You're not funny, I'm funny! - Ignore him. Don't show him you're scared. - I am scared! Guys, we can't just ignore them. We gotta do something, right? And what exactly is it you wanna do, Cookie? First of all, I'm gonna try to make some money off of them. You don't care about anyone but yourself, do you, Cookie? - Man... It's a tough world out there. I'm just a business man, trying to survive. That's all. Bug off! - Stud, you lost? - No, I'm not lost. I came to deal. I'm the Cookie Man. Cover all your highs. Uppers, Downers, Whoopers, Scoopers Benies, Zonkers, Pinks and Blues. - Whatever you guys need, Cookie Man's got it. - Get the hell out of here. We're not junkies. Did you hear me say anything about junkies? Let me tell you... It's rough up here man. I'm just offering you a little something to relax. Shithead. You get your pill factory out of my face! Hey, hero. I saved you a seat! - Hey asshole, I'm talking to you! - No, you're not. You're talking to yourself. Listen up! In honor to promote pilot-navigator collaboration I have decided to honor our new fighter pilot with KP. And our friend Mr. Wisenheimer here is going to show him the ropes. Who? Me? And just to make it a bit more interesting... and to avoid KP yourselves, I would like each and every one of you to contribute his share. Gentlemen, if you please. Wisenheimer. Why don't you take a little break and get me something to eat? Yes, sir. Right away, sir. A little rough, isn't it, Sykes? Yeah, I'll fix his dinner! I'll fix his dinner good! I'm trying to maintain discipline here. Of course that's something that obviously you know very little about. Being a civilian... ...and a woman. If you're such a great leader of men... ...how come you're not an officer? I mean... ...what went wrong with your career, Sergeant? Just gonna mix in a little of the old secret sauce. There you go. Just like mama used to make. Give him the potatoes... Hope the bastard doesn't shit for a month! You call this evidence? Hey, a little louder! I don't think they heard you back on Earth. Wanna keep it down a little? Jesus! That's not the only evidence we got. I got plenty more down in shuttle control. Oh, look. You got the book all wet. Oh, oh! What we got here? Seasoning. Yeah! - Wisenheimer? - Coming! Dinner for one. Bon appetit... Sarge. Shit! You trying to get rid of me? You need one of these things. Makes the job a whole lot easier. When we get back, I'm thinking of selling this thing. Gonna call it "Mr. Burglar". Any second now... whoosh! Has to warm up a little. Alright! "Mr. Burglar". Don't leave home without it. Galactic Mining figured their shuttles had 'technical defects'. But according to my calculations, they're dead wrong. They didn't just disappear into space. They were stolen! How do you figure that, kid? Well, it's based on a little theory of mine called... ...contiguous geometric mathematical probability relationships. Alright, mining shuttle number 112 left a week ago, no one's heard from it since. The mathematical probability, the odds of one of these suckers getting... ...lost in space... We're talking 1 to 1429. That means maybe, maybe like one every 40, 45 years would disappear. - Not every month like it is now. - What are all these units for? Each one of those is connected to one in the shuttle. It's sort of an automatic flight plan. Wait a minute. If the shuttles are on automatic pilot... and they're not reaching their programmed destination, then... That means somebody's tampering with the computers! - You got it! - Well, how? How the fuck should I know, Sherlock? That's why we got you here. Wait, I can... I can tell you which one's going to be next. We've got a winner, number 117. - 117, right Here. Alright. See this number? Means in 22 hours, this shuttle will not belong to Galactic Mining. This I guarantee! Hey, Stone, where are you going? Hey, Stone! Wait up, man! What do you think, huh? Stay out of it, kid, I'll take care of it. Hey, what, are you kidding me? Come on, we're partners! I showed you everything! - So what? Stone! I'm scared. I gotta get out of here, man. I'm a street kid, you know. A hacker. I'm not like one of these corporate eggheads. I took this job cause I thought it was going to be fun. I didn't expect this. See, I help you... ...and they let me out of my contract... as a reward. - Maybe. - Look, it's obvious there's gonna be another attack! I don't wanna die here. You'll put in a good word. - And have my bonus. Forget the bonus, alright? What do you say? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow! Where you going, pretty boy? - Let go! - Let go? You don't like me? That hurts. But what about one of my lovely buddies? Same old shit, Scooter. - Get away from me! - Too skinny. Come on, listen! Back in prison, we dreamed of a nice pretty boy like you... ...and we turned him into a nice pretty girl. And we know how to keep our girls real happy. Don't we, guys? Come on, Scooter. He got the message. Why don't you let him go, ha? - No, he's just shy. - Come on, let him go. Why don't you get out of here? You'll come around, won't you? - No, no! Help me, please! - Shut up! - You got a problem, Sergeant? - Yes, sir, we got a problem. I just saw Stone in shuttle control! I know. Stone's a cop. Internal Affairs. Holy shit. What in the fuck are we supposed to do if Stone catches on? Look, Sergeant. I don't see there's a problem. Accidents sometimes happen. You're not serious! I mean, first you get me to help you steal shuttles, that's one thing... ...but what you're talking about now is murder! - Oh, please! Spare me. Do you wanna know what the company's priorities are for this rat hole? Let me tell you in one word... Shuttles! That's all they care about! The god damn shuttles mean more to them than you, me, the entire crew! - I don't believe that! - No? Well, what have I got the master keys for? They've been screwing us for a long time. Now it's time we screwed them. Marc? Marc! What happened? Leave me alone. - Who did this to you? - Don't touch me! - I'm sorry! - Just don't touch me! - God damn it! - Could you just leave me alone? Those bastards are gonna pay for this! I swear to God they will! "Attention all personnel! Prepare all copters for training flights!" "Lock all weapons into unarmed position!" "Tag teams will be as follows..." "Team 1: Stone F., Tyler R. Team 2: O'Neil J., Schultz D." "Team 3: Haggerty M., Kowalski L. Team 4: Field L., Login T." "Team 5: Bailey S., Follow M." Alright, let's knock out the systems checkout. - Roger that. - Alright, just call them out. - Come on, Freddy! - Number 5, Patrick. - Final check list complete. - All systems are go? - All systems are go! "First competition: Stone F., Tyler R." "Opposing: O'Neil J., Schultz D." Let's show this asshole how to fly! "Attention tech-crew!" "Prepare copters for simulated attack." "Lock all weapons on the unarmed position!" "All pilots..." "This is only a training flight! This is only an exercise!" "Only a simulation! There are no points for hot-shots!" Clear on 3! Come on, sweetheart! Make Scooter fly! Make me feel real good! - Pull up. - All ready for fun and games? - Ready. OK, boys, I'm reading you loud and clear! Alright, pull her up. OK, maintaining speed. - "OK, bossman, let's fly!" - Cookie! What are you doing on my radio? - I'm your navigator. - Fucking piss ant drug bag for a navigator! - "I'm talking about flying high, not getting high!" "OK man, pull her up!" Watch your heading, watch your heading! "Now pull a sharp right!" - What are you doing? I said right! - Gimme some news! - Calm down! He's still hugging your tail. Jake O'Neal. How you doing, Jake? Say your prayers, sucker. I've got you! - Sucker's right, bossman! - Alright, up again! - Rock formation at 11 degrees. Watch out! - Great! - Damn it! - Tyler, this is not a video game! Get serious! I can't shake him loose! Where I come from, they call this flying! Pull up! God damn it, up! - Alright, I got an idea. - Well, lay it on me! - When I tell you, pull up instantly! Got it? - Right. - We've got them! Pull over to the left. Steady! - If you miss, I'll nail your ass! - Alright, hold still man! Steady. Steady. - Steady! - I've got him locked in! Okay, Stone. - Eat this! - Now! - Cookie Man! - Get the hell out of there! - Jesus! - O'Neal, cease fire immediately! - Stone, you alright? - "I'm coming in." - Stone, are you okay? - As opposed to what, Ms. Morgan? - Come on home, Stone. The training helicopters shouldn't even be armed! That's Sargent Sykes' responsibility! He's the best training Sergeant I've got. Well... And how come he treats everybody like shit, Major? I don't know. I'll have to ask him. Sykes. - Lee here. Come to my office right away! Yes, sir. So much for that idea. Any other suggestions? Just calm down. We've got work to do. Here... You take care of next shuttle. I'll take care of Stone! Sergeant... Just lighten up a little. I've got everything under control. - "Come on, sweetheart"! - Slow down. You know I like it fast. "Come on, honey!" Come on, stop this bullshit! Hey, don't slow me down. "Honey, come on." Okay. You want fast? You'll get fast! Ah, come on, yeah! I love it! "Yeah, that's good. Yeah!" That's enough, baby. What are you doing? "Come on, cut me back right now." Marc, he gets the idea. Hey, what are you doing? Cut me back, son of a bitch! "Wait 'till I come back, I'm gonna break your neck!" Marc, slow that copter down right now! - "Cut me back! Cut me back!" - Marc! - Cut me back! - Marc! Why? One more act of revenge, and I send every damn one of you back to prison! I am responsible for order here! And by God, order is what I'm going to have! And if I don't have it, I'll make your asses suffer for it! - Excuse me, Sergeant. - May I please talk to the men? - Just who in the hell do you think you are? You're responsible for this incident. If you hadn't left the control center, that pilot might very well still be alive. You wanna talk to me about responsibility, Sergeant Sykes? Let's talk about the first training helicopter going up armed! That's your responsibility, isn't it? - Just what are you trying to suggest? - Sergeant Sykes! Let her talk. - Now listen. I don't really think that any of you want to go back to prison. So there is only one alternative. And that is that you regard what happened as an unfortunate accident. - Accident? Who the fuck are you kidding? Scooter was murdered! - Bullshit! You know what happened. These guys started it! - And you finished yet? - Back off, O'Neil! - Stop fighting! You listen to me. I saw the wrecks in the canyons. You killed a lot of pilots long before we got here! We didn't come here to die. I'm sorry about Scooter. But the program works. You have to trust each other. Refusal to fly will put you back in prison. Anyone who wants to stay, please step forward. What's up with that, homie? - Right. Take him down, take him down! Smart boy, you're not so smart... If one of my guys... - You die! - Hey, hey! Listen. You cut in my territory again, you're dead meat! - You already tried that once. - That was an accident! If I wanted to kill you, you'd be dead! Are you gonna take this down to the cell? Look, do me a big favor and let me take it in to the guy. I think he could really use to see a friendly face about now. You know, he's not a bad kid, Sarge. Look, I just wanna give him his music. I know, call it strange if you will, but the guy feels... ...he can not digest his food properly, unless he has his opera. Personally I can't stand this shit! I like the more contemporary stuff. Fuck art, let's dance. You know what I mean? Sarge... Sarge, listen to me, ahem... I promised his mother I'd take care of him, you know? Thanks. Thanks, Sarge! I really appreciate this! You're prince among kings, I mean that! Marc! I hope you're hungry! Call the doctor! Call him now! Marc! Don't die, Marc! Just don't die, alright? - Cookie, we need your help. - You in some kind of trouble or something? This isn't some kind of game, Cookie. You're either in with us or you're against us! - Chill! Chill down a bit, alright? - What's the worst stuff you got? What are you, turning into an addict or something? - No. I'm just gonna get those bastards, that's all. Half of yellow will lift you into orbit. Real rocket man. Could put you in the zoo. I'll take two. - That would probably kill a horse! - I said, I'll take two! Let the expert do it, alright? Watch this. Hey, man. Hey! Why don't you turn that damn music down, huh? - You don't like my music? - No! Enjoy your meal. What the hell is that? - That's dumb. Really dumb! - Stay out it, alright? Marc was like a... a brother to me, man. And I talked him into coming here. Hey, that's wrong, man? What's wrong? - I told you... - I wouldn't do that if I were you, Jake! - Fuck off! - Leave him alone! I'll wipe my ass with you wimps! Don't mess with my life! - I said, leave him alone! - What are you gonna do? You gonna kill him? Is that the idea? You kill him... you better be prepared to kill all of us. Cause if he doesn't get you... I will! And if not me, then one of them! We control the food, the air... Everything that runs this place! If you hurt him, or any of these guys... What happened to Moose is gonna happen to you. All of you! Only it's gonna be worse! A lot worse! You deserve to die, you piece of shit! Without these faggots we don't fly. And I ain't going back to prison! Man, you really zombied! I'm not surprised. I slipped you two double whammies. Hey, man... I'm really not like that. It's just that... You guys are so... Rough. It's like... When I was in school... Everyone used to always beat up on me. Oh, man. Gets real lonely, you know? I got tired of talking to my french fries. But then... Then... then I got smart, man. I started selling my home made stuff, you know... Suddenly, I was everybody's friend. It's... It's a nice feeling, you know? "Entry code accepted. Please enter data." "Flight destination. Shuttles are programmed to arrive..." "...at Galactic Mining headquarters airport at 0200 hours." "Do you want to change destination?" "Enter new destination now." "Mining shuttle 117 commencing liftoff." Whatcha you doing there, curly? I'll be needing that. Like hell you will! Why did you have to come here, Stone? Things were going just fine until you showed up! You think I like it here? I'm just a God damn pawn! I don't kill people, I train them! And I'm not gonna take the fall alone! What the hell is going on here? - Felix Stone, Internal Affairs. Lucky for you Mr. Stone, I happened to stop by. Yeah. He was the hijacker. I caught him red-handed. Doesn't surprise me. Look at this. He must have been the one who broke into my safe! I'll take that. It's evidence. I'm sorry but I can't give you this. You better have a damn good reason, Major. I do have a damn good reason. It's the only key to stop the shuttles in case of an emergency. And what kind of emergency would that be? Anything can happen. - Company orders. - Is that's so? Shit! I crapped out. It ain't gonna be your best for long, that's for sure. Oh, look, it's the pig. Hey, Shakespeare. I always knew there was something different about you. Cop! You forgot something. Keep it. Read it. I already did. "Control to taxi crane. Are you ready for departure?" Stone! How about putting in a good word for me down at headquarters? Yeah, sure, I'll see what I can do. "Pilot Stone, report to taxi crane for departure immediately." Hey, look, kid... Stay out of trouble. "Receiving transmission from Galactic Mining headquarters." "Code red." "Enemy spacecraft approaching Moon 44." "ETA 52 minutes." "Enemy battle cruiser, Medusa class configuration." "Length, 6324 feet." "Fully armored, 28 laser rocket guns..." "150 hypersonic attack aircraft." - It's you? - Who did you expect? "Master key accepted." "Reset time of departure now." "Shuttles programmed to..." Let's see what Lee's been hiding. - They working? - Got it! "Enemy aircraft approaching. Prepare for attack!" It's happening. - It's an attack. - Sound the alarm. - It's not responding. Well, fix the damn thing and get in your cradle! Stone! Thanks for coming back. "Moon 44 is under attack! Man all battle stations!" - Interceptors 2-0-5. - Got it! - "Alright, pal, you are on your way!" Stone, ahead of you appear two targets, bearing 2-3-0. I have visual. - Move closer, I've got to get a lock on them! "Identify. RPV-fighter." Pal, you're chasing drones. Robots. "- There's not a breathing body aboard." Breaking formation! "Alright, stay with them." Increase speed! "Hold formation." Steady, steady. Stay with him. Stone! "We got him!" Firing! - What the hell is going on? - We're under attack. - Who is out there? - Stone. - Stone? You didn't think he'd leave us, did you? Stone, what are you doing out there? I... I couldn't stay away? "All shuttles ready for liftoff." "Commence liftoff." Hey, Tyler, the mining shuttles are taking off. "Somebody's gotta stop Lee!" - It's OK, I can handle it. Bandits are approaching the station. They're coming straight at us! - "I have visual." "- Stone, bearing 2-3-5, forty degrees!" "Stone, are you on?" - Shit! - Tyler, here I am! Shit! Stone, you're on your own! Take your best shot! - Firing! Stone, you're beautiful! Stone, you are doing... Stone? Stone?! "Can you read me?" "Stone, do you copy?" Screw him. He was just a cop anyway. He was just a cop? - Hey. - You son of a bitch! - Hey! No more fighting! No more fighting, alright kid? All the shuttles are taking off. Taking off without us. It means we're stranded here, fellas. There's a new wave of bandits approaching quickly! Well, you guys, it looks like it's curtain time for us. - "Come in Tyler!" Come on Tyler, wake up! - Stone? Stone, we thought you ate it! Hey, I just spotted our ticket home. There's one mining shuttle left. "Load the crew into the taxi crane! I'm coming in. - Roger." - Oh, and Stone. - What? - "Have a cigarette for me." - Right. We'll never make it. They're gonna be right on top of us... ...before we have any chance of escaping. No, we can make it. We need... Time. I can hold them off. Tyler, get everybody out of here. Means one of us is gonna have to stay, guys. Gee. Well, apparently, I'm his navigator so I guess... ...that means me. - Good luck. - Thanks. - Alright, let's go! Let's hit it, let's move! "New destination..." Why? No you don't! Good luck! Okay, Cookie Man, you little dirt bag, let's get this show on the road. Let's you and me party! "Copter cleared for liftoff." I can do this. I can do this! Jake, bandits are approaching the station. How do you start this flying piece of garbage? "Thank you. All systems ready." Bandits are at 6 o'clock. I'll take care of myself. Now get the hell out of there! - Join the others. - You're trying to dump me, huh? Still think you can make it without the Cookie Man. Come on! Yeah! Oh God, who needs this shit? - Come on. - Shut the lock! - It's about time! - Are you there? - Yes. Yes, I'm here. Wow man, they must really like you. There's a whole squadron coming right at you, man! Yeah, I got them on monitor. - Must be your fan club. - "No fans, Cookie Man." It's our ride home. Yeah...! Here we go! This is real bad trip! You like that? Come here, man! Yeah come on! "Eat this, eat this, man! Yeah!" "Come on!" Get some! Yeah! There she is! We've got company. - Christ, we'll never make it! Okay, both of you down the hatch! I'm gonna drop! - You're kidding!? He's not kidding. - He's gonna drop us! - He's gonna what? "Troop container unlocked. Ten seconds to drop." Hit the deck everyone! - Is everybody ready? Let's not do that again. Our crew inflicted heavy losses on Pirite. We put up a valiant fight! But... Moon 44 was captured. There were no survivors. The robots lifted off as planned but we lost contact shortly thereafter. Not a trace! A hundred giant shuttles don't just disappear! What about a search party? In the Outer Zone? Forget it. Our gamble didn't pay off. Is that what you called a gamble? Stone! Where are the shuttles? Where's Lee? - He's dead. He had sold out to Pirite. - I don't believe you. Your God damn order made it easy to switch sides! He was my most trusted officer. - I even told him you were coming! - How could you be so gullible? What happened to our shuttles, Mr. Stone? Where are they? They're right here. Programmed by Lee. The shuttles are conveniently parked off planet for Pirite to pick up. We have to thank you, Mr. Stone. You saved our company. No, Mr. Chairman, the crew saved your company. Remember them? Those people you had written off as a liability. Sometimes there is no choice. There's always a choice! - You'll never get away with this! - Don't do it! Why the sudden concern for human life? I thought your only worry was... Hard assets. - Please, I beg you, don't destroy our future. Where are you going? I guess I'm out of a job.
