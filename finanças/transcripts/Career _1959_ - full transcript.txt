Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Hello, Charlie. I'll bet you didn't have anything to eat. - No time. I'm late as it is. - Yeah, I know. And I'm not the only one that knows. Beat it, Mario. Get us a couple of cups of coffee, will you? - Why, did the boss say anything? - What's there to say? She knows why you're late as well as I do. You had an appointment to see about a part in a show. And in a couple of weeks you'll be back with your hat in your hand... ...asking Mrs. O'Malley for your waiter's job back again. I appreciate the fact she takes me back, she knows that, Charlie, I think she's took you back for the last time, Sam. If it happens once more, you quit because of a show or you're late because of an appointment... and you're gonna get packed in. Sacked. Fired. However you want to call it. Look, Sam, I know how you feel. You figure that waiting on tables you ain't doing... Well, you figure you ain't doing what you ought to be doing. Well let me tell you something. I've been a waiter all my life. ...and I've been very happy being a waiter. The head waiter wants you two at your stations. Thanks, Mario. Being a waiter may not be what you have in your mind for your life... ...but it's something. As opposed to nothing. Don't lose it, Sam. Thanks, Charlie. What's the matter? Um... switch tables with me. Take my number 8. Somebody out there you don't want to see? Switch... switch, I'll take your table 14. I can't do that, Sam, it's too far away from my station. Charlie... Oh, Sam, Sam, I love you so. Train n. 58 now boarding on track 1, for Detroit, Buffalo... That's it. The coaster's up ahead. ...New York City. - Your kit. - Got it? Oh, watch it! Wonder where Marjorie and Alan are. Well, this must be it. One more... Thank you. Oh, Sam, why does this train have to leave? - Honey... honey, don't. - I can't help it. Barbara, try to understand. I've got to go, I've just got to. Sam, let me go with you. Just a little while longer. Then as soon as I can I'll send for you. If you're sure you want to marry an actor. I wouldn't marry anybody else. Hey! My makeup kit. Thanks, honey. Sam, Sam, hold me tight! Don't slip away from me. I'm frightened. - Barbara, Barbara... - Sam, why do you have to go? Because time goes by too quickly. I'm four years behind. I spent four years with death and they took four years of my life, Barbara. And I found out then... ...how precious life is. It's got to be used for something worthwhile. A man has got to do the thing that's most important to him. I don't know, honey, it can be climbing mountains... ...or building skyscrapers or whatever. The one thing he thinks he'll be able to do best, at least he's got to try. Don't you see, Barbara? I don't have any choice, darling. All aboard! Here we are! - Hey, Alan! - Sam! You finally made it. Hiya, Marge. - Here! Here you go. - Thanks, Alan. Hey, did you see the papers? Look. Hey, that's great news. Listen, the great news is just starting, Sam Boy. If there was ever a wrong time to leave a thriving town... ...like Lansing, Michigan, this is it. Maybe so, Alan, but not for me. Look, everybody's got wild dreams about what they want to do... ...but what's really important? To you, Alan, or to me? You know, everyone doesn't see things the same way, you know. Sam, Sam... - Write me tomorrow. - Tonight, honey, tonight! Good morning, Mrs. Eglevsky. Well, John Barrymore himself! And how are things on the Great White Way? I've got a reading for an off-Broadway group on Houston St. And from there it's just a hop, a skip, and a jump to Broadway. - Sure it is! - You're a cynic, Mrs. Eglevsky. A cynic? I take in actors. I expect to get the rent every week. That makes me a dreamer. Why, I've been a good tenant for almost an year now, Mrs. Eglevsky, right? Well... I'll get you two tickets to opening night. Just keep paying me the rent. I'll be a happy woman. Get your paper, extra, extra! Read all about it! Thank you, Mr. Novak. Thank you. Alright next, whoever's out there. Alright, let me straighten you out. The Actors' Rostrum is a group that's gonna put on... ...not only one play but a lot of plays. We're getting the nucleus of a company together right now, ...that's what these interviews are for. So, what have you done? - Uh... well... - Not that it matters. I don't go by that bunch of dumb baloney. Anyway, it's what you're gonna do that counts, right? - Yes, I was going to say... - We're gonna do a lot of things. Chekhov, Pirandello, O'Neill, Kauffman, Hart, new plays. The pay is nothing per week but it's the showcase, and good one. Every producer and agent in NYC is gonna come down here... ...because the plays I direct are going to be brilliant. I like your looks. Any questions? - Just one. - Shoot. During performances will I talk or will I just move my lips... ...while you stand backstage and say the words? You asked a question, now I'll ask one. We need backers. You got anything to invest? What's your answer to that? So long. Hey fellow, wait a minute. Hey fellow, hold it. I want to talk to you. I want to talk to you for a minute. Listen to me. Look, I don't have any money, so why waste your time? - Who wants your money? - You asked me if I had... So I asked. Is that a mortal sin? I want you in the group. Let's discuss it over lunch, huh? One dog with sauerkraut. Hold the mustard. You don't know if I can act ot not. You don't know what experience I've had. As a matter of fact, you don't know anything about me. Oh, but you're a good type. I like your approach. You're not a lot of talk. That's more than I can say for you. Oh... will you take care of this? Uh... my trust fund only pays off at the first of the month. Okay. Well, what do you say? You with me, or against me? No, I've got to make some dough. I've been living on $52.20, 20 bucks a week for 52 weeks. Veteran's rehabilitation allowance. And I'm up to my last few weeks and that's it. That's a sign you're just about rehabilitated. And as a reward, I'm gonna put you on the cushiest job you've ever had: market research. - What's that? - You go around interviewing people. You know, ask them what they think about different things, like new cars, length of women's skirts, gold standard, the color red. You get some interesting answers from bulls on that one. Twenty interviews a day and you can live like a king. Well, an ex-king. It sounds like it would take up too much time. Try to find twenty people with nothing better to do. Who finds people? I wouldn't stoop to interviewing anybody. I fake my twenty while I'm shaving. And I'll figure yours out at breakfast. Which reminds me. Where do you live? I've got a cold-water flat on 3rd Avenue. Third Avenue, huh? That's a lovely neighborhood. - You married? - No. Still I guess your place is jumping all the time with the bimbos in and out? Do you mean girls? I don't mean girl's brothers. No, no, no girls. - No girls? - Hm-hmm. No? - You do go out with girls, don't you? - No, I don't. You like girls? Of course I like girls. - Why are you telling me that you don't... - I'm engaged to a girl back home. What a relief. You know this is your lucky day? You got a part in a show, a job, a roommate... Novak's the name. Maury Novak, what's yours? Lawson, Sam Lawson. But I... Lawson, that's short enough. There'll be room for you in the mail box. This is a cold-water flat. Aren't you used to better things? I'm used to the lap of luxury, but her husband came home. Okay. But it's only temporary, because I've got other plans. Hasn't everybody else got other plans? You know, the next time I give a formal dinner party... ...I'm gonna serve these for appetizers? They put me right in the mood for lunch. How about it? No, I don't figure I could learn anything at lunch. Hey, I could learn a few things from Barrymore myself. - One, please. - Two! - Now wait a minute, Novak, I... - Count your blessings, Sam. Just think what lunch would have cost you. Now you write this down. I want an accurate account of everything I owe you. Come on, let's go in and see Jack. Maury? Sam! Barbara. - Oh, Barbara. - Sam, I can't believe it. - Oh, I mean... what are you doing here? - Let me look at you. How did you get in here? Your landlady, I told her I was your wife. My grandmother's. Sam, I couldn't stand it away from you any longer, I... I tried, but I just couldn't do it. - I missed you so. - Oh, Barbara. Barbara, are you sure you want to stay here? It's... It's too tough, you know. It's over a year now and I'm nowhere near a job. What about the Actors' Rostrum? In your letters you said... I'm not getting paid for it. I'm just barely supporting myself. Just barely with a part-time job. Sam... Sam, I got a job. - What? - Well... I knew how you'd feel, so first thing when the train got in this morning, I got a job. Have you ever heard of Sunshine Sandwich shops? Are you waiting on tables? I can't let you do that, Barbara. I'm not waiting on tables, I... I'm a spy. I go around all the shops and see if the waiters shortchange people... ...and things like that. I think it's going to be fun. Barbara, here? Are you sure you want to stay here? Of course, Sam. - Excuse me. - Oh, hi, Maury. Come on in, come on in. You must be Maury Novak. Sam's written so much about you. I'm Barbara Nielsen. Hello. And goodbye, I... ...just came over to pick up a few things, but it can wait. Don't let my being here stop you. Oh, it won't... Sam, come here. Look, I'm moving out. I found myself a new roommate. It looks like... we both did, huh? So long, Maury. - Do you still love me, Sam? - Hm? Do you still love me? More than anything else in the world, Barbara. Well... then kiss me. Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Lawson, I congratulate you. Thank you very much, sir, thank you. Mrs. Samuel Lawson. I've tried that out so many times I'm used to it. You know that if we had fifty bridesmaids, twenty ushers and Toscanini ...playing the Wedding March, you couldn't have been more beautiful, darling? Oh, the rice! Oh, that's my job... give me the rice. - Come on, honey, let's go! - Rice, rice... - Up, Michael, up! - I can't, Jim. - I can't make it. - You will if I have to carry you. Just one more river to cross and the country beyond is ours. Michael, the country beyond! We did it again. We outnumbered the audience. How long have we been open here, a year? Nobody seems to have gotten anywhere yet. Sam, I didn't tell you, but... I had a call about going to California. Just a technical job. In Hollywood? It's not an offer yet, but I have an appointment to talk about it. You know, when you least expect it in this business you can get a break. And it can happen to you tomorrow, Sam, at Kensington's casting call. Next. - Mr. Kensington. - How do you do, sir. Ann LaRue. How do you do, Miss LaRue? - I'm afraid not in this one. - Next, please. I have some of my notices, Mr. Kensington... ...if you will just spare me a minute. I'm just looking for types today. It will only take a minute. Maury, will you even look at that. Don't beg him, Sam, whatever you do, don't beg him. - Next, next, please. - Michael Moore, Mr. Kensington. - How do you do? - How do you do, sir? Sorry, there's nothing for you in the play. Next, next. This is Mr. Kensington. How do you do, Mr. Kensington? Sam Lawson. I'd like to read for the play, Mr. Kensington. - Donald's son. - Yes, Mr. Kensington! He does look the part. I'd love to read for it, Mr. Kensington. I'm afraid not, though. I've never seen you do anything. But if I look right. If you'll just let me show you... Readings don't mean a thing. I've been taken in too many times. - Sorry. - Next, please. Alright, Mr. Kensington. If you want to see me on stage, you can, right now. I've seen everything that's running now. I don't remember you from anything. I'm playing the lead in a new play, The Country Beyond. - That isn't on Broadway. - The Actors' Rostrum production. Hm, what's that? It's in the Old Seaman's Mission, off of Houston Street. Performances every night but Sundays. Take it easy, son. I can't track all the way down to off Houston Street. - It's not hard to get to. - Tell you the truth... if I go that far downtown, I get the bends. It's your duty to see him, Mr. Kensington. He gives a great performance. Well, who's this, your agent? This is Maury Novak. He directed the show. Well, I want to wish you both all the luck in the world. - Move along, please. - Er, Mr. Kensington. - Don't beg him, Sam. - Mr. Kensington... Bob! Bob! - Come on. - Will you wait just a second, please? - He doesn't want to see you! - Mr. Kensington... - How are you? - Hello, sweetheart. Nice to see you. Bob, this is Eric Peters, you remember I called you about him? - Oh, yes. How are you? - Hello, Bob. I was under the impression we had an appointment, Bob. Well, so was I, lady. Your secretary told me 10 o'clock, Mr. Kensington. And then I stand in line all the way back to 8th Avenue. Take it easy. Shirley, why don't you and Mr. Peters wait for me in dressing room A? - I'll be a few minutes. - Alright, Bob. Come on, Eric. Now look, son. Would you rather I didn't hold open calls? You actors are always complaining about no open casting calls. Mr. Kensington, as long as you come and see our show. - Oh... - If you don't trust a reading... - ...you can see me on stage. - Next, please! Yes! Now will you please allow me to get along with this? - Sure... sure. - Next, please. Come on! Oh, yes, the director. - I'm sorry, but... - I know. I'm not the type. Next! Move along, please. - Do you think he'll come? - Grow up, Sam! What do I tell Barbara? She had her hopes up. Hold that, honey. Waste not, want not. Listen, Maury, why don't you come by tonight... ...and explain to Barbara what a squirrel cage it was? - I got a date. - Bring her along. I don't think Barbara would appreciate her. - Why not? - It's my landlady. Sharon Kensington. What's the matter? - His... - His daughter, yeah. This is great, Maury. - Get her to drag him down to Houston St. - She hates him. There's a part, Maury, and this is the chance to get it. - What are you talking about? - I'll bring her along. Listen, I'll see you tonight, huh? Don't forget and not bring her. - Sam? - Yeah. I just laid down to take a nap. - Hm-hmm. - Hello! Oh, hello, dear. - You're certainly in a good mood. - It's our anniversary, isn't it? - And I've got great news. - What? You've heard of Robert Kensington, the producer? - Yes. - Well, Maury Novak knows his daughter. We're going to get her to get Kensington down to a performance. Oh... I thought maybe the news was more tangible. - Oh, Sam. - Yeah. - Sam, I've got good news. - What? Come on, never mind. Out! Out. Out, out! - You gotta build a suspense, eh? - Uh-huh. - Honey, do we have a corkscrew? - Uh, in the top drawer of the dresser. And guess who's in town? - Marjorie and Alan Burke. - How did you guess? Well, they're the only people from Lansing we know who ever come to New York. - There's some sort of... - Annual Wholesales Convention. They want to take us to a supper club. I brushed your blue suit. Honey, where... I can't find the corkscrew. - What do you want a corkscrew for anyway? - The cork in the wine bottle. Wine? What are you talking about? Barbara, you look beautiful. I haven't worn this dress since the last time Marjorie and Alan were in town. I know. You mean you plan to see them tonight? - Uh-huh. - We can't, Barbara. I invited Maury Novak and he's bringing Sharon Kensington. - But Sam, this is a real party. - So is this, honey. I can't put on my pink dress and sit around here with someone who I... Barbara, Barbara, don't you see what's important? Sharon Kensington... But not on our anniversary. It's a year today. - We can't, Barbara. Maury is... - Oh, Maury. What about Alan Burke? - He was your best friend in Lansing. - We're not in Lansing now, honey. Well, if friendship doesn't mean anything to you, Sam Lawson, does it mean anything to you at all that I'd like to have a little fun for a change? Alright, honey. We'll go. I'll call Maury. He'll understand. Am I a terrible problem to you? Yep. I'll call Maury. Hey, honey, where's the pictures? I told you it would take a while to have them developed. I want you to see if you can speed it up, huh? What do you say? Thank you, sir. I'll have them in a jiffy. Atta baby. Alan, I wish you'd let me take care... No, none of your confederate money here, boy. I told you the party's on me. So I said, this is positively the last time. Well, it just teaches you never to say this is the last time about anything. - Because here I am. Pregnant again. - I think it's wonderful. You know, the indians had the right idea. Keep them pregnant in the summer and barefoot in the winter. You must be terribly happy. Hey, what about you, Sambo? Got a little stranger on the horizon? No, no, I'm afraid not. - Not even a glint in Poppa's eye? - Alan, stop that! Well, let's get with it, boy. We're gonna have to get more men on the job. That's crude without being funny. Barbara, I am happy about the baby. But I wished it was all over. At this stage I feel like I'm in a Chinese torture chamber. The gas is so bad. Hey, Sambo, come here, will you? You girls talk about books or something. I got some business with my old buddy here. Listen, you old villain, I got a proposition for you. I could use a good salesman, what do you say? You mean me? Let's cut out the hogwash. We're old horse thieves together you and I. Now give me a straight answer, huh? How've you been doing? - Well, things are a little tough now... - Hey, this is Alan you're talking to. I have very high hopes, Alan. - Here we are. - Oh, good. You folks should all be in pictures. - Speak of the devil. - That'll be a dollar apiece, please. One more. Barbara, give me some money. A dollar apiece. Here honey, buy one for yourself. Oh, thank you, sir. I tell you you're money's no good here, you rascal. I'm buying everything. Is that a deal? Let's shake on it. What do you say? Come on, Barbara, we're going home. - But it's early. - Come on, Barbara. I'll call you tomorrow, Marjorie. I don't see why you have to run off now. It's a shagged evening. - Thanks, Alan. Yeah, but the night's on me. I may be broke, but I'm not a charity case. Come on, Barbara. You should relax and try to have some fun. Is it fun to see Alan Burke throw as much money away on one evening... ...as it costs us to live in two weeks. Don't be envious, Sam. And then he tries to slip me money under the table. Maybe you should have kept it. I didn't mean that. I just mean money is money. Marjorie dressed up to the ears... ...and you in that pink formal you wore to the senior prom. - That's my lookout. - It's my lookout too, I'm your husband! Then do something about it. Sam! Oh, boy! Oh, this is Sharon Kensington. How do you do, Sharon? It certainly is nice to... Sharon! - He said he was your friend. - Oh, come on. Oh, hi, Barbara. - Sharon, this is my wife, Barbara. - Hi. Come on in, honey. Maury, how did you get in? Oh, I never turned in my key, roomie. You were expecting us, weren't you? Oh, sure, sure. Make yourself comfortable, will you, Maury. - Would you like a drink, Sharon, huh? - I'm forbidden to have another drink. Sharon. It's part of my instructions for the evening, isn't it? - I can do everything except be myself. - That'll be enough. Just be quiet. If I get a kiss. - Sharon, would you like some wine? - Wine? - How sweet! - No! Wine, honey, wine! That's not a drink. - This is very hospitable of you, Saul. - Uh, Sam. - Sam. - Uh-huh. - Sam? - Sam. Oh, what a lovely name. I love that name. You know, the first man I ever completely destroyed was named Sam. He's s hairdresser now. Um... well... Here's to all of us. You know, you're really nice. I could tell when I kissed you that you were nice. That's still the only foolproof way to judge a person's character. Don't be mad anymore, Maury. Oh, shut up. Isn't he perfect? He has only one flaw, though. - He won't drink. - I've got enough problems. And I'm very suspicious of anyone who won't drink. Aren't you? Aren't you? I mean, it's as though they're afraid of what might come out. I believe you're right. I'll have a glass of that wine, Sam. Oh, good, Barbara. Sharon, Barbara and I were talking about your father and his new play. And I went down to see him about it and he said I was right for one of the parts. I believe you are. The brother, or something. Yeah, that's right. We were thinking if you could get him down... to the Actors' Rostrum some night this week... Get my daddy out of midtown Manhattan? The gargoyle? I know. "Son, I go that far downtown, I get the bends." Maury, that's great! I don't go uptown either. Get about 59th St. and my nose bleeds. That's Daddy alright. That's the gargoyle. That's Kensington right to the teeth. That's a great imitation, isn't it, Barbara? Huh? Sorry I can't appreciate it. But I've never met Mr. Kensington. Well you have now, cookie. You're marvelous. I know he'd enjoy it, Sharon. Once he got down there I know he would. I just think it's a marvy idea. I think Daddy should go down... ...and bring it uptown and we'll all be rich, rich, rich! You're nutty! - Then will you marry me, Maury? - You're real nuts. If it happens, will you marry me? I'm serious, Maury! Will you? Hey, you are serious, aren't you? - Yes, I am. Promise me you'll do it. - Oh, Sharon. If it runs as long as that hit you were in? - Crocodile Tears? - Yes, Crocodile Tears. Then will you do it? - Will you marry me, Maury? - Alright, I'll marry you. Hey, Barbara, did you know that Maury was once in a play that was a real hit? Yes, Sam, you've told me a thousand times. Three hundred and sixty-eight performances it ran. What's it like, Maury? Tell Barbara what it's like to be in a real hit. Oh, it's nice. Crocodile Tears was nothing but a farce, you know. But still there was something different about it. Something fresh. It was like you worked in a small town where... skilled craftsmen and a few artists got together... ...and made a special kind of pottery that was made nowhere else in the whole world. Of course later on Hollywood took it and made four others just like it. But still it was a wonderful feeling to know that you were in... ...at the beginning where they made the original piece of pottery. It was wonderful. Isn't he marvelous? - How long did it run, Maury? - 368 performances. Forty-four and a half weeks. And you haven't worked in a year and a half since? No, Barbara, you're right, I haven't. Well, you'll have to excuse me. But I'm suddenly appalled, I'm just appalled. Barbara, please. You don't need to do this. I'm sorry! I come from a world where you don't even get a vacation till after you've worked a year. Let's be honest, Maury. Wouldn't it be a lot more practical if you just got a good steady job making pottery? Hm, and that was on one glass of wine. She could start a war on a hooker of bourbon. We'd better go, Sam. Thank you for everything, Barbara. It was nice of you to come over, Maury. Sharon, it was very nice meeting you. You're sweet. And the best time to bring your father to a performance... ...would be the beginning of the week before he casts his play. Well, I'm afraid we're gonna have to skip the possibility... ...of him seeing it this week, Sam. - Why? - I didn't want to spoil the party, but... ...the Actors' Rostrum is gonna be dark. We didn't even make the rent. Oh, no! Well, don't worry, Maury, we'll bounce back. The week after that, or maybe even the one after that. Sure, but I'm afraid you'll have to pounce without me. You know that Hollywood job I was talking about? Well, it came through. Dialogue director. - Maury, that's great. - Well, it might lead to better things. Yeah, Maury, it will. It will. - Good night, Sam. - Good night, good night. Sam... I just love that name. Do you know that the first man I ever completely destroyed was named Sam? We know, he's a hairdresser now. Come on. I've been to better parties, I'll say that. So that's the end of the Actors' Rostrum. Not necessarily. - Just because Maury quit the group. - Too bad. You could have had so many delightful evenings... ...with Maury and your friend Sharon. Oh now, Barbara, are you jealous? Is that it? I'm not jealous of anything except that she can eat whenever she wants to. What is it, Sam? Is it a disease? Well, you can call it that, but for me it's my life. It's the thing I want most. And you call it a disease. And you really didn't mean it when you said you wouldn't marry anybody but an actor. Let me think about that. Let me walk out into the terrace of my penthouse apartment and think about that. Barbara, I hate this, don't you see that? I f... I feel terrible every day I come home... ...and realize that I haven't come through for you. So I just keep trying. But now all I can do is say I'm sorry! Oh, Sam, let's go home! - Oh, Barbara... - Not for my sake... ...but for yours. In Lansing they respect you. Everybody likes you. Get a good job. But don't throw your life here on something that doesn't care whether you live or die. - Barbara, this is my life. - Well, it isn't good enough, Sam. It isn't good enough! It isn't good enough! - If that's the way you want it... - It isn't good enough for our baby! Barbara. I didn't know for sure until today, I... I wanted to tell you tonight when we were out with Marjorie and Alan. I wanted for once to have something to contribute. Sam, I want to be alive too. Don't be unhappy, please don't be unhappy. When? Not for a long time yet. Oh, be happy, sweetheart, it's a baby. It's like something holy happening to us. Barbara, honey... You've got to give me one more month to try and get a job, that's all I ask. And if I don't make it... ...we'll go home. Alright, Sam. Who is it? - Miss Drake? - I can't see anyone today. You'll have to have an appointment. If I could just have a minute, Miss Drake. A minute. I just might give you a minute's worth of truth... ...that would be very painful. This is just the day for it. I've got to talk to you. This is my last chance. Now look, would you please... Have you been in here before? I spoke to you once just for a moment. My name is Sam Lawson. I was wondering if there were any replacements coming up in any of the shows. I am going to help you. - Miss Drake! - Go back home. - I can't. - Why not? Because I belong here in the theater. Oh, yes, yes, I know. You're going to be a great star some day. Well, that isn't what's important, but people do become stars. People escape from submarines too. Isn't the writing on the wall? I just haven't been able to get my foot in yet, like with you. I wrote you, and I called you. But I wasn't able to see you until today. Well now you see me. What makes you think anyone's going to pay 4.80 to see you? - You mean I don't look like Eric Peters. - Exactly. But I can act. They wouldn't pay 55c to see you at the Actors' Rostrum. I know, I know. - How did you know we charged 55c? - I saw you. - Well, how wa... - How were you. - Yeah. - You were good. You lack experience, of course, but you have talent. I had talent. A lot of it. For three straight seasons I went from one show to the other. Never missed a paycheck. Then, for two years, almost three, I didn't work at all. Not one single week. But I have to eat. And so does Agnes, and so does Elvira. Elvira'a my mother. I don't like her very much, she doesn't like me very much. Agnes is my mother's cat. I don't like her and she hates me. That's what's left. After all the pay envelopes and all the curtain calls. You saw Kensington? They're all cast. They're going into rehearsal next Monday. They need an assistant stage manager who can understudy and do a bit. Kensington owes me a favor. That's great! I shouldn't waste a favor like this. Go on. He's probably at the theater. I'll call him there. Now listen, I can't promise anything, but go on. Well go on! I knew there was a job. I knew you did. You could almost smell it, couldn't you? Barbara! Barbara! Barbara, it happened! It actually happened, I got a job in the theater, honey. Honey, what is it? What's the matter? He said it wasn't even a baby yet. What? I was just walking along the street. A police car took me to the hospital. Barbara, what happened? I lost the baby. He said it wasn't even a baby yet. - What a terrible thing to say. - Honey, honey. I'm sorry. I love you so much. I'll take care of you, Barbara. Sam, I'm going back to Lansing. Barbara, we don't have to go home now. I'm going to take care of you. I've got a job in the theater. That's what's really important to you, isn't it, Sam? That's what you really care about. Trust me, Barbara, trust me. This is for both of us. It can be the beginning. The real beginning. It's always the beginning. We're always right on the verge. Sam, I don't know you. I don't think I've ever known you. Barbara... It can't end like this, not us. Who said anything about another war? All I said was that we must do something immediately to strengthen our defense. Alright, take a five-minute coffee break. - Lawson. - Yeah? Here, Sam, it's your notice. Now look, Jimmy... Jimmy, I don't understand. Tell me why? Sorry, Mr. Kensington's orders. But I thought your agent told you. No. No, she didn't. I can't talk to you any longer, Mother. Yes... yes, I'll call you back just as soon as I can. What happened? What is this? I show up for rehearsal and I find another actor reading my lines, doing my pieces of business? - Sam, I'll explain it to you. - But I don't understand! Sam, I'll explain if you'll just listen! Look, Kensington did me a favor and gave you the job. A friend of his, an old friend, was out of work. - There are favors and favors. - I'm not blaming the actor. I know you're not. He needs the money very badly. He has a wife and child. That puts him two upon me. I'm sorry, I didn't know. Kensington feels badly. He wants to make amends. He's sending out a road company a party favor. They pay you starvation wages but I thought you might be interested. For what part? Cop. Understudy of the second lead. Cop. Where's it going? Everywhere. They open in Los Angeles, the Biltmore Theater. Maury Novak's with one of the studios out there. He's directing now. - He could make me pick up some work. - Sure, why not? They come back across the country. Denver, Kansas City, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Chicago... Where else? Detroit is the closest they get to Lansing, Michigan. Tell him I'll take it. Alright, Sam. Well, thanks, Shirley. You've made a traveler out of me. U.S. tour. I'll miss you. Me too. I'll send you a palm tree. Yes? I'd like to see Maury Novak. My name is Sam Lawson. You don't have an appointment. Well, just tell him I'm here. I'm sure he'll see me. Well, I'm sorry. Mr. Novak can't see anyone without an appointment. Take a chance and call him. I can't interrupt him now, he's in conference. Now look, all you have to... Mr. Novak, I don't know how to thank you. Oh, you'll find a way. Sam Lawson! - Maury! - How are you? - Good, Maury. Good to see you. - Good to see... You got a few minutes? I'm going over to the Eric Peters set. Why don't you come along, we'll chew the fat. - Swell, wonderful. - I'll be on stage 4 if LJ calls, huh? Oh, you people don't mind waiting just a few more minutes? - Oh, that's all right. - Thank you, thank you. - We'll wait, Mr. Novak. - Let's go. Well, this is the new Eric Peters picture. Eric Peters. - Isn't he a client of Shirley Drake's? - Used to be. He has four agents now. And a personal manager... and a psychiatrist, and a lawyer, and tax counsel... - And an ulcer. - I'm sure. Buddy, he's the hottest new property in the industry today. You know I've been trying to talk him into going back to Broadway and doing a play? That's him. Alright, quiet please. This will be a picture. Let's have a red light. Turn them over. Speed! Action. Gunshot! Cut! Cut! That was beautiful! Yummy, Eric, just yummy. Now watch for next month's issue of Screen Rates, won't you. - Oh, you're too kind, dear lady. - Chair! Chair for Mr. Peters. Hello, Pinky. How's the world's greatest agent? Hello, Maury. By the way, which of those takes did you like best? Oh, the third one. The third one had a lot of fire, Eric. That's interesting. We only did two. Eric, this is Sam Lawson. Eric Peters. - How do you do? - Pinky Bonaparte. - Hi. - Hi. Come on, angel, you got a publicity date. Your fan club from Sacramento. Thirty-five screaming broads just waiting to bite your T-shirt off. Fine. You see, I'm just in the mood to bite back. Eric, by the way, how did you like that playscript I sent you? Any time you want me to direct you in it, just say the word. Novak, you're a traitor. Trying to bury my boy in New York for a whole year? So long. Oh, goodbye. Bye-bye. Eric. - It's amazing. - What is? They're both left-handed. Yeah, let's get out of here, Sam. Sam, I'll get Eric Peters in a play if it's the last thing I ever do. And it'll be the biggest hit Broadway ever saw. Sam, it's been great, really great. Oh, listen, Maury, I got a chance tonight and tomorrow night to play the second lead in our show. I'd like you to come down and see it. We're down at the Biltmore in Los Angeles. I live by one rule, Sam. I never go down into Los Angeles. - Makes your nose bleed? - That's about it. Look, Sam... - Mr. Novak! - Yeah, Honey? - Mr. Novak, LJ's been trying to reach you. - Be right with him. Look, next time you're in town you stay with me, you understand? You stay in a hotel and I'm going to be insulted. - Mr. Novak! - Yes... And give my best to Barbara. - It was Barbara, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Are there any messages for me? - No messages. - Hey, Lawson... - Yeah? You've got company here. Mr. Lawson, Sam Lawson? Yeah. - What's this? - Summons. Divorce action. Good night. Oh, say, I loved your show. It was real funny. It was all I could do to keep from laughing right out loud. Yeah. Me too. Sambo, you old horse thief. Oh, Sam, you were wonderful! - Well! How are you? - Thirsty. I adored the clothes. - Good to see you, demon. How's it going? Well, I expected Barbara to be here. Instead I got this. Yeah, we heard about this. It's too bad, Sam. Is there anything we can do, boy? Just name it. Well, at least let us buy you a drink. I'll let you buy me a thousand, Alan. I'll be down in a minute. I've got that. Yes, I'll hang on, Miss Drake. Um, Sam Lawson to see Miss Drake. There's a gentleman here to see you named Sam Lawson. Miss Drake... Miss Drake? - Miss Drake! - Sam, it's really you! Shirley, this is something. I haven't had such a greeting since the liberation of Paris. It's just that I'm so glad to see you. It's been over a year. How are you? How was the road tour? I saw America. How've you been? How's Agnes? - Oh, she died six months ago. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry. Oh, no, Agnes was the cat, Elvira's my mother. Oh, that's better. How is she? She's fine. She's got a new cat, Constance. Now, Constance hates me worse than Agnes ever did. Oh, Sam... Sam, let's have lunch tomorrow and talk ourselves out, huh? - Fine. - I can't today... ...I've got Maury Novak in there. He's doing the new Kensington play and I'm in on the casting, thank heaven. - You mean the Eric Peters play. - Oh, no. He couldn't get Eric Peters. We're looking for somebody else now. Sam... Sam, you'd be perfect! Oh, no... No, no, Shirley... Maury and I are... Sam, listen, this is a wonderful opportunity. - Come on. - No, Shirley, no... Come on. Please. Oh, thanks, Marie. Mr. Novak, you remember Sam Lawson? Well, well, he's there, he's there, he's there... Oh! - Hi, Sam. - Hello, Maury. I was thinking Sam might be right for the lead. Yeah, yeah, not a bad notion at all. Yeah, let's talk about it. You remember Sharon Kensington, don't you? Sure, sure, you brought her over to the apartment once. Well, I'm going to meet her over at O'Malley's for some cocktails at 5:30. I thought she was married and lived out west somewhere. She was, Texas. But she divorced him. She couldn't stand being away from NYC. Her psychiatrist is here, you know. Why don't you come on along? You know how women are... They're always late, especially Sharon. - And we'll have time to talk. - Fine. - See you Monday, Shirley. - Any time. Here's to the new play. I'll take your good wishes on the play, Sam. I want to open Christmas night and get great notices, you know why? I got a new contract coming up with the studio first of the year. I want to take those notices and beat my salary up so high... that every once in a while they'll have to let me do a script... ...like Flame at Dawn just to keep me from being unhappy. - Now, does that sound backwards? - Uh-uh. You know, an expensive guy costs a lot more when he sulks. I still like good pottery, Sam, more than ever. Nothing else really counts much. It's nice to see the theater can still be of use. By the way, how's things with you? How's Barbara? - It is Barbara, isn't it? - Yes, Barbara. She's fine. - I just got a call from her at Christmas. - Where is she? In Lansing. She just had a baby, according to her card. - I didn't even know she... - Yes, she married an awfully nice guy. Got an automobile agency. Does pretty well. - She was a nice girl. - Yes, she was. Maury... About the play. When do you plan to go into rehearsals? Oh, not for six or seven months, if then. I'd love to read for you. If I'm right. You're right alright. Perfect age, everything. That would be great, Maury. I mean us working together again. - Two more, Charlie. - Yes, sir. I'd love to have a copy... a copy of the script over the weekend. To study it, you know. - When do you plan to hold the readings? - It isn't set yet. Well, it'll have to be pretty soon, won't it, if you're leaving for the coast. Sam, about the play... We're old friends, right? Can I level with you? You mean like the old joke? Can you stand a little honest criticism, you're fired? - No jokes, Sam. - Okay, level. I'm not gonna ask you to read for me because you wouldn't get the part. Well why not? This stuff evaporates in the open air, you know? The part needs a name, Sam, a star. Like Eric Peters? Eric Peters earns $4.000 a week. Oh, come off it, Maury, nobody, absolutely nobody earns $4.000 a week. - But the part needs a... - The part doesn't need a star, Maury Novak needs a star. - An insurance policy against failure. - Will you get off my back? Stop chipping away at me. That's what you're, chipping, chipping, chipping! If that's the way you feel about it, I'm sorry. Don't bug me! Let's just forget the whole thing. I'll see you around. Don't go, please. I apologize. It's this stuff. Try me, Maury. - This part could do wonders. - I can't. What the hell is my career? A shuttle train to nowhere? I can't get a part because I'm not a star. I'm not a star because I can't get a part. - That's right. - Then how am I going to make it, Maury? Maybe you're not going to make it, maybe you haven't got it. I have, Maury, I've got talent and you know that. Talent? Talent's not what I'm talking about. That's what you start with. I'm talking about that extra whatever it is that takes to get you off the shuttle. The con, the moxie, the chutzpah, whatever you want to call it! I know what you mean, the politics, the office manner, the cocktail party line... I can't do it, I've never been able to do it. - Then learn or get out. - But when there's a part... No. No. Sam, try and understand. I'm gonna do better than that, Maury. I'm gonna try and learn. - Mr. Novak... want this other drink? - Oh, I've got no use for it now. Is anything the matter? How do you like that for a friendly gesture? He stole my coat. Mr. Kensington's apartment is K. The left. Thanks. - Is Mr. Novak here? - He's not in. Um, excuse me. Is Mr. Kensington here? No. Well, this is Mr. Novak's coat. He's got mine. - Would you have him send it to... - Maury, is that you, you miserable dog? Hello. I'm Sam Lawson. I got Maury's coat by mistake. There was a script addressed from here care of Kensington. It was in the pocket. Where is he? I know where he was. Come in. Well come on in! Yosho, you bring us some more ice. Do you know how to make a scotch and soda? Hm-hmm. You're perfect... So far. There's the bar over there. - Where was he? - O'Malley's restaurant. You're lying. He had a date to meet me there at 5:30... ...and he didn't show up. Well, he was there until six and I didn't see you. Well, what's half an hour? Wouldn't you wait half an hour? I'd wait. You're sweet. I think Maury got drunk. Well, you must be a good influence on him. He had to get drunk so he could tell me I'm not going to make it. Are you going to make it? Yes... I am. Good. - Is it double? - Yes, ma'am. I've been drinking doubles all day. It isn't good to switch. I thought you went to see your psychiatrist. No... No, I canceled the appointment. I called up my doctor and I really hit him where it hurt. I called him up and I said, doctor... I don't believe that I'll be able to come in for my appointment today... ...because my horoscope says I can't leave the house. They're all alike. - Who? - You too, probably. Isn't that awful now? Here I just met you and I'm being so mean to you already. I met you a long time ago. I feel awful but I don't... I don't remember you. I remember you. Well don't tell me what I said or did. Oh, I get the cold chills about anything I ever I said or did. Oh, you said nothing, did nothing wrong. You're sweet. And if you're lying, I don't want to know about it. So you can talk about the future all you want, but please don't talk about the past. Okay. What are you going to do with your future? Well, I think that I'll drink scotch and... ...I'll smoke cigarettes and I'll be very good at it. Is that all? Don't! I make all the passes. You make the drinks. Do you realize that on English ships... ...you can buy the best scotch whisky there is in the whole world for $1.65 a fifth? I'd imagine. What do you say that you and I take a trip around the world on an English ship? And we'd sit in the bow with a pitcher of ice water... ...and a fifth of scotch apiece? And we'd just see everything. - There must be something to see. - Miss. Phone for you. I told you, Yosho, I'm not home to anybody... ...but my psychiatrist or that man from the liquor store. It's Mr. Novak. Maury... Maury, hello. Maury! Maury, answer me! Maury, answer me, you miserable rat! Maury, why don't you answer me? Alright, alright, not so loud. You got the phone going for you. Why did you stand me up this afternoon, because you couldn't stand up? Oh, I'm sorry, darling, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, I... What made you think I was drinking? Maury, don't be that way. Maury, don't be that way. I need you. You don't need me, baby. You need a sanitarium. Oh, that's cruel, Maury, that's cruel. Just because I had one little drink? Well, that's one over the limit for you. Maury, why don't you come over? Why don't you come over, Maury? I promise you I won't take another... What's the point, baby? By the time I got there... ...you'd be seeing double and I don't think you could handle two of me. Maury, don't hang up! Mau... Maury! Maury! Sharon. - Sharon, come on. - No... - I'm not gonna cry over that miserable... - That's right, that's right. It's not worth it. It's just not worth it. Kiss me, Sam. I told you I made all the passes. That's right. You did. Sam! I trust that you'll be comfortable, sir. I believe that you and your lovely bride... ...will find the honeymoon suite most pleasant. Sam! Thank you. The gargoyle wants to talk to you. Hey you, not so fast. Come here, I got something for you. Hello, Mr. Kensington. You're in very mediocre company, my friend. Sharon's first husband was the worst office-boy I ever had. When she was in Mexico divorcing him she met a no-good pup who ran a 21 game. He was her second husband. The last one was a rich moron. An oil-rich moron. You like the company? - I hear you're an actor. - I worked for you once. Yes, so I hear. I don't remember you but... I know actors. I know them and I hate them. Now look, boy... You have no idea what it takes to make a success in this business. I know. I made one. But I did it by sweat and by labor, not by marrying the boss's daughter. And if you think that'll do it, you're sadly mistaken, my friend. Not while I'm the boss. All you get is very sadly mistaken. I bet he wants to kill us both, doesn't he? Now you take this telegram out tonight for me, do you understand? Right away, right away. It's the most important message ever sent. - Ever sent. - Maury? Yes. As a special engraved wedding announcement. Oh, I'd just give the world to see his rotten face when he reads it. I'd just give the world. I hope so, Sam. I hope it makes him... I hope it makes him cry. Well then, aren't you going to carry me across the threshold? Well, husband? Aren't you going to do that thing? Aren't you going to carry me across the threshold? Sure I am. I don't think you'd make it any other way. Thanks, Marie. The sponsors already signed these radio contracts. You want to look them over? Did you get the clause about the right to take four weeks off... ...for an out-of-town tryout if I should get a play? Hm-hmm. But that was a tough one. The radio people don't like that. I think it gives them an inferiority complex. I wouldn't have gotten it at all if Kensington hadn't... If Kensington wasn't my father-in-law? I wouldn't even have a job if Kensington wasn't my father-in-law. You got a pen? - How's Constance? - The cat? - Hm-hmm. - Oh, she's fine, thriving. Mother's not well, though. She broke her hip. Hm... that's tough. I don't know when she'll ever get out of bed. Sam. Congratulation on your anniversary. You've been married a year today. "Sharon Kensington Lawson. She's his daughter... and hubby Sam, he's lead on Man of America, an up-and-coming radio drama produced by Pop-In-Law for Regal Foods, are celebrating one year married in the silliest way. He's in New York, she's been in Hollywood the past three months... dangling from the arm of Maurice Novak, screen megaphoner. Hm. Hm is spelled "H-m-m-m-m". Shouldn't write things like that. People seem to like to read them. I didn't mean to hurt you, Sam. Nobody can resist being catty once in a while. That item doesn't mean a thing. Sharon wanted a vacation, Maury's an old friend, they'll print anything to fill up space. Has Maury cast his play yet? Not yet, but he will be soon. - Interesting. - Sam. Yeah? Listen. I'm part agent and part old friend. You've been talking to the agent. Can the old friend say something? Uh-huh. I've seen you when times are tough but I've never seen you like this. - Shirley, I... - Sam, you're gonna listen to me. You're miserable and I know why. You're a good human being but you've stepped out of character. From the day you married Sharon... ...you became the worst thing a person can be, a self-deciever. Self-deciever? Oh, that's the last thing I am. Now wake up, Shirley. The whole world's full of people who'd give anything to sell their souls to the devil. The only trouble is the devil doesn't want them. That's fine, that's great. You go right ahead and be cynical, that's the easy way. It's the truth. The only difference between me... ...and the rest of the world is that I got off lucky. - The devil has made me an offer. - And has it made you happy? Happy? What kind of a word is that, happy? Who's happy? Are you happy, Shirley? I'm not talking about me. Well maybe it will. Maybe it'll make me very happy. Never! You won't even be a good opportunist. The good ones come by it natural. - Wait and see. - Alright, the old friend's finished. The old friend's wrong. I'll be a good opportunist. Never, never, Sam Lawson. Not as long as you live! At least the agent never had it so good. That wasn't necessary. I'm sorry, Shirley. I don't want you to be sorry, Sam. I don't want you that way. I mean I don't want you to be th... Sam. Sam. Sharon? What are you doing here? I just got in. - Well, how are you? - Fine, thank you. How's Hollywood? - It's alright. - Have a suntan? - Sort of. - I'll try and catch up. There's something I want to talk to you about. I didn't want to write to you. I want to tell you in person. I want a divorce. Did you hear what I said, Sam? I want a divorce. I know this hasn't been very nice for you... ...and I know that I haven't been the greatest wife in the world. But if you can please forgive me. Are you forgetting a vow you made about matrimony? A vow you broke. You flatter me greatly if you think I can be the one to forgive you for that. I know that. I now I was wrong but I want to start being right. And just how do you propose to accomplish that monumental feat? Sam, I'm going to have a baby. Maury? Yes. I'm in love with him, Sam. For the first time in my life, and maybe the only time, I'm in love. Maybe it's the baby, I don't know. Maybe I've finally gotten proof that I'm a woman. And to be in love is not something I don't deserve. That's straight from the psychiatrist's mouth. Well it's true! - It's always been Maury. - Yes it has. And now he wants me. Wake up, Sharon, you know Maury. It's not you he wants, it's his child. The most important A-number-1 piece of pottery in his whole life. He wants it. And he wants it so bad he's willing to buy the oven. Now that's the truth and you know it. I don't care why he wants me. He wants me. And that's the only thing that matters to me now. This time it's different. Yes it is. This time it's completely different. There's a whole new ingredient, Sam. It isn't compromise, it isn't convenience... And it isn't sex, it's love. Sam, I used to think there wasn't such a thing. But now I know that I just forgot it. Like a hope you give up on till you suddenly feel it again. Sam, you can understand hope, can't you? Yes... Yes, I can understand hope. Thank you. Thank you, Sam. I knew you'd understand. No divorce. Oh, Sam, don't say that. No divorce. Oh Sam, please. Please, Sam, anything you want. Anything at all, there's no ceiling. - Sam... - No divorce. This is my last chance, Sam! I beg you! Don't, Sharon. Don't beg him. You can't get a favor by begging. You want something in return, don't you? And there's nothing Sharon can give. You know, eventually she can divorce you even if you won't go along with it. Time is of the essence. The two of you made it that way. What is it? Money? Hollywood? You want me to open doors? Okay, you can play the part in the show. Come on, Sharon, let's get out of here. You learned, didn't you, Sam? I had a good teacher. You... you've disobeyed my orders coming up here. I knew you'd be here and I knew you'd be alone. Excuse me, Jimmy. Maury... Is this where I make the first move toward him where I grab him? Yeah, right here to begin the fight scene. - Okay, let's try it again. - I'll give you the cue. Alright. Alright, let's call it a day. 10:00 tomorrow morning. - How's Lawson doing? - Oh, he's gonna be great. I'm going across the street to O'Malley's get myself a blast. You coming? No, I got a couple of chores to do first. I'll wait for you out in the alley. This place smells like a theater. That fight scene still needs work, Maury. - I'll go over it tonight. - That won't be necessary. - Okay, but when we get back to it... - You and I won't get back to it, Sam. What are you talking about? I'm replacing you. - What is this, a gag? - It's no gag. Eric Peters is available. He had a fight with his studio and I'm bringing him in from California. Look, Maury, I can be great in this part. I'm bringing Peters in. So this is the double-cross. Sharon goes to Reno, I hold up my end of the deal and now you back out. - Was this the plan all along? - No. Or did you get the idea when you received that telegram... ...announcing the availability of that star of stars Eric Peters? I've been thinking about this all week. If you want the truth, the fight scene in the first act curtain... The fight scene's going to be great, Maury. - I didn't believe it. - Don't, Maury, don't you give me that. Now you tell me the truth. You tell me how those Hollywood producers are going to come running to Maury Novak... ...when they hear he's got the prize of the year. When they hear he's got Eric Peters. The biggest movie name in America to star in his new play. Well, I'm backing out too, you see? I'm going to... I'm going to fight that divorce till you're both old and grey. Okay, fight. Here, two thousand bucks. That's a starter. Whatever else you need, I'm good for it. Oh, that fixes everything, doesn't it? That preserves your precious integrity. And I hope this is the biggest hit in history. You're on a run-of-the-play contract and you can collect your salary every week. That's conscience money, Maury. To make you forget you're a dog. - I don't have to listen to this. - Oh, you're slipping, Maury. You can't look me in the eye when you put the knife in. You didn't believe the fight scene! You're a liar! I'm the boss! Maury! I'm gonna kill you. Do you hear me, I'm gonna kill you. You won't know where, or when, or how, but it's going to happen, do you hear me? I'm gonna kill you! I swear it, I'm gonna kill you! I'll kill you, Maury! - I'll kill you! - Stop! You hear me, I'll kill you! What's the matter with you, Sam? Have you gone crazy? Don't you recognize the first act curtain speech from your won play? Yeah... Hey, that is the first act curtain speech, isn't it? How about me being taken in like that? You sure had me going. You know, a whole audience bites like that we got a grand slam. I feel better about the whole operation, Maury. But boy, you sure started the old adrenaline going. Could I use that drink now! How about it? - Yeah, I'll join you. - Sam? No, no thanks. You know, I should have put some of my own money into this one. Hurry it up. The management's buying. He believed it, Maury. Everybody out! Hello, Carl. Has Sam Lawson been here? No, Miss Drake, he's been replaced. I know. But I thought he might have left some word. If you do see him, tell him to get in touch with me right away, it's very important. Yes, Miss Drake, I'll tell him. Well, for goodness' sake, where have you been? I've been all over looking for you and calling you. Why don't you answer your phone? What is all of this? I was going to stop by to see you before I left. You don't have to go anywhere. I've got you a job. Well what's so funny? Now isn't that a coincidence? Just today. Just when I get another offer and I get to do my specialty. What are you talking about? You know, Shirley, a specialty, like singing, dancing, telling fortunes, doing card tricks. - Stop being flip. What's the job? - And I've got a very special specialty. Going in advance of an artillery batallion and observing, just observing. You're joking. The army spent a lot of dollars teaching me to be observant. Now they're requesting the use of my services. Actually, it's a little stronger than a request. You see, I'm in the reserves. And they say they need me. Voil?. Lieutenant Samuel Lawson, subject: active du... - Oh, Sam, they can't do this to you. - They've done it. It won't be so bad, Shirley. I can't say Korea is a place I've always wanted to visit. But I think after Broadway I'm going to welcome a nice quiet war. Hey, fellas! Have you heard the war's over? Looks like we'll be going home soon, Captain. Yep. Mary, you're going to have a flock of good people to choose from. My vote goes to a guy named Sam Lawson. He's cute. Yeah, that's what the normal healthy American should be. Cute. - He's perfect. And you say he's good? - He's great. Then we don't have to see any more actors. - Call him in. Let's talk to him. - Right. - Mr. Lawson... - Hold it a minute. Before we make any commitments I think we'd better see if he's clear. Well what do you know? Were you ever a communist? Of course I was never a communist. You were with a group called the Actors' Rostrum some years ago down in the village. That had nothing to do with being a communist. I never even knew a communist. - You knew Maurice Novak. - Of course I knew... Maury. - Last week a Congressional committee... - I know, I know. I read the newspapers. The studio just cancelled his picture contract. That has nothing to do with me. I never joined anything. Nobody can say I did. Well, with the Actors' Rostrum. The agency and the television people found out. Found out? Well, from whom? Who's accusing me? Sam, these are very responsible, patriotic people. They're just trying to protect their country. Oh, Sam. Don't... don't, Shirley. It's not your problem. I'm a big girl now. Suppose you let me be the judge of that. Okay. I never said I understood women. No, you could certainly never make that claim. I'll try to get you a play. Thanks. How's uh... Elvira? My mother? I got her name straight this time. She died several months ago. - I didn't know, Shirley. - Oh, it's... it's the best thing really. I prayed for it. That hip never healed. Alice, the current cat, isn't eating. Looks like I'm finally rid of cats at least. The one bright side. I'll check with you. Oh, Sam. Sam. What are you gonna do? There's only one thing for me to do. Survive. Oh yes, sir. I'm afraid the dining room isn't open yet, sir. - I know, I wanted to ask... - If you'd care to make a reservation... I can accomodate you either before 6:30, sir... ...or after the theater crowd. - If that will be acceptable. - I don't want a reservation. - I want a job. - A job? Yes, sir. Come with me. Good day, sir. Oh, thank you, sir. I hope you enjoyed your lunch, sir. Oh, Charlie, Charlie. Check in my stubs for me, will you? I'm in a rush. And Charlie, if I'm a little late for the supper... Sam, you've been working here quite a while now. Yep. How many flop shows you had in that time? I try to forget flops, Charlie. Well, the boss don't forget them. The flops or the times you're late for work because you had an appointment. Look Charlie, all I'm asking you is if I'm a little late, you try and be a friend and cover for me, okay? - Hm? - Okay. Mr. Lawson! Oh! I'm sorry it didn't work out. - Thanks anyhow for thinking of me. - I wish we could be working together. Actors as good as you are rare. Look, I'll give you a call next play, huh? Thanks, Jack... don't bother. Hi, Sam. Well, what do you say? Nothing, I'm speechless. Shirley told me I'd find you here. How've you been? Employed, thanks. How's Sharon? Pretty well for a woman with two children... ...and a husband that can't work. I'll use my influence with my boss, Maury, if you're interested. I want to talk to you. I'm going to have a job for you, if you want it. You're opening up a restaurant? I'm a waiter now. I heard... I'm gonna do a new play, it's a good play and... you're just right for it. How come? Can't you get a star? I'm not gonna do it uptown. I'm gonna do it down in Greenwich Village. No producer thinks it's commercial enough for Broadway... ...and they're wrong, it's a good play. So you're doing it off-Broadway and you're paying everybody $40 a week. Don't tell me it's the old Seaman's Mission. That's right. Tell me something. Just out of curiosity. Is it true? Were you ever a communist? - Yeah, for a short time. - Why? I never believed in it. Never had a political thought in my head. Then why? There's more than one way to be an opportunist. It served my purpose at the time. Sure it did. - It's a good part, Sam. - No thanks, Maury. I've been had. I'm through grabbing for the bones you toss. There's no meat on them anymore. - But this is different. - I don't need you anymore, Maury. I've got something. Something steady, comfortable and respectable. I've got a job. You like being a waiter? I like getting something in return for what I do, I like that very much! The part I want you for is the star part. Well, I hope your show's a big hit and you bring it uptown... ...to the house next to O'Malley's. It'll be great for our supper business and boost my tips. So I couldn't wish you anything but luck. You don't mean that. I mean it, Maury. I never meant anything more in my life. Sorry, I gotta run now, I'm late for work. May I take your orders? Have you decided on anything, Barb? Waiter, what would you reco... Hello, Barbara. Sam! You two know each other? Matt, this is Sam Lawson, you know... Sam, this is my husband, Matt Helmsley. - Well, how do you do? - How do you do? Gee, this certainly is the small world department. - Yes. - Won't you sit down? Oh, I'm afraid not, rules of the house. Oh, yes, sure... What are you doing in town? Are you seeing shows? Just tonight. We're leaving for Europe tomorrow aboard the Liberty. - Oh. - Libert?, darling. Ahh! Say, how's everything in the show game? You're still in the show game, aren't you? Well, I'm kind of at liberty at the moment. Or at "libert?", you might say. Barbara knows what that means. It means in between engagements. - What would you like to order? - Barb! We'd better get going... ...if we're going to get to that show on time. Oh... yes, we'd better. Well, it was nice meeting you after all these years. Maybe we'll see you again sometime. Yes. Yes, I hope so. I'll, uh... wait for you at the door, Barbara. We probably won't see each other again sometime, you know. I know. But I'm glad this one's happened, Barbara. Yes, so am I. He seems like a very nice fellow. He's a wonderful man. I'm glad, Barbara. I've been very happy, Sam. I have everything I ever wanted. A home, husband, children. I've thought about you many times these past years, Sam. I've wanted to talk to you... to apologize. Oh, there's no need for that, Barbara. I'd like to apologize for not understanding. I do understand now. Everytime I read a book, or see a painting... ...or watch a movie that makes people laugh or cry, I... I think to myself, Now I know what Sam was trying to do. You were trying to contribute... You wanted to give something and... ...the only thing you had to give was yourself. Sam, I'm so proud of you for... ...knowing what you wanted and fighting so hard to get it. Thank you, thank you, Barbara. But I haven't made it, as you can see, I... Knowing you, Sam, I know you haven't settled for this. Now I understand and it all seems so obvious. Maybe that's what understanding is. Discovering the obvious. Poor Matt, he's... he's waiting for me. Goodbye, Sam. And good luck. - I thought they were staying to dinner. - They changed their minds. Sam, where are you going? I'm gonna see a man about a play. Oh, Sam, I thought you saw the point I was trying to make. I did, Charlie, I saw it perfectly. Then stop hurting yourself. Accept what you are. That's just what I'm going to do. Accept what I am. Alright, you got five minutes. Shirley! Shirley Drake. - Hello, Maury. - Hi. - How's Sharon? - Oh, fine. She's over at O'Malley's. Having dinner. I said I'd go and pick her up. Hi, Sharon, I was coming over to get you. - I'm just waiting for Sam. - Oh. Hi, Sam, well... Here it is, the second night, the reviews are all in... Looks like we're going to get a big season out of this. - Looks like it. - Yes, congratulations, Sam. No one ever deserved a success more than you do. Oh boy, success makes everybody friends again. - How about a drink, huh, Sharon? - Maury, you've had enough. I've had enough from the worst of a reformed drunk. Hey, Sam, how about you and me? A little drink after the show, hm? Uh, no thanks, Maury. I'm meeting a friend. Oh... I get the subtle distinction. Well, thanks, Maury, but I never figured I was subtle. - Let me help you. - Ah! Maury, wait. - Hello, Shirl. - Hello, Sam. Listen, I got great news. Kensington agreed to a run-of-the-play contract on our terms. - Good. - Mr. Lawson, we won't go up till we get word from the front of the house. Fine, thank you, Paul. We got a movie offer, the money's awful good... but I think we ought to wait for a specific picture, don't you? Yeah, anything you say, Shirl. Fine. And, let's see now. We've got a... There's a couple of other little things, but I guess they can wait till tomorrow. Uh-hm. Well, I think I'll go home and feed Prudence. - Prudence? - The cat. I thought you finally got rid of cats, Shirley. Well, I did for a while after Mother died... ...and then one day I went out and bought one on my own. I guess I got so used to cats after all those years. It's better than nothing. Something alive around, you know. - Shirl. - Hm? Why don't you go home and feed Prudence, and then after the show... ...maybe we'll go around the corner and get a sandwich or something? And some coffee. I thought you said you had to meet a friend. Don't you qualify? Oh, I hope so. Thank you, Sam. I think that would be very nice. Fine. I'll pick you up. Did you see the marquee? Yes, I did. Why did it take so long, Shirley? You give a wonderful performance. Perhaps a great deal had to happen to you to make it what it is. Shirley? Shirley, what's the matter? It suddenly just seems like... ...so rotten... such an awful one-sided bargain. No life, no family, no home, just existence. And all those precious years for what? A name on a marquee. Places, please. Sam, tell me something. Warning! Curtain! It doesn't matter now, it's over and done with. But tell me, was it worth it? Curtain going up! Was it, Sam? Was it worth it? Yes. Yes, it was worth it. Subtitles: Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
