Look, the trailer is coming. - Everybody I beg you, - Don't mind her. Everybody move. Everybody move. Move. Trailer! Trailer! Won't trailer move by itself. Do you want to stop it from moving? - Calm down - They are gone. Please, leave this place. My sister, come. I can see them as well. - You see? - I see what you're seeing. We know ourselves. Before I was done talking, the three of them disappeared. If not for me, the trailer would have cleared out everyone. Yeah, just like that. Don't worry. Look don't stress yourselves. Where you are now, I have been there too. The same position. God gave you the gift as well? - Yes. So, don't stress yourself. - Just imagine. - Look, let me tell you something. - Father Lord, I thank you for today. - Come on. - You are the God of God. You are the Alpha and Omega. - The beginning and the end. The... - Let me tell you something. See… They are different causes of illusion. - Is that so? - Do you understand? There is crack. There is cocaine. That's for rich people - Do you understand? - Yes. Our kind, Once we take Mali, and we add Colorado, And then we add Loud to it, - Me? - Everything is perfect. Brother, I've never smoked in my life. Brother, didn't you see the three witches? - I'm not lying. - That's what they say. Even I back then, when I used to smoke? Ah! When I smoke it once, I'm on another level. No, I'm not lying. - That's what we say, it's all the same. - I don't smoke. Look. Before this, let me just help you. You see what I'm about to give you now, take See, this thing I want to give you, see them. Make sure you call them. Do you understand? When I had the same issues then. They were the ones that helped me. They were the ones that helped me, and they were fast. Now just take a look at me, all fresh and clean. - Yaba left? - Yes. Just call them, they will take care of you. You think I'm mad? It's not your fault. You all are mad. I just saved your lives and you all think I'm... - You gave me a card for psychiatric home. - Call... God will judge you all. Leave her. What is this? Don't worry, you will learn now. Are you not a ghost? Why didn't you disappear after I... After spreading incense, why didn't you disappear. Technically, I'm not a ghost. "Technically, I'm not a…" Are my eyes seeing double? Or have I gone crazy? No. No, you're not crazy. You understand Yoruba? My name is Amoke. I'm alive but… I'm in a coma. You're in a com... No. What is that? I am alive but I'm not awake. A coma. Comas? What is that? I want you to tell me what it mean? Well, a few days ago, I went to a friend's event. ‎ - Hello? - Hello. - I can't even hear you. Hello? - Hello Hello. Hello. Hello. But I thought I told you not to call me anymore? Stop calling me. Amoke, I'm so sorry. Please. Erm I didn't mean to... That defeats the purpose. Stop calling my phone. - I'm busy, stop calling me. - My God. I said what I said, yes. Bye. Jesus. Hello. I have done it. After seven days, she will die. Unless you have a change of mind before then. It in your hands. ‎ You're a fool! Please, where did you come from? I'm Yoruba, but I was raised in in the states. Which state? Is it... I'm very sure you're from Oyo state, right? - Which state? - No, I as in the United States. - America? - Yes. Amer… that's why you don't have any sense. Go and ask from anyone that knows Isla, It is only two people I can leave my drink with. My husband, and I'm not married yet. And my mother. You don't have sense. You stood up and left your drink. You deserve what you got. So, I'm listening to you. What do you want me to do? Please, I need you to help me find the person that tried to kill me. And reverse this. Whatever this is, reverse it. - Please. - Okay. I'm not interested anymore. - I have changed my mind. - No, please! You need to help me. You need to help, I could die. Let me ask you a question So if you die, what's my business? Am I your father? Answer me, am I your father? - Am I your mother? - Wait! So you mean to tell me that you'd stand by… do nothing and watch me die? Knowing that you are the bridge to help me get to the other side. Oh no. See, you are selfish. You are selfish. The confidence that you have is appealing is flabbergasting. Please. You need… you need to help me, okay. Don't be offended. You have to help me. You have to help me. ‎ That's how you rich people behave. Let me ask you a question. If you were not dead, would you come to my house? Will you have asked me for my help? If you were not dead, and someone like me comes to your house for help, you will ask me to be your gateman or help you do your laundry. It will not be well with you. - How much? - You are... Because, fine, you don't like me… Very okay. So, let's just do business. Okay? That seems to be the language we both understand. Just tell me how much it is, because, I do not have any time. You can see you're not the only one, so if you want it to be fast tracked you have to pay five hundred thousand. Fine. I said five hundred thousand and you said fine. You did not negotiate. Now I understand. You're trying to tell me you are proud. You are a proud person. For what you just did, I change my mind. - Three million - Ah! Okay, you see, you are just selfish and greedy. I have never seen such in my life before. A mad person. Three million. One million. Two point Five million. Two million. Two point three million. Two million. - Two point two. - Two million and... - Two point one. - Two million. - Two million, okay. - Yes. - I agree. - And that's as far as I can go. Five hundred thousand is the deposit that I will make and then when all of this is reversed, I will pay you the rest. Where is the five hundred thousand? It's in my house. May God punish you. We can go together to go and get it. You are crazy. Okay, where is your house? The Island. I live on the Island as well. Where we live is the only difference. How do we get it? We will go there together. I will show you were the money is. It's in a safe in my house, in my room, in my closet. - Finished. - Let me think about it. Isla, why did you keep me waiting? You and these ghosts, your trouble is too much. - Don't be angry. - Get in the car, let's go. - Let's go. - I will rather walk than enter this… casket of a car. Did you hear what this ghost said? - What did she say? - She said our car, chariot of fire… She said it's like a casket and she would rather walk. What about where you are buried. Do they not bury them with caskets? - Isn't she dead? - I'm not dead. - You're not dead, right? No problem. - Woman. Yes. Are you sure there's five hundred thousand in that house? Yes. Isla, ask her. Calm down. - Did you hear that? - Yes. - Swear it? - I swear. - Let's go. - Isla. She doesn't know anything, let's go. She said it's there. - Oh! Are you mad? - You've ruined my face. Well done. Good engine. You just flew out of the car. It's God that gave you the power. Where are we going? Here. Where? My house is right here. What! Is this your house? She said this is her house. This woman is wealthy. How would we get in? The key is behind the statue. Let me just come to you. But she's wealthy! Yes, key. Behind the statue, there. Yes. Won't you lock the car? Until they steal something in the car? Go in now. Why are you making it look like a secret. Wow! Wealth lives here. Ah God! Forget, you are wealthy. This house is so fine. - Thank you. but just... - Amoks, you are wealthy. So wealthy! - Oh my God! - You are so simple and classy. Oh no! - Oh God. - Please, put that down. Put that down. Hello, put that down. Please tell her not to touch anything. Calm down. - Tell her to put that down. - I can't shout. Maka, calm down. She said I should tell you not to touch anything. - Please! - She said please! What kind of thing is that? - She's over here. - Where is she? What's the meaning of that? You're taking me for granted. You have taken me for granted that's why you are talking to me that way. Take a good look at me... ‎ What happened? You are dead now. Do you want to take it to heaven? Please, let's just go upstairs. - Co... - Sorry, don't be angry. I was just trying to... She's not there. You are acting like a mad person. Isn't it your mate that built this house. Who are you calling mad? It's yo… don't be angry. - Don't be angry. - You're misbehaving. She's so wealthy. You're misbehaving. Where are you going. Just stay. - Stop it. - As she's over there, - do you know what I told her? - No. I told her that, if she wasn't dead and a ghost… - What? - We would have killed her. - We would kill her. - We would leave the documents. - The handle of my bag is long. - We would just... We would kill her here. - Stop it, you can die. - We'll hold onto her neck. - Can we please just go upstairs? - No. - We are... - You know you are crazy. - She is over here. - Where is she? - You know what we'll do? - Eh? Just follow my footsteps. She likes to walk, she walks too much. The safe is on the other side. You know that... She said the safe is here, the money is in there. But I'm not... - Isla? - Yes. Is it my eyes or there's no money in this safe? Or is the money also a ghost? I don't understand. No! Who could have done this? No! - No! - Stop shouting. You're shouting in my ears. Who are you acting for? I put the money here. The money was right here. - Who could have done this? - You, you... You can see the reason I didn't want to come along with you. You know I didn't want to answer you. - Please Isla, that's not the issue now. - Who could have been here? No. Who could have been here? Maka, imagine the question? - See, our prayer point should be... - Wait... "God should help us not to meet unfortunate people in this life" Very unfortunate. Look, if I punch you. - If I... - Just concentrate and punch her. - If I punch you. - Just concentrate. Do you think this is a joke? Let's go. You think this is a joke? This is my life. What's my business with that. This is my life. I could die. You think I will come this far just to show you an empty safe? I have everything. Everything that I have worked for. Everything that I hold so dear could be gone. Isla, please. Isla, please. Please. Isla, don't let me die. Please. Please save my life. Please you can save me. I can survive this. Please save my life, the same way that you saved those people at the bus stop. Please. Woman, let's leave… - You're standing like you repented. - Isla please. Please. Please. - Isla please. - Let's leave. Maka, calm down. Why are you telling me to calm down? Where is she? - If I concentrate and punch her - She's not there, she's here. - Where is she? - But you need to calm down. - You know I'm an emotional person. - Please. - Who are you? - What can we do now? Who are the we? I think I know who did this. Please let's leave. Come. Please. Didn't we come here together? Why are you leaving me behind? What's all this? So, where is Ebele, right now? Ebere. She's my former PA. Your former PA? Isn't it the same person you said called you at the party? Yes. Why did you sack her? She slept with my boyfriend. Woman, what's happening? Has she told you were the money is? I'm pissed. I'm in a hurry. Wait. - Stop. - What's happening? Calm down Maka, let her finish. Did she sleep with your husband? Not my husband, my boyfriend. And I trusted her but she betrayed me. Maka? You're really pissed, right? Very hot. I'm pissed. Let's go. Where are we going? I'm going to beat up Ebere. Fine, but we are going to do it my way. - Your way? - Yes. She said we should go. Come and drive. She said we should be going. - My father, she's commanding me - Don't be angry. You both have gone mad. You both are mad. What? What? The people in my world only understand one thing… appearance. Now, if you want easy access to Ebere and her work place… You both going to have to look the part. Take that back! Change what? Can you imagine what she's saying? If we want to go and meet with Ebere, we have to change our look. That people in their world only understand appearance. You, don't understand, let me tell you something. We both are okay like this. Forget it, this isn't mere bragging. - See the Gucci. - Will you shut up. Look… Their mothers! - I will step on the devil. - What is it? It's Gucci from head to toe. Are you cursed? You act too crazy. - What is it? - You act too crazy. Someone wants to help you you are still talking. Even me, who is wearing original Icebox. That I bought for one thousand five hundred, I'm not saying anything. Why are you acting this way? Ladies, shall we? Okay. Where is the place? - There. - There? - Yes. - Where are we going through? - This way? No problem. - That way. Yes. Where is the place? We're here now. Yes. She said it's here, but we can pass here. Let me see the knife. I'm in a hurry. Well done. I will stab her today. Let's go. Good day madam. How may I help you? Take that... We are looking for Ebele. Ebere. Can you speak properly? Ebere. Do you mean Ebere? Do you have an appointment with her? What kind of nonsense is... Yes. We do. Okay. well, she's over there. There? God bless you. I will be there right away. That's her. If you...

You are the one who slept with our friend's husband. - You are th... - Securi... You think we came here to play? She's not the one. You were the one who killed her She's the one. - It's a mistaken identity? - Who? She? - Sorry about that. - What's going on there? - Are you Ebere? - Sorry about that. Are you unfortunate? It will not be well with you. Come here. - Come here. - I don't understand. What kind of question is that? Woman, come over here. - What is wrong with you? - I will... - Are you mad? - You are the one? You are the one who stole our friend's money and killed her. Are you not the one who put her to coma. And you slept with her husband. - Madam - Boyfriend. Ask this... - What did she say? - I'm not dead. - Madam - Okay, go ahead. Madam, ask her if she doesn't know who Amoke is? - You don't know Amoke? - Who is Amoke - What are you talking about. - Who is Amoke? - Who is Amoke? - Amoke has been sick. So what are you talking about? - Are you insane? - Words cannot quantify - the level of embarrassment. - She's speaking English. - Thank you. - Exactly. - Ebere, do you know these people? - She knows us. - I do not know them. - Intimately. - Do I know you? - She knows us intimately. - Ma, I have never met these people - Yes. - It's enough. - She knows us very well. - Stop by HR on your way out. - Physically, Sexually, intimately. - On our way out?

What money are you talking about? What? Are you claiming innocence? Thunder will strike you. Unfortunate person. Anyway, it's your boss that sent us here. What boss are you talking about? Amoke! Me! Amo... That's not possible. Can you imagine, it's not possible because you think you have killed her. Yeah, because she thinks she's dead. She thinks she's dead. Look, Look, as we're talking to you right now, see Amoke over here. No, She's over here. - Looking at the wrong place. - Amoke is here? - Woman, she's over there. - Where is she? How? I don't understand. Talk to her over there. Look, Amoke is here. Her ghost is here, you cannot see her because she's a ghost. She's dead. I'm not dead. A ghost? - I'm not dead - I don't unde...

Just tell her... - Woman, where is the money? - If you touch me again… Are you running mad? Who are you talking to? Just tell her that I know she and Ricardo had sex. It doesn't matter. - Look, see, - You are a thief. Let me tell you something… We know that you and Ricardo, your boss's husband, you both had sex. Boyfriend. You and her boyfriend had sex. Woman, where is the money? - Woman, where is the money? - Please. - Amoke. - Leave her. I'm having sympathy for her. - Amoke, if you are truly here, I'm sorry. - Woman… - She's over here. - Amoke, please. - I'm sorry, it wasn't deliberate. - You are looking the wrong way. - It was not intentional. - Woman, talk to her over there. She's over there, see her over there. Amoke, from the depth of my heart, I'm sorry. Forgive me. I didn't know when it happened. I mean... Stop talking. - Where is the money? - Ask her. Where is the money? Ask her. I… I actually slept with Ricardo. Ahh! Prostitute. Let me talk. It wasn't intentional. I feel very angry with myself every time I remember that. Because I never wanted to do it. It was a mistake. I didn't even know how it happened. And I have been looking for a way to apologize. I have been lonely all my life till I met her. She has been a friend and everything to me. And to be honest with you, I do not have a clue of what happened to her. I didn't kill her. I'm not like that. You are a loose woman. You are a loose woman. Don't be angry with her. You are a cheap woman. You know men hardly fight - because of women. - Yes. - So women should not fight... - Because of men. Because of a man. And to think that I almost fell for her stupid lies. Ricardo, just called her. You are a prostitute. - What? - You are big prostitute. We were going to help her beg Amoks. You won't believe it's the same guy that's calling her. It's not for anything though. - Not for anything. - Then what for? He's calling back. Tell her to pick the call. - Whatever happens... - Pick your call. What ever happened to me, - Pick your call. - I'm sure they worked together to plan it. Your phone is ringing! Pick your call. We are here, we are not going anywhere. Don't you want to go get the door? Erm, It's erm... Who? It's who? - No, just let it... - Come in. Come in. Fornicator. Adulteress. Oh my God. Adultery. That's him! That's Ricardo! - Babe, why aren't you picking my call. - Umm. You don't need to pretend. Don't worry, we will excuse you both. This is Amoke's husband that she has been sleeping with. My boyfriend. Boyfriend. Can you imagine. Guy, you are the one who caused all this. You are the one sleeping with your wife's PA. - Girlfriend. - That's how they do. - They will sleep with the wife, - What's the meaning of this? - Sleep with the house help. - Ebere. - You don't have to pretend. No need. - Ah, no! We are leaving now. Let's go. Let's go. This girl that Amoke sent us to. Let's go. Let's leave. Is it because you have chest, can you stand mine? Can you stand mine? Can you stand mine? This is real, can you stand it? You are a fornicator. You are scum. It's a pleasure to meet you. What the... It's just a long story. You are a ghost, right? God gave you the power to disappear and appear. Why don't you go inside and find out what he and Ebele are talking about. Ebere. Ebere. And Ricardo. What they are talking about? They can't lie to each other. - She's still here? - She's still here. Hey woman, be patient. Because you haven't given us the money you promised. You have been posting. Anyone who is in too much of a haste will fall. We all have to use our senses. - Maka, that's enough - Use your senses. - Are you cursed? - The money she promised us, - we didn't get any money. - She has disappeared - Has she gone? - She has gone. But do you know what I'm thinking of? - What is that? - Amaka. Just imagine that both of us are ghosts. Ah God. I will be an armed robber. Or if I was a ghost, - Suya! - Suya? - I will continue to steal suya. - Let's go. Let's go. Oh, why are you pissed? We have arrived. That's me. - It's going nowhere. - You are mad, I swear. Come on. Ghosts don't exist. How can she be a ghost if she's not yet dead? Come on, stop this madness. Listen Ebere, just listen to me. Ghosts… do not… exist. What is wrong with you? Ricardo, you should be ashamed of yourself. Why? - Come on Ebe... - Stop it. - Stop what? Ebere, come on. - Hey, stop it I said. Now get out of my house. - I should... - Get out of my house. Just go. Father Lord, I have come to you the way you brought me into this world. To show you how broken I am my Father. Father Lord, I come forth to your presence today. I beseech you oh Lord. I am here with a broken spirit. I swear to you that I didn't do anything to put Amoke where she is today. That is why I'm so broken, why I have come before you pleading. Have mercy on me. Have mercy on me. Forgive me, For what I did, and didn't even know when I did it. I'm sorry father. Amoke. Do not stop breathing. My father says that I'm worth five sons. But honestly, I I don't think I'm ever enough. You know, some girls will get dressed for their boyfriend but I would bury my head in the books. Because all that mattered, was becoming the best interior decorator ever. And thankfully enough I'm the successful, lucrative amazing, well known Interior decorator. Then Ricardo. You know, love didn't matter, feelings didn't matter, but when it came to Ricardo, I loved him. I dropped all of my fears, I dropped all of my guard. My everything because of him. And then at the end of the day, I fell flat on my face. And I was made the fool. Because of him. Can I tell you something? You see… these few days you and I have been together, I think you are a good person. But let me just be sincere, forget that the five hundred thousand you promised us, Makawhy is crazy, she will deal with you. You have to give us the five hundred thousand or else… I won't take that. But I will not lie, I like you. You're a wonderful... Is everything alright? Who are you talking to? - I'm soliloquizing. - What? What? I'm soliloquizing. Good night. That's what you people have turned me to. If anyone is passing by! So as we were saying, you have to give us our five hundred thousand Naira. But I like you. You're a good person. I assure you, we are doing our best. Thank you. Thank you. You know, the exact cause of her predicament it simply eludes understanding. ‎ I thought you would have slept. I would have slept? Because I don't have a job? I don't have a job. What's my job? My job is to lay down and sleep. What is the problem tonight? What do you mean by problem? What do you mean by problem? I don't have the energy for this. How will you have the energy my friend? You can't have the energy. A whole you would have energy? Energy that you have gone to waste else were with yourself. They have used you and still sucked everything leaving an empty container. You come here to tell me you don't have energy. You know it's only in this house that you show yourself. You will get here and become power Mike. Hulk Hogan. Anthony Joshua. Mighty Eagle. You will show your energy all over my body. When you go over there, what do they use you for? Hey Ricardo come and lick here… Yes, mommy. Come and eat here. Yes, mom. They just use you like a spanner. When they are done with you, they leave your empty container. You will head home empty after they have used all of your energy. Inem, Talking nonsense. This woman you are referring to, she's almost dead. You should at least have some empathy. That empathy will kill you. Let that empathy fall from heaven and press your neck to the ground. It's that empathy that will kill you. What is happening is bigger than what you think. I don't understand. What is my business? There is always a consequence for every action. How's that my... Please, stay away with your problems. Don't add me to it. Have you heard me? - Okay. - See, I saw her PA today she said… ‎ Ricardo. What? - Ricardo, are you okay? - How do you mean? Are they following you from your village? So you are done with her and you have moved to the PA. Ricardo, I salute you. Brother. You are a boss. - Inem - Don't you get tired? Inem, what her PA said, it got me scared. Why were you scared? See, She said, There is a woman that sees ghosts. She doesn't see angels? I'm asking you a question. She doesn't see angels? Because someone that sees ghosts is also a ghost. Can you see where you're heading to? You can see that you have started attracting ghost, demons, witches, wizards, witches, ghosts, mermaids. Hey, your thing will put you into trouble my brother. I'm only telling you… I'm only telling you… She said, that woman is looking for the person that poisoned Amoke. Let her see angels. You know what, sorry. Nonsense. Sorry, don't be offended. Do you know that she even gave me her card when they came. They want to ruin my reputation. They don't know how prepared I am. They don't know how prepared I am. They don't know that I have eaten lion's hearts. A hundred and twenty in my stomach. In my tummy. What do you want me to do? Let me show you. See that fair lady? Get her for me. If you cannot get her, get the dark one with the scattered hair. Let's hold what we can have while we wait for the other. Get that one for me. You know what, finish them. Which one is... - Ahh! - Good day ladies, - This is great. - Welcome to the monarch event centre. How many I help you? This place is fine. Thank you, ma'am. Be gentle with the chandelier. Wait, let me ask you? Please, let me ask you something? Is it that the woman that owns this place? - Yes, that's my CEO. - She's fine. We want to see your manager. Okay, that's fine.

As this place is, it's just fine for nothing? I will punch you. The money that you are supposed to - spend your money on security, - You use it for pictures. - Guns and TV's. - Ladies, The Monarch event centre has CCTV installed at every part of the centre. And we have a CCTV room that is monitored and controlled by humans that watch it. So you don't have a problem. Yes but, please, can you grant us the access to see? Please, I'm pleading. Please. I will still need to have a police warrant for that. But please can you come with me. Let's... Just her. Why?

Don't talk to me, we are not friends yet. - Yeah. - As I was saying downstairs, This is the control room of the Monarch event centre. The footage you need will be given to you only when I get the police warrant. Please. This is about life and death. It's very important, please. What you need is right here. Just give me the Police warrant and you will have it. I totally understand, thank you so much for you time. You are welcome. Thank you for your cooperation. - Isla, I'm thinking. - Yes - What are you thinking of? - The warrant she's talking about, - It's from the Police? - Yes Robo. Robocop can give us. You're right. I need your help. - With what? - A warrant. A warrant? Why? Robo, Ah! I can't tell you why but we need it right way. But Amaka, you know that I can't help you if you can't tell me what you need it for. Robo, you know in this life... The issues of this life, if you don't think with your head, you will get into trouble. You will get in to trouble. He's so proud. Even if you tell me, I will still need to talk to my superiors and that would also take time. Woman, get the warrant and let us leave already. They keep playing crazy love. Don't worry Robo. - Don't worry. - Are you sure? - Yeah, don't worry. - Are you sure? - You are good? - Don't worry. Yes. Let it go. You know my number if you need me. Okay. - Amy baby. - Robo. - Amy baby. - You are doing well. - I would see you later. - Take my word. - I said so. - Let me go... I need to go arrest some people. - I said so. - I'm coming. I know. - I know. - Take my word. - I will arrest your friend. - My boss. Stop it. Take my word. Amaka, why didn't you tell Robocop that we need it for the ghost we're trying to heal? Why didn't you tell him. - Why would I tell him such? - Why can't you tell him? Why should I tell him? And also, you were there when I greeted him and he disrespected me. Why? What would you have had me say. Am I your mother? Why should I tell him? Eh? Is it easy to tell someone that likes you, you are fighting for a ghost. - Or I'm helping a ghost. - Just listen to yourself. Someone that likes you. Are you married to him? Why are you behaving like someone that doesn't have sense? He likes you yet you don't know anything about him. Because you aren't living with him. You don't know if he has a family elsewhere? So out of everyone, why Robocop? Don't get me angry. - So, what if you get angry? - This chariot of fire, You haven't fueled chariot of fire. See yourself, you don't have sense. See yourself. You are so stubborn that you got your mom killed. Isla, what did you just say? What did you just say? - I'm sorry. - Don't be angry. Why are you crying? You are going to make me cry. As you called my mother into this, how does it concern her now? Don't be angry. Don't be angry. - I don't like what you do. - Don't be angry.

Are you mad? - You can't do anything. - Nothing will happen. - Your father! - Nothing will happen. Stop showing yourself. What do you mean by milk will come out? Take a look at Amaka. And she is asking us questions, for what reason? Who is the bastard that went to turn her house upside down? You both are crazy. Are the both of you crazy? Because you have green hair and yours is multi-colored, clearly you both are crazy. Because you know it's Akala that is given you both liver.

You know what, you've gone mad. - Woman, I'm tired of this. - Maka, why? - Can you see what you caused? - Where are your priorities?

I am truly fed up but there is this particular ghost who needs my help. It's not because of she herself but because she is with child. She is pregnant. It's just because she is with child. But wait Amoke, I want to ask you a question. Who is Ricardo? You will not sleep next to your darling career. And you will not make babies, from been married to your job. For me, it was Tolu. Excuse me? Electrician. You know when my mother realized that I was of marriageable age, She decided that it will be Tolu. The daughter of one of her Church fellowship members. I mean, she planned everything. She set the dates, everything. Are you serious? Yeah. Did you get married to her? I ran. I'm sorry. You know, I didn't realize that men go through the same pressures as women do. Oh. We go through some of those issues to. I see. It's just we, we just never have anyone to talk to. I mean, I kind of decided that, I wasn't going to get too upset with whatever she did. Because at the end of the day, it always came from a good place. From a place of love. I'm Ricardo by the way. Amoke. And I was like… you are fine. Oh stop it. And was like you are so beautiful. ‎ ‎ And that's how I met him. That fraud. Let me tell you something today, Amoke. We are by the water side. I want to promise you that The person that did this. I will help you get the person. Inem, it was you and I that planned this. - What did I plan with you? - We both planned it. Was there any day I planned with you to go get her pregnant. But you know it's a collateral damage. Please, stay away. Please leave me alone. Don't be angry. - Nonsense. - Come close. Look at me well. No, look at me well. - Don't be angry. - Because - you don't rate me. - Come. You are treating me like you don't rate me. There is something wrong with you. Me that... Calm down. - You always get angry. - Ricardo, you are going nowhere. Take a look at my face. Look at... Listen to me. I'm listening. It's I, Inem I'm your first, I'm your last.
