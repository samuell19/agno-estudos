Catch. Catch. Catch. Catch. Catch. Hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep, hep. (wind blowing) (sighs) Damien. (Exorcist theme playing) (eerie music) Preacher. (wind howling) (heavy breathing, eerie music) I have dreams of a rose and of falling down a long flight of steps. (thumping) (helicopters chopping) A light shall shine upon this day, for the Lord has been born unto us. And he is called wonderful. God, The Prince of Peace. [Man On Helicopter Radio] Dockside Hunter, sweep completed. Negative finding. Roger, River. Repeat, acknowledge. Peace, I give you. My peace, I leave you. As the world gives, do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled. Proceeding northeast, approximate, uh, location near.... The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life. (police radio chatter) (helicopters chopping) (sobbing) (birds chirping) So how did I do on my theology quiz? I recommend you change your name to Rajneesh. Really? "God is like a power mower"? (boy laughs) No kidding. Father, everything's relative. Is it? Or, maybe not. I like a man who knows his mind. Well, that's it, I'm, uh, I gotta go now. I'm driving to Philly. Speed kills. Who's to say? Not me. You know, Father, you mentioned a Damien Karras in your prayer for the dead. Yes, I did. Father, isn't he the one who-- Yes. Died in a fall on those steps? Yes, that's right, Tim. 15 years ago today. I hear a lot of-- Feldman, get lost, will you? All right, all right. I am flight. (door closes) (glass shatters) (thumping) You know that you did that. There's more potatoes. Could you pass the salt, AJ? Sure. Thank you. Joey, what did you say that offended Tom Lowery? He's our biggest benefactor. Oh, yes. What did you say to him? "Jesus loves you. Everyone else thinks you're an asshole." Sounded pleasant. Good morning, John. Back aches. Do we really have to have our own Olympics? Any plans today, Joe? This afternoon, I'm at the flicks. It's a Wonderful Life. Very nice. Seen it 37 times. That's commendable. Do you have a favorite picture? The Fly. You going alone or with the usual keepers? I'm taking Bill Kinderman with me. The cop? Yeah. Yeah, every, every year on this day he gets depressed, so I, I try to cheer him up. I cannot believe you, that you just said that. What kind of world is this? Are you an animal? Do you know what Macbeth is about? I'll tell you. It's a play about the numbing of the moral sense. I tell Ryan that we have nothing to go on this case. You know what he says to me? "Win some, lose some." You're a racist, Ryan. Did you know that? On the entrance exam for new policeman, they ask, "What are rabies and what would you do for them?" Ryan said, "Rabies are Jewish priests, "and I would do anything I possibly could for them." What was the murder weapon, Stedman? I'd be guessing. Well, if not us, who? And if not now, when? All right. Something like garden shears, maybe. We're abandoned. I didn't get you. I was signaling beings on Mars. Sometimes they answer. Funny. So, are you enjoying your luxury cruise aboard the Patna, Lord Jim? I want you to telex Richmond right away and most urgently for the file on the Gemini Killer. The Gemini Killer's been dead for 15 years. Who was speaking to you? But he's dead. He should live so long. And the autopsy? When, please? Tomorrow. And tomorrow, and tomorrow. I am leaving you. Ryan, Stedman, go home. Go home to your families. Talk about wops. Starving? Not really. Just some coffee. Hey, you've been up since five o'clock in the morning. I have this. How was your tour of Virginia? Neat. We stopped at a diner, and instead of potatoes, they served Mama grits. So she says right out loud, "These Jews are crazy." They are! They're all wackos. Next, they'll wanna eat papaya. My God. How was your day? Fabulous triumph. Our trackers at long last brought in Mushkin, the Georgetown terrorist and scourge of society who breaks into people's homes and completely redecorates. You okay, Bill? Hi, Daddy. And goodbye? Uh huh, off to dance class. Pocahontas with the hair. Watch out for red shoes. So, you're home now. No, gotta go again. Today is my day to cheer up our day Father Dyer. (approaching police sirens) (car screeches, sirens turn off ) What are you doing out here? Founding an order called Lurking Fathers? I've been out there for centuries. Four new popes have been elected. It's a lot of white smoke. Official business. So all right. So I'm late. So I know it. So I'm sorry. I got... You want butter on it? No. And could I have two Cokes, please? Medium or large? Medium. What are you doing? I need some lemon drops. We'll be late for the start of the picture. I once spent a year hearing children's confessions and I wound up a lemon drop junkie. Little weirdoes keep breathing it on you along with all that pot, and between the two of them, I've got a feeling it's probably addictive. (background chatter) Now I suppose you have all sorts of rosary biz and the like. No, no. Loose as a goose. Maybe you should go home and rest. I can't go home. Why? The carp. You know, I thought you said... My wife's mother is visiting, Father. And Tuesday night, she's cooking us a carp. It's a tasty fish, I have nothing against it. But because it's supposedly filled with impurities, she buys it live. And for three days it's been swimming up and down in my bathtub. Up and down. And I hate it. I can't stand the sight of it. Moving its gills. You're standing very close to me, Father. Have you noticed? Yes. I haven't had a bath for three days. I can't go home until the carp is asleep. (Joe laughs) Because if I see it swimming, I'll kill it. (background chatter) - And a salad. - Okay. The whole world is a homicide victim, Father. Would a God who is good invent something like death? Plainly speaking, it's a lousy idea. It's not popular, Father. It's not a winner. There you go, blaming God. Who should I blame, Phil Rizzuto? You wouldn't want to live forever. Yes, I would. No, you wouldn't. You'd get bored. I have hobbies. In the meantime, we have cancer and mongoloid babies and murderers, monsters prowling the planet. Even prowling this neighborhood, Father. Right now, while our children suffer and our loved ones die. And your God goes waltzing blithely through the universe like some kind of cosmic Billie Burke. Bill, it all works out right. When? At the end of time. That soon? No, we're gonna be there. We're gonna live forever, Bill. We're spirits. How I would love to believe that. It's that kid that got killed on the dock, isn't it? I heard it on the news. You wanna talk about it? You knew him. A little bit. Police Boys Club. His name was Thomas. Thomas Kintry. Black boy, about 12 years old. The killer drove an ingot into each of his eyes then cut off his head. Is this okay, Father? I can get you something else. Some more coffee? In place of his head was the head from a statue of Christ, all done up in blackface, like a minstrel show, you know? The eyes and the mouth painted white. Mr. Bones. The boy had been crucified on a pair of rowing oars. (church bells tolling, background chatter) May the Lord be in your heart and help you to confess your sins. Yes? (old woman) I have a... a scrupulous conscience, Father. This need to confess so many things. If I step on two straws in the shape of a cross I feel that I have to confess it. It torments me. Try to make a good confession. And remember, Christ forgives us, all of our sins. Only little things, nothing. Seventeen of them, Father. The first was that waitress near Candlestick Park. I cut her throat and watched her bleed. She bled a great deal. It's a problem that I'm working on, Father. All this bleeding. (maniacal laughter) (screaming and sobbing) (thunder rolling) (humming) (police radio chatter) I don't know. I don't know. He was such a good... (camera shutter clicking) (thunder rolling, police radio chatter) You know, I've been thinking, Lieutenant-- This is new. Do we need prints from the inside of the sliding panel? I mean, all you're gonna get are the prints of the priests. Yes, I know. Then what's the point? I'm padding the job. (clicking pen) (thunder rolling) (eerie music) (women laughing) (eerie music, wood sliding) (wood sliding continues) (window slams open) We got an autopsy on the boy. Yes. Kintry didn't die from the decapitation. He was injected with a drug called succinylcholine. They use it in electroshock therapy. But injecting 10 milligrams for each 50 pounds of body weight causes immediate and total paralysis. The kid couldn't move or scream while the killer was nailing and cutting him up. He was conscious? Yes. He was fully aware. The drug attacks the respiratory system. He died from slow asphyxiation. [Nurse On Speaker] Ms. Scott, please report to West Wing nurses' station. Father Dyer, Joseph Dyer, D-Y-E-R. He's in room 411, it's right down there. 411. [Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Miller, line 118. What's this nonsense? Well, nothing's really wrong. They're just doing some tests. You mean they couldn't find the rabbit? I don't know you. You're reading Women's Wear Daily? So what? Am I supposed to give spiritual advice in a vacuum? Is that for me? Oh, I found it in the street, I thought it suited you. (coughing) I thought you told me nothing's really wrong with you. There isn't, my brother Eddie had these same stupid symptoms for years. Your brother Eddie died at the age of 30. So what, he got killed in Vietnam. There could have be some connection. A connection? Are you sure this isn't serious, Joe? Well, with Eddie, there was-- You shut up about Eddie! With my brother, it was nerves. You make a lot of people nervous. Only sinners. Everybody! Is everything alright in here, guys? We're fine! I'm just tired. Well, call the desk and book a room. I brought you a hamburger, father. I'm not hungry. Eat half. It's from Clyde's. Where'd the other half come from? Space, your native country. Who stuck this guy? Nice and peaceful here, isn't it? Idyllic. Those things will kill you, incidentally. They're quiet. Mr. Horowitz? Nope. This is 409? 411. Never mind. Go in peace, my child. May the Schwartz be with you. Shouldn't you be reading from the Gospels or something? They don't give you all the fashions. Oh, this is true. Damn right. Look at the gooey gowns, they're getting boring. Couldn't you get me something serious to read? I've gotta be going. No, can't you pick me something up? My God, the grammar. No, I want The National Enquirer and The Star. There are Jesuit missions in India, Father. Couldn't you find one to work in? No look, these are all last week's editions. I've read every one of them. If you will forgive me, I'll leave this mystical conversation. Too much of aesthetics always gives me a headache. Is it something I said? Mother India is calling you, Father. [Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Kincaid to Orthopedics, please. [Nurse On Speaker] EKG stat to ER, EKG stat to ER. Father Kanavan's vocal cords were paralyzed. He couldn't make a sound. He couldn't cry out for help, so the killer was able to take his time. Succinylcholine again? In precisely the proper dosage to cause the paralysis. A fraction too little has no effect. A fraction too much causes instant death. Our friend has medical expertise. Did we find a hypodermic at the crime scene? No syringe. What about the fingerprint analysis? Most of the prints were the priest's. You said most? We've got something else. Right here, on the inside pull of this panel. It's strange. Nobody touches this pull but the priest. And the killer. See, he wants the panel closed, so the next person in line for confession doesn't know that Father Kanavan is dead. So he puts his hand in and slides it almost shut. Then he has to pull his hand back out and finish the job from the outside. So the prints on the oars from the crucified boy match the prints on the panel. Correct? They're one and the same. Well, aren't they? Two different people committed these murders? (Kinderman) Where's Julie? (Mary) At dance class. (Kinderman) So late? (Mary) Bill, it's only 10:00. (Kinderman) It's very late. (clock ticking) (music box chiming) (ominous music) [Man On Speaker] Your attention, please. Your attention. The 12:18 to Elksberg now departing from track 11. All passengers boarding proceed to the gate. Let me out of this damn casa blanca! (eerie classical music) (Boy 1) No, it isn't! (Boy 2) Yes, it is. (Boy 1) No, it isn't. (Boy 1) If it hits the line, it's out of bounds. (Boy 1) The line is in bounds! (Boy 2) No, it's not, it's out! (Boy 1 ) It hit the dirt! Earth, come in please. Can you hear us? We are attempting to communicate. Come in, please. The living are deaf. We come here first. Lieutenant. How you doing, lieutenant? I'm so sorry you were murdered, Thomas, I miss you. I miss you too. (smooth big band playing) You know, I wonder if both of us are dreaming this. No, Bill. I'm not dreaming. (big band music builds) (ominous music) (phone ringing) Kinderman. What are you telling me? Hold it. (people whispering) (police radio chatters) I've just never seen anything like this in 20 years. Call it. I've seen it. (police radio chatters, camera clicking) (camera continues clicking) [Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Bartlet, please call the operator. Dr. Bartlet, please call the operator. [Nurse On Speaker] EKG stat to ER, EKG stat to ER. [Nurse on Speaker] Dr. Bartlet, please call the operator. Dr. Bartlet, please call the operator. Ugh... (thunder rolling) What are these? What are they, what's in them? Father Dyer's entire blood supply. What? All of his blood? And not a drop of it spilled. All neat. There's not even a smudge on the jars. There's only the writing in his blood. Writing? On the wall. (thunder rolling) (ominous music) [Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Hoffman, line 412. Lieutenant. [Nurse On Speaker] Dr. Hoffman, line 412, please. Take a squad of men. Make sure all the hospital doors are locked. Make a pattern search. No one in. No one out. Except for emergencies. No one. All right. [Nurse on Speaker] EKG stat to ER, EKG stat to ER. Now, what time was the body discovered? At six. By whom? You saw him at 5 a.m.? Yes, that's right. He was awake? He was awake. I came to give him medication. How long did it take you? About a minute. And then what? I came back to the desk. And you were here to do what and do, see Father Dyer again at six o'clock, is that right? Yes, that's right. Were you here or inside in the office? I was inside the office, I was writing up reports. So, If someone had entered Father Dyer's room between the time you left and the time you returned, you might well not have seen them. That's right. Did you see anybody else come into the room? No, I didn't. Or leaving the room? No, I didn't. Did you see anybody in the hallway? Did you see anybody in the hallway? Mrs. Clelia. You saw Mrs. Clelia walking around? No, not exactly. Not exactly? I found her lying completely unconscious. When was that? On my way to give the Father his last medication. The five or the six? The six. Mrs. Clelia is a patient? Yes, she is. In Neurology? [Nurse on Speaker] Dr. Randolph to examining bay two. Dr. Randolph to examining bay two, please. (moaning) How we doing today? They're all harmless. Some more serious problems here too, though, of course. Some catatonics, some with Alzheimer's, autism. Are you my son? I'd be very proud to believe so. You're not my son. (eerie growling) There's your girl over there. (humming) Mrs. Clelia? My name is William Kinderman. Yes. Would you help me, please? What about my radio? Pardon me? I said, my radio. Aren't you gonna fix it? Ugh, nothing ever gets fixed around here. Just a bunch of pies and anchovies. Go away! I don't ever talk to strangers. I'm the radio repairman, Mrs. Clelia. Well, fix it. Well, what's wrong with it? Dead people talking. It's right here. Do you see it? Yes, I see it. I just knew you weren't really a radio repairman. That's a telephone I'm holding. It's alright. A lot of people wouldn't know the difference either. It's all right. You have a very kind face. You will do well. (humming) You caught her on a talkative day. You being funny? No, she's quasi-catatonic, in and out. What's this? It's the disturbed ward. (door slides shut) To get out, you punch a four-digit combination that sends a signal out to the control booth. The inner door opens. The control booth operator visually checks through the one-way glass. And, every day, there's a new combination. I'd like to look around. Bill. (door slides open) Lieutenant. Dr. Freedman's gone ballistic, sir. I think you need to come. (inaudible dialogue) Death, be not proud. Though some have called thee mighty and dreadful, thou art not so. Though soonest our best men with thee go, rest of their bones and soul's delivery, but those thou dost thinkest thou dost overthrow die not, poor Death. Nor canst thou kill me. I was only 21 when I died. We're a hospital here, not a war zone. How do you expect us to keep people calm when you're running around here-- (phone ringing, yelling muffled) You need a court warrant in order to be here doing what you're doing! Look, I fully appreciate your trying to prevent further tragedy. Think of the state of our patients' minds when you've got these policemen here-- Lieutenant wants fingerprints taken of all the hospital staff. He said fingerprints. Not on your life, god dammit! No sir, no way, Jose! No, he's standing right here. Do you want to talk to him? I don't want 100 lawyers running up and down the halls. Do you want to talk to him! You ever heard of malpractice suits? You ever heard of the Gemini Killer? Have I what? I said-- Yes, of course I've heard of him, so what? He's dead. That's right, he died in the electric chair. And so why are we talking about that? Just a minute, I'll explain. Yes, the Gemini is dead. We know that, but do you recall all the stories in the papers and on television, about the Gemini's strange MO? I'll remind you. Supposedly, supposedly the middle finger of the victim's left hand was always found severed, always missing. In addition, on the victim's back we were told, the killer carved out a sign of the zodiac. The Gemini symbol, the twins. That was 15 years ago. Go ahead, Lieutenant. Temple, why are you encouraging this? Would you shut your mouth! Excuse me. Excuse me. [Nurse On Speaker] EKG stat to ER. EKG stat to ER. The Gemini MO that you heard about is false. The missing finger was not on the victim's left hand, but on the right, it was the index finger, this one. And the sign of the Gemini was carved not on the victim's back, but on the victim's left hand palm. Only Richmond Homicide knew that, no one else. A misinformation was fed to the press in order to weed out all the crackpots who were coming in saying everyday that they were the Gemini killer. How did you kill him? "Well, first I cut off this finger," the loony says, "And on their backs I made my mark." Next case. But, in this case, gentlemen, in this three decapitations, three victims, with this finger severed, the correct one. And the sign of the Gemini here. Here! One more thing. The Gemini wrote letters to the newspapers, bragging about his murders. And he always doubled his final L's, whatever the word, two L's, as in wonderfull. Yes. The victims' names always starting with K, like Karl, his father the famous evangelist whom he hated and wanted to shame. And whom he wanted to kill and keep killing and killing. But the priest, Father Dyer, Joseph Dyer. Father Dyer's middle name was Kevin. Kevin. (eerie wind blowing) Even that could do it. Would it take a lot of strength? No, not at all. Very little, in fact. Spring-activated, open it, and it closes on its own. Takes strength just to open it. Oh... It's a little stiff. It needs adjustment. What's this? What? This label. Just a shipping tag. Is it new? Just came in. A replacement? Where's the old one? (clock ticking) Two priests and a crucified boy, Father Healey. Clearly some religious connection, but what is it? I don't know what I'm looking for. I'm groping. (sighs) But, besides being priests, what might Kanavan and Dyer have had in common? Where's the link? I don't know. I don't know. Dear God. (clock falls silent) It could be that exorcism. The MacNeil kid, Regan MacNeil. The exorcism over on Prospect Street that Damien Karras did, the one that killed him. (soft sobbing) (door creaking) (whispering in foreign language) (soft thump) (door creaking) (whispering in foreign language) (ominous rattling) (whispering in foreign language) (dramatic echoing) (moaning) (whispering in foreign language) (growling) (screaming) (laughing) Excuse me. (Father) Alice! The speech! Will you give this to Father, please Lieutenant? I gotta run. What's the matter with these lights? Good night, Alice! Good night, Father. (door slams) Your speech, Father. Thanks. That's all right. Need a drink? I do. Do you believe in possession, Father? Who cares? I've got enough to do worrying about kids who need scholarships. I'll talk to Paul Morning, if you like. Who is he? He's our chaplain over at the hospital. They say he performed an exorcism once in the Philippines. The story is his hair turned white overnight. Is that true? What's the difference? What's that got to do with this? Well, you mentioned that exorcism. As a connection. To the people who were murdered, you mean. That's right. Joe and Damien Karras were very close. Yes, I know. Joe was also a friend of the MacNeils. And Father Kanavan? Kanavan had my job back then. He gave Damien permission to investigate the case. That leaves us with the Kintry boy, Father. Does it? Damien gave our School of Linguistics a tape he wanted them to analyze for him, the voice of the MacNeil kid, supposedly possessed. He wanted to find out if the sounds on the tape were a language or just a lot of gibberish. He was looking for proof the MacNeil kid was speaking in a language she couldn't possibly have known. And was she? No. The tape was really English in reverse. But the expert who figured that out-- Was Kintry's mother. (bird chirping) (bird falls silent) (ominous music) (ominous music, footsteps echoing) (wind blowing, paper flapping) (beeping) This is impossible. (thunder rolling, rain falling) Do you remember coming in here when the priest died, Mrs. Clelia? You're the radio man. Yes, that's right. Do you remember coming in here? Do you remember coming in here and touching those jars? Why did you touch them, Mrs. Clelia? Was there anyone else in this room? Who was in here? That radio isn't mine. Mine is newer. That man in the isolation tank, you know, the one you looked in on? (clears throat) You know, the one you looked in on. Well, the police brought him in here 15 years ago. They picked him up wandering the C&O Canal, uh, no, no, down around Key Bridge. Yes, total amnesia. The man in the isolation tank... You know, the one you looked in on. The police brought him in here 15 years ago. They picked him up wandering the C&O Canal. Down around Key-- (door rattling) You had something to tell me? Please, sit down. There's a paper drive? Haven't had a chance yet to read them. I just keep them till I do. I hate to miss the science articles. They're good. (thunder rolling) That man in the isolation tank, you know, the one you looked in on. Yes. The police brought him here 15 years ago. They picked him up wandering the C&O Canal down around Key Bridge, total amnesia, no ID. They brought him to us here, and his condition grew worse. He ended up catatonic, completely withdrawn. But recently... Well, about six weeks ago, he slowly started to come out of it. Every day he got better, just a little, but better. And then all of a sudden, he got violent, really bad news. We've been giving him electroshock therapy, and as of two weeks ago he's been in isolation, but... The thing is, Lieutenant... Yes? He says he's the Gemini Killer. (eerie music) I want the file on that man. Get it. Now! You wanted to know about the man in cell 11. Stretch your memory. What was he wearing when they brought him in? Do you recall? That was quite some time ago. Was he dressed like a priest? Like a priest? Were there any signs of injuries? Blood, lacerations? That would be in the file. It is not in the file! It is not! Two men on every ward. Rotate them 24 hours a day. Mm-hmm. On the disturbed ward, one man inside near the entry door, one man outside the door. Ask the Jesuits in Georgetown for the dental records of a Father Damien Karras. Find out if he ever had a saliva test. Might help us get a positive identification. What for, sir? Sir, are you alright? Mmm... [Nurse On Speaker] IV team to NICU. IV team to NICU. You all right? Yeah. Father Karras, was a Jesuit psychiatrist at Georgetown University. The man was a saint. He was my best friend, I loved him. Fifteen years ago, he jumped or was pushed to his death down that long flight of steps next to the Car Barn. Atkins, I saw it. I watched him, die. I think, the man in cell 11, is Damien Karras. (growling) It's a wonderful life. (water dripping) Who are you? I am no one. Many. Are you Damien Karras? Ah, you haven't any medical records for him, have you? No tedious fingerprints. Are you Karras? I am the Gemini Killer, James Venamun. The Gemini is dead. No, not quite. Remember Karen? Little ribbons in her hair? Yellow ribbons. I killed her. Well, after all, it was inevitable wasn't it? A divinity shapes our ends, and all that. I picked her up in Richmond. And then I dropped her off at the city dump, some of her. Some of her I kept. I'm a saver. Pretty dress she was wearing. Little peasant blouse, pink, and white ruffles. I still hear from her occasionally, screaming. I think the dead should shut up unless there's something to say. I also killed the black boy by the river, and the priests. Oh, yes, their names began with a K. That little modicum at least, I was able to insist upon. You see, they were off my beaten track. I kill at random. That's the thrill of it. No motive, that's the fun. The black boy and the priests were different. I was obliged to settle a score on behalf of, well, a friend. What friend? A friend over there, on the other side. One needs friends. There is suffering over there. They can be cruel. Who is they? Never mind. I cannot tell you, it's, forbidden. (loud growling) I do that rather well, don't you think? Well why not, after all, I've been taught by the master. Who is that? The one. There is only one. (water dripping) Incidentally, who is this Damien you mentioned? Don't you know? I know nothing, except I must go on killing daddy, I must shame him. Are they calling these Gemini killings in the papers? You must get them to do that, Lieutenant. It's important. The Gemini is dead. No, I am not, I'm alive! I go on, I breathe! Look at me, look at me, and tell me what you see! I see a man who looks like Damien Karras. If you looked with the eyes of faith, you'd see me. What the hell are you talking about? Your blindness. Tell the press that I am the Gemini, Lieutenant, or I will punish you. Punish me? Yes. What are you talking about? Do you dance? What do you mean? (female voice singing in foreign language) I like plays. The good ones, Shakespeare. I like Titus Andronicus the best. It's sweet. Incidentally, did you know that you are talking to an artist? I sometimes do special things to my victims. Things that are creative. Of course, it takes knowledge, pride in your work. For example, a decapitated head can continue to see for approximately 20 seconds. So when I have one that's cocking, I always hold it up so that it can see its body. It's a little extra I throw in for no added charge. I must admit, it makes me chuckle every time. Life is fun. It's a wonderful life, in fact, for some. It's too bad about poor Father Dyer. I killed him, you know. An interesting problem, but finally it worked. First, a bit of the old succinylcholine to permit one to work without annoying distractions. Then... a three foot catheter threaded directly into the inferior vena cava, or the superior vena cava. It's a matter of taste, I think, don't you? Then the tube moves through the vein, under the crease of the arm, into the vein that leads directly into the heart. And then you just hold up the legs and you squeeze the blood manually into the tube from the arms and the legs. There's little shaking and pounding at the end for the dregs. It isn't perfect. There's a little blood left, I'm afraid. But, regardless, the overall effect is astonishing. And isn't that really what counts in the end? Yes, of course. Good showbiz, Lieutenant, the effect! And then, off comes the head without spilling one single drop of blood. Now, I call that showmanship, Lieutenant. Then of course, no one notices. Pearls before-- (hand smashing face) Oh, a few boos from the gallery, I see. That's all right. I understand. I've been dull. Well, I shall liven things up for you a bit, Lieutenant. The master is throwing me scrap from his table, a reward for faithful service, something fun, something random, something my way. Good night, moon. Good night, air. Good night, Amy. Telling her beads... Her beads... (Kinderman) He passed out. (Nurse) Again? My god, he's hemorrhaging. The man in that cell, knows the details of a murder of a girl named Karen, happened years ago. Yes? It was a Gemini killing that never appeared in the papers. His goddamn nose is broken! When I told you that the man in cell 11 fell unconscious, you said something. Really? Yes, I think you said, "Again?" Might've done. Does that mean that it's happened before? Yes, it has. Many times? No, not really. It's just been this week. I think the first time was Sunday. And again? The next day. If you want exact times, it's-- On your chart. Yes, that's right. Any other times? Early yesterday morning, just before we found-- Yes, that's all right. I'm very sorry. When this happens, does it seem like a normal sleep? Nothing's normal about that man. You seem a little pleased about that. Well, it's quite unusual. His autonomic system slows to a crawl, his heartbeat, his temperature, his breathing, but his brain wave activity accelerates. Accelerates? Okay, keep that on until the weekend. You're most kind. I'm a bitch. Have you ever told the man in cell 11 what happened to Father Dyer? No, of course not. Might anyone else have told him? Why would they? I don't know. I don't, either. Thanks again, Miss. Why did you hit him? Take it easy on that hand. I will. "Save your servant." That's just something our friend in cell 11 said one time. "Save your servant?" Keeps running through my mind. An odd expression. What was odd was how he said it. How was that? It was just his voice, it was different. Different how? He sounded decent, nice, completely different. And there was so much emotion in his voice. He sounded, I don't know, desperate. And what else has he said in this voice? Only one other thing. And what was that, Miss? He said, "Kill it." (footsteps echoing) "Save your servant who trusts in you, my God. "Let him find in you Lord, a fortified tower in the face of the enemy." The Lord is my light and my salvation. The Lord is the defender of my life. My life... "And Jesus said "to the man who was possessed, "What is your name? "And he answered, 'Legion, for we are many.'" Many. (door closing) Good night, Daddy. Good night, Julie dearest. It's so late. Yes, it is, very late. (growling) (rattling) (door closes) (creaking) (ice cracking) (screaming) God, can't I get any sleep? What the hell do you want? I'm sorry, I'm very sorry. Bad enough you wake me up at half past five for breakfast. Sir, I'm sorry. You're sorry? I think you do this on purpose. What's your name? I'm going to report you. My name is Amy Keating, good night. (sighs) Angels of mercy, horseshit. (footsteps running away) (noisily rattling at desk) You all right? Yeah. Yes, I'm fine, I'm just a little jumpy, that's all. Okay. (grinding) (grinding continues) (keys jingling) (door creaks open light clicks on) (light clicks off) (ominous rumbling, screaming) She was slit down the middle, cut open, and all her vital organs were removed. Then the killer stuffed her body with other materials and sewed her back up. Other materials? Rosaries, Catholic rosaries. Lieutenant! (ominous rumbling) Did you get my message? I left it with Keating. Nice girl, good heart. (machine rattling) Yes, about this body of mine, friend of yours. Well, there I was, so awfully dead in that electric chair. I didn't like it. Would you? It's upsetting! There was still so much killing to do, and there I was, in the void without a body. But then along came, well, you know, my friend, one of them, those others, there, the cruel ones, the master. And he thought that my work should continue, but, in this body. In this body in particular, in fact. Oh, let's call it revenge. A certain matter of an exorcism, I think in which your friend, Father Karras expelled certain parties from the body of a child. Certain parties were not pleased, to say the least, to say the very least, and so my friend, the master devised this pretty little scheme as a way of getting back, of creating a stumbling block, a scandal, a horror to the eyes of all men who seek faith, using the body of this saintly priest as an instrument of... Well, you know my work. But, the main thing, is the torment of your friend, Father Karras, as he watches while I rip, and cut, and mutilate the innocent! His friends! And again, and again! And on and on! He is inside with us! He will never get away! His pain won't end! (growling) Oh, gracious me, was I raving? Please forgive me. I'm mad. Let's see, where was I? Oh, yes, the master. He was kind, you see. He brought me to our mutual acquaintance, Father Karras. Not too well at the time, I'm afraid he was passing on in the dying mode as we say. So, as Karras was about to slip out of his body Is this true? The master was slipping me in. Oh now, there was some confusion when the medics said that Karras was dead. I mean, he was dead, technically speaking. I mean, his time was up. He wanted out, but I was in. A little traumatized, true. I mean, after all, his brain was jelly, lack of oxygen and all that sort of thing. You understand? It took a maximum effort that at last got me out of that cheap little coffin! Vow of poverty, disgusting. Never mind. Toward the end, a little slapstick and comic relief when that old Brother Fain who was tending the body, saw me climbing from the coffin. (laughing) It's the smiles that keep us going, don't you think? The little giggles and bits of good cheer. But then, after that, it was all blue Mondays for a while, I'm afraid. So much damage to Karras' brain cells. So many lost. It's not enough, you see, to be a spirit. There's no magic. In this artificial box that you call a world, we cannot touch except through bodies, you understand? We must operate through neurologic systems, brains that function, and your friend's was nearly past resurrection. It was quite an effort to regenerate his puny little brain cells. It took me 15 years! So many years. Oh, I'm just a traveling man, one who moves. (thunder rolling) I have dreams of a rose, and falling down a long flight of stairs. I don't believe you're the Gemini Killer. Oh, you are issuing a clear invitation to the dance. What does that mean? Never mind. Incidentally, don't blame me for that idiot Temple. That was a suicide. The man was a lunatic weakling. Still, he helped me. Are there services? I would like to attend. Temple helped you? Yes, of course! He brought you to me. I told him if he failed to convince you to come to me that he would suffer in unspeakable ways. "Pain that cannot be imagined," I said. Poor superstitious fool, he believed me, but he couldn't take the pressure it would seem. What pressure? The pressure of inimitable me. Some other tasks I said I had in mind for him, things, little things. Did Temple get you out of this cell? Who gets you out? Just friends, old friends. Tell the press that I am the Gemini, Lieutenant, final warning. Incidentally, I can help. Help what? Your unbelief. I'm tired. I am so tired. (Damien) Bill, help me. Damien? No! (ominous rumbling) Little Jack Horner, child's play, Lieutenant. Father Morning, please. Jimmy, I can't read this. Korner, K-O-R-N-E-R. I'll call again. See you later, alligator. [Nurse With Patient] Come on sweetheart, let's go back to your room. Just take your time. That's it. Take it easy. (Kinderman) How do you get out of here? (Gemini) Old friends, old friends. I'm a traveling man, one who moves. Old friends, one who moves. One who moves, one who... (indistinct chatter) I didn't hear it, say it again, will you? Yeah, and I... (mumbling) (ominous rumbling) (ominous music) (ominous music) Hit the lights! Mommy! God almighty! What the hell do you think you're doing? Are you crazy? What on Earth is the matter with you? I want my mommy. Just toys. Is that a crime? He's after someone, who? You treat your own family like this? Aren't you leaving? Please leave, I cannot wait for you to leave! Oh, you are issuing a clear invitation to the dance, to the dance, to the dance... Julie. (phone ringing) Hello. Bill. Hiya, honey. Where... Uh-huh. (busy signal beeping) Uh-huh. Okay, sweetheart. That was Bill. There's a nurse coming over with a package. Danny, get in the car! Roll it, roll it, move it, move it, go, go! (sirens blaring, wheels squealing) (ominous music) (sirens blaring, wheels squealing) (ominous music) (sirens blaring, wheels squealing) Go around! Ram it if you have to! Ram it. Back up, you son of a, get out! Go! (doorbell ringing) That must be the nurse. (machine ticking) (growling) (wheels squealing) Go around the back! Oh, hi, Dad. Mother, Daddy's home. What's this? Billy, what's going on? I'm crazy, that's the only explanation. Well, you're honest. Let's start from the beginning. It's alright. No, it isn't alright. What's this nurse thing? What nurse? I'm so tired. Oh hi, Stevie! Yeah, how'd it go? Julie! Daddy, I'm talking. Sorry, Steve, I missed that. Bill, what kind of a nurse is this? I open the door for the woman, she faints. And then when she wakes up, she says, "When is it bedtime?" Please help me. Is it bedtime? So is she staying for dinner or what? It's okay, Danny, we're good. (ominous music) [Gemini Possessing Old Nurse] Catatonics are so easy to possess. I've been waiting for you, Lieutenant. I wanted you to see this. Julie! (screaming) Daddy! (growling) (screaming) Grandma! (growling, screaming) What's this? Morning! (screaming) (growling) (Gemini) You again. You've interrupted me. Have you come to save God's servant? Well, I must save mine. My son, the Gemini, he has work to do, much more, but come in, Father Morning. Enter, night. This time you're going to lose. In the name of the Father, (voices screaming) and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen! "Save your servant "who trusts in you, my God. "Let him find in you, Lord, "a fortified tower in the face of the enemy. "Our Father, who art in heaven, "hallowed be thy name. "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done--" I see, we are praying now. Bright prayers. "Give us this day our daily bread." Do you think they will save you now, as before? Well, I can pray too. Do you feel my little orisons creeping up your spine? The sweaty murmurs of my rosary beads, the human hearts that I've taken into hell? "I cast you out, unclean spirit! "Along with every satanic power of the enemy! "Every specter from hell, "in the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ. (Gemini laughing) "It is he who commands you, "he who once stilled the sea and the storm, "he who flung you from heaven to the depths of hell! "You robber of life, "you author of pain. "you corruptor of justice, and innocence, and youth, "you begetter of death, sworn enemy of all the human race!" (screaming) I command you. (screaming) Allerton? Nurse Al-- (door sliding open) (ominous rumbling) (growling) Don't worry about Julie, we'll get her. Pray for me, Damien. You're free. (ominous grinding, equipment slamming) Did you think to save your friend the priest? My God, help! (panting) Help me. Have I helped your unbelief? Oh, yes. Yes, I believe. I believe in death. I believe in disease. I believe in injustice and inhumanity. And torture, and anger and hate. I believe in murder! I believe in pain! I believe in cruelty and infidelity! I believe in slime, and stink, and in every crawling putrid thing, every possible ugliness, and corruption, you son of a bitch! I believe, in you. (lightning and thunder crashing) (lightning and thunder crashing) My God! Go, Bill. Why God! You grow tiresome, Lieutenant, and foolish. Save your prayers. God is not here with us now. There is only the darkness here, and your death. (slamming against ceiling) Save your servant, who trusts in you, my God. You! Damien, fight him. Goodbye, Lieutenant. Damien! Fight! Fight! You cannot win. He dies. No! Bill, now, shoot now, kill me now! (gun firing) We won, Bill. Now, free me. (hammer cocks) (gun firing) (singing in foreign language) (singing in foreign language)
