THE CONDUCTOR Doesn't pick up? Even the house phone? Listen, Petrov disappeared. Can you believe it? Like some mysticism. Such people don't disappear. It's you and I who will disappear. Why do you think he disappeared? For 30 years he has never been late, never been sick. And now - gone! Vanished! So what? He will come. He will glare at me with those eyes like a basilisk. Why do you care about him? I don't care, I'm not worried. It's you who is worried. Me? You'll get to go to your Jerusalem, don't worry. Otherwise you'll lose your voice completely. That's my voice. Go, go... Hello. Slava! Slava! What's this? You quit smoking? Slava, everyone is already there. They're worried. They're waiting for you. Regarding the concert in Jerusalem. Yes. I will fly out this evening. And the rehearsal? Soloists will fly with me. Buy them plane tickets. Soloists will finish learning their parts in Jerusalem. The orchestra is ready. Clear? Go. Slava, may I ask? What happened? I will come to the rehearsal right now. Go. The Lord and Creator of all, the changeless God, Descend to unite the creature created by you to your holy self. And now as at the passover you offer yourself To those for whom you are about to die, Crying, eat my body and be confirmed in faith! Allow me to start one more time from the beginning. Don't. The rehearsal is over. Our schedule has changed. Soloists are flying with me to Jerusalem tonight. Pushenkov will give you the flight tickets. Thank you. Damn. Couldn't they tell me earlier. I have a meeting scheduled. I have to run. How much I love these honest eyes of yours. OK. Run to your meeting. Thank you. See you at the airport. Sergey! You forgot your sweater. Vyacheslav Yurievich... May I have a word with you, Vyacheslav Yurievich? Lately it's been very rough for me. Not so good. It's all because last year I spent a long time in the hospital after the accident. - You remember? - Get to the point. It may have seemed to you that my work has not been very good lately. It hasn't seemed. I can hear that your work is not very good. This is the result of my sickness and... - Are you sick? - Yes... no. Stay here. That's the problem - I can't stay here. I... - I'm already all alone and... - Talk to Pushenkov. - Hi. - Hi. Are you the first here? Probably. Alla called said she couldn't reach you. Phone battery died. She called you before you called me. Stands 65 and 67 over there. No, take just mine. I'll go right now. - She asked you to wait. - That's alright. Lend me some money. - How much? - A 1,000. - You're not tired of lying? - If I don't lie, she will cry. If she will cry, I will feel bad. If I will feel bad, I will sound bad. Logical? Thanks. Do you know, has Petrov sent the musical score to someone in Jerusalem? I don't know. And I heard that... he asked a local tenor singer there to learn my part, so that he could sing it. Does he want to fire me? Jenya, don't say stupid things. Go check in. - Hi. - Hi. - Sergey still not here? - He has already checked in. What? I asked you to tell him! I told him. Take it. Stands 65 and 67. Business class stand is 68. OK. Why didn't you wait for me? Meaning? Why did you check in alone? Didn't want to stand in a long line. Wonderful. Now we will sit separately from each other. We can switch seats, if needed. We'll switch, if it's possible. It's just that... I wanted us to sit together. We are flying to Jerusalem after all. Listen... - Let me put it on. - What is it? Let me. It will protect you during flight. And in general... In place of a parachute. Out of your mind? Solodovs, you are late! - We're not married yet. - The coming day has much in store for us. This is yours and the cello? Stands 65 and 67. Mom, it hurts. Are ears hurting? Just wait. Mom, it hurts. Senya, once the plane gets high enough, your ears will stop hurting. Hurting really bad? Try opening your mouth. Open it real wide. Like that. Now open and close several times. Just like that. Let's do it together. Like a fish. Is it helping? Better? Thank you. OK. Thank God we're in the air now. What? We're in the air. I'm so happy. We're flying to the holy land. Is everything good? Yes, everything is good. - Excuse me, but... - I'm only here for a second. - He is my assistant. - I will leave right now. - Did Nadejdin speak with you? - He did. Why did we take him at all? Please, go easy on him. I really ask you to. OK, we'll see. OK. I go. Also going to Israel? Though where else. Vacation? No, a pilgrimage. Going to a monastery. - Where will you live? - At the monastery. The monastery has it's own hotel. What interesting times we live in. Monasteries have become hotels, one can simply book a cell. - Is is "all included"? - Meaning? - Well, are all the comforts there? - Comforts? Don't know, didn't ask. If I was building a hotel as part of a monastery, I would've built it without any comforts. The soul is cleansed by suffering. You are mean. Just a bit. Sorry, if I offended you. I'm not offended. You shouldn't be, actually. Sorry again... It's just that my wife is very religious. It forces one to become an atheist. I feel for you. - The stone fell out. - What! Darn... It's a pity. Let me out, please. - Why are you flying? - For work. I have a concert. - Where is the concert? - In Jerusalem. By the way, I think you'll find it interesting. Church music. I don't know much about it. An oratorio. I sing an evangelist part there. Do you want to come hear it? - Seriously? - Absolutely. With pleasure. - Promise? - I promise. - Then give me your phone number. - Write it down. Aren't you planning to get married in church? Church marriage? Church marriage? No, not yet. You should, Dima. You really should. Marriage comes from the Lord. Marriage should be for a lifetime. Yes, of course. He enters, slows down, walks back. And suddenly - he falls... - Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. Please meet my wife Alla. This is Olga. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. Actually, you'll find this interesting. Olga is a pilgrim and she will live directly in a monastery. - In a monastery? Really? - Yes. - Which monastery? - Gorny convent. How fantastic that is. How could you arrange it? I just bought a tour package. Is that possible? Just purchase a tour? Yes. Of course. It actually comes out to be cheaper than staying at a hotel. In that sense. And I just could not convince my husband. I could not convince him to go visit any holy places. - And now work, so we... - Yes, Sergey told me. You told her already? OK. Since you are not bored here, I will go back to my seat. - See you later. - See you later. Where was I? We keep on flying, but the scenery does not change... So what? It means we're not flying anywhere. It means there's desert beneath us. How nice it would be, if everything just ended right now... Stop. And don't look out the window. Are you scared? What scum you are after all! What? You and your Petrov sent the musical score to Jerusalem in advance, - so that someone else learned it and sang it. - I don't know anything about that. Of course, you don't know. If you don't know, then it's simply a joke. Why are you taking me, if he doesn't want me to sing? Jenya, you're being paranoid. Calm down. Let me sleep. Sleep, sleep. Sleep tight. - Where are you going? - Can't I use the restroom? Thanks. How nice it is in here. So, did you find me a replacement? Tell me, did you send the score to Jerusalem, so that someone learned it and could replace me? Yes. What do you mean "yes"? I did send it. So why am I here then? I don't know. But I know. I know. Wait! Wait. Excuse me. I need to talk to the gentleman. I know. Wait, I told you I need to talk to him. I am here to tell you that everyone in the group is scared of you. It's humiliating. I am scared of you more than anyone else. Because they have someone to protect them, but I don't - I am all alone. Only I'm not a tomato that you can stomp on, throw away... or squeeze the juices from. There's blood inside of me. Human blood! And you are drinking it, this blood. I am all alone in this life. Because I have nobody. I don't have my Olya or Nadya. Otherwise I would've... - Leave the cabin. - I haven't finished yet. - Take your hands off of me. - Come with me. Give me my personal space. Give me my life... Hey... Let me go! Maybe she is lonely? A pilgrim. That's what she said. What else did she say? Nothing. I did most of the talking. Yeah. You recited poetry to her? I did. You invited her to the concert, right? I did, why? Nothing. So you did. Good job. Maybe you'll finally have some religious friends. I am Sasha's father. I am Sasha's father! Hello, father. Where is Sasha? - Yeah, it's him. - It's Sasha's father. - I sent you the fax. - Want some beer? - Is that him? - It is him. What? What is she saying? Kill him. Get her off. Kill him. - I want to kill him. - Calm down. - Do you know how he died? - How? How? He hung himself. Why? Debt. He was in debt to everyone here, but he had no money. In order to have money a person must work. He worked. He was an artist. Why didn't you send him money? Why didn't you? I did not want to. You should be killed. Enough. We have to give Sasha a burial, right? Of course you don't have money for the burial. That's why you wrote to me. Right? Yes. What is she saying? She says that you have plenty of money. We all saw your posters all over the city. Listen, give us money. He doesn't want to. - Will you buy a painting? - Don't. - What painting? - Sasha's painting. A good one. Come, I'll show you. Don't. I'll show you. Wait, don't! Don't, I'm telling you! Come, come. You'll see, you'll like it. Wait! German! German, it's mine! Do you like it? It's mine. - How much does it cost? - It's not for sale. I want to buy it. And you need money. It's not for sale. It was painted for me. By the way, he wanted to give it to you as a gift at your concert. You wanted to sabotage my concert, kids? It really looks like him, right? Listen, let him buy it. How much will you pay? This is my painting. If you don't give it to me, you will not get money for the burial. Leave. Hey, father. Take the painting. You like money? Organize the burial as fast as possible. Call me. Father, wait. Thank you very much. Thank you, father. I really wish I had a father like you. Thank you. Stop it. (speaking foreign language) ...and they spat on him, and, having taken a cane, they beat him on the head. And when they had mocked him, they took off the purple from him, and put his own clothes on him, and led him out to crucify him. Upon coming out of the country they met one Simon a Cyrenian, who was passing by, he was made to carry the cross. And they brought him unto the place Golgotha, which means, the Place of Skulls. And they gave him to drink vinegar mingled with bile, but he received it not. The ones who crucified him, they parted his garments, casting lots upon them, what every man should take. And sitting they kept watch over him. And the superscription of his accusation was placed over his head: here is Jesus, King of Jews. (speaking foreign language) My son wanted to be an artist. And I knew that he simply did not want to work. He decided that I will always pay for him. I did not agree to that. Ten years ago he left home. (speaking foreign language) Lena, my wife, was alive back then. She always defended him. And he did not want to understand that art is work. Hard, agonizing work. I did not kick him out, he left of his own will. He left and came to hate me. Damn. He got lost. I don't know what he lived on. Got involved with some company. They kept flying to Goa, India. Somewhere else. Then they fought and he broke off from them. Moved to Jerusalem, got involved, entangled with you. You all drank, smoked, gobbled up all kinds of garbage. Made money selling that garbage. He too. Who am I talking to? You're one of them. Here, look. This is what he was. And what you have turned him into. Sasha. Sasha! A week ago he called. Again he asked for money. I refused to give him. He was really asking, but I did not give. I told him that I don't have a son. What are you looking at? You think that I killed him? Don't. Don't pity me. Go. Leave. Leave. Leave. Go home. Go home. Go home. Hello, Olga? Hello. I'm sorry for this late call. This is Alla. Remember, we met in the airplane? Yes. Do you want to speak to me about something? Yes, just... I don't even know how to say it. Say it how it is. Sergey invited you to come to a concert? Please, don't come. Why? Well, because you can see that he is attracted to you... Oh God, I can't anymore. I can't handle it. If he calls you, you tell him something... I don't know what. Some nonsense, I don't know... Please, forgive me. Alright. Listen. "From the heart it comes, to the heart let it go." Beethoven said that. Listen, I want to sing to you from the heart. May I stand here? Yes, go ahead. All beasts overcome by fear look upon Christ hanging on the cross, The sun darkened and all earth shook to its very core, All felt compassion for Creator, all did. One suffering for our sake, Glory be to God! Thank you. Enough. Alright. You will sing today. Vyacheslav Yurievich, did you really like it? Hello. Yes. One moment. Address? Give me the address! Yes. Alright. Don't start without me. I need to go. Vyacheslav Yurievich, should I get going then? Vyacheslav Yurievich, I'll get going then? Is it true that people in the group dislike me and hate me? You told me on the airplane... that everyone hates me. God forbid, Vyacheslav Yurievich. We, the whole group, really respect you a lot. Today I was thinking and... The whole night I was thinking about you. You know, despite everything, you are a good man. I will admit, earlier I used to think worse of you. Meaning... I thought badly of you. But right now it seems to me that I started to like you. I started to like you. - I'm leaving. - But wait, what about...? You asked such a big question. Vyacheslav Yur... I'm sorry. You see, I... I have never been to a burial. Only my father's. And that's it. No other time. Yes, yes. Let's go. When my friends passed away I always said: I am sick. And it's not because I am scared of death. Slava. I just don't like the dead. Slava. Understand? I hate them. - Slava, let's go. - I hate them, understand? Let's go. We need to. Everything will be OK. I'm with you. Let's go. No one should approach me. Yes, yes. Very well, Slava. Vyacheslav Yurievich does not want to talk right now with you and your friends. Then we understand each other. Tell him that my friends and I do not want to talk to him. Stop. Open the coffin. - Slava. - Open the coffin. - Slava. - Wait. That is not him. - Slava. - Why does he look like that? Let's go, Slava. That's not him. Let's go, Slava. What have you done to my son? That's not him. Give it to him. It's for him. ("Saint Matthew Passion" of Hilarion Alfeyev) (Symphony orchestra directed by Vyacheslav Petrov) Slava. I was asked to give you this letter. These friends asked me. I will put it on the table. Here you are. What are you doing here? - I am trying to make a call to Moscow. - To Moscow? Did the money run out? - To who? - Doesn't matter. Here, call from my phone. - No, it's fine. - Come on, call. - No, it's fine. - Why no? What nonsense! What nonsense! Let me dial it for you. I'll dial it and you will call. To Moscow. Hello. Hello. Why are you silent and breathing into the phone? I already told you that I have no intentions of talking to your husband. And I will not come to the concert. Please, don't call me anymore. Did you call? Happy? Yes? I don't love you. Seva. Senya. Seva, Senya! Seva, Senya. And behold, the veil of the temple was rent in two from the top to the bottom; And the earth did quake; And the rocks were rent; And the tombs were opened; And many bodies of the saints that had fallen asleep were raised; And coming forth out of the tombs after his resurrection They entered into the holy city and appeared unto many. Now the centurion, and they that were with him watching Jesus, When they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done, They feared exceedingly, saying, Truly this was the Son of God. And many women were there beholding from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering unto him. Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, And the mother of the sons of Zebedee. Seva. Senya. Hello. Olga? Who is it? What? What explosion? Wait! Wait! When I recently went inside the supermarket and asked, if they have bread, and they said they do have it, then I asked them to give me a chewing gum. The store clerk did not understand me. You and I also did not understand one another. Dad, I am sorry that I died. I won't do it again. I love you very much.
