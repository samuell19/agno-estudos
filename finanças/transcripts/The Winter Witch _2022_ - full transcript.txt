- All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. Is that enough? - Yeah. 'Can I keep this? 'Cause this is written by Richard. I can frame this, couldn't I? - Yep, that's how it'll all begin. Hello Princess. - Hello. - Are you watching the news? It's happened again. Another one. Can you meet? - Sure. Give me an hour. - Make it 30. Peace offering. - Something like that. I know what you're gonna ask me to do. - Oh. Your job. You're a reporter, so report. - Ronnie, I- - We're in trouble, Ingrid. The wolves are at the door, internet. It's about to finish us off unless we stay ahead. I know. We didn't see it coming. Should have. Should have, would've, could have. - Things are different now. I've got Eleanor to think about. - You're the only one that can do this. You're the only one with the inside knowledge. How long is it? - 20 Years? - 20 Years. Maybe some good can come of this for you. Cathartic. - Don't do that. - Do what? - Manipulate me. Don't bullshit me. - When you've been this game as long as I have, Ingrid, you get to know people. We need this exclusive. I'm not gonna lie. I wouldn't send you back in there if I didn't care. Talk it over with Frank. - Frank and I aren't- - Okay then, talk it over with Eleanor then. She's the sensible one anyway. Her mother's daughter. - Geography? - History. - Good girl. Hey, what do you think about going away for a few days? - Where to? - The countryside. - Like for an actual holiday or for work again? - Can it be both? - That's what you said last time. - Well, this time would be different. You can explore during the day while I work, and we can bring the laptop, watch movies in the evening by the fire. - The laptop? There's no television there? - No, not there. Back in time. - Somewhere you've been before? - Els, there's something that I need to tell you. - What is it? - Where we are going... Where we're going is where your great-grandmother used to live. - We're going to see Omi? - No, no. Omi has not been well for years. - So then why are we going? Because she's sick. - No. Have you seen anything on the news about those children? - Well, that happened near Omi's house. And when I was younger, something similar happened. - Huh? - My sister and my mom. - What is it? What are you afraid of? Don't you want to go? We don't have to go if you don't want to. - I'm sorry. You know I hate doing this in front of you. How did you get to be so wonderful? My little blonde miracle. - If you think it'll help, then we'll go. - Are you sure? - Yeah. Just me and you. - I'll look after you. I promise. - And I'll look after you. I promise. - Good evening. - Hi. I'm looking for Ronnie Taylor. - Certainly, sir. Follow me. - And you look like you've done well for yourself. - I'm sorry about Madison. - Yeah, me too. - Ingrid. - You've been looking out for her. - Hey, it's me. - Hey. I was hoping you'd call. I saw the news. I didn't know if I should... Is everything okay? How's Els? - We're okay. - Can I talk to her? Can I say goodnight? - No, she was tired. She's gone to bed. She was doing her- - History homework. It's always history on a Tuesday. - Listen, we're going away for a few days. - Where to? Ingrid? - Back there. - Is this Ronnie making you do this? You can't go back there. Not after what happened. And I won't let you take Els. - Frank, I have sole custody. I don't need your permission. I'm letting you know as a courtesy. - You're letting me know as a courtesy that you're taking our daughter back to where that happened. - I can't talk to you when you're like this. This is exactly why I needed space, Frank. - Is everything okay? Why are you shouting? - Is that her? Can I talk to her? - It's just work. Go back up and I'll tuck you in. - Are you sure? - I'll be right up. - And you really couldn't let me say goodnight to her. I can't talk you out of this, can I? Look, I'll call you tomorrow. - No, I'll call you tomorrow. We'll be traveling, I don't know... - I'll call you tomorrow. - Good night, Frank. - Things have changed, Eric. I'm getting sick to the back teeth of hearing it. - Is this it? - This is it. The rest of the way we take on foot. - We don't have to do this, you know. There was a hotel just up the road. We can stay there. - Come on. It'll be just fine. - How old is this place? - Old enough. - Gruesome, innit, huh? - I think it has a certain charm about it, which is more than what I can say for you. - And you, you must be Eleanor. Nigel Mortimer, I'm a good friend of your mum's. - Are you a reporter too? - Well, yes I am. What a lovely young thing. - What are you doing here other than trespassing? - Am I? Well, this place has been empty for a very long time, but I'm sure you can fill me in on the detail. - It's still my family's property. - Had trouble off loading it, have you ? - What do you want? - Just following a lead, Ingrid. Same as you go. - Go follow another one. Come on Els. Let's go inside. - Look, look, look I didn't mean to- - Don't bullshit her. - I've got a proposition for you. I just want talk to you about it. - I'm not interested. - You haven't even heard it yet. - She said she's not interested. - Come on. Let's go inside and get unpacked. - Look, look, are you still on the same phone number? I'll give you a call later. - Please don't. - It's just business, Ingrid. It's just business. I heard you could deal with it. It's just business. - This is nice. - No one's been here in a while. Not since. - I think we need to go shopping. - That's okay. There's somewhere we need to go anyway. - So it is true. You did come back. - I had to. - And did you come back because you heard about my accident, or because it was happening again, because of her. - You know, sometimes the longer you leave something, the harder it gets to come back. But I had to come back, Omi. - And are you going to write about it, or right a wrong? - I don't think what happened that night can be fixed. - Perhaps not. That night will never leave me. Once upon a time. Once upon a time in a little old house in the woods lived a woman called Ingeborg Hoffman. It was a cold, snowy winter's day, Christmas Eve, and her family were visiting her. Her daughter Rosemary, her son-in-law Lucas and their daughters, Hannah and Ingrid. It was going to be the perfect Christmas Eve. While Rosemary and Lucas were making hot chocolate in the kitchen, Ingeborg sat with her beloved granddaughters by the fire. "Omi, Omi, please tell us a story. And can we have a scary one?" So I said, "All right, just the one. And then it's bedtime." And I told you the story, the curse of Frau Perchta. The most feared and terrifying witch of the area. How she would capture badly behaved children, lip their stomachs open and fill them with pebbles and straw. And you said to me, how do I know so much about her? And I whispered, "Because I too survived as a little girl in Germany." - I couldn't sleep that night. That story terrified me. I left Hannah and went downstairs to get a glass of milk. And that's when I heard it. - Hannah didn't believe. And you did. That is why she went for her. I remember your parents running up the stairs, but it was too late. And your mother started to stop her from leaving, and she killed her too. As your father sat, cradling her in his arms during her final breaths, you and I ran into the forest, into the night. But you have forgotten my parting words to you. - No, I remember. - Run. Run and never stop running and don't come back. - Three children are dead. - Please tell me you didn't bring her. - It was the only thing left in the snack machine. - Omi, this is Eleanor. Your great-granddaughter. - You stupid, stupid child. - Is everything okay? - Hey everything's okay, honey. You go to the car, okay? - Are you sure? - Do as your mother says. Go, get out. - Omi! - And you too. Go. Go! And never come back! - Are you okay? - Yeah. Sorry baby. - Where did you go? - I was just thinking about Omi. I'm sorry you had to see that. She isn't well. - It's okay. - It's not though, is it? None of this is okay. I shouldn't have brought us here. - I said I didn't mind coming. And I meant it. - How'd you get so good at that? - We're survivors, aren't we? - We are. - It's okay if you wanna talk about it. Mom? - When I was your age, my sister Hannah, who was three years younger than me... We would come here every Christmas. Every Christmas, without fail with mom and dad to see Omi. Always the same. Around that fire, the same record on. The same sweets and chocolates. The same smells. Sometimes I think, what if we didn't ask to hear a story? Would she have heard us? Would she have heard Omi that night? - Frau Perchta? - Yeah. But she cursed this family long before that night. That's why Omi knew so much about her. She survived her as a child. Ask her where she got those scars, and she'll never tell another soul. Not after that night. Perchta told her, "Your scars have the power to remind you that the past is real. Never forget who gave you the greatest." And she never did. That night Omi told me, in the woods, to never return. I lost my entire family that night. Everyone I ever loved. - Not everyone. - Love you. - Love you too. - Are you hungry? - Always. - What do you fancy? - Pasta. - Obviously.

Claire Chandler, is that you? - You know it fucking is. What the fuck are you doing back here? - What? I came because- - Your family? Haven't you done enough damage? How many more, Ingrid? How many more people have to die? I bet she's still alive, isn't she? I hope she rots! Why are you back here in this house of all places? - Keep your voice down. My child is asleep upstairs. - Well, lucky fucking you. - Oh God. It was your son. - My son. His blood is on your hands. - Claire, please. Why don't you come inside? We can sit and talk. You're upset. - Sit and talk for one of your stories? I don't think so. Nobody wants you here. We don't want you here. That's what I'm here to say. Leave. Leave this town, leave my family and leave my daughter. She's all we've got left. You leave me with something. - Who was that? - I really do not appreciate you coming here like this. It is not graceful. But then I never had you down as a man of much decorum. - Look, I'm just trying to help. Your family has suffered enough over the years because of this story. - Story? You think this is a story? - Well, that's what it is. Isn't it? - The legend of Frau Perchta is as real as you and me sat here right now. I can assure you. - So are you trying to tell me that she's here in the room with us now? - Come on. - You would do well not to mock, Mr. Mortimer. She will not take kindly to it. - Well, I no longer a child. I'm a grown up, and I don't scare so easily. - And if you think she only takes children, you are making a grave error. - Hello. Hi, is this Mrs. Ward? Hi, can you put me through to the morgue please? I'll hold. Oh, Paul. Hi Paul. My name is Ingrid, Ingrid Hoffman. Would it be okay to ask you some questions on your friend, Ben. Ben Chandler. I was wondering if I could get some information on case number YXTZ-12? And has he been into the office since that note was left on his desk? Please let me know if anything upsets you. I was wondering, when was the last time that you saw Ben? I was wondering if you could gimme some information on the cause of death? Oh, hi, is that Mrs. Ward? Did you see anyone suspicious in the area? Did you see any, I don't know, anything suspicious? Anything that looked out of the ordinary? Well, I am the media and I don't have enough information. I'm a journalist. I'm writing about the recent death of Ben Chandler. Is there any information that's not classified in relation to the case? I'm just trying to obviously help and find out who's responsible. I believe he was your neighbour. Could you tell me a bit more about... a bit more about him? Could you tell me the last time that you saw him? Okay, all right. Thank you for your time. Useless. - Hey. - Did you have a good day? What did you get up to? - I went for a walk in the forest. - I hope you didn't go too far. Always make sure you can see the house. - I made a friend. - Okay, great. Who? - She said her name was Natalie. - Okay, cool. - She's all right, I guess. - Where'd you meet? She was just in the woods. - I think she was on a walk, but she's gonna come by tomorrow and we're gonna explore together. - Well, tell her to come in and say hi. - Okay. - So where are you guys from? - We're from West London. - Is this like completely different? - It's a lot more peaceful. And it's quieter. - How long will you guys be here? - I'm not sure. My mom was working on a story. - She's a writer, right? - A journalist. - So cool. What's it about? - Not sure if I'm supposed to say. - Is it about what happened here? - What do you mean? - Everyone in the village knows what happened here. Must get quite creepy at night. I wouldn't wanna sleep here. Do you wanna see where it happened? Do you have any brothers or sisters? - No. Do you? I had a brother. - Had? - He died. - Oh my God. I'm so sorry. - Why? It's not your fault, is it? - What? - It's not your fault my brother died, is it? You, your family? - I'm not sure what you mean. - Don't play dumb. The three kids that died here, the ones your mom is writing about. One of them was my brother. And you know how he died? It was her. It was Frau Perchta trying to bring her back to the village. I know your mom is the girl from the story. The one that got away. - I don't know what you're talking about. - So don't play fucking dumb. My brother said because your mom- - That's not true. - Family cursed this village. Now she's going come for you. You can run but you can't hide! Not from her. Not from Frau Perchta. No. Please don't hurt me. I brought her here for. I did it for you. - What is it? Els, what on earth's happened? Where? Stay here. - No, don't leave me! - I'm coming right back. I promise. I'll be right back. Okay? I'll be back. I'm coming right back. - Okay. - Is that you? It's been a long time! - How are you holding up? The family has been informed. Tragic. Only last week her brother. All these years, without anything like this. Not since your... And then you return and so do the killings. - I returned because of the killings. - And how exactly do you plan to explain this? The young girl, Natalie. - What do you want me to say? - Well, whatever it is, I'll need you to come to the station tomorrow morning, give a formal statement. Aren't you brave? Coming back here after what happened. - It's just a house. - Oh, it's way more than that, isn't it? This is a very old house, and old houses tend to have a lot of secrets. I'm gonna recommend you take your kid. - Eleanor. - Eleanor. - Eleanor. - Eleanor, and go stay at the hotel in the village tonight. It's not appropriate for her to be here. Get away from it for the night. Will do you some good, clear your head. And then you can stop by the station on your way to pick up your things. - Pick up my things? - Folks around here are sensitive with your family name. What's going on. - What are you saying? Are you threatening me, detective? - Do you hear me threatening you? - I'm a journalist. It's my job to read between the lines. - There is nothing for you here, Ms. Hoffman. I'll see you in the morning. I'm sure we'll be able to get things wrapped up promptly. Get you on your way. These woods are no place for a child. They should have let it burn. - Els, why don't you go play in the orchard for a bit? Don't go any further. Make sure I can see you. - Are you sure you'll be okay? - We'll be okay. - Go on. It'll be fine. - I'm so sorry. I can't begin to imagine what you're going through. - But you can, can't you. She took them from you too. Your family. - But not my children. No parent should ever have to bury a child. - Is someone there? You're not supposed to be here. How did you find us? - I just wanted to see you. I'm worried. Your mum. She's not answering the phone. Is she all right? Are you okay? - What'd you want? - She told you, didn't she? She told you what happened here to her. Did you go and see her? Did you go and see Omi? - She's sick. - Yeah, well, she's been sick for a long time. - No, she's really sick. - Look Els. You have to make her see sense. We've got to get out of here. All of us, together. Look, I'm sorry. I'm not trying to upset you. But if she told you what happened here, are you not scared? No. Of course you're not. But I mean it, Els, if any of it's true, you're both in danger. Els, look it's me. Come on. Els. Did something happen? What happened? - I can't talk about it. - Why can't you talk about it? - I never really believed it back then. We all thought your grandmother was mad, and it must run in the family. We used to joke about it. Me and the other kids. But no one's laughing now, are they? I believe you. How can we stop her? - Many have tried, I'm sure. She's existed for centuries. Millennia. - But why here? Why your family, this village? - She followed Omi. - I'm really sorry for what I said. I didn't mean it about Omi. God, I hope she didn't hear it. Your daughter. - I should check on her. Jesus Christ. - It's true. It's all true, and it's happening again? - I need to go. She told me not to talk about it. - To talk about what? Eleanor! Eleanor! Eleanor! Eleanor! - I told you to stay away. - I was worried. - What about, Frank? I looked after myself before you. I can look after myself after you. I can look after both of us, me and Eleanor. What the hell is your problem? - You're my fucking problem. You and her. - You said we can move past it. - Yeah, well, I guess that was just another thing I was wrong about. - This house is not safe for you or Eleanor, and you know it, and that's why you weren't here. - Jesus Christ. How long have you been following me this time? - Look, we can leave now. We can get in the car and we can go. - I have to stay. We have to finish this. - It's finished. It's over. Goodnight Vienna. They're all dead, Ingrid. Your sister, your mum and your dad. They're all fucking dead! - Goodbye, Frank. - I wondered if you might come. - It needs to end. I need to know how to break the curse. - The curse of Frau Perchta. And here was I thinking you were the wicked one. - I love them both. Please. You must know. - You think because I survived? No one survives Frau Perchta, not in the end. This is not a fairy tale. There is no happy ever after. You cannot come riding in here on your white stallion. - I want to save my family. - Oh. How noble. Pity you didn't think of that 18 months ago when... - For Eleanor. Please, Omi. What is it? - What are you doing here? - Look, I know you hate me and I hate myself. I've let you and Eleanor down and betrayed you. My best friend. - You've got two minutes. Well? - I love you. And I love Eleanor. I can't live without my family. - Well, you should have thought about that before. - Look, I know what shitty thing I done to you, but I was lonely and you were never there. I used to phone and phone. You and that bloody job. - So it's my fault. Jesus, why are you so needy? Big deal, I missed a few of your calls. I was working. I worked hard to make a name for myself so that people could look up to me and not gossip about what happened to me and my family. You don't understand. - I can imagine. - Why are you here? - I went to see Omi. - What? - I went to see Omi. - You shouldn't have done that. She's not well. - I'm not just gonna stand back and watch my family disappear. - There is nothing that we can do. Perchta can't be killed. - No, but she can be wounded. - What are you talking about? - What is it? It's Eleanor, isn't it? She's the key. - Yeah. Yeah, it is Eleanor that Frau Perchta wants. It is the natural order. Eleanor is the only one who can lift the curse. And I will not let you put at risk. - Tell me. - Oh, very well. The legend of Frau Perchta goes back many centuries and will continue for many more, because she cannot be killed. She is immortal. - But? - But she can be wounded by the wood of a special evergreen tree. And legend has it that once she is wounded, she will disappear for 12 years. And when she comes back, hopefully the curse will be obliterated. - How? - Again, legend dictates that Frau Perchta will not persecute those who wound her. - So it has to be her. It has to be Eleanor. - But are you willing to risk it? Again? - No. I won't put her in any more danger. - Look, I love her too. - She's all I have. - I'll do it. - Frau Perchta! Are you sure this is going work? - Omi said this is our only chance. - This is it. - This is it. - Frau Perchta! Frau Perchta! - Are you okay, darling? It's okay. It's over now. It's over. - Come on. Let's go. - Where were we going? - Home. Together. - Together or not at all. - Together or not at all. - Cheers. - Cheers. - We did it. Back on top where we belong. - I did it, Ronnie. And you are welcome. - You did. Your exclusive. You did it. Thank you, Ingrid. So how you doing? You still think about her? - Every day for at least 30 seconds. She'll always be with me. - I was so sorry to hear about Omi. - She carried on as long as she could. Our protector. Without her, all of this would... - The way you wrote about her. She's obviously quite the woman. - She was. To go on all those years with that heartache, but she carried on. - Well, that's what any of us would do, isn't it? We march on. Anyway, how's Eleanor? - She's doing much better. We all are. - Good. And you and Frank have managed to work things out? - We're getting there. Little by little, day by day. - Baby steps. Slow and steady wins the race, hey? Speaking of which. You thought more about our offer? The promotion. You earned it fair and square. I don't want to see it passed over with Jonathan. - You don't have to ask me twice, Ronnie. When do I start? - I'm glad you asked. - What is it? - A novelist. Harry Newman. Found dead in his flat last week in the south of France by his agent. Apparently lost his mind and... stabbed himself in the heart. - Apparently. - After seeing things, Things that go bump in the night. Remember Ingrid, no artist, no creator ever sets forth without hope. Even if the thing they create appears to be carved out of pitch black despair. Cheers.
