[old film projector] [music] Please hang up and try your call again. What time do we have to be there? Um, I think at three. [honks] Motherfucker! [narrator] Okay, let's begin with Marty and Alex. Or you know what, actually, you should first probably meet Isabelle and her husband, Ray. Then of course there's Miguel, who was in room 206 for some time. And of course Natasha and Carol over in 241. Okay, you know what? Just fuck it. I'm gonna toggle back and forth. The order does not matter. Each of these tales is as meaningless as the next. The point I'm trying to illustrate, if I may... ...is that as we journey through life, so much of it is tinged by what Jean Paul Satre so fondly refers to as"nothingness." I gotta go pee. There are much cuter places in the area, Ray. I looked it up. I was expecting something cuter. You know, all the gays live in this part of town. I think I have a UTI or a yeast infection or something. I mean, I'm having a problem every time I get the urge. I just have this funny little tingly feeling down there. Oh come all ye faithful, joyful and triumphant, oh come ye, oh come... [fart echoes] [begins to pee] Oh look, I can see myself in the mirror while I go to the toilet. [narrator] Isabelle and Ray have been married for two years at this point. They met after Ray bought what Isabelle now refers to as his "piece of shit car" and he wound up frequenting his father's mechanic shop. Thus, in a meeting of blind chance - Which Isabelle romanticized as fate - They begin dating and soon after married. [toilet flushes] Now, they've come to West Hollywood to visit Isabelle's cousin, Margaret, and her new "big-wig, producer boyfriend." Isabelle is hell-bent on making a good impression. Ray, who's financed this little adventure, couldn't care less. Okay, now let's go back and take a closer look at Miguel. He's recently come to Hollywood from Venezuela, and like most has a pocket full of dreams. Except, that is all that he has in his pockets. Hopefully I'm going to pay the deposit after the weekend. Meanwhile, I need to stay a few nights longer in this room. [narrator] He's been making money any way he can, All the while, desperately trying to keep a roof over his head. But I got a gig tomorrow. It should help me out a little bit. [narrator] And while growing more and more lonesome, wishes only for a true companion. [cell phone rings] Speaking of companions, let's take a look back at Marty and Alex. You hungry? So hungry. Let's go get dinner. Cool. I'm gonna grab a shower really quick. All right. Um, I'll... I'll go down to that liquor store and get us something to drink. Champagne or whatever. [cell phone rings again] Perfect. [instant message sounds] Are you ready? Yeah, just give me a minute. I have to download this song, and then I gotta make it my ringtone, and then I gotta take a shower. You still have to shower? Sorry. The password and username thing didn't work, so I had to call downstairs, and it took forever. All right, well, I'll pour us a couple glasses... Babe, we don't have time for that. Well, then would you hurry, please? You know, I thought you'd be ready. I am hurrying. [shower running] [muffled] I have a lot of anxiety... [narrator] While Alex showers, Marty begins to hear a voice from the adjoining room. [muffled] I had a really awful, awful childhood. I've never told you this before, but I was fat. I was huge, okay, I... Like, I had rolls. [chuckles] I know. The thing is, I have actually been on diet pills since the ninth grade. Anyway, I was fat, my parents separated, and I was very shy... Well, more or less I avoided speaking whenever possible... But, you know... I was bullied. I was bullied for being gay by my brother. No, he was also gay. [chuckles] I know, it's improbable, but it's not impossible. Hey babe, we might be meeting up with some people after dinner. Okay... Is this something you've already planned? Or... Well, no it's still up in the air. But probably, yeah. I've got friends out here, babe. I'd like to see them. It's not exactly what I had in mind for tonight, babe. I thought we'd... ...go to dinner, have some wine, I could look into your eyes. And we can do that, but after we go out. We've been invited. We've been traveling all day, Alex. I thought we'd just come back and snuggle up and watch a movie. You're such a lesbian. A lesbian? Yes, you never want to go out and you're always in bed by nine. Me? You're the one that sits there for hours watching things eat each other on Discovery Channel. That's educational. Oh. I mean, Christ, could you live a little? We're on vacation. All we ever do is watch movies. Well, I happen to like movies. I start feeling claustrophobic. I don't like to sit in bed and stare at something like I'm a zombie. Life's not a spectator sport. Well, you know, when I'm not slaving away at the hospital, I prefer to stay in and relax. I don't understand why you can't go out and relax. Where do people go out and... Like here, where would people go out and relax? Akbar. It's in Silverlake. Okay... You know that Thomas thinks that you're an agoraphobic? Exactly - because agoraphobics often choose to work with cancer patients. You know what I think? I think Thomas wants to get into your pants. Oh, God, Martin. Could you not be gross? Do you deny? You know, he stares at you. He mentally undresses you. He does not. That's his normal look. That is not his normal look. If he looked at me like that, I'd expect a sext message not long after. You don't trust me. That's what it all boils down to. What does that have to do with anything? Because you don't have faith in anything. You don't have faith in me, in us, in other people... I'm surprised you're not an atheist. Well, my skepticism keeps me from being an atheist. Look, I'm not gonna have another one of these drawn out conversations with you. I refuse to stay in on our first night here. It's absolutely ridiculous. Are you gonna come or not? No. All right, well, don't wait up then. [door opens and shuts] This isn't working. What? It's not working. What do you mean? I don't feel anything. Well, maybe you need a tune-up. Carol, I'm being serious. I am not turned on at all. Really? No - uh, yeah. I don't know what's wrong. I'm sorry, I just... completely took the mood away. It's okay. I'm just gonna... I'll be right back. [narrator] Okay, you see, Natasha and Carol have found themselves in a bit of a rough patch. Natasha's been somewhat distant. A little, you know, closed off... ...leaving Carol, her ever dutiful lover, confused and frustrated. [toilet flushes] Carol? Hmm? Do you think I'm getting fat? No! I think you look amazing. Yeah? You still think so? Yes. You know I wanted you the first time we met. What did you think? Of you? Yeah. When we first met? Yeah, what was your first impression? You know. I've told you. Well, tell me again. What was yours? Of you? Yeah. I thought you were a bore. Yeah? [laughs] What about before that? When you first saw me? I thought your uniform fit well. And? [laughs] I thought... you were a klutz. You spilled that drink on the guy seated in front of me, so... Well, I had noticed your cleavage. But then... I thought you were pretty. With, or without cleavage. I thought you had a nice smile. What else? I thought you were cute. What else? I thought it would be nice to kiss you. [alarm rings] Shit, I've got to go. You're setting timers now? Well, I told Jake that I was going to the movies, so... ...if I'm gone longer than three hours, he'll begin to worry. Or, at the very least, wonder where I am. He's gonna find out sooner or later. Why don't you just tell him? We've been deeply in love for two years now... what else do you need? Okay, okay... Okay, you're right. But... I mean, do you think this is easy for me? I just want what's best for everybody. Which is what exactly? Well... I'm trying to make it as an actress, you know that, and... Jake's my husband, he's supporting me... And I'm supporting you. Yeah. Putting me up in this motel, keeping my from flying... What do you want? I want what you told me you wanted... to be together. Otherwise, I... I might as well kill myself. Please. don't be so middle class. Look, I'll try to get away... tomorrow. I'll tell him I have an audition. All right. That doesn't sound very all right. [kiss] I'll see you later. I'm gonna leave some money on the table for you... Have you seen my ring? Its over there. All right! Okay! [narrator] After a pseudo-authentic Mexican dinner, Isabelle and Ray prepare for bed. Is there a 'Do Not Disturb' sign? It's on the latch. What? The deadbolt. Turn it to the right. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, look. If you turn it the other way, it says 'Maid Requested.' We should dirty up the sheets... Uh-huh. Ray! Do not walk barefoot on that rug. God knows what's on it. I packed an extra pair of slippers for you in the bag. Which bag? That red piece of shit bag. [brushing] I think I'm gonna light the Bettie Page incense. C'mon, come here. Smell this. Bettie smells spicy. Very nice. Hendrix smells like an Indian food restaurant. Where's my head? What? My wig head. [narrator] Okay, yeah, you know what? I'm a shitty narrator. I should have mentioned this earlier. Isabelle had cancer. She went through chemo, the whole shebang. Everything's fine, it's all good... But now that her hair's grown back... She's still wearing those wigs. Ray doesn't understand it, but he tolerates it. Most of all, he's glad that she's back normal... Except for the aforementioned issue she's been having every time she sits down to pee... It's actually been ongoing since the radiation... Ray! What! [narrator] However... What is it? [narrator] Isabelle hasn't really admitted to it until now. What... is that? Oh! That's a... A penis! A penis! Yes, uh-huh! Where did it come from? Why is it on me? I don't know! Oh, God! Do you think it was something I ate? This just isn't possible! I told you I shouldn't eat spicy food, Ray! [door closes] Hey, hey... This is my room! No, this is my room... I just checked in! That's a mistake, I have not checked out! But, but they took my deposit, and they gave me a key! But I have not checked out! You see, um, okay... I just used the last bit of my cash for this place. But I have not checked out. Can they give you another room? There are no more vacancies. And I'm pretty sure if they gave me a key and took my deposit, you're already supposed to be checked out, buddy. Look, okay, I'm sorry. I don't have the energy to fight right now. Do you think... Could I please just use your phone for a minute? My phone died and the airport lost my bag and my charger's in my bag and right now I just need to contact somebody... They'll find it. That's what they are good at. That's... nice of you to say. But, you know, I wasn't expecting to check a bag and they made me check a bag unexpectedly and I have a lot of things in that bag that I need. You know, I have a job interview on Monday and... Yeah, no problem. Use the phone. Thank you, thank you, thank you so much... It will just be a minute and I'll be out of your way and I can just ask for my deposit, right? [dial tone] I'm Victor, by the way. [dialling] Okay, so what does that mean that it's not in lost luggage? That it's just, that it's just lost? Yes, I've tried calling back, and I'm calling back right now. I even spent an hour in... Okay, uh, all right. I'll just call back then. Thank you. [hangs up] Fuck! A beer? Oh, no. No, I shouldn't drink. Actually... I thought you said you didn't drink. I said I shouldn't drink. [narrator] I'm fairly certain you can guess what happens next. I don't think I have to lay it out for you. Well, the heart wants what it wants... There's no logic to it. You meet someone, fall in love, and that's that. Yeah, but you're not in love. You're miserable, and not in a good way. I mean, I'm sure the sex is great, right? But a healthy, equal relationship this is not. I guess it would appear that I'm doing all the heavy lifting. Marty, what you need from a man is your intellectual equal. Not some freshman who paid the equivalent of a mortgage to see Madonna in concert. Look, thanks for the talk. I just... I think I'm gonna get into bed, turn on a movie, and take an extra Seconal. Did you get any premium channels with the room? Uh... HBO, I think. I dunno. I think I'm just gonna stream something offline. In that case, I have a recommendation for you. It's a romantic comedy, but... But you have to go into it blind and with a detached attitude. [music] I dunno. I'm not into group activities. I was an only child. So, who was it? Someone he met at work. Co-worker? Patient. Some twink. Urologist? Plastic surgeon. I guess he was proud of his work. Men are fucking assholes... [narrator] Marty can't help but be attracted to Trevor, the handsome lead, and wish that he own boyfriend were more of a romantic. [music] You need to call the front desk and talk to the manager. Why? Why! Because I spent a night in their motel room and I woke up with a penis! That's why! There must be something in the water, or in those nasty sheets! Isabelle, they're not going to refund my money because you now somehow have a penis! You know, to them, you're just another chick with a dick! [gasps] You do realize how often they probably see that around here... I need to find my Trazodone. Why... is it up? That usually happens in the morning. Well, how do I make it go down? I don't... Just think about puppies. I think it's bigger than yours. That's great! It's got a mushroom head. Like a shiitake. Well? Nothing. Nothing still? Not a thing. Well... we have been kinda going through the motions lately. You're always so pressed for time. I don't think that's it. I mean, I usually work very well under pressure, you know that. Natasha, I wish we could just go away on a trip. You're always so much more relaxed on trips. Well, we can't. Then I guess we better liven you up down there. Thoughts on how to do that? I've got some Cholula sauce in the fridge. Carol! Okay, I'm thinking... Sit on my face. What? Sit on my face. It's not like you haven't done it before. Well... yeah, but you... That just happened! You telling me to do it is... I dunno, it's different. Natasha! Sit. On. My. Face. [music] [television] You know, this is a really unusual circumstance and, um... I just hope that... We can just forget what happened last night, it just never happened... Right? [television channel changes] Um... Hey. Excuse me? Hello? Hi. You have a boyfriend? No! [chuckles] No, I don't have a boyfriend. So, why do you feel so guilty? I don't... I don't feel guilty. I just... Uh, I dunno... I just... I've just never slept with a stranger before. Never? No. Not even one night stands? Nope. So, um... So, we can just forget what happened last night? Just never happened. Right? Yeah, no problem. [television channel changes] No problem... Really? Yeah, it's okay. Whatever you want. Okay, just... [snaps fingers] like that? Forget about it? And move on? Am I supposed to be crushed? Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. No, no- Thank you. Ow! Oh, God! Ow, ow, ow... I slipped! I am so sorry... And kneed me in the eye! Is it all right? -I don't know! I'll be able to tell you once I can open it again, God... [alarm ringing] Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit. I gotta go, Carol! What? I gotta go! I told Jake that I had an audition. He's gonna get suspicious. How much longer is it gonna be like this? What? Your eye or my pussy? This! You, me, this! How much longer is it going to be like this? Like what? When are you gonna tell him? I'll... I'll... you know, I'll tell him... when the time is right. I'm at the lowest point of my life, Natasha! I've given up things for you! I've given up my career, I live in this freaking motel! What are you looking for? My, um... My, my... Your ring? Yes! It's right here! Okay! Um, you know what, here... You know, I'll... I'll... I'll come back later, if... if I can. I'll come back later. You will. What? You will come back later. Will I? I know where you live... and I have your landline in my cell. How long have you had these threats in your back pocket? These... these threats! You've been my entire life for two years, Natasha. I am completely and utterly devoted to you, and I'm not going to be tossed aside. And I'm not gonna let you go without a fight. Oh, nobody is talking about giving anybody up. You're so dramatic, Carol. I mean, of the two of us, you... you should've been the actress. You undoubtedly have more feelings. [door opens] [door closes] [traffic, construction] [door opens] Hi. Are you better today? Yeah, I'm fine. Good. Did you have fun? I did actually. My back has been acting up again though. Probably didn't help that I slept on Kevin's couch. The couch? That's where you slept? Yes, babe. Well, you know, if you slept in the bed, you could just tell me. God, Martin, please. I could use one of your special rubdowns... My feet are killing me to. I should not have worn those shoes. So, is that your way of saying you're too sore to leave the motel today? No, but one of your massages would help. Are you saying that you're actually up for leaving the motel today? I was up for leaving the motel last night, Alex. Could've fooled me. I just wasn't up for company. Right, because you have a problem with live humans. Did you drink the champagne? No, I did not. Um, I did, uh... I found a joint in the medicine cabinet though. You didn't smoke it, did you? No, why? Would you like to? No, God! It's probably laced with something bad. Are you hungry? A little, yeah. There's supposed to be a continental breakfast down in the office. God, no... It's probably Cork Flakes... stale toast. No. I could go down there and check out the situation. Wouldn't you rather just go to Starbucks and get a venti and a cranberry bliss bar? Sure, why not. Cool. I'm gonna grab a shower really quick, and then we can go. [shower water] Care to join? [shower water] Thank you for calling. All of our representatives are engaged with other calls at the moment. Please hold. [television] [music] Margaret! Hi, it's Isabelle. Hi, Isabelle... What time are you coming over? I don't think that, um, we can come over today... Um... What? Well, it's just, um... I'm not feeling like myself. I don't know what it is... Maybe it's the Swine flu or jetlag or, um... Swine flu? Something like that. It's just, um... What the fuck are you talking about? This is a huge disappointment, Is. I know, I... You don't want to see my new house? Is that it? Of course I really want to see your new house, and um, and meet your producer boyfriend, but um... Look, trust me, it's not a good idea. Not today. I could be contagious. Contagious? Maybe we should reschedule for the next time we're in town. Fine... Okay? Is Ray putting you up to this? Yeah. All right. All right. Well, tell Ray I said hello. I'll tell him. [door closes] I love you. I love you, too. Bye. Bye. Where the hell did he go? [traffic] Romantic possibilities seem most favourable at this time for those of your sign. But beware of complications. Think with your wits, more than your heart. Thank you. Oh. Are you still here? Ray! Where the hell are you? [music] [television] We're never going to find anything to watch. There's too much to choose from. Ha. I'm being sarcastic. But this is nice, right? Just... sitting here, talking? I guess so. It's so pretty out, Carol. And I'm in a position to enjoy it? We could at least lie by the pool. You could get a tan. I don't tan. I contract malignant melanoma. This room is a petri dish for allergies... Oh! How about California Suite? Seems appropriate. Jane Fonda's in it. Jane Fonda? Remember that song? Hampton. So, what happened with that guy? Oh, nothing. Our clothes came off and we spooned a little. That's it? He was wearing a diaper! What! He was... Did he have a changing table too? [laughs] I don't know. I was just really trying not to be judgmental. You know, it takes all kinds, and... people are into different things. Right. I'll be back. Where are you going? I need a cigarette. [door opens anb closes] What was I saying? Takes all kinds, people into different things... But, I mean, given the situation... you would say he's the freak, right? Oh, no... Once he found out that I had done porn, he was the one calling it off. You're joking... I wish I was. What a jerk. No... I'm a failure. Scott... You bring pleasure to many, many, many people. That is not such a bad thing. Carol, a man who wears Pampers and soils himself won't even date me. Yeah, well, try dating a married woman... for, like, two years... I still win. -I know. [channel changes] You know, I used to watch her sleep... When we'd go on trips, I would watch her fall asleep because that was the only time that we could fall asleep next to each other... So I'd just watch... Except for that one time she woke up, saw me, and screamed. [chuckles] That wasn't good. [television] [channel changes] You know, I have a friend coming over now... So... so, what does that mean? Does that mean I have to go? Yeah, you should probably go... ...unless you wanna make some extra bucks. Some extra bucks? How? [porn sex sounds] Oh! Hi, Ray! Isabelle? I was just cleaning. Cleaning? Yeah... What the hell is this? Are you kidding me? What? You were seriously watching that! You were getting off! Oh, don't be ridiculous... I can see plain as day! You're aroused! Well, I've never had one of these before! I gotta figure out how it works! What you need to figure out is how to get rid of it! Get rid of it? Well, why don't you go out there, and grab a meat clever, and chop it off! Turn your wife into a Munich! First of all, it's eunuch. Secondly, shut the fuck up! These walls are thin. Are you embarrassed by my penis? I just liked what you had... a lot! Well, then order me a vaginoplasty or shove my fat ass into a time machine, because this is what I have now! [porn sex sounds] It could change back... Improbable, I know, but... the fact that this happened is pretty fucking improbable, so... A watched pot never boils. What? Me sitting around here all weekend, staring at it- it's not going to change a thing. Boiling pots have very little to do with subatomic particle movement. I don't care! You need to take me to dinner! We need to go out... go dancing or something. We gotta forget all about this penis... thing-y. Isabelle, I don't think I have much of an appetite right now. We gotta eat. Are you gonna... I used this hand. Are you gonna leave me? Because I don't have a vagina no more? Because that's what it seems like! It's seems like you're gonna leave me! I mean, you just up and left a little bit ago... Isabelle, I just had to go clear my head. What if it doesn't change back? Stop it. [music] [traffic] [phone rings] Hey, babe? We have another invite for tonight. Are you joking? What? You're kidding right, Alex? I mean, we came here to spend time together. We've been spending time together. Yeah, well, I don't understand what all the urgency is... I'm assuming that was Kevin. There is no urgency. He's my friend. Well, like I said, we came here to spend time together... as a couple. And we are a couple and we're still gonna be a couple when we go out with Kevin and his friends. It's not very romantic. Well, I guess if there's anything worse than a hopeless romantic, it's a hopeful one. What is romantic to you, Marty? You want to go out to dinner, and then we're gonna take this long walk, we're gonna end up back at the motel watching another movie. I mean, it's the same, redundant thing over and over again. Honestly, I'm sick of it. We're on vacation, we should try something a little bit different. You're just sick of me. Oh, my God... Well, you just won't admit it... Martin, please do not start... So... if I decide to stay here and opt out... you're just gonna go and leave me here alone in the motel room again? You're so fucking theatrical. Do you realize that you always play the victim? It's always about what you want. No - actually, Alex - it's always about what you want. And... you typically get what you want. So, just go. Go out. Go... You're so complicated. You make it so hard to be your boyfriend sometimes, honestly... [door opens and closes] Say, say, oh playmate, Come out and play with me. And bring your dollies three. Climb up my apple tree. Slide down my rainbow Into my cellar door. And we'll be jolly friends Forevermore Cut! [from phone] Say, say, oh playmate, Come out and play with me. And bring your dollies three. Climb up my apple tree. Whew! Sure beats looking at a bunch of vaginas that look like the inside of a hot pocket! [laughs] [music] Thank you for calling... All our representatives are engaged with other calls at the moment. Please hold. Any luck with your bag? No... they've got me on hold again. [narrator] Miguel once again has Victor all to himself. The question is: will he be as lucky tonight? If I go to pick us up some dinner, are you gonna lock me out of my room? [chuckles] No... All of our representatives are engaged with other calls at the moment. [music] [television] I'm not into group activities. I was an only child. So, who was it? Someone he met at work. Co-worker? Patient. Some twink. Urologist? Plastic surgeon. I guess he was proud of his work. My God, you must really love this movie. I've seen you here twice now. Trevor, what are you doing? [water] [music] Trevor just came out of the movie, Dawn! Listen to me... It's physics. It's metaphysics... people just don't appear. There's no good explanation. And you're a sweet guy... you deserve a human. My father always wanted a boy... Oh, God. Don't... Isabelle, don't... Please don't rationalize this. Aren't you always saying that things are meant to be? That things happen for a reason? Like if you hadn't bought that piece of shit car and came into my father's shop, we would have never met... That was meant to be. Yes, it's a nice thought, but... Ultimately it's luck. No, Ray... it is fate. Yes, and fate is luck. What? It's all blind chance. We're lucky... that's all. So, you're telling me... that this giant cock and low-hanging set of balls... that's just luck, Ray? Trevor! Get back here! We're in the middle of a story - we don't have time for this! No, go on without me. How am I supposed to go on without you? I'm a dramatic character, I need... forward motion! There is no story now... Improvise, Juan. Aren't you tired of doing the same thing every couple of hours? I mean, I'm tired of hearing your sad story. You play the victim so well. Excuse me? Okay... I've been on hold for the last 24 hours and you still can't find my bag? Is it really that difficult? Uh-huh? Yes, it's a black bag. Yes... Okay, well, why can't it be found? Why is it really that difficult to just... Okay... Okay. Yes, yes... Sounds... okay... Tomorrow? Okay! Okay, I'll... I'll call again. [music] What are these cups for? Do you... have anything to drink? Oh, well, there's, um... There's some champagne in the fridge. Champagne? Is it New Years? Uh... yeah, almost. Do you, uh, have anything to eat? Are you hungry? I'm actually starved. Me and Juan usually have dinner. That's when I usually eat. Oh. Um... Well, I, uh... I have a breakfast bar in my carry-on... Uh... Actually, we could... We could order something in, if you want. Do you like Chinese? I love it. Yeah, I've... I've seen you... eat it a few times. [knocks at door] [door opens] Finally! What, am I late? Not if we're going by the current local time in Hawaii. Well, I only have a few minutes. Have you been putting ice on that? A few minutes? Yeah, look... Jake's acting awfully suspicious. Talk to him! Have an open exchange... that's how you work things out. And I'm going to do that... But, until I do that... I was thinking... that maybe we should, you know... cool it. Natasha... The last time you said that, I didn't see you for two months! That is not true... Yes, it is! Because texting me that you're down the street in line at Starbucks with your husband doesn't exactly count! You saw me. You're driving me crazy! I'm sorry, okay? We only have a few minutes, let's make the best of it. Why only a few minutes? Because I told Jake I was going to make dinner, and I had to go grab a few things. You make dinner? Yeah, sometimes. I didn't even know you could cook! I'm not like a culinary genius or something! What do you cook him? What do you make for him? Nothing special... Well, what are you making tonight? Sea bass. Oh, my God... It's over baked, Carol! It's simple! Don't take it so personally... Natasha! [door knocks] Natasha, I know you're in there! Hide. Hide! Where? Just go to the bathroom... Go, go, go! Go to the bathroom and lock the door! Natasha, open up! Stop yelling! Where is she? Who? I told that little dyke if I caught her messing around with you again, I was gonna show her what's what! I don't know what you're talking about... Don't bullshit me, Natasha! She's not here, okay? I swear it. Who are you? See! I told you she wasn't here. Is this another one? Another one what?... No! No, no... Um... Carol... Carol, this is, um... Uh... Carol, do you mind if I tell him? Be my guest. Carol is a friend of mine, Jake... and she is running away from her abusive ex- boyfriend, and I'm just here to help her. Is this true? Look at her face, Jake! He... He beat her and he raped her! He raped her over and over again! I didn't even resist... See! I had no one else to turn to. I'm sorry, I... I... Ssshh! Are you okay, honey? Do you need anything else before I go? I'll just... um... I'll go wait in the car. Yeah, you do that! You know, I'm gonna leave you some money, and if you need anything... you know, you just... It was nice to meet you, Carol. [door closes] Oh, God that was close. Are you fucking someone else? What? No! You swear? Get that thing out of my face. I'll text you later. I hope he enjoys the sea bass! Would you stop? Ow! [door slams shut] [music] Stop pacing! Ray... what if there's a higher power at work here? Isabelle, that's enough! What if this means that I am meant for greater things? Like what? A career in special interest porn? How many women just up and grow penises? You never hear about that... especially not here in America! That's right! Because it's not medically possible! So you admit it! You agree... this is a miracle! What are you getting at? Just what are you saying? I'm saying that we have a real... That God bestowed upon you the male reproductive organ for some great purpose? I'm saying... if you let me fucking talk... that this is something special here! We have something that very few people get... One word... Opportunity. Oh, no... I could be on the cover of Time Magazine. No! Or of People. Maybe the Enquirer. [music] You know, I... I don't understand, you know... I still don't understand why you're here. I'm in love with you. That's... that's ridiculous, Trevor. That's movie talk. It's true, don't you share my feelings? No. I mean, how could I? Trevor, you're some kind of apparition. Besides, I have a boyfriend. Jeez... I mean, I'm crushed. I'm sorry. Well, where is he? Where is this boyfriend? Uh... He's out. We... we needed some time apart. We... took a fucking vacation to spend some time apart. So things must be hard? Things have been hard for everyone... You know, living in a world with no jobs and wars... You probably haven't even heard of the War on Terror. Naw, I missed it. Yeah... I mean, here people... People get old, people get sick, and they never find true love. Where I'm from, people are reliable... things are consistent. Well, you don't find much of that here. Does your boyfriend make you happy? Yeah... yeah, I guess he does sometimes. He can be pretty sweet. But, uh... I guess I'm not a walk in the park myself. He's right... I can be pretty complicated. [music] What are you reading? Oh, I'm not reading it. I mean, it's pretty customary. It comes with every motel room. What is it about? About? It's about everything... It... It explains how we got here. It gives life meaning. Meaning? Uh, yeah... Imagine a movie without a purpose or a happy ending. That's what life is like without that book. I would think unconditional love would give life meaning. Yeah, I mean, it's a pretty good illusion. But, you know, even Shakespeare said, "Life is full of sound and fury, and in the end, signifies nothing." I don't know about this Shakespeare guy, but isn't life too short to be worrying about all of that? Yeah... Yeah, I guess it is. I'm starting to feel pretty awful about the way I did Juan. I guess... I don't know, I just had this urge to branch out and try new things. Well, I mean, that's... that's the human condition, Trevor. I can't imagine Alex being the entire story for me. I had many experiences before Alex, and... I guess the harsh reality is that I'll have many experiences after Alex... But you... Juan is all you've ever known, and ultimately when you go back, is all you'll ever know. I don't ever want to go back though. Well, you'll have to. Trevor, take it from me... this place is not all it's cracked up to be. It's pretty grim out there. I guess you're right. But, you know... while you're here... There's no reason why we... Why we can't try and fix you up with somebody... for the night, at least... How would we do that? Thanks to technology... and I'll have to figure it out, because I've never used it... but there's this thing called Grindr. How does it work? Well, it's a homing device for gay guys. It shows you were all the gay guys are in the area... and, believe me, in this part of town there are a lot. And they're all on there looking for the same thing... We'll get you set up on there. But we're gonna have to take a few photos first. [bed squeaks] [Victor moans] Ow! Wait, wait, wait... Okay, I'm good. [Victor moans] You're so handsome. I love your eyes. They're so shiny. [music] I'm horny. Great. I didn't get a chance to finish earlier. You came in before I came. So sorry to have interrupted. You wanna have a go at it? Do I wanna have a go at it? Yeah. -No. No? -No! Why not? Because, I'm sorry, I'm not one of those guys... I didn't even experiment in college. You never thought about another man's genitalias? No! [music] If you have any repressed desires... now would be the time to, you know, act on it. [bed squeaks] [Miguel and Victor moan] And you'd be having sex with your wife, so it wouldn't be a sin in God's eyes. Okay. Okay, well, what do you want me to do Suck it? Ride it? You don't have to be gross, Ray. You don't love me anymore? You're gonna walk out on me? Where are you going? To the liquor store! [door closes] [traffic] [phone rings] Hello? Hey. I'm just reading over some lines. I've got an early call tomorrow. Wait, what? Hold on - why would I post pictures of myself on a gay dating site? Blogs? Okay... Yeah, I'm looking. What the fuck is this shit? [music] [door closes] Hi. -Wow. Are we, um... Is this a group activity, or? Oh, no, no, no. I just wanted to make sure he'd be okay. He looks okay to me. All right, well, um... You two have a good time and send up a smoke signal when you're done. A what? So... what would you like to do? What would you want me to do? Honestly, I want you to fuck the shit out of me. Wow. You're really blunt. You wanna tie me up? Why would I want to do that? Don't be afraid to tell me you're into something kinky. For you, I'd lick the pavement. Well, let's see... I have this lube and I have this condom. Well, aren't you prepared? Is there anything else we'd need? Do we really even need that? I mean, I'm clean... Are you clean? Yeah, I just took a shower. [laughs] No, I mean, I'm disease free. You are too, right? Well, I would imagine... I could have some kind of virus. If I've got some doppelganger running around West Hollywood, hooking up with random dudes, we've got to put a stop to it. Yeah, you saw what happened to John Travolta and the fucking Elmo guy. This is all my fault. There is nothing to regret or feel sorry for. You are too hard on yourself. You couldn't help yourself. I couldn't help myself? You're not all that irresistible, you know? I didn't mean it like that... In fact, I did have a lot to do with decision, I assure you. You took that the wrong way. In fact, you had very little to do with this decision! Very little? Yes! You're a piece of work. Oh, am I? Yeah, you're telling me that you'd fall into bed with the first person to give you a beer? I'm... I'm sorry. You wanna dance? No. Yes. [music] Wow... I mean, that was... I mean, I've... I've never had it like that before... ever. Like, ever! [laughs] With Juan it was always the same... always underneath the covers. It never even lasted very long. Thank you. I don't even know your name. It's Joel. Joel... What do you do, Joel? Well... [music] I can't believe I'm doing this... I never leave home without it. Has anyone ever told you you look like that actor? It's uncanny. -Which actor? I'm trying to think of his name. He's not too famous... yet, anyway. He was in that indie rom com last year... it was like his breakthrough role. He played a gay guy. Anyway, now he's doing one of those action adventure trilogies based on a series of books... [door opens and closes] Hi. -Hi. Doesn't he remind you of that actor? What's his name? Oh, shit. "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Gay Sex But Were Afraid to Ask." It's only ten bucks for the Kindle, Ray. What a steal. Oh, look! It'll let me take a peek inside for free... Okay. Here's a good one... Are people's butts built differently? My boyfriend can swallow dining room furniture while I struggle with his average size dick. What's average? Am I average? You're... above average. A fraction of an inch feels like a foot in your ass. I'll stick it in slowly. Jake insisted I bring you leftovers. I like him already. He also insisted that I invite you to come live with us. We have two very lovely guest rooms. I recommend the one with the picture window. So... you'd prefer I play along with this? Is that what you want to do? To further deceive your husband? Not just tell him that we're more than friends... I just want what's best for everyone. Well, this is not what's best for me. Or for him... -if he knew the truth... If you were living with us, we wouldn't have to sneak around. We would see each other all the time. I think your ears are broken too, Natasha, because you're not hearing what I'm saying. Are they somehow connected to your vagina? This is really hard for me. I know it is. This isn't working. Don't say that. What else is there to say? It's just... it's not working. I think... I think we're both just tired... It's been a long day. Trevor, you have to go back. Why? Because there'll be trouble if you don't. You're someone's creation. You are essentially a double of another person out there with a life, and a career... A career that you could jeopardize by sleeping with people like Joel. Wow. For a second, things were really great. [music] And that's life. What doesn't kill you... defines you. Trevor... Please try and understand... You'll be fine. In your world, things always have a way of working themselves out. Here it's not so easy. You know, my taxi should be here any minute, so maybe I should head out. Are you okay to get to the airport? Yeah, yeah... I'll be fine. I had a great time. Yeah, me too. If you are... -It was nice meeting you, Miguel. Thank you. [muffled] I know... the human condition is discouraging. [door opens and closes] You're back? Yep. You didn't want to make a night of it? Well, you know how it is. I mean, Kevin's pretty awesome, but his friends are just so banal. I can only pretend to care what happened on the last episode of X Factor for so long. And... honestly, babe, I missed you. It's not the same without you. [music] Yeah? Yeah. Everyone kept asking me where my boyfriend was. What'd you tell them? That you weren't feeling well. Why do you have to be so complicated? Do you want to watch a movie? I'm actually tired of watching movies. Excuse me? Okay, well, how about me pop open that bottle of champagne? Oh, I... I drank it. You drank it by yourself? Uh-huh. Martin? Uh-huh? What the hell is this? [music] [knocks] How'd you figure it out? Well, after I met you... saw the two of you together... and got back to the car... I just started putting the pieces together. Like, if you were really friends - why had I never heard your name mentioned before? And if Natasha was really helping you - why weren't you staying with us? Besides, you don't say you're going to the grocery store and then drive the opposite direction to a motel. Don't let... Don't let your life pass you by, Carol... Not for her. Why don't you leave her? We've been married for ten years. The roots run deep, you know? It's harder for me. Plus... divorce in California? No. You've met my wife. She's not cheap. Yeah, those panties don't come from Wal-Mart. [chuckles] What is it? I was just thinking how strange life is. [music] Why did you do that? Why not? But you're a... And I'm a... Well, I like women too, so... I know, but fuck it. I haven't had a dick in like ten years. All right. [music] Ray! -What? [toilet flushes] What happened now? It's gone! What? -It's gone! I ain't got a penis no more! Talk about a deus ex machina. But what was this all for? What does this mean? Well, if anything this should prove how much I love you. I'm so confused. I feel like there's something missing. Maybe it's under the bed. [music]
