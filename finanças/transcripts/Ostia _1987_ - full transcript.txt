Who was I? What meaning did my presence have at the time which this film would be, sadly, beyond time. Now recalls ..the importance to remember one must never be afraid to use the power of culture I think the sort ahead is this stage of possibilities that exist. What comfortable hole is this, the clarity and the sensity of what has to be said and that was never be betrayed in anyway and, least of all, by remaining silent But, having said this I think that afterwards it's important to be able to take stock of the greed which one can possibly be used by the integrating power and then if one's own sincerity and necessity have been taken over and manipulated I think we will simply have the courage to reject them. Being a poet because life is expressed only with itself I'd like to express myself by example to throw my body into this struggle In a dream I had departed you Ninetto I was about to drive off in my car and you said to me: "Hey Paul take me with you will you pay my way?" The journey you want me to pay for was the journey of life and in that dream I realized what was the opposite of my ambigous love for freedom Now that you no longer love me Nino I fearfully take the plane for a distant place I'm insatiable for our life, for something unique in all the world never be replaced I was watching some boys today when I came to pick you up They reminded me of the theme in Greek tragic theater where sons were predestined to pay for the sins of their fathers I, as part of their fathers generation, I'm responsible We're responsible for fascism and we are now guilty for accepting the new form of power the final ruin the ruin of ruins the power of consumerism. I condemn those boys because of what they have become and because I can no longer love them but I have not the least doubt that it's my fault they are suffering for my sins and I am therefore presuppose their punishment. I observe them these men brought up to a life other than my own in all there is an air of shepherds asleep armed with knives For surely the first of their passion is their desire for well Sordid as their unwashed limbs hidden yet exposed to pry without modesty as without modesty some fluttering bird of prey pre-taste their bite or may be look for spider They long for money like gypsies, mercenaries, whores they complain that they don't have it using gross flattery to get it bursting like porters if their pockets are full of it mafiosi, butchers It's so hard to say in a son's words what I'm so little like in my heart. Only you in all the world know what my heart always held before any other love. So, I must tell you something terrible to know from within your kindness my anguish grew You're irreplaceable and because you are the life you gave me is condemned to loneliness. And I don't want to be alone I have an infinite hunger for love, loving bodies without souls. But the soul is inside you, it is you, but you're my mother and your love is my slavery. My childhood I lived slaved with this lofty, incurable sense of an immense obbligation. It was the only way to feel life, unique form, sole color and now it's over. We survive in the confusion of a life reborn outside reason. I pray you, oh, I pray you: don't die! I'm here, alone, with you, in a future April... Speak to me. Sun, moon speak to me Why can't I either longer hear the sound of your voice Speak to me Sand, grass, stone speak to me In public also the world that was unknown to me has come closer, familiar and made itself known and, little by little, has imposed itself upon me, a brutal necessity. I like a youth without powerty or modesty I don't hide this state of mind I'll never have peace, never - What's matter? - Nothing. It doesn't matter - What's your name? - What's to you. What you need to know my name for? - I'm only asking My name is Paul. - Don't need to tell me. I already know Everybody knows your name - Where are you taking me - Where do you want to go? Do you want to eat? I can.. - It's up to you You want to eat...ain't you? - Yeah, if you like it Are you going to join me or are you get to stand there all night? It's a big fight Fight? It's just young men paid by old men to beat each other into submission That's far different from what you do then? I've never paid my friends to beat each other So... This is where you bring your young friends, is it? if they do it well No one stays young forever You're hungry? - Yeah Have you eaten today? If I hadn't, does it matter? It does matter. It's not me, in any case I'm speaking to your stomach Lot pieces of my body you're thinking about Order what you want Excuse-me a moment The feel of soundtrack were missing, cars and trucks pass under the arches among the asphalt, pass the gasometer in the hour, the golden hour of Hiroshima, twenty years on, sunk even further in their beckoning death And I? A hind end with death, too early for real-life, drinking the fearful presence of the light like a sparkling wine Nation without hope! The apocalypse exploding without anyone noticing, in the melancholy of mannerist Italy, has killed everyone I like it here, you know? Many performs happened in here - With you as director... Every time... you could say this is my court. To be thin on the glamour with your budget limited I don't need lot of props or sets I got in faces - Faces... - Yeah, faces You know, eyes, lips, arms... Sometimes added togheter they can be more than words or pictures What of this face means to you then? This face...this face is a face...pinch It means distrust A face that thinks is very smart the face of a boy who rolls old men in dark cinemas who mugged the young whore when she returned at home late at night, after work, alone A face that would like to be respectable if he could get married a face that is totally angry. All that in one face Well you asked it, so I described it for you You make it sound it some beautiful or that ugly Is that why you chose me? Because I'm cool, it's that beutiful? Maybe... Beautiful, cool, hard, ugly.. You are like any other fucking old queen Oh the heartbreaker, the angry young man got it in one and what will you do with all your youth and anger? Survive? Uhmmm... Are you a survivor or just coming up for air for one last time before you drown? You're not supposed to smoke. Put it out Stupendous and miserable city, you taught me what joyful, ferocious men have known as kids little things in which the greatness of life is discovered in peace how to be tough and ready in the confusion of the streets adressing another man without trembling, not ashamed to watch money counted, lazy fingers but sweaty delivery boys against facades flashing by in the eternal colour of summer; to defend myself, to offend to have a world for my eyes and not just in my heart to understand that few know the passions which I've lived through they're not brothers to me and yet they are true brothers in passions of men who, light-hearted and unconscioued live entire experiences unknown to me Stupendous and miserable city which made me experience that unknown life until I discovered what, in each of us, is the world The refined one and the lumpen-proletarian the same hierarchical rule feeling both outside history in a world with no way out except for sex and heart with no profondity except in senses where joy is joy, pain pain I like cat I remember mine Rushed attracted by stars and adored these terrific tree but still the least hated its nine lives like a snake reduced to a bloody pulp in half You... me with this death a kind of alchemy must now transform the doubts and reputation that have always accompanied his works seen by many as calculated and insincere dictated only by contingent motives ...... must now be eliminated by a mythical sincerity the redemption that such a death can accomplish The circumstances of which come within the context he was trying to define a victim of one of his own characters a tragedy which he himself had foreseen not knowing that one day it would end up by overcoming him Here over time we've created by the brutal forces entrenched images a light of live tragedy courtroom walls fields of execution and the far-off pantomime of circle where peripheries have grown bleached white in naked white The shops are there, our survival
