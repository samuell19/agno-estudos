US Marshall Service. Patch me to the Marshall, Hugh Tanley. What's this regarding? Tell him it's Billy Burke. Billy? Tanley. What's going on? I wanna move. Move, move where? Anywhere. Have you talked to her? You can't just take the kids and disappear, Bill. What not? 'Cause you can't. I wanna start over. You did it before, you can do it again. It doesn't work like that. Then explain exactly how it's suppose to fucking work 'cause as far as I can tell all you people do is yank a guy out of his life and toss him in the fucking barrel. Calm down. Don't tell me to fucking calm down. Where would you be if you back in Boston, huh? The river, the ground, or stuffed in snowbank with your teeth knocked out and a slug in your temple? We saved you, Bill. Just keep your head down and live your life. You're not Billy Burke any more. You gonna pay for that? Just dock it. Dock it from what? You're two hours late. I had to stay after school. Fuck. Hey. The school has obligation to look into any accusations of this nature. What exactly is he being accused of? I'm sure you're aware of the incident that occurred last week? What does that have to do with Darren? Several students came forward and said that he was the one responsible for providing the narcotics. That's ridiculous. - Miss Greenwood... - Darren's a straight A student. Miss Greenwood, I understand... And who the hell are these students you're talking about? I can't give you that infor... What makes their word better than my sons? Maybe you ought to look into them, instead of the kids they're trying to dump all the blame on. I don't believe that's the situation here, Miss Greenwood. Based on what? Based on Darren's behavior. He's been absent 22 days in the last 40 days of school. His grades are plummeting, he flunking three subjects, he's hanging around with a different group of kids. Why hasn't anyone contacted me about this? We did, I have a, I have a signed progress report from two weeks ago from both of you. Who do you think you are? I scribbled a name on a piece of paper, Carol. Why? To avoid this. Avoid what? You losing your fucking mind over nothing at all. He's a kid, kid's fuck up. He doesn't need to hear from you when you're like this. Did you even hear what was said in there? Two kids died, Mitch. They were on pills for Christ sake. They was friends. And now they're dead. Darren will be next if we don't do something. Do what, Carol? What the fuck do you wanna do? You wanna ignore this whole thing, act like it didn't happen? That's right. You're pathetic. Two of his friends just died, whether he sold them the pills or not. You think now is the time to talk about this? If he was your son, we wouldn't be having this conversation. When you're finished with that, start stocking the shelves. I got to go pick up your brother. What can I get ya? Pack of reds. Billy. Yeah, on the the corner. Be right there. You got your mother in a panic, you know? I should charge you gas money for all the driving around I just did looking for ya. What are we doin' here, Darren? Waiting for a train. Where you goin'? Nowhere. Then what are we waitin' for? How long you been here? Since the store closed. I don't know, but I think a couple of trains have come by since then. Don't be a dick. I'm just saying. I tried all right? Throwing yourself in front of a train ain't something you try and fail at. You either do it or you don't. I'm gonna do it. All right. You can't stop me. Fine. Wanna talk about it? It ain't your fault, you know that right? Those kids were gonna do whatever they were gonna do whether you helped them or not. It happens. No it doesn't. Well it did. A lot of people done plenty worse. Yeah, like who? It'll go away, you just got to get it out of your head. You think it's that easy? What's the worse thing you've ever done to somebody? If it was anything like this, you'd know this isn't going away. Come on, let's get outta here. You gettin' hungry? Nah, I'm good. Got a coupon for a pizza in here. I was thinking 'bout grabbing one. If you get it, I'll eat it, but not really that hungry. What did you get your mother for Christmas? Nothing yet. Better get on that. I don't know what to get her. Well, you better get her something, she's you're mother for Christ's sake. What did you get her? Nothing yet. So what are you giving me a hard time for? I'm just her husband, you're her suppose to be on top of that kind of stuff. Well, I don't know what she wants. Got any ideas? I was kinda hoping you had something. Well, maybe we'll get her a gift together, but it's got to be a good one or she think we got lazy and screwed her out of her present. Isn't that what's happening? Not if it's a good one. How 'bout we get her a gift card? No, we can't get her a gift card. If we get her a gift card, we might as well get her cash. Get her cash, we might as well get her nothing at all. How 'bout one of those elliptical machines she's been talking about? No, she'll make me use it. You know what? We can get her one of those, one of those vacuums that cleans the floor by itself. Those exist? Yeah, they got 'em at the department store down the road. What time they open til? Bout another half hour. It's a good idea, why don't you run up there and grab one. And when you're done, swing by and pick me up. You sure? Mom hasn't been letting me drive the past couple weeks. No, I trust you. Just pick me up when you're done. Thanks dad. What can I get for you? Newports. Anything else? Ten thousand. Ten? On average. But that varies depending on the particulars. What particulars you talking about? Well, the casket, for instance. An average casket, it'll set you back about two and half grand, but that price fluctuates depending on the quality of the specific casket that you chose. How much for that one? That one's around four or 5,000. I only got two. For the casket? For everything. Have you thought about cremation? No, no. Well, if you'd like I could... I'm not burning my mother. She's gettin' buried. I understand where you're coming from, but cremation... It's not an option. She wants to be buried, not burned. That'll be impossible with only 2,000. Look, I can give you a couple of days to figure something out, maybe ask a relative if they mind pitching in, but these are the prices you're gonna find everywhere. I'm sorry. Hey, Nicole. Derek. What are you doing here? I'm sorry, I didn't wanna just show up, but you were suppose to call after your appoint. What's up? Hi. What's all that? I, I got it for you because of the doctor. Could we talk in the other room for a minute? You can't just show up without calling, Derek. I've been calling all day. Well, my phone's been dead. Well, how am I suppose to know that? You gonna tell me what's going on? I have no idea what's going on. That's why I'm here. I mean how did it go? How did what go? You know the, the test. What, what's wrong? Nothing, it... I'm fine. Fine, what's that mean, what's fine? I mean, I mean they didn't find anything. That's, that's great. So? So? So, they didn't find anything, where's that leave us? What do you mean? I mean, are we getting back together or? You said you only wanted to break up because you might have cancer. You said you didn't want me to be the guy with a sick girlfriend and you needed some time. I know what I said. So, are we back together? I don't, I don't get it. Um, you said you only wanted to break up because of the cancer. It ain't gonna get any easier. Eddie. You look like shit. Gee, thanks. I'm just saying. Yeah, well, you're no fucking prize either pal. Where the hell you get a dog? She's my mother's. How's that goin' with your mother? That's why I called. Yeah, I figured. So you got something or what? Yeah, I got something. Any good? Could be. A shot in the dark, though. Oh. Well, if we get done, it's 15 a pop, but I ain't sure I like what it is. 15 a piece? Is it coming from Lou? I think so, but I didn't talk to him. I talked to a Jackknife. Oh, well let me know. You ever heard of Billy Burke? He used to run around with Bobby Green. Pulled a couple of scores back in the day. Billy Burke used to own that store on Seymour Street when we were kids, right? That's the one. I remember him, what ever happened to him? Fucking rat. About eight years ago they found his brother stuffed in a snowbank down on the waterfront. Billy flipped with the feds and vanished not long after. What are you saying? Got a couple of friends of ours put away for a while. You been a, been watching the news last couple weeks? A little bit. You hear about that body they found up in New Hampshire? A couple of weeks ago some old bombs got dropped outside a Sheriff's station, a middle east bonfire. Yeah? Yeah. So what? So they ID-ed the body day before yesterday. Gordon Belkin. Gordon Belkin? How? Someone dug him up. What the purpose somebody dig him up? I don't know, but Jackknife says only two people knew where Belkin's body was buried. Bobby was one of them, everybody knows that. Yeah, but Bobby's got another year left at Walpole, so they don't know it wasn't him. Who's the other person? Billy Burke. Burke's in New Hampshire? Right in the middle of East Bumfuck. And you wanna go get him? 15 a pop. You're a retarded motherfucker, ain't ya? I hope not. I'm just out here and listen to you ramble for five minutes and that's all you came to tell me, man? Yeah. I need eight grand by the end of this week, Derek. So what the fuck are we doing standing around and talking about it? Let's go get him. He's a wuss sack, you fucking dumb ass. He's got a new name, he's got a new life. We don't even know if he's inside the town or inside the state. There's only one way to find out. What the fuck you waste my time with this for, man? I got to get out of here, man. A weekend away sound good and 15K sounds better. I need a sure thing. Well you don't have one. What else you got? Ma? What are you doing here? Ma. That sounds like Lake Ossipee? Think it did. I went to camp up there one summer. Lake Ossipee. They used to have this program where they'd round up all the kids running around the projects and ship 'em up north for two weeks. I thought I remember you being there. The older kids were fucking pricks. I remember they used to, they used to take these tube socks and fill 'em up with baby powder and whip us with 'em. Felt like getting hit with a fucking rock. Got these white marks all over you clothes. I remember this one night, I was sittin' in the cabin with some older kids. I don't know what I was doin' in there, 'cause I wasn't hangin' out with any of them, but any way, I'm sittin' in there and I hear 'em all talking and they're talking about how they're gonna wail til we all fall asleep that night and then they're gonna run in and beat the shit out of us with those powder socks. So I hear that and I think not me, right? But I don't know what to do because there are six of them and there's one of me and I don't want to get my ass kicked, so what I ended up doing was, I stood up and I walked right through the their little powwow. You know, just get their attention, right? Then I go over into the corner of the room and I grab this, there was a wooden broom stick there. I kicked it and snapped it right in half. Look at the sharp end for a second. Then I go over to the other side of the room and I got a, there was a metal folding chair laying there, so I grabbed the piece of the metal and I twisted and twisted and snapped it off. It was a little metal pipe, I tucked in my sleeve. So then I go back over and I sit down with them. I got the broken broomstick in one hand, the metal pipe up my sleeve. I look 'em all square in the face and I say, if any of you come near me tonight I'll stab you in the fucking chest. They didn't bother me after that. You sure you weren't up there with us? No. Probably would of liked it. I remember my a, had my first girlfriend up there. Leah Donahue. She's from Dorchester. We used to go tubing out on the lake. What's wrong with you? What you mean? I mean you been staring out the window for the last half hour. Aren't that windows are for? Really? You gonna be like that? You don't wanna talk that's fine. It's just a long fucking drive for me to be sittin' here talking to myself the whole way. Do you ever think about eternity? What? You know like, what happens after you die. What are you talkin' about? I just told you. Yeah, but. Wonder if this is it? No heaven, no hell. Just this. And nothing and then we're sad. There's nothing. I been trying to wrap my head around this. Was just suffocating. Just shut the fuck up and stare out your window. Derek. Where'd you put it? Threw it out. Where? Well, it ain't in that dumpster. You ain't gonna find it in there. Get a hold of yourself. There was $300 worth of booze in the cooler. Oh yeah? Look like the good stuff. You think this is funny? No, I don't. You owe me $300. Oh yeah? Yeah. Well, you owe me two hours it took me to find your drunk ass passed out on the fucking dock. And then you owe me another half hour it took me to drag your drunk ass back to this fucking frozen car that you left me in. And then it took me two hours to walk to the nearest fucking gas station and it took me two hours to walk back. Are we done? Yeah, I get the gist. We're almost in. Can't stay here. Why not? Fucking GI Joe in there says no dogs allowed. I already checked three other motels and they all said the same shit. You serious? Let's think of something later. Can't afford to waste no more time up here. Where you going? I'm gonna talk to him. Told you he was an asshole. There's a Bed and Breakfast up the road. It's the only place in town that allows dogs. Where'd you hear that? The guy just told me. The guy in there? Yeah, who else? Well how'd you get him to tell you that? I asked him. You don't think I asked him? Yeah, well you tend to be a little fucking abrasive sometimes. You should try listening to people. See how it suits ya. What's the breakfast look like? Here is dog. Maybe God sent that. No, I'm all right. All right. Tell me if you want anything else. So what's next? Huh? What are we doin'? Where we goin', how we finding Billy Burke? None of that, settle down, you're giving me a headache. Derek, I didn't come here to no fucking cereal in the bum's backyard. What's the plan? We're gonna make a plan. That's what we're doin', we're brainstorming. Brainstorming? - Yeah, brainstorming. - Brainstorming? I'm gonna drown this hangover. We're gonna eat our breakfast and we're gonna come up with a plan. Right now, together. So shut up and eat your cereal. It's soggy. Well that's no good. All right, so we're up here. Now what? We find Burke. Good. How? Well we start by leaving this shit hole and start looking for him. All right, you wanna wing it, we'll wing it. I figured you'd wanna make a plan since you're the one sitting here bitching about breakfast and everything. You thought I want some god damn cold cereal, Derek? I mean fucking I didn't think it was that bad. Quit wasting time, let's go. Do you remember what he looks like? I think I'd know him if I seen him. And I won't. I'm gonna poke around a bit. All right. Excuse me, can I get a beer, please? Thank you. How much? Mind if I sit? I'm not gonna be here long. Yeah, me ah, me either. I'm only in town for a day or two. Hmm, that's so? Mm-hmm. What brings you into town? Just checking out the spots. I like this one. In this spot? What's to like? I don't know. Something about it. Basically, there's just a bunch of bars around here. There's a bowling alley down the road, but that's about it. Bowling alley, which way do I head? Like down that way. That way. Take a left, you can't miss it. I'll ah, I'll have to check it out. Derek. He ain't here. It was nice talking to you, uh? Shannon. Nice talking to you, Shannon. I didn't order anything. We should head back to that bar. No sense in waste those clothes. I'll drive if you want. Why you ask me to come up here, man? Huh? You heard what I said. You need the money, I'm looking out for you. You ain't looking out for me. If you came up here to find Burke, you wouldn't have spent the last 36 hours fucking around. I only got two more to find the money. I told you from the beginning. I said it's a long shot. You knew I had no choice. Tell you what, I'm only here for one more day, then I'm going back home. How you gonna find the money if you're back in Boston? It doesn't matter. At least I won't be here wasting my time. All right. Here's what's gonna happen. I'm going out tonight and when I come back, I'm gonna have a plan. Once I have that plan, we're gonna make you that money. All right? Trust me, I got this. Jesus. That's a lot of chicken. Yeah well, I figure if I don't eat 'em, then they died for nothing, right? Yeah, maybe. You want some? No, sir, man. You sure? I ain't gonna eat 'em, so might as well. No, really, thank you, man. You wanna a beer? Eh, no, I really shouldn't. You shouldn't, why not? Heh, my fiance got me on this diet. It's torture, man. I've been eating salad and smoothie for the past month and a half. Just here for the game. What kind of diet? One of those low-calorie diets? Low-calorie, low-carb, no fun. All right, I got you, man. Hey, can I get some vodka down here? Low-calorie. So then I look them all square in the face and I say, if any of you come near me tonight, I'll stab you in the fucking chest. And they believed you? Yeah, I meant it. Can't let 'em walk all over you like that. Sometimes you got to break a broomstick and act like a fucking nut case. All right, tough guy. Last call, gentlemen. All right, I'm gonna head to the bathroom. I'll alert the media. What's that? This? It's beer. Where's mine? Yours? Gotta order one. I got to order one? Yeah. That's how it works, isn't it? You order a beer, they give you one. That's funny 'cause the, the last four times I ordered a shot, they gave me two. Pretty sure they charged me for each of them as well. Every time I ordered two shots and paid for two shots, I slid on of them in your direction. Yeah. Thanks. No problem, what I'm gettin' at is I bought you four shots just now. I heard what you said. Good, then you see how this seems a little fucking rude. I don't know what you're talking about. You think this is right? I duck out for two seconds, I come back and you bought yourself a drink and didn't get me one. I didn't ask you to buy me four drinks, bro. You didn't have to ask, bro. That's what I'm talking about. Do you want a drink? I'll buy you a drink. Don't talk to me like I'm begging you for something. It's common fucking courtesy. All right, all right, sweetheart. You want a drink, I'll buy you a drink. So now you're gonna be a fucking smart ass about it? I'm just buying you a drink. Isn't that what you wanted? You know what? I don't want your fucking drink. Then what are you crying about? This one's on me. Drink it. Thanks. Don't thank me. It's common fucking courtesy. Fucking cheap ass, Derek. Got me all the way out here in these fucking woods cleaning up all this fucking beer this motherfucker done drunk. Fuck. Hush. Oh, shit. Derek. Sadie. Sadie. Sorry. For what? I don't know. Well you gonna come and sit down or are you just gonna stand there? You're pretty good at that. I know. So you always go around pulling guns on people? I wasn't gonna hurt him, I was just gonna scare him. He was being a prick. Yeah, well he's always been a prick. We went to school together when we were kids. Oh yeah? Yeah, his family owns the only decent asian restaurant in 60 miles though. It's one of the ones that they cook food in front of you. It's a hibachi place? Yeah, whatever it is, it's good. I don't go there though. His whole family is ass holes. Yeah, I believe it. This is little Shannon? Mm-hmm. That your dad with you? This is his place? It was. Oh, sorry. He's not dead, he's just sick. Dementia, he's at an assisted living place down the road. Dementia, that's like uh, that's like Alzheimers, right? They're basically the same thing, but you can't be diagnosed with Alzheimer until after you're dead, so until, they say you have dementia. Sorry to hear that. It's okay. So this is your place? Mm-hmm. I have the mortgage bills to prove it. That sucks. Yeah, it does. Cops get a decent pension though, right? That's got to help. That doesn't even cover his assisted living. No? What do you do to pay for it all? I'm a Dental Hygienist. No you're not. Yeah I am. I knew there had to be something wrong with you. You have a problem with dental hygienists? It's not the, it's the whole teeth thing, showing my teeth kinda freaks me out. Oh my God, you're one of those people. What's that suppose to mean? Nothing, I just think you're a bit of a wimp. I'm not a wimp, but I just don't like when people mess around with my teeth. What about the dentist? You don't go to the dentist? Never. That's horrible, you should be ashamed of yourself. I brush my teeth everyday, I'm not filthy. I just like to do it on my own. Open your mouth. Why? Just do it. What are you gonna do to me? Nothin'. I don't trust you. Come on, quit being a pussy and open your mouth. Looks fine. That's it, I'm good to go? Mm-hmm. That's the dental hygienist stamp of approval? That's why they pay me the big bucks. I'm gonna go get some coke. Do you want some? Ah, I'm good with this for now. Thanks. This ah, is this Old Orchard Beach? Uh, probably. I used to love this place when I was a kid. They use to have this big carnival up at the 4th of July. Oh yeah, we used to go there for that. Really? Mm-hmm. Oh shit. What? Nothing, I just, I thought you meant, you know. You thought I meant like coke, coke. Uh, yeah. It's funny how that doesn't happen more often. Yeah, I guess. Well, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to freak you out or anything. No, that's fine. I just wasn't expecting it, that's all. So you don't mind if I? No, that's cool, I really, it doesn't matter, I just, it caught me a little off guard. Well, okay then. Do you ever do blow? Ah, I used to a bit, but my ex wasn't big into that kind of stuff, so I kind of gave it up for her. You always do what people tell you? What was your name again? Eddie. That's a good name. I'm Pat. You like my name? Yeah, I mean sure, I guess so. Eh, I never liked it, too, too plain. Now my brother had a better name. Here. Nah, I'm all right, man. You do this often? Most nights. Why? I like it. I like space. You like space? I guess so. You know I really don't know much about it though. Nobody knows much about anything. What's that one right there? That's the North Star, isn't it? Good. It's Polaris. Polaris? Yeah, for now, it's the North Star. But the purpose of the North Star is that it's always the same star. It's always in the same place, right? Sailors use it like a, like a compass, right? That sort of thing. It's been the same for 5,000 years, but before that it was a different one. And another one before that and another one before that. 13,000 years from now, it'll change again and again and again and again. How far does that go on? Forever. My brother liked space. That's how you got into it, huh? How, how did your brother die? If you don't mind me asking. He died in a fire. You remember what you did? What do you mean? I mean like how, I mean how'd you get over it? You don't get over things like that. Batman, peanut butter? Nine eleven. Nine eleven? Okay, shut up, you're not allowed to talk. All right. Stevie Nicks? Rain dance? Seizure? I don't wanna do this any more. Oh come on. You just, you're not even trying. You're making me stand up here and I look like an idiot. This ain't, this ain't fun for me. What? It's embarrassing. You were doing so good though. Don't patronize me, you're making it worse. Fine. Patronize sound like patron eyes, like the eyes of a patron. No one ever talks about that. Probably because it's not interesting. What word did you have any ways? I don't wanna tell you. Squid? Leave me alone. Have you ever even seen a squid? Leave me alone. I think I'm gonna head up to bed soon. Yeah. Mm-hmm, you can crash on the couch though, if you want. The couch? After what you just put me through? That's right. It's a comfy couch though. It is a comfy couch. What time is it any way? Aw, shit. What's wrong? Ah, nothing, it just I told my friend I'd come back with a plan. Plan for what? He needs money. I told him that I might be able to get him some, but doesn't look like that's gonna happen. That sucks. Yeah. He'll probably fucking disown me after this. Well too bad you can't call your buddy from the bar. Who? Peter Cheung, the Asian guy. What about him? Well, he's rich. I don't know if he is rich, but his family's rich. I thought you said his family owned a hibachi place. Yeah, like five other businesses. They have more money that they know what to do with. You wanna rob a hibachi place? Just shut up and hear me out, all right? The guy who owns this place is a local fucking monopoly. He's got six businesses and he stashes all the cash in his office at the restaurant. And how do you know this? A friend of mine used to work at his a, at his flower shop when she was in high school. What friend? Nevermind, what friend. Look, she said that when she worked in the flower shop, she used to make daily runs to the hibachi place 'cause the guy keeps the cash from all six businesses stashed in the, in a safe in the back office there. You wanna tell me what the fuck that is over there? That's the get away car. The get away car? Yeah, the get away car. You wanna tell me where the fuck is the car we're suppose to drive home in? It's at my friend's place. - What friend? - Nevermind what friend. You and that shit. What does that have to do with anything? Look, I got this thing at the junk yard. It was 500 bucks plus 200 to fix the engine, but we'll talk about that after we hit the restaurant. If we hurry, we can go now while they're getting ready to open. What about Billy Burke? Fuck Billy Burke, it's like you said, we're never gonna find that guy. I mean you need, you need the money, right? You need the money, you said I come back with a plan, this is what I got for you. What do you say? Hands up. - I don't know, I don't know, - Open the fucking safe. - The code man. - What do you mean you don't know the fucking code? - Its my dads. - That's a fucking lie. Fuck you're fucking dad. Put the fucking money in the bag. - I don't know the code, man. - Put the fucking money in the bag! What's going on out here? Oh shit. Shit, shit. I knew that fucking, I knew that... Eddie, you okay? Don't say my fucking name, dumb ass. I leave you just two fucking seconds this is what happens. She's got a fucking shotgun, Derek. Yeah, I noticed. Eddie: You see that bitch is got to a gun. What do you think I gave her. Fucking pistol? She's got guns, how is this my fault? All right, let's go, let's go. Let's do it on three, ready? Three. That wasn't three. I didn't get the safe. Fucking, the kid didn't know the code and then all the shooting started, so I didn't have time to figure it out. What'd you get from the register? A couple hundred. It's all coming together white car. You think it's a fucking joke, don't you? Just trying to lighten the mood. You trying to lighten the fucking mood. That's what you were trying to do this whole time, trying to lighten the fucking mood, huh, huh? It was a joke all right, I'm sorry. You ain't sorry, so don't fucking at like it, Derek. Oh so, now you what I'm thinking? You ain't sorry, Derek. You fucked up is what you are. You've been drunk since before we left Boston, and now you fucking snort coke in a fucking catering truck. Is there a point you're trying to get at or are we just talking shit now? My point is you got to a fucking problem and it's starting to affect... That's my fucking point. Oh, I got a problem? Yes, you got a fucking problem. And what about you, huh? What's your excuse? I'm fucked up, okay. And what about you? 'Cause as far as I can remember I haven't forced you to do shit. You chose to come up with me and you chose to come with me this morning, so don't fucking try to pin it all on me when it's... there's something in your head making you make those choices. Holy shit. What the fuck was that? How far is the car? About five miles that way. Where you going? Where you going? I need a minute. For what? I'm gonna pick up the car. Call me when you're ready. You all right? Well look who it is. There you are. I was wondering where you took off to. I went to see my father. Yeah? How is he? Hi. Hey. You all right? What do you mean? I mean you almost did a face plant just then. Ah, it's just these stupid boots, they're real hard to balance in. I smoked a bag of fuel on my way home. Oh, all right. Where you headed? Uh, I was thinking about heading home. Home? Yeah, my friend's been having gone with a rough time and well I'm up here on a bit of a wild goose chase, so I figure I should probably get him back. Look, I'd rather stay here and hang out with you, I just, I got to run, head into town and pick up a few things before we hit the road, so I'm sorry. It's, it's, it's all good. I understand. You wanna a, you wanna come with me? Come where? Into town. You want me to come? Ah, yeah if you want. I just got to run by the place we've been staying and pick up the dog. I won't be able to give you a ride back. Not cause I'm lazy or I don't want to, I just, I don't know what time, you know, my friend's gonna call me and I'm gonna have to go pick him up and I don't wanna say I'm gonna give you a ride now and not be able to do it. It's a, you know, I was actually gonna go into town anyway, so it works out. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Ah, shit. What's wrong? It's just you're not suppose to keep this out of the cold for too long. Do you mind if I throw it in your freezer when we get there? Ah, sure, what is it? I already told you, it's PCP. When the hell did you tell me that? I told you I smoked a bag of fuel on my way home. That's what fuel is? Yeah, what did you think it was? I don't know, I thought you meant weed or something, I didn't think fuel was PCP. I didn't even know that shit was still around. Yeah, it isn't. You've got to drive all the way down in New York City and go into to Harlan to pick it up. I know a guy who makes a trip every couple weeks. So, um, do you mind if I throw it in your freezer when we get there? Ah. Nah, go for it, I guess. And it's not, god, it's not like that. You're totally tripping out over nothing. Like we can talk being out tomorrow. It's my dad. I know, I know it wasn't cool, I know. No, I'm not high. Ah, shut up. Dude, you're like, just... I can't talk right now. I can't do this shit right now. I got too much on my, on my plate, dude. You got to go, I got to go. Yeah, fuck off. You hear from your friend? Nah, not yet. Something wrong? Nah, it's just this guy. We used to date. Kinda, but... We're suppose to meet up and smoke the rest of this bag later, but. You don't wanna? I don't know. He can just be real creepy sometimes and I don't know if I wanna hang out with him when I'm all fucked up. Then don't go. Well, I mean I don't know, it might not be that bad. I don't wanna smoke it all by myself. You wanna, you wanna smoke it here? Really, you don't mind? No, it's cool. Okay. Thank you, man, you're a real lifesaver. This guy's a real weirdo. Last time I hung out with him, he spotted me some money for gas and that just means that the next time I see him, he's gonna try to swing that in some weird favor, you know. You know like we didn't even do anything crazy ever. He just, he's always trying something. We only dated for like a minute and... I don't know. It's just real annoying to be around. Thank you. Hey, be careful. Oh shit, sorry. Now what were we talking about? Oh, yeah, that, that douche bag, yeah, he's a weirdo. You ever been on a duck boat tour? Ah, nah, I've seen 'em around though. Yeah, one time my dad brought me up, out to Boston on one of those duck boat tours and I really wanted to see the ducks and ah, I didn't know there was some floating car tour, so ah, you can imagine I was pretty pis... Shannon, watch out. Relax, man, she's fine. I mean people always feel like they got to say something or they got to do something, do something, we're like no. Ah, do something when people say things or a, they don't, people don't think to think to think about themselves. Hey, come on, you're gonna hurt Sadie. You can't sit there. Can't sit where? In the chair. What chair? The one you were just sitting in. It's yours? Let's go for a walk somewhere. You can't tell me what to do. What? What are you a dictator or something? What are you, what are you saying? Derek, Derek, Derek, Der. I'm stuck. I'm stuck. Are you fucking with me? Shannon. I don't wanna be stuck. Am I gonna be stuck? This looks horrible. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Ah, aah, what the fuck? Okay, Sh, Shannon, I'm gonna, I'm gonna unstick you. Okay, on three. One, two, three. Fuck. Shannon, Shannon, Sha, Sha, Shannon. Fuck. Come on, Shannon, Shannon. Shannon. Yo. Slow down, what happened? You can still catch the end of it. No, I just wanna sit here a bit longer. I've been thinking about what you said the other day. About what? About eternity. I don't know why the fuck you listen to me for. I don't what the fuck I'm talking about. No, man, what if she's right? What if this is all there is? And there's just nothing. I guess that mean every second you spent with her means that much more, right? You know, the North Star wasn't always the North Star? What the fuck are you talking about? North Star, it changes every couple thousand years. Before we had this one, there was another one, and before that one, there was another one. In a couple thousand years, there'll be another one. It's gonna keep going like that forever. Both directions. What does that have to do with anything? So you can talk about this shit, you got to realize that the amount of time we got is so fucking small, it's microscopic, it's smaller than that, it's... We're talking about infinity, man. So what are you saying, that a, we're so fucking small and insignificant that none of this really matters? - That's not what I'm saying. - That's what it - sounds like. - That's not what the fuck - I said, I'm not saying that. - And it ain't fucking helping - me out right now. - Well, I'm not saying that. It just not what I'm saying. I'm saying that we're only here for a moment and every part of that moment is specific to a certain place and a certain time. It's not that we don't matter, it's the opposite, it's every second of our life no matter how small, no matter how painful, every second is special. Every second is one in infinity. Got any ideas? I was kinda hoping you had something. Well, maybe we'll get her a gift together, but it's got to be a good one or she'll think we got lazy and screwed her out of her present. Isn't that what's happening? Not if it's a good one. How 'bout we get her a gift card? No, we can't get her a gift card. We get her a gift card, we might as well get her cash, you get her cash you might as well get her nothing at all. How 'bout one of those elliptical machines she's been talking about? No, she'll make me use it. You know what? We can get her one of those, one of those vacuums that cleans the floor by itself. Those exist? Yeah, they got 'em at the department store down the road. What time they open til? About another half hour. That a good idea. Why don't you run up there and grab one. And when you're done, swing by and pick me up. You sure? Mom hasn't been letting me drive the couple weeks. No, I trust you. Just pick me up when you're done. Thanks dad. What can I get for you? Newports. Any thing else?
