[intro music] [music playing] [WOMAN ON LOUDSPEAKER SPEAKING SPANISH] NARRATOR: This is story of one family who for 18 years have suffered the life of mind control, and physical and sexual abuse. Sylvia Padilla and her children have made the long journey from London for a reunion at a town in northern Mexico. Waiting for them is her oldest daughter, Debbie, and her two sons. [music playing] [speaking excitedly in spanish] NARRATOR: The reunion is a milestone for an English family slowly picking up the pieces of a normal life after living the last two decades inside a controversial religious cult. [video playback] [SINGING] Who will take a stand, and heed the call from heaven above? Who will join the band of those who are the army of God? Called to live and die for the Kingdom, as we give our own to the Lord. This is where it all began, 22 years ago. I came out to a prominent station, I turned left, and where this is all desolate now, there was a big factory. And there was a big notice that said, Children of God. And this meeting with the Children of God sealed my destiny for the next 18 yeas. [SINGING] --give our lives for the Kingdom. NARRATOR: Children of God were a hot, radical, and American evangelical group, whose army of young people went to capture the world for Jesus. Their leader was David Berg, an unconventional preacher who founded the group on the beaches of California in the late 1960s. [youngsters singing] Sylvia Gordon was then a 22 year-old with an urge to travel the world. She ended up in Costa Rica, where she met Arnoldo Padilla. In 1964 they married, and had two children before returning to England. When we met the Children of God, we felt this was exactly what we were looking for, something with the fire and dynamism that we wanted. So we joined them. They gave us intensive training. And they gave us a mission, my mission was to go to Costa Rica and to capture it for Jesus. [music playing] We just left everything behind, and threw everything into it-- all our worldly possessions, picked up a little-- little camper, and we traveled down, all the way through the States to Mexico. The traveling was exciting, but every time we stopped by one of the colonies, I would feel tremendous pressure. They were very pushy and very bossy. And I couldn't understand why they weren't particularly nice to us. And I thought at the time, it was because they're pushy Americans, [laughs] and they were very young, they were sort of ex-hippies. And I thought, well, they're quite young in their Christian life. They haven't learned love and tolerance yet. And I put up with a lot of rather unpleasant behavior, actually. But when we were on our own, we found it quite exciting. [music playing] NARRATOR: Finally, Sylvia and her husband arrived back in Costa Rica with their two daughters, Shuly, then aged seven, and Debbie, who was three. [music playing] [sylvia speaking spanish] That's the house. That's the house where you were born from. That's the house I brought the Children of God to. Where all stuff that-- You see how small it is. We had up to 30 Children of God members actually living there. Not visiting, but actually living there at the time. DEBBIE: 30? SYLVIA: 30. But this part of the house actually belonged to your grandfather, he'd let us use. And when he came to visit, he had no idea there was so many people coming. DEBBIE: Really? And we hid people in the cupboards, so it looked like jus we were living there. I had a leader who was only 19 years old. And because this was my house before I joined, I automatically went into the kitchen to do something, and I got-- sorry, up and down. And I was told I must never go in the kitchen without knocking, that it wasn't my house anymore. It was really-- it was a crazy situation. And believe it or not-- Bizarre. It was bizarre. It was bizarre. You know what it seems to me like, it looks exactly the same. It seems like the whole-- all that time was like a dream. [youngsters singing loudly] VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: [inaudible] really stuck on a tune, and she's quite an evangelist. And she really has the fire, and she really can get them stirred up and praising the Lord. [youngsters singing loudly] Whilte full of kids, they couldn't believe how many children we had when we showed up with a couple of busloads, and more than half of it were children. [youngsters singing loudly] SYLVIA: I thought I was getting the children into actually the best Christian group. And that was the existence in the world. And so I thought, even if it was tough, we'll surely get blessed by it. [youngsters singing loudly] VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: And that was one of the biggest accomplishments of the entire meeting, that everybody together decided to follow Jesus. [youngsters singing loudly] SYLVIA: At that time, I was complete obedient to the leadership. I had to go to these meetings, it was very, very strict. And if you queried anything, you were soundly rebuked, so that fear was put into you. It was very, very unpleasant. NARRATOR: The strict control came from the very top, David Berg laid down precise rules, nothing was done without his permission. Yet he was an elusive figure. The most his followers saw of him were cartoon drawings in cult literature. He never preached in public, and never allowed photographs. His whereabouts were a closely guarded secret. Welcome to Mexico. We're Solomon and Katrina. And we're presently working here as [non-english]. We want to welcome you to our second, yes. NARRATOR: Cult members communicated with their leader by video. VIDEO PLAYABCK [FEMALE VOICE]: God bless you. We're so thankful to have this opportunity, to be able to share with you what's going on here in Mexico and Central America. NARRATOR: Children of God were the original camcorder cut. Thousands of hours of videos were made to show David Berg every detail of day-to-day activities in the group. Yet the method David Berg chose to communicate with his followers was by the so-called MO letters. The MO stood for Moses David, one of the names used by David Berg. He also liked to be addressed as Father David, dad, or grandpa. The MO letters, a quirky mix of comic book pictures and religion, controlled every aspect of his followers' lives. SYLVIA: I believe his writings implicitly. I used to read his writings, and I thought-- I used to think that they were inspired by God. And so I would believe them, I'd obey them. VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: Here's Zek is teaching a class on the end time. Really trying to give the children the end time vision, and what should they do. The "endtime" dominated the religious beliefs of Children of God. This was a specific date according to Berg, that the world would end and Christ would return. SYLVIA: Because there was a tentative year for the second coming of Christ, there was this big pressure, get as many souls as you can. And stock up with food, because there's going to be tough times coming. So you don't want to be caught out. MALE INTERVIEWER: year were you told that Christ was going to come? 1993. And it seemed long enough-- a long time away at that particular time. So it seemed highly possible, taking into account all the different things happening in the world. MALE INTERVIEWER: So everything you were doing was geared up to the fact that Christ would come back in 1993? Absolutely. Yes. [sighs] Yeah. [video playback, singing] My mommy is having a baby. It's coming from heaven above. My mommy is having a baby. We'll give him a name, it's all been arranged. But most important of all, we'll give him our lives. Mommies were constantly having babies inside the Children of God, as contraception was banned. [laughter] NARRATOR: Sylvia already had two daughters, Shuly and Debbie. And in Costa Rica she gave birth to two more girls-- in 1973, Miriam, and then the next year, Victoria. Two boys followed over the next two years. And then, some time later, Sylvia's seventh child, another girl. SYLVIA: I never wanted to have as many children as I did have. Obviously, I mean, in this modern world, to have seven children is a tremendous amount. But you felt that you have given birth to your children in a group that was in the center of God's world, that he'd look after your children, and give you the physical and spiritual strength for them. [video playback] [SINGING] Do it right now. When you're asked to sweep the floor, do it right now. Do it right now. Do it right now. Do it right now. When someone says-- Please close the door. Do it right now. Do it right now. Do it right now. Everything we did was controlled because grandpa said so in the letters. Everything he said in the letters was followed, absolutely everything. Like for example, how to wipe your butt-- seriously-- three sheets of toilet paper, and no more. Because it's a waste of the Lord's money. We were told how much coffee or tea with could drink a day-- two cups, no more. Otherwise you were walking in disobedience. We could never go out alone, you always had to go out with a partner. You had to do things the way the Berg had written, laid down. All these little physical laws, how you were supposed to have your hair, or whether you could wear makeup or not, whether you wear skirts or trousers. VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: Kiddy viddy videos provide hours of delightful and wholesome entertainment that the whole family will want to watch again and again. CHILDREN SINGING IN VIDEO: --always said, do it 'cuz daddy said so. Do it 'cuz daddy said so. Do it 'cuz daddy said so. Trust. Obey. And do it 'cuz daddy said so. NARRATOR: A rather different face of Children of God was being revealed in the MO letters. David Berg had a bizarre contemporary interpretation of Christianity. His ideas on love, religion, and sex had already caused controversy. And Berg took those beliefs further. VIDEO PLAY BACK [MALE VOICE]: Love is everything. For without love there is nothing, no friends, no families, or fathers, or mothers, or children, or sex, or health, or happiness, or God, or heaven. There could be none of these without love. [music playing] NARRATOR: The first of his doctrines was a sharing, in which the followers of Children of God could share, have sex with any others in the group. These letters were coming out, and I was convinced that it was like a duty. I thought I was doing the right thing. It sounds incredible, doesn't it? MALE INTERVIEWER: Can you remember when you first took that plunge and did share with someone else? Yes, I remember it very clearly. I had to take two stiff scotches beforehand. [laughs] I was very nervous about it. I mean, sometimes you're revolted. I mean, some of them were just plain unattractive, you just didn't want to have anything to do with them. But if you asked and you refused, you were going to be labeled selfish, unloving, uncaring, and that you didn't really belong in God's entire movement, the best movement on the earth, you see? And so that you felt that you were insufficient, that you weren't enough. And that you were failing somehow. MALE INTERVIEWER: And you never felt it was degrading or humiliating? Oh, it was humiliating, yes. We felt a bit lost, you know. Because it caused lots of division. And we had jealousy problems, too. It really bothered me that young, young men in their 20s would come and want to share with my mom, who was a mother of already like five children. And she was a lady, you know. I tried to be very discreet. But there's no way in which you can hide things from children. I was naive enough to think I could hide it from children, but they knew. And they suffered, they really suffered from terrible insecurity because of it. MIRIAM: Oh, yes. I remember we were having a sort of fellowship in our house in Costa Rica. And 6:00 o'clock came along, and everybody started leaving. And this one particular "uncle" would not budge. And I was, like, mom, when is Simon going? You know. And she was, like, oh, I don't know. And she was sort of like trying to honor it and get us to bed. Our bedtime was 8:00 o'clock, you know. Mommy, Simon hasn't gone yet. See-- all of us kids were asking, why hasn't Simon left? I remember at about 10:00 o'clock, when I was supposed to be asleep-- I couldn't go to sleep-- I went to knock on mommy's door. And so she opened the door a little bit, and squeezes herself out and closes the door behind her. She says, yes? You know. And I was, like, and I knew what was going on. And she knew that I knew as well, and she was very embarrassed, you know. She didn't want us children to know. And I remember just going back to bed. I made some stupid excuse, oh, you know, I just wanted to see how she'd react to see if the guy was really there. And so I went back to bed, and I told Victoria, Victoria, guess what? You know. Ooh, yuck, what a pig, you know. How dare he? [laughs] We were really upset, you know. And I was very upset. So my mom-- I literally hated her, because I felt so insecure. You know. [music playing] VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: Even sunshine is God's love to you. It is the light and power that shows his love by making the world go around. Love-making is all a physical illustration of what God does to us through the power and light of his love. Love is the power and light of God. [music playing] [indistinct chatter] NARRATOR: The children of God cult had been Sylvia Padilla's life now for nearly 10 years. She was bringing up six children, her husband was regularly sharing with other women, and she had to be available to the men of the cult. She felt trapped. You've given up everything, and you really have nowhere to go. You've given up money, houses, career. If you'd been many years there, you can't even work, and you've got a lot of children. Those are physical reasons, but it's the spiritual, mind control, it's the stronger one that keeps you there. You are under this total conviction that you're walking out of God's will, that something horrible will happen to you if you leave, because you are losing his protection upon your life. You are actually conditioned to think that the outside world although there are many lovely people in it, that they are all under the control of the Devil. There's that all over business of knowing that you belong to something that was actually controlling you, which stopped that sense of normality and real freedom. It was like this invisible cords holding you. [video playback] NARRATOR: The Children of God were flourishing. Saving souls for Jesus was the goal, and witnessing was the method. MALE VOICE SINGING: Who will take a stand, and heed the call from heaven above. VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: And now, for a witnessing adventure, here are the teams going out in the van. Normally, we try and divide them up between the other homes. [singing continues] --and die for the Kingdom. Here's one team going into the main way that we've been witnessing, and that's going into offices. [singing continues] --sword, look to heaven-- Sorry it's a bit dark. [singing continues] It's the revolution for Jesus, and David our King. And this manager of this bank, would never refuse a little child's asking him to pray with him. NARRATOR: Children of God had acquired a new name-- The Family-- and become a major missionary organization. They had tens of thousands of members, and a master plan to bring their brand of Christianity to all the countries of the world. [singing continues] Who will there to go? Armed with-- VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: Dear Esther, winning hearts with her charm. [singing continues] With the endtime army that's conquering-- NARRATOR: Witnessing alone was not sufficient to win converts. David Berg dreamt up a more radical plan, flirty fishing. SYLVIA: Flirty fishing was considered going to the ultimate to win a soul for Christ. If he's hungry, you'll feed him. And then, it goes on even further. If he needs sex, you'll give him that too, if that's what it takes to win him. MALE INTERVIEWER: Was this literally going out to bars, or to hotels, to pick up men? It sounds rather crude that way, because when you're sincere, you didn't look on it that way. You looked at it that you're going out, and you get to-- by your physical charms-- attract someone and talk to them. And if you could win them for Christ without giving them everything, that was so much-- as far as I'm concerned-- that was so much better. But there were occasions in which it went all the way. A lot of the homes turned into [sighs] pretty much brothels. It was like the whole temple worship. You know, the girls were just there. MALE INTERVIEWER: And if the men gave you money, then that was fine? Yeah. In fact, there was a letter that came out, which said, make it pay. In other words, if you're going-- girls, if you're giving them everything, they might as well pay you. MALE INTERVIEWER: And your husband and your children, all knew that you were having to do this flirty fishing? Well, yes, they did. I must say again, it was rare in my case, actually, it was rare. But on the rare occasions, they did know. I thought the children didn't, but they did. When I smelt perfume in the air. When I saw her put lipstick on, I knew. MALE INTERVIEWER: How old were you then? I was between the ages of about 7 and 10. That was the worst times. That's when she went out the most. NARRATOR: Victoria remembers coming home one night to discover her mother had gone away for the weekend with a man she had fished. I felt rotten. I couldn't believe it. I felt betrayed by my own mother, you know. That I should be away, and come back, and not see her there. I just felt, especially seeing that she was with another man, that was even worse. I asked her, I said, mom, did you sleep in the same room as this man? Or did you sleep in separate rooms? And she said, mind your own business. That just cut me up into little pieces, you know. I just felt awful, because I knew what the answer was. I knew that she was with him. SYLVIA: A lot of this "effing", as they called it, went and got out of hand. Because the women were almost like virtual slaves-- childbearing, cleaning house, cooking. And if they have any extra time, they're out on the streets winning people, selling their tapes and posters. So when the idea of actually sitting in a rather nice hotel, having a meal, with someone who's paying a bit of attention, it's almost like heaven. It's a break. It was selfish. If I'd known my daughter was coming back, I wouldn't have gone. But I know it's had a devastating effect. I tried to explain to her, but she finds it very hard to understand. And I feel very, very, very about it. MALE INTERVIEWER: Can you believe now that you allowed to get yourself into such a position? I wish I hadn't. But I can believe it because I know what it's like to actually have my mind controlled. And I believe that someone whose mind is controlled, it can be capable of doing almost anything, if it's presented in the right way. [girls laughing] GIRL 1: This is great. GIRL 2: OK, girls. But don't cover up too quick. You know, they like us. A nice long look. So now he doesn't get to appreciate you, your beauty that often. So-- [chatter] Wait, wait. She's showing how we bed down here, guys. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. Hi daddy, I love you. I hope you were here right next to me. [laughter] I'm dreaming about you tonight. Tonight. I love you so much, especially when you said you'd kiss my sexy lips. just love that. [laughter] EVERYBODY: Good Night. We love you. We love you. Good bye. [music playing] NARRATOR: In 1976, the Padilla family moved into a house in another part of Costa Rica's capital, San Jose. For the family, the house will always be associated with Shuly. Shuly, like her parents, was a devout follower of David Berg. Yet she had protected her younger sisters, and had helped to keep the family together. But when she was 15, she contracted lupus, a disease of the body's immune system. She couldn't go out in the hot sunshine, because it exaggerated all her symptoms. So she was very, very bored. And she'd read a lot of books. Now we were not allowed in the group to read books. It was considered time wasting and worldly. And my husband was very legalistic about this book-reading business. He said, we're not supposed to read books. And so in the end, we were have these big arguments about it. So she wrote to Berg himself, a letter, saying, you know, I got this illness. I'm home all day. And I like to read books. My mommy says I can't. My dad says I can't. And this letter was printed with a comment by Berg afterwards, and saying, well, perhaps lupus is the answer. In other words, implying that because she is disobedient and reading books, that was why she got sick. It obviously devastated her. We were encouraged in the group not to take any kind of medicine. We were not forbidden, but you felt that if you did take it, you were failing somehow. You felt really guilty. And she felt guilty that she was actually totally depend upon drugs, because she'd feel so ill without them. And because of this guilt trip they put you on, the poor girl would feel totally inadequate. She felt she was failing God, what had she done wrong? She went-- what have I done wrong? She would pray, and feel really dreadful. NARRATOR: In 1982, Shuly's condition deteriorated. She agonized whether she should keep taking the medication that was controlling her disease, but the guilt was too much. With her parents agreement, she stopped the treatment. My sister was really sick, and she'd been unconscious for about three days. And she was sitting on a big chair right here. It was a big, soft chair right here. And I was feeding her some soup. And I was the only one in the room. And she just died, right there. She just breathed everything out. And I remember, I remember, just standing here, going like this. Standing here. And just couldn't believe it. I was just like-- I just couldn't move. I just froze to this piece of wall right here. Just looking, and not knowing what to do. And I felt so bad that my mom had to come in and find out that she died, you know. And then mom came in, and I was in such a horrible state, I just walked out. And I had to go out of the house, I couldn't stay in the house. And one of the worst shocks that has ever happened in my life was when I walked back in. And I was going to the kitchen, and I had to look in the room-- it was about-- that door was about that much open. And I saw my sister's body lying on the bed with her head covered with a sheet. And that was just absolutely horrible. That was really terrible. It was a lot of trauma really. It was hell on Earth. MALE INTERVIEWER: What was the reaction of the Children of God to the death of your daughter? You know, they never came to pray for me or for her. I got one little card from some leaders. It was an embarrassment to them, I believe. I actually think now, looking back on it, it was an embarrassment, because it was a failure. No one's supposed to die in the Children of God. No one's supposed to get sick in the children of God. NARRATOR: Shuly was 17 when she died. 11 of those years had been spent inside the cult. And still kept faithful to the group. Amazing, isn't it? It shows that that control is totally abnormal. It's not a normal thing. My parents didn't click, or didn't twig. Is it because my parents were brainwashed at this point as well. They believe that, you know, God could have healed her. But you know, the Lord decided to take her home, because she was too good for this world. And all this, you know. I think she had a lot to offer to this world. And I feel very cheated. And I wish she were alive today. [inaudible]. [crying] [sad music playing] NARRATOR: Sometime later, David Berg added his own inimitable epitaph to Shuly. He wrote this sort of dream he had about Shuly. He went to heaven, and according to him, he saw Shuly there. And of course, his perverted mind went into, oh, yes, I don't have sex with Shuly in heaven, you know. And he went into some very gory details. And I remember I was extremely offended, and my sister Debbie, and myself, and Victoria, we got together, and we thought, what a pervert. How dare he talk about our dead sister like this. How dare he. [video playback] [singing in spanish] NARRATOR: A Children of God concert party in Costa Rica, shortly after the death of Shuly. All appeared as wholesome as ever, with Victoria and Debbie singing in their family group. But behind the smiles, the cult's obsession with sex was beginning to affect the children. [singing in spanish] I had an education of sex at an age where you should be completely ignorant, you should be completely oblivious to it. I mean, this preoccupation with it, I didn't think it was right. I never did. I thought, isn't there more to life than just talking about sex, sex, sex, all the time? [singing in spanish] NARRATOR: And for Miriam singing here, harrasment began while she was still a youngster. [singing in spanish] You have to sort of grow up quick. So you're in the kitchen washing dishes, and a guy comes up, and hugs you, and starts groping at your breasts, and starts squeezing your bum, and slobbering all over your neck, and you just learn to grin and bear it. That's what it's all about. [video playback] It was so open. People would have a party, people would strip and start-- you know-- having sex in the bedrooms [video playback] One time when I was 11 there was this party going on. And they started to have this sort of like strip dance things. And they wanted us kids to do it too. So some of the kids went ahead and did it. And they tried to get me to strip as well. I was so scared I was shitting myself. I thought, these people could do anything to me. These people could do anything they want. And I can't do anything because I'm only little. Because I'm only a child. So I got-- you know-- you know, honey, why don't you share your body? You know. God gave you such a beautiful body, you know. They tried to get into your brain, and tell you that Jesus wanted to do it. And I said no, no, I don't want to. And I went into the loo, and I locked myself in the loo, and I cried my eyes out. NARRATOR: She couldn't stop them for long. Within a couple of years, Miriam, then 14, and Victoria, who was just 13, were pressurized by the group to perform stripteases. [video playback] [SINGING] You can help me, heed me from falling. I know you love me. For the three Padilla girls, the impact of Children of God's sexual freedom was to get worse. [SINGING] You know I wish you to help me. And I got to something to hold on too. This David Berg letter seemed to indicate the acceptability of sexual contact with young children. And some of the adults in the group lost no time in following his teaching. [VIDEO PLAY BACK, SENSUAL MUSIC PLAYING] And the existence of these private Children of God videos, with very young children performing stripteases made for the pleasure of the cult's leadership, provided further reinforcement that the sexual exploitation of children was acceptable within the group. [sensual music keeps playing] [traffic] At the Padilla family home in Costa Rica, the inevitable occurred with a Children of God member assigned to live in their home. I was sitting in a room with the children in it, our room, back with our bunk beds and so on. And I was wearing a night dress, and he just started, you know, fondling me, and so on. And I felt very guilty about it, you know. I just tried to forget it. It was only one incident, but I was only seven, I was very young. And it disturbed me quite a bit. When I was about 9, 9 and 1/2, he started to abuse me. I don't know. He used to drink a lot. I don't know if it was the influence of the cog, mixed with the alcohol and the MO letters. Because he seemed to, like, get off on abusing me, and coming in my bedroom at night and bothering me. It was really horrible. Because he controlled me in every way, you know. Because he also discipline me, and he spanked me, and slapped me, and stuff, and showed his authority over me. But then at night, it was something else. He had me as if I was his woman or something, you know. And I never talked to him about it. I was really scared. And I was really scared to tell my parents too. He was a member of the Children of God. He would read the MO letters. He would sing the songs. He would witness. And he would abuse me. Something suddenly clicked. I started to be very pretty at 12:00, and I said, you're not trying to sort of hold your hand, or something like that, is he? And she said, well, sort of. And then the whole story came out. And my husband was away at the time. And I just thought, what do I do? This is absolutely terrible. And this man was out, and when he came in, I didn't even question-- I didn't even question him. I didn't even ask him. I believed my daughter. And I told him he was out. And he did say, he did confess it to me. And I said, you're out. MALE INTERVIEWER: With your own daughter having been systematically abused for three years from the age of nine, you found out, and your reaction still was not to leave the group. I thought it was him. I thought it was that guy. I did not realize that it was an all-pervading spirit of immorality that was just covering the whole group. At the end of the take I was masturbating to you. And when I came, I broke out in strong tongues. I couldn't control it. And the last few words were father, I love you. And, um, sorry. So Jon is shy a little bit, but it was really a beautiful experience. [music from video playback] NARRATOR: Another video for the pleasure of David Berg from his loving disciples, nothing was too much for him. Yet the cult's activities were starting to create controversy in a number of countries. David Berg, by now in his 70s, had disappeared from public view. This is the last known picture. He's only communication with the outside world was through the MO letters. His hideout, a closely guarded secret. Berg urged his followers to move to fresh countries, partly to avoid persecution. The Padillas, after 12 eventful years in Costa Rica, moved out of their house in the country. They were entering a new phase of their life in the cult. VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: Share in the fun, in the fellowship, in the exciting action, as we reap and win this part of the world for Jesus. [youngsters singing] NARRATOR: In 1989, the Padilla family ended up back in Mexico after two years traveling from country to country as missionaries for David Berg. Debbie, Miriam, and Victoria were all now teenagers, and being trained to be loyal, adult members of Children of God. MIRIAM: I toed the line, I toed the line at least outwardly. In my outward appearance, I was a good girl in the group. I was reliable, and I was obedient. But within me, I used to wonder, is this going to be all my life? Is this what I'm going to do for the rest of my life? Having people tell me what to do all the time? Not being able to make my own decisions? Not even being able to make my own decisions about what I'm going to wear, or what I'm going to do tomorrow. VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: And as the sun comes up over the beautiful mountains around teen camp, let's take a look around, and into some of the bungalows, to catch a glimpse of some of the early morning activity. [SINGING] Take a look outside. VIDEO PLAYBACK [MALE VOICE]: As you can see, this is the daily schedule we've been following here at teen camp. MIRIAM: We were taught, and it was drilled into us, that the outside world was doomed to destruction. They were constantly drilling into your brain that you're not going to live more than really-- 25 is the most you're going to live, you know. So therefore there's no need to study. There's no need for a career. The only thing that you're supposed to do is to be faithful until the end, faithful in the little things. [VIDEO PLAYBACK IN SPANISH - "LA BAMBA"] NARRATOR: With the end of the world coming, the fight was to win converts to Jesus. The battleground became the tourist halls of Acapulco. Victoria-- here performing center stage-- Miriam, and Debbie, were assigned to tour the result singing and saving souls. [VIDEO PLAYBACK IN SPANISH - "LA BAMBA"] [SINGING] Smile though your heart is breaking. Smile even though is we're sinking. When there are clouds in the sky, you'll get by if you smile through the pain and sorrow. We definitely had to smile through our pain and sorrow. Do you remember how they control like, we all feel the same inside, remember that song? Oh, yeah. How'd it go, Miriam? [SINGING] And we all feel the same inside. And we all want to do or die. We believe that it's possible to live for God, and we love you, David, our King. That's ridiculous. I don't think anybody loves him. MIRIAM [SINGING]: And we will follow you through everything. [interposing voices] No, we did. We did follow him through everything, you know. VICTORIA: Through everything. MIRIAM: I mean, if he would have told us, you know, set yourself on fire, we probably would have done that. Seriously. DEBBIE: Do we-- Well, you were supposed to burn free, honey. - [laughs]. - You remember? Praise the Lord. Remember that song, are you willing to be-- remember that song? ALL [SINGING]: Are you willing to be a fighter for Jesus. Amen. ALL [SINGING]: Are you willing to live your life for the light. Yes, sir. ALL [SINGING]: Are you willing to give your best to him forever. So he can help your light to shine. Come join the army. Take up the cross. Don't be afraid. You won't get lost. Just follow Jesus. Do what he says, and you'll be thankful when that river you finally cross. Are you willing to be a fighter for Jesus? NARRATOR: But as the Padilla girls were being sent out singing amidst the sleazy tourist nightlife of Acapulco, Berg was already beginning to clean up his act. Flirty fishing was stopped, partly because of the fear of AIDS. The group declared their strong opposition to any form of child abuse. New controls were introduced about sharing and sexual behavior within their communities. The tragedy was that the changes came too late to help Debbie Padilla, who was then 15. Because I was young, the leaders would go after me. And I would have to share with the leaders, which was worse. Because I probably could refuse another person, and maybe get told off by it, but I could not refuse a leader. MALE INTERVIEWER: So as soon as you were 15 the leaders of the group would force you to have sex with them. Yes. I had to. They made me feel really-- I don't know-- really unclean. NARRATOR: Inevitably, with contraception banned by David Berg, Debbie became pregnant by one of the married leaders of the group at the age of 18. Richie was born in 1988, the third generation of the Padilla family in the cult. And while still a young baby, he too, suffered. DEBBIE: There was one particular incident that was very unpleasant, that Richie was 10 months, and he got spanked by the shepherdess of the home he lived in. And she was really cruel to him. She kept spanking him until he stopped crying, you know. And I felt like rushing at her, and slapping her. But because I was under such control, I couldn't do anything about it. I just had to stare and watch my kid being spanked really hard on the bottom. He was only 10 months old. NARRATOR: Two years later, Debbie gave birth to her second child, Jamie, fathered by another member of the group. She stayed with the cult in Mexico, living with her sons. Sylvia Padilla, with Miriam, Victoria, and the three younger children, finally decided to return to England. Miriam, then 16, and fully involved in the cult, went alone to live in this Children of God home in North London. MIRIAM: I really thought that I was going to end up married off to someone I probably didn't love. And I'd probably end up being another baby factory, like all the other women in the group are. And for me, that was the most claustrophobic feeling ever. I used to look out this window. I used to wonder if I ever could drive a car myself, you know. And I thought, forget it, you know, there's just no way you're ever going to drive a car. I feel sick in here. Should we go? Oh, gosh, it just brings me back so much claustrophobia. It's just nasty. MALE INTERVIEWER: Why didn't you just walk out of the door? Because I didn't know anything else. MALE INTERVIEWER: Why not? Why just-- get out of the house? Because you just don't do that. Where would I go? That thought didn't even enter my head. You know, it wasn't because I was stupid. No. It's because you're programmed into thinking that if you ever leave, something really terrible is going to happen to you. A car is going to come by and hit you. You're going to get raped, mugged. The system, the outside world is evil. NARRATOR: Miriam could no longer stand being separated from her family, who had now been classified as part-time members of the cult. Children of God, anxious to keep her under their control, said she was not allowed to see her mother except under strict supervision. I didn't believe it. I'd put up with all sorts of things before by putting the blame on individuals, but this was actually a policy that was so totally un-Christian, so totally unnatural, that I just wasn't-- I just refused to accept it. And that was-- that was the straw that broke the camel's back. NARRATOR: It was the turning point. For the first time, after 18 years of control under David Berg, Sylvia decided to challenge the leadership. She insisted Miriam should be returned to her. And they bunged me in a train, and when I got home, I thought, what a relief. I'm never going back, never going back. And I never went back. I thought freedom, freedom, you know. NARRATOR: The family were reunited. This one, simple incident was sufficient for Sylvia to break loose from the powerful control of Children of God. For Sylvia, Miriam, and Victoria, in England, there was at last freedom. [indistinct chatter] SYLVIA: It was very hard for us to leave. It was 18 years of total commitment. But I wasn't going to live in a society that could control us to such a tremendous degree, to say when or when we should not see our own children. [music playing] NARRATOR: Debbie was still alone in Mexico, separated from the rest of the family. But when the group tried to force her into a marriage, she decided to follow her mother and cut all ties with the Children of God. [music playing] They shouldn't exist. It's got no meaning at all, because everything this David Berg prophesied never happened. MALE INTERVIEWER: In a sense, do you blame your parents for dropping you into all of this? In a way I do. But I know I have to forgive them. I can't help but blame my parents to a certain extent for their stupidity. Because I don't think I would put up with the things I put up with without kicking up a fuss or just getting out of the group altogether. In a way, I do blame them. One day, shortly after we left, I got all children together, and I asked their forgiveness. Because I'd really lead them into things that in my normal mind I would never have done. But I had to forgive myself, otherwise you can't live with that kind of thing, you have to go on. And since I've left, I've tried my best to give the children as normal life as possible, and come to terms with their different traumas that they've suffered. [music playing] [video playback] [SINGING] H-A-P-P-Y, we are happy. Why not try a kiss, a smile, throughout the day. Happiness is here to stay. H-A-P-P-Y, we are happy. Why not try a kiss, a smile, throughout the day. Happiness is here to stay. NARRATOR: The Family today, the group that was Children of God, now project a wholesome, Christian image through their publicly available videos. [singing continues] --and not give up. H-A-P-P-Y, we are happy. Why not try a kiss, a smile throughout the day-- NARRATOR: Their reclusive leader, David Berg, remains as shadowy as ever. He was last heard of in the Philippines. But his group is flourishing, with 10,000 members around the world. Their British base is a country house in Leicestershire. The group refused permission to film at any of their centers. But their spokesperson, Solomon, did agree to be interviewed. The Family is a group of individuals who've been touched by Jesus Christ. And you can summarize the work of The Family in the commandment that the Lord gave to all his disciples. And that is, go ye, into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. We try to do that by sample, by word, in any way that we possibly can according to the countries that we're in. If it's social work, or if it's personal counseling, or if it's through music, in any way possible, literature, whatever. We are commissioned by the Lord to preach the good news of his gospel, and that's exactly what The Family is doing. MALE INTERVIEWER: You're a missionary organization. Exactly. NARRATOR: Solomon was a member of Children of God in Costa Rica, and knew the Padilla family well. MALE INTERVIEWER: Do you accept that the Padilla family were devoted members of the Children of God for nearly 20 years? No. The Padilla family were not devoted members of the Children of God for 20 years. Well, on their account, they devoted their lives. And they followed to the letter the teachings of their leader, David Berg. Are you saying that that did not happen? I understand that they say that. I'm telling you that that did not happen. I know that for a fact. MALE INTERVIEWER: Well, what were doing for 20 years? I know that for 20 years, they basically lived a life what they wanted to do. [video playback] I'm not going to judge the Padilla's dedication to the Lord, that's between them and God. But what I can tell you, as a witness, is that they were not living in the mainstream membership of The Family. Regardless of what they say. MALE INTERVIEWER: Well, that's completely at odds from what they are telling us. Right. MALE INTERVIEWER: So we have two different versions. Exactly. MALE INTERVIEWER: Why should we believe you? You don't have to believe me. You don't have to believe me. That's going to be up to the public to decide. And I'll just have to trust God that people will see the truth and the sincerity. MALE INTERVIEWER: Sylvia Padilla has told us how she had to share following the teachings of David Berg, that is she had to be available sexually to the men of the group. Now do you accept that sharing went on? Sharing-- OK. Sharing is a very personal thing. Nobody comes in and tells you you have to share with somebody. That's a very individualistic situation. The main concept in sharing that maybe differentiates us from maybe other churches, is that we believe that if two consenting adults-- male and female-- whichever relationship that is up to them. That's a very personal matter. I find it really difficult to believe that Sylvia would be forced by anyone to spend time with somebody else. That's absurd. How do you force somebody to do something like that unless there were slaves? Flirty fishing was another means of preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. Flirty fishing was never synonymous with sex. Flirty fishing it's a sacrificial way of giving your life for somebody else, of giving love to somebody else. The same way that Jesus Christ left the halls of heaven to come down to earth to relate to us-- to you, and to me, and to our viewers. Flirty fishing was a means to be able to reach out to others. It could be-- it could mean going to a bar and sitting and talking to somebody that's having a drink. It could be going to a park and sitting next to a person telling them about Jesus. It could be getting up and dancing with somebody. [video playback] MALE INTERVIEWER: Can you explain why the Children of God made explicit and often pornographic videos, some of them involving young children, for the use of the group? The Children of God-- The Family never-- the family has never produced pornographic videos. The Family has never produced pornographic videos. MALE INTERVIEWER: The Children of God? The Children of God have not produced pornographic videos. Pornography is not allowed in their homes. We don't consider pornography to be-- we consider that godly sex is good. In other words, God created sex. There's nothing wrong with that. God created it for our pleasure. We don't believe in pornography, and we do not produce pornography. MALE INTERVIEWER: So videos dedicated to David Berg involving scenes of masturbation, involving scenes of young children doing striptease routines, they have absolutely nothing to do with Children of God or the family. They don't. MALE INTERVIEWER: Why were they dedicated to David Berg? I have no knowledge of any videos that are dedicated to David Berg. I'll tell you, the type of videos that we produce are videos that are dedicated to reach children, and to help children, or to help people in general. MALE INTERVIEWER: Debbie Padilla has told us that she was sexually abused from the age of nine onwards by a member of the group. Do you accept her story? Whether it happened or not, I don't know. I wasn't there. I've heard about it, but I do know that when this supposed abuse took place, it was the Padilla's living independently as heads of their own household, and not living within a family home. That is their business. MALE INTERVIEWER: So this had nothing to do with the Children of God. This has nothing to do with The Family. This has nothing to do with The Family. Do you accept that various literature at that time did seem to indicate the acceptability of sexual contact with children? Never. MALE INTERVIEWER: Those MO letters did not exist? No, what I'm telling you is within our Family homes, within our literature, and within our practice, we do not believe in any crossovers between minors and adults whatsoever. It's an excommunicable offense. I feel bad that the Padilla family feels so bitter about their experience with The Family. But I have to bring up to you that there are thousands upon thousands of people that have been Family members, or continue being Family members, or are friends of The Family, who are very, very thankful to God and to The Family for bringing joy and peace and a purpose in their life. The Family is a lot more than the Padillas are saying. The Padillas are bringing up what their view is of their bitterness. NARRATOR: It is now two years since the Padilla family left Children of God. But for the children, and especially Debbie, building a normal life is proving difficult. DEBBIE: I feel very frustrated because I don't have any kind of qualifications, and I'm not doing what I'd like to do. I'm stuck alone with two children, I don't have a husband. And I have to fend for those two children. And both the fathers of those children are in the cult. And they couldn't care less about them. [interposing voices] NARRATOR: Miriam and Victoria are now living with their mother and younger brothers and sister in South London. They're adapting to a more ordinary lifestyle, and both have recently found jobs. That happens to be my ex-- They want no involvement with any religious group. [music playing] [SINGING] God is at work through us, his purpose to perform. It will be kingdom of power, an abode. Were things impossible, by faith should be made possible. Let's be the glory to him now. NARRATOR: Sylvia remains a Christian, despite firmly rejecting David Berg's brand of religion. She attends a conventional but informal church group in London. She has separated from her husband, and is struggling to bring up her family, as she deals with the legacy of having spent half her adult life inside Children of God. [church singing continues] The hope of glory in our hearts. He lives. He lives. He practices in you. We will rise. We will arise. We will rise. We will rise. [clapping] Hallelujah.
