SOMEBODY IN THERE? WHO'S IN THERE? HEY! HEY! WHAT'S GOING ON? WHO'S OUT THERE? WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL? LET ME OUT OF HERE! LUNAR WAS BUILT ON THE SITE WHERE A METEORITE CRASHED THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO. WHY WOULD ANYONE WANT TO LIVE IN A PLACE LIKE THIS? WELL, I GREW UP HERE, AND SO WHEN I CAME BACK HOME A FEW MONTHS AGO, I HEARD THE CABINS WERE UP FOR SALE SO I BOUGHT THEM AND MOVED IN. LUNAR. SOUNDS LIKE IT SHOULD BE SOME PLACE IN NEW MEXICO. DOESN'T IT? YOU BEEN THERE? I THINK TURQUOISE AND SILVER SHOULD BE WORN SEPARATELY OR BANNED. [BREATHES] YOU LIVE IN VEGAS, RIGHT? YEAH. THIS WEEK I DO.

Abby: IS THERE ANY CHANCE I CAN GET A SHOWER WHEN WE GET THERE? OH, YEAH. CABINS HAVE SHOWERS. BUT ONCE WE'RE ON THE TRAIL, IT'S JUST THE RIVER. PROVIDING A NIPPY IF EXISTENTIAL CLEANLINESS. HOW FAR IS AREA 51 FROM LUNAR? THERE IS NO AREA 51. YEAH. HE SHOULD KNOW. HE WAS IN THE AIR FORCE THERE. ABBY. HEY, FOR REAL? THERE'S NO AREA 51. IT'S A MILITARY BASE. IT'S PART OF THE NUCLEAR TRIAD. I FLEW CHOPPERS. I NEVER SAW NO ALIENS, NO SAUCERS, AND NO UFOs. THE GOVERNMENTS DON'T ALWAYS WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW THE TRUTH. YOU PEACE AND BROWN RICE GENERATION? YOU STILL FLY THERE? I LEFT THE MILITARY 7 YEARS AGO. YEAH. HE GOT TIRED OF ALL THE MOVING AROUND. NOW HE WORKS FOR THE OIL COMPANIES. HE MOVES AROUND JUST AS MUCH, BUT A LOT FURTHER AWAY. DAD! Hope: THERE'S THAT IDIOT'S TRUCK. Abby: THAT'S WEIRD. WHY'D HE STOP? LET ME OUT OF HERE! [BANGING] HEY, COME ON, PLEASE! LET ME OUT OF HERE! IT'S FREEZING IN HERE! WELL, THE BIG EXCITEMENT HAPPENED ABOUT 17 YEARS AGO, BUT I WAS IN CHICAGO THEN, SO I NEVER SAW ANYTHING, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE SAY THEY SAW SOME KIND OF UFO HOVERING OVER THE BASE AND LOTS OF LITTLE ALIENS CLIMBING DOWN. LIKE THOSE ONES IN ROSWELL. AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ALWAYS DENIED ANYTHING HAPPENED, BUT YOU TRY GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR THE BASE... DO YOU BUY INTO THAT STUFF? A LOT OF PEOPLE FIND IT INTERESTING. THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF PSYCHIC ENERGIES IN PLACES OF GREAT EMPTINESS. WHAT'S THAT? Thad: WHY IS THAT TRUCK THERE? I HAVE NO IDEA. Hope: IT WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD THIS MORNING. [ENGINE STARTS] MUST BE ONE OF PHIL'S. WHAT'S IT DOING ON THE ROAD? THAT'S WEIRD. I DON'T SEE HIM AROUND. ALIENS AT LARGE.

Pete: I TELL YOU WHAT, SOMETHING'S GOING ON. [TV CRACKLES] George: HEY, QUIET. SOMETHING'S COMING ON THE TV. LISTEN TO THIS. Sheriff: ELECTRICITY IS OUT FOR MOST AREAS. WE'RE ASKING EVERYBODY NORTH OF BRIDGETON TO JUST HOLD ON. IT'LL BE AT LEAST 24 HOURS BEFORE WE CAN GET TO YOU. EVERYONE SHOULD STAY INSIDE. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PLENTY OF WATER. WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT CHEMICALS THE TANKER WAS CARRYING, BUT AN EMERGENCY RESPONSE TEAM IS ON ITS WAY. UNFORTUNATELY, THE AIRPORT HAS BEEN CLOSED DOWN BECAUSE OF THE TOXIC CLOUD SO IT'LL BE SOME HOURS BEFORE THAT TEAM CAN GET TO US TO HELP WITH THE CLEANUP. IN THE MEANTIME, ONCE AGAIN, WE ASK EVERYONE TO STAY INSIDE, AND WE WILL KEEP YOU INFORMED, AND--AND JUST HANG ON. I REPEAT, JUST HANG ON. [STATIC] BASE, THIS IS ANDROMEDA 601. DO YOU COPY? OVER. BASE, THIS IS ANDROMEDA 601. DO YOU COPY? OVER? [STATIC] YEAH, WE'RE ABOUT 30 MILES EAST OF GROUND ZERO. ROGER THAT. BETTER SUIT UP. OH, MY GOD. WHAT? THAT GUY'S INSANE! WHAT'S HE DOING?

Reporter: GOT A MESSAGE THROUGH BEFORE HIS CB WENT DOWN. WE'RE HEARING A LOT OF REPORTS OF CBs DOWN. PROBABLY SOME SORT OF ELECTRICAL INTERFERENCE IS THE BEST GUESS SO FAR. NOW, WE REPEAT, THIS IS A MAJOR CHEMICAL SPILL. STATE EMERGENCY SERVICES ARE ON THEIR WAY TO START A CLEANUP. WE'VE HEARD THAT EVEN A SMALL AMOUNT OF THIS STUFF ON YOUR TIRES COULD PROVE HAZARDOUS. FRICTION, FIRE, DANGEROUS SMOKE... IF INHALED COULD ACTUALLY PROVE FATAL. SO, PLEASE, IF YOU'RE OUTSIDE THE AREA, DO NOT MAKE ANY ATTEMPT TO ENTER BRIDGETON, AND WHEREVER YOU ARE, JUST STAY INSIDE. AS SOON AS THERE IS CLEARANCE, THEY WILL BE CHOPPERING OUT TO YOU. JUST HANG ON, FOLKS. THEY WILL GET TO YOU. "JUST HANG ON"? YEAH, SURE, JUST HANG ON FOR WHAT?

George: WHAT'S GOING ON? WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I DON'T KNOW. Jack: THEY WANT THE ATTENTION. Ray: WHAT? THEY'RE MAKING A STATEMENT. WHAT? YOU GOT A BETTER IDEA? LET'S JUST HOPE THEY HAVEN'T LEARNED TO READ. I ALWAYS KNEW THE INDUSTRIAL AGE WOULD END IN CHAOS. IT'S OUR FAULT. WE DON'T DESERVE THIS PLANET, THE WAY WE MISUSE IT. THESE TRUCKS WILL USE IT BETTER? COULDN'T DO IT ANY WORSE. [TRUCK HORN HONKS] PHONES ARE OUT. Abby: DAMN IT! Brad: HEY. IT'S NOT RUNNING. I'M GONNA CHECK IT OUT. KEEP AN EYE ON MY WIFE. HONEY, I'LL JUST BE IN HERE.

YEAH, MOST OF US ANYWAY. I HAVE A THEORY. OH, GREAT. YOU KNOW THAT RECENT COMET SHOWER? GO ON. I'M LISTENING. 2 WEEKS AGO. SEE, IT COULD HAVE BOMBARDED OUR ATMOSPHERE WITH ALIEN PARTICLES WHICH SOMEHOW INTERFERED WITH OUR ENERGY SIGNALS. AFFECTING RADIO WAVES, ELECTRICITY, ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF. THESE TRUCKS ARE OPERATING ON AN ACCIDENTAL ENERGY WAVE WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE AN INTELLIGENCE BEHIND IT-- NO. IT'S PROBABLY JUST A RANDOM... Bob: YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT. YOU KNOW, 30 YEARS AGO, THESE FELLAS ALMOST BROUGHT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT. BUT WHY TRUCKS? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. 2 WORDS: AREA 51. ANY TIME ANYTHING HAPPENS AROUND HERE, PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS POINTING AT AREA 51. YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT! YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT! SECRET BASE THAT DOESN'T EXIST, BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS ABOUT IT. NO ONE'S EVER ALLOWED IN. WHAT'S IT FOR? THIS IS ONE BIG GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY. I'M TELLING YOU. THE GOVERNMENT'S TAKING OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY. WELL, I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, NOW, COME ON. WHAT HAVE WE GOT HERE?! WHAT HAVE WE GOT?! HUH? WE GOT A RADIO OUTAGE, A POWER OUTAGE, WE GOT CRAZY MACHINES RUNNING AROUND OUTSIDE! WE'VE GOT A POISON CLOUD! THAT'S PROBABLY A VIRUS. THEY'RE TESTING SOMETHING. IT'S A GOVERNMENT EXPERIMENT, AND WE'RE JUST THE LITTLE WHITE MICE. AREA 51. NOTHING GOES ON THERE THAT WOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS. WELL, HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT? 'CAUSE I WAS IN THE AIR FORCE. I FLEW CHOPPERS OUT OF THERE FOR 2 YEARS. IT IS STRICTLY MILITARY. WELL, THEN YOU'RE PART OF IT. YOU JUST HAPPENED TO BE HERE ON A CAMPING TRIP? HUH? RIGHT? YEAH. YOU KNOW SOMETHING, DON'T YOU? YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON, AND YOU'RE GONNA TELL US RIGHT NOW. HEY, HEY! HEY. WHERE THE HELL DID THAT COME FROM? I KEPT IT OUT OF YOUR WAY. I'M SORRY, RAY. IT BELONGED TO MY DAD. KIND OF A SENTIMENTAL THING. WE COULD TRY AND TAKE OUT THEIR TIRES. YOU WON'T BLOW OUT ANY OF OUR TIRES WITH THAT PEASHOOTER. THAT'S JUST A .22. LISTEN TO ME! WHOA, WHOA. YOU GUYS ARE NOT GONNA BUST UP MY PLACE AND PUT THE REST OF US IN JEOPARDY! WE ACT TOGETHER! T.V. Announcer: AND NOW, A SPECIAL NEWS BULLETIN. THE LATEST WE HAVE ON THIS TOXIC SUBSTANCE IS THAT IT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS BC972. IT'S USED IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY AS A COMPONENT IN AN ADHESIVE MATERIAL USED IN ROCKETRY. THAT'S ALL THEY'LL TELL US AT THIS STAGE, BUT WE WILL BRING YOU MORE INFORMATION ON THIS BREAKING NEWS STORY AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE TO US. WHAT IF THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING? INANIMATE OBJECTS ABLE TO THINK. THEY COULD MAKE US THEIR SLAVES. WHAT THE HELL? SHIT. BC972? LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF GODDAMN AREA 51 TO ME. NO. THIS IS THAT CHEM-WARFARE STUFF WE AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE MAKING ANYMORE. YOU BETTER SUIT UP, BUDDY. I'LL GO CHECK ON THE GEAR. I'LL BE RIGHT THERE. I BETTER CALL THIS ONE IN. BASE. THIS IS ANDROMEDA 601. COME IN. [RADIO STATIC] THIS IS ANDROMEDA 601. BASE, COME IN. [RADIO STATIC] I REPEAT, THIS IS ANDROMEDA 601. BASE, COME IN. [BEEP] THIS IS ANDROMEDA 601. BASE, COME IN. OVER?

MY DAD WILL BE WORKING ON SOMETHING. OH, THAT'S GREAT. WE'RE WAITING FOR A BUNCH OF REDNECKS TO SAVE US. MY DAD'S NOT A REDNECK. WE'RE FROM DETROIT. DETROIT. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? HE DECIDED TO RELOCATE. I DIDN'T GET TO VOTE. YEAH, WELL, PARENTS CAN BE SERIOUSLY HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH. I ONLY GOT ONE LEFT. I STILL GOT 2, BUT ONLY ONE AT A TIME. Brad: ANY TOOLS HERE? YEAH. SHE KEEPS 'EM IN THE BACK. THE CARBURETOR'S CLOGGED, BUT IF I CAN CLEAN IT, I CAN GET THAT PICKUP GOING, AND WE ARE OUT OF HERE. HE'S GOOD WITH CARS. HE'S ALWAYS WORKING ON ONE OR 2 AT THE HOUSE. I THINK THAT'S REALLY WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, JUST WORK ON CARS. SO WHAT DOES HE DO? SELLS THEM. WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT WITH THE GUN? HE WON'T ALLOW GUNS ON THE PROPERTY. HE LOST HIS WIFE 2 YEARS AGO IN A RANDOM DRIVE-BY GANG SHOOTING IN DETROIT. I SHOULDN'T HAVE KEPT IT AROUND. IT MIGHT BE A GOOD THING YOU DID. Thad: RAY, COME HERE A MINUTE. LOOK AT THIS. YOU THINK THAT PIPE'S BIG ENOUGH TO CRAWL THROUGH? YEAH. YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE. IF THEY MAKE A SURPRISE RUN FOR IT, THEY'LL BE SAFE IN THERE. MEANWHILE WE CAN DISTRACT THESE TRUCKS SOMEHOW, AND THEY CAN GET BACK IN HERE. YEAH, IT'S WORTH A TRY. THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU. WHAT? THERE'S SOME HIGH-POWERED RADIO TELESCOPES AT THAT AIR FORCE BASE. SO? IT'S UNUSUAL. I DON'T KNOW IF NASA SET IT UP OR WHAT, BUT NASA HAD A PROGRAM CALLED S.E.T.I.-- SEARCH FOR EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE. CONGRESS CUT THE FUNDING ON THAT, DIDN'T THEY? YEAH, AFTER ONLY ABOUT A YEAR. RIGHT. WHAT? THIS GROUP OF SCIENTISTS GOT SOME PRIVATE FUNDING, AND THEY TOOK OVER MOST OF NASA's SCOPES AND THEIR COMPUTERS, AND THEY'RE STILL LISTENING. IT'S CALLED PROJECT PHOENIX. YOU THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS? NOT REALLY. WHAT IF I'M WRONG? DON'T TELL THEM. HEY, HEY, LOGAN. COME HERE. Abby: WHAT DRAINAGE PIPE?

WHERE EVERYONE ELSE IS. THAT'S SMART. I DON'T WANT TO STAY HERE ANYMORE, LOGAN. I CAN'T. [TRUCK HORN HONKS] DON'T DO THAT AGAIN. WE HAVE AN ESCAPE ROUTE. WE HAVE COMMUNICATION WITH MY DAD ACROSS THE ROAD. HE'LL TELL US WHEN. WHEN, THOUGH? HE'LL KNOW. JUST-- JUST HANG IN WITH ME, OK? WANT TO TRY TO SLEEP NOW? YOU STILL TAKE THESE? NOT VERY OFTEN. THEY'RE VERY STRONG. I WAS AN R.N. BEFORE I WAS MARRIED. GEORGE TOLD ME ABOUT YOUR WIFE. I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW. IT MUST HAVE BEEN HARD FOR YOU. LOGAN, TOO. I...
