Multicom Entertainment Group Jingle The people want the regime to fall! I'm cooking, can you go? I'm in the toilet! - Who is it? - Good morning. - I need to speak to Fatima. - I'm her sister. Who are you? Fatima doesn't know me, I'm a friend of Shady's. Read what I've slipped under the door. I'll wait here. What is it? - A message from Shady. - Who gave it to you? - A man outside who says he's his friend. - Has something serious happened? Soldiers usually bring bad news. The man outside is wearing normal clothes. He looks like a nice man. More reason not to trust him. Come, I don't want him to hear us. Read what it says. "Fatima, darling, Muhammad is my friend." "Let him in and listen to his advice as if it were mine. Love, Shady." - Nothing else? - Nothing else. Why didn't he call? Why didn't he write something more? I don't know. Let's listen to that man. Are you sure it's Shady's handwriting and signature? Yes, look! - What shall we do? - Shall we open? No, we'd better not. We don't let strangers in. Shady says he's his friend. Shady isn't here, he cannot confirm what's written in the note. - But he looks like a nice man. - You've already said that. We don't know whether that letter's been extorted from Shady with force. By who? How do I know? Right now the situation in Syria is bad. - That man could hurt us. - Aya, you're exaggerating. Did you read the note? Mr Muhammad, I'm Fatima. Give us a moment to get ready. Why did you say yes? The note is from my husband and I decide whether to open or not. May God's will be done. - Welcome. - Thank you. Is my husband okay? Shady, thank the Lord, is in fine health. Come in. Thank you. - There's already sugar in the tea. - Thank you. Fatima... I help the families of officers who desert the army. In two days, Shady will abandon his regiment and join the rebels fighting in Dar'a. Shady's decision doesn't only concern him, but your whole family. When Shady deserts the army, the secret service or even worse the shabiha, will rush here to get revenge. And they won't differentiate between wife or sister-in-law. Muhammad, are you sure about what you're saying? Absolutely. Shady says you should go to your aunt Bassma in Turkey. If you were arrested, Shady would be blackmailable and there'd be no hope for you. I've seen the atrocities that take place with my own eyes. I'll never be able to forget what I saw in Homs and Dar'a. And I'll never forget the cries of the parents of some children in Dar'a who had written on a wall "The people want the regime to fall". The soldiers of the regime told those fathers that they'd never give them their children back. That if they wanted other children they could go home and get their wives pregnant. Or they could send their wives to the barracks and they'd make them pregnant. That's what the shabiha are like. They're men without scruples or humanity. Mercenaries. Shady is asking you to be courageous. I, instead, am asking you to make your decision quickly. There's no time for hesitation. Aya... If we have to go to Turkey, then we'll go to Turkey. I'll call your husband so that you'll be able to speak to him. The telephone isn't being intercepted, but do not mention the desertion. Make it quick and it'll be alright. Hello, Shady. I'll pass you onto your wife. Hello? SÃ¬, Shady. Yes, darling, we're here with Mr Muhammad. We've heard and we've agreed... Yes. Okay. Be careful. I will pray for you every day. I love you, Shady. May God be with you. Aya, can you come here? Excuse me with Mr Muhammad, but I need to be alone now. - Say goodbye on my behalf too. - Okay. My sister asks to be excused, she's very upset. I understand. I'll come later with a friend. He will take you to Turkey. Take anything that is valuable or necessary, and leave the rest. - All right. - I'll go now. We've only been married for six months. - Are you worried for Shady? - I'm afraid what he's doing... ...will be of no use, no one is indispensable. Don't say that! Shady is risking his life for our freedom. - My freedom is my obedience to God. - Mine too. But God wants us to be happy, not slaves to a government. Does the death of thousands of people justify the fight for freedom? Could we ever be happy if innocent people were to be killed? You're saying this because you fear for your husband. - Shady has made the right choice. - You're wrong. I just don't want to see what I saw in Iraq again. The women run away and the husbands risk their lives. - Is that how it works? - That's how it works. I'll run away from death, but I'm not expecting to have a nice life. Dad. Let's leave it here. I'd like to hope that one day we'll come back. - Peace be with you. - And with you too. - Is she one of the two women? - Yes. This is Fatima. - This woman's wearing a niqab! - Fatima, can we come in? - Of course. - Farid. - I bet she's the second woman, right? - You've won the bet. Stop messing around. They're both wearing niqabs and you knew it! - Of course I did. - I'm going! I'm not taking women wearing niqabs. Is that clear? Fatima, is there a room where I can talk to Farid in private? The kitchen. There's nothing to talk about. It's a no. In Syria, one woman out of a hundred wears the niqab. You managed to find two together! Why propose something as crazy as this to me? It's not crazy. Isn't it? You're right, it's even worse. It's the best way to get arrested by the police or killed by the shabiha. I'd never have expected this from someone like you. Calm down, Farid, there's always a solution. I don't want to end up in jail because of you. - Don't be a scaredy-cat, Farid. - A scaredy-cat? You don't know what prison is like. People are tortured with electric shocks or hung by their wrists for days at a time. You're being well-paid for the risks you're taking. No amount of money can compensate for death. Don't you realise, Farid? I'm taking a risk too if they arrest you and you talk. I don't even know if Muhammad is your real name. I don't know where you live. I don't know your surname. All I know is that you're safe in your house. Let's sit down. Farid, in less than 72 hours those girls risk being arrested. Only you and I can prevent that. Turkey is 200 kilometres away. It'll be impossible to travel that far with them in niqabs. If soldiers or the police stop me what will I say? I'm saying this for their safety too. - Travel along secondary roads then. - I already do. But no road is safe. Don't you understand? Are you saying you're not going to help them? I'm saying that I'll take them only if they remove their niqabs. Persuade them to do that and I'll keep my word. I'm sorry that our faith is a hindrance. - You heard everything? - You were speaking very loudly. What do you think of Farid's proposal? We understand his point of view, but we cannot remove our niqabs. We cannot go against our beliefs. Farid, listen. I'll add another 10,000 liras to the agreed price. 20,000 is a good proposal. We don't want you to pay for us. Not now, Fatima. All right, 20,000. Half today and the rest when you get back. - All of it now. - Don't push your luck. Wait here for me, we won't be long. Let's go. Here. Now you know where I live too. May God bless this home. Amen, o Lord. Let's go. Don't be afraid. Farid is greedy, but he's a good man. He will take you across the border safely. When you get to Turkey, call this number. Learn it off by heart. Now go, you have a long journey ahead. Thank you for everything you have done for us. I'm just doing my duty. Are you from Baniyas? No, from Damascus. I moved to Baniyas a year ago. We're not from Baniyas either. We were born in Damascus, but we moved to Baghdad when we were kids. My father brought us here after the American invasion. He didn't want to live in a place occupied by foreigners. - May he rest in peace. - He was right. Americans, English, French... People who worship one god alone: oil. And they are prepared to do anything for oil. - Is something wrong? - Everything's fine. You stay here, I'm getting out just for a moment. I don't like that man. I imagined. You don't like anyone. - Thanks for coming. - Stay inside! Don't thank me. If I'm here, it's just to honour the friendship I had with your father. Are you sure nobody followed you? I've been hiding for a whole day and nobody's come along. - Any arms? - No. - Not even knives? - I said no! Do you want to check? A policeman will always be a policeman, right? Shut up. Why do you want to go to Turkey? - I've got problems with a girl. - Did you get her pregnant? I never even touched her. Her father saw us in a restaurant and is convinced that I dishonoured her. Bullshit. It's all bullshit. Tell me the truth or I'll leave you here. Six months ago I met a guy I used to be friends with in school. We talked about what's going on in the country. About the demonstrations against the government. He told me about a great opportunity to make money easily. And you know how my family's doing... I told him I'd be prepared to do anything to earn some money. So that night I went to his house. There were 20 or so people. Everybody knew each other, I was the only new guy. My friend handed out sticks and guns and we went down into the street to wait for the protesters. From that day on I became a shabiha. For six months I was a shabiha. Did you kill anyone? Yes, I did. - Women too? - Maybe. Children too? Maybe. When I shot protesters, I didn't know who it'd be. I'm not helping the shabiha. Farid, if my father were alive, he'd be here begging for your help. If your father were alive, he'd have strangled you with his own hands. Three days ago the rebels found me. They wanted to execute me. I wanted to run away and save my hide. I made them an offer. My life in exchange for the addresses of my shabiha friends. I gave them their names. They found them and killed them. They kept their word with me: they freed me. But they told me to disappear and leave Syria. Farid, if you don't help me, I'll be mincemeat. Farid. Either you kill me or you help me. If I stay here, I'll be in danger. In Syria there are no longer any half measures. Okay. Get into the car. There are two women wearing niqabs. Treat them with respect and talk as little as possible. From this moment on your name will be Bilal. Bilal from Damascus. Don't be an asshole. Do you understand? Listen, I don't want you to do anything stupid or I won't hesitate to dump you on the side of the road. All right. Someone else is coming. Who's he? A friend. He'll travel with us to Turkey. This is something you didn't tell us about. I'm not obliged to tell you everything. But you're obliged not to mess us around. This man is in danger. If the army captures him, they will kill him. Do you want to have him on your conscience? You know very well what we think, we don't have to answer your question. We must be informed of any change of plan. There won't be any more surprises. You'll sleep here. Tomorrow we'll be in Turkey. - Sleep well. - You too. There are no sheets. Aren't you exaggerating? - We don't know those two men. - That's not true, we do know them. Farid is a friend of Muhammad's and is trying to help us. The other man is a rebel. His life is at risk if he stays in Syria. Why do you always believe everything? Hasn't life taught you anything? Don't you remember our escape from Baghdad? Those two men aren't our friends. Farid is helping us for money. And the other guy, Bilal, we don't know who he is or why he's wanted by the army. He could be a thief, a killer. Not trusting anyone won't make you safer, just more lonely. I'd rather be lonely than raped. Farid? Farid? What's happened? Farid. Farid! Farid, wake up! Damn keys! Good morning. What's happened? What's happened to Farid? Don't you know a dead body when you see one? I know a dead body when I see one. And a killer too! You're wrong, lady. God took his life, not me. If you don't believe me, look for yourself. There are no wounds or bruises. - Let's go into the sitting room. - Why? - We need to talk. - Talk then. Not here. Farid's here. - Afraid of a dead body? - No, I have respect for the dead. A dead man is just a dead man. He doesn't feel anything. Why were you running away? I wasn't running away. - I was simply leaving. - What's the difference? I don't have to tell you where I'm going! - Wait! - Don't touch me! Out of my way! You can't leave us here! We never made an agreement. It was Farid who was taking you to Turkey, not me. Take it out on God, not me. We're in danger just like you are! We can't stay in Syria. If I were to help all those who are at risk of getting killed, 100 years wouldn't be enough. I'm not asking you to help everyone. I'm asking you to help us! - Why should I? - Because Farid was paid to help us! I'm not Farid! Don't you understand? Farid is dead! Stop! We have the right to use the car too! Do you even have a license? Do you know how to drive? - Answer me! - No. And I bet you don't know how to drive either, do you? I do. Therefore it's mine. If you open that door, I will scream as loudly as I can! I'll let all the neighbours think that you've killed Farid! Get your things and let's go. Give me the keys. Let's leave a note for the neighbours. We'll write that Farid's dead and they will prepare him for burial. What else can we do? Aya, look what I've found! A gun... Shh! Go on... Let's go. We're ready. Let's go then. Farid had decided to travel at night. It's best we follow his plan. I don't give a damn about Farid and his plan. The keys, you wretched believer. You idiot! Don't talk to me like that! Lady, don't test my patience. The keys, come on! Why did you stop? The army controls this road. Your niqabs will cause us trouble. I know how soldiers think. Those who are religious are against the government. We won't take our niqabs off. Your stubbornness will get us killed! - Start the car and God will help us. - God, God! All evoking God. But God won't help us. - Take it off! - No! - Do as I say, or woe is us. - Why, are you going to kill us? Rape us? What will you do, Bilal? - Take it off! - Stop, you animal! - Don't you dare do that again! - Calm down. Everything's fine. Let go of me! A gun? What did you want to do? You felt powerful, huh? - Get out! - Why don't we just go? Get out immediately! Or I'll put a bullet in your head! - May God damn you! - Get out! Bastard! - Aren't you afraid of God? - Shit! - Bastard! - Shame on you! The soldiers! Hafez, is anyone there? Hafez, answer! No, sir. Let's go. What use is your driving license now? My misfortune won't help you reach the border. Give me the gun! What do you need it for? God's on your side. - Don't take His name in vain! - Shut the fuck up, stupid scumbag! Your name's not Bilal, right? Why did you lie to us? Who do you really are? Why are you running away? Will you stop it? Well, Bilal, do you want to hit a woman? Do you want to be worse than that young man in uniform? Is it because of our niqabs that you call us scumbags? Would you rather see my face before killing me? Here. Here's this scumbag's face. Happy now? Satisfied? Bilal, I don't care about who you are or what you've done. Your past belongs to you, like our faith belongs to us. The only thing I care about is staying alive. You can prevent me from dying at 20 and my husband from becoming a widower at 25! Nice speech. You're ready for parliament. But there's a weak point. What's in it for me if I help you? Money. In Turkey you'll need a lot of money. Life's tough as a refugee. Fatima, let him go. We don't need him. Well, Bilal? Let's get off the road. Now we can talk about money. First we need to talk. Let's go. Telling him that we have money. Are you nuts? If we meet anyone who wants to hurt us, who'll defend us? You? Bilal is a despicable person, but he's better than nothing. That man is one of our problems. He tried to kill us five minutes ago! - He'll run once he gets the money. - No, he won't. He can't go anywhere now that he's on foot too. How can you be so sure? All Bilal's done is lie. We can't trust him. Bilal is a coward, he will stay with us because he's frightened too. You've told him about the money already anyway. Take an ass up the minaret and you have to get him down too. Do we have another choice? Here. Don't ask for more because we don't have it. This will do. Is that so? A family could live on that money for six months! Watch it, lady. This lady has just given you a load of money. If you're waiting for me to thank you, you'll be waiting forever. No one's asking you to say thank you. Just don't pull any stunts. Stunts? You can rest assured. Our deal ends as soon as we set foot in Turkey. Let's hurry up and get there then, Bilal. Let's go. Come! - Where are you going? - It's none of your business. We paid you, everything you do is our business. I'm going to look for some water. He'll be back, you'll see. I hope so. Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Please! Please! Help me! Please! Somebody help me. Help me. Help me! Who are you? Fatima. Fatima? Let her sleep. There's no need to wake her up. The helicopters won't be able to find us. And as you see, I did not run away. If you're thirsty... ...there's a stream 100 metres away. Even if I were dying of thirst I'd never leave my sister alone with you. But your sister trusts me. She trusts that you're afraid, not honest. Now leave us alone. What are you doing? It's time to get moving. Aya. Aya, wake up. Don't worry, they're far away. - Why do you wear a niqab? - This is no time to talk about it. No? I think niqabs are... ...extremist bullshit. - But you two aren't extremists. - So what are we? Stupid. Strange, that's what our father said when we first wore it. He opposed the niqab in every way. He even grounded us for a whole month. In the end he gave up, but he was embarrassed. He's always been ashamed of us. I don't want you to talk about these things. Why not? After all, we can think of Bilal as our employee. Plus, if we answer his questions, he'll answer ours. Let's go. Enough talking. What, is your past so terrible that you can't talk about it? There's no point talking about the past now. Let's go. The soldiers! Aya, run! Run! Stop right there! If she'd been hit, we'd have found her. You know what soldiers do when they capture women? My father took us away from Iraq as soon as Aya was released. The Americans kept her prisoner for six months. She was arrested during a demonstration. They accused her of being a terrorist and of plotting attacks. As if! Her, a university student. The proof, according to them, was her niqab. In prison they tortured and raped her. That's why Aya never got married. She didn't want anyone's compassion. Not even a husband's. You know... I hope they killed her straight away. I hope she wasn't forced to relive that hell. Goodnight, Bilal. Fatima. My name is not Bilal. It's Jamil. It doesn't matter now. I'm tired. Goodnight, Jamil. Goodnight. - Quick! Hurry! - Where are we going? I don't know! - Are we lost? - Shh! Don't talk. Come on! No need for us both to risk danger. Wait here. If there's a tool shed, then there must be a farmhouse too. You wait here, I'm going to find it. Eat quickly, we have to leave. - Who gave you this stuff? - Eat and don't ask. - I'm not an idiot! - Fatima, don't push your luck. I'm warning you! Do you think I'm scared of you? I asked a question and I want an answer. The farmhouse is a ten minute walk from here. I knocked, but there was no one there. At that point I climbed in through a window and got what you see. End of story. The niqab covers my face, not my eyes. And what I see now is a liar. You can think what you like. Just as long as you shut up. A farmhouse where no one lives, but there's cheese and fresh bread. Was the fire also on, by chance, ready for our arrival? What do you want to know, the truth? Do you think knowing the truth will save your life? Stop beating round the bush and tell me what you saw. I'm not a child. Not far from the farmhouse there are some bodies. They have their hands tied behind their backs. They've been killed with a shot to the head. It's mostly one family. The soldiers will have killed them for having helped the rebels, but the opposite could also be true. The rebels don't kill innocent people. That's what you think. In a war, everyone kills everyone. That's how things work. - How many bodies? - Why is that important? It's important to me. How many? I counted six. Were they Christians or Muslims? - Why all the questions? - I want to know if you saw my sister! I don't know if Aya was there. I don't know if it was just one family or if there were prisoners too. All I know is that staying here is dangerous. Where are the bodies? - What do you want to do? - I want to find out if Aya's there. Forget it. Whoever killed them could come back at any moment. Don't worry, I'll go alone. So, where are the bodies? Follow the path. When you find the big rock on the path, go left. Enjoy your meal. Thanks, Fatima. Oh, God! May God have mercy on you. May God's mercy be upon you! May you be martyred. Thank you, God. Be quiet, sweetie. Be quiet. Kneel down. If you talk, you'll live. If you act the hero, you'll die. Fuck you! Stupid bastard. Let's go. Don't worry, I'm here with you. Jamil! Jamil? Jamil! Shh! Don't shout or they'll hear us. Who's going to hear us? They're all dead. You know very well, you bastard! Shut up! You're just a stupid woman who thinks she knows everything! Are you afraid to admit that you're a coward? - You left her there! - I didn't see her. You make me sick. In a war, those who look after themselves are the ones who survive. Altruists end up underground. I hope that sooner or later God will reward you with a bullet. Your curses do me good: they put me in a good mood. Don't listen to him, sweetie. I'm Fatima. Don't be afraid, sweetie. What's your name? Do you recognise this place? Have you been here before? I want mummy. Tell me, do you have any brothers or sisters? - Pick her up and let's go. - Not now. Cut it out and let's go. - I'm trying to build a rapport with her. - I don't give a damn. - Staying here is dangerous! - I won't go until I've reassured her. You're a stubborn, hard headed, stupid woman! Nothing is forcing you to stay. - Not even the money I gave you! - Are you playing the victim? Would you rather die like your sister? Think what you like, just as long as you leave me in peace! Where's she gone? If anything happens to her, I swear I'll kill you! Sweetie! Sweetie, where are you? Don't shout. Sweetie? Sweetie, where are you? Shh! Shut up! Little girl, sweetie, where are you? Where are you? Little girl, where are you? - Shh! - Please, answer me! - I told you not to shout! - Little girl? Incredible! That girl's family's been killed and all you can think about is yourself! People like you turned this country into a graveyard! You're the ones to blame if the good die and the killers... Shut up! I don't want to hear another word! What did you do, Jamil? Who are you really for having to run away from Syria? A soldier who betrayed the regime or a rebel who betrayed the revolution? Or are you just one of those who kill for money... With no flag? Let go of me! Let's go. You're a shabiha, right? Yes, of course you are. Why are you escaping to Turkey? They still need people like you here. They need cold-blooded people who can kill and torture others... I don't want to have anything to do with you. I'd rather continue by myself than put up with you! Get lost, immediately! Watch what you say, or you'll end up like your sister. I should be scared of you, instead I pity you. This is my revolution: not being afraid of a killer like you. Be careful! Once we're in Turkey, I'll tell everyone who you really are. No, you won't! I will! I'll have you arrested for being a shabiha! Let go of me! I bear witness that there is no God but... And that Muhammad is the messenger... Keep sleeping. Don't be afraid. Keep sleeping. Where's she gone? Hey, girl! Little girl! Where are you? Where's she gone? Are you playing games with me? Can you understand what I'm saying? Are you listening to me? Are you hungry? Are you thirsty? Are you thirsty? What do you want? Do you want to play? What can we play? Hide and seek? Get up. Come on, go hide! One. Two. Three. Four. Five, six... Open your eyes, jerk! Move! Go! Where are you from? - Idlib. But I'm from Damascus. - Are you escaping to Turkey? Yes. Why would someone who lives in Idlib come through here to go to Turkey? - My wife and my daughter were in Baniyas. - Just look at me! There's no one except you. Where's your wife? My wife died yesterday a few hours walk away from here. What about your daughter? She's hiding somewhere. When you arrived we were playing hide and seek. - Call her. - Fatima? Fatima, come out! Why isn't she listening to you? Ever since she saw her mother die, she's not spoken or eaten. The only thing she does is play hide and seek. - Find her. - Fatima? - Help him. - Fatima? Fatima? The border isn't far. We'll take you two kilometres from it, then you'll continue alone. Thank you. My wife died too. I know what it's like. A sniper took her away. A bastard like this guy. Only that he's lucky. If it had been down to me I'd have killed him right away. - Is this the place? - Yes. Go in position. You too. You go there. Your men are late. I'll wait another five minutes. I don't want to risk falling into a trap because of a bastard like you. You and the girl, over there. Get down. Do you have another cigarette? Be quiet. This is the sign. Free him. Walk slowly and don't stop. There's a woman with Khalil. - Your soldiers have tortured her! - I didn't invent the war. Fuck you! - Welcome back. - Thank you. It's been tough. Even tougher for her. May God avenge her soon. You have nothing to fear now. Come on, let's go! Hassan! - Help this woman. - I can manage on my own. I just need some water and something to cover my head. Here. Thank you. Let's go, this area is dangerous. - What's your name? - Bilal. What's yours? Rania. - Is she your daughter? - Yes. She's Fatima. Be quiet. Save your breath to walk. Move! Follow me. - I need to speak to your leader. - You can speak to him later. Now go inside. You must be hungry. I'll go get you something to eat. - But don't expect too much. - I can help you if you like. There's no need. Sit down and rest. I need to speak to your leader. He is busy right now. You'll have all the time you want later on. Where are you from? From Aleppo. What about you and your daughter? From Idlib. And where's your wife? She was killed yesterday. That's why Fatima won't talk. She's traumatized. You're lucky. We have some tea as well today. We managed to obtain it at the Turkish border. It's not great quality. But it's better than nothing. - Here. - Thanks. It's the least we can do. Here. She doesn't want to eat. Be very careful. The army is all over the place. - We will. - Always stick together. Try to... Don't worry, we'll be fine. We'll walk together until we get there, then we'll split. You keep your eyes open. We'll head for Latakia. Turkey is close. But hunger is always present. - Want some? - No. Plus, I've got a daughter to think about too. Ok, let's move. - May God protect you. - And you too. Hassan, accompany the woman and man to the border. Then come back here. We'll see each other tomorrow. God is great! Let's go. Get ready, we're going to Turkey. I need to speak to your leader first. He and the others have left. You can talk to me. - I want to do it in private. - All right. Come on. That man is a liar. I know him, that's not his daughter. - How do you know him? - He was with me and my sister. He didn't recognize me because I was wearing the niqab. - Are you sure? - Go and question him. You'll see I'm not lying. What you've told me deserves a death sentence. You look after the girl, leave the rest to me. I want to ask you a couple of questions. - Take the girl outside. - My daughter stays here. She's not your daughter! Stop pretending, Bilal! What are you talking about? Captivity plays funny tricks on you. Damn bastard, where's my sister Fatima? That's enough! Did you kill her? Rape her? - God damn you! - I said enough! I'll deal with him! Take the girl and go out. What do you want to know? Don't be afraid. Get out of my face! Come lie next to me. Hey, little girl! Where are you, sweetie? Hey, girl! Sweetie! Where are you? Little girl! Where are you, sweetie? Where are you, girl? Sweetie! Where are you? Sweetie! Where are you? Sweetie! Sweetie! Where are you? Sweetie!
