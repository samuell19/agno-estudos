Sometimes tyres just blow. - Tyres don't just blow. - Does it need a reason to blow? - Everything happens for a reason. Something must have caused it. - Says who? - Says me! - All right, God did it. Satisfied? - No. - You wanted an answer. - That's no kind of answer. - Well it keeps two billion Christians sleeping at night. - Okay, so why did the big man blow out our tyre? - Haven't you heard? He holds a grudge. You know, you could've helped me. - You never asked. - Well I'm askin' now. - Well I am helping. - How so? - Well, I'm your motivation. - Uh-huh. Well consider me motivated.

(ominous music) It's just a motorbike. - [Woman] Is it? - What's the difference between a motorcyclist and a cock? None. Both brainless pieces of meat with helmets on top. - I think he's following us. - Who? - That creep from the petrol station. - You're being paranoid. - Yeah, but that doesn't mean I'm not right, does it?

It's just I get carsick. - Yeah, that's fine. Um, he doesn't speak English. - Oh, sorry! (speaking in foreign language) - Thank you. I'll just get rid of these. Thank you. - [Driver] Yeah, sure! - Thank you so much for picking us up. You have no idea the difference you've made. - Aw, I'm happy to help. - It's a big, big help. - You might've seen our car a while back. - Yeah, we did see a car. (speaking in foreign language) Did you break down? - It proved unreliable. - A rental? - I borrowed. - So, what are your names? I'm Alva. - Alva? That's pretty. - Brit's always have such boring names. - I'm sure your names aren't dull. If we all know each other, we can be friends, right? - Simple as that, is it? - Yeah, of course. - Know the name, know the person. - Well you can tell a lot from a person's name. Do you know what Alva means? - Beautiful. - It means elf. - Ha, it's fitting. (laughs) - Michael, stop teasing. - Oh, Michael. That is a nice name. It's not boring. - So what does Michael mean? - I have no idea. (laughs) - I'm Becca. - So now you think you know us? - Yeah. - And now we're all friends. - This is Freyr. - Oh. - So what's your story? - My story? - Yeah. You and Freyr here. Since we're all sharing. - Oh, well, I spend half my time here and half my time in a small village in Sweden. That's why I speak the language somewhat, but I butcher the accent. Uh, Freyr and I met at school in Sweden. - Oh. School sweethearts? - Yeah, you could say that. - She did say that. - [Becca] I think it's a sweet story. - We were each other's first kiss. - How romantic. - So are you from near here? - No. - Oh, are you on holiday? - Uh, more of a getaway. - Oh. Well you know all about us two. What about you? - What do you wanna know? - Anything, doesn't matter. - Well if it doesn't matter, then why do you wanna know? So, Freyr. How you guys going, then? - He doesn't speak English. - Oh, just checkin'. So where are you guys going? - Home. Where do you two want dropping off? - We'll let you know. - Do you have a place to stay? - We'll find somewhere. - There's nowhere around here. - Ah, we'll find somewhere. - Are you guys lost or something? - Something. - Yeah, I mean do you know where you are? - We're with you. - Okay, well, just let me know where you want me to drop you off, yeah? (singing in foreign language) (ominous music) Yeah, just let me know where you want me to drop you off. - Nice car. - Thank you. - Thank you. (ominous music) (navigation speaking in foreign language) What did that say? - We're almost home. - Oh, well, you'll be wanting to get rid of us, then. (laughs) - What's it like living out here? No one around to disturb you? - Yeah, they don't. - Alva, do you love Freyr? - Yeah, why do you ask? - And does he love you? - I, I think I'm just gonna drop you both here if that's okay. - You stop this car and I'll put your head through the windscreen. See how much he loves you with holes where your eyes used to be. Really doesn't speak English, does he? - No. - Wait, you can't answer me? - No, no, he doesn't speak English. - Great. Great, well then we can just keep pretending like everything all well and good. You know, like friends. Alva, but do you trust us? - You can be honest. - No, I, I don't trust you. - So you can trust us not to be trustworthy. - And if you don't know what we're likely to do, then you're likely to do what we say. (ominous music) (speaking in foreign language) - What'd he say? - Um, he asked if I'm okay. - I thought you said he didn't understand English. - Well he's Swedish, he's not stupid, he knows when something's not right. - [Michael] So make it right. (speaking in foreign language) - What did you tell him? - I just said that you're mad at each other for getting lost. - That was good. - What do you want from us? - We don't want anything from you, we just want your car. But then what do you suggest we do with you? - Well just, just take the car and leave us here. (scoffs) - We're English, not stupid. Just keep driving for now. (ominous music) Pull in here. Turn the engine off, and take the keys out of the ignition. Go look at me and smile. Thank you for the lift. You ready, baby? - Yeah. (yelling) - Please, please! - [Freyr] Alva! Please, please just take the car, please just take the car! Why are you doing this to us? - There's no reason. It's just fun, innit? (thudding) - No, please! (ominous music) - No you don't! - That's great work, baby. Hey? (ominous music) (sobbing) - I never really liked blond guys. Alva tuh, Alva tuh, I'm not even gonna bother saying that, but she was 27. I thought she was 12. Oh my god! They were only one stamp off a whole chicken. (laughs) Shame. I think they look better on me, anyway. What do you think? - Very nice. - You're not even looking! - Well give us a twirl, then. Yeah. Very you. You ready? - We have to go right now? Come on, it's a nice night. Let's stay for a bit. Do you remember when you got me this? - I forget. - She was my first. And you said, "Beautiful things belong together." - I said that? - (laughs) Yeah. And then you cut it off her neck and you gave it to me. - Well don't say I never give you anything. (laughs) (sighs) Oh, I'm starving! I wonder if they've got any food in. (ominous music) (breathing heavily) - (sighs) Can you watch, please? - It's not my thing. - I don't mean that! Keep a look out! Scary out here. - There's no one around. - We're around! (dramatic music) We set? - Once I set this thing to English and find out where we're going, we are set. - [Navigation] In 400 feet, - There we go. - continue straight.
