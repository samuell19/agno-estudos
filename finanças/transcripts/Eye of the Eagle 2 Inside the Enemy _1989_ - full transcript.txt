Volunteering to stay behind so that valuable prisoners could be evacuated to the rear in your place. Where do you want me to? - Lean into him, there. - Oh sir, I'm not sure if you're aware of this but my squad didn't volunteer to stay on the ground. I mean I didn't volunteer -- - Sure you did, it's all in Major Sorenson's report. - Yeah but I'm, I'm not sure what he put in the report but I didn't volunteer to stay on the ground. - Listen Private we're gonna give you the Star.

(phone ringing) I'm going to lunch now, could you take care of this while I'm gone. Glenn good to see you again, what can I do for you? - Well I just wanted to thank you for recommending me for the Silver Star sir. - Well I am going to lunch, care to join me, we can talk over lunch. - Yes sir. (synthesized piano music) - I gotta tell you that what you did out there in the bush with no experience is amazing. That's instinct, what do you think? - It's nice. - You earned this. The best army takes care of its heroes. We're winning. - Thank you. I just wanted to thank you Major 'cause er, sir, you know for everything that you've done for me and for this, lunch. There's still on question I was just wondering, I don't recall any of us ever volunteering to stay on the ground and -- - No. - No, and I was wondering if maybe there was a way you could check, I was wondering if there was a way that you could check into that. - I'm sorry just (speaking foreign language) I've got some business to take care of here, I'll be back in a minute. Go ahead huh, have some more cognac, it's okay. (fan whirring) (speaking foreign language) (whistles) - Come on. (car engine rumbling) Alright my friend you wait here for me right.

Those are our orders. - Alright hang on. Okay just stay here okay, alright. (typewriter keys clacking) - Good to see you again Glenn. Sit down. Sit down. Oh want a drink? It was kind of disappointing what you did, all that good cognac, nice lunch, not a word, just took off. Shit. You know we're not all that different really, we think we are. I remember when I was a kid, not too much younger then your age now. Got stuck on an L train one night between stations, Chicago I think and there was this vacant lot down below. There was a gang fight going on in there, like dogs. Guys tryna kill each other. I noticed about my level, lookin' down both sides were the leaders, shouting orders this way and that way. And not necessarily the meanest or the toughest, but they were survivors. Even 54, I was assigned security, some special delegation secret, to try to end the French Indochina war. I thought Comi were the bad guys, aint no difference. Survivors, your squad, that squad expendable, thought you were all dead. Five or six days later you come out of there, no support, no fire power to speak of, you walk out of there with a local. Survivor, it's fascinating. - Why didn't you tell the truth, you know about my squad staying on the ground? - The truth, fable agreed upon truth. The only truth, the only reality is survival. That's all. Survivors, leaders and the world belongs to us. It is, it's just there, it's ours. - Silver Star. - Silver Stars, yep everything, all of it. - You're sick. You're sick. Did you enjoy it? God damn, you, you touched her didn't you. Yeah and you hit her didn't yah. You like to hit women don't yah, makes you feel real powerful doesn't it? God. Just, no no no, uh uh. - Finished? - Is that all sir? - No, no your medical leaves been suspended. As of now you've got a new assignment. Fire Base, Little Alamo. Your little friend Mai, we have solid intelligence that she's a spy, Hanoi spy. The report you gave this office has been destroyed for reasons of national security. All persons involved in that report have been transferred out of this theater of operations. You fuck with my again I'll kill you personally. That's all. You really are a fucking fool. (dramatic music) (upbeat synthesized music) (baby crying) (gun firing) (loud thud) (rapid gunfire) (gentle synthesized music) (speaking foreign language) - Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. (water splashing) - This just came in sir, it's got priority from the main man. - Glenn? - Yes. - Oh man this man has got the whole damn army on his arse and I gave him the Silver Star. Okay we'll alert our fellas to do the same thing as everybody else, if you see him, nail him. I don't care how you do it, just, nail him, damn. (birds chirping) (suspenseful synthesized music) (bombs exploding) (helicopter whirring) - Corporal Ronaldo. Hi I'm Major Sorenson, Saigon. I understand you got the tags for a KIA Glenn, 1st and 7th. - That's right. - Tell me about it. - We were tracking a couple of VC scouts about four clicks north of here. There was this big explosion, we popped him, when we reconned the area we found the two bodies, his and a VC girl. - Where are the bodies? - There's your body. - You're sure it was Glenn? - That's what the dog tags say. - You telling me you never saw him before? - That's right. - That's bull shit, don't bull shit me. On my desk in Saigon little report about a sapper incident on Tu Do Street a few months back, two military personnel, a private Glenn and a LRRP Corporal by the name of Ronaldo. Now that wouldn't be you by any chance would it? You have any idea what the penalty is for abetting a deserter? A VC collaborator at that. - I don't know what you talking about. You on the wrong turf, I told you he was KIA. - You don't know what you just did do you. You don't know, you are one dead nigger. - Don't mean nothing, I've been dead a while but Glenn's gone, he's on his way back to the world and when he makes it that's gonna be your arse Major. You can take that from one dead man to another. (suspenseful synthesized music) (helicopter whirring) (truck rattling) (speaking foreign language) (knocking on window) - I am sorry we do not open until this evening. - That's okay we're not here for drinks. Listen we need to arrange some kind of passage. - Then go to the steam ship office. - Listen wait, got American dollars. - I can arrange a Canadian passport for you in another name. Since you insist on taking the girl with you it is better for her to go as your wife. - Okay sure. - A small freighter is best, I suggest a Philippino captain I deal with on occasion. The price is 10,000 American dollars for you both. - Okay. - Up front. - Alright. - There is a freighter headed for Vancouver tomorrow, you will need photos. So go to this address, ask for Dr. Popoy. - Dr. Popoy. - Popoy - Popoy, he's also a Philippino. Be back here tomorrow morning at 10. (speaking foreign language) - Um excuse me are you Dr. Popoy? (speaking foreign language) - What can I do for you? - Um, well Michelle Leclerc said that you could take some photos for us. - This way please. - Your wife is very attractive, perhaps you'd like to earn some extra money working for me? - I don't think so, I don't think so. (speaking foreign language) I don't think so. - Oh the pictures will be ready tomorrow then. - Thank you, come on. - Operator I'd like to place a call to Saigon, Lepolas, person to person, Mr Vang Pao. - What's wrong? - Man say wife. - Oh, um, it's for the passport. You know, so it's easier if we're man and wife but we're not, we're not really man and wife okay. - Wife. - No. No, we're just playing. (mournful music) This means a lot to me. Would you be my wife? - Morning, morning, morning. Sir, phone call, Saigon. - Sorenson, yeah. Where? Leave them go, we've found our boy. - It is the SS Santiago out of Manila. Passage for both of you has been arranged, it leaves at 12 noon, that gives you less that one hour, dock nine. (jeep engine rumbling) (brakes squealing) As soon as you're on the boat you're on Philippino soil. (knocking on door) We are closed. - US Army Intelligence, open up. - Just a minute, just a minute. Is this something to do with you? - Yeah. - You're making my life very interesting, stay in here, keep the door shut. (knocking on door) Okay, just a minute. - Open this door now, now motherfucker. Where the fuck are they? - What is the meaning of this? - Where the fuck are they? - What do you mean where the fuck are they? - Cut the shit frog, I know about the passports. - What concern is that of yours? (rapid gunfire) (tires squealing) (car horns blaring) (brakes squealing) - Shit. Come on. (car horn blaring) (rapid gunfire) Shit! (brakes squealing) You okay? (gun firing) (bomb exploding) (rapid gunfire) (gun firing) (man yelling in pain) (bomb exploding) - Come on let's go. - What the hell's going on in here. I'm a Major, S2 intelligence, there's a VC, VC collaborator, they're getting away, go. - I need to see some ID sir. - I am a fucking intelligence officer! Go! (ships horn blaring) Get on the radio, have anybody stop that boat. - Out of my jurisdiction sir. - Do what I tell you to do, get on the radio and stop the boat. - I don't have the authorization to permit that sir. (gentle synthesized music)
