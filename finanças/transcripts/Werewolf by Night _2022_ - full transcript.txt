The known universe, with its heroes and marvels, but what of the darkness? In our modern world, this is where monsters dwell, alongside those who hunt and slaughter them with pride. None more prolific than the Bloodstone family, whose patriarch has long controlled the powerful supernatural relic, the Bloodstone, a weapon unlike any other. But now, this weapon is in want of a new master, for Ulysses Bloodstone has died. Tonight is his funeral. Hunters have gathered from around the globe, strangers until this night, for a ceremonial hunt which will decide who next will wield the Bloodstone. And woe to the monster who finds itself among them. Elsa's here. It's a beauty, innit? Fifty-seven confirmed kills myself. Next year's my 30th season. I can almost smell the blood on your hands. Thank you. I like your whole look here with the makeup. It's a killer trademark. Yeah. It's to honor my ancestors. Yeah. Not much for honoring ancestors and feelings and all that. I just know it looks brilliant on you. I mean, I understand the importance of anonymity in our line of work, but it gets lonely. Just want to say I'm proud to be honoring old Ulysses with you here tonight. Ulysses. Of course. Hard to believe he's gone. Aye, the mad bastard. Quite a place he built for himself here, eh? So, any of these hacked beasties your handiwork? No. No, but... But him. Him, I fought a few times. He's never looked so alive. Elsa, after 20 years, I hope you didn't feel obligated to come. God knows the others won't like it. How long can we expect you to stay? Give me what's mine, I'll leave now. What aspect of Bloodstone are we after exactly? The strength it lends, the protection? Longevity... Verussa, what I do with it after I've earned it will be none of your business. To be honest, that might be the best part. I wonder if you're up to it. All these years without training... Without his training. Let's find out together. Hmm... You were so promising growing up. We all believed you would surpass your father. Instead, you seem satisfied to emulate your mother. I did what I could with you. Shame I didn't turn out. Don't be too easy on yourself. You were the greatest disappointment of his life. Over 200 kills, collectively. Twenty-six for you. Thirty-seven kills. Forty-three. An impressive 57. And over 100 deaths, give or take. Over 100? Yeah. So many death dealers in one room. Oh, my dear heart! Thank you for gathering in ritual, for shedding your masks tonight in honor of Ulysses Bloodstone. He was a leader, a friend, a lover without equal. Knowing his spirit would not be with us tonight to state his wishes for the ceremonial hunt, he orchestrated his presence in other ways. Incorrigible, really. I do hope my attendance delights you. Thank you, Verussa, for seeing it through and for shaping our cause like no other. Oh! With my passing, it is now time to choose a new leader in the crusade against monsters. This honor can only be bestowed upon the strongest and most committed to our mission. Very soon, a monster unlike anything you've faced will be released into these sacred grounds. The hunter who slays this beast will become our new leader, taking possession of my Bloodstone. Good luck. I'll be rotting for you. Oh, forgive me. Graveyard humor. There is only one Bloodstone, and it can have only one keeper. It was to be his daughter's, but through decades of absence, Elsa has long forsaken that birthright. The only weapons permitted tonight have been placed throughout the garden for you to find. Per my husband's wishes, the stone will be affixed to the monster's hide. This will weaken it. It will also make it angry. Hang on. The stone's finally up for grabs and we all earned the right to hunt, but she gets to crash this thing like it's a backyard wedding? He brings up a good point. Where's the lovely lady's medallion? Have you checked up your own arse? Elsa is welcome to join. And like the rest of you, she's fair game. No special treatment. Those who do not survive will be honored appropriately. For tonight, it is every hunter for themselves. Ya lucky bastard. You shall go first. The others will follow. Right there, come on. Put her out, put her out! - Let's move. - Close the gates. I'd say the stone was in place. Off you go. And now, we pledge. We spill all blood for the hunt. For stone and creed, for those who forged our blade. To rid this land of its abominations. There is no peace without blood, and so it shall be. And so it shall be. And so it shall be. And so it shall be. And so it shall be. And so it shall be. I suggest we just pass each other by. What? I suggest we just pass each other by. The stone is mine! Death is coming for you, lassie! Hey. Hey. What's up? Well, of course I was gonna come find you. Of course. Are you okay? You keep saying that you're gonna be careful each time, and here we go again. You can't keep counting on me to save you. This is the last time. I know. Does it hurt? It's weakening you, right? Yeah, they said that the stone would do that. Don't worry, I have a plan. Look, so apparently, these little things explode. So, we're gonna explode our way out of here. All you have to do is don't die. Don't... Just keep alive. I'm gonna figure out where to put this, and I'll come get you. I'll find you. I don't know. No, no, no, don't close the... Door. Well, that's great. How's your night going? Well, it's going. Difficult. You hurt? - Can I help you? - No. Okay. But it's bleeding a lot. It has to be tight and even. Wow, thank you for that. Me, I have to get out of here. Oh, and you think I don't? I came to get the stone 'cause I want to be rid of my dad, my stepmother, all of this for good. Now, I'm stuck in here with some... Oh, that's tight. Can I take a look? It has to be done right, because if not, it's not gonna work. You didn't want to fight before either, did you, running into me? Then that maniac with the axe, hell, you didn't fight. I'm having a hard time believing you hunted and killed monsters. Well, I'm not that type of hunter. At least not like those esbirros out there. Yeah, well, neither am I. No? It's not in your DNA then? If you're not a hunter, why do you want the stone? I don't. That's not the reason why I'm here. You know, maybe we can help each other. If you help me get the monster out of here alive, I can get you the stone. Right, yeah. 'Cause you'll just have a quick chat with him, sort it out 'cause you're, what, the monster's friend? So, you don't wanna be like your father, then? Careful. I understand. It must be complicated to grow up with this family. You have no idea about my family, none. I don't. I can tell you my family was different. But all families have something in common. They follow us. For good, for bad. They stay, like they become an atmosphere. And sometimes, we think that by doing something very specific, we can change everything, and not be like them. Or sometimes, they're just a pain in the ass that we have to save all the time. I don't know. It's complicated. We could die here. You and I, with your family. It's an option. It's not my choice, but it's an option. What are you doing? When I was a kid, my dad used to tell me stories about my crazy Aunt Frances. He said that if I misbehaved, she would unlock her tomb and come out and pull me back in there with her for company. She was positive that she'd come back from the dead at some point, and she knew that when she did, she'd need... That's not bad. Ooh! ...an exit strategy. Well done, Elsa. My name is Jack, by the way. Okay, Jack, you blow the wall, I'll get him to you. Okay, I trust you. I'm trusting you, okay? Just get me the stone and we're good. Then you're on your own. Okay. Closest perimeter wall is that way, straight shot, then two lefts and a right. There's a massive crack about halfway down. As soon as you get there, turn on the explosive. Throw it at the wall, then get clear. Okay. And, Jack, cross me and I'll kill you both. Okay. Hey, when you run into him, just... Just treat him like an old friend. Call him by his name. Which is? Ted. He's called Ted. Ted? Yeah. How do you turn this on? Because I've been trying... No. Hey! Ted? You have a lovely name. And your friend is waiting for you. No! Wait! Well, now, look at this. The Bloodstone did this to you? He grabbed it and it threw him back. My word. A monster. Masquerading as one of our own. Desecrating a sacred night. And you? What was the thinking here? You freed a monster with a monster? I didn't know that bit. Well, I can't wait to find out what breed of evil you are. None of you should have the stone. The hunt decides! House rules. No. No, no, no, no... No. Elsa? Elsa. Are you okay? Until you rip my throat out, I suppose I'm fine. I... am sorry. I couldn't tell you, you know. It wasn't safe. What, did you think it might cloud my judgment a bit? Yeah, I know, I'm an idiot. I know. But I'm also a human. Perhaps not in the category that you would call a human a human. You see, I've got systems to manage the hurt I could cause... I don't care about your systems. Just stay away from me until you can't. But they work. You'd be surprised. They actually work. 'Cause I'm not like that. I'm like this, you know. I'm... I would never hurt you or hurt any one of them. And any hunting that I do is done by a part of me that is not me. And that's not the part you're with right now. So you got nothing to worry about. Because I lock myself in once a month, every full moon. That's it. And the next full moon is in five days. We have plenty of time to figure something out. You don't get it, mate. Why do you think they put me in here with you? Five days? The Bloodstone's capable of transforming you in five seconds. Thanks in advance for making it quick. No, no. I shouldn't have asked for your help. Yeah, well, I shouldn't have needed yours. - This is gonna be really bad. - Bloody stupid. Okay, okay. So, if this is gonna happen, I need you to look at me. Okay? Do not break eye contact, no matter what. What are you talking about? What are you doing? What the... Get... And this is what? I need to remember you. Well, does it work? Once... I'm asking you, please. Please don't do this. Not this way. Just kill me as I am. Otherwise there will be no mercy, I promise. Mercy? This may surprise you, our whole mission is built on mercy for you, and those like you, as well as all the innocent lives you take. You'll wanna see this, darling. Your father died convinced you'd never come home. I lived in hope. I wonder how he'd feel about you hunting me. Better than he'd feel about your betrayal. But once this is over, you'll notice my hands are clean. His? Mmm, not so much. It's time for you to show yourself. I'm sorry, Elsa. My hand! He won't let go! He won't let go! He's pulling me in! Get him! No! No, no, no! Jack, you still in there? Elsa! You let him go! You will now die, as you lived, a disgrace to your father's memory, and the hallowed Bloodstone name! He went that way. There you are, mistress. I only wanted to make myself available to you. Brilliant. You can start clearing all this shit up. Oh, yeah, thanks, Ted. Thanks, man. Is she okay? Good. That's good. What? No. No, I'm the one who comes to your rescue. What are you talkin' about? Whatever. No. Man, I cannot think of food right now. I'm... Let's do sushi. I owe you that. Yes. Yeah, you choose. Yeah.
