[applause] ANNOUNCER: That was a clear shot. Yes, it's such a clever play of Brian Lowry. He threatens to come forward here, and he's so quick to rock back. We've got a challenge for him. [engine starting] [dog barking] [heavy breathing] [grunting] [buzzer] Come on. Come on. [heavy breathing] Come on. Ollie? Christ. Hello there. Hello. So, what's been happening to you? Well, he's been in a lot of pain. I gave him 10 milligrams of Junifen. I'm Martyn Wyatt. I'm one of the GPs at the west side. Is he a patient? No, he's my son. Oliver. Did he lose consciousness? I don't think so. We'll do some x-rays, eh? WOMAN ON PHONE: Hello? It's me. WOMAN ON PHONE: Is he with you? Yes. WOMAN ON PHONE: Jesus, where the hell are you? I've been calling around half the nei-- You've been engaged. We're at the hospital. Some kids roughed him up in the common. WOMAN ON PHONE: Oh my god. Is he hurt? Is he all right? He's all right. His face is a bit of a mess. Looks worse than it is. WOMAN ON PHONE: I'll be right over. No, no, no. It's all right. They're just checking him over. Then I'll bring him home. All right? - How many? - One. You're sure? Mm. - Two. - One. Two. One. Two. One. What do you think, Tom? I don't know. He might live. Yeah? I think so. Ollie, these kids on the common-- did-- did you know them? Were they from school? The same ones as before? It's Mom. Oh, sweetheart. You OK? Does it hurt? Oh, darling. You know, we were so worried. What were you doing out? We were about to call the police. Vince and Jamie. Vince and Jamie? But why? You know, when I left you were doing your homework. You just can't go out at night like that. You left him alone? No, of course not. Frank was there. He said one minute you were there, and the next you'd gone. Hi. Hi. This-- this is my-- this is, uh-- Oliver's mother. X-rays are fine. As far as I can tell, it's all superficial. Just keep an eye on him. Usual precautions. Great. You did good. Come on. Let's go. Let's go. Those patient files I have lost night? MAN: Whole table. How far would you say it is to the common from Hannah's house? 200 yards? Three? Maybe he thought he'd get in trouble if he went home. You know, if he'd slipped out without asking permission. Oh, come on. You're his dad. It's only natural he should come to you. Hey. So, how are you, Tom? Are you OK? Yes, I am, thank you. Yes. Sorry. Right. See you later. I'm back. How's Ollie? He's fine. He's had some breakfast, and dozed off again. I don't want to go into work. Do you think I should call them and say-- No. You go in, and I'll take [inaudible] after him if he's getting better, all right? OK. All right. I'll be back by seven. All right. [dog barking] Oh, hello. Oh, hi. Are you Jamie Hunt's mother? Yeah. I'm Martyn Wyatt, Oliver's father. From across the way. Um-- he got in some trouble on his way home last night, and I was wondering, if he comes over again, could you call one of us, so we can see he gets home OK? Well, yes, of course. But he wasn't here last night. We haven't seen him for ages. Not since he started that new school. Sorry. [applause on television] Ollie? Ollie? Oliver? Oliver? Oliver? What are you doing? Hey, I don't suppose you'd fancy stopping off somewhere, eh? Get some ice cream. Thanks. I was always wanting my dad to take me to work with him when I was a kid. He was a salesman. Always off on their own somewhere. My mother wouldn't hear of that. Well, you know moms. Fuss, fuss, fuss, eh? Oh, Ollie. [shouting] Oliver, put those on. You see? You're that one cool dude, Ollie. Yeah, go on. She's yours. Boys? This is Oliver. Oliver, this is the boys. Blimey. What happened to the other bloke, then, eh? Inspector's been over. Got a snag list as long as your arm. Shit. Listen, Ollie, it's gonna take some time, so why don't you run over there and have a play? And if anyone asks, Ollie, you're with me, right? What's up? Yeah, then. Yeah. Come on, fellows. 1, 2, 3. [whispering] Mom? Honestly. As if I haven't seen it a hundred times before. Out you get. So, did you have good day with Frank? Can I go to school tomorrow? Are you up to it, hey? What about these bruises? It's fine. Listen, my love, your father came to see me today. And he said he didn't go and see Jamie last night. Hm? What were you doing, eh? Where were you? Was it that you were out on your bike again? Was it? Darling, you mustn't do it. Honestly. You know, if you do it one more time, that bike will have to go. I'm not kidding. Listen, terrible things can happen to a child. Things that you can't even-- you know, when you go running to your dad like that, it's as if you don't trust me. Hm? I'm sorry. Darling. Just don't do it again, OK? [children shouting] Yeah. You're telling me-- [children shouting] [children singing] (SINGING) All day long I hear you-- Calling out that he's been framed. Yeah. I see my light come shining from the west, out to the east. Any day, now-- any day, now, I shall be released. I'll see you when you do. All right. Bye, then. Bye. See you later. Oh, god. Sorry, Tom. Oh, what? What, what, what? What is it this time? Who died? Which member of the family dead? We all dead? Your whole family's dead? Everybody's dead? Get a watch. Yeah, get a life. [laughter] [phone ringing] Hannah Wyatt. MAN ON PHONE: It's me. Uh, he was out on his bike, and some kids tried to steal it. What was all that stuff about Jamie? Oh, he's not allowed out on his bike after dark, and he knows it. It's really not that complicated. Can I talk to him? He's back at school. No? Just-- get off my back. Right. How are you? Your eye looks much better. I thought I'd give you a lift home. Great. Yeah. Yeah? All right. MALE SPEAKER (VOICEOVER): If they fail, if they die, the galaxy will come permanently under the yoke of the empire. [star wars theme] [oliver humming] Star Wars, episode 10. Wow, that one's brilliant. You know, this thing, Ollie, about going out on your bike-- You know you never have to lie to me? You can tell me anything. You do know that? I'd better get back now. [dog barking] [car horn] [inaudible]? Ah! [laughter] Hey, don't forget to do your chores. Now we've got a bit of a minervois here, which is actually meant to be eaten with, uh, stews and casseroles, but I think we're probably all right. - You're all right with that? Yeah. I think-- scrape it first. Have those knives around the right way. Rubbish, then you're done. [laughter] [music playing] You should try and get some sleep, eh? You've got work in the morning. Kids lie, don't they? Yeah, 90% of the time. But I've stopped now. Honest. Look, it's just a phase. All kids have secrets. It's no big deal. Martyn-- [moaning] [moaning] [laughter] You keep on pushing it, don't you, Ollie? Hm? You know the rules. On your mark. There's a right way, and a wrong way of doing everything. Here, Ollie. If you drink from the carton, you're going to spread germs, Ollie. Sorry. It's all right. It's always the same with you, though, isn't it, Ollie, eh? I'm sorry? You bring it on yourself, Ollie. You really do. [clattering] Ollie! Come here! Here! I go out of my way-- out of my way to do right by you, don't I? Don't I? Now, all I ask in return is that you behave like a civilized human being, and you follow a few ground rules. Now, is that too much to ask? is it? - I'm sorry. - Say it, Ollie. Come on! Say it. What must you learn? What? To control-- exceptions. Excesses, Ollie. excesses. Excessive. Of my nature. And behave. Good boy, Ollie. OK. Again. I must learn to control-- [doorbell] Stay there. Sorry to disturb you. I'm part of a scheme for the unemployed, to help ourselves, and I was wondering if you wanted to buy-- Piss off. Wanker. Ollie? Ollie? Ollie? Hello! Something smells good. I curried. That thing from last night. You and your curries. Where's Oliver? Upstairs. Ah! Love me? Sound asleep. Yes, he turned up for his operation at nine yesterday morning, as requested, and got sent home again. Don't put me on ho-- sorry. [buzzer] Yep? WOMAN: A Mr. Bugler on line two, doctor. From your son's school. In your English Treasury, page 43. Page 43. I'm Dr. Wyatt, Ollie's father. He's got a very nasty hand. Has he? Well-- Ah. Dr. Wyatt. What happened? Well, it didn't happen here. His classmates say he came to school with it this morning. Can you give us a minute? Certainly. Let's have a look, hm? Can you squeeze my finger? [gasping] What's going on, Ollie? Tell me son, please. Whatever it is. Nothing will happen to you. I promise. No one will hurt you. Are you frightened? You mustn't be frightened. Shut it in the car door. Mom's car? Whose car? Frank's? The old car. The old car on the common. [MUSIC - BOB DYLAN, "THE MIGHTY QUINN"] (SINGING) Hey, everybody sitting around 'neath the tree. When Quinn the Eskimo gets here, all the pigeons gonna go to him. Come on without. Oh, come on within. We'll not-- [phone ringing] [humming] Yep? WOMAN ON PHONE: I wanted to speak to Martyn. He's at work. WOMAN ON PHONE: Well, where's Oliver? Isn't he with you? I just rang the school. Apparently Martyn picked him up. Please tell him he is outside his access agreement, and I want Oliver home now. What are you thinking? I have to be sure. It couldn't have been a car door, could it? Yeah, I don't think so. Fractures are at different levels, and the skin isn't broken. Another child couldn't have done it? Not without a weapon. Or a brick. No, I think the hand's been crushed. And whoever did it is pretty strong. Right. Hello there, Ollie. Well, what have even up to today? Hitting the walls again? I've been trying to page you. Hannah called. Yeah, she was concerned about this chap's whereabouts. Been here, haven't you? Hello, Martyn. Can you spare a minute? Well, I was just going to-- Just a minute, please? It's this guy my wife's living with. I don't know why I didn't think of it before. Well, you you prove it? I've got the x-rays, and a medical report. And his hand was crushed. Three bones broken. That doesn't mean that your wife's, uh-- what's he called? - Donally. Frank Donally. Yeah, that Donally did this. It's him, Roy. Well, what about Oliver? Can he confirm this? He's too terrified to say anything. What about your wife? She don't know about him. Then you have no witnesses. What do you want me to do? I want you to get him out of that house. Tonight. That's just not possible. We need an injunction. There's no judge that's going to give me that without any proof. I've already spoken to the police. Well, then, they'll investigate it. But not tonight? I'm not taking him back there, Roy. You may have to, if you want to stay within the law. He's being beaten! Your wife has custody? Yes. Well, then, we can make an urgent appeal to have the terms of that reconsidered. There may be something there. But it's going to take a week. At least. Now, remind me, the access agreement's what? Reasonable access. No overnight stays. Then you'll have to stick to it. You breach the present order, your wife will throw the book at you. So will the judge. And don't talk to Oliver about this. The court will say that you've been pressurizing him. Leading him into it. And for the moment, say nothing to your wife. This Donally fellow-- who is he? Was he married? Has he got kids? I don't know. He's-- he's single. He-- spent some time in Saudi working. That's all I know. It's OK, Dad. Honest. Ollie. Call us. Any time. Go on. Fuck this. Did he tell you the latest? Crap about shutting his hand in a car door. Let's go inside, Oliver. Where are you going? Hannah! Don't walk away. Hannah! So, what happened? Ask Frank. What? We've been swallowing all this crap. Kids in the common going at him, his bike-- it's been happening here, Hannah. Right here, in this house. He did it! HANNAH: You are mad. You are completely-- He broke his fucking hand, Hannah. He crushed it! Oh, he said he did? Did Oliver say it? Oliver's terrified! And look at him. He's your son. Oh, god. Don't-- no, don't tell me how to look after my own son. I don't know what that animal does for you, but either he gets out of this house, or I'm going for custody! You'll never get him away from me. Who would listen to you? No one's going to take away my son and hand him over to a couple of faggots. Oh, beautiful. Sweet. You're jealous. That's what it is. You're jealous of Fred because he's normal, and he's decent, and he just wants Oliver to be the same. By beating him to a pulp? Every time he has been hurt, he has been with you. Do you think that hasn't crossed my mind? And I'll say that. I will say it-- You know me better than that. I don't know you. I have no idea who you are. Get out. Get out of my house! I've spoken with the police. I mean, it's unbelievable. I mean, out of the blue he's decided to go for custody. You know, suppose he has gone to the police, or-- I think that him and Tom have just cooked this up, and-- they want to-- You know every single time-- every single time he-- He must know who these kids are. I mean, I just wish he'd talk to me. It's just that-- I just don't know what's going. We've got to go to the police, because-- - Hannah. - What if he does say these-- Hannah. Hannah, you're forgetting something. You're forgetting something. You're forgetting who he is. OK? I mean, he's hysterical. He's just a jealous little queen. I mean, let him say what he likes. Who's gonna believe him, eh? [radio chatter] HANNAH: That's really stupid, but I promise you I didn't know. Well, because he was-- Well, did Oliver take one? I can't seem to get him to talk about it. Yes. Martyn made a point of telling him so. He was the one that had been rejected. Ollie? Ollie, darling, Sgt. Curtis has come to have a little chat with us. Hello, Oliver. Why don't you go up to your room? Um-- why don't you show her your fish? OK? [chopping] Hi. There's someone from the child protection bureau upstairs with Oliver. SGT. CURTIS: OK, Oliver. Bye. Nice to have met you. So, this is Frank. Frank, this is Sgt. Curtis. - Ah, yes. [inaudible] You managed to have a talk with Oliver, then? We had a little chat, yeah. Good. I-- I mean, if there's anything we can do, you let us know. I mean, come to see you. Whatever. Thanks, Mr. Donally. Thanks for the tea, Mrs. Wyatt. My pleasure. Um, so, what happens now? Well, we'll have to talk to all of the parties. Go by Oliver's school. Set up a case meeting. - OK. - We'll be in touch. - Thank you. OK. Yeah. We'll catch you later, the. - Yeah. Give us a call. Yeah? Soon. - Yeah. Will do. The child protection people came today. I may have to prove my fitness as a father, Tom. If I'm seen to be living clean and monklike, it might just help sway things. So? You want me to move out? Just until the hearing. After that, you'll move straight back in. I have to keep these people on my side, don't I? Yeah. Absolutely. Of course you must. We don't want to upset anybody. It-- it won't be for long. We'll work something out. We'll find a way. Oh, how? What do you want me to do, sneak in after dark? We've done all that. Don't piss about, Martyn. Who do you think is going to be fooled? Christ. You saw what that animal did do him. Yes, I saw. Will tonight be soon enough? Remind me, what's the story? I want to get it straight. What was it? A temporary aberration? One night you strayed into a gay club, and mistook a blowjob for the real thing? All that shit's yours. I'm not some casual pick up. What? No, fuck off, Martyn. Just hear me out, Hannah. Two minutes, please. Go on, then. When we were together, I was good father, wasn't I? Yes or no? Then why won't you believe me? Why would I suddenly go for custody? I mean, out of the blue? It makes no sense! You know, the night when you told me-- And I remember, I couldn't stop looking at your hands. Don't know why. Wasn't your eyes, or your face, but-- your hands. So dependable. It doesn't have to be this way. The hearing. Any of it. If you want to go on seeing him, I can't stop you. Just get him to move out of the house. Get him away from our son. There's worse things than being alone, Hannah. Your two minutes are up. MAN: Easy. Easy, easy. Set it down here. MAN: Evening, boys. Sleep tight. - Tight. Nice work, Chewie. MAN: Han-- There are two Stormtroopers guarding the ramp. MAN: Hey! You guys down there. Could you give us a hand for a minute? Our reciprocator's stuck on the ipto refraction. MAN: What's the problem? MAN: Hey! Look out! HANNAH: I'll be back around 9:00. FRANK: Okie dokie. HANNAH: Bye, Ollie! I'll see you later. Bye! MAN: What now? MAN: In order to escape, we'll have to eliminate the tractor beam. MAN: There's gotta be a control office here on the-- we'll have to get at it. MAN: A stormtrooper's armor. You won't be recognized in it. MAN: What? MAN: You might-- MAN: I've got a very bad feeling about this. Oh-- FRANK: Oliver? Tea. Ollie? Come here. What's this? Hm? Hm? Look at it. It's scratched the hell, Ollie. Look at it. Huh? I mean, look. If you want to chop something, Ollie, use a chopping board. It could be so simple, Ollie. I mean, that's what gets me. Because-- stop chewing that, Ollie. You look like a retard. I said-- Ow! Shit. [car horn] FRANK: Come on. I shouldn't have to show you how to do this, Ollie. You're a big boy. Come on, scrub. Scrub into the wood. That's right. Use your strength, Ollie. Push it! Push it into-- push it into the wood! What are you doing to him? Get away from him! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out of here! Why didn't you say anything, eh? Why didn't you tell me? I thought you liked him. I don't want you here. We can't leave it like this, Hannah. Just go, Frank. Leave us alone. You know why he didn't say anything? To me? Because I was happy. We still could be. Just go, will you? You don't know what it's like. Trying to get love from a child who won't give it to you. I mean, everything I do, every-- little thing, he just-- it's only his father he wants. You've had nine years to get to know him. I've never been around kids, Hannah. Tell me how to reach him. Because I don't know, Hannah. And I need you to help me. To show me. I want to love him. He'll never forgive you for what you've done to him. Neither of us will. My father used to slap me. It wasn't a big deal. It made me respect him. Respect? Jesus. - Hannah, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I went too far. Maybe I-- I was too hard on him. So that's it, then? Yes. I can't believe that I've got it so wrong again. You're not to blame for any of this. You're a lovely woman. Oh, stop it. Stop it. Stop. You don't know what you've given me. I didn't know-- before I met you-- you know, love, and-- You showed me that, Hannah. You. I love-- I love you. I love you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh, god. [moaning] [muffled voices on radio] [sigh] [muffled voices on radio] MAN ON RADIO: And I'd say the traffic I've been in-- [muffled voices on radio] Morning, Oz boz. Hey, Ollie. You gonna have something to eat? I'm not hungry. MAN ON RADIO: GWRFM, 103, on the way, details on how to win 5,000-- Ol? Come straight home. Oliver! It's something for break. It'll never happen again. And you're sure this is wise? No contact, and all that. You're OK? Stupid question. I want you both. But I'm afraid I'll toss it up, and lose you both. [bells ringing] Martyn? Sit down. [whispering] Right. [whispering] Oliver Stephen Wyatt? Hello, Oliver. So, what-- what happens now? I'm just taking him for a little chat, OK? Oliver, I'm Sally, a court welfare officer. I'd just like to ask you a few questions, really. Work out what's best for you. OK? Have a go at that one. Is that the hand that got hurt? How is it now? OK. So, what happened? Do you know what a residence order is, Oliver? It means after a divorce, a court decides which parent the child should live with. I know that. Well, your dad wants the order changed. So you can go and live with him. I need to know how you feel about that. Are you happy living with your mom? Has anything happened to make you unhappy? Is there anything you want to tell me about? Oliver? Mrs. Hannah Wyatt? And Dr. Martyn David Wyatt. Come on! Right. [shouting] She won. It goes up to the high court. The judge felt there were some unresolved issues relating to the boy's injuries which needed clarifying. Well, at least it's not over. I can look forward to an army of social workers going through my dirty laundry. And Hannah's, too? Hey, Tom! We wait? Yeah. Back on! Yeah! Are you looking for somebody? Oh, yes. I'm looking for my son, Oliver Wyatt. Dad! Oh. Come here. I need to talk to you for a minute. Come on. Get in. You OK, Dad? Where are we going? I can't go now. It's biology. We're doing frogs. Did you tell him about him, Ollie? At the court. They didn't ask. You have to tell them without them asking, Ollie. It's a legal thing. It's how things work. You've got to tell them it's Frank! It'll be all right now. Mom said it would. When did she say that? [bell ringing] Ollie? Has she known all along? I gotta go now. Martyn? I need to get some of my stuff. She knew. Hannah knew all along. Ollie told me. You know what I was going to do today? I was going to run away and hide. Take him away. God knows where. The two of us, like a couple of criminals. All the time. Hannah, that-- right out in the open. How could she do that to him? How could she? I'm glad you didn't. You know, run away. Will you stay? You think about him a lot, don't you? Your dad. Sometimes. And you think you want to live with him, don't you? Do you ever think about how they'd do it, Oliver? In bed, I mean. Have you ever seen dogs do it? Or monkeys in the zoo? You know-- up the-- Well, that's the way they do it. It's not normal, Oliver. Two men doing that in bed together. It-- it's not normal. That's why we want you here, with us. And I don't want you worrying about all that stuff they say about it being in your genes, and then it can get passed down to you. Because it won't. That's-- that's crap. Men like your father-- well, they choose to be that way. You understand? You see, me and your mom just want you to be normal. MAN: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! [humming] [buzzer] Yes? Come right up. Welfare officer. High court. I know it's a Saturday, but I was just passing. On the off chance. Right. Right. So, you, uh-- - Take a look around? - Oh, fine. Fine. Right. This is the kitchen. Living room. A bit untidy, sorry. Just the one bath. And this is-- This would be Ollie's room. This is Tom. Hi. Your room? Right. Right. It's-- it's a bit of a mess. Right. [music playing] Mind your backs, you'll be quite safe with me. Thank you. SINGER: No way! No way! Stand by me! No way! Stand by me! Hey, baby! Stand by me! Stand by me! No! Not at all! Stand by me! No! No way! No way! Stand by me! Stand by me! Not at all! Not at all! Stand by me! Stand by me! No way! "Dudley v. Maxwell," 1993. Two lesbians got custody of a six-year-old girl here in this town. Hi. Hi. [phone ringing] They're always more sympathetic to mothers. A couple of unemployed dykes took them on and won. You are a white, middle class doctor, for Christ's sake. The law was made for people like you. Maybe. Jesus Christ, Martyn. [car horn] Hey. Are you OK? Tell them, Ollie. Tell them about Frank. Tell them everything. All of it. Don't be frightened. What if they don't believe me? They'll believe you. They will. I'll be outside the school gates, waiting to take you home with me. All right? Oi! Ollie! Bye. Dr. Wyatt, you are a practicing homosexual, and you live with your male lover? Yes or no? Yes. Were you aware you were homosexual when you first got married, Dr. Wyatt? I was are of certain feelings. You mean feeling that you were attracted to other men? Yes. And, uh, during your marriage, were you able to conduct a normal, heterosexual sex life with your wife? No. Not at all, or-- or-- Barely. But in spite of that, you and your wife conceived a child. We very much wanted a child. So you did manage to have sex with her to serve that end? I hoped it would turn things around for us. And did it? Did things improve sexually with your life after the birth of your son? No. No. So, eventually you sought solace elsewhere. Did you not? Mr. Dixon-- where did you meet Mr. Dixon, Dr. Wyatt? In a pub. A gay pub? A pub for homosexuals? Yes. Did you often go to gay pubs while you were married? I went a couple of times before that, some months before. Did you meet any men on those occasions? No. But presumably you went to a gay pub to seek sexual contact with another man? I went to see what I'd feel. And when you met Mr. Dixon, what did you feel? I was drawn to him. Sexually drawn to him? Yes. When did you consummate the relationship? Milord, all this happened a long time ago. Where's it leading us? Sexual orientation and background, Milord. Dr. Wyatt wants his young son to live with him. It must surely be relevant. All right. Go on, Mr. Walters. Thank you. When did you consummate your relationship with Mr. Dickson, Dr. Wyatt? The night you met? Yes. Where did you do it? His flat? A hotel? In the back of my car. And then you returned to your wife? Yes. You now live with Mr. Dickson, do you not? Yes. You share the same bed? Yes. If your son comes to live with you, will you continue to share a bed? Yes. Even though, I understand, your son will be sleeping only a few feet away, in the next room? Yes. Thank you, Dr. Wyatt. Mr. Dickson, you met Dr. Wyatt in a gay pub, I believe? Yes. Is that where homosexuals usually meet? Gay pubs, and gay clubs? We meet in the same kind of places heterosexuals meet. To make sexual contact? Are you still a member of any gay clubs? I'm a life member. I'm asking if you still go to gay clubs, Mr. Dickson. - Not anymore, no. - No. And why is that? Because I'm in a relationship. So you do regard such venues as places primarily for, uh, sexual contact. Would you describe your relationship with Dr. Wyatt as monogamous? Yes. Isn't it a fact that most homosexual relationships are not monogamous? Well, some are, some aren't. But the male libido does rather militate against it, does it not? isn't that why so many gays are so sexually active with different partners? I can only speak for my own relationship. When you first met Dr. Wyatt, were you in a relationship then? Yes. Would you also describe that as a monogamous relationship? Until then, yes. You mean until you had sex with a man you'd just met in the back of his car? You see, the question I'm trying to get at, Mr. Dickson, is whether you can be entrusted, if only in part, with the upbringing of a young child. Yeah, well, I'll put him in a frock, won't I? That's what we perverts do. I'm not ashamed of being gay, any more than you for being heterosexual. Assuming you are. He boxed me in, Martyn. You saw him. Yes, you were great, Tom. All eyes on you. Quite the courageous little queen, weren't you? What do you really want out of this, Tom? What's this all about, Martyn? I'm not the fucking enemy here. Martyn! Mrs. Wyatt, when Dr. Wyatt told you of his sexual preferences, how did you feel? Betrayed? Hurt? Demeaned? If a woman's husband leaves her for her man, she would feel demeaned. Sexually. And I can imagine how she'd want to quickly seek sexual confidence in another relationship. And I can see how these needs-- these very natural needs-- could blind trust to the true nature of her new lover. No. That's not the case. You often work in the evening, don't you, Mrs. Wyatt? Yes. Who looks after Oliver when you're at work? Frank does. Mr. Donally. Mr. Donally? Isn't it a fact that every time your son was injured was when you were at work? Yes. How do you explain that? I have to work evenings-- Have you ever seen Mr. Donally hit Oliver? No. Never once? Not even a smack? He must be a saint. He might have, um-- smacked him once. Smacked him? Or hit him? Smacked him. Did Oliver cry? Would you answer my question, please, Mrs. Wyatt? Did he cry? Does he cry easily? So it was, in fact, more of a blow? No, it was a smack. You are very close to Oliver, yes? Yes. Yes, I am. Yes. I thought so. A strong mother-son bond. Yes. So you probably know when he's lying. Yes? Yes. As his mother, are you totally convinced by his story of how his hand got broken? Are you, Mrs. Wyatt? Yes. I believed what Oliver told me. You see, a question occurs to me, Mrs. Wyatt. What concerns you more-- the prospect of another failed relationship, or your son's welfare? [dog barking] What do you make of Oliver, Mr. Donally? He's a nice boy. In spite of everything that's happened? You're jolly generous. So we can assume, therefore, that you're concerned about his welfare? Absolutely. Yes, I am. This attack on Oliver-- the one which allegedly happened on the common-- near your home-- did you ever try and find out who the culprits were? Oliver said that, um-- he didn't know who the boys were. Did you get in touch with the police? No. In other words, you let it go? What are your feelings towards Dr. Wyatt? The fact he's homosexual? I'm sorry? You don't find the idea repulsive? Well, it's not my idea of a good time. No. But you don't feel any animosity towards the boy because of his father's sexuality? No, why should I? Sins of the father, and so forth. Please. Tell me, Mr. Donally-- do you think a child should ever be struck? No. Have you struck Oliver? Struck? No. Are you quite sure? I said no. Did your father ever hit or strike you? When I played him up, yes. How often was that? I loved my father. That's not what I asked. No, um-- when I deserved it. Children need boundaries. Limits. And if they break them? Well, you don't reward a child for bad behavior, do you? He hits me. Mhm? Where? On my head. He hit me on my hand once. That's not what you said when it happened, though, is it? You said it was an accident. Something about a car door. Was that a fib, about the car? Does your mother know that it was Mr. Donally who hurt your hand? Who suggested that you all come to court to sort this out? My dad. And what did your dad say? He said to say that Frank was doing it. And? And then I could come live with him. Is that what you want? To live with your father. So you want to stop living with your mother? No. GIRL: Daddy! Daddy! Up you come. [bell ringing] Don't push. Come on. Changing quickly, now. Changing quickly. Kingsly bones. [phone ringing] TOM: Hello? No. No, he's not here. Yeah. Right. I'll tell him. Martyn, that was Hannah. Oliver's missing. He never came home from school today. Ollie! Ollie! Ollie! Ollie? [growling] You little shit. [screaming] Jesus! Oliver! Oliver! Oliver! Come here! Ollie! Get your fucking hands off my son! You son of a bitch! Go! You fucking bastard! Oliver? Oliver? What-- Come on, you big bastard! Get up! Come on! Come on! [coughing] Space. Ollie? Hi, Ol. He's gone. And I just wanted to say that-- you could come and see me if you wanted to. Cause I'd really like that. Well, maybe you'll think about it? Cause, you know, um-- I do miss you. I'll leave it up to you. Hannah? So, um-- you'll call me? Yeah. [MUSIC - THE BAND, "I SHALL BE RELEASED"] They say everything can be replaced. They say every distance is not near. So I remember every face, of every man who's put me here. I've seen my light come shining. From the west, down to the east. Any day, now, any way, now, I shall be released. They say every man needs protection. They say every man must fall. So I swear I see my reflection someplace high above this wall. I see my light come shining. From the west, down to the east. Any day now, any way, now, I shall be released. They say every man needs protection. They say every man must fall. So I swear I see my reflection someplace high above this wall. I see my light come shining. From the west, down to the east. Any day now, any way, now, I shall be released. Somewhere next to me, in this lonely crowd, there's a man who swears he's not to blame. All day long I hear him cry so loud. Calling out that he's been framed. I see my light come shining. From the west, down to the east. Any day, now, any way, now, I shall be released. Yeah, yeah. Any day, now, any way, now, I shall be released.
