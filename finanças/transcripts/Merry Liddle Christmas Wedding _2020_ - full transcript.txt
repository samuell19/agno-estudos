[♪] [Jacquie] I can't believe what a whirlwind year it's been. So much has happened in a short amount of time. First, I got the "Queen of the Castle" deal. They're launching a new tech division and they want you to run it. [smack] [Jacquie] Then, right after that, Tyler and I started dating, and it didn't take long before we were completely inseparable. This snowman driving a convertible is kinda you. [Jacquie] His two adorable children are slowly warming up to me, and this past summer... Will you marry me? [Jacquie] Of course, I said "yes," and now here we are, exactly one year later. It's Christmastime again and we're getting married, and as long as my family stays in their lane, it's going to be... The Winter Wonderland wedding of your dreams. Garrett, I just love it. And I love how you totally get me and know exactly what I want. Great minds think alike. I mean, a Christmas Eve wedding is already so romantic, but you have taken it to a whole 'nother level. [chuckles] Smoothie? Oh, yes. Thank you. You're very welcome. And as for today, everything is right on schedule. Awesome. I have your gorgeous cake arriving shortly, the flowers are on the way, the photographer, videographer and the DJ have confirmed, and the caterers wanted to double check that none of your guests have any food allergies. Nope. None that I'm aware of. Excellent. I think we're doing great, then. What about the string quartet? Tuning their instruments as we speak. I've worked with all these people for years and they're exactly on top of their game and 100% reliable. That is music to my ears. You just go about your day with your beautiful soon-to-be family, and leave everything else to me. Thank you, Garrett. Now, you call me if you have any questions, and as usual, I'm entirely at your disposal. -All right. -[Garrett] Ta-ta. Congratulations. Thank you. [Garrett] Thank you. Hi, guys. [kids, sullenly] Hi. Come on. Dad, please. [chuckling] How'd that go? Everything's right on track. We're gonna be married in two days! My Christmas bride. Good morning, Josh and Coco. Morning. Good morning. So what's the plan for today? The hotel's organized a Christmas scavenger hunt, which I thought sounded like fun. Definitely. Then we'll come back here for a quick 30-minute lunch break, then, after that, I thought if we have enough time, we could go take a trip up the mountain in a gondola. How does that sound? Okay. Oh, come on, guys. This is awesome! All right? I'm excited for it. Okay, Dad. [phone buzzing] Oh, my gosh, my parents are here. -Already? -You know how they are with Christmas. They probably couldn't wait to get up here so they could start decorating. [snickering] [phone buzzing] My parents are here, too. Look, Josh! Dad, they're here! Yay. They're here! -Hi! -Hey! Oh, it's so good to see you! There's my daughter-in-law. Aw. Uh, where's all your stuff? What? This is it. That little bag wouldn't hold my mom's Christmas bows and ribbons. -[both chuckling] -Speaking of my parents, I'm going to go say hi to them, and I'll come and meet you guys later. -Okay. -Perfect. -Hi, Grandpa. -Hi, Grandpa and Grandma! Hey! Ooh! You look good enough to eat! How you doing, son? Hey, guys. Come on over, guys. Got it. You said you wouldn't be here until this afternoon. We couldn't wait to get up here and start celebrating. Ooh! -That's right! -Right, honey? -Hey, sweetie. -Hey. [chuckles mirthfully] Oh, no, my friend, you're gonna need a bigger cart. And bring some friends. I didn't think it was possible, but you may have even outdone yourselves from last year. Well, of course, we did. We had Christmas and a wedding to pack for. And here comes Kiara. ♪ Hi! My sister's getting married! [laughs and squeals] Hey, sis. You look fabulous, as always. I know. Thank you for not bringing your dog. I learned my lesson. And first, let me-- [tersely] We all agreed that we were gonna be on our best behavior. -Oh? -This is going to be a drama-free Christmas and a drama-free wedding. Right, Kiara? Why are you lookin' at me? I'm not gonna be a problem. I am your Maid of Honor. I'm here to make your life easier. Now, what do you want me to do? Nothing. You are totally off the hook. I've been working with the most amazing wedding planner, and he's got everything under control. So that's why you seem so relaxed. Yes. He's the best. I mean, he's got a waiting list a mile long, but he did me this huge favor because we've worked together before, and we totally get each other. Then what am I supposed to do? -You can-- -[cutting her off] You... can help us because our room is going to be Christmas Central and we gotta do it up right. That's right. Okay. I guess I can do that. Hey, Dad needs some help here. But first, let me unpack and get the lay of the land. I gotta see what we're working with, sis. -Okay. -Kiara! Come help me with this tree. All right, Daddy. Oh, Mom. You're early. Well, we wanted to spend some time together before all the wedding craziness got started. Dad, you woke up at the crack of dawn, you just drove, like, four hours to get here. Why are you wearing that? That's my comfort bow tie, baby. It is? You know it is. You look handsome. You tell him, Mom! That's where I get it from. And from you. Grandpa, you have to have a Santa Claus waffle with me. Do you think Santa will know we're here at this hotel? Santa always knows if you're good or bad, right? Yeah. So I think it's pretty safe to conclude that he'll be aware of your current geographic location. Hmm. Dad, he's seven. I just need a cup of coffee. [chuckling] How are things going with you and the kids so far? We've been doing a lot of fun stuff, but they're still mostly giving me the one-word-answer treatment. Oh, sweetheart, they'll come around. You just be patient, okay? Okay. Merry Christmas and welcome to Summit Springs. Hey, reinforcements! Now, that's what I'm talking about. Wow! I see you actually brought your own tree. I don't think you're actually supposed to-- Don't tell me I'm not allowed. No, it's just, the thing is-- I said don't tell me. Just hurry up and help me get it down before everyone else sees and they want one, too. -Go! -Don't tell me. Honey, honey. I-I got this. Sweetheart. ♪ Here comes the bride... Put that away! No way. I'm documenting everything. -You'll thank me later. -Ohh. Ava! What's going on? Ohh! Hi, Auntie J. -I've missed you. -I want a hug! Mwah! Sis! Mwah! -You look amazing. -Merry Christmas! -Nice to see you. -What's up, big bro? What's going on? Where's Royce? Oh, he's in London with his father for Christmas. London? Aaron got this big promotion and had to pack up his whole life and move there in, like, two weeks. -Oh, my gosh. -What does that mean for you in Chicago? It means Royce and I will be moving back to California! Yes! Oh, that's the best news! Do you know where you're gonna be living yet? I'm not sure yet. I mean, it just all happened so fast, you know? -Wow. -Well, you're more than welcome to stay with us for as long as you need. Thank you. Yeah, same goes for you, right, J? I mean, I just thought you'd be moving back to Southern California. [Kiara] Well, I don't know yet. Might be nice to start somewhere new and still be close to the family, and that would be you. -That would be you! -Yep, yep. Are Josh and Coco here? Yes, and they can't wait to see you. Yes! Enough of this standing around. I want to see your dress! Oh, my god, my dress. I'm so excited. -Yes. -Oh, I hope that's that fancy blender I put on your registry. We don't need another blender. I know, but I do. Girl. Excuse me. Take this. Thank you. Put this somewhere safe. Thanks, bro. That's our sister. No, that's your sister. Oh, this is gonna be so good! -The Liddles are here! -You got it, baby. [♪] I like your pin. Thank you. I like your hat. -Thanks! Merry Christmas. -Thank you. [muttering] I love my family. I love my family. [♪] Oh! Turn around, turn around. Please. -Oh, my goodness. -I can't wait. Come on. [both] Oh! It's stunning, J. I hope Tyler doesn't see you in this before the wedding, 'cause you won't make it down that aisle! [laughter] It's exactly what I wanted. It's beautiful. Oh, this deserves a toast. -Yes. -Where's the champagne? It's only 10:00 in the morning. So what? You're getting married! -[giggles] -And it's almost Christmas! Okay, you twisted my arm. Oh, my gosh. Wait, sis, you need help in this. Okay, there you go, there you go. The bride to be! [giggles] You are going to look so gorgeous in that dress. Thank you, sis. I couldn't have styled it better myself. Thank you, Kiara. -Really. -Oh... I just hope that zit on your forehead clears up in time-- -What zit? -...in a timely manner. What's she talking about? On my... on my-- I don't see anything. Gotcha! -[popping] [laughter] You! Hey, I'm pouring, okay? Ooh. You know what I was thinking the other day? -What? -How we used to play dress-up and pretend it was our wedding day. And we'd cut flowers from the garden for the bouquet and get in trouble every time. Oh, yes. And we would fight over who got to be the bride. Oh, yeah. We fought over a lot of stuff. Oh, that's true, we did. But you know what? My favorite memories in the world have always included the two of you. I'm so happy you're here with me now. I love you guys. Aw! -Cheers to you guys! -Cheers! I love you, too. -I love us! I love us! -Aw! [♪] Ho-ho-ho! How many days till Christmas? Three. That's perfect, Coco. That's right! Oh, Candis, I'm so glad that you remembered to bring your own decorations. You know, it's just not Christmas if you don't pull out your old, cherished ornaments. They're like little time capsules, aren't they? Mm-hmm. In fact, this one here, Tyler made for me when he was about six years old. Seems like just yesterday, doesn't it? And now they're all grown up and getting married! Honey, do you remember this one? Oh! We bought it in Venice on our honeymoon. [Candis] Good memories. You've been to Venice? -Oh, a couple of times. -Yeah. [Candis] We love to travel. Uh, yeah, you know, we talked about going to Europe once Wade retired. I'm still waiting for him to take me. Well, you know how I like my own bed, I like my own favorite coffee mug that you got me, and I like my newspaper. -Oh...! -Right? [Calvin] You know, traveling isn't for everyone. You do have to put up with some discomforts along the way. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. And adjust to unfamiliar customs. Yeah, but that's part of the fun. Absolutely! [Wade] Ah... come on. Long flights, you got jet lag... That's when you co-- That's when you-- You're like that when you come off planes. [laughter] Ava, do you want to put the angel on the tree? Yeah. Okay, let's go. [♪] One, two... three! [Wade grunts] There we go. Good stuff! Yes, you did it, Ava! [families applauding] Our angel is magic. Really? Yep. Last year, the power went out for, like, a really long time, and that angel turned all the lights back on. Wow. I wonder what she's gonna do this year. I don't know, but I'm just glad that she's here with us now, safe and sound, after all she went through last year. Right, Ava? Yeah. Perfect. [Julian] This is going to be a perfect weekend. Yeah, There we go. [gasping] Oh! Did you do that? I also booked us a couple's massage and arranged for a candlelit dinner in our room tonight. Well, look at you. Well, I may have a few romantic surprises up my sleeve myself. Oh, really? Mm-hmm. Well, nothing's going to top you convincing your parents to have Ava stay with them, so... That wasn't so hard. They get that we're... long overdue for some quality alone time. -"Quality alone time." -Mm-hmm. What does that look like again? Let me show you. [phone rings] What's that? Oh, that's my Facetime. Hi, Hailey! I told your parents they could Facetime us as much as they wanted. Hi, sweetie! How are you? But doesn't that defeat the whole--? Here's Daddy! Daddy's right here. Hi, baby! We miss you. [both gushing] Oh, look at that face. Smile for Mommy. -Smile. Blow kisses. -Yes, sweetie. [Hailey coos] Yes, she did it. Roses on Mommy. Roses on Mommy's head. [both gushing] [Garrett] All right, the Christmas tree should be coming on Friday, and... Let's start with the wedding arch, but please be careful with it. Mm-mm, mm-mm. Did someone win the Kentucky Derby? What is this? [scoffs] Step aside, please. Please tell me these aren't the only flowers you brought. And who are you, exactly? I'm Jacquie's sister, the maid of honor. Your sister and I have spent months going over every detail for this wedding, and everything is exactly to her liking, so I'd appreciate it if you kept your opinion to yourself. I see you've met my sister. Isn't she hilarious? That would not have been my description. When I agreed to plan your wedding, we discussed that yours would be the only voice I listened to. I've had more than my share of meddling family members in the past, and it never goes well. Absolutely. I totally get it. I turned down five other Christmas weddings to be here, and one of them was at a French chateau, all because I've always liked and respected you, but please, don't make me regret that choice. I won't. Thank you, Garrett. I really appreciate everything you've done for me. Jacquie, who is that? What...? Ooh... What is...? You are my maid of honor, which means you are supposed to be reducing my stress, not adding to it. -I just-- -No buts! You stay away from him. It's just that simple. I don't want anything messing up my Christmas wedding. But it doesn't look like a Christmas wedding with all these white flowers. We've never had the same taste in anything, but that doesn't make my choices wrong. Kiki, my wedding's in two days, and I don't care what you do or say after that, but until then, I need you to leave him alone. Okay. Hey, Jacquie. Hey! Looking good, Chris. Yeah, glad you think so. This is the outfit I'm gonna wear for the wedding. I wanted to just take it for a test run. Oh, ha, ha. You are funny. You remember my sister, Kiara? Sure. Hey. Nice to see you again. Hmph. How was your ride? Excellent. It's gorgeous up here. It is. How's everything going with the wedding? Oh, my gosh. I'm so excited. Our big day is finally almost here. I know how busy you are. I'm so glad you could make it. Of course. You know, I wouldn't miss it for the world. -You know, this is my boy. -I know. If you need a hand, just, you know, holler. -Of course. -I'll catch you later. Okay. Sounds good. What's your problem? I don't have a problem. Did something happen between you and Chris at the engagement party? No. Then why are you acting so weird towards him? [voice cracking] I'm not being weird. My goodness. That is Tyler's best friend and best man, and it would be nice if you were a little friendlier towards him. Huh. What is that look for? What? I just forgot how bossy you could be. And I forgot how annoying you are. Oh, really? Let's try again. I brought your favorite dark chocolate-covered strawberries. And I got you that peppermint bark you love. Oh! We are gonna be so fat and happy. [laughing] We could take some walks in the woods. Mm. Or maybe we'll never leave this room. [giggling] [knocking at door] [sighs] Stay there. I got it. Goodness. Hey, bro. What's up? Hey. Oh-- -Everything okay? -Not really. Kiara just had a run-in with my wedding planner, and he can be a little... cranky, and I don't need her getting in his way right now, so could you please do me a favor and keep her away from him? Of course. I'm just gonna grab-- I'll try and do the same, but we're going on a Christmas scavenger hunt, but I don't want her anywhere near him while I'm gone. [Treena] Got it. Mm! Uh... okay. Amazing. Come on! [Treena sighing] [sighs] Come on, chocolate. This is going to be perfect. Yeah, I think so, too. Have you seen Kiara? No, why? Jacquie asked me to keep an eye on her. She doesn't want her to have any run-ins with the wedding planner. What are these? Why would anyone want something dead on display at their wedding? [Garrett sighs] Small, white lights will be woven through the branches, and I can assure you, the effect will be quite stunning. Oh, here we go again with all the white. [Treena] Yeah, it's not really a Christmas vibe. It's more like we're crashing Elsa from Frozen's wedding. And how's it going to look in all the pictures? I'm sorry, are you paying for any of this? No. My daughter wouldn't let us spend a dime. Exactly. So you don't really have a say here, do you? Excuse me? [Garrett] No, excuse me. You're in my way and on my nerves. You are very rude. Remember when I asked for your opinion? Yes, neither do I! Lucas! Don't take out the orchids just yet! No, he didn't. What just happened? But now I get why we need to keep Kiara far, far away. Yes, we do. Let's go. Dad, we found the candy cane! That's great, Coco! Now take a picture of it so we can -check it off our list. -Nice job. "Candy cane." [chuckles] Look! Over there, Josh. [Jacquie] Was it crazy of us to plan a destination wedding? You wanted to celebrate the season we met without the Liddle family showing up and dropping another neutron bomb on your house. Maybe I should go back to the hotel, just in case. Stop worrying. I'm sure everything's fine. We came up here a little bit early to spend time with the kids, which is what we're doing. Well, I wish I could say that it was making a difference. Come on, let's go. You're doing great. All right? You just need to take into consideration their age a little bit more. Well, what do you mean? Okay, well, what about the time that you ordered marinated olives and artichoke hearts and bell peppers for the table? Yeah? Yeah, you meant well, but slimy veggies are the last thing that Josh and Coco would ever want to eat in this world. I mean, who doesn't love goat cheese? Me, and I own a restaurant. [laughs] Hey, but don't be discouraged, all right? 'Cause they can see that you're trying really, really hard, and they appreciate it. They just need a little bit more time with you, that's all. Yeah? Oh! Oh, honey! Are you okay? -Can I help? -Dad. Hey, buddy. -Are you all right? -You okay, bro? Where'd you hurt yourself? -Is he good? -I think he's going to be. There you go. Just a long, thick red ribbon wrapped around each bouquet, or a little holly mixed in with the flowers. That could add a pop of color, too, you know. Does your sister mean so little to you that you think nothing of disregarding her wishes? How dare you say that! -No, how dare you! -I love my sister. Insulting my style and my expertise-- What is going on? I'm just-- No, Kiara, I asked you to stay away from him! [Kiara] Why is everything so white? I'm just trying to help in the best way possible here. Because it's what I wanted-- a classy, elegant winter wonderland. But you said you wanted a Christmas wedding. Where's the joy of the season? Kiara, you are out of line. I'm sorry, Jacquie, but I warned you. I am too old and way too successful to have to put up with this. You got the old part right. Kiara! [whispers] I'm sorry. Wait. What are you doing? I'm quitting, and I'm taking all my vendors with me! You can't do that! Don't be ridiculous. Yes, I can. We had an agreement, but your family has repeatedly violated it. Oh! Merry Christmas. Really? -[gasping] -What? Garrett! Garrett, please! Seriously, Garrett, be reasonable! Don't you dare. Talk about overreacting. I mean... What? That was a bit much. Garrett! [gasping] -[all gasping] -Oh! [cake splatting on floor] [exhales in fury] [splat] Oh... It's broken. It was not my fault. Yes, we're looking for a sit-down dinner for 60 people with open bar and passed appetizers and, yeah, a wedding cake. My beautiful wedding cake with cascading roses and encrusted pearls. Okay, well, you don't have to laugh. -You could have just said "no." -I wouldn't have said no. I would have said, "I do! I do take this man to have and to hold from this day forward." Yeah, thanks for calling me back. It's a Christmas Eve wedding. [chuckles] Yes. "I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may kiss the bride." Mwah. Hey, you okay? Yes. You're gonna get cake all over you. I don't care. Bull's-eye! [both laugh] Can you spare any lights, candles, ornaments? Anything? I'm very sorry, but we're already using all the decorations throughout the common areas of the hotel. Well, can you at least cater the reception? It wouldn't have to be anything too fancy, you know. Of course, uh, I can double-check, but we are fully, fully booked. Can you double check again? -I can triple check. -Yes. Yeah, fully booked, unfortunately. But I'm pretty sure the kitchen won't be able to pull that off with such short notice anyway. Well, can we at least borrow some chairs for the reception? All of our chairs are being used at the ceremony, but, if you'd like, you guys can move 'em back and forth yourselves. You mean like, "Congratulations to the bride and groom, now please grab your own chair and drag it to the reception?" Are you nuts? Melvin... -Can I call you Melvin? -Yeah. Here's the thing, Melvin. My sister is ready to disown me. I need a lifeline. Please help me. Okay. -Okay? -Yeah. Uh, I'll tell you what. There is a Christmas market right in town. Okay. They might be able to help you out with some decorations. I love a "might". It's just a couple miles down. Thank you, Melvin! No worries. Thank you. Okay. So much, Melvin! You're welcome. Okay, where is this? -Hey. -Huh? Your mom just called an emergency meeting. ["Santa"] Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! Uh-oh. Late again. Come on, please have a seat. [Marchelle] This has been an unexpected, unfortunate turn of events. I'm sure I speak for everyone when I say how very sorry we are. Honey, we only ever want what's best for you. I don't know, sometimes, our good intentions don't always have good results. I know Garrett can be a bit of a loose cannon. I just thought we'd all pull through. We are so sorry, Jacquie. I'm so sorry, J. [claps authoritatively] Okay, that's enough moping. We are not throwing in the towel. Oh, no! On the contrary. We'll all need to step up in any way we can to make this wedding happen. There is no quit in "team"! [whispers] Is that a little family saying? -I think it might be. -Okay. Now, we've only got two days to work with, but I know we can do it, and I'm going to start. I'm going to make my mother's famous buttercream cake. How about all of you? Go ahead! Go! Uh, I can keep shooting videos and be the wedding videographer. Yes! I could do Jacquie's hair and makeup, like we did when we were teenagers. Excellent! What else? I did speak with the concierge, and he told me that there's a Christmas village nearby, and I can get some candles and decorations for the tables. I like it! Next? I can make a playlist for the reception. [snaps] Ma, you want to help me cook the food? You bet I will. We'll make Grandma Colette proud. Then we got our food covered. Aww. Don't you worry about a thing, baby, because we are going to make this right. Let's do this! Okay. -Yeah. -All right. -Come on. -Let's do it. Okay. Bring it! All right, the Liddles and the Brooks! All right, "Christmas wedding" on three. One, two, three! [all] Christmas wedding! All right, you ready? Oh, I can't go enjoy a couple's massage with Jacquie's wedding in shambles. This is supposed to be our romantic getaway. And it still will be, but... right now, I need to be there for my sister. [sighs] You know, this is our issue right here in a nutshell. What is? Today, it's Jacquie's wedding, and I get it, that's major, but we never put ourselves first. We have young children. We can't just ignore them when they need us. I know. Speaking of Ava, I'm gonna go see what she's up to. Okay. Hey, come here. We'll find time to be together. I promise. Okay. Well, of course. Thank you so much for calling, Mr. Gutierrez. Well, have a good afternoon, too. Okay, bye. [knocking] [laughing] What are you doing in there? We're playing hide and seek. I love hide and seek. Do you want to play with us? I-I can't right now. I'm working. Do you like Christmas? Oh, yeah, of course. I love Christmas. Me too, except my sister and I are worried that Santa won't know we're here. You've come to the perfect person. Come with me. I just happen to have a contact up at the North Pole. In fact, why don't I just send her an email right now and we'll let Santa know that you're a guest with us? -Okay. -Yeah? All right, well, what's your name? Josh. My sister's name is Coco. Coco. Perfect. "Dear..." "Annika. "It has come to my attention that, on Christmas Eve, two children will not be located at the address you currently have for them on file." There's also my cousin, Ava. I'll add her, too. [Julian] There you are, Josh. What's going on here? I'm just writing a letter to one of Santa's helpers to let him know that Josh, Coco, and Ava are gonna be with us this year. Good idea. That's nice of you. Josh, where's your sister and Ava? I don't know. We're playing hide and seek. Ava's it. Okay, let's go find them, and then no more running around the hotel, okay? -Okay. -Okay. Take care, Josh. Bye. Thank you. So how's Jacquie holding up? Not great, but I'd really love 30 minutes to talk about anything other than the wedding. No problem. So what's new with you? You still seeing that girl from the gym? Nah, that didn't work out. What happened this time? I don't know. Chris, man, every time I see you, it's the same story. You don't want to give anybody a chance. I'm too busy for a relationship. Oh, wow, so, so you think you're the only one in the world with a lot going on, huh? You are the bravest person I know. You go on medical missions to Africa, but when it comes to your heart-- I'm just gonna say it, man-- you bail early 'cause you don't want to get played. You're wrong about that. How am I wrong? I'm not worried about getting played. I'm just not sure I believe in love. Oh, that's nice. Did you put that in our wedding card? -Hey. -Hey. Where are you off to? Christmas village. You need a hand? I'll catch you later. Yeah, all right. I thought you were mad at me. I'm not 10 years old. I was just... hurt. But this isn't about you, this is about saving Tyler and Jacquie's wedding. Jacquie's wedding. Right. Exactly. And besides, who doesn't like a little Christmas village to get in the holiday spirit? -Okay. -Yeah? -All right. -Should I come with you? -Come on! -Okay. [♪] Thank you so much. How's it going? Uh, this stuff looks way too homemade and crafty-looking for Jacquie's taste. Nope. Thanks. Okay. I got you a gingerbread man. Thank you. All right. I could see you looking good in one of these. Of course, I would. Who doesn't look hot in a bonnet? -[laughs] -Touché. Mm-hmm. You know... thanks for helping me. You're welcome. You still haven't told me why you ghosted me. Oh. I thought we had a bit of a connection at the engagement party, and... you were the one that kissed me. You kissed me! [laughs] Whatever. We kissed and it was kind of amazing. [♪] I'm sorry. I-I don't... I don't know what you want me to say. Hey. Just tell me that you're not interested. Tell me I misread the signs. But don't just be a coward and disappear. You should take this, too. Um, what's that? It's mistletoe. Perfect for your Christmas wedding. Consider it a gift. Here, try it out. [chuckles nervously] Um... Okay! Thank you... so much for this. Merry Christmas. [muttering] Merry Christmas. Thank you. [♪] [family singing] ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ Hey! [all laughing] Hold one up for the camera. Got it. [Jacquie] Josh, that looks really good. [Julian] Got you! Good stuff. Good work, Coco. Hey, you got mine. Mom? Would you mind if I disappear? We have so much wrapping to do. -I'll help you. -Oh! They sure are wrapping a lot of presents. Okay, speaking of presents, who wants to help me go get some? [kids] Me! Okay, let's go. -Let's go! -Race ya! [wearily] Oh, man... [Marchelle sighs] And how are you doing? You hanging in there? I really appreciate everyone trying to pitch in, but it's not exactly what I had in mind. Yeah, you certainly have been thrown a curveball. Sometimes, I feel like if this wedding can't come together in time, maybe it was never meant to be. Maybe this is the universe trying to tell me something. You don't really believe that, do you? [kids] We've got presents! I can't wait for Christmas! Hey, gingerbread. Ooh. [Wade] Hey. Hey! Hey, put a little "W" right there. -No, no, put that-- -Put a "W" for me. I'll tell you what. Just take this to Julian. He forgot his phone. Take it back. I get a cookie. I'll bring it back. I'll bring it back. Boy, what am I gonna do with him? I think it's time for us to take a break from all this wedding stress, go outside, and have some fun. Okay. Who wants to go outside? -[kids] Yes! -Yes! Lie back. Oh! -All right, come on. -What are you doing? Oh, okay. Yes, treat me like a queen. -Mm-hmm. -[chuckles] Wait. Aren't you gonna peel it for me first? Oh, um... [gulps] -Nope! -Hey! [laughing] -Come here. -[knocking at door] Don't--Don't get it. [groans] What if it's Ava and she needs us? -[knocking] -I'll just be right back. Um, just-- One second, one second, one second. Oh! Hi, Daddy. Julian forgot his phone. Oh, thanks. I'll give it to him. No, I'll give it to him. I've got time. Hey, baby--Dad! Forgot your phone. Uh... Thank--thanks. Yeah, yeah, no problem. [Treena sighs loudly] What are you guys doing? -Well, we were-- -We were just about-- Is that smoked Gouda? I haven't had smoked Gouda in so long. [whispers] He just walked right in. I like it with the cheddar cheese, too. [Treena] I just got a text. [loudly] Everyone's going to a snowman-building contest, -Daddy! -Snowman-building contest? -Yes! -Now, that sounds like fun. -Mm-hmm. -Daddy, you'd better hurry if you want to join 'em. -If I want to join 'em? -Mm-hmm. Well, Mama needs you. We're all going. Yeah. -[couple] No. -Yeah! -Snowman! -No. [couple protesting] It's okay. You know what-- As soon as we change hats, he's gonna king snowman. Mr. Mayor, look at this. Take a look. Take a look, see? [laughs] This looks so good. Isn't she the most stylish and glamorous snowman you've ever seen? Snow-woman. She's ready for it all. Put this boot on, and we'll be good to go. Hi, Mr. Mayor, this is our Christmas-themed snowman. She's ready to bring joy to the world. Honey, you know nobody's gonna think of this kinda idea. Be cuter. Be cuter, come on. -Look at that face. -I'm so proud of you. No, you can stay for a minute, Mr. Mayor. Just look at that. Did you see her hat? Hi, hi! It's beautiful, right? They were very creative and made sure that it was, like, perfect. [crying out] -Oh! -We got it. It's all good. [♪] Mr. Mayor, ours is ingenious, and it's just-- it's just better than those. What do you think? What do you think? [all] Oh! [laughter and cheering] Oh, my gosh! Whoo-hoo! First place! That's what I'm talking about! And still snowman champion of the world! -That's-- -[snowball splats] [♪] It's gorgeous. [gasps] Whoa! Look! These pine cones will be great for the decorations for the tables. We just need to find a few bigger ones. Oh, there's more over there. Oh, please. -Yeah. -Thank you. So that's what you wear on your feet when you go into the woods? [chuckles] Oh, ho, ho, this is what I wear. I'm not a very outdoorsy person. I'm more indoorsy. [chuckles] Yeah, I can see that. There's that smile. Be great to see it more often. Well, yeah. If you were funnier, maybe you would. Ouch. -Oh! -Oh-- Thank you. [chuckles] I do go outside. I have a dog I walk every day. Oh, yeah? I got a dog, too. Oh! A Border Collie. Yeah, she'd love it up here, but I knew better than to bring a dog to a Christmas wedding. Huh. Oh! That one's perfect. I need this one. Okay, yeah. Get it. Can-- You can't reach it? No, here. Why don't you just get up on my shoulders? Seriously? Up to you. Do you want that big cone or not? I do. Okay, how do we do this? Put that down. Okay. Now, you want to take your left leg, you want to wrap it around my left shoulder. -Mm-hmm. -And you take your right leg, and you wrap it around my right shoulder. Are you sure about this? Is this safe? Yeah, I do this with my nieces and nephews all the time. Trust me. Whenever you're ready. Of course. Thank you. Okay. All right? -You good? -I'm good. Okey-dokey. All right? Okay? -All right. -Can you reach it? I got it. I got it. Okay. Thank you. Okay, hand it to me. Yeah. All right, now, how do we get down? Oh, um, this is usually where I toss my niece or nephew onto the couch. They really look forward to that. Okay, we don't have a couch, so where? How are we gonna do this? -Okay, no, um... -Huh? What do we do? -Well, you don't cover my eyes! -Stop turning around like that. -I can't-- -I can't see! Ah! No! Hey, hey! [screams] -Ah! -[grunts] Oh, are you okay? No! You dropped me! Where does it hurt? I'm a doctor. [giggles] Don't touch me. All right, help me up. Get me up! -Come on. -All right. [laughs] Come on. You dropped me. [laughs] I didn't drop you. Do you guys like our sign? What sign? -Hey! -What sign? You see how meticulous she is with all her artwork? Hey, that's how she was with her cookie decorating, too. It looks fantastic, Coco. -Let's go play. -Okay. Check this out. Yeah, look at that. She's got hands steady like a surgeon. Meanwhile, Josh is over here, dumping half a bottle of sprinkles onto one cookie and licking whatever's left off. Are you getting excited? [Marchelle] And how are you doing? You hanging in there? I really appreciate everyone trying to pitch in, but it's not exactly what I had in mind. Yeah, you certainly have been thrown a curveball. What's going on? [Jacquie] Sometimes, I feel like if this wedding... -Oh, can I see that? -No, hold on-- ...can't come together in time, maybe it was never meant to be. Maybe this is the universe trying to tell me something. You don't really believe that, do you? Jacquie, that's what you think? No. I don't-- Tyler, please, let me explain. Julian, really? I swear, I-I don't know what happened. I-I have no idea how that got on there. I'm so sorry, Jacquie. Ma... Jacquie! I'm so sorry. It's okay. I don't even know where he went. He won't even answer his phone. Honey, just give him a little time. He'll come back. I just feel terrible. You guys just need to sit down, have an honest conversation about how you're feeling. That's it. I mean, this is one of the biggest decisions you're gonna make in your life, and you want to be sure, right? I am sure. In fact, I'm positive. Tyler is the man I want to marry. Well, there you go, then. Then make sure you tell him that when he gets back... and he will be back. I will. What--Stop! What? Your dad said we're not supposed to run around the hotel anymore. We're not going to be in the hotel. We're going to be on the hotel. That's totally different. All right. To the roof! All right. Wow! This looks nice. Ooh. We need to find a good place for Santa to land. -Hmm. -Hmm. Hey! Over there is good! Oh, yeah! Over here is perfect. This is going to be perfect for Santa. What about the lights? -Oh, yeah! -Oh, yeah, the lights! The lights. -Careful. -Looking really good, guys. -Thanks. -Beautiful. What do you guys think? -It looks so good. -Oh, yeah. Beautiful! Now we need to find a plug. There's one. Good eyes! -Thanks. -Nice job, Josh. We did it! It's beautiful. No way Santa can miss us now. High-five, guys. Whoo! [laughing] Wait. What about your dad's shoes? He won't even notice. Oh, we'd better get back down. -Oh, yeah. -Let's go. -Oh, no, it's locked. -No, let me try. [grunting with effort] -[thumping door] -Hello? What are we gonna do now? I think we should just go back and wait until somebody comes. -Okay. -Yeah. Hopefully, someone finds us. ["Santa"] Merry Christmas! ♪ I wish you A merry Christmas ♪ ♪ I wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy... Jacquie's gonna love this cake. Mom! Sis! Look. Look what I found to decorate the tables. Oh, that's beautif...ul. [♪] Uh, have you see the kids? No, but we were just outside, and we didn't see them. Want me to check their rooms? No, I already did that. I've got my hands full here. Would you mind going and seeing what they're up to? Hopefully, it's nothing too destructive. Sure, no problem. I-I'll come with you. [♪] Let's go. Okay. Oh... hmm. -[Treena chuckling] -Oh, that child of mine. They're like little magicians. Poof! They're gone. Oh, my goodness. Ava? Oh. Who do we know who sheds red sequins everywhere she goes? What? To the roof. Let's go. I don't see 'em. They must not be up here. -Take a look. Take a look. -Okay. Just, just-- [all gasping] Hold the d-- No! No! [kids crying out] What are you kids doing up here? Well, we tried to build a runway for Santa and his reindeer, but we got trapped. What do you mea--? No, no! Oh, shoot, I left my phone! Oh, no. It's gonna get dark soon. And I really have to go to the bathroom. That's all right. Why don't you guys just show me what you guys were making up here, okay? It'll all right. It's okay. [knocking loudly] On the bright side, at least Santa will definitely be able to find us now. [kids] Yeah! You're so lucky Auntie J is gonna be your step-mom. She's so nice! Last year, when I broke my arm, she sent me this adorable little teddy with its paw in a sling and a big box of chocolate chip cookies that said "you are one tough cookie" on the side. That's really nice of her. Your own box of cookies? Mm-hmm. I know I can be a big flirt. That's always a lot of fun for me. [chuckles] But, um... anything much more than that, I always shut it right down. Why's that? I guess I'm just so focused on my son all the time that it's hard to imagine letting anyone else into our lives... at least not yet. Yeah. I don't have the best track record with dating. Tyler's always accusing me of being too focused on my career and not giving relationships a chance, and... Oh, is that so? Pretty much. It's just so easy to... get caught up in our day-to-day lives and... Right. ...you know, not think about the bigger picture. But after the engagement party, I couldn't stop thinking about you. I'm... I'm so sorry about that. It's okay. You just gave me a taste of my own medicine. [laughing] And I probably deserved it. You probably did. I probably did. [laughing] Okay. ...The wording, the theme... ...the cardstock, the calligraphy, the font size. All these little decisions were so tedious, but it was also so exciting. What were you most excited about? That I'd be spending the rest of my life with the man I loved. Funny... you didn't say anything about your actual wedding in that response. What, are you channeling Mom now? [laughs] Whatever else happens tomorrow, you're gonna be the most beautiful bride. Thanks, T. At least I still have my dress. [laughing] That's the spirit! Oh, but I wanted so much to prove to Tyler I wasn't this annoying perfectionist who gets uptight over every little detail, but that's still who I am. Yup, that's still you, but that's okay, because that's also the Jacquie he fell in love with. Now... -[phone buzzes] -Oh, sorry. One sec. Oh, it's from Julian. He... can't find his room key. You're gonna go let him in and come right back, right? Um... I'd better go help him look for it. It sounds like it's really lost. The only thing is, I just need help getting out of... [footsteps receding] ...my dress. [sighs] How am I gonna get out of this dress? [annoyed] Oh. Buttons. Ooh! Okay. Oh! You gotta be kidding me. This is a lot of dress. What was I thinking? Oh! Oh, my gosh! -What is going-- -The door! We got locked up here. That's what the brick is for. Ahh. Okay. I come up here all the time on my lunch to play my ukulele. -Oh! -Let's hear something. All right. Um, we don't need a musical selection right now. Come on, guys. Let's go. Thanks for saving us. [Melvin] All right, see you later. Okay, thank you. Thanks, man. [♪] Coco! Can you give me a hand? -Okay. -Okay. [dress rustling] Whoa, you really look like a princess. Thank you. I feel like a princess. [laughs] But I'm trying to get out of this dress, and I can't quite reach the buttons. Do you think you could help me? -Sure. -Oh, awesome. Do you want to pop up there? Sure. There. Whew. [Coco gasps] What's wrong? I'm sorry. I... I broke it. Oh... honey. That's okay. Buttons can be very delicate. Besides, you know who's really good at sewing? Your Auntie Kiara. I'm sure she can fix it. [chuckles, relieved] So is my daddy your Prince Charming? Your daddy is... definitely the man I want to marry. But can I be honest? Mm-hmm. I never really liked fairy tales. But you work at Queen of the Castle! That's true. I do. You are so smart. Here's the thing about Prince Charming. He was always the one rescuing damsels in distress, and I didn't want to be rescued. I wanted to be the one going on all the adventures. Me too! High-five, girl. -Whoo! -[laughing] I'm gonna change out of this dress. Okay. Hmm. [gasps] I know! I could do your make-up for the wedding! Oh... uh... how about we do a trial run, just to see what happens? Okay. -Sweet. -Sweet. Hmm, which color? Dad, do you, uh, do you believe our destinies are written in the stars? You know the story of how I met your mother, right? Yes, Dad. You met at the hospital. She was a nurse and you were visiting Granddad. I was just leaving the hospital, and she was just coming off shift. It was dark, pouring rain, no taxis in sight, then, finally, one pulled up. We had agreed to share it, and the rest is history. So what are you saying? I'm saying if my father hadn't torn his ACL, if there'd have been more taxis, or if it hadn't been raining, or if I'd have remembered my umbrella, we likely never would have met. So do I think our destinies are written in the stars? [chuckles] I don't know. Come on, Dad. I am not one to link celestial activity to human experience, except for, you know, the Christmas Star. Look. Son... [sighs] I don't know whether or not our destinies are written in the stars, and, frankly, I'm not even sure it really matters, because the one thing that I know for sure is how I feel in my heart every time I look at your mother. Thanks, Dad. [clink] Take a look. Whoo! [chuckles] Wow! I'm a new girl. Wait. Just a little more blush. Are you sure? Yes. I feel like that's a lot already. It's beautiful. Question. When did you know my daddy was the one you wanted to marry? Oh. When I saw... how he was with you and your brother... and I saw how very much he loved you, and I knew he was special. And I knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. And you and Josh make him extra special. I'm gonna go check up on Josh and Ava. Okay. Wait... Done. Bye! [humming] Hey, Dad! Oh, hey! Where are you off to? I am going to find Josh and Ava. Okay. Also, Jacquie said Josh and I are extra special. Well, I think she's right about that. Boom! [grunts] Bye, Dad. Hey, no running. Ah, fine. [laughs] Oh, that's a new look. I looked for you everywhere. I just needed some time to think. So what's going on over here? Coco did my makeup. What do you think? -Um... -Just leave it there. Mm. Looks like you guys had a fun afternoon. Yeah, we actually had a little breakthrough. That's good. Well, they like the part of you that's not so perfect. It makes you more relatable to them. Then they're going to relate to me a lot. I notice you brought the snow globe. Of course. It reminds me of when I first started falling in love with you. I know what you heard on that recording must have sounded terrible, and I feel really sick about it. I was just feeling so overwhelmed and frustrated with everything. I mean, can you honestly say not a single doubt crept into your head when our whole wedding fell apart? If you're asking me if I had any doubts ever about how much I love you? Never. Not one second. As for the temper tantrum of some spoiled wedding planner, I don't think it has any bearing on our future. I really want to marry you, okay? That's all that matters to me, and it scared me when you said that you had any doubts. I don't. I promise. -Thank you! -You're welcome. [gushing] Tyler... So, on every single page, I wrote down something that I love about you. [choking up] Oh... Oh... You love the way I smile with my eyes. That's one of the first things I noticed about you. How long did it take you to do this? Not long. I could've filled up three books just like that. "I love how your eyes blink really fast when you're telling a white lie"? I do not do that. Yes. Yes, you do. Yes, you do. "I'm sorry, Josh, but I don't think that the batteries in this toy can be replaced." [laughs] I remember that! [Jacquie still laughing] Oh... I love you, and I want nothing more than to be married to you. Did I blink? No. I did not. -No. -Come here. You have purple lipstick on. Yes, I do. I need you to promise me one thing, though. Of course. You will never let Coco do your makeup ever again. [♪] Oh... [humming] ♪ Jingle bells jingle bells... ♪ [giggles] I am very careful. So pretty. Mm... ♪ ...In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ Oh, enjoy it for a second, why won't you? Oh, oh. No, no, no. ♪ ...Jingle all the way ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride... ♪ Why not? ♪ ...In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Dashing through the snow... Oh, it's so beautiful. ♪ Glamorous... ♪ The bride... [squeals] Ah-hah! [gasps] Oh, oh, oh, oh! No, no, no, no, no! Oh, no, no. Ahh! [grunts] [♪] This was a Veronica Valdine couture dress from Paris. [Kiara] I'm sorry, Jacquie. I don't know what else to say. At least I fixed the button. Kiks... maybe you can give us a moment? You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. Come here. Come and sit down. I don't think we should get married tomorrow. What? I know how much it means to you to have this magical day, and this clearly is not gonna be it. I mean, look at your dress, and we've lost the caterers and the cake. And the string quartet. And the DJ. And the hair and makeup. -And the photographer. -Okay, babe. Just stop. Okay, my dream wedding has become a nightmare. No! See, because you're still gonna have that dream wedding, I promise you. It's just not gonna be on Christmas Eve. But we wanted a Christmas wedding. We did! And that's okay. But marriage is what matters, not a date on the calendar. Okay. -Okay. -Okay? [♪] [laughter] Oops. [♪] [Tyler] Hey, guys. Hi, Ma. You want to take a seat? Mm. [Tyler] We have an announcement to make. So we really appreciate everyone's efforts in trying to salvage our wedding, but we decided to postpone it. Yeah. [everyone] What? [disappointed exclamations] -No. -No, it's fine. It's fine. We're not breaking up. We're just not getting married tomorrow, that's all. And not like this. Baby, are you sure? It's just been one thing after another... -Yeah. -...and we finally decided it's time to wave the white flag. Yeah, and plus, all this scrambling around and trying to find last-minute replacements for everything, it's just ruining Christmas, guys. Well, is there anything we can do? Yes! Can someone email all the guests? I mean, there's no sense of having people drive all the way up here tomorrow for nothing. I'll do it. Thanks, T. Yeah, so it's Christmas. Come on, guys. -Okay. -Okay. Anything else? Yes. Where is the eggnog? -[laughter] -Yes! And please, do not skimp on the rum. I got you. Thank you. [♪] ♪ You know it's driving me crazy ♪ ♪ Just being away from you... Is that a snowman? No. Okay. Is it a jellybean? Stacked rocks. Oh, no, it has a moustache. -Is it an elf? -It's an elf with a moustache. Why aren't there any elves with moustaches? Yeah! There are. They're called gnomes. What? That's not true. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Gnomes are from Norway. Elves are from the North Pole. I thought-- This conversation is ridiculous. [laughing] Abraham Lincoln? Those guards outside Buckingham Palace. What do you call those guards, sweetheart? "Guards." Hey, hey, no gesturing. That's cheating. Okay, okay. Buckingham Palace... [gasps] The Little Drummer Boy! -Yes! -[exclaiming, cheering] Makes perfect sense! -We got it, we got it! -Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh, time is up. -[grunts in frustration] -[all groaning] Time's up. It's a nutcracker! Oh, you draw like a nut. [laughs] Let me show you how it's done. Let me show you how it's done. All right, all right, all right. Figure this out. -Mm-hmm. -Do it. -This is clearer. -Yes! You learning? Pay attention. Look at that. -A squirrel... -Yeah. Oh. She's good. Yeah. Better than Julian. Okay. What you call that? Squirrel. Nutcracker. -Nutcracker, right? -And a squirrel. And a squirrel. You got it, kids. [overlapping chatter] That's a nutcracker. Mamba out. Okay, there you go. I like her. I don't want to be on Kiara's team next year. -Oh! -Oh... It's okay, baby. Baby, it's okay. -[knocking] -Oh, I'm gonna go get that. [laughter] He really tried. [all talking at once] Look what just came underneath the door. It's addressed to Josh, Coco, and Ava. "Hello, everyone. I have received the children's change-of-address request, and it was my pleasure to inform Santa and all the reindeer of their current location in the mountains. Merry Christmas, from Annika, Santa, Mrs. Claus, and everyone at the North Pole." Santa's gonna find us for sure! [everyone] Yay! [cheering] Did I ever need a day like today. You deserved every single one of those spa treatments. Aw, thank you. Well, it's Christmas Eve. I should've been married by now. -You okay? -Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. What's going on with you guys? How are things with Julian? Oh, everything's good. We love working together. We get to see each other all the time and have family dinners almost every night. That sounds perfect. It is... except Julian thinks that we don't spend enough time alone together, and that I'm always letting other people interrupt us. Well, you've always been like that, T. You always help others before you help yourself, and we love you for it, but he's got a good point. You need to set aside time for you and Julian. I know. Is that why you guys are trying to make this your second honeymoon? Well, we've been trying, but even that hasn't been working out so well. Even though it didn't happen today, I, for one, am really happy you'll soon be joining the family. Oh, thanks, man. I mean, before you came along, this guy right here, he was the closest thing I had to a brother. Now I got two brothers. [laughs] -Cheers. -Cheers, man. What's your story, Chris? You planning on tying the knot anytime soon? Ooh! Pfft. No way. What, you don't know? Chris here doesn't believe in love. -What? -I don't know. I just don't prioritize it, I guess. It's called-- It's called fear of intimacy. -[laughs] -Okay, thank you, Dr. Brooks. -[laughter] -I thought you were the doctor! Yeah, okay. Pump the brakes. You don't know what you're missing, man. I can't even imagine my life without Treena in it. There's nothing better than having someone in your life who loves you unconditionally. That's facts. Yeah, okay. Maybe one day. You know, what about you? Are you excited to be moving back to California? Oh, absolutely. Royce and I can't wait to be closer to family. Well, are you gonna be breaking any hearts leaving Chicago? -Mm? -[laughing] No. No. There is no one. What about Chris? What's going on there? Mm, girl, he is fine. And such a good guy. How is it possible he's still single? I don't know. Tyler keeps trying to set him up, and nothing ever sticks. Because he hasn't met the right person yet. Mm. Maybe that's where she comes in. Yes. Mm. Oh, she likes him! Fine. [laughing] I might. I might. I like him. Okay. I mean, we have a lot of fun together. He doesn't put up with all my drama, and I think I need a guy like that. Yes, you do. And you know someone very wise once told me I need to figure out what I wanted, go after it, and make it happen. "No more sitting on the sidelines, girl." [laughs] What genius said that? It was definitely Treena. [gasps indignantly] [laughs] I have an idea. Follow moi. What about Kiara? You guys have seemed to be hanging out quite a bit. Never a dull moment with that one, that's for sure. She's cool. Mm-hmm? I like her, I guess. Okay, I like that she can make me laugh even when she's not trying to be funny. I like how she's so sure of herself, even when she's so wrong. That's Kiara. Mm-hmm. [laughs] She's super-feisty. That's pretty irresistible. Hey, fellas... [♪] What is this?

[Tyler laughs] All right. Um... what do you want? What do I want? Mm-hmm. Wow. Um... I would like to fall in love again, maybe even get married someday. You know, I've never had a wedding, and to be honest that's probably why I got a little too involved with Jacquie's choices. [laughs] I have this bad habit of pushing men away, even good guys like you. Yeah, it's like I have these two sides of myself that are always at war. I don't know which one's going to win. It's really frustrating, you know? Yeah. Uh-huh. I meant... ...what do you want from the bar? Yeah. Oh! Hi. It's okay. [chuckles] I actually do think that the universe had a say in this. You do? Yeah. Didn't the stars align last year when your package got delivered by mistake to my house? If not for that, who knows if we would have ever met. That's true. Someone up there must be pulling some strings. Yeah. [chuckles] I want to still be holding your hand when we're 90 in an old folk's home. What? I want to still be holding your hand when we're-- No, I heard you, I heard you. I'm just practicing. Oh, baby, don't do that to me. I want to grow old with you, too, okay? [laughing] Okay. So guess who never got the message that we postponed the wedding? -Who? -The minister. How is that even possible? She was on the group email list I sent Treena. I don't know. She said she never got it. -Was she upset? -Not at all. She's having a great old time at a fancy resort on our dime. I mean, I guess that's fair. Yeah. Did you get me another present? No. You've got a secret admirer. Hmm. It's from Kiara. Ooh. Careful now. It might be ticking. [chuckling] [♪] Merry Christmas! [pop!] Merry Christmas! [♪] This is for my wonderful Ava. Ma, I have your stocking. -[clink] -Merry Christmas. This is for my favorite Coco. Thank you! Oh! Merry Christmas, everyone. Merry Christmas. This is for my wonderful Josh. Thank you! Who needs one? Here you guys. Merry Christmas, baby. Oh, thanks, honey! [overlapping] Ooh! Oh. Mom, that looks adorable on you! I'm sure that I look très chic. Ooh-la-la. -Yes. -[everyone agreeing] Oh, I almost forgot. There's another piece that goes with that. Gosh, I hope it's a matching shawl. Oh, it's something like that. Let's see here. Right now, I just see a bunch of paper. You're not trying to trick me, are you, honey? [laughing] I tricked you into marrying me. [laughing] [chuckling] I don't have on my glasses. Jacquie, what do these tickets say? Paris, France. [laughing] Paris, France? Oh... honey! [giggles] Oh, baby! [Wade chuckles] -Oh... -What? Je t'aime. That's French. [laughing] I know what it means, honey. I love you, too. [laughing] Y'all thought I was too cheap! You thought I was gonna take her to Delaware! To jetlag in Paris. [chuckling] Everyone, get together, get together. -Family pic, family pic. -Okay. That's cool. ...Find my baby girl. All right.

Where'd Jacquie and Tyler go? Oh, you know what? I didn't even see them leave. -[phone buzzing] -Me neither. It's from Jacquie. "We have a surprise for you in the archway. Come in your pajamas." Let's go. -Okay. -All right. Okay! What in the world is going on? [Tyler chuckles] -Wow. -Look at this. Sit down, guys. Everybody, sit down. Welcome, guys. Have a seat. Have a seat. I know. It's beautiful, right? That's a chandelier. Yeah, there's a chandelier! Somehow, our minister never got Treena's email about postponing the wedding... [whispers] It was the angel. -...So here she is. -Oh... And we figured that we might as well get married after all. [scattered gasps] Now? Yes. [louder gasps] -Oh... -[women gushing] I did that dress! I made it, you know, messed it up and I fixed it! -It looks great. It looks great. -Thank you. Look at our baby. Hi. You look beautiful. Come. Come here. [hushed] Come on, come on, come on. Ava, Josh, Coco, come here. [Josh] Ouch. Oh, honey, are you okay? -Yes. -Aww. [Jacquie] You're okay. You just scared yourself. That's all. Come on.

Because you absolutely should. Mm-hmm. Thanks, sis. What changed your mind about getting married after all? I just realized a wedding is a promise between two people, to love and to commit to each other... ...forever. Oh... Everything else is just window dressing. And you are the window, okay? -Cheers to that! -[laughter] Cheers to that. To my maid of honor and my matron of honor, my best friends. I love you both. Aw... -I love you. -I love us! Ooh! Look at Mom's cake! [Marchelle] You like it? Guys, come look at this. That's you, Josh and Coco. Look, this is supposed to be us. [Marchelle] Grandpa fixed the top and made those. Thank you, guys. You're welcome. [Marchelle] Can everybody gather around? We all have a glass? Mama wants to make a toast. You know, I love all of my girls... ...but you, Jacquie, were my firstborn, and I just wanted to say that, as a mother... you want nothing more than to watch your children grow up to become confident, successful adults, but what really... [choking up] ...what really brings you joy, is to watch them falling in love. And especially to someone as patient and kind as Tyler! Cheers to that! Yeah, he sure is patient. Who somehow, miraculously, put up with all of us and fit right into this family like he always belonged. It was easy. [laughing] May your marriage be long, your arguments short, and your love everlasting. I love you. -Thank you. -Thank you, Mom. [♪] I know it's not the wedding you imagined. In the end... it was perfect. Just like you. Oh... [♪] [Kiara] Wow. Look at all the Black love in this room. [Chris] Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah, it's a beautiful thing. It's magical. [sighs] What are you thinking? That I don't want to watch on the sidelines anymore, and I want what they all have. [♪] What about your bad habits of pushing men away? What bad habit? Hmm? Hmm. And what about you? What are you thinking? I'm thinking how Tyler's always accusing me of being afraid of falling in love, that maybe he's right... ...but maybe I don't want to be that guy anymore. Oh, you sly fella, you. [laughs] Try again. [♪] Hey, Kiara! Oh! [laughs loudly] She caught it! Ooh! [applause, laughter] All right, turn the music up a little bit.

Where's all your stuff? We're gonna stay for another couple days. Mom and Dad are gonna watch after Ava. Yes, we are. That should've been your plan all along. No kidding. [Tyler] That's a great idea. Right? -[laughter] -Hey! Well, well, well, what do we have here? Oh, we're just going for a little bike ride before heading back down to the city, and then Chris is gonna help me find a condo in the Bay area. So you're not moving back to L.A.? I'm just gonna try somewhere new and make a fresh start... and I'll still be close to Jacquie! [laughter] Oh, I'm-- That just makes me so happy. When is the next time we're all gonna get together? Well, for the baby shower, of course! [laughs] Oh... I don't have any news. I'm sorry. [laughter] You didn't talk about that. Please, right, Ava?
