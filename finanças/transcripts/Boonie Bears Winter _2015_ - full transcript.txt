(soft melody music) (water bubbles) (soft melody music) (wind whistles) - [Bramble] This is Crystal Peaks. My mom said, whenever the mountain gets angry, it spits out fire, but fortunately, the snow on the mountain never ever melts. (soft piano music) All that snow helps to calm the mountain down. My favorite bedtime story was the tale about the Spirit of Winter who lives up there on Crystal Peaks. My name's Bramble, when I was a little cub, there were huge trees everywhere, and the sky was so blue that sometimes, I wanted to jump right in like it was the ocean. And even though times have changed, the memory still remains. (soft piano music) Uh? (soft piano music) (sniffles) Briar, Briar, my snowflake just melted. - Shh, do you hear that? Over there! (men shouting) It's them again! We need to... Huh! Why you crying? Bro, bears don't cry. All better? - Hmm. - All right, let's roll! - Where are we going? Uh, uh, Briar, wait! - To go see what they're up to. - No, no, wait! Briar, Mommy said that- (groans) Mommy said- (groans) (yells) Briar, wait up, mommy told us to stay away from them. - Everything's gonna be fine, I'll protect you, don't you wanna have a look? (classical orchestral music) (Bramble laughs) (classical orchestral music) (heavy panting) - [Woodsmen] Heave-ho-heave-ho! - [Briar] Whoa! - Faster men, faster! ♪ Chainsaws cut, chainsaws cut ♪ Chainsaws chop, chainsaws chop ♪ ♪ Side by side, side by side ♪ Trees grow up, trees grow up ♪ Trees fall down, trees fall down ♪ ♪ Take a breath, take a breath ♪ Then move on, then move on ♪ Chainsaws cut, and chainsaws chop ♪ ♪ We tough guys stand side by side ♪ ♪ Load the trucks, and fill them high ♪ ♪ Collect our pay, we don't play nice ♪ ♪ Welcome to the woods, man, watch your back ♪ ♪ Creatures are prowling on every track ♪ ♪ Keep yourselves a-moving and collect that pay ♪ ♪ Keep chopping lumber night and day, hey ♪ (engine whirring) - Why are they cutting down all our trees? - [Young Vick] Hey-yak-ha! Is somebody there? - Briar- (shushing) - It sounds like it came from over there. (tense music) Gotcha! - C'mon. (tense music) - There's no one here. Footprints? (tense music) - Wait a sec, I must be seeing things. - Ah! What the? (gasp) (yelling) Who are you guys? What are you doing? - Briar, he's kind of weird-looking. - Hmm, let's take a closer look. - What do you want? (Briar and Bramble sniffing) Hey, give me my hat! That's how you catch a cold, didn't your mom tell you that? - He has huge ears! - And you can unzip his belly. - He looks so funny. - Hey, who are you? You look so different. - Of course I'm different, my name is Victor. (sniffs) I'm gonna be famous! Ta da! Check this out! Oh, it was slippery. - It's all because of you loggers that our trees are disappearing, loggers are baddies, baddies. - I'm not a baddie, my daddy says we log so we can build. (angry groan) - You see? All the trees are gone, you destroyed our home. Because of you loggers, we bears had to move four times this year, four times! - Um, Briar, three times. - I don't care how many times you had to move, my daddy says loggers are cool. (wobbles his tongue) - No, they are not. - Yes, yes, yes they are! - Loggers are bad! They're the bad guys. (overlapping yelling) Briar! (Vick laughs) Briar, Briar, are you okay? - Serves you right beaver. - We are not beavers. (gasps) - Hey, give that back to me you beaver. - I'll say it one more time, we are bears, not beavers. - Hey, that's mine! (blows raspberry) Hey you. - Catch me if you can. - You stinking beaver, that's my axe. - Wait for me. - Give it back to me. - Come and get me. - Yeah. - Briar please stop fighting. - Yes! Hey! Come back here. - Briar. (overlapping chatter) Briar, I'm scared. (Bramble screams) Briar! Briar! (echoes) (crickets chirping) (nervous gasps) (bright music) (bright orchestral music) Wow, it's a magical land, where am I? Huh? (water bubbles) Whoa. (water bubbles) Wow. (muffled sounds) What is this place? (muffled sounds underwater) (soft melody music) (heavy rumbling) (cries) Briar! Briar, where are you? (water splashes) (Bramble screams) (soft melody music) (muffled sounds) (woodsmen gasp) - Look over there. - What is that? - Oh no. (Bramble screaming) (yelling) (dramatic music) (heavy thud) (loud groans) - [Vick's Dad] Vicky! Vicky. - [Woodman] Look! That's him. - [Logger] He is over there. - [Vick's Dad] Stay away from my son, don't touch him. - Come on! Let's get out of here! - [Logger] Vick, are you okay? (Vick groans) (loggers shouting) - [Vick's Dad] Vick, are you okay? Let me take a look at you, Vicky. Did they hurt you? Vick, say something. - My axe! Oh right, yeah, I'm alright daddy. - Bears are very dangerous animals, you shouldn't be playing with them, we'll be in big trouble if mama bear comes along. - So close! Where did you go just now? You just left me there! - Briar, I just saw the Spirit of Winter from the story mama told us. - You were daydreaming. We better go home now, 'cause otherwise, mom will begin to worry. Bramble, come on. - Coming. (soft melody music) - Mom, mom, Bramble's been daydreaming again. - I wasn't daydreaming, I really saw the Spirit of Winter, look, I've got proof. - I bet that stone hit you on the head, that's why you're acting crazy. (Briar laughs) - But it's the truth. - Bramble. - Mommy. - Briar, you come here too. - I was just joking. (Bramble blows raspberry) - Mommy, I really saw her. - I believe you honey. (Bramble chuckles) Would you two like mommy to tell you a story? - Yes please, I love stories. - There is a big lake on top of Crystal Peaks, the Spirit of Winter lives there. She is the guardian of the mountain and she makes sure everything in nature is working in harmony. (soft melody music) Under her protection, everything on the mountain flourishes. - [Bramble] That's incredible mama, I want to go and see her again. (soft melody music) - Spirit of Winter. (gentle melody music) (wind howling) (loud thud) (Briar laughing) Briar, that took me all day. (both laughing) (bird chirping) (bees buzzing) (thunder rumbling) (Bramble crying) - Bramble, don't cry. Hey, we bears are tough. (both laughing) - Hey guys. (both laughing) I'm catching up. (both yelling) - [Logger] Briar! Bramble! (tires screeching) (gentle orchestral music) (wood crackling) (loud thud) - [All In Unison] Bramble! Look at what you just did! (gentle orchestral music) (Bramble yelling) - [Briar] Come on. - Oh, okay. (water bubbles) (Bramble humming) (wind howling) (soft melody music) (overlapping chatter) Okay, coming. - He's daydreaming again, always up in the clouds that one. - [Tiki] Talking like that ever since he claimed to meet that winter spirit. (Bramble sneezes) (wind whooshes) (gasps) (groans) - Oh, do be trying a little harder. (overlapping chatter) (Tiki sneezes) Winter already! Winter earlier every year now. - [Bramble] Guys, the sled! Stop the sled! - Oh yeah! What be taking Bramble so long? (yelling) (fast-paced bright music) - What be happening here? (Tiki crying) My precious fruit. Bramble, what have you been doing? - Tiki! (indistinct chatter) - Come back to me, don't you be escaping. No! Bramble, the food goes flying everywhere. (Bramble yelling) - Tiki! Bramble! (Tiki and Bramble screaming) (distorted sounds) - Bramble, Tiki, try and slow down! (screaming) Guys, you've got to stop the sled, there's a steep drop ahead of you. (gasps) - Save the fruit. - Bramble. (wind whooshing) (both panting) - Hey, are you alright? Here. - Tell me guys, is it good news or... - All my pretty pine cones. - [Herbert] All that radish collecting time, and for what? For nothing. (somber ambient music) (wind howling) (children laughing) (indistinct chatter) - Watch out, hey. - [Weather Forecast] And now for today's weather report, brace yourself folks, we're set to be swept by one of the worst blizzards this century has ever seen. Cold doesn't even begin to cover how we'll all be feeling tomorrow, do yourself a favor and- - Well, look at what the bears dragged in! How're you doing old Vicky? Still hanging out with those talking bears? (patrons laughing) - Take my word for it boys, a catastrophe is coming, the Spirit of Winter is here and she is up to no good, I tells you. - Oh, here we go again. - Just listen, you better believe me! Once the Spirit of Winter gets annoyed, everything on earth will be turned to ash. - Listen Joe, I bet you don't have any proof at all. - [Patron] Joey boy, that tale's about as old as your wife. - Oh! Vicky, hey! I know. Why don't you first bring us one of those talking bears, the ones you've been harping on about for years now? (crowd laughs) - They do talk. (Joey snores) - I saw it, I swear I saw it, there was lava, streams of lava pouring out. The Spirit of Winter. - Wow this guy is crazy. - We've angered her, we've cut down too many trees and we're just too darn greedy. We brought this on ourselves, and we deserve it. - What does she look like? - Legend has it that when she gets angry, her face turns all red, and her eyes begin to bulge. - Does she drink? - Sounds like you Joe. (crowd laughs) - That's enough, stop laughing, the Spirit of Winter can hear you. - So, how about the evidence then Joe? - Of course, what do you take me for? Feast your eyes. Here is it my men: The Spirit of Winter. - Give us a break. - Don't come crying to me when she gets you. - Hey Joe? Joey boy? And this is why I stick to soda pop, isn't that right Joey? (phone rings) Who's there? Hi! Yes, yes, I'm in town, boss. Down at the dealer's? Right, I'm on my way. (Joey snores) (sniffs) - Oh yes, yes, come to daddy. (tense music) - I will find you. (Boss chuckles) Oh yes, I will. - I'm the hero that caught the snow monster. - Come on, it's my turn to play with it, let me see it. - Mister, that snow monster belongs to me, can I please have it back? - Hi! Here. My bad. (evil laughs) (children crying) (Vick panting) - I think this is the place. Wow! No way! Would you just look at this beauty! Sure is built for rough road! Just look at this design, it's so fancy! Wow, it's got built-in GPS, oh boy, yeah. - Good day sir, make yourself at home. You've got good taste sir, this SUV here is the latest model. Purchase her now, and I'll throw in a free air freshener. - Boss Lee, you're a devil. - So, what'd you think? This automobile can get you through the craziest of blizzards safe and sound, oh, it's worth every penny. - All right, I'll take this one. - Very well, sir, you won't regret it at all. So, after tax, this is the grand total right here. (spits) - Is this a joke? It should have been paid for, by my boss Mr. Lee. - Oh right, Mr. Lee, your car is right over there. (sneezes and coughs) Well sir, here it is, the keys, and enjoy your ride. - Well, I knew it was too good to be true. Hello, Boss Lee, what's the big idea? You promised me a fancy car, but now I'm stuck with this bus. - [Boss Lee] Oh, you're welcome. I'm telling you, Vicky, that's a genuine retro bus, all the kids are playing in them, it's all the rage. And it's got to be better than a horse and cart, anyway, it's worth much more than it looks like Victor, so you go ahead and enjoy. I gotta get going, I'm due up on the tee. - Boss, it's cheaper than me! And I was stupid enough to trust the old geezer. (car engine rumbling) What's this about, huh? Ah, no way! Darn it! Oh come on! This is just unbelievable. (coughs) Just my luck. (gentle tense music) (camera shutter clicking) - Right this way, let's hop on that bus there. - All right. ♪ With a hammer and a screw, it's amazing what you can do ♪ ♪ I'll turn this piece of trash, into something new, ♪ ♪ I am not just a logger, you see it's true ♪ - This one on top. I said, put that case on top! There you go! Just like that. Awesome! Don't move. Perfect. - Who are you three! Get off my bus. - Handsome, gimme a pose. - Me? - Million dollar smile you got there, nice. - Flattering! What are you doing, huh? This is a private vehicle, now beat it. - Oh, I read you! Oh man, let me think. Now how about a bribe? It usually works. - Oh yeah, say no more! Where to then? - Crystal Peaks. - No prob. Let's do it. (engine coughs) - [Tiki] It's all Bramble's fault. (overlapping chatter) - [Briar] Calm down, guys. (overlapping chatter) I'll fix this, don't you worry. - You better be fixing, this won't last long. And this timing, making sure Bramble takes responsibility. [Briar] Oh, believe me, he will be. - Briar, don't letting him keep bullying you. - Take care guys. (soft ambient music) What? There is nothing left in these. Alrighty. Hmm, I wonder. (fire crackling) Bro! (Bramble screams) - Hey bro. - Listen, we need to talk about what happened. (overlapping chatter) Okay, you first. - Uh, Briar, it's all my fault. (sobs) We lost our food sled because of me. You see, I was trying to steady the sled and I saw something behind the trees, it was a white bear- - Wait, hold on a sec, which white bear? Is it the one that... - Yeah, that's right, it's her, I saw her, but now she's all grown up, she's about this big now. - Hold it there Bramble, enough about that white bear, I want you to tell me what's going on with you. - What? Going on with me? (Bramble sniffs) Briar, there's nothing wrong with me. (Briar growls angrily) I'm telling you old brother of mine, it's her for sure, I'll never forget those antlers on her head. I've been dreaming about seeing her again all my life, and now that dream has come true, yeah. It's been so many years and I thought I'd never see her again, when she showed up, I couldn't believe my eyes, and I mean, obviously I followed her. I totally forgot about the sled, and then it got out of control and rolled down the mountain, and she just disappeared. Hey, Briar, please listen, Briar, I'm telling the truth, I promise, really. Where is it? Come on! (metal clanking) You see! Check it out bro, this is the stone, the one that fell off- - Enough. - But bro. Briar, I'm your brother. - I've had enough. Bro, you gotta cut it out, I have protected our home, protected the guys, and I have to look out for you. Look at you, you're good at nothing but causing trouble, all these years I've been hoping you'd grow up and become an adult, even just a little bit mature, but you just won't, will you? Rather than standing up and taking responsibility for yourself, you just come up with excuses. (angry growling) (wind whistling) (soft piano music) (fire crackling) (wind whistling) - Uh? Why are you crying? Bro, bears don't cry. All better? (laughs) All right, let's roll. (soft piano music) - The one that fell off- - Rather than standing up, and taking responsibility for yourself, you just come up with excuses. (soft piano music) (Bramble sobs) - [Mama Bear] I believe you honey, would you two like mommy to tell you a story? - Yes please, I love stories. - [Mama Bear] There is a big lake on top of Crystal Peaks, the spirit of- - Mommy. (sobs) (soft piano music) - Hey Sire, there goes Briar. He'll leading us to Bramble, Babu, let's go. - Right. (fire crackles) (dramatic music) (Bramble screams and pants heavily) (faint gun shot) - Arnold, we're here to catch the bears. Ow, my ears! We are not here to shoot the birds. - I'm sorry, it's so cold. Hang on here, hey, how come you're not chilly, huh? - Oh Arnold, I have my ways, check these out, so many heating pads. - That's... What're they for? - Uh, these things? Do I have to spell it out for you? Look, they're all over my body, pretty cool, yeah? - No kidding. - [Arnold] I'm pretty jealous. - I thought you guys were tourists here, so what's with the bear catching? - Well, it's not just any bear, we- - Hi. - You gotta be kidding me! - Relax, okay? Chill out! Listen pal, you have been paid, now you just need to get us there, okay? - You heard him. - Loud and clear. - What is Logger Vick doing hanging out with those suspicious looking guys? - We'll reward you once it's done. - [Thinking Loud] Is it the bear brothers they're after? (camera beeping) - What is that? - Ow! (evil laugh) Should I go warn the bears? - Look, the bear is coming, follow me. (dramatic music) (wood crackles) Freeze! Get on the ground. - [Thinking Loud] And what does that mean? - Let's roll. - How did I get into this? - What am I gonna do? (tense music) (growling) Huh? What is that? - Ah, what was that? - Shh, don't scare her away, we'll take her by surprise. (growling continues) Keep your eyes peeled. (beeping intensifies) Wow, she's right here. - Oh man, this ain't good. - Ready, go! - What exactly are you looking for? - You'll find out soon enough. That's not gonna work, you gotta use these. (loud rumbling) - Is it just me or is this wall shaking? - Just keep going. (yelling and screaming) Did you see that? - I knew it's her. (camera shutter clicking) - Neva, is that you? (loud growling) - Huh? Bramble! - Sire, what now? - Follow. - Good job. (dramatic music) (yelling and screaming) - No, she's got us. (screaming and yelling) - Help me take her down. - I'm getting outta here. (bear howling) (heavy footsteps approaching) (bear howls) (overlapping chatter) (bear howls) (screaming and yelling) - Could it just have been a dream? Hey, what was that thing? - Well, my little friend, what you just saw was the Spirit of Winter. (tense music) - Wait for me, Neva! (fast-paced panting) I'll find you no matter what, I won't lose you again. Where'd she go? (Bramble yells) She can't be far. (soft melody jingles) (bear growls) After so long, it is you. Hi there! Hey, Neva! Hey, what's wrong? It's me! Calm down. Don't you remember? (bear growls) Neva- (bear growls) Somebody help me. (Bramble sobbing) Huh? What happened? Oh, the stone. Neva, wait up. (heavy thuds) What is she doing? It looks like she's in pain. What is that? - Bramble! Bramble! What happened here? It's still a bit warm, he's nearby. - Sire, what happened here? - How should I know? Come on! - I need to think of a plan. Hey, I know. (growls) She likes honey balls, just like me. (Bramble pants heavily) (soft piano music) What am I gonna do? (soft piano music) (bear growls) (soft piano music) She looks so happy. Hey, wait up. (loud thud) (soft ambient music) Hey Neva, do you remember me yet? I'm Bramble, remember? I bet you do. This is the happiest day of my life. (Bramble chuckles) Hey, I hope you don't mind if I call you Neva, you just look like one. (Bramble slurping) (soft piano music) That's it! There! Are you starting to remember now, Neva? This is... I mean, it's where we first met. (soft melody music) (fast-paced upbeat music) Stay away. (bees buzzing) (fast-paced upbeat music) (Bramble chuckles) Thank you Neva. This is the best gift I ever got, you want some? (fast-paced upbeat music) (water patters) (soft melody music) (fast-paced upbeat music) (Bramble chuckles) (fast-paced upbeat music) Neva, you are my best friend. Magical! Hey world, I'm here with my best friend Neva, the coolest girl ever. (soft piano music) Neva, guess what, you know what my mom told us? When you see those, you can make a wish, this is so awesome. I wish my brother Briar was here as well. Briar's pretty much the best brother in the world, ever since mom passed away, he's been taking care of me. I'd never make it all on my own, sometimes I wanna cry, but Briar's always real tough, "Bro, hold that head up high." Anyways, that's what he always told me to do. She's sleeping. (gentle piano music) I could have sworn that this was yours. Oh well, never mind. (Bramble giggles) Sweet dreams Neva. (soft melody music) - Hey Maurice, so much for being cold-proof. - You shut your mouth, not my fault, the beast stole my heating pads. - You've got 30 more. - Maurice sure loves his selfies, it's tacky if you ask me. Whoa, comments! Hang on a sec, I've seen those things before on one of the pictures I took. (engine whirring) - [Arnold] And that's why the monster ran away from me, and not you. - It's not a monster, it's a mystical spirit, and the only thing it was running away from was your breath. (Maurice laughs) - Maurice. - Yes Boss? - Hand me your coat. - But it's so cold. - [Boss] Arnold, give him a hand. - I'm on it. - Quit that Arnold, leave me alone. - Well, I'm gonna get you within an inch of your life. Serves you right. - Oh, I just got a plan. (evil laugh) (dramatic music) (Bramble pants heavily) - Where is she? Neva! Neva! Neva! There you are, you scared me. (squabbles) Sleep well my little Neva, I'll go get some breakfast. - Babu, how could you be losing Briar? Go find him. - But Sire, I just haven't eaten. Sire, where did that food come from? (nervous laugh) - Babu look, Bramble. (Bramble hums a tune) - Bramble? (Bramble hums a tune) - He seems so happy, which means.. Follow me. There is nothing but emptiness, Why he be so happy? (soft ambient music) - We made it. - With this equipment, I'll definitely catch the beast. (evil laughter) - We'll be rich. - Oh yeah. - Come on. - This is not making any sensing, where could Bramble have hidden his treasure? I don't get it. - Sire, doesn't it feel colder than usual over here? I have a bad feeling. - I will protect you Babu. - I swear something was right there. - Babu, very cowardly, not good enough. - But I was so sure. - Actually, it is cold. Uh? My banana? (both screaming) (Bramble hums a tune) (Bramble shivers) - Could it be those bad guys from before? I won't let them capture Neva. You'll never take her. - Whoa! - Briar? - What are you doing here? - Stay back, stay back, please don't eat me, eat Babu, he is much more crunchy. (Tiki screams) - Isn't this a blast, Sire? - Actually, it's great. That stingy Bramble, keeping this animal all to himself, he is very tricky. Babu, let's play. (bear growls) (evil laugh) - Sire, what do they want? - Nothing good I betting. (tense music) (bear growls) - Icy breath? All right then, let's see if you can handle this. - Thermal heat-seeking missiles. (muffled sounds) (tree crackling) - Fools, how could you miss that close? (overlapping chatter) Oh yeah? We will just see. - They're getting nearer. - Oh no. - Take that. (trees thud) (tense music) - I'll have to do it myself. (bear growls) (evil laugh) Hey, you two, catch up. (evil laugh) (yelling and screaming) (tense music) (evil laughs) - Finally got you, calm down. Now, call Logger Vick and tell him to bring the bus here. - Yes sir. - Oh no, I need to find the bears. - Bramble... - I'm still mad 'cause you don't believe me. - Uh? - Ah! Neva! Neva! Neva! Where are you Neva? - What happened here? - We need help. Briar, Bramble, go save her. - Save who? - She was attacked by bad men. - Just calm down. - It's the bad guys, very bad guys, they got Babu, and they caught the giant bear. - Giant bear? Who? What are you talking about? - They went into town, you gotta hurry. - Right! Are you sure? - Oh yeah! - Bramble? Where'd he go? - Don't worry Neva, I'm coming. (fast pants) What the...? The tracks disappeared. (man shivers) Excuse me! Hey come back. - [Man] A bear. (men shouting) - [Crowd] Where did he go? - He couldn't have gotten far, let's split up. - It's my sister's turn, get off the car you meanie. - Hi. (children crying) - Don't cry, come on. - [Crowd] There he is. (tense music) - Outta my way. (crowd shouting and yelling) Finally. - Bramble. (Bramble screams) - Quiet down. - Briar, how did you... - That's not important, what's the problem? - Problem? Neva needs my help. - Come back, think about it, you can't go out looking like that. - Hands off me, Neva is my very best friend, I have to save her. - What? All alone? Are you crazy? - I don't have a choice. - And what about us? - But bro, you don't even believe she exists. - I'm still not going to let you run off alone. - Are you serious? I can take care of myself. - Take care of yourself? What, are you trying to make me laugh? - You never believe it. - Shut up you two, this is not the time to arguing, don't you have any sympathy? (Tiki cries) - Why, what's wrong? - They take Babu, don't you see? If something bad happened to him- (blows nose) Who would be doing my laundry and cooking? (Tiki cries) - Tiki, do you have any ideas? - Certainly, but Bramble has to make sacrifices. - You bet I will, anything. - Alrighty, now repeat after me. I am a dog, I am a doggy. - I am a dog. (Tiki barks) (Tiki sniffing) - Bro, you think this will work? - We don't really have a choice. (children laughing) - Briar. - Maybe there is a clue in this trash over here. - Big as a mountain, tall as a tree, Spirit of Winter, please don't eat me. - Who taught you that? - Old Joe taught me that, he did, let's go ask him. - I don't know, he is really scary. - I'll protect you. - It's all finished. Hey kid. - Bramble, come here! Guess what, Tiki got a clue. (Tiki barks) Another garbage can? Sorry to get your hopes up. - Babu. That's great. - What the... Oh Sire, I thought I'd never see you again. - Babu, how'd you get in there? - Babu, do you happen to know where they took my friend Neva? - Guys, it's real bad, they boarded a train. - What! - That's not good. (train rumbling) - [Salesperson] Stop, thief. - [Tiki] You be calming down, those are premium bananas, more than enough for this car. Get outta my way. - [Briar] Where'd you learn to drive? - I did not, how hard can it be? Babu, metal to the pedal. - Sire! (train rumbling) (Vick groans) - Well, go on, eat it. (bear growls) Don't you worry, I'm here. I guess Old Joe was right, you're the Spirit of Winter, but you look funny with those antlers. (bear growls angrily) (evil chuckle) - After so many years, I finally caught you, but it was worth the wait. Can you begin to imagine what I had to deal with? All those people laughing at me when I told them about you, treating me like I was crazy or something. But I'll get the last laugh, that's right, I'll become rich, and make all those people who doubted me bow down before me. Years of ridicule coming to an end, I feel invincible. (bear growls) I don't care if you have magical powers, I've figured out a way to tame you. (bear growling) (tense music) - Briar, we have caught up. - Tiki, you did it. - But of course. - How do you feel now? (loud rumbling) - She's getting really angry. - I need a picture of this. - [Thinking Loud] He's pushing her too far, she's going to break free. (bear growls) - What's wrong? - Boss, Boss, there's a problem. (chattering) - Wow! Hey, get them. (loud thuds) - No big deal, Babu, step on it. (loud thuds) - Briar, will Tiki be okay? - Probably, he's got thumbs. - Wait, what? (both giggle) - Serves you right for thinking you're human. - Goodbye my beloved luxury vehicle. - Bro. - Neva, Neva. (Bramble screams) (overlapping chatter) - Even if they got on, your breath will drive them away. - You'll need this if you want to rescue her. - Give it. - Come and get it. - Briar, what now? - I'm thinking. - Wow, these bears can talk. - Attention all passengers, this is your captain Tiki, Welcome aboard in my new train. I'm just letting you know that the food cart has been raided, and there is no lunch. (metal screeching) My mistake. - Bramble, the phone. - Don't let them get the phone. (dramatic music) Get it. - I got it. - Come here you. - Maurice, up here. - This ends right now. (tense music) - Open the door. - No way. You wish. - What're you doing? Are you crazy? - Give me the gun. (train rumbling) - Hey, stop the train. - Granny, take your time, we're in no rush. (screaming and yelling) Watch out granny. (yelling) (woman screams) (metal clinking) (Bramble yelling) - I got it boss. Let me go, it's really cold. (both yelling) (machine beeps) - Stay back. - No, wait. - I'm coming. - That was awesome. (tense music) (yelling and screaming) - I'm telling you, it was the size of a house. - That sounds awesome. - What does that mean? (Joey yawns) There's my ride. (dramatic music) (children cheering) (bear growls) - [Kids] Wow! (tense music) - Huh? What? (bear growls) (dramatic music) (loud rumbling) (Boss screams) (glass shatters) (crowd coughing) - Are you all right sonny? - What happened here? Was that some kind of flying train? - Am I crazy or did you all see that too? (children giggle) (train honks) (bear growls) - Everyone, look. - Whoa! - [Bramble] It's beautiful. (all giggling) (engine whirring) - So what do we do now? What's the plan? - The beast will tear down our homes, you just wait and see, there's only one thing that will save you from your doom. (crowd gasps) - Question. What do we do? - Legend tells of a great hero, one that stands high above the rest. - Goodie. - Really? - And where exactly is this hero? - [Crowd] Yeah, where? Tell us about it. - Let me think. - [Maurice] He's right up there. - [Man] There he is. - I shall protect this town from the Spirit of Winter. - I can't wait for you guys to meet her. Hey Briar, this here is my best friend Neva, Neva, this is my big brother Briar. (Briar chuckles) - Hi. - This creepy little guy right here is Logger Vick, he's not so bad once you get to know him, and these two are Tiki and- - Okay, we've met her already. - Oh yeah, I forgot. Neva? Neva? (all screaming) - What's going on? (all screaming) (bear growling) (loud crash) (tense music) - Where are we? - Neva! Neva! You became smaller. - What happened? She looks weak. - What the... (groans) - What's going on with her? - She is trying to calm herself down, or else she'll turn into a monster. - Logger Vick, you take that back, she's not a monster. - Look, I mean it, this was on the train with us, she's the Spirit of Winter, the one Old Joe always talked about. - Neva. - If the spirit loses control of her anger, the volcano will erupt and destroy the land. According to Old Joe, the deforestation of Crystal Peaks caused the Spirit of Winter to become restless and vengeful, it won't be long before she loses control and destroys us all. (bear growls) - No, it can't be. Neva is not like that. (rumbling) It's not true, Neva wouldn't do that, she's kind and gentle, stay away from me. - Bramble? - Neva. Look, the stone, I brought you back your stone. - Far out. (soft ambient music) - We need to take her to Crystal Peaks, that's where she'll be able to regain her strength, just like mom said in the story. - That's right. - Neva, please don't go. (sad brooding music) - What is she doing? (soft ambient music) - Bramble, what are you doing? Hey! - Briar... (Bramble crying) I have to do this, I have to be with her. - Bramble! - Okay, if he follows her, he's going to die, we have to do something. (wind howling) - I told you all the beast was real and you didn't believe me, and now, we're gonna... - Hey, put a cork in it. - Hey boss, this is going to work, it's a really good plan. - I know that. Well, they wanted a hero, so I gave them one, a hero that could be defeated by his own strength. - Yeah, right on, I can't wait to see you in action. (laughs) (wind howling) (Bramble groaning) Neva, don't give up, I believe in you. (Bramble sobs) (wind howling) Neva! Neva! (wind howling) Neva, are you alright? What is happening to you? Neva, you can't sleep, get up. You have to listen to me Neva. Tiki? Babu? - Are you ready? Let's do this. (dramatic music) - Out of all the junk on this train, I can't find one useful part, how am I supposed to get back? (car engine roars) - [Logger] There's debris on the road, we gotta continue on foot. - I'd better stay hidden. - Ah jeez, it's cold. - All right gentlemen, time for a hike. - Boss, the base is like eight miles away. - True, it's far from here, but to save all of our lives, it's not too far. (crowd shouting) - Now, what am I gonna do? - [Man] Come on men, don't fall behind. (engine whirring) (soft ambient music) (Tiki sneezes) - It's so cold. (Tiki shivers) And I'm starving to death. (spits) Snot is a dish best served warm. - Thank you for helping out. - Don't mention it, it was our pleasure. - Sire, look over there. (soft melody music) (bright music) - [Briar] Whoa! Bram, it's beautiful. - This is it, we made it. - Crystal Peaks. - Wow! Magnificent. (Tiki giggles) - Tiki, be careful. - Neva. - Bramble. - Neva, are you okay? (soft ambient music) Those are the stones from my dream. - They're ginormous. (soft ambient music) - Neva! Neva! Are you okay? Should we take a break? - She has to keep moving. (soft melody music) - Wow, look at that man. - Whoa! Trippy. It's like a dream. - Wow, look at that. Neva? (soft ambient music) - It's finally working. (soft ambient music) - What's happening? - She's finally healing bro. (loud blast) - Neva. (men shouting) - Kill the beast, don't let them get away. (men shouting) (fast-paced dramatic music) (bear growls) - You're mine. - No, Neva. (electricity crackles) (men shouting) - Bramble? Are you okay? Bramble! Bramble! - Neva, you really are my best friend. - This ends now. - She is getting bigger. (men shouting) - What's happening? This can't be good. - We have to stop her. (thunder rumbling) - Neva. Oh no! Neva! (bear growls) - You two go take her down. - Take aim. - Fire. (bear growls) (muffled sounds) - Come on, this is too dangerous. - No! Neva! Neva, no more! (men shouting) (loud rumbling) - Look, Crystal Peaks is erupting. (crowd gasps shockingly) (bear growls) (yelling and shouting) (panting) - Are you guys getting on? We don't have all day. - Bramble, come on. Faster Bramble. (bear growls) (loud rumbling) - Quickly, we're going. - Grab my hand, come on. (loud rumbling) - I hope we got everyone, 'cause it's time to go. (phone rings) Hello! - [Boss Lee] All right, listen up Vick, if you don't want the bus, you're gonna have to pony up the difference for a new truck, I'm not paying a single dime more. - I'm kinda busy here, Briar, hurry up. - Bram, hold on tight bro. (bear growls) (rumbling) - Neva. - Bramble, quick, give me your other hand Bramble, hurry up. - No. I can't. - What? What do you mean? - I have to go back for Neva. - Bro you can't save her. - It's okay, I can do this, trust me Briar. - No, wait, hang on. - Bramble! Wait! Bramble!. - Sorry, guys, I gotta do this for Neva. - [Mama bear] Bramble, this stone holds the tears of the Spirit of Winter. It keeps her harmonious, so she can keep the peace from atop Crystal Peaks. - Now I understand. (tense music) (dramatic tense music) I'm coming Neva. (dramatic music) (bear growls) (Bramble yells) (bear growls) - Briar. - Told you that wouldn't work. - Briar, quick, we need to get the stone between Neva's antlers. - All right, take us up. - Okay. (tense dramatic music) - It will calm her down. This is the only chance we have to save Neva. Be careful Vick, watch out for the fire. (dramatic tense music) - What are you doing? - Bramble, are you ready? (dramatic tense music) (bear growls) - Briar, it's time. - All right. - Logger Vick! - Oh yeah. (Vick giggles) (Briar screaming) - [All In Unison] You got this Bramble, lets do it. (loud rumbling) - No. (Bramble sobbing) (Talking to himself) Briar! Logger Vick! Thank you, guys. Neva, I'm coming for you! (loud rumbling) (soft melody music) (loud thuds) (soft somber music) Neva. I love you. (soft melody music) Where am I? - Hey wait for me guys. - Tiki, Babu. - Briar. (soft melody music) - [Teacher] Now you boys just wait here until your mothers arrive. (kids shouting) (overlapping chatter) - Hey Dad, watch me, watch me, I can do it, I can do it. - Again. - Timber. - Wow. - [Logger] Hurry up boys. (engine whirring) Briar!

(both laugh) - We're hiring - [Bramble] Mama, can you tell me about the Spirit of Winter again? - [Mama Bear] I told you that one last night. - [Bramble] Please. - [Mama Bear] All right sweetheart. Long ago, up in the beautiful snowy mountain range called Crystal Peaks, lived the Mystical Spirit of Winter. She protected the people of the local town, providing them peace and prosperity. However, the local people became greedy, they drained the rivers, cut down the trees and destroyed the animals' homes. Eventually, their greediness provoked the dormant volcano to awaken with a mighty vengeance. The peaceful ground cracked, lava burst out streaming everywhere. The sky darkened, and the earth shook. Suddenly, the Spirit of Winter awoke and cried out to the furious volcano, stopping the lava, soothing the earth, and bringing snowfall to the mountain range. Crystal Peaks was again at peace, cooling from the winter brought on by the Mystical Spirit. The mountain range and the town were restored back to normal. - [Bramble] What happened later Mama? - [Mama Bear] It is said that the Spirit of Winter is sleeping within the depths of Crystal Peaks, keeping the vengeful volcano at bay.
