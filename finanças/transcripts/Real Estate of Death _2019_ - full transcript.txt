Did you see it? I think the guy from the gas station was looking at me. Really? Why? Well, I don't know, perhaps he was flirting. Oh, boy, I did not get it. Hey, did you see the barbecue grill over there? It is so big, we could barbecue a bull inside it. I liked the pool better. Oh, yes, true, the pool. I like the shallow side. True, that is the good side, it is not so deep, isn't it? 'Cause I can't swim. You can't swim, you can't float, you can't do anything. You smart ass. Hello? Hi. What's up? No, actually, I'm kind of busy, I can't talk, my fianc√© is here. Who's that? Hold on. It is the lady from the buffet and decorations. Oh, ok. For the church. So, we are driving in the country, to have a look at some houses, homesteads. Yes. What? Ah, baby. Yep. Wait a sec. She wants to know if you'd rather white roses, or calla lillies for the church's decoration? Well, which one do you prefer? Lillies, right? I find them more elegant. Then, lillies, ok? Then we'd rather the lillies. Yes, ok. One sec, let me ask him. Have you decided which flavor for the cake filling? I dunno, strawberries, chocolate. But you don't like strawberries. Ok, but it is a party, right? Check with the invited guys, what do they like better? Ok, baby, ok. So, he doesn't like that. Ahem, ok. He said to me strawberries, but I don't like them. So, keep peaches. You don't mind peaches, do you? Peaches? No, that's fine, I just find them a little... You said you don't care. Ok, I find them a little weird, you know? Ok, we will take peaches. Daisy, peach cake? Do it like that... I can't talk here. Ah look, Baby, here for rent, too. Hold on, I can't hear you. Can you hear me? Look, Daisy. She can't hear me, she can't hear me. She can't, but do you have signal here? Can you hear me? Hello? Hi, I can hear you now. So, we are here, practically in the middle of a forest. Yes... I told you, we came to look for a homestead. Hello? Hello? So? Hello? Call back. Hello? Hello? It was cut, no signal. Well, we are in the middle of the woods, that's why, Daisy. Baby, did you make your notes in the gift list? Yes, yes, everything is there. I will call them. Stop, baby! Did you see the for sale sign? I saw one sign. It is for sale. Get back, get back, let's see that house. I guess there is nobody home. Hello, how is everything? We saw the for sale sign and came to see the house. Good morning. He is deaf. So, you came to see the house? Yes, we saw the sign. Please, come in. Thanks, come. Let me apologize, ma'am. My name is Anderson, this is my fiancee Daisy, and that is my sister, Rebecca. I'm Norma, this is my son Douglas. Please, make yourselves at home and get to know the house. I will make some tea for you. Thanks. She is so kind, isn't she, Darling? Baby, I just love these stairs, like in those old movies. Wow, honey I just lost track... ...of how many rooms there are in this house. Yes, but now there are no lights here, this is going to cost some dough. But for the price she is selling it, it is a bargin. Let's do something? Let's go to the lake, see how it is. Let's go. I brought some tea for you. Sweetheart, have some tea, you will get better. Yep, she is not all right. Not really. Have some, sweetheart. You are very kind, ma'am. Thanks. You are not eating, you should eat something. - Make youselves at home. - Thank you. Have some tea, Rebecca. You can have it, it is not going to make it any worse. Thanks. It is so beautiful, your necklace. It is my family's jewelry, it belonged to my grandma. She had such fine taste. Thank you. Thank you for the tea. ma'am? Yes? Has it been a long time you have lived here? Oh, many years. It has belonged to my family. My husband was not an architect, but like if he were. He was the one who did all the redecoration. He had such a great taste, you know? He did. Unfortunately, he passed away in a car accident. He was with my son. Oh, so that's why he doesn't... Yeah, that is why, but he is fine otherwise. All right. Sure he is. Was it a long time since he had that accident? Yes, a long time. It is just he and I here, it is such a large house. And you take care of everything by yourself? By myself. Oh boy, baby. That is why I want to sell it and buy a smaller property. Oh, I see. Please, I know it is quite humble, but I used to have a wonderful table, a beautiful dining room. Full of crystals, candle holders, chandeliers, fine trays. It was so beautiful. But unfortunately I had to sell. But I made good money. I figured. Everything is fine, just so cozy. Thanks for everything, you know? My goodness, this girl is not all right. You had better spend the night here. Nope, ma'am, I thank you, I really do, but no. I insist you spend the night here. No, you do not have to bother, ma'am, we are leaving. The weather is stormy. When it rains the road gets undriveable. Besides, she is not fine. I will make another tea. And tomorrow she will be all right to take the road. Make yourselves at home. Only for tonight, tomorrow, early, we leave. Daisy, sleeping over at a place of somebody we do not know well. But it is only for tonight. Don't you like the countryside? Tomorrow morning we leave. Baby. Baby, am I wrong or... ...is her son staring at me in a weird way? Daisy, stop thinking everybody is looking at you. If you need anything, just call me. Thank you, ma'am, we are fine. if I knew we could sleep here, I would have brought some mattresses. Good night, everybody, sleep well. Excuse me. Rebecca. Rebecca. Rebecca where is Anderson? Rebecca. Anderson. Anderson. Anderson. Anderson. Oh, my God! Rebecca, Rebecca, wake up! Rebecca! Rebecca, wake up, come on, Rebecca! Let me sleep, Daisy. Wake up, Rebecca. I saw a ghost, Rebecca. You must be dreaming, Daisy. Rebecca, wake up, please. We got to get out of here. Get up! I saw a ghost, a ghost, Rebecca. Nope, Daisy, get back to sleep No, Rebecca, you do not understand. We gotta leave here. Anderson disappeared, Rebecca. Anderson is gone. Rebecca, I saw a ghost, this house is not normal. You are dreaming, Daisy. Rebecca, Anderson is not here. He is not here, Rebecca. We gotta get out of here. Daisy. Rebecca. - Rebecca. - Daisy. Rebecca. Where is Anderson? I don't know, I don't know. We gotta find him. We gotta get out of here, Rebecca. Yes, we gotta find him. No. No, no, don't. No. No. Come on, Daisy. No. Rebecca. Help me, Daisy. Help me. Help me. Help me, I am hurt. Help me. Help me. Daisy. Rebecca. Daisy! Rebecca... Calm down, Daisy. Anderson. What is going on? Calm down. Anderson, take me away from here, please. Calm down, where is Rebecca? Rebecca? Rebecca? Anderson. There is something wrong with this house. Give me your cell. Nope, also no signal. No, please, take me out of here. Listen, I will, but I need to get back to pick Rebecca up. Come with me. Calm down. Calm down. Hush little baby, don't say a word, Mama's gonna buy you a mockingbird. And if that mockingbird won't sing, Mama's gonna buy you a diamond ring. What happened to her? And if that diamond ring turns to brass, Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass. Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat. Come Daisy, come. Rebecca. Rebecca! Why doesn't she come? I don't know. Rebecca, let's go! No. No. Rebecca. Anderson, let's get out of here, please. You look for Rebecca later. No Daisy, we have to take Rebecca, then we leave. Calm down. This looks like a maze. Come with me. I don't, I don't want to go anymore. I don't, Anderson. No. No, come on, come with me. Let's get out of here. Wait. Anderson. Anderson. Anderson. I declare you... ...husband... ...and wife. Son, you may kiss the bride. Daisy. You are inside my soul, together with all the souls I have absorbed by magic, my dark side came back to life. It feeds itself with souls, our body has not gone to the forgetting lake yet, get back to life, destroy the red stone, save the souls, and make me free of this prison.
