[upbeat guitar music] Anna, how long? Just a few more miles. Surely like reading your book? [ominous music] [horse whinnies, man exclaims] [somber music] [woman sobbing] [upbeat guitar folk country music] [somber music] Welcome to Rancho Lane, may it ever be so humble. I'm Marcie. I've heard much about you, thanks for taking in Cheryl. The Birtwick's gave us a lot of business over the years, we're just glad we can help. She's got sadness lines in her face since the last time I saw her. [horse whinnying] I have a hunch you're gonna get bored here, I know I am. Bored, not boring. How is Cheryl holding up? Not good. Three years ago she's a spoiled little girl living the life of a princess, then her mother dies of cancer and her father dies in a riding accident. Now instead of a family she's got a trust fund and a bunch of attorneys like me. She's confused and angry, completely disconnected. So you brought her to a horse ranch? She's afraid of horses but more than that she's afraid of life. So you want her to get back in the saddle. I couldn't have put it any better. So how do you know so much about girls? I read. Women's magazines? My dad used to say that's the only way you can learn about girls, so I pick up whatever we have lying around the house Even some of grandpa's old books. An old western novel, written a long time ago. Cowboys and Indians. You ever read a western? No, just women's magazines and the occasional catalogue. You can learn a lot about American character from a western. My friend felt 5,000 dollars a month would cover Cheryl's expenses. $15,000 for the first three months. Oh we'll treat Cheryl as one of our own, we don't need your money. We don't have many expenses anyway. Cheryl might. I pay the bills around here Mr., and we've got plenty of them. Thank you. Now it's time you met the rest of the family. Dewelen's king, thinks he's king of the cowboys and the other one's our mare Queen. Queen? Yea. Queen of the cowboys, king and queen of the cowboys. Don't you get it? No. Your education in American pop culture is sadly lacking. [horse neighing and whinnying] [ominous music] Now it's time you met the baby of the bunch. [whistles] [dramatic music] [horse whinnying] He's a bit of a comedian. He's beautiful. We call him black beauty. [somber music] The mayor calls it imminent domain, I call it stealing. This ranch sits on free land that settled and developed by ranchers and farmers oh 100-150 years ago. My ancestors gave their blood and sweat for this old dirt and now the mayor wants to grab it. He's the local land baron. He's already bought up or stolen most of the ranches around and mine is the last and biggest on his list. I'll have my office check with the bar association, maybe we can find you a good attorney. All I need is my rifle and a friendly judge. [pensive music] [car starts] [dramatic music] Hi, Beauty. [pensive music] Black Beauty, why yes I think that is a very good name. If you like it it shall be his name, and so it was. When John went into the stable he told James that master and mistress had chosen a good sensible English name for me. They mean something. [disconcerting music] [ominous music] [horse whinnying] Do you have any plans today Cheryl? Carey you can show her around the ranch. I thought you wanted me to work foreman today? Oh I'll keep an eye on things. [Country folk guitar music] - Thanks. - Yea, I'll catch you later. Sheriff! A moment of your time, how you liking the new job, son? I like it here mayor, always have. Well good, good. Well listen I understand you might have some influence with the Lane family. Is that true? I wouldn't call it influence mayor, our families are close but it was a long time ago. Well my family was close to the Lanes back in the day, before Time Lane's daddy got my father sent to prison. He died there of course and we lost our farm, that uh... Before I was born mayor. Of course. Um do me a favor, see if you can use that influence of yours to get them folks to sell out to me. I'd like to do it fair and legal before I have to do it unfair-- And illegal. Never, well that'd be an abuse of the public trust. And so would having the Sheriff's office in the middle of a real estate dispute. Yes sir, you are right. But your job is between you and me... and you said you like it here. Let's hope you get a chance to stay awhile. [country guitar music] - Howdy, Tim. - Morning, Pete. I need me a small patch to grow some corn. Maybe a half acre, bad ground water from the mayor's ranch spoiled my early seed corn crop. Well take that farm corner patch, it should do just fine for ya. Twenty bucks down and $10 bucks a week. That ain't much for renting ground, Tim, you're not gonna make much money at them rates. I don't need much money. I ain't taking charity. Oh it's not charity, I make a little profit and you get your seed corn. Thanks, Tim. It's been a hard year. Alright now go on and get to work and say hello to your wife for me. - Will do. - Ok. Smell that fresh air. I smell fertilizer, Sheriff. I grew up here. It's good to be back. I thought farmers use tractors and stuff. I didn't know they got down on their hands and knees, or are those just the workers? Just the workers? No, those are people just like us. This is a poor town, locals can barely afford grain for their animals let alone fuel for their tractors. I didn't know. Without their equipment they can't harvest the fields or sell enough crops to keep their homes. So grandpa rents his fields real cheap and they grow a little extra food. We even give them a free lunch, helps a little bit I guess, helps us keep our place too. I just don't know for how long. Is that the Sheriff over there watching? I don't know if he's watching the workers or if he's watching for my mom. He's her old high school boyfriend. Really? C'mon I wanna show you something. Alright boys that's lunch. Get it before it melts! Sooner or later you're gonna have to go down there and you're gonna have to say hello to Miss Marcie. You know as a courtesy. I'm afraid she'll just slap my face... as a courtesy. Well whatever you're gonna, make it fast. Mayor wants this property. He's gonna get it. [tense music] [pensive music] Careful. [upbeat music] Wow. My secret garden. Grandpa showed it to me, said he used to like to bring girls up here. No westerns today? No, just plenty of blood thirsty violence. Let me see that. It's about a horses whole life, Black Beauty. Anna Sewell wrote it in 1877, point of view of the horse, right? Yea. I read it in grade school after I saw the movie. Well one of them anyway, they only made like 10,000 versions of it. It's a good chick book. Chick book? Yea, you know girl falls in love with a horse, horse in danger, separated, tearful reunion, all that good stuff. You wanna trade? No, too scary. Carey? Yea? What are you afraid of? Nothing. Be serious. I was afraid we'd lose all our money when the economy went bad... and we did. I was afraid we'd lose our home and it looks like we might. And I was afraid I'd never see my dad again when he moved into the city and took that factory job. And I never did. He was killed by a drunk driver. Well what I mean is it doesn't help to be afraid. Bad things still com whether you're scared or not. I guess you know something about that. Yea. [sweet music] He's beautiful. And in another few weeks he'll be out in the fields working with the other horses... my grandpa will sell him and he'll be working somebody else. Well strength in spirit. He needs to be able to fling up his head and toss his tail and Gallup when he wants to. You wanna ride him? It's been a long time since I've ridden bareback. Well just take it easy and you'll be fine. Are you ready? [upbeat music] - Good boy, Beauty. - Alright grab his mane. [ominous music] [whinnying] [both laughing] Hey Beauty. Carey! Carey, say the blessing please. God is good, God is great, good God it's time we ate! Carey. He learned that from me. I hear Cheryl did some riding today. - She did, on what? - Black Beauty. Oh. Until she got thrown off. You let her get thrown? - She's ok. - Are you sure? My butt hurts. Oh. Well I'll tell you what, ok, tomorrow just be with Beauty and play with her. Just have some fun, ok? [country music] [knocking] Jeff. You still look as pretty as I remember. Tim. You must be Carey, I've seen you around town. And this is Cheryl, a family friend visiting from the east coast. I've just been in town myself for a few weeks. So I thought I'd stop by and say hello. You here to help the mayor run us out of house and home? [Marcie] Tim, please. I'm here because they offered my a job, Tim. I just got tired of that big city life. That's not what I heard, I heard the big city got tired of you. I'm sorry, Jeff. No, it's ok. I just thought I'd stop by and say hello to my old friends. I'll walk you out. [Jeff] Tell your father-in-law to be careful of what he says, especially about the mayor. Not a chance. They've hated each other for 40 years and I don't think he'd take kindly to a warning from you. Yea, I know. Everybody's heard something about me. Do be honesty with you I didn't try to keep up with the news. I've had enough troubles of my own. Yea, I heard about Michael... I'm sorry, he was a good man. He was a good man. That's why I married him. Whatever you've heard Marcie I gotta tell you something. Oh Pete you don't have to get into this. No, it's important. Back in the city I was working with some corrupt cops and I turned them in. They framed me, kicked me off the force. Big city police work just had a bad smell after that, at least in my precinct so... I came here. For the fresh air? Marcie, this town has that same smell. Be careful, and if you need anything, anything at all, you call. [country folk guitar music] [man] Alright. [woman] Let's go c'mon. Ok, he's ready. Go on. Go on. There you go. Good boy. Took that bit, that girl's easy. Isn't he? [country rock music] Good boy Beauty. Keep going. Good boy. There you go. C'mon Beauty. Good boy. Stay down. Ya. C'mon. C'mon, ya, c'mon! C'mon! C'mon boy. [all] Yea! Happy birthday! Help me blow out the candles. Alright! Yea! [woman] Ok, one more tape, follow me. [man] Yea, yea. [Marcie] There you go. Thank you. [Marcie] There you go. Yes, sir, yea. [Marcie] A big piece for you. Uh now folks... thank you all for coming. Thanks, now if you'll indulge me a moment of nostalgia. Let's go back to the days when the good guys rode horses and the bad guys rode scared. Roll it, Kirkie. [old time movie music] He likes to play his old movies on his birthday. He says it reminds him of when he was a kid on Saturday mornings at the hitching post. The what? The Hitching Post Theater, it's where grandpa used to watch old movies. I can still ride better than these tender-foots. Grandpa and his movies So what's your girlfriend's name? Us city girls don't beat around the bush. Don't have one. Why not? Don't you like girls? Oh I like girls alright but there aren't that many beautiful girls out here on the back 40. Till you showed up. Why that is a very good line. What book did you get that out of? Oh you know, "How to Dazzle Pretty Girls" by Carey Lane. You know what I think? I think you're scared. You may be right. But if I am? It's only when something good happens. [horse neighing] [both laugh] [Cheryl] That's cute. You brought a chaperone. [Carey laughs] Tim, there's a group of us that wanna stop the mayor from what he's doing. Damn near bought us all out and he's trying to scare the rest of us or starve us out. We got a right to raise our families on our land. We can wait him out, Pete. He'll quit eventually. If I know Bart Williams he'll try to scare us again but then he'll give up the ghost before long. He hasn't got the patience and we've got all the time in the world. Less than you think. This ain't no county business. I'm sorry to interrupt, I didn't come here to make trouble. Well why did you come? That's better said in private, Mr. Lane. These are my friends, you can say anything you want in front of them. It's the bank. The mayor just bought it and that means he has the note on your ranch. He's gonna foreclose and send me out here with a request to vacate. What do you mean foreclose? What note? Uh... I'm behind on the mortgage payment, Marcie. I needed some cash so I took out a second and I'm behind on it. How much? Oh almost 20,000. I'll cash in that check. [somber music] Marcie! Marcie, wait. I came here to warn you not to hurt you. I know. I know, it's just that I am so tired of fighting to keep this farm. I loved you once. And I loved you. I could feel it again. Save the romance for the kids, Jeff. Sooner or later everything dies. [Carey] So what's the story, Grandpa? Actually went and bought the bank so he can foreclose on the ranch. What about my trust fund? When I turn 18 I get plenty of money. I could ask the trustees. I'm afraid there isn't time. I've gotta think of something. [upbeat country guitar music] [mayor] Tell me you got bread pudding. [waitress] Yea, that's not our special, Harry. [mayor] I know, that's-- Hey, Stevie. ...all you ever have here. Add a cup of black coffee. [waitress] Alright, I'll get it right for ya. [mayor] Now. [waitress] Alright. [mayor wheeze laughs] Please apply this to our mortgage balance. Marcie Lane, what a wonderful surprise! Sorry but I really don't have time to chat. Well I don't know where you found the cash but I figure this is the last of it. I'm glad you brought the second mortgage up to date but uh... Whatever are you folks gonna eat on? [laughing] [dramatic music] [ominous music] [man] Well isn't she mighty fine. [country guitar music] Damn Lane woman managed to bring her mortgage up to date. Did you really think that by buying the bank you'd run the Lane's off the farm? Why not? All it takes is money. A little pressure applied in the right places... all legal of course. Yea, it's really a shame about those pesky banking laws. Just can't figure out where they got that cash. I gotta find another way. If I get the slightest whiff of anything illegal going on I'll be all over you. Do you really need that private army of goons? That ain't none of your business, if I were you I'd concentrate on my career. My sources tell me you need this job, bad. Perception Jeffbo, it's all about perception. Hi. Hi, there young lady. Good to see ya. [people chatting] [woman] I do like it. [man] Well now let's see here that is a mighty fine looking wash-up. Hi. Would you like an apple? I don't think so but I think Beauty might like it. [man] It's on the house. [ominous music] - Somebody help her. - Is she ok? That girl is one heck of a rider. [mayor] I'll say. That is one special horse. That's Black Beauty, Time Lane's barn. And the girl? Family friend. Maybe that's how they paid up the loan. That girl can ride. She's had training and that kind of training takes money. I got a ticket to write, mayor. Jeff, when you get me the Lane ranch I want that horse too. What are you doing? Just cleaning up the old 12-gauge. You're not planning anything stupid? No. Look, don't worry. Just gotta keep it in good shape. Be careful. [man] That's not gonna work for me. Wilford, we asked the Lane's to help us with Cheryl and now Cheryl's asking us to help. As executors of the Birtwick estate we did not ask the Lane's for anything, we paid them. A very tidy sum as I recall, for a simple babysitting job. Anything more would be a slap in the face to the late Birtwicks. It's our job to protect the estate. It is our job to protect Cheryl. I think these people are good for her and if she says they need help then we give it to them. Let me remind you that Cheryl is not yet of age, she has no control over her trust fund until she turns 18 and if it is my perception... our perception, that she is unwilling or unable to handle the estate in a mature manner-- You can't keep it from her. The subject is closed, I agree we need to protect Cheryl, this time it appears we need to protect her from herself. [ominous music] [somber music] [knocking] [Marcie] Carey, where's Tim? How should I know. He was with you. I haven't seen him all day. Marcie, it appears your boy hurt his leg. I was looking for bait, Mom, and I fell into the culvert at Fort Daniels road. The mayor here said some of his men were attacked on that same road. Apparently some of my men were involved in a shooting. So I came out with the Sheriff to try and get to the bottom of this, I sure hope Carey here was not a part of that rabble. Now some of my men could have been seriously injured by these troublemakers. Marcie, would you have Time get in touch with us, maybe clue us in before somebody else is hurt. Well, we'll leave you now, mayor. Yea, I'll be out in a minute. Tell me about Black Beauty. What about him? Well he's one hell of a special horse. - I'd like to buy him. - He's not for sale. He's happy here, he has his freedom here. Young woman, here ain't gonna be here for much longer. I don't think you folks can afford a place in the city where you can keep a horse. But I'd sure give you a fair price, think about it. If your men started this shooting-- My men didn't start anything! Nick would have. What about Nick? Nothing. Is he on your payroll? Everybody's on my payroll Jeff, let's go. Carey, what is going on? There is blood on your pants! Grandpa’s back at Elm's Creek, Mom, he's been shot. What happened? We were meeting in the woods, Grandpa drove and the mayor's goons attacked us. A few men were shot. We shot back. They blew out the tires on the truck and Grandpa was hit in the leg. We escaped and took off on foot, you know me helping Grandpa along but when I twisted my ankle he told me to take off and go get help. I'll go. I'll take Beauty. You don't know where to go. You said Elm's Creek, right? That's at the end of Fort Daniel's road right where we ran into the mayors goons, I could find it again. Besides, you can't ride with that ankle. No, I'll go myself. We have to get Tim here fast and the one thing I do well is ride well, so let me go. Mom... she's right. Be careful. I'll get Doc Chavez. [tense music] C'mon Beauty, let's go. [dramatic tense music] Tim? Tim? Cheryl! Tim! Are you ok? I'm ok... Ow... I just got this whole in my leg is all. Do you think you could ride? There's never been a day when I couldn't ride, darlin'. Just help me up. Ok. [tense music] [somber music] [guitar music enters] Marcie! Ok, hold on! Oh it's good seeing you. Alright, I'm here for you, be careful. Be careful. Ok, watch the leg. Watch the leg. Ok, ok, let me take him. Alright. Carey, get Beauty into his stall now, we're gonna get him inside. [Tim] Careful. C'mon. C'mon Beauty. That does smart a bit, Doc. Well once you fall asleep you won't feel a thing, you need to sleep. Well there's not much work around here gonna get done with me asleep. Listen to me you crazy old man, if you're not careful you're not gonna live to be shot again. I'll see to that personally. Marcie, this is what I want you to do. You're gonna change his dressing twice a day and whatever you do, please please get him to stay off his feet. Thank you. Don't thank me, thank your house guest and her horse. It's the only reason this grumpy old man is still alive to torture us. Marcie, top left drawer there, the bureau, there's a wad of bills. No, no, no, it's fine, I'm not gonna take your money. You took a bullet for this town it's the least I can do. I wish we could give him some water. We can't, it could kill him. C'mon, let's go. We've done all we can. [ominous music] [dramatic music] [Carey] Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom! [shallow breathing] [Carey] He's burning up. [Marcie] He's got a fever for sure. Good boy, it's ok. Carey, did you let him drink water? No Mom, I did everything right, just like Grandpa taught me. I know you did the best you could. Carey, what's wrong? Black Beauty's in trouble. Carey, wait! Hi. Why does he sound like that? Bad inflammation in his lungs. Hurts him terribly to breath. Will he die? I don't know. His fever is very high, all we can do now is try to keep him comfortable. I rode him too hard. You didn't have a choice. None of us did. I was in a horse race the day when Mom died. [somber music] And I was on a horse when my dad had his accident. And no matter how hard or how fast I rode... I couldn't do anything to save either one of them. Maybe by trying to get your Grandpa I was trying to do it again. You were trying to save his life... you did... end of story. Thanks. I've been wanting to tell you, I'm sorry I got Carey into danger. We didn't know they were gonna attack us. I know. I guess I'm getting old, I'm starting to make mistakes but... sometimes you gotta fight for what you believe in. That could be a good lesson for a boy to learn. Not staring down the barrel of a gun. Not at 16 years old. Our family has been fighting with the Williams our whole life. I know, it's hard to believe that Bart and me were friends when we were kids. But his father, Jack, was my Pa's biggest rival and this Jack was a nasty man. He was mean, he was a thief, he was a liar. Treated his own family like dirt. All he loved was money. Like father like son. Well I don't know about that but when Bart was about 15 old Jack decided he wanted to drive my pa out of business. So he started killing off our horses. Pa caught him, they had a fight like you've never seen. Right over in that field behind that oak. Who won? Pa naturally, he could anybody's butt. He had a fast left hook, just like me. After that was over Jack went off to prison, he died there, somebody knifed him. He picked a fight with the wrong group of guys in there. Bart blames your dad. That's sad that he blames your father for the pain his own dad caused him. Well we just have to keep fighting for what's right, that's all. You don't wanna give up do you? No. I don't. But I'd like to relax a little, live a little. I love this land. I'm just sick of fighting to keep it. [country guitar music] Now let me get this straight, you opened fire on local residents. You told the boys to shake 'em up a little. No, I told all of you to follow them, see if they had a meeting in place! Somebody could have been killed! Yea us! Heck that old man had a shotgun! Just lucky for us I saw it. Old man, what old man? Tim Lane. Well he ain't an old man. Same age as me. Wait a minute, you shot Tim Lane? No, I just winged him. Did he see you? Recognize you? Hell no them boys was running like the wind. He was a friend of mine once. What are you talking about? You hate that guys guts. I wanna take his ranch fair and square but I ain't gonna kill him for it. Now you listen to me punk, I'm not a murderer. But if you ever step foot in this town again I might just become one. Make sure he leaves. [somber music] [upbeat music] Hi, how are you? Oh let's see, I'm nursing a horse and a crazy old man. How is Tim? He'll recover. Thanks for keeping our secret. I never would have said anything, but I am still trying to figure out what happened. I figured as much. And I don't believe a handful of farmers are responsible. I don't really care who's responsible, I just want it to stop. I could help you raise your son, get him into good schools, college. Are you trying to bribe me sheriff? No, just marry you. [dramatic music] It seems the psychological experiment on Cheryl has had dire consequences. According to my sources the Lanes have become embroiled in some sort of battle with local authorities. Apart from the danger it entails for Cheryl it puts the reputation of the entire estate at risk. Do you want me to go out there and see what's going on? I want you to go out there and get Cheryl and put her on a plane back home. There's a local boarding school that's agreed to take her on early prior to the start of next semester. You really think the best thing for her is to isolate her in some dormer? She's in danger, I find it helps to think of her less as a person and more as an asset of the estate. My job is to protect estate assets from harm or injury, so is yours, so get to work. [somber music] Shh shh shh. Whoa. Whoa. Ok, Beauty. We know you will. [tender music] [whinnies] [upbeat music] Mom! Grandpa, come quick! Hurry up, Tim. [whinnies] That-ta boy. That-ta boy. Yea. Yea. You see his fevers gone now we keep giving him electrolytes and maybe it won't come back. I'll go get some corn. He's gonna be fine darlin', he's gonna be fine but you just give him some light, light, light exercise he needs time to heal. I'll take good care of him. That-ta boy, here. Like candy to him. His favorite thing in the world. Here. Hold on, hold on, don't feed him it all at once. You know hold that and let him break it off in his mouth. There you go! You love this horse, don't you? I love all the animals. I love animals. I wanna be a veterinarian, that's what my dad wanted to be. How come he never did it? He ran outta time I guess. It's hard. You know to love. I can remember loving so much it felt like my heart was stuffed. You know just loving everything. My parents... the way the grass felt. Just like anything. And then it all went away. I miss feeling that. That's why you gotta keep on loving. Because it can go away. You gotta hold on tight to the things you love and to the things that you find to love. Maybe if you hold on tight enough, some of those things won't go away. We won't go too far, ok? Beautiful day for a ride. - Come on. - Come on! [upbeat music] Goons. What? Mayor's men. We must be on some more of his land. I thought this was the Johnson ranch. A good morning to both of ya. Good morning, mayor. And here we have Black Beauty out for a morning stroll. Well you don't have to be afraid of me. We aren't afraid. We just don't like you. Well that's a smart mouth on a little boy. Maybe your hide ain't been tanned since your daddy died. Try it. I can't wait for you to grow up boy. Why wait. Sure would like to see that horse run. How about a little private race? Your Beauty against my SUV. Hah, against a truck? Why not? He'll have the advantage. I gotta stick to the road, just a few hundred yards or so. You're nuts. What's in it for us if we win? What do you want? Money? Tell you what, we'll do a little race here. You win I'll make you a proposition. About Tim's ranch, maybe a way to save it. What do you think? Alright. Once around that clump of trees and then back. Careful. Hell look at the both of you. Isn't that sweet. [laughing] Are we gonna stand around here and talk all day, or are we gonna race? On your mark, get set, go! Ya! [men cheering] Yea, go get 'em, c'mon! C'mon Cheryl. [man] Yea, c'mon! [mayor] Ah, cut me off at the tree. Good boy Beauty. You did it, Cheryl. - Well you ride beautifully. - Thank you. And now for your part of the bargain? Alright. I propose a race, a public race. You on Beauty against a rider and horse of my own choosing. You mean a steeple chase? I mean an old fashioned country race, start off in town, through the woods and back. Who knows, you may even win. Not necessarily, I don't know the terrain. What are the stakes? Well if you win I'll tear up the note on the Lane ranch. And they live in peace. And if I lose? The ranch is mine. Of course I'll let the Lane's stay on as tenants. Renters on our own property? Well it'll be my property. How about a third option? You take a note against my trust fund to pay off the ranch, payable when I hit 18. No way! Nah, race for the ranch, take it or leave it. She'll take it. Excellent. Mayor. Yea? You could lose. Why are you willing to take the risk? [country guitar music] Maybe a spirit of healthy competition. Or maybe because an old friend of mine took a bullet. Never should of happened. [men chatting] Maybe you're right. Maybe things have gotten out of hand. You got the power to change it. I know. But that's what makes it so difficult. You know I really love this town. It's why I've always been so damn power mad. I grew up here too. At least for awhile. So I started buying up all this property. If these people can't make a go of it, let 'em leave! They can sell out to me and at least no outsider is gonna come in and change things. If I own it, I can keep it just the way I like it. So you end up alone, with a town full of empty building? At least it'll look the way I remember it. Besides I'm not trying to force anyone to leave. Except the Lanes. I sure wish you drank, Sheriff. Work days over, let's talk a little horse flesh. Black Beauty. Sure. Curious, Mayor, what would you do if you owned Black Beauty? Train him, race him, then send him out to stud and make another small fortune. But I don't think that's gonna happen. God, it used to be such fun. Being one of the good guys is fun. Competition is competition. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're right. I won't go. You don't have any choice. They've got a private plane waiting for you in the city. I thought you people worked for me. It's complicated, we're supposed to do what's best for you. But this is my family now. Is taking me away from them what's best for me? Maybe, maybe someday you'll understand. Do you understand it now? No, I don't... but I don't know what to do. Oh uh... what about... a divorce? A divorce? Well what do they call it when a kid gets divorced from the parent? Emancipation. Ok, Emancipation, well in your legal opinion, could a 16 year old kid get emancipated from an abusive parent? Of course, well then surely she could get emancipated from an abusive trustee. A with the help of a good lawyer, right? I'll take the job, but if you go to war with the trust fund we won't be able to get a dime till this is all over. What about the bet with Mayor Williams? I won't be able to pay off the note if I lose the race. Well that's easy. You'll just have to win. [somber music] What would happen if you lost the ranch? What would happen to the horses? We might be able to afford to board them, if not Queen's too old to sell. She's barn sour so she can't do much else but hangout. King, he's too independent, I mean we might be able to get one of the big ranches to take him for free... if not... he might end up a killer. A killer? What's a killer? Those are the horses who get killed off to make cat food and glue and stuff like that. Black Beauty, he's worth a lot of money. We could sell him. I hope to good people. So many different kinds. Some good... some bad. Mostly bad. Good people make good horses. There are a great many kind of men. Some good... thoughtful men who any horse would be pleased to serve. Then there's cruel, bad men... never ought to have a horse or a dog to call their own. That's from my book. Black Beauty. A horse never knows who's gonna buy him or who's gonna drive him. Do your best Black Beauty. Do your best. And me too. Please, God, let me do my best. [tuning guitar] [people talking in background] Did you make it? Thank you. I love it. - How much are they? - Here you go. - Looking forward to the race? - Yea. Who you root for? Cheryl of course. Ah he was just a little pig. Hey, Mom look, there's Jeff. Morning. I'm gonna go find Cheryl. I'll uh... leave you two alone. Well whatever happens, happens. - Oh morning, Bart. - Morning, Tim. Looks like you're dressed for racing. I aim to win today. Even if it means breaking my neck to do it. Oh you'll do ok, you always were hell in a saddle. Sorry about your leg, Tim. Heck I'm sorry about a lot of things. I always figured that deep down you always knew how things were, you knew what your father was really like, I mean you had to live with him. It wasn't easy. Well... my home has always been open to you and yours, always will be. Even if I lose? Especially if you lose, if you win I might have to find a new place to live. Grandpa, Cheryl's gone. What do you mean she's gone, where? Uh the secret garden I think. Let's get the truck. [sad ominous music] Alright darlin', what's going on? I don't think I can do it. I don't think I can win. Of course you can win. Sometimes you get afraid to try, that happens to me all the time. No, there's just too much at stake, I should have never made that bet. I've seen a lot of riders in my day and you're one of the great ones. I don't feel very great. A good old friend once told me, that greatness is seizing opportunity. You grab it with your hands and you hold on until your knuckles show white. That's what you gotta do today, the rest will come easy. Now c'mon, Beauty doesn't know where you are, c'mon. Thanks. Let's go. [country folk guitar] [man in crowd] Ok, Cheryl, go get 'em! Champion, meet Black Beauty. May the best horse win. [Cheryl] Whoa, easy Beauty. You're just in time. [tense dramatic music] You can do it, honey. Mayor, Cheryl. [mayor] Ya! Go! [crowd cheering] C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. [people cheering] C'mon, c'mon! Yea! [Carey] Yea! Go Cheryl! [woman] Cheryl! [dramatic music] Ya. Ya. [mayor] C'mon here, move it, c'mon! Let's go. [Cheryl] Ya. [mayor] C'mon, ya, ya, ya! C'mon! [tense music] How do you think it's going? [upbeat dramatic sweeping music] C'mon! [mayor] Ya! Ya! [Cheryl] Ya! C'mon! - Ya! - Ya! [fast paced modern country music] [mayor] You ain't gonna catch me! C'mon, c'mon! Ya, ya, ya! C'mon, c'mon, let's get 'em. Ha! You think you can do it, huh? Ha, ha! [Cheryl] Ya! [mayor] Let's go! Ah yea, let's go! C'mon! [dramatic tense music] [people cheering] C'mon Beauty! C'mon Beauty! Woo! [crowd cheering] Yes! [pensive upbeat horn music] Sure enough. Whoa, good boy. - Hey. - Hey. Oh I knew you could do it. Well Bart, you lost. Yea it was still a good day. Now listen, that little girl's got a big fight on her hands... she's got a good attorney but she's got no war chest. Well maybe I can help. Well there's a lot of things we should talk about. Well maybe you ought a invite me over for dinner. Well maybe we ought a go get our fishing poles and go catch us a dinner. Just like old times? Just like old times. [people] Wooo! [laid back country folk rock music] I can't believe it's over. It's been a rough year for you, hasn't it? How long were we in court? Two months. Lawyers. But you won, you got complete control of your family fortune. I'd give it all up to have a family again. Welcome back. - Hi. - Come give me a hug. Sweetheart. Hi. [lawyer] Hi. Hi, oh we missed you darlin'. Oh I missed you too. -Hey -Hey. - I missed you. - Me too. [Jeff] Cheryl, take a look. [regal music] Black Beauty's gonna be so excited to see you. We all are. I'm just so happy to be home. You call this home? It just took me awhile to find it. [mayor] I learned a lot from Black Beauty that day and that horse is still winning races. He's got a son now. Another champion. Which proves that there's good in each of us. And if we're lucky we get to pass it on. [heartfelt music]
