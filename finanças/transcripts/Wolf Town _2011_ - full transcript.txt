We called it--Paradise when we first came here. We'd hoped that's what we'd found when we discovered what we came lookin' for. Gold. But, that was before, Oh, shit! Shit. Shit. Oh, fuck it. Hey man. No no no. I'm in the car right now. Yeah. No, I'll be there in five minutes. Just a second. Get out of the road. Get out of the road! Yeah I know, dude. The traffic is just-- it's crazy right now. I'll be there in five minutes, I promise. Alright? Oh, looks like someone's in need of some serious therapy. And, as usual, you're late. Well, time, as you know, is a myth perpetuated by society. Not a convention I conform to. Right right, well I am a conformist who wants to graduate from college. Should be studying for my finals right now, but I'm here as your wingman because you're too much of a pussy to ask Jess out by yourself. I know, and I love you for it. Yeah, yeah. God damn, I can't believe I overslept. You think she's already gone? Why don't you just chill out? Why don't you use this time to give me this bullshit story I'm supposed to stick to for this harebrained trip? What do you mean? I told you the plan yesterday. Look, we're going to that old abandoned ghost town up north called Paradise. It's part of a school research project. And Jess is going because, you know, she's a history and anthropology major so she can maybe try to figure out how and why the place became a ghost town. And then, I'm going because-- You're an idiot? So, I'm here, why? What's my excuse for this crazy trip? Ugh. Geology? Right? I mean, you think there might be gold in the town and so you wanna come and check it out. What? You told her I'm hunting for gold? I didn't know what else to say. You make me sound like a complete jackass. I'm sorry, it was the only thing I could think of. Dude! You're an asshole. This is just so insane. What, so you think that this is crazy? Yeah. I think you've been staring at this girl for the past eight months. You're too uptight to do anything about it. So you come up with this idiot scheme to drag her out to the middle of nowhere in the hope she's gonna somehow succumb to your charms? Yeah, how dare I even think of using the word “crazy” to describe you. Fuck you, man. You're not helping. Right, right. I just thought this was the easiest thing. You're going. Real nice. Real nice, Kyle. Ben, come on, man. Don't make me go by myself. Yeah. What are we gonna do when she gets in the car and she sees there's no mining tools? Mining tools? What tools do you need for mining gold? / Don't know. Like a hammer and a pick? Okay, dude, first off: we're not really mining for gold. / Made that up. When she gets in the car and sees there's no tools, she's gonna figure that one out, dumbass. You're stressing me out. Please just be cool, man. Just play along. Just this once. "What's up, Jess? I'm hunting for gold." Dude, I'm fucking begging you. Just stop. Please. You like this girl, huh? I just hope she shows up. I think she will. Hey. Look, when she gets here, do you mind gettin' in the back seat? What? Please? Unbelievable. From shotgun to third-wheel in one easy step? Please? I'm not gonna make her sit back there, come on. Please? Fine. Fine. Thank you. I'm not gonna smile about it. Alright, that's fine. Just be nice. I'm nice. I'll be nice. You be nice. I will. Ohhh. Hey. Hi guys. Hope we didn't keep you waiting too long. Who the fuck is this guy? Yeah sorry. It's kinda hard draggin' this one outta bed. Shut up. Hi, Kyle. Hey. This is Rob. Hi. And it's Ben, right? Yeah, yeah. Hey, how's it goin'? Rob. Hey. Cool, cool. So. Yeah. Okay, so, bags? You can throw your bags in here. Great. Thank you. Thanks, dude. Kyle. Oh hey, we'll take the back seat. I mean-- Yeah. Totally. Thank you. Sure. I can scoot forward if you want. Oh, no. So, gentlemen. How long's it supposed fo take to get there? A few hours. A few hours. You are aware that in a few hours instead, we could be in Las Vegas having a really good-- Stop it. You are so bad. Nope. Let's go. Yes, let's. Can't wait. Ah! Free gold! So. What's the story, Rob? The story? Yeah, you know. You like a football team guy or a-- what's your deal? No, I actually blew out my knee in high school, so kind of gave up on sports as the path to fame and fortune. Shit. That sucks, right? So what do you do instead? I'm studying discreet math. What the fuck is discreet math? It's one of the dull sides of software development. Holy shit, dude, he's a computer geek, just like you. I mean, no offense. Shit! What's wrong, Kyle? I think we missed the turn-off. So where exactly are we going? Paradise. It's an old mining town from the California gold rush. Now it looks like some kind of ghost town. Somebody steal your town? No, it's a little ways further in if you're still interested. Why wouldn't we be? Yeah, we drove all this way out here. Yeah, man. What's the plan? Well there's a-- There's a-- There's an old gold mine--somewhere. Yeah, it's about a half-mile in... that direction. Let's go. We'll catch up with you guys in a second. You're being such a dick right now. I'm being a dick? What about the whole little car ride chit chat with Rob? Oh, what's the story, man? It's cool. Blah blah. What do you want me to do? Sit in complete silence like you for four hours? Fuck. What am I even doing here? What the fuck are any of us even doing here? Could you just keep your voice down? This is all your stupid idea just 'cause you're too much of a pussy to ask Jess out! Nice. - Yeah, it is nice. Now you're just pissed ‘cause big Rob had the balls to do what you couldn't. Screw this, Kyle. Around the corner? I don't know. Look at this thing. Crazy contraption. Whoa. Check it out. I've been on this ride. - Cool. Yeah, it's got the two loops and reverses at the end. This is where they take the tickets. Let's just go back. No way, I wanna check it out. I was kidding. That's rad. Knock knock. Hello? Fucking stupid trip, Kyle. God damn bullshit. What can I do for you? Well, my doctor says I have high cholesterol, so do you have any vegan food? Yes, no burgers here. Mmm! We have veggie patties. That sounds golden. Yep. Ahhh! God damn, that's good. Oh, Jesus. Ben? Let's go find some gold. Yes. Probably not. Wait, you think it's safe in there? Only one way to find out. Excuse me, Rob. Anybody comin'? Yeah, no! Knock yourself out, geology boy. Gonna need a flashlight? Do you have one? No. Well, then be careful. Yeah, obviously! Ah! Ooh, shit! Are you okay? Yeah. Damn it. We rich? What? From gold mine? Is that funny, Rob? Nah, I was just sayin' “Are we rich?” No, we're not rich. Shit. Shit. You guys, I just saw a wolf. A wolf? Yeah, right up there. Oh come on, you didn't see a wolf. No, I did. It was right up there. Do you even know the difference between a wolf and a coyote? No. Exactly. Hey, where you guys goin'? Listen, guys, enough's enough. I mean we still have enough time to go home. Maybe head back to town. Let's go to Vegas. Let's do something fun. Alright? No! We can't leave. Why? We spent all this time fo come up here and we're not gonna see the town? Come on, Kyle, this was your idea. This is your trip. You should take the lead. Alright. Alright. Lead the way. How much further we goin'? It's like a mile up the road. It's like a 16-mile hike already. Dude, relax. The car's right there. We've been running down hills like fucking pussies because of a quote unquote, wolf. Please shut up. I mean how do you know it wasn't a coyote? I wouldn't be runnin' down the hill saying you saw a fuckin' wolf. Dude, I did see a wolf! Fuck you. Did you guys see a wolf? No. Yeah, I didn't think so. Oh, this looks really cool. Not. Can we pop the trunk really quick? Sure. Great. Come on. Check it out? You're scared. He's got a sense of humor too. You're scared. Wow. I think you should shut the hell up. Wow, Kyle. This place is amazing! What's its history? Well, that's actually what kind of makes this place interesting. See, a bunch of 49ers came here and supposedly found gold. But then a year later, this whole place was just a ghost town. Whoa. I mean that's not a mystery. I mean, people came, didn't find gold. Or didn't find enough, and then picked up sticks and left. Oh come on! Where's your sense of wonder and romance? I think you need to be a little more open to things. That's cool and all, Jess. But you know how it goes. You find a dull, boring answer to a problem and that's probably it. Right. Like math. Suit yourselves. You're right, Jess. Let's explore your ghost town; find some romance. It's coming! You happy now? I mean this whole clusterfuck is your fault. And now I just--ah. I don't even know what to say anymore. The thing to do would just be to quit. This place sucks. Fuck this man. Hey, hey. Where you going? Who the fuck knows? Alright great, yeah. Go have another walk. I will, thanks. Fuck off. Fuckin' dick. Dick. Hello? Hey. This place is amazing. Where's Ben? He's just lookin' around outside. Did you guys find anything interesting? Nope. Are you kidding? This whole place is interesting. Anyone want a drink? Whatcha got? Well, by the looks of things... dust. Not a whole lot more. I'm good. It's a good thing that happens to be my favorite. Well then, here ya go. Let's see. There we go. He ain't havin' any. Woo! Woo-ee! How ‘bout another? Pretty little cowgirl like you? I suppose I'll take another. To us. I've got dust in my mouth. That's not too smart now, is it? That's some strong dust! Kyle, I'm here walkin' by myself in the Goddamn forest. Stupid bastard. Real funny, Kyle! Look if you've come to apologize, then just apologize. Stop screwin' around, alright, man? What an idiot. “Come on this freakin' trip, Ben. "It's gonna be a great time." Oh, real cute, Kyle. Real cute. Look, just apologize, man. Stop screwin' around. Idiot. Dragging me on this fuckin' stupid trip. I don't even know why. Stop playing games, man! What the fuck? Fuck. Shit! If you guys really wanna strike it rich, what we should do is salvage some of the iron from those railroad ties, and sell them fo a recycling center. Make a little bit of money. No. Alright well, good luck finding gold. Whoa, hey... Move. I'm tryin' to. Hey. Careful. You don't know what's in there. There's only one way to find out. I've just got to-- Did you find something? Yeah, I think I've got something. Is it alive? No. It's not moving. So it's not alive. Haha, your faces! Yeah, really really funny, Jess. You know, if you ever really need me to save you, you probably shouldn't be crying wolf now. What? You wouldn't come rescue me if / needed it? Yeah, I would. No. Get out of here. So what is this? Reach around. Yeah. You feel it? Yeah. I don't know. If we just move this piece, maybe we can-- Yeah, yeah, push that way. Okay, ready? It's like a journal. Or a diary maybe? Yeah. Should we read it? Yeah. God. "We called it Paradise when we first came here. "We'd hoped that's what we'd found "when we discovered what we came lookin' for. Gold." Oh. This thing must be over like 100 years old. Or, some college freshman put it here to fool impressionable... really cute young girls. I told you you needed to be more open to things. This is a piece of history. Real history. Hey! Hey. Hey! Hey! What? Oh my God! Is he? Ben. Ben. Fucking shit. We need to call someone. Yeah. Jesus. Shit, no service. Jess, what about your phone? It's in my bag, in the car. Alright, Kyle. Help me. Should we even move him? Yeah, as opposed to leaving him here in the streets? I suppose maybe we should bring him to a hospital. Come on. Grab him by the shoulder. Lift him back. Then get under. Alright, buddy. We're gonna lift you. One, two, thr- Fuck! Alright. I know it hurts. Listen, we're gonna get you help. We need your help on this one. We're gonna take you home. We'll get you help. Fuck! Alright, buddy. We're at the car. Be careful. Be careful. Easy. Easy. Alright? It's gonna be okay. I gotta set you down. I gotta get you in the seat. The keys. Get the keys. Hurry. Fuck. Watch your head. Pick him up! I got him. I'll get him. 11 get him. I'll get him. Come here, Ben. Ben. Fuck! Fuck. Shit. Shit. Shit. Be careful, Jess. Be careful. Help! Start the car! I can't! It won't! Fuck! What the fuck?! The wires are missing! What do you mean? Someone's busted the fucking wires! What, you can't re-connect them? No, they won't reach! There's fucking a piece missing. Fuck! Jess, your cell phone. Grab your cell phone. Grab your cell phone, babe. No, it was right here. It was in my bag. My bag was right here. You sure we--? I got it out of the trunk and then I put it right here. Yeah, you're right. Do you have a first aid kit? Anything like that? No, nothing. Not even in the trunk? You have nothing? No. What are we gonna do? What the fuck is goin' on out here? Alright. Help me. Shit. Wait a minute. Where are we going? We're going back to town. Come on. Help me. Come on. Come on. Fuck. Come on. Come on. You got him? Yeah, I got him. Alright, help me get him down. I'll get his legs. Ben. Can you hear me? Ben! Here. Try to get him to squeeze your hand. He can squeeze your hand to respond to you in case he can't talk. Okay. Ben. If you can hear me, squeeze my hand. He can hear me. That's good. Rob, give me your shirt. Thank you. Easy. It's alright, man. It's okay. You're alright. You're alright. Oh, God. Shit. His whole body's going into shock. Here come on, help me get the shirt. It's OK. It's OK. You're alright. You're alright. Come on, Ben. Put your arms under there. There you go. There you go. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Is he--? His pulse is weak, but I can still feel it. We need to get out of here. Yeah, world's most obvious statement. Any suggestions, how? We have no car and no phones. And staying here achieves what? Alright, we need to get Ben to a hospital. Yeah but we have no idea what's even out there. Or what even did this to him. He could've tripped or fallen-- And what about my car? Alright. Maybe we're just panicking. Thinking that two things are connected that really have nothing to do with each other. Let's just say somebody stole Jess' bag, and fucked up your car, and at the same time Ben trips, or falls-- Okay, math man. What's the probability of Ben and my car being completely coincidental? Huh? I'm just saying that-- You go out there then. Well, we can't just stay here! We have to do something. Ben? Ben. Ben. We have to get Ben to a hospital. Otherwise, he could-- I know. What can we do? We can't carry him all the way back to the highway. I know. But look, nobody's expecting us home anytime soon. They're not gonna miss us in class until Monday. Maybe not even then. Nobody's gonna save us. We're gonna have to save ourselves. How? Somebody has to go for help. What are you guys talking about? Rob's right. Ben needs a doctor. And the only way that's gonna happen is if somebody goes for help. So, who goes? Well I'm not leavin' Jess here alone. And she's not goin' by herself. So you want me to go? Fine. Jess and I will go together. You just stay here and take care of Ben. Look, I'll stay with Kyle. No, I said I'm not leaving you here. You're not leaving me here alone. But you have to go and get help so we can get out of here and we can save Ben. No. [Don't know what happened to Ben. But I don't think it was an accident. Alright? We don't know what's out there. You're right. We don't know who's out there. But what we do know is that Ben needs help. And you are gonna be much faster without me. I can look after Ben, and Kyle can look after me. It's the only way! You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Alright. I'm sorry. For what? It was my idea to come here. It's not your fault. But I was the one who convinced everyone to come. Yeah, but you didn't know this was gonna happen. I'm just trying to take responsibility. I mean, isn't that what I'm supposed to do? It sounds to me like you're just feeling sorry for yourself. Do you think that this is--? You know, real? I'd like to think so. But it hardly seems like the most important thing right now. It says they found gold. Just like they hoped. What? There's something-- They were being attacked. Well, according to this-- in four months the population of the town went from almost 150 people down to 30. They came for us at night. They were being attacked by wolves. Wolves? I told you I saw one. You said you thought you saw one. Shit. Jesus! Help me. Help me. It was wolves! They killed the settlers, We just read it in the diary! No shit. Oh, fuck. Shit. What are we gonna do? Fuck. What are we gonna do? Shit! Oh my God, your arm! Baby, what happened? Kyle! Kyle, get the table! You said that there weren't going to be any wolves. You said! Yeah well, there's fucking wolves here now! I can see that! Kyle, get that fucking table behind the window! Fuck! Shit. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Shit! What are we gonna do? This isn't gonna keep ‘em out! I don't know! Fuck! Help me! Why are they attacking us? I thought wolves were supposed to be afraid of people. I have no idea. Where'd they go? Kyle! Are you okay? I told you I saw a wolf. Why didn't you believe me? Yeah, there are wolves, alright? That doesn't change anything. We still need to help Ben, your friend. Didn't you see them out there? They'll rip us to pieces. I saw ‘em, Kyle. It makes me feel better about everything! Better? How do you figure that? We know what we're dealin' with now! They're trying to get inside! Fuck! Guys, the sun's about to set. We need to get out of here quick. Once it gets dark, we're fucked. In what, Rob? What, you think we're gonna be better out there? Kyle-- Alright, they'll fucking kill us/ We're not going out there-- Listen to me! Stop thinkin' about them as wolves! They're just dogs! That's all they are, just big dogs! Yeah, dogs that were fucking smart enough to have fucked up my car, and nearly killed Ben! Why are you such a fucking pussy? You're too fucking chicken shit to do anything. You need to man up! You guys, stop it! Okay? Staying here is not an option! Not for Ben. Kyle, Rob is right. We've got to think of them like dogs. It'll be okay. No it won't! This was just a dog! A dog that almost killed me when I was 12 and it says in the book that it was just dogs that killed everyone that lived here. We're gonna die if we go out there. Oh! Do you hear that? Shit. Get off him! Get off! See? Just like I said. They're just dogs. Just fucking dogs. God. Oh God. This isn't your fault. Don't blame yourself. It's not your fault-- We gotta get outta here, guys. They can see in the dark. We can't. So you mean go out there? Kyle, we've been over this, man. No matter what we do, they can get in here. Might not be five minutes. Maybe it will take an hour or two, but-- they're gonna get in here. So we can either wait around for ‘em or make a run for it. Then what about Ben? If we carry him we're gonna be too slow and they're gonna pick us off. We'll be too slow. Kyle. Ben's gone. He has no pulse. I'm sorry. Alright, that settles it. We're going. We're not going. Fine, fuck you. You stay. We'll send someone back for you. Rob, don't be such a dick. I'm not being a dick. I'm being practical. I know he's scared. Look, we're all fucking scared, Kyle. But staying here's the worst thing we could do. What about Ben? We can't leave him here. Kyle, we're not the fucking rangers. Never leave a fallen comrade is for people with guns that are highly trained. I mean, you were worried about Ben slowing us down before. How do you think it's gonna be now that it's--dead weight? Sorry, man. Look, I know this isn't the option you want. But it's the only one we have. I've proven we can kill these things. Let's get out. Let's try and get some help. Go to the highway. Find someone. Whatever it takes to get outta here. It's either that or you stay here-- and you're gonna end up the same as Ben. Kyle. I don't wanna stay here. I know you don't wanna leave him but-- We have to go. Fuck. Okay. I have, um-- I have a flashlight in my car, in the trunk. Good. We'll get it on the way. I think we can get out through these floorboards. They're kinda rotten. Let's give him a minute. We keep close together. Go building to building. Head to the car. Get the flashlight. Get the fuck outta Dodge. This isn't gonna work. They're coming. Alright, let's try this barn. Grab the door. Grab the door! Here. They're looking for a way to get in. Alright, go up there. We're just swapping being trapped in the saloon to being trapped in here. No, it's okay. Alright we're safe. At least for now. We're close to the car. We can get the flashlight. We could be a million miles away from the car. It doesn't matter. How are we gonna get past them? I can see your car from here. Still have your keys? Kyle, your keys. Do you have them? Yeah, they're right here. How fast do you think you can get there and back? I don't-- Not fast enough. It's like you said. We're just trapped in another place. We gotta do something. I'll go. Gimme the keys. I'll go! No. Fuck. No. I'll go. What's your plan? I'm gonna run a diversion. Okay? You get to the car. Get the flashlight and anything else you can grab and you get your ass back here. Got it? Yeah. Wait wait wait. What am I supposed to, sit and wait? No. You're gonna man the doors. You'll be safe in here until I get back. You promise? Yes! Yes, I fuckin' promise. Let's go. Kyle. Kyle. As soon as you see them take off after me, you run like hell. Got it? Got it? Yeah. Let's do this. Hey. Come here! Yeah, follow me. Follow me! Kyle. Kyle. God damn it, Kyle. Look at me! I need you. On the count of three you've gotta run. You ready? One, two, three! Go! Shit. What are you doing? I want you to walk towards me slowly. Please just go back to the barn. No. I'm not going without you. Walk towards me slowly. Just give me your hand. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. We need to arm ourselves. With what? There's dynamite. There's dynamite! What? Do you have anything to light it with? My bag! Die! Kyle, I'm gonna need you on this one. OK, we can get to the house. Come on! No! Oh shit! My fucking leg! Jess! Jess. Spit on that! What? It's your scent. They're tracking us all by scent. We'll use it as a distraction. Here you go. Take the bag. Rob, wipe your blood on that. Jess, can you run? Yes, if I have to. Kyle. Kyle, I need you to open your door a crack. Let them think they can get in. What? Let them think they can get in. The only way this is gonna work. Bring all the wolves together. Alright? Alright, are you ready? Alright, open it. You ready? Oh--00h God. We're in their lair. We're in here, but I think they're staying out there. But for how long? I dunno. Long enough for us to find a way outta here. The bones are all human. Hey. Here, sit down. How bad is it? It looks okay. You make for a crappy liar. Sorry. Sorry. That's okay. Hang on. I'm sorry. Think you can stand on it? Maybe. I don't think I'll be outrunning any wolves. You'll be alright, I promise. Thank you. Whose bag? It's mine. See if there's anything useful. Probably not, right? Well, guys, I think I left all my survival gear in my other bag. Sorry. We still have this. What, you wanna read 'em bedtime stories? It might say something about how they fought the wolves. Maybe there's information in here we can use. Yeah, knock yourself out. Hey. Let him read. "We built Paradise in the heart of the wilderness. "We did what we always did "and took what we always wanted. "But Paradise came with a price, "because we didn't understand that Paradise wasn't ours to take. "So we hunted the wolves, determined to keep the town safe." "But that only made things worse. "Maybe they'd have been content if we'd've just moved on "and left them in peace. "Now we know they won't stop until we're all dead." That the answer you were lookin' for? Everyone dies? Well, maybe they didn't all die. Alright, I'm just tryin' to help. Yeah, you're the fuckin' reason we're all here. And you don't think I know that? Huh, you don't think I know that Ben's dead because of me? Okay, you guys, stop! We have to work together. And it's gonna take both of you to help me get out of here. Everything here belongs to the wolves. They were here way before anybody. And it's like you said, Rob. You know, we show up and we take what we want, and kill anyone or anything that gets in our way. Which helps us how? They want us gone! Alright, they just wanna be left alone. Alright, what's your plan? Huh? You wanna go out here, talk to the fuckin' wolves, and let them know that we promise that we'll never come back? You think they're just gonna let us walk away? No, we've gone way past that. We've already done exactly the same as the people in your book. Alright, they're not gonna leave us alone. They could've just scared us away when we got here but they didn't. They trashed your car. They killed Ben. You think now, that the fuckin' shit's hit the fan, they're just gonna change their behavior and let us walk away? No. You look after Jess. They try and come in here, you keep them the fuck away from her. Where are you going? I'm gonna go get us some dynamite. Thanks, by the way. You know for-- for coming to help me out there by the car. Of course. That's what we do. Besides, you fixed up my leg. You saved my ass outside. I'd say that makes us just about even, right? Right. So how come you never asked me out? What? How come you never asked me out? You were with Rob. I mean before that. You know, we've been in class for the better part of a year. I just wondered if you-- I don't know. I guess it just never seemed like the right time to. So you at least thought about it? Yeah. I mean, that's all I ever do-- is think about stuff. So how did you and Rob-- you know, end up together? Well for starters, he asked me. OK, right. But-- mean you liked him, right? Yeah. I mean, he's a really nice guy. And, we've only been dating for about a month or so, so it's not like we have any major commitments. We're just seeing how things go. You know? What? I don't know, it's just when you say it like that, you make it sound so easy. Like everyone can do it. You know? Everyone can do it. Well, not everyone. I wish I could. You know, it's like dogs. You know I wish I wasn't afraid of them. I mean believe me, I know how stupid it is. I just- Kyle. It's not stupid. I mean, come on, you were attacked by a dog. You nearly died. It's completely understandable. It's not like you were attacked by a girl, were you? No. I mean you're lucky. You don't even have to worry about asking people out. You're a girl. Okay, you're right. Because I can't even remember the last time that I had to ask anybody out. See? Fourth grade. Cooper Brand. What happened? He said no. Do you know that at 10-years-old I was less appealing than the latest video game? Well, of course. I'm joking. You know what though? You're right. I'm lucky. Kyle! Kyle Kyle Kyle... Sorry. That's okay. I think they're coming in. Oh God. You scared the crap out of me. I'm sorry. I got it. Let's get outta here. What about the wolves? Nah, I think for the most part they're all out front. I think some of them actually might be asleep. They didn't even hear me or notice me when I went outside. What's the plan? I'll explain it on the way up. We made it through the night. Let's just make it home. Would you explain to us how? You see that shack over there by the lake? That looks safe. Yeah and past that's the highway. Right. I'll get you guys there. I'm gonna come back. Lure ‘em in, and blow ‘em up. Okay. Just take it slow. We made it. Yeah, this far. Now what? I got it. No. No. Look, we don't have to Kill them. It's too dangerous. Let's just go. It's still three or four miles to the highway. You really wanna risk it with her leg? Kyle, don't worry. These stupid dogs don't even realize we left. I'll be back, okay? I'll be back. See? Rob, behind you! No! No, let me go! Kyle, let me go! No, let me go! Kyle, let me go! No, let me go! Kyle, let me go! Kyle, get off mel! Let me go! Let me go! No! Nooo! Let me go! Let me go! Jess, no! Let me go. Let go of me! Kyle, let me go! Let me go. Let go of me! Kyle, let go. Let me go! You can't go out there! No! Let me go! No! Stop! Stop! No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. What are they doing? Kyle? Just stay where you are. Jess, no. Oh, my God. What have they done? They're showing us how they want this to end. What's gonna happen to us. And we have got to get outta here. How? Rob's plan. Rob's plan? Look at ‘em, Kyle. They're just laying there dead. It's because they're out there, I think I know how I can make this work. You think or you know? Look, we are not ending up like that. We're goin' home. / Don't wanna die out here. I'm not gonna let that happen to you. Kyle, you don't have to do this. Yes, I do. Besides, they're just dogs, right? Good luck. Kyle. Thank God. Come on. Where's the lighter? I don't have it. Why isn't he attacking us? He's smart. Yeah, you know what that is, don't you? That's why you didn't follow me into the lair. I thought he wanted us all dead. Not if it means he dies, too. He just wants his town back.
