JENNIFER: Catch us if you can. MAN: Jennifer Lorraine Gibbons, you are charged with the following counts. You did jointly, with another, enter a certain building, as a trespasser, steal 25 pencils, one pair of headphones, an electric clock, a pair of scissors, and a carton of Play-Doh, of a value together of 40 pounds and 50 pence. Between the 15th and 18th of October 1981, at Haverford west in the county of Dyfed, did enter a certain building, as a trespasser, steal therein drink and food items to the value of five pounds and 24 pence. And on the 20th day of October 1981, without lawful excuse, damaged by fire a tractor store. Jennifer Lorraine Gibbons, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? (quietly): G-g-g-g... COURT CLERK: And you, June Alison Gibbons, have been charged on the same counts. How do you plead, guilty or not guilty? Uh, Dr. Hamilton, uh, thank you for attending court today. Could you please tell the court your opinion on how you found each of the defendants' state of mind when you examined them? And could you give the court your recommendations that you have? My professional opinion is that each defendant suffers from a mental illness. A psychopathic disorder, a subnormality of such a degree to warrant their detention in a hospital for medical treatment. As such, admission has been arranged for Broadmoor Hospital. (shocked murmuring) JUDGE: Does Broadmoor have facilities that people of their age require? It is not, not usual for persons so young to come to Broadmoor. Uh, however, I think compared to the remand centre, Broadmoor offers a certain freedom and also therapy. Uh, their treatment there will consist of teaching them to speak. And we maintain a sort of village-like atmosphere at the hospital. There are gardens. Uh, we have, uh, hairdressers, uh, beautiful bathrooms, and such. Sports facilities for maintaining patients' fitness. Oh, and, uh, we even have a swimming pool.
