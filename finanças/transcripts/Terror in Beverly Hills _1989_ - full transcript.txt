(speaks foreign language) (dark electronic music) - I'm sorry, gentlemen, but you must buckle your seat belts. - I have mine. - [Mohammed] Don't touch me, infidel. - Thank you. - Abdul. - Yes, Mohammed. - Do you think we are doing the right thing? - I don't understand, a man like you who was about graduate from the University of Madrid asking such a question. If you don't have faith to what we are doing, why you come with me? - Because of the hatred they have for our kind. The Spaniards deported me. Deport me where? Because of the wars, I have no home there no more. - I was once like you, Mohammed, I lost everything. You know, there are still many like us. Hey, don't worry. It takes time, but we'll get our rights one day. - That's true. (speaks foreign language) (boy laughs) I'll be right back. - You shouldn't do that. How old are you? - Six. (somber atmospheric music) (suspenseful electronic music) - [Woman] Filthy Arab. - [PA System] Attention! All passengers arriving from the far east and Europe. - Hi. Passport. Thank you. - Hello. - What is the purpose of your trip, gentlemen? - We are just visiting friends. - For how long? - A month. - Have a nice visit. - Thank you. - [PA System] US Air flight 21 now departing for San Jose and San Francisco. Mr. George Benedict, Mr. George Benedict. Please report to the Information Desk. (announcement in foreign language) - [Security Man] Sir, excuse me, sir. You dropped your wallet. - Thank you. - Attention. Attention, ladies and gentlemen. Flight 21 now departing for New York, Paris and Rome. All arrivals and departures are limited to three-minute parking. All arrivals and departures are limited to three-minute parking. - [Mohammed] Have you been here in Los Angeles before, Abdul? - [Abdul] Mm-hm, yeah. - [Mohammed] An old friend of yours lives here. - [Abdul] Yeah, I know. Hack Stone. I'll deal with him later. - [Mohammed] We have two meeting places. One here and the other at an ocean beach house. - [Abdul] Good. (dark electronic music) (chatter in foreign language) - [Anchor] Coming up on the evening news, extend yet another olive branch to Israel with an invitation to an international conference. - We've got work to do. - It's an honor to meet you, Abdul. - Thank you. - Yes. You've done much for our cause. Now, the woman Azizeh who is part of our team, has secured a location outside of the city where you will hold the target hostage. - I see. - Has food, water and communication been set up? - [Man] I'll take care of that, sir. - After the strike, we'll have change of clothes for you in the van. - Great. What about arms and ammunition? - There are guns in the van and also more at the location. - Good, what else? - I have made a videotape of the villa where the target is staying. - Good, let's see. (suspenseful music) - The target always travels with three bodyguards. The villa is surrounded by security people. I have planned this operation according to my orders. - I know the orders, Abbas. See, I planned it. Okay, I'm here to take complete charge of the operation. So, I know when we go and how. As you see, the target is heavily guarded. We must wait until she leaves the villa tomorrow. Then we strike. Everything is clear? So, you are all excused. (ominous electronic music) Hack. (man grunts) - [Man] Just when I think I might have you for the first time, you deck me, Hack. Wow. (laughs) - You're doing good, Billy, you keep it up. You'll be able to whip my butt. (chuckles) Let's have some coffee, come on. (Bully grunts) (moody electronic music) Is black alright, Bill? - Yeah, fine. Who are these guys? - Oh, those characters, part of a middle-east covert group I was involved with for about two years, matter of fact. - Who's the dude with the binoose? - Oh, this guy? - Yeah. - That was my pal Abdul. We did a lot of secret missions together. And other fun things, if you know what I mean. - He looks pretty tough. - Yeah, I'm sure he'd agree with you on that. - Really? - Yeah, Abdul was a pretty mean character, pretty tough. Was my best friend, he once saved my life. But this character over here just wanted to prolong it for some crazy cause that I don't really understand or know about. - Where is he now? - [Hack] In the middle-east, dead, I hope. - Wait a minute. You said he was a friend of yours. - Yeah, he was my best friend. But as long as he's alive, my life is always on the edge. - I don't get it, why? - Well, there was a time we captured four of the enemy. He wanted to execute 'em on the spot and I decided that we should bring them in to camp. And, uh, of course he didn't like that too much. Unfortunately, two of them escaped that night, went back to his home where he lived, and killed his wife and kids. And obviously he blamed me for my "American sense of justice." And he swore that one day he'd come back and he'd kill me. - I hope he's dead, too, Hack. I wouldn't wanna meet up with a character like that. - And neither would I. Yeah, I'm through with that kind of fight. Now it's all hands and feet. I teach you guys how to defend yourselves against your wives. - Yeah, I gotta get a move on. We're getting a special briefing today. - Yeah, what's up? - A VIP is coming to town to do some shopping on Rodale Drive. - Ah, the working class, huh? - (chuckles) Right. Well, whoever it is, we sure are beefing up security. (phone rings) - Yes? Hey, you must be moving up in the world, pal. It's Captain Stills with the LAPD. - [Officer] I've got Derrick on line five, Captain Stills. - Hello, Bill. I want you to move your ass to Rodale Drive. This thing is jumpin'. The FBI's gettin' kinda nervous about our VIP visitor. You got that? You move your ass to Rodale Drive and you stay there. - Right, Captain. See ya, Hack. - Yeah, take care. (moody atmospheric music) (guns fire) (people scream) (moody electronic music) - Girls are lookin' pretty good today. - Ah, but not as good as the English. What do you think? - (chuckles) Where's England? (upbeat electronic music) - Hey, cousin! - Hi, Bruce, my man! I've got something hot for you today. - Hey, Gandhi, I heard your wife won the California lottery. - (laughs) And I haven't seen her since. - That's cool, she was ugly anyway, so what you got today? - I got this hot watch for you. - Oh, it's hot! And it's a couple minutes slow. - Bruce, be careful, the cops are all over the place today. - I know, I've never seen so many cops in Beverly Hills. What is this, some kind of summit meeting or somethin'? - Don't ask me, I'm just an Indian. (laughs) - 50? - 50! - Alright. Okay now. Be cool. (suspenseful music) - Get ready, they're coming. Houssein, don't lose it. - Ten four. - Here's 100, keep the change. - Thanks, lady. (suspenseful electronic music) - Okay, I've got you! - Hey, man! - Come on, come on! - What are you doin'? - Spread the legs! - Hey man, I live around here! - So do I. - This is my neighborhood, come on, man! - Let's go shopping, honey. - Okay. - [Shop Assistant] Can I help you gentlemen? (guns fire) (men groan) (woman screams) (guns fires) (gun fires rapidly) (glass smashes) (gun fires rapidly) (woman screams) (woman groans) (man speaks in foreign language) (explosion booms) (woman screams) (moody electronic music) (tires screech) - On your feet, punk, we're taking a little ride. - Come on, man. Hey, no way, man, I get car sick. - Get in the car! (siren wails) Crystal, they grabbed her, I'm in pursuit. Get me backups. - I got you, Derrick, backups on the way. - Shit, man, what're you doing? You're gonna get us killed! - Towards the tunnel. (tires screech) - Shit. I should have listened to my astrologist, and stay in bed today. Right! Hey, man! Come on, we're tailgating! - Shut up, asshole. Give me that god damn car. Come on, get out! (gun fires) (gun fires) (guns fire) (gun fires) Son of a bitch, I'm gonna get those bastards. (moody electronic music) (muffled radio chatter) (muffled radio chatter) - Excuse me, sir, the people that got out of that van, did you see where they went? - Yeah, they got into a large white limo. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Thanks, Pops. This is car 69, I have positive ID on kidnappers' van. Suspects left in white limo. (tires screech) (siren wails) (helicopter blades whir) - Okay, keep looking. - Hey, there they are. - Where? I don't see em'. - Over there! There! - I can't believe my eyes, Billy. They're lookin' right at me. - Wow! Look at those babies! (laughs) (moody electronic music) - [Woman] Where are you taking me? (screams) - Up here, this way. (woman pants and yelps) - Take her up! Come on! Hurry up! Ali, tie her up over there. - [Woman] No, please, you can't do this to me, no! Who are you people? God! No, please don't do this to me! (sobs) - [Ali] American bitch! (spits) - Abdul, why are you calling here? The radio is supposed to be only for emergencies! - They got Mohammed, Mohammed has been shot. - Is he still alive? - Yes. We need a doctor, soon. - We'll see what we can do for him. - Abdul. - What? - Do you still think we are doing the right thing? - Sure. Everything gonna be alright. When we finish this job, I have another personal score to settle in Los Angeles. Don't you worry, okay? - Good afternoon, this is Tony Motta with a special report. This afternoon, the president's daughter was kidnapped by a group of middle-east terrorists. Please stay tuned to this station for further updates. - Look, Miss. These are our demands. I want you to read them clearly into the tape recorder. No funny business, okay? - No, my father can't comply with those demands. It's not possible. (Abdul grunts) (woman yelps) (woman sobs) - Come on. - Okay, okay, okay. - [Abdul] Go ahead. - We will release the president's daughter after the president of the United States has ordered the Israelis to release 55 of our political brothers. If the president does not meet these demands, his daughter Margaret will die. You've got 12 hours. (sobs) (phone rings) - Tony Motta. - Hello, TV station? - Yes, it is. - Okay, this is a message from president's daughter. Are you ready? - Hold on. Get this on tape. Go ahead. - Okay. - [Margaret] We will release the president's daughter after the president of the United States has ordered the Israeli to release 55 of our-- (phone rings) - Get a trace on the location of the call, Lenny. - We'll put a trace on it. - Harder! - A super trace! - Give me that damn phone! Get a fuckin' super trace! Asshole. - Got it? Good. - Damnit! Damnit, Lenny! I know I'm gonna lose my pension. I knew something like this would happen. - Well, Captain, the president's daughter wasn't on the line long enough for us to get a good trace, or pinpoint the exact location. - Well, what about a general location? - Somewhere near the ocean. - We're now showing you a tape of the actual kidnapping of the president's daughter by her middle-east captors. (gun fires) (Margaret screams) - Damn security camera. Why we didn't kill it before? - I don't know, Abdul. - Yes, I'm watching the god damn news. What are you watching, a porno movie? Sons of bitches. - [Tony] White House Press Secretary George McCann said today and I quote, "The president has already called "a meeting of his security people to take the necessary "steps to rescue his daughter Margaret," end of quote. The president's daughter is being held hostage by a group of middle-east terrorists. Press Secretary McCann continued by saying, "The president will call in the military if necessary." The entire nation is left in suspense over the safety of the president's daughter Margaret. - God damnit. - [Tony] In the meantime, the Los Angeles Police Chief has put Captain Marion Stills of the LAPD in charge of the case. In this reporter's opinion, Captain Stills really has his work cut out for him. Here again are the terrorists' demands. - [Margaret] We will release the president's daughter after the president of the United States has ordered the Israelis to release 55 of our political brothers. If the president does not meet these demands, his daughter Margaret will die. You've got 12 hours. - That was the voice of the president's daughter delivering the terrorists' demands. (moody electronic music) - Yes, thank you, Harry, but believe me when I tell you I have bigger problems right now. Talk about it next Tuesday and I thank you. Uh-huh. How the hell did this happen, gentlemen? I'm always caught up in these damn middle-east conflicts. Now they've got my daughter. I wanna know what the hell we're doing about it. - [Man] Mr. President, we have an actual location where your daughter's being held. We have ground and air crew are looking for a white limousine, the car they all escaped in. - Would you tell me what an "actual location" means, son? This is my daughter. - [Man] Mr. President, we're doing all we can. We will get your daughter back. - I know you will. I know you will and I appreciate it. Now if you gentlemen will excuse me, I have to talk to the Prime Minister of Israel. And that will be all. (suspenseful electronic music) (helicopter blades whir) - Police helicopters! - This is chopper 14, I think I've spotted the white limo out here by the old bean factory. - Ten four, chopper. - Tony Motta. Yes, Crystal. - The terrorists have the president's daughter in the old bean factory off the 101. - Yes, fabulous! Fantastic! Thanks, hon, the check's in the mail! - Red alert, one niner eight. Red alert, one niner nine. Red alert, one niner one. (dramatic electronic music) (sirens wail) - The police are all around us, now what? - Shut up. They're probably here to negotiate. Doctor gonna be here soon. - Abdul. I'm afraid. - Don't be. I'm here. (Mohammed groans) - Cars 17, 18, 11 and 12, proceed to the bean factory off the 101. (dramatic electronic music) (tires screech) Cars 24, 27, 31, move in on the old bean factory off of 101. (sirens wail) (tired screech) Red alert, red alert, go paramedics, go SWAT team! - The police, they are in the building across the square! - Don't worry, Azizeh. They won't shoot as long as we have president's daughter. - Police are everywhere! - Get back to the hostage! - [Stills] Alright, what the hell do we have here? - They're up there on the third floor, near the window. - Abdul, some police have come out. They're looking at us. - Something wrong. I don't like it, Mohammed. - [Stills] Have all the backups arrived yet? - Yes, sir. - Alright, close the fuckin' doors. I don't wanna be shot in my back. Now gather around here, men, let's see if we can figure out what to do about these assholes. Now, I want you to show me the exact location of that god damn room. - It's right there, sir. - Exact? - Yes, sir. - Did you check that out? - Yes. - Now for the good news. The honorable president has declared we cannot fire a single god damn shot. - That's making it awfully hard for us, sir. - Tell me about it. Will you close the fuckin' doors? Tight! Assholes. (sighs) Thank god I got a pension comin' up. Close that fuckin' door! Get your fuckin' head shot off. Close it! - I understand, Mr. Prime Minister, but you must also understand I do not have 24 hours. It's a question of my daughter's life. I have just a few hours to deal with these people. Yes, sir, I know you have a daughter and uh, and I would sincerely hope that when you come to a decision, you will get back to me just as soon as you possibly can. Thank you. Shalom. Howard. Get a hold of the FBI. You have them tell those terrorists we're waiting for a final word from Israel. I'm not gonna wait much longer. Now you do that. Yes, hello. It's the president. Would you please get me Marine Corps General Kyle Gray in Virginia? If he's not in his home, you try his country club. It's quite important you do that for me, will you? It's the president, thank you. (sighs) God help us. - Operator, give me the police department. Tell them we've got the president's daughter. And look, back off or I kill the girl. - Where's that undercover man, that god damn Derrick? - [Derrick] Right here, sir! - [Stills] What the hell is that outfit you're wearin'? - You said it was alright, sir. - Well, you know I got no taste! Jesus, it's like you got it on Bouchies on 7th. (phone rings) - Billings here. - Who is it? - The terrorist. Here, Derrick. - Yeah, Derrick here. - We've got the terrorist call on line five. - Patch him through. - I have a man badly wounded, I need a doctor now! And listen, if you don't send doctor right away, I'll cut the girl in two pieces, you got it? - No way, you'll just make the doctor another hostage. - [Abdul] If you don't get me a doctor, I'll kill the girl and throw her out the window, you hear me? - Alright, alright, we'll send in a paramedic. Alright, get me a paramedics outfit, I'm goin' in there. - Bill, why you? - Because somebody's gotta do it, and I've had some medical training. - [Officer] Here you are, sir. - I wanna put a bug on ya, and I wanna spy on your every single movement. We'll get somebody in there to help you. Now move it. - Got ya. - Move it! - Yes, Kyle, yes. Thank you. I assume you know what's been happening. I'm gonna need some military help here. - Yes, I saw it on the news, I'm sorry. But Mr. President, I have the man for you. Two years on covert operations in the middle-east, fighting on our side, of course. (chuckles) - What's his name and how do I get hold of him? - His name is Hack Stone. You should remember, Mr. President. After all, you pinned the medal of honor on him. - Yes, I do remember that Hack Stone. Well, he'll be our man. Activate him immediately and put him on this thing. Thank you, Kyle. Hack Stone. (chuckles) - How about that, Dad? - Boy, that's terrific, son, I gotta tell ya. I'm proud of ya. Well, miss, I guess you can tell where this boy gets his talent. - Teacher said he might even skip a grade. - How about that, Dad? - How about that. That's great, why don't you go and put your gi on and show your mommy how good you look, huh? - Okay, Dad. - I can tell now where he gets his brains and his looks. - And don't you ever forget it. - Oh, me? I wouldn't forget that. - Sweetheart, wouldn't you love to just go wash up? - That bad, huh? Well, we'll forget this. (phone rings) - Hack Stone Studio. Just a minute. It's Washington. It's for you. - Hello. - Hack, General Gray here. - Yes, General, how are you doing? - Fine, Hack, just fine. I suppose you know what's going on? - Yes, sir. - Hack, did you know there are some bad guys in the middle-east that have got a price on your head? - Yeah, and the bad guys just showed up in Beverly Hills. - [Kyle] Right. Hack, I think this job is for you. - Like this bullet's for you, huh? Why me? - Because you were a friend of this Abdul guy, and I think you're the only one that can handle the son of a bitch. - I'm retired, I'm a private citizen now, I just, uh... - Not anymore. But Hack, it's your decision. - Well, I'm not too good at making decisions, sir. The last one I made got me in trouble. (sighs) But I guess... I'm your man. - Great, great. Report to Captain Stills, LAPD. He has all the details. And Hack, don't fail me. - I'll try not to, sir. - [Kyle] Good luck, Hack. - Thank you, sir. (dark electronic music) - Come, do you have to go? - It's rock and roll, honey. - Why? - Don't you worry about anything. Hack don't kill that easy. - Step on it, Jimmy boy. - Come on, girls, let's get set. I'm going in to talk to Captain Stills, and for God's sakes, don't get shot. - Azizeh, Azizeh, look! The television people are taking the picture of us. - Good, that means the president of the United States will know we mean business. (moody musical jingle) - Get a shot of that third-story window. That's where the action is. And let's get some shots of these cops. I think there's gonna be a shootout. - [Woman] What about Captain Stills? - He's gonna give us an interview. - [Woman] Here he comes now. - Alright! Alright, I have a statement for you. Motta, how come you're always the first to arrive? You got somebody tipping you off? - I have a crystal ball, sir. - Well, I certainly hope so. You get the glimpse of your pension and now you need the damn glasses to read it, huh? (chuckles) Well, here's the statement. Oh, don't run that camera when I'm smoking. As you're all aware, the president's daughter is being held hostage by a terrorist group inside that building. They have presented their demands which are that the Israelis must free 55 of their politicals. Or they have threatened to assassinate the president's daughter. The President of the United States is negotiating as I speak, with the Prime Minister of Israel. Damned airplanes. Also, unfortunately, we've had several setbacks in our attempt to rescue her. - But Captain Stills-- - But off. Motta. Why don't you open an Italian restaurant, huh? Jesus. - Did you get that? - I sure did. - What a bastard. (moody electronic music) - Hey, hey, stop there! - Take it easy. - Put the box down! - Just relax, okay? - Put the box down, open it! Shut the box! Come on! - Okay. - Right, turn around and shut up! Come back now, move! I said move! (helicopter blades whir) (moody electronic music) - Well, the bastards are still there. - Here, Chief, this is connected to the bug. - [Azizeh] Yes, yes, keep moving, keep moving! Alright! Come on! - [Derrick] Dying, huh? - [Abdul] Look, if you want to come out of this alive, fix him up and keep your mouth shut. - He's lucky, the bullet went clean through his shoulder. He'll be alright for now, but he'd be better off in a hospital. - Shut up. - Okay. I'd like to see the president's daughter. - Why? - I'd like to assure the police she's okay. (thud) (groans) (moody electronic music) (groans) (groans) - What the hell is this? A mic. Listen to me. I told you, we are not playing games here. This is your last mistake, next time the girl dies! - God help us. - [Abdul] Do you think you are the only people ready to die for a cause? You are trying to trick us, now your man dies! You asshole! You're prepared to die in here. So don't provoke us if you want her alive, is that clear? Execute him. - Take him out and finish him! (groans) (suspenseful music) (shouting over each other) (thuds) (grunts and groans) - Come on, down on your knees! (shouting over each other) (gun fires rapidly) (Derrick groans) Come on! Give me that, come on! (gun fires) (suspenseful music) (shutters clang) (gun fires) - If you try any more rescue attempt, I throw out of window president daughter! Tell the president he has only a few more hour! Alright? - Billings. It's for you, Captain. - Yeah. Oh. General Gray. Nice of you to call, General. Well, that's the situation. Well, we need all the help we can get. I think it's best to keep it quiet now. Right. I understand. Thank you for calling, General. Sir. I'll be a son of a bitch. - What's up, Captain? - They've called in the fuckin' marines. - The marines? - Not all of them, dummy, just one. One fuckin' marine. Christ. (ominous electronic music) - He's coming. - Please be patient, as soon as anything develops, we'll let you know. - Captain Stills. - Yeah. - What is Hack Stone's first move? - Why don't you look in your crystal ball? - And if that fails? - Then we'll need your crystal ball. Both of 'em. God damn. - (chuckles) He's still a bastard. Get a shot up there. (helicopter blades whir) (moody electronic music) - Another helicopter is landing. - [Tony] It's Stone alright. Get a closeup of him as he runs by. - Azizeh, hand me the phone. Abbas. The president of the United State brought in an old enemy. - Yes, I know. He is the enemy. - I want him dead, and I want to do it. - You do your own mission and I'll stop Hack Stone. - Right. - [Stills] Where is that god damn girene? - Aye aye, skipper. - Skipper? Yeah. Those fuckers in there are fanatics. Ready to die for a cause. - That's right, Captain, just like you and me. - [Stills] Huh? - Ready to die for what they believe in. - [Stills] Huh? - I told the president yesterday, I felt if we gave in to those terrorists that those boys will try to run the whole show. - Yeah and do away with our way of justice, and my friggin' pension. - Gee, that's too bad. - And did the president agree with you? - He always does. - Always does, huh? I know that some shithead bastard tyrant is behind all this. - [Hack] Yeah, does a bear shit in the woods? - I hate tyrants, will somebody please show this fuckin' marine where the terrorists are? (suspenseful music) - [Mother] What are you doing with him? - Shut up, kid, come on! - Mommy, Mommy! Mommy, Mommy! Where are we going? - Shut up, go. - Mommy! (radio bleeps) - Yes, Abbas. - Don't worry about Hack Stone. We have his wife and his son here at the beach house. - Good. Now we force his hand. (ominous electronic music) (phone rings) - Billings. It's for you, Stone. - Yeah, Stone here. - Remember my promise, Hack? You will never come out of this alive. I swear it by my honor. - Abdul, why don't you just chill out? You ain't got a chance in hell and you know it. - No, you won't stop me. Not if you want to see your wife and son back again. - Captain, I've gotta get outta here. - What's up? - The terrorists have just grabbed my wife and kid. If I stay on this job, they're gonna kill them sure as hell, just like they did Bill Derrick. - Look, Stone, we'll get the bastard who did it, and we'll get your family back. - Oh, to hell you will. You don't know this Abdul character like I do. He kills and he likes it. - Just hold on, Stone. - Hold on, shit. This ain't my fight and it ain't my decision. I didn't ask to be reactivated. You remember one thing and you remember it well. I'm a private citizen. - You hold on, Stone. Now, the private citizen is the law. Law makers might make the law, and assholes like me might enforce it, but it's the duty of the private citizen to uphold the law! There is no law if the private citizen doesn't uphold it! You got that? Shit. - Bull-shit. - Captain, helicopter 16 spotted a woman and a kid being hustled into a beach house by some suspicious-looking characters. (suspenseful music) - Get a chopper here on the double. You hold on there, Stone. You're under executive orders, you cannot leave here. But we can, my men and I. And we will find your family and rescue them, so help me god. - Look, Captain, I know Abdul. His bunch, they fight real dirty, and the only way you're gonna whip their ass is fightin' dirtier than them. - I just hope that one morning we don't wake up and realize we are dirtier. - You just bring back my family. - You can count on it, marine. - I hope so. - That was a little hairy in there for a minute. - Yeah, it was hairy, well, Stone was just wrestling with the consequences of his decision. - Well, he seems like a man of principle. - Yes, of course, he loves his family, he loves his country. - You just had to remind him of his duties, which is an extension of his principles. - That's very well put, Lenny. Now let's haul ass and find his family. - Some guy, your Captain Stills. - You better believe it. Captain Stills just stuck his neck out for you. - Mm, how's that? - Look, if the chief finds out the captain deserted his post to rescue your family, chief will throw him off the force. Your goodbye. - I was right, he is a nice guy. Now you don't work too hard. - Abdul! - [Abdul] What? - The helicopter took off with the American in it. - That's a decoy. I know Hack. Now he'll make his move. (moody electronic music) - What are you doing to me? What are you doing? No, stop it. No, stop it. - Quiet. - Don't do this to me, please don't do this. Please stop it. (suspenseful music) What are you doing to me? No, no, please don't do this to me. Please leave me alone, please leave me alone. (screams) Untie me, please untie me, please. I'll do anything you want. - Be quiet. - Please untie me, please, please. Just untie me, please. (screams wildly) (suspenseful music) (screams) (gun fires) - Houssein, tie her up again. (shouts in foreign language) (shouts in foreign language) (exotic eastern music) - Hey, why don't you make some tea? - American tea? - Right. - [Terrorist] You know, Abbas, I just hope Abdul's personal revenge with Hack Stone doesn't get us all killed. (muffled gun fires) (dog barks) - Why is that dog barking? - I'll go take a look. (dog barks) (groans and chokes) (ominous electronic music) - [Officer] Freeze, freeze, freeze! - Freeze! (gun fires) (gun fires) That guy made my day. Mrs. Stone. I'm officer Leonard, LAPD. - Oh, thank god, untie me please. - Just a minute here. - Oh, my baby. - Give me the boy. Come, give me the boy. - Okay. - There you go. - Oh, Jamie. It's gonna be okay. - Mommy. - It's alright, it's okay now. Come on, guys, let's go. - We're gonna go home now.

Help me, please help me! - [Abdul] Back off or she dies! - Don't be crazy, man, I'm your friend. I can walk you outta here and no one will hurt you. I promise you. - (chuckles) Walk out of here with the executioner of my wife and children? (chuckles) Are you crazy or what? Hack, if my cause is lost, I'm a dead man. Dead men don't walk!

No cause is worth dyin' for. - What do you know about a cause? - Don't be crazy, man, don't be crazy. - Hack, I'll show you, how to die for your cause. - No! (glass smashes) (guns fire rapidly) No, don't shoot! (guns fire rapidly) (somber atmospheric music) Christ. Why? - [Abdul] You're asking me why? - [Hack] It's all madness. - [Tony] Oh, come on, guys, all we want is an interview. Keep the camera on her. - All clear, all clear.
