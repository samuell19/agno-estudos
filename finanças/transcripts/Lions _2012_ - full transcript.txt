Sofi! Isa! - Where are you?! - Here! Said 'I love you', she said 'I know'. No, wait. That's eight words. Let's go, come on. Liar. - Me? - Yeah, you. - Why? - Where were you? Behind you guys. Searching for Isa. You're such a liar. I like it that you're a liar, anyway. Do you remember Isa in the country house? - No. Well, kind of. - What's up with you? Depending on who walks up to me, I'll be an angel or a demon. Right, but I'm an angel. You are an angel, dear. That's true. I would always go to a house with a tiger. I'm not sure, the guy was a millionaire. I told you about it, remember? Rema's house, Nene. We used to call his house 'the bestiary'. - Arturo! - Hey, guys. Did you bring any books? Or something to read? I don't know, I. Did you notice books have the same enemies we do? Fire, humidity. Animals, time, and their own content. Books don't have enemies. You do. What time is it? - Twelve o'clock. - Twelve in the night. Both our watches are wrong. We must have gotten that from mom and dad. Mom would never reset her watch. - I can't walk anymore! - Guys, she's tired of walking. Hey, what if we keep playing that game? Sure, Hemingway's six-word phrases. - Which game? - Each one of us has to come up with one within a minute, or otherwise they have to do a dare. Which one is it? We played it at Niki's birthday, remember? - I never played. - I remember the one Hemingway said: 'For sale: baby shoes, never worn.' That's nice. Well, it's sad. but it's a good one. I came to say I'm leaving. That's six words! - I came... to... - Right. They need to be six. Arturo, you come up with one now! Choked on strawberries, died of irony. Six! I can't think of anything. Said 'I love you', she said 'I know'. That's eight words! That is eight, yeah. Isa doesn't want to play, guys. Cook for myself, add some cyanide. - Tonight, as much as you want. - Get out of here! I say you girls take your clothes off, and switch outfits. No, wait! Saw the empty gun in your pants. That's seven words! That's seven, Isa. The man who killed zombies... dies. That's a great one. Hey, it's going to rain. Come on, Sofia. Say your usual one. With a bloody... neck... ...she said goodbye. Six words. That's seven words! See? I told you. You can eat them. Just be careful anyway, Isa. We need to check the color, the texture... check them for bugs. Sofi, you need to eat something. Hey, let me have one. Catch it, pussy. Mmm, it's disgusting! Can I borrow that recorder of yours, boy? I'll record, I'll do it! What do you want? What are you doing? I'm sorry, okay? I'm nervous. Man, every time. You're an asshole! I say we go back the way we came. Quit it. I don't want to think about it. Come on, wake up. We all have to figure out what to do. Aren't you guys sleepy? I'll sleep when I'm dead. - Where is my anime pillow? - Six words! That's five words! It's not gonna rain, Isa. Yes, it will. You'll see. Niki... If a car crashes on the highway, where do they take it afterwards? Not a clue, Isa. Here. What is this? A letter I wrote a year before I met you. It says: 'A year before you.' - But wait, don't open it yet. - Now I want to know. Let's go find the house. Isa will get upset if we don't. Alright, let's go. Rained... rained... rained... - ...and never stopped. - Can you quit that game? Don't cheat, pussy. - This place gives me the creeps. - I see dead people. Shut up, you asshole. I'm scared. Were you never outside Buenos Aires? Leaving the cities makes you more dumb. I'm sorry, Isa. We got lost following Arturo's lead. I'm so stupid. You are what you are, and deal with it, Sofia. What do you mean, Sofi? Which fault? Don't worry, it's her fault. Niki really misses his brother. Of course he does. You would also miss me if I died like that. Arturo! Nothing like that will ever happen to you, sis. Intellectual end, funeral march of thought. Six! One is missing. Do you think it's loaded? Empty the gun, Niki. Is it loaded, Arturo? Is it? No, it's not. Wait a bit. What do you do with the recorder all day long? - I'm recording you, stupid. - Let's see, play something. Hear this out. No, no, this is not it. So nerdy, classical music. It's inside your car, snob bastard. I'm really hungry now, guys. I'm fine, Isabelita. I'm not hungry either, Isa. In the end, water covered her mouth. Stop it! You tell all the truth with this game, right? - Plus, it's seven words. - Yes, that's seven, but they're always better. Do you think that if this gun was twice its size, I could shoot that cloud so we could see through it? No, not a chance. Hey, we've already passed this spot. You're right. - I had a nightmare. - What was it? I dreamt that I was in a car with Arturo. He was driving, and he told me I was a leper. But he had the nasty cut on his face. He was the leper. And then, I think... I think that was pretty much it. I drove the car for a while, and that was it. But I woke up feeling like telling him about it. So tell him, Isa. Tell Arturo. What did you dream? She dreamt Arturo was driving the car and they were a couple. Hey, it's cold, guys. It's not cold, Isa. Okay, let's go. Are you recording? Yes, but it's nothing. Just fooling around. Arturo, don't! - What do you plan to do with that?! - I'm giving it to Isa, so she can play house. You can cook it, if you like. Hey, you need to listen to this! - What is it, Niki? - ...pass the mate tea, Isa. This tea tastes awful. Yes, this is the right road. The sea should be right behind this... Hey, stop! Give it back! Look at that road sign. This is the road, see the way it slopes? What does it say? I'm not sure. Alright. - What are you doing? - Following my words. Are you coming or not? The slope is always the way to the sea. It's there, Sofi. In the backpack. This must be the slope. But it's not the same place! Nevermind. She's scared. I mean Isa. I know. Hey, Isa. - Isa! - What? - Listen, it's you. - ...it's there, Sofi. - Me? - ...in the backpack. Listen. - No, Niki. I can't hear a thing. - Let me see. This is not the right way, guys. Why don't we check with the map? It's there, Sofi. In the backpack. Yes, that one. - Here it is! - Let me have it. Take it. - You look at it, I'm driving. - Tell me, Sof... When did you plan to tell us about the map? I didn't know anything, I swear to God. Okay, I believe you. God is weird. - ...let's look carefully! - So where are we now? Isa, does the house face the sea? - ...no. - There's a forest here. Then we're near this lagoon, here. I think we should find it first and, I'm not sure, ...use some reference to find the house. Let's go. Yes, this is the right way. It's going to get dark. Relax, Isa. Look where we are. Get off my back! We'll go find the house later. - Let's not linger here. - Come on, Isa! Leave them be, Sofi. Let's go. My brother would kill for Isa. Did you taste it? It's salty! I'm not sure, I can't taste any salt in it. Are these lagoons salty? No, it's not possible. I'm a bit scared. You'll see, everything will be alright. - Why are you like this? - It's nothing. Arturo... You're not a Catholic, are you? I don't know. And you? Me neither. I was thinking... We know nothing about the gods. Not just the Catholic one. None of them. We know they are not like us. They are different, they are not people. Is that enough not to believe? Maybe it's just the opposite. I'm not sure. Why do you ask that? No reason. Hey, Arturo. Shall we go? Give up... truth... ...hold on to fantasy. That's seven, Sof. But anyway... Isabel bites bits of real life. Nicolas! Never told her I loved her. All I want... is wanting you. Arturo, can we go now? Me breathing doesn't mean I'm alive. Sure, boy. Niki, the guys are looking for you. Okay, I'll go right away. Sof... Let's sit down here. Did you ever picture yourself in a world where there is nothing at all? Without people, without nature, without things. Nothing at all. Like... like a desert, but without sand. What about the sky, Isa? The sky... The sky would be the sky, but there wouldn't be any stars. Just black? No color at all. For a second, I could see it. If the sun sets, we are going to get lost. This is sunrise, Isa. Quit it with that. If I get a love present from someone that I don't love, what do you call that feeling? You do care about him, don't act silly. How do you know who gave me the present? Have sex with him and you will know. Shhh, the boys are here. I'm cold, let's go. Have you noticed that 'te amo' and 'te quiero' in English are both 'I love you'? It's weird, because you say the same thing to your boyfriend, your dad, your friends. That's true. It's strange. Hey guys, my clothes! Arturo, give my clothes back! It wasn't me, but you look gorgeous like that. Stay like that. Félix... Come on, guys. It's cold, give me my clothes back. No, Isa, it wasn't me. You will have to blame someone else. It was me, I threw them but I can't remember where. - Arturo, you're a bastard! - I'm kidding, of course it wasn't me. You're a moron. Sofi, no, no, no! Isa, if I don't leave they will not give them back. Besides, it was Arturo! The water was freezing! Do you know I couldn't let any bubbles out underwater? And what about it? I feel a bit sad. How so? I'm not sad myself, I'm just worried that Isa is tripping. In the letter, there's a part about how to remove sadness. Your brother was trying to steal it obsessively. Really? Here. I will keep it safe, so he doesn't take it. I know a part of it by heart: You want sex with me to stop being sad? When I'm sad, the only thing that helps is having sex. Does it work for you? Only with love. But it also works if I burn you. But that feeling would only last a second. You wrote that a year before you met me? I didn't write it just for you. I want you, I'm not sure if I love you. I know. That's the big difference between us. I spent many nights wondering whether you loved me or not. For you, it's enough just to know how you feel. Plus, it's me who needs cheering up now. Then try what I suggest. - I'm gonna try it, Félix. - Let's see. Stop! You just want to have sex with me to feel something different, right? When I'm sad I feel like sleeping with anyone just to feel better. If that's it, I can just pull your hair or put out a cigarette in your hand and that's it. Very good! Félix! I told Isa we had sex, don't say otherwise. Niki? Yes? There's a part of the soul that enjoys without understanding. And that part is really big inside me. Yes, I can tell you're enjoying yourself... Look at that landmark, guys. It's the same place. I'm certain. What landmark, Sofia? Everything looks the same. Look around. It's exactly the same. Two apricot forests would be too much. But walking in circles is fun. Maybe I've just had enough. So what? We came here to spend time. Anyway, something is confusing us. Yes, probably the devil. And what side are you on, little devil? Sof, where did we leave mom's BMW? I think I had the keys with the little skeleton but I can't find them. Do you have them? No, I don't have them. Thanks a lot for the love letter, 'Fel'! Blow me, stupid. Where did you get it, Arturo? How old are you? 12? - You fucking idiot! - Stop it! Let's see. Let's take a look at the map. - Let me have it. - Here, take it. Come, Sofia, let's try and find another way out. Look, the flowers are drawn here. Félix, come with me! Niki... Niki! Come here! There, Sofi. In the backpack. Yes, that one. - Here it is! - Let me have it. - You look at it, I'm driving. - Sure, hand it over. Hey, let's look carefully! Isa, does the house face the sea? No. - Yes, this is the right way. - I told you. - Arturo, drive slower! - Okay, get off my back! The sea should be behind this. - Do you want me to drive? - No, don't worry. Then drive slower. Watch out for the tractor! 'Want some bread?' I give him some. We sit in the shade. The shade is my friend, too. A hen comes up, She says 'Hi', I say 'Hi'. I give her bread, she takes a joint out of her pocket. I say 'Hen, you're cool', she says 'Thanks, good bread'. Kevin smiles at me, I smile at you, Kevin. 10:50, a bonfire is made; the cow walks by, the horse, too, the guys pass by, they don't stop. 10 o'clock again; great, time moves backwards. Time is also my friend. The grass grows, clouds move; Kevin is my friend. I tell him, 'I like your hair', he says, 'I like your eyes'. I take off his t-shirt; the cow leaves, the horse leaves. 10:30, the cool hen leaves. He takes off my t-shirt, unlaces my shoes. Kevin smiles at me, I smile at you, Kevin. He takes his shoes off, he says, 'Let's switch, what's your size?' I eat bread, I put my friend's shoes on. I like your jacket, I like your horse. 10:15, the sun is my friend. The grass grows, clouds move, a God is born, it rains in town. I see Kevin against a wire fence. I speak with God, he says, 'Do this, do that'. God is my friend, this town is my boyfriend. A dirt road embraces me this morning. I drag my motorbike back, Kevin laughs at me. We're friends, I like his hair, he turns two blocks earlier, I turn two blocks later, 'Thanks for the shoes', he says, 'Thanks for your hair', I say." - What do you have there, Isa? - It's beautiful, Niki! What's that on your neck? I'm not sure how I got it. I think it's getting better. Eat one of these flowers. - Which one? This? - Mom gave them to us for belly aches or scarring. They are great. Mom gave them to us, have another one. One more? - Yes, better. - This one! There's only one forest, guys. See it was where I said it was? I did it for you, Isa. So we came in this way? Yes. No, there's a lot more space. I think we came in this way. This way. Yes. In the window frame. Right below the bushes. It should be here somewhere. Do you believe in rapture, babe? Do you believe in second chance? Do you believe in rapture, babe? - It's something like that, right? - I'm such a mess. I can't remember it, not even five lines. And Isabel? Shall we go that way? What? Sure. You're such a dumbass, Niki. Hey, guys! Hey, guys?! This fucking place... Arturo, walk slower! Get off my back! Walk slower, then. The sea should be behind this. Stop! Sofia! ...in a devil town... ...didn't know... ...it was a devil town... ...Oh, Lord... ...it really brings me down... ...about the devil town... I love how you sing, Isa. I'm gonna check the whole cassette. Testing, testing. My name is Niki. I'm gay and my friends love me anyway. I'm going in the passenger seat! Can I drive, Arturo? No, Sofia. It's dangerous. So what? Turns out I was a vampire myself. The backpacks go here? Sure, put them where you want, boy. ...Oh, Lord... ...it really brings me down... ...about the devil town... ...I was living in a devil town... I'm leaving the map in this backpack. - Take care! - Bye, have a good trip! ...it really brings me down... ...about the devil... Why don't we check the map? It's there, Sofi. In the backpack. Yes, inside that one. - Here it is. - Sofia. - Let me have it. - Here, take it. - You look at it, I'm driving. - Alright. - Yes, we are on the right road. - See? I told you. Arturo, drive slower! Get off my back! The sea should be behind this. Do you want me to drive? No. Then drive slower. Arturo, kill him. You're so stupid, Arturo! Your brother is stupid, don't mind him. What did you do, Niki? It's no longer working. Give me the map. It's no longer working.
