Luca? I know it's hard to understand but everything's gonna be fine. Okay? When we get back from holiday, Daddy's gonna move out. We're breaking up. But it's not your fault. Do you hear, Luca? We love you more than anything and will always be there for you. Nothing's ever gonna change that. The elephant will protect you even when I'm not around. Luca, you'll never lose me. Dad. DARK BLUE GIRL TWO YEARS LATER Is Mom home? - No. Okay. With milk? When will she be back? Dunno. With milk? - Yep. No way! Third late notice! - Daddy! Your coffee is ready! What's going on, hasn't she been paying any bills? Daddy! If Mom finds out you opened her mail she's gonna be really mad, you know that! Look, if I don't open the letters, nobody pays the bills and you'll end up on the street. Are we going to the movies today? I was plastering all day in the cold, I'm not going anywhere today. I'll go by myself then. Fine. Then I can watch our favorite TV show in peace: "Watergirl". What? Watergirl isn't on today! It was meant to be a surprise. But you'd rather go to the cinema. I went to see the broadcasting guys yesterday. Straight to the manager's office. He was gobsmacked. I took him and looked him straight in the eye: "Listen up, you douchebag! "I'm visiting my daughter tomorrow and I want you to show her favorite show! Capito? "A double-bill, in fact!" Hello. You've reached Hannah and Luca Papadakis. Leave your message after the beep. Hello, this is Mr. Steingrüber, I'm calling about your holiday home ad that me and my wife saw on the internet. You can call me back on 01747720536. We've been searching for a house like that on the island for a very long time and are very much interested in your offer. It'd be great if you could give us a call back. Steingrüber is my name. Bye. The message has been deleted. Hey! - Jimmy! You're here already. Nice. You've been working pretty hard, huh? Shall I cook us something nice? I thought you had plans tonight. Sometimes I just need my little family. Spaghetti? Good. Great. Jimmy! It's just for the color. Otherwise, she feels left out. I forgot the parmesan. Don't start without me, okay? Here goes! Parmesan? Do you like it? I haven't really tried it yet, Hannah. Fine. At least I like it. I'm just not a big fan of pasta, you know that. How did that casting go last week? Pretty well. - Cool. I did a great crying scene. Yeah, I bet. Hello? I asked you not to call me at home. No, wait a second. Wait, I'll put you through to the other phone, okay? Luca, could you please hang up when I'm in the other room? I won't be long, okay? You can hang up! Right, I'm here now! - Nice to hear you. I've missed you. Steffen! Wait a moment. Can you please hang up? Are you still mad at me, Hannah? - We're having dinner and Jimmy is here. I'd really like to see you. She heard me the whole time. You were rustling too much. You've gotta stay quiet! And? Let me see how everything goes tonight. Maybe I'll find the time to come meet you. Yeah. See you. Bye. It doesn't really get the glasses clean anymore. There's something wrong with it. Or maybe it just needs some salt. I don't know. I'll take a look at it. - Great. Really? Oh, that's so nice of you! Wow, Jimmy. Thank you! "Oh, thank you, Jimmy!" I've got so many bills to pay. - Then pay them! And Luca needs new trousers. - Yeah, of course! Don't you wanna sleep here tonight? I mean, it's late... No, I'm fine. I can drive home. You can sleep in Luca's room! No worries. She'd be so happy. And you'd have some more time with each other. Thanks. Jimmy? Would it be alright with you if I went out tonight after all? Sure. Thanks! Okay, my darlings, I'm gonna go. Hello? Could you at least say bye to me? Or would you rather I stayed? One times six? - Six. Two times six? - Twelve. Three times six? - 18. Four times six? - 24. Five times six? 30! 18 times 19? Need to spit! Dad? Daddy, what's going on? Get me some water! Daddy, what's wrong with you? Daddy! Daddy, what's wrong with you? What's wrong? What's going on? I don't know. I can't breathe. And then you feel dizzy. Yeah, sometimes. And you have a stabbing pain in your heart. And if it happens again, I call the fire brigade. That's right. And what do you say? Help! Hurry up! My dad's having a heart attack. And you say the address. I'm scared. Don't worry. It's just in case of an emergency. I love you. I love you too. What are you doing? I... I'm making a protective circle around you. So nothing happens to you. Guess you got that esoteric stuff from your mom, right? Okay, Luca, time to sleep now. Small steps, small steps. That's it. And now your spine. Watch out! That's it, now get up again! Keep going! Yeah, like that! Great! Really good. And now... Walk up slowly. Wow, nice. Jimmy, can you please go now? I need some time for myself now! It's too loud! Don't look at me like that! You had longer together than usual. But he can stay a bit longer! I haven't slept all night. I need some peace and quiet now. I'm going back to bed, okay? What kind of tone was that? I'm not a child she can push around. Are you jealous of Steffen and Mom? I don't give a damn about Hannah's men. I just don't want that guy settling in here. They'll probably not let me see you at all in the end. I dunno. Don't go! I'll call you tomorrow. Promise! But don't smoke! Bye! Bye! Are you still not talking to me? Luca, I'm sorry about earlier. But it was too much for me. I'm really, really sad. Steffen broke up with me. I don't care. Why? Well, it's not that easy. Everybody's got their life and if you have kids, it's not that easy to start again. It has to fit. But you've got me and Dad. Yes, but Dad and I are not a couple anymore. Steffen? - Steingrüber speaking. Yes, Papadakis. - Didn't you get my message? No, I didn't. The house? Yes, of course! It's still for sale! It's even more beautiful in reality! Do you know the island? Mom! Mom! MOM! Did you have a nightmare? Come here. I'm gonna lie down with you. Everything's okay. Go back to sleep, okay? And? The usual. Like I said. He's not picking up. I wanna go to him. Something bad's happened to him. Luca, what could've happened? You know your dad. How many times has he disappeared and not picked up? Yeah. But he promised he'd call. That was four days ago. Something's wrong, Mom. Mom, come on! Okay! Daddy! Daddy, open up! Hey, Luca! What's going on? She thought you were dead. What? Can you please let me in? Yes... Damn, Jimmy! What's going on? We called you a thousand times! Why didn't you pick up? You can't just disappear like this! Luca was so worried about you. She thought something bad had happened. What should've happened? I was working and fell asleep. Yeah, but you promised her! Don't tell me you didn't hear the phone. Luca was worried about you! I'm sorry. Oh man. Look at the state of this place. You still don't have a mirror. I work all day, I can't be bothered to do anything in the evenings. No need to get worked up. Everything's fine. I've got really great news! I found a buyer for the house. A really nice couple. They absolutely want to buy it. We need to go there during Luca's holidays and renovate and tidy up the house. I can't go. I have to work. Someone has to pay the rent. Damn it, Jimmy! Don't you get it? We're selling the house! We'll get money. We'll be done with all the financial pressure and have air to breathe again! You wanna get rid of me? - Rubbish! We've gotta go there, the three of us. We'll have a great time. - Come on, Mom! Let's go. Hey, Luca! Besides, I need you. I'll give you a call, okay? Bye. Wow! It's so nice. Dad, come on! Daddy! Everything alright, Dad? All good, Luca. Come on! Mom, how do you say "help" in Greek? And how do you say "heart attack"? When did you say the buyers are coming? I need to call them again. What shall we start with tomorrow? I'm gonna do the doors. And I'll muck out the back room. Let's see what we find in there. Daddy, how long is it since you were here? Don't know. Since we broke up. Hannah? Two, two and a half years ago? You were five. - Five. Pretty young. You can sleep upstairs, in the small room. No! I wanna sleep with Dad in the big bed! Right! You're gonna sleep with me. I think it's about time Luca learnt to sleep on her own. Daddy, do you love me? Endlessly. Your heart is beating so fast. Now sleep well. Wake up! Get up! Breakfast's ready. We've got so much to do today. Come on, get up! Yeah, this is the corner. Oh, damn it! - What's wrong now? Come on! I'm coming! - Fine. Can you stop yelling at me the whole time? Hannah! Careful, there's a step! - I can see the step! Luca! Out of the way! Move it, Luca! This is heavy! But you told me to sweep! Wait! - Yep... Wait, slowly. - Yes, I'm doing it slowly. This is boring. Then go out front. Maybe the other kids are there. Okay, you got it? - Yes. Luca? I know it's hard to understand but everything's gonna be fine. Okay? When we get back from holiday, Daddy's gonna move out. We're breaking up. But it's not your fault. Do you hear, Luca? Dad! Hey, sweetie. Are you back? Where's Dad? He's having a shower. A shower? Dad, I want to sit next to you. Today I'm sitting next to Jimmy. But that's mean. - Next time it's your turn again, okay? We'll toss for it, okay? You're super tired, aren't you? No, I'm not tired. Come on, let's go to bed. - No. Maybe I'll put you to bed today. No, I want Daddy to take me. You go ahead. No, only if you come with me. Since when do the kids decide at what time adults go to bed? Are you coming? You know what? You go ahead and I'll follow, okay? No, only if you come. I will come. In three seconds. You go ahead. Okay. Daddy! Come! I'm on my way! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two... time's nearly up! One! Dad, are you coming? Dad? Where are you going? You sleep. I'm just getting some water. Can I have some too? I've got to go back soon. Did she see us? I think so. Should I go talk to her? And tell her what? What should I tell her? DAD! I need to go back inside. I'll sneak out once she's asleep. Alright. See you in a bit. - See you in a bit. Luca? Have you seen Luca? - No. Luca? Dad! Luca? Dad! I'm here! Luca, come out! Daddy! But I'm here! Luca, come out! - Dad. Luca? Daddy, it's me! - Luca, this isn't funny! Hannah, have you seen Luca? - No, no idea. Let's eat something. But I'm here... - There you are! Daddy? I can't really remember when you were together. Really? Why did you break up? Well, Daddy turned further and further away from me. And I felt lonely. So, we both said it was better to split up. But Daddy said you broke up because... you thought you could find something better. You know, Luca, I would love for us to be a family again. Wouldn't that be nice? Dad and Mom love each other again. Luca, have you seen my sunglasses? No! Did you try Vangelis's shop downstairs? Yes, they don't have it. I have to go to Athens. But I need some paint anyway. When are you leaving? The day after tomorrow. Luca, you're annoying! - Daddy! Come on. I'll take you to bed. No, I want Dad to take me. But Dad wants to sleep in my bed tonight. Mmh, mmh! - Yes, Luca. No! Let's go, Luca! No! Come on. Let's go, sweetie. Come on, get up. Let's go. Come on. Luca, that's enough! - But Daddy! Enough. Dad and I want to spend some time together too. Mean. Off you go. - Let's go. Dad! Let's go, Luca. Come on, get up! Stop this right now! That's enough now! Go now! - Daddy. Luca, come on! Let's go! This is ridiculous! Luca! Come on! Let's go! Enough now! Daddy, are you coming? No! Stop it right now! Down here. That's enough. Turn around! Down the stairs. That's right. Do you remember when Luca was small and tried to run up the big hill? Mom, Dad, I can't sleep. Come here. Get inside the blanket. Luca, sweetie, we love you so much. Luca, how would you feel about us not selling the house after all? I don't care. I wanna go home. You can't sleep? Come, Daddy. Let's all sleep together in the big bed, okay? Let's go. Come on, Luca. Careful, I'm gonna push you up. See you in a bit. See you in a bit. Good night, sweetie. Sleep well. We'll join you later, okay? Fancy going to the beach? Good idea. I'm gonna paint the door, then we can go. Can I give you a hand? - Sure. No! I'm gonna help Dad! Not you! Daddy? Do you still love me? Of course. Who do you love more? Me or Mom? I love you both. But I love you more than Mom. What about you? Do you love me more than Mom too? I love you both. You have to choose. I chose, so you choose too! Hey! I love you more. And why not Mom? Because you're the most important thing there is! But you don't love me like you love Mom. Sure I love you. I love you differently, But I love you infinitely. What... how do you mean different? Well, Mom is grown up like me and we've known each other for many years. And now we love each other again. - No. But you... - You're not allowed to love each other. Luca, listen. The only thing I really want is to be with you. Whether you believe me or not. So why are you with Mom then, if you want to be with me? Because we get on again. And that's nice. No, it's not. I want everything to be like before and us to sleep in our bed without Mom. Mom, I'm cold! I'm tired and my tummy is sore. And I feel sick! I wanna go home! We're finishing our cappuccino first. Can I have another ice cream? - You already had one. Mom, please! - I thought you were cold! Yes, but... - And your tummy is sore. I still want one. - No, Luca. I still want one! - Luca, enough now! Daddy, can you buy me another ice cream? - No means no. I'll get it myself with my pocket money! You stay right here! Enough now! That's mean! - Luca! You're stupid! And silly! And dumb! I hate you! I'm sorry I was so tough on you. Luca. Do you know what we're gonna do tomorrow? We're going to the beach. Just the two of us. And I'll buy you an ice cream. What do you think? - I don't care. Luca! Right. We can go. Let's go! Luca! You stay here! Let her go! Jimmy! Kiss my ass! When I don't come back you'll regret this forever! If she's not back in five minutes she won't know what hit her! Calm down. She just has to let out all her anger. She needs it. I was the same as a child. I imagined I was dead and pictured my parents sitting by my grave, crying. Feeling guilty because they'd treated me so badly. Dad! Calm down! She'll be back soon. - I'm gonna go look for her. Luca, where have you been?! Luca, where have you been? I told you she'd come back. Is it here? I think so. Jimmy, come! They want 500 euros. Mom, are we out of cornflakes? Good morning, sweetie. Good morning. Look what I found. Your old toys. If you push the handle, it's funny. You remember? Okay, wait. You're right. Where's Dad? He just left. He had to go to Athens. Just now? Daddy! Wait! Daddy! Is it nice? What do you want to do for your birthday tomorrow? Don't know. When's Daddy coming back? Mom? Yes? I need to tell you something. But promise not to cry or be mad at me. Okay. I promise. I think... you're not my mom. What are you talking about? Well... we don't look the same. And there are no photos of us. Of course there are photos of us. - But why haven't I seen any? You know what, Luca? I am your mother and I had you in my belly, and I gave birth to you and I remember it all very well. But I think I was swapped after birth. I was just swapped. I think you took the wrong child. And so Dad isn't your real dad either? No, Dad is Dad! That's what's so strange. I don't know why but I can feel it. That's just how it is, I think you're not my mom. Mom! Mom, wait! Mommy? Mom, I can't sleep. Can I come sleep with you? I'm sorry, Mom. "Dear Luca, happy birthday! "I had to leave for a bit just to be by myself for a bit. "Don't be mad. Mom. "See you later." Hey, Luca! Why are you sitting there all alone? Hey! Birthday girl! Happy birthday! Where's Mom? I don't know. She just left. What? Has she been gone long? - Yes. We had a big fight. But that's no reason to leave you alone. It is. I was really mean to her. Luca, listen, if you don't want us to be together, then... I'll leave it. Come here. Shall we go inside? Yes? Okay. Celebrate my birthday... - Let's celebrate your birthday now! Then I pull them up... Oh, look how tall they've grown! Hey, Luca, sweetie! Happy, happy birthday to you. Thank you for the cake! You're welcome. Right! You haven't even lit the candles yet. Where have you been? Can we please talk about that later? Right... One, two, three, four... Hot, hot. Five, six, seven, eight. The big eight. Make a wish! Done? - Yes, I made a wish. What? I'm not gonna tell or it won't come true. - No, don't tell. Luca, you were born eight years ago. And you know what's funny about that? You were conceived here on this island. And you were absolutely planned. I tried to get pregnant for a long time, but it never worked. I was very unhappy, and then I got pregnant with you. And that was the absolute best for me. And after that you were born. But the birth was very difficult for me. Because I nearly died. And I lost a lot of blood. The doctors had to take care of me, and you were lying there alone and helpless. First I wasn't allowed to see you, or hold you in my arms. But Dad was there. And Dad took you in his arms. He took care of you. And I was only allowed to see you three days later. So... that's why I feel... that that's the reason you love Dad more than me. I'm going to bed. Luca, you can stay up. It's your birthday. Stay up a little, Luca. I'm tired already. Do you want me to come with you? I'll be alright on my own. Good night. - Good night, sweetheart. Sweet dreams. What time is it? I don't know. What's wrong? I can't do this, Hannah. I thought I wanted it. But... And now? I don't know. Is Luca up already? I don't think so. I'll give you a call, okay? - Yep. Bye, Luca! See you next week! Luca, let's go!
