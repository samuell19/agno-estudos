Can't come to the phone 'cause I'm doing something epic! Leave your deets at the beep! Donna, it's Nicky. It's an emergency - I need you to call 911 because my phone is broken... No message detected. - If you'd like to leave a message, - Seriously? Press one, or press two to disconnect. Hey, bitches! Can't come to the phone 'cause I'm doing something epic! Leave your deets at the beep! Donna, it's Nicky. It's an emergency. I need you to call 911. I've been in an accident. Oh, um... Wait. My, um, My location is, um... Um, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know where we are, but just - just call me as soon as you get this, please. - Yes? - Oh, thank God! - I, I've been in an accident...- You're gonna have to speak up. - I've been in an accident...- Hang on... Turning up my earpiece... Yes? I've been in an accident! - I need help...- Accident? - Give me that phone. - Accident my foot! You dirty crooks stole our credit card number last time. - Well, not this time! - Wait, what are you... What are you talking about? I... Goddamn foreigners! No, you don't understand! I need your help! - I've been in an acci...- You people call here again - and we're calling the cops! - Yes! Yes, please call the cops! Please! What? No! No, no, no! No, no, no! Martha, just ignore them. Hang up! Hang u... Okay. Mistress Dark Kitten of the night. What's your pleasure, giving or receiving pain? Is there anybody normal? I'm gonna kill whoever this is. Please don't hang up! Please, I-I... I've been in an accident, - I'm in the middle of nowhere...- Whoa, whoa, whoa... Slow down. Who is this? My name is Nicole Diamond... you know, the model... and I, I don't know... Everything's a mess - and everything's upside down... Okay, slow down, slow down! Christ! I just woke up... How many people in the accident? Two. Me and Scotty. Please, you have to help me. You have to help me! - Please!- Listen, I'm gonna help. I just need you to calm down, okay? Okay. Okay. Thank you. Do you have any idea where you are? Um... Um... I'm in a really bad situation. Okay, well, just tell me what happened. Was it a blowout or someone hit you or what? I... I don't remember - Yeah, Yeah, someone hit me. I don't... - Something's burning!- Okay. Are you hurt? Umm... Umm... I can't... I don't... I don't know. I can't feel my legs. They're pinned. It's... It's like they're stuck, you know? I... I... They're stuck. Please, you have to call 911. - You have to help!- Look outside. Do you see any landmarks? Anything familiar? No, it's all... It's all barren. Please, you have to help me. My legs... My legs... Listen, your legs are losing circulation. All the blood's going to your head, which means you could get a blood clot. Now, we need to handle that first. Can you ease the seat back? I can try. Okay, hang on, because the door's banged in, so just hang on. Okay, all right. I'm gonna put you on my hands-free, but it's been broken. So just tell me if you can hear me, okay? Okay, can you hear me? Hello? Shit. Can you hear me? Ah, barely. Hang on. Let me turn up the volume on this thing. Okay, say something. Okay, I have a mirror in my purse. I'm gonna see if I can use it to move the seat button, okay?- Hello? Can you reach the... Hello? You cut out. Fuck! Hello?! Fuck. ♪ The bell in the sound ♪ ♪ Is ringing ♪ ♪ Is ringing ♪ ♪ Just lying around ♪ ♪ Only lying around ♪ ♪ Kids are singing ♪ ♪ All the kids are singing ♪ Yes! ♪ It doesn't matter to me - Oh, oh ♪ Nicole? Hi! Is that the car radio? Oh, yeah, I didn't... I... I needed company. Want to join our party? You're wasting the battery. ♪ When the sun rises, baby ♪ Do you have any wiggle room? I don't know. My legs are numb. Try to get your shoes off. Okay. Hang on, I... I have to put you on hands-free. Okay - okay, they're off. All right, good. Now massage your legs. Start with the thigh and move downward. Hey, did you call the cops yet? Hang on, hang on. I gotta adjust the volume. - Are you massaging? - Yeah. - All right, good, good, good. - It's so cold...- This will help get blood circulating. You know, the human body's not designed to be upside down for long periods of time. You're not a bat. You know, it could put a real strain on your heart. Getting blood to the head, that's maybe 12 inches, but, um, up to your feet? Got to be four times that distance. I mean, look, I'm no scientist, but gravity's your enemy when you're upside down. Well, as a model, I guess, uh, gravity's always your enemy. But, you know, I digress. I'm just saying there's a danger in sitting still. We've got to get those legs moving. Remember that inaction is action. Are you moving your legs? Nicole, are you there? Nicole? Hello? Nicole, are you there? What the hell's going on? Are you okay? There was... There was, I don't know... I don't know. A wolf. Listen, you got no circulation in your legs. If we wait any longer, they'll need to be amputated. So, in the future, when you call up strangers, you'll have to say, "This is Nicole Diamond, the legless model." Is that what you want? I could... I could lose my legs? Aside from blood clots, stroke, and death, yeah. We need to get them moving. Do you understand? Do you want my help or not? Because I'll just hang up. Yes, please. Help me. Are your shoes off? - Yes.- All right, good. Now try wiggling your toes and tell me if you feel anything. Wait... Feels like pins and needles. Is that bad? No, that's good. Keep doing that and move your legs, like you're walking. I'll... I'll try, but... Okay. Were you able to call the cops before? Help is on the way. Now, keep moving your legs. Okay. Okay, I can feel it. - It's like electric.- That's good. The pins and needles will pass. Sorry about, uh, the yelling. I'm... I'm sorry, too. You have a really nice voice. I didn't even ask your name. What's yours? I already told you. Mine's Nicole. Yeah, I know, but... are you the real Nicole Diamond? As in, half of Diamond-Dee? The better half, yeah. I swear I am. Name your favorite candy bar. What? Why? And, let's see... What's your cat's name? And what's the only gum you'll ever chew? Okay. My favorite candy bar is Snickers, my cat's name is Napoleon, and I'm endorsed by Big Softie to say that they're my favorite even though they're really not. Your turn. What's your name? You may not believe this, but we share the same name. Your name is Nicole? No, it's Casey. I Wikipedia'd you, and your real name is Casey Skylar, right? Gee, that Interweb sure is smart. Okay, so, what do you look like, Casey? Wait - Let me guess. You are tall, but not too tall, and you have dark hair. Do you always introduce yourself as "Nicole Diamond, the model"? What? No. Did I do that? Maybe you thought it would get you special attention, you know, for the supermodel woman? Supermodel woman. I wish. Um... Casey, why haven't the cops called me? You didn't have a signal. Remember? Oh. Yeah. Do you have call waiting? Yeah. But you'll keep a lady company until they call? Oh, sure. No problem. So, like, when we get through this, will you let me take you out? I mean, maybe, like, for coffee or something? You know I have a boyfriend, right? Yeah, that awesome guy Scott. I'm just kidding. People don't always get my sense of humor. Yeah. It's just, you know, people say, um, a lot of things about Scotty, you know. Yeah, I know. But yes to coffee. I'd like that. Cool! So, of all the people in the whole wide world, why'd you call me? Well, if you want to know the truth, my phone is broken. Certain keys were sticking, so I dialed you at random. Well, there you go. We were destined to meet, and, hey, you never know, you might end up falling in love with me and dumping Scott, right? Yes, we can all dream, can't we? I was... I was joking. That was my sense of humor. I'm sorry. Don't underestimate dreams. I'm just messing with you. C'mon! Cool, cool, cool. I can't wait to tell my friends I'm dating a fuckin' celebrity. Wait. Dating? I'm just... I'm just a regular person, just like you. Oh, well, thanks for the clarification. I was beginning to think I was talking to God herself. That's some crazy sense of humor you got there. You really needed to point out that you're a regular person, the same way you pointed out that you're a model? Do you think you can try calling the cops again? Because despite what you think, you're no different or better than me. Who the fuck do you think you are anyway? Oh! Oh, I hear the... I hear the cops! What? Oh, Casey, thank you so much! Thank you for everything! Really, I really appreciate it, but I have to go. Oh, I see. Yeah, sure. Just a ploy to get me off the phone, right? No! No, I really hear them, and I... I have to go! I want to be ready for them, - so I... I...- What the hell does that mean? Putting on makeup so you can bat your false eyelashes for that special model treatment? Wait, where are they going? Where did it... Where'd it go? Wait. Wait. Where did I put my... Where did I... Casey, did you really call the cops? So, now you don't trust me, is that it? Did you call the cops? You keep asking, so obviously you don't trust me! Where did I put... Where the fuck did I put... Did you call the fucking cops? I said... help... is on... the way. Oh, so now I get the silent treatment. Hmm. You obviously have some trust issues. Pretty odd considering who you do find trustworthy. I'm sorry, I do trust you. You're obviously just trying to help. You see, that's your problem, Nicole. You apologize too easily. Get a spine. Have some pride! Where's the fight in you? Well, you must have none, choosing and sticking with a piece of shit like Scotty Douche-bag. Okay, you don't know him like I know him, okay? - He's a good person.- Unbelievable. You know he cheated on you, right? Yeah, what tabloid told you that? Okay, you keep defending this "model" citizen, and I'll play prosecutor. Let's see... Scotty Dee's rap sheet. Five years ago, your boyfriend, Scotty Dee, a.k.a. Scott Wilbur Donnolly... Wilbur! Was arrested for assault on his then-girlfriend Brooke Fenty. He wasn't charged for that. Correct! Charges were dropped when she received death threats. Can't imagine where those came from. A year after that, his fiance had a bizarre accident with a steak knife when she was stabbed in the arm. Fortunately, she never pressed charges against the steak, but sadly, the engagement was called off two weeks later. He wasn't charged for that either, okay? - The press likes to blow this stuff up.- Two years ago, a passerby videotaped him in his car beating his girlfriend. He pleaded no contest and got two years probation. No contest means he never admitted guilt! Jesus, woman! He'll never admit guilt 'cause he thinks he's a great guy! 'Cause people like you tell him that. - You want me to go on? - No. One year ago, assault on... I get it. Please. Nicole Diamond. Charges dropped. You're his enabler. What, am I on trial now? You don't see a bit of a pattern here? I mean, he finds women who enjoy abuse. - I don't enjoy...- He beats them up, He gets away with it, because nobody stops him. Including you! Scotty's good to me. Does he profess his love for you as he gazes into your black eyes? - Okay...- Is that how he's good to you? Does he caress your bruised arms and your cut-up face? Stop it. Does he kiss your bleeding fat lips? - Stop it!- You're telling me there isn't a single part of you that wants to scream out - that what he did was wrong? - Please stop! Please! Either put him down like a rabid fuckin' dog, or admit that you love the abuse. Even from me. You love this, don't you? You could hang up, but you hit the jackpot with me, didn't you, lady? What a disappointment. The great Nicole Diamond is just an abuse-loving pushover. You weak, little bully. I'm hanging up. You sure you want to do that? You know, as blood pools in the head, the pressure builds and pop goes the blood vessel. Then we're talking stroke, brain damage, or the whole shebang... death. Go ahead. Dial more random numbers or wait for a friend or a family member to call. In any case, it could be too late. How long? The world's greatest illusionist went for the world record in being suspended upside down for 60 hours, but his doctor insisted that he take breaks every hour on the hour. Can you imagine the disappointment when people learned that he'd be taking breaks in the middle of setting a world record? The truth is, no one knows how long a human can be upside down before they die. Could be days, maybe hours or minutes, especially if you've got an aneurysm. I mean, forget it if you've got an aneurysm. - It's over. - Look, are you telling the truth, because you're really scaring me. Look it up for yourself. Your phone have a browser? I'd say you have nothing to worry about. But of course I'd be lying. In reality, you have a lot to worry about. Casey, can you please just have the cops call me please? - I told you... - No, I... I don't understand. How can they be on their way when I never told you where I am? I never said I called the police. I said help is on the way. And guess what, Nicole? I'm the help. No, no, no, no, no, no, no... You need more help than I do, you sick, twisted fuck! Hello? Hello? Casey? Oh, I'm sorry. Was I ignoring you? Kind of like a hot chick? Too good for all the nice guys out there? Well, the tides have turned, Nicole. Now I'm the hot chick. Watch this. Are you watching? You see that? I'm looking everywhere else but at you. Oh, look! There's a real hottie! No, no, no, no, not you. Oh, look, look, look. Another hottie. You sick bastard. How's it feel to be ignored? To be invisible? Like a freakin' leper. - Casey... - If I was the last man on Earth, maybe, just maybe, you'd give me a chance. Well, guess what, Nicole? As far as you're concerned, I am the last man on Earth. Casey, I'm dying out here. And I'm not? You want my help? You be the nice guy. You be polite and well-meaning, where the thought of abusing a woman never crosses your mind, and I'll be the hot chick. Go ahead, pick me up. Give me your best game. You're serious. Dead. - Casey, there isn't any time!- Go ahead. Muster up the courage to bust a move. Make me feel special. Woo me. Woo you? Be careful, though. I can be quite the ice queen. Hey, you look nice... Casey, this is stupid! I... I don't know what you want me to say. Please, can you just call the cops? Just say hi and ask me out on a date. It's really not that hard. Hey, do you want to hang out sometime? Piss off. Casey? Casey? Casey, please don't leave me! Please... Wake... Wake up Sc... Wake up, please! We're gonna die. We're gonna die. We're gonna die. We're gonna die. We're gonna die. We're gonna die. ♪ You make me wanna scream, you make me wanna shake ya ♪ ♪ You make me wanna scream, you make me wanna shake ya ♪ ♪ Talkin' about shakin', well, look who got shook ♪ ♪ I be dippin' through your town, brah ♪ ♪ Just to get a look, my man's swervin', pervin' ♪ ♪ Servin' on fiends about them hype dreams ♪ ♪ The pipe dreams and hood schemes ♪ ♪ You make me wanna make you stop ♪ ♪ You make me wanna just blow my top ♪ ♪ You make me wanna... ♪ ♪ When the sun rises, baby ♪ ♪ I hope you're near... ♪ ♪ You make me wanna shout ♪ Hello?

If you don't help me, I'm gonna die out here, and that would make you a murderer, and you're not a murderer, right? You're a nice guy, right? How did it feel? The rejection? I'll be it's a whole new sensation for you. I got the keys in my hand right now. I'm just waiting for you to pick me up. So, let's go, player! - Casey...- Get your best rap on. Like you'd say to Scott... hit me with your best shot. Okay, for our date, I'm gonna wear the hottest outfit. And do you like bangs? 'Cause I can wear 'em, or I can push 'em to the side. What, red lipstick? What?! So pathetic. Is it money, Casey? What do you want? Well, I'll gladly take your credit card number. I'll order a nice expensive meal, some wine, plus dessert, you know... they always get dessert. I'm not joking, Casey. I'll buy you a car. I'll buy you a goddamn house. All I asked for was to have coffee. Fine! I'll give you sex! I didn't say sex. I said coffee. Like there's a difference. Wow! Have you gone out with anyone but scumbags, ever? I just wanted to spend some time with you, get to know you, but I guess that concept is totally foreign to you. Fine. Let's go for coffee, okay? Do we have a deal? Well, let me ponder that. In the mean time, I'm gonna help myself to a nice, thirst-quenching can of soda. Ahh... frosted mug. Ahh! Excuse me. You're unbelievable. My fridge is full of goodies. I can get whatever I want. Just like you and Scotty Dee. No effort. All served on a silver platter. I'm sorry, did I scare you? That was me punching my bag of potato chips. Pow, bitch! Congratulations. You just killed a bag of potato chips. No, Nicole. I just made this bag a little less pretty. Just messed up its crinkle cut. But don't worry, it'll keep quiet. - They always do. - Shh. But come on, let's forget my past. I'll just toss it out and get a new one. You know, change up the flavor. Barbecue or salt and vinegar or some shit. It's got to suck hearing somebody pigging out when you're starved, right? You're just stuck there in that metal frame like a cripple, living life through the eyes of a nice guy. Casey, shut up. Shut up, Casey! Shut up! What'd you say? What did you say? You tell your only hope for help... Oh, God. To shut up? You and me, we're connected. We're one. You can't silence me! But I sure as shit can silence you. Shh. Shh. Hey, Nicole, you know what? I said, you know what? I won't be ignored. Nicole? Oh, Nicole? Hey! Answer me! Answer me or I'll hang up. I said, you know what? Okay, I'm hanging up. Don't hang up! You said "shut up," and you know what? You know what? What? - You've hurt my feelings. - I'm hurt. Oh, I... kill me. There was a fucking snake in here, Casey. I'm in serious danger. All you have to do is lift a finger to help, and you won't. You call yourself a good person. Oh, come on. Like you're not used to being around a snake? And why should I help you when you've done nothing to help anyone else? Are you kidding? Yeah, like striking a pose in front of a camera makes the world a better place? No, but obviously Wikipedia doesn't talk about all the charity events I plan, all the people that I help. I'm a good person. I would never do what you're doing to me. What I do do is that I...- What's so fucking funny? You said "doo-doo"! And you wonder why you're alone. Yeah. You really think you know me. Look, I'm s... I'm so sorry that you've had some bad experiences, but that means that you know me? I know you. Flirting to score free drinks. Giving out fake numbers. How about doing the occasional dinner date and never calling the guy back? I don't... Wait. Wait, not calling a guy back after a bad date is insensitive? When the guy buys you dinner and pays for your valet, yeah, it's insensitive! Okay, a girl goes on a date for one reason. To see if there's chemistry, that's it. If a guy expects anything more, it's rude. It's also rude if a girl tells a guy that she's not interested in him when the more sensitive thing to do would be to just not call him back. You leave a guy with his dick swinging in the wind and you call that sensitive? I call that convenient. And cowardly. Okay. I guess you're right. I... I never saw it that way. See? The male perspective helps! M... Maybe I can help you, too. Well, you're stuck in a wreck. How in the hell are you gonna help me? Maybe you're just lacking female perspective. You know? Maybe you need, like, a mentor. A wingwoman or a coach. Well, how charitable of you. I'm serious! Think about it, the two of us, hitting the singles scene together... I can introduce you to some amazing people. Hmm... All right. That could work. Okay! Great! We can even do it tonight. So, what do you... What do you say? I say, uh... Out... standing! I... love it! Just answer one question. Why did you choose Scott? Oh, come on, Casey! - No, no, no, no, no, no. - I want to know. You blow off nice guys all the time, and you choose an asshole like Scott. Now help me understand why, and I promise I'll get you out. I... already told you, okay? We went out a couple times, he was charming and polite. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. You knew his history. It was all public. And what, you just choose to ignore it, and you go out with him? I don't get it. I didn't ignore it, okay? People love to make up stories, for headlines in tabloids... let's say a certain type of woman, for a paycheck. Everybody extorts from talent. "Talent." Auto-tune on my ass would sound better than Scotty Dee. And you're saying, even a well-established pop singer, like Fenty, wanted to extort from that piece of white trash? Okay, he told me about the Fenty thing, okay? He... He lost his temper, which he never did before. And you believed him. Are you kidding? He made a mistake! A mistake? Are you fucking kidding me? - Okay, not a mistake. - What I meant... What I meant is that he lost control. He... he... nobody's perfect! Not even you. And, uh, plus he was much younger then, anyway. We're not talking about eating fucking paste. Fenty was no angel either, okay? Nicky, I saw the photos. Nothing could ever justify what he did to that woman. Okay. So, what, so he should be shunned for life? Have you ever heard of forgiveness? Let me ask you something. Should a killer be forgiven? A... A killer? What, you're comparing a killer to... to someone with anger issues? I mean, he went to anger management. There's no such thing as murder management. Okay, how about this. Um... A guy hits a woman, but he doesn't kill her. No, that's too extreme. But he causes enough head trauma to make her a vegetable. Is that forgivable? What's your point? Okay, so she's not a fucking vegetable. She's disfigured for life. How about that? Forgivable? Does that make him boyfriend material? Where do you draw the line, Nicole? That's my point! Where do you draw the fucking line? Here's a simple question. Is it ever okay for a non-threatened man to strike a woman? No, I thought that... You thought you could fix him? As if that's even possible. You need to fix yourself. So, wha... So, what do you want me to say? You want me to say that I made a mistake by dating Scotty? I want you to tell me what you believe, especially now, in hindsight, knowing he never showed an ounce of remorse. I guess I should have used better judgment. Yes, I made a mistake. Oh, good, good, good. Now we're making progress. When you look at him now, do you see the same charming guy you met? No. I see a damn pig. Now you're talking my language! You know, you could cover up his face and make him suffocate. Or use some glass and just cut his neck. No one's gonna know. He died in the wreck, right? Yeah, I could... but that's not me. Even though he hurt me, I should just walk away. He's only gonna do it to someone else. He needs to be stopped. Nice guy or piece of trash? He's trash. Just a piece of trash? No. He's a goddamn, son of a bitch, lying piece of trash. And what about that smirk? That fucking smirk? I hate that smirk. You really hate him? Yes. Really? Yes! I fucking hate him! I hate him! Let me hear you scream it! I fucking hate him! That's my girl! Please, please, please... please help me. Scott? Scotty! Scotty, are you okay, babe? Baby, are you okay? Oh, my God! I love you so much. We're gonna be okay... Oh, my God... Oh my... Oh, my God... Scotty's... dead. He's... gone. As are you to me, you lying bitch. He's gone. He's gone. Oh, stupid! Okay... Come on. Dead. Okay, okay... Hello? Hello? - Katie, it's me. - I'm coming over. What the fuck are you doing? I'm getting out of here. - You ain't going nowhere, bitch! - Ow, stop it! Scotty, stop, you're hurting me! No! Fucking cunt! You ain't going nowhere! Stop, please, Scotty... Stop. Shut the fuck up! Shit! Why'd you make me do that, Nicole? Why? Was that what you'd call, "a mistake"? Where did you find that? A better question is, why did your BFF post her voice mail on the Internet? She's not my best friend. She's not a friend at all. You don't have many friends, do you, Nicole? I mean, we've been on the line like kids in high school, but not a soul has called you this whole time. This may be going out on a limb here, but, um... I actually think I'm your only friend. Imagine that. Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. You're not a friend. You let Scotty die. You're a piece of shit. It's called isolation. Whatever. Well, that's what they do, these guys who beat women. They isolate you. Let me guess... That house you guys bought? I bet Scott picked it out, right? And it just happened to be way out in the sticks, far away from your family and friends, right? I know where you were headed, and I know why you crashed. A tiny jerk of the wheel, gliding off the beaten path... You know, there are easier ways to avoid going home. Think whatever you want. You want to know what I think? I think your friend tried to let you in on the dark little secret that you're in an abusive relationship. But being in denial and all, you didn't listen. So, she posted it online, sacrificing your friendship for your own good. Extreme problems call for extreme measures. Yeah? And what extreme measures are you willing to take for me, Casey? Heh. Yep. Exactly what I thought. What you played was a stupid little fight that meant nothing, between Scotty and I. Okay? Welcome to our home, minus the part about being welcome. You call that a stupid little fight? Who are you trying to kid, me or yourself? I called my friend to come pick me up, Scotty didn't want me to leave, so, she sold the message to tabloids for her own personal gain. According to this article, your friend didn't make any deals or even a dime. She quote, unquote, "Just wanted to help Nicole." Yeah. Funny hearing that from the same person who let Scotty... Die. Stop jerking me off, Casey, okay? Are you gonna help me or am I hanging up?! Listen, I've been straight with you this whole time. Can you say the same thing? I swear, from here on out, no more lying. I asked you to answer one simple question. - And I did!- And because you lied, you get a penalty question. A pen... A penalty question? Fuck this, I'm hanging up. I'm calling anybody... The first person who answers, - I don't care!- Bullshit! You just lied again. You can't dial dick! That right, I'm calling your bluff. Now, I asked you why you chose to date Scott, knowing his history of beating up women. I already told you. And now for the bonus round! Bing! This is the very last question you need to answer... Unless you fucking lie again. And then, I will help you. Contestants ready? Here goes! Why did you choose to stay with him? - Because...- But hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on. This is a multi-part question. Well, it's... It's really... it's really one question, in two parts. Just tell me, was that recording the first time you got hit? Define "hit." Okay, you say you don't want to play games. God damn it, Casey, do I sound like I'm playing games? Scotty's dead. Is that a fucking game to you? No. No, it wasn't the first time he hit me. Okay, now you can happily give me all sorts of shit for sticking with a guy that beat me. This must be the best day of your life. I fell right into your trap. You win. You, you're a real man. A true hero. Are you all done with your hissy fit? I hate you. You hate the truth. Remember Nicole, you called me. I called for help. I'll help you! Just answer the damn question! Scotty was, as they say, too good to be true. He centered his world around me. He's what any girl wants... Amazing. I had a swimsuit shoot in Paris with a male model. He flew out and surprised me. He must have loved the sight of that. Actually, he was nice... until we got back to the hotel suite, and... then he flipped. He said that I was out of control. You... were out of control? He didn't like the way that I looked at the male model, but I told him that he was gay and he was. And the next day, the shoot was cancelled. Listen, I must be stupid for thinking you're intelligent. I mean, what kind of moron - sticks with a... - Don't you see how you're just like him? What, are you kidding? Am I pummeling you to a bloody pulp Yes! Yeah, you are! I'm stuck in the middle of nowhere and you let Scotty die. You're doing the same to me! I'm trying to help you live! You're just too goddamn stubborn to see it! Sometimes words hit harder than fists. Face it, you're an abuser. - Don't even... - No! You sit there on the phone like the man behind the curtain, but it's the same cycle with twisted fucks like you. Let's psychoanalyze you for a change, huh? Let's get inside the mind of the abuser! What's your deal? What's your story? You don't want to know my story. Oh, yes I do. You really want to go there? Really? Fine. I present to you the portrait of the perfect American family. Mother was a businesswoman. Father was old school, blue collar, the kind who provides. The kind who doesn't like the bitch being the breadwinner. The kind who... ensures the bitch isn't, and never will be, the breadwinner. Oh, he did a real number on us. Yep. But what the hell did I know? I was just an ugly, zit-faced kid. I couldn't walk away. But you can. I'm sure that you weren't ugly. Trust me, I was ugly. And if I ever forgot that, it was pounded back into my fucking head. I got the hell out of that hellhole as soon as I could. The end. Did you like my story, Nicole? Because, guess what... It's yours. You're staring down the barrel of your future. Do you ever speak to them now? The bottle did Father in. Such a sad, sorry, son of a bitch. And Mother? Sure. In emergencies. Otherwise, hell no! And you know why? Because she took it. She could've walked away at any time, but the dumb bitch stayed, and she took it. She just fucking took it! These pricks, they roam the planet because of people like her. And you. You nurture them. You enable them. You help them thrive! "In sickness and in health, 'til death do us part." Does it make someone a bad person or a "dumb bitch" just because they stood by their man? Because they were loyal, even if it was to a fault? Did you ever talk to her about him? Casey? Hello? Listen, that's enough psychoanalysis for this "session." Actually, forever. Goodbye, Nicole. You should have spoken to her. How'd you know it was me calling? I mean, what about your girlfriends, or your family that you alienated? You never knew what it was like from her perspective. You only thought you knew. I guess, for them, it was like watching a loved one hooked on heroin. Didn't matter what they said or did, the girl kept using, despite the harm. You're clearly incapable of helping anyone, and tragically, that includes yourself. You should have listened to what she had to say. Casey, I... I gotta call you back. What? What the hell's going on? Is someone else calling? Yes, actually, a friend, believe it or not. I gotta go. Tell them you'll call back And don't say anything else or I'm not helping you. - You hear me? - Yeah, right, not gonna help me. Call 'em back. Got it! Donna? Nicky? Oh, my God! Thank God. Oh my God, I got your message. What's going on? We got into an accident, a really bad accident. Um, Scott... Sco... Scotty's dead. Wait, did you say he's dead? Oh, my God, like, dead? Oh, my God! I couldn't call earlier 'cause I was at the stylist and then I went shopping 'cause they had this sale on... No, his phone is dead. His cell phone is dead. That's what I meant, that his cell phone's dead. He's fine. Uh, he's okay? He's... Scotty's fine. Oh, good, 'cause I'm having such a bad day. Look, my phone is gonna die, okay? So, I... I need you to call the cops. Where are you? I... I don't... I don't know where I am, but... but if you have them call me maybe they can trace the call or something? Okay, I'm calling right now. Donna, thank you so much. You're a life saver. Bye. You still on the line? You didn't say anything, right? No, we had a whole conversation in mime. You think this is funny? You may not realize it, but you need my help. Yeah, you've been saying that this whole time. That's because you don't underst... Is that your call waiting again? Yup. And this time it's the cops, the actual help. And after they're done with me they're gonna come and find you and lock you up, murderer. Nicole, you need me! Casey, go fuck yourself! Hello? Is this Mrs. Nicole Diamond? Yes. This is Officer Gurney. I understand you were in some kind of crash. Yes, officer, please, I need your help. Well, don't worry ma'am, help is on the way. I just need to ask you a few questions. Okay, but please hurry because my phone battery is gonna die. We're tracking the call. Once the location is acquired, we'll route a local patrol to you. Now, ma'am, can you tell me the number of people in the vehicle? Two. Me and Scotty. But, Scotty's... Dead. I... I... I'm... I'm sorry, did you say someone's dead? Yeah, my boyfriend. How long has your ex-boyfriend been dead, ma'am? My... boyfriend, not my ex-boyfriend. I'm... I'm not sure how long it's been. Ma'am, I need to be specific in the report. If he's dead, he's your ex-boyfriend. Now, what exactly caused the crash? Uh... I'm not sure. I can't really remember. I, uh... someone hit me. Okay, ma'am. Thank you. One final question. Okay. It's a multi-part question. Just bear with me, okay? Okay. The question is, what on earth did you see in Scott, and why can't you see that Casey's trying to help you? Excuse me? Who is this? Hiya, Nicole! It's me... On my cell phone. The cops are calling me any minute, okay, so... Bullshit. You forgot, my landline's still connected. So I basically have a monopoly on your phone. You thought you were stuck with me before? Holy shit are you stuck with me now! We'll see about that, jerk-off! Hello? Hola! Adios! Hello? That was rather rude. You wanna see rude? I'll show you rude. I'll... Hang on, they're calling... You know what? Don't hang on. Hello? Still me. Hello? Do you wanna speak with me, or with me? I mean, I could just conference us, if you prefer. I just got the most fucking awesome package with this phone. I mean, I can call up to three people at once. You wanna join my family plan? It's perfect for you with it's long-term contract and occasional beatings. Well, think about it. Listen, I got great news. I'm mobile! And I'm headed in your direction! What... How do you know... How do you know where I am? I've known all along, and I'm pretty damn close. We're finally gonna meet. Excited Nicole? What kind of reaction is that? Aren't you thrilled? C'mon, it's our first date! And look, no offense, but... I'll do the driving. That's it! That's the excitement I'm looking for. Come on! A couple of hours ago you were begging to get together. What the hell was that? They're here! I see lights! From who? The cops! The cops are here! Help! Help, I'm over here, please! It's pointless, Nicole. Shut up, Casey! They're going the opposite way. What? How do you know that? Your tire's been burning a long time. Rubber does that. It burns slowly, like a bad romance. This wind ain't gonna help at all. Nice car, by the way. At least, it was. Casey, please! You have to help me! You promised! I said, the last one was a multi-part question. The final question is, how will it end? I don't... I don't understand. What do you mean, "how will it end?" It... It already ended! Scotty's dead! Nothing's ended, and from the looks of it out here, you better answer quick, 'cause the wind's picking up and those flames are getting higher. But I don't understand. It's ending one way or another. I don't wanna die. So, how's it gonna end? I'm gonna die? You're gonna let me die? That's how it'll end? It'll... It'll end when I stop picking guys who beat women. Bingo! And how will that happen? I don't know. I guess if I use better judgment. Better judgment, meaning...? Meaning... Meaning, not dating guys like Scotty. Help! Please, please! The more you beat around the bush, the more the leaves will burn. You're... You're the one throwing the leaves in the car? You're sick! You're twisted! Please, it's getting dangerous! No. This is dangerous. You're fucking crazy! Answer the damn question, Nicole! You sick fuck! Answer the question! I don't... I have to remember... I have to look for the warning signs, and the warning signs are... Drop the textbook. You know the warning signs. You let it start! How do you make it stop? It already stopped. Scotty's dead! If you kill a cockroach in your house, is the problem solved? No. Why not? Be... Because more will come. So how does it end? Please, Casey. You have to help! Casey, Scotty's on fire! Please! Casey, please, I'm begging you, I'm burning! The greatest lessons often leave scars. Ah! It's ending, one way or another. Ahh! Motherfucker! Finally, she runs from danger! Run! Run away, little girl! Run, run, run! Oh, I knew you could learn. It's about fucking time. Stop running and face the truth. What do you want from me? - It's not what I want. - It's what you want. Was it his looks? To impress your friends? I thought he'd be good for me! Please. Help! Somebody help me! Only you can help yourself. Answer the damn question, Nicole. Why did you choose Scott? It was a mistake! Why did you choose Scott? I don't want to die! Please! Why did you choose... Because, I don't deserve any better! You do deserve better. ♪ You make me wanna... ♪ ♪ scream!
