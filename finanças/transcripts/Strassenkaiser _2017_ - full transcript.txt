You can't take him away from me. He is like a son to me. You loose a pawn - and want to take my rook? Where is the fairness in that? You do know that they're talking about you, don't you? Things will be what they are when the ignorant meet the wise... Do people usually get the stuff you talk about? Of course I couldn't say for certain, but I'm fairly sure it rained the day Samuel was born. He grew up in the projects. Let's just say his parents were often busy so he had to decide early whether he wanted to stick with the Nazi or the gangster crowd. Hassan took care of that decision for him And so Samuel became the designated errant boy for the biggest pharmacy on the block. Hassan took care of that decision for him And so Samuel became the designated errant boy for the biggest pharmacy on the block. He learned to move and to sell. Always with his backpack. Always alone. Sure, Berlin was not Miami and Hassan was no Pablo Escobar, but let me put it this way: people play ball in the minor leagues, too. He also learned about money. For such a little guy he sure earned a lot. I mean, how much were ten bucks worth back then, anyway? Samuel learned to walk like a gangster and to run like one. It was during the carnival in Berlin that he learned he had become a father. Out of the blue. Just as he realized that he had lost his backpack. For the very first time. But let's start at the beginning, shall we? When Noah had gotten onto the train this morning he had two perfectly good reasons. For one, he wanted to see his father. Usually, that might be nothing unusual. But in Noah's case it was, as they never really knew each other. But in Noah's case it was, as they never really knew each other. They were just too different. As they never really knew each other. They were just too different. Noah's world consisted of toys and kiddy coke. And his dad's... Noah's world consisted of toys and kiddy coke. And his dad's... Well, not to sound judging, but Noah's dad was a drug-dealing goon. And his dad's... Well, not to sound judging, but Noah's dad was a drug-dealing goon. On Noah's first day of school his dad went behind bars. Together with his mom, Noah moved to the countryside. His dad would send gifts now and then. First from prison, later from Berlin. They weren't allowed to see each other. Mommy didn't want that. Several birthdays and countless banged up knees later he was finally on his way to see him. Several birthdays and countless banged up knees later he was finally on his way to see him. Ah, and the second reason for his trip was a girl he knew from the web. What are you doing here? I didn't expect you at all. What are you doing here? I didn't expect you at all. How do we... Your pops shouldn't smell of beer, right? Not that I had any... Just stay here and I... I'll freshen up. All right? Okay. Take care of my boy. All right. I'll be right back.. Hey, don't you have a home? Beer? I have to go somewhere, okay? Should I call his mom? No, right? No! No. No! No. No. No. No. Exactly like that. Do you understand me? Exactly. Where's my son? Exactly like that. Do you understand me? Exactly. Where's my son? - Man, you were supposed to watch him. - But... Are you saying that you've lost my son? You blockhead were supposed to watch him. Yallah, come! Yallah! Habibi, chill. I'm dying here. Just calm down for a second. I swear, we'll find him. But we need a plan, man. If you were your son, where would you go? How should I know!? Habibi, does he have a phone? To be honest: I don't know. Habibi, does he have a phone? To be honest: I don't know. I hope he doesn't think I wanted to get rid of him, that I've let him down. I hope he doesn't think I wanted to get rid of him, that I've let him down. Let's split up! Always the best! Well, in my opinion their plan didn't seem entirely thought through. But they must have had their reasons. Anyway. We'll look here in the area and you... everywhere else. Okay. Why not. Good luck! Inshallah, we'll find him. Habibi... was that his son just now? Seriously!? You must be Noah, right? I am Lea's brother. Robert. Robert! She asked me to... asked... she... She asked me to pick you up. She should be on her way already she didn't want you to wait alone... that's why... maybe we can meet up another time.. But... she would be really sad... Hey! You all right? Come here! You should be careful who you hang out with. Take a look at this creep Go home, kid. You know Your backpack! You goddamn angel! Your backpack! You goddamn angel! Are you kidding me? Heaven sent you, man... What's your name? Noah. I'm Samuel. Noah. I'm Samuel. Sorry that I left you there like that, had a lot on my mind. Hey, are you hungry? Up for some kofta? My treat. What's kofta? You don't know kofta? What's kofta? You don't know kofta? You're not from around, are you? It's like kebab, just better. Come. Cheers mate. You'll take care of my backpack and I'll take care of the kofta. All right? You'll take care of my backpack and I'll take care of the kofta. All right? I just got a call. All right? I just got a call. I think I've just become a father. What do you say to that? Do you do that often, meet older men? Just kidding. Yes. But don't get your hopes up. You're too young for me. Mumbling Hey! Sam... what's up mate? Hold on. Hey! Sam... what's up mate? Hold on. Are you on your lunch break? - Enjoy the sun mate. - Cheers. Thanks. I mean, there is her friend calling me to tell me that I became a father. That's a wierd situation I am in. What am I supposed to say? I mean, anyone could have... That's a wierd situation I am in. What am I supposed to say? I mean, anyone could have... you know!? What am I supposed to say? I mean, anyone could have... you know!? Then he just started to make that twitching, those strange movements. And bam. Falls over. Why? Drugs, kiddo, drugs. I hardly know anyone who doesn't take anything. No matter if they're rich or poor. They're all lost. You see that? Yes? Doesn't matter. Fuck it. It's carnival. Let's enjoy ourselves. - Have you ever been to a concert? - No. No? Than it's about time. Just have to shake a couple of hands real quick. While Samuel and Noah were roaming the carnival she was sitting in some dark office in Berlin, eager, dynamic and perfectly styled. A young reporter. Investigating. Amelie was looking for a story. "Something with drugs!" her editor had demanded. There had to be some story to be found in Berlin, right? She tried to interview a dealer in his natural habitat: Stalking the prey, observing it carefully... and then the deadly strike. Thirty-five... I only have fifty. Okay. Better you get the blow here. Not from faggot Slimy over there. Some guy recommended you. Johnson told me. Better you get the blow here. Not from faggot Slimy over there. Some guy recommended you. Johnson told me. Who? Hey, did you just spit there? You can't just spit on my spot! That's disrespectful. All right, all right. I can spit here. You don't. Understood? Can you give it to me? It's fifty now. That's not fair. Fuck off, man! Asshole. Fine with that. EY STOP! COME OVER HERE YOU RETARD! Okay, do you know another one? This is super annoying! Wait a second, I need to get something. Why do I have to carry the backpack anyway? Relax. You're getting a free sightseeing-tour, you can at least carry my backpack for while. Right? You're getting a free sightseeing-tour, you can at least carry my backpack for while. Right? Buh! Noah - Marla. Marla - Noah. You're so cute! Oh my god, where did you find him? He found me. Aww, I want one. He only likes older men. How about it, Noah, do you want to dance? It frees the soul. You know what I mean? Need a rubber? Where did you guys meet? I told you before. You have such a great energy together. Come. And how do you suppose I do that? Look. This is your son. That is the carnival. Now go, look for him. Lamine? Hey. He'll find his way back to you. You may think that this is your only chance, but you'll be together. I promise. Maybe not today and probably not tomorrow. But be patient. Wait. I've been waiting for ten years. Is he high? You better clean, girl. How on earth are we going to find him? Wallah, I know where. - No, no, honey. - Just a little bit. No, honey, I don't want to. You know I don't like that kind of thing. Please. - You can be a real stiff. - Yes, but you love me for it. Yes. Right. Cheers. Lamine. Ah, you're in Berlin? Well, apparantly. Uhm, where is Noah? He's at a friends place in Potsdam. - Potsdam? - That's none of your business. Yes, in Potsdam. What do you want? What? Noah has been asking about you lately. - Did you contact him? - No. Hey! Honestly. Really! Lamine, you want the lawyers to settle this again? Lamine, you want the lawyers to settle this again? You keep one at hand anyway. Hi. I am Bent. I know exactly who you are. Good. Listen. If I find out that you have contacted him Good. Listen. If I find out that you have contacted him then I'll make your life - could you, Listen. If I find out that you have contacted him then I'll make your life - could you, thanks. I'll make your life living hell, is that clear? Man, I just... I don't want to hear it, Lamine. Just because you serve dealers coffee now instead, You think that I'd just forgive you? What's wrong with you? Don't you think that's a little harsh? Harsh? Excuse me? You tore our lives apart when you knocked out that guy's teeth. That was harsh. Ten years I kept quiet about how you earned your money, Lamine, but if you like I can give the DA's office a call and tell them a little story. Yeah? Ten years I kept quiet about how you earned your money, Lamine, but if you like I can give the DA's office a call and tell them a little story. Yeah? Anja... Grow the fuck up. And tell you what: you won't see your son until he's grown up. Then he can make up his own mind And tell you what: you won't see your son until he's grown up. Then he can make up his own mind Alright?! Just look at you! And you want to be a role model? Just look at you! And you want to be a role model? Lamine. You're such a loser! And you want to be a role model? Lamine. You're such a loser! What? We'll have a great time, you and I. Fuck! When I'm old enough I'm going to marry Marla. Well then, you're lucky I'm not into her. You little - Hey. Hey. How are you doing? Good. You? What are you up to? Carnival. You? Once my grandfather told me a story about a salesman whose deepest wish was to be everywhere at once - Once my grandfather told me a story about a salesman who wanted to be everywhere at once Once my grandfather told me a story about a salesman who wanted to be everywhere at once to control everyone and everything. He wanted it so badly that he shattered into a thousand pieces and spread all over the kingdom. At first, he was pleased but he noticed that his influence began to depreciate because each piece merely had the 1000th part of his greatness, one 1000th of his mind and one 1000th of his eloquence. As you can see, I have nothing with me. Not even a thousandth part. You want to be a one-man army but you cannot manage everything yourself. Maybe you could help me. My uncle wants to see you dead and you don't seem to have anyone to cover your back. Burak, let's talk. Come on guys, we got to get going. Hi there. Burak. I'm going to kill you now. Please let's talk. Please. The only reason people don't act even more stupid is their lack of time. Take care. Burak. Burak. Burak, please! No! Get out of here, boy! Is he yours? I don't know the boy, let him go. I don't know the boy, let him go. What's your name? Do you talk? Noah. Do you want a candy? It's a special one. Go on. Keep it! Burak. If I ever see you around again, this one is going to take care of the boy. Burak, believe me. Get your hands off. Let's go. Choose carefully who you hang out with. What are you looking at? Move. Okay. How to go about this? Assume you are a small business owner and you are doing really well. Your product is great and you are doing really well. Your product is great and your employees are motivated. Somebody is bound to notice you at some point. Not those guys... Someone who is running things on a whole different scale. Somebody much more powerful than you are. Someone who is running things on a whole different scale. Somebody much more powerful than you are.

No. Because he can. And Samuel's boss was just about to miss that point. What's up man? Listen, chief. I'm not your chief. I know you're mad at me. But no one forced you to hang out with me, right? Okay okay. I'm sorry. What you saw back there were bad people. It's the world I'm living in. But that's not me. They're out to get me. Not you. No one will harm you, understand?

Running away is no option. Boys, can I get the ball? Still want to go to that concert? Of course I do. -Cool. Still want to go to that concert? - Of course I do. - Cool. Damn it. Hold that. Granted, it's not much, but when I think about Hassan Granted, it's not much, but when I think about Hassan I can only seem to think of two things. But when I think about Hassan I can only seem to think of two things. First, the way he would always heave himself out of the car. In-cre-di-bly slow-ly. First, the way he would always heave himself out of the car. In-cre-di-bly slow-ly. Secondly... no, let's leave it at that, In-cre-di-bly slow-ly. Secondly... no, let's leave it at that, I will tell you later. Secondly... no, let's leave it at that, I will tell you later. Hey, what an honour! Just took a little break. Shut up, okay? Break?

Didn't you learn anything in all those years? This family is like a huge corporation. They want us out of the picture. That's why we should lay low for a while. I was lucky, they almost got me.

That's beyond me, really that's the shit. Well of course I didn't ask for a fucking coffee. Anyway, whose turn is it? Kim. Hello. Well of course I didn't ask for a fucking coffee. Anyway, whose turn is it? Kim. Hello. I recently went on a trip to the lake with Frank. We just wanted to go for a walk. And suddenly we heard this noise, something like: And after a couple of minutes we saw this huge bird rising from the undergrowth. And Frank was like: Oh look, a heron! A heron. - Who's Frank? - Yeah, who's Frank, man? - Frank is a saint! Who's Frank? - Yeah, who's Frank, man? Frank is a saint! Uhm okay… So I suddenly realized that herons sound like someone is vomiting although they look fucking majestic. Dude… Guys. All right? Everything's right. The question is: Are you all right? Give me the fucking cigarette. No smoking area. New owner, new rules. Show some respect. Clear? In two minutes, you're on stage. You'll come back now and fix up the tower… New owner, zazaza? Let's go. New owner, zazaza? Let's go. Who came for Sadi Gent tonight? Sadi GENT! Sadi GENT! I can tell you're ready. And I can tell you he's ready, too. I don't want to put you on the rack any longer. I can tell you're ready. And I can tell you he's ready, too. I don't want to put you on the rack any longer. I hope you all love his debut album “Bis Dato”? I don't want to put you on the rack any longer. I hope you all love his debut album “Bis Dato”? It was a little low back there. Who knows "Bis Dato"? A huge applause for Sadi Gent! She had probably gotten a tip, because Amelie was looking for him. Samuel. Well, and there she was, Well, and there she was, surrounded by teenagers that were either dripping of sweat or deodorant. - Is that your beer? - What? Your beer? Amelie's life could have been so fabulous. She most likely grew up here. Or maybe here. Or here. While spending the first years of her life feeding horses and playing the piano far from the city, While spending the first years of her life feeding horses and playing the piano far from the city, already back then she developed that stubborn urge and playing the piano far from the city, already back then she developed that stubborn urge to do exactly what her parents would not want her to do. already back then she developed that stubborn urge to do exactly what her parents would not want her to do. Amelie yearned for Berlin. For a tiny revolution. She was supposed to become a doctor or at least an architect. Journalism won't pay your bills, her father had said, he probably rather sounded something like this: "Journalism won't pay" "your bills!" Journalism won't pay your bills, her father had said, he probably rather sounded something like this: "Journalism won't pay your bills!" Of course he didn't really know that. But for Amelie it never was about paying bills. Journalism to her was like walking through a forest with a magnifying glass, and she had always loved doing that. For Samuel she had picked a notably big magnifier. Still she could not see then that they were going to fall in love. In case you have some weed left for me. DO YOU THINK YOU CAN STAB ME?! WHO WON HAH?! WHO WON!?! Are you done, my friend? Sadly, yes. Are you done, my friend? Sadly, yes. I don't want to go! Sadly, yes. I don't want to go! COME! I don't want to go! COME! Strength lies in peace. - What the fuck, man? - I must be seeing things. I love coincidences.- ...no he didn't But yes, it was a giant coincidence. There was a reason why Lamine had to go to prison. But yes, it was a giant coincidence. There was a reason why Lamine had to go to prison. The gentleman he had roughed up back in the day had been one of Hassan's guys. Lamin, lamin, lamin. Good to see you. I still owe you. Yallah, enough. Fuck, that doesn't look good. Not good at all. So many people think they need money, friends, as much as possible, need to get attention and respect.

When I was young I often imagined When I was young I often imagined that he would be an Apache. I don't know why There's something I need to fix, will you come with me? We don't need it anymore. I didn't expect you to come. Thanks. Hey... May I? Okay. But... be careful. Careful. - Are you related? - We're bros. I have to go home now. Right. Goodbye woman. Bye Baby. Here. This is for you... So you won't forget me. Don't you like it? How about that? Okay. How about that? Okay. Well. Thanks for your call. And there he went. Noah rode off into the neon sunset and Samuel... Samuel did not only leave his backpack behind on some bridge, but his whole former life. He was a father now. Well, a murderer, too. He had killed somebody, messy affair. But let's not get caught up in details. Well, a murderer, too. He had killed somebody, messy affair. But let's not get caught up in details. So Samuel had become a father. What happened then I always imagine as in one of those cheesy love flicks. Like in a beer, insurance commercial. Bathed in the tender sounds of a piano. Of course Amelie and Samuel did meet again. She got her interview and he played up his past. She got her interview and he played up his past. He apparently told her a lot of bullshit, because somehow they fell in love. Finally, Amelie wrote her piece on Samuel. About his childhood, his youth, his life, and of course she wrote about Noah, too. About his childhood, his youth, his life, and of course she wrote about Noah, too. Grand Coupe. 250 kp/h. And of course she wrote about Noah, too. Grand Coupe. 250 kp/h. I see. Doesn't look to good for you. Drink up. I don't get your rules yet. Well. Let's do this. Why did you decide to get in touch with me? Your handwriting. But what do the best and worst of times have in common? Hm...? They pass. At some point you have to put that pen away and hand in that article. And at some point You will have to accept that pending invitation. Amelie! I'm still waiting for a story. Right. How is it going with our drug dealer? To quote you: True stories are the true stories. I said that? Yap. I mean. I know stuff. No problem… Yap. I mean. I know stuff. No problem… Ehm. I'll need more time, I couldn't reach him for a while. I mean. I know stuff. No problem… Ehm. I'll need more time, I couldn't reach him for a while. Not that he deserted … went over the hills… Ehm. I'll need more time, I couldn't reach him for a while. Not that he deserted … went over the hills… I don't think so. Wouldn't be the first time he disappears for a few days. Mathilda! I need vegetables over here! Amelie, I need a story. And you'll get it. Do you actually know how many people read your last article? No. But let me guess: You'll tell me right now. Do you actually know how many people read your last article? No. But let me guess: You'll tell me right now. Loads of them. No. But let me guess: You'll tell me right now. Loads of them. Can't wait to see you. No pressure. Don't worry. You'll get it in time. Can't wait to see you. No pressure. Don't worry. You'll get it in time. What's up brother? Come in. So what will we have for dinner? That's not why you're here! You've gotten me in a lot of trouble. That's not why you're here! You've gotten me in a lot of trouble. Samuel! Hello, Mrs. Dawud. Look how weird he is being. Leave him alone. He's just polite. I know. He learned that from me. Leave him alone. He's just polite. I know. He learned that from me. Are you hungry? I have Arabian pastry for you. I'd love to. You owe me. Hassan, we talked about it. You owe me. Hassan, we talked about it. I'll pay back everything. I don't want your fucking money. You're out and I respect that. You're part of the family. But you have to do me one last favor. No problem. They are still warm. Thank you. I have to show him something. Yallah, let's go. Dinner is ready. When there are losses, people start talking. Some say I got weak. When there are losses, people start talking. Some say I got weak. I can't let that happen. We have to rush things now. All thanks to you. While you enjoyed your new life I had to clean up your shit so this fucking family won't go to war. They are ready to negotiate. What's your plan? Amelie! I thought you and your story got lost. Very good. Please, sit down. Now it is all about the staging. As a representative of a company you have to display its intangible power and strength. That's why I personally like to receive my guests in a tower. My voice gets deeper. I try to sound grand. I like fearful audiences best. They are more attentive. The evolution of a city is a fascinating thing. In the end, the best adjusted will survive. You have to know its rules. And what is the most important rule in our society? Growth. And just like the city we must grow. Grow ever further. Hassan. I'm glad you could arrange it. Please, sit. I am certain that there's a benefit for both our sides since you came to your senses. I know. I know, it wasn't easy to give up your position. But you won't leave empty-handed. Melon? Nice flow. Finger-food? Healthy. Above the roofs of Berlin. I like it. Ready to get published. Beauty. One thing you've got to tell me, I mean, where did you find that story? Beauty. One thing you've got to tell me, I mean, where did you find that story? It's seems bit fictional, doesn't it?
