"... and help me, you archpriest, So I can make this "Book of Good Love", "So it could cheer bodies and be good for the souls. " (Archpriest of Hita) the good love Oh boy, I thought I couldn't make it! Well... Take this honey. I though I'd leave by my own... I thought you were scared. - I would've love to wear trousers... I had to say we had to go to the church in school. Did you ask for the trains? There are two. The first one leaves from Toledo at one o'clock... ...and the second one at quarter to seven. - Oh! We only have 10 minutes! Let's go! What did you say at home? That I'd eat at school because I had greek lessons at two... ...and later I would study at my friends place. Are you happy? No, Jose, not in the lips... They're not leaving us alone. Did you see the face of that fat woman? Like her husband never hugged her. We should've come in 2nd class. Easy girl! It's been 12 hours since I saw you. We are on our honeymoon. We have to hang a poster in that window so nobody disturbs us. Jose, maybe they come in again. - Who? - Other people. So? We call the conductor. You are a punk. And you're a punk too! - Jose... - What? Don't you notice? - What? - The train is moving. Goodbye, Madrid! 'Til midnight. You're running out of people! Look, my hostel is over there. Are you afraid? If they caught us... Now we can't get of the train until Toledo. I'll get of in the first station, and then walk and walk way back to Madrid. Look the Manzanares river. Ugh! How filthy! The water is so black! - Mari Carmen. - Tell me, Charlie. We'll have so much fun in Toledo. Is the most beautiful city in the world. It's such a pity I'm not wearing trousers. I would've love to go all dirty. I'm planning on wearing blouse and trousers for the whole summer in France. Are you listening to me? Are you listening to me? Oui, yes, I don't. Last night I received a letter from home. My father keeps pushing me to work in the bank when I finish college. Villaverde Bajo, first station. Excuse me, how far is it from here to Madrid? Well... like 4 miles. The Hill of the Angels. There was a lot of battles around here during the war. When I was little, we came here on a school trip with the nuns... ...and one of them almost die of an sunstroke. It was when I would spend sundays listening to Father Benancio Marcos... Hey you, we've been together for almost a year. You and me together for the whole day without anyone watching us. Neither the family nor the boss... Not even our friends... Nobody! Do you realize? We'll eat whatever we want, like we're married already. No Jose, Not in the lips... Why not? Just because. But why not? The more we wait to kiss each other, the more we'll wait to go further. We've been a couple for a year, you know... Yeah, I know, I'd like to but it's not ok. Well, don't be mad at me. We mustn't argue today. Come on, smile! Let me see your face! The land belongs to those who work it. Let's see when they go for that. In the north, where we're from, they get more even. All of this is a estate of 3 hours of through road. Thousands of acres! 2 or 3 villages could settle here. This was made during the Muslim conquest. Big areas were conquered. Tickets? Is there any train going back to Madrid at 7? Yes. It leaves at 6:50. We would've travelled better in 2nd class. Right, Mrs.? No, no. I'm not Mrs. Miss. Oh, sorry. In Catalonia making friends is difficult. But when you make one is forever. Your face seems familiar to me. Where do you live in Madrid? Are you going to Toledo too? - Yes. - Until recently I had to travel with my father's permission. Until 21 years old. Are you studying too right? Yes, philosophy. Oh, I studied education in Toledo. So is it the first time you go to Toledo? Yeah. They ratify the first 2 years to us, teachers, if we study pedagogy. In Madrid, the impression that girls go to college to hunt is quite extended. We must recognize that is the goal of many girls. The little you talk to one of them you realize it's their only problem. Some of them are wishing to find a boyfriend to leave their studies or to make him pay the steak. I did my public examinations, I'm independent. I got my position and with the last reward I'm getting around 3,000. I'm a nursery teacher in Pinto. Did you see El Greco's 'El Expolio'? - No. - It's in the sacristy of the Cathedral. Lavre. What? Lavre. No, don't know. Aristocratic sport of four letters. Neither. You're always smoking. Valdemoro. Excuse me. If you wouldn't smoke.. Does it bothers you? It's because you've been smoking for two hours. It's La Codorniz. La Codorniz! I always buy it when I'm traveling. Just to kill the lonesomeness of the trip. Even though this things don't affect me. You know I'm here and you don't care at all. What an uncomfortable time! How come you didn't shave yourself, you really need it. Show me your teeth. You're so ugly! Did you see the girl of our wagon? What a beauty huh? She works everything out. A real luxury. Why don't you marry her? If you hadn't showed up I would've died. And your father, what does he say? My father... says there are some entrance exams for the bank in july. I think it's for the Santander bank. Only 2 vacancies. He says that people from college have great future. How far are we from Aranjuez? Not much. 2 or 3 stations left. Excuse me miss. Boy, you never stop smoking. The more you smoke, the more nicotine you need and so on. Can you give me my coat? Are you cold? No, I want the handkerchief. Strange weather.. but the heater is working well. If you're cold we could close the window. No, don't bother. It'll be better to close it. Thank you. The Parker 51, world record! Seems that man don't want to be seated. Excuse me. Let's go outside. Come on! In spiritual exercises the priest said that kissing were not a sin. Even if it's on the lips. What's up? Nothing, it's in the coat. Aren't you hot in here? It's really dirty. Will they throw us out of here? Look how you messed up my sweater. One girl from the faculty has married in secret because her parents didn't let her do it. And now, the girl is going to blow her nose. Come on. It looks like they're a good couple. They must be really happy because each one of them is the ideal type. You're a kid. He must be really understanding with her. They're right for each other. I really like her. Don't dare to take those pills! They're counter-productive, they'll overstimulate your nerves and mess up your memory. I like it when you're like this, natural and loving. Usually you're like a hedgehog. I don't want you to have regrets. I want you to be relaxed. To kiss you is the prove to show my love for you. You... can't control yourself. I know... You're dummy. You thought I wouldn't dare. I checked your tickets before right? Jose, it's raining. The Tajo river. The key, Jose, is having a boyfriend and keeping your own personality. Now I'm more attached to you than ever. We've been separated not wanting to. The militiamen took the priest to Toledo. It's not going to be a war like that everyday. The spanish took the gold from America, an then the communists took it to Russia. Mari Carmen, look, look. Shut up. Don't dye your hair! And inject yourself with the calcium! Look, see, daughter? That's the Tajo river. We almost arrive to Toledo. Sit, tiger! Still a few minutes left. Come on, sit. Have a good trip. Thanks. Finally we're alone! Oh, please. When you do things you're not sensitive at all! What's the matter? She noticed we wanted to be alone. So what do we care? You're not delicate, even less with me. You're embarrassed because we're here alone? Please, don't be angry, come on! Whatever, it's only a few minutes left. Besides, they could've left us alone in the beginning right? What a crook I've left home with! And you don't even thank me. That's enough! I'll pinch you. Get off! And let's see if you shave as soon as we get there. Who loves you more than I do? Ugly, more than ugly! I'll bite you Jose! Get off! Land ho! Bite him! Jose! Weren't you from Valladolid? I'm here to see El Greco boy! Still studying law? Yeah, what a life! You've finished right? I'm studying economics now. I saw you with a girl in the train... Is she your girlfriend? No, no. She's a girl from Toledo. Hey, I don't have any girlfriend. Well... we could have a coffee if you want. No, man, maybe I get back in the train at one o'clock. Call me at the hostel in Madrid, you know. Bye. Hey, hold this. Do you know what my father says about going to France? - What? - That we're going to see things that we mustn't to. Do you feel sick? Not even a bit! Let me see, walk. Let me see that jacket... I have to sew it up a little bit. Let's see if you shave in the first barbershop you find. Guess who I just talked to. Jose Mar√≠a from the Opus. Has he entered in the Opus Dei? Didn't you know? A year or two ago... He's one of those who marries or not? I didn't ask. Well, he was handsome. Only the handsome ones enter there. He's studying economics, later journalism and then whatever he wants. But let's wait here for a bit because I don't want to see him again. People think badly very often. Alright, I'm getting a postcard. Ciao, ugly. Could you do me a favor? When does the train to Madrid leaves? 6:50. Can I get the ticket now? No. Only one hour before the departure. Do you know that thing about El Greco? He had astigmatism. Same thing goes for me. All I see is long faces. Where can we send this? Do you want to write something? Is for Mari Tere. We could've bought round trip tickets. It would've been cheaper. Shall we take a picture here in Toledo? Handsome, honey, pretty! You're way more handsome than all the Opus Dei together! Even with that beard. Slacker. What a day! It stopped raining. We're so lucky! Come on, run! We have to smoke. Today we'll smoke a whole pack of cigarettes. How many times have you been in Toledo? Two. Look the Alcazar, we have to go there. I hate sundays. Sundays are such a pain in the ass. Witch! I love it when you're like this. What if we miss the train? Aren't you afraid? We'll stay the night here. Sure? Or we could hitchhike! It's the Alcantara bridge, from 9th century! I read it in one of my father's books last night. Guess when I slept. At 2 am. This bridge was made by the arabs in the year eight hundred something. Kind of. It's a national monument. "The water of the Tajo river, following the path of the sun, surrounds the marvelous city in an eternal embracing of love. " Where did I read that? That thing I read last night... The Door of the Twelve Chants. Stop! Stop there! I was born in 1942! Don't you see? The station. We came from there. It's beautiful. This city is sensational. I think I'm a fool. I thought of studying history but I chose french. I wanted to study art. It was what I liked the most. In summer, I would read art books all the time. Boy, we're getting on our nerves. What can we do? This sucks. I'll end up doing those exams for the bank. At least I'll settle up with my father. I'll have to move to Valladolid. This is the worst time in my life. I'm not happy with anything. I don't know if it happens to you too, maybe it's a normal thing. Maybe is because student life is over. Give me a penny. Have I told you that when I was 15 I failed one of the bank exams? It was for a bellboy vacancy. In the text I wrote 'yesterday' with an 'H'. I wrote it so big with a gothic font! With ornaments! In the letter, my father says the company wants to retire him. At 62 years old. And they only offer him 75,000 pesetas. Hell waits us when we get back. And now what do we do? Well, let's live here in Toledo. Come on, give me your hand. Let's go. Oh, my bag! Come on, run! Come on! Here we are! I'm going to shave, wait for me at the cathedral! Don't go with other guys, you ugly! No, not from here. I'm from Valladolid. But I study in Madrid. The Pisuerga (river) city! Get the electric one, man! "The child Mari Carmen Bernaldo de Quir√≥s verified her first communion the day 11 of May of... " What is it like living here in Toledo? What? What can one do for good in this city? Apart from seeing monuments, of course. Here, that stuff, nothing. What a guy... Well... and with a girl? Nothing anyways. Should I shave it more? No, leave it like that. I'm used to the electric machine. It doesn't matter that I'm a barber. I recognize the convenience of the electric machine. It's true, it's worse for shaving but you make it faster and without danger. Well, they better watch out for that Pisuerga river. Starts growing, brings more and more water, and spoils everything. Better be careful with those rivers. Boy you scared me! You're a crook! Who's that guy? My boyfriend. He's really cute. Where are you going to work this summer? France. I'm going too but on my own, to clean up houses. The 80% of girls consider this boyfriend thing like something temporary. Before I met him, there was this other guy from the faculty who wanted to go out with me. It seemed like the perfect guy. Religious, nerd, from a good family... Well, I didn't like him. - Who's that guy? - And you know what he told me? - Her boyfriend. I had to be her girlfriend but I didn't like him. Nothing, it's the boyfriend of that girl. Look at the roof! - What's up? - Nothing. You look good shaved. Are you hungry? No. I know you, I know you very well. It seems they're not into religious stuff. I mean it's impressive. It's fine that they fall in love with that kind of girls, but not only for their bodies! Do you feel me? Not at all! (Singing a song about the cathedral) Don't go so fast! No... No. Come on, let's see who goes up first. 66, 67, 68, 69... Look, the Alcazar again. I'm a bit cold. I have a headache. Maybe I die. When will we smoke? Have any cigarretes? If I knew where my friend's convent is, I'd visit her. Jose... Cristi went through hell because her boyfriend couldn't control himself. They had to break up. The cycling stuff is because of my husband. We both depend on the cathedral. My husbands works at the entrance door. Maybe he checked out your tickets. Does the soup tastes good? Did you see the giant statues yet? If you didn't, you came here for nothing. They're famous in Toledo. It looks like your sister feels better now. Is it the first time you come here? Well then I'm going to explain things for you. From here you'll see that everything here is ancient. Century over century. As you can see, these lamps were taken out during the procession's eve in august 14. Now you'll see the eyes of this monster, let's see what do you think. I'll leave you guys alone now. I don't get anything but tips. Only my husband gets his pay. Did you like it? She only gets tips! This is the monster of Toledo. She only gets tips! Your jokes aren't funny at all Mari Carmen. What's wrong with you? Didn't you say you've been here twice? Fool. Because what you said it's silly. Well, you're not exactly the best. Did I do something wrong? You tell me and that's it. Boy, you don't get jokes. Want to me mad at me? You don't want to kiss me because you're embarrased. Why did you come to Toledo? Tell me. Come on, tell me. It was our idea to come here right? Please, answer me. Weren't we sick of being watched?! Not finding a place where we could be alone for a day at least. Without families, neighbors, nobody! Wasn't it what we wanted? Aren't we alone now? Answer me. Don't go, answer me! When did the first train leave? At one o'clock, but... Are you stupid or what? Let's go eat something. Still have that headache? Are you tired? We're hungry. That's what's up. If you want we could go to the drugstore to get an aspirine. Look! Look, look, look, look... The fork! I'll stab you! Watch out! Be quiet! Wait for the omelette. Want some wine? Bring more wine lady! Ok. No, no! No way... Come on, come on. You're the sick one so eat. The omelette is coming. Come on, eat! Jose, we're not going back home. Honeymoon trips last 20 days. And we deserve more than that. More rice? I'm fine. Tomorrow you'll cook the same meal for us. Because we're staying 20 days, 30 days, 40 days.. Our whole life! Yes, yes. The number is 2762007. Yeah, my adress is Juan Bravo 7. He's calling home. Two blocks down the road, Velazquez's corner. Yes, please, I want to call to Madrid. Number is 2535218. Will I have to wait much? Oh, I'm filling dizzy. It's alright... the wine cures everything. Mon ch√©ri! Cristi won't believe this! More than one hour? No, forget it. The coat. What's up? I'm worried about that call. - Don't worry. Coffee? Could you get us some coffee? It's going to rain. Come on Julito! Brings us some wine! Oh yes. Weren't you making that call? Well, let's not think about it too much. We'll be having fun until then. To hell with all of them! It looks like we're in Madrid... Didn't you know that I saw Jose Mar√≠a, the guy from the Opus Dei, again this morning? At the Plaza de Zocodover. He was with 3 kids. He was preaching. See, Jose Mar√≠a was a good friend. Then things happened and we separated from each other. He's a great boy. He's great. I think those exams are set to next year. I should prepare myself while I'm still at college. My father says that banks are paying six bonuses now. Studying in college just to earn 2000 pesetas per month. It's ridiculous. It's going to rain at any moment. Do you think my family will know I'm here? Because of that call? - Yes. - Don't be silly. - Julito! Come on man! Bring us some more glasses! You're falling asleep! Come on, tell me more things about your family. I'd really like to meet your mother. Look, he's soaked to the skin. Boy, what a day... You're lucky you're inside... You're right. It looks like Madrid. Come on kid, take the box! Oh, let me read the letter from Mari Carmen. If she knew what I'm doing... She'd kill me. She's so puritan. You've seen those pictures already, look... Those were the trousers I would've loved to come with. Well I'll start reading. She's in Salamanca. "As I hate going out on sundays, I spend my time reading, listening to music and writing letters... " Well, this is boring. "It's no wonder... what you say about marriage. " "And that you've been shocked. And I'm not surprised that us girls are not so clever about those things. " "And you, with all your sisters married, should be a lot more careful! Silly!" Look, that's Mari Tere, the one with the white dress. "If you want to gain some weight, you should only eat snacks. " I wrote her that I was getting skinny and you forced me to eat. "I think the novel you were saying was called 'Grand Hotel', not 'Shanghai Hotel'. Both by Vicki Baum. "But I think the first one is a lot stronger and dirtier. " Did you read it? No. I did. It was a special time for me when I read it. Listen to this: Look, one of Mari Tere's sisters is studying medicine. And of them, check this out Jose, has two pictures. In the first one, there's one guy with full beard and grown moustache,short hair and wearing a suit! Etc, etc. And in the second picture, after some kind of surgery... ...the same person appears as a cute girl, with blue eyes and all. I'll have to study this case. Oh man, I'm falling asleep... Hey you! Watch it! Those things are women stuff! There are things you can't see. Come on, honey, seat well, come on... Oh, look, the address of the hostel in France. Men aren't aware of anything at all. Women have more sensitivity than you, but you don't appreciate it. Look, the keys. I think we shouldn't have come here. Do I have bags under the eyes? It's because of the anaemia. I'd like to find out where is the convent of my friend. She would feed us with loads of sweets. Candied pears, spaghetti squash jam, Toledo's marzipan... Mari Carmen, do you hear it? It's your stomach. It's because of the wine. No. It's that quince jelly. It's the wine! - The quince jelly. I drank half a bottle! You... I've washed my hair this morning but now I can't. How do you feel now? I feel better. But how much did you sleep? Oh, men are so rude. You know nothing about women... I think it's the Clarisas... my friend's convent... Let's see if you can find El Greco himself in the painting. He's one of those gentlemen down there. It's called flamboyant because of the flames' effect. He's the one in the sixth place from left to right. One, two, three, four, five, six... It's the husband of the lady who showed us that monster! I don't know if I have astigmatism or myopia... but I see everything like El Greco did. Dom√©nikos Theotok√≥poulos. I see everything foggy, surrounded by dark... I can't see you. Where are you? Are you with me or... with other girl? I don't know why I love you, you tell me. Why do I like you? Why do I love you? Why do I like you? At first, I thought all the handsome boys were stupid. I think I love you because you're a show-off. Yes, and pretentious. You don't let people talk. And everything about you is the best. Did you bring the missal? Come on, kiss me... I love it. You're right. Sundays suck. I prefer weekdays too. I would spend my whole life like this... Is this tape recorded? - Yes, it's recording tape. Have you visited El Greco's room? Here, "La Ver√≥nica". "... the discoverer of America, the one who gave a whole new world to his homeland. " Hey! This is the 'Appearance of Christ to Virgin Mary'. Look, sir. The line of the hands. Stop. Stop. Oh, Motherland! Ok, ok, thank you. You're welcome. You can go on with the same ticket. Well, thanks. Did you see the 'Venus at her mirror' at the Velazquez's centenary? "... with sixteen years old, she filled her jewish home with joy and happiness. But one day, the heart of this gentile jewish girl throbbed with unknown violence, with stronger and unequal rhythm. Like a bird leaving his nest. She felt a new sweet emotion. It was the triumphal arrival of love. Love for a christian gentleman full of valor and youth. " Come on girl, it was only a joke. I swear I didn't do it to offend you. Did it hurt? I'm sorry, Mari Carmen! We were so happy right before... I've lost it. Seems like we can't be fifteen minutes without arguing. If it's not my fault then it's yours. Come on, don't act that way! I think it wasn't that bad... You can't be mad for nothing. One must shut up because otherwise you'll get upset. Forgive me! I won't do it again! It wasn't on purpose. My hand slipped! What do you want me to do, tell me! Tell me! Look, Mari Carmen, nobody saw us. If you want to be upset then do what you want. But this... is nonsense! - Leave me alone! - Besides, it bothers me! So if everything upsets you, you tell me. You're being so childish. A silly child! Seriously, won't you talk to me? Don't want to talk to me? Are you stupid or what?! What do you want to get out of this? Tell me, please! Is this going to be like this for the whole day? It's been four times that we argue. Should we go on for ten times? Is that what you want? Please... Answer me if you like. If you want! If you feel like it! Don't you want to talk to me? Don't you? I'll wait for you at the station at 7. If you want to come, come. If not, stay here alone! Come on girl, screw you! Hey, you fuckhead! And what is this? Cross sewing. And this? It's embroidery. Then the thread is removed and it leaves a nice print. Girls! You girls are gonna be sightless. How many tickets? - Just one 3 pesetas. And you did everything all by yourself? - Yes. This girl is laughing too much! Damn Juani! You keep going like this until tomorrow! Don't you have any change? - No Then wait. So you're the artists. Come on, come on, stop, you're gonna break yourself! And how do you solve this crossword? Juani, you're dummy! - My gosh, girl, you're worth a million! When do the movies open? That depends on what movie you want to see! Some of them starts at 5. - Yikes Juani, what did you eat today? Just one. 2 pesetas. - Ciao beauties! I would marry the three of you all together! Hey, sir! There's one theater opening at 4. Maybe it's open already. - Thank you. It's a continuous projection cinema. It's really close! Go ask near the plaza next to the cathedral. You'll find it! - Thanks pretty! Ciao Deanna Durbin! So this was a withdrawal place for women... Who wants to come with me to the movies? There you go Juani. Weren't you saying how cute he was? Then go with him. Who's not afraid of coming with me? Juani are you coming? Are you? Can I get some water? - Yes, come closer. He's really nice... Come on. Come on! Don't you worry, I'll bring her back in one piece. Ciao, it'll be your turn tomorrow! Paul Newman! - And what about actresses? Oh, it's not the same... maybe Conchita Velasco. Are you from Madrid? - Cold, very cold. But you're spanish! - I study in Madrid. I usually travel to Madrid for Christmas. I stay over at my aunt's place. She's from Embajadores. Give me one. Do you want to seat in the front? - No, no, it's fine here. Thanks. No, no, no. Nothing happens until later. Do you know when are the trains leaving? - To Madrid? Oh, I don't know... Will you be mad if we leave now? - Now? Stay here if you want. - No, no. Come on, stay if you want. - No, forget it. I'm going with you. Won't you be upset? You can stay but... - No, no! I'm going to the station... I'm going with you. I don't have anything else to do. Still, you can stay. - No, I'll go with you. Don't worry about me. Seriously you're not upset? - Don't worry, I'll go watch it some other time. So your aunt is the sister of your father? - Yes. She lives right next to the subway station. Are you going to Madrid this Christmas? - Yes. My aunt is sick so I go there to help her. Excuse me, what's your name? - Jose. Do you want some milk? Do you want some Juani? - Yes ma'am. - That's what happens when you eat shortbreads. You feel thirsty. I'm eating these shortbreads like everyday. Do you want milk? - Yes. Do you like them? Want some more? - Another half a dozen? Yes. - She's hungry, that's good. Do you make them yourself? - No, no, The baker makes them. They're easter cupcakes. They have butter, eggs and flour. I thought they had more ingredients. - Of course you have to know the secret. That's the key. - I prefer these rather than today's marzipan. Today's marzipan sucks. Of course, you're right. Can I pay you now ma'am? - Yes, sir. No problem. Total: a dozen plus the milk, 26,50. Yes, these. - They're called Damasquinos. Look how funny are these Toledans couple. And this garterana? How much is it? -250 pesetas. Thank you. - You're welcome. Don't worry, I'll put it in it's place. Hello ugly! Easy tiger! Don't scratch me! I said hello. Is everything ok now? Easy! There's the guard and you're underage. Civil code 211. article: The responsability of those who are under the legal age applies to... First. The grandfathers. Second. The grandmothers. Third. The oldest brother. And here I am each one of them for you right now. You're not funny at all. - Man, the mute finally talks! This is a miracle! Look Jose, you're such a fresh. Besides, I don't need you to walk around Toledo. There she goes again! Women are the only pure and delicate saints. Last sunday we spent the whole evening in the subway because it was cold outside. Because we were sick of going to the movies and coffees! And now that we're alone you do this to me. - Look Jose, I told you this in the train. The more you wait to do certain things the more it takes for bad things to happen. But... just one spank, what a sin! But do you think you're gonna do whatever you want? I shouldn't have let you kiss me. You're such a fresh! And I'm a fool... Mari Carmen, do you seriously mean than? That I shouldn't have kissed you. But who do you think yo are? Huh? That I'm not allowed to touch you? That you're made of wax? You're afraid of everything but you know who I am. How did your family educate you? Huh? What do they say to you? Tell me, answer me, please. I'm your boyfriend. You know what that means? But what does your family want? Does their daughter have a boyfriend or not? Who am I supposed to marry... you or your family? Why are you studying, tell me. Going to France... But every summer you end up nowhere but home! "My aunt says this... my mother says that... " France is not dangerous at all! They think you're coming back home with a baby. What would happen to you if there wasn't any boyfriend around...? Forgive me. I don't know what I'm saying anymore... Forgive me. It's true.. We've been like this the whole year. Then you marry and you don't know anything at all. And I know I'm making you suffer... I'm sorry anyways. I love you. I really love you Mari Carmen. I would like to marry you. At first, I'll earn little money but if you want to help me.. I'll keep studying. You'll meet my mother. It isn't espectacular but both mom and dad have worked a lot. And going to the movies on a date depresses me... They always make you seat at the last rows, where there are many other couples... ...and if you don't leave a tip they get upset. And if you go to have a coffee, you'll have to put something to cover up your legs. Jose, we should get married. And I could teach some lessons or go to work... Well... It wasn't such a bad day. I'll remember it. Hey Jose. - What? Can we go nearer Toledo again? Will we have time? Let's go. I love you a lot more... When we get back to Madrid you better take me home. I think I'll walk up the stairs trembling. How do you feel now? Tired? - I'm feeling better. That spank woke me up! Hey, it's too late. We don't have time to see anything. What should we do? - We'll come back other day. We have barely have 30 minutes left. Why don't we stay 5 minutes more? And that guard is always over there. I have the water up to my neck. You better pray for me. I'm in real trouble and I won't even sleep. My mind has gone blank. Do you know how to make pumpkin pie? Of course, they don't prepare us for college in school. - If I tell you something, will you get mad? - Tell me. Sure? - We argued enough for today. You're gonna kill me you savage! Was that what you wanted to tell me? Yeah. - Come on, girl. Let's go take that train. - No. Otherwise we'll have to run. - Just one more minute please. Oh! We didn't get to see the Alcazar. I can't remember everything. I can only remember the war, the ration books and the contraband in the Tajo river. Even though Valladolid is famous for it's black market. I'd love to read a good book about the Spanish War. I'm a bit confused. Hey you! We don't have much time! No way! Mari Carmen! Come back! I got you! I got in first! I'm getting one postcard. Did you save the museum tickets? - Yes. Collecting this silly stuff... Come on darling, hold this, it's your turn. You must be really tired huh? Come on! We'll miss the train! - Don't you know how to write? Write an X. Two 3rd class tickets to Madrid. And where do I send the postcard? Will we have enough time when we arrive? It would be really funny if we miss the train now. Give me one penny. - Here. Isn't there any 2nd class tickets? - Off you go! But what about the postcard? - Fly! THE END
