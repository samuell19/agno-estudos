Don't you worry none, billy. That lightning can't get to us. You're safe in the car. Had a little engine trouble and had to set her down. I think it's probably a fuel line. You mind giving me a hand? I'll have her back up in the air in a second if you just help me out. Okay. All right. You just stay put, billy. I'll be right back. Hold this for me. No! No! Don't shoot! What do you want? I've got money. Stay back! I've got the kid! You're gonna be all right. I'm a cop. He won't be hurting anyone else. Need a hand? - hey. - well, hey, Officer. You okay? I heard something on the radio that you rescued a little boy. What happened? Some freak snatched him up. I tracked him with my plane. We got him back. Kid's gonna be fine. Well, that's great, but you don't seem all that happy. Things got a little messy out there. Looks like now I'm a free man. You got fired? Yeah. You shot him, Jim? You killed him. Look, I thought he was goin' for a gun. I wasn't stickin' around for a confirmation. Oh, Jim. Sheriff's calling it excessive force. He wanted me to see a shrink again. But I couldn't do it. I told him no. Honey, you can't just go around shootin' people 'cause they're wacko. You know? Well, we're not gonna worry about that anymore, are we? Damn it, Jim! You promised me you weren't gonna do something like this again. Maggie, I know. Well, you just have to get some help. And then they'll take you back, or you could do something else. But you've got to get yourself together. At least try. Maggie, there's nothin' I haven't already tried. I think we need to take a break. Together, I mean. We'll take some time, we'll get away for a while. It'll be good for the both of us. But if you don't do something, Jim, I don't know what's gonna happen... To us. Hello. You've reached Johnson and Ness crop-dusting. Please leave a message. No! Hello? Mrs. Esteridge. Uh, hi. This is Jim Halsey calling. Jim! How the heck are you, honey? Uh, fine. Fine, thanks. Uh, is... is the captain available? Huh! You know he is. Hold on a sec. I'll go get him. Stop your yappin', cal! Ain't nothin' ever there. Honey, phone's for you. Honey! Bonnie! It's Jim Halsey. Hello there. Jim? Uh, hey, captain Esteridge. How you doin'? Fine, fine. H-how you doin'? Shit. Captain, I'm in a world of hurt here. I screwed up big time. I need to talk to you. I mean, Officer to officer. Look, uh, to tell you the truth, I don't really know why the hell I'm calling. I don't mean to bother you, sir. Oh, hell. Look here, Jim. Sounds like this isn't something we should handle over the phone. Why don't you come on down and visit? Bonnie and I would love to see you. And bring that girl you told us about. There's no way I can come back there. Not right now. No way. Well, listen, Jim. This thing's still eatin' you alive. Sometimes the only way to get over somethin'... Is to face it straight on... dead on. I realize that, sir, but... I haven't been down there since... th-that's the point. It's about time. You have to. Well, maybe you're right, sir. Maybe coming down there will do us some good. I know I'm right, Jim. We'll do it. We'll both come down there. All right, that's my boy. Now, you be careful comin' down, 'cause there's supposed to be some kind of a storm brewin'. Don't you worry about that. We're gonna be okay. Thank you, sir. Well, it ain't Cabo, but at least it's a change of scenery, right? Yeah. Let's go. Hello? Hello? Good thing we called ahead, I guess. Beat the rush. Maybe the keys are in the car. So you met captain Esteridge passing through here? Yep. A long time ago. I had a little car trouble here. I got stranded. Captain Esteridge helped me out. What happened, Jim? Let's just say that he's the reason I became a cop. We stayed in touch ever since. Look out! My god, that guy almost killed us! This was supposed to be our "no killing" trip. You okay? Yeah. - yeah, are you? - yeah, I'm okay. For those of you just tuning in, we have a storm alert in effect. to the Culverton-Huntsmith county line. There's a heavy wind advisory from nickel creek Reports of 50- to 60-mile-an-hour winds kickin' up sand and debris. Visibility is poor, and the highway patrol advises people... To stay at home if at all possible. In other news, runaway cow injures... Oh, my god. Pull over. They've had an accident. Car's not there. They've already gone for help. Somebody could be hurt inside. Look, I'm not stopping, Maggie! Jim, why are you acting like this? I can't believe you won't pull over. You're a trained cop. You don't know what you're talking about. There was nobody there. Oh, my god. Is he crazy? Where'd he go? We have to pick him up. No. Are you crazy, Jim? He'll die out here. - no way, Maggie! - stop! no! We can't just leave some guy stranded out here in a sandstorm. we can't do it. - what are you doing? - whatever you do, do not let him in here. Maggie! Ooh. Thanks, folks. Not too many people pick up a hitchhiker these days. I've been waitin' for you. Looks like you took a pretty good spill back there. You all right? Ah, hell, I'm all right. Uh, I'm Maggie, and... and this is Jim. Jim. Isn't that something? I'm Jim too. I think there's a small town a couple miles up ahead. We'll take you that far, but that's it. Sounds good to me, Jimmy. I'm just glad to be alive. So don't tell me. I'll bet you're a farm girl, aren't ya? Well, I used to be. But the bank took the land, so I had to find something else to do. That's me! Always findin' something else to do, you know? Little bit of this. Little bit of that. If I don't keep myself busy, I'll just... I'll just go crazy. What do you do for fun? I fly planes... crop duster. Uh, Jim here is a cop. Got myself a couple of professionals! So where are we goin' to today? - we're just... - none of your business! My mistake, folks. I'm sorry. What you doin' there, Jimmy? I'm gonna get some coffee. You need somebody to fix your bike, so I'm gonna let you off here. Oh, no. No, I'm afraid that's not gonna work. Well, it's not your call, is it, pal? Well, it may not be my call... I've been waiting for you for a long, long time. No! God! - take your hand out of your jacket... - whoa! Whoa! And get out of my vehicle! - son of a bitch. - what are you doing, Jimmy? Why do you have a gun? - look, Jim... - get out of the car! Listen, Jimmy, I was just getting... get out! Get out of my car. Jim. Well, all right. Thank you for the ride. Don't take this personal, Jimmy, but if I were you, I'd get myself some serious professional help. Nice to meet you, farm girl. That guy's psycho. Jim, what is going on with you? He had a gun. He did not have a gun! Yo had a gun! Damn fool. Truck stop's closed. Why? Why did you have a gun on vacation? Maggie, he had a gun! He was gonna kill you, and then he was gonna kill me! Did you see a gun, Jim? I didn't have to! You're really starting to scare me, Jim. Y-y-you're acting crazy. Look, you're just gonna have to trust me on this one! He definitely had a gun. Damn. What are you doing, Jim? Pull over. Pull over. License and registration. Yeah. So, speed racer, where you goin' in such a hurry? Ah. You know, we're just passin' through here, sir. Kinda got away from me. Hmm. Get out of the car! Slowly, with your hands up! - both of you! - I can explain this. Shut up! Shut up! Now step back, put your hands on the hood of the car. Now! - I'm a police officer. - police officer, yeah. Iowa. Where the heck is that supposed to be? Not around here. Cop, huh? I used to be. Then you should know better... Than to carry a concealed weapon, shouldn't ya? Both of you just stay right there where you are... While I call this in. Billy? Is that you? Something going on here. I'm gonna need you to step back just for a sec, all right? - what's that? Huh? - aw, shit. Patty, I'm gonna need some backup here. Pronto, would ya? Damn it, billy. I said stay back! - Oh, my god. - I said stay back! I'm dealin' with a law enforcement situation here. - well, hell, so am I! - Maggie, go. Go! Freeze! How you folks been? go, go, go, go! - oh, shit. - no! No! Hi there. adios, farm girl. God, Jimmy, I'm so sorry I ever doubted you! We gotta get to captain Esteridge. He's the only one that can help us. Oh, my god. I just can't believe any of this is even happening! - it's starting again. - what? What's starting? About 15 years ago, when I was a kid, I was driving across country for the first time. I had to deliver a rental car to San Diego, when I drove right through here and I picked up a hitchhiker. Son of a bitch was psycho. He started killing people. Killing cops. - Innocent families. - pull over! That guy will kill you! He killed this girl that I knew. He set me up for it. He framed me for the killings. Everybody thought it was me. Except for captain Esteridge. He was the only one that believed me. He helped me out. They finally caught the son of a bitch. We escaped. And I had to kill him. I shot him dead. My god. So what you're saying is that you think this is the same guy? No. He doesn't look the same, but it's him. I know it's him. We have to get to the cops and tell them everything. They won't believe us. We gotta find Esteridge. He's the only one I trust. Where the hell's that map? Why don't I get that? Sheriff's office. Deputy Lyle speaking. Yeah, I was just down at the gas and brew there, and I heard these two kids talkin'. Scared the bejesus outta me. Said they're goin' go after some guy named Esteridge... And kill him slow for what he done to 'em. Who in the hell is this? She had a gun. I saw her. A big one. I tell you, you'd better get out there. Who knows what's gonna happen? Jesup, are you out there? Jes? Jes, I got somethin' for ya. It could be somethin'. That's weird. Come on. Captain Esteridge? Cap? Stay here. No way. Cap? Wait. Jim. We've gotta get out of here. Uh-uh. We'll just call for help. He did this. Come on. Jim, come on. Mrs. Esteridge is dead! She's dead! Whoever's in there, come out now... With your hands up! We'll explain everything. What? That we killed everybody? It's not gonna work, Maggie. I've been through that before. We gotta find this son of a bitch and we gotta stop him ourselves. I'll do it. They'll believe us. - Okay? - Come out now! We're comin' out! We'll explain everything. Just don't shoot. Come on, Jim. Two's company. Three's a crowd. Sorry, crop duster. - Maggie! - Jim! Now why did you have to go and do a thing like that, Jimmy? Who am I gonna play with now, I wonder? What the... Jim. Jesus. God! Hold your fire. Captain Esteridge? Captain, you in there? Aaah! Christ! Two officers down. We're at Esteridge's farm. Send backup now. All hell's broken loose out here. You got it, sheriff. I'll send someone out right away. Jesus! Patty, we got two suspects, one male, one female, fleeing in a black-and-white prospector, headin' west on the old highway. Hang on, Jim. Hang on. Maggie, you have to kill him. Promise me you'll kill him, no matter what. Baby, you just hang on. I'm so... I'm so sorry, Maggie. I'm so sorry. Please, god. Please, god. Please. Please. Jim! You've gotta make it, Jim. I love you. I love you. I'm so sorry. No! No! No! Jim? Morning, sunshine. You freak. Why are you doing this? Why the heck not? you'll never get away with it. Oh, no? What are you gonna do about it? You gonna hurt me from down there? You just give me the chance! Nope. I don't think you got it in ya. Not yet. Yeah? Just try me, you bastard! Adios, Maggie. Oh, hey, uh, by the way, this structure here looks like it's 'bout ready to go. I wouldn't make any sudden moves if I were you. Are you still there, you son of a bitch? Is anybody here? Can anybody help? Shit. Aaah! No! Ugh! ♪ What kinds of weapons do you have? Forget it. Ahh. I need a phone. And the ladies' room? Fred? You've reached Johnson and Ness crop-dusting.

Oh, he's out back. He's coolin' off. - why don't you take a seat anywhere you like? - get out of here, now. Go! Damn, woman. Do you know how hard it is to build a customer base in this kind of a town? Turn around. Can I at least get me some pie... Before you go choppin' me up in front of that sheriff friend of yours? Who I suspect will be here momentarily. no, no! Who do you think they're gonna believe... Farm girl? What are you? Watch now. Oh! Sheriff, look what she done to me. And I use that finger too. Bam! Kickin' it up a notch. See, I just called the sheriff myself... couple minutes ago. Yeah, problem with the counterman. Seems some crazy farm girl... Came in and messed him up real good. Ma'am, if you're in there, and I imagine you are, I need you to come on out now. I know we had an understanding, but since then, we got a report of trouble out here, so I gotta treat it that way. You ask me, he sounds like a reasonable fella. Come out and everything'll be okay. We know about the trouble with your boyfriend, Jim. Yeah, sounds like he's tryin' to work with you there. You are not getting away again, you sorry son of a bitch! Maggie, I don't keep bullets in that particular gun. Safety thing and all, you know. I do, however, keep this one down here... Fully loaded and prepared at all times. No! Damn it! Catch. - Lyle, get around back. - got it. You freeze now! The woman's crazy! You've gotta arrest her! Look what she did to me. Hold your fire! Freeze! That's her. That's her. She's the one right there. She's the one that did this to me! Patty, we got the suspect... drop your gun! Do it! She's psycho. I know it. I ran to get out. You arrested me. You, uh, recognize this? Yes. It's mine. He took it... Jim. Well? Hmm? Well, that man's name is jack, Maggie. Jim's your boyfriend, and he's dead. He told us his name was Jim. You don't believe any of this, do you? I don't know, Maggie. Who the hell is he? You don't know? I have no idea. Now, jack, when you went into the café, she was behind the counter? Yes, sir. Yeah, you know, I thought she worked there. You know? And then she started acting all nervous, and her eyes started kinda dartin' around. I don't know. She was acting kinda creepy, if you ask me. And you didn't see the counterman? No. No, sir. Not then. And she pulled a gun on you? Yeah. Well, yeah, and then she told me to come around behind the counter, and that's when I saw the counterman... well, the counterman's body. And then she told me to move it for her. I said, "no way. Uh-uh, ma'am. Uh-uh. I ain't moving no dead body. I mean, I ain't touching no dead body laying there, blood on the floor. You know, I can't do it. Uh-uh." A-and then she cut you? Yeah. She was holding the gun to my head, and then she pulled out a tomahawk, of all things, and chopped off my finger. And I... I mean, all I wanted was some pie. I mean, all I wanted was a piece of pie. Yeah, they're, uh... they're good pies. Now, what happened when the officers arrived? Well, um... well, they talked real nice to her, and then she just opened fire on 'em. Right through the window. Busted it too. Are you sure she fired first? Yes, sir. Most definitely. And that's when you ran. Yeah, like a redheaded stepchild. I had to get outta dodge. I mean, that's one hell of an unbalanced lady right there. I'll tell you, she cut off my finger, turned it into fry bread. And I hope she burns in hell for what she did to me and those officers. Now... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for the language. It's just the way I feel. Thank you, jack. Deputy, would you uncuff him, please? Oh. Oh... Ah, yeah. Hoo! Thank you very much. Hey, um, you think I could get me one of them bear claw things? Sure. Of course. Oh, thank you. Thank you so much. Scum. Scum in a real pretty wrapper. I don't know, lieutenant. The boyfriend might have cracked and drove her over the edge. Might have cracked? Did you read the report sent in by his sheriff boss back in Iowa? Yeah, I just... I just don't see this woman cuttin' off a guy's finger like that. - I just don't see it. - for god's sake, sheriff, add it up. She had the handgun that killed the people in that trailer. That same gun killed Mrs. Esteridge and jes. And then she shows up driving the dead trucker's 18-wheeler? The girl had gunpowder on her hands! The weapon that was used to kill Nathan... Had her prints all over it. And now Lyle here tells me she identified the necklace... That we found in Jes's cruiser. And finally, we have an eyewitness... Who she kidnapped back in the café. I mean, the poor slob's only lucky... That she didn't kill him too. Yeah. She snapped all right. Look, lieutenant, she's got no record. She's got her own crop-dusting business up in Iowa. I just... she seems real... you just think... That a woman couldn't do this. Hmm? Isn't that right? Well, that, sheriff, is prejudice right there, and, uh, it ain't fair. The state of Texas just executed a woman... Who killed two people with a pickax. And besides, no guy's gonna cut off his own finger. No way! Now, we have enough evidence... That the people here will start cheering... If we kill her our own damn selves. Yeah, I know. That's what bothers me. Where is he? The hospital, being tended to. Don't you worry, sweetie. He'll be around to testify. Don't leave him alone. He'll get away. He's the one who did all this. He is the victim, darlin'. That poor man. You see, around here, we don't like people... Who shoot cops and butcher Texas rangers. Now shut your mouth. He's gonna come back. - he's not through. - oh, but you sure the heck are. One question. Up at Esteridge's, were either of you ever up in the hay loft? No. Wait! Yeah? Do you believe me at all? Yeah, I'll be there, Maggie. Try not to worry. I'll talk to the judge. We'll have plenty of time to figure this all out. Thank you. Like hell he will. Hey, she's runnin' low, sheriff. I'm just gonna take her around back and tank her up for you. Damn it. Hurry it on up, Lyle. Aaah! Wouldn't happen to have any of them bear claw things on you, would you? Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Maggie, please drop the gun. It's him. It's him. He's here. Drop the gun, Maggie. I can get you help. That's all you need. It's all under control, sheriff. You can take a load off. No! No! Damn you to hell! That's a nice truck you got there. Yeah, I guess. I better phone the sheriff. I think you'd better. She did what? You know who I'm talkin' about? No, I know who she is. What are you gonna do about it? We will get your plane back. No. No. I'm right behind you. There you are. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Shit! Shit! That's my girl. What's goin' on, farm girl? Jim told me about that poor girl... And the way that she died. So I thought... That maybe you would like a taste of that yourself. I don't know what you're talking about. It wasn't me. Someone exactly like you, jack. Don't go talking all crazy on me now. Who the hell are you? I was just driving my gasoline truck... When you came along and... I said who the hell are you? What? And spoil all the fun? Good-bye, jack. You don't got it in you, Maggie. Not yet. no! Freeze! Well, thank god you fellas are here. She's crazy! She cut off my finger. knocked me out and tied me up. The bitch won't quit. - look at her. - no! I can't tell ya how much I respect you fellas of the law. - no, he'll kill you! - Thank you so much. Appreciate you guys helpin' me out. No! - No! - no! No! Are you still scared? What a shame. We came so close. And I thought we had an understanding. No. I'm not scared. I just don't wanna get burned again.
