[AMBIANCE MUSIC] [MANG BOY] Ma'am, ma'am, wake up. [EERIE MUSIC] [CAMERA CLICKS] [CAMERA CLICKS] [CAMERA CLICKS] Ma'am, Ma'am. Just reminding you of chief's instruction. You overreact, mister. I'm not going to post it. Promise. You're such a killjoy. Okay, I'll delete it now. Oh. There, okay now? I'm sorry, Ma'am. Just following orders. It's hard to lose a job -- Where in the world are we, mister? Still in Philippines? You can go inside now, Ma'am. Chief is already waiting. I'll go ahead. [METAL CLANKS] [METAL CLANKS] [PHONE RINGS] Hello? Where are you? Just here. Why? Why won't you tell me where you are? You're with that guy again, aren't you? Sis, if we're just going to fight, let's just end this call, okay? You're just wasting your phone credit. Hello? Hello? [CALL DROPS] [EERIE SOUNDS] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [LIGHTS TURN ON] Chief? [GASPS] Chiefy. Aaaw! Oh, thank you, Chiefy! You're so sweet. [SQUEALS] Chiefy? I'm here now. Hello? Hmm. Hmm. [CAMERA CLICKS] Cute. [PHONE RINGS] Oh? You're so stubborn. I told you many times. Aside from the fact that he’s married he’s a policeman. You don’t know what you’re getting into, Me-ann! You’re annoying, sister! Just because he’s a policeman, doesn’t mean you can’t trust him, okay? Don’t be judgmental. You don’t know Chief. You don’t know what he’s done for me. That’s what... I’ll remind you again, okay? When we were having problems for our mother’s funeral last year… who saved us? When we were being evicted by the attorney from our apartment in Cubao and his wife scandalized us… who fixed our problems, huh? The two months deposit for the condo, whose money is it? All of it are Chief’s, sis. Maybe you’re forgetting that. Mom didn’t sacrifice for your studies, for you to end up a mistress! I’m not a mistress. What then? A sugar baby? [CALL DROPS] [SIGH] Chiefy? Chief? Chiefy. [DOOR OPENS] Chief? Chief? [BITES INTO AN APPLE] [DOOR OPENS FROM A DISTANCE] Chief? Chief? Chief? [PHONE RINGING] Chiefy? Chiefy? [PHONE RINGS] Why don’t you be happy for me, sister? Is it wrong to love? He doesn’t love you Me-ann. He’s not serious about you. You know, just admit that you’re just jealous, sis. I hit the jackpot with Chief while you put up with your loser husband. You know, let’s do it this way. I’ll move out. I’ll ask Chief for my own condo, okay? Suit yourself! What? Do you hear what you’re saying?! – Chiefy. Are we playing hide and seek? Where’s the toilet? I have to pee.

I’ll just check something downstairs. [DOOR CLOSES] [DOOR CLOSES] [SUSPENSE MUSIC] Most likely that it’s just the switch. But it’s better to be sure. Do you have a gun? Here, Sir. Okay. -Check it. -Okay, Sir. [PHONE RINGS] Hon. Why aren’t you answering? I’ve been texting you. I’m at an operation. And we were just talking earlier, aren’t we? Hon, please. I don’t want to fight. So you think I called to fight with you. So why did you call? I said I’m in an operation. Why are you so grumpy? Why can’t I talk to you? Okay. I’m sorry. Okay? Why did you call? My cousin Myrns wants to confirm if you can still sing and play the piano for her daughter’s wedding. Huh? You can say no. But you know my sister Myrns. If she gets offended I’m sure she’ll bad-mouth you to the whole city council. Fine, fine. Tell her I can sing at her daughter’s wedding. And play the piano? Okay, but tell her that it’s just two songs, okay? Okay, thanks, Hon. Okay, goodnight. Okay, goodnight. [DOG BARKING] Oh, wait. [DOGS BARKING] The boys are also saying goodnight. You hear them? Yes, okay. I have to go, Hon. Ah, I really need to go. Our asset’s here now. Oh, oh, yes. Can you call Dad? Your dad? Why? I think he needs something from you. He's been texting, asking me your whereabouts. Asking if I talked to you… what time you’ll be home… if I know where you are right now. What did you say? I told him what you told me. That you’re in a confidential mission. Just text Dad. Maybe he just needs you to drive him or something. Fine. [EERIE AMBIANCE] [SCREAMS] Baby. What happened? Cockroach. There it is. Cockroach. [WHIMPERS] [ME-ANN SCREAMS] Solve. It’s okay. Relax. It’s just a cockroach. Sit down. Baby… It’s okay. I told you not to go near the window. You disobeyed me. Sorry. Who’s that, Chief? No one. Someone who just wandered here. Someone wandered here? But this is such a remote area. Where are we, Chief? Baby, just know that you’re safe here. You’re protected because, you know, those windows… they are bulletproof. This. Try it. That’s expensive. It came from Argentina. Try it. I think it’s not yet cooked. It’s a bit raw, Chief. See, there’s still some blood on it. Baby… that’s called medium rare. [CHUCKLES] I know that, Chiefy. But it can be fully cooked, right? What’s it called? Well done. Because my stomach aches when I eat raw. No, no, no, no, no. Baby, no. It really must be eaten that way. You know, you should… You should get used to the taste of it. Teach your stomach. So that you’ll be familiar with expensive food. Mmm. Delicious, right? Mmm hmm. I told you, right? [METAL CLANKS] It’s better when it’s raw. Mmm. [CHUCKLES] Wait, wait, Chief. This, for sure… is expensive, right? Well, uhmm. I don’t know much about wine. But my wife, she’s a wine connoisseur so this bottle, is one of her most treasured. Mmm. So if that’s the case, let’s drink it all. We will not leave a drop for her. Sure. Cheers, baby. Cheers, Chiefy. [GLASSES CLANK] Chief. Why did you build a mansion here? This seems so far for a vacation house. This is not mine. Mmm? Whose house is this? My father-in-law’s. Because it is… a retreat house. A retreat? You know, we had that in high school. Wait. Is your father-in-law a priest? Why does he have a retreat house? Oh baby, it’s not that kind of a retreat house. I don’t get it. Never mind. It’s not important. I need to know… if you followed all my instructions while coming here? Of course. You didn’t forget anything? You didn’t skip any of my instructions? No. Why? Fine. Tell me about it. How did you get here? I left my condo. I rode a tricycle… to go to the crossing. And then… I took a taxi. I got off at the family grocery. Then I entered the coffee shop next to it. I took the back exit to go to the parking lot. Then I searched for your car. And then… I saw your driver. He ushered me into your car. He brought me here. So you didn’t tell anyone where you were going? You didn’t post anything in social media? None. Why? Is…is there a problem? Baby… If you want our relationship to last… we need to be careful. The key to our relationship… depends on how long we can hide a secret. Baby. Sorry, I… didn’t get to be with you several times. Mmm It’s okay. I know that you’re busy. What is… one month and ten days that we didn’t see each other? [CHUCKLES] You’ll make it up to me? Mmm. -Sure -Chiefy, no. -Not like that. -What do you like, then? Do you remember giving me this, the last time we were together? Baby, do you want another jewelry? Mmm mmm. Mmm You told me that I have your heart. You told me you’ll give me everything I need. Be straight with me. What does this baby want? It’s my sister, Chiefy. She’s picking a fight with me. She’s saying many things about you. About us. That… I’m just wasting my time… that you’ll just cheat on me eventually… Choo-choo, choo-choo, choo-choo. Mmm. Bitter. Baby. You know that’s not true, right? You know I love you. Mmm. I know. That’s why I said… So that there won’t be a problem… I thought… I’ll just move out. You’ll give me my own condo, right? Not just for me but for us. So that we just don’t meet at random places. So that we’ll have our own place. So when the time comes that you leave your wife… you’ll have a place to come home to. Hmm. You’ll leave her, right? You don’t love her, right? Is that the reason why you called at my house the other night? Even though I told you that it’s forbidden? -You still did it. -Mmm. Chiefy. Are you still mad? Mmm. Don’t be mad anymore. It’s your fault. You don’t reply to all my texts. That’s why I missed you. Don’t be angry. Please. So what now? We will get our own condo. Mmm? It depends. It depends? [KISSES] [CHUCKLES] Thanks, Chiefy. Promise, you won’t regret it. You’ll be happy when you come home to our condo. Mmm. Now, I’m the one who has a request for you. Of course, whatever it is. Since we’re now playing house, we might as well step it up. Let’s have a baby. Baby... A child? You don’t want to? A child? Why? You don’t want to? It’s not that. Uhmm. Chief... it’s not part of my plans yet. Don’t you think I’m too young to be a mother? That’s the beauty of it. Baby, while you’re still young. Look at my wife, she’s old now, that’s why we have a hard time having a child now. Think about it. When we have kids... this relationship will be for keeps. And then your future, our children’s future are secure. Hmm, hmm, huh? Chief, I think it’s not part of my plan yet. I think I’m not ready to be a mother yet. Baby, life is really like that. Sometimes our plans, in an instant can change. Hmm. We don’t know what’s waiting for us tomorrow. Or later. So don’t be afraid of unexpected things. You should always be ready. You should know exactly what you want in life. They say that… [METAL CLANKS] opportunity only knocks once. [METAL CLANKS] You never know… it might just be the realization of your dreams. It’s a waste if you don’t open it, isn’t it? [CAR ALARM HONKS] -Motherfucker -Why? -[CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] -Chief! Uncuff me first. Baby, the keys are downstairs. Stay there. -Huh? -I’ll come back for you. Chief, don’t leave me like this. Please! Baby, please, don’t be difficult. Everything’s going to be fine. Stay there. [CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] Chief! Oh, fuck! [CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] Mang Boy! Chief! There’s someone behind you! [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [GROANS] [GRUNTS] [CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] [CLATTERING IN THE DISTANCE] [CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] [PHONE VIBRATES] [SCREAMS] [CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] Chief? [SQUEALS] [PANTING] Shh. You heard that? You heard them? Shh! Don’t be noisy. You won’t be able to hear them. [WHIMPERS] Who? The children. I know they’re here. I hear them. I don’t know anything. I don’t want this. I don’t know anything, mister. It’s not true. [WHIMPERS] You can’t know nothing. You’re here and you don’t know anything? Nothing! I don’t know anything, mister! It’s my first time to be here. I’m just a visitor. I really don’t know anything. Promise. Swear to die, I don’t know anything. Let me go -- You’re lying. It’s not that you don’t know anything. You just don’t care. Let go of me, let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Shouting won’t help! -Shh! -[WHIMPERS] You shut up! Don’t be noisy! You won’t hear them if you’re noisy. -Shh! Shh! -Please, help! Please, help! Shh! Chief, help! Shouting won’t help! [WHIMPERS] [GROANS] You won’t be saved if you only think about getting out of here. You won’t get out as long as you don’t admit what you’re hiding! [WHIMPERS] And you won’t get out as long as I don’t see my children. [SQUEALS] Neighbors, help! [WHIMPERS] [SCREAMS] [CAR ALARM HONKING CONTINUES] Chief. What’s happening? What is he talking about? Why is he searching for his children? I told you. You should have not called my house the other night. Now he knows about us. Your wife? Her father. Colonel. My father-in-law. Son of a bitch. [SCOFFS] I’m sure he’s the one behind this. He wants to teach me a lesson. Psywar. Just like what he did to the captured communists and terrorists then. [GUN FIRING IN THE DISTANCE] Baby... What’s happening? What’s he doing upstairs? Baby. It's nothing. Blanks. It’s part of the show. Show? A few days before the wedding… My father-in-law called me. We ended up in Sierra Madre. Somewhere in Vizcaya. It was already night time when we got there. Are you okay, son? Can you continue? No problem, Sir. Colonel. Just tell me if you’re already tired, okay? I can still drive. I still have clear eyesight. No problem, Sir. Are we almost there? We’re not in the main road for quite some time now. Don’t tell me, you’re scared of the dark? So how will you protect my youngest? I’m just joking. No, Sir. I’m just concerned we might be lost. So? Sir? I was right about you. I was like you when I was your age. Always in control. Always the one in charge. I knew the way, and I was sure where I was going. I was traversing a straight path, not making any turns. But then again, I realized... I was going nowhere. The straight path that they taught me… didn’t actually get me anywhere but back to where I came from. Are you saying, sir, that it’s okay to get lost? No, no. Son, getting lost is different to making your own way. [CLEARS THROAT] Where are we really going, Sir? Who will you meet? Don’t be scared, son. We’re not lost. Don’t you trust me? Uh no, Sir… that’s not what I mean. Two of my brothers died because of emphysema. I hope you won’t make my youngest a young widow. It’s my first stick for today. Just to get rid of sleepiness, [CLEARS THROAT] But before I finish my cigarette… he told me to slow down. And suddenly… three men were coming near us from the dark. Fuck, we have enemies! Oh, oh, relax, relax. They’re my people. They’ve been waiting for us. Sir, what are we really doing here? Why don’t you relax and go outside? I’ll just talk to them. Go now. [CAR DOOR OPENS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] I tried to listen to their conversation but the crickets were chirping so loud, I couldn’t hear them. [GUN COCKS] Colonel. Where are they going? Let’s go. Let’s follow them. We travelled far for many hours… I’m sure you want to know why we came here. You’ll know in about 500 meters ahead. You want to marry my daughter, right? You have to learn to trust me. Don’t worry. I won’t get you into trouble. I just don’t want my daughter to get hurt. I can’t take it. [CAR DOOR OPENS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [CAR REVS] [SCREAMING] [GUN FIRES] [WOMAN WAILING] [SCREAMING] [WAILING] [CHICKEN CACKLES] [CHICKEN CACKLES] We invaded the farm... [CAR HONKS] and we took the cockfighting roosters. I then found out that they are of imported breed. [CAR REVS] [MEN CHUCKLING] Fuck! What’s your problem? Problem? You’re the one I should be asking! What did we do?! Fuck! You made me drive all day just to steal? Really? Hey. Don’t be so righteous. -Don’t tell me this is your first time doing things like this? -That’s not my point. My point is, why didn’t you tell me about your plan? [SCOFFS] This is part of my plan. Who told you that it’s not part of it? Jack, give me your magazine. Here. See? Blank. All are blanks. Lesson one. Reality is different from the truth. The truth is… we really didn’t steal anything that night. Those cockfighting roosters… [SCOFFS] my father-in-law owns them. And the whole farm… [SCOFFS] he owns it all. [BREATHING DEEPLY] But why? He just wants to teach his men a lesson. Being lazy is forbidden. He just wanted to know how far they will go in protecting his roosters. But most of all… he did it for me. For you? He wanted to show me… what he can do for his loved ones. [CHICKEN CACKLES] [CHICKEN CACKLES] Those are just my roosters. No, uh… I’m not really making threats. I think we’re not going to have problems. My youngest told me… that she really feels your love for her. But people change. I hope you won’t fool my youngest. I hope you will not hurt her. Because if I find out and I’m sure I will find out. I will personally go to your house. Me and my people. Mmm. I will make you feel how angry I am. Yes, Sir. [CHUCKLES] Stop calling me ‘Sir’ or Colonel. Just call me “Papa” because we’re already family. Yes, Boss -- Pa. Good. Do you know what they say about family? A family should be taken care of. A family should be protected. Especially about secrets. Like this night. You understand? Yes. If you need anything... anything at all... don’t hesitate to tell me. Welcome to the family, son. Mmm. It suits you. [GIGGLES] [EXHALES DEEPLY] It’s been two decades since that happened. They still don’t know what really happened that night. Maybe some of them, up to now, are still having nightmares because of it. What if they learn the truth? [CHUCKLES] That their boss just played a game with them. He did all that… just to teach his future son-in-law a lesson. [CHUCKLES] Why did we meet here? Why did you bring me here? Baby, I told you… I do a lot of things for my father-in-law. He wanted his properties checked. This is one of his new properties. It’s bothersome but I can’t say no to him. That’s why I thought… That I should use this chance to meet you. I didn’t know… that he had plans for tonight. Chief. Talk to your father-in-law, say sorry to him. Tell him that we’re not going to do it again, that you’re not going to do it again. Baby, no. That’s not the way. I can’t be weak in his eyes. He doesn’t need my sorry. He wants to teach me a lesson. That fucker… He was sent here to really put on a show. To scare me, to shock me, to hurt me, to make me suffer. But he will not kill me. My father-in-law won’t do that. He can’t face seeing his youngest cry. Fuck, Chief. What about me? He killed Mang Boy. Baby, baby… how did you know that Mang Boy is dead? Fuck, he’ll kill me! Chief. Shh. Shh. Baby, relax. Not everything you see is real. Chief. Shh. Shh. Baby. Baby, look at me. Relax. Everything's going to be fine. Joy! [GUN FIRING] -Love, where are you? -Relax. Your dad is here now. Blanks. All blanks. [GRUNTS] Where did you hide my children? I know that they are here! Bring them to me or I’ll blow her brains out! Wait. I hear them. Shh. I hear the children. Bring me out or I’ll kill all of you. [LAUGHS] Now what?! You want me to act crazy with you? Huh? Motherfucker! How far do you want this to go? I’ll count to three. Where are my children? How much? How much? Oh, that shut you up. Tell me how much he paid you. I know that my father-in-law made you do this. Fucker. Tell me. So that I’ll double it. Just stop this madness. Motherfuck— One! Mister, please, don’t. Don’t. Chief. How much? I’ll double it. No one will know. Tell me. You’ll have more money. You’ll be rich. Two! Fuck, Chief! He doesn’t know what you’re talking about! [SCREAMS] Stop it! He’s just trying to scare us! He’ll kill me! Three! I saw them! I saw them! I saw your children. I saw them. Me-ann, don’t play with that fucker -- I saw them, mister. I’ll tell you if you let me go. [PANTING] You saw my children? Where did you see my children? Here, mister. They were eating here earlier. You fuck, if I learn that you’re lying to me… No, it’s true, mister. I’m telling you the truth. Promise. One… one of them even offered me chocolates but I said no because I’m on a diet. I’m telling the truth. Are you sure that it’s my kids you saw? Yes, mister. [CHAIR SCRAPES] But to be sure, do you have a picture of them? To be certain that it’s really them that I saw. It’s really them. It’s Joy, it’s Joy. Joy offered me the chocolate. Yes, my youngest really likes chocolate. And Love, her older sister… she was actually stopping her sister. Telling her off. She said to stop eating chocolates because it would ruin her teeth. I told my eldest daughter… to take care of his sister. They’re really the ones I saw, mister. Joy was sitting here. And then Love was here. But… I don’t understand. They were eating here? They’re not imprisoned? How did that happen? I also don’t know, mister. It’s true, believe me. Like them, I’m a prisoner in this house. Is that why you were in handcuffs earlier? Yes, mister. I can’t tell you the truth because Chief threatened me. He told me that if I tell you the truth… he would kill me. That’s why you don’t need to tie me up like this. I’m your ally. But… why did they bring you here? What will they do to you and my daughters? What’s their plan for my daughters? I don’t know, mister. I really don’t know. But... [CHAIR SCRAPES] But if you’ll set me free… I’ll be able to help you outside. The boss of my sister’s husband… is an attorney. He can help you in searching for your children. So set me free, mister, please. No, no, no. Aling Mameng told me… that this is the onIy place where I’ll find my daughters. Whoever Aling Mameng is, mister… I think she’s wrong. Your daughters are really not here. No. No, that can’t be. Aling Mameng’s prediction is not wrong. This. This showed me the way to this house. A mansion… that’s made of glass, wood and cement. Aling Mameng said… Right? 40 nights and 40 days that I walked towards the North… to a big house made of glass, wood and cement. I will find where my daughters were taken. But... We can’t tell the police, military or anyone from the authorities because they’re behind this. They are the culprits. No one can help me but myself. I will not find justice if I can’t strike back at them. I can’t die without knowing where my daughters are and what happened to them. You saw them, right? Right? You said that, right? You told me you saw them -- [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] You fucker! [GRUNTS] [CHOKING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [GLASS BREAKS] [SQUEALS] [GRUNTS] [SHOUTS] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] Let me go! Let me go! [SCREAMS] You think they’ll help you. You think you can hide in this house. [DOOR CREAKS] Love! Joy! Open the door downstairs. Bring me my daughters! Chief! I don’t know what you’re talking about! You sick fuck! [GRUNTS] Chief, help! [GRUNTING] Chief! [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] Chief! [GRUNTS] Chief, help! Me-ann! Chief! Wake up. Open the door. My daughters! Love, Joy, your dad is here now! Wake up! Wake up! My daughters! Joy? Joy? Love? My daughters! Joy! Love! Open this! Open this! My daughters, do you hear me? [DOOR BANGING] Fuck! Open this door! My daughters! My daughters! Love! Love, where are you? [DOOR BANGING] My daughters! Joy! My daughters! Open this door! My daughters! [SOBBING] My daughters are inside, imprisoned. I feel them. I hear them. Mister… What happened? How… how did you lose them? They were not lost. They were kidnapped. And one night, they were taken from me by masked men. -Dad! -I’m asking you, Chief. Are you Soliman? The driver of Mr. Ferrer? -Yes. Yes, it’s me. -[GIRLS SCREAMING] Joy! Joy! Please don’t! Joy! Tell your boss, Colonel said that… if he wants to see his son alive… he should just call. And no police. Get it, Chief? My daughters. Please don’t involve them in this. Please! We’ve got nothing to do with what he’s done to you! None! We’re just the same, Chief. I’m sorry. Just obeying orders. [VEHICLE REVS] Colonel. I wanted to ask my boss who Colonel is. And what’s his connection to the kidnapping of our children. Remember, you’ll pay for this! Stop it! Stop it! Enough! [SOBBING] -Sir, how – - Fine, fine, fine. Go now. I’ll take care of it. You won’t do anything, okay? You won’t make a move. Wait for my call. [ECHOING GIRLS CRYING, SCREAMING] Joy! Joy! [ECHOING GIRLS CRYING, SCREAMING] Joy! Joy! [OVERLAPPING VOICES] [GLASS CLANKS] [REPORTER] Sir, sir, how did you -- [REPORTER] The only son of business mogul, Mr. Ramon Ferrer was finally saved from his kidnappers. [REPORTER] You can clearly see the couple’s happiness now that their son is back with them. [REPORTER] We will continue to find more information and details about this incident. [REPORTER] The authorities will also have a manhunt operation to find the suspects. [DIALING] [RINGING OVER THE PHONE] Mr. Ferrer! Mr. Ferrer! Fuck! Mr. F -- Son of a bitch! Mr. Ferrer, come out! Fuck! My daughters! Mr. Ferrer! Fuck -- Where are my daughters?! Why are they haven’t found yet? [WHINES] Mr. Ferrer! Mr. Ferrer, where are you?! You, fucker! Son- of-a – Where are my daughters?! Where are my daughters, Mr. Ferrer?! Motherfucker! [GRUNTS] Mr. Ferrer, fucker! You deceived me! Mr. Ferrer! [WHINES] My daughters! Sir, sir. You’re causing disturbance here! Please wait, Sir. My daughters! - Just explain at the precinct. - What did I do, Sir? My daughters were taken, Sir. That’s trespassing. [GRUNTS] Sir. Sir! Sir, help me. Help my daughters! They were taken with my boss’ son, Sir. Help my kids. Come now. You can explain at the precinct. Sir! Sir, wait, Sir! -Sir! -Aren’t you going to stop?! They said that why would the police believe me. Aside from my story… what evidence do I have. They said, why did I just show up then. Why did I just complain then. They said that I might have something to do with the kidnapping of my boss’ son. But others said… they’re already gone. Killed by their kidnappers. They said that maybe the ransom wasn’t enough. That’s why my boss’ son was the only one set free. If they are still alive… maybe they were sold. For profit. [BREATHES DEEPLY] [SNIPPING HAIR] [SHOUTS] [GRUNTS] Your daughters are still alive. I see them, I hear them. They rode a vehicle going to a remote area. -And they were taken in a deserted place. -They were unconscious. They were asleep during the ride. When they woke up, it was already sunset. Please don’t forget chief’s instruction. Chief? Chief? Shh. [CHUCKLING] Here, inside… My daughters are imprisoned. In one dark room. My daughters are imprisoned. My daughters are imprisoned. My daughters are imprisoned. But… how did you get here? For 40 days and 40 nights, I walked towards North. Until my body gave up. My feet gave up. I lost strength. But not hope. Until I was led to them. [CAR HONKS] [CAR HONKS] Hey! Get out of the way! Do you want to die, Chief? I followed where his vehicle went. And it brought me... here, exactly at this house that I was looking for. The big house made of glass, wood and cement. I can’t be mistaken. That was the opportunity I’ve been waiting for. Finally... I can do something to save my daughters. Here… inside this door… my daughters are here. They are locked up here. Since I walked towards North for 40 days and 40 nights. My daughters! My daughters! 40 days and 40 nights. One month and ten days that we didn’t see each other. Do you remember this thing you gave me the last time we met? Baby. Baby. You escaped? Quick. Set me free. Hey! We don’t know what you’re talking about! We’ve got nothing to do with your missing daughters. You fuck, you’re a drug addict! I’ll kill you! That fucker! He’s an addict! I’m sure of it. You’re wrong, Chief. Your father-in-law didn’t bring him here to teach you a lesson or scare us. This is not a show. All of these are real. We won’t get out of here if he doesn’t find his daughters. I’m sure. That fucker is a drug addict. He said that… Mang Boy kidnapped his daughters. He said that Colonel ordered it. Baby, you should not believe that addict. That my father-in-law is involved. When Mang Boy brought me here, he said that you were inside. I searched for you. But you were not around. You even suspect me? Where were you, Chief? Were you here? Baby, wait. I’m your ally here. Come on. When you gave me this… I remember that you had a lot of money. You said that you hit the jackpot. Baby, I don’t understand. How is it connected to what’s happening now? Is it related to what’s happening now? Are you one of his daughters’ kidnappers? Son of a bitch. Now I’m a kidnapper? Then what, Chief? I want this to end! I want to know the truth! The truth? You want to know the truth? This is the truth… I don’t know anything about that fucking door! And whatever that addict says! I’m not involved. I don’t know him. I’ve never seen his missing daughters, ever. And when you were looking for me… I was covering for you. I was there, upstairs. I was inside the bathroom because I was talking to my wife. She was asking where I was. I was explaining – I can’t tell her that I’m cheating on her. Your necklace… Baby, I worked hard for that. For a long time, I worked hard for that. Do you know why I do everything for you? Why I give you everything you want? Because I love you. Fuck, I love you. That’s why, baby… it hurts me. It pains me that after everything I’ve done for you… up to now, you still don’t trust me. Baby. That’s the truth, baby. Sorry. [SOBS] Sorry, Chief. It’s not your fault. Sorry, baby. It’s not your fault. It’s not our fault. Both of us are victims. But what I don’t understand is, what’s behind that door? And why is there a door in the wall? What’s inside of it? Baby. I don’t know. It’s my first time to see that door. Even my father-in-law doesn’t know. Because this is a new property. For sure he’s got nothing to do with that. But you said that this is a retreat house? What does it really mean? My father-in-law said… that whenever he has problems with his business partners. He brings them here. Because it’s peaceful… far from the city. They relax here. They unwind here. Like an overnight retreat. Then the next day… their minds are clear… problems are fixed… everything’s solved and discussed. So the business continues. Business? What kind of business? Kidnapping? Carnapping? It’s impossible that you don’t know. Baby, I don’t know and I don’t want to know. Fine. Call me a coward. But sometimes… in the middle of a fight, you need to learn to shut your eyes. You need to learn to be silent. Sometimes you need to play dead in order to come out alive. Don’t you want to know the truth? Don’t you want to know what’s really happening here? You don’t want to help his daughters? Because Mister Soliman might be right. Maybe his daughters are really there. Don’t you want to help them? Chief, you said you’re a policeman, aren’t you? The night we first met… you remember? You said that you swore to protect everyone. Everyone who needs it. Don’t you want to help them now? How will I do that? I’m tied up here. My father-in-law is now forgetful. He can’t even remember his own birthday. The only thing he remembers is… his wife’s birthday. And of course… the birthday of his beloved youngest. My wife. Now, if my father-in-law’s not involved here… You’ll finally learn your father-in-law’s secret, Chief. Joy? Love? Love? My daughters? Joy? My daughters? Where are you? Joy! My – Shout so I can hear you! Joy! Where are you? Joy. My daughters. [SOBBING] My daughters? Joy! Love! Joy! My daughters. Mister... Your daughters are really not here. Sorry... sorry. That can’t be! You fuck! You fuckers! You’re just playing with me. Fuck you! Fuck you, you’re just playing games with me! Motherfuckers, you make me go round in circles! Where have you taken my daughters? What did they do wrong? Why did you involve my daughters? Fuck you! Mister, please. Enough now. Your daughters are really not here. We don’t know where your daughters are. Even if you kill us… it would not benefit you so… please, stop now. Enough. [SOBS] What did we do to you? What wrong did my daughters do? We didn’t do anything wrong. We’re not at fault. My daughters are innocent. We didn’t do anything wrong. [SOBBING] Why did you involve my daughters in your problems? We live peacefully. We were living peacefully. My daughters are innocent. We didn’t do anything wrong. None. We’re innocent. Mister, don’t worry. I’ll help you spread the news about what happened to your daughters. [SOBBING] We didn’t do anything wrong. [GUN FIRES] -Fuck! -Stop resisting. Let go of me. No! -No! Don’t! -Stop resisting. -[GRUNTING] -Come on. No! Don’t resist. -Let me go! -I’ll pay you. I’m not a prostitute! I’m not a prostitute! You fool! Don’t get out, hey! Motherfucker! Hey! Come back here! [CRYING] Help! Help! Please, help! Help! Help me. Help me, please. [SOBS] What is it? Rapist! Rapist! [SOBS] Mang Boy. Miss. Miss. Relax, relax. Fucker! Don’t you dare runaway! - No, no please. Don’t shoot. - We’re the police! No! Please! I didn’t do anything wrong. I have a cousin. He’s with a party list. I can show you his ID, please! Get out! Motherfucker! Miss. What’s your name? Me-ann, Sir. Me-ann. Don’t worry. You’re safe now. Thank you very much, Sir. Thank you. It’s good that you came. Thank you. No. You don’t need to thank me. We’re the police. It’s our sworn duty to protect and help everyone who needs it. Who is he to you? Your boyfriend? No. Not really. I just met him at the car show event earlier. My friends and I were just invited for dinner. And there’s free drinks. So it’s your fault. Why did you just go with him like that? You don’t even know him. He was nice earlier. He’s educated and… He said that he’s the president of his company. We were also hungry. And we wanted to have some fun. You’re lucky, we passed by. If we didn’t, maybe something bad already happened to you. I didn’t know that it would end up like this. I swear, he was nice earlier. One by one, he brought all of my friends home. Then when I was the only one left… I suddenly felt dizzy. I suspect that he put something in my drink. I swear, I’m telling the truth. Yes, yes. Relax, relax. Don’t worry. I believe you. [CLEARS THROAT] I’m on your side. I want to go home now. My Mom might be looking for me now. My phone… -I think I left my phone at the car. -Okay, okay. I’ll take care of it. I’ll get it. I just need to know… what are your plans about that guy? I want him punished. That bastard! He should have death penalty. Not just once but many times. You’re right. I feel the same. We can bring him to the precinct. Open a case against him. But you know… I can already see what’s going to happen. I’m sure he will deny all your statement. Most likely, he will say that you’re in a relationship with him. And you’re just making up a story about rape to extort money from him. He’s a liar, then. You’re my witness, right? Yes but Me-ann… We can’t lie in the court. What did we actually see? You were running in the middle of the road. The truth is… we really don’t know what happened inside the car. What do you want me to do? Let him go? Is that it? No. I’m not saying anything like that. Because if it’s up to me, that person should be punished. He must be taught a lesson. Me-ann… I want you… to know that no one can hurt you. No matter who it is. I want… to bring back your braveness. For your courage to come back. I want you to forget everything that happened tonight. And for you to sleep peacefully. When you wake up tomorrow morning, I want you to smile. Me-ann… I want you to know that… when you’re with me… you’re safe. Just nod. I can give you all of it. Okay. Rest now. I’ll take care of it. Sir. What will you do to him? Come on. Stop calling me ‘Sir’. Just Chief. Let me take care of you, baby. [CAR DOOR OPENS] [CAR DOOR CLOSES] [SOBBING] Give it to me. [GRUNTS] You fucker! [CALM MUSIC] Baby! I'm sorry, baby. This should not have happened. It was supposed to be an awesome night. That fucking addict. At least… At least you’re safe now. Everything's going to be fine. Where are his daughters? Where are they? Are they here? Did you kill them? Baby, didn’t you think… Why does my father-in-law bring his business problems to this house? In a deserted place. We don’t want trouble. We don’t want fights, we don’t want bloodshed. We always try to solve it with a peaceful solution. Everything… can have a peaceful solution, right? Like when they came from a retreat. Those that can be corrected… will be corrected. Former enemies… become friends. Those who need to be taught a lesson… will be taught a lesson. [CHUCKLES] You see, baby. When everybody's happy... everybody makes money. Business continues. I’m not a part of your business. But you benefit from it, don’t you? You’re a part of this because your whole family benefits from it. Right?! All of them benefit from it. Don’t they?! We can still benefit from it in the future. Baby, that’s what you need to understand. My father-in-law… he’s old now. He won’t last long. When he dies, who do you think will inherit his businesses? All of his properties! This! Me. Baby, I’m sure he will be very happy with me right now. I’ve solved a problem of his that he didn’t even know was coming. Condo... penthouse... mansion, farm, whatever you like. I can give you that. You need to understand, baby. It’s you that I protect. Our future. What’s your problem? What? You suddenly have a conscience now? Son of a bitch. Don’t play innocent with me. Since the beginning, you knew what you’ve gotten yourself into. - Baby. - I don’t want it anymore. We’re over. I don’t want it anymore. We’re over? [LAUGHS] Over -- Baby... I’m sorry. What stupidity is this? I think it’s better that you… clean yourself. Take a shower. Get something to eat. And then... Baby will now rest. Later, I’ll call my driver to pick you up. He will bring you to your house. You’ll forget about everything that happened tonight. If you remember something… just close your eyes. Go to sleep. When you wake up… it’ll be gone from your mind. Just do that process. Repeatedly. Eventually, it’ll be gone from your memory. Just like… a bad dream… that even if you want to tell someone… it’s already gone. Okay, baby? Listen to me. Don’t defy me. Tomorrow. We’ll meet tomorrow. We’ll look for a condo that you can move into. So you don’t have to depend on your sister. You’re right. What you’re saying is right. We need to prepare for our own living arrangement. Mmm. Baby. Hey, wait. [CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY] Baby, put it down -- please. Baby, come here. Come here. I’m wide awake now. You can’t deceive me anymore. I love you, baby. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTING] [SCREAMS] [GRUNTS] [SHOUTS] Motherfucker! [SCREAMS] [DOOR BANGING] [GUN FIRES] [GRUNTS] You’re so stupid! You choose them over what I can give you?! For people who are strangers to you! That fucking addict! You don’t know them! Why don’t you listen to me?! Why don’t you just shut up?! You won’t go anywhere! You won’t leave this house alive! Fuck! [GLASS SHATTERS] Me-ann! What do you think will happen here? What? You’ll tell the whole world what happened here tonight?! Do you think someone will believe you?! Fool! You’ll end up like him! They’ll call you crazy! Addict? What? You’ll tell the truth? Stupid! No one will know the truth! [BANGING ON THE DOOR] Me-ann! Because what I say is the truth. That’s what people will believe. [GUN FIRES] Baby! [GUN FIRES] [DOOR OPENS] Me-ann... last chance. I can still fix this. I can still save this. Just nod. Baby. Just nod. Baby. Just nod, baby. Baby. [SOBS] [SHOUTS] [GRUNTS] [SOBS] [SOBBING] [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR CLOSES] [ENGINE STARTS] [VEHICLE CRASHES THE GATE] [TIRES SCREECH] A Silent Night
