What is going on? Deepak has come. He will decide. Yes, he will decide. What is going on Pinto? Deepak, we were playing cards and he made the wrong move. Now you tell us what should we do? All of you do this all day? And Pinto aren't you ashamed? You were an ordinary cleaner I thought you to drive. I got you a license on my recommendation. But you gamble here all day. Gambling is for the rich and not for poor people like us... ...who are responsible for their old parents. Give this to me. What are you waiting for? Go on. Sunder, did you come home in the morning? Yes Deepak. Did you have some work? I wanted your opinion. I am going home. I got rent from Kalbadevi in the morning. Let's have a cup of tea. Shyam, give us 2 cups of tea. Yes. Take this. Now tell me, what's the matter? Deepak, some or the other trouble always comes up. I received a letter from the village. Mother has gone totally blind. That is really bad. But you had got her treated? What do I do? I spent all the money on her treatment. But one cannot defy fate. And the biggest problem is that... ...I have a young sister. How will mother look after her? What have you decided? I've planned to leave my job here & work as a driver there. It is not a bad idea. You're an honest man. There's no shortage ofjobs for such a man. You will get some or the otherjob. But till I don't get ajob, I have to manage the expenses. Then why are you getting so upset? If you require about Rs. 50100, then come home and take it. I'd saved money for installment for my car. I'll pay that later. I will be grateful. You are helpful to everyone. But... Now stop all this, come home in the morning and take the money. I will be grateful... Drink your tea. Stop talking nonsense and go. Okay. Shyam, put the bill in my account. You are so generous! Uncle! You think about everyone. Sometimes think of yourself too. If Sunder had a sister, even you do. And the scoundrel Kishan troubles her. No one can dare even look at my sister. Okay. But how long will you remain a bachelor? Listen to me, and get married. Once you get your wife, even you will... ...relieved of your sister's responsibility. You are right uncle, but where do I get such a wife... ...who will take my sister's responsibility. I know a very good girl. She is an orphan and just has a younger brother. She teaches the society children to take care of him. God has even made her beautiful. I know them very well. They are from a decent family. Come. Greetings uncle. Greetings, child. Where's your sister? She must be coming. Uncle, take a seat. Uncle. How come you are here? Child, I have come for an auspicious deed. Auspicious deed? What's it? Sit down, I'll tell you. Take a seat children. Ramu, keep this inside. First, meet him. He is Deepak. Consider him my son. He has his own taxi. And she is sister, Laxmi. How is he to look at? Uncle, what are you saying? Child, I have got a marriage proposal for you. See for yourself. If God wishes to get you together, you will. Ramu, talk to him. But what will I say? Anything. Do you have your parents? No, our parents expired in our childhood. Do you have your parents? Even we are orphans like you. Where are you from? Rawalpindi. What about you? We are from Lahore. Did you come here after the partition? Yes. How many brothers and sister are you? Only the two of us. What about you? Just the two of us. What do you say Deepak? As you say uncle. What about you child? As you wish uncle. Then here, have some sweets. I had got the sweets. Here, child. Take some. What happened? The kids are awake. Kids! Oh, you mean those two? No, they have gone to sleep. Talk slowly. They might hear you. Krishna, it is a small house. But till now we didn't feel the need of a bigger house. It is said that once a woman steps into a house... ...she gets along lots of wealth. With you in my house, God knows even I might get lucky. And one day we might buy a huge house. It is not so. I won't miss anything wherever you are there. My heaven is in these eyes. Come on, get up. The taxi has been cleaned. Now go to work. Get up. Forgive me for sleeping late Krishna. After a long time I had a peaceful sleep. What is this? You have a broom? What kind of a bride are you? You started work from today itself. If you had a motherinlaw, she would've cared for you for. She would have looked after you. Who cleaned the taxi? I woke up Ram. He cleaned it. Come on get up. I made breakfast for you, eat it and go to work. Afterall you are a taxi driver's wife... ...you talk about work early in the morning. You're a newly wed, if you don't work for a day, we won't starve. No, first we have to work. If we don't then how will we save money for Laxmi's marriage? You have come here as my wife or as my mother? You are already worried about Laxmi's marriage? Yes. I am like a mother to Laxmi. A sisterinlaw is like a mother. Really, is that so? From now on you're responsible for Laxmi and I for Ramu. Laxmi will be your sister and Ramu will be my brother. Okay? Now serve the breakfast. I will take you out. Out? Yes. I am not stupid enough to go to work so soon after marriage. Give me the broom... Come on... Enchanting, are your eyes... ...where will my heart escape to I stop and I bow... ...wherever I see your face Enthralling, is my Beloved Where will I find someone like you I stop and I bow... ...wherever I see your shadow My heart is crazy for you Now the whole world is foreign to my heart You are wherever I look Over here, over there and all over I am crazy after you I think of you only Your love took me... ...here, there, and all over My life depends on your love I worship every move you make I will have a love... ...wherever you look Sir, your face is glowing, has the silver & gold price gone up? Shankar's mother! Now what work do you have with me? You are talking as if I have divorced you. Received our son's letter. Then what is there to laugh about? Without our only son, how will we celebrate Diwali. Doctor, you're responsible for saving my life. God bless you. Okay, now you rest. Munna, will eat a toffee? Yes doctor. Here. Doctor, you are spoiling him. You get sometime for him everyday. Because he is my friend. Right Munna? Yes, once I get well, will you play cricket with me? Sure. And I will get out on your first ball. And when I bowl, you make a good score. Mr. Rai, it's you! You are sitting here? That chair was vacant. That's the doctor's chair. The doctor is at your service. You are the owner of this nursing home. Shankar, nursing home is not a business... ...that it has an owner. It is an organization I opened in service for the needy. I had comebecause I am going... ...to participate in the All India Transport Conference. I had come to tell you that... ...I am giving the cheque for Rs. 50,000 you had asked... ...for the new Xray machine to the manager. Take it whenever you need it. Come on. Accountant, come here. I cannot read. Tell me, ho much do I weigh? How much do I weigh, accountant? This weighing machine weighs upto 200 kgs. It reaches it's limit when you keep just one of your foot... ...then what will the accountant tell you? You shouldn't be jealous of someone elses good health. Wow, what good health! Wherever she steps the ground sinks 2 inches. I am going to the shop, if someone calls... ...give them the jewelry shop's number. Understand? I remember the number. It is 550213. Yes Gorakh. Why are you wearing a black coat? When some people ask for something from God... ...they keep a kind of fast. Even I have asked for something, and till it is not fulfilled... ...I will wear this black coat. What problem do you have? I don't have any problem. My sister has a problem. Your sister? Till now I have never given your sister any trouble. Others father 57 children. I have just given her the trouble of Shankar once. Then what have you wished for? Brotherinlaw, I've decided, till she doesn't lose 40 kgs... ...I won't stop wearing this black coat. Then Gorakh, keep wearing this coat all your life. I am getting late. I have to check the stock in the shop. Brotherinlaw, you are leaving? Give me Rs. 100. I have just a Rs. 1000 bill. Okay give me Rs. 1000, I'll return Rs. 900 to you. Has anyone in your family seen Rs. 900? In your sister's marriage, your father spent only Rs. 750. And tied me down with these 750 kgs. It is still cheap, it came up to just 1 rupee per kg. Nowadays mutton costs 5 Rs. Per kg. I have told you so many times not to go on with him. He will either make fun of me or our family. Sister, who else does he have? Other than us who else will he make fun of? Look, I have got an amazing piece for you. Sister, your body fat will flow out of your body. Drink it with lemon juice for 40 days and you'll lose 40 kgs. Is this a new medicine? It's come on earth for the 1st time. Ashes of the moon.' Thanks to my American friend Armstrong... ...who has given me this piece for Rs. 2500. So will I lose weight if I eat these ashes of the moon? Don't you read the papers? Everything on the moon is light. Everything is feather light on the moon. Within 40 days brotherinlaw will ask, Who is this damsel?' Sister, my American friend is going back to America. Give me Rs. 2500. Yes, I'll just get it. Hurry up. The Fatso is trapped! Kishan aren't you going to work today? Since I've seen Deepak's sister, I don't feel like working. Talk slowly, if Deepak hears you, he will kill you. I am not committing a sin... ...I want to get married to Laxmi. Stop dreaming. I know what all Deepak expects for Laxmi's wedding. Even I am very determined, I will do anything for love. Have you cleaned the car? Yes sir. Mr. Deepak, your younger sister's name is Laxmi, right? Yes, what's the matter? You have done us many favors. Kishan has wrong intentions towards Laxmi. I heard this for the second time today. Send a cup of strong tea. Okay. What's the matter Deepak? Kishan, I am a decent man... ...but if I come down to being bad, I can be merciless too. But what have I done? You are asking me that! If you ever even take my sister's name, I'll kill you. It's been ages since I met you. After St. Xavier we didn't meet. That is in the hands of destiny. Have you become a lawyer? Yes, or why would I wear this coat? Have you passed B. A? Do you get the degree of law without being a graduate? I was asking because you were quite dumb in the college days. That was because you were with me. I mean 6 months after you left I got my degree. What are you doing here? I had come to buy jewelry. What? This is my shop. Yours. So you practice law and sell jewelry too. I practice law, and my father sells jewelry. But this is Mr. Shyamlal's shop. Which law states that my father cannot have that name? Here he comes. What? My father has come. Why didn't your father talk to you? He keeps a fast of not talking on Tuesdays. Gorakh, please get me a taxi. Why a taxi? When will this car be of use? Driver tell father, that I took the car. Tell him to come home in the tram. Come, take a seat. Do you have Rs. 5? Take it from sister. Is there water in the house? I want to take a bath. Yes, there is. This's a house and not a playground. Why do you whistle? Sister, you always keep scolding me. Sister, look at my photograph. Just Rs. 2 for 4 copies. It is very cheap. Look sister, how your brother looks in the photograph. Even in the photo you look crooked. As you do now. From the past few days I noticed you keep making fun of me. Don't you love me anymore sister? Can a sister stop loving her brother? Not only my brother, you are everything to me. But I've noticed that you are not behaving properly nowadays. Sister, you unnecessarily worry about me. I read, I write. There's just one educated man in this house. I can take care of myself. How will you? You can't even stand properly. While talking you will be moving here and there. Laxmi, you are laughing at me. Let brother come, I will complaint & teach you a lesson. Yes, surely complain, I am not scared of you. If brother gets angry at me, my sisterinlaw will save me. Yes sure. As if you are the only one dear to her. Keep your face like that, you look very beautiful. Why are you coming in a taxi? Why? Can't I? You always answer me like that. You must have lend the car to someone. No madam, your brother took the car. It doesn't matter. Poor boy, must have some urgent work. Come, dear brother. God knows why he was named Gorakh? My parents could have named my Shyamlal also. But then I would have been your brotherinlaw. Gorakh, you had taken the car? Yes. It must be some important work. Did you finish it? No sister. It was done just half way. What work was it? It is not something you can do in this age. Then why did you take my car? Because I needed a private car. It could not be done in a taxi. Don't you dare touch my car from now. Don't talk as if I am a stranger. I have always respected you like my father. If you want proof, then you can ask anybody. It's a different think that I smoke a pipe in front of you... ...it's the modern times, I chew tobacco... Don't talk nonsense. Just tell me did you get my car back as it was. Brotherinlaw, why are you being so childish? What use is the car, which is not in a part of an accident? I have given it in the garage. Did you have an accident? Have patience and listen to me. It's an interesting story. I was driving, and in my way came a tree. I blew the horn, but the tree didn't move. Then I turned the steering. Then a buffalo came in my way. IU told her to move, but she did not understand my language. You killed the buffalo? I am not stupid enough that I will kill an innocent animal. I saved it and run over a 70 year old woman. And she died saying,Oh God! Now what'll happen? Whatever I told you could have happened. It didn't happen. You car is standing outside on all it's 4 tyres. I knew that my brother is joking. Yes. Your father played the biggest prank on me. That he made your sister my wife... ...and for daily humor send me a brotherinlaw for dowry. You have become very light. Did you eat that? Talk slowly, he might hear you. I had eaten that. Armstrong wrote a letter from Italy. Really? He said he is sending a bag full of mud from the moon. That will wash off all your extra pounds. You should first dry your head, what if you catch a cold? I have just 2 hands. How can I wipe my body and head at the same time? You have four hands, Two mine and two yours. Give it to me. Forget it! Why? Give it to me. What happened? When a beautiful woman... ...that too a wife. Lovingly wipes ones head, then why won't he be in 7th heaven? Forget it! You think up mischief even in this age. This age! This is the right age to make mischief. If Laxmi comes and sees us, what will she think? What will she think. That we both love each other. Let her think, thinking that is not bad. She can think something else too. No, she cannot. Leave me, come on, leave me. Here, I did. Why were you giving me a massage, nothing has happened to me. I know what you were telling my sisterinlaw. What was I saying? I was not saying anything. Brother, I am not a kid anymore. I understand anything. Sisterinlaw, look brother has got something for me. And he is hiding it from me. What have I got? What you have hidden in the car. In the car? I didn't get anything, nor have I hidden it. What are you saying? What is this? Where did this bag come from? Give it to me. Why should I? First let me show it to her, what is there in it. Oh God! So much money! With brother? Oh, so you earn and keep it in your taxi and not in the house? Make him understand, why does he not buy his own taxi. Yes... It's not my money. It belong to someone else. Someone forgot it in the taxi. My money is gone. How can it disappear? We will find it. Sister, brotherinlaw! Found it? Obviously not! I am telling you, you have lost it. If you had given me that Rs. 10,000... Sir, try to remember, did you forget the bag in the shop? I sat in the taxi with you, you yourself gave me the bag. Do you remember the taxi's number? Accountant, that is our car's number. Do you remember the driver's face? Madam, I have been working for you for 10 years... ...I don't even remember your face till now. Tell me who else was there in the taxi. You are asking questions like the police. I was there and he was there, who else? You are lying. There was the taxi driver too. I have understood who took the money. Then tell me. Either the taxi driver, or this accountant took it. Oh God! Madam, I have trouble handling a rupee... ...how will I manage Rs. 10,000? That depends on the person. Why don't you depend on me? Try giving me a lakh or 2, I'll manage it so well... ...you won't even know. What are you thinking? It's a matter of Rs. 10,000! Call the police. Have some patience, why call the police? So you now when I mentioned the police you are worried? I will call up right away. Greetings! You have brotherinlaw's bag of money? Yes, I have come to return it. He forgot it in the taxi. Why are you making a mistake? Why are you giving away money you got? Listen, you keep half and give me half. Thank you. I will give it to the one it belongs to. The old man had saved money by draining the poor. Come and give it to him. Come. It's Mrs. Shyamlal speaking... Found it. Found it! The bag is found. Show it to me... You keep quiet! Sir, you had forgotten this bag in my taxi. Just check if it has all the things. If one has good intentions, it is totally good. Even then check it for my satisfaction. I am satisfied. In a world where people... ...don't repay the loans they take... ...has honest men like you too? Sir, a livelihood of honesty... ...is more satisfying than thieving. You said what was in my heart. Forgive me, I forgot to invite you to take a seat. Please sit. What will you have? Thank you. But I have to take the taxi. You forgot my name so soon? It is not Shamdi, it is Shamli. What difference does it take. Is the coast clear? What do you mean? I mean is your father home or has gone out? Who has come? Father, I told you about my college friend... Oh, the lawyer? What do you mean? My name is Gorakh. I am Balusingh. Mr. Gorakh, what's your name. I mean what's your full name? That's my full name, but you can call me anything. You can call me Gorakhnath, or Gorakhdhanda. Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you I thought that you might be a little junglee'(wild). But you're good enough. What do you mean, I am ajunglee? Your daughter told me that you work... ...in the Forest Department from 2530 years. Does a man become ajunglee by working in the Forest Department? Why not? According to law 1503... ...if a man stays in Delhi, he is called a Delvi. One staying in Jaipur is called a Jaipuri... ...so one living in ajungle can be called ajunglee. After all he is a lawyer, he will have smart answers. He is a lawyer as well ajester. Child, you talk, I have to go out for something important. Your father is so shameless. He kept talking and didn't offer the guest a seat. You are the 1st youth to be allowed to come in the house. Did old men come before me? You're still ajoker. How must you be fighting in court? A man doesn't do that. The law degree helps one to do that. Want to see an example? Yes. Consider that you are a witness and I am the lawyer. And I am interrogating you. First say... I swear to say the truth, nothing but the truth. Did you act in Waris'? I did not, but I had seen it. Doesn't matter, even then you are no less than any actress. First question. What's your age? 18 years. Wrong, you had said the same age 2 years ago in college. Once you say something to a lawyer, you should stick to it. Very intelligent. 2nd question. Have you ever fallen in love? I never got the chance till now. A beautiful girl like you should have 56 men around her... ...like flies around a piece of sweet. I am not a cheap girl. Some men had tried to interfere in my personal life... ...but my father has a 2 barrel gun. O God! You father even has a license to shoot. My license had expired, I got a new one made, look at this. What are you showing me? I am myself going to expire. Shamli, I'll be leaving. Goodbye. Laxmi, didn't come home? You had taken her, she was going to come back with you. I had left after leaving her at the theater. I reached there around 10 minutes late to pick her up. I looked around, when I didn't find her... ...I thought she must have come walking. How can she walk down from so far? Even you are sometimes stupid. She is a young girl, and no one is to be trusted. I don't understand. Nowadays Laxmi is acting stupid. I had told her not to go the movie. What's wrong with that? But you should have reached there on time. Now, what should I do? Now why worry, she must be coming. Let her come, I'll teach her a lesson today. You're getting angry unnecessarily, when she comes... Brother you had told me, you will pick me up from the hall. I was waiting for you for 10 minutes. People were staring at me, I got scared. Yes Deepak, Laxmi was waiting for you. I was passing by, and my taxi was empty. I though you may be busy, so I dropped her home. Okay Deepak, I'll leave. Laxmi, come here. Why were you in such a hurry to come home? Couldn't you have waited for me for some time? Brother, I was waiting for you. Kishan came and said that you had sent him. So, I came with him. If anyone comes to you and tells you I sent him... ...will you go with him too? Can't you think? Shameless! You go around with wrong men. Don't you know what kind of a man Kishan is? Forgive me brother. I made a mistake. Tell me, the show got over half an hour back... ...why did you take so long on the way? Brother... What are you going on about? Tell me. On the way my friend Kamla stopped the taxi at her place... ...she insisted I have tea. I am coming from there. You were having tea? Laxmi, listen to me carefully. If you even step out of the house without my permission... ...then I will kill you! Now why are you crying? Go inside! Krishna, I shouldn't have been so angry on Laxmi. Go, she must be crying. Make her understand. I knew that. Here comes the golddigger! What are you? He is joking Ramu. We have decided to have a party from you. Me? Why not? Can't you spend some money for your friends? You boast so much. Why won't I. I am no less than a Prince. You will be grateful. I will treat you to dinner tomorrow. Very good! Three cheers for Ramu. What is it? Come here. What's the matter? Aren't you sleepy? No. Come here. I won't. You won't? What can I do? I am not getting any sleep. Close your eyes properly, you will fall asleep. You close them for me. I wake you up, not put you to sleep. There's a problem. You'll have to stay awake with me all night. You are just like a kid. What are you doing? I am a kid, right? Get up. Laxmi will get up. Get up! Here's the money. Satisfy your hunger and quench your thirst. I am fortunate to have you here. Please come. Deepak, you house is small but it is very clean and tidy. It is a poor man's hut. But why did you bother to come here? If you had some work, you could have called for me I didn't have any work, but l had heard that you are not well. I am not well? Yes. Nothing has happened to me sir. Someone had said, so l thought to ask how you were. I was also going to get a doctor along. Thank you... ...but someone misinformed you. I was about to go for work. Then Deepak, I am very happy. Why are you standing sir, please take a seat. I'm standing because I'm surprised... ...that there's no one else to be seen in the house. In the excitement of meeting you I forgot to call the others. I'll just call them. Krishna, Laxmi, look who has come. Sir, she is my wife. Bless you child. You are lucky to have a honest man like him for a husband. And she is my younger sister, Laxmi. Bless you child. May God give you a good fate. You didn't tell us who he is. Oh yes, I forgot. He is Mr. Shyamlal. He is a very rich man. He has a big jewelry shop. It is full of gold, silver and diamonds. His heart shines just like his shop. He is a very decent and courteous man. Do you remember the bag that was left in my taxi? Do you remember? It was his bag. So, he the one? God has been kind enough and given me wealth. But that does not mean that I get proud and turn cruel. Even I was born like your husband Deepak. God gave him a taxi for his living and me ajewelry shop. Sir, you've very noble thoughts, that's why God is happy with you. That is nice. You have said a very sweet thing. Do you know why I am here? You surely have a reason... ...or else... Deepak, you don't interfere. This is not your matter. Child, accept this from me. Deepak, I know the reason for your surprise. This is a necklace from your house. Your wife's brother had come to my shop to sell it. I understood that your financial position is not very good. Or else no one sells or mortgages ones own jewelry. Your brotherinlaw also said that you are very strict. And he had to sell the necklace for your medicine. This is the reason I came here. Sir... Deepak, if you had come to me... Till now we thought there was no one to help us in our bad times. We are lucky to have support of a generous man like you. You should praise the Lord who made everyone. Here, child. Take this necklace. Okay, Deepak, now I am leaving. Get your whole family to my place someday. Yes, sure. Krishna, Laxmi, I'll leave. Don't be scared Ramu, just answer my question. Do you've a problem here? Do I deprive you of something? Brother... Look at me when I am talking to you. With lots of hard work, l have made a decent living. Just like a bird who flies the whole day... ...gather's every straw and makes his nest. I request you that if you cannot do anything else... ...then atleast don't ruin my decent livelihood. Why are you talking so politely with him? What else can I do? He is a young boy... ...if I talk strictly, he will back answer me. He will back answer you? I will rip of his tongue! Talk slowly, these matters should stay inside the house. He is a kid, he will understand. Go get me my cap and batch. I have to go for work. He hasn't committed a theft, he has insulted our late parents. No one's a thief in our family. God knows what company he keeps. Why are you crying like a child. He will grow up. It is good that he was caught during his first theft. He will never go on the path again. God has given us hands to do good deeds and not bad. That hands with which you eat, are not used to steal. Always remember... ...learning after falling from the first step... ...saves you from the pain of falling from the top. It is surprising you are a good lawyer at such a young age. If I became a lawyer later, you would've got an old soninlaw. Mr. Gorakh, have you ever fought a murder case? I mean yes. Bobby Kennedy murder case had come to me. But the American atmosphere does not suit me. I had got another murder case too... ...but I cannot digest the rich food people In Punjab eat. I am used to eating plain food. And I am also a simple lawyer. He is Mangludada. His brother Somu has committed a murder. So for his lawsuit, l have recommended your name. My... That was very nice of you. Mr. Balusingh, the lawyer seems to be very young. Yes, a little... He is young, but very intelligent. Mangludada, give him the case and forget about your brother. You keep quiet. Mangludada, you explain everything... ...about the case to Mr. Gorakh. It is not a long story. Someone called my brother, Loafer.' So my brother killed him. That's it! He killed him just for that. Is it your family profession to commit murder? My fore fathers must have committed just 24 murders... ...but my brother must have committed around 510 murders. They are not much. Can you tell more about yourself? What? Can you tell... He means can you tell more about yourself? Yes. My profession is to commit robberies. Once I was caught for a robbery. A good lawyer tried to defend me... ...but he couldn't save me. I returned after 2 yrs. Sentence. And I murdered him. Otherwise his record is clean. Till now it is. But I think he's going to kill one more lawyer. That is good. We will give even that case to you. If I am alive till then. Mangludada, was the murder committed at night? No, in broad daylight. In a market place. Market place? Whose knife was it. The dead person's. Even the knife was his? Don't you use anything of your own? We use just our hands. Mr. Gorakh, his brother has done me many favors. When I was working in the jungle, a lion attacked me... ...but his brother risked his life and saved my life. If it was me, I would Mr. Balusingh(bear)... ...I am fond of a bear and lion fight since childhood. Mangludada, what fees will you give me to fight your case? Fees? Yes. Once a lawyer had asked me to pay his fees... ...then I had broken his legs. Who asked you to pay fees? I was just joking. Have dinner at my place on the day of the hearing. I'll leave. Yes, please. Goodbye Mr. Balusingh. Goodbye. Mr. Balusingh, please come here. Do you really want me to fight this case? It is a surprise, l want it will all my heart. All you heart? Then I will go tell my last wish to my family. What happened? Lawyer! Coming, just a minute. Hurry up, it's getting late. Laxmi! Did you call me brother? Yes. We... Why are you staring at me? I have worn these clothes because... ...I am going for an engagement of friends sister. Take care of the house, okay? I have told the neighbour, she will be with you till we return. That aunty will bore me to death with her talks. Get bored but, you better sit with her. Where are you going Deepak? For someone's engagement. Come, I'll drop you in my taxi. Mind your own business. We will go by ourselves. Come. So this means that Laxmi is alone at home. Tell me, are you going on a leave for some days? Yes. It's been long since I went home. I'll go on leave for a few days. Yes, surely go. Afterall you an only son of your parents. They must be anxious to meet you. Go on. Deepak, you know that l have a son who is a doctor? He is in charge of a Nursing Home in Bangalore. I'm hearing about him today. I've decided to get him married. That's very nice. Appoint me for the work that needs to be done. That's why I've called you. I'm proud you thought of me. This will be the first marriage in this house. It should be very grand. The stage decorated with flowers should be huge. You should have a variety of dance and music. It should be a wedding that no one will ever forget. It will be like that. I forgot to ask you one thing. Will the girl's family be of your league? Yes Deepak, the girl is from a very decent family. They have selfrespect, selfesteem, and everything. They just don't have any wealth. But there is no shortage here. The girl's name is Laxmi. Laxmi! This is also your sister's name. Yes. Then listen, that Laxmi will be my daughterinlaw. I don't understand. What is there to understand? A relationship between a hut and a palace? It has never happened sir. Now it will happen. People will laugh at you sir. That is good. I will give this unhappy world a chance to laugh. Sir, I am in a fix. Deepak, don't refuse. How can I dare. But first let me ask my wife too. How can I give you my word without asking her? Surely ask. How can that noble woman refuse? Okay sir, I'll leave. Why are your hands shivering? You didn't ask anything from me, I did. I am the one asking. Go on, be proud. Walk with pride. So for my only son you have found a taxi driver's sister? Thank God, that we have just one son. If we had 2, I did get 1 married to the sister of a taxi driver... ...and the other to the sister of a cart man. Enough. Stop joking. Shankar got proposals of daughters of landlords... ...judges and ministers, and you found a taxi driver? Listen. If I get a daughter of a landlord, judge or a minister... ...then she'll get along family arrogance too in her dowry. If I get a girl from a poor family... ...she will care for us all her life. We want a beautiful life partner for Shankar... ...and an innocent daughterinlaw. Not a woman having family arrogance. But think, their pair won't match. I don't understand this nonsense. Go in and weigh yourself. Once you see your daughterinlaw... ...your soul along with your body will become lighter. Go, Go on. Where did everyone go? First they used to listen to my voice and come running like... ...chicks do when they hear the hen. Did you call me brother? Yes, I was. I called for you so much but no one is listening. What are you pale. Are you sick? I am not sick, but I have to manage all the household chores. What does your sisterinlaw do? Just orders you around? Doesn't she work? She is not feeling well. What happened to her? How would I know? From the past few days she is feeling nauseous. She goes to the kitchen and eats pickle. Eats pickle? Oh! Now I understood her illness. Where is she? What is it? Why are you twisting my ear? Leave me. How can I? Come here. What has happened? Come with me. She is my wife. My partner is happiness and sorrow. She will keep telling me all kinds of stories. But she is not telling me the most important thing. Now tell me am I not entitled to half the share of her happiness? What are you doing? Talking like that in front of God. O Lord, you are so kind. First you gave me such a good wife. And now she is going to give me a bundle ofjoy. I promise that when my first kid is born... ...l'll come to Dwarka with my family to worship you. And I will name my child after you. Like... You are the first dream in my eyes A colorful and innocent dream I will swing you in the lap of my love I will sing you a lullaby I count every second for that moment... ...for which every mother lives I can listen to you always... ...like music playing somewhere afar Krishna, you cannot even imagine who got a proposal for Laxmi. Don't try my patience. Tell me who is it. Come sit down. Do you know Mr. Shyamlal? Yes. He himself asked for Laxmi's hand in marriage. His, son! Yes, his name is Shankar. He is also a doctor. Doctor! Oh God, you have... Are you telling the truth? Do you think I am lying? What are you that you don't trust me? I am so happy that I couldn't believe. I'll give Laxmi this news. No. Come sit here. Let's make all the arrangements for the engagement first... ...then we will tell Laxmi. What is the wedding date? Wasn't this a stupid question? Would I have fixed the date without asking you? Fist of all I have to ask you if you like this proposal or not? I asked a stupid question... ...but even you didn't say something intelligent. Can our thoughts be different? Won't I want Laxmi to go in a nice family. And spend her life with peace and happiness. Neither were my parents selfish, nor is my husband selfish... ...then how can I be? It's not that, I thought that maybe you are thinking... ...of getting Laxmi married to Ramu. What are you saying? Ramu is my brother, but I know what he is. Will I get Laxmi married to Ramu? Never. Never! What's the matter Gorakh,? You look tired early in the morning. I was working all night. Were you exercising? No, I was not exercising. I was trying to get points... ...Mangludada's brother Somudada's case. Did you get any point? I will have to. I can tell you the judge's verdict now itself. Are you Somu's lawyer or a public prosecutor? If that happens then Manglu will kill you. Doesn't matter. There will be one more case. Manglu will be hanged for killing me. Then we will get married and live happily ever after. But you would be dead. Oh yes, I forgot about this point. Darling, you didn't give Manglu my home address, right? Not yet. Very good. And don't even give it to him. What's the matter? Why are you scared? I am not scared of Manglu. I am just scared of court. You are a lawyer and you are scared of court! My law is limited to this black coat. I am not a lawyer. So did you lie to me? You had said that your father wants you to marry a lawyer. Don't be upset darling. Let me go. Don't tell your father. Tell me something. Why are you quiet, tell me. Okay, I'll tell you first count to 3. Count to 3? Is this a classroom? Say it. Okay. Now you boss over me. Here. One... Two... Three... You stopped me at three! Oh! It's your third month? That means there are 67 months more to go? After 6 months I will have a tiny baby in my hands. Talk slowly, why are you going mad with happiness? Why talk slowly? I'll be a Why should I bother? Hey, give it to me. Give me that too. Shankar, come here son. You know why I have called you here? Father, you had written everything in the letter. If you have anything on your mind, say it. Father, I am not like those children... ...who doubt their parents decision. Didn't mother oppose it? She wanted you to have a bride... ...who has a huge family background. But I made her understand. Today the girl's family is coming here. See the girl, if possible we'll get you engaged today itself. As you say father. What's wrong with sir, after all Deepak is a taxi driver. You are right, but... you can live without having money... ...can't Deepak live after having money? Yes, he can. What? Yes, he can. What? Yes, he can! Please come. You wait here. Please come. Welcome! The guests are here. You have come Deepak? Come. Please come. Come, why are you shy? This is Krishna, and this is Laxmi. Greetings! Okay, I'll leave now. Okay, you should leave. Okay bye everyone. Shankar, he is Deepak. Greetings! Greetings! Father has told me a lot about you. Good people hide other people's faults too. Shankar, she is Deepak's wife. Greetings! And she is Laxmi. Come. Come child. Shankar, do you want to say anything? No father. I understood the meaning of your smile. Deepak, tell me do you all agree to this alliance? There is no question of refusing. So Laxmi is now ours. Deepak, why are you sitting so far... ...both of us are related, come closer. Brother had said that we are going for a party... But here they are talking of my marriage. Why are you frowning? You should be happy. No sisterinlaw, I don't like it. Come, let's go home. Why go home? Now we have to talk about the engagement. Come here. Take their blessings. Come on, get up. Why are you shy? Take their blessings. Get up. Bless you child. You were Bless you. She is a very nice girl. Shankar. Yes father. Arrange for some tea. Yes father. What happened to you? What happened to her? What happened? Shankar, take a look. Sometimes you faint out ofjoy. Shankar, why did she faint? Father... Tell us, what is it? Tell us son. I am a doctor, so I can't hide the problem. This girl is pregnant. What did you say? Your sister is 2 months pregnant. No! Don't say that. Check her again, you must be mistaken. Please don't doubt that... ...or else someone will be ruined. Yes son, check again. A mistake can ruin the girls' life. If I'd kept it a secret, it would've ruined many other lives. Whatever I said is the truth. And I have had to say it with great regret. Father, don't forget that I am a doctor. Doctor, if you don't like Laxmi... ...then why are you giving such a vile reason to refuse. I am a poor man. My wealth is my honour and my decency. I beg of you not to accuse her of this. Add some poison to it. You are saying this to me? Whom can I trust? You had told me that young girls are unpredictable... ...we could not take care of her. Laxmi was a chaste woman, how could she do this? Why are you quiet? Who is responsible for all this? Tell me! Speak up, or else I will go mad. How can I answer that? You're the woman of this house, who else do I ask if not you? Answer me, why did Laxmi do this to me. Krishna, say something. I will tell you. Listen with patience. Hurry up, and tell me. Today when I was returning from the market... ...I saw 2 kids were acting like their parents. Standing next to them was their maid watching them. I scolded the kids, and told them not to play such a game. The maid told me, why do you scold them... ' ...scold their parents... ' ...who do such acts in the children's presence.' Children are impressionable. They get influenced by both good and bad. Then what is the children's fault? Now tell me what answer do you have for this? Oh God! Are we responsible... ...for Laxmi's sin? But what is our fault? We are poor. Where do we get a big house from? We have to make do with just one room. We have to love our wife here, and take care of the kids also. Krishna, you have hurt me by saying this. I will die Krishna. I cannot tolerate this. My younger sister... Brother... Laxmi, now how could you dare to face me? I had so many dreams for you. I'd thought you will be married in a nice family one day. A rich man's son will come here with a marriage procession... ...and I with my head held high with pride would have said... ...my sister is going in such a rich family. But Laxmi, you have ruined my dreams. Tell me, why did you do this? With whom did you do it? Tell me Laxmi, who did this to you? What will she say? You tell me. Say something. What do I say? If I knew who it was, you would have his deadbody before you. Sisterinlaw. Why are you at her feet? You have betrayed me. Tell me, who he is. You have committed a sin... ...now don't commit another by hiding him from your brother. Tell us, who is he. So someone from this house is responsible for this! Are you telling the truth? Is Ramu responsible for ruining your life? Your brother has earned this sin? I would even dream that Ramu... ...that Ramu will turn out to be my enemy. Ramu, I never thought of you as my wife's brother. I thought of you as my own brother. Did you have to repay me like this for my love? I used to consider myself the most happy man in the world. But you ruined my happiness, peace of mind, everything. Look at her... Earlier she had an aura of a chaste woman... ...which has now been tarnished. Earlier she was like a free bird... ...and now she has been put into a cage. Speak up. Why are you quiet? Do you think that your silence will cover up your sin? Admit it yourself. Do you admit it or not? Where did he go? Today, I will kill him. I won't spare him! Poor boy, got run over! What happened? It was a young boy, he was covered in blood. So the man took him in his car. Brother, what happened? Speak up brother. At him. Brother, what happened? Here, have atleast one more. Darling, do you know what was it called in the Mogul period? What do I know about those times? I'm not from that period. It was called Sobosa' in the Mogul language. Understood? Now you say that. Okay, take Sobosa.' Can I take what I want? No. What is this? Give me one. After marriage. Who knows when we get married, atleast let's rehearse it once. Come here No not now Your refusal is as good as your agreement What's the hurry, if not now then when Go on, torture me, make me suffer Tell me how long am I to stay thirsty standing by the shore We have all the time, what's the hurry If not now then someother time Let our eyes meet, let us fall in love May we be patient, let our love mature Think before falling in love Why admit to false love When hearts meet Words don't matter Are you listening? Shankar is going back today. What are you staring? I hadn't decided to get him married. Will you ever let me live in peace? Have I made life difficult for you? Mother, why do you unnecessarily fight? We are not fighting, I am just making him understand... ...that why is he unnecessarily loosing his sleep? It is Deepak's problem Father, forget about it. Son, I am never scared of trying anything. But why did a noble man like Deepak have to face this? Is said that even God tests good men. Like you test gold, God tests good men. Very good. You said a nice thing. Tell me is it necessary for you to go today? Yes father. Okay. Earlier the happiness felt when you came... ...today includes a slight pain. Are you going by car? Yes. Go on. Drive carefully. Bless you. What happened? Laxmi left the house. She left this letter. I said, Laxmi left the house. Why are you quiet? Go inside. Did you hear what I said? I said, go inside! What will I do inside? The soul of our house is gone. Whom do I talk to? Whom do I hug? It would be better if I die too. Laxmi, you left your brother? Ramu... Ramu... I will kill Ramu! What happened Krishna? No. I was scared. Krishna, you don't have to be scared when I am with you. Forget what has happened. Here, take this. Keep this here. You don't get nightmares if you keep iron next to you. Come. Go to sleep. How is that girl? If we had her address, we would have informed her family. I know her address. But no need to inform them right now. One more thing. Is the girl married? No. Then how did she have an abortion due to the shock? Yes. Doctor, take special care of this girl. What a difference! Look at the difference between a saint like Deepak and his sister. She had an affair with Deepak's brotherinlaw. Mind your tongue. Deepak is like a brother to us. I didn't say that he is my enemy. If he had gotten his sister married to me... ...then he wouldn't have been defamed today. What's the matter aunty? Why did you call me? It's time for her delivery. Go and admit her in a hospital. I won't go to the hospital. Why are you scared? I have come, I'll be with you. Come on, get up. What did you say. Krishna died! Oh God! You are the first dream in my eyes A colorful and innocent dream I will swing you in I will sing you a lullaby The garden is destroyed, a bud remains A shrunken memory remains in my heart Don't sing a lullaby crying If you cry, how will he stop crying God, I had promised that my family to worship you. How do I come? Tell me O God, how did this happen? Shamli, is the old man, your father in? No. Come in. Tell me Shamli, are you fine? No. Do you know Mangludada's brother was hanged. The murderer had to be hanged. Mangludada had come here. He is after your life. One day, even he will be hanged. Is you father upset with me? Do you think he will be pleased with you? He has come to know that you are not a lawyer. Oh God! And Mangludada has threatened father... ...that within a week if he does not hand you over to him... ...then he will make it difficult for us to stay here. Let him be damned! It's good you walked into the trap. Gorakh, I was looking for you all over the place. Bulbulsingh. It's Balusing. Yes. Bulbulsingh. Balusingh. Yes Mr. Balusingh, I am a foreteller. I understood your problem are upset with me. But if you remain upset with me... ...your daughter will remain a spinster. Let her be. First tell m why did you need to act like a lawyer? Because of you, Manglu has become my enemy. Mr. Bulbulsingh... Balusingh! Yes Balusingh... ...the man who is an enemy of the government and the public... ...can't he be your enemy? In the law... Don't talk about law, or I'll beat you up. Becoming Manglu's enemy is like losing your life. Understood? If anyone raises his finger at you, I'll kill him. You'll be happy to know that for 7 years our problem is solved. You will live for 7 years and even I will live for 7 years. Famous dacoit Mangludada, is sentenced for 7 yrs... ...imprisonment for 3 robberies. After 7 years when he comes back... ...l'll have 6 children playing in Shamli's lap. Really? Now you agree to being my fatherinlaw? Go wash your face. Okay. Shamli, where is the bathroom? Forget that & listen to me, you are not at all worthy of Shamli. Don't say that father. If not a lawyer, he is a rich man's son. So what? Cool down. Look, it's just a matter of 2 days. Don't get angry. Think with a cool head... ...think and then tell me. I will do as you say. Now, I'll leave. I have to meet someone. Go on. He himself went off. Pack your clothes, we'll elope from here. Hurry up. He is a nice old man. Go on. Do you hear about Deepak? I looked for him at many places. No one knows about him. Poor Deepak. If he doesn't work, then how will he bring up his kid? You have done so much for me. I swear, I'll take manage your responsibilities all my life. Don't call me sir. I was an ordinary wandering youth. I was luck that I came under his car. And that accident got me to a new turn in life. Doctor, In Mr. Rai's memory... ...I give this cheque of Rs. 50,000... ...for the improvement of the nursing home. Yes? Next week it's his birthday. It should be celebrated like it was celebrated when he was alive. Give the staff of the transport company & nursing home staff... ...a 3 months bonus. Thank you sir. Now stop taking this staff's support. You are absolutely fine. Where were you going without my permission? A dying person does not need any permission. Don't talk nonsense. You don't get life again and again. What you call life is worse than death. You know that. Laxmi, like you repeatedly wish to die... ...if you wish to live... ...you will see that life is so beautiful. Look the end of my sorrows will be when I die. There is no use making me understand. You should have let me die that day. I am a doctor. It's my job to save people's lives. But by saving me you did not do me a favour. I beg you not to make me suffer like this. Laxmi, why do you lose hope? Who knows how much happiness is lying in wait for you? No, it's all a lie. They are dreams. Dreams never come true. Laxmi. Let me die doctor. There's no one in this world for me. I don't belong to anyone. She has fainted again. Lie her on the bed. One person should be with her 24 hours. What's the matter Mr. Ram? Was it a new case? The case is 2 years old. But is very complicated. Forgive me for interfering. You attend to the patient. Is this a hotel? Darling, this is a nursing home. Will you keep me in a nursing home after getting me from home? What is the difference between a hotel and a nursing home? Food is delivered in a hotel, here kids are delivered. You get a bed to sleep both in a hotel and a nursing home. Hotels have boys for service and here there are nurses. We'll have to do one thing. Till we don't get another option... ...you act dumb. Mother and father are fine, right? Yes, brotherinlaw has better moustache... ...and sister is losing weight. Did you come here for some work? Yes something important. Girl was with me in college. She used to talk so much. One day she suddenly stopped talking. She became dumb. What's her name? Her name is Shamli. Doesn't she speak at all? You test her. Show me your tongue. What's your father's name? Nephew, listen to me. Her whole family's name is Baa, Baa.' When did she become dumb? Around 4 years, 9 months... ...5 days, and... what time is it now? 5 o'clock. Yes... and 5 hours. So did she talk before that? Yes, she talked so much that her society had noise pollution. In the college days, she was the only girl... ...who gave a lecture to 2000 students without a loudspeaker. The cure for loneliness is not a walk in the park. At this age you need a life partner. You're right doctor. But before marriage I have a duty to fulfill. I have to look for someone. What kind of a duty is that? I'll tell you some other time. Can I ask you something? Sure. You are elder to me. Then why haven't you cured your loneliness till now? I had got a chance. Then what happened? But I lost it. Why is that? Father had fixed my marriage to someone. But that girl... You didn't like her? No. It was something else. Did she have a flaw? A person does not have flaws... It's the situation that gives him flaws. Anyway, forget all this. We are getting late. Whose kid is he? I cannot see anyone around. Sunder, come here. Yes sir. Look, this kid is lost. You stay with him. If someone comes looking for him, then hand him over. Okay. Or else take him to the police. Okay. I will drive the car myself. Come. Pick him up. If he cries get him some sweets. Okay. Mohan! I was so scared. Sunder, it's you! Deepak, you are here? Is he your son? Yes. I went off to sleep so he walked away. Maybe that is how we were destined to meet. Tell me Deepak, how did you come to this city? What have you done to yourself? What do I say Sunder? My life seems worthless now. It is slipping out of my hands. Didn't you know I was here? You should have looked for me. When troubled, a person forgets himself... ...how could I think of you? But when did you get married? You didn't even invite me. Where is sisterinlaw? I have just this left of your sisterinlaw. I understand. It is all fate. Come to my house with me. I don't want to be a burden. Deepak, don't insult friendship. You have helped others all your life... ...what I am getting today is all because of you. Come with me. Come on. Come Deepak. Why are you so astonished? You must be thinking how a driver got such a big house. It is all our master's generosity. He gives every employee a house to live for free. Your master must be a very big man. He is very young, but has a huge heart. Just wait a minute. Deepak, why are you so lost? She is my only sister. Really! Radha, do you know he the same Deepak... ...with whose help we are surviving today. Then today we are lucky to have him. Greetings. What are you waiting for? Take the child. Yes brother. Come. Didn't you get his mother? No, there is just him. What about the mother? I will tell you later. First give him some food, and give the child some milk. Okay. Listen, Give him to me. Why? Can't I play with him? What's his name? Just like the little Lord. Right? Sir, a letter which you had addressed to Mr. Deepak... ...has come back. Come back? It's possible that the address is wrong. How can that be? It is also possible that the person you wrote the letter to... ...lives somewhere else or left the town. The food is you eat and not look at. I will eat. Don't consider Radha a novice. The food she makes is delicious. Brother why are you making fun of me? To satisfy himself a poor man considers water as juice... ...and rice as pulao. Munna is crying. You sit. I will take care of him. Did you see, he stopped crying. He has become close to Radha. Can I ask you something Sunder? Why haven't you married yet? I haven't grown old. You are not even young. You are right, but having a younger sister... ...if I get married. It does not seem right. Just think, when my wife comes home... ...I will give her more attention than to Radha. How will I freely talk to my wife in front of my sister? You are right Sunder. Don't get married now. Who is it? Manager? It is Shankar from Bangalore. Call father? What? He has gone on a pilgrimage? Okay. When he return, ask him to give me a call. It is something very important. Okay. Did you find out something? Nothing doctor. I think that even Deepak is not in Mumbai. Manager. He is my friend Deepak. Deepak he is our Manager. Greetings sir! Greetings! Manger, he has been my friend since long. He is a very good driver. I would say that he is both, honest and a good driver. But he is unemployed nowadays. If you would be kind enough to give ajob, he'll be grateful. Sunder, job come up often over here. Why don't you yourself go to the master. He should agree for it. Then I will give him ajob. Manager, as you say. But if you came along... ...then it would be helpful. Okay, I'll come along too. What is it? Sir, Sunder wants to ask you something. What is it Sunder? Sir, my friend needs ajob of a driver. That friend has done me many favors. If you give him ajob in your company. I'll be very grateful. But as far as I can remember, a new driver is not required. Sir, I would be grateful. He has seen good days. At one time he used to get people like us, employed. His life changed. His family and everything is ruined. He is roaming around unemployed with a small kid. What kind of a man is he? It will be justified if you think of him as God. Yes? When an honest man like Sunder is praising him so much... ...then he is surely worthy of sympathy. Employ him anywhere. As you say sir. Sir, shall I call him in? No, it's not required. Listen! What? Let out the smoke on that side. The tobacco's stench is getting to me. Shamli, you smoke tobacco in the pipe and not any perfume. Now tell me how long do we have to stay in this hell? Till we are not invited to heaven. No. I won't stay here a minute. Afterall what's the problem. We have a room, food for free. And also romance for free. And even you ogle at the nurses for free. If you get arrested for something, then where will I go? Shamli, sometimes you say stupid things like your father. I won't let go of an angel like you and choose them. I am not that bad that I leave you and run away with a nurse. Then why do you peep around all day? Silly girl. These nurses are also women... ...if I don't look at them once in a day, they'll get a complex. I don't know. I feel trapped here. If you had elope you should have first looked for a place. The doctor is coming. Uncle. What's going on? I'm clearing her throat with the pipe. Don't you know smoking is not allowed in the nursing home? Uncle. Throw the pipe. I'll arrange for your operation. I can talk. I can talk so loudly that your ear drums will burst. Your patients will run away from the nursing home. Uncle, where have you got this trouble from? She is going on nonstop! She sometimes talks and sometimes get's stuck. Doctor, your uncle is fooling you. I am not dumb and I never was. If you don't believe me, I'll tell you a dialogue. A lion cub never eats grass.' If you didn't see the play then what did you see.' The doe left but not the memory of the doe like eyes.' If you don't believe my dialogue then I will sing a song... In your memory, Beloved... Now tell me uncle. Operate on him, he is dumb. Make then empty the room today itself. Yes sure. Now please keep quiet. Why are you crying? I got this job with great difficulty. It's my 1st day. Let me go. Come on, keep quiet. What happened to him? He never cries like this. What happened? What happened. Daddy hit you? Doesn't matter. We will twist his ear. Right? Mother! Look, he called me mother. One thinks of things that he has lost. You go to work. Today is the first day to work. Today is his birthday too. It's your birthday today? And it is your first day to work. It's a lucky day, right? Were you crying because no one is celebrating your birthday? I am here to celebrate your birthday. Come. Your father is very lazy. He didn't even make his bed. My photograph! It's me. Munna's mother.' God gives everyone different fates.' But by mistake, he gave us same faces.' Radha, I am grateful to you' You are giving my Mohan a mother's love.' Will you do me a favour, as a younger sister. Will you? ' The place I hold in my Deepak's heart... ' ...you take that place.' Even you put a bindi like I have in the photograph.' Shankar! Mother! Father! What a surprise. Forget all that. First tell me, is everything fine? Everything is fine. But when did you return from the pilgrimage? When you saw us. Why did you think of going on a pilgrimage? Son, from quite a few days, I was not at peace... I was bored of seeing your mother everyday. I thought why not go for a pilgrimage. It's good, atleast his sins have been forgiven. Your, not mine. I have done good deeds all my life. I had come to tell you that Laxmi's temperature is normal. Son, who is Laxmi? The same one. Deepak's sister. I am treating her in my nursing home. But how did Laxmi come to your nursing home? When I was coming to Bangalore. Laxmi tried to commit suicide... ...by jumping in the river. I saved her with great difficulty. Shankar, are doctor also stupid. If people come to know, they will talk so much. Why did you need to get Laxmi here? If she wanted to die, you should have let her. Shankar, I didn't expect this from you. What's the use of saving a girl... ...who ruined her poor brother's life? Your mother is right. People will unnecessarily talk about us son. Father, i didn't expect you to agree with mother. One who has a clear mind does not see faults... ...he sees the good qualities. You educated me and made me a doctor... ...and now you expect me to let someone drown in front of me? We should fear the society, but not kill our conscience. Even he is right. Even you are strange. You keep changing! Look, don't criticize my son. A short bridegroom, A fat bride You are light and weightless, she is plump and pudgy If she sleeps on Monday, she wakes up on Friday Tomorrow is Sunday, Munna will go to the market She eats so much Even then the bride remains hungry out of shyness 80 meter skirt is tight for the poor girl She took him in her lap when she felt affectionate A little darling sing and plays in my veranda She dances, sings and kisses her Munna He will but a 2 paise bride and a 6 paise necklace Why have you put bindi like that today? Doesn't it look good on my forehead? Don't mind. I just asked. Why have you created such an ado for his birthday? Because a birthday is to celebrate happiness. Come children. Please give your cigarette, I want to light the pipe. Forgive me. God knows why I got such a useless man! Now will we sleep on the footpath? Okay, let's have an open air romance for somedays. Yes, why? Remember that. Come, let's go tell the doctor. Nephew, we found Deepak. Deepak? Where is he? He is in this city. He was driving a taxi. Yes. Driving a taxi? The taxi had a company name written on it. What was it? That is our company name. It is Doctor Shankar speaking. Is there a driver named Deepak over there? Yes, there is. What is the matter? He's my friend. When he returns from duty ask him to call me. A Rs. 100 bill? Excuse me sir. Did you keep all the gold? The police is chasing us. Listen! What is it? You are smugglers? That is why you asked me to drive fast? Mind your business. Police station? What did you say? Deepak, one of our drivers met with an accident. Sunder. What is it Raju? Deepak met with an accident. Where is Deepak? Don't worry. Deepak was not hurt. Come with me. Manager... You are here? Yes. According to me you should have been in the hospital. You thought right, but God saved me. It was a very bad accident, I just escaped. You were saved, but the taxi was not. I didn't think that I will meet with an accident so suddenly. Who were they? They were smugglers. They were smuggling gold. I came to know at the last moment. Why did you need to bother with them? According to me it was the duty of a taxi driver. What argument is going on? Sir the thing is that... Sir... Today was the first day of a new taxi and I met with an accident. Brother! Brother, what are you looking at? I am your Ramu. No, you are the one to ruin my whole family. No brother. Don't say that. You call me brother after ruining my happy family? I thought you have been punished for your sin. That you were run over by a car. But you are alive! Why did God keep you alive. Brother, don't get me wrong. I am not alive, day and night... ...all the time... ...I regret what I did and am suffering. You should seriously have died till now. You are standing before me as my boss... ...if I knew that you are the head of this company... ...then I would not have made the mistake of working here. I am not the master of this company... ...I am the keeper of someone's property. I tried to find you... ...to beg you for forgiveness. I repent the injustice I did to Laxmi. Don't try to convince me with your lies. You never get your honour back. You had defamed me, I am still looked down on in society. I can still not look people in their eyes. Brother believe me, I will repent every sin I committed. Now I am not the old Ramu anymore... ...I have understood the ways of the world. Brother kill me yourself. But don't doubt me. Brother! Yes brother. Am I dreaming? It's you! Mr. Deepak, she was going to commit suicide. I was passing by. I saved her. From then she is in my nursing home under my treatment. Has everyone in your family decided to do me favors? Deepak, people part in the bad days. ...and meet in the good days. Sir, I was unfair to Laxmi without thinking. I wiped off her happiness. Laxmi, elders have to forgive the mistakes children make. I am happy that you are standing alive before me. Ramu, forget the past. Tell me, will you accept Laxmi? If I don't, then there won't a worse sinner in the whole world. Silly girl, why are you crying? Your days to smile are here. Now even Krishna must be happy. If you were here, these 2 would have wiped your tears. You would have been so happy. Brother, you didn't get sisterinlaw? Yes brother, where is sister? Munna was crying at home and you are here? Sisterinlaw? Sister. Why are you touching my feet? This is where we belong, sisterinlaw. Forgive me sister. I am not what I used to be. Who are these people? Laxmi, she is not your sisterinlaw. What are you saying? She's Radha, sister of my friend. They helped me in my bad days. I live with them. Then where is sister? Tell us. If you want to see Krishna, look at that kid. ...he is her last memento. Every Indian woman wants her last rites... ...to be performed by her husband. In the same way my Krishna... ...in front of my eyes... ...went very far to a place... ...where one day everyone goes. Kids, the love you had for Krishna... ...treasure it in your heart. Don't let it flow away through your tears. Your marriage. Bless you. Today, I completed my duty. I won't give him to you. Now I cannot live without him. She is telling the truth. Munna is your son... ...but even Radha has some right over him. Sir... Look, that child is asking something from you. I know that you are a young man. Some one who will help others what may come. Sometimes you have to do something for yourself too. He is right. Life is a difficult journey. This journey cannot be passed with sad memories. At some point or the other one has to make compromises. You are saying that Sunder? Look Deepak, children are divine. Maybe, this is God's hint. Nowadays the rumor is that she has married me. So I thought today I will get married to her. So my sister won't have to carry so much weight... ...in my marriage procession. Pandit, please chant some mantra for us too. We got the garland. Darling, put the garland. Just a minute. There are so many couples here. When will Shankar get married? Uncle, I haven; t grown old. I can wait for a year or two. So that means that you and Munna will get married together.
