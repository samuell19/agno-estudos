Who the hell is this judge? It's been an hour already. Come in. I am not nudging, but... Anything else? Anything else other than "I'm not nudging"? The Court schedule is pretty full today... The cases are piling up. Other judges will again have to pick up your cases. How is that my problem? It's just that... Christina won't be impressed... Right, Christina, your new leader. How about if I am not impressed? Is that important? Of course it is. Of course it is... ...so why the long face? Death in the family? No, Sir. Then you should be thankful. And also be thankful for Christina. She's a modern day Dr Faustus. What did she have to give in exchange for this promotion? Wait. Maybe you can sacrifice a lamb to the Gods? Make it a few lambs. Only lambs can give someone like Christina a promotion. Court! You've been charged with using obscene language... ...in-an MTR premises at 4:30pm on 8th March of this year. How do you intend to plead to this charge? Not guilty. I suppose so... Mr. Wong, are you going to make your plea properly? Your lack of enthusiasm disturbs me. Are you suffering from hunger? Or are you dissatisfied with the legal system? I don't know what you're talking about! That guy has driven me to absolute despair! And now he is working with the MTR to set me up. I'd rather die than plead guilty! The MTR is just a mode of transport. A mode of transport is incapable of conspiring with a human to incriminate you. At least, with our current technology, a train is incapable of that. And pleading not guilty has nothing to do with death Case adjourned. No previous of fence, your Honour. Plea bargain? Plea bargain? Case adjourned. You've been charged with theft at a convenience store at 66 Tsun Yip Street, Kwun Tong at 7pm, on 27th April this year. You unlawfully took two microwave meals, valued at $28. How do you intend to plead to this charge? Guilty, your Honour. Guilty as charged. There's a previous record of a similar nature. Plea bargain? My boss vanished. I did the work but never got paid. I can go without food. But I can't let that happen to my parents. That's your justification? Are you emotionally blackmailing me? You think your parents can't go without food, but the shopkeeper can go without food? If being poor allows you to do whatever you want, we might as well let you burn the world down. Order for compensation for the amount of $28, your Honour. It says $6 on the box, it's discounted. It's clearly $14. Yes, I picked boxes that were discounted. Why did you agree that you stole $28's worth of food? These microwave meals were not $28! It's clearly $12. And you are asking for a $28 compensation? Be fair. The compensation order is $12. Plus a fine for the crime of $600. Pay it within six months. (New Posting at The Obscene Articles Tribunal) (God has forsaken us.) You were always picking fights with Christina. Everyone at the Magistrate knows she holds a grudge. Now that she is your boss. It's payback time. Imagine if she transfered you to the Censorship Tribunal. And you will be looking at tits, bums, and corpses all day, every day. Doesn't that sound fun? Join my law firm. Make a bit of cash before you retire. The tycoons are always looking for barrister friends. When they are in trouble with the Law, we become their best friends. In return, they give us a bit of insider info here and there. And we make a few easy dollars; win-win, no? What are you worried about? My firm has an office waiting for you. A GUILTY CONSCIENCE Child neglect. Here, your first client, and easy on the eye too. That's what I call friendship. Jolene Tsang. Single mother. Retired Top Model. Quit seven years ago after having a child. Her daughter is the one who's in hospital. Still in a coma. Not out of the ICU yet. A child abuse trial should be straightforward enough. See it as a warm-up? You over there, don't overdo it. What if it comes tumbling down? There are glassware pieces in one of the boxes. Taking an extra trip isn't that much of an ask, is it? I moved the box with the glassware in it first. It's safe at the bottom of the pile. These three boxes are lighter than the other two. I am not going to waste my time doing another trip. I have no problem moving your stuff for you. Next time, though, please let me know a night in advance. I will bring a pair of loafers. Evelyn Fong. Adrian Lam. Evelyn. Yes, as in Evelyn Wood, the British Field Marshal. Oh really? Naming a girl after a field marshal, how quaint. Adrian isn't exactly a common name either. Barristers are not supposed to shake hands. A traditionalist, I see. How wonderful. I need to take a call now. Would you excuse me. Fantastic, that's that then. She's all yours. Time for a massage. Take it easy. Child abuse, huh. Walk in the park. Your Honour! It's been a long time! It's been a long time all right. You are looking well. Keeping fit? Cardio is good. Still need to work on muscle strength. Sounds like you are working out hard. TK tells me you are raking it in. Just bits of work here and there. From now on, I am at your service. Your Honour! There's no need for that. Master Adrian! Ms. Tsang. This is Adrian Lam. He and I will represent you. I know you've told it before, but I would like you to tell Mr Lam what happened that night. On that fateful night, my daughter had a bit of a fever. She went to bed earlier than usual. Will the little angel watch over me? Of course she will. That little angel, I spent ages making it. I know. Your mum can't do a better job. And people can see it when they walk in? Of course. The angel is kissing you too. After I put Elsa to sleep, I went to the garden. I passed out. When I woke up, I just found out that I fell asleep for 2 hours. Elsa...! Elsa...! At the Emergency Room, I saw doctors treating Elsa. Not long after that, I was arrested, for child neglect. They said I caused Elsa's injuries. Where was your husband that night? I never got married. We split up before Elsa was born. Apart from you and Elsa, was there anyone else at your home that night? No. Did you hit your girl? No! The doctors have issued a report. It came this morning. Apart from the injury on the back of her head, both of Elsa's arms were slightly bruised. It is implying that, Elsa was pushed towards the table by an adult. It was no accident. Who do you think did that? I don't know. Do you have family? My parents passed away many years ago. And I don't have any family in town. My relatives have all emigrated away. I don't think this is a complicated case. If you do get convicted, it will not be a long sentence. Relax. Court! Members of the Jury, The victim in this case, is a girl named Elsa Tsang, aged 7. On the night of the incident, while on route to the Tseung Kwan O Hospital Elsa was found to be suffering from a brain bleed, and there were also signs of physical abuse. According to the Defendant's testimony... (No Fingerprint Check) Is it time to give it a break? Don't worry about it. This guy is just reading from a script. Just going through the motions. Tell me when it hits $4. The price hasn't moved for a while. Hitting $4.1 is already a cause for celebration. To sum up, both arms of the victim showed signs that she was forcefully grabbed, it's very probable that she was grabbed, then pushed to the ground. Very probable? That means it's possible that it didn't happen? I would say the chance of that is close to zero. Being close to zero isn't zero. I have no further questions. No expert report can ever claim to be 100% certain. Look at him. Some smart people look like Plato. This guy looks like Bluto from Popeye! If he is an expert witness, I am Abraham Lincoln! Enough already! I call Chan Ball. I was patrolling the village that night. I saw Ms. Tsang's lights were on. I also saw her daughter struggling near the glass door. But I couldn't hear her cry. Because she has a speech impediment. That's not what he said in his prior testimony! I did not do that! Really? Chan Ball, why are you saying this? I was drunk, in my garden. Defendent! Your Honour, allow me. Mr. Chan, when you gave evidence to the Police, you didn't say what you've just said. I thought it was just a domestic squabble; nothing serious. There's no mention of this in your testimony to the Police? No, but... Weeks later, you suddenly thought it's something worth mentioning? Are you a licensed security guard? Isn't it the duty of a security guard, to protect the safety... ...of his residents? Yes. And when one of them is in danger, is it not your duty to... ...call the police for help? Yes. Did you call the Police that night? Yes, or no? No, I did not. May I suggest that, on the night of the incident, no one was in danger. You may say it was an oversight. But let me further suggest that, Ms. Tsang did not forcefully drag her daughter into her house. I believe the statement you just gave in court was all made up. Whatever you say then. I have no further questions, Your Honour. Mr. Lam, I do hope you'll pull your socks up soon. The stock rose by $4.8, I assure Mr. Lam is laughing all the way to the bank. Adrian! If it's stocks and shares you're keen on, talk to Marco. For the property market, I am your man. I work with a bunch of international traders. Wilson, international real estate... ...isn't really my thing. It's an honour to meet two friends with such excellent foresight. I have much to learn from you. Cheers! Thank you. Adrian! Yes. Here's a question for you. Do you know the difference between a Court case and a trade? I am all ears. Trading a stock, you win by reason; Arguing a case, you win by rhetoric. Do you really think wealth can be accumulated by rhetoric? Fabulous. Insightful. Very Insightful indeed. Let's party. It's your first time doing this, you may need some help. Try this... This is insane. If it doesn't work properly, you know what to do. Why so quiet? Let's pop some more! I have a bottle of 25 years here. You can't get it anywhere even if you have the money. I am knackered today. What's so important that can't wait until the morning? Evelyn got a call from the hospital. The nurse saw Elsa moving her arms slightly. She may wake up soon. That's why we are here. Had plenty to drink? I was going to talk to you about tomorrow's proceedings. Thought we'd better coordinate a bit better. What's there to coordinate? And you want to use the ICU as a meeting room? I'm thirsty. Did you buy these? Oranges for a girl in a coma? Were you going to drip-feed her orange juice? Elsa is up! Let me get the doctor. Little girl, can you hear us? We can't understand you, we don't know how to sign. But there's no need to be afraid. We are lawyers, Did your mother do this to you? It wasn't your mum. If not, who did? Excuse me, sir, you are not supposed to be here. Please leave now, thank you. The doctor is going to check on the girl now. No need to check! So the girl said it wasn't her mother. Let her mother know, first thing in the morning. When the girl appears in court, we win. Piece of cake, we have won. Do you have a light? Yes, at home. And I expect no more calls from you tonight. What the fuck do you want now? Elsa woke up from her coma last night. But it was just a short rally. However, she signed at us. I want to know what she said. She said: Mum never beat me. I'm afraid we are dealing with a manslaughter case now. We are talking about a possible life sentence here. We know Elsa didn't lie. Tell me, who else was at your home that night? My boyfriend, Dr. Desmond Chung. So it was Desmond Chung's doing? No, no, no. According to the forensic report, at the time of attack, Desmond Chung was at the studio. That's a perfect alibi for him. This case is so juicy, I don't understand why it's not all over the news. When the media wants to talk about the Chung's, they need to get their permission first. That's one powerful family. The Chung's is old money, all the tycoons in town follow their lead. Mrs. Chung's brother was... ...an influential politician. Her brother-in-law was a big shot banker. The Chung's are the Kings and Queens of the jungle, top of the Hong Kong food chain. Master Adrian, now that you have one foot into the Chung's front door, you've hit jackpot! Once I have sorted out this case, my fees will skyrocket! You've got a point. Luck has it that I get to work on this case. You're right, I can be Desmond Chung's lifeline. I will be right in there with the Chung's. I will bite my legs off to get in there. That's a bit radical. Legs are important. Especially my nice legs. Don't show off. Excuse me. Dr.Chung, you said you saw Elsa laying on the floor as soon as you entered the house. Correct? Correct. But I want to be crystal clear here. When you entered the house, does it mean, the door was unlocked at the time? The door was unlocked. I walked straight in. Bingo! We have found the key to this case! An unlocked front door, which means anyone could've been in the house. And there could be other suspects besides Jolene Tsang. You tell the Court about the unlocked front door. And that's a guaranteed win, but your reputation is even more important. I can't speak for other lawyers but, I will look after you in Court. You have my word. Okay. Mr. Tung is here. Uncle Tung. Uncle Tung. Just had dinner with your mum. She is with the bankers now. The papers for the trust fund are ready. Thank you Uncle Tung. Let's hope Franchesca's trust fund will benefit more dogs. Beautiful dogs are so precious. I was very sorry to hear about the loss of Francesca. Why don't we sit and have a chat? There's no need to worry about the Court. The judge was a pupil of mine. I'm very familiar with him. However, you have to tell me everything that barrister told you. Sure. You stay away from the Court tomorrow. Or the tabloids will have a field day. That will upset your mum. I understand. Desmond Chung's testimony is essential to the case. Every word is potentially game changing. Jolene Tsang's fate rests upon it. Why haven't you got it in black-and-white? Isn't it elementary? Black-and-white? The privileged don't want things on record. I worked as a Magistrate for so many years, I have not received a written testimony once. So tell me - why should I bother with one? A written testimony protects Jolene Tsang. It also protects us. What if Desmond Chung says something weird in Court? How weird could it be? He has been well briefed. So well that even Jar Jar Binks wouldn't mess this up. He is ready to help his mistress. Master Lam, don't forget he is a Chung now. I have prepared some notes... Your notes? Are they admissible in Court? Why don't you go and celebrate already? Just a few drinks is also good? She says you can celebrate already. Yes. Mr. Chung, where were you on the evening of the incident? I was at the studio filming a TV show. Then I went to visit Jolene Tsang at her place. When I got there, I saw our daughter laying on the floor. There was a lot of blood. You said you walked into Jolene Tsang's house; could you tell me about the front door of the house? The door was locked. So I switched on the nightlight, took out the keys to unlock the front door. Wasn't the front door unlocked? That's a leading question! The front door was locked. I needed to unlock the door with a key. Are you certain? Yes, I am. The door was locked. I object to this statement! Counsel, Mr. Chung is one of your witnesses, what are you objecting to? Mr. Lam? Counsel? Mr. Lam! Hostile witness, make him a hostile witness. Without a written testimony from Chung, how are we supposed to proceed? Mr. Lam, this is your last witness. Is there a request you'd like to make? You? I have no further questions. No more requests. Members of the Jury, have you reached a verdict? Yes, your Honour. By 6-to-1, we find the Defendant, Guilty. Ms. Tsang, please stand. After deliberation by the Jury, You have been found guilty of manslaughter. This case's victim was a young disabled girl. As her mother, not only did you not protect your daughter's welfare, but you inflicted such cruelty on her, that caused grave injuries, and led to her death. A harsh sentence is required, to act as a deterrent. The Court now orders you to serve 17 years in prison. I didn't do it! I didn't kill my daughter! Officer. I've been framed! I didn't do it... We will lodge an appeal for you, I promise. It's not me! I didn't kill my daughter! Why you put me to jail? "Sure win" "Unassailable” "Case closed". You are too lazy to even have a written testimony ready. Always bigging you self up. How long were you a Magistrate for? Never got promoted. What's there to be proud of? You knew she was innocent. Tail between your legs? You've fucked her life up. Ms. Tsang, the Court of Appeal has written back. I am sorry. They will not hear your case. Are you done? Keep her at home if you don't want me to stare. Or bring your mum? I won't be staring at your mum. Unless she's still got it? You know how the song goes? You're a MILF and I'm a motherf... Put the bottle down! What's wrong? Chicken? That's not a punch. Let them do it. Stop beating yourself up. And picking fights every night is not going to change anything. Though we've been friends for all these years, I can't be your bodyguard every night. Then don't! When I first qualified to be a barrister, I told myself: I am good enough to stand on my own feet. I don't need to suck up to those rich bastards. For 20 years, I worked hard and achieved nothing. So I moved on and became a Magistrate. Still, I refused to suck up to anyone. I spent 10 years being stuck at the same place. That's a wake up call. I got out, and found the richest bastard there is to find. And that rich bastard set me up to fail. I thought it was going to be a triumphant return. Instead, I messed up an innocent life. This woman just lost her daughter, and they put her away for 17 years. Who was I kidding? I always wanted to be amongst those rich bastards. I just didn't know how. I thought I hit jackpot with the Chung's. I got nothing out of it but guilt. Adrian Lam always looks down upon the suck ups. Turns out I am the biggest suck up. If you were the biggest suck up, you'd be sucking up another rich family already. Look, you might have let down one person, but you can make it right for many many more. Why did you go to Law School in the first place? Try to remember. Brother Bo, Back to your case, you're clearly framed for something you haven't done. I will sort it out, whatever it takes! Brother Bo, We all love our parents. Cursing them isn't going to help. Trust me. I am on the case. You have my word. Granny Tam, Your granddaughter will be all right. I have the CCTV footage. Crystal clear. She didn't hit anyone. The cops beat her up. I am certain she will get off all the charges. She won't be wronged. You have my word. Sister Wah, Prince has briefed me your case. Gangsters need to follow rules too. You are running a business, and that little punk got his way and stole your watch? We can't have that! I will make sure you are not convicted. What if he comes back for trouble? I will get you a job at a sauna. Working for someone will give you protection. We promise. You will be taken care of. We submitted a letter for a visit. Mr. Lam was on the case two years ago. That way! Master Adrian, Chan Ball came back to HK for cancer treatment, but decided to take his own life. He left behind a letter. He regrets how he wronged Jolene Tsang in Court two years ago. The doctor says he may not survive the night. We messed up Jolene Tsang's life. Please, stay alive and make it right. On that fateful night, my daughter had a bit of a fever. I went to the garden. After I put Elsa to sleep, I was arrested, for child neglect. They said I caused Elsa's injuries. I've been framed! I didn't do it... Prince and I looked everywhere for Chan Ball. Once we heard he was back in town, and left a note that could change everything, God is giving us another chance. God has a long to-do list. When's your turn? I won't go visit Jolene with you. And she is right to ignore you. Looking for redemption? You deserve that chance? Ever since she was put away, I have pushed and pushed. But the Police consider the case closed. No more investigation. Now that Chan Ball is dead. I am still filled with regret. Even though 9 out of 10 people die with regret, I don't want to be one of them. Because of you, I am also one of them. Just leave me alone. May I speak to you about Adrian... I have spoken to a few firms. Jolene is seeking legal help from others already. She will probably not use me this time. If he is on the case, "probably" becomes "definitely". If you thought Adrian was so bad, why didn't you suggest to do the case alone? But I knew it was a massive undertaking, And you were new to the game. Wanting a safety net was normal. But if you did go solo, things might have been different. He was wrong. But I don't think you were blameless either. Someone senior coming to... ...beg for a second chance. You think that was easy? Brother Bo. I never intended to stand you up. My case is due in court next week! You are quitting on me now? No, no, Brother Bo. But there is another case, a case that I need to do. Please let me work on that... I will refund every penny. Give me a million dollars. Bloody hell, that's harsh. Come on, Brother Bo. Harsh? Who's being harsh? That's not what I meant... If you kill me now, you are letting down an innocent woman. Because of my incompetence, she has been put away for 17 years. All because of my incompetence. One shot, and one shot only. Never again... ...never again! You are just a scumbag in a suit. Loyalty? My ass. You have two days. I want my money. Should I call 9997 My gang just told me... that Master Adrian got beaten up. That's why I am here. No big deal. How is he doing? The doctor is checking up on him now. Watch out for enemies. My father was a gang boss. He's now in Stanley Prison. He got convicted for money laundering. It was Master Adrian who took the case. He really tried to help my Dad. Worked extra hard for him. After a few all-nighters, he was so tired he crashed his car. His wife at the time was so mad at him. She wondered, why he would do so much for a gang boss. After a few fights, they spilt up. It's natural to work hard for a case. Even though we lost the case, my father never blamed Adrian for it. I was in my teens at the time, and Dad said I should become a barrister when I grew up. Following in the footsteps of Adrian. So, that's why they call you Prince, I always wondered why. Prince? What Prince, huh? Dad wouldn't let me be involved in his business. My brother looks after it. Master Adrian. We can't let this one go. I will get people to rough up Brother Bo. If you don't want violence, I will work it out with Brother Bo. Being beaten up, is better than being beaten by guilt. I am sorry. Ms. Tsang. Thank you for agreeing to see us. Even though we have Chan Ball's suicide note... Got a cigarette? I don't think we can smoke in here. As I said, even with Chan Ball's suicide note, the Court still isn't obliged to hear our appeal. Mr. Lam has spent a lot of time... ...doing research on the concept of the Dying Declaration. There are quite a few legal precedents to support this appeal. He is very well-prepared this time. He has turned down all his other cases to do this. He even got into a fight because of this. Okay. Other lawyers have said pretty much the same thing. You give me what you have, I will pass it on to them. Hope you don't mind. Ms. Tsang. We really want to help you. That's very kind of you, Mr. Lam. I am so sorry...| am. We are here today, because I wanted you to see how I suffer so. What I saw in Court, your flippant faces, I will never forget. Now you are begging for a chance for redemption? You have let me down. You will never live without that guilt. May you live a long life, a guilt-ridden life. Ms. Tsang! Yes, there are many lawyers out there who could help you. If you find someone you trust, we can still help whoever that is for free. All we wish for, is your swift release. I don't know what other lawyers will do for you. As much as I don't know, you would never know either. I saw Elsa with my own eyes. We will give 100% to get you out. Whatever it takes. All I have thought about in the last two years, is how I could get you out of jail. Ms. Tsang, please give us another shot. It has been a difficult decision. But we are of the view that the verdict was incorrect. We now direct the case to be set for retrial. Ms. Tsang has given permission to you, to keep her house keys, until the end of the Court case. We have put everything back in the house as it was before. Things that are deemed irrelevant to the case, were left as they were. Sign here and the keys are yours. Thank you sir. I am indebted to you. My son was in Bangkok to meet the Royal Family. He's making good business connections in Thailand. Ronald can simply contact the Prime Minister directly from now on. Thank you. The kids are all grown up. No point of us interfering anymore. Victoria and Desmond, on the other hand, I want to give my two cents worth. That woman is in jail now. If we can keep her there, that would be ideal. I understand. Ben, find out who the advising counsel is on the case I told you about. I will see him. Do you know anyone working on Financial dispute cases? Of course, is that what you want to get into? Who doesn't want to make some money? We have worked so hard for so little. But it is almost impossible to get into that world. That little circle of the wealthy, is impossible to get into. Who do you think you are? Think about your background. You don't belong to that world. You thought it's about working hard, right? Being a nobody is hard work for sure. Hey, it doesn't have to be like that. What's happening? The Justice Department is retrying Jolene for murder. Does it mean if we lose, I will do life? If you are convicted, yes. If you don't appeal, you are in for another 13 years without holidays. If you do and win, you are out straight away; If you do and lose, that's the rest of your life in jail. You need to consider this carefully. I'd rather be in jail for the rest of my life, than not getting justice for my daughter. Prince. The Justice Department has its own Prosecutors. But for a case as serious as this, they generally get someone from the outside to handle it. For a murder case, the choices are limited to these four. I will get my clerks to contact them one by one. They will be invited to come to see you. You simply ask them for legal advice. But don't ask them to represent you. Once they have come to see you, and discussed your case with you, the Justice Department can no longer hire them to be the Prosecutor. Conflict of interest, you see. They simply cannot take up the prosecution job. If we do this right, we are eliminating the four best Prosecutors in the business. I have dealt with the other two judges. Last but not least, her ladyship. She will not have a good impression on Jolene Tsang. Her husband left her for another woman. And the Jury? What can we do to influence them? Although I'm indebted to Madam Chung, I prefer to handle the case subtly. Approaching the Jury is too much of a risk. I don't think it is necessary. What if it goes wrong? Who is going to take the fall? We can dance within the ambit, but if Justice prevails, sometimes it does, then it's her daughter that would have to face the music. Not us. Forget about witnesses, and evidences and whatnot, to the Jury, it's probably just a show, in the end they will always convict the bad guy. My job is to make sure that we have the right showman. Who's the Prosecutor? I've come to notice that the defendant has been trying to... conflict out all the possible fiat counsel by meeting them for advice. So the Justice Department is still searching. Have they seen Kam Yuen Shan? Most probably tomorrow. I want him to be the Prosecutor. He doesn't like sneaky people. Tell him what the defence is doing. Understood. Let's have some food. This way please. Mr. Kam. Mr. Adrian Lam is here to see you. Thank you. Hello, Mr. Kam, how do you do? Mr. Lam, I am a traditionalist. I am Jolene Tsang's defence counsel... In the past week, your team has arranged for Nancy Chan, Tony Tse, and Shirley Mo to meet your client. They may not have known what you were trying to do. But I do. I turned down the chance to meet Jolene Tsang, refused to meet your clerk, now I find you here at my office. Originally, I wasn't going to see you, but there's one thing that I would like you to know. Mr. Lam doesn't need any coffee. He will be leaving shortly. I have contacted the Justice Department. I will take on the Prosecutor role for Ms. Tsang's retrial. We will be in touch about a pre-trial review. Your sly tactics won't work on me. Maybe you can fool some, but the heavens are watching you. The legal system isn't something you can play with. You deserve to be condemned for your insidiousness. Wow, no bickering today. What's the point of bickering now? Win the argument in the Court. You are still very childish. I have only recently become a bit childish. Been mixing with the wrong crowd, I guess. There sure is something good you can rub off? What good is there? I am a man of reason... except when it requires otherwise. It's just a Court case. Yet he looks like he's going to church. To each his own. Don't let that get on your nerve. I can buy you one of those later. Court! Members of the Jury, we are dealing with... ... a murder case today. If you cannot be certain that... ...the defendant committed a murder, I suggest you could consider manslaughter. (Damn him) Officer. Here is your recent disciplinary report. Your Honour, I ask if the witness and members of the Jury could be excused for a moment. May the witness and members of the Jury leave the Court room. I have doubt as to Mr. Lam's upcoming questions, I believe they will be irrelevant to this case. If disciplinary reports are considered irrelevant in Court, what's the point of having them at all? Might as well let them run loose. Mr. Lam. Do you have a good understanding of the word "relevance"? It's not my job to teach you I do not doubt your qualification as a barrister, but doubting for doubting's sake is not how we do things here. Your doubt needs "relevance". Is your question going to be relevant? Please be sure of that. He has been found to have tampered with evidence If he tells the Court Jolene Tsang's doors and windows were undamaged, we may consider his testimony unreliable. There are photos of the crime scene. We have agreed that they are admissible evidence. The door and the windows, were clearly undamaged. Are you trying to say, when the Police arrived at the crime scene, things were damaged, only for this witness to... interfere with the crime scene? Did he fix the door, did he patch up the windows? And took the photos after things have been fixed? Is that what you're trying to say? I am deliberating. And how would that take? Professionalism may not be a concern of yours. But have you ever concerned that you are dragging the whole legal profession down with you. Members of the Jury, to be able to assess this case, you only need one thing, that thing is Common Sense. What is Common Sense? Fairness. Justice. It's as simple as that. When this trial is over, you should reach a verdict of "Guilty" or "Not Guilty". The Prosecution is incorrect. If you limit your options to "Murder" or "Manslaughter", you are limiting yourselves to "Guilty" or "Guilty". So let's use some Common Sense. Let us see Justice prevail here. I call upon Chan Hong Man. Mr. Chan, do you know Chan Ball? Yes, he was my father. There is something I would like you to look at. Relevance! Have we not discussed this already? How is this irrelevant? Anything that is stated in a Dying Declaration, is considered factual. It's considered reliable. Here, we have Chan Ball's suicide note, in which he wrote he framed the Defendant. Chan Ball wrote: I am full of regrets. I wronged Jolene Tsang that day. I lied in Court, and she was harmed. Anything else? That was the relevant part. Counsel. For Chan Ball to "wrong" Tsang, it could mean Chan saw nothing at all. Or it could also mean Chan saw someone committing a crime, but that someone wasn't the Defendant. Or it could mean Chan witnessed something the Defendant had done, but it wasn't what he told the Court. Or it could mean Chan saw someone that wasn't the Defendant, who did something that he didn't talk about in Court. What are you trying to prove with this suicide note? Common sense. It proves that the Defendant was "wronged". I am sorry, Mr. Lam, this note only tells us that Chan, just the same as other residents of the village, didn't witness what happened that night. Excuse me, Mr. Kam, I disagree. The note says nothing about "not witnessing anything”, that is merely your interpretation. Members of the Jury, please do not take that into consideration. What proof do you have that he witnessed anything at all? None? No evidence, no witnesses, now even a dead man isn't of help. I don't know what else you can do. What else is there that could prove Jolene wasn't the killer? Nothing, none. That's why we need some reverse thinking. We are not trying to prove Jolene's innocence. We are trying to figure out who is guilty. No one is going to help us. We are on our own. What are you doing? Stop, right there! That expert witness drew his conclusions, from Elsa's head wound. Whoever pushed her, was likely to be standing where you are now. Why is this display case become empty? Don't you find it strange? There used to be photos here, family photos. Desmond didn't want the world to know about his relationship with Jolene. So he tidied up that night, before anyone else showed up in the house. If I stood here, all these family photos were in front of me, and I pushed Elsa towards that kitchen counter. Who would've been angered by these photos? So angry that hurting a little girl became okay? Just keep an eye on him, 24/7. Wherever she goes, whoever she meets, whatever she says, whatever she eats, whatever she poops, I want a record of it, all of it. Come on man, poop? Really? Really what? You really are expensive, that's what. They are coming. I talk to you later. You've been with Desmond Chung for a long time. Has he ever talked about his wife? That relationship lasted less than two months. That woman stopped seeing me again. It was Desmond who continued to see me. People think Desmond married into that family for money. That never bothered you? Friends who knew about us, all thought I kept Desmond for his money, too. I came from a very modest background. Didn't have any money growing up. No one really took care of me either. How long was I able to work as a model? All I ever wanted was a family of my own. Desmond gives me that family. What he does outside of our family, that's nothing to do with us. Have a look at these photos. Try to recall, what you saw when you sobered up. Was there anything else? Desmond was shouting for me. When I walked into the living room, I saw Desmond kneeling down next to Elsa, blood everywhere. What was Desmond doing? I want a clear move-by-move description. He was examining Elsa, and asked me to call 999. I ran to the garden looking for my phone, when I returned, I saw him in the kitchen, throwing two water bottles away. Two water bottles? Why was he doing that when his daughter was gravely injured? What happened next, I have told you already. Thank you. Wow, that's not a good idea... That lot bent the rules two years ago. You think they will play nice this time? What has playing nice done for us? If Justice doesn't prevail, what can we do? Concerns? I am just worried about you... Are you worried? Not at all. That's good, I won't feel so bad when I blame it all on you. Now I am worried. Just do this for me - call Victoria Chung this evening. Then bring him along. What's the problem? I need to take this. Hello? Mrs. Chung, I trust you remember who Chan Ball was. This is his son calling. Apart from the suicide note, my father also left behind evidence of your involvement. I just want money, not a lot... I found a set of keys in Desmond's car. After a bit of digging, I figured out where that bitch lives. I went to see her. I presumed she was just a gold-digger, I thought I could just pay her off. But she wasn't home. That bastard girl hit and threw things at me when she saw me. She even bit me. So I pushed her away... She lost her balance and fell onto the table. She fell and died. That's her, be it unfortunate, destiny. Jolene Tsang might not have done anything, but that bitch, no one should take pity on her. Prince, what are you going to play in Court? Something juicy. Shush! You will soon find out. Dr. Chung, Is Victoria Chung your wife? Yes, she is. Then you must be able to recognise her voice. Let's listen to what she's got to say. That bastard girl hit and threw things at me when she saw me She even bit me This is absolutely misleading! You are misleading the Jury! Switch it off, immediately! Mr. Lam! Please, switch it off for now. She fell and died. That's her, be it unfortunate, destiny. Your Honour. Okay, your Honour. Go on, turn it off. I strongly object to this recording of unknown origins. Your Honour, I have the accompanying video that goes with this recording. You can see the faces in it. I doubt you can call it of "unknown origin". If you allow it, I can play it immediately. I object! First, the video is of unknown origin; Second, the video may have been edited or tampered with; Third, to ensure a fair and just trial, the Prosecution should've been informed in advance. There are multiple violations of legal convention; have you forgotten the code of conduct? You have not seen the clip yet, how are you to judge that it's been edited or tampered with? Court adjourned. Come inside, all three of you. Why did you hide this from me? Let him be the Kamikaze man. You don't want to be a part of this. Wow! You make it sound so noble. The honour is all yours. After I left the house, I called him and, I told him to sort out the mess he started. Was it you who paid-off the security guard? She was incredibly nervous. That was understandable. Jim, you have to sort it out for us. We can't be blackmailed. Your Honour. In light of the recent development, I request the Court to be adjourned. In regards to this video, I expect written statements... ...from both of you before the next session. There's video evidence now. Why hasn't that woman been arrested? That was just a guerrilla attack. Just to plant an impression on the Jury's minds. Let them know the truth. It probably worked. In all likelihood, the video won't be admissible in Court. But if that video isn't admissible, it is not evidence. What can be done now? Wait for her to admit to committing the crime? Inadmissible. Nothing to worry about. Even if it's out there, they won't be able to use it in Court. We are always ready for issuing a defamation or filing an injunction. No one has the guts to play against your family. Now let's get rid of this idiot. What was his name? Adrian Lam. Get the tickets prepared. Once the Court is done, you two can leave Hong Kong immediately. I can make sure he won't be able to attend Court. Of course, legally done, and there won't be any journalists in Court. Hello, Superintendent Cheung. I am the advising counsel for Jolene Tsang's trial. About the video that was illegally obtained. We are submitting a memo. It requires an urgent review. The charge is "Access to a Computer with Dishonest Intent". Adrian Lam. We suspect you that, at 10:30am on 17 October, you used a computing device on Sandy Bay, that is considered "Access to a Computer with Dishonest Intent". You are now under arrest, please come with us. Get a move on. I have spoken to all my contacts. None of them is interested to help you. Expect to be locked up for the full 48 hours. They just want to prevent me from appearing in court tomorrow. Told you not to go against the Chung family. Even if you are not giving up, you might want to dissuade others. What? Michelle Liu's firm was going to... ...get Evelyn to work for them... ...on those financial cases. Michelle has worked closely for the Chung's. Now you know... ...if Evelyn carries on tomorrow, her legal career is over. Shan, let's have a talk, shall we? I don't think that's appropriate. Yes, Patrick. Adrian Lam won't be able to prove the video's relevance. And the evidence was illegally obtained. The case doesn't need to be dragged on. I don't intend to carry on. Please get someone else to take my place. And you should drop all charges against this woman. I will lay it out in my written statement. It will be plain for all to see. It's your duty to ensure that there's a fair trial. The video was clearly illegally obtained. It can't be fair to use it in Court, or even let it affect your judgement. How dare you talk about fairness with me. How many guilty persons have you set free over the years? Is it fair then? It wasn't those people I intended to help. I was only upholding the system. Now that you mention it, the system simply does not accept this evidence, have you forgotten all the rules? Have you honoured the system? If you have honoured the system, you wouldn't be affected by such nonsense. Where is your duty to the Court? With all due respect, you are using your own so-called feelings... ...to decide what Justice is, forgetting all about the procedural fairness, and laws. Without rules and principles, there's no point of having any lawyer or even you. We all have feelings, don't we? Senior Counsel. The private investigator has found out; the Chung's have booked their flights to leave town. As soon as they finish in Court, they will be gone. Even if we get the Court to adjourn, it is not going to make a difference. They will be gone forever. Nothing we can do about that. They will appear in Court, because they want things to be over. Once they are gone, the Court can't summon them back. Too many technicalities. They will get away with this. Do you have a plan? Just in case you don't get out in time, I have prepared a written statement, Here are some precedents, all related to the video clip we want to show as evidence. Have a look. How do you rate yourself as a defence counsel? Is there a problem? I can make changes. A problem? Yes, the whole thing is one big problem! These are not reported cases. And this one? That's ancient history. These two are just ridiculous. Cases from Australia? Who'd take them seriously? Master Adrian, we can make revisions... Shut up already! Who's in charge here? You know why you got a chance at TK's firm? He just wanted a pretty girl at the office as eye candy. That's all. Don't overestimate yourself. You are nowhere good enough for this job. What's the matter now? Let's spill it and work it out. What's there to work out? You worked all day on this statement, and I am still stuck here. Look, this is no longer your trial. Not anymore. Stop being a burden already. That's it! No need to talk to her, let her decide for herself. Officer! I need to make a call! This is Adrian. Rearrange your schedule, you've got to come to my trial tomorrow. What's going on? Officer! Have you found the Officer in Charge yet? It's being arranged. At 15:24, you told me "it's being arranged”. At 18:42, you told me "it's being arranged”. At 20:47, you told me "it's being arranged”. It is now 21:32, and it's the fourth time give me the same bullshit. Remember those timestamps. You'll have to explain them... ...each and every one of them in Court! What are you going to arrange now? James Tung knows what you are like. He is citing procedural fairness to shackle you. Even if you were to quit now, someone else is going to take your place. And the outcome will remain the same. I know what they are playing at. Master Kwok. It's the Chung's mess, not yours. Don't act above your station. Since you know sign language, let us introduce you to someone. Ben Good evening. Good evening. I'll tell the head, she will know your name. Thank you Mrs. Chung, thank you very much. The media has been taken care of. There will be no journalists in Court tomorrow. You will only see our people in Court. Don't worry. All of us have anticipated what they're going to ask you about, let's go through them. Shall we? Sure! Mr. Lam. My name is Ko. We have logged the time of your requests, every single time. And every single time when I reject your request, there is an entry in the log book, a reason that will be accepted in Court. Madam Ko, you are doing nothing. We are investigating your case. I have given evidence, you have gone through my phone. You don't know what I am going to show in Court, and you can't find any accomplices. What else is there to investigate? I leave it with you to explain to the judge yourself. You will probably be granted bail. Just not now. Right, I see, two can play that game. Let me tell you now. I know how police bail works. I am going to refuse bail, and when I fail to appear in Court tomorrow, it's up to you, Madam Ko to explain to the judge. And you won't have anything to say! And I promise someone will have to take responsibility for this shitshow. Your bosses... ...won't protect you... ...when the shit hits the fan. You must know this better than I do. Hold up! Prince asked me to come. There is only one man, that may get me out of this shithole. His name is Cheung Tak Wo. Senior Superintendent. Okay, I will look him up. Call someone now. The head guy won't come down unless there's blood. There's a suicide attempt! I'm thirsty, Officer. I need water. Drinking after losing so much blood is not advisable. Don't you know? Good morning, Senior Superintendent Cheung Cheung, I know you are here. Cheung, come this way! Master Adrian. When you first started out, who was there to help you? I corrected your grammar, your spelling. And your reports were always impressive enough for you to get noticed. I have been there for you since day one. I just need to get out of here. Court! This trial is getting all the attention right now. You know what you are getting yourself into. I am rattling their cage, not yours! Why are you teaming up with them? You are not just messing with me, you are messing with the whole legal system! We, all of us, will suffer for it. But I need to listen to orders. What's the order? To lock me up for 48 hours? To prevent me from appearing in Court? That is shameless. I will sit here for the whole 48 hours. If I let you go now, what am I going to say to my boss? I let you be the hero, and I live to be the zero. Give me a name. That's the best I can do. That's all. A video clip was submitted by the Defence as evidence. Your Honour, I have prepared a written statement, in which I laid out the argument in favour of the submission. It was submitted to you this morning, and it's on your desk in front of you now. Please consider the argument. It was you who filmed that video! I couldn't think of a more suitable person to sell out. It's either selling you out or me being stuck. No need to run away. Look, Prince and I will come and save your arse tonight. Dr. Chan, I have a question for you. Giving someone lots of water after heavy blood loss, what will happen? It's a matter of life or death. I need an answer now! Counsel. Please don't waste any more valuable Court time. 10 more seconds, I will be with you shortly. The Jury won't be allowed to see that video. There's no point in arguing. If we carry on like this, the Chung's will be on a plane and gone. When I was locked up, I came up with a plan. I am going to get... James Tung and Desmond Chung... ...to tell the Jury the truth. Kam is going to stop you for sure. Well, let's see about that. Your Honour, I withdraw my request to adjourn this trial. I also understand the video will not be admissible. We are ready to continue with the trial. Members of the Jury, you heard a 10-second audio clip last time. The Defense has since withdrawn that from the Court. You need not to consider what you heard. I call upon James Tung. Mr. Tung, Where were you, at 10:30am on 17 October? I was in Sandy Bay. Were you aware that the meeting between you, Madame Chung and Victoria Chung, was filmed by an HD camera? And your conversation... ...was recorded by a parabolic microphone? Objection! The video in question... ...has been withdrawn from this Court. The video is no longer evidence, and therefore it is a leading question. I take that back. Mr. Tung, what were you doing with the Chung's? I was giving some legal opinions to Madame Chung and her daughter. Because of legal privilege, I won't say any further. Isn't legal privilege wonderful? Such a beautiful way to avoid a question. Not to worry. How about another question? As the Chung's legal advisor, I trust it wasn't the first time they sought legal advice from you? Did Madame Chung ask you to take care of Victoria? First, I do not understand your question. Second, this is a leading question. It should not appear in your examination in chief. I am sure the Prosecutor would oppose such question at this stage. James Tung was a well-respected barrister... ...before he retired. I object to the defence counsel's questioning of Tung's integrity. I now humbly ask, with great respect, that from the conversation you had with the Chung's, you were made aware that it was Victoria Chung who... ...pushed the victim that led to her death. And your advice to them was to frame the Defendant. Now, I ask, are you a man? Mr. Kam? I am sorry, your Honour. I couldn't hear the Defence's question properly. Please repeat the question so that I can decide. Why is he helping us? God knows. Mr. Lam! Yes, yes, your Honour. Let me repeat my question. Mr. Tung, I will ask very slowly, to make sure Prosecution can hear clearly. You, clearly knew, Victoria Chung, was the one who, inflicted injury on the victim, that led to her eventual death. Yet you advised Victoria Chung, and her husband, to frame the Defendant. My question is this: are you a man? Your Honour, Objection. Objection sustained. But I would like to answer that. You can't even ask a question properly. First, all the things that you've just said have no factual basis, I will just say "never happened”, "no idea what you're talking about". Your whole speech just became pointless. Second, you asked whether I was a man. Let me answer that right now. I am. How does that help your case? If your purpose is to provoke me... ...to unveil some truth, give it a break. We talk about evidence in Court, not unravelling your version of the truth. The layman may find the truth fascinating, but you have to have the evidence to support them. Where are they? I'm afraid your version of the truth is insignificant in here. I'm here to assist the Court today, but you have wasted a lot of my time. Unlike your time, have nothing to treasure about. Let me tell you my favourite quote, "We would like to believe that we are all equals, but the truth is we are not, and we never will be." The Jury may not know about the law, but I thought you've been to law school, Haven't you, Mr. Lam? Mr. Tung, the truth we are facing here, involves an innocent woman, and her freedom for the rest of her life. You just told the Court that "The Truth is insignificant in here", that's what you just told the Jury. How could you utter such thing? I don't know what kind of senior counsel you were, but I can safely conclude you are a man with no sense of decency. You also said, people who don't know the law are "laymen". And only these "laymen"... ...are interested in the Truth. How dare you challenge the members of the Jury? Are you saying... ...the Jury has no right to be here? The role of a Jury, is to act as a check and balance to people like you. You don't think they can think critically? Would you like to know what they think of you now? You behave as if you are above us all, how? You started mingling with the Chung's, and now you think you are in their social class? May I quote from your favourite quote. "You would like to believe you are their equals, but the truth is you are not, and never will be." Counsel! This is a Court of Law, not Hyde Park's Speakers' Corner. You may continue to ask your questions, if you have no questions left to ask, please be seated. Your Honour, please remain calm. I have one more question to ask. Mr. Tung, Desmond Chung will appear as a witness next. I trust you have briefed him well, and he will give a flawless performance. Of course, you are going to cite... ...legal privilege or some such to avoid this question. So, allow me, I will take it back. This is absurd! I've been in and out of the Court for so many years. I've never endured such a disrespectful trial! I will certainly report this to the Chief Justice! Enough already, Mr. Tung. Go and enjoy that well-deserved cigar. Counsel. Your Honour, I beg your pardon. I request a short break of 20 minutes. I need to prepare for the next witness. Request granted. Court! I need to speak to Jolene now. Let me arrange. And I need Photo #4. I need you to tell me again, about that angel Elsa made. Water bottles? Yes, I picked them up this morning. The police only took pictures of the bin. They didn't take the bottles as evidence. Are they going to be useful? We are bluffing him. He knows he is in the wrong. He's going to crack. Watch out. Mr. Kam... I will do what is right. Throughout the years, as long as I am here, I will fulfil my duty. We call upon Desmond Chung. Dr. Chung, you've been married for ten years, but your affair with the Defendant lasted for eight. Would you agree, that you are a dishonest person? I disagree. Where were you on the night of the incident? I was at the studio, filming a TV show. After that? During the filming, I received a call from the Defendant. I couldn't pick up for obvious reasons. So I called her back when I was done filming. She didn't pick up, so I made my way to her house to see her. Apart from the Defendant, did anyone else try to contact you that night? Yes. My wife tried to call me. Tell me the sequence of the events, did you go to the Defendant's house... ...after you received a call from your wife? Yes. Why? I had a fight with my wife over the phone. So I didn't feel like going home, and decided to go to see the Defendant. But you just told the Court, that you tried to call the Defendant, she didn't pick up, and that's why you made your way to her place. What actually happened? Are you hiding something from us? I am not. May I suggest, that it was your wife who told you to go to the Defendant's house? As you rushed into the house, you saw your daughter laying in the living room. Do you agree? I do not. Please take a look at all the barristers over there. Have you met them before? Or are you going to hide something from us again? Yes, I have met them before. When? Last night. Did you meet them all at once, as a group? Yes. Did they give you legal advice last night? Did they teach you how to deal with the questioning today? I don't suppose you're going to deny that? Now look at the gallery, there is not one single person from the media here. Look at these barristers. All these counsels. All diligently writing their so-called "Watching Briefs". Something is wrong. Dr. Chung, it feels like you think you are above the law. Whether you agree or not, you are going to answer "do not agree" anyway. I take that question back. That's the end of my questioning. Your Honour. Your Honour, I will take over the questioning now. Dr. Chung, can you tell us, what happened when you arrived... ...at the Defendant's house that night? I got out of the car, and walked into the house. Please be more specific. I got out of the car, walked towards the front door. Turned on the nightlight, and fetched my keys to open the door. As soon as I got into the house, I saw my injured daughter. I immediately went over to check on her, at the same time, I tried to get the Defendant's attention. She came in then went out to get her phone to call 999. How long was the Defendant away for? About one or two minutes. Within that one or two minutes, you and the victim were the only people, in the house? There were no other witnesses? Do you agree? Yes, I agree. Allow me to show you something. Do you recognise these water bottles? I do not. Is that so? Are you sure? Yes I am. Do remember what you've just told the Court. Dr. Chung, The two water bottles that were just shown to you, were they the same brand as what the Defendant had in her house? Yes. Please look at the evidence in front of you. I refer to the photo P8-04. Have you noticed that your daughter was very into the knitted angel dolls? Yes. Did you notice the nightlight at the front door, had a knitted angel doll made by your daughter? It didn't leave an impression on me. She had the whole house filled with these dolls, that's why I didn't pay particular attention. Dr. Chung, there's something that is crucial to this case. It is your integrity. I would like you to answer this question honestly. When you wife went to bribe Chan Ball, were you involved? I don't understand your question. It's not a complicated question. Let me ask you again. When your wife went to bribe Chan Ball, were you involved? Please answer now! Were you, or were you not, involved? I was not involved. The bribing of Chan Ball by your wife, is that something, you condoned or otherwise? Someone is trying tip off Desmond Chung! Your Honour, I suspect activities are taking place in Court, that may be considered "Obstruction of Justice". My clerk will monitor the situation, and report any activities instantly. Prince, as soon as you notice Dr. Chung... ...turning his head toward the Gallery for advice, please jot down the accomplices. Let's see who wants their licence suspended. No problem! I am a keen observer, and I can spin my chair super fast. Counsels, watch out! I am obliged to remind everyone here, "Obstruction of Justice" is a serious matter. The Court will not tolerate such activity. Mr. Kam, you may continue. Dr. Chung, please answer the question now. The bribing of Chan Ball by your wife, you condoned or otherwise? I... Did you condone your wife's action, Dr. Chung? I don't remember. I am not asking whether you remember or not. I am asking whether you condoned her action or not. I did not condone her action. Not condoning implies you were aware of her action? So you knew all along! How much longer did you intend to lie to the Court? Your wife pushed your daughter over, and you conspired with her to give false testimony in Court. There was a trial, and now a retrial, how much time and effort have we wasted? That same time and effort... ...could've been better used, and not wasted on garbage like you! Mr. Kam! I have no further questions. Defence? Yes, your Honour. Dr. Chung, Prosecution asked about these knitted angel dolls, hand made by your own daughter. Could you please tell us, what this angel doll was covering? The nightlight at the front door. The nightlight at the front door. Did you say, you had to switch on the nightlight... ...before you took the keys out? Yes. Is it because it was too dark, and you were not able to find your keys... ...without the lights on? Yes. You are lying again. I am not. I switched on the nightlight, then I unlocked the front door. No, you did not switch on any lights. This is a photo from the police report, taken the day after Jolene Tsang was arrested. Look at the nightlight. Do you see a light bulb? Yes or no? Yes or no? No. No. Your daughter put a knitted angel doll at the front door, so that you won't miss it. Your daughter wanted to attach the doll to the nightlight, the Defendant helped by removing the light bulb. Otherwise, it would've been impossible. You didn't switch on the nightlight. There was no light bulb. I really did unlock the front door! No, you did not. Like you said, it was too dark out there, without a light, you wouldn't have been able to unlock the door. You could get into the house because the front door was already opened. Your wife, Victoria Chung, was there before you. She left in a hurry, and left the door wide-open. That's why you could get in, in the dark. The door was wide-open. You lied to the Court! You lied to the Jury! You did so because you knew... ...the truth would mean... ...the release of the Defendant. Let's look at these water bottles again. You told the Court, the Defendant bought this brand of water regularly. Let's take a look at the photo P8-05. Inside the rubbish bin, there are two bottles. Dr. Chung, as a doctor, please answer the following question. When a patient loses a lot blood, and is given a lot of water, what will happen? The patient will die! On the night of the incident, the Defendant saw you kneeling next to your daughter. Moments later, she saw you throwing away two water bottles. Your daughter was seriously injured, why were you concerned about something so trivial? You knew full well that, heavy blood loss and heavy water ingestion shouldn't mix. You never wanted your daughter alive. Because if she stayed alive, she would've told the truth, and your wife would be in deep trouble. All you've gained from being a Chung would be gone, all gone. Therefore, you gave your daughter plenty of water, even though she was bleeding heavily. One bottle after another. May I remind you, the members of the Jury will assess not only your words, but also your demeanor. Judging by the way you are looking right now, you seem to be telling the Court, that it wasn't the Defendant... ...who was afraid of the truth, it is you! Do the two of you know what you have done? If you really don't know, may the Court tell you now: you two conspired to murder the Defendant's daughter, who was also your very own daughter! Desmond Chung! Desmond Chung! Look at me! Is it true? Is it true? I have no further questions. Master Adrian. Phew. It's time for closing from both of you. Members of the Jury, I initially asked you to consider the nature of the crime. Today, I would like to say this to you. As a Prosecutor, my main objective is not... ...conviction. I am tasked to ensure every Defendant... ...gets a fair trial. After these past few days, you have been equipped with the facts to come to a fair verdict. Members of the Jury, I once told you... ...your Common Sense... ...would guide you to the correct verdict. You heard what have been said in Court, all the testimonies from the witnesses, I am now convinced that, you will reach the correct verdict, and clear the Defendant's name. Your Honour, I rest my case. Members of the Jury, you may now retire to deliberate... Wait a second! My colleague Ms. Fong said earlier that in the Court today... ...something is wrong. I am sorry, Ms. Fong. It's not just something. Today, here, everything is wrong! The Court of law... ...was meant to be a place of justice, a place of fairness. Look at it now, the privileged class is abusing the system. They think they are the master of everything, including the Law. They sit there, looking down on us. But I am telling them now. Today is not your day. Justice will prevail today. As someone who works on criminal cases, I have seen some of the ugliest things in the world. The darkest, most evil things are what we witness every day. But we carry on regardless, and put on our wigs and our gowns. The only thing... ...that motivates us, is that we can show the world a glimpse of justice, and not be manipulated by the rich like puppets. We used to say "all people are equal before the law". But we don't say that anymore. We now know "poor people are fucked before the law". Well, let's see who's getting fucked today. Enough is enough, I think you are done for today. I sure am done. Be seated immediately! Defence is seated. Mr. Lam, the defence counsel, acted very unprofessionally. You may choose to ignore his closing statement. Are you ready to retire and deliberate the final verdict? Yes, we are. You may now retire to deliberate. Members of the Jury, have you reached an unanimous verdict? Yes, your Honour. We the Jury find the Defendant, Jolene Tsang, Not Guilty. Defendant, please stand. Concerning the Murder of Elsa Tsang, The Court has found you Not Guilty. You are free to go. Court! Amazing. Thank you. I don't agree with what you did at all. I did what I had to do. I was unprofessional. I feel ashamed. If that's what it took to do the right thing, so be it. Thank you. Thank you. (God works for us) Yes! Desmond Chung, Victoria Chung. I am the Assistant Commissioner of the Anti Corruption Commission. I have reasons to believe that you are involved in... ...a case of witness bribery. Also, we have just been informed by the Police... ...that you are now murder suspects. Please come with us. This is a nice place, plenty of space. It's not that much space, it's only this much space. That's pitiful. You need at least this much space. I am sharing with two other counsels. He can introduce you to some useful people, that should help you with the rent for a bigger space. Beauty and the Gangs - that's a lovely gimmick. Well cool. I had a glimpse of her partners... ...so beautiful. Here's the deal. If Master Adrian joins the firm, we can rent the office next door, too. That's right, join us! How about my clients in Mongkok? They can take the MTR. Those beauties... you've got to consider them, Master Adrian. What beauties? The beautiful fixtures of the office, they are so lovely. Congratulations indeed. I like this place, I do. Granny, are you going to pay up? Have a look at this. Look at the scratch. She did that. Right here, that's where she scratched it. Tell her to pay up. I haven't got all day. Tell her to pay up. Be quiet! What's quiet, hurry up!
