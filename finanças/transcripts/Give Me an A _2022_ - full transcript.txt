Oh, my God, I thought Mr. J's class - was never gonna end. - Same. I hate the way he stares at me-- he's such a creep. Shit, I knew I had it somewhere. I totally got a demerit for having this in English today. Isn't that your third demerit this week? Oh, I got one in first period because - my skirt was too short. - Uh, does anyone have a pad? I think I just started my period. - I have a tampon? - Naomi doesn't wear tampons. - What? Why? - I don't know, I don't like - sticking things up my ass. - You don't stick it up your ass, you put it in your vajiji. That's what I meant, I just-- I don't know how to use it. She lives with her dad. Oh, okay, watch, demo. Vagina, insert applicator, push up, pull out, the end, don't leave it in overnight. - Here's another one. - Okay. - Hi. - Hi. Okay, ladies, here's your new uniforms. - Let's go. - Yes, Coach Judy. Wow, these are shorter than the old ones. Janie's gonna probably complain about them - not showing enough leg. - Shut up! I totally got a demerit for a skirt - longer than this today. - Ladies, come on, being sexy is powerful. Yeah, reclaim it, like, we might look like sluts, but we want to look like sluts. Yeah, I'm down, it's our bodies, - we do what we want. - Sure, totally, yes. But also, please, these uniforms came from a culture of pleasing men. Here we go with Danice and her feminism again. Fuck the patriarchy, we get it. Fuck the patriarchy! Y'all, I don't care about what we wear. I do this because I love cheer, I freakin' love dance, and I freakin' love you ladies. - We love you. - Okay, you got 60 seconds to get on the field, let's hustle.

Whole marriage, kids thing? Aww, you wanna get to know me, that's cute. Um, to be honest with you, I don't see myself participating in the patriarchal oppression of monogamy, marriage, or child-rearing at all. I think there are enough kids in the world. I intend to do what I want when I want, and help the young people who are already here. Ooh, I totally get that. That's admirable, man. Uh, I hate to ruin the moment, but because we were talking about the future, I have to ask... what happens if I get pregnant? We use protection. Obviously, but, I mean, that's not 100%. Accidents do happen, and now that abortion's no longer an option, I think we need to discuss what happens if that happens. Uh... well, I guess... we'll... we'll figure it out. Might be the lawyer in me, but I think we need to figure it out now. - Who're you calling? - Mm. Megan, hi, I have that last-minute contract for you. Would you mind just... having a little chat - with my attorney? - Your attorney? - Yeah. - Okay, yeah. So, Mark, meet Megan. Megan, Mark. - Hi. - Oh, hi, Mark. Congratulations on having sex with Sienna. Oh, uh... thank you. I'll go through this as quickly as I can, so you two can get to it. Do you consent - to being recorded? - You mean during sex? No, just so that we can go over the contract. Oh, right, uh... okay, yeah. So, this is just a simple sex contract, stating that you and Sienna agree to go into a consensual sexual encounter to be concluded at any point in time that either of you so choose. Do you agree? I'm sorry, I require a verbal yes or no. - Oh, yes. - Yes for me. You both agree to use prophylactic condoms, as directed, during said sexual encounter. - I do. I mean, yes. - Me, too. Finally, Mark, should Sienna accidentally become pregnant as a result of this consensual sexual encounter, you acknowledge that you've been made aware that Sienna intends to focus on her career and has no intention or interest in raising any child that might result from said consensual sexual encounter; further, being as the federal law currently bans all abortion, even in the event of rape, incest, or health of the mother, do you agree, that in the event that there was an unwanted pregnancy, that Sienna would have no legal or financial obligation to any child born after the execution of this legally-binding contract? Uh... just to be clear, if I say "no," then we're not having sex, right? Right, okay... then I guess it's... a yes. Fantastic. And just one final provision: if a child is born, you, Mark-- I'm sorry, - what was your full name? - Mark Darren Greer. You, Mark Darren Greer, agree to sole parentage, sole custody, and to maintain any and all financial obligations for said child from his earliest six weeks of pregnancy through - said child's 18th birthday. - Yep, yep, yes. - Whatever, yes. - Okay, this contract is hereby executed. I just need to do a quick retina scan. And if you could just give me a thumbprint here. Yes, and if you could e-sign there. Congratulations, you and Sienna are officially cleared for sex. Have fun, you two. That was a lot. How are you feeling? Still... DTF? Totally. My controller glitched-- two out of three. Mark Darren Greer? Yeah... I'm sorry, do I know you? Hi, um, we met nine months ago. I'm Sienna Campbell's attorney. Sienna... oh, yeah. - Right, what's up? - I'm here to execute the fulfillment of your sex contract. Meet your daughter, Emma.

If any of you are feeling nervous at any time, the Association has provided a little something to help calm your nerves. Now, I'm sure you all have a lot of questions. I hope to answer all of them before the end of this. I'm going to be passing these around. Please take one and pass them back. What's wrong? You don't wanna be left behind, do you? Good girl. You are all doing the right thing. Now... are there any questions? Does it hurt? No. No, it's as close to God as you will ever be. How many times do we get to it? As many times as you can! - What if it doesn't work? - It will work. As women, after our 19th year, our bodies are... as ready as they will ever be. What's that? That... is a very generous donation from the Association. He has accelerated the course, which in turn has given us a 100% success rate in seeding!

Uh, actually I can't get pregnant. Well, the Lord works in mysterious ways. All of these fertility places are like this. Completely baby-obsessed. Obsessed with the mommies, obsessed with the daddies. Knock-knock. Hi, I'm Dr. Lizbeth. Thank you so much for coming in today. Janie, this is my boyfriend Alex. - Hi. - Uh, it's nice to meet you, - Dr. Elizabeth. - Oh, no. It's just Dr. Lizbeth, not "E-lizabeth." That was my grandmother's grandmother. And you two, such a lovely married couple. Oh, actually no, not yet. We've been together almost ten years now. We've just been to so many of our friends' weddings that we decided we should just wait. But somebody did catch the bouquet at the last one, so. I have been married for 20 years to my wonderful husband Luke, and we have three precious babies. That's Kayleigh, Bayleigh, and J.C., our boy. Named for Jesus Christ but also my favorite member of NSYNC. But don't tell my husband that! Seriously, don't. Um, you have a lovely family, Doctor, but we are not quite ready for that yet. Oh, but what are you two waiting for? A stork delivery? 'Cause I've got some bad news for you... he's retired! - He's retired! - Yeah. I see here we have 13 gorgeous babies. Gorgeous, huh? Must get it from me. Um, actually they're frozen embryos, they aren't babies. Oh. We are actually here, um, because of this letter you sent. Was there an issue with our payment-- Oh, no-no-no, nothing-- nothing like that. We are part of a new program that protects every child in the state from day one to heaven above. I was particularly touched when I read your file, Janie. You had breast cancer in your 20s? That is so incredibly sad. Yeah, that's the reason we froze embryos to begin with. We weren't even sure if we were going to use them. Just wanted to, you know, keep our options open. Actually we've been thinking about adoption, maybe? I don't know, surrogacy just seems so stressful. Such a silly idea when you've already been so blessed. Nobody wants to go through all that adoption paperwork. Boo, paperwork's the worst, right? Plus, you're already starting a family. A family of 15. That's gonna be a lot of diapers. Again, they're frozen embryos. They are not babies. And it was made very clear to us that, during the process, we would actually have - to discard several embryos. - Ssh! You don't want your precious babies to hear you. Life begins at conception. And that includes the embryonic form. Just like your 13 precious, little... babies. Thank you so much for your time, Doctor, but we actually have got to get going. Thirteen... precious lives put at risk, all for your sinful and reckless lifestyle. Okay, like she said, we're leaving. - What the hell is this?! - Unfortunately, Janie, we will be arresting you today on 13 charges of child abuse and neglect, 13 charges of attempted baby-killing-- What the fuck are you talking about?! - They aren't children! - Maybe you should've prayed more before the devil cursed you with all that cancer for your sins.

Why don't you tell me what's going on with you today? Uh, I finished my book today. That's great, sweetie. And all my friends are coming. I'm officially a teenager. Feliz Cumpleaños to me! That's great, sweetie. He doesn't listen, and I told him what kind to get, and he got me the wrong one again. I feel like I'm walking around in a diaper. You'll be all right, sweetie. Why did he ask me to meet his parents if he was just gonna break up with me? You'll be all right, sweetie. Gosh, say something else. - You'll be-- - Stop, please. Say something real. I just want you to talk to me! Really. I'm not allowed, Gabi. Please? You'll be all right, sweetie. Es tuya, Gabi. Okay, but I haven't touched it in years. No lo tienes que usar, pero no tiene - sentido aquí. - You don't get it. Okay, it won't hurt if you take it. It does! It does hurt me, Dad. Every time I look at that, I think of all the ways that you weren't there for me. All the times that you let a government contractor be my parent when you didn't feel like it. You never fucking felt like it! Gabi, this is what they gave us. And... I was doing my best. It wasn't enough. Not even close. Gabi! Gabi! What's, uh... what's in the box? I guess Dad's moving out of his house. Sent me the last of my things. Feliz Cumpleaños to me. Gabi? I-I didn't think you would be allowed. Oh, they stopped monitoring our line years ago. Told me to disconnect it, but I didn't. I should have... Guess their plan did not work, huh? I'm so sorry, I always wanted to say more, to be better for you. Why'd you do it? I got to have my abortion years ago. I always knew I didn't want children, but... there's a curiosity there. Even in the certainty. And I guess I thought I... I thought I was helping. Why did you pick it up again? Oh, I, um... I guess my dad is... is moving, and... You guess? We're not close. He picked up the phone once. - Really? - I couldn't say anything to him, but he... he talked. If it means anything to you now, he cared for you so very much. He was trying very hard to do right by you. I, um... I'm pregnant. Do you... Do you want to... Yeah. Yeah, I do. I, um... I have a partner, and... he's good, and we're ready. I just... um... my... my mom wanted her baby too. Her second baby. And it just, it went wrong, and they wouldn't help her. And I'm just-- I'm scared that, that, what if it's genetic, you know? what if-what if it goes wrong for me too? And they won't help me and... I don't want to die for this. But I'm scared that they're gonna make me. Gabi... oh, Gabi... you'll be all right, sweetie. Braintree, March 31, 1776. I wish you would ever write me a letter half as long as I write you. Mm, I long to hear that you have declared an independence, and by the way, in the new code of laws, which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies... and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. April 14th, 1776, as to your extraordinary code of laws... I cannot but laugh. We've been told that our struggle has loosened the bands of government everywhere, that, uh, children and apprentices were disobedient, that schools and colleges were grown turbulent, that Indians slighted their guardians and Negroes grew insolent to their masters. But your letter was the first intimation that another tribe, more numerous and powerful than all the rest, were grown discontented. This is rather too coarse a compliment, but you are... so saucy, I won't blot it out. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands. Remember, all men would be tyrants if they could. If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion. And we'll not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation. That your sex are naturally tyrannical is a truth so... thoroughly established as to admit of no dispute, but such of you as wish to be happy willingly, give up the harsh title of master. For the more tender and endearing one of friend. Put it out of the power of the vicious and the lawless to use us with cruelty. Men of sense in all ages abhor these customs which treat us only as the vessels of your sex. We know better than to repeal our masculine systems. Although they are in full force, you know they are little more than theory. We dare not exert our power in its full latitude. We are obliged to go fair and softly... and in practice, you know that we are the subjects. Regard us then as beings placed by providence under your protection, and in imitation of the supreme being, make use of that power only for our happiness. I long to hear that you have declared an independency. And by the way, in the new code of laws, which I suppose it will be necessary for you to make, I desire you would remember the ladies. And be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Finally, you've made the decision to take control of your life. ...wink! You've made the decision to choose Plan C, the only birth control approved - by the federal government. - Tell me more! Waah! Unlike previous forms of contraception outlawed by the court... Plan C has no side effects, well, unless you count a clear complexion, carefree weight loss, and my favorite side effect... copious coitus. Plan C gave me a choice, and lucky for me, I chose him. Commitment. Thanks to Plan C, I'll always be committed to my partner, from when we eat to when we make love... ...we're always in sync. Always. Plan C combines state of the art drone technology with the latest in nano-robotics, to create an intra-uterine device more advanced than ever before. Your doctor inserts the device vaginally, and after a simple cognitive test, aligns the system... ...with the complimentary app. Just a simple in-office procedure-- simple in-office procedure-- And you're set, for life. And when you're ready for that next step, just tell your doctor, and once he-- or she has confirmed you're eligible, they painlessly adjust the settings so you can conceive. Commitment, choice, control. Contraception that works. That's why I chose Plan C. ♪ Plan C, the only plan for me ♪ Talk to your doctor to see if Plan C is right for you! God, I hate that song. Your legally-required viewing is complete; do you have any more questions before you consent to Plan C? Will it hurt? When you put it in? Yes. Hurts a lot. Do you still consent? Yeah, can we do it today? Like, right now? ♪ Plan C, the only plan for me ♪ - Hey, Jodie. - Hey, Carla. - Hey, come on in, hey, y'all. - Hey. You good? Go on in. - How much time we got today? - I've only got, like, - 20 minutes. - My next shift is - across town. - I've got ten. - What, no Della? - She's doing a triple today. What? Fuck, okay. All right, that's enough. You gotta get up, get dressed, get your ass out the door. No one's coming for us. You gotta go to one job and then the next job and then the next job, and you look forward. One day at a time, okay? Just one day at a time. I smell like bleach. Ugh, here, let me take this. I know you don't wanna hear that, but you don't have any other choice, none of us do. ...get to see each other. I miss you too. I miss you too. - Thank you. - I'm gonna see you tonight. I'm gonna see you tonight, okay? I miss you. You don't got to worry. No, it's gonna be okay, I can tell you that - from experience, honey. - I'm scared. - I know. - That's normal. For your safety. You can trust us, you're safe. Just go with it. I can't do it, I can't do it. You got to harden yourself now, you hear me? Catch the bus, make the beds, feed the mouths, grow the babies, birth the babies, raise the babies. Work. And when you feel like you're gonna break, you come here. We'll get you cleaned up, we'll get you dressed every day, if we have to. I wish it wasn't this way, honey... but it is. Okay? Okay? Okay. License and registration? Thank you. Do you know why I pulled you over today? No, officer, I do not. Uh, you were using the carpool lane despite being one single solitary person. Oh, well, actually, I am driving for two. - Oh! - Just a few months. Cool, well, points for creativity, and congratulations, but that doesn't count so I'm still gonna have to ticket you. Oh, well, you definitely don't have to. Um, you could just let me off with a warning. Legally, there are two of us, please? I really can't handle a $250 ticket right now. - It's $490. - What?! Oh, my God, no, I definitely can't-- Okay, don't fall into the victim role here, all right? God has a plan for you, Jenna. And single moms have made it work since the beginning of time. You got this. You can't force me to have a baby and pay a speeding ticket. It's not actually a speeding ticket-- Whatever! It's all part of God's plan, okay? The burden is heavier on us as women, but that's because we're stronger. He never gives us challenges that we can't overcome. I mean, suicide's a thing. Yeah, that's that victim mentality, it'll kill ya, that's what I'm saying. Usually I just take a photo and it auto-populates but-- So, you think that this is a baby. - Yeah. - Well, then you can't possibly write me up for driving with my baby. I can, uh, and I am. Except, menu, it's not-- oh, it's loading. All right, just gotta wait for it to-- might take a second. Have you seen the new season of "Ozark"? It's good. - Ahh, we're back. - Stop writing that. Hey, I said stop writing. I'm gonna need you to stay in your vehicle. Look, a ticket is no big deal, but threatening an officer, - that's a big deal. - Yeah, you're right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. But, look, I am really struggling right now. I could really please just use the tiniest bit of kindness. - Please. - I get it. I don't wanna be a mom, that seems really hard. But that's why I keep my legs closed. It's pretty straightforward, you know, I mean, for the future, too late now, but... You have heard of rape, right? - One in six American women-- - If a baby isn't meant to be born, the body will reject it. Isn't that amazing? It's all in God's hands. Oh, yeah, then what about that ticket? Is that in God's hands? 'Cause that looks - like that's in your hands. - Oh, hey. I got a gun, right? So we're gonna calm down. I understand that you're hormonal, but you gotta relax and get back inside the vehicle. What is gonna happen when I can't pay my rent because of that ticket? And what if it's God's plan that I miscarry him, and I get charged with murder? It's scarier than that gun. Okay, you know, when a dog is about to be euthanized, it's very sad, none of us like it, but they have to do it sometimes. But occasionally it outsmarts the human and hides in a corner or escapes. Usually, even when they find the dog, they grant the dog a stay, right, because the thinking is, well, maybe that dog is destined to live, right? Just gotta think about a baby like that. I am not a violent person, but I do mean you bodily harm. I'm gonna need you to get back in the car. Oh, fuck. Hey, hey, it's okay, it's okay. We're just gonna write you this one ticket. I'm not gonna cuff you or anything, you can handle one ticket, okay? Let's try to... Oh... okay. That was... it's a bit like trying to pat your head and rub your belly at the same time, you know what I mean? Oh, that was close, but that's what I'm saying is it's all part of-- Hey. Hey, beautiful. What's your name? What's your name? Nothing? Hey, beautiful? I'm trying to talk to you. Huh. Fuckin' rude. - Bitch. - Hey, Mister. Want to play backseat bingo? Okay, silent treatment. Hey, beautiful! Nothing? Hey, Mister! ♪ I need a playboy ♪ ♪ Super smash game boy, send a dick pic... ♪ Previously on "Crucible Island"... I can't wait to find out why we're here, okay? For two reasons, one, 'cause Henny-thing is possible, baby. And two, if there's a cash prize, I'm gonna use that as seed money for my staplecoin startup. Fingers crossed that this is a home renovation show. People think moving a palm is just like moving any other tree, but it takes a... a real gentle touch. I have some medical bills piling up. Just a... sorcery mishap. Heh, so I could definitely use the cash to make those, um-- ts-ts-ts-tsah! Disappear. I'm just hoping this is a springboard to get my brand out there. I'm not eating no bug though. Honestly, I guess I'm really here - just to find love. - Love. Or a new assistant. Hello, hello, hello. Seems you've all settled in. I bet everyone is dying to know why you're all here. Let's go ahead and call this lovely lady Bernadette. Right? Oh, man, if this is what we're working with, I'm hella excited. Oh, I'm glad I tanned my balls for this. Ooh, she is really smokin'. Now, Bernadette has just come back from the doctor, and we can confirm she is with child. We brought you five here to deduce which of you heathens put Bernadette in the family way. ...dada. Now, once the lucky impregnator is rooted out, he will leave the house a father! Or with an 18-year financial commitment to pay child support. Okay, are you ready, Bernadette? I have never seen this woman before. I don't even know a Bernadette. This is unacceptable. I refuse to speak unless my lawyer is present. Ruthie, please bring in Geoff's contract, highlighting articles 37, 42, and 68.9. There's this one, this one... Well, that's settled. Get some sleep, boys. Tomorrow, you face judgment in the Reckoning Round. I have so many bills going on! What about my staplecoin startup? Geoff, how many women have you slept with this year to date? One. My wife. Oh. Oh, well, seems we have some studio callers claiming that is perjurious. Ruthie? You have a fucking wife? Does she paint you with hummus? You told me you loved me this morning. Look at you. So many followers. How many of these women have you slept with? - Henny. - April-May June. That's me-- Henny, have you had sex with women or a woman in the last five months? Uh, yes, I-I have, yeah, you know. - Just one, though. - Oh, one's enough. Were you safe when you did this? I think so. Braden's been bragging about tail since we got here. He's your guy. It wasn't me. I always pull out. Pointing fingers at others is always the best line of defense. Geoff, have you ever paid for someone to have a secret abortion? Never. The Wisdom Round. Where do a woman's eggs come from? Her hoo-hoo. Um... God? No, but you are all still in the game. Question number two, how is an embryo created? Through alcohol and mistakes, am I right? I know this one. The fallopian tubes. It's not, it's not, it's not the fallopian tubes. Question number three, can you name the female reproductive hormones? Is the answer boobs? Potassium. Science, brah. Well, this is an abomination. Hi, uh, April-May June. So, obviously I don't know much about reproductive stuff, and... being here has made me realize that I haven't been the best guy, but seeing Bernadette, I'm, like, starting to feel things that I've never felt before. So, I just wanna say, if it was me, I accept full responsibility. Wow, thank you, Henny. Bernadette, is Henny the father? No! Well, Henny, you are not the father. But your willingness to take accountability for your actions has been noted. So, Henny, you have been released from your witch hunt. Your time on "Crucible Island" has officially come to an end. Thank you. Henny-thing is possible, guys. He really was the only one of you I liked. Our expert will monitor your polygraph units, so no lies. Welcome to the alibi round. Geoff, where were you on the night of March 17th? I was home with my wife. - Where I always am. - Well, that's great. Let's see if Mrs. Geoff can corroborate. Let's get her on the line, Ruthie. Hi, April-May, as much as I don't wanna help this narcissistic small- - boy loser, we were at home that night waiting for a couch delivery. There's ring-cam footage. As usual, Geoff was rude to the delivery guys. Serve him, Abigail! Hey, Lindy, wait, please, I-- Eh, yeah, we lost her. All right, Geoff, you're not the father. Well, you have officially been released from your witch hunt. Your time on "Crucible Island" has come to an end. Now get the fuck out. I lost, and then I won, and that's politics. We are down to three. So, who's the culprit? Is it Braden? Is it Marco? Is it Keith? You have three seconds to answer this question, Braden, where were you on the night of March 17th? You're gonna need to be quicker, okay, moving on to Marco. March 17th, St. Paddy's Day. I was with my frisbee golf team, chugging pitchers on a parade float. Hah! I was on a parade float. Did you have sex? Nah... - yeah. - Oh, my fucking God. why are we believing Mr. Dick-Every-Girl-Down? It's obviously fucking Braden. Why me? Huh? Why not magic man here? He conjures. I mean, I guess he can conjure a babe who fuckin' knows-- then he can conjure another girl. Oh, what the fuck, Keith, Braden literally calls himself a clit whisperer. 'Cause it's fuckin' true. - Mm-hmm. - Fuckin' Braden. Fuck you, pipsqueak. Maybe it's you, fuck you! Shall we let the final three in on our little secret? Before you were brought here, Bernadette decided she was not ready to be a mother. Not emotionally, not mentally, not financially. She went ahead and made the terminal decision to have an illegal abortion, and her actions resulted in her immediate arrest and pending prosecution. Fuck yeah. Now, in the good old US of A, we have a saying. Ruthie, can you tell us what the saying is? It takes two to tango. And once we expose whomever was the reputed father, he too will face manslaughter charges alongside Bernadette! - What? - She will not tango alone. I can't go to jail for a hookup. It's time for the Persecution Round. Let's turn our inquiry over to the home tribunal. Folks at home, call 555-1111 to let us know who you denounce. - Go ahead, caller. - I'm pretty sure Braden did it, he just looks like a piece of shit. - Who the fuck is this? - I'm just a self-righteous asshole that has now been emboldened by the patriarchy and legally enabled to impose my narrow-minded morality on anyone I damn well please. So, your word or mine, stranger. ...that's fucking insane. Next caller claims to have a connection to one of you! Hi, I'm the HR rep that hired Marco for our corporate retreat. He swore he could make the underwriters disappear, but instead, he made my underwear disappear. Every last pair. Even when I bought new ones. I mean, he is a good magician, but he's definitely a perv. - Abracadabra, loser. - Oh, you're so damn smug. When did you get that T-shirt, spring break? Yes, actually. Daytona, where I got COVID for the whole month of March. I was bedridden the entire time I was there. Keith, you evade punishment. Keith-It-Reals, you are released from your witch hunt. Your time at "Crucible Island" has come to an end. - Later, bozos. - Fuck off. And then there were two. Find out who gets raked over the fiery coals of feticide next time on "Crucible Island."

Join us. ...would be a monumental decision, and we are at the capitol of the last holdout state to keep pro-choice abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade over a decade ago on June 24th, 2022. The state has become a battleground for the pro-life movement and politicians. Today, the governor is due to sign the ratification presented by the state senate. The announcement could be the end of this process, which has since led to-- the banning of abortion rights in 49 states. As we wait for the decision, let's go to other-- ...we are looking out for the unborn. Mainstream media want you to believe that we aren't pro-women! Being pro-life and pro-women's rights aren't mutually exclusive! Oh, God... oh, you can do it. You can do it. Is some... Is someone there? Juanita, mi amor, cuídate, por favor. No. Hey, Vi. Lookin' bien as usual. Heh, Officer Hall. Uh, been busy today. Huh. - That's all right. - Yeah. I have time. Time. Ahh, see, this girl has the whole department crazy. You know, I had to work OT last night because we got a tip that she was, you know, seen a few miles from here. I... I hope she's okay. Where's your... your little helper? Um... Juanita, she took the day off. She went to the capitol. Ahh, Juanita. I just hope she's on the right side of this mess. You know, it can be... muy malo. Coffee's ready. Ahh. Café con leche. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly it. - That's how I like it. - Mm. Mmm. Too strong? Uh, nah, nah, nah, it's fine. It's just fine. - Thanks, Vi. - Mm-hmm. - What's up? - You're not gonna believe this. Oh, my gosh. - Is that-- - We can't. - We are fucked. - I mean, if she makes it, what's stopping her from ratting us out? This is the job. Please help me. Hang on. Thank you. Okay. It's okay. You made it. We want to help you. Shit. Ssh. Shit... por favor, no se vayan, don't go anywhere. I'm stupid, I was, um, I was in the back. - You know-- - That's all right. - I left my glasses. - Ahh. Ahh, there. Now, I know you don't keep these cameras just to keep an eye on an empty store. Yeah. "We have a moral duty to disobey an unjust law." Our friend said that. Breaking news, this just in, a decision has been reached in the landmark pro-choice case in the last state currently fighting to uphold abortion rights in the country. Let's go live from the state capitol, where the governor is about to announce... I know I'm not hearing you right. Come on, really? I-I love you, Junie, but this is not - what's best for you. - Okay, um... You know what's best for me and my body, right? All right, no, that's not what I'm saying, - and you know it. - Marco, you've been begging me for years - to be a cool uncle. - Yeah, I wanna be a cool uncle to a normal kid. What's that supposed to mean, hm? IVF is perfectly normal. It's not. Do you even know what this procedure is? Okay, I-I did research, okay? It's not IVF, it's your stem cells. What does that even mean? This is the government doing what they always do... Goodbye, Marco, goodbye. It's, it's... Uncle SAM's IVF Program, how can I help you? Hi, yes, Juniper Stone. January 15, 1993. I need Dr. Evka immediately. Please hold. How are you feeling, dear? Something's wrong. I woke up this morning, and... - my stomach... - It's perfectly fine. This is expected. This is normal. I am with you. I see you. I wouldn't let anything happen. It's very distended. I'm concerned. Should I go to the hospital? Right now, your stem cells are fertilizing and growing exponentially. As per the process, that was explained to you in your contract. Unless you did something that you were instructed not to do. Yes, no-- of course not. We are monitoring you. Have you been missing your injections? Communicating outside of the designated connection window? I don't know why I'm so bad at that. We are the future, and the future is perfect. Thank you, Dr. Evka. You've reached Juniper Stone, CEO of Rhino Group Media. Please leave a message after the beep. Junie? Please, please, please check out the article I sent you. Call me back. Bye. Hey, it's Kat. Um, my wife's in the same IVF group as you, and she's acting really weird. Are you okay? This is Lisa from Dr. Evka's office. I'm calling to remind you that you're in a closed communication portion of your incubation period. Dr. Evka's office, please? This is wrong. Something is wrong. I... I saw something. Saw something? Do we have to do mental health re-evaluation? No. That's what I thought, dear. Our bodies are built for this. This new life, it's a whole new you. A better you. You are going to make an incredible mother. Thank you, Dr. Evka. Now, you just have to let her out. How are you feeling, dear?
