Coffee? Coffee, huh? - Hello. Coffee? - Yes. Coffee? I need to go to the restroom, honey. This seat is already taken. Your mother has got a new seat. - Hello. Want some coffee? - No, thanks. - Coffee? - No, thanks. Coffee for you? No, thanks. Do you remember this pipe? This is for you, Daddy. For me? Thank you, sweetheart. It's very beautiful. Thank you, sweetheart. It belongs to my father. Sorry. The use of mobile phones is not allowed on airplanes. I know. Yes, I remember. How could I forget your birthday, Gud? Really? All right. I got to get back to work now. You're with that girl, right? Here. Why don't you talk to your daddy? Hurry up. - Hurry up. - Hello. Papa, it's me, Miki. Are you all right? Papa! Miki! Don't hurt my daughter! You want coffee? I don't want it! Tell me... where you keep it or I'll kill your daughter. Give it back to your father. Papa! Why are you making me a buffalo? I'm not a buffalo! Come here. You midget! Come here. No. I don't know anything at all. I'm just a passenger. I'm here with my husband. I saw people fighting and wanted to poke my nose into it. Then, I somehow got hit. I don't know anything. You talk too much! I dare you to say "I don't know" again. I don't know. You don't know, huh? - You wench! - I'm sorry, Mommy. Miki! Are you okay? You all are useless. I told you to get that important stuff but you're back with a stupid box. Why did you bring me a picture of a kid? You too! King Kong. I told you to bring that girl. And where is she now? She's in the picture, Boss. See? In the picture? What about the upcoming auction? The customers have already placed the order. How are we going to deliver the goods? The Chai Lais always meddle in our business. Those bimbos again? Yes, sir. It nearly cost me my life to get this box from the Japanese guy. Boss... Besides the Chai Lais have you noticed that we have always blundered? You'll know why when you look out there. National Police Bureau I look at it all the time. Burn it down! Are you sure? The entire bureau? Still in the meeting? When you're done, I need to talk to you. I think I know how we could get that stuff. International Police Headquarters Have you found out where Dragon and his gang are having the auction? We've been tracking them. I think we'll get a lead soon. How about you two? I've also heard about their upcoming auction. Tell you what. If I have any progress, I'll let you know. By the way, on my flight back home, I met someone. She's very lovely. A flight attendant or a passenger? A flight attendant. Seriously, I've never seen a girl this charming in my life. Her flat nose is so adorable. Chai Lai Headquarters It's okay to fail... on your first mission. Don't let me down next time, Rose. Always think twice and keep your temper in check. Be patient and prudent in everything you do. With experience, you'll learn how to solve problems. Fortunately, they couldn't get Miki. Otherwise, you're all in deep trouble. She's the one who holds the secret of the Andaman Pearl. I want you to do your best to protect her. Don't let her out of your sight especially when she's in school. Lotus will disguise as a teacher. Got it. Teacher? What does it mean? One who stands in front of the blackboard. The one who teaches students! Spadix. You'll be a Tuk-Tuk driver guarding the school vicinity. Can't I drive a Ferrari instead, Boss? We don't have the budget. Let's just go with a Tuk-Tuk. Rose will be a stall vendor in front of the school. How could a high-society girl like me be a stall vendor? You sweetest thing! Fine. It's up to you. You can be anything you like as long as you do your job. All right. So, Pouy-sian, you'll disguise as a food vendor. Yes, sir. - Hibiscus. - Yes? With your hillbilly face, you're perfect for the maid role. What! A maid? Can't you use my beauty to do something else? What did she just say? Boss, if you don't understand, nobody will. All right. Say no more. You'll be a maid. Call it whatever you like. A servant, a nanny or whatever. Doesn't make much of a difference. - Yes, sir. - Get to the mission! - What? - The mission! All right. I'll take care of it. Boiled peanuts and sweet potatoes! Pouy-sian. The school entrance is clear. Rose calling Spadix. Rose calling Spadix. Rose? Rose who? It's me, the beautiful Rose. I see. And what's your status? You can always count on me. Everything is fine. Good to hear that. I can finish doing my makeup now. Who cares about your makeup? Geez! My face is so oily. Hey! Who's got a moustache? Nobody else is here. Oh, it's me. There she is. - How is she doing? - She's always a good girl. Very good girl. Hey! Catch that girl. Hey, Hibiscus! Hey! Come on. Move. Here. Come on. Hold her! Hey! Hey, let go. Hey! Quick! You creep! How dare you kick my face? No! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Get up! Hurry! Come on. Let me go! Let me go! Come on! Get in! Let me go. Hey! No! Hey! Pouy-sian! Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Darn! Pouy-sian! Give me your hand, Pouy-sian. Hold it tightly. Give me your hand. Pouy-sian! Come on. Pouy-sian! Give me your hand. Come on. Come on, Pouy-sian! Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Come on. The truck is coming towards us! Come on. Pouy-sian! Rose, get closer. Chase them from behind. I'll cut in. Lotus, fire warning shots with your gun. Lotus... - Stop. - What's next? Don't let them get away. Hit it! Let me go. No. Don't shoot. No! Don't shoot! Pouy-sian! Rose! Miki. Hibiscus! Hold on. Hold tight. Hibiscus, jump! Come on. I got you. Jump, Hibiscus. Come on. Jump. Don't block my view. I can't see the road. Watch out! No. Get to the seat. Come on. Come on. Down here. It's too far. Come on. I got you. Quick. No! You don't know who you're messing with! Don't step on me. It's dirty. Grab her! Hang on, Miki. Miki! Hurry up! Jump! Lotus. Stop! Stop right there! What the heck? I'm in a hurry. I'm in a hurry, too! Sorry. Let's go! Let's go! Stay still... You're such a pain in the butt! Moron! What was that kick for? I'm sorry, man. What the hell were you doing? You wimps can't even handle a little kid? Get up! Go get her. Kiddo. Do you love your mummy? Your mummy is here too. Just tell me the secret. No, I won't. Fine. Bring her mummy here. Yes, sir. How do I look? Any more makeup and you'll look like a zombie. I think it's good. I look like I'm hurt bad. Show me how you're hurting. Come on. Pretend to be sad. Make it look painful. That's it. Mrs Mei Ling, you're awesome. The boss wants to see you, Mrs Mei Ling. We're all set. Here goes! Just tell him where your daddy's treasure is, Miki. No, I won't. Please tell him. - No, I won't. - Tell him. Are you going to tell me or not? - No. - You're not going to talk, huh? If you won't tell us... Are you going to tell now? - No. - You're still not telling? Don't hurt my mum! Come here. Don't you care for your mother anymore? Tell me where it is. Miki... Miki, please tell him. Please tell him... - No way. - Please tell him. Take this kid and lock her in the room. You're still not telling me, huh? Mummy! - Mummy! - Miki. Mummy! Mummy! Please tell him. Why is it so difficult to get her to spill the beans? I want to go to the spa. Be patient. I'll have somebody take you to the spa, okay? What's the matter with you? You can't even protect a little kid. What else can you do then? Boss, this is our plan. We're sending a cub into the cave. Sending a cub into the cave? I've never heard of it. What are you up to? It's a part of our plan, Boss. We let them capture Miki on purpose. No. It won't work. Keep an eye on Mei Ling and Dragon. I was told they're working together. Do you know that Miki is Mei Ling's stepdaughter? How could I be your boss if I don't know about that? We have a plan. A plan? What plan? A plan called "luring the snakes into the hole". "Luring the snakes into the hole"? Fine, go get those snakes into the hole. Miki, use what I taught you only when necessary. Do not use it to harm innocent people. If something happens to me, you must obey your stepmother. Even though she's not your birth mother. I want you to love her just like I do. More importantly, Miki... you must protect the Andaman Pearl because it's very crucial to keep the ocean calm. Do not let anyone take it away from Mother Nature. If it loses its energy, our world will be in jeopardy. Be a good girl. I love you, sweetie. If you slap my face like that again, I'll rip your face apart! I just did what Master Dragon told me to do. If I didn't slap you, nobody would believe us. Can you lower your voice? Everyone can hear what you're saying. Nobody is going to hear us. Did you two hear what we just said? No, Madam. Very nice. That means we've kept our voices down. I heard it with my own two ears. Two snakes are crawling ahead. The third one is about to get into the hole. What is going into the hole? Nothing. The snake is getting into the hole. Copy that. Pouy-sian... Where are you going, wretched liar? I've been thinking about you. You miss me? Very much! Then talk to my bodyguard. But I want to talk to you! Kill them. Hey! Here they come! You wretched wench. What a stupid faggot! What a humongous broad! Help me up. Thank you. You're welcome. Kill them. Come on. Put on the towel for me. Did you think you could beat me? Catch me if you can... Chai Lai! Where are you going? Get back here. Nice to see you again, midget. Surprise! Ogre! How could an ogre be this gorgeous? Why don't you shoot me instead? As you wish! Catch him. Thanks a lot. No! Spadix! No! Spadix! No. We can't kill him before we know where Miki is. I told you not to get on my nerves! Look! He's not dead yet. Let's get him! Come on. Hurry up. Darn it. King Kong, get in. Don't let him get away. Get him! Those darned Chai Lais are getting more and more annoying. Not only are they annoying, but they're also destructive. Don't worry about it, Boss. I've hired the five-nation bounty hunters to finish them off. Good! Take them out! Hello. Earth, is that you? This is me. Hold on a second. Wait! Where are you going, Rose? I'm meeting Gud. It's his birthday. Got to go now. How do I look? Fabulous. - Hold on. - What? Have a great time! That's for sure. See you. Hi, Rose. You almost missed my birthday. But I always make it, don't I? Happy birthday. Will you marry me? Yes... - What's wrong? - I can't breathe. I'm going to die. What? If I can't marry you. Will you marry me? Rose, I've just found a job. Really? What kind of job? Working in a bank. My salary is 8,000 baht a month. Really? I can take care of you from now. I promise. I'll take care of you. How's your job coming along? It's kind of busy. What kind of job do you do? You never told me. You'll find out one day. Rose, are you going to marry me? Yes. I should get going. - Gud. - What? Happy birthday. Thank you. I really got to go. Good night. I'm getting married! What's wrong? You were dancing like a crazy pony. Why did you turn it off? I was just getting into the mood. You still haven't told us. I'll be getting married soon. Gud just proposed to me. Are you sure that he really loves you? Absolutely! He loves me and I love him. We love each other. Talking about men always gets Lotus down. Unlike me. I think I'll quit being a Chai Lai. Are you sure? Gud! - Get up! - Gud! Gud! Let him go! Didn't you hear me? Do you remember what you did to my eye? You're so much in love, right? Gud! Hang in there. Rose, take Gud out of here! Where's Hibiscus? Pouy-sian, come with me. They are too many of them. This way. Hibiscus, stop being a greedy pig. They're coming to get us. - Who? - Dragon's henchmen! - What? - Come on. Quick. - What are you looking for? - Weapons. Let's go! This is not the time to eat. Jump! Jump, Pouy-sian! Gud, climb down into the pool. I'll be right there. Easy now. Here we are. All right. Sit here. Meow! Should we finish them off now, Boss? No, not yet. We have to wait. Get down! Gud, hang in there! Gud. Rose. You idiot, Rose! Your time has come. Kill her! Lotus. I think I'd better go help Rose. I'm kind of worried about her. All right, you be careful. - I'll take care of the rest. - Okay. Gud, hide. Go! It's very dangerous here. Gud! Gud. Gud. Come on! Get angry! Get angry now! How dare you grope my butt? Now, I'm angry! Hey, negro. Why is he so slippery? What stinky breath! You don't know who you're messing with. Spadix. Spadix. Gud. Spadix. Help me! Rose. Spadix. Pouy-sian. Pouy-sian. Let's go! Where are you bimbos going? Cage them! You think you're so tough, huh? This time, all of you will be dead like rats. No, you're dead! Yeah? So, why don't you come out? Come closer and I'll kick your butt. Kathleen. - Gud. - Hibiscus? Where's Hibiscus? Hibiscus. - Hibiscus. - Turn left. Turn left. You're all going to die! - You're all going to die! - Turn left. Shoot them! Shoot! Is she going to miss like last time? I hope not. Yes! That's it. It was close. I knew it. She missed again. Hibiscus. Turn left... Shoot them...! Shoot them! Go straight ahead. Stop. Turn the barrel to the right and shoot! Right. To the right... And shoot! Come on. Shoot them. Come on. Come on. Shoot them. I know how we can get out of here. Grope my butt. Not you! Him! Gud, touch her butt. Touch it. Darn! You're touching my breasts! Stop... Come on. Come on. Hurry. Get him. Come on. Gud... Look. This is my masterpiece. Who is he? Rose's boyfriend. You can't be that stupid, can you? We need baits to lure the tigers out of the cave. And he's our bait. Are you getting smarter now, Boss? And who the hell is this freak? She's my trump card. Drag him out here. Kathleen. - Cut his finger off. - Yes, madam. His finger, not mine. I'm sorry, madam. I'm right here. Is this what you called "smart", King Kong? Open the door. Gud! What's wrong? I had a nightmare. You must be very worried about Gud. He'll be fine. Trust me. Rose. Your man is so rough. Look. He made my butt swell but only on one side. Stop laughing, Lotus. Shame on you. Look what you've done! Only one of my breasts is swollen. Why did you squeeze only one side? Want me to squeeze the other one too? You crazy girl! By the way, it's not a bad idea. For you. What is it? It's a human finger. It must be Gud's finger. Gud's finger? Why do you have to say that? It's not Gud's finger. But the ring... - It's his ring. - Yeah, sure. Sure it is! You're sure, huh? Ouch! It hurts. Hibiscus, your tank man is here. What are you ladies doing? We're just chatting. Nothing much. - Here. - Thank you. I brought it for... That's all right. Thank you very much... He's here to see Rose. Thank you. Are you all right? I'm okay. Thank you. Follow her. Let her be. Since she was born it's the first time a man has given her flowers. I don't think we should fall in love with anyone. Do you remember my wedding day? Do you accept this man to be your husband? No, you don't! Sam. Yeah. I agree with you. We aren't supposed to love anyone. All our loved ones ended up in tragic death. I think I should break up with Gud. I don't want to see him dead. Good for you. For us Chai Lais, our mission is everything. Wait a minute! Well, I'm in a different situation. My boyfriend and I love each other. We don't have any problems like yours. I'm almost 10 years older, yet we could still have a love story. Is it a love story or a stinky one? Look! Right on time! Let me see what he just sent. Mr. Somsak wants to see us. Mr. Somsak... Boss! Boss! Where is he? A message. Just turn on the iPod. And you will see the command. Tony Jeng. I was informed that our spy would take action tonight. Rose, Lotus, Pouy-sian. Don't let the cub out of your sight. Spadix and Hibiscus. Follow every step Mei Ling takes in Bangkok. All the information is in the book behind the iPod. Commence the operation. Now. Boss! He could've just given us a call instead of getting us to make a trip here. Don't you know our boss keeps up with trends? Look at her face and you'll know. She has a modern look? Okay. Let's get to work. Hey, what's your name? I'm Miki. Do you know Rose? That means you know the Chai Lais, right? Yes, I do. Could you give this banknote to the Chai Lais? Could you give this banknote to the Chai Lais? Give it to them once you get out of here. Take them outside. Move! Hey, kid. Come here. You'd better tell me why this bill is so important. Don't tell him. Just tell him how it's important so he won't hurt me. She's trying to burn it. That means this bill is very important. Just tell him what you know, honey. Please. Please. Hey! The tiger is in the cave now. Let me see. Gud. I thought you wouldn't care about him anymore. I just called out his name, that's all. - Sir. - What? It must be on that island. Come on. Come on. Finally! The Queen of Andaman is in my hand. No! It belongs to my dad. - Come here. - You brat. The Chai Lais. Those damn Chai Lais. They just won't get off my back! Go get them! Come here. Chai Lais! Help me, Chai Lais. Let go. Chai Lais! Help me. Rose. Rose! Rose...! Rose...! How dare they set foot in our turf! I saw them right from the start. Our boss invited them here. Bro, Daddy is here. Your dad got invited too? I mean the police, bro, the police! The bitch is out, and the puppies are in the cage. Everything's fine. Launch the operation. I'd like to thank everyone for coming to the auction this evening. Of course, all of you will see the most precious pearl in the world today. It's the Queen of Andaman. It belongs to my dad. Ladies and gentlemen, let's start the bidding. Who has the business? Who has the highest bid? 50 million! 50 million? 100 million. 100 million? 150 million. 150 million baht. 200 million. 200 million. 1 billion baht. Surprise! No one shall possess this pearl. Papa! Professor. Miki, don't you worry. I'm here to save you. How are you? I'm fine. You cannot sell this pearl. It is to protect the ocean. Get him. The Chai Lais! Your fun time is over. Those who don't want to get involved, leave! Do you hear that? Why are you still standing here? - Get out! - Let's kick their butts. You want to get my boss? Over my dead body! How could you do that? She's pregnant. She's just full of poop. Look at what's in her hand. Benlo. (Herbal medicine to regulate menstruation) Get out! Go! You came at the right time, witches. Rose. What should we do, Boss? Earth, get my kid out of here. Take that girl with us. Do as we planned! You guys stay here. I'll be right back. Wait for me. Follow me. - Let me go. - Darkie, finish them. Papa! Bang...! Hey, what's wrong with you? It's over there! Take it. Come on. - Let go of me! It hurts. - Hibiscus. Hibiscus. Run! Holy moly! Let's go! Hold on. I'm fine. Let's go. Papa! Follow me, sir. Let's get out of here. Let me go. Let me go. - On your feet! - Yes, sir. This way. This way, sir. Here you go, sir. Get the girl in there. Why didn't you tell me you were already in the car? Leave it to me, Boss. You can trust my ability. I trust your ability, but not your eyes. Come on, handsome. - Close the door. - Yes, sir. Don't struggle. Where the heck are you going? Sorry, sir. I forgot. Are you done yet? Let's go. - Come on. - Go! - You're always in my way. - Rose... You're always obstructing my work. Let him go now! I said let him go! Release him. You really love him, don't you? You can't live without love, can you? This is for ruining my plan! Gud! Gud...! Let's go. Mei. Gud... I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for lying to you, Gud. I'm sorry. Don't get mad at me. I'll take care of you. I promise. I'll take care of you. You can't die on me, Gud. Don't you remember your promise? You told me you'd take care of me forever. You can't leave me like this. Stay with me. Don't leave me, Gud. Gud, I'm sorry. Don't leave me. You promised you'd take care of me. You can't leave me like this, Gud. Rose. Rose. Gud. Hey, kid. Tell me how I can take the pearl out of the glass ball. I'm not telling you. - Tell me! - No! - Tell me now! - No! You imbecile. Why the hell did you stop the car? Here we are, sir. You go get her. Yes, Boss. Stop. I said stop. Stop. - Stop! - Stop! Boss. Kong, go get that girl. And meet me on the roof-deck. All right. Stop. Hold it right there. Don't you know who I am? Darn! What took them so long? Chai Lai! You found me. I'm impressed. I didn't come for you. I'm here to retrieve the treasure of Mother Nature. The treasure of Mother Nature? It's my treasure. This is worth billions and I won't let it slip out of my hands. You know what? This Andaman Pearl keeps the ocean calm. You must return it to where it belongs or else it'll gradually lose its energy. When that happens, we'll see a huge explosion. The whole city will be destroyed. Give it back now! Really? An explosion? What a joke! If you want it, come and get it. Go! Wait! Help me get my leg off the railing. I told you not to be so dramatic. Go! Stop kicking, you nasty girl. Catch her! Go get that girl. Yes, Boss. I dropped the gun, Boss. Go pick it up. Yes, Boss. You have the nerve to want to fight me, huh? You're still wet behind the eyes. You mean "ears". You smart aleck! - Have you found it yet? - No, not yet. Where the hell is my gun? Found it yet? If I were rich, I would have my eyes fixed then I'd be able to see properly. What are you holding in your hand? A gun. Kathleen, shoot that kid! Yes, Madam! Kathleen, what have you done? Shoot her, not me! Sorry! My bad! - Shoot! - Okay. Did I get her? You still got me, not her. You want another shot? - Shoot! - Right away! How come she's still alive? Is she dead yet? Not yet! She's running away. Shoot her again. Shoot! Okay. Follow her! Follow her! Okay... I'm going. Thank you all for a job well done. Anyway without the help of my trusted spy this mission couldn't have been accomplished. Ladies, I'd like to introduce you to... Kathleen. Watch your step. Be careful. Beware of the steps, you crazy-eyed woman. Come here. This is my trusted spy. We're getting married soon. Why did you let her get pregnant before you're married? She's not pregnant. It's just her cute little tummy. After our honeymoon I'll find an ophthalmologist to get the surgery done. For her, sir? No, for me! I want my eyes to be just like hers. How could she be a spy? We have absolutely no clue about it. Yeah. I'm a darn good actress, mind you. A good spy must have good focus. Just like Kathleen. I have a new mission for you. I'm sending you to go after Bin Ladin. What? Bin Ladin! And I want you to meet a new member of the Chai Lais. Miki. Hi! Come, my crazy-eyed darling. Don't look at me like that. Let's go. Tonight, I'm going to cure your eyes and make you... Papa, I did everything that you desired to do. Don't worry about me. I'll fight against evil and make this world a better place. May you rest in peace, my beloved daddy. Get ready for the next mission. The Chai Lais in a battlefield. Don't come near me! I have a grenade, see? Kathleen. Throw the grenade! Rock and roll! Charge! Shoot them, Kathleen! Shoot them! Shoot! Back off or you'll be dead. Shoot! Let's go! I fled to the south but you've caught up with me. Kathleen. Miki. Pouy-sian! Miki. Don't give him a chance! Die! Miki, shoot them! Pouy-sian. Keep fighting, Chai Lais!
