Yes. Tell me. - I don't speak. I just do. I've already done Dharamdas work. I've yet to receive the payment. Seems like your enemies have been wiped out. So you don't need me anymore. In our business, enemies are never wiped out in totality Michael. They come and go like guests. I'll send the money through Kalia. Kalia, you'll go this time too to pay him the monay. Hello Michael! Is it the total amount? - You may count the money. Are you surprised? It's your own revolver. After Dharamdas was murdered, we wanted to kill his murdered too.. ..so that the police doesn't receive any evidence. You escaped from us that day. But it's impossible to escape this time around. Bullets are not meant to be kept in the pockets. I spit on your integrity. You call me your friend, and yet aim to stab me from behind. You want to kill me, don't you? Go ahead. Kill me. I'm sparing you simply because you offered me water while in prison. When did you come? - Just a while ago. But how did you guess that I've come? The entire room is filled with the fragrance of my favourite flowers. I can guess from the smell that it's you. Maria! Maria, we should get married now. Michael, my bringing joy in my life... ..wouldn't you be putting your happiness at stake? I'm myself roaming around berett of happiness mAria. My world was so lonely. You changed my entire concept of life. Let me answer the door bell. Who is it Michael? It's my close friend. - I'll fetch tea. I hope you didn't have much trouble in locating the house! Those who're serious they're able to find God too. You're just.. I'm a demon, you mean to say? - Where do you hide yourself? You're not to be seen for months. I won't let you go now. There's so much work to do. I hardly have any time for friends like you. I've brought you an attractive gift. Would you like to have a look at it? The gift is indeed very beautiful. But you should be knowing that I don't accept gifts. Accept it. After all, he's offering it with so much love and affection. Hey, I forgot! Maria, he's my very special friend. And she's Maria. Hello! - Hello! I'm arresting you for the murder of Bakshi Jung Bahadur and Dharamdas. What do you think? Can you catch me? I'll definitely catch you. And put you behind bars too. I used to play a lot of hide-and-seek games in childhood. None was able to catch me. I feel like turning into a child once again. Before you start the game, you had better remember.. ..that I've the strength and stamina to face all your challenges. Don't act smart. Hand over your pistol to Michael. Move! MIchael, you've been lucky today. But always remember that fortunes change without notice. Who is it? The person whom you believe to be Michael's friend.. ..is a police inspector in real life. Michael locked me in this room and went away. I'm concerned about you. I consider it my duty to reveal you the truth. Perhaps you don't know anything about Michael. You consider him to be your well-wisher. But, in really, he's a killer. In fact, you lost your eyesight because of Michael himself. When I told you about Michael that day, I didn't intend to hurt you. My repeated visits to your house do not mean that.. I want to unearth information about Michael from you. I'm concerned for you. As a brother, I would like to have your eyes operated upon. You should be able to see world again. Maria? I hate you! I hate you Michael! I hate you! You'r killer! Killer killer killer.....! Killer killer killer.....! Killer killer killer.....! You're standing here! What's happened,friend? Has that inspector revealed everything to Maria. What a life I lead! Absolutely third rate! Seems like bad luck wouldn't spare me all my life. When it was time to educate myself, I was rendered homeless. When I grew up, I had weapons instead of degrees and certificates. When I tried tohelp out the poor and destitute.. ..I was jailed, and labelled as Michael killer. The greatest merchant of death. I detest such a life. I detest such a game. When I met Maria, my hopes for a purposeful life were revived. For a purposeful life.. Yet my bad luck refused to let me go. Kalia, Maria lost her eyes because of me. I'll wait till I get her eyes operated upon! Thereafter I'll surrender myself to the police. Don't worry. She'll indeed be operated upon Tuti Shah is finalising a big deal tomorrow. Don't Woory Michael. Luck seems to be favouring Tuti Shah. What's wrong with our own good luck? Why is luck not favouring us? Do I want to earn money for my own sake? Do I want to construct a building for my own sake? Do I want to construct a house for my own sake? No. If I'm desirous of earning wealth, it's for the sake of Maria. For Maria only. Tuti Shah cheated me and escaped. And I couldn't do a thing about it. I could do nothing.... Why're you behaving so abnormally? One has to face uncertainties in the game of life and death. I'm not worried whether we'll win or lose in this game. Even if lose both my eyes in this game, I wouldn't mind. But Maria has to regain her eyeslight. She should see again. Is there any soecific reason why somebody could've assaulted you? My service towards society. That's my biggest crime. But those who fire bullets do not realise that.. ..a man's good deed can brush away death too. I experienced a similar phenomena. - But.. You must've glimpsed the person who fired at you? Neither did I see anybody, nor do I know anyone. You must be having some enemy? - I don't have a enemy. Let's go. I know very well who my enemy is. I'll settle my score on my own, not through police assistance. What happened? - Nothing. Michael has to be eliminated. Summon Teju immediately. This is Michale's photograph. And this is the advance payment. Kill him with caution. If he is saved, you'll be a dead man. I've committed countless murders in my lifetime. You'll receive news of his death too I'm not satisfied with the news of my enemy's death. I would want to see corpse too. I'll slice off his head and send it to you. If you're able to manage it, I'll pay you double the price. You're planning a stage show? For my sake? I don't understand. Whatever amount is collected through thais programme.. ..will be utilised for your eye-operations. I'm deeply emberassed to realise that.. I've become a burden on everybody around me. A sister is never a burden for her brother. Darkness is not long-lived. It'll be sunrise very soon.. ..and you'll be able to see the world as it is. A charity programme is being conducted here. Many people will be coming here. Taking advantage of the crowd, Michael'll come to meet Maria. But Maria wouldn't be present here. We've to arrest Michael with great caution and care. It's possible that Michael might not come there, fearing the police. Michael will definitely come there. Michael will definitely to there. He'll definitely go there. Going there means embracing death. Embracing death is my life. Who ordered you to fire at him? The police was in search of Michael. Why did you have to run? To rescue Michael. My life was his gift to me. I returned it to him. I had not asked for such a heavy price in exchange for friendship. Listen to me attentively. It's a golden chanche to arrest Tuti Shah. With a view to sell innocent and naive girls, Tuti Shah is planning.. ..to send kidnapped girls to foreign lands tomorrow mirning at 11 o' clock. Shall we go? What say? Seems like you've a record for standing. Go and be seated. Take rest. Don't think too much. After all, a parrot is destined to remain imprisoned inthe cage. I've a record of sorts. I've never remained imprisoned in any prison for too long. Your determination is not stronger than my grip over you. I feel so pity for you. This is your age to enjoy and make merry. Perhaps you're not aware.. ..that your law has given rise to us criminals and cheats. It has a network of cheats within this place. By the time you come in contact with one official.. ..another one would've been transferred as swiftly. Who would be bothered to pay heed to you? The law keepers will pacify you with a medal and pack you away. Why do you ruin your life for the sake of law? If sacrificing one's life for the law of the nation.. ..is like ruining one's life in your opinion.. ..I'll be the first person to feel proud of my own ruin. The crumbling sounds that you hear are originating from my bones. Please register an individual report of each of my bones. Who's made such a pathetic state of yours? Please lend me a helping hand. I've done it myself. My wife made a demand for a colour television set today. I too decided to put my moustache's to an acid test! I entered straight into the Golibar hutment dwellings. As soon as they saw me, doors and windows closed in a hurry. Shop shutters were rolled down immediately. I was so happy about it. - Please take care pf yourself. My rumblings make the windows rumble simultaneously. I had believed that I would get a VCR too along with a TV set. There was no trace of a VCR. But I did eyperience various bombardments. People with various tools like sticks and iron bars.. ..and started bashing me up. Why did they do so? - I don't know. They were screaming the name of Veeru Dada, even as they bashed me. They called me a scoundrel, and ridiculed me for having returned. But you aren't Veeru dada! I'm Veeru Dada! How did I enter inside the lock-up? - That's what I'm wondering about? People mistook you to be Veeru Dada, and bashed you up. You've an identical face like me. But I was the only son of my parents. My father was a real gentleman too. But my father was a scoundrel, you know. Go and meet your brother. What the hell! I requested you to implicate him and teach him a lesson! This civilised citizen has been accused of being an evil person. He's accused of indulging in selling naive girls abroad. This allegation is baseless and false. I seek your permission to present in court the girls and their parents.. ..who're employed in his organisation. - Permission is granted. What's your name? What do you do? - I used to work in a mill. You used to work? You don't work now. I don't keep well. I cannot work properly now. Do you recognise this man? - Yes. Who is he? - He's God. What do you mean? Sir, he's offered a good job to my daughter. We've nothing to complain against him. He's lying. Either he has been silenced with the power of money. Or he might've been threatened with dire consequences. You're bringing emotions into play. You may speak only when you're permitted to. Sir, I've nothing to complain against him. After hearing the several arguments, the court hereby concludes.. ..that Tuti Shah is a decent and civilised human being. He has been unduly harrassed by the police force. Subsequently, the court orders the release of Tuti Shah. You fool. I've a ecord of sorts in the world of crime. I'll be shortly celebrating a golden jubilee year.. ..whereas you've not even completed 100 days since you started practice. You're still a kid. Behave like a kid. Come to my home. I'll serve you chocolates. Do not play dangerous games with your elders. If you fall down, you might suffer injuries. Leave me! Leave me! Don't let him go. I've caught him red-handed. You're committing a contempt of court. You're committing a comtempt of the law. You sentence the innocent to death by hanging. On the other hand, you acquit criminals. By wearing this uniform, I feel as if I'm under captivity. I'm releasing myself of all my captivity. Today. At this very moment. I'm resigning from my job. Yes. I'd forgotten. You're no longer a inspector. Don't bother. What if the goverment doesn't support you. I'll help you. Whenever you need a job, ask me for it. Don't hesitate. It's my record.I provide more water to a bent tree. I've not bent down. That's all that I wanted to convey to you. It's much more easier to eliminate you now. I would like it if you would feel the danger from me every moment. It would be great fun, ideed. It will be much more enjoyable to kill you now. Till yesterday, you were protected by the government. You're a stray dog today. I'll make you slog before I kill you now. Your mind has deteriorated considerably. The person whom you consider to be a dog is in fact a tiger. And when a tiger is wounded, he proves to be death for the hunter. You may try to evade me as much as you like. One strong leap is enough to trap you in my clutches. You may note it down. It is my record. Dr.Mathur is going to Germany. He'll return within 15 days. He'll operate on your eyes as soon as he returns. He was saying that you would be able to see once again. I would be truly happy when you regain your eyesight again. What happened? How is Maria? Why're you so keen in knowing about her? Your own life is a living hell. You should've at least bothered about her. Do you realise my concern for her pain and misery? How can a killer like you feel concerned about anyone? You're right when you say that I'm a killer. But I'm not a born killer. I was noble by birth. Circumstances turned me into a killer. Even you weren't born with your police uniform! It's all a matter of fate. If I had been born in your place, I would've been an officer.. ..and you would've been a killer. Please don't misunderstand me. I'm a victim of my own destiny. I've come to thank you. You're not a human being. You're a messenger of God. By arranging for Maria's operation, you're doing me a great favour. In exchange for this favour, I'll offer you whatever you ask for. Once if Maria forgives me... ..and I eliminate Tuti Shah, the man responsible for my crimes.. I'll surrender myself to the police. I love Maria very much. Please care for her. Please care for her. Michael. Do you know who's come to meet you? Maria cannot see. But she has seen the human within your heart. She has come to meet you. Don't worry about me. Protect Maria. Go! Two is always more powerful than one. The wound is very severe. I've suffered many more severe wounds.. ..which were inflicted by your father when he killed my father. Is this Michael my son? Do you remember the past? I remember everything, friend. My destinity has been very unjust to me. But I'll not be unjust to you. Fire the pistol. Kill me.. ..and pacify your feeling of hatred created because of my father. Fire the pistol. After all, the son has to bear the consequences of his father's deeds. Fire the pistol. Kill me today Vijay. Yes. I'll definitely kill you. And whenever I meet your father.. I'll let him know how I'd killed you. No. If you consider his father guilty, don't punish his son. Fire the pistol, and seek your revenge. D'Souza is standing before you. So it's you. It's good that you appeared before me. You've no right to live. That's enough. How long will you maintain silence? Why don't you tell him the truth? No. He is full of fury. He wouldn't listen to the truth. - He'll have to listen. Vijay! He hasn't murdered your father. Yet he went to jail for a crime he didn't commit. He'd lost his own son. He treated you like his own son. He showered you with love like he would love his own child. Your father wanted to make you a police officer. So D'Souza slogged day and night in the prison.. ..and paid for your education. You shouldn't even talk rudely to him. How could you have pointed a pistol at him? Shame on you! Who was the scoundrel who ruined our lives? Who was he? He is still living. His name is Tuti Shah, the cause of our destruction. God is really great. He helped us re-unite so that we may seek revenge. By arranging a meeting with Maria, you'd done me a big favour. And now, by protecting her life, you've done me another big favour. The two girls are not to be found in the church. I've brought you along to seek revenge from your mates. They love you a lot. Don't they? When they realise that I've sold the two of you abroad.. ..they would be really pained. It's my record that I make my enemy suffer so much.. ..that he prays for his own death. The Almighty has returned me everything that I desired. I got back my father, my friend. I got everything. But I couldn't provide for Maria's eyes. Do me one favour. After I die, give my eyes to Maria. Maria will be able to see again. Look! I can see! I can see with your eyes!
