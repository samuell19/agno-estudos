My bad karma getting married to her. One thing I don't understand. You guys were happy before marriage. And few days after the wedding too. Why all these sudden twists? -What went wrong between you two? -Just nothing. You are hiding something! Tell us what really happened. You met her guy in the drive in right? Did you find anything about him? Yeah Drive in? Well actually... -Hello -Hello son. I'm Meenakshi's uncle. Yeah tell me. Well, heard few boys of the village talking. She was apparently with one Bangaram. And now he lives in Hyderabad. I'll share his phone number and address. See if that's the guy? Yeah thanks. I'll check. -Who was that? -Meenakshi has a lover called Bangaram! -Bangaram? -Bangaram... (Gold) Meenakshi loves this guy? My Karma -You are a fortunate man bro! -Me? Marrying Meenakshi isn't an easy thing to do. -Beer or whiskey? -No thanks.

That's true. I even boasted to my friends about proposing to her. I even told her 'I love you'. And so... "Get lost you pig" that's what she said. Her one answer broke my heart into thousand pieces. If Meenakshi rejected you, why does everyone see you as lovers? Oh, I spread those rumors. -What's all this man? -I have one doubt though. Why are you in this situation of searching for your wife? What can I say? Few days after the wedding... ...she left me with a letter saying she's going away with a guy she really loves. -I saw her with someone bro. -Where? -Not sure if he is her lover or a friend. But definitely a body builder. -My friend saw him too! -I did too. Owner of Punjagutta FitMax gym. Rocky. -Rocky. -Rocky. -Rocky. -Hmm. Fitmax. -Rocky Fitmax! -Punjagutta. -Rocky Fitmax? -Fitmax!

Where's Meenakshi? -How do I know? -Hey she was with you right! That day she was. How will I know who she is with today. Shut up. Don't talk shit about her? I'll say whatever I want. What will you do? See I am not her to fight. Tell me where's Meenakshi. I need to talk to her. You're searching for a wife who eloped with someone else... ...what a loser! Hey. You are the loser.

You... are you not a virgin? Hey... why are you crying? How can you, that too on our first night, ask your wife if she is a virgin? Oh terribly sorry. I blabbered nervously. There's no tension. You said it purposefully. Sorry. Please don't mind. I'm totally okay, even if you are not a virgin! Don't touch me. Oh God! How did you ask her something like that! Like I said sir I rambled something in tension. So, you kept fighting all that night? She kept crying all night sir. Then in the morning? Son! -The lunch box -Yeah. We'll leave in the evening son. We have lots of work home. -Ok! -Son, tell her and go! Meenakshi Meenakshi! I'm going to the school. I called her many time to apologize! She avoided all my calls. When I asked my friend for advice, he said take home something she likes and she will cool a little. Yes. That's right. I do the same thing whenever my wife is angry too! Oh Lord. I did the same too! ♫ On the mango tree are two nests ♫ ♫ On the mango tree are two nests ♫ ♫ In one nest lives a parrot, a cuckoo in the other ♫ Listen!I brought you your favorite milkshake. ♫ On the mango tree are two nests ♫ Good news for you.

Madam you too. -You please leave. Bye. -Bye sir. How dare you plan all this without asking me. -I already told you about it right? -What did you say? Usually, newly weds go to honeymoons right? -As if we are not fighting enough here. -We have to go there to fight more? What's your problem? You think I really care if you are virgin or not. Sorry. I don't really care even if you are not. Oh wow. All hail the social revolutionary! I said I wanted a job, not get married. No one even cared. Government Job. Get married. They threatened me that won't speak if I didn't. They ruined my life. One minute please. -Yes Dad -Are you up son? -Yes Dad. -Is my daughter up too? -Yes she did. -Please give it to her. -One minute. -Okay. -Meenakshi Dad. -I don't want to speak. -Please, it won't be nice. -Why it won't be nice. I'm not in a mood and I'm better off not speaking. -Dad. -Yes? Meenakshi is in some work. I'll have her give you a call later. -Is it okay? -Okay son, just don't forget. Why won't you speak! -Don't you have respect for the elders? -Oh yeah you respect me a lot right? No regard for father in law. No respect for husband. How did your parents raise you! -Don't you dare speak about my parents. -Your father is no less. -Publicly he announces 10 lakhs as dowry. -And he gives a big nothing! Oh yeah, what about your dad? He commented. on my way of speaking and everything else! Heart patient why can't he sit in a corner instead of digging up things? -I hate to even look at him. -Meenakshi. So you hit her and then killed her? I don't have the heart to hit anyone sir. Just raised my hand in anger. So you are a wife beater too huh! That's that sir. After that we didn't speak to each other for two days. Two days later, Meenakshi cooked something for me and packed a lunch box for me. I knew you would cool down. If we put two new fishes in this aquarium, they initially fight a lot. But after that they live happily. We are no different from those fishes. But in that lunchbox she left a letter that she was going away. I rushed home to check. But she was already gone. -You've got great story narration skills. -You think this is a story? You want me to reveal the truth? You fell madly in love with that short film girl. Planned it really well and murdered your wife. Sir, how can you say that sir? The postmortem report proves that your wife was killed on February 10th. You weren't in your school that day? I inquired. Where were you? -That day, I went to meet Bangaram. -Who is he? -Meenakshi's ex-lover sir. -Where did you meet him? At the Nine Bar. Not all this sir. There's one guy called Rocky. A Boxer. He was seen with Meenakshi. I suspect him a lot sir. When we asked him, he beat us badly. You must catch him sir. Please sir. -No food for him now. -Huh? After another round in the evening, the writer and actor inside him will die and the real man will come out. Sir. Sir. Please listen to me sir. -Looks like he's innocent sir. -Then get him a garland and fire a light! Go to that Nine Bar, check the footage and tell me if he was there that day. -Yes sir. -Don't give me unnecessary advice. Come sir. This is all the footage we have. -Sir. -Yeah. He seems to be telling the truth. He was here in the bar till noon. Like I said, he seems innocent. OK. Get the footage and come to the station. Yes sir. Hey. I still don't trust you fully. So until the investigation is finished, you've got to report to the station daily. And without telling me, you cannot leave town. -Hello sister -Brother, were the police rough with you? -Nothing like that -Any clue who killed her? No clue. They're still investigating. Can't bear with curious relatives! -Does dad know? -No. He keeps asking about you. It's tough keeping this secret. Wait. I'll put him on. -Hello dear. -Dad tell me. -Heard your phone broke. -Yes dad. Just got it repaired. -Listen son. I keep sensing something. -I feel like I should come there. -Just not yet dad. I'll be there in few days. Okay. Give the phone to the daughter in law. -Dad. Meenakshi's asleep. -I 'll call you later. Alright? Alright son. -Hey, where's your dad? -Dad. What sir? Did you see my wife coming home last week? No sir. You're always asleep drunk. Recollect well. -I stay here only no sir. -Madam didn't come here at all sir. Last week? No Sundar. -Not sure Sundar. -I just returned home today. No Sundar. Please remember another time. No Sundar. I'm sure I'd know if she had come home. Okay. Thank you. February 10th. Monday. You know, that day I made my career's best music album. Day long I was glued to my system. I was in the zone that day. It is memorable for me that way. And for you... I don't have a clue if she came home that day sir. How can her blood be under the fridge sir? And I don't even know if the blood belongs to her sir. -Dad left? -Yes sir. Rangam Sir. -Hello. -Hello. I know your dad quite well. What do you do? I look after dad's business! Tell me everything that happened, without falsifying anything. There's nothing to lie here. Me and Meenakshi, we were in love. We were even thinking of getting married. But dad said no. I had asked Meenakshi for some time to convince him. She waited for long too. But dad was never convinced. And, without his approval I couldn't do anything. Meenakshi was under parents' pressure. And so she got married. After that we lost touch. Few days after the wedding, she called me out of the blue. She was crying about some problem with her husband. I don't want to be here. Does anyone speak that way? I'm so confused. He almost hit me too! When the girl I love called and cried... ...I couldn't take it. I just asked her to come with me. -And then? -Later... Just tell her dude. She's gone insane! -Yes I'm going mad! -So what's wrong now huh? -You're telling me your wedding plans now? -So what? That's for my dad. -But, I need you! -What do you mean? See you're married. And I'm going to get married. All that's for the society. But we love each other right. Huh? And this will be a happy space. We both can live in happily together. So I'll be your mistress now? Oh just tell her! She simply doesn't get it! -Meenakshi, don't over think this? -Rocky, please don't interfere. -For him I left my husband and family. -Oh shut up about your sacrifices. You came here because you couldn't live with him! -Life long I don't want to see your face. -Meenakshi. Meenakshi. Meenakshi that's not what I meant. Meenakshi wait. Please. -Meenakshi listen. -Move. Meenakshi I didn't mean it. Meenakshi I'm sorry. -Please. I'm sorry alright. -I don't need your sorry. -Meenakshi, where will you go? -To some hell! Why do you care? -Meenakshi stop. Please don't go. -You don't deserve me. Meenakshi wait. You are not freaking going anywhere! Just leave me! -Hey Rocky just close the damn door. -Aakaash. Uh huh! Oh! So Meenakshi died like that? No no no. Why will I kill Meenakshi! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. So sorry. To love you is my life's biggest mistake. Meenakshi please. Please! Meenakshi. Meenakshi!.. Meenakshi! Meenakshi! If she had already left you, where could she have gone? Where else will she go sir? She must have definitely gone to her husband's.? When he saw the wife who rejected him return... ...what if he did something in a fit of rage. -Hello! -Hello. It's me Constable Jyothi. -Yes. -Go sit. Tell me sir. Listen carefully son. Yeah. Hey Silence! SI sir is coming to arrest you. Oh why? They let me go right? Why again? I don't have time to explain. But they have a case against you and that short film actress. What case sir? There's the bar CCTV footage. You said nothing would happen right? That's in the past. It's not enough now. Sir this is ridiculous sir Police can do anything. Trust me and hide somewhere. Don't go to your home or a lodge. Are you listening. Son? Sir Yes! And throw that damn phone away. They can track you with it. Oh God! Hey Sundar, what happened?

And instead you bring someone and tell us she is your wife? I wasn't thinking right when I did all of this sir. You were there in the school when they came right, how did you suddenly escape? I escaped realizing that they were going to arrest me sir. Yeah you escaped well. It was me who...uh huh. Hey don't laugh. In 25 years of my service, I never had such a day. What went so wrong? He milked my cheek in front of all my students. What else can go wrong? -Not him, I have to blame these two here. -Huff, just leave him to his Karma Where will he go? Some day I will find him.

How long will you be like this? In fact what's all this? No idea sir. I'm clueless too. You suspect someone? Why did she go and where I have absolutely no idea sir. -Sundar what's your wife's full name? -Why? Eh just say it. -Meenakshi Atluri -Ok. -First you get a good lawyer. -I told my friend Abhi. He's on it. -There's one lawyer I know, I'll talk to him. OK sir. Hey look at this. Someone called Shirisha recently tagged her on Facebook post. Shirisha is her friend. The post says 'At my home with Meenakshi' That means your wife was at her home recently right? She posted a picture on Sunday. I went her home that day. If she was with her, why did she lie to me? When I came the other day, Meenakshi was in your home right? Why did you lie to me? Tell me. Why did you lie? After the argument with Aakaash Meenakshi didn't know what to do. She couldn't come to you. Nor could she go to her parents. With nowhere to go, she called me crying. I asked her to come to my home. -How long will you cry? -My life's screwed. How will I face my parents now! You know about Aakaash right. And you still went to him? The person I'm married to, asks me if I'm a virgin! The day he gets to know about Aakaash, he'll torture me lifelong. -I really got scared! -So you get scared... ...and run to that loser Aakaash because he calls you? This is life Meenakshi. You are married now. Someone tied thaali (sacred thread) around your neck. You are not that old girl now. To leave behind everything easily. I don't know why I keep finding these guys. You found a decent guy. You know how people are elsewhere? If a bride is not a virgin, they ask for more dowry! There are those who blackmail the bride's parents. Bloody he tied the thali right. He should accept me right. He did right? Didn't you tell me he realized his mistake and repeatedly apologized? You think there are husbands who says sorrys and beg for forgiveness? Look who it is. Who is it? Who? -Who the hell is it? -Sundar Hey, go talk to him. Everything will set back to normal. No No. Please don't tell him I'm here. Please. -Listen to me and talk to him. -No. If you tell him I'm here I swear I'm going to die. -Hi. I'm Meenakshi's husband. -Yes of course. Please come in. If she didn't like me why did she get married? I'm a newly wed. Wherever I go, people inquire about my wife. I'm not sure what to tell them? Anything I say, I lose respect . If I have to change my habits, or the way I speak I can do it for her. But she has to say right. In the beginning, Meenakshi asked me a question. What's the meaning of marriage? Then I didn't know. But now I'm beginning to get it. Marriage is acceptance. No two people are similar in life. But if two people can find common grounds and common joys, I'm sure it'll be good. That's what I've come to realize marriage is. I'm not angry on her because she said no to me. I'm just repulsed by myself. I just wanted to meet her and tell her what she means to me. Whenever I think about her, I watch that wedding video. I find myself crying. She said she loves someone and is gone. But husband's is love too isn't it? Few people fall in love before marriage. I just fell in love after marriage. But truth is that I love her. Why all this now? You are her friend. Could you inquire a little and help me find her please? Meenakshi was cyring, long after you were gone. Unnecessarily I ruined his life! He kept begging me. But I wasn't just ready to listen to him. I couldn't understand him. So now what do you think has happened? You got clarity right. Go to him. You think he will accept me now after all this. Absolutely. -I mean I would have definitely accepted her. Who else was I doing all this for? She knew you'd accept her too. That's why, the very next day she started back home. Really she came to my home? She came back for me. To my home... ...and she died in my home? ♫ A cloud of a billion hopes that plucked my heart strings ♫ ♫ A momentary reverie of a thousand radiant colors ♫ ♫ Tell me why such a rush, how unfair it is ♫ ♫ Come back again oh my friend Left and changed my life ♫ ♫ Come back again, come back again My world has turned dark ♫ ♫ Won't you show me, won't you show me ♫ ♫ The light of your heart ♫ ♫ Won't you come back, won't you come back ♫ ♫ Just once for me. ♫ ♫ To teach the lessons of the seven sacred steps ♫ ♫ To fulfill the spells promising unbroken togetherness ♫ ♫ Come back again oh friend With your unforgettable fragrance ♫ Sir. Sir. SIR What are you doing here? It's me sir. Agent from Pushpak. Sir, why did you say that madam won't come. I met her, she said she's ready to come. -You met Meenakshi? -Yeah! Where? -Madam. You recognize me? -Hmm... yeah. -I'm agent Sai, from Pushpak travels. -Yeah. -How are you? -I'm good Madam. What madam, why aren't you going to honeymoon after booking? Sir now wants to go there with his boyfriend. I'm telling you no madam, you'll enjoy the trip. Oh We'll definitely go. I'll be home soon. I'll confirm after talking to him. -Brother how much is this? -250 Madam. -Give me this one. -Okay madam. -Nice selection. -He likes fishes. -Oh a gift for sir is it? I told you no madam, you both are made for each other. Sir like you said, madam left her friend's home, came here directly and bought a fish for you. -What happened brother? -Why is Sundar so angry? Sundar! -Hey what is this? -It's mine brother. -Is it yours? Is it? -I found it brother. -Sundar stop. Don't hit him. -What do you mean you found it. -Yes brother, I found it. -What did you do with Meenakshi. -Sundar Wait. Please. Where did you find it. That night I found it here in the lift brother. Really! -Stop lying. What do you mean night? -Yes brother. I found it that night. -She came at noon that day. -Sundar... -...that entire day, there was no power. It was back only later that night. The fish must have remained inside the lift all day long. -What about the generator then? -We had no fuel. -So we didn't switch on the generator at all that day. Yes brother. The very next day she started back home. February 10th. Monday. You know, that day I made my career's best music album. Day long I was glued to my system. I was in the zone that day. That entire day, there was no power. It was back only later that night. Day long I was glued to my system. I was in the zone that day. -No one's home -What? Uh huh. No one's home is a novel. A thriller novel. I had given to Sundar. I need it now. Sundar isn't home. -I know, but it is urgent. Can you please return it. Okay. Oh wait, don't close the door. I mean I can recognize it. We can save some time. It must be on that shelf. Please see. Uh, perhaps he must have left it in the bedroom reading it. You want to check there? If you find it, please bring it to into my flat. I'll be there. Thank you. -Huh! -Oh no you are scaring me. As if you're not interested and I'm forcing you! -Come on! -You get the hell out of here. Hush. No I've ensured no one saw me coming. I even latched the door. -What do you mean no one saw you coming? -Oh is it? You went in someone's car and you've got nothing going with him right? You thought no one saw you? Or that we don't understands? I didn't tell any of this to your husband. That's why you're acting innocent. Should I say it? Should I tell your husband? Should I? I don't mean that you should stick to your husband Or that you shouldn't enjoy your life you know. You must enjoy. In fact a lot. But when you're in an apartment like this you must enjoy with friendly neighbors Not with some random strangers outside. Please. Please you're imagining things. I'm not that type. -Alright. I have come back to be with my husband happily. Of course you must. I'm not stopping you. -Be happy with your husband too -Aah! -Help! -Shush. Ouch! Help. Help. Help. Leave me. Help.. Wait.. Meenakshi. Hey. What Sundar? What? Why did you kill her? What? -Why did you kill her? -Uh huh! What do you mean I killed? You're mistaken. I've been your neighbor for such a long time. Don't you know about me? Actually, I must tell you something... Why did you kill her. Say it? Why? Why did you kill Meenakshi? Why did you kill her? -Brother No. Sundar wait. -Listen to us. Hold him. -Sundar wait. -You leave me. Catch him. What wrong did she do against you? We thought you all should know the facts of this case. That's why this press meet. Victim Meenakshi, returned home from her village after a week's stay. At that time, the husband wasn't home. Accused Hindolam stays alone in the opposite apartment. Never married. A failed musician. Has a small crime record in the past. He attempted rape on Meenakshi. She tried to escape and died. Head injury. Spot dead. Accused panicked. And in a state of confusion, he planned to dispose off the dead body. Finger prints and other evidences. He removed them all! So how did you catch him sir? -Every criminal makes a mistake. That becomes our clue. Victim Meenaksh bought a fish as a gift for her husband. But she forgot that in the lift. That was my clue. With that small clue, I solved the entire case. What I'm saying is, criminals stay among us. They seem like normal people. You must be very careful with them. Especially women. If you ever need any help, please meet your SI Rangam... Life's lessons aren't taught in any school or a university. I'm a Math Teacher right? I always believed that if calculation is done well, every problem has a solution. But for few questions there are simply no answers. Will we remain stuck where we are... ..or can we move forward with hope is in our hands. And so even though it took time, I feel I have taken the right decision. And even in marriage, these expectations, and calculations just don't work. Just we both have to accept each other. You can say what you're thinking Um...! I was wondering... ..you posted this photo in the matrimony site... Uh huh. Now you're with beard and all. Devdas look huh? Uh...nothing like that. Just a Tirupati vow. Oh okay. If you don't like I'll remove it. No. That's alright. I've told you everything about me. Now you tell me. -In your opinion, what's marriage? -Hmm... Uh huh... Marriage is... Marriage is... [♪♪♪]
