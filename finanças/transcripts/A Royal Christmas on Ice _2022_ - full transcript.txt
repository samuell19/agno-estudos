Ow! Unfortunately, today an upper ankle sprain has ended the promising rise of Winter Olympic hopeful, Abigail Simpson, eliminating her from the semifinal trials. We wish her a complete and speedy recovery. Maybe we'll see her again in four years. - And that is how you do not execute a camel spin. Were you hurt badly? Nothing I couldn't recover from, but enough to pull me from my spot. Why didn't you try again? It took everything my parents could muster to get me that far and I didn't wanna wait another four years. My plans had changed. I decided I wanted to teach and coach the next group of Olympic hopefuls which is you guys. Now, go put your skates on. We've a lot of hard work before the Christmas Ice Parade. That must have been hard to watch. Trust me, Janet, it was. But showing it to the class makes a point. - Which is? - Don't get cocky and start believing in your own publicity. Let's go. Hey, why not do a little advertising? We can offer some sort of discount code, or special beginner class, make a great stocking stuffer. And how you think I'm gonna pay for advertising? My good looks? Exactly! Abbie, you were almost famous. You still are! Look, let's plaster your name and picture on a poster. We could put them all over town. We're already promoting the Christmas Ice Parade. Let's make it more interesting. Look, I don't know. It, it sounds desperate. Like I'm giving up. You listen to yourself? Isn't that what you're already doing? Giving up? Wow. Aren't you supposed to be my best friend? - Your bestest. - Okay. - Well, then go supervise the kids. - Oh. Aye, aye, Captain. And don't look so down. You act like you're the only person to ever go through something like this. What if I am? What if you're not? Goodbye. Mm-hmm. No. Go! Get it outta the zone. Get it outta the zone. Go! No! No. Come back! Get him. Get him. You can do it. You can do it. Stop him. Stop him. Don't let him get there. No! Stop! Stop! Aah! It's impossible. It's bloody impossible. And, yet... And yet... it's true. We lost. Oh, dear. Again, Your Highness? Again. Defeat snatched from the jaws of victory. Perhaps this will help you calm yourself. How can I be calm at a moment like this? It is but a game, Your Highness. But a game? Are you serious, Marshall? There's no such thing as but a game. If you say so, sir. I do say so! Hockey is not just a game, it's a sport. It's my sport. Of course, Your Highness, and a very noble sport it is too. But, every contest must have a winner and a loser. Fair play and all that. Mm. It's high time I did something about it. You, sir? Do you plan to take up the sport? Marshall, of course not. But I could buy a team. And that way, I'd have some say in how things are done. Your own ice hockey team? Certainly a bold idea, Prince John. And one you should pursue in the new year. Don't be silly, Marshall. I plan on moving forward on this business immediately. As in right now. But, Your Highness, the Royal Family is your business. Please, you sound like my mother. Look, I'm the youngest son in the monarchy of sons. - I will never be king. - - True. LI need to have somethingn in ton my own. y of sons. Something that belongs to me, something that I'm passionate about. Something that's really mine, away from the family. What better than my own sports franchise? Minor League, of course, but how fantastic. Of course. And then, all the profits from the merchandising will go direrectly back to the people... by way of my preexisting charities. Very noble, Your Highness, but how do you plan to achieve this? - By going to America. - America? Yes, I can't manage all of this on my own. I need to go there to set up a co-venture. Partnership of sorts. I need to go there "Daryl Blake." I've a meeting with him in a few days. I have a very small window of opportunity. - I'm planning on seizing it. - But, Your Highness, the Royal Christmas Festivities are imminent. You're expected to be there. I will, Marshall, I'll be there. But I have to do this first. It means everything to me. And I need your silence. Can I count on you? Mm-hmm. Ah, good. Silence is golden. I have a plane to catch. - And see that these are taken care of? - Yes. - Oh, there he is. - Mr. Blake. Your Highness, please call me Daryl. Okay then, Daryl. Uh, in fact, why don't we dispense with the formalities? Uh, my name is John, so we won't be needing any of the royal designations from here on out. Are you sure? A royal title can open an awful lot of doors in a town like this. And the accent doesn't hurt either. Yeah, it can also close a lot of doors. Can even double the price of admission. So, let's just keep it in our back pocket, as you Americans say, until it's useful. Whatever you say, Prince. I mean... John. - Care to take a walk? - Uh, absolutely. Lead on. So you see, what I'd like to do next is to assemble a short list of potential investors, huh, to come on board to help make this team a reality. I'm thinking of calling it "The Monarchy." The Monarchy. I love that. Very clever. And with you as the face of the franchise, well, it's a perfect fit. Oh, I couldn't agree more. - Ready to see your future? - Indeed, I am. Lead on. Right this way. Now, even though they are minor league franchise, we've made arrangements for the team to play in the finest arenas the sport has to offer. Like this. What do you think? It's beyond grand, Daryl. Something I've only dreamed of. - Yeah. We're gonna make that dream become a reality. You understand? I mean, look at this. Luxury boxes, five-star restaurants, cocktail lounges, celebrity endorsements by the dozen. You name it. It's all there for the taking. This is all so fantastic. I'm sold. What do we need to do to make this happen? I'll tell you what we need to do. We leave town. - Leave town? - Yep. Leave town. I am afraid I'm not following. Prince, professional sports franchises are all over the place. The Buffalo Bills play at Orchard Park. The Los Angeles Angels are in Anaheim. The Giants don't even play in the same state. We move outside the mainstream, build d our training facility, our base camp, and we g everything we alwlways dreamed of at a fraction of the ct. Yes. Now I'm following you. I think I've got just the location. Evanston. - Evanston. - Yep. The Evanston Monarchy. - Ooh! - That's where you build. In a small town, not some gigantic metropolis. Instead, an elegant little town And you know what? I've gotta a lead on the perfect location there. You, you think about it. - Oh, I, I am. I, I am thinking about it. - Better yet, you, you should go up there. Check it out for yourself. Yeah. It's less than an hour away. That's a great idea. Just don't breathe a word of this to anybody, okay? News gets out, press goes up, up, up. Play your cards right, all this... can be yours. Understood. Thank you. Thank you. Lee, shoulder's back. Head up. That's beautiful, Jamie. I love it. I never could get the hang of ice-skating. You make it look so effortless. Let me guess. You didn't come here to watch the kids skate, did you? - No. - Look, if it's about the rent for the classroom space, - I'll have it soon. - Listen, Abbie. I love what you're doing with these kids. But...? The owner of this building is thinking of closing it entirely. - Wait, are you serious? - Absolutely. I think they want to turn it into something else or maybe even sell it completely. Mr. Curtis, I need this place. This is where my classroom is. Look, it's Christmas. I really need the money. - Mm. - Come on. We're working on some really big promotions. Promotions? What kind? Your Christmas Ice Parade? So how are ticket sales going over that? Well, they, they could be better, but they're steady. That's good to hear, Abbie. I'll see you in a week. And then Bradley's pass gets deflected in the end zone and still caught by Johnson for a touchdown. Craziest thing I've ever seen in my life. Hey, Al. Hey, Abbie. You, uh, come for your momma's cake? - You bet. Is it ready? - Sure is. - Just gimme a second. - Okay. All right. Here it is. It's as nice as I can make it. And it's paid for already, so you can take her away. It's beautiful. Will I see you at the party tonight? I got an after-hours delivery coming in, eggnog frozen yogurt, but maybe, if it doesn't get too late, I could still stop by. Sounds good. Oh, and thanks for putting up the poster. No problem. But, hey, how come your name is not on the poster? Because it's not about me. It's about the students. Hey, people would pay big money to see you skate again. Al, please. You'd sell a lot more tickets. Guaranteteed box office. I'll think about it. - Thanks again. - All right. Hey, hey! Merry Christmas, Abigail. Oh, Merry Christmas, Don. Merry ChristOh!, Abigail. Oh, dear! Here. Oh, no. I am so sorry. Let me help. No, it's ruined. Well, I'm sure we can fix it. I, I'm sorry, Abbie, there's nothing I can do with this. I knew it. My mom's gonna kill me. Do you think you can make another one? In time for tonight's winter festival? I don't think so. I mean, can we? - Maybe. - Uh, how much time do you need? A few hours at least. I, I, I'm swamped today. - Still have so much to do before tonight. - Look, I feel terrible about this. Let me pay for a new cake. It's the least I can do. - Works for me. - Okay. Thanks, Al. I'll come by later tonight. Hey, excuse me. Uh, sorry, I didn't catch your name. It's Abigail. I'm John. Hey. Hey, Abbie, wait up. Hey, Chad. I heard you were in town. Oh, you look a little down, is something wrong? Uh, the cake for tonight's party got ruined, but that's all. That's rough. - Look, I, I'm in a bit of a hurry. - Then, I won't keep you. Listen, ever since I got back into town, I've just been thinking a lot about you. Really? Well, that's flattering. Look, I know I'm not the quarterback of the varsity football team anymore and you're not The Princess On Ice, but it doesn't mean we can give it another shot, right? I've just been thinking a lot about the future. Now, maybe there might be a future for us. That's really sweet, but I have a lot on my plate right now. I hear you. But on a more serious note, um, the real estate market around here is exploding and expanding, and Mr. Curtis has some really big plans for me. Yeah, I saw him earlier too. He told me someone's trying to convert the ice rink into something more profitable. I mean, I've heard a few things, but those are just rumors, Abbie. I'm sure there are other ice rinks. You know, I could really be of some assistance to you, if you'd just let me. All I need is you back in my life again. Look, there's a lot of reasons why people break up, Chad. We really tried, but... we just weren't the right couple. You know, and I could help you with your school. We could be partners. You could hire some teachers. I mean, why keep risking your health out there on the ice, you know? You got lucky once. Could have been a lot worse. Yeah, but it wasn't. I know you. And I know you wouldn't be sitting on the sideline, not competing if you weren't worried too. Let me take that worry away. Come on. I'll think about it. Okay? - It's good to see you. - You too. Just because your brother's not seen out with the same woman on his arm every night, why do people find that interesting? Honestly, he could easily find himself a, a suitable heiress who adores him. I mean, Mother would love that. But... he chooses the life of a bachelor. Unwilling to settle down. Why is that, do you think? It's perfectly simple. He's never found a woman fascinating enough to freeze him in his tracks. You mean he's never found a woman who could hold her own with him? Perhaps, but don't give up on himim just yet, Your Hiness. Wellgood luck changing his mind. Have you seen this? - What is it? - See for yourself. Please, Marshall, sit. - A business plan? - He's trying to start his own professional ice hockey team in America no less. - A business plan? - He's trying to start his own profeslce hockey team? y team His obsession with the sport has finally gone to his head. He eats, sleeps and breathes professional ice hockey. He can't be serious. Oh, but he is. As he sees it, he's finally going to do something for himself, have something all his own. And... I can understand where he's coming from. I mean, I knew he was head over heels for the sport, but I didn't realize it had gone this far. What ever will Mother think? Perhaps she doesn't need to know about it. Not just yet, anyway. I think we owe your brother that much, don't you? Agreed. Oh! - Hey, I'm home. - Hi, Mom. Oh, let me give you a hand. Oh, thanks. Here, take the one under my arm before I drop it. - Where's your father? - Oh, he's at the center. - He's decorating for the party tonight. - Oh, perfect. I don't want him snooping around in my packages. Oh, did you buy him something nice? Of course not. I bought myself something. So what are you up to? I'm just making some Christmas cards for my friends. - I don't have enough money to buy gifts this year. - I know. But they'll understand. Everything is going to be fine. So, where's the cake? Uh, about that. Oh, no, don't tell me. Well, I went to pick it up today and there was this guy who wasn't looking where he was going, and he ran right into me and knocked it right outta my hands. - It's ruined. - Oh, dear. But, but, it's gonna be okay. They're making a new one. They're gonna deliver it directly to the center, so... everything's good. How are you? Are you okay? You mean, like, am I hurt? No, I'm fine. So who ran into you? Was it anybody we know? Um, no, I don't think so. Some guy with a fancy foreign accent. Maybe a, a John somebody. Hmm. Was he handsome? Mother, please. Well, was he? Yeah. Hmm. Marshall? I'm sorry to disturb you, Your Highness, but I was just ringing to see if you'd come to your senses yet. Oh. Absolutely not. Look, Prince John, I'm very concerned about you, - as is your brother. - Roger? Concerned about me? How charming. Does my mother know anything yet? No, Your Highness, I've been able to cover for you thus far. Luckily, she's been very busy with her holiday preparations. That's good, Marshall. But I cannot continue this charade much longer. She's bound to find out sooner or later. So what if she does? I'm not a child anymore. I have a right to live my own life as I see fit. Most assuredly, sir. But you should at least keep them abreast of your movements. Of course, I will... in time. I'll return shortly... when I'm ready. Your Highness, you're making my job rather difficult. Well, at is my goal in life, isn't it, Marshall? No if you'll excuse me, I have a party to attend. No, no, no. Please don't, don't hang up on me. Merry Christmas, Marshall. Merry Christmas, Your Highness. Marshall! Where is my son? Uh, Your Majesty. Well, uh, I, I believe he's at the, uh, Royal Banquet Hall finalizing the menu for Christmas brunch. I'm not asking you about Prince Roger. I'm asking you about my youngest son, John. He's about yay high and not too big around. Of course, Your Majesty. Well, uh... I'm afraid, truth be told, he's, uh, gone off to America unexpectedly. Ah, of course. So if this was, as you suggest, an unexpected decision, he can't possibly have any great amount of cash with him. He would have to rely heavily on his credit cards. You know what to do then. Follow the trail. Your Majesty. Marshall, you need to stop phoning me. Won't do any good, and I'm starting to get irritated. Prince John, it's Daryl Blake. Oh, of course, Daryl. My apologies. I was having a bit of a moment with one of my staff back home. Not a problem at all. Must be tough keeping all those balls in the air at the same time. Just wondering how things are going out in Evanston. Oh, Evanston is everything you said it was. Small, quaint... lovely people. - Beautiful. I knew that you would like it. I knew it. - Indeed, I do. And you mentioned you had your eye on a property for a new training facility, right? Don't worry about that just yet. The important thing here is that you can see yourself setting up shop in that charming little town. And it sounds like you can. I believe you've hit on something, Daryl. I knew I was right to trust you. Thank you. Thank you, Your Highness. It's excellent. Um, listen, enjoy your time in Evanston, and I'm here if you need me, and, uh, you'll be back soon? Soon it is. Cheers. So sweetheart, what do you think? Pretty snazzy, huh? Oh, it's nice. Very nice. Uh, Larry, you did a great job. I'm proud of you. Well, I had some help. Well, I hope you let the younger ones get up on the ladder. Absolutely. No more ladders for me. Hey, come here. - Oh, it's beautiful. - Right? When did he drop it off? - Well, he didn't. Pardon me. Well, if Al didn't deliver, who did? I did. My apologies. I couldn't help but overhear. - I'm John. - Oh. Carol, John's staying at the Mountmore Hotel. We met earlier. Oh, that's nice. They have nice rooms, very old-fashioned. Oh, yeah. Absolutely right. Sorry, I don't mean to pry, but, tell me, why did you want to deliver the cake yourself? Because he's the one who ruined the cake in the first place. Uh, yes, regretfully so. Good evening, uh, Miss Abigail, you look very pretty tonight. Oh, thank you. Oh, uh, Janet, this is John. Very pleased to meet you, John. - [John] The pleasure's mine. So, Abigail, what do you think? You know, I'm impressed. I didn't think Al could do it. Yeah, I know. Yeah. John, could you help us for a moment in the kitchen? Oh, why... Yes, of course. Uh, ladies. Come here. Oh, dear. Abbie, why are you being so cold to that guy? Was just an accident. And he's so good-looking, so sophisticated, and that accent... Wow! - Well, accents aren't everything. - Maybe not. But I think he likes you. Well, I doubt that. - Really? Why would he go through all that trouble to deliver that cake in person? Guilty conscience? I can't believe you. You're acting like a kid. Well, how do you want me to act? We're at a party. We're supposed to be having fun. So start acting like that. All right. I want you to promise me you'll be as sweet as pie to the very next person you meet. You promise? I promise. Merry Christmas, Abbie. Chad. Well, good luck with that. If you two will excuse me. Coward. Oh, right here. You can help us put the bags in the boxes. So, John, are you going to be in Evanston for very long? Oh, no, no, not long. Just conducting a little business. Oh, what sort of business are you looking to get involved in? Larry, don't be so nosy. No, it's all right. It's just a little project that I'm working on. I have some pressing holiday engagements back home, so not long, I'm afraid. Mm. That's too bad. Evanston is a wonderful place to spend Christmas. I'm sure it is. And I'd also love to get to know Abbie a little more. If, if I could. And again, I, I am so sorry about everything that happened. Don't worry about that. She's a very understanding person. She just, uh, feels stressed about work right now. Abbie teaches skating down at the ice rink and her class is a little underwhelming at this time of year. That's too bad. Is it a beginner's class? All levels. It's mostly just young people trying to have fun. Abbie was an Olympic hopeful a few years ago, but she had a little mishap during a jump and didn't qualify. Oh, dear. - Did she give it another go? - No. The whole thing was broadcast on TV. Everybody saw it, and she was humiliated. That's a pity. I think I know something that just might cheer her up. I'm all the ears. I have a confession. The only reason I came here tonight was, I was hoping to run into you. Uh, really? - Why is that? - I wanted to apologize if I came out a little strong the other day. Don't. I could've been better myself. What I should have said was, I miss you. I wanna make this a Christmas we can both remember. And I got you a little something. Um... You know what? I, I can't. I mean... Thank you. It's beautiful, but I can't accept this. Here, let me help you. - Uh. - Turn around. Just humor me. - but I think that's a marvelous idea. - Yes. Well... It's been a long day. Uh, perhaps I should say goodnight. So soon? Do you have to? Uh... we haven't even cut the cake yet. Yeah. I, I thought you wanted to talk to Abbie. Oh, well I do, but looks like she's wrapped up at the moment. All right, John. But don't forget what I told you about tomorrow. I won't. And thankou. Are you okay, honey? Just got a lot on my mind, I guess. Nice necklace. - Pricey. - Yeah, it was hard to say no, but I'm just not interested in reviving old flames. The Ice Skating Princess and The Football King. That was a long time ago. Yeah, he wants to pick up right where we left off, but I just don't see us together. I mean, he's a nice guy, but... I don't know, it's just been too long. Sometimes people change. - I have enough going on. - Okay. That's fair. Oh, that fella, John, he was asking about you. Mom, don't go match-making me again. He'll be gone before you know it. Of course, you are right. But he just seems so debonair, so cultured. You're starting to sound like Janet. One guy showers me in diamonds, the other in cake. I'm sure you look beautiful in both. You're a riot. Good night, sweetheart. Why are you following me? Me? [snickers] Never. So you just wander in here where it's a constant 35 degrees? We, Europeans, we're very warm-blooded people. Look, John, uh, this is my private time in the ice. It's the only alone time I get, so... Ah, yes. Of course, of course. Uh, my apologies. I didn't mean to intrude or interrupt. I was speaking with your mother last night, and she told me about your skating classes, and I thought... Well, maybe... - You? - Of course. Why not me? Besides, I thought you might find it entertaining to see me fall down a few times. Well, it's tempting, but you seem pretty fit. Looks can be deceiving. Okay, fine. Go rent some skates - and I'll see what you got. - Wonderful. Oh. You look like you've done this before. Uh, some, when I was a young lad back home. And where exactly is "back home"? Just a small little berg outside of Belgium. Uh, lovely place of no real consequence. And does this berg have a name? Ooh. Well, yes, of course. Of course it does. But the real question, how am I doing? Uh, it's harder than you remember, huh? Considerably so. Well, do you think I have what it takes? If I can train a ten-year-old, I can train you. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Sorry. I'm a bit wobbly. - You seem fine. - No, no, no, trust me. I'm, I'm shaky. Uh, maybe if you hold my hands. I can't believe you. Now don't let go or I'll fall. Mm-hmm. Come on. Yeah. You're a natural. - Oh, I'm going backwards. - - - Stand up taller. - Oh, yes. Put your right foot forwar - Keep holding my hands. - There you go. And he just showed up completely unannounced? Yeah. I can't believe my mom's so free with my personal information. No. She means well. She always has her nose in my business. I told you he likes you. - He's a bold one. - And single. Okay, you and my mom would make the perfect pair. - Tell me one thing you don't like about him. - Give me a second. - Uh-huh. That's what I thought. And here she is in her first little costume. - I sewed the whole thing myself. - Really? That's amazing. - You did this all by yourself? - Yes, I did. And it wasn't easy, either. All those tiny little sequins and rhinestones. - May I? - Mm. You did a fabulous job. - [Carol] Well, thank you. Mom? What's going on here? Well, after class today, I ran into your mother at the market. Then she asked me how I was getting on. And he told me he didn't have any plans for this evening. So, well, I thought I would invite him here for dinner tonight so we could all get to know him better. Ah, I can leave if it's a problem. No, look, I'm sorry. I'm... I'm just surprised to see you. That's all. Well, then it's settled. I'm going to go help your father in the kitchen. Oh, no. Is he making another one of his Christmas surprise specials? Well, you know your father, he never misses a chance to play around in the kitchen. Oh, no, not again. I wonder what he'll whip up tonight. You're seriously gonna regret doing this. You know, I never realized what an incredible athlete you are. Do you feel like you... didn't live up to your full potential? You have no idea. Yeah. I have moments like that. And then you made them your life's work. Yeah. It's reduced to only work. If your work is your love, then you'll never work again. Shakespeare? Fortune cookie. Dinner. Your father's candy cane cheeseburger casserole. I warned you. Oh! Tell us, John, what do you like to do with your time? Oh, um... Well, to be honest I don't really have a lot of free time. I've always been kept pretty busy. With? My duties. Oh, uh, but it's all boring. Oh. I saw a poster of the Christmas Ice Parade yesterday at Al's Diner. What's that about? Each year, Abbie's students - put on a holiday show for the town. - Really? Maybe I arrived just in time. Oh, yes, you did. Last night was the Annual Holiday Winter Festival party and tomorrow is our Christmas Food Bank Drive. And next Saturday, Abbie's students will present this year's Christmas Ice Parade. I see. - Are you a part of the show? - Uh... - No. It's showcasing the students. - Oh. Well, uh, are there any tickets still available? Uh, yeah. All you could want. Uh, you know, kids, I ordered dessert today. But I didn't have time to pick it up. Oh, well, not a problem. I could take a trot... - Oh. - over to Al's and pick something up. Shouldn't take long at all. What a splendid idea, isn't it, Abbie? Yeah, splendid. Hmm. Well, now the two of you hurry along and Dad and I will take care of cleaning up here. Me? You want me to go too? Yes. Someone has to carry the dessert while John's driving. Shall we? - Hey, good evening, folks. - Good evening, Al. Have a seat at the end. I'll be with you in a minute. Mm-hmm. - All right? Careful with that, it's hot. - All right. - Here. - Thanks. Watch that. Hey, what can I get you two? I got some great drink specials this evening. Oh, no, thanks. Uh, we're here for a to-go order. Just a quick dessert or something. I got some cupcakes cooling off in the back. I can frost up a few if you gimme a few minutes. That would be great. Could you spare four? Four? By tomorrow afternoon, I'm gonna need 400. So, hey, what's a few cupcakes among friends, huh? Wait, I'm sorry. 400 cupcakes? You're joking, right? No, that's what my mom was talking about. The Christmas Food Bank Drive. All the local merchants put together holiday boxes to help those in need. Yeah, but 400 cupcakes in that small kitchen. Yeah, it's a lot of work. Goes faster and easier if you have a little help. You can count me in. Oh, right. Um, I'd be very happy to lend a hand. Great. See you guys tomorrow. 9:00 am. - [John] Yes. Well, it looks like you'll know where to track me down tomorrow. Ha-ha. Very funny. So do I get to call you Abbie, now that we're coworkers? Oh, now who's being funny? Look, I really like you, Abbie, and I'd like you to like me if you think you could. And how do you suggest I do that? Well, I was thinking... If it were up to me... I'd ask you to dance. Dance? With you? [chuckles] What, here? Darling, can you think of a better time? I haven't danced in a long time, so, sorry if I'm stepping all over your feet. Come on, don't be silly. You're doing great. As any champion skater would. Normally, I don't like flattery, but, for you, I'll make an exception. Well, look who it is. Abigail Simpson. Out on the town two nights in a row. Um, John, this is Chad. We went to high school together. Oh, yes, I saw you last nighght at the party Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I saw you there with Abbie. Nice to meet you, officially. Hey, guys. Your order's ready. We were just leaving. [exhales Abbie, wait. I'm sorry. Maybe I can call you tomorrow and we can talk then. - [Keep the change. - Enjoy. s] Can I ask, what was all that about? Look, my parents are waiting. We should probably go. Right, if you say so. I do. Hey, honey. Sit down, breakfast is almost ready. Oh, I can't, I'm in a bit of a hurry. Oh, and why is that? I just have to do something before class. Something important? I'm headed to the diner to help Al. He's up to his ears with the cupcake orders. - Just you? - Mom, please. Well, I think it's sweet that you're helping out. Well, it's the least I could do. And you were right about John. He is a nice guy. Great. I just thought the two of you might hit it off. I figured that. Well, did you? - Did I what? - Did you hit it off? Yeah, I guess we did. Bye, Mom. - Have fun. - But thank you. Hey, Janet, I've been thinking about what you said and I think you're right. Yes. [chuckles] I know. Okay, so I'm gonna need you to write this down. Ready? - Hey, Al. - Hey. Good morning, Abbie. Hey. What do you need me to do? Well, uh, if you can get these frosted up, - I'll put another batch in the oven. - You got it. By the way, I really appreciate this and so will all the families. Of course, I'm happy to help. Sorry my assistant didn't show up. Well, who hasn't shown up? Oh. Hey, you're here. I was just taking out the trash. I've been here for at least an hour. What kept you? Well, I... Okay, you two. Here are your piping bags. You know what to do. I'll put another batch in the oven. Aye, aye, Captain. - You ready? - All right. Yes. I'm gonna do the bottom. Oh! I'm not as good as I thought I would be. You're doing great. Yeah. Uh. Get off my cupcake. - Which one are you doing next? - I'm gonna go for this one. - This one? - No. I have to go first. You can't mess up the design. Oh! Not too bad for a city boy. Ah. I was, I was about to say the same thing about you. You didn't have to help out. I really appreciate it. Of course, I did. Beginning to feel really invested in this town Starting to like it here very much. Hey, sorry to break up this little love fest. We got five more trays to get to, guys. You got it. - Merry Christmas. - Hey. Please, have some fresh food. - Hi. - Can I get you anything? - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. Oh. - Okay. Thank you. Okay. This is amazing. Thank you again for asking me to do this. I, I feel like I'm a part of something really meaningful. Well, you are. That's what Christmas is all about here in Evanston. We try to give back as much as we can. Well, I can see why. This, this is really special. You know, when I first met you, I was really upset, but... I think I was wrong. Well, I did ruin your cake. No, I was just having a rough day and I shouldn't have taken it out on you. I think we have that part sorted out and for the better. Thank you. And, Abbie, I've, I've really enjoyed getting to know you. Well, I'm glad you're getting what you wanted. Y... You know, you can too. Yeah. I mean... Look, I really love my school, but I just don't know how to salvage it. Thank you. I think you could turn it around if you really tried. You just have to go for it. You know what to do. That's what Janet says. And she's always right. We'll see. Mm. - Merry Christmas. - Thank you. Hey. There you go. - Thank you. - Yeah. - This is for you. - You need some help? Oh, yeah. Sure. - Hey, bud. - Here you go. Hello. Merry Christmas. - Oh, this is so much fun. And where upon earth is Al? He should be here. We're only here because of his hard work, and I feel guilty, like, we're taking all the credit. Oh, I'm sure he's around here somewhere. Ho, ho, ho! - Oh! - Merry Christmas. Who wants presents? - Me. - Me. I don't believe it. That guy loves Santa. All right. He does it all for the kids. Have you two been good this year? Oh, I'll plead the Fifth on that one, Santa. No, I, I don't know. I'll find out Christmas morning. Thanks for helping out, guys. Merry Christmas. - Doesn't he make a great Santa? - In fact, he does. I'm beginning to see why people come to Evanston and stay. Did you get that? Got it. Over there? Mm-hmm? - Mr. Curtis, what's up? - Okay? Oh. Uh, good morning, Abbie. Uh, we're just taking a few pictures of the building. A few pictures? Why? Well, as I told you, the, the owners of this property are thinking of converting this place into something else. But this is my space. For the moment. Uh, hey. Good luck with your show. I hope you sell out. Yeah, me too. - There's no class today. - Oh, I know. I was just hoping to swing by and pick up a few pointers. Wanna come skate with me? Oh, come on. I'll let you hold my hand. Well, how can I say no? - Morning. - Good morning, Mr. Denucci. - I'd like to rent a pair of skates. - Same again? - Same again. - I remember, size ten. And I'd like to keep the tab open. You might consider buying a pair. Might be cheaper. Probably. I'll think about it. - Have a great day. - You too. - Like this? - Yeah. Keep going. Okay. So, you guys have all worked so hard to prepare for this year's show, and, honestly, I think it's our best one yet. Sadly, our ticket sales have been low, mainly to all of our friends and family, and I think we all can do a little bit better. I mean, I can do better. And I wanna do better for all of you. So with that said, and a little friendly persuasion, I have decided to lace up my skates and perform with you guys this year. Now, some people think that's going to boost ticket sales, I'm not so sure, but Lord knows we can use all the help we can get. It'll be A Cameo on Ice. Got them. Wow. Abbie, if this doesn't fill the space, then nothing will. People love a comeback story. And you're an all-town's favorite. What's not to love? - Mm-hmm. - Abbie, this could put your school on the map. I've been telling her the same thing for weeks now. But no, it takes someone like you to come along to finally convince her. Okay, so we have the posters. - Now what? - Now we go out and start putting them out where people can see them. Make sure you take all the old posters down and don't forget to thank everyone for letting us put these up. You won't be sorry. You'll see. What do I have to lose? Exactly. Okay, kids, come on. Let's get going. That looks pretty good, right? Yeah, I think so. Brings back a lot of memories. Thanks for that. Well, I didn't do anything. Yeah, but you did. You made me start believing in myself again. All the self-doubt and disappointment, all for nothing. - Thanks to you. - Well, good. Let's celebrate then. Dinner tonight at Al's. And maybe we can finish that dance we started. I would love that, but I'm in training mode right now and I don't think my coach would approve. But your coach won't take no for an answer. at, Well, it sounds like my coach has made up his mind. I made up my mind the first time I ever saw you. Then I guess that's a yes. Your Highness, at last. Oh, dear me. Thank goodness I found you. How ever did you manage it? You shouldn't have used your credit card to rent those skates. And I remember the name on the business card you presented me last week. Your Highness, your guy here is very persuasive. He said it was an emergency. An emergency? Well, your mother has been worried sick. How ever could you tell? Please, Your Highness, she is the Queen. The Queen? The Queen of what? The Queen of the Kingdom of Donegal, Miss. The Queen of Donegal? Wait, the little berg outside of Belgium? Wait, if your mother's the Queen that makes you, uh... His Royal Highness, Prince John Lackland. If you don't mind, I'm kind of occupied at the moment. Can we talk later at the hotel? Your Highness, I am under the strictest orders not to leave your side until you are back at Donegal. Well, I'm sorry, Marshall. Regretfully, that is a royal command. - But... - Yes. As you desire, sir. John. I'm kind of freaking out right now. Abbie, I can explain all of this. No, don't explain anything. Just tell me the truth. Uh... Yes. It's true. I'm a, I'm a prince, but a very minor prince. There's no such thing as a minor prince. Uh, I'm sorry, Your Highness, I don't know what your thoughts are, but this ice rink would make a beautiful sports facility for your new franchise. What? This ice rink? Yeah, the Prince's new professional hockey franchise. The Evanston Monarchy. So that's what this is all about. You're trying to buy this ice rink for your hockey team? No, no. I didn't know that this was the building that Mr. Blake was looking at. You're the one that's trying to put us out of business. No, absolutely not. Believe me, Abbie, I didn't know he was trying to buy this building. - You have to trust me. - Trust you? How could you do this? I thought you liked me. But I do. Abbie, I, I do. More than anyone ever before. You have a funny way of showing it. I never wanna see you again. That could have gone better. Good evening, Your Highness. I hope you're happy doing my mother's bidding. I've made a real mess of things. Don't be disheartened, Your Highness, it's really not all that bad. By tomorrow, we could be back in Donegal, surrounded by the joyous celebrations of the holiday season. A... All of this will be forgotten. Forgotten? A... Are you out of your mind? I finally met someone. I met someone I care about. Now, it's ruined. Sh... She thinks I lied to her and I plotted to put her out of business. You mean you didn't tell her who you were? Well, no, not exactly. But I never lied about it. I just didn't want the royal trappings to get in the way of something special. And the further along it went...? Deeper the rabbit hole. I never dreamt I'd meet someone like her. Certainly I didn't think I'd fall this hard for anyone, but I did. And now it doesn't matter anymore. How can I even think of starting my new project here in Evanston now? Your Highness, there are plenty of other small towns. No, but this one's perfect. And it has the one thing that I've been looking for. The girl I love. I guess that's done now. If that's true, then perhaps it's time for us to return home without delay. I'm sure Mr. Blake can find another suitable location and you can begin fresh after the new year. If you stay, it's only going to be worse. And we still have your mother to contend with. I'm sorry, Marshall. I'm not leaving until I speak with Abbie. But I thought you said it was over, sir. Very well may be. But there's always a slight chance of righting the ship. I want you to make a call for me. Here's what I want you to do. Don't mess it up. Oh, well... - That was good. - It was fantastic. Thought I'd find you here... drowning your sorrows in a milkshake. So you heard. Imagine that. A real-life prince right here in Evanston. Wow. And he was your boyfriend. Well, that ended well, didn't it? Don't count me in on that one. I wouldn't have sent him packing so quickly. Not at least without hearing what he has to say. But I do have some good news. I heard that TV Six, all the way from Lock Valley is going to cover the Christmas Ice Parade. We'll be on TV. This could be huge for the school. Well, if Prince John had his way, my school would already be shut down. Think the TV folks would still be interested in us if they find out the real star of the show is on his way back to his own little private kingdom? Oh, stop. They're not coming to see him. They're coming to see you. Well, maybe they're coming to see him a little, but who cares? - Look, I'll get us a table where people will sign up for lessons. Everyone is going to be so anxious to learn how to skate after they see you perform. Thanks. Look, you've really done a great job. - If only... - If only you weren't so miserable? Are you sure you and the Prince are really through? Seems to me like you guys were just getting started. Yeah, I mean, it happened so fast. It felt like my head was spinning. You say anything that you regretted? Honestly, I don't even remember what I said. Something like, "Get outta my life forever," or words to that effect. You think maybe you overreacted just a little bit? I mean, maybe if you two sat down and hashed things out. He's probably halfway back to Donegal by now. That's where he belongs. Back in the spotlight and in front of his adoring subjects. Wow. You're a real sorehead. Huh. Do you blame me? I mean, he made me look foolish like a love struck school girl. I really thought that he liked me. Are you so sure that he doesn't? I mean, guys can be funny. They're, they're hard to read. Listen, you are never going to know how he really feels about you unless you give him a chance to explain. I don't even think I could do that if I wanted to. Well, you're about to find out. Abigail. Uh, let me guess, my mother told you where I was. Uh, no, I figured this out on my own. Oh, my apologies. Do you mind? Oh, no, no. Not at all. Absolutely. Um, I will, uh, just go help Al clean up a bit. Thought you'd be on a plane by now. No, not yet. I'm not leaving until you hear what I have to say. Well, I guess I can't stop you. Oh, my goodness. Listen, Abbie, I know I should have told you about myself earlier. But when I first got here, I was just trying to have a look at the town to see if it might be a suitable place for us to settle. Yes, we were looking for a building to house our team. But I had absolutely no idea that Mr. Blake was looking at your building. It's just one of many properties that he controls. There are other ice rinks that are just as good, and I promise I would never put you out of business. Then why didn't you come clean about who you were? Do you think I was in for your money or your social status? - Do you really think I'm that shallow? - No. Oh, absolutely not. Of course not. I'm so sorry. I just didn't think it mattered. I mean, the further along things went, the less I cared about that part of my life. Prince John, it, it, it became a liability. I don't know, a title that could just trip things up. I kind of like just being run-of-the-mill John. Yeah, well, I did too. Please. Don't let us end this way. We've come this far... and I never thought that I'd say this, but... I love you, Ms. Abigail Simpson. And I believe that you love me too. I don't know. With how things ended, I mean, we're so far apart, it's not even funny. You think so? Sometimes opposites do attract. But do they live happily ever after? In fairy tales, they do. Give us a chance. Another shot at the gold. Can't we just hit the reset button? Start over? We deserve a try, don't we? And how do you propose to do that? Well, first, there's a dance that we never got a chance to finish. It's time. Come on. Yeah. Oh! I love it. Hope you're ready, 'cause the audience is totally fired up for tonight's show. Ticket sales went through the roof. - You good? - I don't know. I mean, my stomach's in knots, my legs feel like rubber and I'm scared to death. But besides that... - How do we look? - Amazing. Like a million bucks. Oh, my apologies. Two million bucks. Do you really think this is a good idea? I mean, what if I fail? You're not going to fail, Abbie. The girl who lacks confidence didn't shohow up today. The girl who showeup today You'ris a champion. fail, Abbie. And d champions do wh they always do. They win. Thway you say that makes me want to bieve you. Do you rlly think so? Darlin I know so. And now to complete this year's Ice Parade, we have a very special guest star... a return to the spotlight after so many the darling darling of Evanst a retour very ownpotlight afAbigail Simpson. Yeah! They're playing your song. Oh, boy. I can't thank you enough for finally breaking through to her. I mean, this could change everything. I truly hope so. Now, if you'll excuse me. Yeah! Oh! Looks like you got things all sorted out, Your Highness. Indeed, I have Mr. Blake. Indeed, I have. And it looks like we'll be looking for a new piece of property then. That's if you are planning to stay. I trust you'll find something we can all agree on. Now, gentlemen, if you'll excuse me, there's one more thing I need to take care of. I don't know what that is. I think we are about to find out. Whoo! Yeah! Whoo! Attention, ladies and gentlemen, it seems as if we have one last Christmas treat for all of you. A closing duet featuring Abigail Simpson and her very special guest, His Royal Highness Prince John Lackland of Donegal. What're you doing out here? You're crazy. Yes, I'm crazy. Crazy in love. This is insane. I know. Listen, Abbie, sometimes you, you just have to take a chance. What do you say, you and I... Shall we give it a go? How could I say no? Thank you for everything. I don't even know what to say. Don't say anything. You, you've done it right. And now it's your time to take a bow. Miss Abigail Simpson... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Ow! Yeahah! Whoo! Yeah! Yeah!
