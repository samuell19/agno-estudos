This game is called Bedtime. Close your eyes. Relax. See a dog floating over your head. Make the dog blue. Now, make it green. Now, make it purple. Make the dog as big as the universe. Now, make the dog as tiny as a dot. Big as the universe. Tiny as a dot. Big as the universe, tiny as a dot. Open your eyes. Chase the dog. Are you ready girls? Get that cannon ready. We're going to blow this guy away. This was beautiful. You're a genius! Everything looks beautiful, my love. But I couldn't have done it without your support, my pet. - Mwah. - Mwah. Go on. Get out, get out, get out. On it, Mr. Wallendorf. - Want to play a game? - No. Yes. I don't know. Well, that sounds like a nifty game, but I had something else in mind. It's called Flip Flop. Put yourself in a field. See the sun setting. See rainbows, clouds. Don't worry. He'll be fine. I believe in God. Blessings. I love you, Mrs. Wallendorf. You're such a good person. Thank you for such a satisfying life. You're a very good person. How do you feel? Wonderful. - So beautiful. - Mm. I'm going to play a different game. This here one is called Mumbo Jumbo. - This is like a movie. - Cut. We can't win by playing not to lose. Quick, let's all do lots of angel powder. That'll turn on your automatic success mechanism. Look at him. He's good for nothing. These ugly motherfuckers just have big life insurance policies. They always have, like, five babies that need it. We want the red Wallendorf shoes, and his family wants the money from his life insurance. We are as pure as the snow on the roof of a convent. Pass me my bow. Look at him, Rebecca. You got to watch him die. Ooh, nice shot, Cynthia. All of you, let's find the GPS tracking system and make it quick. If it's portable, I want to activate it and leave it on this big body. Sorry not sorry. Go. Go! We've got one tracking system only and it's attached. Okay, wait before you destroy it, we got to be ready to put the pedals to the metal the second that you fry it. Got it. What the f... - Is she okay? - What the fuck! What the... Fuck! It's fucking instant ramen. It was supposed to be Wallendorf shoes. How did this happen? Well, that's just empty calories. Are we even the criminals in this situation? What do we do now? - Just leave it? - No. We have to get rid of it. - How's life? - Gets better with every step. Sir, we've been doing extensive marketing research and we think it's more than a good time to expand our product beyond only manufacturing red high-heeled women's shoes. Sir, your talents as an artist and a designer are globally renowned. Everybody wants more from you than just red shoes. You guys try the new garlic chicken fries over at Annabelle's? Mm, mm, mm. That is the finest shit I've had in years. To be honest, I haven't been to Annabelle's in year, sir. Why not? What's wrong with Annabelle's? Oh, don't tell me. You two are just a couple of bark eating little vegans. Nope, nope. That's a negative. Neither am I, sir. Well, either of you seen my daughter in the last couple of days? No, sir. Should we, um, deploy the rangers? Where to? Your apartment? Sir, your daughter is definitely not in my apartment. How do I know that? You said you were a hot-blooded carnivore just a second ago. And I'm also a happily married man. Well, who isn't? You know what? Just go get my daughter and bring her back here. And then we talk about how my fashion dominance skills are needing to improve. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. And try the chicken fried steak over at Annabelle's, and then we'll talk about product development. Yeah, yeah. - Hey, cheers. - Hey, cheers. So, you grew up in a restaurant like this one? It was similar. My mom and dad and my uncle ran it. Kind of like your family business, except from mine was just a cool restaurant. I was helping in the kitchen since before I could reach the stove. That... sounds cool. Everything kind of sounds cool, but it's really hard work. That's why I ended up the way I am now. - I got no heat in the heart. - Oh. If I cut you, would you feel it? Nobody likes me. Not even you. Yes. You didn't hear what I said, did you? What? Are you even listening to me? Do... Does anyone? What are you trying to say to me right now? I said, nobody likes me, and you said "yes". Of course I like you. - Why? - Why not? Oh my God, mom, it's Jennifer Wallendorf. I know sweetie but it's... it's rude to stare, so just... Hi. - Come on. - Sorry. Okay. That was great. Alright. Fuck, I got spotted. - What's this? - It's no big deal, it just makes you faster. What, like a superhero? Exactly like a superhero. Not wearing heels, are you? Can I clear away some of these empty plates? Yeah, uh, yeah. We'll just have two pieces of banana cream pie. À mode. À la mode. Of course. - You remember the route? - Yeah. Now, you were right about that pill. I feel like a race car. - What kind? - I don't care. So are we going to do this or just start talking really quickly? Let's go. Fuck you! Whoa. Hey, hey! - Go, go now. - Get back here! Stop! Little fuckers! Get back here, goddammit! Go, go. Wallendorf! Wait! Oh, hey, don't kill him. Quiet, he's fat. Does fat mean he deserves to be hurt? Obesity is the number one killer in the country. Even if you combine war and all disease. Keep my face out of the frame with that thing. I'm not going to frame your face. Don't kill him though. This guy is like a whale. He can take a bat to the stomach. Oh fu... Oh my God. What... hey ya... Goodbye. Why...? Okay, roll down your window. Unbuckle your seat belt right after we hit the water. Get ready to swim out. Okay. Ready. Is that hidden enough? - Yeah. - Great. I mean, I would've wanted it to go under more, but doesn't make a difference now. No one's going to find it here anyway. Makes about as much sense as anything else. We could firebomb that. Would draw attention. Okay. Let's go back to the house and find the girls. - Sounds good. - Okay. Oh, hell. Cane brought Jennifer. How cool is that? - Hi, Stew. - Hello, Jennifer Wallendorf. Knock it off. Hey, can I get a pint of straight whiskey? Sure thing. It's quite a drink, little lady. Cane, Cane. Oh, beautiful Cane, thank God you're here. It is complete anarchy in the kitchen. I mean, we're just trying to make big pots of the simple potato and beet soup, a little bit of veggies, and these guys are just fucking it up in ways that I can't even describe. Okay, man, I'll come help out in a sec. - Let me just grab a quick drink. - Thank you. You are a saint. I'm sorry. One second. What the fuck are you doing? Hey Stew, I'll just have a shot of that. Don't. What the fuck? Look at this... Look at this. Does that look good to you? It's fucking disgusting. Do it again. Jennifer, take it easy with that whiskey. I got to help in the kitchen. I am taking it easy. Go do your thing. Okay, okay, relax, people. Relax. Everybody stay calm. ...it goes in the peel, you slice it... ...so much, I swear to God. - Stew, can I get another? - Of course, but I honestly think two pints of whiskey is going to make you fall down again. Stew, can you just let me live? Cut, you don't kill the flavors, it's going to... Alright, chicken broth, people, chicken broth. Let's get some chicken broth. Hi, girls, what did you get up to tonight? - Scanner? - Pleasure. - Hmm. - To be honest, it wasn't the best evening so far. We... we... we've been keeping busy. - What about you? - Hmm. Cane took me out to dinner. - He can be such a doll. - I know. Well, love's the devil. And so is Cane. Wants some angel powder? Oh yeah, put it on the back of my hand. Look at her go. Jesus Christ. Wow, that wasn't necessary. What? Was she stuck in a dark elevator as a child or something? Lean her against the wall, so she doesn't choke in her own vomit. Cane! Oh, Cane? Can you come get your girlfriend? I need a drink. Where are my clothes? Where is my purse? Well, you've got my shoe at least. Well, your clothes are right over there. - There's vomit on them. - Oh. Okay. Oh, wow. No. Hey, come here. How did I get so sick? - You don't remember? - Hmm, no. Well, you downed two straight pints of whiskey and I tried to stop you. Then you went into Cynthia's ladies only room and started snorting rails and venting with the girls. Mmm... Why are you looking at my shoe like that? Don't tell me, like, you're just one of those guys who likes my dad's shoes more than he likes me. It's not like that. I was checking out the shoe and trying to figure things out. Okay. So did you figure things out while staring at my shoe while I was passed out? Can you get me some champagne? I just don't understand all the conspiracy theories about your family. Did you know there's a whole movement where they believe your family are lizards? - Mm-hmm. - And you guys are trying to make the world hotter because it's your natural climate? It's backed up with mathematicians, scientists, as well as former Wallendorf shoes executives. Well, do you think that's true? I know you're not a lizard. What's up with the red shoes? Ugh... It's information. So, in order to get the seven-year unlimited replacement warranty, you have to give Wallendorf shoes access to all of your personal information and everything else. Once my father has access to someone's personal information, he can categorize their whole life in less than a paragraph. How much you're willing to spend on a sandwich or how much you're willing to spend on a cup of coffee, and then he'll get you to spend more or influence your behavior based off of your personality type. That's just as crazy as the lizard thing. Well, nobody wants to believe that their life can become less than a syllable in under a second. Madness. Ooh, yeah, definitely. Hey, there's no cameras allowed in here. Yeah, I know. This is an antique Polaroid camera. It's untraceable. You want me to take some pictures of you with this thing? Hm, exactly. Alright. Ah, cool, you're not dead. I think I'm alive. Mostly because of this feeling of terminal love. Well, did you ever wake up feeling like you're looking out a window at a beautiful beach with the wind in your hair? - Yeah. - Well, Mitch thinks we drank all of his beer and destroyed his motorcycle. He's been saying it for over a week and won't back down, so now Cynthia has to fight him. Mitch, Mitch, Mitch! I am the king. King! That guy is huge. I am the crusher. This isn't your dad's tower, princess. Someone's about to get hurt because of living space and food. Nothing around here is just about beer or motorcycles. - Uhh... - Clean as usual. - How's the champagne? - Cool. It's pretty clean, too. - Okay, you guys want to grab some breakfast real quick? - Yeah, go get some food. I will just make some breakfast burritos real quick. Be right back. - Nice shoes. - Yeah? Are... are you patronizing me? Do rich people eat breakfast? Or are you guys living off of champagne, - nice shoes and jewelry? - Yeah. We just survive off of champagne, and then we name fancy shoes after ourselves. How does that not make sense? - Huh? - Oh, okay. Well, Jennifer. Can you just get yourself together? Why don't you just go marry prince charming, little mermaid. You just... look at me, look at me. Girls, kind of... this... I'm going to talk. So, here's the thing, I've already taken a private jet to the Bahamas and pretty much everywhere else. I've met, like, ten Prince Charming's, and they weren't the least bit charming. Half of them were not even real princes. So bleh. Why can't you just accept that, like, maybe I am just as lost if not, maybe a little... little bit more lost than all you. Fine. But can I just give you some friendly advice about chef boy Cane over there? Yeah. Don't get too attached, sweetheart. Thinking you can hold on to Cane is like thinking you can grab smoke. Cynthia. Come on, Cynthia. - Here you go, ladies. Fresh breakfast burritos. - It's okay, just sit there and eat your breakfast while I'm up here, ready to go. - I don't eat food. - It's... - it's a private jet, just... - I don't... you don't eat private jets. [exhales Yeah. Get it on. Get it on. And fight. - Get him! - Cynthia! You squirmy little worm, I will crush you flat. Get him! Get here, girl, I'm gonna do you dirty. Get here. Oh, yeah. Oh, goddamn! Gonna rip your legs off, bitch! - Cynthia, yeah! - Come on, come on, let's go, Cynthia! Fire, prison, faster. Come to papa. I'm going to put a stick on your thighs. Gonna be dirty! Help, help! I'll kill you! I'm gonna crush you fucking flat. Cynthia! Cynthia! Come on! You got no good. I'm gonna crush you! It's okay, Cynthia, you can do it. Get up. Come on, let's go! - Yes! - Steal his breath. Stop. I give up. I was only joking. I was getting... Cynthia, come here, come on, you're okay, you're okay. Come... come on. Am I... am I alive? - We got you. - Where's Mitch? - We won. The fights over. - You did it. I can't remember the fight in my brain. I think you're better off. - It's okay. - What? - I think he's choking. - Mitch is dead. - Get it off. Get off. - You killed that big guy. They're not getting this now, girl. Come on, Mitch, get up. - Come on, Mitch. - Mitch, get up. Chad, there's rumors of you spending nights and days in Mrs. Wallendorf room with her and her maids. - Mrs. Wallendorf and her maids, huh? - Mm-hmm. Don't go spreading rumors like that about me. You know, I'm loyal to the Wallendorf family. I only do... what is asked. I know, it's not me. Rumors about you and Mrs. Wallendorf are being spread on their own. I thought you were my friend. Rumors don't get spread on their own. Somebody spreads it. I am your friend. That's why I'm telling you what everyone's talking about. I don't want you to wind up being a lead of one of Mr. Wallendorf commercials because you have a problem with self-control or something. If you need to talk about it, I'm here. I'm not very chatty. And everyone's lying. Where's your precious truck? I'm so sorry. It's all my fault. I'm going to find it soon. But your plan was flawless, and you believe in God. Who would steal ramen? There's no way anybody could have known there was gold inside. Ramen has the least spiritual, monetary or sentimental value of anything you can think of. I dropped the ball. I'm too busy for my pants. So $1.6 billion dollars worth of gold was untraceable. It was completely my fault. Someone inside the palace knows. Must be an inside conspiracy. You have to kill. You have to torture the senior staff, it's your only option. Ah... There are always traitors. That's the golden rule. I'll kill. I'll kill the staff. Oh, they all believe in God. They'll be blessed to leave this world by my merciful hands. Find out who the conspirators are. There's always lies and murder when gold is on the line. And always remember, "Murder is plan A." So you grew up in a restaurant like this one? I was helping in the kitchen since before I could reach the stove. I remember standing on a stool. Anyway, my whole family got murdered, and the restaurant was burned down. So, here's your happy ending. Wait, are you serious about that? Yeah. - Chad? - Hmm? You've seen my daughter lately? Nope. Neither have I. I suppose that makes fucking three of us. Get the rangers looking for her, huh? - Of course. - I don't understand why we can't find her with all the satellites and the digital tracking machines. She's constantly posting where she is and what she's doing. And I don't like it! It's a disgrace. She does things, like, sets up devices in different parts of the town. It's as if she wants everyone to know that she's somewhere else. Sometimes we have rangers deployed all over the city and then your cook or one of your maids finds her here eating cereal or sleeping in her room, you know? - It's great. - It's stupid. It is, it is. Just get her. Bring her back to me. Yes, sir. Chad? You got a point? Or you just going to stare at me like some weird hungry vulture all night. Sir, we believe it's time to expand. Beyond just the simple manufacturing of women's red high-heeled shoes. - Them here shoes? - Right? These here shoes? These shoes are overwhelming the planet. Ain't nothing simple about a pair of woman's shoes. Are you okay, Jennifer? Your father's been looking for you. Who asked you, doll face? Okay. - Here, let me help you. - Batch, ba... I strongly suggest you keep your hands to yourself unless you want to be the star of my first murder mystery. - I've got too many pots on my fire. - Hey, hey, hey. It's not all your fault, Mrs. Wallendorf. And I'm gonna find everything. Trust. Jennifer, Jennifer. Where have you been? Oh my God, sweetheart. You're drunk. Your hair is green, and you're covered in vomit. It's a wig, Mom. But I'm gay, and I'm leaving the church. Your depression is only due to negative thoughts. If you just breathe and stay loving God and only have positive thoughts, the whole world will change around you. I hate you. Please get out of my life. The heart of a mother is a deep abyss, at the bottom of which always find forgiveness. [Mrs. Wallendorf All of the information was coded and sent through private satellites. You can't depend on technical error. There are always traitors. You should murder this one. If the conspirators start to disappear, it will send a clear message to the others, and they'll start to talk. Make them talk or die. Either way, it's the best thing for everyone. Where's my ramen noodle soup? I know that you know where it is. You have my ramen noodle soup truck, don't you? Mrs. Wallendorf, I don't know anything about your ramen noodle soup. - Don't you? - What are you talking about? Why... why... why do you care about ramen noodle soup? But... you're a... you're... you're a good person. Let me go now and... and I will get you the best ramen noodle soup in the whole world. Do you know how much it will hurt - to be shot in the cranium with a derringer? - Oh, God. The bullet will just rattle around inside your skull. It won't kill you right away. No, it will just leave you there with your brains shuffled like a deck of cards and stirred up like oatmeal. Then you'll just choke on your own blood. Or maybe dehydrate. Do you know that it could take over 24 hours for your spirit to leave this meaningless meat that is your body? Mrs. Wallendorf, please don't shoot me. This is crazy, over ramen? I'll fly to Japan and... and I'll... I'll... I'll get you the... the most authentic ramen from the finest chef in Tokyo. Just let me go. You... you're such a good person, you're... you're such a good person. A violent death over ramen? This is... This is unnecessary. This is necessary. This is necessary. If you know anything about history or religious scripture, you would know that violence is the most natural cause of death. And since your death is imminent, I can say we both know this isn't about ramen. - It's about gold. - What? What the hell is she talking about? So a violent death over gold... Ramen is gold? Well, that's not only natural, it's necessary. Can you talk? You want me to put some mellow jazz on and dance around naked for you while you die? I'm happy to. What? What you're doing, pumpkin? Told you not to come in here with the door closed. I told you not to call me pumpkin anymore either. Well, I... I didn't come in. I'm just knocking. Fine, whatever. Come in. I don't care. Holy shit. Why do you insist on having the entire world see you in your underwear? Is that necessary? Holy shit! Some of it's even nude. You know, this is crazy. Crazy! You could be inviting stalkers, kidnappers, creepy cyber daters. I learned this from you. This is what you do with your models. I'm just so much better at it. I'm your most famous model by ten hundred times. I mean, without me, sales would drop. God, you think everything is about you. My fans love me. You know, all the social media is not really love. And what are you doing with rainbow-colored cheerios in your hair? Is that some new "I'm the most popular model in the world" look? Yes. And if you don't get it, you just don't get it. Oh, I get it. No, you don't get it, Dad. You don't get it at all. Well, why don't you just explain it to me then, pumpkin? I'm talking about something that you don't get or understand, that's why I can't explain it to you. And stop calling me pumpkin. My so-called renegade marketing is just as important as all the videos that you bombard people with through your private satellite. Can we take this conversation downstairs? Your mama had Becky in the kitchen make amazing ramen and it's topped with white truffles, gold leaf. You had Becky in the kitchen gold leaf your ramen noodle soup? I mean, you know how your mother is about food. And look who's talking, you got cereal in your hair. What's that all about? Whatever. That ramen sounds crazy though, I'm going to take a picture of it. And then I'm going to post it. Pumpkin. I can't stand those bodybuilder guys. We've already been through this. Look, a locker in the gym is the safest place to keep our computer. Maybe it was the cheapest place. You don't have to work out with those people just to make it look casual. It's like steroid cops asking me if I wanna get a protein shake with a long shower. Well, your girlfriend probably appreciates that you're fit. Let's just get to work. Well, it looks like there's a truckload of flat screen TVs coming into town tonight. Are you sure they're flat screen TVs? I don't know how that ramen noodle soup mix-up happened. I honestly think there could have been some other criminals involved or something. Or maybe a computer glitch. I don't want to hit Wallendorf shipping again. Okay, not right now. I'm not stupid. I'm not gonna put you and your bandits in more danger than I have to. This is CBA freight systems and flat screen TVs. Look at it, it's right here. Sounds good. The CBA always has those geo-fences around their trucks. I can just fry the whole system. We're actually running really low on food and even basic ingredients to make bread, so... I know. Us... bandits are hitting a supermarket for groceries. - Great. - And you and your finaglers. can figure out how to safely sell the electronics. And get whatever else we need. And then I am off for a while. - That works. - Ok. Well, stare deeply into the computer screen, you got the ETA to memorize and a location. Got it. Close your eyes, pumpkin. You want to play a game? Yes. This game is called pumpkin. Pumpkin. Pumpkin. Can I get you something to drink? Yeah. Can I, uh, have a mimosa? Just a mimosa? That'll be all. Sure. Thank you, Nathan. I'm not Nathan. Sorry, I..., uh... I fell asleep last night with the fan aimed directly at my head. Today everything looks and sounds like I'm underwater. Must have thought you were someone else. Well, she does things, like, have, um, three devices in different places around town, and she sets them up to activate and start posting things at different times. It's as if she wants everyone to know that she's somewhere else. Somewhere else. Somewhere else. Somewhere else. - Would you like another? - I'm fine, Nathan. Didn't your mother ever tell you not to sleep with the fan pointing straight at your head? You'd be lucky if you don't catch the flu or something. Oh, Nathan. Fuck you. Would you wear these two bracelets around your wrist, drive around the block for about an hour and then come back and get me? Yes, ma'am. Happy to. Thank you. What are you wearing? Look who's talking, you're in a costume. Uh, this isn't a costume. It's a disguise. What is the difference? A costume, you wear for fun. A disguise, you wear for deception. Coincidentally, I have costumes in this suitcase. What are the costumes for? Your masquerade ball. What did you think they were for? Are you inviting me to the Wallendorf palace freak out thing - that everyone talks about? - I'm not inviting you. I'm taking you. Can you hand me those bracelets back? Of course, Miss Wallendorf. What's this? Tracking device. - You have to wear it? - Yes. Is this dangerous? Well, you can't have an adventure without an element of danger. Besides, you seem to be the type who veers more towards the dangerous side of things. So... Will you stop being so dramatic? We're just sneaking into a party at my parent's house. I find it... unlikely that they'd kill you, even if they caught us. Can you wait for us? We should just be a couple of hours. Yes, of course. - Love the Wallendorf parties. - I know. Bracelets? - Enjoy. - Thank you. That keeps our spirits up. - Holy, this place is crazy. - Is it? I'm so hungover. My brain is swollen. Mine is too. ♪ Every curve was a roller coaster ride ♪ ♪ That took me right there to the hell she had inside ♪ ♪ She was fire ♪ Two whiskeys straight up. Another round, please. I love it when alcohol makes me go from completely miserable and paranoid to being forking confident in under five seconds. Me too. - Give me your bracelet. - Don't I need these? My dad's tracking us while we're wearing them. So just give it to me, and we'll make him think we're somewhere else. I mean, he already knows I'm at the bar with some guests anyway. What do we have there? Here we have some tuna carpaccio for starters and on the other side we have quiche puffs. I love quiche puffs. There. That ought to buy us a few hours. Let's go. Chocolate! This is my dad's studio. This is where he shoots all of his commercials and promotional photography and everything, really. Whoa! You mean all that crazy stuff in the commercials with landscapes and out on yachts and giant ballrooms really happens here? That's what I just said. - Can't he see us? Aren't there cameras everywhere? - No. He relies way more on tracking systems than he does on cameras. He can track people's cell phones and credit card chips and other stuff like that. Uh, he can even hear what you're saying if you're in the same room as your cell phone. And you can see through any camera that's attached to a device with internet capabilities. Why on earth would he want to do all that anyway? Well, he takes the conversations and people's personal information, stores it in his super computers, and then computers and the tech teams figure out what people are talking about. And then they sell that information off to massive corporations and to government agencies, and then they easily influence people to talk and think about whatever they want. Why? Money, religion, world domination. Well, that's scary. - I don't want to talk about it. - Yeah, most people don't. That's why it works so well. - You went back to Annabelle's? - Yeah. I can't even go there any more without a disguise, thanks to you. Hush. Thank you, Mr. Wallendorf. It's been our lifelong dream - to model for you. - Oh. I'm... I'm not saying we're not doing this just because it's cool, but everyone you put in your commercials gets a hundred thousand super fans, sponsors, and, we're just trying to express our gratitude, sir. Pleasure is all mine, son, the pleasure is all mine. Uh, now, what I'd like you to do is... I'd like you to all get in front of that green screen there and, uh, make yourself a nice little circle, alright? Now, I want you all to... What's happening? Close your eyes. Close your eyes. Now, this game is called Snafu. - I think you... - Don't talk. - Don't even breathe. - Thought it'd be a little hard... Otherwise, my dad will kill you. ...to get along without his head. That's what I was trying to say before you brought me here, princess. What we're gonna do is we're gonna take down all your parts and then put them all back together again. Alright? Here we go. Now, I want you to take your legs and put them all the way on the other side of the group. And then I want you to take your torso and put it on top of your leg. And take your head and put it on top of your neck. Now, I would like you to make a new body right over here to replace the old body. You want to play snafu with that body? Good. Now, make it two heads and put them where the hands are supposed to be and take the hands and put them where the head is supposed to be. And now, I want you to unshuffle until all there is, is one perfect body unshuffled, with no name. Now, I want you to take those revolvers. And I want you to cock them. And I want you to place them directly up to the ear of the body to your right. And I am going to count to three. And I want you to pull the trigger. Alright. And one, two, three. Cut. Well, how did look? - Was it beautiful? - I've never seen anything like that. My God. We will organize this footage to a symphony, and then we'll broadcast it at the stroke of midnight. Yes, sir. Yes, sir! That was pretty. I knew it! That's what rich people do. Well, I... I don't do that. Wait, did this make you stop loving me? Not sure if it made me stop loving you. Just made me stop loving overall. Look, my dad is a particular individual. I mean, he... he can make people do anything. Is your mom in on this? She's... she's... she's in on it. Oh, do you want to go downstairs and get another drink and then spy on my mom? I know where we can see into her room without a computer, so no one can track us. I think I want to have two more drinks than go home. You always do all the drugs. That's not true. Give me some of the devil's dandruff. Look at this guy, Cynthia. You gotta shoot him in the nuts, for sure. Hey, you want it so bad, Rebecca? You do it. I don't know if I can get a bullseye from here at all. You've been doing pretty good in target practice. It's not nearly as hard a shot as the ones who were making yesterday. It's true. You never missed the target once. This is a far more technical shot and his nuts are a moving target. Just don't panic or overthink it in your head. Fuck! Fuck me! Damn, I know I'd miss, you guys shouldn't have let me do that. I wouldn't exactly call that miss, now. Look, are you gonna let him suffer and draw attention, Rebecca? Or are you going to finish him off? Can you just do it like normal? - I'm shaking now. - No! This specimen is yours. Do it. Then I'm going to make a better world for all you boys and girls. Fuck. This is so gross. Can you just do it? Oh, it gets addictive. You'll probably start wanting to do it again in a week. I think I'm gonna get nightmares for the rest of my life. Yeah, that too. - You did it! - Alright. Let's go check out the truck, and this better be flat screen TVs like it's supposed to be. Little does she know her skin is gonna fall out. Yeah, and then her hair and her teeth will just follow. So much blood. - So many people. - I know. Their timing was impeccable. - That was weird. That was really fucking weird. - Don't worry about it. You can't tell me that wasn't weird. I can't unsee what I just saw. Well, I'm telling you not to worry about it. How do you not think that was weird? Are you really gonna spy on your mom, or did you bring me in here for sex? Ugh, don't talk about my mom and sex at the same time. That's gross. Totally not a turn on. Sorry, it's just a really confusing position. Pour some whiskey in my mouth. Please, don't use the power drill on me. This is complete madness. In a mad world, only the mad are sane. He's trying to convince you that you're crazy. Go away with him. We both know that you know why I have to do this to you. No, no, no, no, no. I could reschedule for next week about drilling a hole in your brain, but I'm sorry. I'm just too busy for that. It is what it is. I dropped the ball, too busy for my pants. Mm, it's all my fault. Many blessings. Your mom is completely out of her mind. She's talking to herself. She's about to drill a hole in that poor guy's head. I know. Let's watch. - You watch, I want to go home. - Give me a sec. I don't know anything about your ramen noodle food truck. - Yes, you do! - No, I don't. I'm feeling claustrophobic and nauseous, can you take me home? Look, it is completely up to you whether or not you want to tell the truth. Okay. You have the power to do anything you want. What do ramen packets have to do with business or... or anything I would even know about. Mrs. Wallendorf. No, no, no, no, no! - Get me out of here. - Hey... Hey, don't panic, okay? We can go back to your place now. You know, I'm actually kind of sad that my mom killed Rick. I've known him my whole life. Oooh! You guys look like you're getting ready to do something exciting. You guys look like you just did something exciting. Yeah. What's up with the costumes? I always knew rich people were crazy, but I was wrong. They're really, really, really crazy. We just came from my parent's annual masked ball. Exactly. That shit was not normal. I don't even know how to explain what I just saw with words. It does sound like something. So, what are you guys getting up to? We're actually going to hit up a supermarket. - Can I come? - You want to rob the supermarket with us? And I want to see this crazy... fancy masked ball. So I'll let you come with us on this robbery. If you bring me to your parent's next party at their castle. There's gonna be another crazy party there in a few weeks so we won't even have to wait the whole year. Cool. Cane? Why don't you go change into some normal clothes? And Jennifer, you can borrow some of ours. - Okay. - Okay. - Have you ever killed a man? - No. Not directly. Well, there's this one incident with one of my super fans, and he said he would kill himself if I didn't fly to his apartment to give him a kiss. Yeah, I know. And then he hung himself and posted it. I think it would be a lot cleaner for your energy if you just... ...killed someone directly. Jennifer, take the machete and go make your father proud. Anyone with a heart only tastes death once. Just, uh, skip on over there and, uh, turn that security guard into sashimi. And he won't even recognize you're a threat until it's too late. Well, I'm... I'm... I'm scared. In fact, that guy probably has a gun. Aw... Cowards die many times before their deaths. What the fuck? Good night. Let's go. Hit it again! Hey, get off. Cane, get out of my way. Well, that was a bit disorganized. Whoa, yeeha! Get it, like, meat, meat. - Oh God, it's stuck! - Go, giddiup. Oh... Okay. Okay, cool. Let's go, let's go. What are you doing? Why is your helmet off? There's cameras everywhere. You're so anxious to hit the ball and so afraid that you won't, you can't even see the beauty of the fruit. That looks pretty good. That? Wow. Ah, it's good. It's like an explosion of flavors in my mouth. What kind of steak is that? - Good cows. - Hm. I think we should hit a house next. I don't do home invasions. This is not cool. I've tracked a handful of people on social media. They have, like, $100,000 diamond rings and crazy necklaces and jewelry cases. If you hit one of these houses, I think we can make, like, hundreds of thousands of dollars. No joke. Families are in houses. Cane, women and children. That's different than the truck drivers, security guards. I understand about not wanting to hurt any children. But why no women? You kill guys all the time. Why wouldn't you kill a woman? Staying away from women and children is customary. I think you just like killing men. - What? - Killing men. I think you've justified it in your brain, and you enjoy murdering men. Mhm... Cane, you've been a missing person since you were, like, nine. If you disappeared, it wouldn't even count because you're already not here. A lot of people like to put stuff in their bags, but I personally just like to put more bags. The great thing about this one is you could fit a lot. What are you drinking? I just stick to straight tequila. I'm glad everyone's enjoying all the fancy cocktails, but fancy drinks make me sick. Yeah, me too. Mm-hmm. That's why I'm... I'm... I'm drinking straight whiskey. Straight whiskey. I love you all so much. Stew, can I get more coconut rum in here? And vodka and berries and want to add some whipped cream on top? But you sure you don't want the berries on top? Because if I put the berries under the whipped cream, - then it's gonna taste a little... - Do as I say! Oooh... Cherries, cherries and rum... - Come on, Stew. - Make it fast, hurry up. At your service. Now kiss me. You mean right now? When do you think I mean? I just wasn't sure, uh, sometimes you make me nervous. You have a lot of demands. Yeah? I'm demanding? - Mm? - Mm-hmm. Get it, girl. - Did you like that? - Okay, I'm not really good at this. And what I mean by that is... that I did. Me too. You wanna a sip of my drink? - Mm-hmm. Okay. - Oh, he's like a little baby. It's good. Ha-ha! Wow, well how about this? - I'm sorry, did I make you mad? - No. You're like my favorite person. Can you make me another drink with this straw for each of us? - Thank you. - Don't mess it up, Stew. Oh, straw... straw. You said I was your favorite person. You are. Oh, I think we should give these to some space. Wanna go hang out over there? Oh, okay. One of the funniest ones was when we accidentally jacked a ramen noodle soup truck. - Oh, um... - You okay there? Ramen truck? Why did you, um, jack a ramen truck? I was... it was a mistake. To be honest, it was supposed to be Wallendorf shoes, but. We just... we just ditched in a swamp. Huh. What, um... what swamp? Why? Well, um, I was just wondering if you could take a picture of me in front of the truck, so I could post it online. You can't have a phone or any electronics here or near the truck. - We... you... - I know the rules. The only thing I ever bring with me is this antique Polaroid camera. They can't be traced. I will take you to the truck. If you tell me - the truth about the red shoes. - What do you mean? I mean, they're... they're just red shoes. Keep talking, I'll show you the truck. Okay. - Catch up. - Uh, Okay. So you're saying the populace sell their soul for a pair of red shoes that they buy? You want to pose for the picture? [Cynthia} I don't think she's gonna be conscious anytime soon. Just go home. I'm not worth fighting over. Cane, you're mine. Pumpkin. He's yours, pumpkin. Jennifer, it's not what it looks like. It's not what it looks like. It's not what it looks like. Jennifer... Jennifer, it's not what it looks like. Yeah, it's... it's not what it looks like. It's... It's what it feels like. Jennifer... Jennifer, wait. Jennifer, wait. Jennifer. Fuck! Hold, hold. Hold. Thank you, thank you. Many blessings. I can't see. I feel dizzy. You're okay? Ah, perfect. That's perfect. I'm okay, I just... just didn't eat enough today. Well, eating was our original plan when we came into the kitchen. And that's why I made you a delicious, healthy, vegan ramen. You should do what I do. - What is that? - Every morning, I have an entire block of tofu with absolutely nothing, completely raw. - Yeah? - Then, no matter what happens, I'm properly nourished throughout the day. Really? That is delicious. Mmmm! Oh my... So, all the gold in the entire ramen noodles trunk are gone? Officially? Without a... without a trace? - I'm such an idiot. - No. - It's all my fault. - No, no, no. I did everything right. I don't know how this could have happened. You know what they say about plans, right? "Best plan B is to do plan A again." - Do the whole thing all over again? - Mm-hmm. It took years. I am confident that between the two of us, we can transport over six billion dollars in untraceable gold. Then we can still fly away to that secret palace in Fiji. - That's right. - Oh... You're such a blessing. I'm sick of my degenerate daughter and my power crazed husband drinking out of my cup and putting pots on my fire. Oh, baby. Come here. Family values, human relationships, these are the seeds upon which all success grows. What do you say to all the people who think your commercials and photography are unclassy, vile and encourage violent crimes and suicide. Well, you know, it's hard, darling. I consider myself above all else an artist and a self-help guru. What do you think about the rumors circulating and the theories that your commercials are real? What do you think about the rumors circulating that the earth is flat? Everyone wants to know why you only make red shoes. Do you ever have any intentions of making other clothes or other colors of shoes? My sense of art and design start and stop at red women's shoes. Mr. Wallendorf, what about shoes for men? What about it? Men wear my shoes. Everybody knows men love my shoes. I'm not going to change my design to cater to a male market. [woman One more question. Why did you have to cheat on me when I was passed out downstairs? I mean, what were you thinking? Is there anything I can do? Can I get some more champagne, Nate? Of course. You know, my name is not Nathan. Do you know who I am? You're Jennifer Wallendorf. Do you want me to make you the most famous bartender in town, Nate? Of course. What do you have in mind? Make out with me. I'll film it, post it and tag you in it. What's the catch? There's no catch. Now, uh, get us two shots of tequila, pour yourself a glass of champagne, and let's do this. I challenge you to a fight and the loser's penalty is permanent banishment. Well, Jennifer, you're even crazier than I thought. Oh yeah, way crazier than you thought. I don't want to have to hurt you. Just be one of my girls. Yeah? Like everybody else. You have no choice. Maybe you have no choice. I mean, they are your stupid laws. You really want to fight me? And the loser gets banished forever. I thought you were my friend. So yeah, now I'm gonna banish you and not just that, I'm gonna beat you to a pulp. - You sure? - Mm-hmm. You're cute. I am. Thank you. Why don't we go over to the bar and have Stew write up some combat rules? - Great. - Great. Stew! Can I get you ladies a drink? - No. - No. Stew, combat rules. Who's fighting? Jennifer is challenging me. You're... you're drunk, and you're planning to use the bartender... I get it. - It's not a joke. - Well, if it's not a joke, it sounds like a really bad plan. I already tried convincing her not to do it. Yeah, she's insisting on combat. Okay, well, my job is to write down the rules. I don't... want to get challenged. Jennifer, you should make the choices in regards to weapons and rules. We will fight naked. What? If you want to back out now, I guess you're just gonna get banished forever. Hey, I don't want to back out. I just think naked is a stupid outfit. I don't want to hurt you that bad. Yes, you do. Okay. I guess tomorrow we will fight naked, and I will knock you out and then make sure you're safe when you're unconscious. And then I'll leave you in a wheelbarrow in the middle of town. Great, except you're gonna be the one that's gonna be in the wheelbarrow. Okay, so let's get back to the point. We're gonna fight naked except for Wallendorf red high-heel shoes, which will be duct-taped to our feet. And the fight will be tomorrow at high noon. I agree. I suppose love and gold are somewhat similar. There's always murder involved when the other one is on the line. How's it going? Um, I'm fine. I always eat a steak before a fight or a heist. It's the only time I eat red meat. Yeah, make sense. Would you consider fooling around with me tonight before the fight? Crazier and crazier, Jennifer. Was that, like, your last wish? Fool around before I beat you up and banish you forever? Yes. I don't normally fool around with girls. But if it's the famous and infamous Jennifer Wallendorf's last wish, then... I'll do it. I might need an extra glass of wine or two first. You're playing it cool, but I know you want to. Do you wanna play a game? Sure, whatever you want. Okay. This game is called... put daddy in the room. Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Cynthia! Wait, wait, wait. It's past noon. Let's go check her room. Cynthia! Cynthia! No. Cut her down. Hey, pumpkin. Told you not to call me that. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just an old habit. When you were a baby, you were such a little pumpkin. That's okay. I'm not a pumpkin anymore. And you are a megalo-narcissist. Shit. I don't even know what a megalo-narcissist is. It's someone like you. - Mm-hmm. - You've made what, half the world dependent on you, Dad? You're like a boy band, corporate kingpin. A pop singer with rhythm, but no soul. What kind of language is this, pumpkin? You playing a game with me? I know there's no red shoes, Dad. You're gathering people's personal information, storing it in your supercomputer and then selling it off to the highest bidder. You're a wizard... turning people into frogs just for fun. But you're nobody. You are absolutely nobody. My, my, my. I guess my little girl has grown up. No more reason to call you pumpkin, is there, Jennifer? There's no red shoes. It's a house of cards, smoke and mirrors. Well, Dad. When you live in a house made of cards, you shouldn't play with fire. I'm initiating the congratulations game. You can't initiate the congratulations game. Yes, I can. - No, you can't. - Yes, I really can. No, you cannot initiate the congratulations game. I'm the only one that can do that. It's encrypted. Voice, facial, retina recognition software. It is my most protected program. How many of your super fans do you want me to kill, Dad? A hundred thousand? Maybe more. Pumpkin. It is impossible for you to initiate the congratulations game. - Hello? - Congratulations. Congratulations. - Hello. - Congratulations. - Hello? - Congratulations. - Hello? - Congratulations. You just won a five-star trip to the moon in a body bag. Sweetheart. What are you doing? You stole my gold? No, I didn't. Chad did. That's all my fault. I should have known. You should have known but you didn't. Now you know. Murder Chad. Get the gold and take your daughter to Fiji instead. Mom, what are you doing? Of course it was Chad. How did you know there was gold inside? And how did you know where to find the truck? Well, Chad took me to the truck, and then he took this picture of me, and then he kissed me, and said he wanted to marry me, and that he was gonna take me away from all of this with the gold, and we'd go wherever I wanted, Fiji or anywhere else. What did you do? Instead of going to my room? I came here to show you the picture and... and tell you what happened. Of course. This is such a blessing. Can you go get Chad and bring him here? We'll have to kill him before we go to Fiji. Okay, I'll get him. Even though the core business is a smaller part of the pie than it was last year. It's actually grown. It's just that all the other businesses are also growing and even multiplying. Miss Wallendorf. Can we help you with something? My mother would like to see you, Chad. - Really? - Yeah. Come on. Excuse me. Jennifer. Your mom is not here. Well, hey. Oh, oh... Oh, wow. You did good, Chad. What happened? You did good. Let go, my darling angel. Your spirit is free. Free! Free! Okay. Mom, mom, mom, I think... I think Chad's dead now. You can never be sure with these tough guys, sweetheart. You've got a double kill them. Make sure they're good and dead. And you can be pretty sure they're dead, but it's really hard to kill someone. It's not like in the movies, where you just stabs the guy and he falls down. You really got to make sure they're good and dead in real life. Okay, I get it. Chad's definitely dead. He's gone. No more Chad. I'll just get him one more time for the brains. Uh, welcome. By now, I'm pretty sure that he's gone, sweetheart. - So what's the plan now? - I'm gonna radio, and I'm gonna have the largest jet fueled up and put on the runway, then you... you... you're gonna bring me to this truck. We'll get the gold, we'll put it on the jet... Do we have enough fuel to get from here to Fiji? No problem. Did you know the plane has a navigation system in it that's actually easier to use than a car? I know how to land the jet, mom. Oh, yes. So what are we gonna do in Fiji when we land with all the gold? The Fijians are such good people. You're gonna love them. They have top chefs and wine because of all the tourism. The local cuisine is to die for. - Jennifer? - Oops. Don't drop the gold. It was an accident. What are you doing? I just wanted to say thank you to everyone and, um, goodbye. This is a celebration. Cheers. Mmm... Did it look real? Yeah, it looked real. - I thought you were dead. - Aw... That was just a very basic special visual effect. I have a jet filled with gold, and we're going to fly to Fiji in it and stay in my family's secret castle. This is different. My parents are dead. Everyone thinks I'm dead. No one knows that this place exists. So you and I are gonna fly the jet to Fiji, and then it's gonna fly back without us. Come on. Follow me. Might as well at this point. How did this happen? You were all friends with Jennifer Wallendorf? We're just as surprised as you are. We were friends of Jennifer's, but we didn't know her parents. It felt so good to be bad. We are going to drink to Stew and to all of the wonderful bad girls. Okay, but why? I left Wallendorf shoes to the crew, along with everything else that my family owns. Well, I'll drink to that. But why? Those kids can't run a massive global corporation? You just left one of the biggest businesses in the country to a handful of drugged out hooligans. Exactly. Uhm, okay. You know how to fly this thing? You can't ask that question now. You should have asked before we got on the jet and you put your seatbelt on. Well, what's the answer? Aren't you supposed to pull up or something? Aren't you supposed to pull up or something? Aren't you supposed to pull up or something? We intend to honor her last wishes and we will do our best to run her family's corporations. With sorrow, we embrace our new fortunes. This game is called... Atcha, atcha, atcha...
