Orleans, Thursday 27 March. My Dear Friend, The idea of marrying our children pleases me. But I don't know what you will think of this idea of my son's. He has asked to be allowed to visit your house disguised as his valet, while his valet takes his role. Dorante is aware of the gravity of his commitment and hopes that his temporary disguise will allow him to know your dear daughter better.

Freely adapted from Marivaux's Game of Love and Chance Why are you speaking on my behalf? I thought on this occasion you'd feel as anyone else would. Your father asked me if you agree to his idea of marriage, if it pleases you. I answered that it does. It's not for you to anticipate my heart. My heart is like any other. What makes yours such a rare specimen? If she dared, she'd call me "original". If I had your status, then we'd see. You vex me, Lisette. I don't mean to. What harm did I do in telling your father that you'd be glad to marry? First, you didn't speak the truth. I'm happy to be single. And what if he's not to my taste. You won't marry your father's choice? I don't know. They say he's chosen a very honest gentleman. In his prime... kind, handsome... of true intent and of excellent character. Could you want more? Could you imagine a sweeter marriage, or more pleasing union? Yes. In your own description. And what people say is no more than words. Who really knows him? Men often give false impressions. Especially those of true intent. Mr So-and-So seems gallant and is thought honest. Mr So-and-So seems gallant... So they said of Ergaste. His demeanour spoke true. Trust in that gentle, kindly demeanour, which in a flash changed into something dark, pinched and brutal and cast fear through the house. Ergaste married. His wife and children only know his dark side, while others know the gentle demeanour, that we were shown. Is Léandre not pleasing to the eye? But at home, he is taciturn: he never smiles or scolds. He is icy, withdrawn and aloof and inspires tedium and boredom in those around him. Is that a pleasant husband? Your account is chilling to hear. And Tersandre? As yes... Tersandre... Yesterday, I arrived and was shown in. I was greeted by a pleasing, well-mannered young man. He conversation was deliciously light. He smiled with his eyes and his mouth. Dishonesty. He had just finished chastising his wife. I found her, dejected, ashen-faced, her eyes red with tears. I found her as perhaps I will be. I pitied her, Lisette. As perhaps you will pity me. Lisette serves Silvia. She dresses her styles her hair, washes her clothes and tidies her room. She keeps company when Silvia grows bored. Lisette lives above Silvia, in a little attic room. Her life pleases her; she knows no other. Lisette has no dreams other than marriage. A husband... 1.45 pm, Boulevard des Batignolles. My daughter, I know marriage frightens you, the more so as you don't know Dorante. Dorante is here to marry you. On my last trip out of Paris, his father and I agreed your marriage, provided you both like each other. Your kindness is overwhelming, father; I will obey you. I command it. But may I be so bold as so to request a favour that would greatly reassure me. Speak. I will grant you all I can. My wish is within your gift, but I fear I ask too much. Ask, please. To be good enough, I will be too good. Could I see Dorante and inspect him without him knowing me... Lisette could play along. She could take my place, while I took hers. I don't know what you will think of this idea of my son's. He has asked to be allowed to visit your house disguised as his valet, who will himself take his master's role. Dorante recognizes the gravity of his commitment, and says that he hopes this temporary disguise will allow him to know your dear daughter better. Mario, your sister, is concerned to know Dorante better. She doesn't know his plan, and has herself asked to play the same trick and observe Dorante, just as Dorante wants to observe her. What do you say? What do you advise? Should I tell your sister? Things have happened this way, so I will not change them. We should let them both follow their ideas. Perhaps he will like my sister, even as a maid, and that will please her. I allow your disguise. Are you sure you can do it? I, father? You know who I am. For their greater comfort and convenience, The eminent Mr Orgon decides to put everyone up at the Westminster, on the Rue de la Paix. 2nd arrondissement Rue de la Paix Hôtel Westminster Orleans-Paris, 1.07 pm. 4.32 pm: Dorante announces himself at reception. Mr Orgon. I'm here to marry. The formality of the ceremony is all that remains. It's a formality worth thinking about. Yes, but only once. I'll tell Mr Orgon. And my wife, too. Tell her that I can hardly wait. An angel passes. Silvia invites him to be seated. Dorante doesn't dare. "Excuse me." Dorante secretly rehearses his role as valet. No-one comes. He looks at the paintings. You have surely been informed. I serve Mr Dorante, who has sent me with his respects while he awaits you himself. You serve him well. Lisette, what do you think of this young man? Me? I think he is promising and very welcome here, sir. I do my best, Miss. "Miss"? Is that really necessary? Address each other as befits you. You're "Lisette". And what is your name? Bourguignon, at your service. So, Bourguignon. So, Lisette. At your service, Madam. Why do you speak so formally? I await permission to speak otherwise. Please, address me as you wish, Bourguignon. Thank you, Lisette, and I ask you to do likewise. He's well mannered. A lucky maid will have him. What is this princess in servant's clothes? We'll see how she handles herself. It should be quite a show. Tell me, Lisette, is your lady as fine? Leave love aside, and let's be friends. No more? Both of your requests are impossible. They must be done. They say I'm to marry a man of means, and I have sworn to attend to no others. And I have sworn the same for women. I will only love a woman of high society. Stick to your plan. Perhaps I'll be able to. Not all know their status. I wanted to say something, but I've forgotten what. You have made me forget myself, too. - Goodbye. - Lisette... Meanwhile, Lisette awaits instructions. Yes? Evening. My good sir, do excuse our lateness. Please, it's nothing. My daughter is dressing. Shall we take some refreshment? I never say no to a drink. Bouffes Parisiens The following morning. Silvia slept well in her little bed. Dorante is keen to see her. Arlequin, still buzzing, hasn't slept. Lisette, nervously does her lashes. They get back in character. Sir. What is it, Lisette? I have to speak to you. What is it? I must explain to you certain things you should know. It's my duty. - It must be serious. - It is. Very. You allowed Miss Silvia's disguise. I thought it was nothing, but I was wrong. If you don't take things in hand, your future son-in-law won't want to marry your daughter. You think he won't appreciate my daughter's charms? That's not what I mean. But you're underestimating mine. Oh! My compliments, Lisette. Please don't make fun of me. I tell you again: Dorante is feisty. He likes me a lot. First he'll love me. Then he'll adore me. If he does, let him marry you. What? - You won't stop him? - No. Be careful, sir: I've been holding him back. I could let him run wild. Dig your spurs in... Marry him, if you like. You can have him. They said they'd bring my wife and her father. You mean Mr Orgon and his daughter. Yes. My wife and her father. I'll tell Mr Orgon. - You mean my father-in-law. - Not yet. - I'm here to marry. - It's not done yet. Well, I like that! The Westminster, 4 pm. Did my daughter speak to you? Does she like him? She's sad and dreamy. She wants me to turn him away. I say you can't. How is the valet behaving? Does he like my daughter? He's unusual. He's taking airs with her, because he's handsome. He looks at her and sighs... Does that trouble her? You're wrong. A valet wouldn't bother her. She blushes. Tell her the valet is turning her against his master. She blushes. If she gets angry... - It's my business. - She blushes. You promised me... I gave you instructions. I'll do better. I'll be sad. I'll cry, if I have to. Chance is strange. They're both out of place. Silvia's dislike of Arlequin is limitless. As for Dorante... No! No! No! The idea of marrying Lisette is a nightmare. Arlequin is following his heart. Dorante reflects. "I'm falling in love." Dorante's awkwardness attracts Silvia. She blushes... While the would-be lovers are falling in love. Silvia plays her role. But she's not fooling anyone. Silvia can't accept that she's falling for Dorante. "A high-society woman can't love a valet." Arlequin is starting to believe the dream. Dorante is angry and warns him off Lisette. Stay back. Be serious. Dissatisfied, even. Hear me? Arlequin has to renounce his love. The rules are decreasingly clear. Silvia? Look at me. You seem embarrassed. Me, father? Why would I be embarrassed? I'm quite the same as usual. It's just your imagination. Something's bother you, my sister. Something in your head? I don't think so. Is that boy the source of the disdain you have for his master? Who? Dorante's servant? Yes. Young Bourguignon. Don't talk to me about him. We thought he must have turned you against him. I'd like to speak to you about that. There's no point. Nobody turned me against him. Come on now. That's a bit strong. Someone must have helped you. What strange ideas you have. Who do you think might have helped me? What a mood you're in, my sister. I'm fed up with this role. People look at and speak to me in the strangest manner. You're the strange one. You're so worked up I hardly recognize you. That must be why Lisette told us what she did. She said that the valet had not spoken highly of his master and... Madame defended him so vehemently that I still feel shocked. It was the word, "shocked," that seemed strange. Impertinence. That girl is quite despicable. I admit that I defended him from a sense of justice. That's not wrong. What have I done? Are you playing with me? - Calm down. - No, father. I will not calm down. You're accusing him wrongly. You're wrong. Lisette is crazy. He's innocent. And that's it. The valet is the only one under suspicion. Dorante should sack him. Oh, this disguise! If only I could declare myself. The only thing I ask, my daughter, is that you know the man you're refusing. Wait a while longer. You'll thank me for it. I tell you, you'll marry Dorante... willingly. I still can't believe what I heard him say. Lord knows what servants must really think of us. They treat us so badly. I can't get over it. I can't stand to think of his words. They frighten me. He's a valet. It's so strange. Bourguignon. That's who I'm so worked up over. It's not his fault. That poor boy... I shouldn't be cross with him. Silvia dreams of Dorante... And Dorante has fallen for Silvia. He loves her. He dreams of her at night... and during the day. But Silvia avoids him. It causes him pain. And her, too. "Who could I love instead..." Suite 418, 3.08 pm. Someone is here. Sir. May I speak to you? It's your valet. See what he wants, sir. Just one word, sir. If says two, I'll sack him. - Excuse me, my queen. - Go ahead... Dorante has gone out to calm down. "Why won't you see me?" "Leave me!" "But Lisette!" "No, I can't!" Silvia needs to talk. Meanwhile, suite 328. - Yes? - Ah, Madame. I was going to say something nice, but my mind's gone blank. It'll come. - Do you think so? - Good question. What can I do? I'm burning up. Give me just a few words... Tell me you love me. Well... I love you. Maybe you'll love me less when you know me better. I'm not what you think. Remember: we don't control our destiny. Swear eternal love. With all my heart. A husband. Someone's coming. - What do you want? - To speak to you. Come back in fifteen minutes. I have to speak to my lady, sir. You can't come in like this. It's very important. - Send her away. - Come back in a minute. - But, Madame... - You're starting to annoy me. Let me calm you down. These servants... You're brave to put up with him without trying to foist him on me. My word... I can't do two jobs at once. Either I'm the lady or the maid. I order or I obey. As he's not here, I speak as your lady. I don't like that man. You've hardly seen him. His manners don't need to be seen twice. I don't want him. You'll get me out of here by telling that young man you won't marry him. I can't, Madame. You can't? Why ever not? Mr Orgon forbade me. - Forbade you? - Absolutely. Then convey my distaste to him. But what is so disagreeable, so off-putting about him? He displeases me, as does your reserve. I've never seen you like this. I can't feel your distaste. Remember who I am. - What is this? - I don't know. Five minutes later, vestibule. I have to go. Bourguignon, leave it... I shouldn't care... and I don't. I don't want you. I don't and won't love you. That's how I feel. That's awful. You're torturing me. Goodbye. I should have gone immediately. If you only knew my condition. It couldn't be as strange as mine. - What don't you like? - Nothing. Tell me a hundred times you won't love me. I beg you. Bourguignon, get up. Someone might come. I don't hate you. Get up. I'd love you if I could. What? If I was rich and of social standing, you wouldn't reject me? - Of course not. - Really? Yes. Now get up. It's a shame to interrupt you. I can't stop him kneeling. You go so well together. - I need to speak to you, Lisette. - I'll go. You should speak of your master with more respect. - Me? - Yes, you. - What do you mean? - Goodbye. We'll hear your excuses later. An hour later. My heart is in pain. I don't understand why I feel this way. It's so difficult. I don't want to see anyone, no-one pleases me, not even myself. The child I once was torments me Though she's kind she's too strong in me She spares me nothing She leads me astray And changes my mind The child I was is cruel She's stuck in my heart She's overwhelming She's incessant How can I subdue her? She's demanding and greedy for love The child in me is strong She wants to be more than a lover and she's haunted by death I'd like her to sleep I'd like to make her smile To grant her wishes She complains incessantly Who'll take her hand and talk of the future? I can't get rid of her She's always there Looking at the ground Longing for the sun Dreaming with the bees Picking red currants She loves the sound of water The beads of love on her skin She just takes She's delirious She's self-pitying I often hate her grasping ways She doesn't recognize flowers or colours Laughter and tears are the same to her Oh, gentle child Let me live But the next day... Lisette. I have to tell you something for your employers. - Tell them yourself. - Listen. This will change everything. I'm listening. - It's a secret. - I won't tell anyone. I've opened my heart to you. - I can't help loving you. - I see. Well, I can help listening to you! I'm not Bourguignon. Who are you? - I... - I'm listening! I... I wanted to know your lady before marrying her. My father allowed me to disguise myself. It's like a dream. I hate the woman I'm to marry and love her servant, who should find in me only a master. What should I do? The man with your lady is not who you think. "Hide my identity." I'm Dorante. Some time later... "He's not Bourguignon, my brother, he's Dorante!" "Who do you mean?" "I know everything. He told me himself!" "Calm down!" "Dorante and I are meant to be together!" "It's the strangest twist of fate, but the happiest..." "Are you sure he loves you?" "You're right. I need to be sure." "How should I find out?" "Test him to the limit: Make him jealous." Mario agrees to play the jealous lover. Did you tell Lisette? It's hard not to speak to her of love. How did she take it? Lightly. You're witty. - You're not fooling? - No. What would you think if Lisette loved me? You speak well, for a valet. It's the only way I know. Is that how you tried to win her over? You speak like a gentleman. I'm just as I am. Restrain yourself! I forbid you to speak to her. Not because I think she loves you. She's too good for that. But I don't want Bourguignon as a rival. And Bourguignon doesn't want you as one either. Dorante is at his wits' end. "Mario says he loves you!" "It's not my fault, Dorante!" "Do you like him?" Don't mock my happiness. Don't block my way. You want me to make a fool of a good man and let you marry his daughter in my name? If I tell her I'm a valet and she still loves me, won't you let the bells ring? As soon as they know who you are it'll be over. It would be ungrateful not to love him. I never saw a man in such vexation. I'm please to see him hoist by his own petard. How far has he got, my sister? I've got reason to be happy. Do you think he'll give his hand to you as you stand? I hope so, father. I need my victory to be total. I want his love to battle reason. And his reason to die. Monday 7 April Sir, you said I could have Dorante... Lisette. Let's see what she wants. Sir, you said I could have Dorante. I've done it. I've thought of myself. What should I do now? Will my lady give him up? I give him to you. What? You both want me to marry him? Yes. So do I. I thank you all. Wait. There's one condition. You have to say a little of who you are. But if I say a little, he'll know everything. I've suffered in your absence. Were you avoiding me? No, darling. But you were pressing for marriage and I didn't have my father's permission to answer. I've spoken to him and he says you may ask him for my hand. When you like. Before I ask him, allow me to ask you. Is your love solid? Why? Will it take what I have to ask of it? - Will it accept lowliness? - You're not... I'm... Who are you? Have you ever seen counterfeit money? Would you recognize a dud gold coin? What's your name? - My name... - Well? - Do you hate servants? - Servants? Yes. A manservant. "A manservant"? Am I not speaking to Dorante? "He's my boss!" "If you prefer love to glory..." "My glory pardons you." "Dear lady, my love will be truly grateful!" "A manservant is well worth..." ...a hairdresser. "A hairdresser" ? She's my boss. So to speak. A change of name doesn't change your face. Sir, I'm your servant. And I'm your valet, Madam. Meanwhile... How cold. I'm doing my best. I should inform you, we're sending for a lawyer. You should declare yourself. I intend to. I'm going. I'll leave a note for Mr Orgon. "Going"? Don't you agree? I don't know your reasons, so I can't agree. And I wouldn't ask for them. You can guess them. But I... I could presume, but I wouldn't be so vain. Or so brave. Goodbye, Lisette. You're really going? Then I don't love him. I won't marry him. I won't call him back. It would be strange if he went. He's stopping, turning his head... He's going. It's over. What an end. I love him. I've got something to say. I love you. I respect you. Rank and fortune are nothing compared to you. My heart and hand are yours. I've made it. What love! I love you. Repeat. Echo me, princess. I love you. The End. Subtitles: Eclair Group
