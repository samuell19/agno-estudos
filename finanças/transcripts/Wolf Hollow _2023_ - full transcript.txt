Hey, Ray. I wanted to thank you for having us all out here. Your brother won't get mad we're all out here? He just wants me to be happy, Kitty. I like the way you call me Kitty. You wanna come play? I'd rather watch. Okay. Holy shit. Gonna go check that plumbing. -Did you hear that? -Hey. No, no. It's probably just Ronnie taking it too deep as usual. -No. Stop! -No, no. I heard something. Matt! Oh, my God! Fuck! -This way! -Let's go! Come on! Fuck this. I'm going home. No, no, no, no! Wanna play fetch or something? Maybe-- Maybe I got a treat for you. Rise and shine on all my Orrstownies. This J. Brownstone. It looks like after a year we're gonna finally be getting that merger we've been hearing rumors about. Orrstown County will officially be absorbing that little Podunk speck known as The Hollow out in Wolf County. Tim, this map is bullshit. You would blame the guide. It's the first time being in a production together in two years and the first time out we get lost. You go, we go. What is that from? Are you quoting something? Lucky, is that a quote from a movie or something? You tell me, man, I only work here. It sounds like you're quoting something. I can never tell with you. It's the way you say it. Hey, Alex, we're almost outta gas. That should put us at the lodge after four if we stop. Love a woman who thinks ahead. Speaking of my mom, you should probably call her. Uh, was her getting you on set her way for-- -Getting you to call her. -Yeah. - Totally. - Benji, as long as we stay following Jill, we'll be set. I mean, since we're out here in Bumpkinville. Sorry. No offense, Ray. None taken. Trust me. It's Pennsyltucky out here, guys. Pennsa-- what? Pittsburgh on the left. Philly on the right. And, uh, Kentucky right up the middle. Fuck! I have to call the lodge about Marla's bath arrangements. -They didn't confirm? -They did. But Marla wants flowers picked today for her bath. It's to be expected, Alex, this level of diva. It's pretty common on bigger productions like this. Suck a dick. What was that? Ladies, I will separate you two if I have to. It can always be worse. Here I am. It's worse. I hate this film already. How do they expect me to relieve myself in that-- that porcelain toilet. Oh, Jesus, Marla. It's like a dump truck in there. Grow up, Beth. I'm on a cleanse. Twila, come. We must discuss... the bathtub situation. I got it. Just a small fix. Good afternoon, Sheriff. Marcus, darling, any decent coffee in this town? I warned you. None of us wanted to move to this shithole to begin with. Well, if you looked in the group chat, I said it was a big mistake. Mayor still with the Rossis? Do you feel that Wolf Hollow and Orrstown has the potential to be your next big development? All right, let's pump the brakes, everyone. These are exploratory talks right now, all right? Mr. Mayor, no. So how long this has been going on, Mr. Mayor? -So, Bart's running late? -Oh, as always. Well, the town's praying for y'all, Evie. -Thank you, Kyle. -The Neuris. Hey, Mrs. Neuri. Naomi Gavin, Orrstown News. Okay. You know what? It was no comment last week and it's no comment today. Well, actually, I haven't asked my question. And when you do-- Is it true that you and Bart here are thinking of selling the property to get out from behind the-- Are you still talking? Okay, please. Oh, my God. No comment! The Neuris could not be reached for comment. Hey, how you doing? I don't think you're listening, Mr. Neuri. -I am, Miss Rossi. -About time. Just don't like what I'm hearing. None of us do. It's not right. It's not fair. It's bullshit. Better secure that lip, girl. Or what Mayor Shitmark? All right, let's fact face over here. All right? That little animal slaughter you had at your house last year cost everybody. Now you're in the shit. May have caused a financial strain. May have caused? Lawsuits, bribing officials, negligence alone should cost you 15 years, boy. My God. I mean, all of that blood just-- makes my skin crawl. Thank you, Sylvester. Always welcome, madam. I got a merger down there with Orrstown County. -You're now, uh-- -82. $82,000 back in damages and taxes. -We've got options. -You did. -We've got time. -You don't. -What have we got? -One big shit mark. -Listen, you bitter fucks-- -Just stop! Okay? Why don't the two of you wait outside. Look, we all know what happened at your little fun park. What are we looking at realistically here? 90 days, 82 grand. -We'll get there. -Over my dead body. I'll remember that. - Goddammit! - Hey! Hey! Hey! We can't do this. Listen, it's gonna be okay. Gus, Abby and I, we will fix it tonight. I promise you that. Look. Hey. Who knows how to make you happy? -You do. -Come on. That's it. That's good. Okay. I have to go to the store. No, I'll go. I'll meet you at home. - Are you sure? - I got it. I love you. Okay. I love you too. Okay? -It's gonna be okay. -I know. -I'll see you at home. -All right. Okay. All right. So pizza's going off, catering's on fire. It's fricking Hiroshima behind me, man. Shia's running around like a mad man. I come out, not a scratch. Shia looks over. He is like, "Dude, you're so lucky, Steve." And then bam, it sticks. -Lucky Steve. -Lucky Steve. I like that. Man, 13 years doing pyro, not a scratch. Not a fucking scratch. I actually tried to get the name changed legally. Your parents must be so proud. - Hey. - Hey. - What's up guys? - Hey. - Hey. - Hey, Gill. Where's the satellite phone? - On the table. - Okay. Hey, how did they treat you? I'm having the best time. I told you you would. I take care of you. -Ditto. -Ditto. Are you teaching him movie quotes back there? It wasn't me. It was the one armed man. Now I'm gonna have Ghost and Fugitive quotes coming outta my ass. No more bad habits. - You're talking to me? - Oh, my God. I can't take you anywhere. All right, let's call it 15. All right. 15, guys. -Aye, aye, Captain. -About time. Twila, find me a mineral water and a Percocet dispensary. Holy shit! Is that Marla Taylor? Oh, hello... stranger. Looks like Mayor Schuzmarke from Orrstown and real estate developer Audra Rossi are gonna be formally meeting this-- Have you seen 'em out here much? Can't say I have, Dwayne. The more they stay away from me, the better. Do not be afraid, little flock. For our father has given us the keys to the kingdom. Bart will take care of it. -He always does. -Praise God. Praise God. Howdy. You think I'm some sort of Pennsyltucky redneck, son? I don't even know what that is. -Uh-- -Pennsa what? Hey, you guys have food or anything here? All we got's beefy wiener. Robert De Niro, I was in a film with him. - Maya-- - Danny Devito. It's Beth. Get Evan. And Alfred Hitchcock. I met Alfie at a party. I do not care if he's in a meeting. Get him. He is so grand to meet. - Fine. - I just adore him. Tell him he needs to call me back, we have to talk about this... Alex producer situation. It is untenable. Yes. Untenable is a word. It's a fucking word. Just tell him to call me back. - Dark or milk chocolate. - Dark chocolate. Mastercard. Y'all headed to war in that thing? That's what they say about making movies. They say it's like going to war. Y'all making movies out here? Oh, we are trying. You any good? We are terrible. That's why they sent us all the way out here. All right, Hicks, let's hit the road. It felt good dropping the kids off at the-- oh, didn't realize we had company. -It's okay. -Sheriff Buck, Wolf County. Oh, I'm Gillian. And this is Alex. And that's our crew. Movie folks. Oh, any good? They're terrible. Stop it. Yeah, we're just headed up to our location scout through Orrstown. Uh, we're headed to Wolf Hollow. The Hollow? Whereabouts? - The haunted hay ride. - Neuri's place? Yeah. Uh, Ray Neuri is my P.A. - Ray's in town. - Yeah. He's right outside if you wanted to say hi. Just might. Don't stay out there too long after dark. People get themselves in trouble real quick. That sounds awesome. It really doesn't. Well, we'll see you, Sheriff. Hey. You didn't tell me you were a local celebrity. - What? - Maybe lead with that next time. Hey, Ray. Hey, Hicks. No place like home, huh, Toto? I already took that one. Okay, Ray. All right. How about this one? Who is your daddy and what does he do? All right, move aside, Alex. Ray, let me give you a little insight at the worshiping at the altar of Arnold. Come on. Alex, get the hell outta here. Go! Thank you, darling. Bye. - All right. - Hey, Gill. - What's up? - I'll take over - from here. - Okay. There you go, Bart. Put your back into it. Maybe next time spring for the new tires, Mel. Huh? We ain't all made of money like you, Bart. Wish I was. Don't mind those Orrstown assholes. We know you'll make it right. What kind of man would I be if I didn't take care of my people, Mel? -No kind of man at all. -You can say that again. No kind of man at all. Walked into that one. Sure did, Bart. Give Evie my best, will you? Always. Parker's back. Had to give Mel a hand. You know his truck threw another tire. And you needed to fix it? - I fix everything. - I know. I married Norman Rockwell. Oh, you knew what you're married. Uh, yes I do. I did. And sometimes it pains me. I am so happy that you feel much calmer. I just needed to cool down. I'm good. Good. Give me that. I need to make a meringue. Oh. Meringue. How's the lever looking? Still sticking? What do you think? Let me know if you need a hand. We might have to sell for scrap. -How are we looking this month? -Fuck! See what you can salvage. On it. What the fuck! You're welcome, Bronx. First rule of Fight Club, schedules change. It can all change in a New York minute out here. Well, this is charming. Very scary. We are not here for the scare house, guys. We're here for the trail. You don't wanna see the scare house? So you spent your childhood around here, Ray? Some of it. Lot of regrets. Yes, woo, for Ray's haunted adolescence. It's like Norman Rockwell and Rob Zombie had a baby. But why are we here now? All right, Ray. Let your brother know we're here. Everybody else, put your hiking boots on. Now? Yes, now. Like now? As in now, now? As in we're doing the scout today now, now? But I'm not ready now, now. I have these-- these blemishes to address. - Twila-- - Marla, you look great. -Twila! -Yes, Marla. Coming, Marla. Ray? Hey, Bart. What are you doing here? Came back just to look around, if that's okay. Of course. Yeah, of course it is. This is Alex. She's my, uh, our producer on this. They're actually making a movie. Yeah. Uh, Alex Romero. Nice to meet you, Mr. Neuri. Please, just Bart. We were, uh, hoping to check out the location and maybe run an out if the schedules align. You're friends with Ray. Absolutely. -Especially friends with money. -It's the least I can do. What the fuck! -Ray? -Hey, Evie. Who are your fucking friends? Movie folks. Most of them from L.A. - Except for me. - Except Alex. -She's from New York. -From New York. I promised them a walk out to the point. Without a goddamn courtesy call? It's my property too. - It's Bart's! - It's okay. I don't mind. I can walk them out. Go finish up dinner. - Calm down. - I am calm. Okay? I'm fucking upset! -He came back. -Really? Why? And don't give me some fucking middle America nuclear family crap. Okay? I don't trust him. And who are these people? It doesn't matter. They got money. This is a godsend, Evie. Get them out of here. He came back. Oh, my God. Bart, why are you so naïve? He's just using you. He wouldn't do that. We take care of our own. It's his place too, you know. Oh, my God, I can't. What's the matter, Benj? The make-up department got you pushing too many pencils? If we were back in Jackson Heights, her ass would be on the ground by now. Tuck that New York away. Beth is looking for any reason to shitcan you and Ray. It's two miles. Let's go. Let's get the footage. Let's let Marla's face do its thing. Let Beth worry about her fucking career, and you take a stab at being our fearless leader. I don't need you falling apart. All right, let's go. Yeah, let's do this. How long has this all been here? About 40 years. My parents left it to us. Bart and I share the property, but he runs it mostly. -Benji-- -Look at this. It's a vintage scare house. I could sell half this shit on eBay and retire. Instead it's just sitting here, rotting away... like my nana's vagina. Can we go back down now? You really don't like it here? - No. - Why? Because scare houses are bull-- shit! You ready? Fuck off, Bronx. Let's go. Chicken shit. Beth's afraid of the scare house. Make sure you all stay close. Make sure you have plenty of water and stay hydrated. You guys got yourselves a real leader there. I have my moments. Is that why Ray likes you? I don't know. You'd have to ask him. Last Action Hero was so underrated, guys. Oh, up your ass. What? Jack Slater. That's like a Schwarzenegger's wet dream amped up to 11. Come on. Such a boy answer. So what's the movie? It's called Liberty's Last Stand. Working title. A World War II soldier is stranded and loses his eyesight. He's rescued by another male soldier who has to help him write letters back home-- She pictured it as Broke Back Mountain meets, uh, Saving Private Ryan. - That sounds awesome. - It really doesn't. So how'd you get mixed up with these folks, Ray? I was finishing up some film school at, uh, NYU last year. He had just moved there that year, right? Jesus! Oh, chicken shit. Oh, man, do you mind if I get some B-roll of this? Never even seen this. I don't remember building it. Yeah, Ray. What is that? Kids come out here and do stuff like that all the time. Can we move on? We are not using that. - Two seconds. Come on. - Gill, it's disgusting. Come on, everyone. Hey, you good? I'm great. The point's just over the next hill. Just be careful, everybody. It's about a 50-foot drop. Thanks, Ray. Everybody watch your step. What'd I tell you? This is perfect. Oh, this is gorgeous. I can't wait to blow this shit up. I'm not making a boy movie, Lucky. I'm making art. Art? Right, of course. Loud, explosive, sexy, gay art. Sorry, guys. Hey. Good call. All right, guys, let's get set up. Calm down, Bronx. I'm the director. All right, everyone, let's get set up. At least I know where you ran off to now. New York, of all places? It's a hell of a ways away. I needed it. Mom and Dad would be proud, you comin' back home like this. I'm not back, Bart. What? What the hell you talking about? I just figured you could all use the money. The rent from you, it-- it will help. You think I want money? You think I'm struggling out here? What? You trying to buy me off or something? After everything with Evie last year-- This has nothing to do with Evie last year. Calm down. I am calm. I'm just upset. So-- so what does all this mean? Are-- Are you going back? Back to New York instead of being here with your family where you belong? - Yeah. - You-- You're going back with these people? With Alex, yes. Give me a break. Give me a goddamn break. This, this is your home, Ray. Home is where I want it to be. Are you okay? Yeah. Hey, Marla, are you ready? Does the Percocet go well with my morning mimosa? Twila, help me up. Here I am. -You look great, Marla. -It's to be expected. Who is she exactly? A star, if you must know, Mr. Neuri. But for this daring piece of cinema, I shall be playing a nun. Who works in a small church. Marla, it's not a sexy nun. Well, just because she's a woman of God doesn't mean that she can't embrace her sexuality. Marla, we're losing light. Hit your mark. No need to be brisk. Is this where you want Lee eventually? Yeah. That looks good in that light. Those aren't practical, Marla. Well, if someone had remembered the apple box, I wouldn't have to resort to a shoe that elongates the calf. Oh, my darling. I am a woman of God, but you are my God too. -Yes, you are. -Oh, God, Marla, -you're making it weird. -You are my sweetheart. -You are my love. Take me to-- -Stop! I am committing. Shut up, Benji. Take me to heaven. Take me to heaven to be with you forever. Copy that. You see that? Oh, yeah. Yeah. That-- that's cool. That looks beautiful. Hey, Marla, that looks great, but can you back up a little bit? Go away. Hey, careful Marla. Shut up, Alex. Marla, we're losing light. Just, uh, give me some shoulder. I don't care if we're losing the light. It could always be worse. Marla. Kiss me you fool. -Marla! -Marla. Marla! Shit, shit, shit, shit. No, no, no, no! Oh, it's worse. Marla, are you okay? Marla? Marla, are you hurt? Someone help. Oh, my God! Someone get down here and help me now. Marla, it's okay. We're coming. Just don't move. How the fuck can I go anywhere right now? Why was she so close to the edge, Beth? I was looking at the monitor. -It's your fault-- -Hey, enough! Enough! Enough! -I'm sick of your-- -Hey! Hey! Enough! Hey! We gotta worry about getting her the fuck up. -All right, all right. -I'm so sorry. Oh, be my goddamn guest-- - Hey, she's right. - All right. So what if, um, okay, what if we rappel down there and then we walk her back up? It'd take about three hours extra on a downward slope. The best bet is to rappel down, Get her up and-- and walk her up. Alex, Alex. Hey. You're gonna need a hand. It's okay. All right, all right. Don't look. Don't look. - Hey, let's get the rope. - Come on. Come on! - Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. - Gill, Gill. - Here, Gill. Come on. - Thank you. - Come on. - All right. Ray. Your brother, Tim, Benji, all of you. Okay. We're gonna need some support on that line. - You sure? - Yeah, we gotta take care of our people, right? - Careful. - Um, Twila, get Evan on the phone. Um, or 911, whatever. Quit trying to save your own ass, Alex. Hey, shut up, Beth! Hey! Tim, you're in charge. I got you, guys. I got you, guys. You're a take charge kind of girl, huh? That's why I listen to her. Hey, get your asses over here and help out. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Grab it there. We're good. Hold it taut. Come on, guys. Hold on. Oh, Marla. Shit we gotta get you out of here. Don't touch me. Don't move me. Marla, it's gonna be dark soon. Then just leave me here to die. Oh, don't be so fucking dramatic. My feet are pointing in different directions you inexperienced film school twit. I have every reason to be dramatic! Okay. Hey, Marla. Marla, look at me. Look at me. Hey, I gotta set this and we're gonna have to splint it. -Okay? It's gonna be fine. -No, no! Not now, now. On the count of three, I need you to lift and we're going to-- Wait. Wait. I just-- Wait. I just remembered I have pills in my gown. -It will be okay. Okay? -No, no, please. All right. On the count of three, let's lift. One. Three! - Oh, God. - Okay. Okay. You skipped two, you fuckers! Did you get-- did you get it? Might wanna speed this up, folks. Marla. Hello, darling. All right. Uh, Marla, we're gonna have to do some walking, but they're gonna pull us up up there. All right? -All right. Here we go. -Okay. Yeah. We're feeling no pain, aren't we? Okay. Oh. All right. You got her so I can get the rope? - Yeah. - Woo. Tim, pack your stuff up. We need to move as soon as we get her up. - You sure? - Yeah. We got her. Jesus Christ, Marla. Oh, I'm okay. I climbed up all by myself. Oh, wait, how is everyone else doing? Is everybody okay? Twila? No, I'm freaked out. We need to move. We don't need to be out here much longer. Gear's ready. Let's go. Oh, we're not gonna stay for a rest? No time for love, Dr. Jones. Come on. Marla, you're gonna have to walk. Okay, Alex, I take direction very well. I am sure that you do. Okay. Come on, guys. We gotta go. -Alrighty. Woo. Let's go. -Here we go. -What was that? -Hey, whatever you do, don't move. Is that a bear? - Ray, remember the trail back? - long. Go, go, go, go. Come on, please. Hurry up. Go. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Beth, Beth, can you get the rifle? I've got Marla. - Beth, slow the fuck down. - Why? Beth, stop! We're trying not to startle whatever's out there. Beth, Lucky's right. Okay? Slow the fuck down. It can always be worse, right? It's worse. Hello, back. 13 years, guys. Not a scratch. Not gonna start tonight. Everybody stick together. Beth, stay the fuck put. Can't, have to go back. -Beth, don't! -Beth, get back here. I am-- I'll be in my trailer having sex with-- Marla? Marla? Oh, shit! Oh, shit! Marla, you're okay. You're okay. You're okay. What do I do? What do I do! Beth, what the fuck? Marla, it's okay. It's okay. I'm so sorry. Get it off of me! Beth, fucking get it! Help me! Help! Get it the fuck off me! Get it the fuck off me! Get it off! You gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on! Come on! Hey! Fetch! Fetch! Jesus Christ! Fucking thing got my arm. -Shh. -I'm scared. It's okay. You're okay. Look at me. Oh, my God.

Okay, I need a hand, please. You think you're fucking funny, Alex? Jesus! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's a poor choice of words. Okay, we gotta get him up. We gotta get him up. Okay. What? It's not starting! You shot Marla, Beth. I'm sorry, I-- You fucking shot Marla. You're not going anywhere. Tim, open the door. Lock the door. Lock the door. Touch my fucking husband and I'll put a bullet in you. Get in, get in, get in. Shut the door! Shut it! Shut it! Oh, what the fuck! What the fuck! Okay. It's gonna hurt. I hate you. Fuck! It's still bleeding. It's okay. It's okay. We're alive. You fucking bitch! You fucking killed Marla! You got her fucking shot! - Fuck you, Bronx. - Get the fuck off of me. You wanna go? This is my movie! You're not going to LA! We have way more important things to worry about than who accidentally shot who. It wasn't acciden-- You got Marla shot! You fucking murderer! Keep it chill, , Beth. You know what? Let's just let the cops decide what to do with you. -Who the fuck-- -I am in charge! I am in charge! Got it? Y'all okay in there? Bart? Bart, get in here.

Evie gets like this. She's a hothead. You showing up, Ray, Pissed her off more than I thought. Hold on. That-- That thing is Evie? Ray, get out here and we can get this all over with. - No, no. - Ray-- I'm not going anywhere with you. Don't start. Get out here. He is not going anywhere, Bart. You don't wanna challenge me, Alex. This is family business. Bart, nobody's going anywhere until we figure out what's going on. I am not losing any more of my people. You understand? Your people. Your people. You know nothing about having people. I said, stay the fuck outta this, Alex! You don't talk to her like that. Huff, all you want, Bart. I don't belong out there with you. They're my family now. Oh, I'll huff! And I'll puff! You stupid West Coast Hollywood bullshit assholes! They're not your family, Ray. We are! Give me my happy ending, you little fucking pigs! Ray, your brother's a fucking werewolf? Cool. Fuck! Mills, you almost there? Grab some toilet paper while you're out there. Anything else? - Extra coffee. - Aye, Aye, Captain. - Oh, you closing up? - Just about, Deputy. But you come on in. Get what you need. Thanks. It's Harp, right? Since I was a boy. You know, I told you, uh, we could take over this town if start running the show. That's all I need. Another shithole town for my personal sandbox. Give it to Sly. You know, I was thinking you'd be a good man to run things around here. No, no. We're almost outta here. Yeah, these dick shingles are wrapping up now and I'm on way back to the city. God, I fucking hate that prick. Damn right. I'm gonna party when I get back. Everyone just stay calm. I think it's just the fuses. I'll go take a look. Well, I guess it's time to wrap things up, folks. What the fuck? Well, shit, Mark. You heard that, right? Did you hear that? Thompson? Holy fuck. Sheriff, I'm coming up on your left. Sheriff, where the fuck is it, man? Marcus, don't move. Marcus! Jesus Christ. -Jesus Christ. -Jesus! There's a big fucking wolf in here. Call Mills. Tell her to get her ass back here right now. Mills, Mills, Come back. -This is Zhao. -This is Mills. I'm almost done, you jackass. We need you back here, there's-- There's like a-- a bear on the loose. Something loose in the station.

We've got an emergency back at the station. Harp? No one wants you here, you cops. And now these fucking film people! Wolf Hollow belongs to us. This is our goddamn fuckin' town and we ain't going anywhere. Buck? Buck, this is Harp. Buck? Buck, this is Harp. This is Buck, come back. We had a little incident down here at the gas station but it's all taken care of now. Another one to take out with the trash. Just a phone. I had a satphone in here. -It's okay. It's okay, Gill. -I had it. It's not your fault. It's not your fault. It's a werewolf. You might want to consider leading with that next time you try to make new friends. Hey, um, is any position you do it in -considered doggy style? -Enough. She's right. I'm the runt, I don't have it. Evie thinks I'm keeping her out. Should've cut me off a long time ago. I, uh-- got low about a year ago. I found a way that could change me. This silver dagger, something that could change a werewolf or kill one. So, I went out... built the wicker man, did the ritual, and... nothing. And I ran. Wound up in New York. And then I met my best friend. Ho-- hold on. You said something about the wicker man? Gillian. Gillian, get your camera. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. Turn it on. There. - There's the effigy. - Yeah. There's the dagger. All right. Level with me, Ray. Can we shoot our way out of this? It'll hurt him but it won't stop him. It's either the dagger or decapitation. All right. Well, if we can get the dagger, then we can at least stand our ground till dawn. -Okay. -I'll go. -Gillian. -Gill, I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna go with you. I'm the best with the rifle. - I'll back you up. - No, no, no. -I gotta do this. -Gill. It's okay, it's okay. It's gonna be okay. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. You're okay, it's all right. It's gonna be fine, you're gonna be fine. -Let's go. -Yeah, let's go. It's okay. You go, we go. Right? Phone. Phone, phone. Where is it? for the nine o'clock call. Oh, God. Evan? Hey, hello? Hello. -Oh, uh, hey, Beth, uh-- -No, it's Alex. Can you see me? Yeah, you didn't check in at the lodge. Evan, we're in serious trouble. Okay? Um-- Wait, trouble? I need to know, who's in there?

What good is it if the only person I saved turned out to be immortal? It just means I'm ready to kick ass tomorrow. Right after you grow some new arms. You never know. Gentlemen. Go ahead and load him up. I'm telling you, the biggest damn wolf you've ever seen. You okay, Alex? No. If nobody else saw it, I would have thought I was crazy. You are definitely not crazy. I just don't know how in the hell I'm gonna write up a seven-foot tall werewolf in my report. Come on, let's get you back to Orrstown. It's about the only town you can trust around here. All right, Sheriff, let's get the ambulance out of the way. Let's back it up. Once we reach Orrstown County, we'll reach out to the family and see what they knew. The rest of the family? Okay, Mel. Run this through again. I told you, Tom. I threw another tire. Lost control, damn near hit Wilson's prized goat, and flew off into the ditch. Can't you spring for the new tires next time? If I had a nickel for every time I heard that. You can afford new tires? Laugh it up, fuzz ball. You know, I don't want to share a room with that Lucky guy anymore. They brought him in. No arms. You can't trust a feller without arms. -You got that right. -Hey, Tom, mind leaving my patient alone for five seconds? -Taking a report here, doc. -It can wait. Never felt better, doc. Get me outta here. Shoot him, he's got hands! -Whoa! -No, no, you hold your fire. No shooting in the hospital. Whoa! She bit me. I am immortal. Oh, boy. What's up, cine-snobs. It's your boy, Crane, here on the Film Snob channel. As you know, we've been trying for the last few weeks to locate Lucky Steve. Hey, guys, it's Lucky Steve doing a live stream, yeah. Back again, that's right. If you're watching this, send help. We're in bad shape, guys. Now, I don't know if this is some promo, but honestly, it's got some of us in the film community a bit worried. Where are you? You used to be our favorite stream. We're trapped on Wolf Hollow. With some fucking goddamn werewolves. I'm not gonna lie. It's-- it's got your boy a little worried. Here's a few reactions. It's great stuff here. Marla's dead. And why haven't you guys gotten back to my agent about the role? Bro. That looks like more than a couple of scratches. - Wait, did somebody say-- - Werewolf? Dude, stick to the action. Your makeup looks as fake as fuck. Don't make me come down to Apollo because I will find you, and I will kill you. What are we saying here? The pyromaniac finally blows his arm off. Oh, fuck you. Oh, okay, look. Whoever said that, I'm gonna fucking hunt you down like a goddamn beast and ri-- rip your arms off. Okay. "How did the werewolf eat Lucky Steve's arm? He wolfed it down." Oh, fuck you, man. You know that's-- That's bullshit, all right? You be in here right now and try to fucking deal with these things. See here. "This guy is a fucking weirdo." Fuck you. I'm not weird. I'm fucking-- I'm immortal. Fuck you, man. I don't think I could die, actually. Think of the amount of stunts I can do. I'm a fucking immortal, guys.
