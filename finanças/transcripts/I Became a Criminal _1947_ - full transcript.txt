On one side officer if you please. Let's have a little respect here. Thank you officer. This way. The late Mister Dabcock I presume. Debcock, Elfred George. 21 Poplar Street . He was playing croquet yesterday; not a care in the world. "Sic transit gloria mundi". Cor, stone a suffering duck. Ruddy near torn my arm out sir. Weighs a bloomin' ton! Not 'alf it don't. Hiya, Jim. Been stealing cigarettes again? whadda ya want It's Soapy n me, n Bert n Curley. Run into any trouble? -No. Let's have a decko at the body in the bag. Ok with you Curley? Ok by me, mate. Aggie, meet me at the bath at the st sancerre Curley bring it down to Lamberth. ...tonight at the usual time. Consider it done. Keep out a couple of hundred for me will you? My boyfriend smokes like a chimney. By the by, you boys are getting a new playmate. Who is he? A bloke out of the RAF. He's found life a bit tame since he's been demobbed.. Name of Morgan. Morgan.. What's his speciality? He's got class - we need a bit of that in our business. Not that I ain't got it myself but he was born into it. I'm seeing him later tonight, if we agree on terms... I'm bringing him back tomorrow. Have you checked out his credentials? Ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer. You're the boss. Nice of you to say so. Limpy's on the phone. He wants to talk to you about some New Zealand mutton. I say, Soapy, keep me a leg of it ... ...if there's one thing my boyfriend likes, it's mutton. Dressed as lamb. I hope you never spoke to your mother like that. Oh I never had one. Come, you must be the son of a... something. Look here Narcy - this Morgan, I suppose he's an amateur? We all gotta begin sometime don't we? Sounds like trouble to me. I'm ashamed of you, Bert, standing in the way of a job for an ex-service man. Sometimes I wonder what England is coming to... Well hello look who's here. How's my handsome boy tonight? -Can't complain, Ducky. Clem Morgan here? Morgan? Morgan? Oh yes the RAF type... ..over at the bar there with the priority blonde. Narcissus dear, can you sell me a case of scotch? I'm temporarily out of scotch. Can't get the labels printed owing to paper shortage. I'll pay you 5 pounds a bottle for the genuine stuff and 3 for the floor varnish . That's a very good price. -Not half it ain't. Sorry I can't oblige. What are you drinking? We're disguising ourselves heavily as scotch. At least the trade name is scotch. Ellen, meet Narcy. Narcy, Ellen. Hello, Narcy. Pleased to make your acquaintance, I'm sure. Pull up a stool old boy. Sit down before you fall down. Same again here, a double gin for me. Well how you been keeping, Clem? Sober. That's the ticket. Did you meet my popsie? Ellen, Narcy. Ellen is a very sympathetic type. Without Ellen no birds would sing. Sounds like he's 7,000 ft up in the air, doesn't it? Oh he's just feeling sorry for himself. Sorry? Bored. BORED. If it weren't for Ellen I'd be liable to do myself a mischief. Too much energy that's your trouble Clem; too much animal spirits. What you needs an outlet. -What he needs is another war. Is it my fault if I've got too set in my habit? Fill em up again, all 'round. Oh not for me, thank you. -Oh c'mon! We're all friends together I hope. Fill em up! Fill em up, my friend will pay in Japanese yen. He's a bloke after me own heart. You n me oughtta get along like a house on fire, Clem. This is the kind gentleman I was telling you about. He's offered me a job. What kind? Oh what you might call 'free enterprise'. Indeed you might. InDEED you might. Well? Well what? -Is it a deal? Tell you what I'll do I'll toss you for it. Gimme a double headed penny. All I got is an ordinary one . San fairy ann. Heads its a deal, tails no soap. -Fair enough. What's yours? -Tails. Tails it is! -Tails it is. Okey Dokey its a deal. Here's to it. To Narcissus and Morgan, the poor man's Fortnam and Mason. Here come the boys, Cora. Whatcha you gonna do? Borrow another couple of bits from Soapy? No, I don't need any money anymore. I just wanna remind him that I'm still alive. Ooh - you picked a funny place to do it. Well? And what did the old cow die of this time? -Nylons. Well keep out a couple pair for me will you? My boyfriend likes me in them. I was beginning to forget what you looked like. What are you doing here? I told you not to bother me during office hours. Are you coming around to the pub tonight? -Maybe. Hop it now, will you? Forward, please. That's it... There she goes... Welcome home boys. -Hello, Narcy. Hola, Clem, have a nice trip? No bones broken. -That's the ticket. How do I look To the manner born. Hello, Clem. What are you doing here? Waiting for you of course, you big silly. I was worried about you. Sure! We was talking about the good books you been reading lately. That's a very cultured fiance you have in Ellen, Clem. I'm all for a bit of culture. Is it nailed down? No just press button A. Everything here? Don't look like much. 700 nylons Limpy said. Can't trust Limpy further than you can see him with your eyes shut. What are you looking for? -Bed bugs. Everything's there. -Who said it wasn't? Ahh there's the stuff that builds bonny babies, me boy! There's more mazuma in that there parcel ... Than you'll see in a month of foggy fridays. What is it? -Sherbet. No coupons. Since when have you been handling that stuff? Whats the matter with you? I never agreed to mettle with that muck. This is just a special job for a friend. Are there gonna be anymore? I wouldn't say yes and I wouldn't say no . Well you better make up your mind. -Hey come off it. Anyone would think this was a peace conference. I don't think I know what you mean by that, Clem. If there's any minds to be made up around here they ain't gonna be mine. I ain't an amateur mucking about for the fun of it. I built up this business from nothing and I'm the boss. If I wanna peddle sherbet I'll peddle Sherbet even if it hurts your finer feelings. Fair enough? Or do you think we're not respectable enough to suit you... Now that you really look at us. If you're handling that stuff I'm not playing. Do you want me to give you back your ring or may I keep it among my souvenirs? Now, now.. knock it boys. This is no time for back-chat. You've got to be on the job again in half an hour. Narcy ain't gonna run this stuff at the city line, Clem. He's just passing it through for Limpy, same as Limpy does favors for us. You just ruffled his feathers a bit. Now c'mon, kiss and make up. And let's go and have a drink. Well you've got my name down Narcy. If you're peddling that tanglefoot I'm packing up. You're not though are you Narcy? -No. But I don't like being criticized. I've got a very sensitive nature y'know.. You wouldn't think it but I have. Aggie, tell Limpy we won't do any more special favors for him.. On account of it gives Clem heartburn. Consider it done. Sorry I snapped your head off Clem no offense meant, none taken I hope. Soapy, tell Curley the stuffs here and to pick it up right away. You blokes come with me and I'll give you the set up for tonight . Only one watchman and he's half deaf.. that's right itn't it, Bert? That's right. It'll be as easy as taking jujube's from a blind baby. About the only thing we haven't done. We're on our knees. Whadda ya mean? We're slumming. This is as good a racket as any other these days. That's what I thought but I've stopped thinking it. You've never seen me this way have you? What way? Stone cold sober. Just because you and Narcy had a bit of a flare-up? It's not that. I'm pulling out of this business. You can't do that now.. -Why not? You know too much You're darn right I know too much. Don't be a fool, Clem. I've always been a fool. I might be a crook, but not that sort of crook. What are you going to do about tonight? I'll go through with the job because I said I would. After that they can kiss you and me goodbye. Fair enough. Unless it'll break your heart to tear yourself away from Narcy.. Don't be silly. Just so we understand each other... That's all baby. Don't do anything hasty will you, Clem. What's your opinion of Clem, Soapy? Oh he ain't doing too bad for an amateur. Bit stuck up over one or two things.. but he'll get over it. No he's got a nasty nature, Clem has. Turn on you soon as look at ya. Jealous too I'll be bound. I never did like jealousy. Very Neu-rotic type, Clem is. You ain't got your eye on his girl, have ya? Who, me? What a nasty mind you have sometimes, Soapy. I've got me own girl, ain't I. Sally is good enough for me I should hope. It's just I don't like amateurs. I gave the watchman one for his nob. Clem is getting the stuff ready inside. That's the landing -Ok shove off then see you back at the shop. Good luck. What you send him home for? -Oh I got my reasons. You in good shape tonight Soapy? -Well I hope so I ... You and me may have to do a bit of quick sprinting. Draw up by the landing. What's up Narcy? Oh nothing just that I got a pre-sentiment. You know me, the deep type. Coulda made a fortune reading tea cups. All clear? All clear. You can stop we're coming right up. Get in. Hit him. -What? Hit him. No you won't. Give us a hand. Check up on this Bern Who is it? 61 Archer, sir. Is he badly hurt? He's had it, sir. There's a new one. What's he in for? -Manslaughter. He killed a cop. Thats not manslaughter. It's fumigation. What's the stretch? -15 years. Oh my aching back. Right! Morgan, you're wanted. Morgan, you got a family? -No. You sure? -Yes. That's odd. Your sister's here to see you. Sister? Tell her to hop it. Better tell her yourself. You got 15 minutes. -C'mon, Morgan. Miss Morgan? Hello, Clem. Who the hell are you? Narcy's girlfriend. Sally Connor. -Then you know what you can do. I bet you say that to all the girls. Whatta ya want here? Oh I was just passing by; thought I'd drop in. Has your girlfriend been to see you since you moved in here? Who wants to know? I do. She hasn't, has she. You don't have to try and save face I know darn well she hasn't. Anyone'd think you were minding your own business. Alright, sit down. I am minding my own business. Or I wouldn't be keeping you from a Turkish bath, believe you me. What's Ellen got to do with you? Only that she and Narcy are waltzing in a dream. What makes you think I give a damn. Look, Clem, I don't know you from Adam... ..I never met you before. If you're girlfriend had kept her finger out of my pie... I wouldn't need to know you now. I'm a chorus girl. I know how to take care of myself which is more than you did. You have to take my word for it that I'm on the level. I bet you are - like Narcy was! Don't be stupid all your life. I know you were framed. Cora told me. I didn't notice her giving evidence at my trial. Soapy sends his regards by the way. He's not looking so well these days. Something he ate? I thought you might like to know his conscience is troubling him. What's the game? Whatta you want? I might be able to persuade Soapy to turn King's evidence. He hasn't got the guts of a flea, he'd do it. And why should you take such a deep personal interest in my welfare? I wanted to see the kind of chap Narcy double crossed... ...before I decided which way to jump. I'd like to help you. I believe you; thousands wouldn't. Since I wasn't on the level what do you think I'm doing here? You came down in a bad pit of jealousy to make as much trouble as you knew how. You'd be the first to yell your head off if anything happened to your precious Narcy. I'm through with Narcy. Listen Mata Hari: I'll square up with Narcy in my own time. Tell him the next time that he wants to send someone snooping around here to pick someone who can do it better. Go on go home. Well if that's the way you feel about it.. better ring for you butler, have me shown out. That'd be the first time you weren't thrown out. Bye. Good bye. Time's up. What if tomorrow brings nothing but sorrow? Who cares? I love you. Caress meeee Sally did you see Cora she's looking for you. Oh perfect Johnny, thank you. Cora's got a nerve, coming back here. I asked her to. Hello, Cora. Hello Sally. What did you want to talk to me about? Something private. I want your help. I may need quite a lot of it. You were the only one who was kind to me when they fired me from here.. I'll never forget you for that, ever. I went to visit Clem Morgan on Sunday. What for? I wanted to see the kind of man Narcy framed. That's crazy. I want to help get him out. -No. Yes, you and Soapy. If Soapy turns King's evidence, there'd be nothing they could do about it. What are you talking about Sally? Narcy watches him every minute. Ever since the trial - he'd kill him. You don't know Narcy - you never did! You don't have to tell me about Narcy I want you to bring Soapy 'round to my flat one night this week. He wouldn't come. He would for you. I can't. I can't ask him to do a thing like that, Sally. Not even for you. It isn't fair to ask me. Alright. Where do I find him? He comes around to Joe's sometimes when I'm singing there. But he can't help you - I can tell you that now. I still prefer to ask him for myself. But Narcy... -Narcy? I'm not frightened of Narcy like you and Soapy are. He wouldn't dare try anything on me. Oh wouldn't he - for Pete's sake you haven't hung with him alone, Sally. You don't know when you're well off. Good night Sally -Good night. Next time you cut in on my top note I'll bite your nose off right in front of all those people out there. Alright, alright. Take it up with Sam He's wearing the lipstick, not me. I just come in when he gives me the cue. Why hello, Narcy. Olga - Sally still here? -I suppose so. Had a change of heart? -Maybe. Sally still in there? Well, if it isn't Superman. Whip it quick to you. Where were you on Sunday? Whadda you care. Did you go to see Clem Morgan? Where is he playing this week? What did you tell him? I don't know what you're talking about. You told him I was going with his girl, didn't you. You don't mean that great big beautiful doll whose mother was frightened by a duck? Take your hands off me. I gotta teach you to keep your talk to yourself Sally. It's gonna hurt me more than it does you but its for your own good see. You try knocking me about in here they'll send for the police -Let em! Always the perfect little gentleman. That was just to get me handy. Poor kid. Oh take it easy Ducks, I'll go and get help. Bill, Bill! Give us a hand quick. Go and get a taxi - we gotta get Sally home. Narcy's just beaten her up. Why the big lug I'll go and get a taxi right away. Bill's going to get us a taxi. We'll soon get you home. Are you too badly hurt to walk? Oh don't worry Ducks - we'll look after you. Here we are honey you made it in great style. Go and turn on the bath Bill, I'll fix the bed. -OK. No man ever beat me up before. I warned you about getting in too deep. I never did understand Narcy. He's bad, he's really bad. Bath's running. Can you make coffee Bill? -Like a dream. It's in a tin marked 'curry powder' on the top shelf. Make it strong. And shut the door. You'll steer clear of Narcy from now on won't you Sally. He's not even a respectable crook. Just cheap, rotten, after-the-war trash. Can you use that nightie or shall I get you a new one? There's one in the drawer. Top drawer. I've been such a fool Cora. We all make a mistake or two We wouldn't be human if we didn't. But promise me you'll steer clear of that gang from now on. Clem Morgan included. You're not very tough. Not tough enough to take care of yourself in a pinch like I am. You're not really tough at all. You just try to be. Just because you thought it'd be the smart thing to do. Promise me? I never want to see any of them again as long as I live. That's the ticket. Here we are - a nice strong coffee and a sort of sandwich made by Bill. I think he should take first bite in case it chokes him. It's good for you C'mon, try to drink a little even if you don't really want it. There. Right! Who's gone. Morgan. Lord Brittania... George Clement Morgan. Repeat, George Clement Morgan. Age: 27. Height: 5 foot 10 and a half. I still need all the police you can spare. Brown hair, grey eyes. Repeat. Brown hair, grey eyes. Serving 15 years for manslaughter. George Clement Morgan. Repeat, George Clement Morgan. We got those bloodhounds on the job! Age: 27. Height: 5 foot 10 and a half. Repeat. Age 27 Stop! Or I'll fire. Mr Keaney, the farmer, insists he hit Mr Morgan when he fired at him. and it is now considered possible that the escaped man, though still at large is suffering from severe wounds. It is now 24 hours since Morgan escaped from a road party working near the prison. Police cordons have been combing the neighboring country ... and detailed warnings are being circulated among the more outlying districts. Morgan, a black marketeer Your turn. -Йwas serving a 15 year term for manslaughter. Mr Carter, when questioned by a number of his constituents replied, that he had been... Getting himself shot! I always said he was a bad amateur. George Clement Morgan. Repeat, George Clement Morgan. Age 27. Height: 5 foot 10 1/2. Repeat. Age 27 Height: 5 foot 10 1/2 brown hair... Are you alone? No. Who else? Only my husband. Where is he? Asleep I think. Do you know who I am? Yes. Are you afraid of me? No. I want clothes. You're wounded aren't you -No I'm not. They said on the wireless thatЙ -Nevermind! Й what they said. I can let you have some clothes. You'll want some food too, won't you. I wouldn't turn up my nose at it. I think there's enough hot water for a bath. You'd need that most of all, I should think. I'd prefer not to be arrested in that all together, if its all the same to you. Nobody'll arrest you while you are in this house. I give you my word. Why? You've fallen in love with my beautiful wavy hair? No. But you can do me a service in return for helping you. Me? Do you a serviceЙ Come with me I'll show you the bathroom. You can use my husband's shaving things. You sure he won't mind? No, he won't mind. It's this way. You mind if I go first? It's your privilege. Through that door. Put those things outside for me to burn. I'll leave you some fresh clothes on that chair. Don't make a dash for the telephone. We haven't got a telephone. You'll find a fresh towel on the rack in there. It's a very good fit, considering. You don't hear me complaining, do you. I'll make you up a parcel of food to take with you when you go. I hope this is enough meanwhile. It's alright, it's only my husband. Damn. Hello. Sorry my dear, I didn't know you had company. Just forget you saw me. Just forget. Is he always like that? Yes he's always like that. Bad luck. What were you in prison for? For something I didn't do. You killed someone didn't you. The law says I did. You were a gangster. Madam the only reason I am fat headed damn fool and not a hero Йis because I went on doing what the country put me in a uniform to do... Йafter they'd taken me back. What were you in? RAF. Did you see much action? I was a P.O.W. for 2 years in Germany. I escaped. When you escaped Йdid you have to kill anybody? Too right I did. But I didn't kill that copper. Who did? What do you care? -I do care. A black marketeer called Narcy killed him as far as I can remember. Narcy? -Short for Narcissus. But you did kill a man when you escaped from GermanyЙ -mm hmmm How did you kill him? With a beer bottle. -A beer bottle? It's alright, it was empty. Can you use a gun? Maybe. Pick up that handkerchief. Would that be of any use to you? Good for fending off mosquitos. You can have it. On one condition. What's that? I want you to shoot my husband. Are you around the bend? I'm in deadly earnest. Well if he bothers you so much why don't you shoot him yourself? Because they'd hang me. You want jam on it, don't you. One more murder can't make much difference to you you're a hunted man anyway. We're quibbling on a technical point -What? I'm not a murderer. Then you won't do it? What do you take me for? Thanks for the clothes and the food and the shampoo. I'll do the same for you sometime. You coward, you coward! You'll want to get rid of one or two of those motherly ideas of yours. They'll land you in the kind of soup I'm in. Thanks again and good night. Mrs Fenshaw has been removed to a hospital in a state of collapse. She was able however to give a complete description... of the clothes stolen by Morgan after the murder of her husband. He is wearing a check tweed coat ...grey trousers, cream shirt ...striped tie. a belted raincoat Bad company you used to keep before you met me eh?. This is the fifth day that Morgan has been at large. The police in the Exeter area have been warned... ...that he might be making his way in that direction. What do we do if he gets to London? Get to London who? Clem? Ha Don't make me laugh. Whatch you been doing, listening to Soapy? Clem'll get about as far as I could throw a dead elephant with one arm tied behind me back. I knew he'd get out I knew we hadn't seen the last of him. I told you he'd get out somehow. Well that's no skin off your nose. Oh ain't it. He's after me alright. Don't you fret its me he's after. He thinks its me wot framed him... I only done what Narcy told me to doЙ Narcy told me to hit that copper! Oh shut your gob you never know whose listening in this police circus. Narcy slugged him over the head, not me. I was only sitting behind the wheel. I couldn't do anything else could I? Narcy would have slugged me too. Cripes can't you keep your ruddy voice down? Why don't you shove your head out of the window and yell it all over the street and have done with it. But he's after me, Cora. But he hasn't got you yet has he? -No. But he will get me. Well if you're so scared witless why don't you go to Narcy and get him to hide you? Narcy.. Narcy don't want me about now that Clem's out on the loose. I'm the only witness that Clem didn't smack that copper. I tell you they want to kill me Cora. Both of em! That's what it is, they want to kill me! Kill me! -They won't dare. Oh yes they will. I don't got a dog's chance. Yes you have. I won't let them find you. Don't worry Soapy. They won't get you as long as I'm looking after you. You're going to disappear for awhile. That's what you're going to do. Don't worry. We'll fool 'em. Don't worry. Don't worry! Will they hang him? -Will they not! Can I have a look at that paper please? -Sure. Come along, you'll be late to your own funeral. Reading any good to you? -Suit me fine. You a harker? -No. Good. They give me a pain in the arse. Pinched more damn spanners. Where you making for? Manchester. You're a long way from home aren't cha? I've been on holiday. You've been traveling light don't cha? Had my room burgled. Lost the whole shooting match. People have got terrible designs since the war. I don't know what the country is coming to. I'll be driving all night. That's fine, I don't mind. I get me beauty sleep in the daytime. Wanna buy some petrol coupons? Sorry, I'm broke. I don't sell em in the ordinary way, you understand. Lots of people are crooked these days. But I have no taste for crime. What part of Manchester are you from? Do you know Manchester? I've been there once or twice. I come from Bank street. I had a chum the name of Freddy Willmont, do you know him? He comes from Manchester. It's quite a place, you know. Did you hear about that convict that got loose? Yeah. Makes you think, doesn't it. Yeah. He's killed a bloke since he got out. Who said? Chap was telling me at the depot. Wouldn't half be a laugh if he turned out to be you, wouldn't it. Thanks for the compliment. How would you feel if it turned out to be me? You never know who's up to what these days. They used to call it St Lukes Street didn't they? What? Bank street. I thought you didn't know Manchester. No, but I go there, in my dreams. What are you getting at. I heard this convict got a load of buckshot in his back. Too bad. Your identity card wasn't stolen when you lost your kit was it? Why? The coppers are liable to stop us in any town and ask for identification. My identification is ok. How's yours? Never better. Then there's nothing to worry about is there. Not a thing in the cock-eyed world. Kind of uncomfortable these darn things, aren't they. They're alright. Why don't you lean back and take it easy? We got a long way to go. Did you say something? No. My mistake. Maybe you'd better lean forward. Why? Give your back a rest. Are you trying to make out I'm that convict? Are you trying to make out you ain't? May I see your log sheet, your driving license and your identity card please. Right-o. Thank you. On your way. Sure you won't change your mind Sally? Look that spaghetti can stand one more warm up before we pension it off No, I wanted to go home. Thanks all the same. I've got a headache. Ok you pop along home and get a good night's sleep. See you tomorrow -Bye bye -Good night honey -Good night Sally Sweet dreams. -Same to you. Have a light? No. Here's your change Miss Connor. -Thank you. Here they come. I've got some cigarettes for you come Wednesday dear. Thank you darling. Late night final! Good night dear. Yeah. The escaped convict is in London He broke through police cordons by over powering a lorry driver and stealing his lorry and identification papers. The lorry driver was discovered by police, tied and gagged in a wood near Exeter. He is reported to be only superficially hurt... and is suffering from shock. Go away. Get out of here! -Where's Soapy hiding? How should I know. I don't run around with your crowd anymore. I don't want anything to do with any of you. Get out of here, quick! Get away from that door. I'll call for help. You try! I don't know anything about Soapy or Narcy. I don't have anything to do with them anymore. When did you see Narcy last? -The day after I came to see you. What did he say? He beat me up. Too bad. I can't help you. Will you please get out of here. This is the first place Narcy will look. Suits me fine. I never wanted to get mixed up with people like you. I didn't know what I was letting myself in for. Will you please get out of here and leave me alone! Where's Soapy? -I don't know. Where's Soapy? -I don't know, I swear I don't! Where's his girlfriend Cora? -I don't know! Ripe for your age, aren't you. I thought you were the girl that could look after yourself. I can. I believe you. Thousands wouldn't. What'd you want to escape for? You know they'll catch you. Too bad if you've got cold feet all of a sudden. You should have thought of that before you came to the jail and started something you couldn't finish. I didn't think you'd be fool enough to do it. -No? Well now you're learning something about human nature. When a bloke gets put away for 15 years he doesn't curl up with a good book. He gets bitter. He gets a pain in his guts! He wants to lay his hands on the double crossing swine who put him in. Next time you want to play with fire use a matchbox instead. This time you're gonna finish what you started. Or we're both going down together. You can't drag me into it. I won't! I won't be dragged into it! You're a murderer! You kill people! -Not since they put em out of season. You killed that man in that house you broke into -I never killed anybody. The old woman tried to talk me into it and then did it herself after I'd gone. For the last time, are you going to get out of here? I don't care what you do to me. I'll scream until somebody comes. You kick up more fuss than a drunk pack mule. I'm hungry. I've got a back full of lead shot. The whole damn world and his dog are after my skin. The least you can do is offer me a drink and a cigarette. If I give you one, will you go? Yidda yammer yidda yammer Stop haggling and get me a drink. Who is it? It's me, Mrs Perry. I've got your rent book here. Push it under the door will you? My hands are all soapy. I'll get the plumber to look at your sink. First thing next week. Couldn't get him any sooner. Thank you Mrs Perry. Why didn't you yell for help? Afraid I'd kill you? No. I didn't kill that bloke, you know. Doesn't make much odds anyway, does it. The only man I ever killed was a sentry with swastikas up to his eyebrows. Happy New Year. What are you going to do about that lead shot in your back? Sell it for what it'll fetch. It'll poison you won't it. Not soon enough to suit you. You better let me see what I can do about it. When you've had a few more? If they're not too deep in I can try to get them out. What with, a ferret? If they're like splinters I could get them out with eyebrow tweezers. Had much practice lately? Has anyone ever told you you have a very funny sense of humor? No. Good. I think I have some iodine. At that moment her husband comes in. Uh oh here comes chatterbox and now it'll be all over town. How do you want me? Served up with a lemon in your mouth. What was that man's wife like? Which man? The one you said you didn't kill. Her. Mad as a hatter. Was she young? I forgot to count her teeth. I thought you didn't fall for that story. Who said I did? How do they look? Not so good. Hold tight. Alright? Yep. That the lot? No. Whats up? I don't feel so good. Squeamish huh? Better take a shot of the whisky I'm alright. She loves me. She loves me not, She loves me. Where's Soapy? Can't find him. What the blazes have you been up to all this time then? Well he must got out of London. -Don't give me that bilge! He ain't got the guts to go out of London. Where's Cora? -She's lying low too. You've tried all the dumps she hangs out at? Well she's not likely to be lolling around in a pub when you've been asked to go and pick her up. Why not? She's gotta eat, ain't she? She's gotta pay the rent if she's hiding Soapy. She'll be out seen somewhere if you're smart enough to keep your eyes skinned. I can't be at half a dozen places at once. There's nothing like having a damn good try. Get out of here and don't come back till you find em. Savvy? Take Shawney with you. And I ain't gonna be too choosy about whether Soapy's still warm or cold, if you follow me. Just so long as we find him before Clem does. Get cracking! Both of you! Gimme your dusters Eddie. Max! -Whose that for? It ain't safe for Sally to be alone in that flat with an escaped convict around. My coat. Jim, you're coming with me. Just for the ride. -Sure. Watch out you don't over do it Narcy. The cops'll be around like hornets 'round a jam jar. I ain't gonna lay a finger on her. Nor on Clem either. If it so happens I come across him... ...Jim wasn't a ballet dancer for nothing. You find him, we'll bury him. 851.5 Ace of spades, ace of spades, where's that bloody ace of spades.. Well, that's the lot. Hey - you can't go to sleep here. Clem. You poor chump. Please wake up, you can't go to sleep here. Nag, nag, nag. Pick, pick, pick. Yitta yamma, yitta yamma. Thanks for mending my punctures. Are you going to go now? It would break your heart to lose me, wouldn't it. I'm sorry I don't know where Soapy is. Cora would know. That means trying every pub in a mile in road. They'll recognize you won't they? I'll wear my hat back to front. I would have helped you if I could. We've got a lot in common my poppet. We both tried to play with dynamite. And we're both rank amateurs. I'll leave you a piece of the rope in my will. You can wear it in your locket - to remember me by. Do you have any money? -No. I can let you have 10 bob. I'm not proud. Thanks. Sorry I haven't a gun. I wouldn't need one. I think you will. Only one way of killing a pig. When I first saw you I sized you up as a flutterbrain cluck. You've turned out different. I wish I had met you when I was still at Sunday school. Maybe I'd have turned out different too. Well, this is no time to cry over spilled milk. I must beat it. You're a fool to go out looking for Soapy. Why don't you lie low until you get your bearings. Is that a bohemian suggestion? No, I just don't like watching a fellow walk straight into the barrel of a shotgun. You say the prettiest things. So long sister Sally. Take my love for the bed socks. Blast. What's the matter? -The alley's full of cops. I have to go out the front door like a gentleman. But they'll be out there too won't they? Complete with a brass band and a dressed welcome. Wait - they know those clothes by now. I know they do; so what? There's a man with clothes in here. Man? Narcy left it here once. There's no time to be choosy. Don't forget to wipe your boots. Well, Well. If it isn't Narcissus in person. Well, well if it isn't inspector Rockliffe. What frolicking whim brings you to these quarters? Must be animal magnetism. What are you doing here? Waiting for a taxi? No, I come every year to take the waters. I see you brought Frankenstein with you. Yeah, he's working his way through college. Is Sally at home? I don't know, I was too shy to knock. Like me to do it for you? Might be more fitting coming from you. Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. You sure you don't mean rat? Not unless you smell one. I've got a cold, I can't even smell you. Guess I'll call back later. I say, how's the undertaking business these days? Booming. I wish I could interest you in one of our new models. Utility? From you, we wouldn't ask dockets. I'll bear it in mind. And don't forget to tell your friends. Since when did a detective have friends? Ask a silly question and you'll get a silly answer. So long, Rocky. -Hasta maссana. How's Soapy by the way? He's never looked back since he's joined the Oxford group. Remember me to him, if you run across him. I'll be glad to. Remember me to Morgan, will ya? If I see him first. Miss Sally Connor? -Yes. Good evening I'm detective inspector Rockliffe. You want to see me? -If I may. Won't you come in. -Thank you. Where is he? He left about half an hour ago. No he didn't. Which way did he go. Through the kitchen window. Walters! Hello, sir. Anyone been through? No, sir. You've been here all the time? Never moved sir. Alright. Is he still here? No. You're quite a girl, aren't you. You better come along with me. Have you a warrant? I'm not arresting you. I'm trying to stop Narcy from slitting that pretty little throat of yours from ear to ear. You've stuck it out just a couple of inches too far. Hello! Found your matches yet? No, but I'm lonely. -Who ain't? Where do you live? -Just around the corner. Like to ask me up for a cup of tea? You bring your own sugar? -You're sweet enough as it is. Charming - you make me feel 21 again. Of course I love you sweetheart, Hilda Thompson never meant a thing. What's gone on with you? I don't know, you must have gone to my head. Affectionate, aren't you? I had a spanish mother. Hey! Narcy. That dirty son of a... Urgent message from Lambert station sir. They picked up a man answering Morgan's description. They want you to go there and identify him right away. Alex you'll have to take Miss Connor to the station. Ask the station manager to look after her, understand? Yes sir. Tell the yard to send another car to pick him up. Evening, Cora. Evening Jerry where's Tiny? -Over by the piano. Tiny. Oh it's you again is it? Now what's the matter. Tiny I gotta speak with you -Well wait till I ain't busy. No I can't wait I must talk to you now. I oughtn't to stay here anyhow -You're telling ME you oughtn't to. I've lent you all the money you're going to get out of me. Tiny just once more I swear I'll never ask you again. I'll pay it all back. I just gotta pay my room or they'll chuck me all out! How much -30 bob. Run away. Out of the way! Hey what's the big idea? -Take it up with Narcy later. Hey you didn't see nothing - not in my pub you didn't. I couldn't agree more. It's truth! -Where's Cora? Ain't they nabbed you yet? -Where's Cora? Never comes here no more -Where can I find her. Try cock-eyed Mamie's -I have she's not there. I don't know where she'd be then. Perhaps Fidgety Phil might know, he was here just now. Where'd he go? -I reckon you'll find him at Tiny's. Thanks. Evening Sargent. Have you traced the car? Evening sir, no, sir. Anything happen at the Valhalla? No, sir, we kept the place watched all night but its deserted. That so, Murray? -Yes sir, nobody's been near it. What are you doing here, Fidgety Phil? Brought him along in case we want to question him, sir. He says Narcy's cleared out of the Valhalla and moved to a new hideout. Where? It'll take a couple of days to find out sir. Any idea of where it might be? No sir. None of the boys know yet. But he has cleared out of the Valhalla. Oh yes, sir, Narcy digged that you digger about the VAlhalla so he won't use it anymore. Where's Soapy? I don't know, he's been hiding from Narcy for quite a while. Ever since he heard Morgan was out -Yeah. Would Morgan know Narcy's new hideout? I couldn't say. It isn't likely. Do you know that Morgan's been combing the pubs trying to find Cora? Has he? I don't think he'll find her. Why? Narcy's boys picked her up at Tiny's tonight. When? -Quarter of an hour ago. Narcy framed Morgan didn't he? -So they say. And Soapy's the only witness. -There's a rumor to that effect. But it'd be indelicate of me to discuss it further. Ok, Phil. Here's a little present for you, sir. Thanks. Do you think we can get a warrant issued to search the Valhalla anyway sir? How the heck can I get a warrant at this time of night? We're shutting the stable door after the horses hopped it. So you ain't set eyes on Soapy for a week. No I haven't. And that's the gospel truth, Narcy. I swear it. Nobody's calling you a liar, are they?. Nobody'd be so unchivalrous. He came to see me about a week ago. He said he was thinking of signing on as a steward in one of those weekend boats. He always was one for the sea. I guess that's whats made him wet behind the ears. Jim. -Yeah? Lets have a look at that belt you was telling us about. Glad to. Jim's been telling me about this here belt of his. What a card he is. Life of every party at Lambert. Whattaya call it Jim? My coaxer. Jim's coaxer. Like a purseman's noxy. We ask a question and you gotta guess the answer We only ask simple questions, don't we Jim? It wouldn't be fair otherwise. Nobody'd win a prize. I haven't seen him since a week ago. Te lo dirнa si le hubiera visto. Don't. Don't beat me up. I can't stand it Narcy, I can't stand it. Please don't beat me up. -Leave her alone, Narcy. Sally! Tell him I don't know where Soapy is! Of course she doesn't know where he is. He wouldn't be fool enough to tell her, knowing you. Oh Sally! Please don't let him beat me up! C.mon! Where's Soapy? Alright, Jim, let her have it. -Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Bring her up! I'll tell, I'll tell. He's in the Hotel Nelson. What room. 19. Soapy... ...forgive me. Go and get him. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Pre-war? Just because I'm a vagabond a vagabond I'm always willing to be I hold the title, and stick to it with pride Whatsa matter? There's a chap looking for Fidgety Phil. Who are you? Is Fidgety Phil here? Who wants to know -I do. I'm trying to find Cora. Phil don't come here no more. Pop it. I want to see Cora. Where is she? Take it up with Narcy. Looking for someone, Morgan? My name ain't Morgan. Let's take a little walk, shall we? And don't try to get rough. I learned just as many parlor tricks during the war as you did, you know. Murray, get to the nearest phone and report we picked up Morgan. and get em to send a car right away. -Yes sir. Attention all cars . Cancel message number 43. Morgan arrested. Repeat, Morgan arrested. Units detailed to search for Morgan... can return to normal duties. Repeat: Units detailed to search for Morgan... can return to normal duties. Cancel message number 43. Morgan arrested. Good ol' Scotland Yard. They always get their man. The wrong one. Hey Narcy, I can get that last truckload of junk out of Valhalla to Lambert now they've called in the police cars. No, it's too risky. It's no riskier than leaving it in the Valhalla. The cops will find it anytime now. Its the last load of Whisky -THE Whisky! And once that's out of the way our noses are clean. Theoretically speaking. Is Limpy expecting you in Lambert? I told him we might be leaving the Valhalla at 2 o'clock sharp. Ok, go ahead. Keep a couple bottles for me.. You know you are getting downright dishonest. It's the company I keep. You can tell a girl wot boozes by the company she chooses. And the beat got up and slowly walked away. Make yourself at home. You weren't too bright coming to London. You might a known Narcy'd have a new beau by this time. Where is he? If I knew I'd have him right beside you by now. How'd you come to get mixed up with cheap scum like Narcy? You had a fine war record. Thanks for the compliment. I've been keeping a close check on your friend Mrs Fenshaw. Some of her testimony seems a little too slick to be true. You astound me, Holmes. Just thought you might be interested. You know that two of Narcy's boys picked up Cora tonight? She'll tip them off as to where Soapy is hiding. My guess is that by now Soapy's had it. Hurrah for the boys in blue. It's gonna take us a day or two to find Narcy's new hideout. Why hurry all that much? Take your time. There's only one way we could find it sooner -A ouija board? By using you as bait. The best that could be said for it is it would save the government the price of a rope. It's wicked what they charge for ropes these days. Yes. What I want is two ropes for the price of one. Go on, run for it. All clear sir. Good. Is that you, Cora? Whose there? Murder, murder! Help! Murder, murder! Help! I've always been your pal! I won't say anything honest I won't. I'm your pal Jim. I wish some of you boys would wipe the jam off your fingers before you handle these cards. I only bought this pack yesterday and you could use them for fly paper. Aw the lady's flapjabbing. Getting a little pernickety in your old age. Well I haven't stooped to blowing my nose on my shirt tails. I'm mentioning no names but watch where my eyes rest. Who dealt this book? -I did. Then you dealt twice running. He didn't. You dealt. How do you know? You were too busy making thumbnail marks on the ace of spades. Trying to make us honest? -You? Why you'd sell your own mother to a arse-meat butcher. Jim. Where's our wandering boy tonight? He's gone for a swim. He always was the athletic type, Soapy was. "Come on in" he says to me. "The water's fine". "What me?" I says - "with my bronchitis?" "I'd catch me death". What have I done? Soapy. I've killed him. I've killed him! It's me! I've killed him! Why don't you kill me too? I have nothing to live for now! Kill me! Shut your trap. There's a draft. What are you going to do with her -Nothing. She can't do us no harm. Only go squealing to the first cop she sees -Who'd believe her? To all cars. Morgan broke arrest. Repeat: Morgan broke arrest. Last seen heading towards West End. Repeat: Last seen heading towards West End. All cars in Lime House area to withdraw and concentrate on routes to West End... He's left a bit late if it was Soapy he wanted. That puts the cops on the track again. Who cares? Curley will be on his way to Lambert any minute now. He won't run into em. What's the time now? Quarter to two. -Nae, your fast its twenty to. PLenty of time to stop him. Got a gun Jim? No, I use me toothpick. Got a gun Bert? You know I don't use a gun. It would ruin my reputation. What are you using guns for? The police ain't gonna be the only ones we run into if we stick our noses outta here. Morgan will be heading to the Valhalla looking for me. Got a gun Eddie? No, thanks. -Whatcha mean "no thanks"? I never did a job with a gun and I don't intend to start now. Don't be so reactionary. This is the century of the common man. Take it. -No. Take it or I'll shove it down your throat! I'll take it. It don't mean I have to use it. You'll use it. Max, my coat. This is the last time Morgan runs his fingers through my permanent wave. Here, you... you better come along too. Why? I gotta feeling we're gonna run into your dream boy. And there's nothing I like better than playing cupid. Sentimental type. The Lovers' friend. Leave Evian with me -Shut up! Even in our line of business there's such a thing as over-doing it. But you've over-done it Narcy. It'll come home to roost. I've never been so deadly serious in my life... it'll come home to roost. I'm just warning you, that's all. Now go ahead. If you want to. You're breaking my heart. Apres vous. What do I do? -Stay put. This dump gives me the horrors. That you, Eddie? It's me, Narcy. Anything been happening around here? No, silent as the grave. No one tryin' to get in? -Nope. That joy ride is off. The cops are looking for Morgan. Suits me. You any good at dirty fighting? -I've done a bit in my time. Take her into the office. If she tries to get funny bash her face in. Alright. He won't be barmy enough to come here. That kind of barmy he would be. Well we want to finish him right by ourselves -Why? Well it makes a nice kind of rat trap. We'll come out with no teeth missing. Jim. -Yeah? Climb into that chocolate box. Who, me? You heard. Blimey. Whatcha doing? trying it for size? Can you breathe? -I guess so. How long I gotta stuff in here? Til Morgan makes his farewell appearance. Bert. -Yeah? You're off in that one -I see. Like an Arabian Nights pantomime. You might tell 'em to leave me a paper and a bottle of milk in the morning. Who's there? Arthur -Arthur who? Arthurmometer. You've been listening to the Third Program. Any sign of Morgan? What's the hurry? Gotta catch a train? All set. All we needs a doormat with 'welcome' on it. I don't want no twittering out of you when your little playmate arrives. Or Curley'll have to conk you one on your pretty coconut. Just you keep your trap shut. Open that door. Morgan... If you're carrying a gun... ...take a good look at what you'll shoot! You better come out and talk things over, Morgan. That's not the way I play. Grab his gun. Clem! Clem he's got the gun! Get him Curley he's got Bert's gun! Are you alright? -Yes. Where's Morgan? -On the roof. They're fighting on the roof; quick. -Get him down. Where are the rest? -In there. What have you been playing at? Kiss In The Rain? Ok, scrape 'em up. Tell the inspector. It's Narcy, he's dying. Alright. Detective Sargent Murray says its Narcy alright sir and he's dying. I'm coming. You've almost too subtle Morgan. Nice work, just the same. Alright. Narcy's dying. If there's anything you want to say to him you better make it snappy. Did you call the ambulance? -They'll be here any minute. Sorry, Narcy. You and your ruddy milk bottle. Narcy, I didn't kill that copper did I? Narcy, it WAS Soapy, wasn't it? Was it Soapy? Never heard of him. What do you mean? Clem killed that copper. Those are my dying words. Narcy, please... please tell them the truth! It wasn't Clem. Tell them it wasn't Clem! Narcy, I beg of you. You do, do ya? Well that's... different. In that case... I hope you both rot in... Curley's gonna show us where the rest of the gang are hiding sir. Alright, shove 'em in that car. Jim, tell them Soapy killed that policeman. He knows, that's why Soapy was going to turn King's evidence. Jim tell them! You won't get much change out of him. See you at the mortuary sir -I'll be there soon as I can. Bert, you're different from the others... You said you didn't like cheap crooks, you know Soapy did it. Tell them, tell them! Fat chance they'd believe me. It's all right Miss Connor. We'll get all the facts before we're through. C'mon Morgan. -Ok. Thanks for trying. Thanks for everything. He hasn't killed anyone! You can't lock him up again! He hasn't killed anyone! You've wasted your time. You must forget about me, Sally. It'll be easier than you think. I won't forget you. Let's not get Soapy. By the way, here's your ten bob. Sorry I didn't have time to autograph it for you. So long. I'll wait for you, Clem. That's what I was afraid of. If we get any fresh evidence you can always submit your case to the ? How many forms will you have to fill up? Or can't you tell me? Millions.
