[bright ambient music] [somber music] [waves lapping] [notification chimes] - [Actress] Go downstairs now, Mortimer. - [Actor] She's right. You have to go downstairs now, just for a little while until we get back. [gentle music] [water pattering] [woman moaning] - [Session Host] I just want to close by reiterating something that Ben said earlier. Remember that our current and future plans, expectations and intentions, results, performance, our goals or achievements are made up of forward-looking statements. These kind of statements are founded on estimates and assumptions by management, and are of such a state that we feel comfortable sharing them with those of you on the call now.

If you are prefacing any of what was shared with these words or other words, let the clients know that, and that our projections are just that, projections. That's all we have here. Are there any questions or concerns? What about you, Ryan? You'll likely see clients before anyone else? - No, you covered it all. Nothing to add. - [Session Host] Okay, then moving on. [microwave whirring] With the new CEO coming into her first year, the scope of certain things is going to change. One of the items that will be scrutinized more closely are expenses. If you'll proceed to slide three we've prepared some tables showing real versus expected expense ratios. Expense ratios as you know are the value of- [faucet hissing] [Ryan whistling] - [sighs] Fuck sakes. Like, the worst fucking gift from my mom for Christmas. - Really? What did ya get? - [Ryan] Ya know, like, she got me like this fuckin' home sign. - What do you mean home sign? - Like, home. Like, the word. Ya know, like live, laugh, love shit? - Oh, yep. - Yeah, that. Then, like, I had to break it to her the next day. I was like, I'm not gonna fuckin' use this. It was horrible. - Sorry, Mom. - Yeah. [Kara giggles] [water trickling] [soft guitar music] You wanna go to McDonald's? - I got a Skype with Laura. I'm good after. - Where is she now? - India still, I think? It's all right, she'll come back. - You gonna visit her? - [chuckles] No. [ball thudding] [shoes squeaking] - It's not, it seems like it's not. - [Man] Leavin' today, kid. - What are you doin'? Come on! - Come on, Michael! [men chattering] - Jay, Jay! Jay's playin' like a fuckin' pussy, man. Can't let him post you up like that. Come on! Fuck. Fuck! Playin' like a fuckin' fag. Come on, don't let him back you down! Jesus, fuck. Come on, guys! [player groans] [ball thudding] Yo, Brad, my bad, man. I forgot. - Don't worry about it. - Ya sure? - Yeah. [party goers chattering] - Yeah. [party goers chattering] [upbeat music] Hey. Can I smoke this in here? - Nah, but you can smoke out back if you want. Though, if I show you where, you have to split it with me. - I guess you can come. As long as you promise not to talk. - Why would I wanna talk to you? - Good. [party goers chattering] - When are we gonna stop talking? - Right now. - Now? [party goers chattering] - So, did you play in school? - No, as you've seen, I'm not very good. - You're fine. - See. - No, like, you're good. - It's okay. So, how do you know Pat again? - He played basketball with my brother at UNB. - Right. - Mm-hmm. - So, he knew I played, but I never, like, visited them at school or anything. - So you never met before? - No, I played women's league since I moved here. Pick-up is actually a nice change. - You move here for work? - No, I go to U of O. - Really? - Yeah. - What do you study? - I'm in fashion. My last year. - I can tell. - That I'm in fashion or that I'm in my last year? - Both. - Both? - What do you wanna do when you finish? - I don't know. - That's good. - Yeah? What do you do? - I am in in outside sales for a large evil company that shall not be named. - Mm, so you love it. - It's my life's passion. - [chuckles] I can tell. Do you want any more? - No. - So, what'd do you take in school? - Comparative literature. - Is that useful for your job? - No. [chuckles] So, are you guys goin' out tonight? - Yeah, you're not gonna come? - I might. - Well, goin' somewhere close, I think, probably Clinton's. - Clinton's. - What? - All right, I think I'm gonna grab a shower. - That's a good idea. - What are you saying? - Nothing. - Uh-huh. [Maya chuckles] - Hey. - [Man] Hey, how are you? - Good. - I was just thinkin', like- - A witch! - Imagine, like, you piss off your neighbor or your neighbor's son is bullied by your son and he gets home and he's like, "I'm pretty sure Mrs. Fawcett is a witch." "What!" - I heard Brad got into a fight with his boyfriend at your party. - Who told you that? - It's not gossip if it's true. - Brad said somethin' he shouldn't have. - He already apologized. - Yeah, you can't say sorry for everything. Why didn't you come? - I was on a date. - With a guy? - Technically, yes. - Sounds like it turned out well. - Ry, this guy, he came to the date in winter boots and a backwards hat. - Where'd you meet him, Super Burger? [Paul laughs] - I wish. - Did he have on white sunglasses? - No, luckily it was at night, but you know what he did have? - Um, a son? - Nope. - A glass eye. - No. - A puka shell necklace. - No, stop. - No, let me guess again, let me get it. - A peg leg. Okay, we'll stop. - He had a thumb ring. [Paul and Ryan groan] - That's so much worse. - No one actually wears those. - I swear to God. I swear to God. - So where'd you meet him? - Fucking Tom. I was out with him and Ashley at a party last week and they would not shut up about this guy. So I finally gave up and told them to give him my number. - Gross. - It was terrible. - So, when are you going out again? - Now, get this. So, he messaged me last night, on Sunday, and he says, "Come to my hotel room." [chuckles] - What? Why does he have a hotel room? - I don't know, something for work, I guess. - Well, did it work? - I mean, maybe if he would have made some kinda effort I would have. Fuckin' ask me out for a drink, and then maybe after a couple ask me to go to your hotel room. - People are just lazy. - It was crazy. - Just kill it. [gentle orchestral music] - [Paul] Hey, is Brad's boyfriend gonna be here? - [Ryan] He moved in, so I assume so. - [Paul] What was his name? - [Ryan] Sam. - [Paul] What's his deal? - I don't know. I've literally never spoken to him. [knuckles tapping] - What is this? - It's you. - That's me? - The last date story you told me. - [Vanda] That's a compliment. - Exactly. [chuckles] Hey, come in, come in. - Hey, how's it goin'? - [Brad] Can I get you guys anything? - Hey, man. - [Brad] Hey, how are ya? - We brought snacks. - Thanks. Can I get you a drink? - Hi, boys. - [Ryan] I'd love a beer. Hello, Vanda. - Hello. - [Brad] Paul, beer? - [Paul] Yeah! - [Ryan] Sorry, did we make it in time? Paul wanted to walk. - [Brad] Yeah, still a few minutes. - [Paul] You survived. - [Ryan] Sweet. [sighs] - [Vanda] You guys walked here? It's freezing. - Found that out. - Hey, sorry, guys. - Hey man, how's it goin'? - Ya know, it's just an honor to be invited. - Kinda hard not to if you're gonna be staying here. - Staying here? I think most people would say living here. Such an only child. - Come on, it's about to start. - Hey, I just wanted to apologize if we caused a scene at your place the other night. - No, no, don't worry about it. - Okay, I just don't want it to be, like, a thing. - It's not. I don't think anyone took it as anything. - Okay, good. - [Ryan] Hey, what's up? - [Vanda] Hi. - You move your phone or I have to sit on it? Can I have some of those? - We have too many pillows, Brad, really. - Let's take it off. - When'd you get here? - Thanks. - Been here for awhile, waiting for you guys. That's the truth. [Ryan laughs] So, yeah. - Talk to Paul. - [Mika] We need a quote today, Ryan, okay? It is completely unacceptable that it is taking you so long to get back to us. You knew that we were opening these new stores this quarter. You've known for months. Today, Ryan. Today. Ryan? Hello? - You're not my only customer, Mika. - [Mika] What? - I have other projects. That's why it's taking me so long to get back to you. - [Mika] Well, for the rest of the day, let's pretend we're your only customer. - Okay. - [Mika] Okay? - Yeah, just in the car. Let me get home, I'll have something for you. - [Mika] Hotspot on your fucking phone, Ryan. I don't care, okay. We have a planning meeting tomorrow afternoon. I need these today so I can at least review them in the morning. - [Ryan] Okay. - [Mika] We'll have something today? - By end of business. - [Mika] Call me when you have them. - [Ryan] Will do. [disconnection tone beeping] [Ryan grumbles] - Would you be friends with me if I voted conservative? - Hypothetically? - There's not an election on, so sure. - Okay, well, are you still a practicing homosexual? - I plan to be, at least hypothetically. - Doesn't that sort of preclude you from voting conservative, then? - What are they gonna do if they win? Put me in prison? - Does your vote get them a majority? - Sure. I put them over the top. - Prison for sure to celebrate. - But you'd still be friends with me? - They put you in that nice jail by the lake, I'll come visit for sure. - That's nice of you. - Let's go back a sec. Why are you thinking about voting conservative? - Everyone at work's super right wing. - Sounds lovely. - Used to not say anything, then I started pretending to agree. Now I just might agree. - Do you actually vote? - Yeah, usually. - Wild. - You're still coming to Sam's birthday party, right? - When's that? - Friday. I emailed you about it. - Yeah, I got it. - So you'll be there? - I don't know, probably. - His friends are shit. You have to come. - All right, whatever. - So you'll be there? - Yeah. - Fuck, I wish you could still smoke inside. - Didn't realize you were here. - Oh, I feel like shit. - Did you go out last night? - No, called in sick to work this morning. - Nice. - What are you up to today? - Nothin'. [Ryan coughs] - You goin' to that birthday party for Sam tonight? - No, I think Shelly might come by later. - Oh shit. - Yep. What about you, you gonna go? - I told Brad I would. He's worried no one will show. - Then what does it matter if you go or not? - Maybe I'll see if Vanda wants to go. - She went to her parents last night. - Right. What's the point of this game? - You just kinda walk around. That's pretty much it. [Ryan coughs] [Ryan groans] Where you goin'? - That fuckin' party. - Why? - I don't want Brad to get all pissy. [water pattering] [upbeat music] [guests chattering] [Ryan coughs] [upbeat music] [guests chattering] - Hey, thanks for comin'. - Hey, man, no problem. Happy birthday. Where's Brad? - He actually had to go out for work yesterday. - Oh really, on your birthday? - Well, luckily my actual birthday was Tuesday. - Oh. - Of course it was his idea to have a party. - Nice of him. - Yeah. I just feel like your last birthday should be your 30th. After that you're really reachin'. - Kinda feel like 12 should be your last, but I hear what you're saying. - Yeah, totally. Like, who's excited for their birthday at this point? - I don't know. - I wish none of these people were here right now. Sorry. - No. It's okay, don't worry about it. I told Brad I'd be here which is kinda why I'm here. I actually called in sick to work today. Knew Brad'd pissed if I bailed. - Really? - Sorry. - Are you contagious? - No, no, I don't think so. Spent the whole day wallowing on the couch, though, so who knows? [chuckles] - Don't feel like you need to stay. I know you came here to see Brad. - No, it's all right. I'm doin' all right. I'll stay. - If you're sure. But yeah, you definitely don't wanna be on the other end of one of Brad's micro grudges. I only agreed to this to avoid one myself. - So wait, why are we here? - [chuckles] At least you don't have to pretend. You can just have your shitty time and go home. I have to endure to the bitter end. - From what I can tell, you're doing a lot of fake smiling. - It's not all fake. But mostly, yes. Especially around Brad's friends. - You guys goin' out tonight? - Yeah, we're goin' to Somewhere Nice. Do ya know it? - Mm-mm. - They do a drag show there on Fridays. It's fun, but I think it's mostly for the straights. So they can pretend to see what it's like on the other side of aisle, or under the dress or whatever. - Sounds like a good time. - It'll be fine. We just don't have a lotta gay friends, so it's kinda awkward to pick a place for everybody. It will be fine, but I don't know. - Well, if it helps, I think I'm gonna pass on the drag show. One less person making it weird for you. - Afraid? - Of what? - To come. - No, I really do feel like hell. - Mm-hmm. - I'm not even drinking. - Uh-huh. - Plus you're the only person here that I know. Once we got there I doubt you'd have much time to babysit. - Well, ya never know. - Thanks, but I think I'll be one less straight for you to be mad at. - I'm not mad at you. - I don't know, you seem pretty mad. I mean, I get it. We literally ruin everything and make things lame. - Mm, that's true. You guys are the worst. - How do you think I feel? [Sam chuckles] - You should come? Despite my moaning, it will be fun. More fun than this. - I'll stay until you go, but only if you don't ditch me. - Deal. But I can't promise you won't have to talk to someone besides me. - I can handle that. [guests chattering] [music thumping] [water pattering] How was last night? - Bad. - Why bad? Couldn't get it up? - She was on her period. - Classic excuse. That or they haven't shaved. - How was your party? - Very lame. What are you doin' today? - I got a call, Laura at 11. - What time is it there? - [chuckles] Fuck, I don't know, nine? - Jesus. - I gotta go to the library right after that. - Yeah? - Gotta finish this fuckin' paper by Monday. Later. - See ya. - He's like- - My gosh. - He can't play sports anymore. - That's brutal. - Because of rugby and football. He's, like, a little guy, but, like, he's got- - Hi, I'm Ryan, I don't think we've met before. - Hi. - You think I wanted to go to Ottawa for the weekend? - Where were you? - It was my mom's birthday. - It's always your mom's birthday. - You managed to survive somehow. - Yeah, just barely. - That's true. You almost got gobbled up. - No Paul? - He's got a paper due tomorrow. [dramatic music] [swords clanking] [players chattering] - [Player 1] Shoot that. - [Player 2] He's open! [Paul groans] - Add one. [player laughing] [guests chattering] - Maya? You showering? - What are you saying? - I'm saying you definitely need to shower. - Oh right, of course, because of all the basketball. - Well just, like, generally, too. What I'm saying is you should shower more? - Is it that obvious? - It's apparent. - Damn, why didn't anyone tell me? - Probably because they're scared of you. - Right, because I'm so intimidating. - Well, it's because you're so fashionable, like right now. - Don't even. - What do they call this? Wichita street style? - Wichita? - Yeah, like in Kansas. I assume it's this fashionable there. - Ya know, I was gonna ask you for your number later, but now I don't think I will. - Again with the intimidation. - Well, I was already warned that maybe I shouldn't. - Is that right? - Mm-hmm. - What did this warner have to say? - The usual, although I think they were mostly trying to get at me themselves. - Who was it? - Paul. - That makes sense. - But then I asked about him, and he apparently has a girlfriend? Is that true? - [sighs] Like, at least in his head. - Think I could jump in there? - Yeah, sorry, dude. Maya's just about to go in. - Oh, yeah. - Sorry, I'll be quick. - Yeah sure, go ahead. - Just jump in after here. - Yeah, no worries. - There are towels in there. - Thanks. - Ask me later. - Ask you what? [music thumping] [guests chattering] [phone buzzing] Hello? - [Sam] Hey. - Sorry, who is this? - [Sam] It's Sam. - Sam. Oh. Are you calling me from a payphone? - [Sam] Yeah. - Is everything all right? - [Sam] Yeah, everything's fine. - [Ryan] So, why are you calling me from a payphone? - [Sam] Ya know, Brad is a consultant for the phone company. I worry that he's tracking me. - Sounds a bit paranoid. - [Sam] Yeah, maybe. - So what's up? - [Sam] What are you doin' right now? - [Ryan] Working, technically. - [Sam] Any chance you wanna take a break? I'm right by your place. - Yeah, sure. So, are you from here originally? - [Sam] I usually just say yes, but I'd be lying. I'm from the suburbs - [Ryan] Aren't we all? - [Sam] Yeah, I don't think anybody's actually born here. - [Ryan] Anyone who is is smart enough to leave. - [Sam] Not your first choice? - [Ryan] I guess it was at some point. I feel like the garbage strike was the closest Toronto ever got to being itself. - [Sam] Oh yeah? - [Ryan] I don't know. It's like Toronto spends so much time pretending to be things it isn't. During the garbage strike it couldn't pretend. - [Sam] Been workin' on that theory for awhile? Sometimes I think I'd like to live in a small town. - [Ryan] Yeah? - [Sam] Like, I have friends who live on a farm. They seem happy. - [Ryan] But? - [Sam] But then I actually go and visit them. - [Ryan] Completely different world. - [Sam] Definitely not one I fit in. - Right. So, can I ask? Why did you call me from a payphone? - Oh, it's dumb really. - Probably, but why does that matter? - Fine, it's just, ya know, Brad took computer science and works for phone companies. I just worry sometimes that he might be spying on me. - You really think he'd do that? - No, not really. It's just, he gets so jealous and he's away all the time. I call people mostly. I don't text other guys. - Even friends? - I never liked texting anyway, so whatever. I'm sure if I was single, I would, but I just don't wanna raise any suspicions. - You have a history of raising suspicions? - No more than anyone else. - Can't remember the last time when someone called me on a payphone, or the last time I used one. I only answered 'cause I thought it was an emergency. - Well it's lucky for me you did. - Sorry, I'm not sure I know what you do. - I'm a photographer. - Really? - Let me finish. I'm a photographer for the city. - City? - Municipality, yeah. - You take pictures of what, buildings? - If I'm lucky. Parks or beaches on a good day, subways and compliance photos on a bad day. - And today? - I took photos of a scrapyard this morning. - Good? - Better than I'd hoped. - This afternoon? - Tonight, streetcars. One after another, after another. [suspenseful music] [diners chattering] - [Ryan] It wasn't a date. - But you went out, just the two of you. - Yeah. - How? I don't understand. - He just called me. - Out of nowhere. - Yeah! - Went out. - Yes. - That's weird. - Why? I go out with just you. - Yeah, but we're friends. - We weren't always. - And we didn't go out when we weren't. Don't you think this is weird? - Sam seems like a nice guy. - So you guys are gonna go out again? - I don't think so. - But maybe. - No, we'll probably never go out again. Throw him off. - Like, what did you guys even talk about? - Why do you care so much? - It's just so weird. He isn't our friend. - Yeah he is. - No, he's Brad's boyfriend. He's like, okay, he's like our friend, yeah, but he isn't our friend. His number isn't even in my phone. Is it in your phone? - What? - Sam's phone number, is it in your phone? - No. - See? - I don't like adding people's numbers. - It's just, we have enough friends already. I mean, you know what I mean? Who wants to make new friends? - Wait, are you single? - Like, are you gonna start inviting him to stuff? - Well, I wasn't going to, but it seems like you really want me to. - It's just so weird. - Him and Brad are coming with us to this zoo. Are you gonna to be able to contain yourself? - Brad's our friend, so yeah. - Oh, as long as it makes sense to you. - I just don't get how you don't see this as weird. - Can't two people have coffee? - No. - Comin' tonight to the party? - I have an early class tomorrow. - Are you, like, 20? - I'm a very old 21. Ancient. Basically 22. Hey, weren't you supposed to call me? - I think you were supposed to call me. - Oh, is that how it works? - I mean, I clearly don't know. Why don't you tell me? - You really don't know? - I guess not. - Okay, so you call me, ask me to dinner. I tell you I'll think about it, and then you call back again, desperate. Then I give in. - Then what? We have dinner? - Maybe. - Seems like a lotta work. - Yeah, definitely. But it's totally worth it. - You're sure? - You aren't? - How about this? You just come to my house for dinner. - You can cook? Guess we'll find out. - [Maya] Wednesday. - Finally. - [Ryan] What's up? - Brad isn't coming. - Why? - He's going away for work tonight and he says he needs to pack. - [Vanda] What a skeeve. - What time's his flight? - Late. I don't know when exactly. - [Vanda] Well, what did he even do last night? - Nothing. - Why didn't he pack then? - I can't say. - [Vanda] Fuckin' rat. - Just tell him to come, we aren't gonna be back late. - He won't change his mind. He'll spend all day packing. - I don't understand. - [Vanda] So let's just go, then. - I thought this whole thing was his idea, though. - You're still gonna come, right? - I mean, I don't want to impose. - No, no, come on, come on. - [Vanda] Okay, I'm gonna call him. - [Paul] Train's leavin'. - [Vanda] People are just obsessed. - [Ryan] Like, I don't get it. Who cares? - [Vanda] It's just like, grab a handful of underwear, toss it in a bag. Jeans, shirts, whatever. - [Ryan] It should take less than 10 minutes. - [Paul] Five minutes. - [Ryan] Sorry, 10 if you wanna dress nicely. - [Vanda] Like who who's he even seeing this week? Sam? - What? Sorry. - Who's Brad seeing this week? - He's going to Oakland. - Oh. - Mostly anyway. He's meeting people from some startup. - See? They'll probably all be wearing cutoff jean shorts and he'll have spent a day picking out a tie. - [Ryan] It's crazy! - Totally! Like, no one cares how you dress anymore unless you're an I-banker and then- - [Ryan] And then you have other problems. - Thank you. It's just like, why? Why would you rather be in a closet than with your friends? - Because it's tough to dress for the Bay Area. - I just think it's crazy. ♪ In the land of cotton ♪ Old times there are not forgotten ♪ ♪ Look away, look away ♪ Look away, Dixieland ♪ Look away, Dixieland [gentle music] [birds squawking] [gentle music continues] - [Sam] You guys still comin' over Sunday? ♪ Guess you put the money [indistinct] ♪ - [Computerized Voice] Next message. - [Glen] Hi, Ryan, Glen Byers calling.

It's just that, ya know, it's important to know where we both stand in what we're thinking before the meeting.

They had this, like, hundred-foot water slide at my summer camp. - [Ryan] Oh really? - [Maya] Yeah, I was like going down it and I remember it was, like, so intense. And I remember that I went down it and then I was swimming back to the dock to, like, where my friends were. And I was like, "Oh, that was so fun!" Everyone was looking at me like, "Oh my God, what's going on?" I like push myself up onto the edge of the dock. And my nose was just, 'cause like the slide was like so fast that my nose was just like bleeding like all over my face. - [Ryan] Oh really? - [Maya] Yeah. As I was swimming up, I was like, "Oh my God, what's going on?" - [Ryan] You just had no idea. - [Maya] Yeah. No, I didn't feel it 'cause I was just like wet and I was, like, swimming or whatever so I didn't notice and then I was just like covered in blood and they were all, like, horrified. - Oh my gosh. So, how is the fashioning of things going? - It's good. Just in my last year, trying to get it all done, ya know? - You've made it this far, everyone just wants to see you make it out properly. - Yeah, we're doing, like, an end of the year show, whatever, show, yeah. It's in like a month or two, so that should be good. - What are you showing? - I made a small photo-zene about fashion in Finland. - Finland has fashion? - It does, yeah. It's cool. It's kind of its own little thing. It's not European, but not totally Nordic. It's interesting. - So, what, is it almost done? - I have the original laid out, but I'm just getting a bunch printed and then I have to pick colors. - Should it be blue and white like their flag? - Yeah, maybe. - I'd like to see it. - It's in my studio at school, but I can bring it home for you to see. - Yeah. - So do you have any wisdom to share with someone graduating school? [bright rock music] - It's not good. - I'm impressionable. - All right. [sighs] I would say, remember that traveling doesn't make you interesting. - What do you mean? - Okay, so like, a lot of people think that if you travel then you're automatically interesting. You aren't. - So you think people shouldn't travel? - No, for sure travel. Everyone should. What I mean is like a lotta people think, ya know, went to Thailand, lotta photos on a beach, look at me now, now I'm interesting. - Sorry, I don't really understand what you mean. - Sorry, I'm not explaining myself well. I mean, care about real things. Do real things. Traveling is cool, but not, like, it just disappears. If that's all you care about, then you're just a person with nothing to care about. - So, just care about things? - Sure, I just think that there are a lot of things that should happen on the margins of your life that wind up being what people lean on. - Okay. - It's, like, pictures on a phone aren't interesting. I just think, like, if you remember that then you're gonna be happy. - 'Cause you're happy? - Exactly. [bright rock music continues] [door squeaks] - [Actress] Do you understand? [phone buzzing] One to five years, that is. - [Actor] That's a long joke. [phone buzzing] - [Actress] It's a record. I did three months before I came to trial. - Hello? - [Sam] Hey. - I think I know who this is. - [Sam] Oh yeah? - Dad? - [Sam] Guess again. - [Actress] "Where'd you get the fur coat, Toni?" the judge asked me. - [Sam] Hey, what are you doin' today? - [Actress] "Met a guy," I told him. He said he was in love with me and he gave me the coat - Um. I mean, my computer's open, so I guess I'm working. - [Actress] I say, "But it's true." - [Sam] Well, I got assigned a job today that isn't terrible. - [Actress] "Where's the man?" he asked. - Doing what? - [Actress] "I don't know," I say. - [Sam] They need me to go down and take some photos on the Leslie Spit. - Yeah? - Yeah. You should come with me. - When? [gentle twangy guitar music] - Do you wanna come back to mine? Grab, like, a cup of coffee or some tea or somethin'? It's just so cold. I mean, if you want. - Yeah, sure. - Cool. [wind howling] - It was colder than I realized. - Yeah, need a hot shower. - Thanks again for today. - Sure your work won't care? - Nah, I'll be fine. - Good. - I feel like I haven't seen Brad around lately. - Yeah. - He's doin' okay? - He's good. - How's living here going? - It's nice, but I never really thought I'd live in a building like this. - Don't like it? - Not really. Are you seeing anyone right now? - [grunts] I don't know. Not really. - No? - I dated someone for a long time. I haven't felt like getting back into something like that. - It's never easy. - No, not really. - Sometimes I think people just date someone so they don't have to get rejected. - Rejected how? - I don't know, just being in a relationship doesn't stop you from meeting people. You just know you don't have to go home to an empty bed. - Yeah, that's true, I guess. - I don't know, maybe it's just me. - No, I get it. [upbeat music] [guests chattering] Took a puff outta one of my friend's vapes and just was like giggling like a motherfucker. - That's pretty great. - Yeah, yeah, it was really funny. Remember how I was telling you about... Give it to me. - Well, why? What'd I do? - There's no fire. Look, it's already ripped. - I don't do that. So, where's this party that you went to, then? - It wasn't really like a party. It was like, we went to a cottage for New Year's. - Oh, okay, cool. - I told you about that. - Yeah, I remember now. It was a really fun time. Sounded like, anyways. I really wanna try that stuff. [gentle music] [notification chimes] [dramatic music] [swords clanking] [phone buzzing] - Hey. - [Sam] Hey. - What's up? - [Sam] Just at the mall. - Where's, Brad? - [Sam] He's around. - [Ryan] Tie shopping? - [Sam] Yeah, bein' oblivious somewhere. Do you wanna go for a walk tomorrow? [wind whistling] - Do you know where we are? - Yeah, pretty much. - I don't recognize anything. - Yeah, but the trail slopes this way. It means we're heading towards the lake. - I never noticed that before. - I'm sure you have. Just never thought about it. - Ooh! - You all right? [water babbling] [bright music] [waves crashing] [group chattering] - Coulda gone to my place. - We could have. - Or we could have gone out. - Could have. - What do you wanna do? - Doesn't matter. - Okay, well, I don't really wanna just sit around here. - Do you wanna go see a movie? - I don't really like movies - You wanna go smoke? - Who are the guys out there? - Paul's friends from work. - Okay, we could hang out with them. - No. - Okay. - [Ryan] You missed ball on Thursday. - Yeah, I had to write a paper. - [Ryan] Let's walk down to Gigi and get a slice. [bus rumbles] [phone buzzing] - [Actor] They freed you, so you leave them to me. - Want me to pause it? - No, it's okay. Where do you find these phones? - [Sam] Come pick me up. - Are you all right? - [Sam] Yeah, of course. - Where are you? - [Sam] Downtown at Queen and Gladstone. Just come get me. [actor chattering] - Just gonna go out for a bit. [Paul grunts] Just gonna go meet a few people from work. - [Paul] I'm gonna finish this. - Yeah, no worries. - [Actor 1] You really think so, comrade? - [Actor 2] It will take strength. [Actor 1 grunts] Such strength can come only from God. - We need to have rules. - Like what? - Like we can't do anything at each other's apartments. - [Ryan] Sounds good. - And we can't do anything stupid. - Like this? - This is just old-fashioned. Hey. Hey, it's okay. - I know. - Do you have any rules? - No. I mean, I don't know. - What do people do that you hate? - [Ryan] Drunk dialing. - Okay. Deal. Nothing else? - [Ryan] No. - Okay. [both breathing heavily] - No, no, no, no, not here, not here. - [Sam] Shh. - Sam, Sam, there's someone there. Sam, Sam, he's watching, he's watching! - [Sam] Who? Don't worry. I'm sorry if that wasn't very good. Goddamn steering wheels. You okay? [engine rumbles] We're going? Oh God. You're taking me home, aren't you? Look, I don't need to go home. Let's just drive for a bit. Hey, relax. - [Ryan] I'm relaxed. - It was stupid to do that. - [Ryan] Yeah. - We're okay, though? - [Ryan] We're fine. - If you're gonna take me home, just let me out here. Just in case. - Okay. - I'll call you. - Yup. [phone buzzing] Hello? - [Sam] Hey. I'm supposedly out getting hot chocolate. - Yeah? - [Sam] Yeah. What are you doing on Monday night? - Supposed to go to some dinner. - Brad's gotta go to Montreal for the night. I'm gonna get us a hotel. - [Ryan] Okay. - [Sam] You'll come? - Yes. - Hey. - Hey. - You doin' okay? - Yeah, good. This is nice. - Let me help you with this. [Ryan sighing] - What are you doing? - Gotta go to that dinner. - You're actually going? - Said I would. - What am I supposed to do? - I don't know, I told you I had a dinner. - Yeah, I didn't think you'd actually go. - Well, I have to. - All right. You're not gonna shower? You stink. - [Ryan] Whatever. I'll come back. - [Vanda] He's a smart guy. He's like, you know, maybe parties too much. - [Tom] Got a head tattoo, though. - Yeah. - Like, where on his head? - [Vanda] So it was kinda strange. - The skull? - No, like, on his head, like shaved. - So, like, elevator engineer? Meaning I operate the elevator. - [Ryan] What's goin' on? - [Sam] Nothin'. It stopped snowing. - Yeah. Must've been a game tonight. [gentle music] I shouldn't have gone. - It's okay. - It was dumb. - Don't worry about it, really. - What'd you do? - Went to the train station, walked around. - Yeah. - Haven't been since they renovated. - I'm sorry. - I know. [sultry music] [Sam breathing heavily] Go slow. [water pattering] You shouldn't wash your hair so much. I'm just saying, it's not good for your hair to wash it so often. - [Ryan] Yeah. - [Actor] And who was he? - [Ryan] Fuck. - [Sam] What? - Forgot my overnight bag. - [Sam] Can use my stuff. - [Ryan] Nah. - [Actor] Get me the county jail. I want the superintendent- - [Sam] Go down to the concierge, then. They'll have a little kit or whatever. - Yeah? - [Sam] In a place like this, for sure. - [Actress] Got to be Elizabeth Baker's daughter. - [Actor] Hello. [water pattering] - [Ryan] Are you awake? - Yes. - [Ryan] Are you hungry? - Yes. Hi. Would it be possible for you to bring up a couple of bowls of ice cream? Flavor? - Vanilla. - A strawberry and a vanilla. Thanks. - [Actor] You or me? And unless you do it now, it'll be you. [dramatic music] [Ryan groans] - You don't have to work today, do you? - No. Told them I'd be on late. - Check out's at 11. - So, just kind of like a trial run before you invite a real couple over? - Who says you guys are the first? - Seems like we're the first. V? - First for sure. - If that makes you guys happy. - [Sam] Dinner's almost ready. - Ya know when you asked me to come, I assumed when you said dinner, you meant like a bunch of people for dinner. - Like who? Good? - Yeah, perfect. - Well, a toast then to the first dinner club. [glasses clinking] What have you guys been up to lately? - Nothing. - Something? - No, actually. Nothing. Like, I go to work, I go to the gym, then I come home. - Winter. What about you, Ry? - Not much either. Working a lot. - Is that right? - Yeah, lots of work. - Anything good going on? - Same shit. Had to go outta town recently. - Yeah? Where? - London. - How was it? - Wet. What about you, V? - Tish and I are supposed to be going to South America at the end of the month. - Where in South America? - Belize for sure, and then maybe like Paraguay? I don't know for sure. - What's in Belize? - You sure this is fine? - Yeah, my parents are in Florida. Want a drink? - Naw, I'm good. - I know. - Funny. - Here, come on. - You have a room here? - Yeah, it comes in handy. - [Ryan] So, is this where you grew up? - No, nearby. They moved here after I went to school. - [Ryan] Right. [water pattering] [phone ringing] - [Maya] Hello? - Hey, what's goin' on? - [Maya] Nothin', just layin' on my couch. - [Ryan] Oh yeah? - [Maya] Yeah, Darcy's making me a grilled cheese. - Nice. Hungover? - [Maya] Not really. - Good, that's good. - [Maya] Yeah. - So, what are you doin' tonight? - [Maya] I'm supposed to go to a concert with my friends Owen and Susie. - Oh, cool. - [Maya] Yeah, do you know the band Bobby and Reese? They're playin' at the Hideout tonight. - Yeah, sure. That'll be fun. - [Maya] Yeah, hopefully. - I was actually just callin' to see if you wanted to go out tonight, but don't worry about it. - [Maya] I mean, honestly, Ryan, do you even want to? - Yeah. - [Maya] Like, it's fine. Okay, I don't know what's going on, but like, it's cool. Don't feel like you need to call and ask. - I want to. - [Maya] I don't know. It seems beyond you to even try. - I'm sorry. - Or care. - [Maya] You never called. Or texted. It's fine. - Oh, okay, okay. Well, let me make it up to you. - [Maya] No, not today or tomorrow. Just, like, let it be for awhile. Call me again after you've thought about it. - Okay, I will. - [Maya] Darcy's here with the food, though, so... - Yeah. - [Maya] Later, Ryan. - Bye. [disconnection tone beeps] [tense music] - How is it? What's the badlands snow like? [tense music continues] [water pattering] [tense music continues] 17? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. [fire crackling] [Ryan slurping] - Get that craziness outta here. "You've gone to see a nude show with business associates. The next day your spouse asks how you spent the evening. Do you tell the truth?" - Why are you at a nude show with business associates? - Networking? I don't know. - Addendum to that. You break your legs, right? And it's your favorite sister. Whose son is it? - Aww, geez. - This is assuming you [indistinct]. [wind whistling] If you could go anywhere, where would you go? - [Sam] I've always wanted to go to Japan. - [Ryan] Yeah. - [Same] I think I'd really jibe with the culture. [water babbling] - [Actor] Otto! [gun firing] - Oh, fuck. - Sorry, guys, gimme a minute. There's beer in the fridge. Where do you guys wanna go? - [Ryan] Doesn't matter. - What? What? Sorry? - [Ryan] Said I don't care. - [Paul] I just don't want Chinese. I had it yesterday. - What about that new burger place on Dupont? It's walkable. [phone ringing] - Hey, what are you up to? - [Sam] Just leavin' a friend's place. - Paul's out for the night. - [Sam] Oh really? - Uh-huh. - I don't recall saying you could finish. Come here. So serious when you've cum. - Fuck, fuck. It's six. You need to go home. Get dressed. [Ryan yawns] Bye. - Bye. [chuckles] Thanks. [Ryan yawns] [Paul coughs] [objects thudding] [Paul sighs] - Paul. - Ryan. - What's up? - Gonna play squash with Kent. - Where at? - Just at the AC. - How'd things with Becca go last night? - She threw up. Things only got better from there. - Jesus. - Yeah, stayed for a bit, but had to get the fuck outta there. - Yeah, no kidding. - And how about you last night? - Nothing really? - No? - That girl from work came over. - Hmm. How was that? - Pretty standard. - Good to hear, good to hear. Well, gotta go. - All right, I'll see you later. - [Paul] Yeah, yeah, see ya later. - Fuck. [phone ringing] [phone buzzing] Hello? - [Sam] Sorry, had to wait for Brad to go out. - Paul came home last night. - [Sam] When? - I don't know, he was here when you left. - [Sam] So? - So he knows. - [Sam] Knows what? - About us. - [Sam] Did you say something? - No, but how could he not know? - [Sam] What did you tell him? - Some girl from work came over. - [Sam] Hmm. - I had to tell him something. What if he tells Brad? - [Sam] Why would he? - We're supposed to be friends. - [Sam] He won't tell him. It's gonna be fine. - I can't do this anymore. - [Sam] What? - Any of it. - [Sam] I agree last night was stupid, but- - Aren't you worried? - [Sam] He won't say anything. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - [Sam] What? - Why aren't you freaking out? Jesus, if he tells Vanda, it's over. - [Sam] Calm down. - People are gonna get hurt behind this. - [Sam] Like you. - Yeah, or, like, fucking Brad. - [Sam] Meet me at the cafe. - Should we be seen together? - [Sam] Would you relax? - When can you meet? - [Sam] After work. Like, seven. It'll be dead there. - Hey. - Hey. - Do you want anything? - No, I'm fine. - You all right? Come on, you know what I mean. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine beyond the obvious. - Have you spoken to Paul? - No, he didn't come back this afternoon. - So, you don't know anything for sure. - Sam? - What? He might not have noticed. - Your fucking clothes were all over the living room. - Yeah. Thanks. - [Ryan] So he obviously noticed. - He might not have. - [Ryan] He did. - Okay. So? - [Ryan] What are we gonna do? - What can we do? - I can't see you anymore. - [Sam] Relax, really. Everything's gonna be fine. No one's gonna care. - It's not fine. - I know. It's not right now, but it will be. - [sighs] No. - Really, Ry, just give it a few days. You're just freakin' yourself out. - So fuckin' stupid. - Ry, come on. Tomorrow it won't seem so bad. - Never shoulda done this. It was wrong from the start. - [Sam] Wrong? - If Paul tells people. - What? That you're gay. - [Ryan] Don't. - Please don't pull this shit. - I'm not fuckin' gay. - What was this then? - A mistake. I fucked up. - This is, like, really pathetic. - Just don't call me anymore, okay? - Stop it. - It didn't happen. - Is that what you're gonna do? - [Ryan] It didn't happen. - I know you have feelings for me. - I don't. - I know you do. Come on, Ry, don't do this. I promise, things will be fine. - I'm gonna go. Meeting was a bad idea. - Ry, come on, stay. Please. - Forget my number. Delete it. - [Actor] And I kept sayin', "Oh, that's fine, but how's a guy gonna poke around lovin' the kind of neighbors we got?" Old sourpuss for instance. Ya see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy lives all alone next door to us. He's a cranky old man and runs a secondhand furniture store. We haven't spoken to him for years. [balls bouncing] [players chattering] [phone buzzing] - [Man] Hey. - Hey. - [Man] Where are you from? - Canada. - [Man] Me, too. - Cool. - [Man] Toronto? - Yeah. You? - [Man] Yeah. We should meet up sometime. - Yeah, totally. - [Man] Get a hotel. I'll pay. Where do you live? Wait, let me guess. Parkdale? - You've been busy lately. - Yeah. - Doing what? [visitor knocking] - I'm sorry. - Go around the side! - Stop it, I fuckin' live here, man. - [Sam] What? - Can you not come on to me in my backyard? - I'm sorry. - You need to go, Sam. - I'm gonna end it with Brad. - If that's what you want, we aren't gonna date. - Not right away. - Not ever. - Brad will get over it. - There wasn't a party after the game last week. - So? - So, Paul probably told everyone. - Fuck them. We can make this work. - [Ryan] I don't date men. - Ry. - This is a mistake. - It could be the start of somethin' really great. - Won't be. - Just give it a little time. - You may have thought what was going on was some emotional thing, but it wasn't, not for me. - I know how you felt. - You don't. I was bored. I was bored and you were there. - You're such a coward. - Listen, Sam, Sam! Don't tell Brad! Hey. What are you doing tonight? [somber piano music] I didn't know you dressed up so much for work. - Well, I don't usually, but I'm tryin' this new thing where I don't dress like I'm homeless. - How's it going? - Fine, I just started. I used to dress like a grown up. I don't know what happened. - Where's Tish? - Oh, it's so gross. She's dating this married guy. - Really? - Yeah. They do weird things. Like, they go out every night, but, like, go to play pool 'cause they think they won't get caught. - Do they come back here all the time? - No, I don't know where they stay. She's, like, never here. - Weird. - Keep talking, I'm just gonna get changed. - Okay. What's with the luggage? - [Vanda] I'm going to Belize in a couple of days. Didn't I tell you. - [Ryan] No. Who with? - Just Tish. - [Ryan] That'll be fun. - Yeah, you wanna come? - Think I'll pass. - Your loss. - For sure. - Actually, do you mind if I pack? - Nope. - Great. - [Actor] Only the victim is alive and the murderers are not. It's a pity you didn't know when you started your game of- - Can I ask you a random question? - Yeah. - [Actor] That I was playing, too. - You wanna have sex? - Like, right now? - Sure. - [Actress] He must. He's always getting in here. - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. - [Actress] Lance, I shot Mr. Lord. He's down in the wine cellar. - [Lance] Alive? - [Actress] I don't think so. - You should have asked earlier. I'm tired now. - I'm sorry, I assumed you say no. [object thudding] What the fuck was that? - [Vanda] Shh, it's just Tish. She does that when she wants me to get up. - [Ryan] What? - [Vanda] Just ignore her. [soft guitar music] - You fucked Vanda, eh? - Yeah. - That's pretty fucked up. - Why? - You know she likes you. - [Ryan] Yeah, maybe. - Ya know, just cause you're fucked up doesn't mean you can mess with her. [soft guitar music] - [Actor] She's never to leave the house unless I know where she's going. If for any reason I can't be found, she's to be detained no matter on what pretext. Understand, Sarah? [phone buzzing] - [Sam] Ryan? - Yeah. - [Sam] I need you to come meet me. - I can't. - [Sam] Come to the beach. - I can't. - [Sam] I just really need your help, okay? - I can't. - [Sam] Ryan, please, just come. I need to talk to you. - I can't. - [Sam] [crying] I don't know who to call. Brad won't answer. - Sam. - [Sam] Please, you can come. - I have to go now. - [Sam] Please, Ryan, please. [disconnection tone beeps] [somber music]
