Excuse me, ma'am. Gonzalez, We're ready for your dissertation. OK, but Charly is doing the beatbox. What's that? It's like the beat of the song. Are you going to sing? I'm not gonna sing, I'm gonna rap. It's not the same. Quiet! Listen to your classmate. C'mon, let's go Charly. The stage is yours. Just hit it. These streets aren’t pretty, like Neruda said, The streets are getting rougher,I tell you, Dark corners, drugs, and madness, Niko's graffiti welcomes you to Quilicura, I'm flying through this grey cloud, The people in this city don't know how to be happy, Screaming and fighting all the time, Noise and car horns are their soundtrack, Ugly-ass publicity in the streets, And the poor die in their own backyard, How ironic, first drought, then floods, Water runs through the streets, no love among the people, It's painful what we have to go through, We get high to get away from it all, I can't be happy with this black smoke. Spewing out of the smokestack, fucking up the view, I express myself through my music, And I got so much shit built up inside me that sometimes I explode, Cuz when I rap, nothing can stop me, And I'll call you a motherfucker right to your face! Leave the classroom immediately. But ma'am… - Me too? - You too. But I was just beatboxing! Get out of the classroom! Fuck me! Take it easy brother. You, come with me. You, go back inside. Let's go. Martin Gonzalez student record… March 23, student caught tagging the classroom. September 25, student calls a classmate "a stupid asshole". And the list goes on and on… Six, ten, twelve reports. But nothing serious, sir. What do you want to do when you finish school, Martin? You're not a bad kid. You just seem lost. No. What do you mean, "no"? I mean that you're right, sir. Mr. Principal. This is not a prison, We're not your enemies. You want to come here wearing earrings with your pants below the waist? Then do so. We won't bother you here. We only want you to show some respect and comply with the school's policies. I come From a small neighbourhood From my street And you? Aren't you supposed to be in school? I got out early. Good, then you can help me. I have to move some boxes to the new apartment. Let's go. Can I help you later? I'm busy now. Martin, you gotta help out a little, man. Yeah, I know. How about tomorrow? Tomorrow we're moving out. And you haven't packed any of your stuff at all! Okay. come on let's go Okay, I'm going. I mean now! Yes, okay, I heard you! I'm leaving in 5 minutes! Okay! And open the window to get some fresh air in here. MARTIN FINDS A GUN You really want to make a living as a musician? Yeah. You do realize that nobody in this country makes a living as an artist. Especially with music. You know that, right? I'm not sure about that. Why don't you get a job this summer? So that you can help out the family. Stop fucking around, Martin. Stop it. So, which one is my room? The one down the hall. and Nati's room? The same room. - What do you mean, "the same room"? - The same room. Your mother and I are sharing one room, and you and your sister will share the other one. You've got to be kidding me. No, I'm serious. What the hell... What about my computer? And my things? My music studio?! I don't know Martin, I guess you'll have to set it up here in the living room. Or put all that stuff in storage until you get your own place. I don't know. Look, Martin, I know this isn't easy. But we need to be flexible. Until things get better. It is what it is. The dynamic duo What's up guys? Hey, today is Javiera's party. But we should prepare for the radio show. What are you going to do on the radio? Promoting our show, bro. Hang out and play some tracks... Can I go? Why? To talk about how you don't do shit all day. That's cold man. No, really. You should come Gigio. We need all the support we can get. Is this the first interview bro? Yeah man, the first. I'm excited. Yeah, but you need to speak clearly man. I can speak well if I want to. If I need to be serious, I can be serious. Get out of here! The only time I saw this guy serious was when Tami told him she was pregnant. That's cold Gigio! Can I play a tune? Not if it's the same one from the other day. Why? It's a good sample, man. Yeah but you played it all day! Just let me show it to Tommy I haven't heard it bro. It's a good track, but he played it like a hundred times. - Let him play it. - He says it's good. - Which one is it, bro? - This one. - That sample is dope. - Tell me you don't like it now! - We need to finish the lyrics. - Hey, I got some lyrics. It's mostly an idea. Something I got in my head. Oh, so you're a rapper now? - Let's hear it then. - Over the track. - C'mon. - C'mon Gigio. Ok, ok let's see. Kick it bro! - Want a beatbox? - Do that beatbox, bro. Okay, go. - Okay, ready. - C'mon, man! Okay, here we go. C'mon, man, spit the damn bars. Gimme time to feel the beat, man! - Go, go, just do it! - Go, go! It's a... it's a... Crazy ass thing walking down the street with a broken heart, Everytime I think of you, Macarena, Damn I loved her, but she was such a slut, C'mon guys! Don't make fun of me. - You went to far bro. - You really went out there, Gigio! Still thinking about Maca! Dude, it's a rhyme! You guys are a bunch of assholes. - C'mon Gigio don't be mad. - It's all good, man. Hey you heading over to see Maca? Get in the car already. There's Jean. Oh yeah. What's up motherfuckers! - What's up guys? - Good man. How about you bro? Okay guys, I need some money for gas. I have some but it's for the booze. Relax, I have some. Damn it Gigio, you didn't say we had to bring gas money. What do you think this is? A cab? Fuck yeah, you're my Uber driver. This piece of shit car an Uber? No fucking way. Ok stop fighting, I got a little money here. My nigga! Hey. You got any chocolate? Look, all those in front of you are chocolates. Right. It's just... I just smoked a joint and I'm baked. Anything I can get for your friends? I don't know, I mean, no. - Maybe, I don't know. - They're not my friends. Only one of them, that one. Which one? The one putting that bottle in his jacket? No, not that one. Relax, man. I don't care. what? I don't care man. If you rob the store or blow up something, I don't care. I'm not getting a raise for preventing that shit. What's up with Hueso? Why is he telling his life story to that guy? Maybe they caught us. Fuck, maybe. Maybe he saw us when we walked in. Now what? Should we split? - Yeah let's go. - Let's go jean. Fuck man, I don't know what to say. You got a joint? What is he doing? You think he's gonna call the cops? I don't think so. He saw me and didn't do shit. Everybody saw you, Tommy. You're gonna be in one of those shows from the Discovery channel... "Dumbest robberies of all time!" It slipped out of my hands! Butterfingers! Here he comes. Finally. Yeah baby! Guys, if you see a cop, you have to tell me right away. My car isn't registered. Okay guys, let's do it quick. Hurry up! - What? We're late? - Yeah, Gigio, where are we going? Man, we already talked about it. We're going to Javiera's party. That girl only hangs out with rich dudes. Let's go check it out anyway. And then we'll see if we stay, or go somewhere else. Hey guys, I have some spray-paint in my bag. Let's go tag some shit. I'm in bro. Sure, let's stink of spray-paint instead of making out with beautiful girls. C'mon bro, just one graffiti. Hey guys, my boys want to party with us. - No, no. - How? This isn't a minivan, man. I'm not riding squashed. But they're helping out with our video tomorrow! Where do you want me to put them? On the roof? Look how big he is. Tell them we're full. Use your head Charly. Start the engine! Go! Go! Let's leave him with his friends. See ya Charly! Shit! Bye Guys. Hey, come back! Here we are with Charly from the local rap group De la Urbe. So tell us, Charly, how did the group come together? Just rapping with the boys. Also with Bones Making tracks. One thing led to another, and that's it. That's how De la Urbe was born. Damn, that's a lame ass answer. And bang! The band was born! We're just rehearsing. It's like those football players interviews. "Well, we expected better" It's not that easy bro. When you're doing an interview, you get nervous. What would you say bro? I would say that our rap group De la Urbe was born in 2015, and after doing several collaborations, we decided that it was time to take a leap forward and express our social discontent with an album. Get outta here! You're so full of shit. Hey guys, did you know We only use ten percent of our brain? I mean Einstein bro, Einstein only used ten percent. And us mere mortals bro.... We don't even use five percent. Dude, we have like millions of neurons in our brain. A lot… And each time you make a header playing soccer, You lose a million. each time you drink, you lose another million. But bro, even if you smoke up a joint every day, or drink everyday, or hit your head against the wall everyday, you'd still end up with millions of neurons in your head. Yeah, but you’re gonna run out of neurons eventually Tommy. I can see this guy when he gets old. "Hey guys, I'm tommy”. No man. You gotta keep a couple of millions for the end you know. No man, it's not like that. I don't want to get old with a healthy body. You know? I want a body that's been used. Like a washed up old man. You follow me Charly? You're bugging out Tommy. You don't know shit Charly. "I want to have scars”. "from my life experiences". So, how do the Chileans treat you? The boys or the girls? So you're doing fine with the girls. I can't complain. - How old are you? - How old do you thing? - Twenty five - That old? That's not old. - Nineteen. - Nineteen! You're just a baby. I'm twenty six. You look much younger. I don't think so. What do you do? Study? Work? I'm working on a "play" - Really? A play? - I mean construction. Obviously you can't. - Or can you buddy? - I'm not your buddy. Take it easy man, I'm just fucking with you. Ok buddy? You think you're all that. Because you go to college and have money. But you don't have spirit, and you lack intelligence. That's some dark shit, man. What did you say? I said that's some dark shit, motherfucker! The fuck did you say! Stupid Motherfuckers! Fucking Snobs! But what did he say to you? No Charly, No no! He said I was his buddy. I'm not his buddy. It's OK Jean, don't worry about it. You dumb motherfuckers. How could you assholes be so fucking stupid? It was a good party, and you Jean, you had to start a fight? They attacked me. ¿What was I supposed to do? We're not letting anybody hit Jean. Imagine if they hit you! In that case, I'm not sure if I would help out. You think you're funny motherfucker? You know what? Go fuck yourselves. Get the fuck out of the car. - Get out! - Dude, what the fuck? Get the fuck out now, man! Fuck off! You assholes are always busting my balls! You make fun of me, then you fuck things up with my girl and my friends! You start shit at the party! What the fuck, guys?! Relax, man. What the hell, is that the police? Relax man, you're getting paranoid. Fuck guys, it's the cops! Take it easy, Gigio, we haven't done anything wrong. - I can't go to jail man. - Shut the fuck up man! - They left! - We're safe man! Yeah! These buds are the shit, man. - Where are they from? - It's a limited edition my man. What's up my nigga? Brother, that wasn't just luck. It means something. We got lucky, man. This shit only happens once in a lifetime. This always happens to me. Like the street lights. Man, it's true. What's this about the street lights, Martin? - You don't know? - No. This guy can turn off street lights. - Really? - Is it true? Yeah, when I'm like going through some shit, you know. What? You just stand under it and it turns off? Man I don't know. It's really mystical you know? I stand under a lamppost, and it turns off. I don't know why. - You mean like magic? - Black magic! - Cunt! - It's all good, brother. I don't know why or how, but when I stand under a street light, it shuts off. That shit happens to me too. It's because these street lights are shitty. But it always happens to me. Okay, let's see, Martin. Go stand under that light and turn it off. Alright. This guy thinks he's from the Marvel universe! Wait for it. - Fucking liar! - You're full of shit. Wait, man. It works almost every time. Hey guys, let's go up the hill. Are you crazy? It's freezing cold. It's cold man. C'mon, let's do it anyway. But it's freezing man. Fuck the cold, let's go! This guy's gonna throw up, man. Tommy? Hey Tommy, want to go up the hill? That's an ugly ass city. I like it. You see that factory over there? I'm gonna work there, and my brother too. I wish we didn't have to work, ever. I wish we could live off our music. You really think you can make a living rapping? Nobody's buying albums anymore. But you can still play gigs. Rappers don't go to concerts, even if it's free. You still have to try though. Man, you're all gonna end up working somewhere you hate. Look who's talking! Fucking bum. My lungs aren't for sale, man. Not like you, flipping burgers for the man. Fucking Spongebob. At least I'm providing for my family, my son. Not like you, you fucking momma's boy. You ain't providing shit! You don't even see your son! The fuck did you say, Gigio? Say that again, motherfucker! Stop talking out your ass, man! Take it easy guys. You look like little kids. It's because of this fucking guy. Shut up Gigio. There's a TV here. Fuck me! What the fuck! Is that shit loaded? What the fuck, bro? I found it here, right over there. We can sell that shit, or we can use it for the video. No man, just leave it there. It's only trouble man, get rid of it. - Fuck man. - Put it away bro, be careful. - Leave it man, - Leave it there. Let's go. I don't want to go home man. Don't worry, man. In any case, you're strapped now. No man, seriously. keep that thing well hidden. Yeah. - See ya. - See ya bro. Where were you? With my friends at a party. How was it? You had a good time? It was cool. Martin, the school called yesterday. They said you got suspended. Yeah but it wasn't fair. I’m sure it wasn’t. Cursing at your teacher like that. I didn't curse. It's not like that. And instead of coming home after your fuck up, you go out like nothing happened. What am I suppose to do? Cry in my room? You should at least have packed your things. You're so childish Martin. Extremely childish. Always looking for trouble. Well now you found it. Congrats! Seriously, congratulations. And now he's gonna miss school graduation. I don't care. That's the problem. You don't care about anything. It's all the same to you. You know damn well what we're going through as a family. We don't need another problem. And what do you do? You bring more problems. Son, I left some boxes in your room, for you to pack your things. The moving truck is coming at one o'clock. SOL SEARCHES FOR CANELA Did you leave water for Canela? She already ate and drank. No more food for her or she will be fat. What's the name of this band? Doctor Pez. It's good but, a bit sad, don't you think? Yeah, like melancholic. Not everything can be like, "let's go Chile, get up!" Yes, but it doesn't have to be all pain either, like "I'm gonna die this Friday morning". I thought you liked him. I said it wasn't bad. No, you said he was good but… Isn't it the same? No, it's similar, but not the same. Okay. Nothing wrong with a little melancholy once in a while. Bye Mom. Bye, take care. Always. Sol. Good luck in the game, don't let them score. Of Course not. Good luck to you too. Thank you. - I love you. - I adore you. Sir? I'm sorry, I don't understand. Look, the issue about perspective is that it has been built on top of the conflict that represents the real concept. The real truth would be the capacity of assuming that one part of the world is seen as steady and invariable. But at the same time, we know things are always in motion. Things change depending on circumstances. When we start thinking that things can't change, then this element introduces a new factor that completely modifies the order. Do you understand? Sir, can I go to the bathroom? Yes, you can go. Thank you. I want to see you too. I couldn't make it yesterday, but today I can. No. No, don't be a crybaby. Hey! Nice shot! My ankle! It hurts! It hurts! Don't touch me! It hurts! Don't touch me! Let me see. Yes! it hurts! Let's take her to the infirmary. I think It's a sprained ankle. Walk slowly. Let's go. Help me. Walk slowly. Aren't you going to kick her out? It was an accident. But she almost broke her ankle. Who's kicking the penalty? - C'mon. - Okay, let's go. Goal! Sol, we're gonna switch. Marcela is in, okay? Okay. Let's go, let's go, let's go! Hey there. You came for a tattoo? Yes You know what you want? Not yet, but... How long is it going to take? Did you make an appointment? I did. Half an hour? Okay, I'll wait. Hi. Hi. Franco, here's your food? Great, thanks. I'm heading to the university. I'm late. Ok, have a nice day. Take care. Bye Honey. Your girlfriend is pretty. Yeah, she's cool. Yeah I can tell. She has style, you know? So, are you getting a tattoo or not? It depends. Depends on what? I don't know. I need to find something I really like. Haven't you thought of one yet? Yeah. But I want to be a hundred percent sure. They're permanent, you know. Well if you overthink it, then you'll never get one. You're mean. I'm not being mean. It's true. That's why people end up with shitty tattoos, like the one you got there. Some people get tattoo of their parents, or favorite soccer teams. And movies? Not so many. I'd get a tattoo of a movie. Which movie? I don't know, one that I like. Where would you want the tattoo? On my leg I think. Maybe a little higher, near my hip. C'mon, Sol, don't do that. What do you mean? You know what I mean. I thought we were going to your apartment. If we go, we know what's gonna happen. Boring. Boring but peaceful. Boring. Hey. Want to see a movie? You want a drink? No. Here you go. Why won't you have a drink? Want a beer? No thanks. Don't you have School today? Yes but I got out early. I've got to get back to work soon. Relax. I'm leaving soon. I really don't want you to go. I would stay here with you all day. But you have to go. Sol, c'mon, don't be like that. I don’t want to bother you. I'm gonna leave, but give me 5 minutes. I beg you to leave. And don't make a scene. Don't call the neighbours, it won't do no good. I see what you're doing. But can you tell me why? Sol. what happened to your cellphone? I called you 40 times. My battery ran out. What's the matter? - Where were you? - At school. You're lying. Where were you? Where were you? What's going on? Why are you acting like this? Canela escaped. Mom, I've told you a thousand times to be careful when you take the car out! I am careful! It wasn't my fault! Goddamnit! I guess Canela opened the gate by herself? Maybe she jumped over it. How is that even possible mom? The gate is like 2 meters high and Canela is old. Canela. Who's the prettiest dog? Who's the prettiest dog? Hi. Sorry to bother you, but does the air pump work? No, the hose is busted... I mean, the valve is missing... I mean the needle. Damn. I need to put air in my tire. Did it get punctured? I don't know . It started to lose air and now it's flat. If the air is gone, that means it got punctured. So you don't have the needle for this thing? No, we never had one. It got stolen so many times, they stopped replacing it. Ok, I'm gonna head out then. Thanks. Wait, want to hit this joint with me? No, thanks. Ok, it's cool, I'm just trying to be nice. Hey, have you seen a dog around here by any chance? A boxer. A boxer? Yeah, the type of dog that has a flat face, like it was smashed. Yeah I know them. Did you lose yours? What's her name? Canela. Damn that sucks. No. Sometimes you love animals more than people. They’re more sincere and less toxic. Okay, I'll hang out with you for a while. Awesome. I was bored. At this time of night only losers come by. Like me? No, not you. I mean assholes, you know? Let me try it. Of course. And? It's good. You're weird. What the fuck! Don't worry, man. In any case, you're strapped now. - See ya bro. - See ya. CHARLY IS LATE Fuck! Do you want the job or not? Yes, I need the job. Charly, seriously, if you don't want the job, just tell me. There's a lot of people out there looking for work. I get applications every day. From people who want to work. People who want to work. Not lazy ass kids who only want to party. So if you don't want it, just tell me. And we'll leave it like that. I swear it won't happen again. You know I need this job. It's not for me, it's for my kid. I know you need it, but this is the last time. Now go clean up the bathrooms. Hey Charly, Juan needs you in the kitchen. Fuck me! That old bastard can't give me a break. Yeah, he can be an asshole. Are you ok? One day I'm gonna grab him and cook him in his own kitchen, with two fried eggs on his head. Did you go out last night? Nothing. Fought with a bottle of rum. Silly. you? I didn't go out. I watched a TV series. Cool. which one? Uncertain Future. Never heard of it. It's been a while since I've watched TV. It's been a while since I've been out. We're opposites. Always. Today I'm gonna be on the radio with my homies. Really? With your band? Which station? Victor Jara radio. Cool. It's great that people are starting to hear about you. Yep. I'm not planning on flipping burgers all my life. Me neither. As soon as I finish my studies, I'm out. Cool, Maybe you'll end up in charge, and you can send that moron to clean the toilets. I wish. Did you wash your hands? Yes. You're lying. I saw you. You smell like cigarettes. Go wash your hands please. Daniela's a hotty, don't you think? Excuse me. Thank you! Hello? Hello? Hi. What are you doing here? I came to see Dani. You finally remember that you have a son? Dani is sleeping. - I brought you a bit of cash. - A bit of cash? You think I can buy diapers with "a bit of cash"? You think I can buy milk with "a bit of cash"? Relax, I just want to help. Just go away Charly. Really. We're doing just fine without you. Hey, but I'm the father. I have the right to see him. Yeah, only when it suits you. When have you ever taken responsibility? You don't even come by once a week. It's because I can't. Oh, but you can party all night with your friends? I'd like to take a few pictures of him. We're making a music video with the guys. I'd like for him to be in it. Dani is sleeping, and later today we're going to see my mom. C'mon. I've never asked you for anything. Just this once. You never ask for him, you never come to get him, you never take responsibility. No, you can't take him. I was having lunch with my boyfriend and having a good time. So please just go away, okay? Tamara... No. Tamara! Hey, please! Tami! Hey! What's up, Bones? No. No, I'm not gonna make it. But I'm on my way. I’ll join you once I get there. I just got off work. Give me a break! Bye. Hey there. Take this. THE CAR ACCIDENT You can't keep putting yourself at risk like that. What if something had happened to you? Okay, but nothing happened, Mom. And if something had happened, it would've been your fault. Sorry. I'm sorry. I just don't know what to do. I miss Canela so much. This morning I saw her dirty plate, and her water bowl and… Where is she? This isn't your dog? You're sure? Because they all look alike. I can't believe people would leave them there. And with that awful smell. It's better than leaving them on the streets. Here, at least they get fed. How can you say that mom? How can it be better? What are those motherfuckers spending their money on? Watch your language, Sol. I don't want you talking like that There's a lot of shit that's happening that I don't like either, you know? I don't like being here, I don't like this situation, this mess. I don't like my dog going missing for Christ's sake! Calm down! You calm down now! You're exaggerating all of this. You're acting like an idiot. You're the only idiot mom. Because you let Canela runaway. Wait a minute Sol. Where were you when Canela went missing? Because I still don't know where you were. And I'm guilty? You're responsible for this also. If you had been at home, Canela wouldn't be lost. Mom, you lost Canela, you lost her! You were the one who left the door open! Why did we stop? Let's go! No, we're not going anywhere until you tell me where you were. Why should you care where I was? Why do you want to know? Why do you want to control my life? Leave me alone! Don't talk to me like that! I'm your mother! You hear me? Look at me! You will respect me! OK, I may be clumsy, and a piece of shit to you, but I'm your mother. Look at me? I'm the only thing you’ve got. I'm your only family. And even if I'm stupid or dumb, I'm your mother! Do you know why I act this way? Do you? Because I'm tired, I'm exhausted Sol. I have feelings too. Or do you think I'm made of steel? I hate my job most of the time, but I keep going. You know why? For you. Because I love you. Because you're the most important thing in my life. Alright, I screwed up. What do you want me to do? Kill myself? I'm tired. Missing. I'm sorry. I don't want you to feel bad, This is also my fault. I was with my boyfriend. I didn't know you had one. He's not really my boyfriend, it's complicated. Do I know him? I don't think so. what's he like? Tall, light brown hair, he got tattoos. He's from school? No way, there are only kids at school. Where's he from? Santiago. I mean, where did you meet him? He's the one who did Javi's tattoo, I met him there He's older? Yeah, a little. But he's not that old, he's not like fifty you know. He's not fifteen either. Did you ask him for help? Yes, but he couldn't help me because he was working. I'm glad you have some sort of support in your life. Are you kidding me? I already told you where I was. With my boyfriend, you're happy? No, I'm not happy. Not happy at all Sol I thought you trusted me, but it turns out you have a boyfriend and he's older than you Mom, I don't have to tell you everything, and I tell you almost everything. You're wrong Sol. This Canela thing is affecting your judgement. What's wrong with you, mom? I'm telling you everything and you pull out this shit, The reason why you told me isn't because you trust me. You know why you told me? To laugh at me. To make me feel bad. OK mom, I planned it, and everything is about you. Yes. You knew I wouldn't approve your relationship. Especially with an older man. You knew how I would feel about that. I'm stopping at the pharmacy. This headache is driving me crazy. Do you want something? Sol, do you want something? Great. This is all I need right now. You punishing me with your indifference. - Hi. - Hi. And this car? My mom's car. It's nice. Are you busy? I'm with Vale. Of course. What's up Sol? It's Canela, Franco. I can't find her. What? Canela. She's gone, and I can't find her. Canela, your dog. I'm sorry. I'm desperate, Franco. I don't know what to do. Damn it Sol. I wish I could help out, but it's complicated for me, you know? You know, if they see me here in the car, with you crying, it looks weird, you know? Yeah super weird. They might think that you're giving me a tattoo in the car. Fuck, I'm sorry man. I'm really sorry. I feel bad for all this shit. It's ok. Relax, I thought you could, I don't know, but it's okay. It's all good. Seriously, it's okay. EVERYBODY LEAVES Mom? Hey dad! What about my things? Ok, bring them. I was going to pack them now. Now? Yeah. Now you're gonna do it? Yes. We told you twenty times to pack your stuff. Look Martin, you screwed up. Now you deal with it. C'mon man. - How do I move my things? - that's your problem. Not mine. We did our part by letting you know when we were leaving. Period. Melki! Close the truck, we're leaving. Hey. Nothing! But… Don't say nothing thing to me. How many times did I tell you? How many times? You knew about the foreclosure. And you did nothing. Why? Because you don't care. I can bring them now. Now? There's no time now. Then how do I move them? How should I know? Talk to your friends. Are they not your family? Mom, don't be like that, It doesn't help. Does the word "foreclosure" mean anything to you, Martin? This is legal stuff, you don't know nothing. Honey, stay out of this, ok? But mom, he's just so immature - Hey shut up ! - You shut up! I have no idea what you're going to do, you crossed the line, I swear. You crossed the line. Mom. Why don't you tell the truck driver to wait just thirty minutes? I'll get my stuff together real quick. No. Your dad is right. I'm sorry. Are we leaving now? Let's go. Martin! Where's Gigio? Did he answer you? Bro, you know he never answers unless he's bored or wants to go out. But for a favor, no way in hell. Tommy, there's no way my stuff is gonna fit in there. But man, Just take the important stuff. You have to be practical. How are you Estela? Good. Do you remember Bones? Martin? Yes. He's staying with us for a few days, ok? Okay. - Hi. - Hello son. Wow, shit man. It's like...

Art films, independent films! Porn! Erotica for that special someone! - What up Rata? - What's up guys? How's it going? Good, and you? Great man! What's up Tommy! We've been looking for you. Why, man? You're looking for a movie? A new release? No bro, for the music video. Was that today? You see, I told you he's always stoned, man. C'mon Rata! We were supposed to film today! Hey, just let me sell something. To make a little money and we can head out. Ok. How many movies for 5 bucks? So, you've been here before… You know more or less the dynamics. Yeah yeah it's all good. It would be cool if by the end you could spit some bars. Of course bro, totally. Did you bring some beats? - Yeah, yeah. - Got them in the flashdrive. Cool, later we'll pass them to Camilo. Okay, we need to start. Camilo, the intro. Bones, we're gonna start. Ok, coming. Charly. What do you mean "what's up"? We're about to start. But man, you have to come. Don't fuck this up! You said you'd come. Charly… Fucking prick. - We're all set. - Okay. Welcome everybody to a new transmission of "The Pleasure of the Damned" our weekly hip-hop show on our beloved Victor Jara Radio in Quilicura. Broadcasting to every Latin American corner thanks to our online signal. The guys from "De la Urbe" are here with us today. We're here with Bones and Tommy. Welcome guys, how are you? - Great bro, all good. - All good? Well, thanks for coming. But before we begin, Let's start with some music. and afterwards, we'll talk about this amazing track. Camilo, are we ready? - What's up Rata! - What's up bro! The stars keep showing up. I see Charly over there, who just arrived The third member of De la Urbe - Come in Charly. - Come in. C'mon. Should we wait for him? He doesn't want to. It's ok. - Let's continue then. - Okay. He's shy today. Well, give him a mic and a beat and he'll stop being shy. - Yeah man, Charly is fire. - Yes he is, we all know that. Let's continue with the interview. So you were telling me you started with nothing you've been building up, and you're all from here, Quilicura? Yes, we're all from Quilicura, all from the same part of town. Great. One of the special things about this place, It's like a brotherhood, like a hip hop family. - Yeah. - Totally. That's right. I don't know if it's always been that way, but there's a huge connection here Yeah. So that's why it's important that this family, shows up today for the filming of your music video. What time is the shooting? You have to be there at six. - Six o'clock. - Or half past six. - Six man! - Half past six, six Ok. Let´s leave it at six, so people can get there early. But not later than seven o'clock so the invitation is for all the rappers out there, and anyone else that feels part of this culture, go hang out with the group, because when you're starting a career you need the support. You're just getting started, right? So let's show some love to our local talents, because they represent all of us. So, to wrap this up, the question every guest on our show has to answer. - What does rap means to you? - Or what does hip-hop means to you? - Can I answer? - Yeah, go ahead. Rap... Rap is everything. It's... The way I express myself. It's... The way I think, a way to gather and arrange my ideas. It's the anger towards the system, but it's also poetry, It's the streets What's real, and true. You know? and hip-hop... Hip-hop... is my home. It's my home man. The place where I belong. Where I grew up. That's why I take care of it and it takes care of me. and that's why what we do here is so important. That's why our lyrics are so important. A lyric is like a son, you know? That's why it's so important, that's why we don't write bullshit, you know, over some shitty loop. You can't do that. This is an art form which we love infinitely, you know? That's it. Awesome. That was Bones, sharing amazing thoughts, from the band De la Urbe. It's been a pleasure my friends Bones, Tommy and Charly of course. Whom we will hear about next time. I wish you the best with your music video. Well, are you going to say something? What the fuck, man? Why weren't you at the interview? I couldn't make it, had shit to do. - What shit? - My shit. - Well, what type of shit? - My shit, what do you care? I care… I care obviously, because of this "shit" you didn't make it to the interview. Do you care about the group or not? I care, but I also have other shit to do. Brother, we all have other shit to do. I have shit to do. Tommy has shit to do. Rata has shit to do. But we put our shit aside so that we can be here to prep for the video to prep for the interview, you know? - Guys, take it easy. - Relax. Bro what's important now is to make the video. The interview went amazing, right Rata? - Amazing man. - Yeah. Easy man. I know it was amazing but the idea was for all of us to be there. I don't know, this shit killed my vibe. Then we're not filming shit! Ok we're not filming shit! - We're not shooting. - We're not filming. Because of you! - Hey Charly! - Fuck man! Guys, stop fucking around. I brought all my gear, man. I left my spot at the flea market. Don't fuck this up. Charly! Hey! - Hey man, c'mon! - What? We're going to look like fools. We already said on the radio we were filming. I know! But Charly is getting all worked up. Charly! Hey Charly! What? Shit man, don't leave us like this. Man, I bust my ass to be able to be here, to do my part, I've got a shitload of responsibilities, and you're still giving me shit? I have to see my son, man I have work. You have your parents man, they're always there. I don't! I have nothing! And I still get it done. And you're breaking my balls? Yeah bro, because we all have our problems. I have a fucked up situation at home, but here I am, you know? The music comes first for me. What are you saying? You want me to put music ahead of my son? I can't man, I won't. I know man, nobody is asking you to do that. You are! Guys, just tell me, are we filming this video or not? because if we aren't, I'm out and don't bother asking me again. I don't know. - What's up guys! - Hey! What's up! Let's start filming some parts of the video, okay? Wait a sec. We need to check the shots with Rata, C'mon man, is Rata directing or you? Relax Charly, we're doing this together, as always. Gigio are you ready or not? Ready Rata? Rolling! Let's go Martin! Now!

A Niko graffiti welcomes you to Quilicura, I'm flying through this grey cloud, The people in this city don't know how to be happy, Screaming and fighting all the time, Noise and car horns are their soundtrack, Okay, so where do I stand? Give him the gun. We were thinking over there. But be careful with that shit, It's loaded. But the safety's on. But he could switch the safety off. - what? It's loaded? - Yeah bro, yeah Yeah. - Our shit's the real deal, bro. - Be careful bro. Don't fuck with that shit. And if it goes off?

I'll do it. - Give me that shit. - Let's do it there. Ok, let's go. But be careful with that shit bro, You're holding it like a toy. It's a weapon. When I say "action" you're gonna point the gun at the camera, and start rapping, okay? Cool. And... Action. Ok. Easy there, Gigio. Slow down a bit. Don't make it look so lame. Ok. Do it Gigio, point it at me. Good. - Hey guys! - Watch out! - Good afternoon boys. - Good afternoon. What are you doing? filming a video. Got a permit for that? No. What kind of video?

You're disturbing the peace. And you're too many. - Wait, wait. - Hey guys! Hey. You should know people are always complaining that's why you ask for a permit, but you didn't, did you? Unfortunately.

I'm taking you to the hospital. Let's go. But are you ok? Are you hurt? My arm. Careful bro, get in. Girl, you have to be more careful. Hey man, you guys crossed me! Fuck. Shit, I'm sorry.

My name is Sol. My name is Martin. I'm Carlos, but everybody calls me Charly. Cool. Fuck Martin, I hope you didn't break anything. I don't think so. I feel good now. Dude, she just ran you over. How can you be alright? Don't make it a bigger deal than it is. Man, you just got hit by a car! I feel fine man. What are those guys doing over there? - Who? - Those guys? Throwing cats onto the electric cables, I guess. Yeah, they're killing cats. What? They’re trying to throw those cats on the electric cables. Or maybe thowing them on the train tracks. Are you kidding me? What the fuck? That shit is normal around here. It's not a big deal. They're always killing cats. What the fuck? Why are you turning around? Hey! You think you're superman? - Hey. - This girl is crazy. Sol! Sol! Fuck! - Hey Sol. - This girl is crazy Sol! Hey Sol. Fuck, man.

And what's wrong with you guys? Why the fuck do you have a gun? It's not mine. But you're carrying it! Fucking assholes! I went to visit Dani. What? What I said. That's why I didn't make it to the radio. Music is everything to me. The music… And my son. It's all good bro. It's ok. It's cool bro. I just wanted you to know. You know. I'm always here. I know bro. The video's fucked up anyway. - Maybe not. - Rata will get his camera back. And maybe save what's in it. Rata's in jail, Charly. He's probably pissed off. It's ok, you're okay. We should give him a name. Yeah. Like… Lucky or Luca. No man, we need a good name. Something cute, like him. Puppy. - No way. - That's so lame. - She said something cute. - Cute, not lame. Train. Train? - Do you like Train? - Do you like Train? Do you want to be named Train? Yeah? Train's a pretty name. It will also remind him of his past. His little brothers. Cats can't remember anything. Don't say that. I guess they don't have emotions and don't have a soul either. What do you know? I read something about them. Nowadays people believe whatever they read on Facebook, and think It's all true. I did see it on Facebook. But It's not like I believe everything I read. But you do believe whatever's on Facebook. So what? How come you believe in UFO's? No, I don´t. And that crap with the street lights? That's different. You've seen it happen. What about the street lights? - Nothing. - C'mon. Nothing man. It's just that... When I walk under a street light, it shuts off. Really? Cool. Go try to turn that one off. - No. - Again? No, no. - Come on! - It doesn't work like that. It's not like, whenever I want to, you know? It's like... when I'm feeling pissed off. It's like an energy thing. Yeah right, Jodorowski! Come on, don't mess around I just want to see it. Come on. Turn off that light so we can watch it happen. Ok, but if it doesn't work, don't make fun of me. Fraud! You're so full of shit. I told you. I've never heard of anyone turning off street lights like that. It's just some shit that happens. But it's weird, It only works when I'm messed up. Let me hold Train. Do you want to go home? Hey guys. My mom must be worried by now. I'm gonna go home. I don't want to go home, man. Let me hold Train.
