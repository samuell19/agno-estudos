Okay, thanks. Yeah, so how's Jasmine and Asia? - Oh, they're great. - And the twins? - As feisty as ever. Tell me this, of all the places we could of met why here? - Well um, I think there's a geometro on level seven that you might be interested in. Go check it out. - Okay. - That ones on the house. - You're awesome, you are great. - I know. - Thank you. - All right good luck, be careful. - Thanks. - All right, bye. - See you. (soft tense hip hop) - I have a gun and I suggest you stay right where you are. - Please, don't shoot. - Don't give me a reason to. Are you Lee Nguyen? - Yes. - Do you have a son named Jojo Nguyen? - The boy is not my son. - That's what they all say. - Look, I even take a DNA test to prove its not my son. She's lying. (low tense eerie music) - If the kids yours, I'm coming back after you. (soft instrumental music) - Looks like you had a rough morning. - Rough aint even the half of it. You know that Nguyen case I've been working on? When I approached him for payment he said the kid wasn't his. - Its not? - No. He's even willing to take a DNA test to prove it. - Do you think he's telling the truth? - I don't know what to think anymore. This is, like its become a circus. I'm so tired of it. - I know what you mean but, what else can we do? - Been thinking about that. (knocking) (soft instrumental music) (low tense music) - Has your son's father ever paid child support? - No. - Does he have a job? - He's a rapper. - A rapper? Are you serious? - Yeah. - So, what does he expect you to do in the meantime? - Clearly he doesn't care. - Look, since he has no legal place of employment the only other alternative you have is putting him in jail. - And what good is that gonna do? I don't want to get him thrown in jail. - I know. We will get the paperwork started and we'll send it over to the attorney general's office so he can be served. - I'm taking the steps. (soft somber instrumental music) - Listen ladies, our hands are tied. We have 30 new cases this week alone and we've only been able to locate five people to collect child support payments. - Well I just have to deal with two of our clients parents attorneys because the parents don't want to change the child support arrangements because they are receiving welfare benefits. Look, I don't know what else we can do. - I know what we can do. We need to kick some asses around here and then maybe we can see some results. - Okay. - For real. - [Both] Give him a little bit of they own medicine. We down. (laughing) - Uh uh, that's not legal. - Legal? What's legal about not taking care of your kid? - Okay but we cannot break the law now? - Fuck the law. - Uh uh, I can't do that. Miles is an attorney. - Fuck him, too. - You are out of line. - Ladies, calm down. - Its like you're trying to jeopardize everything we've built. - No, I'm trying to do my job. - Oh okay. So you think running around Dallas whooping men's asses is the answer to our problems. - Its a start. - No. Its barely scratching the surface and its not gonna solve our problem. The only way to solve a problem is to get the root of it. Its sad to say but the root of our problem is the system itself. How many women come in here and practically forced to put their men on child support? (gargling) Then he end up 15 to 20,000 dollars behind. Now he locked up. Sometimes I feel like we destroy more families than we help. Look. I don't mind whooping some ass but that's not the business we're in. So you really want to kick some ass? Why don't you try focusing your energy on the one who spent the web and not the prey that's caught up in it. Yes? Ladies this is important, I have to take this. - Whatever. - Dang, you so mean. (soft R&B music) * Spread my wings * And follow me * I'll show you - Hey. - Hey, baby. - How you doing? - How are you? - I'm good. - Sorry I'm late. - Oh girl, you all right. You know I wait for you forever. - So sweet. - Can I get you guys something to drink? - Do you have sweet tea? Let me have one of those. - I'll have the same. - So how are things down at the office for you? - Baby. - [Waitress] You guys ready to order? - Just give us a second here. What were you saying? - This business is getting on my damn nerves. - I told you. I mean, I'm saying, I told you it was gonna be hell trying to catch some of those fools. - Its like, they know we're coming every time. - Are y'all ready? - Um, I'll have the usual. Chicken and salad. - Me, too. So, how are things at the mayor's office? - Things are good, things are good. I got a couple of things in the works and then once this election is over then we can go and start planning on settling down. - Excuse me? Settling what? Um. - Baby. - No, Miles, you know I'm not ready for that. - Why else you think I put all this time and effort in this relationship? - When were you gonna tell me? - Baby. I just did. - I mean I want, I got plans. I have this business to run and I don't have time for kids and babies right now, Miles. - Baby. That's why I'm telling you now. - Anyway, how is the mayor? (coughs) You okay? - Yeah. - Drink slowly, baby. (energetic hip hop music) - Yo, what up? - Did I catch you at a bad time? - Who's this? - I met you at the club a couple of days ago. After your performance. - Girl, do you know how many girls I met at the club that night? - I had on the short red dress? - Girl with the red dress. Oh yeah, now I remember. What's going on? - I was hoping I could spend some time with you. - Well I tell you what, that could happen. I live down here in the loft district. I'ma text you my info. Why don't you come on through? (soft tense music) (upbeat hip hop music) - What's up, Miles? - Detective. I need you to quickly fumigate our little pest problem. - What you talking bout? I got problems of my own. - Do you realize how important this election is for the mayor and how this little baby situation can ruin her chances of reelection? Do you realize how much I have invested in the situation? - What you trying to say? - What am I trying to say? - Yeah. - Detective, it would be a shame if a leak got out about the missing money from that Richard Dominguez drug lord bust from last week. You were the lead detective on that case, right? Hell of a situation. - By the way, Miles, how's Jasmine? - Son of a bitch. - Hey love, come on in. - Thank you. - So I make it you found the place aight. - Yeah, yeah. - Cool. Yeah sometimes people say I give bad directions, you know? - Its quite all right. - You see something you like? - Oh yeah, absolutely. Oh. What a handsome little boy. - Yeah, that's my little shorty. - Bet you take real good care of him, don't you? - Something like that. Can I get you something to drink? Thirsty? - Oh yeah, water please. - All right cool, be right back. - Can't believe this nigga got all this fly ass shit and aint paying child support. - Ice cold. - Thank you. - You so welcome. - Where's your bathroom? - Its right over there. - Thank you. - All right cool, its all clean and stuff so don't worry bout nothing. (somber piano music) Oh snap. Damn baby, I didn't see all that at the club. - You know you have a beautiful place. It pays to be a rapper. - Little something like that. Why don't you come over here, let me see what's under that trench coat. Fine little thing. Come on over. (low tense music) Its the goody cut, right there. - Uh uh. - Damn, you like it rough? - Yeah well I wouldn't want you to hurt yourself. - That actually might not be a bad thing. (low tense music) yo, what the? What the hell is going on here? (laughs) - What you mean what the hell is going on here? I want something from you. - What the hell do you want? - Money! - So you jacking a nigga? - Well you catch on pretty fast, don't ya? - Is this a joke? (gunshot) - Does that look like a joke? - Damn, baby, I'm just saying, though. - Yeah, what you just saying? - I'm just saying though. - If you say I'm just saying one more time I'ma blow your head off. Now, I want money and you're 20,000 dollars in the rear so for now, I'll just take half. Empty your wallet, give me your wallet. - 10,000-- - give me your wallet! - 10,000-- - Give me your wallet! - I don't have 10,000 dollars! I don't have 10,000 dollars in my wallet. - Yeah well I'll get whatever you got in your wallet. I'll take whatever I can get. You better stay right there, you better not move. - Its like that? - Yeah. Its like that. - Your ass is crazy for real. (clears throat) - Okay, look here. You're still about 15,000 dollars in the rear. So, here's what you're gonna do. You're gonna pay 1,000 dollars every month and 1,000 dollars you're gonna pay every month until you're caught up. - You're out your damn mind. - Uh uh. But you know what I want you to do? I want you to smile for the camera. Take a picture, take it. And if you say one word about this, I'ma blast your ass on YouTube. (soft piano music) (low tense dramatic music) - Excuse me, Cedric? - yeah? - Are you Cedric? - Yeah, that's me. - Listen, I hear you've been harassing the mayor and her daughter. - No, I have a son. - Listen, take this as a warning, okay? (somber piano music) - All right, so, what you're saying is that somebody broke in, held you at gunpoint and then beat you down. - Yeah officer, that's exactly what I'm saying. - Mr. Jenkins, this scene does not look like a forced entry. - What, y'all think I'm lying? - So uh, did you get a good look at the suspects? - Dude, for the last time it was like four guys with ski masks. I didn't get a good look at none of them. - Yo, Arliss, come take a look at this. Yo, Tyrone. - Yeah? - What kind of gun did you say he used again? - It was like a sawed off AK-47. - Okay. - When he pulled it out I almost peed a little bit. - It would make me pee, too, man. Hey, anything else comes up, man, just give us a call, all right? - I will do. I appreciate y'all concern. - Let's go. - All right, Tyrone. Just take a few deep breathes, splash some water on your face, settle down. Give us a holler if you hear anything. - Gee, thanks. - [Woman] Vote for child support. - Mayor Palinski, the polls seem to be in your favor. Do you think this due to your support for the child support (mumbles) project? - Yes, I feel this city knows how important children and education are to me and my administrations. - [Reporter] Will the citizens have an opportunity to ask you questions? - We are working with the attorney general and some private sectors trying to restore funds to single parents as well as the parents who are paying child support so we can legally have their (mumbles) and they can spend time with their children. This is why I believe this DNA project is vital to our project as well. - Mayor Palinski, you mentioned DNA test, testing as parents know who are seeking testing its very expensive. So how will people in low income areas be able to afford it? - I will challenge every clinic one day a week to open up its door for free DNA testing. This will be beneficial to single parent families and also aid and assist to help us to get child support collected. - Mayor, what role are you playing in playing they DI school district issues? - No questions for now. The mayor has a very tight schedule to keep. (soft reflective hip hop) (phone rings) - Hello? - Madison, I'll be at the park today around four o'clock. I want to see my son. - [Madison] I can't promise you anything. - Today, Madison. (soft reflective hip hop) - I just can't believe it. That's crazy. - Hey, what's going on in here? - Hey. - Hey, girl. - Did you hear what happened to Tyrone Jenkins? - Uh, no. - [Both] He was beaten and robbed last night at his place. - Girl, they whooped his ass. (upbeat church music) - Uh, Tyrone. Oh. Oh that Tyrone, yeah. - The polls look good. The city loves you and I smell a victory. - For now, anyway. - I told you not to worry. Its taken care of. - Do you know what my white conservative friends are gonna do when they find out that I have a grand baby? You know I don't have anything against blacks. I just don't understand how she got herself pregnant by... What was she thinking? - That's just it, sweetheart, she wasn't thinking. - How could I have been so stupid? - Oh come now. You're not being stupid. You're simply looking out for the future of your family and this city. - If anything happens the bar is coming after you. - I'm not planning on this not working. So just relax. Everything will be fine. (upbeat hip hop music) * How could you do this to me * I thought we had something * I never knew this could be * Breaking up our family * How could you do this to me * How could you do this * I thought we had something * I never knew this could be - Everybody's already gone for the day, for lunch, are you gonna get something? - No. - You're not going to lunch? - No. - Nicole, is there something you want to tell me? - Like what? (somber reflective music) (sniffles) (crying) This system is so screwed up. - Nicole, please don't make this about your stepfather. - Don't ever mention his name to me again. - Look, I understand how you feel but we have to play by the rules. - What rules? What rules protected me from getting molested by my stepfather, Jasmine? - I know. - No. No. It was shelters and it was sleeping in cars, being hungry, hand me down clothes. - That's the reason why we started this agency but if we don't do things the right way, we won't be able to help anyone. - We've been doing this three, four years the right way and it still takes forever to get things done. (somber reflective music) Here we are in the middle of a conversation and you're worried about a date with Miles. - He's a good man, Nicole. - I didn't say he wasn't a good man. I'm sure he is one of the good guys. I mean he works hard, believes in god, doesn't stray, the whole knight in shining armor bit. - I'll talk to you later. (somber reflective music) - Yeah this Tyrone Jenkins case doesn't make sense. - Yeah well, we know that he definitely did get jacked by somebody with a sawed off AK. - Sawed off AK-47. You hear that fool? (laughing) - Yeah that's the best one I've heard so far. (laughs) - Yeah, talk to me. Okay. Hey man, good work, man. All right, thanks. Tyrone Bernard Jenkins has a warrant out for his arrest. - Really, what for? - Failure to pay child support. (phone rings) (child laughs) - Hell is the receptionist? Can I help you? - I noticed the help wanted sign outside. - Yes, the mayor is having a DNA drive so we are gonna need a bunch of help around here. - Cool. - Okay, so are you used to being around the child support environment? - No. But I worked with the save and rescue unit while serving in Iraq. - Okay. All right okay, Nicole, could you come here for a second? She gonna help you out when she get here. So, this young lady is looking for a job and she just got back from Iraq. - Oh part of that Bush bullshit? - Glad to be home. Got tired of seeing my people killed. - Oh, okay. - Okay, well come on back to my desk. Y'all in or what? - Jasmine is gonna kick our ass. - She'll be aight. But we're not gonna kill anybody. Okay? I said okay? - Aww look at her now. I'm so glad you calmed down cause you were really starting to scare me. Did you hear that, soldier. We are not gonna kill any civilians. - Yes, ma'am. - Oh she's so cute. - Soldier. (laughing) (tense music) (heart beating) (tense dramatic music) (laughs) - You got kids. (clears throat) (camera clicks) (funky bass line) - Hold that for you. - Thank you. Thank you, darling. - What's the status? - Well, Mr. Santiago says his check is in the mail. - In the mail? - Yes, yes, its in the mail. - Thank you. - How much you send? How much? How much? - You guys mind? She asked you a simple question. How much have you supposedly sent? - Half, half! - Appreciate you. - Half? Now what are your children supposed to do with half? - Well, you know what since he made an effort to pay half, how bout I just blow off half? (laughs) - No, no. (speaks Spanish) - Yeah, you've been doing that for a long time, now. You've been spending partial payments in the mail for the last six months. - That's cause the stupid economy and the stupid attorney general take my passport over his stupid child support stuff and now I can't even travel to make money. Stupid, stupid, stupid! - Hello? Hello? - Oh, I'm sorry. How can I help you? - I heard your commercial on the radio about the free DNA testing. - Okay, and what's your name? - Cedric Evans. - Okay, are you currently paying child support? - No. - Okay, fill out the papers in the folder and we'll be with you in just one moment. - All right, thank you. - Hi, I was checking to see if my test results were in yet. - And your name? - Shelly Dominguez. - Shelly Dominguez, hold on just a second. - So how many women you say robbed you again? - Tres, senor and one lady was asking me about my child support payments. - Child support? - Si. I told her it was in the mail. The next thing I remember, the door busting open and two of her puntas barge in and attack me. - Wasn't quite the fantasy you were looking for, was it? (laughs) - Hey, Brown, take a look at this. - Yeah? - Look what we have. - Yeah, yeah, that's definitely a woman's scarf all right. - Huh. So now there are three deranged women running loose robbing men. - Yeah. - Of child support checks. - You thinking what I'm thinking? - Yeah, I think its time to give sarge a call. - Hey, hey. We'll be back, okay? - Si. - Don't go nowhere. Comprende? - Si. - Aight. And put on some clothes, man. Let's get a bag for that, all right? - Hey. - Hey. - You okay? - Yeah. - Promise? - Yeah. I saw the free DNA testing sign outside the window. The place should be flooded today. - Did you know that over 106 billion dollars is owed in child support? - You know, Jasmine just imagined how that money could be used for the children who need shelter and their medical expenses. - I know and food, I know. - Not to mention food and clothing. - Yes? - [Receptionist] Yes, I have a young man out here who's trying to put himself on child support. - Send him in. - Probably looking for his daddy. - Or he probably is the daddy. - I guess we'll find out. - We shall. - Oh, have a seat. This is my partner, Nicole. She helps me run the agency. (soft somber music) - Are you looking for your father? - No ma'am, I want rights to see my son. - Are you paying child support. - No, I mean I want to but she won't take anything from me. - She who? - His grandmother. - Did you do anything to the kid to make her act like that? - No, she just doesn't like me because I'm black. - Oh. Okay. So its okay for you to sleep with her daughter but its not okay for you to have a kid by her? - Nicole. - Sorry. Sorry. - Before we get started, do you have a job? - Yes, I bus tables at Freddie's Chicken Shack at night and during the daytime I'm a full time student. - Okay. How much are you bringing home? - 150 every week. - Okay that's 600 dollar a month and 120 every month in child support. Can you handle that? - Yes, ma'am. - Oh hold on now. - Okay. - Let's see.

(tense music) No matter how angry you want to be at the world or every single man in your life none of that emotional shit is gonna change what happened to you as a child. (tense music) - So now you want to go there, huh? - You're not a child anymore, Nicole and none of that stuff was your fault but you're a grown ass woman now and if you want to keep living in the past and making the present miserable, that's on you. - Yeah you know what? I do have a few things I want to get off my chest. - Oh well shit, you aint said nothing but a word. - [Both] Ohhh. (low tense classical music) - Doesn't look like a place (mumbling).

We offer that and many other services for men and woman to help get them back on their feet. - Have you collected some money from Mr. Jenkins or Mr. Santiago? - I'm sorry, that's confidential information. - Not when there's crime involved. - Exactly. - What are you implying? (somber music) - Well we believe your agency is doing a little bit more than just collecting money for your clients. - Look, we run a legal, law abiding agency here. If there are any crimes being committed its against innocent children being neglected by their dead beat parents. (tense music) Gentlemen, if you wouldn't mind. I believe this meetings over. - Really? Let's go. You sure you okay cause-- - I'm positive. Y'all have a good day. - Girl, I'm so stressed out. I mean I don't know what to do.

Okay, so what is it you need to talk to me about so fast? - Two detectives showed up at my door asking me questions about Mr. Santiago. - Well what did you tell them? - I didn't tell em anything. - So what makes them think you're involved? (clears throat) - [Jasmine] Am I interrupting something? - What happened to you? - No. Come on in. - Two detectives came by today questioning the integrity of our establishment. I don't know what's going on but y'all better cut it out or I'm gonna shut down the agency. - You can't do that. - Watch me.

These papers just came proving that Cedric is the father of your child. (tense music) - I don't understand. - Understand this. You are destroying my career. - Your career? Mom, I love Cedric and this is his child. You're ruining my life. - Love? You are 17 years old. You know nothing about love. - Nothing? I know I don't love being a prisoner in my own house. I don't love not being able to take my child out. And you know what? I don't love this kind of life. - Well nobody told you to go sleep with a black man! - So its just okay for you? (tense music) - Look at me. If I ever catch you with that boy again I will make sure you never see him or that baby again. You got that? (tense music) Meet me in 15 minutes. - She's your child. - I'm doing everything I can! - [Woman] You are not doing anything. I can't do this by myself. - [Man] I send you everything I can. - [Woman] Oh you didn't even show up to court. - [Man] Look, you sent this woman up to my room. This crazy woman-- - what else was I supposed to do? - What do you want me to do? - [Woman] You're hurting me, stop it. (banging) Stop it. Stop, stop. Stop it. Stop.

(somber music) - I didn't mean to make you upset ma'am, I just thought you should know. - You sure that its him? - Yeah. Madison didn't really like him that much. She felt like he was just using her mom. - I am calling this press conference today to announce that I am dropping out of the race for the mayor of this fine city. - Mayor, can you tell us why you're dropping out now when the polls are in your favor? - This campaign has cost me the most precious thing in my life and I need time to heal and be a grandmother to my grandson. - So what does the future hold for you? - At this moment I am very uncertain about my future in politics. - Tom, you heard that directly from Mayor Palinski.
