THE SECTIONS THAT WERE CUT CANNOT BE LOCATED. THE LOST ANGEL A DAY IN THE LIFE OF ERNST BARLACH ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL: THE TERRIBLE YEAR BY FRANZ FÜHMANN. WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY RALF KIRSTEN GERMANY MAGDEBURG MEMORIAL- REMOVED 1933 KIEL MEMORIAL- BROKEN OFF 1937 HAMBURG MEMORIAL- DESTROYED 1937 Yes, hello? Who is this? Who? No... No... Who... who are you? They... They've stolen the Angel. These Nazis! We've shut ourselves up here. We've tried to hide ourselves. Nobody dares visit us anymore. And if they do, only in secret. Nobody buys anything from you. What should we live on? We've forgotten how the outside world looks. But they... They don't forget us. When it occurs to them, they'll find us and hurt us. We should leave. What are you still waiting for? It can happen overnight, one decides "I don't want to go on." They say you're un-German! The victims of bad genes, creatures of a cultural Bolshevik. Make yourselves comfortable, it's just us here. The cultural Bolshevik, that's me. I'm doing just grand... no doubt about it, you doubter! - Those in Berlin - Nagel, Kollwitz... they're envious of my grand situation, here by the lake and forest. Yes, dreamers, we've run away, away from the literary babble, from the ladies' gossip and the academic chatter. Away from the bankers and stock brokers. Away from the programs and pre-formulated attitudes. Even here, a few requests came every week, from the Left or Right, wanting me to participate. I never did. But Kollwitz did. Did I actually like her, this woman? More than I thought. Absolutely unintentionally her face came into my Angel. Now I envy Kollwitz. She belongs somewhere. She belongs to the Left. That she is among the persecuted gives courage to thousands. Even her silence is needed. No one needs Barlach anymore. You shouldn't go into the city today. Maybe tomorrow. Do you still have neighbors or friends? Or acquaintances in the house across the way? Does he lament the absence of the Angel, this German factory owner at his German-Christian wedding? How the bride holds his arm. He owns everything: his wife, the part in his hair, his war, his dead... all his. What is left of the world for me if everything is his? Do they see it? They see it. That you must memorize, Barlach. They celebrate the fall of my Angel. No, I never belonged to the Right. They were my instinctive enemies. Have they ever actually stood before the Angel and listened? Until they heard it? The silent scream? They have heard nothing. As protector of the holy hearth in your husband's house, always happily performing your duties, as keeper of domestic peace, shall you also become a true, believing German Christian. Because motherhood means something great and holy to your German nation... ...among the soldiers of the Great War. You will find it among the ranks of the fighters who follow our Führer. Through them, may you also find your way to the great, eternal Führer who spilled his blood for us. How grand it would be if every German home became a nursery for real German-Christian virtues. Is there anything greater for a young couple? Anything greater than the calling to help in creating the joyful and bright future of your entire nation? Admittedly, it is a difficult task. And as young people, you are right to look around for role models you can follow. Thus will the new German-Christian church grow out of a healthy nationhood, in which all fellow Germans graciously pray to their Lord God. Then will the saying apply to more than you alone: Your people are my people... Your God... Do you not understand that the fall of the Angel was the end of peace? You understand it very well. They are only a few meters away from me. Yet I cannot reach them. Did none of them keep watch with the Angel? Did they all hide away? Convulsively they cling to the illusion of peace. What am I to them? A ghost? A madman? A dowser? Someone to lock up in an asylum, if he had not already locked himself away on his Heidberg. It's warm here. Life is here. Time for having children, time for love and time to grow old. Who needs a piece of silent bronze that screams? Their Führer provides them with "Strength Through Joy." Strength for war, strength for death. Why should anyone worry, when the Nazis take care of everything? There are lunatics, Barlach, who kill themselves by fearing for their lives. Who can bear to freeze to death? Can't you burrow under life to where it's warm? Nonsense, Barlach, if you're cold have some lilac tea. I've already tried to burrow under once. Back then, in 1914. I didn't want to be Barlach anymore, just German. I wanted to be one with everyone in Germany. Take a look at them, Klaus. Those are our enemies. Is that one especially evil? Our enemies are evil. Is that one very evil? Look at him, Klaus, closely. How does he look? Like a bear. But the bear in "Snow White and Rose Red" is good. Because there's a prince within him. In the enemy, there dwells a soul: it is small and evil and hates us. Do Germans have a bigger soul? Yes, that's why they hate us. Are all Germans good? In times of peace, no; but in times of war, yes. In peacetime everyone counts their money and thinks of food. But in wartime they become heroes and think of the fatherland. War is good. War makes people good. What did my son remember? The loud words of my enthusiasm for war? Or the silent wrath of my sculptures against the war? What's the use of art when an inhuman word exacts more influence than a human image? The German nation. Is that what my hands worked for, in wood and bronze? Or is it that, in the name of which they put people into camps and torture and beat them? To whom does the German nation belong? To me? Or the Nazis? I'm an émigré in my own land. Oh, Mrs. Need. Back then she sat as a model for me and now she comes again. She had to come. No, no, I haven't gone hungry yet. I even still have enough to go to a mountain spa. These Brownshirts know exactly how to wear you out. Who? The woman who spoke that way? She's gone. She was a Jew... she's long gone. You always liked being alone. But I wasn't lonely. Now I am. I'm sick of this! I want peace. It must be good to be dead. A pistol to the temple... then peace. Nothing but peace. I only want peace. I don't need a pistol anymore. My heart will do it on its own. He's not educated, but knows everything. Why does he help me? Is he not one of them? No, he's one like me. Here he stands and here he grew out of the earth. Not the Nazis. They grew in Munich beer halls, fattened on Krupp's money. How he encloses himself in his coat against those who want to own him, like everything else. Learn his face by heart, Barlach. You must remember him. What? Am I creating sculptures in my head again? Nobody needs my art anymore. No, just him. Just a couple more, not many. I showed them... and I will show them again... the meaning of My People. This Laughing Old Lady... she still needs to be finished. Get ready! It's got to be a laugh that'll make the laughter of Goebbels and Rosenberg vanish. My heart must persevere. I'm going for treatment, no matter where I get the money. The gentleman is ill. No offense, sir, if you'll make do with the cart. It's a good harvest. But who is bringing it in? People who work hard for a living. Others work too. But don't fight. Wits are important too. You need your head. Yes, you need to keep your head. Germany, awake! Germany, awake! Say it! Say it! Germany, awake! Pardon me that I didn't knock. You stand there and feel like a hero. And you? You cower up there, two meters above the ground, and don't give a damn about what happens outside. Can your art undo the death of a single person? One who fell for a just cause? It can perpetuate its memory. It can save the death from oblivion. Art can keep desire alive. That's priestly babble, keep desire alive, save death from oblivion. Why don't you help us live? Men have been crippled for generations. But people don't want to be, otherwise our lives would make no sense. You work too. The others, your enemies, want an art to digest and edify. But... But art, art is a matter of deepest humanity. A test for the strength of the alloy of spirit and soul. To improve the quality of my art, that's my duty. Others can do politics much better than I. And when the others are the Nazis? And-the Angel? The Angel was intended for all those who fell in the war. People are dying again, every day, thrashed, tortured. I know. The war has already begun. The Angel was in their way. They're rehearsing for the next war. My Angel was in the Nazis' way. Of all people, a Communist tells me this. So it wasn't just priestly babble. What did I expect? Why is my stomach turning somersaults? Did I want to be the Nazis' Barlach? No, definitely not. Did I want to make art for hardliners and Nazi youth? Art for bankers and stock brokers? I wanted to make art that the most noble spirits among cooks and coachmen could appreciate. Are my people perhaps the people of the Communists? Am I the Communists' Barlach? Does my art have a knowledge of people they can use? I don't know. Maybe my sculptures know more than I do. Will the war hold off until these boys are men? Hardly. These children should survive. They should renew the world and, if possible, improve it. Hopefully they'll act more radically than we did. The Nazi storm has driven me far to the Left. Who would have thought it would drive me so far? ON THE NIGHT OF 23 AUGUST 1937 UNKNOWN CULPRITS BROKE INTO THE GÜSTROW CATHEDRAL AND TOOK THE PEACE ANGEL. ONE YEAR LATER ERNST BARLACH DIED. THE ANGEL WAS NEVER FOUND. AFTER THE SECOND WORLD WAR A CAST WAS MADE. THE PEACE ANGEL HAS NOW RETURNED TO THE GÜSTROW CATHEDRAL.
