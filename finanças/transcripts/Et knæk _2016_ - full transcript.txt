Okay... One honk. Only one. And only if you see something suspicious, Okay? In that case, drive to the byroad Understand Nalle? Yes One honk if somebody comes. I get it. Hand it over! Nobody can trace that old shit anyway. Hey, Frank... Frank! Gitte? I need... I need my spacer set. The red one with Spacer written on it. It's in the car. - Red? - Yes. Good evening. Are you Mona Dalgaard? Yes. I am Mona. Are you home alone? We are sorry to bother you at this hour, but... It's about Jonas Dalgaard. Your son... He was in a car crash on the highroad... That must have been my husband waking up It appears that he lost control of the car and crashed into a tree at 40 miles per hour - They have tried to contact you from the hospital - Okay... Well ... Then we'd better get going... ...the two of us, right? What? To the hospital... We'll give you a ride. - No, no... - No, don't worry about that It's no problem. It's why we're here In our experience it is a bad idea to drive in your state of mind The doctor is ready to speak to you soon. If you need anything, let me know. Fuck... He can't be older than 20... Shh, Frank! We need to be serious. We have to find out what to do. We?! I have nothing to do with this. This is all you. - Where would you be if it wasn't for me? - I wouldn't be here, that's for sure! - No, you would be in jail again. - Shut up! Shh! - I don't want to do this. Let's get out of here - Frank, wait! - What is it? - Stay! The doctor will be here any minute! They think, that we're his parents... If we try to leave, it will look really suspicious. Pull yourself together! We need to reach Nalle, so we can get out of here. - Do I ... press zero to make an outgoing call? - Yes Excuse me, do you know what time it is? No. "Hello. You have reached Nalle's voice mail. Please leave a message." God damnit, Nalle! Mona? Mona Dalgaard? The doctor is ready to speak with you. - "Hello! You've reached Nalles voice mail"... - Come on, man - So if you and Jacob will follow me... - Yes... Nalle, where are you? - It's for us... - The doctor is waiting for you. Follow me, please I'm sorry, but I have to be certain that you understand what I am saying. Well ... How can he be braindead? The boy isn't more than 18 or 19 years old, he has his whole life ahead of him There must be something you can do... The brain haemorrhages were too severe, there is no activity in his brain anymore Jonas is only breathing because of the respirator That can't be right! No! Damn it, you can't just give up! I understand that this is difficult news, and I wish I could tell you something else We will do everything we can to help you through this We don't want your help! I think we need some time to process all of this... Yes, of course. When you are ready, we will turn off the respirator. We only need your signature. Then we'll take care of everything else. "Hello. You have reached Nalle's voice mail. Please leave a message." Goddamn it, Nalle, pick up your fucking phone You're the most annoying fucking person... Pick up your fucking phone! Hi mom. I'm sorry for calling in the middle of the night. Don't hang up, don't hang up! Mom? Listen, you need to get in the car and drive to the hospital. You have to pick me up Mom? Mom!? Mom, don't ... What are you doing? Frank! - What? - Let go! It's not your son! There's a dead boy in front of you, man! And you don't give a damn! Shut up! You would rob your own mother, and then you turn into jelly for some guy you don't even know! It's Nalle Is everything alright? We just need to... Yeah... Listen, Nalle. I don't care if the horn didn't work or how long you waited. Just come and get us right now! Nalle! - He's coming - Okay Yeah Now we can go and sign those papers, and then we can leave. What? I said, Nalle is on his way, so now we'll go and sign the papers and then we can leave - But, what ... - Sign it, so they can turn of the respirator What the hell are you talking about? That's what they want us to do. Are you insane!? Are you going to kill him? You don't even know him. Frank ... He is already dead. His brain doesn't function, he's a fucking vegetable - There's nothing in there - No Frank, don't you get that this is our only chance to get out of here! No, damn it, no it's not our decision to make, Gitte. Are you crazy!? We can't do it. We can't do it. I won't do it. - You won't do it? - No. Fine. Fine. Then we're turning ourselves in. ... What? We're turning ourselves in. - What was the name of your contact person? - What are you talking about? What are you doing? Stop that right now. Let go. Let go of the fucking phone! Let go! Jacob, it's okay to be angry, but it doesn't change the fact that Jonas is dead. You are about to face a very difficult time. But ... You seem incredibly strong. I hope and believe that you will manage. - And you you've said properly goodbye? - Yes No. - She hasn't - Yes, I have No. You haven't. Not properly. I've said my goodbyes! You're going to regret it someday, if you don't do it now. That's okay. I'm not going down there again. I think it's a really good idea if you finish this. Do you know what, I will come with you. That's a good idea I actually went to check if you were still there, in the house, and then I saw ... Well I found some jewelry I'm not kidding. See for yourselves. Super real They were real. Just shut up.
