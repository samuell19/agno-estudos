It became a Liberty Port -- San Fransisco did -- we have all Armed Services here -- and they got liberty, and so they went to the nightclubs. So, it was wonderful for business and for show business particularly. Then when you come to having something unusual like Forbidden City with Chinese entertainment -- which they've never seen. I mean, they came from the Middle West -- they'd never even seen a Chinese let alone a Chinese performer. -There had not been a Chinese nightclub in America until that time. I was first to build a Chinese bar in San Fransisco and then I was the first to build a Chinese night club -- not only in San Fransisco but in all of America. ♪swing music♪ [applause] -Forbidden City was a curiosity, a novelty, it was exotic, it was... universally well-known. -Quite a scandalous place to be going because you had the showgirls who were only partly dressed with skimpy costumes and so on.

If your father was a grocer, when he passes away he expects you to keep running the grocery store...you follow in your father's footsteps.

If they give you a chance to prove yourself...then you're fine... but you have to be given that chance. -Good evening friends, I am Charlie Low, your host at Forbidden City in San Fransisco. You have just met Mai Tai Sing and Tony Wing, two young people from the all-star Chinese review here at the nation's most unusual and outstanding oriental nightclub. -[laughs] Always trying to be the fashion nice guy. San Fransisco -- and other states as well, other cities as well -- have not seen a Chinese nightclub with an all Chinese floor show, and the time was ripe for something like that. I had a lot of criticism about it because Chinese will say, "Chinese people don't drink hard liquor," and they were totally wrong. We catered mostly to white trade. The old-fashioned Chinese in Chinatown have no foresight...satisfied in their little business...run it for maybe 30/40 years, but I'm a little different. Came from Nevada at a young age... I had vision, different ideas and thoughts in the back of my head... I knew I would have a lot of trouble, a lot of hard work in recruiting a good Chinese floor show, but I was quite lucky. -When the call came for girls to join a chorus lines, the girls form out of town applied. The Chinese families in San Fransisco looked down on such things, and the girls there didn't apply so we ere the only game in town. -As I said, we weren't very experienced dancers, you know, we were just mediocre dancers, but to the public we were cute. [laughs] We got away with murder to tell you the truth. -Oh yes, we did have a lot of fun with the girls. -We did indeed! -Because all our lives we had had real dancers... at the Moxie Theater and the Warfield. We had trained dancers and then to come into the Forbidden City and these darling Chinese girls that tried. -[Stan] They tried so hard. -[Pat] They really tried. See Charlie wanted us to do the precision like things because he had seen the shows at the Warfield Theater and we had a 16 line and everybody loved all the tiller work. So that's what we were trying to do. We were trying to do what we have always done to Charlie. Well, that was a thing. -Mm-hm. -And then the drummer... They had to do the down beat on the hop and the kick is on the upbeat, well they had never heard of an upbeat and a down beat. -[laughs] So I had to teach them. I had to teach the drummer had to catch the kick at the top of the beat. Various things like this... -But it was fun. -Very few people understand [laughs] this is what goes to make part of the show. ♪jazzy swing music♪ -I was using my mother's maiden name -- I was using Tony Costa -- and then when I went to work there Charlie says that he had to change my name to a Chinese name 'cause he says, "After all," he says, "We're advertising all-oriental review -- Chinese review," and I says, "Can I be a Wong?" And he says, "No, you got to be a Wing. There's too many Wongs in this show now, Gladys Wong..." He's naming all the Wongs. He says, "I have to have a different name."

Then came the idea with Mr Steel -- the PR man -- that suggested the idea of the Chinese bubble dancer... and then Charlie Low bought that idea. -Oh, yes! Chinese Sally Rand, very popular. She was a coed in UC Berkley -- a UC coed -- and she was a junior over there. She was born and raised in Inverness, California -- just over in Marin County -- and she was young and beautiful. -The poor girl never danced. She walked around for three choruses -- which is a long time in music -- holding a bubble or holding a pair of fans, and people were laughing and hysterical at her because it's a very long time. Only thing when it comes to turns, she would lose her balance -- it was hard with two 25 pound fans -- and she would fall on the tables and put her finger on people's chow mien and say, "Excuse me, is this okay?" "Help yourself." So Charlie said to me -- he called everybody Susie -- "Susie, you got to stop that. She's falling all over the table." "She'll learn." -When I first performed I think I was numb. [laughs] I think I was scared silly too...because I had never done anything like that before. [laughs] I knew if I wanted to get ahead I had to attract enough attention to get publicity. So I purposely, I think, did a lot of things that I normally would not have done. -They used the line "is it true what they say about Chinese girls?" There was an old standard joke that had gone around for years and years about their sex being different than caucasian gal, you see. So a lot of people...I really think they kind of believe it. They say, "We'll see for ourselves." [coughs] "We'll come up and see this girl and see if she's any different than anybody else." [laughs] That's the way it all got started. -They would all laugh. I was always being ripped by friends and other people, and I always took it good-naturedly -- I didn't get annoyed at it -- and I'd play along with it. They say, "Is it true what they say about Chinese girls?" And I say, "Oh, sure. Didn't you know?" [laughs] It's just like eating corn on the cob. [laughs] -And from that day on they were all the way out to the street, the people just came in there by the hundreds. So that was how the place got started. If it wouldn't have been for that idea I think we would have probably gone out of business entirely. -And of course night clubbing was the thing. There were several very good clubs in town and they were all patronized by the servicemen, but I think they came to the Forbidden City because we were different. The Chinese line was a novelty and the Chinese girls, I guess, were looked upon as being exotic and mysterious and... So business picked up and we started a boom. ♪sustained drum roll♪ [applause] ♪cheerful brass music♪ Cute little Chinese dolls.
