SONG: I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. [music playing] Coming at me from all sides, trying to give me some strong advice. Trying to get me for a long night. I get the feeling that they're trying to turn me to ice. I let them treat me like a big man. I let them treat me like they're all grown up. I don't know nothing but a cool jam. I don't know why they're always trying to make such a fuss. Cool party. What do they want from me? I wanna be anything you want me to be. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I kept it hidden for a long time. I didn't want them to get all shook up. They thought that everything was real fine. They knew that I was almost ready to cut. I let them buy me with the small talk. I let them buy me with a bad routine. I told them they were all talk. And then I noticed that they all began to be. Cool party. Where do they come from? What are their names? What are their games? I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Great, Elliot! [applause] Thank you, Elliot Sobers, for Leonard High's own rock video. The teaching staff and I want you to know how proud we are of all of you. You've been prepared in these four years to go out into the world as young adults and face the future. Good luck to you. [applause] And now our King and Queen of the prom, Keith Oliver and Christine Spencer. Will you please have a spotlight over here, please? SONG: We are the music makers. We are the shape of the things to come. We are the music makers. We take the moment to write. We are the music makers. Sorry! Debbie! Debbie! [whistling] Nina. SONG: I don't know what to do. Singin' with the groove again. 'Cause once you get down, you have to say, and I don't want you messing with anything. But I say, Mama, you don't understand. There's power in the songs we sing. And we're not gonna rest until we do our best to hang with our destiny. We are the music makers. We are the dreamers of dreams. We are the music makers. I can't believe your father's giving us the island estate. Yeah, one fun filled weekend of swimming, fishing, sex, more sex? Oh, yeah, sure, for you and Chrissie. Robin looks like a reject from a punk band. Well, at least she puts out the first date. Who cares? Hah! Come here. Gross! Well, maybe you should go for Tina. Oh, yeah, sure. Cowboy finds out, it's the last thing I ever do. What a way to go. Yeah. Pass the canteen. Elliot, you never give up, do you? You guys seen Debbie anywhere? Just a couple of seconds ago. She was headed for Canada. Come on, you know I'm her dream date. Yeah, the girl must be blind. Come on, at least my date doesn't look like the bride of Frankenstein. Yeah, well, Robin puts out the first date. Kiss. Just look in the camera and smile. Where is your young man? Probably at some young Republicans convention. Where's Debbie? Seems she won't be coming. Shoot the picture. She's allergic to cats. Allergic to you is more like it. Come on, everybody. Car's waiting. Let's go. So now Debbie won't come. I might as well stay here in Seattle. I feel like I'm going on this trip as the chaperone, or a eunuch. Three beautiful girls. Well, two beautiful girls. Gary's date is punky, overly made up, rude, cruel. I have to have her. Did you bring your tennis racket? No, I brought my diaphragm. Hi, you guys. Kate, my sweet bunny Kate! Kiss me, Kate! Hah-hah. What's your sister doing here? My parents took off again, so I asked her if she wanted to come with. On our prom night? Look, nothing's gonna ruin our weekend. How you doing? Hey, Cowboy. Hey, Cowboy. How are you doing? Look, I know this isn't the way you normally spend your weekends, but since you're here, you might as well try to get along. You stay out of my way, we'll get along fine. Hey, hey, hey. Come on, guys. Come on, we're gonna have a great time. "Thanks for all the wonderful memories. Love, Chrissie." Memories? What about the future? Hm. That goes without saying. Well, why didn't you say it? We're having a little difficulty up here. I'm going to take her down and have a look. I don't think it's anything too serious, but it's a little rough out there, so if you'll fasten up your safety belts, I'll thank you. We're gonna land in the ocean. It's a seaplane. There's nothing to worry about. If George needs any help, Gary knows how to fly. I didn't know you knew how to fly. I-- I took a couple of lessons. The day he was supposed to solo, he never even showed. George knows what he's doing. OK, kids, I've flown through worse weather than this. So Keith, see that they're all strapped down for me, will you, please? [screaming] Do you read us, Laura 370. [screaming] Instrument failure. Possible mayday, possible mayday. Aren't we going down a little fast? I'm scared. Oh, we've got sea-- [screaming] Help! Let me out of here! Get out, everybody! Come on, get out! [screaming] Somebody help me get this thing off! [screaming] Mayday, mayday. This is Laura 370. Mayday. [screaming] I can't swim. Elliot, come on! No! Come on! Get up! We're gonna die, aren't we? No, we're not. Come on! No! [groaning] [sobbing] [screaming] Mayday. Come on, get some help! Keith, Keith, help, help! Help. Help! Elliot, Elliot! Elliot! [screaming] Keith, Katie! Help. Over here. Grab the pontoon. Keith! Keith! Katie! Keith! [screaming] George is gone. He couldn't get out. I tried to get him out, but he wouldn't get out. [sobbing] Look, over there. I see something. - Over there. I see it. It's over there! Look, it's this way. I have a sneaking suspicion this is not the island. Of course it's not. There are hundreds of miles in this part of the ocean. We could be lost forever. Chrissie-- Don't you understand? Lost. You know what's really kind of awesome when you think about it? What's that? We all made it, and nobody got hurt. We're all alive. Except George. A little late for George, anyway. Hey, Cowboy, George was part of our family, all right? Keith, how long before you think they'll find us? I don't know. It depends whether or not they got George's mayday call. Yeah, right. So now what? We build a signal fire, look for, uh, some kind of food and water. Piss in the wind. Hey, look, Cowboy, I'm sorry this happened, but there's nothing I can do about it. Look, all we can do is try to get organized and make the best out of a bad situation. You got any better ideas, I'm willing to listen. Keith, where do we go to the bathroom? Just go in the ocean. I can't believe this is happening to me. Come on, let's get going. What do you think we're gonna find here? You know, Cowboy's not such a bad guy. Cowboy's an asshole. He and Chrissie went out last year. Nothing happened. She told me about it. I believe her. But he went around, telling all his biker buddies that he nailed her. Chrissie wouldn't lie to me. You know something, Cowboy? You know how sometimes somebody asks you who you would wanna be with if you were alone on an island? I never picked you. Ever. [music playing] Hey, everybody, it's a plane! Hey, over here! Down here! [screaming] Over here, over here! [screaming] Hey! [screaming] We're here! We're here, we're here! Gone. God, oh, God, if the rain hadn't put put out the signal fire, we would have been saved. I just know it. How are we gonna make it now? Come on, relax. We've only been here a day and we've already seen a plane. We'll get rescued. You know, at this rate, we're not gonna have any more food left. The last time you kissed a girl was probably the last time you played Spin the Bottle. huh, Elliot? From what I heard at school, the only thing you haven't kissed is a bottle. [blowing on bottle] Kiss her, Elliot. No! Go on, Robin, kiss him. ROBIN: No! OK, I think I can get into this. No! No! She's freaked out. I'm gonna play some more. OK, now. Oh! [laughter] I'm satisfied, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you very much. Did you come? No, I didn't come. Give him a kiss. Ahem. [laughter] [hooting] Hey, I don't know. This is-- I might-- yeah, anyway, I'm gonna play some more. No, no, no, no! Tina. - Take your glasses off. I don't need my glasses. I can see without them. - It's Tina's turn. It's Tina's turn. - I wanna play. It's my-- No, no, go ahead, Tina. You spin the bottle. - I wanna do it. - That's the rules. Because you play good, I'll sit here next to the little kid. Why don't you guys come around, like, so we can spin the bottle and-- you know, everybody in a circle. Come on. Come on. We don't need them. It's you and me. We're sure to win. OK, here we go. One, two, three. Woohoo! Whoa. Hey, hey! I'm not sure if I wanna win. Chrissie. [whistling] Go, Chrissie. This is real funny. Woo! Look at them smackeroo. Go, Gary. Woohoo. [laughter] [whistling] Oh, baby. That's hot. [whistling] Come on, Elliot, let's have some fun. Woohoo! Ride 'em, Cowboy! [laughter] You guys ever play strip spin the bottle? My oh my! Woohoo! Whoa. Hey, hey. Take it off, take it off! Woo! [laughter] Wow. Woo, woohoo! Woo, woohoo! Go, Chrissie, go! Shake it, baby, shake it! Woohoo! That's the spirit! Oh, yeah, woohoo! Take it off! Wet dream tonight. Elliot, you know better. Woohoo! Go, Robin, go! Woo! It's my turn. Let's go. Keith is really hot. Leave me alone. I'm wasted! I can't stand up. Come on. Come on, guys. Come on, guys. Keep it going, keep it going! Never believe she's still a virgin. Chrissie. Most experienced virgin I've ever seen. What's the matter, Cowboy? Can't get it up? He-- he got it up, but he couldn't do anything with it. Fuck you guys. I'll show you a fucking virgin. Do it, honey. There you go. Huh? Oooh-ooh. Now we'll see. Elliot: Come on, Prom queen, let's see 'em. Do it! [chuckling] All right. Not bad, not bad. Yeah! Ooh, yeah. Good catch. This should have been your yearbook picture. Whoa, what do we have here? - Gary! - Woohoo. Yeah! Gary, you're a big disappointment. [clapping] Only one thing left. It's over. Good night. Stop it. I mean it. What's the matter? I want it, but not here. Why not? I want it to be romantic. I wasn't being romantic. Yes. Yes, you were. Well? But I always dreamt of us two being alone together, taking a bath with wine, candles, all cozy. I don't wanna do it like this. Go to sleep. All right. All right. Go ahead, do it. Come off it, Tina, huh? I promise not to moan. Go ahead. Go to sleep. Cowboy? I wanna thank you for saving my life on the plane. It's no big deal. Not to you, maybe. I didn't mean it that way, Chrissie. I know. Why do you get all tough, put up a wall? A lot less to lose. What do you mean? You can't depend on anybody, Chrissie. When you lean on somebody, you go away, fall down. Like you did to me? I shouldn't have told anybody about us. Forget it. Now we're even. COWBOY: I guess they call that taking advantage, huh? I could have stopped you. . You love Tolliver? I think so. He's good for me. He ain't such a bad guy, for a rich kid. Hey, the hero's always supposed to get a kiss. Hah. Keith! Hey, man, we were just talking. I know damn well what you were doing. It's not what you think. I was just thanking him. Get inside, Chrissie. Back off, chump! Asshole! You asked for it, you got it, pal. Come on. Come on. CHRISSIE: Cowboy, Keith, stop it! Hey, come on, you guys, cool it! COWBOY: Get up. Come on, let's see what good your money does you now. Get up. Cowboy, stop! Get up! Come on! Shit. I don't need this shit! Cowboy. Cowboy, please don't go. Don't be mad at me. We weren't doing anything. It was an innocent kiss for saving my life. Nothing you do is innocent. You know I love you. Cowboy never meant anything to me. Don't lie to me, Chrissie. I'm not lying. - Yes, you are! - I'm not! - You are! - I'm not! Bullshit! You fucked him, and you know it! I didn't. You did it at the drive-in, and everybody knows it. I didn't. KEITH: Bullshit! We only made out. Hah. Where did he touch you? CHRISSIE: I can't remember. Well, remember! You fucked him. CHRISSIE: I love you, Keith. I love you! Cowboy never meant anything to me. He doesn't mean anything to me! Keith, come back. Oh, Keith. Hey, hey, hey! Hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. We'll be right back. Wait! Kate, Kate! Kate! Kate, there's a boat. Go tell the others! Wake up, wake up, there's a boat. There's a boat, everybody. Come on, wake up. A boat? A boat? Geez, too bad. One more day and I would've missed a dentist's appointment. Cowboy! Cowboy, there's a boat! Cowboy, we're going home! Cowboy! Leave the gun. Whoa. I can't wait to get in some clean clothes. All I want is a chili burger. Oh, we're so glad to see you. We got in this terrible plane accident. I'm glad you've saved us. Hi. I'm Keith Tolliver. They call me Gypsy. That's McDuff. Hello. Hi. Did you see anything here? There's nothing on this island except spam and vodka. Do you have anything to eat? We're starving. There's some hot soup. We're wondering if you'd be able to take us with you. Yeah, all aboard. Miss, come on. Keith, why didn't you tell them about Cowboy? Because I don't like the looks of either of them. And what makes you say that? It's just a feeling. At the last minute, I'm going to tell them we left somebody behind, a witness. I don't think we should do that to Cowboy. Let's just say I'm killing two birds with one stone. It serves him right. Come on. Some hot soup. Come on. Come on. That's great. Yeah. We really appreciate this. Thank you. Welcome. Welcome. Where the hell is Carlos and our money? We've got the guns. They'll show up. It'll be dark soon. They won't be coming in the dark. Yeah, it's gonna be a long, long night. Yeah. How about a little entertainment? You dirty pig. Let's go. Shh, quiet. Don't say anything. Party time. Listen, my father will give you anything you want. Just let us go, OK? A million dollars? [chuckling] Come to papa. Leave her alone! If she ain't no good, maybe I'll try you next. Tina! No. Bring him along. Sure, go with us. No, Elliot! No! You're next. They're gonna kill us, aren't they? [sobbing] What the hell are you-- No! No! Get your hands off her, you bastard! Stop it! [screaming] Help. Get your hands off her, you bastard! Stop it! [screaming] No! Help! [screaming] No! [screaming] Let me go! Get your hands off! Let me go! Get your hands off her! Let her go! Let me go! [glass shatters] Help. [gunshot] Got him! Gotcha. Everything's OK. Let's go. Help! Help, help! - Get us out of here. - Break the door down. Bust it down! Get out. The place is on fire. Let's go! Go, get out! Come on, get out of here. Come on, let's go! Go, Katie, I'm right behind you. Go, go, go! Come on, run. The thing's on fire. Cowboy came just in time. One more minute, and I hate to think about it. They must have had explosives on board. You know, Elliot, when you crashed through that door, you were like James Dean, Errol Flynn, and Superman all in one. Don't tease me. No. Hah. I must be dreaming. Now I think I died and went to heaven. You're still alive. In that case, I have one request. Yeah? What's that? I don't wanna die a virgin. I'll sleep on it. SONG: I held her close to me, because I know she breaks so easily. And then I told her. But I knew no matter how I try to console her, she'd just do the best she could. But there are times the best is no damn good. And no matter how you try to be kind, there's always still the part of you, you leave behind. When it falls apart, there's no easy way to break somebody's heart. I lied and told her she'd be fine, though we both knew it was just a lie. I had to do it, because I'd have said anything to help me get through it. And she reached out for my hand, and a simple touch was more than I could stand. And I had to turn away, because I knew all the hurt that she was feeling I was feeling, too. Because when it falls apart, there's no easy way to break somebody's heart. She could have gotten angry and made me feel like a guilty child, but I realized that never was her style. I wanted her to hurt me and not treat me like a friend. I wanted her to say there'd be someday I'd come crawling on my knees to ask her back again. But she acted like a lady till the end. Oh, what a lady. I thought that she'd rain down when she smiled at me and never made a sound. And I guess she understood in her way, because the silence told me everything she could not say. When it falls apart, well, there's just no easy way. There's just no easy way. There's no easy way to break somebody's heart. - Did you see it? - Yup. I didn't get a good look, though. Do you think it was the Coast Guard? I didn't see any markings. We need to be more careful this time, OK? Tolliver, you come with me. We'll check it out. Put out the fire, OK? I hope it's some kind of a rescue team. We all do. Holy shit. That's no rescue team. Ugh! I've had it! Get these things off of me! Get off! Ugh. Let me help you. Never mind. I'll do it. Ugh! He's headed for the cabin. We have to warn the others. Call ahead and wait for me. I'll give you a chance to get back to them. See if you can get Gary to that plane. Look, if I don't make it back, you can have my Mercedes. I don't want that piece of shit. You, over there, stop, stop! [gunfire] [gunfire] We got trouble. Shoot anything that moves. [gunfire] Cowboy, what's going on? What happened? Hey, we heard shots. There's three men heavily armed. Keith's drawing them away from us right now. The rest of you guys, get into the woods. Make your way through the underbrush, down to that rocky beach. Gary, you're gonna have to get to the plane. What? There's nobody on it. It's right off the beach. You're gonna have to fly it. Cowboy, I don't think I can do that. All right, look, maybe I could taxi it. There may be a radio on board. We'll all meet you down there. What about Keith? That's where I'm headed. [gunfire] [whistling] [gunfire] Huh? [gunfire] Damn! [gunfire] Ugh! Keep on going! I have to go find Cowboy. He may need me. Elliot, be careful! Come on, get up. Get up! Ugh. Move it. Ugh. Come on. Ugh. [glass clinks] You drank my vodka. Big deal. [gunfire] Where the hell did you learn that? Don't be so surprised. I saw it in a John Wayne movie. Come on. I gotta get his gun. Come on, he's moving. Let's go! Keep going, Elliot! [gunfire] OK, look, this is where we'll split up. Now, move as quietly as possible and come down to the beach on the far side. I'll meet you there. Wait, I wanna go with you. No, you stay here! Come on, let's go. Come on. [gunfire] You know, I've never flown a plane like this before. What's the difference? It's the same thing, except it's on the water. You can do it, Gary. Gary, Gary! Gary, turn around! Gary! Quick, on the plane! Hi. Hi there! Hi there! Hello, hello! I'm lost. I'm all by myself. Can you help me? Can you help me? Come here. Come over here! [screaming] Help, Keith! [screaming] Keith! Shit. [gunfire] [gunfire] [gunfire] Stop, stop! Where's Gypsy and McDuff? In hell, I hope. Stop, leave me alone. Keith, help! Stop! Wait! [screaming] Let go! Tina, come on! Help, help! Son of a bitch! Get off! Get him! Pull his hair! Kill him. Come on! Scratch his eyes out! Get off! Ugh! I got the gun! Freeze! Give me the gun, little girl. And no one will get hurt. Don't fuck with me. Blow him away! [gunfire] [screaming] Get out of here. Gary! Come on, go ahead. Come on. Come on, you can make it. Over this way. Stop. [screaming] COWBOY: Shit. Give me your hand. Only if you promise to remain faithful. [gunfire] [gunfire] Oh, god. Come on. Come on, guys! Get inside, you guys. Come on. [gunfire] Paddle harder, you guys! [gunfire] Paddle harder! Row. Come on, row, guys, row! [gunfire] Paddle, come on, guys! Give me your hand. [gunfire] Hurry up, get inside. Get in, move faster! [gunfire] Quick, come on. Quick, close the door. [gunfire] Come on, Gary, take it up. You can fly it. You can do it. [gunfire] Take it up, Gary. Fly it! Come on, Gary, get this thing up. Come on! Plane up. Come on, fly. [gunfire] Come on, baby, fly. Come on, Gary, fly this thing. Take it up or I'll blow your fucking head off! [gunfire] Take it up now! We did it! We did it, yeah! Woohoo! Woohoo! [screaming] We're going home! Anything I can do, Captain? Yeah, see if you can get the Coast Guard on the radio. Coast Guard, can you read us? MAN (ON RADIO): This is Search 7, US Coast Guard. Over. Shh, shh. This is the missing Tolliver party. I can't believe it. Come on in. MAN (ON RADIO): Well, that's great. Give me your location, over. Yeah. All yours, Captain. It's civilization. Altitude 900 feet, heading 030. MAN (ON RADIO): Roger, we just picked you up on the radar. Keep bearing due west, and we'll bring you in. Would you look at this? There's gotta be like 100,000 grand back here! Oh, my god! I can't believe it. - What? Let me see it! We're rich! And our parents thought we'd never amount to anything. [music playing] SONG: They're coming at me from all sides and trying to give me some strong advice. They're trying to get me for a long ride. I get the feeling that they're trying to turn me to ice. I let them treat me like a big man. I let them treat me like they're all grown up. I don't need nothing but a cool jam. I don't know why they're always trying to make such a fuss. Cool party. What do they want from me? I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I kept it hidden for a long time. I didn't want them to get all shook up. They thought everything was real fine. They never knew that I was almost ready to cut. I let them buy me with the small talk. I let them buy me with the bad routine. And then I told them they were all talk. And then I noticed that they all began to be. Cool party. Where do they come from? What are their names? What are their games? I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control. I wanna be anything you want me to be. Just let me be out of control.
