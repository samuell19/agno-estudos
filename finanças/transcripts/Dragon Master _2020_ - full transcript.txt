Ancestor, I have been practicing for many years. And been hit by lightning. Why can't I pass God's test for my cultivation? Thunder, ground, and fire. You have passed two of these three tests, but you still have to pass the mortal test. Mortal test? If you want to pass this test, you have to enter the mortal world to find your sacrifice and shed a tear for them. But, Ancestor, us dragons have no tears. Reincarnation is infinite. In the unseen world, there are things that are predestined. Sister, you're going to the mortal world? I want to go too. I'm going there for cultivation, not for fun. I heard that, in the mortal world, there are the sun, moon, and stars. With the wind there are stone bridges, rain, fog, and bed of flowers. Oh right. Fascinating mountains too! Sister... Sister, I would love to see it. You do your cultivation, and I promise you I won't mess around. [Dragon Master | Dragon Hunting Squad] Sister, so this is the mortal world! How lively! Calm down. Walk properly. Boring. Why can't I have fun? - You are beautiful. - Stop that. You are so beautiful. You are so beautiful. Come and catch me. Stop running. I will catch you! You can't catch me! Help! Catch him! Thank you, Xiu Yuan, for helping us out. I was late. Who is Xiu Yuan? You don't know that? He ranks at the top of the new generation of demon slayers from Qingcheng Mountain. This candy is for you. Dragon... Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan! What's wrong? Xiu Yuan... Xiu Yuan... Xiu Yuan... Xiu Yuan... Xiu Yuan... Xiu Yuan... You are awake, finally. What do you want? This lady i-insisted on w-waiting here by your bed. W-we've been trying to persuade her for a long time It's up to you now. Miss. Even though we met once, but I don't know who you are. My name is San Sheng. My name is Xiu Yuan. Xiu Yuan? I'll keep that in mind. Xiu Yuan. You're so good-looking. G-girls nowadays are s-so straightforward. Right. Xiu Yuan, you are amazing! How can you subdue that demon with only one strike? - Miss, please respect yourself. - Did she fall in love with Xiu Yuan? Men and women should keep a distance. No kiss? I'm not going to kiss you. - Miss. - San Sheng. Right, San Sheng. Who on earth are you and why are you here? I am from... somewhere far away. You wouldn't know even if I told you. What a strange girl. She can't even say where she's from. Xiu Yuan, were you knocked out by her? Yes. No! Yes or no? I don't know what happened, you know, I just passed out. Xiu Yuan f-fainted at the sight of her. T-there must be s-something wrong with her. Could it be... that she is a demon too? Xiu Yuan, try and look for her real body. - What is this? - No! - This is called the Eye of God. - What is this thing? It can reflect the real body of a monster. Miss. I'm sorry. Captain... how did you get hurt? What did you see? Miss, I'm sorry. We were wrong about you. Let me have a look too then! - No, no, don't look at it. - Just one look. I don't think it's possible to capture a dragon. Our dragon hunting team probably have to break up tomorrow. You can't stand such a small setback. You useless thing. How can you repay His Highness's kindness towards us? Right. This is such a nice place to stay. We should stay for a few more days. Who's there? Go! Alert! Dad! Dad! You're the one who killed my family! Die! Xiao Fang? Come on. Come here. You b-betrayed me. How dare you come? I'm gonna kill you! Master, let me explain! Master! You rebel! Sister? They have been controlled by my dragon mirage. Leave with me quickly. What? Dragon mirage? In that case... Xiu Yuan... What are you doing? I... Nothing. It's nothing. It's dangerous here. Don't be misled by humans. Let's go. Sister! Sister! Go! Are you okay? I'm fine. Xiu Yuan! No! Don't come here! Sister. That person looks like you. Anyone who is controlled by mirage will see the most frightening memories deep inside their hearts. Could it be... Let's go. Stop chasing. No, no. All are nothing but illusions. Close your eyes and you shall see nothing. Use the Eyes of God! A dragon scale? It's just a dragon scale. Is it that scary? Greetings, Your Highness. Your Highness? I didn't expect the top ranking Demon Slayer this year is afraid of dragons. Neither did I expect that last year's top ranking Demon Slayer is Your Highness. I've never seen the emblem on your chest. Is there any unique meaning to it? Do you know why I am afraid of dragons? Because I was once a human sacrifice of a dragon. Let me out! Is there anybody? Let me out! Let me out! Let me out. Let me out! Let me out. Let me out. If you're afraid of dragons, why would you come to catch them? Since ancient times, people and demons can not coexist. I have vowed to catch all the evil dragons of the world to become a true Dragon Master and never allow them to wreak havoc in the mortal world. You and I are kindred spirits. I was right about you. Sister. Sister... Why did you drag me back here? Don't pretend to be innocent. I shouldn't have brought you here. You are not obedient. It's not like that... I don't have time to play with you. I have to go check on the sacrifice. Sister! If Xiu Yuan is your human sacrifice, would you hurt him? Sister, Xiu Yuan is not a bad person. The only value of humans is to help us go through God's tests. You must keep this in mind. But we shouldn't hurt them either. You know what I am suffering every day? In order to cultivate? I have to suffer the pain of a burning heart from 5 to 7 o'clock every night. In six days, if my cultivation is unsucessful, I will die in ashes. Sister! You stay right here. Don't make any more trouble for me. Buddhism master. How dare you! It's fine. Everything is as you predicted, Xiu Yuan was that white dragon's human sacrifice. We made it! We made it! Could it be, you have broken through the Dragon Array? At five o'clock in six days from now, will be the time for the White Dragon's God's test. This is the only moment that her body will be empty of mana and she will spit out her dragon soul. At that time, all you have to do is lead her into Qingcheng Mountain. Congratulations, Your Highness! We will follow Your Highness to the death! To capture the dragon and bring an even more prosperous society! With the dragon scale as proof, there must have been a dragon around last night. You cannot be careless. Your Highness, just order us to do things like this. You don't need to do it yourself. It is my duty to do my best for the emperor. What's more, in six days, it'll be the emperor's birthday ceremony. We must take this dragon search seriously. Yes. Come with me! What's wrong? Why are you so quiet today? Am I? Could it be because you're still afraid of dragons? How can that be? If that dragon appears, I will bring it down. This talisman can keep you safe. Take it. Thank you, Senior. Your Highness! There's something here! Look, Your Highness. As I expected! Your Highness, I-I f-found something over there too. Something's wrong. Be careful! Protect His Highess! It's you? Your Highness, are you okay? A bunch of useless trash! Please forgive us, Your Highness! We will do our best to bring the dragon back! It's really not him... Oh no. It's time. Who are you? Why did you attack us? Speak! Who am I? You don't deserve to know. Are you a demon? You're awake? Why are you still here? I've looked all around, there's only one way out, to climb up from here. Sorry for that. What are you doing? I can't be bothered to explain. Hey. How much do you eat every day? You're so fat. Shut up. Are you a human or not? You have no empathy. I took the trouble to carry you up on my back. Yet you are not grateful at all. Cut the crap. In any case, I promise not to kill you when I get up there. All right. Be careful! Let go of my hand. Hold on tight. We're finally up here. Miss. Miss? Don't... touch me. Miss? Miss! I should take you to the doctor. I brought you to the doctor yet you refused, insisting on going home. Where should we go now? Over there. Okay. Is there anyone? Is this the place? Xiu Yuan? Miss San Sheng? - Sister? - Sister? What's wrong with you, sister? Why are your hands so cold? What's the matter? It's a long story. Bring my sister over there. Come. Be careful. Xiu Yuan, I need to heal my sister. Please excuse us for a moment All right. Sister... How did it go? Is she all right? She's fine now. The stars are all covered up by the rain and fog. Yes. You like to look at the stars too? Yes. I think stars are the most beautiful things in the world. There's a poem called "Like the Stars, Like the Moon, Like the..." Does it go "I wish for I to be like the stars, and you to be like the moon. Every night the light shines bright." Yes! That's it. But this is a love poem. You shouldn't recite it to just anyone. I got it. Xiuyuan, thank you for saving my sister. Don't mention it. It's my pleasure. This is for you. For me? This is a hairpin. That's right. A hairpin for you. Us, men, don't need that. That day I saw a lot of men buying this at the market. I thought you all liked it. They must have bought it for their wives at home or for the ladies they like as a token of love. Token of love? I'll give it to you then. No, no. I can't accept this gift. San Sheng? Sister? Sister. Sister, you are awake. Why did you get up? I have found the human sacrifice. It's not him. It's the human who attacked us on the roof. It's him? You, take me to look for the man who saved your life today. Why are you looking for that man? You don't need to know. Xiuyuan, my sister wants to find him because she likes him. What? My sister fell in love with him at first sight. But due to external circumstances, they can't meet each other. So, she can only meet him in private. How is that possible? My senior is a prince. How could you pester him? A prince? So what if he's a prince? My sister is our- San Sheng! Xiu Yuan, please help us out. Sure. I was about to bring you to His Highness too. As soon as we meet him, the truth about what you said will come out. Where is everyone? Exactly. Where is everyone? It's so scary. Men and women should keep a distance. Stop that. What are you doing? Catch the dragon! Let me explain! His Highness? His Highness! - His Highness! - His Highness! - His Highness! - His Highness! Stop, everyone. Don't... hurt her. Yes! It was indeed you, the dragon who took me away in the past. How dare you! Since you know who I was, why hide it? Because I don't have the intention to catch you. If you do this, how can you pass the cultivation test? How did you know I have to pass the mortal test? Because I know, when the time for you to pass the test, you will surely look for me. At that time, I ran away in fear. But I didn't expect that I'd keep thinking about you. Humans are so honey-lipped. According to legend, when a dragon goes through the mortal test, it'd require the dragon to cry a tear. Though I don't know how to make you cry, but I will do my best. Why should I believe that you'd help me? Helping you is also helping myself. There is drought in northwest has brought misfortunes to the people. As the prince. I must do something for my country. It is said that dragons can control the wind and rain. I need your strength to save the world. Are you willing? Can you really help me shed tears? I'm not sure, but I'm willing to try. If I do help you out, will you be willing to help me save the world? Why are you still here? Be careful! Stars and moon are clear and bright, it's really a good day to moongaze. Stop. Tell me, how can I shed tears? Shed tears? Yes. I was born incapable of tears. I really want to feel how it's like to shed a tear. Do you have any ways? It's no use asking you. Isn't it good that you're incapable of tears? Tears mean sorrow. If your friends or family members see you tear, they're going to be sad. That's right. If a family sheds tears, the person who sees it will feel upset. If my senior sees you shed tears, I'm sure he will be upset too, right? Then I'll leave you two to it. For us, mortals, longing disturbs our hearts, and hatred brings sorrow. We are filled with joy due to tears. I would like to accompany you to feel it. If you continue to pull a long face, you're wasting this beautiful scenery. The lanterns are so beautiful this year. The lanterns are so beautiful! This year's temple fair is better than last year's. Let's go. So this is the Qixi Temple fair? It's so lively! Xiu Yuan, what are they doing? They are worshipping the Weaver. Weaver? Why do they worship the Weaver? Because... Because... You don't know? I'll go ask them then! Why do you worship the Weaver? Because we want to make a wish to the Weaver goddess to let us meet our Mr. Right soon. Mr. Right? Miss Sheng Xue. Is Miss Sheng Xue not interested in the temple fair? Why ask when you already know the answer? That's bad then. I prepared a little gift I wanted to give to you. Do you like it? This way! Miss San Sheng. Miss San Sheng! - What are you doing? - What's the matter? What are you doing? Stop messing around and let's get down there. What's the matter? You want to dance? - Why don't you get down and dance yourself? - What the hell are you doing? Can I borrow this? It's past seven, why is my heart still burning? Could it be... What's the matter? Is it because the mortal test is upon you so... Here. Let me bring you to heal your body. What are you doing? Captain. What are you doing? Xiu Yuan, everyone knows that the emperor is offering a high reward for dragons captured. How dare you defend evil dragons openly! Evil dragon? What evil dragon? I think you've been seduced by her beauty. You didn't even realize that these sisters are evil dragons. That day, at the Dragon Hunt Inn, His Highness was willing to sacrifice himself to protect that evil dragon, because it was just an expedient. Now that the evil dragon has been captured, it will be presented to the emperor in Qingcheng Mountain tomorrow. Sister! Now it's your turn! The one who captured the dragon will get a promotion. Those who dare to interfere, will be killed with no mercy! Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan! Remember, you must not show your dragon body. Once you show your dragon body, your heart will burn, your constitution will be greatly undermined, and you might even disappear into ashes. Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan, wake up! Be careful. Xiu Yuan! I wish for I to be like the stars, and you to be like the moon. Every night the light shines bright. My name is San Sheng. Xiu Yuan, you are so good-looking. Token of love? I'll give it to you. What is Mr. Right? That means your husband. I want Xiu Yuan to be my husband. No, no. [Fire] Time's up! This moment is finally here. The human test has come. Go get her dragon soul! What do you want? I want your dragon soul. Congratulations, Your Highness. Sister! There is one more? San Sheng. San Sheng! If God is against me, I'm sure to kill him. Since you want to die, I'll fulfill your wish! San Sheng! Xiu Yuan. Xiu Yuan. Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan! Xiu Yuan... Xiu Yuan. Idiot. You could have saved your life. Since you fear dragons, I deliberately arranged it such that this dragon won't be able to find you. This talisman can keep you safe. Take it. The dragons are nothing special. They get tricked by just petty tricks. He's your human sacrifice. What tears, what emperor's birthday? These are all traps I've set up. How is it? Even if you knew it, It's already too late. You... Why? Why? If God abandons me, I can abandon it too. If the world abandons me, the world should be doomed! The 10th Prince. The emperor's 10th son. So what if they are at the top of the list? So what if they could slay demons? They are just chess pieces. They have no qualifications to inherit the throne. But now I have the dragon soul. With the power of the real dragon, who else can deny my identity as the dragon prince? You are insane. San Sheng. San Sheng! Xiu Yuan... It's nice... to meet you... If there is an afterlife... Find me... Protect me carefully... Sister... Sister... I won't cause you any more troubles. San Sheng, no! San Sheng! San Sheng! Father, you're unfair. Why does my sister have a human sacrifice but not me? If I don't have it, so other people are not allowed to have one too. What are you doing? Go. As a dragon, we are all proud of flying dragons. It's you... who let me see the beauty of the world. The more I try to resist you, the more I want to be close to you. It's also because of you that I realize there really is unrequited love in the mortal world. Now that my sister is gone, I'm alone. What's the point of passing the mortal test? This is my dragon soul, I'll give it to you. It can protect you for your whole life. 💞 Thank you to our Channel Manager 🐉 saber_lily 💞 Thank you to our Chief Segmenter 🐉 miss_rochester and Segmenter queen_sung_kyung 💞 Thank you to our Chief Editor 🐉 cerejacult 💞 Thank you to our Translation Editor 🐉 trangstar888 💞 Thank you to our OL Moderators 🐉 samandriel, daiemyllygunnarsen_878, klore6, salapaw_359, baka_0077 Xiu Yuan, you are free now.
