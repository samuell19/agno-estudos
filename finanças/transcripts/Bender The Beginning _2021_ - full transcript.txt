Only shoot at the crows. He says not much. What does "not very" mean? Here is the quality mark on the boxes. Hello Mr Hammett. Mr Trotsky! I beg. Mr. Trotsky, he says he is very happy to help the world revolution and trade your best weapons for works of art. You don't care about world revolution but today we can offer you something that will definitely interest you. Believe me, this is something special. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. Rumor has it that it brings happiness or death to its owner. I give you a million. Count Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky received this baton from the hands of Empress Catherine for the capture of the Bendery fortress. It's robbery, you know. All right, Trotsky. Buying stolen goods. You don't have other customers, do you? You are surrounded by enemies. What will you fight back? Wand? Or weapons bought with my money? I feel like I'm wasting my time. Damn you. Million.

Now we will hang it. What will the people on the train say about us? Let's not arrange a free circus, but take money for it. Look, a man is being hanged. Sold the gold ring. I cracked, and there is copper! There was no need to pry. You said you love it! Did you steal the brooch yourself? Madam Zitz, Bender never lies when it comes to true love. These are all the machinations of your relatives. They want to separate us. Don't believe me, I didn't steal your brooch. Moreover, you yourself gave me something more precious. What? your innocence. You should easily part with this at your age. Gentlemen, your joke has dragged on! It will drag on even longer. I will appear to you dead at night! Lord, accept the soul of your sinful Turkish subject's slave. Not! But! Let's go! Hey! Stand! Stop! Stop, comrade! Comrade! Helping hand, comrade! Brooch! Gold, diamonds! Well?

In a coffin with... with... a... ko... sh... h... What window? Hey! In that? Hey! What window? You! E! Commissioner! I found you. Get out. What kind of commissioner am I? This is a disguise. I am mine, brother. I am an anarchist. Nephew of Bakunin. A coffin with a window, right? Oh what girls! Do you know why Jews don't eat chocolate? They get heartburn from the foil. There's only half. Look, I'll get my fee now. I swear I'll bring everything. Are you sure it's him? Young man, Fuchs knows everything about everyone. You are pennies to me, and I will seal you with a coat of arms. Original! You'll bring the rest to Bristol. And find out who your dad is. Here is the fee. So, go get ready! You are next. Misha, here is all the money. Misha, where did he go? Where did he go, Misha? He thought you were greedy. Misha please! Misha, please. Misha, have mercy, I... I already have losses! Listen here, Valiadis. Tell that to your house by the sea. Get away from here. - Well? - Lamb wildebeest. You promised to pay me for last week. Am I a serf artist to work for food? Mishka has your money, just like mine. What do you suggest? Go and pick up? Well, go and get it. Girls. Ladies and Gentlemen! The best audience in this city! Next, an artist of the original genre will perform in front of you. Reader, coupletist and melody reciter - Osya Zadanaisky! "Hamlet", Shakespeare. Monologue. Come on Hamlet! so what? "To be or not to be, that is the question. What is better, what is nobler for the soul: Endure the blows of the arrows of the warring fortune or rise up... " Rise! Fun. Madam, I'm sorry, but what are you laughing at? He will now finish with the sweet and will definitely take you. I'm serious, you can trust me. Every evening with a new lady. And then no one sees them. He eats them. Just look, we have here white, red, green, Denikin, Petliura, Entente, Directory, Greeks! Lord, yes, I have had fewer foster dads in my whole life, than the authorities in Solnechnomorsk this year alone! And I'm sure, while you and I are sitting here, a couple more times it will change for sure. But but but! Only one power never changes. Real. Yes? Criminal. Ltd! Here. Did I say something wrong? BUT? - Stop... - Quit being coquettish. Well, who among you does not pay Vinnitsa? Here you are, for example. How much do you pay a third? God. Half. It's... Shakespeare. Free translation. Free, free. Apparently more. So that's what, ladies, I think that with such success he will be accepted. and for your clients... Hands off! See? They need to crush absolutely everything under themselves. - Osya! Osya! - Yes Yes? Vinnitsky is here. Vinnitsky here? Where? I must have missed something. Where... BUT... So this is a rat-bear! Go on, go on. I was talking about Mendel. The real Vinnitsa. And by the way, here he is. Hello. Take fast! Run to catch up! Catch up fast! - Get out of here! - Getting in! - Like this! - Oh, don't. - Op! - Hello. Hello. So... uh... well... Op! Op! And what is it in your hands? What is your item? - My. - Then take it! Money! Catch run! Get it, I say! Yes, grab him! Where is the third one? I ordered three coffins from Bezenchuk. - Carefully! - Three. Where is the third? Swallow, am I out of my mind? - At the station they said to ask Makhno. - Bring it in. His savages shot in the steppe yesterday. There are so many corpses! Haha! Marik, we'd be sweating counting our profits. Makhno has a taste for a beautiful life. Here! Hold on tight, I said! Five of you are not worth as much as this one coffin! Don't hit the corners, asshole. - Where is he?! He darted into the yard. A-ah-ah... What a coincidence. Ah-ah-ah! I am in the hands of the enemy. And caught in the net - What? - Nothing. Chasing me, I say. Hide. - Where? To the safe? - No, in the coffin. - Listen... - If you don't want to be alive, you'll lie down dead. Persuaded. Mademoiselle Sophie. And you are impatient, Misha. I have a whole day before you. Needle? Truth? With cadaveric poison. From the wound in a day you will die. Oh! - I heard a scream. - I saw a rat. Rat? I'm going to dream what I'll do with you tomorrow. So, but I didn’t understand something, what will be there tomorrow? Wedding! He is my fiancé. Bear? I beg you... He used to hang cats as a child. I saw you in the gymnasium theatre. Othello? And How? Not without talent. About Mishka. Do you really love him? None of your business. Dad says he is rich, he can hold on to any power. What more could a poor girl dream of? Dad says, mom says... What are you thinking about yourself? Look, get the hell out of here, or I'll change my mind about saving you. Good... - But! Everything, everything, everything... Sorry. Sorry. Mother! Who are all these people? Buyers. I am selling a house. - We are leaving for Constanta, from there to Paris. - Aaa. You need to run from this country! - Yes? - Yes. Did you ask me? Ax, well, what to ask? Actually, this is my audience. This audience expects jokes from you, not Shakespeare. Do not worry. There are more Russians in Paris and less shooting. Yes, you're still not going anywhere. The queue for the ship for a month. You know, such a crush... Here you are! "Citizen Poleyko was crushed by refugees while boarding the ship." Do you want to be like Poleyko? But who needs this ship? Who is this? Monsieur? Smuggler. He will take us out. My man will do everything in the best possible way. And I still can't go. I have a girl here. Why am I only finding out about her now? Because we just met today. "So you're leaving tomorrow." - What? Love brings nothing but trouble, Osya. So I'm a nuisance? - Osya! What, you loved your father? You don't have a father. You are immaculately conceived. We're leaving tomorrow. Well, then I'll find him today. Search! Search! Search! There must be money. Where's the money? Give me two more weeks. Two weeks was two weeks ago. Sign papers. I have a wife, children. A wife, consider a widow, children are orphans! I swear I will. Sign. I have a business. Dad, why do we need these warehouses? So we haven't stolen that much yet. This is for the rain from banknotes. What kind of Vinnitsa are you, if you are not afraid?! - Well, take it off. - Dad! - Shoot. - Dad, don't. Shoot! Hand! Old Man. If it wasn't for you, you idiot, my son, I would have died in peace. I'm in this world only because of your stupidity! Nothing can. - Dad, don't. - Nothing. Who will I leave the matter to? - Dad... Maybe I'll have to deal with your wife later, huh?! Well, be quiet. Ah-ah-ah! I'll die - look, remember what your father taught. I'll kill you bitch. Shakespeare! The last one left. Delight for the eyes in an age of turmoil. Don't want Shakespeare for 25? Well, I think my father is an anarchist or a polar explorer. And much is missing? Twenties. 80 are already there. And if it turns out that he is a thief or a murderer? Well, you'd better keep your money. Shakespeare! Nobody needs? The last one left. I am already leaving. How much is Shakespeare for the people? I'll give you 20. Do you take? For twenty? And not sorry? I memorized it to the core. Will there be change from a hundred? Just 80. Thanks to. Well, check, are they real? Hey! Collected on the porch, or what? Give me back my hundred. I found 20 for you. - On the. - Happy. Good luck in the theatre. Thanks to. Give it to mom. Ma'am, let me help you. If you want to help, take things. Uh... Do you think we are stuck in this hole for a long time? Don't know. It is in your interest to be more zealous. - Careful. - Sorry. Undoubtedly, with your talent, you can buy something unique here. I hope you are not mistaken. We don't have much time. Lux please. Please number seven. - Excuse me, but... - Settlement at check-out. But we have rules... You shouldn't be so worried. My name is Ewa Makhulskaya. I am a Polish princess. And my uncle is a German baron von... Yes, everyone knows him. Have a nice holiday. Baron. Sorry. Monsieur Fuchs. Everybody is here. Original. Well... Youth! With Fuchs, such numbers do not work. How much is Shakespeare for the people? On the porch, perhaps, did you collect a trifle? Give me back my hundred. This... Monsieur Fuchs, I swear to you, I will bring everything. When you bring it, then we'll talk. Mom, I don't want for that rat. Yes... Do you want to live, huh? Lord... Rats, my dear, come up with any power. And we will sail with them. God only gave us a body, daughter. And you can sell it either once at a high price, or often and for a penny. You are selling me. You will sell yourself, but I have a lot of experience. When I married your father was twice her age. Mom... Okay, one and a half. An old undertaker with hairy nostrils. And then you fell in love with him? There is no love in the world. But there is peace and... Money. Help me change? Herself. Good. Come, please, come. What are you doing here? They'll kill you if they see you. - God bless them. Go away, you're crazy. Well, of the two of us, I'm not the one talking to the portrait. By the way, who is this? This is my protector. Lieutenant Schmidt. Do you remember the Potemkin uprising? Naturally. As they started to shoot, the crowd almost trampled me, and he picked it up in his arms and raised it above all. And he said that he would always protect me, you just have to call. Ah-ah-ah! And you are like him. Maybe you are my protector? - Can you come with me then? - Where? Well, let's go to Paris, to Warsaw... to Berlin - wherever you want. I will perform, and you will be with me. Oh! So let me... Be here. Sir, what guests. Mendel, what is the matter that it was impossible to endure until the morning? The groom wants to hear your word. In the morning, the bride will not change her mind about getting married? Mendel, what are you talking about? Well, let's go to the house... Let's go. Good taste, Moishe. See you tomorrow, Mademoiselle Sophie! (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |) Did the prodigal son find his dad? - Ah-ah-ah! - Don't yell. They'll fix both. - Lord, are you thieves? - Well, everything, pipets. As my Jewish dad used to say, don't steal from losses, steal from profits. - He's a thief. - Shh. Imagine walking past, looking - stealing. Ah-ah, so this is the Transdanubian bastard. And who is the second? Give me a hat, little one. Little hat. - Ahh... - It's late. So this is Abram Bender in person. Ibrahim Bender, Turkish subject. Although what to take from you. Mendel... Mendel, I... I beg you, but not here. I have enough of my dead. If I were you, I would listen. You don't invite guests. Moron. Thief. Come on, come on. They chose a coffin from Sokolovich. Feel free, Mendel pays. And what about me? I brought this to you. Steal, dog. Abram is the only one who deceived me and got away with it. For 17 years I represented our meeting. Looking for words... And now I don't know what to say. Well, think another 17 years, I'm not in a hurry. So after 17 years, my dad already... Jerk. It would be better if you were my son than this miracle. Oh god, I'd change. Why don't you adopt us both? I don't know about him, but I would be happy to have a dad like Mendel. Misha... On the. Untie him. Come on, come on. That's between me and him. I have no complaints about you. Go. Go, go, go. Boys! Hold them, they killed their father! - Here's the bastard, huh! - Raised! I tell you raised! Quiet, quiet, quiet. I want them to die slowly and beautifully. - BUT? - I agree. - Don't push! - You're bothering me too. Come on. Come on, come on! Well! Don't interfere. Bay! Let's! Well, something, lads, we can’t do it beautifully. BUT? Manilyuk. Head of the operational department of the Solnechnomorsk Cheka. - Ours to you. - Noise, then? The killers were caught. They killed his father. Yes, they killed it! Yoperny Theatre. Well, I'll take it. This is a blatant slander. I'm not even going... Take them, take them. Forward! Where are you running?! Come on, come on! Let's go! Get ready! Aim! Pli! Take them away. Similar? Your prints were found on this razor. - Both. - Listen, commissioner. What's the point of me killing Papa Mendel? I had the most tender relationship with him. He actually wanted to adopt me. Yes, what are you saying? This is true! Commissioner, I have a hunch that I'll still be of use to you. And me too. In the world we're building like you we don't need. So I doubt that your new world does not need artists. Comrade Commissar, do you have a wife? Children? A family? Interesting. I have a brother. AND? And great! You and brother, after your working day, go to rest. Where? That's right, the theatre. As the chief administrator, I will give you front row seats. - Sit down comfortably... - There is Shakespeare in its entirety! Horse! Horse! Half the kingdom for a horse! Call me something else, Romeo, and then take all of me in return. - Ha-ha-ha! - Sit down. Sorry. "The most important of all the arts for us is cinema." Lenin said. We forgot the theater, we are doing cinema. - I can be a director. - Silent movies are generally my forte. Shoot at dawn. I sympathize with you little one. Both! Give me your watch. Yes now! Only over my dead body! Well, I say. At expense. - In a cell. - Come on, come on! - Maybe we can agree, comrade? - Into the cage! Ugh! Yeah, fraud, theft, card cheating. - Resurrection is dead... - Faster. Become. Get ready. Aim. Pli! Ownership is gone. Read Marx. What's your name, hotheaded idiot? - Ostap! - Wow. Mom loves Gogol? Oh, those reading ladies. Life, Ostap, unlike novels, is divided not into swindlers and honest, but into swindlers and fools. You are fool. Sorry for being direct. It is because of you that we are here. What the hell are you doing to me? I am here because of you. What the hell were you stealing? Well, not you! Well... Me too. That is life. You are fooling, or you are being fooled. You still owe me science. What other science? Fools die first. You will die first. Here and now. And I... in a hundred years. In his own mansion in Rio de Janeiro. - I wish you success. - Osya! Axis! Osya! - Sonya! - Sonya! - Sonya. - Sonya. - Sonya! - Come on, come on! Throw! Throw! Way down. - Sonya, down. - Sonya! Here, here. - Osya... - Huh? Be so kind as to give me my lockpicks. - These ones? - Yes, these are. With pleasure. - Osia... - Youth won. Give it back! Osya! Osya! This is my property! And "property - it's gone." So with Marx? Osya! Osya! Osya, give it back! I'll get us both out. You alone cannot... Osya! Osya! God, why are you helping this cretin and not me?! Osya! Good! Okay, I'll tell you what I did at the Sokolovichi. So... I was looking for a treasure. - Wand. - Wand? The golden baton of Count Rumyantsev, studded with diamonds. He is somewhere in one of the coffins at the Sokolovichi. - Truth? - I swear. I'll go check. Osya! Osya, don't quit... Osya! Osha, okay. I... I am your father. You? Judge for yourself. I'm age-appropriate. I have been to Solnechnomorsk, I have known counts. - Dad... - Son. We are like two drops of the same water. Open to dad. You are a bastard, dad. Wait. Well, well, well, well. Maybe I'm not your father, but could you help me in a human way? Like a Christian! Christianly, yes. These ones! These ones! Unfortunately, I am not a believer. Osya! - Ostap! - Goodbye, dad. You son of a bitch. Misha, I came up with everything fun. We'll have a wedding and a funeral together. I'll talk to the rebbe and the orchestra about the discount. Well... wholesale, after all. As my dad used to say, and my dad spoke sweetly and burred a little: "I work around the clock, my hands are bleeding." As I. Why not save? Yes, papa! Misha, he escaped from prison. How did he escape? So if you ran away, then collect everyone running! - Misha! - Escaped... What? - Can I talk to you? - Speak. I wanted to poison myself with vinegar, you disgust me so much, but I will become yours, if you leave Ostap alive. If you lie to me, I will stab you. And then I'll stab him. And then I'll stab your parents, you understand? Now go to the bedroom and wait, bride. Sonya! Collect things. - The boat to Constanta is waiting for us. - I'm not going with you. How is it "I won't go"? Then why did you save me? You would have left me there, that's all. Yes, you look at yourself and at him. You are a beggar and a bastard, and the whole city bows at his feet. Leave before I call the groom. Yeah. And I thought... fall in love. Who needs your love? You made it all up. Leave. Leave who you told! Well... Goodbye. I love you. I love you. Me too... love myself. Good afternoon. Newspaper and envelope, please. 70 kopecks from you. I'll give you 40 and be healthy. 70. OK OK. Only a newspaper. Sorry. - Here. - What? Money. Check. - Another newspaper. - Sorry. You never know your bastard dad's name in your life! Okay, okay, sorry. I'll bring 200. Listen, bullshit. Bitch, ah! Well? Where to look for it? In the rooms. No. What do you owe, gentlemen? We catch a thief. We need to search the room. Want - search. And then what? There the princess is washing herself in the bathroom. - Right? - What's the matter? I asked you not to interfere! The hotel is looking for a thief. Searching the room. Please, I beg you, don't give out. What did you steal? I didn't steal anything. So go and explain it to them. I think they will understand you. Okay, okay. I stole one little thing but she's really mine. You see, all my life I've been looking for my father. And this freak tried to convince me that he was my father. He told tales about some kind of golden rod... What am I, a fool or something, to believe him? Nobody will believe. What wand? Madam, we must see if there is a thief here. We're coming in, ma'am. Did you see what you wanted? Sorry, ma'am. Well, what are you staring at? Go! More sorry. Well? Thank you. Where are you going? Now they won't come here. What? Oh my God. Well? Is this your first time? What does first time mean? Poor boy. We all. We, too. Well... And what is your name? Just like you. No way. We don't have names. A-ah-ah... Why would you then... For the moment. Wait, is that all? Promise you won't forget me. Of course, I will try, but know that I have a very short memory. O! "Turkish subject..." I have one question. You are a Turkish citizen, right? A very timely question. What else interests you? Am I circumcised? Do I pray five times a day? Answer! Yes, I am a Turkish citizen. And what does it change? In counting. From this day forward, I never want to know you. Mom! - Mom! - Osya! - Our dad... - Well, where have you been? - Is our father Turkish? - I almost lost my mind. Turk? Tell me! Is your father Turkish or not? Answer! I have only one question for you. Isn't his name Ibrahim by chance, huh? - I don't want to talk about it ever. - Oh, you don't want to talk about it?! - Of course... - Enough, let's go. - You're right. - Come on, come on, sit down. Come on, come on. Yes, but are we going to Constanta on this trough? Don't worry boy. - My... here it is. - Yes. All moms, and I'll be later. I need to deal with my father, with Sonya. - With this second one, how is it... - Where are you going? What are you! - Mom... - Osya! Osya! - Osya! - Mom, mom, be careful! Hold on, hold on, otherwise it will fall! Where? Are you crazy? Mom! Mom, don't worry. Truth. I'm an adult. Row more smoothly! Mom, I swear I'll find you. Do not worry. Mom, I've become a man. I didn't tell you about this though, so don't worry about me. Mom, I love you very much! Let's go! Come on, come on, walk! Do you know why they shoot at dawn? Man is defenseless at this time in front of nature. There is a ringing purity in this. I, too, will be clean before you. You are an enemy and a killer. You and others like you have destroyed my country. Crystal world of my childhood. It's not that I value life, no. I'm close... aesthetics of chaos. The dark beauty of destruction. But I have order in this city. Do you like explosions? In every city we took on our way here, you left bombs. In crowded places. With a large crowd of people. Tell me the time and place. And I'll introduce you to death. Time? Soon. Place? There will be many, many people there. But you still can't stop us. Your world will burn. And what kind of music do you prefer? Offenbach? Chopin? Wagner? Wagner. How bad is it? Petliura has 30,000 sabers. We cannot hold the city without mobilization. Detain all men over 18. - Let's! - Quietly! How many years? - Sorry? - How many years? - To me? 19. - It will do. Get in line! Kornilov needs soldiers. Come on, come on, come on! But I don't want to be a soldier. Stop, nit! Stop! Get in line! Fast! Come on, come on. Right! The only breadwinner! Get moving! Stand! Let's go! Behind me! Stand up, Bolshevik muzzle! Captain Ostenbacken, secret office. - What is your last name? - Kuz... Kuzmichev. Thank you for your service! Truly I say, by such Russia will be saved. I will apply. - Glad to try, your honor. Went! - Stop! Transdanubian... Our client is the leader of the red underground. I'm taking him. Documents would, your honor. Secret office, dummy. Secret. Am I supposed to carry documents with me? Because of such fools we drape! The request is cancelled. - Guilty. - Went! I didn't ask to be rescued. - If you don't like it, you can go back. - No thanks. - Live while he's in shock. We need somewhere to sleep. Thank you for your service! And where is the joyful victorious cry "Good morning, dad"? You are not my dad. But if so, then I do not consider you as such. I left my mother, I left my father. I will go to my mother as soon as possible. How do you get there without money? Well, that's not your problem anymore. Fortunately, I can fix this problem. How? Wand. Studded with gems. - Again these fairy tales? - These are not fairy tales, Osya. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity. And if you are not a complete idiot, you will use it. Are you an idiot? The eyes are smart. To dad. Let us suppose. How much can it cost? That is, outside of this restless country, I would give no less for him... two million. Two million?! "Yes it is." - I have a million. - Whoa, Osya, whoa. As the leader and ideological inspirer of the concession, I take 80% for myself. You 20%. This is true. Half. Or I don't agree. Osya, I give you 400,000! What will you do with this money? You and your mother don't have any fantasy. I know. Half. Stubborn in mother... yours. 40%. I thought you were a polar explorer. Revolutionary. Whoever imagined you. And you're just a pimp and a thief. Quiet, little one. Quiet. Do not fart the walleye. Rogue, yes. Adventurer, perhaps. But I have never been a thief. I punish human vices: Greed and vanity. And from now on, Osya... 30%. I agree. My God you are. How do you look like your mother. When we met her she was as fresh as a cherry blossom at the foot of Mount Fuji. Those eyes, stan... Those lips... Bender, enough. Let's get down to business. The coffin at the Sokolovichi. We take the rod at night. For the time being, find a cab driver, and I will arrange a boat. I wonder how we will get to Sokolovichi, if Mishka's bandits are constantly spinning there, huh? Of course, one could ask Sonya, but I don't think she'll help now. Faster Faster! The weather is getting worse. Hey! Is it weak to Istanbul tomorrow morning? If you have money - not weak. Will. Come quickly! - How many people? - As always, one. Well, see you tomorrow. What are we looking for? Wand. - In a coffin. - In a coffin. - With a window. - Yes, I understand! - Come on, Stanislavsky. - Who? Never mind. Take the master keys, Murzik. I'm in the auditorium. I hope I will clap. Don't wake anyone up. For the atmosphere. What are you doing here? So I came to explain to you. Why here and with a master key? (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |) Look, I can't explain everything to you. I received orders to stay in the city. - An order? - Yes, an order. From whom? Are you an underground? - Quiet! Can I help you somehow? Let's... - Heard how I clapped for you? - Heard, heard. - Okay, come on. - 40%. Where is the wand, Murzik? Unfortunately, he was not. It's empty there. But I found out there is another coffin. Mendel is buried in it tomorrow. Panikhida in the Assembly of the Nobility. I saved your life. thirty%. Bender! Bender! No, Bender, we just can't get in there. We'll enter through the main entrance as befits a gentleman: Elegant, with dignity. But money is needed. Not less than 300 rubles. How much do you have? I have two francs. But, unfortunately, we won't need them. - Shh! Come in handy. Misha, some people go there like at home. They don't respect your dad at all. What kind of people, Benya? Do you have any fat bloodsucker in mind, pinching which does not contradict your high moral principles? There is. 40%. Oh, small, many... - 40%. - A lot of. - 40%. - Good. I will think. Calm down, Sofa. Who are you? The staff captain of the Amethysts, the military commandant of this wonderful town. I control security at your event. No, did you hear? In this city, you have no control over anything. BUT! Still, I don't think we should quarrel. Gentlemen, take off your hats. Have respect - there is a dead person in the house. What European Union?! Well, this is a utopia! Valiadis. The owner of the establishment. - What did he do wrong? - At least, does not pay artists. Europe is rotten! - What do you think of this statute? Is it this fat boar in a raspberry waistcoat? It is he. Europe, Europe! Europe will save us, I assure you. Artists are children. And hurting them is a crime. Clemenceau will come and make a paradise city out of Solnechnomorsk. Here you will see. Farewell to Mendel Vinnitsky today in the Nobility Assembly! Passion for politics, Osya, betrays in an individual not only idiocy, but also a keen desire to be deceived. We are working. Escuze mua, is the coffee real? - Offend. - Oh, merci.

You can't buy me. - What, so honest? - Yes... That he is me... afraid. Misha will get me out of the ground. A-ta-ta.. Finita la comedy. Don't you have a plan? Along the way, no. Even though you were a bad father, Bender, I'm glad I met you. Don't want to interrupt your sentimentality but i have an important question. I hear. If I kill him, will it be 10 chi 11 thousand? Misha, you promised to "find" a thousand, which is already mine. And whoever kills gets a gold piece. So I want to know is it on top? Or counting? Let it be on top. Wow. Misha! Misha! - Who shot? - Benya, I still hold him at gunpoint... - Benya, it's him. - He pushes me. - I'm asking... - I kept it at gunpoint. Who was shooting?! - I'm asking! - I didn't shoot! Cattle. Where are these? Where are these?! Listen, we made it. Long live new life! - Hooray! Bender! - Quiet, quiet, quiet. - Did you see how I clack him?! - Yes Yes Yes... If it wasn't for me... By the way, what did you say about the bad dad? BUT? You hardly know me, and you have already drawn such bold conclusions. Maybe I'm not so bad? - Hooray! - Hey! Quiet! Let's open it, shall we? Are we opening? Osia, take your time, little one. - Take your time. - Why? We have been going to this for so long, and you want to be happy like this - once, and become happy? That doesn't happen. In this case, as in love, prelude is important. Let's fantasize. What will you do with your wealth? - I want to buy an apartment for my mother in Paris. - Ouch. Not! Better than a villa! On the Cote d'Azur, in Nice! Your crew, four horses, and... and... Mom should not forget to buy earrings. What about yourself? Shish yourself? And myself, Bender, what do I need? Well... a boat. I want to steer the ship! To transport across the Atlantic! Or better a big airplane and conquer the entire North Pole. - It's cold there, Osia. - Nothing. Well, what about you? I have never been to Rio de Janeiro. They say it's beautiful there. I'll buy myself white pants, a white yacht... and under a white sail I will go around the whole white world! Yes! What about mom? You said "mom". First to mom and then... - in Rio de Janeiro! - In Rio de Janeiro! Did you say you'd be alone? Take the bananas out of your ears. I said that I would be with my son. Will you pay for two? - One minute. - Start. Osya... Little one, give me this one... This is what I will open myself. Murzik! Ha! Bender! And here there is no wand. Coffin master Bezenchuk opens a collection of three luxury coffins. Coffin master Bezenchuk... yeah... unlocks a collection of three luxury coffins. Maybe she's golden? Brass. Yoperny Theatre. And how long will I wait for you? Go, he will take you to Constanta. And you? I'll stay. You want 100% for yourself. Not likely, Bender. Go, he will take you wherever you want. Osia, go to your mother. As there? In white pants, under a white sail all over the world... Good luck in Rio, Bender. Come to mom! Go to Rio, Bender. Tomorrow, same place, same hour. What am I, a tram? If you think that dad will let his son go alone to this terrible city, behind a golden rod with such diamonds, then you don't know Bender well. Old Man! After dancing on coffins, every dog ​​is ready to tear us to pieces in this city. I won't leave without a rod. Well, daughter, prepare the groom before the funeral. God, you are mine. Pinch me, Osya. Frankly, I'm intrigued. - Wand where? - My? What is a bronzer? - Misha! - That's not how things are done. Nestor Ivanovich, wedding. Let's get married. First the wand, and then "you are my woman, I am your man"... Or whatever you want? Mazal tov! We will die today. Have you fallen in love, Kotovsky? Music! Osya! I think it's a big day. Bender, if we die here, I will find you in the next world and kill you again. He found the wand. Wand! Wand! I held it right in my hands. Forget. Dead people don't need gold. The end of the film. No, Osya, not the end of the movie. Interesting to see the sequel. Very interesting. Behind me! (( Translate, Adjust & Modify )) (| Temimi Feras |) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law.
