Don't forget to tell Uncle Louie I left the red wine and Parmesan in the fridge. I love you. Bye-bye. - 'Bye, Judy. - Send me a picture. I'll be back soon. Don't worry about it. - Be careful, now. - 'Bye. - Take it easy, now. - 'Bye. "California, here we come" What's wrong? Don't you like my singing? I don't like the song. You're going to love California. You get up in the morning... ...roll out of bed, plop, in the pool. Yeah, sure. You'll see. This isn't exactly a dump we're moving to. Push, Daniel. Give it all you've got, kid. Push! Okay, we've got it. Come on. Get in, hurry up. We did it again. Way to go! Daniel, wake up. Look off the starboard bow. Paradise at last. We made it. Come on. This is it. This is the end of the line. You're telling me. Come on. All hands on deck. We've got to get this thing unloaded before it sinks. Look at those palm trees! Damn, do you know what that means? Yeah, watch out for falling coconuts. - Wise guy. No more Newark winters. - I like winters. Oh, you like sore throats? You like frozen toes? I don't like smog. - Did I tell you about the pool here? - About 100 times. Okay, so make it 101. Open your eyes, my darling son. This is the Garden of Eden. Come on. Listen, we're in apartment 20, okay? One flight up. - Are you okay? - Don't worry about it. - Let me help you up. - Thanks. I shouldn't have done that. It was stupid. You must be the new people in 20, right? Yeah, I guess so. - Freddy Fernandez, apartment 17. - Daniel LaRusso. How you doing? Let me help. - No, it's fine. It's heavy, man. - I got it. - Where are you from? - New Jersey. What are you doing out here? My mom got a job with some company out here. Rocket Computers. Flight of the Future. I don't know. - I never heard of it. - It's up and coming. - Is this the only pool you've got? - That's it. What was that, karate? - Yeah. - Have you been doing it long? - Yeah, a while. - Did you ever use it? - A couple of times. - I bet you could kick some ass. I'd like to learn that. Maybe you could teach me. - Sure. That's cool. Anytime. - Great. This place is a dump. You should go back to New Jersey. How did you know where I was from? 'Cause I'm from New Jersey. I got a nose for my own. - Well what part? - Parsippany. - I never should've left. - My Uncle Louie's from Parsippany. - Louie Martini? - Louie LaRusso. Louie LaRusso? Don't know him. Hey, pup. How you doing? You thirsty? - She's crazy. - What? - She's not playing with a full deck. - She's nice. - What are you doing tomorrow? - I don't know. I guess nothing. We're having a beach party. Want to come? - Sure, that's cool. - I'll come get you in the morning. Here's apartment 20. - Is it? - Should I leave this here? - Yeah, thanks for the help. - No problem. Nice meeting you. Take care. See you tomorrow morning. Don't say anything about the pool. I'll call first thing in the morning. Did you tell that old lady where we were from? Yes. Didn't she remind you of Aunt Tessy? - More like Uncle Louie. - I really think we're going to do good here. I have a very positive feeling. I'm telling you, Daniel. I just know it's going to work. The faucet's broken. The real estate lady said there's a fix-it guy. See if you can find him. What's that for? - Uncle Louie's dog. - He's cute. - I got invited to a party tomorrow. - Great. You see? - But you wanted me to help you unpack. - I don't remember saying that. I must have had you mixed up with somebody else. Thanks, Ma. Could you tell me where the maintenance guy is? Hey, pup. You go in through there, turn left, not too far... ...then right, go inside, and you'll find him on the left. So I go right then left? No, left then right, then inside on the left. Hello? Are you the maintenance man? We're the new people in apartment 20. The faucet's really leaking there. Could you come fix it? Can I tell my mom when? When what? When you're going to fix the faucet. After. After what? After after! Could we have the ball, please? Pretty good. Show-off. Sorry. Hey, wait up. - Who's that blonde in the blue? - The hills. - What's the hills? - Rich. - I think the blonde is looking at you. - Yeah, right. - I think she has the hots for you. - Who could blame her? - Why don't you make a move? - No, I'm eating, man. - How can you think about eating? - I'm hungry. - Maybe they ain't got no moves in Jersey. - I got moves where I come from. We've got more moves back there than here, I'll tell you that much. Let's see 'em. Come on, buddy. Go get her. I'm going. - Lose something? - I hope we're not bothering you. Hey, how do you juggle? It's pretty easy. You start on the knee. You just go one. One at a time. Then you try two. One, two. And then three and four. Try it. Just bring your leg up. Good! - That was awesome! - Brew time. Who's for a warm one? No, I pass. Who are you kidding? You're the ace degenerate. Ex-degenerate. Tomorrow I'm a senior. I've got one year to make it all work. And that's what I'm gonna do. Make it work, all of it. You must be a trendsetter, Johnny. Everyone's doing something new. Take a right. Check it out. - Forget it, man. It's ancient history. - Who told you, man? - I thought they broke up. - She did, he didn't. Come on, try it. Watch this. I'll get it. I'll be right back. - Ali, I want to talk to you. - Leave me alone. We've been over all this. I don't want to talk. I want to talk to you, all right? - What is your problem? - Just get out of here. - That won't solve anything. - Give me my radio. I said, give me my radio. - You promise you'll talk to me? - Yes, give me my radio. - You just broke my radio! - Yeah. Don't touch it, punk. - What's going on? - You want it? Johnny, stop it. - Stop it. - I didn't do anything. You're a big man now, huh? You started this. I just wanted to talk. - Leave him alone and we'll talk. - Where did I hear that before? How about you, hero? Had enough? - Now we're even. - No mercy, man. Why don't you hit me? - It's your fault! - It's not. - It's your fault. - Ever think it's yours? Why do you always have to fight? Bullshit. Get on your bikes, guys. You sure pick cool people to be friends with. Where'd you find this guy? Come on, let's go. He'll be all right. - Are you okay? - Just leave me alone. - I'll help you. - Leave me alone. I'm okay. Come on, Ali. Let's go. It's better if you leave him alone. Come on, let's go. Daniel! - How was the party? - It was okay. Must have been more than okay. I didn't hear you come in. - Any friend material? - Some. I got to go. - Eat first. - I'm not hungry. - You need energy to be charming. - I'm fine, I got energy. Do me a favour. Take off the glasses. - Why? - Because I asked you to. - It's California. It's the look. - I want to see your baby browns. - Come on with the baby browns. - Are you on something? - I'm on Minute Maid. - Why hide your eyes? - I'm not. - Take off the glasses. Now! My God! How did that happen? I hit a kerb with my bike. I wore the glasses so you wouldn't worry. - It looks worse than it feels. - Don't do that. - It doesn't hurt. - Can you see? You want to stay home? I've got to go. - Hey, you guys, Freddy, how you doing? - Hey, the karate kid. Let's see the moves. - He knows how to get his butt kicked. - I already know that move. Let's get out of here. Hey, think fast. - Hi. - Hi, how are you doing? - Your eye. - It looks worse than it feels. Believe me. I hope so. I never got a chance to thank you. That was nothing. I'm just sorry about your radio. I'm more sorry about your eye. You should've just given it to him. Why? It wasn't his, right? - Yeah, it wasn't his. - We think alike already. You know what else we do alike? You've been practicing. - Cheerleaders, over here. - I've got to go. - I'll see you. - 'Bye. - Hey, have you got a name? - Ali with an "i." - What's your name? - Daniel with an "I." I'll see you later. Definitely. Get him, Bobby. Have a nice trip? Look what he's doing to Bobby. Nobody hits me. I'm going to kill him. - None of that on this team! - He hooked me! I said out of here! Back to it. Let's go. This school sucks! It sucks. 52, 53, 54... 55, 56, 57... - Fix faucet. - Come on in. It's the kitchen one. 1, 2, 3... Karate. - Yeah, 5, 6... - Very good. - Learn from book? - And a few months at the Y in Newark. 9, 10... ...11, 12, 13... What happened to eye? I fell off my bike. Lucky no hurt hand. - Ali with an "i." How are you doing? - Good. - Not too hungry today? - Not really. Have some pie, I made it myself. - How do you like the valley? - It hasn't been dull. Was Newark dull? How did you know I was from there? - I asked. - Oh, really? - Are you sitting with anybody? - With you, if it's okay. - Sounds great to me. Want some milk? - Thanks. - Sorry about the soccer tryouts. - Those are the breaks. Remember that guy you had trouble with on the beach? - Yeah, King Karate? - He's my ex-boyfriend. That's good to know. What? Yeah, you're right. I know. - What are you doing? - It's this little voice... ...telling me I've got to be nuts to be talking to you. - That'll be $2.50. - For both. - $3.75. - It doesn't matter, anyway. - Why's that? - Because it's over. - Wait. How over? - Weeks. One week, five weeks? How many weeks is "weeks"? - Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it? - No, Sensei! - Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it? - No, Sensei! - Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it? - No, Sensei! - Fear does not exist in this dojo. Does it? - No, Sensei! - Pain does not exist in this dojo. Does it? - No, Sensei! - Defeat doesn't exist in this dojo. Does it? - No, Sensei! Prepare. - What do we study here? - The way of the fist, sir! - And what is that way? - Strike first, strike hard, no mercy! - I can't hear you. - Strike first, strike hard, no mercy! - Mr. Lawrence. - Yes, Sensei. Warm them up. Fighting positions. Jab punch. Ready. Guess what. I'm going to be trained as a manager. Isn't that great? The programme's two nights a week. As soon as a spot opens up, I'm in. The benefits are great. They pay for everything. That's great. - What's the matter, Daniel? - Nothing. Remember when you went to the country and hated it 'cause you had no friends? What happened? I got poison ivy. You met Kevin and Kenny, who became your best friends in the world. You've got to give it a try. I know it's hard. We're not quitters, are we? I guess not. - What's with the karate place? - It sucks. Good. We couldn't afford it anyway. And the girl situation? - It's okay. - Just okay? To me it looks like the whole world turned blonde. You got your eye on anybody? Cute? Not cute. - She's beyond cute. - But she's blonde, right? - She's got blonde hair. - Lucille, let's go, here they come. - Is she as pretty as Judy? - She buries Judy in a second. She buries Judy? Tell me about it later. I love you. Careful how you ride home. She's got an excellent smile. She's really smart. I'd say she's beautiful. I think she's beautiful. I think she's something else. She's hot. Definitely hot. - Looking for a shortcut to Newark? - He wants to learn karate. Here's the first lesson: How to take a fall. Don't think about the pain. Damn bike! I hate this bike! I hate this frigging bike! Stupid bike! What's the matter? Why did you throw your bike away? - Because I felt like it. - Look at me when I'm talking to you. My God! Tell me what's going on. Don't say another bike accident. - What do you want to hear? - The truth. No, all you want to hear is how great it is here. Maybe for you, but it sucks for me. I hate this place! I hate it, I want to go home! Why can't we just go back home? Listen to me. I cannot help you unless you tell me what's wrong. I've got to take karate. - You took karate. - Not at the Y, at a good school. - Fighting doesn't solve anything. - Neither does palm trees. That's not fair. It wasn't fair coming out here without asking me. You're right. I should've asked. I just want to go home. I don't understand the rules here. Let's see if we can figure out the rules together. - What about your bike? - It's safer taking the bus. Why can't we just go home and forget this place? - I'll tell you everything he said. - You'd better. How are you? - What happened to your forehead? - It's terrible. A gigantic runaway zit. That's gross. Daniel, this is Susan. What really happened? I got in a bike accident. What kind of bike do you have? A Honda? Suzuki? It's a Miyagi Turbo. - Yeah? - Oh, really? - We're going to the arcade. Want to come? - Sounds great. There's this new game I want to show you. I forgot something. I'll catch up with you guys in a minute. - Don't run away. - I'm not running away from anything. - We've got to deal with this. - I'll deal with it my own way. - Daniel... - Get off my case! Did you fix my bike? - Thank you. - You're welcome. I really appreciate that. Are those real trees? You like see, come inside. Thanks. How did they get so small? I train. Clip here, tie there. Did you learn this in Japan? Okinawa. Where's that? My country. China here. Japan here. Okinawa here. Did you go to school for this? Father teach. Was he a gardener? Fisherman. A fisherman. These are really beautiful. Come, you try. I don't know how to do this stuff. - Sit down. - I may mess it up or something. Close eyes. Trust. Concentrate. Think only tree. Make a perfect picture down to last pine needle. Wipe your mind clean. Everything but the tree. Nothing exists in whole world... ...only tree. You got it? Open eyes. Remember picture? Yeah. Make like picture. Just trust the picture. How do I know my picture's the right one? If come from inside you, always the right one. Hi. Hi, Ma, come on in. - You fixed your bike. - Mr. Miyagi fixed it. Great, thank you. - How much do we owe you? - No, please. My pleasure. That's very nice. Hi, champ. Hey. - What are you doing? - I'm trimming my baby tree. Bonsai tree. Bonsai tree. Bonsai. Bonsai. They're beautiful. Mr. Miyagi learned it in Okinawa. That's where he's from. Really? They're so delicate. For me? No, I couldn't. Please, hurt feelings. That's very nice, thank you. - Welcome. - I know just where it will go. Come on, it's getting late. - I'll be up in a half hour. - No, now. School tomorrow. - Thank you for everything. - You're welcome. Don't forget tree. Must practice. Thank you. - Sayonara. - Sayonara. - Goodnight. - Thanks again. See you. Ma, he gave you the nicest one. This guy is something else. You saw what he did to my bike. This guy is great. - Happy Halloween. You like? - Yeah, that's nice. Passed school today. Lots happening. What's the matter? You're not going? No. How come? I'm not into dancing that much. I don't feel like it, anyway. You're too much by self. Not good. I'm not by myself. I'm with you. To make honey, young bee need young flower, not old prune. I don't have a costume, anyway. If have costume... ...you go? If I went as the Invisible Man. Invisible Man? You know, so no one would see me. There's Daniel. - Where? - In the shower. - How do you know? - I just know. May I? - I don't know what she sees in him. - She must be into fungus. Help me, my flower needs water. You've come to the right place, stranger. - I've never danced in a shower. - A friend of mine made this for me. Isn't it great? Where have you been hiding? I haven't been hiding. - I haven't seen you around. - You been looking? - Sort of. - Sort of? I thought you were still angry with me. - Why? - Because of what I said last time I saw you. I've been thinking a lot about that. I should learn to mind my own business. No, I think you're right about facing things. I feel the same way. I just kind of forgot for a while. - Thanks for reminding me. - You're welcome. He thinks he can do whatever he wants to people. - Who? - Johnny. I'd love to see him get some of his own medicine. What goes around comes around. - I'd love to be there when it does. - Me, too. You want to go outside? You talked me into it. - That chicken is wild! - That guy's using real eggs! He's great! No! Johnny! Johnny! - Got that number rolled? - In a minute. I'm going to get the guys. Hurry up. Shit! Move, man! Johnny, what's up? Get out of my way! - What's wrong? - It's coming around. Get up! Get out of my way! What the hell are you doing? Get out of the way! You ain't going nowhere. You little wimp! You couldn't leave well enough alone, could you, little twerp? No, you had to push it. Well, now you're gonna pay! Where are you going, sweetheart? How about a front kick, Johnny? Get him up. - He's had enough. - Shut up! - He can't even stand up. - That don't mean squat. - Johnny, he's had enough. - I'll decide when he's had enough. What's wrong with you, Johnny? - An enemy deserves no mercy. - Right! You're crazy, man! Get him! Daniel-san. Come. Leave on. - It stinks. What is it? - Smell bad, heal good. - Where did Spider-Man go? - Who? The guy who bailed me out. Where'd he go? What, you? - No way. - Why "no way"? - Because... - Because, old man? Have tea. Feel better. Why didn't you tell me? - Tell you what? - That you do karate. - You never ask. - Where'd you learn it? Father. I thought he was a fisherman. In Okinawa, all Miyagi know two things: Fish and karate. Karate come from China, 16th century. Called "te," hand. Much later... ...Miyagi ancestors call "karate," empty hand. I always thought it came from Buddhist temples. You, too much TV. That's what my mother tells me. - Have you ever taught anyone? - No. Would you? - It depend. - On what? Reason. How's revenge? You look for revenge that way, start by digging two graves. At least I'd have company, right? Fighting always last answer to problem. Mr. Miyagi, I don't think you understand my problem. Miyagi understand problem perfect. Your friend all karate student? Friends? Yeah, those guys. Problem attitude. The problem is I keep getting my ass kicked. Because boys have bad attitude. Karate for defence only. That's not what these guys are taught. I can see. No such thing bad student, only bad teacher. Teacher say, student do. Great, that solves everything. I'll go to the school and straighten it out with the teacher. Now use head for something other than target. - I was only kidding. - Why kidding? I get killed if I show up there. Get killed anyway. Would you go with me? No, I can't. Why? You said it was a good idea. For you, good idea. For me, good idea no get involved. But you're already involved. - Very sorry. - What? Thanks for nothing then. Like I didn't have enough problems already. Now I've got to carry your weight, too. Don't do me any more favours. - Daniel-san. - What? Okay, I go. - Excellent, Mr. Miyagi. - Miyagi. Miyagi. What kind of belt do you have? Canvas. You like? J.C. Penney. $3.98. I meant... In Okinawa a belt means no need rope hold up pants. That's funny. - Daniel-san. - What? Karate here. Karate here. Karate never here. You understand? I think so. Goodnight, Daniel-san. Goodnight, Mr. Miyagi. Miyagi! Tomorrow morning? 10:00. Thanks for helping me out with my friends out there. - Good morning, Mr. Miyagi. - How do you feel? - A little sore. - You know how drive? Yeah, I do. - No, I'm not very good at it. - Me neither. I don't have a licence. Me neither. I guess it's okay then. You lose concentration in a fight and you're dead meat! - Yes, Sensei. - What? Yes, Sensei! Get up! Give me 60 pushups on your knuckles. Combat! Brown. Robertson. On guard. Point. Round kick. What are you looking at? Finish him! Return. Prepare. We do not train to be merciful, here. Mercy is for the weak. Here, on the street, in competition... ...a man confronts you, he is the enemy. An enemy deserves no mercy. What is the problem, Mr. Lawrence? Come on, let's forget this. Wait, not yet. Class, we have visitors. Fall in behind me. I hear you jumped some of my students last night. Afraid the facts mixed up. Are you calling him a liar? No call no one nothing. What are you here for, old man? Come ask leave boy alone. Can't the boy take care of himself? One-to-one problem, yes. Five-to-one problem, too much ask anyone. Is that what's bothering you, the odds? Well, we can fix that. - Feel like matching, Mr. Lawrence? - Yes, Sensei! No more fighting. This is a karate dojo, not a knitting class. You don't come in here, drop a challenge and leave, old man. You get your boy on the mat, or you and I will have a problem. Too much advantage, your dojo. Name a place. Tournament. You've got real nerve, old man. But I think we can accommodate you. Can't we, Mr. Lawrence? Yes, Sensei. Fall in. Ask one more small request. Make it fast. Ask leave boy alone to train. You're a pushy little bastard, ain't you? But I like that. No one touches the prima donna until the tournament. - Is that understood? - Yes, Sensei! But if you don't show... ...then it's open season... ...on him... ...and you. I can't believe this. - I cannot believe this! - What? What you just got me into. You said you'd make things better. - I did. - How? How? I saved you two months of beating. Great, now I've got something to look forward to. How much further is your house? Other side tracks. Are you in the oil business, too? Not everything is as seem. Reminds me of Newark. What are we going to do here? Start training. Much work be done. Tournament here before you know it. That's what I'm afraid of. That teacher was really wacko. You really think I can beat that guy? No matter. Wacko teacher attitude rest in fist. Stupid, but fact of life. Win, lose, no matter. You make good fight, earn respect. - Then nobody bother. - They'll bury me where I fall. Either way, problem solved. Wait right here. This is great. - I forgot to give you this back. - You keep. Thanks a lot. - Ready? - Yeah, I guess so. Daniel-san, must talk. Walk on road. Walk right side, safe. Walk left side, safe. Walk middle, sooner or later, you get squished just like grape. Here, karate same thing. Either you karate do, yes, or karate do, no. You karate do, "guess so," just like grape. Understand? Yeah, I understand. Ready? Yeah, I'm ready. Yes. First make sacred pact. I promise teach karate. That's my part. You promise learn. I say, you do, no questions. That's your part. Deal? It's a deal. First wash all the cars, then wax. - Why do I have to... - Remember deal. No questions. Yeah, but... Wax on right hand. Wax off left hand. Wax on, wax off. Breathe in through nose, out through mouth. Wax on, wax off. Don't forget to breathe. Very important. Wax on, wax off. Wax on, wax off. Where did these cars come from? Detroit. Wax on... ...right hand make circle. Wax off, left hand make circle. Wax on, wax off. Breathe in, breathe out. Wax on, wax off. Mr. Miyagi, I'm finished. You want to check these out? Mr. Miyagi? Mr. Miyagi? Hello? I've been looking all over for you. Where've you been? - I don't believe it. - What? - Where are you going? - I'm going to find that idiot. - No, it's been taken care of. - Until next time. - There isn't going to be a "next time." - There they are. Watch this. Hey, guys, it's good to see you. Sorry about your eye, Johnny. Your shoulder okay, Tommy? You guys be careful not to step in front of any more buses. Hold it. Remember what Sensei said? Wait for the tournament. It must be "Take a Worm for a Walk" week. You did all that damage? When you make a wish in the shower, it always comes true. - I should have kept my mouth shut. - No, we've got an agreement. Yeah? What's that? They agreed not to beat up on me and I promised not to bleed on them. - I don't believe you. - What can I do, moan and groan? - Anybody else would. - Who'd listen anyway? Me. Really? - You feel like listening on Saturday night? - Sure. Great! So Saturday night... ...we'll go out, we'll have a good time. We'll do whatever. - Is that your address? - You got it. Where is this? - I've got to go. - Okay. I'll talk to you later. Great. All right. Mr. Harris, can I talk to you? LaRusso. Third period history class. I wanted to tell you, I really got a lot out of that lecture about the Indians.
