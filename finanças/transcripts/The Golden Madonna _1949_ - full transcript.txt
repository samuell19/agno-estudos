[MUSIC PLAYING] [DRUMS RUMBLING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DRUMS RUMBLING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [THEME MUSIC] [FRENCH HORN FLOURISH] [TRUMPET FLOURISH] [FRENCH HORN FLOURISH] [TRUMPET FLOURISH] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [FRENCH HORN FLOURISH] [TRUMPET FLOURISH] [FRENCH HORN FLOURISH] [TRUMPET FLOURISH] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] And William? And William? Put it down. Hmm? Put it down! [CRASHING] Now, come with me. Come with me. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] I told you, I want all this cleared away. Take it outside and burn it. Burn it. And this, and all this. What's this supposed to be, the laughing cavalier? So [INAUDIBLE]. This can go, too. Burn it. The villa is so beautiful, but all this is dreadful. Make a lovely bonfire of it. Maria. Maria! Maria? Maria! Burn it. Not here, you idiot! You'll set the whole place on fire. Look. Look. Now. [CRASHING] There. [CRASHING] Maria. Maria, will you please explain to Antonio that I want all the rubbish in there taken out into the yard and burned? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I understand everything. Maria? I must have a bath. You had a bath yesterday. Yes, I know. And I'm going to have one today, too. I'm going to have a bath every day. Not possible. We have no water. Water only at night. But the pump. Somebody can fetch it up from the pump. It's too far. And who brings the water? [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] Ah. You're Don Vicenzo, aren't you? Yes. I'm so glad to see you. Oh, thank you. Forgive, Signorina Contessa, coming only today to greet you. Yesterday, I was with sick people. Do sit down, won't you? Thank you. I'm sorry I'm so untidy. I've been trying to get the place cleaned up a bit. As I always say to my children, a house is as dirty as it's dirtiest corner. Oh, it's all right, Antonio. You can leave that. Do it later. So the Signorina, excuse, the Signora, is married? Good heavens, no. But your children? Oh, I mean my school children. When I got my demob from the Navy, I had a job as a schoolteacher. That explains it. [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] It seems almost like a fairy tale. I'd forgotten we had an Italian branch to our family. And now, all this is mine. The Signorina intends to stay for some time? I intend to live here, to make it my home. Forgive me, but on what will you live? On the income from the estate, I hope. There is no income from the estate. Have the lawyers not told you? But I expect that's because there's been nobody here to manage things properly. Look again at the earth. For over a year, we have had no rain. The crops have been ruined. Many cattle have died. The peasants begin to despair. So that's why they're so sullen and depressed. I thought they hated me on sight. Poor things, can nothing be done for them? Nothing, unless you can find the Golden Madonna. The Golden Madonna? What has that to do with rain? It is difficult to understand. For centuries now, the picture of the Madonna has hung in our church. And whenever a disaster has struck our village, the peasants had turned to her for help. And the little piece of painted wood always produced a miracle. Not the painting, their faith. Before, when the Madonna refused to listen, eh, it was always their fault. The Madonna refused to listen because they had been avaricious, drunk, crazy, lustful, violent. But now, they blame everything on one man, the man who stole the Madonna. You know who stole it? No one knows. During the war, it was moved from the church and hidden in the villa for greater safety. Then, one night, it disappeared. Many strange things happened that night. The German soldiers retreat. Your uncle, the old count, died. And the English officer disappeared. Which English officer? A parachutist. He was wounded when he escaped from the Germans. We hid him and nursed him back to health. He became one of us. Everybody liked him. Where is he now? I do not know. Two or three years ago, he wrote from Burma that he will come back when he can. The whole village still waits for him. That explains it. This arrived yesterday. Get out the chessmen and the vintage. Stop. Burma's GHQ champion will give you another chance Thursday afternoon. Stop. Cheerio. Mike. [GASPING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Don Vicenzo! Don Vicenzo? Don Vicenzo? [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Capitano Christie? [BRAKES SCREECHING] Capitano Christie? Capitano Christie? Capitano Christie? Capitano Christie? Capitano Christie? Capi-- My luggage arrived this morning. What about your capitano? I don't understand. Capitano Christie always kept his word. I don't understand. Never mind, there are plenty of other trains. Would you ask him to send my luggage up today? Yes, yes, of course. I don't understand. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR HORN HONKING] [COUGHING] Road hog. [SIGHING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Capitano Christie! Capitano Christie! [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Capitano Christie! Hello. Hello. Who are you? A guest. That's interesting. Yes, isn't it? By the way who are you? Your hostess. Next time you pass a pony cart on the road, perhaps you'll have the good manners to slow down. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. You're Captain Christie, aren't you? Ex-Captain. How do you do? I'm Patricia Chandler, the English part of the family. They call me Contessa, here. How do you do, Contessa? Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm very hungry. Did you know the Count? No, I never met him. He was a very distant relative. He was very kind to me in those difficult days. Poor old fellow. He firmly believed that the Eighth Army had nothing better to do in this country than to liberate him. I owed him another game of chess, too. He lost the last. Why didn't you come back before? Burma took two years. I spent another trying to get them mobilized, and a fourth year trying to get a job. This is really my first chance. Now, it's too late. El Capitano? The bath is ready. Grazia, Maria. I'm sorry, will you excuse me? Wait a minute. You can't possibly have a bath now, Captain Christie. The whole village is waiting to see you. After waiting four years, they can wait 10 more minutes. Oh, Don Vicenzo was desperate to see you. You can't disappoint them all now, Captain Christie. Well, I-- Besides, if anybody's going to have a bath, I am. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Capitano Christie. At last. Prodigal son. [LAUGHTER] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I wish you could have seen Don Vicenzo during the war with his cassock stuffed with hand-grenades and bread. And every night, I learned 10 words of English. Brand gun, cricket, double your quids, blimey. Forgive me, Contessa, but the whole village is expecting the Capitano to speak. They want to know from you where is the Golden Madonna? What you mean? What happened to it? It was stolen. That's impossible. Yes. It is perfectly possible. It disappeared completely. I see. Will you tell them all that the Golden Madonna was not stolen? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] OK, if I speak them in English, will you translate a few words for me? Blimey, yes. I understand your anxiety because I know what the Golden Madonna meant to you, but I have good news for you. The Count Benetti was afraid of the retreating Germans and wanted to put the Madonna in a safe place. He asked me to help him, and I did. Now, I can tell you that the Madonna is in the villa. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] The Madonna's not in the villa. Madonna is in the villa. Do be sensible. It's not in the villa. I've had the whole place upside down. There's no sign of a Madonna. Don't worry. It's there, all right, and you wouldn't recognize it. It was camouflaged. Camouflaged? How? There's another picture over it. It was, uh, my idea. I painted it with my own hand. Which picture did you paint over it with your own hands? The Laughing Cavalier. What happened to it? I threw it on the fire. [CHEERING] Father, please, listen-- Are you crazy? What are you going to do? Tell them you burned the Madonna? After all that excitement, they'll tear you to bits. Perhaps-- Perhaps what? Come on! Perhaps they haven't burned it yet? Anyway-- [ENGINE ROARING] Don Vicenzo! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [BELL TOLLING] [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [SIGHING] For the first time, Antonio's actually done what I asked him to do. I'm sorry. But only a complete idiot would throw a picture of a bonfire. A picture! I never saw such a travesty in my life. It was horrible. I never pretended to be Michelangelo. It wasn't meant to be a masterpiece. I've no doubt you did your best. Haven't you the sense to realize that if I'd painted a masterpiece, it would have ended up in the private collection of a German officer? I painted it that way on purpose! And I threw it away on purpose because I loathed sight of it! Now, I know why. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHATTERING] [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Don Vicenzo. Yes, my son. My dear Don Vicenzo, and all of you whom I love so much and it makes me so happy to see you again. Where is it, the Madonna? That's it. Well, what I mean to say is this whole affair is not quite as simple as I thought. So now you can translate. Oh, my son, I cannot translate that. Antonio. You haven't burned everything? The picture. The picture that was hanging on the wall that I gave you to burn, The Laughing Cavalier, he's got a big mustache. And he's smiling like this. With a big-- oh, Maria. Maria, the picture. The picture that I gave you to burn, The Laughing Cavalier, that beautiful picture, have you burned it? No, we no burned it. Where is it? I thought you said to burn it. Where is it? I did not mean to do wrong. Where is it? Came Esposito [SPEAKING ITALIAN],, how you say, junk merchant from Naples. He gave me 500 lira this morning. You said to burn it. You sold it? Si, Signora. Maria, you darling lovely woman. You sold it. To whom? I told you. Esposito. He went away 10 minutes ago in small little cart. Where to? In Napoli. Naples, where? Vico Sant'Antonio 3. Oh! Thank you, Maria. Thank you. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Just a minute. Maria! What did you tell the Contessa? Where is the picture? She wasn't cross. She kissed me. I'll kiss you, too. Now, what happened to the picture? Esposito from Naples bought it, and I tell to the Contessa. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] When is the Feast of the Madonna? In three days. All right, in three days, the Madonna will be in its right place above the altar. I give my word for it. Can you translate that? Oh, yes, my son. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Can you get me some petrol, Maria? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I've got to have it. [CHEERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR HORN HONKING] [TRUMPETS FLOURISH] Vico Sant'Antonio 3, Mr. Esposito. Does anybody know the Esposito shop? You? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [MUSIC PLAYING] John, John! Come! Come down! Skip it, chum. Jack, beautiful girl. English. English, heh. Not interested. Beautiful. Rich. Heh, 35 pounds in her pocket. Not interested! Big car. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Chauffeur. All right. OK. Let's see. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN ITALIAN] Mr. Esposito? [BELL RINGING] Anybody here? Eh? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Signora. Do you speak English? At your service, Madame. I believe you were at the Benetti Villa, yesterday. Benetti Villa? You said yesterday? Yes, yesterday. They sold you a picture by mistake. A picture? Yesterday? What sort of a picture? Oh, it was quite worthless, just a very bad copy of a famous picture called The Laughing Cavalier. Ah, The Laughing Cavalier, hey? I don't remember. No. But it is not impossible. In any case, what can I do for you? I want to buy it back. You see, it has a sort of sentimental value. It's a souvenir. I need it. Yes, well, well, well. I will see what I can do. Now, please, at once. I'll wait for it. I understand. I will talk to my assistant. He may know something of it. Just a moment. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DRUMS RUMBLING] [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Copy this one. You have an hour, no more. Now I understand everything. I am very sorry, Madame. We have already sold the picture. Sold it, already? It's only 9:00. We| open at seven. Well, who bought it? Good day. Good day. Mr. Lester, perhaps you could-- Oh, never mind. I'm quite happy. I beg your pardon, Madame, what were you asking? Well, who bought the picture? Surely, you can buy it back. Surely. In any case, we will try. I'm quite willing to pay. How much? Well, let me see. You'll gave 500 for it. This is not important now. You see, the picture it does not belong to me anymore. I only remember that the buyer like it very much. Certainly, he will ask more for it. I don't know how much, but certainly more. If you want that I take it back, you must tell me how far I can go. Well, to be perfectly frank, I-- Ah, ah! Mr. Lester, I don't want to waste your time. What can I do for you? No, no, go on. I have plenty of time. Well, well Signora? I'll beg your pardon, Madame. I see you're a compatriot of mine. My name is Lester, John C. Lester. If I can be of any help here. Thank you very much. I can manage quite well. I doubt it, Madame. I don't think we need Mr. Lester's help. Oh, you know who bought the picture then? Eh, not exactly. There you are. You see, that's where I can be of some help. The man's right about one thing. We must know how much you're prepared to pay for the picture. Well, I have with me-- if it's absolutely necessary-- 60,000 lira. Very well. Very well. Perhaps Signora could come back tomorrow. Oh no. No, that's much too late. It's very urgent. I must have it today. In that case, come back at midday, eh? Oh. Thank you. Good day. May I show you the way? Hey, did you realize it? What? He was trying to double-cross you. I think I'd better go back and have a little talk with him, in private. Hey, Pippo. [WHISTLING] Well, I'll be back in a minute. Keep your eye on the Signorina. See that the kids don't annoy her. Come on, speak up. What's it all about? It is none of your business. It's our common business. Why come on? Why come on? You think you can still poke your nose in everything? Look, Johnny, you are a washout. Your time [WHISTLING] is over. This has nothing to do with your black marketing. This is a perfect legal business and you are not in it. Listen, I know what's over and what's not over. Well, I wouldn't be wasting my time on a miserable chickenfeed of 30,000 liras. 30,000? Why 30,000? Half of 60 is 30, isn't it? Eh, what do you mean half? Why half? Well, what would you do, for instance, if this lady were to bring along a couple of cops? Cops? Yes, cops. Policemen. Ah, she would never do a thing like that, heh, unless you suggested it. There you are. You see, that's what costs 30,000. Ah. All right, give me $30,000, I will give you the picture. Oh that's fine, only I'm afraid you've made a slight error in timing, chum. First, you give me the picture, then I'll give you the 30,000. That is what I meant. Good. You get the picture, then. In an hour. At least, I hope so. I hope so, too. Goodbye. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Everything's under control. Just come along with me. Hey, Pippo. [WHISTLING] Ha, Mr. Migone. Heh, good morning. Good morning, sir, Esposito. Sorry to disturb you, but I have found something magnificent for you. Ah, you're going to embrace me for it. Ha ha, a masterpiece. What it represents? Ha ha ha, it is going to be a surprise. I will bring it to you in an hour and a half. Eh. Eh. Thank you. Thank you, sir. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Just an omelette. An omelette? And to drink, [INAUDIBLE],, coffee? I'll have a bottle of mineral water. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Pat. Hello, Michael. Good morning, sir. We have very nice hors d'oeuvre, lobster, oysters, Spaghetti with Vongole. Bring me the same as the lady, please. And to drink? Also the same as the lady, sir? No, no. A small bottle of mineral water. Why did you come to Naples? Because I promised to help you. You're too late. I found the Golden Madonna. All right. If you don't believe me, I'll show it to you. You mean, it's really true? You've got it? Where? Somebody's bringing it here. Oh, I see. A Neapolitan promised to find it for you? An English gentleman who lives in Naples. An English gentleman who lives in Naples is either not English or not a gentleman. What's the good of arguing about it? It'll be here in half an hour. Poor little optimist. I wish you'd stop interfering in my affairs. Please, leave me alone. [MUSIC PLAYING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Ah. Ah, is that e picture? Ooh, it's really beautiful. Shall we wrap it up? Yes. Now, you give me 30,000. Certainly, after I get the 60. OK. You are not to take the picture out of here until you pay the money. Really? [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Good day, Contessa. At last. Oh, may I introduce Captain Christie? How do you do? Haven't we met before, somewhere? No, I'm afraid not. Well-- [SINGING IN ITALIAN] Would you mind, just a moment? I'm awfully sorry. It's business. Not at all. Well? There is a slight snag. Why? Couldn't you get it? Oh, I've got it, but-- You've got it. Thank goodness. And where's the snag? They're asking more money for it. How much? Half a million. How much? Half a million. You see, they're a bunch of crooks. The heard someone was after the picture, and they bid against each other for it. That's impossible. Don't think I'm on make. My only aim is to give a helping hand. But at least, you know the man who's really got the picture? I've seen it. Then I'll the money. Good, everything's all right, then. We meet in exactly an hour at the Galleria, shall we say? Anyone could tell you where to find it. It's quite easy. You'll bring the money and I'll, well, the actual buyer himself will bring the picture. I'm afraid I'm rather busy, myself, this afternoon. How will I recognize him? Don't worry about that. He'll recognize you, all right. There is one thing. I think you better go alone. Oh, but I must take-- No, no, don't. It'd be a mistake because he looks like a detective. My friend is, well, rather-- how shall I put it-- rather sensitive. He might run away. All right, I'll go alone. Good. Good. That's all right, then, in exactly an hour at the Galleria. I'll be there. Thank you very much. No, not at all. Only too glad to help a compatriot. He heh. [WHISTLING] Weren't you with the paratroops during the war? No, submarines. Sure I've met you before, somehow? No, sir. Not me. Goodbye. Was that the English gentleman you met in Naples? Yes. I can't see the picture. There's a little snag. What is the snag? They want half a million for it. Half a million! It's outrageous, impossible. What's so impossible about it. It only sounds a lot. How much is it in English money? 250 pounds. There, you see. It doesn't sounds bad as half a million. Have you got 250 pounds? No. Then let's talk in lira. Are you certain the Madonna is there? Absolutely certain? Absolutely. Then we'll get the money. Yes. Let's see how much money we've got. I have 20, 22, 23,000 lira. Well, what happened to the rest of your 35 pounds? You only arrived yesterday. 18,000 for the repair of the engine. And I had to feed the car, and myself, coming from England. Right, 23,000 and my 60,000. What else? What else? Your car? GB number, no good. But the radio-- Splendid! How much? 5,000. 23,000 and 5,000. That's 28,000. And 60,000, we've got 88,000 lira. All we want now is 412,000 lira. Half an hour. Is that Swiss? It was a present on my 10th birthday. What about your next year's crops? What crops? Well, whatever it is you grow on your estate. No rain. No crops? I must have a few Swiss francs left over. What's that? Careful, it's full of powder. It's my uncle's snuff box. Is that a real diamond? I don't know. If that's real, it's worth 10 million. Believe me, at least 10 million. I'm an expert. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREECHING] It's real. I'm a millionaire! 338, 339, 340. 10 million, fine expert. Something must have happened to the diamond market. I had a friend in Amsterdam, and he-- We've got 428,000 lira, with or without Amsterdam. It's not enough. Well, I'll have to show them it is enough. You can't. I've got to go alone. That's what you think. Why? Well, you see, somehow, you look like a detective. A detective? Yes. These people are awfully sensitive. I'm warning you. This place is like a jungle. You don't know Naples. You can't speak Italian. And I couldn't handle the Neapolitans, anyway. Oh Michael, please believe me. I can look after myself. I've done pretty well up till now, haven't I? I suppose so. How am I going to carry it? I have to make a parcel of it for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Migone is waiting for me. [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Good morning. Are you the English lady? Yes. Come along. Come on. Will you just wait here a minute? I'll be right back. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [WHISTLING] [ARGUING IN ITALIAN] [WHISTLING] [ARGUING IN ITALIAN] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [SHRIEKING] Ah! [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [TENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Chin up, Pat. [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Ah! You were quite right. Jungle? Jungle. I've been such a fool. Yes. Thank you for your sympathy. Well, that finishes everything. I said, chin up, Pat. There was no money in that parcel. Only paper. You-- you-- Yes, I am. Look out! Marco! Eh, she's arrived. Good. Here you are, chum. OK. Here, keep it safe, this time. No. No, never again. You keep it. So you do need my help? Yes. Then you do-- Yes. You've been right about everything. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Mama! Where are we going? Who cares? But the picture, they'll be waiting for me. You run along. No. Don't worry. I'll be around. Thank you, Michael. And the money? Of course. [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Money, where is my money? Money! Look. Oh! Mama! Hello, here is the picture. What's wrong? Here is the picture. Here's the picture. It's The Laughing Cavalier. I haven't got the half a million liras. You got no money? Well, how much you got? Nothing. Swiss? Yes. Well, give me that. OK. Goodbye. Michael! [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Michael, Michael! Michael! Pat! Pat! What? What is it? Michael, the picture. I've got it back. The Madonna. It's really a beautiful picture. Don't get sentimental. You have to. No, you take it. Just imagine the village. You walking into the church, bringing back the Madonna. If anybody's going to take it back, you are. After all, you've done everything. Nonsense. You're taking it. Don't bully me. I insist upon your taking it. Neither of us is taking it. Why? Because it's a fake! What? This isn't the picture I painted. Look, there's nothing underneath this one. Michael, this is terrible. The dirty rats. Now, what are we going to do? Don't worry, Pat. It'll be all right. We haven't any money. We haven't even enough-- We don't need any money. This time, we're going to use our wits. Now listen carefully, whoever made this fake had to copy it. So he must have the original. Yes. Yes, of course. Where did you first meet Mr. John C. Lester and the rest of his gang? In the Esposito shop in Vico Sant'Antonio 3. Good. You're going back there, only this time you're going to be a very rich English lady who is slightly crazy. Let them think you've got millions and millions of pounds on you. Use your wits. If they know you're willing to pay anything they ask for the original, it'll appear like magic. Yes. Yes, of course. Let's go. No, Darling. This time, you're going alone. Alone? Yes. My part starts when they produce the picture. Then, I'll be there. Waiter, taxi. Yes. I haven't any money. You're a millionaire. Right. I'll use my wits. Liar, liar! She gave you 60,000. She didn't give me a penny. It is not true! She gave me only this watch. That watch is-- Ah! And what about to my overheads? I paid 500 to begin with. Your miserable 500. And what about my expenses? And how's Goliath going to be paid? What I'll do? Leave me out? What happen if she brings police I took all the risk. Give me the watch. Ah, ah? And me, and me, and me. You arrange this, eh? With not me. You belong to him. And you want to charge your miserable 500. Such a shame. You've all taken so much trouble. But unfortunately, this picture's a fake. It's the picture from the Villa Benetti that I want. I happen to be a very rich woman. And, well, I don't mind how much I pay for it. If you want 10 million, 20 million, even a hundred million, I'll pay. Of course, I may seem a little mad, but pictures happen to be my greatest interest in life. I'll, I'll pay 10 million, 20 million, anything. 10 million. 20 million. [SOBBING] I must have the picture. I can't leave without it. It's not The Laughing Cavalier that was just painted over. It's a Madonna, the Golden Madonna. It was hanging in the little church in the village and they're waiting for it. Don't you understand? They're waiting for it. For two years, there's been no rain, and all because the Madonna wasn't in her proper place above the altar. You can't take people's faith away. It's the only thing they have left, now. I haven't any money. I've lost everything. If I go back empty-handed without the Madonna, there'll be no rain, and they won't be happy. they can't be happy without the Madonna. Please, let me take her home again. [SAD VIOLIN MUSIC] No. [SOBBING] Yes, Signorina. You will get the Madonna. I swear it. You promised that before. Well, this time I swear it. I swear it on Sant Gennaro that you will get it back. Where can we find you? I shall go back to the cafe on the Santa Lucia. Yes. You will have an hour near to there. I believe you. I don't know why, but I believe in you. And may I add that if anyone tries to cheat my compatriot, I'll kill him. What has a compatriot got to do with it? The village needs the rain. Do you mean to say a picture can bring rain? Of course there is going to be rain, you idiot. Might be. I'm not an expert in these matters. But I am! [TELEPHONE DIALING] Ah, Mr. Migone. Ah, mm-hmm. This is Esposito. About the picture I sold you this morning. There had been a mistake. Heh. What? Oh! You will bring? No, it's not possible. I come. I come to you right away. Just a minute! Mr. Migone! Me-- He is leaving. When? Now. Where to? I don't know! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Get out. How many kids have you got? All Naples. Very well then, go to it. I want Migone Villa surrounded. I want his trail followed step-by-step, understood? Yes, sir. Right, forward march. Follow me? Eh. Eh. Well, what happened? Everything's going all right. We shall get it back. I knew I was right. Yes, Michael, you were quite right. Why is your nose so red? Red? I'm afraid I've been crying. Why? I couldn't keep it up. I couldn't lie any longer. What do you mean? I told them the truth. The truth! I told them we had no money. I told them everything. Oh, please, you invariably do exactly the opposite. Oh, Michael, you must believe me. It was the right thing to do. Trusting a gang of crooks? Oh, you're wrong. I've never been so sure, so absolutely sure. That's wonderful. They promised me. Who? Well, everybody. The Esposito, Mr. Lester-- The English gentleman from Naples? If I ever meet him again, I'll-- Oh, Michael, you're wrong. They may have cheated us, but they are honest and good people. Perfect. Naples is a kind and honest city. Yes, Naples is a lovely city. All right, right. Let's go. It's hopeless waiting here. Have you any? My watch? He's given me back my watch. There, you see. All right, so we hang that on the altar instead of the Madonna. I'm going to fetch the car. We're going home. No, but you must wait. They're bringing the Madonna here. They can send it by post. We go home! [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [WHISTLING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [TIRES SCREECHING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Come, come. [INAUDIBLE] Come! No, I can't. I'm waiting for someone. You can't wait, now! The boat leaves in three minutes. The boat? Where to? Capri. You leave for Capri. I can't go to Capri alone. Oh, I'm coming with you. Yes. We're going to get the picture. Eh. Come on! Come! Woolly bully! [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Oh! Woo hoo! Over here, hey. Hold your bag. Me, too. [CHATTERING] The picture's in that suitcase. That's the man we want. Who is he? Julian Migone. What does he do? Oh, about the same as I do. He's an art collector. The only difference, is he's already made his pile. Got a villa in Capri, one in Naples, and a third one in Chicago. What'll we do now? First of all, you've got to get acquainted, see. But how? Will I just go up to him and say, how you do? Don't jump your fences. You've got to use finesse. Just walk by and drop your handkerchief. Isn't that a little old-fashioned? Maybe it is, but if my mother hadn't dropped her handkerchief on Brighton Pier in front of my father, I wouldn't be here now. See? I see. Perhaps it is oldster. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, forward march. [FOGHORN] [MUSIC PLAYING] Oh, allow me. Oh, thank you so much that is nice of you. Oh, it was a pleasure. It's a dreadful habit of mine. I'm always losing my hankie. A very charming custom. It gives one a chance to be of help. Be that a little later. Oh, well, anyway, thank you very much. But please, don't mention it. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] You Capitano Christie? Yes. Signorina went to Capri. She returns tomorrow. Capri? She went to Capri? Who with? With my friend, English Johnny. When is the next boat for Capri? 5 o'clock. At 5:00? I'm sorry, I can't tip you. I haven't any money. No money? Not a penny. I will pay. You'll buy me a ticket to Capri? Yes. And you are from Naples? Yes. It's a great city. What's your name? Pippo. Pippo, can I have a sandwich? Yes, Capitano. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What did you say? That you must have the most beautiful room in the hotel with a private terrace. Really, you shouldn't bother. Anything will do. Thanks, awfully. Please, don't even mention it. I'm only anxious you should enjoy your stay on this enchanting island. Is it all right? I have a perfect room for the lady. Thank you. Perhaps we see each other tomorrow morning at the Faraglioni? What is the Faraglioni? Rocks. Two rocks. How shall I find them? It's easy. They are rather tall, 500 feet each. Goodbye. Apartment 22. May I show you the way, Countess? Yes, but just a minute. I'll be back in a second. Hey, hey, Countess. Hey! Countess, where are you going? Out of here. Now, what's the matter? I can't stay here. It's impossible. Take it easy. You can't back out now. How can I pay? Listen, the Countess Benetti can't live anywhere else. I don't want to stay in that hotel, I don't want to go to the beach, and I don't want to see that man again. But you do want the picture back, don't you? Yes. Well, I'm going to need your help to get it. I'm perfectly willing to help in a way that I can, but what can I do? Oh, nothing. You've got me, haven't you? Johnny-- Listen, did I cheat you? Answer me frankly, yes or no? Well, to be perfectly frank, Johnny, yes you did cheat me. Then, trust me, I can cheat him too. I assure you, what I'm going to do is strictly illegal. Do you mean? You're going to steal it? No, Countess, how can you use such an ugly word? Aren't we going to restore the picture to its rightful owners? Yes. To the village. Then we're through with diplomacy. Tomorrow morning, you go down to the beach. Right? Right. And you stick by him day and ni-- well, until I get my opportunity. I haven't any clothes, not even a bathing costume. Buy one. Without money? Certainly. Here, I'll show you how it's done. Come on. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Is there anything more I can do for you, Countess? That'll be all, James. You may go. Very well, I'll be at the [INAUDIBLE] in the morning. Good evening, Countess. [SPEAKING FRENCH] Capri, Contessa. Just arrived, I believe? May I help you in some way? Thank you, I just need a simple bathing suit. Of course, a nice bathing outfit. Wrap, sandals, a cap. I've got something very special for you. Tres chic. Paris. I don't think I'll bother. I haven't my checkbook with me. Oh, but this island is like a big ship. You have unlimited credit. [BRIGHT ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Well, how we going to find them? My friend will know. Where is your friend? Johnny! [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] So, that's your friend? Yes, sir. Make it a hit. We have to leave, now. All right. [INAUDIBLE] Where is she? At the moment, I'm not permitted to say. Oh yes, you are, and right now. You are speaking to John C. Lester. I don't like your attitude. No? Oh! [CROWD CHATTERING] So that's what you did? Oh. Johnny. Johnny. Johnny! He's dead! Sergeant Jones! I'm coming. Come to his senses. He is. Yes, sir. [CRASHING] He's not dead. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHATTERING] Everybody seems to know you. Much worse. I know everybody here. Those two, who are they? Just a couple of idealists. Look, he says, sweetheart, I love you. She answered, do you? He says, yes. She, how long? He, forever. Oh, too obvious. Do you think so? What about those two? What are they talking about? Wait a minute. Darling, do you remember the moon-- No, no, no, no, no. You are all wrong. She says, darling, you forgot to pay the bill of my new evening gown. He says, my sweetheart, I didn't forget it. I didn't order it. I won't pay. What's her reaction to that? Just watch. Derulio! You're a dangerous mind-reader. Who else do you want me to describe? Yourself. How would you speak. What would you say? Without thinking. I'm not thinking about what to say, but whether I may or may not say it. May I? How does one get up to that villa? There is a narrow path leading to it straight from your hotel. You can't miss it. You know, everything's mine. It's a wonderful position for a pilot's castle. But it is. On its huge suspended bridge. Heavily armed guards would never let anybody pass but beauty. I suppose its full of ill-gotten gains. What? Robbed treasures. Today, you may call it a collection. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Mama. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Hello. Michael! What are you doing here? Sunbathing. Nice bathing costume. Cost much? I said, did it cost much? What are you playing at? New clothes, expensive hotel, whose money? I have to get the Madonna back. Oh, the Madonna. It's the first time I ever heard anybody use the Madonna as an excuse. Excuse? Excuse for what? Exciting life, beach parties, new clothes, plenty of other things. Don't be silly. The man I was talking to Julian Migone. He's the Italian-American art collector. And he has the Madonna. How interesting! And he's a very charming man. He doesn't want to sell the picture, but he's offered to give i to me. Give it to you! What does he want in return? Are you crazy or just pretending to be? Don't you know what he's after? Don't talk nonsense. Johnny's going to get the picture back. Who? Mr. Lester. I'm afraid you must give up that hope. For the moment, Mr. Lester won't get anything back. Why, what's happened to him? I knocked him out. Where is he now? Lying in hospital, I expect, if there is one in Capri. Oh, it's awful. You've ruined everything. Now, I shall have to get the picture back alone. How? It's none of your business. It is my business. Since when? Since yesterday. Why, what happened yesterday? I kissed you and you kissed me. That's what happened yesterday. Well, really! I don't understand why you should adopt this attitude over such an unimportant little episode. Episode! [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, Michael. Where are you going? And don't lie to me. I know you're going to that villa. Well, as a point of interest, this is the Migone villa? Yes, it is. Thank you. Then you're right. I am going to the villa. Then I'm coming with you. I don't think anybody else has been invited. Now listen to me, Pat. Don't shout at me! I'm not shouting at you. I'm calm and collected. I'm not even angry because I know whatever you're doing is only to get the Madonna back. But not in that way. What's wrong with that way? Don't shout at me, please. At this very moment, that charming gentleman is changing the flowers in his boudoir. He's pouring perfume all over his bedroom. He'll promise you the picture, the villa, the whole of Capri. A hidden orchestra will play beautiful music. He'll give you lots of champagne. And when you with your chicken brain at last realize what it's all about, it'll be too late. Then 'll try to escape and you'll find the door locked. You seem to forget that-- That you're immune because you were in the Navy? Let's stop arguing. I simply forbid you to go to that villa, do you understand? I forbid you. You're mad, absolutely mad. [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] The lady has arrived. Good evening. Oh, how beautiful you are. I just came for a minute, just to see the villa. But you are breathless. Did you run? No, I walked. Won't you sit down, please? Is there a key to that door? Naturally, why? Nothing, I just thought that with so many valuables in the room, you really should lock the door. Oh, I never do. There are no thieves in Capri. You see, this is an island. It's very difficult to take anything out. Oh. I beg your pardon? I just said oh. Can I look around? Certainly, with the greatest pleasure. Very, lovely. Robbed treasures. I have the impression you are looking for something. Oh, whatever makes you think that? I will help you in your embarrassment. Let's talk business. When you dropped your handkerchief on the boat, I realized very well you wanted something from me. Of course, when I picked it up, you knew I might want something from you, too. Tell me, what do you want from me? A picture. It's yours. You don't even know the picture I want. Doesn't matter which one. The picture that you brought from Naples yesterday. Ah, so you know which picture I brought yesterday from Naples? Yes, a Madonna. The Golden Madonna. It doesn't belong to me. And it doesn't belong to you. It belongs to a village. Oh, that is the reason we are wearing such a beautiful gown? Let's have a drink. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] [CHAMPAGNE CORK POPPING] You must not let me drink alone. Where is the picture? Upstairs. I may say, you have exquisite taste. It's very beautiful. I've never seen it. And yet, it is so important to you? Ah, then, you must see. Come. I'll lead the way. Mr. Migone. Uh, couldn't you bring the picture here? My dear, you can ask whatever you wish. The villa, the whole of Capri. There is only one thing you cannot ask from me. To bring the picture to you. You must go to the picture. Where does the music come from? A hidden orchestra. Then I will go. My dear. [WHISTLING] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Can you wait a minute? I will fetch the picture for you. Mr. Migone. Yes? I've thought it over. After all, I'm not in any hurry. Could we have another drink, first? By all means. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] Well? What shall we drink to? To the eternal surprise that only women possess. It's a heavenly night. Will you come now to the picture? Is it in your bedroom? Yes. I'd like another drink. A stronger one. It's strong enough. [WHISTLING] Let's go. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] There it is. That? What is this? A travesty. But where's the Madonna? You tricked me. It has been stolen. Then, if you'll forgive me, I won't even ask what you wanted from me. Good night. Good night. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] Hey, Countess. Johnny! Is this the lady? It must be. Then she's yours. The rest is up to you, now. No one will suspect a countess. I've left a suitcase at your hotel. It's just the right size. Tomorrow morning, go down and get the first boat out of here and scram. OK? Your poor eye. Oh, that's nothing. Hey, tell the Captain, I'm not mad at him. But ask him to keep that straight left in his pocket, next time, will you? Johnny, you're wonderful. You better go now. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [WHISTLING] [LAUGHTER] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Look, I got it. It's the real one. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [CROWD CHATTERING] Hello. Hi there. What rate? [CROWD CHATTERING] [OMINOUS ORCHESTRAL MUSIC] Hey, excuse me. Excuse me, madam, I beg you pardon, ladies. Yes, well, if you don't mind, I won't be a moment. But you see I-- I really do apologize. [HUMMING] I seem to have added-- you know, maybe [INAUDIBLE] ladies. It's rather abnormal. Beg your pardon, Madam. Oh, first class. First class, please. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] I am sorry. Oh, yeah, please, get up front. Pat, what happened? Tell me, what's is all about? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Pat, you stole it. Is it true? Oh, Pat, what a fool I was to think anything else. Pat, it's wonderful. It's wonderful. Pat, I love you. This is the lady in question? Yes. She has stolen the picture? I don't say she's actually stolen the picture. But I am certain she has been planning all this very carefully, up to the last detail. She was an accomplice of this man. That's nonsense. She had nothing to do with all this. They were exchanging information on the rocks yesterday morning. Then, last night, while the lady was pretending to be my guest, she got into my house and took the picture. It's true? No, it's not true. I would be only too delighted if you can refute my assertions. But if the suitcase remains closed, you implicitly admit your guilt. Please open it and prove your innocence. So you admit you are guilty? Now wait a minute, I confess. If anything has been stolen from anybody on this island, I did it. I am the thief. Now open it. Sergente. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] You see? I didn't steal it either. Darling, I'm so glad. What's that for? I just realized why you slapped my face last night. How dare you think such things. Sir, you may go now. You're free. Thank you. I'm deeply sorry, Countess. I didn't know that the gentleman was more than an accomplice to you. He's nothing to me. He's young and charming. I hate him. Full of courage. I never want to see him again. You love him that much? Did I hurt him? I envy him. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] Hello, Contessa. I'm glad you've made it. I was afraid you might be delayed. These Capri police make a fuss about nothing. I wish I'd known you was coming. I could have given you a lift in the car. So you brought the car back? Yes, of course. Nice place you got here, Contessa. My dad had a place like this once, up Tottenham way. Course, it wasn't so big, but it had a lovely garden. They used to train greyhounds there. Hey, Contessa. That's what you ought to do-- train dogs. We could make fortune. What happened? I don't follow, just tell me what happened. Well, I heard there was going to be some sort of fester here today. And I thought they ought to have the Madonna there. The Madonna. The Madonna! How did you find it again? I Stole it from your suitcase. You Stole it? Well, I wasn't going to leave it to an amateur like the Captain. Johnny, where is the picture? There. [MUSIC PLAYING] The Madonna. The Golden Madonna. Here she is. Johnny, you shall have your greyhounds. [SINGING IN ITALIAN] The Madonna! Oh, Madonna. [SHOUTING] [SINGING IN ITALIAN] [PIPE ORGAN MUSIC] [TENSE VIOLIN MUSIC] Do we need a miracle? Look! Rain. The age of miracles is past. [THUNDER] [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING]
