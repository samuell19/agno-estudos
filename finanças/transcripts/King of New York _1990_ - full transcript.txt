How come you never came to see me? Who wanted to see you in a cage, man? Of course. - Later. - Later. Champagne. Let's break it in. Yes. Ah, yes. It's King Tito's. King Tito's glove. Tito's fuckin' glove. It's a good thing he's dead, cos I'd take that glove, I'd wrap it right round his... Sex. And it's how much? Well, wait for the paperback, and you can get it. It's too fuckin' much for me. You should read that book, Joey. Yeah, why? Because I think you might learn somethin'. What? How to be good? - Joey, don't just... don't say a word, OK? - Why not? Because I don't want you to say anything. But we're going home, right? I know. I'm tired already. Where is he? Welcome home, Frank. - Nice to see you. - Good to see you. Nice to see you. Nice to see you. Hi. Thanks for everything. To freedom. Come on. Bill, nice to see you. Bill, Charlie, you know Frank. - How are you? - Good of you to come. Judge, how are you? Nice to see you. Listen, I want to introduce you to... I'm gonna say hello to your junior partner. Hiya, Frank. Good to see you. You should be more careful of the affairs you attend, Counselor. One is known by the company one keeps. Ain't that right, Joey? Pete, how are you? Hey, Frank. Welcome home. Hello, Frank. Welcome back. You know everybody here, I think. Pete, how's the family... Brian, Dennis? Better than when you left town, Frank. They're all working. - How about you? - Back from the dead. Frank White. I've heard a lot about you, and it's all bad. Don't believe everything that Pete writes in the columns because... well... Anyway... I've been reformed. A lot of people will be happy to hear that. Huh, Pete? What can we expect from the reformed Frank White? I want to be mayor. Thinks I'm kidding. But first, I want to talk to Arty Clay. Listen, why don't you relax? We're supposed to be havin' a good time here, you know? Tell him I got things on my mind. I want to talk 'em over with him. The guy's a fuckin' animal. He ain't gonna meet with you. Maybe you can do one of his lieutenants, at best. Tell him... Frank White wants to talk business with him. Just tell him that all I want to know is where and when. You know, Counselor, they did a wonderful job with this gentleman. He's better than ever. If you'll excuse me... I'll see you people in a little while, if I'm still around. Look at you. Look at you. What's the matter? You're not glad to see me? You belonged where they put you. Maybe this time you'll stay out of trouble. That depends on how good my lawyers are. I thought people like you didn't believe in the legal process. I thought people like me were the legal process. You know what? You know what I'd like to do... to you? I would like... to take you on the subway. What can I do for you? Tell Arty I need to speak to him. - Wait here. - Sure. There's some yarm out there that wants to talk to you. Ace is still the better. Arty, you're still... What's happening? What's happening here? You got aces? 200. 200? I got to see your two. Alright. One shot. - Alright. - Last ticket. - Johnny, give me somethin' good here. - Take it easy. Arty. Gentlemen. - Alright, who goes? - Arty. Alright. I bet 200. Go ahead. I got a message from Frank White. He wants to sit down. He wants to talk. You tell him I don't talk to nigger lovers. Ah, let's go. What's down? Well, he says he's got things on his mind he wants to discuss with you, and he wants to know where and he wants to know when. You tell him in fuckin' hell, that's where. He's gonna wish his lawyer left him fuckin' the sambos in the joint when I get through with him. I was makin' a lot of money off them Colombians. That's right. Alright. If that's what you want me to tell him, I'll tell him. What, it ain't clear enough? You tell that son of a bitch he made a big mistake with me. And you tell him somethin' else! This is what Arty Clay has to say. Shit... You tell him personally... from me! - I'm gettin' the fuck outta here. - Stay outta here! Come on, sit down. Let's go. Come on, you go. I missed you. Your watch and your wallet, blood. How about that? Come by the Plaza Hotel. I got work for you. Ask for Frank White. Man, come on. It's up to me, right? You guys are in trouble. I bet 200. OK. Alright, hurry up, will ya? I'm down a lot of money here. Let's play cards. I got your message, Arty. You stupid son of a bitch. You runnin' games here? I want to play. Sure, Frank, play. Bring your friends. Nah. I want to play with Arty. Come on. Let's go, will you? Jump deals. Blackjack. House out. Hey. You got some balls comin' here. Pick up the card. Come on. Pick up the card. Pick it up. OK. From here on, nothin' goes down unless I'm involved... No blackjack, no dope deals, no nothing. A nickel bag gets sold in the park, I want in. You guys got fat while everybody starved on the street. It's my turn. You think you're gonna live long enough to spend that money, you fuckin' hump? If any of you... are tired of gettin' ripped off by guys like that... You come with me. I'm at the Plaza Hotel. You're welcome. You're all welcome... to join! Man or ghost, I'll kill you again. Ed. Ed. Aiesha, how you doin'? You know, I'm very upset about what happened today. I told you, Frank, I did the best I could, and you know that. Edward. How are you? I told you I tried to make it work, Frank. - Hello, Counselor. How are you? - Alisha, how are you? - Aiesha. - Aiesha. The City Councilman was just explaining to me why that hospital in the South Bronx didn't survive the fiscal cut this afternoon. I'm tellin' him about how disappointed I am. I was explaining to Frank that there simply wasn't money in the budget to fund that facility. In a city of 12 million people, I find that hard to believe. I hoped we could do better. I hoped so too, Frank, but there simply was no money in the budget. If you think it's so easy, why don't you try funding it yourself? - Maybe I will. - OK. How about 16 million by the end of the quarter? Tell your friends they'll have the money. Counselor, you're this man's legal advisor. Why don't you explain to him the hard financial facts of running a municipality. I know what this city needs, and privileged districts shouldn't be the only ones with hospitals. Forget it, Frank. Forget it. I want that place kept open. Frank, forget it. The city can't afford it and neither can you. The city doesn't know where to look for the money. Let me give you some very expensive advice. Go someplace where you can stay out of trouble. I thought that's what I pay you for. Excuse me. Hello, Frank. I want to talk to you. I don't think so. Come on. O'Neill can wait for two old friends, can't he? I'm not your friend. Come on, Frank. We missed you while you were away. Thought about you too. - Yeah. I heard a rumor about you. - What's that? I heard you got AIDS getting dicked up your ass in prison. That's what I heard. I thought about you every time I jerked off, dickhead. Look, why don't we just take this outside, OK? Next time, wear a tie. - Get Abe. - Here we go. Excuse us, folks. Excuse us. Easy, easy. Excuse us. Excuse us. Easy. Easy. Here we go. What the hell is this? We're takin' him in for questioning. On what grounds? This is harassment, Bishop. We're goin' to the precinct. You're welcome to come along. Even your client's got a right to counsel. Come on, get out! Look inside. Let's go. - What's that? - You tell me. I don't know. This is the only chance you get, White. What's it gonna be? - Are you arresting me? - Oh, fuck. Here we go. If so, do it. If not, I got people waitin' for me. Shut the fuck up, motherfucker! - Hey, Frank. - Alright, that's it. Come here, Frank. Come here! Here, Frank, meet somebody. Meet somebody, huh? - Piece of shit! - Alright! That's it! I'll kill the motherfucker! No, I'm gonna cap him. Let me cap the mo... Get in the fuckin' car! Get in the car. This how you do things? I know what you're up to, White. Forget it. I'm gonna make you and your friends disappear long before that. Welcome home, fuck face. Gilley, get in the fuckin' car. Last fuckin' time, you fuck. We're onto your fuckin' ass. Give your friends that message. Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? The best man has somethin' to say. Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank Tommy Flanigan for bein' the only black male at an Irish wedding. Are you comfortable, Tom? - I'm from the South. - Are you comfortable? Yeah, real comfortable. All my buddies here, all my brothers. He's sweatin'. OK. Joe? Joe Mulligan, father of the bride. Come on up here, Joe. Joe provided these lovely decorations for us. Where'd you get these, Joe, an AA meeting? Not only that, he paid for the whole thing. The whole 200 dollars. Joe, by the way, put your shotgun away. The test came back negative. There you go. Alright. Alright. Roy Bishop, do I detect a little afro sheen on that unusually wavy hair of yours? Tip... Kathy... to the finest couple I've ever had the pleasure to know. Join me, folks. They're the only couple that's still together in this neighborhood. I wish you health, wealth, happiness, a lot of babies, no cops. We don't need no more degenerate donkeys runnin' around with guns. All bullshit aside, I think I speak for everybody, we love you. - God bless. - Hear, hear. Here's to youse. How did I do? I'm proud of you. Hey, Father, thank you for coming. Let's get Father laid. Come here. Give me a real drink. Get Dennis a drink over here. Get the house a drink. The bar's not open though. You pay. That's my wife! It was a fuckin' joke! Would you relax? Virginia, come here. Come here. Excuse me. Tip, take a tip. Gilley's after your wife. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Hell, it's more than obvious. He'll find the vampire marks sunk into her neck. Get outta here! What's what, my friend? How you doin'? What's what? Terrific. Yeah? How come you're not dancin'? I'm gonna leave that to the father of the bride. Are you sure you're gonna make it through the night? Aw, shit. You kiddin'? I'm the one that needs the honeymoon. All they do is stay in bed all fuckin' night. Do me a favor, huh? Give this to the kids. I got a million things to do. Wish 'em my love. - You sure you won't come in? - Nah. I got a million things to do. - I'll see you durin' the week. - Alright. You take it easy, huh? Take care, pops. You can tell your boyfriend to forget about it. He ain't got enough money. Maybe he'll surprise you. I don't like his fucking surprises. He's got a lot of nerve even sendin' you here. You could step all over that shit and still get 120 a gram. And I got 220 pounds of it. Comes to 15 mil, street value. And I want guarantees nobody in this town can give. Especially him. Look, Larry, why don't you set the terms? Then I'll go back and I'll tell Frank. If you two see eye to eye, we'll make a deal. If not, everybody goes their own way still friends. What do you say? That cocksucker ain't got no friends. And before I even think of sitting across some table with him, he got to know one thing... I ain't no fuckin' greaseball named Arty Clay. You got it. And he pays for your cut. Yeah. Why don't you stick around? I got Frankenstein coming on next. Stop fuckin' with my lady. You know what I'm sayin'? I told him, stop fuckin' with my bitch. And when he started cryin' like a bitch, he got fucked like a bitch. You know what I'm sayin'? Hey, Joe, your juicy friend's a-wastin'. We're gonna shoot the bitch! We'll just shoot the bitch! Hey, Joe. What you want, man? Don't forget the hot sauce. Alright. You want white meat, right? - No dark meat! - No problem. - Alright? - Don't shoot me! Don't shoot me! Yeah, can I help you? Can you help me? Yeah, you can start by givin' me 15 pieces of chicken, motherfucker. Mix it up. I want barbecue, and I want crispy. - You gettin' this all down? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I want six pieces of corn, and I want... yeah, give me eight spareribs, and give me 12 pieces of shrimp... some onion rings. You want tartar sauce or ketchup on those, man? I want tartar sauce. You got any potato salad? No, we ain't got potato sal... Look, get away from the games! Alright? You ain't got no money. Just get away from the games, alright? What the fuck is the matter with you, talkin' to them like that? They ain't got no money, man. Yo, is that it? Yeah, that's it. Make sure you get my food, get it now, and don't be droolin' on it, man. And I better not get none of that cat. I want chicken. Here you are. Here. Y'all go play the games. No offense, ma'am... but you make sure they get what they want, huh? - Go on. - No, go ahead. Go ahead. Y'all go play them games. Hear? Play them games. Here, baby. Here. Go play the games. Go ahead. Yo, what's happenin' with the food, man? What's up? - I ain't got all day, you know. - That'll be 56.70, total. Did I say I was finished? I want somethin' to drink. Maybe I want some birch beer. You got birch beer? - No, we don't have no birch beer. - You don't even know what that shit is. - You got any root beer? - No. We ain't got no root beer either. - Yeah, well, how much is this? - 56.90. 56.90? Fuck you very much. Hey, scumbag, guess what? You're under fuckin' arrest. Yeah, motherfucker? How about that? Police! It's all over, Jimmy. You're under arrest for the murder of Miguel Mata, Salvador Tito, and Rafael Santo Domingo. You have the right to remain silent so shut the fuck up. What's this, huh? Did you use this on Mata? Yeah. Yeah, same one I'm gonna use on you, punk. Laugh now, motherfucker, but for the rest of your life, you gonna be somebody's bitch, some motherfucker named Bubba. But you're a motherfucking bro! Don't you slap me, motherfucker. I'm gonna slap the black off you. Take the cuffs off, you motherfucker! I'm gonna finish his ass off! This is the happiest day of my life. You know why? Cos we got a real, live, talkin' witness. I don't leave no witnesses! Oh, yeah, motherfucker? Well, you must be gettin' old. I'll teach you to fuck with my friend. I'm gonna fuck you up! Without private assistance, everything we've seen will close down. I can't stress enough how much your help could mean to the thousands of families that depend on us for medical care. Please, just look around. Look, Larry... the most anybody's gonna give you for your stuff is 30 grand a key. That's about three million dollars on a bulk sale. So whoever buys it's gonna turn around, cut it, bag it, and sell it on the street for 120, 150 a gram. That's 150,000 dollars a key, five times what they paid you. So now your quintal's worth 15 million dollars, a markup of 11 million something that you get no part of. I know you don't have the manpower to peddle the uptown streets, but I do. You put up the stuff, I put up the guys to sell it. I take the heat and the risk... if there is any. We divide the difference, setting aside something for places like this. What do you say? Thank you. If I was into socialized medicine, I would have stayed in the Peking province. I want cash for my goods. - How much? - Three million up front... Like you said, with another half a mil when you unload it. - That's a lot of money. - Well, I got a lot of shit. Make up your mind. Very well. You know somethin', Frank? This conversation made me realize just how fuckin' crazy you really are. It's all set up. I don't think you should go alone. I don't trust that crazy Chinese guy. Know what I mean? It's Enrico Mata. They got him recovering in a hospital somewhere with a police guard around him 24 hours. He's agreed to testify for them in court. They got Jump cold this time, Frank. It's murder one. Did Abe get them to set bail? - A million dollars apiece. - So go sign him out. Posting that kind of money's gonna raise more problems than it solves, Frank. Also, I want you to get Abe to talk to some of those friends of his, see if they can't get this cop transferred or retired or somethin'. I want him out of my way. He's Chief Investigating Officer on a multiple homicide. - It's stupid to even think about it. - Ask him... before I blow Bishop's brains all over his fucking wing tips. Get some guys and pick... pick him up. You got it, Frank. - Hope you had a good time. - My old man's back. - That's right. - You gonna drink with us? Yo, yo, yo! The Captain Crunch and that Doughnut Crew is here. Yo, fellas, what's up? Long time no see. Bishop, we havin' a party downtown. Why don't you bring Howdy Doody and the Chocolate Wonder. I hear your mother's gonna be there, man, we havin' a real good time down there, you know what I'm sayin'... Give me some. Black man. Here. Some flowers for your witness. - Jimmy, we got business to do. - Right. We got business to do. Get some cheap ones. And you can kiss my ass, too. I'll see you downtown. You'll be alright? OK. Yeah. What? Proud of yourself, Counselor? Yeah. You know, if you got a problem, take it to the judge. Hi. Come on, come on! Let's go! Let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Where's the stuff, Larry? And now, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Freddy Jackson. All my life I've been waitin' For a time when I'd be free How I prayed For liberation And a little bit of dignity I heard the heartbeat of the city How it pounded and it sounded in the night The children's voices were so pretty I'm gonna reach out, I'm gonna take it I'm gonna make it alright Dream on For a better day Where we can live our lives out And our hopes don't fade away Dream on For a better way We'll join our hands together And build a brand-new day Dream on... Thank you. Thank you. You're all so tremendous. I was born in this neighborhood, and as I grew up here, I used to pray that once I got out, I would never have a reason to come back. I'm glad those prayers weren't answered, because my neighborhood's lookin' mighty pretty lately. And I've been encouraged, both in public and in private, that where there's a will to help, there's a way to do it. So on behalf of the neighborhood council, myself, and New York City, I want to thank you for what you've done, and I ask for your continued support until we have the kind of general hospital this borough needs. I'm gonna reach out, I'm gonna take it I'm gonna make it alright Dream on For all that could be right We can make it happen We can make it paradise Dream on For a better way We'll join our hands together And build a brand-new day Dream on We're reporting live from the benefit at the Harlem ballroom, where city luminaries are gathered to celebrate the long-term project to rebuild the community general hospital. As one prominent local politician said to me, it's a proud moment for the city and all New Yorkers. Officials from state and city agencies... Roy, he's a movie star. Frank is a fuckin' movie star now. Oh, my God. Help me, gentlemen. A toast. - A toast. - A toast. Come on, toast. Frank. He made it. - Alright? - Fucking king of New York. The king of New York. King. We, on the other hand, we waste our time interrogating witnesses, liftin' fingerprints... my favorite and yours... court orders... right, Roy? Court orders so Frank's Park Avenue attorney can get him out in ten minutes. Ten minutes later he's on the street. I thought we were what's right. I thought the law counted for somethin'. But this whole system favors the scumbag. We make, what, 36,000 dollars a year? - 36.5. - 36.5. Thank you. I was the best man at your wedding... Thank you very much. 36.5 to risk our lives every night of the week, and Frank gets rich on killin' people. Roy. Roy... There's only one way to get Frank. We can make it look like a rival gang, if that makes you feel any better. You gonna shoot everybody you can't arrest, Dennis? That's not your fuckin'... You know what my problem is with you? I can't do my job. My job is to protect the people of this city, and you won't let me. You do anything stupid, I'm comin' after your ass. With or without you... I'm gonna get rid of Frank. OK? So now you know. This guy belongs in a fuckin' rubber nut squad. He's a nut. You know, Roy, every time Frank kills somebody out there... it's our fault. Can you live with that? I can't. It was Saturday night and I was feelin' kind of sporty Went to the bar, caught me a .40 Got kinda high and, kinda drunk So I kicked the ass of this little punk Forgot my key, I had to ring my bell My mama came down, she said, who the hell? Wait, Mama, wait, it's me, your little son Before I knew it, my mum pulled a gun I know who you are, but who the hell is that? I turned around, man, this bitch was fat I really don't know how she got into the car I must have picked her up when I left the bar You know, homey, homey, man, I wanted to chill But you know how mothers are, she wanted to ill So I said, hey, baby, is you on the pill? Cos tonight I want to be your lover Just one thing, I forgot to buy a rubber Waited a little while and then we snuck upstairs... Somethin' that you've looked at all your life... it crosses your mind that you'll never see it again. I've lost a lot of time. It's gone. From here on, I can't waste any. If I can have a year or two, I'll make somethin' good. I'll do somethin'... somethin' good. Just one year, that's all. I want to get into a significant instrument or a series of instruments with respect to the buying of the dollar against the yen, not against the Deutsche mark or against the Swiss franc or any other currency. That's Salvador Tito, Miguel Mata, Emilio el Zapa, Arthur Clay, Lawrence Wong. Take a good look, Counselor. You represent the man responsible for that. Are you out of your mind? You're a lawyer. You're a member of the bar. - How can you be part of this? - Part of what? Can't pretend you don't know what he's doin' out there. I don't pretend anything. You got evidence, prosecute. By then it'll be too late. Bring him in. We're gonna go see Frank, alright?

When the DA's office investigated the sudden death of Arty Clay, they found that he left a 13-million dollar estate. How do you explain that? Then there's Larry Wong, who owned half of Chinatown when he passed away. Larry used to rent his tenements to Asian refugees, his own people, for 800 dollars a month to share a single toilet on the same floor. How about King Tito? He had 13-year-old girls hookin' for him on the street. Those guys are dead because I don't want to make money that way. Emil Zapa... The Mata brothers, they're dead because they were runnin' this city into the ground. You expected to get away with killing all these people? I spent half my life in prison. I never got away with anything, and I never killed anybody that didn't deserve it. Who made you judge and jury? Well, it's a tough job, but somebody's gotta do it, you know? For the likes of Arty Clay and the rest of those bums, you slap a tag on me for 50,000 dollars. You make me public enemy number one. Is that some kind of joke? Well, I got a message for you and your friends. You tell 'em I got a quarter-million dollar contract on anyone involved in this case. Now we all get to know what it's like livin' without knowin' when some asshole's gonna step outta the dark and blow your head off. I want you to know what it's like to live that way. You tell 'em what I said. What makes you think you're gonna be around long enough to see that? Where's the fuckin' phone? We're not talkin' about me. We're talkin' about takin' over drug cartels. You think ambushin' me in some nightclub's gonna stop what makes people take drugs? This country spends a hundred billion dollars a year on gettin' high, and it's not because of me. All that time I was wasting in jail, you know, it just got worse. I'm not your problem. I'm just a businessman. Take out your piece. Be careful. Careful. The cuffs. Cuff yourself to the chair. It's a stupid thing to do, huh? Sit down. Put 'em on the chair. Now you know what it's like. Welcome to the circle. Bang, bang. White. A man with a price on his head shouldn't ride the subway. It's over. Let it go. You let it go. See this? Come on. You want to see somethin'? How bad do you want me? Don't worry, but don't move. Frank, put the gun down. And make it easy? I've done things in my life you wouldn't even think about. Why should you be different? You got that gun, use it. Come on. No more stories, Frank. Put the fuckin' gun down. See this woman? Nice woman. You have a family? I don't want to hurt you, but I'll blow you away if I have to, understand? Yes, sir. Could you do that? Leave her alone, Frank. It's me and you. Me and you. You can't hide behind her forever. I don't need forever. Just drive.
